<P>That he would grant unto us, that we, being de|livered out of the hands of our enemies, might &s;erve him, without fear, in holine&s;s and righte|ou&s;ne&s;s before him, all the days of our lives.</P></Q>

<P>_THESE words are part of the &s;ong of Zacharias, at the birth of John. The good man expre&s;&s;es his faith in Chri&s;t, who was quickly to ap|pear, as
<Q>the mercy promi&s;ed to our fathers,</Q>
in &s;ending whom God did
<Q>remember his holy covenant, the oath which he &s;ware to our father Abraham.</Q>
The character, in which he views the Me&s;&s;ias, is that of a glorious deliverer coming, in the fullne&s;s of ages, to re&s;cue his people out of the hand of all their enemies. Whatever views Zacharias might have of Chri&s;t, as a &s;piritual &s;aviour, coming to deliver mankind from the tyranny of &s;in and &s;atan: As al&s;o from the empire of death and the grave, which have
<PB N="6" REF="011130_0004_0F857F856A6DD100">
reigned from the fall; yet, it is not, that I know of, at all ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that he expected, when the Me&s;&s;ias &s;hould appear, that he would al&s;o de|liver I&s;rael from their temporal enemies, from the Roman yoke, under which they were groan|ing. This was the general expectation of the Jews, and even the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, on every occa&s;ion, betrayed their rai&s;ed expectations of &s;uch a glorious deliverance.</P>
<P>The text naturally leads me to di&s;cour&s;e on the enemies of God's people, and the ways and means, the times and occa&s;ions, when and by which, Chri&s;t accompli&s;hes the deliverance of his people from their enemies. But my views, at this time, are not &s;o exten&s;ive; what I propo&s;e, as not un&s;uita|ble for our meditation this day, is to take a con|ci&s;e view of the dealings of God with his people in <HI>this</HI> land; and to &s;hew by what means he hath delivered <HI>us</HI> out of the hands of our enemies.&mdash; Having done which, I &s;hall point out our great obligations, being thus delivered out of the hands of our enemies, to
<Q>&s;erve him in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s all the days of our lives.</Q></P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall briefly con&s;ider the enemies that God's people in this land have been called to engage, the tryals and difficulties they have met with, the dangers they have e&s;caped, and how God, at one time and another, hath graciou&s;ly appeared for them, and delivered us out of the hand of our ene|mies. In pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign I &s;hall &s;tudy all po&s;&s;ible brevity, begging your candour and pa|tience, hoping what I &s;hall &s;ay will not be unpro|fitable, e&s;pecially to our young people, who have
<PB N="7" REF="011130_0005_0F857F861CBEDF18">
not had con&s;iderable advantages to know the won|derful acts of the Lord. And, from the whole, may we &s;o feel our hearts affected with the great things God hath done for us, as to lead us to re|pentance, and engage us to
<Q>make them known to our children, that the generations to come may know them&mdash;that they may &s;et their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments.</Q> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 78.5, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>The whole continent of America was, to the antients, an unknown land. It is not quite 300 years &s;ince the fir&s;t di&s;covery was made of this part of the world, <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Columbus made the fir&s;t di&s;covery of America 1492.</NOTE> the Spaniards began their &s;ettlements and the conque&s;t of the va&s;t kingdoms of Mexico and Peru, about an hundred years be|fore our fathers came into this country. <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Cortes &s;ailed from Spain 1518, and the next year began the conque&s;t of Mexico.</NOTE> It is not certain that ever any European was at New-England before the year 1602. Some feeble at|tempts were made to effect a &s;ettlement, in &s;everal parts of this country, but none &s;ucceeded until the year 1620; when the adventurers landed at Ply|mouth and began a &s;ettlement there, which may fitly be called the beginning of New-England. No con&s;iderable additions were made to the plan|ters, until the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing times in England lead many worthy and &s;erious per&s;ons to &s;eek a quiet habitation, in the&s;e de&s;olate parts of the earth.</P>
<P>It is a truth, impo&s;&s;ible to be denied, that the &s;piritual tyranny, under which our fathers groaned, and their being inhibited the wor&s;hip of God, ac|cording
<PB N="8" REF="011130_0006_0F857F897897CEE8">
to the light of their own con&s;ciences, was the cau&s;e of their leaving their native country, to plant them&s;elves in this howling wilderne&s;s. It was this abridgment of the rights of con&s;cience that began and mightily a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ettlement of this country. The oppre&s;&s;ion under which a valuable part of the nation groaned, has, in the hand of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, proved, in its con|&s;equences, a great ble&s;&s;ing to the world, and the occa&s;ion of a va&s;t addition to the Briti&s;h empire, and glory, as well, as of a glorious enlargement of the kingdom of the redeemer. The Lord our God hath turned the cur&s;e into a ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;He meant it for good to &s;ave much people alive, and to rai&s;e up a new people, as the &s;tars of heaven for multitude.</P>
<P>A few years after the &s;ettlement of New-England began, the troubles in England were greatly in|crea&s;ed, and arbitrary mea&s;ures were driven on, both in church and &s;tate. Arch-bi&s;hop Laud, and the ruling eccle&s;ia&s;tics of that day, then drove a multitude of con&s;cientious puritans from their country. After &s;ome fruitle&s;s attempts had been made to form &s;ettlements in other places, in the year 1629 a con&s;iderable number of per&s;ons (350) &s;eated them&s;elves at Salem, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a church there. And the next year John Winthrop, and Thomas Dudley, E&s;qrs; afterward governours of the colony, and &s;everal gentlemen of di&s;tinction, with divers worthy Mini&s;ters, and above 200 pa&s;&s;engers arrived in <HI>this</HI> Bay, began their &s;ettle|ments and founded churches: And by the conti|nual acce&s;&s;ion to their numbers, and the arrival of parties from divers places in England, in the &s;pace
<PB N="9" REF="011130_0007_0F857F8A57995220">
of &s;even years, there were, not only &s;ettlements be|gan and churches erected, in Charle&s;town, Bo&s;ton, Dorche&s;ter, Roxbury, Cambridge and Watertown, but, in that time, great numbers had emigrated as far as the fertile banks of Connecticut river, and planted the now populous and flouri&s;hing towns of Sprinfield, Hartford, Wind&s;or and Weathers|field: And, by the coming over of new inhabitants, the foundations were laid of the antient colonies of New-Haven &amp; Connecticut, &s;ince formed into one.</P>
<P>But what I de&s;ign is not to give you an hi&s;tory of the progre&s;&s;ive improvements of the country, &s;o much as to point out the hard&s;hips they con|quered, and the enemies out of who&s;e hand God did deliver them.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the difficulties, &s;traits, hard&s;hips and perils which attend the &s;ettlement of a new country; e&s;pecially, at the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and leagues from a civilized people. It mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place, have been a mo&s;t affectionate parting, that they had with their native country, their hou&s;es and lands; their friends and relatives, whom they were for&s;aking without any pro&s;pect of ever meeting again in this world. The thought of venturing over an extended ocean, then very much unknown, mu&s;t have been terrible to per&s;ons that never went to &s;ea, and, e&s;pecially, to women of tender minds. The pro&s;pect of venturing on an unknown and barbarous &s;hore, to the fir&s;t ad|venturers, mu&s;t have been quite perplexing. But when all the tryals and difficulties were pa&s;&s;ed through, it was in hunger and cold, in peril and fear, that they began and pro&s;ecuted their &s;ettle|ments.
<PB N="10" REF="011130_0008_0F857F8B20C61B30">
It is impo&s;&s;ible for us to conceive what many &s;uffered by the fatigues of a long voyage, by cold and famine, in a de&s;olate country, where they were immediately expo&s;ed to the &s;everities of a rigid climate, without any convenient habitations to cover them. The hard&s;hips they underwent brought many to their graves within a few months after their arrival. Of the fir&s;t 350 who arrived at Salem, not le&s;s than 100 died the following win|ter, of di&s;ea&s;es, principally, brought upon them by the hard&s;hips they endured. Of the people, who fir&s;t arrived at Plymouth, two or three months &s;wept half of them into the grave. Truly, we cannot but admire the hand of God that &s;upported and animated them under the&s;e tryals. Their principal comfort was, that, with all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a new country, they found them&s;elves out of the reach of prelatical tyranny; they could enjoy God in his ordinances.</P>
<P>America, when fir&s;t di&s;covered, was found, in every part of it, inhabited by a &s;avage &s;warthy peo|ple. The learned have been much puzzled to determine the original of the natives of this va&s;t continent. Some have conjectured they were ori|ginally Tartars who found a northern path into America; and &s;ome that they are the de&s;cendents of the ten tribes, carried into captivity by Salmane&s;er, and planted in the northern kingdoms of A&s;ia. <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 18.11.</NOTE> Others derive their origin from the antient Pheni|cians who are famed for their early &s;kill in navi|gation, who certainly &s;ent forth colonies in very early ages. Others, and perhaps with greater pro|bability, &s;uppo&s;e that they were at different times
<PB N="11" REF="011130_0009_0F857F8BD23E16F8">
and on various occa&s;ions, either accidentally, or by de&s;ign, tran&s;planted from various parts of the other continent; but when and how no man can tell. After all our enquiries their origin is quite problematical. However, this is certain, they mu&s;t have been here many ages; for we find them &s;cattered throughout every part of North and South America: They inhabited, not only the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, but the va&s;t inland country al&s;o. The Spaniards found millions of Indians in the countries they conquered, and the va&s;t kingdoms of Peru, and Mexico &s;eem to have had the marks of con|&s;iderable antiquity. Our fathers, upon their arrival in this country, found every part of it was, or had been, peopled with tribes or Indians, who could give no account of their original. One thing is very remarkable in the di&s;pen&s;ation of providence; a few years before the arrival of the people at Ply|mouth, there is no doubt but God was plea&s;ed to &s;end a dreadful &s;ickne&s;s among the natives, who were before very numerous, and probably would have be&s;tired them&s;elves to hinder &s;trangers from making &s;ettlements in their country. By this vi|&s;itation, it is &s;aid, great numbers were &s;wept off, and &s;ome whole tribes became, in a manner, ex|tinct. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts tribe, particularly, are &s;aid to have been reduced from thirty thou&s;and, to three hundred fighting men. Some &s;ay nine tenths of the barbarians, through the country, were &s;wept off, and the land was, in a manner, depopulated. Some have conjectured, becau&s;e the &s;mall pox has proved &s;o mortal to Indians, that this was the di&s;temper which depopulated the country, but the Indians give an account of the di&s;ea&s;e that does not &s;o well agree to the &s;mall pox. According to
<PB N="12" REF="011130_0010_0F857F8C1FC25348">
them it was a pe&s;tilential putred fever. Some however, think it was the plague, and tell us the &s;avages &s;hewed tho&s;e &s;cars which proved it to be the plague. But whatever the de&s;temper was, it was a wonderful providence thus to prepare the way for our fathers. When the mo&s;t high would bring over a vine and plant it, he prepared room before it, and by his own hand cut off the heathen, who might otherwi&s;e have di&s;appointed the de&s;igns of our fathers.
<Q>Who&s;o is wi&s;e, and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things, even they &s;hall under&s;tand the lov|ing kindne&s;s of the Lord.</Q> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 107.43.</NOTE></P>
<P>At the beginning of the&s;e &s;ettlements Heaven was plea&s;ed wonderfully to lay re&s;traints upon the remaining &s;avages, &s;o that the Europeans gained a peaceable &s;ettlement among them.
<Q>When they were but a few men in number, yea very few and &s;trangers&mdash;he &s;uffered no man to do them wrong, yea he reproved kings for their &s;akes, &s;aying, touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</Q> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 105.12, 14, 15.</NOTE> And le&s;t, after all, the &s;avages &s;hould prove too hard for them, in 1633, the &s;mall pox made dreadful havock among them, and &s;wept away almo&s;t whole plantations of Indians. This further conduced to the &s;afety of the people, and, probably, hindred the plotting of the natives to de&s;troy their new neighbours.</P>
<P>It was not long, however, after their arrival, that our fathers found the &s;avages, with &s;trong pro|fe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, con&s;piring, in one place and another, to cut them off. In the fir&s;t year after their arrival in this colony, when a mortal &s;ickne&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="011130_0011_0F857F8CDAC44B80">
was daily le&s;&s;ening their numbers, when there was not corn enough to feed them a fortnight, they were alarmed with the news of a general con&s;piracy of the Indians to extirpate the Engli&s;h. Only two years after (viz. in 1632) a con&s;piracy of the ea&s;tern Indians to cut off our &s;ettlements was di&s;covered, and by a &s;tratagem prevented. The &s;ame year the whole plantation was under fearful apprehen&s;ions of being driven off by the French, by order of Cardinal Richlieu, which put them on providing for their own defence. And it was nothing but the want of union among them&s;elves that re&s;trained the &s;avages from breaking up all our &s;ettlements, which were generally utterly defencele&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t open war with the &s;avages was what is called the Pequod war in 1637. The tribe of that name was &s;ettled in Connecticut colony, and were very mi&s;chevious to the Engli&s;h, falling upon them in their fields and in their journeys, commit|ting &s;everal murders among them. The &s;everal Engli&s;h plantations found it nece&s;&s;ary, for their own defence, to carry on a war with this tribe, with their united force. This war was carried into the Pequod country, where their garri&s;ons were de&s;troyed and their hou&s;es burnt; 700 of that tribe were killed or taken pri&s;oners, with very little lo&s;s on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h: In &s;hort, the whole nation was in a few months totally extirpated, and this de&s;truction &s;truck &s;uch a terror into the other tribes, that they came and begged for peace, and the land had re&s;t for near forty years.</P>
<P>During the &s;even fir&s;t years from the &s;ettlement of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, there was a great flock|ing
<PB N="14" REF="011130_0012_0F857F8DFAEE6918">
into the country, &s;o that in a few years not le&s;s than 4000 planters had fixed them&s;elves up and down in the country, and laid the foundation of many flouri&s;hing towns and villages in New-Eng|land. Above &s;eventy mini&s;ters accompanied them, generally, learned and pious divines: About forty churches were gathered, and the foundation of that &s;chool of the prophets was laid, which by its annual &s;treams, hath made glad the city of our God&mdash; the wilderne&s;s began to be &s;ubdued, orchards were planted, and laws were enacted for the government of the infant &s;tate.</P>
<P>But even in its infant &s;tate, New-England was not without its enemies at <HI>home,</HI> as well as in its own bo&s;om. A.B. Laud, the grand enemy of civil and religious liberty, while he was per&s;ecu|ting good men at home, kept a jealous eye upon New-England&mdash;and employed enemies, fal&s;e bre|thren &s;ecreted among them&s;elves, to give notice of every thing that pa&s;&s;ed; e&s;pecially of what might be improved to the di&s;advantage of the colony. He envyed the puritans an a&s;ylum in the&s;e parts of the earth, and was plotting their ruin.</P>
<P>As early as 1637, he procured an order of court to prohibit the exportation of inhabitants to New-England, at which time &s;uch great men as Pym, Hampden, Sir Arthur Ha&s;elreig, and Oliver Crom|wel, afterward lord protector of England, were prevented from &s;ettling them&s;elves in this land. God in his providence re&s;erved them for more im|portant &s;ervices in their own country. And after all the calumny and reproach, which have been ca&s;t on their memories for more than a century of
<PB N="15" REF="011130_0013_0F857F8E792F7338">
years, the world is obliged to acknowledge their greatne&s;s, and that to them the nation is greatly obliged for the important liberties it hath &s;ince en|joyed. &mdash;After the breaking out of the civil war, the cau&s;e of exile was, in a manner, taken away; the acce&s;&s;ion of inhabitants greatly cea&s;ed, and &s;ome returned from <HI>this,</HI> to their native country: Un|til the re&s;toration of Charles II. when the per&s;ecu|tion again&s;t prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters was renewed with greater vigour than ever.</P>
<P>In 1642, there was a general de&s;ign among the Indians to cut off the Engli&s;h inhabitants. They were to go, under pretence of trade, in &s;mall parties to the Engli&s;h hou&s;es, and, while &s;ome &s;ecured the arms, others were to perpetrate the dreadful ma&s;|&s;acre. This horrid con&s;piracy was di&s;covered by &s;ome of the Indians them&s;elves. The di&s;covery cau&s;ed a dreadful con&s;ternation: But, by the ex|traordinary pains taken by the inhabitants to pre|vent any &s;urprize, the &s;avages were di&s;couraged from their bloody attempt.</P>
<P>In 1653, a general alarm was &s;pread through the colonies, by the information given by the In|dians, from &s;everal quarters, that the Dutch were privately &s;olliciting the Indians to a general con|federacy, in order totally to extirpate the Engli&s;h. But the di&s;covery of the plot was, probably, the means of preventing its execution.</P>
<P>For the &s;pace of near 40 years, from the Pequod war, though New-England was &s;ometimes alarmed and put into great con&s;ternation, yet, in general, the country had re&s;t, and there was, during this time, a &s;urprizing increa&s;e of inhabitants; until

the breaking out of that, which is commonly called Phillip's war, becau&s;e it was begun and carried on by an Indian prince of that name, a mortal enemy to the Engli&s;h. He re&s;olved on nothing le&s;s than the total de&s;truction of the Engli&s;h. For this pur|po&s;e he invited all the barbarous tribes to join him, furni&s;hed them with arms, and &s;uddenly began the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war that ever New-England felt. This war
<Q>endangered the very being of the co|lony, and it was a que&s;tion with &s;ome, whether the Indians would not prevail to a total exterpa|tion of the Engli&s;h inhabitants.</Q> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Lieut.

<P>It was in 1675, June 24. the war was actually begun, by an attack on the town of Swanzey, and the murder of &s;everal of the inhabitants.

<P>In 1695, the &s;avages continued their depredati|ons, and committed &s;everal murders on the fron|tiers, and, no farther from home than Billerica, they killed and captivated fifteen per&s;ons.</P>
<P>On the next year, 1696, the Engli&s;h-fort at Pemaquid, the &s;tronge&s;t garri&s;on in the ea&s;tern country, was taken and demoli&s;hed.

A con&s;iderable army <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Five hundred men.</NOTE> was rai&s;ed and &s;ent to oppo&s;e them; but God was plea&s;ed to deliver the country from their fears, and nothing extraordinary was attempted by the enemy. The inhabitants, all along the frontiers, were obliged to &s;hut them&s;elves up in garri&s;ons, and were greatly hindred from their labours. The Indians were e|very where upon the watch, and when an oppor|tunity pre&s;ented, &s;eized or killed tho&s;e that ventur|ed abroad.&mdash;We, who &s;it every one under his own

<P>In 1697, we were threatned with a powerful in|va&s;ion from France.&mdash;The king of France had his heart much &s;et on this expedition. A large fleet was ordered to &s;ail from the ports of France, as early in the year as po&s;&s;ible, to attack Bo&s;ton. A numerous army from Canada was de&s;tined to join the fleet, on the ea&s;tern frontiers: The army was ready to march at a few days warning. The fleet actually &s;ailed from France, and arrived in America. The de&s;igned inva&s;ion was known in the country, and every day expected, for &s;everal weeks toge|ther. A report was &s;pread in Bo&s;ton, that a for|midable fleet had been &s;een on the coa&s;t. The in|habitants, as well they might be, were put into con&s;ternation and amazement. They expected every day to be attacked; there were no hopes of a Briti&s;h fleet to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. The be&s;t preparati|ons were however made, by a brave and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people, to receive their enemies&mdash;The militia was held in readine&s;s to march to the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, and their principal fortre&s;&s;es were put into the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence. The alarm continued for &s;e|veral weeks, all which time, they daily expected to be attacked. But Heaven was plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to appear for their help, and, by a train of di&s;ap|pointments, fru&s;trated the de&s;igns the enemy had formed again&s;t us. Be&s;ides, by rea&s;on of the pre|parations making in Canada, to &s;trike this impor|tant

<P>On the beginning of the next year, 1698, the Indians &s;urprized Andover and Haverhill, burned &s;everal hou&s;es, and killed many of the inhabitants, leading &s;ome into dreadful captivity: And the treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick,</HI> which re&s;tored peace to Eng|land and France, did not quickly deliver our fron|tiers from the Indian enemy.

<P>In the year 1698, after many years ince&s;&s;ant war with the French and Savages, peace was re&s;tored to our frontiers. But it's duration was &s;hort. For on the breaking out of Q. Anne's war with France, 1703, New-England was again involved in an ex|pen&s;ive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war, which, during the cour&s;e of ten years, required the utmo&s;t exertion of this people: It's weight fell principally on this unfortunate Colony. It grieves me to repre&s;ent to you the &s;ufferings, di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments of this unhappy people. But, as it may remind us of our obligations to God, who has often appeared for us in &s;ea&s;ons of peculiar di&s;tre&s;s, I &s;hall give you a &s;ummary view of the &s;eries of calamities, which be|fel us, during that long war.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t con&s;iderable on&s;et of the Indians was on the town of Deerfield, on the night following the 28th of February.&mdash;In the dead of night the whole town was attacked, by 300 French and

Indians. They &s;lew about forty per&s;ons, and, the next morning, leaving the hou&s;es and barns in flames, they took their departure, carrying away about 100 captives, among whom was the mini&s;ter of the town, <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Rev. Mr. Williams.</NOTE> a native of <HI>this place,</HI> with his wife and five children, leaving two of his children dead, and his hou&s;e in flames.&mdash;The tender hu&s;band was quickly &s;eperated from his feeble &s;pou&s;e, and, not long after, had the affecting tidings that &s;he, fatigued with travel, had the hatchet of her cruel ma&s;ter &s;truck in her brains.&mdash;Oh! the di&s;tre&s;s that an affectionate hu&s;band mu&s;t have felt at &s;uch a relation as this!&mdash;Several expen&s;ive expeditions were undertaken, which had no great effect, unle&s;s that they might &s;trike terror into the &s;avages, and prevent their &s;o frequent on&s;ets on our &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>In 1704, the enemy were very active, and made &s;everal attacks upon our unwalled villages. Three or four hundred French and Indians came down to Lanca&s;ter, and burnt the meeting hou&s;e, and many dwelling hou&s;es, and a&s;&s;aulted the garri&s;ons, but were not able to take them. Many other towns in this, and a neighbouring government, <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Alm&s;bury, Haverhill, York, Exeter, Dover, &amp;c.</NOTE> &s;uffered by the incur&s;ions of the &s;avages; and the country was in a perpetual alarm.</P>
<P>In 1705, I meet with no con&s;iderable deva&s;ta|tions of the enemy. As it was a time of war, the people on the frontiers mu&s;t have lived in con|tinual fear; and, if they ventured into their fields, it mu&s;t have been in great fear and jeapordy of their lives. But,</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="011130_0032_0F854E671CE5FEB8">In the beginning of the next year, 1706, &s;everal hundreds marched from Canada, to fall upon the frontiers of New-England. The intelligence of this de&s;ign gave a dreadful alarm, through all the fron|tiers the people not knowing where they would fall on. Probably the enemy divided their forces; for they fell on &s;everal places nearly at the &s;ame time. During the cour&s;e of this year, Dun&s;table, Sudbury, Chelmsford, Exeter, and divers other pla|ces, had &s;ome of their inhabitants killed, or taken; and a party ventured down to Reading, within a few miles of our metropolis.

<P>In 1708, the country was alarmed with advices, that the governor of Canada was collecting all the tribes of &s;avages he could, for a powerful inva&s;ion of &s;ome part of New-England, to be commanded by French officers. Providence &s;trangely di&s;con|certed their plan, and great numbers of Indians gave over the enterprize. However, on the 29th

<P>Nothwith&s;tanding <HI>this</HI> Colony had been harra&s;&s;ed with long and perplexing wars, yet, upon an inti|mation from the Crown, that an expedition was de&s;igned again&s;t Canada, they chearfully rai&s;ed and kept in pay, for &s;everal months, their quota of troops <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">Viz. 900 men.</NOTE> and tran&s;ports, until advices were re|ceived, that the intended expedition was laid a&s;ide. This was an additional di&s;appointment and misfor|tune to a people, already &s;inking under a load of debt. And, through the cour&s;e of this year, the ravages on the frontiers were continued; many places were attacked, on the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern frontiers. A large party of the enemy attacked Deerfield, when the inhabitants were ju&s;t returned from captivity&mdash;&s;everal other places had their in|habitants picked off, by parties of Indians, di&s;per&s;ed all over the frontiers.</P>

<P>Nothing further could be expected from an ex|hau&s;ted people, yet, perhaps encouraged by the &s;ucce&s;s of the preceeding year, and well knowing that they were never to expect any la&s;ting peace and &s;afety, &s;o long as Canada was in the hands of the French, upon advice of an expedition form|ing again&s;t Quebec, <HI>this</HI> Colony, with almo&s;t un|paraled readine&s;s and di&s;patch, furni&s;hed two regi|ments, their quota of troops, with provi&s;ions, and joined the king's troops arrived at Bo&s;ton, on the projected expedition. The whole armament, con|&s;i&s;ting of fifteen &s;ail of men of war, forty tran&s;ports and 7000 troops &s;ailed from Bo&s;ton, July 30, 1711. They arrived in the river St. Lawrence, where, in the night, eight or nine &s;hips were wrecked upon the rocks, and a thou&s;and of the king's troops peri&s;hed in the waves. This dreadful blow, at once, put an end to the expedition. The navy and regular troops returned to England, and the New-England forces returned a&s;hamed and confounded. The di&s;appointment and vexation was very great. The public debt was increa&s;ed, and become now al|mo&s;t in&s;upportable. The country was &s;till left to the mercile&s;s ravages of French &amp; Indians. Some pious minds give over all hopes of ever reducing Canada.

<P>Early on the &s;pring of the next year, 1712, the &s;avages renewed their a&s;&s;aults on the frontiers, kil|ling and captivating in one place and another.

<P>From the year 1713, the land had re&s;t and peace for about ten years. But, in 1723, the Indians broke out into a war (to which they were urged by the French) that la&s;ted about two years. During this war, the &s;avages harra&s;&s;ed the frontiers from ea&s;t to we&s;t; falling upon divers towns at the ea&s;t|ward, killing &amp; captivating many of the people.<NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">Scarborough, Falmouth, Berwick, Wells, Arundel, &amp;c.</NOTE> They al&s;o fell on the we&s;tern towns, particularly Rutland, where the mini&s;ter of the town <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">The Rev.

The Engli&s;h engaged the Indians in the Ea&s;t, with various &s;ucce&s;s, for &s;ome time, until their &s;ucce&s;s in de&s;troying the Indian &s;ettlements at Norridgewalk, with a great part of the tribe of that name, induced the &s;avages in ge|neral, to treat of peace, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed by a &s;olemn treaty in 1725. <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Commonly called Lieut.

<P>From the peace in 1725, the country enjoyed peace for nineteen years; viz. until the declaration of war between England and France, in 1744; when all our frontiers were involved in the dangers and perplexities of an Indian war.

<P>Two things are ob&s;ervable, in which the la&s;t war differed from all that New-England had been en|gaged in before.</P>

of the &s;everal governments became blended or con|nected together; they were obliged to join their forces, and the cau&s;e became a common one, al|though it mu&s;t be acknowledged that New-England, even then, bore the burden and heat of the day.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Whereas, in all preceeding wars, our ea&s;t|ern and we&s;tern frontiers were open to the ravages of the &s;avages, during the la&s;t war, as we acted on the offen&s;ive, and carried the war into the enemy's country, they were obliged to collect all their forces for their own defence, by which means our frontier &s;ettlements were unmole&s;ted: And, through the whole war, were, in a manner, &s;afe from fear; a quiet habitation&mdash;a happine&s;s they never enjoyed in any preceeding war with France.</P>
<P>The beginning of the la&s;t war was un&s;ucce&s;sful in America. General Braddock, at the head of two regiments, marching to remove the enemy's en|croachments on the Ohio, was attacked and &s;lain, and a dreadful &s;laughter was made of the troops under his command. In the latter end of the year, an army of French and Indians under General Die&s;kau, was defeated by the provincial troops, and the French inhabitants were, the &s;ame year, remov|ed from Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P>The next year (1756) our troops made an in|active campaign. Nothing of any great moment happened, only the lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h garri&s;on at O&s;wego, and with it all our communication with the great lakes, or inland &s;eas; which laid all the frontiers of America open to the incur&s;ions of the enemy.</P>

<P>The critical &s;tate of the American war, and the hazzard the Colonies were in of being lo&s;t, arou&s;ed the fear of the nation, and obliged Great-Britain to &s;end over a greater number of troops, with a powerful naval armament, to carry on the war in America.</P>
<P>The events of the year 1758, were, in general, pro&s;perous, though in &s;ome in&s;tances our enemies had the advantage. Loui&s;burg was inve&s;ted and taken, and the naval power of France was thereby greatly reduced. But the repul&s;e of our army be|fore Ticonderoga, with the lo&s;s of not le&s;s than 2000 men, the flower of the Briti&s;h troops, killed, wounded and mi&s;&s;ing, was a humbling &s;troke.&mdash; This defeat was in &s;ome mea&s;ure repaired, by the

<P>In 1759, our affairs began with the greate&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s. The Briti&s;h and Provincial troops were commanded by able Generals, and the &s;ucce&s;s was equal to rea&s;onable expectation. Many of you remember how our hearts leaped for joy, on the arrival of the frequent me&s;&s;engers of our &s;ucce&s;&s;es.

<P>The next year, 1760, is a glorious Aera for New-England, and all the American Colonies&mdash;an Aera our fathers longed to &s;ee. The enemy early made &s;ome feeble attempts to re&s;cue and &s;ave their coun|try,

but all in vain.&mdash;God, who of old led his people through the Red-&s;ea, on dry ground, and dryed up the waters of Jordan, conducted our ar|mies through the watry avenues of their country. He cau&s;ed the fear and dread of them to fall upon our enemies; all hearts were faint, and all hands were feeble. Upon the approach of the Briti&s;h troops, the whole country of Canada was &s;urren|dered to the Crown of Great-Britain, and the entire conque&s;t of the French in North-America was com|pleated.&mdash;The exten&s;ive countries, which the crown of France po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or claimed in North-America, which, in future ages, may contain many flouri&s;h|ing kingdoms, were, by the following treaty of peace, forever annexed to the Briti&s;h empire.

<P>The la&s;t war was more intere&s;ting and impor|tant than any, that had taken place in America: It was a contending for the empire, not of New-England only, but of all North-America. <HI>Our Fathers,</HI> long &s;ince, predicted &s;uch an important &s;truggle. The crown of France hurried it on, by a vigorous pur&s;uit of the plan laid near an hundred years ago, to &s;orround and &s;ubject to it&s;elf the Co|lonies of Great-Britain. Had the Briti&s;h &amp; French Colonies been left to contend with one another, it is highly probable the Engli&s;h, by rea&s;on of their

&s;uperior numbers, had carried the day. But, as France was continually pouring troops into her Colonies, and erecting impregnable fortre&s;&s;es in the mo&s;t advantageous places, <HI>we</HI> &s;tood in ab&s;olute need of powerful aids from the mother country. The lo&s;s of her Colonies mu&s;t have been of the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;equence to Great-Britain, powerful &s;uccours were therefore readily &s;ent over, not to &s;uper&s;ede, but to aid the utmo&s;t exertions of the Colonies. They did not take this occa&s;ion to with|draw them&s;elves from the burden of war, but, to their utmo&s;t, yea, &s;ome of them, "beyond their ability," exerted them&s;elves, from the beginning to the end of the war. For &s;everal years, it is &s;aid, a fifth part of the inhabitants of this province, fit to bear arms, were employed in the King's &s;ervice: And, if I mi&s;take not, <HI>this</HI> &s;ingle province had, one year, ten thou&s;and men employed in the &s;er|vice by &s;ea and land. Though I never could find that the number of the Coloni&s;ts that peri&s;hed in the la&s;t wars, was exactly a&s;certained, yet &s;everal thou&s;ands, from <HI>this</HI> country, mu&s;t have peri&s;hed, in &s;o many years &s;ervice; in &s;o many long marches, laborious and difficult &s;ieges, and &s;harp encounters; and the debt contracted in the cour&s;e of the war, notwith&s;tanding parliamentary grants, is <HI>&s;till</HI> a heavy burden upon the people of this province.</P>
<P>Since the Briti&s;h empire became unrivaled, in North-America, New-England hath been a quiet habitation. Our mo&s;t expo&s;ed villages, that have been for ages expo&s;ed to the barbarities of merci|le&s;s &s;avages, are now rejoycing in peace &amp; &s;afety&mdash; every one &s;its under his own vine and his own fig|tree, and there are none to make us afraid.

The <HI>Stamp-Act,</HI> which, had it operated in America, would have greatly ef|fected our liberty and property, was &s;oon declared to be quite uncon&s;titutional, in the face of that Par|liament, who, but one year before, had pa&s;&s;ed the act, <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Particularly by the&s;e great men, Earl Chatham and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> and was pre&s;ently repealed.

In&s;tead of royal donations, and parliamen|tary a&s;&s;i&s;tances, the truth of the matter is, that, for 120 years, we were not only de&s;titute of them, but in that time have met with many di&s;couragements from home to break the &s;pirit of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed infant Colony.

it is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the abettors of arbitrary power, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, have, all along, been the enemies of New-England.&mdash; Charles I. under the influence of Arch-bi&s;hop Laud, (who always kept a jealous eye over New-England, and had his emi&s;aries here, to make repre&s;entations of every thing that might &s;et the Colonies in a bad light) endeavoured to cramp their growth, and threatned the a&s;&s;umption of their priviledges. His &s;on, Charles II. li&s;tened to every one di&s;affected to our pro&s;perity, and begun the pro&s;ecution again&s;t the Charter.

Every war they waged bro't ruin, in the end, upon them&s;elves. Every year le&s;&s;ened their numbers; and even peace with us, and free intercour&s;e with our &s;ettlements: Yea, all our attempts to civilize and bring them to a regular life, have proved pernicious to them, in the end, and accelerated their de&s;truction.

<P>The &s;erious and con&s;cientious ob&s;ervation of the Lord's-day, is a duty of the highe&s;t importance to the life and power of religion among a people.

Only ca&s;t your eyes on tho&s;e places, where little regard is paid to the Lord's-day, and you will find them, in a &s;tate of ignorance, and immorality, little or nothing bet|ter than ab&s;olute heatheni&s;m.

Several e|minent mini&s;ters were, if I mi&s;take not, turned out of their livings for refu&s;ing to read, in the churches, a proclamation for &s;ports on the Lord's-day. Our fathers were in general very &s;trict and preci&s;e ob|&s;ervers of the Lord's-day They permitted no &s;ports or diver&s;ions, and, when they were not em|ployed in public wor&s;hip, they applied them&s;elves to offices of piety, &s;uch as reading, praying, cate|chi&s;ing, and &s;inging in their own hou&s;es. Some|thing, I hope, of this excellent &s;pirit &s;till remains, in this land. We have yet good laws enacted to prevent the prophanation of holy time: And, I hope, there are not wanting &s;ome, who have zeal and courage enough to put them into execution. But it is not to be doubted that, through the coun|try, in general, a &s;erious regard to the Lord's-day is on the decline. Under a notion of laying a&s;ide the preci&s;ene&s;s, or, as &s;ome call it, the &s;cupo|lo&s;ity of our ance&s;tors, I fear, we are falling into the quite contrary extream. Not only worldly di&s;cour&s;es, but even vi&s;iting, and riding from town to town, and walking for diver&s;ion, are becoming common among us. But let me call upon you, my dear friends and neighbours, to awaken your zeal for the preci&s;e ob&s;ervation of the Lord's-day. Not only let us &s;tatedly frequent the public wor|&s;hip of Chri&s;t, but let us carry our regards for holy time into private. In&s;tead of worldly di&s;cour&s;es, needle&s;s vi&s;iting, or diver&s;ions of any kind, let us improve this day at home, in prayers and devoti|ons. Let us keep our families in due &s;ubjection,

re&s;train them from all levity and diver&s;ion, and bring them up in a &s;erious and reverend regard for holy time. Let us permit no idle company in our hou&s;es, and &s;teadily di&s;courage and frown on every thing that tends to abate the reverence and re&s;pect people ought to have for the &s;abbath. We cannot but be grieved for that prophanation of holy time, which comes under our ob&s;ervation: If we have increa&s;ing examples of this, let them not abate our &s;erious regard to our duty. Otherwi&s;e we &s;hall offend God, bring on a &s;ad decay of real religion, and ruin our po&s;terity.&mdash;While I recommend the ob&s;ervation of the Lord's-day, I plead for that reli|gion, which is our life, and by which we &s;hall pro|long our days in the land which the Lord our God has given us.</P>
<P>Another thing, which the pre&s;ent moral &s;tate of the country leads me to recommend to &s;erious con|&s;ideration, is an attendance on the Lord's &s;upper. The Lord's &s;upper, as it is an expre&s;s and plain, &s;o it is an important and u&s;eful in&s;titution of the redeemer. I am grieved to find there is &s;uch a general neglect of it in this land. Many churches are awfully reduced in their numbers, and, in &s;ome places, the neglect is become fa&s;hionable and almo&s;t univer&s;al. Such great numbers ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the Communion that it is become in a manner reputable to live and die in this &s;ad and dangerous neglect. The common di&s;regard to this in&s;titution of Chri&s;t is, I am verily per&s;uaded, one of the cry|ing &s;ins of this people, and an a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tance of the want of love to Chri&s;t, the life and pow|er of chri&s;tianity.&mdash;It is an evidence how little per&s;ons are concerned to be &s;aved.

&s;ome real chri&s;tians may ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the communion, through real fears &amp; &s;cruples. Many things have been injudiciou&s;ly &s;aid in pa&s;t ages, which may cau&s;e an unrea&s;onable dread and fear of coming to the Lord's table. Prejudices are not ea&s;ily eradiated from mens minds. But, I confe&s;s, I have not that exten&s;ive charity as to &s;uppo&s;e but that, by far, the greater part of tho&s;e, that live in the neglect of the Lord's &s;upper, do &s;o from a low e&s;teem for this ordinance of Chri&s;t, or becau&s;e they are afraid, that by &s;o &s;olemn a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity, they &s;hall bring them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of a more circum&s;pect life, or di&s;honour them&s;elves by contradicting, in practice, their own profe&s;&s;ion. After all that can ju&s;tly be &s;aid in excu&s;e for this general omi&s;&s;ion, it argues at lea&s;t, a prevailing infidelity of heart, a coldne&s;s in religion, an awful want of regard to Chri&s;t, and a dreadful unconcernedne&s;s as to the mercy of God in another world. Our fathers, perhaps to avoid the other extream, made the terms of chri&s;tian communion too &s;trait and narrow, which might be offen&s;ive and di&s;couraging to &s;ome; but, in mo&s;t of our churches, there is a more liberal &s;pirit, and nothing is required, as a term of communion, that any &s;erious well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;on &s;hould &s;cruple to comply with. Oh that baptized per&s;ons; that profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians would think of this great duty! Oh! that all, who love the Lord Je&s;us, would, in their &s;everal places, do all they can to wipe away the reproach that is ca&s;t on the precious redeemer of &s;ouls, and the in&s;titution, by which his di&s;ciples are to be peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hed from all mankind. Let tho&s;e who love Chri&s;t be earne&s;t in prayer, that God would pour out his Spirit; then &s;hall we &s;ee

men and women flying, as the clouds, and as the doves to their windows, to this precious ordinance of the redeemer.</P>
<P>Suffer me al&s;o to tell you, that the great increa&s;e of profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing in the land does greatly provoke God, and cau&s;e the hearts of good men to mourn. This country was once remark|able for its regard to the name of God. Cur&s;ing and &s;wearing were once rare, and accounted very di&s;honourable; and, when known, &s;everely pun|i&s;hed by civil authority. I have heard of a man that lived &s;ome time in New-England, who upon his return to Old-England, declared, he had lived <HI>&s;even</HI> years in a country, and all that time had never &s;een any one drunk, nor heard a profane oath. But, alas! the times are &s;adly changed, and that, as far as I can ob&s;erve, not only in populous places, but in country villages, and through the country in general. This has been a growing vice for many years: But the late wars, wherein &s;uch great num|bers of our young men were employed in the army, have dreadfully corrupted our morals, and &s;pread &s;uch profane&s;s as was never known in the country before. And our pre&s;ent di&s;agreable circum&s;tances are, I fear, every day increa&s;ing profane&s;s in the mid&s;t of us. What multitudes are found who fear not to cur&s;e and &s;wear, and take the awful name of God into their mouths, on every occa&s;ion, in their common conver&s;ation? It is impo&s;&s;ible to walk the &s;treets, in populous places, and not be o|bliged to hear horrid oaths &amp; imprecations. How many children, almo&s;t as &s;oon as they can &s;peak, learn to &s;wear? Good men, I fear, look with too little di&s;plea&s;ure on this &s;in. Children are not
<PB N="59" REF="011130_0057_0F854E7C393343C8">
watched and warned again&s;t and puni&s;hed for this &s;in, as they ought to be. How &s;eldom are the good laws again&s;t cur&s;ing &amp; &s;wearing, put in execution? In &s;hort, it is, with many, no blot in a man's cha|racter, to cur&s;e and &s;wear: Men that are profane, (I might &s;ay ob&s;cene too) notwith&s;tanding pa&s;s, with many, for very good kind of men. This in|crea&s;e of profane&s;s, calls for humiliation: It calls for the united endeavours of mini&s;ters and magi|&s;trates, and all who regard the intere&s;t of that re|ligion which is the life of any people. This matter particularly calls for your &s;erious attention, who live in a place of &s;o much concour&s;e and bu&s;ine&s;s. You cannot be too watchful over your children, nor too careful to keep them out of the way of temptation.</P>
<P>The &s;pread of intemperance, and the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, the&s;e late years, calls for the &s;erious con&s;ideration of all that regard the vir|tue and welfare of their country. The fir&s;t inha|bitants of this country, were remarkable for their temperance; but alas, how is the gold become dim, and the mo&s;t fine gold changed? Little u&s;e was, for a long time, made of &s;pirituous liquors, unle&s;s for a medicine&mdash;for common refre&s;hment they were &s;eldom or never taken. But our trade with the We&s;t-india I&s;lands, has abundantly fur|ni&s;hed us with the means of intemperance. The great plenty of &s;pirituous liquors hath proved a temptation too hard for many to with&s;tand, and truly threatens the de&s;truction of thou&s;ands of our inhabitants. That which once only &s;erved for pe|culiar occa&s;ions, is now become the common drink of a great part of our labouring people. Many
<PB N="60" REF="011130_0058_0F854E7CDF8974B0">
have &s;o habituated them&s;elves to &s;trong drink, that they will perform no &s;ervice without the liberal u&s;e of it. Only con&s;ider, my Brethren, how many, by the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong drink, become &s;tupid, idle, poor hu&s;bands; &s;quander away their &s;ub|&s;tance; wa&s;ting what they earn, or laying out &s;o great a part that they are poor and mi&s;erable. How many poor people lay out almo&s;t all they earn for Rum, and therefore when any di&s;a&s;ter befals them, they become a charge and burden to their neigh|bours, and the community. Many &s;pend their e&s;tates, and bring their families to poverty. How many young men, who, in early life, bid fair to be u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, are debauched and &s;poil|ed by exce&s;&s;ive drinking! How many break and enfeeble their con&s;titutions, and die before their time, by this accur&s;ed vice! Truly, my hearers, I am warm when I &s;peak of the&s;e things, and I can|not be otherwi&s;e. I tremble to think what mi&s;chiefs this &s;ingle vice is bringing on this, that otherwi&s;e might be, the happie&s;t people in the world. There is &s;carce any thing I can hear of a friend, neigh|bour, or acquaintance, &s;o &s;hocking to me, as that he indulges the common and liberal u&s;e of &s;trong drink. When once the appetite gets the rule; when once &s;pirituous liquors become nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pe|cially to the carrying on bu&s;ine&s;s, I almo&s;t &s;et that down as a gone, a ruined man: It defeats every com|fortable hope. Oh my friends, my dear country|men, this growing, this pe&s;tilential evil, calls for &s;ome &s;peedy and effectual remedy. It calls for the united oppo&s;ition of magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters, &s;ober hou&s;holders; and of all that wi&s;h well to the pro&s;peri|ty of their country. Let us ari&s;e, and, in our &s;everal places, make an effectual &s;tand, or we are a poor

mi&s;erable en&s;laved people. Don't you &s;ee the de|&s;tructive effects of this exce&s;s? Oh bani&s;h it from your families.&mdash;Let me earne&s;tly enjoyn it on the ri&s;ing generation, who have kept them&s;elves free from the power of vicious appetites, never to be brought into bondage. As for &s;uch as have u&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;trong drink, at their labour e&s;pecially, and plead up for it, one had near as good rea&s;on with the wind, or bid the &s;un not &s;hine, as pretend to turn them from what they dearly love. But as for you that are yet free from this folly, there is hope you will take warning. Don't you &s;ee the pernicious con&s;equences of this vice; it is at your peril; your amazing peril, at the peril of your health, character, pro&s;perity; yea at the peril of your everla&s;ting &s;alvation, that you make the common and daily u&s;e of &s;trong li|quors, in any way, nece&s;&s;ary unto you.</P>
<P>I have often and earne&s;tly recommended indu&s;try and frugality, as virtues ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pub|lic happine&s;s: And I would again recommend to your &s;erious con&s;ideration, what I have &s;aid upon that intere&s;ting &s;ubject. It is the happine&s;s of New-England that property is more equally divided than in any other part of the world; and, I believe, the poor have advantages for acquiring a comfor|table &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and, even, for laying up e&s;tates, beyond almo&s;t any country what&s;oever. But with|out indu&s;try and frugality, no people in the world can flouri&s;h. If families live in idlene&s;s, if people go beyond their abilities in living, building, dre&s;s, equipage, and the like; if children are not care|fully brought up to indu&s;try, there is no doubt they will be mi&s;erable, with the greate&s;t and be&s;t ad|vantages.
<PB N="62" REF="011130_0060_0F854E7E6C975050">
It is therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary, if con|&s;idered only as the means of pre&s;ent public hap|pine&s;s, that children be trained up to u&s;eful bu&s;i|ne&s;s that we retrench &s;uperfluities, that we content our &s;elves with the effects of our own indu&s;try.&mdash; The&s;e things I urge, not merely or chiefly as being at this time peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary for an&s;wering po|litical purpo&s;es in Great-Britain, but as now and always nece&s;&s;ary to the life and pro&s;perity of a people. Once more,</P>
<P>Family government was very &s;trict, in the fir&s;t ages of the country. But, if our fathers, in any in&s;tances, carried the matter too far <HI>then,</HI> we are certainly gone very far into the other extream <HI>now.</HI> Family government, through the country, is gene|rally too much relaxed. The reverence and obe|dience of children to their parents, is too much le&s;&s;ened. Too little re&s;traint is laid on youth, which, left to it &s;elf, is vanity. Family prayer is in many places mo&s;t awfully neglected: The con|&s;equence is, as might be expected, youth are loo&s;e, profane, untractable and unadvi&s;ed. This want of family government is &s;een in &s;chools and colleges, and is ju&s;tly lamented by per&s;ons of the be&s;t judg|ment and ob&s;ervation. Families are the nur&s;eries of virtue and happine&s;s, and the laying a&s;ide family religion, is &s;triking a blow at the root. It is high time for us to think of this matter. Let us all, this day, take up Jo&s;hua's excellent re&s;olution;&mdash; "but as for me and my hou&s;e we will &s;erve the Lord." <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;hua 4.15.</NOTE> Let us make our hou&s;es Bethels for prayer&mdash;let us keep up the authority of parents and ma&s;ters&mdash;let us lay our re&s;traints on youth, when

they would make them&s;elves vile, for a child, left to him&s;elf, bringeth his father to &s;hame. Oh! if we love our families, if we tender their pre&s;ent happine&s;s or eternal life: If we regard po&s;terity, let us attend to the important work of family re|ligion and government. This is a matter that re|quires wi&s;dom and prudence; by too much &s;eve|rity and &s;trictne&s;s, I know, it is po&s;&s;ible children may be di&s;couraged, but, generally &s;peaking, there is greater, far greater danger, that they will be in|jured and ruined by too much indulgance.</P>
<P>I might go on to mention other things implied in walking before God, and clo&s;ely connected with the public weal. It is a maxim founded on the experience of all ages,
<Q>righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, but &s;in is a reproach to any people.</Q><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Prov. 14.24.</NOTE> But the time calls upon me to fini&s;h my di&s;|cour&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>Innumerable motives and arguments I could al|&s;o &s;et before you, to per&s;wade you to walk before the God of your fathers, taken from the con&s;ide|ration of dome&s;tic and public happine&s;s; from this world, and the world to come.&mdash;This is our life&mdash; but here I am &s;traitned by the want of time&mdash;only let me &s;ugge&s;t a few thoughts.</P>
<P>The con&s;ideration of the noble de&s;ign of plant|ing this country, and of the excellent characters of its fir&s;t inhabitants &s;hould animate us to walk be|fore God, and maintain a religious character. The views on which this land was &s;ettled were &s;ingular and noble: It was not trade and commerce, nor
<PB N="64" REF="011130_0062_0F854E7FDD33E808">
any worldly views, but religion was the noble motive that brought our fathers hither, and recon|ciled them to the perils of their wilderne&s;s &s;tate. They planted them&s;elves <HI>here</HI> with the real ex|pre&s;s views of &s;erving God, and of training up their po&s;terity in the good ways of the Lord. They were indeed, in general a very &s;erious oon&s;ciencious &s;et of people. In &s;ome things they appear to us, at this day, to have been narrow in their principles, but, if we reflect, we &s;hall find nothing &s;ingular in them on that account. The age they lived in was dark, compared with ours. The church had but lately emerged from popi&s;h darkne&s;s, and all &s;ects of chri&s;tians retained &s;omething of the old leaven, the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of popery; and it is no wonder our fathers had a tincture of it. Time and enquiry, experience and ob&s;ervation for more than an hundred years have increa&s;ed the light, and taught the more &s;en&s;ible part of chri&s;tians moderation, candor and forbear|ance. With all their mi&s;takes, our ance&s;tors retain the character of &s;ingular exemplary chri&s;tians; and, would to God, we had more of their excellent &s;pi|rit. Let us con&s;ider from whence we are fallen and repent, that though we have &s;uperior light we have lo&s;t much of that &s;erious devout heavenly &s;pi|rit, which &s;o happily di&s;tingui&s;hed them. Let us &s;trive to recover and retain primitive piety. Let us keep in view the gracious end which they pur|&s;ued. May we never wholly lo&s;e that religious character for which this land has &s;o long been re|markable. May we guard again&s;t every tempta|tion to depart from the good way, our fathers walked in. Let us cleave to God and one ano|ther in love, that we may be unto him for a name
<PB N="65" REF="011130_0063_0F854E80A96EF6D0">
and for a prai&s;e and for a glory, above any other people on the earth.</P>
<P>Should not love to God and gratitude to him, that has done &s;uch marvellous things for us, engage us to &s;erve him in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s? How can we trace the paths of providence, from age to age working for us, and not feel the goodne&s;s of God leading us to repentance! Can we ill requite the Lord&mdash;can we be evil and unthankful?</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider our dependance on God for future pro&s;perity. We have had an awful example of God's &s;everity in rooting out whole nations to make room for us. He cau&s;ed them to melt away as the dew before the ri&s;ing &s;un: Their name and memo|rial is, in a manner, peri&s;hed out of the earth. Hath not God the &s;ame power over us? If we for&s;ake him and &s;erve other gods, or &s;erve divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, divine providence will ca&s;t us out of its protection, we &s;hall &s;ink under the weight of our own &s;ins, as multitudes of antient kingdoms and nations have done; we &s;hall peri&s;h from off the earth, and from under the&s;e heavens. God has judgments enough in &s;tore&mdash;Fear as-well as love ought to engage us to &s;erve God. Corruption and immorality are the natural, nece&s;&s;ary ruin of a peo|ple, and hi&s;tory pre&s;ents us with &s;triking examples of nations that have &s;unk under the weight of their own vices.&mdash;A people can never be free and happy but in proportion as they are virtuous&mdash;vice is &s;lavery, mi&s;ery and certain ruin.</P>
<P>Finally: Let us all &s;eriou&s;ly lay to heart our probationary &s;tate, and the amazing eternity into which we are going. The retro&s;pect upon former
<PB N="66" REF="011130_0064_0F854E815DD5E0E0">
ages, gives us a &s;triking, an affecting idea of the changing &s;tate of man. "One generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and another cometh." "Our fathers" that laid the foundation of our pre&s;ent happine&s;s, who&s;e names are had in re&s;pected remembrance, "where are they"? They have fini&s;hed their weari&s;ome pilgrimage, made their bed in the du&s;t, and their &s;epulchres are with us to this day. As all our fathers, we are but &s;trangers and &s;ojourners in this land. <HI>This</HI> century will hou&s;e, by far, the greate&s;t part of this a&s;&s;embly in the du&s;t.&mdash;May divine grace enable us to act our part well on the &s;tage of life, and, when we are taken out of this wilderne&s;s to Canaan above, may we leave this fair inheritance to our children, and they to theirs.
<Q>As for man, his days are as gra&s;s, as a flower of the field, &s;o it flouri&s;heth, for the wind pa&s;&s;eth over it and it is gone, and the place thereof &s;hall know it no more. But the mercy of the Lord is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting upon them that fear him, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s to childrens children; to &s;uch as keep his covenant, and that remember his commandments to do them.</Q> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 103.15,&mdash;18.</NOTE></P>
