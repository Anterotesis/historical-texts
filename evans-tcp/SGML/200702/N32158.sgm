<HEAD>CALM and RESPECTFUL THOUGHTS on the NEGATIVE of the CROWN on a SPEAKER cho&s;en and pre&s;ented by the REPRE|SENTATIVES of the PEOPLE: Occa&s;ioned by &s;ome PUBLICATIONS in the GEORGIA GAZETTE, of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June</HI> 1772, wherein the late ASSEMBLY of that PROVINCE is charged with encroaching on the RIGHTS of the CROWN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">BY A FREEMAN. <HI>Pro Rege &amp; Patria &s;emper.</HI> Buckingham's Epitaph.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a remark of a very con&s;iderable writer of our own, "<HI>that it cannot be improper to canva&s;s any con&s;titutional que&s;tion when decency is ob&s;erved and nothing advanced but on the credit of the be&s;t authorities,</HI> becau&s;e in a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> country every man ought to be ac|quainted with the laws by which his liberty and property are in&s;ured." Under the &s;helter of this ob&s;ervation &s;ome remarks have been ventured abroad, which I humbly apprehend have been rather condemned with &s;everity, and replied to with per&s;onal reflections, than canva&s;&s;ed or an&s;wered with calmne&s;s or &s;trength of ar|gument. As the &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ever has been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">dly dropt by one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not now take pen in hand could the other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">een &s;atisfied to enjoy his victory, without continuing to load the late A&s;&s;embly with reflections, which I will not &s;ay are de&s;igned, but appear to have a tendency to &s;et this province in the wor&s;t light at home, and to render the late Repre&s;enta+tives as odious as po&s;&s;ible in this province. My de&s;ign
<PB N="2" REF="042393_0002_101BD88E769386F0">
is to take off the odium which is ca&s;t upon this pro|vince as though it meant to invade the Prerogative of the Crown. If the late Repre&s;entatives have acted contrary to the &s;en&s;e of their Con&s;tituents they will doubtle&s;s be marked for it at a next election; if the majority of inhabitants &s;hould think the Crown has not a right of rejection, let their arguments be fir&s;t con&s;i|dered before they are accu&s;ed of a de&s;ign of encroaching on the Prerogative.</P>
<P>I will own my obligations; the mo&s;t li<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> I received in this controver&s;y has been from that very writer, and, upon the mo&s;t mature con&s;ideration, I mu&s;t own the right he contends for appears to me more problematical than ever. I will however &s;till leave this right as I found it (I always wi&s;hed it &s;hould remain unagitated) undetermined and undecided; but I hope I am not too &s;anguine to flatter my&s;elf that tho&s;e that read what may make again&s;t it will be convinced they that hold the ne|gative may &s;till be hone&s;t men, and good and loyal &s;ubjects, whether in a private character, or as the Re|pre&s;entatives of a free and loyal people. I de&s;ign to mention &s;ome arguments which per&s;uade me this nega|tive is not clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and I &s;hall take &s;o much notice of the arguments brought in &s;upport of it to ex|amine whether they really prove what is intended.</P>
<P>It may not be improper fir&s;t to lay down a few ge|neral principles which are univer&s;ally allowed. It is agreed on all &s;ides that the exi&s;tence of a Hou&s;e of Com|mons is now as nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential to our Con&s;titu|tion as the exi&s;tence of a King and Hou&s;e of Lords. It is agreed that the Commons being the Repre&s;entatives of the people the people ought to chu&s;e them, the King and Lords mu&s;t not interfere in the choice, and any one duly cho&s;en, and not by law incapacitated, the election ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> be &s;et a&s;ide. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">eed that the Crown mu&s;t call the Hou&s;e, i&s;&s;ue <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ction, and may adjourn, prorogue, or di&s;&s;olve the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, but to reign without Parliament is contrary to the Con&s;titution; to di&s;&s;olve wantonly, and without cau&s;e, is not again&s;t the Con&s;ti|tution, but it &s;eems an improper u&s;e of a very legal power. The de&s;ign of a Hou&s;e of Commons is to be a check on the Prerogative, and to watch over the rights of the people. Prerogative is placed in the
<PB N="3" REF="042393_0003_101BD8900082D818">
Crown that the people may not encroach on the rights of the Crown. By the wi&s;dom of the Con&s;titution every branch of the Legi&s;lature forms a mutual check upon the other, the people are a check upon the Nobility, and the Nobility upon the people, while the King is a check upon both, and his executive power is again checked and kept within due bounds by the two Hou|&s;es, through the privilege they have of enquiring into, impeaching, and puni&s;hing the conduct of the King's evil Coun&s;ellors. The Hou&s;e of Commons is to con&s;ult for the good of the nation, and all monies given to the King are given only by the Commons; whatever is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e is their undeniable privilege, for, unle&s;s they may freely con&s;ult, and do that for which they are called together and con&s;tituted a Hou&s;e, the very purpo&s;es of their meeting mu&s;t be defeated. I &s;uppo&s;e therefore it will not be denied, as the Crown calls the Commons together for national purpo&s;es, the Commons &s;o met mu&s;t have a right or privilege to every thing that appears nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es for which they are called and met together. This I take the true idea of the privileges of the Hou&s;e, and as the Hou&s;e cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t nor act properly without them, to deny or curtail the&s;e privileges is attempting the a|bolition of the Hou&s;e it&s;elf, and of cour&s;e de&s;troying the Con&s;titution. The faire&s;t way therefore to judge of any claim of either branch of the Legi&s;lature is to con|&s;ider the effect it may have on the other branches, and whatever cla&s;heth with any known right or privi|lege of either King or any of the two Hou&s;es cannot be con&s;titutional, whatever would prevent the Crown in the execution of tho&s;e laws made by the Legi&s;lative cannot be &s;upported, and if the Crown has any power that may re&s;train freedom of debate, or abridge the li|berty of giving and granting in the Hou&s;e of Commons, or impede them in bu&s;ine&s;s, otherwi&s;e than by adjourn|ment, prorogation, or di&s;&s;olution, I cannot &s;ee how the Hou&s;e may be conceived free and independent in their deliberations.</P>
<P>I believe few men will deny any of the&s;e principles; let them be kept in con&s;tant view when we enquire into the que&s;tion whether the Crown has a right to reject a Speaker duly cho&s;en and pre&s;ented for approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="042393_0004_101BD8919898EFA0"><HI>The Hou&s;e of Commons mu&s;t have a Speaker.</HI> All A&s;&s;em|blies met for con&s;ultation have found it nece&s;&s;ary to place one over them&s;elves to keep up order and regulate their debates; if 500 men were all to &s;peak at once, and none have authority to call them to order, the voice of wi&s;dom mu&s;t be lo&s;t in noi&s;e, and prudent coun&s;el &s;wallowed up in confu&s;ion. Formerly both Hou&s;es are &s;aid to have had but one Speaker between them, but as both Hou&s;es became more di&s;tinct, and the Commons more important, they of cour&s;e had a Speaker of their own, who is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that ordinarily they do no bu|&s;ine&s;s without him.</P>
<P><HI>This Speaker they mu&s;t either chu&s;e them&s;elves, or he mu&s;t be placed over them by the Crown.</HI> "The Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Lords is the Lord Chancellor or Keeper of the Great Seal, or <HI>any other APPOINTED BY THE KING's COMMISSION</HI>; and if none be &s;o appointed, the Hou&s;e of Lords (it is &s;aid) may elect;" <HI>Black&s;tone, vol.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 181. The Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons is cho&s;en by the Hou&s;e, but mu&s;t be approved of by the King, <HI>ibid.</HI> "It is true the Commons are to chu&s;e their Speaker," <HI>Coke.</HI> How far the King's approbation is nece&s;&s;ary is the que&s;tion in di&s;pute, but all agree that the Commons mu&s;t chu&s;e their Speaker, and it &s;eems the choice is of more importance than pre&s;entation or approbation, becau&s;e without choice there can be no &s;uch thing as either.</P>
<P><HI>The Speaker cho&s;en ought to be a per&s;on properly qualified.</HI> If every Member of Parliament ought to be indepen|dent and uninfluenced by any views of honour or inte|re&s;t but the publick good, the Speaker ought to be &s;o much more. He ought to be equally well acquainted with the privileges of the Hou&s;e and the rights of Pre|rogative, and of &s;ufficient fortitude to act con&s;i&s;tent with both on every occa&s;ion, neither courting popularity by di&s;puting the ju&s;t rights of the Crown, nor have an eye to gain or promotion by betraying any right of the &s;ubject. <HI>The election of any Member to be Speaker is a &s;o|lemn declaration of the Hou&s;e that they judge him the man be&s;t qualified for that bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> I believe it &s;eldom, if ever, happened, that a Member was cho&s;en Speaker the fir&s;t time of his &s;erving as a Member. A per&s;on is u&s;ually pitched upon who, from long experience, is well ac|quainted
<PB N="5" REF="042393_0005_101BD8975D0E00E8">
with the privileges and proceedings of the Hou&s;e, and of who&s;e abilities al&s;o the Hou&s;e have had long and &s;ufficient experience. The Speaker has been called a &s;ervant of the Hou&s;e, and as the King has an undoubted right to chu&s;e, and mu&s;t be the be&s;t judge of his own &s;ervants, &s;o the Commons are be&s;t acquainted with the character of every Member of their Hou&s;e, and thereby be&s;t able to judge who is the fitte&s;t for any particular bu&s;ine&s;s that may be a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P><HI>The Speaker &s;its in the Hou&s;e, not in the name or as a Commi&s;&s;ioner of the King, but</HI> (though his &s;eat is a little rai&s;ed) <HI>as a Member upon a par with the re&s;t,</HI> cho&s;en and appointed by them&s;elves; not to do any bu&s;ine&s;s for the King, but their bu&s;ine&s;s, to be their mouth, regulate their debates, and execute their orders; neither is he to have "<HI>eyes to &s;ee, or ears to hear, but as directed by the Hou&s;e.</HI>"</P>
<P><HI>It is not denied by any that the Commons mu&s;t chu&s;e, nor that their choice ought to be free,</HI> and it has been allowed that they are not obliged to chu&s;e a per&s;on nominated or re|commended by the Crown, &s;uppo&s;ing the Crown &s;hould think proper to recommend or make &s;uch a nomination, but as it has always been cu&s;tomary to pre&s;ent the Spea|ker &s;o cho&s;en to the King for approbation, it is hence concluded that the King may &s;et a&s;ide the choice of his Commons, and reject a Speaker &s;o pre&s;ented. If the want of &s;uch a right of rejection had any apparent ten|dency to render &s;ome other ab&s;olute rights of the King more precarious, or to endanger his Crown or the Con|&s;titution, the King ought undoubtedly to have it, for he ought to have his right, and every thing that may legally &s;ecure it; if the exerci&s;e of that right, though not nece&s;&s;ary to the King, might add to his greater dig|nity, and in no ca&s;e whatever bring any danger to the &s;ubject, I would in mere decency make a compliment of it to the King; but if it &s;hould appear that the claim and exerci&s;e of that right had even a di&s;tant tendency to hurt the &s;ubject, and wound the Con&s;titution, I would then wi&s;h that the King had and in&s;i&s;ted to have all the ju&s;t rights of his Royal Prerogative, and no more.</P>
<P>That I may treat the que&s;tion in the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive manner, I declare that I mean not to write again&s;t the right claimed by the Crown; I only propo&s;e &s;ome doubts
<PB N="6" REF="042393_0006_101BD898E13D0498">
which I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee cleared up, and with plea|&s;ure will I join all my fellow loyal &s;ubjects to acquie&s;ce in any claim that may appear the con&s;titutional right of the Crown.</P>
<P>AS it is agreed on all hands the Commons mu&s;t chu&s;e their Speaker, in the very nature of things it &s;eems im|plied that he whom they cho&s;e ought to be con&s;idered as Speaker. Whom are they to chu&s;e? A Speaker. By who&s;e authority are they to chu&s;e him? By the King's command, and as the Repre&s;entatives of the people; if, after having thus received the King's com|mand, and &s;itting as the Repre&s;entatives of the people, they have cho&s;en a man to be Speaker, the per&s;on &s;o cho&s;en is not what they cho&s;e him, it will be equally difficult to a&s;&s;ert what it &s;eems ju&s;t as difficult to deny, that they made a choice, or that they had not authority to make the choice they actually have made.</P>
<P>It has been allowed "that the Commons may freely chu&s;e whom they plea&s;e for their Speaker, but a&s;&s;erted, "that the Crown, for its own pre&s;ervation, has a right to reject an improper per&s;on, (<HI>Georgia Gazette, June</HI> 10.) By an improper per&s;on here mu&s;t be under&s;tood one whom the Commons thought proper, but who is thought improper by the Crown. Now let any one a&s;k him&s;elf whether he &s;hould think he enjoyed the right of freely chu&s;ing whom&s;oever he plea&s;ed for his own &s;ervant if another had the right to put a negative on the &s;ervant he had actually cho&s;en, under pretence of being im|proper for the &s;ervice of him by whom cho&s;en, and thereby deprive him of his &s;ervice at plea&s;ure. To talk of a free choice, which yet may be controuled and annulled by another, &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with the very nature of choice, and at mo&s;t it can only be called a freedom to chu&s;e upon condition that another do not invalidate the choice; if the per&s;on cho&s;en be equally acceptable to him that chu&s;es and to him that mu&s;t ap|prove, it matters very little by whom &s;uch a choice is made; but if acceptable and nece&s;&s;ary only to tho&s;e by whom the choice was made, I cannot &s;ee what their choice avails if it may be &s;et a&s;ide at plea&s;ure by another, perhaps too it might be &s;et a&s;ide for that very rea&s;on becau&s;e the per&s;on cho&s;en is &s;u&s;pected of being more in the intere&s;t of tho&s;e by whom he is cho&s;en than may be
<PB N="7" REF="042393_0007_101BD89BD24F9F40">
con&s;i&s;tent with the de&s;igns of him by whom he is re|jected.</P>
<P>The&s;e that chu&s;e a Speaker to do the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e have fir&s;t been cho&s;en them&s;elves to do the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the nation; they are not met by their own au|thority, nor to do their own bu&s;ine&s;s, nor the King's bu&s;ine&s;s, but the bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation; they cannot debate the concerns of the nation without a Speaker to direct and regulate their debates; but it is of infinite concern to the nation that no man mi&s;lead, re&s;train, or impede their debates; a Speaker might do all this, and were he to do it to &s;erve the Crown, it would be in vain to look to the Crown for relief, he would be a dead weight to them, and they unable to help them|&s;elves; it &s;eems therefore that the choice of a Speaker by the Repre&s;entatives &s;hould be as free and final as the choice of the people of the Repre&s;entatives who are to chu&s;e the Speaker.</P>
<P>The &s;itting of the Commons, though called by the King's writ; the privileges of the Hou&s;e, though prayed for of the King; the freedom of debate; are all matter of right, and not of favour; the very de&s;ign of the Hou&s;e of Commons is to prevent too exten&s;ive or an undue influence of the Crown; if any proceedings of the Hou&s;e become matters of favour of the Crown, what becomes of the intrin&s;ick right and authority of the Commons? A Speaker was excepted again&s;t, becau&s;e, "if the King always &s;hould accept a per&s;on pitched upon by the Hou&s;e, then it would be no great favour to be cho&s;en a Speaker." Here the exception again&s;t a Speaker was however &s;weetened with a rea&s;on being given; but if the Speaker holds his place, not by the choice of the Repre&s;entatives, but by the favour of the Crown, it is then evident that the principal man in the Hou&s;e of Commons holds his place under the favour and influence of that very power to prevent who&s;e too powerful influence, and re&s;train it within its proper bounds, is, or ought to be, the principal object of the Repre&s;entatives of a free people.</P>
<P><Q>The whole of the law and cu&s;tom of Parliament has its original from this one maxim, that whatever matter ari&s;es concerning either Hou&s;e of Parliament ought to be examined, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and adjudged, in
<PB N="8" REF="042393_0008_101BD89ED5D4D248">
that Hou&s;e to which it relates, and not el&s;ewhere,</Q>
<HI>Black&s;tone Com.</HI> 1.163. In con&s;equence of this the Commons may judge void the elections of Members al|ready &s;itting, and declare tho&s;e duly elected, who have not been returned &s;o by the proper Officer; and it would &s;eem &s;trange if they, who have a right to judge of every election in the kingdom, &s;hould not have a right to chu&s;e their own Speaker, if they were judges who is properly elected a Repre&s;entative of the whole nation, and yet liable to have a negative put on a choice made by them|&s;elves of their own &s;ervant. The Hou&s;e of Commons have an undoubted right by their own act, and without any concurrence or interfering of the Crown, to expell any of their Members, the Speaker not excepted, for mi&s;behaviour, the rea&s;on of which &s;eems to be, as the Crown is not &s;uppo&s;ed to interfere in elections, neither ought it in expul&s;ions; but if the Speaker holds his place by the King's favour and approbation, &s;o as without that he is not Speaker "<HI>pleno jure,</HI>" it would &s;eem &s;trange that the Commons &s;hould have a right to drive a man by their &s;ole authority from a po&s;t where they ne|ver could have placed him without the King's command and favour. To depo&s;e a man from a po&s;t which he could not hold, nor be cho&s;en to, but with the King's approbation, &s;eems to be a greater power than to chu&s;e their Officer without, the King's approbation.</P>
<P>If the King has a right to reject a Speaker cho&s;en, he mu&s;t hold that right either in virtue of &s;ome act of Par|liament, or it mu&s;t be a part of his Royal Prerogative; the former was never a&s;&s;erted, the latter is the &s;ubject in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;uppo&s;ition the King had a clear con&s;titutional right to nominate, or even impo&s;e a Speaker, as &s;oon as the Hou&s;e meets, that right &s;eems clearly given up, by his ordering or giving the Hou&s;e leave to chu&s;e a Speaker them&s;elves. As it is &s;aid even the Lords may elect, unle&s;s the King appoints a Speaker for them, it &s;eems clearly to follow that the King requiring the Com|mons to chu&s;e, he means that the per&s;on by them cho|&s;en &s;hall actually be Speaker, for they are not com|manded to make choice of one or more per&s;ons of whom the King may chu&s;e one, but &s;imply and ab&s;o|lutely to chu&s;e a Speaker for them&s;elves. That the
<PB N="9" REF="042393_0009_101BD8A32C4C9380">
King does not interfere in the choice of a Prolocutor of the Law vocation, which has been called a Parliament in miniature, I conclude, becau&s;e when Dr. <HI>Jane</HI> was preferred to Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> King <HI>William</HI> did not reject, though certainly not as agreeable to the King's prin|ciples, as that excellent man Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI>; and as elec|tions are to be made, according to <HI>Coke, &s;ine prece,</HI> without prayer or gift, &s;o he ob&s;erves they ought al&s;o to be made <HI>&s;ine praecepto,</HI> without the King's command by writ or otherwi&s;e, and he &s;aith an act for that purpo&s;e was a clo&s;e and prudent &s;alve, not only for that &s;ore, but for all other in like ca&s;e, and is but an act declara|tory of the ancient law and cu&s;tom of Parliament.</P>
<P>If we would argue from facts, but one in&s;tance has been produced where the choice of the Commons was excepted again&s;t, and none whatever where the Com|mons &s;ubmitted to a rejection; but the ca&s;e of Sir <HI>Ed|ward Seymour</HI> will come in more fully hereafter. It is difficult to conceive how the Hou&s;e may pre&s;erve free|dom in debate if they are not at liberty to chu&s;e the per&s;on by whom the&s;e debates are to be directed. That they may chu&s;e any man whom the King &s;hall approve is in reality &s;aying they may chu&s;e no man but whom the King approves, and that would &s;eem perfectly equi|valent to they have no right to chu&s;e any man but whom the King chu&s;eth; the King will not approve of any per&s;on but who he is morally &s;ure will enter into all his mea&s;ures; it by any means, whether by influence, nomination, choice, refu&s;al of approbation of any other, the King gets a man of &s;uch a ca&s;t in the chair of the Hou&s;e of Commons, the King then has &s;o far the di|rection, and a mo&s;t powerful influence over the whole Hou&s;e. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That a Speaker may impede the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e in fa|vour of arbitrary mea&s;ures of the Crown we have a &s;triking in&s;tance in the Parliament 1673; the Commons remon&s;trated again&s;t the marriage of the Duke of <HI>York</HI> with a Papi&s;t, which has been pro|ductive of &s;o much mi&s;chief to the nation, "To cut &s;hort the&s;e agreeable attacks, the King re&s;olved to prorogue the Parliament, and with that intent came unexpectedly to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and &s;ent the U&s;her to &s;ummon the Commons.

Such a Spea|ker, under pretence of calling to order, may interrupt the freedom of debate, and &s;top an enquiry into any mal practice or e&s;cape; by a &s;ham &s;ickne&s;s, or his ab|&s;ence from the Hou&s;e, an offender may e&s;cape; but, &s;uppo&s;ing the Crown &s;hould reject a Speaker, on ac|count of his being too popular, or having too great an influence in the Hou&s;e, it would not only be treating the body of Repre&s;entatives as men that are not able to judge for them&s;elves, but it is apparent that the power of rejecting a man becau&s;e he is popular and di&s;agreeable to the Crown is as dangerous a power in the hands of a bad ruler as can well be imagined.</P>
<P>When a Speaker is pre&s;ented to a King for approba|tion the King mu&s;t either be willing that all things &s;hould continue and proceed according to the known Laws and Con&s;titution of the land, or he mu&s;t have contrary views; in the former ca&s;e he can hardly have any motive or cau&s;e to reject any per&s;on that is pre&s;ent|ed, the Speaker alone can make no alteration, and if the Commons &s;hould attempt any thing again&s;t the Crown a di&s;&s;olution would legally en&s;ue; but &s;hould a ruler intend to make any alteration in the laws, a Spea|ker might be a proper in&s;trument in his hand for that purpo&s;e. The King it &s;hould &s;eem can have no rea&s;on or motive to reject any Speaker, but on a &s;u&s;picion of his having a &s;tronger bias to the popular &s;ide than to the ju&s;t Royal Prerogative; but be&s;ides, that the King, in ca&s;e of rejecting &s;uch a one, mu&s;t al&s;o harbour very hard thoughts of his Commons, it is ea&s;ily &s;een what &s;uch a power might lead to. Of a wi&s;e and good Prince nothing is to be apprehended, but again&s;t wicked or weak Princes, or rather pernicious and evil Coun|&s;ellors, the people can never be too much upon their guard.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="042393_0011_101BD8A79C836488">It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, when a Speaker is pre&s;ented, his character and principles can be unknown to the King's Mini&s;ters, but &s;uppo&s;ing they were, I cannot &s;ee how that &s;hould be any ground for rejection; if he is known to be a fit tool the right of rejection will be im|material, he will be &s;ure not to be rejected; if known to be a man zealous for the ju&s;t rights and liberties of the nation, a patriot Prince can have no thought to re|ject &s;uch an one; and that an arbitrary Sovereign, who will not reject a man of a contrary &s;tamp, &s;hould have a right to reject the only man that is fitte&s;t to oppo&s;e him and &s;erve the nation, I think a very dangerous part of the Prerogative, and I am at a perfect lo&s;s how to reconcile &s;uch a power with the &s;pirit and de&s;ign of the Con&s;titution of a free people.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations I mu&s;t own &s;trongly influence me to doubt whether the Crown has a con&s;titutional right to &s;et a&s;ide and reject a Speaker cho&s;en by the Repre&s;entatives of the people. It is but fair, however, to hear what has been &s;aid in &s;upport of this right, and I do not mean that the arguments in favour of it &s;hould lo&s;e any of their force in my hands, I mean to repre&s;ent them in all their weight, and as to the&s;e arguments and my remarks <HI>valeant quantum valere po&s;&s;unt,</HI> let them go as far as they may.</P>
<P>Two writers have appeared among us in favour of this claim of the Prerogative; what <HI>NEUTER</HI> advanced, like his &s;ignature, is nothing neither here nor there; but, as he talks of a contagious political delirium, I am much afraid he has been in the neighbourhood of the contagion, however I wi&s;h him well over.</P>
<P>I intend to con&s;ider every argument of <HI>G. B. &s;i per|gama dextra defendi potui&s;&s;ent hac vice defen&s;a fui&s;&s;ent.</HI> I dare &s;ay what books and arguments in this cau&s;e are not found with him will in vain be looked for any where el&s;e in this province.</P>
<P>Two pa&s;&s;ages have been quoted from <HI>Coke</HI> in &s;upport of this negative; <HI>Coke</HI> &s;aith: "<HI>The Commons &s;hall pre&s;ent their Speaker in the Upper Hou&s;e to the King, who &s;hall di&s;|able him&s;elf, and in mo&s;t humble manner intreat the King to command them to chu&s;e a more &s;ufficient man.</HI>" From this pa&s;&s;age it is &s;aid to appear that the new Speaker in the face of the whole Hou&s;e of Commons admits a power
<PB N="12" REF="042393_0012_101BD8A935D84D40">
of rejection in the Crown; but is not this rather a large conclu&s;ion from &s;mall premi&s;es? Does not the Speaker's intreaty that the King would order a fitter man to be cho&s;en &s;avour as much of compliment as any thing el&s;e? Does it not at lea&s;t look as much like compliment as like an acknowledgment of the right of rejection? However, if this proves any &s;uch right, the argument I conceive mu&s;t &s;tand thus: The Speaker is to di&s;able him&s;elf, (<HI>i. e.</HI> plead his inability) and intreat the King to command the Commons to chu&s;e a fitter man; there|fore (becau&s;e he pleads his inability, and wi&s;heth a fit|ter man may be cho&s;en) the Crown has a clear right to put a negative on any man the Commons &s;hall chu&s;e as their Speaker. I de&s;pair to convince that man of any thing, except what he him&s;elf plea&s;eth, who can be convinced by &s;uch an argument. <HI>Coke</HI> al&s;o &s;aith: "<HI>It is true the Commons are to chu&s;e, but &s;eeing that after their choice the King may refu&s;e him, for avoiding of expence and time, and conte&s;tation, the u&s;e is, (as in the cong&eacute; d' e&s;lier of a Bi&s;hop) that the King doth name a di&s;creet and learned man, whom the Commons elect, but without their election no Speaker can be appointed for them.</HI>" The only expre&s;&s;ion in this pa&s;&s;age that may be con&s;trued in &s;upport of this claim is, that the King <HI>may</HI> refu&s;e. It has been ob&s;erved that all this may mean no more than that the King may do it though he has no con&s;titutional right &s;o to do; and to this it has been an&s;wered, that <HI>Coke</HI> declares what he writes is grounded upon the authority and rea&s;on of books, rolls of Parliament, and judicial records, and that to make any objection again&s;t it is to make objec|tions not again&s;t <HI>Coke,</HI> but (for&s;ooth) again&s;t the Con|&s;titution it&s;elf; but as no book, authority, rea&s;on, par|liamentary roll, or judicial record, has been produced older than this pa&s;&s;age, I apprehend all this, notwith|&s;tanding what <HI>Coke</HI> &s;aith with regard to the King's <HI>may</HI> may be bare narrative &s;till, and no legal declaration of what the King may legally do; and I am the more in|clined to doubt this matter, becau&s;e I find <HI>Coke</HI> does not always &s;peak like a Legi&s;lator, or one that declares the law; in this ca&s;e, <HI>e. g.</HI> he &s;aith every Member of the Hou&s;e being a Coun&s;ellor, he &s;hould have three pro|perties of the elephant&mdash;that he has no gall&mdash;that he is inflexible and cannot bow&mdash;and that he is of ripe and
<PB N="13" REF="042393_0013_101BD8AF0BEB1238">
mo&s;t perfect memory. Now this &s;eems a very good &s;imile, but that any law declares a Member of Parlia|ment &s;hould be like an elephant I &s;till doubt, though I think all that write and act in publick ought to be with|out gall, and all Legi&s;lators inflexibly right. I don't know when <HI>Coke</HI> wrote, but &s;hould any writer now a&s;|&s;ert, while the Parliament &s;its, the King has as much authority in the choice of their Speaker as in the elec|tion of a Bi&s;hop by cong&eacute; d' e&s;lier, he would hardly be in any danger of receiving the thanks of the Hou&s;e; but perhaps the&s;e things may better &s;uit the meridian of <HI>Georgia,</HI> and, great as the authority is, I pre&s;ume it is no trea&s;on to &s;ay that the Con&s;titution is now better un|der&s;tood than even a <HI>Coke</HI> explained it in the days of the <HI>Stuarts</HI>; and yet after all he expre&s;sly &s;aith, though he &s;eems to begin rather abruptly: True it is the Com|mons mu&s;t chu&s;e their own Speaker, and he cannot be appointed for them. All that was thought law in the days of <HI>Coke</HI> has not been thought &s;o &s;ince. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> the great oracle of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> law, had not only concurred witn all other Lawyers in favour of this Prerogative of di&s;pen&s;ing power, but &s;eems even to believe it &s;o inherent to the Crown that an act of Parliament it&s;elf could not aboli&s;h it, becau&s;e from the law of nature the King has a right to the &s;ervice of all his &s;ubjects. <HI>Hume's Hi&s;t. of England,</HI> vi. 394, On this principle Papi&s;ts may be made Coun&s;ellors in <HI>Grenada,</HI> and why not in <HI>England?</HI> and men of known loyalty and approved abilities may be rejected as Speakers.

<P>I am really &s;urprized at the &s;tre&s;s that has been laid on the ca&s;e of Sir <HI>Edward Seymour,</HI> rejected by <HI>Charles</HI> II. in 1679. It has been &s;aid "he was rejected," "the King never gave the matter up," "prorogued the Hou&s;e for a <HI>few days,</HI>" "that the Hou&s;e dropt the matter," which it &s;eems they had mi&s;taken," "and proceeded to the choice of another per&s;on," (<HI>See Geor|gia Gazette for April</HI> 29, 1772:) And again, (<HI>Georgia Gazette for May</HI> 13) "that the King a&s;&s;erted the right of nomination," "rejected one Speaker and nominated another," and, <HI>N. B.</HI> becau&s;e "the Hou&s;e declined to
<PB N="14" REF="042393_0014_101BD8B1F84B6468">
chu&s;e him prorogued them," "that the Hou&s;e did not a&s;&s;ert their right but chu&s;ed <HI>Gregory,</HI>" "and did not &s;hew a want of publick &s;pirit by impeding publick bu&s;i|ne&s;s, had they done &s;o it is &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Charles</HI> would have di&s;&s;olved them, left they &s;hould &s;erve him the &s;ame trick that had been &s;erved his father:" And again, (<HI>Georgia Gazette May</HI> 29) "that in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion they repaired their mi&s;take, and cho&s;e a different per&s;on." Now, whoever puts all this together will naturally con|clude, that the Commons cho&s;e a Speaker di&s;agreeable to the King, whom the King rejected; that, on their not re&s;cinding their choice, the King in&s;i&s;ted on his hav|ing &s;uch a right, and never gave it up, but prorogued them for &s;ome days, and that then they dropt the matter, repaired their mi&s;take, gave up their claim &s;o far that now "it can't be &s;aid to be undecided," cho&s;e another per&s;on, and &s;o all was well, the King's right e&s;tabli&s;hed, and whoever now thinks and &s;aith otherwi&s;e is a fiery Republican, and as bad (or nearly) as the Long Par|liament. I do not mean to criticize upon this account given by an author of whom it has been &s;aid "that he writes un&s;oured by party, and with an apparent view to give candid information;" but I advi&s;e the reader next to peru&s;e a different account given by two authors who have never been deemed partial, and who at lea&s;t cannot be &s;aid to be influenced by our <HI>Georgia</HI> di&s;putes.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Rapin:</HI> The Parliament began with a warm di&s;pute between the King and the Commons about the choice of a Speaker. The Commons having cho&s;en Mr. <HI>Edward Seymour,</HI> the King, who knew <HI>Seymour</HI> was a particular enemy of the Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> refu&s;ed his approbation, and ordered the Commons to proceed to a new choice. The Hou&s;e was extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with this refu&s;al, alledging, that it was never known that a per&s;on &s;hould be excepted again&s;t, and no rea&s;on given, and <HI>that the thing it&s;elf of pre&s;enting a Speaker to the King was but a bare compliment.</HI> The King, on his &s;ide, in&s;i&s;ted on the approbation or refu&s;al of a Speaker when pre&s;ented to him as a branch of his Prerogative. During a &s;ix days di&s;pute, the Commons made &s;everal repre&s;entations to the King, to which he gave very &s;hort an&s;wers. At la&s;t, as the Commons would not de&s;i&s;t from what they thought their right, the King went
<PB N="15" REF="042393_0015_101BD8B381987280">
to the Parliament, and prorogued it from the 13th to the 15th, that is, for <HI>ONE</HI> day's interval between the two <HI>SESSIONS.</HI> The Parliament meeting the 15th, the King ordered the Commons to proceed to the choice of a Speaker; then, to avoid a revival of the di&s;pute, they cho&s;e Mr. <HI>William Gregory,</HI> Serjeant at Law, who was approved by the King. <HI>Rapin, vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 703.</P>
<P>The account given in the Parliamentary Debates is &s;till fuller:</P>
<P>The Chancellor, by the King's commands, ordered the Hou&s;e of Commons to proceed to the choice of a Speaker, who was to be pre&s;ented to the King the next day; and being returned to their Hou&s;e, Colonel <HI>Birch</HI> did nomi|nate and recommend the Right Honourable <HI>Edward Seymour,</HI> Knight of the Shire for the county of <HI>Devon,</HI> Trea&s;urer of the Navy, one of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Ho|nourable Privy-Council, and Speaker of the la&s;t Par|liament: Being a per&s;on acceptable to the King, and one who for his great integrity, ability, and long ex|perience in the employment, was the fitte&s;t per&s;on for &s;o great a tru&s;t. And Mr. <HI>Seymour</HI> being unanimou&s;ly called upon to the chair, was conducted thither by Sir <HI>Thomas Lee,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Whitmore,</HI> and divers other mem|bers, and being there placed, he made a gratulatory &s;peech to the Hou&s;e for their great kindne&s;s and affection towards him, in their unanimous choice of him: But &s;till he de&s;ired the Hou&s;e that they would proceed to a new election,
<Q>For the long &s;ittings of the late Parlia|ment had &s;o impaired his health, that he doubted he &s;hould not be well able to undergo the &s;ervice of the Hou&s;e as would be expected from him:</Q>
But the Hou&s;e not admitting of any excu&s;e, confirmed their choice; upon which <HI>be de&s;ired leave,</HI>
<Q>That he might intercede with his Maje&s;ty, that he would be plea&s;ed to di&s;charge him of the duty.</Q></P>
<P>But it appears, that he need not have been &s;o ur|gent; for the King and the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> taking this choice to be an ill pre&s;age, that this Parliament would begin where the la&s;t ended, were re&s;olved not to approve of it: And as &s;oon as he appeared to be per&s;ented, the Lord Chancellor &s;tood up, and &s;aid,
<Q>That if his Maje&s;ty &s;hould always accept a per&s;on pitcht upon by the Hou&s;e of Commons, then it would be no great favour to be
<PB N="16" REF="042393_0016_101BD8B50F4FC108">
cho&s;en a Speaker; and therefore his Maje&s;ty, being the be&s;t judge of per&s;ons and things, thought fit to except again&s;t Mr. <HI>Seymour,</HI> as being fitly qualifyed for other &s;ervices and imployments, without giving any rea&s;on to the per&s;ons chu&s;ing or the per&s;ons cho&s;en.</Q>
And therefore he ordered them to fix upon &s;ome other per&s;on by to-morrow morning, to be pre&s;ented to the King for his approbation. The Commons immediately returned back to their own Hou&s;e, where Sir <HI>John Ernly</HI> &s;tood up and acquainted them,
<Q>He had orders from his Maje&s;ty to recommend Sir <HI>Thomas Meers</HI> to them to be their Speaker, as a per&s;on well known in the method and practice of Parliaments, and a per&s;on that he thought would be very acceptable and &s;erviceable to them.</Q>
But the Hou&s;e in a great heat cryed out, <HI>No, no!</HI> and fell into a warm debate. Mr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> &s;aid,
<Q>It was never known that a per&s;on &s;hould be excepted again&s;t, and no rea&s;on at all given, and therefore concluded, that it was done purpo&s;ely to gratify &s;ome particular per&s;ons. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> &s;aid for above a hundred years, it had not been known that a Speaker pre&s;ented was ever excepted again&s;t; and the thing it&s;elf of pre&s;enting him to the King, as he humbly con|ceived, was but a bare compliment. Sir <HI>Thomas Clarges</HI> alledged, that there were Parliaments long before there were Speakers cho&s;en, and afterwards, for the ea&s;e of the Hou&s;e among them&s;elves, they pitched upon a Speaker.&mdash;All our lives and liberties are pre&s;erved by this Hou&s;e, therefore we are to pre&s;erve the liberties of it. Mr. <HI>Garraway</HI> objected, if Mr. <HI>Seymour</HI> be rejected and no rea&s;on given, pray who mu&s;t chu&s;e a Speaker, the King or we? It is plain not we?&mdash;Sir <HI>Thomas Lee</HI> &s;aid, we addre&s;s'd our&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty the la&s;t Parliament, as fearing his per&s;on to be in danger, but we received no an&s;wer at all in a whole week; we were immediately prorogued unexpectedly; and a little after di&s;&s;olved, as unexpectedly; and I &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;ame per&s;ons that gave that advice, gave this al&s;o.</Q>
Others concluded, that all this was only for a bone of contention, fearing they &s;hould agree, and &s;o called to adjourn; which was &s;oon agreed to.</P>
<P>The&s;e heats were &s;o much the greater, becau&s;e they rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that it was all occa&s;ioned by the Earl
<PB N="17" REF="042393_0017_101BD8BC4408BED0">
of <HI>Danby</HI>; who&s;e power was not wholly at an end; and between whom and Mr. <HI>Seymour</HI> there was a particular re&s;entment. However, the fir&s;t thing re&s;olved on the next day, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> was,
<Q>That an humble appli|cation be made to the King, to acquaint his Maje&s;ty, that the matter ye&s;terday delivered by the Lord Chancellor, relating to the Speaker, is of &s;o great importance, that this Hou&s;e cannot immediately come to a re&s;olution therein: And therefore do humbly de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty, that he will graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed, to grant &s;ome further time for this Hou&s;e to take the matter into con&s;ideration.</Q>
And they ordered the Chancellor of the dutchy, the Lord <HI>Cavendi&s;h,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> and Sir <HI>Henry Capel,</HI> immediately to attend his Maje&s;ty with this vote. Being returned in a &s;hort time, the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> acquainted the Hou&s;e, That they had attended his Maje&s;ty, who was &s;itting in Council; and that his Maje&s;ty, as &s;oon as he was informed they were to wait upon him from the Hou&s;e immediately came out, and received them with great chearfulne&s;s and kindne&s;s: And having delivered their me&s;&s;age, his Maje&s;ty retired to the Council-Chamber, and coming out again, was plea&s;ed to return the following an&s;wer by word of mouth, which they had reduced to writing:

And &s;ince we do humbly conceive, that the occa&s;ion of this que&s;tion hath ari&s;en from your Maje&s;ty's not being truly informed of the &s;tate of the ca&s;e; we humbly be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to take the &s;aid repre&s;en|tation into your further con&s;ideration, and give us &s;uch a gracious an&s;wer, that we may be put in a capacity to manife&s;t our readine&s;s to enter into the&s;e con&s;ultations which nece&s;&s;arily tend to the pre&s;ervation and welfare of your Maje&s;ty and your kingdoms.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Upon reading this addre&s;s to the King, he immediately gave this quick and &s;harp return; <HI>Gentlemen, I will &s;end you an an&s;wer to-morrow.</HI> Accordingly, as he had often done before upon great difficulties, he re&s;olved to put an end to the di&s;pute; and on the next morning, being <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 13th of <HI>March,</HI> he came to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and &s;ending for the Commons, he immediately prorogued the Parliament till <HI>Saturday</HI> following, after the Commons had &s;at without a Speaker but &s;ix days. And thus the King found a way to gain his point, but with very little advantage to his own bu&s;ine&s;s and affairs.</P>
<P>On the appointed day, <HI>March</HI> 15th, his Maje&s;ty came to the Hou&s;e of Peers in his Royal robes, and the Hou&s;e of Commons attending, his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to put both Hou&s;es in mind of what he &s;aid to them at the opening of the Parliament: And then the Lord Chancel|lor,
<PB N="20" REF="042393_0020_101BD8BF4AB1E270">
by the King's command, directed the Commons to return to their Hou&s;e, and to proceed to the choice of a Speaker. And being returned, the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> put the Hou&s;e in mind of the King's commands, and imme|diately recommended <HI>William Gregory</HI> Sergeant at law, <HI>as a per&s;on, for his great learning and integrity, fit for the employment.</HI> And Mr. Sergeant <HI>Gregory</HI> being unanimou&s;ly called upon to the chair, he in a &s;hort &s;peech mode&s;tly excu&s;ed him&s;elf, and de&s;ired of the Hou&s;e, that another might be nominated; but no excu&s;e being admitted, he was formally conducted to the chair, by his two intimate friends, the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cavendi&s;h,</HI> and there confirmed in the place.</P>
<P>"On the <HI>Monday</HI> following, he was pre&s;ented by the Commons to the King&punc; in the Hou&s;e of Lords, who without he&s;itation approved of the choice." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Edward Seymour</HI> having &s;o often been mentioned in this de|bate, it may not be ami&s;s to take &s;ome notice of his character as drawn by <HI>Burnet,</HI> and of his behaviour as Speaker: "In pride he had neither &s;hame nor decency: He was violent again&s;t the Court till he forced him&s;elf into good po&s;ts: He knew the Hou&s;e, and every man in it, &s;o well, that by looking about he could tell the fate of any que&s;tion: He was the mo&s;t a&s;&s;uming Speaker that ever &s;at in the chair: If any thing was put when the Court party was not well gathered together, he would have held the Hou&s;e from doing any thing by a wilful mi&s;taking or mis&s;tating the que&s;tion; by that he gave time to tho&s;e who were appointed for that mercenary work to go about and gather in all their party, and he would di&s;|cern when they had got the majority, and THEN he would very fairly &s;tate the que&s;tion WHEN he was &s;ure to carry it." It is mo&s;t likely that in favour of &s;uch a man the Court party would exert all their influence to get him cho&s;en, and very improbable that being cho&s;en the Commons would &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly have oppo&s;ed his rejecti|on, if they had not thought it illegal and a dangerous precedent; but from this very in&s;tance it appears to demon&s;tration how e&s;&s;en|tial it is to the regularity, freedom, and ju&s;t i&s;&s;ue of national de|bates, that no &s;uch Speaker &s;hould by any means be obtruded, or one of a contrary &s;tamp be rejected. The Commons maintained their claim as long as they were &s;uffered to continue, and till a pro|rogation put an end to all their proceedings. At the next &s;e&s;&s;ion they might be the more unwilling to revive their former choice be|cau&s;e they could ea&s;ily fix upon a better man; <HI>Gregory</HI> was then cho&s;en, and in the two &s;ucceeding Parliaments that very <HI>Williams</HI> who had a&s;&s;erted that the pre&s;enting the Speaker to the King was a bare compliment; the King did not &s;hew any re&s;entment, but approved of him without he&s;itation. The true rea&s;on of <HI>Seymour</HI>'s rejection, who had been Speaker before, was this: The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> expected to be pro&s;ecuted for things done by the King's or|der; the King, in order to &s;ecure him, granted him a pardon in a very illegal manner; <HI>Seymour</HI> was looked upon as <HI>Danby</HI>'s enemy, and it was thought too dangerous that upon this occa&s;ion he &s;hould be Speaker; hence the King rather excu&s;ed him&s;elf for not admit|ting than har&s;hly rejected him; and thus it appears that this re|jection was made with a manife&s;t view to ob&s;truct publick ju&s;tice, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the right of rejection was never claimed nor contended for but upon this &s;ingle occa&s;ion, it does not &s;eem to derive any merit from the only in&s;tance when it was pleaded.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="042393_0021_101BD8C0E4383398">I &s;hall not make many remarks on the&s;e accounts, but I cannot forbear ob&s;erving that the only in&s;tance where a Speaker appears rejected by the Crown was in the reign of a <HI>Stuart,</HI> when there was a &s;ettled de&s;ign again&s;t the religion and liberties of the nation, which is far from being a pre&s;umption favourable to &s;uch a claim; even then the King does not reject <HI>ex plenitudine potestatis,</HI> but <HI>a&s;&s;igns as a rea&s;on</HI> that Sir <HI>Edward Seymour</HI> was proper for other &s;ervices; and yet the Commons tell the King, that to chu&s;e their Speaker without be|ing deprived of their choice is their undoubted right. When <HI>Charles</HI> recommended another as one who he thought would be very acceptable and &s;erviceable to <HI>THEM,</HI> they cried, No, no, and never would nor did chu&s;e him; the King wi&s;heth then to find an expedient, did not in&s;i&s;t on his nomination, but prorogued them for a &s;ingle day, which was plainly done to compromi&s;e the matter; when they met again, he recommended nobody, but Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> who afterwards fell a martyr to liberty, nominated <HI>Gregory,</HI> who was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en, and formally conducted to the chair, and there-confirmed in the place, and <HI>Monday</HI> after the King ap|proved of him without he&s;itation. <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his me|moirs, expre&s;sly &s;aith the point was &s;ettled, that the right of electing was in the Hou&s;e, and that the con|firmation was a thing of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The argument, that if the King has no right to reject he may be under a nece&s;&s;ity of admitting di&s;agreeable per&s;ons into his pre&s;ence, as per&s;ons may be cho&s;en di&s;|affected to his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government, of which <HI>Wilkes</HI> being made Sheriff is given as an example, I cannot think of any great &s;trength. I &s;uppo&s;e the law calls no man di&s;affected who takes the oaths pre&s;cribed by law, and if any &s;hould be per&s;onally di&s;agreeable to the King there is no nece&s;&s;ity for his coming into his pre&s;ence. <HI>Wilkes</HI> I believe never did, but I conceive
<PB N="22" REF="042393_0022_101BD8C6A968FB90">
the Con&s;titution di&s;ables no man to &s;erve his country in any place not in the gift of the Crown merely becau&s;e he may be di&s;agreeable to the King. The &s;ame Parlia|ment that cho&s;e <HI>Seymour</HI> deputed Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> to the King, who never was a friend to the King's mea&s;ures, and yet <HI>Charles</HI> had more grace than to receive him o|therwi&s;e than politely. The right of rejecting a di&s;a|greeable per&s;on can be of no manner of &s;ervice to the Crown, unle&s;s it may be exerci&s;ed as often as a di&s;agree|able per&s;on is cho&s;en. Suppo&s;ing the ca&s;e to happen, it can hardly be expected that a Hou&s;e &s;o ill di&s;po&s;ed as to chu&s;e a di&s;agreeable per&s;on at fir&s;t would become &s;o good-natured, by the afront of a rejection, as to chu&s;e a per&s;on more agreeable in a &s;econd election; or, &s;up|po&s;ing elections were repeated till the Commons gave way and cho&s;e a per&s;on perfectly agreeable to the Crown, what mu&s;t be the natural con&s;equence to the people? it can be no other than an expre&s;s introduction of a Mem|ber would have to repre&s;ent the King. The Speaker is not the King's Repre&s;entative, but if the Crown in|&s;i&s;ts none &s;hall be Speaker but one that will obey the orders, or, which may be ju&s;t the &s;ame, is agreeable to the King, he might as well; in that ca&s;e the King would have an Officer in the Hou&s;e, introduced, not by bribery and corruption, but by refu&s;ing to approve any other, and he might have the ca&s;ting vote in a place where he ought to have no vote at all.</P>
<P>That <HI>to pre&s;ent a Speaker for approbation implies a right of rejection</HI> has been alledged with greater &s;hew; but that it is the Commons choice, and not the King's approbation, that con&s;titutes the Speaker, &s;eems very plain, becau&s;e he is placed in the chair immediately after the election, and &s;ometimes acts as &s;uch &s;ome days before he is pre&s;ented and approved of by the King. It would be very indecent to ve&s;t him in the office, and place him in the chair, if after all the King's negative might &s;et a&s;ide the choice; and I would apply here what Sir <HI>R. Atkins</HI> &s;aith with regard to a form ob&s;erved at the &s;ame time when the Speaker is pre&s;ented, "<HI>That humble and mode&s;t way of the people's addre&s;&s;ing their Sovereign, &mdash; for granting privileges,</HI>" of which the right to chu&s;e and have a Speaker &s;eems nece&s;&s;arily one) "<HI>&s;hows great reverence and becomes the maje&s;ty of the Prince to be addre&s;&s;ed to; but let it not be made an argument that either the laws thereupon made, or the privileges allowed, are precarious, and merely a favour, or may he refu&s;ed them of right.</HI>" There are many pre&s;entations in law which allow not of rejection. The u&s;ual privileges, without which the Hou&s;e cannot act nor &s;ub&s;i&s;t, mu&s;t be a&s;ked for; but as this is a petition not of favour, but of right, &s;o it &s;eems the approbation of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">|ker is as much &s;o. If the Con&s;titution requires &s;ome application <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 
<PB N="23" REF="042393_0023_101BD8C99FD08418">
the King, it al&s;o obliges the Crown never to put a negative on &s;ome applications. The new Speaker humbly <HI>PRAYS</HI> for the privileges of the Hou&s;e, but &s;hould any Prince be &s;o ill-advi&s;ed as to look upon that application as a matter which he may refu&s;e, he might perhaps be informed that &s;uch a refu&s;al implied no le&s;s than a breach of the original contract between him and his people, and that in this ca&s;e it would be in vain to &s;ay that the power of giving (or approving) al&s;o implies a power of refu&s;ing.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that this claim of the Crown was but once denied by Parliament; I believe it was always denied; but it might as well have been &s;aid it was but once claimed by the Crown. Some weight is laid on the circum&s;tance that a Speaker was recommended as acceptable to the King, but it &s;eems the King al&s;o recommended a man as one whom he &s;uppo&s;ed very acceptable to Parliament. When a &s;uperior recommends to an inferior it is no argument that tho&s;e to whom he recommends have not a final choice. That a per&s;on <HI>(caeteris paribus)</HI> is acceptable to the King may be no improper re|commendation to or motive with his electors.</P>
<P>To e&s;tabli&s;h this claim of the Crown, it has been ob&s;erved, that Speakers have been di&s;allowed, like Sir <HI>John Popham</HI>; but the ca&s;e amounts to no more than his excu&s;e was admitted; formerly every Speaker begged leave of the Hou&s;e that he might excu&s;e him&s;elf to the King; this reque&s;t of leave &s;eems rather a proof that the election of the Hou&s;e is looked upon as final than otherwi&s;e, and <HI>Popham,</HI> though his excu&s;e mu&s;t have been very good, appears the only in|&s;tance in which it was admitted, and cannot be of much weight a|gain&s;t &s;o many in&s;tances where no excu&s;e was allowed. It is very certain the King did not approve <HI>Seymour,</HI> but it is not le&s;s &s;o that, in order to get rid of the choice, he was obliged to prorogue the Hou&s;e, and that all he gained is, that the Commons did not revive the di&s;pute. The acquie&s;cing of the Repre&s;entatives of <HI>New Eng|land</HI> under a negative put on their choice is entirely owing to the te|nor of their charter, and I am &s;till of opinion that what rights the King re&s;erved to him&s;elf in that charter are not &s;uch as are the un|doubted prerogative of the Crown, but &s;uch as every A&s;&s;embly or Parliament has a ju&s;t claim to where the contrary it not expre&s;sly &s;ti|pulated by charter.</P>
<P>It has been advanced, that "<HI>when the King gave the Commons leave to chu&s;e a Speaker he re&s;erved to him&s;elf the right of rejecting a Speaker that might be di&s;agreeable to him, and that there was a compact between the King and Commons for that purpo&s;e.</HI>" This would be a &s;trong argument indeed; but when and where was that compact made? What au|thor or hi&s;torian &s;peaks of it? What authority is cited in proof of it? "<HI>Why it is natural to conclude,</HI>" but is it not as natural to conclude that, becau&s;e no traces of any &s;uch compact are to be found, and that the Commons always regularly cho&s;e their own Speaker, and that not even an attempt was ever made to reject him, but in the ca&s;e of Sir <HI>Edward Seymour,</HI> and that then the King never made any men|tion of &s;uch an original compact, but &s;ubmitted to have his own nomination treated with a negative, and approved of one cho&s;en in oppo&s;ition to his own former recommendation, that therefore no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> compact ever exi&s;ted? And as this country it very "&s;carce of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">" I am clearly of opinion <HI>that</HI> book is not on this &s;ide of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> where this compact &s;tands upon record, but if a copy, or di|rection <PB N="24" REF="042393_0024_101BD8CB21FAA778">
where this compact may be found, is left with the Priter it &s;hall be duly acknowledged, and, if the owner chu&s;es it, a pro|mi&s;e given that his name &s;hall not be mentioned.</P>
<P>I ought to take notice of one argument more, (<HI>Georgia Gazette June</HI> 24:) "<HI>If the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay hold their provincial Legi&s;lation under charter, do not we in this province hold it under his Maje&s;ty's com|mi&s;&s;ion and in&s;truction to his Repre&s;entative? And if that charter has re&s;erved the power of negation upon their choice of a Speaker, will not the commi&s;&s;ions and in&s;tructions to the Governor of this province have the &s;ame effect?</HI> I conceive a very great difference between his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions and charters; an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> I &s;hould think entitled to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> laws, which I &s;uppo&s;e implies Legi&s;lation any where and every where in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions; that this right is prior to any charter or in|&s;truction, and is held not by in&s;tructions to a Governor, but is his natural right, which nothing but outlawry can deprive him of Whatever is not law cannot be binding upon a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubject, and I &s;uppo&s;e no man will &s;ay that, becau&s;e the King has an undoubted right to in&s;truct his &s;ervants, that therefore he has al&s;o a right to give in&s;tructions contrary to the Con&s;titution, or derogatory of the right of the &s;ubject; &s;uch an in&s;truction a Governor might look upon as a law to him&s;elf, but it is only the King can do no wrong, and the rea&s;on is plain, becau&s;e the King can do nothing again&s;t law or the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that a Speaker may have an undue influence to the prejudice of the Crown; but he can <HI>have</HI> no undue influence to Speaker before he is really &s;uch, and it cannot <HI>appear</HI> that he has any undue influence before he has actually entered on his office, and in this ca&s;e the Crown is &s;ufficiently guarded by its indi&s;putable negative on every act of Legi&s;lature, and of di&s;&s;olution whenever it &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary. By this al&s;o it would &s;eem as if the Crown had a right to reject a Speaker actually approved of when|ever his influence &s;hould become di&s;agreeable, which doctrine I believe is entirely new, perhaps not free from danger.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;embly of this province &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;ted only of 19 Members; 9 then made a Hou&s;e, and 5 a majority; as the number of Repre&s;entatives increa&s;ed it was thought nece&s;&s;ary that the num|ber to con&s;titute a Hou&s;e &s;hould be increa&s;ed in proportion; 19 now make a Hou&s;e, and 10 a majority, to do any bu&s;ine&s;s relating to the province. The remark that the &s;trenuous advocate of the right of negative makes upon this alteration is this: "<HI>Such re&s;olutions</HI> (which by the way were unanimous) <HI>could be made with no other view than the putting it in the power of a few leading men to impede the publick bu&s;ine&s;s by a &s;ece&s;&s;ion whenever they plea&s;ed</HI>; which remark, as I &s;uppo&s;e it had not been made had any A&s;&s;embly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, &s;o every reader will judge with what ju&s;tice and temperit was made. That he wi&s;hes 5 men might have the power rather than 10 is &s;elf-evident, and that 1 man may more ea&s;ily influence 4 or 5 than 9 or 10 need not be doubted.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with a citation from a debate in the Hou&s;e of Lords in 1675: "<HI>The Lords plainly &s;poke out, That men had been, might and were likely to be, in either Hou&s;e, too much for the King, as they called it, and that whoever did endeavour to give more power to the King than the law and Con&s;titution had given, &mdash; might ju&s;tly be &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> too much for the King, and to be corrupted in his judgment by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> advantages and rewards, though when it is con&s;idered that every <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Crown towards ab&s;olute power le&s;&s;ens the King in the love <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of his people,&mdash;a wi&s;e Prince will not think it a &s;ervice done him.</HI></P>
