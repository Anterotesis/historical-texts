<P>MY regard for the good of my country is &s;uch, that I cannot be &s;ilent at this alarm|ing cri&s;is, when party prejudices are car|ried to an extreme: And as when our po|litical debates have en&s;nared and confounded the po|pulace, rather than informed and enlightened them; and have engaged them in a dangerous political en|thu&s;ia&s;m; when by fraud or otherwi&s;e, many parti|culars of the utmo&s;t concern were omitted. I there|fore a&s;k your calm and di&s;pa&s;ionate enquiry and at|tention to &s;ome intere&s;ting con&s;iderations and &s;pecial remarks; which if read and examined with candor, may &s;erve to calm unruly pa&s;&s;ions, and lead you to form &s;ome ju&s;t &s;entiments on the controver&s;y. I hope for your approbation, and that I &s;hall ever be e&s;teemed as a &s;incere friend to our liberties, and the good of my country; and as one who has ever been again&s;t all unju&s;t incroachments on our rights and privileges, or a tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to acts of parliament that might &s;ubject us to an unlimited power of taxa|tion; and as one who would gladly &s;ee a ju&s;t deter|mination
<PB N="4" REF="014462_0003_0F92B1055C5CF0C8">
of what is due to the king as our &s;overeign, and to us as his loyal and free &s;ubjects. It is to be lamented that the populace have been &s;o ready to en|gage in the mo&s;t fatal and daring enterprizes; and that a good cau&s;e had &s;uffered &s;o much by the imprudence of our advocates. There are &s;ome who indi&s;crimi|nately condemn all the whigs, for the fault of &s;ome popular zealo's, who, from the beginning have de|ceived and mi&s;led the populace; and with the &s;peci|ous &s;hew of patrioti&s;m have retained the lead in our public affairs, (which was the &s;ource and origin of our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es) and have in our late times of general di&s;content and confu&s;ion, increa&s;ed their influ|ence by &s;hewing contempt to government, and by invectives again&s;t tho&s;e who were for moderate mea|&s;ures; repre&s;enting them as enemies to their country. But &s;uch proceedings can never be of any real bene|fit to us. We have indeed good rea&s;on to di&s;pi&s;e them, who, for their own private emolument, would give up the rights and liberties of their country; and to re&s;pect and revere tho&s;e, who, from a regard for the &s;afety of it, and ju&s;t &s;entiments of government, have endeavored to convince us of our danger, and &s;ubmitted to become unpopular and lo&s;e their influ|ence in &s;ociety by it: And have not the mo&s;t &s;en&s;i|ble and judicious of our &s;ons of liberty, di&s;allowed all &s;uch proceedings, and hoped to &s;ee &s;ome ju&s;t and mo|derate propo&s;als originate in our a&s;&s;emblies or con|gre&s;s, for an accommodation? But what may we now expect from a view of our affairs? We find that his maje&s;ty, who has been our kind protector, con&s;iders us as guilty of acts of violence of a crimi|nal nature. And can we &s;uppo&s;e that the proceed|ings of the continental congre&s;s, will afford us relief, or that they duly con&s;idered what was recommended to them by the grand committee, met at Philadel|phia
<PB N="5" REF="014462_0004_0F92B105985D8C80">
in July la&s;t, "which was for the Colonies to propo&s;e the payment of a certain annual revenue to his maje&s;ty; and damages for the tea de&s;troyed, in order to procure his maje&s;ty's favor." And now pray con&s;ider whether their a&s;&s;ociation and re&s;olves will have &s;uch influence in our favor as to excite in the hou&s;e of commons, &s;uch &s;pirited exertions, as may procure a repeal of their late acts; or whether our late violent proceedings will not rather unite them more firmly again&s;t us, and cau&s;e the mini&s;terial con|trover&s;y, to terminate in a national one? And have we not rea&s;on to fear that the late addre&s;s of our con|tinental congre&s;s and their &s;pirited mea&s;ures and re|&s;olves, will induce the king and parliament to con&s;i|der them as founded on republican principles; and that their de&s;igns were to become independent or &s;omething more, as they have a&s;&s;med to be arbiters for Quebec? And has what our delegates called an humble petition from faithful &s;ubjects, propo&s;ed any one conciliating mea&s;ure, or addre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty with tho&s;e tender and dutiful regards which might be expected from dependent and loyal &s;ubjects; or offered to palliate for our public offences, or for the de&s;troying of private property, that occa&s;ioned the king and parliament to go into &s;ome &s;pirited mea|&s;ures; or have they propo&s;ed a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to parlia|ment in any one in&s;tance? And does not the &s;ame &s;pirit appear in their addre&s;s, that prevailed in their approving the precipitate re&s;olves of the county of Suffolk? Therefore I think that you cannot be at a lo&s;s, but may ju&s;tly conclude, that their de&s;igns were, (as one of their delegates &s;aid) to excite fear rather than other regards. And did they not in faithfulne&s;s to his maje&s;ty lay many grievous things to his charge, exculpating the Colonies from all offences, except it was one to be &s;en&s;ible of injuries? And &s;uch was the
<PB N="6" REF="014462_0005_0F92B1061851BD10">
ab&s;urd credulity of the people in the Colonies that they generally approved their proceedings before they knew what they were. And can you &s;uppo&s;e that their addre&s;s, with formal profe&s;&s;ions of duty, loyalty, humility and affection to his maje&s;ty, and the mo&s;t &s;olemn appeal in re&s;pect to their purity of intention, integrity of conduct and dread of de&s;truction; with their propo&s;als for harmony and free intercour&s;e (on|ly); and their alarm of danger to his maje&s;ty's king|doms (by their a&s;&s;ociation) will &s;o awaken his fears, or excite his compa&s;&s;ion, as to procure the abolition of the&s;e acts, and his royal favor? Or, that our da|ring re&s;i&s;tance to law, and violence of a criminal na|ture, with our unlawful combinations, will be pa&s;&s;ed over with impunity?</P>
<P>Our affairs begin to wear a dangerous a&s;pect; the weapons of de&s;truction are prepared for action: And what horrors and di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t attend a civil war; where friends and relations are oppo&s;ed to each other. And it may not be ami&s;s for you to look back and con&s;ider how little regard has been paid to what our be&s;t advocates have &s;aid, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Farmer, Mr. Du|lancy, Lord Chatham, and others, with re&s;pect to our &s;ubordination to the parliament. "That the greater mu&s;t rule the latter, that we are but parts of the whole; and that the power of parliament may be ju&s;tly exerci&s;ed to pre&s;erve a &s;ubordination, and to re&s;train our trade and manufactures; and that the king, lords and commons, have power to pa&s;s a bill of attainder and take away our charter; and that their power is ab&s;olute and unaccountable. And that it is ju&s;t that every part of an empire, defended by its power, &s;hould bear a proportion of the charges according to their ability." Have we not di&s;regard|ed them, and all advice for moderate mea&s;ures, and acted in oppo&s;ition to the laws of our province, de|&s;troyed
<PB N="7" REF="014462_0006_0F92B106D29DB388">
private property, a&s;&s;aulted and abu&s;ed his maje&s;ty's liege &s;ubjects, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his courts of ju&s;|tice, and new formed his militia? And all on account of taxes laid upon us by the king and parliament, (for our proportion of the charges for national de|fence) and to keep up an oppo&s;ition to other acts of parliament, for &s;hutting up Bo&s;ton harbour, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that there can be no taxation without re|pre&s;entation, and that the demands for it were unpre|cedented, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ince 1763; which occa&s;ioned many polemical debates; not &s;o much with re&s;pect to the ju&s;tice of the demand, as about the legality of it. For Mr. Dulany &s;aid, that at the planting of the Colonies, protection and obedience were con&s;idered as reciprocal duties. I &s;hall further ob&s;erve, that the colony charters, granted under different kings, were of various forms. And that one large colony is ex|empt only from taxes, other than what are rai&s;ed by their own legi&s;lators, <HI>or by the parliament,</HI> but the times are &s;uch, that they al&s;o zealou&s;ly oppo&s;e all taxes by parliament. And of another colony it is &s;aid, that they are by charter exempt from all taxes, other than by their own legi&s;lators, and that by our province charter we have no exemption from taxes though &s;pecially apply'd for by our agents before it was granted; and that &s;en&s;ible of the omi&s;&s;ion, it was the earlie&s;t care of the province, to form and pa&s;s a bill of rights or prote&s;t again&s;t all taxes, other than what &s;hould be rai&s;ed by our legi&s;lators, which was not &s;o fortunate as to meet with their maje&s;ties ap|probation, and left room for after debates. And there are tho&s;e who &s;ay, that as the king cannot tax his &s;ubjects but by con&s;ent of parliament, &s;o neither can he emancipate them at his plea&s;ure from their proportion of the general charges of the nation. Whence you may ob&s;erve that the claim or right of
<PB N="8" REF="014462_0007_0F92B10795B66920">
taxation, is not novel or of &s;o late a date as &s;ome have &s;ugge&s;ted. But the &s;cene is now &s;o far chang|ed, that the legality or ju&s;tice of the demand, are not the only points under con&s;ideration; but whether, we &s;hall be &s;ubordinate to the parliament or not? I pre&s;ume that it is not yet too late for us who are to be actors in the conte&s;t, to &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider and determine with re&s;pect to a change of mea&s;ures; and the &s;everal duties of obedience, protection and gratitude for pa&s;t favors; and of benevolence to|ward fellow-&s;ubjects. And I hope the time will &s;oon come when our Revd. patriots will as a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly u&s;e the drum eccle&s;ia&s;tic, to enforce tho&s;e duties, as it has been for oppo&s;ition to government. And in order for your forming ju&s;t ideas of the &s;tate of the con|trover&s;y, I de&s;ire that you will from the following &s;tate of facts, duly con&s;ider, how far they lay us under an obligation to the performance of the&s;e duties.</P>

<P>THE Colonies long groaned under wars occa&s;i|oned by the French in Canada, which have been very expen&s;ive and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. It has been computed that in New-England only, more than ten thou&s;and of our be&s;t youths died in the&s;e wars; by the enemy, &s;ickne&s;s, &amp;c. And it al&s;o hinder'd our population, which at a common rate, might have doubled every twenty five years. For it is &s;aid that in 1762, our numbers had not doubled in forty years; and that in 1722, they had not in fifty years. And let us al&s;o look back and con&s;ider our fears and dangers about twenty one years ago, when we hum|bly pray'd for his Maje&s;ty's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as appears by repeated re&s;olves and addre&s;&s;es, &s;ome of which are as follows, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> one formed by the congre&s;s at Albany, July 9th 1754, when the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;aid, "That it was the evident de&s;ign of the French to &s;urround the Briti&s;h Colonies; and with a &s;trong naval force to make a general attack; and that there was the utmo&s;t danger that the whole continent would be &s;ubjected to the crown of France." And of the ad|dre&s;&s;es of our general a&s;&s;embly, and of our council, to Gov. Shirley, in 1754, when they with other com|plaints to the like effect, &s;aid, "The French have made &s;uch incroachments and taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as threaten great danger, and perhaps in time, even the de&s;truction of this province. And we apprehend it is impo&s;&s;ible in the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances of the province, to maintain a force nece&s;&s;ary for our defence; and therefore we humbly rely on his Ma|je&s;ty's paternal goodne&s;s, through the interpo&s;ition of you excellency's good offices for a&s;&s;i&s;tance." And what Virginia in the addre&s;s of their a&s;&s;embly to his
<PB N="10" REF="014462_0009_0F92B10E0D583E98">
Maje&s;ty &s;aid, "The de&s;igns of the French upon our frontiers, if not timely oppo&s;ed, mu&s;t be attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences; we have granted 10,000l for our defence, which though not &s;ufficient, is the utmo&s;t that out people are able to bear. We therefore mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to ex|tend your royal beneficence to us your loyal &s;ub|jects." Which &s;hews the language of poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Colonies, <HI>(though not of high and mighty &s;tates)</HI> and that we were then dependent on his Maje&s;ty's favor for protection. And &s;ince we are by his Ma|je&s;ty's gracious interpo&s;ition, made free from tho&s;e, or the like dangers or di&s;tre&s;&s;es, let us under a grate|ful &s;en&s;e of his favors and protection, and of our ex|emption from the &s;lavi&s;h yoke of Canada, but duly requite him for them; and further, con&s;ider that &s;ince Canada wars are ended, we may enjoy peace and quiet; and that our labourers may be better &s;up|ported by three days labour in a week, than the like labourers in England, by &s;ix days labour. And that we have already paid off our public debts; and that England has not been able to pay one tenth part of their's in the like term; and that their army and na|vy, do co&s;t annually, more than twice &s;o much as the land tax of England, at three &s;hilling on the pound; and that be&s;ides the va&s;t charges for the na|vy and army, and for emba&s;&s;adors, con&s;uls, &amp;c. (ge|neral charges) and of pen&s;ioners, &amp;c. England pays intere&s;t for &s;eventy millions that was due before the la&s;t war, and for more than &s;ixty millions expended by it: And that the la&s;t war was begun and the charges greatly increa&s;ed for our protection, and to &s;ettle the di&s;pute between our Colonies and Canada: Which may further lead us to con&s;ider, whether we have not been mi&s;led even to the brink of ruin; and whether we &s;hall yet &s;uffer tho&s;e who have &s;ought
<PB N="11" REF="014462_0010_0F92B10F2A735EE0">
popularity more than the good of their country (who&s;e cau&s;e is de&s;perate) to engage us, by delu&s;ive dreams and idle &s;ugge&s;tions to follow them down the precipice: And whether what our delegates in the continental congre&s;s called humble and rea&s;onable petitions from the Colonies, were not conceived in &s;uch terms as were affrontive to the King and parlia|ment, by a denial of their power, rather than &s;uch as were likely to promote an accommodation. War and blood&s;hed &s;eems now to be the unavoidable con|&s;equence of what are called violent proceedings&punc; and will not con&s;cious guilt &s;tare us in the face, if we &s;hall engage in oppo&s;ition to government before &s;atisfaction is made for the tea de&s;troyed, and for our protection. And let us u&s;e our influence every one in his &s;tation, to &s;uppre&s;s all violent mea&s;ures, and for promoting peace and good order, and a reconci|liation with our mother &s;tate of which we ought not to de&s;pair; for Mr. Burke, in his late addre&s;s to the city of Bri&s;tol, &s;aid, "That to reconcile Briti&s;h con|&s;titutional <HI>&s;uperiority</HI> with American <HI>liberty</HI> &s;hould be his endeavor to the utmo&s;t of his power in parlia|ment, which in his opinion might be pre&s;erved even yet: And that it was nece&s;&s;ary for both.</P>
<P>And let us con&s;ider, whether our honor in com|petition with that of Great-Britain, ought to take place; and whether it would have been an indignity to the Colonies, to have offered terms for adju&s;ting the di&s;pute.&mdash;I am not able to determine, how far we can &s;upport an oppo&s;ition to the King and par|liament; but thus much I may a&s;&s;ert, that if violent mea&s;ures &s;hall take place, our mighty &s;tates will &s;oon be ruined, by their power: Or can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that people in general will be &s;o infatuated as to de|pend on the extraordinary interpo&s;itions of divine providence in our favor. Let us rely on his Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="12" REF="014462_0011_0F92B10FD461D988">
favor; &s;en&s;ible of his benign di&s;po&s;itions on all oc|ca&s;ions; and e&s;pecially in the requi&s;ition, 1764. As appears by our agents letters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of April 4th.</NOTE> when the &s;tamp|act was &s;u&s;pended 'till the next year; to &s;ee if we would pa&s;t it our&s;elves, or &s;ome equivalent, which may encourage us to hope, that his de&s;igns were not formed in order to en&s;lave us, by a wanton ex|erci&s;e of power; but to lay upon us what was con|&s;idered, as a ju&s;t proportion of charges for our na|tional defence.&mdash;I have often heard tho&s;e who are zealous advocates for the Colonies, &s;ay, that it was ju&s;t, that we &s;hould pay for our protection; and that they would readily con&s;ent to it, if rai&s;ed in our own way; and trade might become free as heretofore: But cannot learn that any one of the Colonies did ever profe&s;s it, in their addre&s;&s;es.&mdash;I de&s;ire that we may no longer continue to act under the influence of &s;uch mean and ungenerous principles; and wil|lingly &s;ubmit to pay our ju&s;t proportion. The Co|lonies have lately given a pompous account of their numbers, but are they able to pay one thirtieth part of the general charges of the nation? if they are, it is more then what was expected by the requi&s;ition.</P>
<P>I fear that it is now too late, for us to form pro|po&s;als to his Maje&s;ty and the parliament, &s;oon enough to prevent the &s;pirited exertions of their power over us: And from the violent temper and ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions of our people, we may ju&s;tly fear the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences.&mdash;However, I think it ad|vi&s;eable, as our all is at &s;take; for tho&s;e who are of true patriotic principles, to &s;tand forth for the &s;alva|tion of their country; and freely declare their &s;enti|ments, before it is too late; without any regard to the deluded populate. Our pre&s;ent dangers ought to obliterate all party prejudices and di&s;tinctions, and
<PB N="13" REF="014462_0012_0F92B1109AD5C810">
unite in mea&s;ures that are mo&s;t for our common: &s;afety; which may be, by an application to his Excellency General Gage, our commander in chief, for his favour, by moderate mea&s;ures; and for his kind interpo&s;ition, with the King and parlia|ment, in our behalf. And as by the la&s;t accounts from Great-Britain, we are informed that the affairs of the Colonies, were to come before the King and parliament &s;oon; whereby they may as is &s;uppo&s;ed, form a con&s;titutional plan for the Colonies; which may require our utmo&s;t moderation and prudence; therefore let us exert our &s;everal powers and faculties, in order to form favorable and ju&s;t &s;entiments of go|vernment, and for promoting a decent acquie&s;cence with any tolerable requi&s;itions; hoping in his Ma|je&s;ty's favor for a redre&s;s of all grievances afterward, when we can act in a con&s;titutional way, by proper addre&s;&s;es: And as our &s;ea-port towns are expo&s;ed to the King's naval forces, and in danger of de&s;truction by fire and &s;word; and that it is expected, that a neutrality will be demanded of them: They may therefore con&s;ider, whether it would not (if required) be be&s;t for them to &s;ubmit to it, for their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>And is it not to be expected, that there are great numbers in other parts of the province, who have conformed to popular mea&s;ures, that will not be active in an oppo&s;ition to government, who will readily embrace the fir&s;t favorable opportunity to &s;ecure them&s;elves by a neutrality or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and leave the conte&s;t to tho&s;e, who will not &s;ubmit; and I de&s;ire that it may be further con&s;idered, whether the controver&s;y, and duties for ten years pa&s;t, has not been more expen&s;ive to us, then it would have been, if we had attended to the requi&s;ition, and offered to grant a certain annual revenue to his Maje&s;ty, when they were inclined to &s;tipulate, and
<PB N="14" REF="014462_0013_0F92B11153879A70">
accept a moderate allowance. We have imprudently rejected the propo&s;als, and relied on the influence and exertions of the manufacturing party in England for &s;afety; but can we now depend upon them to &s;ecure or pre&s;erve us from ruin; I hope you will con&s;ider the importance of the &s;ubject, and excu&s;e my officious endeavors, that were excited by a view of &s;uch intere&s;ting concerns: I have engaged in it, not from private views, or with per&s;onal prejudice to any one; but with a &s;incere de&s;ire to promote the good of the public. It is the undue practices only, of a party, that I mean to expo&s;e&mdash;I have endea|vored to promote a ju&s;t regard for &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary duties of &s;ocial life; and &s;hould have given it &s;ooner with my &s;tate of facts and remarks, had I not feared that it would appear unpopular, and be treated with &s;neers and ridicule. But &s;en&s;ible of our extreme danger, I have under a con&s;cious regard to my duty, overcome &s;uch fears, and do con&s;ider tar and feathers, and the favors of the populace, to be of little avail, if compared to the pre&s;ervation of my country, and the lives of my dear countrymen; of which there are many thou&s;ands (as I doubt not) who are ju&s;t and hone&s;t in their intentions, that would have acted a different part, if they had known the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e.&mdash;And I fear that my relation of facts and plain-dealing may occa&s;ion &s;ome &s;crupulous per&s;ons, to mi&s;apprehend my de&s;igns, and conclude that I am a tory. But I hereby declare, that I am in no wi&s;e &s;en&s;ible, that I have offered any thing in|con&s;i&s;tent, with true and genuine whig principles: And I &s;hall therefore take the liberty to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf.</P>
