<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR BRETHREN IN THE LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I<HI>T was at your pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tance, that I preached this Sermon. It is at the &s;ame pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tance, that I con|&s;ent to its Publication. I had many more Things wrote down in my Notes than I delivered. The Weather, you know, was hot, and my State of Health but indifferent. It would have pained both me and the Audience to have made a long Sermon. I have therefore in&s;erted &s;ome Things that were not delivered, but have taken Care to in&s;ert none, but &s;uch as will explain the &s;everal important Points of Be|lief and Practice, that were then laid before, and pre&s;&s;ed upon, my Hearers. The Manner in which the Text is treated is not to be got in the modern fa&s;hionable Sy&s;tems of Divinity; but it is, and always has been, in the Heart of every pious Believer of the ble&s;&s;ed Incarnation. The&s;e Per|&s;ons are no Strangers to what is here &s;aid; but will cheer|fully a&s;&s;ent to, and be delighted therewith. But where the Heart has not received, nor is &s;en&s;ible of, this ble&s;&s;ed Incar|nation,&mdash;there, I expect Rebuke and Cen&s;ure. Be it &s;o.
<PB N="iv" REF="011412_0003_0F832DF8D78DC900">
Let it produce no Ill-will, nor angry Contention. Let us not enter into Di&s;putation about Terms. If the&s;e Cen&s;urers are &s;incerely de&s;irous to know the Truth, and will apply for it, where it only can be had, in and from Chri&s;t Je&s;us, they will from him learn Meekne&s;s; and as &s;oon as they have received this Grace from their Saviour, the Glory, as it is here de&s;cribed, will not &s;tay long after, and then, they will po&s;&s;e&s;s the Thing. It makes no Difference in the Thing it&s;elf by what Name they call it, nor how they imagine it comes into their Hearts&mdash;whether with or at their Birth&mdash;or in their Bapti&s;m,&mdash;whether with or without a Per&s;on's Pre|de&s;tination and Election,&mdash;or whether, and how far they think, their own Will is concerned in it. God's Manner of conveying Grace and Power into the Heart, leaves no Room for &s;uch Que&s;tions as the&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Scripture gives this plain Account of the Proce&s;s of Salvation in every one; namely, the Seed of the Woman&mdash;the Seed of Abraham&mdash;the Seed of David&mdash;and the Seed that was by the Conception of the Holy Gho&s;t in the Body of the Virgin Mary&mdash;opened it&s;elf in the Body of Chri&s;t, ("a Body ha&s;t thou prepared for me: Then &s;aid I, Lo! I come"&mdash;) and there grew up to its full Perfection of Glory, and is now a perfect God-man, &s;itting at the right Hand of God in Heaven, and helping us, who have, one as well as another, a Seed within us after its Kind, to go through our Trial here on Earth, and when this is done, to attain our Body of Glory in Heaven. In this Faith let us live and die; and
<PB N="v" REF="011412_0004_0F832DF9975841E0">
let us publicly declare that this Faith is not a Matter of Opinion, or any Thing that will bear a Di&s;pute, but is a &s;elf-evident Manife&s;tation made in the Heart by Chri&s;t him|&s;elf coming there, with his Kingdom of Heaven and the Glory that he had with the Father from the Beginning, agreeable to his own Declaration and Promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>O righteous Father! the World hath not known thee: But I have known thee; and the&s;e have known that thou ha&s;t &s;ent me. And I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it, that the Love, wherewith thou ha&s;t loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</HI></Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR FELLOW-CHRISTIANS OF THIS EVANGELICAL CHURCH,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MAY the God of all Grace, who hath called us to his eternal Glory by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, make you perfect in your Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e, &s;tabli&s;h, &s;trengthen, &s;ettle you!</P>
<P>Your Invitation to the Mini&s;ters and Members of the Epi&s;copal Church, to mix their Devotions with yours, and to partake of the Joy you mu&s;t needs feel on bring|ing this large Building to &s;uch an admired and a&s;toni&s;h|ing Perfection, fills us with an high Sen&s;e of your Bro|therly Love to us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. It reminds us of the Love and tender Affection which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Churches, and which makes &s;o large and delightful a Part of the Apo&s;tolic Epi&s;tles recorded in Scripture. All tho&s;e numerous Congregations, which in divers and di&s;tant Parts, and under various Forms of
<PB N="8" REF="011412_0006_0F832DFC798F3AC0">
Divine Wor&s;hip, were brought together by the Apo&s;tles and fir&s;t Preachers of the Go&s;pel, had nothing afflictive or joyous in their Affairs, but what they were all alike Sharers in. As often as Occa&s;ion called them to di&s;tant Places, they went with the utmo&s;t Cheerfulne&s;s into one anothers Churches; and joined together in Communion of Prayer and Exhortation. And is it not much to be lamented, that the &s;ame affectionate Intercour&s;e does not prevail now? Do we not all wor&s;hip the one God and Father of All&mdash;the one Son and Redeemer of All&mdash;the one Holy Gho&s;t and Sanctifier of All? What though Churches are built in different Forms; what though Mini&s;ters wear different Habits; what though every national Church has a different Mode of Expre&s;|&s;ion in the Compilement of their Articles and Prayers&mdash;has not Chri&s;t Je&s;us provided one and the &s;ame &s;trong Coment of Love and Charity, to tie and keep all the&s;e his different Members together? Should the&s;e Differ|ences be Rea&s;ons for Enmity, Di&s;tance, or &s;eparate In|tere&s;ts?&mdash;What does the Spirit of Chri&s;t &s;ay to us all on this Occa&s;ion? <Q>As the Body is one, and hath many Members, and all the Members of the one Body, be|ing many, are one Body, &s;o al&s;o is Chri&s;t; for by one Spirit are we all bapti&s;ed into one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</Q> We heartily wi&s;h this Union of Hearts, this Commu|nion
<PB N="9" REF="011412_0007_0F832DFCDA6EB558">
of affectionate Intercour&s;e, was general among Prote&s;tant Churches: And we have a very &s;en&s;ible Plea|&s;ure in being able publicly to declare, that between your Church, the Swedi&s;h Church, and our own Epi&s;copal Church, there has always been, from the very fir&s;t, a kind and loving Participation of Divine Service and Brotherly Offices. May the good God ble&s;s this di&s;intere&s;ted friend|ly Union! and may we all u&s;e our own earne&s;t Endea|vours to in&s;pire the &s;ame Zeal into our Children, that we may for-ever continue in the &s;incere Love of one ano|ther, and in an open undi&s;gui&s;ed Participation of Wor|&s;hip and In&s;truction!&mdash;And there is good Rea&s;on why it &s;hould be &s;o: Becau&s;e, if we will only look into our Liturgies, Church-Offices, and Articles of Religion, we &s;hall find &s;o near a Re&s;emblance, as may well entitle us to the Name of Si&s;ter-Churches. In &s;ome Things we do differ; and with an hone&s;t open Freedom let each of us give its own the Preference. We may do it &s;afely, and perfectly agreeable to the Spirit with which both Churches e&s;tabli&s;hed their own particular Con&s;titutions. Our Pray|ers breathe one and the &s;ame primitive Apo&s;tolical Piety, the &s;ame impartial univer&s;al Love. Holding the&s;e, why not differ from one another in &s;ome Points? And what hinders any of us from declaring, as I do at pre&s;ent, that upon the &s;ame virtuous Principles, that any one Man loves, e&s;teems, and prefers his own Church, &s;o any other Per&s;on may love and prefer his Church likewi&s;e; and all of us may, and ought, however we differ in Articles and
<PB N="10" REF="011412_0008_0F832DFD63236C20">
Modes of Wor&s;hip, to hold a loving Intercour&s;e with, and do good to one another.</P>
<P>Having thus expre&s;&s;ed my hone&s;t and &s;incere Pre|ference to my own Church, my general Love to all Prote&s;tant Churches, and my particular Regard to this Evangelical Church&mdash;let us now turn our Meditations to the Church of God in Heaven, where there is no Dif|ference in Judgment, nor any Abatement of Charity. The Holy Angels, we hope, are here pre&s;ent, and feel a &s;en&s;ible Delight at the Opening of this and of every other Prote&s;tant Church. <Q>If, as our Saviour &s;ays, there is Joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repent|eth,</Q> as we may have an humble Confidence that this Church will be the Means of bringing many Sinners to Repentance; &s;o the&s;e Angels cannot but be partaking of the pious Joy which fills every Brea&s;t on the Commence|ment of Divine Service in this beautiful Temple. And were the Angels at this Juncture to make their per&s;onal Appearance, (as Chri&s;t is with them, as well as with us, "All in All") they could give no ampler Te&s;timony to his e&s;&s;ential Glory and Divine Nature, nor to the Merits, Ble&s;&s;ings, Extent and Character of his holy Religion, than they gave at his Incarnation, thus expre&s;&s;ed by St. LUKE, <Q>And &s;uddenly there was with the Angel a Multitude of the Heavenly Ho&s;t prai&s;ing God, and &s;aying, Glory to God in the Highe&s;t, and on Earth Peace, Good-will towards Men.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011412_0009_0F832DFE15D157A8">
Hence it appears, my dear Fellow-Wor&s;hippers, that Chri&s;t's Religion, founded, as it wholly is, on his Incar|nation, makes every Man an Angel, and, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, every Angel a Man. It unites Heaven and Earth. By it Angels enter into all our Concerns, and become Mini&s;ters of God to us in every Thing relative to our Salvation: And by it we can without Pre&s;umption boa&s;t, that we are Fellow-Citizens with the holy Angels, and of the Hou&s;hold of God. One Nature&mdash;One Life&mdash;One Spirit&mdash;One Will with Angels&mdash;Oh! What a ble&s;&s;ed Inter-Community is this?&mdash;How repeatedly re|vealed?&mdash;And upon what a firm Foundation e&s;tabli&s;h|ed?&mdash;Do not your Hearts feel an Enlargement, that reaches to the Throne of God? Are you not by behold|ing your Face in Chri&s;t Je&s;us&mdash;you in him, and he in you&mdash;changed from Glory to Glory, till you &s;ee no other Difference between your&s;elves and the holy Angels than this&mdash;they are already made perfect, and have their Con|&s;ummation and Bli&s;s&mdash;You are but Beginners in Glory, but proceeding, through your Union in Chri&s;t, from Step to Step, till you reach, if not exceed, the Stature of the highe&s;t Cherub and Seraph.</P>
<P>And that I may make you &s;en&s;ible of this your Im|portance in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, I be&s;eech you to enter with me into the Con&s;ideration of the Divine Service and Wor|&s;hip, which the&s;e holy Angels performed to God; the fir&s;t &s;olemn Wor&s;hip that was performed at, and on Ac|count
<PB N="12" REF="011412_0010_0F832DFF68FDE968">
of, the ble&s;&s;ed Incarnation of Chri&s;t.&mdash;Let us de|voutly examine the Ground and Foundation, the Rea|&s;on and the Motive of their Wor&s;hip. Let us look into the Temple of their Hearts, &s;ee what it was, that was &s;tirring there, and in what Po&s;ture they &s;tood; that we may learn, when we come into this or any other Church, how to wor&s;hip God rightly, and to put our&s;elves into a proper Po&s;ture both of Soul and Body. You &s;ee the Subject. Let us divide it properly, that you may have a di&s;tinct Notion of it.</P>
<P>I. It is, fir&s;t, to &s;hew you the true and full Ground and Foundation, together with the true Rea&s;on and Motive, of this angelic Wor&s;hip addre&s;&s;ed to our Savi|our at his Incarnation:</P>
<P>II. It is to &s;hew what was their Po&s;ture, and what was in their Hearts, when they &s;ounded forth this hea|venly Hymn, that we may learn, when we enter into this or any other Church, to &s;tand in the &s;ame Po&s;ture:</P>
<P>III. As all that which &s;tirred up the&s;e heavenly Strains of Divine Wor&s;hip in the Brea&s;ts of the Angels, is by Chri&s;t's Incarnation in you, and in every Man in the World, (&s;ince you may all prai&s;e God as the&s;e An|gels did, and for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, and with the &s;ame Truth) I &s;hall mo&s;t earne&s;tly pre&s;s you to call it forth into the &s;ame &s;piritual and heavenly exerci&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011412_0011_0F832DFFE21F84F8">
<Q>And there appeared with the Angel a Multitude of the Heavenly Ho&s;t prai&s;ing God, and &s;aying, GLO|RY to GOD in the Highe&s;t&mdash;On Earth PEACE,&mdash;GOOD-WILL towards Men.</Q></P>
<P>This, then, is the Triune Ground of their Wor&s;hip&mdash;GLORY&mdash;PEACE&mdash;GOOD-WILL.&mdash;What a rich Ground is here, out of which the Wor&s;hip of the&s;e Angels aro&s;e? The&s;e three Things are the eternal Repre&s;entations and Symbols of the Triune God, Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t. GLORY belongs to the FATHER&mdash;PEACE and RECONCILIATION to the SON&mdash;GOOD-WILL, or a Will to all Goodne&s;s, to the HOLY GHOST. Let us &s;peak of all the&s;e di&s;tinctly, and in their Order.</P>
<P>GLORY has its Source in the Mo&s;t High God. There is its Center&mdash;there is its Circumference. It makes the Heaven of Heavens. It is the Outflowing of the Unity of God&punc; It is the Father's fir&s;t and mo&s;t perfect Manife&s;tation. Out of this Original come all the Glances and Cheerfulne&s;s that we &s;ee in our own Light, when the Sky is in its mo&s;t &s;erene and pure State and Temperament. To be in Glory is to be in God. When God puts his Glory into Men's Hearts, he gives them him&s;elf. The&s;e Angels, &s;en&s;ible, that all their Glory, both inward and outward, is continually received by fre&s;h and fre&s;h Supplies, out of and from God, acknowledge it in this Hymn; and &s;uch Acknowledgement made
<PB N="14" REF="011412_0012_0F832E005BEE2D50">
humbly and thankfully, and continually, with a true Devotion and Love of Heart, is all the Glory and Wor|&s;hip, that the highe&s;t Angel can give to God; namely, owning, that all he is, and has, and does, is from God alone, and that he has no original per&s;onal Glory of his own, but that it is all derived&mdash;All is God in him, and he in God.</P>
<P>But what was the particular Rea&s;on and Cau&s;e of this pre&s;ent Adoration? Did this Fountain of Glory break out in any particular Place? Had it a&s;&s;umed any new Form? Was it come into any new Temple, that it &s;hould require a new Addre&s;s, a new Act of Adoration and Wor&s;hip? Yes, yes, my dear Hearers,&mdash;This, that the&s;e Angels &s;aw, was a new Thing. They now for the fir&s;t Time &s;aw this Glory in its full Brightne&s;s, infinitely exceeding in Lu&s;tre that which &s;hone in them&s;elves&mdash;They &s;aw it blazing out of the Heart of the Son of God&mdash;They &s;aw it incarnated in the Infant Je&s;us&mdash;All that Glory, which filled the very high Place of their Re&s;idence&mdash;all that Glory that formed the Shechinah in the Holy of Holies&mdash;was come down upon Earth, and had brought it&s;elf into the Brea&s;t of a little Child. This was the Rea&s;on of the Appearance of a Multitude of Angels, that the Shepherds might &s;ee before-hand that Glory about the Angels, which they &s;hould behold en|circling the new-born Babe. What a &s;elf-evident Proof was this to the Shepherds of the Divinity of this Infant?
<PB N="15" REF="011412_0013_0F832E0118F1A690">
They were not left to the Inferences of Rea&s;on&mdash;to the Application of Prophecies&mdash;but to the Evidence of their Sen&s;es; &s;ince the very Glory that &s;hone round the&s;e An|gels, they would find &s;hining in the very &s;ame Manner about the Babe that was lying in the Manger.&mdash;This Glory, then, was the true heavenly Sign, &s;o much &s;poken of in the Law and the Prophets, by which not only the&s;e Shepherds &s;hould know for certain the Birth and Per&s;on of their Saviour, but all the devout Men in I&s;ra|el, who had waited for the Me&s;&s;iah, &s;hould likewi&s;e be favoured with the &s;ame Certainty, &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ame Glory, and &s;o with old Simeon, ble&s;s God, that they had even before their Death the Satisfaction of &s;eeing the "Lord's Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>Behold in this Vi&s;it of the Angels, and its Con&s;e|quences, (and admire and adore the eternal Truth of God for it!) a full and &s;atisfactory Proof of the Ac|compli&s;hment of all tho&s;e Prophecies, which &s;peak of the Glory of God as a &s;pecific Excellence in the Chri&s;|tian Di&s;pen&s;ation! Behold this great Go&s;pel Truth brought Home to the Sen&s;es of all the pious People among the Jews; namely, that the Glory of the &s;econd Temple infinitely exceeded the Glory of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. But then, &s;econdly, the Angels, not only wor&s;hip|ped this Glory as an Heaven manife&s;ted within the Body of the Infant; but they wor&s;hipped it on a View of the
<PB N="16" REF="011412_0014_0F832E01F11EE3E0">
Effects it &s;hould work on Earth, even, UNIVERSAL PEACE AND RECONCILIATION. Behold here it became a new Center, a new Source, a new Creation, which was to cover the Earth, as the Waters cover the Seas, and to be poured over all Fle&s;h. It was to &s;pread all over the fal|len World, and, where-ever it came, it was to redeem, &s;ave, purify, clean&s;e and pacify all the di&s;turbed Ele|ments of Nature. It was to be a Fountain of new Blood in the Veins of all the corrupted Sons of Adam. It was with the Meekne&s;s of the Lamb to take away all the Sins of the World, to turn the angry, fretful, proud, envious Pa&s;&s;ions of Men into Gentlene&s;s, Sweetne&s;s and delightful Joy. In &s;hort, it was to bring every &s;inful Soul into Temperature, Harmony, Equality and Peace. It was in Heaven the GLORY of the Father, and from thence the&s;e Angels wor&s;hipped him as the GOD of GLORY. Now that it was in the Son, and was become in him the Brightne&s;s of the Father's Glory, it was right|ly called on Earth PEACE: For wherever it &s;hould enter, it would re&s;tore Peace, and bring every Thing into its original REST and SABBATISM. <HI>"There remaineth yet a Re&s;t for the People of God."</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. God and Man thus reconciled, this Glory con|ceived, and a&s;&s;umed its la&s;t and mo&s;t perfect Form, even a Spirit of univer&s;al Love, which is the third Object of the Divine Wor&s;hip paid by the&s;e Angels, namely, "GOOD-WILL TOWARDS MEN."&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="011412_0015_0F832E02AAC55B28">
For in and out of this Brightne&s;s of Glory &s;hining in the Heart of this new-born Babe, the&s;e Angels &s;aw and wor&s;hipped a PROCEEDING WILL AND SPIRIT&mdash;the Spirit of Love,&mdash;an eternal and unchangeable Will to all Goodne&s;s, Happine&s;s and Perfection, even the HO|LY GHOST him&s;elf, here called GOOD-WILL TOWARDS MEN; becau&s;e this Spirit was to de&s;cend into, and be|come the Leader and Guide of all the Hearts of Men. It was to regulate their Human Fire as a &s;acred Tincture, an Holy Oil, a divine Breath, and heavenly Bapti&s;m, breathing through and purifying all Human Nature, &s;anctifying and glorifying all the Children of Men. The&s;e Angels wor&s;hipped this GOD THE HOLY GHOST, as doing his perfecting Offices fir&s;t in the Body of JESUS CHRIST, and, in and by him, in the Body of every Man in the World, who would receive his In&s;piration.</P>
<P>Having &s;hewn this Wor&s;hip in its Three-fold Di&s;tinc|tion of GLORY, PEACE and GOOD-WILL; let us attend to what is further &s;aid in Holy Writ upon this Subject, that we may be more and more convinced of the Rea|&s;ons and Motives of this particular Act of Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the P&s;alms and in the Prophets, GOD foretold, that, whenever he &s;hould bring his Fir&s;t-born into this lower World, there, as well as in Heaven "all the An|gels &s;hould wor&s;hip him." Accordingly, the HOLY JE|SUS was no &s;ooner born, but the Angels were convened
<PB N="18" REF="011412_0016_0F832E035969D048">
to render him that Homage, which was &s;o particularly foretold. One Angel might have &s;ufficed to announce to the whole World the Birth of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, ju&s;t as GABRIEL alone was &s;ent to the VIRGIN MARY to apprize her of the Honour intended her. But the Matter had been otherwi&s;e planned,&mdash;and therefore there was <Q>with the Angel a Multitude of the hea|venly Ho&s;t prai&s;ing God and &s;aying, GLORY to GOD in the Highe&s;t, and on Earth PEACE, GOOD-WILL towards Men.</Q></P>
<P>In this &s;upernatural Convention of Angels, on this particular Occa&s;ion, another Matter was brought about, <Q>even the MYSTERY, which, St. Paul &s;ays, was hid from the Beginning of the World in GOD, who created all Things by JESUS CHRIST, to the Intent that un|to the Principalities and Powers in heavenly Places might be known by the Church the manifold Wi&s;dom of GOD according to the eternal Purpo&s;e, which he purpo&s;ed in CHRIST JESUS.</Q> Thus the&s;e Angels beheld in the Incarnation of JESUS CHRIST what they did not know before, and what, as ST. PETER &s;ays, "they had earne&s;tly de&s;ired to look into," namely, the Source of their own Birth. They did not de&s;ire to know this from &s;uch a Temper as SATAN did, who, from Pride, longed to find out his fir&s;t Forms, think|ing that he &s;hould di&s;cover &s;omething there, that would render him independent of GOD&mdash;No, No&mdash;. The&s;e An|gels
<PB N="19" REF="011412_0017_0F832E0414B1C678">
were of a very different Temper. They had been pre&s;ent, when the Spirit of Prophecy, mentioning CHRIST, had predicted things in which they were to be as much concerned as the Sons of Men. It was the&s;e partial In|timations given from Time to Time by the SPIRIT OF GOD, that occa&s;ioned their Curio&s;ity and earne&s;t De&s;ire, as ST. PETER &s;ays, to know the Sufferings of CHRIST, and the Glory that &s;hould follow. Here then fir&s;t at this ble&s;&s;ed Incarnation, the&s;e Angels &s;aw, that the WORD now become incarnate, this pre&s;ent SON OF GOD begin|ing to be a SON OF MAN, was and is the Creator of An|gels as well as of Men: And that all Things both in Heaven and Earth were made by him, and that not a &s;ingle thing of all that was made, was made without him; that He only was in the Beginning, GOD IN GOD, GOD OF GOD; and that they, together with their Hea|ven, the eternal Seat of the Divine Pre&s;ence were all after and from this JESUS: And therefore they wor&s;hip|ped CHRIST from a Sen&s;e, that he was ju&s;t as much their Creator and Maker and Former&mdash;ju&s;t as much their Strength and Glory and Life,&mdash;(and that this was like|wi&s;e the Ca&s;e with Re&s;pect to all other Principalities, Dominions and Thrones in Heaven) as he was now by his Incarnation declared to be, and to have been, from all Eternity the Reconciliation and Peace and Salvation of fallen Man.</P>
<P>Learn, therefore, O ye Sons of Men, from this
<PB N="20" REF="011412_0018_0F832E04F2FF30E8">
plain Pa&s;&s;age of Scripture, which manife&s;tly includes in it all that hath been here &s;aid of CHRIST: That in all the Nature of Things both in Heaven and Earth, there was none that could bring Salvation to fallen Man, but this SON of GOD&mdash;that as GOD had created Man at fir&s;t by his SON, this SON could only be his RE|DEEMER. If CHRIST had not been the Creator of An|gels, their Wor&s;hip had been Idolatry. And if CHRIST had not been the CREATOR as well as REDEEMER of Man, the Wor&s;hip performed to him in all Chri&s;tian Churches is likewi&s;e rank Idolatry.</P>
<P>Thus have I, with a Copiou&s;ne&s;s which the Subject required, and which Scripture amply furni&s;hes, fini&s;hed my fir&s;t Head.</P>
<P>II. Let me now proceed to my &s;econd general Head, and &s;hew in what Po&s;ture the&s;e Angels &s;tood, that is to &s;ay, what that Spirit was, which in them &s;ounded forth this Divine Hymn; that we may learn, when we enter into this or any other Church, to put our&s;elves into the &s;ame Po&s;ture.</P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid it appears that there nei|ther is nor can be &s;uch a Thing as Selfi&s;hne&s;s, or Self-Will, Self-Love or Self-E&s;teem in Heaven. Such a Fal&s;hood could never take Place, 'till the fir&s;t Union be|tween GOD and the Creature was broken. 'Till then
<PB N="21" REF="011412_0019_0F832E059D48CBB0">
the Creature could not acquire an Idea or Sen&s;ibility of Self. For we &s;ee here by the Account which Scripture gives of our Creation in CHRIST JESUS, that the fir&s;t Be|ginning of our Creation is in and out of JESUS CHRIST. It is not in and out of Nothing, but in and out of JESUS CHRIST, who, being the Fullne&s;s of the Godhead, and having all the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge in him, brought the &s;ame Powers that were in him&s;elf into the fir&s;t created man. Now what did ADAM do? What did the&s;e Angels do to help forward this creating Work? Or what &s;hare of Power had they in the forming them|&s;elves?&mdash;None at all.&mdash;Their Capacity of receiving Happine&s;s was from GOD. The Happine&s;s they did receive was likewi&s;e from GOD. <Q>He openeth his Hand and filleth all Things living with Plenteou&s;|ne&s;s.</Q> He in&s;pires his own Likene&s;s and the Love of his own Goodne&s;s. The whole Image and Similitude of GOD was, in the&s;e Angels and this Adam, antece|dent to every outward Work or Action that proceeded from them.&mdash;Now what was, what could be in the Hearts of Beings thus made, and perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that they were thus made&mdash;perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that they had nothing of their Happine&s;s either from them&s;elves, or from one another, but that their All was from GOD? Could their Adoration be any Thing el&s;e but their Feel|ing&mdash;their Sen&s;ibility of that, which GOD was always doing in them and to them? And could it produce any Thing el&s;e but an Union of Hearts, an united
<PB N="22" REF="011412_0020_0F832E06596488B8">
Splendor of heavenly FIRE, LIGHT and LOVE: GOD in the Angels&mdash;and the Angels in GOD. The whole Heavens and Eternal Nature on this Occa&s;ion came into View, and were a Temple of Love, and every Angel's Heart was a living &s;eparate Apartment therein. CHRIST was the HIGH-PRIEST with the URIM and THUMMIM of MAJESTY and PERFECTION on his Brea&s;t, and the HOLY GHOST was the &s;acred Oyl, the Frankincen&s;e and &s;weet-&s;melling Odour that filled the whole Temple with Aromatic Fragrance: <Q>All thy Garments &s;mell of Myrrh, Aloes and Ca&s;&s;ia.</Q> When the&s;e Angels turned their Countenances towards one another, as every Heart glowed with one and the &s;ame Divine Fire, the Flames of Love came forth&mdash;contracted like a Magnet, and brought all together&mdash;It made but one Pyramid of Ma|je&s;ty, and Light and Love. What a Tran&s;cendency of Happine&s;s is there in this Angelic Po&s;ture? Was it po&s;&s;ible, think you, that the&s;e Angels could receive an In|crea&s;e of GLORY or GOOD-WILL?&mdash;Yes&mdash;Yes&mdash;Our SA|VIOUR, who alone felt the highe&s;t Degree of Joy that could be rai&s;ed on any Occa&s;ion, &s;hews <HI>us,</HI> how the&s;e Angels might find them&s;elves in an higher Degree of Sen&s;ibility, than they had ever before experienced. Hear the Lip of Truth it&s;elf!&mdash;<Q>There is Joy among the Angels in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth more than over Ninety and Nine ju&s;t Per|&s;ons who need no Repentance.</Q>&mdash;You may ea&s;ily conceive then, that if this was the Ca&s;e as to a &s;ingle

Sinner, there mu&s;t needs have been an Exuberance, an Efferve&s;cence of Joy at the endearing Pro&s;pect, which this Ble&s;&s;ed Incarnation afforded of Salvation to a whole World of fallen Sinners. Surely, &s;urely the Gla&s;s of Eternal Wi&s;dom would at this Time be held up to the&s;e Angels, in which FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST were delighting them&s;elves with the A&s;pects of Thou&s;ands and Thou&s;ands of lo&s;t and undone Sinners, that from the North and from the South, from the Ea&s;t and from the We&s;t, <HI>now</HI> happily redeemed and enlarged, were crowding in &s;uch Numbers and with &s;uch an holy Vehe|mence and Ardour into the Courts of Light, that <Q>the Kingdom of Heaven it&s;elf &s;uffered Violence.</Q></P>
<P>Attend, then, to the Po&s;ture of the&s;e Angels!&mdash;If they looked towards GOD, there was the Triune Ma|je&s;ty of Love&mdash;if towards one another, there it was in full Communication &s;pringing forth as the Glance of a Firmament without them, and within them taking a particular Seat in every one of their Hearts, and bring|ing with it their natural Bodies of Glory.&mdash;If they look|ed towards the Earth, the &s;ame Streams of Happine&s;s were &s;preading them&s;elves all over its Surface, gliding at the &s;ame Time into every Human Heart, that felt the Power of its Redemption. Language they could have none: For &s;uch Love as this is above all Lan|guage. They could do nothing but repeat a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and Times this one Song of Prai&s;e: <Q>GLO|RY

<P>III. As all that which &s;tirred up the&s;e heavenly Strains of Divine Wor&s;hip in the Brea&s;ts of the&s;e Angels is, by CHRIST's Incarnation, in you and every Man in the World, &s;ince you may all prai&s;e GOD as the&s;e An|gels did, and for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, and with the &s;ame Truth, I &s;hall now, in the la&s;t Place, mo&s;t earne&s;tly pre&s;s you to call it forth into the &s;ame &s;piritual and heavenly Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ily &s;aid, that &s;uch high Powers are in Man; (and if in one Man, then in every Man, for "with GOD there is no Re&s;pect or Di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons") but how is this proved? For &s;urely no Man, that is once per|&s;uaded of this Truth will be &s;o unju&s;t to him&s;elf, as not to tru&s;t entirely to them, and quit all Sy&s;tems of Divinity, which fall &s;hort of the&s;e Powers, as inade|quate to the ju&s;t Demands of a rational Religion. CHRISTIANITY makes but one Preten&s;ion, and that is, to &s;ave Man from Death, and to help him to Life. <Q>In ADAM all die:&mdash;In CHRIST &s;hall all be made alive.</Q> Our SAVIOUR, ju&s;t as he was going to a&s;cend into Hea|ven, after he had fini&s;hed all that Part of our Redemp|tion that could be done on Earth, gives his Di&s;ciples a &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion to go and convert all the World to his Religion. The Form is &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of what

<Q>The&s;e Words &s;pake JESUS, and lift up his Eyes to Heaven, and &s;aid, FATHER, the Hour is come; glo|rify thy SON, that thy SON al&s;o may glorify thee.

And this is Life Eternal, that they might know thee the only true GOD, and JESUS CHRIST whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent. I have glorified thee on the Earth: I have fini&s;hed the Work, which thou gave&s;t me to do. And now, O FATHER, glorify thou me with thine own Self, with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was. I have manife&s;ted thy Name unto the Men which thou gave&s;t me out of the World: Thine they were, and thou gave&s;t them me; and they have kept thy Word. Now they have known, that all Things what&s;oever thou ha&s;t given me, are of thee.

This is the Foundation, Ground and Rea&s;on why, with the Scripture, I declare to you, that you have all the &s;ame Powers, and can with the &s;ame Truth of Nature &s;ing forth the &s;ame Prai&s;es, as the&s;e Angels did: And, therefore, as much as Eternity is pre|ferable to Time, as much as heavenly Powers &s;urpa&s;s earthly Powers, with an Ardour proportionable to this great Difference, I be&s;eech you to turn to your incarnate SAVIOUR. In and through him you have in you all that which is in the&s;e Holy Angels.

of the&s;e Angels. I &s;ay as every other Thing in Nature does; for between the Growth of our heavenly and earthly Powers and Graces, there is an exact Simili|tude. Look at the Root of the Lily, or any other Flower, it will &s;hew you your own Nature and Powers&mdash;how they may lie dormant, and how they come to be quickened again to Life. When the Root of a Lily or Ro&s;e, or any other Flower, is in a Drawer, or in the frozen Ground, in the Middle of an hard Winter, it has in it, even in this State of Death and Inactivity, all that which makes its Beauty and &s;weet Smell when it comes to blow in the Summer. The Sun, it is true, brings forth all this into it, but the Sun does not give it its Nature; this was in it at all Times, and as much when it lay in the Drawer as when the Sun is operating upon it with its Summer Heat. For if it had not the Peculiarity of the Lily in its Nature, the Sun would have no more Power over it, to make it produce its fine Colourings, and &s;weet Smell, than over any other common Lump of Earth. Be not, therefore, di&s;couraged, that your &s;piritual Powers are by Nature in this defective inactive State; but learn from this Compari&s;on, that JESUS CHRIST, the Light and Life of the &s;piritual World, does all that to your dead, hard, angelic Nature, &s;hut up in an outward Body of earthly Fle&s;h and Blood, which the Sun of this World does to the Lily Root, namely, he helps you, and every other heavenly Man, out of his own pre&s;ent Death, into his highe&s;t

Go among your Fellow-Creatures&mdash;Go about doing Good&mdash;See, whether among your Families, in your Neighbourhood, among your Friends, yea and among your Enemies too, there is any Good to be done, any Differences to be &s;ettled, any injured Reputation to be redre&s;&s;ed, any &s;ick Man to be comforted, any in|nocent Mode&s;ty to be encouraged and brought into Ac|tion: For all this is JESUS CHRIST in you of a Truth: And do every good Thing you can any where, as Op|portunity pre&s;ents; and do it quickly, cheerfully and effectually, for its own Sake, becau&s;e it is good, know|ing that CHRIST does Good always for its own Sake.</P>
<P>This is all the Wor&s;hip you can perform to GOD, in Return for the Good his HOLY JESUS is always doing in you, namely, not to oppo&s;e the working of his Spirit in you&mdash;Do you but de&s;ire him to mend your Hearts, and he will do it. A Chri&s;tian cannot be at any Uncertainty about the pre&s;ent or future State of his Soul, or be ig|norant of what he is or to what he belongs, whether to the good or the wicked Spirit&mdash;&s;ince he finds in Scripture all the Things, all the Feelings, all the Sen&s;ibilities, all

the Pa&s;&s;ions de&s;cribed and ranged under their proper Ma&s;ters&mdash;Every Thing is minutely put down in this ble&s;&s;ed Book, that the Spirit of JESUS works and effects in our Hearts.</P>
<P>Would you (I again repeat it) know the JESUS of the holy Scriptures? Would you know the true CHRIST of GOD?&mdash;You can never know him otherwi&s;e than as you know your&s;elves, by a Self-evident Sen&s;ibility of what pa&s;&s;es, and is done, and felt, in your own Spirits&mdash;When Love, Benevolence, Genero&s;ity, Goodne&s;s, Pa|tience, Meekne&s;s and Humanity, are the reigning Af|fections of your Hearts, then CHRIST is in you of a Truth. For the&s;e, as I &s;aid, are declared in Scripture to be the true genuine Fruits of the HOLY SPIRIT&mdash;The&s;e are the Branches, CHRIST is the true Vine, and the FATHER is the Hu&s;bandman.</P>
<P>To conclude, would we wor&s;hip GOD on Earth as the Angels do in Heaven, we &s;hould neither think, nor &s;peak, nor know any Thing of SELF. They know no more than this, that GOD, when he made them, brought him&s;elf into a finite Figure, which he took out of his own Nature at his own good Will and Plea&s;ure; and when he had done all that was agreeable to his own good Plea&s;ure, as to their outward Form and Shape, then he brought his BLESSED SON into their Hearts.&mdash;This bringing his SON into their Hearts was not fully

known. <Q>It was a MYSTERY hid in GOD&mdash;namely, that he created all Things by JESUS CHRIST.</Q> This MYSTERY they &s;aw more fully opened&mdash;and they wor|&s;hipped the HOLY JESUS as a MYSTERY ju&s;t opening&mdash;<Q>And, without Controver&s;y, great is the MYSTERY of GODLINESS&mdash;GOD was manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h, ju&s;tified in the Spirit, &s;een of Angels, preached unto the Gen|tiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory.</Q>&mdash;With this I began&mdash;with this I end: This is and ever will, with all good Chri&s;tians, be the Begin|ning, Middle and End, the Alpha and Omega, the Fir&s;t and the La&s;t&mdash;And I pray GOD it may be &s;o to us all!&mdash;AMEN, AMEN.</P>
