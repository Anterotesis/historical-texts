<HEAD>The OCCASION.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT gave Occa&s;ion to the SERMONS here Ex|hibited, was an Amazing In&s;tance of what the poor Children of Men abandoned unto <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> may be left unto! A Prodigious In&s;tance of that <HI>Hardne&s;s of Heart,</HI> which e&s;pecially the <HI>Sins of Uncha&s;tity,</HI> accompanied with <HI>Delays of Repentance,</HI> do lead unto.</P>
<P><HI>Margaret Gaulacher,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Wo|man, arrived the la&s;t Winter from <HI>Cork</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> a Servant, that &s;oon found a Place in a Family where &s;he would not have wanted Opportuni|ties and Encouragements for the Ser|vice of GOD.</P>
<P>She had been by her part in a <HI>Theft</HI> brought into Trouble in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and after her Tran&s;portation hither, it was not long before &s;he was found in <HI>Thievi&s;h</HI> Practices.</P>
<P>Ere &s;he had been long here, it was begun to be &s;u&s;pected, that &s;he
<PB N="ii" REF="001764_0004_0FB7CBCFEEEC8708">
was with Child, by a Fornication; But &s;he &s;o Ob&s;tinately all along de|nied it, that at la&s;t &s;he mu&s;t feel the Effects of her Ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>She was delivered of her <HI>Illegiti|mate,</HI> when &s;he was all alone; and &s;he hid the <HI>Killed Infant</HI> out of the way; which was within a little while di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Of her Behaviour in the Time of her Impri&s;onment, and of the Means u&s;ed for her Good, there is an Ac|count given in our SERMONS.</P>
<P>The Woman was of a very Vio|lent Spirit; and the Tran&s;ports and Furies thereof, &s;ometimes were with &s;uch Violence, as carried in them, one would have thought, an uncom|mon Degree of <HI>Satanic Energie.</HI></P>
<P>By'nd by, &s;he would bewail her Pa&s;&s;ions, and promi&s;e to indulge her&s;elf no more in &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ionate Outrages.</P>
<P>One who owns him&s;elf to be a <HI>Roman-Catholick,</HI> affirms to me, that &s;he privately Declared her&s;elf unto him, to be in her Heart, of his Re|ligion;
<PB N="iii" REF="001764_0005_0FB7CBD0DEBB1890">
But &s;he never would own any thing of <HI>that</HI> unto the Mini&s;ters who vi&s;ited her with the Means of her Salvation.</P>
<P>A Gracious and Worthy Servant of God, Mr. <HI>Thomas Craighead,</HI> (a Faithful and Painful Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, who came from <HI>Ireland,</HI> much about the &s;ame time that &s;he did) having In&s;tructed her, and u&s;ed many Charitable Endeavours for her Good, was de&s;ired by her to be near her at her Execution; who ac|cordingly Pray'd with her there, and continued his In&s;tructions unto the La&s;t.</P>
<P>She &s;aid little, but referr'd her&s;elf to the Paper which had been read Publickly in the Congregation ju&s;t before.</P>
<P>And yet &s;he Frowardly let fall one Word, which did not &s;eem very con&s;i&s;tent with it; For which fret|ful Strain of Impatience, being re|buked, &s;he added, <HI>Then the Lord be Merciful unto me!</HI> and &s;poke no more.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="001764_0006_0FB7CBD2588A0738">
All that remains for us to do, is to leave her in the Hands of a So|vereign GOD, who&s;e <HI>Judgment,</HI> and not <HI>ours,</HI> has the Di&s;po&s;al of her; and make the <HI>be&s;t Improvement</HI> we can of &s;uch a Tragical Spectacle; for which the en&s;uing SERMONS are &s;ome E&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>But, I ought now if I can, to Refre&s;h my Readers, with &s;omething that &s;hall be more Agreeable, more Comfortable; have le&s;s to Trouble them; &s;omething that may be the <HI>Rever&s;e</HI> of &s;o &s;hocking a Spectacle, as has here given Trouble&s;ome I|dea's unto them.</P>
<P>Looking among my Re&s;erved Me|morials, I find an Excellent Hand|maid of the Lord, a bright Candi|date of the <HI>Heavenly Glory,</HI> fini&s;hing her Holy Life, in &s;uch Remarkable Circum&s;tances, that I cannot withold a Brief Relation of the Matter.</P>
<P>Some while ago, there died in our <HI>Salem,</HI> a Gentlewoman who&s;e Name was Mrs. <HI>Rix,</HI> the Daughter of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Skelton,</HI> (one of the

Some while before &s;he died, her Valuable Pa&s;tor, (the Reverend Mr. <HI>Nicholas Noyes,</HI>) gave her a Vi&s;it, wherein the Holy Minds of both, had their grateful Enter|tainments. Particularly, &s;he told him, That there had newly appeared un|to her, &s;everal <HI>Shining Per&s;ons,</HI> who told her, <HI>That they were not now come for her, but on that Day &s;ix Weeks hence, they would come for her, and fetch her away with a Glorious Equipage.</HI> And then &s;he immediately asked her Pa|&s;tor, <HI>I pray Syr, what is the meaning of the Word EQUIP AGE? I don't re|member that I have heard that Word EQUIP AGE!</HI>&mdash;Her Pa&s;tor with his u&s;ual Wi&s;dom, (tho' wondring at what &s;he &s;aid, and pondering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>An <HI>Hard-hearted Sinner&punc;</HI> is no unu|&s;ual Spectacle. <HI>Hardne&s;s of Heart</HI> is a Spectacle too frequently to be &s;een among the Sinful Children of Men.</P>
<P>But, what is an <HI>Hard Heart?</HI> And what are the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of it?</P>
<P>You know, in general; There is a <HI>Metaphor</HI> in the Phra&s;e. An <HI>Hard Heart</HI> is a Soul, that has Di&s;po&s;itions, wherein the Properties of a <HI>Stone</HI> are an&s;wered.

<PB N="8" REF="001764_0015_0FB7CBF42A3319C0">
We read, Zech. VII. 12. <HI>They have made their Hearts as an Adamant Stone.</HI> The Qualities of a <HI>Stone</HI> are then to be enquired after.

<P>Fir&s;t. An <HI>hard Heart,</HI> is an Heart very <HI>Dull of Understanding</HI> in the Word of God; not brought <HI>quickly to un|derstand</HI> the Truths and Things of Religion. We read; Mar.

Alas, the <HI>Heart</HI> of this Man is <HI>hardened.</HI> An <HI>hard Heart</HI> is the &s;ame with a <HI>&s;low Heart.</HI> We read, Luk.

An <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>hard</HI> to be in|&s;tructed in the Affairs of the King|dom of God. An <HI>hard Heart</HI> is a <HI>Sotti&s;h</HI> one. A <HI>blind Mind</HI> goes with an <HI>hard Heart.</HI> We read, Joh.

than into a <HI>Stone;</HI> you have cau&s;e to cry out, <HI>Oh! the hardne&s;s of my Heart! What will become of me!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. An <HI>hard Heart</HI> is an <HI>Heart</HI> not ea&s;ily impre&s;s'd upon; what the Word of God will not ea&s;i|ly make any <HI>good Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> upon. Sometimes the Word of God makes a <HI>Deep Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> upon the <HI>Heart;</HI> yea, the <HI>Heart</HI> is <HI>Conformed</HI> unto the Word of God, as if it were ca&s;t into the Mould of it. So we read, Rom. VI. 17. <HI>Ye have obey'd from the Heart, that Form of Doctrine whereinto ye were drawn.</HI> This is not an <HI>hard Heart;</HI> It is an <HI>Heart of Wax,</HI> rather than an <HI>Heart of Stone.</HI> But now, an <HI>hard Heart</HI> is one; that Hears the <HI>Commandments</HI> of God, but will take no Notice of them; will not obey them, will not ob&s;erve them. It hears the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of God, but it is not affected with them; the <HI>Con&s;olations of God</HI> are <HI>&s;mall</HI> unto it. It hears the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of God, but it is not affrighted at them; it <HI>Mocks at the Fear:</HI> The great God &s;ays; Jer. XXIII. 29. <HI>Is

'Tis e&s;pecially thus, when People do like the Wick|ed <HI>Thief</HI> on the Cro&s;s, <HI>Bla&s;pheme</HI> God under their Afflictions; When they are full of <HI>Di&s;content,</HI> full of <HI>Impati|ence,</HI> full of <HI>Murmuring</HI> under their Afflictions; full of <HI>Envy</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e who do not endure the like Afflicti|ons; When they take <HI>Indirect Cour&s;es</HI> to e&s;cape their Afflictions, <HI>unlawful Methods</HI> to abate their Afflictions.

<P>Secondly.

<P>Thirdly. They that are <HI>Incorrigible</HI> Sinners under Sufferings, are unque|&s;tionably <HI>Unconverted</HI> Sinners. We read; P&s;al. CXIX. 71. <HI>It is good for me, that I have been Afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</HI> It is then <HI>good for us</HI> that we have Suffered any Humbling Things, when we are quickened in and by our <HI>Sufferings,</HI> to Learn, and to Love, and to Do the <HI>Statutes</HI> of God.

<P>La&s;tly.

They make a <HI>Fearle&s;s,</HI> Dar|ring, Hardy Challenge to the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> of God. God threatens them who are <HI>Incorrigible</HI> under their <HI>Sufferings,</HI> at that rate; Lev. XXVI. 23, 24. <HI>If ye will not be Reformed by the&s;e Things, then will I Puni&s;h you yet &s;even times more for your Sins.</HI> God will go on, <HI>Puni&s;hing</HI> the <HI>Incorrigible</HI> Sinner, and Multiplying His Plagues upon him, until he has de&s;troy'd the Sin|ner wonderfully.

GOD &s;hows us the Evil of Sin, and what a dangerous thing it is to commit it, that we may tremble at the Motion of it, and fly therefrom.</P>
<P>CAN we think that He who warns us of our Danger de&s;ires that it &s;hould befall us? No, far from it: It were the mo&s;t cro&s;s and perver&s;e Imputation that can be; mo&s;t ab&s;urd, and al&s;o mo&s;t ungrateful and bafe.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="001764_0122_0FB7CB57F449C1E8">
THE Threatning does not make the <HI>Effect</HI> of Sin to be what it is: No; <HI>that</HI> had been the &s;ame without the Publication of the Cur&s;e.

<P>It is not owing to the <HI>Ab&s;olute and meer Will</HI> of GOD, that he who Sins &s;hall die; but to the Holine&s;s and <HI>Rectitude</HI> of the Divine Nature, and to the wi&s;e and <HI>Righteous Admini&s;tra|tion</HI> of His Government.</P>
<P>THE Threatning of God's Word only lets us know what <HI>will be</HI> and <HI>mu&s;t be</HI> in ca&s;e of Sin; what the Wi&s;|dom and Ju&s;tice of GOD make Ne|ce&s;&s;ary.

<P>THIS Divine and Glorious Per&s;on &s;ubmitted for this End to the deepe&s;t Humiliation and Aba&s;ement, to bit|ter Sorrows and to an accur&s;ed Death. He was made <HI>Sin</HI> and a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> to de|liver us from the <HI>&s;ame.</HI> He paid in Ran&s;om for our Souls His own Life, His precious Blood.
