<HEAD>"CONSIDERATIONS ON THE PRESENT STATE OF <HI>VIRGINIA"</HI> EXAMINED.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the Author of <HI>this little Performance</HI> was <HI>born</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> I &s;hall not que&s;tion, &s;ince he has been plea&s;ed to tell us the Fact was <HI>really</HI> &s;o. It &s;eems equally immaterial whe|ther the <HI>Principles,</HI> in which he was nurtured, were of a mixed or <HI>&s;imple</HI> Nature, as it mu&s;t be obvious that <HI>one Kind</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Principles</HI> &s;olely predominates at pre&s;ent and has given his Mind a &s;trange and unaccountable <HI>Bias.</HI> The perfect Enjoyment of his private <HI>Freedom</HI> in thinking for him&s;elf, and offering his <HI>Sentiments</HI> to this Country upon every Occa&s;ion, I wi&s;h not to interrupt; but he mu&s;t ex|cu&s;e me, if I &s;hould differ with him in Opinion, as to his being &s;o <HI>devoted a Servant</HI> to the Welfare of this Commu|nity, as he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf. Whether the <HI>Serenity</HI> of my Mind or the <HI>Soundne&s;s</HI> of my Under&s;tanding will ju&s;tify me in offering my&s;elf a <HI>Candidate</HI> for a <HI>Seat</HI> in his <HI>exclu&s;ive Judicature,</HI> I will not determine; all I &s;hall engage for is, that I will not be <HI>clamorous.</HI> The pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Situation of Virginia is what all good Men mu&s;t heartily lament; but I hope he does not mean to in&s;inuate that we have <HI>wantonly</HI> drawn any of the&s;e Misfortunes on our&s;elves. He &s;hould recollect his Latin Adage, "<HI>Jus &s;uum cuique tribuere,</HI>" that "<HI>Foundation of &s;ocial Duties,</HI>" to which, without Doubt, he hath religiou&s;ly conformed in every In&s;tance. Popular Odium, the Weight of which he is &s;o very &s;en&s;ible of, it is
<PB N="4" REF="013500_0004_0F90FA2F00894C70">
far from my Intention to excite again&s;t him; but I am more &s;trongly impelled to di&s;pute his great <HI>Indifference</HI> about an Office, "&s;hould he po&s;&s;e&s;s one," &s;o very precarious in its <HI>Tenure.</HI> My &s;ole View is to put my Countrymen a little more on their Guard, and to remove, if I can, tho&s;e un|favourable Impre&s;&s;ions, he has laboured to make on the Minds of <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>If &s;ome Men have unwarrantably and unju&s;tly, in the Author's Opinion, a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves that "mo&s;t ex|alted and honourable Appellation" of a PATRIOT, perhaps there may be found, in the World, other <HI>Characters</HI> equally exceptionable. I do not wi&s;h to limit his Ardour and the Overflowings of his Zeal for the Good of his Country; but would gladly be informed to what Purpo&s;e, on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, the Public is entertained with &s;o many <HI>trite</HI> Ob|&s;ervations on the Nature of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution; I pre|&s;ume to give them this Name, becau&s;e they have been &s;o repeatedly rung in our Ears, that the mere&s;t <HI>Scioli&s;t,</HI> the verie&s;t Smatterer in Politicks mu&s;t long &s;ince have had them all by Rote. It is devoutly to be wi&s;hed that the Con&s;titu|tion of this Country were a&s;&s;imilated in every e&s;&s;ential Point to that of Great Britain; I mean &s;o long as this can be maintained upon its ju&s;t, original Principles. Our Con&s;ti|tution, however, &s;uch as it is, hath &s;uffered no <HI>internal</HI> Violation, that I know of. Infringements of this Sort &s;eem peculiar to <HI>another Meridian</HI>; had they gained Ground among&s;t us, perhaps we might not have been left entirely without an Apology, con&s;idering the <HI>Force of Example,</HI> and this held out by tho&s;e, who affect to be &s;o much our Superiors. If the <HI>uncontroulable</HI> and <HI>unlimited Power</HI> claimed by PARLIAMENT over the Colonies is di&s;puted on <HI>legal</HI> and <HI>con&s;titutional Principles,</HI> this &s;urely is exceedingly wide of what the Author would in&s;inuate. That the Prerogative of the King, "exi&s;ts here in its fulle&s;t <HI>Lu&s;tre</HI> and <HI>Vigour,</HI>" and that it ever ought to do &s;o, is what we chearfully
<PB N="5" REF="013500_0005_0F90FA2FEE116178">
acknowledge and earne&s;tly contend for; but the plain Inference which the Author would have drawn from his Ob&s;ervations, if he intends any Thing <HI>material,</HI> is that, by di&s;puting the <HI>Power of Parliament,</HI> we draw into Que&s;tion the PREROGATIVE of our mo&s;t gracious <HI>Sovereign</HI>; than which, nothing can be more contrary to the Sentiments and Wi&s;hes of all America.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that every One, who doth not adopt the Author's Principles, is to be con&s;idered as a <HI>de&s;igning Man</HI> and mu&s;t no longer expect to be honoured with any Share of his <HI>Con|fidence. Hard and cruel Fate!</HI> but we mu&s;t endeavour to bear up under it, as well as we can.</P>
<P>That the unhappy Di&s;pute, now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Great Britain and the Colonies, is of a very intere&s;ting Nature mu&s;t be acknowledged by every Well-wi&s;her to either Country. Viewing it in its exten&s;ive dangerous Con&s;e|quences, I believe few have been more affected by the gloomy Pro&s;pect than my&s;elf; it hath even <HI>harrowed up my very Soul.</HI> The Reflection, that we live in a State of Di&s;cord with our Fellow Subjects, whom we formerly con|&s;idered and &s;till wi&s;h to e&s;teem as our deare&s;t Friends; and, above all, the Horrors, which every American mu&s;t feel from an Apprehen&s;ion that the Mind of his gracious Sove|reign may have been impre&s;&s;ed with Ideas of a Di&s;repect and Want of Loyalty in his Subjects, mu&s;t be extremely afflicting. I will venture to expre&s;s it as my firm and &s;ted|fa&s;t Belief that there can be found in no Part of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions a warmer and more cordial Attachment to his &s;acred Per&s;on and Government, than prevails throughout the Continent of America; for my&s;elf I will &s;peak with &s;till greater Confidence and &s;ay that, had I a Window in my Brea&s;t, and his Maje&s;ty could deign to look into it, he would there &s;ee a Heart glowing with the <HI>pure&s;t Sentiments of Duty and Affection.</HI> Oppre&s;&s;ed, however, as we are by
<PB N="6" REF="013500_0006_0F90FA30A607B7C0">
&s;o weighty a Burthen, we neverthele&s;s ought not, we cannot lo&s;e Sight of what is due to our Country, our&s;elves, and our Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The Author tells us of his Per&s;ua&s;ion that the Di&s;pute may be
<Q>adju&s;ted without Noi&s;e; and the public Tran|quillity again re&s;tored, if Gentlemen would pur&s;ue tho&s;e Mea&s;ures, which are likely to effect what is every Man's Wi&s;h to obtain.</Q>
Let him propo&s;e tho&s;e Mea&s;ures; &s;o far from being <HI>noi&s;y,</HI> I will become all <HI>Attention,</HI> and catch, with <HI>Avidity,</HI> the delightful Accents, as they drop from his mellifluous Tongue. If
<Q>the Wi&s;dom of his Coun&s;els &s;hould be able to effect this de&s;irable End, his Memory &s;hall be gratefully perpetuated in the Hearts of all his Countrymen,</Q>
and, to the whole Continent of America, he &s;hall become the Great Apollo. What he may have, in Re&s;erve to be offered, when he inclines to "de&s;cend to Particulars," I will not pre&s;ume to anticipate. I mu&s;t for the pre&s;ent, take Leave to examine, a little, tho&s;e
<Q>ob|vious Means,</Q>
he has been plea&s;ed to recommend.</P>
<P><Q>We ought, it is &s;aid, in the fir&s;t Place, to declare, in the mo&s;t public Manner, that the Act of the Bo&s;tonians in de&s;troying the Property of the Ea&s;t India Company was illegal and ought not to be countenanced. This will evince our Uprightne&s;s and &s;erve as an Admonition to tho&s;e head&s;trong People never to go to the &s;ame Lengths again. Then let us petition his Maje&s;ty; a&s;&s;ure him of our inviolable Attachment to his Per&s;on and Government and implore his Royal Interpo&s;ition in procuring a Re|peal of tho&s;e Acts, which have excited &s;uch an Alarm among&s;t us; and, when abrogated, will quiet the Minds of his mo&s;t faithful Subjects in America.</Q>
I never have, nor will I ever attempt to ju&s;tify the Bo&s;tonians or any others in Acts of Violence or Intemperance; nor can I pre&s;ume to join, in a public Condemnation of them, without being
<PB N="7" REF="013500_0007_0F90FA32008FCC80">
convinced of their Guilt. In &s;hort, I cannot form a proper Judgment without being fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their Cau&s;e and a thorough Knowledge of the Motives of their Conduct. <HI>Wantonly</HI> and <HI>unju&s;tly</HI> to de&s;troy the Property of another, I hold in utter Abhorrence; but I can ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e an Act of Oppre&s;&s;ion, which will ju&s;tify a Sufferer in the Execution of every Means nece&s;&s;ary for his Security. Whether the Bo&s;tonians were reduced to &s;uch an Extremity I will not determine. Ju&s;tifying or condemning them are very di&s;|tinct Con&s;iderations from the Opinion we form of the Proceedings of Parliament. Each of the&s;e will be more di&s;tinctly and properly remarked upon, when I come to take a View of other Parts of the Work. I &s;hould be glad, however, in the mean Time, to know who are particularly meant by the <HI>Bo&s;tonians.</HI> If, when we are invited to a general <HI>Pro&s;cription</HI> of tho&s;e unhappy People, it is intended that we &s;hould condemn them in a <HI>Lump,</HI> the <HI>Innocent</HI> with the <HI>Guilty,</HI> the Author &s;urely mu&s;t give up every Pretence to tho&s;e Principles of Ju&s;tice, he would fain have us believe him &s;o much in Love with. If, on the other Hand, he means that we &s;hould condemn the <HI>Guilty</HI> only, why were they not di&s;criminated? This perhaps would not have laid a proper Groundwork for the Petition recommended, as it would nece&s;&s;arily imply a Cen&s;ure of Parliament, who&s;e new Mode of Puni&s;hment extends, not only to all the In|habitants of the Town of Bo&s;ton, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> involves, either <HI>mediately</HI> or <HI>immediately,</HI> mo&s;t of the Inhabitants of the whole Province; &s;uch a Petition, therefore, could hardly be conceived in <HI>agreeable</HI> LANGUAGE. I wi&s;h, upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, as this e&s;pecially, that Gentlemen would avoid connecting the Name of his Maje&s;ty with that of any of his Subjects, however dignified or di&s;tingui&s;hed. We have a Maxim in our Law, which hath long &s;ince become pro|verbial, that the KING <HI>can do no Wrong.</HI> It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that his MAJESTY can HIMSELF attend to and di|rect all the arduous Affairs of his extended Dominions.
<PB N="8" REF="013500_0008_0F90FA3229BD97B8">
The Con&s;titution hath therefore a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with a Mini&s;try, who become the o&s;ten&s;ible Men, and are accountable, for any Wrong or Injury, that may fall on the Subject through their Coun&s;el and Advice. As to petitioning our mo&s;t gra|cious Sovereign, I &s;hould prefer a Step of this Sort, pre|vious to all others. America, I am per&s;uaded, would pro&s;trate her&s;elf at the Foot of his Throne and not think of any other Means, till this was tried; I would join in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful Applications to both Hou&s;es of Parliament for the Redre&s;s of our Grievances; but, alas! of what Avail would the&s;e Things be? Have they not been repeatedly attempted without the de&s;ired Effect, as well by this, as the other Colonies? I would recommend to the Author's Peru&s;al and mo&s;t &s;erious Reflection the &s;everal <HI>di&s;regarded</HI> Petitions preferred again&s;t the Bo&s;ton Port Bill, and &s;hould be glad to know how it could have happened, that &s;uch dutiful and re&s;pectful Applications, and &s;uch Cogency of Rea&s;oning were with&s;tood and &s;urmounted, if Mea&s;ures of the &s;ame Sort are now likely to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>In Exertion of what the Parliament claims as a Right of Taxation, we are reminded of the Duty impo&s;ed upon Stamps and Tea; by which the Author would have his Readers &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e two Duties were laid by the &s;ame Act of Parliament. This may &s;erve his Purpo&s;e, in the Contra&s;t afterwards drawn to prove that the Duty on Tea ought to be con&s;idered merely as a <HI>Regulation of Trade</HI>; but I beg Leave to inform him that this Tea Duty was the Offspring of another Act, which impo&s;ed the Duties on Gla&s;s, Paper, &amp;c. And that this Act compared with another of the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion clearly evinces that it was not intended as a commercial Regulation, but originally de&s;igned as one Article of the American Revenue, and afterwards retained merely as a <HI>Precedent.</HI> The Stamp Act he &s;ays was re|pealed; very true; and America expre&s;&s;ed her Thanks for it, hoping that Concord and Harmony would be re&s;tored
<PB N="9" REF="013500_0009_0F90FA32E53A74E0">
and firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed. We are told, in the next Place, that,
<Q>though the Duty on Tea remained, yet all Unea|&s;ine&s;s, on that Head, &s;eemed to have &s;ub&s;ided for a con|&s;iderable Time pa&s;t; that the End of both Parties was an&s;wered; the Parliament's in a&s;&s;erting, and America's in denying;</Q>
and why,
<Q>it is a&s;ked, &s;hould not the Di&s;pute re&s;t at this Point? Fre&s;h Clamours need not be made, until fre&s;h Cau&s;es for &s;uch are given; new Di&s;tur|bances for an old Affront are neither con&s;i&s;tent with the Dictates of Policy or Prudence;</Q>
all this is granted; but I find we &s;hall differ, as to the recent Cau&s;es of Complaint, which have been unju&s;tly given to the Americans. Had the Duty on Tea continued, where it was left a few Years &s;ince, we &s;hould have troubled our&s;elves very little about it; but, if arbitrary Steps have been taken to force this Tea on the Coloni&s;ts and compel them to pay the odious Duty, the Ca&s;e becomes quite altered. Let us examine this Part of the Subject a little more minutely.</P>
<P>That a regular Sy&s;tem hath been formed to &s;ubjugate America by e&s;tabli&s;hing that <HI>civil Li&s;t</HI> in the Colonies, which was planned and &s;o earne&s;tly recommended by a certain <HI>Go|vernour,</HI> mu&s;t be evident to every attentive Ob&s;erver of the Proceedings of Parliament for a Series of Years pa&s;t. I will refer the Reader no farther back than the 4th Year of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's Reign, when the Act pa&s;&s;ed impo&s;ing a Duty of &pound;. 7 per Ton on Madeira Wine and other Duties on different Articles. The&s;e were acquie&s;ced in, as they carried with them a &s;pecious Appearance of Advantage to the Colonies and bore the Semblance of Regulations of Com|merce. The Way being &s;o far paved, the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> then &s;eized what was judged a convenient Opportunity to impo&s;e his Stamp Duties; the Americans were ju&s;tly alarmed, plainly &s;eeing through the whole De&s;ign. Upon a &s;ea&s;onable and &s;pirited Oppo&s;ition, the Stamp Act was repealed, but
<PB N="10" REF="013500_0010_0F90FA33A8EC0B30">
not without a Declaration of the <HI>Supremacy</HI> or rather <HI>Omni|potence</HI> of Parliament; this gave the Coloni&s;ts very little Concern; a Declaration nearly of the &s;ame Sort, though not &s;o exten&s;ive, has been made many Years before re&s;pecting Ireland; this declaratory Act might have remained, with the other as a dead Letter, unregarded, had there been no future Attempts to revive it. The favourite Scheme of an American Civil Li&s;t &s;eems to have been kept in full View, and the &s;ucceeding Mini&s;ter, finding that the former Attacks on the Rights of the Colonies had been made too openly, thought it mo&s;t prudent to &s;hift the Ground and endeavour to effect the &s;ame Purpo&s;e by political Fine&s;&s;e His Manoeuvres were then di&s;played in another Act impo&s;ing Duties on Gla&s;s, Paper, Painter's Colours and Tea. This, at fir&s;t, had the Appearance of a commercial Regulation; but the latent De&s;ign was &s;oon detected and fully expo&s;ed. The Oppo&s;ition made to the Mea&s;ure produced a very inti|midating Addre&s;s of both Hou&s;es of Parliament to the King, by which his Maje&s;ty was de&s;ired to have Pro&s;ecutions &s;et on Foot again&s;t &s;uch, as were deemed principal Actors, upon a <HI>&s;tale</HI> Statute of King Henry the 8th; the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence would have been, that tho&s;e, whom the <HI>Gover|nor</HI> thought proper, were to have been <HI>&s;eized</HI> and <HI>tran&s;ported</HI> to England, there to be tried for their &s;uppo&s;ed Offences, contrary to every Principle of Law and Ju&s;tice. The Con|&s;i&s;tency of this Addre&s;s with tho&s;e Arguments urged by the able&s;t Advocates for Parliamentary <HI>Power</HI> to prove that the Colonies are &s;o far a Part of the Empire of Great Britain, as to be &s;ubject to <HI>every</HI> Law of Parliament, is left to them and our Author to be reconciled. How could the Colonies avoid being alarmed at a Proceeding big with the mo&s;t dan|gerous Con&s;equences and utterly &s;ubver&s;ive of every Thing dear and valuable to them? The&s;e arbitrary Strides of Power were prote&s;ted again&s;t by our Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es in their Se&s;&s;ion of 1769, and the Re&s;olutions, they were driven into brought on the Di&s;&s;olution of the A&s;&s;embly. The
<PB N="11" REF="013500_0011_0F90FA348DB644E8">
Colony being reduced to &s;o di&s;agreeable a Situation, the fir&s;t A&s;&s;ociation, which the Author affects to ridicule as a nuga|tory, in&s;ignificant Act, was entered into; and, though not &s;o univer&s;ally adopted nor &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly adhered to, as it ought to have been, yet I am per&s;uaded that it was the prin|cipal efficient Cau&s;e of a &s;ub&s;equent Act of Parliament in the &s;ucceeding Year, by which the Duties on all tho&s;e Articles of Briti&s;h Manufacture, which included mo&s;t that the Co|lonies had Occa&s;ion for, were repealed; the Duty on Tea, however, was &s;till continued; for what Purpo&s;e will be pre|&s;ently inquired. This repealing Act being attended with &s;ome particular Circum&s;tances, not very friendly to America, the A&s;&s;ociation, upon being revi&s;ed, was continued with &s;ome Alterations allowing Importers a greater Latitude. The Parliament not having revived their di&s;agreeable Mea|&s;ures, but &s;hewn <HI>&s;ome Di&s;po&s;ition</HI> by this Act to relieve America, at lea&s;t, from a Part of her Grievances, many Per&s;ons became indifferent, as to the A&s;&s;ociation, and, at a general Meeting of the A&s;&s;ociates, the Whole was di&s;&s;olved except as to the Article of Tea, and others under the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, which they continued to protect again&s;t. That this was too little regarded by many mu&s;t be acknow|ledged: The Duty, merely as to the <HI>Quantum</HI> of it, might have been thought too incon&s;iderable to deprive them of what the Author &s;uppo&s;es <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> had made almo&s;t a <HI>Nece&s;|&s;ary of Life</HI>; &s;ome Men &s;till &s;aw its evil <HI>political</HI> Tendency and therefore ab&s;tained from importing or buying it, though many others did not, and, I believe, <HI>they</HI> now &s;incerely re|pent that <HI>all</HI> had not held it in equal <HI>Abhorrence.</HI> That this Duty on Tea was originally impo&s;ed for the &s;ole Purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a <HI>Revenue</HI> in America, and not as a <HI>commercial</HI> Re|gulation; and that it was afterwards retained, as a <HI>Precedent,</HI> I think, mu&s;t be evident to every One, who con&s;iders the &s;everal Acts of Parliament relating to the Subject. The <HI>Act it&s;elf,</HI> which impo&s;ed this Duty, declares it to be for the Purpo&s;e of a <HI>Revenue.</HI> We all know that Tea paid a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="12" REF="013500_0012_0F90FA37CEDC3300">
Duty in England; the Ea&s;t India Company found great Difficulties in di&s;po&s;ing of their Tea loaded with that Duty. The Parliament, in the very &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion, that the American Duty was impo&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ed another Act allowing a Drawback of the whole <HI>Duties</HI> payable in <HI>England</HI> on all Tea, which &s;hould be exported to America in the original Packages, upon the <HI>Company's agreeing to make good any Lo&s;s</HI> the Revenue might &s;u&s;tain by the&s;e Debentures. This Act was to continue to the 5th of July 1772. In the Se&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame Year, 1772, another Act pa&s;&s;ed, to continue for five Years, allowing a Drawback of three Fifths of the Duty on all Tea, which &s;hould be purcha&s;ed of the Company and exported to America. We know that, by former Statutes, the Company were obliged to &s;ell all their Commodities, Tea among&s;t the re&s;t, at public Auction, by Inch of Candle, to the highe&s;t Bidders; and were not allowed to export <HI>any Thing</HI> on their own Account. In 1773, when it is probable the Plan was concerted for &s;hipping the enormous Quantities of Tea, which have occa&s;ioned our Di&s;turbances, to Ame|rica, another Act pa&s;&s;ed authori&s;ing the Company, under a Licence from the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury, to export any Quantity of Tea to America, without being obliged to expo&s;e it at public Auction; and upon &s;uch Ex|portation, the whole Engli&s;h Duty was to be drawn back, in&s;tead of the three Fifths allowed by the Act of the former Se&s;&s;ion. The Que&s;tion I would a&s;k is this; if either a com|mercial Regulation or the general Revenue, and not the e&s;tab|li&s;hing a <HI>Precedent</HI> again&s;t <HI>America,</HI> had been the Object of Parliament, why might not &s;o much, at lea&s;t, of the old Duty, as was thought &s;ufficient to an&s;wer their American Purpo&s;e of barely rai&s;ing Money, have been continued? This would have given no Unea&s;ine&s;s; the Expence and Trouble of collecting the Duty in America and remitting the Surplus, if any &s;hould ari&s;e, to the <HI>Receipt of his Ma|je&s;ty's Exchequer</HI> in England would have been &s;aved. The proper An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion will &s;hew the De&s;ign of Par|liament,
<PB N="13" REF="013500_0013_0F90FA3914A2F580">
and, at, the &s;ame Time prove what the Company had in View by &s;ending the Tea to America. The large Quantity, they had on Hand made it a Drug, and they had engaged to make good to Government any <HI>Deficiency</HI> that might ari&s;e on the Duty. The allowing the Company to export their Tea on their own Account, ju&s;t at this <HI>Juncture,</HI> contrary to <HI>&s;tanding Regulations,</HI> which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;o many Years, affords an additional Proof of the Point in Que&s;|tion. Whatever Lo&s;s, therefore, the Company may have &s;u&s;tained by the De&s;truction of the Tea, or having it returned upon their Hands, &s;hould be placed to the Account of their own Imprudence, or rather, to what &s;eems to have been a Co-operation with the Mini&s;try to <HI>pour</HI> it down the Throats of the Americans. Suppo&s;e the Company had a Right to monopoli&s;e this Branch of Trade, to the <HI>Exclu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Pre|judice</HI> of all <HI>other Merchants</HI>; were they not &s;ufficiently ap|pri&s;ed how very di&s;agreeable and odious their &s;ending the Tea to America would be to the Inhabitants of all the Con|tinent? Governor John&s;ton, we find, declared publicly in the Hou&s;e of Commons that he had warned their <HI>Chairman</HI> again&s;t &s;ending over the Tea and told him the bad Con&s;e|quences, that would probably attend &s;uch a Step; let the Refu&s;al of &s;everal Captains of Ships to take it on Freight be al&s;o recollected. The&s;e Circum&s;tances were &s;urely enough to have convinced them that they could not expect, in a regu|lar, equal Cour&s;e of Trade, to di&s;po&s;e of their Tea in Ame|rica. Was it not the greate&s;t In&s;ult upon this whole Con|tinent to attempt to force upon them a Commodity, which they had &s;o much Rea&s;on to be convinced, when introduced in this Manner, would be con&s;idered as bringing with it tho&s;e <HI>Shackles</HI> the Author &s;peaks of? If the Company &s;hould pretend that they did not &s;ee the Matter in this Light, I would gladly know how other Men, of different Cla&s;&s;es, happened to be &s;o very &s;agacious as to foretel what followed? I cannot but &s;uppo&s;e that the Company had one of two Things in View. They either mu&s;t have hoped that the
<PB N="14" REF="013500_0014_0F90FA39ADCBF7F0">
public Virtue of the Americans would not be able to with|&s;tand the Temptation thrown in their Way; if they pur|cha&s;ed the Tea, all would be well; both the Company's Purpo&s;e and that of Admini&s;tration would be an&s;wered; the Drug would be got rid of and the Duty would be paid. If, in the &s;econd Place, the Scheme &s;hould be ob&s;tructed and the Tea thereby mi&s;carry, their ultimate Expectation and Reliance &s;eems to have been that the Mini&s;try would &s;upport and indemnify them.</P>
<P>In Hopes of aggravating the Offence of the Bo&s;tonians, the Author tells us that, by
<Q>our Magna Charta, even Aliens are protected in their Commerce with us; and, had a Frenchman, the avowed Enemy of our Country, im|ported Tea into Bo&s;ton he would have met with no Mole&s;tation;</Q>
if this be &s;o, Thanks to the Rigour of the Acts of Trade, Courts of Admiralty, &amp;c. But, &s;ince he has drawn the Compari&s;on, I would gladly know what Sort of Trade, even a Frenchman can carry on with Ame|rica, that would prove &s;o injurious and de&s;tructive, as that which the Company endeavoured to force with the Coloni&s;ts. I agree it is unlawful to trade with Foreigners, and that we ought, by no Means, to encourage &s;uch a Practice; but I &s;ay the Trade attempted by the Company, <HI>all Circum&s;tances con&s;idered,</HI> was equally illegal and more unju&s;t. I will &s;up|po&s;e for a Moment, though the Fact is &s;upported by no Sort of Evidence, which I know of, that the whole Town of Bo&s;ton had been concerned in de&s;troying the Tea, and &s;ub|mit to every impartial Per&s;on how far they were blameable. I mu&s;t here take Leave to remind our Author of one of his Law Maxims; <HI>Sic utere tuo, ut alienum non loedas.</HI> Make a free U&s;e of your Property, but, &s;o u&s;e it, as not to preju|dice what belongs to another. I take it that the Freedom and Liberties of America are pretty e&s;&s;ential Parts of their <HI>Property</HI>; I al&s;o con&s;ider a Community was very materially intere&s;ted in pre&s;erving the <HI>Virtue</HI> of its <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ferent Members;
<PB N="15" REF="013500_0015_0F90FA3B241FCD80">
&s;o that every Infringement or Attempt to deprive the Own|ers of either Species of this Property, I conclude comes within the prohibitory Part of this Maxim. It is alledged that the Bo&s;tonians might have declined <HI>purcha&s;ing this Tea</HI>; but why &s;hould we expect to find a larger Portion of public Virtue among&s;t the&s;e People, than in other Countries? Many I make no Doubt would have refrained from buying, but others, probably could not, or would not have with|&s;tood the Temptation of purcha&s;ing at <HI>Half Price.</HI></P>
<P>The Company having been di&s;appointed in one of their Expectations, they are now to be gratified in the other. The <HI>&s;upreme,</HI> the <HI>omnipotent Power</HI> of Parliament is to be exerted to procure for them what is called Ju&s;tice, Indem|nification, &amp;c.

<P>He introduces his State of Facts with the People of Rhode I&s;land; the Ca&s;e of the Ga&s;p&eacute;e Schooner and the Court of Inquiry. Would not a Stranger &s;uppo&s;e, from his Relation of this Affair, that not only all the Inhabitants of Rhode I&s;land, but that this whole Continent was concerned either in perpetrating, abetting, or <HI>countenancing</HI> that flagiti|ous and wicked Act of burning his Maje&s;ty's Schooner and maltreating the Commander? Nothing I believe was far|ther from the Truth; I am &s;ure every Man, in this Colony, whom I heard &s;peak on the Subject, loudly condemned the Deed, and, had it been in their Power, would I believe, have con&s;igned the Perpetrators of it to a <HI>legal,</HI> exemplary and condign Puni&s;hment.
<Q>Government it is &s;aid, opened a Court of Inquiry and that this Mode of Proceeding was fixed on as a Te&s;t, from whence it might be known,
<PB N="16" REF="013500_0016_0F90FA3B4644FB00">
whether this In&s;ult was a general Act of the Province;</Q>
if not, it was
<Q>concluded that the better Cla&s;s of People would exert them&s;elves in Order to bring the Offenders to Ju&s;tice; that, no Di&s;covery having been made, the Court could proceed no farther; and, though <HI>in&s;ulted</HI> in all the public New&s;papers on the <HI>Continent,</HI> the Mini&s;try were unwilling to proceed to Extremities, but &s;at down &s;ilently under the Affront, laughed at by the Rhode I&s;landers and held in Deri&s;ion by Foreigners.</Q>
Without detaining the Reader by a minute Scrutiny into the Propriety of ha&s;tily &s;etting up this <HI>Court of Inquiry</HI> in a Country regularly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and, where I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ince we are not told the contrary, proper Juri&s;dictions are fixed, competent to the Examination and Puni&s;hment of all Of|fences and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the Law; without relying on the ju&s;t Alarms, which novel Juri&s;dictions are apt to give a free People, I mu&s;t remind the Reader of a few <HI>trifling Circum&s;tances,</HI> which &s;eem to have been <HI>carefully</HI> kept behind the Scene. Will the Author allow us to recollect what was to have been done with the Culprits, had they been di&s;co|vered. If I do not forget the Act of Parliament made on this Occa&s;ion, all Per&s;ons, &s;uppo&s;ed guilty of any of the Offences therein enumerated, were to be tran&s;ported to Great Britain and there tried for their <HI>Lives.</HI> It was this, which gave the Alarm, and very ju&s;tly to the whole Continent. I find a Di&s;po&s;ition in &s;ome Men to aggravate every Tran&s;action of the Americans into the mo&s;t enormous Crime, whil&s;t they are prepared to palliate and even ju&s;tify every Act of the Mini&s;try, however arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive. The dragging a Man from all his Connexions into a di&s;tant Country to undergo the &s;evere&s;t Trial; to &s;trip him of the glorious Privilege of being tried by his Peers of his Vicinage, the mo&s;t valuable Birthright of every Freeman; to deprive him of the Benefit of the Te&s;timony of his Witne&s;&s;es, whom he has no Means of compelling to cro&s;s the Atlantic; of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Comfort of his Friends, when in a State of

the deepe&s;t Affliction, and to expo&s;e him to the bittere&s;t Per&s;ecution of his Enemies; the&s;e are <HI>trivial</HI> Circum&s;tances, not worthy our <HI>Attention or Concern.</HI> If the Mini&s;try were in&s;ulted in the public Papers, I had no Hand in it, though I frankly acknowledge my Concurrence in condemning &s;o uncon&s;titutional and oppre&s;&s;ive a Mea&s;ure and hope that no American will ever &s;ubmit to it. Odious as &s;o unju&s;t and arbitrary an Act of Power mu&s;t appear in the Eyes of every Friend to Liberty, the <HI>fundamental</HI> Principles of our Laws and Con&s;titution; yet the Author is plea&s;ed to fix it as the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> of his <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> of the Mini&s;try in their Attack upon Bo&s;ton, &s;till, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> more cruel and unju&s;t. As a Proof that the Mini&s;try were not concerned in the Importation of the Tea, we are told that
<Q>the Admiral was de&s;ired to in|terfere, when the Di&s;turbance happened,</Q>
but declined doing &s;o, con&s;idering it as a "mere mercantile Adventure." Viewing the Matter in this Light; did he not form the better Judgment? But how contrary is the Author's A&s;&s;er|tion to the Admiral's own Letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty, in which he de&s;ires the Lords of the Admiralty may be informed
<Q>that, during the whole Tran&s;action, neither the <HI>Governor, Magi&s;trates, Owners</HI> or <HI>Revenue Officers</HI> called for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; if they had, that he could ea&s;ily have prevented the Execution of the Plan, but mu&s;t have endangered the Lives of many <HI>innocent</HI> People by firing on the Town.</Q>
I cannot, con&s;idering what has &s;ince happened, &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Governor and the other Per&s;ons alluded to,</HI> re&s;trained from making &s;uch Application to the Admiral for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by any Motives of Regard for the Inhabitants. We know there are &s;ometimes Wheels within Wheels, to be put in Motion by &s;ecret Springs, which it is not always convenient to have expo&s;ed to common Ob&s;ervation. It &s;eems to me that even the Pre&s;ervation of their Tea, by all Accounts extremely mean in Quality, would not have an&s;wered the Company's Purpo&s;e &s;o well,
<PB N="18" REF="013500_0018_0F90FA3CAE576F10">
in &s;everal Re&s;pects, as the Retribution now demanded on their Behalf; and the immediate Suppre&s;&s;ion of what is <HI>called</HI> a Riot might have defeated the earne&s;t Expectations of the <HI>Governor</HI> and the <HI>Revenue Officers.</HI> The Dutch we learn de&s;troy large Quantities ot their Spices, in Order to enhance the Value of what remains upon Hand. How very conve|nient would it be to tho&s;e People, could they but find out a Method of being paid for what they thus de&s;troy? I do not pre&s;ume to <HI>a&s;&s;ert</HI> po&s;itively that the Mini&s;try were con|cerned in planning and promoting the Scheme of &s;ending the Tea to America; but does it appear, in the Cour&s;e of all the Debates, we have &s;een, that they have once denied it? Does not the Act of Parliament la&s;t referred to, when com|pared with the &s;everal Mea&s;ures lately adopted, furni&s;h a &s;trong pre&s;umptive Proof that it was undertaken, at lea&s;t, with their Approbation? How could this Act have been procured without their Concurrence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance? And why were not the Company allowed to export, on their <HI>own Account,</HI> other Articles be&s;ides Tea? I &s;uppo&s;e there can be no Que&s;tion made of the Advantages they would reap by monopoli&s;ing the Exports as well as Imporrs of all the Commodities they deal in. Let the <HI>Bo&s;ton Port Act</HI> and the other <HI>Bills</HI> brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, by the Mini&s;ter, which have probably been pa&s;&s;ed into Laws before this Time, be reviewed, and then, let tho&s;e doubt, who can, whether every Step taken was not with a De&s;ign to compel the People of Bo&s;ton, in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, and after this was done, the whole Continent to &s;ubmit to the Payment of Duties impo&s;ed for the &s;ole Purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a Revenue in America, and, in &s;o doing, to the Power of Parliament in every other In&s;tance, that they may be plea&s;ed to exert it. As a farther corroborative Proof, I would gladly know whe|ther it appears, from any authentic Document, that the Company ever lodged a Complaint again&s;t the Bo&s;tonians; they &s;eem to have been either too con&s;cious of their Fault to do it; or the Readine&s;s and Alacrity, with which the Mini&s;try
<PB N="19" REF="013500_0019_0F90FA3D709D6F40">
&s;eem to have engaged in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, might have &s;uper&s;eded the Nece&s;&s;ity of their complaining.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try, it is &s;aid, <HI>took the Matter up on two Prin|ciples.</HI> They con&s;idered, in the fir&s;t Place, <HI>that the Idea en|tertained by the Bo&s;tonians of this being an Act of Government, was affrontive to the Crown and therefore de&s;erved the Ani|madver&s;ion of Parliament.</HI> The &s;econd Rea&s;on was,
<Q>that, without the Intervention of the legi&s;lative Authority, there mu&s;t be a Failure of Ju&s;tice.</Q>
It ought rather to have been &s;uppo&s;ed, under the fir&s;t Head, that the Mini&s;ter <HI>him&s;elf</HI> was affronted and vexed that the Scheme had been fru&s;trated; for I cannot help di&s;tingui&s;hing between the Crown and the Mini&s;try on the&s;e Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>In Proof of his &s;econd Rea&s;on, the Author is plea&s;ed to &s;ay,
<Q>the Ea&s;t India Company, it is true, might have brought their Actions again&s;t the Offenders; but how were they to find them? The Affair of the Ga&s;p&eacute;e afforded Proof enough that the Names of the Rioters would remain an impenetrable Secret; but, if their Names had been known, what Rea&s;on was there to expect on the Trial, a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Judge or a di&s;intere&s;ted Jury, when the Minds of the People were &s;o generally impre&s;&s;ed with the Notion, that, with the Tea, were imported Shackles for them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity?</Q>
As to the Difficulty in di&s;covering the Names of the Offenders, would this have been any Thing more than the common Ca&s;e; when either, from not being able to find out the Authors of a Mi&s;chief, or, from a Defect of Proof, the Per&s;on injured is obliged to &s;it down with the Lo&s;s? This may be a Misfortune, but, in the pre&s;ent State of human Affairs, it &s;eems unavoidable. With Re&s;pect to the Want of a proper Judge or Jury, a di&s;|pa&s;&s;ionate, impartial Judge might &s;urely have been found, either among&s;t the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms,</HI> or in one of the <HI>Courts of Admiralty</HI> on the Continent; he might have
<PB N="20" REF="013500_0020_0F90FA3E294287D0">
been inve&s;ted with the full Powers both of <HI>Judge</HI> and <HI>Jury,</HI> and &s;uch a Juri&s;diction would not have been a Whit more exceptionable, than the Powers given to Courts of Admiralty by this and &s;everal other Acts of Parliament. But the Mi|ni&s;try could have had no ju&s;t Grounds to &s;u&s;pect a Failure of Ju&s;tice; &s;everal In&s;tances had happened in <HI>that very Pro|vince</HI> &s;ufficient to convince them of the contrary.</P>
<P><Q>This Matter was, therefore, laid before Parliament, as the only Re&s;ource; who, in Con&s;equence of it, thought proper to &s;end an Armament to Bo&s;ton in Order to oblige the <HI>People</HI> of that Place to make Retribution for the Injuries <HI>they</HI> had done, and to put a Check to that growing Di&s;order, which appeared to them to be Licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, in&s;tead of Freedom, and which mu&s;t endanger the Peace of the Briti&s;h Empire in America, unle&s;s it was &s;mothered in its Infancy.</Q>
We are told farther that the <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> of Parliament was levelled only again&s;t the Town of Bo&s;ton and that, if it had been intended again&s;t the whole Province, they would have &s;topped all Commu|nication with it; that this ought to convince every one that they have no Intention to injure any other Colony, un|le&s;s they commit the &s;ame Outrage, and then, it is probable, "the &s;ame Cau&s;e will produce the &s;ame Effect." Before the Author had &s;uppo&s;ed that only the Town of Bo&s;ton and not other Parts of the Province would be affected, I wi&s;h he had read the Addre&s;s of the Town of Salem to Governor Gage and learned their Sen&s;e of this Matter; after repre&s;enting the great Injury that <HI>particular Town</HI> will &s;u&s;|tain, they tell him
<Q>that there is not a Town in the Province, but will feel the ill Effects.</Q></P>
<P>The Author is plea&s;ed to confe&s;s that
<Q>the Part of the Act, which relates to Wharfs is <HI>exceptionable,</HI> as it is taking private Property out of the Hands of the Po&s;|&s;e&s;ors, who <HI>may be innocent Men,</HI> and, perhaps, have
<PB N="21" REF="013500_0021_0F90FA3EE8A8CC58">
done nothing to <HI>forfeit</HI> their Rights.</Q> And <HI>is it, indeed,</HI> but barely <HI>exceptionable? Nothing more</HI> verily; &s;ince, in the &s;ucceeding Paragraph, we find an Apology ready prepared <HI>to ju&s;tify even this Part</HI> of the Act. The De&s;ign of the Act, it &s;eems, was only "punitory;" when that End is an&s;wered and Satisfaction made
<Q>to the Ea&s;t India Com|pany, he is per&s;uaded that the Whole will be repealed.</Q>
What are we to under&s;tand by the Term "<HI>punitory?</HI>" It may imply <HI>confi&s;cating, hanging, burning</HI>; and, what not? But taking it in the mo&s;t mollified Sen&s;e, the Author &s;urely has never read the Bo&s;ton Port Act, or mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that others have not done it, el&s;e he never would have given <HI>this as a true State of the Ca&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>What can he think of the Act's declaring void <HI>Charter Parties and Bills of Loading?</HI> What of the Clau&s;e (which may indeed carry with it an Air of Indulgence) effectually re&s;training his Maje&s;ty from opening the Port, till Peace and <HI>Obedience to the Laws</HI> are <HI>&s;o</HI> far re&s;tored in the Town of Bo&s;ton, that his Maje&s;ty's <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> may be duly collected? By <HI>Obedience to the Laws</HI> I under&s;tand an <HI>implicit Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to all <HI>Acts of Parliament whatever</HI>; by <HI>Cu&s;toms,</HI> is plainly meant <HI>all &s;uch Duties,</HI> as the Parliament may think fit to impo&s;e. This obvious Comment may fairly be made from the Complexion of the Act it&s;elf, and is clearly and fully ju&s;tified by the other Bills before alluded to.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we think of his Maje&s;ty's being al&s;o re&s;trained from opening any Part of the Port,
<Q>till full Satisfaction is made to the Ea&s;t India Company for the Damages they have &s;u&s;tained; and until it &s;hall be certified to his Maje&s;ty in Council by the Governor or Lieutenant Governour, that rea&s;onable Satisfaction hath been made to the <HI>Officers of the Revenue</HI> and <HI>others</HI> who &s;uffered by the Riots, &amp;c?</Q>

He &s;hould not be too precipitate in pronouncing the Sentiments of others. Many judicious, upright Men, who, I believe, are now fully convinced, had their Doubts, at fir&s;t, upon this Point; they &s;u&s;pended their Judgments, till they could be &s;atisfied of the Motives, which actuated the Bo&s;tonians, and of the Evidence, they might have to produce of what Part the Mini&s;try took in this Bu&s;ine&s;s at the Beginning of it. Granting, however, for a Moment, that the People of Bo&s;ton might have acted unwarrantably; yet, what hath the Parliament done? Or rather, what hath it not done? It is much to be &s;u&s;pected that the Author, as well as many others, in con&s;idering this <HI>mixed</HI> Que&s;tion, has attended only to one Side of it. Upon the above <HI>Conce&s;&s;ion,</HI> then, &s;ome of the Men of Bo&s;|ton and in its Neighbourhood have acted unwarrantably in de&s;troying the Property of the Ea&s;t India Company. In this Town live a great many Thou&s;and Inhabitants, among&s;t whom are, probably, many Widows and Orphans deeply intere&s;ted in the Trade of the Place, its Wharfs, Storehou&s;es and other Appendages. Several principal Proprietors might have been ab&s;ent, when the Fact was committed. Many of the&s;e mu&s;t be pre&s;umed entirely innocent; the Guilty however de&s;erve Puni&s;hment. The Law is open to the In|jured; and, if the Aggre&s;&s;ors can be found out, there is a proper Juri&s;diction to award &s;uch Puni&s;hment, as the Law hath pre&s;cribed. From a <HI>groundle&s;s</HI> Apprehen&s;ion (I take the Liberty of calling it &s;o, till the contrary is proved) that Ju&s;tice will not be impartially admini&s;tered, the Mini&s;|try take the Matter up and lay it before Parliament. A Bill is brought in; the Parties accu&s;ed, contrary to every Rule of Ju&s;tice, are condemned, without being cited to an&s;wer what is laid to their Charge; a few of their Friends, who happened to be on the Spot, are refu&s;ed to be heard, and an Act of Parliament, inflicting the &s;evere&s;t Penalties, is pa&s;&s;ed with unu&s;ual Precipitation; a Fleet and an Arma|ment are hurried acro&s;s the Atlantick with the utmo&s;t

<P>In the Author's pompous Di&s;play of the Beauties of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution and the Laws of Parliament, he &s;hould have recollected one very e&s;&s;ential Point more, which &s;eems to crown the Whole, and without which, the Power of Parliament would become odious to every Man of free and liberal Sentiments. What I allude to will be be&s;t explained by the following Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>To the Parliament it, of Right, belongs to make and enact Laws for the better Government of all <HI>properly within its Juri&s;diction</HI>; for the Encouragement of tho&s;e, who do well and the Puni&s;hment of all Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. If Offences &s;hould ari&s;e, not guarded again&s;t by Law, this Defect of Provi&s;ion is to be a&s;cribed either to the Neglect of the Legi&s;|lature, or to the Imbecillity and &s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s of human Nature. Every In&s;tance of this Sort &s;hould point out to the Lawgiver a <HI>future</HI> Remedy, which ought to be provided with all Expedition and without <HI>Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons.</HI> When general Regulations and Laws are e&s;tabli&s;hed, by which every Individual in Society is to be bound and governed, &s;uch Laws are <HI>equal</HI>; the Legi&s;lature acts upon truly po|litical and con&s;titutional Principles, uninfluenced by Parti|ality, <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> or the Temper of the Times. Of &s;uch Laws, as the&s;e, or rather, the <HI>Mode of enacting them,</HI> none can with Rea&s;on complain. But we &s;hould be careful never to lo&s;e Sight of the material Difference between the <HI>legi&s;lative,</HI> the <HI>judicial,</HI> and <HI>executive</HI> Parts of our Con&s;titution; &s;ince, upon a due Attention to and Ob&s;ervance of the&s;e Di&s;tinc|tions, the Pre&s;ervation of the Whole &s;o very materially de|pends.
<PB N="25" REF="013500_0025_0F90FA45198E57D8">
Occurrences prejudicial to Society may happen, which have not yet been provided again&s;t by any Law; but the&s;e cannot be puni&s;hed, without a gro&s;s Infringement of the vital Principles of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, and a direct Oppugnation to a &s;uperior Authority; by which we are taught, <HI>that, where there is no Law, there can be no Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> We know very well that, by the mo&s;t ju&s;t and invariable Rules of judging, penal Laws are to be con|&s;trued <HI>&s;trictly</HI>; &s;o that no One accu&s;ed can be &s;ubjected to a Penalty, unle&s;s he falls expre&s;sly within it. Upon what is this Rule founded? but the Rea&s;on and Principles of eternal Ju&s;tice (which Legi&s;latures as well as Judges &s;hould have imprinted on their Hearts in indelible Characters) that penal Laws ought never to be calculated, like Snares, to catch Men; on the contrary, that no One &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the Pains of them, unle&s;s clearly and fully convicted. Again; we have another Maxim in our Con&s;titution, namely, that it is better many <HI>guilty Per&s;ons</HI> &s;hould e&s;cape Puni&s;h|ment, than that one Innocent &s;hould &s;uffer. We know <HI>ten</HI> righteous Per&s;ons would <HI>once</HI> have &s;aved a whole City; but this it &s;eems is an <HI>antiquated</HI> Doctrine, extracted from a <HI>&s;trange old Hi&s;tory</HI>; and the Rever&s;e is now to take Place in the Sy&s;tem of modern Politicks. Let the&s;e Ob&s;ervations be applied to the Ca&s;e in Hand. The Per&s;ons actually guilty of the &s;uppo&s;ed Offences at Bo&s;ton were &s;ubject to <HI>the Penalties,</HI> and <HI>tho&s;e only,</HI> of the Laws then in Force; if there were no &s;uch Laws, I &s;ay they were not liable to any Penalty at all. Shew me the Law enacted by <HI>proper Au|thority,</HI> or &s;ubmitted to by immemorial U&s;age, declaring that the Port of Bo&s;ton or any other Town &s;hould be blocked up and the Trade, almo&s;t, of a whole Country de&s;troyed, even &s;uppo&s;ing all the Inabitants of the Town guilty, which is not pretended in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and I will agree that the Penalty might be legally infflicted. There are many Per&s;ons confe&s;&s;ed to be grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="26" REF="013500_0026_0F90FA45BAF473F8">
by this Act, who are perfectly innocent. Let a Law enacted by <HI>proper</HI> Authority be produced, which declares that all the Inhabitants ot Bo&s;ton or any other Town, whether inno|cent or guilty, &s;hall be puni&s;hed mo&s;t &s;everely for the Acts of Violence or Intemperance of Individuals committed either in their own Town or its Neighbourhood, and I will ki&s;s the <HI>legal Rod,</HI> and yield up the Argument; but, if no &s;uch Law can be produced, I take the Liberty to pronounce that the Bo&s;ton Port Act, con&s;idering it in a judicial Point of View, is <HI>uncon&s;titutional</HI>; that, as an Act of <HI>legi&s;lative Power,</HI> it is entirely <HI>ex po&s;t facto,</HI> in the mo&s;t odious Sen&s;e of the Words; and that, with Re&s;pect to all tho&s;e e&s;pecially, who were confe&s;&s;edly innocent, it con&s;titutes a new Crime and inflicts a Puni&s;hment, which cannot be ju&s;tified. Here, I &s;uppo&s;e, will be called into the Author's Aid, the Precedents urged on the other Side of the Water. I &s;hall not, for Brevity's Sake, quote them all; but refer my Readers to the re&s;t, with the An&s;wers given to them, contenting my&s;elf, with mentioning only two, the mo&s;t capital.</P>
<P>In the Reign of King Charles the &s;econd, when Dr. Lamb was killed by unknown Per&s;ons, the City of London was fined; and, in Captain Portius's Affair, a Fine was &s;et upon the whole City of Edinburgh. I take the Liberty of referring for an An&s;wer to the&s;e Examples, in Part, to what was urged, with much Propriety, by a few worthy, patriotic Americans in their Petition again&s;t the Bo&s;ton Port Bill. I give it in their own Words, as I would by no Means mutilate that Part of a Petition, which mu&s;t for ever endear them to all their Countrymen.
<Q>The Ca&s;e of the King again&s;t the City of London, &s;ay they, was for a Murder committed within its <HI>Walls</HI> by its Citizens in open Day. But, even then, <HI>arbitrary</HI> as the Times were, the Trial was public in a Court of Common Law; the Party heard and the Law, laid down by the Judges, was,
<PB N="27" REF="013500_0027_0F90FA4734973608">
that it was an Offence, at Common Law, to &s;uffer &s;uch a Crime to be committed in a walled Town, <HI>Tempore diurno,</HI> and none of the Offenders to be known or in|dicted. The Ca&s;e of Edinburgh, in which the Parlia|ment interfered, was the Commi&s;&s;ion of an atrocious Murder within her Gates, and aggravated by an overt Act of High Trea&s;on, in executing, again&s;t the expre&s;s Will of the Crown, the King's Laws. They ob&s;erved that the&s;e Cities had, by Charter, the whole executive Power within them&s;elves, &s;o that a Failure of Ju&s;tice nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ued from their Connivance. In both Ca&s;es, however, full <HI>Time</HI> was allowed them to di&s;charge their Duty, and they were heard in their own Defence. But Time was not allowed to the Bo&s;tonians, nor were they heard. Bo&s;ton is not a walled Town, nor is the execu|tive Power in their Hands, but in the Governor's; nor was the Fact committed within it.</Q>
The&s;e Rea&s;ons I &s;hould have thought &s;ufficient to di&s;criminate the different Ca&s;es; but my Objection is laid &s;till deeper, as I am for reducing Things to their proper Principles. Shew me the Law, <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;ting</HI> at the <HI>Time</HI> the&s;e Offences were &s;aid to have been committed, impo&s;ing the Penalties inflicted, and I will agree that &s;uch Proceedings, before a <HI>proper Judicature,</HI> might have been right; otherwi&s;e, from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Principles of the Con&s;titution, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to declare them arbitrary Exertions of de&s;potick Power. Admit but an <HI>Authority</HI> in Parliament, not only to <HI>create new Offences, after</HI> they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been committed, but to inflict what Puni&s;hments they plea&s;e for the &s;ame, and I would gladly know what will become of that Security for their Properties, their Liberties and Lives, which Engli&s;h|men boa&s;t of, as derived from the Independence of their Judges and the Permanency of Tenure, by which they enjoy their Offices. Let the Author di&s;prove my Po&s;itions, and he will make Room for <HI>con&s;tructive Trea&s;ons and Felonies</HI>; (a Doctrine long &s;ince exploded by all judicious, good Men,
<PB N="28" REF="013500_0028_0F90FA480AE137A0">
as replete with Horror;) he will repeal the famous Statute of Edward the III. long ago e&s;tabli&s;hed by other Acts of Parliament, as a Criterion and Te&s;t not to be departed from; and, above all, he will prove IRREFRAGABLY that a Man may tran&s;gre&s;s a Law, which never had Exi&s;tence. If he &s;hould tell me of the Power, or rather <HI>Omnipotence</HI> of Parliament and the Nece&s;&s;ities of State, I have to remind him that &s;uch a Power is inadmi&s;&s;ible, &s;ince it contradicts a more tran&s;cendent Authority; and that no Exigency of Government can commute for &s;o flagrant a Violation of the fir&s;t and fundamental Principles of the Con&s;titution and the &s;acred Laws of Ju&s;tice. If, in attempting to rea&s;on on the&s;e Principles, I am drawn back to the State of Nature, where, according to the old Vulgari&s;ms, <HI>Might</HI> was &s;ure to overcome <HI>Right,</HI> and, where the <HI>weake&s;t</HI> always <HI>went to the Wall,</HI> I mu&s;t drop my Pen, and go in Que&s;t of a new Topick.</P>
<P><Q>There is nothing, we are told, &s;o likely to enforce the Act, as Violence. Reparation will ever be demanded, when an Injury is received. In e&s;timating the Damages, there will always be <HI>an Article in the Account relative to that, which is wi&s;hed to be enforced</HI>; and, if we are ob|liged to pay the one, what will prevent our being forced to di&s;charge <HI>the other?</HI></Q> Here the whole Secret tran&s;|pires. What is <HI>that Article,</HI> which is wi&s;hed to be <HI>enforced,</HI> but the <HI>dete&s;table Duty on Tea?</HI> This we will agree was the <HI>primary,</HI> the <HI>principal</HI> Object. The Author &s;peaking here of Force, recalls my Attention to a former Part of his Work, which I, by no Means, intended to neglect. There we are told the "mo&s;t &s;tubborn (by which are plainly meant the unhappy Americans) mu&s;t" yield to &s;uperior "Force." This without Que&s;tion is a mo&s;t <HI>powerful and irre&s;i&s;tible</HI> Argument. A Man of &s;uperior Strength it would be imprudent in me wantonly to provoke. But, if he treats me ill; if he irritates and oppre&s;&s;es me; am I
<PB N="29" REF="013500_0029_0F90FA48B56F6D98">
bound by any Laws, human or divine, to continue my good Offices towards him, &s;o as to increa&s;e his Power of doing me farther Mi&s;chief? Prudence advi&s;es that I &s;hould le&s;&s;en my Connexions with him; and, if he proceeds to Acts of open Violence again&s;t me, Self Pre&s;ervation, the very fir&s;t Law of Nature, demands that I &s;hould defend my&s;elf to the utmo&s;t of my Power.</P>
<P>The Author's Aphori&s;m that
<Q>Friend&s;hip &s;ometimes gathers new Force and Vigour, after an Interruption of its Intercour&s;e,</Q>
may be true enough; though I think he had better have &s;et it to the Tune of <HI>Amantium Irae Amoris, &amp;c.</HI> than attempted to prove it, by his &s;ub&s;equent Prophecy; which &s;eems rather intended to keep up the alarm in Great Britain, than to an&s;wer any other Purpo&s;e. Peeping into the Womb of Time, he has di&s;covered and foretold that America will, one Day, become independent.</P>
<P>The <HI>principal, avowed Cau&s;e</HI> of the pre&s;ent rigorous Mea|&s;ures again&s;t America &s;eems to ari&s;e from a Jealou&s;y excited by an Apprehen&s;ion that we affect and aim at Independency; and we cannot gain Credit, notwith&s;tanding our explicit and mo&s;t &s;olemn A&s;&s;urances of the contrary. For my&s;elf, I do prote&s;t before God and the World, that the utmo&s;t of my Wi&s;h is, that Things may return to their old Channel, when we lived a free and happy People. This obtained, I would, with Plea&s;ure, &s;ay to each Country, ESTO PERPETUA. He had before given it as his Opinion that <HI>the Americans might argue till Doom&s;day,</HI> but that he was afraid they would find the
<Q>Parliament <HI>deaf</HI> to their Rea&s;oning and their Elo|quence unavailing;</Q>
what can he now mean by Abate|ment of <HI>Rigour</HI> on their Part, and <HI>Relaxation</HI> on ours; unle&s;s it is, that America &s;hould offer a <HI>Carte blanche,</HI> in Hopes of prevailing with Parliament to de&s;i&s;t from Puni&s;hment?</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="013500_0030_0F90FA49AA483030">The great Pains he has taken to <HI>di&s;courage Strangers</HI> from migrating to America affords another &s;trong Proof of his Regard for this Country. For my Part, I am &s;o thoroughly per&s;uaded of the JUSTICE OF OUR CAUSE, that I have no Doubt of e&s;tabli&s;hing our Liberties upon &s;o <HI>&s;ure</HI> a Founda|tion, that Strangers will applaud our generous Struggles to pre&s;erve tho&s;e precious Enjoyments and become the more anxious to &s;ettle in America, as in a Land of Freedom.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;ociation entered into, upon the Di&s;&s;olution of our A&s;&s;embly, I find hath afforded the Author a Subject for Mirth and Plea&s;antry. Whether this is a Sea&s;on for &s;uch delicious Entertainments, others will judge. Upon me they are entirely lo&s;t. I had before heard this A&s;&s;ociation found Fault with, as not being exten&s;ive enough; &s;o that I could little expect to &s;ee it ranked by any one among&s;t violent Mea&s;ures; much le&s;s, that &s;o re&s;pectable a Number of Gen|tlemen would be ridiculed for that Moderation, which, to all impartial Per&s;ons, mu&s;t afford the cleare&s;t Proof of their In|clination to live on the mo&s;t friendly Terms with their Fel|low Subjects in Great Britain. However, when the&s;e Re|&s;olutions were entered into, it was uncertain what Mea&s;ures the other Colonies would adopt; we did not know how far the Mini&s;try had been in&s;trumental in bringing &s;uch exten|&s;ive Mi&s;chiefs on our Si&s;ter Colony; nor could we fore&s;ee what farther Steps the Parliament would take. The Ea&s;t India Company was con&s;idered as extremely culpable, and therefore it was re&s;olved that they &s;hould reap as little Ad|vantage from us, as po&s;&s;ible. All their Commodities were prote&s;ted again&s;t, except Saltpetre and Spices. The&s;e Ex|ceptions were not made, from an Opinion that we could not <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> do without tho&s;e Articles. Saltpetre and Spices were con&s;idered not only as u&s;eful for various Purpo&s;es of Life, but many of them, as nece&s;&s;ary in Medicine, Cordials and other Nouri&s;hments required by &s;ick Per&s;ons. None of the A&s;&s;ociates, I believe, had Re&s;pect to their Palates; and, had
<PB N="31" REF="013500_0031_0F90FA4A2DCCAF88" MS="y">
the&s;e been their Object, I am apt to think it would have been a Foible common to them with <HI>&s;ome others,</HI> and &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>Author,</HI> at <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> would have looked on it as a venial Error and treated it with greater Indul|gence. A Re&s;olution to aboli&s;h Tea, <HI>even that on Hand,</HI> totally, was prudent and nece&s;&s;ary; as the Stocks of &s;ome People, to who&s;e Happine&s;s it &s;eems &s;o very e&s;&s;ential, would probably never have been exhau&s;ted. Great as my Fondne&s;s for this delightful Herb once was, I am now taught to con|&s;ider it as the <HI>very accur&s;ed Thing,</HI> that ought to be bani&s;hed, with Di&s;dain and Horror, from every American Society.</P>
<P>The future A&s;&s;ociations, as propo&s;ed by many of the Co|lonies, as well as mo&s;t, I believe, of our Inhabitants, become the next Objects of the Author's Animadver&s;ion. With Re&s;pect to &s;topping our Exports, there &s;eems to be a Variety of Opinions, as to the Propriety and Ju&s;tice of this Mea&s;ure; though few, whom I have conver&s;ed with, doubt the Ex|pedience and Nece&s;&s;ity of the other. The&s;e Matters, how|ever, will &s;oon be determined at a general Meeting of De|puties from the different Counties; when I make no Que&s;|tion, every Subject will be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with that Calmne&s;s and Deliberation, which its Importance may demand. Tho&s;e Gentlemen, who incline to adopt both Schemes, I dare &s;ay, are actuated by the <HI>pure&s;t</HI> Motives to the public Good. The Parliament they con&s;ider as having &s;et the Example in &s;top|ing both Imports and Exports to and from the Town of Bo&s;ton. If the Parliament con&s;iders the Advantages of Trade to that Town in &s;o very intere&s;ting a Light, as to &s;uppo&s;e that, rather than forego &s;uch great Emoluments, the Inhabitants will &s;ubmit to any Acts of Oppre&s;&s;ion; the Advocates for promoting both the&s;e Mea&s;ures, knowing the almo&s;t un&s;peakable Benefits, which Great Britain derives from her Trade with the Colonies, give it, as their Opinion, that &s;he will be equally attentive to her own Intere&s;t and the &s;ooner prevailed with to &s;horten her out&s;tretched Arm, and
<PB N="32" REF="013500_0032_0F90FA4BA1D42FD0" MS="y">
do the Americans Ju&s;tice. Stopping of Exports from one Country indebted to another, where &s;he has u&s;ually traded, may lay individual Creditors under temporary Inconvenien|cies and Hard&s;hips, and can be ju&s;tified only in Ca&s;es of the extreme&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity. If, however, the Safety of a Commu|nity depends upon its being done, the <HI>Salus Populi</HI> then be|comes <HI>&s;uprema Lex.</HI> Tho&s;e, who think their Liberties, their Properties, their every Thing, dear and valuable, at Stake, and in the mo&s;t imminent Danger of being wre&s;ted from them, can have but little <HI>Spirit</HI> or Inclination to labour and toil for their Creditors, e&s;pecially, if they with-hold their <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> in endeavouring to relieve them from Oppre&s;&s;ion. They ought however, in Ju&s;tice, to pay their Debts with Intere&s;t, &s;o &s;oon as it may be in their Power; and they &s;hould be ready and willing to give up &s;o much of their Property, if required, as will di&s;charge them <HI>immediately.</HI> It is, after all that can be &s;aid, a very delicate Point. The Honour of the Country, which ought ever to be held &s;acred, may po&s;|&s;ibly be impeached and reflected upon by &s;uch, as are Stran|gers to the governing Motives; but, as a Man is &s;atisfied or not of the Purity and Uprightne&s;s of his <HI>own</HI> Intentions, his Con&s;cience will either acquit or condemn him. What I &s;hould think might, in a great Mea&s;ure, &s;atisfy the mo&s;t rigid Ca&s;ui&s;t, that nothing ba&s;e can lie at the Bottom of &s;uch a Scheme, if it is adopted, is, that the engaging in and ad|hering to it mu&s;t require the greate&s;t Sacrifice of private In|tere&s;ts and the mo&s;t vigorous Exertions of public Virtue.</P>
<P>The Non-importation Plan, no One can with Rea&s;on object to; not even the warme&s;t and mo&s;t virulent Advocate for mini&s;terial Mea&s;ures. As a free Man, I &s;urely have a Right to <HI>buy</HI> or <HI>import,</HI> and <HI>refrain</HI> from both, if I plea&s;e; in the Exerci&s;e of this Privilege I &s;hall tran&s;gre&s;s, notwith|&s;tanding the Declarations of a late <HI>unprecedented Proclamation,</HI> no Law divine or human. If &s;uch a Proclamation, denoun|cing the heavie&s;t Pains and Penalties, can be ju&s;tified; I

&s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a peremptory Mandate &s;ent over to America, commanding every Man to plant &s;o many Thou&s;and Tobacco Hills, &amp;c. &amp;c. for the Enhancement of the Revenue, the Encouragement and Advancement of the Shipping and Trade of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Stoping of Imports only I am hopeful might have all the good Effects, we wi&s;h for; but, &s;hould I be di&s;ap|pointed in this, and our Exports be &s;till continued, as u&s;ual; I &s;hall have to lament mo&s;t &s;everely that both Mea&s;ures were not adopted. The Schemes united mo&s;t certainly would, and it is probable that either of them will affect the Inhabi|tants of Great Britain of every Cla&s;s, in a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Manner. Tho&s;e, who think the Trade&s;men and Mechanicks only will &s;uffer, &s;eem to have taken but a partial View of the Ca&s;e. There is &s;o intimate and nice a Connection be|tween the different Branches of Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s of every Kind in that Country, that few of them can be affected without the Whole bearing &s;ome Proportion of whatever Lo&s;s may be &s;u&s;tained. The <HI>Landholder,</HI> and the <HI>Merchant</HI> will feel the Inconvenience, as well as the Trade&s;man and Me|chanick. When the Intere&s;t of all <HI>the&s;e</HI> comes to be worked upon, <HI>they</HI> will be convinced that the oppre&s;&s;ive Schemes of the Mini&s;try could not be enforced without the Concurrence of <HI>their</HI> Repre&s;entatives in Parliament; they will, it is hop|ed, be excited, not to Acts of Violence, but to a <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>&s;ea&s;onable</HI> Exertion of that <HI>con&s;titutional Influence</HI> and <HI>Autho|rity,</HI> which they have a Right to exerci&s;e. Should their Endeavours to relieve America from her Di&s;tre&s;&s;es be with|held, whatever Inconveniencies they may be put to, the Colonies mu&s;t &s;urely be acquitted by every impartial Judge. Much le&s;s Rea&s;on can they have to complain, if &s;toping Exports to Great Britain is po&s;tponed to a di&s;tant, future Day; this will give &s;ufficient Notice of what they may ex|pect; a great Part of the American Debts will certainly be
<PB N="34" REF="013500_0034_0F90FA4C6993B8F8">
di&s;charged, and the Re&s;ources the Colonies will have left, if they are <HI>permitted</HI> to draw from them, will, in all Proba|bility, enable them to pay off the full Balance in a rea&s;onable Time. Let America but &s;top her <HI>importing Hand</HI>; apply a proper Share of her Indu&s;try to Manufactures, and the re&s;t of her Labour to cultivating and rai&s;ing &s;uch Articles, as &s;he is allowed to export to other Markets, and I have the mo&s;t &s;anguine Expectations that &s;he will, not only very &s;peedily extricate her&s;elf from Debt, but find the Balance con&s;iderably in her Favour. Should &s;he, by the <HI>Hand of Power,</HI> be laid under farther Re&s;trictions in her Trade, and by this Means any Part of her Debt remain un&s;atisfied, the Fault will not be <HI>her</HI>'s. So that every Sugge&s;tion of a De&s;ign in the Coloni&s;ts to <HI>extingui&s;h</HI> the &s;malle&s;t Portion of their Debts mu&s;t appear groundle&s;s and unju&s;t. I know it has been in&s;inuated, with a View to fix an Odium on the Co|lonies, that they have failed in former Engagements to &s;atisfy their Creditors; but this, con&s;idered as an Accu&s;ation on the whole Continent, as it mu&s;t have been intended, I am convinced is without Foundation. That &s;ome Individuals may have remained in Debt for a Number of Years and that In&s;olvencies may have happened in America, as well as <HI>Great Britain,</HI> I will not deny; but chief of the old Balan|ces, I make no Doubt, have been long &s;ince paid off, and that the Debts, now due, have been mo&s;tly contracted &s;ince in a Cour&s;e of Trade <HI>equally,</HI> if not <HI>more,</HI> advantageous to the Briti&s;h Merchants and Traders, than to the Coloni&s;ts. For the Truth, at lea&s;t Probability of this, I appeal to the various Solicitations and <HI>Allurements</HI> held out, particularly to <HI>my Countrymen,</HI> to engage and continue in this Trade. The Balance again&s;t America proves clearly on which Side the Advantage has been.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s the Author is prepared for a Di&s;appointment, I would not have him depend too much on his pre&s;ent Opinion of the propo&s;ed A&s;&s;ociation compared with <HI>that</HI> entered into

&s;ome Years ago. I have already hinted &s;ome of the Rea|&s;ons why <HI>this</HI> was neglected; but I am convinced he will find a quite different Spirit prevailing throughout America at this Time. Tho&s;e <HI>Diver&s;ities</HI> of Opinions and <HI>Differences</HI> of Intere&s;t, which formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, will now, I am per|&s;uaded, be &s;acrificed to the Good of the Whole. Whether the Duty on Tea was, at fir&s;t, con&s;idered as an internal Tax or not, is now quite immaterial. The De&s;igns of the Mini&s;try were not then &s;een through by many; but I think I have &s;hewn clearly that this Duty had originally every <HI>odious Feature</HI> of &s;uch a Tax. Can a Doubt now remain, when we find an <HI>Armament</HI> &s;ent either to enforce the Pay|ment of it or to puni&s;h mo&s;t &s;everely tho&s;e, who refu&s;e to do it? Such a Refu&s;al, as this, the Author would con&s;true into a Re&s;i&s;tance of the Authority of Parliament to lay Duties on their <HI>own Commodities,</HI> which we do not wi&s;h to que&s;tion, when it is <HI>really</HI> done as a <HI>commercial Regulation.</HI> I grant, it makes no Difference to me, <HI>as to the Quantum of the Tax,</HI> whether it is paid in Great Britain or the Colonies; whether my Merchant pays it for me, or whether I do it my&s;elf; but Circum&s;tances will make that oppre&s;&s;ive in one Ca&s;e, which would be almo&s;t indifferent in another. I have neither paid this Tax my&s;elf nor allowed my Merchant to do it for me, &s;ince the U&s;e of Tea was re&s;olved again&s;t in America; and, which is &s;till more, I never will pay it.</P>
<P>The Mention of a Precedent, our Author, in the Abun|dance of his Politene&s;s, tells us is <HI>ridiculous</HI>; and we are referred to the Li&s;t of his <HI>favourite Duties</HI> to &s;ee whether there has been any Want of Examples. That America hath acquie&s;ced in and paid former <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;ome of the&s;e merely internal, I do not deny; but &s;he did not di&s;cover their dangerous Tendency till, within the&s;e few Years, her Eyes were clearly opened by farther Encroachments. Why mu&s;t the Mention of <HI>Precedents</HI> be ridiculous, when we find they were &s;trenuou&s;ly relied on by the Mini&s;ter, and all
<PB N="36" REF="013500_0036_0F90FA4DF1475370" MS="y">
his Advocates, to ju&s;tify the Stamp Act, and are <HI>&s;till quoted</HI> as <HI>Authorities</HI> to rivet Chains about our Necks? Is it not high Time for America to look about her and not &s;uffer ancient <HI>Precedents</HI> to acquire additional Weight from others more recent? We are again reminded of the <HI>Power</HI> of Parliament to enforce &s;uch Duties, as they may think expedient; and are told that America will refu&s;e the Pay|ment of them, <HI>whenever &s;he is able.</HI> Is it not &s;trange that a Gentleman, who profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;o great a Friend to lenient Mea&s;ures, &s;hould, at every Turn, take &s;o much Pains to remind Parliament of its &s;uperior Power, and <HI>flatter</HI> America that &s;he will, one Day, be able, and cer|tainly will re&s;i&s;t it? Is not this the mo&s;t direct and &s;ure&s;t Method of &s;owing the Seeds of perpetual Di&s;cord? We are advi&s;ed <HI>truly</HI> for the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> to <HI>affect</HI> a Submi&s;&s;ion; but &s;till are to harbour in <HI>our</HI> Brea&s;ts the Poi&s;on of Di&s;content and Animo&s;ity, which mu&s;t fe&s;ter and rankle to &s;uch a Degree, that they will, at a future Day, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly bur&s;t forth with redoubled Violence and Fury. Whether &s;uch Sentiments, as the&s;e, are likely to prove inimical or friendly to either Country, let them both judge. The Author widely mi&s;takes what the true and real Friends of America hope to have done. They do not de&s;ire to leave every Thing to Po&s;terity, but rather wi&s;h to have Matters <HI>now</HI> &s;ettled upon &s;uch Principles, as will lay a &s;trong and broad Foundation of Concord and reciprocal Friend&s;hip, never more to be interrupted.</P>
<P>As to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> up the Courts of Ju&s;tice; it is a Mea&s;ure, I own, that cannot be ju&s;tified, but in Ca&s;es of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity. If, however, the Magi&s;trates, who act on Oath, think they cannot proceed in Bu&s;ine&s;s without a Fee Bill, what would the Author have them do more, than exerci&s;e that Part of their Office, which is nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve the Peace and good Order of Society? This I under|&s;tand is univer&s;ally re&s;olved on throughout the Country.
<PB N="37" REF="013500_0037_0F90FA4EA6450710">
That the Fee Bill has expired is a Circum&s;tance we lament and ought not to be blamed for. Before he cen&s;ured the Magi&s;tates &s;o very &s;everely for declining to &s;it, he would have done well to con&s;ider how far he <HI>him&s;elf</HI> coincided. If I am not mi&s;taken, this Gentleman holds a Seat in one or more Courts of Ju&s;tice; he &s;hould let us know what Part he took to prevent the Occlu&s;ion of tho&s;e Courts, and then, perhaps, his Arguments would have more Weight.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;ociation he would recommend is that we &s;hould all unite in <HI>Virtue; public Virtue,</HI> he is careful to tell us he <HI>means,</HI> le&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e, we &s;hould put too great a Value on the other. <HI>Public Virtue</HI> is what we earne&s;tly wi&s;h to <HI>rou&s;e</HI> and <HI>excite</HI> in every American Brea&s;t; &s;ince, without it, we may probably &s;uffer in the very be&s;t of Cau&s;es. But why is private Virtue &s;o low in his E&s;teem? Without this, the other, in my Judgment, is like the <HI>ba&s;ele&s;s Fabrick of a Vi&s;ion.</HI> If a Man is not <HI>ju&s;t to him&s;elf,</HI> I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e he will be &s;o to others, upon any trying Emergency. What is called <HI>public Virtue,</HI> unle&s;s built on <HI>private Virtue,</HI> will become too precarious and un&s;table to be relied on. A Man, with a &s;mall Stock of private Virtues, may, in|deed, as his Intere&s;t governs, do a Thing, from which the Public may reap Advantage; &s;hift but the Scene; let his Intere&s;t draw in a different Direction, and we &s;hall find him, <HI>Proteus like,</HI> put on a new Livery. It may be relied on as a certain Truth, exemplified by the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Experience, that no Man can be &s;afely tru&s;ted, who does not act upon <HI>&s;olid, virtuous</HI> Principles. We are advi&s;ed to apply our&s;elves <HI>quietly</HI> to the Cultivation of our Soil; but how can this be done without the <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> of a <HI>&s;uperior</HI> Power? How can it with Rea&s;on, be expected that we &s;hould labour, unle&s;s we are <HI>kindly</HI> allowed to reap and enjoy the Fruits of our Toil?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="013500_0038_0F90FA51CD4BE288">
<Q>Our public Happine&s;s, we are told, depends on the People;</Q>
granted that it does in a great Mea&s;ure. Had the Author added to his Li&s;t of Qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to make a proper Repre&s;entative, that he ought to be a Man of <HI>private</HI> as well <HI>as public Virtue</HI>; One who <HI>really loves his Country,</HI> and would &s;upport her true Intere&s;t, even though he &s;hould be forced to &s;acrifice <HI>every &s;ini&s;ter, &s;elfi&s;h Con&s;idera|tion,</HI> it would have made the Catalogue nearly <HI>complete</HI>; but I &s;hould like it &s;till better, if a proper <HI>Re&s;pect</HI> and <HI>Re|verence for Religion</HI> were required as an e&s;&s;ential Part of the Character.</P>
<P>I am now led to take a View of the Author's very curious and decent Strictures on the Fa&s;t, which was recommended by the late Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es to the Members. Upon this Subject, he &s;eems to have opened every Vein of paltry Ridi|cule; but &s;urely he hath either &s;trangely mi&s;taken, or pro|fanely applied his Talent. He might have learned from one of tho&s;e great Ma&s;ters, under who&s;e Au&s;pices he probably was <HI>nurtured,</HI> that <HI>Ridicule is the Te&s;t</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> and thought this a fit Opportunity to di&s;play it with Advantage. A Stranger, from his Repre&s;entation, would &s;uppo&s;e that we had acted a <HI>ridiculous Farce,</HI> in&s;tead of what was &s;o &s;olemnly recommended. Though the Author had lo&s;t Sight of all Decorum, he &s;hould, at lea&s;t, have confined him&s;elf to the Rules of Ju&s;tice. I beg to know of him in who&s;e Hou&s;es tho&s;e <HI>&s;umptuous Suppers,</HI> he alludes to, were &s;erved up at Night. I am &s;ure I neither &s;aw nor heard any Thing of the Sort. Tho&s;e, who had fa&s;ted through the Day, it was &s;up|po&s;ed would refre&s;h them&s;elves in the Evening. Nature re|quired and Decency did not forbid it. It could hardly have been expected, even by the mo&s;t <HI>indigent,</HI> (who it &s;eems have <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> become Objects of his <HI>great Care</HI>) that the Calls and Cravings of Nature &s;hould have remained unan|&s;wered. Savings, indeed, in In&s;tances of Superfluity and <HI>pompous Parade,</HI> may properly be expected, as well towards
<PB N="39" REF="013500_0039_0F90FA53034DE2E0">
their Relief, as the Satisfaction of all other ju&s;t Demands. He has exceedingly mi&s;taken the Matter, in &s;uppo&s;ing that the <HI>Authors</HI> of the Mea&s;ure either wi&s;hed for his <HI>Commenda|tions</HI> or to be tickled by his <HI>Flatteries.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Fa&s;ting, we are told, when ob&s;erved and repeated in a proper Manner, may be &s;alutary to the natural Body;</Q>
(thus much no Doubt he collected from Experience;)
<Q>but how the political body can be benefited by changing the Hour of dining and making the Repa&s;t in the Evening, in&s;tead of the Afternoon (which was all that was required on the late Occa&s;ion, except the Circum&s;tances of attend|ing the public Wor&s;hip, in which, in&s;tead of a Form compo&s;ed for the Purpo&s;e, the ordinary Service of the Day was read) is what he cannot account for.</Q>
Not to be tedious in u&s;ele&s;s Quotations, I mu&s;t refer the Reader to &s;ome other of his very <HI>pretty</HI> Ob&s;ervations that follow. As he &s;eems little acquainted with the Rea&s;ons for &s;etting apart particular Days for &s;olemn <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> on any Occa|&s;ion, and the Motives, which governed on a late one, I will take the Liberty to expre&s;s my Sen&s;e of both.</P>
<P>There are <HI>many,</HI> it is to be hoped, (<HI>would</HI> GOD there were <HI>more</HI>) who do not con&s;ider this as a poor, <HI>Orphan World,</HI> di&s;charged, &s;o &s;oon as it was called into Being, from the <HI>Care, Superintendence,</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> of its <HI>all-wi&s;e, and bountiful</HI> CREATOR. Things, in <HI>general,</HI> they know are left to pur&s;ue their ordinary Cour&s;e, in Conformity to the Laws of their Nature; but &s;till, they con&s;ider the whole World as under the Direction of PROVIDENCE. They have been taught that not even a <HI>Sparrow falleth to the Ground,</HI> without the <HI>Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> of their <HI>heavenly</HI> FATHER. They are enjoined not only to pray, but to be <HI>in&s;tant in Prayer,</HI> for his <HI>Mercies</HI> and <HI>Protection.</HI> Upon the&s;e Principles is founded and e&s;tabli&s;hed, by <HI>Authority,</HI> the Service of our excellent Church, which I would recommend to the Author's <HI>more</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="013500_0040_0F90FA532D0709E0">
&s;erious Con&s;ideration. Not only Individuals, but, in a more e&s;pecial Manner, <HI>Nations</HI> and <HI>Countries,</HI> as having their Exi&s;tence <HI>&s;olely</HI> in this Life, have been con&s;idered by all Ages, and particularly by all good Chri&s;tians, as under the Guidance of Heaven. In Ca&s;es of general Calamity, either already felt or apprehended, what can be more decent and proper than to look up to that Providence, who we are in&s;tructed to believe ruleth the <HI>Hearts of Kings</HI> and <HI>Governors,</HI> according to his good Plea&s;ure, and to implore the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Ble&s;&s;ings of his <HI>fatherly Goodne&s;s</HI>; at the &s;ame Time making U&s;e of all tho&s;e <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>proper Means,</HI> which he either hath been, or may be plea&s;ed to afford us for our Protection. Previous, however, to <HI>this,</HI> we &s;hould be extremely careful to examine our Hearts; to endeavour at a Reformation of whatever may be found ami&s;s; to repent <HI>heartily</HI> of all our Sins and to prepare our Minds for the Reception of the Influences of his GOOD SPIRIT. Can any Means be better adapted to this End, than withdrawing our Attention, for a Sea&s;on, from the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Cares of the World, and mortifying all our <HI>corrupt Affections</HI> by FASTING and PRAYER? To &s;uppo&s;e that any good Effect could have been expected from the <HI>mere po&s;tponing a Dinner,</HI> to u&s;e the Author's polite Phra&s;e, would have been <HI>ridiculous.</HI> I have too much Rea&s;on to believe that the De&s;ign of this <HI>Fa&s;t</HI> was either mi&s;under&s;tood or mi&s;repre&s;ented from the fir&s;t, having been informed that it was &s;poke of by &s;ome as a Scheme calculated to <HI>inflame</HI> and excite an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tic</HI> Zeal in the Minds of the People, under a Cloak of Religion; than which nothing could be more <HI>calumnious</HI> and <HI>unju&s;t.</HI> The Author mu&s;t know that the Re&s;olution was not <HI>&s;muggled,</HI> but propo&s;ed in a very <HI>full Hou&s;e,</HI> not above one Di&s;&s;entient appearing among&s;t near an Hundred Members. He, him&s;elf, I believe was pre&s;ent, and &s;hould be glad to know whether he opened his Mouth again&s;t the Mea&s;ure? Surely he could not want that <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> he &s;o earne&s;tly recommends, to have
<PB N="41" REF="013500_0041_0F90FA53E818FBF0">
avowed his <HI>Di&s;approbation.</HI> The mixing of Religion with civil Matters, merely to inflame People's Minds, I know has been practi&s;ed on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, but I have ever con&s;idered it not only as culpable, but extremely wicked. It gave me Pain to find that the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> of the Hou&s;e was con&s;idered as reflecting upon our gracious Sovereign. Nothing, I hope and believe, was farther from the Intention of tho&s;e, who voted for the Fa&s;t, than this. I &s;peak po&s;i|tively for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Minds of many People, e&s;pecially of their Repre|&s;entatives, were a good Deal agitated, at a former Se&s;&s;ion upon receiving an Account of the Act of Parliament re&s;pect|ing Rhode I&s;land, and for the Rea&s;ons before given. When the Bo&s;ton Port Act appeared at the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, the general Unea&s;ine&s;s, that prevailed mu&s;t be remembered. Many Expedients were thought of and the Mea&s;ure propo&s;ed was the Re&s;ult of much Deliberation. Its primary Object I have endeavoured to explain; but there were others of a &s;econdary Nature. So far from de&s;igning to inflame, I believe it was expected that the Generality of People would be brought to a <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> Sen&s;e of their Danger; the Conduct they ought to hold; and, at the &s;ame Time, that it would be a Means of re&s;training them from Acts of Violence and Intemperance. It was, with much Plea&s;ure, I ob&s;erved that the&s;e Effects were produced. Another good Influence it might have been expected to have, was, that certain GREAT MEN of this Earth might be brought to a proper Sen&s;e of that Ju&s;tice, which is due to all their <HI>Fellow Subjects,</HI> by reminding <HI>them</HI> that there is a <HI>&s;uperior Power, even a</HI> GOD IN HEAVEN, to whom they will be one Day accountable for all their Actions. As to the ordinary Service of the Church being only performed on the Oc|ca&s;ion; the late Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es mu&s;t think them|&s;elves peculiarly unfortunate in fallling under the Author's
<PB N="42" REF="013500_0042_0F90FA54A7129810">
Cen&s;ure for this. They did not <HI>pre&s;ume</HI> to de&s;ire that any <HI>Additions</HI> &s;hould be made to that <HI>&s;acred Office,</HI> which they knew was properly adapted to every Purpo&s;e. They did not wi&s;h that any Thing particularly <HI>pointed</HI> or <HI>inflamma|tory</HI> &s;hould fall from the Pulpit. A general Di&s;play of the Superintendence of Providence, and the <HI>Influence,</HI> which a thorough <HI>Conviction</HI> and <HI>Remembrance</HI> of <HI>this,</HI> ought to have, together with an implicit Reliance on his Goodne&s;s, were the Doctrines, which they de&s;ired to have inculcated, leaving the Congregation to their own Reflections in making proper Applications. The People of Bo&s;ton will have no Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that it was our De&s;ign to <HI>fob them off, in their unhappy Situation, with Fa&s;ting and Prayer.</HI> They will <HI>&s;oon</HI> be informed, if they have not heard it already, how very cordially we &s;ympathi&s;e with them in their Di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, and that we are exerting every Means, in our Power, for their Relief. Should we, indeed, pur&s;ue his Advice, it would be <HI>fobbing them off</HI> with a <HI>Witne&s;s.</HI> The Author, not having profe&s;&s;edly entered upon that long agitated <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> re&s;pecting the <HI>Authority</HI> of Parliament to tax the Colonies, I am very willing to re&s;t the Point upon what <HI>hath</HI> been already written by abler Pens, much to my Satisfaction, and to my thorough Conviction that they have <HI>no &s;uch Authority.</HI></P>
<P>At length he draws to a Conclu&s;ion and tells us that he has
<Q>&s;poke pretty much in Generals, but, if called upon, can de&s;cend to Particulars.</Q>
It would have been obliging to the Public, if he had favoured them with any farther <HI>material</HI> Ob&s;ervations; but what can he have left un&s;aid, that would an&s;wer his Purpo&s;e? That he is determined to act with <HI>Caution,</HI> none, I believe, will doubt; but I have lived to &s;ee &s;ome very <HI>cautious</HI> Per&s;ons fall through their <HI>deepe&s;t Schemes.</HI> Could the Author &s;up|po&s;e that tho&s;e &s;ervile, dangerous Doctrines, he hath ad|vanced, would remain unnoticed? With what Ju&s;tice or
<PB N="43" REF="013500_0043_0F90FA556724B4C8" MS="y">
Propriety could he pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure what he is plea&s;ed to call the <HI>Severity of &s;ome Men's Tempers,</HI> when he &s;o roundly charges tho&s;e, who differ from him in Sentiments, with Want of "Integrity;" with the "Arts of <HI>Di&s;&s;imu|lation</HI>" and almo&s;t every Species of Ba&s;ene&s;s? Could he flatter him&s;elf that "<HI>Men of Sen&s;e</HI>" would not ea&s;ily &s;ee through his "Deception," and, as ea&s;ily, di&s;tingui&s;h it from "<HI>Reality,</HI>" notwith&s;tanding the &s;olemn Appeal he makes to that <HI>great</HI>
<Q>Day, when the Actions of all Men will be fully di&s;covered, <HI>and their Integrity known?</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is more than probable that a Reply will be attempted to what I have written. Should it contain any Species of Rea&s;oning, worthy of Con&s;ideration, perhaps it may engage my farther Attention; otherwi&s;e, I &s;hall indulge a &s;ilent, contemptuous Indifference; quite impregnable to every A&s;|&s;ault of <HI>affected</HI> Wit or Ridicule; tho&s;e very <HI>de&s;picable Things,</HI> for which I acknowledge my&s;elf to have neither Ta&s;te nor Talents, e&s;pecially in a Cau&s;e of &s;o &s;erious and important a Nature.</P>
<P>I <HI>chearfully accord</HI> with the Author's Wi&s;hes, that <HI>America</HI> may be re&s;tored to
<Q>the &s;ame Situation, in which it was, when our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign a&s;cended the Imperial Throne of his Royal Ance&s;tors.</Q>
It is, farther, my mo&s;t ardent <HI>Prayer</HI> that all tho&s;e unhapy Differences, which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>America</HI> may &s;peedily &s;ub|&s;ide and be buried in <HI>eternal Oblivion</HI>; that a <HI>perfect Recon|ciliation</HI> and <HI>inviolable Friend&s;hip</HI> may be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the mo&s;t <HI>permanent Foundations,</HI> and, that both Countries may enjoy the <HI>inexhau&s;tible Sweets</HI> of <HI>con&s;titutional Freedom</HI> and <HI>Liberty,</HI> till <HI>Time</HI> &s;hall be <HI>no more.</HI></P>
