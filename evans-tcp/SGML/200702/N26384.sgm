<HEAD>LETTER I. <HI>BELINDA BLACKET,</HI> to <HI>LOUISA LENOX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN you quitted the &s;moaky capital, to retire to your delicious re&s;idence in Northumberland, you enjoined me, my dear Loui&s;a&punc; to become a con&s;tant corre&s;|pondent. The reque&s;t was &s;o con&s;onant to my inclinations, that I yielded to it with alacrity; but I am not without my appre|hen&s;ions that you will be wearied with the length and number of my epi&s;tles. I &s;latter my&s;elf, however, that our friend&s;hip is e&s;tabli&s;hed on &s;o firm a ba&s;is, that you will forgive what you cannot approve, and give me credit for my good intentions, &s;hould I tre&s;pa&s;s with prolixity or impertinence.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035084_0003_100007F7741FD388">You know, my Loui&s;a, all the &s;ecrets of my heart. Con&s;idering you as my &s;ceond &s;elf, I have ever communicated to you the particulars of my thoughts, words, and ac|tions; hitherto, indeed, my life has been unchequered with the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, and hardly furni&s;hes an intere&s;ting &s;cene; but I am re&s;olved to be no longer unnoticed in the world&mdash;no longer con&s;idered as a mere blank in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">!</P>
<P>I need not inform you, that I am this day entering into my eighteenth year; and you will, without accu&s;ing me of vanity, admit that I am not very defective in per&s;on or ac|compli&s;hments. Do not con&s;ider this, my Loui&s;a, as an eulogiu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> on my&s;elf&punc; but rather as a reflection on the in&s;en&s;ibility of the men; for I have never received a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ngle over|ture from any of the &s;ex: I therefore, am determined, in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf to compel them to pay attention to me: and I dare venture to flatter my&s;elf that before many days are expired. I &s;hall behold half a dozen of the&s;e lords of the creation, &s;ighing at my feet.</P>
<P>This may appear romantic to you, with|out further explanation; but my &s;cheme is very practicable, though it may be thought to deviate, in &s;ome degree, from the delica|cy of my &s;ex. Be that as it may, hazard it I will, regardle&s;s of the cen&s;ures of the
<PB N="5" REF="035084_0004_100007FE701CF0B8">
world, if my Loui&s;a &s;hould but approve the &s;tep.</P>
<P>Beauty, like any other mercantile com|modity, is become an article of traffic in our daily prints; adverti&s;ements indi&s;criminate|ly announce the bargain and &s;ale of a lady's per&s;on, or a bale of &s;ilk; and direct the readers whither they are to repair to treat for the affections of a lady, with as little re&s;erve as if &s;he had been a hog&s;head of &s;ugar, or any other common article of commerce.</P>
<P>Taught, therefore, by example, I intend, to pur&s;ue the &s;ame mode. The WORLD &s;hall be the vehicle for my adverti&s;ement; it is read by all the world, and will probably produce me many &s;uitors. The addre&s;s I propo&s;e, &s;hall be nearly in the following words.</P>
<P><Q>A young lady, pretty far advanced in her teens, thus publicly appeals to the young gentlemen of this kingdom. She has not the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on to accu&s;e Na|ture for not embelli&s;hing her per&s;on; and Fortune, &s;he admits, has been equally liberal to her. Acquired accompli&s;hments, &s;he al&s;o flatters her&s;elf, &s;he has a compe|tent &s;hare of; and her di&s;po&s;ition has generally been thought amiable. Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e perfections, which are far from being exaggerated, &s;he has not been
<PB N="6" REF="035084_0005_0FFFB4F34A2D31B0">
a&s;ked the material que&s;tion by any man living. Thus circum&s;tanced, &s;he candid|ly acknowledges that a &s;tate of virginity is &s;o irk&s;ome to her, that &s;he would willingly exchange it for a better. Propo&s;als, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to Belinda, &s;ealed up, and left at the Bar of the London Coffeehou&s;e, &s;hall be duly attended to, and an interview appointed, if the propo&s;als appear ade|quate to the lady's expectations.</Q></P>
<P>Blame me not Loui&s;a, for forming a re&s;o|lution of this kind; for be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall act with the utmo&s;t prudence and decorum in the whole of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Never &s;hall Loui&s;a have the lea&s;t occa&s;ion to blu&s;h for her affectionate friend,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. <HI>LOUISA LENOX,</HI> to <HI>BELINDA BLACKET.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU a&s;toni&s;h me, my dear Belinda, by the re&s;olution which you have formed. Be not too precipitate in the execution of
<PB N="7" REF="035084_0006_1000080502FFF5A8">
&s;uch a romantic plan! Excu&s;e me, deare&s;t girl, for taking the freedom of a friend.&mdash; Suffer me to expo&s;tulate a little with you, on the impropriety of expo&s;ing your per&s;on, to the wanton &s;neers of a rude rabble; for &s;uch will a&s;&s;uredly be the fellows who make application for your fair hand, in con&s;e|quence of the adverti&s;ement. I tremble for the con&s;equences of &s;uch a procedure, and conjure you, if you value my friend&s;hip, to let the idea peri&s;h whil&s;t it is in embryo.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my Belinda, very few &s;erious applications are made to ladies of your age. I am indeed half a year older than you are, and I &s;hould look upon any matrimonial overtures as an in&s;ult to my under&s;tanding; and rather an attack upon my inexperience, than a ju&s;tifiable claim to my affections. Your per&s;on and talents are &s;ufficient to cap|tivate the riche&s;t and mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of the &s;ex; and, in due time, will certainly be attended to. The men are not tho&s;e indif|ferent beings you would repre&s;ent them; but hitherto you have mixed but little with the world; like a reclu&s;e, you have pa&s;&s;ed a few &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, in pious attendance on an infirm and ancient parent, who is now no more. The fine&s;t pictures, when not ex|hibited, are unknown to the connoi&s;&s;eurs; but where your &s;emblance appears, every man mu&s;t be an <HI>amateur.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035084_0007_10000811DCE6A2C8">You are now emerging from the chamber of &s;ickne&s;s and de&s;olation, and will natural|ly receive and pay vi&s;its among the circle of your friends. Chance, my dear, will &s;oon introduce objects worthy of your e&s;teem, who will, doubtle&s;s pay their court to &s;uch beauty and excellence as belong to my Be|linda. Why, therefore, &s;hould you have recour&s;e to &s;uch expedients as even the de|&s;erted and abandoned almo&s;t de&s;pi&s;e?</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my Belinda, how &s;oon a female reputation receives a blemi&s;h; and, when once &s;ullied, how difficult, nay how impo&s;|&s;ible, it is to remove that blemi&s;h. A &s;ingle erroneous &s;tep, or a &s;tep, even bordering up|on error, will, by the cen&s;orious public, be magnified into a crime; and my poor, in|nocent Belinda, by di&s;regarding appearances, being con&s;cious of her own purity and integ|rity, may incur the calumny of malignant tongues, and lo&s;e the mo&s;t valuable jewel upon earth, a "<HI>good name.</HI>"</P>
<P>I am too young to a&s;&s;ume the character of a grave advi&s;er, and you may probably be &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o &s;erious a lecture from one who is de&s;titute of grey hairs. Had you re|que&s;ted my opinion re&s;pecting the fa&s;hion of a ribband, or any other article of dre&s;s and the <HI>ton,</HI> I would have an&s;wered you with my u&s;ual plea&s;antry, and you &s;hould have
<PB N="9" REF="035084_0008_0FFFB8016F0640F8">
found your Loui&s;a as &s;prightly and frolick|&s;ome as ever. <HI>Vive la Bagatelle!</HI>&mdash;But, where your reputation and future happine&s;s in life, are the objects of con&s;ideration, my years appear to double upon me, and I think my&s;elf as well qualified for a pre|ceptor, as a Seneca, or a Solon.</P>
<P>You have not been acca&s;tomed, my dear Belinda, to &s;uch epi&s;tles as the&s;e from your Loui&s;a. Often have you termed me, in the pur&s;uit of our innocent <HI>extravagances,</HI> your <HI>little madcap.</HI> Hereafter I &s;uppo&s;e you will think me entitled to the appellation of <HI>your</HI> philo&s;opher. At all times, however, you may rely upon me as your friend.</P>
<P>Lay a&s;ide your ridiculous plan, my Be|linda, or you will make me mi&s;erable. Were I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of half your fortune, and a tythe of your perfections, I &s;hould think my&s;elf entitled to the attentions of the fir&s;t nobility. <HI>Apropos,</HI> have you any of the <HI>beau monde</HI> in your quarter, or do you abound in fox hunters?</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. <HI>BELINDA BLACKET,</HI> to <HI>LOUISA LENOX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PARDON me, Loui&s;a, if I condemn you for the &s;everity of your epi&s;tle. I have unbo&s;omed my whole &s;oul to you; which I never &s;hould have done, had I not been convinced that you entertained the highe&s;t opinion of my integrity and honor. Do you &s;uppo&s;e, my Loui&s;a, educated as I have been in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, (though af|terwards, liberally treated by the &s;ickle God|de&s;s) that I &s;hould &s;o far forget my&s;elf as to hazard my reputation or my honor? No, my dear friend, I wi&s;h only to &s;ee the world; to trace out the &s;nares which are &s;o indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly laid to entrap the unweary &s;ex&punc; and to learn to be upon my guard again&s;t the &s;trat|agems of &s;educers.</P>
<P>Either you have flattered me, or you have always entertained a good opinion of my di&s;|cernment and integrity. You cannot there|fore &s;uppo&s;e that I &s;hould in&s;tantly bid adieu to &s;uch attendants, without giving them a
<PB N="11" REF="035084_0010_1000082A86019518">
proper warning, and engage indi&s;cretion and irregularity in my <HI>&s;uite.</HI> Indeed, Loui&s;a, I am as immaculate as you left me, and am determined to continue unpolluted in thought, word and deed; &s;till, however, I am re&s;olved to have my humour, and to carry my projected plan into immediate ex|ecution. I can, without deviating from the rules of decency, receive the letters of tho&s;e who are candidates for my per&s;on, peru&s;e them, and an&s;wer them as they de&s;erve; &s;hould any of them di&s;play evident marks of being the production of gentlemen, I may probably conde&s;cend to notice them; but if ignorance or vulgarity are the mo&s;t promi|nent features in their epi&s;tles, I &s;hall, with contempt, commit them to the flames.</P>
<P>Should I even deign to permit an interview with any of my unknown corre&s;pondents, it &s;hould be with &s;uch as di&s;played evident <HI>traits</HI> of honor, and a liberal education. A gentleman is as well known by his &s;tile, as by his deportment; and no impo&s;tor can impo&s;e him&s;elf, in that character, on a wo|man of the lea&s;t di&s;cernment. With a gen|tleman, therefore, I have nothing to ri&s;que; with &s;uch a man, preliminaries my be talk|ed of; and, if the treaty &s;hould not happen to be definitive, the negociation is at an end, and no di&s;agreeable con&s;equences can en|&s;ue.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035084_0011_10000831551E5B58">Many vulgar epi&s;tles I &s;hall mo&s;t proba|bly receive, deficient even in orthography and common &s;en&s;e; but, you know, my Loui&s;a, I dete&s;t pretenders of all kinds. I addre&s;s my adverti&s;ement to <HI>gentlemen,</HI> and a per&s;on who a&s;&s;umes that character, e&s;pecially in his writings, is &s;ure of being detected.</P>
<P>To be brief, this adverti&s;ing &s;cheme is a hobbyhor&s;e of mine; and I am &s;ure to gather amu&s;ement from it, whatever may be the other con&s;equences. I expect to re|ceive letters from the <HI>canaille,</HI> as void of decency as of &s;en&s;e, which may afford you and I &s;ome little amu&s;ement, when there is a dearth of more e&s;&s;ential matters. Such epi&s;tles, however, &s;hall not &s;urvive the ob|&s;ervation of the day, but be decently in|terred, and con&s;igned to perpetual oblivion.</P>
<P>I expect, in a &s;hort time, to po&s;&s;e&s;s as many letters as a robber of the mail; but I &s;hould be much &s;urpri&s;ed at finding any bank notes inclo&s;ed in any of them.</P>

<P>YOUR adverti&s;ement in the WORLD, has &s;truck me like electricity; but, perhaps, as I am an apothecary, you may con&s;ider me as a mere <HI>drug,</HI> and fit only for an <HI>opiate</HI> to a lady of your con&s;equence.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is my u&s;ual cu&s;tom to lounge away an hour at a coffeehou&s;e almo&s;t every morning; during which time I meet with a variety of amu&s;ements in the diurnal prints; but nothing has &s;o far excited my attention as your adverti&s;ement, which ap|peared ye&s;terday in the WORLD. There is &s;uch an air of ingenuous can dor in that little compo&s;ition, that I am induced to think the writer of it is in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>Your addre&s;s being general, no apology is nece&s;&s;ary for troubling you with a few lines. As I purpo&s;e to be a candidate for your hand, you will naturally expect that I &s;hould give &s;ome account of my&s;elf, before I can ever hope to be favored with an in|terview. I &s;hall begin therefore, by giving you a faithful portrait of my per&s;on, without exaggeration, either on the &s;ide of flattery or caricature. In point of height, I rather exceed the middle &s;ize. I am neither lean nor cor|pulent; and my figure is erect and &s;trait.
<PB N="16" REF="035084_0015_100008480E503710">
The whole &s;ymmetry of my body will bear inve&s;tigation, except my legs; they are thought to be &s;omewhat out of proportion, nature having been too profu&s;e in furni&s;h|ing tho&s;e regions. My face is of the oval kind, and my no&s;e aquiline; my eyes and eyebrows are truly ebon. It would &s;avour too much of vanity were I to mention the encomiums which have been lavi&s;hed on them. The &s;mall pox has made &s;ome rav|ages upon my countenance, but has not in|jured it; on the contrary, it has &s;tamped a degree of manline&s;s upon it, which it might otherwi&s;e have wanted.</P>
<P>So much for my per&s;on! With re&s;pect to fortune, I have not much to &s;ay; I have a &s;mall unincumbered e&s;tate, which I let for three hundred pounds per annum, and that is all I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. I might, indeed, by following the example of my neighbors, almo&s;t double that income, by rai&s;ing my rents among the tenants; but I am happier at &s;eeing them thrive and flouri&s;h upon my farms, than any augmentation of my rents can po&s;&s;ibly make me.</P>
<P>My father, knowing I had but a &s;canty fortune to &s;ucceed to, bred me to the Bar, to enable me the better to &s;upport the char|acter and appearance of a gentleman. But there were un&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles to my di&s;tingui&s;hing my&s;elf in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall;
<PB N="17" REF="035084_0016_10000852DC1C59A0">
I had too much diffidence, and too much honor in my nature, to make any progre&s;s in the courts of law.</P>
<P>Were I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t &s;hining talents, I never could conde&s;cend to pro&s;ti|tute tho&s;e talents, and plead again&s;t my con|&s;cience for a fee. If I unju&s;tly detain the property of the fatherle&s;s or the widow, and give a lawyer a large fee, his mercenary tongue will move for hours, to varni&s;h my &s;ullied character, or to conceal my villainy; without regarding the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e whom his abilities have robbed of bread.</P>
<P>Not being able therefore to add to my fortune, by exerci&s;ing my profe&s;&s;ion; my income would be inadequate to my ex|pen&s;es, were I not to ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t fru|gality upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Permit me then, Madam, to approach you, and &s;olicit your fair hand; I feel a kind of <HI>pre&s;entiment</HI> that nature has formed us for each other. My little fortune, added to what you po&s;&s;e&s;s, will afford independen|cy to both. If you will deign to honor me with an audience, I flatter my&s;elf that I &s;hall be able to plead my own cau&s;e entirely to your &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Should I be &s;o unfortunate as to be thought unworthy of an an&s;wer to this epi&s;tle, I know not what might be the con|&s;equence. Pi&s;tols and daggers are alarming

<P>ACCUSE me not of pre&s;umption, Madam, for venturing to trouble you with a few ob&s;ervations on your conduct, re&s;pect|ing your addre&s;s to the Public, on &s;o inter|e&s;ting and important a &s;ubject as matrimo|ny. I cannot think you are in earne&s;t; for a young lady with your figure, fortune, and accompli&s;hments, mu&s;t demand the admira|tion and reverence of mankind.</P>
<P>But, whether you are in je&s;t or earne&s;t, let me entreat you, my dear girl, to be &s;trict|ly upon your guard. Be not entrapped by the &s;educive wiles of the abandoned liber|tine,

<P>Struck by the con&s;ideration of your age and inexperience, I con&s;idered it as my duty to remon&s;trate with you on &s;o alarming a procedure. You will the more readily ex|cu&s;e me, my dear Madam, when I inform you that I am a clergyman; and in that character, con&s;cienciou&s;ly performing what I could not di&s;pen&s;e with, without commit|ting a violence on my feelings. If in this particular, you think I am overacting my part, I ki&s;s the rod of correction, and reque&s;t your pardon; if, on the contrary, you &s;hould commend my vigilance for your &s;afe|ty, I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf happy.</P>
<P>My humble &s;ituation in life precludes me from making you a tender of my hand, or I would immediately have addre&s;&s;ed you as a lover; in order to &s;natch you from the danger which apparently awaits you. I am but a poor curate, and may probably long continue &s;o, having but little intere&s;t with tho&s;e in power; and exaltation in the Church depends wholly upon a man's con|nexions.</P>
<P>I pretend not to &s;uperior talents, or to a more exemplary life, than many of my cloth; but, admitting that my abilities and conduct were in the highe&s;t degree meritori|ous,

<P>Should you, however, conde&s;cend to take compa&s;&s;ion on me, and, by honoring me with your hand, lift me from poverty to happine&s;s and independence, how much would you be entitled to my gratitude; and how zealou&s;ly &s;hould I endeavor to de&s;erve a favor &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;o unexpect|ed! But I condemn my arrogance and &s;elf delu&s;ion, having as great preten&s;ions to a mitre, as to &s;uch unparalleled genero&s;ity from Belinda.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Madam, even for &s;ugge&s;ting &s;o extravagant an idea.

<P>But how am I deviating from the path I entered upon!

<P>Hitherto I have not any rea&s;on to regret the adoption of my &s;cheme. It affords me amu&s;ement, keeps me from <HI>ennui,</HI> and in|&s;tructs me, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, in the knowl|edge of the world.</P>
<P>As I expected, I received epi&s;tles of various kinds; &s;erious and humorous; whim&s;ical and &s;olemn; &s;arca&s;tical and ludi|crous. An apothecary recommends him&s;elf to me as a drug; a lawyer very obligingly offers to partake of my fortune, becau&s;e he he has too much hone&s;ty and honor to &s;upport or defend an act of villainy; and a very &s;ententious clergyman advi&s;es me to be
<PB N="36" REF="035084_0035_100008A842A742A0">
extremely cautious and circum&s;pect, in a matter of &s;uch great importance.</P>
<P>Among the ludicrous letters that have yet come to hand, may be reckoned that of a blundering Hibernian, who declares him&s;elf to be a gentleman of large expectations, but choo&s;es to amu&s;e him&s;elf with carrying a &s;edan chair!</P>
<P>Another is from an impertinent puppy, who de&s;ires me to return to boarding &s;chool. This is the mo&s;t in&s;olent epi&s;tle that I have received. It is evidently the production of &s;ome empty coxcomb.</P>
<P>A wealthy butcher, in the true Smithfield &s;tyle, &s;olicits my hand, either for him&s;elf or &s;on, and gives a very curious and entertain|ing account of him&s;elf; and a Mr. Salmon de&s;ires to be <HI>&s;erved up</HI> to me, not con&s;idering that Lent is ju&s;t expired.</P>
<P>A fre&s;h packet of letters has this moment arrived, which would take &s;ome hours in the peru&s;al; but they &s;hall remain unno|ticed by me, till I have di&s;charged my duty to my Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>Had I &s;ufficient lei&s;ure, I would copy the letters as I receive them, and tran&s;mit tho&s;e copies to you; but I am &s;ufficiently em|ployed in reading them only. You mu&s;t therefore wait with patience till you return to London, when you will certainly have a
<PB N="37" REF="035084_0036_100008B26D69E678">
delecious treat in looking over tho&s;e which I &s;hall recommend to your peru&s;al.</P>
<P>I am really of opinion, my Loui&s;a, that, among my epi&s;tolary wooers, I &s;hall be able to make a prudent and judicious choice. One or two, who have already favored me with addre&s;&s;es, &s;eem perfectly qualified to render any rea&s;onable woman happy, if mental qualifications are e&s;&s;ential to that end. My fortune is more than &s;ufficient for the &s;phere of life in which I intend to move; then why &s;hould I require an addi|tion to that fortune, or &s;eek for an equiva|lent in an hu&s;band?</P>
<P>A match, upon &s;uch a con&s;truction, could be but barter for barter; where, like two plodding partners, each may be con&s;idered as having brought in his full proportion of the articles in trade, and that neither of them are indebted to each other.</P>
<P>My di&s;po&s;ition is of a different, and I flat|ter my&s;elf of a nobler turn. It is a glori|ous &s;atisfaction to me, to confer favors, with|out even the de&s;ire or expectation of a re|turn! I &s;hould be happy in be&s;towing the means of happine&s;s on a man whom I e&s;teemed, and in receiving tho&s;e returns of affection which the grateful are ever ready to pay. But, where mercenary marriages are negociated, and &s;hilling for &s;hilling is the &s;tipulation on both &s;ides, the equality of
<PB N="38" REF="035084_0037_0FFFB5241ACDA608">
the parties is principally contended for, and a man treats his wife with common decency and re&s;pect, from no other motive than be|cau&s;e &s;he advanced her &s;hare of the capital &s;tock.</P>
<P>Such people, my Loui&s;a, are de&s;titute of &s;entiment and feeling. There is a plea&s;ure in conferring and receiving favors; but where there are cautious &s;tipulations and every act is performed for a valuable con|&s;ideration, a generous heart &s;hudders at the idea.</P>
<P>I hope you are, by this time a little bet|ter reconciled to my project. As I have found time, notwith&s;tanding I am &s;o much engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, to write you this long epi&s;tle, I expect one of the fir&s;t magnitude from you. Favor me with a de&s;cription of the country round you, and with &s;ome account of your neighbors. Tell me if there are any pretty fellows within a rea&s;onable di&s;|tance of your man&s;ion; but, above all, be particular in informing me when I may ex|pect the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you in the me|tropolis.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. <HI>MR. LUCKLESS,</HI> to <HI>BELINLA.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF your heart is capable of feeling for the unfortunate, I may flatter my&s;elf that you will take compa&s;&s;ion on me; or at lea&s;t, that you will conde&s;cend to pay &s;ome atten|tion to my di&s;a&s;trous tale.</P>
<P>In my early youth, indeed, nothing mate|rial happened to me of a calamitous nature, except the lo&s;s of an indulgent father and mother; but ever &s;ince I approached man|hood, a &s;eries of misfortunes have attended me.</P>
<P>At the age of twenty, I &s;ucceeded to an e&s;tate of fifteen hundred pounds per annum, and upwards of thirty thou&s;and pounds in ca&s;h; &s;o affluent a fortune I thought would enable me to adopt a genteel mode of living, without injuring my circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Having only an antiquated man&s;ion hou&s;e upon my premi&s;es, I ordered a new
<PB N="40" REF="035084_0039_0FFFB526C7A974D0">
one to be erected in the modern &s;tyle, on which I expended &s;even thou&s;and pounds, and about a fourth part of that &s;um in the mo&s;t elegant furniture I could procure; but, before I was in the actual occupation of it, the whole building took fire, and that and the furniture were all con&s;umed to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Prior to this accident, I had depo&s;ited up|wards of ten thou&s;and pounds in the hands of a merchant, whom I con&s;idered as my banker, and meant to draw on him for ca&s;h as I might occa&s;ionally want it. He was a director of the Bank, a member of parlia|ment, and a governor of many of the city ho&s;pitals. He was &s;aid to be immen&s;ely rich by all who knew him, and I thought my property as &s;ecure as if it had been in the funds; when, gue&s;s at my &s;urprize, Madam, the very next day after the flames had lev|elled my new man&s;ion with the ground, I read my merchant's name in the Gazette, introduced with a <HI>whereas</HI>; and I have &s;ince received a dividend of only two &s;hillings in the pound.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have had an equivalent for all the&s;e lo&s;&s;es, by a twenty thou&s;and pound prize, had I not fooli&s;hly parted with my ticket to a neighbor. I had purcha&s;ed it for my&s;elf with a determination to &s;tand the chance of it; but, being then in London, I received a letter from a gentleman in the
<PB N="41" REF="035084_0040_100008BD0B20D0E0">
country, reque&s;ting me to purcha&s;e him a lottery ticket. Unwilling to quit the com|pany I was then engaged in, to repair to a lottery office, I &s;ent my own ticket to my friend, thinking I could buy another at my convenience; and <HI>that</HI> ticket was afterwards drawn a prize of twenty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Certainly I was born under the influence of &s;ome unlucky planet; for, not long after this very provoking accident, fortune, in one of her freaks, deprived me of a con&s;iderable legacy. A di&s;tant relation of mine, think|ing his death approaching, gave in&s;tructions to an attorney to prepare a will, wherein he had bequeathed me five thou&s;and guineas; the will was engro&s;&s;ed, read and approved; but, ju&s;t as he was about to &s;ign and execute it, he called for a gla&s;s of cold water, and drank it; which immediately threw him into convul&s;ions, and he dropped down dead. By his thus dying inte&s;tate, I lo&s;t the five thou&s;and guineas, that were intend|ed for me, and the heir at law (who would have been cut off with a &s;hilling, had the will been executed) &s;ucceeded to a very large real e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Chagrined at &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;ap|pointments, and my ready ca&s;h being all exhau&s;ted, I applied to an adverti&s;ing mo|ney lender for a pre&s;ent &s;upply; who readi|ly undertook to di&s;count my own notes for
<PB N="42" REF="035084_0041_0FFFB52D351FE250">
any &s;um I might require, at the moderate and legal intere&s;t of five per <HI>cent.</HI> He ob|&s;erved, however, that it was u&s;ual, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, for the borrower to allow a &s;mall premium to him, as agent between the bor|rower and the lender. To enforce the proprie|ty of his receiving &s;ome little reward, he add|ed, that he mu&s;t guarantee &s;uch notes, by en|dor&s;ing them him&s;elf, which rendered him liable to pay the whole &s;ums, provided I did not honor them regularly as they became due; politely ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, that he did not imagine he ran the lea&s;t ri&s;que with a gentleman of my &s;eeming probity.</P>
<P>There appeared to be &s;omething &s;o plau&s;i|ble and proper in the man's conduct, in this bu&s;ine&s;s, that I &s;ubmitted to his terms, and drew three promi&s;&s;ory notes for five hundred pounds each, at two, four, and &s;ix months after date, and pre&s;ented them to him, rely|ing upon his prote&s;tations that he would furni&s;h me with ca&s;h for them at the hour of two the next day. I waited impatiently for the arrival of that hour; but my plau&s;i|ble Jew never made his appearance; and I never heard of the &s;ecurities I had given him to negociate, till after the expiration of two months, when I was arre&s;ted for five hun|dred pounds, the amount of the fir&s;t note that became due.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="035084_0042_100008C443B52478">I remon&s;trated with the &s;heriff's officer on the cruelty and inju&s;tice of the tran&s;action; who unfeelingly replied, that it was of no con&s;equence to him, nor did he wi&s;h to be informed of any of the particulars; he had got a warrant to arre&s;t me, and that was &s;uf|ficient for him. Without further ceremony, he conducted me to a &s;punging hou&s;e, where I was confined till I found means to procure the money to pay the note, and co&s;ts of &s;uit.</P>
<P>As the two other notes &s;ucce&s;&s;ively became due, I was treated in the &s;ame inhuman manner, and actually paid the whole fifteen hundred pounds, though I had not received a &s;ingle &s;hilling upon any of the &s;ecurities.</P>
<P>I con&s;ulted lawyers, whether it was po&s;&s;ible by any means to evade the payment of them, as it was evident they had been &s;windled from me; but, as they had pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal hands, and had been endor&s;ed from one to another for a pretended valuable con|&s;ideration, they advi&s;ed me to &s;ubmit to my pre&s;ent lo&s;s, rather than engage in expen&s;ive &s;uits, which would probably terminate again&s;t me.</P>
<P>In order to rai&s;e money to get rid of this infamous bu&s;ine&s;s, I was compelled to mort|gage my e&s;tate, upon which I borrowed ten thou&s;and pounds. The remainder of that &s;um is now almo&s;t con&s;umed.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="035084_0043_100008C963CA3370">The&s;e, Madam, are a few of the misfor|tunes which I have experienced; but you may be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall be extremely wary for the future.</P>
<P>If you, Madam, will conde&s;cend to no|tice me, I think I &s;hould receive an ample recompen&s;e for all the untoward events that have befallen me. My fortune is &s;till con&s;id|erable, and probably yours may be &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the incumbrance on my e&s;tate.

<P>P.S. Having hitherto been &s;o remarkably unfortunate in all my undertakings, I ex|pect a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es to balance the ac|count between the blinded Godde&s;s and my&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. <HI>MR. STANZA,</HI> to <HI>BELINDA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOUR adverti&s;ement, Madam, ex|cited my curio&s;ity, and I have pre&s;umed to become your corre&s;pondent. I cannot, however, boa&s;t of any large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions or expectancies, my e&s;tate being all <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word; for I have only my per&s;on that I can call my own. I am ready to &s;ettle that on you, Madam, at any time; but, as I cannot &s;ay much in commendation of it, I am almo&s;t afraid to recommend it to you.</P>
<P>Having no income but the produce of my brain, I may literally be &s;aid to live upon my wit. Con&s;equently my table is but in|differently &s;pread. Turtle and capon I know not even the ta&s;te of; and in&s;tead of a &s;irloin &s;moking on my board, a mutton chop, un|accompanied with pickles or other provoca|tives, frequently con&s;titutes my whole bill of fare.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="035084_0045_100008CD84F8CFD8">When I attend my duty in the hou&s;e of commons&mdash;mi&s;take me not, Madam, for I am not a member of that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, but only act in the character of a reporter&mdash; every &s;peech delivered by any of the &s;enators of that hou&s;e, I commit to memory, and &s;erve it up to the public the next morning. Probably, Madam, you may take in the <HI>World</HI>&mdash;That paper is devoted to my pro|ductions&mdash;The Speeches in Parliament, Memoirs of &s;chool boys, the fabrication alluding to <HI>crim. con.</HI> and all the ca&s;ualties in that performance, are entirely my own compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Indeed I am thought capital at a ca&s;ualty, few of my profe&s;&s;ion pre&s;uming to attempt to vie with me in that department. No longer ago than ye&s;terday, I over&s;et a boat under London bridge, by which accident two gen|tlemen and three ladies were drowned; and to render the &s;hock as great as po&s;&s;ible to the reader, I made one of the ladies in the la&s;t month of her pregnancy.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day I &s;tole an infant, the only i&s;&s;ue of a rich and reputable family, from the arms of the nur&s;ery maid, put out its eyes, and &s;old it to a beggar woman in Whitechapel.</P>
<P>During the drawing of the la&s;t lottery, I killed as many <HI>pigeons,</HI> by throwing them
<PB N="47" REF="035084_0046_100008D226F03748">
from their hor&s;es, as would furni&s;h half a dozen dove hou&s;es.</P>
<P>I am thought to be particularly excellent in a murder. A murder of my committing is immediately known by an intelligent reader, becau&s;e it is always attended with &s;uch peculiar circum&s;tances of horror. I am allowed a &s;hilling each for all my mur|ders, whil&s;t others are glad to furni&s;h tho&s;e articles at only half the price.</P>
<P>Sometimes, when adverti&s;ements run &s;hort in our paper, I am ordered by the conductor, to make about half a column of &s;candal, which is one of the ea&s;ie&s;t ta&s;ks in the whole province of literature. I acknowledge, in|deed, that I feel &s;ome little remor&s;e in fab|ricating articles of that nature. Were it not in the way of bu&s;ine&s;s, it would be a &s;pecies of cruelty to rob a lady of her repu|tation, and load the hu&s;band's forehead with a pair of imaginary horns, for &s;o trifling a con&s;ideration as I u&s;ually receive. I have occa&s;ioned at lea&s;t half a dozen &s;eparations between hu&s;band and wife, by in&s;inuations and oblique charges, when the lady has been as cha&s;te and innocent as Diana.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, Madam, that my abilities are limited to the productions of a diurnal paper. I &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ociate with the Mu&s;es, and pick up a penny in the poetic line. When I have got a few &s;hiners in my pocket,
<PB N="48" REF="035084_0047_100008D4EB684630">
I attempt heroics, and often with &s;ucce&s;s. As my ca&s;h dimini&s;hes, my genius dimin|i&s;hes of cour&s;e, and then I can only pro|duce &s;onnets and other inferior lyric compo|&s;itions. If my la&s;t guinea &s;uffers tran&s;|mutation, the wings of my imagination are &s;o clo&s;ely clipped, that I am then fit only for elegy.</P>
<P>Once in my life time, I attempted to write a tragedy, but the managers of the royal theatres thought proper to reject it; &s;agaciou&s;|ly ob&s;erving, that it was too deep and affect|ing. Was there ever &s;o ridiculous a rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for not performing a dramatic piece, of &s;ingular excellence? Can any thing be more ab&s;urd than to condemn a tragedy for being tragic?</P>
<P>My tragedy was called, "<HI>The Incendiary; or,</HI> 1780." The <HI>plot</HI> had &s;ome gunpowder in it and a large quantity of hemp. When I came to the <HI>denouement</HI> in the la&s;t act, one of the mo&s;t awful &s;cenes are repre&s;ented, that I believe has ever appeared on any &s;tage. No le&s;s than three gallow&s;es are ex|hibited at one view, and &s;ixteen malefactors! pendant from each gallows. Was there ever a more noble &s;pectacle! and how con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;olemnity, &s;ublimity and dignity of the tragic Mu&s;e?</P>
<P>I fear, Madam, you will think me too prolix; but, when I profe&s;s my&s;elf a &s;uitor
<PB N="49" REF="035084_0048_100008D793B6EBB8">
to a lady, it is nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould ac|quaint her with the rea&s;ons on which I build my preten&s;ions to her hand. I wi&s;h, Madam, to become your hu&s;band; but I &s;hould not expect that you would honor me with an an&s;wer to this epi&s;tle, had I not pointed out a <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> method of getting bread for my&s;elf and partner.</P>
<P>With your pecuniary aid, I would engage to e&s;tabli&s;h a new morning print upon the mo&s;t permanent footing. Should &s;uch a journal appear, as I am capable of pro|ducing, the publications of the day mu&s;t hide their dimini&s;hed heads. The <HI>World</HI> would then be at an <HI>end;</HI> the <HI>Po&s;t</HI> would be <HI>de&s;erted;</HI> the <HI>Public</HI> Adverti&s;er confined to a few <HI>private</HI> hands; and the <HI>Herald</HI> be|come a <HI>Pur&s;uivant.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;ome thoughts of taking away one of the gallow&s;es from the cata&s;trophe of my tragedy, and pre&s;ent it a &s;econd time to the managers, but I will not give up the other two, to plea&s;e all the critics in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I mu&s;t beg you to give me an audience; when I will produce &s;uch credentials as, I flatter my&s;elf, will convince you that I am not wholly unworthy of your attention.</P>

<P>I am too much of the ru&s;tic, Madam, to be guilty of a compliment. Men of poli&s;hed man|ners only can manage tho&s;e weapons with dexterity.

<P>I freely acknowledge to you, Belinda, that he is far from being indifferent to me; and though I affected to wi&s;h him gone, by talk|ing of the latene&s;s of the hour, and bidding him good night, I was as de&s;irous of his &s;taying as he could po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>

<P>Appearances, however, mu&s;t be pre&s;erved for a time, and I mu&s;t affect re&s;erve and in|difference to avoid the imputation of for|wardne&s;s.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING a gentleman and a baronet, I take the liberty to become your corre&s;pon|dent. I once had a tolerable good e&s;tate, but now have only a &s;canty annuity, barely &s;ufficient to keep my&s;elf above want, and my apparel from being ragged.</P>
<P>But my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, thank heaven, &s;hall nev|er attempt me to act di&s;honorably by fal&s;e repre&s;entations. I have a title to be&s;tow,
<PB N="61" REF="035084_0060_0FFFB5344065B328">
Madam, and a title only. If that &s;hould merit your attention, you may command my attendance at a moment's warning; but, if you &s;hould not deem that title equiva|lent to your fortune, our treaty is at an end.</P>
<P>Permit me, however, to ob&s;erve, that I am not deficient in per&s;onal or mental qual|ifications, and my age does not exceed twen|ty &s;ix. You need not be precipitate in giv|ing me an an&s;wer.

You know, Madam, the re&s;pect due, and general|ty paid to a title, by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of mankind, and how re&s;pectable the title of <HI>my Lady</HI> is con&s;idered in all companies, and upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>You have a fortune without a title, and I am in the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a title with|out a fortune. By a union we &s;hould both have titles, and an ample independence; both of us would be gifted with preemi|nence and fortune.</P>
<P>Nor do I con&s;ider it as de&s;cending from my rank, when I deign to make propo&s;als to a lady of your &s;eeming abilities and pen|etration.</P>
<P>I have further to ob&s;erve, for your &s;erious con&s;ideration, the probability of the advan|tage which your po&s;terity may hereafter en|joy, e&s;pecially the male heirs, lineally de|&s;cended,

<P>EXCUSE an undertaker, who, for a moment neglects his decea&s;ed friends, to lay him&s;elf at the feet of a mo&s;t amiable young lady. I have a flouri&s;hing run of bu&s;ine&s;s, which will fully enable me to &s;upport a lady

in an elegant &s;tyle. On the very day that you adverti&s;ement caught my eye, my wife took a final leave of this &s;ublunary world, and has left me a widower. She was a good wife and merits decent interment. A hear&s;e and &s;ix, decorated with plumes&punc; and attend|ed by three mourning coaches, &s;hall conduct her to her la&s;t home.</P>
<P>How opportunely has &s;he quitted the theatre of life, when &s;o fine an opening pre|&s;ents it&s;elf to furni&s;h me with another!</P>
<P>Luckily for me, Madam, we have had a very unhealthy &s;ea&s;on, and I have driven a roaring trade for the&s;e &s;everal months pa&s;t. I have buried many of my be&s;t friends, and, if the reigning fever &s;hould continue its ravages, I am not without hopes of attending the ob&s;equies of as many more. A young phy&s;ician in my neighborhood has con|tributed not a little, to accelerate their de|parture. That he may live long and pro&s;|per is the foremo&s;t of my wi&s;hes!</P>
<P>There are many advantages, Madam, pe|culiar to my profe&s;&s;ion. Elm of an inferior price, as effectually &s;erves for a wooden man&s;ion, as that of the fir&s;t quality, and the inhabitant never can complain of the architecture. Heirs at law, executors, and legatees, always pay the undertaker's bill, without taxation or grumbling, e&s;pecially if the decea&s;ed cuts up pretty hand&s;omely;
<PB N="64" REF="035084_0063_10000906DBC7D8D0">
and, if he leaves the world as he found it, &s;ome pious relative generally undertakes to perform the la&s;t &s;ervice liberally.</P>
<P>Really, Madam, I am in a mo&s;t excellent line of bu&s;ine&s;s, and have had the plea&s;ure and happine&s;s of burying &s;ome of the fir&s;t nobility. I lately was employed to conduct the funeral of one of the mo&s;t benevolent gentlemen that ever exi&s;ted; his lo&s;s was univer&s;ally lamented, except by me and his legatees. Had I not been his undertaker, I would have &s;incerely wi&s;hed him a longer life!</P>
<P>Probably you may have a friend at Court, who may have intere&s;t to procure me the management of a royal funeral. What a flattering pro&s;pect for a man in my line of bu&s;ine&s;s! for, as the family are numerous, the common cour&s;e of mortality will fre|quently create a job for me. Far be it from my thoughts that &s;uch melancholy events will give me plea&s;ure, but when a per&s;on's time is come&punc; Madam, I may as well bury him as any other undertaker.</P>
<P>Should I be &s;o unfortunate as to &s;urvive you, Madam, you &s;hall be interred with all the pomp and trappings of my profe&s;&s;ion. Mutes &s;hall be po&s;ted at my door, e&s;cutche|ones and plumes &s;hall decorate your hear&s;e; and your funeral &s;ermon &s;hall be preached by a doctor in divinity.</P>

the mo&s;t effectual methods of combating the di&s;ea&s;es incident to that noble animal.</P>

This continual <HI>&s;ound</HI> of bu&s;ine&s;s, together with a fine chemical and galenical exhibition at the window, &s;oon produced &s;ome real patients.</P>

world; but I have the con&s;olation to think that I exerted my be&s;t endeavors, and the be&s;t phy&s;ician could have done no more. The mo&s;t eminent of the faculty are often obliged to work in the dark, and con&s;equent|ly whether they kill or cure, mu&s;t depend merely upon accident.</P>
<P>Becoming a little e&s;tabli&s;hed in bu&s;ine&s;s, I conceived an idea of inventing a few no&s;|trums. Being, as I before ob&s;erved, a regu|lar practitioner, I could not bear to behold a parcel of empiries lolling in their coaches; many of whom had been &s;hoemakers, black|&s;miths, or the mo&s;t menial mechanics; I therefore u&s;hered into the world, with the greate&s;t di&s;patch imaginable, a <HI>Cephalalgi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> or powder for the headach&punc; and a plai&s;ter for the de&s;truction of corns. Thus, by laying a tax upon the two extremes of mankind, the head and the feet, I pre&s;ently found my&s;elf in a &s;ituation to enable me to imitate the other no&s;trum mongers, and &s;et up a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> elegant carriage.</P>
<P>Encouraged by a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;sful events, I came to the re&s;olution of purcha&s;ing a diploma, and be con&s;tituted in reality a doc|tor in medicine. I applied to the univer&s;i|ty of A&mdash;, and for the moderate &s;um of fourteen guineas, purcha&s;ed as complete a diploma for that purpo&s;e, as could be obtain|ed
<PB N="71" REF="035084_0070_1000091BAFF5BD90">
at Oxford or Cambridge, by eleven years academical re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch excellent materials for puffing, I got my diploma tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, printed the &s;ub&s;tance of it on the papers which inclo&s;ed my no&s;trums, and took &s;uch other &s;teps to acquaint the world with my real dignity, that I am now con&s;id|ered as one of the fir&s;t phy&s;icians in the metropolis.</P>
<P>I have projected &s;ome other general medi|cines, which will, in a &s;hort time, be re|&s;pectfully pre&s;ented to the public. Particu|larly, a lotion to promote dentition; an <HI>otalgiac</HI> powder for the cure of the <HI>earach</HI>; and a bal&s;amic tincture for the <HI>heartach;</HI> the la&s;t of which I fear I mu&s;t have recour&s;e to my|&s;elf, unle&s;s you conde&s;cend to notice this epi&s;tle, and expre&s;s a willingne&s;s to partake of my good fortune.</P>
<P>I have forgot to ob&s;erve to you, Madam, that I once had a &s;pecific for the gout, which is the only article of mine that has not been attended with &s;ucce&s;s. It happened unlucki|ly that, during the time of my adverti&s;ing that medicine, I was laid up with a &s;evere arthritic fit. This got wind, and my &s;peci|fic became a mere drug; the public very judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erving, that, had I actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an infallible remedy for &s;uch an

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. <HI>BELINDA BLACKET,</HI> to <HI>LOUISA LENOX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I CONGRATULATE you, my Loui+&s;a, on your new acqui&s;ition; and I con|gratulate the inhabitants in your vicinity&punc; on their having a man among them &s;o capa|ble of di&s;cerning merit, and &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of the tender pa&s;&s;ion under its proper influ|ence.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed at the encomiums you have be&s;towed on your ingenuous &s;wain; but the
<PB N="73" REF="035084_0072_0FFFB54039ECDF68">
choice he has made is a &s;ufficient eulogium on him; a volume of panegyric cannot &s;o effectually di&s;play his ta&s;te, his under&s;tand|ing, and his di&s;cernment, as his taking the earlie&s;t opportunity of tendering his hand and heart to my Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>The <HI>naivete</HI> and &s;implicity of his manner, on a fir&s;t interview, are highly characteri&s;tic of his &s;en&s;ibility. Who could approach &s;o much excellence, for the fir&s;t time, without the greate&s;t agitation and perturbation of mind?&mdash;None but the ignorant and the in|different. But, according to your own re|lation, how rapid were his advances from timidity to a proper degree of confidence, and from confidence to courage. He is indeed a jewel, and requires but little poli&s;hing.</P>
<P>I am not di&s;plea&s;ed, Loui&s;a, that you ac|knowledge Mr. Graham po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a little cor|ner of your heart. You admit that he is not indifferent to you; and that you "expect," and even "<HI>hope,</HI>" that his &s;econd vi&s;it will not be long delayed.</P>
<P>Ah! my deare&s;t girl, you mu&s;t now be numbered among the wounded.&mdash;You mu&s;t no longer declare your&s;elf impregnable. Happy am I to find, however, that he who inflicted the wound, can admini&s;ter a cure; from him proceed the poi&s;on and the antidote.</P>
<P>I am entirely of your opinion, Loui&s;a, that appearances are to be pre&s;erved; for the malignant tongue of &s;lander is ever voluble,
<PB N="74" REF="035084_0073_1000092973CA9738">
and where any action will admit of two con|&s;tructions, the wor&s;t is &s;ure to be adopted.</P>
<P>You doubtle&s;s expect a catalogue of tho&s;e lovers, who have made me a tender of their &s;ervices &s;ince my la&s;t. They would make collectively, a mo&s;t excellent groupe, and furni&s;h great &s;cope for the genius of a Bunbu|ry. The fir&s;t upon the li&s;t is the mo&s;t ill fated mortal that ever has exi&s;ted &s;ince the days of Adam, and pleads his misfortunes as a kind of claim to my compa&s;&s;ion; not con|&s;idering what the poet has advanced&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>" Look into tho&s;e they call unfortunate,</L>
<L>" And clo&s;er view'd you'll find they are unwi&s;e,</L>
<L>" Some flaw in their own conduct lies beneath."</L></Q>
<P>But, with all becoming deference to Dr. Young, this ob&s;ervation is more poetical than ju&s;t. It comes, however, with propriety from the lips of an avaricious father, who recommends a fortunate lover to his daugh|ter, and pointedly exclaims again&s;t a &s;uitor whom &s;he approves, merely on account of his misfortunes; though, in other re&s;pects, the former is much inferior to the latter.</P>
<P>My next corre&s;pondent is really a plea&s;|ant fellow. His letter extorted &s;everal hearty laughs from me in the peru&s;al of it. He a&s;|&s;umes the name of <HI>Stanza</HI> and mentions &s;everal literary productions in which he is an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. He ridicules, in a fine vein of
<PB N="75" REF="035084_0074_1000092AF9E93200">
humor, the contrivances of the editors of new&s;papers, to amu&s;e and entertain their readers. His &s;atire on particular <HI>manoeuvres</HI> is equally ju&s;t and entertaining, and his pro|jected plan of a new paper, is mentioned with great plea&s;antry.</P>
<P>A Quaker is the next upon the li&s;t, who, after abu&s;ing me in the affected &s;tyle of that ridiculous tribe, clum&s;ily offers to embelli&s;h his beaver with a button, rather than not be admitted one of the candidates for my per|&s;on.</P>
<P>A Baronet, pre&s;uming on his title, attacks me with &s;ome effrontery; but I &s;hall treat him with the negligence he merits.</P>
<P>An Undertaker next addre&s;&s;es me, who, from his own di&s;cription of him&s;elf, is cer|tainly an original character. I may, perhaps, conde&s;cend to an&s;wer his letter, and appoint an interview; but it will be only to afford amu&s;ement for the hour.</P>
<P>A Quack Doctor is, to me, a mo&s;t dete&s;t|able character; and the epi&s;tle which I have received from one of that de&s;cription, con|firms me in the opinion I have always enter|tained of that baneful fraternity. He has meanly purcha&s;ed of the mercenary college of A&mdash;, a doctor's diploma, the better to enable him to proceed upon his medical farce, and impo&s;e upon mankind. It was well &s;aid by a certain wag, &s;peaking of that

univer&s;ity, that though it was poor now, it would get rich by <HI>degrees.</HI></P>
<P>I have this day received a vi&s;it from one of my epi&s;tolary candidates, in con&s;equence of a permi&s;&s;ion under my &s;ign manual. It was my clerical &s;uitor, Mr. Proby; and real|ly he appears to be in all re&s;pects, a gentle|man.

<P>My be&s;t thanks are due to you, Madam, for &s;uch unparalleled genero&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<P>Such, my Loui&s;a, was the conver&s;ation between me and my young &s;prig of divinity; when, after a few compliments of cour&s;e, he bowed and took his leave.</P>
<P>He is really a very hand&s;ome fellow; and, had he not quite &s;o much gravity and formality, would &s;tand very forward in my e&s;teem. But, like your timid lover, I ex|pect him to improve, and &s;hould not won|der at finding him a perfect rattle after he has received two or three audiences.</P>
<P>Should he happen to be the man of my choice, promotion in the church may be ob|tained for him upon very moderate terms. Other genteel and lucrative employments,
<PB N="80" REF="035084_0079_0FFFB547E6B27A98">
are purcha&s;ed at a more extravagant rate, becau&s;e they are &s;uitable to every man; but eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments can be enjoyed on|ly by eccle&s;ia&s;tics.</P>
<P>His having no fortune is not di&s;plea&s;ing to me, as I have &s;ufficient of my own. Be|&s;ides, my uncle is the patron of a living of five hundred a year, and the pre&s;ent incum|bent is upwards of eighty. This is no very di&s;tant pro&s;pect; and I know I can procure it for him without any difficulty.</P>
<P>You reque&s;ted a long epi&s;tle from me, and &s;o far you certainly are gratified; but whether it will contribute to your amu&s;e|ment or information, is a matter which ex|erci&s;es my hopes and fears.</P>
<P>A new comedy has ju&s;t appeared at Co|vent Garden theatre. A Baronet's lady <HI>confe&s;&s;es</HI> her&s;elf the author of it; but &s;he has not acquired that reputation from it which &s;he expected. It abounds with indelicate allu&s;ions, and <HI>double entendres</HI> bordering on ob&s;cenity.

<P>I THANK you, my Belinda, for the three days which you have cut off between me and happine&s;s. As you predicted I gave the hint, and the worthy youth improv|ed it.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="035084_0099_10000826CAD262C0">I trembled for you, when I peru&s;ed the dialogue between you and MacGregor, and could perceive, from your cautious and guarded an&s;wers to his in&s;olence and ab&s;urd|ity, that you were much terrified. From your de&s;cription of the fellow in a former letter, I thought him ab&s;urd and inoffen&s;ive; but it appears, upon trial, that he is a &s;trange mixture of malignity and whim. His &s;ar|ca&s;ms terrify me, but his ab&s;urd oddities divert me. Never &s;uffer him to approach you more.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be expeditious, or I &s;hall &s;et you an example, in&s;tead of waiting to be a follower. My aunt with whom I have now taken up my re&s;idence, and who is my near|e&s;t relation now living, highly approves and encourages the propo&s;ed match, well know|ing that &s;uch an alliance would be, in all re&s;pects, honorable and advantageous to our family.</P>
<P>Mr. Graham has no idea of my having any fortune; but I mean to &s;urpri&s;e him, by pre&s;enting it to him on the day that our nuptials are celebrated. I think I need not now inform you how much it is, having, I well remember, already mentioned the &s;um to you. In&s;tead of three thou&s;and pounds, would it were fifty.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf that Mr. Graham will not have made an improper or di&s;advantageous

match, when all expectancies are taken into con&s;ideration. My aunt's fortune is very con&s;iderable, and I am her next heir; but, what is &s;till of greater con&s;equence, I am her only favorite.</P>
<P>How &s;olid, &s;erious and thoughtful am I grown, &s;ince I have formed a re&s;olution of altering my condition. Upon all manner of &s;ubjects. I debate with as much formality and &s;eeming &s;agacity as my aunt, and de|liberate on the con&s;equences that may prob|ably en&s;ue in certain &s;ituations.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I am cea&s;ing to be girli&s;h, and am willing to put on the woman, in every acceptation of the word. Be not &s;urpri&s;ed, therefore my Belinda, at the gravity of my future epi&s;tles.</P>

<P>Amiable girl! On how firm a ba&s;is have you e&s;tabli&s;hed my hopes! I flattered my|&s;elf&punc; even before this kind, this candid dec|laration, that I was not wholly indifferent to you; but I can now look forward, with a degree of certainty, to the moment which will cement our hearts and fortunes. Suf|fer me, my dear Loui&s;a, to propo&s;e an alter|ation re&s;pecting our lunar agreement. In|&s;tead of giving me a definitive an&s;wer on that day, as therein covenanted, give me the definitive an&s;wer now, and let that day

each other, and that we actually are (cere|mony excepted) cemented by the mo&s;t ex|alted tie, the union of hearts. I &s;hall make immediate application to &s;ome gentlemen of the bar, to prepare a proper &s;ettlement for my Loui&s;a, in which blanks &s;hall be left open to be filled up at her di&s;cretion; for I dete&s;t the idea of &s;tipulating with a woman I adore. She knows the extent of my for|tune, and &s;he &s;hall have uncontroled liberty to make &s;uch a provi&s;ion for her&s;elf as &s;he &s;hall approve. I have only to add, that nothing will give me more di&s;plea&s;ure than to &s;hew an illtimed delicacy upon this occa|&s;ion. It will imply a doubt that I am not actuated by the mo&s;t generous principles, and that my liberality is not as unbounded as my love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, it you &s;uppo&s;e me actuated by the &s;ame principles, and &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition would be but doing me ju&s;tice, I mu&s;t de|cline every act that would pronounce a mercenary di&s;po&s;ition. If you, to convince me of your affection and genero&s;ity, are lib|eral to exce&s;s; my acceptance of &s;uch lib|erality, would betray a want of affection in me, and a &s;ordid ungenerous mind. Be&s;ides I have too high an idea of your probity and virtue, to &s;uppo&s;e that you can ever &s;ubmit to act di&s;honorably, merely becau&s;e there are

not &s;kins of parchment to oblige you to a contrary conduct. In &s;hort, Mr. Graham, I cannot prevail upon my&s;elf to agree to the humiliating terms which you have offered. I have a &s;pirit as liberal as your own, and, if I have not affluence to enable me to confer favors, I have the genero&s;ity to refu&s;e them, when they are pre&s;ented to me unmerit|ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. GRAHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your arguments, my deare&s;t girl, are too refined. I admire the noblene&s;s of your di&s;po&s;ition, and the delicacy of your feel|ings. But con&s;ider how infinitely I am your debtor, and how inadequate my whole for|tune is, to make any thing like a compen&s;a|tion for &s;o much beauty and perfection.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>LOUISA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in my re&s;olution to decline your generous offer; therefore let us change the conver&s;ation. Have you heard of an anecdote re&s;pecting a clergyman of our par|i&s;h?</P>

<P>This pari&s;h, you know, is pretty exten&s;ive&punc; and as Mr. Norton, our rector, was taking a ride near a remote corner of it, a &s;udden &s;hower of rain obliged him to &s;eek for &s;hel|ter; a poor female cottager, &s;eeing his di&s;|tre&s;s, invited him into her humble man&s;ion. He accepted her invitation, &s;eated him&s;elf by the fire, and after many earne&s;t entreaties from the poor but ho&s;pitable dame partook of a ra&s;her of her bacon. Mr. Norton's hor&s;e was, at the &s;ame time, conducted to a hovel, rubbed down, and plentifully refre&s;hed with hay and corn. Whil&s;t this reverend cler|gyman was &s;o cheerfully and generou&s;ly en|tertained by the good ho&s;te&s;s, he ob&s;erved, through a window which opened into a lit|tle orchard at the back part of the hou&s;e, a &s;ow attended by &s;everal pigs; and the pigs
<PB N="107" REF="035084_0106_100008431AA18910">
were ju&s;t of a proper age for the &s;pit: Struck by &s;o tempting an appearance, his reverence a&s;ked the hone&s;t cottager if the &s;ow and pigs belonged to her? She an&s;wered in the affirm|ative, when he humanely told her he was entitled to one of tho&s;e pigs and &s;hould &s;end his &s;ervant for it in the afternoon. The dame pleaded a large family, and the ex|treme difficulty of providing for it; and concluded with entreating him to forego his claim. The doctor was not to be di&s;&s;uaded from his purpo&s;e, he was peremptory in his demand, and actually &s;ent for the pig as he had threatened.</P>

<P>PREPARE your&s;elf, Belinda, for a mo&s;t alarming tale! How uncertain and in|&s;ecure are the plea&s;ures and ble&s;&s;ings of this life!&mdash;I, who but a few days ago thought my&s;elf the happie&s;t of mortals, and that joy and bli&s;s would con&s;tantly await me, have been plunged into the mo&s;t agonizing and unutterable di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>On Monday la&s;t, Mr. Graham pa&s;&s;ed the evening with me, and did not depart till it was unu&s;ually late. Finding the night advanced beyond his expectation, and un|willing to keep his &s;ervants from their re&s;t, in&s;tead of walking, he ran home, This ex|erci&s;e
<PB N="114" REF="035084_0113_100008719B0D6658">
being more violent than what he had been accu&s;tomed to, a violent per&s;piration en&s;ued, and after that a &s;wimming in the head. The be&s;t medical advice that could be procured in that country, was obtained the next morning. The doctor pronounced the malady a malignant fever, and of that dangerous kind, that he could not flatter the &s;orrowful attendants; with any hopes of his recovery.</P>
<P>Think, my Belinda, of the &s;hock I mu&s;t have &s;u&s;tained, on receiving &s;uch direful intelligence. I ha&s;tened to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and admini&s;tered to him all the comfort and con&s;olation in my poor power. Growing wor&s;e every &s;ucceeding day, he expected a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution, which, with tears in his eyes, he lamented, becau&s;e it would &s;ever him, he &s;aid, from his dear Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>My concern for his &s;ituation, which was too poignant to be concealed, affected him much. The tenderne&s;s of his expre&s;&s;ions but added to my affliction. He appeared, if po&s;&s;ible, more amiable to me now than ever! But the thought of lo&s;ing him planted dag|gers in my brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician, thinking his recovery not only doubtful, but almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, re|que&s;ted he would &s;ettle his affairs. The dear youth, with apparent re&s;ignation, gave
<PB N="115" REF="035084_0114_10000879B9CA0D58">
in&s;tructions for his will, which was accord|ingly prepared and executed.</P>
<P>Permit me to add, my Belinda, that I was the fir&s;t legatee named in this la&s;t te&s;ta|ment. He bequeathed me a thou&s;and pounds a year, and a &s;um of two thou&s;and pounds to be paid me immediately after his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>This additional proof of the &s;trength of his attachment to me, quite overcame me; I &s;wooned, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor. The alarm occa&s;ioned by this accident, &s;truck Mr. Graham like electricity. In &s;pite of the violence of his di&s;ea&s;e, he ro&s;e in his bed, and wanted to come to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but the attendants prudently withheld him. The ex|ertion both of mind and body on this oc|ca&s;ion, produced a cri&s;is to his di&s;ea&s;e; from that moment, he gradually recovered, and is, now thank heaven! perfectly re&s;tored to health.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that, after my &s;woon, I was taken from the floor and conveyed to a bed in an adjacent room; nor was it till the afternoon of the next day, that my &s;en&s;es were returned.</P>
<P>But, as &s;oon as rea&s;on rea&s;&s;umed her throne, I enquired, with fear and terror, af|ter my dear youth, and had the exalted hap|pine&s;s to be informed, that his recovery had been &s;o rapid, that he was pronounced out of
<PB N="116" REF="035084_0115_1000088534F52100">
danger. The mo&s;t enchanting mu&s;ic could not have &s;o delighted my ears, as the heav|enly accents which conveyed to me the ble&s;&s;ed intelligence!</P>
<P>I ran to the dear idol of my &s;oul to have this vi&s;ion realized, for I &s;till dreaded that it was all delu&s;ion! But, (ble&s;&s;ed be the Gods) the joyful news was true. As &s;oon as he beheld me, he greeted me with a benign &s;mile, expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;weetne&s;s and com|placency of his nature, and of the plea&s;ure he enjoyed in &s;eeing me. I fell on my knees and thanked Heaven for his recov|ery!</P>
<P>It was a delightful embarra&s;&s;ment that I experienced! Gratitude, affection, joy, al|ternately were my ruling pa&s;&s;ions. It al|mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hes me that my poor weak frame could &s;upport me under &s;uch a varie|ty of tran&s;ports!</P>
<P>In a few days Mr. Graham's health was perfectly rein&s;tated, and, with it, the ro&s;y hue which embelli&s;hes his manly cheek.&mdash; Pardon me, my Belinda, if I expre&s;s my&s;elf too warmly upon this intere&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash; To be cool and tranquil upon &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, would certainly be criminal! I feel my&s;elf too much elevated to be a mere nar|rator. My tran&s;ition from wretchedne&s;s to happine&s;s, was as &s;udden, as it was unex|pected!</P>

<P>I abandon the thoughts of all my other corre&s;pondents. The grave ones cannot a|mu&s;e me, nor the ridiculous ones divert me.

In &s;hort, we &s;eem to be in a regular train, and advancing, &s;tep by &s;tep, to the hymeneal altar. I wi&s;h our proceedings were le&s;s

gradual, and like yours, ha&s;tening to a hap|py conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Luckily, the rectory is now vacant of which my uncle has the advow&s;en; and con|&s;equently the right of pre&s;entation. I have acquainted that worthy relation of mine, with the overtures I have received from Mr. Proby, but without mentioning the origin|al cau&s;e; and he perfectly approves of him, after a minute inve&s;tigation of his charac|ter and connexions. He has even promi&s;ed, as an addition to my fortune, to pre&s;ent my intended to the living in his di&s;po&s;al, pro|vided an union &s;hould take place between us.</P>
<P>This generous offer I have communicat|ed to my reverened &s;wain; which was high|ly gratifying to him, as it te&s;tified my con|&s;ent, in the mo&s;t unequivocal terms, to be|&s;tow on him my hand.</P>
<P>Still, however, he laments that his &s;itua|tion is &s;o inadequate to mine, and expre&s;&s;|es his fears that I &s;hould hereafter look on him in the light of an adventurer or fortune hunter. Though I approve of the delicacy of his ob&s;ervations, I endeavor to di&s;cour|age &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions.</P>
<P>I doubt not of his &s;incerity, when he a&s;|&s;ures me, as he often does in the mo&s;t po&s;i|tive terms that he &s;hould be happy to become mine, though I did not po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;hilling in
<PB N="121" REF="035084_0120_100008AF4E29FDE8">
the world; not doubting but his endeavors would at lea&s;t procure a competence and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hes to &s;ettle the whole of my for|tune, which you know is con&s;iderable, up|on my&s;elf; but I reprobate &s;uch an idea; &s;corning to act a mercenary part with a man of &s;o liberal a di&s;po&s;ition, and a man who, I am convinced, loves me for my&s;elf alone.</P>
<P>He candidly acknowledges that at pre&s;|ent, his chief clerical emoluments ari&s;e from a &s;mall curacy; and exclu&s;ive of that, he has only a fellow&s;hip in St. John's college, Oxford, which of cour&s;e, terminates with his marriage.&mdash;But, what of that! He is a gentleman, in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive acceptation, and, with a due e&s;timation of his merits, I think him my &s;uperior.</P>
<P>Your opinion, my Loui&s;a, upon a mat|ter of this importance, would be acceptable; and yet, if it did not concur with mine, I believe I &s;hould reject it; but, if it &s;hould, as I know you would give it me ingenuou&s;|ly, it would afford me infinite &s;atisfaction, and encourage me to proceed. At all events, however, favor me with your &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Though I am happy at having procured, by my adverti&s;ement, one worthy man, I la|ment that I have expo&s;ed my&s;elf to the &s;neers and in&s;ults of the malignant and the
<PB N="122" REF="035084_0121_100008BA5296D1D0">
vulgar. In addition to the catalogue of char|acters, which I have already given you, an im|pertinent auctioneer has had the audacity to &s;end me a letter, replete with deri&s;ion and vulgarity. He impudently offers, his &s;ervi|ces to fell me by <HI>hand,</HI> by <HI>auction,</HI> or by <HI>inch of candle.</HI> Thank heaven the&s;e infamous fel|lows know nothing of me, but my chri&s;tian name!</P>
<P>It plea&s;es me exceedingly, my Loui&s;a, that my uncle &s;o well approves of the man of my choice; and he approves of him from a conviction of his de&s;erts. Had there been a blemi&s;h in the character or conduct of Mr. Proby, my uncle's penetration would have di&s;covered it; but they have &s;tood the te&s;t of the &s;evere&s;t examination, and he is pro|nounced immaculate.</P>
<P>You will perhaps accu&s;e me of incohe|rency; and indeed, with ju&s;tice you may accu&s;e me: But indulgencies are allowable to per&s;ons in my &s;ituation&mdash;I had almo&s;t &s;aid to lovers. Though intent upon one object, they ramble from circum&s;tance to circum&s;tance, that ultimately tend to the &s;ame point.</P>
<P>I fear you will think me tedious, my Loui&s;a; but, on &s;o intere&s;ting a theme, you mu&s;t excu&s;e my prolixity. Our ca&s;es in|deed are &s;omewhat &s;imilar, and no difficulty can occur in framing excu&s;es for each other.</P>

<P>THE la&s;t po&s;t conveyed an epi&s;tle from Belinda to her friend Loui&s;a; the &s;ub|&s;equent mail contains di&s;patches from the &s;ame corre&s;pondent, and to the &s;ame re&s;pect|ed friend.</P>
<P>Wonder not Loui&s;a, that I did not wait till I had received your an&s;wer to my la&s;t before I impo&s;ed another heavy ta&s;k upon you. I hinted to you in the po&s;t &s;cript, that another large packet of letters had arrived from my di&s;per&s;ed lovers; but I have &s;ome further particulars to mention with regard to my new wooers. Not many of them are inhabitants of London, or its environs; many of them, indeed, re&s;ide at a con&s;id|erable di&s;tance from the metropolis, as ap|pears by the place whence they are dated, as well as from the corroborating po&s;t|mark.</P>
<P>That the&s;e billets did not arrive &s;ooner, is ea&s;ily accounted for: Some days mu&s;t have elap&s;ed before the new&s;paper, in which
<PB N="125" REF="035084_0124_100008E306631220">
my adverti&s;ement appeared, could have been circulated over the di&s;tant counties; a further delay mu&s;t have been required, to enable my rural adorers to pen one of their be&s;t epi&s;tles; and no incon&s;iderable time was nece&s;&s;ary to convey them from the re|&s;pective towns and villages, to the grand centre of corre&s;pondence and communica|tion.</P>
<P>Upwards of one hundred and fifty propo|&s;als have I received by the general po&s;t, all franked by the payment of the po&s;tage; the revenue will therefore be &s;omewhat enrich|ed in con&s;equence of my &s;ingular project.</P>
<P>Had I not proceeded &s;o far with Mr. Proby, I might doubtle&s;s have made a prudent choice among the&s;e new candidates.&mdash;Many of them appear to be comfortably &s;ituated, and independent; others candidly and in|genuou&s;ly &s;tate their difficulties, as well as their pro&s;pects; but mo&s;t of them exhibit &s;trong <HI>traits</HI> of integrity and honor. To enable you to judge of the difference be|tween my London and country corre&s;pond|ents, I have enclo&s;ed tho&s;e di&s;patches, which &s;eem mo&s;t to claim attention.

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. <HI>HENRY HEATHFIELD,</HI> to <HI>BELINDA.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ENCOURAGED by your addre&s;s to the public, I have ventured as an individu|al of that public to offer you my devoirs.&mdash; Suppo&s;ing you in earne&s;t, I take the liberty of informing you, that I am as willing as your&s;elf to alter my condition.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf that you can have no ob|jection to my &s;ituation; as I am far re|moved from poverty, and rather border up|on affluence. I have an e&s;tate of one hun|dred and thirty pounds a year, which I keep in my own hands, and manage in the mo&s;t advantageous manner that I am able. Be|ing my own landlord, my &s;tock or movea|bles can never be di&s;trained for rent, a cir|cum&s;tance which affords me no incon&s;idera|ble con&s;olation.</P>
<P>But, though the &s;oil is my own, as it con|&s;i&s;ts principally of grazing land, &s;ome money
<PB N="127" REF="035084_0126_100009000E0C11C0">
is nece&s;&s;ary to enable me to &s;tock it as it ought to be. If I cannot purcha&s;e &s;heep and cattle to be fattened on that land, the emolu|ments which I &s;hall derive from it will not &s;upport me, and much le&s;s a family: I am therefore inclined to think that your money, joined to my e&s;tate would place ev|ery thing upon a proper footing, and enable us to live comfortably and genteely. Per|haps, however, you may think differently: If you do, I mu&s;t look out for &s;ome other worthy woman, who has got a few hun|dreds.</P>
<P>Till we agree about pecuniary con&s;idera|tions, I would not wi&s;h to have an inter|view. I am &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the influence of beauty again&s;t my &s;tronge&s;t re&s;olutions, that all my cautions and &s;tipulations mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed during the epi&s;tolary treaty.</P>
<P>Having mentioned my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, you will perhaps expect &s;ome account of my per&s;on, and &s;uch other particulars as are u&s;|ually the topics of inve&s;tigation, previous to an union of hands and fortunes.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;end my picture, as my figure has never been delineated by a Reynolds, a Gain&s;borough, or any other arti&s;t. The following, however, are the genuine out|lines of my per&s;on, for I never flattered any man: I am rough and unpoli&s;hed, as you may well imagine, having received my ed|ucation
<PB N="128" REF="035084_0127_1000090C86E65B80">
among the fens in Lincoln&s;hire. I am ju&s;t now entering my twentyfifth year; am about five feet eight inches in height; and rather thin than corpulent. I have a homely country face, with a dark brown head of hair, unfa&s;hioned by the hands of the frizzeur.</P>
<P>To you it may &s;eem extraordinary that I cannot make a proper matrimonial connex|ion in my own country. Though this ob|&s;ervation might naturally occur to many per&s;ons, yet in this part of the world it is not applicable; except ab&s;olute paupers, here are but two cla&s;&s;es of women, the rich and the middling. By the former I am con|&s;idered as infinitely their inferior, and any overtures of marriage made to any of them, would be pronounced an in&s;ult not to be forgiven; though, perhaps, in point of for|tune, I am equal with the greater part of them. To the other cla&s;s, my pride will not &s;uffer me to de&s;cend, as I &s;hould be un|happy with a woman wholly unaccompli&s;h|ed; I would wi&s;h her to po&s;&s;e&s;s a cultivated mind.</P>
<P>That you are an object of attraction, I cannot doubt: With a becoming mode&s;ty, you acknowledge it. If you think me en|titled to your &s;lighte&s;t notice, favor we with a line, to which I will render due obedi|ence.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="035084_0128_0FFFB53D50AC3FE0">I mu&s;t do my&s;elf the ju&s;tice to declare, that, though I am a plodding farmer, I have had the education of a gentleman. This in|formation is not given from motives of vanity, but to convince you that an alliance with me will be le&s;s a degradation to your family.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACCEPT of me as a corre&s;pondent, in an&s;wer to your alluring adverti&s;ement. To &s;hew what pretentions I have to a pref|erence in your choice, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to mention who and what I am. That ta&s;k, however, will be attended with &s;ome dif|ficulty, as I hardly know who and what I am my&s;elf, having been in &s;uch a variety of &s;ituations, during the &s;hort period that I have exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>Having been pretty liberally educated, I was fir&s;t apprenticed to a &s;urgeon in the country; but I had too much timidity and tenderne&s;s in my di&s;po&s;ition to arrive at any degree of eminence in that butcherly bu&s;i|ne&s;s; I therefore quitted it, and engaged in a trade equally &s;anguinary. My father purcha&s;ed a pair of colors for me in a marching regiment, and with my &s;carlet uni|form,
<PB N="132" REF="035084_0131_1000093F1A364FD8">
epaulette, and flaming cockade, I cut a mo&s;t tremendous figure.</P>
<P>Feeling the con&s;equence of a military character, I &s;ometimes ventured to hector and blu&s;ter, among tho&s;e whom I &s;uppo&s;ed had not a &s;ufficient &s;hare of &s;pirit to call me to an account for my in&s;olent behavior. For a long time I enjoyed the reputation of valor, and was in hopes that no one would ever put my courage to the te&s;t. At length, however, I received a formal challenge, from a young gentleman whom I had in&s;ult|ed, and I did not feel my&s;elf bold.</P>
<P>I conde&s;cended to a&s;k pardon in the mo&s;t humiliating terms, but my petition was re|jected with contempt. What was to be done? I knew my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a natural mildne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, and could not bear the thoughts of drawing blood from any human creature. I remon&s;trated with my antagoni&s;t, who al&s;o bore the king's com|mi&s;&s;ion, on the impropriety of expo&s;ing two military lives to danger, in con&s;equence of a fooli&s;h private quarrel, when there was an appearance of their &s;ervices being &s;peed|ily required, to cha&s;ti&s;e the in&s;olence of the enemies of their country.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, in&s;tead of abating, rou&s;ed the rage of my challenger; he grew bold, in proportion as I exhibited &s;igns of fear and trepidation.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="035084_0132_10000950D7A17428">He threatened to po&s;t me for a coward, if I would not meet him at a certain hour in Hyde Park; adding, that I might rely on finding him and his &s;econd there at the ap|pointed time.</P>
<P>Not wi&s;hing to purcha&s;e honor at the ri&s;que of my life, I &s;oon came to a re&s;olu|tion how to conduct my&s;elf in this bu&s;ine&s;s. I knew that, if I refu&s;ed to fight my man, my military profe&s;&s;ion was no longer tena|ble. In&s;tead of meeting the hero and his &s;econd, I went to a proper agent to find a purcha&s;er for my commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>My commi&s;&s;ion having been bought, I was permitted to di&s;po&s;e of it; but had it been given me, no &s;uch indulgence would have been permitted; I mu&s;t have re&s;igned with infamy.</P>
<P>I was not greatly chagrined at this occur|rence. Finding that a man of a forgiving turn of mind, was a de&s;picable character a|mong &s;oldiers, I was determined to enter into a line of life, where a man might dare to be a coward without becoming infamous. My next &s;tep was to qualify for the church. A few le&s;&s;ons from an old clergyman, with whom my father was acquainted, enabled me to rub up my Latin and Greek, and I found no great difficulty in getting ordain|ed.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="035084_0133_100009525C3D04E8">Here I indulged my talent for declama|tion without control, and without danger of murder or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. I declared in&s;tant war again&s;t Satan and his mini&s;ters; and made it, for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">e time, my whole &s;tudy to blacken tho&s;e characters, though they never had offended me. I knew my&s;elf perfectly &s;afe, in this kind of &s;candal and abu&s;e, as I had no apprehen&s;ions of a &s;ummons to Hyde Park.</P>
<P>My &s;alary as a curate, for I never had either rectory or vicarage, was about equal to the pay I had received as an en&s;ign; and I had &s;ome ca&s;ual extra fees on performing certain ceremonies annexed to my clerical function. I now thought my&s;elf happy and independant; but, hearing that many clerical gentlemen had worked them&s;elves into a good fat living by abu&s;ing the mini&s;|try, I &s;et to work immediately; and, if a|bu&s;e is worthy of a reward in proportion to its rancor, I ought at lea&s;t to have had a mitre.</P>
<P>I proved that there was not a man of in|tegrity or under&s;tanding in the cabinet; that the bi&s;hops had no charity, and the maids of honor no cha&s;tity; and that neither our admirals or generals could endure the &s;mell of gunpowder.</P>
<P>Not thinking I had gone far enough to be noticed, I even &s;candalized a few princes.
<PB N="135" REF="035084_0134_10000956094E33C0">
This indeed occa&s;ioned my &s;trictures to be attended to, and I was promoted to&mdash;a place in Newgate.

<P>It would not have become me to contend with my judges; therefore, as a means of mitigating damages, I urged the plea of poverty; no man could have &s;ee forth &s;uch a plea with more propriety than my&s;elf, for my little all was di&s;tributed in fees among the black gentlemen in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall. My whole <HI>per&s;onal</HI> e&s;tate (and I had nothing <HI>real</HI>) did not at that time amount to more than nineteen pence three farthings.</P>
<P>Having proved my&s;elf a pauper, by affi|davit, I thought I was perfectly &s;ecure from having any pecuniary penalties impo&s;ed upon me; but when I reflected on the pro|bability of &s;ub&s;tituting impri&s;onment for fine, I felt my&s;elf a little unea&s;y. Imagin|ation

<P>At a day appointed, I was pre&s;ented be|fore the &s;olemn tribunal, as a culprit con|vict, to be made acquainted with the pun|i&s;hment due to my demerits. With great humanity, I was informed, that, previous to the pronouncing of the &s;entence, I was at liberty to &s;ay any thing which I &s;uppo&s;ed might tend to extenuate my guilt.</P>
<P>Imagining that a real &s;tatement of facts might probably an&s;wer my purpo&s;e, better than a &s;tring of improbabilities which I could ea&s;ily have invented, I related to my judges, "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."</P>

been purcha&s;ed, his &s;ilence only was requir|ed.</P>
<P>"Recollecting the particulars of this bu|&s;ine&s;s, and with what ea&s;e a comfortable in|dependence might be acquired, I commenc|ed &s;cribbler, and produced the pamphlet which, from what at pre&s;ent appears, will turn out much le&s;s advantageous to me than I expected.</P>
<P>"Believe me, gentlemen, this is the real fact: I had no malice again&s;t any of the per&s;ons whom I have vilified. I meant no injury to them: I wi&s;hed only to benefit my&s;elf, and to become an adequate &s;uit|or to the lady who&s;e hand I had &s;olicit|ed."</P>
<P>I concluded by ob&s;erving, that, if I was not thought entitled to a reward, like the fortunate friend I had mentioned, I hoped the court would not think me de&s;erving of further puni&s;hment, having been already under lock and key for upwards of &s;even weeks.</P>
<P>Having, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;poken much to the purpo&s;e, and excited the compa&s;&s;ion of my judges, I expected a &s;entence of the mo&s;t lenient kind. One month's impri&s;onment, and a fine of thirteen &s;hillings and four|pence, was the utmo&s;t that I dreaded; but I found my&s;elf exceedingly mi&s;taken:&mdash;The compo&s;ition by which I thought to have
<PB N="139" REF="035084_0138_0FFFB554436366B0">
rai&s;ed an independance, if not affluence, procured me the following &s;entence. To be two years impri&s;oned, to &s;tand twice on the pillory, to pay a fine of &s;ix &s;hillings and eightpence, and to find &s;ureties for my good behavior for &s;even years.</P>
<P>I was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, and in|dignation, at the apparent &s;everity of this judgment; but I was compelled to be obe|dient, and to repair immediately to the mi&s;erable man&s;ion de&s;tined to receive me.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of liberty I could have &s;ubmitt|ed to with &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure; but the idea of exhibiting my face to the multi|tude, through an ignominious wooden frame, was in&s;upportable. Is this my reward, ex|claimed I, for turning politician? For my attempts to regulate mankind, and point out their duty and defects, I am to have the elevated &s;tation of &s;urveyor of the pave|ments!</P>
<P>After innumerable applications to my friends and relatives, &s;ome of whom move in a &s;phere truly re&s;pectable, I obtained a remi&s;&s;ion of the ignominious part of my &s;en|tence; the pillory was therefore removed from my affrighted imagination.</P>
<P>By affected &s;orrow and contrition, and repeated prote&s;tations that I would never more appear in the character of a politician, further indulgences were extended to me:
<PB N="140" REF="035084_0139_100009680A387868">
After the expiration of one year, in&s;tead of two, I was &s;et at liberty; and even without entering into a recognizance, with &s;urities for my future good "abearing."</P>
<P>Finding my&s;elf in the wide world much &s;ooner than I had expected, I had not planned a mode of life which would enable me to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: My mind had been &s;o humbled by my &s;ufferings, that I had no ambition beyond that of being ena|bled to get my bread. The flame of pa&s;&s;ion, which beauty had rai&s;ed within my bo&s;om, had become perfectly extingui&s;hed. My ap|parel, like my&s;elf, had lo&s;t much of its bloom, and I knew the world too well to expect civility and attention in a threadbare coat. Be&s;ides, the re&s;idence which I had quitted, did not reflect any con&s;iderable de|gree of honor upon its tenants; I could not therefore build any pretentions to commi&s;|eration on that account.</P>
<P>I directed my &s;teps from pri&s;on, to the hou&s;e of my &s;i&s;ter; a worthy creature, and a per&s;on for whom I had much affection and e&s;teem: Our tenderne&s;s for each other was indeed reciprocal; for, though &s;he knew me to be eccentric, &s;he knew al&s;o that I was rather an oddity than an infamous abandon|ed calumniator.</P>
<P>So rejoiced was &s;he at my liberation, that, as &s;oon as &s;he beheld me, &s;he threw
<PB N="141" REF="035084_0140_1000096C26284B98">
her&s;elf into my arms, and felicitated me heartily on my acce&s;&s;ion to liberty, regard|le&s;s of my di&s;gu&s;ting appearance. A &s;uit of cloaths of her procuring, clean linen, and every comfortable appendage, enabled me to ca&s;t off my wretched covering, in which poverty and filth were too con&s;picuou&s;ly portrayed. With my ragged and dirty hab|iliments. I al&s;o &s;hook off a train of attend|ants, which never fail to be in the &s;uite of wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But though I was received with affection and regard by my beloved &s;i&s;ter, and might have quartered my&s;elf upon her for a long time, before &s;he would even have hinted any di&s;approbation of my conduct in &s;o do|ing; I had too much &s;pirit to live upon alms, and re&s;olved &s;peedily to engage in ac|tive life.</P>
<P>To my clerical profe&s;&s;ion it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for me to return: My crime and pun|i&s;hment, and more particularly my &s;entence, had &s;tamped my character with indelia|ble infamy, and rendered me unworthy of appearing in an eccle&s;ia&s;tical habit. Could I have had the audacity to rea&s;&s;ume the &s;ac|red robe, the ordinary would doubtle&s;s have &s;tripped me of it with indignity and de|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">adation.</P>
<P>While I was ruminating on the&s;e, and other di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances, an over|ture
<PB N="142" REF="035084_0141_0FFFB55B6D5FF780">
in one of the public prints particularly arre&s;ted my attention: An itinerant compa|ny of comedians, at no great di&s;tance from the metropolis, wanted a <HI>gentleman</HI> to en|gage in their little troupe, a vacancy having been occa&s;ioned by the de&s;ertion of one of their principal members. Nothing was &s;aid about terms; but it was reque&s;ted that no per&s;on would apply who had not a compe|tent knowledge of theatrical concerns, and was able to give &s;atisfaction, both in tragedy and comedy, to a genteel and brilliant au|dience.</P>
<P>Having always delighted in dramatic po|etry, and perfectly remembering the mo&s;t &s;triking &s;cenes in Shake&s;pear, O<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">way. Con|greve, Sheridan, and other celebrated writ|ers, I thought I &s;hould &s;oon be capable of appearing in &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking characters; e&s;pecially as I fortunately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a quick as well a retentive mem|ory.</P>
<P>I repaired to Hendon, whither the adver|ti&s;ement directed me, and was ceremoniou&s;|ly introduced to the two managers. After &s;ome conver&s;ation on this important bu&s;i|ne&s;s, a rehear&s;al of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages was re|quired, by way of &s;pecimen of my theatric ta&s;te and talents. Luckily my endeavo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> were approved; terms were propo&s;ed, and I acceded to them. In con&s;ideration of my
<PB N="143" REF="035084_0142_1000096ED7327230">
great merit, (as the&s;e dramatic &s;overeigns ex|pre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves) I was to receive &s;even &s;hillings a week, and to have a <HI>clear benefit,</HI> at every town or village in which they thought proper to perform.</P>
<P>That no mi&s;under&s;tanding might happen between me and my augu&s;t ma&s;ters, I was informed, it was expected that I &s;hould find my own clean linen and &s;tockings; but with regard to every thing el&s;e, I might de|pend upon a proper &s;upply from their exten|&s;ive wardrobe.</P>
<P>Preliminaries being thus adju&s;ted, I en|tered upon my new duty, and, as I thought, performed wonders. I &s;hone forth in the characters of Lear, Richard the Third, Ham|let, Macbeth. Kitely, Abel Drugger and Marplot. To the audience I gave uncom|mon &s;atisfaction, and commanded from them bur&s;ts of applau&s;e, whenever I mani|fe&s;ted a nice di&s;crimination of character, and gave evident proofs that I entered into the &s;pirit and meaning of the author.</P>
<P>Thinking I had now got a permanent em|ployment, though not a very lucrative one&punc; I found my&s;elf &s;omewhat happier than I was in Newgate; but, &s;o uncertain are all hu|man affairs, my merit, in my new profe&s;|&s;ion, was my de&s;truction. The managers, notwith&s;tanding the theatre was crammed every evening on my account, began
<PB N="144" REF="035084_0143_100009756CA5A060">
to look on me with a jealous eye. Their nightly receipts doubly exceeded the &s;ums which they had ever taken, but that was not thought a &s;ufficient recompence for the lo&s;s of fame and con&s;equence: They had been accu&s;tomed to &s;hare the plaudits, as well as the profits of the hou&s;e; but now their fine&s;t acting was di&s;regarded, and I en|gro&s;&s;ed the whole of the applau&s;e.</P>
<P>I now perceived that I was in danger of expul&s;ion from our &s;ociety. I was &s;o crit|ically &s;ituated, that I knew not what &s;teps to pur&s;ue. My offence was of &s;o &s;ingular a kind, that I could not correct it, without reducing the income of my ma&s;ters, and ex|po&s;ing my&s;elf to ridicule and contempt.</P>
<P>I daily expected a di&s;charge, but my gov|ernors were &s;o far actuated by the princi|ples of honor and con&s;cience, that I was fir&s;t permitted to have a benefit; and that benefit was much more productive than I expected. Believe me, Madam, I received the neat &s;um of &s;even pounds, nineteen &s;hillings, and &s;ixpence. So prodigious an accumulation of ca&s;h, in one evening, is not extant in the annals of our compa|ny.</P>
<P>Early the next morning, my two govern|ors di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to my apartment, to inform me that my attendance on them was expected at a certain hour, which they
<PB N="145" REF="035084_0144_1000097713CC6BA0">
had appointed. I obeyed the mandate, and was received rather ceremoniou&s;ly than cor|dially. Appearing in a &s;ubaltern character, I reque&s;ted to be favored with their com|mands.</P>
<P>The &s;enior of the&s;e two kings of Brent|ford, after having thrice &s;troked his chin, deigned to addre&s;s me thus, "Far be it from us, Mr. Proteus, to complain of the manner of your conducting bu&s;ine&s;s; your abilities, as a comedian, are great, very great; they are of the fir&s;t magnitude. We cannot there|fore think of retaining a gentleman of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, in our vagrant troupe. Your efforts cannot fail of placing you at the head of one of the London theatres; and we &s;hould act a villainous part to rob you of your de&s;erved emoluments, or to deprive per&s;ons of di&s;tinction of that &s;atis|faction which your performances cannot fail to give. Permit me to add, Mr. Proteus, that human nature, is human nature; we have all a &s;pice of vanity in our compo&s;ition, and a man does not like to be totally eclip&s;ed, after having been allowed to &s;hine with &s;ome degree of lu&s;tre for many years. To be plain with you, Sir, your talents are too &s;plendid for our plain company.&mdash;While you continue with us, the audience come only to &s;ee and hear you: When you are gone they will, as before, be &s;atisfied
<PB N="146" REF="035084_0145_1000097D16215438">
with our poor exertions, and &s;ometimes con|de&s;cend to favor us with their plaudits. I believe, Mr. Proteus, I need not explain my|&s;elf any farther; your penetration can ea&s;i|ly di&s;cover my meaning. In &s;hort, Sir, it will be for our mutual benefit and &s;atisfac|tion to &s;eparate as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>The other manager bowed a&s;&s;ent; and I did not oppo&s;e my di&s;charge, it was convey|ed to me in &s;uch flattering terms. The con|duct of my ma&s;ters reminded me of that of the late Briti&s;h Ro&s;cius, who, thinking a|nother player &s;uperior to him in a few cha|racters, engaged that player at a <HI>large</HI> &s;alary, to lay him on the <HI>&s;helf,</HI> as it is termed. By this &s;tep he prevented a formidable oppo&s;i|tion at the other hou&s;e; and he completely prevented it on his own boards, becau&s;e he was limited to an inferior ca&s;t of charac|ters.</P>
<P>My vanity fea&s;ted not a little, on the idea of being di&s;carded for having too much merit; and I was the better reconciled to my de&s;tiny, as my benefit had lodged a few &s;hiners in my pocket.</P>
<P>After thanking my governors for their civility, and receiving a balance due to me of a few &s;hillings, I took my leave of them, and bade adieu to the wooden theatre of Hendon.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="035084_0146_1000097E9BCC8FD8">No expen&s;e attended my removal; my goods and chattles were all per&s;onal, my whole wardrobe being upon my back.</P>
<P>Not thinking &s;o highly of my&s;elf, (not|with&s;tanding the flattering circum&s;tances which I have mentioned) as to &s;uppo&s;e I was qualified to make my appearance at either of the royal theatres, I took the di|rect road to Bath. I thought my&s;elf, at lea&s;t, capable of being tran&s;planted into that flouri&s;hing theatrical garden.</P>
<P>I remain at pre&s;ent in that city, and ex|pect daily to be incorporated and inrolled with the per&s;ons of the drama, who perform alternately there, and at Bri&s;tol, another city at the di&s;tance of about twelve miles.</P>
<P>Soon after my arrival here, madam, chance threw your adverti&s;ement before my eyes. I re&s;olved immediately to become your corre&s;pondent, called for pen, ink and paper, and wrote this long epi&s;tle, perhaps too &s;evere a trial for your patience.</P>
<P>Though I am a whim&s;ical kind of being madam, I would &s;corn to impo&s;e on any woman. I have given an hone&s;t, candid, and ingenuous account of my&s;elf; and if, after due con&s;ideration, you think I have any claim to your attention, you will pro|bably favor me with a line. If, on the other hand, you &s;hould deem me an impertinent puppy, you are at liberty to burn this letter,

which co&s;t me upwards of two hours labor, and with it all remembrance of your itiner|ant corre&s;pondent.</P>
<P>You, Madam, are now in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my genuine hi&s;tory. I have not attempt|ed to glo&s;s or mi&s;repre&s;ent a &s;ingle circum|&s;tance.

<P>PERMIT a Welchman to be one of your wooers. Though my income is not very con&s;iderable, I am a gentleman from my profe&s;&s;ion. I am a clergyman, and the vicar of a pari&s;h. Many years have I been curate, but I am now preferred to a liv|ing of ten pounds a year clear of deduc|tions.</P>

With my own income, and the intere&s;t of your money, we can afford to make a very re&s;pectable figure in this country. Very few could equal us in &s;plendor and magnificence, and hardly any would be able to excel us.</P>
<P>I am a widower almo&s;t without incum|brance, being left with only two boys and the &s;ame number of girls: So &s;mall a fam|ily will not, I hope, be con&s;idered as any ob&s;tacle to our nuptials.</P>

<P>As there is a po&s;&s;ibility of our not con|cluding the bu&s;ine&s;s, on which we are now treating, I think it fair and equitable for each party to pay half the po&s;tage of this letter; I have therefore paid my moiety, and cau&s;ed the words <HI>half po&s;t paid</HI> to be written on the out&s;ide, not doubting but you will advance an equal &s;um.

<P>You will be &s;urpri&s;ed, Madam, at having a man of ninety, among your train of admir|ers. To that age I am now arrived; and if you are a &s;teady, prudent lady, you will not object to that age. I have got rid of tho&s;e hoity toity boyi&s;h actions which render young men ridiculous; and I have clipped the wings of my extravagance, which for|merly conducted me into every &s;pecies of riot and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="035084_0155_10014ACC92C9C0E0">There is another con&s;ideration, Madam, worth attending to, and which will doubt|le&s;s have its due weight with you, as a wom|an of di&s;cretion. There is not &s;o much danger of having a large family of children, as there might have been, &s;uppo&s;ing I was &s;ixty or &s;eventy years younger. A dozen or two of children are not to be &s;upported with a trifle, at the rate provi&s;ions now are, and therefore they would be an incum|brance to us.</P>
<P>Some incon&s;iderate women would per|haps object to my age, but what's ninety years! I am but a boy among &s;ome of my acquaintance! a mere chicken! If the lady I am thus addre&s;&s;ing, has any knowledge of the world, (and I am convinced &s;he has by the terms in which her adverti&s;ement is couched) &s;he will take an early opportunity of &s;ending a line to her mo&s;t humble Ser|vant,</P>

<P>Such, my Loui&s;a, are the epi&s;tles which I have lately received, but they are not the whole: They are a few &s;elected from &s;ev|eral large budgets or packets; the cream, the quinte&s;cence of the whole. Imagine then, my dear girl, what tra&s;h the others mu&s;t have contained!</P>
<P>If the peru&s;al of the tran&s;cripts of letters which I have now &s;ent you, &s;hould afford

you any diver&s;ion or amu&s;ement, my pur|po&s;e is an&s;wered; I had no other mo|tive for undertaking the ta&s;k of copying them.</P>
<P>I have the &s;atisfaction of acquainting my Loui&s;a, that the tender negociation between Mr. Proby and my&s;elf, &s;eems to advance rapidly, without ob&s;tacle or interruption. You and I, my dear friend, are &s;teering for the &s;ame haven. May no adver&s;e and tempe&s;tuous winds drive us again into the ocean of uncertainty, and da&s;h us again&s;t the rocks of di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall impatiently expect an an&s;wer to this letter; and &s;urely I have an immedi|ate claim to one epi&s;tle, now you are too long ones in arrear. Let me entreat you to give a circum&s;tantial diary of every tran&s;|action of importance in your part of the world, &s;ince the date of your la&s;t. When I &s;ay, "every tran&s;action of importance" I mean every tran&s;action of what kind &s;oev|er; for every thing mu&s;t be of importance to me, which in the lea&s;t concerns my Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>Among the billets, which this po&s;t con|veys to you that from Peter Protius is cer|tainly the foremo&s;t in point of literary mer|it. Whether in je&s;t or earne&s;t, there is &s;omething plea&s;ingly whim&s;ical in the char|acter he has given of him&s;elf; and he can|didly acknowledges, without a blu&s;h, that
<PB N="158" REF="035084_0157_10014AD58DE576F0">
he is an arrant coward. He has ventured, however, to give me a challenge; but were I to accept it, perhaps he would flinch as he did when his military antagoni&s;t dar|ed him to the field: In love, as well as war, there are many who pa&s;s for daring or blu&s;|tering heroes, who &s;hew &s;trong &s;ymptoms of timidity, when honor calls them upon actu|al duty.</P>
<P>My lover of ninety might perhaps &s;tand a chance, if he was the only man exi&s;ting upon earth. His argument on the method of avoiding incumbrances, will not be much attended to. You will think I have no mer|cy on you, if I do not in&s;tantly re&s;ign my pen. It will have performed its ta&s;k for the pre&s;ent, when it has again a&s;&s;ured you that I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. <HI>LOUISA LENOX,</HI> to <HI>BELINDA BLACKET.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MY be&s;t thanks are due to you, Be|linda, for your very obliging letters; but how am I to make an adequate return! If you expect &s;heet for &s;heet, or line for line as you &s;trongly intimate, to whom can I ap|ply for materials? In a remote part of the country, a dearth of incidents is to be ex|pected and I hope my Belinda would not wi&s;h me to invent tales, or even to adopt exaggeration upon facts, purely to &s;well out an epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>I have regularly communicated to you our progre&s;s in the road to happine&s;s. I can have nothing fre&s;h to impart to you on that bu&s;ine&s;s (highly important bu&s;ine&s;s to me!) till it is concluded, confirmed, and ratified. That day of accompli&s;hment is not far di&s;tant&mdash;"Fly &s;wiftly, ye minutes!"</P>
<P>As you have frequently expre&s;&s;ed a de|&s;ire to know the method of killing time, a|mid&s;t the woods and groves, I think I can convey an idea of it, by relating to you the
<PB N="160" REF="035084_0159_10014AD8956E8AB0">
particulars of a &s;plendid entertainment, to which I was invited as a gue&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Dighton, ju&s;t come of age, acquired his father's dignity about three years ago, but could not fully po&s;&s;e&s;s his large e&s;tate till he attained the age of twen|tyone years. On Wedne&s;day la&s;t he arriv|ed at the period which legally pronounced him Man; and the happy day was u&s;hered in with the ringing of bells, dancing round the maypole, and every ru&s;tic method of expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t lively demon&s;trations of joy. Sir Thomas's genero&s;ity on this occa|&s;ion was unbounded. Particular invita|tions were given to all the genteel families in the environs of his &s;eat, and a general proclamation was circulated, that all his tenants, &s;ervants and neighbors, were ex|pected to repair to Dighton Hall, to partake of the fe&s;tivity of the day: So exten&s;ive was his idea of be&s;towing plenty and good cheer, that pea&s;ants and paupers were not exclud|ed!</P>
<P>Auxiliary cooks from the metropolis were engaged upon this joyful occa&s;ion; and, that the ears of the company might be fea&s;t|ed with extatic &s;ounds, the be&s;t vocal and in&s;trumental performers were procured from the &s;ame great capital.</P>
<P>Every luxury of the table was abundantly &s;upplied. Wines of the mo&s;t expen&s;ive
<PB N="161" REF="035084_0160_10014ADD131B4410">
kind, were as liberally be&s;towed as if they were e&s;timated but as water. This was pe|culiarly the ca&s;e among the fir&s;t cla&s;s of the vi&s;itors, who attended. Tho&s;e who were deemed the &s;econd in rank, were entertained in an apartment le&s;s magnificent, but their fare was hardly inferior to that which was provided for tho&s;e who moved in a more elevated &s;phere of life.</P>
<P>A third cla&s;s was entertained with almo&s;t equal pageantry and profu&s;ion; and the la&s;t divi&s;ion, far exceeding all the others in point of number, were abundantly &s;upplied with good Old Engli&s;h provender, and fine &s;parking ale; &s;ome of the latter was as aged as the young baronet, who&s;e majority they were celebrating.</P>
<P>The park and gardens received the over|flowings of the man&s;ion: Many hundreds of the delighted neighbors regaled them|&s;elves <HI>el fre&s;co,</HI> under the &s;hade of trees and &s;hrubberies&punc; the &s;oliage of which became tremulous by the gentle breeze fanning and refre&s;hing the company in the performance of their ta&s;k; that of quaffing frequent li|bations to the pro&s;perity of their generous and indulgent ho&s;t.</P>
<P>Cheerfulne&s;s, with her endearing &s;miles, &s;at enthroned on every countenance. All was joy, harmony, plea&s;antry, jocularity and glee. The adjacent country &s;eemed to
<PB N="162" REF="035084_0161_10014ADFE4409808">
partake of the general &s;atisfaction; the woods, the copices, the gardens, and the en|amelled fields, as if clad in their holiday habiliments, appeared to have been arrayed for the fe&s;tive purpo&s;e, and to have poured forth all their perfume, with their &s;plendid trappings.</P>
<P>The birds, as if intuitively become ac|quainted with the cau&s;e of the grand a&s;&s;em|blage, joined in the general harmony, and from every tree and bough i&s;&s;ued the vocal warblings of feathered choiri&s;ts. To com|plete the &s;cene, the weather kindly contrib|uted; an unclouded &s;ky, a &s;erene temper|ature of air. refre&s;hed by &s;oft breathing ze|phyrs, perfected the ely&s;ium of Dighton Hall.</P>
<P>This is the general account of occurren|ces on that au&s;picious day. I will now en|deavor to be circum&s;tantial. I had the honor to be cla&s;&s;ed among the fir&s;t rank of vi&s;itors, and partook of a mo&s;t elegant and excellent repa&s;t. On this occa&s;ion the gen|tlemen and ladies a&s;&s;ociated; but, &s;hortly after dinner, etiquette &s;eemed to point out that it was expedient for the latter to retire, a proper apartment having been re&s;erved for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The propriety of this &s;tep was tacitly ac|knowleged, hardly a &s;yllable being mention|ed, by any of the gentlemen pre&s;ent, which
<PB N="163" REF="035084_0162_10014AE167015618">
could be con&s;trued to oppo&s;e our departure. A ceremonious &s;eparation took place, and we repaired to the &s;cene which had been provided for us. Our &s;elect &s;i&s;terhood con|&s;i&s;ted of about thirty members, and for our accommodation and entertainment, a &s;mall band of mu&s;ic attended. Madam Mara was the only vocal mercenary; her profe&s;|&s;ional talents were rewarded with that liber|ality which they ju&s;tly merited. Many volunteers, however, inli&s;ted in our vocal corps.</P>
<P>A beautiful young lady, of the name of Harcourt&punc; &s;ung mo&s;t divinely. Nothing could be more enchanting than her voice, except the irre&s;i&s;tible graces which accom|panied it, and the angelic figure which &s;o perfectly accorded with her cele&s;tial harmo|ny. All was &s;upernatural and adorable! &s;he &s;eemed in every re&s;pect, &s;uperior to be|ings merely terre&s;tial: Were &s;he a man, &s;he &s;hould be the god of my idolatry!</P>
<P>After Mi&s;s Harcourt had enraptured ev|ery auditor and beholder, I was &s;olicited to contribute my vocal mite; I pleaded hard to be excu&s;ed&punc; but, perceiving that rudene&s;s only could exculpate me, I reluctantly com|plied with the unanimous wi&s;hes of our fair &s;ociety. But oh! what a falling off! I de|te&s;ted my own weak endeavors to plea&s;e, and condemned my effrontery in pre&s;uming
<PB N="164" REF="035084_0163_10014AE3FA0608D0">
to enter the li&s;ts with a per&s;on &s;o infinitely my &s;uperior. I lamented that I did not &s;ubmit to any cen&s;ures, rather than contra&s;t the croaking of the raven, with the &s;ilver &s;weetne&s;s of the nightingale.</P>
<P>Perhaps, my Belinda, you may be &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the&s;e ob&s;ervations, knowing that I have hitherto entertained no contemptible opinion of my mu&s;ical accompli&s;hments, and thinking, as you have flatteringly a&s;&s;ured me, that my exertions in that line have been more than tolerable. But I now hang down my head aba&s;hed. Mi&s;s Harcourt is "the faire&s;t among the fair."&mdash;She is "angelic among angels!"&mdash;Mediocrity is the utmo&s;t excellence that I can ever hope to arrive at.</P>
<P>Madam Mara, as u&s;ual&punc; gave perfect &s;at|isfaction. Mi&s;s Dighton&punc; &s;i&s;ter to Sir Tho|mas, without much voice, di&s;played great mu&s;ical ta&s;te, and afforded entertainment. Several other ladies were entitled to ap|plau&s;e&punc; for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our little con|cert, and the moments glided away with great rapidity. At length a promenade was propo&s;ed, and agreed to: We repaired to the &s;hrubbery; and, &s;hortly after our ar|rival there. Sir Thomas Dighton, hav|ing obtained leave of ab&s;ence from the gen|tlemen, ha&s;tened to pay his re&s;pects to us.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="035084_0164_10014AE792E41328">With unaffected politene&s;s and affability, he &s;everally addre&s;&s;ed our little coterie, and thanked us for the honor we had conferred on him by our vi&s;it. Some general con|ver&s;ation en&s;ued; after which I was &s;e|lected from the groupe by Sir Thomas, and conducted to a remote corner of the planta|tion.</P>
<P>Without much preamble, Sir Thomas made po&s;itive profe&s;&s;ions of attachment to me; &s;aid he had long been a &s;ilent admirer of my per&s;on and perfections; and had now come to a re&s;olution to &s;olicit my hand in form. Whatever might be the amount of my fortune&punc; he a&s;&s;ured me that he was per|fectly indifferent on that &s;core, having more than an ample independance of his own; but if I would conde&s;cend to be the mi&s;tre&s;s of Dighton Hall, as I was already the &s;ov|reign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of his heart, he &s;hould think him&s;elf the happie&s;t of mankind; if, on the contrary his &s;uit &s;hould be rejected, he &s;hould be one of the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of the human race. He concluded with an earne&s;t wi&s;h, that, if I did not wholly di&s;approve of his addre&s;&s;es, I would give out a ray of hope that there might be a po&s;&s;ibility of his &s;ucceeding, after the u&s;ual a&s;&s;iduities e&s;&s;en|tial in &s;o tender a negociation.</P>
<P>I thanked Sir Thomas for his flattering partiality in my favor, and earne&s;tly be|&s;ought
<PB N="166" REF="035084_0165_10014AEB4F0E1C58">
him to &s;eek for a per&s;on who had a better claim to the title of Lady Dighton; one who&s;e birth and fortune placed her on a footing with him&s;elf. I expatiated on the impropriety of the alliance he propo&s;ed, and begged for his own per&s;onal honor and em|olument, that he would not urge the pro|po&s;al which he had &s;o incon&s;iderately made.</P>
<P>He prote&s;ted that nothing &s;hould divert him from his purpo&s;e, if I would vouch&s;afe to hearken to his petition; but, as I was &s;o injenious in framing objections for him, he feared I was aver&s;e to the overtures he had made.</P>
<P>I repeated my ob&s;ervations with addi|tional energy; but he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution&punc; if he could be favored with the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of being attended to. After many prote&s;tations of inviolate at|tachment&punc; if I would conde&s;cend to h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">arken &s;eriou&s;ly to the dictates of his pa&s;&s;ion. I told him ingenuou&s;ly that I was incapable of at|tending to his tale; that I had not a heart at my di&s;po&s;al; that &s;olemn engagements had been reciprocally made, between me and one whom I preferred to all the world; and that nothing&punc; on my part, &s;hould cancel tho&s;e engagements; that I was &s;en&s;ible of the honor which he intended to confer on me; but though he was truly
<PB N="167" REF="035084_0166_10014AECD196BF20">
amiable and re&s;pectable, and infinitely be|yond what my mo&s;t a&s;piring notions had ever aimed at, yet I was indi&s;pen&s;ibly oblig|ed to di&s;courage addre&s;&s;es which could only feed my vanity, without a po&s;&s;ibility of al|tering a tittle of my &s;acred vow; or to have the lea&s;t bias on my affections.</P>
<P>He heard me with a&s;toni&s;hment and con|cern. He was &s;o greatly agitated, that he frequently attempted to interrupt me; but finding, at length, that I was peremptory in my re&s;olves, and that it would be equally ungenerous and ungenteel to attempt to ar|gue me into a breach of articles, he barely expre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow at the intelligence he received&punc; and, with a &s;igh of re&s;iganation, a|bandoned all pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; declaring that the barriers between him and happine&s;s were in&s;urmountable.</P>
<P>This unexpected overture from a man of rank and fortune, could not but awaken my vanity, and atone&punc; in &s;ome degree, for the mortification I had received in &s;ubmitting to be a foil to Mi&s;s Harcourt. I began to entertain a more exalted opinion of my&s;elf than I had hitherto done; and gave my&s;elf credit for attractions of the &s;uperior kind, without con&s;idering that men are as fre|quently governed by caprice, as by the influ|ence of beauty and accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="035084_0167_10014AEE55709A08">I mu&s;t admit, however, that, though I enjoyed the triumph over Sir Thomas, I felt a pang for the di&s;appointment he had &s;u&s;tained. Though I exulted on my pow|er of inflicting wounds&punc; I had not a wi&s;h that the &s;ufferings and &s;marts which he en|dured &s;hould be too &s;evere. Had I not been engaged, irrevocably engaged, to a man whom I had every rea&s;on to adore, Sir Thomas Dighton's bait would perhaps have been too alluring for me to reject. Let me tell you, my Belinda, a young man ju&s;t twentyone years of age, with an agreeable per&s;on, an immen&s;e fortune, and a title, are no de&s;picable ingredients in the matrimonial <HI>ragout.</HI></P>
<P>This flattering preference in the opinion of Sir Thomas, in the pre&s;ence of many beau|tiful and accompli&s;hed females, made my little heart palpitate with joy. It furni&s;hed me too with an opportunity of convincing Mr. Graham that I was not merely induced by pro&s;pects of advantage to accede to his propo&s;als of matrimony. I &s;hall now take the earlie&s;t opportunity of informing him, that I have refu&s;ed the addre&s;&s;es of Sir Thomas Dighton, infinitely his &s;uperior in point of fortune.</P>
<P>Little did the young baronet expect that he &s;hould meet with a repul&s;e from a per|&s;on of &s;mall fortune, and perhaps &s;maller
<PB N="169" REF="035084_0168_10014AF4C86CD858">
perfections. As &s;oon as he had received the final &s;entence from my lips, he &s;tarted an|other &s;ubject of conver&s;ation; we intermix|ed with the throng, and no particular atten|tion, during the remainder of the day, was be&s;towed by Sir Thomas on your Loui&s;a.</P>
<P>A ball concluded the fe&s;tivity of the day; and it was not till after the arrival of the &s;ucceeding morning, that the well plea&s;ed gue&s;ts could prevail upon them&s;elves to re|tire from the ho&s;pitable man&s;ion.</P>
<P>The length of this letter will &s;ufficiently apologize for my concluding it, without ex|hau&s;ting all my &s;tore of materials, which may be required in my next epi&s;tle.</P>

<P>IN a former letter, my Loui&s;a, I gave you a long account of my reverend &s;wain, and the methods I intended to pur&s;ue to procure a living; but you have been &s;o much engaged on your own affairs, that our little in&s;ignificant advances &s;eem hardly en|titled to your attention.</P>
<P>I hope Sir Thomas Dighton's civilities will neither prevent nor retard the propo&s;ed union between Mr. Graham and my Loui&s;a.

To prevent even a po&s;&s;ibility of wavering, un|der &s;uch tempting circum&s;tances, let me earne&s;tly recommend to you an immediate compliance with Mr. Graham's reque&s;t; ac|company him in&s;tantly to the altar.</P>

There are per&s;ons who, &s;ituated as you are, would cancel the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;everations, and plead the cau&s;e as an ample ju&s;tifica|tion of &s;uch conduct. But I will venture to pronounce that you are not one of tho&s;e per&s;ons, and that, attached as you are by pure affection to Mr. Graham, no allure|ments or advantages can warp your inflexi|ble mind.</P>
<P>Your narrative of the proceedings on Sir Thomas's attaining his majority, entertain|ed me much: Your kindne&s;s in giving it &s;o circum&s;tantially was very flattering to me, as it convinced me that you did not grudge the time devoted to my gratifica|tion.</P>

<P>YOU did me inju&s;tice, Belinda, to &s;uppo&s;e me capable of encouraging the ad|dre&s;&s;es of any man, after the &s;olemn contract between me and Mr. Graham. Believe me, my dear friend, to be &s;eated on a throne I would not deviate in the lea&s;t from my en|gagements with that amiable youth.</P>
<P>Your tender concern on &s;uppo&s;ing me expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t trying temptations, is an additional proof of your e&s;teem for me. I am not therefore di&s;plea&s;ed at your inti|mations of fear and apprehen&s;ion, that I &s;hould be unequal to the ta&s;k which had been impo&s;ed upon me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall dwell no longer on this &s;ubject, having matters of more importance to relate to you. I am obliged to Sir Thomas Digh|ton for the honor he intended me; but pur|&s;uant to your advice. I have put it out of my power to become Lady Dighton.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="035084_0172_10014AFBCE089720">I was entertained, Belinda, with a por|trait you &s;ent me of your clerical &s;wain, in a former letter, before you favored me with your fre&s;h packet, and I admire your great prudence and genero&s;ity, in procuring a living for him. He ought to think him&s;elf a very happy fellow, to find a patron in a lover. I mean not to in&s;inuate that he is a a mere mercenary lover, but certainly a good living is a very de&s;irable acqui&s;ition. Who would not re&s;ign a fellow&s;hip, for a beauti|ful young lady, and a fat benefice?</P>
<P>I admire the genero&s;ity, or rather the gratitude, of your "de&s;erving man." as you emphatically call him, when he makes a voluntary offer of &s;ettling your whole for|tune upon your&s;elf; and your noble and &s;pirited refu&s;al to accept of &s;uch conditions, reflects equal honor on your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Your re&s;olution of de&s;troying the letters, which you may happen to receive from fu|ture corre&s;pondents, I greatly approve.</P>
<P>And now, my Belinda, permit me to ac|quaint you, that I have exchanged the name of Lenox for that of Graham. Ye&s;terday's &s;un &s;aw me, with &s;acred &s;olemnity, initiated into the my&s;teries of matrimony. The cer|emony was attended by the mo&s;t re&s;pecta|ble nobility and gentry in the neighborhood, and a &s;mile of &s;atisfaction appeared on eve|ry face.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="035084_0173_10014B04D80D8820">The hu&s;bandman for&s;ook his field, and the &s;hepherd his flock, to join in the fe&s;tivi|ty of the day, and mix in the proce&s;&s;ion.&mdash; Mr. Graham is the idol of all who know him, from the nobleman to the humble cot|tager: undi&s;&s;embled joy was therefore te&s;ti|fied, by every means that could be contriv|ed, on that au&s;picious day, which united me to the be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>On our return from the altar, we partook of &s;ome refre&s;hment at Mr. Graham's hou&s;e; and&punc; after taking and airing, came back to a &s;umptuous dinner, provided, upon the occa&s;ion, for the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of our friends. Another exten&s;ive table was &s;pread in the great hall, for tho&s;e of le&s;s opulence, and who moved in an humbler &s;phere; and a third for the pea&s;antry, and others. Bar|rels of beer, and plenty of all kinds of pro|vi&s;ion, were al&s;o di&s;tributed to the populace without doors.</P>
<P>In the evening we had a ball, which was compo&s;ed of the fir&s;t characters in this part of the kingdom, and was remarkably &s;plen|did.</P>
<P>Congratulate me, my dear Belinda, on this tran&s;cendantly joyful occa&s;ion; for, believe me, I am the happie&s;t of my &s;ex!</P>
<P>My &s;ituation, in all re&s;pects, is realy en|viable; the hou&s;e or which I am now legal|ly con&s;tituted the mi&s;tre&s;s, is an antique but
<PB N="175" REF="035084_0174_10014B065A15CBA0">
elegant building, and is &s;ituated in a pad|dock, at a proper di&s;tance from the road.&mdash; Many of the rooms are &s;pacious, and fur|ni&s;hed in the modern ta&s;te; the others are neat, &s;imple and convenient; the decora|tions le&s;s &s;plendid, though equally plea&s;ing. A plea&s;ure garden of about three acres lies behind the man&s;ion, and is laid out with in|finite elegance and judgment. It abounds with variety of the choice&s;t &s;hrubs, fruit|trees and flowers, among which are many curious exotics.</P>
<P>Here, in the &s;weet &s;ociety of my dear and amiable companion, the hours glide happily away. Like another Eden, our garden ap|pears a paradi&s;e to us, whence there is no danger of being driven, as we touch not the forbidden fruit.</P>
<P>A Summerhou&s;e, beautifully con&s;tructed, embelli&s;hes one corner of the garden; whith|er we can repair when &s;ultry Phoebus is too powerful, or when a &s;hower of rain renders &s;uch retirement nece&s;&s;ary. The murmuring of a little rivulet which meanders near this little &s;tructure, has a plea&s;ing effect, e&s;pe|cially in hot weather.</P>
<P>An orchard, now rich with autumnal fruit, joins to our plea&s;ure garden. It is plea&s;ing to the view, and promi&s;es to furni&s;h our table with a luxurious de&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="035084_0175_10014B07DDC1C858">Sometimes, to vary the &s;cene, I accom|pany Mr. Graham in his phaeton (the only carriage he at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es) to take the air, and occa&s;ionally to vi&s;it &s;ome ho&s;pita|ble and friendly neighbor.</P>
<P>Not above half a mile from our re&s;idence a tran&s;parent river runs through the verdant meadows. This &s;tream is often vi&s;ited by the ladies and gentlemen in our vicinity, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of angling.&mdash;I have been many times prevailed on to be one of the party upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, but I cannot deem that a diver&s;ion, which inflicts death or torture on any animal, however in&s;ig|nificant it may appear to us of the human race.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t more innocent amu&s;ements are to be found, I &s;hall not in future be ea&s;ily pre|vailed on to join fi&s;hing parties. But, as I would not affect to be over delicate, I &s;hall decline &s;uch engagements, by making any apology that may occur to me.</P>
<P>Indeed, Belinda, home has &s;o many charms for me, that I &s;eldom am induced to quit it. If I have the company of my good man, I have not a wi&s;h beyond it; he is all the world to me!</P>
<P>Mr. Graham's &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e perfections I have already mentioned to you, &s;hews ev|ery attention to me in her power; &s;he is &s;o capital in the mu&s;ical line, that I have &s;o|licited
<PB N="177" REF="035084_0176_10014B0BF661C0C0">
her to become her pupil. She po|litely thanked me for the horor I propo&s;ed to confer on her, and gladly took me under her tutorage. For the &s;hort time that I have applied my&s;elf to the &s;tudy of that plea&s;ing &s;cience, &s;he flatters me with having made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s. I hope I &s;hall in time, become a proficient, as I would joyfully embrace every opportunity of ren|dering my&s;elf more worthy of Mr. Gra|ham.</P>
<P>My mu&s;ical tutore&s;s &s;ometimes accom|panies her brother and my&s;elf in a rural <HI>promenade</HI> about the hamlet. In the&s;e lim|ited excur&s;ions we are &s;aluted with the clum&s;y bows and courte&s;ies of the inhabit|ants, who frequently receive &s;mall bounties from us, in return for which we have their fervent prayers, articulated in homely but in heartfelt accents.</P>
<P>Such an hone&s;t &s;implicity of manners prevails among our pea&s;antry, &s;o much in|nocence appears in all their little plea&s;ures and pur&s;uits, as to convey an idea of the harmle&s;s &s;hepherds on the Arcadian plains, &s;o much celebrated by our pa&s;toral po|ets.</P>
<P>A theft or robbery is hardly ever heard of among us. Contented with the &s;canty but whole&s;ome food which their own in|du&s;try &s;upplies, they never think of invad|ing
<PB N="178" REF="035084_0177_10014B0EE4384720">
the property of others. We might e|ven &s;leep in &s;ecurity with our doors wide open.</P>
<P>How different is this, my Belinda, from the &s;tate of rapine which reigns in the me|tropolis! Where vice not only lurks in ob|&s;cure corners, but &s;talks forth in open day|light, and danger is to be apprehended in your public &s;treets, Even the utmo&s;t vigi|lance of the police cannot protect you from the depredations of the robber and the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P>Suffer me to prevail on you to vi&s;it the&s;e happy regions. You have my earne&s;t in|vitation to make your abode here, as long as you may find it agreeable; and Mr. Gra|ham, on his part, will exert him&s;elf to hin|der your departure.</P>
<P>But&punc; &s;hould you be&s;tow your hand upon Mr. Proby, which appears to me more than probable, I fear you will not be able to comply with my reque&s;t, as his re&s;idence will perhaps be required on the living, to which he is to be pre&s;ented. Of that you will inform me hereafter.</P>
<P>You a&s;k my opinion on the propo&s;ed match between you and the reverend youth whom you &s;o much e&s;teem. My opinion will certainly be acceptable, becau&s;e it cor|re&s;ponds entirely with your own. Wed him without unnece&s;&s;ary delay! If he is as

worthy as you repre&s;ent him (and I never had any rea&s;on to doubt of your veracity) be careful not to lo&s;e him. He is a man worth any woman, and his equal may not ea&s;ily be found.</P>
<P>I wait impatiently for your letter of con|gratulation on my becoming a bride. I know you will rejoice at my happine&s;s; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, if there is a po&s;&s;ibility of rendering it more complete, the joy|ful tidings of your being happily united with the man you love, alone can do it.</P>
<P>Permit me, my Belinda, to affirm, that you will ever have the &s;econd place in my e&s;teem, which is all that can be rea&s;onably expected from</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. <HI>BELINDA BLACKET,</HI> to <HI>LOUISA LENOX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HEARTILY congratulate you, my Loui&s;a, on the celebration of your nuptials May your happine&s;s be proportioned to your de&s;erts! Cele&s;tial joys would then a|wait you! You would be beyond the reach of tho&s;e &s;orrows and di&s;appointments which u&s;ually embitter the cup of life! &s;erving as alloy to tho&s;e plea&s;ures which mu&s;t not be permitted to exceed the terre&s;trial &s;tand|ard.</P>
<P>Again mu&s;t I entreat your pardon for &s;uppo&s;ing there was a po&s;&s;ibility of your breaking your faith with Mr. Graham; but for tho&s;e we e&s;teem our fears are alarmed on the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant occurences; the mo&s;t di&s;tant danger gives birth to anxie|ties; and we cen&s;ure the gentle breeze, le&s;t it &s;hould inflict a cold on the object of our attention.</P>
<P>Frequently, my Loui&s;a, have you enjoin|ed me to furni&s;h you with intelligence from
<PB N="181" REF="035084_0180_10014B17999560A0">
the metropolis, the &s;ource of adventure and intelligence; and I have always endeavor|ed to oblige you, as far as the limits of a &s;heet of paper would allow me. A my&s;te|rious affair has lately given ri&s;e to much conjecture, and &s;ome altercation; but the my&s;tery begins to be unravelled, and the doubts &s;eem to be &s;uper&s;eded by &s;tubborn facts.</P>
<P>A young lady, beautiful, nobly allied, and only in her twenty&s;econd year, thought her&s;elf neglected by the youths of quality of the other &s;ex, and therefore, if &s;he could not have the &s;atisfaction of procuring an actual wooer, &s;he was determined at lea&s;t to enjoy the reputation of being wooed: She therefore conjured up a man of quality, no le&s;s than the heir apparent of a pui&s;&s;ant duke. To give the appearance of reality to the imaginary court&s;hip, &s;he did not con|fine her&s;elf to the bare method of commun|icating the plea&s;ing tidings by the lips; &s;he produced letters, not only from the &s;uppo&s;|ed enamored &s;wain, but even from the head of the mo&s;t noble hou&s;e. Corroborative e|pi&s;tles were al&s;o circulated in variety of forms and places; in&s;omuch that the tale was almo&s;t univer&s;ally believed, and a &s;peedy union was expected to have taken place between the young nobleman, who was utterly a &s;tranger to the affair, and the
<PB N="182" REF="035084_0181_10014B1AD1775810">
young lady who planned and projected the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, and wanted to pa&s;s upon the world for a marchione&s;s elect.</P>
<P>Happy, no doubt, at being thought the enviable object of an amiable young noble|man's addre&s;&s;es, &s;he produced many docu|ments to keep afloat the &s;tory which &s;he had circulated; well knowing that as &s;oon as the eclairci&s;&s;ement took place her triumph would be at an end.</P>
<P>At length, however, the narrative pa&s;&s;ed through &s;o many channels of communica|tion, that it found its way to the ears of tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the parties. Wholly unacquainted with every &s;yllable that had been related to them, and the im|aginary ri&s;e and progre&s;s of an hymeneal treaty, they naturally expre&s;&s;ed their a&s;ton|i&s;hment at the ingenuity of the fabricator.</P>
<P>A di&s;covery was now made that all the reports, epi&s;tles, billets, &amp;c. had been fab|ricated. The marriage articles which had been &s;igned, the jewels, and the bridal hab|iliments, were found to have been only in the epi&s;tles circulated by the young lady; and all her ideal rank and con&s;equence van|i&s;hed in&s;tantly into air.</P>
<P>Though the fair adventure&s;s knew that it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to e&s;cape detection in the end, &s;he flattered her&s;elf with being &s;omewhat longer in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this ideal
<PB N="183" REF="035084_0182_1001491ED63205A8">
happine&s;s and &s;plendor; but, as a develope|ment was manife&s;t, &s;he, with infinite addre&s;s, endeavored to make it appear that &s;he had been impo&s;ed on as well as the noble lord; and for a time the public opinion was in equipoi&s;e whether &s;he was the impo&s;er, or the object of impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The young lady had many advocates, who endeavored to affix the odium, due to the fabricator of the &s;tory, on another quarter. But the charge of delinquency is now gen|erally directed to the heroine of the ro|mance, and &s;he will find it no ea&s;y ta&s;k to get acquitted of the offence for which &s;he is now arraigned before the public.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it may hereafter appear that &s;he is perfectly innocent; or, if not, that &s;he &s;hould not incur the dete&s;tation of the world, for the exerci&s;es of a &s;pecies of folly which could not be injurious to any one. A beau|tiful young woman wi&s;hes to be noticed; &s;he thinks her&s;elf fully entitled to the atten|tions, and almo&s;t to the adorations of young men; &s;he thinks &s;he has &s;o good a claim to their a&s;&s;iduities, that if they neglect their duty, it is but doing ju&s;tice to her charms to create ideal lovers; that &s;he may at lea&s;t appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s what &s;he has an indubitable claim to.</P>
<P>Perhaps, my Loui&s;a, I may not be perfect|ly orthodox in the creed of love; but I hope
<PB N="184" REF="035084_0183_10014B1C5450BEA0">
you will admit there is no great impropriety in the argument I have ventured to advance in this bu&s;ine&s;s. It would afford me infi|nite plea&s;ure if the young nobleman, whom the lady thought proper to be in love with, and to make the affection reciprocal, would actually realize the tale, and readily conduct her to the altar. He mu&s;t be convinced that &s;he has a regard for him, or &s;he would not have &s;elected him for her hero.</P>
<P>I have been thus particular in my little narrative, becau&s;e it is now the general topic of conver&s;ation among the great and little world in our exten&s;ive capital.</P>
<P>Though in a former letter I mention my re&s;olution of de&s;troying any future billets that might be addre&s;&s;ed to me, I have taken the liberty of re&s;erving a few of them, but they are not very remarkable for their bril|liancy. The contents of &s;ome of them, however, may probably amu&s;e you. I have tran&s;cribed a few of the be&s;t of them, and hereby faithfully promi&s;e you&punc; never more to trouble you with the effu&s;ions of any more of my new&s;paper lovers; they are lit|erally as follow.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVIII. <HI>HARRY HOUNSLOW,</HI> to <HI>BELINDA BLACKET.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SAW your adverti&s;ement in the World, but bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome importance put it out of my power to pay the attention to it that it merited. To tell you the real truth Madam, I was taken that very day into the hands of the officers of police. Some accu&s;ations were made again&s;t me in Bow &s;treet; and though the charges were not fully &s;ub&s;tanciated, I was ordered into confinement.</P>
<P>Pri&s;oners of war are &s;ometimes &s;uffered to be at large on their parol, but gentlemen of the road are not thought entitled to &s;uch indulgences. I hope, Madam, you will think I have made a &s;ufficient apology for not &s;ooner endeavoring to find you out, and throwing my&s;elf at your feet.</P>
<P>My bu&s;ine&s;s, Madam, is honorable, but angerous; the late extravagant improve|ments,
<PB N="186" REF="035084_0185_10014B23655DC7D8">
particularly in the environs of the metropolis are very di&s;advantageous to per|&s;ons of our calling. Formerly a gentleman might collect a few pur&s;es on the road, and the danger of detection was &s;o incon&s;idera|ble as not to demand a &s;erious reflection; but now &s;o many &s;nares are laid for us, &s;o many illuminations are exhibited, and &s;o many bloodhounds are in pur&s;uit of us, that I have almo&s;t come to a re&s;olution of relin|qui&s;hing my pre&s;ent trade, and engaging in &s;omething that may be le&s;s lucrative, but may not be attended with any fatal con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>Mercy, my dear Madam, is an attribute fit for the gods, and, as the divine Shake|&s;peare affiruis, ble&s;&s;es both the giver and re|ceiver. If you would deign to have mercy upon me Madam, you might relieve me from the crimes and con&s;equences of depre|dation, pre&s;erve me from a premature and ignominious death, and by a life of purity and integrity render me a fit candidate for the realms of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s above.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Madam, this may appear to you as a very &s;ingular mode of court&s;hip. I am indeed of the &s;ame opinion; but as I have pointed out a plan by which you may be|come entitled to everla&s;ting happine&s;s, I ought to claim a little of your attention. To &s;ave a life would afford con&s;olation to a
<PB N="187" REF="035084_0186_10014B26603DDC48">
humane brea&s;t; to &s;ave a &s;oul would glad|den that brea&s;t exceedingly; but how infi|nite would be the future rewards for &s;uch exemplary pious actions!</P>
<P>I was bred and educated as a gentleman, Madam; from my infancy I was taught to believe and expect, that when I approached the &s;tate of manhood, I &s;hould have been furni&s;hed with a liberal provi&s;ion for my &s;upport, in a mode of life to which I had been accu&s;tomed; but before that period arrived, death deprived me of both my pa|rents, and my father, with his la&s;t breath, lamented he had nothing to leave me, hav|ing broke into the la&s;t hundred of his ca&s;h, and his acres and hou&s;es had been long di&s;|po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>Entertaining an affectionate e&s;teem for my father, I felt the lo&s;s of him as a very great calamity; but lo&s;ing with him all expecta|tions of an independency, my &s;ituation was indeed deplorable. In a word, I was pre&s;|ently made acquainted with my real &s;itua|tion, and that the author of my being, &s;en&s;i|ble that he had con&s;umed a patrimony which was to have been tran&s;mitted to his po&s;teri|ty, literally broke his heart.</P>
<P>Trained to no bu&s;ine&s;s, employment, or occupation, to what could I apply my&s;elf to procure a maintenance? Drudgery or hard labor I could not prevail on my&s;elf to
<PB N="188" REF="035084_0187_10014924370D3748">
&s;ubmit to, or to appear in any &s;ituation which might be thought degrading to a gen|tleman. Though educated at an univer&s;ity, I had been too indolent to be&s;tow clo&s;e at|tention to the &s;ciences, and therefore only acquired a little &s;mattering in them; a little &s;uperficial knowledge which it would be di&s;graceful for a gentleman to be without.</P>
<P>De&s;titute of money, re&s;ources, or expect|ations, I was not long in forming a re&s;olu|tion to enli&s;t my&s;elf among the cavalry. My credit was not &s;o much impaired by my misfortunes, but I &s;till found I could be en|tru&s;ted with a hor&s;e. A pi&s;tol, and &s;ome other implements, adapted to the profe&s;&s;ion in which I was about to engage, were &s;oon procured.</P>
<P>Thus, determined to procure a precarious &s;upport, by borrowing a little from the afflu|ent, purely to pre&s;erve exi&s;tence, I &s;et out with great compo&s;ure in pur&s;uit of my daily bread.</P>
<P>I re&s;olved however, before I entered up|on my new calling, never to exerci&s;e the lea&s;t cruelty, or to make u&s;e of &s;uch menacing language as might create terror in the per|&s;ons on whom I might make a demand. This re&s;olution I was determined invariably to abide by, whatever might be the con&s;e|quences. In a lane, leading from Harrow to the Uxbridge road, I made my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay; I overtook an old gentleman on hor&s;eback.
<PB N="189" REF="035084_0188_100149276D8CB4A0">
and my &s;alutation was an ob&s;ervation on the weather. "'Tis a fine day, &s;ir," &s;aid I. "Very fine, indeed," replied the gentleman, of whom I meant to borrow a few pieces.</P>
<P>I told him that di&s;tre&s;s had induced me to undertake a new bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore if I did not acquit my&s;elf with &s;o much adroitne&s;s as one who had been longer in practice, I hoped he would make a proper allowance for my inexperience.</P>
<P>The traveller &s;eemed alarmed, but did not perfectly comprehend my meaning. I therefore entreated him to furni&s;h me in|&s;tantly with what ca&s;h he could &s;pare, and I would gladly repay him if fortune &s;hould ever put it in my power. I further inform|ed him that any unnece&s;&s;ary delay, on his part, would oblige me to produce a &s;hining a&s;&s;i&s;tant from my pocket, which would en|force obedience to my reque&s;t: I hoped, however, that I &s;hould not be compelled to act uncivilly; but that depended on his readine&s;s to admini&s;ter to my nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hed yeoman (for &s;o I &s;uppo&s;ed him to be) could no longer mi&s;under&s;tand the drift of my bu&s;ine&s;s, and with the ut|mo&s;t expedition delivered me his pur&s;e; in which, on examination, I found the &s;um of &s;even guineas and an half. After politely taking leave of my benefactor, and thanking him for his &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply, we &s;eparated&punc;
<PB N="190" REF="035084_0189_10000A18247E1E08">
the gentleman proceeded on his journey, and I thought it prudent to take a contrary cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed with the encouragement I had met with on my fir&s;t attempt, I began to be a little reconciled to my new calling, and meant to return immediately to the cap|ital; having, as I thought, a &s;ufficient quan|tity of ca&s;h to &s;upport me for &s;everal weeks, and not intending to take the road again till nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould compel me &s;o to do. I did not become a plunderer to enable me to launch into extravagancies and follies, but to procure a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and to keep me literally from &s;tarving.</P>
<P>But while my mind was occupied with the&s;e reflections, riding at my ea&s;e without apprehen&s;ions of danger, I heard the &s;ound of the feet of hor&s;es coming furiou&s;ly be|hind me; gue&s;&s;ing their bu&s;ine&s;s with me, I &s;et off full &s;peed, and we had an excellent race for about a mile and an half. At length I was overtaken, and I recognized among my pur&s;uers, the gentleman of whom I had borrowed the yellow &s;hiners.</P>
<P>Luckily for me, I had thrown away the pur&s;e; and though the booty I had taken was found upon me, pieces of coin cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;worn to, unle&s;s they have been previou&s;ly marked. I had al&s;o put on a wig over my hair, which I had carried in
<PB N="191" REF="035084_0190_10000A1E2E84CC58">
my pocket for that purpo&s;e. This made &s;o great an alteration in my figure, that my accu&s;er could not po&s;itively &s;wear to the identity of my per&s;on, but &s;aid he believed I was the man who had robbed him of his pur&s;e and money.</P>
<P>I was conducted to a place of &s;afety, and the next day exhibited at a public office; where many per&s;ons appeared who had ex|perienced recent depredations. After having been minutely &s;urveyed by every one pre&s;|ent, none of whom could charge me with any offence, I pa&s;&s;ed an examination before a magi&s;trate, and, &s;u&s;picions being very &s;trong again&s;t me, was committed to a man|&s;ion of &s;ecurity, that I might receive the judgment of my peers at the approaching &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the tribunal of <HI>Oyer et terminer</HI> I ap|peared, was arraigned, tried, acquitted, and di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Being now perfectly at liberty, madam, I &s;hould be happy to receive your commands. If you will permit me to attend you, I flat|ter my&s;elf you will not think contemptuou&s;|ly of me.

<P>YOUR letter, my Belinda, inclo&s;ing three of tho&s;e which you have lately receiv|ed from your curious corre&s;pondents, &s;uffi|ciently demon&s;trates that you do not con|&s;ider any thing as labor, which you under|take to gratify my curio&s;ity, or afford me information or amu&s;ement.

<P>ACCEPT my congratulations, mo&s;t amia|ble Loui&s;a, on the celebration of your nuptials! may you, and the fortunate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of your hand and heart, be as happy as you de&s;erve

to be!&mdash;Your recital of the particulars on the fe&s;tive day of marriage, delighted me exceedingly&mdash;it conveys a plea&s;ing idea of northern ho&s;pitality, and of the gratitude of individuals, in te&s;tifying their joy for the happine&s;s of their benefactor.</P>
<P>You de&s;cribe, with elegance and preci&s;ion, the family man&s;ion, and its agreeable ap|purtenances.</P>
<P>Your ob&s;ervations on the diver&s;ion of angling, are &s;uch as I &s;hould have expected from my Loui&s;a. They do you honor, and are an additional proof that mercy and ten|derne&s;s, &s;o amiable in a female character, inhabit your benevolent bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Your rea&s;on for becoming a pupil to your &s;i&s;ter in law, does you infinite credit; and your comparative view of the Northern and Middle&s;ex inhabitants, is too ju&s;t to be que&s;|tioned or contradicted.</P>
<P>I thank you for your obliging invitation to your agreeable man&s;ion; but whether I can accept of it, depends wholly upon cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I have followed your example, my Loui|&s;a, and am, like you, become a wife. My hand was given la&s;t monday to Mr. Proby; my heart was his long before. Our nuptials were &s;olemnized at St. James's church, and celebrated at the Star&punc; and Garter in Rich|mond; but not with that &s;plendor and pa|rade
<PB N="199" REF="035084_0198_10000A354C1D1EB8">
which was exhibited on your bridal day.</P>
<P>My uncle, and a few &s;elect friends of both &s;exes, a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the ceremony, and pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the day with us, with that cheerfulne&s;s and &s;atisfaction, u&s;ually attend|ant upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Believe me, my Loui&s;a, my happine&s;s is now complete, for I enjoy the full fruition of all my wi&s;hes. Mr. Proby is every thing that is amiable, and my uncle has been lib|eral beyond my expectations.</P>
<P>A few days prior to our marriage, a long conte&s;ted &s;uit in chancery was determined, in which my worthy man was one of the parties. A decree was made in his favor, which gives him an e&s;tate of fifteen hundred pounds a year, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable &s;um in the con|&s;olidated annuities. This cau&s;e has been long pending, the per&s;on who had u&s;urped the e&s;tate, having taken every mea&s;ure of delay which the court of chancery would permit.</P>
<P>Added to this, my own fortune is five hundred pounds a year real e&s;tate, and ten thou&s;and pounds in ca&s;h; exclu&s;ive of a bank note, of a thou&s;and pounds value, pre|&s;ented to me by my uncle, on my wedding day; who has al&s;o cau&s;ed Mr. Proby to be inducted to a valuable living.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="035084_0199_10000ACB20165EE8">Thus &s;ituated, my Loui&s;a, every thing that is de&s;irable is within my reach. Wed|ded to the be&s;t of men, who&s;e fortune unit|ed with my own, readers us independent and even affluent, we may adopt any mode of living con&s;i&s;tent with our annual income.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Proby knew of the decree in his favor on the day it was given, he did not communicate that intelligence to me till af|ter dinner on our wedding day. The news was therefore doubly welcome to me; in the fir&s;t place, it mu&s;t have proved to my good man, that I did not marry him on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ore of fortune; and in the next, I was plea&s;ed at &s;o &s;udden an unexpected an acce&s;&s;ion of property.</P>
<P>You and I, my Loui&s;a, owe our obliga|tions to the fates&mdash;never were two friends more equally attended to by the blind god|de&s;s, than we are!&mdash;dare you pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that our merits' have a claim to &s;uch di&s;tinction?&mdash;for my own part, I candidly acknowledge that the project I engaged in, was a ridiculous one, however fortunate the event.</P>
<P>It was &s;olely owing to the caprice of the blind deity that I have been &s;ucce&s;sful; but you, my Loui&s;a, have &s;ufficient merit to en|title you to her be&s;t gifts, without creating even a &s;u&s;picion of partiality.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="035084_0200_10000A37E74A1718">I am now like a turtle lamenting the lo&s;s of my mate. Mr. Proby has been ab&s;ent from me the&s;e three days; his attendance being required in Northampton&s;hire, on &s;ome material bu&s;ine&s;s relative to the living he is &s;hortly to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after his return, we have fixed upon a We&s;tern tour, but our headquarters are to be at Bath; where we expect to pa&s;s our time very agreeably; afterwards we &s;hall revi&s;it the capital, and endeavor to learn from &s;ome of the public prints, whether any tolerable hand&s;ome man&s;ion is to be &s;old, which, (if we can find one to our ta&s;te) we mean to purcha&s;e for a &s;ummer re&s;idence. We would not wi&s;h to have it more than fifteen miles from London, nor, le&s;s than ten or eleven.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not be &s;urprized, Loui&s;a, if we &s;hould accept of your obliging invitation, and pa&s;s the next &s;ummer with you in the North. The &s;uppo&s;ed impediment, which you mentioned in your la&s;t, cannot hinder Mr. Proby from accompanying me on &s;uch a vi&s;it; for, having a chaplain's &s;carf, his re&s;idence on his living may be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>You draw &s;o delightful a picture of your village and its inhabitants, that I &s;hould be anxious to behold &s;o enchanting a &s;pot, even if my Loui&s;a was not there; but, &s;uch a

magnet as you, mu&s;t at all times, mo&s;t pow|erfully attract me. Suffer me, however, to propo&s;e conditions upon this occa&s;ion, which I &s;hall rigidly expect to be complied with on your part, that if I pay a vi&s;it to my Loui&s;a in the north, &s;he mu&s;t accompany her Belinda on her return to the &s;outh; where, during the inclemency of winter, populous cities are not without their charms. In that dreary &s;ea&s;on, the country has lo&s;t the power of plea&s;ing; grown cheerle&s;s by the long ab&s;ence of the enlivening &s;un, life cannot be enjoyed in the northern regions, though it may be endured; the trees, &s;trip|ped of their foilage, pre&s;ent a melancholly pro&s;pect; the birds no longer delight the ear with their harmonious notes; the earth cea&s;es to teem with her rich produce and be|comes &s;teril; and the face of it often cover|ed with a mantle of &s;now. The purling &s;teams are arre&s;ted and &s;ilenced by the chil|ling influence of the fro&s;t, and all nature &s;eems an univer&s;al blank.</P>
<P>On the annual return of the&s;e gloomy and unplea&s;ant pro&s;pects, my Loui&s;a would do well to quit the joyle&s;s &s;cene, and direct her &s;teps towards the capital; there a kind of artificial &s;ummer is ever to be found, and mirth and fe&s;tivity cha&s;e away the thoughts of unpropitious winter, with all her haggard train. Deign thereof to make

Happy &s;hall we be in re|ciprocally communicating our joys, and in expatiating on the virtues of our good men, who have rai&s;ed us to an enviable &s;tate of uninterrupted happine&s;s.</P>
