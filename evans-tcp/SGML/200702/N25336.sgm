CYNTHIA. A NOVEL.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="part of story">
<P>FORTH from a de&s;ert and un|frequented wood in the ea&s;t parts of Albion, a|butting to the &s;ea, i&s;&s;ued out a woman; and &s;eat|ed her&s;elf upon a carpet of &s;weet flowers, em|broidered by the hand of nature; &s;he re&s;embled Diana, the beautiful huntre&s;s of the woods; or more fair, if po&s;&s;ible: one would have taken her for a cele&s;tial deity, if the &s;ucceeding vici&s;|&s;itudes of fortune had not &s;trongly per&s;uaded &s;he was a mortal beauty. Indeed the purity of her complexion &s;eemed to excel the new fallen &s;now, but &s;orrow gathered the carnation off her cheeks. All the features of her face had &s;o near a kindred, and formed to &s;o rare a proportion, that &s;he &s;eemed nature's ma&s;ter|piece; or rather &s;ympathi&s;ed &s;omething of that divinity which name &s;he bore. From her eyes darted a lu&s;tre, mingled with a vivacity &s;o pen|etrating, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t confident &s;oul to make re&s;i&s;tance. This pro|digious creature, after, &s;he had &s;earched every vacant place with her eye, fearing to be over|heard,
<PB N="4" REF="033593_0003_0FF7972D34C045C0">
with a troubled and low voice &s;he began as followeth:</P>
<P>"O my dear, though ab&s;ent, Or&s;amus! To who&s;e merits I never yet gave any reward, who&s;e complaints I could never be induced to pity! When Neptune &s;hipwrecked thee upon the &s;hore, I little thought thy pre&s;ence would beget me &s;uch di&s;quiet; O duty! O love! To what extremes do you hurry me? And what enemies are you to my re&s;t? The birds that live in the&s;e unfrequented woods are happier than I; for they may chu&s;e their mates, and carol their &s;weet plea&s;ures to the &s;pring; but by the cruel commands of a father I am forced to neglect the per&s;on I love; and di&s;e&s;teem the &s;ervices of one with di&s;dain, who&s;e welfare I prize above my life; who once left, I would not bid a welcome to the deare&s;t good the world can afford me. But alas! The time draws near that will make a perpetual divorce. Unfortunate Or&s;amus, by thy ab&s;ence; mi&s;er|able Cynthia, by thy folly."</P>
<P>Scarce had the&s;e words took a farewel from her mouth, when from an adjacent part of the wood i&s;&s;ued out a man richly appareled, and bent his &s;teps directly to the place where &s;he &s;at. Her eyes had no &s;ooner found him out, but with exce&s;s of grief &s;he uttered the&s;e com|plaints, "O cruel Heavens! Do you take a plea&s;ure in tormenting &s;ubmitting innocence,
<PB N="5" REF="033593_0004_0FF7972ECB7983E8">
that you conduct this mon&s;ter, the enemy of my content, and fatal di&s;turber of my quiet, &s;o unfortunately to the place of my concealment; now farewel my poor Or&s;amus; I &s;hall only &s;tay here among&s;t the living to con&s;ecrate the relicts of a langui&s;hing life to thy dear mem|ory."</P>
<P>By this time the unknown per&s;on came up; and &s;eating him&s;elf by her &s;ide, he acco&s;ted her with this di&s;cour&s;e: "Madam, &s;aid he, your father expects you with ardency, and is in fear|ful apprehen&s;ions of the certainty of your &s;afe|ty. Why, madam, continued he, at &s;uch a time as this do you &s;eek out &s;olitude, and &s;o carefully &s;hun the per&s;on that adores you? Why the&s;e clouds my dear prince&s;s, on a joyful day; wherefore the&s;e tears too, too precious to be thus lavi&s;hly ca&s;t away; Why are my promi&s;ing joys overca&s;t with &s;uch fearful o|mens, and my &s;weete&s;t hopes vani&s;hed? Tell me, O tell me! joy of my bli&s;s, what may oc|ca&s;ion your di&s;quiet, that with the peril of my life I may procure a remedy."</P>
<P>This fair unknown was preparing, for a re|ply, when they were di&s;turbed with a noi&s;e from the neighbouring thickets; and ca&s;ting their eyes about to under&s;tand the cau&s;e of that &s;urprizal, when behold there ru&s;hed out a man, who&s;e unexpected appearance was quickly be|come their a&s;toni&s;hment: his vi&s;age was pale
<PB N="6" REF="033593_0005_0FF79730655E19E0">
and clouded over with grief; in all regards and lineaments of his face appeared a natural fiercene&s;s; his whole compo&s;ure &s;hewed the ev|idence of &s;omething &s;o great and noble that &s;pake him to command others, born to di&s;e&s;|teem the whole world, and think it held none fit to be his rival.</P>
<P>He &s;et his face and directed his ha&s;ty &s;teps to the place where they &s;at; but his pre&s;ence put them both in confu&s;ion. He no &s;ooner pre&s;ented him&s;elf to their &s;ight, but fixing his eyes wholly on this fair unknown, as the load &s;tone of his will, and centre of his happine&s;s, with a rapture of joy he &s;uddenly ca&s;t him&s;elf at her feet. "O my divine prince&s;s, &s;aid he, beautiful cau&s;e of my misfortunes, and cruel origin of all my mi&s;eries? How careful has fortune been to make me happy, when I have intended to &s;acrifice the fragment of this wretch|ed life to your &s;everity? I have yet this com|fort left me in death, to complain to you of your inju&s;tice."</P>
<P>All this time a wavering colour often went and came in her cheeks, that &s;he became &s;tiff|ned with a&s;toni&s;hment, as if &s;he had been planet &s;truck; but at la&s;t calling back that a&s;&s;urance her &s;udden &s;urprizal had &s;eque&s;tered, "Gods, &s;aid &s;he, is this Or&s;amus him&s;elf I &s;ee before me? Yes, replied he; it is Or&s;amus, if you have not ca&s;t the memory of &s;o poor a wretch
<PB N="7" REF="033593_0006_0FF79732DA803DA0">
into oblivion." This &s;aid, he di&s;&s;embled him|&s;elf from her knees, and with a look full of ter|ror, he drew his &s;word to pierce his brea&s;t with that fatal weapon. But Cynthia no &s;ooner &s;aw that glittering mini&s;ter of death un&s;heathed, but giving a grievious &s;hriek, &s;he fell into a deadly &s;woon; when &s;uddenly ca&s;ting his eyes about, he &s;aw this fir&s;t gallant &s;itting like one metamorpho&s;ed, or a &s;tatue without life; and &s;uddenly calling him to remembrance, "Oh (cried he) have I found you, the only oppo&s;er of my bli&s;s? Can you think to go &s;afely away with that prize, which is only due to my &s;er|vices; If you know how to own a good, main|tain the intere&s;t you would challenge in this di|vine creature with your &s;word." Saying this, he pre&s;ented his &s;word again&s;t his brea&s;t, but he never moved from the place where he &s;at, neither did he endeavour to make any motion of defence.</P>
<P>In this interim of time, his friends who had been in que&s;t of him in the mo&s;t &s;ecret parts of the wood, hearing of a di&s;turbance, came up unto him, and &s;eeing Cordello in danger, at that moment they made in, and re&s;cued him out of his hands, when no doubt he had acted the la&s;t cata&s;trophe and &s;cene of his life. They all a&s;&s;aulted him at once; but he, without &s;pending a thought upon the number, ru&s;hed upon them like lightning, with a &s;wiftne&s;s,
<PB N="8" REF="033593_0007_0FF7973643A7E1F0">
and looks &s;o terrible and dreadful, that he made the forwarde&s;t repent their ra&s;hne&s;s. Six lay &s;tain by his hands: and they had encom|pa&s;&s;ed him about, &s;o that it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible he could make any longer re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t &s;uch numbers as &s;urrounded him.</P>
<P>When lo! fortune provided a remedy for this di&s;a&s;ter; yet one that &s;eemed wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. Behold from an adjoining creek of the &s;ea, &s;haded by a little hill, i&s;&s;ued about &s;ixteen pirates led on by their captain. They came not to a&s;&s;i&s;t either &s;ide, but to make their utmo&s;t advantage of both. No &s;ooner had the a&s;&s;ailants of this brave cavalier beheld them coming, but they all ran away; only he alone &s;et him in a po&s;ture of defence to pre&s;erve the lady; but, overpowered by their numbers, they forced him to &s;ubmit to their will; yet not before he had received four de&s;perate wounds in the body; in revenge of which he had &s;lain four of the be&s;t men belonging to their ve&s;&s;el. They conveyed Cynthia, with Or&s;amus, on board the boat, intending to &s;at|isfy the death of their companions with the au|thor who had occa&s;ioned it. They put off from &s;hore, and began to prepare for his exe|cution; mean while the fair Cynthia, who&s;e &s;pirits were newly returned to execute their proper functions, &s;at almo&s;t di&s;&s;olved in tears, beholding the&s;e preparations for Or&s;amus's
<PB N="9" REF="033593_0008_0FF79737D4CE9190">
death, fearfully apprehending what &s;he could not as yet know the cau&s;e of; going unto him that &s;eemed commander of the re&s;t, &s;he de|manded "to what u&s;e tho&s;e weapons, and preparations of death were made?" He return|ed an&s;wer, "for that cavalier who in her de|fence had &s;lain four of the be&s;t men belonging unto his &s;hip." "Sir, replyed Cynthia, that young man is my brother; and ye cannot well blame him in what he did in the defence of a dear &s;i&s;ter: and &s;ure the cour&s;e you would take is indirect, &s;ince if you fulfil your re&s;olu|tions, you can gain nothing by his death, but pre&s;erving his life, you may receive a great ran|&s;om.</P>
<P>The &s;weet thought of gain, delivered from &s;uch a lovely creature, &s;et both his love and covetou&s;ne&s;s on the rack. In fine, the hope of gain turned the current of their revenge, in execution of which their choler abated, and they re&s;ted &s;atisfied. But it was not &s;o with their commander, for the eyes of his fair pri&s;|oner had opened them&s;elves a pa&s;&s;age, and darted their re&s;plendant rays into the &s;oul of this fierce pirate. He found &s;uch charms as it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible, and mere folly, to &s;tand in oppo&s;ition again&s;t them. Here was a meta|morpho&s;e wrought by the force of love and beauty, a barbarian civilized to a milder tem|per; for, acco&s;ting his fair prey, he compo&s;ed
<PB N="10" REF="033593_0009_0FF797F9C4499C48">
all that was fierce and rude to re&s;pect and duty. "Madam, replied he, 'tis enough that you de&s;ire your brother &s;hould live; re&s;t &s;atis|fied, he &s;hall live only for your &s;ake; not &s;o much for our intere&s;t as for your content; for we could well have di&s;pen&s;ed with our gain to give our revenge precedence: but your de&s;ires have put a period to our re&s;entment; thus you reign triumphant while you e&s;teem your&s;elf a captive. O madam, continued he, cea&s;e tho&s;e &s;howers: clear up tho&s;e bright &s;tars, have you any de&s;ire? Give them a name; for I find it irre&s;i&s;table to give you a denial. Re|tire to yonder cabin, which &s;hall be wholly at your di&s;po&s;al. Your menial &s;ervants &s;hall not be more officious, than the&s;e my men that &s;eem &s;o barbarous &s;hall be dutiful at your com|mands. For my&s;elf I'll pay my re&s;pects with as much cha&s;te zeal as we pay our devotion to the offended deities, at &s;uch a time only when my vi&s;its will not incommode you: for I am not &s;o much a pirate but I know what civilities ought to be paid to ladies of your quality; which, as you appear to me, is not mean.&mdash; Re&s;t firm in the a&s;&s;urance of my promi&s;e, whil&s;t I take care for the &s;peedy dre&s;&s;ing of your brother's wounds, and for his accomodation in the &s;hip." Saying this, he left her in pro|found re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Or&s;amus, who was an auditor and &s;pectator
<PB N="11" REF="033593_0010_0FF797398F337AC0">
of the di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the pirate and Cynthia, was tran&s;ported with ravi&s;hment when he under&s;tood that &s;he was his pre&s;erv|er. "Nay, &s;aid he, &s;ince my life is not indif|ferent to my fair divinity, I'll live to free her from this captivity, or peri&s;h in the attempt; &s;ince &s;he &s;eems to have an e&s;teem for my life, I'll endeavour to pre&s;erve it, for I cannot but prize what &s;he e&s;teems." The&s;e words were overheard by tho&s;e that guarded him: but being &s;poken in Engli&s;h were not under|&s;tood. By their captain's command he was carefully conducted into the hold, where he had a lodging a&s;&s;igned him, and &s;urgeons &s;ent him that &s;earched his wounds, which they found dangerous, but not mortal: they careful|ly dre&s;&s;ed them and left him unto his re&s;t.</P>
<P>While things were thus &s;tated, they would have tacked about again for the &s;hore, to have received their expected ran&s;om for Or&s;amus; but there aro&s;e a cruel tempe&s;t, which convey+ed them many leagues from thence into the main ocean. The captain was not &s;o &s;orry for di&s;appointing his men of their hopes, becau&s;e he had an opportunity to oblige Cynthia with the &s;tayance of her &s;uppo&s;ed brother; as al&s;o to benefit him&s;elf in making him the &s;olicitor of his love.</P>
<P>Three days had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the la&s;t di&s;a&s;ter befel Cynthia; mean time Or&s;amus was care|fully
<PB N="12" REF="033593_0011_0FF7973D27A43180">
dre&s;&s;ed, and officiou&s;ly attended, and Cynthia &s;erved with caution, the pirate never vi&s;iting her without permi&s;&s;ion. On the fourth day he invited her to take a walk on the deck. It was about the time Sol left watery Neptune's bed and newly darted his rays upon the face of the water.</P>
<P>Cynthia accorded with his de&s;ire; and kindly pre&s;enting him her hand, they went both forth the cabin. But oh! what a mine of beauties did the LIGHT pre&s;ent, which grief, and that di&s;mal place had detained from his eyes; for the pain and fear &s;he &s;uffered for Or&s;amus, by the a&s;&s;urance of his &s;afety, was partly vani&s;hed away, &s;o that the beauty they had put to flight, was almo&s;t returned back again to its u&s;ual lu&s;tre, which this pirate took &s;ome time to contemplate and admire.&mdash; The encrea&s;e of her beauty augmented his pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;parks of love and pity that lay hid be|fore, began to blaze into a flame, as by the &s;equel will appear; for after &s;he had &s;weetly complained unto him of the detaining of her freedom, and, that according to his promi&s;e, he had not put her brother to his ran&s;om, taking a hint from the&s;e words he began as followeth:</P>
<P>"Madam, &s;aid he, would I &s;et your freedom to &s;ale, a kingdom were too little to buy the ran&s;om. If your brother's liberty has been de|ferred,
<PB N="13" REF="033593_0012_0FF7973FA028D190">
perhaps your intere&s;t was the chief oc|ca&s;ion, when in &s;ome &s;ort to oblige you, I have neglected &s;o great a gain. For &s;hould I accord with you in this one thing, touching your freedom, po&s;&s;ibly I &s;hould divorce my eyes from the deare&s;t object forever. Mad|am, I love you, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee you and be in&s;en&s;ible. I have a pa&s;&s;ion for you that nothing can extingui&s;h but death; but it is legitimate, and may be owned by you without a &s;cruple, were your condition equal to the degrees of a prince&s;s. My birth is not ignoble, altho the di&s;a&s;ters of my life have been uncommon; nor becau&s;e I &s;eem ru&s;tic, is my condition &s;o mean, &s;ince the king of Norway, a few days &s;ince, profered me his neice to wife, which upon my return to Norway, I did intend to accompli&s;h; and had certainly ef|fected it, had not your prodigious beauty di&s;|appointed my de&s;igns. And for your liberty, how can you account it a re&s;traint when your goaler has become your &s;lave? Abate but the thoughts of &s;eparation, and your de&s;ire cannot name another thing &s;hould meet my refu&s;al. If once I be &s;o happy to attain the &s;hore of Norway, whither I intended in a few days to go, I will &s;pend the re&s;idue of this wretched life at your feet." Here he contin|ued &s;ilent, leaving Cynthia in amaze at the di&s;covery of his pa&s;&s;ion; yet being obliged to reply, &s;he returned the following an&s;wer.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033593_0013_0FF79741316F22D8">Sir, your re&s;pective u&s;age could not give me more &s;atisfaction then your unplea&s;ant di&s;|cour&s;e gives me di&s;content, &s;ince you take away the hopes of my liberty in denying my ran&s;om. Never think by con&s;traint to gain my affection, nor by detaining my liberty to make me become kind. Would I accord to your will, I am at my brother's di&s;po&s;al, whom you di&s;a|ble in denying him freedom, but never think by &s;uch rude ways, to force love; for your hopes will all fail you; for my &s;oul is free, al|though my body be your pri&s;oner; and you &s;hall find I can die when I cannot live. Say|ing this, &s;he left him and returned to her cab|in.</P>
<P>Mean while the pirate &s;tood like one tran&s;|formed: yet, not minding to de&s;pair of the fir&s;t repul&s;e, when he had the per&s;on in his power; &s;o that recollecting his &s;pirits, he went immediately to give Or&s;amus a vi&s;it, who&s;e wounds by this time were fa&s;t recover|ing.</P>
<P>After &s;alutations pa&s;t, he de&s;ired him to be his a&s;&s;i&s;tant to his &s;i&s;ter, who prote&s;ted never to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf without his con&s;ent: promi&s;ing him in recompence to give him his freedom: or if he would go with him to Nor|way he &s;hould have ample revenues to &s;ub&s;i&s;t during life. Or&s;amus thanked him, and &s;aid, if he would allow him the freedom to vi&s;it his
<PB N="15" REF="033593_0014_0FF79743932D5128">
&s;i&s;ter, he would perform the utmo&s;t of his en|deavours to procure her con&s;ent; that if his felicity depended upon his di&s;po&s;al, he would be no ob&s;truction to defer it; that &s;eeing he had put him to choice, he had rather go to Norway with his &s;i&s;ter, than to return without her into his own country. Thus he was forc|ed to delude him with hopes, &s;o to detain him within the bounds of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The pirate was &s;atisfied at the freedom of his di&s;cour&s;e, giving the phy&s;ician orders, when his wounds would permit him, to let him have free acce&s;s to his &s;i&s;ter's chamber, and li|berty of conver&s;ation, at &s;uch times as he be&s;t plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This pa&s;t he left him to his re&s;t; but this tran&s;port was too great to let him mind that nece&s;&s;ary mini&s;ter of his health: that which Cynthia had done for him in pre&s;erving his life, by adopting him with that happy title of brother, and la&s;tly, not to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf without his con&s;ent, was a fit &s;ubject to exer|ci&s;e his thoughts upon. Now her former rig|ours were all vani&s;hed to his memory, and he con&s;idered her only as his benefactor, and orig|inal of his felicity.</P>
<P>He pa&s;t away his time in &s;uch plea&s;ing tran&s;|ports, ever fancing the idea of his faire&s;t Cyn|thia before his eyes, that all other thoughts were hu&s;hed in &s;ilence; his contentment &s;eem|ed
<PB N="16" REF="033593_0015_0FF79747CE378AA8">
perfect, and his wounds received an addi|tional cure, from the temperature and quietne&s;s of his mind, &s;o that in two days time he found him&s;elf in a capacity to vi&s;it his deare&s;t phy&s;i|cian; which being made known to the pirate, the more to oblige Cynthia, he intended to pre&s;ent him unto her him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Twas about the time that Phoebus had clim|ed into his mid-day height, and began to drive his chariot to the we&s;tern &s;eas, when Or&s;amus accompanied him to Cynthia's cabin. They found her &s;itting in the mo&s;t di&s;mal part of the room, very di&s;con&s;olate, accompanied only with a mournful &s;ilence. At their fir&s;t en|trance, the pirate &s;aluted her in this manner: Madam, &s;ince the di&s;concealing of my love has begotton your di&s;quiet, I have courted all op|portunities to di&s;&s;ipate your re&s;entment, yet I fear you will not welcome the happne&s;s, be|cau&s;e I bring it. This &s;aid with great re&s;pect, he departed out of the Cabin.</P>
<P>Scarce had he given an exit, &s;hutting the door after him, but Or&s;amus in a tran&s;port ca&s;t him&s;elf at her feet &s;o ha&s;tily, as &s;he had neither time nor power to prevent him. But &s;he, un|willing to let him remain in that condition, pre&s;ented him her hand, Ri&s;e Or&s;amus (&s;aid &s;he) this pro&s;trate action can &s;carce obtain its pardon; your pre&s;ence at this time is not un|welcome, &s;ince it has quietted me of &s;ome fears
<PB N="17" REF="033593_0016_0FF797495F8FF4C0">
that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed me in your ab&s;ence, concern|ing your welfare, and the wounds you receiv|ed in my defence.</P>
<P>The&s;e wounds (replied Or&s;amus) have been le&s;s cruel than tho&s;e I received from your fair eyes; they would admit of a cure, but the&s;e daily augment, without hope of remedy. Oh! my deare&s;t prince&s;s! I die daily, and every moment begets a new death. If your anger has prepared me a condemnation, I will re|ceive the fatal doom from your mouth with a perfect and entire obedience. Believe it, Or|&s;amus, (replied &s;he) you will not obtain it &s;o ea&s;ily as your imagination flatters you; neith|er prehaps has my &s;everity proceeded from the cau&s;e your opinion has taken it. No, no; I have not been in&s;en&s;ible of your love, nor re|gardle&s;s of your merits, but have prized them both at their true value in my brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Or&s;amus bowing his head at this di&s;cour&s;e with a profound re&s;pect; Then, Madam, re|plied he, I am not utterly lo&s;t, for if my prin|ce&s;s vote me happy, I will bid defiance to for|tune's malice; &s;ince &s;he cannot with all her &s;tock of misfortunes make me mi&s;erable. But, Madam, what &s;hall this happy wretch do, who&s;e life you have pre&s;erved with &s;uch exce&s;s of ge|nero&s;ity? what price &s;hall he add for the lea&s;t of the&s;e divine bounties: by a fidelity, repli|ed Cynthia, which I value above my father's

crown; and, by which till death you may pre&s;erve that affection, whereon you e&s;tabli&s;h your happine&s;s. If that be the means, replied Or&s;amus, I will be happy to my tomb, and all human con&s;iderations &s;hall not make me wa|ver one moment in my inviolable loyalty. But, Madam, continued he, after a &s;mall pau&s;e, if I may have licence to a&s;k it, how &s;hall we di&s;|po&s;e of our affairs in this condition, whereinto fortune hath blindly brought us? The happy title of brother you have conferred on me, hath pre&s;erved my life and by your bounty I begin to prize it at its true value, &s;o that I can dare the effects of fate. But for you, my dear prince&s;s, that you &s;hould be brought to &s;uch extremes, is that which galls my heart with unexpre&s;&s;ible grief. My misfortunes are become my chief felicity, but I am too mi&s;era|ble in yours; you have rai&s;ed me to the height of human happine&s;s, then gratitude calls that I &s;hould purcha&s;e your content. Fortune, &s;pight of her&s;elf, &s;hall &s;hortly give you ea&s;e, or put a period to the cau&s;e; &s;ince to expect her to be kind, is to involve our&s;elves in greater dangers. De&s;perate wounds mu&s;t have de&s;|perate cures; extremes mu&s;t be thus &s;erved, when bli&s;s and happine&s;s be in danger of a wreck, boldly to dare it, bravely to pre&s;erve it. Thou wretched rival, ob&s;tructor of my bli&s;s, continued he with a tone &s;omewhat ele|vated,

I'll give an exit to thy love and life; though guarded by a thou&s;and &s;words, nothing &s;hall &s;ecure thee from my arms; if I fail in the attempt, I &s;hall have the &s;atisfaction, that I did endeavour your quiet, though I could not ef|fect it.</P>
<P>O Sir! &s;aid Cynthia, with a timerous agita|tion of &s;pirit, do not with &s;uch ra&s;h re&s;olution ca&s;t away your life, but con&s;ider that &s;troke that ends your days gives a period to mine.&mdash; Oh! think in the cu&s;tody of what villains I &s;hall be left, acquainted with nothing but what is ill! Then death may fly me; and that may be taken from me I e&s;teem far above my life. I &s;hall have none then to participate in my &s;or|rows, or revenge my quarrels, when you are gone. Death, when all hope is pa&s;t, will not fail to relieve us; fortune is full of vici&s;&s;itudes; and being unkind &s;o long, mu&s;t at la&s;t be ju&s;t: that valour is unconquerable to which di&s;cre|tion is joined, when wi&s;dom directs it for the mo&s;t advantage.

Becau&s;e he has made you the agent of his love, you may feed him with hope; for it will be dangerous to lo&s;e tho&s;e advantages he hopes from you: My carriage unto him &s;hall be followed by your ad|vice; and you may tell him what your rea&s;on and wi&s;dom accords to, is convenient; always re&s;erving my honor intire. And &s;eeing Or|&s;amus, I repo&s;e my honor in your tru&s;t, look you do not fail my confidence. O, Mad|am! replied Or&s;amus, that life which you &s;et &s;o high a prize on is not worth the care you take to pre&s;erve it; but it were no life were it not wholly at your devotion; and being only yours, I &s;hall be careful not to ca&s;t that life u&s;ele&s;s away, which is re&s;erved wholly and entire for your intere&s;t. Your commands &s;hall lead me by the hand, which I will execute as far as weary life will go. 'Twere a &s;in, re|plied Cynthia, to doubt your fidelity and the continuance may not go unrewarded. But let us leave this di&s;cour&s;e for &s;ome time more agreeable, and con&s;ider how to treat the pirate at his return, which will not be long. I'll &s;hew my&s;elf &s;omewhat kinder, that he may conceive you have prevailed &s;omething in his behalf; and, this kindne&s;s, if my expectation fail me not, &s;hall purcha&s;e a relation of his life&punc;

which will for a &s;mall time free me from his importunities, and in &s;ome &s;ort di&s;&s;ipate my misfortunes by the hi&s;tory of his di&s;a&s;ters, &s;ince we naturally find a plea&s;ure in the reher|&s;al of pa&s;t mi&s;eries. His re&s;pect and behav|ior towards us &s;hews him to be more than what he &s;eems; yet this odious cour&s;e makes him &s;eem le&s;s than what he is.

<P>In &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es they pa&s;&s;ed away the &s;mall time of the pirate's ab&s;ence; but fortune &s;oon took care they &s;hould not &s;urfeit their joys, by ha&s;tening his return to the cabin.

<P>He was opening his mouth to &s;peak, when the fair prince&s;s prevented him; and taking the word with an air, replied, with a grace and behaviour only peculiar to her&s;elf, &s;he began her di&s;cour&s;e thus. "Sir, your kind|ne&s;s u&s;ed to my brother is no &s;mall obligation that I owe you, nor have you failed in your purpo&s;e when you made him your &s;olicitor; &s;ince none can more per&s;uade my inclination or more freely di&s;po&s;e of me than he; yet he, I think, will not agree to force my will to what

Such you may be if your life has been regulated and guided by that rule formerly, as in this time &s;ince we have been your pri&s;oners. But the faire&s;t fruit is not always plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te; nor will a wi&s;e merchant purcha&s;e commodities without a trial.

<P>This bold language of Cynthia put the pi|rate to his dumps, knowing the relation of his life would dimini&s;h the e&s;teem they had of him; and &s;hould he give her a denial, he began to fear her fir&s;t re&s;olution; &s;o that for a &s;mall time his thoughts were upon the rack, and he &s;at po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a deep &s;ilence; but at la&s;t re|collecting him&s;elf, he made this reply.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRAGICAL ACCOUNT OF THE UNFORTUNATE LOVES OF ALMERIN AND DESDEMONA:</HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> &s;ea is &s;ituated an i&s;land called Sicilia, renowned over the world for the &s;weet whole&s;omne&s;s of the air, and fer|tility of the &s;oil; extolled highly by fame for the wonderful mountain Etna, there fixed; which being always on the out&s;ide covered with &s;now, yet by a &s;ulpherous or brim&s;tone matter doth continually burn within. Often|times the flame mounting upwards is &s;o &s;trong it brings up with it burnt and &s;corching &s;tones, and pieces of hard &s;ub&s;tances, which &s;eem to be rent out of &s;ome rocks, to the great terror and danger of the beholder. Report has not been idle in proclaiming the known rarities of this i&s;le; but above all, that &s;o much famed ci|ty of Syracu&s;e, twenty-two miles in compa&s;s, walled about with three &s;trong walls, for &s;trength and &s;ecurity; watered with many &s;weet &s;prings adorned with many gardens, and plea&s;ant ar|bours;

the noble buildings added to its gran|deur, who&s;e lofty towers and turrets &s;eemed to &s;upport the &s;kies, retaining a maje&s;ty, and yielding a glorious &s;hew to the eyes of the be|holders. It was the mart town of the i&s;land where &s;hips go out, and re&s;ort thither, to and from all parts of the world, which enriches the inhabitants.</P>
<P>It was this city that gave me birth; although my father had his original out of Norway, a kingdom far hence di&s;tant, towards the fro|zen north, his inclinations being more to trav|el &s;trange countries than live a quiet life in his own; when the one begets nothing but effem|inatene&s;s and &s;loth, and the other produces ex|perience and valour. So that with his father's con&s;ent he took his journey, having well &s;tored him&s;elf with jewels and money, nece&s;&s;aries ve|ry needful for &s;uch a voyage; in a few years he ranged over the greate&s;t part of Afri|ca and A&s;ia, where he &s;aw the famous cities of Grand Cairo in Egypt, the city ot Jeru&s;alem in Pale&s;tina; where he did behold many rare monuments, with the lofty pyramids. Hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed through many large dominions, at la&s;t he arrived at Con&s;tantinople, the imperial city of the Grecian empire. Here he &s;pent &s;ome time, and at la&s;t took &s;hipping there to vi&s;it the i&s;les of the Mediterranean &s;ea; &s;o that he came at la&s;t to the famous i&s;land of Sicilia,
<PB N="25" REF="033593_0024_0FF7975BD83D4AB0">
where the plea&s;antne&s;s both invited and incited his longer &s;tay and abode.</P>
<P>Where, by &s;trange fortunes and unheard of chances, he was made known unto King San|credus, who at that time had his re&s;idence in Syracu&s;e, in who&s;e affection he gained &s;o great an e&s;teem, as he gave his own kin&s;woman in marriage, enriched him with &s;everal lord&s;hips, made him one of his council, and Governor of the famous city of Syracu&s;e.</P>
<P>I was his only &s;on, and in this city I receiv|ed my life and education. I lived with my father in a garb befitting a prince rather than a Governor's &s;on. All their hope and comfort they &s;eemed to trea&s;ure up in me. Thus I continued until I arrived at the age of &s;ixteen years, and became capable to receive the im|pre&s;&s;ion of love.</P>
<P>Small time had pa&s;&s;ed away afterwards before fortune pre&s;ented me an object to beget it.&mdash; For fate had &s;o decreed, that in a plea&s;ant gar|den belonging to the city, garni&s;hed with ma|ny private walks, among which I had cho&s;en out one for privacy, to retire from the &s;corch|ing heat of the &s;un, here it was I went to &s;eek re&s;t, and found eternal di&s;quiet; for by the bank of a little rivulet, which had a thorough|fare, and many turnings in the garden, &s;at a mo&s;t beautiful dam&s;el, who had &s;eated her&s;elf as it were to ob&s;erve the &s;ecret gliding of the
<PB N="26" REF="033593_0025_0FF7975D8C8BAB80">
murmuring &s;tream. The place where I had retired was &s;o ordered by nature, that I could &s;ee, yet remain un&s;een. Her years might be about fourteen; her &s;tature tall, and comely; her face the perfect map of beauty, where the lillies and the ro&s;es did &s;eem to &s;urpa&s;s in glory what nature had ever framed, or art ever per|fected; I beheld her with amazement; for never before did my eyes behold any thing &s;o lovely.</P>
<P>Thus unperceived was I conquered by this unknown beauty; and at that fatal hour, with|out re&s;i&s;tance, I became her &s;lave, and re&s;olv|ed to wear her chains.</P>
<P>Yet how to make my addre&s;&s;es unto one that till then I never &s;aw, or to talk of love to her, both &s;eemed gro&s;s&punc; the fir&s;t &s;eemed too full of confidence, and the other &s;eemed to fa|vour much of impudence.</P>
<P>But here fortune &s;upplied this want, and at fir&s;t &s;eemed to court me; but it was only to drill me into greater mi&s;eries; for no &s;ooner I &s;aw her ri&s;e from the place where &s;he &s;at, but I made towards her, from the place where I lay concealed, when behold this charming beau|ty was &s;urprized by an unknown &s;tranger, who with expre&s;&s;ions of joy uttered the&s;e words; "Fortune, I defy thy further malice, and dare my fate to make a &s;econd relap&s;e in my de|&s;ires"&mdash;So that by force, in &s;pite of her re&s;i&s;t|ance,
<PB N="27" REF="033593_0026_0FF7975F3A161E00">
taking her delicate body rudely in his arms, he began with a more than ordinary pace to convey her to a neighbouring thicket. My eyes had never left her, but were wholly em|ployed and fixed on this in&s;olent action, per|formed on &s;o lovely a creature. I needed no &s;olicitors but her cries to prepare me for a re|venge; and it was but a few moments betwixt the re&s;olution and the execution; for with the utmo&s;t dilligence I pur&s;ued him by the &s;ame track I &s;aw him pa&s;s. Such expedition I made that my ha&s;te outwent his &s;peed, and my fury overtook him before I had time to con&s;ult with rea&s;on; &s;o that without demanding any que&s;|tions, I run him through the body, and he not having di&s;burthened him&s;elf of his fair prey, fell down, cla&s;ping her in his deadly arms.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I did was to free her from him, which with &s;ome trouble I performed.&mdash; After I had &s;et her at liberty from that danger, and her frighted &s;pirits returned to her again, &s;he fell down at my feet, and embracing my knee, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, this &s;udden a&s;&s;i&s;tance per|&s;uades me to e&s;teem you as the genius of my better fortune, &s;ince you have by timely re|demption pre&s;erved what is more precious to me than that we prize mo&s;t dear.</P>
<P>Her tears and &s;weet &s;peeches transformed me from my u&s;ual temper; and I could not behold her in that mournful po&s;ture without
<PB N="28" REF="033593_0027_0FF79761B0638708">
participating in her &s;orrows; &s;o that taking her in my arms, I returned her this an&s;wer: Madam, I rejoice in being made the happy cau&s;e of pre&s;erving you, if I have obliged you in this action, I have a &s;atisfaction above what I could hope, and fortune has been kind above my hopes, in affording an opportunity to man|ife&s;t my affection.

If you think I have obliged you, Oh! pay it in love, and I &s;hall &s;oon become the debtor; and talk not of death, when the gods dete&s;t thy propo&s;itions; but think lovely creature, if &s;o much beauty can be without pity, and yield no redre&s;s to my love, death will be kinder than you, and yield a remedy when you deny it.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, I &s;et my &s;word again&s;t my brea&s;t, &s;aying, here Madam, is that, that will yield re|lief in nece&s;&s;ity; and &s;eeing I cannot live without love, I will endeavour in death to gain your pity; and if my love is become an of|fence, this very &s;word &s;hall make &s;atisfaction, and de&s;troy that life that gave it birth.

<P>Virtuous lady, replied I, you wrong my love to think it ba&s;e, and my integrity to imag|ine I may prove uncon&s;tant. No, no Madam, your charms are too &s;trong to be rivalled by any other objects, and affection too entire to be deceived by any other beauty. Becau&s;e you &s;hall not be obliged to love one you know not, and to e&s;teem one that till this moment you never &s;aw; to di&s;per&s;e tho&s;e doubts, know my name is Almerin, the only &s;on of Artme|dorus govenor of this famous city of Syracu&s;e; never before unfortunate, if you prove pitile&s;s; never before happy, if you become kind. If ever I endeavour to violate your honor, or think to commit &s;o great a &s;acrilege on your virtue, let all the gods rain down vengeance on my head for my di&s;loyalty, and let the heavens be witne&s;s to what I promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Oh hold! &s;aid &s;he, &s;wear not by that; can|kers may eat a flower on the &s;talk: and when in the&s;e cheeks and lips which you extol &s;o high, &s;hall not be left red enough to blu&s;h at perjury, when you &s;hall make it, what will be|come of me then?</P>
<P>O Madam! replied I, cea&s;e tho&s;e doubts&punc;

and di&s;&s;ipate &s;uch needle&s;s fear; the &s;un &s;hall as &s;oon faulter in his career, the &s;tars drop from their places, where they have of old been fixed; the earth &s;hall remove, nature &s;hall al|ter her cour&s;e, and all impo&s;&s;ibilities &s;hall be performed, when I prove di&s;loyal.</P>
<P>The&s;e prote&s;tations did give her &s;ome &s;atis|faction; and prevailed &s;o far with her, that &s;he &s;uffered me to enjoy the privilege to accom|pany her to her parent's hou&s;e, which was within the city. When we came thither &s;he gave her friends to under&s;tand the timely a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance I gave her, as al&s;o my birth and quality, and authority in the city. They no &s;ooner received this relation from their daughter, but they bade me welcome, and care&s;&s;ed me with the greate&s;t endearments. My entertainment was extraordinary: but the kindne&s;s that was be&s;towed on me was not after the lofty court mode, but mo&s;t familiarly, as if I had been a near relation to them, and gave me thanks in the mo&s;t obliging terms for the kindne&s;s conferr|ed on their daughter, which I could receive without a blu&s;h. Here it was I learned his name was Phila&s;ter, an aged knight, that liv|ed there many years; that his fair daughter was his only child, who&s;e name was De&s;demo|na.</P>
<P>In &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es we pa&s;&s;ed away the time while &s;upper la&s;ted, where the chiefe&s;t delica|cies
<PB N="31" REF="033593_0030_0FF797686CF5CFB8">
I fed on was De&s;demona's beauty; and indeed it was &s;he alone made all things &s;eem plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Supper being ended; and the evening far &s;pent I began to prepare for my departure. Af|ter I had bade farewel to the old knight and his lady, I began to order my&s;elf to take leave of the fair De&s;demona, and in this manner I acco&s;ted her, "Faire&s;t of creatures, let not ab&s;ence beget a neglect in my love, but think of the torments I endure; and though nece&s;|&s;ity enforces me to leave you, yet think how all places will &s;eem a hell when you are ab&s;ent; and that you bring a heaven of felicities, when|ever your fair &s;elf doth appear. O De&s;demo|na! I mu&s;t leave you; yet &s;hall I tell you, a poor criminal never went to execution with more reluctancy than this cruel parting &s;eems to me, &s;ince I mu&s;t leave all my happine&s;s with you, and go away accompanied only with my torments and mi&s;eries." I had proceeded farther, but I &s;aw &s;ome attentive to under&s;tand what I &s;aid.</P>
<P>De&s;demona returned me no an&s;wer, but a blu&s;h. And after I had with an extacy &s;ealed a ki&s;s on her fair hand, I took my leave; yet not before the old knight and his lady de&s;ired me that I would honor them &s;o much as to further oblige them with a vi&s;it.

<P>But &s;mall re&s;t, heaven knows, it was I could take: my fancy formed the idea of fair De&s;de|mona; and it was only the&s;e thoughts that did give a &s;mall ce&s;&s;ation to my torments.</P>
<P>In this &s;ort I pa&s;&s;ed away the time, thinking the night exceeded its u&s;ual length, exclaiming again&s;t Phoebus for his &s;luggi&s;h approach; and yet when he did appear, how often have I wi&s;h|ed his ab&s;ence! &s;o that night &s;eemed a vexa|tion, and day a torment.

<P>Faire&s;t lady, &s;aid he looking upon Cynthia, you will not marvel, nor have occa&s;ion to blame me, when you under&s;tand that about &s;ix weeks before I was betrothed, by my parents con&s;ent, to a fair dam&s;el named Arteme&s;ia, &s;econd daughter to the earl of Palermo. Indeed I think &s;he was more noble than fair, yet her beauty was not &s;o mean but it might have &s;atis|fied my nicety, had I never beheld the be|witching charms of fair De&s;demona.&mdash;'Twas on this fatal marriage I was de&s;tinated a victim to my parents will, not my de&s;ires. I knew my father to be a man too pa&s;&s;ionate, and not to be altered by per&s;ua&s;ions in his proceedings. Be&s;ides, this marriage &s;eemed to augment and agree with his ambition; and his being allied to &s;o great a lord, no mean honor. He was ob&s;tinate in his humours, nor could rea&s;on make him rever&s;e what he had decreed; but e&s;pecially tho&s;e he imagined did tend to fur|ther
<PB N="34" REF="033593_0033_0FF797700BB9F018">
and advance his a&s;piring ambition. The&s;e were the unhappy cau&s;es that I did not reveal to them the affection I had for the fair De&s;de|mona.</P>
<P>As nothing continues always in one &s;tate and condition, &s;o my di&s;temper began to abate, and my weakened body began to recover a little &s;trength; yet in my mind I received no com|fort, &s;ince my deare&s;t phy&s;ician was ab&s;ent.&mdash; Phoebus had &s;carce run his career thrice in this upper world, and lodged him&s;elf in the we&s;tern ocean, but I left my bed: and though I was extremely feeble, yet I did endeavour to walk, and the fir&s;t &s;mall journey I made, was &s;ecret|ly to De&s;demona. I had no &s;ooner &s;et my face towards that part of the city, but mark the wonderful effects! although my body was weak, yet methought in every &s;tep I went towards her I received new &s;trength; when I arrived, and entered the hou&s;e, my body became as if it had been in&s;pired with a new &s;oul; and well it might, &s;ince it was there alone the felicity and content, which was the extacy and rapture of my &s;oul, did re&s;ide.</P>
<P>Such unthought of alteration had my &s;mall time of &s;ickne&s;s begotten on me, that none in the hou&s;e could hardly di&s;cern who I might be; but the&s;e thoughts were &s;ilenced when I reveal|ed my&s;elf; &s;o that they &s;eemed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with amazement rather than unbelief. In a

few moments all their &s;u&s;picions were vani&s;h|ed, &s;o that I was entertained with their accu&s;t|omed kindne&s;&s;es. In a few moments fair De&s;|demona did appear; and although &s;he was forewarned by &s;ome in the hou&s;e, yet in her fir&s;t approach &s;he could not contain from won|der. She bade me welcome as her deliverer, not as lover; yet did her eyes &s;peak pity to my di&s;a&s;ters; and then her looks &s;eemed a &s;ov|ereign bal&s;am to expel the wor&s;t of mi&s;eries: what &s;hall I &s;ay, it was here my &s;ickne&s;s took its birth, and it was here I had the only reme|dy to expel it.</P>
<P>After dinner the old knight and his lady, with fair De&s;demona, invited me to take a walk into a fair garden adjoining their hou&s;e, beau|tified with &s;hady arbours, where nature was helped by art to make the work more exqui|&s;ite, and was adorned with many plea&s;ant walks.</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of the garden was a hou&s;e of plea&s;ure, the faire&s;t for workman&s;hip that ever I beheld; &s;o that nature grew envious that art &s;hould excel her, endeavouring with fine &s;hady trees, and what &s;weet &s;ummer's live|ry wears, to conceal it from the eyes of the &s;pectators, when the pretty birds that harbour in tho&s;e boughs &s;eem to cro&s;s her intents with their melodious notes, inviting the eyes of the beholder not to leave &s;o rare a work un&s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="033593_0035_0FF797752FD8CF50">Into this garden I accompanied them, where we had &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e on different &s;ubjects, which I think impertinent, and nothing relat|ing to the &s;tory of my life. Thus having pa&s;&s;|ed away &s;ome time, Phila&s;ter and his lady re|tired them&s;elves into the hou&s;e of plea&s;ure be|fore related, and left De&s;demona only to enter|tain me. This opportunity fell out above my thoughts; and being unwilling to lo&s;e &s;o fair a time, as we walked along the alleys I began this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Faire&s;t De&s;demona, I cannot tell whether <HI>I</HI> &s;hould &s;ay you are more kind than cruel, or whether you are more fair than <HI>I</HI> am mi&s;era|ble. See, my divine lady, behold <HI>I</HI> die alive; and what is more cruel than living death? can|not you pity one that dies for love? O, pierce my heart! It is the nobler way, and let me not live in &s;uch torments.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I</HI> am not in&s;en&s;ible of your love, nor do <HI>I</HI> take any plea&s;ure in your tor|ments; <HI>I</HI> would <HI>I</HI> could perform the one as willingly as <HI>I</HI> can the other, you &s;hould not lan|gui&s;h for a remedy. If a return of love and compa&s;&s;ion can give you ea&s;e, <HI>I</HI> can pity; if that be too low, <HI>I</HI> can grieve; if this will not do, O think, &s;ir, in what bands you are bound not to violate my honor. Oh! &s;eek not to ruin this, and command all things be&s;ides <HI>I</HI> am able to perform.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="033593_0036_0FF79777A5CE6FB0">O Madam, replied I, heaven &s;end tho&s;e pun|i&s;hments on my head I &s;o lately did invocate, if I intend di&s;honor to you per&s;on.

Oh! think if you can pity, as you give me to under&s;tand you can; be not cruel to let me pine away with &s;orrow, when you are the only phy&s;ician that can give me a remedy.</P>
<P>I had &s;carce fini&s;hed the&s;e la&s;t words but old Phila&s;ter, and his lady, left the place where they had remained during our di&s;cour&s;e; and their too &s;udden approach robbed me of De&s;|demona's an&s;wer. So that we made towards them; and joining our company and di&s;cour&s;e with theirs, we pa&s;&s;ed away the re&s;idue of that time, fortune not offering me that day another opportunity where I might with &s;ecrecy renew our di&s;cour&s;e. After a while we left our diver|&s;ion, Phila&s;ter for&s;ook the garden, and we at|tended him in, where we &s;pent the remainder of the day. I then took my leave of my char|mer. And altho my de&s;ires were fru&s;trated, and my intentions prevented of &s;peaking unto her, by rea&s;on of her parents being pre&s;ent; yet my eyes and countenance &s;everely &s;poke the language of my heart.

<P><PB N="38" REF="033593_0037_0FF7977937989AE0">With this hope of good fortune I gave Phi|la&s;ter the good-night, and returned &s;ecretly to my father's, where they all wondered at my long ab&s;ence, yet glad to &s;ee me recovered &s;o well, wondering from whence the cau&s;e of &s;uch a &s;udden &s;ickne&s;s &s;hould ari&s;e, al&s;o at &s;o uncommon a recovery; but leaving them to conjectures, I went to my chamber, where I pa&s;&s;ed the night in a different manner from what I had formerly done, my hopes now having overcome my de&s;pair. In &s;uch plea&s;|ing thoughts the hours pa&s;&s;ed away; yet not &s;o &s;wift but I could number them, and think them &s;low in going. I aro&s;e and attired my|&s;elf with a more than ordinary curio&s;ity; build|ing many hopes in expectation of what the following day might bring forth, and the hour approaching wherein vi&s;its are accu&s;tomed to be given, I took my way to Phila&s;ter's hou&s;e. As my vi&s;its were become more common, I was e&s;teemed a le&s;s &s;tranger, and my enter|tainment was more familiar and friendly: &s;o that after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed, I reque&s;t|ed the favour of Phila&s;ter that I might take the privilege to pa&s;s &s;ome &s;mall time away in his fair garden: which reque&s;t was kindly granted, him&s;elf intending to accompany me; when behold, as we were entering the garden, he was &s;ent for by a me&s;&s;enger, that informed him that his brother did attend him, de&s;iring

&s;ome conferrences with him about earne&s;t occa|&s;ions that would not admit of delay; &s;o after pleading nece&s;&s;ity for his untimely parting, he left me.</P>
<P>Half an hour had not pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince I enter|ed the garden, but I &s;aw fair De&s;demona, who was &s;ent by her father to entertain me in his ab&s;ence. I made towards her with much re&s;pect, and &s;he acco&s;ted me with as kind a reception, with &s;uch innocency as might &s;eem to bring in compa&s;s the extravagant thoughts of any but my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here it was we betrothed our&s;elves to each other and regi&s;tered our vows in heaven.&mdash; Here it was I could not bound my joy, and con&s;equently my pa&s;&s;ion; &s;o that I could not retain from folding her delicate body in my arms, giving and receiving many a &s;weet ki&s;s on her ruby lips. In this rapture of ravi&s;h|ment we &s;pent the time, till Sol with his &s;corching beams, forced us to retire into that hou&s;e of plea&s;ure before-mentioned. This proved a defence again&s;t the heat, and a cov|er to act our loves more &s;ecurely.

to higher felicities. So that from the fa|miliar conver&s;ation I began to reque&s;t the fru|ition of that love I then enjoyed: and follow|ing my reque&s;ts with &s;uch intreaties and im|portunities, with a promi&s;e of never failing fi|delity, urged by &s;uch &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ions, and re&s;i&s;ted with &s;uch faint denials, that I came to the yielding up of that fort, which the great|e&s;t kings might envy me the conque&s;t of; in the enjoyment of which imperial monarchs would have accounted it the highe&s;t felicity; all which was wholly pro&s;trated to my raging pa&s;|&s;ion and lu&s;tful de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The ki&s;&s;es, embraces and endearments, were almo&s;t numberle&s;s, our di&s;cour&s;e treat|ing wholly of our loves and &s;ervent affections of the day of marriage.

With all expedition we for&s;ook our de|lights,

and de&s;cended down a private pair of &s;tairs, un&s;een of them, being &s;haded by the friendly trees, which, in the time of our de|lights, &s;eemed to &s;tand as watchmen to defend us, and now a &s;creen to &s;ecure us. This way we pa&s;&s;ed, left they might &s;u&s;pect what indeed was true, and &s;o prepared to meet them acci|dentally. Here we joined company and di&s;|cour&s;e with them, and pa&s;&s;ed away the re&s;idue of time till dinner was brought in, upon which notice was given, we left the garden, and &s;pent the remainder of that day altogether in diver|&s;ion, till night began to approach, and urged my departure; and returning them many thanks for their civilities and kindne&s;&s;es, I took my leave of Phila&s;ter and his lady; and hav|ing &s;aluted De&s;demona with a promi&s;e of a &s;ud|den return to require her in marriage of her parents, according to my vows in the garden, I left her, and with her all my joys.</P>
<P>I &s;oon arrived at my father's hou&s;e, but I found him inqui&s;itive above his u&s;ual manner, to know where I had pa&s;&s;ed away my time the&s;e three days pa&s;t; my ab&s;ence having be|got a &s;u&s;picion in him of what indeed was true; and &s;udden &s;ickne&s;s, &s;econded with as quick a recovery, did confirm him: &s;o that &s;eeing me well recovered, and almo&s;t in as good a &s;tate of health as when I fir&s;t fell &s;ick, he began his di&s;cour&s;e to me in this manner.</P>

Oh! how was I torn between love and duty! now it was love that led me in a maze &s;o difficult and intricate, that my be&s;t endeavours could not keep me from ruin.

<P>Such Madam, was my de&s;perate condition: my &s;weete&s;t hopes began to leave me, horror, de&s;pair began to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and fear razed out the expectation of a more happy change.

<P>After I had well weighed and con&s;idered all the difficulties on either &s;ide that might befal me.

<P>I did further re&s;olve not to acquaint De&s;de|mona with my father's re&s;olution, le&s;t it might beget her di&s;content. I began to repent of re|vealing to my father what I &s;hould have kept &s;ecret, and re&s;olved to conceal my pa&s;&s;ion for the future, &s;ince I had only given manife&s;ta|tion of love, and not of the per&s;on beloved, which I did expound as one happy pre&s;age of my fortunate proceeding. This way I had fixed on, &s;ince I had no other wherein I might walk with more &s;ecurity. Nor did my hopes altogether fail me; for by my cra&s;ty wiles, the next time I acco&s;ted my father, I had &s;et on &s;o &s;trange a face on my former pro|ceedings, &s;hewing my&s;elf &s;o dutiful and pliant to all his intents and purpo&s;es, as begat won|der in him when he did behold it.

<P>I under&s;tood very well the &s;ubtlene&s;s and craft he u&s;ed, and how like my&s;elf his actions were working one way, and his de&s;ires another, but both agreed to intrap me in my deare&s;t &s;e|cret.

<P>This compliance to his will, &s;o contrary to his expectations, began to work wonders in his mind, when my artifice had per&s;uaded him that all my former di&s;cour&s;es and prote&s;tations were mere deceit; &s;o that in&s;tead of continu|ing &s;o fierce in his proceedings he became more mild, his choler abated, he left accu&s;ing me, and began to excu&s;e him&s;elf.

<P>Whether this occa&s;ioned my father's enqui|ry to cea&s;e I cannot tell, but I well know I de|ceived him in his own craft, and over-wrought him in his own device.

<PB N="49" REF="033593_0048_0FF797934F5D78C0">
that by a &s;ecret way into the garden I &s;hould have acce&s;s at certain times, when I might &s;e|cretly enter; which to perform we appointed a time at our parting, or el&s;e by a certain to|ken of a handkerchief that gave me a&s;&s;urance that I might &s;ecurely pa&s;s.</P>
<P>By &s;uch &s;ecret and unmi&s;tru&s;ted paths, I of|ten times vi&s;ited my deare&s;t lady, who received me with as kind endearments; where I often|times enjoyed, without controul, the happy felicity and fruition of her love.</P>
<P>In the&s;e bitter &s;weets, and &s;tolen plea&s;ures, &s;ome three months had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince I fir&s;t &s;aw De&s;demona, and almo&s;t one &s;ince I had made her the la&s;t promi&s;e of wedlock. Now the time began to draw near to confirm by mar|riage, what I had already performed by con|tract with Artime&s;ia. And now alas! my deare&s;t De&s;demona found her&s;elf conceived and quick with child. In neglecting the fir&s;t I was &s;ure to procure my father's di&s;plea&s;ure; but in the latter, before God and man, I could not quit my&s;elf of the grievous ingratitude.&mdash; In the fir&s;t my ignorance might excu&s;e me; but to the latter I could plead no excu&s;e, &s;ince my vows to De&s;demona proceeded from my very &s;oul, and no doubt had reached the gates of heaven; when my contract with Artime&s;ia proceeded only of cour&s;e, and in &s;atisfaction of my father's humor, and not for any inclination
<PB N="50" REF="033593_0049_0FF79794E1BD6F98">
to love on my own part. So I re&s;olved to con|tinue firm and con&s;tant to De&s;demona, and procure my own content, in hazarding my fa|ther's di&s;plea&s;ure rather than to &s;atisfy his am|bition with my own torment.</P>
<P>The time approached in &s;ight wherein I mu&s;t be married to Artime&s;ia, but not the lea&s;t re|membrance was given me by my father for a preparation; &s;o that I began to bury the tho't of it in forgetfulne&s;s; thinking &s;ome difference had lately happened between my father and Artime&s;ia's parents; &s;o that I began to account my&s;elf &s;ecure as to that.</P>
<P>But a change of fortune &s;oon put me out of that mind; for one morning, when I did lit|tle &s;u&s;pect &s;uch deceit, my father de&s;ired me to array my&s;elf in my be&s;t attire, and wait on him to the great temple of the city. This I performed with great willingle&s;s, not mi&s;tru&s;t|ing that any deceit or treachery had lain hid in his reque&s;t; and before I could find the plot, I found my&s;elf &s;hip-wrecked on a rock. I was no &s;ooner ready but I attended him to church, only accompanied with my mother, who was of his confederacy. We &s;oon arriv|ed at the temple, yet with more ha&s;te then good &s;peed: for I was no &s;ooner entered, but to my amazement I &s;aw the earl of Palermo, with his daughter Artime&s;ia, with all his and my father's friends attending him, richly attired,
<PB N="51" REF="033593_0050_0FF79796730EE858">
and the prie&s;t &s;tanding ready to join our hands. They all came to receive and welcome me with much re&s;pect; but my amazement would not let me receive their kind endearments with a behaviour as I ought to have done; for it was &s;uch a &s;trange, di&s;agreeable and unac|ceptable &s;ight, that I could not &s;uddenly recov|er from my a&s;toni&s;hment; rather thinking it to be a dream or a fiction, than any thing el&s;e. My father came and rou&s;ed me from this trance; "Son, &s;aid he, wonder not at what you &s;ee, but recollect your&s;elf, and embrace your fortune. Surprizes in love make the en|joyment of greater value. And this bu&s;ine&s;s was managed by me, that a ble&s;&s;ing that falls on you unexpected, might be by you more prized and e&s;teemed. Cea&s;e your marvel then and acco&s;t tho&s;e friends with re&s;pect that are ready to receive you."</P>
<P>His di&s;cour&s;e being ended, and the compa|ny expecting an an&s;wer I replied, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s Artime&s;ia is a fortune above my hopes or de&s;erts; yet &s;uch a one as I cannot with &s;afety po&s;&s;e&s;s, le&s;t by enjoying &s;uch a happine&s;s, I &s;hould enforce heaven to make her wretched and mi&s;erable for my &s;ake. For to put you out of doubt, know I am betrothed already to one that is as virtuous as fair; with whom I have tied &s;uch an inviolable knot, that it is pa&s;t the art of man to unloo&s;e it without provoking
<PB N="52" REF="033593_0051_0FF7979B19EC5658">
the gods to revenge: there is no promi&s;e but I have made it, no prote&s;tation but I have per|formed it, no ceremony but I have &s;igned it, nor is there any obligation or vow but I have &s;ealed it. Heaven hath joined our hearts, this can only join our hands. In this, rea&s;on will tell you I have &s;hewn no di&s;obedience; &s;ince, as I lately told you, heaven gave me a &s;oul, and it is only that I have di&s;po&s;ed of with its con|&s;ent; my body is yet free which you gave me: but it may as well &s;urvive without a &s;oul as re|voke the vows I have lately made. My af|fection is &s;o entire, that if all things admit of charge, it cannot be &s;ubject to alteration. And &s;hould death it&s;elf approach I &s;hould continue firm in the grave.</P>
<P>I had continued my di&s;cour&s;e, but my fath|er ha&s;tily interrupting me, drew his &s;word, and pre&s;enting it to my brea&s;t, Die thou rebellious villain, &s;aid he, and enjoy the fruits of thy la|bor in the du&s;t. This action was no &s;ooner taken notice of by Artime&s;ia, but &s;he freed her&s;elf from her father; and ca&s;ting her&s;elf be|fore my father's weapon, hold, &s;aid &s;he, barba|rous and unnatural man, and pierce this brea&s;t, it will &s;hew le&s;s horrid and inhuman. This unexpected action, with his friends per&s;ua&s;ions and intreaties, made him &s;heath his &s;word, whil&s;t a &s;alamander did &s;eem to live in his eyes, which &s;hot forth fire like a murthering cannon that it
<PB N="53" REF="033593_0052_0FF7979CAADB2930">
lightens ere it &s;mokes. Wicked wretch, &s;aid he, I di&s;own thee from this hour from being my &s;on, and revoke all ties and privileges that love or nature hath given thee; and do not dare from this minute to a&s;&s;ume the confi|dence to appear in my pre&s;ence, as thou tend|ere&s;t thy life and &s;afety. Having &s;aid this, he left me in a rage.</P>
<P>My father was no &s;ooner departed, but poor Artime&s;ia received a check from her parents for her too much diligence and care in pre&s;erv|ing me, who did &s;light and neglect her; and that it rather pertained to my friends to have interceeded, and diverted the blow, than her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>My mother, with my relations, came and importuned me not to continue &s;o ob&s;tinate, with many intreaties and per&s;ua&s;ions, urged the danger I ca&s;t my&s;elf into, by bringing on my head my father's di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I was hitherto mi&s;erable, but I was more wretched in being beloved by Artime&s;ia. If her love and affection had not been &s;o great, there might have been hopes that my coldne&s;s might have begot an aver&s;ion in her towards me. But like a merchant o'er charged with debt, when he begins to fail, all things agree to ruin him; &s;o that he only knows then to be wretched, and they from whom he hopes any relief, mo&s;t times con&s;pire, and agree to his
<PB N="54" REF="033593_0053_0FF7979E71D8E128">
ruin. And as the Per&s;ians adore the ri&s;ing &s;un, and cur&s;e it again ere the day be half &s;pent, &s;o fortune &s;eems to court the man who flouri&s;heth in pro&s;perity and &s;cornfully neglects him when he falls into adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t blow, and I utterly undone. For upon notice of my con&s;ent, my father re|turned with Artime&s;ia, and the earl of Palermo her father, where, in the mid&s;t of a great throng of people, which this di&s;turbance had brought together, the prie&s;t joined our hands; the u&s;|ual ceremonies were performed with great &s;tate, which being once ended, I was attended by my father's friends, and a very great company of citizens to my father's hou&s;e, where, with, mu&s;ic, dancing and fea&s;ting, they pa&s;&s;ed away the re&s;idue of the day; and the night approach|ed, when my father, with the earl of Paler|mo, conducted us to our lodging, where they left us, as they imagined, to make a new ban|quet of plea&s;ures. But they were no &s;ooner departed out of the chamber, taking her by the hand, "Madam, &s;aid I, this body you have &s;o virtuou&s;ly pre&s;erved, is but a poor recom|pence in con&s;ideration of the danger you un|derwent for my &s;ake, and I fear you will &s;oon grow weary of what &s;o lately you had an e&s;teem for, &s;ince I am become a burthen and torment to my&s;elf, and by con&s;equence in the u&s;e may prove &s;o to you. O Artime&s;ia! thou enjoye&s;t
<PB N="55" REF="033593_0054_0FF797A01802F130">
this wretched and mi&s;erable part of me, the body, when my &s;oul is be&s;towed el&s;ewhere: thou ha&s;t only the &s;hadow of what I am, when another enjoys the &s;ub&s;tance. How, for your &s;ake only, could I wi&s;h love were no mathe|matic point, but would admit of diver&s;ion, that in &s;ome &s;ort I might quit the obligation that I owe you! O cruel parents! you are too kind to procure my di&s;content, and give me no me|dicine to di&s;&s;ipate it.</P>
<P>Poor Artime&s;ia, &s;tood di&s;&s;olved in tears at my di&s;cour&s;e; and, although I could not love, yet I could not continue in&s;en&s;ible of her mi&s;|eries, nor refrain participating in griefs which had their original from me.</P>
<P>Oh! how I was wrecked by my con&s;cience that en&s;uing night, which pre&s;ented my in|gratitude in lively colours! the day approach|ed, but to no other end but to renew my mi&s;e|ries, and make my perfidiou&s;ne&s;s &s;eem the greater. Artime&s;ia, with her kind and &s;weet &s;peeches, and lovely behaviour, did endeavour to divert the melancholy di&s;contents; and this &s;eemed another dagger to pierce my brea&s;t, &s;ince I could make no return for &s;uch a mine of love.</P>
<P>Two days had pa&s;&s;ed away &s;ince my mar|riage with Artime&s;ia, and the third approach|ed, wherein I had given my faith to marry De&s;demona. The remembrance wrought &s;o

&s;trong on my affections, that I intended to write and excu&s;e my&s;elf, le&s;t &s;he might think, by my neglect, I performed that willingly, that I was enforced to do by nece&s;&s;ity; &s;o that taking pen, I wrote and &s;ent her the letter by one that did attend me, of whom I had often made trial of his fidelity; to whom I revealed all the particulars which happened to De&s;de|mona and my&s;elf, and of the continuance of our loves. It is &s;ome comfort in our mi&s;eries when we have a partner in our &s;orrows; one that will participate in our griefs, and to whom with confidence we may reveal our clo&s;e&s;t &s;e|crets. Such an one was this man, who&s;e name ought not to be concealed in this &s;tory; Fide|lio was his name, and it well &s;uited his na|ture. I gave him directions to the garden gate, with charge to remain there till he &s;aw De&s;|demona enter. Away he went to execute what I commanded him, whil&s;t I with an earne&s;t expectation waited an an&s;wer. Fidelio, long expected at la&s;t returned. I no &s;ooner &s;aw him, but I endeavoured to read my de&s;tiny in his looks; but I beheld there a &s;ad omen to attend me. Yet with an earne&s;t de&s;ire, accompanied with timerous apprehen&s;ions, I thus be&s;poke him. Fidelio, do&s;t thou intend to make me linger away in expectation, and &s;ilence with that which being revealed, will kill as &s;oon as know? What is De&s;demona's &s;entence; be

<P>He returned me no an&s;wer; but drawing a letter from his bo&s;om, Sir, &s;aid he, here is that will give a better account of your fortune than my&s;elf; peru&s;e it; after which I will give you a relation of the particulars that happened in this &s;mall time of ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>I had no lei&s;ure for a reply; but taking her letter, ha&s;tily opened it, and read lines, which, while I live, I &s;hall retain and keep in my me|mory.</P>
<P>Her words, like a dart, wounded my very &s;oul. Her innocent &s;weetne&s;s made my infi|delity appear more notorious. Fidelio, to per|fect the grievou&s;ne&s;s of my own crimes, at my reque&s;t related the&s;e few particulars.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid he, according to your order and di|rections, I &s;taid at the garden gate &s;ome time: but it was not long before I &s;aw De&s;demona en|ter, and with her pre&s;ence, like another &s;un, did dazzle the eyes of the beholders. Her attire was negligent and carele&s;s; her countenance
<PB N="58" REF="033593_0057_0FF797A7BAF82D18">
&s;eemed to be clouded with &s;weet melancholy &s;adne&s;s, fitly &s;uited to her thoughts; and tho' all were &s;hadowed and overca&s;t with a veil of grief, yet &s;he &s;eemed charming, &s;ince it did on|ly &s;erve that we might behold her perfections at a nearer di&s;tance, and her virtues more ap|parent and plain; &s;o we may face the &s;un when he is clouded, which in a clear day we dare not approach with our eyes. Such was her grief, it would make one in love with &s;adne&s;s; and &s;uch her ge&s;ture, it would make one wel|come &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Ravi&s;hed with this apparition, I knocked at the gate; which <HI>I</HI> had &s;carce done, but like a godde&s;s &s;he appeared, and fixed her eyes upon my face, perhaps pre&s;aging me to be &s;ome harbinger of ill news; quickly recollecting her|&s;elf, "Sir, &s;aid &s;he, are you not mi&s;taken, have you any bu&s;ine&s;s with any per&s;on here? this is no common way, and it gives me &s;ome cau&s;e of wonder how you came here."</P>

&s;ometimes the ro&s;es of her cheeks were overca&s;t with a lovely red, and &s;uddenly they vani&s;hed and gave way to the lillies to po&s;&s;e&s;s their pla|ces. She ki&s;&s;ed the letter, earne&s;tly enquired of your health, to which, when <HI>I</HI> had given her an an&s;wer, &s;he entreated me to walk into the garden; and &s;o &s;hutting the door, &s;he re|tired her&s;elf into a private arbour, where open|ing the letter, &s;he began to read, whil&s;t <HI>I</HI> &s;eat|ed my&s;elf to behold her.</P>
<P>When on a &s;udden all former &s;igns of joy vani&s;hed; her vi&s;age was overca&s;t with a fatal di&s;turbance; her brea&s;t began to pant, and a &s;hower of tears began to fall from her fair eyes, which hung on her cheeks like pearly dew on a &s;weet &s;melling ro&s;e; &s;uch were her actions, that they would have induced the wild &s;atyrs and fierce bea&s;ts to pity. She &s;hewed nothing of ra&s;hne&s;s in her carriage; but re&s;erving her complaints mildly, till her &s;pirits being over|charged with &s;orrow, for&s;ook her, &s;o that letting your letter fall, &s;he fell into a deadly trance, without any motion, or hopes of life remain|ing. <HI>I</HI> ran ha&s;tily to catch her before &s;he fell, but came too late; &s;o that falling, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on a bed of violets, which &s;eemed to clo&s;e and hang down their heads at this fatal misfortune.</P>
<P>Then it was <HI>I</HI> cur&s;t you for your perfidiou&s;|ne&s;s to &s;o &s;weet a creature. Heaven only knows

the extremes of grief <HI>I</HI> then endured. <HI>I</HI> could not go out of the garden and leave her in that forlorn condition, yet to &s;tay was perilous to my life; but my pity overcame my fear, &s;o that running to a fountain in the garden, and tak|ing cold water in my hand, <HI>I</HI> &s;prinkled it on her face; and taking her lovely body in my arms, <HI>I</HI> &s;oftly began to blow her; &s;o that o|pening her fair eyes, and &s;ending two or three heart-breaking &s;ighs, as a token of her &s;oul's return to her body, which was loath, as it &s;eem|ed, to leave &s;o fair a habitation.</P>
<P>When her &s;en&s;es began to execute their pro|per function and duty, ca&s;ting her eyes on me, taking notice <HI>I</HI> had her in my arms, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I</HI> perceive <HI>I</HI> have been a trouble to you, for which <HI>I</HI> beg your pardon, and intreat you to a&s;&s;i&s;t me to yonder hou&s;e (&s;hewing me a place &s;ituate in the mid&s;t of the garden) &s;o that rai&s;|ing her up, <HI>I</HI> &s;upported her by the arm; fir&s;t taking up your letter, <HI>I</HI> conducted her to the hou&s;e, where &s;he wrote the letter <HI>I</HI> now deliv|ered you, and &s;ealing it, gave it me in the&s;e words, Tell him <HI>I</HI> wi&s;h him happine&s;s and feli|city; for my&s;elf, tell him <HI>I</HI> &s;hall hardly find a|ny but in the grave.

what he had &s;aid to be nothing but ver|ity.

parents when, to pa&s;s away the &s;ummer's even|ing, and to refre&s;h my drooping &s;pirits with the &s;weet air and plea&s;ant &s;hades. I retired my&s;elf, only accompanied with Fidelio, into the &s;ame garden wherein I was fir&s;t &s;urprized with my fair De&s;demona.</P>
<P>Phoebus now ha&s;tened to bathe his &s;weltry &s;teeds in the foaming ocean, and his &s;i&s;ter Luna began to appear &s;o to expel the u&s;urping &s;hades of night, when being comforted by the refre&s;hing &s;weetne&s;s of her cold influences, &s;o that the plea&s;ures I then enjoyed, accom|panied with the thoughts of enjoying De&s;de|mona, made the time &s;eem &s;hort, &s;o that the unexpected hour of ten arrived. Fidelio's intreaties, with the latene&s;s of the evening, could not per&s;uade my return, my mind be|ing employed on thoughts more agreeable. Af|ter the clock had &s;truck eleven I intended to leave the garden, but fir&s;t re&s;olving to vi&s;it the happy place where I re&s;cued my dear De&s;|demona, it was almo&s;t on the &s;troke of twelve ere I arrived there: the night continued fair and clear, and this was the mo&s;t private retir|ing of any in the garden: where I was no &s;ooner arrived, but, to my amazement, be|hold! by the glimmering light of the moon, I &s;aw a beautiful woman: her countenance was pale and wan, dropping pearly tears from her fair eyes, which &s;he wiped off with a handker|chief.

She &s;at on the ground, leaning her head on her fair hand. She &s;eemed wholly a map of &s;orrow, and gave demon&s;trations by her actions that her ge&s;ture could not expre&s;s the torment of her mind. I had no &s;ooner approached near enough to have &s;poken to her, but as one &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;he ha&s;tily takes away her hand, that &s;upported her head; which &s;he had no &s;ooner done, behold from her brea&s;t i&s;&s;ued a crim&s;on gore.

<P>Frighted with the horror of this &s;ight, I &s;tood like an image of &s;tone, not able to go forward, or retire back; when this woful ob|ject came nearer unto me fixing her eyes &s;tead|fa&s;tly on my face; after a while rai&s;ing her right hand, laid it on her wound, which &s;eem|ed to run in purple flood down her brea&s;t, &s;prinkling the gra&s;s with &s;carlet dye.

This &s;udden &s;urpri&s;al, did cowardice all my &s;pirits, &s;o that I had not the confidence nor courage to &s;peak to this pitiful apparition, which once more lifting up her hands to her

I was amaz|ed after its departure, and jealous whether I &s;hould believe my eyes or no; or whether this was a real apparition, or a fiction brought forth by fancy, that had figured &s;uch di&s;mal ideas in my mind. But the &s;ucceeding incidents &s;oon confirmed the effects to be no illu&s;ions; for before I could recollect and rally together my frighted &s;pirits, behold from the thicket hard by me i&s;&s;ued di&s;mal &s;creeches horrible and fear|ful moans, accompanied with uncommon and confu&s;ed voices: the heavens on a &s;udden cov|ered them&s;elves with a &s;able cover, and the moon hid her face under an eclip&s;e. The noi&s;e became yet more loud and terrible, and the re&s;ounding echo of the horrid clamour drew nearer and nearer, and &s;o became more fearful and dreadful. The horizon was cloath|ed with thick dark clouds; from whence pro|ceeded a &s;tormy &s;hower of hail and rain, the wind grew tempe&s;tuous and boi&s;terous, fear|ful &s;la&s;hes of lightning proceeded: after which followed loud and fearful claps of thunder.

<P>"Wretched man, now the reward of thy wickedne&s;s draws near, and thy puni&s;hment is at hand.

<P>I had no &s;ooner ended my letter, but I can|not tell what horrid fate prompted me to the contrary, to go my&s;elf in per&s;on, alledging that my pre&s;ence would procure more in De&s;|demona's brea&s;t, than my letter could. I went accompanied with Fidelio, towards her fath|er's hou&s;e; but we had no &s;ooner, le&s;&s;ened the di&s;tance, but behold I &s;aw a coffin covered with black, adorned with a garland of flowers; the hear&s;e was &s;upported and carried by four young men and &s;ix beautiful maidens accompa|nied them, each holding a part of the hear&s;e|cloth, wherein they did intimate and &s;ilently &s;peak their willingne&s;s to do &s;omething oblig|ing, it being the la&s;t &s;ervice they could per|form to the body of this poor departed virgin. The company were all covered with a fable black, their pace &s;ilent and &s;low, bent towards the

great temple of the city. This &s;ight began to chill my blood: and that which gave &s;u&s;pi|cion to my fears was, becau&s;e I &s;aw, them come out of Phila&s;ter's hou&s;e; to confirm me that I was not in an error, I &s;aw the corp&s;e followed by the old knight and his lady; their countenance and actions declared them to be in the bitterne&s;s of &s;orrow, and plunged in the depth of woe.</P>
<P>I had accompanied them to the temple, had not the earne&s;t de&s;ire I had to be re&s;olved of the wor&s;t prompted me to the contrary, and per&s;uaded me to go to the hou&s;e to be truly &s;atisfied of my fears. We &s;oon came to the door, and having knocked were met by a &s;er|vant of the hou&s;e, who did know me &s;ince I u&s;ed to frequent the hou&s;e; and being acquain|ted with the re&s;pect his lord and lady paid me when they reque&s;ted me to come in. I a&s;ked for the knight and his lady, not taking notice that I had &s;een them; al&s;o for De&s;de|mona; to which he gave me a pitious look, letting drop from his eyes many tears.

melancholy, &s;he &s;ell into de&s;pair, and walking out as if &s;he would recreate her&s;elf in the gar|den, &s;he retired into a hou&s;e of plea&s;ure there privately &s;ituated, where with a fatal dagger &s;he wounds her&s;elf to the heart, and this day, ac|companied with her friends, in a &s;olemn man|ner they perform her ob&s;equies, and convey her body to the temple.</P>
<P>Here he ended&mdash;while my apparition came bleeding fre&s;h in my mind;&mdash;my crimes pre&s;ented them&s;elves in their own colours; and my con&s;cience bid me expect nothing but the fulfilling of murdered Artime&s;ia's &s;en|tence.</P>
<P>I took my farewell, but not without &s;hed|ding tears for the lo&s;s of one whom I &s;o dear|ly loved.&mdash;In this di&s;tre&s;s of mind, I returned home; and about the hour of ten, at night, while repo&s;ing on my bed, &s;uddenly and un|expected, our hou&s;e was &s;urrounded with armed men, my chamber doors broke open, my body &s;eized on, and taken pri&s;oner; being thus &s;urprized, I demanded the cau&s;e, and by what authority they did it? To which one returned me this &s;harp an&s;wer, their authority they had from the king, which I mu&s;t obey, and the occa&s;ion, the death of your late mar|ried wife Artime&s;ia, &s;uppo&s;ed to be poi&s;oned by you; with a &s;u&s;picion which is conceived of you, that you are the author and cau&s;e of

This &s;aid they laid hands on me, and &s;peedily hurried me out of my chamber, to convey me to pri&s;on; but we had not &s;hortened half the way between my fath|er's hou&s;e and the city goal, but by the &s;hine of the moon, we might di&s;cern a troop of hor&s;e, and perceive a &s;mall company of foot, which in a void place of the city began to com|pa&s;s us about, which my guard no &s;ooner de&s;|cried, but they cried out a re&s;cue, a re&s;cue: but their voices were &s;oon &s;topped by the hor&s;e-men which overran them, and the foot|men that bravely a&s;&s;aulted them: &s;o that in a moment I &s;aw my&s;elf free, and bravely mount|ed on a fre&s;h hor&s;e.

the&s;e evils for which you were accu&s;ed fearing you are too much guilty to &s;tand in ju&s;tifica|tion of your&s;elf and your crimes too notorious to abide a trial; and therefore being unwilling to leave you to the mercies and &s;everities of the law, that him&s;elf fir&s;t brought into danger, waits for you at the water-&s;ide, with &s;ome oth|er company.</P>
<P>Being conducted to the ve&s;&s;el, and the wind blowing fair, &s;o that we left Syracu&s;e far a|&s;tern, and a few hours after wholly lo&s;t the &s;ight of the i&s;land of Sicilia; the gale continuing &s;till fair, we gained a ken of the i&s;le of Malta, where we did not land, but continuing our cour&s;e almo&s;t three days gained a view of the main continent of Africa; and about the eve|ning of the third day, we anchored before the mighty city of Carthaga.</P>
<P>Here we landed and provided our&s;elves with all nece&s;&s;aries, as well offen&s;ive as defen&s;ive, and all other things needful, which our &s;o ha&s;ty parting from Syracu&s;e would not permit us to furni&s;h. We lay there one day, and then weighed anchor, and put to &s;ea, where our intentions were to cruize about, in expecta|tions to meet with &s;ome ve&s;&s;els that came lately from Syracu&s;e, of whom we might en|quire tidings of what we all did &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ire to know.</P>
<P>It was now &s;even days &s;ince we parted Sicil|ia,
<PB N="76" REF="033593_0075_0FF797D3805EA290">
and two &s;ince we left the coa&s;t of Africa, about the time of the day when the &s;un begins to decline towards the we&s;t, when a boy &s;tood centinel on the top ma&s;t head &s;uddenly cried out a &s;ail, a &s;ail; being demanded from whence &s;he &s;teered her cour&s;e? he returned an&s;wer from Sicilia. This began to augment the de|&s;ire I had to have news from Syracu&s;e; &s;o that I gave commands to the pilot to &s;teer his cour&s;e to her, which he had no &s;ooner performed, but the boy called out again, &s;aying, prepare for your defence, for this ve&s;&s;el bears to us with all &s;peed for an a&s;&s;ault. He had &s;carce ended the&s;e words but our eyes did give us proof the were fit for a pre&s;ent fight.</P>
<P>This &s;ight cau&s;ed them to forget the con|cernment of others, and to think on nothing &s;o much as to provide for their own &s;afety; yet they agreed with one accord chearfully to make good their defence, and manfully to guard them&s;elves, and me from being captured. We had hardly made our preparations for a re&s;i&s;t|ance, but we &s;aw this ve&s;&s;el with great dexter|ity preparing to board us on the weather &s;ide: their javelins in a moment were ready to grapple with our ve&s;&s;el, in the perform|ance of which we received a brave a&s;&s;ault, and they as gallant repul&s;e. Our archers &s;carce &s;pent an arrow in vain; neither did their's &s;lack their duty. The fight continued
<PB N="77" REF="033593_0076_0FF797D510EECB08">
&s;harp while we lay off the one from the other, but I heard him that &s;eemed to be the captain of the ve&s;&s;el &s;ay the&s;e words to his &s;oldiers, "Arm your&s;elves with courage, noble hearts, and let the king of Sicilia know you are val|ient.

<P>This &s;peech left us no longer in doubt of their bu&s;ine&s;s; and although I e&s;teemed my life &s;carce worth pre&s;erving, yet the great pro|mi&s;e this fellow made of my head made me re|&s;olve not to part with it friendly to my enemies at &s;uch a time when I was in good capacity to defend it.

<P>Now the fight began to be at the highe&s;t, and a great number of men were &s;lain on both &s;ides. This battle was fought till the &s;un be|gan to bid good night to our horizon, yet for|tune had left it doubtful to which &s;ide &s;he &s;hould incline: when we were pre&s;&s;ed by our

enemies, with &s;o much vigour, that my men were forced to retire, whil&s;t they furiou&s;ly mounted our ve&s;&s;el.

As I was de&s;perately braving the utmo&s;t danger, I met and engaged with their commander, &s;o greedily we combated one with another, and with &s;o much de&s;ire endeavoured the ruin of each other, that it was no wonder fortune made ha&s;te to determine the end; many cruel blows we exchanged, till at la&s;t I pu&s;hed my enemy &s;o clo&s;ely, and redoubled my blows with &s;o much violence, that directing a blow which fell on his head with my greate&s;t force, it part|ed in two, and he fell lifele&s;s on the deck.&mdash; Thus he who &s;o confidently di&s;po&s;ed of my head, could not &s;ecure his own from my &s;word.</P>
<P>This &s;ight began to abate the courage of our enemies, and to revive the &s;pirits of my almo&s;t vanqui&s;hed men; for returning with a greater force than at fir&s;t, they made a mighty &s;laughter; and having di&s;patched all tho&s;e in their own ve&s;&s;el, with great &s;peed we boarded our enemies, &s;o that the offen&s;ive were now be|come defen&s;ive, and performed their part &s;o ill in maintaining it that we &s;oon became con+querors

of the other &s;hip, committing all the &s;ouls to the place appointed for their de&s;erts, where the &s;pirits of all men are rewarded ac|cording to their merits. The dead bodies of our men, and al&s;o of our enemies, we ca&s;t overboard into the &s;ea.</P>

<P>Among many that were thus u&s;ed, one of them, whom my men had taken up in their arms ready to ca&s;t him away into the ocean, cried out, "O Sirs! &s;pare me but one mo|ment, and bring me to your commander, to whom I &s;hall relate &s;uch &s;ecrets as he is yet ig|norant of."

the &s;ame who related to me the death of De&s;demona. And from him I learned that the letter I wrote to De&s;demona, and which I unfortunately dropped near her father's hou&s;e, had been found, and delivered to the earl of Palermo; who thereby di&s;covered me to be the murderer of his daughter, and who with a de&s;ign to revenge her death, had cau&s;ed me to be arre&s;ted; but finding I had been re&s;qued by my father, applied to the King, who imme|diately armed and &s;ent ve&s;&s;els in pur&s;uit of me; and that the earl's &s;ervants, and the &s;ervants of Phila&s;ter, had voluntarily gone on board, determined to &s;ecure the author of the calam|ities that had befallen their ma&s;ters. He pro|ceeded no farther, and perceiving him to grow faint by the lo&s;s of blood, I ordered the &s;ur|geons to admini&s;ter the be&s;t relief; but in vain, for he &s;oon expired.</P>

<P>HERE Almerin ended the &s;tory of his life, leaving Or&s;amus and Cynthia in ad|miration and a&s;toni&s;hment; they &s;aw he was pur&s;ued by a divine hand, and that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for him to fly his fate; &s;o that they be|gan to look on their own condition, fearfully apprehending the calamities that might befal them, in being pri&s;oner to one, who being followed by divine vengeance, made all mi&s;er|able that were concerned in any thing that ap|pertained

unto him. Their fears almo&s;t made them de&s;pair but that they did remember Hea|ven doth always a&s;&s;i&s;t the virtuous in their greate&s;t calamities, and is neare&s;t at hand, with remedy and relief, when our mi&s;eries become mo&s;t de&s;perate, and pa&s;t cure.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations di&s;&s;ipated the grief of lovers endured, el&s;e it had been too heavy a burden; for their condition &s;eemed &s;o de&s;pe|rate that only a divine power could relieve them. The relation of Almerin's life, became an addition to their own mi&s;eries, and an aug|mentation of their tears, yet in civilitiy &s;he was enforced to render him thanks for his narra|tion; after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed, and night began to cloath her&s;elf in a &s;able black, &s;o putting a period to their di&s;cour&s;e, Or&s;amus and Almerin each taking their re&s;pective fare|wels of Cynthia, left her to her re&s;t; Or&s;amus retiring to his cabin, and Almerin to give commands to his &s;oldiers, concerning the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Some days pa&s;&s;ed, while they crui&s;ed in ex|pectation of more prizes; In the mean time, Almerin pro&s;ecuted his &s;uit to Cynthia with much eagerne&s;s; &s;till keeping him&s;elf in the bounds of his re&s;pect, until by the return of Cynthia's beauty, his love blew his lu&s;t into a flame, which could not be extingui&s;hed with|out peril to either &s;ide. Love is a pa&s;&s;ion of

all others mo&s;t lovely, until lu&s;t take a moiety, and becomes its rival, then it becomes a very tyrant, and is &s;ubject to the greate&s;t villainy; for where pa&s;&s;ion bears &s;way, there is no admit|tance for rea&s;on.</P>
<P>About nine days had pa&s;&s;ed away, &s;ince they were fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed, when he came very rudely into her cabin, and with much in&s;olence treated her in this manner: Madam, I &s;ee all civilities have been lo&s;t, and you provoke me to de&s;troy all the con&s;iderations that have flowed from that fountain. I have henceforth decreed to &s;eek my &s;atisfaction by other means, &s;o that I allow you until to morrow to frame a re&s;olution, and if that fail to overcome your ob&s;tinacy, I &s;hall know how to oblige you un|to it, in &s;pite of your aver&s;ion. He confirmed this menace with many others; and his actions agreeing thereunto told him to have &s;poke nothing but what he fully determined before in his mind; &s;aying this, he left the cabin with|out the lea&s;t re&s;pect; and in going out, he fortuned to meet Or&s;amus, then going to pay his u&s;ual vi&s;it to Cynthia, and greeting him in his rough language, &s;ir, &s;aid he, remember you are my pri&s;oner; and &s;ince fortune gives you no greater tie over your &s;i&s;ter's affections, that &s;he will not &s;uffer you to gain your free|dom, from henceforth you &s;hall be treated like a &s;lave, or like one that has baffled and deluded
<PB N="84" REF="033593_0083_0FF797E5A87EF180">
me with fal&s;e hopes; henceforth I &s;hall find other ways to compa&s;s my ends, without your interce&s;&s;ion: until to-morrow I have allowed your &s;i&s;ter to comply with my de&s;ires, which if you can perfect you may both yet be hap|py. Ba&s;e man, replied Or&s;amus, do&s;t thou think thy villainy &s;hall always remain unpun|i&s;hed, and that there is no period &s;et on thy wickedne&s;s. This &s;aid, he entered into Cyn|thia's cabin, yet compo&s;ing all that was fierce and terrible in his looks, where he found the object of his felicity bathing in tears. Why the&s;e precious &s;howers, Madam? &s;aid he, wherefore the overflowings of grief? is it be|cau&s;e this villain has &s;o confidently &s;et a time to fini&s;h his de&s;ires? alas! my dear prince&s;s, he does but hurry on his own puni&s;hment, and &s;et an end unto his villainy; fear not the i&s;&s;ue, Madam; but di&s;&s;ipate tho&s;e cruel apprehen|&s;ions; for you &s;hall yet be free.</P>
<P>All the time of this di&s;cour&s;e Or&s;amus re|mained at her feet; but recollecting her &s;pir|its, taking him by the hand, ri&s;e Or&s;amus, &s;aid &s;he, and blame not my griefs &s;ince fortune in|tends to put no period to our misfortunes, nor end to our mi&s;eries; &s;he is become cruel with|out remor&s;e, and pitile&s;s without compa&s;&s;ion; if I think of hope, &s;he &s;oon transforms it into di&s;pair, and if I dare imagine I may be more happy, &s;he &s;oon curbs me in that pre&s;umption.
<PB N="85" REF="033593_0084_0FF797E738BC1028">
If there is no preterminant end &s;et to my mi&s;|fortunes, why &s;hould I expect any longer, and not count death as the la&s;t remedy? then blame not the tears I &s;hed in &s;o woful a ca&s;e, &s;ince &s;ome fall for Or&s;amus, and accompany tho&s;e that drop for Cynthia. Or&s;amus ravi&s;h|ed at this free and uncon&s;trained an&s;wer of Cynthia, and manife&s;tation of her pity, Oh! Madam, &s;aid he, how happy do you make me! a thou&s;and &s;uch lives as mine &s;pent in thy &s;er|vice were but a poor recompence of the lea&s;t of tho&s;e precious tears that you &s;hed: Oh re&s;t contented, my deare&s;t prince&s;s: I am only &s;afe in your &s;ecurity, and happy in your &s;atisfaction. It is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be thus fortunate, and yet be unhappy.</P>
<P>In &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e they pa&s;&s;ed away their lim|ited time, till Almerin, with ha&s;ty &s;teps made towards the cabin door; which was no &s;ooner perceived by Or&s;amus, but he made ready for his entertainment. Cynthia per&s;uaded him from an attempt upon his life: but he return|ed an&s;wer, Cea&s;e, fair &s;oul, and let me alone, middle ways to &s;uch enterprizes are the mo&s;t dangerous.</P>
<P>By this time Almerin came to the cabin door, which was opened on to him by Or&s;amus, at his entrance he &s;uddenly di&s;armed him of his &s;word with &s;uch an impetuous fury, that before he could cry out for help or make the
<PB N="86" REF="033593_0085_0FF797E8D2AF7280">
lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, he ca&s;t him deadly wounded at his feet, "Lie there thou main ob&s;tructor of my quiet, &s;aid he, take the reward of thy villainy in the grave." Hardly was he fallen on the deck but his amazed &s;pirits returned, being ready to give a farewel to the body; which Or&s;amus &s;eeing, made ready to give him another blow, &s;o to make a &s;udden end to that fatal &s;eparation, which Almerin perceiv|ing cried," "Oh, hold your hand! it is e|nough; I feel my &s;oul is ready to take her flight, and my continuance here will be but a few moments. Oh horrible! &s;till beginning and never ending eternity; now I de&s;ire to live becau&s;e I fear to die; yet I would die becau&s;e I would be free from the fear of wor&s;e to come. Oh happy they that &s;o live, that they may be never afraid to die; to &s;uch, death is eternal happine&s;s;&mdash;but mine is&mdash;another voyage&mdash; for my time is at hand, I go away in a mi&s;t I know not how;&mdash;I can &s;ay no more&mdash;farewel." At this he gave up the gho&s;t, to the amaze|ment of Or&s;amus, and to the terror of Cyn|thia.</P>
<P>In a moment the glory of the day was over|ca&s;t with black clouds, the wind grew boi&s;ter|ous, and the &s;eas turbulent, the re&s;ounding echo of the thundering claps were terrible to the hearers; fla&s;hes of lightning made the &s;hip &s;eem on fire, with &s;torms of hail and rain; &s;o

that the men made towards Cynthia's cabin, to give notice to their captain to have his ad|vi&s;e; when behold they were amazed at the di&s;mal object pre&s;ented to their eyes; they &s;aw him wallowing in his own blood at the entrance of the cabin.</P>
<P>This &s;ight was followed with a loud and bit|ter cry, with lamentations, of many voices; &s;till the &s;torm continued, and their confu&s;ion increa&s;ed until at la&s;t recollecting their di&s;trac|tion, they agreed with one con&s;ent to make good their revenge upon Or&s;amus, who they doubted not had been the murderer of their captain; part they appointed to manage the &s;hip in the &s;torm, while the re&s;t went to &s;acri|fice his blood to the gho&s;t of their &s;lain com|mander. Their re&s;olution was an&s;werable to their de&s;ign: for the lo&s;s of their captain whom they loved &s;o entirely, and in whom they built their future fortunes, had rai&s;ed their cholor to &s;uch a height, that nothing could allay it but his death. This was made manife&s;t in their fierce a&s;&s;ault, which was by Or&s;amus as brave|ly repul&s;ed; for he had gotten this advantage, that defending him&s;elf at the entrance of the cabin door, but one at a time could endanger or hurt him. The combat continued hot on both &s;ides, Or&s;amus, for the &s;afety of his dear|e&s;t Cynthia, and the pirates their revenge.&mdash; Three of the pirates Or&s;amus had &s;ent to ac|company
<PB N="88" REF="033593_0087_0FF797EED063D4D0">
their captain, neither did he him&s;elf e&s;cape without wounds. Things were thus &s;tated when the tempe&s;t began to a&s;&s;uage, and one from the foreca&s;tle began to cry out, A Sail, a Sail. This &s;ummons per&s;uaded them to defer their revenge for a time, &s;o that of that great number that a&s;&s;ailed him, &s;ix only &s;taid as a guard to &s;ecure him, fearing, &s;hould they engage, he might i&s;&s;ue forth and join with the enemy, to their no &s;mall di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>The &s;hip drew nearer, making towards them with full &s;ails before their preparations were in readine&s;s for defence, they were &s;alut|ed with &s;howers of arrows that &s;eemed to dar|ken the &s;ky; in a few moments they came to a clo&s;er combat and grapple with their &s;hip; then the fight began bloody, and cruel de&s;pair made the pirates courageous, &s;o that twice they repul&s;ed them with no &s;mall lo&s;s: in the third a&s;&s;ault they were wor&s;ted and their ene|mies&punc; taking advantage of their retreat, &s;lew all, leaving not a man alive, tho&s;e that guard|ed Or&s;amus were fled away, and e&s;caped his hands, but it was only to fall by others; &s;ome that were forwarde&s;t for plunder and &s;poil, would have entered Or&s;amus's cabin, but their lives paid the forfeit of their folly: this occa|&s;ioned another bickering and drew mo&s;t part of the conquerors together to behold a re&s;i&s;t|ance &s;o bravely maintained by one man, where

eight lay wallowing in their blood yet he made good his defence, thus he continued triumph|ing in their deaths, while the victorious captain that had boarded the &s;hip was a &s;pectator, and pitying that &s;o much bravery &s;hould wither in the bud, he commanded his men to leave a&s;&s;ail|ing him, and drawing &s;omething nearer, Gal|lant man, &s;aid he, your courage has gained an e&s;teem in the brea&s;t of your enemy; cea&s;e this conte&s;t, and I promi&s;e, you life and liberty.</P>
<P>Your offer is noble, replied Or&s;amus, nor could it flow but from a brea&s;t truly generous; it is not only again&s;t your men I have made this re&s;i&s;tance, but again&s;t the whole &s;trength of this &s;hip before your valour &s;ubdued it; the captain lies here a &s;acrifice, &s;lain by my hand; and nothing could have pre&s;erved my life, had not providence directed you hither; yet being my pre&s;erver, I dare not deliver my|&s;elf on the&s;e terms; not that I doubt the per|formance of your promi&s;e, but I have here within this cabin one who&s;e &s;afety if I cannot &s;ecure, I &s;hall little value my own. If you plea&s;e to let us both &s;hare alike in your bounty, and promi&s;e to include us both in that noble offer of life and liberty, I will &s;ubmit my&s;elf to your protection; if not, I am ready to make good my defence, with the lo&s;s of that life I &s;hall not e&s;teem, without the entire perform|ance of tho&s;e articles. Saying this, he put
<PB N="90" REF="033593_0089_0FF797F1F34F0280">
him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence. Hold &s;aid the captain I will fulfill all thy reque&s;t; in the King of Kent's name, my royal ma&s;ter, I plight thee my faith. Or&s;amus remained amazed at this an&s;wer, and after &s;ome revolutions in his &s;pirit, he replied, ha, King of Kent &s;aid you' come and fini&s;h what you have begun; for I will never live to &s;ee in another's cu&s;tody what is entirely due to my merit.</P>
<P>Scarce had he uttered the&s;e words when an aged man made through the crowd towards him, and with extacy of joy exclaimed, My noble lord Or&s;amus, living and found here! Heavens, you have &s;atisfied my tedious expect|ations: and pau&s;ing a while with admiration he continued his di&s;cour&s;e; Sir, I am not &s;o much lo&s;t unto your memory, but you may remember one Willifred. At this Or&s;amus recollecting him&s;elf, crying out, my dear fath|er, Oh come into this fatal place that I may have happine&s;s in death to die in the defence of two per&s;ons that &s;hare my &s;oul betwixt them. Oh &s;ir! replied the old man, talk not of death, we come forth in &s;earch of you only for &s;afety; that I make all this evident unto you, cea&s;e your admiration for a time. This &s;aid, and all continuing &s;ilent, he proceeded as follows.</P>
<P>O&s;wald, that famous king of the Northum|bers, had a brother named O&s;wain the only

When that fatal bat|tle of Ma&s;terfield was &s;ought by king Penda, the tyrant of Mercia, again&s;t your uncle O&s;|wald, king of the Northumbers, in which field he was &s;lain, it was uncertain whether O&s;wain your father, or your elder brother Egfrid had ended their lives at the moment; as &s;oon as tidings were brought of their di&s;mal overthrow, I fled with you, being as then about ten years old, unto the next port town, where I got &s;hip|ping and e&s;caped to find a more &s;ecure &s;anctu|ary in another country than our own; but I kept you from the knowledge of your&s;elf; pardon, it was my love that erred, for I did conclude a di&s;covery would be prejudicial.&mdash; While we were &s;ailing on the ocean as you well remember, their aro&s;e &s;uch a tempe&s;t, that the &s;kill of the mariners was u&s;ed in vain; &s;o be|ing left to the mercy of the &s;ea we were con|veyed to unknown parts: and about the dawn|ing of the &s;econd day, we di&s;cerned land, and before we had time to recollect upon what &s;hore we were ca&s;t, we grounded on a rock &s;o that the &s;hip bur&s;t into a thou&s;and pieces. The little time I had left I did con&s;ider of your &s;afety, &s;o that tying two ca&s;ks together and &s;ee|ing

Some time after your father recov|ered and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his brother's king|dom, and after I had made a &s;trict enquiry a|bout the part where I conceived you were lan|ded and not finding you, I imagined you had paid your life as a tribute unto the unmerciful waves; &s;o that I returned home &s;orrowful into my own country, and made this relation unto your father, who bitterly lamented your lo&s;s; but time at la&s;t put your memory into oblivi|on, when we con&s;idered you were not among the living.</P>
<P>Some years had added them&s;elves unto the age of time when &s;ame proclaimed in our own country the excellent beauty of Cynthia, daugh|ter to the king of Kent; &s;o much did the re|port of this &s;eize your brother Egfrid's affect|ions, as he de&s;ired his father to treat of an al|liance with the king of Kent by a marriage with his daughter.&mdash;His father, that after the report of your death, did prize him as the ap|ple of his eye, unwilling to cro&s;s affection in a cau&s;e &s;o ju&s;t, immediately accorded with his de&s;ires and cho&s;e me for that emba&s;&s;age&punc; &s;o

<P>"Sir, &s;ome few years ago, when I enjoyed my deare&s;t Cynthia, for now &s;he is not; or if &s;he be, is not to me: in a plea&s;ant morning, before Sol had ca&s;t her rays from the moun|tain tops, &s;he aro&s;e to enjoy the variety of the plea&s;ant &s;pring, which Flora had cloathed in her choice&s;t garb; the pearly dew did yet hang on the &s;weet dama&s;k ro&s;es, and the infant blo&s;&s;om ca&s;t forth a plea&s;ant favour; the wild chori&s;ters of the wood made the vallies ring with echo of their delightful notes; while her contemplation was taken up on the mu&s;ing of the&s;e rarities, her curio&s;ity had brought her to a little path, which led towards the &s;ea, which was not far from the place where &s;he was; &s;traying farther, and ca&s;ting her eyes on the o|cean, they encountered with an object that at once excited her admiration and pity; &s;he &s;aw a youth about her age, that had &s;ecured him|&s;elf on two ca&s;ks, and with his utmo&s;t &s;kill en|deavoured to gain &s;hore; compa&s;&s;ion is never wanting in &s;o tender a brea&s;t, nor was it ab&s;ent from hers; &s;he commanded tho&s;e men that

attended with all expedition to make off and &s;ave his life, and bring him unto her, having more timerous apprehen&s;ions of his &s;afety than at that time needed. Her commands were exactly obeyed, &s;o that by their indu&s;try in a few moments they &s;ecured him a&s;hore, and weak and feeble as he was pre&s;ented him be|fore Cynthia. I remember I was walking in my palace garden when they pre&s;ented him unto me: Lo here, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, taking the youth by the hand with a &s;mile, &s;weetly inno|cent, &s;ee how fortunate I have been to day by my early ri&s;ing, to be the pre&s;erver of this pretty lad, which, with your con&s;ent, I would have to attend on me &s;ince it is his de|&s;ire, to &s;pend his life, &s;o happily pre&s;erved, in my &s;ervice. With this &s;he related where, and how he came into her hands; I &s;taid &s;ometime for an an&s;wer, contemplating his behaviour, and &s;weet becoming graces; me|thought I &s;aw &s;omething in him of maje&s;ty. I que&s;tioned him of his name and country, to which he gave me this an&s;wer, Sir, my name is Or&s;amus, my father is an aged old man, who I fear peri&s;hed in the late &s;torm; my country is far hence, in parts unknown to me; and being &s;hipwrecked in the late tempe&s;t, he &s;ecured my &s;afety upon two ca&s;ks; many hours I continued on the waves uncertain of life, until I was ca&s;t upon this happy &s;hore,

and re&s;cued from the jaws of Neptune, by this fair divinity, in whole &s;ervice I &s;hould be too happy were I a&s;&s;ured of my dear father's &s;afety. At the period of his di&s;cour&s;e he let fall a &s;hower of tears to the memory of &s;o near a lo&s;s.

mu&s;ic, in which art he was excellent; and while &s;he &s;lept he would remain a careful cen|tinel. The prince&s;s, young as &s;he was, did not bury tho&s;e &s;ervices in oblivion, but rated them at their true value in her brea&s;t, rewarding all with a grand e&s;teem, which was received by him as a reward of all his merits; he could &s;o &s;weeten his di&s;cour&s;e and action to &s;o near a &s;ympathy, his conver&s;ation being &s;o charming and agreeable, that Cynthia was never &s;atisfied when he was ab&s;ent; as his years increa&s;ed, he bent his delight to manly exerci&s;es, &s;o that ma|ny times his gallant deportment in publick &s;pec|tacles drew admiration from all that did behold him.</P>
<P>"His affairs &s;tood thus in court, when my land was &s;uddenly invaded by Cavaline, King of the We&s;t-Saxons; I rai&s;ed an army to op|po&s;e him, and &s;et forward to meet him; when this young novice, fired with hopes of action, to make trial of his valour, taking opportunity when the prince&s;s was alone, he acco&s;ted her in this manner: "Madam, I am too happy, in the felicity you have rai&s;ed me to in being your &s;ervant; but now opportunity pre&s;ents what perchance fortune may never offer a|gain; your country is invaded by enemies, and I de&s;ire your good leave to accompany your father in this expedition, again&s;t tho&s;e Pagans that dare to commit &s;o great a &s;acrilege;&mdash;

where, in the field of honor, I may purcha&s;e trophies that may rai&s;e me to de&s;erve that e&s;teem you have for me." Cynthia, having a while con&s;idered of his reque&s;t, with an unu&s;ual kindne&s;s, made this reply. "Yes, Or&s;amus, you have my free leave to go: nor can I tru&s;t you better than with my father; yet it is no &s;mall hopes I promi&s;e my&s;elf, from the&s;e early beginnings of your bravery; go then, and be happy, for you &s;hall never want the prayers of your mi&s;tre&s;s." This &s;aid, he attended her to my chamber, where &s;he made known his re&s;olution unto me; nor could I di&s;approve the gallantry of his mind, but commending his forwardne&s;s, gave him con|&s;ent, ordering him always to be near my per|&s;on.</P>
<P>"We marched forward by u&s;ual journies, to hinder the enemies foraging in the country, until at la&s;t we encamped upon a large plain, on the frontiers of my kingdom; here we took the advantage of our ground, and bade the enemy battle; it was fir&s;t begun by the fore|runners of our armies, but at la&s;t our main body engaged, and the fight became bloody on both &s;ides; victory as yet remained doubt|ful to which &s;ide &s;he would incline; at la&s;t, by a violent charge of the enemy, my ranks were broken, my main battle di&s;ordered, and, in &s;pite of my guard I was taken pri&s;oner. This
<PB N="98" REF="033593_0097_0FF79804D3C14810">
was no &s;ooner under&s;tood by Or&s;amus, but, like a young Mars, he ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the throng, dealing blows with &s;o much bravery, that he &s;oon redeemed me, and in &s;hort we became ma&s;ters of the field.</P>
<P>"But it fortuned &s;oon after, I became the di&s;turber of his quiet, and chief occa&s;ion that he left my court. It fell out thus; the Ea&s;t Angles king, my adjoining neighbour, a&s;ked Cynthia in marriage for his &s;on Cordelio; my council advi&s;ed me to grant his reque&s;t; I con|de&s;cended to their advice, and concluded the marriage with his amba&s;&s;adors, telling them I would celebrate their nuptials in Doroborino: the Amba&s;&s;adors returned home, and in a few days after, Cordelio arrived with a great train. The day was appointed to join their hands, all nece&s;&s;aries provided; yet, by a turn of fortune, it came to no effect.</P>
<P>"After this contract of marriage Or&s;amus became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with unu&s;ual melancholy! he &s;ought out &s;olitary places wherein to &s;pend his time; a mortal &s;adne&s;s was charactered in all the features of his face: the whole court concerned them in his misfortunes, and my|&s;elf was not the lea&s;t; I often times demanded of him from whence this change did ari&s;e, but he never yielded me any account. This was &s;oon taken notice of by Cynthia, &s;o that being with him alone in the garden walks, How

now, Or&s;amus, &s;aid &s;he, why the&s;e &s;ighs? wherefore is your countenance changed? why have you let your&s;elf fall into a di&s;temper below the knowledge of your mi&s;tre&s;s? reveal it, that if po&s;&s;ible I may procure a remedy.&mdash; Yes, &s;aid Or&s;amus, it is only you can yield a remedy; you made me happy only to be un|fortunate: Oh that I had been buried in the raging ocean! I &s;hould have found a re&s;ting place in Elizium, and not have died by a &s;econd death. Oh Madam! continued he, re&s;olve me, mu&s;t you be married? Yes, replied Cyn|thia, it is &s;o decreed: then farewel hopes, con|tinued Or&s;amus; now, Madam, you have pro|vided a remedy, death and de&s;pair will &s;oon give period to my life; but becau&s;e I will ac|cord with your de&s;ires, that your di&s;plea&s;ure may ha&s;ten on the death I &s;o much de&s;ire, know, from the moment you pre&s;erved my life, until this time, I have nouri&s;hed &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for your virtues, as will follow my a&s;h|es to the grave. Seven long years are pa&s;t &s;ince I have concealed this a &s;ecret in my bo&s;om; the &s;ummer's &s;corching heat, nor the tedious winter nights, could never work the lea&s;t change; it was daily nouri&s;hed by your good|ne&s;s, although innocently, until it came to its full growth; whil&s;t there was the lea&s;t hope it thrived nor did I ever complain; but to have hope torn up by the roots, to be confined nev|er

to &s;ee you more, is a cruelty that cannot be borne. Here he continued &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Cynthia remained a&s;toni&s;hed at his di&s;cour&s;e; but at la&s;t recovering that a&s;&s;urance &s;he had lo&s;t the time of his di&s;cour&s;e. "Or&s;a|mus? (replied &s;he) is it thus you pay your re&s;|pects unto me? dare you rai&s;e your ambition to the daughter of a king? or could you imag|ine I would own your preten&s;ions? I am &s;orry my e&s;teem &s;hould be thus le&s;&s;ened by your fol|ly; or if my intentions or inclinations could lean that way, it is impo&s;&s;ible my father &s;hould ever con&s;ent, who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure I would not gain to obtain the deare&s;t good: to put an end to tho&s;e dangers that this may occa&s;ion for the future, I de&s;ire you from henceforth to avoid my pre&s;ence, &s;ince there is only this mean left to cure your malady; while I re&s;train tho&s;e in|nocent familiarities that have di&s;turbed your quiet." Oh Madam! &s;aid Or&s;amus, falling on his knees, mitigate your di&s;plea&s;ure&mdash;there wanted only this to make me wretched. It is decreed, replied Cynthia, and it behoves you not to di&s;pute it. Then be it &s;o, &s;aid Or&s;a|mus, to thy cruel &s;entence will I &s;ubmit, and henceforth avoid thy pre&s;ence, however fatal to me may be the &s;eparation from her who, thro' pity, pre&s;erved my life: may my ab&s;ence free you from the danger of your father's di&s;plea&s;|ure;&mdash;and if in death I &s;till retain your pity,
<PB N="101" REF="033593_0100_0FF7980A054741E0">
then &s;hall my gho&s;t re&s;t quiet in the grave.&mdash; He bowed, and left the room.</P>
<P>The ab&s;ence of Or&s;amus, &s;oon produced great effects in the brea&s;t of Cynthia; di&s;con|tent &s;eated her&s;elf on her brow, the carnation of her cheeks began to abate, and the lillies be|gan to po&s;&s;e&s;s their places; having demanded the rea&s;on of tho&s;e &s;udden effects, &s;he inform|ed me of the particulars that had fallen out be|twixt Or&s;amus and her&s;elf, and the occa&s;ion of his ab&s;ence. Sir, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ee the re&s;olution of this unfortunate youth occa&s;ioned by one ha&s;|ty word; which I fear will de&s;troy what I &s;o happily pre&s;erved, although his audacious re|vealing of his love were an offence, it was not of that degree to call his life in que&s;tion. Shall I tell you, from whom I do not conceal my greate&s;t &s;ecrets; had Or&s;amus's love been au|thori&s;ed by your free con&s;ent, I would have cho|&s;en him out of the &s;tock of mankind; nor can I much offend in loving one that has been the pre&s;erver of your life and kingdom.</P>
<P>I could not much gain&s;ay, what &s;he had &s;aid, for Or&s;amus's virtues were &s;o well grounded in my brea&s;t, that oftentimes I have had thot's to his advantage, tending that way; but, as things were now &s;tated, I dur&s;t not make my concerns known unto Cynthia. The marriage day drew near, and Cordelio waited the con|firmation of his nuptials, &s;o that I could not go
<PB N="102" REF="033593_0101_0FF7980C748DFEA8">
back from promi&s;e without provoking the Ea&s;t Angles King to be my enemy. This con&s;id|eration cau&s;ed me to cloud my countenance with a frown: Fy, Cynthia, replied I, forget this man, one of &s;o low condition; were his birth any ways corre&s;pondent to thine, I think I &s;hould have accorded with thy de&s;ires, had I known it before this contract with Cordelio; but this has proceeded &s;o far, that the deferring of it would endanger my whole kingdom.&mdash; Bani&s;h this mi&s;erable man from thy memory, and obey the commands of thy father and king. She made no reply, but with a low &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to con&s;ent with what I de&s;ired, and left me. After her departure, I &s;ent &s;pies throughout my kingdom to &s;earch for Or&s;a|mus, and bring him back: my di&s;contents came little &s;hort of Cynthia's, for I could not endure the ab&s;ence of him to who&s;e valour I was &s;o much obliged. My &s;ervants at length returned without bringing the lea&s;t intelligence of Or&s;amus; this added fre&s;h grief to Cyn|thia; and &s;hunning tho&s;e amu&s;ements which might have di&s;pelled her melancholy, &s;he was &s;oon reduced to an object of compa&s;&s;ion. I beheld this vici&s;&s;itude with &s;orrow, and gladly would have procured a remedy. The day of marriage fa&s;t approached, and being unwilling at &s;uch a time &s;he &s;hould be wholly made up of &s;orrow, I cau&s;ed a &s;tately banquet
<PB N="103" REF="033593_0102_0FF7980E0910A5F0">
to be prepared in my garden adjoining the &s;ea environed by an unfrequented wood. It was here I recreated my&s;elf when my bu&s;ine&s;s at court would permit my ab&s;ence; and thither I came with Cynthia, attended by Cordelio and a numerous train. We had ended our ban|quet, and &s;eparated to participate of various plea&s;ures. Cordelio remained with me, and Cynthia, accompanied by her u&s;ual attendants, directed her walk to that part of the garden a|butting the &s;ea; as &s;he approached the bounds of the garden &s;he cautioned her &s;ervants to keep at a di&s;tance: the&s;e commands were com|mon, and always obeyed. She had retired an hour, when becoming anxious for her &s;afety, they ventured to break her commands, and re&s;olved to follow her into the wood: but bet|ter rea&s;on induced them fir&s;t to give me notice, as the turnings were &s;o intricate, that, being once entered, they might &s;ooner lo&s;e them&s;elves than recover their ab&s;ent mi&s;tre&s;s. We then di&s;per&s;ed into all parts of the wood; &s;carce a thicket was left untraced; night approached, and we had almo&s;t de&s;paired of finding her, when it was Cordelio's fortune to di&s;cover her &s;itting alone. He had but ju&s;t &s;eated him&s;elf by her &s;ide, when Or&s;amus i&s;&s;ued from a neigh|boring thicket and ca&s;t him&s;elf at her feet. So changed was his countenance, that he remain|ed unknown to Cynthia until he complained
<PB N="104" REF="033593_0103_0FF7980FCB436C40">
of her cruelty. Amazed at his &s;ad appearance, &s;he was unable to reply. He became de&s;pe|rate; drew his &s;word, and re&s;olved to &s;acrifice his own life to his love, and the life of Cordel|io to his revenge. Cordelio was falling a &s;ac|rifice, when his attendants flew to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; they in&s;tantly a&s;&s;aulted him, and altho' by his bravery he &s;lew five of the &s;toute&s;t, yet no doubt they would have put a period to his life, had not a &s;trange turn of fortune pre&s;erv|ed him&mdash;From a &s;mall creek i&s;&s;ued &s;ixteen pi|rates, at the &s;ight of which they that a&s;&s;aulted Or&s;amus fled; but he made good his defence again&s;t them. Too late I had news of this, for when I came to the place, nothing was to be &s;een but half a &s;core of men lying dead on the ground. Among tho&s;e there was one who began to recover, and by a&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;oon brought to his &s;en&s;es, to whom I promi&s;ed life, on condition that he gave me a true relation what they were: He began as followeth:</P>
<P>My country is the Ocean, and the command|er of the&s;e men with whom I came a &s;hore is Almerin the famous rover; under his conduct 16 of us came a&s;hore, and were bravely repul&s;|ed by one &s;ingle man, who made good his de|fence again&s;t us all, for the pre&s;erving of a lady who lay &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the ground; three of my companions be&s;ides my&s;elf lay grovling in their blood at his feet, which &s;ight incen&s;ed Alme|rin
<PB N="105" REF="033593_0104_0FF798125D21A828">
to a &s;peedy revenge, that they ru&s;hed up|on him with &s;uch force that it &s;eemed impo&s;|&s;ible he &s;hould make any longer re&s;i&s;tance; in fine, they &s;eized him, and conveyed both him and the lady aboard our ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Scarce had he uttered the&s;e words, when ca&s;ting my eyes towards the Ocean I beheld the &s;hip that contained all my worldly joys, going before the wind with full &s;ails. I gave orders to &s;everal ve&s;&s;els to follow this pirate; but all things agreed to further his e&s;cape. The night became exceeding dark, and there aro&s;e a mighty &s;torm, &s;o that he was conveyed to un|known parts, far from my own country. This, Sir, is one rea&s;on I cannot accord with your ma&s;ter's de&s;ires; and the other is, were &s;he here I could not without breach of honor break my promi&s;e to Cordelio."</P>
<P>Here, continued Willifred, the king ended his &s;tory, which I hearkened unto with a&s;ton|i&s;hment; at la&s;t recollecting my &s;pirits, Sir, replied I, before I proceed, tell me one thing truly, I &s;ee you prize Or&s;amus's virtues at their full value, &s;hould his birth be as illu&s;trious as his virtues, would you deny him your daught|er in marriage. Would I? replied the king&mdash; could I be &s;o fortunate, his per&s;on and merits, would be the fir&s;t to gain my brea&s;t. I was much &s;atisfied at the freene&s;s of his di&s;cour&s;e, and returned to him this an&s;wer, Know, Sir,
<PB N="106" REF="033593_0105_0FF79815D1B737A0">
Or&s;amus is of royal blood, &s;econd &s;on to my ma&s;ter, the king of Northumbers, by ca&s;ualty &s;hipwrecked on your coa&s;t; I gave a relation of what already you have heard, and told him I would return to my ma&s;ter, to give him in|telligence of tho&s;e many &s;trange adventures, from whence I would &s;et out with a &s;hip well manned in pur&s;uit of the pirate.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed at what I propo&s;|ed, and &s;peedily fitted out the &s;hip we are now in, di&s;patching this noble commander to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the recovery of his daughter. The wind blowing fair we put off from &s;hore, and gave farewel to the king. In fine, we had a nim|ble pa&s;&s;age into our own country, where I land|ed, and gave your father an account of your fate. Your father rejoiced much at the hope of your &s;afety, according with the king of Kent in all his reque&s;ts; for they were equally con|cerned in each others di&s;a&s;ters.</P>
<P>Hardly were commands i&s;&s;ued for a prepa|ration, but a &s;hip that came into our harbour brought news that Almerin was off at &s;ea, and that they narrowly e&s;caped his hands; this opportunity would admit of no delay, which this brave captain conceiving, ha&s;tened our departure; in a moment the &s;hip was &s;trongly manned with our own men, who freely offered their lives to redeem their prince; my&s;elf, tho' age would have excu&s;ed it, accompanied
<PB N="107" REF="033593_0106_0FF79817617DBEE8">
this noble man, the thought of your welfare extingui&s;hing the imagination of my own dan|ger; thus we made off to &s;ea, accompanied with one &s;hip more, which was &s;evered from us in the late &s;torm. Four days had not yet pa&s;&s;|ed &s;ince I left my own country, in which time heaven had been &s;o kind to make us your pre|&s;erver! Now what remains but that we return to your father.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e being ended, Or&s;amus and Cynthia left the cabin, who&s;e beauty was the admiration of all that did behold her, and claimed obedience as a tribute from all hearts; and the re&s;pects there &s;hewn her were not in|ferior to tho&s;e &s;he received in her father's court. After a &s;hort con&s;ultation, it was re&s;ol|ved to &s;tear for Northumberland; the &s;hips were then cleared; Almerin's body, with the re&s;t, was committed to the waves, and this was the mi&s;erable end of that wretched man.</P>
<P>A fair and plea&s;ant gale &s;oon wa&s;ted them to their native &s;hore, where being arrived, they made them&s;elves known to the king, who was almo&s;t ravi&s;hed with joy at the &s;ight of his long lo&s;t &s;on; his brother care&s;&s;ed him, his friends welcomed him, nor could there be a parallel to his entertainment. Cynthia had &s;uch re&s;pects paid her as were peculiar to &s;o rare a creature; &s;uch deep impre&s;&s;ions can virtue make on no|ble minds. Becau&s;e they would not di&s;turb
<PB N="108" REF="033593_0107_0FF7981909CA8FB0">
their happine&s;s by a &s;udden journey, they &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the king of Kent, to certify him of his daughter's &s;afety, and to give him advice, that in a few days time O&s;win would be with him in Doroborina, accompanied with his too &s;ons, and his fair daughter Cynthia, to celebrate Or&s;amus's nuptials; the me&s;&s;enger was received with all joy and re&s;pect, prepa|rations were made on all parts for a triumphant entrance; at the time limited O&s;win came and was received with acclamations of joy. They had a &s;plendid attendance to the palace, where Cynthia threw her&s;elf into her father's arms, and they embraced with tears of mutual glad|ne&s;s. The marriage was deferred no longer than the next week, when Or&s;amus received Cynthia from the hands of the old king, as the be&s;t reward of his &s;ervices and valour. They lived in felicity, and, as a cruel winter makes a lovely &s;pring, &s;o the adver&s;ity through which they had pa&s;&s;ed, added to their new &s;cenes of plea&s;ure.</P>
