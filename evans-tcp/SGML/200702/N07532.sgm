<P>&mdash; And to the Blood of Sprinkling, that &s;peaketh better Things than that of ABEL.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is well known to this numerous Audience, that the &s;ad and melancholy Occa&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embling this Day, is, to &s;ee the Execu|tion of Ju&s;tice upon the condemned <HI>Cri|minal</HI> here pre&s;ent: And, as our De&s;ign in coming into the Hou&s;e of GOD this Morning, is, to give <HI>Him</HI> one more Opportunity of hearing a Me&s;&s;age from the Oracles of GOD, and &s;o from the Throne of Grace; as al&s;o to pre&s;ent our united Supplications to the ALMIGHTY in his Behalf, and to hear what GOD the LORD has to &s;ay unto us upon this &s;olemn and affecting Occa&s;ion,</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore addre&s;s my&s;elf immediately to the Con&s;ideration of &s;ome Things, &s;uitable, both to employ the Thoughts of the <HI>Criminal,</HI> (who&s;e immortal Soul, before Night, will be re|quired of him) and al&s;o to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Meditations, and animate the Devotion of us all.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009616_0004_0F77458FB3223D90">But, who of us can think of the guilty Cau&s;e of this general Concour&s;e, without feeling our Heart &s;truck, and deeply too, with the different Sen&s;ations of &s;evere <HI>Indignation,</HI> and tender <HI>Com|pa&s;&s;ion?</HI> Indignation, at the black and horrid <HI>Crime</HI>; but Compa&s;&s;ion to the abandon'd <HI>Crimi|nal?</HI> For we ought to pity his Per&s;on, tho' he is ju&s;tly condemn'd to Death; and to pray for the Salvation of his immortal Soul, tho' we greatly abhor his Action.</P>
<P>However; all our Pity, our Prayers and be&s;t Endeavours to recover him to a thoro' Repen|tance, and to the Mercy and Favour of GOD, would be ab&s;olutely vain and without the lea&s;t Hopes of Succe&s;s, were it not for the Con&s;ideration of, <HI>The</HI> BLOOD <HI>of</HI> SPRINKLING, <HI>that &s;peaketh bet|ter Things than the</HI> BLOOD <HI>of</HI> ABEL. Here is the Encouragement we have, to per&s;evere in u&s;ing Means with <HI>Him,</HI> or indeed with any other Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or: And &s;ince it has plea&s;ed the infi|nitely merciful GOD to provide this &s;overeign and powerful Remedy, for the Salvation of Sin|ners that have de&s;troy'd them&s;elves; therefore, as long as Life and Breath la&s;t, and as long as the Go&s;pel &s;ounds in our Ears, we &s;hould be &s;triving, u&s;ing Means, &amp;c. Becau&s;e, &s;o long as we are favoured with Life, Rea&s;on, and the Go&s;pel, we have the rich Ble&s;&s;ings of Pardon and Re|demption held forth to us all, and freely offered to our Acceptance, thro' the virtuous Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Neverthele&s;s; our Malady is to be &s;et before us, antecedent to our Remedy; for <HI>the whole need not a Phi&s;ician, but they that are &s;ick;</HI> and the Words of Scripture I have now read to you, as they refer to the <HI>Blood of Abel</HI> and the
<PB N="7" REF="009616_0005_0F77459074B19BD8">
<HI>Blood of Je&s;us,</HI> (in which Light I con&s;ider them) do furni&s;h us with &s;uitable Matter, to an&s;wer both the&s;e Ends in <HI>general,</HI> and to an&s;wer the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion in <HI>particular</HI>; for,</P>
<P>I think, we can hardly mention, or hear men|tioned, the <HI>Blood of</HI> ABEL, without bringing a|fre&s;h to our Minds, the horrible Murder that was perpetrated upon him by his Brother <HI>Cain</HI>; which Murder of <HI>Abel,</HI> as it was committed in|tirely without a great many of tho&s;e external Cau&s;es, Provocations, and Motives, that have oftentimes embolden'd, and hurried on other au|dacious Sinners to the like guilty Act; on this Account, it &s;eems nearly related, and a good deal &s;imilar to the Murder we now deplore, and for which the Murderer is &s;oon to be executed.</P>
<P>Among the various Kinds, or Denominations of Homicide or Man-killing, I can think of but three Things that will free the Agent from the Guilt of innocent Blood in &s;uch In&s;tances, viz. either profound <HI>Ignorance,</HI> or what is called <HI>Ac|cident,</HI> or <HI>Self-Defence;</HI> in all which Ca&s;es, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the <HI>Actor</HI> may be innocent, and accordingly Provi&s;ion is made for his Safety, both in the Law of GOD and <HI>Man.</HI> The&s;e Ca&s;es excepted, there is no Excu&s;e for the Murderer; he mu&s;t die, or the Guilt of Blood will lay upon the Community.</P>
<P>As for Suicide (or Self-Murder) which is the wor&s;t of all; nothing but <HI>Ignorance,</HI> or <HI>Accident</HI> leave us any Ground to hope favorably of the Self-De&s;troyer. But as this is not the Crime un|der Con&s;ideration, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing about it: Neither &s;hall I in&s;i&s;t or enlarge upon the <HI>Eviden|ces,</HI> which prove, that <HI>Murder</HI> is a Sin of the
<PB N="8" REF="009616_0006_0F774591360B8688">
mo&s;t enormous Size that we can commit again&s;t our Fellow-creatures, &s;ince the <HI>Evidences</HI> hereof are &s;o deeply &s;tampt, in the Laws of <HI>Nature,</HI> of GOD, and of <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>What I have mainly in my View, at the pre|&s;ent, is, to make &s;ome Repre&s;entation of the Hor|riblene&s;s of the <HI>Crime</HI> of Murder, and al&s;o of the only <HI>Remedy</HI> provided by GOD for the Sal|vation of the penitent Criminal; both of which Ca&s;es will be toucht upon, if we attend to what is referred to in the Text: And accordingly I propo&s;e, with Brevity, to con&s;ider the two fol|lowing Things, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. What the Things were, that the <HI>Blood</HI> of ABEL &s;pake. 2dly. What the better Things are, that the <HI>Blood</HI> of JESUS &s;peaks: Which done, the Way will be open, 3dly. For a pointed Addre&s;s to the <HI>Criminal</HI> in particular. And 4thly. A Word of Admonition and Exhortation to all in general. And may the SPIRIT of GOD be with us, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Speaker and the Hearers; by who&s;e gracious Influence al&s;o, may we all be thoro'ly convinced of Sin, and have <HI>that</HI> Blood of Sprinkling applied to us, which &s;peaketh bet|ter Things than <HI>that</HI> of ABEL.</P>
<P N="1">I. We are to con&s;ider what the Things were, that the Blood of ABEL &s;pake: In doing which, we &s;hall naturally be led back to view the tragic Scene that open'd to the World, the fir&s;t In&s;tance of Murder;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From that Time Virtue dates her Per&s;ecution from Vice. Bi&s;hop of Meaux's Uni. Hi&s;t. Vol. I.</NOTE> and al&s;o the Proce&s;s of Ju&s;tice a|gain&s;t the audacious Criminal.</P>
<P>You well remember the affecting Hi&s;tory, by which we are informed that the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="009616_0007_0F7745920AF7C510">
was &s;hed by the Hand of his own, and only Bro|ther <HI>Cain,</HI> with whom he was bro't up and lived in Peace; again&s;t whom he had no Quarrel, and to whom he gave no Cau&s;e of Offence. <HI>Cain</HI> was the abandoned Wretch, who (in&s;tigated by Satan, and led on by the Envy, Malice, and Hatred of his own Heart) &s;ought, and found an Opportu|nity to vent the Rage and Malice of his Heart in the Murder of his Brother: <HI>Cur&s;ed be his Anger for it was fierce, and his Wrath for it was cruel</HI>; cruel to the la&s;t Degree, for nothing could allay the groundle&s;s Anger of his guilty Heart, or calm the raging Storm of unprovok'd Wrath and Envy in his troubled Brea&s;t, but the Death of his loving and harmle&s;s Brother. Unnatural <HI>Cain!</HI> to point his deadly Hatred and Fury again&s;t his pious Brother. But this he did, and his furious Pa&s;&s;ion ro&s;e, and flam'd higher and higher, 'till it bur&s;t forth, and impetuou&s;ly drove him on to commit the horrid Deed. He ro&s;e up again&s;t his Brother&mdash;all of a &s;udden and in a Rage he &s;mote him&mdash;the Blow was fatal&mdash;in&s;tantly the Blood gu&s;hes forth, and runs from his wounded Body, and his Life tran&s;pires with his Blood&mdash;<HI>Abel</HI> is dead&mdash;the Deed is done, and it can neither be recall'd or cancell'd; for tho' <HI>Abel</HI> him&s;elf could not &s;peak, yet his Blood &s;pake, and &s;pake with a Voice &s;o loud, that it piere'd Heaven, and enter'd into the Ears of that holy LORD GOD to whom Vengeance belongs. And,</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as there were no Courts of Judica|ture in the World then, as there are now; GOD him&s;elf, the righteous Judge, in &s;ome more imme|diate Way and Manner than now he does, ap|peared to make Inqui&s;ion for Blood, and to pro|&s;ecute

the Criminal: Accordingly <HI>Cain</HI> was ar|raigned before GOD; he was examined, convict|ed, and condemned: An Account of which Pro|ce&s;s we have recorded in <HI>Gene&s;is, Chap. the</HI> 4<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>What a Hell of inward Angui&s;h, Horror and Guilt mu&s;t the Murderer feel in his Brea&s;t, when he came under the immediate Eye, and Examina|tion, and Sentence of GOD! and yet he was &s;o far from Repentance, and &s;o incorrigible in his Wickedne&s;s, that even when the omni&s;cient JUDGE a&s;k'd him the Que&s;tion, <HI>Where is Abel thy Brother?</HI> The vile Mi&s;creant had not only the Confidence, to tell a down right Lie, and &s;ay <HI>I know not,</HI> but al&s;o he had the Impudence, by Way of Reflection and In&s;ult, to a&s;k his Maker that impertinent Que&s;tion, <HI>Am I my</HI> Brother's Keeper? As if he had a Mind to controvert the Point, and maintain his guilty Cau&s;e, again&s;t the great Searcher of Hearts. And alas! is it not too common a Thing in our Day, for tho&s;e Per|&s;ons who have committed an high Crime, to en|deavour to cover and &s;ecrete it with a Lie, and to in&s;ult tho&s;e that examine them too, and even to per&s;evere in their Fal&s;hood, 'till the Witne&s;s of their Crime is call'd and heard? Thus ob&s;tinate was <HI>Cain,</HI> 'till the Witne&s;s of his Murder (i. e. the Blood of Abel) was refer'd to and mentioned, as it was by the Mouth of GOD him&s;elf. But O how mu&s;t it pierce his guilty Heart to hear the <HI>Almighty</HI> pronounce, with a Tone awfully ma|je&s;tic, and full of holy Re&s;entment, and &s;ay, point|ing his Addre&s;s to <HI>Cain, The Voice of thy Bro|ther's Blood crieth unto me from the Ground?</HI> As if the <HI>Almighty</HI> had &s;aid to him,</P>

<Q>See&mdash;there runs the Blood of thy innocent Brother, &s;hed by thy guilty Hand&mdash;Behold it thrilling from his wounded Body, and &s;oaking into the &s;often'd Earth, which has open'd her Mouth to receive his Blood from thy Hand. Know thou, that tho' he is dead, yet his Blood &s;peaks and cries to me from the Ground: This is the Witne&s;s of thy Murder; the Earth al&s;o te&s;tifieth again&s;t thee&punc; and thy guilty Con&s;ci|ence ecchoes to the Cry of both; and now hear the righteous, but terrible Sentence from the Mouth of thy Judge&mdash;<HI>Thou art cur&s;ed from the Earth</HI>&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>We &s;ee that the Blood of Murder &s;peaks loud; it has a Voice that pierces Earth and Heaven; it reaches the Seat of Ju&s;tice and the Throne of God: The Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> did &s;o; and tho' there was no other human Eye that was a living Wit|ne&s;s to the Murder, but the Eye of <HI>Cain</HI>; yet as an ancient Writer &s;aith, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cornelius a Lap: Com: in Pent:</NOTE>
<Q>The Earth was a Witne&s;s, and the Heavens too, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars,</Q> &amp;c.
And GOD him&s;elf be|ing the Judge, He well under&s;tood the Te&s;timony that the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es gave.</P>
<P>But more immediately to the Point in Hand. The Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> &s;pake many Things plain and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; particularly, it &s;pake not only who his Murderer was, pointing to his Brother again&s;t whom his Blood cried: It &s;pake not only the enormous Guilt and Cruelty of his Brother, who, in committing the black Crime, laid a&s;ide, and &s;uppre&s;t the acting of all the Principles of Humanity, brotherly Affection, and every generous Sentiment; and abandon'd him&s;elf to
<PB N="12" REF="009616_0010_0F77459430E9BE68">
the contrary Principles of gnawing Envy, dead|ly Malice, and cruel Hatred; the Influence of which he followed, 'till he violently broke thro' all the Laws of Relation, Connection, Humanity, Ju&s;tice, and of GOD him&s;elf; and made a bloo|dy Victim of his innocent Brother: I &s;ay, the Blood of Abel not only &s;pake this, but al&s;o,</P>
<P>It &s;pake for Judgment, and a perfect Sentence a|gain&s;t the Murderer, without the lea&s;t Variation from &s;trict Ju&s;tice and the e&s;tabli&s;hed Law of Heaven.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, it &s;pake for Vengeance to be executed to the full, without the lea&s;t Mercy or Mitigation: And there was the highe&s;t Rea&s;on that the Voice of his Blood &s;hould be heard and an&s;wered, for the Criminal had violated all the Laws of Nature, and of Nature's GOD.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things &s;pake the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI>: And, the Blood of Murder &s;peaks the &s;ame Things for Sub&s;tance now, and has &s;poke the &s;ame Things thro' all Ages of the World, that the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> did: Nor has the Earth been a Stranger to the Repetition of the like Crime, and the like Cry; for &s;he has, from Time to Time, open'd her Mouth to receive the Blood of Murder from the Hands of wicked Men.</P>
<P>But tho' the Sin of Murder is a Sin that wears the Colour of Scarlet and Crim&s;on, and brings the mo&s;t aggravated Guilt upon the Criminal; &s;till, the Greatne&s;s of this Sin don't le&s;&s;en the evil Nature and Con&s;equence of other Sins; for every Sin (tho' not &s;o aggravated as this, yet) is really wounding and de&s;tructive to the Soul as this is; becau&s;e every Sin is a Violation of the &s;ame per|fect Law of GOD, and renders the Sinner obnoxi|ous to the Malediction of the Law; for the Law
<PB N="13" REF="009616_0011_0F7745960DECB668">
being unalterably ju&s;t and good, it mu&s;t, as it does, &s;peak aloud for Judgment and Vengeance again&s;t the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or; and the Author of the Law pronounceth, (let us hear the Sentence and lay it to Heart) <HI>The Soul that &s;inneth &s;hall die</HI>; nor will the Almighty alter a Tittle of his Law, or do any Thing that will &s;tain his glorious Throne, for the Sake of &s;aving a guilty Creature from de&s;erved Death and De&s;truction: And if this is the Ca&s;e, all of us have Rea&s;on to be alarm|ed; for, who of us can &s;ay we are without Sin, or that we have not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the perfect Law of God in Thought, Word, or Deed, Times with|out Number? Indeed, thro' the re&s;training Good|ne&s;s of GOD, we may be kept back from tho&s;e flagrant Acts of Wickedne&s;s, which expo&s;e us to the Ob&s;ervation and Puni&s;hment of human Laws: But we mu&s;t remember that our eternal JUDGE is not limited to tho&s;e Laws in proceeding with us&mdash;far from it&mdash;he is limited only by his own perfect and eternal Law, to which he &s;trictly attends in dealing with us: And this Law is &s;o pure, &s;piritual, and exten&s;ive, that it reaches the Tho'ts and Motions of the Heart, as well as the Actions of the Life: Accordingly we find that it declares us Murderers for hating our Brother, as well as for taking away his mortal Life; and &s;o of every other Sin; the Law condemns us for the in-dwelling, as well as for the out-breaking of it. And,</P>
<P>If there was no Provi&s;ion made for our Pardon and Redemption, but what is reveal'd in the pure and perfect Law of GOD; not only the <HI>Criminal</HI> here pre&s;ent, but al&s;o every Soul of us mu&s;t be condemn'd and damn'd to all Eternity; for we
<PB N="14" REF="009616_0012_0F774596B5DFCB38">
being Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the Law, it calls as loud for Vengeance again&s;t us, as the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> did for Vengeance again&s;t <HI>Cain; Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all Things written in the Book of the Law to do them</HI>; in&s;tead of continu|ing in all Things, we have fail'd in all Things, nor is it po&s;&s;ible for us, by any Offerings we can make, or Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s that we can do, ei|ther to atone for our Offences, or to e&s;cape the Vengeance of GOD, to which we are condemn'd by his holy Law.</P>
<P>The Cry of the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> again&s;t <HI>Cain,</HI> repre&s;ents the Spirit and the Language of the Law again&s;t the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or; &s;o that if we Sinners, think to obtain the Favour of GOD our Judge, by the Deeds of the Law, we &s;hall meet with the mo&s;t amazing Di&s;appointment; for in&s;tead of hearing any Thing in our Favour, we &s;hall hear the Law denounce again&s;t us, Death and Damna|tion, and the glorious Author of the Law will ra|tify the Sentence.</P>
<P>But, through the tender Mercies of our GOD, (ble&s;&s;ed be his Name) we hear a different Voice from the Go&s;pel, and a different Cry from the Blood of HIM <HI>who offered him&s;elf a Sacrifice for our Sins; who was wounded for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|ons</HI>; who bled to wa&s;h us from our Guilt and moral Pollution; who died that we might live for ever. The Scene now changeth from Dark|ne&s;s to Light; and O! that the Light of the Glory of GOD, in the Face of JESUS CHRIST, may &s;hine into our Hearts, and rai&s;e us up to the lively Hope of Pardon and eternal Life! We are now call'd from a particular Attention to tho&s;e Things that the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> &s;pake, and we are invited,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="009616_0013_0F77459775D52C78">II. To con&s;ider the better Things that the Blood of JESUS &s;peaks.</P>

<P N="1">1&s;t.

<PB N="17" REF="009616_0015_0F774598C3A56D08">
we are invited. And furthermore; the &s;ame Blood being &s;prinkled upon us, or applied to our Per&s;ons and Con&s;ciences, effectually removes our Guilt, and renders our Per&s;ons righteous in the Eye of GOD; al&s;o it purges our Hearts from moral Defilement, and renders our Natures holy; &s;o the Apo&s;tle in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> ar|gueth: <HI>If the Blood of Bulls and Goats, and the A&s;hes of an Heifer, &s;prinkling the Unclean, &s;anctifieth to the purifying of the Fle&s;h; how much more &s;hall the Blood of Chri&s;t, who thro' the eternal Spirit, offered him&s;elf without Spot to GOD, purge your Con&s;ciences from dead Works, to &s;erve the living GOD!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Things that the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;peaks are many, and very comfortable. The Import of what it &s;peaks is; that the full Price of our Redemption from Sin, Wrath and Ruin, is paid down; and that the Way to GOD and Glory is laid open, by Virtue of it. Al&s;o it &s;peaks the Language of Pardon, Mercy, and Grace, to the mo&s;t guilty and mi&s;erable Sinner; for his Blood &s;peaks the &s;ame Language that dropt from his &s;acred Mouth when he hung upon the Cro&s;s, <HI>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI> This he &s;pake in Favour of his cruel Mur|derers, while they were perpetrating the horrid Act. O Love! beyond all Degrees of Compa|ri&s;on, to cry for Pardon to be given to his Cru|cifiers, even in his Crucifixion-Pangs! For the like Ble&s;&s;ing, his Blood &s;peaks now; it cries for pardoning Mercy for the greate&s;t Criminals, and pleads for their Admi&s;&s;ion to the Favour of GOD: "When Ju&s;tice calls for Sinners Blood, the Sa|viour &s;hews his own" thro' the Virtue of which,
<PB N="18" REF="009616_0016_0F77459972183BE8">
the believing Sinner is accepted of GOD, and ju&s;tified from all Things, from which he could not be ju&s;tified by the Law of Mo&s;es. Further|more; the Import of what it &s;peaks, abundantly a&s;&s;ures us, that it is an effectual Means, being ap|plied to clean&s;e us from the deepe&s;t Stains that Sin has fix'd in our Souls: Sprinkled with his Blood, the Eyes of our Under&s;tandings are open'd to behold the Glory of GOD in the Face of Chri&s;t, our Hearts too are &s;often'd into evangelic Repentance; our Con&s;ciences are purged from dead Works; our Pa&s;&s;ions are renewed, and our whole Souls begin to &s;hine in moral Purity. In a Word; his Blood &s;peaks, <HI>healing to the broken-hearted&mdash;Deliverance to Captives&mdash; the opening of the Pri&s;on to them that are bound,</HI> and Salva|tion, with eternal Glory to them that de&s;erve Damnation and eternal Mi&s;ery. His Blood &s;peaks and pleads with GOD, for Mercy to be granted to Sinners; and it &s;peaks and pleads with Sin|ners, to come and wa&s;h in the healing Fountain of it; and to look unto Him for Salvation; promi&s;ing them an Admi&s;&s;ion into the Kingdom of Grace here, and into the Kingdom of Glory hereafter.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the comfortable Things that the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;peaks; and O! how much better are they, than the Things that the Blood of <HI>Abel,</HI> or the Blood of Murder, or the violated Law of GOD &s;peak to the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or. The&s;e latter &s;peak for the Judgment of Condemnation again&s;t the guilty; but the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;peaks for Pardon, Acquittance, and eternal Life: The&s;e, &s;peak for Vengance, without Mercy, to be poured upon the Criminals; but
<PB N="19" REF="009616_0017_0F77459A44B202D8">
the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> pleads the contrary; it cries with an interceeding Voice before the Throne of GOD;
<Q>Spare the Rebels&mdash;forgive the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors&mdash;receive them to Favour and immor|tal Bli&s;s; Here is Blood to atone for their Offences&mdash;to magnify the violated Law&mdash;and to &s;atisfy the Ju&s;tice of Heaven; Her is Blood to wa&s;h their &s;potted Souls, and to cau&s;e them to &s;hine in all the Beauties of Holine&s;s.</Q></P>

<P>Your Crime is attended with the mo&s;t aggra|vating Circum&s;tances; and you have Rea&s;on to fear an aggravated Puni&s;hment.

<P>You &s;ee and hear what terrible Things the Blood of Murder, and the Laws of Men &s;peak again&s;t the Criminal, and you ought to be affect|ed therewith, tho' they don't &s;peak directly again&s;t you: But tho' they don't, yet, again&s;t every one of you, who have not come by a living Faith to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, nor been &s;prinkled with the Merits of his precious Blood, which alone can take away Sin; again&s;t you, the holy Law of GOD &s;peaks, and denounces as terrible Things as ever the Blood of <HI>Abel</HI> did again&s;t <HI>Cain</HI>; for you being a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the Law, it breathes out no|thing but Woes, Cur&s;es, Condemnation and eter|nal Death again&s;t you; and the Sentence of the Law is ratified by GOD him&s;elf, who declares, <HI>The Soul that &s;inneth &s;hall die</HI>: And had it not been for the Death of Chri&s;t, our Surety, there would be no Hope for us.

<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. Sen&s;ible that we are Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the Law of GOD, and that we have guilty and pol|luted Hearts, Let us come to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Mediator

of the New Covenant, and rely intirely upon the Power and Virtue of his Blood, for the Pardon of our Sins, for Reconciliation with GOD, and for the clean&s;ing of our rational Nature from mo|ral Defilement; that &s;o we may be holy in Heart, and for the future, may walk in Newne&s;s of Life, and always exerci&s;e our&s;elves <HI>to keep a Con&s;cience void of Offence toward</HI> GOD <HI>and toward Man:</HI> Thus living, we &s;hall neither come to an untime|ly and violent End thro' overmuch Wickedne&s;s, nor have Cau&s;e to fear with any Amazement when the Time of our Departure from this mor|tal Life &s;hall come; but &s;hall die in Peace&mdash;fall a&s;leep in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> and enter into everla&s;ting Re&s;t.</P>
<P>And now in Behalf of the <HI>Criminal,</HI> let me call upon you all, not to cea&s;e praying for him, 'till he cea&s;es to be a Subject of Prayer: Tho' he is a bloody Malefactor, yet 'tis cruel and un|chri&s;tian to deny him your Prayers in the la&s;t Moments of Life. O, &s;end up your fervent and ince&s;&s;ant Supplications to the Throne of Grace, for Mercy on him, 'till his mortal Life tran&s;pires, and his immortal Soul returns to GOD who gave it.</P>
<P>Finally; Let us all in a religious Manner, hum|bly deplore this awful Judgment of GOD, in &s;uffering &s;uch a horrible Murder to be committed among us; and let it alarm us all to &s;tand in Awe and not &s;in. In a &s;pecial Manner, let me ear|ne&s;tly warn and admoni&s;h you all, to watch and guard again&s;t all Indecencies, Rudene&s;s, Vanity, and unbecoming Behaviour; which, upon this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, will be mo&s;t highly provoking to the holy GOD, a faint Re&s;emblance of who&s;e revenging Ju&s;tice upon the incorrigible Sinner, is
<PB N="31" REF="009616_0029_0F76F4554B11DCC0">
&s;et before us this Day. Therefore be exhorted to behave &s;oberly and decently, and to be earne&s;t in your Prayers to almighty GOD, that he would keep you now, and at all Times, hereafter, from every wicked Thing. In a Word, let us live as the Grace of GOD teaches&mdash;let us lay a&s;ide Anger, Wrath, Malice, and every Sin that mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets us; and let us live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly, looking for the ble&s;&s;ed Hope, and glorious Appearing of the great GOD and our Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> that when he &s;hall appear, we may &s;ee him with Joy, and be admitted to dwell in his immediate Pre&s;ence and heavenly Kingdom for evermore.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE bloody Murder of Mi&s;s <HI>Elizabeth Mc+Kin&s;try,</HI> on <HI>June</HI> the 4th, 1763, which gave Occa&s;ion for the preaching of the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, may truly be placed among the a&s;toni&s;hing Events of Providence, and the alarming Frailties of human Nature: One cannot call to Mind the particular Circum&s;tances of this tragic Scene, without the deepe&s;t Emotions of Horror, Pity and Indignation.</P>
<P>The Negro Boy who perpetrated this lament|able Crime, was born in <HI>Africa,</HI> and at the Age of about eight Years was brought into <HI>New-England,</HI> where he lived about five Years in the &s;ame Family with Mi&s;s <HI>McKin&s;try,</HI> at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>; his Ma&s;ter then dying, he was purcha&s;ed by her Brother Doctor <HI>McKin&s;try</HI> of <HI>Taunton,</HI> where he had lived three Years when the Murder was com|mitted, the decea&s;ed having been al&s;o about two Years in the &s;ame Family; &s;o that from his Childhood (excepting one Year) he had lived in the &s;ame Family with her; and during this Time he was treated with all the Tenderne&s;s and In|&s;truction that could be de&s;ired. He always ap|peared
<PB N="33" REF="009616_0031_0F76F45934E7B380">
happy in his Situation, and &s;hewed an un|common Readine&s;s to do his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Faith|fulne&s;s to perform what he undertook, without the lea&s;t Appearance of Sullenne&s;s or Malice. After he had done the Fact, he rode to <HI>Newport,</HI> ne|ver &s;hewing the lea&s;t Concern 'till he was appre|hended; he then made &s;ome artful Excu&s;es 'till he had been committed about twelve Hours, when he confe&s;&s;ed the whole Fact, the Sub&s;tance of which was, "That early in the Morning Mi&s;s <HI>McKin&s;try,</HI> a little Girl, and him&s;elf, being the only Per&s;ons of the Family that were up; and the little Girl being gone up Stairs, as Mi&s;s <HI>Mc+Kin&s;try</HI> was &s;tooping over the Fire, he catch'd up a Flat-Iron that &s;tood on the Hearth, &s;truck her on the Head, and knock'd her into the Fire, which burnt her Face; he then gave her another Blow, and immediately dragged her down the Cellar Stairs, where finding an old Ax, he &s;truck her with it on the Head, and made off as fa&s;t as he could."</P>
<P>After his Commitment, he appeared very pe|nitent, and expre&s;&s;ed his Sorrow for the Crime: Particularly for the Grief he had brought on his Ma&s;ter's Family; in &s;peaking of which, he al|ways &s;eem'd the mo&s;t affected. He declared con|&s;tantly, during the whole of his Impri&s;onment to his la&s;t Moment, that he never had any Anger a|gain&s;t the decea&s;ed, nor any of the Family; and that he had never received any Treatment that de&s;erv|ed it: And tho' he always appeared free to an|&s;wer any Que&s;tions that were a&s;ked him, yet he never gave any Rea&s;on for committing the Crime, but that he was prompted to it by a Negro Boy of his Acquaintance, who threatned to kill him

if he did not do it; this he per&s;i&s;ted in to his dying Moment.</P>
<P>At his Trial he pleaded Guilty; but &s;hewed no Emotion at the pronouncing Sentence of Death, nor at the public Wor&s;hip, where in his Hearing, &s;everal Sermons be&s;ide this were preach|ed on the Occa&s;ion; nor even at the Place of Execution: This would naturally be con&s;trued as Stupidity or Sullenne&s;s, had not his Di&s;cour&s;e plainly &s;hown that he had a true Sen&s;e of his Crime, and right Notions of a future State.</P>
<P>At the Gallows he made a long Speech to the Spectators, particularly to tho&s;e of his own Colour, which for Sub&s;tance was pertinent and impor|tant; he expre&s;s'd great Concern for his Ma&s;ter's Family; was very particular in thanking every Body that had taken Notice of him while in Pri&s;on; he acknowledged his Condemnation ju&s;t; he expre&s;&s;ed his Sen&s;e of his Guilt, and the Hopes he had of Forgivene&s;s and future Happine&s;s, thro' the Mercy of God in Chri&s;t; and then, after re|peating the Lord's Prayer di&s;tinctly, he was turn'd off.</P>
<P>The decea&s;ed, who was the unhappy Object of this unaccountable Malice, was a Daughter of the Pev'd. Mr. <HI>John McKin&s;try,</HI> late of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>; a young Lady of a chearful Di&s;po&s;ition, an even generous Temper, and every Way of a wor|thy Character: After tarrying with her Brother, &s;he was preparing to return to her Mother at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> when in a Moment that &s;he tho't not of, &s;he was hurried in this cruel Manner to her long Home.</P>
<P>The&s;e Circum&s;tances are more particularly mentioned, as they are &s;uch Peculiarities of this

dark Affair, as naturally fill us with more A&s;to|ni&s;hment and Indignation, than if the &s;ame had happened after repeated Re&s;entments, &s;ettled Ma|lice, or &s;udden Provocation; for it &s;eems difficult to conceive how one, who never &s;hew'd ill-nature on any Occa&s;ion, and who always appeared chear|ful and contented, &s;hould of a &s;udden, without Provocation, commit the mo&s;t barbarous Cruelty on one who never offended him, and who&s;e Be|haviour had gain'd the E&s;teem of all who knew her: Surely then it is a &s;tricking In&s;tance of the Weakne&s;s of human Nature, the horrid Effects of our ungovern'd Pa&s;&s;ions, and of the Ba&s;ene&s;s and Danger of meer <HI>&s;illy good Nature,</HI> without natu|ral Tenderne&s;s, or virtuous Principles. It natu|rally calls upon tho&s;e who have the Care of Ne|groes to be very vigilant in removing the Preju|dices of their barbarous Di&s;po&s;ition by In&s;tructi|on, and to in&s;till into their Minds &s;uch Chri&s;tian Principles as may influence their Actions when ab&s;ent from the Eye of their Ma&s;ters; and par|ticularly to in&s;pect their companying together, that grand Source of all the Evils that have a|ri&s;en &s;o frequently from this Nation, when in their Con&s;pirings they cry out, <HI>Let us lay wait for Blood, let us lurk privily for the Innocent without a Cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;udden Manner in which Mi&s;s <HI>McKin&s;try</HI> came to her End, is an alarming Lecture on the Uncertainty of human Life, and &s;hows us the &s;urprizing Attacks of the <HI>King of Terrors,</HI> who&s;e Snares continually &s;urround us, and who&s;e Exe|cutioners walk in the dark: Surely in the Mid&s;t of Life we are in Death; and the Hand that we expected to admini&s;ter to our Comfort, may deal the fatal Blow.</P>
