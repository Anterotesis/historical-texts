<HEAD>STRICTURES, &amp;c. TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>A PAMPLET, entitled <HI>A friendly addre&s;s to all rea|&s;onable Americans,</HI> adverti&s;ed and &s;old by Mr. James Rivington, of New-York, is of &s;o extraordinary a nature that it is difficult for any Man, who is intere&s;ted in the wel|fare of the Community (whatever contempt he may have for the performance) to remain &s;ilent.&mdash;I know not whe|ther the author is a Layman or Eccle&s;ia&s;tic, but he bears &s;trongly the character of the latter.&mdash;He has the want of candour and truth, the apparent &s;pirit of per&s;ecution, the unforgivene&s;s, the deadly hatred to Di&s;&s;enters, and the zeal for arbitrary power, which has di&s;tingui&s;hed Churchmen in all ages, and more particularly the <HI>high</HI> part of the Church of England; I cannot help therefore con&s;idering him as one of this order.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of his pamphlet is manife&s;tly to di&s;&s;olve the &s;pirit of union, and check the noble ardor prevailing through the continent; but his zeal &s;o far outruns his a|bilities, that there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to think that his Reverence has laboured to little effect.&mdash;His di&s;cretion &s;eems to be &s;till le&s;s than his genius.&mdash;A man of common judgment would not &s;o wantonly have attacked the gene|ral reigning principles and opinions of a people, whom he intends to &s;educe or intimidate out of their rights and pri|vileges: For in&s;tance, I believe there are ninety-nine A|mericans in a hundred, who think that Charles the Fir&s;t was an execrable tyrant, that he met with no harder fate than he de&s;erved, and that his two &s;ons ought in ju&s;tice to have made the &s;ame exit. To de&s;cant therefore on the criminality of the re&s;i&s;tance made to that tyrant; to affect on every occa&s;ion giving the title of rebellion to the civil war which brought him to ju&s;tice, is a degree of weakne&s;s which no man who is not blinded by the Daemon of ja|cobiti&s;m

could po&s;&s;ibly be guilty of.&mdash;But to preach up, in this enlightened age (as he does in almo&s;t expre&s;s terms) pa&s;&s;ive obedience, is a mark of lunacy, or at lea&s;t it proves that the moment a head begins to itch for a mitre, it loo&s;es the faculty of rea&s;oning, for if the principle of pa&s;|&s;ive obedience is admitted, the gracious Prince, for whom his Reverence profe&s;&s;es &s;o great a devotion, is a down|right u&s;urper, and the Parliament of which he &s;peaks &s;o re&s;pectfully, Lords and Commons, are rebels and traitors.</P>
<P>The doctrines he aims to inculcate, are as follow&mdash;<HI>That the Parliament has a right to tax you without your con&s;ent; that the duty upon tea is no tax; that this duty is your only grievance; that the cau&s;e of Bo&s;ton is their own concern; that it is not your cau&s;e; that the puni&s;hment of Bo&s;ton is a ju&s;t puni&s;hment; that it is lenient; that it is not equal to the crimes; that the Bo&s;tonians are rebels traitors, and pampered fanatics; that the Congre&s;s are little better; that no mi&s;|conduct of admini&s;tration can ju&s;tify or excu&s;e open di&s;re&s;pect; that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is to be paid to the higher powers, whatever character they be; that an Apo&s;tle enjoined &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the tyrant Nero; that of all people under heaven the King's A|merican &s;ubjects have the lea&s;t cau&s;e for complaint; that the pre&s;ent confu&s;ion of the Colonies has been occa&s;ioned by fal&s;e a|larms; that none of your legal rights have been invaded: no injury has been done you, and con&s;equently that you can never be ju&s;tified in re&s;enting that of which you have no rea&s;on to complain; that you are no judges of the rights of Parliament; that the Parliament ought to act according to their own judg|ment, not according to yours, even in things which concern you principally or &s;olely; that they a&s;&s;ert they have the right in que&s;tion; that you have never proved they have not; that you have always believed or allowed they had it until the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; that the Quebec Bill is a ju&s;t &amp; con&s;titutional Bill; that the Canadians are likely to prove the be&s;t &amp; mo&s;t loyal &s;ub|jects in his Maje&s;ty's American dominions; that there is too much rea&s;on to believe that the minds of the Americans are un|principled, &amp; their hearts di&s;po&s;ed for rebellion; that &s;ince the reduction of Canada, they have been bloated with a vain opi|nion of their own power and importance; that the I&s;land of Great-Britain is able to govern</HI> (that is to dragoon) <HI>ten A|mericas;

that the moment it is known that America is no longer under the protection of Great-Britain, all the maritime powers of Europe would join to ravage your &s;ea ports, plun|der and &s;eize your &s;hips merely for the plea&s;ure of ravaging;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is perhaps the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous idea that ever was hatched in a di&s;tempered brain. America (more particularly &s;ince the di&s;trac|tions in Poland have taken place) has been the great granary or <HI>cell<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> penaria</HI> of Europe.&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive that the different mari|time powers &s;hould unite to deprive them&s;elves of the chief means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nce, merely for the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">un's &s;ake? Is it not more natural to &s;up|po&s;e that they would out bid each other for your friend&s;hip and com|merce on which &s;o much depends? When the Low Countries withdrew them&s;elves from the dominion of Spain, did England, France, and the other Powers immediately &s;et about ravaging their &s;ea ports and &s;eizing their &s;hips? Did they not, on the contrary, exert them&s;elves directly and indirectly to a&s;&s;i&s;t them? The ea&s;e is &s;imilar, the event would be &s;imilar; and that Great-Britain would not be powerful enough at &s;ea, when &s;eparated from her Colonies; to prevent this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall refer my readers to Ma&s;&s;ie's E&s;timates, the authority of which has never been di&s;puted, and which demon&s;trate, that more than half the naval power of Great-Britain &s;tands on her American foundation.</NOTE> <HI>that all the maritime powers of the world would not di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Great-Britain of the empire of the &s;ea, even when America is &s;eparated from her.</HI> Now I challenge the world to produce &s;o many wicked &s;entiments, &s;tupid principles, audaciou&s;ly fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, &amp; mon&s;trous ab&s;urdities, crouded together in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s. All his po&s;itions are indeed &s;o &s;elf-evidently ab&s;urd and fal&s;e, that it would be an in&s;ult to American under&s;tandings, &s;eriou&s;ly to attempt refuting them. I &s;hall only beg leave to take notice of the curious argument he u&s;es to prove the duty on tea to be no tax; it is that, <HI>unle&s;s we con&s;ent to the tax, we are not to pay the the duty. We may refu&s;e purcha&s;ing it if we plea&s;e.</HI> The &s;ame logic would demon&s;trate that a duty on beer, candles, or &s;oap, would be no tax, as we are not ab&s;olutely obliged to drink beer; we may drink water, we may go to bed before it is dark, and we are not forced to wa&s;h our &s;hirts. His a&s;&s;ertion that Great Britain, when divorced from her Colonies, will &s;till hold the empire of the &s;eas, in &s;pite of all the powers of the world, is &s;till more ingenious. It a|mounts to this, that <HI>without the po&s;&s;ible means of procuring timber, iron, plank, ma&s;ts, pitch, tar, or hemp, to furni&s;h out a &s;ingle frigate, they may build more &s;hips then all the world

put together;</HI> that <HI>when her nur&s;ery for &s;eamen is de&s;troyed, and all the commerce on which the exi&s;tence of &s;eamen depends, is annihilated, they will then be able to man more fleets than the whole univer&s;e put together.</HI> But I am a&s;hamed of tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ing on the public patience, in making &s;trictures on &s;uch ridiculous articles, I &s;hall therefore pa&s;s on to &s;ome que&s;ti|ons which have not been &s;o much agitated, and on which, if I mi&s;take not, his reverence lays the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s; for as he mode&s;tly declares, that he has no opinion of your courage, it was natural for him to con&s;ider intimidation and terror as the mo&s;t powerful figures of rhetoric. <HI>Regular armies from Great-Britain, He&s;&s;ians, Hanoverians, royal &s;tandards erected, &s;kilful</HI> G<HI>enerals, legions of Canadians, and unnumbered tribes of Savages; &s;words flaming in the front and rear, pe&s;tilence, de&s;olation and famine,</HI> are all mar&s;halled in a mo&s;t dreadful order by this church-militant author.&mdash;But let us &s;omewhat minutely examine the picture, and &s;ee whether, &s;tript of its fal&s;e colours, it has any thing re|ally terrifying. His reverence begins with a&s;&s;uring us, that there is no room to doubt but that &s;uch an army as was employed in the reduction of Canada (that is an army of &s;even thou&s;and men) would be more than &s;ufficient for the conque&s;t of all the di&s;affected American Colonies (which are in fact all the Colonies.) Should <HI>&s;uch</HI> a re&s;olution be|come nece&s;&s;ary, in order to reduce them to obedience, for my own part, I think there is very great rea&s;on to doubt, that &s;even thou&s;and, even of the be&s;t troops, are able to conquer two hundred thou&s;and of the mo&s;t di&s;orderly pea|&s;antry upon earth, if they were animated in defence of e|very thing they hold mo&s;t dear &amp; &s;acred; and there is &s;till greater rea&s;on to doubt that 7000 very indifferent troops, compo&s;ed of the refu&s;e of an exhau&s;ted nation, few of whom have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> action of any kind, &s;hould be able to conquer two hundred thou&s;and active, vigorous yeomanry, fired with the noble ardor, we &s;ee prevalent through the conti|nent, all armed, all expert in the u&s;e of arms almo&s;t from their cradle. The &s;ucce&s;s of Quebec it is true, does infi|nite honor to the Engli&s;h arms, the army was, I believe, only for a thou&s;and, the enemy were perhaps more than double, but &s;ixteen thou&s;and men are not two hundred
<PB N="7" REF="014155_0007_0F9330AB0F9A6668">
thou&s;and. The fate of Canada, depended upon one deci|&s;ive action, but it is impo&s;&s;ible to calculate how many vic|tories mu&s;t be gained before the&s;e Colonies could be &s;ub|dued, whereas a &s;ingle victory gained by the Colonies mu&s;t decide the conte&s;t in their favour. In the affair of Que|bec there is another circum&s;tance to be con&s;idered, it was Wolfe, who commanded; a man of the mo&s;t wonderful talents, formed to level all difficulties; to render the mo&s;t de&s;picable &s;oldiery almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly an army of heroes. In &s;hort, the genius of the man was &s;o extraordinary, the event was &s;o extraordinary that no inferences can be drawn from it; but this without pre&s;umption may be a&s;&s;erted, that no General now exi&s;ting in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, would with double or treble his number have &s;ucceeded in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. One thing more I mu&s;t add in ho|nor of that illu&s;trious per&s;onage, that the &s;ame greatne&s;s of &s;oul which qualified him to conquer the natural here|ditary enemies of his country, would have made him reject with horror the Hangman's office, which others, who are not endowed with conquering attributes, will with readine&s;s accept.</P>
<P>IT is notorious that Mr. Wolfe was not only the fir&s;t of &s;oldiers, but that he was a mo&s;t liberal, virtuous citizen, that he was pa&s;&s;ionately attached to the liberties of his coun|try, and of mankind; and that he was particularly an ene|my to large &s;tanding armies in time of peace. It is on the other hand remarkable, that all the advocates for &s;tanding armies; all tho&s;e who are the fonde&s;t of the faddling and parade of war, are the mo&s;t active in avoiding real &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THIS tremendous &s;ooth&s;ayer, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;o great a miracle &s;hould happen in our favour, as that the trifling body of five hundred thou&s;and men, though firm|ly united (for every man in America, firmly united, would not amount to le&s;s) &s;hould be able to with&s;tand his &s;even thou&s;and; goes on to rattle in our ears, armies of He&s;&s;ians and Hanoverians. I wi&s;h to Heaven he had for once de|viated into probability &amp; truth. I wi&s;h 10,000 of them could po&s;&s;ibly be tran&s;ported to-morrow. The purpo&s;e they would an&s;wer, is a purpo&s;e devoutly to be wi&s;hed for; they would be an addition to this continent of ju&s;t &s;o many u&s;e|ful
<PB N="8" REF="014155_0008_0F9330ABCCD97590">
and excellent citizens, for I will venture to affirm, (af|firming is infectious) that in le&s;s than four months not two of the&s;e ten thou&s;and would remain with their Colours. But does not this reverend Gentleman know, that in the year 1764 a convention was formed by mo&s;t of the Prin|ces of the empire, at the head of which convention were the Emperor him&s;elf and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, to prevent the alarming emigrations which threatened depopulation to Germany? Does he not know that no troops can march out of the empire without the con&s;ent of the empire? Does he not know that the Elector of Hanover and the Emperor are upon exceedingly ill terms? Does he not know that the Elector of Hanover and the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia are &s;till upon wor&s;e? Is he &s;ure that the Landgrave of He&s;s would &s;ell his troops (for as not one man would re|turn back to their country, he mu&s;t con&s;ider them as for|ever &s;old!) Is he &s;ure that as the finances of Great-Britain &s;tand, the va&s;t &s;um nece&s;&s;ary for this purcha&s;e would be conveniently found? Is he &s;ure that the State of Hanover would con&s;ent to &s;uch a draining of their country? I know not how it is; but his mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty GEORGE the Third, who in England is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the mo&s;t gra|cious of Sovereigns, the wi&s;e&s;t, greate&s;t, and be&s;t of Kings, is not very popular in the Electorate of Hanover. The&s;e people &s;eem to think it hard that Two Hundred and Twen|ty Thou&s;and Pounds &s;hould annually be drawn from them, for the purpo&s;es (as they conceive it) of corrupting the Members of St. Stephen's Chapel, in order to &s;upport the power and authority of a &s;et of men, who from the beginning have been enemies to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Hanover line, and who &s;hewed a particular animo&s;ity to their la&s;t and favourite Prince, George the Second; but the&s;e difficulties (great and un&s;urmountable as to a common mortal they appear) our divine Exorci&s;t has in an in&s;tant conjured down, and, by a &s;ingle motion of his enchanted wand, has tran&s;ported whole armies, in &s;pite of their re&s;pective Princes, and without the con&s;ent of their re&s;pective States, from the interior parts of Germany, acro&s;s the Atlantic into the plains of New-England and Penn|&s;ylvania. But he does not confine him&s;elf to the intro|duction

of his Germans. He proceeds next to erect the Royal Standard, to which he tells us that all who have the courage to declare them&s;elve now friends to government, will undoubtedly re&s;ort, and the&s;e, he &s;ays, in a good cau&s;e, will be of them&s;elves formidable to their oppo&s;ers: Dreadfully formidable they mu&s;t be indeed! There would re&s;ort to it, let me &s;ee (for the re&s;pectable town of Rye have declared them&s;elves a kind of neutrals, <HI>rather than friends to government)</HI> there would re&s;ort to it, Mr. Ju&s;tice Sewell, the honorable Mr. Paxton, Brigadier Ruggles, and about eight or ten more mandamus Councilmen, with perhaps twice their number of Expectants, and not le&s;s than twenty of the unrecanted Hutchin&s;onian Addre&s;&s;ers.&mdash;The&s;e the four Provinces of New-England alone would &s;end forth&mdash;New-York would furni&s;h &s;ix, &s;even or proba|bly eight, volunteers from a certain knot, who are in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion or expectation of contracts, and the fourth part of a dozen of high flying Church of England Romani&s;ed Prie&s;ts&mdash;I repre&s;ent to my&s;elf the formidable countenance they will make, when arranged under the Royal or mini|&s;terial Standard; but what will add to the terror of the appearance, will be their Reverend Pontifix him&s;elf, whom I conceive marching in the front, an inqui&s;itorial frown up|on his brow, his bands and canonicals floating to the air, bearing a cro&s;s in his hands, with the tremendous motto, <HI>In hoc &s;igno vinces,</HI> flaming upon it in capital letters of blood, leading them on, and exciting them to victory. It is impo&s;&s;ible, that men, who are not under an infatuation by the judgment of heaven, &s;hould flatter them&s;elves, that forty thou&s;and American Yeomanry (for we are a&s;&s;ured, by the &s;ame great authority, that more than forty thou|&s;and cannot be brought to action) &s;hould &s;tand the &s;hock of this dreadful Phalanx.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hould beg pardon for attempting to be ludi|crous upon a &s;ubject which demands our utmo&s;t indigna|tion.&mdash;I &s;hall now therefore on the pre&s;umption that the People of England &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t to &s;en&s;e, virtue and &s;pirit, as to &s;uffer their profligate Mi&s;rulers to per&s;evere in their pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, endeavour to &s;tate to you what is

their force, and what is yours.&mdash;I &s;hall endeavour to re|move the fal&s;e terrors which this writer would hold out, in order to intimidate you from the defence of your liber|ties and tho&s;e of your po&s;terity, that he and his &s;imilars may wallow in &s;inecures and benefices heaped up from the fruits of your labour and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>GREAT-BRITAIN has, I believe, of infantry at home (comprehending Ireland, and exclu&s;ive of the guards) fif|teen thou&s;and men.&mdash;They find the greate&s;t difficulty in keeping the regiments up to any thing near their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment&mdash;what they are able to procure are of the wor&s;t &s;ort. They are compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t debauched Weavers' pren|tices, the &s;cum of the Iri&s;h Roman Catholics, who de&s;ert upon every occa&s;ion, and a few, very few, Scotch, who are not &s;trong enough to carry packs.&mdash;This is no exagera|tion; tho&s;e who have been lately at Bo&s;ton, repre&s;ent the &s;oldiers there (one or two regiments excepted) as very de|fective in &s;ize, and apparently in &s;trength: But we &s;hall be told they are &s;till regulars, and regulars have an irre&s;i&s;t|able advantage.&mdash;There is, perhaps, more impo&s;ition in the term <HI>regular troops,</HI> than in any of the jargon which i&s;|&s;ues from the mouth of a Quack Doctor. I do not mean to in&s;inuate, that a di&s;orderly mob are equal to a trained di&s;ciplined body of men; but I mean, that all the e&s;&s;en|tials nece&s;&s;ary to form infantry for real &s;ervice may be ac|quired in a few months.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There cannot be a &s;tronger illu&s;tration of the truth here advanced, than the Pru&s;&s;ian army.&mdash;They are compo&s;ed of about one third of the King's own &s;ubjects, two-thirds foreigners.&mdash;The third, con&s;i&s;ting of his own &s;ubject, are, when the exerci&s;ing &s;ea&s;on is over, (which la&s;ts &s;ix or &s;even weeks) &s;uffered to return to their families, and attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;bandry&mdash;half of the other two-thirds, con&s;i&s;ting of foreigners, are not only permitted, but encouraged to work at their trades in the garri&s;on towns, and never touch a mu&s;ket for the re&s;t of the year, &s;o that, in fact, only one third are, in the modern language, to be called regular Soldiers;&mdash;the&s;e generally make their e&s;cape the fir&s;t opportunity: It may be &s;aid, therefore, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia has gained all his victories with a &s;ort of Militia.</NOTE> I mean that it is very po&s;&s;ible for men to be clothed in red, to be expert in all the tricks of the parade, to call them&s;elves regular troops, and yet, by attaching them&s;elves principally or &s;olely to the tin&s;el

and &s;hew of war, be totally unfit for real &s;ervice.&mdash;This, I am told, is a good deal the ca&s;e of the pre&s;ent Briti&s;h In|fantry: If they can acquit them&s;elves tolerably in the pu|erile reviews exhibited for the amu&s;ement of royal Ma|&s;ters and Mi&s;&s;es in Hyde Park or Wimbledon Common, it is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the late war, &s;ome of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed regular regiments were &s;ent over to this country; they were well dre&s;&s;ed; they were well powdered; they were perfect ma&s;ters of their manual exerci&s;e; they fired together in platoons; but fatal experience taught us, that they knew not how to fight.&mdash;While your Militia were frequently crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, the&s;e regulars were de|feated or baffled for three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in every part of the continent&mdash;at length, indeed (after repeated lo&s;&s;es and di&s;graces) they became excellent troops, but not until they had ab&s;olutely forgotten every thing which, we are a&s;&s;ured, mu&s;t render regulars quite irre&s;i&s;table. The corps &s;ent from this country under General Monkton was, I believe, for its number, one of the be&s;t armies that ever was led to conque&s;t, and yet, if I have been rightly inform|ed, there was not a &s;ingle regiment of them that could go through the manual exerci&s;e, or at be&s;t, they performed it mo&s;t wretchedly.&mdash;It is likewi&s;e &s;aid, that when, after their glorious and rapid conque&s;t of Martinico, they were join|ed by the &s;pruce regiments from Europe; &s;uch was their uncouth appearance, that they were &s;carce honored with the title of Soldiers by tho&s;e Gentlemen. Upon the whole, it is mo&s;t certain, that men may be &s;martly dre&s;&s;ed, keep their arms bright, be called regulars, be expert in all the anticks of a review, and yet be very unfit for real action.&mdash;It is equally certain, that a Militia, by confining them|&s;elves to e&s;&s;entials, by a &s;implification of the nece&s;&s;ary ma|noeuvres, may become, in a very few months, a mo&s;t for|midable infantry.&mdash;The Yeomanry of America have, be|&s;ides, infinite advantages over the pea&s;antry of other coun|tries; they are accu&s;tomed from their infancy to fire arms; they are expert in the u&s;e of them:&mdash;Whereas the lower and middle people of England are, by the tyranny of cer|tain

laws almo&s;t as ignorant in the u&s;e of a mu&s;ket, as they are of the ancient Catepulta. The Americans are likewi&s;e, to a man, &s;kilful in the management of the in|&s;truments nece&s;&s;ary for all military works; &s;uch as &s;pades, pickaxes, hatchets, &amp;c.&mdash;Taking, therefore, all circum|&s;tances into con&s;ideration, there will be no ra&s;hne&s;s in af|firming, that this continent may have formed for action, in three or four months, an hundred thou&s;and infantry: For as to the a&s;&s;ertion of one friendly advi&s;er, <HI>that no more than forty thou&s;and could act to advantage,</HI> I confe&s;s I do not under&s;tand it, nor does he, I believe, under&s;tand him|&s;elf.&mdash;If he means that &s;ixty thou&s;and men cannot be rang|ed in a field capable of containing only forty thou&s;and, we &s;hall all agree with him; but how in the operations of a war upon a va&s;t continent double this number &s;hould be a di&s;advantage, I can have no conception.</P>
<P>LET one &s;imple general plan be adopted for the forma|tion and &s;ubdivi&s;ion of your battalions; let them be in|&s;tructed only in &s;o much of the manual exerci&s;e as to pre|vent confu&s;ion, and accidents in loading and firing; let them be taught to form, to retreat, to advance, to change their front, to rally by their colours; let them be taught to reduce them&s;elves from a line of fire to a line of impre&s;|&s;ion, that is, from two deep to four, &s;ix, or eight.&mdash;This is all &s;o ea&s;y and &s;imple, that it may be acquired in three months. Let &s;ome plan of this &s;ort be adopted, I &s;ay, and there is no doubt but that, in the time I have pre&s;crib|ed, you may have an army on foot of &s;eventy, eighty, or an hundred thou&s;and men, equal to all the &s;ervices of war.</P>
<P>SHOULD this be admitted, it will be &s;till objected, that you have no able officers to conduct you. I do not know that you have; but it is certain that tho&s;e &s;ent to dragoon you have better? I have taken &s;ome pains to inform my&s;elf what me|thods the&s;e gentlemen, &s;aid to be bred to arms, take to qua|lify them&s;elves in a &s;uperior degree for the profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;What is their rotine of in&s;truction?

<P>ANOTHER circum&s;tance, Americans, may be added for your comfort. It has been allowed by &s;ome of the mo&s;t candid of the regulars them&s;elves, that during the la&s;t war upon this continent, your countrymen, the provincial field-officers, were in general more under&s;tanding and capable than their own of the &s;ame rank. But the hi&s;tory of the civil war, in the year 1641, furni&s;hes us with the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tances that excellent officers may be &s;oon formed from Country Gentlemen, Citizens, Lawyers, and Farmers&mdash;The Parliament's army (or as our prie&s;tly writer would all them, the rebellious Republicans) were chiefly com|po&s;ed of this cla&s;s of men. In the beginning of this war, they were treated with the &s;ame affected contempt, and almo&s;t in the &s;ame opprobrious terms as you, the people of America, are by your friendly and decent advi&s;er.</P>

He ex|ecrates the memory of tho&s;e men to whom they may ju&s;t|ly be attributed, but he is per&s;uaded that they never ori|ginated (at lea&s;t in &s;tates of any con&s;iderable extent) in the turbulent di&s;po&s;ition of the people, nor in the arts of demagogues, but in the oppre&s;&s;ion of their rulers, in the wantonne&s;s, folly, pride, or avarice of Kings, Mini&s;ters, or Governors. The Gri<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ers of Switzerland, the Granvels of Holland, the Lauds and Straffords of England, were the undoubted authors of the tragedies acted in their re&s;pec-countries: And if this continent &s;hould be &s;tained with the blood of a &s;ingle citizen, it can never be charged to the unrea&s;onable preten&s;ions of the people, but to the Ber|nards, Hutchin&s;ons, and &s;ome other traitors of a &s;imilar &s;tamp.</P>

influence, and &s;apping your virtue, to take a|way the re&s;t at their lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>THERE now remains, people of America, one con|&s;ideration, which (however it may be taken) I think it my duty to offer. Hi&s;tory tells us that the free &s;tates of Greece, Thebes, Sparta, Athens, and Syracu&s;e, were all in their turns &s;ubjugated by the force or art of ty|rants. They almo&s;t all, in their turns, recovered their liberty and de&s;troyed their tyrants. The fir&s;t act up|on the recovery of their liberty was to demoli&s;h tho&s;e badges of &s;lavery, citadels, &s;trong holds and military tenements; the Switzers did the &s;ame; the people of England (lo&s;t in corruption and lethargy as they are) could never be prevailed upon to &s;uffer barracks a|mong&s;t them; even the courtly Black&s;tone is &s;tartled at the idea. No &s;eparate camps, no barracks, no in|land fortre&s;&s;es, &s;ays he, &s;hould be allowed; in fact, wherever barracks are, freedom cannot be &s;aid to ex|i&s;t, or &s;he exi&s;ts &s;o lamely as &s;carcely to de&s;erve the name.</P>
<P>IT is worth your con&s;ideration, Americans, whether the&s;e badges &s;hould remain or on. I &s;hall now con|clude, brave citizens, with invoking the Almighty God, from whom all virtues flow, to continue you in that &s;pirit of unanimity and vigour which mu&s;t in&s;ure your &s;ucce&s;s, and immortalize you through all ages, as the champions and patrons of the human race.</P>
