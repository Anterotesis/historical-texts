<BIBL>I&s;t. Epi&s;tle C O R. 6th Chap. 9, 10, 11, ver&s;es.</BIBL>
<Q>Know ye not that the Unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abu&s;ers of them&s;elves with Man|kind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, &s;hall inherit the Kingdom of God.&mdash;And &s;uch were &s;ome of you: But ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye are ju&s;tified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God.</Q>

<P>THE Apo&s;tle Paul was, through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, in&s;trumental of do|ing great things at Corinth. It a|bounded in wealth, and this furni&s;hed the means for all kinds of luxury; and mo&s;t heinous and dete&s;table vices were very prevalent among them. The Apo&s;tle, who was zealou&s;ly &s;et for the promoting the cau&s;e of his beloved Lord and Ma&s;ter, came to this city, being encouraged by a vi&s;ion he had, a&s;&s;uring him that God <HI>had much people in that city,</HI> Acts 18. 9, 10. When he came, as infamous as they were for vice, yet it is likely, that he met with good accep|tance among them, and accordingly he made a con|&s;iderable tarry <HI>a year and &s;ix months teaching the word of God among them,</HI> as in the ver&s;e following.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011707_0004_0F881EB09EBA6CB0">
By his great pains and labours, he was in&s;trumen|tal of founding a church of Chri&s;t in that wicked place, and bringing about a great reformation in it. Indeed, notwith&s;tanding all he did, there were yet many things ami&s;s among them, for which he takes occa&s;ion in the run of this epi&s;tle to reprove them.</P>
<P>In the chapter in which is our text, as well as the preceeding, he warns them again&s;t divers heinous &s;ins&mdash;<HI>hypocri&s;y, fornication, idolatry, covetou&s;ne&s;s, railery, drunkenne&s;s, extortion, pro&s;ecuting others needle&s;ly and vexatiou&s;ly in the law..</HI> With re&s;pect to &s;ome among them, the&s;e vices were &s;till indulged, notwith&s;tanding they were directly oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, which he had been preaching among them, and inculcating upon them. To en|force the warning he had given again&s;t the&s;e vices, he adds as in the words I at fir&s;t read.&mdash;<HI>Know ye not, that the unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the king|dom of God?</HI> And then he immediately enumer|ates divers great and mo&s;t heinous iniquities, the in|dulgence of which would effectually exclude them the kingdom of God.&mdash;The heavenly kingdom, or the kingdom of glory, which God has prepared for the righteous, and into which their gracious &s;pirits a&s;cend in the day of death, and into which Je&s;us Chri&s;t will publickly invite them in their whole man, at the la&s;t day, &s;aying unto them&mdash;<HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</HI> Matt. 25. 34&mdash;This is the kingdom that the apo&s;tle intends, when he tells the Corinthians, that <HI>the unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God.</HI> By the caveat, the apo&s;tle enters here, it looks as though there were &s;ome among them, at lea&s;t, who imagined, that not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="7" REF="011707_0005_0F881EB15ECB9B20">
their indulging to &s;uch iniquities, yet that on the whole they &s;hould inherit that kingdom. But, &s;ays he, <HI>be not deceived,</HI> do not flatter your&s;elves in this matter, do not entertain a thought of going to the kingdom of heaven, if you live in unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s, or in any of the&s;e in&s;tances of unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, <HI>fornication, idolatry, adultery,</HI> &amp;c. It is the grande&s;t delu&s;ion and &s;elf-deception that can be, to entertain the lea&s;t thought or expectation of being admitted to &s;o glorious a happine&s;s, at the clo&s;e of an unrighteous, ungodly life. Before I proceed any further, I would remark here&mdash;That it is no un|common thing, for unrighteous per&s;ons to deceive them&s;elves, that they &s;hall on the whole inherit the kingdom of God; though they indulge them&s;elves in the mo&s;t heinous and dete&s;table abominations, &s;uch as are enumerated in our text, they flatter them|&s;elves, that they &s;hall be happy at la&s;t. With re|&s;pect to &s;ome indeed, God is not in all their tho'ts; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid, with re&s;pect to a &s;tate of future rewards and puni&s;hments. The&s;e great re|alities are bani&s;hed far away from their minds.</P>
<P>But others may at times have &s;ome thoughts of God, and of heaven and hell. And yet notwith|&s;tanding by their heinous vices, they are <HI>trea&s;uring up wrath again&s;t the day of wrath,</HI> po&s;ting head|long to de&s;truction. Yet &s;uch is their amazing &s;tupidity, that they entertain a hope, that it &s;hall be well with them upon the whole, that they &s;hall go to that heavenly kingdom which God has prepared and promi&s;ed to the righteous. And wherefore is it, that they entertain &s;uch a hope? Why, it is partly owing to this, that they imagine that God takes no notice of their conduct and behaviour, or that
<PB N="8" REF="011707_0006_0F881EB21EC87288">
he connives at it, &s;o making him altogether &s;uch an one as them&s;elves. And partly, becau&s;e they ima|gine that God is made up wholly of mercy, and that therefore, he will not at la&s;t find it in his heart to puni&s;h them; that he will &s;et a&s;ide his ju&s;tice, and di&s;pen&s;e with the threatnings which he has de|nounced again&s;t the wicked, e&s;pecially as there is an al&s;ufficient Saviour of his own providing, and a &s;ufficiency of merit in his blood to pardon and &s;ave them; and con&s;idering al&s;o, that he is rea|dy to pardon &s;inners, and that many great and high-handed &s;inners have been the &s;ubjects of his pardoning mercy. The &s;elf-deception of &s;inners, chargeable oftentimes with mo&s;t heinous and atro|cious crimes, is no doubt, in a great many in&s;tances, grounded upon &s;uch imaginations as the&s;e.</P>
<P>But that the&s;e are vain imaginations, is obvious at the very fir&s;t glance.&mdash;I might &s;how at large, would the time admit of it, that God is ab&s;olutely and ne|ce&s;&s;arily omni&s;cient, and con&s;equently that every being and every thing, throughout the whole uni|ver&s;e, is naked and open to his view; and particu|larly, that he has a mo&s;t exact and critical know|ledge, without the lea&s;t mi&s;take, or indeed po&s;&s;ibility of it, of men and all their thoughts, words and actions. You may, at your lei&s;ure, &s;ee in confir|mation of what I have now &s;aid, the 139th P&s;alm, at the beginning.&mdash;I might &s;how al&s;o that God be|ing infinitely and immutably holy, cannot po&s;&s;ibly connive at &s;in, the lea&s;t &s;in, for this would be to connive at that which directly &s;trikes at his glorious crown and dignity, that pours contempt upon his authority and law, and upon all his adorable attri|butes. Sin is directly oppo&s;ite to his nature, law
<PB N="9" REF="011707_0007_0F881EB2DEB8FD80">
and government. And what &s;ort of idea mu&s;t we entertain of God, if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that he in the lea&s;t connived at it, or was indifferent about it? Verily that is a clear dictate of rea&s;on as well as of the Bible that <HI>he is of purer eyes than to behold ini|quity.</HI>&mdash;And further, although it is true, that God is infinite in mercy, and has given the mo&s;t glorious proofs and evidences hereof to mankind, yet it is true al&s;o, that he is infinite in his ju&s;tice, and that this &s;tands upon the rights of his throne, and for the maintenance of his righteous authority and his holy law, inviolate. This is abundantly evident, in the whole of that great affair <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the redemption of the world by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In the death and &s;acrifice of that glorious per&s;on, we have a mo&s;t &s;triking proof of the &s;trict regard God had for the honor of his ju&s;tice, and this at the &s;ame time that his mercy had the mo&s;t &s;hining, il|lu&s;trious di&s;play; mercy for ever to be admir'd and ador'd by &s;aints and angels. Mercy rejoic'd again&s;t judgment in providing &s;uch a glorious Saviour, as the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is, and &s;o putting &s;inners in a capacity of being &s;aved; yet it is a vain imagination for any &s;inners to think, that God will &s;et a&s;ide his ju&s;tice, and &s;uffer the glory of this perfection to be eclip&s;ed, &s;o as that they &s;hall be the &s;ubjects of his mercy either here or hereafter, they continuing in their unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, counteracting his law and go|vernment, by their vicious practices. And &s;o I may &s;ay further, that Chri&s;t is a mighty redeemer, able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, yet <HI>he gave him&s;elf,</HI> or offered him&s;elf in &s;acrifice, that he might redeem &s;inners <HI>from</HI> their &s;ins, from the power, pollution and guilt of &s;in, as well as from the penal effects of it.
<PB N="10" REF="011707_0008_0F881EB39EB6BF48">
Con&s;equently then, they can have no benefit by his death and &s;acrifice, if they are not redeemed from iniquity, in the manner now &s;aid. And certainly, they are not thus redeemed, if they live in the practice of iniquity. Nothing can be more plain than this.&mdash;And I will only add in a word here&mdash;That &s;inners that have obtained mercy from God, and looked for his mercy unto eternal life, have ob|tained it, not as hardned &s;inners, bent upon their ungodly practices, but as qualified &s;ubjects of it, receiving the &s;prinkling of the blood of Je&s;us, and the &s;anctification of the holy Spirit. So that with|out further enlarging here&mdash;It is with good rea&s;on, that the apo&s;tle declares in our text, that <HI>the unrigh|teous &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God,</HI> and ac|cordingly enters a caution to all unrighteous ones, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e he here enumerates, again&s;t &s;elf-deception: <HI>Be not deceived,</HI> for no unrighteous per|&s;on &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Now here let me a&s;k, what it is that gives a title to the kingdom of God? Verily, not any thing in the creature; for in him&s;elf he is utterly unworthy. The mo&s;t improved chri&s;tian, has no title to heaven, and the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of it, upon the foundation of his own per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s. If he attains to ever &s;o high degrees in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet after all he is an unprofitable &s;ervant. Let him be as eminent a chri&s;tian as was the apo&s;tle Paul, yet he has no claim upon God, and may not pretend to any title to heavenly happine&s;s. Con&s;idering the imper|fection of per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s in the very be&s;t, it is impo&s;&s;ible, according to the con&s;titution of God's moral government, that &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s can give a title to the heavenly kingdom. The truth
<PB N="11" REF="011707_0009_0F881EB45EBFDB50">
is, that nothing &s;hort of the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, which is imputed to the real chri&s;tian, can give a title to the heavenly kingdom and glory.</P>
<P>The proof of this, I might go on abundantly to confirm, were it nece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent. Now then, what &s;hall we &s;ay of the unrighteous? What title can they pretend to the heavenly kingdom, when they are, not only without the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, but have not &s;o much as a per&s;onal righ|teou&s;ne&s;s to produce and plead in the ca&s;e? They are without God and without Chri&s;t in the world. What title then can they have to the kingdom of heaven? And what an ab&s;urd thing mu&s;t it be in &s;uch, to entertain the lea&s;t expectation of finally being admitted thereinto? The impo&s;&s;ibility of their being &s;o, at once appears from the bare mentioning of the ca&s;e. I would a&s;k further&mdash;What it is that gives a meetne&s;s for that kingdom? God that dwelleth there is holy; angels are holy; all the inhabitants of it are holy; the exerci&s;es and employments thereof are all holy; and, as it is written, <HI>Without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord,</HI> Heb. 12. 14. Unholy ones are utterly un|like the holy God: There is as much contrariety in their natures, to the nature of God, as there is between light and darkne&s;s: <HI>And what communion hath light with darkne&s;s?</HI> An unholy per&s;on, could we &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch an one could be admitted to heaven at la&s;t, could have no true enjoyment of the holy God. For likene&s;s to God is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, in order to the enjoyment of God. Being unholy, a creature could have no ta&s;te or reli&s;h for the fellow&s;hip and &s;ociety of holy angels,
<PB N="12" REF="011707_0010_0F881EB51EC8C878">
or for their exerci&s;es and employments. Heaven, t o unholy ones, would be a confinement to them, and they would even wi&s;h they were out of it, there being &s;uch an utter unlikene&s;s to every thing there, &s;uch an utter di&s;reli&s;h to every object and every exerci&s;e there. If now upon the whole here, unrighteous, unholy ones, have no meetne&s;s or fit|ne&s;s for the heavenly kingdom, what wretched &s;elf-deception is it in &s;uch, to entertain the lea&s;t thought or expectation of at la&s;t being received thereinto? And were they to con&s;ider what heaven is, the objects, the &s;ociety, the employments and enjoy|ments of it, it &s;eems as though none of this character, and while continuing in this &s;tate, could entertain the lea&s;t thought of going there at la&s;t. But they have, it is likely in many in&s;tances, carnal notions of it, as though it was nothing more than a fine &s;plendid city, furni&s;hed with objects adapted to gratify the animal &s;en&s;es, having no higher ideas of it, than of a mahometan paradi&s;e. But let their imaginations be what they will&punc; let their expectations of attaining to it be ever &s;o &s;anguine, yet it may be depended upon, if any dependance may be placed upon what the apo&s;tle declares in our text, that <HI>&s;uch &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Now &s;omething more is intended by the apo&s;tle in this declaration, than is expre&s;&s;ed. He intends not only that they &s;hall be excluded the kingdom of glory, but that they &s;hall be doomed to the king|dom of darkne&s;s. This will unavoidably be their ca&s;e. Abundance of pa&s;&s;ages in the book of God might be produced were there need of it, which fully declare that the unrighteous &s;hall at la&s;t be &s;hut up in the pri&s;on of hell. And there they will endure
<PB N="13" REF="011707_0011_0F881EB5DEAF7800">
the wrath of God, yea, the exceeding fiercene&s;s of the wrath of almighty God, through a long eternity. There they will be companions with devils, who now entice them and hurry them on in wickedne&s;s, with the malicious view of bringing them to their place of torments. There they will, as do the de|vils, bla&s;pheme the God of heaven, and gnaw their tongues for pain, without the lea&s;t re&s;pite, the lea&s;t gleam of hope, or ray of light. When millions of millions of ages are rolled away, in which they have been grapling and conflicting with the exceeding fiercene&s;s of the wrath of omnipotent God, &s;till there is a long, boundle&s;s eternity before them, and they are no nearer to an end of their torments, than the very moment they entred upon them. This will be the mi&s;erable condition at la&s;t of the unrigh|teous. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe, or even to con|ceive a ten thou&s;andth part of their future mi&s;era|blene&s;s and wretchedne&s;s in the bottomle&s;s pit; and this, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;olemn and &s;triking re|pre&s;entations we have of it in the word of God.&mdash;<HI>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even accord|ing to thy fear, &s;o is thy wrath.</HI> It exceeds all the mo&s;t fearful apprehen&s;ions, that may at any time be entertained of it. This wrath is mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly com|ing upon all the children of di&s;obedience. God will come at la&s;t to &s;hew his wrath and make his power known, in the &s;ight of all intelligencies, upon &s;uch ve&s;&s;els of wrath, as have fitted them&s;elves for de&s;truction. All tho&s;e heinous &s;inners the apo&s;tle mentions in our text, <HI>fornicators, adulterers, thieves, drunkards,</HI> &amp;c. &s;hall have their portion at la&s;t in the lake which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd death. Not a &s;ingle one &s;hall e&s;cape, however any may flatter them&s;elves now that they &s;hall do &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="011707_0012_0F881EB69EB04AF0">
I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve here&mdash;That there are many, who, though they may not &s;tand chargeable with &s;uch gro&s;s open iniquities as the text leads us to con&s;ider, yet, properly come under the character of the unrighteous. Although their outward con|duct may be decent before men, yea although in many in&s;tances, they may practi&s;e the forms of god|line&s;s, yet they are without the power of it; they have a name to live, but are dead, under the power of carnal minds that are enmity again&s;t God, fal&s;e and hypocritical in all their tran&s;actions with him, have never had any real, thorough &s;en&s;e of &s;in, nor godly mourning for it. In &s;hort, their hearts are e&s;tranged from God, they are earthly and &s;en&s;ual in their di&s;po&s;itions and affections. Such as the&s;e, though they may make a goodly appearance before the world, are yet in the &s;ight of the holy and heart-&s;earching God, <HI>unrighteous.</HI> And with re&s;pect to the&s;e al&s;o it may be &s;aid, that they &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God. No unclean, unholy thing &s;hall enter there. <HI>All unrighteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;in,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, 1 John 5. 17. This takes in tho&s;e, that I have now mentioned. And as it is el&s;e|where &s;aid, <HI>Sin is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law,</HI> eternal death is the penalty annexed to this law. And this penalty will be inflicted upon all the unrighteous at la&s;t. All the&s;e things &s;tand in clo&s;e connection with each other. And accordingly, <HI>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven, again&s;t all the ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men,</HI> Rom. 1. 18. Again&s;t <HI>all</HI> unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, whether &s;ecret or open. And far be it from any to fix the charge of cruelty upon God, in inflicting his everla&s;ting wrath upon unrigh|teous, ungodly ones. For it will not be a mere act of power&punc; but he will proceed upon the rules of &s;trict
<PB N="15" REF="011707_0013_0F881EB75ED259B0">
ju&s;tice. Unrighteous ones are enemies again&s;t his great and &s;acred maje&s;ty, they do the abominable thing which his &s;oul hates; they counteract his au|thority and holy law, and virtually bid him defiance. They break through the mo&s;t &s;acred ties of grati|tude, for his abundant goodne&s;s and grace towards them, e&s;pecially in that marvellous in&s;tance of it, his &s;ending his only-begotten &s;on to redeem them by the blood of his cro&s;s. They rebel both again&s;t the light of nature and the light of divine revelation, and take part with the grand enemy of God, and of all righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>What mon&s;trous vilene&s;s now is it, to act &s;uch a part towards the adorable maje&s;ty of heaven and earth, who is &s;o infinitely excellent, and &s;o infinitely worthy of the highe&s;t regards of all intelligent crea|tures, who are under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to live entirely devoted to his &s;ervice and glory! Can it then be otherwi&s;e, but that he mu&s;t behold the un|righteous, wicked conduct of his creatures, with the highe&s;t anger and re&s;entment? And mu&s;t he not in honour to his great name, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his throne, the magnifying his law, and for the a&s;&s;erting and vindicating his holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and truth, manife&s;t his anger and re&s;entment towards them? Mu&s;t he not on the whole, puni&s;h them ac|cording to their de&s;erts? And con&s;idering his in|finite maje&s;ty and dignity, mu&s;t he not everla&s;tingly puni&s;h them? It is certain that &s;in is an infinite evil, if we con&s;ider the object again&s;t whom it is com|mitted, the infinite God, and it de&s;erves an infinite puni&s;hment. And although according to the diffe|rent aggravations of men's wickedne&s;s, there will be different degrees of puni&s;hment in hell, [<HI>with &s;ome,</HI>

we read <HI>it will be more tolerable than with others,</HI> Matt. 11. 24.] yet as to the duration of it, it will be alike as to all; <HI>an everla&s;ting de&s;truction from God's pre&s;ence, and the glory of his power.</HI> This will be inflicted at la&s;t <HI>upon all that know not God, and who have not obeyed the go&s;pel of his &s;on.</HI> And there will be no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in God, but he and his throne will be pure and guiltle&s;s.

<P>I will only &s;ay in a word here, when the apo&s;tle declares in our text, that the <HI>unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God,</HI> he is to be under|&s;tood, as intending tho&s;e that continue in their un|righteou&s;ne&s;s to the la&s;t. Not but that there have been many unrighteous ones, who have indulged them&s;elves in the mo&s;t heinous vices, &s;uch as the apo&s;tle makes mention of, who have experienced a ble&s;&s;ed change both of &s;tate and nature, and &s;o from being children of wrath and heirs of hell, have be|come the children of God, and heirs to the heavenly kingdom, and in their &s;pirits have been put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their inheritance, when they have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed hence by death.</P>
<P>And this leads me now to di&s;cour&s;e upon the latter part of our text.&mdash;<HI>And &s;uch were &s;ome of you.</HI> Such heinous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors as I have mention|ed, &s;ome of you have been. The word in the ori|ginal, is emphatical&mdash;<HI>&s;uch things</HI> were &s;ome of you, &s;uch wretched, mon&s;trous creatures, who by the indulgence of &s;uch dete&s;table abominations, degraded
<PB N="17" REF="011707_0015_0F881EB8DEB1E130">
your&s;elves below the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. Notwith|&s;tanding which ye &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God. And why? Becau&s;e <HI>ye are wa&s;hed, &s;anctified, ju&s;tified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the &s;pirit of our God.</HI></P>
<P>I might now enter into a large field, in treating up|on tho&s;e great and ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings here &s;poken of. But the time will only allow me to di&s;cour&s;e upon them in a &s;ummary way.</P>
<P>When the apo&s;tle tells the Corinthians, who had been abominably vile and ungodly,&mdash;<HI>ye are wa&s;hed,</HI> he intends &s;omething more than their having been baptized into the chri&s;tian name by the wa&s;hing of water. He intends their having been regenerated. This, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> regeneration, is &s;poken of as a <HI>wa&s;hing.</HI> So we read Titus 3. 4. of <HI>the wa&s;hing of regeneration.</HI> And being regenerated, they were accordingly, as he goes on to &s;peak, <HI>&s;anctified and ju&s;tified.</HI> "Here" (as one ob&s;erves) "is a rhetorical change of the natural order: Sanctification is mentioned before ju&s;tifica|tion." They are in their nature different; but con&s;idering their clo&s;e connection, we need not be critical here.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tification is a foren&s;ic term, or a term borrowed from courts of ju&s;tice. When the apo&s;tle tells the Corinthians, <HI>they were ju&s;tified,</HI> he intends in general, that they were acquitted from guilt, pardoned by God, the father of mercies, the lawgiver and judge of mankind, even as criminals and malefactors &s;ome|times have been, by their gracious &s;overeign's rever|&s;ing the &s;entence of condemnation they were under for the violation of the laws, the guilt thereby contracted, and the penalty incurred. Ju&s;tified per&s;ons are di&s;|charged
<PB N="18" REF="011707_0016_0F881EB99EABD650">
from their guilt, the ju&s;tice of God has no demands upon them. Their &s;ins are blotted out. God hides his face from them, and remembers them not again&s;t them, however numerous they have been, and though of a &s;carlet and crim&s;on colour. He receives them to favour, and looks upon them as <HI>righ|teous;</HI> for &s;o they are in a legal &s;en&s;e. "Go&s;pel-ju&s;tification", (as one ob&s;erves) <Q>doth not barely take off the guilt of &s;in and rever&s;e the &s;entence of condemnation by a pardon, and &s;o re&s;tore us to a &s;tate of probation which might i&s;&s;ue in a &s;tate of condemnation again; it likewi&s;e pronounces us righteous, and brings us into a &s;tate of pre&s;ent and per&s;onal acceptance with God to eternal life, whereby, according to the con&s;titution of the go&s;|pel, we have a &s;ure, an actual and abiding claim to it. It brings us into a new and compleat title to life, beyond what man ever had before, and into greater nearne&s;s to God, and higher dignities and ble&s;&s;ings in his favour and love, than belong|ed to the fir&s;t covenant.</Q> <HI>The free gift comes upon us to ju&s;tification of life,</HI> Rom. 5. 18. <HI>And whom God ju&s;tifies, them he al&s;o glorifies,</HI> chap. 8. 30.</P>
<P>Such a ble&s;&s;ed alteration as this was made in the &s;tate of &s;ome of the Corinthians, who had been a|bandoned to the mo&s;t flagitious practices; acquitted from guilt, delivered from condemnation, made righ|teous, re&s;tored to favour and entitled to life. And wherefore was it &s;o? Why, as in the text, it was <HI>in the name of the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> or for his &s;ake, in virtue of his atonement by the blood of the cro&s;s, by which he made peace, put away &s;in, and brought in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is every way adequate to the demands of
<PB N="19" REF="011707_0017_0F881EBA5EB76740">
the law and ju&s;tice of God. Faith lays hold of this righteou&s;ne&s;s and it is imputed to the guilty &s;in|ner for the ju&s;tification of life. This is the language of the go&s;pel. And con&s;equently now, I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve&mdash;It is not owing nor can it be owing, either in whole or in part, to any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;inner's own, that he is ju&s;tified before God; but &s;olely to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of our great Redeemer, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But now, be&s;ides &s;uch a happy change of &s;tate in the Corinthians, as their being ju&s;tified, they ex|perienced al&s;o a happy change of nature: <HI>Ye are &s;anctified.</HI> This, as was hinted before, though differ|ent from their ju&s;tification, was and always is in near connection with it. Being &s;anctified they were brought into a conformity to the holy God, made partakers of a divine nature, all the powers of their &s;ouls renewed, and a holy, heavenly turn given to them. In the comprehen&s;ive repre&s;entation of the apo&s;tle, 2 Cor. 5. 17. <HI>Being in Chri&s;t, they were new creatures, old things were pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things became new.</HI> Now they were brought to love the ble&s;&s;ed God, to love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to love the divine law, to hate &s;in, to mourn for it, to for&s;ake it, and to con&s;ecrate them&s;elves to God, to glorify him in their bodies and &s;pirits which are his. Now they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, moulded into the genius of his go&s;pel, and had a pre|vailing di&s;po&s;ition and bent of heart to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world, as the grace of God which bringeth &s;alvation teacheth. This in brief we are to under&s;tand by their being <HI>&s;anctified.</HI> And what a happy and mo&s;t de&s;irable change was this! They were now conformed to the holy God,
<PB N="20" REF="011707_0018_0F881EBB1EBCD5E0">
and the holy Je&s;us, and brought into a meetne&s;s for the high and holy heavens, for the enjoyment of the holy God, for the &s;ociety of holy angels, and for their holy and &s;ublime exerci&s;es and employments.</P>
<P>But now they them&s;elves were not the authors of this &s;anctification: No, <HI>ye are &s;anctified by the Spirit of our God.</HI> So we el&s;ewhere read of <HI>the &s;anctification of the Spirit</HI>&mdash;of <HI>the renewing of the holy Gho&s;t.</HI> The ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God, who is the &s;pirit of grace and holine&s;s, he is the author or efficient cau&s;e of the &s;anctification of &s;ouls. This is abundantly the language of the in&s;pired oracles. And all chri&s;tian graces and virtues, are &s;poken of as <HI>fruits of the &s;pirit:</HI> Fora&s;much as he by his gracious influences implants the &s;eeds of them in the heart, cau&s;es them to take root there, to &s;pring up and bring forth fruit to the prai&s;e and glory of God.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only ju&s;t add here, that we may with pro|priety &s;peak of being &s;anctified, not only by the influence and agency of the Spirit of our God, but of being &s;anctified <HI>in the name of the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> or in virtue of his atonement. For it is to be con&s;idered, that the Spirit in his &s;anctifying influences is the pur|cha&s;e of the death of Chri&s;t. Had he not offered him&s;elf a &s;acrifice to God, it would have been im|po&s;&s;ible that &s;inners &s;hould ever be recovered to the image of God, or become holy, as well as brought into a &s;tate of pardon and ju&s;tification. Accordingly we read of being <HI>&s;anctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> 1 Cor. 1. 2. And in the 30th ver. the apo&s;tle gives us a com|prehen&s;ive view of the whole of man's redemption, pre&s;ent and future, the whole of it, taking its ri&s;e from the mediation of Chri&s;t. <HI>But of him, are ye
<PB N="21" REF="011707_0019_0F881EBBDEA882C0">
in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us, wi&s;dom, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;anctification, and redemption.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have in &s;ome mea&s;ure gone through with the whole of the in&s;pired pa&s;&s;age I at fir&s;t read to di&s;cour&s;e upon, upon this &s;orrowful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>And now from the things that have been &s;poken, I may take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, with what a con|&s;picuous and admirable light the wi&s;dom and the grace of God, &s;hines forth in the work of man's re|demption. A better righteou&s;ne&s;s than his own is provided, in which he may with &s;afety appear before the holy and righteous God, both here and hereafter: And effectual provi&s;ion made for his recovery from his pollution and degeneracy and re&s;toration to a &s;tate of true rectitude and moral purity. So that notwith&s;tanding his guilt and vilene&s;s, he may not only e&s;cape future wrath and perdition, but have a &s;ure title to and meetne&s;s for cele&s;tial glory and hap|pine&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is all of God, of his contriving and effecting, and how gloriou&s;ly is his wi&s;dom and his grace di&s;played and illu&s;trated herein!</P>
<P>Again,&mdash;What obligations are we under to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for undertaking this work, and carrying it into effect! Glorified &s;aints will through eternal ages adore and prai&s;e him for his loving them and wa&s;h|ing them from their &s;ins in his own blood, and in rai&s;ing them to &s;it together with him in heavenly places. <HI>Worthy is the Lamb that was &s;lain, to re|ceive power and riches and wi&s;dom and &s;trength and honour and glory and ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> Rev. 5. 12.</P>
<P>Again,&mdash;What prai&s;es are due to God, from tho&s;e who have been made partakers of the great redemp|tion
<PB N="22" REF="011707_0020_0F881EBC9EA74658">
by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who have obtained the ju&s;ti|fication of life, and the &s;anctification of the Spirit, and &s;o have a &s;ure title to and a proper meetne&s;s for the happine&s;s and glory of heaven! Well may the high prai&s;es of God be in their mouths for his rich grace and mercy towards them. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name be all the glory.</P>
<P>Nextly,&mdash;We may hence &s;ee, that redeemed ones are the mo&s;t happy and ble&s;&s;ed ones upon the earth. For their &s;ins are blotted out, their guilt pardoned and done away. Being in Chri&s;t, no condemnation belongs to them. They have on them the image of God. And God is a Father to them, and loves them as dear children, has provided a glorious in|heritance for them in the highe&s;t heavens, and will by and by put them into the full and everla&s;t|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. What are all the pomps and &s;plenders of the world, all its wealth, honours and plea&s;ures, in compare with all this? Verily no more than the common pebbles to the mo&s;t brilliant dia|monds, or the lonely cottage of the beggar, to the magnificent palaces of princes and nobles.</P>
<P>La&s;tly,&mdash;We may hence &s;ee, that the vile&s;t &s;in|ners, may obtain the riche&s;t &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, &s;uch as we have been &s;peaking of, the ju&s;tification of life, and the &s;anctification of the Spirit, and as the i&s;&s;ue of all, eternal glorification in heaven.&mdash;</P>
<P>We have an example of this in &s;ome among the Corinthians. Notwith&s;tanding their mon&s;trous and mo&s;t dete&s;table vices, which expo&s;ed them to the damnation of hell, and which would have irrecover|ably &s;unk them down into it, had a provoked God wholly departed from them and given them up, yet
<PB N="23" REF="011707_0021_0F881EBD5EBEDD68">
they were ju&s;tified and &s;anctified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God, and &s;o brought to &s;hare in the glorious redemption by Chri&s;t both pre&s;ent and future. So that we may never de&s;pair of the mo&s;t heinous &s;inners, if they are as infamous, as &s;ome of the Corinthians were that are &s;poken of in our text, of their being brought home to God and obtaining &s;alvation. Nor may &s;inners them&s;elves, let them have ever &s;o afflicting, pungent a &s;en&s;e of their guilt, their mi&s;ery and ill-de&s;erts, de&s;pair hereof, &s;ince thus it has been with others. The merits of Chri&s;t's precious blood, and the vital influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit can as effectu|ally reach them, as the abominable Corinthians or any other the mo&s;t atrocious &s;inners. And in this ca&s;e they will be delivered from the lowe&s;t hell, and be among the number of the redeemed of the Lord in the kingdom of glory.</P>
<P>I have cho&s;en the &s;ubject I have been di&s;cour&s;ing upon, mainly with a view to your in&s;truction and benefit, <HI>poor man!</HI> who art under a &s;entence of con|demnation, this day to be executed upon you. We have called this &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly, that you might once more before you die, have the opportu|nity of having public, fervent prayers offered up to God on your behalf; and receiving in&s;truction and coun&s;el in tho&s;e things which concern your everla&s;t|ing well-being. While you have attended the pub|lic wor&s;hip of God, &s;ince your condemnation, very &s;olemn and weighty have been the in&s;tructions and coun&s;els you have received, and &s;o they have been in a more private manner: And frequent and fervent &s;upplications have been offered up to the God of heaven for mercy to your precious
<PB N="24" REF="011707_0022_0F881EBE1EB59A50">
and immortal &s;oul. You have had a con&s;iderable &s;pace &s;ince your condemnation to prepare for this &s;olemn day, and for the &s;olemn hour of death ju&s;t before you. And as this is the la&s;t op|portunity you will ever have to attend to the public in&s;tructions of God's word, &s;ee that you give a dili|gent and earne&s;t heed to what may be now &s;poken to you in the name of the Lord.&mdash;</P>
<P>I would be far from upbraiding you with your wickedne&s;s: However, from the crime you have been convicted of, and for which you have been &s;en|tenced to die, you mu&s;t be very &s;en&s;ible that your character is pointed out in the black catalogue of &s;inners mentioned in my text. Among other atro|cious &s;inners, who &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God, the apo&s;tle mentions <HI>thieves.</HI> And were you chargeable with no other crime than that of theft, this alone would be &s;ufficient to exclude you the kingdom of God. For this is a direct breach of an expre&s;s commandment of God. <HI>Thou &s;halt not &s;teal,</HI> Exod. 20. 15. And only the violation of this com|mandment is an argument of rebellion again&s;t the Lord, a de&s;pi&s;ing his authority and his law, and there is an infinite evil in it, and it de&s;erves an infinite puni&s;hment. You have had &s;olemn warnings a|gain&s;t this vice, in the public puni&s;hments you have been brought to; but you pre&s;umed to go on not|with&s;tanding, hardning your &s;elf again&s;t God and his law, and the laws of man, as though you could pro&s;per. You have di&s;regarded God and his threat|nings, and the judgment to come. You for&s;ook God, and God for&s;ook you. You would have none of God, and &s;o he gave you up unto your own heart's lu&s;ts, and to walk in your own coun&s;els. And what is the di&s;mal effect of it? Why, you have
<PB N="25" REF="011707_0023_0F881EBEDEA1CFE8">
been brought before the tribunal of man, and have been &s;entenced to die before the time. And the &s;o|lemn day is now come&mdash;and preparation is made for your execution. The grave has opened its mouth to receive you, and you will pre&s;ently be laid in it, while your &s;pirit &s;hall go to the world of &s;pirits.&mdash;You are now hovering upon the brink of eternity, and will pre&s;ently be in it. O what an awful &s;itua|tion is this! But yet though the wrath of God is revealed from heaven again&s;t all the ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men, and you mu&s;t be &s;en|&s;ible that you are de&s;erving of it, yet through the riches of God's grace in Chri&s;t, you may e&s;cape it, and be received to the kingdom of glory. And if you are intere&s;ted in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and renewed and &s;anctified by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, you may die in the firm faith and hope of being &s;o.&mdash;And let me tell you, that if you are in a ju&s;tified, &s;anctified &s;tate, you have been awakned to &s;ee your wretched, guilty, mi&s;erable condition as a &s;inner, been led to &s;ee what an evil and bit|ter thing &s;in is, not merely as you have expo&s;ed your&s;elf to the &s;word of civil ju&s;tice, and to the everla&s;ting wrath of God; but principally, becau&s;e you have acted a vile, rebellious, ungrateful part towards the glorious Maje&s;ty of heaven, who in numberle&s;s in&s;tances has been good and kind and merciful to you; and your heart is broken and contrite on account hereof: And you have been brought to &s;ee that you are without help and &s;trength in your&s;elf, that you have nothing to recommend you to God, and that he might ju&s;tly make you a monument of his everla&s;ting wrath, becau&s;e of your heinous wickedne&s;s; but yet that there is hope for you&mdash;that there is a glorious ful|ne&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="011707_0024_0F881EBF9EA55258">
in Chri&s;t.&mdash;You have been led to believe in him as an al&s;ufficient Saviour, and to embrace him as the Lord your righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to tru&s;t your whole &s;oul upon his infinite merits. And there|fore have found a great and mighty change of heart; that you e&s;teem and love the ble&s;&s;ed God &s;upremely and for his own incomparable excellencies as well as benefits&mdash;that Chri&s;t is precious to your &s;oul, that you love the law of God, and that &s;in which is oppo&s;ite to it is mo&s;t hateful to you&mdash;that you heartily bow to God and have a &s;upreme re|gard to his glory, and fervent charity towards men, and that after all you freely acknowledge your&s;elf an unprofitable &s;ervant, and look for eternal life as the free gift of God, of his rich and glorious grace through Je&s;us Chri&s;t the only mediator between God and man.</P>
<P>It is no proper &s;ea&s;on for any one to flatter you, or for you to flatter your&s;elf. Your eternal all de|pends upon your finding matters thus with you, as I have now &s;aid. Look critically and thoroughly and impartially into your&s;elf, and &s;ee how it is with you. It is an awful thing for any one, e&s;pecially&punc; at the la&s;t, as is the cafe with you, to deceive him|&s;elf, and think he is &s;omething, when he is nothing, from high hopes of heaven, to find him&s;elf at death, &s;inking down into the lowe&s;t hell. A mi&s;take here is irreparable.</P>
<P>It is our hearts de&s;ire and prayer to God, that though you mu&s;t die this day an ignominious death, yet that you may die in a &s;tate of favour with God, intere&s;ted in the precious merits of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, and that you may have the comfortable,
<PB N="27" REF="011707_0025_0F881EC05EACEF90">
&s;ub&s;tantial evidences hereof, and that your &s;oul may go to be at re&s;t with God, and be joined this day to the &s;ociety of &s;aints and angels in the kingdom of glory.</P>
<P>Now that you are about retiring from this place, and will have a few moments left you, pro&s;trate your&s;elf before the throne of God's mercy, &s;pread your &s;ins and di&s;tre&s;&s;es before him; cry to him with im|portunity, for the exerci&s;e of his mercy towards you, that he would &s;hine into your &s;oul with the light of his ble&s;&s;ed countenance, and enable you to meet death with all the &s;olemn circum&s;tances attending it, with a holy courage, and that in the fatal mo|ment you may with a firm faith re&s;ign your im|mortal &s;pirit into the hands of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, &s;aying with Stephen, <HI>Lord Je&s;us receive my &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>So now, on the whole, we earne&s;tly recommend you to the grace of God and to the mercy of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, even unto eternal life.</P>
<P>And now, Brethren! We may here &s;ee the bit|ter fruits and effects of indulged wickedne&s;s.&mdash;Overmuch wickedne&s;s tends to an immature death, &s;ometimes by the &s;word of civil ju&s;tice being drawn upon the committers of it, as in the in&s;tance before us, and in the in&s;tance we had in this place but a|bout two years ago, as well as in other in&s;tances; and partly al&s;o as many vices tend by a natural cau&s;ality to &s;horten men's days upon earth. But then this is not the wor&s;t of it, for it tends to eter|nal death and de&s;truction, as has been &s;hown in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e. O then, how ought every one, young and old, to take warning by the exam|ples of others, and &s;hun the paths of vice, and of
<PB N="28" REF="011707_0026_0F881EC11EB3F858">
the de&s;troyer! Let every &s;inner immediately repent and turn to God, and fly to Je&s;us who &s;aves from &s;in, and delivers from the wrath to come; and henceforth live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world, that &s;o he may be happy in the favour of God here, and at la&s;t be received to the kingdom of glory. And O that all I&s;rael may hear and fear and do no more &s;o wickedly!</P>
<P>And in a word&mdash;May all that attend the execu|tion of this poor man, lift up their hearts in fervent prayer for him, that God would di&s;play the riches of his grace in his everla&s;ting &s;alvation. And may the minds of all pre&s;ent here and in this place this day, &s;olemnized upon &s;uch an affecting occa&s;ion; avoid every thing that is rude and di&s;orderly, retire home in proper &s;ea&s;on, and take occa&s;ion to ble&s;s God for the re&s;traints of his grace, and &s;en&s;ible of their weakne&s;s and liablene&s;s to temptations, &s;eek for the guidance of his good Spirit in the way of duty, and that they may be kept from falling, and be pre&s;erved by the mighty power of God, through faith unto &s;alvation.
