<HEAD>A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA, NOW MET IN GENERAL CONGRESS AT PHILADELPHIA, SETTING FORTH THE CAUSES AND NECESSITY OF THEIR TAKING UP ARMS.</HEAD>
<P>IF it was po&s;&s;ible for men who exerci&s;e their rea&s;on to believe, that the Divine Author of our exi&s;tence in|tended a part of the human race to hold an ab&s;olute pro|perty in, and an unbounded power over others, marked out by his infinite goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom as the objects of a legal domination, never rightfully re&s;i&s;tible, however &s;evere and oppre&s;&s;ive; the inhabitants of the&s;e Colonies might at lea&s;t require from the Parliament of Great Bri|tain &s;ome evidence, that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to that body. But a reverence for our Great Creator, principles of humanity, and the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t convince all tho&s;e who reflect upon the &s;ubject, that Government was in&s;titut|ed to promote the welfare of mankind, and ought to be admini&s;tered for the attainment of that end. The Legi|&s;lature

of Great Britain, however, &s;timulated by an in|ordinate pa&s;&s;ion for a power not only unju&s;tifiable, but which they know to be peculiarly reprobated by the very con&s;titution of that Kingdom, and de&s;perate of &s;uc|ce&s;s in any mode of conte&s;t, where regard &s;hould be had to truth, law, or right, have at length, de&s;erting tho&s;e, attempted to effect their cruel and impolitic purpo&s;e of en&s;laving the&s;e Colonies by violence, and have thereby rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for us to clo&s;e with their la&s;t ap|peal from rea&s;on to arms.&mdash;Yet, however blinded that A&s;&s;embly may be, by their intemperate rage for unlimit|ed domination, &s;o to &s;light ju&s;tice and the opinion of mankind, we e&s;teem our&s;elves bound by obligations of re&s;pect to the re&s;t of the world, to make known the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Our forefathers, inhabitants of the i&s;land of Great Britain, left their native land, to &s;eek on the&s;e &s;hores a re&s;idence for civil and religious freedom. At the ex|pence of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes, without the lea&s;t charge to the country from which they removed, by uncea&s;ing labour, and an unconquerable &s;pirit, they effected &s;ettlements in the di&s;tant and inho&s;|pitable wilds of America, then filled with numerous and warlike nations of barbarians. Societies or go|vernments, ve&s;ted with perfect legi&s;latures, were formed under Charters from the Crown, and an harmonious in|tercour&s;e was e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Colonies and the Kingdom from which they derived their origin. The mutual benefits of this union became in a &s;hort time &s;o extraordinary, as to excite a&s;toni&s;hment. It is uni|ver&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed, that the amazing increa&s;e of the wealth, &s;trength, and navigation of the realm aro&s;e from this &s;ource; and the Mini&s;ter who &s;o wi&s;ely and &s;ucce&s;sfully directed the mea&s;ures of Great Bri|tain in the late war, publickly declared, that the&s;e Colonies enabled her to triumph over her enemies.&mdash;Towards the conclu&s;ion of that war it plea&s;ed our Sovereign to make a change in his Councils.&mdash;From that fatal moment the affairs of the Briti&s;h Empire be|gan to fall into confu&s;ion, and gradually &s;liding from the &s;ummit of glorious pro&s;perity, to which they had been advanced by the virtues and abilities of one man,

are at length di&s;tracted by the convul&s;ions that now &s;hake it to its deepe&s;t foundation. The new Mini&s;try finding the brave foes of Britain, though frequently defeated, yet &s;till contending, took up the unfortunate idea of granting them a ha&s;ty peace, and of then &s;ubduing her faithful friends.</P>
<P>The&s;e devoted Colonies were judged to be in &s;uch a &s;tate, as to pre&s;ent victories without blood&s;hed, and all the ea&s;y emoluments of &s;tatutable plunder. The un|interrupted tenor of their peaceable and re&s;pectful be|haviour from the beginning of Colonization, their du|tiful, zealous, and u&s;eful &s;ervices during the war, tho' &s;o recently and amply acknowledged in the mo&s;t ho|nourable manner by his Maje&s;ty, by the late King, and by Parliament, could not &s;ave them from the medi|tated innovations. Parliament was influenced to adopt the pernicious project, and a&s;&s;uming a new power over them, have, in the cour&s;e of eleven years, given &s;uch deci&s;ive &s;pecimens of the &s;pirit and con&s;equences attend|ing this power, as to leave no doubt concerning the ef|fects of acquie&s;cence under it. They have undertaken to give and grant our money without our con&s;ent, tho' we have ever exerci&s;ed an exclu&s;ive right to di&s;po&s;e of our own property. Statutes have been pa&s;&s;ed for extend|ing the juri&s;diction of Courts of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty beyond their antient limits, for depriving us of the accu&s;tomed and ine&s;timable privilege of trial by Jury in ca&s;es affecting both life and property; for &s;u&s;|pending the legi&s;lature of one of the Colonies; for in|terdicting all commerce of another; and for altering fundamentally the form of government, e&s;tabli&s;hed by charter, and &s;ecured by Acts of its own Legi&s;lature &s;o|lemnly confirmed by the Crown; for exempting the "Murderers" of Coloni&s;ts from legal trial, and, in effect, from puni&s;hment; for erecting in a neighbour|ing Province, acquired by the joint arms of Great Bri|tain and America, a de&s;poti&s;m dangerous to our very ex|i&s;tence; and for quartering &s;oldiers upon the Coloni&s;ts in time of profound peace. It has al&s;o been re&s;olved in Parliament, that Coloni&s;ts charged with committing certain offences, &s;hall be tran&s;ported to England to be tried.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="014727_0006_0F9488B8C4D82C60">
But why &s;hould we enumerate our injuries in detail? By one Statute it is declared, that Parliament can "of right, make laws to bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever." What is to defend us again&s;t &s;o enormous, &s;o unlimit|ed a power? Not a &s;ingle man of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume it is cho&s;en by us, or is &s;ubject to our controul or in|fluence; but, on the contrary, they are all of them ex|empt from the operation of &s;uch laws; and an American revenue, if not diverted from the o&s;ten&s;ible purpo&s;es for which it is rai&s;ed, would actually lighten their own burdens in proportion as they increa&s;e ours. We &s;aw the mi&s;ery to which &s;uch de&s;poti&s;m would reduce us. We for ten years ince&s;&s;antly and ineffectually be&s;ieged the Throne as &s;upplicants; we rea&s;oned, we remon&s;trated with Parliament in the mo&s;t mild and decent language. But Admini&s;tration, &s;en&s;ible that we &s;hould regard tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures as freemen ought to do, &s;ent over fleets and armies to enforce them. The indignation of the Americans was routed, it is true; but it was the in|dignation of a virtuous, loyal, and affectionate people. A Congre&s;s of Delegates from the United Colonies was a&s;&s;embled at Philadelphia, on the 5th day of la&s;t Septem|ber. We re&s;olved again to offer an humble and duti|ful Petition to the King, and al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed our fel|low-&s;ubjects of Great Britain. We have pur&s;ued every temperate, every re&s;pectful mea&s;ure; we have even pro|ceeded to break off our commercial intercou&s;e with our fellow-&s;ubjects, as the la&s;t peaceable admonition, that our attachment to no nation upon earth &s;hould &s;up|plant our attachment to liberty. This we flattered our|&s;elves was the ultimate &s;tep of the controver&s;y; but the &s;ub&s;equent events have &s;hewn, how vain is this hope of finding moderation in our enemies.</P>
<P>Several threatening expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Colonies were in&s;erted in his Maje&s;ty's Speech. Our Petition, though we were told it was a decent one, that his Ma|je&s;ty had been plea&s;ed to receive it graciou&s;ly, and to promi&s;e laying it before his Parliament, was huddled in|to both Hou&s;es among&s;t a bundle of American papers, and there neglected. The Lords and Commons in their Addre&s;s, in the month of February, &s;aid, That "a re|bellion at that time actually exi&s;ted within the Province
<PB N="9" REF="014727_0007_0F9488B98B899D00">
of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay; and that tho&s;e concerned in it had been countenanced and encouraged by unlawful combi|nations and engagements, entered into by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in &s;everal of the other Colonies; and therefore they be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty, that he would take the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the Supreme Legi&s;lature." Soon after the commercial intercour&s;e of whole Colonies, with fo|reign countries, and with each other, was cut off by an Act of Parliament; by another, &s;everal of them were entirely prohibited from the fi&s;heries in the &s;eas near their coa&s;ts, on which they always depended for their &s;u&s;tenance; and large reinforcements of &s;hips and troops were imme|diately &s;ent over to General Gage.</P>
<P>Fruitle&s;s were all the entreaties, arguments, and elo|quence of an illu&s;trious band of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Peers and Commoners, who nobly and &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, to &s;tay or even to mitigate the heedle&s;s fury with which the&s;e accumulated and unexam|pled outrages were hurried on. Equally fruitle&s;s was the interference of the City of London, of Bri&s;tol, and many other re&s;pectable towns, in our favour. Parliament adopted an in&s;idious manoeuvre, calculated to divide us, to e&s;tabli&s;h a perpetual auction of taxations, where Colony &s;hould bid again&s;t Colony, all of them uninformed what ran&s;om &s;hould redeem their lives, and thus to extort from us, at the point of the bayonet, the unknown &s;ums that &s;hould be &s;ufficient to gratify, if po&s;&s;ible to gratify, Mi|ni&s;terial rapacity, with the mi&s;erable indulgence left to us of rai&s;ing in our own mode the pre&s;cribed tribute. What terms more rigid and humiliating could have been dictated by remor&s;ele&s;s victors to conquered enemies? In our circum&s;tances, to accept them would be to de&s;erve them.</P>
<P>Soon after the intelligence of the&s;e proceedings arrived on this Continent, General Gage, who in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town of Bo&s;ton, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay, and &s;till occupied it as a garri&s;on, on the 19th day of April &s;ent out from that place a large detachment of his army, who made an unprovoked a&s;&s;ault on the inhabitants of the &s;aid province,
<PB N="10" REF="014727_0008_0F9488BA54618F50">
at the town of Lexington, as appears by the affidavits of a great number of per&s;ons, &s;ome of whom were officers and &s;oldiers of that detachment, murdered eight of the inhabitants, and wounded many others. From thence the troops proceeded in warlike array to the town of Concord, where they &s;et upon another party of the in|habitants of the &s;ame Province, killing &s;everal, and wounded more, until compelled to retreat by the coun|try people &s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled to repel this cruel aggre&s;|&s;ion. Ho&s;tilities thus commenced by the Briti&s;h troops, have been &s;ince pro&s;ecuted by them without regard to faith or reputation. The inhabitants of Bo&s;ton being confined within that town by the General their Gover|nor, and having in order to procure their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion en|tered into a treaty with him, it was &s;tipulated that the &s;aid inhabitants, having depo&s;ited their arms with their own Magi&s;trates, &s;hould have liberty to depart, taking with them their other effects. They accordingly deli|vered up their arms; but in open violation of honour, in defiance of the obligation of treaties, which even &s;a|vage nations e&s;teem &s;acred, the Governor ordered the arms depo&s;ited as afore&s;aid, that they might be pre&s;erved for their owners, to be &s;eized by a body of &s;oldiers; de|tained the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants in the town, and compelled the few who were permitted to retire, to leave their mo&s;t valuable effects behind.</P>
<P>By this perfidy wives are &s;eparated from their hu&s;bands, children from their parents, the aged and &s;ick from their relations and friends, who wi&s;h to attend and comfort them; and tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to live in plenty, and even elegance, are reduced to deplorable di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The General, further emulating his Mini&s;terial ma|&s;ters, by a proclamation, bearing date on the 12th day of June, after venting the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fal&s;ehoods and calum|nies again&s;t the good people of the&s;e Colonies, proceeds to "declare them all,. either by name or de&s;cription, to be rebels and traitors; to &s;uper&s;ede the cour&s;e of the common law, and in&s;tead thereof, to publi&s;h and order the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of the law martial."&mdash;His troops have butchered our countrymen; have wantonly burnt Charles-Town, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number of hou&s;es

in other places; our &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els are &s;eized; the ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of provi&s;ions are intercepted, and he is ex|erting his utmo&s;t power to &s;pread de&s;truction and deva&s;ta|tion around him.</P>
<P>We have received certain intelligence, that General Carleton, the Governor of Canada, is in&s;tigating the people of that Province and the Indians to fall upon us; and we have but too much rea&s;on to apprehend, that &s;chemes have been formed to excite dome&s;tic enemies again&s;t us. In brief, a part of the&s;e Colonies now feels, and all of them are &s;ure of feeling, as far as the vengeance of Admini&s;tration can inflict them, the complicated cala|mities of fire, &s;word and famine. We are reduced to the alternative of chu&s;ing an unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the tyranny of irritated Mini&s;ters, or re&s;i&s;tance by force. The latter is our choice. We have counted the co&s;t of this conte&s;t, and find nothing &s;o dreadful as voluntary &s;lavery. Honour, ju&s;tice and humanity, forbid us tamely to &s;urrender that freedom which we received from our gallant ance&s;tors, and which our innocent po&s;terity have a right to receive from us. We cannot endure the infa|my and guilt of re&s;igning &s;ucceeding generations to that wretchedne&s;s which inevitably awaits them, if we ba&s;ely entail hereditary bondage upon them.</P>
<P>Our cau&s;e is ju&s;t: our union is perfect: our internal re&s;ources are great; and if nece&s;&s;ary, foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance is undoubtedly attainable. We gratefully acknowledge, as &s;ignal in&s;tances of Divine favour towards us, that his Pro|vidence would not permit us to be called into this &s;evere controver&s;y, until we were grown up to our pre&s;ent &s;trength, had been previou&s;ly exerci&s;ed in warlike opera|tions, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the means of defending our&s;elves. With hearts fortified with the&s;e animating reflections, we mo&s;t &s;olemnly before God and the world declare, that, exerting the utmo&s;t energy of tho&s;e powers which our beneficent Creator hath graciou&s;ly be&s;towed upon us, the arms we have been compelled by our enemies to a&s;|&s;ume, we will, in defiance of every hazard, with un|abating firmne&s;s and per&s;everance, employ for the pre|&s;ervation of our liberties, being with one mind re&s;olved to die freemen rather than to live &s;laves.</P>

Le&s;t this Declaration &s;hould di&s;quiet the minds of our friends and fellow-&s;ubjects in any part of the empire, we a&s;&s;ure them, that we mean not to di&s;&s;olve that union which has &s;o long and &s;o happily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, and which we &s;incerely wi&s;h to &s;ee re&s;tored. Nece&s;&s;ity has not yet driven us into that de&s;perate mea&s;ure, or in|duced us to excite any other nation to war again&s;t them. We have not rai&s;ed armies with ambitious de&s;igns of &s;eparating from Great Britain, and e&s;tabli&s;hing indepen|dant &s;tates. We fight not for glory or for conque&s;t. We exhibit to mankind the remarkable &s;pectacle of a people attacked by unprovoked enemies, without any imputation, or even &s;u&s;picion of offence. They boa&s;t of their privileges and civilization, and yet proffer no milder conditions than &s;ervitude or death.</P>
<P>In our own native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birthright, and which we ever enjoyed till the late violation of it; for the protection of our pro|perty, acquired &s;olely by the hone&s;t indu&s;try of our fore|fathers and our&s;elves, again&s;t violence actually offered, we have taken up arms. We &s;hall lay them down when ho&s;tilities &s;hall cea&s;e on the part of the aggre&s;&s;ors, and all danger of their being renewed &s;hall be removed,&mdash;and not before.</P>
<P>With an humble confidence in the mercies of the Su|preme and Impartial Judge and Ruler of the Univer&s;e, we mo&s;t devoutly implore his Divine Goodne&s;s to conduct us happily through this great conflict, to di&s;po&s;e our adver|&s;aries to reconciliation on rea&s;onable terms, and thereby to relieve the Empire from the calamities of civil war.</P>

<HEAD>AN ANSWER TO THE DECLARATION OF THE GENERAL CONGRESS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Independent States take up arms, they endeavour to impre&s;s the World with a favourable opinion of their own cau&s;e, and to lay the blame of ho&s;tilities on the inju&s;tice of their Opponents. But if Nations, ac|countable to none for their conduct, deem it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to reconcile others to their proceedings, the nece&s;&s;ity is &s;till more urgent with regard to tho&s;e who, breaking through every political duty, draw their &s;words again&s;t the State of which they own them&s;elves the &s;ubjects. The opinions of man|kind are invariably oppo&s;ed to &s;uch men. Their a&s;&s;ertions are heard with di&s;tru&s;t, their arguments weighed with caution; and, therefore, it is as ne|ce&s;&s;ary for them to adhere to truth, in the former, as it is prudent to avoid &s;ophi&s;try in the latter.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration, however obvious it may ap|pear to others, &s;eems to have totally e&s;caped the
<PB N="14" REF="014727_0012_0F9488C4893F7A38">
attention of the body of men who lately &s;at at Philadelphia under the name of "The General American Congre&s;s." In a paper publi&s;hed un|der the title of <Q>A DECLARATION by the Re|pre&s;entatives of the United Colonies of North America</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide from page 5. to 13.</NOTE> the facts are either wilfully or igno|rantly mi&s;repre&s;ented; and the arguments deduced from premi&s;es that have no foundation in truth. But, as whatever falls from men who call them|&s;elves the Repre&s;entatives of a People, mu&s;t fall with &s;ome degree of weight on the minds of the undi&s;cerning part of mankind, it becomes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, nece&s;&s;ary to examine briefly the rea&s;ons held forth by the Congre&s;s to ju&s;tify the rebellion of their Con&s;tituents. On a &s;ubject &s;o trite, ar|guments advanced by other writers may &s;ometimes recur; but novelty is le&s;s the object of this part of the di&s;qui&s;ition, than per&s;picuity and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The declaration of the Congre&s;s begins with an involved period, which either contains no meaning, or a meaning not founded on the prin|ciples of rea&s;on. They &s;eem to in&s;inuate, that no body of men, in any Empire, can exerci&s;e an "unbounded authority over others;" an opinion contrary to fact under every form of Government. No maxim in policy is more univer&s;ally admitted, than that a &s;upreme and uncontroulable power mu&s;t exi&s;t &s;omewhere in every &s;tate. This ultimate power, though ju&s;tly dreaded and reprobated in the per&s;on of ONE MAN, is the fir&s;t &s;pring in every Political Society. The great difference, between
<PB N="15" REF="014727_0013_0F9488C65DC5E320">
the degrees of freedom in various Governments, con&s;i&s;ts merely in the manner of placing this ne|ce&s;&s;ary di&s;cretionary power. In the Briti&s;h Em|pire it is ve&s;ted, where it is mo&s;t &s;afe, in King, Lords, and Commons, under the collective ap|pellation of the Legi&s;lature. The Legi&s;lature is another name for the con&s;titution of the &s;tate; and, in fact, the &s;tate it&s;elf. The Americans &s;till own them&s;elves the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate; but if they refu&s;e obedience to the laws of the Legi&s;|lature, they play upon words, and are no longer &s;ubjects, but rebels. In vain have they affirmed that they are the &s;ubjects of the King's prero|gative, and not his &s;ubjects in his legi&s;lative qua|lity; as the King, with regard to his &s;ubjects in general, is to be con&s;idered only in his executive capacity as the great hereditary Magi&s;trate, who carries into effect the laws of the Legi&s;lature, the only di&s;cretionary and uncontroulable power in a free &s;tate.</P>
<P>The di&s;cretionary and uncontroulable authority of the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature being granted, their right to tax all the &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h Empire can never be denied. Some ill-informed rea&s;oners in politics have lately &s;tarted an ob&s;olete maxim, which has been &s;eized with avidity by the Ame|ricans, That <Q>the Supreme Power cannot take from any one any part of his property without his con&s;ent;</Q> or in other words, That Repre&s;en|tation is in&s;eparable from Taxation. The Colo|ni&s;ts, &s;ay they, have no Repre&s;entatives in Parlia|ment, and therefore Parliament has no right to tax the Coloni&s;ts. Upon this principle &s;carce one in twenty-five of the people of Great-Britain is re|pre&s;ented.
<PB N="16" REF="014727_0014_0F9488C6F53B6930">
Out of more than &s;even millions, fewer than three hundred thou&s;and have an exclu&s;ive right to chu&s;e Members of Parliament; and, there|fore, more than three times the number of the Americans have an equal right with them to di&s;|pute the authority of the Legi&s;lature to &s;ubject them to taxes. The truth is, Repre&s;entation never accompanied Taxation in any State. The Romans were a free nation; yet the Senate, that is, the great body of the nobility, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ole right of taxing the people. In this kingdom, the Hou&s;e of commons have an exclu&s;ive right of modifying and regulating the quantity of public &s;upplies, and the manner of laying taxes: but the Commons, by their own authority, cannot en|force the rai&s;ing the &s;upplies they vote. That pri|vilege is inherent in the &s;upreme and unac|countable power ve&s;ted in the three branches of the Legi&s;lature united; who are in fact the State, as the virtual Repre&s;entatives of the whole Em|pire, and not the delegates of individuals.</P>
<P>Why it has been &s;o generally received as a maxim, in this country, That Taxation and Re|pre&s;entation are in&s;eparable, requires to be ex|plained. Men, little acquainted with the Con&s;ti|tution, derived the opinion from their finding, that it is the indi&s;putable right of the Com|mons, that all grants of &s;ub&s;idies and parlia|mentary aids &s;hould originate in their Hou&s;e. But though they fir&s;t be&s;tow tho&s;e &s;ub&s;idies and aids, their grants, as has been already ob&s;erved, have no effect without the a&s;&s;ent of the other two branches of the Legi&s;lature. The common rea&s;on given for this exclu&s;ive privilege is, That as the
<PB N="17" REF="014727_0015_0F9488C7B5D2F9F8">
&s;upplies are rai&s;ed upon the body of the people, the people only ought to have the right of taxing them&s;elves. This argument would have been con|clu&s;ive, if the Commons taxed none but tho&s;e by who&s;e &s;uffrages they obtained their &s;eats in Parlia|ment. But it has appeared, that more than &s;even millions of people, be&s;ides the Peers, who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o large a &s;hare of property in the kingdom, have no voice in the election of the members who fit in the lower hou&s;e. The Com|mons, therefore, and their con&s;tituents not be|ing the <HI>only</HI> per&s;ons taxed, the former cannot po&s;|&s;ibly have the <HI>only</HI> right of rai&s;ing and modelling the &s;upply, from the mere circum&s;tance of repre|&s;entation. But if they have it not from repre|&s;entation, they mu&s;t in fact derive it from the &s;u|preme and di&s;cretionary power, which is repo&s;ed in them, in conjunction with the two other bran|ches of the Legi&s;lature. It appears, upon the whole, that Taxation is the re&s;ult of that di&s;|cretionary authority placed in the hands of the Legi&s;lature, and exerted by them for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of the &s;tate. To this authority the whole Empire mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and con&s;equently no one of its &s;ubjects can claim any exemption.</P>
<P>The Counties Palatine of Che&s;ter, Durham, and Lanca&s;ter, were anciently in the &s;ame predicament with the Americans, on the article of Taxa|tion. The Earl of Che&s;ter and the Bi&s;hop of Durham became, by pre&s;cription and im|memorial cu&s;tom, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a kind of regal juri&s;diction, within their re&s;pective territories. A &s;imilar form of Government was e&s;tabli&s;hed by King Edward III. in the County of Lanca&s;ter;
<PB N="18" REF="014727_0016_0F9488C8731E1AF8">
which was erected fir&s;t into an Earldom, and then into a Dukedom, in the per&s;on of Henry Planta|genet; who&s;e heire&s;s carried the &s;ame rights and privileges to John of Gaunt, that King's fourth &s;on, and his po&s;terity. But though the SUBORDI|NATE SOVEREIGNS of the&s;e Counties could pardon trea&s;ons, murders and felonies; though they ap|pointed all Judges, nominated all Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and, in &s;hort, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed exclu&s;ively the whole internal Government of their &s;everal Coun|ties; their SUBJECTS (if the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed) were <Q>always bound by the Acts and Sta|tutes</Q><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Statutes at Large, 34 and 35 of Henry VIII. c. 13.</NOTE> of an A&s;&s;embly, in which they had no Repre&s;entatives. They were al&s;o "liable to all payments, rates, and &s;ub&s;idies, granted by the Parliament of England<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 25 of Charles II. c. 9.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Counties (it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed), like the Americans, con&s;idered their being excluded from having Repre&s;entatives in an A&s;&s;embly by which they were taxed, a grievance. Accordingly, the Town and County of Che&s;ter, as far back as the thirty-fifth of Henry VIII. petitioned the Legi&s;la|ture for the privilege of &s;ending Members to Par|liament; and their reque&s;t was granted by an ex|pre&s;s Statute<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">34 and 35 of Henry VIII. c. 13.</NOTE>. The county and City of Durham made a &s;imilar application, and with the &s;ame &s;uc|ce&s;s, in the twenty-fifth of Charles II.<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">25 of Charles II. c. 9.</NOTE> Had the Americans, in&s;tead of flying to arms, &s;ubmitted
<PB N="19" REF="014727_0017_0F9488C935B5CD38">
the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ed grievance, in a peaceable and dutiful manner, to the Legi&s;lature, I can perceive no rea&s;on why their reque&s;t &s;hould be refu&s;ed. Had they, like the County and City of Che&s;ter, repre&s;ented, that "for lack of Knights and Bur|ge&s;&s;es to repre&s;ent them in the High Court of Parliament, they had been oftentimes TOUCHED and GRIEVED with acts and &s;tatutes made with|in the &s;aid Court, derogatory to their mo&s;t an|cient juri&s;dictions, liberties and privileges, and pre|judicial to their quietne&s;s, re&s;t and peace;" this Country would, I am per&s;uaded, have no objection to their being repre&s;ented in her Parliament.</P>
<P>But the Colonies, though that circum&s;tance is only in&s;inuated in the Declaration, have uniformly affirmed, that granting the &s;upremacy of Parlia|ment &s;hould extend over the whole Empire, yet that they them&s;elves have a right to an exemption from Taxes either by the conce&s;&s;ions of the Legi&s;|lature, or by charters from the King. It &s;eems incompatible with rea&s;on, &s;ay they, that the Co|lonies &s;hould have internal Legi&s;latures of their own, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the authority of taxation, and that, notwith&s;tanding, the Briti&s;h Parliament &s;hould re|tain its power of laying impo&s;ts. The fir&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions is not founded in truth. The Charters give no exemption from Taxation; on the contrary, &s;ome of them expre&s;&s;ly &s;ubject the Colonies to the &s;upreme legi&s;lature of Great-Bri|tain; and had the Charters mentioned an exempti|on, the legi&s;lature, by virtue of its &s;upreme, uni|ver&s;al, and di&s;cretionary power, can recal any rights they have conferred, when the good of the State
<PB N="20" REF="014727_0018_0F9488CA0C427168">
renders that mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary. Though the King may give away by Charter a right that militates again&s;t him&s;elf, as hereditary chief magi&s;trate, he cannot authorize, by any deed whatever, an ex|emption from the general laws of the &s;tate. In &s;uch a ca&s;e one of the three branches of the Legi&s;lature would u&s;urp the power of the THE THREE unit|ed; a &s;oleci&s;m as great in polity, as it is in mathe|matics to affirm, that a part is greater than the whole.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary, perhaps, to make an apo|logy for entering &s;o minutely into the argument in favour of the right of Taxation. The Americans them&s;elves have de&s;erted that ground. They &s;peak no longer as &s;ubjects. They a&s;&s;ume the language of rivals, and they act as enemies. The que&s;tion between them and Great-Britain (for it is no longer between them and Government) con&s;i&s;ts of dependence or independence, connection or no connection, except on the footing of a Sovereign State. They have already arrogated to them&s;eves all the functions of Sovereignty. They have formed a great deliberative Council. They have taken the whole executive power into their own hands. They have &s;truck a new currency, rai&s;ed armies, appointed generals; and that they have not cho&s;en ANOTHER SOVEREIGN, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed more to their Republican principles, than to any remains of loyalty for their lawful Prince.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of affairs and opinions, it is mat|ter of little &s;urprize, that men who deny the au|thority of the State &s;hould load the Legi&s;lature with opprobrious epithets. The Congre&s;s accord|ingly

<P>The Congre&s;s, in the next paragraph of their Declaration, affect to reprobate the la&s;t Peace, though they have derived &s;o many and &s;o great advantages from that treaty. The conduct of the Americans ought al&s;o to induce this King|dom to regret the &s;tipulations &s;he made for their &s;ecurity. Had Canada remained in the hands of the French, the Colonies would have remained dutiful &s;ubjects. Their fears for them&s;elves, in that ca&s;e, would have &s;upplied the place of their pretended affection for this Nation. They would have &s;poken more &s;par|ingly of their own re&s;ources, as they might daily &s;tand in need of our aid. Their former incapacity of defending them&s;elves would have always recurred to their minds, as long as the objects of their former terror &s;hould continue &s;o near their borders. But their habitual fears from France were, it &s;eems, removed only to give room to their ingratitude to Great Britain.</P>
<P>The effrontery with which the Congre&s;s reprobate the late Peace, is &s;carcely equal to their folly in applauding the Mini&s;ter who had carried on the war. With peculiar incon&s;i&s;tency they effect to commence an aera of "Public Ruin," from Mr. Pitt's re&s;ignation in 1761; yet the whole "object of their wi&s;hes" is to be placed on the &s;ame footing as in the year 1763.

They do not recollect, or rather they pretend to forget, that the mo&s;t &s;plendid actions in the war, happened after Mr. Pitt retired from his office. They are ignorant, or de&s;ignedly con|ceal, that the commerce of this kingdom has amazingly encrea&s;ed, and, in con&s;equence, its revenue, &s;ince the aera from which they date pub|lic ruin. They know, or they ought, from their own experience, to know, that notwith&s;tand|ing their &s;hutting their ports again&s;t our manu|factures, permanent and profitable &s;ources of commerce have been opened in other quarters; that in&s;tead of being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by their pre&s;ent interruption to trade, our Merchants find them|&s;elves incapable of fulfilling their commi&s;&s;ions from foreign &s;tates; that as the &s;ure&s;t te&s;t of the flouri&s;hing condition of commerce, the cour&s;e of exchange, to the amount of &s;everal per cents. is univer&s;ally in favour of Great-Britain; and that, as the ultimate and invincible proof of the public pro&s;perity, the confidence of the people in the mea&s;ures of Government, and their con|tempt for the rebellious efforts of the refractory Colonies, the national Stocks &s;uffer neither fluctuation nor fall in the price.</P>

of rhetoric, if it has any meaning, conveys one contrary to the truth. The Coloni&s;ts hav|ing obtained &s;uch amazing advantages by a Peace, which they now reprobate, it was deemed ju&s;t and proper by Mr. Grenville, then at the head of the Trea&s;ury, that they &s;hould bear a proportionable &s;hare of the nati|onal burdens incurred by the war. But as their prior inability to bear internal Taxes had pre|cluded him from having a precedent, he only <HI>threw out,</HI> as it is vulgarly expre&s;&s;ed, in the beginning of the year 1764, his intentions of rai&s;ing a revenue in America by a Stamp-Duty, &s;imilar to that e&s;tabli&s;hed in Great-Britain; referring the con&s;ideration of the whole affair to the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. His object was, to give time to the Colonies to propo&s;e &s;ome other mode of Taxation, &s;hould that &s;ugge&s;ted to Parliament appear either improper or burden|&s;ome. During the whole of the &s;ummer 1764, though &s;ome di&s;contented &s;pirits murmured, not a &s;ingle doubt was &s;tarted again&s;t the ABSOLUTE RIGHT of Parliament to impo&s;e Taxes on every Member of the Briti&s;h Empire. The time allowed to the Colonies furni&s;hed them with no expedient for rai&s;ing a tax more &s;uitable to the purpo&s;e of a Revenue (which, by the bye, was to have been &s;pent among them&s;elves); and, therefore, in the beginning of the year 1765, the famous Stamp-Act was pa&s;&s;ed, again&s;t a very incon&s;iderable Minority, in both Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>

In this Kingdom, as well as in every State po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of freedom, there are always to be found factious per&s;ons, who oppo&s;e every mea|&s;ure of Government.

Every &s;ide of a &s;peculative point is armed with arguments, that may im|po&s;e on the ignorant, and encourage the &s;an|guine. The oppo&s;ition in Parliament, in &s;hort, committed them&s;elves too far in favour of the prejudices of the Americans, with regard to the Stamp-Act, to &s;upport it with vigour, when they them&s;elves, very unexpectedly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Rockingam and others in Oppo&s;ition came into Office July 10, 1765, Grenville and his party having thrown them&s;elves out of place on the Regency Bill.</NOTE>, came into Office, a few months after it had pa&s;&s;ed into Law. Though their view of the object changed with their elevation, they found that the flame which their own factious &s;peeches, in the preceding Se&s;&s;ion, had rai&s;ed in America, was too vehement to be extin|gui&s;hed without conce&s;&s;ions. A natural timi|dity of di&s;po&s;ition, joined to the common want of firmne&s;s which accompanies novelty in office, rendered them inclinable to purcha&s;e pre&s;ent quiet for them&s;elves, at the expence of the future advantage of their country. But &s;till they wavered on the point of irre&s;olution, till
<PB N="29" REF="014727_0027_0F9488D2F239F8A0">
Mr. Pitt's oratory weighed down the &s;cale. The Stamp-Act was repealed; and from that moment may be dated "the commencement of" what the Americans call <Q>an Aera of Public Ruin.</Q></P>
<P>To enter into the motives of Mr. Pitt's oratory, for the total and ab&s;olute repeal of the Stamp-Act, would be to de&s;ert a great and public &s;ubject for the &s;ake of tracing the private views of an ambitious man. In his Argument, if what he advanced de&s;erves the name, he fell in with the vulgar and, it may be &s;aid, fal&s;e maxim, That no profit ought to be expected from the Colonies, but That re&s;ulting from their Commerce. This opinion of Mr. Pitt, whether it proceeded from ignorance or de&s;ign (and it probably proceeded from both,) has formed a popular error in former times, as well as in the pre&s;ent age. Many, who have pretended to under&s;tand perfectly the affairs of this Kingdom, mo&s;t firmly, but in my opinion very weakly, believed that the great &s;ecret of our political intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in forcing, in a manner, a monopoly of foreign commerce. It was from this per&s;ua&s;ion, that the popular Orator u&s;ed, upon the occa&s;ion ju&s;t mentioned, a figure of rhetoric at once fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd, when he affirmed, that the Coloni&s;ts &s;hould be prohibited "from manufacturing even the hob-nail of a hor&s;e-&s;hoe!" One might be tempted to a&s;k the Orator, how this prohibi|tory mandate could be enforced; or if it could,
<PB N="30" REF="014727_0028_0F9488D4B1EFE7B0">
whether it is le&s;s arbitrary, than to demand an <HI>internal</HI> tax from the Americans, for the &s;up|port of their own government, and even for the general &s;upport of the State, and as a &s;uit|able return for the protection which they have ever derived from the Government of this kingdom?</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s had &s;urely forgot this &s;trange rhetorical figure of the great Orator, when they were tempted to date PUBLIC RUIN, from his re&s;ignation in 1761. They have al&s;o for|got, or they do not chu&s;e to remember, that he acquie&s;ced in the DECLARATORY BILL, brought in and pa&s;&s;ed by the Marqui&s;s of Rockingham's Party, who were in office, in the beginning of the year 1766. This Bill ex|pre&s;&s;ly declares, <Q>that all his Maje&s;ty's Colo|nies and Plantations in America have been, are and of right ought to be, &s;ubordinate to and dependent upon the Imperial Crown and PARLIAMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN; who have full power and authority to make laws and &s;tatutes of &s;ufficient validity to bind the Colonies and People of Ame|rica, &s;ubjects of the Crown of Great-Britain, IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pitt, to pre&s;erve &s;ome degree of con&s;i&s;t|ency, objected to the words "IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER." But his oppo&s;ition was &s;o languid, that he did not attend the Hou&s;e when the bill was pa&s;&s;ed; and only five Peers were found to follow his opinion, when it came under debate in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>

"The Declaratory Act," as the American Congre&s;s affirms, <Q>comprehends all the griev|ances of which they complain.</Q> Yet that very Congre&s;s, with peculiar effrontery, not only approve, but even prai&s;e the conduct of the very party by whom the Bill was intro|duced, and the MAN, by who&s;e CRIMINAL ACQUIESCENCE (to u&s;e one of his own phra&s;es) it pa&s;&s;ed into a law. THAT Party and THAT MAN, being now in oppo&s;ition to Government, the Americans endeavour to &s;ecure their &s;upport, by flattering their vanity at the expence of truth!

and 1768, though the Americans date their mis|fortunes from the re&s;ignation of Mr. Pitt in October 1761, that the Bills impo&s;ing internal Duties, and con&s;equently e&s;tabli&s;hing internal Taxation in America, were pa&s;&s;ed into laws?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">7 Geo.

<P>In reprobating the Declaratory Act, the Congre&s;s recur to their u&s;ual maxim, That Taxation and Repre&s;entation are in&s;eparable. Though it has been already &s;hewn, that they are as much repre&s;ented as twenty-four in twenty-five of the inhabitants of Great-Britain; though it has been proved, that whole Pro|vinces, not repre&s;ented, had been for &s;everal ages &s;ubjected to impo&s;ts laid by the Legi&s;la|ture; though it &s;hall, hereafter, appear that they them&s;elves have been uniformly taxed by the Briti&s;h Parliament; this argument they

hold forth as invincible, and found upon it their pre&s;ent re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;upremacy of the Parent-kingdom. In pur&s;uing it injudiciou&s;ly and too far, they actually di&s;cover the expe|diency, and even nece&s;&s;ity of that &s;upremacy, of which they &s;o loudly complain. The Par|liament of Great-Britain, &s;ay they, will cer|tainly perceive, <Q>That an American revenue, if not diverted from the o&s;ten&s;ible purpo&s;es for which it is rai&s;ed, will actually lighten their own burdens, in proportion as they in|crea&s;e ours.</Q> But is it not equitable, is it not ju&s;t, is it not nece&s;&s;ary, that all the &s;ubjects of the empire &s;hould bear, as equally as po&s;&s;i|ble, the public burdens of the empire? Why &s;hould the Americans, who have &s;o largely, &s;o uniformly, and &s;o effectually experienced the protection of Government, be the only per&s;ons exempted from paying their &s;hare of its ex|pences? Is it either rea&s;onable or &s;uitable to the common u&s;age of Nations, that tho&s;e who de&s;ert their country &s;hould enjoy greater privi|leges than tho&s;e that remain? The Americans having been &s;pared during the infancy of their Colonies on account of their poverty, endea|vour to e&s;tabli&s;h into an inherent right what was actually an indulgence.</P>
<P>Though this indulgence has been a &s;ource of error to the more ignorant part of the Ameri|cans, there are &s;urely many among them, who
<PB N="34" REF="014727_0032_0F9488D842897D88">
know, that Parliament hath been uniformly accu&s;tomed to extend its &s;upremacy over all the Colonies. In matters of revenue, in commerce, in civil, in all judicial regulations; and, in &s;hort, with regard to the general con&s;titution of their government, the Provinces of North-America, till taught otherwi&s;e by a di&s;appoint|ed faction in this Kingdom, allowed, that the whole fabrick of their polity might be new modelled and reformed by the &s;uperintending power of Parliament. In fact, it has been &s;o new modelled and reformed, whenever abu&s;es in the Admini&s;tration of their government, under their civil polity, or the general inte|re&s;t of the Briti&s;h Empire, made it nece&s;&s;ary for Parliament to interpo&s;e its authority. In&s;tances of this interpo&s;ition, in both ca&s;es, pre&s;ent them&s;elves, in almo&s;t every volume of the Statutes, from the Re&s;toration down to the pre&s;ent reign; yet the Americans fal&s;ely in&s;inu|ate, that it was in the pre&s;ent reign the exerci&s;e of the authority of Parliament (except only in the regulation of trade) fir&s;t commenced.</P>
<P>A brief recital of &s;ome of tho&s;e in&s;tances may throw light on a &s;ubject, rendered ob&s;cure and perplexed by the prejudices of the ignorant, and the arts of de&s;igning men. To gain the ears of the Populace, by awakening their ancient jealou|&s;ies, the Americans affect to a&s;cribe the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures to principles of Toryi&s;m,

which, they pretend, prevail in our Councils. But, unfortunately for this part of their plan of deception, it will appear, that mo&s;t of the Acts which bind America in coercive regulations, were pa&s;&s;ed &s;oon after the Revolution; in the reign of the very Prince, who brought about that great event. The WHIG Mini&s;ters of King William (perceiving that the Colonies, even then, had entertained views of placing them&s;elves on a ground of independence on Parliament) advi&s;ed their Sovereign, and their advice now &s;tands on record, to pur&s;ue mea|&s;ures, which, in their con&s;equence, &s;hould ef|fectually &s;ecure their thorough dependence on the Legi&s;lature of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the advice given by a WHIG Mini&s;try to a King who had mounted the throne upon WHIG principles; and al&s;o upon the fulle&s;t evidence of the frauds and abu&s;es committed in the Plantations, in viola|tion of the Act of Navigation; the Act of the 7th and 8th of William III. <Q>for preventing frauds, and regulating abu&s;es, in the Planta|tions</Q> was pa&s;&s;ed. By that Act, a power was given to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury and Cu&s;toms in England, <Q>to e&s;tabli&s;h ports, and appoint Officers, in the Plantations; and tho&s;e Officers to have the &s;ame authority for vi&s;iting &s;hips and goods, and entering
<PB N="36" REF="014727_0034_0F9488DB440F71A8">
hou&s;es and warehou&s;es, as was exerci&s;ed by the &s;ame Officers in England.</Q></P>
<P>All penalties and forfeitures were made re|coverable in the Courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter, or in Courts of Admiralty, in the Plantations; which Courts were then, for the <HI>fir&s;t time,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout all America. In any action or &s;uit concerning his Maje&s;ty's Duties, the offence might be laid in any precinct or divi&s;ion of the Plantations, where the &s;ame &s;hould be alledged to have been committed, at the di&s;cretion of the Officer or Informer. All laws, by-laws, u&s;ages and cu&s;toms repugnant to any laws of Great Britain which relate to the Plantations, or mention the &s;ame, are declared "illegal, null, and void." Many other re&s;trictions, too tedious to be mentioned, were at the &s;ame time enacted and impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But it was not in matters of Trade ONLY, that Parliament, during the reign of King William, &s;uperintended and controuled the Colonies. The Coloni&s;ts, it was found, had encouraged Pirates, in various places; and no ju&s;tice could be obtained in THEIR Courts again&s;t offenders, whom they openly abetted. To remedy this &s;hameful abu&s;e, a remarkable Act was pa&s;&s;ed, in the 11th and 12th of William III. This Act aboli&s;hed all Juri&s;|diction in that ca&s;e, in the Courts in the Plan|tations. The SOLE power of trying &s;uch of|fences, in the Colonies, was ve&s;ted in Com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
<PB N="37" REF="014727_0035_0F9488DC20AFAD00">
appointed under the Great Seal of England, or Seal of the Admiralty, according to the cour&s;e of the Admiralty, that is to &s;ay, WITHOUT JURY. The Commi&s;&s;ioners were al&s;o impowered to i&s;&s;ue warrants, in any of the Colonies, for arre&s;ting &s;uch Pirates or their acce&s;&s;aries. They might, at di&s;cretion, either try the criminals in America, or &s;end them to England to be tried. Should the Governors of any Charter or Proprietary Go|vernment refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners; &s;hould any per&s;on in authority, in the Colonies, refu&s;e to pay obedience to the Act; &s;uch refu&s;al, in either ca&s;e, was declared to be a forfeiture of the Charter.</P>
<P>An Act pa&s;&s;ed in the 10th and 11th year of the &s;ame reign, confines the advantage of the Fi&s;hery of Newfoundland to Briti&s;h &s;hips fitted out from Great-Britain. The execution of the orders and regulations re&s;pecting that Fi&s;hery, was placed in the hands of the Admirals, in the re&s;pective harbours; that is to &s;ay, in the hands of the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip that &s;hould fir&s;t arrive from Great-Britain. The deci&s;ion in all que&s;tions of civil &s;uit is ve&s;ted in &s;uch Admirals, with appeal to the Commander of the King's &s;hips. All criminal offences are to be tried, in any County of England, by the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners of Oyer and Terminer and Goal delivery.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="014727_0036_0F9488DCB25475E0">
The opinions of this Nation concerning the Government of the Colonies, may be collected from the above acts. The authority of Parlia|ment to bind America, in all ca&s;es what&s;o|ever, and whenever the general intere&s;t of the whole Empire required it, was never di&s;puted; and it was often exerted to correct abu&s;es, and to &s;uppre&s;s the ideas of independence, which began, even then, to be cheri&s;hed by the Co|lonies. The &s;ame principles, and the &s;ame policy, were carried down by Parliament through the three &s;ucceeding reigns of Queen Anne, and of George I. and George II.</P>
<P>Early in the fir&s;t of tho&s;e reigns, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;es were committed by the petty Legi&s;la|tures in the Colonies, with re&s;pect to Coin. The interpo&s;ition of Parliament became ne|ce&s;&s;ary to correct tho&s;e abu&s;es. An Act was pa&s;&s;ed in the 6th of Queen Ann, for that pur|po&s;e; when the Councils of that Prince&s;s were guided by Whigs. By this Act the rates of Foreign Coin, in the Plantations, were a&s;cer|tained; and a &s;evere puni&s;hment was inflicted on tho&s;e who &s;hould take them at higher rates. The American trade was placed in the &s;ame reign under further re&s;trictions, by Act of Par|liament. Rice and Mola&s;&s;es were added to the li&s;t of enumerated commodities. In the reign of George I. Furrs and Copper-ore of the Plantations were &s;ubjected to the &s;ame re|&s;trictions.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="014727_0037_0F9488DF0D8DE110">
The Briti&s;h Parliament confined not to Acts, their &s;en&s;e of the undoubted right they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of controuling the Colonies, in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever. In the Journals of both Hou&s;es, there are many Proceedings which furni&s;h proofs of their undeviating adherence to the &s;ame prin|ciples. In the year 1702, a Bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, for aboli&s;hing all the Charter and Proprietary Governments in America, and re-uniting them to the Crown. In 1705, the Hou&s;e of Lords came to &s;everal Re&s;olutions on the &s;ubject of laws enacted in &s;everal of tho&s;e Governments. They declared tho&s;e laws to be repugnant to the laws of England, and de&s;tructive to the Con&s;titution. This proceeding was likewi&s;e followed by a Bill for aboli&s;hing tho&s;e Char|ters.</P>
<P>The&s;e Bills, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, were not carried into laws. But they did not fail, through any doubt entertained by the Legi&s;lature again&s;t their propriety. They were lo&s;t through a change in the &s;ituation of tho&s;e, who brought forward the mea&s;ure. That the opinion of the Legi&s;lature continued the &s;ame on this &s;ubject, is evident; as the &s;ame propo&s;ition was again taken up in the year 1716; when a WHIG Mini&s;try governed the Kingdom.</P>
<P>In the reign of George II. the in&s;tances of the controuling authority of Parliament over the
<PB N="40" REF="014727_0038_0F9488E1099C8A70">
Colonies, are more numerous and &s;triking: By an Act of the 2d of George II. Chap. 35. &s;evere prohibitions and penalties are impo&s;ed and inflicted on &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hall cut and de&s;troy white Pines, although &s;uch Pines are growing within the limits of a Town&s;hip al|ready granted; and the&s;e penalties are directed to be &s;ued for and recovered in the Courts of Ad|miralty. The Merchants of Great-Britain having, in the 5th of the &s;ame reign, preferred a Petition to Parliament, complaining of the difficulties they met with in the recovery of debts in the Plantations; an Act was pa&s;&s;ed, which &s;ubjected all real E&s;tates in the Colonies to ju&s;t debts and demands; and to be a&s;&s;ets, in the &s;ame manner as in England, for the &s;atisfaction of debts due by Bond. The exportation of Hats from any of the Colonies, and even the conveyance of them by land from one Colony to another, is prohibited, under &s;evere penalties, by an Act pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the year 1733 the Province of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ett's-Bay pre&s;ented a Petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, praying that they might be heard by Coun&s;el on the &s;ubject of Grievances. The chief of the&s;e was, <Q>That the Crown had re&s;trained their Governor, by in&s;tructions, in certain ca&s;es relative to the i&s;&s;ue and di&s;|po&s;al of Public Money, and the emi&s;&s;ion of Paper-Bills of Credit.</Q> The Commons,
<PB N="41" REF="014727_0039_0F9488E22ED75928">
having con&s;idered the matter, came to a Re&s;olution, <Q>That the Petition was frivo|lous and groundle&s;s, a high in&s;ult upon his Maje&s;ty's Government, and tending to SHAKE OFF THE DEPENDENCY of the &s;aid Colony upon this Kingdom, to which in LAW and RIGHT THEY OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT.</Q> Complaint having, at the &s;ame time, been made to the Hou&s;e, <Q>That the Repre&s;entatives of that Colony had CENSURED a per&s;on for giving evi|dence, before a Committee of the Hou&s;e, in the ca&s;e of a Bill then depending in Parliament;</Q> it was re&s;olved, <Q>That the pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch cen&s;ure was an AUDACIOUS PROCEEDING, and a high violation of the privileges of the Hou&s;e.</Q> A Committee was accordingly appointed to enquire who were the abettors of this unwarrantable proceed|ing.</P>
<P>We may perceive, from the above cir|cum&s;tance, how jealous Parliament HAVE BEEN of their &s;upremacy and uncontroul|able authority over the Colonies. Another in&s;tance mu&s;t carry the proof of this po&s;i|tion beyond the power of reply.

<PB N="42" REF="014727_0040_0F9488E434719150">

They re&s;olved, <Q>That the Act pa&s;|&s;ed in the 6th of Queen Anne, a&s;cer|taining the rates of Foreign Coin in Ame|rica, had not been duly ob&s;erved. That many indirect practices, in that re&s;pect, had been introduced, contrary to the true intent of the Act. That an Addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty to require the Governors of his Colonies to take effectual mea&s;ures for the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the Act of the 6th of Queen Anne, That another Addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ent|ed, reque&s;ting his Maje&s;ty to i&s;&s;ue his Royal Proclamation, to &s;ettle and a&s;cer|tain the rates of Foreign Gold Coins. That the CREATING and i&s;&s;uing Bills of Credit, in the Briti&s;h Colonies, by vir|tue of Acts of A&s;&s;embly, had fru&s;trated the de&s;ign of the Act of the 6th of Queen Anne.

&s;uch unwarrantable practices; and to ex|tend to America, the penalties inflicted by a Statute of the 6th of George I. on per&s;ons guilty of &s;uch practices in the&s;e kingdoms.</Q> They were al&s;o &s;ubjected, by the &s;ame Act, to the penalty and forfei|ture ordained by the Statute of Provi&s;ion and PREMUNIRE of the 16th of Richard the Second.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other Statutes by which Parliament with equal force a&s;&s;ert their au|thority over the Colonies. In &s;ome of the&s;e they carry this authority beyond the limits, with which they have hitherto circum&s;cribed it in this Kingdom. In the 29th of George II. cap. 35. Officers of the Army are em|powered to enli&s;t, in the Colonies, appren|tices and indented &s;ervants. The per&s;ons &s;o enli&s;ted were exempted from arre&s;ts in civil actions, where the value of the action ex|ceeds not ten pounds. To the&s;e &s;triking in&s;tances of the controuling power of Parlia|ment over the Colonies, may be added the Act of 23d of George II. cap. 29. By that Act, <Q>every per&s;on erecting or working any mill or other engine for &s;litting or rolling iron, or any plating forge or furnace for making &s;teel, is &s;ubjected to a penalty of 200l. to be recovered in any of the

Courts in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, or in the Court of Exchequer in Scotland.</Q></P>
<P>The foregoing recital of Statutes binding the Colonies, prior to the pre&s;ent reign, of which the Congre&s;s &s;o much complain, is &s;ufficient to convince the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, that the controuling power of Parliament has been perpetually exerted, and never di&s;|puted. There is hardly any object of Le|gi&s;lation in which the laws of this country have not bound America. Taxation has been purpo&s;ely omitted in the above detail. That article, as the great object of con|te&s;t, ought to be &s;eparately &s;tated. I &s;hall, therefore, throw into one point of view, all the in&s;tances of the exerci&s;e of the power of the Briti&s;h Parliament in that ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance of Taxation is the Act of the 12th of Charles II. for granting to the Crown a duty of Tonnage and Pound|age. This Act is in point. It directs, that the duties above mentioned <Q>&s;hall be pay|able upon Commodities not only imported into the realm of England, but al&s;o into the DOMINIONS THEREUNTO BELONGING.</Q> The Colonies are here included in expre&s;s words. It is true, indeed, that the Duties of Tonnage and Poundage were NOT col|lected in America. The rea&s;on was, that the commerce of the plantations was &s;o in|con&s;iderable,
<PB N="46" REF="014727_0044_0F9488E69791A548">
that the revenue ari&s;ing from it could not pay the expence of collection.</P>
<P>But whatever might have been the rea&s;on for NOT collecting the Duties of Tonnage and Poundage in the Colonies, the Law was certainly under&s;tood to extend to Ame|rica. In the year 1680, the A&s;&s;embly of the I&s;land of Jamaica refu&s;ed <Q>to rai&s;e le|vies for the &s;upport of Government.</Q> Upon this refu&s;al, the Lords of the Council made a Minute <Q>to confer with the Judges upon the que&s;tion: Whether the &s;ub&s;idies upon the Tonnage and Poundage upon goods that may by Law, or &s;hall be directly carried to Jamaica, be not payable, according to Law, by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects inhabiting that I&s;land, or trading there, by virtue of the Acts of Tonnage and Poundage, or other Acts made in England?</Q> Unfortunately it does not appear, whether the conference was ever held; or if it was actually held, what was the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>The 25th of Charles II. cap. 7. is the next Act that binds America, in point of Taxation. By that Act certain duties are made payable in the Plantations, upon &s;ugar, tobacco, cotton-wool, indigo, gin|ger, logwood, fu&s;tic, and other dying woods, and cocoa-nuts exported to any other place, except England. The&s;e Du|ties continue to be paid to this day.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="014727_0045_0F9488E7855B3740">
In the 9th of Queen Anne, an act was pa&s;&s;ed, impo&s;ing certain Duties on all prize-goods taken in America, and imported into any of the Colonies. The&s;e Duties were as follows: <Q>All European goods (wine and brandy excepted) which have been u&s;ually &s;ent to the Plantations, are to pay THERE &s;uch Cu&s;toms, as are payable for the like goods imported into the Plantations from Great-Britain. Other goods taken as prizes &s;hall be liable THERE to &s;uch Duties as were payable for the &s;ame, by any Act of A&s;&s;embly, in the &s;aid Plantations.</Q></P>
<P>To the&s;e Acts, &s;ubjecting his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in America to Taxes impo&s;ed by the Briti&s;h Parliament, &s;everal others may be added. The Act of the 9th of Queen Anne, for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Po&s;t-office. The various acts pa&s;&s;ed for levying and inforcing the collection of the duty of &s;ix-pence per month, out of Seamen's wages, for the &s;upport of Greenwich Ho&s;pital. All the&s;e acts extend to America. They bind the Colonies, as well as the Mother-Country. Their authority was never di&s;puted; and the Taxes impo&s;ed by them have been uni|formly rai&s;ed. The act of the 2d of George II. cap. 7. is &s;till more explicit and deci&s;ive in the words. It requires the payment of the duties for Greenwich Ho&s;pital, <Q>by
<PB N="48" REF="014727_0046_0F9488E85EFBE668">
&s;eamen belonging to American &s;hips, whe|ther employed upon the high &s;eas, or in any port, harbour, bay or creek, within ANY of the Colonies.</Q></P>
<P>It appears from this detail of facts, that the right of parliament to bind the colonies, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, is not a claim founded on mere theory; on the contrary, that the controuling power of the Legi&s;lature is warranted by con&s;tant u&s;age, and uninter|rupted practice. That the Declaratory Act, of which the Americans complain, con|tains no new, no a&s;&s;umed powers over the Plantations; and that there is &s;carce any channel of Legi&s;lation, through which the Briti&s;h Parliament has NOT exerted its &s;u|premacy, in as full and ample a manner as it has been exerted over the inhabitants of Great-Britain; and all this prior to the pre|&s;ent reign, in which the Congre&s;s place the commencement of "Public Ruin."</P>
<P>The American Congre&s;s, with a partia|lity for them&s;elves &s;carcely con&s;i&s;tent with their de&s;ign of gaining others, in the next paragraph of their Declaration, call the Acts, which were the CONSEQUENCE of the re&s;i&s;tance of their con&s;tituents, the CAUSE of their rebellion. In de&s;cending to particulars, their fir&s;t complaint is &s;tated again&s;t <Q>the exten&s;ion of the Juri&s;diction
<PB N="49" REF="014727_0047_0F9488E8F10F76A8">
of the Courts of Admiralty and Vice-Admiralty beyond their former limits;</Q> by which, they alledge, <Q>the &s;ubject is deprived of his inherent right of a trial by Jury.</Q> The Congre&s;s &s;urely forget, or it is not con&s;i&s;tent with their de&s;ign to remem|ber, that the alternations of which they complain were made at the reque&s;t of their con&s;tituents. The rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for this reque&s;t were, that the Courts of Admiralty e&s;tabli&s;hed formerly in the various Pro|vinces, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o little dignity, on ac|count of the dependance and poverty of the judges, that ju&s;tice was either &s;acrificed to connexions, or bia&s;&s;ed by avarice. Be&s;ides that, appeals to Great-Britain could be &s;el|dom made, on account of the expence and di&s;tance. To remedy this evil, the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment of Courts of Admiralty in America was formed. Four great Courts of Vice Admiralty were erected. The Judges were rendered independent by ample &s;alaries. The line of appeal became &s;hort, ea&s;y, and obvious; and as to trial by Jury, the whole world knows that the Court of Admiralty in England never admitted that mode of trial in CIVIL ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The complaint of the Congre&s;s, with re|gard to the Bill for &s;hutting the Port of Bo&s;|ton, is ridiculous as well as unju&s;t, as the
<PB N="50" REF="014727_0048_0F9488EA030F8DD8">
inhabitants of that place had it in their own power to remove the grievance. The de|&s;truction of the Ea&s;t India Company's tea, at Bo&s;ton, is well known to have been the deliberate act of a very great majority of the inhabitants. To obtain reparation by the common cour&s;e of law was impo&s;&s;ible, where the number of the offenders &s;creened them effectually from ju&s;tice. It was a pub|lic crime, and the puni&s;hment ought to have been general. In pur&s;uance of that plan of tenderne&s;s, which has been fatally lo&s;t on the Americans, the Bill for &s;u&s;pending the trade of Bo&s;ton was rendered conditional. A door was left open for an immediate re|conciliation, &s;hould the A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts Bay make a public grant, for re|pairing the damage &s;u&s;tained, by a company of Merchants, through a public outrage. Yet the Congre&s;s &s;tigmatize with the name of inju&s;tice, a coercive &s;tatute rendered ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary by the &s;hamele&s;s depreda|tions of the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton; and which &s;tatute, they them&s;elves had it in their power to terminate, in an in&s;tant, by doing an act of common ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>With equal effrontery, and with &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on, the Congre&s;s exclaim again&s;t the al|teration made in the form of the government of Bo&s;ton. With their u&s;ual fallacy in ar|gument,

the Americans wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h it as a maxim in polity, That Charters grant|ed by the CROWN, can neither be rever&s;ed or altered by the LEGISLATURE. They might as well go at once to the whole &s;u|premacy; and &s;ave them&s;elves the trouble of thus &s;upporting a cau&s;e untenable on any other grounds. The three branches of the Legi&s;lature united make daily alterations in the Con&s;titution of Great Britain; and, if their &s;upremacy extends over the whole em|pire, they have the &s;ame right to alter the Con&s;titution of the American Colonies. If the Americans deny this po&s;ition, all argu|ment is at an end; and they avow an inde|pendance, which, in THEIR circum&s;tances, marks them out for enemies. After all, this alteration of which the Congre&s;s affect to complain, is no more than putting the in|habitants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay on the &s;ame footing with the other Colonies. They have received in miniature the counter-part of the con&s;titution of the Mother-King|dom; and have THEY a right, or can THEY wi&s;h to be more free than the free&s;t nation in the world?</P>
<P>The act for regulating the government of Quebec, furni&s;hes the Congre&s;s with an ample field for declamation. To inveigh again&s;t Popery and Arbitrary Power has been

ever a favourite topic with men, who wi&s;h to profit by the prejudices of the people. Had the Congre&s;s attended to the general principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, they might have informed them&s;elves, that His Maje&s;ty, without the interpo&s;ition of the two other branches of the Legi&s;lature, might have permitted the inhabitants of Canada to remain for ever under French laws. There is no maxim in the law of England more generally known or le&s;s controverted than, That in conquered or ceded countries, which have already laws of their own, &s;uch laws remain in full force, till they are alter|ed and changed by the Sovereign. Had His Maje&s;ty, therefore, entertained &s;uch de&s;igns, as the Congre&s;s obliquely lay to his charge, why &s;hould he call in the aid of the Legi&s;lature to execute what was already done by the common law? The Congre&s;s will not, &s;urely, affirm, that the &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Legi&s;lature in Quebec, is &s;o arbitrary in it&s;elf, or &s;o fit for the purpo&s;es of de&s;poti&s;m, as the con&s;titu|tion which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in that Province under the French. Ought they not to con&s;ider, that no other form of government could have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;o &s;uitable to the di&s;|po&s;ition of the inhabitants, the tenures of their property, and the toleration of their

<P>The Oppo&s;ition at HOME, as well as the Patriots ABROAD, have found an exten&s;ive &s;ubject for pathetic eloquence, in the form of Government now e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law in Canada. The FORMER have either very treacherous memories, or they change without any ceremony their opinions with their &s;ituation. Under the admini&s;tration of the EARL of CHATHAM, Mr. Morgan, Lord SHELBURNE's Secretary, was &s;ent pri|vately to America, as Commi&s;&s;ioner, to &s;et|tle and regulate a new code for the Govern|ment of Quebec. The Governor and chief Ju&s;tice of that Province, if I am not mi&s;taken, were joined with Morgan in this SECRET, but important commi&s;&s;ion. The mea&s;ure, it is &s;aid, was con&s;idered by the Board of Trade; it was certainly de|bated, if not adopted by the Cabinet, as far back as the year 1767, during the plenitude of the Earl of Chatham's power. Lord Camden was Chancellor, and gave his &s;anc|tion to regulations MORE APPLIED TO DESPOTISM than tho&s;e he reprobates at pre&s;ent.

<P>The Congre&s;s enumerate, among their complaints again&s;t the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, the Re&s;olution of Parliament to give its due force to an unrepealed &s;tatute pa&s;&s;ed in the time of Henry VIII. It is declared in the Re&s;olution, that upon this &s;tatute, trea&s;ons and mi&s;pri&s;ons of trea&s;on committed in any of his Maje&s;ty's dominions beyond &s;ea, &s;ub|ject to the Crown of Great-Britain, may be tried in England. Though this Re&s;olution is con&s;idered by the Congre&s;s as a part of the ideal &s;y&s;tem of en&s;lavement, with which they charge the King and Parliament, it contains no novelty, no uncommon &s;tretch of law. A thou&s;and in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind are upon record, long before the pre&s;ent di&s;|putes with America began. One in&s;tance is extremely remarkable; I mean the tran&s;|actions

in the Ca&s;e of the In&s;urrection in Antigua, in the year 1711. All the proceed|ings were founded on the Act of Henry VIII. Some of the In&s;urgents were &s;ent to Eng|land; they were tried upon that Satute; and that circum&s;tance has e&s;tabli&s;hed a pre|cedent which cannot be controverted. But had even a new law of this kind been made, what rea&s;on could the American Congre&s;s have to complain? Have not the prejudices; in&s;urrections, and even rebellion of their own countrymen totally interrupted the common cour&s;e of ju&s;tice over all the va&s;t Continent which they inhabit; and &s;hall the generality of the crime be admitted a competent excu&s;e again&s;t puni&s;hment?</P>
<P>From condemning the Acts of the Le|gi&s;lature, the Congre&s;s pa&s;s to complaints again&s;t their Sovereign, as well as his prin|cipal &s;ervants. They alledge, that the <Q>Americans have ince&s;&s;antly and ineffectu|ally be&s;ieged the Throne for ten years;</Q> yet conceal the rea&s;on, which was, That their demands, rather than reque&s;ts, were &s;uch as the Sovereign could not grant, con|&s;i&s;tent with the powers ve&s;ted in him by the Con&s;titution. They complain, that fleets and armies have been &s;ent to their country, to enforce the coercive laws enacted by the Legi&s;lature, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of

its &s;upremacy; yet they pa&s;s over in &s;ilence the outrages committed by them&s;elves, which rendered that mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary. Did they not draw the &s;word with one hand, when the other was &s;tretched forth with petitions for relief from pretended grievances? Did they not purcha&s;e arms, ammunition, and artillery, form magazines, enli&s;t &s;oldiers; and prepare, in every re&s;pect, for rebellion and war; when they affected to &s;peak the language of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and peace?</P>

Throughout the whole of their &s;trange Declaration, the American Congre&s;s appear to adapt their rea&s;onings to the weakne&s;s of the prejudiced, and their facts to the credu|lity of the ignorant.

<P>To &s;hew the nature of the Propo&s;ition which the Congre&s;s &s;tigmatize with the name of an "in&s;idious manoeuvre," &s;ome previous facts mu&s;t be explained. On the &s;econd of February, a motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Commons, for an Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, which was &s;oon after pre&s;ented, with the concurrence of the Lords. In this Addre&s;s, the two Hou&s;es having &s;tated &s;ome facts, were induced to declare, that a rebel|lion actually exi&s;ted at that time in the Pro|vince of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay: That this con|duct was the more inexcu&s;able, when it was con&s;idered with how much temper his Ma|je&s;ty and the two Hou&s;es of Parliament had acted, in &s;upport of the Laws and Con&s;titu|tion of Great Britain: That they were re|&s;olved never &s;o far to de&s;ert the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, as to relinqui&s;h ANY PART <HI>of the</HI> SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY <HI>over</HI> ALL <HI>his</HI> MAJESTY'S DOMINIONS, which the Law inve&s;ted in his Maje&s;ty and the two Hou&s;es of Parliament: That the conduct of the Americans was &s;ufficient to convince them of the nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;upremacy and pow|er:
<PB N="59" REF="014727_0057_0F9488F1B38CA7C0">
That, however, they had always been, and always &s;hould be ready to pay attention and regard to any real grievances, which &s;hould be laid before them in a DUTIFUL and CONSTITUTIONAL manner: That they reque&s;ted his Maje&s;ty to take the mo&s;t effec|tual mea&s;ures to enforce due obedience to the laws and authority of the Supreme Le|gi&s;lature: And that they were re&s;olved, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes, to &s;upport his Maje&s;ty again&s;t all rebellious at|tempts, in the maintenance of the ju&s;t rights of his Maje&s;ty and the two Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>
<P>In this addre&s;s the two Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, while they held forth the &s;word in one hand, evidently tendered the Olive-branch with the other.

This Re&s;olution, which was carried by a great majority, plainly marked the ground for a negotiation, and an equitable agree|ment with the Colonies. It was moderate, comprehen&s;ive, and explicit. It named the per&s;ons from whom the propo&s;als mu&s;t come, and tho&s;e to whom they were to be made. The end and purpo&s;e of the contri|bution were explained. The appropriation of the expected revenue was &s;pecified, and precluded every &s;u&s;picion of its being mi&s;|applied. Though the offer was conditional, it was plainly conclu&s;ive, as long as the Americans them&s;elves &s;hould adhere to the agreement. They had it in their power to tax them&s;elves, the great point for which they profe&s;&s;ed to contend; and the only right re&s;erved by the Legi&s;lature was to de|termine the QUANTUM of the &s;upply; and they alone can determine it, as being the &s;upreme power, who are the &s;ole judges of what is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the State. The Propo&s;ition, upon the whole, was AT LEAST as favourable to the preten&s;ions of the Americans, as to the claims of the Mother-Country. The former, therefore, mu&s;t have accepted the propo&s;al, had what they held forth to the Public formed the real principles of their oppo&s;ition.</P>

The minority in Parliament, who deem|ed nothing &s;o fatal to their own views, as an agreement with the Americans, upon equitable, and con&s;equently permanent terms, oppo&s;ed this Propo&s;ition as in&s;i|dious in its nature, and for that purpo&s;e rendered ob&s;cure and perplexed in its lan|guage. The American Demagogues, who&s;e influence can only exi&s;t in the mid&s;t of anarchy and confu&s;ion, oppo&s;ed it with &s;imilar views. The latter, indeed, have ap|proved &s;o much of the SENTIMENTS, or rather PROFESSIONS of the former, that they have, in their Declaration, echoed back their very words in Parliament. The ar|gument before went only to the claim of the Americans to be permitted, in their A&s;&s;emblies, to &s;ettle the mode of Taxation. They then demanded an exclu&s;ive privilege of fixing the amount or quantum of the &s;upply; and now they will give no &s;up|ply at all. But if neither the mode nor the quantum is to be left in the power of Parliament, what power has Parliament left, with regard to the taxing of the Americans? Ought the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature to lay humbly the wants of the Public before the PETTY Legi&s;latures of America, and reque&s;t their aid for the general &s;upport of Government? What would this be, but the total emanci|pation of the Colonies from that &s;upremacy for which we contend?</P>

The Americans formerly declared them|&s;elves willing to contribute to the exigencies and expences of the State, provided the de|mand &s;hould come by requi&s;ition from the King, and not by an immediate exertion of Parliamentary authority. This offer his Ma|je&s;ty declined, with that patrioti&s;m which has uniformly marked his own mea&s;ures, during his reign. Anxious for the happine&s;s of all his &s;ubjects, he cho&s;e to be the Monarch of one great and free Nation, rather than the Sove|reign of a number of petty States, weakened by their own di&s;union. Had his Maje&s;ty been actuated by tho&s;e motives of ambition, which are not uncommon among Princes, he would have eagerly clo&s;ed with the offers of the Americans. In&s;tead of mak|ing him&s;elf dependent, for the maintenance of his dignity, upon the grants of one A&s;&s;embly, he might have extricated him|&s;elf from even the fear of pecuniary difficul|ties, by a proper management of many A&s;&s;emblies. The repre&s;entatives of one Province might be gratified into the views of the Crown, from the revenue of another; Briti&s;h Members might receive the wages of corruption in America; and American Repre&s;entatives be &s;ent for the price of their votes to this Kingdom.</P>

But &s;ucceeding events have demon&s;trated, that the Americans were not &s;incere, in any one of their declarations, in favour of an amicable accommodation. The Propo&s;i|tions voted, on the 20th of February, came up to their own former demands; yet they evaded them, by treating them as in&s;idious. The truth is, they knew their own demerits towards this Country, and they could not believe, that propo&s;als &s;o highly favourable could have been, on her part, &s;incere. One good, however, has re&s;ulted from the Pro|po&s;itions. The Colonies, by rejecting them, have left no doubt remaining concerning their real intentions. They confine no longer their claims to the exclu&s;ive privi|lege of taxing them&s;elves. They aim, evi|dently, at a total independence in all mat|ters what&s;oever; and more particularly with regard to the Act of Navigation. They have long made &s;ecret but mo&s;t dan|gerous encroachments on this Palladium of our Commerce. They now publicly avow their re&s;olution to pay no regard to any Parliamentary re&s;trictions, whether ancient or recent, on their Commerce. They now openly trade all over Europe; and the ob|taining the privilege, which they have, at length, u&s;urped, has been the primary cau&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="014727_0063_0F9488F8861DD778">
of their re&s;i&s;tance to Parliament. The ma|nufacturers and merchants of this Country have been long no &s;trangers to this Ameri|can policy; yet the Congre&s;s have the ef|frontery to expect, that the mercantile in|tere&s;t of Great Britain will e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The American Congre&s;s, having in a loo&s;e, cur&s;ory, and &s;uperficial manner, ad|vanced &s;ome pretended arguments to ju&s;tify their rebellion, de&s;cend to the mi&s;repre&s;en|tation of facts, with the &s;ame de&s;ign. They affirm, <Q>That General Gage, who had occupied Bo&s;ton as a garri&s;on, &s;ent out a large detachment of his army, on the 19th of April, who made an unprovoked a&s;|&s;ault on the inhabitants of the Province of Bo&s;ton, at Lexington.</Q> On this alle|gation of the Congre&s;s, it may be remark|ed, that the rebellious conduct of the town of Bo&s;ton, where all the authority of legal government had been long extingui&s;hed by the tyranny of a rabble in&s;tigated by factious leaders, had rendered a force nece&s;&s;ary in that place, to re&s;tore order and tranquility, to protect the innocent, and to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;es of the turbulent and guilty. That the military preparations made in all parts of the Province, and e&s;pecially at the Town of Concord, with the avowed intention of
<PB N="66" REF="014727_0064_0F9488F9345BDAB8">
oppo&s;ing all legal authority, induced and even forced General Gage (though fatally too late) to &s;end out a detachment of the troops under his command, to prevent ho&s;ti|lities, by &s;eizing the means of carrying them on. That &s;ome of the Inhabitants of the Province, in "warlike array," &s;tood in the way of this detachment, with arms in their hands; and that when ordered to remove in a peaceable manner, they made <Q>an unpro|voked a&s;&s;ault</Q> on his Maje&s;ty's troops, by firing FIRST upon them, and killing &s;ome, and wounding many.</P>
<P>The audacity of the Congre&s;s, in a&s;&s;erting FALSEHOODS, demands a brief detail of the TRUTH. General Gage, having been in|formed, that arms, ammunition, cannon, and other implements of war, had been collected in the Town of Concord, ordered a detachment of the army to march with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecrecy to that place. He gave or|ders to the detachment, to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t &s;trict di&s;cipline, and to re&s;ent no in&s;ults of|fered them by the country people, except actual ho&s;tilities. The General's orders were, in truth, too implicitly ob&s;erved. There was not one LOADED MUSQUET in the whole detachment, except tho&s;e in the hands of FIFTY marines, who formed the van, when they were FIRED upon, by the
<PB N="67" REF="014727_0065_0F9488FB9037B7D8">
country people, at Lexington. The affida|vits of the rebels, on this &s;ubject, are im|po&s;itions and perjuries. There is not a man, whether officer or &s;oldier, in the whole de|tachment, con&s;i&s;ting of 800 men, but is ready, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to atte&s;t the truth of this fact.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed, for the honour of the in&s;urgents, that their BARBAROUS CRU|ELTY to the wounded &s;oldiers, were more problematical than their firing FIRST on the King's troops. The &s;oldiers who fell by the fir&s;t fire of the rebels, were found &s;calped, when the detachment returned from Concord to Lexington Bridge. Two &s;oldi|ers who lay wounded on the field, and had been &s;calped by the &s;avage Provincials, were &s;till breathing. They appeared, by the traces of blood, to have rolled in the agonies of this horrid &s;pecies of death, &s;everal yards from the place where they had been &s;calped. Near the&s;e unfortunate men, another dread|ful object pre&s;ented it&s;elf. A &s;oldier who had been &s;lightly wounded, appeared with his eyes torn out of their &s;ockets, by the barbarous mode of GOOGING, a word and practice peculiar to the Americans. Huma|nity forbids us to dwell longer on this &s;cene of horror. The rebels, to break the force of accu&s;ation, began to recriminate. They laid &s;everal in&s;tances of wanton cruelty to
<PB N="68" REF="014727_0066_0F9488FCA5F8CF58">
the charge of the troops; yet nothing is better a&s;certained, than that not one of the &s;oldiers ever quitted the road, either upon their march or return from Concord.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s &s;tigmatize the expedition to Lexington and Concord, with the epithets "of an unprovoked and wanton a&s;&s;ault." Was the collecting warlike implements at Concord, rai&s;ing men throughout the Pro|vince, di&s;ciplining troops in every di&s;trict, forming magazines, purcha&s;ing ammunition, and preparing arms, no provocation? Were not the whole country a&s;&s;embled before they knew of this expedition? And was not their being &s;o completely provided with the means of repelling ho&s;tilities, a &s;ufficient proof, that they had previou&s;ly re&s;olved to com|mence them? Could TEN THOUSAND men, the number that attacked (though at a PRUDENT di&s;tance) the troops on their re|treat, have been collected by accident, or called together by a &s;udden alarm? Are not the Congre&s;s con&s;cious to them&s;elves, and was not General Gage &s;ufficiently apprized, that the people of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay had determined to begin ho&s;tilities, had the ex|pedition to Concord never happened? The truth is, the march of the troops had only ha&s;tened the execution of the plan of rebel|lion &s;ettled before in the &s;ecret councils of the Provincial Congre&s;s.</P>

The a&s;&s;ertions of the Congre&s;s concerning tran&s;actions within the town of Bo&s;ton, are as utterly devoid of truth, as their account of what happened in the country. The ho&s;|tile intentions of tho&s;e WITHIN, were as ap|parent as the rebellion of their brethren WITHOUT was certain. The great law of &s;elf-defence mu&s;t therefore have ju&s;tified General Gage for having deprived the for|mer of arms, which they almo&s;t avowedly intended to rai&s;e again&s;t all legal authority. After the &s;kirmi&s;h at Lexington and Con|cord, all &s;upplies from the country were cut off from the town of Bo&s;ton. Many of the inhabitants de&s;ired to remove, with their effects. Their reque&s;t was granted; but it was at the &s;ame time demanded, that they &s;hould deliver up their arms. This was, at fir&s;t, approved by all; but great clamours &s;oon after followed. Such of the inhabitants as were well affected, or pretended to be well affected to Government, alledged, that none but the ill-inclined &s;hewed any incli|nation to remove; and that when they &s;hould become &s;afe with their effects, the town would be &s;et on fire. A great demur having al&s;o ari&s;en about the meaning of the word EFFECTS, whether MERCHANDISE was included; and the General being like|wi&s;e &s;en&s;ible, that the permitting articles of that kind to be carried to the rebels, might

<P>The next paragraph of the Declaration, as it is not &s;upported by truth, is addre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ions. The Congre&s;s complain, with an attempt at the pathos, <Q>of the &s;eparation of wives from their hu&s;bands, children from their parents, and the aged and &s;ick from their relations and friends.</Q> But is it not notorious to the whole world, that this SEPARATION, which the Congre&s;s af|fect to lament, was the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence of the rebellion of their countrymen? Did they not &s;urround the town of Bo&s;ton, with an armed force, with the avowed inten|tion of de&s;troying his Maje&s;ty's forces, Ge|nerals, and Governor? And were the gates to be left open "to let ruin enter," as one of their own writers expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf? Have the people of Bo&s;ton &s;uffered mere hard&s;hips than the inhabitants of be&s;ieged to was u&s;ually &s;uffer? Have they not even &s;uffered fewer re&s;traints than men in their &s;i|tuation had rea&s;on to expect. Was not Dr. Warren, the Chairman of the Provincial Congre&s;s, a notorious abettor of the in&s;ur|rection, a nominal General in a rebel army, permitted to come into Bo&s;ton, under pre|tence
<PB N="71" REF="014727_0069_0F9488FEAEDD9EA0">
of vi&s;iting a &s;ick friend, on the day preceding the action on Bunker's hill, where he was killed in arms again&s;t his King and Country? Is this a mark of tho&s;e cruel re|&s;traints, tho&s;e melancholy &s;eparations, of which the Congre&s;s complain? But THEIR bu&s;ine&s;s is to engage the pa&s;&s;ions, where they can make no impre&s;&s;ion with their arguments.</P>
<P>In the next paragraph of their Declaration, the Congre&s;s, with their u&s;ual want of impar|tiality and fairne&s;s, mention the CONSE|QUENCES of their own rebellion, as the cau&s;e of their taking up arms. They ob&s;erve, that General Gage i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation, <Q>declaring all the inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets-Bay rebels, &s;u&s;pending the cour&s;e of the Common Law, and publi&s;hing in&s;tead thereof the u&s;e and exerci&s;e of the Law Martial.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This he was authori&s;ed to do, as civil Governor, by a Law pa&s;&s;ed in the Province, many years ago.</NOTE> But, did he declare them rebels till they had attacked his Maje&s;ty's troops, &s;eized his forts and garri&s;ons, be&s;ieged his army in the capital of the Province, and not only interrupted the common cour&s;e of ju&s;|tice, but even totally annihilated all legal authority? It is with peculiar effrontery, that the Congre&s;s number the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the common cour&s;e of ju&s;tice among their grievances, after all law and order had been trodden under foot by their own countrymen.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="014727_0070_0F948900BAFBD2B0">
With the &s;ame degree of arrogant folly the Congre&s;s complain, that <Q>their countrymen were killed on Bunker's-hill, that Charles-Town was burnt to the ground, that their &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els have been &s;eized, that their &s;upplies of provi&s;ions have been in|tercepted, that General Carleton is in&s;ti|gating the Canadians and Indians again&s;t them, and that dome&s;tic enemies are en|couraged to attack them.</Q> All the&s;e things may certainly have happened; but have they not happened in con&s;equence of their own rebellion? Have they a right to attack others, and have others no right to defend them&s;elves? Do the inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay think, that as they have broken through all the ties that bind the &s;ubject to the Sovereign, the law of nature and of nations ought al&s;o to be &s;u&s;pended to gratify their ambition, to flatter their folly, to favour their extravagant &s;chemes of inde|pendence? To the above imaginary catalogue of American grievances, may be oppo&s;ed the ju&s;t complaints of Great-Britain. Have not the rebels carried their ho&s;tilities to every corner again&s;t the Parent-State, that fir&s;t gave them exi&s;tence, and reared them to pro&s;perity? Have they not attacked her troops at Lexington and at Concord, fired upon Bo&s;ton, burnt the Light-hou&s;e, taken Ticon|derago and Crown Point, and even pene|trated

<P>The conclu&s;ion of the Declaration, though laboured, contains nothing but empty de|clamation, and therefore merits little notice. The &s;ame di&s;regard to truth, or rather the &s;ame attention to mi&s;repre&s;entation, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the re&s;t of that &s;trange compo|&s;ition, is carried down to the end. They alledge, <Q>that they are reduced to the al|ternative of chu&s;ing an unconditional &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to tyranny, or re&s;i&s;tance by force.</Q> The Congre&s;s &s;urely forget, or it &s;uits their purpo&s;e to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, the favour|able (perhaps too favourable) conditions offered to them, by the Re&s;olution of the Commons, in the month of February la&s;t. The terms couched in that Re&s;olution were &s;o obviou&s;ly advantageous to America, that the Oppo&s;ition in Parliament declared them INSIDIOUS; or, in other words, <Q>too good to be &s;incere.</Q> An amicable &s;ettlement had cea&s;ed to have been an object with the Demagogues ABROAD; and it would have ruined the &s;chemes of the Faction at HOME. The FORMER derived their influence, con|&s;equence, and power, from anarchy and

confu&s;ion. THEY could exi&s;t only in a &s;torm. The re&s;toration of peace and tran|quility mu&s;t have reduced THEM to their original in&s;ignificance; and as for the latter, rendered de&s;perate by di&s;appointed ambition, they would not he&s;itate to ruin their coun|try, to procure the fall of their rivals.</P>
<P>Such being the &s;tate of opinions among the leaders of Faction on both &s;ides of the Atlantic, <Q>re&s;i&s;tance by force became na|turally the choice of the Congre&s;s.</Q> To deceive an unhappy people, over who&s;e minds they had e&s;tabli&s;hed a temporay do|minion, they boa&s;t of <Q>their perfect union, and their great INTERNAL re&s;ources; and that foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance is attainable.</Q> As to the fir&s;t, we have no rea&s;on to give it impli|cit credit. The &s;hew of unanimity, which now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in America, appears, from un|doubted information, to be the effect of fear, more than any love for the de&s;perate cau&s;e of the rebels. Men of property are, from intere&s;t, enemies to confu&s;ion; and the intelligent, fore&s;eeing the inevitable i&s;&s;ue of ho&s;tilities again&s;t the invincible power of a mighty Empire, are aver&s;e to a conte&s;t, that, on the &s;ide of the Americans, mu&s;t terminate in ruin. But BOTH are ter|rified into &s;ilence by the tyranny of a mi&s;led rabble; or their STILL VOICE is drowned in the clamours of Faction and tumult of Party.</P>

The INTERNAL RESOURCES of the Amer|icans are as problematical, as their unanimity in rebellion. Con&s;i&s;t the&s;e mighty re&s;ources in a wretched Paper-currency, e&s;tabli&s;hed on no o&s;ten&s;ible fund of credit; and voted by an illegal a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e authority is feeble, on account of its novelty&punc; and tran|&s;itory, as it ari&s;es from temporary prejudi|ces?

Can they &s;upply their armies with tents, with powder, with cannon, or with mu&s;kets? Is any one of the&s;e articles manufactured in a &s;ufficient quantity in America? And how can they be procured in Europe, with the wretched currency of the General Congre&s;s?</P>
<P>The Coloni&s;ts, had not rea&s;on been warped by prejudice in every part of their conduct, might have fore&s;een, that their commencing a war deprived them in&s;tantly of the re&s;ources for carrying it on. Their whole Coa&s;t is lined, it is to be hoped, at this very moment, with our &s;hips of war, to put a total &s;top to their Commerce. They have, therefore, lo&s;t at one &s;troke their

<P>But if the Americans have little rea&s;on to depend on DOMESTIC RESOURCES, they have &s;till le&s;s to hope from FOREIGN AID. Will France, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her finances, involve her&s;elf in a ruinous and expen&s;ive war, to gratify the revenge of a Faction in this Country, or to favour the ambition of Demagogues beyond the Atlantic? Will Spain give her a&s;&s;i&s;tance to rai&s;e an INDE|PENDENT EMPIRE in America? Will &s;he encourage her own American &s;ubjects to ri&s;e again&s;t her authority, by abetting the rebel|lion of the American &s;ubjects of Great-Britain? Can either branch of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon be &s;o blind to its own intere&s;t, as to wi&s;h to &s;ee a Sovereign State erected &s;o

<P>Having endeavoured to terrify Great-Britain with their DOMESTIC re&s;ources and FOREIGN aids; the Congre&s;s thinking, per|haps, they had gone too far, conclude with a&s;&s;urances, that <Q>they have not yet deter|mined to di&s;&s;olve their union with the Mother-Country.</Q> But that UNION, it ap|pears from the &s;equel, mu&s;t not be con|&s;trued into SUBORDINATION, on the part of the Americans.

Some allowance ought to be made for THEIR ignorance, and a great deal for the petulance of men now to con&s;equence and authority; but, even in that ca&s;e, the in&s;o|lence of the Declaration is calculated to rai&s;e indignation, as well as contempt. The Congre&s;s, however, are only the echoes of a de&s;perate faction in this Kingdom, who have uniformly, in their public exhibitions, degraded the &s;trength, power, and authority of Great-Britain, to exalt America on the ruins. With an effrontery without example in any other age or nation, THESE MEN a&s;&s;ume the name of Patriots, yet lay the honor, dignity, and reputation of their Country under the feet of her rebellious &s;ubjects.

<P>It appears, upon the whole, that the De|claration, which ought to contain all the ar|gument in &s;avour of the Americans, con|tains, in fact, nothing that does not militate again&s;t their cau&s;e. The right of taxing all the &s;ubjects of the Empire, for the gene|ral &s;upport of the State, is a part of that Supremacy which the fir&s;t principles of the Con&s;titution have ve&s;ted in the Briti&s;h Le|gi&s;lature. This Supremacy has been exerted by Parliament, and admitted by the Ameri|cans, ever &s;ince their ance&s;tors migrated from the&s;e kingdoms. If they now deny it, by that very act they cea&s;e to be &s;ubjects, and become rebels. But granting, for the &s;ake of argument, that Taxation is no part of the &s;upremacy of Parliament, the very conduct of the Americans not only ju&s;ti|fies, but even renders it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that a precedent &s;hould be made. They own, <Q>that their internal re&s;ources are great.</Q> The inability of contributing to the nece&s;&s;ities of a State, from whom they have derived their origin, their &s;upport, their protection, and their pro&s;perity, is no longer a pretence; and if they will give no Reve|nue as &s;ubjects, they owe a debt as allies. They affect to maintain armies by land.
<PB N="80" REF="014727_0078_0F94890A9B475278">
They threaten to &s;end fleets to &s;ea. They alledge, that their re&s;ources are capable of &s;upporting a rebellion again&s;t the Mother-Country; yet they ju&s;tifiy that rebellion by the demand made by the Mother-Country, for their bearing a part of their own FUTURE EXPENCES.</P>
<P>That the former expences of America have drawn from Great-Britain an incredible trea&s;ure, may be &s;een from the following authentic e&s;timate. We &s;hall begin this e&s;|timate with the acce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Hanover to the Throne of the&s;e Kingdoms.</P>

To this amazing &s;um might be added, by implication, the other expences of the two la&s;t Wars. The FORMER of tho&s;e wars was undertaken for the protection of the American Commerce, or rather American SMUGGLING, to the Spani&s;h Colonies. We entered into the LATTER for the defence of the Coloni&s;ts; we carried it on for their &s;ecurity; and terminated it for their SOLE advantage. The two la&s;t Wars have co&s;t this Country, at a moderate computation, ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS. To this extraordinary wa&s;te of trea&s;ure, what have the Colonies to oppo&s;e to balance the account? Is it a languid Commerce, which &s;carcely makes its returns once in three years?</P>
<P>We have heard much (indeed, a great deal too much) of this Commerce from fac|tious men on both &s;ides of the Atlantic. This is the mighty engine which they wield over the heads of the ignorant; the great bug-bear with which they terrify the timid. To e&s;timate the value of the American trade with any degree of preci&s;ion, is impo&s;&s;ible. The accounts kept in the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e are no authorities. When exports pay no duty&punc; a door is opened to fal&s;e entries. The vanity of &s;ome Merchants, the intere&s;t of others,
<PB N="82" REF="014727_0080_0F94890C05BCFE80">
too frequently induce them to magnify, be|yond mea&s;ure, the quantity of their export trade. Be&s;ides, the mercantile abettors of American re&s;i&s;tance thought they &s;erved the Colonies, whil&s;t they gratified their own private views. We may conclude, that the Commerce with North America has been greatly over-rated, as the TOTAL LOSS of it has NOT affected this Kingdom. We ought, perhaps, to a&s;cribe to ITS INSIGNIFICANCE what we are taught to attribute to an IN|CREASE in other channels of trade.</P>
<P>Like all monopolies, the Commerce with North-America, &s;uch as it has been, was much more profitable to the Merchant, than advantageous to the Manufacturer. One-third of this commerce with any State in Europe (from which the returns are annual) would have brought equal profit to the ma|nufacturer, and would have enabled him to employ an equal number of hands. Politi|cal impo&s;tors will not fail to advance mag|nificent fictions on this head, and the igno|rant cannot cea&s;e to give them credit. On a &s;ubject where proofs are &s;o difficult to be obtained, one may hazard a conjecture. The money expended by this Nation upon America, for the PROTECTION of HER in|habitants and the ENCOURAGEMENT of
<PB N="83" REF="014727_0081_0F94890CB2389528">
HER Commerce, would have been more than &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e ALL the ma|nufactures ever exported from Great-Britain to the Colonies now in rebellion. I mean not to include, in this conjectural e&s;timate, any &s;ums expended by us in any OTHER part of the world during the two la&s;t (truly American) Wars.</P>
<P>The Americans, with a degree of folly &s;carce excu&s;able in the mo&s;t con&s;ummate ig|norance, claim a merit with Great-Britain, for the Revenue ari&s;ing from impo&s;ts laid upon &s;ome of their commodities, in THIS Kingdom. The chief of the&s;e are Rice and Tobacco. The Revenue ari&s;ing from Rice is &s;o in&s;ignificant, that it &s;carce de&s;erves to be mentioned. It never amounted, at the highe&s;t computation, to ten thou&s;and pounds in any one year. Tobacco, when re-exported, pays no duty; and it is a matter of great doubt, whether the frauds committed in the draw-backs may not nearly balance the o&s;ten&s;ible Revenue ari&s;ing to the Sate from the home con&s;umption.</P>
<P>But granting, a great Revenue &s;hould ari&s;e from Rice and Tobacco to the State, what favour do we owe to our Colonies on that head? That Revenue is paid by OUR|SELVES. The Tax is on the Con&s;umer,
<PB N="84" REF="014727_0082_0F94890DCA632630">
and not upon the Planter. Should Siberia &s;upply us with Rice and Tobacco, the price would not probably be greater to the Con&s;u|mer, nor the Revenue le&s;s to the State. If the Americans claim any merit from tho&s;e Taxes, what do we not owe to the Empe|ror of China? The Revenue from Tea is much more con&s;iderable than that from Rice and Tobacco. A Congre&s;s at Pekin might accu&s;e us of ingratitude on this &s;ubject, with as much ju&s;tice as the A&s;&s;embly lately &s;itting at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>It is evident from the above &s;tate of facts, that the Colonies have no claim to an ex|emption from Taxation, on account of any advantage that has accrued to this country from their commerce. But Taxation has now cea&s;ed to be any part of the di&s;pute. It goes to the whole authority of the Mother-Country. The Americans offer no longer the very name of Obedience. But why &s;hould I &s;peak of Obedience? This VERY CONGRESS, who&s;e Declaration is the &s;ubject of this di&s;qui&s;ition, have pa&s;&s;ed a VOTE OF INDEPENDENCE. They have long acted as rebels, they NOW affect to contend as enemies. Their abettors in this Kingdom are no &s;trangers to this circum|&s;tance; yet they dignify avowed rebellion
<PB N="85" REF="014727_0083_0F94890E31E53D38">
with the title of "A GLORIOUS STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM.</P>
<P>Such is the conduct of the Americans, to which that of Great-Britain has all along formed a &s;triking contra&s;t. With the in|dulgence and patience of a Parent, &s;he &s;oothed, flattered, and even courted them to a reconciliation. In pity to the weakne&s;s, in conde&s;cen&s;ion to the folly, in con&s;idera|tion to the prejudices of a froward child, &s;he held out the olive branch when &s;he ought, perhaps, to have &s;tretched forth the rod of correction. Her pity, her kindne&s;s, and affection, were lo&s;t upon the Americans. They advanced rapidly from claim to claim, and con&s;trued her forbearance into timidity. Each Act that was repealed, furni&s;hed a &s;ubject for triumph, and not an object for gratitude. Each conce&s;&s;ion became the foundation of &s;ome new demand, till, at length, by a&s;&s;uming all to them&s;elves by rebellion, they left the Mother-Country nothing to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of affairs, Great-Britain mu&s;t pur&s;ue one of two lines of conduct, with regard to her refractory Colonies. She mu&s;t either put up with the lo&s;s of ALL her expence, and emancipate them forever, or reduce them to that &s;tate of dependence
<PB N="86" REF="014727_0084_0F948912433A0108">
which &s;ubjects owe to the &s;upreme authority in every Empire. As the latter line mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be pur&s;ued, it ought to be pur|&s;ued with a mixture of &s;pirit and prudence. To be in every re&s;pect in a condition to force equitable terms is the be&s;t &s;ecurity for their being voluntarily offered. But &s;hould terms be offered by the rebels, the RIGHTS of THIS COUNTRY mu&s;t be more regarded in the accommodation, than the CLAIMS of AMERICA. To permit the Colonies to GAIN by one rebellion, is to &s;ow the &s;eeds of another. But if the Colonies, as com|munities, are not permitted to <HI>gain</HI> by their refractory conduct, I am far from wi&s;hing that individuals &s;hould <HI>lo&s;e</HI> any part of their rights as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>To propo&s;e a plan to the Americans, in their pre&s;ent political frenzy, would be to &s;peak to the winds. To make them <HI>le&s;s</HI> free than the other &s;ubjects of the State, can never be the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of this Country. To obtain <HI>greater</HI> privileges, can &s;carcely be their own <HI>de&s;ign.</HI> If they are not madly bent on independence, let them propo&s;e the conditions on which they wi&s;h to continue &s;ubjects. But if they are to continue &s;ub|jects, they mu&s;t perform their duty as &s;uch, and contribute towards the expence of
<PB N="87" REF="014727_0085_0F948914598562E0">
the State, for the general protection. The Legi&s;lature of this Kingdom cannot po&s;&s;ibly depart from any part of its &s;upremacy over the Colonies; but it is in the power of the Colonies to &s;hare in that &s;upremacy. If they complain of being taxed without hav|ing the privilege of &s;ending Members to Parliament, let them be repre&s;ented. Nay, more: Let their repre&s;entation increa&s;e in proportion to the Revenue they &s;hall fur|ni&s;h. If they wi&s;h rather to vote their QUOTA towards the general &s;upply, through their own General Courts and A&s;&s;emblies, the re&s;olution of Parliament on that &s;ubject is &s;till open to their choice.</P>
<P>But as long as they a&s;&s;ume the language of a Sovereign State, this Kingdom can en|ter into no negociation, can meet no com|promi&s;e. Nations, as well as individuals, have a character, a certain dignity, which they mu&s;t pre&s;erve at the ri&s;que of their ex|i&s;tence. Great-Britain has obeyed the dic|tates of humanity beyond the limits pre|&s;cribed by her reputation. To tempt her further, is full of peril, as her indignation begins to ri&s;e. She has long had rea&s;on to complain of American ingratitude; and &s;he will not bear longer with American inju&s;tice. The dangerous re&s;entment of a great people
<PB N="88" REF="014727_0086_0F948915B5FFDA40">
is ready to bur&s;t forth. They already be|gin to a&s;k, with vehemence, is this the re|turn we ought to expect from Colonies, whom with parental indulgence we have cheri&s;hed in infancy, protected in youth, and reared to manhood? Have we &s;pent in their cau&s;e &s;o much trea&s;ure, and have they the ingratitude to refu&s;e to bear a &s;mall portion of our burdens? Have we &s;pilt &s;o much of the blood of their enemies, and do they re|pay us by imbruing their hands in our own? The law of God and of Nature is on the &s;ide of an indulgent Parent, again&s;t an un|dutiful Child; and &s;hould nece&s;&s;ary correc|tion render him incapable of future offence, he has only his own ob&s;tinacy and folly to blame.</P>

<HEAD>A few more WORDS, on the FREEDOM of the PRESS, Addre&s;&s;ed by the PRINTER, to the FRIENDS of LIBERTY in AMERICA.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Since the PRESS is FREE, LONG may it REMAIN FREE, mu&s;t be the fervent wi&s;h of every Friend to real Freedom. 
<BIBL>BELL.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was the &s;aying of an Ancient, and wi&s;e ENGLISHMAN, (TINDAL) who lived at the time of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, That, <Q>While the Freedom of the PRESS is pre&s;erved, all other Liberties, both Civil and Religious, will be &s;ecured to us, under &s;o faithful a Guardian.</Q> And it is the decla|ration of the modern, and noble VIRGINIANS, <Q>that the Freedom of the PRESS is one of the great bulwarks of Liberty, and can never be re&s;trained but by de&s;potic governments.</Q> Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e worthy and e&s;timable authorities, if there are yet any number of mi&s;taken men exi&s;ting, who under the &s;pecious pretence of there being a nece&s;&s;ity at &s;ome try|ing exigence for a temporary re&s;triction of the FREEDOM of the PRESS, and their fooli&s;h advice &s;hould at any one time be adopted, we may then bid a final adieu to every thing per|taining to Liberty: For it is more than pro|bable, that like unto the wretched Briti&s;h Par|liament, in the Year 1716, who pretended, there were at that time, too many Jacobites in the nation, to &s;uffer the triennial election of Members for that Hou&s;e&mdash;They then tyranni|cally con&s;tituted them&s;elves into a &s;eptennial par|liament: And for the la&s;t &s;ixty years, have illegally and audaciou&s;ly committed one con|tinued in&s;ult upon the con&s;titution of the King|dom, and upon the under&s;tandings of the whole

body of the people in Great-Britain.&mdash;Now, if Americans will agreeable to the good old Eng|li&s;h advice&mdash;
<Q><L>Learn to be wi&s;e, from others harm,</L>
<L>Then, they &s;hall do full well;</L></Q>
But, if according to the opinion of &s;ome vio|lents again&s;t the freedom of enquiry, they will unwi&s;ely trample upon that greate&s;t of all pri|vileges, the Liberty of the PRESS; then will they, like the fooli&s;h people of Britain, commit &s;uicide on their own liberties, and thus, entail upon them&s;elves, the &s;corn and contempt of all true and con&s;i&s;tent friends to real Liberty, be|cau&s;e, if new modes of Government, are either in reality, or in appearance, approaching to|wards the inhabitants of America; it is more peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary on the&s;e extraordinary oc|ca&s;ions, that the Liberty of the PRESS &s;hould be freely exerted: For, if in the&s;e changes, we do not fully retain all our pre&s;ent happy privi|leges, but weakly &s;uffer any re&s;trictions or cur|tailings of Liberty to advance upon us with new e&s;tabli&s;hments, it will afterwards be next to im|po&s;&s;ible to regain the de&s;irable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus far the Printer &s;till thinks it indi&s;pen|&s;ibly his duty to &s;upport the Freedom of the PRESS, in which all the lovers of genuine Liberty are deeply intere&s;ted. And, if there are any, who think otherwi&s;e, they may if they plea&s;e, peru&s;e what follows.</P>

<P>IT is &s;aid the wi&s;e Italians make this pro|verbial Remark on our Nation, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> The Engli&s;h FEEL, but they do not SEE. That is, they are &s;en&s;ible of inconveniencies when they are pre&s;ent, but do not take &s;ufficient care to prevent them: Their natural courage makes them too little apprehen&s;ive of danger, &s;o that they are often &s;urprized by it, un|provided of the proper means of &s;ecurity. When 'tis too late they are &s;en&s;ible of their im|prudence: After great fires, they provide buckets and engines: After a pe&s;tilence they think of keeping clean their &s;treets and com|mon &s;hores: and when a town has been &s;ack'd by their enemies, they provide for its de|fence.
