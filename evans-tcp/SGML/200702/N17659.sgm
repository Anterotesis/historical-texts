<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of reformation in the modern &s;y&s;tem of novels, is obvious to every reader of ta&s;te and judgment.&mdash;The general plan upon which events are founded to carry on a train of incidents in modern compo&s;ition, is not the repre&s;entation of nature, in &s;howing things as they occur in human life;&mdash;but an artificial colour|ing, to plea&s;e the imagination at the expen&s;e of common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on;&mdash;by portraying, in an extravagant manner, the hero or heroine of the narrative, to be all perfection;&mdash;pa&s;&s;ing thro' the &s;cenes of action with &s;uch eclat, that &s;imple nature has nothing to do in the romantic exploits that are performed;&mdash;&s;acrificing at all hazards the complexion of truth, probability, and pro|priety, to pre&s;erve the favourite of the narrative from all terre&s;trial misfortunes; precluding the cru&s;h of accidents, the inva&s;ion of di&s;tempers, and the horrors of death!&mdash;Thus fini&s;hing the piece egregiou&s;ly daubed,&mdash;and varni&s;hed roman|tically extravagant and outr&eacute;.</P>
<P>The plan laid down in the following narrative is quite counter to the foregoing method, being a faithful tran&s;cript from the volume of human nature;&mdash;wherein hyberbole is utterly excluded, and regular delineations are attempted, to di&s;|countenance vice and reward virtue.&mdash;Yet to per|form
<PB N="ii" REF="022876_0003_0FBA98E2BAECD6C0">
the latter, the fenced field of probability is not over&s;tept;&mdash;but a continued view of it pre|&s;erved throughout the performance.&mdash;The co|louring is without elaborate art or &s;lovenly care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s,&mdash;for either of them are di&s;gu&s;ting:&mdash; &s;o that no character is introduced that performs a part either above or below the regulated &s;tand|ard of nature.</P>
<P>In this work the reader may find &s;ome digre&s;|&s;ions, which are intended to &s;erve &s;uch ends as &s;ecure a pardon for the liberty;&mdash;for rational in|&s;truction is the &s;ole aim of &s;uch deviations from the u&s;ual method of narration.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle will perhaps be found on a different plan to that u&s;ed by noveli&s;ts,&mdash;but an elevation is attempted:&mdash;yet the common place adoption of egoti&s;m is exploded:&mdash;this compo&s;ition being chief|ly de&s;igned for the u&s;e of the fair &s;ex, to give them a ta&s;te for the &s;tudy of &s;cience, &s;o far as the cau&s;e of virtue, morality, and religion will permit.</P>
<P>Many objections may be made to the innova|tion by this plan, but every per&s;on of rational endowments will coincide in the opinion of that excellent genius, Shake&s;peare, who ob&s;erves, "That in many privileged practices, they would be better in the breach than the performance or ob&s;ervance."</P>

<HEAD>THE SCHOOL OF VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the delightful County of Devon lived Sir William Howard, a Baronet of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed abilities; who&s;e &s;entiments in the grand council of the nation were on &s;everal occa&s;ions applauded by every member, who, like him, wi&s;hed for the pro&s;perity of his country, before that of degrading &s;elf-inte|re&s;t;&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing at once the real and un|common titles of patrioti&s;m and hone&s;ty:&mdash; for then, as well as at this time, the&s;e two epithets bore a different &s;ignification.&mdash;But le&s;t my fair readers &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e I mean to de&s;cant on the theory or practice of Po|litics, I &s;hall at once drop the digre&s;&s;ion, and proceed.</P>
<P>Sir William's hou&s;e was an ancient Gothic &s;tructure, not rai&s;ed by lofty towers or tur|rets,
<PB N="2" REF="022876_0005_0FBA98E56052C7C0">
not the gaudy uplifted tin&s;elled fronts of modern piles, as the man&s;ions of many of our new created families of fa&s;hion are,&mdash; but in a more noble &s;tyle, tho' not overlook|ing the re&s;idence of humbler life, only in the front, an unob&s;tructed view of the &s;ea &s;hore for many miles, in &s;erene weather, might be enjoyed; adding an unlimited pro&s;pect of the &s;ea, which in a calm clear day was only to be lo&s;t in the &s;en&s;ible hori|zon of &s;ight, which of an evening at the &s;etting of the glorious luminary of light and heat, &s;eemed not only beautiful in the ex|treme, but an awful emblem of &s;olemn thought; for who could look on the unpa|ralleled colouring of the gla&s;&s;y deep, with|out contemplating on the Supreme Being, who out of nothing, &s;uch great and beauti|ful elements created?&mdash;Here it was that the worthy Baronet, at the clo&s;e of day, &s;pent many edifying and &s;atisfactory hours, where|by he dige&s;ted a happy theory into real practice;&mdash;con&s;idering wi&s;ely, for what end he was &s;ent into a probationary &s;tate as a free agent, whereby the choice of life or death were given.&mdash;Nor did the early dawn ri&s;e from her grey mottled pillow, without the Knight's vi&s;it to the &s;eat of his well earned wi&s;dom, for ere the golden mantle, embroidered with precious gems of the blu&s;hing morn was perceived, the pious man had invoked the protection and direc|tion of the Beneficent Being, to whom he
<PB N="3" REF="022876_0006_0FBA98E6E654FD00">
owed the whole of his happine&s;s and afflu|ence; &s;o that with the ri&s;ing Planet of Glo|ry, he was ready for an audience,&mdash;which was never refu&s;ed to the meane&s;t who &s;tood in need of his advice, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or relief: for his doors were open to his friends, ac|quaintance, the traveller, the indigent, or oppre&s;&s;ed. Thus was humanity made a regular and unerring &s;y&s;tem,&mdash;philo&s;ophy only refined the impre&s;&s;ions, &s;o that the beautiful &s;ublimity of Religion was the true fini&s;her of Sir William's works,&mdash;never daring to attempt any thing that would not admit the touch&s;tone of that exalted &s;tand|ard,&mdash;&s;he always being ranked the criterion of order.&mdash;So far let me &s;ketch the outlines of this truly good and worthy character;&mdash; for envy &s;hrunk at his pre&s;ence, nor dared calumny to &s;pread her baleful exhalations where his name was mentioned,&mdash;for Fame (for once) had &s;ounded with &s;olid grounds the worth of Howard's name&mdash;in proclaim|ing the daily exerci&s;e at Howard's Ca&s;tle, &s;uch being the name his man&s;ion bore.</P>
<P>Sir William's dome&s;tics were not nume|rous, having only tho&s;e who were fit to ex|ecute with faithfulne&s;s his daily commi&s;&s;ions; to di&s;tribute not only at Howard's Ca&s;tle, but al&s;o at the re&s;pective re&s;idence of the afflicted or di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, who had, by proper application, made known their ca&s;es,&mdash; therefore the profligate, the idler, and pro|fane were excluded. Three male &s;ervants,

with two females, compo&s;ed the whole of his family. His Lady, who had for many years &s;hared with him the ble&s;&s;ings of the poor, was &s;ome time &s;ince departed from a tran&s;itory &s;tate, to enjoy the everla&s;ting crown laid up for her, and all tho&s;e who piou&s;ly follow her in the paths of virtue and chri&s;tian piety. But ere they parted, had given repeated pledges of their love, which the Deity, for his wi&s;e ends, had as oft called hence to cele&s;tial happine&s;s; yet did not wholly decline the grant ardently wi&s;hed in their mutual prayers&mdash;for an heir was left to perpetuate the worthy name a&s;|&s;umed in that illu&s;trious family.&mdash;Henry was his name, who was now in habits of general cu&s;tom, making a grand tour of Europe, in order to fini&s;h an education which had been liberal indeed;&mdash;for early had his parents in&s;tilled the &s;eeds of virtue, morality, and religion into his mind, which was well capacitated to receive the impre&s;|&s;ions, being naturally &s;trong and very &s;u|&s;ceptible of implanting on a large &s;cale the greate&s;t depths of under&s;tanding; whereby expanded ideas could reach the greate&s;t heights, whil&s;t exten&s;ion was unlimited. Since this period, proper preceptors, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an univer&s;ity, had fini&s;hed what the Briti&s;h I&s;land could afford in the grand re&s;earches of knowledge, to be of real &s;ervice in the rugged road through life.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="022876_0008_0FBA98EBCDA12E78">Henry was now arrived at an age of man|hood, having attained his twenty-&s;econd year; for though his &s;tudies were partly fini&s;hed before that period, yet his father, wi&s;ely con&s;idering the danger of evil im|pre&s;&s;ions, and the con&s;equences of bad ex|amples&mdash;digre&s;&s;ionally made applications of all the various cour&s;es continental travellers or re&s;idents u&s;ually practi&s;ed, and the re&s;ult of corrupted minds, faithfully pourtraying the u&s;e that might be deduced from a know|ledge of men and manners in other coun|tries; at the &s;ame time, by an ea&s;y a&s;cent, mounting his ideas above the meridian of modern ta&s;te, &s;o far as the &s;lavi&s;h habits of imitation in dre&s;s, gambling, or exce&s;s in plea&s;ures of a &s;en&s;ual complexion;&mdash;wi&s;ely remarking to his &s;on, the many amateurs in &s;cience, and the few who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed real ta|lents which would argue the name of merit. Thus comparatively oppo&s;ing the advantages and di&s;advantages of the u&s;ual method of fini&s;hing a polite education in travelling&mdash; to &s;ee the manners and cu&s;toms of the mo&s;t enlightened and truly poli&s;hed courts of Europe,&mdash;a practice really worthy of con|tinuance, and of real utility to form the mind, &s;o far as liberality of &s;entiment, a re|gard to religion, a pure ta&s;te for improve|ment in arts and &s;ciences, with ob&s;ervations in the real practice of reading men, to be able to point out the general propen&s;ity, whether good or evil, of the various nations

when contra&s;ted, &s;o as to carry thither no prejudice, nor to bring from thence the lea&s;t colouring of a depraved ta&s;te; but to go out a man of caution, and return a man of experience; refined by a true notion of vir|tue, honor and liberality. Tho&s;e were the &s;hort contents of Sir William's repeated le&s;&s;ons to his &s;on, previous to his &s;etting out on his travels; which were li&s;tened to with dutiful attention, and carefully retain|ed for practical u&s;es.&mdash;Being thus provided with nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truction, a competent knowledge of the acqui&s;itions that he was to obtain, the dangers he was to avoid, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the coun&s;el and tuition of a re|&s;pectable gentleman in holy orders, as his preceptor, we &s;hall not he&s;itate to proclaim, that great were the expectations of Sir Wil|liam, from the con&s;equent poli&s;h his &s;on &s;hould acquire by two or three years re&s;i|dence on the continent.</P>
<P>Henry had now been ab&s;ent nearly three years, without any extraordinary occurrence, except his intelligence and de&s;cription of the &s;everal towns, cities, and countries he vi&s;ited, all of which were, with a preci&s;ion peculiar to him&s;elf, narrated with a &s;trict ad|herence to truth; yet in &s;o animated and cha&s;te a method, with an elegance of &s;tyle, that gave repetitions of plea&s;ure to Sir Wil|liam, to find his labour well be&s;towed in the cultivation of his &s;on's morals,&mdash;that a&s;&s;ured him alone, that he would be an or|nament
<PB N="7" REF="022876_0010_0FBA98EE53B12EF8">
to the &s;phere he was likely to re|volve in; as integrity of heart, u&s;ually termed (by the higher ranks of life) honor, was a principle, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed without a &s;pot or blemi&s;h by his &s;on, which Sir William carefully reminded him to regard as a jewel of ine&s;timable value.</P>
<P>The exigency of &s;tate was now on the eve of calling Sir William to attend his duty in Parliament, when Henry wrote to his father; he wi&s;hed to know his plea&s;ure relative to his return to England, expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to &s;ee him, and to receive further u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons in practical knowledge, hav|ing &s;een a &s;ufficiency of human life, few of the maxims whereof he cho&s;e to adopt, preferring the manly cu&s;toms and liberal &s;entiments of Britain, to all tho&s;e of the Continent. To this reque&s;t Sir William immediately attended, and in reply to his &s;on's letter gave him to under&s;tand, he &s;hould be glad of his return; as his inten|tions were to vacate his &s;eat in the Hou&s;e, wi&s;hing to decline in favour of him.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the period of this interval was pa&s;&s;ing over, Sir William amu&s;ed him&s;elf with the happine&s;s of &s;eeing his accompli&s;h|ed &s;on return in a few days.</P>
<P>One evening, in the month of September, nearly about the autumnal equinox, when the &s;un is &s;uppo&s;ed to enter the fir&s;t &s;cruple of Libra, or the Balance, which makes equal day and night in every quarter of the globe,

and con&s;equently ri&s;e &s;udden &s;qualls of wind, therefore a dangerous &s;ea&s;on for &s;hips in narrow &s;eas;&mdash;about the &s;etting of the &s;un, Sir William, from the leaden terrace of his man&s;ion, e&s;pied &s;omething of the appear|ance of a &s;ail, (a word u&s;ed as a &s;ea-phra&s;e on a &s;ight of a &s;hip at &s;ea) however the &s;udden change of the approaching night brought on an unu&s;ual darkne&s;s, accompa|nied with an awful &s;ky, overca&s;t with clouds of foreboding danger; the winds &s;ounded hollow, and &s;eemingly mourned the fate of victims decreed to an untimely vi&s;itation; whil&s;t the waves in &s;adne&s;s &s;eemed di&s;turbed by the gathering of vivid fla&s;hes of lightning, that &s;eemed al&s;o determined to be active in the approaching &s;cene.&mdash;Quickly the di&s;tant view of the ve&s;&s;el was interrupted; the face of nature &s;eemed all at once hid beneath the towering clouds, which like fleeces over|wrapt each other.&mdash;Now was Sir William's conjectures rou&s;ed; his mind was agitated exceedingly; in vain were his endeavours to calm the tumult of a&s;&s;embled pa&s;&s;ions; rea&s;on, fortitude, and all the auxiliary &s;o|lacing of re&s;ignation barely afforded relief, &s;o great was his anxiety;&mdash;for probability &s;eemed &s;o nearly allied to truth, that his powers were almo&s;t duped into a belief, that the &s;hip ju&s;t now in &s;ight, was freighted with the &s;afe conveyance of his &s;on and his at|tendants; here he immediately checked his groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="9" REF="022876_0012_0FBA98F3C37AF9D8">
ideas that cleared up the gloomine&s;s of his imagination.&mdash;"What," &s;aid he, "&s;hall I doubt of the providence of God, who&s;e hand has hitherto been &s;tretched forth to guard me from misfortunes? forbid it hea|ven!&mdash;but I am a &s;on of frailty, yet I hope my fall &s;hall be to ri&s;e again, therefore let the will of Heaven be fulfilled." A &s;hort ejaculatory prayer to the Divine Being clo&s;ed Sir William's &s;oliloquy. He then ha&s;ted from the terrace, the elements beginning their emulative &s;trife. Rain poured down in torrents,&mdash;lightning fla&s;hed in liquid &s;heets,&mdash;the winds howled in hoar&s;e bellow|ings, accompanied with dreadful claps of thunder:&mdash;thus a hurricane &s;et in.</P>
<P>Calmne&s;s neverthele&s;s &s;at now triumphant on Sir William's brow, though an innate principle of &s;omething more than ordinary, filled at intervals the &s;cope of his imagina|tion.</P>
<P>At an advanced hour of night, Sir Willi|am ordered his dome&s;tics to retire to re&s;t, yet from him &s;leep had fled; and &s;o much the ocean gained upon his thoughts, that he &s;at direct in view of the boi&s;terous ele|ment; carefully watching each &s;ucceeding wave that &s;urfed on the adjacent beach.&mdash; 'Twas now about the la&s;t hour of night, the clock having recently &s;truck twelve, the &s;ky &s;eemed more clear,&mdash;the &s;able face had part|ly di&s;appeared, though the winds were &s;till more &s;trong, and had &s;et to the &s;outh we&s;t

point,&mdash;a pale yellow had butted the ri&s;ing of the bla&s;t,&mdash;the &s;torm was completely &s;et; at this juncture the Knight perceived the ebbing &s;urf of more than common &s;ize had left behind &s;omething of the appearance of trunks or che&s;ts of baggage!&mdash;forthwith he rung his alarm bell, his &s;ervants in&s;tantly attended, but &s;carce were they collected, before a &s;econd appearance of a wreck was &s;een, from whence proceeded a lamentable cry of di&s;tre&s;s in the extreme.&mdash;This was more than Sir William's brea&s;t could &s;u|&s;tain,&mdash;he ru&s;hed forth in frantic &s;trides, beckoning the in&s;tant attendance of his do|me&s;tics, which was obeyed implicitly,&mdash;a few minutes opened the &s;cene, and revealed a &s;ight more than can be de&s;cribed in the &s;adne&s;s of repre&s;entation:&mdash;Several mangled bodies thrown from the wreck,&mdash;others in pitiable efforts endeavouring to e&s;cape, whil&s;t the yawning deep enveloped her prey!&mdash;In vain did the good Knight exert all his ability;&mdash;to conte&s;t with winds and waves was more than he dared, de&s;pair had invaded the thoughts of tho&s;e who were minded to give relief,&mdash;the &s;ight was too piercing a &s;pectacle, where no alleviation could take place,&mdash;the whole crew were &s;een to &s;ink beneath the briny &s;urface!&mdash;Here Sir William broke &s;ilence, "Alas! what avails our boa&s;ted &s;trength, our greate&s;t power, our mo&s;t u&s;eful faculties?&mdash;nothing! when Heaven's high will oppo&s;es our inten|tions
<PB N="11" REF="022876_0014_0FBA98F6CE52FA18">
&mdash;Though human creatures are in the greate&s;t need of timely aid at &s;ome few yards di&s;tance, yet we cannot afford the &s;malle&s;t relief."&mdash;Ju&s;t now &s;unk the la&s;t victim to the mercile&s;s waves!&mdash;"&s;ee the havock!&mdash;&s;ee the wretched appearance of lifele&s;s mortals! behold the mangled limbs of both &s;exes!&mdash;but &s;ee what this la&s;t ebb has left?&mdash;a woman's body!&mdash;yes!&mdash;no con|fu&s;ion,&mdash;perhaps not quite dead;&mdash;&s;he was the la&s;t the mighty flood was &s;atiated with,&mdash; hither bear the corps,&mdash;if returning life &s;hould animate the body, then are all our cares happily be&s;towed."</P>
<P>Thus ended the good man's reverie. &mdash;He ha&s;ted to his hou&s;e to admini&s;ter all that humanity could dictate, to recover the per&s;on whom his &s;ervants had conveyed thither; leaving an old man to watch what the &s;ea &s;hould ca&s;t up, and bring tidings if the ca&s;e required a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than an hour's application Sir Wil|liam's efforts were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash; reanimation &s;ucceeded the &s;eeming di&s;&s;olu|tion,&mdash;the delicate frame of a charming young lady began to exerci&s;e its wonted functions.&mdash;The worthy Baronet knelt down to pay the tribute of thanks and prai&s;e to God for ble&s;&s;ing his endeavours, and in|voked a continuance thereof. The young lady with a fervent piety, accompanied him, rendering thanks to Heaven, and pouring out a ble&s;&s;ing on her deliverer from the jaws
<PB N="12" REF="022876_0015_0FBA98F995EDEFF8">
of death; clo&s;ing her lips only through faintne&s;s. A cordial was admini&s;tered with effect,&mdash;&s;he became her&s;elf again,&mdash;health &s;eemed approaching; but re&s;t being deemed a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply, &s;he was left in the care of Sir William's hou&s;e-keeper, when &s;leep &s;eemed a welcome gue&s;t to her wearied &s;en&s;es,&mdash;&s;o in a profound &s;lumber &s;he re|po&s;ed on a warm bed, whil&s;t the Baronet withdrew with his a&s;&s;i&s;tants.</P>
<P>Meanwhile day approached. Sir Willi|am, anxious to know the per&s;on he had re&s;cued from death, as al&s;o the names and quality of tho&s;e who had peri&s;hed in the &s;torm, the &s;ea being now &s;ilenced by a dead calm, &s;tillne&s;s &s;eemed to be the reigning queen of the morn, whil&s;t he with his &s;er|vants carefully took up the bodies that re|mained on the piked rocks of the &s;hore; &s;hells were provided, and ten per&s;ons were coffined for interment, which with a &s;olemn ceremony was performed,&mdash;the worthy rector attending his duty with becoming re&s;pect, &s;etting forth to a crowded a&s;&s;emblage of neighbouring te|nants to the manor, the uncertainty of life,&mdash; the po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance of death,&mdash;the con&s;e|quences of &s;udden or unprovided death,&mdash; the nece&s;&s;ity of being always ready,&mdash;with a pathetic di&s;cour&s;e on the heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s of youth of both &s;exes, in regard to &s;eeking their Creator in the days of their youth, and the indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity for it, to en&s;ure a ble&s;&s;ing here, and a happy immortality here|after; with an allu&s;ion to the life pre&s;erv|ed,

&mdash;that an early piety was no doubt the cau&s;e of prolonging it; al&s;o in inveigh|ing much again&s;t the dete&s;table word of chance,&mdash;clearly proving, that without the guidance of the Cele&s;tial Power, nothing was certain; for though wickedne&s;s might for a time bear the appearance of pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, yet a certain fearful period of de&s;truction awaited the delinquent. The clergyman clo&s;ed his &s;ermon on the funeral of the drowned per&s;ons, with many &s;erious and practical admonitions, requi&s;itions, and reflections,&mdash;&s;o that out of the church-yard none departed without a tear of compunc|tion, and a firm re&s;olve to adhere to the words of their Pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>When the rites of the dead were ended, Sir William had the papers of the wreck examined, when it was found the &s;hip had cleared from New-York, in America, nine weeks before that period; that &s;he was call|ed the Si&s;ters, John Par&s;ons, Commander; was bound for London, laden with dry goods, and had on board &s;everal ladies and gentlemen as pa&s;&s;engers to England. The bad condition of the &s;hip's papers precluded a further information, and put Sir William under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity to enquire of the young lady the other particulars re|lative to the voyage, and the number and quality of the per&s;ons that were ca&s;t away; which, owing to the fatigue and delicacy of her con&s;titution, he was obliged to forego

<P>A few days elap&s;ed, during which time an unremitting attention was paid to the young lady's health, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h it, which with the care practi&s;ed, &s;oon accom|pli&s;hed; yet Sir William was cautious to enquire, le&s;t a relap&s;e &s;hould be the con&s;e|quence.&mdash;Whil&s;t he was ruminating on the late cata&s;trophe of the &s;hipwreck, the po&s;t brought him a letter, announcing the &s;afe arrival of his &s;on, in England, dated from Dover; that he &s;hould take in London in his route; and hoped to pay his duty in three days to his honored parent. This filled the good man with a ta&s;te of happi|ne&s;s he never knew before; it was now, and only at this in&s;tant, he owned his doubts and fears for the &s;afety of his &s;on. Although he betrayed no &s;ymptons of fear outwardly, yet a continual di&s;agreeable phantom of imagination haunted his mind, &s;tating a po&s;&s;ibility,&mdash;adding a probability of his &s;on being ca&s;t away in the late violent hur|ricane.

<P>The expected period of Henry's arrival being nearly advanced, the day being half &s;pent, the &s;un was declining from his meri|dional height, when Henrietta, for &s;o was &s;he called, a&s;ked the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her attend|ant to dre&s;s her&s;elf, fancying &s;he &s;hould be better by a jaunt in Sir William's coach, which the phy&s;ician that attended her great|ly enforced, though &s;trenuou&s;ly objected to by Sir William, fearing the &s;harpne&s;s of the air might be too much; however, by the Doctor's advice he was over-ruled. She therefore attired her&s;elf in an elegant &s;uit of &s;ilk, &s;uitable for the &s;ea&s;on, richly trim|med with &s;able, never having under&s;tood the fate of her relations; Sir William hav|ing con&s;tantly evaded any conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject, intending to open it by degrees, fearing the fatal effect &s;uch a narration as he mu&s;t relate, not knowing what affinity the decea&s;ed might have been to her; for her attendant con&s;tantly remarked, the whole &s;hip's freight, together with the &s;ea|men and pa&s;&s;engers, were all &s;aved.

Mi&s;s Colville and his father, and were &s;o agreeable, as to let the forenoon &s;teal away in&s;en&s;ibly, till dinner was on the table.&mdash; Thus did three days elap&s;e in the &s;ociety of three good per&s;ons, who&s;e minds were of the &s;ame contexture.&mdash;The fourth day, pretty early in the morning, a po&s;t chai&s;e and four hor&s;es &s;topt in the court yard, out of which Captain Colville and Lord Dacie &s;tept, who were immediately introduced to Sir William, Henry, and Mi&s;s Colville. The Captain thanked the Baronet for the care he had taken of his &s;i&s;ter, and related to them the manner of their e&s;cape from the dangers of the &s;ea. After a tender embrace of her brother, Mi&s;s Colville launched out into prai&s;es of the ho&s;pitality of Sir William and his &s;on, to which the Captain, in a hand&s;ome manner expre&s;&s;ed his obligations, as al&s;o tho&s;e of his family;&mdash;and gave Sir William to under&s;tand, that Lord Colville, his Lady, and a young female relation, would the next day arrive to pay their re&s;pects to him for the care he had taken of their daughter:&mdash; which intelligence gave great &s;atisfaction to Mi&s;s Colville, Sir William Howard, and his &s;on.

and returned;&mdash;&s;ilence reigned univer&s;al!&mdash; upon which, the Captain indi&s;creetly bur&s;t forth into an immoderate fit of laughter, &s;aying: "my Lord, you are foiled."&mdash; Lord Dacie replied, "I wonder at your ob|&s;ervation; do you think I rea&s;on with women?"&mdash;and walked to the window again in a pet.&mdash;Mi&s;s Colville was not at all di&s;|plea&s;ed, but with her u&s;ual good humoured a&s;pect, &s;aid:&mdash;"my Lord, our &s;ex thank you,&mdash;or in other words, I thank you in their name, for your refu&s;al to &s;peak rea&s;on|ably to any of us;&mdash;I hope your own &s;ex may not experience the &s;ame inconvenience."</P>
<P>Sir William Howard changed the &s;ubject, fearing an obloquy thrown out by any of the young per&s;ons might tend to a bad con&s;e|quence, well knowing, juvenile heat would &s;eldom avow, tho' indi&s;creetly depart from con&s;i&s;tency;&mdash;and in general terms, &s;aid, "I am certain we have all &s;een the Metro|politan cities of England and France, there|fore I &s;hould be glad of your &s;eparate opi|nions, whether we, or our neighbours, have gained the palm with re&s;pect to ta&s;te and refinement, in arts and &s;ciences; and which city can boa&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;uperb buildings, &s;quares, recreations, and outlets?"</P>
<P>To which Lord Dacie, in a ha&s;ty tone re|plied, "there is no compari&s;on;&mdash;except London bore an analogy, as a &s;hilling to a guinea, if compared with Paris;&mdash;for what &s;ignifies," continued he, "the amplitude of
<PB N="31" REF="022876_0034_0FBA991CDEA1D7B8">
that trading city, when the ta&s;te and elegance of Paris is mentioned?&mdash;Can we compare the choaked Thames with the grand river Seine,&mdash;who&s;e banks are not crowded with buildings to the water's edge, but a parade of near an hundred feet in breadth between the hou&s;es and the river?&mdash;the parapet wall being low, adds a grandeur to the river, that the muddy Thames cannot pre&s;ume to command.&mdash;If you look ea&s;tward towards the Pont Neuf, you have the whole range of the old and new Louvre on one &s;ide, and the Mazarin College on the other;&mdash;look down the river we&s;tward, the Thuilleries Gardens on one &s;ide, and the Palais de Bour|bon, with the grand Ho&s;pital on the other, are &s;uch views, that London has nothing to compare with them."</P>
<P>"I grant you," &s;aid Henry, "that tho&s;e views are very plea&s;ing; but your prejudice magnifies more than Newton's tele&s;cope, as London is at this time one of the fir&s;t cities in Europe, or I may &s;ay the world:&mdash;for tho' the buildings come clo&s;e to the water's edge, yet there is a convenience that re&s;ults there|from, which would not be equalled by rai|&s;ing a four foot wall to plea&s;e the eye of an idle &s;pectator.&mdash;Tho' we are not without views &s;uperior to tho&s;e you have mentioned; &mdash;for, look up from Black-Friar's Bridge, and you take five times the &s;cope you &s;eem to make the mo&s;t of.&mdash;In the fir&s;t place, the Thames is four times the width of the

<P>Mi&s;s Colville ob&s;erved, that both nations po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed greatne&s;s;&mdash;in her way of think|ing, France could &s;ay "Paris was great" but England could at the &s;ame time pro|claim, "London was greater."&mdash;Sir Wil|liam complimented her on her &s;agacity,&mdash; which clo&s;ed the conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>The captain gave Henry a friendly invi|tation to town, which he very politely decli|ned; alledging, he &s;hould not be able to do him&s;elf the honor.&mdash;The arrival of Lord and Lady Colville, with Mi&s;s Dampier, their niece was announced, which drew the attention of all parties.&mdash;Lady Colville, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, was agreeably &s;urpri|&s;ed, on &s;eeing her &s;uppo&s;ed lo&s;t child in Hen|rietta, not having &s;een her for nearly two years;&mdash;his Lord&s;hip, her father, al&s;o ten|derly embraced his daughter;&mdash;joy was dif|fu&s;ed on all &s;ides in the &s;ight of each other. &mdash;By this time Sir William Howard was re|lea&s;ed from his &s;uppliants, and was highly gratified with the interview; giving them joy in their child, and a hearty welcome to Howard's Ca&s;tle,&mdash;which was an&s;wered with grateful acknowledgments by Lord and Lady Colville.</P>
<P>The young lady who was come to &s;ee her cou&s;in Henrietta, with her uncle and aunt, was al&s;o a cou&s;in to Lord Dacie, being &s;i&s;ter's children; &s;o that a proximity of kindne&s;s pervaded the &s;trangers at Howard's Ca&s;tle.</P>

and fortune of his lord&s;hip." Sir William &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce, which clo&s;ed the &s;ub|ject, Lord Dacie entering the room.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Henry had the plea&s;ure of con|ver&s;ing with the ladies, who were mutually one and all charmed with his conver&s;ation, his vivacity and good humour being proper|ties not to be equalled; &mdash;adding, to an ele|gance of per&s;on &s;carcely to be met with, an air and deportment manly and noble.</P>
<P>Both Henry and Henrietta knowing the intentions of Lord Colville, though &s;uppo&s;ing each other &s;trangers to them, it drew their eyes &s;o forcibly, that they often met,&mdash;and darts of unutterable angui&s;h pierced their hearts; &s;o that repeated &s;ighs were heaved involuntarily, which gave the quick-&s;ighted Charlotte &s;ome idea of the &s;ymptoms.&mdash;But &s;he dared not utter a groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picion, until more corroborating circum&s;tances oc|curred to en&s;ure her of the orthodox of her belief.</P>
<P>The gentlemen now mixed company, and Henry received a rallying on his effeminan|cy, to prefer tea before wine.&mdash;Here he had the advantage, by making a confe&s;&s;ion, "that ladies were of that attaching quality, that a permi&s;&s;ion to be in their company without refre&s;hments, was &s;uperior to any repa&s;t in the company of his own &s;ex."&mdash; For this compliment Lady Colville thanked him, and jollity &s;eemed to pervade the whole evening.</P>

<P>Sir William Howard acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well in the e&s;timation of his vi&s;itants, that all were happy, except the exceptionable per&s;on ju&s;t now mentioned, who &s;uffered in the extreme to find every per&s;on attached to Henry; who, (by Sir William's inadver|tency it came out,) would, on his demi&s;e, be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum.&mdash;Al&s;o had in expectancy an income of an equal &s;um, with a Ducal Co|ronet annexed. Yet neverthele&s;s, Henry's manner was meekne&s;s, added to a becoming cheerfulne&s;s, that made him the object of univer&s;al admiration.</P>
<P>The rumour of the extraordinary circum|&s;tance of the &s;hipwreck, by this time had found its way into all the news-papers throughout the kingdom,&mdash;therefore drew &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank to en|quire into the truth of the matter.&mdash; The Duke of King&s;borough, accompanied

by the Marquis of Languedoc, his Lady, and their beautiful daughter, were curious enough to take a trip to Howard's Ca&s;tle,&mdash; at which &s;eat they arrived the morning that Lord Colville and his company intended &s;et|ting out for London.&mdash;The arrival of tho&s;e noble per&s;onages retarded their journey, as the Duke of King&s;borough and Lord Colville were intimately acquainted.&mdash;Sir William Howard &s;atisfactorily gave a detail of the ca|ta&s;trophe, upon which it was determined Lord Colville &s;hould &s;tay a few days longer.</P>
<P>His Grace of King&s;borough was happy in conver&s;ing with Henry Howard, who was his nephew and heir apparent, which, when Lord Colville under&s;tood, he was &s;orry he had engaged with the Duke of A&s;hbridge, Lord Dacie's father,&mdash;but as a man of honor he took no &s;teps to retract.</P>
<P>The reader may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that in &s;o polite an a&s;&s;emblage of notables, every &s;pecies of recreation the country afford|ed was enjoyed;&mdash;a grand fete was given, but the &s;ea&s;on was rather too far advanced. &mdash;The ball room was fini&s;hed in the highe&s;t ta&s;te, by the exertions of the ladies and gentlemen.&mdash;Lady Olivia, the Marquis of Languedoc's daughter, was Henry's partner; &s;he was a per&s;on of great &s;kill in the lively &s;cenes of fe&s;tivity, &s;o that the&s;e two bore the laurel of the evening, as well as the &s;way of the morning.

Noon &s;ummoned the fatigued partakers of plea&s;ure to the breakfa&s;t room, every eye &s;parkled with plea&s;ure,&mdash;nothing impeded the gene|ral &s;atisfaction that was diffu&s;ed throughout the per&s;ons that compo&s;ed this polite circle, &mdash;for Dacie had nipped in the bud the &s;prouts of jealou&s;y, that &s;u&s;picion had in a fit of malig|nant &s;port dropt in his bo&s;om.

<P>All the nobility and gentry having taken an affectionate leave of Sir William and his &s;on, they were at lei&s;ure to concert what was nece&s;&s;ary to be done. Sir William having vacated his &s;eat, and a writ being i&s;&s;ued, Henry was elected without oppo&s;ition; there|fore mu&s;t needs attend parliament after the Chri&s;tmas rece&s;s. Sir William gave his &s;on &s;everal political le&s;&s;ons,&mdash;to which he faith|fully promi&s;ed to concede in every matter he &s;hould be concerned in. The holidays being over, nothing material occurred. Henry took his leave of Sir William to give his maiden &s;peech in the &s;enate, which was on a que&s;tion of national importance; on which he was loudly applauded in the hou&s;e, and his &s;peech publi&s;hed at full length in the news-papers. Sir William was not a little gratified in the difference of the mode&s;t account given by Henry in his letter, and of
<PB N="43" REF="022876_0046_0FBA9937D54530C0">
tho&s;e in the news-papers announced of his talents. A few days attendance on the duties of the &s;enate, gave Henry a popular name;&mdash;yet he was not intoxicated with the plaudits of the multitude;&mdash;wi&s;ely reflect|ing, the luculent &s;pring was by a &s;ingle drop made lutulent,&mdash;therefore he mode&s;tly refu&s;ed all panegyric on his abilities which periodical writers held out.</P>
<P>About this time Captain Colville gave him an invitation to Colville-Hou&s;e, which was within a few &s;treets of Henry's dwelling; his re&s;idence being at his uncle's hou&s;e, the Duke of King&s;borough, Sir William having had no town hou&s;e for &s;ome years. Henry accepted of his friend's invitation, for he &s;till had a wi&s;h to &s;ee Henrietta, although he concluded &s;he was to be the wife of Dacie. &mdash;Yet it gave him a kind of plea&s;ure that re&s;ults from the purity of mental faculties; as he wi&s;hed for the happine&s;s of the per&s;on who made the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of a tactile nature, which &s;hould now only bear the ap|pellation of friend&s;hip, yet required a pandect of the &s;ofte&s;t pa&s;&s;ion to eradicate it.</P>
<P>But as before remarked, Henry had a perfect ma&s;tery over his pa&s;&s;ions, therefore latitudinariani&s;m was a cour&s;e he abhor|red;&mdash;&s;o that he went with plea&s;ure to &s;ee his friends.&mdash;He received compliments from Lord and Lady Colville, General Moun&s;ey and his Lady, Mi&s;s Dampier, and &s;everal others, but was &s;urprized he did not

<P>Until this in&s;tant Henry was never at a a lo&s;s for recollection,&mdash;but the frailty of human nature, often, in a conflict with rea|&s;on, is more than a conqueror, for every per&s;on pre&s;ent ob&s;erved the di&s;order of the minute, and was que&s;tioned as to the cau&s;e of his &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition, which he hap|pily overcame in a &s;hort time; giving out, that a dizzine&s;s, to which he was often &s;ub|ject, was the cau&s;e, though he was then under pre&s;cription for it, which he hoped would prove a panacea.&mdash;This pa&s;&s;ed very well of all pre&s;ent, except Charlotte Dam|pier, who had other motives to germinate her &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>The day pa&s;&s;ed extremely well,&mdash;the Ge|neral wi&s;hed to cultivate an acquaintance with Henry, and a future day was appointed at his hou&s;e for the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing each other.&mdash;Mi&s;s Dampier, in &s;pite of her coquetting, found her heart was not free,&mdash; that Henry had tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed innocently;&mdash;this was done without his knowledge, therefore we &s;hall exculpate him.&mdash;No method pre|&s;ented, as practicable to the wounded fair, to lay the &s;tate of her grievances before her paramour, at length a letter was con&s;idered the be&s;t intelligencer;&mdash;for oft times literal

<P>Henry was a&s;toni&s;hed at the billet-doux of Charlotte,&mdash;being unable to form a conjecture that would carry a feazability in what &s;he meant, whether je&s;t or earne&s;t; but in compliance with the rules of decorum, he &s;ent an an&s;wer, in which an explanation was required. The giddy fair-one judged the requi&s;ition was be&s;t, if an opportunity &s;erved, to deliver it orally&mdash;which was done by her calling on Henry at his apartments in his uncle's hou&s;e. It was very di&s;agree|ble to Henry, to receive a lady into the hou&s;e, without the knowledge of his uncle, and to deny her an audience, after admi&s;|&s;ion, would be likewi&s;e a &s;till more irk&s;ome ta&s;k to a per&s;on of his feelings;&mdash;for he found him&s;elf con&s;iderably agitated by the imprudence of his vi&s;itant:&mdash;as, in females, nothing can argue a greater &s;hare of indi&s;|cretion, than to degrade them&s;elves by acting ma&s;culine characters, to pay tho&s;e vi&s;its that &s;hould be paid to them; there|fore, let ladies of prudence and virtue have that coercive principle, to avoid &s;uch unbecoming &s;teps towards levity.</P>

wi&s;dom Henry po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was un&s;haken. No advantages were pre&s;umed, and much le&s;s taken, although a breach of the laws of prudence might have been otherwi&s;e handled by many of our depraved pragmatic heroes of modern ta&s;te. Here the &s;cale was balanced. Mi&s;s Dampier took her leave, though un&s;atisfied as to Henry's frankne&s;s,&mdash; for though he alledged he was not pre|engaged, nor yet aver&s;e to the happine&s;s of a connubial &s;tate, he pleaded for time to con&s;ider,&mdash;never offering to ki&s;s her lips;&mdash; a plea&s;ure &s;he hoped to enjoy. But &s;uch inflammatory incitements, often tend to the wor&s;t con&s;equences;&mdash;a practice though fa&s;hionable, yet

for ladies who wi&s;h to reap the advantages of this life, and that to come, &s;hould conduct them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t caution; and doubt every thing that carries an appearance of danger with it. But the lady in que&s;tion did not po&s;&s;e&s;s the nece&s;&s;ary ingredients to avoid an imputation of cen&s;ure, which is a &s;tain to the character of a virtuous woman, not ea&s;ily effaced, and often terminates in a flaw through life. Thus the enamorata retired from an un&s;atisfactory interview.&mdash; However an emi&s;&s;ary was &s;ent the next morning with an elucidation, &s;etting forth, her &s;u&s;picions of his attachment to her cou|&s;in, Mi&s;s Colville, with a recital of what he already knew,&mdash;the intentions of the pa|rents

<P>This &s;ingular circum&s;tance nearly de|prived Henry of his vivacity;&mdash;however, a re&s;pite was granted until the appointment at General Moun&s;ey's took place; a day of much bu&s;ine&s;s, as intended by Mi&s;s Dam|pier. The day arrived which brought with it all the gaiety and &s;plendour of the town; it was that appointed for celebrating her Maje&s;ty's birth day; therefore, the notables throughout the Metropolis, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pay|ing their compliments to &s;o amiable a pair as the nation is ble&s;&s;ed with;&mdash;for the ex|ample given by the Royal Per&s;onages, is not to be equalled; and ju&s;tly merits the approbation and admiration of every liberal minded per&s;on throughout Europe.</P>

<P>Nothing further pa&s;&s;ed, Lord Dacie join|ing the company; being extremely fond of his intended bride, and tenacious to &s;ecure her per&s;on. The a&s;&s;embly having broke up about three o'clock in the morning, the whole company who had left the General's hou&s;e returned thither; not one, even among&s;t the &s;eniors, complaining of the want of re&s;t, as all wi&s;hed to <HI>&s;uivez rai&s;on,</HI> &s;o far as they might &s;ay, <HI>Loyal je &s;erai du|rant ma vie bon vouloir &s;ervir le maje&s;t&eacute;,</HI> &s;o kept the night in honor of the day, and the &s;ucceeding day in honor of the night, to make for once an excu&s;e <HI>loyalt&eacute; me oblige.</HI>&mdash; Here it might be excu&s;able for <HI>once,</HI> but never &s;hould be repeated; as human nature will not admit of a repetition of &s;uch recre|ations as would prevent a nece&s;&s;ary recruit of tho&s;e animal &s;pirits which are di&s;per&s;ed by the exertion of our faculties; for were ladies to endeavour to acquire a knowledge of philo&s;ophy, in&s;tead of &s;pending their time in learning u&s;ele&s;s foreign languages, they would thereby enlarge their faculties, and gain, if not a precedence to, at lea&s;t

<P>It is now time to inform our readers, that all the company went from General Moun|&s;ey's, except Mi&s;s Colville and Henry Howard, who, through the per&s;ua&s;ion of the General took a morning's nap. The afternoon furni&s;hed the tea-table. The General and Mrs. Moun&s;ey were highly taken with Henry, often wi&s;hing, that an union between him and Henrietta had taken place;&mdash;but as nothing in an honorable manner could for the pre&s;ent occur, all thoughts of it were laid a&s;ide; yet with a &s;ecret re&s;olve on the part of the General, to bring it about if po&s;&s;ible, notwith&s;tand|ing

the ob&s;tinate temper of his father-in-law.&mdash;Henry and Mi&s;s Colville &s;pent the day together with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction; their di&s;po&s;itions being &s;o &s;imilar, that it might be &s;aid they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but one mind.&mdash; The General pre&s;&s;ed Henry to make one at a card party that evening, with which he reluctantly complied, fearing his pre&s;ence might create groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions to the prejudice of Mi&s;s Colville's character; well knowing, Mi&s;s Dampier would make a handle of the lea&s;t appearance whereby &s;he could rai&s;e the anger of Lord Dacie; and by di&s;turbing the tranquillity of the two families, con&s;equently di&s;able Henry from having an opportunity of conver&s;ing with Mi&s;s Colville. Henrietta let Mrs. Moun|&s;ey into the &s;ecret of Mi&s;s Dampier's attack on Henry, which created a good deal of mirth between the Ladies. The General and Henry were both pre&s;&s;ing to know the &s;ecret, which Mi&s;s Colville &s;trenuou&s;ly op|po&s;ed;&mdash;however, by the General's &s;olicita|tion, Mrs. Moun&s;ey con&s;ented to relate it, if Henry gave permi&s;&s;ion. This reque&s;t he did not he&s;itate to comply with, yet accu&s;ed him&s;elf of remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, on hearing Mi&s;s Dampier's affair was the cau&s;e of the Ladies &s;port,&mdash;as it was really imprudent in Henry to divulge it, without the &s;tricte&s;t injunction to keep it inviolably a &s;ecret;&mdash;but he left no re&s;traint on Mi&s;s Colville in that re&s;pect, therefore he could only blame him&s;elf.&mdash;
<PB N="52" REF="022876_0055_0FBA994B15CFFC00">
The General was very merry on the intelli|gence given, and in a friendly manner cau|tioned Henry again&s;t the arts that might be practi&s;ed by Mi&s;s Dampier, in which he was joined by Mrs. Moun&s;ey. Mi&s;s Colville &s;aid but little, only remarked it was too forward for a lady.&mdash;Company increa&s;ed,&mdash;Captain Colville being of the party, the evening pa&s;&s;ed very agreeably;&mdash;it was near ten o'clock at night, when Mi&s;s Dampier enter|ed the room; her relations were at a lo&s;s to conjecture what could have brought her thither at that hour.&mdash;But the facetious General enquired into the &s;tate of her mind, which the love-&s;ick lady reli&s;hed but indifferently; apologized for her interrupt|ing &s;uch good company; and &s;aid, &s;he came thither at that hour on bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome im|portance to her cou&s;in&punc; Lord Dacie, whom &s;he thought to have found there.</P>
<P>Henry felt him&s;elf unea&s;y at the &s;ight of that lady, as did Mi&s;s Colville, neither of whom had the pre&s;ence of mind to &s;peak to Mi&s;s Dampier, who, with a malicious &s;mile &s;aid, "&s;o, lady and gentleman, you are both too well employed to &s;peak," and then, like a bow-&s;hot di&s;appeared. We may naturally &s;uppo&s;e they were both hurt very much by that lady's odd manner of &s;alutation, yet were at a lo&s;s to account for &s;uch conduct. &mdash;The General, by a plea&s;ant joke, gave Henry, in a low voice, the &s;ub&s;tance of his thoughts re&s;pecting the &s;trange vi&s;it ju&s;t now

paid by Mi&s;s Dampier, in which he coincid|ed. The company &s;oon after broke up, when no per&s;ua&s;ion could avail, for Henry was re&s;olved on going to his uncle's.&mdash;On his leaving the General's hou&s;e, Capt. Colville accompanied him, and informed him, that on his coming to his brother's, he had &s;een Lord Dacie and Mi&s;s Dampier &s;tanding at the entrance of an avenue, in conver&s;ation with Betty, his &s;i&s;ter Henrietta's waiting-maid; but on his approach they di&s;appear|ed.&mdash;Henry found there was &s;omething in preparation which he judged was not ground|ed on honorable principles,&mdash;however, he tru&s;ted to the method he had hitherto inva|riably practi&s;ed, to acquit him&s;elf with ho|nor again&s;t the united forces of calumny and perfidy; the only productions the ma|chinations of evil-minded per&s;ons can be|get.&mdash;The Captain took his leave with a de&s;ign to give him a meeting in the morning at breakfa&s;t.&mdash;Henry retired to re&s;t, &s;trange|ly affected by the unaccountable appearan|ces of the evening; ca&s;ting up the mo&s;t that could be made of them, he found he had nothing to fear from the lady or gentle|man in que&s;tion;&mdash;rightly judging, Mi&s;s Colville's maid-&s;ervant acted as an emi&s;&s;ary; therefore to inform Henrietta mu&s;t be at|tended to in the morning.&mdash;At an early hour Henry's &s;ervant carried a letter to Mi&s;s Col|ville, warning her again&s;t a breach of her &s;ervant's tru&s;t.&mdash;An an&s;wer was received by

Henry, acknowledging the obligation for his care, at the &s;ame time informing him, that her brother, on his parting with him the preceding night, had told her what he had &s;een,&mdash;upon which Betty made a con|fe&s;&s;ion, that by a gift of a few guineas, Lord Dacie and Mi&s;s Dampier had prevail|ed on her to watch the conduct of Mr. How|ard and Mi&s;s Colville,&mdash;for what rea&s;on &s;he did not know,&mdash;but believed Lord Dacie would do Mr. Howard all the injury in his power.</P>
<P>Upon reading the contents, Mr. Howard could not readily account for all the &s;cenes of the piece in rehear&s;al. Pre&s;ently Capt. Colville called agreeable to his promi&s;e. After breakfa&s;t they went together to pay a morn|ing's vi&s;it to General Moun&s;ey and the ladies. Lord Dacie was beforehand with them, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed to &s;ee Mr. Howard, and gave him an invitation to A&s;hbridge, which Mr. Howard declined in the mo&s;t polite man|ner, but his Lord&s;hip would take no denial, &s;o Mr. Howard, after &s;everal importunities con&s;ented, being &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;eeming friend&s;hip of Dacie; but with prudence re|&s;olved to guard again&s;t every advantage. Captain Colville, and the ladies, were be|yond de&s;cription perplexed to account for Lord Dacie's great good-nature to Mr. How|ard,&mdash;as Mi&s;s Colville ob&s;erved, from the beginning of their acquaintance, what a di&s;like Dacie &s;eemed to have to Mr. Howard;
<PB N="55" REF="022876_0058_0FBA99501F8B8408">
but the General entering the room almo&s;t at that in&s;tant, Lord Dacie al&s;o a&s;ked him to favour him with his company at A&s;hbridge, to which he readily con&s;ented, and enquired who were the others that were to compo&s;e the party? to this Dacie, in a vague man|ner &s;aid, a few &s;elect friends.&mdash;The Gene|ral, in his u&s;ual vein of humour, replied, perhaps enemies; Dacie &s;eemed hurt at his joke. Here the &s;ubject concluded, and Lord Dacie, wi&s;hing a good morning, de|parted.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard had none pre&s;ent but his friends, for the Captain had wholly for&s;aken his intended relation Lord Dacie, and was clo&s;ely attached to the intere&s;t of Mr. How|ard.&mdash;Of the re&s;t, Henry had every a&s;&s;ur|ance of friend&s;hip.&mdash;The national concerns required Mr. Howard's attendance in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and he, of cour&s;e, took an early leave; Mi&s;s Colville was un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of attending her mother, who was indi&s;po&s;ed;&mdash;the Captain bearing her company, the General and his lady were left alone. In the evening Mi&s;s Dampier paid them a vi&s;it in &s;eeming good &s;pirits, and made kind enquiries for Mr. Howard, who, &s;he &s;aid, was a gentleman of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed abilities; to this Mrs. Moun&s;ey made no reply, the General withdrawing previous to her <HI>entr&eacute;e.</HI>&mdash;"But," continued Mi&s;s Dampier, "is it not provoking, that "my cou&s;in Henrietta will at all times con|duct

her&s;elf &s;o imprudently, as to &s;hun Lord Dacie's company, if Mr. Howard's can be re&s;orted to?&mdash;this is not becoming, notwith&s;tanding all her boa&s;ted religion."&mdash; "Pray, Madam," replied Mrs. Moun&s;ey, "do not give your&s;elf the liberty to a&s;per&s;e an ab&s;ent character, e&s;pecially one who is unde&s;erving of the venom you would wil|lingly di&s;charge; I beg you will not cen&s;ure my &s;i&s;ter."&mdash;The&s;e words rou&s;ed the fiery di&s;po&s;ition of Charlotte; &s;he, in an elevated tone rejoined, by a&s;king Mrs. Moun&s;ey if &s;he could deny what &s;he had a&s;&s;erted? if not, then Mrs. Moun&s;ey was equally culpa|ble, to connive at &s;uch duplicity.</P>
<P>Mrs. Moun&s;ey took little notice of her invective, but intreated her to choo&s;e &s;ome other time, when the per&s;on whom &s;he in|veighed again&s;t might be pre&s;ent; to the&s;e words Charlotte made no reply, but ha&s;tily withdrew, &s;ounding the door as &s;he went out, &s;ignifying thereby the humour &s;he was in.</P>
<P>No change in the condition of affairs took place for &s;ome days.&mdash;Mr. Howard, in com|pany with General Moun&s;ey and Capt.

<P>Lord Colville would have willingly broke off the contract, but Lord Dacie and his father per&s;i&s;ted in having the engagement fulfilled; for the marriage articles between Lord Dacie and Mi&s;s Colville were pre|pared;&mdash;a bond, with a condition thereunto written, having been already executed be|tween Lord Colville and the Duke of A&s;hbridge, &s;ubjecting either party to a

<P>Mr. Howard received a &s;ort of &s;atisfac|tion on reading Dacie's letter; his conce&s;|&s;ion &s;howing a compunction that re&s;ulted from a &s;en&s;e of his crimes, and the mi&s;era|ble &s;tate his wickedne&s;s had plunged him in|to.&mdash;Though his method to conciliate bore a likene&s;s to artifice, yet as there was nothing to accrue from duplicity in his con|fe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="76" REF="022876_0079_0FBA9979D744E0F0">
Mr. Howard readily gave him what credit, his returning to an orderly habit could claim as its right;&mdash;for minds, habi|tuated to the &s;incere te&s;t of regulated truth, are apt to adopt the &s;teps prodigality a&s;|&s;umes, as though there was merit in acting on principles of integrity.&mdash;However, li|berality of &s;entiment is &s;o prai&s;e-worthy, that it only errs in doing good to all, with|out examining their preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>During the &s;ea&s;on Mr. Howard was at Spa, nothing was going forward that me|rited recording, &s;aving what follows: Cap|tain Colville was reduced to the penny-po&s;t for all his happine&s;s,&mdash;(Lord Colville hav|ing de&s;ired him, on pain of di&s;plea&s;ure, to di&s;continue his vi&s;its to A&s;hbridge, or its environs) but love often leads children into di&s;obedience, which in Lady Ann Cate&s;by and Captain Colville was in&s;tanced; and if po&s;&s;ible for degrees of compari&s;on, to aug|ment their affection&mdash;fervour and ardency, were the words of their motto.&mdash;A new character mu&s;t now be introduced.&mdash;A Mr. Ward, the younger &s;on of a nobleman, who had ju&s;t taken upon him &s;acred orders of the church, made his appearance, with &s;ome friends, on a vi&s;it to the Marquis of Lan|guedock.&mdash;Lady Olivia Beaumont found &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible attraction in the ca&s;&s;ock'd hero, that love's toil was begun.&mdash;The out|lines of this honorable and reverend cha|racter were &s;uitable to his function;&mdash;he

was young, and in the &s;tyle of manhood, very hand&s;ome; a &s;anguine complexion, piercing black eyes, delectable in a&s;pect, tall and genteel, his delivery the very e&s;&s;ence of eloquence; whence the reader may con|ceive, he was very &s;oon a popular preacher, and did honor to his cloth, by his words and works&mdash;which, by the bye, is a good le&s;&s;on for his brethren of the gown, for many preach one doctrine and practice another;&mdash; this is a glaring error, the notoriety of the fact, many experienced readers will, no doubt admit.</P>
<P>This gentleman was a cou&s;in-german to General Moun&s;ey, who was ever an advo|cate in the cau&s;e of honor; &s;o that Mr. Ward had in him a friend, and a relation of a fixed &s;tandard; yet of &s;o great a deli|cacy was this bu&s;ine&s;s, that a di&s;parity in fortune made his preten&s;ions to partake, of a precarious &s;tate, for the gown and his family allotment were but barely &s;ix hundred pound; a year, which with Lady Olivia's ten-thou|&s;and pounds per annum on the demi&s;e of the Marquis, her father, had but a light &s;ound: but love levels all di&s;tinctions, for Mr. Ward and Lady Olivia commenced and continued the proce&s;s of the Paphian God, with truth and &s;incerity.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter had a proper effect on the drooping &s;pirits of Mi&s;s Colville;&mdash;&s;he returned her an&s;wer, giving potent rea&s;ons for neglecting to mention the reverend cha|racter alluded to; however, as Moun&s;ey-Park, in Berk&s;hire, was the <HI>now</HI> almo&s;t con|&s;tant re&s;idence of General Moun&s;ey and his Lady, Henrietta was only accommodated with occa&s;ional vi&s;its from Lady Olivia Beaumont; for the hurry of bu&s;tling &s;trife had pa&s;&s;ed to the goal of re&s;t; every thing &s;lumbered into ea&s;y and natural interregnum of &s;ilence. The months &s;lipt in&s;en&s;ibly to

the ultimate, upon which Henry was to re|turn to his native i&s;le; and of cour&s;e was expected with joy by all tho&s;e who had the the plea&s;ure of Mr. Howard's acquaintance. As for Mi&s;s Dampier, &s;he &s;pent her &s;olitary hours at A&s;hbridge, Lady Colville having forbid her to vi&s;it at Colville-Hou&s;e, ever &s;ince the fever had left her,&mdash;accounting her of too dangerous a di&s;po&s;ition to a&s;&s;ociate with her daughters. Sir James Dampier and his lady were expected to arrive in England in a few months, having re&s;ided in the ex|alted &s;phere of the repre&s;entation of Maje&s;ty at one of the Barbarian courts of Africa;&mdash; and to the be&s;t of my recollection, at the imperial court of Morocco. Sir James was a plain hone&s;t man,&mdash;his lady haughty and impatient; and what was the wor&s;t in her compo&s;ition, <HI>Pride</HI> was a <HI>load</HI> under which &s;he could hardly &s;upport her&s;elf;&mdash; a burthen that has ruined the happine&s;s of many of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>In the latter end of September, Mr. How|ard's time to return was expired, which gave Mi&s;s Colville the very appearance of con|tent her&s;elf.&mdash;She indulged her&s;elf with a walk, in company with Lady Olivia Beau|mont, to the Park, and in a promi&s;cuous manner they met with Captain Colville, her brother, accompanied by two other officers of his regiment, a Captain Stewart, and a Lieutenant Pear&s;on, (both of whom had
<PB N="82" REF="022876_0085_0FBA9985EF483B98">
lately purcha&s;ed their commi&s;&s;ions) who were very uncouth to ladies of &s;uch elevat|ed rank, which Captain Colville took ami&s;s, repeatedly informing them, that one lady was his &s;i&s;ter, and the other a lady of di&s;tinc|tion, who paid her a vi&s;it.&mdash;However, his words were as idle dreams to tho&s;e &s;ons of Mars, imagining they were two courtezans, well known to Captain Colville, although in the conduct or appearance of the ladies nothing be&s;poke &s;uch characters; but &s;ome of the fops of fa&s;hion, when a cockade is pre&s;ented in their hats, &s;uppo&s;e they are at liberty to in&s;ult every fine woman they meet with.</P>
<P>The di&s;turbance created on the Mall, (as the valiant Colville had given repeated proofs of his courage in three &s;everal battles, whil&s;t Stewart and Pear&s;on had never un|&s;heathed their &s;words, except at a challenge of a puppy, or an incen&s;ed gander, or &s;uch like animals) brought together a crowd, in which number of curious per&s;ons, the Rev. Mr. Ward was included.&mdash;He readily re|cognized the ladies, and immediately e&s;pou|&s;ed their cau&s;e;&mdash;and in a commanding, &s;harp, and manly tone, de&s;ired the heroes of the &s;word to withdraw; which, to proceed from a me&s;&s;enger of peace, did not come in a palatable manner to be reli&s;hed by &s;uch proud &s;tomachs:&mdash;the con&s;equence was, Captain Stewart, as a qualified blood, drew his &s;word on the unarmed clergyman, who,
<PB N="83" REF="022876_0086_0FBA9987555FB1E8">
by the help of a cane, parried off the lunge, and in&s;tantly di&s;armed him, to the &s;urpri&s;e and applau&s;e of all the &s;pectators pre&s;ent; and then with the cane gave him his dever&s;|ed di&s;cipline&mdash;Meanwhile Captain Colville rattanned Pear&s;on very &s;everely, who dur&s;t not draw upon a man of &s;uch courage and &s;kill as he knew the Captain to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.&mdash;Words can &s;carcely convey the fright and agony &s;uch a rencontre naturally threw &s;uch timid innocent ladies into;&mdash;their &s;hrieks and cries prevented Mr. Ward from exacting penance from Captain Stewart, which he otherwi&s;e would have done.&mdash;A conveyance was immediately procured, and the ladies were attended home with &s;afety by Captain Colville and Mr. Ward.</P>
<P>This &s;ingular circum&s;tance had great in|fluence with the Marquis and Marchione&s;s of Languedock, who, on the occa&s;ion reque&s;t|ed the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing tho&s;e gentlemen at Pelham-Hou&s;e; this was a favourable op|portunity, and the worthies of the day, Moun&s;ey and Colville were not unmindful of their friend; for Mr. Ward was compli|mented by all pre&s;ent as a man of honor and a man of re&s;olution, when nece&s;&s;ity called for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of true courage, in a ca&s;e of emergency.&mdash;The noble parents of Olivia were charmed with his conver&s;ation, for he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the requi&s;ites that com|po&s;e the man in a &s;piritual and temporal &s;en&s;e;&mdash;Calumny never could point a dart&punc;

nor Envy exhale a breath, that had, or could &s;ully his fame.&mdash;Mild benevolence &s;at &s;miling in his road, for this &s;on of the church was what her children &s;hould be in manners and morals.&mdash;Yet, notwith&s;tand|ing his merit, the fickle godde&s;s had denied him her boon, therefore little could de&s;ert claim, more than repeated thanks, prai&s;es, and promi&s;es of friend&s;hip.&mdash;Here the reader may remark, that this introduction was an inlet to a future familiar intercour&s;e; for though Mr. Ward had vi&s;ited at Pelham-Hou&s;e once before this period, yet he was partly a &s;tranger to the noble proprietors.</P>
<P>Mr. Ward having done &s;uch wonders in the Park, his fame extended to all quarters of the towns;&mdash;the rude &s;ons of war were derided by every di&s;cerning per&s;on, and heartily laughed at in their own corps;&mdash; to &s;how the world the te&s;t of their courage, was a thing &s;o horrid in the ideas of tho&s;e &s;queami&s;h heroes, that they gave up every preten&s;ion to it.&mdash;But &s;ome arch wags, who had an a&s;cendancy over Captain Stewart, advi&s;ed him to vindicate his honor, by &s;end|ing a challenge to the gown&s;man who had &s;o &s;hamefully treated him; alledging that he would certainly decline oppo&s;ing his per&s;on to the danger of powder and ball; and that by this means he would wipe away the im|puted &s;candal of pu&s;illanimity.

to the contemplation of their friend's &s;ituation, as in fact it really proved to be a dangerous one:&mdash;whil&s;t we ob&s;erve to the reader, the turn of affairs at the metropolis of France.</P>
<P>Lord Dacie, we have already noticed, kept up a continued corre&s;pondence with Mr. Howard, therefore knew the time he had propo&s;ed to return to the land of liberty, and had re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to give him a friendly meeting in London, for which pur|po&s;e he prepared his baggage for removal; but had, on the evening preceding his in|tended route, a curio&s;ity to &s;ee the entertain|ment exhibited by royal appointment in the gardens of Ver&s;ailles. But an unhappy ac|cident happened, whereby &s;everal per&s;ons were taken into cu&s;tody, by the Mar&eacute;chau&s;|&s;&eacute;e of the Lieutenant Criminel at the Cha|telet, for a riot in tho&s;e gardens; which &s;ubjects all per&s;ons, of whatever rank or country they may be, who draw &s;words in places of royalty, to an impri&s;onment of twenty-one years continuance. Among&s;t the number accu&s;ed, was the unfortunate Lord Dacie, although his &s;word had not left its &s;cabbard, and he had only been a &s;pectator to the di&s;order of the malecontents. &mdash;To a&s;&s;ert his innocence was left to fu|ture proofs, therefore he was hurried away to pri&s;on, with the other noble&s;&s;e and gen|try, who were the unhappy objects of the arbitrary mea&s;ures of de&s;potic power. The Prevo&s;t of the Ba&s;tille received tho&s;e per&s;ons
<PB N="89" REF="022876_0092_0FBA99951CD20958">
from the officers of the Chatelet, to who&s;e unhappy fate we &s;hall leave them, and relate what pa&s;&s;ed el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The pacquet in which Mr. Howard had taken his pa&s;&s;age for England, was, by contrary winds forced, when half channel over, in their track for Margate, on the breakers off the town of Helveot Sluys, and every &s;oul peri&s;hed; among&s;t whom were &s;everal pa&s;&s;engers of di&s;tinction.&mdash; Hereby we may ob&s;erve, the favours of all bountiful Heaven, who&s;e greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we too often con&s;true into a cur&s;e; &s;o much do we prize the &s;hort-&s;ighted infatuation of our &s;hallow di&s;cernments. The friends of Mr. Howard, on hearing the authentic ac|count of the lo&s;s of the pacquet, with the tragic cata&s;trophe of the per&s;ons on board, were one and all thankful to the di&s;pen&s;ation of Heaven, in ordering the le&s;&s;er evil to prevent a greater.</P>
<P>News arrived of Mr. Howard's &s;afety, &s;o far as the faculty could conjecture, wherein the fears of amputation, or a fever were re|moved;&mdash;the &s;plintered parts were knitted, though as a compound fracture the utmo&s;t care was nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t any dan|gerous &s;ymptom.&mdash;The misfortune of poor Dacie by this time was publicly known, for the news-papers announced the accu&s;ation and puni&s;hment.&mdash;The Duke of A&s;hbridge hereupon exerted all his court influence, to find means to extricate his &s;on;&mdash;but libe|ration

<P>This affair rendered the court of Lon|don active in demanding a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, who in the mo&s;t plau&s;ible point of view, was but a &s;pectator to the &s;cene of riot the natives had &s;olely enacted: to which re|mon&s;trance the court of Ver&s;ailles attended, and liberated the per&s;on of Lord Dacie; yet not without manife&s;t regret, and wholly granting it as a national favour, rather than acknowledge the innocence of his lord&s;hip: &mdash;&s;o much for the happine&s;s and &s;afety of the &s;ubjects of the grand monarque.</P>
<P>During this period, the &s;cene of action was chiefly confined to Great-Britain.&mdash; The limb of Mr. Howard, which received the accident, now (by &s;ome alteration in the application) mended but &s;lowly; and the nece&s;&s;ary bandages, and the continued &s;ituation of an exact po&s;ture, brought on a &s;ort of an intermitting fever.&mdash;This alarm|ing &s;ymptom gave Mi&s;s Colville fre&s;h cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s,&mdash;which &s;howed it&s;elf in a manife&s;t change in the &s;tate of her health, and by the advice of phy&s;icians, Bath waters were deemed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; to which place, Lord and Lady Colville removed, with their daughter, for that purpo&s;e.</P>

There|fore opiates were nece&s;&s;arily admini&s;tered, which took a little effect, and of cour&s;e the &s;oporiferous draught was increa&s;ed, which operated &s;o powerfully, that an everla&s;ting &s;leep was dreaded as the con&s;equence; for during an interval of two days and nights, no remedy availed to revive her from a &s;tu|pefaction. All this time, Lord and Lady Colville were almo&s;t frantic, and the di&s;|carded relation, Mi&s;s Dampier, was per|mitted to &s;ee her cou&s;in; yet her pre&s;ence or that of any other vi&s;itant had no effect.&mdash; Lady Ann Cate&s;by and Lady Olivia Beau|mont were exceedingly affected, as were all friends who vi&s;ited this amiable young lady.</P>

<P>Lady Olivia Beaumont found many in|conveniencies &s;ince his Lord&s;hip's return from the continent; he wore &s;uch a face of &s;anctity, that the Marquis and Marchione&s;s of Languedoc were upon all occa&s;ions hap|py to &s;ee his Lord&s;hip.

world it was a cloak which covered all the vile nakedne&s;s of craft and &s;ubtlety.&mdash;In this ma&s;ked character his Lord&s;hip did not fail to write in cour&s;e to Mr. Howard, who was fully &s;atisfied of his Lord&s;hip's &s;incerity; and was &s;o far wrapped up in his faith, as to intru&s;t his pacquet for Mi&s;s Colville to the care of this &s;on of &s;anctity.&mdash;But in this &s;tep he was certainly wrong, for where deceit has been once practi&s;ed, that per&s;on &s;hould never be tempted to violate the laws of fidelity again.</P>
<P>The curio&s;ity &s;uch a tru&s;t excited in him, did &s;o powerfully work upon his weakne&s;s, that it was to him an impo&s;&s;ibility to with|&s;tand the temptation; he therefore formed a re&s;olve at all events to &s;ee the contents of the pacquet. Thus he fell to a contempti|ble breach of honor and integrity, betraying the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him; which could an|&s;wer no end whatever, but only to &s;how the frailty of human nature when it became de|praved:&mdash;&s;o that little heed &s;hould be given to the returning hone&s;ty of the &s;ons of pro|digality.&mdash;To heal their tainted principles is as much impo&s;&s;ible, as to re&s;tore to life the dead corp&s;e that is in a &s;tate of putrefac|tion; and it &s;hould be a &s;ettled maxim with the inexperienced of either &s;ex, to &s;hun the company of all tho&s;e who have led a di&s;&s;o|lute life; for as it is impo&s;&s;ible for the leo|pard to change his &s;pots, in like manner is the &s;ame ta&s;k of impo&s;&s;ibility to tho&s;e who

<P>The wor&s;t &s;tate a man can fall into is to make a mockery of that &s;ublime &s;y&s;tem which begins at the heart, and reaches up to Heaven, to enter the ears of the omni&s;cient being, who perceives our mo&s;t inward or re|mote thoughts; therefore, it is more than madne&s;s to attempt to act the hypocrite, when our opponent is no le&s;s a being than God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now Lord Dacie having broke the faith, he found the &s;ecret of Mr. Howard's heart, which was an expre&s;&s;ion of pure love for Mi&s;s Colville, by which all the former bitterne&s;s of the &s;pirit of rival&s;hip revived in his Lord&s;hip's brea&s;t; he was therefore re&s;olved to make the mo&s;t of every oppor|tunity: however, he had no confidant, his evil genius directing him &s;olely; but he &s;oon found out a &s;cheme which he put in
<PB N="97" REF="022876_0100_0FBA9AAA5BCD9590">
practice in the following extraordinary man|ner.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Colville did not receive her u&s;ual weekly pacquet, therefore was very unhappy at the neglect of Mr. Howard. Her con|jectures were various upon the occa&s;ion, as &s;he could not &s;urmi&s;e what to impute it to. &mdash;Lord Dacie readily conceived the cau&s;e of that lady's unea&s;ine&s;s; he added a forgery to the pacquet committed to his care, by fixing a day, in which he mentioned Mr. Howard would arrive in England; and as he meant to &s;urpri&s;e his friends, reque&s;ted &s;he would meet him at the Devizes, a town on the London road, &s;ome few miles from Bath; that by his entr&eacute; unawares, his fa|ther, and all their friends at Bath, would meet with an agreeable &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>This device was framed, as he knew Mi&s;s Colville went out daily in a carriage beyond the verge of the city of Bath.&mdash;He &s;ealed up the pacquet, and had it delivered by a per|&s;on, as though he arrived expre&s;s with it.&mdash; The news of this po&s;t revived the lady, to whom it was directed;&mdash;&s;he felt every power a&s;&s;ume its wonted regulation; &s;he peru&s;ed, dige&s;ted, and then &s;eemed amazed at the oddity of Mr. Howard's whim, as the letter repre&s;ented; and as &s;he perceived &s;ome|what in the difference of the hand-writing, and the &s;tyle of the lines which were the counterfeit part, &s;he was &s;tagnant in opinion
<PB N="98" REF="022876_0101_0FBA9AABD1487040">
re&s;pecting it;&mdash;however, the conveyance by the po&s;t, expre&s;s as &s;he conceived, and his &s;eal to it, put it beyond a doubt as ge|nuine.&mdash;This craft &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that Lord Dacie was preparing all his nece&s;&s;ary apparatus to put his &s;cheme into practice, when he received another pacquet, inclo&s;ed in one to him&s;elf, and directed as before for Mi&s;s Colville.&mdash;This he al&s;o broke open, and found by its contents, that in reality Mr. Howard had determined to return to England, on the very day following that which he had appointed in the pacquet al|ready delivered, therefore, it made him more vigorous in his plan;&mdash;for he found it now wrought up to a pitch of de&s;peration:&mdash; for what was now done, he knew would rai&s;e a potent enemy in Mr. Howard, and expo&s;e him to the &s;hame and cen&s;ure of the whole nation;&mdash;therefore he thought the plan that he had laid down, could he carry it through, and gain his point, the excu&s;e of an ardent lover would be &s;ufficient to palliate for the duplicity he might be charg|ed with.&mdash;Thus were at one and the &s;ame time, three grand deceptions carried on by this converted man of honor!&mdash;He deceiv|ed the liberal-minded Mr. Howard,&mdash;the charming, innocent fair, Mi&s;s Colville,&mdash; and the whole circle of his friends and ac|quaintance!&mdash;He was con&s;trained to place confidence in his valet de chambre, whom he bribed to be hone&s;t, as he called it,&mdash;

and po&s;ted him to look out for a &s;hip, bound to the city of Li&s;bon, or any of the Italian States. As for France, he had received partly his de&s;erts there, which rai&s;ed in him an implacable hatred for every thing that bore the name of French. This tru&s;ty &s;er|vant was a Portugueze by birth, therefore fitted to the work he was employed in.&mdash; He found a Captain who would &s;ail the day Lord Dacie propo&s;ed to &s;eize his prize,&mdash; but would wait a day longer in order to ac|commodate his Lord&s;hip;&mdash;as his pa&s;&s;en|gers were to be well paid for, he would &s;train a point to &s;erve him&s;elf and his friends.</P>
<P>The po&s;t brought a letter to Sir William Howard, announcing the day that Henry hoped to pay his duty to him at Bath.&mdash; This diffu&s;ed &s;uch a &s;pirit of joy in the wor|thy Baronet, that he could not forbear ac|quainting Mi&s;s Colville with the agreeable intelligence, at which &s;he &s;eemed greatly &s;urpri&s;ed; yet imagined &s;he was beforehand in her knowledge, and plea&s;ed her&s;elf with the agreeable ideas of Mr. Howard's frolic, to &s;urpri&s;e his friends a day &s;ooner than he was expected; &s;he therefore was amu&s;ing the cognitions of her mind with the plea&s;ures of idea, letting hope and an exuberant fancy &s;port in her bo&s;om, at the pro&s;pect that lay before her.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;he was thus agreeably entertain|ing her thoughts, the ba&s;e-minded Lord
<PB N="100" REF="022876_0103_0FBA9AAEE30EB370">
Dacie was getting ready all nece&s;&s;aries for his intended elopement. The day at length arrived, and Mi&s;s Colville, though &s;he ima|gined &s;he was in a few hours to &s;ee the per|&s;on for whom &s;he wi&s;hed to live, had a kind of prede&s;tination of fatality, which affected her &s;o much that &s;he fell into tears &s;everal times; this was ob&s;erved by her dome&s;tics, who were anxious to know her di&s;order,&mdash; but &s;he waved all direct an&s;wers. By the&s;e eva&s;ions her women &s;uppo&s;ed her mind to be &s;omewhat di&s;ordered, and &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo|&s;ed her going out that morning;&mdash;this li|berty of her &s;ervants made her in a peremp|tory manner, command &s;ilence, in which they implicitly obeyed.</P>
<P>She no &s;ooner got into her carriage, than another flood of involuntary tears gu&s;hed from her eyes,&mdash;a pre&s;age of a particular change.&mdash;The coach went on at a quick pace, but ere &s;he reached Devizes by three miles of the road, it being a lone&s;ome place, no hou&s;es or per&s;ons near, a po&s;t-chai&s;e and four hor&s;es appeared, out of which two men ru&s;hed with ma&s;ks on, and without ceremo|ny commanded the coachman to &s;top, for|cing Mi&s;s Colville out of her carriage and thru&s;ting her into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, into which one of them &s;tept, whil&s;t the other rode on hor&s;eback with a loaded blunderbu&s;s in his hand.&mdash;The chai&s;e drove off at a great rate, taking the cro&s;s roads, and avoiding the town that was then partly in view, di&s;tant
<PB N="101" REF="022876_0104_0FBA9AB207EF7A98">
nearly three miles.&mdash;Previous to their de|parture, they gave the coachman and foot|man, who conducted Mi&s;s Colville, a cau|tion to depart homeward to Bath, on pain of the forfeiture of their lives;&mdash;with which they readily complied.</P>
<P>Words cannot de&s;cribe the agony of Mi&s;s Colville!&mdash;&s;he &s;hrieked out, tore her hair, and in vain called for help, and then fell into a convul&s;ion fit; but the ravi&s;her, who had her now in his cu&s;tody, had no pity on her cries and lamentations, telling her, on her revival, that as &s;he regarded her life, welfare and &s;afety, to forbear making &s;uch noi&s;e;&mdash;and endeavoured to &s;ooth her, by informing her that &s;he &s;hould be conducted to a place of &s;afety, and find a friend there ready to receive her, who loved and adored her.&mdash;She, however received no con&s;olation from this flattering tale, continuing to vent her grief in torrents of &s;howers, that fell from her lovely eyes;&mdash;tears of heated brine of &s;orrow, that &s;calded and wounded her beauteous cheeks as they fell.</P>
<P>The tyrant was relentle&s;s, and clo&s;ed up the blinds, not permitting her to leave her &s;eat for nearly twenty hours, having provid|ed nece&s;&s;aries for the journey, which were in the carriage.&mdash;Of the&s;e refre&s;hments the afflicted lady would not partake.&mdash;The &s;tra|tagem practi&s;ed on her,&mdash;the dangers &s;he had to encounter,&mdash;the lo&s;s of Mr. Howard,

<P>No &s;ooner was &s;he &s;eated in the cabin, than the two ma&s;qued men took off their di&s;gui&s;es, and in their per&s;ons &s;he perceived, to her utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and mortifica|tion,&mdash;Lord Dacie and his valet de chambre! &mdash;She was then, if po&s;&s;ible, more mi&s;erable than before;&mdash;&s;he felt every pang redou|bled; &s;he then readily recollected the for|gery of the pacquet, and that it really mu&s;t have been intercepted;&mdash;&s;he accu&s;ed his Lord&s;hip with it,&mdash;he did not he&s;itate to own it,&mdash;and only &s;aid, he thought every &s;cheme laudable whereby he could &s;ecure her in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;&mdash;for he had determin|ed not to exi&s;t without her, and therefore hoped &s;he would make him happy in a few days.&mdash;He would give her a week to make up her mind, which, if not favourable to his expectations, he mu&s;t u&s;e force to make her comply with his de&s;ires, as his inten|tions were honorable;&mdash;and &s;hould as &s;oon as they reached the de&s;tined port, make her

<P>It would baffle de&s;cription to &s;et forth the ravings of her parents,&mdash;her brothers, &s;i&s;ter, and Sir William Howard; with the re&s;t of her friends.&mdash;Henry arrived!&mdash;His Hen|rietta and his fal&s;e friend Dacie, were both mi&s;&s;ing!

He made the coachman and foot|man who attended Mi&s;s Colville, relate all the particulars of the u&s;age of the ravi&s;her. A hue and cry was rai&s;ed! It was all in vain, for no per&s;on had &s;een a lady of her de&s;cription, no inn keeper &s;aw &s;uch travel|lers,&mdash;all enquiry was without effect.</P>

<P>"I perceive you give way to an indul|gence of your grief,&mdash;a pa&s;&s;ion, in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, very unbecoming; but if you per&s;evere in it, the effects will be of a &s;erious con&s;equence,&mdash;for," continued he, "if you mourn the lo&s;s of that &s;piritle&s;s fellow, Henry Howard, your penchant &s;hall be gratified;&mdash;he &s;hall have your charms, if you are willing to re&s;ign your&s;elf to his care in preference to mine;&mdash;but this you are to remark, as the te&s;t of truth, that I &s;hall reap tho&s;e &s;weets that were &s;o long in|tended for Mr. Howard;&mdash;and only two days further con&s;ideration &s;hall be granted, in which you are to determine on the mat|ter.&mdash;The choice is in &s;ub&s;tance this,&mdash;you mu&s;t at all events yield to my embraces at that period;&mdash;if it is willingly performed on your part, I &s;hall e&s;pou&s;e you in legal form on our arrival at Li&s;bon, and then return with you to England as my lady:&mdash; and con&s;ider, Madam, that my family and fortune are equal to your own, and that you once had con&s;ented to give me your hand; which contract would have been long &s;ince con&s;ummated, were it not for the &s;chemes of your compo&s;ing, as well as tho&s;e of my cou|&s;in,

Mi&s;s Dampier:&mdash;for to her I owe the hard&s;hips I have felt, ever &s;ince Mr. How|ard returned from his travels.&mdash;But on the other hand, if it is a forced compliance on your part, the con&s;equence will be this, I &s;hall detain you during my plea&s;ure, and then &s;end you home by the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el I &s;hall find &s;uitable for your &s;afe conveyance, to that idol of your affections; and no doubt, as he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much religion, he will thankfully accept you, and be re&s;igned to his fate of being comuted, as many men of rank and fa&s;hion often are.&mdash;So, Madam," continued Dacie, "you are at liberty to be a wife or a mi&s;tre&s;s, both of which are free|ly &s;ubmitted to your own choice; whereby a &s;tate of future repentance on your own part may be avoided.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall now withdraw, by to-morrow you will be more recollected in your thoughts, &mdash;and as it is now calm weather, I &s;hall not di&s;turb your re&s;t any longer."&mdash;On &s;aying the&s;e words he wi&s;hed her a good night, and retired to his room on the other &s;ide of the cabin.</P>
<P>This choice, as Lord Dacie had termed it, was more than a dagger to the &s;oul of Mi&s;s Colville. She, in de&s;pair, prayed to the author of her being, to relea&s;e her from the tyranny of this wicked man, by calling her hence,&mdash;as there were no other means, in human probability, to protect her from the loath&s;ome embraces of a man in whom was

every &s;pecies of villainy;&mdash;therefore the names of a wife or mi&s;tre&s;s, to &s;uch a per|&s;on, were equally odious; and who&s;e pro|mi&s;e of a performance to make legal the former appellation, was not to be relied on; at be&s;t it was &s;acrificing her&s;elf to a &s;on of Belial, from whom every evil con&s;equence was to be feared.</P>
<P>She &s;pent the night in lamenting her misfortunes, often earne&s;tly invoking the deity to avert the ruin that &s;o nearly threat|ened her.</P>
<P>In the combat of a re&s;ignation to the will of Heaven, the delu&s;ive enemy of our na|ture held out the quick means to avoid &s;hame and misfortune, by making her quie|tus in &s;uicide.&mdash;This alluring bait was gild|ed over with the beauties of Roman virtue, and an exaltation of mind, and the u&s;e of &s;uch means when nece&s;&s;ity required it, with a thou&s;and &s;ugge&s;tions equally palatable to a mind not fraught with the principles of un|corrupt religion;&mdash;but in all the&s;e methods of &s;eduction the enemy found nothing in her; and not being able to prevail, he re|tired, leaving her to conver&s;e with the &s;piri|tual comforts &s;he received from a &s;ole de|pendence in a re&s;igned &s;tate on the goodne&s;s and mercies of God: abhorring in her &s;oul the idea of &s;elf-murder,&mdash;that gloomy mon|&s;ter that recently hath &s;hown his power among&s;t Chri&s;tian nations.&mdash;The very op|po&s;ite power to the beneficence of the au|thor

of Nature.&mdash;For how can a creature, which is compo&s;ed of the du&s;t of the earth, pre&s;ume to di&s;embody him&s;elf, to appear naked in the pre&s;ence of glorious &s;pirits, be|fore the throne of grace, with the entire burthen of numberle&s;s imperfections laid open to view? It is a horrid thought in|deed! and is the mo&s;t depraved and attroci|ous crime man can commit.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock in the morning Lord Dacie again waited on Mi&s;s Colville, and by great per&s;ua&s;ion &s;he &s;ipped a little tea; not having taken any &s;u&s;tenance, that would vi|&s;ibly &s;upport human nature, &s;ince her decoy from Bath, except tea.</P>
<P>The day was nearly at a period when Lord Dacie again renewed his &s;olicitations to her concerning the propo&s;ed choice.&mdash;She mild|ly ob&s;erved;&mdash;that he &s;hould grant her time, till the &s;hip arrived in the port of her de&s;tination, to con&s;ider of the matter;&mdash;but in this he peremptorily refu&s;ed to comply. &mdash;His tenacious di&s;po&s;ition made her apply her&s;elf to rea&s;on with him, which &s;he did in the following words:</P>
<P>"I know, my Lord, I am now in your power, &s;o far as a command over my per&s;on will admit,&mdash;but &s;urely you will not be &s;o cruel to exert that prerogative over a per&s;on of my &s;ex, by &s;natching from me the feli|city of my future exi&s;tence, in depriving me of a title I prize equally with my life, and which in the fruition can afford you no &s;olid

&s;atisfaction. Reflect, but for a moment, the offence &s;uch a crime would give to the &s;u|preme being, and what de&s;truction it will bring down on your head for violating the laws of God and man!&mdash;You know the manner in which your wiles allured me from my friends; and although it was an impru|dent &s;tep in me even to con&s;ent to meet the man whom I thought was to be my hu&s;band, yet a tenderne&s;s for him, through a perfect knowledge of his honorable principles, made me comply.&mdash;The &s;tratagem you u&s;ed can never redound to your credit; &s;o that on a due con&s;ideration of the aggravated cha|racter of duplicity, that you acted both with me and all the world, I think you cannot do le&s;s than indulge me with time to make my election on the po&s;ition advanced by you.&mdash;Honor calls aloud to you not to violate her &s;y&s;tem in an action &s;o repugnant to the laws of human nature, both moral and divine; for even after the rites of the church were performed, it would be time enough to a&s;k any favour that is in my power to grant. "Pray, therefore," continued &s;he, "for Heaven's &s;ake don't triumph in my mi&s;ery;&mdash;but have pity on the feelings of human nature, and do not in&s;ult the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s &s;tate I am placed in;&mdash;your kindne&s;s herein &s;hall not pa&s;s without grateful ac|knowledgments."&mdash;Here tears &s;tarted in her eyes, and grief prevented her further utterance.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="022876_0114_0FBA9AC3D375D790">But the attentive Lord, with a &s;ullen brow replied, "Madam, it will not avail to try by the art of words to di&s;&s;uade me from my purpo&s;e; for if you and I are in this ve&s;&s;el on Sunday night, I &s;hall accom|pli&s;h my de&s;ires:&mdash;the re&s;t of the rites of honor leave to me.&mdash;Your demeanor &s;hall, agreeably to my propo&s;ition, en&s;ure you future regard;&mdash;for I &s;uppo&s;e you mean to claim protection at Li&s;bon, if you po&s;&s;e&s;s what I am determined you &s;hall not have in your power to plead; for if you are admit|ted but once to my bed, that court will not look upon you otherwi&s;e than as a wife or a mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;Here you &s;hall not be too crafty for me. Was I to admit this, it would be folly indeed; for I have been at a great deal of pains to bring matters to the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, therefore all &s;chemes to divert me from my purpo&s;e will be vague, and an&s;wer no inten|tion whatever.&mdash;So, Madam, de&s;i&s;t, and make your&s;elf happy;&mdash;for nothing on my part &s;hall impede it. If you can, make your|&s;elf ea&s;y, until an opportunity &s;erves to quiet your &s;tings of con&s;cience,&mdash;although with me, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it is an idle u&s;ele&s;s cere|mony." He ended here, &s;he rejoined in the mo&s;t pathetic manner to grant her re|que&s;t, alledging, &s;he would not take the ad|vantage of claiming national protection; (although it was her &s;ecret intention) but in all her rea&s;oning and fair promi&s;es the hard|hearted ravi&s;her &s;eemed unaffected.&mdash;She
<PB N="112" REF="022876_0115_0FBA9AC5957AE2D8">
cried and claimed on her knees his protection and favour; but he remained inexorable, and went aloft, leaving her to her own determi|nation, as he &s;aid, for no words could per|&s;uade him to change his brutal purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The next day pa&s;&s;ed, in which poor Mi&s;s Colville felt all the pangs that a malefactor can feel the day before execution.&mdash;Saturday morning&punc; was now approached,&mdash;the &s;ky looked red and lowering,&mdash;the face of heaven &s;eemed changed,&mdash;the winds &s;eemed how|ling and hollow&mdash;the &s;hip rolled exceeding|ly&mdash;the wind &s;et in to the &s;outhward,&mdash; upon which the Captain called all hands aloft;&mdash;every one did his part with alacrity, they &s;aw the winds were determined to con|te&s;t the point with the watery element.&mdash; Pre&s;ently vivid fla&s;hes of lightning rolled along the deck,&mdash;the echoing thunders, with dreadful murmurings pa&s;&s;ed through the watery clouds,&mdash;the wind in frantic &s;port to&s;|ed the &s;ea in mountain heaps, forming vallies at plea&s;ure;&mdash;the loaded &s;hip with difficulty went up the limped hill, but with redou|bled velocity ran down the &s;teep declivity, &mdash;thus the &s;hip and her cargo were become in a few hours the mock and &s;port of conte&s;t|ing elements.</P>
<P>Danger with all her terrific attendants made her appearance,&mdash;the Captain, in de&s;|pair, cried out hard weather!&mdash;to prayers! &mdash;and in the &s;ame in&s;tant almo&s;t, called to lighten the ve&s;&s;el!&mdash;Overboard were hove valuable bales of merchandize.&mdash;Death in

various forms &s;tared every one in the face,&mdash; all &s;eemed &s;truck with horror at the ap|proach of that grim-vi&s;aged monarch;&mdash;to all he &s;eemed terrible, except the amiable Henrietta;&mdash;&s;he &s;miled at their danger, and thanked heaven that had changed her &s;uffer|ings,&mdash;being happy to be in the power of God, in preference to that of vile &s;educing man;&mdash;with plea&s;ure offering up her breath into the hands of the being who had given it.</P>
<P>It was the rever&s;e with Lord Dacie;&mdash; in wild di&s;order his hair &s;tood erect,&mdash;he &s;aw death as the fell mon&s;ter of terror,&mdash; he prayed with de&s;pairing agony,&mdash;and in broken accents, with a mo&s;t fearful counte|nance, invoked the God of mercy to forgive his &s;inful &s;oul. Thus in his humility he craved forgivene&s;s from Henrietta for the wrongs he had done her, and al&s;o for tho&s;e he intended to perpetrate; and in his &s;eeming|ly dying words, &s;olemnly vowed, that if the &s;hip &s;hould outride the &s;torm, he would not attempt to violate the laws of moral recti|tude;&mdash;but that &s;he &s;hould be &s;afe in his care, and no in&s;ult ever &s;hould be offered.</P>
<P>The &s;torm after &s;ome hours abated, and by the appearance of the Sabbath-day re&s;ted from its vigorous fury, and about noon be|came perfectly &s;erene.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Colville was dubious of the faith &s;he could place in Lord Dacie's promi&s;es to her, though to witne&s;s them, he appealed to hea|ven;&mdash;and whil&s;t &s;he was ruminating on his
<PB N="114" REF="022876_0117_0FBA9AC851F78878">
words, he came to her bed&s;ide, and with a plea&s;ant a&s;pect, gave her notice, that that night was to afford him all that human hap|pine&s;s could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>The&s;e words &s;truck her with horror,&mdash;&s;he reminded him of his vows to heaven, and to forbear &s;uch wickedne&s;s;&mdash;her words were wa&s;ted in the air;&mdash;he &s;aid he had &s;worn to fulfil his de&s;ires, and that it was equally as great a &s;in to perjure him&s;elf by the omi&s;&s;ion, as the commi&s;&s;ion; and de&s;ired &s;he would not re&s;i&s;t: him.&mdash;She prayed him earne&s;tly to think of his words when death was near, and to forego his wicked purpo&s;es; for that &s;he was come to a determined re&s;olution, to lo&s;e her honor only with her life; and therefore, if he attempted to force her to a gratification of his unlawful de&s;ires, &s;he would not only re&s;i&s;t him, but oppo&s;e her &s;trength to his, and offen&s;ively maintain her privilege.&mdash; She hereupon called the Captain of the ve&s;&s;el, and craved his protection;&mdash;but Lord Dacie's pur&s;e had commanded him already, therefore, in vain were her intreaties; he was deaf to all her complaints,&mdash;and as for her threats, he knew they mu&s;t prove abortive, for Dacie's ends obtained, &s;et a&s;ide the force of complaint.</P>
<P>Now &s;eeing every refuge vani&s;h, except that of her own brea&s;t, &s;he was determined to yield only by the force of power;&mdash;bravely re&s;olving, and firmly determining, to peri&s;h in the conflict, rather than pollute her virtue.

&mdash;A principle which every lady of honor &s;hould imbibe;&mdash;for in defence of God's law, if a life is lo&s;t, the virtuous competitor lives or dies without an imputation of &s;in.</P>
<P>The clock time-piece &s;howed the fourth hour &s;ince noon.&mdash;Lord Dacie had con|firmed, with an evil imprecation, by an oath, that at &s;ix o'clock he would gain all he wi&s;hed for;&mdash;to which Mi&s;s Colville prote&s;|ted, in the pre&s;ence of heaven, he &s;hould not.&mdash;Her words were &s;carcely repeated, when the Captain &s;lipt down &s;tairs, and on entering the cabin, gave by his countenance &s;ymptoms of fear equal to tho&s;e which ap|peared on his brow during the preceding &s;torm.&mdash;He &s;aid, a cor&s;air was in cha&s;e of the &s;hip;&mdash;for a ve&s;&s;el had ju&s;t now hove in &s;ight, which had fired a gun to leeward to bring him to;&mdash;however, he had crowded all the canvas he could to e&s;cape. As for them&s;elves, as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, they would be &s;afe no doubt, as all the &s;tates of the pirati|cal infidels were in amity with Great-Britain; &mdash;but as for him, and his crew, together with the &s;hip and the remainder of the cargo that was &s;aved from the &s;torm, would cer|tainly be the ab&s;olute property of the infi|dels, who would make him and his crew &s;laves.</P>
<P>The reader may conjecture what were the difference of the feelings of Mi&s;s Colville, contra&s;ted with every other per&s;on on board. &mdash;It &s;ounded to her as a reprieve from hea|ven,

as &s;he had an uncle who had re&s;ided at Fez, in Morocco, but was now at Algiers, as Plenipotentiary from the Court of Great-Britain;&mdash;and added to this, &s;he was certain, on being reported, any of the &s;tates would free her.</P>
<P>Lord Dacie was petrified, and &s;tood agha&s;t, quite motionle&s;s, plainly perceiving her op|po&s;ition to the title of being his wife would &s;eparate them; and in all probability he &s;hould not meet with her again until they returned to England.&mdash;His countenance fell, &mdash;he lowered his tone,&mdash;and in faultering accents begged &s;he would pa&s;s for his wife; which a&s;&s;umption (he ob&s;erved) to the Ma|hometans, would pre&s;erve her from in&s;ult.&mdash; To this &s;he ha&s;tily replied,&mdash;"No, my Lord, I will tru&s;t my per&s;on with Turks or Heathens, rather than with a perjured wretch, who can claim no &s;anctity in any religion;&mdash;your heart is corrupt, therefore your words and actions partake too much of its quality;&mdash; &s;o of all mortals exi&s;ting, you are the mo&s;t dete&s;table to me; for even your dying words are not to be regarded."&mdash;"But," re|joined his Lord&s;hip, "admitting all you &s;ay to be true,&mdash;I don't mean to contradict you, only remain neuter, whil&s;t I inform the captors of our names, quality and na|tions&mdash;She replied, "Enough of your di&s;&s;i|mulation, I &s;hall not hold any conver&s;e with you, but claim their protection."</P>

&s;ight, and within a league, bearing down on them with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.&mdash;The Portugueze Captain &s;eeing it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape, was laying to for the Algerine to come up with them, as by their flag and pendant it was ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h what na|tion &s;he was of, although it was now near the du&s;k of the evening. The Portugueze &s;ailors were all pannic &s;truck, finding that &s;uch inveterate enemies were to be their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>In vain did Fernandez, Lord Dacie's &s;er|vant, who had procured the means to en|&s;lave him&s;elf, by acting in iniquity, the per|formance of trepanning Mi&s;s Colville, im|plore his ma&s;ter, to u&s;e his endeavours to obtain his liberty, as the &s;ervant of a Bri|ti&s;h Lord;&mdash;His Lord was too bu&s;ily em|ployed to attend to any thing he &s;aid;&mdash; whereupon the affrighted wretch fell on his knees before Mi&s;s Colville, imploring her favour and protection, which &s;he promi&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding his villainy, in conjunction with that of his ma&s;ter, was the means to bring her thither.&mdash;Even the ba&s;e-minded Captain Cordoza, al&s;o claimed a &s;hare of her favour and protection; although he had an hour before, denied her the like boon, at the greate&s;t extremity a virtuous mind could po&s;&s;ibly experience.</P>
<P>The galley was now along-&s;ide the &s;hip; the pirates boarded with their u&s;ual ferocity, clapping the Captain and all his crew into

irons.&mdash;Lord Dacie was taken into cu&s;tody and Fernandez would have partook of the &s;ame fate of his countrymen, but Mi&s;s Col|ville humanely interceded for him, by al|leging he was a Briti&s;h &s;ubject,&mdash;therefore he went with his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Captain of the galley was an Engli&s;h Renegado, who had fought under General Moun&s;ey in America, and recollected Mi&s;s Colville to be the General's &s;i&s;ter, which was a happy circum&s;tance; and &s;he therefore re|ceived all the politene&s;s that could be ex|pected from an apo&s;tate infidel Captain, who had cho&s;en this life, merely to get a &s;uffici|ent booty to enable him to live independent whenever he &s;hould think proper to &s;teal off to his own country.&mdash;But this is a bad &s;cheme indeed,&mdash;to hazard both &s;oul and body for filthy lucre!</P>
<P>The Captain of the galley immediately removed Mi&s;s Colville into the cabin of his war &s;hip;&mdash;he layed before her a variety of pre&s;erved fruits and &s;weetmeats, with a plen|ty of chocolate and coffee, made in the Eu|ropean manner.&mdash;This was a &s;ea&s;onable &s;up|ply, and the only hearty meal which that lady had eaten &s;ince &s;he left Bath; for though &s;he drank tea on board Cordoza's &s;hip, yet &s;he eat nothing except a bi&s;cuit about noon each day; &s;he was therefore through her late illne&s;s; and the harra&s;&s;ed &s;tate &s;he had ex|perienced, quite reduced to the appearance of a &s;keleton; and might be &s;aid to be no

more than &s;kin and bone, notwith&s;tanding the cruelty exerci&s;ed by Lord Dacie for the completion of his brutal de&s;ires, taking no pity on her reduced &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>The galley bore away for Algiers with her prize, where we &s;hall leave Mi&s;s Col|ville and Lord Dacie, and return to &s;ee what went on during this period in Eng|land.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard, Captain Colville, and General Moun&s;ey, having &s;pent a week, as was before remarked, in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch for Mi&s;s Colville, returned to Bath with all the dejection of &s;pirits imaginable. However their gloom, except that of the di&s;con&s;olate Henry, was &s;oon removed;&mdash;but he mourned his mate in &s;ilence.&mdash;Sir William Howard did all he could to con&s;ole his &s;on for the irreparable lo&s;s of the accompli&s;hed Mi&s;s Colville, and by degrees opened his mind to him with re&s;pect to another choice, naming Lady Ann Cate&s;by, or Lady Olivia Beaumont. But Mr. Howard knew where their hearts were engaged;&mdash;but if they were free, this propo&s;al at pre&s;ent would have no influence on Henry. The impre&s;&s;i|on already made by virtue and innocence were not ea&s;ily era&s;ed; the dear image of Henrietta was never out of his mind; and to reflect &s;he was in the arms of &s;uch a mon|&s;ter of deceit, as he was convinced Lord Dacie was, put him into flights of torment that bordered on in&s;anity.</P>

<P>Mr. Ward was now the con&s;tant and ac|cepted vi&s;itant at Fever&s;ham-Hou&s;e, the &s;eat of the Marquis of Languedoc.&mdash;He &s;aw and admired the talents and abilities of the young clergyman, and found out his daughter's inclinations to be fixed on that gentleman; therefore he was re&s;olved to prove the affection of Mr. Ward, before he made his purpo&s;e known.</P>
<P>About this time he admitted the honor|able Mr. Ward into his family, as his chap|lain, which was a de&s;irable &s;ituation for the accommodation of the lovers,&mdash;for every day afforded hours of conver&s;e;&mdash;and altho' Lady Olivia was not without a con&s;iderable

<P>A 'Squire Lee, and his &s;i&s;ter, who were the &s;i&s;ter's children of the Marquis, paid a vi&s;it at Fever&s;ham-Hou&s;e.&mdash;The Lady, who&s;e name was Arabella, and who was really a fine woman, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds, then in her own hands; &mdash;the Marquis therefore judged this a pro|per opportunity to try the &s;incerity of the honorable Chaplain's preten&s;ions, and in a friendly manner opened the bu&s;ine&s;s to him, by declaring his approbation, if his niece's affection could be obtained, which he had no doubt but Mr. Ward could with a&s;&s;idui|ty gain; and he &s;hould acquaint Mi&s;s Lee to look upon Mr. Charles Ward in quality of a &s;uitor in future.&mdash;This propo&s;ition &s;tag|gered Mr. Ward; he was cautious in giving offence, therefore, in reply to the Marquis, he returned him his &s;incere thanks, but de|clined his an&s;wer until he &s;hould acquaint his friends of the honor his Lord&s;hip pro|po&s;ed doing him, to admit him as a relation in his family.</P>
<P>The Marquis di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject for the pre&s;ent, but in a few days renewed it; when the generous-minded Ward, with a &s;incerity that would do honor to a prince, frankly owned he could not accept of the terms his Lord&s;hip had propo&s;ed;&mdash;and that had he &s;een the Lady in que&s;tion two years &s;ooner, he &s;hould have been happy to have embraced

the opportunity, as &s;he was a Lady of rank, fortune and beauty;&mdash;but he mu&s;t confe&s;s he loved a nearer relation to his Lord&s;hip, and that Lady was no other than his daugh|ter:&mdash;"And," continued Mr. Ward, "I &s;hall openly confe&s;s, I cannot be happy with any other Lady, were her preten&s;ions ever &s;o great to the high rated trifles of fortune;&mdash; for with Lady Olivia, I &s;hould be the happi|e&s;t man living, did &s;he but po&s;&s;e&s;s only a covering.&mdash;I would have &s;ooner made known my preten&s;ions, but the difference in the &s;cale of fortune, I judged, would mar them; now, my Lord, I a&s;&s;ume an equality of for|tune, as by the lo&s;s of my two elder brothers, one of whom died of a decline in the &s;outh of France a few days ago, and the other nearly about the &s;ame time of the like di&s;|order, in this kingdom, I am left to claim the honors of my father's title and fortune, whom I pre&s;ume you knew."&mdash;"Very well" replied the Marquis, "and now," continued he, "you are the Earl of Bellview, I pre|&s;ume."&mdash;"Yes, my Lord," rejoined Mr. Ward, "I am."&mdash;"Well then," &s;ays the Marquis, "I &s;hall let you know the whole of my intentions.</P>

I therefore &s;chemed the plan of proving your affections for my child, and this was the day I purpo&s;ed to open my mind to you, by offering you my daughter's hand:&mdash;for the wretched pa&s;&s;ion of avarice, I thank Heaven, has never had any dominion over me.&mdash;As I have but one child, was your income not to produce five pounds, annual|ly, there is enough to &s;upport the dignity of my family.&mdash;But now, my Lord Bellview, for in future &s;o I &s;hall call you, you are at li|berty to name the day you are to be my &s;on."</P>
<P>Mr. Ward, in a polite manner, thanked his Lord&s;hip, and ha&s;ted to relate to Lady Olivia the &s;ub&s;tance of their conver&s;ation,&mdash; as he had not &s;een her &s;ince the expre&s;s came with the news of both his brothers death. &mdash;The interview no doubt gave both parties &s;incere happine&s;s, to be permitted to a&s;&s;ure formally, what they &s;o long had been &s;ecret|ly, that is, true lovers;&mdash;but the death of &s;uch near relations obliged Mr. Ward to re|main for three months longer in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, until the period of mourning was at an end.</P>
<P>Captain Colville, during the time that Lord Colville, his father, forbad him to vi|&s;it Lady Ann Cate&s;by, was con&s;trained to carry on a corre&s;pondence with that Lady in the utmo&s;t privacy, well convinced of the violence of his father's pa&s;&s;ion, &s;hould he know of his di&s;obedience. He had an a&s;|&s;urance
<PB N="125" REF="022876_0128_0FBA9ADE138F4360">
of the Lady's affections for him, and had on tho&s;e grounds imprudently men|tioned to her the practicability of an elope|ment,&mdash;which had &s;uch an effect on her principles, that &s;he doubted the Captain's &s;incerity for a con&s;iderable time afterwards. This is a very proper remark to be made by every Lady who has moral rectitude, and a care and regard for her character, to &s;hun the man who would propo&s;e &s;uch a hazard|ous &s;cheme; which carries infamy in the very name of it, and &s;hows that the woman who con&s;ents to elope under the &s;anction of immediate marriage, is no better in her vir|tuous principles, than the mi&s;tre&s;s who con|&s;ents to go into lodgings, until her &s;educer fulfils his promi&s;e; which by the bye he ne|ver meant to perform.&mdash;<HI>Sans changer comme je fus!</HI></P>
<P>The Captain was very much alarmed at the diffidence Lady Ann had a&s;&s;umed, in her credence of his &s;incerity; he on all occa&s;ions endeavoured to per&s;uade her of his integri|ty of heart, and that his intentions were to get the marriage rites performed in private, as the family difference had retarded it, the preliminaries whereof had been long &s;ince &s;ettled;&mdash;but all he could advance had but little influence on Lady Ann,&mdash;&s;he was of a contrary compo&s;ition to that of her brother, Lord Dacie;&mdash;&s;he was virtuous and dutiful, but very timorous, which was a guard over
<PB N="126" REF="022876_0129_0FBA9AE127778BD0">
her morals, a principle which &s;hould be im|bibed by the younger part of the &s;ex; for they cannot be too cautious of the deceits and crafts of the world, e&s;pecially if a Lady is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of beauty or fortune, to en|gage the attention of the libertine or the fortune-hunter,&mdash;two dangerous and dete&s;t|able characters.</P>
<P>Meanwhile a true account was tran&s;mit|ted by Lady Dampier, to her hu&s;band, from whom &s;he was but ju&s;t come over (for Sir James was a &s;econd time appointed re&s;ident at Algiers) of the &s;tigma ca&s;t on their fa|mily, by the imprudence of their daughter, and the deceit of her nephew, Lord Dacie, whom &s;he had drawn in his true colours, without re&s;erve;&mdash;and in her narrative gave him to under&s;tand, that the &s;hame and odi|um brought on their daughter Charlotte was irreparable,&mdash;as his Lord&s;hip had eloped with Mi&s;s Colville, whom he decoyed by &s;tratagem:&mdash;and entreated Sir James to re|turn to England as &s;oon as he could, for on her return home &s;he had found, that by Charlotte's imprudent conduct, his affairs required a &s;peedy rectitude in many particu|lars.</P>
<P>This news came to hand a fews days pre|vious to the return of the Renegado with his prize to Algiers, which had the de&s;ired effect on Sir James, for he immediately di&s;|patched a me&s;&s;enger to England, claiming letters of recall from his emba&s;&s;y;&mdash;and in
<PB N="127" REF="022876_0130_0FBA9AE3352316A0">
con&s;equence waited only the return of the me&s;&s;enger to fulfil the forms of office pre|vious to his departure for England.</P>
<P>His uniform conduct and proper demean|or gained him the countenance and favour of the Dey, who re&s;pected him very much; and as marks of his approbation and e&s;teem, made him many valuable pre&s;ents. The officers of &s;tate, belonging to the Bar|barian Court were al&s;o greatly taken with the manner of Sir James's rectitude, and particularly Benhaded Mu&s;tapha Beg, who was the Abalaroux, or Captain General of the Dey's forces, who&s;e galley the Renegado commanded, which had taken the Portu|gueze &s;hip.</P>
<P>The galley arrived with her prize in &s;afe|ty. Benhaded Mu&s;tapha Beg, the Captain General, and Sir James Dampier, were then at Oxora, a village three miles from the city of Algiers, on a party of plea&s;ure, cre|ated merely to entertain Sir James, in terms of friend&s;hip, prior to his departure for Eng|land; and of con&s;equence the Captain of the galley was under the nece&s;&s;ity of bring|ing thither all the captives or ran&s;omers taken in the prize.</P>
<P>The Renegado made his appearance with Cordoza and his crew as captives; Mi&s;s Colville, Lord Dacie, and his &s;ervant Fer|nandez (at the in&s;tance of Mi&s;s Colville) as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; who, on the interpo&s;ition

of Sir James Dampier, as repre&s;entative of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, were to be liberated and &s;ent to England, at the expen&s;e of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The weather being at this &s;ea&s;on very plea&s;ant in Barbary, the rural retreat of the Mahometan Chieftain was very well laid out to enjoy the luxury of Mu&s;&s;ulmen; for the Haaram or petty Seraglio for the female captives of Chri&s;tian nations, was in the form of a &s;emicircle, clo&s;e to the rotundity whereof were the apartments of tho&s;e un|happy per&s;ons which Providence had permit|ted for his own wi&s;e purpo&s;es to fall into the hands of this Infidel Chief. In the interior part, from the radical line which formed the &s;egment, was a beautiful garden, which, contrary to the general practice of the Ma|hometans, was laid out in all the art and ta&s;te of European nations. In the middle of this delightful &s;pot was a &s;mall neat building, in the Ottoman &s;tyle, with pro|jected balconies, &s;o that the front which formed the piazza, overlooked the platform, which was enclo&s;ed by pali&s;ades of curious workman&s;hip, which entrance into this pri|&s;on palace was more difficult than a Euro|pean could conceive; and was merely that captives &s;hould, under the parade of the at|tendant eunuchs, enter in a pageant to &s;et forth the grandeur of this Mahometan Lord.</P>
<P>Sir James Dampier and Mu&s;tapha Beg
<PB N="129" REF="022876_0132_0FBA9AE5D2CBEB90">
were at the Balcony when the Captain of the galley entered with his pageant. The Cap|tain fir&s;t, and the ran&s;omers following. Sir James no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes on the pri&s;on|ers, than he immediately recognized his niece, Mi&s;s Colville, and the nephew of his Lady, Lord Dacie, who had brought &s;hame to his family; he therefore with a &s;uitable dignity informed the Lordly General, that the Lady who had pa&s;&s;ed into the portico of in&s;pection was his niece, and that the Lord who followed the captives was a nephew to Lady Dampier; and gave him a detail of &s;uch part of the intelligence which he had received from Europe as he judged material to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mu&s;tapha Beg was happy to have it in his power to oblige Sir James, and in&s;tantly di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger attendant to bring thither the Lady. On the &s;ummons of the eunuch, Mi&s;s Colville was petrified with fear, le&s;t any immode&s;t liberty &s;hould be taken before &s;he could apply to the court of Al|giers for protection, not knowing where to find her uncle. But the Renegado Captain di&s;pelled her fears, with an a&s;&s;urance that nothing was to be feared from his Lord, for that the Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador was with him, therefore it was a fortunate circum&s;tance. On hearing this, &s;he with ha&s;te accompani|ed the attendant to the pre&s;ence chamber, where &s;he was at the door &s;aluted by Benha|ded,
<PB N="130" REF="022876_0133_0FBA9AE71BD175C0">
who retired, that Sir James might have an opportunity of embracing his niece and hear the &s;tory of her adventures.&mdash;This was a &s;ignal favour of the utmo&s;t re&s;pect from a proud Mu&s;&s;ulman.</P>
<P>Sir James received in his arms his niece, and wept over her with different emotions; &mdash;fir&s;t, with grief, &s;uppo&s;ing her debauched by the vile &s;educer who accompanied her,&mdash; and then with joy, on being &s;o fortunate as to have it in his power to protect her, and give her every comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, until he &s;hould bring her &s;afe to her di&s;con&s;olate parents,&mdash;being convinced, from the amo|rous di&s;po&s;ition of Mu&s;tapha, that had he &s;et out for his native country, her tran&s;cend|ent beauty would have endangered her li|berty.</P>
<P>The overjoyed and &s;urpri&s;ed Lady dropt quite in&s;en&s;ible in his arms, and not with|out the &s;ervices of an attendant eunuch was brought to a &s;tate of &s;en&s;ibility.&mdash;Return|ing animation gave her a&s;toni&s;hed &s;en&s;es rea&s;onable application;&mdash;&s;he poured out ble&s;&s;ings on her dear uncle, who was the a|gent of Heaven, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the mo&s;t critical juncture.&mdash;She then related the whole &s;tory of her extraordinary hi&s;tory, &s;ince her return from America, until that in|&s;tant period; the recital of which drew a &s;econd time tears from the manly brow of Sir James; for his feelings were acute, when &s;uffering innocence experienced &s;uch &s;evere

trials. He joined with his worthy relation in returning thanks to the Omnipre&s;ent Power that protected her from pollution under the dominion of the agent of Satan, who (Mi&s;s Colville found out by the &s;ervant Fernandez who&s;e liberty &s;he &s;ought to re&s;tore) had by a large bribe gained over the Renegado Cap|tain to report them to be man and wife;&mdash; which would afford him an opportunity to accompli&s;h his wicked de&s;ign on her virtue. As Dacie did not know Sir James had been removed from Fez, by his own choice, to Algiers, therefore at the expen&s;e of every thing &s;acred, the wicked man purpo&s;ed to perpetrate the villainous work he had un|dertaken;&mdash;but the Omni&s;cient Power fru|&s;trated his de&s;ired purpo&s;e, and expo&s;ed all his artful projects, to his utter &s;hame and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>After a long conference, the waiting eu|nuch acquainted his Lord of Sir James's wi&s;h for his return, which was complied with by his immediate pre&s;ence; upon which Sir James gave the &s;ub&s;tance of his niece's adventures, and on hearing of it, he in a friendly manner congratulated him and the Lady on her miraculous e&s;capes from &s;ur|rounding dangers, and on her arrival at a place of &s;afety;&mdash;generou&s;ly offering her all the &s;ervices in his power to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>She, with every acknowledgment thank|ed him for his kind profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip,

and in an opportune and &s;ea&s;onable minute, craved the liberty of Cordoza (notwith&s;tand|ing his behaviour to her in the hour of trial and imminent danger) as &s;he had promi&s;ed him &s;o to do, in kind compa&s;&s;ion for his fa|mily, he having a wife and &s;everal children dependant on his indu&s;try,&mdash;who mu&s;t pine in want &s;hould his a&s;&s;i&s;tance be with-held; &mdash;for her &s;y&s;tem was to do good for evil, which in the end an&s;wered every good pur|po&s;e, as it was heaping coals of fire on the heads of enemies, and commanded their future friend&s;hip, with the due &s;en&s;e of gra|titude.&mdash;She al&s;o begged the liberty of Fer|nandez, Lord Dacie's &s;ervant, to whom &s;he had promi&s;ed her protection, and who was grateful for it, as the intelligence lately given had in&s;tanced,&mdash;for in &s;o doing he had incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of his ma&s;ter; &mdash;yet he was carele&s;s in that, choo&s;ing to flee from a man who&s;e employments would have inevitably made him a &s;lave for life, had not the injured innocent Lady, who with&s;tood the &s;hock of combined villainy, and which &s;he &s;u&s;tained with &s;urpri&s;ing for|titude, become an advocate for him; and to who&s;e benevolent di&s;po&s;ition he &s;hould be indebted for the term of his natural life,&mdash; Mi&s;s Colville having reported the truth that he was a Portugueze.</P>
<P>The courteous Mahometan without a mi|nute's he&s;itation, freely granted her reque&s;t; and ordered them in&s;tant liberation.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="022876_0136_0FBA9AEE2D0567E8">They were conducted to the Mu&s;tapha's pre&s;ence, and fell on their knees to return him thanks, which he refu&s;ed, &s;aying, "Thank that generous Lady, who fufils the belief your religion requires, in doing good to her enemies, in which character you have both acted your parts, though happily for her without much &s;ucce&s;s;&mdash;go and retain a due &s;en&s;e of gratitude, learn from a wo|man, a le&s;&s;on of true wi&s;dom, be thankful to the Supreme Being, repent and be hap|py."&mdash;He then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, but not be|fore they had with tears of gratitude, &s;incere|ly thanked a thou&s;and times, the goodne&s;s of Mi&s;s Colville.

<P>Lord Dacie was, during this time, in a painful &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e;&mdash;he was quite cre&s;t fallen, on finding his tru&s;ty &s;ervant in iniquity had recanted from his principles, and had not returned.&mdash;He was, as all ba&s;e minds are, on the appearance of danger of the mo&s;t trivial con&s;equence,&mdash;mean and grovelling,&mdash;ready to wor&s;hip the mo&s;t abject wretch that could &s;how the lea&s;t fa|vour.</P>

debauched! He would have &s;unk into a &s;tate of annihilation, could his will bring forth wi&s;hes into works!</P>
<P>Sir James, in the &s;tyle of a true Briton, a&s;ked him what he thought of human na|ture?&mdash;the works nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure a peaceable con&s;cience here, and a happy &s;tate hereafter!&mdash;to gain either, he had pur&s;ued a wrong method;&mdash;but he &s;hould help him to pur&s;ue another cour&s;e, which in the end would bring him to a due &s;en&s;e of the obli|gation he was under to him.</P>
<P>Lord Dacie found by the &s;tern a&s;pect of Sir James, that here his career mu&s;t end!&mdash; This guilt brought in accu&s;ation, and for the fir&s;t time, perhaps, in his whole life, he felt the pangs of compunction. His &s;ilence was an interpretation of the perturbed &s;tate of his mind; but Sir James undeceived him in his conjectures, and addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e words. "Pray, my Lord, which of tho&s;e Ladies is the real object of your choice,&mdash;my daughter or my niece?&mdash;I find you are re|&s;olved to be a near relation of mine."&mdash;Da|cie, with a downca&s;t look, and a &s;igh, re|plied, "Sir, I have abu&s;ed your family, it is true, and perhaps would have gone farther, were it not for the accident that prevented me."&mdash;"Silence your wicked tongue," re|plied Mi&s;s Colville, "it was not accident that prevented you, nor chance either, but the interpo&s;ition of an invi&s;ible power, who&s;e influence only can bring you to an acknow|ledgment

<P>Lord Dacie found that Sir James had re|ceived the full particulars of his conduct in England, he therefore was fearful of his an|ger,&mdash;as cowardice is in&s;eparable from ba&s;e principles, and in a tone of humble &s;uppli|cation craved his pardon;&mdash;and that he would repair as much as in him lay, the in|jury he had done.&mdash;Sir James, who per|ceived that Lord Dacie would not only pro|mi&s;e to perform, but ab&s;olutely &s;wear to any thing that &s;hould avert for the pre&s;ent mo|ment his di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;eemingly, therefore, acquie&s;ced in the &s;olemnity of his Lord|&s;hip's a&s;&s;ertions,&mdash;finding it of no real &s;er|vice in the cau&s;e of his daughter, to enlarge farther upon a &s;ubject which gave him pain in the recital.&mdash;Be&s;ides, Lord Dacie would not have been his choice for a &s;on-in-law, had his daughter behaved with prudence and di&s;cretion.</P>

<P>Sir William Howard and his &s;on having retired to the family &s;eat at Howard's Ca&s;tle, &s;pent their time in happy conver&s;e on the mutability of mundane enjoyments; and by oppo&s;ing philo&s;ophy with religion, Sir Wil|liam ea&s;ily demon&s;trated the theory and practice of both,&mdash;when to his &s;atisfaction he plainly perceived the near affinity the one had to the other;&mdash;for philo&s;ophy, which is a word derived from the Greek, &s;ignifying a love of wi&s;dom, is that u&s;eful &s;cience, which comprehends the whole &s;y&s;tem of mo|rality, or the duties of human life, common|ly called ethics.</P>
<P>The next thing it comprehends, is the knowledge of the cau&s;es and effects of things, whether external or internal, in the air, earth, or waters, which may be &s;aid to pro|ceed from natural cau&s;es, agreeably to the order of creation by the Supreme Being.&mdash;

The other part of the &s;cience, is in the curi|ous &s;peculation of the exi&s;tence of things; by which calculations in the revolution of the Heavenly bodies are made, with other experiments which are commonly called the Phoenomena of Nature.</P>
<P>Religion (which is derived from the He|brew, &s;ignifies the duties of human crea|tures to the Deity, and to their own &s;pecies) may be &s;ubdivided into three parts, com|prehending natural, moral, and revealed.&mdash; The fir&s;t was the wor&s;hip of the Gentile world;&mdash;the &s;econd, by the Jews under the law;&mdash;the third to the Chri&s;tians, through the atonement for &s;in by the Me&s;&s;iah, where|by the law is done away, and the world is now under grace, that all who repent of their iniquities and believe, may receive re|mi&s;&s;ion thereof and be &s;aved.</P>

<P>Lady Ann, although &s;he had treated the Captain rather &s;evere, yet was &s;atisfied of her having &s;ufficient provocation, by the in|&s;ult he had offered to her virtue, in propo|&s;ing an elopement;&mdash;for though &s;he really loved the &s;on of Mars with all the ardency of a prudent lady, yet &s;he had re&s;olved never to break the commandment of God, by di&s;o|beying her parents;&mdash;or provoke the wrath of Heaven, by violating its holy laws, in making a private match, though it had been with a Monarch, without their entire con&s;ent and approbation;&mdash;and had rather, in obe|dience to their commands, have given her hand, to a per&s;on of their choice, to be her hu&s;band, though the compliance &s;hould make her days mi&s;erable, than run counter, in making her own bargains, without their con&s;ent.

<P>Lord Fairford paid her a vi&s;it in due form; &mdash;but the lady, with an hone&s;t &s;incerity a&s;|&s;ured him, it was in vain for him ever to expect a compliance in her, to be &s;uitable to his expectations;&mdash;therefore it would be advi&s;eable in him to de&s;i&s;t, as his &s;olicitations would an&s;wer no end.</P>

<P>His Lord&s;hip could hold out no longer, &mdash;his heat was vi&s;ible&mdash;as he perceived the lady had in &s;entiment an advantage over him.&mdash;He replied in a ha&s;ty tone, that not|with&s;tanding he might not be the object of her choice, yet to &s;uit his own inclinations, he &s;hould repeat his vi&s;its &s;o often, as to preclude her an opportunity of receiving the favors of the di&s;carded Captain,&mdash;alluding to Captain Colville:&mdash;"But," continued he, &mdash;"if I find that hero is continued in your

<P>Lord Fairford was ha&s;ty in his temper, therefore he could not tamely &s;ubmit to the rebuke of a lady, for the unmanly part he had acted,&mdash;but with a &s;eeming &s;how of in|difference, forced a loud laugh,&mdash;which gave occa&s;ion to the lady to leave him to his own private thoughts.&mdash;This he did not notice, but paid her repeated vi&s;its;&mdash;and finding the vanity of his preten&s;ions, was re&s;olved to &s;how to his mi&s;tre&s;s the greatne&s;s of his &s;pirit, that &s;he might not think &s;o &s;lightly of him, as he perceived plainly, &s;he had on all occa|&s;ions given him to under&s;tand.&mdash;So in the hour of heated imagination, by the aiding a&s;&s;i&s;tance of old hock, he &s;ent a challenge to Captain Colville, or rather a threatened cha&s;ti&s;ement, as though he had dominion over him.&mdash;The letter was as follows:&mdash;

<P>The morning gave his Lord&s;hip an op|portunity of reading the &s;pirited an&s;wer of his rival; he was very much perplexed how to manage matters;&mdash;and as his name was enrolled in knight-errantry, on taking a re|peated bumper of brandy, he &s;ent the Cap|tain a downright challenge, to meet him the next morning at eight o'clock, with his friend, at an appointed ground.&mdash;This was delivered by Lord Fairford's &s;ervant, by whom the Captain returned a written an&s;wer, in which he acknowledged the <HI>receipt,</HI> and accepted the <HI>treat.</HI></P>

<P>After a ceremonial had taken place be|tween Lord Mu&s;tapha and the Ladies, Lord Dacie was &s;ummoned to attend; and on his introduction, the Algerine informed him, he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee the ceremony of marriage performed by the Amba&s;&s;ador's chaplain, which would make his Lord&s;hip happy in the lady for whom he had heard him expre&s;s &s;uch a &s;trong regard, and which would, according to the Chri&s;tian laws, make them one fle&s;h.</P>

<P>Lord Dacie and his Lady were very &s;oon reconciled and happy in each other, for they were of a di&s;po&s;ition not many degrees apart; therefore were the more likely to a&s;&s;ure an agreement in the road of life.&mdash;He, by many &s;olemn formalities of &s;orrow for his pa&s;t offences again&s;t Mi&s;s Colville, craved her forgivene&s;s;&mdash;the bountiful lady did not withhold the boon, as &s;he &s;aw he was now fixed in the walk of life, and his preten&s;ions to roam were at an end.</P>

<P>Death now &s;eemed to all inevitable, &s;o each re&s;igned him&s;elf to God in prayer!&mdash; but Lord Dacie e&s;&s;ayed to go up to the rails, which formed the netting on the quarter deck, &mdash;in this he was oppo&s;ed by the two wounded Noblemen, who remon&s;trated with him on the impropriety of &s;uch conduct;&mdash;but he replied, death was as certain between decks as above, and as he could &s;wim well, perhaps he might &s;ave his life.&mdash;In this whim, or rather pre&s;uming notion, he was joined by Lord Fairford, who &s;aid he had the like abi|lities.&mdash;Lord Belview advanced every thing he could again&s;t &s;uch a &s;tep,&mdash;adding, it was a piece of cruelty to leave the Ladies in

<P>His Lord&s;hip's words had no effect.&mdash;The Duke then conjured them to &s;tay and &s;hare their fate, ob&s;erving, that God's power was not abated;&mdash;and that there were &s;till hopes if they could put faith in that Beneficent Being, who never deceived any who really and &s;incerely relied on his mercy;&mdash;and fur|ther ob&s;erved, that notwith&s;tanding the vio|lence of the tempe&s;t, and the impetuo&s;ity of the waves, he had a full a&s;&s;urance in his mind, and re&s;ted confident, thro' his hope in God, that they &s;hould all get &s;afe to &s;hore. &mdash;He therefore entreated tho&s;e Lords not to abandon their wives, nor betray their confi|dence in the goodne&s;s of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>All that either the Duke or Lord Bellview could advance, had not any effect on tho&s;e congenial characters, who were in their feel|ings equally agitated.&mdash;The perturbed &s;tate of their minds rai&s;ed them nearly to lunacy, &mdash;for to receive death calmly, they &s;uppo&s;ed

<HEAD>THE FAIR SOLITARY, OR, FEMALE HERMIT. A NOVEL.</HEAD>
<P>AT a vi&s;it Alicia, and &s;ome ladies of her acquaintance, paid Belinda at her country &s;eat, a motion was made to put the hor&s;es to the coach and take an airing. The &s;ea&s;on of the year admitted of getting out early, and their journey was to a meadow by a river &s;ide, with a large wood at the end. On one &s;ide of this wood was a pretty &s;teep rock, on the top of which &s;tood an hermitage, and at the foot of the rock ran a pretty broad &s;tream, which &s;eemed to forbid a farther pa&s;|&s;age. This water ri&s;es from a torrent, which falls from the hill on the rocks. The mur|muring noi&s;e it makes, together with the natural ca&s;cades it forms, in the gloom of the wood, pre&s;ents the eye with as agreeable an entertainment as the mo&s;t cultivated &s;pot of ground can do.</P>
<P>"This is my u&s;ual walk, &s;ays Belinda, I like the &s;ilence of the place. It in&s;pires a &s;oothing melancholy. Hither I often repair
<PB N="4" REF="022876_0206_0FBA9C910394E2A8">
alone, or without any company but my thoughts."</P>
<P>"But do you never meet with the Hermit, and have you not yet ventured into his habi|tation," &s;aid one of the ladies? "I have not had a &s;ight of him yet, an&s;wered &s;he."</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Alicia, I love the&s;e hermits, and &s;hould be glad of a little talk with one of them. A way of life &s;o much out of the common cour&s;e makes me fancy, that they mu&s;t needs be either va&s;tly &s;uperior to, or very much below other men.</P>
<P>Here the company alighted, and walked over a green, clo&s;e by the &s;ide of a brook. On going further they came to a place, where the tall poplars which grew on the banks of the river hung very much over, and by their bending formed a kind of a bridge, at the foot of which appeared a &s;mall path in the rock, by which the a&s;cent was ea&s;y to the top; but whether made by nature, or con|trived by art, is uncertain.</P>
<P>The ladies, guided by their curio&s;ity, fol|lowed this &s;mall track, and &s;oon got to the door of the hermitage. They &s;aw at the &s;ame time a tall hand&s;ome woman ha&s;tily enter this rural habitation, and pull the wicket after her; upon which, &s;aid they, &s;ince women are admitted here, we may al&s;o claim the &s;ame right. Accordingly they knocked at the door, but nobody would an&s;wer. Con|tinuing however to make a loud noi&s;e, and giving thereby to under&s;tand that they would
<PB N="5" REF="022876_0207_0FBA9C91E1DB82D0">
not be denied, the &s;ame per&s;on they had &s;een before, came out, and told them, her little dwelling was not worthy the notice of ladies of their fa&s;hion. They made an&s;wer, that their bu&s;ine&s;s was with the Hermit who lived there, and that they mu&s;t &s;ee him; upon which the woman, perceiving it would be in vain to make any further re&s;i&s;tance, opened the door, but at the &s;ame time told them that they would find nobody there but her&s;elf. The company &s;tepped in ha&s;tily, and having &s;oon looked over the little cot|tage, which was plain and homely, but neat, were indeed much &s;urpri&s;ed to find no other per&s;on but the woman.</P>
<P>"Our curio&s;ity increa&s;es, &s;ays Belinda: How can you live here by your&s;elf? What an odd &s;ort of life is this for a woman, and what could make you embrace it? The more I view you, the more my a&s;toni&s;hment in|crea&s;es. By your age and appearance you &s;eem unfit for &s;o wild a dwelling, you might be an ornament to cities."&mdash;And indeed through a dejected air, and a &s;weet mode&s;t countenance, &s;he di&s;covered much beauty. "Alas! replied the Solitary, I am unable to an&s;wer &s;uch compliments. I am almo&s;t a &s;tranger to the u&s;ual language of the world, neither have I, during four years abode in this retreat, &s;een or conver&s;ed with any hu|man creature."&mdash;Who then &s;upplies you with the nece&s;&s;aries of life? a&s;ked they.&mdash; "A young woman, returned &s;he, who had
<PB N="6" REF="022876_0208_0FBA9C935156C438">
an affection for me, would fain have accom|panied me hither, but, having a family, &s;he could not leave it. However &s;he is &s;ettled in a neighbouring town, whence &s;he brings me twice a week more than is &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of a life, which I wi&s;h I had, and which I ought to have lo&s;t long ago."</P>
<P>The&s;e words were followed by a flood of tears, which, together with her appearance and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;oon gained her the compa&s;&s;ion of her fair gue&s;ts, "In &s;eeing you, cried they, it is impo&s;&s;ible to avoid pitying you, whil&s;t the intere&s;t we take in your misfortunes in|titles us to their recital. Let their cau&s;e be what it will, we &s;hall &s;till pity you. If you are wretched through the fault of others, we will join in your re&s;entment; if by your own, fortune only &s;hall be to blame, and you &s;hall never appear guilty in our eyes."</P>
<P>"Your indulgence and good-nature, la|dies, replied &s;he, will not reconcile me to my|&s;elf. I have quitted the world to &s;hun my own being, but am &s;till always pre&s;ent to my&s;elf. I thought that, when I &s;hould no longer have witne&s;&s;es to my follies, I might then po&s;&s;ibly forgive and forget them. But, mer|cile&s;s to my&s;elf, I am ever condemning and puni&s;hing them. The &s;ilence of the&s;e woods brings them fre&s;her to my mind, and adds new feeling to their &s;ting. Di&s;engaged from all things el&s;e, they alone are the employment of my whole lei&s;ure time.&mdash;"Perhaps, fair lady," re&s;umed Alicia, "it is an over delica|cy
<PB N="7" REF="022876_0209_0FBA9C94D8E02DE8">
only that makes you thus cruel to your&s;elf. However, you cannot well refu&s;e the recital of your misfortunes to people that already take &s;o large a &s;hare in them."</P>
<P>She would have excu&s;ed her&s;elf, but the ladies, who&s;e curio&s;ity was greatly rai&s;ed, a&s;&s;uring her they would not leave her till &s;he had acquainted them with her unfortunate hi&s;tory. She began thus.</P>
<P>"Since then, ladies, you in&s;i&s;t upon it, I &s;hall give you a plain narrative of my life, in which, though I may not have the merit of appearing innocent in your eyes, I &s;hall at lea&s;t have that of being &s;incere.&mdash;I am born of a noble family. My father had the happine&s;s of having &s;erved his king and coun|try well in many important occa&s;ions, and enjoyed great places at court; but, meeting afterwards with &s;ome inju&s;tice in having a ri|val preferred to a po&s;t he thought his due, he grew highly di&s;gu&s;ted. At that very time he had done the king of S&mdash;a con&s;ider|able piece of &s;ervice, &s;o that, thinking all his obligations to his country, and an un|grateful prince, cancelled by the unju&s;t treat|ment he had met with, he engaged in a re|bellion that was rai&s;ed again&s;t him. As he had the chief command in a great province, it was an ea&s;y matter for him to bring about a change of ma&s;ters among&s;t the people of his government; he was very indifferent about making terms for him&s;elf. The &s;er|vices he was doing the cau&s;e, and a large
<PB N="8" REF="022876_0210_0FBA9C99C54FFC40">
province he was &s;ubduing, were his ho&s;tages and &s;ecurities for the promi&s;es they made him, whil&s;t on our part we had nothing but bare words to depend upon. In the mean while all our e&s;tates and preferments were forfeited; in lieu of which we had only fine promi&s;es, which were but indifferently per|formed. I was then very young, had lo&s;t my mother, and was the delight of my fa|ther. I had an only brother, &s;ome years older than my&s;elf, who went to the army with my father, and learned the art of war under his direction.</P>
<P>As for my&s;elf, I was to be &s;ent to one of tho&s;e hou&s;es that are de&s;tined for the educa|tion of young ladies, but the prince&s;s Zaide, who&s;e hu&s;band had formerly commanded in our province, being very intimate with my father, begged of him to leave me with her, which he con&s;ented to. This lady was fond of children, they were her chief diver&s;ion, and &s;he had but one &s;on. I was brought up with as much care as if I had been her own daughter: &s;he appointed me governe&s;&s;es and proper ma&s;ters, who cultivated all my good inclinations. She took a kind of plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement in dre&s;&s;ing me, and often gave little entertainments to the young children of my age. I had the good luck to plea&s;e in them, and always &s;trove to out-do even what was thought well in the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The prince Camillus (that was her &s;on's name) was &s;ome years older than I. He
<PB N="9" REF="022876_0211_0FBA9C9B92A73CF0">
had a noble and graceful per&s;on. We lived together, and whenever he had done with his ma&s;ters, he would &s;eek my company with great fondne&s;s. In all his actions he gave me a remarkable preference over my companions. As I advanced in age, the graces, I am told, were not wholly unmindful of my per&s;on, and his liking to me increa&s;ed every day. I too early experienced the plea&s;ure of being loved, and found a &s;atisfaction in it. It is an unhappy thing to contract &s;uch an habit from our infancy.</P>
<P>Prince Camillus's friends had de&s;igned him for the duke of * * *'s daughter. Her name was Valeria: &s;he was the heire&s;s of the fa|mily, &s;o that an ample fortune and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed titles made her a match worthy of him. He was often conducted to pay his court to her; &s;he likewi&s;e came to wait on the old prince&s;s, and we often met together at our little plays and entertainments. She was hand&s;ome, and could not bear the re|markable preference our young lover gave me: in revenge &s;he would often reflect with &s;corn and contempt on my fortune; but the prince's commendations and my gla&s;s made me perfectly ea&s;y; for I was already of an age to find a &s;atisfaction in being hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>His reluctance to vi&s;it the lady Valeria &s;oon grew remarkable. Hitherto we had lived together without any manner of con|&s;traint and his attachment to me had been looked upon as of no con&s;equence; but as
<PB N="10" REF="022876_0212_0FBA9C9D0FF991B0">
it increa&s;ed every day, it began to grow &s;e|rious, and he was therefore forbid to enter my apartment.</P>
<P>His love quickened by this prohibition. He grew &s;ad and melancholy; and as he was of a hot and fiery temper, the re&s;traint that was laid upon his inclinations acted upon his health in &s;uch a manner, that he fell &s;ick. His mother was greatly alarmed at the acci|dent. Valeria too came &s;everal times to vi&s;it him, but he paid her regard with &s;o much coldne&s;s, that &s;he was prodigiou&s;ly nettled at the return. In the mean while his illne&s;s gained &s;o much upon him, that other con&s;i|derations were laid a&s;ide to apply to the &s;aving of his life. He was therefore allowed to &s;ee me, and I was accordingly conducted to his apartment by the women who had the care of me. The &s;ight of me had a &s;peedier effect upon him than all the art of the phy|&s;icians, and his health returned in proportion to the liberty he had of being in my com|pany. His mother, however, was revenged on me for the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was reduced to of allowing an intercour&s;e, the con&s;equences of which were &s;o much dreaded. She no longer retained the &s;ame tender friend&s;hip for me; the commendations that were be|&s;towed on me, and with which &s;he was for|merly &s;o well plea&s;ed, now grew offen&s;ive to her, and I was often puni&s;hed for being liked too much.</P>
<P>The prince, having at la&s;t perfectly reco|vered
<PB N="11" REF="022876_0213_0FBA9C9EF2884F50">
his health, became in a &s;hort time the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed lord in the court. He began now to a&s;&s;ume an air of haughtine&s;s and independance, and &s;light the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his ma&s;ters, but retained &s;till an infinite re&s;pect for his mother; though I was the li|mit of his obedience. He obeyed her in every thing except in what related to me.</P>
<P>At length &s;he expo&s;tulated the matter one day with him, and a&s;ked what he meant at la&s;t to do by his attachment for me? "Every thing, madam, an&s;wered he; for when I meet with birth, virtue and beauty in the object of my affections, I think I may, with|out blu&s;hing, own my pa&s;&s;ion and further intentions." So &s;mart and re&s;olute an an|&s;wer made her tremble; &s;he repre&s;ented to him the great di&s;tance there was between him and me, the mis<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">unes of my family, the lo&s;s of our preferment and the forfeiture of our e&s;tates; to all which he replied, "There fortune only is to blame, not &s;he; and may you not too, madam, be a little in fault, to &s;et &s;o high a value on that &s;ort of advantages which do not depend on us?"&mdash; But, an&s;wered the prince&s;s, "you find in Valeria both tho&s;e you are taken with, and the others you reproach me with making too great an account of." Oh, madam! re|plied the young prince, my heart and your eyes are widely different in their judgments. You &s;ee, but I feel; and whatever inequa|lity
<PB N="12" REF="022876_0214_0FBA9CA091759AC0">
there is between per&s;ons, love brings them all to a level."</P>
<P>The prince&s;s now &s;aw that there was no time to be lo&s;t, but that I mu&s;t be &s;ent out of the way, and accordingly I was put into a hou&s;e de&s;igned for a retreat from the world. The prince was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of the news, but he flew to the place, and threat|ened the per&s;ons appointed for my keepers to have recour&s;e to the la&s;t extremities, if they did not produce me. His menaces were of no effect; they per&s;i&s;ted in their re|fu&s;al, and prote&s;ted they would let no body &s;ee me without an order from the prince&s;s, his mother. He went to her next, and &s;poke with a tran&s;port of heat, which offended her. He &s;aid, that he was not obliged to her for a life &s;he was endeavouring to make &s;o wretched; that the happine&s;s of his days would be to unit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s fortune with mine, and that her power did not extend to an empire over the mind; and, upon her attempting to &s;et before him her authority and his duty, he told her &s;martly, that the heart had rights and dues of its own apart from all others.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s was prudent; &s;he &s;aw it would be in vain to &s;truggle again&s;t the &s;tream, and therefore told him that &s;he would &s;acrifice her ju&s;t re&s;entment to her regard for him; that &s;he looked upon him as a per&s;on out of order, who claimed her pity; but that he could not refu&s;e her to be &s;ix months with|out &s;eeing me, &s;ince &s;uch a compliance would
<PB N="13" REF="022876_0215_0FBA9CA2FB4F45F8">
co&s;t him the le&s;s, as the campaign was ap|proaching, and he mu&s;t &s;et out to take upon him the command of the troops the king had thought fit to tru&s;t him with; and that &s;he was per&s;uaded the pa&s;&s;ion that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, had not quite extingui&s;hed the love of glory in his &s;oul.&mdash;This, indeed, was true; never man enjoyed tho&s;e two &s;entiments in a higher degree; neither did the one in the lea&s;t take from the other.</P>
<P>He could not well deny the prince&s;s, but a&s;&s;ured her withal that his pa&s;&s;ion was not to be le&s;&s;ened by time, and that reflection, which never fails curing ordinary flames, would but increa&s;e his.</P>
<P>Whatever he could &s;ay to the contrary, &s;he was &s;till in hopes that time and ab&s;ence would do much for her, and therefore now bent her thoughts on endeavouring to divert one idea by another. She procured him a mo&s;t mag|nificent equipage, and provided for his re|tinue the mo&s;t pompous attendants that could be found, and joined to the&s;e &s;everal old officers who had behaved be&s;t in the king's &s;ervice, to train him up to greatne&s;s. No|thing was forgotten that might in&s;pire him with the love of glory, and, as he had a va&s;t &s;hare of honor, he did not he&s;itate to em|brace a cour&s;e &s;o much becoming his birth. He prepared therefore to &s;et out for the army, where his &s;en&s;e of glory was equalled by the &s;hining opportunities he had to pur&s;ue it.</P>
<P>A young man of merit who belonged to

his retinue &s;oon became his confidante. He was born of a good family, and could take the liberty of often di&s;cour&s;ing him about his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and pitying his being abandoned to a pa&s;&s;ion, which, as it di&s;tracted his mother, &s;o it might likewi&s;e ca&s;t a &s;tain upon his own reputation. Love, he told him, was not ju&s;tifiable in great men till they had paid the tribute due to glory, and that it might indeed be a &s;tate of pa&s;&s;age in the life of an hero, but that glory was a qualification that claimed a la&s;ting place therein. "De&s;cended from the blood you &s;pring from, continued he, and with the merit you po&s;&s;e&s;s, you have va&s;t expectations of courage and magnanimity to an&s;wer."</P>
<P>This was in vain, he was not to be heard yet. The prince was abandoned to a de&s;pair, from which every thing might be feared. He had often repaired to the place of my confinement, and, not having been able to obtain a &s;ight of me, had with difficulty been with-held from the la&s;t violences. His confidante Timander, who &s;oothed his an|gui&s;h by his gentlene&s;s, and the complai&s;ant di&s;charge of the tru&s;t he placed in him, pro|mi&s;ed him at la&s;t to bring me a letter from him. Accordingly he waited on the prin|ce&s;s, and repre&s;ented to her, that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to compound a little with the prince's grief; that were &s;he to in&s;i&s;t upon a &s;trict compliance with her orders, and exact obe|dience with too much rigour, &s;he might
<PB N="15" REF="022876_0217_0FBA9CA5D47B39A0">
drive him to the greate&s;t extremities; that &s;he ought not to put her power in competi|tion with the force of love, nor &s;et up her rights again&s;t tho&s;e of the heart, for neither were to be controuled by authority; that the prince ought to be pitied and diverted by &s;ome great object, without being made &s;en&s;ible of their de&s;ign; and that in exalted and haughty &s;ouls there were great re&s;ources to be found to work them to our ends. He concluded by accquainting her, that the prince had de&s;ired him to bring me a letter, that he was accordingly come to receive her orders, and that as to him&s;elf, &s;he might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured &s;he had nothing to fear from the confidence her &s;on placed in him.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s having yielded to the&s;e argu|ments, Timander came and found me me|lancholy and thoughtful. Your beauty, ma|dam, &s;aid he, makes &s;trange work already. Is this the fir&s;t trial of your &s;kill? I gave him no an&s;wer, but what he could read in my confu&s;ed countenance and ba&s;hful looks: however, continued he, here is a letter the prince has ordered me to deliver into your hands.&mdash;I mu&s;t not take it, &s;aid I, and am extremely &s;orry for the effect, what you are plea&s;ed to call, beauty has had upon him. I know what I am, and at how great a di&s;tance the misfortunes of my family place me from him. I am bound by the ties of gratitude and re&s;pect to the prince&s;s, his mother; and if my eyes have had the misfortune to plea&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="022876_0218_0FBA9CA791AFB9A8">
him, my heart has had no &s;hare in the de|&s;ign. Therefore tell him I be&s;eech him to forget me. Timander here again pre&s;&s;ed me to receive the billet he had obtained leave to bring me; and the per&s;on, who&s;e care I was under, bidding me take and read it, I accordingly opened it, and found the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"Nothing, madam, but the pa&s;&s;ion you have in&s;pired in me can exceed the affliction I am under. Expre&s;&s;ions are too poor for what I feel. You are per&s;ecuted for my &s;ake, and your &s;ufferings alone cau&s;e all the tortures that di&s;tract me. I now di&s;cover my love without di&s;gui&s;e or re&s;erve, a boldne&s;s I bor|row from the innocence of my intentions; and as every thing oppo&s;es my de&s;igns, my de&s;ires become the more inflamed, and my re&s;olutions the better confirmed. Are not you formed, madam, to be loved? In you I find all my excu&s;es.&mdash;When a man loves as much as I do, the greate&s;t plea&s;ure he can feel, is to find that he loves with the ju&s;te&s;t rea&s;on; and this, madam, is a &s;atisfaction I mu&s;t owe you all the moments of my life."</P>
<P>Well, madam, &s;ays Timander, will you not favour us with an an&s;wer to this billet? &mdash;I do not think it at all proper, an&s;wered I.&mdash;Why &s;o, added he, you are not forbid it? &mdash;My duty to my&s;elf, returned I, forbids it.</P>
<P>After an hour's conver&s;ation he took his leave, and de&s;ired to know what he &s;hould tell the prince? Tell him, &s;aid I, that I have a grateful heart, and am moved with
<PB N="17" REF="022876_0219_0FBA9CAA43258EA8">
his &s;orrow; but that, in the circum&s;tances we are in, the be&s;t thing for him to do is, to think no more of me, and for me to forget him, if I can. He went back to the prince with this an&s;wer, which did not &s;eem to di&s;|plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>Returning to my chamber, I read the prince's letter over again with a concern of tenderne&s;s, which would have given him the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction. Not long after this me&s;|&s;age, I heard he was upon his departure for the army. His mother had procured him the mo&s;t &s;plendid equipage in the world, and purcha&s;ed him one of the fir&s;t po&s;ts in the army. She was, by this, opening a door to honors, and he was &s;etting out with di&s;|tinction in the road to glory. Timander called once more upon me before his depar|ture, and brought this &s;econd letter.</P>
<P>"I am departing for the army, madam. I mu&s;t an&s;wer the call of glory to reach the throne of love, and become worthy of you. I therefore fancy you are the prize I am going to conquer.&mdash;But alas! love is not to be merited, and I mu&s;t abandon my&s;elf to a grief worthy of your ab&s;ence and my heart. Do but think, madam, that I am without you; that will be &s;ufficient to de&s;erve your pity.&mdash;I would &s;acrifice my life to my evil &s;tars, but that I know it is con&s;ecrated to you, and love will claim an account of it at my hands."</P>
<P>Timander painted, in the livelie&s;t colours,
<PB N="18" REF="022876_0220_0FBA9CAB502AAFE8">
the di&s;tre&s;s the prince was in. The picture affected me prodigiou&s;ly. I felt my bo&s;om rent by a thou&s;and different agitations. I thought my&s;elf va&s;tly indebted to him: I had hopes, fears, and even de&s;ires; yet all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were not well di&s;tingui&s;hed in my &s;oul. I was flattered with the prince's love; but then again I was too much re|minded of the di&s;tance between him and me. This &s;tartled my pride, and, when &s;elf-opi|nion took up the &s;cales to weigh our merits, I own I did not find my&s;elf &s;o va&s;tly beneath him. It is true, I might indeed have renounc|ed an alliance I was made to buy at too high a price, but in the attempt the prince's love and di&s;tre&s;s &s;topped me &s;hort.&mdash;He was &s;a|crificing his greatne&s;s to me, and I my pride to him. He had not been long in the army before he gave proofs of his bravery. In him courage was joined with a great &s;hare of &s;en&s;e and prudence (though the latter was &s;till confined to his head, and had not yet reached his heart) whil&s;t reading and reflection &s;up|plied his want of experience; all which gave rea&s;on to hope he would one day be a great general.</P>
<P>There was a great battle fought a few days after his arrival. The enemies finding them|&s;elves hard pre&s;&s;ed in the po&s;t they occupied, and fearing to be attacked in their intrench|ments, re&s;olved to be beforehand with us. Accordingly having made all the previous di&s;po&s;itions to a battle, they fell upon us at
<PB N="19" REF="022876_0221_0FBA9CAE03F89230">
a time, when by their &s;ituation we would have thought they &s;hould only have kept on the defen&s;ive. However they came up like de&s;peradoes, determined to &s;ell dearly their lives, and victory had long remained doubt|ful, when the left wing, which my father commanded, began at la&s;t to give way. The prince, who was at the head of the infantry, flew immediately to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He found him wounded, fallen under his hor&s;e, and all about him either dead, or put to flight. He ran to him, lifted him from the ground, re-mounted him on a &s;pare hor&s;e, bound up his wound with his handerchief, and rallying the troops, charged bri&s;kly the enemy, routed them entirely, and obtained a complete vic|tory, which co&s;t them all their artillery and baggage, be&s;ides a great number of pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>My father began to feel his hurt after he was out of the heat of the action, and was obliged to be carried to his tent, where the &s;urgeons &s;earched his wound, and found it very con&s;iderable. The fir&s;t thing he did was, to enquire after the per&s;on to whom he owed his life, and being told that it was the prince who had thus &s;aved him, he could not conquer his concern for being &s;o greatly obliged to him: is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, that I mu&s;t be &s;o infinitely in his debt? All the time of his illne&s;s, the prince never cea&s;ed his generous offices; he &s;ent for the mo&s;t emi|nent &s;urgeons to dre&s;s his wound; had his
<PB N="20" REF="022876_0222_0FBA9CAF0ECE4C68">
own officers to wait on him, and more than once offered him his pur&s;e, which he con|&s;tantly refu&s;ed to accept. Word was &s;ent me of my father's wound, how I owed his life to the prince, and of all the kind offices he had received from him during his illne&s;s. On this, the infinite regard and affection I had for &s;o dear a parent, made me think I might &s;end the prince my acknowledgments, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing again&s;t the rules or decen|cy. Accordingly, without con&s;ulting any body, I wrote him the following letter.</P>
<P>"I don't think I tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of decency, by thus expre&s;&s;ing the grateful &s;en&s;e of my obligations to you for having pre&s;erv|ed a life &s;o precious to me as is that of a fa|ther, whom I honor beyond all expre&s;&s;ion. &mdash;Alas! Sir, mu&s;t e&s;teem, gratitude, and natural &s;entiments, all join to force a heart, which would have cho&s;en to yield only to its inclination and your tenderne&s;s? Fame is al|ready wholly taken up with you. For this am I to thank glory alone, and mu&s;t not love claim &s;ome &s;hare of the debt?"</P>
<P>I feared a long while for my father's life; but at la&s;t he gave &s;ome hopes of a recovery, to ha&s;ten which he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be car|ried into the country, whither I followed im|mediately to wait on him, and employ my cares for a health that was &s;o dear to me.</P>
<P>The prince returned covered with glory. He often came in a friendly manner to vi&s;it my father, and I found him &s;till the &s;ame
<PB N="21" REF="022876_0223_0FBA9CB1977E86C0">
towards me as when we parted. I acknow|ledged the obligations I lay under, and the &s;entiments of gratitude he could claim from me; but the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions offended him. I mu&s;t have no returns but from your heart, &s;aid he: delicacy of &s;entiments is an attendant of love, which quickens all its plea&s;ures, though it often prepares us many vexations. But what mu&s;t become of me, if with &s;enti|ments &s;o natural, &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o fond as mine, you &s;hould not an&s;wer them, and I could in&s;pire you with nothing but thoughts of gratitude?&mdash;Yet, replied I, I mu&s;t not entertain any others.</P>
<P>There began now to be &s;ome talk of peace, and the prince, notwith&s;tanding his youth, held &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a rank, that he was cal|led into all the con&s;ultations held upon that &s;ubject. They ended at la&s;t in a general pa|cification, and the prince took particular care to have my father included in the treaty. Accordingly, by virtue of a general amne&s;ty, and a &s;eparate article for our family, our e&s;tates were to be re&s;tored to us as well as the places my father held before the war, which he was left at liberty either to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of again, or to accept of an equivalent in lieu thereof.</P>
<P>My father's health returned with the &s;atis|faction of once more &s;eeing his family in a flouri&s;hing condition. The peace occa&s;ioned an univer&s;al joy throughout the kingdom, and nothing was thought of at court, but
<PB N="22" REF="022876_0224_0FBA9CB2EAD3EDA0">
the celebrating of it by fe&s;tivals and rejoic|ings. My father now left the country to take a hou&s;e in town, and &s;et up an equipage &s;uitable to his birth. As I was already pa&s;|&s;ed my childhood, he took me home, but de&s;ired a lady of his acquaintance, who had lo&s;t her hu&s;band, and had &s;uffered from the frowns of fortune, to come and live with us, and have an eye over my conduct. Her name was Leonora: I was ordered to &s;how her as much obedience as if &s;he were my mother: &s;he had a great &s;hare of under|&s;tanding, had &s;een the world, and took care that I did not &s;tir a &s;tep without her.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after I was pre&s;ented to the queen. Her maje&s;ty received me with great kindne&s;s, treated me with di&s;tinction, and &s;aid very hand&s;ome things of my per&s;on.</P>
<P>The whole winter &s;ea&s;on was &s;pent in di|ver&s;ions. The queen was young, and had a ta&s;te for plea&s;ures. There was not an a&s;&s;em|bly but what &s;he was &s;o kind as to admit me into, and I &s;howed away with pretty good &s;ucce&s;s. Prince Camillus made likewi&s;e one at every ball that was given. He danced exceeding well; his per&s;on was above any Lord's at court, and the glory he had acquir|ed in the late campaign, &s;eemed to ca&s;t a new lu&s;tre on him. I had the &s;atisfaction of hearing him prai&s;ed, and he the plea&s;ure of finding his choice univer&s;ally approved. Whenever we were dancing together, bu&s;y whi&s;perings behind us declared how every
<PB N="23" REF="022876_0225_0FBA9CB5A34D5E68">
body agreed in pronouncing us made for one another.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s Valeria bore with impatience the figure I made at court, and the queen's kindne&s;s to me, but much more the prince's fondne&s;s. She fell into &s;o deep a melancholy, that I could not help pitying her condition. Her pa&s;&s;ion glowed in her eyes; a &s;ecret lan|guor was &s;pread over her whole per&s;on; grief preyed upon her beauty; and, though Nature intended her fair, Love had now ordered it otherwi&s;e. She had hand&s;ome features, but a wan and pale look robbed them of all their charms.</P>
<P>She comforted her&s;elf by ea&s;ing her mind to a young relation who lived with her, and had her confidence. One day as I was walk|ing in the palace-garden with Leonora, we e&s;pied the prince&s;s and her confidante enter|ing into a pretty dark grove, upon which I propo&s;ed to my friend to follow them. Ac|cordingly we &s;tept after, and entered a &s;ide alley next to that where &s;he was &s;itting with her companion. She &s;poke with heat enough to be heard. What &s;aid &s;he, would you have me do with my&s;elf? I live but for him, and yet I &s;hall never gain his love.&mdash;Forgive him this piece of levity, &s;aid the other, he will &s;oon return to you. How? replied Valeria, you would have me not concerned at his u&s;age! And you call levity a natural pa&s;&s;ion which he cannot re&s;i&s;t! A pa&s;&s;ion, to which he &s;acrifices his love to me, his glory, his
<PB N="24" REF="022876_0226_0FBA9CB692971050">
fortune, and all he owes to the be&s;t of mo|thers! My heart has too often found his ex|cu&s;es: when we love, we forgive long; but you do not &s;ee him with eyes as intere&s;ted as mine. What cold in&s;en&s;ibility has he not &s;hown for my pains!&mdash;There is a kind of meanne&s;s in feeling and &s;uffering for tho&s;e that do not feel for us. I can no longer bear the rackings of my heart, and the &s;ting|ing reproaches of my pride; I mu&s;t, I will &s;ilence them, and fall upon &s;ome method worthy of me. What may that be? an&s;wered her relation. Why, to retire for ever from court, replied &s;he;&mdash;&s;he could not proceed further, a flood of tears interrupting her &s;peech.&mdash;Strange re&s;olution! an&s;wered her confidante; you would puni&s;h your&s;elf, be|cau&s;e another is guilty! Here night coming on, they withdrew.</P>
<P>I &s;eemed &s;o affected with the prince&s;s's af|fection, that Leonora could not help expre&s;|&s;ing her &s;urpri&s;e. What! &s;aid &s;he to me, mu&s;t one enter into a rival's grief?&mdash;I never feared her, replied I, and, as I have had nothing to di&s;pute with her, I cannot now enjoy the ill-natured plea&s;ure of triumphing in her di&s;tre&s;s. The prince's heart was ten|dered me without my wi&s;hing or de&s;iring it, and therefore, as &s;he gives me neither fear nor unea&s;ine&s;s, I cannot hate her. I have &s;ome &s;hare of good-nature, and mu&s;t pity her condition.</P>
<P>At my return home I found one of the
<PB N="25" REF="022876_0227_0FBA9CBA5AA47AF8">
queen's gentlemen, who brought me word, that &s;he had engaged me to an entertainment the king was to give, on account of the mar|riage of the prince&s;s Flavia, one of her ma|je&s;ty's relations; that in ca&s;e I had not jewels enough, &s;he would &s;end me &s;ome, and de|&s;ired to know what I might want. I told him, I had a &s;uit of green velvet and gold, which would do very well with a &s;et of rubies, if I could get them. I withdrew afterwards to prepare my dre&s;s, and, out of complai|&s;ance to her maje&s;ty, took more pains about it than otherwi&s;e I would have done.</P>
<P>The day appointed for this magnificent en|tertainment was &s;pent in all manner of di|ver&s;ions. There was a play acted in the even|ing, which was followed by a grand &s;upper and a ball; and nothing in the world could be more gallant and better conducted. The prince&s;s Flavia looked perfectly charming: for, though &s;he is not a regular beauty, &s;he has &s;o much youth and bloom, with &s;o beau|tiful a colour, that &s;he may &s;urpa&s;s others hand&s;omer than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>About the middle of the ball there was a great &s;tir at the door, which engaged the at|tention and eyes of the whole company. It was the duke of Praxede who was ju&s;t arri|ving from the army. His coming was quite unexpected; he had made a &s;hining campaign, had beaten the enemy, and entered the room with an air of confidence, &s;upported by his na|tural valour and good mien. I had never
<PB N="26" REF="022876_0228_0FBA9CBD3A52FC08">
&s;een him before: he was not better acquaint|ed with me; and, in ca&s;ting his eyes towards me, I heard him &s;ay &s;ome very fine things. His words, his looks, and the very found of his voice threw my &s;oul into an agitation, which I had never felt before. The prince and he were then at variance; they were both driv|ing towards the &s;ame goal, and each other's rivals in glory and merit; upon which ac|count they had been &s;eparated, and the court had not thought fit to employ them both in the &s;ame army.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he arrived, the prince&s;s Flavia offered him her hand to dance: he took me next, but I was &s;o confu&s;ed, that had I dared, I would have refu&s;ed his civility.</P>
<P>All the time the ball la&s;ted, he kept his eyes con&s;tantly on me: I turned mine from him, and would fain refu&s;e him my looks, as a favour he had no right to. However he took me &s;everal times to dance, and made him&s;elf &s;o remarkable, that it was thought he did it on purpo&s;e to &s;pite the prince. You may be &s;ure I had no &s;hare in the de&s;ign, and indeed, as &s;oon as the ball was over, I ran home in great ha&s;te, and the prince left the company to conduct me.</P>
<P>"Your charms, madam, &s;aid he, (when at liberty to &s;peak) operate on every body, and the duke of Praxede comes to &s;well the number of your conque&s;ts. Indeed, Sir, re|plied I, his affecting to take me &s;o often to dance, and his &s;taring at me has given me
<PB N="27" REF="022876_0229_0FBA9CBE15942798">
a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;But why &s;o, ma|dam? an&s;wered her. So much care, never to ca&s;t a look towards him, &s;hows that you dread|ed his eyes, and was diffident of your own. A per&s;on that feels nothing, is always free and open; and over-acting our part, on certain occa&s;ions, often betrays a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of not being always right.&mdash;But, re|plied I, what would you quarrel with me about? I never &s;aw him before in my life.&mdash; That may be, an&s;wered he again, but he has has &s;een you, and you were hand&s;omer than u&s;ual to-day: nay, he loves you, and that alone, even though you were not guilty, is enough to make me wretched."</P>
<P>Ever after this the prince watched me with a caution that gave me offence. The duke on his part followed me every where, and I always found him ready to catch my looks in all public places. The prince was informed of all his &s;teps; he became peevi&s;h and &s;u&s;picious, and, though he could lay nothing to my charge, yet he was not &s;atis|fied with me. He thought the duke very in&s;olent to pretend to a per&s;on, to whom he had been &s;o long engaged; but for my part, I own I fancied he wanted only to teaze and alarm the prince, and believed, that, he thought if I could not &s;erve the purpo&s;e of his heart, I might at lea&s;t gratify his vanity. Such a notion was highly offen&s;ive to me, and therefore I &s;hunned him carefully. The prince him&s;elf took notice of this; where|upon
<PB N="28" REF="022876_0230_0FBA9CBF92F86260">
I opened my mind to him one day, telling him I could not believe I was any ways concerned in his grief, &s;ince, were it &s;o, it would be doing me the highe&s;t in|ju&s;tice; to which he an&s;wered, "You do not indeed &s;eem to join with the duke again&s;t me; you avoid him, and &s;how me even a greater regard than ever, and yet you are guilty: nay, you are &s;o without knowing it, and you would fain, by an increa&s;e of kindne&s;s, make amends for the wrongs you are doing me.&mdash;Good Heavens, cried I, what then is my crime!&mdash;You love the duke, an&s;wered he: yes, Mademoi&s;elle, you doat on him, and 'tis I that mu&s;t inform you thereof, I know I am going to appear whim&s;i|cal and ridiculous, and ju&s;tify all your wrongs. I provide you with weapons again&s;t my&s;elf, which you will turn to a proper u&s;e. I &s;ee and feel the whole of my wretchedne&s;s, but I am driven to it." All this was attended by a flood of tears, and taking leave he told me further, that he was going to conceal his di&s;traction and de&s;pair from my &s;ight.</P>
<P>He left me in a greater confu&s;ion than I can well de&s;cribe: I found I wanted to &s;hake off my&s;elf, and dur&s;t not yet enquire into the cau&s;e of the various emotions, I felt rai&s;ed in my brea&s;t; when having thrown my&s;elf on a couch, Leonora entered the room.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed at her coming, and a&s;hamed &s;he &s;hould be witne&s;s of my di&s;order. Which
<PB N="29" REF="022876_0231_0FBA9CC110F80E20">
&s;he perceiving, Come, &s;aid &s;he, recover your&s;elf: I &s;ee you would conceal your un|ea&s;ine&s;s and &s;entiments from my knowledge; but you are to blame. Don't take me for a &s;evere cen&s;or, that would condemn all your motions, but look upon me as a friend on whom you may depend, and one capable of comforting and conducting you in the mo&s;t delicate circum&s;tance of your life. Do not fancy I &s;hall make a crime of your &s;en&s;ibi|lity. A heart may be &s;en&s;ible and innocent too; and, to merit your confidence, by my example, I am willing to let you into mine." Here &s;he pau&s;ed a while, and &s;eemed to re|pent having gone &s;o far; but I pre&s;&s;ed her with &s;o much tenderne&s;s to proceed in her &s;tory, that &s;he continued thus:</P>
<P>I am acquainted with love, and have but too dearly paid the tribute due to that little god. You have no doubt heard of the mis|fortunes of my family, and how I lo&s;t my hu&s;band and brother both at the &s;ame time. The one was the &s;upport, and the other the hope of our hou&s;e. My brother was taken in arms again&s;t his &s;overeign, and left his head upon a &s;caffold. Soon after my hu&s;|band paid with his life a victory he gained over the enemies of the &s;tate. Thus was I in one moment &s;tript of all my pre&s;ent ad|vantages and hopes to come; reduced to lament a dead hu&s;band in place, and much e&s;teemed, and to &s;ue for a brother's life and honor: but, alas! he forfeited both toge|ther,
<PB N="30" REF="022876_0232_0FBA9CC5554AD228">
with his e&s;tates, &s;o that I was left with|out wealth or fortune. The notions of greatne&s;s di&s;appeared, and all the charms that are the attendants of a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;tation in life vani&s;hed in an in&s;tant. I found my&s;elf for&s;aken and without &s;upport, and my only hopes were, that, having been expo&s;ed to the frowns of fortune, I &s;hould at lea&s;t be forgotten by love; but both joined forces to per&s;ecute me. Di&s;pen&s;e me, madam, with the re&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>And now, ladies, though every thing &s;he &s;aid is &s;till fre&s;h in my memory, from my having been very attentive to this mark of confidence &s;he gave me (wherein &s;he acted very artfully to come at my heart and &s;ecret) yet as &s;he is unknown to you, the repetition will not perhaps be thought very material, therefore you will give me leave to drop her hi&s;tory here.&mdash;By no means, &s;aid we all, pray let us know the re&s;t of Leonora's adven|tures; whereupon the Solitary continued in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>&mdash;We like to be let into the weakne&s;&s;es of people we e&s;teem. We always long to re&s;emble them in &s;omething; if their emi|nent qualities leave us far behind, their foi|bles bring us to a nearer affinity. That is no &s;mall comfort, and in my particular cir|cum&s;tance, it was too important for my repo&s;e, to find a friend in a per&s;on who had been &s;et as a watch over my actions. The confi|dence &s;he was going to place in me, was a
<PB N="31" REF="022876_0233_0FBA9CC7397E3B30">
kind of &s;ecurity that an&s;wered for her, and I was in tho&s;e moments, when a &s;ecret lies &s;o heavy on the heart. I longed to &s;peak to her of what I felt, and was too happy to find in her, not only advices for my conduct, but the &s;ame dear weakne&s;&s;es which render us more indulgent towards tho&s;e of other peo|ple, I pre&s;&s;ed her therefore to proceed.</P>
<P>You will then, &s;aid &s;he, have the full extent of my &s;ecret. I am very much afraid the recital will make all my wounds bleed afre&s;h, and give new life to my pa&s;&s;ion; but howe|ever, that &s;hall not prevent my complying with your reque&s;t. My &s;entiments being the only plea&s;ure left me, I will indulge them in their full career. They are indeed of a quite new nature. Olindo in Ta&s;&s;o is quoted as a model of &s;entiments. He is made to &s;ay, that he de&s;ires much, hopes little, and a&s;ks nothing; but for my part I neither wi&s;h, hope, nor a&s;k at all. My pa&s;|&s;ion is &s;upported by nothing; it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, feeds, and increa&s;es by it&s;elf: and thus have I for a long time been taken up with a &s;enti|ment mo&s;t &s;ingular in its kind.</P>
<P>I &s;aw at a friend's &s;ome years ago the count ***, you will excu&s;e me telling his name. To me he appeared a mo&s;t amiable per&s;on, though, with &s;o great &s;hare of the qualifications of the mind, per&s;onal advan|tages would be le&s;s requi&s;ite. From the fir&s;t moment I beheld him he engaged my atten|tion, (which is doing a great deal with me)
<PB N="32" REF="022876_0234_0FBA9CC891A37CD8">
and I continued &s;eeing him both at my friend's and my own hou&s;e. There was at that time a gentleman that laid &s;ome preten|&s;ions to my heart. We had formerly been on the point of marriage, and, when my family had di&s;po&s;ed of my liberty in favour of my late hu&s;band, he had been afflicted beyond expre&s;&s;ion. His &s;tars had decreed he &s;hould ever love me; therefore, unable yet to re&s;olve to give me over, he &s;till di|verted his &s;orrow with the notion that my heart did not go along with my hand. His e&s;teem and re&s;pect for me had indeed &s;top|ped and repre&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments, but he was ever watching mine, and telling me every day, that, if I di&s;po&s;ed of them to another, he &s;hould die with grief.</P>
<P>He &s;oon ob&s;erved, that my regard for the count was changing into tenderne&s;s; my eyes had informed again&s;t me, and revealed my &s;ecret: and upon this he vented him|&s;elf in reproaches that very much offended me.</P>
<P>All this was yet unperceived by the hap|py man. Not but that he &s;eemed to have &s;ome &s;lender inclination for me, and I was ready prepared to reject his declaration, if he &s;hould make any. He has &s;ince been fully revenged for my idle re&s;olution. If he had any &s;entiments at all, they have &s;topt &s;hort, whil&s;t mine have had their full run. It was long before I could be clear in what I felt. Heavens! how artfully doth
<PB N="33" REF="022876_0235_0FBA9CCA36373620">
the heart in tho&s;e ca&s;es conceal its inclina|tion, not to alarm our rea&s;on and mode&s;ty? It is a bare nothing at fir&s;t: it is the mind we are taken with; and, in &s;hort, till love has got the ma&s;tery, he remains almo&s;t al|ways unknown. He &s;oon di&s;covered him&s;elf to me in all his power; and the di&s;order, which the pre&s;ence of the count always threw me into, made me &s;en&s;ible of my defeat.</P>
<P>About that time all my misfortunes came &s;howering upon me, and, as I have told you, I lo&s;t my hu&s;band and brother. It was the mo&s;t complete and &s;tronge&s;t felt di&s;tre&s;s in the world. My friend, who often came to comfort me, u&s;ed to bring the count with her at a time when I &s;aw no body; and I found, to the &s;hame of my grief, that he alone was able to &s;u&s;pend it.</P>
<P>I was afterwards plunged into a world of affairs; my family ruined; my brother pe|ri&s;hing with all the infamy of guilt and re|bellion, and none but I to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and &s;ave all I could out of the ruins of the fami|ly. I was in hopes that &s;o many troubles would at lea&s;t wear out the &s;entiment I nou|ri&s;hed in my heart, but my misfortunes ever kept up a &s;trong remembrance of it.</P>
<P>After many years vexation, time, with|out the help of rea&s;on, effected what the latter had not been able to compa&s;s; for we mu&s;t own, to the &s;hame of our affliction, that it doth not la&s;t for ever. In &s;hort, hav|ing made the mo&s;t of the wrecks of my
<PB N="34" REF="022876_0236_0FBA9CCBEE356438">
fortune, I hoped to enjoy a little quiet. But I had lo&s;t the repo&s;e of the heart, and, when re&s;tored to my&s;elf, I found I was wholly funk in love. An active hurrying life had, indeed, encroached on its rights; but I have paid dear for it &s;ince. I could no longer mi&s;take my &s;ituation; I was forced to own it, and begin to &s;ettle with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t women, void of thought or de&s;ign of action, are hurried away by the fir&s;t &s;en|timent that plea&s;es them. But for my part I con&s;idered what I had to do, and, after weighing the count's character and my own, found that I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely avoid him: and, to &s;how you that my re&s;olution was grounded on knowledge, I will draw you his picture.&mdash;But no; I am not in a condi|tion to paint him &s;uch as he is. Love would needs conduct the pencil, and I could not &s;uffer any want of merit in the object of my affections.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid I, interrupting her, how is it po&s;&s;ible that with a heart, overflowing with &s;o great a pa&s;&s;ion, you &s;hould have made no attempts towards either in&s;piring the &s;ame in his, or expre&s;&s;ing your own to him?&mdash;I have my an&s;wer ready, replied &s;he.</P>
<P>I was born with a heart greatly &s;u&s;ceptible of tenderne&s;s, but yet at the &s;ame time with a deal of pride. The one cannot be grati|fied but at the expen&s;e of the other. To make me happy, they ought both to agree, which is a difficult matter; and my condi|tion
<PB N="35" REF="022876_0237_0FBA9CCD529BA430">
is &s;till more mi&s;erable when my glory is wounded, than when my heart bleeds; and I have therefore re&s;olved to gratify it. Had I &s;hown my &s;entiments, and they been &s;light|ed, I &s;hould have died with grief; and that was my rea&s;on for avoiding him. I was &s;ure of my lips, but could not an&s;wer for my eyes; and yet, whil&s;t I was &s;hunning his looks, I was ever &s;eeking for them. What &s;torm would they not rai&s;e in my &s;oul, when my eyes happened to glance on him! My tenderne&s;s and pride always &s;tepped in between him and me. The one forced me towards him, the other with-held my fondne&s;s; and the&s;e different impre&s;&s;ions gave me a con|fu&s;ed and ba&s;hful air, which I was afraid might betray me. Yet there is not one mo|ment of my life, wherein my heart doth not require, and I refu&s;e him to its eager de&s;ires. My &s;entiments are as violent now, as when new; and more than once an increa&s;e of ten|derne&s;s has exhau&s;ted the whole &s;tock of cou|rage I had collected by reflection. My thoughts are &s;till on him without intermi&s;&s;i|on. He falls in between every object and me; in all the projects I form, I have him &s;till in view: I fancy his e&s;teem is to be the reward of all the good I do, and I prize it yet more than all the tender &s;entiments I am able to &s;uppo&s;e in him. I have &s;et my&s;elf the harde&s;t ta&s;k in the world, a &s;trictne&s;s of behaviour that denies me even the plea&s;ures of imagination; but e&s;pecially, I have pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="36" REF="022876_0238_0FBA9CD047FD22B0">
to avoid him, and accordingly keep my word with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>One heart alone is unequal to &s;o mighty a &s;truggle; and a friend who vi&s;ited me of|ten, &s;eeing me pen&s;ive and melancholy, at la&s;t wre&s;ted my &s;ecret from me. The con|fe&s;&s;ion co&s;t me as much as if it had been &s;omething criminal. He endeavoured to quiet my timorou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;aid&mdash;Do you think we owe as much fidelity to this whim of honor impo&s;ed by cu&s;tom, as to the other which is the real attendant of virtue? Be|lieve me, madam, the world is not too hard, you owe it but the appearances of decorum, no more is required of you.&mdash;I cannot be of your way of thinking, an&s;wered I, and I have never met with a woman good for any thing, after once throwing off the prejudice of ho|nor. Be&s;ides, I have more regard for my&s;elf than for the world: I &s;tand in need of my own good opinion, and the te&s;timony of my con|&s;cience is more nece&s;&s;ary to me, than all the &s;uffrages of the public.&mdash;But will you, &s;aid he again, fall a &s;acrifice to your pa&s;&s;ion? You mu&s;t either get the better of, or yield to it. &mdash;If my heart could have obeyed me, re|plied I, I &s;hould have got rid of it long ago, but I can bring it to no manner of terms. Nay, &s;carce can I forgive my &s;en&s;ibility, and it is you that have recalled me to the atten|tion I owe my&s;elf.</P>
<P>But after all, madam, an inclination is not a thing that depends on us; it in&s;inuates
<PB N="37" REF="022876_0239_0FBA9CD2AEDA3788">
into our hearts without our leave: pa&s;&s;ions &s;eize and hold us in their power as long as they plea&s;e, and the whole guilt lies in the u&s;e we make of them. What have I not done to tear him from my heart? I attempt|ed to leave my native country, and go over to a foreign court. I thought change of place and objects, might give a new turn to my ideas; but love, more diligent than me, flew and overtook me on the road. See|ing therefore that all my precautions were u&s;ele&s;s, and my affairs requiring my pre|&s;ence at home, I returned back. Next I en|deavoured to force my&s;elf into a liking to &s;ome per&s;ons that made their addre&s;&s;es to me, hoping to weaken one pa&s;&s;ion by ano|ther, and thus at la&s;t to give them both the &s;lip. But, alas! all to no purpo&s;e. I have &s;acrificed every thing to my imaginary love, and my fidelity to this phanta&s;m of a pa&s;&s;ion, is proof again&s;t all. It is really wonderful what lengths I have gone with this mere idea. I have per&s;onalized it, &s;o that I keep a &s;o|cial intercour&s;e with it; nay, we have our quarrels and reconciliations: at other times again we are upon ea&s;ier terms, and, my melancholy being then more &s;oothing, I would not barter it for the highe&s;t gratifica|tions of plea&s;ure. It is love alone that can give tho&s;e endearing fits of &s;adne&s;s which we enjoy with thanks. My ideas are &s;o &s;trong, that there are moments when I fancy
<PB N="38" REF="022876_0240_0FBA9CD3D3A01BE0">
him near me, and love wears away the whole &s;pace that &s;eparates us.</P>
<P>Would you know what has led me to this exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion? It is my extreme &s;everity to my&s;elf. It is not tho&s;e that yield, who love mo&s;t, but tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t. All you deny the &s;en&s;es, adds to the hoard of tender|ne&s;s. I was let loo&s;e to the exaggerations of my mind, and, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;eldom fur|ni&s;hes all the gratifications our de&s;ires lend it, I have loved not in proportion to the me|rit I have found, but to that which I ima|gined.</P>
<P>I heard much about that time, that the count had an affair with a lady; a new ad|dition to my grief. My pa&s;&s;ion, I fancied, gave me a right over his. When we love dearly, we would fain be loved again, and always fancy our&s;elves worthy of &s;uch a return. I was as much piqued at his amour, as if he had really been guilty of an infidelity to me, and his affection for another rai&s;ed a barrier betweeen him and me. From his engagement he &s;hifted to another. From thence I fan|cied he was incon&s;tant, and neither &s;erious nor re&s;pectful of love, and I found I was doomed to the laborious ta&s;k of effacing from my heart a &s;entiment that was deeply engraven in it. But, alas! even now, a hun|dred times a day I &s;ay I will forget him, and &s;ay it, but to think &s;till more of him. What mu&s;t I do with the va&s;t &s;tock of love thus &s;welling in my heart? Lovers are often cur|ed
<PB N="39" REF="022876_0241_0FBA9CD5555B02B0">
by reflections; but mine di&s;temper me the more, and rea&s;on is too weak to a&s;&s;i&s;t me again&s;t my pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But it is too much expatiating upon what I feel. What, ma|dam, mu&s;t you now think of me? Or what impre&s;&s;ions does my madne&s;s make upon you?&mdash;Think! replied I, why, that it is a &s;ort of con&s;olation to find &s;o e&s;timable a per|&s;on as you, in &s;ome &s;hape, partaking of my weakne&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>After all this, now &s;uffer me, madam, re&s;umed &s;he, to do my office, (for it is what we mu&s;t do &s;ometimes;) by de&s;iring you to con&s;ider, that, though I have not fallen into the greate&s;t precipices of love, I have ne|verthele&s;s been exce&s;&s;ively mi&s;erable. From a conduct tolerably laudable, what advan|tages have I reaped? My&s;elf the only wit|ne&s;s of &s;o many difficulties and &s;trugglings. In love every thing of this nature is lo&s;t, becau&s;e unknown, be&s;ides that the heart is never well compo&s;ed again after having been once agitated with that pa&s;&s;ion. How ami|able and de&s;irable is virtue, even barely with regard to our repo&s;e! Take the mo&s;t fortu|nate pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;um up, if po&s;&s;ible, all the alarms, the pangs, the anxieties, the fears, the jealou&s;ies that attend them: lay all the&s;e a&s;ide, and leave to love none but its pure joys; how few will they appear? Yet, for the &s;hadow of the&s;e few plea&s;ures, we vitiate our ta&s;te, and lo&s;e the reli&s;h of true plea&s;ures for all our lives. Pardon, madam,
<PB N="40" REF="022876_0242_0FBA9CD6D0592288">
this &s;mall touch of morality. If, by lay|ing my&s;elf open to you as I have now done, I have forfeited the privilege of giving ad|vice, I hope by a mutual confidence to re|gain a new right to your heart, and make my&s;elf believed a friend free from &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Here I was going, in return, to unbo&s;om my &s;oul to her, in full liberty, in regard to my &s;ituation, when we were told that my fa|ther wanted us. Having waited on him, he a&s;ked me in a rough angry tone, what I had done to prince Camillus? "His mother has been telling me this moment, continued he, that he grieves mo&s;t terribly, and you are taxed with being the cau&s;e of it: it is very cutting, &s;ays &s;he to me, fir&s;t to bear &s;o much again&s;t my will, my &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion for your daughter, and then to find that very pa&s;&s;ion &s;erves but to make him unhappy. I believe you too much my friend, not to join with me in breaking an engagement which is not at all agreeable to me, and you are too much a man of honor not to think rather of ful|filling the duties of gratitude, than of ag|grandizing your family at the expen&s;e of the friend&s;hip you owe me. Since, therefore, your daughter helps us by her ill-treatment of my &s;on, let us, concluded &s;he, complete a rupture, which we dur&s;t not have attempted without her concurrence; and for this pur|po&s;e I beg of you to carry, or &s;end her down into the country. I an&s;wered, that I de&s;ired her to be per&s;uaded that no intere&s;ts were
<PB N="41" REF="022876_0243_0FBA9CDBF9505148">
dearer to me than her own; that I had no|thing more at heart than to give her &s;atis|faction, and that I &s;hould immediately order you away. Therefore, Mademoi&s;elle, get your|&s;elf ready to &s;et out for my country &s;eat in two or three days. The gratitude and fide|lity I owe the prince&s;s prevent my talking to you in the &s;train of an offended father, but I had rather &s;erve her than you. Certainly, pur&s;ued he, turning to Leonora, who had followed me, nothing can come up to my daughter's ingratitude to an amiable prince, who has a violent pa&s;&s;ion for her, who &s;acri|fices the greate&s;t advantages to his love, and is the &s;upport of our tottering family. When the prince&s;s, his mother, out of indul|gence to him and kind regard to me, is going give a con&s;ent which co&s;ts her &s;o much, &s;he, my daughter, alone rai&s;es an ob&s;tacle to an affair, which &s;he ought to buy at the expen&s;e of half her life!&mdash;Oh! in &s;pite of re&s;oluti|on, I &s;hall lo&s;e my temper, anger re&s;umes its rights, and will have vent! Begone, and never more appear in my &s;ight." I would have an&s;wered, but he was too much exa&s;perated, and I found the be&s;t way was to withdraw immediately to my chamber. Leonora &s;taid however &s;ome time behind to try to pacify him, but his pa&s;&s;ion ran &s;o high, and his rage was &s;o violent, that &s;he found it a hard matter to calm him.</P>
<P>That very moment the prince came to pay him a vi&s;it, and finding him prodigiou&s;ly
<PB N="42" REF="022876_0244_0FBA9CDCD29A15C0">
ruffled, a&s;ked him the rea&s;on of his di&s;com|po&s;ure: "My daughter, replied the old gen|tleman, has been unhappy enough to di&s;plea&s;e you, for which I cannot puni&s;h her too much, and therefore have ju&s;t now ordered her away into the country." The prince imme|diately threw him&s;elf at his feet to beg I might be allowed to &s;tay, but my father re|plied, that his word was too &s;trongly enga|ged to the prince&s;s ever to go from it. The prince a&s;&s;ured him I was no ways guilty: "Mu&s;t parents, &s;aid he, interfere in the quarrels of lovers, which have often no other foundation but their delicacy? It is I, &s;ir, that am in fault. Love is never &s;atis|fied, and often unju&s;t. But at lea&s;t give me leave to &s;ee your daughter.&mdash;You have it, my lord, replied my father.&mdash;Well then, continued the prince, I will go to my mo|ther, and entreat her to de&s;ire you her&s;elf to break off this cruel journey.&mdash;Were &s;he even to order it, an&s;wered my father, it would be all to no purpo&s;e. She might think you and I are of a party in it; and I owe more to my honor than to any con&s;ide|ration whatever."</P>
<P>Leonora had withdrawn, when &s;he &s;aw the prince enter my father's clo&s;et, though not &s;o far but &s;he overheard this part of their con|ver&s;ation, after which &s;he came up to my room, where &s;he found me &s;inking under a dejection of &s;pirits that cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. "O my dear, cried I, my father's anger di&s;|tracts

me; but what afflicts me mo&s;t is, that he is not angry without a cau&s;e. Alas! but a moment ago you were talking of the trials of love: could I have thought I was de&s;tin|ed to be &s;o &s;oon an in&s;tance of them?" Leo|nora on this repeated to me what the prince had &s;aid to my father, but his genero&s;ity and virtue &s;erved only to add to my guilt and affliction.</P>
<P>The prince that moment entered my room, and finding me drowned in tears;&mdash;though I am ignorant of the cau&s;e of tho&s;e tears, &s;aid he, and dare not flatter my&s;elf they are meant for me, yet, madam, you are afflict|ed, and that is a &s;ufficient motive for me to partake in your &s;orrow.&mdash;My lord, replied I, abandon a wretched creature that di&s;turbs the tranquillity of your family: do not add your con&s;tancy to my load of misfortunes. You have already done too much for me, and it is time to think of your&s;elf, and what you owe the prince&s;s your mother.&mdash;Why will you, madam, an&s;wered he, ever take upon you the care of my duty? It no longer be|comes you to affect &s;uch a genero&s;ity. This la&s;t &s;peech offended me.&mdash;What, &s;ir, do you mean by this, &s;aid I, and what am I ac|cu&s;ed of?&mdash;I accu&s;e you of nothing, replied the prince, and you will never find a per&s;e|cutor in me. In the piques of lovers, the delicacy of the per&s;on in fault is always &s;uf|ficient revenge to the injured; I a&s;k no other: but at lea&s;t, Mademoi&s;elle, help us

not to lo&s;e you. I have not been able to pre|vail with your father. It is the fir&s;t time in my life I have &s;een him angry with you, and I mu&s;t die with grief, if he continues much longer in the &s;ame temper.</P>
<P>Here I was told that one of the prince&s;s Flavia's gentlemen wanted to &s;peak with me. He brought me word that her highne&s;s had engaged me for a party of hunting the next day. I de&s;ired Leonora to go and know my father's plea&s;ure what I mu&s;t do. His an|&s;wer was&mdash;To be &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t obey the prince&s;s: &s;ince &s;he has done her the honor to name her for the party, &s;he ought to go. &mdash;I therefore &s;ent the gentleman back with my thanks to the prince&s;s, and to a&s;&s;ure her I would not fail to comply with her orders.</P>
<P>I was now obliged to get my things rea|dy and think of my dre&s;s, but indeed I was very little di&s;po&s;ed for joy. One of the in|conveniences of a court is, that we mu&s;t have the &s;entiments that reign there, or do as if we had them; &s;o that, often under an outward appearance of mirth, the inward angui&s;h of the heart is concealed.</P>
<P>I joined the company the next day with a very heavy heart, but di&s;&s;embled my unea|&s;ine&s;s by &s;aying I had had a violent head-ach. Nothing in the world could be more gallant than our hunting match, which was to con|clude with an entertainment at a plea&s;ure &s;eat in the country. The ladies made a very fine appearance on hor&s;eback. My father, who
<PB N="45" REF="022876_0247_0FBA9CE39D1ABAB8">
neglected nothing that could give an addi|tion of graces to my per&s;on, had made me learn to ride, and my dre&s;s was blue trimmed with gold. I was liked better than I could have wi&s;hed, and the prince&s;s, who was very obliging, complimented me upon it in the hand&s;ome&s;t manner in the world. The fir&s;t per&s;ons my eyes glanced on were the prince and the duke, very regularly paying their court to her highne&s;s. My confu&s;ion was inexpre&s;&s;ible: I was at a lo&s;s how to di&s;po&s;e of my looks; the prince was ob&s;erving me, and that increa&s;ed my di&s;order.</P>
<P>The chace began at la&s;t, and the duke contrived means to get near me. When he came up, I expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s at his &s;ight, that he withdrew very re&s;pectfully, &s;aying, I hope, then, madam, you will take for done, all the &s;ervices I do not render you.</P>
<P>When the &s;port was over, the company repaired to a country &s;eat, which was finely illuminated; and, as &s;oon as they arrived, the ladies withdrew to the apartments pre|pared for them, in order to refre&s;h them|&s;elves, and &s;hift their dre&s;&s;es. Here, pull|ing out my handkerchief, I found a letter in my pocket, without being able to know how it came there; and, ju&s;t as I was reading it, the prince &s;tepped in to my chamber. I hid it in a great hurry, but he perceived my con|fu&s;ion, and &s;aid to me, I find, madam, I am trouble&s;ome, and &s;hall therefore withdraw.
<PB N="46" REF="022876_0248_0FBA9CE517D31F00">
The time was now come for my evil de&s;tiny to prevail over my life.</P>
<P>When I had changed cloaths, I was oblig|ed to go down to the company. How dif|ficult a matter it is to put on a plea&s;ant air with a bleeding heart! In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation I told the prince&s;s I was going down into the country. She a&s;ked me upon what account; I replied, my father was willing to &s;pend a few weeks of the &s;pring at his &s;eat, and a&s;&s;ured her I &s;hould carry with me the mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of the obligations I lay under to her goodne&s;s. She inquired like|wi&s;e how far the hou&s;e might be; and upon my telling her that it was but two or three leagues off, &s;he had the complai&s;ance to pro|mi&s;e to come down and &s;ee me. I received all the&s;e marks of di&s;tinction as I ought. The duke was pre&s;ent when I mentioned my journey, and &s;eemed to expre&s;s a concern. But as for the prince, he did not appear the whole evening, which gave me much unea&s;ine&s;s. The company went to cards; there was al&s;o a concert in the drawing-room, whither I followed the prince&s;s, becau&s;e I found my account better with the mu&s;ic: for there I had nothing to do but feel and be &s;ilent. Supper was &s;erved up; every thing was in the mo&s;t magnificent ta&s;te; and there was a grand ball after.</P>
<P>The duke made the mo&s;t brilliant and graceful appearance in the world at this en|tertainment,
<PB N="47" REF="022876_0249_0FBA9CE6B95769B0">
and I own I found my&s;elf po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with quite new &s;entiments, which I per|ceived very well were tho&s;e the prince had been &s;o long requiring of me in his behalf, but which till then I had been utterly unacquaint|ed with. Though I was very &s;orry not to &s;ee him, becau&s;e his ab&s;ence was a &s;ure &s;ign of his di&s;content, yet I could not help find|ing my&s;elf more at ea&s;e for a moment: my looks and &s;entiments had a greater liberty of action, and I &s;aw with &s;orrow, though not without a mixture of joy, the mo&s;t vio|lent pa&s;&s;ion written in the duke's eyes. Whenever I happened to be his partner, he was thought to dance better than u&s;ual, and the prince&s;s made us repeat together &s;everal dances, which &s;he fancied we performed better than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he was endeavouring to plea&s;e, and was, perhaps, very &s;en&s;ible that he did &s;o.</P>
<P>After the ball was over, I hurried home to my apartment, whither Leonora, who had been &s;o kind as to keep always with me, al&s;o followed. As &s;oon as I &s;aw her, I or|dered my maids to retire, and then &s;he be|gan to tell me, how dearly I was like to pay for the moment's plea&s;ure I had had. I gave her an account of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;he knew it better than my&s;elf, having ob&s;erved me all the time. I &s;howed her the letter I had received, and told her how the prince had &s;urpri&s;ed me reading it, and that no doubt he &s;u&s;pected it came from the duke of
<PB N="48" REF="022876_0250_0FBA9CE81B2BC7B0">
Praxede. Indeed, an&s;wered &s;he, you are to be pitied, madam; but what can be done for you? We &s;pent part of the night in con|&s;ulting upon the different methods I could take, but day-light appearing before we could fix on any, we went to our beds un|re&s;olved.</P>
<P>The prince called upon Leonora betimes in the morning: it is perhaps ill-mannerly, madam, &s;aid he, to come &s;o early to di&s;turb people that go to bed by day-light. He had, it &s;eems, pa&s;&s;ed the night on a terrace that lay under my window, and had &s;een how late we had &s;at up together; he knew al&s;o all that had happened at the ball, having been pre&s;ent in di&s;gui&s;e. He expre&s;&s;ed a lively and deep concern to Leonora, telling her how he had caught me reading a letter, which, upon &s;ight of him, I had put up with a di&s;order that had betrayed me; and, upon my friend's endeavouring to di&s;&s;uade him from the notions he had formed of that let|ter, he an&s;wered, I do not &s;eek to accu&s;e her, and &s;hould be very &s;orry to have any cau&s;e to do it. Alas! far from it: &s;o great was my good opinion of her &s;incerity, that &s;he might have attempted any thing upon the &s;trength of my confidence.&mdash;What then is it you complain of, replied Leonora, what hath &s;he done more than common civi|lity required? (for, as to the letter affair, &s;he made him believe he was mi&s;taken, and folks in love are ea&s;ily deceived) I cannot, an|&s;wered
<PB N="49" REF="022876_0251_0FBA9CE9F68B5160">
he, ground either my &s;u&s;picions, or even my di&s;content, on any thing certain; but a &s;ecret foreboding di&s;turbs my heart: my fears are not quieted by her love, and, when &s;he is with the duke, methinks I &s;ee in her eyes a &s;omething &s;he never hath with me. Leonora was not wanting in her en|deavours to calm tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions. He begged her to obtain leave of my father to vi&s;it me in the country, and a&s;&s;ured her at parting, that his &s;u&s;picions and unea&s;ine&s;&s;es on my account &s;hould never reach him, and that he would owe nothing to paternal au|thority, nor accept of my hand if my heart did not tender it.</P>
<P>The prince having obtained the liberty he de&s;ired, I &s;at out without daring to take leave of my father, and under his di&s;plea|&s;ure I found my&s;elf more ea&s;y in the coun|try. Our &s;eat was a noble building, though not in the modern ta&s;te: there was a large park, fine woods, and plea&s;ant water. Na|ture &s;eemed every where at liberty, without being forced by art. I was in hopes that the calm tranquillity that reigned in this place might diffu&s;e it&s;elf into my &s;oul: but, alas! the pa&s;&s;ions delight in &s;ilence, they increa&s;e and &s;trengthen by &s;olitude. I found my&s;elf with di&s;po&s;itions till then unknown, and in a di&s;order and agitation, which neverthele&s;s had a &s;ecret charm.</P>
<P>Leonora often intruded upon my &s;olitary moments to rouze me out of my reveries,
<PB N="50" REF="022876_0252_0FBA9CEB5D52E988">
and obligingly reproach me with &s;hunning her. Then, &s;aid I, I mu&s;t al&s;o &s;hun my&s;elf, for you are my &s;ole comfort. But the truth is, that all my time is not &s;ufficient to be|&s;tow on what I feel of late &mdash;Your reflec|tions, an&s;wered &s;he, might be better employ|ed on the misfortunes love has in &s;tore for you. I know my advices will be in vain again&s;t a growing pa&s;&s;ion, but, though u&s;e|le&s;s, I &s;till owe them to you: con&s;ider, ma|dam, continued &s;he, that you are wanting to every thing that is mo&s;t &s;acred, to your|&s;elf, to your father, and what is &s;till more, to the mo&s;t lovely prince in the world, and to the true&s;t and be&s;t proved pa&s;&s;ion that ever was; and for whom? For one you do not know, and who will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly render your life mi&s;erable. You mu&s;t not fancy that all pa&s;&s;ions carry their excu&s;es with them. &mdash;Here we were interrupted and parted. I was very &s;en&s;ible &s;he was in the right, but her rea&s;on and mine were both too weak to help me. She was threatening me with mis|fortunes, and troubling my life, without ef|fectually arming me again&s;t my evil de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>I do not know by what enchantment every thing about me &s;erved the duke. I cannot tell whether he had bribed any of my people, but I met with marks of his pa&s;&s;ion in every place. Once I found a letter on my toilet; at other times ver&s;es would be offered to my view in the woods and mo&s;t bye places, whi|ther I liked to retire. Here is the letter I
<PB N="51" REF="022876_0253_0FBA9CEEBB6B4DC0">
have &s;poken of. At fir&s;t I made a &s;cruple of unfolding it; and, had it been po&s;&s;ible, would have &s;ent it back, whence it came unopen|ed: but we can hardly deny our&s;elves a plea|&s;ure that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, and the receiving of which is to be unknown. I therefore opened it, and read the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"I tremble, Mademoi&s;elle, to appear be|fore you, and am under a dread of your di&s;|plea&s;ure; yet what makes my crime, ought to be my excu&s;e.&mdash;I cannot forbear telling you that you have taught me to love, with|out knowing your&s;elf tho&s;e tender &s;enti|ments you have taught me. Though, were you to judge of your&s;elf only by the pa&s;&s;ion you have in&s;pired in me, you could not be ignorant that you are the mo&s;t adorable creature in the world. But by the infinite &s;en&s;e I have of your worth, methinks I am &s;till placing you at a greater di&s;tance from me. I have a love and re&s;pect which you only can in&s;pire, and which no one but my|&s;elf is capable of feeling."</P>
<P>The next day as I was going to &s;it down by a large canal in a grove, I found this other letter on a &s;eat of green turf, on which I u&s;ed to re&s;t my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"You need not be under any fear on my account, Mademoi&s;elle. The &s;entiments you have rai&s;ed in me have all the warmth of pa&s;&s;ion, with the innocence of virtue. I dare glory in the avowing them, and will be|lieve I have no other merit but what is deriv|ed
<PB N="52" REF="022876_0254_0FBA9CF00A8C6C98">
from them. Let the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of my affection plead in its behalf; &s;ince there can be no greater proof of love, than to be more eager to love and to be loved again. For my part, I am rewarded for my pa&s;&s;ion by what I feel, and am plea&s;ed with the expecta|tion of happier days: judge, then, madam, if I can ever fail of honoring and re&s;pecting you."</P>
<P>Another day this third billet was offered to my view in a clo&s;et, whither I u&s;ed to retire.</P>
<P>"I pa&s;s the days and nights under your walls, and, though I cannot live from the place that holds my bli&s;s, I know not how to approach; all the ways that lead to my charmer appear full of difficulties. But even this becomes an advantage, &s;ince finding you, at la&s;t, mu&s;t claim &s;ome merit.&mdash;I cannot return to court; I have not power to di&s;|charge my duty there:&mdash;and think, where|ever you are not, I am obliged to no duty but that of regretting your ab&s;ence. Much le&s;s can I &s;eek for plea&s;ure. Can any be found without you? I find at lea&s;t there is none for me in the world but where you are. In you alone, love has centered all my hopes, my wi&s;hes, and my plea&s;ures.&mdash;Will you not then, through pity, relieve what I &s;uffer through love?"</P>
<P>Thus every thing &s;poke in his behalf, and was ever reminding me of what I could not forget. I believed ea&s;ily the agreeable truths that clo&s;ed with my de&s;ires. He was by
<PB N="53" REF="022876_0255_0FBA9CF1D51E1CD8">
degrees u&s;ing me to hear him talk of his pa&s;|&s;ion, and in&s;en&s;ibly gaining upon my deli|cacy and ba&s;hfulne&s;s, whil&s;t I allowed and forgave my loving him.</P>
<P>A few days after my arrival in the coun|try, the counte&s;s Emilia came to &s;ee me. She was a friend of the family's, and had al|ways expre&s;&s;ed a high friend&s;hip for me. She brought with her a very amiable daughter, who, after the fir&s;t acquaintance, ob&s;erving that I was alone, and might be glad of com|pany, offered very kindly to &s;tay behind with me, if I would but a&s;k her mamma leave. At any other time I &s;hould have been very glad of &s;uch an offer, but I was now &s;o melan|choly, and &s;o much taken up with my pa&s;|&s;ion, that, though &s;ometimes I endeavour|ed to divert my thoughts, I &s;till fell into my old way, and my tenderne&s;s made me believe that I owed my&s;elf wholly and entirely to my &s;en&s;ations of love, and that to deviate from them was no better than an infidelity. However, I could not well decline a&s;king her of her mother, and therefore made the propo&s;al, which &s;he readily came into.</P>
<P>I diverted my new companion as well as I could. We &s;oon contracted a familiarity with one another, and yet &s;he was not open with me, but &s;eemed rather pen&s;ive and taken up with &s;omething at heatt. I did not choo&s;e to let her know I perceived it, for fear of giving her unea&s;ine&s;s, nor pre&s;s to be let into her &s;ecrets, becau&s;e I was glad
<PB N="54" REF="022876_0256_0FBA9CF36489AEF8">
her re&s;ervedne&s;s towards me, gave me a right of behaving in the &s;ame manner to her. She would often be alone, which plea&s;ed me much, as I had thereby the liberty and op|portunity of being &s;o too.</P>
<P>Going one day into her apartments, I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to find the duke with her, and I believe they both perceived the di&s;|order his pre&s;ence threw me into. At fir&s;t I had a great mind to re&s;ent it, but contain|ed my&s;elf upon reflection, that, not being acquainted with the &s;ecret of my heart, &s;he could mean no harm in introducing the duke. I could not hinder her from &s;eeing her friends at my hou&s;e, and the duke, know|ing nothing of what I had &s;uffered upon his account, could have no notion of di&s;oblig|ing me by a vi&s;it to a lady of his acquain|tance. The&s;e rea&s;ons calmed my re&s;ent|ment &mdash;I made but a &s;hort &s;tay with them, and ran immediately after to Leonora. I told her I had ju&s;t &s;een the duke in my friend's apartment, and what concern it gave me, le&s;t my father and the prince &s;hould think I had an hand in it, begging her to tell me what I had be&s;t do. She knew me too well to &s;u&s;pect any artifice in my conduct. My fears an&s;wered for me; and &s;he knew I could feel, but that was all. She therefore told me &s;he would wait on my father with an ac|count of the whole of the matter, and would take his orders how to act, but that &s;he was pretty &s;ure he would &s;u&s;pect nothing further.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="022876_0257_0FBA9CF4D456F860">It fell out accordingly. He was per&s;uaded that it was a mere chance accident, and, that as it was not po&s;&s;ible to turn out of doors a young lady of my friend's quality, &s;o was it likewi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible to prevent her receiv|ing what vi&s;its &s;he plea&s;ed in her apartment; but he de&s;ired her never to be one moment from me. They agreed al&s;o that he &s;hould now and then take a trip down to us, to con|ceal from the world the knowledge of my di&s;grace with him, and prevent people's talk about it to my di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Leonora's return made me ea&s;y as to my father, but I was certain all our precautions would avail nothing with the prince, and that he would not hearken to rea&s;on like the old gentleman. Going into my room, I found a letter laid upon a couch, and indeed few days pa&s;&s;ed without my receiving &s;ome, one way or another. I opened it, and read the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"I appear no more at court, Mademoi|&s;elle, out of regard for my love. I cannot help thinking my pa&s;&s;ion is legible in my eyes, and by looking at me I fancy every body can di&s;cover that you are the per&s;on I adore.&mdash; What! mu&s;t I make a &s;ecret of loving you? The only merit I would boa&s;t of is a high &s;en&s;e of your value, and a re&s;pect equal to your worth.&mdash;My &s;entiments, madam, want only to be felt, and I words to expre&s;s them."</P>
<P>Everafter I avoided going into my friend's apartment, but &s;he was fonder of my com|pany
<PB N="56" REF="022876_0258_0FBA9CF7111B5948">
than ever. You &s;hun me, &s;aid &s;he, one day, you have found out the duke's in|clination to you, and fancy me deep in &s;ome plot again&s;t you; but do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that though he is very much my friend, I am incapable of acting any part unworthy of you, or my&s;elf.&mdash;But, &s;aid I, where did you get acquainted with this man, for I am &s;ure I have never &s;een him at your hou&s;e?&mdash;I have known him a long while, re|plied &s;he, and the rea&s;on of your not &s;eeing him was, becau&s;e he was at the army at the time you vi&s;ited us. I became acquainted with him at the marchione&s;s * * *, and &s;hall one day or another tell you the hi&s;tory of our friend&s;hip; but at pre&s;ent give me leave to inform you, that he feels the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for you. What part therefore will you have me act? Will you not take it ami&s;s if I receive his profe&s;&s;ions to deliver them to you? Tell me how I can &s;erve you. If this doth not plea&s;e you, and his love is offen&s;ive, I will have nothing more to &s;ay to him. My friend was much too hard for me. She wanted to know the di&s;po&s;itions of my &s;oul, and people in love are apt to be communicative, for the&s;e two &s;entiments always go hand in hand. Be&s;ides, &s;he was a fitter per&s;on to make a confidante of than Leonora, our ages agreeing better with one another. I therefore unbo&s;omed my &s;oul, and told her my &s;ecret upon honor not to mention a word of it to the duke, which &s;he promi&s;|ed,
<PB N="57" REF="022876_0259_0FBA9CFA24A96FE0">
and I am willing to believe &s;he has kept her word with me. I informed her without re&s;erve of all I have related to you: my &s;tory &s;urpri&s;ed and affected her much, and &s;he gave me new a&s;&s;urances of doing nothing but what I &s;hould think fit.</P>
<P>The next day we took a walk at a &s;mall di&s;tance from our &s;eat. It was a very fine place. Whil&s;t we were abroad, prince Ca|millus came to pay us a vi&s;it, but was told I was gone out. He thought, I &s;uppo&s;e, that in the country one was always to be met with at home, and could not conceive, that having &s;o large and fine a park, we &s;hould go to &s;eek a walk abroad. Yet, had he thought proper, he might have been &s;atisfied of the truth. If he had but a&s;ked the &s;ervants, they could have told him where I was. But, without mak|ing the lea&s;t enquiry, he went away in a pa&s;|&s;ion, and the next day &s;ent me the following letter.</P>
<P>"Love led me ye&s;terday to your &s;olitude, Mademoi&s;elle, but even Cupid him&s;elf met with a di&s;appointment. I found nothing but a melancholy &s;olitude, everything that could plea&s;e was fled with you. However, do not fear that my complaints &s;hall ever more come to di&s;turb your plea&s;ures. No; I value them as yours: though I cannot ta&s;te any, where you are ab&s;ent, may you &s;till par|take of a great deal where I am far off; proofs of love become offen&s;ive when we are not in a di&s;po&s;ition to make them a ret<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">."</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="022876_0260_0FBA9CFC9137EDB0">That very evening we took a walk by our|&s;elves; my friend made me va&s;t prote&s;ta|tions of friend&s;hip, and &s;poke with great &s;en&s;ibility of all I had mentioned to her. Our conver&s;ation was long and tender, but at la&s;t it grew late, and we were obliged to return homewards.</P>
<P>As we were walking back to the ca&s;tle, I heard a noi&s;e near me, and was mightily &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find my&s;elf &s;topped by &s;omebody that lay at my feet. I gave a &s;hriek, upon which a voice, which I &s;oon knew for the duke's, &s;aid,&mdash;Do not be frightened, ma|dam, I am no enemy.&mdash;Yes, &s;ir, an&s;wered I, you mu&s;t be one, cruelly thus to expo&s;e me.&mdash;You will not be expo&s;ed, replied he; no body can know I am here, and your re|putation is dearer to me than my pa&s;&s;ion: but what can I do with the mighty &s;tore of love you have in&s;pired me with?&mdash;I now turned to my friend, and a&s;ked whether &s;he had a hand in this piece of treachery?&mdash;No, madam, an&s;wered he for her, &s;he has no manner of &s;hare in what I do, and it is from the inno|cence and purity of my &s;entiments alone I have borrowed this pre&s;umption. He then threw him&s;elf again at my feet, and &s;aid the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate things in the world. I would have got from him and called my friend, but could not &s;tir, &s;omething invi&s;ible, un|known, too prevailing &s;eized my &s;oul, and my legs refu&s;ed to perform their office. For|tunately I had not power to &s;peak, and
<PB N="59" REF="022876_0261_0FBA9CFDD51CC518">
therefore only an&s;wered him with my heart, but my eyes would ea&s;ily have betrayed their meaning, could he have &s;een them. In &s;hort, he per&s;uaded me of his pa&s;&s;ion. Heavens! what did he not &s;ay, and how did it not af|fect me? But, at la&s;t, my friend informing us that day-light was approaching, and that we mu&s;t part, he a&s;ked leave to return again the next day. I had not power to deny him, and withdrew in a di&s;order and agitation that cannot be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the night awake, and was never taken up with &s;uch a variety of &s;entiments: for joy, grief, hopes, fear, and remor&s;e, took their turns, and rai&s;ed &s;uch a &s;torm in my brea&s;t, that day ap|peared before &s;leep could approach my eye|lids.</P>
<P>I went very early to my friend's apart|ment, and finding her pen&s;ive and &s;orrowful, enquired into the rea&s;on. I &s;hall be loth to tell it you, an&s;wered &s;he, but yet I cannot betray the confidence you repo&s;e in me, and &s;hould think my&s;elf wanting in my obliga|tions to you, if I did not acquaint you with the duke's engagements. What! cried I, has he then placed his affections el&s;ewhere? Perhaps that is all over, replied &s;he; you are capable of effacing the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;i|ons; but, however, hear me out if you can: I am going to reveal to you his &s;ecret and my own.&mdash;Sure, &s;aid I, it is not you that he is in love with?&mdash;No, madam, replied &s;he
<PB N="60" REF="022876_0262_0FBA9CFF5743F690">
ha&s;tily, compo&s;e your&s;elf and hear me; for you mu&s;t know the bottom, in order to take the cour&s;e that can fit you be&s;t.&mdash;</P>
<P>I have known the duke &s;ome time. He was &s;omewhat forward in courting an ac|quaintance with me, and got one of my re|lations to introduce him. I was a&s;toni&s;hed that a man of his youth, and &s;o taken up with gay plea&s;ures, &s;hould come to &s;eek a per&s;on much retired, and who thought more of leading a rational life, than one diver&s;i|fied with mirth and gaiety. I enquired therefore into his views, and &s;elf-love made me believe, that, not being a bad match as to fortune, they might relate to me. But I was not long in that error. You know there's a friend&s;hip between madam L * * * and me. She is very amiable. I &s;u&s;pected his a&s;&s;iduity at our hou&s;e might be meant for her, and accordingly, by often talking to him about her, and telling him all the hand|&s;ome things I could think of her, I was &s;oon convinced that his fondne&s;s was all intended for that friend. The di&s;covery nettled me a little; I avoided &s;ome time enquiring why, and my heart would fain have &s;pared me an in&s;ight into my weakne&s;s; but, as I feared its &s;urpri&s;es, I was not deceived, and thought I mu&s;t apply the nece&s;&s;ary remedies.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I made a re&s;olution never to &s;ee him more. Alas! it would have proved more for my &s;atisfaction, had I followed this,
<PB N="61" REF="022876_0263_0FBA9D00EA6DF810">
than the conduct I afterwards impo&s;ed upon my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Indeed, fancying I could do &s;till better, I &s;et about wre&s;ting his &s;ecret from him, and was even at the advance of the whole ex|pen&s;e of the confidence, by telling him the misfortune I had had to lo&s;e the Marquis ***, with whom my family had entered into &s;ome engagements relating to a match between us; how &s;en&s;ibly I had been affected with the breaking off of the intended alliance; with what regret I forbid him my doors, when decency and the commands of my relations would no longer allow of his vi&s;its; how much this conduct increa&s;ed my pa&s;&s;ion; and how I found by experience, that &s;everity &s;erves love, and &s;trengthens the impre&s;&s;ion. I made him this confidence, with a view of placing an eternal ob&s;tacle between him and my own heart. I likewi&s;e gave by this a pretence and excu&s;e to my &s;orrow, and a&s;|cribed to another, the effects of my pa&s;&s;ion for him.</P>
<P>This confidence di&s;plea&s;ed him; whether it was contrary to his de&s;igns, or that his vanity had been flattered with the belief that my heart inclined to him; but yet I thought I perceived he had &s;ome &s;ecret views, and would have it in his power to attempt me when he &s;hould think fit.&mdash;It is pretty much the way of the men to have &s;ome object in re&s;erve, after letting their imaginations rove,
<PB N="62" REF="022876_0264_0FBA9D040B5BD258">
and lo&s;ing their ta&s;te for their pre&s;ent plea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>My confidence had quite a contrary effect to what I imagined, for he became eager and fond. He was incon&s;olable, as he &s;aid, at my having &s;uch &s;entiments for another; and when I told him, that it took nothing from him, he thought me guilty of want of delicacy in not under&s;tanding there were pa&s;|&s;ions of e&s;teem infinitely above tho&s;e of the &s;en&s;es. The truth was, I wanted no other from him, but the difficulty lay in convincing me that his was of that kind. Whatever he could &s;ay, I did not believe him the more for it, and there were even &s;ome moments when I e&s;teemed him the le&s;s on that account. He continued always in the &s;ame &s;train, and, had I been willing to flatter my &s;elf-love, I might have believed that I had in&s;pired him with a very &s;ublime pa&s;&s;ion. But this did not &s;atisfy me; I wanted to come to &s;ome conclu&s;ion, and fix my &s;ituation by his.</P>
<P>Many ways offered to that end. I was mi&s;tre&s;s of his &s;ecret. He had intru&s;ted me with his repo&s;e, had de&s;ired me to direct him; and I could without treachery, act a part con|&s;i&s;tent with my intere&s;t, by refu&s;ing to &s;erve him in his amour. Another would have taken the opportunity to be revenged of the pre|ference given to a rival, and nothing was ea&s;ier than this, for my friend was timorous; &s;he was afraid of the world and her family; &s;he feared the duke him&s;elf, and I had no|thing
<PB N="63" REF="022876_0265_0FBA9D067A3F4528">
to do but to indulge her in her own way.</P>
<P>A more worthy conduct, however, pre|&s;ented it&s;elf at the &s;ame time. I kept off all the low re&s;entments we women are &s;u&s;|ceptible of. I examined his ca&s;e and my own, and did not find him guilty in feeling for another, what I could have wi&s;hed he had felt for me. I thought it was my bu&s;i|ne&s;s to puni&s;h my&s;elf for a mi&s;placed affec|tion, by turning it to his advantage, and that my affection ought to be pure and powerful enough to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting in making him more happy in another. I laid a&s;ide all my tender|ne&s;s, and forgot my own intere&s;t, in order to impo&s;e upon my&s;elf the mo&s;t difficult conduct in the world which, however, I have hitherto been able to keep up to. I fancied, that if he could be touched by an honorable behaviour, I &s;hould thereby make a worthy friend of him; and that, however, if it was all lo&s;t upon him, it would not be &s;o for me. In &s;hort, my de|luded imagination has &s;erved him &s;o well, that it has been able to per&s;uade me, that nothing would be more worthy of me than to conquer my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I therefore &s;et about advancing his intere&s;t with my friend, as if on their happine&s;s the whole of mine had depended. I &s;poke to lady L*** of the great pa&s;&s;ion he had for her. I painted it in the &s;tronge&s;t colours, and drew a picture, &s;ketched by truth, but
<PB N="64" REF="022876_0266_0FBA9D07917E0700">
ornamented by love. My friend was &s;ome|what prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, but I found means to combat her prejudices. I calm|ed her fears; I an&s;wered for him; I took all upon my&s;elf; I touched her heart; I moved her inclination to tenderne&s;s, and relieved her mode&s;ty. In &s;hort, when he came to &s;ee her, he had nothing to do, but to fin&s;h what I had &s;o well begun. He found the impre&s;&s;ion ready made to his hands.</P>
<P>There were, indeed, &s;ome moments when I could not help thinking the part I had act|ed very much out of character. "I am wanting to every thing, &s;aid I; I act again&s;t my own principles; I forget the regard I owe to my&s;elf, and know no other duty, but that of expre&s;&s;ing my attachment to him. What a &s;cene is this for indifferent people to &s;ee?" &mdash;Yet when I con&s;ulted my heart and affec|tion, I thought there could be nothing greater than to give him up to another. I judged of the merit of my conduct by what it co&s;t me. Thus, without regard to my|&s;elf, without the lea&s;t tender concern for my own &s;ituation, I have admitted no thought, but that of effecting his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There was a time when I hoped to enjoy the &s;ad comfort of &s;eeing him no more: he &s;eemed to have taken &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, and I advi&s;ed him to break off with my friend and me. That was le&s;s cruel, in my opinion, than the labourious ta&s;k I had taken upon me. Indeed I &s;u&s;pected he was at this time in love
<PB N="65" REF="022876_0267_0FBA9D091E3EEB80">
with madam C * * * *, but he would not own it.</P>
<P>In the mean while I was attentive to every thing that happened. I watched all his &s;teps and motions, and was ready to magnify eve|ry fault he committed, through the de&s;ire I had of finding him guilty; and indeed I was not in humour to invent excu&s;es for him.</P>
<P>But, at la&s;t, after an eclairci&s;&s;ement, he was reconciled, and became fonder than ever of my friend. I now found how cut|ting it was to know the object of our affec|tions attached to &s;omething perfect; yet, far from allowing my intere&s;t to encroach on the ju&s;tice I owed my friend, my delicacy, and fear of being wanting to her, increa&s;ed her merit with me. Ever &s;ince they admitted me into their confidence, I cannot reproach my&s;elf with having once thought of what would have been for my own advantage. All my advice has been &s;incere, and has &s;erved their intere&s;ts again&s;t my own heart; &s;o that the greate&s;t pa&s;&s;ion that ever was, has all along been &s;ub&s;ervient to friend&s;hip. I have thought only of conquering my incli|nations, and puni&s;hing my&s;elf for a pa&s;&s;ion, which it was not in my power to &s;uppre&s;s, &s;ince the heart involuntarily yields to impre&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>On a time, the like would fain have per&s;uaded me he had changed his mind, and was always telling me things very much to my friend's di&s;advantage. This lo&s;t him my
<PB N="66" REF="022876_0268_0FBA9D0AA94F6C98">
e&s;teem. He redoubled his complai&s;ance to me: when &s;he was pre&s;ent, he would &s;eem fonder of me, than of her: he offered me a preference which might have flattered my vanity. He followed me in all places; he grew jealous of every thing that came near me, and his jealou&s;y was real, for he would have been very unwilling to lo&s;e me. But he conducted a pa&s;&s;ion and a de&s;ign alike; a per&s;on le&s;s upon her guard might have mi&s;taken the one for the other, but my mind could &s;ee all his faults, though my heart was not yet &s;en&s;ible of them.&mdash;</P>
<P>If I had not &s;poke, during this long nar|rative, it was becau&s;e I really had not power to do it; and my friend, quite intent upon her &s;tory, had not taken notice of the con|dition I was in all the while. But now, un|able to bear any longer, I gave a &s;hriek, and cried out,&mdash;It is enough. O! tell me no more;&mdash;and with that, the violent con&s;traint I had put upon my&s;elf, having quite exhau&s;t|ed my &s;pirits, I &s;unk down in a &s;woon, and was a long while in the arms of my women without recovering from my fit; but, to my misfortune, they recalled me at la&s;t to life.</P>
<P>Scarce had I opened my eyes, and began to recover my &s;pirits, but a great noi&s;e and bu&s;tle was heard about the hou&s;e, and &s;ome of my maids left me to run and &s;ee what it might be. But as they did not return, and the loud cries continued, I leaned upon the arm of one of them, and &s;taggered towards
<PB N="67" REF="022876_0269_0FBA9D0E0B2CAFF0">
the place from whence they proceeded. Ju&s;t as I got to the hall, I &s;aw four men bringing in another bathed in his blood, whom, as he turned his head towards me, I knew to be the prince. This &s;ight almo&s;t rivetted me to the ground; but, making an effort, I moved forwards to follow the mournful &s;pec|tacle. They laid him on a couch in the par|lour, and I made &s;igns to the &s;ervants to run for help, for I could &s;carce &s;peak. The prince &s;eeing me, turned his expiring eyes towards me, and &s;aid,&mdash;I have not been able to touch your heart, madam, nor convince you of my love: I &s;hall, however, die con|tented, if in my la&s;t moments I can per|&s;uade you that no one ever loved you &s;o truly as I have, though a more happy man puts me in the condition I am now in.&mdash;At this in&s;tant the eyes of all pre&s;ent, who were not a few, fla&s;hed upon me with indigna|tion, but I was yet more hateful to my&s;elf than to them; and Leonora, who came run|ning at the noi&s;e, &s;eeing my condition, drag|ged me away from this di&s;mal &s;ight.</P>
<P>I was led up to my chamber. I begged of her, however, to go and take care of the prince, and to &s;end away with all expedition for the able&s;t &s;urgeons that could be got. They had already taken care of that, and as we were not at a great di&s;tance from town, they were not long in coming. They examined his wounds, and found them mortal I &s;ent every moment to know his condition, but
<PB N="68" REF="022876_0270_0FBA9D101598F610">
could &s;ee very well by the looks of my wo|men that there was no hopes of him.</P>
<P>My friend came at la&s;t, and, by the grief &s;he expre&s;&s;ed, I gue&s;&s;ed the prince's condi|tion. &mdash;It is the duke, &s;aid &s;he to me, that has fought him,&mdash;Can you, an&s;wered I, be the bearer of &s;uch cruel news:&mdash;Why, re|plied &s;he, you mu&s;t be informed of what is become a public talk, that you may be able to regulate your&s;elf accordingly.&mdash;Though &s;he was in the right, I could not help think|ing her cruel to talk &s;o; but grief is often unju&s;t. I begged her to return to the prince's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and not to leave him.</P>
<P>I then withdrew to my clo&s;et, with one of my women, in whom I confided mo&s;t, and, throwing my&s;elf on a couch, &s;aid, "I have nothing more to do in this world, and yet am not allowed to bring death to my relief! What a cruelty to be obliged to &s;upport life under &s;uch circum&s;tances!&mdash;But, come; I have always depended upon your attach|ment to me; follow me. I can no longer endure the &s;ight of human kind.&mdash;Whither, madam, mu&s;t we go? replied &s;he.&mdash;No mat|ter where, an&s;wered I, provided I avoid the eyes of all my acquaintance." The girl en|deavoured to oppo&s;e my de&s;ign, but to no purpo&s;e. I opened a door on the back &s;tairs that led to the garden, and was going out, when &s;he &s;topped me, by telling me how im|proper it would be to go away with the cloaths I had on, and all my jewels about me, de|&s;iring
<PB N="69" REF="022876_0271_0FBA9D115E8DF9C8">
me to &s;tay at lea&s;t till &s;he had dre&s;&s;ed me in one of her plaine&s;t &s;uits. I was per|&s;uaded, and bid her make ha&s;te, not being able to tarry a moment longer in this fatal hou&s;e. "But, will you not wait the utmo&s;t of the prince's fate, re&s;umed &s;he again, and mu&s;t not that, madam, regulate your de&s;tiny? &mdash;Alas, an&s;wered I, do&s;t thou not hear the di&s;mal &s;hrieks of the whole family, too ex|pre&s;&s;ive of his not having one moment longer to live."</P>
<P>Saying the&s;e words, I flew down &s;tairs. We pa&s;&s;ed the garden without meeting any body, and got out by a back door that open|ed into a large wood. The day was begin|ning to clo&s;e: I walked &s;ome time without uttering a word: &s;hame and fear &s;unk all my &s;pirits. At la&s;t, quite &s;pent and overcome, I fell to the ground, and leaned my head on the lap of the woman that attended me. The poor creature was incon&s;olable to &s;ee me in that condition. She &s;poke, but I neither an&s;wered, nor hearkened to her. The night grew dark and di&s;mal. Overpowered by grief and wearine&s;s, I fell a&s;leep as I lay, for nature will take care of her&s;elf, and will lo&s;e nothing of her dues.</P>
<P>I opened my eyes ju&s;t as the day began to break, and my misfortunes glaring afre&s;h with the light, I was filled with horror when I &s;aw them di&s;tinctly. I recalled them all to my mind. I lo&s;e an accompli&s;hed prince,
<PB N="70" REF="022876_0272_0FBA9D12E21288C0">
&s;aid I; I have not loved him, when his pa&s;|&s;ion, meeting with a return of mine, might have made us happy, and I adore him now I am on the point of lo&s;ing him! Mercile&s;s love means to revenge him, and make me the object of its mo&s;t cruel per&s;ecutions.&mdash; And by what hand do I lo&s;e him? By the hand of a perfidious man, who perhaps, has never loved me. I have been the victim of his vanity. My life, my reputation, all is to be enveloped in the odium of guilt. I &s;hall be confounded with tho&s;e of my &s;ex, who have for&s;aken glory and forfeited their honor. What a heart-breaking &s;tory for a father, who&s;e delight and darling I once was? But in what condition mu&s;t the prince's mo|ther be, &s;he who lived but for him? Mu&s;t it be my fate to involve &s;o many people in my misfortunes? Why do I fly? It would be too happy for me to be &s;acrificed to their ju&s;t re&s;entment."&mdash;And, indeed, in &s;ome moments, I was for going back to offer my|&s;elf to their fury, but then again, &s;hame getting the better of my de&s;perate re&s;olu|tion, I could think of nothing but hiding my&s;elf from their eyes, and &s;eeking &s;ome forlorn cave where I might &s;pend the remain|der of my days.&mdash;"But after all, &s;aid I again to my&s;elf, what is my crime, good God! thou knowe&s;t the bottom of all hearts. An involuntary pa&s;&s;ion hath entered my &s;oul. I have rejected and oppo&s;ed its gratificatica|tions.
<PB N="71" REF="022876_0273_0FBA9D146012BD38">
I never have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed my duty nor mode&s;ty. What then am I puni&s;hed for?"</P>
<P>The young woman that bore me company, was all this while melting into tears. "Alas, madam, &s;aid &s;he, what re&s;olution are you taking? So fair and &s;o young, what are you not going to expo&s;e your&s;elf to?&mdash;Perhaps, replied I, I &s;hall meet with &s;ome friendly vil|lain who will deprive me of a life, which the Deity orders me to retain as a puni&s;hment. No, an&s;wered &s;he, you can find no enemies among&s;t men: but if you will be ruled by me, I have a &s;i&s;ter &s;ettled in a &s;mall town not far off; I will conduct you to her; you will not be known, and will be le&s;s di&s;agree|able there, than thus wandering about from place to place."</P>
<P>I took her advice; we &s;et out, and in a little time arrived at the place, whither &s;he de&s;igned to carry me. Her &s;i&s;ter received us very kindly; I went for her friend, as it had been agreed between us; I found them bu&s;y in marrying one of their children. But, on the wedding-day, as I did not choo&s;e to be &s;een by the company, I went out early in the morning, with my companion, under pre|tence of taking an airing, and, walking by the edge of a little hill, I &s;aw a wood. I took a fancy to go into it, and perceiving a hutt, which my friend told me was an her|mitage, I went up to it, and found it open. A &s;hepherd, that was attending his flock
<PB N="72" REF="022876_0274_0FBA9D17945EFF10">
near the place, informed us, that the hermit, who u&s;ed to inhabit it, was thought to be lately dead in going his rounds about the country. Upon this information, I &s;tepped in, and finding it convenient for my pur|po&s;e, cried out immediately to my maid, "This is a dwelling kind fortune offers me; here I am determined to &s;pend the remainder of my &s;orrowful days." I have accordingly put my project in execution, and, to this day, ladies, no body but you have been here to interrupt my &s;olitude and grief.</P>
