<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the fooli&s;h actions a per&s;on can commit, I think that of making an apology for a voluntary error, is the mo&s;t ridiculous; therefore, tho' I have taken up my pen to write a pre|face, I am utterly at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay.</P>
<P>If it is true that "Good wine needs no bu&s;h, and a good play no Epi|logue," then mu&s;t it be equally cer|tain, that a good book requires no preface&mdash;and this a&s;&s;ertion acknow|ledged to be true, in what an awk|ward
<PB N="ii" REF="027654_0004_0FD567CB50B3F488">
predicament do I &s;tand, &s;ince to publi&s;h this work without a pre|face, will be tacitly to infer, that it is good and needs no recommendation, and &s;o be de&s;ervedly cen&s;ured as a conceited &s;cribler.</P>
<P>Should I write a preface and con|demn the performance, confe&s;s it has innumerable faults, and reque&s;t the reader's pity and patience, I not only prepo&s;&s;e&s;s them again&s;t it, but acknow|ledge my&s;elf an idiot, for &s;uffering it to meet the public eye, in &s;uch an imper|fect &s;tate. What then am I to &s;ay, or how fill up tho&s;e few pages nece&s;&s;ary to be placed at the beginning of a book?</P>
<P>Shall I tell the reader my de&s;ign in publi&s;hing the&s;e volumes? I will; It was an anxious de&s;ire to &s;ee all my dear country-women as truly amiable as they are univer&s;ally acknowledged beautiful; it was a wi&s;h to convince
<PB N="iii" REF="027654_0005_0FD56795545B6918">
them that true happine&s;s can never be met with in the temple of di&s;&s;ipation and folly, &s;he flies the glare of fa&s;hion, and the midnight revel, and dwells on|ly in the heart con&s;cious of performing its duty, and is the con&s;tant compani|on of tho&s;e, who, content with the &s;tation in which it has plea&s;ed Provi|dence to place them, entirely free from envy or malice, make it their whole &s;tudy to cultivate tho&s;e amiable virtues which will render them at once beloved, admired and e&s;teemed, by all who know them.</P>
<P>Whether I have executed this de&s;ign well or ill, mu&s;t be hereafter deter|mined, not only by tho&s;e partial friends who&s;e kind encouragement prompted me to &s;ubmit the&s;e pages to the in&s;pec|tion of the public: but, a-well-a-day for me, I mu&s;t al&s;o be judged by &s;ome &s;age critic, who, "with &s;pectacle on no&s;e, and pouch by's &s;ide," with

lengthened vi&s;age and contemptuous &s;mile, &s;its down to review the literary productions of a <HI>woman.</HI> He turns over a few pages, and then
<Q><L>Catching the Author at &s;ome that or therefore,</L>
<L>At once condemne her without why or wherefore,</L></Q></P>
<P>Then, alas! what may not be my fate? who&s;e education, as a female, was nece&s;&s;arily circum&s;cribed, who&s;e little knowledge has been &s;imply gleaned from pure nature, and who, on a &s;ubject of &s;uch importance, write as I feel, with enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty of placing a poem at the beginning of the work, which was publi&s;hed &s;ome few years &s;ince in the novel Victoria, and as ma|ny parents utterly forbid their daugh|ters reading any of that &s;pecies of writing, I thought I &s;hould readily be excu&s;ed for introducing it here.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="027654_0007_0FD5679703179488">
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have neither &s;uffi|cient conceit or fortitude to enable me to hear, unmoved, the deci&s;ion of <HI>judicious</HI> critici&s;m; yet, con&s;cious that I never wrote a line that would convey a wrong idea to the head, or a corrupt wi&s;h to the heart, I &s;it down &s;ati&s;fied with the purity of my intentions, and leave it to the happy envied cla&s;s of mortals, who have received a liberal education, to write with that ta&s;te and elegance which can only be acquired by a thorough knowledge of the cla&s;&s;ics.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF MENTORIA.</HEAD>
<P>MENTORIA, or rather Helena A&s;kham, was the only child of a brave &s;oldier, who, though born to move in but an humble &s;phere, had courage, magnanimity, and fortitude, that might have become a &s;taff officer, but he never ro&s;e to higher rankthan a &s;erjeant, in which &s;tation he acquitted him&s;elf with &s;o much honor that he was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed by his &s;uperiors, and be|loved by his equals. He was, at an early age, married to the daughter of a reputable trade&s;man, who preferring the hard&s;hips of war, to a &s;eparation from her hu&s;band, re&s;olutely followed him to every campaign. It was at the frege of Quebec, that our gallant veteran was wounded and left dead on the field: his faithful partner, unable to &s;upport the &s;hocking tidings which were abruptly conveyed to her, fell into premature labour, and in giving birth to a female infant, rendered up her own life.</P>
<P>Colonel Dormer was acquainted with the cir|cum&s;tance, and determined to protect the poor little orphan&mdash;ordered it to be provided with a nur&s;e; and when he wrote to England, informed his &s;i&s;|ter, Lady Winworth, of the charge he had under|taken,
<PB N="16" REF="027654_0016_0FD567D81CCEE890">
reque&s;ting &s;he would permit the little He|lena to be &s;ent over to be educated with her daugh|ters. Her lady&s;hip acquie&s;ced, and Helena ar|rived &s;afe in England, when only two years old, and was immediately admitted into the nur&s;ery a|mong the little Winworths, and as &s;he grew up enjoyed with them the benefit of a polite and liberal education.</P>
<P>The young Lord Winworth, as he advanced towards manhood, could not behold the young orphan without &s;ome emotions of tenderne&s;s, He|lena was plea&s;ing in her per&s;on, and elegant in her manners, but &s;he was endowed with di&s;cernment and &s;en&s;e far &s;uperior to the generality of young women of her age. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility enough to be unable to li&s;ten with coldne&s;s and inatten|tion to the ardent profe&s;&s;ions of a young noble|man, who to the advantages of birth and fortune, added a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing figure, and every polite ac|compli&s;hment&mdash;but &s;he knew that he was extreme|ly young, and that, in all probability, however eager at that time to enter into indi&s;&s;oluble engage|ments, he would hereafter repent his precipi|tancy, and regret that he had not matched with one more &s;uitable in rank and fortune. She al&s;o reflected that &s;he &s;hould, by accepting him, di&s;|appoint the hopes of his mother, and prove her|&s;elf ungrateful to a woman who had ever treated; her with maternal tenderne&s;s, "And &s;hall I,"
<PB N="17" REF="027654_0017_0FD567A30EB22178">
&s;aid &s;he, <Q>for the gratification of a pa&s;&s;ion which has perhaps aro&s;e from childi&s;h fondne&s;s, and only gains &s;trength by not being oppo&s;ed, entail on my&s;elf the anger of my be&s;t benefac|tors, and lay my&s;elf open to the &s;neers of the world, by matching &s;o far above my expecta|tions, nay, will not my hu&s;band be laughed at for rai&s;ing a poor orphan to his rank and title. I am determined to &s;tifle this ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion, and to inform my Lady of the unfortunate at|tachment of her &s;on.</Q></P>
<P>This judicious re&s;olution &s;he immediately put in execution. Lady Winworth li&s;tened to her with a mixture of &s;urpri&s;e and admiration. "My dear Helena," &s;aid &s;he, "you &s;hall never want a friend while I exi&s;t. This generous conduct has rendered you more amiable than ever. My &s;on is but a boy, I will &s;end him abroad, and in all human probability a few years &s;pent at &s;ome of the gaye&s;t Courts in Europe, will entirely era|dicate this youthful <HI>penchant."</HI></P>
<P>When the young gentleman was informed of his mother's de&s;ire that he &s;hould travel, he flew to Helena, and earne&s;tly entreated her to con&s;ent to a private marriage before his departure. She laughed at his importunity, though her little heart was ready to rebel, and &s;he &s;ound to laugh (how|ever repugnant to her feelings) was the only way
<PB N="18" REF="027654_0018_0FD567D98AF505F0">
to avoid an affecting interview. Her mirth piqued him, "You do not love me, Helena," &s;aid he. "I never told you I did, my Lord." "But your looks, your actions, have contributed to make me think you did." "Why, my good Lord," &s;aid &s;he &s;miling, "I do love you mo&s;t affectionately, and wi&s;h for nothing more than to &s;ee you happy." "Then why not con&s;ent to our immediate union?" cried he eagerly." Becau&s;e I love you as a bro|ther, and hope to &s;ee you, when you return, married to &s;ome lady of birth, merit, and for|tune, and to figure as bride-maid on the occa|&s;ion." "Unaccountable girl," &s;aid he, peevi&s;h|ly, "then only promi&s;e me to remain &s;ingle till my return." "Indeed I &s;hall not, my Lord, for I have no intention to wear a willow garland; and &s;ure I am, that &s;hould I make &s;uch a promi&s;e, we &s;hould both repent it before the year was out." "Nay, Madam," &s;aid he, angrily, "if you are of &s;o light a di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;" "It is even &s;o," cried &s;he, with affected vivacity, "therefore, as you are warned, pray beware, and think no more of &s;o trifling and incon&s;tant a character."</P>
<P>When Helena retired to her own apartment, &s;he gave free vent to her feelings; and in order to avoid the pain of parting, reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion of Lady Winworth, to pay a vi&s;it to a young lady, who lived &s;ome miles from town. The old Lady &s;aw the propriety of her reque&s;t, and immediately
<PB N="19" REF="027654_0019_0FD567A52DA98B70">
granted it. She therefore departed the next morn|ing, leaving only a card, wi&s;hing his lord&s;hip health and much plea&s;ure in the cour&s;e of his tra|vels. So &s;triking a proof of her indifference in|crea&s;ed his re&s;entment, and he left England with|out any of tho&s;e pangs which he imagined he &s;hould &s;uffer when &s;eparated form his Helena.</P>
<P>The event proved that Helena was right; for when Lord Winworth returned, he brought with him a bride, lovely, amiable, and his equal in rank and fortune. When his lord&s;hip left Eng|land, he took with him a young gentleman, as a travelling companion; this gentleman did not &s;ee Helena previous to his departure, but at his return, charmed with her innocent vivacity and judicious conduct, reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to pay his addre&s;&s;es; which was immediately granted, and on their union he was pre&s;ented with a po&s;t under govern|ment, which he enjoyed till his death.</P>
<P>Helena being then left in rather &s;traitened cir|cum&s;tances, was reque&s;ted to become governe&s;s to the daughters of Lord Winworth; &s;he con&s;ented, on condition that they might be permitted to retire with her into the country.

<HEAD>LETTER I. MENTORIA, TO THE MISS WINWORTHS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER being accu&s;tomed to the &s;ociety of my dear Mi&s;s Winworths for fifteen years, how &s;olitary and comfortle&s;s is my &s;ituation. I every day feel my lo&s;s more &s;everely. I look at the harp&s;ichord, and expect my Sophia to come and practi&s;e her favorite le&s;&s;ons. I take up a book, and almo&s;t unknown to my&s;elf, call on Emily to read &s;ome pa&s;&s;age that plea&s;es or inter|e&s;ts
<PB N="21" REF="027654_0021_0FD567A68D2B3358">
me. I mi&s;s the dear lively &s;allies of Ger|trude, and the innocent prattle of Letitia: but though I &s;o &s;everely feel the privation of your beloved &s;ociety, I am not &s;o &s;elfi&s;h as to wi&s;h you again in the &s;hades of Cambray. I am certain of the nece&s;&s;ity of your taking a part in the active &s;cenes of life, and as your dear mother is now no more, your father will nece&s;&s;arily require the cheerfulne&s;s of his children to brighten his &s;oli|tary hours, and it was but ju&s;t that my beloved girls &s;hould appear in the &s;tation they were born to ornament.</P>
<P>I highly comment the prudence of your fa|ther, in taking Mrs. Clairville into his family, to be your <HI>chaperons</HI> on your fir&s;t entrance into fa&s;hionable circles. She is a woman who has &s;een a great deal of polite life, has ever retained an unblemi&s;hed reputation, and though reduced by mi&s;fortune to be glad to accept the &s;ituation your father offered her, has ever been received as a gue&s;t who&s;e pre&s;ence conferred an obligation, by &s;ome of the fir&s;t families in England.</P>
<P>Though &s;eparated from you, I &s;hall, as you de&s;ire, &s;till continue your preceptre&s;s, and &s;hall not at any time &s;cruple to tell you of your faults; for partial as I am to your virtues, I am by no means blind to tho&s;e errors to which human na|ture is ever &s;ubject, and which, if not timely era|dicated,
<PB N="22" REF="027654_0022_0FD567DC8A2EA4C8">
will gain an a&s;cendancy over your mind, and entirely hide tho&s;e amiable qualities, which at pre&s;ent form the mo&s;t &s;triking traits in your character.</P>
<P>And to begin&mdash;I feel my&s;elf greatly hurt and offended by the letter I received from Gertrude, &s;ince your arrival in London. When it was fir&s;t delivered into my hands, a joyful &s;en&s;ation dif|fu&s;ed it&s;elf over my heart, and while reading the tender expre&s;&s;ions of grateful affection that &s;eemed to flow &s;pontaneous from your pen, it expanded with plea&s;ure; but when I came to the&s;e words, "My father received us with great affection, and has been very bountiful in pre&s;ents, cloaths, pocket-money, &amp;c. but yet for all that, my dear Madam, I cannot feel that perfect affection for him, which I know I ought. He has a great ma|ny peculiarities, &s;ome of them by no means plea|&s;ing; and my &s;i&s;ters all agree, he is very much of the Ba&s;haw."</P>
<P>Good Heavens! &s;aid I, and is this all the fruit I am likely to reap from the pains I have taken to in&s;til into the minds of tho&s;e dear girls a ju&s;t idea of what is meant by the words, Filial Duty. That the very fir&s;t letter I receive &s;hould point at the little foibles of a parent, who they ac|knowledge received them with affection, and has been extremely bountiful to them. Believe me,
<PB N="23" REF="027654_0023_0FD567AE2C978318">
my dear children, if you wi&s;h to pa&s;s through life with any degree of plea&s;ure to your&s;elves, you mu&s;t early learn to &s;ubmit, without murmur|ing, to the will of your father; be blind to his errors, or if they are &s;o glaring that you can|not avoid &s;eeing them, never expo&s;e them, or &s;uffer others to &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of him in your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t &s;acrifice your own wi&s;hes to his, you mu&s;t &s;tudy his happine&s;s and ea&s;e, and in &s;o doing will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly promote your own.</P>
<P>You no doubt remember the amiable Mrs. Railton, who favored me with her company for a few weeks la&s;t &s;ummer. I ye&s;terday received news of her death, and as I am certain example is ever more efficacious than precept, I will give you a &s;light &s;ketch of her hi&s;tory, as a model by which every young woman who wi&s;hes to pro|mote her own felicity, will regulate her con|duct.</P>
<P>Mr. George Campbell was the younge&s;t &s;on of a wealthy baronet, who having &s;everal livings in his gift, be&s;ides good intere&s;t at Court, brought him up to the church, with the &s;anguine expecta|tion of one day &s;eeing him a bi&s;hop.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="027654_0024_0FD567E0D655F0F8">
Unfortunately for George, before he had at|tained his twenty-third year he became attached to a young lady, who had every requi&s;ite to render the married &s;tate happy, but money&mdash;and money being the old gentleman's darling idol, he con&s;equently thought &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no requi&s;ite worthy the wife of his &s;on; but George was too far engaged to retreat with honor, he therefore told his father, he was re&s;olved upon the union, and in a few days pre&s;ented his be|loved Loui&s;a to entreat his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>When Sir James found they were really mar|ried, he thought it was in vain to fly in a pa&s;&s;ion, he received them cordially, and gave them, an univer&s;al invitation to his hou&s;e, but in his heart he never forgave them. The livings were di&s;|po&s;ed of to other people, and at his death he left the whole of his e&s;tates to his elde&s;t &s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Campbell had only a curacy of about eighty pounds a year, and as regular as the year came round, his wife pre&s;ented him with a child. Poverty took up her habitation among them, and he bitterly regretted having, by an act of di&s;obe|dience, not only brought on him&s;elf his father's di&s;plea&s;ure, but involved an amiable woman, whom he loved, in a &s;cene of penury and di&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e reflections &s;our'd his di&s;po&s;ition, he became peevi&s;h and moro&s;e, nay &s;ometimes went &s;o far, as
<PB N="25" REF="027654_0025_0FD567A8C9EE2510">
to reproach his wife as the cau&s;e of his abject &s;itu|ation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Campbell took great care to in&s;til into the minds of her children the re&s;pect and affec|tion due from them to their father. "My dear children," &s;he would often &s;ay, "be a&s;&s;ured, a breach of filial duty is ever attended with regret, and in general with mi&s;fortune."</P>
<P>Loui&s;a was the elde&s;t of five children, &s;he was mild, meek, and affectionate. She attentively li&s;tened to the precepts of her mother, and laid them up in her heart as an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure. Mr. Campbell's temper grew &s;o extremely bad, that not only his wife, but his children came in for a &s;hare of his ill-humour. Loui&s;a, in parti|cular, was &s;ure to be wrong, in whatever &s;he &s;aid or did, and it was &s;eldom &s;he was favoured with a kind or affectionate word, yet her manners were &s;o amiable and her form &s;o lovely, that though &s;he laboured under the di&s;advantages of a narrow education and extreme poverty, her company was courted by &s;ome of the genteele&s;t families in the village, but in compliance with her father's ill|humour, &s;he was &s;eldom allowed to &s;tir from home.</P>
<P>When Loui&s;a had reached her &s;eventeenth year, Lady Mary Campbell, a di&s;tant relation of her
<PB N="26" REF="027654_0026_0FD567E28E2425D0">
father's came on a vi&s;it to a family who re&s;ided in the &s;ame village, Loui&s;a's good qualities were re&s;ounded to Lady Mary from every mouth, and all unanimou&s;ly agreed it was a pity &s;o lovely a girl &s;hould be buried in ob&s;curity and lo&s;t for want of a proper education.</P>
<P>Lady Mary was naturally of a humane di&s;po&s;i|tion, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee Mi&s;s Campbell, and when introduced to her, finding her even &s;u|perior to what &s;he had been taught to expect, made her an offer of going with her to London.</P>
<P>This was a propo&s;al, too much to Loui&s;a's ad|vantage to be refu&s;ed; the invitation was accepted, and the vi&s;it prolonged for three years, during which time Loui&s;a had an opportunity of im|proving her&s;elf in the ornamental as well as u&s;e|ful branches of education.</P>
<P>Mrs. Campbell, who had for many years la|boured under an evident decline, was now &s;um|moned home by that power, who had been plea&s;ed in this life to try her with long and heavy afflic|tions. Lady Mary carried Loui&s;a to receive the dying ble&s;&s;ing, and pay the la&s;t duties to her ami|able mother.&mdash;That fini&s;hed, &s;he propo&s;ed her return to London. The lovely girl, penetrated with gratitude for the many favours &s;he had re|ceived and tenderly attached to her generous be|nefactre&s;s,
<PB N="27" REF="027654_0027_0FD567AD46D84220">
with difficulty re&s;trained her tears, while &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed her&mdash;</P>
<P>"Think me not ungrateful, dear Madam, if I beg to remain with any father; my brothers and &s;i&s;ters are engaged in learning occupations which may enable them to pa&s;s through life with in|du&s;try and without reproach. I cannot leave my father in this &s;olitude after &s;o recent an afflic|tion: he has been for many years u&s;ed to the un|remitting attention and tenderne&s;s of my excellent mother, I mu&s;t not &s;uffer him too &s;everely to feel her lo&s;s, but endeavour, as far as in my power, by affection and a&s;&s;iduity, to &s;upply her place."</P>
<P>"And can you, my dear Loui&s;a, &s;aid her La|dy&s;hip, &s;o ea&s;ily forego the ea&s;e and plenty you have enjoyed with me, to live a life of penury and labour, and that for a man, who, though he is your father, I mu&s;t &s;ay, does not de&s;erve &s;uch at|tention&mdash;did he not always treat you with unme|rited har&s;hne&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Hold, my dear Madam," &s;aid Loui&s;a, if, as you think, my father has not behaved to me with the kindne&s;s of a parent, it by on means re|lea&s;es me from my duty to him; had he a thou|&s;and errors he is my father &s;till; as &s;uch I am called upon by nature and religion to do every
<PB N="28" REF="027654_0028_0FD567E4CAF12D90">
thing in my power to render his life comfortable; if my endeavours to plea&s;e can awaken his affec|tion, I &s;hall think my&s;elf amply repaid; if not, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, of having performed my duty, will give me a &s;ati&s;faction which no future event can ever rob me of."</P>
<P>It was in vain Lady Mary urged her to return&mdash;the lovely. elegant, accompli&s;hed Loui&s;a, pre|ferred a low roofed man&s;ion, &s;canty meals, and attendance on a &s;ick peevi&s;h father, to the lofty apartments, plenteous table, and variety of amu&s;e|ments, &s;he might have enjoyed with Lady Mary. She attended him to the la&s;t, and by her tender &s;o|licitude and affection &s;moothed the down-hill of his life, and cheared and comforted him in the mo&s;t painful illne&s;s by her unaffected piety; he was moved by her filial duty, all the father ru&s;hed up|on his &s;oul, he ble&s;&s;ed her with his parting breath, and expired in her arms.</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, enquire, what benefit Lou|i&s;a reaped from this rigid performance of her duty? The que&s;tion is ea&s;ily an&s;wered. She gained a contented happy mind, &s;erenity dwelt in her heart and chearfulne&s;s beamed from her eyes.</P>
<P>She had a genteel competency left her at Lady Mary's death, married a de&s;erving man, and
<PB N="29" REF="027654_0029_0FD567AFA7717150">
&s;hone as con&s;picuou&s;ly in the characters of a wife and mother, as &s;he had done as a daughter&mdash;&s;he lived beloved by all and died univer&s;ally re|gretted.</P>
<P>Be wi&s;e, my dear children, follow Loui&s;a's ex|ample, &s;o &s;hall your lives be happy and your la&s;t moments peace.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I AM &s;orry, my dear ladies to be under the di&s;|agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of again taking up my pen to reprove,</P>
<P>Your letters to me of late, have arrived &s;o &s;el|dom, and when they do arrive, are &s;o &s;hort, &s;o filled with dre&s;s, vi&s;its, and parties of plea&s;ure, that I almo&s;t doubt whether &s;ome demon has not imitated your hand-writing, to impo&s;e upon me; for I can find no ve&s;tige of tho&s;e &s;entiments I &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;trove to inculcate in your minds while in the &s;hades of Cambray: from the tenor of your letters, I &s;hould imagine you live entirely in a crowd, if &s;o, you certainly have no time to at|tend to tho&s;e improvements I &s;o &s;trongly recom|mended to you not to neglect.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="027654_0030_0FD567E722174798">
You &s;eem al&s;o to have taken an unaccountable di&s;like to Mrs. Clairville. You &s;ay your father is a great deal too partial to her; this appears to me the evident effect of envy or jealou&s;y; your father being perfectly &s;en&s;ible of that lady's merit, and con&s;cious that her &s;ituation in his family is rather humiliating, by treating her with uncom|mon re&s;pect, &s;hews the goodne&s;s of his heart, and &s;ets an example which I &s;hould rejoice to find my dear girls would follow.</P>
<P>Another thing which &s;eriou&s;ly alarms me for your future happine&s;s is, to find you have your friends and &s;ecrets, and form little cotteries, of which neither your father nor Mrs. Clairville have any knowledge; believe me, you cannot be too cautious in the choice of your intimates, many a girl, who&s;e intentions have been perfectly inno|cent, has lo&s;t her reputation, by a&s;&s;ociating with women who&s;e levity has rendered their characters &s;u&s;picious. You cannot find in the whole circle of your acquaintance, a friend &s;o &s;incere as your natural parent, to him you may without re&s;erve, communicate every wi&s;h of your hearts, for tru&s;t me when I &s;ay, every thought you would he&s;itate to reveal to a parent, mu&s;t be totally improper to be harboured in your bo&s;om. Perhaps you will tell me, that having no mother, there are &s;ome emo|tions of the heart, which the natural timidity and delicacy of your &s;ex would render it extremely painful to communicate to a father.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="027654_0031_0FD567B457311E58">
As I am &s;en&s;ible of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, I mu&s;t recommend to you to cho&s;e a friend from among tho&s;e mo&s;t e&s;teemed by your father, let her be &s;ome years older than your&s;elf, (for age, in ge|neral, learn experience in the arts of the world) and by her advice, &s;he may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure guard you from falling a prey to the di&s;&s;imulation of many pretendens to love or friend&s;hip, who will a&s;&s;ume the &s;emblance of attachment, to draw the un&s;u&s;pecting youthful heart into improper con|nections, which too often terminate in their ruin.</P>
<P>A numerous acquaintance is, in general, of dangerous con&s;equence to young women, as it is impo&s;&s;ible but in a multiplicity of characters there may be &s;ome, who&s;e conver&s;ation and example it would be improper to follow, and &s;uch is the frail &s;tate of human nature, that bad habits are ea&s;ily contracted, and can &s;eldom if ever be eradicated. A girl ju&s;t entering the &s;tate of womanhood e&s;|pecially if &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any per&s;onal or men|tal accompli&s;hments, and of an open ingenuous temper is &s;urrounded with innumerable dangers; her reputation is of as delicate a texture, and may be as ea&s;ily injured, as the faire&s;t blo&s;&s;om; the malignant whi&s;perings of envy, or the pe&s;tiferous breath of &s;lander, may in an in&s;tant bla&s;t it; it will droop under the keen eye of &s;u&s;picion, and too often tho&s;e who mo&s;t pretend to admire its &s;weets, will rudely pluck it from its parent &s;talk,
<PB N="32" REF="027654_0032_0FD524451591D9C0">
deprive it of all its beauties, then throw it from them like a loath&s;ome weed, leave it to peri&s;h unpitied and unregarded, and to be trod to the earth by every unfeeling pa&s;&s;enger, who may perhaps ca&s;t on it a look of contempt, and cry, "Behold the once lovely."</P>
<P>There are many women in the world lovely in their per&s;ons, elegant and engaging in their manners, who are yet very improper connections for girls, who wi&s;h to pre&s;erve their reputation un&s;ullied; of this de&s;cription I greatly fear your favorite Matilda is&mdash;the &s;trong di&s;like &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;es at the idea of your bringing either your father or Mrs. Clairville to &s;ee her, convinces me there mu&s;t'be &s;omething in her character which &s;he would not like to have di&s;covered. Remem|ber it was at a public ball you fir&s;t formed an acquaintance with her; that a gentleman intro|duced her to you, and chance afterwards led you in a morning excur&s;ion to ride by her little <HI>chateau;</HI> you confe&s;s &s;he lives in an elegant man|ner, that &s;he is highly accompli&s;hed, and yet is always by her&s;elf. Would any woman of cha|racter and fortune, do you think, live thus re|clu&s;e, have no female friends to a&s;&s;ociate with, no little chearful parties to enliven her &s;olitude, and when &s;he went into public, would &s;he go only accompanied by gentlemen? You &s;ay there is an air of my&s;tery about her; and, believe me, if
<PB N="33" REF="027654_0033_0FD567B58B01EEA0">
that my&s;tery was developed, it would di&s;cover nothing to her advantage. Let me intreat my dear girls to drop the acquaintance, or inform your father of it: if after a proper enquiry con|cerning her character, he &s;hould approve the con|tinuation of your vi&s;its, I &s;hall be happy to find you have &s;o agreeable a member added to your &s;ociety, and &s;everely blame my&s;elf for having judged &s;o har&s;hly.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have &s;o many fears concerning your intimacy with Matilda, had I not, &s;ome years ago, known a very amiable girl, who entirely forfeited her good name, and in the end her life, by a&s;&s;ociating with a woman of light cha|racter.</P>
<P>Harriet Harding had the mi&s;fortune to lo&s;e her mother when very young, and at a very early age took upon her&s;elf the choice of her own acquaint|ance. She had been at the play one night, when a lady in the &s;ame box had &s;hewn her many civi|lities, and at parting gave her a card, and begged to have the honour of &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>Mr. Harding had remarked what pa&s;&s;ed, and on returning home, warned his daughter again&s;t forming any acquaintance with her, as &s;he was a woman publicly kept by a man of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="027654_0034_0FD567E9AD8EF6C0">
Harriet was giddy, thoughtle&s;s and fond of plea&s;ure; chance threw her again in the way of Amelia, and &s;he entirely forgot her fa|ther's injunction. A &s;trict intimacy en&s;ued, &s;he was frequent in her vi&s;its to Amelia, often went with her into public, and was charmed with the incen&s;e of flattery that was offered to her by the men. Mr. Harding had bu&s;ine&s;s which called him to a di&s;tant part of England, Harriet was left mi&s;tre&s;s of her own actions, and cho&s;e this op|portunity to go with Amelia on an excur&s;ion in the country; in this excur&s;ion they were attended by the gentleman who kept Amelia, and one of his friends, who was particular in his attentions to Harriet; the time flew on the wings of plea|&s;ure, and when they returned to town, (Mr. Harding being &s;till ab&s;ent) it was propo&s;ed &s;he &s;hould accompany the party to a ma&s;querade.</P>
<P>Harriet was a &s;tranger to this &s;ort of amu&s;ement, her &s;pirits were exhilerated&mdash;&s;he did not think of leaving it till a late hour, and when &s;he mentioned going home Amelia was not to be found. The gentleman who had been her protector all the evening, begged permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee her home, &s;he con&s;ented, and at the hour of five in the morn|ing arrived at her father's hou&s;e; a &s;ervant who had aro&s;e carly to perform &s;ome particular work let her in, and the gentleman followed her up &s;tairs. She was &s;urpri&s;ed, but could not he &s;o
<PB N="35" REF="027654_0035_0FD567B74A8730C0">
rude as to tell him to leave the hou&s;e; but how was her &s;urpri&s;e increa&s;ed, when throwing a&s;ide his ma&s;k and domino, he proceeded to take li|berties &s;he had ever been u&s;ed to think of with abhorrence. Unable to defend her&s;elf from his in&s;ults, &s;he &s;hrieked aloud, and in a moment her father, who had returned the evening before, bur&s;t into the room&mdash;her &s;hame and terror over|came her, and &s;he fainted; an explanation en|&s;ued between the father and the gentleman who had in&s;ulted her, who &s;hocked at the impropriety of his behaviour a&s;ked Mr. Harding's pardon, and &s;taying till Harriet was recovered, gave her this advice at parting.</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t, my dear young lady, this will be a warning to you in future, how you choo&s;e your intimates. Amelia is a woman &s;o publicly known, that it was next to impo&s;&s;ible for you not to have been acquainted with the lightne&s;s of her charac|ter, I am now fully convinced that you are a wo|man of &s;trict honour, but, believe me, till this day I always thought you a girl who had either no reputation to lo&s;e, or paid very little attention to &s;o material a concern. I am &s;orry to &s;ay there are numbers of per&s;ons, of both &s;exes, who have &s;een you with Amelia, who think the &s;ame, and whom it will be a very difficult matter to convince to the contrary; let me beg of you to break off a connection &s;o derogatory to your honor, and
<PB N="36" REF="027654_0036_0FD567EADAABBA70">
by the future propriety of your conduct regain that reputation, which your intimacy with &s;o in|famous woman has con&s;iderably injured."</P>
<P>Harriet could an&s;wer only with her tears, which flowed plenteou&s;ly, not only at hearing the&s;e di&s;|agreeable truths, but from the reflection, that when the &s;tranger was gone &s;he had &s;till her fa|ther's anger to endure; had this been all, Harriet might have thought her&s;elf happy, as by her fu|ture behaviour &s;he might have hoped to regain his confidence and favour, but the heedle&s;s girl too &s;oon found, that not only her father watched her actions with a &s;u&s;picious eye, but all her female friends received her vi&s;its with coldne&s;s, forbore to return them, and in a &s;hort time entirely dropped her acquaintance; to add to her morti|fication, a young gentleman who had for &s;ome time addre&s;&s;ed her on an honourable &s;core, broke off the connection, and &s;he found her&s;elf as &s;o|litary and as much neglected as though &s;he lived in a de&s;ert."</P>

<P>You &s;ee, my dear girls, Harriet was not natu|rally of a depraved inclination, &s;he &s;hrunk with horror from the fir&s;t approach of vice; her attach|ment to Amelia was founded on a love of plea|&s;ure, &s;he enjoyed every luxury while with her, led a life of indolence, and was continually re|ceiving pre&s;ents of &s;omething to decorate her per|&s;on; the&s;e were indulgences &s;he could not enjoy at home, for though Mr. Harding was a very &s;ub&s;tantial trade&s;man, he would by no means al|low his daughter to launch into extravagance, ei|ther in her hou&s;ekeeping, dre&s;s, or plea&s;ure&mdash;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee every hour u&s;efully employed, and as youth in general are much more found of plea|&s;ure than employment, Harriet was delighted with the acquaintance of a woman in who&s;e &s;o|ciety &s;he could enjoy the one in its utmo&s;t extent, without ever hearing of the other.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Girls,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t I gave you a &s;triking in&s;tance of the dangerous tendency of improper acquaintance; be a&s;&s;ured, there are more women led into errors by the bad precepts and examples of their own &s;ex, than you would be apt to imagine, not only in forfeiting their good name, but every preten|&s;ion to happine&s;s. I do not know how otherwi&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="027654_0039_0FD567BC5B184398">
to account for &s;o many lovely, amiable women entailing mi&s;ery upon them&s;elves and their po&s;te|rity, than by the romantic ideas they entertain of love and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Love, my dear children, is a noble, generous pa&s;&s;ion, and when kept under the guidance of rea|&s;on, exalts and elevates the human &s;oul; but the juvenile mind is apt to mi&s;take a tran&s;ient like|ing, or a &s;udden impul&s;e of gratified vanity, for love; and many a girl from at fir&s;t being plea&s;ed with the company of tho&s;e who indi&s;criminately offer the incen&s;e of adulation to every young fe|male begins to fancy one more particular than the re&s;t, and that one is undoubtedly de&s;igned to be her hu&s;band. From the moment this idea takes place, Mi&s;s is mo&s;t violently in love, &s;leeping or waking the dear youth is continnally in her thoughts, &s;he lives but in his pre&s;ence, when he is ab&s;ent &s;he only exi&s;ts. She unbo&s;oms her&s;elf to &s;ome dear girl nearly of her own age, and &s;he being her friend and confidant, the &s;ecret is to be kept inviolable. For want of &s;ome laudable pur&s;uit to employ her time and engage her attention, &s;he indulges her fooli&s;h <HI>penchant,</HI> which originated fir&s;t in vanity and was afterwards nur&s;ed by fancy, till at length &s;he is in reality attached to a man, who perhaps never entertained a &s;erious thought of her; he marries &s;ome other woman, and Mi&s;s is left to &s;igh at her hard late, com|plain
<PB N="40" REF="027654_0040_0FD567EE9389B580">
of the perfidy of mankind, and indulge in a luxury of delicate ideal mi&s;ery. Nor is this all, her dear and faithful friend betrays her &s;e|cret to all the Mi&s;&s;es of her acquaintance, who (though perhaps guilty of the &s;ame folly them|&s;elves) will not &s;cruple to laugh at what they will term, her indi&s;creet and fooli&s;h conduct.</P>
<P>Though &s;uch a &s;ituation is certainly &s;ufficiently mortifying, yet it is by no means the wor&s;t that may happen. A girl who imagines &s;he mu&s;t be in love with the fir&s;t man who &s;ays a few civil things to her, lays her&s;elf open to the de&s;igns of the object of her ideal pa&s;&s;ion, who if he &s;hould happen to be an artful man, may take advantage of her partiality and credulity, to draw her into indi&s;&s;oluble engagements, which is in general the ca&s;e when there is a fortune in the way, or where that charm is wanting, to plunge her into infamy.</P>
<P>I once knew a girl, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every advantage which could be derived from wealth, beauty, honorable relations, and a polite liberal education, at the early age of eighteen fell a victim to a romantic pa&s;&s;ion, and in the very mo|ment when &s;he &s;acrificed the regard of her friends the hopes of future advancement in life, in &s;hort, every thing that was valuable, &s;he fancied &s;he had done a prai&s;e-worthy action, by evincing her
<PB N="41" REF="027654_0041_0FD567BE0C18D510">
con&s;tancy and di&s;intere&s;ted attachment to the ob|ject of her fir&s;t love.</P>
<P>Belinda Dormer went to the &s;ame &s;chool with me, we contracted a great friend&s;hip for each other, and when the holidays &s;eparated us, by calling each to her re&s;pective home, we trea|&s;ured up every little incident in our memories, whether of pain or plea&s;ure, that when we met we might exchange confidence, and live over our plea&s;ures, or &s;oothe the remembrance of our lit|tle unea&s;ine&s;&s;es by participation.</P>
<P>Bell was a lovely brown girl, elegant in her form, accompli&s;hed in her manners, and lively in her di&s;po&s;ition; her heart was tender and af|fectionate, without the lea&s;t tincture of art or affectation, good-natured, ea&s;y, and credulous. She left &s;chool at the age of &s;eventeen, and was u&s;hered into the world, prepared to admire her, for &s;he was reputed heire&s;s to an immen&s;e for|tune. The Chri&s;tmas before &s;he was taken home, during the holidays, her father gave a hall in honor of her birth-day, a young officer, who&s;e only recommendation was an hand&s;ome per&s;on and polite addre&s;s, and who depended on Mr. Dormer for father advancement in the army, reque&s;ted the honor of her hand, and in the cour&s;e of the evening danced him&s;elf &s;o far in|to her e&s;teem, that &s;he implicitly believed him,
<PB N="42" REF="027654_0042_0FD567F0129FEDD8">
when he told her &s;he was the lovelie&s;t creature in the world, and that he &s;hould be mi&s;erable if &s;he did not &s;uffer him to hope he was not altoge|ther indifferent to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Dormer had placed great confidence in this young man, he had taken him from a &s;tate of abject penury, placed him at a genteel academy, and when he imagined him capable of di&s;charg|ing his duty, as became a man of honor and a &s;oldier, purcha&s;ed him an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion in a regiment going to America, where he rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the rank of captain, and was now ju&s;t returned to England. Mr. Dormer ever intend|ed to be the friend and patron of young Horton, but never dreamt of his a&s;piring to his daughter, he therefore gave him a general invitation to his hou&s;e, nor once thought but that his gratitude and honor would be &s;ufficient to prevent his forming any improper de&s;igns on the per&s;on or fortune of Belinda, be&s;ides he was near ten years older than Mi&s;s Dormer, and therefore there was no fear of an attachment taking place between them.</P>
<P>But Horton was an artful ambitious man, he long had wi&s;hed to enjoy the benefits of an in|dependent fortune, and looked on Belinda as the per&s;on by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he could obtain &s;o de&s;irable an acqui&s;ition. He had always been
<PB N="43" REF="027654_0043_0FD567BF4AEFD5D0">
&s;ucce&s;sful with the ladies, but the true &s;tate of his finances being generally known, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ucceed in any matrimonial &s;cheme, except it was with the innocent and un&s;u&s;picious, and Belinda was exactly &s;uited for his purpo&s;e. He flattered, &s;wore, knelt, wept, and acted every extravagance, till the &s;imple girl made &s;ome confe&s;&s;ions in his favor, he then prevailed on her to keep her partiality a &s;ecret from her mo|ther, for he knew that her parents de&s;igned her for the bride of a young nobleman, who was at at that time abroad. He expatiated on the folly and cruelty of parents choo&s;ing partners for their children, and launched out in prai&s;e of di&s;in|tere&s;ted love, talked of the union of &s;ouls, and a deal of &s;oft &s;entimental non&s;en&s;e, about a life of uninterruped felicity with the object of her own choice, though &s;he was to live in the meane&s;t cottage.</P>
<P>When Belinda returned to &s;chool, &s;he fancied her&s;elf as much in love as it was po&s;&s;ible for any &s;entimental heroine to be, and declared, for her &s;weet Horton &s;he would be coutent to relinqui&s;h all the elegancies and indulgencies to which &s;he had ever been a cu&s;tomed, and live upon the coar&s;e&s;t viands, in an ob&s;cure man&s;ion. It was in vain I endeavoured to argue my young friend out of the&s;e ridiculous notions, &s;he remained
<PB N="44" REF="027654_0044_0FD567F189A803F0">
fixed in her determination, to marry Horton or not marry at all.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for Belinda, at that time I had as chimerical ideas of friend&s;hip as &s;he had of love, and &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed it an inexcu&s;a|ble breach of confidence, to di&s;cover her de|&s;igns to her mother, though it would have been the be&s;t proof of real friend&s;hip I could po&s;&s;i|bly have given her.</P>
<P>She was taken from &s;chool with a de&s;ign of being introduced to Lord Gaymore; &s;he went home one day, had a meeting with Hor|ton the next, and the third morning by five o'clock &s;et off in a chai&s;e and four to Scotland, without having even &s;een the per&s;on her parents &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;hed her to be united with.</P>
<P>When they returned, Mr. Dormer, though highly offended at the ra&s;h conduct of Belinda, and the black ingratitude of Horton, forgave them, and &s;ettled an hand&s;ome annuity on her, but told them the bulk of his fortune was en|tailed on Lord Gaymore, (who was the neare&s;t male relation) in ca&s;e of her refu&s;al of him.</P>
<P>Belinda was &s;oon &s;ettled, and I took an early opportunity to vi&s;it her; I &s;ound her, according to her own words, "&s;uperlatively happy! Her
<PB N="45" REF="027654_0045_0FD567C241CF64E8">
Horton was the kinde&s;t be&s;t of hu&s;bands, her home was a paradi&s;e, &s;he would not be Lady Gaymore for the world! What was affluence? Nothing when put in competition with love and Horton." But this was the language of ro|mance.</P>
<P>I called on her again in about &s;ix months. I found her fitting in extreme di&s;habille, her face was pale, her eyes &s;unk, and as &s;he pen&s;ively leaned her head upon her hand a tear now and then &s;tole down her cheek. I a&s;ked tenderly the cau&s;e of her &s;orrow. "Oh! my friend," &s;aid &s;he, "I have undone my&s;elf! Horton is no longer the attentive tender hu&s;band." I, &s;miling, told her, that &s;he mu&s;t not expect the &s;olicitude of the lover to la&s;t for life, but be content with the more calm and la&s;ting e&s;teem of a friend.</P>
<P>"Alas!" replied Belinda, "I have no friend, I find, too late, my violent attachment to Hor|ton was the romantic whim of a lively imagina|tion; and that the union of &s;ouls, the &s;imilarity of &s;entiment, which I had vainly thought would make the fetters of Hymen ea&s;y, and even delight|ful, exi&s;ted only in my ideas. Horton has nei|ther &s;en&s;e, good nature, or politene&s;s at home, though he appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e amiable quali|ties &s;o eminently abroad. He is extravagant, vain, and too fond of his own per&s;on, to be long
<PB N="46" REF="027654_0046_0FD567F4A3D54378">
attached to any woman, except his pa&s;&s;ion is excited by intere&s;ted motives; he has not &s;cru|pled to own, it was the hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing my for|tune alone induced him to addre&s;s me, and that had he known the e&s;tate was entailed on Lord Gaymore, he never would have troubled him&s;elf to make love to a puny, baby-faced girl, when there were &s;o many fine women who would have thought them&s;elves honoured by his notice. In|deed, continued &s;he, redoubling her tears, he &s;eldom comes home but I am in&s;ulted with a re|cital of the many women of fa&s;hion who make him advances, and I am debarred of every inno|cent amu&s;ement, &s;tinted in my dre&s;s, and almo&s;t kept without pocket-money, that he may appear with elegance in company, and have plenty of money to la vi&s;h in expen&s;ive plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>I was greatly chagrined to find my dear young friend had really &s;uch ju&s;t cau&s;e for complaint, but endeavoured to comfort her, and lead her to hope, that by con&s;tant affection, attention, and good-humour, &s;he might recal her wanderer, and awaken in his bo&s;om reciprocal tenderne&s;s. But I found by her reply, the&s;e were fallacious hopes.</P>
<P>She had been to vi&s;it her parents, and had there formed an acquaintance with Lord Gay|more, Unfortunately the ill-fated Belinda di&s;|covered
<PB N="47" REF="027654_0047_0FD567C30FA09C40">
this once dreaded nobleman to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of every real virtue, of which Horton had a&s;&s;umed the &s;emblance; his per&s;on was hand|&s;ome, without being effeminate, his heart glowed with humanity and benevolence; he was a man of refined &s;en&s;e and &s;trict honor, with a mind enlightened and expanded by a liberal education and a thorough knowledge of the world. Belinda &s;aw him, and acknowledged the full value of the happine&s;s &s;he had voluntarily ca&s;t from her.</P>
<P>I warned her again&s;t making compari&s;ons to the di&s;paragement of her hu&s;band; and hinted the folly and danger of &s;uffering any other per|&s;on to &s;tand higher in her e&s;teem. She acknow|ledged the truth of my remarks, &s;aid &s;he would en|deavour to be patient and content, but &s;he greatly feared &s;he had lo&s;t &s;ight of happine&s;s for ever. And &s;o indeed it proved, for though at the death of her father &s;he received a very hand&s;ome legacy, &s;o great was Horton's extravagance, that it was pre&s;ently gone, lavi&s;hed away on the wor&s;t of wo|men for the mo&s;t infamous purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Belinda had children very fa&s;t, and before &s;he was thirty years old was left a widow with eight helple&s;s children, to &s;truggle with the accumulated evils of poverty, contempt, and a broken heart&mdash;Horton's extravagance having obliged her to &s;ell her annuity, &s;he had no re&s;ource but to accept a

&s;mall yearly allowance from Lord Gaymore, who was then married, and allowed her a hundred pounds a year, for the education of her elde&s;t boy, to whom he was god-father.</P>
<P>I will leave you my dear girls to imagine the pain and mortification of &s;uch a dependence, and while you pity Belinda's mi&s;fortune, cautiou&s;ly avoid her errors! I &s;hall renew the &s;ubject next po&s;t, till when and ever believe the your friend,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER. IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS my &s;ubject is love, my dear children may perhaps once think an old woman enter|taining; but when they find my intention is only to expo&s;e the dangers which are attendant on that pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of following the example of more juvenile &s;cribblers, by expatiating on its plea|&s;ures, you will throw down my letter in a pet. But I &s;hall not let this deter me from following my intended plan, and endeavouring to convince you that there cannot be a more critical period in the whole cour&s;e of your lives, than that in which you are &s;urrounded by lovers; nor can there be any thing of more dangerous tendency than a young woman &s;uffering a lover to approach her
<PB N="49" REF="027654_0049_0FD567C48E164ED8">
in a clande&s;tine manner, or encourage addre&s;&s;es which &s;he has any rea&s;on to think her parents or friends would di&s;approve; &s;uch a conduct is gene|rally attended with di&s;agreeable con&s;equences.</P>
<P>I have a collection of letters in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which I think might well be termed a &s;chool for lovers, and will, I am certain, be of more ef|fect in convincing you of the impropriety of clan|de&s;tine marriages, than a whole &s;heet of dull precepts. I have &s;ent them for your peru&s;al, and by way of preface, &s;hall give you an account of the means by which I became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them.</P>
<P>A favourite &s;ervant of your grand-mother a who had been my nur&s;e, had married a reputable trade&s;man, but, through unavoidable mi&s;fortunes, they were reduced, and the hu&s;band thrown into pri&s;on. Martha lived in an ob&s;cure lodging, and had been for &s;ome months extremely ill. My lady encouraged me in going to &s;ee her, and car|rying her little pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>One day my lady was gone out to dinner, the &s;ervants were all in the kitchen, and I took that opportunity of going out unob&s;erved to vi&s;it Mar|tha. Charmed with the idea of going by my&s;elf (for I u&s;ually had a &s;ervant with me) I tripped nimbly along, in my way laying out my whole &s;tock of pocket money, which amounted to five
<PB N="50" REF="027654_0050_0FD567F84E0BE6C8">
&s;hillings, in tea, &s;ugar and bi&s;cuits, for my nur&s;e. As I went up &s;tairs to Martha's apartment, I ob|&s;erved in a &s;mall back room, the door of which was taken off the hinges, a tall well-made man, in an old ru&s;ty black coat, his face pale and meagre, his arms folded upon his bo&s;om, his eyes fixed &s;eemingly on the floor, but in&s;tead of the vacant inanimate &s;tare, there was a mixture of hor|nor and de&s;pair depicted in them. Curio&s;ity prompted me to draw near the door of the room; at the farther and, on a bundle of &s;traw, the only furniture the wretched apartment afforded, &s;at a woman, who&s;e features told &s;he had once been lovely; on her lap lay an infant a&s;leep, be&s;ide her &s;at a fine boy, who, with a piteous accent was a&s;king for bread; the woman paid no attention to his entreaties, but with her eyes fixed on the younge&s;t child, appeared like mi&s;ery per&s;onified. Young as I was, I felt my heart greatly afflicted at this &s;cene, and running ha&s;tily up &s;tairs into Martha's room, unable to articulate a word, I bur&s;t into tears. Martha a&s;toni&s;hed at the agony I was in, tenderly inquired the cau&s;e. I told her what I had &s;een. "Alas! my dear child," &s;aid &s;he, "tho&s;e people are in more di&s;tre&s;s than it is po&s;&s;ible for you to conceive; they have lodged in this hou&s;e about &s;ix weeks, in which time I am certain they have had nothing to &s;upport them|&s;elves and children but what they could rai&s;e from the &s;ale of a few cloaths; they are now a fortnight

in arrears for rent, and the inhuman landlord has taken the door off the hinges, and the windows out of the frames, to oblige them to quit the apart|ment. Alas, poor &s;ouls, they have no means of procuring another &s;helter from nocturnal dews, when they relingui&s;h this. I have not &s;een him &s;tir out the&s;e two days pa&s;t, and am apt to think in that time they have had no food except a &s;lice of bread and meat which I gave the elde&s;t child ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>How at that moment did I regret my money be|ing all &s;pent, five &s;hillings appeared to me a for|tune, which might pre&s;erve the&s;e unfortunate peo|ple; however, I had not even a &s;ingle halfpenny, nor could I bear the thought of taking from Mar|tha any part of what I had given her. I there|fore ha&s;tily bade her good bye, and flew rather than walked home, inquired for the hou&s;e-keeper, related the afflicting &s;ituation of the family, and reque&s;ted the loan of half a guinea. The hou&s;e|keeper was an unfeeling, mercenary woman, &s;he never heard a tale of di&s;tre&s;s but &s;he imagined it fictitious, nor would &s;he ever be&s;tow any relief, le&s;t the object relieved &s;hould be an impo&s;tor. She refu&s;ed my reque&s;t. I then had recour&s;e to the nur&s;ery maid, but could borrow no more than one &s;hilling.</P>
<P>With this trifle I eagerly returned to the poor

&s;ufferers, entered the apartment, and under pre|tence of ki&s;&s;ing the infant, dropped the &s;hilling into the mother's lap. The exclamation which broke from her, when &s;he &s;aw the money, con|vinced me &s;he was a foreigner; and the demeanour of the man was va&s;tly above the common rank of people.</P>
<P>Unfortunately my Lady did not return from her vi&s;it till after &s;upper, &s;o that I was not permit|ted to &s;et up to &s;ee her; but though I retired to bed I could not &s;leep, my mind had been too much agitated, and the &s;tarving family had left &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on it, that the moment I clo&s;ed my eyes they were pre&s;ent to my imagination. Early in the morning I &s;tole to Lady Winworth's chamber, told my little &s;tory, and on my knees intreated &s;ome money to carry to them.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip, though from infancy nur&s;ed in the lap of ea&s;e and affluence, had an heart over|flowing with compa&s;&s;ion towards her &s;uffering fel|low-creatures; &s;he gave me two guineas, and or|dered the footman immediately to attend me.</P>
<P>I cannot de&s;cribe the joy that expanded my heart as I proceeded to G&mdash; Street. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was ju&s;t ri&s;en, and was open|ing his &s;hop. I a&s;ked for the foreign gentleman. <HI>Gentleman,</HI> returned he with a &s;neer, the French

<P>It was yet early, the morning was inviting, and I thought a walk in the fields might cheer me after my recent di&s;appointment; however, I previou&s;ly determined every inquiry &s;hould be made after the poor foreigner and his family.</P>
<P>Cro&s;&s;ing a field in the vicinity of Mary-le|bon, the voice of a child crying caught my ear, I turned my head, and &s;aw at a little di&s;tance, &s;eated on a log of wood, the very per&s;on I had been &s;eeking, one child was in his arms, the other &s;tood by him, his wife lay on the ground. I ran to him, &s;poke to him, bade him take hope, and put the two guineas in his hand&mdash;he looked at the money, then at me. Angel of mercy, &s;aid he, with a deep &s;igh, it is too late, my Agnes has left me. I &s;aw his intellects were di&s;ordered and &s;huddered with horror.

Her eyes were partly clo&s;ed, her mouth half open, her lips black&mdash;Death had that night re|lea&s;ed her from a world of mi&s;ery. I &s;hrieked and fainted. When I recovered I found my&s;elf in my dear Lady's arms, who told me, the body of the poor young woman was taken care of, that the man was quite di&s;tracted and entirely un|able to give any account of him&s;elf, though from an unfini&s;hed letter, addre&s;&s;ed to the Marchione&s;s Savillion, which was found in the woman's pocket they had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e they were of a good family.</P>

<P>About &s;ix months after I was &s;ent to a convent near Paris, in order to fini&s;h my education, and perfect my&s;elf in the French language. Among a number of boarders who re&s;ided at the convent, I was particularly noticed by one, who was di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the title of St. Augu&s;tina; &s;he was of a weakly con&s;titution, and often confined to her bed, when &s;he was always plea&s;ed if I would work or read be&s;ide her. One day &s;he gave me her keys, and de&s;ired me to unlock a cabinet and take out a curious piece of needle|work which &s;he &s;aid had been executed by a once

loved friend. As I took the work from the drawer, a miniature picture attracted my notice; methought I knew the features; I took it up to examine it more minutely, and immediately re|collected the intere&s;ting countenance of the un|fortunate Agnes. Upon inquiry I found I was right in my conjecture; St. Augu&s;tina was the Marchione&s;s Savillion, whom Lady Winworth had made numerous fruitle&s;s inquiries after. She had been the friend and companion of Agnes, but had married and left the convent where they both boarded ju&s;t before that young lady, and her la&s;t pathetic letters never reached her till it was too late to admini&s;ter relief; the Marchio|ne&s;s had &s;ince lo&s;t her hu&s;band and two fine children, by fire, which accident had &s;o impaired her health and depre&s;&s;ed her &s;pirits, that &s;he had retired from the world, and meant to &s;pend the remainder of her days in the convent where &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed her youth. She &s;hewed me all Ag|nes's letters, and before I left France &s;uffered me to take copies of them.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. AGNES TO THE MARCHIONESS.</HEAD>
<P>WHY have you left me, my Augu&s;tina, why are you away at the moment I mo&s;t want your advice?&mdash;Selfi&s;h Agnes, methinks I hear

<P>You ever knew the aver&s;ion and horror that &s;eized my heart when I reflected on the intended union between my&s;elf and the Count de la Rue. Alas! my Augu&s;tina, the time approaches when that aver&s;ion will become a crime, and yet I feel it every day increa&s;e. Shall I own to the &s;ympathizing bo&s;om of friend&s;hip, that my heart has made its election, and that election has not fallen on the man for whom my parents have de|&s;igned me. I know you will blame me, I know you will bid me endeavour to conquer my grow|ing pa&s;&s;ion, and call in rea&s;on to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Alas! what power has rea&s;on over the heart torn by contending pa&s;&s;ions? Duty bids me &s;tifle my &s;ighs, and bend my thoughts and wi&s;hes to|wards the Count, love triumphs over duty, and I can only think of Vieurville.</P>
<P>The day after you left our convent, Madamoi|&s;elle Vieurville reque&s;ted me to attend her to the parlour, where her brother and lover waited to &s;ee her. "You mu&s;t go, Agnes, &s;aid &s;he, or my brother will be quite at a lo&s;s how to amu&s;e

him&s;elf, while I conver&s;e with Montro&s;e." I was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, and on entering the parlour, was &s;truck with the noble mein and elegant man|ner of young Vieurville; we chatted for &s;ome time on indifferent &s;ubjects, his vivacity and wit, (through which it was ea&s;y to di&s;cover a fund of good &s;en&s;e) delighted me, and when I retired with Mademoi&s;elle, I could not help expre&s;&s;ing my ad|miration; he is a charming young man indeed, &s;aid &s;he, and had I not known that you were on the point of marriage, I &s;hould not have ventured to introduce him to you, for fear you might lo&s;e your heart; for you mu&s;t know (continued &s;he, paying no regard to the vi&s;ible emotion which I am certain agitated my features) that Louis is to be married the &s;ame day that I am, to a beautiful Spani&s;h lady, who is expected in Paris next month. Has he ever &s;een his intended bride? &s;aid I, affecting indifference. Oh! no, &s;he re|plied, but if Donna Clara be but half as lovely as her picture repre&s;ents her, he mu&s;t inevitably fall in love. It is odd, &s;aid I, that he &s;hould con&s;ent to marry a woman he has never &s;een. I dare &s;ay it appears &s;o to you, replied Mademoi&s;elle, but when I &s;hall tell you how it came about, your wonder will cea&s;e.</P>
<P>My mother was the only daughter of an ancient wealthy Spani&s;h family, and eloped with my fa|ther
<PB N="58" REF="027654_0058_0FD5680B2F4B3D20">
from a convent, where &s;he was placed for education. The match was very unequal; her father was irreconcilably offended, and would never &s;uffer her to be named in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>My mother was tenderly beloved by her bro|ther, who, at the old nobleman's decea&s;e, paid her a hand&s;ome fortune, and vowed their families &s;hould ever live in the &s;tricte&s;t amity.</P>
<P>My uncle was married to a woman of whom he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond, and when, in giving birth to Donna Clara, &s;he departed this world, he took a &s;olemn oath that no other woman &s;hould ever &s;upply her place, but that the whole of his future life &s;hould be devoted to the care of his daughter. My mother at that time lying in of a &s;on, the two infants were contracted to each other, and my brother, at his uncle's decea&s;e, is to inherit the e&s;tate and titles devolving to him from his grand|father. My uncle is expected to bring his daugh|ter to Paris this winter, when the marriage is to be completed, and I &s;hall be delivered from this horrid convent.</P>
<P>I cannot de&s;cribe my feelings during Mademoi|&s;elle's recital. I know not what could be the cau&s;e of my agitation, but I could hardly re&s;train my tears, while I remained in her apartment. When I retired, I began to take my heart to ta&s;k,
<PB N="59" REF="027654_0059_0FD5680CE1B14650">
and determined to repel a ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion, which had thus &s;uddenly taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it: I fore|bore making any compari&s;on between my intend|ed Lord and young Vieurville, and determined never to &s;ee the latter again; but the next morn|ing vanqui&s;hed the&s;e good re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>I was but ju&s;t ari&s;en, when one of the lay-&s;i&s;ters informed me a gentleman reque&s;ted a few mo|ments conver&s;ation. Imagining it to be either the Count, or &s;ome me&s;&s;enger from my father, I repaired without he&s;itation to the parlour. Judge of my &s;urpri&s;e when I found my&s;elf in the pre&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur Vieurville. Suppo&s;ing the nun had made a mi&s;take in calling m&eacute; in&s;tead of Made|moi&s;elle, his &s;i&s;ter, I was going to retire, when he intreated me to &s;top, a&s;&s;ured me there was no mi&s;take, and taking my hand, led me to a chair, and &s;eated him&s;elf be&s;ide me.</P>
<P>I come, deare&s;t Madam, &s;aid he, to entreat a few moments &s;erious attention from you, and a candid an&s;wer to a que&s;tion, which though abrupt in its nature, yet from the circum&s;tances which we both at pre&s;ent are in, demands an ex|plicit reply. My &s;i&s;ter has informed me, that your parents de&s;ign you for the wife of Count de la Rue; however pre&s;umptuous the &s;uppo&s;ition may be, I cannot imagine your heart has any in|tere&s;t in the intended union. My heart, Sir,
<PB N="60" REF="027654_0060_0FD5680E0D1D6430">
replied I, will ever follow the dictates of duty, and rejoice in ratifying any engagement which I am certain will give my parents &s;o much plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>But was that heart left to make its free choice, would it then have &s;elected the Count as the ob|ject of its deare&s;t affection?</P>
<P>I know not, Mon&s;ieur, what authority you have to make the&s;e enquiries, nor do I think my&s;elf obliged to an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>I ro&s;e to quit the parlour&mdash;lovely Agnes, &s;aid he, catching my hand, I know I have been a|brupt, but let my &s;ituation plead my excu&s;e. You no doubt have heard from my &s;i&s;ter, that I am de&s;igned the hu&s;band of a woman I have never &s;een; till ye&s;terday I ever believed my heart un|&s;u&s;ceptible of the power of beauty, and imagined I might be as happy with Donna Clara as any other woman, but I am now convinced, that indif|ference only proceeded from the want of a proper object to call forth the affections of my heart. I have &s;een the lovely object who has that power, I feel my bo&s;om glow with new and unutterable &s;en|&s;ations, and though I would have married Clara had I continued in a &s;tate of indifference; I will never wed her now, my heart is firmly attached to another. You, adorable Agnes, are the only
<PB N="61" REF="027654_0061_0FD5681202655B88">
woman who ever gave my heart a &s;ingle pain, or taught it to throb with rapture; if your affections are already engaged, I will condemn my&s;elf to eternal &s;ilence, but if you will grant me one ray of hope that you are not altogether indifferent to my &s;uit, the world &s;hall not tempt me to enter into any engagement with Donna Clara.</P>
<P>Oh! my beloved Augu&s;tina, at that moment rea&s;on, honour, fortitude, for&s;ook me, enchanted with the convincing proof he offered to give me of inviolable attachment, I &s;uffered him to per|ceive my partiality. I thought not on the irrepar|able injury I &s;hould do Vieurville's family, I for|got the duty I owed my parents, the re&s;pect I owed my&s;elf, and confe&s;&s;ed that he alone was the ma&s;ter of my affections.</P>
<P>I &s;ee your anger, my dear friend, I hear you blame my imprudence; &s;hall I lo&s;e your friend|&s;hip, Augu&s;tina, will you cha&s;e the imprudent Agnes from your bo&s;om! Alas! If you do, where will &s;he find another re&s;ting place? The thought overpowers me, I can write no more.</P>

<PB N="66" REF="027654_0066_0FD5681DE68FDF38">
oh give it way, renounce not thy unhappy friend, but chear her with one forgiving line.</P>
<P>I have &s;een Vieurville, I have forfeited my vows, left the convent, and become a fugitive and an exile, my brain is di&s;tracted when I think what I have &s;uffered this la&s;t fourteen days, nor can all my hu&s;band's tenderne&s;s &s;oothe me. My pul&s;e throbs, my veins are &s;corched with heat&mdash;I mu&s;t throw a&s;ide my pen, my eyes are dim. Augu&s;tina, thy dying friend lifts up her &s;oul in prayers for thy happine&s;s.</P>
<P>After three weeks being confined to my bed, I am at length permitted to addre&s;s the com|pa&s;&s;ionate friend of my youth. Rai&s;ed from the confines of the grave, I once more pour forth my &s;oul into the bo&s;om of Augu&s;tina. I will now at|tempt to give you &s;ome regular account of the proceedings of la&s;t month. Alas! my friend, my heart will bleed afre&s;h as I trace the painful &s;cenes, painful they will ever be to my remem|brance, for I have drawn inevitable ruin on the man my &s;oul doated on.</P>
<P>As I had never heard any tidings of Vieur|ville, from the time I was taken from the convent, with a de&s;ign of being married to the Count, till within three days of the time when my novitiate was expired, I began to look on my profe&s;&s;ion as
<PB N="67" REF="027654_0067_0FD5681F66F534A0">
inevitable, and endeavoured to bring my&s;elf to think of it with calmne&s;s, but &s;till corroding thoughts would &s;ometimes intrude, and overturn my be&s;t re&s;olutions. My only wi&s;h was to hear whether Vieurville was alive or dead, or whe|ther he was married to my rival; but the&s;e were particulars I was never able to di&s;cover, as his father and family had quitted Paris &s;oon after my return to the convent.</P>
<P>There remained but three days now before I was to take the veil, and I endeavoured to fortify my mind again&s;t the awful day, with every argu|ment rea&s;on or religion could &s;upply. I was bu&s;y in reflecting on the change a few &s;hort hours would make, when one of our boarders a&s;ked me to accompany her to the grate; I complied, and we amu&s;ed our&s;elves &s;ometime in chatting to two Engli&s;h ladies, who were in the parlour; the ladies were ju&s;t preparing to leave the convent, when a violent ringing at the gate alarmed us; the portre&s;s ran to open it, and in a moment Vieurville ru&s;hed into the parlour. I know not what I &s;aid or whether I &s;poke at all&mdash;a &s;udden mi&s;t ob&s;cured my &s;ight and I fell to the ground; when I recovered, my friend, the boarder, told me, that &s;eeing the impetuo&s;ity of my lover, &s;he had advi&s;ed him to leave the convent, and if he had any thing particular to communicate, to do it by letter, and inclo&s;e it to her. Her friendly
<PB N="68" REF="027654_0068_0FD568210F030868">
&s;oothing greatly contributed to calm my &s;pirits, and as none of the &s;i&s;terhood had &s;een Vieurville, they all remained ignorant of the interview.</P>
<P>In about three hours I received a letter, in which he told me, nothing but ab&s;olute force &s;hould &s;o long have kept him from me; that he had been detained in Spain by various &s;tratagems, but having at la&s;t eluded the vigilance of his guards, he hurried to Paris, where he pre&s;ently learnt the &s;acrifice I was about to make, he urged my leaving the convent and being united to him by the mo&s;t indi&s;&s;oluble bonds; and &s;aid, he made no doubt but my father would be ea&s;ily led to forgive us. I &s;hewed the letter to my young friend, &s;he joined the per&s;ua&s;ions of Vieur|ville, and &s;aid &s;he would undertake to manage my e&s;cape on the very morning on which I was to become profe&s;t.</P>
<P>I wrote to my dear Vieurville, and my friend enclo&s;ed it in one from her&s;elf, directing him in what manner to proceed. That very evening Edella, (which was the name of my friend) was &s;eized with a violent indi&s;po&s;ition, which would have made a dupe of even me, had I not been in the &s;ecret. She continued ill all night, and the next day when &s;he de&s;ired the abbe&s;s to &s;end to a relation &s;he had about &s;even miles from Paris, re|que&s;ting &s;he would &s;end her coach for her the
<PB N="69" REF="027654_0069_0FD56823AB67A220">
en&s;uing morning at eleven o'clock, as &s;he thought a few days &s;pent in the country, would be of in|finite &s;ervice to her. Vieurville was ordered to &s;end a carriage at nine, and it being the la&s;t morn|ing of my novitiate, I de&s;ired not be di&s;turbed till it was time for me to enter the chapel. This re|que&s;t I knew would be complied with, as it would be &s;uppo&s;ed, I wi&s;hed for time for meditati|on. Accordingly I early left my cell, and go|ing to Edella's apartment, dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in &s;ome of her cloaths, and put on a long black hood which would pull over the face; thus attired, I waited anxiou&s;ly for a ring at the gate and gue&s;&s;ing it was the coach, hurried down &s;tairs, and &s;o prevented the portre&s;s from coming up to call Edella. I met &s;everal of the nuns as I pa&s;&s;ed from her apartment to the door, but they neither &s;poke to me, nor attempted to &s;top me. I got out of the convent un&s;u&s;pected, and in le&s;s than an hour was in a place of &s;afety, where a prie&s;t immedi|ately united me to my dear Vieurville. My fir&s;t de&s;ire was that we &s;hould fly to my father for his protection, intreat his pardon and ble&s;&s;ing, and through his interce&s;&s;ion be again received into the church, from whence I was certain we &s;hould be excommunicated. It was midnight when I arriv|ed at my father's, he had been returned from Pa|ris near four hours, whither he had rapaired to &s;ee me take the veil, and was then, overcome with fatigue and di&s;appointment, ju&s;t retired to

re&s;t. I would not permit the &s;ervant to inform his ma&s;ter that I was come home, but following him up &s;tairs, threw my&s;elf on my knees by his bed-&s;ide. He &s;tarted at &s;eeing me, fury fla&s;hed from his eyes, and gra&s;ping my hand with vio|lence, he cried, Agnes, ungrateful girl, why are you here? With tremulous accents, I in a few words told him I was married, and intreated his pardon and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Oh! never &s;hall I forget his an&s;wer, twas aw|ful, 'twas more than nature could &s;upport. He &s;purned me from him, he cur&s;ed me, and impre|cated the wrath of heaven on his head if ever he forgave me. "I will not, &s;aid he, precipitate your impending fate, by betraying you to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers; go ha&s;ten to leave France, and if you can be happy oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of a father's cur&s;e, may you be &s;o!&mdash;Hence, begone, you offend my &s;ight."</P>
<P>Vieurville forced me out of the room.

Vieurville is di&s;inherited, di&s;owned, and loaded with a fa|ther's anger; but will you believe it, my friend, he &s;till loves the woman who has brought tho&s;e mi&s;fortunes upon him; but that love, that warm mutual affection that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between us &s;erves only to heighten our mi&s;ery&mdash;for oh! what tor|ture can compare to that of &s;eeing the object we love overwhelmed with di&s;tre&s;s we have not the power to mitigate?&mdash;</P>

<P>THE &s;un was &s;unk beneath the we&s;tern hills, his parting beams made the horizon flame with burni&s;hed gold, and darted on the topmo&s;t branches of the lofty trees of a neighbouring &s;o|re&s;t. Autumn had not put off her plea&s;ing robe, nor had the gentle zephyr for&s;ook the plain to give place to his rude brother Boreas. The ground was &s;trewed with leaves of various hues, the ripened fruit hung on the bending trees, and fields of waving golden grain render|ed the &s;cene delightful.</P>
<P>Marian and Lydia having fini&s;hed their daily ta&s;k, &s;et a&s;ide their wheels with alacrity, and tying on their &s;traw bonnets, prepared to enjoy the beauties of the evening, by rambling over the adjacent fields and meadows.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="027654_0077_0FD568380D7CAEB8">
They were innocent and &s;prightly as the young fawn that lightly bounds over the verdant lawn; &s;miling youth and ro&s;y health glowed upon their cheeks, and &s;parkled in their eyes; their wi&s;hes untaught by art or luxury to &s;tray beyond the bounds which &s;imple nature has marked out, were ea&s;ily &s;upplied; they aro&s;e each morn with the feathered chori&s;ters, and chearfully pur&s;ued their daily labour; the even|ing was their time for mirth. Innocence pre|&s;ided over all their plea&s;ures, and meek-eyed content on downy pinions hovered over their homely couch, &s;weetening their quiet &s;lum|bers.</P>
<P>Their cottage was &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant val|ley, on the borders of Wales; it was plain and rural, it contained every nece&s;&s;ary, but no &s;uper|fluities; &s;implicity had decorated it, and the neatne&s;s of its furniture rendered it more plea&s;|ing to&punc; the ru&s;tic inhabitants than the mo&s;t &s;ump|tuous palace.</P>
<P>Here Marian and Lydia, by their chearfulne&s;s and indu&s;try, enlivened the declining hours of their mother Dorcas.</P>
<P>Beware, &s;aid the careful mother, beware, my children, tarry not too long, le&s;t the evening damps &s;hould impair your health, and rob your mother of her only comforts.</P>

The &s;i&s;ters departed, and as they wandered over the fields, in the innocent gaiety of their hearts, carroled forth their &s;ongs in wild, untu|tored, but melodious notes.</P>
<P>Sir George Lovemore had arrived a few days before at Gwinfred-Hall, to vi&s;it a maiden aunt, who&s;e unlimited fortune demanded this mark of re&s;pect, for the virtues of her mind, or the &s;weetne&s;s of her manner he was totally unac|quainted with. Mrs. Gwinfred's unaffected pie|ty, good-humour, and amiable di&s;po&s;ition, were things totally di&s;regarded by the young liber|tine, though the vi&s;it was profe&s;&s;edly made to her, yet he &s;pent but a &s;mall &s;hare of his time in her company. He was continually rambling from one place to another, making vi&s;its to tho&s;e neighbouring gentlemen who&s;e opinions and manners mo&s;t &s;uited with his own. He was this evening returning from a vi&s;it to the Earl of Landaff, he was &s;eated in an elegant phaeton, drawn by four beautiful bays, his &s;er|vants were in their be&s;t travelling liveries, which were green faced with buff, and &s;uperbly trim|med with gold lace, they proceeded &s;lowly, the animals &s;eeming to partake of their ma&s;ter's in|dolence.</P>
<P>Marian and Lydia had wandered to the road, and were ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ing it with an intent to enter
<PB N="79" REF="027654_0079_0FD5683EFB91C568">
a &s;mall wood on the other &s;ide, when this mag|nificent equipage impeded their way. They had never before &s;een any thing half &s;o grand&mdash;they &s;topped involuntarily to admire it as it pa&s;&s;ed; the wind had blown off Marian's bon|net, her luxuriant brown hair falling in ring|lets over her face and neck, &s;erved as a &s;hade to heighten but not ob&s;cure her charms.</P>
<P>Sir George caught a glimp&s;e of her per&s;on, and in her little white jacket, &s;imple, unadorn|ed, &s;he appeared to him like a wood nymph; her form was delicate, her &s;tature rather below the middling &s;ize. He alighted from his phae|ton, and offering his hand to Marian, &s;aid he would a&s;&s;i&s;t her in cro&s;&s;ing the road; he &s;eized her unreluctant hand, he gazed earne&s;tly upon her face, and felt in a moment his heart was captivated by this ru&s;tic fa&s;cinating beauty; the mode&s;t inobtru&s;ive charms of Lydia were unno|ticed, he called her &s;i&s;ter by a thou&s;and divine appellations, which, as they had never heard them before, at once excited their wonder and their fears.</P>
<P>Leave us, good Sir, &s;aid Lydia, for we mu&s;t return home, and &s;hould our mother &s;ee you, &s;he would be angry with us; be&s;ides, Sir, we country maidens are not u&s;ed to conver&s;e with &s;uch grand folks, and mayhap you will laugh

at our &s;implicity. They then dropped their curt&s;ies, and wi&s;hing him a good night, would have left him, but he &s;topped Marian, and at|tempted rudely to &s;alute her; &s;he &s;hrieked, &s;truggled, and at length freeing her&s;elf from his hold, caught her &s;i&s;ter's hand, and darting acro&s;s the field, they were pre&s;ently out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Sir George gazed after them for a moment, then, a&s;cending his carriage, determined in his own mind to attempt the &s;eduction of Marian. He made no doubt but &s;he would again walk the &s;ame way, and re&s;olved every night to ram|ble out in hopes of meeting her.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters &s;lackened not their pace till they arrived within &s;ight of their mother's cottage. Dorcas, unea&s;y at their long &s;tay, had walked forth to meet them; their ha&s;te and confu&s;ion alarmed her. Tell me, my children, &s;aid &s;he, why are you thus agitated? Has any thing frightened you, or has any of the low-bred clowns in&s;ulted you? Why would you walk &s;o late?</P>
<P>Dear mother, cried Lydia, a gentleman &s;top|ped us, and was &s;o rude to my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Not very rude, &s;aid Marian, interrupting her, he only wanted to ki&s;s me, and I ran away from him. But you cannot think what a fine gen|tleman
<PB N="81" REF="027654_0081_0FD56841C996B258">
he was, &s;o hand&s;ome, and he had &s;uch a pretty thing to ride in; dear, dear, how I &s;hould like to ride in &s;uch an one.</P>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed, Marian, &s;aid Dorcas, grave|ly, to hear you talk thus; it becomes not a girl of your humble &s;tation to &s;peak in &s;uch rap|tures of the beauty of a gentleman, or the grandeur of his equipage, much le&s;s to form wi&s;hes to be indulged by riding in it.</P>
<P>Why &s;urely, dear mother, &s;aid &s;he, it is no harm to wi&s;h.</P>
<P>It is wrong, my dear child (replied the ten|der mother) very wrong to form wi&s;hes which we are certain, from the &s;ituation in which it has plea&s;ed Providence to place us, can never be laudably gratified. You know, Marian, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible you can ever po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;plendid equi|page.</P>
<P>Oh! dear, &s;aid Marian, I do not think &s;o; mayhap the fine gentleman may be in love with me; I am &s;ure he called me by many pretty names.</P>
<P>Dorcas &s;hook her head, and &s;ighed. And how, &s;aid &s;he, looking mournfully at Marian, how has vanity found entrance in a heart I had hoped was the &s;eat of innocence and content.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="027654_0082_0FD56845800E34B8">
Don't be angry with my &s;i&s;ter, dear mother, &s;aid Lydia, to be &s;ure the gentleman did talk a great deal about beauty and godde&s;&s;es, but I dare &s;ay he meant nothing.</P>
<P>That's nothing but envy, &s;aid Marian, peev|i&s;hly, becau&s;e he did not &s;ay any thing to you. For of what u&s;e would it be to him to &s;ay I was the lovelie&s;t girl he ever &s;aw, if he did not think &s;o; that would be fibbing for fibbing's &s;ake.</P>
<P>Dorcas &s;miled at her &s;implicity, while &s;he re|gretted that tho&s;e &s;parks of vanity which had ever lain dormant, had by flattery been blown into a flame. They entered the cottage, and &s;at down to a rural &s;upper of milk and fruit; during the repa&s;t Marian could think nor &s;peak of aught be&s;ide the gentleman.</P>
<P>Lydia was &s;ilent, and Dorcas now and then &s;ighed profoundly, while a tear fell as &s;he re|verted in her thoughts to occurrences long &s;ince pa&s;t; when they had fini&s;hed their temperate meal, &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed her daughters.</P>
<P>My dear children, &s;aid &s;he, you have often heard me &s;ay, that you lo&s;t your father when you were quite infants: in that I told you truth; he is lo&s;t, irreparably lo&s;t to you and me, but it was not death that tore him from us. I

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF DORCAS. PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS the only daughter of a farmer in the We&s;t of England. He in his youth, by in|tegrity and fidelity, &s;o well recommended him|&s;elf to the favour of the nobleman, of whom at that time he rented a farm, that he made him &s;teward of all his e&s;tates, which were &s;ituated in that country.</P>
<P>I had the mi&s;fortune to lo&s;e my mother before I had &s;een &s;ixteen years; &s;he was a woman of ex|emplary piety, &s;he had early inculcated in my mind a love of religion and virtue, and taught me that humility, charity, and chearful content were the true marks of Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;Had I never &s;uffered tho&s;e excellent precepts to depart from my mind, I &s;hould never have experienced the many mi&s;eries which have &s;ince marked my un|happy life.</P>
<P>During the life of this worthy parent I lived ex|tremely retired, &s;he &s;uperintended my education,
<PB N="85" REF="027654_0085_0FD5684BD1FD3980">
which was &s;uch as might render me a u&s;eful mem|ber of &s;ociety, but &s;he be&s;towed very little time on the &s;hewy accompli&s;hments which are &s;et &s;o high a price on in the pre&s;ent age, and which, though they are certainly nece&s;&s;ary to fini&s;h the education of a gentlewoman, are very immaterial to tho&s;e who expect to move but in the middle &s;phere.</P>
<P>After my mother's decea&s;e I took the entire charge of my father's family upon me, did the honours of his table, received and entertained all his vi&s;itants, and made frequent excur&s;ions abroad; I was thoughtle&s;s, vain, and giddy. I never be|fore heard the voice of adulation, which now a&s;&s;ailed my ears from almo&s;t every man with whom I conver&s;ed. I li&s;tened to it eagerly, and like my &s;imple Marian placed an implicit faith in all they &s;aid.</P>
<P>My heart was full of &s;en&s;ibility, and being deprived of my mother, whom I had ever con|&s;idered and loved as a friend, I began to look round for &s;ome female object on whom to &s;ettle tho&s;e affectionate feelings, to whom I might un|bo&s;om all my little inquietudes, con&s;ult and ad|vi&s;e with on trifling embara&s;&s;ments and vexations, which at that time I con&s;idered as &s;erious troubles.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="027654_0086_0FD5684EC357F118">
Unfortunately for me, the Earl of S&mdash;to whom my father was &s;teward, at that time came into the country, and brought with him his daugh|ter, Lady Laura S&mdash;and a young gentleman whom I &s;hall call Melfont, he was the &s;econd &s;on of a noble family, and though then only nineteen years old, had obtained the rank of captain in the army; his fortune was large, having inherited his mother's jointure, but he had cho&s;en the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of arms, as he thought the character of a good &s;oldier increa&s;ed the dignity of the gentle|man.</P>
<P>Lady Laura was nearly of my own age, chance one evening threw me in her way, as I was walk|ing with my father, and though fortune had placed &s;o great a di&s;tance between us, &s;he pro|fe&s;&s;ed a friend&s;hip for me, which highly gratified my vanity and delighted my father, as he thought it would contribute to my future advancement in life.&mdash;But alas! my children, it was the &s;ource from whence I might trace all my mi&s;fortunes.</P>
<P>Lady Laura was lovely in her per&s;on, and gentle in her manners, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;u&s;ceptible heart, and I thought her the pattern of all female perfection; but in this I was woefully deceived. She had that &s;elfi&s;h principle inherent in her na|ture, which made her prefer her own happine&s;s
<PB N="87" REF="027654_0087_0FD56850154A8408">
to that of the hole world be&s;ide; however, this was an error which I did not di&s;cover till &s;he had brought inevitable ruin on me, and unfeelingly triumphed in the mi&s;ery &s;he had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>From the evening of our fir&s;t interview &s;he con|tinually formed pretences to call at my father's, and at length, by the Earl's permi&s;&s;ion invited me to pa&s;s a few weeks with her at Seymour Ca&s;tle. My father joyfully con&s;ented to my ac|cepting the proffered honour, and the day being appointed, Lady Laura her&s;elf came in the cha|riot to fetch me.</P>
<P>It was near dinner time when I arrived, I felt my&s;elf rather aba&s;hed on being pre&s;ented to the Earl, and con&s;cious of my inferiority, my face glowed with confu&s;ion. Lord S&mdash;was a vene|rable and truly worthy nobleman; he &s;aid many obliging things to me, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure encouraged me, and I began to look and &s;peak with a tolerable degree of freedom, when being informed that dinner was &s;erved, the Earl led me into the dining room and pre&s;ented me to Cap|tain Melfont.</P>
<P>All my confu&s;ion now returned. I blu&s;hed, trembled, and hardly knew how I behaved dur|ing dinner, I had never before conver&s;ed with a man &s;o well-bred, polite, and agreeable as Cap|tain
<PB N="88" REF="027654_0088_0FD524407990D4E8">
Melfont. I wi&s;hed to appear engaging, and con&s;cious of my own in&s;ignificance, &s;hrunk as it were into nothing, and a thou&s;and times wi&s;hed my&s;elf at home again. All day I was unea&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfied with my&s;elf, every accompli&s;h|ment Lady Laura di&s;played, made me regret not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame, that I might equally with her contribute to the amu&s;ement and &s;hare the ap|plau&s;e of Melfont.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of a few days my con&s;traint gra|dually decrea&s;ed, the polite freedom with which I was treated by Lady Laura, and the pointed attentions I experienced from Melfont, contri|buted to rai&s;e me in my own e&s;teem, and I became chearful and happy.</P>
<P>As I had ever been accu&s;tomed to early ri&s;ing, I was in general up &s;ome hours &s;ooner than Lady Laura, and u&s;ually &s;pent the time till breakfa&s;t in the garden, &s;ometimes with a book, and &s;ome|times with my work. Melfont had frequently joined me in the&s;e little morning excur&s;ions, and I believe it was the plea&s;ure I experienced in his company, which made me &s;o often repeat them. At fir&s;t he was polite, uncon&s;trained and chearful, but he &s;oon grew thoughtful, pen&s;ive, and even ab&s;ent. I &s;aw the change with re|gret; I almo&s;t unknown to my&s;elf &s;hared his un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="89" REF="027654_0089_0FD56857CB327480">
and whenever he &s;ighed involuntarily, echoed his &s;ighs re&s;pon&s;ively.</P>

<P>I now di&s;covered the &s;tate of my own heart, I felt the greate&s;t &s;ati&s;faction in the knowledge of being beloved; but my affliction was great when I reflected he had &s;aid an in&s;urmountable barrier was placed between us. I was weak enough to &s;hed tears, and could hardly &s;ummon compo&s;ure enough to attend Lady Laura, at the u&s;ual hour of breakfa&s;t&mdash;though I was con&s;ci|ous that the indulging an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion would entail la&s;ting mi&s;ery upon me, I never once at|tempted to &s;ubdue it, or &s;tifle emotions which my own rea&s;on told me were improper and impru|dent in a young per&s;on in my humble &s;tation; though I am certain, had I when I fir&s;t di&s;cover|ed my growing partiality for Melfont, immedi|ately left Seymour Ca&s;tle, returned home, and by entering with avidity into all my u&s;ual avocati|ons, &s;trove to bani&s;h him from my mind, and cautiou&s;ly avoided all opportunities of &s;eeing or

conver&s;ing with him, I &s;hould &s;oon have conquer|ed the predeliction, and regained my u&s;ual tran|quility, but I wanted re&s;olution to fly the &s;ocie|ty of a man who&s;e pre&s;ence I fancied con&s;tituted my chief happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Solitude is the nur&s;e of youthful pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;in this I was fully indulged at Seymour Ca&s;tle, being allowed to pa&s;s my time in a manner mo&s;t &s;uitable to my own inclination, whil&s;t Lady Laura was engaged with her &s;everal ma&s;ters, who yet daily attended her. I had at the &s;ame time contracted a habit of reading for &s;everal hours in the day, and unfortunately in the late Coun|te&s;s's library met with &s;everal novels, a &s;ort of reading with which my dear girls are totally unacquainted; the&s;e books &s;erved only to &s;often my mind and encrea&s;e my pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o that by never attempting to repel it in its fir&s;t approach, it in time gained an entire a&s;cendency over my heart, formed a part of my exi&s;tence, twined round the chords of life, and can be extingui&s;h|ed only by the hand of death.</P>
<P>Here Dorcas pau&s;ed to give vent to her tears; Marian wept with her; Lydia threw her arms round her mother's neck, and ki&s;&s;ing off the drops as they fell upon her cheeks, vowed that no action of hers &s;hould ever increa&s;e the an|gui&s;h
<PB N="91" REF="027654_0091_0FD5685A8983B310">
which already weighed down her too &s;u&s;|ceptible heart. They then retired for the night, Lydia to the &s;oft repo&s;e that ever attends youth and innocence; Marian to reflect on the fine things Sir George had &s;aid, and Dorcas to weep over pa&s;t afflictions.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF DORCAS CONTINUED. PART II.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;un had ju&s;t darted his rays upon the di&s;tant mountains, the dew &s;till glittered on the waving gra&s;s, when Dorcas for&s;ook her re&s;tle&s;s couch, and &s;ummoned her daughters to their daily labour, having paid their adoration to the divine di&s;po&s;er of all things, and partook of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> breakfa&s;t, &s;he again continued her recital.</P>
<P>For &s;everal mornings after the explanation I mentioned, I repaired as u&s;ual to the garden, but Melfont did not join me, indeed he &s;eemed particularly &s;tudious to avoid every opportunity of conver&s;ing with me without a third per&s;on be|ing pre&s;ent. I was extremely unea&s;y at this con|duct, I imagined he &s;uppo&s;ed me too much his
<PB N="93" REF="027654_0093_0FD5685E979AE860">
inferior to be made the honorable partner of his fortune, and in my heart I thanked him for that honor, which prevented his &s;oliciting me on other terms; yet the vi&s;ible con&s;traint he put upon him|&s;elf in attempting to appear chearful, pained me exce&s;&s;ively; I became ab&s;ent, melancholy and dejected.</P>
<P>Lady Laura frequently interrogated me in her lively manner on the cau&s;e of my altered dipo&s;i|tion, and one morning when Melfont was in the room, &s;he jocularly &s;aid, "Why, my good cou|&s;in Charles, what in the name of wonder po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es you to be &s;o dull, one would think &s;ome enchant|ment prevailed at Seymour Ca&s;tle, and that the very air was infections, here is my lively Dory, metamorpho&s;ed into mu&s;ing melancholy; and you, my late giddy cou&s;in become the grave &s;en|timental philo&s;opher. I verily believe a certain blind deity has been bu&s;y with you, come hither, Charles, let me &s;ee where the arrow entered, is the wound deep?"</P>
<P>Melfont an&s;wered rather peevi&s;hy, and left the room. I felt my face glow and my heart throbbed violently, Lady Laura &s;aw my emotion, "Poor dear, &s;aid he, did it fall in love, and had it no hope; well, well, never mind it, 'twas all invo|luntary I'll be &s;worn."</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="027654_0094_0FD5685FDE90A948">
Oh! Lady Laura, &s;aid I, de&s;pi&s;e me not for my weakne&s;s.&mdash;I could &s;ay no more, tears bur&s;t from my eyes, and I hid my face with my hand|kerchief.</P>
<P>"My dear Dory, &s;aid &s;he, taking my hand, I did not mean to pain your gentle heart, I have long &s;een the tenderne&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between my cou&s;in and you, and a&s;&s;ure you it has given me peculiar plea&s;ure; but my &s;weet little friend, you mu&s;t be rather cautious to guard your &s;ecret, for &s;hould my father di&s;cover it, he will u&s;e every method to prevent an union between you ever tak|ing place, for Charles Melfont is de&s;igned by him the hu&s;band of your Laura."</P>
<P>Had I been tran&s;fixed by lightning, my coun|tenance could not have expre&s;&s;ed more horror and &s;urprize. I felt in a moment that I mu&s;t ap|pear a mon&s;ter of ingratitude in the eyes of the Earl, when he &s;hould find I had thus, though unintentionally counteracted his de&s;igns, in re|gard to his daughter's future &s;ettlement. I told Lady Laura, after what I had ju&s;t heard, I &s;hould think my&s;elf unpardonable to remain any longer at Seymour Ca&s;tle, or ever &s;uffer Melfont to en|tertain me again in the character of a lover. I reque&s;ted her to &s;uffer me to return home, and &s;aid, I would, if po&s;&s;ible, avoid ever &s;eeing him again.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="027654_0095_0FD56861B2E82A60">
She laughed at what &s;he called my delicate &s;cruples, and told me, &s;he had in her own mind planned out future &s;chemes of happine&s;s for us all; for to tell you the truth, &s;aid &s;he, I have no great inclination to Charles, being engaged both by inclination and &s;olemn promi&s;es, to a young man of no great fortune, though of a good family; he is at pre&s;ent only an en&s;ign in the guards, &s;o that I am certain my father will never con&s;ent to our union; but you know, my dear Dory, if you accept Melfont, I can then avow my choice openly, and you will at once render your&s;elf happy, and confer an obligation on your friend.</P>
<P>In this manner did the artful Laura work on my feelings, and at length won Melfont over to her party. We were frequently witne&s;&s;es to pri|vate interviews between her lover and her&s;elf, and in a &s;hort time &s;o far forgot what was due to our parents, and to our own intere&s;t and honor, that we not only planned her e&s;cape but accom|panied her flight, and the &s;ame ceremony united Lady Laura to Mr. Wal&s;h, and your mother to Melfont.</P>
<P>When we returned to Seymour Ca&s;tle we found it a &s;eat of tumult and confu&s;ion; the Earl refu&s;ed us admittance, and my father, irritated at my in|gratitude to his patron and benefactor, would not &s;uffer me to enter his habitation, nor did I from
<PB N="96" REF="027654_0096_0FD56862CC8AD890">
that unhappy day ever &s;ee him; my behaviour had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, that he fell into a deep melancholy, which &s;oon put a period to his exi&s;tence; the whole of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons were left to his neare&s;t male relation, and my name was only mentioned in the will, that he might reprobate my ingratitude.</P>
<P>I can truly &s;ay, the affliction I felt when in|formed of his decea&s;e, proceeded &s;olely from the reflection, that I de&s;erved his anger, and had not &s;een him or endeavoured to gain his pardon be|fore his death.</P>
<P>The angui&s;h of my heart was beyond expre&s;&s;i|on, but the unremitting tenderne&s;s which I ex|perienced from my hu&s;band &s;oon hu&s;hed my griefs to re&s;t, and I became tranquil, and even happy.&mdash;Alas! this &s;cene of &s;erene plea&s;ure was not long to la&s;t; it fleeted away like a vi&s;i|on, and like a pa&s;&s;ing &s;hadow left no trace behind.</P>
<P>One year of connubial love was pa&s;t, when you, my beloved girls, were in one day u&s;hered into the world. Melfont was di&s;appointed, he had hoped for a boy, as his family had never been reconciled to what they termed &s;o di&s;propor|tionate a match, he imagined &s;uch an event might in &s;ome mea&s;ure have conciliated their regard,
<PB N="97" REF="027654_0097_0FD56865D2CE1640">
but the birth of my daughters fru&s;trated the&s;e hopes; however he &s;till continued the kind at|tentive hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I lived extremely retired, con&s;oling my&s;elf for the lo&s;s of every plea&s;ure which a per&s;on of my age might wi&s;h to enjoy, in Melfont's affection; and while that continued I had no wi&s;h ungra|tified.</P>
<P>Lady Laura frequently vi&s;ited me; her father had never forgiven her precipitate marriage, nor did he ever give her any fortune.</P>
<P>Wal&s;h had married more from the hope of aggrandizing him&s;elf than from any affection he felt for her Lady&s;hip. When he found the&s;e hopes were illu&s;ive he threw off the ma&s;k, and treated her with contempt and unkindne&s;s, by which means he rendered her life extremely wretched.</P>
<P>She &s;aw the love and harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between your father and me, and from that &s;pi|rit of envy which hates to &s;ee happine&s;s in ano|ther family, which it cannot enjoy at home, &s;he determined to undermine my felicity, and ren|der me as completely wretched as her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="027654_0098_0FD568680AA451C8">
There is a caprice in the heart of man, or ra|ther a depravity in their natures, which leads them to neglect and de&s;pi&s;e a woman totally in their power, and pur&s;ue with avidity tho&s;e who by almo&s;t in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles, are placed at a di&s;tance from them. This was exactly the ca&s;e with Melfont. When Lady Laura was offered to him by her father, when wealth and honor would have attended his acceptance of her, he rejected her&mdash;but now, irrevocably united to me, and Laura the wife of another, he began to feel a pa&s;&s;ion for her, and to wi&s;h he had not marri|ed &s;o precipitately.</P>
<P>This pa&s;&s;ion was at fir&s;t admitted into his bo&s;om under the ma&s;k of pity, he would li&s;ten to the frequent complaints &s;he made of her hard fate, &s;oothe her di&s;tre&s;s, and offer every con&s;olation in his power.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time I joined him in endeavouring to alleviate the &s;orrows of the unhappy Laura; but at length his attentions to her became too pointed to e&s;cape the penetrating eye of watchful ten|derne&s;s, and I was unable to &s;tifle that jealou&s;y which I had long &s;trove to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>However afflicted I might be, at the vi&s;ible al|teration in your father's manner, I &s;uffered no complaint to break forth, but nur&s;ed my corrod|ing

&s;orrows in &s;ilence and &s;olitude; in his pre|&s;ence I endeavoured to appear chearful, though my heart was almo&s;t broken by his unkind|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Two years had pa&s;&s;ed in this dreadful manner, when Mr. Wal&s;h died, and Lady Laura be|came a blooming widow. Lord S&mdash;, her father, was at that time upon the continent, therefore &s;he had no opportunity to make an im|mediate per&s;onal application to him for reconci|liation.</P>
<P>Lady Laura had long treated me with a cool hauteur, &s;he now no longer wore even the &s;em|blance of politene&s;s, but whenever &s;he came to the hou&s;e, would either not &s;peak to me at all, or treat me with the mo&s;t cruel di&s;re&s;pect. I ventured to complain to Melfont of her ungene|rous behaviour, when his an&s;wer &s;truck me al|mo&s;t dumb with &s;orrow and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed, Madam, &s;aid he, that you &s;hould complain to me in this manner, what right have you to expect particular attention from a woman of Lady Laura's di&s;tinction, I think &s;he does you too much honor by conde&s;cending to enter the hou&s;e where you live. You &s;hould con|&s;ider, Dory, you are only my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>Yes, &s;urely; you know I was under age when the ceremony was performed. I have never in|troduced you to my family as my wife, nor have they ever con&s;idered you as &s;uch."</P>
<P>I heard no more, a cold damp came over me, I &s;huddered and fell lifele&s;s to the floor.&mdash;When I recovered, I found your cruel father had left me, in that &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, to the care of the &s;ervants. I gave free vent to my &s;orrows in a flood of tears, and then &s;ummoning all the for|titude I could to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, called for pen and ink, and wrote a letter to Melfont, a copy of which I have pre&s;erved.</P>

<P>SINCE you inform me I am not your wife, be a&s;&s;ured I retain too high a &s;en&s;e of honor to remain with you on any other terms; but do not flatter your&s;elf! mean tamely to give up a title which I think I have an undoubted right to, hav|ing received it at the altar, and borne it three years, during which time I have never di&s;graced it by thought, word, or action.

I know him to be a noble|man of too much honor and humanity to &s;uffer an in&s;ult offered to an unprotected woman to go un|revenged.

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your affectionate, but injured wife, DORCAS MELFONT.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>When I had fini&s;hed this letter I ordered a chai&s;e and four, and bidding the &s;ervant put up a few things, took you, my beloved girls, and de&s;iring the letter might be delivered to your father when he came home, which I knew would not be till late at night, &s;et off full &s;peed to Dover.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="027654_0102_0FD56870124B8090">
We travelled all night, and was lucky enough to arrive ju&s;t as a packet was &s;ailing for Calais, I immediately embarked, a few hours wafted us acro&s;s the channel, and I then travelled with as much &s;peed as po&s;&s;ible to Paris. It was late when I arrived, and being greatly fatigued with my journey, I determined to &s;tay till the next morn|ing before I waited on the Earl. I took an ha&s;ty &s;upper and retired, in hope to recruit my ex|hau&s;ted frame by &s;leep.</P>
<P>The next morning I aro&s;e early, and dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, took my dear children in my hand, and repaired to the Earl's. I was with difficulty ad|mitted, and when I entered the room where his Lord&s;hip was at breakfa&s;t, my agitation was &s;o great I could &s;carcely &s;tand.</P>
<P>Dorcas! &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, &s;tarting from his &s;eat.</P>
<P>Oh! my Lord, &s;aid I, (throwing my&s;elf at his feet, and pre&s;enting my girls to him) behold a mi&s;erable woman and two helple&s;s infants, who without your a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand mu&s;t be plunged in infamy and inevitable ruin.</P>
<P>Ri&s;e, Dorcas, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, explain your|&s;elf, your agitation at pre&s;ent deranges your ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="027654_0103_0FD56869B2F1F248">
I then in a few words told him, that Melfont had di&s;owned me for his wife, and that I was cer|tain he meant to marry Lady Laura.</P>
<P>Heaven forbid, &s;aid the Earl, that my poor in|fatuated girl &s;hould add &s;uch an heinous offence again&s;t humanity, to the catalogue of her former crimes. Oh! Dorcas, her undutiful behaviour has been like a viper preying upon my heart; and to increa&s;e my affliction, I have been told &s;he has di&s;honored even the man for whom &s;he for&s;ook her father's protection. But this will be an act to make honor and humanity blu&s;h. Be comforted, continued he, for the &s;ake of the&s;e poor inno|cents, I will not &s;uffer your wrongs to pa&s;s unno|ticed or unredre&s;&s;ed. Cheared by the&s;e kind ex|pre&s;&s;ions I returned to my lodgings, with a heart con&s;iderably lightened, and was de&s;ired to call on the Earl again in about ten days, when he &s;hould have had time to con&s;ult what was be&s;t to be done. On the appointed morning I repaired to the Earl, I found him &s;eated at a table writing, a letter lay unfolded before him.</P>
<P>Dorcas, &s;aid he, (ri&s;ing and leading me to a &s;eat) I have received letters from England &s;ince I &s;aw you.</P>
<P>Do they mention me, my Lord?</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="027654_0104_0FD5687427FA67D0">
Yes, they &s;ay you have long led a very di&s;&s;o|lute life, and that you have eloped from your hu&s;|band with a young officer, and taken with you a quantity of money and jewels.</P>
<P>Heaven forgive them, &s;aid I, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>But this is not all, my poor girl, continued the Earl, you have wor&s;e trials than this to encoun|ter.</P>
<P>Then I hope God will give me fortitude to &s;upport them, &s;aid I, but indeed my heart is al|mo&s;t broke already. However, my Lord, let me know the wor&s;t, and I will endeavour to bear it with patience.</P>
<P>Melfont is married to Lady Laura.</P>
<P>Cruel Melfont, how have I de&s;erved this inhu|man u&s;age.</P>
<P>After you left me the other day, &s;aid the Earl, I &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger expre&s;s to endeavour to procure a certificate of your marriage, and to take a letter to Laura, promi&s;ing pardon and forgetfulne&s;s of all that was pa&s;t if &s;he would not marry Melfont, but in ca&s;e &s;he cho&s;e to follow the bent of her own depraved inclination, to never a&s;&s;ure the title of
<PB N="105" REF="027654_0105_0FD568758A322738">
my daughter again, for from that moment I would di&s;own her. My me&s;&s;enger returned ye&s;terday, and informs me, it is impo&s;&s;ible to procure a cer|tificate, as the clergyman who married you was dead, and that the day after you left England, Melfont publicly e&s;pou&s;ed Lady Laura.</P>
<P>Merciful heaven, &s;aid I, (&s;inking on my knees) to your care I commit my dear injured children. Oh! &s;uffer them not to be puni&s;hed for the &s;ins of their parents; make me the object of thy wrath for my di&s;obedience and ingratitude, but Oh! of thy infinite mercy avert the &s;hafts of keen adver|&s;ity from the bo&s;om of my beloved girls.</P>
<P>The Earl was affected, he dropped a tear in compa&s;&s;ion to my angui&s;h, and promi&s;ed to be my protector. The next day he gave me a deed, in which he &s;ettled this cottage and its appendages, with one hundred pounds a year, on me during my life, and to be continued to my children as long as they by their conduct &s;hould merit his protection. I remained in France a few days, ju&s;t to recruit my &s;trength and &s;pirits, and then &s;et forward for this place, where I have lived now &s;eventeen years, endeavouring to form the minds of my children in &s;uch a manner, that the follies which occa&s;ioned their mother misfortunes might never find entrance in their hearts.</P>

<P>MARIAN li&s;tened attentively to the affect|ing recital of her mother's &s;orrow, but eve|ry &s;yllable &s;unk deep into the heart of Lydia. I will daily think of your di&s;tre&s;&s;es, my dear mo|ther, &s;aid &s;he, and they will &s;erve as a &s;hield to my heart, and render it invulnerable to the at|tacks of vanity or the illu&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>I know not, replied her mother, but if he is, he can never be any thing to you, he has renoun|ced us all.</P>

<P>Fooli&s;h Marian, &s;aid the anxious mother, why regret the lo&s;s of &s;uch a trifle: be virtuous, my child, you will then elevate the mo&s;t humiliating &s;tation, and ri&s;e &s;uperior to tho&s;e who&s;e only boa&s;t is wealth and titles, to render them the envy of the blind mi&s;guided multitude.

<P>The moon in maje&s;tic &s;plendor illumined the &s;ky, and darted her &s;ilver beams through the anci|ent elms that &s;haded Dorcas's cottage. The &s;i&s;ters were feated by the door, and in obedience to their mother's command, were pouring forth their thank&s;giving to the giver of all ble&s;&s;ing in an evening hymn. They had ju&s;t fini&s;hed when a ru&s;tling among the bu&s;hes made them &s;tart; a beautiful pointer ran into the cottage, and in a moment a &s;ervant in livery appeared, and enqui|red the way to Gwinfred-Hall. Dorcas directed him which way to go. He &s;aid he was weary, re|que&s;ted a drop of water, and leave to re&s;t. Lydia went to fetch him &s;ome cyder, Dorcas moved to|wards

the door, and &s;ilently admired the beauty of the &s;pangled firmament.</P>
<P>The man &s;eized the opportunity, and delivered to the lovely un&s;u&s;pecting Marian a letter from Sir George Lovemore.</P>
<P>Love and ambition had already taught her art, &s;he ha&s;tily took the offered letter, and hid it in her bo&s;om. Alas! &s;imple maid, you there fo&s;tered a &s;erpent, who&s;e &s;ubtle poi&s;on tainted your very heart. The &s;ervant having completed his errand retired, and Marian found means to peru&s;e her letter;&mdash;it abounded with profe&s;&s;ions of love, vows of everla&s;ting fidelity, and encomiums on her beauty. She read it with rapture, and though &s;o recently warned of the duplicity of men, be|lieved every &s;yllable it contained. In conclu&s;ion, he &s;olicited a private interview the next morning, in the field adjoining her mother's cottage. Marian pau&s;ed at this reque&s;t, he&s;itated&mdash;read the letter again and re&s;olved to comply.</P>
<P>During &s;upper &s;he was thoughtful and ab&s;ent, and when the u&s;ual hour of re&s;t arrived, &s;he re|tired with an anxious perturbed mind; &s;leep was a &s;tranger to her eyes, and &s;everal times &s;he almo&s;t re&s;olved to &s;hew the letter to Lydia, and re|que&s;t her to accompany her&mdash;But then Sir
<PB N="06" REF="027654_0112_0FD56883CFB2CC80">
George had de&s;ired her to come alone, he might be offended and &s;he might never &s;ee him again. Vanity al&s;o pleaded, he might marry her, rai&s;e her to an exalted &s;tation, and &s;hould his views be otherwi&s;e than honorable, &s;he certainly had re|&s;olution to with&s;tand his &s;olicitations.</P>
<P>In this manner did &s;he wear out the tedious night, at five o'clock &s;he &s;tole &s;oftly from the &s;ide of her innocent &s;leeping &s;i&s;ter, and with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible opened the door that led into the fields. Aurora had but faintly &s;treaked the ea&s;t|ern &s;kies with mingled gold and purple, when the ill-fated Marian met her lover.</P>
<P>He thanked her for her conde&s;cention, told her his whole happine&s;s depended on her, and urged her immediate flight with him to London.</P>
<P>Marian he&s;itated, her mother, her &s;i&s;ter, hung heavy at her heart.</P>
<P>Sir George was an adept in the art of &s;eduction, he talked of gaiety, &s;plendor and plea&s;ure, &s;wore &s;he was born to grace the fir&s;t &s;tation, declared it was a crime to bury &s;o much beauty and &s;weetne&s;s in a de&s;art.</P>
<P><PB N="07" REF="027654_0113_0FD5688581444B88">
Marian's rea&s;on was not convinced, but her vanity was awakened and her &s;en&s;es dazzled, what wonder then that her &s;cruples were over|come by Sir George's artful per&s;ua&s;ions. She left the man&s;ion of peace and innocence, and in a chai&s;e which he had prepared for the purpo&s;e, hurried as fa&s;t as four hor&s;es would carry her to the &s;eat of di&s;&s;ipation and folly.</P>
<P>Marian dropped a tear as &s;he took a la&s;t look at the cottage, but Sir George ki&s;&s;ed it off, and the reflection which had cau&s;ed it to &s;tart was in&s;tantly bani&s;hed from her mind.</P>
<P>Lydia on awakening mi&s;&s;ed her &s;i&s;ter, and ha&s;tily ri&s;ing, ran into her mother's apartment, vexed that Marian &s;hould have been the fir&s;t to bid her good morning. I am not u&s;ed to be &s;uch a &s;lug|gard, my dear mother, &s;aid &s;he, but my &s;i&s;ter has received your ble&s;&s;ing before me this morning. I have not &s;een your &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid Dorcas, but as it is a fine morning, &s;he has, no doubt, rambled out to enjoy its &s;weets; go, my beloved Lydia and &s;eek her.</P>
<P>Lydia left her mother, and &s;ought her &s;i&s;ter in the fields and woods; echo a thou&s;and times repeat|ed the name as &s;he called her dear Marian; at length fatigued and di&s;pirited, &s;he was returning
<PB N="08" REF="027654_0114_0FD5688816265960">
home, when &s;he met a &s;hepherd, who early attend|ed his &s;heep, that way, and demanded of him whether he had &s;een her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>He had &s;een her, he &s;aw her enter the chai&s;e with Sir George, he &s;aw them drive off.</P>
<P>Lydia heard the heart-rending tidings, &s;he would have wept, but tears refu&s;ed their relief; &s;he &s;ighed, rai&s;ed her hands to heaven in an ago|ny of grief, and &s;unk lifele&s;s upon the ground. The &s;hepherd was frightened, nor did he u&s;e any method to re&s;tore her, but ran backward and forward, looking wildly round him, and calling aloud for help. A young gentleman who had been that morning out a &s;hooting, heard the voice of terror, and ha&s;tened to the &s;pot where the hap|le&s;s Lydia lay. Her charms were not of the daz|zling &s;ort, but the more her features were examin|ed the more they intere&s;ted the beholder. The gentleman when he fir&s;t rai&s;ed her from the ground, felt only for her as he would for any other woman in di&s;tre&s;s; but when he looked attentively on her face, and beheld her lovely though inanimate fea|tures, he felt an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e to defend her not only from her pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s, but to &s;hield her for ever from pain and affliction. He carried her to a &s;pring, and bathed her temples with water, &s;he opened her expre&s;&s;ive blue eyes, Oh! my un|happy &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid &s;he, and freeing her&s;elf from the
<PB N="09" REF="027654_0115_0FD56889E70F7748">
arms of her deliverer, covered her face with her hands, and gave free vent to her tears.</P>
<P>Have you lo&s;t your &s;i&s;ter, my &s;weet maid, &s;aid the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Alas! Sir, replied Lydia, I fear my poor Marian is wor&s;e than dead. A gentleman has found means to en&s;nare her innocent un&s;u&s;pecting heart, and &s;he has this morning left her only friends to tru&s;t the promi&s;es of one &s;he never &s;aw till three days &s;ince. I know not how to return to my poor mo|ther with the&s;e fatal tidings, I fear it will go near to break an heart already oppre&s;&s;ed with woes al|mo&s;t too heavy to be borne. "But God temper|eth the wind to the &s;horn lamb," continued &s;he, rai&s;ing her eyes to heaven, and no doubt will in|&s;pire her with fortitude to bear, without repining, this heavie&s;t of his trials.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger reverenced her &s;orrow, he took her pa&s;&s;ive hand, drew it under his arm, and &s;o proceeded &s;ilently along towards Dorcas's cottage; he attempted not to interrupt her grief, but now and then a tear &s;tole down his manly cheeks, and a re&s;pon&s;ive &s;igh an&s;wered hers.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the cottage Dorcas met them at the door; Lydia flew towards her, fold|ed her arms round her neck, and dropping her
<PB N="10" REF="027654_0116_0FD5688B4ABEEE48">
head on her bo&s;om, &s;obbed aloud.</P>
<P>Oh! my beloved, &s;aid Dorcas, tell me, has any accident happened to your &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>She is gone, &s;aid Lydia.</P>
<P>What, forever? cried the fond mother eagerly.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear mother, &s;he is lo&s;t to us; that gen|tleman whom we met&mdash;</P>
<P>Enough, &s;aid Dorcas, I fully under&s;tand the extent of my mi&s;fortune; my Marian is di&s;ho|nored, plunged in infamy; but I will not renounce her, &s;he is my child. Oh! heavens, none but a parent can judge of the angui&s;h that now har|rows up my &s;oul. But, my &s;weet Lydia, will you for&s;ake your mother in her old age, will you leave her grey hairs to &s;ink in &s;orrow to the grave, without a friend to chear her la&s;t moments, with|out the gentle hand of filial love to clo&s;e her dying eyes.</P>
<P>Oh! no, cried Lydia, dropping on her knees, never, never; when I for&s;ake my honor'd mother, may heaven regardle&s;s hear me when I pray, may I be ca&s;t out to &s;ickne&s;s, pain and poverty, with|out a friend to pity or relieve me.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="027654_0117_0FD5688CF32287C8">
Dorcas embraced her, and the &s;tranger endea|voured to di&s;&s;ipate the drops of humanity which were gathering in her eyes. Lydia by degrees became more compo&s;ed, and informed her mother of the obligations &s;he was under to the gentleman who had accompanied her home.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, &s;aid Dorcas, you are my friend and benefactor, had I lo&s;t my Lydia I had lo&s;t my all; but &s;ay, by what name &s;hall I remember you in my prayers?</P>
<P>They call me Renfew, Earl of Landaff, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Dorcas &s;tarted and turned pale&mdash;the Earl continued,</P>
<P>Your &s;orrow has awakened in my brea&s;t every feeling of humanity, and if it is in my power to be of any &s;ervice to you, command me, and I will exert it to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>Alas! my dear Marian! &s;aid Dorcas.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you, replied the Earl, and wi&s;h I could re&s;tore her to you, but as that is not in my power, teach me by &s;ome other means to promote your happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027654_0118_0FD56891A81EE3A8">
My Lord, &s;aid Dorcas, there is but one way to give the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction to this afflicted heart; leave the cottage immediately, nor ever attempt again to &s;ee or conver&s;e with Lydia.</P>
<P>And why this cruel re&s;triction?</P>
<P>Time, my Lord, perhaps may inform you with my rea&s;ons for acting thus. At pre&s;ent I cannot alledge the true cau&s;e, and will never &s;toop to a mean equivocation to excu&s;e an action, which I am &s;en&s;ible is perfectly right.</P>
<P>The Earl was piqued, he bowed and left the cottage.</P>
<P>Lydia, &s;aid Dorcas, if you love your mother, you will avoid the Earl of Landaff.</P>
<P>He is generous and humane, &s;aid Lydia,</P>
<P>Tru&s;t not to appearances, replied her mother, when you &s;hall learn a tale which I could tell you, you will then, like me, tremble at the name of Renfew.</P>
<P>Peace, with the &s;peed of a courier, now fled from the man&s;ion of Dorcas, affliction u&s;urped her place, and with &s;olemn pace each night walk|ed with the &s;olitary Lydia over tho&s;e fields and
<PB N="13" REF="027654_0119_0FD5688ED19B4F18">
meadows where &s;he once had cheerfully tripped with her beloved Marian.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e melancholy excur&s;ions &s;he was acco&s;ted by the Earl of Landaff; &s;he would have fled, but he prevented her, and in the mo&s;t elo|quent language true love could in&s;pire, told her how dear &s;he was to him, and how cruel he thought her mother, in refu&s;ing him the plea&s;ure of her conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>My mother, replied Lydia, can be actuated by no motive but a wi&s;h to promote my happine&s;s. I e&s;teem you, my Lord, I &s;hall ever remember you with gratitude, but my mother has forbid me to hold any conver&s;ation with you. Adieu, Sir, I often think of you, but will never have any intercour&s;e with you.</P>
<P>Stay, my &s;weet Lydia, &s;aid the Earl, only &s;ay you do not hate me. I &s;wear, dear maid, my de|&s;igns are honorable, and if you will put your&s;elf under my protection, a private marriage &s;hall convince you how &s;incere my profe&s;&s;ions are.</P>
<P>My Lord, replied Lydia, though I acknow|ledge my&s;elf honored by this declaration, I mu&s;t decline accepting your offer; I know my rank in life is far beneath what would be expected in the bride of Landaff, but humble as I am, I will
<PB N="14" REF="027654_0120_0FD56894211062D0">
never become the wife of a man who would be a&s;hamed publicly to own me as &s;uch; nor will I ever clande&s;tinely conver&s;e with a per&s;on whom my mother has forbid me to &s;ee. My &s;i&s;ter, I fear, by her di&s;obedience, has rendered her&s;elf mi&s;erable, nor will I, by a like conduct, increa&s;e the affliction of my dear venerable parent.</P>
<P>Landaff expatiated on the many advantages attending wealth and &s;plendor; Lydia heard him with &s;ilent contempt. He told her his only wi&s;h was, to make her happy.</P>
<P>That is impo&s;&s;ible, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, the heart of Lydia never can know happine&s;s while her mo|ther is in affliction, and her &s;i&s;ter, perhaps, a mi&s;erable wanderer, expo&s;ed to all the wretch|edne&s;s, want and infamy can entail on a fallen woman.</P>
<P>All farther per&s;ua&s;ion was of no effect, Lydia continued firm in her re&s;olution of not leaving her mother, and fearful of again meeting the importunate Earl, avoided for &s;ome time her favorite walk, confined her&s;elf to the narrow limits of their garden, and devoted her time entirely to comfort and chear her afflicted parent.</P>
<P>The Earl finding no hope of &s;ucce&s;s in draw|ing Lydia from her duty, and having too much
<PB N="15" REF="027654_0121_0FD56895D5BEF888">
regard for virtue to force him&s;elf into their &s;oli|tude, with an intent to rob them of their only trea&s;ure, repaired to London, thinking time and ab&s;ence would effectually bani&s;h her from his memory.</P>
<P>We will now leave Lydia, following her u&s;ual innocent avocations, and return to Marian, who was emerged in the vortex of fa&s;hionable folly.</P>
<P>When Sir George per&s;uaded the un&s;u&s;pecting Marian to leave her home, and tru&s;t to his honor for protection, &s;he had no doubt but his de&s;ign was to marry her; he had never told her &s;o indeed, but &s;urely he could mean nothing le&s;s&mdash;he had declared he loved her, and did not men always marry the women they loved? Thus with fallacious hopes did &s;he quiet each ri&s;ing fear, and by painting to her&s;elf the plea&s;ure her mo|ther and &s;i&s;ter would experience when they &s;hould embrace her as Lady Lovemore, entirely oblite|rated the pain &s;he felt in reflecting on the unea|&s;ine&s;s they would &s;uffer when her flight &s;hould be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Sir George had never formed an idea of mak|ing her his wife, he &s;aw &s;he was beautiful, he felt he loved her, and thought by lavi&s;hing on her
<PB N="16" REF="027654_0122_0FD56897612E2018">
riches and finery, to which &s;he had hitherto been unaccu&s;tomed, to en&s;nare and lead her an ea&s;y victim to be &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of vice. To this end he forbore taking any liberty during their journey which might alarm her, treated her with re&s;pect and tender attention, and when they arri|ved in London placed her in an elegant lodging, with proper &s;ervants to wait on her, and left her to ruminate at lei&s;ure on the change in her &s;ituati|on.</P>
<P>The female attendant who was immediately a|bout the per&s;on of Marian, was a girl who had for|merly fallen a prey to the arts of Sir George, and now only enjoyed his bounty for reducing other haple&s;s females to the horrid level with her&s;elf. She was wretched in the lo&s;s of her own virtue, and like the &s;poiler of mankind, exulted in every opportunity of robbing others of that ble&s;&s;ing her|&s;elf could no longer enjoy. She treated the inno|cent Marian with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, led her through a &s;uit of &s;uperb apartments and told her, if &s;he could think of any thing that would add to the elegance or beauty of the furni|ture, &s;he need only mention her wi&s;hes to have them complied with. She next di&s;played a variety of elegant female apparel, toys, jewels, and other things proper to catch the attention of inexperi|enced youth, and kindle the glowing &s;eeds of vanity into a flame that might con&s;ume her.
<PB N="17" REF="027654_0123_0FD5689A24B42DE0">
She de&s;canted on the beauty, gallantry and gene|ro&s;ity of Sir George, nor left the poor bewildered girl, 'till &s;he had &s;een her in bed, and fa&s;t locked in the embraces of Morpheus.</P>
<P>Sophia, for that was the name of Marian's attendant, had learnt the part &s;he was to act from an old woman, to whom Sir George had wrote the day before he left Gwinfred-Hall. She knew it would not be prudent to give the artle&s;s girl any time for reflection, or to &s;uffer her thoughts to recur to the friends &s;he had left in Wales. She therefore entered her apartment at an earlier hour than is cu&s;tomary for town-bred ladies to ri&s;e; &s;he was &s;till a&s;leep.</P>
<P>Sophia watched the moment of awaking, and hurrying her to ri&s;e, prevented the intru&s;ion of bu&s;y or perplexing thoughts. She was attired in a fa&s;hionable undre&s;s, and before &s;he had time &s;ufficiently to admire either her&s;elf or the beauty of the breakfa&s;t apparatus, Sir George was an|nounced.</P>
<P>Marian was now hurried from one &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation to another for &s;everal days, &s;he was introduced to a large circle of tho&s;e unhappy women, who purcha&s;e ea&s;e and luxury at the price of honor.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="027654_0124_0FD5689B47BDCBD8">
She was charmed with the gaiety of their man|ners and the vivacity of their conver&s;ation. Their precepts, their example, corrupted her heart, and &s;he began to think a life of licentious love (fal&s;ly termed a life of liberty) was alone a life of happine&s;s&mdash;She forgot her afflicted mo|ther, forgot her innocent affectionate &s;i&s;ter, for|got every precept of virtue and religion, and fell a voluntary &s;acrifice to Sir George.</P>
<P>For many months folly wore the '&s;emblance of plea&s;ure, and riot and intemperance were mi&s;|taken for felicity. But alas! the wretched Marian too late awoke to a &s;en&s;e of her mi&s;erable &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>Sir George, attracted by a newer face, for&s;ook her; refu&s;ed her pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and even had the unfeeling villainy to betray her into the power of one of his libertine companions.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t her grief was violent, but &s;he had been taught a method to &s;tifle the emotions of her heart by drowning her rea&s;on in repeated draughts of &s;trong liquors. She was &s;oon lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, and from being once the admiration of the croud wherever &s;he moved, became an object of contempt, and &s;unk to the horrid &s;tate of common pro&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>MARIAN AND LYDIA. PART V.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a cold evening in autumn, the wind was bleak, the rain fell heavily, when pinched with famine and &s;hivering with the chilling bla&s;ts, Marian wandered, unfriended and unpitied, round Berkley-Square.&mdash;She had &s;everal times e&s;&s;ayed to &s;top the pa&s;&s;engers, and intreat charity, but there was yet a &s;park of pride remained un&s;ubdued, which made the &s;upplication appear too humilia|ting.</P>
<P>She drew near a door where a carriage was wait|ing&mdash;Major Renfew came from the hou&s;e, and entered it; by the light of a flambeau, which &s;hone on her face, he di&s;covered Marian&mdash;her features were yet lovely, though pale, and &s;trong|ly marked by the oppre&s;&s;ive finger of poverty. The Major bockoned her forward&mdash;Who are you &s;aid he, &s;urveying her with a &s;crutinizing eye, and why does your countenance wear this appear|ance of mi&s;ery?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="027654_0126_0FD5689F566CB518">
Alas! replied Marian, it is the true index of my heart! I am the daughter of folly and infamy, but though I own my puni&s;hment ju&s;t, I cannot bear it without complaining&mdash;I cannot &s;tarve in &s;ilence!</P>
<P>Various were the emotions that agitated the heart of Major Renfew while he gazed on the face of Marian; at fir&s;t he felt &s;omething like huma|nity &s;tirring in his bo&s;om, but at the &s;econd glance it was a more lively emotion, he gave her a guinea, and appointing her to meet him at ten o'clock, at a hou&s;e he mentioned, drove off to pay &s;ome vi&s;its of ceremony.</P>
<P>Marian felt a warm glow of gratitude play round her heart, &s;he could have knelt and ki&s;&s;ed the hand that had thus &s;ea&s;onably admini&s;tered relief. She waited impatiently for the hour of ten, when &s;he might thank her benefactor as &s;he ought.</P>
<P>Major Renfew was a man of gallantry, he had been &s;ome years &s;eparated from his wife, and indulged him&s;elf in frequent ca&s;ual intrigues, which did no great honor either to the brilliancy of his ta&s;te, or the goodne&s;s of his heart.</P>

at that time was without a favorite, and from the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion he felt in his bo&s;om towards our poor wanderer, he determined to rai&s;e her from the ab|ject &s;tate to which &s;he was reduced, to the <HI>honorable</HI> &s;tation of his mi&s;tre&s;s; he therefore di&s;patched his vi&s;its as quick as po&s;&s;ible, and repaired to the place of appointment.</P>

<P>Alas! Sir, &s;aid Marian mournfully, I had hoped you would have taken me from this life of &s;hame, indeed I am &s;ick of what is termed plea&s;ure, I long to &s;ink into peaceful ob&s;curity, and having ju&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;upply the wants of nature, re|pent my pa&s;t mi&s;deeds, and wait with patience the appointed hour of re&s;t.

<P>Nay, my dear girl, &s;aid the Major, this is affectation; come &s;hake off this gloom which your

<P>Oh! Sir, replied Marian, you have taught me that already, there is nothing which I &s;hould think too hard to perform, to convince you of the grateful affections of my heart. But I had hoped this &s;inking fragile frame never would have known pollution more.</P>
<P>The Major endeavoured to calm the perturbati|on of her &s;pirits, and pre&s;&s;ed her to partake of &s;ome excellent champaigne which he had ordered with the &s;upper. Marian was thoughtful, eat little, and frequently turned her head to hide the &s;tarting tears.</P>

The exclamation which &s;he made had thrown the Major into a &s;tupor of a&s;toni&s;hment, every faculty was &s;u&s;pended, nor could he recover &s;ufficient recollection to endeavour to &s;top her&mdash;a thou&s;and pa&s;t occurrences ru&s;hed upon his mind, and he remained immoveable, his eyes rivetted to the door through which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>At length recovering from his &s;urpri&s;e, he ob&s;er|ved a &s;mall &s;hagreen ca&s;e which lay on the floor, and during her &s;truggles had dropped from Mari|an's bo&s;om. He took it up, with emotion opened it, and the portrait of Dorcas met his eyes. The ca&s;e dropped from his unnerved hand, he groaned and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the floor, the noi&s;e of his fall brought up a &s;ervant of the hou&s;e, proper remedies were applied and &s;oon re&s;tored him to a keen &s;en&s;e of his pa&s;t guilt and treachery to Dorcas, for Major Renfew was the perjured hu&s;band whom Dorcas had concealed under the name of Melfont.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thought that &s;truck him was the horrid crime he had &s;o nearly perpetrated; the next was what was become of his poor ruined child&mdash;His continual ravings for his Marian, his dear lo&s;t daughter, and the evident incoherence of his di&s;cour&s;e led the &s;ervants to believe he was &s;eized with a &s;udden fit of in&s;anity, and in that belief conveyed him home.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="027654_0130_0FD568A6521009E8">
The horror that dwelt upon his mind, and the violent agitation brought on a fever, and before morning he was in&s;en&s;ible to all that pa&s;&s;ed about him. Before rea&s;on entirely for&s;ook him, he was vi&s;ited by the Earl of Landaff, who was his nephew, to him he unfolded the dreadful tale, conjuring him to try every po&s;&s;ible method to di&s;cover the unhappy wanderer.</P>
<P>Oh! &s;aid he in an agony, "&s;he knelt and prayed, my child entreated me, with &s;treaming eyes, to &s;natch her from infamy, and I would not hear her,&mdash;&s;eek her Landaff, find her, &s;ave her from peri&s;hing for want." The remembrance was too acute, and his &s;en&s;es, which were before wa|vering, took their flight&mdash;but &s;till his fancy was haunted by the image of Dorcas and Marian, and his agonies became dreadful, even to tho&s;e who attended him.</P>
<P>Every enquiry after the haple&s;s Marian was fruitle&s;s, and the mi&s;erable Renfew, when a turn of his di&s;order re&s;tored him to rea&s;on, found that there was no hope of recovering the poor wanderer&mdash;</P>
<P>The picture di&s;covered to the Earl of Landaff that Dorcas was the mother and Lydia the &s;i&s;ter of the woman who had cau&s;ed &s;uch anxious emo|tions in his uncle's bo&s;om, but how Lydia and

<P>He determined to &s;eek Dorcas in her &s;olitude, and acknowledge her to the world as his fir&s;t and only true affianced wife; but fearing to alarm her by too abrupt an appearance, he addre&s;&s;ed her fir&s;t by letter.</P>

<P>From the day of Marian's elopement plea&s;ure had been a &s;tranger to the heart of Dorcas, nor could all the duteous tenderne&s;s of Lydia di&s;&s;i|pate the anxiety &s;he felt for the fate of Marian from her maternal brea&s;t.

<HEAD>MARIAN AND LYDIA. PART VI.</HEAD>
<P>'TWAS night, a chearful fire illumined their little cottage, but &s;orrow &s;till &s;at heavy on the heart of Dorcas&mdash;the wind blew, the cold rain beat again&s;t the ca&s;ement; and where now is my poor Marian? &s;aid &s;he, &s;ighing deeply.</P>
<P>I will &s;ing you your favorite hymn, &s;aid Lydia, ki&s;&s;ing off a tear as it fell on her mother's cheek, and &s;truggling to &s;uppre&s;s its &s;ympathi&s;ing &s;i&s;ter that trembled in her own eye.</P>
<P>She took up her guitar, &s;he wi&s;hed to divert her mother's attention from the painful reflections which then occupied her thoughts; &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her fingers acro&s;s the &s;trings, the tones were di&s;cordant, it is not in tune, &s;aid &s;he. Alas! my dear Lydia, replied her mother, it is our minds that are not harmonized. She under&s;tood the meaning of her mother's words, but, making no an&s;wer, began to

&s;ing an evening hymn of thanks. The &s;udden trampling of a hor&s;e interrupted her, a loud rapping at the door alarmed them&mdash;Lydia opened the door, a &s;ervant entered. Dorcas looked earne&s;tly at him; he threw a&s;ide his rid|ing coat, &s;he knew the livery, and in&s;tantly re|cognized an old and favorite &s;ervant of Major Renfew.</P>
<P>Simon, &s;aid &s;he, turning pale and ri&s;ing as &s;he &s;poke, why are you here?</P>
<P>My dear honored lady, I come from my ma&s;|ter, who repents his injurious treatment of you, and comes to do you ju&s;tice; but let this let|ter &s;peak for him.</P>
<P>And where is Lady Laura, &s;aid Dorcas, tak|ing the letter.</P>
<P>She left my ma&s;ter &s;ome years &s;ince, and now leads a life of &s;hame.</P>
<P>Poor mi&s;guided Laura, &s;aid Dorcas, as &s;he broke the &s;eal.</P>
<P>When &s;he read the fir&s;t lines joy lightened up her features, and a tran&s;ient glow of plea&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed acro&s;s her face; but as &s;he proceeded her hands trembled, her countenance a&s;&s;umed a dead|ly

<P>Two days after Major Renfew had di&s;patched the letter to Dorcas, he &s;et forward for Wales, accompanied by the Earl of Landaff; it was nearly the clo&s;e of the third day, they had arrived within a few miles of the cottage, and had &s;lack|ened their pace, that a &s;ervant might have time to inform Dorcas of their near approach. The Major's bo&s;om was agitated by the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations, the Earl was animated by hope. The road was &s;olitary, &s;kirted on one &s;ide by a thick wood, from whence they &s;everal times imagined they heard a voice of complaint, the Major &s;topped his hor&s;e and &s;tood in the attitude of li&s;ten|ing.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="027654_0137_0FD568B2C6127568">
Ah! woe is me, &s;aid the voice, I can get no farther, I mu&s;t e'en peri&s;h here.</P>
<P>Landaff di&s;mounted in&s;tantly and ru&s;hed into the wood, the Major would have followed but a &s;udden pang &s;eized him, he re&s;pired with dif|ficulty and was forced to &s;upport him&s;elf again a tree. In a few moments Landaff returned, a fe|male re&s;ted on his arm, her emaciated frame but &s;lenderly &s;heltered from the inclemencies of the weather, by a tattered gown; her hair loo&s;e and di&s;hevelled, her feet bare and bleeding from wounds &s;he had received from &s;harp &s;tones, as &s;he walked. Here is a &s;ight of mi&s;ery, &s;aid the Earl.</P>
<P>The Major looked at the unhappy girl, and through the &s;hade which extreme want, &s;ick|ne&s;s, and even di&s;ordered rea&s;on had ca&s;t over her countenance, in&s;tantly di&s;covered the fea|tures of Marian.</P>
<P>Merciful heaven, he exclaimed, it is my child.</P>
<P>Have you a child, &s;aid Marian, catching at his la&s;t words, then for pity's &s;ake don't for&s;ake her. I had a father once, I had a lover too, but you &s;ee how it is with me now, I am poor, very
<PB N="32" REF="027654_0138_0FD568B558FAB2F8">
wretched, and I &s;ometimes think not quite in my right &s;en&s;es. I have a mother who lives &s;ome|where here about, I have travelled a long way in hopes to find her, but I know not how it is, I have eat &s;o little, and wept &s;o much, I was obliged to &s;it down and re&s;t. Do but &s;ee how my poor feet bleed.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear child, cried the Major, you make my heart bleed drop for drop with them; but I am going to your mother's, and will &s;hew you the way.</P>
<P>You are a man, &s;aid &s;he, and I dare not tru&s;t you; they are all hard-hearted, cruel and trea|cherous. I once, continued &s;he; looking ear|ne&s;tly in the Major's face, I once met a man, but 'tis a long time &s;ince, who looked and &s;poke as you do, only not quite &s;o &s;orrowful&mdash;I was mi&s;erable then, and he promi&s;ed to be my friend, but he did not mean it; he u&s;ed me very cruelly, I hardly know how I got from him, and have been wandering about ever &s;ince, &s;ometimes one cold &s;tone, &s;ometimes another has been my pillow. I bear it as well as I can, we all mu&s;t &s;uffer according to our offences.</P>
<P>Dear lunatic, &s;aid the Major, what a le&s;&s;on do&s;t thou teach thy father.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="027654_0139_0FD568B6C9A29D20">
That is true, &s;aid &s;he, you have a child, if it is a daughter, bring her to me, and I will teach her &s;uch a le&s;&s;on&mdash;I have it here (laying her hand on her heart) it can never be era&s;ed but by the hand of death. Oh! I would tell her &s;uch tales of men, would teach her to beware their flat|tery, to &s;hut her&s;elf in retirement, to pray for humility. Oh! fye upon it, fye upon it, 'tis a bad world, but I'll to my mother, for I am &s;ick, heart-&s;ick of its follies.</P>
<P>She then darted precipitately into the wood, but had not proceeded many &s;teps, when over|come with fatigue, long fa&s;ting, and the agita|tion of her di&s;ordered &s;pirits, &s;he &s;unk under the complicated evils, and fell fainting to the ground.</P>
<P>Renfew was too much ab&s;orbed in his own feel|ings to be able to give any orders concerning his unhappy daughter, and could only exclaim, "The&s;e are thy works, oh vice; look, old Ren|few, behold the ruin of thy child, and remember 'tis the reward of thy own ingratitude, perfidy and cruelty."</P>
<P>Landaff a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;ervants in rai&s;ing Marian, and being then but a &s;hort di&s;tance from the cot|tage, per&s;uaded his uncle to ride forward, accom|panied by one &s;ervant, while he followed with
<PB N="34" REF="027654_0140_0FD568BA704062F0">
the other two &s;upporting Marian between them. And is this the peace offering I &s;hall carry to my afflicted Dorcas, a daughter murdered by the inhumanity of a father, &s;aid the Major as he proceeded.</P>
<P>Dorcas had been li&s;tening to every pa&s;&s;ing breeze, and counting the minutes, chiding their tardy progre&s;s. The &s;ound of hor&s;es feet caught her ear, &s;he met her repentant Renfew at the door, threw her&s;elf into his arms, and fainted. Lydia knelt and received a father's ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Words are too languid to de&s;cribe the en&s;u|ing &s;cene, &s;uffice it to &s;ay, for Marian was for a moment forgot, for a moment they were all happy; but they were awakened from this dream of bli&s;s by the approach of Landaff.</P>
<P>Lydia &s;tarted as &s;he drew near the door, Renfew &s;truck his forehead with his hand, and bur&s;ting from the embraces of Dorcas, ru&s;hed out of the room.</P>
<P>Marian was beginning to recover her &s;en&s;es as they entered the cottage. Lydia thought it was a &s;tranger, poor and &s;ickly, and as &s;he lent her arm to a&s;&s;i&s;t in leading her in, a tear fell in compa&s;&s;ion to her weakne&s;s and apparent mi|&s;ery.
<PB N="35" REF="027654_0141_0FD568BE21165640">
Marian &s;unk into a chair, folded her arms round Lydia's wai&s;t, and gazing at her for a moment, recollection and rea&s;on at once returned, &s;he dropped her head on her bo&s;om and cried, it is indeed my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>The voice was familiar to Dorcas. That voice &s;hould be the voice of Marian, &s;aid &s;he, but alas! the form retains no traces of my once lovely innocent child.</P>
<P>Innocence and peace are fled together, &s;aid Marian, grant me but pardon and let me die at your feet; &s;he &s;unk upon her knees, Lydia knelt be&s;ide her; the afflicted mother wept over her, ble&s;&s;ed and forgave her.</P>
<P>Enough, &s;aid Marian, this was the only prayer I dared to offer at the throne of grace &s;ince I left my home, and became acquainted with guilt and mi&s;ery; how it has plea&s;ed heaven to direct me to you I know not. I have &s;ome faint recollec|tion of an horrid dream, but all things &s;eem fading from my memory, an icy chillne&s;s hangs about my heart, I feel the &s;prings of life are quite exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>Oh! &s;pare her, &s;pare my child, merciful heaven, cried Dorcas, &s;inking on her knees.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="027654_0142_0FD568BF099863F0">
It cannot be, &s;aid the expiring &s;ufferer, I die, but a mother's ble&s;&s;ing &s;oftens even the agonies of death, Oh! had I but de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>She rai&s;ed her hands and eyes in a fervent though inarticulate ejaculation to heaven, and uttering a piercing groan expired.</P>
<P>Renfew heard the groan, he heard the cries of Dorcas and Lydia&mdash;"And is &s;he dead, &s;aid he, ru&s;hing in and catching the pale cor&s;e in his arms, Oh! Marian! Marian! why &s;houlde&s;t thou pay the forfeit of thy father's crimes? But tell me, continued he, who was her &s;educer; who plunged my child into this aby&s;s of mi&s;ery; teach me where to find him, that with his heart's blood I may wa&s;h out the &s;tain he has entailed upon the name of Renfew."</P>
<P>Forbear, &s;aid Dorcas, laying her hand upon his arm, while a beam of mingled piety and fortitude illumined her countenance, forbear, the hand of heaven is in it, accept its ju&s;t cha&s;ti&s;e|ments with humility, and remembering only thine own offences, blot from thy memory the offences of others.</P>
<P>Renfew turned from her, folded his arms upon his bo&s;om, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="027654_0143_0FD568C0F01F3E90">
A few days after the ill-fated Marian was com|mitted to her parent earth, when Renfew, Dor|cas, and Lydia removed to the &s;eat of the Earl of Landaff, where in a &s;hort time &s;he reaped the full reward of her filial duty and unremitting tender|ne&s;s to her mother, by becoming the bride of that young nobleman. She was the ble&s;&s;ing of her parents, the pride and honor of her hu&s;band, the friend and preceptre&s;s of her children, who re|paid an hundred fold the plea&s;ure &s;he had con|veyed to Dorcas's bo&s;om by &s;hewing the &s;ame duty and affection to her.</P>
<P>Major Renfew purcha&s;ed the cottage where his wife and children had lived &s;o many years, and kept it in con&s;tant repair; in the garden he had two &s;mall temples erected, one was almo&s;t hid from the eye, by thick &s;preading cypre&s;s and yew trees, round who&s;e branches twined the deadly night-&s;hade, and baleful ivy; within was a tomb of black marble, over which &s;tood Hu|manity weeping; on the front of the monument was the following in&s;cription:</P>

<P>Beware the voice of flattery, beware the allurements of wealth, nor a&s;k of thy bountiful Creator aught but HUMILITY, VIRTUE AND CONTENT.</P>
<P>The other temple was built of white marble, &s;urrounded by the mo&s;t beautiful flowering &s;hrubs and evergreens; within was Peace and Pro&s;perity, &s;howering their favors on filial piety; above ho|vered an Angel with a crown of gold in her hands, round which was this heavenly promi&s;e:

<P>STILL am I to complain of the &s;hortne&s;s of your letters, and receive the trifling excu&s;e, that you have no time. Fye, my dear girls, I am a&s;hamed to read &s;o very childi&s;h an apology, your want of time mu&s;t proceed from your own bad management, for &s;urely no rational being will give more to the pur&s;uit of amu&s;ement than what might ju&s;t &s;erve to give a ze&s;t to retirement; and, believe me, you will find retirement alone the &s;ource of true happine&s;s, and promoter of in|du&s;try&mdash;and on the contrary, an eager pur&s;uit of fa&s;hionable folly, which &s;educes you under the &s;emblance of plea&s;ure, always tends to debilitate the faculties of the mind, and lead you into habits of idlene&s;s and indolence at once prejudicial to your tranquillity and intere&s;t, not only your tem|poral, but what is of far more con&s;equence, your &s;piritual intere&s;t.</P>

friend, who regards you with a tenderne&s;s nearly maternal; tell me, and tell me truly, I entreat, how much time you can &s;pare to devote each day to the Creator and giver of all good? Ah! my young friends, I fear but a little, very little por|tion is allotted for that &s;ervice; yet tru&s;t me it is a &s;ervice which cannot be neglected but by the ungrateful and unthinking. Is there one mo|ment of your lives that pa&s;&s;es unmarked by his ble&s;&s;ings? Have you not health, chearfulne&s;s, friends, and the mo&s;t valuable of all ble&s;&s;ings, the power to dry the tear of affliction, to comfort the widow, protect the orphan, relea&s;e the poor debtor, and perform all the good works of peace and mercy?</P>
<P>How &s;hould your hearts overflow with gratitude to that God, who thus bountifully &s;preads around you the means of happine&s;s, do not then my dear children, throw the ble&s;&s;ing from you, and con|tinue &s;quandering your time, and trifling with your health 'till the fir&s;t is nearly &s;pent, and the latter irretrievably ruined, and you will awaken too late to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of your error, when your mind, evervated by the weakne&s;s of your frame, vainly &s;hall endeavour in the few remaining years to regain tho&s;e &s;ources of mental delight which ever &s;low from a proper exertion of the rea&s;oning faculties.</P>

When you were with me, was there ever a day too long? I hear you readily an&s;wer no. Every moment was fully and plea&s;antly em|ployed; true, but had we not always time for reading, writing, mu&s;ic, drawing, needle-work, and every other amu&s;ing or u&s;eful employment. And did we ever, my dear girls, ri&s;e from the &s;weets of repo&s;e, or retire to our chambers at night, without remembering our duty to him through who&s;e mercy alone we enjoyed all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings? and certain I am, you were at that time as happy as it was po&s;&s;ible for young people to be; you were blithe as the woodlark, bloom|ing as Hebe, and innocent as the dove, who tries his new fledged wings in little circles round its mother's ne&s;t.</P>
<P>Think not, my young friends, that I wi&s;h to deprive you of innocent amu&s;ement, far from it. In the &s;phere where it has plea&s;ed providence to place you, it is certainly right that you &s;hould partake in moderation of all the diver&s;ions of the metropolis; but if tho&s;e diver&s;ions are too fre|quently repeated, they lo&s;e their effect, and you return from them weary, di&s;gu&s;ted and di&s;|&s;atisfied.</P>

<P>I am no &s;tranger to the many enticements youth and inexperience meet with in the gay world to allure them from the paths of rea&s;on.

<P>Your grandmother, my dear girls, was a wo|man remarkable for the elogance of her manners and the chearfulne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition; yet be|lieve me &s;he was as truly pious as a primitive chri&s;tian. Surrounded with affluence, &s;he was humble, benevolent, tender hearted, and ea&s;y of acce&s;s to the meane&s;t petitioner. In affliction re&s;igned, patient and uncomplaining.</P>

years old, extremely lovely in her per&s;on, en|dowed with every accompli&s;hment, admired wherever &s;he appeared, re&s;pected by her friends, and adored by her hu&s;band: yet &s;he was not tainted by vanity, but made it her &s;tudy to con|ciliate e&s;teem, when love and admiration &s;hould be no more. She paid a &s;trict attention to her dome&s;tic affairs, attended per&s;onally to the mo|rals and education of her children, never &s;uffer|ed an hour to pa&s;s unemployed, or a day without paying her devotion to her maker.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>AND &s;o you really feel your&s;elves mightily offended becau&s;e your father thinks of a &s;e|cond marriage, when you &s;hould rather rejoice to find he has cho&s;en &s;o amiable a woman as Mrs. Clairville.</P>
<P>You are to con&s;ider that it is more than pro|bable in a few years you will all of you be &s;ettled in a matrimonial way, and then how extremely un|comfortable will your father find him&s;elf, after being &s;o long accu&s;tomed to the &s;ociety of an amiable woman, to feel him&s;elf at once deprived of it, how &s;olitary would be his hou&s;e, how pen|&s;ive his breakfa&s;t hours.</P>
<P>But you cry, you do not like a &s;tep-mother. Can you &s;uppo&s;e that Mrs. Clairville will a&s;&s;ume any improper authority over you when &s;he becomes Lady Winworth?&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="027654_0151_0FD568D057020F78">
Believe me, my children, while you behave with tenderne&s;s and propriety towards her, &s;he will never appear otherwi&s;e than your friend and companion. Be&s;ides, you &s;hould reflect that your father having di&s;charged his duty towards you, by giving you a liberal education, and re|maining unmarried till you have attained to years of maturity, has now an undoubted right to plea&s;e him&s;elf, and chu&s;e a companion &s;uited to his age and di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;And &s;hall you, the chil|dren of his affection, who&s;e happine&s;s he has &s;o much &s;tudied, who&s;e felicity is the fir&s;t wi&s;h of his heart, &s;hall you ungratefully murmur at his choice, and by your di&s;content embitter the life of him it is your duty to love and reverence.</P>
<P>No, no.&mdash;I think my dear girls know too well the many obligations they are under to this dear father, to attempt any thing which would be pre|judicial to his happine&s;s. Con&s;ider, my dear girls, how much it will be your intere&s;t to endeavour to conciliate the affection and e&s;teem of the wo|man whom your father thinks proper to place in &s;o re&s;pectable a &s;ituation. You mu&s;t regard her as the repre&s;entative of your decea&s;ed parent, and by tender a&s;&s;iduity and attention, make her your &s;incere friend; &s;uch a conduct will make you dearer than ever <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the heart of your father, and a delightful tranquillity will diffu&s;e it&s;elf through your own bo&s;oms, con&s;cious that to the

utmo&s;t of your power you have performed your duty.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may tell me, there is no actual duty due to a &s;tep-mother. I confe&s;s it is not &s;o much a duty incumbent for you to obey the commands or &s;ubmit implicitly to the will of any but your natural parent, but remember my fair friends, if you voluntarily perform an exalted action, where perhaps it was not expected, and could not be demanded, how much more will it redound to your honor, than the &s;imple di&s;|charge of an obligation.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that many young women have been rendered extremely unhappy by their fa|ther's choo&s;ing &s;econd wives, but then it has been the error of judgment in his choice; where pa&s;|&s;ion has &s;o blinded him that he could not di&s;cover the faults of the per&s;on who had attracted his af|fection. Perhaps &s;he has been ignorant, ill-na|tured, illiberal, or fanta&s;tic; nay, it has been the unhappy fate of &s;ome girls to have for a &s;tep-mother, a per&s;on in whom all tho&s;e di&s;agree|able circum&s;tances are combined. But what a different choice has your father made, Mrs. Clair|ville is elegant, accompli&s;hed, gentle and una&s;|&s;uming. She will render your father's evening of life like the parting rays of a mild autumn day, where though we cannot but &s;ee the vi&s;ible

approach of winter, there is &s;uch a &s;oft &s;erenity, &s;uch various beauties &s;cattered over the pro&s;pect, that the reflecting mind cannot but prefer it to the more gaudy tints that embelli&s;h the appearance of &s;pring.</P>
<P>Your own felicity too may be augmented by this union, as I am certain, however vanity or folly may for a moment mi&s;lead your under&s;tand|ing, you will all &s;incerely rejoice in an event that will ultimately tend to in&s;ure the mo&s;t re|fined plea&s;ure to &s;o good, &s;o valuable a father, as Lord Winworth, by uniting him to a woman, who&s;e highly cultivated under&s;tanding renders her at once the chearful rational companion, and the di&s;intere&s;ted friend.</P>
<P>You may remember, my dear girls, how un|kind you thought me, when I po&s;itively refu&s;ed to accompany you to London; perhaps you may now perceive the ju&s;tice of that refu&s;al. Had I complied with the polite invitation of your fa|ther, and yielded my own better judgment to your pre&s;&s;ing entreaties, I &s;hould have undoubt|edly long ago forfeited, in your opinion, all right to your affection.</P>
<P>Some years before Lord Winworth beheld your truly amiable mother, he &s;o far humbled him&s;elf as to make me a tender of his hand and fortune. I

will not dwell on the rea&s;on that urged me to re|fu&s;e an offer &s;o very far above my de&s;erts, lea&s;t my dear Mi&s;s Winworths &s;hould think I boa&s;ted of my great fortitude and re&s;olution; believe me, it was only an exertion of rea&s;on, and I felt amply compen&s;ated for all I &s;uffered in this &s;elf-denial, (for I will not deny that my heart pleaded &s;trong|ly in your father's favor) by the reflection that I had acted with honour and propriety, and evinced the &s;incerity of my gratitude to my dear benefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>Affections that have been deeply impre&s;&s;ed on our hearts in extreme youth, are often revived again at the remote period of mature age, and I feared to lo&s;e the friend&s;hip of my young friends, by awakening in the bo&s;om of their father the ten|derne&s;s he once honored me with, by profe&s;&s;ing&mdash;.</P>
<P>Before I drop this &s;ubject, I will give you two in&s;tances that have fell under my own immediate knowledge, to &s;hew you how very po&s;&s;ible it is for an ob&s;tinate mi&s;judging child to trifle away both her own and father's happine&s;s, by being wil|fully blind to the merits of his &s;econd wife; and al&s;o &s;hew how truly amiable the daughter mu&s;t appear, who makes the tranquillity of her parent her chief &s;tudy; and if her own peace is in &s;ome mea&s;ure interrupted by the caprice of a &s;tep mo|ther, &s;he will &s;eek in re&s;ignation, piety and hu|mility, a &s;weet con&s;olation and comfort.</P>

Celia Markham had the mi&s;fortune to lo&s;e her mother at the early age of twelve. Mr. Mark|ham was doatingly fond of his daughter, he placed his chief felicity in the hope of one day &s;eeing her the mo&s;t amiable, accompli&s;hed and happy girl in England.</P>
<P>He had placed her at an eminent boarding &s;chool, but he knew too much of the world to &s;uppo&s;e, a girl of her volatile di&s;po&s;ition, e&s;pe|cially when &s;he was lovely in her per&s;on, and reputed heire&s;s to a large fortune, could be &s;o &s;afe any where as under the immediate protec|tion of a father. He had no female relation whom he could with propriety invite to his hou&s;e, and he thought he could not do his daugh|ter a more acceptable &s;ervice, than by choo&s;ing the amiable Mi&s;s Nel&s;on to pre&s;ide in the place of her departed mother.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Nel&s;on was at that time upwards of thirty, &s;he had rendered her&s;elf univer&s;ally beloved and re&s;pected by all who knew her, for the innate goodne&s;s of her heart was con&s;picuous in every action. She had received a mo&s;t liberal education, and her mental endowments were far &s;uperior to the generality of what is termed accompli&s;hed women&mdash;yet &s;o timid and una&s;&s;uming in her manners, that tho&s;e with whom &s;he conver&s;ed by
<PB N="50" REF="027654_0156_0FD568DA153DBA98">
degrees di&s;covered her excellencies, and after &s;ome years acquaintance would be daily finding &s;omething new to admire. She had by the mo&s;t exemplary conduct as a daughter, convinced the world what might be expected from her as a wife and mother. She was uniformly humane, pious and gentle; in per&s;on attractive, and in manners elegantly &s;imple.</P>
<P>Such was the woman whom Mr. Markham thought would help to form the manners, culti|vate the under&s;tanding, and direct the &s;tudies of his darling Celia.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Markham no &s;ooner was informed of her father's intended union, than &s;he conceived the mo&s;t violent and ill founded di&s;like toward the innocent object of his affection.</P>
<P>As Celia was &s;o young, Mr. Markham never had an idea of con&s;ulting her on his propo&s;ed mar|riage, having therefore obtained from Mi&s;s Nel|&s;on leave to name an early day for the ceremony, he wrote to his daughter an affectionate letter, informing her how much he had &s;tudied her hap|pine&s;s in providing her &s;o amiable a friend and preceptre&s;s, at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting her go|verne&s;s to prepare her to be pre&s;ent at the wed|ding.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="027654_0157_0FD568E1904B10F8">
Celia was a girl of high &s;pirits, her under|&s;tanding had remained entirely uncultivated, while large &s;ums had been expended on the far le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments of mu&s;ic, dan|cing, drawing, and fancy works. Religion &s;he knew but by name; it is true, there were prayers read twice a-day in the &s;chool, and &s;he went with the other ladies regularly to church twice every Sunday, but there it re&s;ted. There had been no pains taken to in&s;til into her mind a true knowledge of what religion meant; &s;he had not been taught that to keep her pa&s;&s;ions under the controul of rea&s;on, to &s;ubmit, without repining, to the will of tho&s;e whom heaven had placed over her; to be meek, merciful, and ju&s;t, and let every action of her life be a continued work of gratitude to hea|ven, and good will to her fellow creatures, was to follow the precepts of true piety.</P>
<P>She had been early taught to value her&s;elf, upon the trifling advantages of birth and fortune, for &s;he &s;aw the vi&s;ible difference between the at|tention and re&s;pect paid by her governe&s;s and the teachers to her&s;elf and tho&s;e young ladies who had neither of tho&s;e advantages to recommend them.</P>
<P>She was naturally vain, and that vanity was augmented by the con&s;tant adulation which &s;he daily received from tho&s;e girls, who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="52" REF="027654_0158_0FD568DB89BB12D8">
of &s;pirit induced them to cringe to her &s;uperior wealth.</P>
<P>From con&s;tantly contemplating tho&s;e fancied endowments, &s;he began to imagine &s;he was born for univer&s;al &s;way, had &s;ettled it in her own mind, that in a few years &s;he &s;hould be called home to pre&s;ide at her father's table, have the manage|ment of the family, and partake of all the fa|&s;hionable plea&s;ures with which the metropolis abounds.</P>
<P>How great then was her di&s;appointment when &s;he found all the&s;e plea&s;ing expectations at once fru&s;trated&mdash;when &s;he found &s;he was to be &s;till con|&s;idered as a child, and under the controul of the mo&s;t dreaded of all characters, a &s;tep-mother.&mdash;</P>
<P>She knew Mi&s;s Nel&s;on, but far from admiring her amiable qualities, &s;he had con&s;idered her as a dull, preci&s;e, in&s;ipid old maid. She had no idea that chearfulne&s;s and unaffected piety con&s;tantly in|habited the &s;ame brea&s;t, nor could &s;he conceive that rational conver&s;ation, &s;tudy, u&s;eful employ|ment, and innocent amu&s;ement, could amply di|ver&s;ify the &s;cene, and be a &s;ource of tranquil hap|pine&s;s without the aid of public entertainments, dre&s;s, parade and folly.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="027654_0159_0FD568E341487208">
It may be ea&s;ily conceived, that two tempers &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite would never agree.</P>
<P>Mr. Markham had &s;een the&s;e erroneous traits in his daughter's di&s;po&s;ition, but he flattered him&s;elf, the amiable example and conde&s;cend|ing behaviour of Mi&s;s Nel&s;on would &s;o far ope|rate on her temper, as to make her love and en|deavour to imitate her virtues.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the rage and grief that di&s;played it&s;elf in the countenance of Celia, on the receipt of her father's letters, regarding only what &s;he fooli&s;hly imagined would be preju|dicial to her own happine&s;s. She gave vent to her pa&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t unbecoming terms, called her father cruel, unju&s;t and unfeeling, and vowed &s;he would die &s;ooner than call Mi&s;s Nel&s;on mother. "I will go to the wedding, &s;aid &s;he, becau&s;e that woman &s;hall not have a moment's happine&s;s of which it is in my power to deprive her."</P>
<P>With this <HI>laudable</HI> re&s;olution &s;he &s;at forward for her father's hou&s;e, where upon being tenderly embraced by him, in&s;tead of returning a cordial &s;alute, and wi&s;hing him joy, &s;he turned her face from him and bur&s;ting into tears, (which pro|ceeded more from pa&s;&s;ion than &s;en&s;ibility) &s;aid &s;he was &s;orry to find her dear mother was &s;o &s;oon forgot.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="027654_0160_0FD568DE016EED98">
Not forgot, my beloved; replied Mr. Mark|ham, for I have &s;ought a woman who is her coun|ter-part in every amiable quality.</P>
<P>They then proceeded to church, where, after the ceremony was performed, tears and &s;ullen curt|&s;eys were all the gratulations Celia offered to her new mother.</P>
<P>Mrs. Markham was naturally a woman of great &s;en&s;ibility &s;he attributed Celia's melancholy to a cau&s;e that did honour to her own heart, and in|&s;tead of taking offence, endeavoured to &s;oothe and entertain her during the whole day. But alas! the gentle Mrs. Markham knew not the difficulty of the ta&s;k &s;he had undertaken. She had known Celia &s;ome years before her mother's death, and always thought her an a|miable, lively girl, and judging of her di&s;po|&s;ition by that of her parents, imagined there would be no difficulty in modelling her accord|ing to her own wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>But the&s;e fallacious hopes were &s;oon no more. Celia from the day of her father's marriage took every opportunity in her power to thwart and vex her mother-in-law.</P>
<P>Though Mrs. Markham was a woman of too much &s;en&s;e, to let the caprice of &s;uch a girl ruffle
<PB N="55" REF="027654_0161_0FD568E61847F140">
the uncommon &s;erenity of her temper, yet was it totally impo&s;&s;ible for a woman of her exqui|&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, to enjoy any tolerable degree of happine&s;s while &s;he &s;aw the darling child of the man &s;he loved and e&s;teemed of &s;o froward and perver&s;e a di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Celia was volatile, and thoughtle&s;s to exce&s;s, fond of company, and &s;o entirely unqualified to amu&s;e or entertain her&s;elf, that the mo&s;t improper &s;ociety was preferred to being alone. Her mo|ther-in-law was of too grave and rational a turn to afford her any plea&s;ure by her conver&s;ation, and to read or work required &s;o much attention, that &s;he termed it fatigue.</P>
<P>It was with infinite regret that Mr. Markham di&s;covered the little felicity he was like to enjoy in this &s;econd union. He &s;aw the child of his tendere&s;t affection re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;contented; he &s;aw with angui&s;h the many fruitle&s;s endeavours of Mrs. Markham to reclaim and make her pur&s;ue the direct road to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Whenever the tender attention of this amiable woman lead her to remon&s;trate with Celia on the impropriety of her conduct, and the mi&s;erable wa&s;te of her time, the petulant girl would bur&s;t into tears, and cry, "Oh! that my dear mother was living, I &s;hould not then be treated thus cru|elly,
<PB N="56" REF="027654_0162_0FD568E08369D720">
and abridged of every innocent plea&s;ure, by a woman, who having &s;tolen from me my dear father's affections, now u&s;urps and undue authority over both him and me."</P>
<P>The&s;e continual di&s;putes greatly embittered Mrs. Markham's life.&mdash;Mr. Markham was at a lo&s;s how to conduct him&s;elf &s;o as to give pain to neither wife or daughter. In &s;hort, the whole family was unhappy from the capricious beha|viour of her, who&s;e chief &s;tudy &s;hould have been to promote their felicity.</P>
<P>Celia had her friends, her parties, and her &s;ecrets, in which Mrs. Markham was not allowed to participate; the con&s;equence was, that &s;he at a very early age had her lovers al&s;o.</P>
<P>Among the many candidates for her favor was a Captain Par&s;low, he was a man of no fortune, ignorant, conceited, and a complete coxcomb. He &s;oon di&s;covered the weakne&s;s of Celia, he flattered her foibles, took her part again&s;t her mo|ther-in-law, and, in &s;hort, &s;o far won on the fooli&s;h thoughtle&s;s girl, that &s;he con&s;ented to elope with him, and take a trip to Scotland.</P>
<P>By the dropping of a letter Mrs. Markham di&s;covered the plan; &s;he talked to Celia in the accents of friend&s;hip and &s;end &s;olicitude but re|ceived
<PB N="57" REF="027654_0163_0FD568EA7492B998">
in return, only impertinence and di&s;re|&s;pect.</P>
<P>Mrs. Markham thought it her duty to acquaint her hu&s;band with the di&s;covery &s;he had made. Grieved to the &s;oul, he &s;ent for his daughter, and in the mo&s;t pathetic terms entreated her to de&s;i&s;t from &s;o fatal a &s;tep.</P>
<P>The artful Celia thought this was the time to alienate her father's affections from his wife&mdash;&s;he po&s;itively denied the whole charge, and declared &s;he believed it mu&s;t be a contrivance of Mrs. Markham';; begged if her dear father thought her capable of &s;uch imprudence, he would &s;end her abroad, and &s;hut her in a convent. "I know, continued &s;he, with well di&s;&s;embled tears, that you have been taught to con&s;ider your poor girl as an abandoned wretch, who con&s;ulted only her own happine&s;s, but indeed, indeed my be|loved father, you have been deceived. I am not the guilty creature you think me. But, alas! I have long &s;een my pre&s;ence is a bar to your hap|pine&s;s, &s;end me from you, then, dear Sir; &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible we can both enjoy content, let me be the victim, and may your felicity be un|bounded."</P>
<P>This artful &s;peech had the de&s;ired effect, and Mr. Markham believing his daughter perfectly
<PB N="58" REF="027654_0164_0FD568EC21230840">
innocent, began to treat the woman with coolne&s;s whom he imagined had attempted to create di&s;|&s;ention between him and his only child.</P>
<P>Celia &s;aw &s;he had now completely made her mother-in-law unhappy, and exulted in her cru|elty, adding in&s;ult to the already poignant &s;uffer|ings of the patient and amiable Mrs. Markham.</P>
<P>But Celia had not &s;ufficient art to elude or evade the &s;olicitude of her admirer. Par&s;low &s;till continued his devoirs, and Mi&s;s Markham li&s;tened to his flattery and received his a&s;&s;iduities with too much plea&s;ure to give any room for de&s;pair; in a &s;hort time &s;he eloped. Her father was amazed, and how much was his a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;ed when the following letter was put into his hand.</P>

<P>The feelings of a father on the receipt of &s;uch a letter are more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed. He had long con&s;idered his innocent wife as a per&s;on who bad di&s;turbed the peace of his family, and now that he imagined him&s;elf convinced of her unju&s;t conduct towards his daughter, his di&s;|plea&s;ure knew no bounds; rage, invective, and bitter reproach, were all the gentle, meek, un|complaining &s;ufferer received from a hu&s;band
<PB N="60" REF="027654_0166_0FD568F27B192298">
who once fondly e&s;teemed her. But though Mrs. Markham complained not the di&s;tre&s;s of her mind preyed upon her delicate frame, &s;he &s;ank under this unexpected mi&s;fortune, and a rapid decline in a few months put a period to her exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>In the mean time Celia and her hu&s;band had been received and forgiven by Mr. Markham; but, alas! that too indulgent father &s;oon di&s;co|vered, that in the lo&s;s of his wife, he had been bereft of every earthly comfort; his daughter ra|ther triumphed in, than endeavoured to &s;oothe his melancholy&mdash;&s;he threw out the mo&s;t illiberal cen&s;ures on the memory of the decea&s;ed Mrs. Markham, and having no longer any particular end to attain by pretending violent affection to her father, &s;he at fir&s;t began to flight and at length totally neglected him.</P>
<P>He felt, acutely felt, her unkindne&s;s, but &s;till his affection led him to lavi&s;h immen&s;e &s;ums to &s;upport the extravagance of her&s;elf and hu&s;band 'till unable any longer to keep them from ruin, he gave up all but about one hundred pounds a year, with which he retired into the country, and ended his days in what he called <HI>peaceful ob&s;curity.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE taken up my pen, without farther preface to proceed on my promi&s;ed &s;tory, and &s;hall leave my dear Mi&s;s Winworths to apply the moral them&s;elves; &s;en&s;ible that they do not went &s;en&s;e to di&s;cover right from wrong, and &s;incerely hoping they will not let folly, vanity, or illiberal prejudices mi&s;lead their judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. O&s;borne was left a widower at a very early age, with only one daughter, named Serena, who, when &s;he had the mi&s;fortune to lo&s;e her mother, was &s;carcely three years old. She inhe|rited by the death of her mother, a genteel inde|pendence, and was reputed heire&s;s to her father's fortune, which was not incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Not long after this melancholy event Mr. O&s;|bore, being on a vi&s;it to a friend in the country, became acquainted with Mi&s;s Withers.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="027654_0170_0FD568FAD1550300">
She was, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, beautiful in the extreme, but that acknowledged, and there was not another favorable circum&s;tance to be men|tioned in her behalf. She was the daughter of a man who enjoyed in a country town, a con&s;ider|able and lucrative po&s;t under government; his wife had brought him four or five thou&s;and pounds, which had been accumulated by her father, who regarded not the cries of the fatherle&s;s, or the tears of the widow.</P>
<P>This woman's education had been &s;uch as might be expected for the child of a poor petty-fogging lawyer, who by dint of chicanery and dirty em|ployment, was &s;craping a little &s;ordid dro&s;s to|gether, and thought by leaving her a fortune, he left her every nece&s;&s;ary recommendation to &s;ecure her advancement in life; the con&s;equence was, that to the mo&s;t illiberal contracted ideas and con|&s;ummate ignorance, &s;he added the pride and &s;elf conceit of a fir&s;t-rate woman of fa&s;hion; &s;he was extravagantly fond of dre&s;s, parade, and &s;how; but had no idea of any difference being nece&s;&s;ary between the education of a gentlewoman, and that of a trade&s;man's or farmer's daughter.</P>
<P>Brought up under &s;uch a mother, with &s;uch confined notions, Mi&s;s Withers had been t&aacute;ught to believe that the good hou&s;ewife and accom|pli&s;hed
<PB N="65" REF="027654_0171_0FD568FC92B97CD0">
woman, were one and the &s;ame thing. She perfectly under&s;tood the art of cookery, pick|ling pre&s;erving, and all the long &amp;c's. nece&s;&s;ary to form a complete hou&s;e-keeper.</P>
<P>She could work tent-&s;titch, tambour, and cro&s;s|&s;titch, make all her father's, and indeed, all the family linen, knew the cheape&s;t ways of going to market, how to &s;cold and keep her &s;ervants in order; in &s;hort, had been brought up as a com|plete <HI>Mrs. Notable.</HI></P>
<P>But to the fine arts &s;he was a perfect &s;tranger. Mu&s;ic, dancing, or drawing, had no charms for her, nor had &s;he the lea&s;t idea of the plea&s;ures re&s;ulting from a well informed, elegantly culti|vated mind. Haughty, yet mean; ignorant, yet ob&s;tinate in her opinion, however ab&s;urd, and deaf to the voice of conviction.</P>
<P>She had been educated in the &s;tricte&s;t principles of methodi&s;m, yet was &s;he of no fixed religion, having been wearied in her youth by being too rigidly obliged to conform to her parents man|ners; &s;he contracted a di&s;like to her religious du|ties, and at the time Mr. O&s;borne fir&s;t &s;aw her, was of no particular &s;ect whatever.</P>
<P>She had, by the death of her mother, who had
<PB N="66" REF="027654_0172_0FD568FE09686AB0">
been extremely anxious to make her dear Jemima a fortune, ju&s;t come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ten thou|&s;and pounds, and was &s;o in&s;inuating in her man|ner, that &s;he was univer&s;ally well received in all companies, and called one of the be&s;t kind of girls in the world.</P>
<P>Mr. O&s;borne was captivated with her lovely per&s;on and &s;pecious manners, and having made propo&s;als to her guardians, was accepted, and the lady, in due time, became Mrs. O&s;borne.</P>
<P>She had from the fir&s;t of her acquaintance pre|tended a violent attachment to the little Serena, I &s;ay pretended, becau&s;e I have been &s;ince con|vinced &s;he regarded her with an eye of envy and ill-nature from the moment &s;he became her mo|ther-in-law.</P>
<P>In about twelve months Mrs. O&s;borne pre|&s;ented her hu&s;band with a little girl, and &s;olemnly declared, at the time of her birth, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for her to love any child better than &s;he did Serena; and that it &s;hould be her chief &s;tudy to make no difference between the chil|dren.</P>
<P>This was a declaration I, who was pre&s;ent, was by no means plea&s;ed with, as I knew it was
<PB N="67" REF="027654_0173_0FD569030D785188">
not in nature for a woman to love another child &s;o well as her own off&s;pring&mdash;and though a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of duty, and a naturally compa&s;&s;ion|ate heart, might lead a woman to treat with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, a girl, deprived of her natu|ral parent, and thrown, as it were, on her pro|tection; yet it was impo&s;&s;ible but inclination mu&s;t lead her to give the preference to her own child.</P>
<P>As Serena and Jemima (the name of her little half-&s;i&s;ter) grew up, light and &s;hade could not be more oppo&s;ite than their di&s;po&s;itions. Serena was &s;en&s;ible, volatile, and chearful, of a bright genius, fond of the pur&s;uit of knowledge, yet meek, mild and innocent as it was po&s;&s;ible for a human being to be.</P>
<P>Jemima was &s;ullen, proud, ob&s;tinate, and &s;o &s;tupid, that it was not in the power of any ma&s;ters whatever to cultivate a mind rendered impene|trable by nature.</P>
<P>The excellencies which di&s;covered them&s;elves in the mind and di&s;po&s;ition of Serena were &s;o many faults in the eyes of Mrs. O&s;borne, nor did &s;he fail to aggravate every error to which her vo|latility, or thoughtle&s;s innocence might betray her, into crimes, &s;o that by degrees her father's affection
<PB N="68" REF="027654_0174_0FD569072A7C8A88">
became alienated from her, and it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the poor girl to &s;peak, move, or look &s;o as not to give offence. As &s;he advanced towards womanhood, her troubles increa&s;ed&mdash;her high &s;en&s;e of her religious duties was termed hy|pocri&s;y&mdash;her &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility, art; and her fine ta&s;te, and brilliant genius, follies, which would in the end lead her to ruin.</P>
<P>When &s;he had attained the age of &s;ixteen, the beque&s;t of a large fortune obliged her father to vi&s;it Jamaica; he re&s;olved to take his family with him, and had not been there long before Mrs. O&s;borne was &s;eized with one of tho&s;e fevers inci|dent to the climate.</P>
<P>Tenderly and with the utmo&s;t care did Serena watch over her for many months when the di&s;or|der had left her in a weak emaciated &s;tate, did &s;he never quit her bed-&s;ide, admini&s;tering every medicine, nor ever taking re&s;t except what &s;he procured at intervals on a matra&s;s in the &s;ame a|partment. And what was the return &s;he received? Petti&s;hne&s;s di&s;content, and repining. Frequently did Mrs. O&s;borne a&s;k, if &s;he was brought to that &s;trange place to be murdered&mdash;if it was intended &s;he &s;hould be poi&s;oned&mdash;and whether Serena did not know that the doctor de&s;igned to kill her; and the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions were not the effect of de|lirium,
<PB N="69" REF="027654_0175_0FD569040CA6CCD0">
but &s;poken with a coolne&s;s and a&s;perity that tore the heart of the mild affectionate girl to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mrs. O&s;borne at length recovered, when it plea&s;ed heaven to take her hu&s;band from her, and &s;he was left involved in a di&s;agreeable law &s;uit, which was finally terminated to her di&s;advantage, &s;he was ca&s;t with co&s;ts of &s;uit, and returned to England with little more than five hundred pounds remaining.</P>
<P>Now it was that Serena &s;hewed her&s;elf to be the amiable girl I had ever thought her.</P>
<P>When &s;he received her fortune, &s;he &s;ettled an hand&s;ome annuity on Mrs. O&s;borne, and divided the re&s;idue between Jemima and her&s;elf; though at her father's death &s;he had been, by their arts, deprived of any advantage from his fortune, the whole being by will left to Mrs. O&s;borne and her daughter, but providence had ordained that they were not to enjoy it.</P>
<P>To the la&s;t hour that &s;he remained with her mother-in-law, &s;he &s;tudied her happine&s;s only, though I have been informed it was &s;eldom in|deed that &s;he received even the &s;malle&s;t token of approbation. Her &s;ociety was circum&s;cribed, her
<PB N="70" REF="027654_0176_0FD569058B4BCCC8">
amu&s;ements abridged, her mo&s;t innocent actions cen&s;ured, and the gaiety of her heart con&s;trued into levity, and reprimanded at vice; nay, after the alteration in their circum&s;tances, &s;he was &s;uf|fered to perform the mo&s;t menial offices: in &s;hort, my dear girls, her education had been confined, her genius cramped, and had &s;he not been a girl of an uncommon good heart, her di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t have been totally perverted by the con&s;tant re|&s;traint &s;he lived under and the &s;everity with which &s;he was treated; while Jemima was indulged in idlene&s;s, her fault glo&s;&s;ed over, and her perver&s;e haughty di&s;po&s;ition called laudable pride. Yet did I never hear that Serena ever u&s;ed an unbe|coming expre&s;&s;ion to her mother, or made any complaint of unkindne&s;s.</P>
<P>She has been now for &s;ome years married to a de&s;erving man, and &s;till continues to treat Mrs. O&s;borne with the highe&s;t re&s;pect, and her daugh|ter with affection, though the ingratitude of Je|mima often appears, by her unkind neglect of a &s;i&s;ter who &s;acrificed her own intere&s;t to the in|tere&s;t and happine&s;s of her mother.</P>
<P>Serena, though happy in her matrimonial con|nection, is not in affluent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Jemima is lately married to a man of large for|tune, and removed to a di&s;tant part of England,
<PB N="71" REF="027654_0177_0FD5690A40169540">
where, &s;he can &s;eldom find time to write to her &s;i&s;ter, and when &s;he does &s;o far conde&s;cend, it is with &s;uch apparent carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, coldne&s;s, and di&s;tance, that the warm heart of Serena is chilled by the peru&s;al of her letters; yet will I venture to affirm Serena the happier woman of the two.</P>
<P>I happened to mention one day the unmerited treatment &s;he had received, not only from them, but from her other relations; and mark, my dear girls, the an&s;wer I received.</P>
<P>"Were I to &s;ay their unkindne&s;s did not give me pain, I &s;hould be guilty of fal&s;ehood, becau&s;e I have that warm affection in my heart, which expands it with brotherly love towards all my fel|low creatures, and never yet breathed a wi&s;h to the di&s;advantage of a &s;ingle individual. I mourn their afflictions, and rejoice in their pro&s;perity. I am therefore, con&s;cious of not de&s;erving their unkindne&s;s, and wrapt in the integrity of my own heart, from my &s;oul pity the bo&s;om that can har|bour malice or ill will towards any one."</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Mi&s;s Winworths, you &s;ee how much our own happine&s;s depends on our &s;trenu|ou&s;ly cultivating &s;uch philanthropy of temper as may lead us to regard our&s;elves but as &s;econdary
<PB N="72" REF="027654_0178_0FD5690CAC49E018">
objects; the felicity we promote for others will return with double force to our own bo&s;oms, and con&s;cious of having always regarded our fellow creatures as our&s;elves, we can look up with con|fidence to that good providence who will never for&s;ake the children of obedience.</P>

<P>N. B. Soon after this la&s;t letter Lord Winworth was married to Mrs. Clairville, and the young ladies conducting them&s;elves accord|ing to the advice of their amiable friend, Mentoria, found in the new|made Lady Winworth, every engaging quality that could be de&s;ired, to form the polite agreeable companion, the affectionate parent, and &s;incere friend. The corre&s;pondence between Mentoria and her pu|pils was continued for many years, but as the publication of the whole would render this work too exten&s;ive, be&s;ides occa&s;ion unne|ce&s;&s;ary repetitions. I have &s;elected only two more letters, with which I &s;hall clo&s;e the pre&s;ent collection; one addre&s;&s;ed to Mi&s;s Gertrude, on her marriage, and a &s;econd to the &s;ame lady, on the birth of a daughter, written by her venerable friend, when &s;he was in the la&s;t &s;tage of a decline, and ha&s;tily verging towards her place of re&s;t, to which &s;he humbly looked forward with that &s;weet confidence and hea|venly hope which ever elevates the &s;oul of a departing Chri&s;tian.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. MENTORIA TO MISS G. WINWORTH.</HEAD>
<P>I ADDRESS my&s;elf &s;ingly to you, my dear Gertrude, becau&s;e the delicacy of your pre|&s;ent &s;ituation demands my &s;erious attention, and calls up all my tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>I am inexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ed to find you have made choice of &s;o worthy a man as Sir Arthur Fitzgerald, and that your father approves the ob|ject of your &s;election</P>
<P>I think you have acted like a woman of &s;en&s;e and prudence, and I make no doubt but you will pre&s;erve the &s;ame propriety of conduct when a wife, as has evidently characteri&s;ed you while &s;ingle.</P>
<P>I admire that real delicacy which impelled you to give an immediate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion to all tho&s;e pre|tenders who &s;olicited your hand without being able to influence your heart in their favor. There
<PB N="74" REF="027654_0180_0FD5690F68E24730">
cannot be a more de&s;picable pa&s;&s;ion than that in|&s;atiable thir&s;t for admiration, which leads a wo|man to encourage indi&s;criminately the forward advances of every coxcomb, who &s;hall pay them the incen&s;e of flattery, and be continually &s;pread|ing their lures to attract adulation, however in their hearts they may de&s;pi&s;e the per&s;on who of|fers it.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, my dear Gertrude will pardon me, if anxious for her future happine&s;s, I venture to give her my advice and opinion for the pre&s;erva|tion of her felicity in the married &s;tate; it has often been remarked, that a heart is much ea&s;ier gained than kept, and, believe me, it is a very judicious ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>There requires more care, attention, and &s;oli|citude, from the wife to the hu&s;band, than from the mi&s;tre&s;s to her adoring lover. The lover be|ing but &s;eldom with you, &s;ees you only in part, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e you would neither appear before him in a &s;latternly dre&s;s, or with a peevi&s;h a&s;pect. Your clothes will be always put on with neatne&s;s, and your face dre&s;&s;ed in &s;miles. On the contrary, the hu&s;band being always in your company, has an opportunity of di&s;covering every little defect or blemi&s;h in your per&s;on, manners, or di&s;po&s;ition, and the chief &s;tudy of a wife &s;hould
<PB N="75" REF="027654_0181_0FD56910C9779968">
be to guard again&s;t every thing that might create di&s;ta&s;te, or excite di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t place let me recommend a mo&s;t &s;crupulous regard to delicacy and neatne&s;s.</P>
<P>Many young women fooli&s;hly imagine, as &s;oon as they are married, they have a right to under|&s;tand and laugh at an indelicate allu&s;ion, but from this fault, the native purity of your mind will, I am certain, pre&s;erve you, &s;ince nothing but ex|treme ignorance or levity could lead any woman to li&s;ten with apparent plea&s;ure, to an improper tale, or ill timed je&s;t.</P>
<P>There are too many men, nay, even among tho&s;e who call them&s;elves gentlemen, who will not &s;cruple to &s;hock a woman's ears with conver|&s;ation of this kind; but the look of marked di&s;ap|probation and &s;ilent contempt, will never fail to &s;ilence them, unle&s;s they are either brutes or fools, and to &s;uch there is no fear of your being expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next thing is neatne&s;s in your per&s;on and dre&s;s and an equanimity of temper to be pre|&s;erved towards your hu&s;band, and your &s;ervants;&mdash;nothing degrades a gentlewoman more than her &s;uffering her temper to be &s;o far ruffled as to u&s;e improper language to her dependants, nor can
<PB N="76" REF="027654_0182_0FD56914CA6B6F48">
any thing be more di&s;gu&s;ting to a man of &s;en&s;e than to &s;ee his wife give way to &s;udden &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To every relation and friend of your hu&s;band, &s;hew a polite attention and marked preference; &s;hew him, that to be related to, or e&s;teemed by him, is a &s;ufficient claim upon your regard&mdash;whatever be his errors, confine the knowledge of them to your own bo&s;om, and endeavour, by the mide&s;t per&s;ua&s;ions, to lead him to the path of rectitude. Di&s;cretion mu&s;t direct you as to the proper &s;ea&s;on to offer your advice and opinions, &s;ince men in general are &s;o tenacious of their pre|rogative, that they &s;tart from every thing that has the lea&s;t appearance of controul or oppo&s;i|tion. Never atttempt to re&s;train his plea&s;ures; if he &s;hould be fond of company, di&s;&s;ipation and expen&s;ive amu&s;ements, be it your &s;tudy to de|tach his mind from tho&s;e pur&s;uits, by endeavour|ing to render his home delightful, let your face be ever arrayed in &s;miles at his approach, form a &s;o|ciety of tho&s;e he loves and e&s;teems mo&s;t, exert your various abilities to charm and entertain him, and believe me, he who con&s;tantly meets chear|fulne&s;s and &s;miles at home, will &s;eldom wi&s;h to &s;eek abroad for plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Above all things never &s;uffer any per&s;on to &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of him in your pre&s;ence, and
<PB N="77" REF="027654_0183_0FD569168CB50958">
guard your heart from the lea&s;t approach of jea|lou&s;y; &s;hould there even be occa&s;ion for &s;u&s;pi|cion, be careful not to let him &s;ee you have di&s;|covered his di&s;honorable conduct, and never &s;uf|fer any one, more e&s;pecially a <HI>man,</HI> to hear you complain.</P>
<P>Avoid reproaches, they in general increa&s;e ra|ther than alleviate the di&s;tre&s;s; if patient &s;uffer|ing and the mild remon&s;trance of an afflicted un|complaining &s;pirit, will not work a reformation, reproach and di&s;content will have no effect.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not be above attending to his intere&s;t &s;o far as may lead you to in&s;pect the expences of your family; have &s;tated and regular times for examining your hou&s;e-keeper's accounts, and be|ing &s;ati&s;fied that your trades-people are regularly paid, and do not let trifles put you a&s;ide from this very nece&s;&s;ary point.</P>
<P>Let your own expences be regulated by pru|dence void of par&s;imony, and &s;uffer not a pa&s;&s;ion for finery, and a wi&s;h to eclip&s;e your acquaint|ance, prompt you to over&s;tep your income, or deprive you of the inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure of re|lieving indigent merit.</P>
<P>Though I would not have you &s;acrifice too largely at the &s;hrine of that idol, fa&s;hion, I would
<PB N="78" REF="027654_0184_0FD5691793ADEEF0">
have you follow her &s;o far as may make your ap|pearance alway de&s;erve the appellation of ele|gantly neat; nor mu&s;t you confine this appear|ance only to your going abroad or receiving com|pany at home; though you were to be in the country for months, and &s;ee none but your hu&s;|band and &s;ervants, never neglect the real nece&s;|&s;ary duties of the toilet, it is a re&s;pect due to him, it &s;hews a wi&s;h to appear agreeable in his eyes, and that you prefer his approbation to that of all the world be&s;ide.</P>
<P>There is one more circum&s;tance I mu&s;t men|tion, although a thorough knowledge of your di&s;|po&s;ition renders it almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary; yet I have &s;een &s;o many couples made inexpre&s;&s;ibly mi&s;er|able by it, that I cannot re&s;i&s;t my inclination to warn you of &s;o dangerous a conduct.</P>
<P>Never permit any man, however clothed with the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, to treat you with fami|liarity. There are many freedoms, which to a girl may be perfectly innocent, and yet become almo&s;t crimes when offered to, or received by a married woman.</P>
<P>A married woman &s;hould never &s;uffer a man to entertain her in a &s;train of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">antry, a pre&s;&s;ure of the hand is an affront, and an attempt at a &s;a|lute (except where the nearne&s;s of the relation

<HEAD>LETTER X. MENTORIA TO LADY FITZGERALD.</HEAD>
<P>THE news that you were &s;afe in bed, and mo|ther to a daughter, my dear Gertrude, will, believe me, give as much &s;ati&s;faction to my heart, as any &s;ublunary plea&s;ure po&s;&s;ibly can; and, weak as I am, tottering as it were on the very brink of a va&s;t eternity, I cannot re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire I feel, of once more writing to my beloved pupils, for in addre&s;&s;ing Lady Fitzgerald, I &s;uppo&s;e my|&s;elf al&s;o writing to her &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t a few words to your&s;elf, in regard to this dear, this precious little charge, with which it has plea&s;ed heaven to entru&s;t you. May it ever be impre&s;&s;ed on your mind that the future hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery of this child depends greatly on the treatment &s;he receives during her puerile years.</P>
<P>Let not a too great fondne&s;s prompt you, by extreme indulgence, to enervate the faculties of
<PB N="81" REF="027654_0187_0FD5691CF0C248D8">
her &s;oul, or pervert her di&s;po&s;ition, and by &s;o doing render her totally unfit to bear the many inconveniences and cro&s;&s;es &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily meet with in her pa&s;&s;age through life.</P>
<P>And on the contrary, do not, by an ill-judged &s;everity, drive her to mean &s;ubterfuges, fal&s;hoods and deceit, through fear of your anger.&mdash;Many an amiable girl has been totally ruined by &s;uch treatment; it leads them to fear but not love their parents, it prompts them to make companions of their &s;ervants, and often ends in the entire per|ver&s;ion of their principles.</P>
<P>Teach her to fear to di&s;oblige you, but let it be through fear of lo&s;ing your affection, not from the apprehen&s;ion of puni&s;hment. Do not be too anxious to have your child prai&s;ed for an early progre&s;s in her education; a young mind &s;hould not be loaded, it &s;poils the memory, and often occa&s;ions a di&s;like to &s;tudy in more advanced life, be&s;ides, children accu&s;tomed to hear them&s;elves commended are apt to think them&s;elves &s;ufficient|ly wife and accompli&s;hed before their education is well begun.</P>
<P>Do not encourage her in a love of finery, or &s;uffer her to be told &s;he is hand&s;ome, they will both be very pernicious to her future tranquil|lity.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="027654_0188_0FD5691E5FAFDCB8">
There is one thing which parents are very apt, not only to do them&s;elves, but to &s;uffer their &s;er|vants to do the &s;ame; that is, when any little ma&s;ter vi&s;its at the hou&s;e nearly of mi&s;s's age, &s;he is told that he is her little hu&s;band, and that &s;he mu&s;t hold up her head and behave like a woman, or &s;he will never be married,</P>
<P>Thus is the idea of love and lovers introduced into ther little hearts, before they are capable of under&s;tanding what the word means.</P>
<P>This is, to me, the mo&s;t fooli&s;h conduct in the world, and nothing would offend me &s;o &s;oon, as having &s;uch ridiculous things &s;aid to any child in who&s;e education and future pro&s;pects I was any ways concerned. Teach them the difference be|tween right and wrong, and convince their rea|&s;on, by pointing out the real way to promote their own happine&s;s, and merit the regard and e&s;teem of their friends.</P>
<P>Do not introduce your girl too early into pub|lic, it will give her a ta&s;te for di&s;&s;ipation: in proper time let her partake in moderation of all the amu&s;ements of the metropolis, &s;o as to pre|vent the bad effects of curio&s;ity ungratified; but at the &s;ame time accu&s;tom her to find re&s;ources within her&s;elf, that may, at all times, enable her to bani&s;h that mon&s;ter <HI>Ennui.</HI></P>

Tru&s;t not the cultivation of her mental fa|culties, or the forming of her moral character, to any one but your&s;elf; and as &s;he advances towards womanhood make her your friend and compa|nion: let the di&s;tance between mother and daugh|ter be forgot, and by treating her with a degree of confidence that flatters her &s;elf-con&s;equence, encourage her to make your bo&s;om the repo&s;itory of all her &s;ecrets, and be ready to apply to your better jugment to direct all her actions.</P>
<P>I am certain there would not be half the impru|dencies committed by girls in general, if they were not kept at &s;uch an awful di&s;tance by their mo|thers; that fearing either ridicule or reproof, they dare not entru&s;t them with their little plans and di&s;appointments, and relying either on the ad|vice of &s;ome one as inexperienced as them&s;elves, or to the &s;ugge&s;tions of their own &s;imple hearts, they involve them&s;elves in troubles, which en|danger their peace of mind and ruin their reputa|tion, but &s;o it will ever be while mothers forget they have ever been girls them&s;elves, and make no allowance for the volatility of youth, and the innocent impul&s;es of a heart unburthened by the cares of the world.</P>

beloved Gertrude, the nece&s;&s;ity there is of giving your child a proper &s;en&s;e of the high advantages of early piety, but this mu&s;t not be done by teach|ing her to &s;ay long prayers, of which &s;he cannot comprehend the meaning, or by making her read books of dull theology.</P>
<P>It is example, my dear friend, mu&s;t teach her the true principles of the Chri&s;tian Religion; let her &s;ee you in the act of devotion, let her curio|&s;ity be awakened, and then, as you an&s;wer her que&s;tions lead her by degrees to love, wor&s;hip and adore the Almighty giver of all good; convince her of her dependence on his bounty for food, raiment, and all the ble&s;&s;ings of life; teach her to place her whole confidence in his mercy, to re|ceive even the &s;malle&s;t ble&s;&s;ing with gratitude, and to bow under the heavie&s;t affliction with patience and humility.</P>
<P>But above all things, mind that your example does not contradict you precept. What confidence can a child place in the religion of its parent, when the parent lives in direct oppo&s;ition to the principles of that religion.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear friend, this is the one thing needful! this the heavenly comforter, that &s;up|ports us through life, and will cheer us in the hour of death!</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY ON FEMALE EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is much to be lamented, that in the pre&s;ent mode of educating females, the u&s;eful is entire|ly neglected, for the more ornamental and &s;uper|ficial accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>There was a time, when, if the daughter of a reputable trade&s;man could read and write good Engli&s;h, handle her needle with neatne&s;s and celerity, and under&s;tand both the theory and practice of good hou&s;ewifery, &s;he was thought perfectly accompli&s;hed, and &s;o indeed &s;he was as tho&s;e qalifications rendered her capable of un|dertaking the management of a family.</P>
<P>But in the pre&s;ent refined age, if an indu&s;trious trade&s;man can afford to give his daughter, five hundred pounds, it is immediately &s;ettled by Mamma, that Mi&s;s mu&s;t be <HI>genteelly</HI> educated</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he is at an early age &s;ent to a boar|ding-&s;chool, where &s;he learns to jabber bad French, and wor&s;e Engli&s;h; the old-fa&s;hion &s;am|pler, and u&s;eful plain-work are neglected, and &s;he is in&s;tructed how to work fillagree, make
<PB N="87" REF="027654_0193_0FD5692B3A6DF648">
wafer work, daub &s;attin, and work ill proportioned figures in cloth, which in due time are curiou&s;ly mounted, and hung round to ornament the par|lour of the fond but ill judging parents.</P>
<P>Add to the&s;e accompli&s;hments the very fa&s;hion|able one of jingling the keys of the harp&s;ichord, with great velocity, though perhaps out of time and out of tune.</P>
<P>Imagine Mi&s;s ju&s;t returned, at the age of &s;even|teen, her mind puffed up with vanity, and her head well &s;tored with &s;en&s;ibility, and all the delicate feelings to be gleaned from a circulating library, the contents of which &s;he has eagerly and indi&s;criminately peru&s;ed, without any one taking the pains to direct her judgment or correct her ta&s;te.</P>
<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e her lovely in her per&s;on, and attractive in her manners, &s;he comes home, and is idolized by her too partial mother, and &s;poken of by her father with pride and exultation; but alas! &s;he is too fine a lady to pay any attention to the dome&s;tic concerns of the family.</P>
<P>In this fooli&s;h idea &s;he is indulged by the mo|ther, who thinks her dear girl's beauty, &s;en&s;ibi|lity, and accompli&s;hments, will undoubtedly ob|tain her a match far &s;uperior to her pre&s;ent &s;tation,
<PB N="88" REF="027654_0194_0FD5692DAE4E3B98">
and &s;he will have no occa&s;ion to be a good hou&s;e|wife.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;anguine wi&s;hes are &s;eldom if ever realized, and we will &s;uppo&s;e her married to a man who is ju&s;t entered into a genteel and impro|ving line of bu&s;ine&s;s; her friends think it a good match, her fortune is an acqui&s;ition to her hu&s;band and they enter the career of life with all the hopes of permanent happine&s;s which peace plenty can in&s;pire.</P>
<P>But what a wretched figure does this elegant accompli&s;hed girl make, as mi&s;tre&s;s of a family; her &s;ervants cheat and laugh at her, her acquaint|ance blame her, and perhaps &s;he may incur even the cen&s;ure of her hu&s;band, for paying no more attention to matters which &s;o nearly concern his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Has &s;he children, &s;he knows not how to make or mend their clothes, &s;he is always &s;urrounded with difficulties, from which &s;he knows not how to extricate her&s;elf, and a&s;hamed to confe&s;s her ignorance to any one who could in&s;truct her in the point &s;he requires, &s;he becomes peevi&s;h and di&s;|&s;ati&s;fied, neglects even tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which &s;he formerly &s;trove &s;o hard to attain; be|comes negligent in her dre&s;s, carele&s;s in her man|ners, and &s;inks into a very blank in the crea|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="027654_0195_0FD5244A371BA698">
Her hu&s;band di&s;appointed in not &s;eeing that order and regularity at home which he had once fondly hoped, no longer finds any charms in her &s;ociety, and &s;eeks to forget his di&s;appointment either in the bottle, or at the gaming table, both equally de&s;tructive; and &s;he fees inevitable ruin approaching, without the &s;malle&s;t power to ward off the blow.</P>
<P>Nor can the whole univer&s;e pre&s;ent us with an object more truly de&s;erving our pity, than &s;uch a woman in a &s;tate of penury! She is at a lo&s;s how to perform even the nece&s;&s;ary duties of life, &s;he cannot exert her&s;elf to obtain even a &s;ingle meal for her&s;elf or children; &s;he pines in ob|&s;curity, regretting her u&s;ele&s;s education, and wi&s;h|es that the &s;ums &s;o expended, had been laid by to encrea&s;e her fortune, and &s;he her&s;elf had been only in&s;tructed in tho&s;e things, which would have tended ultimately to render her a u&s;eful and re|&s;pectable member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But how widely different is the lot of the happy girl, who&s;e parents have, not only by precept but example, implanted in her mind the great nece&s;&s;ity of rendering her&s;elf u&s;eful, before &s;he can be e&s;teemed valuable&mdash;who perfectly un|der&s;tands how to manage her family, and regu|late her &s;ervants&mdash;who to affability and chearful|ne&s;s, and indu&s;try, oeconomy and piety.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="027654_0196_0FD5693050208E28">
Such a woman when &s;he marries, however &s;mall her fortune, brings to her hu&s;band an inex|hau&s;tible fund of trea&s;ure. She is not a&s;hamed to inve&s;tigate even the minute&s;t concerns of her fa|mily; her expences are regulated by the &s;tricte&s;t rules of frugality void of par&s;imony, with one hand &s;he &s;ecures her hu&s;band's intere&s;t, and with the other di&s;pen&s;es to the &s;ons and daughters of poverty, the overplus of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which her own prudence has helped to &s;ecure to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She is always &s;trictly neat in her apparel, but entirely free from &s;hew or finery; her whole family is regular, uniform and decent, her &s;er|vants re&s;pect her, her hu&s;band idolizes her, and her children look up to her as their friend and benefactre&s;s, from who&s;e bright example they may learn the road to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Should even mi&s;fortune overtake her, &s;he is &s;till chearful, &s;till unembarra&s;&s;ed, without a murmur &s;he conde&s;cends to perform even the meane&s;t offi|ces for her&s;elf, her hu&s;band, and children; &s;he exerts her utmo&s;t abilities to retrieve the pro&s;perity they had unfortunately lo&s;t, &s;he &s;hares her hu&s;|bands care, and alleviates his concern&mdash;and &s;hould their hone&s;t efforts to regain their former &s;tate of affluence fail, &s;he &s;ets down perfectly hap|py in the reflection that &s;he had di&s;charged, to
<PB N="91" REF="027654_0197_0FD56931EB928A80">
the utmo&s;t of her power, the duties of that &s;tation, in which it plea&s;ed Heaven to place her.</P>
<P>Yet, think not I mean entirely to &s;et a&s;ide tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, which when kept under proper regulations, certainly tend to make the female character more irre&s;i&s;tibly charming.</P>
<P>There are a certain cla&s;s of women to whom the&s;e accompli&s;hments are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to their filling their re&s;pective characters with pro|priety.</P>
<P>A woman of independent fortune may with &s;afety indulge her ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, drawing, &amp;c. but, in the name of common &s;en&s;e, what has a girl to do with the fine arts, who, perhaps, after &s;he leaves &s;chool, has neither time or opportunity to pur&s;ue tho&s;e &s;tudies, unle&s;s by &s;o doing, &s;he neglects &s;ome more u&s;eful employment.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that it is not impo&s;&s;ible for the u&s;eful and ornamental branches of education to be combined; nay, that it is even natural for a wo|man of &s;en&s;e and di&s;cretion to endeavour to blend them in &s;uch a manner, as to render them only as &s;oils to each other, and the woman who &s;tudies to unite in her&s;elf, the attentive hou&s;ewife, the good mother, affectionate wife, well-informed companion, and accompli&s;hed woman, is certain|ly
<PB N="92" REF="027654_0198_0FD5693445558638">
a character de&s;erving e&s;teem and veneration, we look upon her almo&s;t as a being of a &s;uperior order, and &s;he is at once beloved, admired and re&s;pected by both &s;exes.</P>
<P>As &s;o much of the happine&s;s of mankind de|pends on the females connected in their families, I have expatiated on the nece&s;&s;ity of young wo|men being brought up in the practice of every dome&s;tic virtue, more largely than I at fir&s;t inten|ded &s;ince not only the ri&s;ing generation, but ages yet unborn &s;hall venerate or execrate our memories, according to the advice and example we give our children.</P>
<P>If the daughters of the pre&s;ent age are &s;uffered to remain totally ignorant of the dome&s;tic regula|tions nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in every family, what are we to expect in the next generation, but that the ruin which has already begun to &s;hew it&s;elf in our mo&s;t capital cities, will &s;pread it&s;elf all over the kingdom, and &s;ink it at la&s;t in one univer&s;al &s;tate of bankruptcy.</P>
<P>More, much more than we &s;hould at fir&s;t be led to imagine, depends on the education of the female world. What ruin, what inevitable de&s;o|lation may not an idle di&s;&s;ipated woman bring on tho&s;e who may unfortunately be attached to her per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="027654_0199_0FD56935C0029428">
And on the contrary, how does a &s;en&s;ible, virtuous, well-informed female, exalt and ennoble the thoughts of all who conver&s;e with her.</P>
<P>Were every parent of my opinion they would fir&s;t, by example, plant the &s;eeds of genuine worth in the brea&s;t of their daughters, and by the tendere&s;t care and milde&s;t precept, cultivate each budding virtue, 'till they blo&s;&s;omed in full per|fection, then ornamenting them with the elegant accompli&s;hments nece&s;&s;ary to complete the female character, render them at once the pride and glory of their country.</P>

<HEAD>URGANDA AND FATIMA, AN EASTERN TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of the mo&s;t beautiful vallies that lies up|on the borders of the Ea&s;t lived Zegdad, an in|offen&s;ive &s;hepherd. He had but one child, and ha|ving been early deprived of his wife, he lavi&s;hed his whole &s;tock of tenderne&s;s of Fatima.</P>
<P>Though fortune had not been lavi&s;h of her gifts to the father of Fatima, yet he wanted not the ne|ce&s;&s;aries or comforts of life&mdash;his cottage was clean, and furni&s;hed with every thing u&s;eful; his fields &s;upplied them with food; his flock with raiment.</P>
<P>Fatima was coar&s;e in her per&s;on, but &s;he was chearfull and good-natured&mdash;&s;he ro&s;e each morn with the feathered &s;ong&s;ters, and chearfully per|formed the duties of her &s;tation; her whole &s;tudy was to plea&s;e her father, and a &s;mile from Zeg|dad was at any time, ample recompence for the &s;evere&s;t fatigue, and like a cordial &s;erved to revive her drooping &s;pirits. She would a&s;&s;i&s;t, una&s;ked, in the mo&s;t laborious employments, and when the labour of the day was pa&s;t, &s;he would lightly
<PB N="95" REF="027654_0201_0FD569395BCCA748">
trip over the green turf, with her young compani|ons, while her father played on the flagelet. The mind of Fatima was calm as the delights of Para|di&s;e.</P>
<P>One day her father &s;ent her to the grand Vizi|er's, with fruit for his favorite&mdash;&s;he was conducted by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful Semira was repo&s;ing on a bed of ro&s;es, clad in all the pomp of ea&s;tern magnificence, while two &s;laves were fanning her to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Fatima had never before &s;een aught but &s;impli|city&mdash;&s;he was filled with wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;urpri&s;ing beauty and grandeur of Semira, and as &s;he gazed, envy and di&s;content crept into her hitherto guilele&s;s heart.</P>
<P>She returned home with a mind totally altered to what it was. Her rural pa&s;times no more de|ligted her&mdash;labour was now a trouble&mdash;&s;he had been a witne&s;s to the ea&s;e and indolence of Semira. If at any time &s;he caught a glimp&s;e of her per&s;on in the &s;tream, &s;he turned from it with di&s;gu&s;t. Her days were joyle&s;s, and her nights &s;pent in bewai|ling her unhappy lot.</P>
<P>One evening, deaf to the &s;olicitations of her young companions, &s;he retired to a thick grove,
<PB N="96" REF="027654_0202_0FD5693AC8C992A0">
and inattentive to the &s;ound of the flagelet, thus gave vent to her &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Oh! wretched Fatima, unhappy maid! Why was I born to know &s;o hard a fate&mdash;to eat the bread of labour, to &s;leep upon a ru&s;hy couch, while Semira is &s;urrounded with &s;plendor, is &s;erved by kneeling &s;laves, and &s;leeps on a bed of down! Why has nature denied me tho&s;e ravi&s;hing beau|ties, it has &s;o bountifully lavi&s;hed on her, her eyes are bright as the &s;tars, her lips like half blown ro&s;es, her hand and arm like poli&s;hed ivory. Oh! why was I not lovely as Semira, and favo|rite to the grand Vizier&mdash;in this low abject &s;tate my being is intolerable, I will no longer endure it but in but in yon limpid &s;tream lo&s;e the remembrance of my&s;elf and Semira.</P>
<P>At this moment the Fairy Urganda &s;tood before her.</P>
<P>"Thy complaints are ju&s;t, Oh! Fatima (&s;aid &s;he) and if thou wilt relinqui&s;h thy home, and for&s;ake thy father, thou &s;halt enjoy the utmo&s;t extent of thy wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>Fatima eagerly complied with the offered terms and the Fairy immediately &s;prinkled her with wat|er at the &s;ame time pronouncing &s;ome my&s;tic words,
<PB N="97" REF="027654_0203_0FD5693DCB584048">
when &s;he was transformed into a virgin of tran|&s;cendent beauty, and found her&s;elf in the garden of a palace belonging to the grand Vizier.</P>
<P>The lovely Semira had the day before offended her Lord, and was no longer a favorite. Fatima attracted the notice of the Vizier&mdash;he ordered her to be led into &s;plendid apartments, clothed with co&s;tly robes, adorned with jewels, and appointed &s;laves to wait on her, and comply with all-her wi&s;hes&mdash;and Fatima &s;upplied the place of the de|graded Semira.</P>
<P>She now thought her&s;elf the happie&s;t among the happy; but the Vizier was pa&s;&s;ionate, capri|cious, jealous, and extremely cruel, and it was not long before the di&s;appointed Fatima di&s;covered that to be favorite to the grand Vizier, was to live only in &s;plendid &s;lavery.</P>
<P>"But though (&s;aid &s;he often to her&s;elf) though the grand Vizier's favorite is mi&s;erable, how &s;uperlatively happy mu&s;t be the favorite Sultana of my Lord the Emperor! Oh! could I but attain that envied &s;tation, how &s;oon &s;hould the imperious Vizier &s;uffer for his barbarity to me."</P>
<P>Again did the bo&s;om of Fatima &s;uffer all the mi&s;eries of di&s;content&mdash;the vaulted roofs, &s;paci|ous gardens, and rich pre&s;ents of the Vizier, no

longer charmed her. She &s;ighed for the en&s;igns of royalty, and her pillow was nightly bedewed with her tears.</P>
<P>One evening &s;he retired to an arbour, at the ex|tremity of the garden, and throwing her&s;elf on the hanks where &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een Semira, thus poured forth her complaints.</P>
<P>"How wretched is the fate of Fatima&mdash; condemned to drag a hated being with a man who &s;tudies only his own gratification, and expects me to be the &s;lave of his caprice and pa&s;&s;ion. Oh! could I but get from this dete&s;ted place, I would fly to my Lord the Emperor, and bow my&s;elf low in the du&s;t before him. My charms might captivate his royal heart, and I might reign the Empre&s;s of the Ea&s;t."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke the&s;e words, a &s;udden light enter|ed the arbour, and the Fairy Urganda again &s;tood before her.</P>
<P>"Beautiful Fatima, &s;aid &s;he, forbear your com|plaints, the prophet permits you to enjoy your wi&s;h, then ri&s;e and follow me."</P>
<P>The Fairy led her to the Emperor's palace, and placed her among a number of beautiful &s;laves,
<PB N="99" REF="027654_0205_0FD5694188984588">
from among which the Emperor was next morn|ing to chu&s;e a favorite.</P>
<P>In the morning the Emperor pa&s;&s;ed through the apartment, and his choice fell on Fatima. She was cloathed in the en&s;igns of royalty, led in &s;tate to the mo&s;que, and in a few hours heard her|&s;elf proclaimed Empre&s;s of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>But Fatima had, to the idea of royalty, annex|ed the ideas of youth and beauty, how &s;urpri&s;ed was &s;he then to find the Emperor, old, ugly, and deformed in his per&s;on, moro&s;e in his di&s;po&s;ition, and jealous in the extreme&mdash;&s;he &s;hrunk from his embraces with horror, and contracted &s;o &s;et|tled an aver&s;ion to him, that not all the &s;plendor that awaited her could in the &s;malle&s;t degree com|pen&s;ate for the many tedious hours &s;he was obliged to devote to him.</P>
<P>Among the &s;laves that attended on Fatima, was the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Zynina, who had long, with envious eyes, beheld the love of the Emperor be&s;towed on others, and only watched an opportunity to ingra|tiate her&s;elf in his favor, by rendering him &s;ome piece of &s;ervice. To this end &s;he cultivated the friend&s;hip of the new Queen, and by degrees drew from her the rea&s;on of her tears and dejec|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="027654_0206_0FD5695C8C66DDA0">
This intelligence was in&s;tantly conveyed to the Emperor, with the addition of Fatima's heart be|ing dedicated to another. O&s;min willing to be convinced of the truth of Zynina's declaration, de&s;ired to be concealed in an apartment adjoining the Queen's, where he might ea&s;ily overhear any thing that pa&s;&s;ed between her and the deceitful &s;lave, who immediately returned to her mi&s;tre&s;s, and artfully renewed the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Fatima, glad to unburthen her almo&s;t bur&s;ting heart, confe&s;&s;ed her &s;ettled aver&s;ion to her Lord, and that death it&s;elf would be preferable to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation. "Then death be thy portion," cried the enraged Emperor, furiou&s;ly ru&s;hing into the apartment, and lifting his glittering &s;cimitar.</P>
<P>Fatima fell upon her knees, and, in an agony of terror exclaimed, "O that I was an humble cot|tager, and had never known the pangs that wait on greatne&s;s."</P>
<P>At that moment &s;he found her&s;elf clad in her former homely apparel, &s;tanding at the door of her father's cottage, when the Fairy appeared and thus addre&s;&s;ed her.</P>

<P>Methinks, when I look round the world, I am ready to hail each member of &s;ociety as my brother or &s;i&s;ter, I rejoice in their &s;ucce&s;s, acknowledge their merit, admire their beauty, lament their misfortunes, and &s;hed the tear of &s;incere compa&s;&s;i|on over their vices.

The man who lives only for him&s;elf, is, in my opinion, a mon&s;ter of ingratitude; his life is one continued blank, except marked by &s;ome act of inhumanity. If we mu&s;t reckon that day lo&s;t in which we perform no good action, what mu&s;t we think of a life pa&s;&s;ed in a continued &s;eries of &s;tupid inattention to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es or injuries of our fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Hail! heaven-born charity! bright re&s;plen|dent virtue; who&s;e dazzling rays hide from the accu&s;ing angel multitudes of offences, ble&s;&s;ed is the heart thou do&s;t inhabit, happy is the man who&s;e actions are guided by thee.</P>
<P>By charity I do not mean the merely &s;haring with tho&s;e that need the &s;uperabundant gifts of fortune, though 'tis certainly our duty to allevi|ate the misfortunes of others, yet by &s;o doing we do not fully di&s;charge the duties of chri&s;tianity. Charity is that benevolence of heart, that meek|ne&s;s of &s;pirit, which leads us to judge favorably of the actions of others, never to propagate a &s;tory to the injury of a neighbour's character, but to &s;tand forward the champion of innocence, and to defend tho&s;e, whom envy, malice, or revenge, have a&s;per&s;ed. Con&s;cious of its own rectitude, &s;u&s;pects not the integrity of another; ever ready to pour the balm of con&s;olation into the heart wounded by &s;orrow; envies no per&s;on's &s;uperior

<P>Yet there are people in the world who&s;e chief plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ts in villifying and a&s;per&s;ing the characters even of their be&s;t friends, and &s;orry I am to &s;ay, tho&s;e characters are too frequently found among the fair &s;ex. Would they but con&s;i|der that while depre&s;&s;ing the merits of another, they do not increa&s;e their own, but rather attract notice, and lead their acquaintance narrowly to &s;crutinize the conduct of a woman, who is &s;o &s;e|vere upon their errors, it would certainly, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;top the unbounded licence they give their tongues.</P>
<P>I do not know a more hateful character than He|cati&s;&s;a, &s;he has indulged this evil propen&s;ity 'till it has become a part of her nature, and &s;he could no more entertain you for a few hours without a tale of &s;candal than &s;he could walk over the gla&s;&s;y &s;ur|face of the ocean. Many is the feeling heart &s;he has wounded, many a breach of friend&s;hip has taken its ri&s;e from her malevolent tongue, &s;he cares not how dear the ties &s;he endeavours to break, &s;he will &s;ow di&s;&s;ention between father and child, brother and &s;i&s;ter hu&s;band and wife, and

<P>She was, when very young, by the treachery of a near relation, thrown into a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;itua|tion, from which the bounty and genero&s;ity of a widow lady relieved her; not &s;atisfied with merely admini&s;tering to her pre&s;ent wants, &s;he took her into her family, and made her companion to her daughter.</P>
<P>The innocent Anna conceived a &s;incere friend|&s;hip for her, and for many years they lived like &s;i&s;ters; innumerable were the favours heaped on Hecati&s;&s;a, who remained with the family; till a worthy man, attracted by her per&s;on and &s;pecious manner, made honorable propo&s;als and married her.</P>
<P>Hecati&s;&s;a might now have been the happie&s;t woman breathing&mdash;her hu&s;band was generous, humane, friendly, and good-natured to exce&s;s. He pre&s;ented her to his family, who received her cordially, and the poor ea&s;y good man thought he had in&s;ured his own felicity, but Hecati&s;&s;a &s;oon &s;hone forth in her own proper character.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="027654_0211_0FD5694A8B38D168">
She planted di&s;&s;ention in her hu&s;band's family, a&s;&s;umed an unbecoming authority over all his actions, and by her artful a&s;cendancy contracted his heart, and made him treat with di&s;re&s;pect the very family who had &s;heltered her unprotected youth! Her vile in&s;inuations were aimed at the character of Anna, nor was &s;he the only object of her malice; every woman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;u|perior endowments of per&s;on or mind, was to her a fit &s;ubject for &s;lander. She wi&s;hed no per&s;on to be more fortunate or happy than her&s;elf, &s;he li&s;|tened to every malicious tale with avidity, repeated them with plea&s;ure, and aggravated every circum|&s;tance which had the lea&s;t appearance of vice or fol|ly. She would &s;toop to &s;uch meanne&s;s, that rather than not compa&s;s a favorite point, &s;he would tam|per with &s;ervants, to obtain the &s;ecrets of a family.</P>
<P>She was once on a vi&s;it at the hou&s;e of Serena, &s;he found her beloved by her &s;ervants, re&s;pected by her friends, and tenderly e&s;teemed by her hu&s;|band. Vexed to &s;ee how &s;uperior &s;he was in every re&s;pect to her&s;elf, &s;he eagerly watched for &s;ome opportunity to le&s;&s;en her merit. She wre&s;ted the mo&s;t innocent and even laudable actions into guilt, &s;he poi&s;oned the minds of her &s;ervants, and tradu|ced her reputation a&s;&s;uming the appearance of hu|mility and virtue, &s;he endeavoured to throw on Serena the odium of every vice which deformed her own character.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="027654_0212_0FD5694DAF369BE0">
But Serena was not long inveloped in the cloud Hecati&s;&s;a had &s;pread over her; &s;he continued in the regular di&s;charge of the duties of her &s;tation, paid no regard to the malicious &s;landers &s;he daily heard, but, pitying the woman who could &s;o far forget truth and ju&s;tice as to blacken the character of one &s;he profe&s;&s;ed a friend&s;hip for, treated her with the &s;ilent contempt her conduct merited.</P>
<P>No &s;en&s;ible per&s;on will &s;cruple to affirm that He|cati&s;&s;a is mi&s;erable. Hated and de&s;pi&s;ed by all her acquaintance, her &s;ociety is &s;hunned like the pe&s;ti|lence; and though by her con&s;ummate art &s;he &s;till impo&s;es upon her hu&s;band, and retains his affecti|on, her di&s;content and ill-nature prevent her reap|ing any plea&s;ure in his company; &s;he is jealous, peevi&s;h and unea&s;y; in &s;hort &s;he has &s;uch a legion of torments in her own bo&s;om, that &s;he often applies to a comforting cordial to rai&s;e her depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits.</P>
<P>However de&s;picable the character of Hecati&s;&s;a may appear that of Prudelia is equally &s;o. Prudelia is a woman who pays the nice&s;t regard to propriety and decorum, &s;he is ever prying into her neigh|bour's conduct, and if their actions do not exactly agree with her &s;crupulous notions of rectitude, &s;he he&s;itates not to conclude them abandoned and lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of virtue.</P>

Albert and Julia had been married near four years, during which time they had lived in mutual love and confidence, when their ill-fortune took them to live in the &s;ame &s;treet with Prudelia. Al|bert followed the &s;ea, of con&s;equence Julia was of|ten left for months together the guardian of her ho|nor, the mi&s;tre&s;s of her own actions. She was lively in her di&s;po&s;ition, but her heart was the &s;eat of pure innocence.</P>
<P>Albert was gone his accu&s;tomed voyage, when Prudelia undertook to &s;crutinize the conduct of Julia.</P>
<P>Prudelia had vi&s;ited her, &s;he had been a witne&s;s to the innocent gaiety of her temper, &s;he had even pretended to admire her vivacity and good-humor, but &s;he whi&s;pered among her friends, that &s;he thought it was highly improper for a young wo|man like her, who&s;e hu&s;band was from home, to receive &s;o much company, or be &s;o frequent in her vi&s;its abroad. She watched every movement of Juli|a, was informed of all her vi&s;itors names, knew what time they came and went and even what hours &s;he retired to re&s;t and aro&s;e.</P>
<P>Julia was a woman of nice feelings, &s;he was tena|cious of honor; and the bare idea of that honor be|ing &s;u&s;pected was extremely painful to her. She was unea&s;y at the watchful eye Prudelia kept upon her
<PB N="108" REF="027654_0214_0FD5695088866F20">
actions, not that &s;he feared to have them &s;rcutinized, but becau&s;e &s;he did not think her&s;elf obliged to be accountable for her conduct to any per&s;on but her hu&s;band. She therefore grew di&s;tant and re&s;erved, and whenever Prudelia called on her, gave little or no an&s;wer to her many artful que&s;tions concer|ning where &s;he had been, or how &s;he had &s;pent her time.</P>
<P>About this time a brother of Julia's failed in bu|&s;ine&s;s, he retired to a hou&s;e in the environs of We&s;t|min&s;ter, to avoid the importunity of his creditors.</P>
<P>Julia was tenderly attached to her brother, &s;he exerted every power to &s;erve his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family, and even parted with her plate, and &s;ome other valuables, to rai&s;e money to &s;upply the pre&s;ent exigence.</P>
<P>The attorney who had the care of &s;ettling her brother's affairs, was frequently with her for an hour or two together, and often &s;he went away with him in a coach, and was ab&s;ent for &s;everal days, as the bu&s;ine&s;s which employed &s;o large a &s;hare of her time, required &s;ecre&s;y, &s;he never mentioned it to Prudelia nor did &s;he when going out ever tell the &s;ervant where &s;he was to be found.</P>
<P>One morning the attorney had breakfa&s;ted with her and &s;he was gone with him to her brother,
<PB N="109" REF="027654_0215_0FD56953A98E6D80">
when Albert unexpectedly returned. The &s;ervant could give no account where her mi&s;tre&s;s was, and Prudelia who had &s;een him return, came over to invite him to dine with her family.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry my Julia is from home, &s;aid he, but there was no po&s;&s;ibility of her thinking to &s;ee me to day, as I am returned at lea&s;t &s;ix weeks before the time appointed.</P>
<P>Why yes, replied Prudelia, with a &s;ignificant look, I fancy you will be a very unexpected gue&s;t.</P>
<P>It will be an agreeable &s;urprize though, &s;aid Albert.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;o, &s;aid, Prudelia &s;miling, contempt|uou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The &s;mile, the &s;ignificant look, alarmed Albert, have you any rea&s;on to think otherways, madam, &s;aid he? Surely Julia will be plea&s;ed with my return.</P>
<P>Oh! mo&s;t certainly &s;he will, replied &s;he, &s;miling again; but, no doubt, &s;he would have liked a little more warning of your arrival.</P>
<P>By heavens, madam, &s;aid Albert, your words di&s;tre&s;s me beyond mea&s;ure, you cannot mean to glance an a&s;per&s;ion at the character of Julia, and
<PB N="110" REF="027654_0216_0FD56955569090C8">
yet what other motive can you have for tho&s;e con|temptuous &s;miles. Tell me, dear madam, the mean|ing of the&s;e ambiguous looks; but hold, if it is any thing to Julia's di&s;advantage I &s;hall not be|lieve it though uttered by an angel.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, (&s;aid Prudelia, a&s;&s;uming a &s;erious countenance, in which was blended a mixture of pity and anger) far be it from me to injure the reputation of any woman, or ever interfere between man and wife, you are united for life, and 'tis therefore your duty to bear with each others foi|bles, as well as you can.</P>
<P>My Julia has no foibles, replied Albert, or it &s;he has I never di&s;covered them.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to &s;ay &s;he has, my good friend, but I wi&s;h &s;he would come home.</P>
<P>Albert joined the wi&s;h, and the day pa&s;&s;ed on without much farther conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>As the evening advanced he grew unea&s;y, and when the clock &s;truck ten, he exclaimed impati|ently, where can &s;he be?</P>
<P>Patience, my good Sir, &s;aid the artful Pru|delia, you may not perhaps &s;ee her the&s;e two or three hours.</P>
<P>Julia was not u&s;ed to keep &s;uch late hours, &s;aid he pen&s;ively.</P>

<P>This was the favourable moment for the vile in|cendiary&mdash;&s;he prefaced her &s;candalous tale, with the &s;orrow &s;he felt at being obliged to give his worthy heart &s;o much pain, &s;aid, had Julia re|turned in any tolerable time, &s;he would have kept the affair to her&s;elf, but as &s;he found he already began to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething was ami&s;s, &s;he thought it was be&s;t he &s;hould be informed of the whole, that he might take his mea&s;ures accordingly.</P>
<P>She then informed him, that during his ab&s;cence Julia's extravagance had known no bounds&mdash;that &s;he had paid no regard to her reputation&mdash;re|ceived the con&s;tant vi&s;its of one particular gentle|man, and made frequent excur&s;ions into the coun|try with him, where &s;he &s;taid for &s;everal days, that to &s;upply her extravagance and that of her para|mour, &s;he had parted with her watch, plate, and o|ther valuables, and concluded with &s;aying, her heart bled to think &s;o worthy a man &s;hould be uni|ted to a woman who knew &s;o little how to value her good fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="027654_0218_0FD56958087A9BC8">
Albert li&s;tened with every mark of horror and a&s;toni&s;hment, at length (&s;tarting from his &s;eat and &s;tamping his foot with vehemence) he cried, 'tis every &s;yllable as fal&s;e as hell, my Julia can never have betrayed the honor I tru&s;ted to her care, or abu&s;ed the confidence I repo&s;ed in her.</P>
<P>'Tis well, Sir, replied Prudelia, with a look of offended pride, you doubt my veracity, how|ever you will find the whole neighbourhood are acquainted with her errors, as well as I am&punc; nay call your own &s;ervant, &s;he can a&s;&s;ert the truth of what I &s;ay.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant was called, &s;he confirmed the infa|mous tale, and Albert vowed to be revenged on his innocent wife.</P>
<P>Prudelia had judged rightly, Julia did not re|turn that night, and though Albert went home, and retired to his apartment, he never attempted to lye down, but traver&s;ed the room in the utmo&s;t agitation of &s;pirits during the whole night.</P>
<P>In the mean time Julia was enjoying, with her brother's family, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction. His failure was occa&s;ioned by remittances arri|ving in proper time for him to make good &s;ome obligations he had entered into, the money Julia had rai&s;ed for him, had prevented immediate

bankruptcy, and that day &s;everal &s;hips had arri|ved with remittances, which would again enable him to appear among his friends with credit.</P>
<P>The whole family were together at his lodgings, and a &s;mile of tranquillity &s;at on every counte|nance.&mdash;How very happy I &s;hould be, &s;aid Julia, looking round her, if my Albert was joined in this loved company, I &s;hould then, at one view, behold all that is mo&s;t dear to me on earth.</P>
<P>When &s;upper was over, the evening was far advanced, Julia propo&s;ed &s;taying with them all night, and walking home in the cool of the mor|ning.</P>
<P>She retired to re&s;t with a heart lightened of its cares, offered up a prayer for her Albert's &s;afe|ty, and &s;unk into an undi&s;turbed &s;lumber, little thinking the mi&s;eries that awaited her in the mor|ning.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock &s;he aro&s;e, and ki&s;&s;ing her little &s;leeping niece, who had been her bed-fellow, &s;tole &s;oftly down &s;tairs, and walked lei&s;urely to|wards home, enjoying the fre&s;hne&s;s of the morn|ing, as &s;he walked thro' the park, and contem|plating on the happy change in her brother's af|fairs.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="027654_0220_0FD5244BDA22B068">
It was near eight o'clock when &s;he arrived at her own door. My ma&s;ter is come home, ma|dam, &s;aid the maid, as &s;he opened it.</P>

<P>Albert had never &s;een his Julia weep before, but his heart wept with her, but he now took her &s;urprize for a token of guilt, and imputed her tears to the effects of art. He therefore regarded them not, but walked about the room in &s;ullen &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Oh! heavens, &s;aid Julia, what have I done to de&s;erve this; tell me, Albert, how have I forfeit|ed your affection?</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="027654_0221_0FD5695EEAAD2BC0">
By betraying my honor, &s;aid he fiercely, by becoming an abandoned wanton.</P>
<P>Heaven is my witne&s;s, I have done neither, &s;aid &s;he, &s;inknig on her knees, Oh! Albert, kill me in&s;tantly, but do not &s;u&s;pect my fidelity. I will ble&s;s you with my la&s;t breath, and dying, de|clare, I never entertained even a thought to the prejudice of your honor, or the purity of the af|fection I bear to you.</P>
<P>Cur&s;ed di&s;&s;embler, &s;aid the enraged Albert, and he &s;purned her from him with his foot. She &s;hrieked and fell, her head &s;truck the bed-po&s;t, and the blood gu&s;hed in a torrent from her fore|head.</P>
<P>Merciful heaven, cried he, I have murdered her. He caught her from the ground, but found neither &s;en&s;e nor breath remained. Frantic, he rang the bell for a &s;ervant, and &s;ent for imme|diate a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>A &s;urgeon examined her head, the &s;kull was fractured. After the wound was dre&s;&s;ed &s;he open|ed her eyes, and fixed them upon her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Albert, &s;aid &s;he, I know not who has poi&s;on|ed your mind, or how you could &s;u&s;pect the fide|lity of Julia. Believe me, I am innocent, in my

cabinet you will find papers, that will unravel any &s;eeming my&s;tery in my late conduct. I die, but dying ble&s;s you, for all your kindne&s;s to me. Ah! my love, 'tis not the wound I received on my head, but that which you inflicted on my heart, that terminates my exi&s;tence! I loved you too well, Albert, to feel the privation of your affecti|on and live; my heart unprepared to meet your unkindne&s;s &s;unk under it, &s;truggled and broke.</P>
<P>She attempted to throw her arms round his neck, but nature was exhau&s;ted; &s;he could only &s;ay, Oh! ble&s;s him heaven&mdash;and her &s;pirit took its flight to the regions of eternal day.</P>
<P>Albert's di&s;tre&s;s was too great for de&s;cription, when he &s;ound he had by his blind pa&s;&s;ion, termi|nated the exi&s;tence of an innocent, valuable wo|man, whom he loved with the mo&s;t fervent affecti|on. A deep melancholy &s;eized him, nor could all the attentions of his friends rou&s;e him from the torpid &s;tupor he had &s;unk into, he grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and ended his days in a mad-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As there are too many Prudelia's in the world, we cannot be too cautious how we believe a male|volent a&s;&s;ertion, or give way to &s;u&s;picion and jea|lou&s;y.</P>
