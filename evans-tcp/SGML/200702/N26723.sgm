<HEAD>THE GLEBE HOUSE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN a beautiful vale, watered by a winding river, in D&mdash;&s;hire, was &s;ituated the Glebe Hou&s;e of Mr. Owens, who convinced of the truth and efficacy of tho&s;e doc|trines it was his duty to in&s;til, ever delivered them with that awful|ne&s;s and energy, calculated to catch the mo&s;t wandering idea, and &s;often the heart, if not thoroughly hardened in the &s;chool of depravi|ty.</P>

would have adorned the mo&s;t ex|alted &s;tation, while his &s;implicity and content appeared as if none other than his pre&s;ent humble one would have &s;uited him half &s;o well.</P>
<P>Moderate as was his income, he &s;till re&s;erved &s;ome trifle for the children of affliction&mdash;&s;atisfied, that a &s;mall gift from the hand of real charity, would obtain the ble&s;|&s;ing of Providence. He knew not the vanities of life, and thought with Gold&s;mith,</P>
<L>"Man wants but little here below,</L>
<L>"Nor wants that little long."</L>
<P>His wife with equal &s;implicity, had a much larger portion of vani|ty&mdash;nor could any argument to the contrary per&s;uade her but that more happine&s;s mu&s;t be enjoyed in a coach and &s;ix, than without

one. She yet remembered with pride, her maiden name of pretty Fan of the Glade, but was fonder, if po&s;&s;ible, of di&s;playing her daugh|ter's perfections than her own; &s;he was, to allow her all her merits, an excellent hou&s;e-wife, was rec|koned the greate&s;t adept in the country at <HI>Pope-Joan,</HI> and had in|troduced &s;everal improving ingre|dients in mixing particular pud|dings.</P>
<P>Her &s;weet little boy, Ja&s;per as &s;he called him, was now clearly &s;ix feet high, and in his one and twentieth year&mdash;the tints of the lilly, once con&s;picuous on his face, had long been u&s;urped by a brown hue, enlivened with the brighte&s;t bloom of health; his hair of the darke&s;t che&s;nut, luxuriantly thick,

hung carele&s;sly round his neck and forehead, while the fire of his large hazel eyes might have been played off with dangerous &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t hearts boa&s;ting of peculiar frigidne&s;s.</P>
<P>But except a little ru&s;tic gallant|ry with the wood nymphs, poor Ja&s;per had confined his admiration to ladies who had flouri&s;hed centu|ries back, &s;uch as Hebe, Cleopa|tra, Lucretia, &amp;c. His father had really almo&s;t made him a pe|dant.&mdash;With &s;uch abilities 'twas &s;urely hoped he would e&s;tabli&s;h his family in pro&s;perity.</P>

<P>With an artle&s;s negligence, her light brown hair flowed down her back, and had the trees, (as we are told was once the ca&s;e,) been occupied by Dryads, tho&s;e about the Glebe might have regretted

<P>The Glebe-hou&s;e was a rough old &s;tructure&mdash;the ivy crept over one wing entirely and over the door was a beautiful canopy, of honey &s;uckles; the lawn on which it &s;tood was hedged round with evergreens and planted with elms, and the waving poplar; the garden was laid out more for u&s;e than &s;how, yet it was not unplea|&s;ing, nor had a &s;hady &s;eat for re|creation

She fulfilled her promi&s;e of a legacy, by a be|que&s;t of two hundred pounds to Mrs. Owens.</P>
<P>That good woman &s;hed a flood of tears when &s;he heard the fir&s;t account of the death, but &s;oon moderated her grief by quoting an old &s;aying of her hu&s;band's&mdash; "we are all mortal, and mu&s;t die &s;ooner or later;" in &s;hort, &s;he ne|ver re&s;ted until &s;he put on her

<P>Mrs. Crofts was a lady who had retired to the country to lye-in about &s;ix months after the death of her lamented &s;pou&s;e; finding the people very &s;imple, and very much what &s;he wanted them to be, &s;he &s;ettled near the Glebe-hou&s;e, now and then taking a trip to London&mdash;in which, never ac|companying her, we cannot pre|tend to a&s;certain her bu&s;ine&s;s; no gro&s;s vapours of &s;lander ever pur|&s;ued her from the metropolis to le&s;&s;en the e&s;teem &s;he was regarded with in the neighborhood, whither the purity of the &s;urrounding at|mo&s;phere might have repelled them we cannot determine.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="035553_0011_10055FAEAFF4EAA0">Mrs. Owens &s;at down puffing and blowing, a tear dropped on her cheek, &s;he felt another &s;tarting and timely wiped it away with the corner of her apron.</P>
<P>My dear friend is gone, &s;aid &s;he, an&s;wering the interrogations of Mrs. Crofts, my &s;weet friend, a &s;ad lo&s;s I have &s;u&s;tained&mdash;but, as poor Frank &s;ays, we mu&s;t all go, my dear friend&mdash;&s;he has left me two hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Mrs. Crofts declared &s;he did not wonder at her grief, her friend was a valuable per&s;on, and &s;he well knew what it was to lo&s;e the deare&s;t connexions. Her hu&s;band had been dead the&s;e five years, yet &s;he &s;till wept over his memo|ry; here her tears began to flow, and the afflicted matrons found it requi&s;ite to partake of an admirable

cordial which Mrs. Crofts recom|mended as a mo&s;t effectual remedy for grief.</P>
<P>Mrs. Owens a&s;ked her advice concerning the di&s;po&s;al of the le|gacy, hinting her intention of go|ing to London. Mrs. Crofts de|clared it was the wi&s;e&s;t &s;cheme in the world&mdash;that perfections &s;uch as her children po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;hould not be concealed; they were not born to bloom un&s;een; in &s;hort the journey was &s;trenuou&s;ly recom|mended.</P>
<P>The affair was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed over and over, preliminaries adju&s;ted; to London Mrs. Owens was de|termined to go, and Mrs. Crofts was to give recommendatory let|lers and procure lodgings at a cou&s;in of her's.</P>

<P>No truly, exclaimed &s;he, not one of tho&s;e things &s;hall be done with my legacy. I intend going to London with the children;&mdash; Yes, Mr. Owens, continued &s;he, with more violence, perceiving his a&s;toni&s;hment, we are not always to be &s;ecluded, we were not born to bloom un&s;een; as Mrs. Crofts &s;ays.</P>

<P>When the poor par&s;on was con|vinced of the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of her in|tention, he earne&s;tly be&s;ought her to alter her mind; he pointed out every avenue to danger, and con|jured

<P>I dont know what you mean, &s;aid Mrs. Owens, petti&s;hly, by your doves and hawks. I &s;uppo&s;e you would have me cooing for ever by your &s;ide, but no, Mr. Owens, it will not do, and you mu&s;t po&s;itively hire a carriage to morrow, for on the next day I am re&s;olved to go, which proves, fa|ther, replied Ja&s;per, who had li&s;|tened to the whole controver&s;y, &s;he will have her own way, <HI>ergo</HI> to town &s;he goes.</P>

<P>She &s;poke not, but putting her hand into her pocket, pulled out a little green &s;ilk pur&s;e &s;he had knit, and pre&s;enting it to him, de|clared &s;he &s;hould ever rernember with gratitude his kind attentions: He received her gift with tran&s;|port, and with an emotion he could not &s;uppre&s;s, catching her to his bo&s;om, cried&mdash;Oh! my lovely, my deare&s;t Con&s;tantia, could I repleni&s;h as often as I'd wi&s;h&mdash;this pur&s;e, you would not,

I tru&s;t, think of leaving the fold of the&s;e fond arms.</P>
<P>Fearing he had &s;aid too much, he quitted his hold with precipita|tion, and ran out of the garden.</P>
<P>Poor Con&s;tantia pur&s;ued him with her eyes, while her bo&s;om ex|perienced &s;trange feelings. Tears involuntarily trickled down her cheek, and at that in&s;tant &s;he would have heard with plea&s;ure, that her mother meant not to have quit the Glebe.</P>
<P>Coverly, now in his nine and twentieth year, was tall and thin, a thinne&s;s cau&s;ed by an innate and &s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s;&mdash;without pre|ten&s;ions to beauty, his counte|nance was &s;trongly marked with the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s expre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ibi|lity,
<PB N="23" REF="035553_0023_10055FCE1D820038">
while the &s;pirit of his dark eyes, denoted their illuminating &s;oul, warm, generous and intre|pid.</P>
<P>Finances, &s;carcely amounting to a &s;upport compelled him to that ob&s;curity, he appeared by nature never formed for.</P>
<P>Whether he was a connexion of Sir Roger de Coverly's is a point we could never clearly learn, if &s;o, the good Old Knight's vir|tues were of an hereditary, or ra|ther a diffu&s;ive kind, and flowed with the &s;tream of life to the heart of his relation.</P>
<P>Though poor, pity was not all that Coverly be&s;towed on di&s;tre&s;s, frequently has he taken from his table, the &s;imple viands prepared
<PB N="24" REF="035553_0024_10055FCFA3B58290">
for him&s;elf, and delivered them to the creature enfeebled by poverty and pain.</P>
<P>He had been about five years in the country&mdash;on his fir&s;t com|ing, he &s;eemed &s;edulous to avoid &s;ociety, but the benevolent Owens, combatted his de&s;pondency and tempted him to become a con&s;tant vi&s;itor at the Glebe.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantia, then &s;carcely more than a child, attracted his notice; in her unfolding mind, he di&s;co|vered qualities which wanted that cultivation to yield the mo&s;t delec|table fruit, the thoughts of in|&s;tructing her in &s;ome of tho&s;e ele|gant accompli&s;hments he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;oothed his melancholy, and tho&s;e improvements her father had be|gun,
<PB N="25" REF="035553_0025_10055FD287615010">
received their la&s;t poli&s;h from the tuition of Coverly.</P>
<P>At this period his affection for her, was that of a brother, as &s;he grew up, feelings of a more ten|der, at lea&s;t a more anxious na|ture, occupied his brea&s;t; her mode&s;ty, her artle&s;s innocence, her blu&s;hing charms, were to him irre&s;i&s;tible. He had &s;een the mo&s;t poli&s;hed parts of the world, yet he never beheld her counterpart. The &s;weets of dome&s;tic life would have been balm to his &s;orrows, but the&s;e were &s;weets he dur&s;t not think of ta&s;ting, his narrow in|come rendering the maintenance of a family impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Accur&s;ed, cried he, with enthu|&s;ia&s;tic warmth, be that man, who
<PB N="26" REF="035553_0026_10055FD4C8DC0930">
for &s;elf gratification involves a wo|man he pretends to love, and per|haps a number of innocents, into the extremes of poverty; Con&s;tan|tia, thy Coverly &s;hall never be guilty of &s;uch villainy.</P>
<P>Her going to London was an unexpected &s;troke; he knew the credulity and vanity of Mrs. Ow|ens would expo&s;e the lovely blo&s;|&s;om, to the infectious bla&s;ts of flattery and vice.&mdash;He &s;ighed to point out the danger, but was ac|quainted with her po&s;itivene&s;s, and feared the family might im|pute his caution to intere&s;ted mo|tives.</P>
<P>He continued his race, with very little abatement, from the garden to the adjoining village which was two miles from the
<PB N="27" REF="035553_0027_10055FD7241676E0">
Glebe. Here the noi&s;e of the peo|ple rou&s;ed him from his reverie, he feared he had uttered too much; he does ju&s;t &s;carcely wi&s;h to excite a pa&s;&s;ion, before who&s;e completion fate had thrown &s;o ma|ny ob&s;tacles. He regretted his abrupt departure, had ten thou|&s;and things to &s;ay&mdash;the en&s;uing morning the journey was to com|mence.&mdash;He could not bear to pa&s;s the few remaining hours from the Glebe.&mdash;So buying &s;ome &s;piced cakes, as an excu&s;e for his &s;peedy return, in the evening brought them to Mrs. Owens.</P>
<P>The bu&s;tle of preparation was now over, the &s;tage was to take them up early the next day, and he found Mrs. Crofts writing let|ters of recommendation.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="035553_0028_10055FD8AA0DBB58">Coverly felt peevi&s;h, he could not controul him&s;elf, and contra|dicted the poor Par&s;on more than once.

was about leaving the room, when the voice of Mrs. Crofts exclaimed, "Sure Mr. Coverly you will &s;ee me home," detained him.</P>
<P>Early in the morning the &s;tage coach took them up: had duty al|lowed it, the worthy par&s;on could have wi&s;hed to be the guardian of his family, but that was impo&s;&s;i|ble.&mdash;He wept in &s;pite of his ef|forts.</P>
<P>Mrs. Owens, now &s;ure of go|ing, was al&s;o affected&mdash;&s;he &s;hed tears, and gave old Deb a thou|&s;and charges to take care of her ma&s;ter.</P>

father that he would be an old Trojan by the time he came back.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantia wanted power to &s;peak,&mdash;never did &s;he appear more attracting. Dre&s;t in a habit of dimity, her hair in its wonted lux|uriance, flowing from under a &s;traw hat, lined with the pale&s;t &s;hade of pink, which gave a faint tint to her cheeks that were this morning totally pale.</P>
<P>The par&s;on recommended a number of good books to his wife, particularly a volume of excellent &s;ermons: but whether from mi&s;|take or hurry, is not certain, &s;he took the Fortunate Country Maid in its place.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="035553_0031_10055FE006B233F0">There were no other pa&s;&s;engers in the coach, and they wheeled off with varied emotions.</P>
<P>As they approached the dwell|ing of Coverly, Con&s;tantia&punc; bent forward; an unintere&s;ted object might have viewed the pro&s;pect with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The cottage which was &s;mall, but elegantly neat, &s;tood on the &s;ummit of one of tho&s;e low hills which &s;kirted the vale. Some clumps of trees ca&s;t a &s;hade upon the windows, and a winding path led up to the door.</P>
<P>The &s;loping garden on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">r of the hill, was adorned with the mo&s;t beautiful flowers, inter&s;per&s;ed with choice old fruit trees; on the bank of the river winding beneath,
<PB N="32" REF="035553_0032_10055FE18CDC05D0">
was formed a bower, con&s;i&s;ting of the interwoven branches of wood|bine, part of which had crept round an old elm, on who&s;e bark the name of Con&s;tantia was en|graved.</P>
<P>As &s;he probably conjectured, Coverly was watching their ap|pearance. He called to the man to &s;top. Con&s;tantia's hand re&s;ted on the door; Coverly darted for|ward, &s;eized it, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips, while the gli&s;tening tear &s;tood in either eye&mdash;he hemmed, complained of a cold, and put into the carriage a handkerchief of fruit ju&s;t pulled.</P>
<P>Mrs. Owens begged him to vi|&s;it poor Frank often, and that he would take care of him&s;elf, as he looked very ill, a&s;&s;uring him, that
<PB N="33" REF="035553_0033_10055FE4F9A3D430">
Deb made excellent whey. He bowed, &s;miled, and drew back, the coachman whipped his hor&s;es, and off they flew.</P>
<P>Coverly was transfixed, the noi&s;e of the wheels &s;till re&s;ounded in his ears&mdash;at length he return|ed to his hou&s;e. The little boy who attended him, a&s;ked if he was ill? he neither could an&s;wer the poor child, nor partake of the breakfa&s;t he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly had pre|pared. Shortly after, he walked out, and &s;oon found him&s;elf in the road the carriage had taken. A&s;hamed of his weakne&s;s, he changed his cour&s;e, nor recollect|ed, till the &s;triking of the village clock&punc; that it was time to vi&s;it the par&s;on.</P>

Oh may they return with that &s;ereni|ty of innocence in which they left me: Yet, alas, my heart trembles for them, they are all the offspring of &s;implicity, and expo&s;ed to the machinations of the ba&s;e. I did all that the gen|tlene&s;s of my temper would allow, to combat the inclination of my wife. Oh, may &s;he never have rea&s;on to rue her oppo&s;ition to my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>He wanted Coverly to re&s;ide with him during their ab&s;ence. Coverly promi&s;ed to be frequently

with him, but could not think of quitting his cottage entirely, where he could have &s;ome private hours for the luxurious indulgence of concealed grief.</P>
<P>After feeding Con&s;tantia's gold|finches he touched her guittar, which had been a New Year's gift from him, but the &s;trings were di&s;cordant, and he found that with her, Harmony had for|&s;aken the Glebe Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now bid adieu to the gentlemen for &s;ome time, and pur&s;ue the travellers.</P>
<P>Nothing occurred during the fir&s;t day of their journey worth reciting, on the &s;econd, when ar|rived at the inn where they were to dine; a gentleman, who had

<P>Scarce had they entered the par|lour, when the ho&s;te&s;s followed, pre&s;enting the compliments of the &s;trangers, with an invitation to an entertainment they were ju&s;t &s;it|ting down to.</P>
<P>Mrs. Owens elated by this un|expected civility, in&s;tantly drew up her head, and with elevated cre&s;t, cried, upon my word they are va&s;tly polite; but pray, my good woman do you know&mdash;</P>

<P>He &s;eated them at the table, taking care to place him&s;elf oppo|&s;ite Con&s;tantia, of who&s;e per&s;on, in a &s;ly manner, he took an ex|act &s;urvey, and evidently appear|ed enraptured with her.</P>

for their ance&s;try and affluence, I was their only child, and they vied with each other in adoring me, they thought I mu&s;t be the darling of every heart, and the admiration of every eye, and that Heaven &s;miled benignly upon them, in be&s;towing &s;uch a child.</P>
<P>They were ambitious of hav|ing me allied to a family, illu&s;tri|ous as their own, and indulged the mo&s;t flattering pre&s;ages of my future aggrandizement.</P>
<P>I had attained my two and twentieth year, when chance bro't me acquainted with the widow of an officer and her daughter, who had taken a &s;mall cottage in our neighbourhood.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="035553_0067_10056038369115F0">"The mother was the gentle&s;t. be&s;t of women&mdash;the daughter&mdash; but I want words to give you an idea of her; not that her image is ab&s;ent from my brea&s;t, oh, no, its fixed here from the fir&s;t moment I beheld her.</P>
<P>Nature had been profu&s;e of its lovelie&s;t gifts, and her mind was as cele&s;tial, as its repo&s;itory cha&s;te, ingenious, undi&s;&s;embling, while mourning over an unfortunate fa|ther's fate, &s;he endeavoured to &s;up|port her mother, though ill able her&s;elf, to bear up again&s;t a&s;&s;aults of affliction.</P>
<P>I pitied, I e&s;teemed, and oh! how &s;oon I loved: nor was &s;he in&s;en&s;ible to the fervor of my pa&s;|&s;ion, when lo&s;t in &s;weet confu&s;ion,
<PB N="68" REF="035553_0068_10056039BAD91810">
&s;he acknowledged I was dear to her.</P>
<P>My love I carefully concealed, as al&s;o my vi&s;its to the cottage; I knew full well the ambition of my parents, and that though they a|dored me, they would &s;ooner &s;a|crifice me, than their elevated hopes&mdash;how &s;trange that ambition &s;hould have power over the feel|ings of nature&mdash;time, I thought, would weaken their pride and &s;ub|due the prejudices of education, and convince them that worth and beauty would dignify any &s;tation.</P>
<P>My mother &s;oon noticed a dejection in my manner, and my frequent ab&s;ence from home alarm|ed her exceedingly&mdash;&s;he was of an enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, and re&s;olved

<P>The time is &s;till pre&s;ent to view; when kneeling by the bed &s;ide, the mother took our hands between hers, and wept over and ble&s;&s;ed us&mdash;while I called upon high Heaven to witne&s;s I ever would protect her daughter.</P>
<P>The widow died &s;hortly after my departure, and my mother only waited for her to be con&s;ign|ed to the earth, ere &s;he vi&s;ited her orphan.</P>

<P>The deadly palene&s;s of her face, the langui&s;hing &s;oftne&s;s of eyes, denoted how much &s;he re|quired comfort&mdash;the re&s;entment of Mrs. Montfort was forgotten&mdash; the bur&s;ting tear declared her &s;ym|pathetic feeling; but they were feelings of a &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>At the mention of her name, a faint gleam of plea&s;ure beamed over I&s;abella's countenance.</P>
<P>My mother acquainted her with the occa&s;ion of her vi&s;it&mdash;a&s;|&s;ured her that my pa&s;&s;ion pro|ceeding

<P>I&s;abella &s;huddered, &s;he would have &s;aid my love was unaltera|ble; but her voice faultered; and my mother proceeded,&mdash;</P>
<P>She repre&s;ented the meanne&s;s of entering into a family &s;o aver&s;e to her; the folly of depending on an impetuous young man for felicity, who di&s;regarded by his

<P>But this was not &s;ufficient; enquiring into every particular concerning the unfortunate girl, &s;he learned there was a young farmer violently in love with her; &s;he therefore a&s;&s;ured her, that while &s;he remained &s;ingle, pa&s;&s;ion, fed by hope, would prompt me not to give her up&mdash;rea&s;oned on the nece&s;&s;ity of chu&s;ing a protec|tor

<P>Aye, why &s;hould there? ex|claimed Mrs. Owens, her eyes &s;wimming in tears of delight, my maxim is to &s;ecure good when it's offered; ah, ble&s;s you, I'm not one of tho&s;e &s;hilly &s;hally folks that &s;tands as if I did'nt know whether

to take or refu&s;e what I have a de|&s;ire for.</P>
<P>No, that you are not, my love, &s;aid the par&s;on, don't you remem|ber how you threw me out of my chair, once in your hurry?&mdash; and how another day you broke the &s;et of candle-cups your aunt Bridget gave you, by your ha&s;te?</P>
<P>Mr. Montfort interrupted the par&s;on's enumeration of accidents, by leading Ja&s;per to the blu&s;hing Lucy, who at fir&s;t he&s;itated, but as her inclination coincided with his, (though mode&s;ty deemed it nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t to oppo&s;e) &s;he &s;oon yielded con&s;ent to change her &s;tate on the &s;ame day with Con|&s;tantia; and received from the tran&s;ported Ja&s;per a &s;tring of com|pliments quite in the &s;ublime or|der.</P>
<P>Mrs. Owens appeared &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of what &s;he was doing; in vain her hu&s;band preached mo|deration, all was hurry and &s;chemes

of grandeur; and in this derange|ment of ideas, &s;he was near demo|li&s;hing &s;ome of his manu&s;cript &s;er|mons, to put under confectionaries, had he not timely entered, and re&s;|cued them from her mercile&s;s hands.</P>
<P>The wi&s;hed for morning at length arrived&mdash;the party walked to the church without any pomp, innocence and felicity were alone in their train, the birds from every bough appeared to &s;ing hymeneals, and to their gladdened eyes the earth wore a more &s;miling a&s;pect. &mdash;Montfort gave both ladies away, and the good par&s;on tied the irre|vocable knot.</P>
<P>Having now I think (as Adam &s;ays) brought my &s;tory to the &s;um of earthly bli&s;s, I cannot conclude without fir&s;t relating the e&s;tabli&s;h|ments of my heroes and heroines:</P>
<P>Montfort, their generous friend, provided for all;</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="035553_0119_100560A315A4B5E0">Coverley's hou&s;e was enlarged, but &s;till retained all the &s;implicity of architecture; from its amiable inmates he experiences that &s;oothing unremitting attention, which has diffu&s;ed felicity through his mind; he has made it his con&s;tant abode, and terms it&mdash;"The Re&s;idence of True Content."</P>
<P>Ja&s;per took orders, and has a beneficial living about five miles from the Glebe;&mdash;he per&s;everes in that path which his father led him from his infantine days; po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;cious rectitude, an amiable wife, and a blooming pro|geny he boa&s;ts a happine&s;s, even the great might envy.</P>
<P>Pure and unruffled flow on the days of Coverly and Con&s;tantia. Montfort's tears often &s;teal down, from the fulne&s;s of joy in behold|ing theirs; and, in tho&s;e moments he withdraws to &s;olitude with his little God-daughter I&s;abella, in who&s;e features, he traces a re&s;em|blance of his ever beloved.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="035553_0120_100560A5FB44DDE8">The par&s;on and his wife, are as happy a couple as live;&mdash;and though &s;he &s;ometimes takes a &s;hort flight from the ne&s;t, &s;he always returns to her lovey with &s;miles of affection.</P>
<P>Mr. Montfort &s;eeks the dwell|ings of the wretched, chearing and relieving every child of &s;orrow;&mdash; &s;o that the poor inhabitants have rea&s;on to ble&s;s the hour he &s;ettled near the Glebe Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We have long detained our rea|ders in a &s;imple man&s;ion, from which, perhaps, they thought no|thing could be ob&s;erved worthy regard&mdash;though the pro&s;pect is plain and unvariegated, we tru&s;t, no object appeared in it, that had not a tendency to prove that&mdash;a per&s;everance in prudence and vir|tue only can be&s;tow felicity.</P>
<P>We now bid them FAREWELL, and hope if they have found no|thing in The Glebe Hou&s;e to ap|plaud, they will at lea&s;t be a neu|tral power, and not condemn.</P>
