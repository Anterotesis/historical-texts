<P>WAS it then re&s;erved for a Stranger to your Per&s;ons, and your Altars, to addre&s;s you on this happy Re&s;toration of your public Wor&s;hip? This &s;olemn Re e&s;tabli&s;hment of your Religious A&s;&s;emblies? Was it to have been the good Fortune of One, to whom you were un|known, but by your Sufferings, to be among the fir&s;t of the Mini&s;ters of God, to bring the Comfort and Con|&s;olation of his Word to an afflicted and per&s;ecuted People? To tell them, that he has not forgotten <HI>his loving Kindne&s;&s;e&s;s of old,</HI>&mdash;that however he &s;eemed re|&s;olved to <HI>cha&s;ten them in his Di&s;plea&s;ure; to ca&s;t off his Altar and abhor his Sanctuary; to cau&s;e the &s;olemn Fea&s;ts and Sabbaths to be forgotten, and, in the Indignation of his Wrath, to reject the King and the Prie&s;t</HI>&mdash;that how|ever he &s;uffers <HI>their City to be left de&s;olate and broken down, and every Hou&s;e &s;hut up, &s;o that no Man may come in:</HI> yet that he will <HI>return again in his Mercy, in his appointed Time, to have Compa&s;&s;ion upon his afflicted, to comfort his oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> and to <HI>bring them again every Man to his Heritage, and every Man to his Land; to &s;ay to the Pri&s;oners, Go forth, and to them that are in Darkne&s;s, Shew your&s;elves; to re&s;tore their Princes as at the Fir&s;t, and their Coun&s;ellors as at the Beginning, and again to give them Prie&s;ts according to his Heart?</HI> Let it be my fir&s;t Care to ble&s;s his holy Name for having per|mitted

me to join with your returning Clergy in the Di&s;charge of this plea&s;ing Office. They al&s;o will add their Prai&s;es to mine.&mdash;You, my Brethren, will not be wanting in Gratitude and Thankfulne&s;s to the God of your Redemption, and the united Voice of <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>People</HI> will be&mdash;<HI>It is good that a Man &s;hould both hope, and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord</HI>&punc; His Ways are in&s;crutable, but his Goodne&s;s certain and without Bounds.</P>
<P>WHO that was Witne&s;s of the cruel and di&s;a&s;trous Deed of the Night before la&s;t, could promi&s;e him&s;elf, that you &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled this Day in the Hou&s;e of God, to prai&s;e him for your wonderful Deliverance? Who could have hoped that this Temple would remain a Monument of the returning Favour of Heaven, amid&s;t the Horror of the Ruins through which you mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed to approach it? Which of you could have &s;aid to him&s;elf, that he &s;hould &s;ee the&s;e Doors opened once more for the Reception of the Faithful, <HI>tho' as yet but as the Shaking of an Olive Tree, and the Gleaning Grapes when the Vintage is done?</HI> Or hear the&s;e Walls, &s;o long &s;ilent and unfrequented, filled again with the Prai&s;es of him, to who&s;e Name you had rai&s;ed them? Is not this the Lord's Doing? Is not this our God for <HI>whom we have waited? We have waited for him, he hath &s;aved us, and we will be glad and rejoice in his Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>SUFFER me, however, to check for a Moment, the Ferment which the&s;e different Sen&s;ations of Joy and Grief, &s;o rapidly &s;ucceeding each other within the&s;e few Days pa&s;t, mu&s;t naturally have rai&s;ed in your Brea&s;ts. When the Heart, long oppre&s;&s;ed, and clo&s;ed in Affliction, is &s;uddenly opened to the Impre&s;&s;ions of Joy, only to be overwhelmed as &s;uddenly with an ad|ditional Weight of Sorrow and Di&s;may, the Tumult within mu&s;t be too violent to leave much Room for calm and u&s;eful Reflections. It &s;hall therefore be my Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="043111_0004_101CCC03DCC82A00">
to endeavour to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch Thoughts as appear &s;uitable to this extraordinory Occa&s;ion, and to regu|late your pre&s;ent Affections, in a Manner that be&s;t becomes the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t.&mdash;This has never been, and I am confident never will be, the Pulpit of Contention or Strife. No <HI>Prophets, prophe&s;ying Lies in the Name of the Lord who &s;ent them not,</HI> &s;hall ever turn it into a Stage for Sedition. The Words of Truth and Life will never be perverted here in promoting Violence and Blood&s;hed, under Pretence of con&s;ulting the Intere&s;ts of the God of Peace; to cau&s;e the Reli|gion of the lowly, mild and meek Je&s;us to &s;peak the Language of Ambition, Slaughter and Revenge; or to con&s;ecrate and deliver out in his Name, the Sword that is to be plunged by his Followers into each others Brea&s;ts. Thanks be to the Lord, <HI>we have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t.</HI> We will neither abu&s;e his Mercy, and long Forbearance our&s;elves, by thus daring to pro&s;titute his awful Name; nor &s;hall we pre&s;ume to deal out the Bolts of his Vengeance again&s;t others, whom his Ju&s;tice may arraign as guilty of &s;uch Profanation.&mdash;I there|fore repeat it again, our only Bu&s;ine&s;s will be to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch Reflections as &s;hould engage the Minds of Chri&s;t|ians on this Occa&s;ion, to exhort you to turn your Thoughts to your&s;elves; to con&s;ider the Redemption that has been wrought in your Favour, and the Di&s;po|&s;itions with which you &s;hould receive the&s;e In&s;tances of the Divine Mercies.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Con&s;ideration that ari&s;es from the Subject, is the grateful Sen&s;e you &s;hould entertain of the Good|ne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>THE immediate Impre&s;&s;ions of Gratitude for pre&s;ent Benefits are &s;trong, lively and affecting. We feel them with Warmth; we expre&s;s them with Rapture&mdash;But it happens too frequently that we enjoy them with In|difference, and by Degrees totally forget the gracious Hand that conferred them. While we are in Danger,
<PB N="8" REF="043111_0005_101CCC370E09F2C8">
and Fear is upon us, we <HI>call upon the Name of the Lord</HI>: Our Sins and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions affect us in their Con&s;e|quences; and our future Obedience, Fidelity, and Gratitude, are fervently pledged in the Hopes of imme|diate Protection and Relief. But when the fir&s;t Sen&s;e of our Delivery is pa&s;t, when our Enemies are &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, and the Danger removed, we are too apt to forget the Re&s;olutions we formed in the Hour of Di|&s;tre&s;s; our former Pa&s;&s;ions and evil Habits too fre|quently return with our former Security. The God of our Salvation is forgotten, and repayed with Ingrati|tude, Neglect and Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>THE Conduct of Individuals is, generally &s;peaking, the Conduct of the Community. Ingratitude for Fa|vours, tho' a Di&s;grace to our Nature, is but too com|mon in the private Intercour&s;es of Life; nor are In|&s;tances le&s;s frequent of the ungrateful Returns which Nations have made for public Benefits confered upon them. The odious Vice, in either Ca&s;e, receives its Aggravation in Proportion to the Mercies we have experienced, the Favours we have been ble&s;&s;ed with, and the Character of our Benefactor: But &s;hould it extend to that Benificent Power, in whom we move, and have our being, and rob him of the return he challenges from his Creatures for his boundle&s;s Mercy and Love, it then a&s;&s;umes its mo&s;t deformed Shape: It then receives its utmo&s;t Weight and Accumulation of Guilt.</P>
<P>ALL that is &s;acred or dear upon Earth&mdash;your Re|ligion, your civil Rights and Liberties, the Enjoyment of your Property, the Freedom of your Per&s;ons, the Wor&s;hip of your God, the Comfort of the Sacraments, the Pre&s;ence and Exhortation of your Mini&s;ters&mdash;all that you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and gloried in as Briti&s;h Subjects and as Chri&s;tians, wre&s;ted from you by Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion, while <HI>the Shepherds were &s;mitten and the Sheep of the Flock &s;cattered abroad</HI>&mdash;all the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings,
<PB N="9" REF="043111_0006_101CCC0565E92788">
valuable &s;urely, if there be any &s;o on this Side the Grave, and the dearer to you now for having been &s;o cruelly deprived of them, hath your God begun to re&s;tore to you in this your Day; and with his &s;tretched-out Arm, in a Manner vi&s;ible to every Eye, brought you back to a Pro&s;pect of happier Days, and placed you again under the protecting Care of the ancient Guardians of your Religion and Liberty. And can it be po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould ever &s;uffer the Remem|brance of the divine Mercies, thus extended to you, to be blotted out from your Minds? It were doing wrong to tho&s;e who have &s;uffered with the Fortitude and Per&s;everance, the Loyalty and Attachment to their Sovereign, which have di&s;tingui&s;hed the Friends of Government in this Colony, even to &s;uppo&s;e it. And I &s;hould hope that they who have endured &s;o long and painful a Trial, rather than renounce their Loyalty, or the religious Principles on which that Loyalty is chiefly founded, will never hereafter be guilty of any Action, or pur&s;ue any Conduct, that can di&s;grace them as good Subjects, or as virtuous Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>BUT while I thus exhort you to per&s;evere in your grateful Acknowledgments to the God of your Re|demption, let me not neglect a Point of equal Import|ance to you, equally acceptable to him. The U&s;e, which in his gracious Providence he de&s;igns we &s;hould make of the Mi&s;conduct of others, or of the Puni&s;h|ments which our Sins may have brought on our&s;elves, is frequently pointed out in the Scriptures. His Vi&s;itations he &s;ets up as Marks to caution us again&s;t the Rocks and Shelves on which Folly and Vice have already cau&s;ed &s;o many to be wrecked; and wilfully to run upon them is to &s;light the divine Mercy&mdash;is an Aggravation of all our former Guilt, and ju&s;tly expo&s;es us to &s;till more &s;evere Ef|fects of the Wrath of Heaven. The P&s;almi&s;t, enume|rating the various Calamities inflicted on the I&s;raelites for their Incredulity and Di&s;obedience, mentions, as a Source of additional Mi&s;eries to this &s;tiff-necked Peo|ple,
<PB N="10" REF="043111_0007_101CCC3896987068">
that they neglected to profit by their own fatal Ex|perience, or the dreadful Examples they daily &s;aw before their Eyes, of the Lord's Indignation. They refu&s;ed to humble them&s;elves beneath the divine Cha&s;ti&s;ement, but continued to provoke their Deliverer by fre&s;h Proofs of Ingratitude. <HI>The Wrath of God came upon them, and &s;mote down the cho&s;en Men of I&s;rael; for all this they &s;inned &s;till&mdash;therefore their Days did he con&s;ume in Vanity, and their Years in Troubles.</HI> Entering into the&s;e Views, my Brethren, con&s;ider with me the Steps that have led your Country into its pre&s;ent Calamities&mdash;you will be the better enabled to check them in future, at lea&s;t to decline and avoid them your&s;elves.&mdash;The Exce&s;&s;es of others will teach you a Le&s;&s;on of Prudence and Mo|deration to regulate your own Conduct.</P>
<P><HI>MY Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and med|dle not with them that are given to change</HI>&mdash;was the excellent Rule laid down by the wi&s;e&s;t of Men. Again&s;t tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;s it, he denounces a &s;udden and inevitable De&s;truction. Whatever they may pro|mi&s;e them&s;elves,&mdash;However they may &s;eem to pro&s;per for a Time, Ruin, infallible Ruin, awaits them when lea&s;t they expect it; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee the Mi&s;eries they may entail on them&s;elves and their De&s;cendants&mdash;"<HI>their Calamity &s;hall ri&s;e &s;uddenly; and who knoweth the Ruin of them both?</HI> The Words are remarkable, but they are dictated by Wi&s;dom, and &s;upported by Experience. It has happened from your former pro&s;perous State, and the pre&s;ent Calamities of this Province, from which <HI>you</HI> happily begin to re&s;pire, that no Nation upon Earth can form a better Judgment upon this important Que&s;tion than your|&s;elves; and I have before me, in this A&s;&s;embly, a living Example to which alone I need refer.</P>
<P>CALL then to Mind the happy and pro&s;perous Days this Colony enjoyed, when Loyalty to your Sove|reign, Affection for the Con&s;titution of your parent
<PB N="11" REF="043111_0008_101CCC08306DA4E0">
State, and Obedience to the Laws you enjoyed under its Protection, di&s;tingui&s;hed it above all the other Pro|vinces of America. Your Condition was then an Object of Envy to Nations corrupted by the Refine|ments of Luxury. Peace was in your Dwellings, Plenty in your Streets&mdash;Indu&s;try diffu&s;ed her Ble&s;&s;ings through your Fields with an increa&s;ing Profu&s;ion, giving Life to all the u&s;eful Arts, and nurturing them daily into Maturity and Perfection. The Produce of your Country flowed from your Port in a con&s;tant uninterrupted Stream, and you received in Return the Conveniencies and Comforts of Life, and all the Ele|gancies which a free and exten&s;ive Commerce can be&s;tow on a prudent and contented People. A friendly, ho&s;|pitable, and &s;ocial Intercour&s;e united you together as the Members of one Family, to the Admiration and Delight of Strangers who re&s;ided among you&mdash;you were ble&s;&s;ed beyond the u&s;ual Lot of Men&mdash;Happy, completely &s;o, did you but know how to value your Happine&s;s, and to pre&s;erve it!</P>
<P>HOW different the Scene to which I mu&s;t call off your Attention! what a Change of Pro&s;pect will the Rever&s;e exhibit! where &s;hall we &s;eek for that Trea|&s;ure of Happine&s;s which you could boa&s;t, when every Man &s;at under his own Vine, and eat his Bread with Chearfulne&s;s? Alas! Is it not wa&s;ted all, and con|&s;umed in vi&s;ionary Schemes, empty and fanciful as the Dreams of the Morning! Is it not &s;quandered away in lawle&s;s and ungrateful Attempts, repugnant to every Principle divine and human? In Pur&s;uits which plain Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on condemn, and at which even the Impul&s;es of Nature mu&s;t recoil? Peace, frightened from the Seats where once &s;he loved to dwell, long &s;ince took her Flight from among you. Di&s;&s;entions, party Rage, public Enmities, and private Animo&s;ities, u&s;urped her Place, and brought with them a horrid Train of mutual Fears, Di&s;tru&s;ts, and endle&s;s Jea|lou&s;ies. By the&s;e were the Confidence and Harmony
<PB N="12" REF="043111_0009_101CCC3A218EF528">
of all &s;ocial Intercour&s;e de&s;troyed; by the&s;e were the Bands of Love and Friend&s;hip torn a&s;under; by the&s;e were even the Ties of Con&s;anguinity and Nature di&s;|&s;olved. Self-intere&s;t, Self-pre&s;ervation, the Welfare of Po&s;terity, Principles ingrafted in the human Mind by the benificent Creator, were all confounded and lo&s;t in this dark and di&s;mal Night of Confu&s;ion, Anar|chy, and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s. See Indu&s;try perverted from its u&s;eful Purpo&s;es, and employed in improving the Arts of De&s;truction. Your <HI>Plough-Shears</HI> it turned into <HI>Swords,</HI> and your <HI>Pruning-Hocks</HI> into <HI>Spears,</HI> the Re|ver&s;e of the Ble&s;&s;ing pronounced by <HI>I&s;aiah.</HI> See your Fields once cultivated, the Gardens of America, laid wa&s;te and turned into licentious Encampments and the de&s;olating Scenes of War;&mdash;&s;ee your Commerce, your envied Commerce, de&s;troyed, your Property &s;eized and di&s;&s;ipated in Support of the Cau&s;e you abhored&mdash;your Liberties de&s;pi&s;ed and trodden under Foot&punc; and an arm|ed Multitude in&s;ulting over your Mi&s;eries, turned loo&s;e upon your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and rioting in your Sub&s;tance. In vain you looked up to Ju&s;tice for Support&mdash;her Seats were overthrown, and trampled in the Du&s;t; her Ru|lers di&s;per&s;ed, and the People abandoned to every wild Impul&s;e of Humour and Pa&s;&s;ion, without Laws, with|out Magi&s;trates, without Form of Government. In &s;hort, too well might we apply to you the Words of Jeremiah&mdash;<HI>If you went forth into the Fields, behold the Slain with the Sword; if you entered into the City, behold &s;he that was full of Inhabitants, and Prince&s;s among the Provinces, &s;itting &s;olitary, and become as a di&s;con&s;olate,</HI> childle&s;s <HI>Widow.&mdash;Both the Prophet and the Prie&s;t went about in a Land they knew not&mdash;your Friends dealt treach|erou&s;ly with you, and became your Enemies, while you were gone into Captivity, becau&s;e of Affliction, and becau&s;e of great Servitude.</HI></P>
<P>To what Cau&s;es are we to attribute this deplorable Change? Whence is it that you can &s;ay to your&s;elves, Such was the Happine&s;s we once could boa&s;t; &s;uch the melancholy Rever&s;e we have experienced! I have
<PB N="13" REF="043111_0010_101CCC0AD5C86A80">
heard &s;ome attribute it to the Imperfection of human Nature, incapable of enjoying a durable State of Pro&s;|perity, and oftentimes mo&s;t di&s;contented, when ble&s;&s;ed with the greate&s;t Cau&s;e of Content. But I &s;hall &s;earch for it among the Sources of the Decay and Fall of Na|tions, which the Scriptures of God point out to me. Warranted by the&s;e, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to a&s;&s;ert, that if this Province had continued <HI>to fear the Lord, and the King, and had not meddled with tho&s;e who are given to change</HI>; the Tempe&s;t would have &s;pent its Rage at a Di&s;tance from you, and Peace, Indu&s;try, and Happi|ne&s;s would &s;till have ble&s;&s;ed your Dwellings, as they did of old. You, indeed, my Friends, &s;eem to have been well convinced of this Truth. The Struggle you maintained was vigorous, and for &s;ome Time &s;ucce&s;sful &mdash;But all were not animated with your Spirit. The Love of Novelty&mdash;or whatever other Cau&s;es the Pow|ers of Darkne&s;s be&s;t can tell&mdash;for it is impo&s;&s;ible to ac|count for &s;uch Folly and Madne&s;s on any known Prin|ciples&mdash;&s;educed too many from their Allegiance to their Sovereign, and their former happy Attachment to the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution; and the&s;e ancient Barriers be|ing once removed, all the Di&s;orders that have well nigh overthrown your Country, broke in upon you, and the Depre&s;&s;ion of your Religion, for the Time, follow|ed of Cour&s;e. So true it is, that when Re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s and Di&s;content once po&s;&s;e&s;s the Mind, it is impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee to what Extremes a Rage for Innovation, and a Pa&s;&s;ion for Change, will tran&s;port their Votaries. They are like the <HI>unclean Spirit</HI> mentioned in the Go&s;|pel, always on the Wing, <HI>&s;eeking</HI> a Place of <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> but <HI>never finding it.</HI> Exce&s;&s;es, at which Men would have &s;huddered at their fir&s;t &s;etting out, <HI>&s;wept clean,</HI> and placed in a delu&s;ive Point of View by Faction and Party, lo&s;e their Deformity, and daily make Way for other Exce&s;&s;es &s;till more criminal, &s;till more enormous. The&s;e di&s;&s;atisfied <HI>Spirits take to them&s;elves other Spirits more wicked than them&s;elves, and the la&s;t State of the&s;e Men becomes wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</HI> I need not make the Ap|plication
<PB N="14" REF="043111_0011_101CCC3D29ED3EF0">
&mdash;It is but too manife&s;t&mdash;you have already done it for me.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid that when too many of this Pro|vince &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;educed from their Allegiance to their Sovereign, and their former happy Attachment to the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, the Depre&s;&s;ion of your Religion followed of Cour&s;e&mdash;Let me not be mi&s;under&s;tood&mdash;I mean not to engage in an invidious Point of Controver&s;y, which has often been carried to &s;uch fatal Lengths. Religious Di&s;putes obtrude them|&s;elves too frequently into Subjects of mere political Concern, and &s;erve no other End than to widen Divi|&s;ions, and encrea&s;e Animo&s;ities, which the Holy Sy&s;tem, the Intere&s;ts of which they would &s;eem to &s;upport, would wi&s;h to allay forever. Warmed with Zeal for their parti|cular Tenets, however une&s;&s;entially differing from each other, the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Di&s;putants work them&s;elves into the Controver&s;y, and we are apt to a&s;cribe their ra&s;h and intemperate Dictates to that Sy&s;tem, the De|fence of which they have embraced. There is al&s;o another Prejudice, which is apt to lead us a&s;tray in this important Matter. As in the different Forms of Government, at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed throughout the Chri&s;tian World, Religion is fundamentally connected with their civil and political In&s;titutes; we generally con&s;ider them as going Hand in Hand, and charge the Creed of each particular Sect with the political Errors and Di&s;orders of its Profe&s;&s;ors. A Church there is, indeed, who&s;e Principles have been proved by fatal Ex|perience to be &s;o e&s;&s;entially incon&s;i&s;tent with every No|tion of free and rational Government, &s;o infallibly in|troductive of a double Slavery, forging Chains both for the Body and Mind, that it has been de&s;ervedly branded with this foul Imputation, and ju&s;tly abhorred by Na|tions jealous of their Liberties. But that among Pro|te&s;tant Churches, &s;uch a Charge &s;hould be urged and retorted by each other, with &s;o much Virulence and Animo&s;ity, hath long been a Cau&s;e of Grief to every
<PB N="15" REF="043111_0012_101CCC0D8CBF9C60">
Well-wi&s;her of the Reformed Religion, and a great Subject of Triumph to their common Enemies, both at home and abroad. Let me not attempt to enlarge the Breach, or be guilty of an Error, which I condemn in others. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that in every Age, in every State, there are Men of depraved Hearts, who put on Religion as a Cloak to cover their &s;ini&s;ter Views; or u&s;e it as a political Tool to work upon the Minds of the Weak, and unin&s;tructed, and all, who&s;e Zeal without Knowledge renders them an ea&s;y Prey to the Arts of Seducers. The&s;e, like the Lame and Impo|tent at the Pool of Bethe&s;da, watch the Troubling of the Waters, that they may be the fir&s;t to take Ad|vantage of the public Commotions, and on the Ruins of the Peace and Happine&s;s of their Country, pave the Way to their own Advancement: Men, who declaim again&s;t every Power, but that which they have them|&s;elves u&s;urped; to whom the Pretence of the public Good, and the Intere&s;ts of their Country, is as ea&s;y as that of Religion; and who a&s;&s;ume both in com|mon with every re&s;tle&s;s Malecontent, who in every Age, under every Government, has de&s;troyed the Peace of the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>FROM what Cau&s;es <HI>your</HI> Sufferings may have origi|nated, this is not the Time, nor the Place to con&s;ider. Too certain it is, that they have now ri&s;en to &s;uch a Height of Aggravation, as needs no Words to repre|&s;ent to you&mdash;You feel it beyond the Energy of Words. The &s;mart of recent Wrongs, and former Injuries, &s;peaks a Language which tho&s;e who &s;ympathize with you in your Sufferings, can never adopt. Whatever the Principles of your Per&s;ecutors may be, their unre|lenting Malice is but too notorious; and they have ad|ded to all their former Exce&s;&s;es, a Deed of Atrociou&s;|ne&s;s which mu&s;t open the Eyes of the mo&s;t infatuated&mdash; mu&s;t totally alienate even the &s;mall Numbers, who may have hitherto been deluded into &s;ome favourable Opinion of their Cau&s;e. To what a Scene were you
<PB N="16" REF="043111_0013_101CCC4015759B48">
Witne&s;&s;es the Night before la&s;t! When ju&s;t e&s;caped from the Storm, and imagining your&s;elves arrived at a Port of Re&s;t; labouring to collect together the &s;mall Remains of your Fortune that had e&s;caped the general Wreck; meeting once more and embracing, after &s;o long and painful a Separation, the Objects of your tendere&s;t Affection, or &s;olacing your&s;elves with the Hopes of being &s;peedily re-united to tho&s;e who were yet detained in Bondage from you; congratulating your Friends on your mutual Deliverance, and the Pro&s;pect that was opening to you of returning Peace, Quiet and Security&mdash;In this Dawn of your Hopes and Expecta|tions, to awake at the Midnight Hour and find your City in Flames; to &s;ee your All peri&s;hing before your Eyes, and to know that your De&s;troyers were &s;ecretly among you, &s;preading the Ruin, and exulting in the Succe&s;s of their infernal Scheme!</P>
<P>THIS was not the &s;udden Act of a vanqui&s;hed and flying Enemy, perpetrated in the peevi&s;h Moment of Di&s;appointment and Defeat, or contrived to favour their E&s;cape. No,&mdash;&s;everal Days had elap&s;ed &s;ince their Flight, and Quiet &s;eemed to have revi&s;ited you under the Banner of your Deliverers. Even the ba&s;e Incendiaries returned among you, wearing the Ma&s;k of Peace. We hoped that they had repented of their Exce&s;&s;es&mdash;had been convinced of their Folly and Mad|ne&s;s, and meant to embrace the profered Clemency of their Sovereign, who was willing to forget the un|grateful Revolt again&s;t his Authority, their Contempt of his Crown and Government, and the In&s;ults of|fered to his Per&s;on. But they cried, <HI>Peace, Peace, when there was no Peace.</HI> The Blow they were medi|tating was the more dangerous from its being thus con|cealed&mdash;they gloried in &s;triking it home, and no|thing, under Heaven, but the Activity of your En|gli&s;h Friends, could have prevented the whole City's falling a Victim to their determined Malice. Yes, my Friends, ye were Witne&s;&s;es of it.&mdash;Ye &s;aw the treach|erous Adherents of the&s;e pretended Guardians of your

Had it plea&s;ed Heaven, that the Succe&s;s could have an&s;wered their Zeal, &s;o many Families once ble&s;&s;ed with Comfort and Affluence, would not have been turned out on the World, naked, helple&s;s, and &s;tripped of their All.&mdash; The Seminary of indigent Merit, where Poverty found a Re&s;ource again&s;t Ignorance, and where Charity re|claimed Thou&s;ands from Idlene&s;s and Di&s;&s;ipation to Virtue and Indu&s;try, would yet have &s;tood.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Fire of Saturday, Sept. 21, a Thou&s;and Hou&s;es, nearly One Fourth of the City, were laid in A&s;hes.

Some Child of Per|dition claimed to him&s;elf the Merit of this daring Sa|crilege, and involved the ancient and venerable Pile in the &s;ame Ruin with which they de&s;igned to extirpate all the Monuments of your Religion, every Ve&s;tige of your ancient Splendor and Glory.</P>
<P>IN this Scene of univer&s;al Danger and Di&s;tre&s;s, to what can the Mini&s;ters of God exhort you? Ill &s;hould we know <HI>what Manner of Spirit we were of,</HI> if we &s;uffered any Expre&s;&s;ions, that may have fallen from us, to be interpreted into a Breach of Charity, the Crown of Chri&s;tian Virtues; or into a De&s;ign of &s;harpening the Virulence of Party, or encrea&s;ing Animo&s;ities that have already too fatally de&s;troyed <HI>the Peace</HI> of your <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> To mini&s;ter &s;ome Con&s;olation in your Sufferings, as becometh the Teachers of the Go&s;pel, who mu&s;t be unworthy indeed of the Character they bear, not to feel for the Afflictions of their Brethren, who look to them for Comfort and In&s;truction; to &s;et before you <HI>the loving Kindne&s;&s;es of the Lord,</HI> and the Redemption he hath wrought in your Favour, and to exhort you to make every becoming Return for his Mercies and Love; to point out to you, and warn you again&s;t the Abu&s;es that have brought Ruin upon your Country&mdash;this has been our only Aim.&mdash;If we have &s;ucceeded, all our Wi&s;hes are &s;atisfied, and we &s;hall have the Con&s;olation to think that you will &s;anctify this Day, as becometh Chri&s;tians&mdash;by Prayer and Thank&s;|giving; by Repentance for pa&s;t Sins, and Re&s;olutions of an Amendment of Life; by practi&s;ing the <HI>Duties</HI> of that Religion, for the <HI>Intere&s;ts</HI> of which you have mani|fe&s;ted &s;uch Zeal and Attachment; by laying a&s;ide all Malice, Hatred, and De&s;ire of Revenge; by commit|ting your Cau&s;e to the Ju&s;tice of God, and waiting with Re&s;ignation for the further Accompli&s;hment of his gracious De&s;igns. He who can <HI>&s;till the raging of the

Seas,</HI> knows be&s;t how to re&s;tore Peace and Tranquility to your di&s;tracted Country. May he correct the Hearts, and enlighten the Under&s;tandings of your infatuated Brethren, who &s;till refu&s;e to contribute their Endeavours towards healing the&s;e unhappy Di&s;putes. And while their Example proves a Warning to you,&mdash;while, in their Conduct, you con&s;ider the Exce&s;&s;es to which tho&s;e may be tran&s;ported, who once pa&s;s the ancient Bounds of lawful and &s;ettled Government, may God give you Grace to attach your&s;elves the more firmly to our happy Con&s;titution both in Church and State.</P>
<P>HUMBLY, and with all due pro&s;tration of Heart, I &s;hall venture to affirm that your Cau&s;e is his own. It is the Cau&s;e of Peace, Loyalty, and &s;ound Rea&s;on, expo&s;ed to the Attempts of mi&s;guided Men, whom he &s;eems to have given over to a Blindne&s;s of Heart that hurries them into all the Violence and Artifice of Sedi|tion, Frenzy and Rebellion. Fear not then, my Friends, but in his own Time <HI>his Wi&s;dom will order all Things &s;weetly.</HI> In the mean Time, learn to re&s;ign your&s;elves to whatever Means he may be plea&s;ed to employ for that End, and humble your&s;elves beneath his cha&s;ti&s;ing, but fatherly Hand. Would to God I could &s;ay that the Danger were pa&s;t! But Treachery perhaps, &s;till lurketh among&s;t you. Let every Man, therefore, be careful and vigilant. Nature requires, and Religion approves, that we &s;hould make U&s;e of the Means, which Providence hath put into our Power for our Protection and Safety. But let this be your chief Dependance, that he <HI>who is with you, is</HI> greater <HI>than they</HI> who are again&s;t you.&mdash;He from whom alone your Safety can come, <HI>neither &s;lumbers nor &s;leeps.</HI> Tho' your Enemies may hope <HI>that the Darkne&s;s &s;hall cover them, the Darkne&s;s is no darkne&s;s with Him.</HI> He will not let them <HI>have their De&s;ire,</HI> nor their <HI>mi&s;chievous Ima|gination pro&s;per.</HI> Let the Sen&s;e of the common Danger to which you are expo&s;ed, and the Fellow&s;hip of your pa&s;t Sufferings, &s;trengthen the Ties of Charity

between you, and bind you together as Friends and Brethren. Let a Reciprocration of Kindne&s;s and Hu|manity di&s;tingui&s;h you in this Sea&s;on of Di&s;tre&s;s, to &s;often the Rigour of each others Sufferings and lighten the univer&s;al Burthen of Affliction. Be of one Heart, and one Mind, cleave together,&mdash;commend your&s;elves to the Protection of God, and doubt not but he will com|plete the Work he hath already &s;o graciou&s;ly begun. And when he <HI>&s;hall have plucked out</HI> all Strife and En|mity from <HI>among</HI> you, fear not but he will <HI>return, and have Compa&s;&s;ion upon you, and bring you again every Man to his Heritage, and every Man to his Land.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST not fini&s;h as if I meant to di&s;appoint your Expectations, and not adopt a Conclu&s;ion which I am convinced you have already anticipated. The Al|legiance they had &s;worn to their lawful Sovereign, and an affectionate Attachment to his virtuous Cha|racter, compelled your Clergy to &s;hut the&s;e Doors, rather than omit the dutiful Addre&s;&s;es, which the Church enjoins them daily to offer to Heaven for his Safety. Let us therefore conclude the Service of this Day, when the Freedom of your Wor&s;hip is re&s;tored to you, by uniting together with one Heart, and one Voice; to implore the divine Favour and Protection for our Sovereign Lord, King George;&mdash;that God would be plea&s;ed to give him length of Days, and encrea&s;e of Happine&s;s&mdash;to pro&s;per all his Undertakings for the good of his People, and to ble&s;s him with what his Actions prove, and his Words a&s;&s;ert to be the
