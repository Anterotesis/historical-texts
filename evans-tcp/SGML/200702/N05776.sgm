<HEAD>THE MONSTER OF MONSTERS.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is hoped that the common idle Stories about <HI>Mon&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Prodigies,</HI> which amu&s;e and plea&s;e the Vulgar, while they di&s;gu&s;t &s;ober and rea&s;onable Men, will be no in&s;u|perable Objection again&s;t the en&s;uing Narrative: Tho' the Author is aware, that the Frequency of &s;uch Tales, which are &s;oon found to be de&s;titute of all Truth and Reality, will be a con&s;iderable Prejudice to it. But let its Reception be what it will, he thinks the Subject of it too &s;ingular and remarkable, to have no publick Notice taken of it. And in full Confidence, that the Truth will, at length, &s;urmount all Ob&s;tacles, and tri|umph over the mo&s;t determin'd Infidelity, he can chear|fully ri&s;que all the Credit he has in the World, whether more or le&s;s, upon the Verity of what follows.</P>
<P>THERE lately appeared, in this <HI>Metropolis,</HI> a MON|STER of the mo&s;t hideous Form, and terrible A&s;pect; &s;uch an one as was never before &s;een in <HI>America</HI> by any Man's Eyes; and, I believe, no where el&s;e; to be &s;ure not in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions. There was indeed one
<PB N="4" REF="007332_0003_102B5A1DD6C6A870">
formerly a little like him in <HI>Turkey:</HI> another in <HI>Italy</HI>; and, as &s;ome &s;ay, there is one in <HI>France</HI> at this Day. He had more Heads and Horns than any Bea&s;t de&s;cribed in the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e</HI>; and pu&s;hed more furiou&s;ly than the He-Goat in <HI>Daniel.</HI> His Teeth re&s;embled tho&s;e of an overgrown Lion: His Trunk was like that of an Elephant; the Protuberance on his Back, like that of a Camel; his Eye (for he had only one with all his Heads) was like that of <HI>Polyphemus</HI>; his Ears were of a much greater Longitude than tho&s;e of good <HI>St. Francis's traying Au|ditory</HI>: The Wings which came out of his Sides, were like tho&s;e of an Eagle: his Hair (or rather Feathers) was like <HI>Nebuchadnezzar's,</HI> after he was driven from among Men; his Claws, like tho&s;e of a Bear, only much bigger; and for a Tail, <HI>Gulliver's</HI> Monkey was a Fool to him.</P>
<P>FROM what Parts he was brought, I do not certainly know; and would not deceive the Reader by pretending to an Acquaintance with &s;uch Circum&s;tances as I am ignorant of. Some a&s;&s;ert that he came from the South; others, from the We&s;t; and &s;ome, from the Ea&s;t: But I rather think (if he were not brought forth among&s;t us) that he came out of the <HI>North</HI>; con&s;idering the Evils and the De&s;truction which his Appearance portended.</P>
<P>HE was fir&s;t &s;een here in a large A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Matrons</HI>; who, one would have thought, from their natural Timi|dity, mu&s;t have been univer&s;ally &s;hocked at &s;o tremend|ous a Sight. But (<HI>wonderful to relate!</HI>) they were, almo&s;t to a Woman, greatly plea&s;ed with the Creature: And though many of them were not pa&s;t the Age of Preg|nancy; yet I have not heard of a &s;ingle one that mi&s;car|ried; nor indeed of more than about half a Score that were even thrown into <HI>Hy&s;terick Fits.</HI> The far greater Part were &s;o &s;trangely captivated with this Mon&s;ter, that they fondled and play'd with him: and would even have
<PB N="5" REF="007332_0004_102B5A20A68294E0">
taken him into their Laps and Bo&s;oms, had he not been of too unweildy a Size. "What a pretty Lap-Dog, &s;aid one and another, would this Creature make, if he was not of &s;uch an enormous Bulk!" And a third even call'd him <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">k,</HI> as &s;he lean'd again&s;t his <HI>Probo&s;cis.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE few Ladies of better Ta&s;te, who &s;pake of him as an ugly, deformed, over grown Bea&s;t of Prey; and would have had him immediately turn'd out of the Hou&s;e, were cried out upon as having no Ta&s;te at all; and even threatned, that they &s;hould never come there again, to drink Tea and Coffee in &s;uch polite Company. It is thought that two Attornies Wives, be&s;ides &s;everal other Ladies of le&s;s Di&s;tinction, would have admitted him, had he been of an amorous Turn, like <HI>Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">s</HI> and the <HI>Satyrs,</HI> to &s;ome Familiarities not &s;o fit to be mention'd. <HI>Europa</HI> was never more enamour'd of a Bull; nor <HI>Leda,</HI> of a Swan: and both of them had certainly a far ju&s;ter Ta&s;te than the&s;e modern Ladies. He was even voted, in Form, by them, who ought to be the be&s;t Judges of Beau|ty, to be the prettie&s;t, hand&s;ome&s;t Creature, they had ever laid their Eyes upon, in all their Lives.</P>
<P>THIS A&s;&s;embly of Matrons, not content with admir|ing the Mon&s;ter them&s;elves, took great Pains, both by Care&s;&s;es, and Threats, to gain others over to their odd Opinion. They decorated him with Ribbands and Gar|lands, like an ancient Victim, or rather like an <HI>Egyptian</HI> God, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Prie&s;te&s;s to be mention'd hereafter: and having fir&s;t done Homage to him them|&s;elves on bended Knees; &s;ent him in that Dre&s;s, to ano|ther Company of Ladies, who u&s;ed to meet to dance, and to regale them&s;elves, at no great Di&s;tance from their own A&s;&s;embly-Room.</P>
<P>THOSE of the Club, who were ordered to e&s;cort him thither, came and &s;aid; "Behold here, Ladies, one of
<PB N="6" REF="007332_0005_102B5A2353713FC8">
the mo&s;t lovely, charming, adorable Creatures, that ever your Eyes were laid upon! Pray, good Ladies, join with us in our Admiration, and &s;hare our Plea&s;ure. O! the Beauty of the dear Creature! See how he looks! View him all over critically and exactly! Who ever &s;aw the like!&mdash;For the Entertainment and Delight of the Publick, (and in order to put Money into our own Cof|fers, to game with &amp;c. when our Hu&s;bands are out of Humour) we have re&s;olv'd to hire a great Number of Per&s;ons to carry him thro' the Country for a <HI>Sight.</HI> So good a Show will certainly give infinite Plea&s;ure to People of every Rank; at the &s;ame Time that it will bring in Ca&s;h enough to find us all, in Tea, and Coffee, in Equipages and fine Clothes, in Citron Water and gaming Money, as long as we live. Come, dear Ladies, ca&s;t in your Lot among us, and let us go Snacks! We &s;hall all find our <HI>Profit</HI> in it; and others, their <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Amu&s;ement.</HI>"</P>
<P>MANY of this latter A&s;&s;embly were as marvellou&s;ly plea&s;ed with the <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> as tho&s;e of the former; and &s;oon expre&s;&s;ed their Readine&s;s to concur the Motion, for carrying him about for a Show. But a middle-aged Gentlewoman of a more refined Ta&s;te, and who was both in Stature and Judgment, Superiour to mo&s;t, even of the other Sex, &s;tood up; and &s;pake to this Purpo&s;e. "What <HI>Demon</HI> has gotten Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of you, my dear Ladies! and deprives you of your Sen&s;es to &s;uch a De|gree, as to make you take this filthy Mon&s;ter for a Beauty! I am afraid to come near him, lea&s;t he &s;hould hook up my Petticoats, and rip up my Stays, if nothing wor&s;e! And how he whi&s;ks his na&s;ty Tail in your Faces, at many Yards di&s;tance! Mercy on us! This a Beauty! Look on tho&s;e Ears! See that plaguy hump Back! View that bloody, ferocious Eye; if you can look &s;teadily upon it! See tho&s;e diabolical Horns! Look on that triple Row of <HI>Ivory,</HI> in each of his enormous Jaws! And how he "Grins horribly, a gha&s;tly Smile!" Ob&s;erve
<PB N="7" REF="007332_0006_102B5A24D7442D40">
his Feet, how they are Cloven; branching out into five or &s;ix Claws, of huge Length and Thickne&s;s! A pretty Creature, upon my Con&s;cience, for Women to be taken with! How much better you like <HI>Horns,</HI> than your Spou&s;es do? This a Creature, to be carried about the Country for an agreable Spectacle! And becau&s;e you are run mad, for&s;ooth! we mu&s;t run mad to keep you Company; or el&s;e fall under your Di&s;plea&s;ure! No truly! I like not your fancy; nor this &s;trange Propo&s;al! If you &s;hould &s;end this more than <HI>Cerberian-mouth'd</HI> Mon&s;ter through all the Towns in the Province, take my Word for it, you would rather fright the Inhabitants out of them, than draw Spectators about him. And tho' you expect to get &s;o much Money by this Show, I am much mi&s;taken if you would get enough to defray the Charges of carting it about. People will rather conclude you &s;end a Mon&s;ter to devour and de&s;troy, than a Spectacle to entertain and delight, them! Fye upon it, Ladies! What evil Spirit put this Notion into your Heads; and deludes you at &s;uch a Rate! To be plain with you, you had far better hire a Score or two of the &s;turdie&s;t Butchers in the Town, to kill this horrible Creature out-right, before he does any Mi&s;chief; and to throw him, Piece-meal, into the Dock, than run the Ri&s;que of keeping him alive a &s;ingle Day. What would become of us all, if he &s;hould break his Chain, get out of his Cage, and range about at large, &s;eeking whom to devour! Doors and Locks, and Bolts, and Bars, would be no Security again&s;t him. He (having a Faculty of contracting and enlarging him&s;elf at Plea&s;ure) would ea&s;ily climb into our Bed Chambers; and tho' we &s;hould hide our&s;eves down in our <HI>Wine Cellars</HI> among the <HI>Ca&s;ks</HI>; he would find us out even there; drag us into Day Light, and gorge him&s;elf with our mangled Carca&s;es! A pretty Creature to be kept for a Show, truly! Thus &s;pake Mrs. GRACCHA; for that was the Name of this accompli&s;h'd Lady.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007332_0007_102B5A26683B60A0">THIS Speech was &s;oon &s;econded and thirded by other Ladies of great Merit Madam CORNELIA in particular, (an open, plain-hearted Lady; and in high E&s;teem, tho' <HI>low of Stature</HI>) among&s;t other Things very pertinent to the Occa&s;ion &s;aid; "Well! I am equally &s;urprized, Ladies, at your Ta&s;te and at your Judgement. I wonder you can imagine that &s;uch a Spectacle as you propo&s;e, can be reli&s;hed by the People of this Country; or that any good can come of this Project. Are you really in earne&s;t, Ladies! Why! Do you not remember, when a <HI>Leopard</HI> only was carried about for a Show, a few Years &s;ince, what Confu&s;ion and Terror People were thrown into! Not only tho&s;e of our own Sex; but the Men al&s;o; even &s;ome of the <HI>Military</HI> Order! Was not the Con&s;ternation &s;till greater, and more univer&s;al, when the <HI>Lion</HI> was carted about, &s;ome Time before? What terrible Apprehen&s;ions had People of his breaking from his Durance, and eating them half up! And more lately, when there was only a <HI>Wild-Cat</HI> of uncommon Size and fiercene&s;s, and longer Fangs than u&s;ual, carried from Place to Place; you have not, &s;urely, forgot how precipitately even &s;uch brave, valiant Men as C&mdash;pt&mdash;ins and C&mdash;ll&mdash;n&mdash;ls fled before it; leaving the Towns where they re&s;pectively lived, upon the fir&s;t News of its approach! The Courage of &s;uch Gentle|men, was never doubted by any one; And it is certain they would have &s;ingly encountered the whole Rebel Army in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with the <HI>Pretender</HI> at its Head! But the People of this Country, I &s;ay, cannot endure <HI>wild Bea&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Lawle&s;s Devourers!</HI> How then, Ladies, in the Name of Amazement, can it enter into your Thoughts, that they will be delighted with a Mon&s;ter! e&s;pecially &s;uch an huge, dreadful one as this; which might devour half a Country Village for a Breakfa&s;t; and be hungry &s;till! Will they give their Money freely, do you think, for &s;uch a Show! When you reflect, Ladies, upon the Abborrence and Dread which they have of all <HI>wild Creatures</HI>; of all <HI>Bea&s;ts of Prey</HI>; when you con&s;i&s;ter how contrary &s;uch
<PB N="9" REF="007332_0008_102B5A27ECB81308">
Shews are to their natural Ta&s;te, Genius and Manners; when you con&s;ider farther, what Mi&s;chiefs may be actu|ally done by this dreadful Creature; I &s;hall think you ought to drink no Tea, except &s;uch as is made of <HI>Helle|bore,</HI> if you per&s;i&s;t in the project of carrying about this Creature; a Mon&s;ter, as much more formidable than a <HI>Lion,</HI> as a <HI>Lion,</HI> than a common <HI>Puppy-Dog</HI>!"</P>
<P>THESE two Speeches, together with &s;ome others, were very attentively heard by the Club: And, in &s;hort, made &s;o good an Impre&s;&s;ion, that the major Part adopted the Sentiments of them; and rejected the Motion of the other Club, after due Deliberation. Whereupon tho&s;e who pre&s;ented the Mon&s;ter to them for their Approba|tion, returned with him to their own Si&s;terhood, in great Wrath and Indignation for this imaginary Affront; and endeavoured, <HI>Thale&s;tris-like,</HI> to inflame the Pa&s;&s;ions of the A&s;&s;embly; which they found no very hard Ta&s;k to per|form. The greater Part being now well heated with Anger; &s;ome with laced Tea, others with Gin, and &s;ome with Citron Water; they came to a Re&s;olution to &s;end the Mon&s;ter immediately back again, with another Me&s;|&s;age; giving out their Menaces, concerning what they would do to any Lady of the other Si&s;terhood, who &s;hould be &s;o hardy as to reject their Propo&s;al a &s;econd Time. "My Word for it, &s;ays one, that Lady that &s;hall dare to open her Lips in di&s;paragement of this rare, curious, lovely Animal, &s;hall have her Pinners torn off her Head; and her Sack &s;tripped over her Ears!" "And my Word for it, &s;ays another, although they pretend to be at lea&s;t our Equals, if not our Superiours; and to have as good a Right as we, to enjoy their own Opinion about the Beauty and Deformity of any Creature living; yet we will make them know the Difference, I warrant you! We are the mo&s;t numerous Club; and will &s;oon cau&s;e them to &s;ub|mit to our Determination; or pull all their Caps and Ruf|fles off! Do they call this, a Mon&s;ter? a dangerous Mon&s;|ter,
<PB N="10" REF="007332_0009_102B5A2B3384EB48">
nor fit to be kept alive! I &s;ay again, we will have him carried about for a Show, let them &s;ay what they will: And they &s;hall join with us too in this Project, or we'll know why; and that's more!"</P>
<P>THE Mon&s;ter's greate&s;t Admirers in this A&s;&s;embly, were (1) Madam RIXA; formerly a lean, poor Gen|tlewoman, thought to be in a Con&s;umption; and who u&s;ed to go very meanly clad: But of late Years, plump|ed up to a con&s;iderable Magnitude; and become a per|fect <HI>Belle,</HI> with her rich Lace and Ruffles; and almo&s;t every Female Ornament, excepting that of a meek and quiet Heart. Some idle People in&s;inuate, that &s;he got her Money by Gaming; and that &s;he never u&s;ed to play fairly: but I do not concern my&s;elf about &s;uch Matters.</P>
<P N="2">(2) MADAM PROTEA; a Gentlewoman that was lately &s;een in Publick with a remarkable <HI>Head Dre&s;s.</HI> This Lady has many good Qualities: but is very variable and incon&s;tant in every Thing; &s;o that it was expected her Pa&s;&s;ion for the Mon&s;ter, would have been but &s;hort-lived. However, to the Surprize of every one, She, who never u&s;ed to be of the &s;ame Mind two Days together, has, in <HI>this</HI> Re&s;pect, &s;hown all the Steadine&s;s and Per&s;e|verance of a <HI>Saint</HI>; continues to extol the Beauty of the Mon&s;ter, and &s;eems determin'd to live and dye in the Faith of his Charms.</P>
<P N="3">(3) ANOTHER of his great Admirers was Madam RUTI<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">A, the Wife of a very fine, hand&s;ome Gentleman: to find whom making Panegyricks, with &s;o much Zeal upon &s;uch an ugly Creature, was a Surprize to all: e&s;pecially when this Zeal carried her to &s;peak even of her own aged Mother, with le&s;s Decorum and Re&s;pect than became her. For the good old Lady happening to be her Tenant, &s;he threatned that &s;he would turn her out, if &s;he did not approve her Pa&s;&s;ion. The Gentlewoman of
<PB N="11" REF="007332_0010_102B5A2D6640FBE8">
whom I am now &s;peaking, is &s;ingularly plain and mode&s;t in her Dre&s;s; commonly appearing abroad in a dark Ru&s;|&s;el Gown. She is a Lady of real and great Worth; but ought certainly to have been a better Judge of Propriety and Decency, as well as of Beauty and Deformity, than to have &s;pake and acted in the Manner &s;he did.</P>
<P N="4">(4) Mrs. AQUATICA (a jolly-looking, pur&s;y Gentle|woman; and a little a&s;thmatical) was al&s;o a great Ad|mirer of the Mon&s;ter; nur&s;ing it with much Tenderne&s;s, and a peculiar Fondne&s;s. Nor is this &s;trange, if, as &s;ome have hinted, &s;he was the real <HI>Mother</HI> of it; though by Means of an unlawful Commerce. But whether this be Fact, or not; and if it is, whether the Mon&s;ter i&s;&s;ued from her Head, as <HI>Pallas</HI> did from the <HI>Thunderer's,</HI> ac|cording to the <HI>Pagan</HI> Mythology, or whether it dropped from her Belly, as the unformed <HI>Cub</HI> falls from the prowl|ing, ravenous Bear's; I confe&s;s my&s;elf unable to deter|mine. Nor is it very material, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be her Offspring, whether the Foetus was originally conceived in her Brain, or Belly; &s;ince a le&s;s mon&s;trous Production could not have been rationally expected from either; nor a more perfect from the one than from the other. This Matron was the Wife of a certain great <HI>Farmer</HI> living out of the Town; who had many Tenants under him; and it is &s;aid, he was wont to treat them with &s;uch Severity, Haughtine&s;s and In&s;olence, e&s;pecially in gathering in his Rents, that he has often been in Jeopardy of a broken Pate. But it is not the Hu&s;band, but the Wife, gentle Reader, that we have now to do with. She, as was hinted before, was at lea&s;t the Nur&s;e, if not the Mother of the Mon&s;ter. And though &s;he has &s;o liberally given Food and Nutriment to it, yet &s;he expects, in her Turn, to receive Nouri&s;hment from it. For although I &s;ome|times &s;peak of this Creature, as being of the <HI>Male</HI> Gen|der, I would now acquaint the Reader, that it is really an <HI>Hermaphrodite</HI>; and has a Multitude of large Teats;
<PB N="12" REF="007332_0011_102B5A2F13CE3890">
at which many hope to hang in Rows, like &s;o many &s;uck|ing Pigs, or rather like Imps at the Teats of Witches. Nor need I ob&s;erve here, what every one knows already, That though Mon&s;ters are &s;aid not to breed; yet they frequently <HI>give Milk</HI> in prodigious Quantities. But then it takes the Produce of a whole Country to feed one. And indeed, if this &s;hould live, I fear we &s;hall find the old Proverb concerning the <HI>Sterility</HI> of Mon&s;ters, erro|neous.</P>
<P N="5">(5) ANOTHER of the&s;e Mon&s;ter-loving-Matrons, was Madam CAPILLA; a very &s;leek, &s;oft-&s;poken, double-tongu'd, ro&s;ey Gentlewoman; though, I think, &s;omewhat older than either of the other. She was formerly the Wife of a Prie&s;t of <HI>Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and her&s;elf a Prie&s;te&s;s. For which Rea&s;on, as &s;ome &s;ay, &s;he was employed to u&s;her this Mon&s;ter into the World, with all the Pomp and Ceremonial, practis'd by the Pagan Hierarchy: Tho' &s;he had not, for many Years pa&s;t, concerned her&s;elf much about Religion in any Shape; but given her&s;elf up to Matters meerly worldly and &s;ecular, <HI>at the be&s;t.</HI> However, &s;ince the Sacerdotal Character is indelible, (although the Office is pro&s;tituted ever &s;o much, or even wholly renounced) a more proper Per&s;on, certainly, could not have been pitched upon to perform the &s;aid Rites, con&s;idering for what Creature they were to be performed!</P>
<P N="6">(6) A <HI>younger</HI> Lady than either of the former, was a con&s;iderable Admirer of, and a warm Advocate for, the Mon&s;ter. She is remarkable for a Chin, &s;omewhat immoderate in Length; and wears both <HI>Night</HI> and <HI>Day</HI> a very large <HI>Beauty Spot</HI> upon her right Cheek: In which there is this farther ob&s;ervable, that it is very difficult to take it off, without taking the <HI>Skin</HI> away with it! This Lady was very lately in high E&s;teem in the Town: And although her Conduct with Relation to the Mon&s;ter, has been exceptionable; yet it is not doubted but that Time,
<PB N="13" REF="007332_0012_102B5A31CC226E18">
and a circum&s;pect Behaviour, will re&s;tore a Lady of &s;o many laudable Qualities, to her former Reputation.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) Mrs. BIDDY brings up the Rear of all the&s;e Ladies; and Claims a very particular Notice. She is the Wife of a certain valiant C&mdash;ll&mdash;n&mdash;l; and, in Imitation of him, wears a great Tuft of Feathers on the top of her Head; &s;o weighty, that it is thought to have over&s;train'd, and weaken'd, that tender Part; and made her a little giddy.

She has the Misfortune to have a very &s;ly, cunning, <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Look; and not being of the faire&s;t Complexion, nor able to look a good Chri&s;tian in the Face; &s;ome have &s;u&s;pected her to be of <HI>that Religion</HI>; and hinted, that the only Rea&s;on why &s;he is not conformed to 'its whole Ritual, is her <HI>Sex.</HI> Yea, many are very confident, that &s;he is an I&s;r...I...te.. ind...d..... bating this &s;ingle Branch of the Character, that in &s;uch Per&s;ons there is <HI>no Guile.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I could not help entertaining &s;ome Su&s;picions of this Sort, my&s;elf, upon a certain Occa&s;ion; tho' I would not be uncharitable. For happening to dine with her &s;ome Time ago, at a Country-Inn, where we had nothing &s;erved up, but one Di&s;h of roa&s;ted Pork and Partridge together; I ob&s;erved, Mrs <HI>Biddy</HI> &s;eemed to love Partridge very well; but would not touch a Mor&s;ell of the Pork: tho' &s;he greedily took a large Sop made of the Dripping. And what &s;eemed to enter into her there|with, I chu&s;e not to &s;ay!</P>
<P>THERE are others who have &s;u&s;pected Mrs. <HI>Biddy</HI> of being a follower of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>: But, in my Opinion, with far le&s;s Rea&s;on. For whereas the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religion forbids its Votaries to u&s;e the Fruit of the Vine, &s;he is a great Admirer of it: And is known to have &s;pent the the <HI>whole Afternoon</HI> of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Sabbath,</HI> over her Bottle.

<P>THE Mon&s;ter was &s;ent back almo&s;t In&s;tantaneou&s;ly, as it had been determin'd. Many Ladies of fine Ta&s;te and great Merit, belonging to that Club which rejected the Motion of the other, (and which I call the Club &s;uperi|our for di&s;tinction &s;ake) had been ab&s;ent from it for &s;everal Days. The good Lady al&s;o, who had lately &s;aid &s;o much in derogation from the Glory of the Mon&s;ter, had by this Time left the Company, to look after her Hou&s;e|hold Affairs. Some others, of her Opinion, had al&s;o done the &s;ame; and &s;ome had ab&s;ented them&s;elves through Cowardice. Some of <HI>this Si&s;terhood</HI> who were pre&s;ent, were intimidated by the Threats of the <HI>other</HI>: And &s;ome, it is &s;aid, were turned from their former Opinion, chiefly by the Efficacy of <HI>laced Tea,</HI> and <HI>Citron Water</HI>; with which they were plentifully regaled, at the Co&s;t of tho&s;e who labour'd their Conver&s;ion. So that, in &s;hort, when this grave Si&s;terhood came to Vote a &s;econd Time, it was
<PB N="15" REF="007332_0014_102B5A36EBA60E98">
carried in favour of the Mon&s;ter by a &s;mall Majority; to the great Joy and Triumph of all that w-r&s;h-ped the Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>IN that which I call the Club &s;uperiour, (tho' the lea&s;t in Number) &s;everal Ladies &s;ignalized them&s;elves in Fa|vour of the Mon&s;ter, &s;ome by their Craft and Subtlety, others by their Weakne&s;s and Simplicity.</P>
<P>Madam MARINA (a tall Lady) who had often cro&s;s'd the Ocean, and who was even when pa&s;t her <HI>grand Cli|macteri,</HI> in <HI>an hone&s;t Way,</HI> a true Votary to the Godde&s;s which &s;prang from the <HI>Briny Element</HI>; Madam MARINA I &s;ay, declared &s;he would not have been for keeping this Mon&s;ter alive, and exhibiting him as a publick Spectacle, had &s;he thought <HI>her</HI> Vote would have contributed to it, or been of any Efficacy towards getting a Majority of Voices on that Side. For &s;he knew there were enough without it.&mdash;</P>
<P>Madam CHEMIA, (a very philo&s;ophical Lady) who &s;ome Years &s;ince (as is well known) di&s;cover'd that <HI>pre|cious Stone,</HI> of which the Royal Society has been in que&s;t a long Time, to no Purpo&s;e; Madam CHEMIA, I &s;ay, argued in Favour of the Mon&s;ter, only becau&s;e &s;he tho't that the Publick would be hugely delighted and edified with &s;o curious a Show.</P>
<P>SHE &s;aid there was not a real <HI>Virtuo&s;o,</HI> a true <HI>Adept,</HI> in all <HI>North America,</HI> but what would come to &s;ee it; "and the Populace, you know, &s;aid &s;he, are always fond of Novelties and &s;trange Sights." This was <HI>her</HI> Motive. So that it is very malicious in any to in&s;inuate, as &s;ome have done, that Madam CHEMIA was on that Side of the Que&s;tion, for fear of being turn'd out of the Club. And indeed every one knows, that this good Lady never baulk'd or wrong'd her Judgment, to curry Favour either with Great or Small, Male or Female.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="007332_0015_102B5A387B5DA990">ONE Mi&s;s POLLY, was al&s;o a Favourer of the Mon&s;ter; &s;o far, I mean, as to give her Voice on that Side: Tho' I am credibly inform'd, that &s;he now fully vindicates her Ta&s;te and Conduct, by &s;olemnly averring, that &s;he held up her Hand quite contrary to her own <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Con|&s;cience.</HI> And for how many others in both Clubs, the &s;ame convincing and &s;atisfactory Plea might &s;erve, I pre|tend not to know! This Mi&s;s POLLY is a young, dap|per, &s;pruce, coquetti&s;h Lady, and trips along the Streets like any Thing! But as young and airy as &s;he is her&s;elf, &s;he has of late Years affected to keep very <HI>&s;edate</HI> Company: and &s;he was actually at con&s;iderable Expence to get ad|mitted a Member of this grave Club; wherein every one is now &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee &s;uch a blooming La&s;s, and in which there are &s;undry Matrons that are <HI>very old.</HI></P>
<P>BUT not to digre&s;s too far from my Mon&s;ter..... All the People in Town, exclu&s;ive of the&s;e two Female A&s;&s;em|blies, and the <HI>Blacks,</HI> &s;tood agha&s;t; and hourly expected when the terrible Creature would break loo&s;e, and devour them.

<P>THE Ladies who idoliz'd the Bea&s;t, and had already receiv'd his Mark in their tender, impre&s;&s;ive Foreheads, now thought their Point gained; and di&s;cover'd their Joy in a Way &s;omewhat too boi&s;terous, perhaps, to be very be|coming that &s;oft and delicate Sex. However, there was one Ob&s;tacle yet in their Way. The large Hou&s;e, where they u&s;ed to hold their Club, belonged to a Gentleman, <HI>without</HI> who&s;e <HI>Approbation</HI> they did not <HI>incline</HI> to do any Thing of Con&s;equence. Nor were they out of the Way, in paying &s;o great a Deference to his <HI>Opinion.</HI> For tho' he was only a <HI>private</HI> Gentleman (&s;u&s;taining no <HI>Office</HI> in

the Government, whether Civil or Military) he was a mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Per&s;on; a Gentleman of a good De&s;cent, and of a fine, as well as learned Education. He had travelled through many Countries in <HI>Europe</HI>; and im|proved him&s;elf in them all. His Genius was &s;trong; his Knowledge of Men and Things exten&s;ive; his Ta&s;te ex|act, his Addre&s;s winning; his Conver&s;ation equally im|proving and entertaining. With the&s;e Qualities, it is not &s;trange that he was acceptable to the Ladies, as well as to the Gentlemen; e&s;pecially con&s;idering he excell'd in <HI>dancing</HI>; tho' this I reckon among&s;t the lea&s;t con&s;iderable of his Accomplishments. This Gentleman, though he was always backward to contradict the Ladies in any Thing, had dropped a Word or two, intimating his Di&s;|approbation of what had been propo&s;ed; and what was indeed now re&s;olved upon. This came to the Ears of the Ladies, who could hardly believe it. It was therefore unanimou&s;ly determin'd, to refer the Matter, in a formal Manner, to Him: And they <HI>obliged them&s;elves</HI> beforehand, tho' they were very much &s;et upon the Thing, to <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> entirely to his Judgment; and follow his Advice.</P>
<P>THEY accordingly laid the Ca&s;e before him, in Pre|&s;ence of the <HI>Mon&s;ter</HI>; with many Encomiums on his Beauty, &amp;c. The Gentleman (tho' he was naturally en|dow'd with great Magnanimity) did not chu&s;e to venture into the Hall, where the Bea&s;t was, without taking a large Spear in his Hand. And &s;tanding in the mid&s;t, he acco&s;t|ed the Ladies thus <HI>verbatim.</HI></P>
<P>"Ladies, &s;aid he, I am extremely obliged to you for the <HI>Compliment</HI> you are plea&s;ed to pay to my Ta&s;te and Judg|ment; tho' I am not le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed at <HI>your own.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I have had &s;ome Knowledge both of Men, and of Bea&s;ts.

Are the good Peo|ple of this Country to be kept in <HI>bodily Terror</HI> by a Brute? by the mo&s;t deform'd of all Brutes! &s;uch an one as nei|ther they, nor their Grandmothers, ever &s;tar'd at! &s;uch an one as the Mon&s;ter-breeding-<HI>Nile</HI> never produced! They had rather combat Tygers at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI>; or the <HI>Afri|can</HI> Mon&s;ter, that made &s;uch Havock with <HI>Regulus</HI>'s Army! They cannot endure the Thoughts of a total <HI>Exci&s;ion,</HI> by the voracious Jaws of this <HI>Dragon,</HI> this <HI>Ger|gon</HI>! this....... what &s;hall I call him? I can &s;carce for|bear plunging this Spear into his Heart, this very In&s;tant, without farther Ceremony; But Ceremony is what the Ladies always expect; and Men of Honour always u&s;e towards them. Nor will I tell you, that you have forgot the natural Softne&s;s and Delicacy of your Sex and <HI>Con&s;ti|tution,</HI> and are turn'd <HI>Amanons</HI> and <HI>Termagants,</HI> or el&s;e you could not be plea&s;ed with &s;uch a Spectacle. No! But I a&s;&s;ure you Ladies, that you will neither oblige the People, nor get much Money, by exhibiting &s;uch a Show! My Advice is, that you get the ingenious Mr. <HI>Hurd</HI> to engrave the Mon&s;ter on a Copper Plate; and di&s;per&s;e the Prints of him about the Country. If the Image and Su|per&s;cription <HI>plea&s;es,</HI> it will be Time enough then, to &s;end about the Original. Should you immediately &s;end about the Mon&s;ter, in <HI>propria per&s;ona,</HI> (excu&s;e a Latin Word or two Ladies, though you &s;hould not under&s;tand it) you would rai&s;e a Su&s;picion in People, that you had &s;ome bad De&s;ign not only upon their <HI>Pockets</HI>; but upon their <HI>Liber|ties</HI> and <HI>Lives.</HI> You would certainly &s;et them all to <HI>Swear|ing,</HI> except <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> and a few other very grave, &s;olid Folks: And Ladies always abhor Oaths! Be&s;ides, if the People once get to SWEARING, it is odds but they will al&s;o get to <HI>Lying,</HI> and <HI>perjuring</HI> them&s;elves! You are plea&s;ed in &s;hort to refer it to me, Ladies, whether you and they &s;hall be Happy or Mi&s;erable. I therefore re&s;olve, as
<PB N="19" REF="007332_0018_102B5A3FC1542A08">
far as in me lyes, that both &s;hall be <HI>happy</HI>; and think my&s;elf <HI>&s;o,</HI> in having a Thing of this Nature &s;ubmitted to my De|termination. You will excu&s;e my Freedom, Ladies; and do me the Ju&s;tice to believe, that I would gladly oblige you in <HI>every Way,</HI> except that of <HI>contributing to your Mi&s;ery.</HI> This I can never con&s;ent to, even tho' I &s;hould be &s;o un|happy as to incur your Di&s;plea&s;ure!"</P>
<P>THUS &s;pake the Friend of the Ladies, the Friend of all. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe their Looks during the Time of his Speaking; and after he had done; &mdash; the Joy that appeared in the Countenances of &s;ome, the Shame, Di&s;appointment, and Anger, that were vi&s;ible in the Faces of others. But the Rejoicing was univer&s;al through the Town, among&s;t People of all Ranks, when they found them&s;elves deliver'd from their former Fears. It was &s;urprizing to &s;ee, and is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s, the &s;udden Change that was produced in every Face: "Free|dom from all terrible Sights; a quiet Enjoyment of what we have, and NO MONSTERS!" was the univer&s;al Cry; and &s;till continues the mo&s;t common Health that goes round.</P>
<P>HAVING thus fini&s;hed my <HI>true</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> Narrative of the mo&s;t formidable Mon&s;ter, that was ever &s;een in this Land; I now beg leave to Congratulate my dear Coun|trymen, that we are not without an HERCULES! This Mon&s;ter is not indeed yet actually killed; but only bound in &s;trong Chains. Whether he &s;hall be quite demoli&s;hed, and &s;ent to his own proper Place, or whether he &s;hall be permitted to live, to cram his mercile&s;s and in&s;atiable Maw with our very Blood, and Bones, and Vitals; depends upon my good Country Men them&s;elves. He now only lives till they &s;hall plea&s;e to pa&s;s Sentence of Death upon him. And after what has been &s;aid, it would be an Af|front to their Under&s;tandings and Sen&s;es, &s;hould I go about, in a formal Manner to convince them, that it is not fitting and &s;afe that he &s;hould live, and be carried about from Place to Place, as the Women have propo&s;ed. You will all quickly &s;ee the ugly Portrait, the dreadful Picture, of this Animal. And when it is pre&s;ented to you, take
<PB N="20" REF="007332_0019_102B5A414AE2D998">
particular Notice of his <HI>Horns,</HI> his <HI>Teeth,</HI> and his terrible <HI>Claws</HI>: tho' even his Tail (as incon&s;iderable a Member as that is generally accounted in Animals) might prove a Be&s;om of De&s;truction. A &s;ingle Bru&s;h or Flap of it would &s;weep us away Dozens and Scores!</P>
<P>YOU will at once conclude, that this Dog of H&mdash;ll, ought not only to have his enormous Length of Ears and Tail dimini&s;hed; his Teeth pulled out, and his Claws paired, but that his very Head (or Heads rather; for they are many!) ought to be excis'd; I mean <HI>cut off.</HI> Or if that cannot be done, you will think he &s;hould be bound, at lea&s;t for one thou&s;and <HI>prophetick Years</HI>; and ca&s;t into the bottomle&s;s Aby&s;s; not to be &s;een again above Ground, till that term is expir'd, or till <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> &s;hall make their Appearance, &s;pringing &s;pontaneou&s;ly from the Slime and Filth of the Earth; according to a certain Learned <HI>Expo&s;itor!</HI> This Creature may indeed make a tolerable Show, in the nether Regions, among&s;t his Black cloven footed Brethren: (tho' I believe he would at fir&s;t &s;tartle even them) But certainly he ought not to be &s;een by any, that are yet out of the Place of <HI>Dragons!</HI></P>
<P>BUT when the true <HI>Effigies</HI> of this dreadful Crea|ture comes out; you will then be able, my loving Countrymen, to form an exact Idea of him. And after &s;eeing this Print, he that can de&s;ire to &s;ee the <HI>Original</HI>; or would willingly &s;uffer the Creature to be kept alive for a Show, would de&s;erve no better a Fate in my Opinion, than to become Food and Su&s;tenance for him; ju&s;t as Cats and Dogs and Monkeys and other inferiour Animals, are thrown to Lions to prey upon: Tho' it would of the two, be more honourable to Share the Fate of the&s;e con|temptible Animals, in falling a Sacrifice to the noble, renowned, <HI>hereditary Monarch</HI> of the <HI>Fore&s;t</HI>; than to be devoured by &s;uch an unheard of, up&s;tart, unlicked, mi&s;created Mon&s;ter! It is to be hoped that what has been &s;aid will have no Tendency to excite any undue Re&s;entment again&s;t the Ladies I have had Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of in this Nar|rative. Many if not all of tho&s;e Women, who were for

keeping this Creature for a Show, had doubtle&s;s a kind and generous Intention to gratify Peoples Curio&s;ity; not being aware of the Danger attending their Project, and of the fatal Evils that might follow from it. They were cer|tainly out in their <HI>own Ta&s;te</HI>; and under a great Mi&s;take about <HI>ours.</HI> But Errors of this Nature &s;hould be over|looked and forgiven: E&s;pecially if they are not ob&s;tinately <HI>per&s;i&s;ted</HI> in, but &s;ea&s;onably <HI>recanted.</HI> I would therefore, my dear Countrymen, conclude by earne&s;tly recommend|ing the&s;e Ladies to your <HI>be&s;t Affections</HI> (at lea&s;t tho&s;e of them that are either Widows or Maidens) and this I do the rather, becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who <HI>Love</HI> &s;uch pretty, well-proprtion'd, charming Creatures as WOMEN, not to hate MONSTERS.</P>

<P>ONE of his Journey-men, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in correcting the Pre&s;s, &s;oon put in his Oar: but rowed another Way. <Q>Well! <HI>for my Part,</HI> &s;aid he, I don't believe it is aim'd again&s;t the <HI>Pope;</HI> but again&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;tward Indians;</HI> them <HI>Dogs</HI> that are not willing we &s;hould enjoy our <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Liberties;</HI> but would eat us all up alive.

And &s;o the Ra&s;cal went on to make the mo&s;t groundle&s;s, &s;aucy Application of &s;everal Parts of it, that could be. I &s;tamp'd, and gave the <HI>Urchin</HI> a &s;evere Re|buke for his Pertne&s;s, and Impudence; charging him never to li&s;p &s;uch a Word again (e&s;pecially when he <HI>hawked it about</HI>) as he valued his two Ears! and &s;o came away.</P>
<P>AS I was going home, tho't I, if People go on gue&s;&s;ing and gue&s;&s;ing, applying and applying, at this Rate; and <HI>making</HI> Sen&s;es, where there was none <HI>before;</HI> what may they not come to at la&s;t! The wild, extravagant Fancies of &s;ome, may carry them to fix &s;uch an arbitrary Meaning to this idle Tale, as I almo&s;t &s;hudder to think of! and as would leave a Sting in the <HI>End</HI> of it!</P>
<P>NOW to prevent every Thing of this Sort, I think my &s;elf bound in Duty to declare, that my Narrative (like mo&s;t Tra|vellers Stories) has not one Word of Truth in it. There has not, to my Knowledge, been any <HI>Mon&s;ter</HI> in the Town; nor any Thing like a Mon&s;ter. There has nothing happened lately which could naturally give Occa&s;ion to &s;uch a Fiction; nor any Thing to which it can be ju&s;tly apply'd, in the Way of <HI>Alle|gorical</HI> Interpretation. And the Per&s;ons who &s;hall attempt this, mu&s;t be very &s;imple, or ill-natur'd; for it is merely a Work of Fancy and Imagination; of which there is neither <HI>Type</HI> nor <HI>Antitype.</HI> And having declar'd this, I think I may <HI>innocently</HI> let it &s;ee the Light, as a very <HI>harmle&s;s, toothle&s;s</HI> Production; wi&s;hing that all other Romancers and Story Tel|lers
<PB N="24" REF="007332_0023_102B5A4AA3F304A8">
had been as fair and ingenuous, to undeceive their Rea|ders, as &s;oon as they had fini&s;h'd their <HI>Lies!</HI></P>
<P>BUT if I mu&s;t open my whole Heart, as to my Views in writing this, (which I have not yet done) I &s;hall certainly ap|pear a little vain. For Ambition had &s;ome Share in this Production, as mean as it is. To tell the Truth, I have long de&s;ign'd to write the <HI>KNAVE's PROGRESS,</HI> in Imitation of the <HI>PILGRIM</HI>'s, by the excellent Mr. <HI>John Bunyan;</HI> And I tho't, that by exerci&s;ing my &s;elf a little in this fanciful, my&s;|tical Way of writing, I might execute that <HI>great</HI> Work the better when I &s;et my &s;elf about it. And you mu&s;t excu&s;e my Vanity, gentle Reader, if I tell you, that I am not without &s;ome Hopes of performing the Task in &s;uch a Manner, as may ren|der me not wholly unde&s;erving the Title of <HI>his Succe&s;&s;or</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">If this little Attempt in the <HI>Romantick</HI> Way, meets with due Encouragement from the Publick; I pro|po&s;e to &s;et about that <HI>large, voluminous</HI> Work alluded to, as &s;oon as Lei&s;ure will permit.</NOTE>. <HI>Homer</HI> wrote of <HI>Frogs,</HI> (an ugly Sort of Creature) before he wrote of Kings and the <HI>Trojan</HI> War. Even <HI>Gnats</HI> employ'd the Pen of <HI>Maro,</HI> before it immortaliz'd <HI>Mezentius</HI> and other <HI>Heroes. Milton</HI> wrote of the <HI>Wizzard-like, mon&s;trous Comus,</HI> before he wrote of <HI>fallen</HI> Men, and <HI>apo&s;tate</HI> Angels. Nor do I doubt but that the great <HI>Bunyan</HI> him&s;elf, wrote the <HI>Progre&s;s</HI> of &s;ome other Animals, perhaps of <HI>Mon&s;ters,</HI> before he wrote that of the <HI>Pilgrim.</HI> Tho' I acknowledge, that there are no Creatures in the World, &s;o di&s;&s;imilar as <HI>Pilgrims</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ters</HI>; &s;ince the former <HI>hurt</HI> and <HI>devour Nothing</HI>; the latter, <HI>EVERY THING</HI>!</P>
