<HEAD>A Narrative OF Jeremiah Meacham.</HEAD>
<P>THE Man that occa&s;ioned the Preach|ing of the En&s;uing Sermon, was Born at, or near <HI>Salem,</HI> and Lived there, and in &s;everal other places of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Province near half his Dayes, before he came into <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Colo|ny, where he Married and continued, until he was more than Forty Years Old.</P>
<P>Furni&s;hed with a good Natural Under&s;tan|ding, and a &s;trong Memory: Such a Religi|ous Education was be&s;towed upon him in his younger time, and &s;uch powerful influ|ences of the Spirit of God accompanied the Means of Grace enjoyed by him; that he appeared, in the Opinion of &s;ome, remarka|ble for his Religious Conver&s;ation, before he began to ca&s;t off Religion.</P>
<P>But when he had abandoned the Society
<PB N="ii" REF="039607_0003_10147DC97066A000">
of tho&s;e that were vi&s;ibly Godly, and be|came a&s;&s;ociated with &s;ome that were openly wicked (in <HI>Providence:</HI>) He quickly grew wofully indifferent about the things of God|line&s;s, and more and more inclinable unto the ways of wickedne&s;s; neglecting the Publick Wor&s;hip of God, Prophaning the Lords-Day, &s;peaking wor&s;e than he &s;hould have done about &s;ome of the Duties of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Yet when he came to be Ma&s;ter of a Family, (in <HI>Newport</HI>) he attended Family-Prayer (as he &s;aid) above a year; but afterward that was omitted, (as he told) by rea&s;on of &s;ome difference in his Fami|ly. Whatever he did about Clo&s;et Prayer.</P>
<P>Having for &s;ome time neglected the <HI>Re|ligious Ob&s;ervation of the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, he pretended &s;ome concernment about the Seventh Day, but never appeared con&s;cientious in ob&s;erv|ing that day; nor could he own, that he had renounced his Infant Bapti&s;m; nor had he worn off all the good impre&s;&s;ions, made on his Soul, by the Means of Grace afforded to him in his Child|hood.</HI> And all this while, he was generally e&s;teemed exemplarily exact in his Dealings, and punctual to his Promi&s;es, about his Worldly Affairs; He could boa&s;t among his Neighbours about this part of Moral Hone&s;ty: Tho' they could charge him too truly with &s;peaking too largely &s;ometimes in his Romantick Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>But he &s;eldom or never &s;eemed altoge|ther free from &s;ome terrible reflections up|on his Con&s;cience, for his Apo&s;ta&s;y from
<PB N="iii" REF="039607_0004_10147D95711AE088">
God. And it hath been thought that his Convictions about &s;ome Concerns of his Soul, mixed with &s;ome vexations about his Affairs in the World, brought him into a grievous hurry, which by degrees boil'd up into a &s;ort of a raging fury: And keeping out of the way of &s;uitable directions for his Soul, his troubles of mind grew &s;o intolerable, that he told &s;ome, <HI>that he was weary of his Life.</HI></P>
<P>And the Enemies of Souls doubtle&s;s were not wanting in their endeavours with him, to carry all things the wrong way. For he &s;aid, he was advis'd, <HI>To drink away his troubles; To kill his troubles of mind by drinking of Strong Drink to exee&s;s</HI>: And he owned, <HI>That he had tried &s;everal times, what this way would do; but he found by &s;ad experience, that this was not the right way to get ea&s;e, for the troubles of his mind returned as the Spirits of the Drink removed.</HI></P>
<P>Things grew &s;o uncomfortable with him, that he loved not Home; he thought that all his Neighbours looked &s;trangely upon him; he pretended that he feared &s;ome body de&s;igned mi&s;chief again&s;t him, and that he &s;hould be &s;lain. Every day &s;eemed unto him as it if would be the la&s;t day of his life: And he asked of others, <HI>if they knew of no contrivance again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P>The Day before he committed his Mur|ders, he appeared mightily di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, walk|ing about in a very great agony, a great part of that day, chu&s;ing to be at the Neigh|bours. But on the &s;aid day of his Murders, (22 <HI>d.</HI> 1 <HI>m</HI>) he got and &s;at upon his Hou&s;e,
<PB N="iv" REF="039607_0005_10147DCB8F5A9678">
with a Penknife in his hand, for &s;everal hours, if di&s;cour&s;ing &s;ometimes with tho&s;e that came near him, &s;eeming afraid &s;ome or other would hurt him; Others feared more that he would hurt him&s;elf; none &s;eemed much to fear that he intended any hurt to any body el&s;e. And he declar'd, <HI>that he would hurt neither Man, Woman nor Child, if they would let him alone.</HI></P>
<P>After he came down from his Hou&s;e top into his Chamber, he kept there mo&s;t part of the Afternoon of that day, until after Sun &s;et; and then his Wife, and her Si&s;ter, upon his invitation, going up to him, urging of him to go down with them, or &s;triving with him to keep him from hurting of him&s;elf; it &s;eems that then he &s;truck his Wife in her throat with his Pen-knife; and then &s;truck her and her Si&s;ter down with an Ax (that he had carried up, and he had al&s;o Charged his Gun; but made no u&s;e of that, in his Murders) how many blows he gave them, is not known: But the dreadful marks of &s;everal remained on their mi&s;erably man|gled Bodies.</P>
<P>When he had murdered them, he &s;tood watchfully upon his Guard, with his Ax in hand, threatning all that offered to come up Stairs; knock'd one man down with his bloody Ax. Others endeavouring to appre|hend him, by breaking up the Chamber Floor under him, &amp; the Roof over him; he laboured to defend him&s;elf, as if again&s;t the wor&s;t Enemies. And when they carried &s;ome Fire, flaming to light their way before them,
<PB N="v" REF="039607_0006_10147D97956F1F20">
he &s;natch'd away the Fire, and laid it among &s;ome combu&s;tible matter, and got ready more, and quickly kindled a great Fire in the mid&s;t of the Chamber, as if he cho&s;e ra|ther to Burn him&s;elf alive, and the deal Bo|dies with him than to be taken: but find|ing the Chamber quickly growing too hot for him, and he being very hot with con|&s;tant motion; he &s;prung out headlong at the Window among the People, that were now &s;urrounding of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>At &s;ome time or other, in the&s;e hurries it &s;eems, he had cut his own throat; but fear|ing that death would not come &s;oon enough that way, and finding that he could not bear burning to death; it was thought, he was willing to try, if he could da&s;h him&s;elf to pieces, by throwing him&s;elf out at the Win|dow; by which he al&s;o hurt his head, if no other part of his Body; but his Wounds were near healed, before he came to Dye.</P>
<P>After his Apprehen&s;ion, he &s;eemed for &s;ome time too &s;tupid and &s;ofti&s;h, and willing to palliate his Murders, pretending fear that others intended to Murder him; and that he did what, he did in an hurry.</P>
<P>And when he was carried next day to &s;ee the Murdered Bodies, he acknowledged that it was a &s;ad &s;ight; but none &s;eemed more unconcern'd at the &s;adne&s;s of the &s;ight than he, that had mo&s;t rea&s;on of all to be &s;adly concern'd at &s;uch an amazing Spectacle.</P>
<P>In the time of his Impri&s;onment, he re|mained too long wonderfully in&s;en&s;ible a|bout the mi&s;erable condition of his Soul,
<PB N="vi" REF="039607_0007_10147DCD2698A168">
yet mighty ready to re&s;ent provocations; whereof it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that he had enough. Too many per&s;ons coming to him, and &s;ome of them none of the be&s;t, nor up|on the be&s;t de&s;igns, very much hindered the well improvement of his flying time, to the be&s;t advantage: Notwith&s;tanding he &s;eemed under continual expectation that he mu&s;t dye for his Murders; and was de&s;irous of the Prayers and Coun&s;els, that he tho't might be for his benefit, and willing to Read and Hear good Books to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t, and ex|cite his Preparation for Death; but &s;eemed mo&s;t of all to prize the Holy Bible; and by degrees came to a better &s;en&s;e of his la|mentable Circum&s;tances, and frequently de|clared that he valued not this World, if he might be well prepared for a better; and was ob&s;erved &s;everal times in Pri&s;on to warn others that came near him <HI>to Shun tho&s;e wayes of Sins, that he had found pernicious to him&s;elf</HI>; and was mightily concern'd for the Welfare of his poor Children, <HI>that they might be bro't up in the fear of God, and brought under the wings and the bonds of the Covenant of Grace.</HI> The &s;till more hopeful tokens of a real work of Saving Grace upon his own heart would have been very de&s;irable; tho' he was not without repeated intreaties of Prayer, that he might be made thorowly &s;en&s;ible of his Wickedne&s;s, and prepared for Pardon thro' the Blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>At his Tryal, (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>D.</HI> 2 <HI>M</HI> 1715.) he could not deny the Murders, but pleaded, that he
<PB N="vii" REF="039607_0008_10147D99AF857F30">
was not him&s;elf, and &s;o knew not what he did, when he committed them. Though he could remember the circum&s;tances of the Murders. And his Neighbours generally thought that he knew what he was doing, notwith&s;tanding his being in &s;uch an hurry; none &s;eemed at any lo&s;t about his being brought in Guilty.</P>
<P>After his Condemnation (9 <HI>D.</HI> 2 <HI>M.</HI>) he &s;eemed more pen&s;ive and penitent than ever before, in all the time of his Impri&s;onment. Expre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ires to &s;ubmit to the Will of God, praying, that God would prepare him for his Will; de&s;iring the prayers, and the helps of others, for &s;uch Preparation; bewailing and lamenting his own mi&s;erable Condition, as well as the di&s;tre&s;&s;es occa&s;i|oned by him, unto his Relations; and par|ticularly unto his Aged Parents, and his lit|tle Children; for whom he de&s;ired not only the Compa&s;&s;ions of Heaven, but al&s;o the en|deavours of his Friends upon Earth, for the good of their Souls.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t night that he lived, he &s;eemed mo&s;t of all concerned about his Condition, mourning as if his heart were indeed ready to break; pouring out his &s;ighs and groans be|fore God; willing to hear his attendants read in good Books, and e&s;pecially in the Bible. Asking their Prayers for and with him, that he might be prepar'd for his approaching End.</P>
<P>As the time of his Execution drew near, he manife&s;ted no reluctancy to attend it; only he complained, that the time between
<PB N="viii" REF="039607_0009_10147DCF45965410">
the Sentence and his Death was very &s;hort; ben he was told, that it was much longer than what he allowed unto tho&s;e whom he had murdered, and that he had lived longer by near three weeks, than he would have &s;uffered him&s;elf to have lived, had he been left unto his own will.</P>
<P>He de&s;ired that God would furni&s;h him with Courage to Glorify his Name, and En|counter the Terrors of Death.</P>
<P>As he drew near to the Place of his Exe|cution, he &s;eemed mightily amazed; but &s;o recovered, as to utter &s;everal things, that were by &s;ome accounted con&s;iderable; &s;ome of them are pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>But in all the Expre&s;&s;ions that he uttered, when he came to Dy, he pretended unto no more hopes concerning the good State of his Soul, than what might be implied in his de|&s;ires of an ab&s;olute Re&s;ignation to the Will of God; with entire dependance on the free Grace, the Infinite Sovereign Mercy of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But now he is gone from among the Liv|ing; it becomes all the Living to hope the be&s;t they can concerning him, and to leave Secret Things with the Lord, to whom they belong; and to mind the revealed Will of God about their own Duty, for the good of their own Souls, and the Souls of others, whom they are yet capable of benefiting; and to make the be&s;t improvement they can of all &s;uch Tragical Examples, for their own advantage; and to learn by the harms of o|thers, to keep clear from the like harms, and
<PB N="ix" REF="039607_0010_10147D9BCE882F30">
make &s;ure about their own &s;ea&s;onable Pre|paration for the end of all the Living; and con&s;tantly remember the repeated and me|morable Admonition of our Ble&s;&s;ed Redee|mer, in Luke 13.3, 5. <HI>Suppo&s;e ye, that the&s;e who have &s;ufferd &s;o &s;ad things, are therefore greater Sinners than others. I tell you, no; but except you Repent, you &s;hall all likewi&s;e pe|ri&s;h.</HI> And,</P>
<P><Q>Oh! That all People might be Warn'd again&s;t needle&s;ly for&s;aking the Holy Or|dinances of God, and the faithful Emba&s;|&s;adours of Chri&s;t, le&s;t they run them&s;elves into more terrible di&s;tre&s;&s;es, than they can ea&s;ily imagine, among their Ungodly Com|panions, who will not be able to help them out of their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, when they have left God, and God hath left them.</Q></P>
<P>This poor man acknowledged in the time of his Impri&s;onment, that he had for&s;aken God, and God had for&s;aken him, and then every thing &s;eemed again&s;t him, and he wi&s;h'd, '<HI>Oh! that I had thought of any faith|ful Friend, to whom I could have been willing to have gone for advice, in the time of my Di&s;|tre&s;s.</HI> But he could own, that he lived &s;o, that he was afraid or a&s;ham'd of coming into the pre&s;ence of any &s;uch Friend. He bitterly bewailed his leaving the Means of Grace that he had enjoyed in his Youth.</P>
<P>And,
<Q>Oh! that all People might be warned again&s;t wickedly grieving the Holy
<PB N="x" REF="039607_0011_10147DD1A0426088">
Spirit of God, by Sinning again&s;t the light of their own Con&s;ciences; doing of tho&s;e ill things, that they know &s;hould not be done; or not doing tho&s;e good things, that they know &s;hould be done: For if the Holy Spirit goes from a Soul, then comes the Evil Spirit to that Soul; and when he comes, he will be a Spirit of Slumber, as long as he can, to keep the Soul &s;ecure in a &s;tate, and in &s;ome way of Sin: But when he can keep the Soul no longer &s;ecure, but the Soul mu&s;t, by &s;ome means or other be awakened, to &s;ee &s;ome|thing of its own forlorn Condition; then he will be a Spirit of Terror, and will fill the Soul, wherein he dwells, with terrible Di&s;tre&s;s, that may at length i&s;&s;ue in horri|ble de&s;pair.</Q>
This poor man could &s;ay, that he feared that he &s;hould be Damned at la&s;t; and thought &s;ometimes that he would &s;trive to be as wicked as the Devil could make him; and yielded to every de&s;perate Conclu|&s;ions about his own Soul, (as hath been re|ported) long before his Murders.</P>
<P>And,
<Q>Oh! That all People might be ef|fectualy warned again&s;t all beginnings of de|clen&s;ions from God; and to take heed, left there be in any of them, an evil heart of Unbelief, in departing from the Living God; le&s;t they find the Lord ca&s;ting them off for ever, and his Soul taking no plea|&s;ure in them. For when People begin to decline from God, and from Good, they know not where they &s;hall &s;top: They
<PB N="xi" REF="039607_0012_10147D9D538427A0">
know not what Mi&s;chiefs and Mi&s;eries they are apace running into; nor how &s;oon they &s;hall be overwhelmed with a&s;toni&s;hing De&s;olations.</Q></P>
<P>This poor man left this awful Warning with his Neighbours, and told them &s;everal times, that he could well remember, that when he began to ca&s;t off the Fear of God, and leave the practices of Godline&s;s, indul|ging him&s;elf in Evil Cour&s;es, he as little thought as any of them all, that he &s;hould &s;o &s;oon come to &s;uch a mi&s;erable End. <HI>Let them then, that think they &s;tand, take heed le&s;t the fall: And therefore Commit the keeping of their Souls to God, in Well-doing, as unto a Faithful Creator.</HI></P>

<P>TO under&s;tand the intention of any Text of Sacred Scrip|ture, it is frequently advan|tageous to con&s;ider the Oc|ca&s;ion of the Text, &amp; com|pare it with other Texts, and with the whole current of the Scripture.</P>
<P>The Occa&s;ion of this Text, we may learn
<PB N="2" REF="039607_0023_10147DDF930D3E38">
from the Title of the P&s;alm wherein we find it, compared with the eleventh and twelfth Chapters of the &s;econd Book of <HI>Samuel.</HI> There we find, that <HI>David,</HI> a man after God's own Heart, was left unto very infandous, horrendous Crimes: Not only execrable A|dultery, but al&s;o horrid Murder, and very ungodly endeavours to conceal tho&s;e Wick|edne&s;&s;es; were among his Crimes. The be&s;t of Saints may fall into the wor&s;t of Sins, if God leave them to them&s;elves. [Then what great Sins may gracele&s;s Sinners fall into, while under the power, and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Satan!] Yea, the be&s;t of Saints may con|tinue a long time under the guilt of their Sins, that they fall into: How long! <HI>David</HI> continued a long time under the guilt of his Crimes; it doth not appear that there was any evidence of any Repentance for his Wickedne&s;s, for a long &s;pace after his crimes were committed. But after a long time, the Lord &s;ent his Mini&s;ter, <HI>Nathan,</HI> to <HI>David,</HI> to convince him of his Wickedne&s;s, and to bring him to Repentance. It is very &s;ure, that Sinners will never think of repentance of Sin, or turning to God, if the Lord &s;hould not call, or look after them; Our fir&s;t Father <HI>Adam</HI> thought not of repenting of Sin, before the Lord call'd after him; and the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> thought not of repenting of his Sin, be|fore the Lord looked upon him. The God of all Grace in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with infinite Compa&s;&s;ion to mi&s;erable Sinners, calls after them, to repent and turn to him, from all their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, with hopes of Pardon
<PB N="3" REF="039607_0024_10147DAAE9CD2818">
for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t. Thus it is with all that live under the Go&s;pel: And God will certainly recover from their falls tho&s;e that are Saints indeed, He will not &s;uffer them to peri&s;h for ever in their Sins, how great and &s;ad &s;oever have been their falls. They &s;hall be recovered before they dye; So was <HI>David.</HI> When the Mini&s;ter of God had brought him to a &s;ight and a &s;en&s;e of his Wickedne&s;s, them <HI>David</HI> acknowledges that he had &s;inned. He acknowledged his Wickedne&s;s with a repent|ing Soul; God helping him to repent with brokenne&s;s of Heart; with an heart broken for Sin, and from Sin.</P>
<P>A Promi&s;e of Pardon is immediately pro|po&s;ed unto the repenting Sinner: <HI>The Lord hath put away thy Sin, thou &s;halt not dye.</HI> God is ready to bring home pardon to the truly Penitent. Sinners can't be more forward in repenting of their Sins, than God in pardon|ing of their Souls, and making them &s;en&s;ible of his pardoning mercy upon their expre&s;&s;ing of their unfeigned Repentance. <HI>Thou, Lord art Good, and ready to forgive, and plenteous in mercy to all that call upon thee, that call upon thee in truth.</HI></P>
<P>But after the Mini&s;ter of God had fini&s;hed his Me&s;&s;age from the Lord unto <HI>David,</HI> then <HI>David</HI> compo&s;ed this P&s;alm, for the u&s;e of the Church of God in all After-Ages. When &s;inful per&s;ons become repenting Sinners, they will be concerned for the Glory of God, and for the good of others They will be de&s;i|rous that God might be Glorified by them|&s;elves, and they will be willing to do all they
<PB N="4" REF="039607_0025_10147DE1B51E09A8">
can for the Glory of God, and they will be willing to excite others to Glorify God; and therefore to excite them to Repentance, that they may Glorify God. And they will be de&s;irous that their own Repentance may be as much known as ever their Wickedne&s;s hath been known. The Sin of <HI>David,</HI> was by the wonderful Providence of God brought into open view, before the World; &s;o that the Enemies of the Lord thereupon took occa&s;ion to bla&s;pheme the Holy Name of God. There|fore <HI>David</HI> was willing that his Repentance might be openly and publickly known, that God might be thereby Glorified; that his di&s;|honour might as much as po&s;&s;ible, be pre|vented; that if the People of God &s;hould be reproached, and &s;o the Name of God be di&s;honoured by any wicked People, twitting of Godly People, and telling of them. <HI>Ay, &s;ee what your</HI> David <HI>hath done, what dete&s;table Impie|ties he hath been guilty of, and how abominably wicked he hath been, yet he is one of your great Saints:</HI> The People of God might be able truly to reply, <HI>'Tis true, we cannot but own it with &s;hame and with grief, that</HI> David <HI>was guilty of great Sins again&s;t God. But we are al&s;o &s;ure, that he did truly repent of his great Sins: God gave him grace to repent, and to evidence his re|pentance before the World, we have an excellent P&s;alm of his own compo&s;ing upon that very occa&s;ion, that &s;hews that he was truly penitent.</HI> The fifty fir&s;t P&s;alm is an everla&s;ting te&s;timony to all Generations, that <HI>David</HI> was concerned to Glorify God, by evidencing of his Repentance.</P>
<P>This will be the di&s;po&s;ition of all true Pe|nitents:
<PB N="5" REF="039607_0026_10147DAD9A9A4998">
They will be de&s;irous, that all their godly Neighbours may be furni&s;hed with &s;uf|ficient evidences of their unfeigned Repen|tance for all their Wickedne&s;s, that they may be able to do &s;omething to &s;top the mouths of the bla&s;pheming enemies of the Lord, that are glad of any occa&s;ions to reproach his Ho|ly Name.</P>
<P>The &s;cope of repenting <HI>David</HI> in this P&s;alm, is to de&s;ire of God that his Sins might be all pardoned, and his Adultry and his Murder, and that he might be clean&s;ed from Original Pollution, and might be made &s;en&s;ible of the pardon of all his Sins, and prepared to prai&s;e God for the forgivene&s;s of his Wickedne&s;s; and he promi&s;es unto the Lord, that upon his comfortable apprehen&s;ion of the pardon of his &s;in, by the re&s;toring of the joy of the Holy Spirit unto him, he would endeavour to promote the Glory of God, by furthering the Conver&s;ion of other Sinners. And he &s;hews an earne&s;t de&s;ire for the Pro&s;perity of the People of God: He knew that he had exceedingly grieved them by his Mi&s;carriages, and he was concerned that they might &s;hare with him in his Con|&s;olations upon his Reconciliation with God&punc; <HI>Penitent Sinners that have grieved others by their Sins, will be de&s;irous that others may have occa|&s;ion to rejoyce in their Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>In our Context, we find the penitent Sin|ner declaring what would not &s;atisfy God for his offences. None of the Sacrifices ap|pointed by God in the Ceremonial Law, to be offered by his People, in their External
<PB N="6" REF="039607_0027_10147DE5A6F9C880">
Wor&s;hip, could &s;atisfy for the wrongs that were done by Sin to the Maje&s;ty of Hea|ven: The Wrath of God could not be pa|cified by them, nor could they remove the guilt of &s;in from the Soul of the Sinner. <HI>The blood of Bulls and of Goats could never take away Sins.</HI> This <HI>David</HI> fully under&s;tood, and he plainly declares to the World his firm belief, that none of the Levitical Sacrifices could make full &s;atisfaction to Divine Ju&s;t|ice for the &s;ins of any per&s;on but they had a re&s;pect unto &s;ome other thing. Then he declares what Sacrifices would be accepta|ble with God. <HI>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit.</HI> May not this principally re|fer unto our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who being made a Sacrifice unto the Divine Ju&s;tice, had his Spirit grievou&s;ly broken by the wrath of God, while he was offering up him&s;elf a Sacrifice for the Sins of his People? He could &s;ay before he came to dye, <HI>My Soul is exceeding &s;orrowful, even unto death</HI>; and when he came to dye, <HI>he poured out his Soul unto death.</HI> His very Soul within him was dreadfully broken by the Anger of GOD, which he endured for the &s;ake of his Peo|ple, that they might be delivered from the Wrath to come. And altho' he were the e|ternally beloved Son of God, yet appearing as the Surety for Sinners, the Wrath of God broke his very Spirit within him. And becau&s;e he was the Eternally Beloved Son of God, therefore he was the Sacrifice of God; a Sacrifice accepted with God, as well as appointed by God; Yea; he was
<PB N="7" REF="039607_0028_10147DB00CF283A0">
him&s;elf God, truly and really God. The ve|ry Per&s;on that was offered a Sacrifice for Sin, was God Tho' he &s;uffered only as Man, the Divine Nature being uncapable of &s;uf|fering, yet the Per&s;on that &s;uffered was truly <HI>God over all ble&s;&s;ed for ever:</HI> And &s;o the Sacri|fice of &s;uch an One, was of infinite value &amp; virtue, and for that rea&s;on might be &s;tyled, <HI>The Sacrifices of God.</HI> For, be&s;ure the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was of more value infinitely than all the other Sacrifices that were ap|pointed by God to be offered; He was the Antytipe of them all, and as good as ten hundred thou&s;and millions of &s;uch Sacrifices. Yea, infinitely better than all other Sacrifices. Thus being as good as all, better than all, he might be called <HI>Sacrifices.</HI> And he was a Sa|crifice of &s;uch value as to &s;atisfy for the &s;ins of all that will accept of him for their Sa|crifice, let them be never &s;o many Souls; &amp; he is a Sacrifice of &s;uch value, as to &s;atisfy for all their Sins, if they believe on him, let their Sins be never &s;o many; &s;o may the Son of God be &s;tyled, the <HI>Sacrifices of God. He is the Propitiation for the &s;ins of the whole World, both Jews and Gentiles, that believe in him as their Saviour</HI>; He is a Sacrifice for them all, for all their &s;ins. Yea, &s;uch is the &s;ufficiency of the Merit of the Sacrifice of the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, that if all the Sinners in the world would believe on him, there is merit enough in his Blood to &s;atisfy for all their &s;ins: Of &s;uch value is his Blood, and therefore might he be called the <HI>Sacrifices of God.</HI> His Spirit having been broken, he is the <HI>Sacrifices of

<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>ANSWER:</HEAD>
<P>To this we may an&s;wer; Six things mu&s;t be attended, and a &s;eventh mu&s;t not be o|mitted by the Penitent Sinner, that would have a broken Heart acceptable with the Glorious God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Let all peo|ple con&s;ider the things now to be offered; and certainly the poor Condemned Pri&s;oner, under a Sentence of Death, not likely to en|joy another Sabbath, before his pa&s;&s;age into the Eternal World, will reckon him&s;elf under peculiar Obligations to con&s;ider the&s;e things, to direct him to that brokenne&s;s of heart, that will be acceptable with God thro' Chri&s;t: <HI>Poor man, Hearing for your la&s;t, hear for your Life, your Life; The Life of your precious im|mortal Soul is concerned in what you are now hearing. And let all hear &s;o, that their Souls may live; Hear &s;o that you may find what you hear.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There mu&s;t be &s;ome</HI> ILLUMINATION <HI>of the Mind, where there is that brokenne&s;s of Heart that will be acceptable with God through Chri&s;t.</HI> The Under&s;tanding mu&s;t be enlightened if the heart be rightly broken. If the heart be never &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, oppre&s;&s;ed, Brui|&s;ed and broken by dreadful terrours&punc; by fearful horrours, by amazing affrightments,
<PB N="10" REF="039607_0031_10147DEE4A9A66B8">
by a&s;toni&s;hing expectations of the Wrath of GOD, ju&s;t ready to be poured down upon the Soul; yet if there be no light in the mind, the heart is not rightly broken; If the mind be full of darkne&s;s, there may be &s;ome &s;ort of brokenne&s;s of heart, but not that which will be acceptable with God. There|fore mu&s;t there be &s;ome illumination of the Under&s;tanding, to &s;ee &s;omething about tho&s;e Truths of God, that will &s;hew why the heart of a Sinner &s;hould be broken. The broken hearted Sinner will have &s;ome under&s;tanding and con&s;ideration about the righteou&s;ne&s;s and the holine&s;s of God, about the odiou&s;ne&s;s and heinou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in, about the ju&s;tice and the &s;trictne&s;s of the Law of God, that is broken by &s;in; about the certainty of the threatnings of the Law of God again&s;t &s;in, about the dreadfulne&s;s of the puni&s;hment threatned for &s;in, by the Law, and about the unavoidable|ne&s;s of the puni&s;hment threatned, without full &s;atisfaction to the Law, which cannot be without a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s every way an|&s;wering the Law; but no &s;uch righteou&s;ne&s;s can he had be&s;ides the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; nor can this Righteou&s;ne&s;s be had without faith in Chri&s;t; and where there is true &s;aving faith in Chri&s;t, there mu&s;t and will be unfeigned repentance that breaks the heart for, and from &s;in Such as the&s;e things mu&s;t have &s;ome con&s;ideration in the Penitent Sinner, that will have his heart &s;o broken, as to be accepted with God: There|fore mu&s;t there be not only &s;ome acquain|tance with the Law of God, but al&s;o &s;ome
<PB N="11" REF="039607_0032_10147DB3AD09C130">
con&s;ideration what that Law requires, and what that Law forbids: Thence might the Penitent &s;ay, as in Rom. 7.7. <HI>I had not known &s;in, but by the law; by the law is the knowledge of &s;in.</HI> Sinners mu&s;t have their minds enlight|ned in the Law of God, that they may come to &s;ee their &s;ins, before they will have their hearts broken &s;o as to be acceptable with God. The eyes of Sinners mu&s;t be opened &s;o as to &s;ee &s;omething of their mi&s;erable condi|tion, before their hearts will be rightly bro|ken. Light mu&s;t break into their Souls, that they may &s;ee how things are in their Souls, before their hearts will be rightly broken. The Law mu&s;t be con&s;idered, and the Au|thor of the Law, that Sin again&s;t the Law may appear unto Sinners to be exceeding &s;in|ful, before their hearts will be duly broken for, and from &s;in. If the heart of the Sinner be duly broken, then will the Repenting Sin|ner be able truly to &s;ay, <HI>Now I &s;ee &s;omething of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Holy God, and I mu&s;t acknowledge the holine&s;s of his righteous Law; his Law is holy, ju&s;t and good, therefore Sin which breaks that Law, mu&s;t be an evil and a bitter thing.</HI></P>
<P>Examine then upon this Article as we pa&s;s along, and con&s;ider, every Soul. Is your Un|der&s;tanding &s;o enlightned as to &s;ee the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and the holine&s;s of God; to &s;ee the odiou&s;ne&s;s and the heinou&s;ne&s;s of Sin; to &s;ee the ju&s;tice and the &s;trictne&s;s of the Law of God; to &s;ee the certainty of the threatnings of the Law, to &s;ee the dreadfulne&s;s of the pu|ni&s;hment threatned by the Law upon the breakers of the Law; to &s;ee the inevitable|ne&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="039607_0033_10147DF11CE28800">
of the threatned puni&s;hment, without a full &s;atisfaction to the Law, which cannot be without a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, every way an&s;wering the Law; and that there is no &s;uch Righteou&s;ne&s;s to be had, be&s;ides the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and this cannot be had without faith in him; and this faith mu&s;t be attended with unfeigned Repentance, to which belongs brokenne&s;s of heart for, and from Sin? Do you &s;ee &s;omething about the reality of the&s;e things? If you &s;ee nothing about them, it is not likely that your hearts will be rightly broken: But if your minds are enlightned &s;o as to &s;ee, and con&s;ider and realize the&s;e and &s;uch things, there is room to hope that &s;omething is doing toward breaking of your hearts with a Go&s;pel Contrition.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>There mu&s;t be &s;ome</HI> CONVICTION <HI>upon the Con&s;cience, where there is that brokenne&s;s of heart that will be acceptable with God through Chri&s;t.</HI> This Conviction doth con&s;i&s;t in a per&s;o|nal &amp; particular application of guilt &amp; wrath unto the Sinners own Soul, &s;o as to bring the Sinner to an acknowledgment like this; <HI>If the Word of God be true, then my Soul is in a mi&s;erable Condition.</HI> For as long as notions a|bide in the head as airy, empty &s;peculations, without coming down into the heart, with a powerful impre&s;&s;ion upon the Soul, Sin|ners never have their hearts duly broken; let their notions be never &s;o good and right. The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and his Holine&s;s,
<PB N="13" REF="039607_0034_10147DB6620770E8">
the ju&s;tice and &s;trictne&s;s of his Law may be acknowledged, &s;in may be con&s;idered as an evil and hateful thing; but the Sinner will not be affected with the evilne&s;s and the hatefulne&s;s of &s;in, without &s;ome Con|viction upon the Con&s;cience, whereby a &s;en&s;e of the evil of &s;in is brought nigh unto the Soul, and the weight of &s;in is laid upon the Soul. For as the heavie&s;t weights while at a di&s;tance, will not brui&s;e nor break, but when they are laid upon us, then they may brui&s;e and break us: Thus while Sinners con&s;ider of the evil in &s;in at a di&s;tance, with|out any application of the guilt of Sin to their own Souls, in their con&s;iderations, they will not have their &s;inful heart rightly bro|ken.

heavy burden, but what they can bear up their Spirits under it, their hearts be not rightly broken. Sinners may be convinced, without being converted. This is plain. The Hearers of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> when they were told of their Wickedne&s;s in Crucifying the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>They were pricked to their hearts</HI>; their hearts began to be rightly broken.

There may be &s;ome knowledge, and acknow|ledgment of the evil that is in &s;in, as well as of the evil that comes by &s;in, without any right brokenne&s;s of heart: But where there is a right brokenne&s;s of heart, there will be affliction of Soul, becau&s;e of the burden of &s;in: Con&s;cience mu&s;t not only be convin|ced, but mu&s;t al&s;o be quickned and excited to do its duty toward the convinced Sinner; to make the Sinner con&s;ider with trembling, <HI>I have provoked the righteous and holy God, and ex|po&s;ed my &s;elf unto his terrible di&s;plea&s;ure: What &s;hall I do to e&s;cape the Wrath of God?</HI> Con&s;ci|ence reveals the Wrath of God unto the Sinner, when the heart is rightly broken, &s;o as to make the Soul of the Sinner full of di&s;|tre&s;s and angui&s;h, and to have &s;ecret wi&s;hes like the&s;e: <HI>Oh, that I had never been!

<P>Indeed, there will not be the like degrees of di&s;tre&s;s in the Souls of all Sinners, that have their hearts duly broken for Sin.</P>
<P>Some Sinners may have greater terrours, and of longer continuance than others.</P>
<P>God may work more gradually with &s;ome than with others; for the holy Spirit of God is an arbitrary Agent: He may act how he plea&s;es, and where and when he plea&s;es. <HI>The wind bloweth where it li&s;teth,</HI> and &s;o the Spirit of God may work as he plea&s;eth.

Others may lye longer under bitter di&s;tre&s;s of Soul. The terrours of God may abide upon them and &s;eem to drink up their Spirits.

They may lye but a &s;hort time under their di&s;tre&s;s of Soul by rea&s;on of the burden of their Sins. Others may have their di&s;tre&s;&s;es abiding longer upon them. They may continue a great while under the work of the Spirit, as a Spirit of bondage, be|fore they find him working as a Spirit of A|doption upon their Souls. But &s;till we mu&s;t be&s;ure that all Sinners that have their Hearts broken &s;o as to be accepted with God, feel Sin to be a grievous burthen to their Souls. They are made willing to get rid of that burden. They cann't bear to think of ly|ing under the burden of Sin. The burden of Sin is of all burdens the mo&s;t intollerable. And if they under&s;tand that they mu&s;t wait upon God in the u&s;e of the means of Grace for the influences of his holy Spirit, to draw them to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for Salvati|on; They will pray in &s;ecret and with others, and de&s;ire others to pray for them, and if they can, with them; They will, (if they can) read the Word of God, and hear his Word, and beg of God, to &s;et home his truths upon their Souls, that their Souls may be &s;till more burthened with Sin, that they may &s;till be more &s;en&s;ible of their burthen, &s;o as to be made really willing to part with Sin. They will pray that God would for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t by his holy Spirit, apply the pardoning, &s;oftning, healing Blood of Chri&s;t unto their Souls, and unite their Souls to Chri&s;t by a living Faith, and make an

Je&s;us Chri&s;t, there can be no brokenne&s;s of heart; for God out of Chri&s;t, will be a con|&s;uming fire to Sinners; their &s;inful hearts may indeed be broken by that fire, but not &s;o, as to be accepted with God, and received into his favour; but if the heart be rightly broken, there mu&s;t be that thing, in Zech. 12.10. <HI>A looking upon him that was pierced, becau&s;e of Sin.</HI> Such a look mu&s;t cau&s;e bit|terne&s;s of Soul, and brokenne&s;s of heart in Penitent Sinners. To think, we have pierced the heart of the dearly beloved Son of God, by our &s;ins, this mu&s;t break our &s;inful hearts, if they are ever duly broken. We have had &s;ome intimations that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath been the Sacrifices of God, and that his heart was broken, becau&s;e of our &s;ins. Our &s;ins have broken the heart of Chri&s;t. But we mu&s;t con&s;ider him, that our hearts may be broken: <HI>Con&s;ider him who was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and brui&s;ed for our iniquities, and upon him was the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace, and by who&s;e &s;tripes we may be healed.</HI> Con&s;ider the heart-breaking di&s;tre&s;s that our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t underwent for the &s;ake of mi&s;era|ble &s;inners; <HI>Whole the Lord laid upon Him the Iniquity of us all.</HI> Con&s;ider what he endured when his heart was broken within him, and melted like wax, and he was poured like wa|ter, and his Soul was &s;ore amazed, even unto death; and he prayed, <HI>O my Father, if it be po&s;&s;ible, let this Cup pa&s;s from me:</HI> And after that cried out, <HI>My God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> The holy heart of the Son of God was broken &s;o, that he offered prayers
<PB N="29" REF="039607_0050_10147E2B12951098">
and &s;upplications, and &s;trong crying with tears, before God. Yea, his heart was &s;o broken, that he &s;weat great drops of blood in his agony before his Crucifixion; but after this, his &s;ide was pierced with a &s;pear, &s;o that blood came from his heart. But why was all this? Wherefore was the heart of the Son of God &s;o broken? It was that Sin|ners might have their &s;inful hearts broken &s;o as to be prepared for the pardoning mercy of God. And it was that the Ju&s;tice of God might be &s;atisfied, and their Souls delivered from the guilt and filth of &s;in. The heart of Chri&s;t was broken, that his Blood might be applied to believing Sinners, for the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, and the &s;alvation of their Souls, The&s;e things mu&s;t be con&s;idered by Sinners; and they mu&s;t have, a realizing apprehen&s;ion about the readine&s;s and willingne&s;s of the Glorious God to receive broken-hearted Sin|ners into his favour for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t. <HI>If God &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him freely give us all things.</HI> If God hath broken the heart of his Son for us, will he not heal our hearts, upon our &s;eeking to him? Thus we mu&s;t con&s;ider that our hearts may be rightly bro|ken. Our eyes mu&s;t be unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for all the ble&s;&s;ings and benefits of broken hearts; if we will be accepted with God. We mu&s;t look unto Chri&s;t for all the good that is be&s;towed in, and with a broken heart. By the merit of his heart blood, mu&s;t our hearts be broken for, and from our &s;ins, and healed when &s;o broken; and the accep|tance
<PB N="30" REF="039607_0051_10147E0607B94F68">
of our brokenne&s;s of heart with God, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed unto him, who&s;e heart was fore broken: For we may not expect to be accepted with God, meerly becau&s;e our &s;in|ful herrts are broken, &s;o as to be willing to he delivered and &s;eparated from &s;in: For if we have no intere&s;t in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we cannot by any means be admitted into the favour of God, nor accepted in his right, tho' our hearts were never &s;o much broken; for we mu&s;t con&s;tantly remember that, in 1 Pet 2.5. <HI>Spiritual Sacrifice acceptable to God, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> When we try to offer broken hearts for &s;acrifices unto God, we mu&s;t look for acceptance of them thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And when ever we de&s;ire the mercy of a broken heart, or the mercies promi&s;ed with &s;uch an heart, we mu&s;t behold our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t purcha&s;ing all for us; and be|lieve that God the Father is willing, for the &s;ake of his Son, by his Holy Spirit, to be&s;tow upon us all the good things belong|ing to a broken heart, if we are but wil|ling to receive tho&s;e good things; and if we are made thus willing, we are obliged unto a broken-hearted Redeemer for that willingne&s;s. He hath purcha&s;ed and pro|cured that willingne&s;s for us, and be&s;towed it on us. Thus mu&s;t there be an appre|hen&s;ion of the pardoning mercy of God in Chri&s;t, where there is the brokenne&s;s of heart that God will accept.</P>

<HEAD>Enquiry II.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Why is &s;uch-brokenne&s;s of heart acceptable with God? And how it appears to be &s;o?</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<P><HI>An&s;w</HI> 1. Sin is pardoned and the Soul &s;ub|dued unto God when the Heart is thus broken. Therefore is this brokenne&s;s of Heart accepta|ble with God. We read in I&s;aiah 1.18. A|bout them that are willing and obedient, &s;o have their Hearts broken, <HI>Tho' their Sins be as Scarlet, they &s;hall be white as Snow; tho' they
<PB N="33" REF="039607_0054_10147E2F421946F8">
be red as Crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as Wool.</HI> The meaning is, they &s;hall be all Pardoned, and the Souls of the Sinners purifyed, as well as ju&s;tifyed. Then the clamour of their Sins, will be Silenced, and they &s;hall not hinder the cour&s;e of the Mercies of God, unto their Souls. We find in I&s;a. 59.2. It is declared to &s;ome, <HI>Your Iniquities have &s;eparated between you and your God, your Sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear.</HI> But if their Sins are pardoned, then Sinners may have acce&s;s to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t: And when the wall of &s;eparation is made by Sin, between God and our Souls is removed, then will there be a free pa&s;&s;age for mercy to our Souls. Then will God manife&s;t unto our Souls, that he doth receive us into his favour and &s;o our broken Hearts will appear not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, but accepted with the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>God is appea&s;ed unto Sinners, and well plea&s;ed with them for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, when their Hearts be &s;o broken.</HI> Their wills are brought into Gods will in brokenne&s;s of Heart, and there|fore will he not de&s;pi&s;e their broken Hearts, being reconciled unto their per&s;ons. The great conte&s;t between God and Sinners, it is this, <HI>Who &s;hall have their Will,</HI> God or Sinners? But when the Hearts of Sinners are duly broken, then they yield to God. They con|&s;ent that he &s;hould have his will. He hath attained his end upon them, and brought them to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his plea&s;ure, and &s;o he is attoned to them; Thence will God have de|light in broken Hearts, and make his abode in them, as in I&s;a. 57.5. <HI>The high and lofty
<PB N="34" REF="039607_0055_10147E0B33834950">
one that Inhabiteth Eternity, dwelleth with him that is of a contrite and humble Spirit,</HI> and he will revive &amp; comfort them that are &s;o. And he &s;ays in I&s;a. 66. <HI>To this man will I look, that is of a contrite Spirit, and that trembleth at my Word.</HI> When the Heart of <HI>Ephraim</HI> was broken &s;o as to bewail and bemoan his mi&s;erable condition, then &s;ays the Lord in Jer. 31.20. <HI>Is Ephraim my dear Son, I do earne&s;tly remember him &s;till, my bowels are troubled for him, I will &s;urely have mercy on him, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> God being reconciled unto Sinners, will &s;urely ac|cept their broken Hearts, and be well plea&s;ed with them</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>The heart of God appears in a manner broken with compa&s;&s;ion toward Mi&s;erable Sinners, when their &s;inful hearts do appear to be duly broken.</HI> But if His Heart be broken and opened with compa&s;&s;ion toward Sinners, then be &s;ure, he will not de&s;pi&s;e their brokenne&s;s of Heart. We read in Judges 10.16. The People of God had grievou&s;ly &s;inned again&s;t the Lord, Mi&s;e|ries came upon them for their Sins, they pray|ed unto the Lord for deliverance from their mi&s;eries, the Lord brought them to &s;uch a brokenne&s;s of heart that they complyed with his will, Then it follows, <HI>The Soul of the Lord was grieved for the Mi&s;ery of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>By the&s;e things we may learn a little what means that brokenne&s;s of Heart which God will not de&s;pi&s;e, and <HI>That</HI> and <HI>Why</HI> &s;uch bro|kenne&s;s of Heart will be acceptable with God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>USE 1. We might hence Learn, <HI>The
<PB N="35" REF="039607_0056_10147E326074BB28">
folly of all Sinners that harden their heart a|gain&s;t God, that will not comply with his Will.</HI> They &s;hall not, they cannot pro&s;per; for none ever yet pro&s;pered in hardening them|&s;elves again&s;t God. God evermore, overcomes all tho&s;e that harden them&s;elves again&s;t him. Remember <HI>Pharoah</HI>! If the Hearts of Sinners be not broken by the means of Grace in the time of his patience, they will certainly be dreadfully broken by the Wrath of God in the day of Vengeance. Would Sinners con&s;ent to have their Hearts broken by the means that God hath appointed for the breaking of them, they would find that the Lord would take plea&s;ure in them; He delights in broken Hearts, but as long as poor Sinners do refu&s;e to have their Hearts broken, they find their bands are made &s;tronger and &s;tronger: The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their Soul grow more and more terrible. Was it not &s;o with <HI>David,</HI> in P&s;al. 32.3. Where he &s;ays <HI>While I kept &s;ilent</HI> (from confe&s;&s;ing of Sin to God:) <HI>my bones waxed old thro' my roaring all the day.</HI> But when his Heart was broken &s;o, as to be willing to con|fe&s;s his Sin to God; Then he found relief in, relea&s;e from his trouble of Soul. There|fore &s;hould Sinners be willing to have their Hearts broken &s;o as to be prepared for the &s;en&s;e of the pardoning mercy of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. For ob&s;tinacy and obduracy in Sin will never be comfortable to Sinners. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence we may learn, what we mu&s;t do, that we may find acceptance with God thro' Chri&s;t.</HI> We mu&s;t mu&s;t get our under&s;tandings illuminated in the truths of God, our Con&s;ciences convict|ed

Make &s;ure of a change of Heart and of a real Union with Chri&s;t, and of Pardon for all Sins pa&s;t; walk hum|bly and clo&s;ely with God, rely on Chri&s;t for Help, to do &s;o. <HI>Be in the Fear of the Lord all the day long.</HI> Shun all occa&s;ions of Sin, all tendencies to Sin. Be much in Suppli|cation to the Lord.

hopeful token, that he hath begun to be|&s;tow, and will go on to be&s;tow tho&s;e good things upon us: <HI>For the Lord hath not for|&s;aken the Souls of them that are &s;eeking of him; He will fulfil the de&s;ires of them that Fear him; He hath not &s;aid to the Seed of Jacob, &s;eek ye me in vain.</HI> If God encline our Hearts to ask for good things, there is room for us to hope that he hath prepared his Ear to hear us. If &s;incere Prayers break out of our Hearts for more brokenne&s;s of Heart, then do our Hearts begin to be rightly broken. Then may we con&s;ider for our everla&s;ting encouragement, tho&s;e good and &s;weet words in P&s;al. 34.18. <HI>The Lord is nigh to them, that are of a broken Heart, and &s;aveth the Contrite of Spirit.</HI></P>
