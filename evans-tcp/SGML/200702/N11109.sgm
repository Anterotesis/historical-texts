<P>_WHEREAS by an act 6th Geo. III. it is declared, that Parliament has full power and authority to make laws and &s;tatutes to bind the people of the colonies, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. And whereas reiterated complaints, and mo&s;t dangerous di&s;orders have grown, touch|ing the right of taxation claimed and exerci&s;ed over America, to the di&s;tur|bance of peace and good order there,
