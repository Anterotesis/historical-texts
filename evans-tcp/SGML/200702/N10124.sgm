<P>_WHEN opportunities for <HI>doing of good,</HI> or at lea&s;t our <HI>attempting to do &s;ome good, are providentially pre&s;ented and offered</HI> to our acceptance; it &s;eems to be fit and right that we &s;hould take and <HI>improve them</HI> in a proper manner.</P>
<P>And &s;ince <HI>&s;uch an opportunity</HI> is now afforded, for di&s;cour&s;ing, in the audience of a <HI>poor crimi|nal</HI> under a &s;entence of death, which is this day to be executed on him, and to &s;uch a large a&s;&s;emb|ly collected on this occa&s;ion; it is judged to be &s;uitable and right to <HI>accept</HI> of it; however affect|ing, irk&s;om and painful it may be to the per&s;on who is now called to it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012862_0004_0F8B6E20C7F3B4A0">With diffidence to my&s;elf therefore, and with a due concern of mind about a right and pro|fitable di&s;charge of the duty, which at pre&s;ent falls to my lot, it mu&s;t be advi&s;able to implore, and rely on, the aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that divine Lord, that <HI>&s;trong Redeemer, who gives power to the feeble and to the weak encrea&s;es &s;trength,</HI> that he would graciou&s;ly uphold in this &s;ervice and carry well through it; and at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be de&s;ired, that all, who are <HI>piou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed</HI> in this a&s;&s;embly, would <HI>agree and unite in their good wi&s;hes and prayers,</HI> that <HI>divine &s;uccours</HI> may be given in our di&s;cour&s;ing and <HI>a divine influ|ence</HI> and ble&s;&s;ing may accompany and follow it.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age, cho&s;en for the &s;ubject of our fol|lowing di&s;cour&s;e, and apprehended to be as ap|po&s;ite as any other to &s;uch an occa&s;ion as the pre&s;ent, was uttered <HI>by him, into who&s;e lips grace was poured, and who &s;pake as never man &s;pake</HI>: He is now to be con&s;idered as being in the place, where he had <HI>his education</HI>: For it is written in the context, v. 16. <HI>And he came to</HI> Nazareth, <HI>where he was brought up</HI>: for, though he was born at <HI>Bethlehem</HI>; he had his education at <HI>Na|zareth.</HI> And <HI>as his cu&s;tom was, he went</HI> there <HI>into the &s;ynagogue on the &s;abbath day.</HI> So then altho' our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour was <HI>Lord of the &s;ab|bath</HI>; it was however <HI>his cu&s;tom to keep it.</HI> And why then &s;hould any of us think it unfit and improper to &s;pend <HI>one day in a week</HI> in holy re&s;t and religious wor&s;hip according to <HI>his example,</HI> and <HI>to his honour</HI> as our maker and redeemer? Our Lord then, <HI>according to his cu&s;tom on the
<PB N="7" REF="012862_0005_0F8B6E24620EDB58">
&s;abbath day went into the &s;ynagogue</HI>; i. e. the hou&s;e &s;et apart for <HI>public prayers,</HI> and for reading, expounding and hearing the word of God: And, being at meeting at the proper time for it, he <HI>&s;tood up to read.</HI> Such honour did the &s;on of God put on <HI>the holy &s;criptures</HI>: He cho&s;e to take the book, and read his text out of it, rather than to deliver one of his own: And ju&s;t as he is about to read his text out of it, he ri&s;es up in a re&s;pect|ful manner towards it: And &s;uch <HI>like re&s;pect does the word of God ju&s;tly de&s;erve from tho&s;e, who preach, and tho&s;e who hear it.</HI></P>
<P>Now, when our Lord &s;tood up to read, it follows, in the beginning of the 17. v. <HI>there was delivered to him the book of the prophet</HI> E&s;aias. In order to your under&s;tanding of which, we would ob&s;erve to you, <HI>that a jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue</HI> had <HI>ten per&s;ons,</HI> who had the management of its af|fairs; among whom one of them was called the <HI>Chazan, and the angel, of the &s;ynagogue, or a&s;&s;em|bly</HI>; and he was properly <HI>the over&s;eer</HI> of it; to whom it belonged on the &s;abbath day to call forth <HI>&s;even per&s;ons; five</HI> of which were u&s;ually common <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> &s;uch as he thought fit, to read &s;ome portion out of the &s;acred volume. And it is very probable, that even in this way, by <HI>the angel of the</HI> &s;ynagogue, our Saviour was furni&s;hed with a proper occa&s;ion of declaring the truth. Well! The book of the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> was by the over&s;eer of the &s;ynagogue de|livered to our Saviour. <HI>And he opened the book</HI>; or as the <HI>greek</HI> more properly &s;ignifies, <HI>unfold|ed
<PB N="8" REF="012862_0006_0F8B6E286DAEE2A0">
the roll</HI>; as, when <HI>he had done reading, he clo&s;ed the book,</HI> i. e. <HI>he rolled up the roll</HI>: From which it evidently appears, that the books of tho&s;e days were in the form of <HI>rolls.</HI> But now our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, having <HI>unfurled the roll</HI>; behold, as divine providence ordered it, the LXI<HI>&s;t.</HI> chapter of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s prophecies &s;trikes his eye, wherein is a celebrated prophecy con|cerning him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Some indeed have in&s;i&s;ted on it, that the pro|phecy quoted in v. 18 and 19th, under our view, was literally and punctually fulfilled with re&s;pect to the prophet I&s;aiah him&s;elf: And it mu&s;t indeed be acknowledged, that every &s;entence of it might be accommodated to him.</P>
<P>But, behold, a greater than I&s;aiah is here: We have here the infallible te&s;timony of our Saviour him&s;elf, that this whole pa&s;&s;age refers to him and was fulfilled in him.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not now particularly illu&s;trate all the parts of this prophecy, as belonging to our Saviour and accompli&s;hed by him: But we &s;hall confine our&s;elves to the <HI>particular clau&s;e,</HI> which has been read in your hearing; from which it appears, that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was not only &s;ent to <HI>preach healing, but</HI> to <HI>communicate it to broken hearts</HI>: For, &s;ays he in the prophecy of him, he hath <HI>&s;ent me to heal the broken hearted.</HI></P>
<P>Here therefore we have two important and mo&s;t intere&s;ting things pre&s;ented to our &s;erious con&s;ideration and earne&s;t heeding at this time.</P>
<P N="1">I. The character of our divine Redeemer&punc;
<PB N="9" REF="012862_0007_0F8B6E29FB7EF8E8">
which is <HI>that of a phy&s;ician, or healer of &s;ouls</HI>;</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The de&s;cription of tho&s;e,</HI> to whom he will approve and manife&s;t him&s;elf to be <HI>a divine heal|er</HI>: And <HI>the&s;e</HI> are <HI>the broken in heart.</HI></P>
<P>Let us begin then with con&s;idering <HI>the ami|able and excellent character of our</HI> divine Re|deemer: And this is <HI>that of a phy&s;ician, or heal|er of &s;ouls.</HI></P>
<P>It is declared in the prophecy concerning him, and al&s;o from him, <HI>he hath &s;ent me to heal</HI>; and, in the following context, v. 21, we find, that <HI>he began to &s;ay to them, this day is this &s;cripture ful|filled in your ears.</HI> So then he was at that time <HI>accompli&s;hing the bu&s;ine&s;s for which he was &s;ent</HI> of his father: He was performing the part of a <HI>&s;piritual phy&s;ician,</HI> and <HI>a healer of tho&s;e, who were broken in heart.</HI></P>
<P>But not only in the prophecy, quoted in our text, but al&s;o in other prophecies of the old te&s;|tament: he is characterized as <HI>a glorious healer.</HI> And indeed he is mo&s;t ju&s;tly characterized in this manner. He therefore &s;peaks of him&s;elf as <HI>a phy&s;ician</HI> in Matth. 9.12. Where <HI>&s;inners,</HI> &s;en&s;ible of their &s;piritual indi&s;po&s;ition, are de|&s;cribed as <HI>the &s;ick</HI>; and CHRIST is intended and meant as <HI>the phy&s;ician of tho&s;e, that are &s;ick</HI> in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>And now, for the clearing and confirming it, that <HI>he is in truth and reality the healer of &s;ouls</HI>; we would propo&s;e the following things to your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012862_0008_0F8B6E2A9AD9CF50">Fir&s;t of all; <HI>He is &s;uch a healer with regard to his</HI> divine nature: for it is he, that is to be under&s;tood as &s;aying, in Exod. 15.26. I Jeho|vah, that healeth thee; in the Hebrew it is <HI>Repheka,</HI> i. e. thy phy&s;ician. And indeed he not only heals the di&s;ea&s;es of <HI>natural Egypt,</HI> if they come upon his people; but he <HI>heals the &s;ouls,</HI> which are afflicted with the di&s;tempers of <HI>&s;piritual Egypt, &s;uch as blindne&s;s of mind and hardne&s;s of heart</HI> and the like maladies: For in truth when the <HI>hearts of any are &s;ick and wounded, can any but he,</HI> who is the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t phy&s;ician, <HI>heal them</HI>? it is therefore &s;ung to his perpetual prai&s;e and glory, as in P&s;alm 147.3. <HI>He,</HI> i. e. Jehovah, <HI>healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds</HI>; in which words our divine Lord is compared to a <HI>&s;kilful &s;urgeon,</HI> as well as a phy&s;ician; for he is herein repre&s;ented not only as <HI>binding up the wounds</HI> of human &s;ouls, but as applying <HI>healing medicines to them.</HI> Thus the &s;on of the highe&s;t as having <HI>the divine e&s;&s;ence or nature</HI> in him, is <HI>the healer of &s;ouls</HI>: Nor indeed, had he not <HI>the divine nature</HI> in him, could he have <HI>healed one, that was broken in heart.</HI> As therefore it was very fitly enquired in Mark 11.7. <HI>Who can for|give &s;ins but God only?</HI> &s;o we may with the like fitne&s;s and propriety &s;ay, <HI>who can heal hu|man &s;ouls but God only?</HI> now it is our Saviour God, who, by his divine influence and help, <HI>is the phy&s;ician and healer of the children of men.</HI></P>
<P>But then; not only <HI>as God,</HI> but <HI>as the Me|diator
<PB N="11" REF="012862_0009_0F8B6E2B42A67780">
al&s;o, is he the healer of human &s;ouls.</HI> As he is thus by office a <HI>&s;piritual healer,</HI> &s;o he has been divinely <HI>qualified and &s;et apart</HI> for this office and bu&s;ine&s;s. As, under the old te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation, they, who were <HI>&s;eparated</HI> unto &s;ome &s;pecial work and bu&s;ine&s;s by the divine appoint|ment, were <HI>anointed</HI> for it; &s;o their <HI>prie&s;ts and their kings were anointed</HI> to their re&s;pective of|fices: Thus al&s;o our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is <HI>above all others the anointed of the Lord</HI>: hence the name of <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tos</HI> in Greek is given to him; each of which words properly &s;ignifieth <HI>anointed.</HI> Not that Chri&s;t was anointed with any <HI>material oil</HI>; as the prie&s;ts and kings were under the old te&s;tament di&s;pen|&s;ation: but he was anointed with <HI>a &s;piritual oil:</HI> For it was <HI>the &s;pirit of the Lord, who a|nointed him</HI>; with re&s;pect <HI>to his humanity</HI>: and, in con&s;equence hereof, it appears, that he was divinely <HI>repleni&s;hed with gifts and graces</HI>: and hence he is &s;aid, in our text and context; <HI>to be &s;ent of GOD.</HI> Which implies and intimates, as that <HI>he was qualified for the bu&s;ine&s;s</HI>; &s;o that he was <HI>called and &s;ent forth to the office and work</HI> of a phy&s;ician and healer of &s;ouls. And indeed <HI>the father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> would not tru&s;t the &s;ouls of the human race in any other hands but his: For he certainly knew, when he <HI>put them all into the hands of his &s;on,</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, that <HI>he had put them into mo&s;t able, &s;kilful and faithful hands</HI>; and that none of them, who would come to him for help
<PB N="12" REF="012862_0010_0F8B6E2C38CDCF20">
and healing, &s;hould mi&s;carry; or <HI>be plucked out of his</HI> healing <HI>hands.</HI> It is on the account of his be|ing entru&s;ted with this office of a Mediator, that he is &s;aid to be the <HI>great &s;hepherd and bi&s;hop, as well as a phy&s;ician of &s;ouls</HI>: And hence he is &s;aid to be <HI>the Saviour of the world.</HI> Not that he is a <HI>mere temporal Saviour,</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> vainly imagined that he would be; and as they even to this day vain|ly expect him to be. But he <HI>is a &s;piritual heal|er and Saviour</HI>; a Saviour of immortal &s;ouls: When they are <HI>infected and wounded by &s;in,</HI> he <HI>healeth</HI> them, <HI>and &s;aveth them from death.</HI> It is as <HI>the mediator,</HI> and <HI>the only mediator</HI> for the &s;ouls of men, that he affords relief again&s;t every &s;piritual malady. As their &s;ouls are <HI>darkned and full of ignorance</HI> with regard to things &s;piritual and divine; the &s;on of God, as a <HI>prophet,</HI> re|lieves and helps that malady. As they are <HI>guil|ty,</HI> alienated from GOD and obnoxious to his di&s;plea&s;ure; <HI>Chri&s;t, as a prie&s;t,</HI> delivers them from that wretchedne&s;s. And the &s;ouls, which are <HI>under the power of &s;in and other &s;piritual enemies, Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord</HI> re&s;cues; and he <HI>&s;ubdues all tho&s;e enemies,</HI> which would otherwi&s;e have <HI>proved their ruin.</HI> It is ob&s;ervable, that, in our text and context, there is a reference had to the <HI>threefold office of our divine Redeem|er.</HI> It &s;eems here to refer to his <HI>prophetic office,</HI> that he is &s;aid <HI>to preach the go&s;pel to the poor.</HI> It &s;eems to refer to his <HI>prie&s;tly office</HI>&punc; that he is de&s;cribed as <HI>affording relief</HI> to the &s;inners, who are broken in heart: And, when he is &s;aid to

afford <HI>deliverance to the captives, and the reco|very of &s;ight to the blind,</HI> that, is to &s;inners, <HI>who&s;e eyes are put out</HI>; it intends and &s;ignifies, that God by his <HI>mighty power</HI> delivers them from this wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery, and that by vir|tue of <HI>his royal office.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, have we con&s;idered and &s;hewed, <HI>how our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a nature tru|ly divine, and in the exerci&s;e of his mediatory of|fice, is the phy&s;ician of human &s;ouls</HI>: And we &s;hall further &s;ee, that <HI>he is the healer of the &s;ouls of men; if we con&s;ider, what is the healing which he affords unto them.</HI> And now there are various things implied in <HI>this:</HI></P>
<P>For, fir&s;t of all; <HI>Forgivene&s;s of &s;in</HI> is implied in this healing. As long <HI>as the guilt of &s;in,</HI> yea of any one &s;in, lies on the &s;ouls of men, <HI>they are in a morbid and hazardous &s;tate</HI>: But, when this &s;in is <HI>pardoned,</HI> they are <HI>recovered</HI> out of this &s;tate. Now <HI>this</HI> is obtained by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Had it not been for <HI>this glori|ous Lord our healer,</HI> we &s;hould never have had <HI>this remi&s;&s;ion</HI> of our &s;ins: But, through him, every one, that <HI>penitently believes</HI> on him, has the <HI>free and full forgivene&s;s of all his &s;ins.</HI> It <HI>is with</HI> regard to this, that <HI>the blood of the re|deemer will heal the &s;ouls of men.</HI> Nor can any other balm or medicine be &s;o effectual as this: For, <HI>by his &s;tripes</HI> and wounds and blood <HI>we are healed.</HI> And O! what a <HI>healing,</HI> what a ble&s;&s;ed <HI>medicine</HI> indeed is it, which <HI>will produce and work a perfect cure of &s;ouls wounded by</HI> guil|tine&s;s? And then,</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012862_0012_0F8B6E2D89A81778"><HI>Another</HI> thing implied in this <HI>healing</HI> is the <HI>renewing and &s;anctifying of men's &s;ouls.</HI> As the <HI>&s;ouls of men are wounded and made &s;ick by the guilt of &s;in</HI> lying upon them; &s;o they are <HI>by the filth and impurity of &s;in: That</HI> therefore, which is contrary to this and removes it, re&s;|tores the &s;oul and makes it well. Now this is renewing and &s;anctifying grace, which cau&s;es the &s;oul to recover from its impurity. The beginning of this healing is, when any &s;ouls, by the converting grace of God, are made new creatures: For it is this grace, which healeth human &s;ouls: And, the more of this grace any have within them, the greater and more com|pleat is the cure produced in their &s;ouls. And now this healing is from Chri&s;t: As he is full of grace, as well as truth; he is made al&s;o of God unto other's &s;anctification: And he thus healeth them. His word indeed, his go&s;pel, is the in&s;trument of the divine healing, which he affords to human &s;ouls; and <HI>this</HI> has a virtue divinely healing in it: But the grand efficient of renewing and &s;anctifying is the &s;pirit of our living and powerful Redeemer. As he is the &s;pirit of grace, all healing virtue proceeds from him: He quickneth and re&s;tores the feeble and langui&s;hing &s;ouls. And &s;ome of the&s;e, that have been &s;ick, and even nigh unto death, have by the &s;pirit of our glorious Lord been brought to life and health again: For, as the&s;e &s;ouls within us quicken and actuate our bodies, &s;o the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t quickens and actuates hu|man &s;ouls; and by this, they are recovered and healed.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="012862_0013_0F8B6E2E45468A48">And further; the con&s;olation of human &s;ouls is implied in this healing of them. The &s;ouls, which are &s;ad, very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and quite di&s;con|&s;olate are &s;aid to be &s;ick, to be wounded, to be brought low. Surely then, they mu&s;t be reliev|ed and healed by the affording of con&s;olation to them: And hence indeed we read, of the re&s;tor|ing of comforts, as in I&s;aiah 57.18. And now this is a &s;pecial thing intended in the text: For to heal the broken hearted is to re&s;tore comfort to them. And now our divine healer Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the great author of this comfort. And, when any have been in trouble of &s;pirit, and afterwards received good comfort, this relief and comfort has been from the Redeemer, who has poured his wine and oil into their wounded &s;ouls. But it is by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, that this effect al&s;o is wrought: For this &s;pirit is not only a &s;anctifier, but a comforter al&s;o: And it is by his &s;prinkling the virtue of the Redeemer's blood, that he cau&s;|es the &s;ouls of his people to be comforted and ea&s;y. And be&s;ides, it is by the word of pro|mi&s;e, that he communicates comfort, which is healing to their &s;ouls. Suppo&s;ing their &s;ouls be ever &s;o di&s;con&s;olate; yet a divine promi&s;e admini&s;tred will as a cordial revive it: And the &s;ouls which were before drooping and di&s;con|&s;olate, will be pre&s;ently thus re&s;tored. But now it is the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, who makes the word of the go&s;pel to become effectual, who applies the precious promi&s;es thereof to their con&s;olation and healing.</P>

<P>There are then &s;ome, who are broken in heart: And the&s;e are the people, to whom which our Lord di&s;covers and manife&s;ts him&s;elf as a healer.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place then; we &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew you, who they be, that an&s;wer to the de&s;cription of the broken hearted: And here|upon we &s;hall attempt to &s;hew you the Redeemer as healing them.</P>
<P>The broken hearted then are to be fir&s;t known by us: And who are they, to whom this de&s;cription belongs? Now the&s;e are &s;uch as follow:</P>

when any <HI>are deprived of their e&s;tate, and of their liberty,</HI> and for many years they are <HI>deprived of opportunities for the wor&s;hip of the mo&s;t high with his people</HI>; as was the ca&s;e of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in <HI>Ba|bylon</HI>; it mu&s;t than be a time of grievous affliction to them, and breaking to their hearts.

<P>Again; <HI>A deep &s;en&s;e of &s;in,</HI> and hence of <HI>the di|vine di&s;plea&s;ure and wrath due for it, cau&s;es to be broken hearted.</HI> This will cau&s;e the mo&s;t &s;tubborn &s;inner with the mo&s;t <HI>obdurate</HI> heart, to give way. <HI>His heart</HI> will &s;tart and <HI>break</HI> before it. And indeed what heart is there &s;o &s;trong and &s;o &s;tout, but mu&s;t &s;ink and <HI>break</HI> under &s;uch an in&s;upportable burden? <HI>A wounded &s;pirit who can bear?</HI> Now <HI>a &s;pirit op|pre&s;&s;ed</HI> with the <HI>&s;en&s;e of its own guiltine&s;s</HI> before God and awakened with the &s;en&s;e of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure and indignation, and the effects of the &s;ame due for &s;in, is &s;uch a wounded &s;pirit.

<P>And further; The hearts of men are broken mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly with the perception and &s;en&s;e of di|vine mercy: And verily that heart mu&s;t be hard as a rock, and &s;tronger than an adamant, <HI>which love and mercy divine will not break.</HI> Even the ba&s;e and obdurate <HI>heart</HI> of a <HI>Saul</HI> began to break at the

clear view and perception of the mercy and kind|ne&s;s of his injured &s;on in law <HI>David.</HI> But how much more <HI>may the hearts</HI> of well-di&s;po&s;ed people break under a proper &s;en&s;e of the mercy of God in Chri&s;t our Lord? It was this &s;en&s;e of the divine mercy through the Mediator in forgiving her many and great &s;ins, which <HI>broke the heart</HI> of the penitent <HI>Mary</HI>; and, from her <HI>broken heart,</HI> proceeded her penitential tears and the other expre&s;&s;ions and evi|dences of her love and gratitude to her gracious Lord. We readily grant that a &s;en&s;e of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure may di&s;turb and &s;hock, and in &s;ome degree break <HI>the heart</HI>; but yet it will not <HI>effectu|ally break it,</HI> &s;o as to prepare it for <HI>healing</HI>: No! It mu&s;t be a &s;en&s;e of divine <HI>mercy</HI> in Chri&s;t ac|companying and following it, which will produce this &s;alutary <HI>effect.</HI></P>
<P>But having thus &s;hewed you <HI>the broken-hearted</HI>; we are now, in the next place, to con&s;ider the Re|deemer <HI>as healing them</HI>: Which indeed is the very de&s;ign and end for which he was &s;ent of his Father: For &s;ays he, in the prophecy, and by our text al&s;o, <HI>he hath &s;ent me to heal the broken hearted.</HI> When the hearts of the &s;inful children of men then are properly and thoroughly <HI>broken,</HI> then the great and good Phy&s;ician of &s;ouls will heal them. Indeed the breaking of their hearts it&s;elf may be &s;aid to be owing to him. And as he is able to break a &s;tony heart, and he accordingly does it; &s;o he can <HI>cure</HI> the &s;tony heart, when it is broken: The &s;ame di|vine and powerful hand, which is able to wound and <HI>break the heart,</HI> can bind it up and heal it.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>broken hearted</HI> &s;inners them&s;elves, they perceive their need of Chri&s;t, as the Phy&s;ician of

their &s;ouls: And, while they who account them&s;elves righteous, and who are not &s;en&s;ible of their <HI>wounds</HI> and <HI>indi&s;po&s;itions,</HI> will not &s;eek to the divine Phy&s;i|cian, the&s;e will &s;eek and <HI>cry earne&s;tly</HI> to him for help and healing: For, while <HI>the whole,</HI> or tho&s;e who fancy them&s;elves &s;o, <HI>have no need of a divine phy&s;ician,</HI> or imagine that they have not any need of one; the &s;ick, the &s;piritually indi&s;po&s;ed and woun|ded, and who know them&s;elves to be &s;o, will apply to the heavenly Healer. So the <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> of old, who was &s;en&s;ible of his being bitten by a <HI>fiery &s;erpent,</HI> and of the pain and angui&s;h ari&s;ing from it, knew how to <HI>prize the brazen &s;erpent,</HI> and <HI>looked anxious and agonizing towards it,</HI> and &s;o <HI>obtained healing</HI>: For, Sirs, <HI>the Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken heart,</HI> i. e. he is nigh to help and heal them; <HI>and &s;aveth &s;uch as be of a contrite &s;pirit,</HI> as in <HI>P&s;a.</HI> 34.18: And as being <HI>near to help,</HI> and powerful and gracious to &s;ave; doubtle&s;s <HI>he will help and &s;ave all</HI> that <HI>weary and labouring come to him and rely on his ability and gracious readine&s;s</HI> to help and &s;ave them. And indeed he has <HI>promi&s;ed that he will do &s;o.</HI> So then <HI>this promi&s;e</HI> belongs to all <HI>broken-hearted &s;inners.</HI> There is a <HI>promi&s;e of grace</HI> to &s;uch to help them in their times of need. And there is <HI>a promi&s;e of a free and full pardon</HI> made to &s;uch &s;inners, and of right therefore belonging to them.

<P>But, having offered the&s;e things for clearing, <HI>illu&s;trating, and confirming the heads of di&s;cour&s;e</HI> propo&s;ed to our con&s;ideration from the text, we may now <HI>reflect</HI> in &s;ome &s;uitable manner from the whole. Here then,</P>
<P>In the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> place, <HI>we &s;ee what is the &s;ickne&s;s and indi&s;po&s;ition of human &s;ouls: It is the &s;in</HI> which is within them: And <HI>this</HI> cau&s;es the &s;ouls of men to &s;tand in need of <HI>healing.</HI> And had it not been for <HI>this,</HI> the human race would have <HI>had no need of a divine Phy&s;ician. Sin,</HI> therefore, is to be con&s;idered as <HI>a di&s;ea&s;e</HI>: And <HI>this does to human &s;ouls, as &s;ickne&s;s</HI> does to human bodies: It <HI>enervates them,</HI> and <HI>cau&s;es a Pro&s;tration of &s;trength</HI> within them: And, <HI>by this</HI> they are rendered <HI>&s;o infirm and feeble</HI> that they <HI>cannot walk, nor</HI> &s;carcely <HI>take a &s;tep</HI> in the way of du|ty and happine&s;s. And as <HI>&s;ickne&s;s</HI> u&s;es gradu|ally to end in death; &s;o it is as to <HI>the di&s;ea&s;e of the heart and &s;oul</HI>: It is <HI>in its own nature</HI> and tendency <HI>deadly</HI>: And it will prove fatal, if there be not a <HI>timely application and improve|ment of proper remedies</HI>: If there be not <HI>this, the end</HI> of the &s;piritual indi&s;po&s;ition <HI>will be death.</HI> But whoever <HI>converteth a &s;inner from the error of his way will &s;ave his &s;oul from death, and will hide a multitude of &s;ins,</HI> as it is written

in <HI>Jam.</HI> v. 20. But,</P>
<P>In the <HI>Second</HI> Place, What will then become of the&s;e &s;inners, who are <HI>not broken hearted, but are of hard and impenitent hearts?</HI> As they want <HI>healing,</HI> &s;o <HI>they will die without it:</HI> For <HI>die they mu&s;t, if they be not divinely healed.</HI> We do not read CHRIST <HI>was &s;ent to heal</HI> tho&s;e laboring of that <HI>hardne&s;s of heart,</HI> which is contrary to <HI>brokenne&s;s of heart</HI>: Wherefore CHRIST <HI>will not heal &s;uch.</HI> And how indeed &s;hould he heal the wounds of their &s;ouls, who are not pro|perly &s;en&s;ible that they have any? And ala&s;s! how many of the&s;e are there, and that even in places <HI>of evangelical light and liberty!</HI> Though <HI>the word of</HI> GOD <HI>is like a hammer,</HI> a ponderous hammer, which breaks the rock in pieces; yet it cannot break their hearts: Though they have heard di&s;cour&s;es of judgments divine, and of &s;alvation and mercy by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; They continue unhumbled, unbroken to this very day. Nor yet will the divine di&s;pen&s;ations, whether merciful or afflictive, <HI>break their hearts</HI>: No! like <HI>Pharoah,</HI> they harden their hearts under all the divine dealings. And how many are there, who do not properly mourn and grieve for their &s;ins of heart and life? But they continue with con|tentment and plea&s;ure in their evil habits and ways; and they even make a &s;port and <HI>mock</HI> at <HI>&s;in,</HI> and take delight in the iniquities of others as well as their own. Now is Chri&s;t <HI>&s;ent to heal</HI> &s;uch as the&s;e, who wilfully remain impenitent; or does he any where &s;ay, that he will recover them, who go on with hardne&s;s of heart in their

<P>In the third place; Let us all &s;eriou&s;ly inquire and examine within our&s;elves, whether we are yet &s;uch <HI>broken hearted</HI> ones as our divine Phy&s;i|cian will heal? We readily imagine, that one and all of us are willing to be <HI>healed</HI> by Chri&s;t; that is to &s;ay, we are willing to have our <HI>&s;ins for|given</HI> and our &s;ouls <HI>eternally &s;aved</HI>: But the que&s;|tion is, whether, by <HI>brokenne&s;s of heart,</HI> we are pre|pared for the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings and entitled to them? Say then is moral <HI>evil,</HI> or <HI>&s;in</HI> become di&s;ta&s;teful and grievous to us; and is it our greate&s;t burden? Do we cry out under the pre&s;&s;ure of it, <HI>O wretch|ed that I am! who will deliver me from it?</HI> And have we a becoming bitterne&s;s and agony of &s;oul within us for all our iniquities and abominations? If we have &s;o, we may then comfortably hope and expect, that he will <HI>heal us,</HI> and give re&s;t and comfort to our &s;ouls. And &s;ay further; are our <HI>wills broken and &s;ubdued</HI> to the divine will? Are we happily brought to yield to our gracious God and Saviour, to &s;ubject our&s;elves entirely to him and &s;ay without any re&s;erve at all to him, <HI>O my Lord and my God, what woulde&s;t thou have me to do,</HI> or <HI>to undergo for thee?</HI> And ca&s;ting our&s;elves down at his feet, and lying pro&s;trate there, can we acquie&s;ce in his di&s;po&s;al, and yet expre&s;s our expectations of mercy and grace from him, &s;ay|ing, <HI>Here I am, O Lord, before thee; be unto me even as thou wilt: Let the Lord of all do with

with me as &s;eemeth good in his &s;ight:</HI> But yet, <HI>O glorious Lord, my hope is in thee; and all my expec|tation is alone from thee, who art mighty to &s;ave, and gracious to help, in the time of need</HI> and anxiety. Moreover, let it be enquired, are our hearts not only <HI>broken</HI> for &s;in, but al&s;o <HI>broken</HI> off from it? Have we, with <HI>broken hearts and contrite &s;pirits,</HI> both confe&s;&s;ed and for&s;aken all our &s;ins, of heart and life, of fle&s;h and &s;pirit? And have we en|deavoured in all fit ways, and to the utmo&s;t of our power, to make re&s;titution for the damages and wrongs which we have done to others by our faults and iniquities? For, my hearers this day of all degrees, of all ages, and of all conditions, we mu&s;t recommend it to your con&s;ideration and your remembrance for good, that &s;o much <HI>bro|kenne&s;s</HI> and <HI>contrition</HI> of heart and &s;oul as this is nece&s;&s;ary for us all in order to prepare us for <HI>divine healing</HI>: Nor may we otherwi&s;e ex|pect pardon and happine&s;s through the Mediator: For without a thorough cover&s;ion, we cannot obtain and enjoy the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>But here, as it mu&s;t be expected, it may there|fore be allowed, to u&s;e a more particular and pointed addre&s;s to the poor young Pri&s;oner, here before the Lord, who is appointed to death for aggravated crimes, and mu&s;t this day &s;uffer it from the hands of the civil Magi&s;trate, who is a revenger for anger again&s;t &s;uch as practi&s;e evil.</P>
<P>It is enough to affect us all in common with grief, and how much more &s;orrowful then mu&s;t it be to his afflicted relatives and friends, whom we heartily pity, and with whom we weep, that

<P>And now you &s;ee the truth of the &s;acred pro|verb is found to be awfully verified concerning you, <HI>He that being often reproved, hardneth his neck, &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy,</HI> as in Prov. 29.1, For behold as you have not only been <HI>&s;tiffening your neck,</HI> but <HI>hardening your heart</HI> in your evil ways, you now find the per|nicious con&s;equence of it: For having been wicked overmuch, you are now doom'd to die before your time.</P>
<P>But the great concern, which you are now to have upon your anxious mind, is, how after a &s;hort life too much &s;pent in idlene&s;s, folly, vice and wickedn&s;s, you may die &s;afely and happily; and it is, we hope, your &s;ollicitous enquiry, <HI>Sirs, what &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>You have now been hearing of that &s;en&s;ibili|ty of &s;in and brokenne&s;s of heart for it, which is proper and nece&s;&s;ary, in order to prepare for <HI>di|vine healing</HI> and perfect and eternal happine&s;s.

And, as he is a perfectly good and gracious Phy&s;ician, he is therefore as will|ing, as he is able, to heal and re&s;tore all bro|ken, di&s;ea&s;ed, and infirm &s;ouls, that are &s;en&s;ible of their want of him.</P>
<P>Other Phy&s;icians, and even they who have the cure of &s;ouls, with regard to di&s;tempered minds and hearts, are comparatively of no value and quite in&s;ignificant: For, however well in|clined, knowing, and able they may be, they cannot heal di&s;ea&s;ed &s;ouls, and cure their &s;piri|tual wounds. It is therefore in vain to depend on them for re&s;tored &s;ouls and &s;piritual health.</P>
<P>Wherefore, cea&s;ing from men, even while improving them, as it is our duty to be, we are to repair and addre&s;s our&s;elves to him, who <HI>has the words of eternal life,</HI> the words of perfect healing and everla&s;ting happine&s;s: For <HI>to whom el&s;e &s;hould we go but unto him?</HI></P>
<P>Let us all then, with broken hearts, look and cry to him, and rely on him for his heal|ing

and &s;aving mercies; and that with a cor|dial inclination and firm purpo&s;e to follow all his directions and coun&s;els, in order to our ob|taining forgivene&s;s and &s;alvation from him: And, if &s;ome of the&s;e coun&s;els appear hard, <HI>as to pluck out a right eye and cut off a right hand and ca&s;t them away</HI> from us, and to <HI>re&s;tore what we have wrongfully taken away</HI> from others, as far as it is in our power to do it; yet we ought to comply with them, in order to our obtaining pardon and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s here, but very proper and &s;ea&s;onable, to put a momentous que&s;tion to any incon&s;iderate, vain, and impenitent per&s;on that may be in this a&s;&s;embly: If then you own your&s;elf a human creature and a rea&s;onable be|ing, let me demand of you, and let your con|&s;cious heart, in the fear of God, give an&s;wer: Is it not better to part with every &s;in, and even that which is mo&s;t dear and plea&s;ing to you, for Chri&s;t and to gain healing and happine&s;s by him? Is it not va&s;tly, yea infinitely, better for you to be renewed and pardoned, and &s;o to have your &s;oul &s;aved from &s;in and wrath, and to be perfect|ly and forever ble&s;&s;ed, then to continue in vice and retain your lu&s;ts, and to peri&s;h forever?</P>

<HEAD>The LIFE, LAST WORDS, and DYING SPEECH of LEVI AMES, Who was executed at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> on Thur&s;day Afternoon, <DATE>the Twenty-fir&s;t day of <HI>October,</HI> 1773,</DATE> for Burglary. Taken from his own mouth, and publi&s;hed at his de&s;ire, as a &s;olemn warning to all, more particularly young people. <HI>There is a way that &s;eemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</HI> Prov. 14.12.</HEAD>
<P>I LEVI AMES, aged twenty-one years, was born in <HI>Groton,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> of a credible family: My father's name was <HI>Ja|cob Ames,</HI> who died when I was but two years old. I am the fir&s;t of the family who was ever di&s;graced. My prevailing &s;in, and that for which I am &s;oon to &s;uffer death, was <HI>Thieving</HI>; to practice which I began early, and pur&s;ued it con&s;tantly, except at certain intervals, when my con&s;cience made me unea&s;y, and I re|&s;olved to do &s;o no more.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t thefts were &s;mall. I began this awful practice by &s;teal|ing a couple of eggs, then a jack-knife, after that &s;ome chalk. But being detected and reproved for the crime, I thought to repent and reform; but found my&s;elf powerfully urged to repeat this wickedne&s;s, by the temptations of the devil, with which I again complied. My tender mother &s;eeing me take to &s;uch horrid cour&s;es, and dreading the con&s;equences, often entreated and pleaded with me to turn from my evil ways, and I as often a&s;&s;ured her that I would. Had I followed her good advice and council, I &s;hould never have come to this &s;hameful and untimely end. But I am now made to feel the anger of GOD again&s;t me, for my di&s;obedience to my parent! GOD will not let di&s;obedient children pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Having got from under my mother's eye, I &s;till went on in my old way of &s;tealing; and not being permitted to live with the per|&s;on I cho&s;e to live with, I ran away from my ma&s;ter, which open|ed a wide door to temptation, and helped on my ruin; for being in|dolent in temper, and having no hone&s;t way of &s;upporting my&s;elf, I robbed others of their property.</P>
<P>About this time I &s;tole a gun at <HI>Woburn,</HI> from Mr. <HI>Jo&s;iah Richard|&s;on,</HI> and a large &s;ilver &s;poon from one Mr. <HI>Howard</HI> of the &s;ame town. I then broke open the &s;hop of Mr. <HI>Edward Hammond,</HI> in the county of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and took out a piece of broad-cloth and &s;ome money. I &s;tole between twenty and thirty dollars from another per&s;on, who&s;e name I have forgot. I broke open the &s;hop of Mr. <HI>Jonas Cutler,</HI> of <HI>Groton,</HI> and took from him a good piece of broad-cloth, a quantity of &s;ilk mitts, and &s;everal pieces of &s;ilk handkerchiefs. I al&s;o &s;tole a quantity of money from <HI>Jonathan Hammond,</HI> of <HI>Waltham,</HI> and a hat from <HI>Jonas Dix,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of the &s;ame place; and when in goal at <HI>Cam|bridge,</HI> I &s;tole a &s;ilver &s;poon which was brought from Mr. <HI>Braddi&s;h</HI>'s, the goal-keeper, for me to eat with. I robbed the Rev. Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> of <HI>Lexington,</HI> of a tankard, twelve tea-&s;poons, one large ditto, a pep|per-box, and two pair of &s;ugar tongs. I al&s;o &s;tole from Mr. <HI>Keith,</HI> at <HI>Natick,</HI> two coats and jackets, with which I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf when I came to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; I gave <HI>John Battle</HI> twenty dollars to make up the matter with Mr. <HI>Keith,</HI> being part of the money I &s;tole from
<PB N="32" REF="012862_0030_0F8B6E3D42B94018">
Mr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> of <HI>Waltham.</HI> I &s;tole ten or eleven dollars from Mr <HI>Symonds,</HI> of <HI>Lexington,</HI> who&s;e &s;on-in-law, Mr. <HI>Meriam,</HI> while I was in pri&s;on, informed me where the money was and how to get it, but he never received any of it; I &s;uppo&s;ed he gave me this information through envy again&s;t his father-in-law, through who&s;e means he was then confined for debt. I &s;tole a pair of &s;ilver buckles, and a pair of turned pumps out of a pair of &s;addle bags at <HI>Lea&s;on</HI>'s ta|vern in <HI>Waltham</HI>; the buckles were marked I. D. which I deliver|ed to a man at <HI>Marlborough</HI>&punc; a black&s;mith, to make up with him for &s;ome &s;tockings I took from him; his name I do not remember. I twi&s;ted a padlock and entered the cellar of a Mini&s;ter's hou&s;e at <HI>Marlborough,</HI> I then went up the cellar &s;tairs, lighted a candle in order to get &s;ome victuals. I have &s;everal times taken &s;undry arti|cles off of lines, hedges, fences, bu&s;hes, apple-trees, gra&s;s, &amp;c. but cannot recollect the owners. <HI>Thomas Cook</HI> and I &s;tole two great-coats and &s;old them. I have left three &s;hirts and &s;everal pair of &s;tockings at <HI>Scipio Burnam</HI>'s, at <HI>Newbury-Port</HI>: I then went by the name of <HI>I&s;aac Lawrence.</HI> I &s;tole an ax out of a cart and hid it in a &s;tone wall between <HI>Watertown</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> (the night before I took the money from Mr. <HI>Hammond</HI>) in <HI>Little Cambridge,</HI> near to Mr. <HI>Da|na</HI>'s tavern; there I left it with a de&s;ign to tell it when I came back. I broke open the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Rice,</HI> in <HI>Marlborough,</HI> on the Lord's-Day, while the people were gone to public wor&s;hip, having been advi&s;ed to it by <HI>Daniel Cook,</HI> when we were in <HI>Concord</HI> goal; was taken in the hou&s;e, and returned the things to the owner.</P>
<P>Some time la&s;t fall I &s;aw <HI>Thomas Cook,</HI> who told me he had &s;even pounds of plate hid, viz. a tankard, a number of table &s;poons, and one &s;oup ditto; the&s;e he dug up while I was with him; we car|ried them away from that place and hid them in a &s;tone wall, near a barn, clo&s;e to the &s;ign of the bull on <HI>Wrentham</HI> road, but he never informed me where he got them, or how he came by them; he of|fered me half if I would di&s;po&s;e of them, but I was afraid to do it.</P>
<P>La&s;t <HI>June</HI> an Iri&s;hman who called his name <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> of middle &s;tatute, much marked with the &s;mall-pox, told me that he know of a watch which was taken from his Excellency &s;ome time ago, and I &s;u&s;pected that he was the per&s;on who &s;tole it, becau&s;e he &s;aid he knew the Governor's hou&s;e well: He al&s;o a&s;&s;ured me that his Excellency had a con&s;iderable quantity of money in the hou&s;e, and a&s;ked me to go with him to get it. I denied, knowing that the Governor had many &s;ervants, which I urged as a rea&s;on why I would not join him. He &s;aid he had one to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, who&s;e name he would not tell me, unle&s;s I would be one of the party. He farther declared that he &s;hould go well armed with &s;words and pi&s;tols. Upon this I ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, becau&s;e I never thought of murdering any man, in the mid&s;t of all my &s;cene of thieving. He thought to prevail on me by telling me that there was a che&s;t of dollars in the hou&s;e but I would not go with them.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame month (June) I lodged at a tavern in <HI>Killing&s;ley</HI> or <HI>Pomfree,</HI> in <HI>Connecticut</HI> government, on the Lord's-day&punc; where I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and drank and went off without paying. A few evenings af+ter,
<PB N="33" REF="012862_0031_0F8B6E40357B8740">
I returned, &s;hoved up the window, and put in my hand and &s;tole a box with a johannes, &s;ome &s;mall change, a pair of knee buc|kles, and &s;leeve buttons, for which I was apprehended, confe&s;&s;ed the fact, returned the goods, was puni&s;hed and &s;et at liberty. The &s;ame night as above I took a hor&s;e out of <HI>Killing&s;ley,</HI> and rode him down to the county of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> where I broke open a &s;hop about day light, and took a quantity of coppers and a remnant of &s;attin: The owners have got them again. I al&s;o robbed a baker at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> of a quantity of coppers which I found in three ba&s;kets, and &s;pent them.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Atwood,</HI> in company with whom I committed that theft for which I am &s;oon to die, my acquaintance with him began in the following manner: I was &s;tanding at a countryman's cart in the market at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> a&s;king the price of a turkey; <HI>Atwood</HI> came up to me, and we fell into conver&s;ation; he a&s;ked me to walk with him to beacon-hill, which I did. We a&s;ked each other about the place of re&s;ort. I told him I lodged at Capt. <HI>Dickey</HI>'s. He &s;aid his money was all &s;pent, except one copper which he had in a &s;nuff|box. I a&s;ked him where he belonged? He &s;aid he was born in an i&s;land in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and that his parents lived in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land.</HI> I a&s;ked him where he had been? He told me he lately came from <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> I told him that &s;ince he had no money, if he would go with me to my lodgings, I would give him &s;ome dinner. I a&s;ked him what he would do with &s;ome &s;ilver plate, if he had any to di&s;|po&s;e of? He told me he knew of a gold-&s;mith who would take it, becau&s;e he had &s;old &s;ome to him before. I told him I knew where there was &s;ome, and if he would go with me, we would get it; to which he con&s;ented. We then went to <HI>Menotomy,</HI> and found it hid in a &s;tone wall. We kept it about us until next morning. He told me he knew of a vendue-ma&s;ter in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> with whom he had lived, who had a large &s;um of money by him, and if I would join him we would get it. I a&s;ked who it was? he &s;aid Mr. <HI>Bicker.</HI> We ac|cordingly agreed to &s;teal it. At night, after we had &s;lept, we went to a joiner's &s;hop, into which I entered and took out three chizels; we then went to Mr. <HI>Bicker</HI>'s hou&s;e, and on the way were hailed by a watchman, to whom we an&s;wered, friends. Having come to Mr. <HI>Bicker</HI>'s hou&s;e, we found a front chamber window open; we pul|led off our &s;hoes, and <HI>Jo&s;eph Atwood</HI> with my a&s;&s;i&s;tance climbed up to the window and entered the hou&s;e, and opened the doors for me; we then went together to the de&s;k, which we broke open with the chizels. <HI>Atwood</HI> pulled out the fir&s;t drawer, and &s;aid there was &s;mall change in it, which was all he could find. As he was going away, I pulled out another drawer, in which I found a bag of &s;ilver coin. After that we came out and went to fox-hill, near the powder-hou&s;e, there we hid the plate, which we had kept in our pockets while we were at &s;upper, and when we entered Mr. <HI>Bicker</HI>'s hou&s;e. The &s;mall change in &s;ilver which <HI>Atwood</HI> took were equally divided, though the gold which <HI>Atwood</HI> had then &s;ecreted I knew nothing of, nor did he ever give me any of it. Before &s;un&s;et I &s;aw him at Mr. <HI>Bell</HI>'s, when he informed me that a warrant was out for me; he went with me to <HI>Wini&s;imit,</HI> and advi&s;ed me to go over the ferry, promi&s;ing to
<PB N="34" REF="012862_0032_0F8B6E405D194F70">
meet me at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> the Wedne&s;day following at the hou&s;e to which he was taken. I returned again to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to &s;ee if any of my cloaths were done which I had be&s;poke; on Saturday I was taken by Mr. <HI>Bicker</HI> and committed to goal, and &s;aw <HI>Atwood</HI> no more un|til I &s;aw him in the pri&s;on-yard after he was apprehended.</P>
<P>Thus have I given an account of that &s;hocking manner in which I have filled up a &s;hort life, and of which I am now a&s;hamed. May GOD forgive me my dreadful wickedne&s;s, committed both again&s;t him, and many worthy men, of whom al&s;o I would a&s;k forgivene&s;s, it being not in my power to make re&s;titution, which if it was I would readily do it. I al&s;o forgive from my heart <HI>Jo&s;eph Atwood,</HI> who &s;wore on my trial that I entered the hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Bicker</HI> fir&s;t, and let him in, when he knows in his con&s;cience that he entered fir&s;t and let me in. I die in charity with all mankind. But though I lived &s;uch a wicked life it was not without &s;ome &s;evere checks of con|&s;cience. For after I had &s;tolen, I have been &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at times, as to be obliged to go back and throw the &s;tolen goods at the door, or into the yard, that the owners might have them again. And not long before I was taken for this la&s;t robbery, I pa&s;&s;ed the gallows on <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> neck with &s;ome &s;tolen goods under my arm; when my con&s;cience ter|ribly &s;mote me, and I thought I &s;hould &s;urely die there, if I did not leave off this cour&s;e of life. What I then feared is now come upon me.</P>
<P>Having thus given an account of my dreadful life of wickedne&s;s, I would al&s;o mention the manner in which I have conducted, and my mind has been exerci&s;ed during my confinement in goal, &s;ince the awful &s;entence of DEATH was pa&s;&s;ed upon me.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I had &s;ecret hopes of e&s;cape; that I &s;hould by &s;ome means get out of pri&s;on. When I &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;ible, I endeavored to re|concile my&s;elf as well as I could. My con&s;cience made me unea&s;y; I thought I had been &s;o wicked that I &s;hould certainly go to hell. And when I con&s;idered how &s;hort my time was, I knew I could not do good works to go to heaven. To hell then I was &s;ure I &s;hould go. And I &s;eemed to have &s;uch an awful &s;ight of hell and the grave, that I was very much terrified indeed; I then took to drinking &s;trong liquor an order to drown my &s;orrow. But this would not do; I left that off and took to reading my bible; my con&s;cience be|came &s;o unea&s;y, that I could have no re&s;t. O! a wounded con&s;cience who can bear? I tried to pray; but it came into my mind that the prayers of the wicked would not be heard. Yet I could not help crying for mercy. I was at times ready to de&s;pair of the mer|cy of GOD. But the mini&s;ters who vi&s;ited me, a&s;&s;ured me that the blood of CHRIST was &s;ufficient to clean&s;e me from all &s;in, which gave me a little encouragement to go on crying to GOD. I now began to under&s;tand &s;omething of that law of GOD which I had broken, at condemning me for the wickedne&s;s of my heart as well as life. I &s;aw that I was undone, that my heart and life were bad beyond all account. I &s;aw that if GOD &s;hould damn me a thou|&s;and times he would be ju&s;t, and I &s;hould have nothing to &s;ay. In this condition I was a week before the time fixed for my execu|tion. The lo&s;s of body and &s;oul made me tremble; though I could not freely tell all that I felt to all who came to &s;ee me. I
<PB N="35" REF="012862_0033_0F8B6E41D461F8C8">
thought that if I &s;hould be executed in this condition, I mu&s;t be dragged like a bullock to the &s;laughter.</P>
<P>But GOD's name be ble&s;&s;ed forever; that on Friday evening, the 8th in&s;tant, I turned over a little book which was put into my hands, in which I &s;aw, Ezek. 36.26, 27. <HI>A new heart will I give you, and a new &s;pirit will I put upon you: And I will take away the &s;tony heart out of your fle&s;h, and I will give you a heart of fle&s;h. And I will pour out my &s;pirit upon you,</HI> &amp;c. This at once &s;urprized me: I knew that I wanted this new heart, and could not help looking on this as GOD's gracious promi&s;e to me: And I thought that as I knew GOD could not lie, if I would not believe this, I would believe no|thing: My mind at once felt ea&s;y. I now &s;aw that I had &s;inned again&s;t GOD all my life with as much envy, as ever I killed a &s;nake; which I always hated.</P>
<P>After this I had, and now have &s;uch a view of the way of &s;alva|tion by CHRIST, that I felt and do feel my &s;oul re&s;t on him as my only hope of &s;alvation. Since which I have found peace of mind, anger again&s;t my&s;elf for &s;in, and a de&s;ire to be made holy. At times the terrors of death &s;eem to be removed; at other times I am full of fears le&s;t I &s;hould deceive my&s;elf. Yet I cannot but hope that CHRIST has freely pardoned me. On him I de&s;ire to re&s;t liv|ing and dying; and to give him all the prai&s;e.</P>
<P>And now as a dying man I mention the following things, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. To keep your doors and windows &s;hut on evenings, and &s;ecur|ed well to prevent temptation. And by no means to u&s;e &s;mall locks on the out&s;ide, one of which I have twi&s;ted with ea&s;e when tempted to &s;teal. Al&s;o not to leave linnen or clothes out at night, which have often proved a &s;nare to me. Travellers I advi&s;e to &s;ecure their faddle bags, boots. &amp;c. in the chambers where they lodge.</P>
<P N="2">2. Parents and ma&s;ters I entreat you who have any concern for, and connection with children, to have an eye over their actions, and to take &s;pecial care for their precious and immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P N="3">3. All Per&s;ons whether old or young, who may &s;ee the&s;e lines, &s;poke as it were by a poor, dying &s;inful man, now bound in chains, and who has but a &s;hort &s;pace of time before he mu&s;t launch into an endle&s;s eternity; guard again&s;t every temptation to &s;in. If at any time you are tempted to do any thing like the poor &s;oul who now &s;peaks to you, earne&s;tly pray to GOD for &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the temp|tation, as well as for repentance for your pa&s;t &s;ins.</P>
<P>The youth more e&s;pecially I would &s;olemnly caution again&s;t the vices to which they are mo&s;t inclined&mdash;Such as <HI>bad woman,</HI> who have undone many, and by whom I al&s;o have &s;uffered much; the unlawful intercou&s;e with them I have found by &s;ad experience, lea|ding to almo&s;t every &s;in. I al&s;o warn them to guard again&s;t the fir&s;t temptation to <HI>di&s;obedience to parents.</HI> Had I regarded the many kind intreaties and reproofs of my tender Mother, I had never come to this &s;hameful and untimely death.</P>
<P>Profane <HI>cur&s;ing and &s;wearing</HI> I al&s;o bear my dying te&s;timony again&s;t, as a horrid &s;in, and provoking to GOD.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t I omit to mention <HI>gaming,</HI> to which young people are much inclined, and which at this day prevails to the ruin of many.

For when a youth hath gamed away all his money, he well be temp|ted even to &s;teal from his ma&s;ter or parents, in order to get at it again. Be&s;ides, this &s;in leads to <HI>drunkenne&s;s</HI> another dreadful vice.</P>
<P>There is one &s;in more that I mu&s;t warn all per&s;ons again&s;t, and that is, <HI>a profanation of the Lord's day, and of public wor&s;hip.</HI> Oh! how many &s;uch days have I de&s;pi&s;ed, and while others have been engaged in &s;erving GOD, I have been employed in wickedne&s;s, which I now confe&s;s with grief of heart.</P>
<P N="4">4. I have one reque&s;t more to make from the borders of the grave, a compliance with which is earne&s;tly de&s;ired by a poor dying mor|tal; which is, that no per&s;on, old or young, would ever reflect on my poor dear mother, or brother, or any of my relations, on account of my &s;hameful and untimely death, who could not prevent my wickedne&s;s, and have trouble too much to be borne, by the life I have lived, and the death I am to die.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire &s;incerely to thank all the good Mini&s;ters of the town, who have taken great pains with me ever &s;ince the &s;entence of death was pa&s;t upon me, to convince me of my unhappy &s;ituation, of my lo&s;t and undone condition by nature, of my aggravating &s;ins by prac|tice, and of the infinitely free rich grace and mercy of God, only thro' the merits and mediation of my dear Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I al&s;o thank all the good people both of town and country, who, I have rea|&s;on to think, have offered up many prayers at the throne of grace for me. I al&s;o thank Mr. <HI>Otis,</HI> the goal-keeper and his family, who have all been very kind to me during my confinement in goal. LA MES.</P>
<P>&rindx; <HI>Ames</HI> was attended to the place of execution by the rev. <HI>Sa|muel Stillman,</HI> one of the bapti&s;t-mini&s;ters in this town, who con|&s;tantly vi&s;ited and prayed with him while he was under confinement, and &s;pared no pains to reform and bring him to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his un|happy condition and guilt; in &s;hort, &s;uch was the a&s;&s;iduity of that reverend and pious Gentleman, that his utmo&s;t efforts were not want|ing, in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on, to &s;it and prepare him for a future <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">: So great affection and concern did he &s;hew for the future wel|fare of this unfortunate young creature, that while he was accom|panying him to the fatal tree, with tears in his eyes, he cla&s;ped this young convert round his wai&s;t, and &s;eemed to take the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction in conver&s;ing with him about the things that concerned his everla&s;ting happine&s;s; to &s;um up the whole in a few words, his whole deportment, in his agreeable moments &s;pent in his travel, &s;eemed to be&s;peak, <HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.</HI> The Pri&s;oner was turned off ju&s;t at four o'clock, having fir&s;t given a &s;hort but pathetic exhortation to the va&s;t con|cour&s;e of people, who attended this awful &s;cene, &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of &s;even or eight thou&s;and per&s;ons, and particularly the YOUTH, who he earne&s;tly entreated to avoid <HI>Stealing,</HI> the crime which he was mo&s;t addicted to, and for which he was to &s;uffer an ignominious death. He took by the hand Mr. <HI>Edward Ranger,</HI> hou&s;ewright, (a mem|ber of Mr. <HI>Stillman's</HI> church) and returned him and Mrs. <HI>Ranger</HI> thanks for their kindne&s;s to him. After which he made a &s;hort prayer, and &s;eemed to die a true penitent, without &s;carce a &s;truggle.</P>
