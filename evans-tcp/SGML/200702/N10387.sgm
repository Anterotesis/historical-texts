<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN Times of publick Danger, every Man has a Right to offer his Advice; there are &s;ome Men who think it their Duty to do it, although on common Occa&s;ions they may be naturally too diffident of their own Opinions, or too indolent, to give them&s;elves the Trouble to obtrude them on the World. If &s;uch Men happen to mi&s;take their Talents, not from Vanity but from an Exce&s;s of Zeal, and meddle officiou&s;ly with Matters above their Reach, they may be forgiven on the Score of their Intention: Even a mode&s;t Man is apt to over-rate his own Judgment where his Affections and Intere&s;ts are deeply concerned.</P>
<P>MY Zeal therefore in the common Cau&s;e mu&s;t &s;erve for my Excu&s;e, if in the Cour&s;e of this Letter I &s;hould give my Opinion more confidently than I ought to do, and &s;eem to think my&s;elf, which is a very common Ca&s;e, much wi&s;er than I am.</P>
<P>YOU are &s;oon to meet on the mo&s;t &s;erious Occa&s;ion that ever pre&s;ented it&s;elf to this Country &s;ince its Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THE Harmony which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, with little or no Interruption, between Great-Britain and her Colonies, from their very Infancy until of late, is in Danger of being de&s;troyed for ever. The Habits of Kindne&s;s and Affection, on one Side, and of Re&s;pect and Obedience, on the
<PB N="4" REF="013167_0003_0F8EC6F8E17C3460">
other, (which prevailed during &s;o long a Period, were in the highe&s;t Degree conducive to the Pro&s;perity of this Country in particular, and are &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to its Security and Happine&s;s) are changed into Murmurings, Di&s;contents, and Reproaches; and will &s;oon end, without &s;ome very extraordinary Interpo&s;ition, in mutual and implacable Hatred. Complaints of Grie|vances, real or imaginary, are heard from one End of the&s;e Colonies to the other; the Minds of the People appear to be agitated as at &s;ome great Cri&s;is; they wi&s;h, by a publick Con&s;ul|tation, to be a&s;&s;ured of the general Opinion, by a Repre&s;entation of every Province, to collect the calm, deliberate Determination of all the Provinces, to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome publick Mark of mutual Confidence, that they may hold it up to the Parent Country, in all its Weight and Importance. For this Purpo&s;e, Gentlemen, you are delegated to the Congre&s;s. An ab&s;olute, perfect Repre&s;entation of the People, never ex|i&s;ted perhaps, but in Theory. You, it is true, have not been &s;ummoned, or convened, by any formal con&s;titutional Authority, or inve&s;ted with any legi&s;lative Powers: But you have been cho|&s;en as freely as the Circum&s;tances of the Times would admit; with le&s;s Cabal and Intrigue than is u&s;ually employed for a Seat in many of our legal provincial A&s;&s;emblies, and without even the Su&s;picion of Venality, which is but too frequently and too generally practi&s;ed among us for that Purpo&s;e. Your Per&s;ons, Characters, and Principles, are familiarly known to your
<PB N="5" REF="013167_0004_0F8EC6F9C29D5790">
Con&s;tituents; you have been recommended by the mo&s;t Honourable of all Intere&s;ts, the ge|neral Opinion of your Knowledge, Abilities and Virtues. We look up to you as the Oracles of our Country; your Opinions will have the Effect of Laws, on the Minds of the People, and your Re&s;olves may decide the Fate of A|merica. All Orders of Men, who enjoy the Happine&s;s of living under a free Government, may boldly a&s;&s;ume the Character of Politicians; they inherit a Right to it as much as the proude&s;t Peer inherits a Right to his Seat in Parliament, however ridiculous the Propor|tion may appear to the Conceit and Arrogance of Men who think them&s;elves born to domi|neer over their fellow Creatures at Plea&s;ure. High Birth and Fortune, when they are not a|bu&s;ed, confer the &s;olid and &s;plendid Advantages of Education and Accompli&s;hments, exten&s;ive Influence, and incitement to Glory; but they give no exclu&s;ive Title to Common Sen&s;e, Wi&s;dom, or Integrity. The lowe&s;t Orders of Men in &s;uch a Country, have an unalienable Property in their Indu&s;try, their Liberty, and their Lives, and may be allowed to &s;et &s;ome Va|lue at lea&s;t on the only Property they can boa&s;t of: The&s;e may be all endanger'd, or lo&s;t, by the Conduct of their Governors, they have there|fore a Right, as Freemen, to examine their Con|duct, to cen&s;ure, to condemn it; without this Right the free&s;t Government on Earth would &s;oon degenerate into the ranke&s;t Tyranny. The great Out-lines, the fundamental Principles of
<PB N="6" REF="013167_0005_0F8EC6FA6E366DD8">
out Con&s;titution, are within the Reach of al|mo&s;t every Man's Capacity; they require little more than Lei&s;ure to &s;tudy them, Memory to retain them, and Candour to form a true Judg|ment of them; unhappily for the Order and Peace of Society, this ine&s;timable Privilege is but too often abu&s;ed. Men in general are go|vern'd more by their Temper than their Judg|ment; they have little Lei&s;ure and &s;till le&s;s In|clination, to inform them&s;elves exactly of the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;titutional Powers of the &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, or of their own legal Rights; they have been often told that Liberty is a very great Ble&s;&s;ing; they talk ince&s;&s;antly of it, they find &s;omething inchanting in the very Sound of the Word; a&s;k them the Meaning of it, they think you de&s;ign to affront them; pu&s;h them to a Definition, they give you at once a De&s;crip|tion of the State of Nature. Their Ideas of the Nature, Origin and Conditions of civil Society in general, are ju&s;t as confus'd and inaccurate; they take their political as they do their religious Opinions (upon Tru&s;t) from the Nur&s;ery, the Company they fall into, or the Profe&s;&s;ions and Scenes in which they are accidentally en|gaged. They find the Movement of the Pa&s;&s;ions a more ea&s;y and agreeable Exerci&s;e than the Drudgery of &s;ober and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Enquiry. Hand Bills, News Papers, party Pamphlets, are the &s;hallow and turbid Sources from whence they derive their Notions of Go|vernment; the&s;e they pronounce as confidently and dogmatically, as if a political Problem
<PB N="7" REF="013167_0006_0F8EC6FB8DB19998">
was to be &s;olved as clearly as a Mathematical one; and as if a bold A&s;&s;ertion amounted to a Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>AMBITION and Lu&s;t of Power above the Laws, are &s;uch predominant Pa&s;&s;ions in the Brea&s;ts of mo&s;t Men, even of Men who e&s;cape the Infection of other Vices, that Liberty, legal Liberty, would be in continual Danger of En|croachments, if it were not guarded by perpe|tual Jealou&s;y. Crafty de&s;igning Knaves, tur|bulent Demagogues, Quacks in Politics, and Impo&s;tors in Patrioti&s;m, have in all free Go|vernments, and in all Ages, avail'd them&s;elves of this nece&s;&s;ary Spirit of Jealou&s;y; and by broaching Doctrines unknown to the Con&s;titu|tion, under the Name of con&s;titutional Princi|ples, by bold A&s;&s;ertions, partial Repre&s;enta|tions, fal&s;e Colourings, wre&s;ted Con&s;tructions, and tragical Declamations, have frequently impo&s;ed on the Credulity of the well-meaning deluded Multitude. Thus the mo&s;t honourable Cau&s;e that wi&s;e and good Men can engage in, the Cau&s;e of Liberty, has been often di&s;graced; Nations once as free and as happy as our&s;elves, have been frighten'd into Anarchy, plung'd into all the Horrors of a civil War, and ended their mi&s;erable Career in the mo&s;t humiliating and abject Slavery, until the &s;acred Name of Liberty has become a Word of Scorn and Mockery in the Mouths of Tyrants, and their abandoned Minions and Emi&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>SUCH are the Calamities which have fre|quently ari&s;en from an ardent mi&s;taken Zeal,
<PB N="8" REF="013167_0007_0F8EC6FC050460C8">
and from the fal&s;e Refinements of &s;peculative Men, who amu&s;e them&s;leves and the World, with vi&s;ionary Ideas of Perfection, which never were, nor ever will be found, either in publick or in private Life. You, Gentlemen, cannot even be &s;u&s;pected of being under the Influence of &s;uch Delu&s;ions; there are many among you who are eminently learned, not only in the Laws of the Land, but in the Laws of Nature and Nations, in the general Laws of Rea&s;on and Ju&s;|tice, who know their Authority and revere them, not as they have been &s;ometimes explained on the narrow illiberal Principles of party Spirit, but as they have been under&s;tood, and acknow|ledg'd by the Wi&s;e of all Ages, and have &s;erved for the Ba&s;is of the mo&s;t perfect Sy&s;tems of Legi&s;lation. The&s;e are the only Rules by which all political Opinions ought to be tried and examin'd, by which an hone&s;t Man and a good Citizen, can form a true Judgment of the Duty he owes to his King and his Country.</P>
<P>IT would have been happy for the World on many melancholy Occa&s;ions, that the revealed Will of God, which ought to be the &s;ole Rule of every Man's Conduct, the only tran&s;cendent Authority from which there lies no Appeal, had never received but one general Interpreta|tion with Regard to the reciprocal Duties of the Sovereign and the People; but even that &s;acred and eternal Standard of Right and Wrong, in private Life has been alternately perverted and profan'd in the political World, by the indi&s;creet Zeal and wild Pa&s;&s;ions of
<PB N="9" REF="013167_0008_0F8EC70097026180">
mad Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, or &s;alvi&s;h Bigots, has been equally abu&s;ed, to &s;erve the Purpo&s;es of a Charles or a Cromwell, of a Gregory, or a Venner, to throw a Veil over the Horrors of Anarchy, and Rebellion, or to &s;anctify the ridiculous and damnable Doctrines of Non-re&s;i&s;tance, and Pa&s;|&s;ive-Obedience, on a proper Application of the general Doctrines, and Principles, I have mention'd, to the peculiar and local Circum|&s;tances of this Country; your Proceedings, and Re&s;olves, ought to depend, by a competent Knowledge of the Character of the Times, when the Colony Charters were granted; of the Kings, by whom they were granted; of the People, to whom they were granted; of the Purpo&s;es for which they were a&s;k'd and ob|tained; of the Tenor and Spirit of the Charters them&s;elves, how they were under&s;tood, and con|&s;trued by our Ance&s;tors; by a Knowledge in &s;hort of the Hi&s;tory of our Country, we may di&s;cover the general Con&s;titution of the Colo|nies, and be able to judge whether the pre&s;ent Di&s;contents are founded on Truth or Ignorance.</P>
<P>BY a due and candid Examination of this very intere&s;ting Subject, it may perhaps appear, that the Character of the Times, when mo&s;t of the Charters were originally granted, bore very lit|tle Re&s;emblance to the pre&s;ent Times; that the ine&s;timable Privileges of a modern Engli&s;hman, might indeed be found in &s;ome Degree, in the Letter of the Law, but had never been en|joyed, were generally very imperfectly under|&s;tood, and rarely claimed by our Ance&s;tors;
<PB N="10" REF="013167_0009_0F8EC701CDD89F68">
that even the&s;e legal con&s;titutional Privileges were encumbered with a Thou&s;and legal Cu&s;|toms, which they patiently &s;ubmitted to, altho' they would exceed the Patience of a modern Frenchman; that they felt and di&s;cover'd infi|nitely more Zeal, for their religious, than for their civil Liberty, and would have been con|tented with half the Privileges their Po&s;terity enjoy, for an Act of Toleration. It will appear, that the Kings, by whom the Charters were granted, were not de&s;potick Kings, that they con&s;titutionally po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the executive, not the &s;upreme legi&s;lative Power, of which they only made a Part; that in all Que&s;tions of Magni|tude, they were under the Control of the other parts of the legi&s;lative Power. That our An|ce&s;tors, were Subjects of the Kings of England, not as the Inhabitants of Guyenne formerly were, or as tho&s;e of the Electorate of Hanover are now, but Subjects of an Engli&s;h Parlia|mentary King; Engli&s;hmen in the fulle&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word, with the &s;ame Habits and Man|ners, &s;peaking the &s;ame Language, govern'd by the &s;ame Maxims, Cu&s;toms and Laws, with &s;carce any Di&s;tinction, but the Latitude and Longitude of their new Re&s;idence.</P>
<P>THAT if their Charters were granted with|out the Concurrence of Parliaments, it was not becau&s;e a Parliament had no Right to interfere, but becau&s;e they did not in tho&s;e Days appear of Importance enough to be agitated in the great Council of the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="013167_0010_0F8EC7021776C660">
THAT altho' by their Charters, our Ance&s;|tors were empowered to make By-Laws for their own local Convenience, they were never|thele&s;s expre&s;sly and formally re&s;train'd from making Laws repugnant to the Laws of En|gland; and were univer&s;ally under&s;tood, both there, and here, to owe in Common with all Engli&s;hmen, an Obedience to the Laws, from which no King could relea&s;e them, becau&s;e no King could di&s;pen&s;e with the Laws. That from this parliamentary Authority, they never wi&s;h'd until of late, to be emancipated, but would rather have fled to it for Protection, from the arbitrary Encroachments of a James, or a Charles, armed with the U&s;urpations, and Abu&s;es, of privy Seals, Benevolences, Procla|mations, Star Chambers and High Commi&s;&s;ion Courts, and from the Enormities of the two &s;ucceeding Reigns; that &s;uch were the Prac|tices of the Times, when our early Charters bear their Dates, that if they were not granted by parliamentary Kings, they were granted by Tyrants, and we &s;hall gain nothing by recur|ring to fir&s;t Principles.</P>
<P>THAT no political Society can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s there be an ab&s;olute &s;upreme Power lodg'd &s;omewhere in the Society, has been univer&s;ally held as an uncontrolable Maxim in Theory, by all Writers on Government, from Ari&s;totle down to Sidney and Lock, and has been as univer&s;ally adopted in Practice, from the De&s;po|ti&s;m of Morocco, to the Republic of St. Mari|no; as long as Government &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, Subjects
<PB N="12" REF="013167_0011_0F8EC702A42E96A8">
owe an implicit Obedience to the Laws of the &s;upreme Power, from which there can be no Appeal but to Heaven. We for &s;ome Years pa&s;t have been multiplying ineffectual Re|&s;elves, Petitions, and Remon&s;trances, and advancing Claims of Rights, &amp;c. Our Petitions have at la&s;t been neglected, or rejected, or cen&s;ured; the Principles on which we found our Claims, have been formally denied. To what, or to whom, &s;hall we have Recour&s;e? Shall we appeal to the King of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, to the King of Connecticut, to the King of Rhode I&s;land, again&s;t the King of Great Britain, to re&s;cind the Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, to di&s;pen&s;e with the Laws, to which as a nece&s;&s;ary and efficient Part of that Body, he has &s;o recently given his A&s;&s;ent? Ridiculous as the&s;e Que&s;tions may appear, I am afraid they are but too much of a Piece with Doctrines which have been lately broached, inculcated every where, and almo&s;t every where receiv'd. The Colonies are con&s;titutionally in|dependant of each other: They formally ac|knowledge them&s;elves loyal, and dutiful Sub|jects of his Maje&s;ty GEORGE the Third. But &s;everally claim an Exemption from the Autho|rity of the Briti&s;h Parliament. A Doctrine &s;o repugnant to the Ideas of all our Fellow-Sub|jects in Great Britain, can I tru&s;t, have no Place in your A&s;&s;embly. The Bu&s;ine&s;s you have to tranfact, is too &s;erious to be trifled with; the Confidence repo&s;ed in you, too &s;acred to be &s;acrificed to idle Sophi&s;try and vi&s;ionary Di&s;|tinctions; the Fate of America, may depend
<PB N="13" REF="013167_0012_0F8EC703831A5B78">
on your Re&s;olves; they &s;hould be founded on Principles that are plain, and intelligible, that are marked with the Authority of univer&s;al Opinions and Truths.</P>
<P>THE &s;upreme Power of the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment over her Colonies, was ever till very lately, as univer&s;ally acknowledg'd, by our&s;elves, as by our Fellow-Subjects in England. It u&s;urps no Claim to infallibility in its Opinions, but gives the Subject of legal Right of petitioning, remon&s;trating, of propo&s;ing Plans of Refor|mation, and Redre&s;s. Neverthele&s;s, tho' it pretends not to Infallibility, like all other Go|vernments, it requires an implicit Obedience to its Laws, and has a Right to enforce it. A Tribe of Savages, unre&s;trained by Laws, human or divine, may live in &s;ome Harmony, and endure for Ages, becau&s;e in the State of Nature, there are at the mo&s;t but two or three Subjects, to contend about, and the Individuals are recipro|cally over-awed by the natural Rights of private Revenge. But in civil Soceity, compo&s;ed as in commonly is, of &s;uch an infinite Number of heterogeneous and di&s;cordant Principles and Intere&s;ts, in Trade, in Politics, and Religion, where Subjects of Contention pre&s;ent them&s;elves by Thou&s;ands every Hour; no Con&s;titution can &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Moment, without a con&s;tant Re&s;ig|nation of private Judgment, to the Judgment of the Publick.</P>
<P>WHAT Part then, Gentlemen, have you left you to act, but to propo&s;e, with the Mode&s;ty of Subjects, &s;ome practicable Plan of Accom|modation,
<PB N="14" REF="013167_0013_0F8EC70429890E80">
and to obey? Shall the Time of &s;o re&s;pectable an A&s;&s;embly be &s;quandered, in ad|vancing Claims of Right, that have been urged, and rejected a thou&s;and Times; that have been heard, con&s;idered, &s;olemnly debated, and de|cided by the only Power on Earth, who has a Right to decide them? Shall the Opinions and De&s;ires of a &s;mall Part of the Community, prevail again&s;t the Opinions, and De&s;ires of the Majority of the Community? What new Species of Eloquence can be invented to per|&s;uade? What new Logick to convince the Under&s;tandings of our Fellow-Subjects? Shall the Briti&s;h Senate be governed by the pernici|ous Maxims of a Poli&s;h Diet, and the Veto of a &s;ingle Member, or of a few Members, how|ever di&s;tingui&s;hed by extraordinary Wi&s;dom, and Virtue, ob&s;truct or &s;u&s;pend, or annul the Legi&s;lation of a great Nation?</P>
<P>THOSE wi&s;e and virtuous Citizens them&s;elves hold &s;uch Doctrines in Deri&s;ion. While a Que&s;|tion is in Agitation, they debate with Freedom, but they claim no blind Submi&s;&s;ion to their Opinions, no Authority, but the Authority of their Arguments. They arrogate not to them|&s;elves, a Monopoly of all the Wi&s;dom, and all the Virtue in the Nation. When the Que&s;tion is decided, they &s;ubmit their private &s;peculative Opinions, to the Opinion of the Majority, to the Law of the Land. They revere the Law, and make it the Rule of their Conduct.</P>
<P>You therefore, Gentlemen, the Delegates of a very numerous, and re&s;pectable People, will
<PB N="15" REF="013167_0014_0F8EC7052A1E0738">
&s;urely think it below the Dignity of your Cha|racter, to a&s;&s;emble with the Pa&s;&s;ions and Lan|guage of a common Town Meeting, to &s;it in Judgment, like &s;ome foreign Imperial Power on the Decrees of a Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature; to arraign the Conduct of Admini&s;tration, in the lofty emphatick Tone of a Manife&s;to. Can &s;uch Pro|ceedings an&s;wer any Purpo&s;e, but the dan|gerous Purpo&s;es of exa&s;perating and provoking the Indignation and Vengeance of the Orders and Degrees of Men in the parent Country? Of alienating the Affections of the People here, &s;educing them from their Allegiance, inflaming their Pa&s;&s;ions, and exciting them to popular Tumults, and In&s;urrections? The Order and Tranquillity of Government frequently de|pends more upon the Manners and Morals of the People, than upon their Laws and In&s;titu|tions. For the Honour of our native Country, there are I believe, few In&s;tances on Record, of any People under a free Government, who have pa&s;&s;ed thro' the &s;ame Length of Period, with &s;o few civil Commotions, tho' the Powers of Government have never been vigilantly ex|erted, nor the Laws held in any extraordinary Veneration. But the Manners and Morals of our Countrymen, are undebauched and inno|cent, compared with tho&s;e of the Inhabitants of older Countries, where the In&s;truments of Corruption, and the Incitements of Vices and Crimes are more general. The Danger is never|thele&s;s the &s;ame, or greater. There are no Peo|ple on Earth more &s;ecure from the humilitaing

Effects of Poverty, more &s;uperiour to the Smiles, or Frowns of Power, more unawed by the Di&s;tictions of Birth and Fortune, more confident, or tenacious of their own Opinions, or more on a level with all the World in their Conver&s;ation and Behaviour. The Pa&s;&s;ions of &s;uch Men, agitated by fal&s;e Principles, and mi&s;|taken Zeal, are more dangerous to the Repo&s;e of the World, than the Frenzy of the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute, and abandon'd Slaves. You will &s;urely beware how you inflame the Minds of &s;uch ho|ne&s;t deluded Citizens, or the Time may come, perhaps it is not very di&s;tant, that you will wi&s;h, when it will be too late, to calm the Storm you have rai&s;ed, and will tremble every Moment, le&s;t it bur&s;t on your own Heads.</P>
<P>UPON the Subject of a Non-Importation and Non-Exportation Agreement, I am at a Lo&s;s what to &s;ay, it has been &s;o often and &s;o warmly recommended, as a &s;pecific Remedy for all our Complaints, has received the Sanction of &s;uch General Authority, that I am afraid it will look like an affront to the Under&s;tandings of my Fellow Citizens, an Apo&s;tacy from my native Country to in&s;inuate the lea&s;t Doubt of its Efficacy. Yet let me mo&s;t earne&s;tly conjure you, by the common Love we bear to that Country, by the Gratitude we owe to the parent Country, by the important Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you, as you value your pre&s;ent and future Peace, and the Intere&s;ts and Happine&s;s of your Po&s;terity, Beware how you adopt that Mea&s;ure, how you engage in that &s;trange conflict of Sullenne&s;s and
<PB N="17" REF="013167_0016_0F8EC705A172E978">
Ob&s;tinacy, till you have given it the mo&s;t calm and &s;erious Deliberation.</P>
<P>THE efficacy of the Mea&s;ure, admitting it to be a practicable one, depends, I pre&s;ume, upon the Importance of our Commerce with Great-Britain; it is po&s;&s;ible that People in general here, may have been much deceived, in this Matter, by partial and exaggerated Calculations, made under particular Circum&s;tances, during particualr. Periods, to &s;erve the Prupo&s;es of Party. It would be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the exact Value of it.

The Re&s;ources of her Trade are infinite, the Combinations of it, too various and complicated, the Revolutions of it, too &s;udden and frequent, to be ea&s;ily explained, or under&s;tood. But we may judge of it, by the Re&s;ult, and Effect of the whole, whenever the a&s;toni&s;hing Power of the Nation is called forth into Exertion. Can we &s;eriou&s;ly believe, that this Wealth, and Power, is derived almo&s;t entirely, from her North-Ame|rican Colonies? Can we, (who by our own Confe&s;&s;ions do not yet enjoy even all the Nece&s;|&s;aries of Life) can we re&s;onably hope, to &s;tarve into Compliance, &s;o great, and &s;o powerful a Nation? Shall we puni&s;h our&s;elves, like froward Children, who refu&s;e to eat, when they are Hungry, that they may vex their indulgent Mothers? Or like de&s;perate Game&s;ters, &s;take at one throw, our &s;mall, but competent, and happy Fortunes, again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Stakes, the accummulated Wealth of Ages? We may teize the Mother Country, we cannot ruin her. Let us beware how we engage in &s;uch an unequal Conte&s;t, le&s;t while we are giving her a &s;light Wound, we receive a Mortal one.</P>
<P>IF notwith&s;tanding, we are confident, that the Mea&s;ure of a Non-Importation, and Non-Exportation Agreement, bids fair to be a &s;ucce&s;sful one; it certainly behoves us as Men, and as Chri&s;tians to be &s;ure, that it is a ju&s;t Mea&s;ure. A Combination to Ruin, or to ob&s;truct

<P>FOR the Sake of common Humanity, Gen|tlemen, di&s;dain to co-operate, with Hand Bills, with News Papers, with the high menacing Re&s;olves of common Town Meetings; do not con&s;pire with them, to reduce, under the Pains, and Penalties of Di&s;grace, and Infamy, Thou|&s;ands of your Fellow Citizens, to the cruel Alternative, of involving them&s;elves, their Wives, and Children, in Indigence, and Wretch|edne&s;s; or of being publicly branded, and pointed out by the frantic Multitude, as Apo&s;|tates, and Traitors to their Country.</P>

There are Thou&s;ands of hone&s;t indu&s;trious Fa|milies, who have no Re&s;ources, but in the Con&s;equences of Exportation, and Importation. Shall we levy a Tax. upon the&s;e innocent Citizens, a Tax unheard of, di&s;proportionate, a Tax, never &s;ugge&s;ted by the mo&s;t inhuman Tyrant? A Tax, to the Amount of their daily Bread?

Altho' it is little more, than a temporary Su&s;|pen&s;ion, of the Trade, of that City, until Re&s;ti|tution, which God, and Man calls aloud for, be made. And altho' the Ports, at a very &s;mall Di&s;tance from Bo&s;ton, and every other Port on the Continent, is as free as ever, &s;hall we multiply the&s;e Calamities, ten Thou&s;and Fold? For &s;uch Calamities, mu&s;t be the inevitable Con&s;equences, of a Non-Importation, and Non-Exportation Agreement.

We have advanced from one extravagant Claim to another, made &s;uch &s;udden Turnings, and Windings, taken &s;uch wild, and rapid Flights, that the bolde&s;t of our Followers, can follow us no longer; our mo&s;t zealous Advocates, are a&s;hamed to plead a Cau&s;e, which all Men, but our&s;elves, condemn.

We may ring eternal Changes, upon Taxation, and Repre&s;entation, upon actual, vir|tual, and Non-repre&s;entation. We may end as we began, and di&s;agree eternally; but there is one Propo&s;ition, a &s;elf evident Propo&s;ition, to which all the World give their A&s;&s;ent, and from which we cannot withold ours; that whatever Taxation, and Repre&s;entation may be, Taxa|tion, and Government, are in&s;eparable. On the Subject of Taxation, the Authority of Mr. Lock, is generally quoted by our Advocates, as paramount to all other Authority whatever. His Treati&s;e on Government, as far as his Ideas are practicable, with the corrupt Materials of all Governments, is undoubtedly, a mo&s;t beauti|ful Theory, the noble&s;t A&s;&s;ertion of the unali|enable Rights of Mankind. Let us re&s;pect it as the Opinions of a wi&s;e, and virtuous Philo&s;o|pher, and Patriot, but let us likewi&s;e, as good Subjects, revere the Laws of the Land, the collected Wi&s;dom of Ages, and make them the &s;ole Rule of our political Conduct. Let not Mr. Lock be quoted partially, by tho&s;e who have read him, to mi&s;lead Thou&s;ands who never read him. When he is brought as an Authority, that no Subject can be ju&s;tly taxed without his own Con&s;ent; why don't they add his own Explanation of that Con&s;ent? <Q>i.e. The Con|&s;ent of the Majority, giving it either by them|&s;elves, or their Repre&s;entatives cho&s;en by them.</Q>

Do we compo&s;e the Majority of the Briti&s;h Community? Are we, or are we not of that Community? If we are of that Community, but are not repre&s;ented, are we not in the &s;ame Situation with the numerous Body of Copy|holders, with the Inhabitants of many wealthy and populous Towns; in &s;hort, with a very great Number of our fellow Subjects, who have no Votes in Elections? Shall we affirm that the&s;e are all virtually repre&s;ented, but deny that we are &s;o; and at the &s;ame Time, be too proud to &s;olicit a Repre&s;entation? or under the trite and popular Pretences, of Venality and Corruption, laugh at it as impracticable? Shall we plunge at once into Anarchy, and reject all Accommodation with a Government, (by the Confe&s;&s;ion of the wi&s;e&s;t Men in Europe, the free&s;t and the noble&s;t Government, on the Re|cords of Hi&s;tory) becau&s;e there are Imperfec|tions in it, as there are in all Things, and in all Men? Are we Confederates, or Allies, or Subjects of Great-Britain? In what Code of Laws, are we to &s;earch for Taxation, under the Title, and Condition, of Requi&s;ition, as we under&s;tand the Word?

We boa&s;t much of our bountiful Com|pliance with the Requi&s;itions made during the la&s;t War, and in many In&s;tances with Rea|&s;on; but let us remember and acknowledge, that there was even then, more than one rich Province, that refu&s;ed to comply, altho' the War, was in the very Bowels, of the Country.
