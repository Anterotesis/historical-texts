<HEAD>Lord Chatham's Speech On the following Motion made by his Lord&s;hip, viz.
<Q>"That an humble Addre&s;s be pre&s;ented to his Ma|je&s;ty, mo&s;t humbly to advi&s;e and be&s;eech him that, in order to open a Way towards an happy Settle|ment of the dangerous troubles in America by be|ginning to allay ferments, and &s;often animo&s;ities there; and above all, for preventing, in the mean time, any &s;udden and fatal cata&s;trophe at Bo&s;ton, now &s;uffering under the daily irritation of an army before their eyes, and po&s;ted in their town: It may graciou&s;ly plea&s;e his Maje&s;ty, that immediate orders be de&s;patched to General Gage for removing his Maje&s;ty's forces from the town of Bo&s;ton, as &s;oon as the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, and other circum&s;tances indi&s;pen&s;able to the &s;afety and accommodation of the &s;aid troops, may render the &s;ame practicable."</Q></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RISE with va&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee the&s;e pa|papers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The whole of the American papers ju&s;t then delivered in at the table by Lord Dartmouth, at the command of his Maje&s;ty.</NOTE> brought to your table in &s;o late a pe|riod of this bu&s;ine&s;s; papers, I am &s;ure, the contents of which are already known, not only to every noble Lord in this Hou&s;e, but almo&s;t to eve|ry per&s;on in this kingdom, who has made American affairs in the lea&s;t an object of inquiry; yet now, in the very tail of this bu&s;ine&s;s, when mea&s;ures &s;hould be long &s;ince determined on, we are fur|ni&s;hed
<PB N="4" REF="014406_0004_0F92650E8370E3D0">
with an empty parade of parchments&mdash;to tell us what? Why, what all the world knew be|fore &mdash;that the Americans, &s;ore under injuries, and irritated by wrongs, &s;tript of their inborn Rights and deare&s;t Privileges, have re&s;i&s;ted, and entered into a&s;&s;ociations for the pre&s;ervation of <HI>that ble&s;&s;ing</HI> to which life and property are but &s;econdary con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Give me leave to a&s;k you, my Lords, how the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations have been formed? Has the tide of corruption yet flowed in upon their elections? Have tho&s;e delegates been &s;uborned? Or have great intere&s;t, great power, or great threats been u&s;ed (as is too much the ca&s;e in this our boa&s;ted mother country) to crayon out what conduct they &s;hould adopt? No&mdash;nothing like this has appear|ed; the electors &s;eem to be prompted by no other motive than that glorious, and exalted one, <HI>the pre|&s;ervation of their common Liberties</HI>; and under this idea they have been induced to appoint men competent to &s;o great an undertaking; men of tried and &s;ound principles, embarked in the &s;ame great cau&s;e, and, from &s;imilar &s;entiments, taught to pity the mi&s;eries of the whole.</P>
<P>Inve&s;ted then with this right (the choice of a free people) the&s;e delegates have deliberated with prudence, wi&s;dom, and &s;pirit; and, in con&s;equence of the&s;e deliberations, have addre&s;&s;ed the ju|&s;tice, and honor of this country. This is their fault; this is their crime; petitioning for that, with|out which a free people cannot po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t;&mdash; yet, for a&s;king this boon, this unalienable privilege of Engli&s;hmen, are they reprobated, and &s;tigmatiz|ed with the epithets of ingrates&mdash;traitors&mdash;and rebels.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="014406_0005_0F92650F31EFA160">Had the early &s;ituation of the people of Bo&s;ton been attended to, my Lords, it would not have come to this&mdash;but the infant complaints of Bo&s;ton were literally treated like the capricious &s;qualls of a child, who, it was &s;aid, did not know whether it was aggrieved, or not.&mdash;But full well, my Lords, I knew, at that time, that this child, if not redre&s;|&s;ed, would &s;oon a&s;&s;ume the courage, and voice of a man. The Bo&s;tonians did not then complain upon &s;light, or temporary evil; but on an evil which &s;apped the very vitals of their con&s;titution, and reduced all the great ble&s;&s;ings of life to chance, equivocation, and in&s;ecurity. Full well I knew that the &s;ons of ance&s;tors, born under the &s;ame free con&s;titution, and once breathing the &s;ame liberal air as Engli&s;hmen&mdash;ance&s;tors, who even quitted this land of Liberty, the moment it became the land of Oppre&s;&s;ion, and, in re&s;i&s;tance to bigotted councils, and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, tore them&s;elves from their deare&s;t connexions; I &s;ay, my Lords, full well I knew that the offspring of &s;uch ance&s;|tors would re&s;i&s;t upon the &s;ame principles, and on the &s;ame occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>It has, however, gone abroad, that the re&s;olu|tions, and petitions, of the Congre&s;s are not the re|al re&s;olutions and petitions of the &s;ober, re&s;pectable, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate; but the very dregs and refu&s;e of the people; and to circulate this report the better, letters are handed about from &s;ome very re&s;pec|table merchants (as they are called) from the dif|ferent provinces. But well I know how to de|&s;cribe &s;uch merchants&mdash;little paltry, peddling fel|lows, venders of twopenny wares, and fal&s;hoods, who under the idea of trade, &s;ell every thing in
<PB N="6" REF="014406_0006_0F926512E704B948">
their power&mdash;Honor, Tru&s;t, and Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The&s;e fellows (for &s;uch is the lot of humanity) are ever to be found in all countries&mdash;and are al|ways in great plenty when their country is at &s;take, who, without ever regarding con&s;equences, and that general ruin might en&s;ue, pre&s;s forward to the goal of lucre, and cut out the &s;horte&s;t pa&s;&s;age to their own intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e are the men, who are held out to us to take a true &s;tate of the country from; Men who act, upon the mo&s;t illiberal principles, chil|dren of the world; who have no fixed re&s;idence &mdash;no la&s;ting attachments, but to the &s;hrine of Mammon. But it is not &s;uch that ever &s;peak the voice of a people&mdash;it is the proprietors, and tillers of the ground&mdash;men who have a permanent&mdash;na|tural right in the place&mdash;and who from being nur&s;|ed in the bo&s;om of cultivation, form &s;trong and honorable attachments to their country;&mdash;it is to the&s;e, credit and authority are to be given, and from the&s;e our be&s;t informations are to be drawn.</P>
<P>Much, my Lords, has been &s;aid about the au|thority of Parliament in the&s;e ca&s;es, and when men are driven for want of argument, they fly to this as their la&s;t re&s;ource&mdash;"Acts of Parliament (&s;ay their advocate) are &s;acred, and &s;hould be impli|citly &s;ubmitted to; for if the &s;upreme power does not lodge &s;omewhere operatively and effectually, there mu&s;t be an end of all legi&s;lation." But my Lord, they who argue, or rather dogmatize in this manner, do not &s;ee the whole of this que&s;tion on great, wi&s;e, and liberal grounds; for in all tree &s;tates the con&s;titution is fixed, and all legi&s;lative power and authority, wherever placed, either in
<PB N="7" REF="014406_0007_0F926514F04A07B0">
collective bodies or individually, mu&s;t derive under that con&s;titution who framed them.&mdash;Acts of le|gi&s;lation, therefore, however &s;trong and effective they may be, when they are framed in the &s;pirit of this con&s;titution, yet when they re&s;i&s;t, they attack their own foundation; for it is the con&s;titution, and it alone, that limits both &s;overeignty and alle|giance.</P>
<P>This doctrine, my Lords, is no temporary doc|trine, taken up on particular occa&s;ions to an&s;wer particular purpo&s;es, it is involved in no metaphy&s;i|cal doubts and intricacies&mdash;but clear, preci&s;e, and determined. It is recorded in all our law books, it is written in the great volume of nature&mdash;it is the e&s;&s;ential, unalterable right of Engli&s;hmen&mdash;it ac|cords with all the principles of ju&s;tice and civil po|licy, which neither armed force on the one &s;ide, nor &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the other, can upon any occa&s;ion whatever eradicate.</P>
<P>It was this doctrine that was the great guide and &s;pirit to the framers of the bill of rights, at the peri|od of the glorious revolution&mdash;men of the greate&s;t accuracy, wi&s;dom, and hone&s;ty; and, without any di&s;paragement to the pre&s;ent day, few &s;uch coun|&s;ellors are now to be &s;een. Recollect, my Lords, for a moment, the arguments u&s;ed by the&s;e men&mdash; and &s;ee how wi&s;e, liberal, and con&s;titutional they were; turn then to their opponents, and how flim|&s;y, thin, and unprovided they appear! if then we applaud our ance&s;tors for obtaining &s;uch liberties for us, at a time when all the rights of Engli&s;hmen were trampled upon, and de&s;poti&s;m had trodden down the laws, &s;urely we cannot, in rea&s;on, deny that portion of liberty (&s;o hardly and honorably ob|tained)
<PB N="8" REF="014406_0008_0F92651677F0A9D8">
to our own brethren&mdash;brethren by the &s;ame common parent, and who are unque&s;tionable heirs of the &s;ame glorious inheritance.</P>
<P>The facts being then, my Lords, as I have &s;tated them, what has government done? they have &s;ent an armed force, con&s;i&s;ting of above &s;eventeen thou|&s;and men, to dragoon the Bo&s;tonians into what is called their duty, and for the cha&s;ti&s;ement of a &s;mall rabble, con&s;i&s;ting of the nece&s;&s;itous and cha|racterle&s;s in doing an unlawful act, have involved above thirty thou&s;and inhabitants in the greate&s;t difficulty, oppre&s;&s;ion, and con&s;ternation. Is this the way to win men to their duty, and recover in them the principles of affection and Briti&s;h allegi|ance? Do you think, that men who could be rou&s;|ed to forego their profits, their plea&s;ures, and the peaceable enjoyment of their deare&s;t connections &mdash;all for the &s;ake of liberty, will be whipped into va&s;&s;alage like &s;laves? Why, my Lords, this conduct in government is &s;o fanta&s;tical and aerial in practice, that it by far exceeds the bolde&s;t wing of poetry; for poetry has often read plea&s;ing, as well as in|&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons to mankind; and though it &s;ome|times amu&s;es her&s;elf in fiction, that fiction, to plea&s;e, &s;hould be founded on veri&s;imilitude. But in this wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem there is nothing like truth, nothing like policy, nothing like ju&s;tice, experience, or com|mon &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, government, &s;o far from once turning its eyes to the policy and de&s;tructive con&s;e|quence of this &s;cheme, are con&s;tantly &s;ending out more troops; and we are told, in the language of menace, that if &s;eventeen thou&s;and men wont do, fifty thou&s;and &s;hall. 'Tis true, my Lords, with this
<PB N="9" REF="014406_0009_0F926516B3DFE458">
force they may ravage the country; wa&s;te and de&s;troy as they march; but in the progre&s;s of &s;e|venteen hundred miles, can they occupy the pla|ces they have pa&s;&s;ed? Will not a country, which can produce three millions of people, wronged and in&s;ulted as they are, &s;tart up like Hydras in every corner, and gather fre&s;h &s;trength from fre&s;h oppo|&s;ition? Nay, what dependance can you have upon the &s;oldiery, the unhappy engines of your wrath? They are Engli&s;hmen; who mu&s;t feel for the pri|vileges of Engli&s;hmen; and their carrying mu&s;kets and bayonets about them, &s;urely does not exclude them the pale of civil community. Do you think that the&s;e men, then, can turn their arms again&s;t their brethren?&mdash;Surely no&mdash;a victory mu&s;t be to them a defeat&mdash;carnage&mdash;a &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, it is not merely three millions of people, the produce of America, we have to combat with, in this unnatural &s;truggle; many more are on their &s;ide, di&s;per&s;ed over the face of this wide em|pire. Every Whig in this country is for them. Ireland is with them to a man; nay, even tho&s;e Engli&s;hmen, who may be now temporarily inac|tive, when they once come to be rouzed to a &s;en&s;e of recollection; when they come to weigh the great line of right, which their brethren in A|merica are contending for, the &s;en&s;e of their own danger will in&s;truct them to range them&s;elves on their &s;ide.</P>
<P>Who then, in the name of Heaven! could advi&s;e this mea&s;ure? or who can continue to give this &s;trange and uncon&s;titutional advice? I do not mean to level at one man, or any particular &s;et of men; but thus much I will declare, that if his M&mdash;con|tinues
<PB N="10" REF="014406_0010_0F92651774A1E850">
to hear &s;uch coun&s;ellors, he will not only be badly advi&s;ed, but undone. He may wear his C&mdash;n indeed, it is true, but it will not be worth his wearing: Robbed of &s;o principal a jewel as Ame|rica, it will lo&s;e its lu&s;tre, and no longer beam that effulgence which &s;hould irradiate the brow of M&mdash;y. What then is become of this boa&s;ted coun|try of England, once &s;o renowned in arts, as well as arms? What is become of her con&s;titution, that has hitherto been the wonder as well as the envy of &s;urrounding nations! has &s;he changed her civil power, and &s;alutary laws for a military code? Or has &s;he transferred her &s;eat of empire to Con&s;tanti|nople?&mdash;Has &s;he, who has often &s;hed her deare&s;t blood in the manly re&s;i&s;tance of de&s;poti&s;m, now not only tamely &s;ubmitted to it, but &s;at down her&s;elf to forge the arbitrary chains?</P>
<P>But our pre&s;ent governors, alas! think &s;o little of this matter, that I hear General Gage has been thought to have acted too tardy in this bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash; that he has not been &s;wift enough to execute ven|geance, and &s;heath the &s;word in the bowels of his countrymen. I really pity the unfortunate &s;itua|tion of that gentleman, who has approved him&s;elf on many occa&s;ions a gallant &s;oldier, and humane man; for what, from being under the di&s;agreea|ble predicament of doing his duty on the one &s;ide, and his own feelings of ju&s;tice and policy on the other, what a conflict mu&s;t he have! his &s;ituation, my Lords, puts me in mind of a &s;imilar tran&s;action in the civil wars of France, when the great Conde on one &s;ide, and Mar&s;hal Turenne on the other, commanded different armies; the latter con&s;cious what terrible con&s;equences a victory mu&s;t produce
<PB N="11" REF="014406_0011_0F926518470B8B08">
to him&s;elf and country, though often in his power, avoided blows as much as po&s;&s;ible. After the affair was over, the Mar&s;hal was thus reprimanded at court for not at lea&s;t taking the Prince; <HI>pourquoi ne l'avez vous pas pris?</HI> but that great General ve|ry &s;en&s;ibly replied, <HI>parceque, Sire, &s;i je l'avois fait tout Paris en revanche m'auroit pris.</HI> "Should I take him, plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, I was afraid all Pa|ris would take me."</P>
<P>In this alarming cri&s;is, this di&s;tracted view of af|fairs, I come, my Lords, with this paper in my hand (holding out his motion) to offer you the be&s;t of my experience and advice, which is "to be&s;eech his Ma|je&s;ty that he would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give im|mediate orders to Gen. Gage to withdraw his troops from before the town of Bo&s;ton, in order to open the way for a plan of concord and reconciliation;" and this, my Lords, upon the mo&s;t mature and deliberate grounds, is the be&s;t advice I can give you at this junc|ture. Such a conduct will convince America that you mean to try her cau&s;e in the &s;pirit ot freedom &amp; inqui|ry, and not in letters of blood; it will be a pledge to her that you mean nothing more than friend&s;hip and equity, and &s;he, I tru&s;t, will meet you half way. But how can &s;he tru&s;t you with the bayonet at her brea&s;t? Nay, how does &s;he know, but after having &s;ubmitted to the &s;word, you mean to forge for her heavier chains, the general con&s;equence of ferocious victory.</P>
<P>I have crawled, my Lords, to this hou&s;e to day, to tell you &s;o&mdash;I think it my duty to give the whole of my experience, &amp; council to my country at all times, but more particularly, when &s;he is in &s;o much need of it; and having thus entered on the thre&s;hold of this bu&s;ine&s;s, I will knock at your gates of ju&s;tice, and never &s;top, ex|cept infirmities &s;hall nail me to my bed, until I
<PB N="12" REF="014406_0012_0F926518EAA7F7B8">
have, at lea&s;t, tried every thing in my power to heal tho&s;e unhappy divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is no time to be lo&s;t&mdash;every hour is big with danger&mdash;perhaps even whil&s;t I am now &s;peaking, the deci&s;ive blow is &s;truck, which may involve millions in the con&s;equence; and believe me, the very fir&s;t drop of blood that is &s;pilled, will not be a wound ea&s;ily &s;kinned over&mdash;it will be <HI>ir|ritabile v<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">lnus</HI>; a wound of that rancorous and fe&s;tering kind, that, in all probability, will mortify the whole body.</P>
<P>Let us then, my Lords, in&s;tantly begin with this bu&s;ine&s;s, but let us not act, as hitherto has been acted&mdash;taking it up by bits and &s;crapes, as exigen|cies pre&s;&s;ed, without any regard to general rela|tions, and dependencies. What &s;ignifies merely repealing this, or that particular act? This is but meanly &s;neaking out of one difficulty perhaps to get into a wor&s;e, and can never an&s;wer the purpo|&s;es of a wi&s;e, amicable, and con&s;titutional &s;y&s;tem. The more annihilation of a few, little, dirty &s;hreds of parchment&mdash;can never produce any la&s;ting ef|fect on the happine&s;s, and commerce of three mil|lions of people, hitherto ground down with mi&s;e|ries and wrongs, and in hourly dread of having them occa&s;ionally rehear&s;ed.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t look on this great bu&s;ine&s;s in one large connected view, work on it, &s;tep by &s;tep, with cau|tion, and liberality, and never lo&s;e &s;ight of it until it is accompli&s;hed;&mdash;this is the way, not only to obtain confidence for the pre&s;ent, but &s;olid and la&s;ting happine&s;s for the future: The line thus drawn, the Americans will have &s;omething to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to&mdash;and we &s;hall be taught not to tran&s;gre&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="014406_0013_0F926519C80F1858">
that line.&mdash;Thus mutual confidence will be be|gun, and mutual benefit mu&s;t follow. I know that it has been in circulation, that if the <HI>&s;tamp act</HI> had never been repealed, we &s;hould be at this hour in peace and quietne&s;s with America; and from this many people urge the danger, as well as inef|ficacy of conciliating mea&s;ures at pre&s;ent. But though I could readily confute the fal&s;hood, and ab&s;urdity of this a&s;&s;ertion, by appealing to the very official letters from your American Govenors at that period&mdash;I &s;hall wave this ground, and only mention to your Lord&s;hips a circum&s;tance, which will &s;et this matter in a full clearer light, and &s;how you the temper, firmne&s;s, and complexion of the Bo&s;tonians on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sometime after the repeal of that act, I happen|ed to be in company (at the hou&s;e of a mutual friend above 100 miles from this town) with one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and intelligent merchants in this country; in a conver&s;ation I had with him upon this &s;ubject, I begged him to be as explicit as po&s;&s;ible in giving me his opinion on the repeal. This gentleman then told me, and confirmed his account by &s;everal written and re&s;pectable eviden|ces, that the people of Bo&s;ton, previous to the re|peal, waited in fullen &s;ilence the deliberations of the Briti&s;h parliament, and were p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">vely deter|mined, if that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> victory had not been obtained, immediately to abandon the town, their re&s;idence, and all the benefits of commerce; to the country they were determined to retire with their families and friends, more happy to be <HI>freemen</HI> though til|lers of the earth, than <HI>&s;laves</HI> under the greate&s;t pro&s;perity. Does this re&s;olution look like tamely
<PB N="14" REF="014406_0014_0F92651A6BDF00B8">
&s;ubmitting to indignities? Or does it &s;hew that it is owing to this <HI>ju&s;t relaxation</HI> of government, that they have been taught to act with that firmne&s;s, and per&s;everance, they have &s;ince that period pur|&s;ued?</P>
<P>I would not, however, wi&s;h, my Lords, by this to encourage America to proceed beyond the line of right&mdash;I reprobate as much as any of you tho&s;e acts of violence which a few of her mobility have committed; but when her inherent, con&s;titu|tional rights are invaded, tho&s;e rights &s;he has an equitable claim to the full enjoyment of, by the fundamental laws of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and ingrafted on that con&s;titution by the unalterable laws of nature; then I own my&s;elf an American; and feeling my&s;elf as &s;uch, &s;hall, to the verge of my life, vindicate her Rights. If America, howe|ver, &s;hould, at any time lo&s;e &s;ight of this Line, I &s;hall be an Engli&s;hman, and defend tho&s;e Rights again&s;t any power, under Heaven, that would op|po&s;e them.&mdash;</P>
