<HEAD>THE True INTEREST OF GREAT-BRITAIN SET FORTH In REGARD TO THE COLONIES; And the only MEANS of Living in Peace and Harmony with them: Including, FIVE different PLANS For Effecting this Salutary Mea&s;ure.</HEAD>
<P>A VERY &s;trange notion is now indu&s;|triou&s;ly &s;preading, that 'till the late un|happy Stamp-Act, there were no bicker|ings and di&s;contents, no heart-burnings and jea|lou&s;ies &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the Colonies and the Mother-Country. It &s;eems, 'till that fatal pe|riod, all was harmony, peace and love. Now it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible even for the mo&s;t &s;uperfi|cial ob&s;erver, if his knowledge extends beyond the limits of a New&s;paper, not to know, "that this is entirely fal&s;e." And if he is at all con|ver&s;ant in the hi&s;tory of the Colonies, and has attended to the accounts of their origi|nal Plantation, their ri&s;e and progre&s;s, he
<PB N="4" REF="015119_0003_0F95D0DEE84A4CF0">
mu&s;t know, that almo&s;t from the very be|ginning, there were mutual di&s;contents, mutual animo&s;ities and reproaches. Indeed, while the&s;e Colonies were in a mere &s;tate of infancy, dependent on their Mother-Country not only for daily protection, but almo&s;t for daily bread, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that they would give them&s;elves the &s;ame airs of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and independence, as they did afterwards, in pro|portion as they grew up to a &s;tate of maturity. But that they began very early to &s;hew no other marks of attachment to their ancient parent, than what aro&s;e from views of &s;elf-intere&s;t and &s;elf-love, many convincing proofs might be drawn from the complaints of, and the in&s;truc|tions to the Governors of the re&s;pective Pro|vinces; from the memorials of our Boards of Trade, pre&s;ented from time to time to his Ma|je&s;ty's Privy Council again&s;t the behaviour of the Coloni&s;ts; from the frequent petitions and remon&s;trances of our Merchants and Manu|facturers to the &s;ame effect; and even from the votes and re&s;olutions of &s;everal of their Pro|vincial A&s;&s;emblies again&s;t the intere&s;t, laws, and Government of the Mother-Country; yet I will wave all the&s;e at pre&s;ent, and content my|&s;elf with proofs &s;till more authentic and unex|ceptionable; I mean the public Statutes of the Realm: For from them it evidently appears, that long before there were any thoughts of the Stamp-Act, the Mother-Country had the following accu&s;ations to bring again&s;t the Co|lonies, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 1&s;t, that they refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to
<PB N="5" REF="015119_0004_0F95D0DF707B0A90">
her ordinances and regulations in regard to Trade.&mdash;2dly, that they attempted to frame Laws, and to erect Juri&s;diction not only inde|pendently of her, but even in direct oppo&s;ition to her authority.&mdash;And 3dly, that many of them took unlawful methods to &s;kreen them&s;elves from paying the ju&s;t debts they owed to the Merchants and Manufacturers of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the objections of the Mother-Country to the behaviour of the colonies long before their la&s;t outrages, and their pre&s;ent con|duct:&mdash;For even as early as the year 1670, it doth appear, that MANY COMPLAINTS (the very words of the Act) had been made again&s;t the AMERICAN Proprietors of Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, for engaging in Schemes of Traffic, contrary to the regulations contained in the act of Naviga|gation, and in other &s;tatutes of the Realm made for confining the trade of the Colonies to the Mother-Country. Nay, &s;o &s;en&s;ible was the Parliament above an hundred Years ago, that Pro&s;ecutions for the breach of tho&s;e laws would be to little or no effect, if carried on in AME|RICAN Courts, or before AMERICAN Juries, that it is expre&s;&s;ly ordained, <Q>It &s;hall, it may be law|ful for any per&s;on or per&s;ons to pro&s;ecute &s;uch Ship or Ve&s;&s;el [offending as de&s;cribed in the preceding Section] in any Court of Ad|miralty in England; the one moiety of the forfeiture, in ca&s;e of condemnation, to be to his Maje&s;ty, his Heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; and the other Moiety to &s;uch Pro&s;ecutor or Pro&s;ecutors thereof.</Q> See 22 and 23 of Ch.
<PB N="6" REF="015119_0005_0F95D0E02ECB6E60">
II. Cap. 26. &sect; 12 and 13.] And we find, that two years afterwards, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 25 of Ch. II. Cap. 7, the &s;ame complaints were again renewed; and in con&s;equence thereof higher duties and ad|ditional penalties were laid on, for the more ef|fectually enforcing of the ob&s;ervance of this and of the former laws: But in &s;pite of all that was done, things grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day. For it is ob&s;ervable, that in the year 1696, the very authority of the Engli&s;h Legi&s;lature, for making &s;uch laws and regula|tions, &s;eemed to have been called in que&s;tion; which authority, therefore, the Parliament was obliged to a&s;&s;ert in terms very peremptory;&mdash;and I may likewi&s;e add, very prophetical. The Law made on this occa&s;ion was the famous Statute of the 7th and 8th of William III. Cap. 7 wherein, after the recital of divers acts <Q>made for the encouragement of the Naviga|tion of this Kingdom, and for the better &s;e|curing and regulating the Plantation Trade, it is remarked, that notwith&s;tanding &s;uch laws, great abu&s;es are daily committed, to the pre|judice of the Engli&s;h Navigation, and the Lo&s;s of great part of the Plantation trade to this Kingdom, by the artifice and cunning of ill-dispo&s;ed Per&s;ons.</Q> Then, having pre|&s;cribed &s;uch remedies as the&s;e great evils &s;eemed to require, the Act goes on at &sect;. 7. to ordain, <Q>That all the penalties and Forfeitures before mentioned, not in this act particu|larly di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;hall be one third part to the u&s;e of his Maje&s;ty, his Heirs, and Suc|ce&s;&s;ors,
<PB N="7" REF="015119_0006_0F95D0E0ED2A7830">
and one third part to the Governor of the Colony of Plantation where the offence &s;hall be committed, and the other third part to &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons as &s;hall &s;ue for the &s;ame, to be recovered in any of his maje&s;ty's courts at We&s;tmin&s;ter, or in the kingdom of Ireland, or in the courts of Admiralty held in his maje&s;ty's Plantations re&s;pectively, where &s;uch offence &s;hall be committed, "at the plea|&s;ure of the Officer or Informer, or in any other Plantation belonging to any &s;ubject of England wherein no E&s;&s;oin, protection, or wager of Law &s;hall be allowed; and that where any que&s;tion &s;hall ari&s;e concerning the importa|tion or exportation of any goods into or out of the &s;aid plantations, in &s;uch ca&s;e the proof &s;hall lie upon the owner or claimer; and the claimer &s;hall be reputed to be the importer or owner thereof.</Q></P>
<P>Now here it is obvious to every reader, that the &s;u&s;picions which the Parliament had for|merly conceived of the partiality of American Courts, and American Juries in trials at Law with the Mother-Country, were &s;o far from being abated by length of time, that they were grown higher than ever; becau&s;e it ap|pears by this very act, that the power of the Officer or Informer was greatly enlarged, hav|ing the option now granted him of three dif|ferent Countries for pro&s;ecuting the offence; whereas in the former of Charles II. made 16 years before, he had only two. Moreover it was this time further ordained, that the Onus
<PB N="8" REF="015119_0007_0F95D0E1B0C84BE8">
probandi &s;hould re&s;t on the defendant, and al&s;o that no<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An E&s;&s;oin &s;ignifies, in Law, a pretence or excu&s;e.</NOTE> E&s;&s;oin, Protection. or<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Wager at Law, is a power granted to the Defendant to &s;wear, together with other COMPURGATORS, that he owes no|thing to the Plaintiff in the manner &s;et forth.&mdash;It is ea&s;y to &s;ee what u&s;e would have been made of &s;uch a power had it been allowed.</NOTE> Wager of law &s;hould be allowed him.</P>
<P>But above all, and in order to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible every &s;ort of chicane for the future, and to fru&s;trate all attempts of the Colonies, either to throw off or evade the power and ju|ri&s;diction of the Mother-Country,&mdash;It was at &sect; 9. <Q>further enacted and declared by the au|thority afore&s;aid, that all Laws, Bye-Laws, U&s;ages, or Cu&s;toms, at this time, or which hereafter &s;hall be in practice, or endeavoured, or pretended to be in force or practice, in any of the &s;aid Plantations, which are in any wi&s;e repugnant to the before mentioned Laws, or any of them, &s;o far as they do relate to the &s;aid Plantations, or any of them, or which are any ways repugnant to this pre&s;ent Act, or to any other law hereafter to be made in this KINGDOM, &s;o far as &s;uch Law &s;hall re|late to, and mention the &s;aid Plantations, are ILLEGAL, Null, and Void to all INTENTS and PURPOSES What&s;oever.</Q></P>
<P>Words could be hardly devi&s;ed to expre&s;s the &s;entiments of the Engli&s;h Legi&s;lature, more fully and &s;trongly, than the&s;e have done: And if ever a body of unin&s;pired Men were endowed
<PB N="9" REF="015119_0008_0F95D0E272071160">
with a &s;pirit of Divination, or of fore&s;eeing, and al&s;o of providing again&s;t untoward future events, as far as human prudence could extend, the King, Lords, and Commons of the AEra 1696, were the very Men. For they evidently fore|&s;aw, that a time was approaching, when the Provincial a&s;&s;emblies would di&s;pute the Right of AMERICAN Sovereignty with the great and general Council of the BRITISH Empire: And therefore they took effectual care that, whenever the time came, no law, no precedent, nor pre|&s;cription, &s;hould be wanting, whereby the Mother-Country might a&s;&s;ert her con&s;titutional and inherent right over the Colonies.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e wi&s;e Precautions, &s;ome of the Colonies found ways and means to evade the Force and meaning even of this ex|pre&s;s law; at lea&s;t for a time, and 'till the Legi&s;lature could be &s;ufficiently apprized of the injury de&s;igned. The Coloni&s;ts, who practi&s;ed the&s;e di&s;ingenuous arts with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, were tho&s;e who were endowed with chartered Govern|ments, and who in con&s;equence of the extra|ordinary favours thereby indulged them, could nominate or elect their own Council, and (if my memory doth not fail me) their own Go|vernors likewi&s;e;&mdash;at lea&s;t, who could grant &s;uch &s;alaries to their Governors, and with &s;uch limitations, as would render them too depen|dent on the will and plea&s;ure of their Pay-Ma&s;ters. Hence therefore it came to pa&s;s, that in the Colonies of Rhode-I&s;land and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay,
<PB N="10" REF="015119_0009_0F95D0E32F7F4570">
and New Hamp&s;hire; the Governors of the&s;e Provinces &s;uffered them&s;elves to be per&s;uaded to give their &s;anction to certain Votes and Re&s;olu|lutions of their A&s;&s;emblies and Councils; where|by laws were enacted fir&s;t to i&s;&s;ue out bills of Credit to a certain amount, and then to make a tender of tho&s;e bills to be con&s;idered as an adequate di&s;charge of debts, and a legal re|lea&s;e from payment. A mo&s;t compendious me|thod this for getting out of debt! And were the like artifice to be authorized every where, I think it is very evident, that none but the mo&s;t &s;tupid Ideot would be incapable of di&s;|charging his debts, bonds, or obligations; and that too without advancing any money.</P>
<P>However, as &s;oon as the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature came to be fully appri&s;ed of this &s;cheme of ini|quity, they pa&s;&s;ed a Law, <Q>to regulate and re&s;train paper Bills of Credit in his Maje&s;ty's Colonies or Plantations, of Rhode I&s;land and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ets Bay, and New Hamp&s;hire in Ame|rica; and to prevent the &s;ame being le|gal tenders in payments of money.</Q>&mdash;This is the very title of the Statute; but for further particulars, and for the different regu|lations therein contained, con&s;ult the act it&s;elf, 24th of George II. Cap. 53, Anno 1751.</P>
<P>Now will any Man after this dare to &s;ay, that the Stamp-Act was the fir&s;t cau&s;e of di&s;&s;ention between the Mother-Country and her Colonies? Will any Man &s;till per&s;i&s;t in maintaining &s;o gro&s;s a Paradox, that 'till that fatal period, the Co|lonies
<PB N="11" REF="015119_0010_0F95D1B9AED3E270">
&s;hewed no reluctance to &s;ubmit to the commercial regulations, no di&s;po&s;ition to con|te&s;t the authority, and no de&s;ire to que&s;tion the right of the Mother-Country? The man who can maintain the&s;e paradoxes, is incapable of conviction, and therefore is not to be rea|&s;oned with any longer. <Q>But the Stamp-Act made bad to become wor&s;e:&mdash;The Stamp-Act irritated and inflamed, and greatly en|crea&s;ed all tho&s;e ill humours, which were but too predominant before.</Q> Granted; and I will further add, that any other act, or any other mea&s;ure, of the Briti&s;h Government, as well as the Stamp-Act, if it were to compel the Coloni&s;ts to contribute a &s;ingle &s;hilling to|wards the general expence of the Briti&s;h Em|pire, would have had the &s;ame effect. For, be it ever remembered, that the Coloni&s;ts did not &s;o much object to the mode of this tax|ation, as to the right it&s;elf of levying taxes. Nay, their friends and agents here in England were known to have frequently declared, that if any tax were to be crammed down their throats without their con&s;ent, and by an au|thority which they di&s;allowed, they had rather pay this Stamp-Duty than another.</P>
<P>BUT indeed, and properly &s;peaking, it was not the Stamp-Act which increa&s;ed or height|ened the&s;e ill humours in the Coloni&s;ts; rather, it was the reduction of Canada, which called forth tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions into action which had long been generating before; and which were ready
<PB N="12" REF="015119_0011_0F95D1BA6F3A2A08">
to bur&s;t forth at the fir&s;t opportunity that &s;hould offer. For an undoubted fact it is, that from the moment in which Canada came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, an end was put to the Sovereignty of the Mother-Country over her Colonies. They had then nothing to fear from a foreign enemy; and as to their own do|me&s;tic friends and relations, they had for &s;o many years preceding been accu&s;tomed to tre&s;|pa&s;s upon their forbearance and indulgence, even when they mo&s;t wanted their protection, that it was no wonder they &s;hould openly re|nounce an authority which they never thorougly approved of, and which now they found to be no longer nece&s;&s;ary for their own defence.</P>
<P>BUT here &s;ome may be apt to a&s;k, <Q>Had the Colonies no provocation on their part? And was all the fault on one &s;ide, and none on the other?</Q> Probably not:&mdash;probably there were faults on both &s;ides. But what doth this &s;erve to prove? If to exculpate the Colonies in regard to their pre&s;ent refractory behaviour, it is needle&s;s. For I am far from charging our Colonies in particular with being &s;inners above others; becau&s;e I believe (and If I am wrong, let the hi&s;tory of all Colonies, whether ancient or modern, from the days of THUCYDIDES down to the pre&s;ent time, confute me if it can; I &s;ay, till that is done I believe) that it is the nature of them all to a&s;pire after Independence, and to &s;et up for them&s;elves as &s;oon as ever they find that they are able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without being beholden to the Mother-Country. And if our
<PB N="13" REF="015119_0012_0F95D1BB2C649020">
Americans have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves &s;ooner on this head than others have done, or in a more direct and daring manner, this ought not to be imputed to any greater malignity, or ingrati|tude in them, than in others, but to that bold free con&s;titution, which is the prerogative and boa&s;t of us all. We our&s;elves derive our ori|gin from tho&s;e very SAXONS; who inhabited the lower parts of Germany; and yet I think it is &s;ufficiently evident, that we are not over com|plai&s;ant to the de&s;cendants of the&s;e lower SAXONS, i. e. to the offspring of our own Progenitors; nor can we, with any colour of rea&s;on, pretend to complain that even the Bo&s;tonians have treated us more indignantly than we have treated the Hanoverians. What then would have been the ca&s;e, if the little in&s;ignificant Electorate of Hanover had pre&s;umed to retain a claim of So|vereignty over &s;uch a Country as Great-Britain, the pride and Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Ocean? And yet, I believe, that in point of extent of Territory, the pre&s;ent Electoral Dominions, in&s;ignificant as they are &s;ometimes repre&s;ented, are more than a moiety of England, exclu&s;ive of Scotland and Wales: whereas the whole I&s;land of Great Britain, is &s;carcely a twentieth part of tho&s;e va&s;t Regions which go under the denomination of North-America.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if the American Colonies belonging to France or Spain, have not yet &s;et up for In|dependence, or thrown off the ma&s;que &s;o much as the Engli&s;h Colonies have done,&mdash;what is this
<PB N="14" REF="015119_0013_0F95D1BBEBDDBC80">
&s;uperior re&s;erve to be imputed to? Not to any greater filial tenderne&s;s in them for their re&s;pective antient Parents than in others;&mdash;not to motives of any national gratitude, or of na|tional honour;&mdash;but becau&s;e the con&s;titution of each of tho&s;e Parent States is much more arbitrary and de&s;potic than the con&s;titution of Great-Britain; and therefore their re&s;pective off&s;prings are<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But notwith&s;tanding this awe, it is now pretty generally known, that the French Coloni&s;ts of Hi&s;paniola endeavoured lately to &s;hake off the Government of Old France, and applied to the Briti&s;h Court for that purpo&s;e.</NOTE> awed by the dread of puni&s;h|ments from breaking forth into tho&s;e outrages which ours dare do with impunity. Nay more, the very Colonies of France and Spain, though they have not yet thrown off their allegiance, are neverthele&s;s as forward as any in di&s;obeying the Laws of their Mother-Countries, wherever they find an intere&s;t in &s;o doing. For the truth of this fact, I appeal to that prodigious clan|de&s;tine Trade which they are continually carry|ing on with us, and with our Colonies, contrary to the expre&s;s prohibitions of France and Spain: And I appeal al&s;o to tho&s;e very free ports which the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature it&s;elf hath lately opened for accommodating the&s;e &s;muggling coloni&s;ts to trade with the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, in Di&s;|obedience to the injunction of their Mother-Countries.</P>
<P>Enough &s;urely has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject; and the up&s;hot of the whole matter is plainly
<PB N="15" REF="015119_0014_0F95D1BDA2328828">
this,&mdash;That even the arbitrary and de&s;potic Governments of France and Spain (arbitrary I &s;ay, both in temporals and in &s;pirituals) main|tain their authority over their American Colonies but very imperfectly; in as much as they can|not re&s;train them from breaking through tho&s;e rules and regulations of exclu&s;ive trade; for the &s;ake of which all Colonies &s;eemed to have been originally founded. What then &s;hall we &s;ay in regard to &s;uch Colonies as are the off|&s;pring of a free con&s;titution? And after what manner, or according to what rule, are our own in particular to be governed, without u&s;ing any force or compul&s;ion, or pur&s;uing any mea|&s;ure repugnant to their own ideas of civil or religious Liberty? In &s;hort, and to &s;um up all, in one word, how &s;hall we be able to ren|der the&s;e Colonies more &s;ub&s;ervient to the in|tere&s;ts, and more obedient to the laws and go|vernment of the Mother-Country, than they voluntarily chu&s;e to be?

<P>And 1&s;t, as to that which recommends the &s;uffering all things to go on as they have lately done, in hopes that &s;ome favourable op|portunity may ari&s;e hereafter for recovering the juri&s;diction, and vindicating the honour of the Mother-Country.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t propo&s;al is very unhappy at fir&s;t &s;etting out; becau&s;e it takes that for granted, which hi&s;tory and experience prove to be fal&s;e.

For if a father is not able to govern his &s;on at the ages of 14 or 16 years, how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he will be better able when the youth is become a man of full age and &s;tature, in the vigour of health and &s;trength, and the parent perhaps more feeble and decrepid than he was before? Be&s;ides, it is a fact, that the Colonies, from almo&s;t one end of North-America to the other, have already re|volted from under the juri&s;diction of the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature;&mdash;each Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly hath already arrogated to them&s;elves a new name, by &s;tilling them&s;elves an HOUSE OF COMMONS; in con&s;equence of which &s;tile and title, they have
<PB N="18" REF="015119_0017_0F95D1BFACD93F38">
already declared, that the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Com|mons neither hath, nor ought to have, any right to intermeddle in their concerns. Now, after they have advanced thus far already, what Rhetoric would you u&s;e for calling the&s;e re|volters back? And is it at all probable, that the Provincial A&s;&s;emblies would be induced by the force of oratory to renounce their own impor|tance, and to acknowledge that to be a crime, which both they, and the people whom they re|pre&s;ent, glory as in their birth-right and unali|enable prerogative? The man who can &s;up|po&s;e the&s;e things, mu&s;t have a mo&s;t extraordi|nary opinion of his own eloquence.</P>
<P>BUT here perhaps &s;ome may be inclined to a&s;k, Why would you meddle with the Colonies at all? And why not &s;uffer things to remain in &s;tatu quo? The obvious an&s;wer to which que&s;tions is this,&mdash;That it is not the Mother Country which meddles with the Colonies, but the Colonies which meddle with the Mo|ther-Country: For they will not permit her to govern in the manner &s;he ought to do, and according to the original terms of the con&s;titu|tion; but are making encroachments on her authority every day. Moreover as they in|crea&s;e in riches, &s;trength, and numbers, their civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hments mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily increa&s;e likewi&s;e; and &s;eeing that this circum&s;tance is unavoidable, who is to defray the growing expences of the&s;e increa&s;ing and thriving Colonies? <Q>The Colonies them&s;elves you will naturally &s;ay, becau&s;e none are &s;o fit,
<PB N="19" REF="015119_0018_0F95D1C0714196B0">
and none &s;o able:</Q> And perhaps &s;ome Ame|rican advocates will likewi&s;e add, <Q>That the Colonies do not refu&s;e to defray the&s;e ex|pences, provided they &s;hall be the &s;ole judges of the quantum to be rai&s;ed, or the mode of rai&s;ing it, and of the manner of its ap|plication.</Q> But here lies the difficulty, which remains yet to be &s;olved: For if the Co|lonies are to be allowed to be the &s;ole judges in the&s;e matters, the &s;overeignty of the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature is entirely at an end; and the&s;e Co|lonies become in fact, as much independent of their Mother-Country, as we are independent of Hanover, or Hanover of us;&mdash;only indeed with this difference (which an American always chu&s;es to forget) That whereas we lay a duty on all raw materials coming from the Electoral Do|minions, we give a bounty on tho&s;e which are imported from the Colonies. Be&s;ides, many will be apt to a&s;k, could not this matter be compromi&s;ed in &s;ome degree? And will nothing le&s;s content the Colonies than a total revolt from under the juri&s;diction of the Mother-Country?&mdash;Some well-meaning per&s;ons have propo&s;ed, that each Colony, like each County here in England, &s;hould be allowed to rai&s;e taxes for its own internal u&s;es, whil&s;t the Briti&s;h parliament, the &s;overeign council of the Briti&s;h Empire, &s;hould pre&s;ide over the whole; and therefore &s;hould enact &s;uch laws for the levying of tho&s;e general taxes, which are to be applied for the common protection, the good, and benefit
<PB N="20" REF="015119_0019_0F95D1C12FBC5640">
of all. But the misfortune is, that the Colonies will not con&s;ent to this partition of power and juri&s;diction; con&s;equently any &s;cheme of this nature is utterly impracticable. Indeed the late Stamp-Act it&s;elf was no other than a part of this very &s;cheme: For the money to be rai&s;ed by that tax, was to be applied to the &s;ole u&s;e of the Colonies, and to be expended no where el&s;e but in the Colonies. Nay it was not the moiety, nor yet the third, nor the fourth part of the &s;um which Great-Britain was to have rai&s;ed on the &s;ame account, and to have expended in the &s;ame Provinces:&mdash;So anxious was the antient indulgent parent not to lay too heavy a burden on her favourite children. But alas! Favourites of all kinds &s;eldom make tho&s;e returns of gratitude and obedience, which might be expected. For even as to that boa&s;ted loyalty, which the colonies have hitherto pro|fe&s;&s;ed, to maintain towards his Maje&s;ty King George,&mdash;this &s;tands, and mu&s;t &s;tand, according to their pre&s;ent political &s;y&s;tem, on as precari|ous a footing as any of the re&s;t of our claims. For if the Briti&s;h parliaments have no right to make laws to bind the Colonies, they cer|tainly ought not to be allowed to pre&s;cribe to them "who &s;hall be their King;&mdash;much le&s;s ought they to pretend to a right of enacting, That it &s;hall be a mo&s;t capital offence, even "high trea&s;on" it&s;elf, in a coloni&s;t to dare to controvert the title of any prince, or any family, to the American throne, whom the Briti&s;h Parliament &s;hall place thereon.</P>

BESIDES, &s;ome of tho&s;e lower Hou&s;es of A&s;&s;emblies (which each Province now affects to call its Hou&s;e of Commons) have already pro|ceeded to greater lengths of &s;overeignty and independence than a Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons ever pre&s;umed to do except in the days of the grand rebellion. For they have already arro|gated to them&s;elves a power of di&s;po&s;ing, as well as of rai&s;ing the public monies, without the con&s;ent of the other branches of the legi&s;la|ture; which is, in fact, nothing le&s;s than the erection of &s;o many &s;overeign and independent Democracies. Nay more, there is a general com|bination and confederacy entered into among them all: For each Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly hath lately appointed a &s;tanding committee for cor|re&s;ponding with the &s;tanding committees of other Provinces, in order the more effectually to oppo&s;e the authority and juri&s;diction of the Mother-Country.</P>
<P>WHAT then is to be done in &s;uch a ca&s;e? Evident it is beyond a di&s;pute, that timid and tempori&s;ing mea&s;ures &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e but that of confirming the colonies in their oppo&s;ition, and &s;trengthening them in their pre|&s;ent revolt.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a Pamphlet,&mdash;<Q>Con&s;iderations on the Expediency of admitting Repre&s;entatives from the AMERICAN Colonies into the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons.</Q>&mdash;LONDON, printed "for B. WHITE, 1770.</NOTE>THIS is the &s;cheme of a very worthy gen|tleman, eminently ver&s;ed in the laws and con|&s;titution of Great-Britain, and what is &s;till better, a real, not a pretended Patriot. Let us therefore examine it with as much re&s;pect and deference to his opinion, as the cau&s;e of truth will permit; which I am well per&s;uaded, is full as much as he would require.</P>
<P>HE begins with ob&s;erving very ju&s;tly, page 4. <Q>That the &s;ubjects of the Crown of Great-Britain, mu&s;t (i. e. ought to) continue to be &s;o in every re&s;pect, in all parts of the world, where they live under the protection of the Briti&s;h Government; and that their cro&s;&s;ing the Atlantic Ocean with the King's licence, and re&s;iding in America for the pur|po&s;es of trade, cannot affect their legal &s;ub|jection to the governing powers of the com|munity to which they belong.</Q></P>
<P><Q>BUT yet he ob&s;erves, that the total want of Repre&s;entatives in the great Council of the nation, to &s;upport their intere&s;ts, and give an a&s;&s;ent on their behalf to laws and taxes by which they are bound and affected, is a misfor|tune, which every friend to liberty and equal government mu&s;t be &s;orry to &s;ee them labour under, and from which he mu&s;t wi&s;h them to be relieved in a regular and con&s;titutional

manner, if &s;uch relief can po&s;&s;ibly be af|forded them, without breaking the unity of the Briti&s;h Government.</Q></P>
<P>He therefore proceeds, at page 10, to propo&s;e his &s;cheme for remedying this misfortune; <ABBR>viz</ABBR> <Q>That about eighty per&s;ons might be ad|mitted to &s;it in Parliament, as members of the Commons Hou&s;e of Parliament for all the Kings's Dominions in America, the We&s;t-Indies, as well as North America; and that their Stile and Title &s;hould be "The Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Colonies of AMERICA."</Q> After this he goes on to fix the numbers re|qui&s;ite to repre&s;ent each Colony, their qualifi|cation, and the mode of their election; al&s;o the time of their continuing in office, and the manner of their being re-elected, or &s;uper&s;eded by others, if that &s;hould be judged nece&s;&s;ary: In all which, tho' the propo&s;als are not quite con&s;i&s;tent with the unity of the Briti&s;h Govern|ment, yet as he has obviated the principal dif|ficulties, it would be both ill-natured and un|ju&s;t to &s;py out every &s;mall fault, or to magnify objections.</P>
<P>But when he comes to give us the form, the Extent and the limitation of the&s;e Commi&s;|&s;ions; nay, when he propo&s;es to circum&s;cribe the authority and juri&s;diction of the Briti&s;h Parliament it&s;elf, even after it hath been &s;trengthened by the acce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Colony-Repre&s;entatives; there, I humbly apprehend, the importance of the &s;ubject &s;hould prepon|derate ever more deference and complai&s;ance.

Nay I will go &s;till further, and add, that if the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed &s;hould be &s;hewn to have a tendency to beget endle&s;s jealou&s;ies, quarrels, and divi&s;ions, between the Mother-Country and the Colonies, in&s;tead of proving a means of reconciliation, and a center of union, the Gentleman him&s;elf, I am fully per&s;uaded, would be among the fir&s;t in rejecting his own plan. Let us therefore now de&s;cend into particulars.</P>
<P>And 1&s;t, it is propo&s;ed, page 11, that they (the commi&s;&s;ioners) &s;hould receive a commi&s;|&s;ion in writing from their Electors, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> (the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">QUIRE, Whether it is intended that the Lower Hou&s;es in each A&s;&s;embly &s;hould have the &s;ole Right of voting for the&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners?

<P>Now this Form might pa&s;s very well among our&s;elves at Home, where the majority are not continually on the watch to &s;py out every flaw, real or imaginary: But in regard to the Colo|ni&s;ts,
<PB N="25" REF="015119_0024_0F95D1C4EFB41CC8">
and e&s;pecially an A&s;&s;embly of Coloni&s;ts, the ca&s;e is widely different; For it is well known that their wits are perpetually at work to avail them&s;elves even of the &s;hadow of an Argument to oppo&s;e the Right and Authority of the Mother-country. Therefore they will immedi|ately &s;eize on the words impowering and con|&s;ent, and rea&s;on after the following fallacious manner:&mdash;<Q>The A&s;&s;emblies who elected the Commi&s;&s;ioners, have a Right to in&s;truct them; and the&s;e In&s;tructions, when properly drawn up, are no other than &s;o many tru&s;ts or powers granted to them from Time to time, by the a&s;&s;embly which elected them; which A&s;&s;embly hath therefore a Right to contract or enlarge their Commi&s;&s;ion, as they &s;hall find it to be the Intere&s;t of the Province &s;o to do. Con&s;equently, if the&s;e Commi&s;|&s;ioners &s;hould at any Time Vote contrary to their in&s;tructions, that is, to their commi&s;&s;ion, it follows, that in the&s;e re&s;pects they have exceeded the bounds pre&s;cribed by their Elec|tors. Therefore, being them&s;elves prohibi|ted from voting, and having no authority to vote in &s;uch a Que&s;tion, every Law wherein they gave their &s;uffrage, affecting the Intere&s;ts of the Colonies in general, or any province in particular, is IPSO FACTO Null and Void.</Q> AGAIN.&mdash;<Q>The Colony Commi&s;&s;ioners are to give their con&s;ent in behalf of the Province for which they are cho&s;en, to &s;uch things as &s;hall be ordained in Parliament. This is the Foundation and Corner-Stone of all the Build|ing:
<PB N="26" REF="015119_0025_0F95D1C5AFD8B3F8">
and therefore, if &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners did not give their con&s;ent in behalf of the Provinces for which they were cho&s;en, then it follows, of cour&s;e that no law, affecting the intere&s;ts of &s;uch re&s;pective Provinces, is obligatory, no tax due or payable, nor any regulations made by the pretended authority of the Briti&s;h Parliament without the con|&s;ent of &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners, are to be at all regarded by the American Electors.</Q>&mdash;The&s;e are a few of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed conclu&s;ions, which the Politicians on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic will certainly draw from the terms and expre&s;|&s;ions contained in &s;uch a form. And what is &s;till wor&s;e, both our own hair-brained Repub|licans, and our Mock Patriots at Home will as certainly adopt the &s;ame language, and echo back the &s;ame &s;pecious, tho' fal&s;e allegations, from one end of the Kingdom to the other. Indeed many there are, even among our&s;elves, who with the mo&s;t hone&s;t and upright inten|tions, are at a lo&s;s at pre&s;ent how to di&s;intangle them&s;elves from the&s;e fallacious rea&s;onings. For having unhappily learnt in New&s;paper Di&s;|&s;ertations, and from coffee-hou&s;e harangues, that the Deputies &s;ent to the great Council of the Nation, are the mere Attornies of tho&s;e who elected them;&mdash;the inference is but natural, that the&s;e Attornies ought to do as they are bid; and that in ca&s;e of competition, they ought not to prefer their own private opinions to the judgments of their con&s;tituents.&mdash;I &s;ay, this inference is natural; nay it is nece&s;&s;ary, ju&s;t,
<PB N="27" REF="015119_0026_0F95D1C66BBD6B10">
and true, were the premi&s;es but true from whence it is deduced.</P>
<P>Wherefore, having often had the advan|tage of hearing no le&s;s a per&s;on than the late excellent Judge Fo&s;ter, that true friend to all rea&s;onable liberty, civil and religious,&mdash;I &s;ay, having often heard him di&s;cour&s;ing on the ri&s;e and origin of parliaments, I will venture to lay his &s;tate of the ca&s;e before my reader, hoping that it may remove all his difficulties (if he has any) and work the &s;ame fullne&s;s of conviction in his mind, which it did in mine.</P>
<P><Q>To rea&s;on accurately, &s;aid this upright and able lawyer, on the origin of Parliaments, we mu&s;t trace the matter up to its con&s;tituent principles. Now the fir&s;t idea which &s;trikes one on this occa&s;ion is, that of a large A&s;|&s;embly of different tribes of warriors, either preparing for &s;ome military expedition, or got together, after a victory, to &s;hare the booty and divide the lands among the con|querors. When all are met together in one place, they chu&s;e a Committee for managing their affairs; having found it impracticable to tran&s;act any bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence in any other way. Now this Committee, cho|&s;en by the whole Nation, actually a&s;&s;embled, gives us the fir&s;t rude draught of a National Parliament, or a National Council. But in proce&s;s of time, and when the Nation had made large conque&s;ts, and was cantoned into di&s;tant provinces, it was found to be extremely
<PB N="28" REF="015119_0027_0F95D1C82391F8E8">
inconvenient to a&s;&s;emble the whole Nation to|together into one place. Therefore the next, and indeed the only expedient, was, that each canton or each di&s;trict, which could a&s;&s;emble &s;hould be authori&s;ed to elect a deputy, or deputies, "not for it&s;elf alone, that is the grand mi&s;take" but for the Nation at large which could not a&s;&s;emble; and the powers to be granted to &s;uch deputy or deputies, were ju&s;t the &s;ame as the nation would have grant|ed to them, had it been actually a&s;&s;embled. Hence therefore it comes to pa&s;s, that each deputy repre&s;ents the whole Nation in gene|ral, as much as if he had been elected by the whole Nation; and con&s;equently &s;uch a de|puty is the Attorney, (if he mu&s;t be called by by that name) not of any one particular Tribe, Society or Di&s;trict, but of the whole collectively: So that it becomes the duty of his office to take care of the intere&s;ts of all the people in general, becau&s;e he repre&s;ents them all. In &s;hort, he cannot con&s;i&s;tently with the duty which he owes to the whole pay any deference to the reque&s;t, in&s;truction, remon&s;trance, or memorial, of his particular electors, except in &s;uch ca&s;es only wherein he is convinced in his con&s;cience, that the mea|&s;ures, which they require him to pur&s;ue, are not incompatible with the public good.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far this great Judge of the Briti&s;h con|&s;titution. And tho' many important inferences might be drawn from hence, which would ef|fectually remove tho&s;e difficulties, with which
<PB N="29" REF="015119_0028_0F95D1C8AD30B5D8">

<P>But it is now high time to atttend to another part of this Gentleman's plan for admitting Commi&s;&s;ioners from the Colonies to &s;it and vote in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>And that is, 2dly the extent of their com|mi&s;&s;ion, and indeed the boundary line pre&s;cribed to the Briti&s;h Parliament it&s;elf, whenever it &s;hall interfere in American affairs.

extraordinary ca&s;es, in re&s;pect to the Colonies; In either ca&s;e here &s;eems to be &s;omething intro|duced into the Briti&s;h con&s;titution of a very heterogeneous nature; &s;omething very repug|nant to that unity of government, which the Gentleman him&s;elf allows ought to be preferred to every other con&s;ideration: And I will add further, that if the Colony Commi&s;&s;ioners are to &s;it and vote in all our cau&s;es, tho' our Briti&s;h Repre&s;entatives are re&s;trained from voting in theirs, perhaps ninety-nine times in an hun|dred, this will be the &s;etting up of one of the mo&s;t partial, unequal, and unju&s;t &s;y&s;tems of pacifications, that ever yet appeared in the World.</P>
<P>We therefore proceed to another weighty objection again&s;t the pre&s;ent plan.&mdash;The terms of this new compact are declared to be, that the Colony A&s;&s;emblies &s;hall be inve&s;ted with the right of internal and Provincial juri&s;diction and Legi&s;lation; while the Briti&s;h Parliament, even after the Acce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e 80 Colony Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, &s;hall be content to retain only that which is external and general.&mdash;But here alas! the very &s;ame difficulties return which pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard before: For who is to judge between the Briti&s;h parliament and the Provin|cial A&s;&s;emblies in the&s;e re&s;pects? Who will venture to a&s;certain in every ca&s;e what is exter|nal and general; and what is merely internal and provincial? Nay indeed, may not the very &s;ame things ju&s;tly pa&s;s under both denomina|tions, according as they are &s;een from different

points of view? Surely they may; and to convince any man of this, let him attend to the very catalogue of articles, with which this Gentleman hath him&s;elf pre&s;ented us. For at page 14, he ob&s;erves, <Q>That whatever related to the internal government, of any particular Colony, &s;hould be left to the Governor and A&s;&s;embly of that Colony to tran&s;act among them&s;elves;</Q> among which articles belong|ing to internal government he enumerates the building of Barracks, and of other Public Edi|fices; and yet both he and every man mu&s;t al|low, that the building of Barracks, of Forts and Fortre&s;&s;es, the making of King's Docks and ca|reening places for the Navy, the laying out of military roads, and the providing of magazines for provi&s;ions and military &s;tores, con&s;idered in another view, are of a general nature; in the erection and pre&s;ervation of which, the whole Briti&s;h Empire is deeply intere&s;ted. And yet were the Briti&s;h Parliament to frame laws, and to levy taxes on the AMERICANS for the&s;e pur|po&s;es, what outcries would immediately be rai&s;ed again&s;t the Mother-Country! Every Fortre&s;s, nay every Barrack, would be de&s;cribed as an odious badge of &s;lavery; and every little Magazine would be termed a monumennt of tyranny and de&s;potic power, and a prerogative for de&s;troying the &s;ew liberties that were le&s;t. Again, at the bottom of the &s;ame Page, he declares, that the authority of Parliament &s;hould be employed in &s;ettling the manner of quartering the King's troops in the &s;everal Colo|nies.
<PB N="34" REF="015119_0033_0F95D1CC6F115CB8">
I will not object to the interpo&s;ition of Par|liament in &s;uch a ca&s;e: For I well know, that if <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Parliament did not interfere, the troops would very often have no quarters at all; and yet this very circum&s;tance would afford an AMERICAN A&s;&s;embly the mo&s;t inviting oppor|tunity for exclamation and oppo&s;ition. <Q>What! the Briti&s;h Parliament to take upon them the manner of quartering troops in our own Province, and on our own Inhabitants! who &s;o proper Judges as our&s;elves, when or where, or after what manner, they &s;hould be quar|tered? And how came the Gentlemen, met at WESTMINSTER, to be acquainted with the circum&s;tances of our People, and the &s;ituation of places, better than we who re&s;ide on the &s;pot? No! The&s;e acts of the BRITISH Par|liament are all barefaced encroachments on our liberties, and open violations of our Rights and Properties: they are the chains which our pretended protectors, but in reality our EGYPTIAN ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, have been long forging for us.

<P>However, there is one point more which I cannot omit, becau&s;e it will throw a further light on this matter, and di&s;clo&s;e a new &s;cene of patriotic manoeuvres, and the wiles of Po|liticians: at page 13, this author lays down a general rule for the conduct of parliament with re&s;pect to America, <Q>That it ought to be made a &s;tanding order of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, never to pa&s;s any law, whe|ther for impo&s;ing a tax, or for regulating trade, or for any other purpo&s;e what&s;oever relating to any of the American Colonies, 'till one whole year after the fir&s;t reading of the bill; unle&s;s it be to renew &s;ome expiring laws of great importance, and of immediate and urgent nece&s;&s;ity, &s;uch as the act for billeting the King's Troops, and perhaps &s;ome few others that might be &s;pecially ex|cepted in the order.</Q></P>
<P>This is the re&s;triction in point of time, which our author propo&s;es to lay on the Par|liament of Great-Britain. <Q>They never mu&s;t pa&s;s any law for impo&s;ing a tax 'till one whole year after the fir&s;t reading of the bill:</Q> Why?&mdash;In order to give the &s;everal Colonies <Q>an opportunity of making proper repre&s;enta|tions again&s;t it, and to prevent the Parliament
<PB N="36" REF="015119_0035_0F95D1CDEFC95660">
from making injudicious laws, not &s;uited to the condition of the Colonies.</Q> A fine contrivance truly! and a mo&s;t effectual expe|dient to prevent the Parliament from ever making any laws to oblige the Americans to di&s;charge their duty towards their Mother-Country: For this Gentleman might have known, indeed it is hardly po&s;&s;ible, that the fact could have e&s;caped his notice, had he re|collected it, that this very circum&s;tance of a year's procra&s;tination was the main engine em|ployed to batter down the late &s;tamp-act. When the duty on &s;tamps was fir&s;t propo&s;ed, the Americans made as little objection to it, as could be &s;uppo&s;ed to be made to any new tax whatever, Nay, &s;everal of their popular Ora|tors and Leaders u&s;ed con&s;iderable intere&s;t to be employed as Agents in the di&s;tribution of the&s;e &s;tamps: and one among the re&s;t, whom I need not name, was more than ordinary a&s;&s;idious in his application on this head: So that had the Act pa&s;&s;ed within the u&s;ual time, in&s;tead of being a flaming American Patriot, he would pro|bably have acted the part of a Tax-Gatherer and an American Publican. But when the outs and the pouters on this &s;ide the water, &s;aw the advantage which the Mini&s;ter gave them by a whole year's delay, they eagerly &s;eized the op|portunity; Emi&s;&s;aries and Agents were di&s;|patched into all quarters;&mdash;the New&s;papers were filled with invectives again&s;t the new-intended Tax.

thing that was bad! letters upon letters were wrote to America to excite the People to a&s;&s;o|ciate, to remon&s;trate, and even to revolt. The mo&s;t ample promi&s;es were made from hence, of giving them all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which faction, and clamour, and mock-patrioti&s;m, could mu&s;|ter up. And then it was that this very man, this &s;elf-intended Publican, changed &s;ides, and commenced a zealous Patriot: Then he ap|peared at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons to cry down that very mea&s;ure which he him&s;elf had e&s;pou&s;ed; and then, as the avenging Angel of America,</P>
<L>"He rode in the Whirlwind to direct the Storm."</L>
<P>Well, the &s;torm fell on the Mini&s;ter for the time being, and over&s;et him. Our Outs at Home became the Ins; and the &s;torm having now done its bu&s;ine&s;s, they had no further oc|ca&s;ion for it, were its mo&s;t obedient humble Servants, and wi&s;hed it to &s;ub&s;ide. But here they found them&s;elves egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken. For the Americans had, in their turn, learnt the art of making tools of them, in&s;tead of being made tools by them: &s;o that having been taught by the&s;e Preceptors to feel their own weight and independance, they were not to be wheedled by &s;oothing and cajoling letters to give over their enterprize, or to become a tractable, obe|dient People for the future. In &s;hort, hence it came to pa&s;s, that even during the continuance of this new and favourite admini&s;tration, the American &s;pirit was ri&s;ing all the while, in&s;tead
<PB N="38" REF="015119_0037_0F95D1CF6E3577C0">
of &s;inking. And as like cau&s;es will always pro|duce like effects, e&s;pecially &s;ince things have been &s;uffered to grow to &s;uch an height, evident it is to common &s;en&s;e, that any future attempt of the Briti&s;h Parliament to levy a tax on Ame|rica, will meet with no better a fate than the Stamp-Act has done. Moreover a years de|lay in laying it on will be ju&s;t &s;o much time given the Colonies to prepare for battle; and woe to that admini&s;tration which &s;hall propo&s;e it; for they will certainly be overturned by the &s;ame arts and managements which the former were, and with much greater ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now have done with this Gentle|man's &s;cheme, were it not that I find him, at page 28, making a kind of apology to the Ame|ricans for the conduct of our parliament in pay|ing the King's debts of his civil li&s;t. And I own my&s;elf more hurt by this paragraph, than by all the re&s;t of his pamphlet: for as I am tho|roughly per&s;uaded, he wrote from conviction, and not from any &s;ini&s;ter views, one is &s;orry to find &s;o able, &s;o hone&s;t, and upright a man, carried away by the torrent of the times to &s;uch a degree, as to adopt notions, which are almo&s;t too crude for a club of Livery Poli|ticians met in &s;ome blind alley at a city ale|hou&s;e. His words are the&s;e:&mdash;<Q>It is certain, that no &s;uch (exorbitant) grants as are above mentioned have been made, unle&s;s in the &s;ingle in&s;tance of the &s;um of 513,000l. granted to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty for the di&s;charge of the debts of his civil li&s;t. And in this ca&s;e I
<PB N="39" REF="015119_0038_0F95D1D02DD6E8B8">
can ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that a motive of com|pa&s;&s;ion for a number of innocent per&s;ons who would otherwi&s;e have been &s;ufferers from that load upon his Maje&s;ty's revenue, and an affectionate de&s;ire of relieving their ex|cellent Sovereign (who has in no in&s;tance en|deavoured to violate the liberties of his Sub|jects) from the unworthy &s;treights and in|conveniences, ill becoming the royal dignity, into which &s;ome of his mini&s;ters had brought him by the injudicious management of his re|venue, may have induced many members of the Hou&s;e of Commons to con&s;ent to this grant, without any view to their own private intere&s;t; though at the &s;ame time I ac|knowledge it to be, con&s;idering all its cir|cum&s;tances, a dangerous compliance, and not worthy to be drawn into example.</Q></P>
<P>Now if the compliance of the Parliament in di&s;charging this debt was dangerous, the rea&s;on mu&s;t be, becau&s;e the circum&s;tance of contracting the debt it&s;elf was really infamous; therefore ought not to be avowed, but had better be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in tenderne&s;s to the royal cau&s;e. But can this author point out any &s;uch infamous circum&s;tances, if he were minded to make the di&s;covery?&mdash;I dare an&s;wer for him, that he cannot. And as I will not &s;uppo&s;e that he has more tales to tell than any other private Gentleman, or much le&s;s than he him&s;elf was an accomplice in, or privy to any &s;uch &s;cenes of iniquity as are here in&s;inuated.&mdash;I will now undertake to prove to him and the World, how
<PB N="40" REF="015119_0039_0F95D1D0EF39DFD0">
as great a debt as this, nay a much greater, might have been contracted in the &s;pace of ten years, without the lea&s;t impeachment of wa&s;te, profu&s;ion, mi&s;management, or any other mi&s;|application what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Every office, dignity, rank, or &s;tation has a certain character to &s;u&s;tain, which nece&s;&s;arily requires a corre&s;pondent train of expences; &s;o that whether you con&s;ider the demands upon a King with a &s;alary of 800,000l. a year, or the demands on a private Gentleman with only a clear rental of 800l. a year, the &s;cale of ex|pences mu&s;t be proportionate, the demands and expences being relative one to the other.</P>

<P>Add to this, 6thly, the uncommon dear|ne&s;s of all &s;orts of provi&s;ions, which for &s;ome years pa&s;t hath exceeded any thing known in former times; and which alone hath actually &s;welled the amount of Hou&s;e-keeping in every family to a very con&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P>Now the young Gentleman having &s;upported him&s;elf under the&s;e &s;everal pre&s;&s;ures and grow|ing expences for ten years together, at la&s;t is obliged to reque&s;t his neare&s;t friends and deare&s;t relations to grant him &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance; becau&s;e he is 513l. Or almo&s;t three quarters of a year in debt. Heavens! What a &s;um! and is this all again&s;t which &s;uch loud outcries have been rai&s;ed? yes this is all! Indignant reader, who|ever thou art, Engli&s;hman or American, lay thy hand on thy heart, and a&s;k thy&s;elf this plain que&s;tion, what would&s;t thou have thought of &s;uch a young Man, had he been thine own Son, thy Grand&s;on, or the heir-apparent of thy fortune? And what &s;ort of treatment would he have de&s;erved at thy hands? There|fore, <HI>mutato nomine.</HI>&mdash;But I will add no more: Let Nature and humanity, ju&s;tice and equity, plead their own cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We have now, I think, very &s;ufficiently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed every part of this gentleman's plan: nay, we have amply and particularly &s;hewn, that his apology to the Americans in behalf of the Briti&s;h Par|liament, for paying the arrears of his Maje&s;ty's Civil Li&s;t, was quite a needle&s;s thing. For if

no &s;tronger proofs can be brought of their ve|nality and corruption than this in&s;tance, they &s;till may be &s;afely tru&s;ted with the guardian&s;hip of tho&s;e liberties and properties, which they have hitherto not only pre&s;erved, but al&s;o &s;trengthened and encrea&s;ed to a degree un|known before in this, or any other country. In one word the &s;cheme of an union under our pre&s;ent con&s;ideration, is of &s;uch a nature, as would nece&s;&s;arily tend to exa&s;perate both par|ties, in&s;tead of mollifying or reconciling either, and as the Americans have already given us to under&s;tand, both in their Provincial A&s;&s;emblies, and at their General Congre&s;&s;es, that they will not accept of an union with us; and as Great-Britain ought not to petition for it; &s;urely more need not be added for laying the &s;cheme a&s;ide.

<HEAD>THIRD PLAN.</HEAD>
<P>The expediency of having recour&s;e to arms, in order to compel the Colonies to &s;ubmit to the authority and juri&s;diction of the &s;upreme
<PB N="44" REF="015119_0043_0F95D1D4ACB96AC8">
council of the Briti&s;h Empire, the Parliament of GREAT-BRITAIN.</P>
<P>In regard to which important point, the gentleman rea&s;ons after the following manner:&mdash;<Q>after &s;uch an offer (of an union, as above de&s;cribed) and the contemptuous refu&s;al of it by the Colonies, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, that they (the inhabitants of Great-Britain) will act as one man, to &s;upport the ju&s;t and law|ful, and nece&s;&s;ary authority of the &s;upreme Legi&s;lature of the Briti&s;h Nation over all the Dominions of the Crown. The ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e will give vigour to their mea&s;ures; and the Colonies that &s;hall have the folly and pre|&s;umption to re&s;i&s;t them, will be quickly re|duced to obedience.</Q></P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, nay indeed it is very probable, that if a war was to be &s;peedily undertaken before Great-Britain and Ireland had been too much exhau&s;ted of their inhabitants, emigrating to North-America,&mdash;the forces of the Mother-Country might prevail, and America, however unwilling, be forced to &s;ubmit. But alas! victo|ry alone is but a poor compen&s;ation for all the blood and trea&s;ure which mu&s;t be &s;pilt on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. Not to mention, that after a conque&s;t of their country, the Americans would certainly be le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed, even than they are at pre&s;ent, to become our good cu&s;tomers, and to take our manufactures in return for tho&s;e in|juries and oppre&s;&s;ions which they had &s;uffered from us:&mdash;I &s;ay, injuries and oppre&s;&s;ions; be|cau&s;e the Colonies would mo&s;t undoubtedly
<PB N="45" REF="015119_0044_0F95D1D56D0A74E0">
give no &s;ofter an appellation to this Conque&s;t, tho' perhaps it would be no other in it&s;elf, than a ju&s;t cha&s;ti&s;ement for the manifold offences they had committed. Moreover, as the Ameri|cans are endeavouring even at pre&s;ent to &s;et up all &s;orts of mechanic trades in order to rival us, or at lea&s;t to &s;uper&s;ede the u&s;e of our manu|factures in their country,&mdash;can any man &s;up|po&s;e, that their ardor for &s;etting up manufac|tures would be abated, by their being forced to deal at the one only European &s;hop, which they mo&s;t dete&s;ted?</P>
<P>But what is &s;till wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;though the Briti&s;h troops might over-run the great Con|tinent of North-America at fir&s;t, it doth by no means follow, that they could be able to main|tain a &s;uperiority in it afterwards for any length of time; and my rea&s;on is, becau&s;e the go|verning of a country after a peace, is a much more arduous ta&s;k, in certain circum&s;tances, than the conquering it during a war. Thus for example, when a peace en&s;ues (and &s;urely it is not intended that we &s;hall be forever in a &s;tate of war) then a civil con&s;titution of &s;ome kind or other mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be e&s;tabli&s;hed; and in the ca&s;e before us, there &s;eems to be no other alternative, but either the permitting the Colonies to enjoy once more tho&s;e advan|tages of Engli&s;h Liberty, and of an Engli&s;h Con&s;titution, which they had forfeited; or el&s;e a re&s;olution to govern them for the future by arbitrary &s;way and de&s;potic power.
<PB N="46" REF="015119_0045_0F95D1D62CB00870">
If the latter &s;hould be the plan adopted, I then humbly &s;ubmit it to be duly weighed and con&s;idered, what a baneful influence this Government a la pru&s;&s;e, would have on every other part of the Briti&s;h Empire. England free, and America in chains! And how &s;oon would the en&s;laved part of the Con&s;titution, and perhaps the greater, contaminate the free and the le&s;&s;er? Nay, as America was found to increa&s;e in &s;trength and numbers, an army of Engli&s;h-born &s;oldiers (for no others could be tru&s;ted) fir&s;t of 50,000, and afterwards per|haps of 100,000, would &s;carcely be &s;ufficient to keep the&s;e turbulent &s;pirits in awe, and to prevent them, at &s;uch a prodigious di&s;tance from the center of Government, from break|ing out into in&s;urrections and rebellions at every favourable opportunity. But if the former were to prevail, and a return of Engli&s;h Liberties was again to take place, it mu&s;t al&s;o follow, that the &s;y&s;tem of trials by juries mu&s;t return with them: and then, when Ame|rica &s;hall grow &s;tronger and &s;tronger every day, and England proportionably weaker, how is an in&s;urrection to be quelled in America? and what Engli&s;h officer, civil or military, would dare to do it? Nay, I a&s;k further, granting that he was &s;o brave, or rather &s;o fool-hardy, as to attempt to do his duty, who is to protect him in the execution of his office? Or how is he to be pre&s;erved, by due forms of law, again&s;t the determination of an American jury? a tumult is excited;&mdash;the military is called

forth;&mdash;the &s;oldiers are in&s;ulted;&mdash;many per|haps wounded, and &s;ome even killed. The patience of the officers worn out, and in their own defence, they are obliged to give the word of command to fire. The relations of tho&s;e who fell by this fire, bring on an appeal of blood. The American jury find the officers who commanded, and perhaps the whole corps who fired, guilty of wilful murder; and then all the power of the Crown, legally exerted, is not able to &s;ave the lives of the&s;e poor innocent men. Pitiable &s;ure is &s;uch a ca&s;e; and yet it is a ca&s;e which would and mu&s;t frequently then happen in the natural cour&s;e of things, accord|ing to our legal con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Perhaps it might be &s;aid, that American juries are as con&s;cientious as other juries in bringing in their verdicts according to law; and that it is very uncharitable even to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary.&mdash;Be it &s;o: But the que&s;tion here turns on, What will be the &s;ugge&s;tion of con|&s;cience in the brea&s;t of an American on &s;uch an occa&s;ion?&mdash;What would be his ideas of law, ju&s;tice, or equity, when England and America &s;tood in competition?&mdash;certainly, if ever the inhabitants of that country &s;hould come (and they are almo&s;t come already) to be fully per&s;uaded that the Briti&s;h parliament hath no right to make laws either to tax or to go|vern them (and the having once beaten them will not be taken as a convincing proof that we always have either the right or the power to beat them) then every attempt towards

throwing off this odious yoke, would appear in their eye, as &s;o many noble &s;truggles for the cau&s;e of liberty: and therefore the ba&s;e Engli&s;h hireling, who would dare to injure this &s;acred cau&s;e, de&s;erved to die a thou&s;and deaths. Such undoubtedly would be the language, and &s;uch the &s;entiments of the great majority of Americans whenever &s;uch a ca&s;e &s;hould happen. In a word, an erroneous con&s;cience, and a fal&s;e zeal, would have ju&s;t the &s;ame bad effects in the new world re&s;pecting civil government, as they formerly had in the old, in regard to religion: And therefore, either way, whether we &s;hould treat the&s;e Americans as an en&s;laved people, or whether we &s;hould re&s;tore to them, after a conque&s;t, the &s;ame con&s;titution which we enjoy our&s;elves, the final event would come to this,&mdash;That England would be the greate&s;t &s;ufferer; and that America is not to be governed again&s;t its own inclinations.

<P>Now, wild as &s;uch a &s;cheme may appear, there are certainly &s;ome Americans who &s;eriou&s;ly embrace it: and the late prodigious &s;warms of Emigrants encourage them to &s;uppo&s;e, that a time is approaching, when the Seat of Em|pire

But whatever events may be in the womb of time, or whatever revolutions may happen in the ri&s;e and fall of Empires, there is not the lea&s;t probability, that this country &s;hould ever become a pro|vince to North-America. For granting even, that it would be &s;o weakened and enfeebled by the&s;e Colony-drains, as not to be able to defend it&s;elf from invaders, yet America is at too great a di&s;tance to invade it at fir&s;t, much le&s;s to de|fend the conque&s;t of it afterwards, again&s;t the neighbouring powers of Europe: and as to any notion that we our&s;elves &s;hould prefer an American yoke to any other,&mdash;this &s;uppo&s;ition is chimerical indeed; becau&s;e it is much more probable, were things to come to &s;uch a dread|ful cri&s;is, that the Engli&s;h would rather &s;ubmit to a French yoke, than to an American; as being the le&s;&s;er indignity of the two. So that in &s;hort, if we mu&s;t rea&s;on in politics according to the Newtonian Principles in Philo&s;ophy.

<PB N="50" REF="015119_0049_0F95D1D92FAEE0F0">
North-American-Colonies, by declaring them to be a free and independent people, over whom we lay no claim; and then by offering to guar|antee this freedom and independence again&s;t all foreign invaders whatever.</P>
<P>And, in fact, what is all this but the natural and even the nece&s;&s;ary corollary to be deduced from each of the former rea&s;ons and ob&s;erva|tions? For if we neither can govern the Ame|ricans, nor be governed by them; if we can neither unite with them, nor ought to &s;ubdue them;&mdash;what remains, but to part with them on as friendly terms as we can? and if any may &s;hould think that he can rea&s;on better from the above premi&s;es, let him try.</P>
<P>But as the idea of &s;eparation, and the giving up the Colonies forever will &s;hock many weak people, who think, that there is neither happine&s;s nor &s;ecurity but in an overgrown unwieldy Empire, I will for their &s;akes enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;advantages attending &s;uch a disjunction; and then &s;hall &s;et forth the manifold advantages.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and capital &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;advantage is, That if we &s;eparate from the Colonies, we &s;hall lo&s;e their trade. But why &s;o? and how does this appear? The Colonies, we know by experience, will trade with any people, even with their bit|tere&s;t enemies, during the hotte&s;t of a war, and a war undertaken at their own earne&s;t re|que&s;t, and for their own &s;akes;&mdash;the Colonies, I &s;ay, will trade even with them, provided they &s;hall find it their intere&s;t &s;o to do. Why then
<PB N="51" REF="015119_0050_0F95D1D9ECEE3280">
&s;hould any man &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;ame &s;elf-intere&s;t will not induce them to trade with us? with us, I &s;ay, who are to commit no ho&s;tilities again&s;t them, but on the contrary, are &s;till to remain, if they plea&s;e, their Guardians and Pro|tectors?</P>
<P>Granting, therefore, that NORTH-AMERICA was to become independent of us, and we of them, the que&s;tion now before us will turn on this &s;ingle point,&mdash;can the Coloni&s;ts, in a gene|ral way, trade with any other European State to greater advantage than they can with Great-Britain? If they can, they certainly will; but if they cannot, we &s;hall &s;till retain their cu&s;tom, notwith&s;tanding we have parted with every claim of authority and juri&s;diction over them. Now, the native commodities and merchandize of North-America, which are the mo&s;t &s;aleable at an European market, are chiefly lumber, Ships, iron, train-oil, flax-&s;eed, &s;kins, furs, pitch, tar, turpentine, pearl-a&s;hes, indigo, tobacco, and rice: and I do aver, that, ex|cepting rice and tobacco, there is hardly one of the&s;e articles, for which an American could get &s;o good a price any where el&s;e, as he can in Great-Britain and Ireland. Nay, I ought to have excepted only rice; for as to tobacco, tho' great quantities of it are re-exported into France, yet it is well known, that the French might rai&s;e it at home, if they would, much cheaper than they can import it from our Co|lonies. The fact is this,&mdash;The Farm of to|bacco
<PB N="52" REF="015119_0051_0F95D1DAAE10F030">
is one of the great five farms, which make up the chief part of the Royal revenue; and therefore the Farmers General, for bye-ends of their own, have hitherto had intere&s;t enough with the Court to prohibit the cultiva|tion of it in Old France, under the &s;evere&s;t pe|nalties. But neverthele&s;s the real French Patri|ots, and particularly the Marquis de Mirabeau, have fully demon&s;trated, that it is the intere&s;t of the French government to encourage the cul|tivation of it; and have pointed out a &s;ure and ea&s;y method of collecting the duties; which was the &s;ole pretence of the Farmers General for &s;oliciting a prohibition. So that it is appre|hended, that the French government will at la&s;t open their eyes in this re&s;pect, and allow the cultivation of it. Tobacco therefore being likely to be &s;oon out of the que&s;tion, the only remaining article is rice; and this, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, would bear a better price at the Hamburgh or Dutch markets than it gene|rally doth in England. But as this is only one article, out of many, it &s;hould be further con|&s;idered, that even the Ships which import rice into England, generally bring &s;uch other pro|duce as would not be &s;aleable to advantage in other parts of Europe: &s;o that there is no great cau&s;e to fear, that we &s;hould con&s;iderably lo&s;e the trade even of this article, were the Colo|nies to be di&s;membered from us. Not to men|tion that all the coa&s;ts of the Mediterranean and the &s;outh of Europe are already &s;upplied with rice from the Colonies, in the &s;ame man|ner
<PB N="53" REF="015119_0052_0F95D1DB6F9E1FE0">
as if there had been an actual &s;eparation;&mdash;no rice-&s;hip bound to any place &s;outh of Cape Fini&s;terre being at all obliged to touch at any Port of Great-Britain. So much, therefore, as to the &s;taple exports of the Colonies.</P>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider their IMPORTS. And here one thing is very clear and certain, that whatever goods, merchandize, or manufactures, the merchants of Great-Britain can &s;ell to the re&s;t of Europe, they might &s;ell the &s;ame to the Colonies, if wanted: Becau&s;e it is evident, that the Colonies could not purcha&s;e &s;uch goods at a cheaper rate at any other European market. Now, let any one ca&s;t his eye over the bills of exports from London, Bri&s;tol, Liverpool, Hull, Gla&s;gow, &amp;c. &amp;c. and then he will &s;oon di&s;cover that excepting gold and &s;ilver lace, wines and brandies, &s;ome &s;orts of &s;ilks and linens, and perhaps a little paper and Gun-powder; I &s;ay, excepting the&s;e few articles, Great-Bri|tain is become a kind of a general mart for mo&s;t other commodities: and indeed were it not &s;o, how is it conceivable, that &s;o little a &s;pot as this i&s;land could have made &s;uch a fi|gure either in peace or war, as it hath lately done? How is it po&s;&s;ible that after having con|tracted a debt of nearly one hundred and forty millions, we &s;hould neverthele&s;s be able to make more rapid progre&s;&s;es in all &s;orts of improvements, u&s;eful and ornamental, public and private, agricolic and commercial, than any other nation ever did?&mdash;Fact it is, that
<PB N="54" REF="015119_0053_0F95D1DC2FA0C3A8">
the&s;e improvements have been made of late years, and are daily making: and facts are &s;tubborn things.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays the objector, you allow, that gold and &s;ilver lace,&mdash;that wines and brandies, &s;ome &s;orts of &s;ilks,&mdash;&s;ome &s;orts of paper, gun-powder, and perhaps other articles, can be purcha&s;ed at certain European markets on cheaper terms than they can in England: and therefore it follows, that we &s;hould certainly lo&s;e the&s;e branches of commerce by a &s;epara|tion, even &s;uppo&s;ing that we could retain the re&s;t. Indeed even this doth not follow; becau&s;e we have lo&s;t them already, as far as it was the intere&s;t of the colonies, that we &s;hould lo&s;e them. And if any man can doubt of this, let him but con&s;ider, that the lumber, and pro|vi&s;ion-ve&s;&s;els, which are continually running down from Bo&s;ton, Rhode-I&s;land, New-York, Philadelphia, Charles-Town, &amp;c. &amp;c. to Marti|nico, and the other French i&s;lands, bring home in return not only &s;ugars and mola&s;&s;es, but al&s;o French wines, &s;ilks, gold and &s;ilver lace, and in &s;hort every other article, in which they can find a profitable account: Moreover tho&s;e &s;hips, which &s;ail to Eu&s;tatia and Curacoa, trade with the Dutch, and con&s;equently with all the North of Europe, on the &s;ame principle. And as the &s;hips which &s;teer &s;outh of Cape Fini&s;terre, what do they do?&mdash;Doubtle&s;s, they purcha&s;e whatever commodities they find it their intere&s;t to purcha&s;e, and carry them home to North-America. Indeed what would hinder them from
<PB N="55" REF="015119_0054_0F95D1DCEFA41738">
acting agreeably to their own ideas of advan|tage in the&s;e re&s;pects? The Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers, perhaps, you may &s;ay, will hinder them, But alas! the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers of North-America, if they were ten times more numerous, and ten times more uncorrupt than they are, could not po&s;&s;ibly guard a tenth part of the coa&s;t. In &s;hort the&s;e things are &s;o very no|torious that they cannot be di&s;puted; and therefore, were the whole trade of North-America to be divided into two branches, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the voluntary, re&s;ulting from a free choice of the Americans them&s;elves, pur&s;uing their own intere&s;t, and the involuntary, in con&s;e|quence of compul&s;ory Acts of the Briti&s;h Par|liament;&mdash;this latter would appear &s;o very &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, as hardly to de&s;erve a name in an e&s;timate of national commerce.</P>
<P>The 2d objection again&s;t giving up the Co|lonies is, that &s;uch a mea&s;ure would greatly de|crea&s;e our &s;hipping and navigation, and con|&s;equently dimini&s;h the breed of &s;ailors. But this objection has been fully obviated already: For if we &s;hall not lo&s;e our trade, at lea&s;t in any important degree, even with the northern Colonies (and mo&s;t probably we &s;hall encrea&s;e it with other countries) then it follows, that nei|ther the quantity of &s;hipping, nor the breed of &s;ailors, can &s;uffer any con&s;iderable dimi|nution: So that this &s;uppo&s;ition is merely a panic, and has no foundation. Not to men|tion, that in proportion as the Americans &s;hall be obliged to exert them&s;elves to defend their
<PB N="56" REF="015119_0055_0F95D1DDAFBC61F8">
own coa&s;ts, in ca&s;e of a war; in the &s;ame proportion &s;hall Great-Britain be exonorated from that burden, and &s;hall have more &s;hips and men at command to protect her own channel Trade, and for other &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The 3d objection is, That if we were to give up the&s;e Colonies, the French would take im|mediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. Now this objec|tion is intirely built on the following very wild, very extravagant, and ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, It &s;uppo&s;es, that the Coloni&s;ts them&s;elves, who cannot brook our government, would like a French one much better. Great-Britain, it &s;eems, doth not grant them liberty enough; and therefore they have recour&s;e to France to obtain more:&mdash;That is, in plain Engli&s;h, our mild and limited Government, where preroga|tive is a&s;certained by law, where every man is at liberty to &s;eek for redre&s;s, and where po|pular clamours too often carry every thing before them,&mdash;is neverthele&s;s too &s;evere, too oppre&s;&s;ive, and too tyrannical for the &s;pirits and genius of Americans to bear; and therefore they will apply to an arbitrary, de&s;potic Govern|ment, where the people have no &s;hare in the Legi&s;lature, where there is no liberty of the Pre&s;s and where General Warrants and Letters des Cachets are irre&s;i&s;tible, in order to enjoy grea|ter freedoms than they have at pre&s;ent, and to be re&s;cued from the intolerable yoke, under which they now groan. What mon&s;trous ab&s;urdities are the&s;e? But even this is not all: For the&s;e Americans are repre&s;ented by this &s;uppo&s;ition,
<PB N="57" REF="015119_0056_0F95D1DE70515E98">
as not only preferring a French government to a Briti&s;h, but even to a government of their own modelling and chu&s;ing! For after they are &s;et free from any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their Mother-Country; after they are told, that for the future they mu&s;t endeavour to plea&s;e them&s;elves, &s;ee|ing we cannot plea&s;e them; then, in&s;tead of attempting to frame any popular governments for redre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e evils, of which they now &s;o bitterly complain,&mdash;they are repre&s;ented as throwing them&s;elves at once into the arms of France:&mdash;the Republican &s;pirit is to &s;ub&s;ide; the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re|&s;i&s;tance is to &s;ucceed; and, in&s;tead of &s;etting up for freedom and independence, they are to glory in having the honour of being numbered among the &s;laves of the Grand Monarch!</P>
<P>But 2dly, this matter may be further con|&s;idered in another point of view: for if it &s;hould be &s;aid, that the Americans might &s;till retain their Republican &s;pirit, tho' they &s;ub|mitted to a French government, becau&s;e the French, through policy; would permit them &s;o to do; then it remains to be con&s;idered, whether any arbitrary government can di&s;pen&s;e with &s;uch liberties as a Republican &s;pirit will require. An ab&s;olute freedom of the Pre&s;s! No con|troul on the liberty either of &s;peaking or writing on matters of &s;tate! New&s;papers and Pamphlets filled with the bittere&s;t invectives again&s;t the mea&s;ures of government! A&s;&s;oci|ations formed in every quarter to cry down Mini&s;terial Hirelings, and their dependants!
<PB N="58" REF="015119_0057_0F95D1DF2FB63008">
The votes and re&s;olutions of the Provincial A&s;&s;emblies to a&s;&s;ert their own authority and in|dependence! No landing of troops from Old France to quell In&s;urrections! No rai&s;ing of new levies in America! No quartering of Troops! No building of forts, or erecting of garri&s;ons! And, to &s;um up all, no rai&s;ing of money without the expre&s;s con&s;ent and appro|bation of the Provincial American Parliaments fir&s;t obtained for each of the&s;e purpo&s;es! Now I a&s;k any rea&s;onable man whether the&s;e things are compatible with any idea of an ar|bitrary, de&s;potic government? Nay more, whether the French King him&s;elf, or his mi|ni&s;ters would wi&s;h to have &s;uch notions as the&s;e in&s;tilled into the &s;ubjects of Old France? Yet in&s;tilled they mu&s;t be while a communi|cation is kept open between the two Countries; while corre&s;pondences are carried on; letters, pamphlets, and new&s;papers, pa&s;s and re-pa&s;s; and in &s;hort while the Americans are permitted to come into France, and Frenchmen into Ame|rica. So much therefore as to this cla&s;s of ob|jections. Indeed I might have in&s;i&s;ted further, that Great Britain alone could at any time pre|vent &s;uch an acqui&s;ition to be made by France, as is here &s;uppo&s;ed, if &s;he &s;hould think it nece&s;|&s;ary to interfere, and if &s;uch an acqui&s;ition of territory would really and truly be an addition of &s;trength in the political balance and &s;cale of power. But &s;urely I have &s;aid enough; and therefore let us now ha&s;ten briefly to point out,
<PB N="59" REF="015119_0058_0F95D1DFEC44CF38">
The manifold Advantages attendant on &s;uch a Plan.</P>
<P>And 1&s;t, A disjunction from the nothern Colonies would effectually put a &s;top to our pre&s;ent emigrations. By the laws of the land it is made a capital offence to inveigle arti|ficers and mechanics to leave the kingdom, but this law is unhappily &s;uper&s;eded at pre|&s;ent as far as the Colonies are concerned. Therefore when they come to be di&s;membered from us, it will operate as &s;trongly again&s;t them, and their kidnappers, as again&s;t others, and here it may be worth while to ob&s;erve, that the emigrants, who lately &s;ailed in &s;uch multitudes from the North of Scotland and more e&s;pecially from the North of Ireland, were far from being the mo&s;t indigent, or the lea&s;t capable of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in their own Country. No; it was not poverty or nece&s;&s;ity which compelled, but ambition which enticed them to for&s;ake their native &s;oil. For after they began to ta&s;te the &s;weets of indu&s;try, and to partake of the comforts of life, then they became a valuable prey for the&s;e harpies. In &s;hort, &s;uch were the per&s;ons to whom the&s;e &s;educers principally applied; becau&s;e they found that they had gotten &s;ome little &s;ub&s;tance together worth devouring. They therefore told them many plau&s;ible &s;tories&mdash;that if they would emigrate to North-America, they might have e&s;tates for nothing and be|come gentlemen forever; whereas, if they remained at home, they had nothing to ex|pect beyond the Condition of a wretched Jour|neyman, or a &s;mall laborious farmer. Nay,
<PB N="60" REF="015119_0059_0F95D1E0AE1754E8">
one of the&s;e fal&s;e guides was known to have put out public adverti&s;ements, &s;ome few years ago in the North of Ireland, wherein he engaged to carry all, who would follow him, into &s;uch a glorious Country, where there was neither tax, nor tythe, nor Landlord's rent to be paid. This was enough: it took with thou&s;ands: and this he might &s;afely engage to do. But at the &s;ame time, he ought to have told them (as Bi&s;hop BERKLEY in his queries ju&s;tly ob&s;erves) That a man may po&s;&s;e&s;s twenty miles &s;quare in this Country, and yet not be able to get a dinner.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Another great advantage to be derived from a &s;eparation is, that we &s;hall then &s;ave be|tween 3 and 400,000l. a year, by being di&s;charg|ed from the payment of any civil or military e&s;tabli&s;hment belonging to the Colonies; for which generous benefaction we receive at pre|&s;ent no other return than invectives and re|proaches.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The cea&s;ing of the payment of boun|ties on certain Colony productions will be another great &s;aving; perhaps not le&s;s than 200,000l. a year: and it is very remarkable, that the goods imported from the Colonies in con&s;equence of the&s;e bounties, could not have been imported into any other part of Europe, were there a liberty to do it; becau&s;e the freight and fir&s;t co&s;t would have amounted to more than they could be &s;old for: &s;o that in fact we give premiums to the Colonies for &s;elling goods to us, which would not have been &s;old at all any where el&s;e. However, when the pre&s;ent boun|ties &s;hall cea&s;e, we may then con&s;ider, at our

<P N="4">4thly, When we are no longer connected with the Colonies by the imaginary tie of an identity of government, than our merchant-exporters and manufacturers will have a better chance of having their debts paid, than they have at pre&s;ent: For as matters now &s;tand, the Coloni&s;ts chu&s;e to carry their ready ca&s;h to other nations, while they are contracting debts with their Mother-Country, with whom they think they can take great liberties: and provided they are tru&s;ted, they care not to what amount this debt &s;hall ri&s;e:&mdash;For when the time for payment draws on, they are &s;eized with a fit of patrioti&s;m; and then confederacies and a&s;&s;o|ciations are to di&s;charge all arrears; or at lea&s;t, are to po&s;tpone the payment of them SINE DIE.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, After a &s;eparation from the Colonies, our influence over them will be much greater than ever it was, &s;ince they began to feel their own weight and importance: For at pre&s;ent we are looked upon in no better a light than that of robbers and u&s;urpers; whereas, we &s;hall then be con&s;idered as their protectors, media|tors, and benefactors. The moment a &s;epara|tion takes effect, inte&s;tine quarrels will begin: For it is well known, that the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and di&s;&s;ention between Province and Province are now ready to &s;hoot forth; and that they are only kept down by the pre&s;ent combination
<PB N="62" REF="015119_0061_0F95D1E3251BF060">
all the Colonies again&s;t us, whom they unhap|pily fancy to be their common enemy. When therefore this object of their hatred &s;hall be re|moved by a declaration on our parts, that, &s;o far from u&s;urping all authority, we, from hence-forward will a&s;&s;ume none at all again&s;t their own con&s;ent; the weaker Provinces will intreat our protection again&s;t the &s;tronger; and the le&s;s cau|tious again&s;t the more crafty and de&s;igning: So that in &s;hort, in proportion as their republican &s;pirit &s;hall intrigue and cabal, they will &s;plit in|to parties, divide and &s;ub-divide, in the &s;ame proportion &s;hall we be called in to become their general Umpires and Referees. Not to mention, that many of the late and pre&s;ent Emigrants, when they &s;hall &s;ee the&s;e &s;torms ari&s;ing all around them, and when their promi&s;ed earthly paradi&s;e turns out to be a dreary, unwhole&s;ome, inho&s;pitable, and howling wilderne&s;s, many of them, I &s;ay, will probably return to us again, and take refuge at la&s;t in Old England, with all its faults and imperfections.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Our WEST-INDIA I&s;lands them&s;elves will receive &s;ignal benefit by this &s;eparation. In|deed their &s;ize and &s;ituation render them inca|pable of &s;ubtracting all obedience from us; and yet the bad precedents of their neighbours on the Continent hath &s;ometimes prompted them to &s;hew as refractory a &s;pirit as they well could.&mdash;But when they come to perceive, what are the bitter effects of this untractable di&s;po&s;ition, exemplified in the ca&s;e of the NORTH-AME|RICANS, it is probable, it is rea&s;onable to con|clude, that they will learn wi&s;dom by the mi&s;|carriages
<PB N="63" REF="015119_0062_0F95D1E3AD062750">
and &s;ufferings of the&s;e unhappy peo|ple; and that from henceforward they will re|vere the authority of a Government, which has the fewe&s;t faults, and grants the greate&s;t liber|ty, of any yet known upon earth.</P>
<P>But after all, there is one thing more, to which I mu&s;t make &s;ome reply. Many, perhaps mo&s;t of my readers, will be apt to a&s;k, what is all this about? And what doth this Author really mean? Can he &s;eriou&s;ly think, that becau&s;e he hath taken &s;uch pains to prove a &s;eparation to be a right mea&s;ure, that therefore we &s;hall &s;e|parate in good earne&s;t? and is he &s;till &s;o much a novice as not to know, that mea&s;ures are rarely adopted merely becau&s;e they are right, but becau&s;e they can &s;erve a pre&s;ent turn? Therefore let it be a&s;ked, what pre&s;ent conve|nience or advantage doth he propo&s;e either to admini&s;tration, or to anti-admini&s;tration, by the execution of his plan? This is coming to the point, and without it, all that he has &s;aid will pa&s;s for nothing.</P>
<P>I frankly acknowledge, I propo&s;e no pre&s;ent convenience or advantage to either; nay, I firm|ly believe, that no Mini&s;ter, as things are now circum&s;tanced, will dare to do &s;o much good to his Country; and as to the Herd of Anti-Mini|&s;ters, they, I am per&s;uaded, would not wi&s;h to &s;ee it done; becau&s;e it would deprive them of one of their mo&s;t plentiful &s;ources for clamour and detraction: and yet I have ob&s;erved, and have my&s;elf had &s;ome experience, that mea&s;ures evidently right will prevail at la&s;t: Therefore I make not the lea&s;t doubt but that a &s;eparation
<PB N="64" REF="015119_0063_0F95D1E46D2F90E0">
from the northern Colonies, and al&s;o another right mea&s;ure, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> a complete union and in|corporation with Ireland (however unpopular either of them may now appear) will both take place within half a century: And perhaps that which happens to be fir&s;t accompli&s;hed, will greatly accelerate the accompli&s;hment of the other. Indeed almo&s;t all people are apt to &s;tartle at fir&s;t at bold truths: But it is ob&s;ervable, that in proportion as they grow familiarized to them, and can &s;ee and con&s;ider them from dif|ferent points of view, their fears &s;ub&s;ide, and they become reconciled by degrees: Nay, it is not an uncommon thing for them to adopt tho&s;e &s;alutary mea&s;ures afterwards with as much zeal and ardor as they had rejected them before with anger and indignation.</P>
<P>Need I add, that the man, who will have re|&s;olution enough to advance any bold un welcome truth (unwelcome I mean at its fir&s;t appearance) ought to be &s;uch an one, who&s;e competency of fortune, joined to a natural independency of &s;pirit, places him in that happy &s;ituation, as to be equally indifferent to the &s;miles, or frowns either of the great, or the vulgar;</P>
<P>La&s;tly, &s;ome per&s;ons perhaps may wonder, that, being my&s;elf a clergyman, I have &s;aid no|thing about the per&s;ecution which the Church of England daily &s;uffers in America, by being de|nied tho&s;e rights which every other &s;ect of Chri|&s;tians &s;o amply enjoys. I own I have hitherto omitted to make mention of that circum&s;tance, not thro' inadvertance, but by de&s;ign; as being unwilling to embarra&s;s my general plan with what
<PB N="65" REF="015119_0064_0F95D1E52D082ED8">
might be deemed by &s;ome readers to be foreign to the &s;ubject: and therefore I &s;hall be very &s;hort in what I have to add at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>That each religious per&s;ua&s;ion ought to have a full toleration from the &s;tate to wor&s;hip Al|mighty God, according to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences, is to me &s;o clear a ca&s;e, that I &s;hall not attempt to make it clearer; and no|thing but the maintaining &s;ome mon&s;trous opi|nion incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of &s;ociety,&mdash;and that not barely in theory and &s;peculation, but by open practice and outward actions,&mdash;I &s;ay, nothing but the avowedly maintaining of &s;uch dangerous principles can ju&s;tify the magi&s;|trate in abridging any &s;et of men of the&s;e their natural rights. It is al&s;o equally evident, that the church of England doth not, cannot fall under the cen&s;ure of holding opinions incon|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the &s;tate, and the good of mankind,&mdash;even her enemies them&s;elves being judges: and yet the church of England alone doth not enjoy a toleration in that full extent, which is granted to the members of every other denomination. What then can be the cau&s;e of putting &s;o injurious a di&s;tinction between the church of England, and other churches in this re&s;pect? the rea&s;on is plain. The Americans have taken it into their heads to believe, that an epi&s;copate would operate as &s;ome further tie upon them, not to break loo&s;e from tho&s;e obligations which they owe to the Mother-Country; and that this is to be u&s;ed as an engine, under the ma&s;que of religion, to rivet tho&s;e chains, which they imagine we are
<PB N="66" REF="015119_0065_0F95D1E5F0D242B0">
forging for them. Let therefore the Mother-Country her&s;elf re&s;ign up all claim of autho|rity over them, as well eccle&s;ia&s;tical as civil; let her declare North America to be independent of Great-Britain in every re&s;pect whatever;&mdash;let her do this, I &s;ay, and then all their fears will vani&s;h away, and their panics be at an end: And then a bi&s;hop, who has no more connec|tions with England either in church or &s;tate, than he has with Germany, Sweden, or any other country, will be no longer looked upon in Ame|rica as a mon&s;ter, but a man. In &s;hort, when all motives for oppo&s;ition will be at an end, it is ob&s;ervable, that the oppo&s;ition it&s;elf &s;oon cea&s;es and dies away. In a word an epi&s;copate may then take place; and whether this new Eccle&s;ia&s;tical officer be called from a name derived from the Greek, the Latin, or the Ger|man,&mdash;that is, whether he be &s;tiled epi&s;copus, &s;uperintendent, &s;upervi&s;or, over&s;eer, &amp;c. &amp;c. it matters not, provided he be inve&s;ted with com|petent authority to ordain and confirm &s;uch of the members of his own per&s;ua&s;ion, as &s;hall vo|luntarily offer them&s;elves, and to in&s;pect the lives and morals of his own clergy.</P>

<HEAD>A few more WORDS, on the FREEDOM of the PRESS, Addre&s;&s;ed by the PRINTER, to the FRIENDS of LIBERTY in AMERICA.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Since the PRESS is FREE, LONG may it REMAIN FREE.</Q>
<BIBL>BELL.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was the &s;aying of an Ancient, and wi&s;e ENGLISHMAN, (TINDAL), who lived at the time of the Glorious Revolution in 1688, That, <Q>While the Freedom of the PRESS is pre&s;erved, all other Liberties, both Civil and Religious, will be &s;ecured to us, under &s;o faithful a Guardian.</Q> And it is the declaration of the modern, and noble VIRGINIANS, <Q>that the Freedom of the PRESS is one of the great bulwarks of Liberty, and can never be re&s;trained but by de&s;potic governments.</Q> Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e worthy and e&s;timable authorities, if there are yet any number of mi&s;taken men exi&s;ting, who under the &s;pecious pretence of there being a nece&s;&s;ity at &s;ome trying exigence for a temporary re&s;triction of the FREEDOM of the PRESS, and their fooli&s;h advice &s;hould at any one time be adopted, we may then bid a final adieu to every thing pertaining to Liberty: For it is more than probable, that like unto the wretched Briti&s;h Parliament, in the Year 1716, who pretended, there were at that time, too many Jacobites in the nation, to &s;uffer the triennial election of Members for that Hou&s;e.&mdash;They then tyrannically con&s;tituted them&s;elves into a &s;eptennial parliament: And for the la&s;t &s;ixty years, have illegally and au|daciou&s;ly

committed one continued in&s;ult upon the con&s;titution of the Kingdom, and upon the under&s;tandings of the whole body of the people in Great-Britain.&mdash;Now, if Americans will agreeable to the good old Engli&s;h advice&mdash;</P>
<L>"Learn to be wi&s;e, from others harm,</L>
<L>"They, they &s;hall do full well.</L>
<P>But, if according to the opinion of &s;ome violents again&s;t the freedom of enquiry, they will unwi&s;ely trample upon that greate&s;t of all privileges, the Liberty of the PRESS; then will they, like the fooli&s;h people of Britain, commit &s;uicide on their own liberties, and thus, entail upon them&s;elves, the &s;corn and contempt of all true and con&s;i&s;tent friends to real Liberty; becau&s;e, if new modes of Government, are either in reality, or in appearance, approaching to|wards the inhabitants of America; it is more peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary on the&s;e extraordinary oc|ca&s;ions, that the Liberty of the PRESS &s;hould be freely exerted: For, if in the&s;e changes, we do not fully retain all our pre&s;ent happy privileges, but weakly &s;uffer any re&s;trictions or curtailings of Liberty to advance upon us with new e&s;tabli&s;hments, it will afterwards be next to impo&s;&s;ible, to regain the de&s;irable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus far, the Printer &s;till thinks it indi&s;pen|&s;ibly his duty to &s;upport the Freedom of the PRESS, in which all the lovers of genuine Liberty are deeply intere&s;ted. And, if there are any, who think otherwi&s;e, they may if they plea&s;e, peru&s;e what follows.</P>
