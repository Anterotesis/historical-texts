In the <HI>Text,</HI> he names the very fact and bloody guilt, which was <HI>Murder</HI>; that Enormous Crime, the <HI>Guilt of Blood,</HI> &s;hed in a very ba&s;e and barbarous manner; for he <HI>Slew &V;riah with the Sword of the Children of Ammon.</HI> He cries to God for Mercy, and makes his Supplication to his Judge for Pardon.</P>
