<L>T<HI>O live's a Gift, to dye's a Debt that we</HI></L>
<L><HI>Each of us owe unto Mortality.</HI></L>
<L><HI>What though the dead do ghastly look, and we</HI></L>
<L><HI>Like Children frighted are even but to be</HI></L>
<L><HI>Spectators of a dying man or woman?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet nothing's to be fear'd that is so common.</HI></L>
<L><HI>It is not</HI> Death <HI>that we in them do see;</HI></L>
<L><HI>It's but the</HI> Mask <HI>wherewith 'twill vailed be.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet where's the man or woman that can look</HI></L>
<L><HI>Death in the face, as in some pleasing book?</HI></L>
<L><HI>Can we contented be to view our face</HI></L>
<L><HI>In such a dreadful, doleful Looking-glass?</HI></L>
<L><HI>O where's the man or woman that can cry,</HI></L>
<L>Behold I come, Death I desire to dye?</L>
<L><HI>O where's the man or woman that can say,</HI></L>
<L>Lord, I desire my dissolution day?</L>
<L><HI>And what's the reason 'tis so hard to dye,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To leave this World so full of vanity?</HI></L>
<L><HI>What makes it terrible? nought but the sense</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of</HI> guilt <HI>&amp;</HI> sin: <HI>Break down this potent fence,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And then be sure for aye you shall enjoy</HI></L>
<L><HI>Joyes everlasting, Everlasting joy.</HI></L>

<L>Each moment of my momentany time,</L>
