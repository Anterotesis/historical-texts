I was accused of treason, my property was confiscated and bestowed upon the new favorite. I escaped imprisonment by flight. How I was pursued and what I endured I will relate at another time. At present I will merely confine myself to the lucky turn of my fortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right&mdash;how you were metamorphosed from a noble|man into a peasant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My late father-in-law had rented a farm on my mo|ther's estate, and I had always heard him mentioned as an upright man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dal.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No longer knowing where I could be secure from the spies of my victorious rival, I suddenly remembered this old faithful servant. I clothed myself as a peasant, cut my hair, and on a summer's evening arrived at the house of Hans Wiedeman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll bet a wager you were received with open arms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gently rest the ashes of that worthy man!&mdash;At first I merely meant to stay with him till the storm was blown over, and I forgotten. That I might not, in the mean time, be without employment, I began to cultivate a part of the
<PB N="20" REF="037752_0020_100ED4A594666980">
garden. My Ann was then but fourteen years of age, and assisted me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes&mdash;I understand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken. Much as I admired her, I little thought that we should celebrate a day like this. But the garden soon became too confined for me, and I began to ac|company good Wiedeman to the field. I acquired a love of agriculture. I daily felt fresh air and industry enliven both my body and the mind. I was healthier than before, and I was happier than before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can easily conceive it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>One evening, as I was walking alone across the meadows, the idea suddenly struck me&mdash;Oh I could shew you the very spot&mdash;to forget the distressing vision of my younger days, to renounce the airy phantoms of ambition, and become a quiet peasant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dal.</SPEAKER>
<P>What thought honest old Wiedeman to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He shook his head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have done so, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He thought my intention a mere whim, and that, when the times altered, I should repent my resolution. In vain did I represent to him that he was old, that he wanted a hale son-in-law&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dal.</SPEAKER>
<P>He shook his head again, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He smiled, wished to convince me I was wrong, and when he found his arguments were ineffectual, he said he would try my resolution for two years. Finding, after the expiration of them, that I thought no more of court, and that his daughter sincerely loved me, he said: "God bless you!"&mdash;and God has blessed us.</P>
</SP>

<P>How often have I told you that fools do more mis|chief in the world than villains! A villain is generally pos|sessed of sense, and does not deal in defamation, unless he can thereby attain some end, but a fool is continually prat|ing.

<DIV3 TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE&mdash;A WOOD.</HEAD>
<P>Count Lohrstein is discovered in the back ground, sleeping under a tree&mdash;at his head lies a casket. Francis and Jacob are in con|versation towards the front of the stage.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is asleep. What think you, Jacob? Do you chuse to follow him through woods and bogs any longer? It's a strange kind of inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Scratching his head.</STAGE> It's not exactly inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, a dog leads a better life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>But our master himself fares no better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cook was the wisest of us, for he ran away, when he had only travelled one stage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>The count smiled at that; but last night when his <HI>valet</HI> disappeared, on whom he placed such firm reliance&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes&mdash;no doubt he took some valuable effects with him. My advice is, Jacob, that we do the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Leave the old gentleman quite alone!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he must dismiss us in a day or two, for how can he support us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how long shall we be able to endure such a life at this? We have passed six nights in the open air. If we espy a chimney, we leave it a quarter of a mile on one side. We buy our coarse bread at solitary shepherd's huts, and have nothing to drink but water from the springs we meet with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we have known better days in his service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it our fault that there was an end to those days? Who knows what crime he has committed? The prince would scarcely send huzzars in pursuit of him for nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="037752_0039_100F01DD84147EA0">
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn those fellows! They nearly caught us once or twice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if they should catch us, we may perhaps be doomed to keep our master company in prison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we must be near the borders now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well&mdash;can't the huzzars ride over the borders?&mdash;Besides, we are now in a worse situation than ever. Our horses are so tired that we shall be obliged to leave them, and if we be seen creeping through the thickets, we may be mistaken for robbers, and shot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang it, Francis, you frighten me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore, I say, let us be off before he awakes. Believe me, we shall be doing him a kindness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I thought so&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>He won't dismiss us, and he can't pay us. But if, when he awakes, he finds we have decamped, he'll be heartily glad to have got rid of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Casting a glance towards the Count.</STAGE> See! He begins to move.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us lose no more time. Does he owe you any wages?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, for a couple of months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>And me for a quarter of a year. We can't afford to make him a present of that. In the casket, there, he has several trinkets, rings, and so forth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely you would not take them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blockhead! Why not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Rob him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doesn't he owe us money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>But not so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fra.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw! Who knows what the baubles are worth? We can sell them at the first place we come to, and if they produce more than is due to us, we can send it to him by the post.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jac.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, if that can be done&mdash;</P>
</SP>

<P>Follow that foot-path. I'll be with you in a minute.</P>

I am of low origin, and my father was seized with the pious whim of making me a clergyman, without being able to bestow any thing on my education. My humble talents, however, procured me a patron, who was in easy circumstances, and who defrayed the expenses of my studies. To him I was obliged for every thing; and the library you have mentioned, was his present. About a year ago, this worthy man was plundered by the French, and obliged in his age to become a beggar.

<P>In reality an office, but all adapted to my inclination. Alas! There was a time, when domestic felicity in the arms of my first consort left me no other wish.&mdash;She died.&mdash;I for|sook my solitary country dwelling, rushed into the whirlpool of the city to dissipate my grief and to seek another affec|tionate heart; instead of which I found a deceitful and am|bitious woman, who from an admirer of a country life trans|formed me into a courtier, and used me as the tool of her designs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know the Countess, too.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Loh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some months previous to his dissolution, my wife, in combination with an abandoned daughter-in-law, engender|ed new plans. She knew the hereditary Prince disliked me, and that his father's death would be the signal for my dismissal; but she also knew the connection which subsisted between the young Prince and my daughter-in-law. With her, therefore, she began to cabal, finding she could no longer maintain her station by her own devices. Two furies suppressed the hatred which had endured for years, and the snakes from their hair were intertwined. <STAGE>Over powered with agony.</STAGE> Oh!</P>

<P>I was. I had been persuaded to so many things&mdash;had so often despotically forced my heart to silence, that, on this occasion too, they thought their game an easy one.

name with infamy. I was not even able to suppress some severe remarks occasioned by the abandoned life of my daughter-in-law. She thirsted for revenge, and my wife prudently took the strongest side. The Prince died&mdash;</P>

<P>I was prepared to receive my dismissal, but not to give account of every weakness, which might be laid to my charge during the twenty-seven years of my administration, of every injustice perhaps, to which at the pressing instiga|tion of my wife and her adherents, I had now and then been led. I was not prepared against proofs, which my wife had stolen from my cabinet, and lodged in the hands of my ene|mies.&mdash;Her reward was the permission to remain at court, and wander like the ghost of her former greatness, while I was doomed to perpetual imprisonment.</P>

<P>When I left you, I intended to travel a few miles before sun-set, but my heart was so heavy, that my feet could not support me. I went to the little inn, which was full of hussars. I left them&mdash;wandered into the garden, and seated myself under an elm, where I indulged myself in a flood of tears. Ere long two of the hussars joined me. They laughed at me for my effeminacy&mdash;as they called it&mdash;but I paid no regard to them. At length they ceased their taunts, and began to converse about their own concerns&mdash;in which, alas, I was too nearly concerned.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lew.</SPEAKER>
<P>My first education and my heart destined me to act a happy, but not a brilliant part in the world. My mother was formed for domestic comfort, and formed me for the en|joyment of domestic comfort. She died. An ambitious de|ceitful woman succeeded to my father's affections. Through her, he became minister&mdash;through her I too was to make my fortune (as it is called) at court. I was married to a wo|man, whom I knew not, but whom I discovered, when too late, to be the Prince's mistress. Yes. Then I might have raised myself, from step to step, in splendid infamy, and bending under the load of turpitude, might have climbed to the summit of courtly favor. But, thanks to Heaven, the sentiments, which she, who now enjoys celestial bliss, had graven in my mind, could not be eradicated by my step-mo|ther. Soon as I discovered the labyrinth, in which they had involved my inexperience, my resolution was irrevocably
<PB N="74" REF="037752_0074_100F02292102D228">
formed. I fled. From a delicacy, which was, perhaps car|ried to too great an excess, I took nothing with me. Beg I could not&mdash;I knew not how to work, so that at last, driven by hunger and despair, I accepted the offers of the recruit|ing party, with which you found me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, all is plain&mdash;and how do I rejoice to find it thus! How Willingly do I request your pardon for the sus|picion, which to-day I could not quite suppress!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lew.</SPEAKER>
<P>My character must have appeared dubious to you, and alas! that alone made my separation from you so painful.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Wel.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could I accuse my father&mdash;or could I assist him? Even now, I would not have broken my silence, had not anxiety for his safety compelled me to do it. He is pursued and suspected to be in this neighborhood. I am, at present incapable of assisting him; for my arm is maimed, and the loss of blood has so much reduced me, that I cannot even go in search of him, to give him notice that he is pursued. Oh, I beseech you, kind, benevolent, generous man, I beseech you, send all your people through the wood, the roads, the hills, and if they find him&mdash;have compassion on his age&mdash;on his misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
