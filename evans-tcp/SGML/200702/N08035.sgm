<Q>"As cold Waters to a thir&s;ty Soul; &s;o is good News from a far Country."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE are &s;o formed by the God of na|ture, doubtle&s;s for wi&s;e and good ends, that the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation to which we give the name of <HI>thir&s;t,</HI> is an in&s;eperable attendant on the want of &s;ome proper liquid. And as this want is increa&s;ed, &s;uch proportionably will be the increa&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s; and the unea&s;ine&s;s may gradually heighten, till it throws one into a &s;tate that is truly tormenting. The application of cooling

drink is fitted, by an e&s;tabli&s;hed law of hea|ven, not only to remove away this unea&s;ine&s;s, but to give plea&s;ure in the doing of it, by its manner of acting upon the organs of ta&s;te. There is &s;carce a keener perception of plea|&s;ure, than that which is felt by one that is a|thir&s;t upon being &s;atisfied with agreable drink. Hence the de&s;ire of &s;piritual good things, in tho&s;e who have had excited in them a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of God and religion, is repre&s;ented, in the &s;acred books, by the "cravings of a thir&s;ty man after drink." Hence the devout David, when he would expre&s;s the longing of his &s;oul to "appear before God in his &s;anctuary," re|&s;embles it to the "panting of an hart after the water-brooks." In like manner, "cold water to a thir&s;ty &s;oul" is the image under which the wi&s;e man would &s;ignifie, in my text, the gratefulne&s;s of "good news." Tis re|fre&s;hing to the &s;oul, as cold waters to the tongue when parched with thir&s;t: E&s;pecially is good news adapted to affect the heart with plea&s;ure, when it comes "from a far country," and is big with important ble&s;&s;ings, not to a few individuals only, but to communities, and numbers of them &s;cattered over a largely ex|tended continent.</P>
<P>SUCH is the "good news" lately brought us from the other &s;ide the great waters. No news
<PB N="7" REF="010255_0005_0F7E248FD7FA7168">
handed to us from Great-Britain, ever gave us a quicker &s;en&s;e, or higher degree, of plea|&s;ure. It rapidly &s;pread through the Colonies, and, as it pa&s;&s;ed along, opened in all hearts the &s;prings of joy. The emotion of a &s;oul ju&s;t fami&s;hed with thir&s;t, upon taking down a full draught of cold water, is but a faint emblem of the &s;uperior gladne&s;s with which we were univer&s;ally filled upon this great occa&s;ion. That was the language of our mouths, &s;ignify|ing the plea&s;urable &s;tate of our minds, "as cold waters to a thir&s;ty &s;oul; &s;o is this good news from a far country."</P>
<P>WHAT I have in view is, to take occa&s;ion from the&s;e words to call your attention to &s;ome of the important articles contained in the good news we have heard, which &s;o power|fully fit it to excite a pungent &s;en&s;e of plea|&s;ure in the brea&s;ts of all that inhabit the&s;e American lands. The way will then be pre|pared to point out to you the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t u&s;e we can make of the&s;e glad-tidings "from a far country."</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t article in this "good news," ob|viou&s;ly pre&s;enting it&s;elf to con&s;ideration, is the kind and righteous regard the &s;upreme autho|rity in England, to which we inviolably owe &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, has paid to the "commercial good"
<PB N="8" REF="010255_0006_0F7E24909C8623A8">
of the Nation at home, and its dependant Pro|vinces and I&s;lands. One of the expre&s;ly a&s;|&s;igned rea&s;ons for the REPEAL of the Stamp-Act, is declared in the&s;e words, "Whereas the continuance of &s;aid act&mdash;may be product|ive of con&s;equences greatly detrimental to the commercial intere&s;ts of the&s;e Kingdoms, may it therefore plea&s;e"&mdash;. The Engli&s;h Colonies and I&s;lands are certainly included in the words, "the&s;e Kingdoms;" for they are as truly parts of them as either Scotland, Ireland, or even Eng|land it&s;elf. It was therefore with a profe&s;&s;ed view to the commercial good, not only of the Nation at home, but of the Plantations al&s;o a|broad, that the authority of the Briti&s;h King and Parliament interpo&s;ed to render null and void that act, which, had it been continued in force, might, in its con&s;equences, have tended to the hurt of this grand intere&s;t, in&s;eperably connected with the welfare of both. From what more noble &s;ource could a REPEAL of this act have proceded? Not merely the re|peal, but that benevolent righteous regard to the public good which gave it birth, is an important ingredient in the news that has made us glad. And wherein could this "good news" have been better adapted to &s;often our hearts, &s;ooth our pa&s;&s;ions, and excite in us the &s;en&s;ations of unmingled joy? What that is conducive to our real happine&s;s, may we not
<PB N="9" REF="010255_0007_0F7E249156219E70">
expect from a King and Parliament, who&s;e regard to "the commercial intere&s;t" of the Briti&s;h Kingdoms has overpowered all oppo&s;ition from re&s;entment, the di&s;play of &s;overeign plea&s;ure, or whatever other cau&s;e, and influenced them to give up, even a CROWN-REVENUE for the &s;ake of a greater national good? With what confidence may we rely upon &s;uch a &s;upreme legi&s;lature for the redre&s;s of all grievances, e&s;pecially in the article of trade, and the devi&s;ing every wi&s;e and fit method to put and keep it in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate? Should any thing, in time to come, un|happily be brought into event, detrimental in its operation to the commerce between the Mother-country, and the&s;e Colonies, through mi&s;-repre|&s;entations from "lovers of them&s;elves more than lovers" of their King and Country, may we not encourage our&s;elves to hope, that the like ge|nerous public &s;pirit that has relieved us now, will again interpo&s;e it&s;elf on our behalf? Hap|py are we in being under the government of a King and Parliament, who can REPEAL, as well as enact a law, upon a view of it as tending to the public happine&s;s! How preferable is our condition to their's, who have nothing to expect but from the arbitrary will of tho&s;e, to whom they are &s;laves, rather than &s;ubjects?</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing, giving us &s;ingular plea&s;ure, contained in this "good news" is, the total re|moval
<PB N="10" REF="010255_0008_0F7E249213081200">
of a grievous burden we mu&s;t have &s;unk under, had it been continued. Had the real &s;tate of the Colonies been as well known at home as it is here, it is not ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;eable, any there would have thought the tax, impo&s;ed on us by the STAMP-ACT, was &s;utably adju&s;ted to our circum&s;tances and abilities. There is &s;carce a man in any of the Colonies, certainly there is not in the New-England ones, that would be deemed worthy of the name of a rich man in Great-Britain. There may be here and there a rare in&s;tance of one that may have ac|quired twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; and this is the mo&s;t that can be made of what they may be thought worth: But for the re&s;t, they are, generally &s;peaking, in a low condition, or, at be&s;t, not greatly ri&s;ing above it; though in different degrees, variou&s;ly placing them in the enjoyment of the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life. And &s;uch it might naturally be expect|ed would be the true &s;tate of the Coloni&s;ts; as the lands they po&s;&s;e&s;s in this NEW COUNTRY could not have been &s;ubdued and fitted for pro|fitable u&s;e, but by labor too expen&s;ive to allow of their being, at pre&s;ent, much increa&s;ed in wealth. This labor indeed may properly be con&s;idered as a natural tax, which, though it has made way for an a&s;toni&s;hing increa&s;e of &s;ubjects to the Briti&s;h Empire, greatly adding to its dig|nity
<PB N="11" REF="010255_0009_0F7E249311B38650">
and &s;trength, has yet been the occa&s;ion of keeping us poor and low.&mdash;It ought al&s;o to be remembered, the occa&s;ions, in a NEW COUNTRY, for the grant or purcha&s;e of property, with the obligations ari&s;ing therefrom, and in in&s;tances of comparatively &s;mall value, are unavoidably more numerous than in tho&s;e that have been long &s;et|tled. The occa&s;ions al&s;o for recour&s;e to the law are, in like manner, va&s;tly multiplied: For which rea&s;on, the &s;ame tax by <HI>&s;tamped-paper</HI> would take va&s;tly more in proportion from the people here, than in England. And what would have rendered this duty the more hard and &s;e|vere is, that it mu&s;t have been paid in addition to the Government-tax here, which was, I have good rea&s;on to think, more heavy on us in the late war, and is &s;o &s;till on account of the great debt then contracted, at lea&s;t in this province, in proportion to our numbers and abilities, than that which, in every way, was laid on the peo|ple either of Scotland, Ireland, or England.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have been a&s;&s;ured by a Gentleman of reputation and fortune, in this Town, that, in the late time of war, he &s;ent one of his rate-bills to a corre&s;pon|dent of note in London, for his judgment upon it; and had this an&s;wer in return from his friend, "that he did not believe there was a man in all England, who paid &s;o much, in proportion, to|wards the &s;upport of the Government." It will render the above account the more ea&s;ily credible, if I inform the reader, that I have lately and pur|po&s;ely conver&s;ed with one of the ASSESSORS of this Town, who has been annually cho&s;en by them in|to this office for a great number of years, for which rea&s;on he may be thought a per&s;on of integrity, and one that may be depended on; and he declares to me, that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment upon this Town, parti|cularly in one of the years when the tax on account of the war was great, was as follows: On <HI>per&s;onal</HI> e&s;tate, thirteen &s;hillings and four pence on the pound, that is to &s;ay, if a man's income from money at intere&s;t, or in any other way, was &s;ixty pounds per annum, he was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ixty times thirteen &s;hil|lings and four pence, and in this proportion whe|ther the &s;um was more or le&s;s: On <HI>real</HI> e&s;tate, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment was at the rate of &s;ix years income, that is to &s;ay, if a man's hou&s;e or land was valued at two hundred pounds per annum income, this two hundred pounds was multiplied by &s;ix, amounting to twelve hundred pounds, and the intere&s;t of this twelve hundred pounds, that is, &s;eventy two pounds was the &s;um he was obliged to pay. Be&s;ides this, the rate upon every man's pole, and the poles of all the males in his hou&s;e upwards of &s;ixteen years of age, was about nineteen &s;hillings lawful money, which is only one quarter part &s;hort of &s;terling. Over and above all this, they paid their part of an exci&s;e that was laid upon Tea, Coffee, Rum and Wine, a|mounting to a very con&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P>How it was in the other Provinces, or in the other Towns of this, I know not; but it may be relied on as fact, that this was the tax levied upon the Town of Bo&s;ton. And it has been great ever &s;ince, tho' not &s;o enormou&s;ly &s;o as at that time. Every one may now judge, whether we had not abundant rea|&s;on for mournful complaint, when, in addition to the va&s;t &s;ums (con&s;idering our numbers and abilities) we were obliged to pay, we were loaded with the STAMP-DUTY; which would, in a few years, have taken away all our money, and rendered us ab&s;o|lutely incapable, either of &s;upporting the Govern|ment here, or of carrying on any &s;ort of commerce, unle&s;s by an exchange of commodities</P></NOTE>
<PB N="12" REF="010255_0010_0F7E2493A7E90698">
This if mentioned cur&s;orily, was never, that I remember enlarged upon, and &s;et in a &s;triking light, in any of the papers wrote in the late times, as it might ea&s;ily have been done, and to good purpo&s;e&mdash;Be&s;ides all which, 'tis undoubt|edly true, that the circulating money in all the Colonies would not have been &s;ufficient to have
<PB N="13" REF="010255_0011_0F7E249813F010A0">
paid the Stamp-duty only for two years; and an effectual bar was put in the way of the intro|duction of more, by the re&s;traints that were laid upon our trade in tho&s;e in&s;tances wherein it might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, have been procured.</P>
<P>IT was this grievance that occa&s;ioned the bit|ter complaint all over the&s;e lands, "we are de|nied &s;traw, and yet the full tale of bricks is re|quired of us!" Or, as it was otherwi&s;e uttered, We mu&s;t &s;oon be obliged "to borrow money for the King's tribute, and that upon our lands. Yet now our fle&s;h is as the fle&s;h of our brethren, our children as their children: And lo! We mu&s;t bring into bondage our &s;ons and our daugh|ters to be &s;ervants." We &s;hould have been &s;tu|pid, had not a &s;pirit been excited in us to apply, in all rea&s;onable ways, for the removal of &s;o in&s;upportable a burden. And &s;uch an union in
<PB N="14" REF="010255_0012_0F7E2498EE1E9C30">
&s;pirit was never before &s;een in the Colonies: Nor was there ever &s;uch univer&s;al joy as upon the news of our deliverance from that which might have proved a yoke, the mo&s;t grievous that was ever laid upon our necks. It affected in all hearts the lively perceptions of plea&s;ure, filling our mouths with laughter. No man ap|peared without a &s;mile in his countenance. No one met his friend, but he bid him joy. That was our united &s;ong of prai&s;e, "Thou ha&s;t turn|ed for us our mourning into dancing; thou ha&s;t put off our &s;ackcloth, and girded us with glad|ne&s;s.&mdash;Our glory [our tongue] &s;hall &s;ing prai&s;e to thee, and not be &s;ilent: O Lord our God! we will give thanks to thee forever."</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing, in this "news," making it "good," is the hopeful pro&s;pect it gives us of being continued in the enjoyment of certain li|berties and privileges, valued by us next to life it&s;elf. Such are tho&s;e of being "tried by our equals," and of "making grants for the &s;upport of government of that which is our own, either in per&s;on, or by repre&s;entatives we have cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e." Whether the Coloni&s;ts were in|ve&s;ted with a RIGHT to the&s;e liberties and pri|vileges that ought not be wre&s;ted from them, or whether they were not, tis the truth of fact, that they really thought they were: All of them as natural heirs to it, by being born &s;ub|jects
<PB N="15" REF="010255_0013_0F7E2499AC4DF6F8">
to the Briti&s;h Crown; and &s;ome of them, by additional charter-grants, the legality of which, in&s;tead of being conte&s;ted, have all along, from the days of our fathers, been a&s;&s;ented to, and allowed of, by the &s;upreme authority at home. And they imagined, whether ju&s;tly, or not. I di&s;pute not, that their RIGHT to the free and full enjoyment of the&s;e privileges was their righteous due in con&s;equence of what they, and their fore-fathers, had done and &s;uffered in &s;ub|duing and defending the&s;e American lands, not only for their own &s;upport, but to add extent, &s;trength and glory to the Briti&s;h-Crown. And as it had been early and deeply impre&s;&s;ed on their minds, that their Charter-privileges were RIGHTS that had been dearly paid for by a va&s;t expence of blood, trea&s;ure and labor, without which this continent mu&s;t have &s;till remained in a wilderne&s;s-&s;tate, and the property of &s;avages only; it could not but &s;trongly put in motion their pa&s;&s;ion of grief, when they were laid un|der a Parliamentary re&s;traint as to the exerci&s;e of that liberty, they e&s;teemed their greate&s;t glory. It was eminently this that filled their minds with jealou&s;ie, and at length a &s;ettled fear, le&s;t they &s;hould gradually be brought into a &s;tate of the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery. This it was that gave ri&s;e to the cry, which became general thoughout the Colonies, "we &s;hall be made to &s;erve as bond-&s;ervants.&mdash;Our lives will be bitter with hard
<PB N="16" REF="010255_0014_0F7E249A61C366F0">
bondage." Nor were the Jews more plea&s;ed with the royal provi&s;ion in their day, which, under God, delivered them from their bondage in Egypt, than were the Coloni&s;ts with the REPEAL of that act which had &s;o greatly alarmed their fears, and troubled their hearts. It was to them as "life from the dead." They "rejoiced and were glad." And it gave &s;trength and vigor to their joy, while they looked upon this REPEAL, not merely as taking off the grievous re&s;traint that had been laid upon their liberties and pri|vileges, but as containing in it an intention of continued indulgence in the free exerci&s;e of them. Tis in this view of it, that they exult as tho&s;e who are "glad in heart;" e&s;teeming them&s;elves happy beyond almo&s;t any people now living on the face of the earth. May they ever be this happy people! And ever have "God for their Lord!"</P>
<P>THIS news is yet further welcome to us, as it has made way for the return of our love, in all its genuine exerci&s;es, towards tho&s;e on the other &s;ide of the atlantic, who, in common with our&s;elves, profe&s;s &s;ubjection to the &s;ame mo&s;t gracious Sovereign. The affectionate regard of the American inhabitants for their Mother Coun|try, was never exceeded by any Coloni&s;ts, in any part, or age of the world. We e&s;teemed our|&s;elves parts of one whole, members of the &s;ame
<PB N="17" REF="010255_0015_0F7E249B146BF760">
collective body. What affected the people of England, affected us. We partook of their joys and &s;orrows; "rejoicing when they re|joiced, and weeping when they wept." Ad|ver&s;e things in the conduct of providence to|wards them alarmed our fears, and gave us pain; while pro&s;perous events dilated our hearts, and in proportion to their number and greatne&s;s. This tender &s;ympathy with our brethren at home, it is acknowledged, began to langui&s;h from the commencement of a late Parliamentary act. There aro&s;e hereupon a general &s;u&s;picion, whether they e&s;teemed us brethren, and treated us with that kindne&s;s we might ju&s;tly expect from them. This jealou&s;ie, working in our brea&s;ts, cooled the fervor of our love; and had that act been continued in force, it might have gradually brought on an alienation of heart, that would have been greatly detrimental to them, as it would al&s;o have been to our&s;elves.&mdash;But the REPEAL, of which we have had authentic accounts, has opened the channels for a full flow of our for|mer affection towards our brethren in Great-Britain. Unhappy jealou&s;ies, uncomfortable &s;urmi&s;ings and heart-burnings are now re|moved; and we perceive the motion of an affection for the Country from whence our fore-fathers came, which would influence us
<PB N="18" REF="010255_0016_0F7E249D0F2580A0">
to the mo&s;t vigorous exertions, as we might be called, to promote their welfare, looking upon it, in a &s;en&s;e, our own. We again feel with them, and for them; and are happy or unhappy, as they are either in pro&s;perous or adver&s;e circum&s;tances. We can, and do, with all &s;incerity, "pray for the peace of Great-Britain, and that they may pro&s;per that love her," adopting tho&s;e words of the devout P&s;almi&s;t, "Peace be within thy walls, and pro&s;perity within thy palaces. For our brethren's &s;ake we will &s;ay, peace be within thee."</P>
<P>IN fine, this news is refre&s;hing to us "as cold waters to a thir&s;ty &s;oul," as it has effected an alteration in the &s;tate of things among us un&s;peakably to our advantage. There is no way in which we can &s;o &s;trikingly be made &s;en&s;ible of this, as by contra&s;ting the &s;tate we were lately in, and the much wor&s;e one we &s;hould &s;oon have been in had the Stamp-Act been enforced, with that happy one we are put into by its repeal.</P>
<P>UPON its being made certain to the Colo|nies, that the Stamp-Act had pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es of Parliament, and received the King's fiat, a general &s;pirit of unea&s;ine&s;s at once took place, which, gradually increa&s;ing, &s;oon di&s;covered
<PB N="19" REF="010255_0017_0F7E249DA1C3AD40">
it&s;elf, by the wi&s;er &s;ons of liberty, in laudable endeavors to obtain relief; though, by others, in murmurings and complaints, in anger and cla|mour, in bitterne&s;s, wrath and &s;trife; and by &s;ome evil-minded per&s;ons, taking occa&s;ion herefor from the general ferment of men's minds, in tho&s;e violent out-rages upon the pro|perty of others, which, by being repre&s;ented in an undue light, may have reflected di&s;honor upon a country which has an abhorrence of &s;uch injurious conduct. The Colonie&s; were never before in a &s;tate of &s;uch di&s;content, anxiety and perplexing &s;ollicitude: Some de|&s;pairing of a redre&s;s, &s;ome hoping for it, and all fearing what would be the event. And had it been the determination of the King and Parliament to have carried the STAMP-ACT into effect by &s;hips of war, and an embarkati|on of troops, their condition, however unhappy before, would have been inconceivably more &s;o. They mu&s;t either have &s;ubmited to what they thought an in&s;upportable burden, and have parted with their property without any will of their own, or have &s;tood upon their defence; in either of which ca&s;es, their &s;itua|tion mu&s;t have been deplorably &s;ad. So far as I am able to judge from that firmne&s;s of mind and re&s;olution of &s;pirit, which appeared among all &s;orts of per&s;ons, as grounded upon

Tis certainly true, there may be &s;uch exerci&s;e of power, and in in&s;tances of &s;uch a nature, as to render non-&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion war|rantable upon the foot of rea&s;on and righteou&s;ne&s;s: Otherwi&s;e it will be difficult, if po&s;&s;ible, to ju&s;tifie the REVOLUTION, and that ESTABLISHMENT in con&s;equence of it, upon which his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty &s;its upon the Briti&s;h throne.

Whether it did, or not, is a que&s;tion it would be impertinent in me to meddle with. It is the truth of fact, that the Coloni&s;ts generally and really thought it did; and that it might be oppo&s;ed without their incurring the guilt of di&s;loyalty or rebellion; and they were led into this way of thinking upon what they ima|gined were the principles which, in their operation, gave KING WILLIAM, and QUEEN MARY, of ble&s;&s;ed memory, the Crown of England.</NOTE> And had they, upon this principle, whether ill or well founded, &s;tood upon their defence, what mu&s;t have been the effect?

terrible evils that may be expected as the at|tendants on a &s;tate of civil war. No language can de&s;cribe the di&s;tre&s;&s;es, in all their various kinds and degrees, which would have made us mi&s;erable. God only knows how long they might have continued, and whether they would have ended in any thing &s;hort of our total ruin. Nor would the Mother-Country, whatever &s;ome might imagine, have been untouched with what was doing in the Colonies. Tho&s;e millions that were due from this continent to Great-Britain, could not have been paid;&mdash;a &s;top, a total &s;top, would have been put to the importation of tho&s;e manufactures which are the &s;upport of thou&s;ands at home, often re|peated.

WE may now be ea&s;ie in our minds, con|tented with our condition. We may be at peace and quiet among our&s;elves, every one minding his own bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P>UPON &s;uch a change in the &s;tate of our cir|cum&s;tances, we &s;hould be lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of duty and gratitude, and act as though we had no under&s;tanding, if our hearts did not expand with joy.

<P>WE have already had our rejoicings, in the civil &s;en&s;e, upon the "glad-tidings" from our Mother-Country; and tis to our honor, that they were carried on &s;o univer&s;ally within the bounds of a decent warrantable regularity. There was never, among us, &s;uch a collection of all &s;orts of people upon any public occa&s;ion: Nor were the methods in which they &s;ignified their joy ever &s;o beautifully varied and multi|plied, and yet, none had rea&s;on to complain

of di&s;orderly conduct. The &s;how was &s;ea&s;ona|bly ended, and we had afterwards a perfectly quiet night. There has indeed been no public di&s;turbance &s;ince the outrage at Lieut.

THOUGH our civil joy has been expre&s;&s;ed in a decent orderly way, it would be but a poor piti|ful thing, &s;hould we re&s;t here, and not make our religious grateful acknowledgments to the &s;u|preme Ruler of the world, to who&s;e &s;uper intend|ing providence it is principally to be a&s;cribed, that we have had "given us &s;o great deliver|ance." Whatever were the means or in&s;tru|ments in order to this, that glorious being, who&s;e throne is in the heavens, and who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all, had the chief hand herein. He &s;at at the helm, and &s;o governed all things re|lative to it, as to bring it to this happy i&s;&s;ue. It was under his alwi&s;e over-ruling influence, that a SPIRIT was rai&s;ed in all the Colonies no|bly to a&s;&s;ert their freedom as men, and Engli&s;h-born &s;ubjects; a &s;pirit, which, in the cour&s;e of it's operation, was highly &s;erviceable, not by any irregularities it might be the occa&s;ion of, [in this imperfect &s;tate, they will more or le&s;s mix them&s;elves with every thing great and good] but by it's manly efforts, &s;etting forth the rea|&s;ons they had for complaint in a fair, ju&s;t, and &s;trongly convincing light; hereby awakening the attention of Great-Britain, opening the eyes of the merchants and manufacturers there, and en|gaging them, for their own intere&s;t as well as that of America to exert them&s;elves in all rea|&s;onable ways to help us: It was under the
<PB N="28" REF="010255_0026_0F7E24A7AEF57FE8">
&s;ame all governing influence, that the late mini|&s;try, full of projections tending to the hurt of the&s;e Colonies, was &s;o &s;ea&s;onably changed into the pre|&s;ent patriotic one, which is happily di&s;po&s;ed, in all the methods of wi&s;dom, to promote our welfare:</P>
<P>It was under the &s;ame influence &s;till, that &s;o many friends of eminent character were rai&s;ed up, and &s;pirited to appear advocates on our behalf, and plead our cau&s;e with irre&s;i&s;table force: It was under this &s;ame influence al&s;o, that the heart of our King, and the Briti&s;h Parliament, were &s;o turned in favor to us as to rever&s;e that decree, which, had it been e&s;tabli&s;hed, would have thrown this whole continent, if not the nation it&s;elf, into a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion: In &s;hort, it was ultimately owing to this influence of the God of heaven, that the thoughts, the views, the purpo&s;es, the &s;peeches, the writings, and the whole conduct of all who were engaged in this great affair, were &s;o over-ruled to bring into effect the de&s;ired happy event.</P>
<P>AND &s;hall we not make all due acknowledg|ments to the great Sovereign of the world on this joyful occa&s;ion? Let us, my brethren, take care that our hearts be &s;utably touched with a &s;en&s;e of the bonds we are under to the Lord of the univer&s;e; and let us expre&s;s the joy and grati|tude of our hearts by greatly prai&s;ing him for the greatne&s;s of his goodne&s;s, in thus &s;cattering our

fears, removing away our burdens, and continu|ing us in the enjoyment of our mo&s;t highly va|lued liberties and privileges. And let us not only prai&s;e him with our lips, rendering thanks to his holy name; but let us honor him by a well ordered conver&s;ation. "Behold, to obey is better than &s;acrifice." And "to love the Lord our God with all our heart, and mind and &s;trength, and to love our neighbour as our&s;elves, is better than whole burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices." Acti|ons &s;peak much louder than words. In vain &s;hall we pretend, that we are joyful in God, or thankful to him, if it is not our endeavor, as we have been taught by the grace of God, which has appeared to us by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to "deny all un|godline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in the world." doing all things what&s;oever it has plea&s;ed God to com|mand us.</P>
<P>AND as he has particularly enjoined it on us to be "&s;ubject to the higher powers, ordained by him to be his mini&s;ters for good," we cannot, upon this occa&s;ion, more properly expre&s;s our gra|titude to him, than by approving our&s;elves duti|ful and loyal to the gracious King, whom he has placed over us. Not that we can be ju&s;tly tax|ed with the want of love or &s;ubjection to the Briti&s;h Throne. We may have been abu&s;ed by

fal&s;e and injurious repre&s;entations upon this head: But King GEORGE the IIId has no &s;ubjects, not within the realm of England it&s;elf, that are more &s;trongly attached to his per&s;on and family, that bear a more &s;incere and ardent affection to|wards him, or that would exert them&s;elves with more life and &s;pirit in defence of his crown and dignity.&mdash;But it may notwith&s;tanding. at this time, be &s;ea&s;onable to &s;tir up your minds, by putting you in remembrance of your duty to "pray for Kings, and all that are in &s;ubordinate authority under them," and to "honor and obey them in the Lord." And, if we &s;hould take oc|ca&s;ion from the great lenity and conde&s;cending goodne&s;s of tho&s;e, who are &s;upreme in authority over us not to "de&s;pi&s;e government." not to "&s;peak evil of dignities," not to go into any method of un&s;eemly di&s;orderly conduct; but to "lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty," every man moving in his own pro|per &s;phere, and taking due care to "render un|to Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ar and to God the things that are God's;"&mdash;we &s;hould honor our &s;elves, an&s;wer the expectations of tho&s;e who have dealt thus favorably with us; and, what is more, we &s;hould expre&s;s a becoming regard to the governing-plea&s;ure of almighty God.</P>

It would al&s;o be a &s;utable return of gratitude to God, if we entertained in our minds, and were ready to expre&s;s in all proper ways, a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the obligations we are under to tho&s;e Patrons of liberty and righteou&s;ne&s;s, who were the in|&s;truments employed by him and who&s;e wi&s;e and powerful endeavors, under his ble&s;&s;ing, were effectual to promote at once the intere&s;t of the nation at home, and of the&s;e di&s;tant Colonies.
