<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE world is already full of books; and the people of God are abundantly furni&s;hed with excellent books upon divine &s;ubjects; and, it &s;eems, that every &s;ubject has been writ|ten upon over &amp; over again: and the people in very deed have had precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little; and &s;o in the whole, they have much, yea, very much they have enough and more than enough. And when I come to con|&s;ider the&s;e things, I am ready to &s;ay with my&s;elf, What folly and madne&s;s is it in me to &s;uffer any thing of mine to appear in print, to expo&s;e my ignorance to the world.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It &s;eems altogether unlikely that my performance will do any manner of &s;ervice in the world, &s;ince the mo&s;t excellent writings of worthy and learned men are di&s;regarded. But there are two or three con&s;iderations that have induced me to be willing, to &s;uffer my broken hints to appear in the world. One is, that the books that are in the world are written in very high and refined lan|guage, and the &s;ermons that are delivered every &s;abbath in general, are in a very high and lofty &s;tile, &s;o that the common people under&s;tand but little of them. But I think they can't help under&s;tanding my talk; it is common, plain, every day talk: little children may under&s;tand me. And poor Negroes <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and fully under&s;tand my meaning, and it may be of &s;ervice to them. Again, it may in a particular manner be &s;erviceable to my poor kindred, the Indians. Further, as it comes from an un|common quarter, it may induce people to read it, becau&s;e it is from an Indian. La&s;tly, God works where and when he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and by what in&s;truments he &s;ees fit, and he can and has u&s;ed weak and unlikely in&s;truments to bring about his great work.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was a &s;tormy and very uncomfortable day, when the fol|lowing di&s;cour&s;e was delivered, and about one half of it was not delivered, as it was written, and now it is a little altered and enlarged in &s;ome places.</HI></P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>BY the melancholy providence of God, and at the ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire and invitation of the poor condemned cri|minal, I am here before this great concour&s;e of people at this time, to give the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e to the poor mi&s;erable object who is to be executed this day before your eyes, for the due reward of his folly and madne&s;s, and enormous wickedne&s;s. It is an unwelcome ta&s;k to me to &s;peak upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion; but &s;ince it is the de&s;ire of the poor man him&s;elf, who is to die a &s;hameful death this day, in con|&s;cience I cannot deny him; I mu&s;t endeavour to do the great work the dying man reque&s;ts.</P>
<P>I conclude that this great concour&s;e of people have come together to &s;ee the execution of ju&s;tice upon this poor In|dian; and I &s;uppo&s;e the bige&s;t part of you look upon your|&s;elves chri&s;tians, and as &s;uch I hope you will demean your|&s;elves; and that you will have &s;uitable commi&s;eration to|wards this poor object. Tho' you can't in ju&s;tice pray for his life to be continued in this world, yet you can pray ear|ne&s;tly for the &s;alvation of his poor &s;oul, con&s;i&s;tently with the mind of God. Let this be therefore, the fervent exerci&s;e of our &s;ouls: for this is the la&s;t day we have to pray for him. As for you, that don't regard religion, it cannot be expected, that you will put up one petition for this mi&s;erable creature: yet I would intreat you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the frailty of corrupt nature, and behave your&s;elves as becomes rational creatures.</P>
<P>And in a word, let us all be &s;uitably affected with the melancholy occa&s;ion of the day, knowing that we are all dy|ing creatures, and accountable unto God. Tho' this poor condemned criminal will in a few minutes know more than all of us, either in unutterable joy, or in inconceivable wo, yet we &s;hall certainly know as much as he, in a few days.</P>

<HEAD>The &s;acred words that I have cho&s;en to &s;peak from upon this unde&s;irable occa&s;ion, are found written in the epi&s;tle of St. Paul to the</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ROMANS VI. 23.</BIBL>
<Q>For the wages of &s;in is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DEATH is called the King of Terrors, and it ought to be the &s;ubject of every man and wo|man's thoughts daily; becau&s;e it is that unto which they are liable every moment of their lives: and therefore, it cannot be un&s;ea&s;on|able to think, &s;peak and hear of it at any time, and e&s;peci|ally on this mournful occa&s;ion; for we mu&s;t all come to it, how &s;oon we cannot tell; whether we are prepared or not prepared, ready or not ready, whether death is welcome or not welcome, we mu&s;t feel the force of it: whether we con|cern our&s;elves with death or not, it will concern it&s;elf with us. Seeing that this is the ca&s;e with every one of us, what man|ner of per&s;ons ought we to be in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s; how ought men to exert them&s;elves in prepara|tion for death continually; for they know not what a day or an hour may bring forth, with re&s;pect to them. But, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> according to the appearance of mankind in general,
<PB N="6" REF="012494_0004_0F8A901D938350C8">
death is the lea&s;t thought of. They go on from day to day, as if they were to live here forever, as if this was the only life. They contrive, rack their inventions, di&s;turb their re&s;t, and even hazard their lives in all manner of dangers, both by &s;ea and land; yea they leave no &s;tone unturn'd that they may live in the world, and at the &s;ame time have little or no contrivance to die well: God and their &s;ouls are neglected, and heaven and eternal happine&s;s are di&s;regard|ed; Chri&s;t and his religion are de&s;pi&s;ed&mdash;yet mo&s;t of the&s;e very men intend to be happy when they come to die, not con&s;idering that there mu&s;t be great preparation in order to die well. Yea there is none &s;o fit to live as tho&s;e that are fit to die; tho&s;e that are not fit to die are not fit to live. Life &amp; death are nearly connected; we generally own that it is a great and &s;olemn thing to die. If this be true, then it is a great and &s;olemn thing to live; for as we live, &s;o we &s;hall die. But I &s;ay again, how little do mankind realize the&s;e things? They are bu&s;y about the things of this world as if there was no death before them. Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> pictures them out to the life in his p&s;alms:
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>See the vain race of mortals move</HI></L>
<L><HI>Like &s;hadows o'er the plain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>They rage and &s;trive, de&s;ire and love,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But all the noi&s;e is vain.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Some walk in honor's gaudy &s;how,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Some dig for golden ore,</HI></L>
<L><HI>They toil for heirs they know not who,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And &s;trait are &s;een no more.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>But on the other hand, life is the mo&s;t precious thing and ought to be the mo&s;t de&s;ired by all rational creatures. It ought to be prized above all things; yet there is nothing &s;o abu&s;ed and de&s;pi&s;ed as life, and nothing &s;o neglected: mean eternal life is &s;hamefully di&s;regarded by men in gene|ral, and eternal death is cho&s;en rather than life. This
<PB N="7" REF="012494_0004_0F8A901D938350C8">
the general complaint of the bible from the beginning to the end. As long as Chri&s;t is neglected, life is refu&s;ed, and as long as &s;in is cheri&s;hed, death is cho&s;en; and this &s;eems to be the woful ca&s;e of mankind of all nations, accor|ding to their appearance in the&s;e days; for it is too plain to be denied, that vice and immorality, and floods of ini|quity are abounding every where among&s;t all nations, and all orders and ranks of men, and in every &s;ect of people. Yea there is a great agreement and harmony among all na|tions, and from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t to practi&s;e &s;in and iniquity; and the pure religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is turned out of doors, and is dying without; or, in other words, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is turned out of doors by men in ge|neral, and even by his profe&s;&s;ed people. "He came to his own, and his own received him not." But the devil is ad|mitted, he has free acce&s;s to the hou&s;es and hearts of the children of men: Thus life is refu&s;ed and death is cho&s;en. But in further &s;peaking upon our text, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ce, I &s;hall con&s;ider the&s;e two general propo&s;itions:</P>
<P>I. That &s;in is the cau&s;e of all the mi&s;eries that befal the children of men, both as to their bodies and &s;ouls, for time and eternity.</P>
<P>II. That eternal life and happine&s;s is the free gift of God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking to the fir&s;t propo&s;ition I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the nature of &s;in; and &s;econdly &s;hall con&s;ider the con&s;e|quences of &s;in, or the wages of &s;in, which is death.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, we are to de&s;cribe the nature of &s;in.</P>
<P>Sin is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law:&mdash;This is the &s;cripture definition of &s;in. Now the law of God being holy, ju&s;t and good; &s;in mu&s;t be altogether unholy, unju&s;t and evil. If I was define &s;in, I &s;hould call it a contrariety to GOD; and as &s;uch mu&s;t be the vile&s;t thing in the world; it is full of all evil; it is
<PB N="8" REF="012494_0005_0F8A901E53C11930">
the evil of evils; the only evil, in which dwells no good thing; and is mo&s;t de&s;tructive to God's creation, where ever it takes effect. It was &s;in that transformed the very angels in heaven, into devils; and it was &s;in that cau&s;ed hell to be made. If it had not been for &s;in, there never would have been &s;uch a thing as hell or devil, death or mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>And if &s;in is &s;uch a thing as we have ju&s;t de&s;cribed; it mu&s;t be wor&s;e than the devils and hell it&s;elf.&mdash;Sin is full of deadly poi&s;on; it is full of malignity and hatred again&s;t God, again&s;t all his divine perfections and atributes, again&s;t his wi&s;dom, again&s;t his power, again&s;t his holine&s;s and goodne&s;s again&s;t his mercy and ju&s;tice, again&s;t his written law and go&s;pel; yea, again&s;t his very being and exi&s;tence. Were it in the power of &s;in, it would even dethrone God, and &s;et it|&s;elf on the throne.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;t the Son of the Mo&s;t High, came down from the glorious world above, into this wretched world of &s;in and &s;orrow, to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t, &s;in, or &s;inners ro&s;e up again&s;t him, as &s;oon as he entered our world, and pur&s;ued him with helli&s;h malice, night and day, for above thirty years together, till they kill'd him.</P>
<P>Further, &s;in is again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; it oppo&s;es all his good and holy operations upon the children of me. When, and wherever there is the out-pouring of the Spin of God, upon the children of men, in a way of conviction and conver&s;ion; &s;in will immediately prompt the devil and his children to ri&s;e up again&s;t it, and they will oppo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> work with all their power, and in every &s;hape. And if open oppo&s;ition will not do, the devil will mimick the work, and thus prevent the good effect.</P>
<P>Thus we find by the &s;cripture accounts, that whenever God rai&s;es up men, and u&s;es them as in&s;truments of convic|tion and conver&s;ion, the devil and his in&s;truments will rise up to de&s;troy both the reformers and the reformed. That it has been from the early days of Chri&s;tianity, to this day
<PB N="9" REF="012494_0005_0F8A901E53C11930">
We have found it &s;o in our day. In the time of the out|pouring of the Spirit of God in the&s;e colonies, to the con|viction and reformation of many; immediately &s;in and the devil influenced numbers to ri&s;e up again&s;t the good work of God, calling it delu&s;ion, and work of the devil. And thus &s;in al&s;o oppo&s;es every motion of the Spirit of God, in the heart of every Chri&s;tian; this makes a warfare in the &s;oul.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew the &s;ad con&s;equences or ef|fects of &s;in upon the children of men.</P>
<P>Sin has poi&s;on'd them, &amp; made them di&s;tracted or fools. The P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, The fool hath &s;aid in his heart, there is no God. And Solomon, thro' his Proverbs, calls ungodly &s;inners fools; and their &s;in he calls their folly, and fooli&s;hne&s;s. The Apo&s;tle James &s;ays, But the tongue can no man tame, it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poi&s;on. It is the heart that is in the fir&s;t place full of deadly poi&s;on. The tongue is only an in|terpreter of the heart. Sin has viriated the whole man, both &s;oul and body; all the powers are corrupted; it has turned the minds of men again&s;t all good, towards all evil. So poi&s;oned are they, according to the prophet I&s;aiah v. ch. 20 ver. "Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil&punc; that put darkne&s;s for light, and light for darkne&s;s; that put bitter for &s;weet, and &s;weet for bitter." And Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;aith in John iii. 19, 20. "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved." Sin has &s;tupified mankind, they are now ignorant of God their maker; nei|ther do they enquire after him. And they are ignorant of them&s;elves, they know not what is good for them, neither do they under&s;tand their danger; and they have no fear of God before their eyes.</P>
<P>Further, &s;in has blinded their eyes, &s;o that they can't di&s;|cern
<PB N="10" REF="012494_0006_0F8A901F1B8DA660">
&s;piritual things; neither do they &s;ee the way that they &s;hould go, and they are deaf as adders, &s;o that they cannot hear the joyful &s;ound of the go&s;pel that brings glad tidings of peace and pardon to &s;inners of mankind. Neither do they regard the Charmer charming never &s;o wi&s;ely.&mdash;Not only &s;o, but &s;in has made man proud, tho' he has nothing to be proud of; for he has lo&s;t all his excellency, his beauty and happine&s;s; he is a bankrupt, and is excommunicated from God; he was turned out of paradi&s;e by God him&s;elf, and become a vagabond in God's world, and as &s;uch he has no right nor title to the lea&s;t crumb of mercy in the world: yet he is proud, he is haughty, and exalts him&s;elf above God, tho' he is wretched and mi&s;erable, and poor, and blind and naked. He glories in his &s;hame. Sin has made him bea&s;tly and devili&s;h; yea he is &s;unk beneath the bea&s;ts, and is wor&s;e than the ravenous bea&s;ts, of the wilderne&s;s. He is become ill-natur'd, cruel and murderous; he is con|tentious and quarrel&s;ome. I &s;aid he is wor&s;e than the ra|venous bea&s;ts, for wolves and bears don't devour their own kind, but man does; yea we have numberle&s;s in&s;tances of women killing their own children; &s;uch women I think are wor&s;e than &s;he tygers.</P>
<P>Sin has made men di&s;hone&s;t and deceitful, &s;o that he goes about cheating and defrauding and deceiving his fellow men in the world: yea, he is become a cheat him&s;elf, he goes about in a vain &s;hew; we don't know where to find man. Some times we find as an angel of God; and at other times we find as a devil, even one and the &s;ame man. Sin has made man a liar even from the womb; &s;o that there is no believing nor tru&s;ting him. The royal p&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, "The wicked are e&s;tranged from the womb, they go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they are born, &s;peaking lies."&mdash;His language is al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> he had a pure and holy language, in his innocency, to adore and prai&s;e God his maker, he now cur|&s;es, &s;wears, and profanes the holy name of God, and cur&s;es
<PB N="11" REF="012494_0006_0F8A901F1B8DA660">
and damns his fellow-creatutes. In a word, man is a mo&s;t unruly and ungovernable creature, and is become as the wild a&s;s's colt, and is harder to tame than any of God's creatures in this world. In &s;hort, man is wor&s;e than all creatures in this lower world, his propen&s;ity is to evil and that continually; he is more like the devil than any crea|ture we can think of: and I think it is not going beyond the word of God, to &s;ay, man is the mo&s;t devili&s;h creature in the world. Chri&s;t &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, One of you is a devil; to the Jews he &s;aid, Ye are of your father the devil, and the lu&s;ts of your father ye will do. Thus every un|converted &s;oul is a child of the devil, &s;in has made them &s;o.</P>
<P>We have given &s;ome few hints of the nature of &s;in, and the effects of &s;in on mankind.</P>
<P>We &s;hall in the next place con&s;ider the wages or the re|ward of &s;in, which is death.</P>
<P>Sin is the cau&s;e of all the mi&s;eries that attend poor &s;inful man, which will finally bring him to death, death tempo|ral and eternal. I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider his temporal death.</P>
<P>His temporal death then begins as &s;oon as he is born. Tho' it &s;eems to us that he is ju&s;t beginning to live, yet in fact he is ju&s;t entered into a &s;tate of death: as St. Paul &s;ays, "Wherefore, as by one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in; and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned. Man is &s;urrounded with ten thou&s;and in&s;truments of death, and is liable to death every moment of his life; a thou&s;and di&s;ea&s;es await him on every &s;ide continually; the &s;entence of death is pa&s;t upon them as &s;oon as they are born: yea they are &s;truck with death as &s;oon as they breathe. And it &s;eems all the enjoyments of men in this world are al&s;o poi&s;oned with &s;in: for GOD &s;aid to Adam after he had &s;inned, "Cur&s;ed is the ground for thy &s;ake, in &s;orrow &s;halt thou eat of it all the days of thy life." By this we plainly &s;ee that every thing that grows out of the ground is cur&s;ed, and all creatures that God hath made for man
<PB N="12" REF="012494_0007_0F8A901FCF953648">
are cur&s;ed al&s;o; and whatever God cur&s;es is a cur&s;ed thing indeed. Thus death and de&s;truction is in all the enjoyments of men in this life, every enjoyment in this world is liable to misfortune in a thou&s;and ways, both by &s;ea and land.</P>
<P>How many &s;hips, that have been loaded with the choice&s;t trea&s;ures of the earth, have been &s;wallowed up in the ocean, many times ju&s;t before they enter their de&s;ired haven. And va&s;t trea&s;ures have been con&s;umed by fire on the land, &amp;c. And the fruits of the earth are liable to many judg|ments. And the deare&s;t and neare&s;t enjoyments of men are generally balanced with equal &s;orrow and grief. A man and his wife who have liv'd together in happine&s;s for many years; that have comforted each other in various changes of life, mu&s;t at la&s;t be &s;eperated; one or the other mu&s;t be taken away fir&s;t by death, and then the poor &s;urvivor is drowned in tears, in &s;orrow, mourning and grief. And when a dear child or children are taken away by death the bereaved parents are bowed down with &s;orrow and deep mourning. When Jo&s;eph was &s;old by his brethren unto the I&s;hmaelites, they took his coat and rolled it in blood, and car|ried it to their father, and the good patriarch knew it to be Jo&s;eph's coat, and he concluded that his dear Jo&s;eph was devoured by evil bea&s;ts, and he was plunged all over in &s;orrow and bitter mourning, and he refu&s;ed to be com|forted. And &s;o when tender parents are taken away by death, the children are left comfortle&s;s.&mdash;All this is the &s;ad effect of &s;in.&mdash;The&s;e are the wages of &s;in.</P>
<P>And &s;econdly, we are to con&s;ider man's &s;piritual death, while he is here in this world. We find it thus written in the word of God. 'And the Lord God commanded the man, &s;aying, of every tree of the garden thou maye&s;t freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge, of good and evil, thou &s;halt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die.' And yet he did eat of it, and &s;o he and all his po&s;terity, are but dead men. And St. Paul to
<PB N="13" REF="012494_0007_0F8A901FCF953648">
the Ephe&s;ians &s;aith, 'You hath he quickened, who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.&mdash;The great Mr. Henry &s;ays in this place, that unregenerate &s;ouls are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins. All tho&s;e who are in their &s;ins, are dead in &s;ins; yea, in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; which may &s;ignify all &s;orts of &s;ins, ha|bitual and actual; &s;ins of heart and life. Sin is the death of the &s;oul. Wherever that prevails, there is a privation of all &s;piritual life. Sinners are dead in &s;tate, being de&s;titute of the principles and powers of &s;pirtual life; and cut off from God, the fountain of life: and they are dead in law, as a condemned malefactor is &s;aid to be a dead man. Now a dead man, in a natural &s;en&s;e, is unactive, and is of no &s;ervice to the living; there is no corre&s;pondence between the dead and the living: there is no agreement or union between them, no fellow&s;hip at all between the dead and the living. A dead man is altogether ignorant of the intercour&s;es a|mong&s;t the living:&mdash;ju&s;t &s;o it is with men that are &s;piritual|ly dead; they have no agreeable activity. Their activity in &s;in, is their deadne&s;s, and inactivity towards God. They are of no &s;ervice to God; and they have no corre&s;pondence with heaven; and there is no agreement or fellow&s;hip be|tween them and the living God; and they are totally igno|rant of the agreable and &s;weet intercour&s;e there is between God and his children here below: and they are ignorant, and know nothing of that ble&s;&s;ed fellow&s;hip and union there is among the &s;aints here below. They are ready to &s;ay in|deed, behold how they love one another! But they know nothing of that love, that the children of God enjoy. As &s;in is in oppo&s;ition to God; &s;o &s;inners are at enmity again&s;t God; there is no manner of agreement between them.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider further. God is a living God, he is all life, the fountain of life; and a &s;inner is a dead &s;oul; there is nothing but death in him. And now judge ye, what a|greement can there be between them? God is a holy and pure God, and a &s;inner is an unholy and filthy creature;&mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="012494_0008_0F8A9020A40E3980">
God is a righteous Being, and a &s;inner is an unrighteous crea|ture; God is light, and a &s;inner is darkne&s;s it&s;elf, &amp;c. Fur|ther, what agreement can there be between God and a lyar, a thief, a drunkard, a &s;wearer, a profane creature, a whore|monger, an adulterer, and idolater, &amp;c. No one that has any &s;en&s;e, dare &s;ay, that there is any agreement. Further, as &s;in|ners are dead to God, as &s;uch, they have no delight in God, and godline&s;s; they have no ta&s;te for the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; they have no plea&s;ure in the holy exerci&s;es of religi|on. Prayer is no plea&s;ant work with them; or if they have any plea&s;ure in it, it is not out of love to God, but out of &s;elf-love, like the Phari&s;ees of old; they loved to pray in open view of men, that they might have prai&s;e from them. And perhaps, they were not careful to pray in &s;ecret. The&s;e were dead &s;ouls, they were unholy, rotten hypocrites, and &s;o all their prayers and religious exerci&s;es were cold, dead, and abominable &s;ervices to God. Indeed they are dead to all the duties that God requires of them; they are dead to the holy bible; to all the laws, commands, and pre|cepts thereof; and to the ordinances of the go&s;pel of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. When they read the book of God, it is like an old almanack to them, a dead book. But it is be|cau&s;e they are dead, and as &s;uch, all their &s;ervices are again&s;t God, even their be&s;t &s;ervices are an abomination unto God; yea, a &s;inner is &s;o dead in &s;in, that the threatnings of God don't move them. All the thunderings and lightnings of Mount-Sinai don't &s;tir them. And all the cur&s;es of the law are out again&s;t them; yea, every time they read the&s;e cur&s;es in the bible, they are cur&s;ing them to their faces, and to their very eyes; yet they are unconcern'd, and go on in &s;in without fear. And la&s;tly here, &s;in has &s;o &s;tupify'd the &s;inner, that he will not believe his own &s;en&s;es; he wont believe his own eyes, nor his own ears; he reads the book of God, but he does not believe what he reads. And he hears of God, and heaven, and eternal happine&s;s, and of hell and eternal
<PB N="15" REF="012494_0008_0F8A9020A40E3980">
mi&s;ery; but he believes none of the&s;e things; he goes on, as if there were no God, nor heaven and happine&s;s; neither has he any fear of hell and eternal torments;&mdash;and he &s;ees his fellow men dropping away daily on every &s;ide, yet he goes on carele&s;sly in &s;in, as if he never was to die. And if he at any time thinks of dying, he hardly believes his own tho'ts. Death is at great di&s;tance, &s;o far off, that he don't concern him&s;elf about it, &s;o as to prepare for it. God mournfully complains of his people, that they don't con&s;ider; O that they were wi&s;e, that they under&s;tood this, that they would con&s;ider their latter end.</P>
<P>The next thing I &s;hall con&s;ider, is the actual death of the body, or &s;eperation between &s;oul and body. At the ce&s;&s;ation of natural life, there is an end of all the enjoyments of this life; there is no more joy nor &s;or|row; no more hope nor fear, as to the body; no more contrivance and carrying on any bu&s;ine&s;s; no more mer|chandizing and trading; no more farming; no more buy|ing and &s;elling; no more building of any kind, no more contrivance at all to live in the world; no more flatteries nor frowns from the world; no more honor nor re|proach; no more prai&s;e; no more good report, nor evil re|port; no more learning of any trades, arts or &s;ciences in the world; no more &s;inful plea&s;ures, they are all at an end; re|creations, vi&s;iting, tavern haunting, mu&s;ic and dancing, chambering and carou&s;ing, playing at dice and cards, or any game what&s;oever; cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, and profaning the holy name of God, drunkenne&s;s, fighting, debauchery, ly|ing and cheating, in this world, mu&s;t cea&s;e forever. Not only &s;o, but they mu&s;t bid an eternal farewel to all the world; bid farewel to all their beloved &s;ins and plea&s;ures; and the places and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that knew them once, &s;hall know them no more forever. And further, they mu&s;t bid adieu to all &s;acred and divine things. They are obliged to leave the bible, and all the ordinances thereof; and to bid farewel to
<PB N="16" REF="012494_0009_0F8A902155906E78">
preachers, and all &s;ermons and all chri&s;tian people, and chri&s;|tian conver&s;ation; they mu&s;t bid a long farewel to &s;abbaths and &s;ea&s;ons, and opportunities of wor&s;hip; yea, an eternal farewel to all mercy, and all hope; an eternal farewel to God the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, and adieu to hea|ven and all happine&s;s, to &s;aints and all the inhabitants of the upper world. At your lei&s;ure plea&s;e to read the de|&s;truction of Babylon; you will find it written in the 18th of the Revelation.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the poor departed &s;oul mu&s;t take up its lodging in &s;orrow, wo and mi&s;ery, in the lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched; where a multitude of frightful de|formed devils dwell, and the damned gho&s;ts of Adam's race; where darkne&s;s, horror and de&s;pair reigns, where hope never comes, and where poor guilty naked &s;ouls will be tormented with exqui&s;ite torments, even the wrath of the Almighty poured out-upon their damned &s;ouls; the &s;moke of their torments a&s;cending up forever and ever; their mouths and no&s;trils &s;treaming forth with living fire; and helli&s;h groans, howlings, cries and &s;hrieks all round them, and mercile&s;s devils upbraiding them for their folly and madne&s;s, and tormenting them ince&s;&s;antly.&mdash;And there they mu&s;t endure the mo&s;t un&s;atiable, fruitle&s;s de&s;ire, and the mo&s;t overwhelming &s;hame and confu&s;ion, and the mo&s;t horrible fear, and the mo&s;t doleful &s;orrow, and the mo&s;t racking de&s;pair. When they ca&s;t their flaming eyes to heaven, with Dives in torments, they behold an angry and frowning GOD, who&s;e eyes are as a flaming fire, and they are &s;truck with ten thou&s;and darts of pain; and the &s;ight of the happine&s;s of the &s;aints above, adds to their pains and aggravates their mi&s;ery. And when they reflect upon their pa&s;t folly and madne&s;s in neglecting the great &s;alvation in their day, it will pierce them with ten thou&s;and inconceiv|able torments; it will as it were enkindle their hell afre&s;h;
<PB N="17" REF="012494_0009_0F8A902155906E78">
and it will cau&s;e them to cur&s;e them&s;elves bitterly, and cur&s;e the day in which they were born, and cur&s;e their parents that were the in&s;truments of their being in the world; yea they will cur&s;e, bitterly cur&s;e and wi&s;h that very GOD that gave them their being, to be in the &s;ame condition with them in hell torments. This is what is called the &s;econd death, and it is the la&s;t death, and an eternal death to a guil|ty &s;oul.</P>
<P>And O eternity, eternity, eternity! Who can mea&s;ure it? Who can count the years thereof? Arithmetic mu&s;t fail, the thoughts of men and angels are drowned in it; how &s;hall we de&s;cribe eternity? To what &s;hall we compare it? Were it po&s;&s;ible to employ a fly to carry off this globe by the &s;mall particles thereof, and to carry them to &s;uch a di&s;|tance that it &s;hould return once in ten thou&s;and years for another particle, and &s;o continue till it has carried off all this globe, and framed them together in &s;ome unknown &s;pace, till it has made ju&s;t &s;uch a world as this is: after all eternity would remain the &s;ame unexhau&s;ted duration. This mu&s;t be the unavoidable portion of all impenitent &s;inners, let them be who they will, great or &s;mall, honorable or ignoble, rich or poor, bond or free. Negroes, Indians, Engli&s;h, or of what nations &s;oever, all that die in their &s;ins, mu&s;t go to hell together, for the wages of &s;in is death.</P>
<P>The next thing that I was to con&s;ider is this:</P>
<P>That eternal life and happine&s;s is the free gift of God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>Under this propo&s;ition I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew what this life and happine&s;s is.</P>
<P>The life that is mentioned in our text is, a &s;piritual life: it is the life of the &s;oul, a re&s;toration of &s;oul from &s;in, to ho|line&s;s, from darkne&s;s to light, a tran&s;lation from the king|dom and dominion of &s;atan, to the kingdom of God's grace. In other words, it is being re&s;tored to the image of God, and delivered from the image of &s;atan. And this life con|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="18" REF="012494_0010_0F8A90221D2D15F0">
in union of the &s;oul to God, and communion with God; a real participation of the divine nature, or in the a|po&s;tle's words, it is Chri&s;t formed within us; I live, &s;ays he, yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me. And the apo&s;tle John &s;aith, God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. This is the life of the &s;oul. It is called emphatically life, becau&s;e it is a life that &s;hall never have a period, a &s;table, permanent, and unchangeable life, called in the &s;criptures, everla&s;ting life, or life eternal. And the happine&s;s of this life con&s;i&s;ts in communion with God, or in the &s;piritual enjoyment of God. As much as a &s;oul enjoys of God in this life, ju&s;t &s;o much of life and happine&s;s he enjoys or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; yea, ju&s;t &s;o much of heaven he en|joys. A true chri&s;tian, de&s;ires no other heaven, but the en|joyment of God, a full and perfect enjoyment of God, is a full and perfect heaven and happine&s;s to a gracious &s;oul.&mdash;Further, this life is called eternal life, becau&s;e God has plant|ed a living principle in the &s;oul; and whereas he was dead before, now he is made alive unto God; there is an active principle within him towards God, he now moves towards God in his religious devotions and exerci&s;es; is daily comfortably and &s;weetly walking with God, in all his ordinances and com|mands; his delight is in the ways of God; he breathes towards God, a living breath, in prai&s;es, prayers, adorations and thank&s;givings; his prayers are now heard in the heavens, and his prai&s;es delight the ears of the Almighty, and his thank&s;|givings are accepted. So alive is he now to God, that it is his meat and drink, yea more than his meat and drink, to do the will of his heavenly Father. It is his delight, his happine&s;s and plea&s;ure to &s;erve God. He does not drag him&s;elf to his duties now, but he does them out of choice, and with alacrity of &s;oul. Yea, &s;o alive is he to God, that he gives up him&s;elf and all that he has entirely to God, to be for him and none other; his whole aim is to glorify God in all things, whether by life or death, all the &s;ame to him.</P>
<P>We have a bright example of this in St. Paul. After he
<PB N="19" REF="012494_0010_0F8A90221D2D15F0">
was converted, he was all alive to God; he regarded not his life, but was willing to &s;pend, and be &s;pent in the &s;ervice of his God; he was hated, revil'd, de&s;pi&s;ed, laughed at, and called by all manner of evil names; was &s;courged, &s;toned and impri&s;oned;&mdash;and all cou'd not &s;top his activity towards God. He would boldly and couragiou&s;ly go on in preach|ing the go&s;pel of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to poor, lo&s;t, and undone &s;inners; he would do the work God &s;et him about, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition he met with, either from men or devils, earth or hell; come death, or come life, none of the&s;e things moved him, becau&s;e he was alive unto God. Tho' he &s;uffered hunger and thir&s;t, cold and heat, poverty &amp; naked|ne&s;s by day &amp; by night, by &s;ea and land, &amp; was in danger all ways; yet he would &s;erve God amid&s;t all the&s;e dangers. Read his amazing account in 2 Cor. 11. 23 and on.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of marvellous love towards God, we have in Daniel. When there was a proclamation of prohibition, &s;ent by the king, to all his &s;ubjects, forbidding them to call upon their gods, for thirty days; which was done by envious men, that they might find occa&s;ion again&s;t Daniel the &s;er|vant of the Mo&s;t High God; yet he having the life of God in his &s;oul, regarded not the king's decree, but made his pe|titions to his God, as often as he u&s;ed to do, tho' death was threatned to the di&s;obedient. But he feared not the hell they had prepared; for it &s;eems, the den re&s;embled hell, and the lions repre&s;ented the devils. And when he was actually ca&s;t into the lion's den, the ravenous bea&s;ts become meek and innocent as lambs, before the prophet, becau&s;e he was alive unto God; the &s;pirit of the Mo&s;t High was in him, and the lions were afraid before him. Thus it was with Da|niel and Paul; they went thro' fire and water, as the com|mon &s;aying is, becau&s;e they had eternal life in their &s;ouls in eminent manner; and they regarded not this life, for the cau&s;e and glory of God. And thus it has been in all ages with true Chri&s;tians. Many of the fore-fathers of the Eng|lish,
<PB N="20" REF="012494_0011_0F8A9022DADF8440">
in this country, had this life, and are gone the &s;ame way, that the holy prophets and apo&s;tles went. Many of them went thro' all manner of &s;ufferings for God; and a great number of them are gone home to heaven, in chariots of fire. I have &s;een the place in London, called Smithfield, where numbers were burnt to death for the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And there is the &s;ame life in true chri&s;tians now in the&s;e days; and if there &s;hould per&s;ecutions ari&s;e in our day, I verily believe, true chri&s;tians would &s;uffer with the &s;ame &s;pirit and temper of mind, as tho&s;e did, who &s;uffered in days pa&s;t.&mdash;This is the life which our text &s;peaks of.</P>
<P>We proceed in the next place to &s;hew, that this life, which we have de&s;crib'd, is the free gift of God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>Sinners have forfeited all mercy into the hand of divine ju&s;tice, and have merited hell and damnation to them&s;elves; for the wages of &s;in is everla&s;ting death, but heaven and happine&s;s is a free gift; it comes by favour; and all me|rit is excluded: and e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that we are fallen &s;inful creatures, and there is nothing in us that can recommend us to the favour of God; and we can do no|thing that is agreeable and acceptable to God; and the mer|cies we enjoy in this life are altogether from the pure mercy of God; we are unequal to them. Good old Jacob cried out, under a &s;en&s;e of his unworthine&s;s, "I am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all thy mercies," and we have nothing to give unto God, if we e&s;&s;ay to give all the &s;ervice that we are capable of, we &s;hould give him nothing but what was his own, and when we give up our&s;elves unto God, both &s;oul and body, we give him nothing; for we were his before; he had right to do with us as he plea&s;ed, either to throw us into hell, or &s;ave us.&mdash;There is nothing that we can call our own, but our &s;ins; and who is he that dares to &s;ay, I expect to have hea|ven for my &s;ins? for our text &s;ays, that the wages of &s;in is death. If we are thus unequal and unworthy of the lea&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="012494_0011_0F8A9022DADF8440">
mercy in this life, how much more are we unworthy of eter|nal life? yet God can find it in his heart to give it. And it is altogether unmerited; it is a free gift to unde&s;erving and hell de&s;erving &s;inners of mankind: it is altogether of God's &s;overeign good plea&s;ure to give it. It is of free grace &amp; &s;overeign mercy, and from the unbounded goodne&s;s of God; he was &s;elf-moved to it. And it is &s;aid that this life is giv|en in and through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It could not be given in any other way, but in and through the death and &s;ufferings of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; Chri&s;t him&s;elf is the gift, and he is the chri&s;tian's life. "For God &s;o loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life." The word &s;ays further, "For by grace ye are &s;aved, thro' faith, and that not of your&s;elves, it is the gift of God." This is given thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord; it is Chri&s;t that purcha&s;ed it with his own blood; he prepared it with his divine and almighty power; and by the &s;ame power, and by the influence of his &s;pirit, he prepares us for it; and by his divine grace pre&s;erves us to it. In a word, he is all in all in our eternal &s;alvation; all this is the free gift of God.</P>

This is a call, a gracious call to you, poor Mo&s;es, under your pre&s;ent burdens and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. And Chri&s;t alone has a right to call &s;inners to him&s;elf. It would be pre&s;umption for a mighty angel to call a poor &s;inner in this manner; and were it po&s;&s;ible for you to apply to all God's creatures, they would with one voice tell you, that it was not in them to help you. Go to all the means of grace, they would prove mi&s;erable helps, without Chri&s;t him&s;elf. Yea, apply to all the mini|&s;ters of the go&s;pel in the world, they would all &s;ay, that it was not in them, but would only prove as indexes, to point out to you, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only &s;aviour of &s;inners of mankind. Yea, go to all the angels in heaven, they would do the &s;ame. Yea, go to God the Father him&s;elf, without Chri&s;t, he cou'd not help you, to &s;peak after the manner of men, he would al&s;o point to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &amp; &s;ay this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed, hear ye him. Thus you &s;ee, poor Mo&s;es, that there is none in heaven, or on the earth, that can help you, but Chri&s;t; he alone has power to &s;ave, and to give life.&mdash;God the eternal hath ap|pointed him, cho&s;e him, authorized, and fully commi&s;&s;ioned him to &s;ave &s;inners. He came down from heaven, into this lower world, and became as one of us, and &s;tood in our room. He was the &s;econd Adam. And as God demanded perfect obedience of the fir&s;t Adam; the &s;econd fulfil'd it; and as the fir&s;t &s;inned, and incurred the wrath and anger of God, the &s;econd endur'd it; he &s;uffered in our room. As he became &s;in for us, he was a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief; all our &s;tripes were laid upon him; yea, he was final|ly condemned, becau&s;e we were under condemnation; and at la&s;t was executed and put to death, for our &s;ins; was lift|ed up between the heaven and the earth, and was crucified on the accur&s;ed tree; his ble&s;&s;ed hands and feet were fa&s;ten|ed there;&mdash;there he died a &s;hameful and ignominious death&punc;
<PB N="25" REF="012494_0013_0F8A90244F110E40">
there he fini&s;hed the great work of our redemption: there his hearts blood was &s;hed for our clean&s;ing: there he fully &s;atisfied the divine ju&s;tice of God, for penitent, believing &s;inners, tho' they have been the chief of &s;inners.&mdash;O Mo&s;es! this is good news to you, in this la&s;t day of your life; here is a crucified Saviour at hand for your &s;ins; his ble&s;&s;ed hands are out-&s;tretched, all in a gore of blood for you. This is the only Saviour, an almighty Saviour, ju&s;t &s;uch as you &s;tand in infinite and peri&s;hing need of. O, poor Mo&s;es! hear the dying prayer of a gracious Saviour on the accur&s;ed tree,&mdash;Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. This was a prayer for his enemies and murderers; and it is for you, if you would only repent and believe in him. O why will you die eternally, poor Mo&s;es, &s;ince Chri&s;t has died for &s;inners? Why will you go to hell from beneath the bleed|ing Saviour as it were? This is the day of your execution, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it is the accepted time, it is the day of &s;alvation if you will now believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

This is the la&s;t day of &s;alvation with your &s;oul; you will be beyond the bounds of mercy in a few minutes more. O, what a joyful day would it be if you would now openly believe in and receive the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; it would be the beginning of heavenly days with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> poor &s;oul; in&s;tead of a melancholy day, it would be a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ding day to your &s;oul; it would cau&s;e the very angels

But if you will not accept of a Saviour &s;o freely offered to you in this la&s;t day of your life, you mu&s;t this very day bid farewel to God the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t, to heaven and all the &s;aints and angels that are there <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and you mu&s;t bid all the &s;aints in this lower world an eter|nal farewel, and even the whole world.

<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> We may plainly &s;ee, from what we have heard, and from the mi&s;erable object before us, into what a doleful condition &s;in has brought mankind, even into a &s;tate of death and mi&s;ery. We are by nature as certainly under &s;entence of death from God, as this mi&s;erable man is, by the ju&s;t de|termination of man; and we are all dying creatures, and we are, or ought to be, &s;en&s;ible of it; and this is the dread|ful fruit of &s;in. O! let us then fly from all appearance of &s;in; let us fight again&s;t it with all our might; let us repent and turn to our God, and believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that we may live forever; let us all prepare for death, for we know not how &s;oon, nor how &s;uddenly we may be called out of the world.</P>

Permit me in particular, reverend Gentlemen and fathers in I&s;rael, to &s;peak a few words to you, tho' I am well &s;en&s;i|ble that I need to be taught the fir&s;t principles of the ora|cles of God, by the lea&s;t of you.

<P>God has rai&s;ed you up, from among your brethren, and has qualified, and authorized you to do his great work; and you are the &s;ervants of the Mo&s;t High GOD, and mini&s;ters of the Lord Je&s;us the Son of the living God: you are Chri&s;t's amba&s;&s;adors; you are called Shep|herds, watchmen, over&s;eers, or bi&s;hops, and you are rulers of the temples of God, or of the a&s;&s;emblies of God's peo|ple; you are God's angels, and as &s;uch you have nothing to do but to wait upon God, and to do the work the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t your ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Ma&s;ter has &s;et you about, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> fearing the face of any man, nor &s;eeking to plea&s;e men, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> your Ma&s;ter.

<P>You &s;ee the woful con&s;equences of &s;in, by &s;eeing this our poor mi&s;erable country-man now before us, who is to die this day for his &s;ins and great wickedne&s;s. And it was the &s;in of drunkenne&s;s that has brought this de&s;truction and untimely death upon him. There is a dreadful wo de|nounced from the Almighty again&s;t drunkards, and it
<PB N="29" REF="012494_0015_0F8A9026E4EB9190">
this &s;in, this abominable, this bea&s;tly and accur&s;ed &s;in of drunkenne&s;s, that has &s;tript us of every de&s;irable comfort in this life; by this we are poor, mi&s;erable and wretched; by this &s;in we have no name nor credit in the world among po|lite nations; for this &s;in we are de&s;pi&s;ed in the world, and it is all right and ju&s;t, for we de&s;pi&s;e our&s;elves more; and if we don't regard our&s;elves, who will regard us? And it is for our &s;ins, and e&s;pecially for that accur&s;ed, that mo&s;t de|veli&s;h &s;in of drunkenne&s;s that we &s;uffer every day. For the love of &s;trong drink we &s;pend all that we have, and every thing we can get. By this &s;in we can't have comfortable hou&s;es, nor any thing comfortable in our hou&s;es; neither food nor raiment, nor decent uten&s;ils. We are obliged to put up any &s;ort of &s;helter ju&s;t to &s;creeh us from the &s;everity of the weather; and we go about with very mean, ragged and dirty cloathes, almo&s;t naked. And we are half &s;tarved, for mo&s;t of the time obliged to pick up any thing to eat.&mdash;And our poor children are &s;uffering every day for want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life; they are very often crying for want of food, and we have nothing to give them; and in the cold weather they are &s;hivering and crying, being pinched with cold.&mdash;All this is for the love of &s;trong drink. And this is not all the mi&s;ery and evil we bring on our&s;elves in this world; but when we are intoxicated with &s;trong drink, we drown our rational powers, by which we are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the brutal creation; we unman our&s;elves, and bring our&s;elves not only level with the bea&s;ts of the field, but &s;e|ven degrees beneath them; yea we bring our&s;elves level with the devils; I don't know but we make our&s;elves wor&s;e than the devils, for I never heard of drunken devils.</P>
<P>My poor kindred, do con&s;ider what a dreadful abomina|ble &s;in drunkenne&s;s is. God made us men, and we chu&s;e to be bea&s;ts and devils; God made us rational creatures, and we chu&s;e to be fools. Do con&s;ider further, and behold a drunkard, and &s;ee how he looks, when he has drowned
<PB N="30" REF="012494_0016_0F8A9028BB3F30C8">
as rea&s;on; how deformed and &s;hameful does he appear? He di&s;-figures every part of him, both &s;oul and body, which was made after the image of God. He appears with awful deformity, and his whole vi&s;age is di&s;-figured; if he attempts to &s;peak he cannot bring out his words di&s;tinct, &s;o as to be under&s;tood; if he walks he reals and &s;taggers to and fro, and tumbles down. And &s;ee how he behaves, he is now laughing, and then he is crying; he is &s;inging and the next minute he is mourning; and is all love to every one, and anon he is raging, &amp; for fighting, &amp; killing all before him, even the neare&s;t and the deare&s;t relations and friends: Yea nothing is too bad for a drunken man to do. He will do that, which he would not do for the world, in his right mind; he may lie with his own &s;i&s;ter or daughter as Lot did.</P>
<P>Further, when a per&s;on is drunk, he is ju&s;t good for no|thing in the world; he is of no &s;ervice to him&s;elf, to his fa|mily, to his neighbours, or his country; and how much more unfit is he in &s;erve God: yet he is ju&s;t fit for the &s;er|vice of the devil.</P>
<P>Again, a man in drunkenne&s;s is in all manner of danger he may be kill'd by his fellow-men, by wild bea&s;ts, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> tame bea&s;ts; he may fall into the fire, into the water, or into a ditch; or he may fall down as he walks along, and break his bones or his neck; he may cut him&s;elf with edge|tools.&mdash;Further, if he has any money or any thing valuable, he may loo&s;e it all, or may be robb'd, or he may make a fooli&s;h bargain, and be cheated out of all he has.</P>
<P>I believe you know the truth of what I have ju&s;t now &s;aid, many of you, by &s;ad experience; yet you will go on &s;till in your drunkenne&s;s. Tho' you have been cheated over and over again, and you have lo&s;t your &s;ub&s;tance by drunkenne&s;s, yet you will venture to go on in this mo&s;t de|&s;tructive &s;in. O fools when will ye be wi&s;e?&mdash;We all know the truth of what I have been &s;aying, by what we have &s;een and heard of drunken deaths. How many have been
<PB N="31" REF="012494_0016_0F8A9028BB3F30C8">
drowned in our rivers, and how many frozen to death in the winter &s;ea&s;ons! yet drunkards go on without fear and con|&s;ideration: alas, alas! What will become of all &s;uch drunk|ards? Without doubt they mu&s;t all go to hell, except they truly repent and turn to God. Drunkenne&s;s is &s;o common among&s;t us, that even our young men and young women are not a&s;hamed to get drunk. Our young men will get drunk as &s;oon as they will eat when they are hungry.&mdash;It is generally e&s;teemed among&s;t men, more abominable for a woman to be drunk, than a man; and yet there is nothing more common among&s;t us that female drunkards. Women ought to be more mode&s;t than men; the holy &s;criptures re|commend mode&s;ty to women in particular:&mdash;but drunken women have no mode&s;ty at all. It is more intolerable for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> woman to get drunk, if we con&s;ider further, that &s;he is in great danger of falling into the hands of the &s;ons of Belial, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> wicked men&punc; and being &s;hamefully treated by them.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but ob&s;erve, we find in &s;acred writ, a wo denounced again&s;t men, who put their bottles to their neighbours mouth to make them drunk, that they may &s;ee their nakedne&s;s: and no doubt there are &s;uch devili&s;h men now in our day, as there were in the days of old.</P>
<P>And to conclude, con&s;ider my poor kindred, you that are drunkards, into what a mi&s;erable condition you have brought your&s;elves. There is a dreadful wo thunder|ing again&s;t you every day, and the Lord &s;ays, That drunk|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>And now let me exhort you all to break off from your drunkenne&s;s, by a go&s;pel repentance, and believe on the Lord Je&s;us and you &s;hall be &s;aved. Take warning by this doleful &s;ight before us, and by all the dreadful judgments that have befallen poor drunkards. O let us all reform our lives, and live as becomes dying creatures, in time to come. Let us be per&s;uaded that we are accountable crea|tures to God, and we mu&s;t be called to an account in a few

Fight again&s;t all &s;ins, and e&s;pecially the &s;in that ea&s;ily be&s;ets you, and behave in time to come as becomes rational creatures; and above all things, re|ceive and believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and you &s;hall have eternal life; and when you come today your &s;ouls will be received into heaven, there to be with the Lord Je|&s;us in eternal happine&s;s, with all the &s;aints in glory; which, God of his infinite mercy grant, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
