<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Letters were publi&s;hed in France in <HI>1791.</HI> They contain a relation of events which are &s;aid to have taken place in that country in <HI>1782.</HI> Although the work is probably in &s;ome degree fictitious, and has every appear|ance of a novel, the reader may be a&s;&s;ured that it is, in a great mea&s;ure, founded upon facts. The author &s;eems to have had it in view to re|move many religious and other prejudices from the minds of the French people, and to &s;how that &s;everal in&s;titutions of the Roman Catholic reli|gion were, in their nature, injurious to national and individual happine&s;s. This he endeavours to do, by giving the hi&s;tory of &s;everal per&s;ons who were extremely unhappy in con&s;equence of the ab&s;urd laws and religious in&s;titutions of their country, and thereby convince his readers that a reformation was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of forbidding marriage to the clergy, and the in&s;titution of mona&s;teries, by which many per&s;ons were excluded from &s;ociety, are here &s;hown to be ab&s;urd and unnatural; and the time is anticipated when the prejudices of the people &s;hould be removed, and tho&s;e de&s;picable e&s;tabli&s;hments at an end.</P>
<P>On reading the title-page, the reader will find a part of it to be, "<HI>The Nece&s;&s;ary Divorce.</HI>" This has reference to an in&s;tance mentioned in the
<PB N="vi" REF="035743_0004_1006ABBC55AE56B8">
hi&s;tory, where it is thought to be &s;uitable and nece&s;&s;ary that a hu&s;band and wife &s;hould not only be &s;eparated, but even obtain a divorce, although they are per&s;ons of the &s;tricte&s;t virtue, and their conduct unimpeachable. This the Editor acknow|ledges to be a curious que&s;tion, which he would choo&s;e to leave to the deci&s;ion of the reader. But he will venture, for him&s;elf, to affirm, that the law of divorce granted by the French National A&s;&s;embly, can no more be ju&s;tified than that of Mo&s;es, and that they can urge no better rea&s;on to palliate their criminality than "the hardne&s;s of the people's hearts."</P>
<P>The unparalleled profligacy of manners this nation has manife&s;ted in the cour&s;e of the late revolution; their open and daring profe&s;&s;ions of athei&s;m, and trampling on every divine precept; but more e&s;pecially their wanton depredations on our commerce, and refu&s;ing to come to an amica|ble &s;ettlement of differences between the two na|tions, has filled the minds of Americans with an abhorrence of the French name. This has, in &s;ome in&s;tances, injured the &s;ucce&s;s of the work: But the Editor has, on the whole, received &s;uch ample encouragement, by &s;ub&s;criptions, that his fears of not &s;ucceeding in the publication, merely becau&s;e the author was a Frenchman, are entire|ly di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hing his countrymen and their po&s;terity a perpetual continuance of that portion of civil and religious liberty they have hitherto enjoyed, and at pre&s;ent experience&mdash;con&s;cious that the follow|ing work is calculated to &s;how the deformity of vice, and the beauty and advantages of virtue, the Editor cheerfully commits the publication to their candid peru&s;al.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER From the Tran&s;lator to ***** ******.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN you fir&s;t put Emilia de Varmont into my hands for my amusement, I was far from expecting that your favour would be productive of such serious consequences. On the first perusal of it my mind was sensibly affected with the interesting nature of the events it related. After communicating the substance of the history to several intimate friends, and finding their opinion of its merit accorded with mine, I was led, by an almost invincible impulse, to think of translating and publishing it, for the perusal of my countrymen at large. This, as I have informed you, would have been long ago accomplished, had I not been obliged, by a languishing state of health, to defer the undertaking.</P>
<P>By comparing the translation with the original you will find that I have taken several liberties. To the title-page I have made several additions, and instead of "Les Amours du Cur&eacute; Sevin," I have put, <HI>Me|moirs of Curate Sevin.</HI> Several names of persons which I supposed could not be pronounced by mere English readers, so as to have an agreeable sound, I have sup|plied by others, which I think may be pronounced with less difficulty.</P>
<P>As far as was consistent with a free translation, I have, through the whole work, with few exceptions&punc;
<PB N="viii" REF="035743_0006_1006ABC640534468">
endeavoured to render the exact sense of the original. In several instances I have given an idea similar, but not strictly the same. In one or two places I have had the extraordinary presumption of giving a mean|ing directly contrary to that of the author: but I have made no alteration that will so materially affect the merit of the work as the lustre that it will una|voidably lose by appearing through the medium of a translation.</P>
<P>In reviewing, as well as perusing the work, I have frequently, and with much pleasure, observed the very natural and striking contrast between the vicious and virtuous characters; such as Madame de Varmont and Madame Florival; young Varmont and Bovile; Mur|ville, who is an instance of libertinism, and Dolerval, his brother, who is a pattern of sensibility and virtue. The two sisters, Celina and Emilia de Varmont, are, upon the whole, two excellent patterns of religious life and virtuous conduct, though not free from the prejudices of education, and the little errors and fail|ings inseparable from human nature. As they are victims of misfortune, in consequence of the cruel customs of their country, by which a hard-hearted mother exercised over them an undue authority, their history will afford an instructive lesson to our youth: for it will show them, by comparison, the salutary nature of the laws of their country, the superior ad|vantages we enjoy for national and private happiness, and may teach them to prize, as they ought, those in|estimable blessings.</P>
<P>In the letters of Murville, you must be sensible, are some expressions which could not, consistently with our notions of decency, be admitted in the trans|lation. Some of these I have totally expunged from the work; others I have so modified as to render them less exceptionable.</P>
<P>From what I have here mentioned, it seems natural to remark the great difference between the sentiments
<PB N="ix" REF="035743_0007_1006ABCAB18F2628">
of different nations respecting matters of decency. I would not be understood to have any reference to the unpolished part of any country; for we know that in all countries there are some low characters, who, in open violation of all established rules of decorum, will make no scruple of using language which the more refined part of the community would esteem highly indecent; but I would refer to the most polish|ed part of a nation, by whose writings and conversa|tion we may form an opinion of their prevailing taste. If we look into ancient authors, who were doubtless as virtuous as the moderns, we there find many ex|pressions, which, if used by the writers of the present day, would bring on them the contempt of every reader; and yet those very authors, owing to the great difference of manners between the former and latter ages, could make use of those expressions without any impeachment of their characters. In the scrip|tures of the Old Testament, which you have doubt|less read in our language, every subject is treated of with the greatest plainness: nor was there any need of reserve at a time when every subject might be spoken of without giving the least offence. Amongst all na|tions where civilization has extended its sway, per|haps there are none more scrupulous in these respects than the English and Americans. Perhaps France, your native country, considering the advantages she has enjoyed, has felt the effects of civilization as ma|terially as any nation in Europe; and yet, in the in|stances before mentioned, we can discover in the con|versation of the French people, almost as great sim|plicity as prevailed in ancient times. From what has already been said, which is much more than I at first intended, I would infer, that although we ought al|ways to have in our writings a sacred regard to the prevailing taste of our country, and avoid everything which excites impure sentiments, we ought not to conclude that other nations are less virtuous than we,
<PB N="x" REF="035743_0008_1006ABCCAF5D7148">
because they exercise more freedom in their expres|sions.</P>
<P>Through every preceding age, the friends of huma|nity have had to deplore the perverseness of human nature, which has been the occasion of bloody and innumerable wars between different nations. These wars, which have been caused by the clashing interests of neighbouring powers, have brought on the dread|ful necessity of inspiring the individuals of each con|tending nation with mutual hatred; we also, even in this enlightened age, have to lament that this frightful policy is still prevalent. Out of numerous instances which might be given, there are none more remarka|ble than those of England and France. It is well known to you, that it has often been the practice of the two different courts, while France was a monar|chy, to teach their subjects that the opposite court and their subjects formed a nation of brutes. And not|withstanding the late friendly disposition which the people of the United States exercised towards France, it has also become fashionable amongst us, since we have received so many injuries by the detestable policy of the French Directory, to stile the French a nation of barbarians. Although it is probable that the late extraordinary war which France has had to sustain against internal and external foes, may have rendered the French people more so than at any period since Europe has been civilized, I am far from believing that the term will universally apply. The one to whom I am now writing, with whom I am proud to be acquainted, whose mind is richly fraught with all the knowledge necessary to render him an agreeable companion, and a valuable citizen, can evince to the world the absurdity of such an opinion. For myself, I am always best pleased with those who entertain as favourable an opinion as possible of nations as well as individuals. Tins disposition inclines me to believe there are many worthy charters in every nation;
<PB N="xi" REF="035743_0009_1006ABCFC2C3E6A8">
and that, in all countries, human nature is much the same, allowing for the difference of climate, modes of living, and prejudices of education.</P>
<P>Lamenting with you the wretched degeneracy of the French nation&mdash;a degeneracy which is the una|voidable consequence of war and civil commotions, I cannot leave you without expressing my warmest wishes that France may soon be restored to peace and good government. Of this, however, there is no pro|mising appearance. Whilst many are expecting that the war will continue till Europe has reverted to her former state of barbarism, and others are looking for a more extensive civilization, it seems fruitless to ha|zard an opinion: for the great events which have fol|lowed each other in such rapid succession, since the revolution, have often baffled the prophetic skill of men who have formed their conjectures, on passing events, from the history of former ages.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE probability that the following let|ters may fall into the hands of &s;ome readers, who may not under&s;tand many al|lu&s;ions to the ceremonies and in&s;titutions of the Roman Catholic Religion, induces the American Editor to prefix a few &s;ketches to the work, to render it more intelligible.</P>
<P>In the early ages of Chri&s;tianity, after it had &s;pread its benign influence, and be|come, in a great degree, prevalent in almo&s;t every nation on the ea&s;tern continent, it gradually lo&s;t ground, and its happy effects were greatly dimini&s;hed, by rea&s;on of the wickedne&s;s and lukewarmne&s;s of many of its profe&s;&s;ed votaries; and the churches were rent with here&s;ies, and torn a&s;under by head&s;trong, contending parties.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of things, the Roman go|vernment, who&s;e conque&s;ts and power had been coexten&s;ive with the world, undertook to connect the Chri&s;tian religion with the civil power, and mold it to a &s;y&s;tem of &s;tate policy. The better to effect this purpo&s;e,
<PB N="xiv" REF="035743_0011_1006ABD741020E80">
it became nece&s;&s;ary to mingle the Chri&s;tian, Jewi&s;h and Pagan religions together. The temples of the Heathen deities were con|verted into churches; the images of tho&s;e deities, &s;uch as Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mi|nerva, &amp;c. were taken away, and replaced with images of &s;aints, male and female. The pure doctrines of the go&s;pel were clouded with a multitude of &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies, by which its original &s;implicity was almo&s;t &s;ubverted. The mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, who before this time had been in an hum|ble &s;tation, and, like Je&s;us Chri&s;t, their great Ma&s;ter, of a meek di&s;po&s;ition; like him, never interfering nor meddling with civil government, any farther than practi&s;ing, en|joining and enforcing obedience to it, were many of them, at this time, advanced to high offices in church and &s;tate, and inve&s;ted with great wealth and civil power; whil&s;t lower orders of the clergy were nearly as in|digent as the common people: All of them, however, acting under the authority of the Roman Emperor, called the Pope, who a&s;&s;umed the title of &s;upreme head of the church, and exerci&s;ed complete and un|controuled authority over all orders and ranks of men, both in a civil and eccle&s;ia&s;|tical capacity. Every po&s;&s;ible method was taken to throw all the wealth of the peo|ple into the hands of the church and &s;tate.
<PB N="xv" REF="035743_0012_1006ABDA4BCEDF78">
The prie&s;ts had the pretended power of for|giving &s;ins, and, by their prayers, relea&s;ing the &s;ouls of wicked men from purgatory; for which they obtained frequent and &s;ome|times large &s;ums of money from the people. Religious hou&s;es of men and women were e&s;tabli&s;hed, called by the different names of abbies, cloi&s;ters, convents, or mona&s;te|ries. To the&s;e hou&s;es multitudes have re|paired in every age of the Roman Catholic church, be&s;towed their fortunes on the&s;e in&s;titutions, or ca&s;t them into the bo&s;om of the church for charitable u&s;es, took a vow of living &s;ingle through life, and &s;pent their days in this retirement. This they have been per&s;uaded to do, &s;ometimes for the purpo&s;e of atoning for heinous crimes, or gaining, by their piety, extraordinary merit in the &s;ight of God, to entitle them to a better place in heaven. The better to effect the&s;e de&s;igns, the people were kept in great ignorance; prayers were made in an unknown tongue; the common people were not permitted to read the &s;criptures; all the decrees of the church and declara|tions of the clergy were deemed infallible.</P>
<P>Thus the pure, benign, and heaven-born light of true religion was greatly ob&s;cured; and the true church, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall number of faithful and enlightened follow|ers, like a forlorn, though beautiful and
<PB N="xvi" REF="035743_0013_1006ABDC146FB468">
cha&s;te, female pilgrim, was con&s;trained to wander here and there, without any re&s;ting place, to e&s;cape the defilement and per&s;e|cution of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny. It would require many and large volumes to enume|rate the many in&s;tances of &s;ocieties and in|dividuals, who, in every age of this dread|ful u&s;urpation, nobly defended the cau&s;e of true and uncorrupted religion, and who, by the intolerant &s;pirit of this corrupted church, were per&s;ecuted and &s;lain becau&s;e they would not adhere to its anti-chri&s;tian principles.</P>
<P>Millions &s;ucceeding millions have been mangled and tortured to death by this MO|THER of ABOMINATIONS, becau&s;e they would not &s;ub&s;cribe to principles which they viewed with abhorrence, (the embrac|ing of which they believed would expo&s;e them to everla&s;ting mi&s;ery in a future world) and renounce tho&s;e on which they founded their hopes of eternal felicity. Candour obliges me, as a prote&s;tant, to acknowledge that this &s;pirit of intolerance is not peculiar to the Romi&s;h church alone; nor would I affirm that it is any article of that religion to butcher the heretics. Every different &s;ect of prote&s;tants which have ari&s;en &s;ince the reformation, have di&s;covered a degree of the &s;ame &s;pirit: every one, in their turn, have accu&s;ed the other of popery, and per|&s;ecuted
<PB N="xvii" REF="035743_0014_1006ABE3329088C8">
each other, at lea&s;t with &s;entiments of hatred, if not with fire and &s;word. In this particular, every candid prote&s;tant will allow that we have all had a little popery. This principle of per&s;ecuting another for a difference of opinion, whether in politics or religion, when it actuates a body of men, and is blown up into a flame by &s;ome ambi|tious and unprincipled demagogue, will always lead them to per&s;ecute or de&s;troy tho&s;e who think differently from them&s;elves. The enemies of all religion have often urg|ed this as an unan&s;werable argument again&s;t the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. But &s;urely nothing can be more unju&s;t. We might as well ar|gue that riches and health, which in their own nature are the greate&s;t of all temporal ble&s;&s;ings, are in them&s;elves a cur&s;e, becau&s;e &s;ome men pervert them to the vile&s;t of pur|po&s;es: or we might join with tho&s;e mi&s;|taken politicians who would a&s;&s;ert, that ra|tional liberty is not a ble&s;&s;ing to any people, becau&s;e the modern government of France has di&s;graced the name of it by embracing a &s;y&s;tem of tyranny, and, under the ma&s;k of re|publicani&s;m, committed the mo&s;t enormous crimes. The fact is, that &s;uch is the way|ward di&s;po&s;ition of man, that every faculty of body or mind, every peculiar ble&s;&s;ing or acquirement, is often, by a mi&s;improvement of it, rendered a cur&s;e in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="035743_0015_1006ABEBC54E90F8">The limits pre&s;cribed me, will not admit of enlarging on this &s;ubject. It mu&s;t &s;uffice me to &s;ay, that it required &s;everal ages for this corrupt &s;y&s;tem to arrive to its highe&s;t &s;tate, and that, &s;ince the reformation in Eu|rope, its influence and power have been gra|dually decrea&s;ing; and although in &s;everal nations, its influence in &s;entiment is yet con&s;iderable, the power of the Pope, as a political prince, &s;eems to be annihilated.</P>
<P>The convents are large, &s;trong and &s;pa|cious buildings, &s;ome of which, with nu|merous apartments and grates to the win|dows, have almo&s;t every appearance of a pri&s;on. Adjoining the&s;e buildings are large gardens, &s;urrounded with &s;trong and high walls, e&s;pecially tho&s;e appointed for women. On the top of the&s;e walls are pieces of gla&s;s, or other &s;harp &s;ub&s;tances, fa&s;tened into them, &s;o that no per&s;on can get over them but with difficulty. In the front of the&s;e build|ings is a large hall, called the parlour of the convent. To this numbers of the reli|gious belonging to the cloi&s;ters, &s;ometimes repair for conver&s;ation. And when a father or brother wi&s;hes to &s;ee a daughter or &s;i&s;ter who has become a nun, they go into the parlour, where they can &s;ee and conver&s;e with her through the grates of the windows. Some are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of royal convents. The&s;e are buildings of
<PB N="xix" REF="035743_0016_1006ABF0593C05A0">
the noble&s;t &s;tructure, and have all the ex|ternal beauties of a palace. The royal con|vents, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Abbies, are &s;upported by government. They are e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;upport of young gentlemen and ladies who are de|&s;cended from the nobility, and who&s;e for|tunes are &s;o &s;mall that they cannot live in the world in a &s;plendor &s;uitable to their rank.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who are intended to lead the mona&s;tic life, remain in the&s;e hou&s;es for a con&s;iderable time, in a &s;ort of probation, called the novitiate. The term of the no|vitiate is a year, but it may be lengthened at the plea&s;ure of the candidate or director of the convent. It is required of both &s;exes to be uniform in their dre&s;s. The uniform of different mona&s;teries is various: For in|&s;tance, &s;ome orders of nuns wear a white dre&s;s, with dark coloured veils; others a black dre&s;s, with veils of a different colour. The veil is formed of a long &s;trip of gauze, or &s;ome other thin &s;tuff, which comes over and below the face to a con&s;iderable length. The ceremonies at the time of taking the vow are performed with great &s;olemnity. One of them is, that after the woman has taken the vow of perpetual celibacy, and &s;olemnly dedicated her&s;elf to God and a life of religion, &s;he lies pro&s;trate before the altar
<PB N="xx" REF="035743_0017_1006ABF4AEBD8F98">
for &s;everal minutes, and is covered with a pall, to make the ceremony re&s;emble a fu|neral, and &s;ignify that &s;he is dead to the world. The women, at the time of taking the veil, cut off a part of their hair, and put upon their heads a &s;ort of bonnet or cap, to which they fa&s;ten the veil, which they mu&s;t wear to the end of their lives, and is to be con&s;idered as a badge of their profe&s;|&s;ion. When a woman has once taken the veil, &s;he can never go beyond the walls of the convent or adjacent gardens; nor can &s;he, e&s;pecially if &s;he belongs to the &s;tricter orders, ever &s;ee any man, not even the neare&s;t relation, be&s;ides the prie&s;t and phy|&s;ician, except through the grates. She may, however, be removed from the convent to which &s;he belongs to another of the &s;ame order, if &s;he is di&s;plea&s;ed with her &s;ituation, and can give &s;ufficient rea&s;ons why &s;he is di&s;&s;atisfied; but &s;he cannot remove with|out permi&s;&s;ion from the bi&s;hop, to whom &s;he is obliged to &s;tate the rea&s;ons why &s;he wi&s;hes for a removal.</P>
<P>The monks have the &s;ame permi&s;&s;ion, but with this difference, that in&s;tead of ap|plying to the bi&s;hop, they need only apply to the general of their order.</P>
<P>Time would fail me to enumerate all the various orders of monks; &s;uch as Capuchins, Bernardins, Jacobins, Benedictines, &amp;c.
<PB N="xxi" REF="035743_0018_1006ABF78F75DAF0">
&s;ome of which &s;have their heads entirely, and wear long beards; others that leave only a narrow lock of hair on the back part of their heads, &s;o contrived as to re&s;emble a crown; others that wear nothing but &s;andals upon their feet; and &s;ome that go entirely barefoot.</P>
<P>At the head of the&s;e hou&s;es are placed per&s;ons of au&s;tere piety, who are to keep a &s;trict watch over the per&s;ons committed to their charge, &s;ee that the conduct of their lives is conformable to their profe&s;&s;ion, and give them all the in&s;truction nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ituation. To a&s;&s;i&s;t them in devotion, and &s;erve them as a confe&s;&s;or, a prie&s;t is ap|pointed to every convent. There is al&s;o, for every religious hou&s;e, a church or cha|pel. Although in all the convents the prie&s;t has permi&s;&s;ion, at times, to vi&s;it every apartment and every per&s;on in them, he is not permitted to &s;leep within the walls of tho&s;e appointed for women, but has a hou&s;e appointed for him without.</P>
<P>The religious hou&s;es of women are &s;ome|times made u&s;e of as &s;eminaries of learning, for the in&s;truction of young ladies. The nuns are employed for teachers. Here they can be in&s;tructed in every u&s;eful and orna|mental branch of knowledge; &s;uch as read|ing, writing, plain needle work, and every thing belonging to an ordinary education,
<PB N="xxii" REF="035743_0019_1006ABFD76AAF6F0">
mu&s;ic, painting, embroidery, &amp;c. belong|ing to an education more refined: and if the nuns cannot teach them, they hire ma&s;|ters for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e privileges they can enjoy without taking the veil. Other ladies, at any time of life, having met with misfortunes, or any cau&s;e inclining them to retire from the world, if they are per&s;ons of good character, may occa&s;ionally repair to the convents, and, by paying for their board, may enjoy the privileges of retirement for any length of time, and leave it whenever they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the large cities throughout tho&s;e countries where the Romi&s;h religion prevails, there are one or more convents. Before the late revolution, the city of Paris,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brooke's Gazetteer.</NOTE> in France, contained three abbies of men, five of women, fifty-three convents and communities of monks, and &s;eventy nun|neries and communities of women, which amounted to one hundred and thirty-four in that city alone. It has been &s;aid, that the general of the Dominicans in Spain, has boa&s;ted that he could bring 200,000 monks into the field without any great diminution of their number in the convents. From this we may &s;afely conclude, that the number of tho&s;e in the afore&s;aid countries
<PB N="xxiii" REF="035743_0020_1006AC0230B44300">
who lead the conventual life, mu&s;t, in all, amount to &s;everal millions. Be&s;ides tho&s;e built in large cities, there are &s;ome mona&s;|teries built in places of retirement, &s;ome|times adjoining or in the mid&s;t of large fore&s;ts, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from any inhabited part of the country.</P>
<P>Some convents are of an order who po&s;|&s;e&s;s great wealth, enjoy the comforts and conveniences of life even to luxury, and are only re&s;tricted to certain rules, which are not very &s;evere; others are extremely poor, and are nece&s;&s;itated to employ &s;everal per|&s;ons to go into the adjacent country and a&s;k charity for their &s;upport: &s;ome, on the contrary, are re&s;tricted to rules which have ever been e&s;teemed, by prote&s;tants, to be ex|ceedingly &s;uper&s;titious and &s;evere; much more &s;o than the mild and benevolent &s;y&s;tem of the go&s;pel requires: for in&s;tance, there are &s;ome orders who &s;leep in their cof|fins every night, and every day vi&s;it their graves, out of which they throw a &s;mall quantity of earth to keep them in perpetual mind of death. The &s;tricter orders never eat any fle&s;h, have frequent and &s;evere fa&s;ts, live upon a &s;pare diet; but fi&s;h are &s;ome|times allowed to all. There is an order of monks who make a vow of perpetual &s;ilence, and are, accordingly, compelled never to &s;peak on any occa&s;ion until the time of their
<PB N="xxiv" REF="035743_0021_1006AC06D08E1D08">
di&s;&s;olution approaches; when, if any part of their hi&s;tory is thought worthy of being communicated, or any momentous affair lies upon their minds, they are at liberty to reveal it: of this the Benedictine Ab|bey La Trappe is a remarkable in&s;tance. It is &s;eated in the dioce&s;s of Seez, which is a town in a territory of France, called Perche, in a large valley encircled by moun|tains. The monks in this abbey cover their heads with a large hood, &s;pend mo&s;t of their time &s;itting in a &s;tooping po&s;ture, and looking downwards, by which means they &s;eldom &s;ee each other. It &s;eems to be a nece&s;&s;ary caution, or an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule among&s;t them, not to look at one another; for the expre&s;&s;ion of the features is &s;ome|times &s;o commanding, that it would be more difficult to keep &s;ilence. The de|&s;cription of the garden belonging to this mona&s;tery, as given by an ingenious Eng|li&s;h writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sketches from Nature, vol. i. p. 163.</NOTE> who has vi&s;ited it in per&s;on, is &s;o worthy of a place, that I &s;hall here tran&s;|cribe it in his own words: "Both the gar|den and mona&s;tery are encircled with a wood; it participates the gloom of the or|der it belongs to&mdash;every member cultivates his own &s;olitary &s;pot&mdash;in&s;tead of the luxuri|ant beauty of odoriferous flowers, is &s;een
<PB N="xxv" REF="035743_0022_1006AC0D676AFCF8">
only beds of herbs and vegetables, and plan|tations of tobacco, which all monks are particularly fond of. Around it are long walks of pines and cypre&s;&s;es, here and there intermixed with clumps of the &s;ame kind of trees; and benches placed at the roots of &s;everal of them, de&s;igned for repo&s;e or me|ditation."</P>
<P>There have doubtle&s;s been in&s;tances of per&s;ons, who, by a due improvement of the advantages the&s;e religious hou&s;es afford for contemplation and retirement, have carried their piety to an extent which can &s;eldom be equalled by tho&s;e who are embarra&s;&s;ed with the cares, bu&s;ine&s;s and cu&s;toms of the world. But the condition of the&s;e devotees is &s;o perfectly unnatural, &s;o contrary to the original de&s;ign for which man was created, that many have con&s;idered the cloi&s;ters bet|ter calculated to promote the purpo&s;es of impiety and impurity of life than tho&s;e of religion. When we con&s;ider that the &s;trength of human pa&s;&s;ions is not always dimini&s;hed by privation, but is mo&s;t ge|nerally increa&s;ed in con&s;equence of it, to the eye of rea&s;on it &s;eems clear, that the con|vents cannot be favourable to religion or morality. The circum&s;tance of the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts being con&s;trained to live always in a &s;tate of celibacy; their frequent occa&s;ions of entering the religious hou&s;es of women;
<PB N="xxvi" REF="035743_0023_1006AC14AD0325C8">
their cu&s;tom of being in private with every per&s;on at the time of confe&s;&s;ion; the proba|bility that they are not all virtuous men, nor all the women in the cloi&s;ters of the &s;tricte&s;t piety, have given ample grounds for per&s;ons of a &s;u&s;picious temper, to form an opinion of their characters and conduct unfavourable to their reputation.</P>
<P>But the cu&s;tom which prevails in all coun|tries that have embraced the Romi&s;h reli|gion, of parents &s;ending their daughters un|willingly to the convents, and obliging them, by compul&s;ory mea&s;ures, to take the veil, that they may be&s;tow their fortunes on a favourite child or children, or preventing a daughter from marrying a per&s;on they do not approve, is an in&s;tance of extreme bar|barity. To behold an amiable and engag|ing daughter, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every attraction, both of mind and per&s;on, compelled, by cruel cu&s;tom and unfeeling parents, to linger away her golden morning of life in a conven|tual pri&s;on, where the expre&s;&s;ive look, the enchanting &s;mile, and every plea&s;ing quality of her mind and features are all lo&s;t to the world, mu&s;t be painful to the beholder. Tho&s;e charms which were given her by the creator of the world for the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t benevolent de&s;igns, and which &s;ome ad|miring youth of the other &s;ex would have deemed an invaluable trea&s;ure, are &s;ecluded,
<PB N="xxvii" REF="035743_0024_1006AC169CC97608">
by impenetrable walls, from all the endear|ments of &s;ociety. Such a &s;pectacle mu&s;t excite in the bo&s;om of compa&s;&s;ion, the tendere&s;t pity for the victims of tyrannical cu&s;tom, and the livelie&s;t indignation again&s;t tho&s;e abominable in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>It is generally known in prote&s;tant coun|tries, that celibacy is enjoined upon all the Romi&s;h clergy; but if it were not known, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;aying any thing upon that &s;ubject in this place, is &s;uper&s;eded by a note annexed to the 66th letter of the fol|lowing work.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting divorce, the law in Catholic countries is, perhaps, more &s;trict than even the chri&s;tian religion requires. Our Saviour him&s;elf admitted of one in&s;tance in which it is allowable. But among&s;t the Catholics it has generally been unattainable in any ca&s;e whatever. In &s;ome few in&s;tances it has been obtained by a &s;pecial licen&s;e from the Pope, who, for a large &s;um of money, would give indulgences for di&s;pen&s;ing with every &s;acred obligation. By rea&s;on of the many compul&s;ory marriages which took place in European countries, the &s;trictne&s;s of this law became a &s;ubject of frequent com|plaint. This has been eminently the ca&s;e with France; and it was not late in the revo|lution before they attempted and obtained a repeal of this and &s;everal other ancient
<PB N="xxviii" REF="035743_0025_1006AC1B0858AC48">
laws: but, unfortunately for the nation, the French, in their rage for a reform, have, in many re&s;pects, gone beyond all rea&s;on|able limits. Yet, if we con&s;ider that they were a people who were generally de&s;titute of much information, and had long groaned under a va&s;t weight of oppre&s;&s;ion, which would make even a wi&s;e man di&s;tracted, and often mi&s;led by artful and intriguing wretches who de&s;erve not the name of men, we &s;hall not be a&s;toni&s;hed at their exce&s;&s;es; nor &s;hall we be over-liberal in a&s;cribing pe|culiar depravity to the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the French people. Perhaps it would well become the citizens of the American &s;tates, before comparing the conduct of the French with that of our own countrymen, and ex|ulting in our &s;uperior virtues, to view them as emerging from the dark clouds of igno|rance and &s;uper&s;tition, whil&s;t we, though not free from prejudices, are repo&s;ing in a clearer &s;un&s;hine of moral and &s;cientific light.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;aid in any part of this introduction, I tru&s;t I cannot be accu&s;ed of wilfully mi&s;repre&s;enting the Romi&s;h Church; and, if I am inaccurate in any particular, the candid reader will impute the error to want of information. I am &s;en&s;ible that even that &s;y&s;tem, when unconnected with the civil power, is as little injurious to &s;ociety, and, perhaps, blended with as few dangerous
<PB N="xxix" REF="035743_0026_1006AC21221799A0">
errors as that of &s;ome &s;ects of Prote&s;tants. Nor is it to be doubted but there have been, among&s;t the Catholics, men of very liberal &s;entiments and genuine piety. From many writers who profe&s;s that religion, e&s;pecially in France, have proceeded &s;ermons, and other writings on moral and religious &s;ub|jects, that would do honour to any Prote&s;|tant divines. They believe, in common with Prote&s;tants, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|portant doctrines of divine revelation. But we believe, notwith&s;tanding, that they are in mo&s;t egregious errors, in teaching for doctrines the commandments of men, and making religion too much con&s;i&s;t in external &s;how and o&s;tentatious ceremonies.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>From the Convent of La Providence, at Paris,
<DATE>May 11, 1782.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WEEP for me my dear Emilia! commi&s;e|rate the victims of the convent with &s;ym|pathetic tears! Thou art no longer the con&s;olation of thy &s;i&s;ter&mdash;thy wretched &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e life is pro|longed but by &s;orrows that will be la&s;ting as its duration.</P>
<P>It was but this morning&mdash;yet it &s;eems already an age, an age of grief and anxiety&mdash;this very morning I took the veil; the eternal &s;acrifice has arrived to its con&s;ummation.</P>
<P>And it was, my deare&s;t Emilia, with the mo&s;t cruel intentions, that the widow of our father, (who de&s;erves not the endearing title of mother) on the very day in which he breathed his la&s;t, cau&s;ed thee to be &s;natched from the convent where we had the mi&s;erable con&s;olation of &s;ighing toge|ther: it was nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould be &s;eparated to render us a more ea&s;y conque&s;t; whil&s;t we were united, we were too &s;trong again&s;t her tyrannical per&s;ua&s;ions. Not that I was blinded to &s;uch a de|gree as to believe your courageous coun&s;els could
<PB N="32" REF="035743_0028_1006AC29905BDDC0">
have always protected me again&s;t the fierce pa&s;|&s;ions of our enemy, or my own imbecility: for, having never &s;een the barbarous wife of my father but to &s;igh and tremble in her pre&s;ence, I have not, in any encounter, been able to conquer my timi|dity or my terror. Sen&s;ible I am, that Madame de Varmont, with one threatening look, or one frowning word, could, at any time, overcome my firme&s;t re&s;olutions; and, &s;ooner or later, not|with&s;tanding your re&s;i&s;tance, and even before your eyes, that &s;he would &s;ucceed in forcing her victim to the foot of the altar: yet, as the day of my op|pre&s;&s;ion became that of your deliverance, my great misfortunes &s;hould offer me a powerful mo|tive of con&s;olation. Ah! if you could bear wit|ne&s;s to the de&s;pair which &s;eized the brea&s;t of the unhappy Celina, at the hour &s;he was compelled to be immolated, how &s;oon would that ju&s;t reluctance you have always manife&s;ted for this tedious, indo|lent and abandoned &s;tate which they call the con|ventual life, be changed to everla&s;ting hatred? and if they had &s;ucceeded in forcing you only to try the&s;e fatal garments,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The dre&s;s of the novitiate<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> this mourning habit to which your &s;i&s;ter has been condemned for a year, alas, and now condemned forever! if they had &s;ucceed|ed in this, and you remained with me, by what means could they have ever forced me to pro|nounce tho&s;e vows which, again&s;t my will, my lips have uttered, and which my &s;tifled &s;ighs would have rendered unintelligible?</P>
<P>But the woman who is called your mother and mine, was pre&s;ent. But how can &s;he be called &s;o when &s;he has neither educated nor &s;upported us? She is not &s;o, for her hatred has con&s;tantly been
<PB N="33" REF="035743_0029_1006AC30DCD852B8">
employed to drive us from her, and pur&s;ue us wherever we went. For her darling &s;on, and for him alone, &s;he has re&s;erved all her maternal ten|derne&s;s. Of this he is a proper object, for his heart is an exact image of her's.</P>
<P>You have much to fear from this cruel brother; although he is &s;carcely twenty years of age, yet his heart is de&s;titute of pity, and his eyes are inca|pable of tears. Could you have believed, that he al&s;o could come and attend the &s;acrifice of a &s;i&s;ter? He attended it with an air of &s;atisfaction! When the arches of the temple re&s;ounded with my cries, even &s;trangers who were pre&s;ent could not but weep, and Madame de Varmont her&s;elf turned pale; but the young man was perfectly unmoved. Great God! I am terrified to think or his future de&s;tiny! for what dreadful fate do&s;t thou re&s;erve him? for what unknown crimes was he brought into exi&s;tence?</P>
<P>Let this picture of my grievous &s;ituation, O lovelie&s;t Emilia, be always before your eyes&mdash;let it con&s;tantly maintain in your mind the livelie&s;t anxiety. Do not forget, that the unhappy lot which has been ca&s;t for me, is the &s;ame they are preparing for your&s;elf. You are not, I am &s;en|&s;ible, &s;o feeble and timorous as I am; this makes me hope you will &s;purn their wicked &s;olicitations, their cruel intreaties, and odious threatenings. But I have &s;till greater fear from their artifices, and warn you to be guarded again&s;t them; for they are capable of trying the mo&s;t &s;hameful artifices that can be imagined; for in&s;tance, they may tell you that Celina lives peaceably and contented; but Oh, if they &s;hould pre&s;ume thus to tell you, &s;hew them this letter, ob&s;cured by my tears and &s;igned with my blood!</P>

<P>YOUR &s;i&s;ter, &s;ometime ago, reconciled her|&s;elf to the only condition which become her fortune, and that of her parents; and I expect you will not be tardy in imitating &s;o good an example.</P>
<P>I am &s;o well convinced of this, that I have ju&s;t now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all your ma&s;ters: For I did not &s;uppo&s;e that a nun had any need of mu&s;ic, nor dancing; nor did I think it nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould be deeply &s;killed in foreign languages; and as to your own language, you already know more of it than is needful for pronouncing your vows.</P>
<P>To-morrow morning I &s;hall &s;end for the prin|cipal part of your clothes. Your father delighted in in&s;piring you with a ta&s;te for luxury, and ideas of coquetry, by which he would certainly have ruined you. Be&s;ides, what benefit would it be to you at pre&s;ent, to have &s;uch an elegant wardrobe? for in eight days, at mo&s;t, you are going to wear the dre&s;s of the novitiate. It this &s;hould chance to be a &s;ituation to which you can never be recon|ciled, do not accu&s;e me of having forced you to accept of it; your reproaches are all due to the memory of M. de Varmont, who&s;e &s;hameful ex|travagance and di&s;&s;ipation have &s;o far dimini&s;hed his fortune, that the remainder is barely &s;ufficient for the advancement of my dear &s;on; the intere&s;ting youth who is the only &s;olace of his mother, and the only hope of his family. But you, and your

&s;i&s;ter will continue your former idolatry for your father. And why &s;hould I be &s;urpri&s;ed at it? he was all &s;implicity, and you adored him becau&s;e he was the torment of my life.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, young lady, that I have but a few words to &s;ay to you. You are untractable, opinionative, and have a mighty talent for argument; but you mu&s;t know that the tyrannical power of your father has ended with his life; that now it is my turn to command, and my commands &s;hall be obeyed.</P>

<P>THE inclo&s;ed is a letter I received this morning from my mother, &s;ent me from the parlour of the convent, which I &s;end you in ha&s;te, being overjoyed to find that my two la&s;t have reached you by the way you pointed out, and that you con&s;ider it a &s;afe means of corre&s;pondence. Al|though the cruel orders of my mother gave me no &s;urpri&s;e, I was much a&s;toni&s;hed on recognizing the per&s;on by whom &s;he &s;ent them; it was M. Bovile, that young man of elevated &s;tature, noble figure, and plea&s;ing deportment, whom our father called his pupil; whom he &s;ometimes brought home with him, and who&s;e exploits he mentioned with un|u&s;ual delight, when he returned from his late cam|paign.</P>

<P>ATTEND, my &s;i&s;ter: he returned this morning, and you will be &s;urpri&s;ed at the extraordinary declaration he has made me.</P>
<P>"I come," &s;ays he, "to a&s;k you whether you had rather marry than comply with the arbitrary will of your mother; and whether, from what you have &s;een of me, you have any objections to my per&s;on? As I have &s;eldom had the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you, and am to you almo&s;t an entire

&s;tranger, I can expect nothing more. But what I &s;ay of my&s;elf with re&s;pect to you, I can almo&s;t &s;ay of you, Madamoi&s;elle, with re&s;pect to me. If I &s;hould &s;wear that I adored you, it would be a fal&s;ehood which you could not believe. But with &s;incerity can I declare, that whatever is intere&s;ting in your youth, beauty or misfortunes (and greatly intere&s;ting they are) makes a &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion on my heart. You are, I make no doubt, capa|ble of in&s;piring the heart with livelier &s;entiments than the&s;e, and I am convinced that I might here|after experience them; but this is what I cannot engage before hand. Many women who were, perhaps, as hand&s;ome as you, have never been pa&s;&s;ionately beloved, and were not le&s;s happy in con&s;equence of it. All that I can promi&s;e you, therefore, if my offers are not rejected, is this, that none of tho&s;e women who believe them&s;elves the idols of their hu&s;bands, will have more rea&s;on to boa&s;t of their kind and faithful attention than your&s;elf: for my wife, next to my country, &s;hall always be the object of my tendere&s;t care and mo&s;t anxious &s;olicitude."</P>
<P>When this extraordinary man had thus &s;poken, he was about ri&s;ing to take his leave, whil&s;t I, Celina, overwhelmed with a confu&s;ion and &s;ur|pri&s;e, to which nothing could be compared but my embarra&s;&s;ment, &s;tood li&s;tening, in &s;ilence, as if he had not ended his &s;peech. After a few moments of &s;ilence, he thus re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e: "I have to lament, Madamoi&s;elle, that I can give you but a few hours for deliberation; my &s;hip is in readi|ne&s;s, and waiting for me, and the war calls me away. Reflect on this matter till evening: this evening I mu&s;t return for your an&s;wer, and if it is favourable, I &s;hall ha&s;ten to Madame de Varmont
<PB N="38" REF="035743_0034_1006AC469B21C148">
to obtain her con&s;ent; to-morrow we mu&s;t be married, and the day after I mu&s;t depart."</P>
<P>He then bowed re&s;pectfully, and went away; but in an in&s;tant afterwards he returned.</P>
<P>"Do not," &s;aid he, "put off the execution of my de&s;igns till the end of the campaign. I will not de|ceive you, young woman, concerning my pro|fe&s;&s;ion; you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible it is a dangerous one. Do not, incon&s;iderately, ri&s;k the repo&s;e of your life with the dangers of mine. But who will de|cide for you in this critical moment? Will you be guided by the cu&s;toms of the world? I believe you will not; for they are prepo&s;terous, and will be of no avail. Decide, then, for your&s;elf, and decide with calmne&s;s. Never &s;hall I be tempted to be|lieve you were in ha&s;te to marry, nor do I make the&s;e propo&s;als on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition; but I have taken the liberty to believe you are de&s;irous of being freed from this confinement, and the per&s;ecution of your mother. I mu&s;t now take leave of you till evening."</P>
<P>O my &s;i&s;ter, what advice can you give me? it &s;eems that I ought not to he&s;itate in accepting his per&s;on and protection; but I know not what an&s;wer to give him: I &s;hall, therefore, wait until I hear from you.</P>

Bovile, in propo&s;ing to be your protector, acquits him&s;elf of every obligation. From a man who is capable of paying the debt of gratitude with &s;o much genero&s;ity, you may expect every thing virtuous and good. Accept, then, his generous propo&s;als: Bovile merits the great reward of ob|taining Emilia. Accept his propo&s;als&mdash;the idea of your happine&s;s will &s;ooth my misfortunes.</P>

<P>PARDON me, my once lovely, but now long lo&s;t Eleanor! I am, for the fir&s;t time, about to afflict you with a &s;ubject which &s;hall never be recalled to your remembrance. Yes, that Bovile whom you &s;o tenderly e&s;teemed&mdash;that Bovile who &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to obtain you&mdash;who&s;e de&s;ires and endeavours would have been crowned with

&s;ucce&s;s, had there ever been a father di&s;po&s;ed to give his daughter to the one who be&s;t knew how to merit her, by a love at once the mo&s;t ardent and re&s;pectful&mdash;that Bovile, who&s;e de&s;pair, when they gave you to the arms of another, threatened to co&s;t him his life&mdash;that Bovile whom your ever re&s;pected commands, and yours alone, after &s;uch a misfortune, could have per&s;uaded to live; yet had determined to live &s;ingle, that he might always have it in his power to wor&s;hip your image with|out di&s;traction&mdash;that Bovile has altered his mind.</P>
<P>You wrote ye&s;terday, if I mi&s;take not, that my intended wife mu&s;t be an engaging per&s;on; but you, more ea&s;ily than any other per&s;on, will be per&s;uaded that this is not the rea&s;on why I have changed my former re&s;olution. I know otherwi&s;e, and what truth may not be told to you, Eleanor, whom no truth can offend, if it is not flattering nor di&s;honourable? there is nothing, I am &s;en&s;i|ble, more deceitful than the phy&s;iognomy of a young girl; I know that the mo&s;t hand&s;ome are &s;eldom the be&s;t. But if the one in que&s;tion were the be&s;t among&s;t the greate&s;t beauties, I could not marry in a country where the bands of Hymen are bound with &s;uch a frightful indi&s;&s;olubility, without &s;ome diffidence: nor am I in&s;en&s;ible how nece&s;&s;ary it is to know our own minds before we enter into an engagement which nothing but death can di&s;&s;olve. Neverthele&s;s, every thing con&s;pires to convince me of the propriety of my conduct in ha&s;tening my marriage with this young &s;tranger, the daughter of my benefactor, and re&s;cuing her from the unhappy condition which they are preparing for her. But can &s;he, in good faith, ever cau&s;e me to repent the ha&s;tine&s;s of my proceedings? Admitting that this woman may one

day be guilty of ingratitude, and wanting in due re&s;pect towards me, I &s;hall then con&s;ole my&s;elf, and ju&s;tify my pre&s;ent conduct, by recollecting the motives which, at that time, gave me no liberty of choice nor reflection. On the contrary, what happine&s;s, what &s;upreme felicity for us both&mdash; what an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of enjoyment it would be, if I &s;hould find &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es tho&s;e virtues which I may ju&s;tly expect! if I &s;hould find the &s;weete&s;t recompence of my imprudent &s;acri|fices in their very object! But be this as it may, can I, in this extraordinary in&s;tance, give way to per&s;onal con&s;iderations? Have I any right to deli|berate when it is incumbent on me to fulfil an obligation? And if I &s;hould, in this in&s;tance, neg|lect the performance of my duty, would it not be one, among&s;t many in&s;tances, wherein &s;elf-love has given countenance to ingratitude?</P>
<P>We &s;hall neither of us forget, Eleanor, that a ridiculous and di&s;couraging prejudice threatened to make me langui&s;h in the ob&s;curity of an inferior rank, in which ob&s;curity I might have died, and been of no &s;ervice to my country: but a brave man di&s;dained not to take notice of the little merit I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, without inquiring into my birth and rank in life. Tho&s;e officers who were noble fearing I might become their equal, did all in their power to prevent it; but my generous benefactor procured my advancement, and made me their &s;uperior; rai&s;ed me in &s;pite of prejudice, and &s;hielded me from the &s;hafts of envy. Did he li&s;ten to the mean coun&s;els of per&s;onal intere&s;t, when, for my &s;ake, he incurred the reproach of his fellow officers, and the enmity of men in power? Was the courage he exerci&s;ed in not abandoning me to the power of my enemies, le&s;s than that by which I &s;hould now be

actuated on marrying his daughter? That M. de Varmont, Eleanor, was a man &s;uperior to the pre&s;ent generation. Notwith&s;tanding the enmity of a few individuals, our navy may well lament his lo&s;s: but to me, the lo&s;s is quite irreparable. To him do I owe my good fortune, my talents and fame. To him do I owe the unexpected happine&s;s of having, in early life, rendered impor|tant &s;ervices to my country. I am now going in ha&s;te to obtain the an&s;wer of Emilia.</P>

<P>HER an&s;wer was &s;hort and deci&s;ive: "If you can find any means, Sir, of per&s;uading my mother to let me live in the world, it &s;hall be the employment of my life to promote the happine&s;s of yours."</P>
<P>Then I ha&s;tened to Madame de Varmont, and found her in company with her &s;on, who were both &s;truck with amazement on hearing my pro|po&s;als.</P>
<P>The young man haughtily a&s;ked me whether I was noble?</P>
<P>"Yes," an&s;wered I, "the enemies of my coun|try both know and fear me."</P>
<P>"I con&s;ider it of no con&s;equence," &s;aid the mother, with an air of di&s;dain, "whether the hu&s;band of my daughter be a pea&s;ant or a noble|man.

<P>"I do not a&s;k any dowry for his &s;i&s;ter, Ma|dame; and to make you ea&s;y on that point, I con|&s;ent to acknowledge that you have given me, for your daughter's inheritance, the &s;um of &mdash;."</P>
<P>"Two hundred thou&s;and crowns!" &s;aid the generous brother, ha&s;tily interrupting me. "Two hundred thou&s;and crowns let it be."</P>
<P>"Can it be po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Madame de Var|mont, with an air of increa&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment, "that you are &s;o &s;trangely &s;mitten with little Emilia?"</P>

<P>"Her father!" cried &s;he fiercely: "peri&s;h his memory, and all that brings him to my remem|brance!"</P>

<P>"My &s;on!" replied &s;he &s;ternly&mdash;"what right have you, Sir, to interrogate me about my &s;on? Do you de&s;ign to make me di&s;cover my &s;ecrets? Perhaps the time may come when they will be made known. But till &s;uch times as they are, I determine they &s;hall be kept inviolably."</P>
<P>"I did not come to di&s;cover your &s;ecrets, Ma|dame; I came to a&s;k your con&s;ent that I may obtain Emilia."&mdash;"No; &s;he &s;hall &s;hare the &s;ame fate as her &s;i&s;ter. An eternal ob&s;tacle forbids my con&s;ent."</P>

<P>"Well," replied &s;he, with an irre&s;olute air, "but &s;he mu&s;t live in the world, and I &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the continual torment of &s;eeing her."</P>
<P>On hearing this my indignation was excited to the highe&s;t degree. "No," &s;aid I, "God forbid! never, never will I give you that torment!"</P>
<P>"What &s;ecurity will you give me that this &s;hall not be the ca&s;e?"</P>

<P>"If it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;if you &s;hould exact it."</P>
<P>"Indeed I &s;hould exact it, and will give my con&s;ent on no other terms."</P>
<P>"Well, I give you my word for it, that your ill-fated daughter &s;hall quit her native city the day after to-morrow, and her country in le&s;s than eight days."</P>
<P>"And never return to it?"</P>
<P>"I have but too well under&s;tood that &s;uch were your intentions."</P>

<P>MY mother, O Celina, has determined that I &s;hould quit France&mdash;that I &s;hould aban|don my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;that my exile and &s;eparation from you &s;hould be perpetual! All-&s;eeing God! who&s;e

piercing eyes can read the thoughts of men, im|printed on their hearts, to thee can I appeal, and declare that I have never merited her hatred!</P>
<P>Of this circum&s;tance I was unacquainted till very lately, even at this critical moment while we are preparing for our embarkation. My hu&s;band, wearied with my importunities, was not able to conceal any longer that horrible circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>You may now behold in me an in&s;tance of a wounded imagination, &s;urrounded by per&s;ecuting phantoms. No &s;ooner was I acquainted with the dreadful engagement my hu&s;band had made, than I leaned forward again&s;t the window, upon my elbow, and gave my&s;elf up to grief. A young man, &s;tanding in the &s;treet facing our inn, gazed at me with &s;o much attention that he attracted mine. Judge how great was my terror when I &s;uppo&s;ed it to be my brother, and was ready to &s;hrink from his &s;ight! yet, terrified as I was, my eyes were every moment mechanically turned towards the object of my fear; but he pre&s;ently turned round and went away, when, by ob&s;erving his hair, I di&s;covered my error. My brother's hair is of a deep red, but that of this young man was brown.</P>
<P>In a few minutes we &s;hall be ready to &s;ail. I am going on board one of the &s;hips belonging to the fleet of merchantmen, which is to be e&s;corted by a &s;quadron of armed &s;hips, in which Bovile commands a frigate: for he cho&s;e not to expo&s;e me with him&s;elf on board a &s;hip &s;ubject to the ter|rors and dangers of a naval engagement. We are bound to the We&s;t-Indies, and at the end of our voyage he expects to leave me at Martinique, where he owns &s;ome plantations. He purpo&s;es to &s;pend &s;everal months with me every year, at that place, and will devote to me every hour he can

Kind Heaven, that takes pity on the unfortunate, has re&s;erved for me a recompence for my former unhappine&s;s, and has given it to me in the be&s;t of men, and mo&s;t generous of hu&s;bands.

<P>THE day before ye&s;terday, Emilia, &s;ome hours after our parting, and your departure for Bre&s;t, the &s;on of Madame de Varmont&mdash;indeed &s;he in&s;i&s;ts on my calling her by no other name than Madame de Varmont; and &s;ince &s;he, as well as her &s;on, are nothing to me, and I have no longer any mother nor brother, he ought to be called M. de Varmont&mdash;M. de Varmont, then, has pre&s;um|ed to make me a vi&s;it; but before I had time to reproach him for his hard-heartedne&s;s, his avarice, and that thir&s;t after riches which made him &s;uffer, or rather de&s;ire, I &s;hould be &s;acrificed; before I could &s;ay one word again&s;t it, he &s;aid, "Your &s;i&s;ter, I

hope, is well married, and my fortune, in con&s;e|quence of it, is greatly dimini&s;hed; you cannot, therefore, any longer accu&s;e me of ambition; for it was I who per&s;uaded Madame de Varmont to give little Emilia a dowry of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and livres."</P>
<P>As your had informed me that the generous Bo|vile, in order to obtain you, was obliged to ac|knowledge the receipt of a &s;um they had never paid him, you can ea&s;ily conceive what an effect his &s;peech had upon me. De&s;irous of knowing whether he was undauntedly per&s;evering in fal&s;e|hood, and whether he could &s;upport the weight of unmerited prai&s;e, I prai&s;ed his benevolence, and extolled his ju&s;tice. I can a&s;&s;ure you, Emilia, that he &s;eemed to hear me with that innocent and mild &s;erenity, with that noble and virtuous mo|de&s;ty, which a few days before I had &s;een in your hu&s;band, and which I &s;hould have thought had never been ob&s;ervable in any men but &s;uch as were really benevolent. But learn, my &s;i&s;ter, for it is nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould be warned how much you ought to mi&s;tru&s;t this mo&s;t fatal enemy you can have; learn, I &s;ay, with what reflections he re|warded my approbation of him: "Doubtle&s;s," &s;aid he (&s;trutting about with an air of &s;elf-impor|tance) "one would not willingly pay &s;o hand&s;ome a &s;um, but it is likely that it may be repaid me at &s;ome future time: your &s;i&s;ter is of a weakly con&s;titution, and if &s;he &s;hould die without any children, her hu&s;band is able to repay me her dowry."</P>
<P>On hearing his la&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, I trembled with indignation, and could &s;carcely forbear in loading him with reproaches; but cautiou&s;ly checking my
<PB N="50" REF="035743_0046_1006AC7A292080E0">
re&s;entment, I gave him an indignant, &s;ignificant glance, and withdrew.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time &s;ince, a dome&s;tic of Madame de Varmont came to inquire of me, whether I had &s;een her &s;on on the day before ye&s;terday. It &s;eems, from this circum&s;tance, that he left Paris almo&s;t immediately after making me that vi&s;it. All that is known re&s;pecting his departure is, that he took po&s;t hor&s;es, and, for a &s;ervant, he took with him the in&s;olent Lafleur, whom he has made his friend and confidant. Although Madame de Varmont has been accu&s;tomed to the ab&s;ence of her &s;on, &s;he &s;eemed, in this in&s;tance of it, to be more anxious than u&s;ual. The rea&s;on for her being peculiarly anxious &s;eems to be, that he went away, this time, without taking leave of her: and I al&s;o, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, am a&s;toni&s;hed at a precipitation &s;o great, and &s;o full of my&s;tery. If he had nothing in view but going on tho&s;e parties of plea&s;ure which have &s;ometimes occupied him for whole weeks together, and with which our father was &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed, it &s;eems &s;trange that he did not acquaint his mother of it, for he generally informs her of all his move|ments. What then can be his intentions? Where can he be gone? Indeed I care not, provided he will go &s;o far that he will never return to terrify either you or me with his odious pre&s;ence.</P>

This morning, at break of day, being called home by urgent bu|&s;ine&s;s, I left Bre&s;t, wi&s;hing you, my di&s;loyal friend, all the bad &s;ucce&s;s in the world.</P>
<P>Are you not &s;urpri&s;ed that I have made &s;o little progre&s;s in my journey, that I am no farther than Chateaulin this evening? I'll tell you the rea&s;on, my friend: 'tis becau&s;e I am born to good for|tune as well as you: for at day-break this morn|ing, between Bre&s;t and Doulas, I found a prize, a &s;weet young female, upon the highway. You will be ready to inquire what &s;he was doing there. I'll tell you, my friend: She was mo&s;t gently winding her way towards the other world, and if my po&s;tilion had not taken care, he would won|derfully have a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in fini&s;hing her cour&s;e; for he partly rode over her, which &s;o affected me that I could not be comforted. Only con&s;ider, that even in a &s;woon, apparently dead or dying, her hands bloody, and her face wounded, &s;he had &s;till a thou&s;and charms. Mu&s;t &s;he not then be &s;u|premely beautiful?</P>
<P>But who could have left her in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion? Some &s;avage bea&s;t, mo&s;t certainly! for it is impo&s;&s;ible but &s;uch beauty mu&s;t have di&s;armed the fierce&s;t barbarian among&s;t men. The next que&s;tion is, to whom does &s;he belong? I cannot tell, for &s;he is yet &s;peechle&s;s. What I mo&s;t wi&s;h to know is, whether &s;he is a wife or a maid. But I hope &s;he will &s;peedily recover, and then I &s;hall &s;oon &s;ettle that point without perplexing her with que&s;tions. In &s;uch ca&s;es I prefer &s;earching;
<PB N="54" REF="035743_0050_1006AC925B5AE248">
and have more faith in its re&s;ult than a thou&s;and interrogatories. I love to &s;ee for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In expectation of that happy moment, and as a preparatory &s;tep to it, I put the fair cripple in my po&s;t chai&s;e. For that purpo&s;e I engaged fre&s;h hor&s;es from thence to Doulas; for in the mi&s;erable village where we were there was no phy&s;ician to be found. We came as far as Chateaulin: here I am, writing to you near the bed of my fair pa|tient, who is &s;carcely any better.</P>
<P>I can now acquaint you with &s;omething quite &s;ingular, and which has not a little alarmed me. Whil&s;t writing to you I chanced to mention your name, and had no &s;ooner done &s;o than &s;he repeat|ed it. Overjoyed at hearing her &s;peak for the fir&s;t time, I ran precipitately to her bed. She, &s;eemingly, exerted all her &s;trength to look at me; but with a look full of anxiety and confu&s;ion, "Varmont!" &s;aid &s;he, "do you know him?"</P>
<P>"Know him," an&s;wered I; "yes, I am his in|timate friend." Upon this &s;he &s;prang to the other &s;ide of the bed, as if terrified at the &s;ight of me. "Are you al&s;o acquainted with Vermont?" con|tinued I. But the poor little creature was gone. Notwith&s;tanding her &s;woon, the phy&s;ician, who has not di&s;covered any dangerous wound upon her, expects that in a few days &s;he will be able to give us her hi&s;tory; and I have made a &s;tand here, in order to wait upon her: &s;he is well worth the pains; and when there is a fair pro&s;pect of her re|covery I &s;hall take her away with me.</P>
<P>Now I think of it, what a deal of noi&s;e they made la&s;t night in the harbour of Bre&s;t! Some in|famous ra&s;cals attempted to burn the fleet and the convoy, which was &s;oon expected to &s;ail. It was &s;aid that the Pallas had been on fire, but the di|ligence
<PB N="55" REF="035743_0051_1006AC9427565BB8">
of the captain had &s;aved it. That Bovile is a prodigy of vigilance and activity, and although I do not like him, I am forced, in &s;pite of me, to e&s;|teem him and do him ju&s;tice. Well would it be for him if all his enemies re&s;embled me; for he has a multitude of them, and &s;ome are mo&s;t implacable. When I left the captains of the &s;quadron they were in a di&s;po&s;ition which forebodes nothing good to him. I will bet an hundred again&s;t one that he will not have a pro&s;perous campaign. And what &s;illy demon advi&s;ed your father to take a &s;ubject who was but a common &s;ailor in a merchant &s;hip to incorporate him with us? Why &s;hould he wi&s;h to have him out&s;trip every body el&s;e, and &s;upport him as a captain again&s;t wind and tide? It was &s;hocking to &s;erve a man &s;o; he might as well have drowned him.</P>
<P>Ah! I had forgot; I was told that one of the merchant &s;hips in the fleet had blown up. Fie upon it! the accounts were exaggerated. As for my&s;elf, I had too much and too urgent bu&s;ine&s;s to permit my longer &s;tay, &s;o that I was obliged to come off without going into the harbour for par|ticular inquiries. That the Pallas received but little damage, and the re&s;t of the fleet remained un|hurt, is important. But as for the &s;hip blown up, it was but a merchantman, a mere trifle! As for commercial affairs, I don't concern my&s;elf with them.</P>
<P>Farewell, Varmont; I am going to feel the pul&s;e of my little patient. If &s;he does not run di&s;tracted on hearing the name of Varmont, and proves to be an acquaintance of yours, I will in|form you. You mu&s;t inform me who &s;he is; what is the be&s;t mode of commencing an attack upon her, and what hopes I may entertain of being &s;uc|ce&s;sful. But never fear; I tru&s;t that by the time
<PB N="56" REF="035743_0052_1006AC990B00C1D8">
your an&s;wer will arrive, I &s;hall have nothing to hope for. You know I am not fond of long &s;ieges, but be&s;t plea&s;ed with a &s;udden a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>Since you are &s;o prudently concealed in Bre&s;t, I &s;hall not &s;end this letter to you there, but &s;hall, in great innocence, direct it to M. de Varmont at Paris.</P>

<P>I REALLY believe &s;he knows you; but am &s;ure &s;he does not love you: you mu&s;t have given her &s;ome very ill treatment.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t night in almo&s;t continual faintne&s;s. Her attendants under&s;tood nothing &s;he &s;aid, for her &s;peech was incoherent, and her voice extremely feeble. Only in &s;ome in&s;tances, when her fever increa&s;ed &s;o much as to give her unu&s;ual &s;trength, &s;he cried out: "Fire!" and a moment afterwards, by a &s;triking contradiction, &s;he com|plained of a villain, who, &s;he &s;aid, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated her, and ca&s;t her into the water.</P>
<P>That a daring young fellow might have wi&s;hed to burn her, I can ea&s;ily conceive, and, without dif|ficulty, can conceive with what flame; and, pro|vided he had not been un&s;ucce&s;sful, I could pardon the attempt. But to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate her! to drown her! to de&s;troy heaven's ma&s;ter-piece, and give her the waves for a &s;epulchre! If the whole universe con|tains one man who could have conceived &s;uch a
<PB N="57" REF="035743_0053_1006AC9B19AE95C0">
horrible thought, he might de&s;ervedly be called a villain. But I determine, for the honor of human nature, to &s;upport it as an impo&s;&s;ibility, until &s;uch times as the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a mon&s;ter can be proved.</P>
<P>Could you Varmont, (a name &s;he cannot hear without &s;huddering with horror), commit crimes of this nature? No; it is not even po&s;&s;ible. What &s;eems mo&s;t probable is, that you have innocently con&s;pired again&s;t what &s;he, like all other girls, un|doubtedly calls her honor; and as you are not very &s;kilful in the art of plea&s;ing, I can ea&s;ily divine how the whole romance was carried on. In the fir&s;t place, &s;he repul&s;ed your aukward addre&s;&s;es with firmne&s;s; then my poor friend called ha&s;tily to his aid the principle, that when flattering ca|re&s;&s;es will not avail, he may be ju&s;tified in employ|ing force. This, between you and me, is a little brutal. But avoiding digre&s;&s;ions; in the next place, the affrighted fair one, finding every door fa&s;t &s;hut, made her e&s;cape by jumping out of the window; and if, by misfortune, &s;he met with any other ac|cident on the highway before I found her, &s;he will tell me what it was. But as for the&s;e &s;urrounding flames, the&s;e pur&s;uing waves, and the cruel a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in who wi&s;hes to de&s;troy her, they are but con|&s;equences of her delirium in a burning fever. We know how greatly the mental powers are di&s;ordered when the body is tortured with pain.</P>
<P>This morning, as I went into her chamber, &s;he opened her eyes, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure recovered her &s;en&s;es: then &s;he a&s;ked me, "Where we were?"</P>
<P>"At Chateaulin, Mademoi&s;elle," an&s;wered I. I &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle, becau&s;e it is &s;o agreeable to &s;ay what we de&s;ire may prove true; for greatly did I de&s;ire &s;he might prove to be a girl.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="035743_0054_1006AC9E31769130">"O that I might be carried to Bre&s;t again," cried &s;he.</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible," an&s;wered I; "it is impo&s;&s;ible to take you to that place."</P>
<P>"Though I &s;hould die there," continued &s;he, "I could wi&s;h to rejoin the fleet."</P>
<P>"The fleet has &s;ailed."</P>
<P>"Sailed!" cried &s;he: and with a deep &s;igh and a look of un&s;peakable angui&s;h, &s;he again clo&s;ed her charming eyes.</P>
<P>This evening, having come to her&s;elf again, &s;he a&s;ked me, "Where we were?"</P>
<P>"At Chateaulin," Mademoi&s;elle, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"But who are you, Sir?"</P>
<P>"I am Murville." Like an echo which rever|berates the la&s;t &s;yllables in a &s;entence, and multi|plies them, &s;he &s;everal times &s;aid, "ville, ville!" Then a little recovering her &s;trength, &s;he half-rai&s;ed her&s;elf, and leaning on her arms, exhibited the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite figure I ever beheld; her eyes were fixed on me, and her air was &s;o engaging, that it touched me to my very &s;oul. She had not, as ye&s;|terday, an air of terror and anxiety, but of intere&s;t and &s;atisfaction: "ville, ville!" repeated &s;he with a mo&s;t charming accent. "Pray repeat your name, Sir; I heard but the end of it."</P>
<P>"Murville, Mademoi&s;elle." She &s;eemed to be fatigued by rea&s;on of the extreme attention &s;he gave me, and could no longer &s;upport her&s;elf again&s;t her weakne&s;s, but fell down upon her bed almo&s;t as lifele&s;s as before.</P>
<P>It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the charming girl has &s;ome attachment, and although I cannot divine whether it is an attachment by love or marriage, yet I am confident &s;he is &s;ome way attached to a happy mortal, who&s;e name terminates like mine.
<PB N="59" REF="035743_0055_1006ACA2B29979D8">
So much the better for me; it is a fortunate con|formity, which I con&s;ider as a favourable omen. Your name, my dear friend, &s;ounds not &s;o agree|ably in her ears: hear what has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us, and judge for your&s;elf.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time &s;ince &s;he a&s;ked, with tears in her eyes, "Is the fleet departed?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Mademoi&s;elle."</P>
<P>"What! all the &s;hips and all the Captains?"</P>
<P>"Yes, all."</P>
<P>"Then I mu&s;t die! now I am bereft of every hope, and every &s;upport; and into what hands have I fallen!"&mdash;"Into the hands of a civil man," replied I, "who &s;wears that he will never do you the lea&s;t injury."</P>
<P>"No injury!" repeated &s;he. "Can it be po&s;|&s;ible that I have been deceived? Have you not mentioned the name of a certain per&s;on?"</P>
<P>"Yes, I mentioned my own name, which is Murville."</P>
<P>"But another, another! Ah! it is po&s;&s;ible that in my fearful delirium I might have been dreaming; and now I am awake, &s;uppo&s;e it to have been a reality. Did you not tell me, Sir, that you were the intimate friend of &mdash;"</P>
<P>"Of Varmont; yes, young woman, I did tell you &s;o." Poor Varmont! I am grieved for you! But painful as it may be, I mu&s;t tell you the truth: This is the &s;econd time &s;he has fainted on hearing your name mentioned.</P>

<P>BELIEVE me, Varmont, &s;he does not love you at all. Hear the conver&s;ation we have had together, and you will be convinced of it.</P>
<P>"What have I done to you?" &s;aid &s;he. Believ|ing &s;he was &s;till delirious, I made no reply.</P>
<P>"What have I done to you, M. Murville, to de&s;erve your hatred?"</P>
<P>This &s;peech was &s;o well directed to me that I in&s;tantly replied: "You have done nothing to di&s;|plea&s;e me, young woman, and I am very far from hating you."</P>
<P>"Why then are you connected with the cruel men who per&s;ecute me?"</P>
<P>"I am not connected with them&mdash;I am alone."</P>
<P>"How! are you not in the intere&s;t of &s;ome per&s;on?"</P>
<P>"In truth I am not; I am in no one's intere&s;t but my own."</P>
<P>"Who delivered me into your hands?"</P>
<P>"You came into my hands by mere accident; you was dying on the public road. There it was that I found you; I took you up, and &s;pared no pains to re&s;tore you to your &s;en&s;es."</P>
<P>"What were your motives?"</P>
<P>"Your &s;ituation excited my pity, and I was charmed with your beauty."</P>
<P>"But have you no intention of delivering me into the hands of him you call your friend?"</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="035743_0057_1006ACABA39A4200">Ob&s;erve this, my friend; &s;eemingly dreading to mention your name, &s;he avoided it by a circum|locution.</P>
<P>"No," replied I with earne&s;tne&s;s, "I would not deliver you into the hands of the greate&s;t monarch on earth; believe me, I &s;hould be &s;u|premely happy if I might be permitted to keep you for my&s;elf."</P>

<P>"Will you take that engagement upon you?"</P>
<P>"Whil&s;t you confide in my protection no one &s;hall do you the lea&s;t injury, I give you my word for it, and pledge my honor."</P>
<P>For a while &s;he &s;eemed to be more ea&s;y, and &s;omewhat relieved from a load of anxiety; but a little afterwards, with an anxious look, &s;he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"How can I rely on the word of a man who is his friend?"</P>
<P>"Truly, young woman, I cannot do my&s;elf ju&s;tice without acknowledging that I am not a very good &s;ubject, but I &s;hould do my&s;elf no inju&s;|tice by &s;aying that I am a better one than he."</P>
<P>"Alas!" replied &s;he, "where can a wor&s;e than he be found?"</P>
<P>This la&s;t reflection of her's &s;hows how little &s;he e&s;teems you, and proves her to be well ac|quainted with your merit: but this is a matter of your own concern, and you mu&s;t take it upon your&s;elf.</P>
<P>For my&s;elf, I have &s;worn to defend her again&s;t every enemy. By the&s;e a&s;&s;urances &s;he was &s;o much encouraged, that her phy&s;ician, in a few hours af|terwards, found her much better; her fever was greatly dimini&s;hed; &s;he no longer appeared to be the prey of continual perturbation; tho&s;e fits of

extreme angui&s;h which made us de&s;pair of her life had &s;ub&s;ided. Her body, however, was &s;till in a langui&s;hing &s;tate, and her mind alternately labour|ing under &s;ome weighty affliction. The departure of the fleet was to her a cau&s;e of great grief; in|&s;omuch that &s;he &s;ometimes cried bitterly.</P>
<P>Forbear, Varmont, forbear to lay claim to her, for if &s;he don't cordially dete&s;t you, may the devil fly away with me!</P>
<P>Tell me, then, vain miniature of &s;elf-love, tell me, Varmont (in a whi&s;per), whether you had not a rival who went away in the fleet whom &s;he pre|ferred to you?</P>
<P>In further conver&s;ation with her, I plunged her again into her former &s;ad condition, by one unfor|tunate word. Who could have fore&s;een &s;o great an accident?</P>
<P>"You are continually &s;peaking of Bre&s;t, young woman; have you any family connections there?"</P>
<P>"Alas!" cried &s;he pityfully, "I have lo&s;t all my relations!"</P>
<P>"Did your father go away in the fleet?"</P>
<P>"As for my father, I have but too &s;oon lo&s;t him?"</P>
<P>"Your mother? your brother? Have you any brother?"</P>
<P>"My brother! my brother!" repeated &s;he in a frightful voice; and on a &s;udden her countenance was entirely changed, and by a convul&s;ive motion &s;he threw her arms forward and her head back|wards in a frantic manner; drops of cold &s;weat ran down her face, increa&s;ing with palene&s;s to &s;uch a degree that I feared &s;he could live but a few mo|ments.</P>
<P>It is clear, Varmont, that among&s;t all tho&s;e whom &s;he con&s;iders as her per&s;ecutors, you are not the mo&s;t dete&s;table. It is evident that &s;he has a

<P>YOUR &s;ilence a&s;toni&s;hes me, my friend; you ought to be perfectly &s;atisfied with my con|duct. For three days pa&s;t I have written regularly by every courier. Whenever I have quitted a public hou&s;e, I enjoined it upon the ho&s;t to &s;end forward immediately any letters which might ar|rive from Paris, directed to me; but I can hear nothing from you after all my pains. Without examining any further into the rea&s;ons why you have denied me the information I might ju&s;tly have expected from you, I am &s;till willing to repo&s;e in you &s;ome confidence.</P>
<P>For a beginning I will take the trouble of read|ing over my former di&s;patches: after this inform you that a part of my conjectures is verified, but that the other was de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>This terrible brother who gave me &s;o much un|ea&s;ine&s;s is the object who&s;e departure &s;he mourns, whom &s;he often calls from on board the fleet; it is he whom &s;he holds mo&s;t dear: you have there|fore no rival in the fleet. It &s;eems, then, that the poor creature has had no admirer but you. This was quite unfortunate for her; &s;he de&s;erved a much better fate. But for me, who mu&s;t be a great
<PB N="64" REF="035743_0060_1006ACBACF9AF6F0">
gainer by a compari&s;on with you, it will be &s;ingu|larly fortunate. As to the conformity of that name, which terminated &s;o much like mine, and which I con&s;idered as &s;uch a lucky circum&s;tance, I feel more happy on that account than ever, for it happens to be the &s;ame as her's. She calls her&s;elf by the name of Terville. But what gives me the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction is, to learn that &s;he is really a maid. M. de Varmont, I hope &s;he is &s;o in every &s;en&s;e of the word; I hope, that &s;ince you had the ill addre&s;s of letting her get away, that &s;he did &s;o before you accompli&s;hed what &s;he calls your crime.</P>
<P>Ah, the cunning little gip&s;y! becau&s;e &s;he wi&s;hes to &s;pare her&s;elf the blu&s;hes that a relation of her tribulations and your in&s;ults might occa&s;ion her, &s;he has be&s;ought me never to pronounce your name in her hearing, nor &s;ay any thing about you in any conver&s;ation. She has my promi&s;e that I will not; but I am not &s;o much her dupe as to fulfil that promi&s;e; for I expect in your great frankne&s;s, that you will readily make known all tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which her di&s;creet mode&s;ty forbids her to reveal.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another engagement &s;he has de|&s;ired me to make with her, which is, that I am never to give you any information concerning her, and above all things, not to acquaint you with her being in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: and as &s;oon as I informed her what I could not but acknowledge, that you already knew how &s;he came into my hands, &s;he manife&s;ted the &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ires of leaving Chateau|lin and flying to this place. We came here ye&s;ter|day, and the poor creature was &s;o full of mi&s;ery that we were forced to make three &s;hort journies of it. Since our arrival at Langey &s;he has been much better; her wounds are almo&s;t healed; her
<PB N="65" REF="035743_0061_1006ACBF5F344800">
nights are more comfortable; her fever is almo&s;t gone; and her appetite returns. How I rejoice to think, that in a few days &s;he will recover her health, her winning graces, and florid complexion! then &s;hall I behold her in all her native beauty; then &s;he will be worthy of all my attention!</P>
<P>She has made me &s;wear to protect her until &s;he is entirely re&s;tored to health; but I rely on pro|tecting her a much longer time: and though I promi&s;ed not to give you any account of her cir|cum&s;tances and place of retreat, I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity of keeping my word, becau&s;e I do not fancy tho&s;e inconveniences which &s;he imagines may ari&s;e on account of &s;uch a di&s;clo&s;ure. Can it be po&s;&s;ible that M. de Varmont will be &s;o unrea&s;onable as not to yield to the influence of my &s;tars, which have, in this in&s;tance, gained over his &s;uch an evident a&s;cendency? No; certainly he will not be &s;o ob|&s;tinate as to pur&s;ue a hand&s;ome girl to my hou&s;e, when &s;he has only e&s;caped from his arms to fall into mine.</P>
<P>Would it be ju&s;t in you to look &s;urly at me, in ca&s;e I &s;hould not be willing to let you have her again? If you &s;hould, I would publi&s;h your ex|travagant behaviour. Am I to blame becau&s;e you were never capable of winning the affections of one woman? Mu&s;t I, when I have found means of winning tho&s;e you cannot, immediately abandon them to gratify your &s;pleen? Here, for in&s;tance is a lovely girl whom you have tormented and frightened to death; but I have found her, cheered and coaxed her, and prepared her for my&s;elf. You could never have done any thing with her; but I, in a little time, &s;hall do all I can wi&s;h to do. In &s;uch a ca&s;e you ought to give me a complete re&s;ig|nation. If you can derive any con&s;olation from it,

<P>O ELEANOR! fortune was &s;oon weary of regarding me with &s;miles! &s;o great are her fir&s;t rever&s;es, that it requires all my courage to en|dure them!</P>
<P>We were ye&s;terday almo&s;t ready to &s;ail, when the wind aro&s;e with &s;uch violence as to make us fear an approaching tempe&s;t. So great were our alarms that we remained in port, not daring to ri&s;k the convoy in &s;uch a dangerous &s;torm as we appre|hended would take place; but there was only a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind, which we ought not to have feared; yet, in obedience to the &s;ignals, we were obliged to come to anchor. This delay has co&s;t us dear. There is every rea&s;on for believing that if we had &s;ailed la&s;t evening, according to our inten|tions, our merchants would not have to-day to re|gret the lo&s;s of the riche&s;t &s;hip in the fleet; nor I, Eleanor, the lo&s;s of a trea&s;ure un&s;peakably more
<PB N="67" REF="035743_0063_1006ACC79608ABB8">
precious than theirs; a trea&s;ure of who&s;e value I had begun to be very &s;en&s;ible, although it had been but a &s;hort time in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>About midnight, the Centaure, the &s;hip in which my wife was embarked, blew up with a dreadful explo&s;ion. So violent was the explo&s;ion, that &s;e|veral broken, flaming parts of it were driven to the Pallas,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Pallas was the name of the frigate commanded by Bovile.</NOTE> and it was with the greate&s;t difficulty and the mo&s;t &s;peedy exertions, that the burning of that &s;hip was prevented. Conceive the horrors of my &s;itu|ation; the intere&s;ting Emilia is lo&s;t, whil&s;t the &s;al|vation of my &s;hip requires all my attention. Even at the pre&s;ent moment, whil&s;t I am writing to you, I mu&s;t not, and cannot without di&s;traction, give way to grief for my lo&s;s. The intere&s;t of my country compels me away; I mu&s;t depart; I mu&s;t fulfil my duty.</P>
<P>This morning, whil&s;t the nece&s;&s;ary repairs of the Pallas were in forwardne&s;s, I went on &s;hore, and made fruitle&s;s and melancholy &s;earches for Emilia. The &s;ea brought none but dead bodies to the &s;hore; but neither the body of Emilia, nor any trace of her was to be found.</P>
<P>Unhappy woman! why did I not leave her in the cloi&s;ter? In taking her away from what &s;he called her tomb, I have more certainly brought her to an untimely end. When I put her on board this &s;hip, I placed her on her funeral pile. Every precaution I have taken for her &s;afety or happine&s;s has produced a contrary effect. Alas! how un|availing is human prudence!</P>
<P>A con&s;ideration which increa&s;es my affliction is, that there probably are among&s;t my implacable
<PB N="68" REF="035743_0064_1006ACCF06C19D40">
enemies, &s;ome who are &s;uch accompli&s;hed villains, that no means of revenge would be left untried by them, were they ever &s;o ba&s;e. They had no hopes of beginning the fire on board of my &s;hip, for they knew that my vigilance never &s;lumbers; but they flattered them&s;elves that from the Centaure, near which we lay at anchor, the flames might be com|municated to the Pallas; they knew al&s;o that I would &s;ooner peri&s;h with my &s;hip than abandon it. This conjecture, horrible as it is, appears but too well founded. There was but one man &s;aved out of the whole crew of the Centaure; and, if we may believe him, he was &s;aved by nothing le&s;s than a miracle. But we all know the character of this &s;ailor, and how di&s;obedient he is to the orders of the Captain; for he jumps into the &s;ea at the lea&s;t appearance of danger. However it may be, his depo&s;ition is as follows:</P>
<P>"That he &s;lept like the re&s;t of the crew till he was di&s;turbed by a light noi&s;e. He &s;aw a boat, con|ducted by one man only, coming on board the Cen|taure, and one of the pa&s;&s;engers received the watch from the &s;ide of the &s;hip as he de&s;cended from it, and jumped into the boat. At the &s;ame in&s;tant he, the deponent, gave an alarm; but it was too late, for the fire was in&s;tantly di&s;covered in &s;everal parts of the &s;hip at once, and, in a moment afterwards, it blew up with a horrible explo&s;ion, although it was not laden with any warlike &s;tores."</P>
<P>Now, Eleanor, tell me what you think of it, whether you do not believe the lo&s;s of the Cen|taure was more likely to have been effected by a horrible con&s;piracy, than the inexcu&s;able negli|gence of the Captain. Tell me whether you do not believe they had been plotting my de&s;truction. Cruel men! if they had nothing more in view than,
<PB N="69" REF="035743_0065_1006ACD5452444D8">
by adver&s;ity, to &s;often the &s;toici&s;m for which they reproach me, they have but too well &s;ucceeded. I lament the lo&s;s of my young wife, &s;o &s;oon &s;natched away from my enraptured eyes&mdash;perhaps from my growing affection. My young &s;pou&s;e is now no more&mdash;one of the world's faire&s;t ornaments has been a mere ha&s;ty pa&s;&s;enger through it. Alas! it has appeared but a moment to leave a more la&s;ting remembrance of it, like a ro&s;e which we have &s;een in a fine vernal morning, ready to unfold its beau|ties to the &s;un, who&s;e fleeting lu&s;tre and tran&s;itory graces we remember with livelie&s;t regret in the winter, whil&s;t &s;urrounded with ice and &s;now. I mourn her rare attractions forever lo&s;t; but the mo&s;t la&s;ting &s;orrow I &s;hall feel, will not be on ac|count of her youth, talents, nor peri&s;hable beauty, but the train of amiable and &s;ub&s;tantial virtues, who&s;e germ was implanted in her heart. I mar|ried her precipitately, without knowing her cha|racter and di&s;po&s;ition. But whil&s;t another po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es you, ah! how long a time would be requi&s;ite for making another choice &s;o good as the one I lately made! I cannot but weep! Deign to think, Eleanor, that there are &s;ome misfortunes &s;o great as to van|qui&s;h the greate&s;t fortitude&mdash;deign to think that Bovile's &s;ituation requires the con&s;olations of friend&s;hip!</P>

<P>INDEED, Murville, I cannot tell what to think of your &s;ublime non&s;en&s;e! A dear brother call|ed from the fleet&mdash;a rival in the fleet&mdash;a girl e&s;cap|ed! May heaven confound me if I under&s;tand a word of all this!</P>
<P>Your Mademoi&s;elle de Terville has many tribu|lations and fears. So much the wor&s;e for her. Does &s;he have more comfortable nights? Does her appetite return? So much the better for you. Do all you can and all you plea&s;e with her health and graces, it will divert me; and the devil take me if this is not the fir&s;t time I have heard any thing about her.</P>
<P>To continue: my great frankne&s;s, Sir, will not, in this matter, nor any other, have any thing to do with your dull impertinence. I have told you a thou&s;and times before, and now tell you &s;eriou&s;ly, that you make u&s;e of language &s;o in&s;ulting that I &s;hall not put up with it. Upon the whole, Mur|ville, it &s;eems you have written to me, I know not from whence, &s;everal letters before the&s;e I have received, which have not come to hand, and I con|&s;ider it of little con&s;equence whether they do or not.</P>

<P>AHA! you di&s;own the pretty girl, and are affronted. You are then more in love than I apprehended. That you are in love, I can ea&s;ily divine, for I who am writing to you, am often ready to yield to its influence my&s;elf. Excellent per&s;on! how much more &s;hould I be plea&s;ed with her &s;in|cere and mode&s;t airs, if they gave le&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s? And &s;ince &s;he &s;eems &s;o affected with my careful attention, &s;o charmed with the lea&s;t re&s;pect &s;hown her, how can I tell her that I am di&s;intere&s;ted? It would be much more agreeable to hear her &s;peak of her gratitude, if &s;he did not accompany the ex|pre&s;&s;ion with a&s;&s;urances of her e&s;teem. This begins to bear hard upon me; for the e&s;teem of an inno|cent girl is to me an intolerable burden; and &s;he is, I believe, as perfect a picture of innocence as I am of libertini&s;m.</P>
<P>When I am not in her pre&s;ence, I come to my|&s;elf and return to my natural feelings; and in order to reduce my adver&s;ary, form admirable projects; projects &s;ometimes &s;o violent as would become a character like yours: but let her come into my &s;ight, and I &s;tand confounded in the unactive con|templation of her charms. Her charms, which even now, in the beginning of her convale&s;cence, are &s;uperior to the va&s;t idea I had formed of them! I &s;tand &s;truck with amazement, view and admire her, but can proceed no further!</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="035743_0068_1006ACE3B8E92338">But of what can I accu&s;e my&s;elf? Is there at pre|&s;ent any thing better to be done? The time for en|terpri&s;es mo&s;t certainly is not yet come. To attack her now would be the wrong way of obtaining her affections&mdash;this would be no better than downright violation.</P>
<P>I cannot deny that her pre&s;ence confounds me: &s;he &s;peaks only, and I am di&s;concerted: &s;he looks at me, and I am melted into tenderne&s;s; the agita|tion of my thoughts is in&s;tantly di&s;&s;ipated; I no longer feel any other than tho&s;e &s;illy emotions, the emotions which come from the heart. What an enchantre&s;s! How ea&s;ily are the mo&s;t ardent pa&s;&s;ions calmed by the accents of her &s;weet voice! What bold re&s;olutions are vanqui&s;hed by her timid looks! In &s;hort, how powerful is her weakne&s;s!</P>
<P>Good God! what have I been writing! it frightens me. Hah, it is done! it is all over with me! undone forever! I have become&mdash;amorous; in love after the manner of certain folks who&s;e &s;ituation has often excited my mirth&punc; Soon, with|out doubt, &s;oon &s;hall I be reduced to the ble&s;t con|dition of tho&s;e amu&s;ing gentlemen whom we have often &s;een, and for a long time, dying with Platonic love: going perpetually from door to door, boa&s;t|ing of the innocence, &s;everity and cha&s;tity of their mi&s;tre&s;s to every per&s;on they meet.</P>
<P>O no, Mademoi&s;elle, no! you &s;hall love after my fa&s;hion; if you don't, zounds! you &s;hall go to M. de Varmont again; he'll attack you in a &s;oft, polite and delicate manner, and will not &s;hrink from your prudi&s;h airs.</P>
<P>In fact, I wonder at my&s;elf! what needle&s;s blot|ting, what wa&s;ting of paper is this! when I fir&s;t began I intended to an&s;wer your harmle&s;s epi&s;tle in a word or two. Now I am not &s;urpri&s;ed that you

pretended, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, not to under&s;tand my late letter; my valet, a Briton blockhead, who took charge of my di&s;patches at Chateaulin, in&s;tead of carrying them to the po&s;t-office, took it in his head to go and treat his countrymen at the tavern; hav|ing ju&s;t felt in his pockets, I found my three fir&s;t letters again, and now &s;end them inclo&s;ed. Read them, my dear Sir, and you will find that Ma|demoi&s;elle de Terville is really an old acquaint|ance of your's, and that all di&s;&s;imulation on your part will be fruitle&s;s. To conclude; I make no doubt, but after a little reflection, you will get rid of that fit of ill humour with which you was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed; but if, on the contrary, you determine to take the thing in earne&s;t, M. de Varmont, beware of taking needle&s;s trouble.</P>

<P>YES, 'tis Emilia who writes to you; Emilia, by a prodigy &s;natched from the mo&s;t threat|ening dangers.</P>
<P>You remember how I was terrified at the &s;ight of my brother, and &s;till more by your letter which informed me of his my&s;terious departure, and &s;carcely breathed before I went on board the &s;hip, which I con&s;idered to be the &s;afe&s;t of a&s;ylums. Sen&s;ele&s;s wretch! there it was that the &s;nares of death &s;urrounded me.</P>
<P>I &s;lept there, however&mdash;but oh, with what &s;leep! what dreams di&s;turbed my repo&s;e! an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in hold|ing

his naked &s;word at my brea&s;t, demanded my life and inheritance. It was the young man I &s;aw in Bre&s;t; but I was no longer deceived by the fal&s;e colour of his hair; it was red; his hands al&s;o&mdash; merciful God! his murderous hands were &s;tained with my blood!</P>
<P>On a &s;udden I was awaked by a frightful tu|mult, and beheld the &s;hip in flames; I called aloud for Bovile, but he could neither hear nor a&s;&s;i&s;t me. My fear increa&s;ing as fa&s;t as the rapid conflagra|tion, in order to e&s;cape the flames I fell into the &s;ea. The &s;ea in great commotion rolled with boi&s;terous waves; often was I plunged as it were to the bot|tom of the deep, and as often rai&s;ed again to the &s;urface of the waters; at length being driven again&s;t a boat, I clung to it, and implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two men who were in it, but who were &s;carcely vi&s;ible, to take me in; one of them held out an a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand, the other&mdash;Oh, Celina! Celina! the pen falls from my trembling hand&mdash;the other&mdash; Ah, my &s;i&s;ter! for pity's &s;ake make me believe, that overpowered by a too real danger among&s;t the raging billows which re-demanded their prey, my imagination, tormented with di&s;mal forebodings, and harra&s;&s;ed with the ideas of my trouble&s;ome dream, has formed an imaginary enemy and unreal dangers. Strive to per&s;uade me, that though in the fearful di&s;order of my &s;en&s;es, I was not mi&s;|taken as to the frightful words I am going to relate. I might at lea&s;t have been deceived as to the ter|rible voice that uttered them. With trembling, my &s;i&s;ter, I confe&s;s that I recognized&mdash;I believe &mdash; I con&s;ent to &s;ay &s;o&mdash;that I recognized the voice of the hard-hearted young man who lately came &s;o often, in behalf of Madame de Varmont, to tell me that I al&s;o was born to die in the cloi&s;ter.
<PB N="75" REF="035743_0071_1006ACF004338FC0">
What I heard, and but too well under&s;tood, was, "What are you doing? Perhaps it is &s;he! pu&s;h her off! &s;trike her!" O my &s;i&s;ter, I hear tho&s;e dreadful words a thou&s;and times in a day! and in every interval of recollection the dreadful voice of Varmont re&s;ounds in my ears!</P>
<P>Believe me, Celina, however horrible my &s;u&s;|picions may appear, they are &s;o well founded that I &s;hall not be tempted to &s;eek further information. Ah! I be&s;eech you, let the execrable &s;ecret remain eternally between my &s;i&s;ter and me!</P>

<P>WELL, how fares it with you, my dear Dolerval! you have not written to me in
<PB N="76" REF="035743_0072_1006ACF5DBAB7348">
a long time. What has become of you? Will neither mu&s;ic, painting, geography, botany, nor a thou&s;and &s;imilar trifles, give you one moment of lea&s;ure? That I neglect you a little my&s;elf is a thing of cour&s;e, for I am con&s;tantly in pur&s;uit of com|mendable objects. At pre&s;ent I am peculiarly en|gaged, having now in my mind, and hoping &s;oon to have in my arms, the rare attractions of a young la&s;s about &s;ixteen.</P>
<P>How you would be charmed with the &s;weet creature! She &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s, in a &s;upreme degree, that precious &s;en&s;ibility which has &s;o tainted our unhappy &s;i&s;ter, and which you are &s;o abundantly full of your&s;elf&mdash;yes, you, my poor Dolerval, upon who&s;e beautiful countenance it may be &s;een at a mile's di&s;tance. Don't you know, my brother, that this effeminate tenderne&s;s of yours gives you an air of innocence that makes you look &s;hockingly? So &s;hockingly you look, that I am &s;ometimes forced to confe&s;s to my&s;elf that you mu&s;t have, in one re&s;pect, more &s;en&s;e than I have, or you could not, in &s;pite of that good natured mien, appear to have &s;o much &s;en&s;e remaining.</P>
<P>But let us return to the dear girl, for I &s;trive in vain to &s;peak of any thing el&s;e. Leap for joy, my brother! there is in the world one virtuous girl, and &s;o virtuous as to make one tremble on ap|proaching her. She is al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch un|common mode&s;ty that I cannot but laugh whil&s;t her pre&s;ence overawes me. Very ba&s;hful be&s;ides, as ba&s;hful as Dolerval by the &s;ide of a young girl! There is one thing between you and her, that puzzles me beyond mea&s;ure. How is it? Do you take it upon you to mimic her prudi&s;h airs, or has &s;he, on the contrary, really &s;tolen them from you? When I behold her I can &s;carcely per&s;uade my&s;elf
<PB N="77" REF="035743_0073_1006ACF9EDFCF300">
that I &s;ee any thing more than a copy; but when I reflect on the innocence of your manners, I tremble le&s;t &s;he may be the original in di&s;gui&s;e. It would be a fine affair to &s;ee you &s;ide by &s;ide! What an excellent &s;ubject for the imitation of a painter! Upon honor, Dolerval, &s;he was made for none but you, and if I were but a little le&s;s taken with her, I would &s;end her to you to-mor|row in the &s;tage.</P>
<P>But of this, my friend, there is no po&s;&s;ibility; for I find my&s;elf in &s;o good a way, and &s;o far ad|vanced in it, that I cannot &s;top. This morning I pre&s;umed to make her &s;ome propo&s;als. That &s;he was not &s;urpri&s;ed at them is very well; but I am very &s;orry &s;he was not offended, for I could much better re&s;i&s;t her anger, than overcome her mild confidence. Wor&s;e than this, &s;he turned my at|tention to noble &s;entiments, and talked in awful language. I acknowledged to her, that I had a great veneration for the &s;ublime virtues, confe&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, my inability of attaining to their heroi&s;m. But the pre&s;umptuous little creature fooli&s;hly replied, that &s;he had too much e&s;teem for me to de&s;pair of teaching me the practice of them. Tell me then, Dolerval, is wi&s;dom ingrafted by accident? You who are &s;o full of it mu&s;t certainly know.</P>
<P>But a little while ago I was &s;peaking of your innocence. What has become of it, Dolerval? What do you do with it? Excellent fellow! What a memorable example you will leave to the pre&s;ent corrupt generation!</P>
<P>The truth is, you are walking gravely along in the foot&s;teps of your romantic &s;i&s;ter! and as &s;he is al&s;o mine, I could wi&s;h for her own good to ad|vi&s;e her to change her cour&s;e. Let her learn then,
<PB N="78" REF="035743_0074_1006AD020E7942E0">
that when an old fellow marries a young woman, to bear his pocket expences, he mu&s;t expect to put up with the little inconveniences of matrimony: and provided his young wife be&s;tows on her old hu&s;band what little he &s;tands in need of, &s;he may in good con&s;cience di&s;po&s;e of the innocent but trouble&s;ome &s;uperfluity that remains&mdash;a &s;uperfluity which her bo&s;om friend has the privilege of u&s;ing or neglecting at his will. Tell her this from me&mdash; under&s;tand me&mdash;let her con&s;ider it well. It will happen very naturally, that Bovile, whom, upon your word, I believe to be very amiable, may, at his next return, become very happy. Old Florival will have nothing to lo&s;e by this arrangement, but his wife will have every thing to gain. Then &s;he will revive; then &s;he will leave off pining in &s;uch a pitiful manner. Let her determine upon it imme|diately. This &s;hould have been done &s;even years ago.</P>
<P>I am not going to for&s;ake you; upon you &s;hall I be lavi&s;h in be&s;towing good principles&mdash;Oh that &s;omebody would do the &s;ame by me! Give me your opinion, Dolerval, concerning the conduct I mu&s;t ob&s;erve towards Mademoi&s;elle de Terville. Let me &s;ee whether you advi&s;e me to u&s;e violent mea|&s;ures with her or not.</P>
<P>Give me your &s;entiments, Dolerval, I be&s;eech you. Varmont will &s;oon give me his in writing. Take care that his letter does not come before yours. He will advi&s;e me to try my &s;trength with her; but you will coun&s;el me to effeminate behaviour. What &s;hall I do in &s;uch ca&s;e? I will tell you. Wi&s;dom repo&s;es in the medium of two extremes. I &s;hall vigorou&s;ly pu&s;h forwards then towards happi|ne&s;s, which is the eternal goal of wi&s;dom. And when the medium has given me complete &s;atisfac|tion,
<PB N="79" REF="035743_0075_1006AD0954A24D88">
I &s;hall impudently tell Varmont he was a villain for his advice, and you, Dolerval, a poor &s;impleton for yours.</P>
<P>Farewell, my dear young brother; accept the a&s;&s;urances of my kind attachment to you, and pre|&s;ent them to my &s;i&s;ter. You are both of &s;uch an extraordinary make, that at times I cannot refrain from laughing at you. Neverthele&s;s, you may be a&s;&s;ured that I love you with the tendere&s;t affection.</P>

<P>HAVING recovered a little more &s;trength, I am going to mention more concerning the crimes of which I began a relation. Recover yours al&s;o, that you may have fortitude &s;ufficient to hear it.</P>
<P>The barbarian who pronounced the &s;entence of death upon me, finding his accomplice, le&s;s unmer|ciful than he was, delaying the execution of it, ro&s;e up and &s;tood in the po&s;ture of &s;triking me him|&s;elf. I had a glimp&s;e of an arm or &s;omething rai&s;ed over me, and thought it nece&s;&s;ary to quit my hold of the boat; and in order to &s;ave my life from the fury of a barbarian, once more to commit it to the raging waves, which were le&s;s void of pity than lie. Being not far from the &s;hore, I was driven again&s;t it by one wave, and carried back by another, till at length I was ca&s;t upon it almo&s;t lifele&s;s. In immi|nent danger nature is capable of wonderful efforts. De&s;titute of &s;trength as I was, I found it not im|po&s;&s;ible

<P>YOU are ever the &s;ame, Murville. What need was there of &s;ub&s;cribing your letter when you are &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;covered by your &s;tile? Your &s;atirical epi&s;tle was at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;omewhat amu&s;ing; but the &s;erious commentary upon it, given by Eleanor, mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected me. The &s;entiments of my &s;i&s;ter are totally different from yours. Her powers of per&s;ua&s;ion have much
<PB N="81" REF="035743_0077_1006AE04C9A34518">
greater influence upon me than your &s;atirical let|ters.</P>
<P>You &s;eem to take plea&s;ure in laughing at my &s;en&s;ibility. Are you not &s;en&s;ible, then, that from this &s;ource I derive my &s;weete&s;t enjoyments? It is this which attaches to my innocent &s;tudies an in|finite charm. It is this which invites me to de|lightful reveries among&s;t our &s;miling meadows and fields. Were I de&s;titute of this I could not take delight in weeping with compa&s;&s;ion in the cottage of the unfortunate. Without this I &s;hould not &s;o often mingle my tears with tho&s;e of my &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e &s;ecret &s;orrows have &s;ometimes been &s;oothed by me. Can even the plea&s;ures you boa&s;t of be much more enlivening than the&s;e? You will, in the end, find them to be far le&s;s durable, and, depend upon it, you are making way for long and &s;evere repent|ance.</P>
<P>My unhappy &s;i&s;ter is now con&s;uming with grief. M. Bovile, whom it is de&s;irable you might have known&mdash;M. Bovile, who, by a long &s;eparation from her, has not been rendered le&s;s dear, has lately married the &s;i&s;ter of a man who&s;e friend you cannot long remain. What is then this pa&s;&s;ion of love that can &s;o much di&s;turb the pure&s;t and calm|e&s;t &s;ouls, and change the mo&s;t excellent of cha|racters! What is it but this fatal pa&s;&s;ion which, even in the heart of Eleanor, re&s;embles envy? Alas! my &s;i&s;ter cannot bear that another &s;hould enjoy the object &s;he cannot obtain!</P>
<P>You con&s;ult me in &s;uch a manner re&s;pecting the conduct you &s;hould ob&s;erve towards Mademoi|&s;elle de Terville, as to acquit me from giving you the mo&s;t indirect advice. You &s;hall, however, be told, that had it been my good fortune to be in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch an angel as you de&s;cribed, I &s;hould

Then, with a timid and re&s;pectful deportment, I &s;hould endeavour, in her company, to avoid every thing which might give her the lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, and, by every re&s;pectful attention, endeavour to gain her affections. Per|haps I might then &s;ucceed in obtaining a lover, an idolized wife&mdash;and my &s;i&s;ter a tender, compa&s;&s;ion|ate friend! O that this may one day be the lot of your then mo&s;t fortunate brother&mdash;of him who would then be the happie&s;t of men!</P>

<P>MY misfortunes were not &s;o &s;oon to be ter|minated. I was re&s;erved to endure, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t grievous pains of body, and mo&s;t dreadful anxieties of mind. Judge how great was my angui&s;h, when, on coming to my&s;elf, I heard &s;omebody near the bed where I lay di&s;tinct|ly pronounce the name of a dete&s;table per&s;on who&s;e name was lately my own. I was apprehen&s;ive that I had fallen into the power of my enemy. The parching fever with which I was &s;eized be|came more ardent, and in a long delirium which it occa&s;ioned, my a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;eemed to threaten me with both ge&s;tures and voice. At one time (and I &s;hall long pre&s;erve the plea&s;ing remembrance of it)
<PB N="83" REF="035743_0079_1006AE0DA95F6E40">
&s;ome per&s;on, as I thought, mentioned the name of Bovile. I flattered my&s;elf that my deliverer was at hand, and expected an immediate relief from all my &s;orrows. Alas! I learned but too &s;oon that the fleet had &s;ailed; that the young man who had taken me into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was an intimate friend of Varmont, and I was ready to die with de&s;pair.</P>
<P>What cour&s;e to take in &s;uch critical circum|&s;tances I knew not. To give an account of my misfortunes, and reveal my name, would have the &s;ame con&s;equences as a particular indication of Varmont's crimes. Pre&s;umptions might lead to ab|&s;olute proofs, and you know what a dreadful fate awaits the guilty in in&s;tances of this kind. It is true that I &s;hould run a great hazard in concealing the&s;e circum&s;tances from him, although I am not under any obligation to let him know them. But would it not be equally, if not more dangerous, to make my&s;elf known? What rea&s;ons could I give &s;ufficiently plau&s;ible, to per&s;uade this friend of Varmont not to inform him that his &s;i&s;ter had ju&s;t e&s;caped from &s;hipwreck? Was it then advi&s;able to let him have a glimp&s;e of my fearful &s;tory? The advantage of greater per&s;onal &s;afety could never incline me to do this, for I have &s;uppo&s;ed the more heinous the crime, the more I &s;hould &s;trive to cover it with an impenetrable and my&s;terious veil. Why &s;hould I run the ri&s;k of falling a victim hereafter to a pardon too generou&s;ly granted? Therefore, in order to remove every &s;u&s;picion, I tried every means of deception. I told the young man who found me, that I was a girl; that my name was Terville; that I mourned the ab&s;ence of a dear brother who went away in the fleet. A dear brother! Ju&s;t heaven! why did&s;t thou not give me one that I could forbear hating? To

conclude; I permitted this &s;tranger, into who&s;e power I had fallen, to believe, as he already did, that Varmont became an object of my aver&s;ion by pur&s;uing me with a criminal pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>THAT you need the <HI>con&s;olations of friend|&s;hip,</HI> Bovile, is undeniable; but why did you &s;olicit them in &s;uch a cruel manner?

<P>YOU &s;hall now, my dear Celina, be informed of my real &s;ituation, and what are my de|&s;igns. My hu&s;band's character was too well known to me to give me any rea&s;on for believing his &s;peedy departure to be occa&s;ioned by indiffer|ence. I make no doubt but Bovile has &s;incerely mourned for me, whom he believes forever lo&s;t. Yet how could he, let his grief be ever &s;o great, delay his departure on an expedition which he ex|pected would greatly contribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of the French arms? He never entertained a &s;ingle thought of delay when the intere&s;t of his country required his departure. Bovile is not a man who would &s;tand rea&s;oning with his duty. For my part, as &s;oon as my health becomes le&s;s langui&s;hing, I purpo&s;e to go to Bre&s;t, in order to embark there for the We&s;t-Indies. M. Murville, I am &s;ure, will not refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in going thither. The fleet was to put in at Martinique, and it will not be difficult, I &s;uppo&s;e, to rejoin my hu&s;band at that place. There &s;hall I bid defiance to the dark de|&s;igns of Varmont: for he doubtle&s;s, by this time, entertains &s;u&s;picions of my being alive. M. Mur|ville was too ha&s;ty in telling his friend his late ad|venture of finding a young woman dying not far from the &s;hores of Bre&s;t. But if I may give credit to what M. Murville has told me, my enemy is, at lea&s;t, unacquainted with the place of my retreat.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="035743_0082_1006AE19CE5ACA18">There is one circum&s;tance of which I had forgot to inform you, which adds much to the difficulty of my &s;ituation, which already has become ex|tremely perplexing. This young man is a liber|tine in &s;entiment, and has already made me &s;ome propo&s;als that alarmed me. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that ap|pearances &s;eem to be again&s;t me, and may be plead as a palliation of his in&s;ulting behaviour. The my&s;terious circum&s;tances attending all the events of my misfortunes before he found me, have, ac|cording to my relation of them, given a va&s;t &s;cope to his imagination. Nor can he be fully &s;atisfied, although he knows me to be young, and may think me &s;omewhat hand&s;ome, what tho&s;e attempts of Varmont were which have rendered him &s;o odious in my &s;ight. But methinks this young man &s;hould &s;hew more regard for my misfortunes, let him at|tribute them to any cau&s;e whatever. Although I might excu&s;e him for conceiving a favourable opinion of me, and, &s;ince he knows me &s;o little, for entertaining an affection for me, yet never can I pardon him for attempting to take an ill advantage of an unhappy woman accidentally put into his power.</P>

<P>SCARCELY had my letter gone out of my hands, than I repented that I wrote it. Do not, my friend, attribute the ill natured &s;entiments it contained to any thing but vexation for the lo&s;s I have met with. I could not believe the young girl you &s;poke of had fallen into your hands; but &s;uppo&s;ed you had been informed of my bad luck by the indi&s;cretion of &s;ome friends, and was making your&s;elf merry at my expence. This was the rea|&s;on why I was in a pa&s;&s;ion, as I confe&s;s I was, and am &s;orry for it.</P>
<P>The letters which I have all at once received from you, have well convinced me, that I ought to di&s;&s;emble no longer. Hear, then, a confe&s;&s;ion which I was a&s;hamed to make.

<P>HEAR me, Murville: this is not the fir&s;t time I have had rea&s;on to admire your penetra|tion.

been heard to &s;ay that it was a &s;illy piece of bu&s;i|ne&s;s in old M. de Varmont to put him in the navy. To put a raw, unexperienced fellow in the royal navy, is like leaving a beautiful woman in a fore&s;t to be protected by chance.</P>
<P>To complete the calamity, it happens that the &s;ame cur&s;ed frigate which drowned my &s;i&s;ter's lover, has al&s;o drowned the brother of my mi&s;tre&s;s. Poor Mademoi&s;elle de Terville! how could I be &s;o be&s;ide my&s;elf as to interrogate the infernal me&s;&s;enger in her hearing? In &s;uch &s;ort have I in|terrogated him, that one has fainted away, and is waiting for you to bear the deadly me&s;&s;age to the other.</P>
<P>Dolerval, 'tis a &s;ad commi&s;&s;ion which I give you; and although you mu&s;t perform it, you would be but little better than a murderer if you &s;hould perform it abruptly. You mu&s;t therefore exerci&s;e di&s;cretion when you go to her with this fatal me&s;|&s;age, and gradually prepare her for the completion of her mi&s;ery. But &s;ee now! the&s;e are the &s;weet fruits of that thing called virtue, with which &s;he was &s;o infatuated! Had your &s;i&s;ter, in&s;tead of &s;igh|ing and pining away during &s;even long and tedious years with an u&s;ele&s;s flame, during only as many weeks &s;et apart a few minutes in gratifying it, &s;he might either have totally extingui&s;hed it, or greatly dimini&s;hed its force. For &s;ay what you will, you &s;en&s;ible folks mu&s;t pardon me, when I tell you that the wounds of Cupid are not incurable, pro|vided the patient di&s;dains not the nece&s;&s;ary remedies to heal them, when well under&s;tood. Had Eleanor taken this method, Bovile might have taken leave of her, and &s;he would have taken no more than ordinary notice of it; or, if the ob&s;tinate mi&s;tre&s;s could not but lay it to heart&mdash;alas! are there no

more young men upon earth? And if they cannot be &s;erviceable in running to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of afflict|ed widows, what are they good for? And if a &s;core of them will not &s;uffice, perhaps a hundred will be &s;ufficient, and they are ea&s;ily to be obtained. Were this method once put in practice, you would find that the &s;orrows of a woman are not &s;o incon&s;ola|ble as you have been plea&s;ed to imagine; and that none of them are &s;o la&s;ting and &s;evere as not to be overcome by a rea&s;onable number of con&s;ola|tions. But the &s;ituation of our Eleanor has be|come &s;o de&s;perate, that I am reduced to the nece&s;|&s;ity of giving her no comforter but you. O wretched alternative!</P>
<P>But I have heard a piece of intelligence which puts me more out of humour than all other ad|ver&s;ities &s;addled upon me at once. You doubtle&s;s remember that pretty girl, Dolerval&mdash;that little angel, as you called her&mdash;that little angel of &s;uch mode&s;t deportment, &s;uch timid looks and cha&s;te mien, that I really believed &s;he was a maid? No &s;uch thing, Dolerval! the agreeable news has ju&s;t arrived by the po&s;t. Now tell me, credulous fel|low, what female countenance we may henceforth believe in. How it vexes me! How it enrages me! Ah, M. de Varmont is the only one who can feel well!</P>

11 o'clock at night.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AT length I am left alone&mdash;at length I am at liberty freely to weep and complain. To this paper do I commit the relation of my new af|flictions, which I hope, at &s;ome future time, may reveal to you every &s;evere incident of my fate.</P>
<P>There was but one &s;upport re&s;erved for me on earth. That &s;upport, O Celina, which was a hope of Bovile's protection, is, by his death, irre|coverably lo&s;t! Perhaps the con&s;ideration alone of the circum&s;tances in which I am left by his mis|fortunes, might excu&s;e me for being mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected with my own. Perhaps it might be thought, that becau&s;e I had been with him but &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace, and was, by his untimely death, delivered into the power of my enemies, I had therefore le&s;s rea&s;on to lament the lo&s;s of him as my hu&s;band, than as my protector. But the benevolent and nobly generous Bovile required but a &s;hort ac|quaintance to affect my heart with the warme&s;t gratitude and mo&s;t tender e&s;teem. And how readily adver&s;ity enables us to form an opinion of man|kind! The &s;i&s;ter of Varmont, and pri&s;oner of Mur|ville, has little rea&s;on to believe that there are many who po&s;&s;e&s;s amiable qualities, and much rea&s;on to believe that &s;he will forever deplore her recent lo&s;s. But &s;o great are my pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ments, that
<PB N="96" REF="035743_0092_1006AE4423FB0770">
they affect me almo&s;t as &s;en&s;ibly as my regret for the lo&s;s of Bovile. What, O Celina, will become of thy &s;i&s;ter? Per&s;ecuted by the hatred of Madame de Varmont, and narrowly e&s;caped from the fury of her &s;on; a widow almo&s;t as &s;oon as married; doomed by hard fortune to conceal from all &s;he is connected with, the name of her family and that of her hu&s;band; without any re&s;ource, without &s;trength or experience&mdash;What then can &s;he do with the fatal liberty which remains? Alas! would it not have been better to have remained with thee in perpetual confinement?</P>
<P>But I was &s;peaking of remaining liberty, whil&s;t I do not enjoy any! This M. de Murville &s;o far abu&s;es the weakne&s;s of my &s;ex, and takes &s;uch ad|vantage of my unfortunate &s;ituation, as to keep me in confinement. Neverthele&s;s, I entertain hopes that the omnipotent Pre&s;erver of men, who pities the oppre&s;&s;ed, has not wre&s;ted me from the hands of a parricide to abandon me to the de&s;igns of an impious man. Let my &s;trength be re&s;tored, and I &s;hall elude the vigilance of my tyrant. I &s;hall make all &s;uitable inquiries and obtain all po&s;&s;ible information nece&s;&s;ary to my e&s;cape. Alas! was there but one virtuous man upon earth? Mu&s;t I never meet with another Bovile? Although I would not &s;olicit the di&s;graceful pity of any per&s;on, I ought not a&s;&s;uredly to blu&s;h when imploring relief from the truly benevolent. Is it not probable that I might find means of &s;upporting my&s;elf by hand labour as many others have done before me? The meane&s;t employment in hand labour, I am confident, would not di&s;courage me. My courage would enable me to undertake it, and habit would render it &s;upport|able: &s;o that, at length, I &s;hould be capable of en|during every thing, except the di&s;grace of leaving

the paths of virtue. Be calm, my &s;i&s;ter; a ray of hope has again enlightened and cheered my &s;oul, and whatever event may take place, my fortitude &s;hall not for&s;ake me.</P>

<P>OH, Varmont! have you really had the har|dine&s;s of profaning &s;o many charms? Alas! could not her timid mode&s;ty, native re&s;erve, nor

This was no time for prayers and tears, young woman! you &s;hould pinch, &s;cratch, bite, cry, and even &s;wear! you &s;hould have raved and torn like a little fury! you &s;hould&mdash;you &s;hould have rather died than endure all this!&mdash;But, Mademoi&s;elle, you proceed no further than crying and be&s;eeching! you are then but a little fool with your large cunning eyes. But what do I &s;ay? I ought to blame none but the &s;avage Varmont. You only are to blame. What feeble re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t the frail creature make again&s;t &s;uch a power|ful enemy! You have overpowered, cru&s;hed, a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated her, in the true &s;en&s;e of the word a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate! This was downright wilful murder. Poor girl! charming creature!&mdash;When I view her more at|tentively, and figure to my&s;elf your contemptible per&s;on in her arms, it &s;ets me in a rage! At &s;uch a time I would re&s;tore her to you for nothing. But, at the &s;ame time, I would willingly fall on my own &s;word for the opportunity of plunging it into your heart.</P>
<P>From &s;uch men as you there is nothing to be expected but violence and dark deeds. You com|mand, when you ought to &s;olicit: in&s;tead of ob|taining by per&s;ua&s;ion, you wre&s;t by violence: me|ritorious behaviour with a witne&s;s! The lowe&s;t bred fellow in the kingdom can do it as well as you.</P>
<P>But to &s;often the &s;orrow of a &s;weet girl in order to lull it to &s;leep; to flatter her &s;elf-love in order to lead it a&s;tray&mdash;her prejudices for the purpo&s;e of de|&s;troying them; to prai&s;e her virtue with a de&s;ign of rendering it le&s;s rigid; to excite her gratitude by pretended benefits&mdash;her love by a feigned &s;en&s;ibility&mdash; her confidence by a well &s;upported, re&s;pectful be|haviour

This is what I now undertake, and what I call the ma&s;|ter-piece of the art.</P>
<P>This I am &s;en&s;ible will not &s;oon be effected; but, upon reflection, I find that I &s;hall have &s;uffi|cient lei&s;ure for that purpo&s;e. I have already too much worn out my youth with ordinary intrigues. At pre&s;ent I am willing to repo&s;e in the languors of an engagement half &s;erious. I &s;hall attempt to feel a &s;ort of pa&s;&s;ion. What a glorious reward &s;hall I receive for my labours! Never was there a more commendable attempt, nor any attempt ever made upon a more excellent object!</P>
<P>You may therefore be convinced, that if you &s;hould &s;end your tru&s;ty foot-boy again, he will take a mo&s;t fruitle&s;s journey. I cannot give up my precious trea&s;ure. Methinks I hear you cry out, What, what are your rea&s;ons for detaining her? You &s;ay, that you &s;tand in need of her. Ah! your nece&s;&s;ities are the nece&s;&s;ities of nature! Fie upon you! it is morally impo&s;&s;ible for me to forego the privilege. You are much taken with her, you &s;ay. What of that? I am an hundred times more &s;o than your&s;elf. I am inflamed by the pa&s;&s;ion with which &s;he in&s;pires me, and which &s;he is cal|culated to in&s;pire. You have, in the end of your extraordinary epi&s;tle, endeavoured to claim her as your property. I tell you it is fal&s;e. Is it ever

<P>No, no, M. de Varmont! you pray in vain; conjure, a&s;k pardon, and exerci&s;e every mean art as much as you plea&s;e, it is a &s;ettled point that you will not have her again.</P>
<P>To conclude; expecting I &s;hall be at lei&s;ure to an&s;wer all the in&s;ignificant que&s;tions with which you may plea&s;e to vex me, I con&s;ent to receive your apologies, and will &s;toop to hear your ex|pre&s;&s;ions of reverence for Murville. However, when you deign to acknowledge him &s;uperior to Varmont, I cannot tell whether you mean it for a compliment or not. Be it as it may, I can freely indulge you in &s;uch an employment; but as to the pretty girl, I &s;hall keep her my&s;elf.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the ridiculous di&s;gui&s;e of your valet, &s;he &s;eemed to know him, and &s;he filled the ca&s;tle with her cries. The amiable girl embraced my knees.

unnece&s;&s;ary. Her better friend could not obtain her.

Like the Roman who carried peace and war in the &s;kirt of his gown. M. Lafleur haughtily turned his pockets&mdash;when lo! a flood of plagues &s;uddenly i&s;&s;ued from it, in the form of a challenge in your hand writing! At fir&s;t I received your manife&s;to with becoming re&s;pect; but your me&s;&s;enger growing rather too in&s;olent. I threatened to commence ho&s;tilities, and intended to put the diplomatic &s;pectre gently out of the window. For|tunately for him, a word from the girl was &s;uffi|cient to put him to flight. She cried out, Mon|&s;ter! if you are not gone in an in&s;tant, I will di&s;|cover all! And in an in&s;tant the mon&s;ter left us.</P>
<P>After he was gone, and I had a little recovered from my fright, I read your billet over and over again. Your billet tells me, Varmont, that you have become very crazy or very crafty. Crazy, if you are willing to expo&s;e your&s;elf &s;o far for the little girl as to lo&s;e your ears in a quarrel with your be&s;t friend: crafty, indeed, if you propo&s;e our meeting on the frontiers of the country, with a de|&s;ign of removing me from the object of my de&s;ires. However it may be, I hold my&s;elf in readine&s;s to+ward off every danger. I &s;hall ob&s;tinately defend at home the trea&s;ure with which I &s;hould part more reluctantly than ever. If, on your part, you per&s;i&s;t in your de&s;ign of getting her away, come your&s;elf, my friend, come to me. You will find Murville waiting for you, and that with firmne&s;s. By this means we &s;hall each of us play our own part. It belongs not to the man who is a&s;&s;aulted, to go from his place.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="035743_0098_1006AE658F4FB550">However, if you are willing to hear good ad|vice, Varmont, &s;tay at home. Beware of coming even to the end of my green plot, to defy my valour. Although I am &s;en&s;ible that you are celebrated in the art of fencing, I can tell you, without a&s;&s;uming the &s;tyle of a braggadocio, that I am &s;omewhat re|nowned for it my&s;elf. Li&s;ten, my friend; all the &s;ubjects of our temper are obliged to end their quarrels by the &s;word. And if we were to be guided in this matter by nothing but the chivalrous honor, about which we make &s;o much noi&s;e, fencing would &s;oon become a trifling and de&s;pi|cable amu&s;ement. In order to give it all its due merit, let us con&s;ider it in every advantageous point of view. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here Murville makes a di&s;tinction between the common people, who were often puni&s;hed by the laws in ca&s;e of a quarrel between them and the nobility, who were above the laws.

Indeed, it is very de&s;irable that we &s;hould occa&s;ionally have it in our power to addre&s;s a man who &s;hould be tempted to re&s;i&s;t and make any noi&s;e in &s;uch language as follows:</P>
<P>"I confe&s;s, Mon&s;ieur, that I have knavi&s;hly won your money in gaming; that I have publicly in|&s;ulted your wife at the ball&mdash;&s;educed your daughter &mdash;run away with your &s;i&s;ter. Be&s;ides, I have in|&s;ulted you, and publi&s;hed you for a coward; and now I am going to cuff your ears and handle you as I plea&s;e, and if you don't take it all in good part I will kill you."</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="035743_0099_1006AE671E3F5CC8">We mu&s;t, therefore, allow it to be, for our pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion, an excellent invention, that what places prejudices in oppo&s;ition to laws&punc; and allows force to &s;uper&s;ede authority, allows us, at the &s;ame time, to di&s;pen&s;e with having virtue and politene&s;s, provided we are furni&s;hed with a &s;word. You, therefore, do very well to &s;trut about with yours; and if you follow my arguments to the extent of their rigour, I am willing to confe&s;s that you may e&s;teem it more formidable than that of Murville. But I would advi&s;e you to keep a good look out. When, by your per&s;ua&s;ions, I fir&s;t ventured into the high road of libertini&s;m, I thought within my&s;elf that I might, one day perhaps, enter al&s;o into that of vice, by your example; and, &s;hould the devil tempt me to do it, I might, in the end, &s;urpa&s;s even you in wickedne&s;s. In con&s;equence of this con|jecture, I took my mea&s;ures accordingly. Believe me, Varmont, you had better re&s;erve your intre|pidity for a le&s;s doubtful occa&s;ion. Among&s;t pi|rates there is nothing to be gained but hard &s;trokes.</P>
<P>Above all things, don't &s;end Lafleur again. On his own account, he has little rea&s;on for caring to return; and for my own part, I &s;hall be well con|tented to &s;ee him no more. The young girl had, before this time, frequently demanded her liberty; and &s;ince the journey of your lackey has threaten|ed her with a journey to her ma&s;ter, &s;he has re|doubled her importunity. Surpri&s;ing! could you have believed &s;he would try to get out, and at the &s;ame way your amba&s;&s;ador had like to have gone ye&s;terday? This I thought fit to oppo&s;e. The leap from the window, which, had it been perform|ed by the gro&s;s fellow, would have amu&s;ed me, appeared too dangerous for the little girl. For this rea&s;on I ordered all the windows of her apartment
<PB N="104" REF="035743_0100_1006AE6D46076178">
to be fa&s;tened with grates: and, in return for this kindne&s;s, &s;he calls me a tyrant. So that my bu&s;i|ne&s;s, in&s;tead of being advanced, is likely to be re|tarded. Varmont, let me alone; as you cannot prevent my happine&s;s, do not &s;trive to procure the malicious con&s;olation of delaying it. This would be mi&s;erable! O! I be&s;eech you, leave me in peace, and do not &s;end any more that de&s;picable Lafleur!</P>
<P>If he dares to make his appearance again, I tell you beforehand, he &s;hall not leave my ca&s;tle until he has confe&s;&s;ed all that the young girl, when out of her &s;en&s;es, was going to di&s;cover: and unle&s;s your wi&s;e confident prevents it by his flight, you may depend upon it he will be forced to make the confe&s;&s;ion which he was &s;o much afraid of making ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, Varmont, it is of it&s;elf &s;omething of an exploit to do violence to a girl; but it often happens, that an action, though commendable in it&s;elf, is attended with an infinity of circum&s;tances which con&s;pire to render it meritorious in the ex|treme. Every thing combines to per&s;uade me that, in your affair with Mademoi&s;elle de Terville, the manner of the tran&s;action was worthy of its begin|ning. It &s;eems that you have even outdone your|&s;elf; for in your la&s;t letter, a letter &s;o poorly cal|culated to enlighten me, with a world of inclo&s;ures equally in&s;ignificant, wherein the art which at|tempts to &s;eem like nature, is di&s;coverable in every line; there was not, I &s;ay, in all this confu&s;ed ma&s;s of wa&s;te-paper, a &s;ingle word to convince me of the &s;incerity of your declaration, that you would make me acquainted with this new my&s;tery of ini|quity. Do not oblige me to &s;earch into it. Al|though you are much younger than I, you have
<PB N="105" REF="035743_0101_1006AE6EDAD6E920">
given me &s;uch frightful examples in the high road I &s;poke of before, that your di&s;ciple cannot learn to follow them. Varmont; Varmont, leave me in peace, I be&s;eech you, and do not &s;end any more that hateful Lafleur!</P>

In truth, I find it to be coming on me again in earne&s;t. It incommodes me greatly, e&s;pe|cially when I am near the hand&s;ome girl I told you of. In her pre&s;ence, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;everal &s;ighs have e&s;caped me. In her pre&s;ence my coun|tenance lo&s;es its wonted gaiety, and has every ap|pearance of a man attacked with your malady. The cunning girl ob&s;erves my hard ta&s;k, and en|deavours to take the advantage of me. She im|proves this opportunity of praying me to &s;et her at liberty. I do not know whether I told you of it, but I keep the little enchantre&s;s under lock and key. Methinks I now hear you exclaiming again&s;t me! Well, what &s;urer method could you propo&s;e for keeping an angel again&s;t her will? To return to my &s;ubject: &s;he a&s;ks, and I refu&s;e. Then, with a tone &s;till &s;ofter and milder, &s;he &s;upplicates me &s;o feelingly, that your tender-hearted brother is almo&s;t overcome. Let a &s;ingle tear fall from her eye, and my own are ready to be moi&s;tened al&s;o! Al|though I cannot but confe&s;s that I &s;ometimes derive &s;ome plea&s;ure from this condition, yet, upon a little reflection, it di&s;quiets me and makes me angry with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>However, if the girl continues to make me &s;o di&s;tracted, it is a wonder if I do not, on &s;ome fa|vourable occa&s;ion, a&s;&s;ume courage enough to &s;horten the adventure and fini&s;h the romance.</P>

<P>I WAS certain of it. Nor was there any room for doubt. But why was you &s;o wavering, when you had ju&s;t &s;een and heard for your&s;elf? What good effect could it have for you to conceal your&s;elf in the neighbourhood, and there remain idle? You a&s;k for new in&s;tructions! Did I not give you every needful in&s;truction before your depar|ture? Did I not fore&s;ee the embarra&s;&s;ment in which you now find your&s;elf? The challenge, you may be certain, was &s;erious; with a de&s;ign of intimi|dating the man, as the la&s;t re&s;ort for bringing him to terms. Why did you, &s;eemingly, wait till I &s;hould go and expo&s;e my&s;elf by fighting with him? This would not be a good mea&s;ure till every other had proved ineffectual. We &s;hall, doubtle&s;s, ob|tain revenge for the ill treatment you received from him; but it is nece&s;&s;ary that the mo&s;t important part &s;hould be accompli&s;hed in the fir&s;t place.</P>
<P>If there were yet any rea&s;ons for he&s;itating about making the fir&s;t attempt, whil&s;t I am warned to make it by the anxiety which almo&s;t di&s;tracts me, perhaps I &s;hould he&s;itate my&s;elf. But can I at pre&s;ent neglect doing that for the more important concern of our common &s;efety, which, at fir&s;t, I attempted to do only to increa&s;e my fortune? Are you not &s;en&s;ible how frightful are tho&s;e words: "If you are not gone in an in&s;tant I will di&s;cover all?" O, &s;tupid fellow! how can they di&s;cover any thing

when they know nothing? What does it concern us if they have di&s;covered every thing? What mo&s;t concerns us is to order matters &s;o that they can never di&s;cover any thing again.</P>
<P>Proceed then&mdash;You are furni&s;hed with money and with arms. You &s;uppo&s;ed it an ea&s;y matter to effect the de&s;ign. Make ha&s;te; there is not a moment to lo&s;e.

<P>PITY me, Dolerval. What could even a man of &s;en&s;e do towards with&s;tanding the &s;nares and ambu&s;hes of a villain, or the tricks of an art|ful girl? There is nothing &s;o crafty as the former, nor any thing &s;o lucky as the latter. Which of them has corrupted my valet, I know not; but I know, to my &s;orrow, that the knave of a Marcel went away la&s;t night with my fair pri&s;oner, and &s;et her at liberty. From whence I conclude in my wi&s;dom, that either the ungrateful Mademoi&s;elle de Terville has intentionally fled, or the intriguing Varmont has found means to carry her off. In &s;uch a forlorn condition I &s;tand in need of all my gaiety. Cruel creature! How could &s;he thus for|&s;ake me? Never was there any event &s;o little cal|culated

<P>There is one circum&s;tance which hurts me. I have received orders from Bre&s;t to go thither im|mediately, and mu&s;t not fail. This makes me afraid I &s;hall be &s;ent away during the whole cam|paign. If &s;o, it will be out of my power to pur&s;ue either the hand&s;ome fugitive or dete&s;table robber. But I &s;hall &s;end a man to Paris, who I intend &s;hall ramain in that part of the city where M. de Var|mont re&s;ides, in order to find out whether the poor creature has fallen into the hands of him &s;he dete&s;ts.

<P>Adieu, my dear young brother. Sympathize with Eleanor in behalf of Murville. Since our de&s;tinies have &s;uch a re&s;emblance to each other, I love her more than ever.

<P>LET M. de Varmont feel contented, for nobody can di&s;cover any thing more. The bu&s;ine&s;s is done. Marcel would do nothing without I gave him a large &s;um, and I gave him all he a&s;ked for. I was &s;ure that M. de Varmont would not refu&s;e to give him his price. As &s;oon as the cage was open|ed, the bird went out of her&s;elf. For &s;ome time I was in a difficult &s;ituation, becau&s;e Marcel came away with us: but he left us a few leagues from Saumur. About break of day, in a &s;mall wood near Tours, the bird &s;ung her la&s;t &s;ong. I left her there dead, and covered with leaves.</P>
<P>I write to M. de Varmont from Blois, becau&s;e I am &s;ick at that place. The commi&s;&s;ion was &s;o dreadful to perform, that I am frightened at the thoughts of it. I had &s;carcely courage enough to perform it. I am &s;ure that M. de Varmont him&s;elf, though much more experienced than me, could not have done it without trembling. The bird had &s;uch a hand&s;ome plumage, and &s;uch a &s;weet voice, that I tremble to think of her, and feel very ill. M. de Varmont ought, in con&s;cience, to give me a thou|&s;and louis d'ors, in&s;tead of the five hundred he pro|mi&s;ed me; for I declare to you, that I would not do the like again for four times that &s;um.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XL. Emilia de Varmont to Celina.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>From the Par&s;onage of St. Cyr, near Tours,
<DATE>July 5, 1782,
7 o'clock evening.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NO longer, my dear Celina, can I he&s;itate to declare the unnatural cruelty of Varmont. He has endeavoured again to fill up the mea&s;ure of his crimes.</P>
<P>Having, for &s;everal days pa&s;t, been per&s;ecuted more than ever with the in&s;ulting propo&s;als of Murville, I tried in vain to gain over Marcel to my intere&s;t. This Marcel was a &s;ervant of Mur|ville, who was entru&s;ted with the keys of my pri|&s;on. Judge whether I did not redouble my efforts to e&s;cape, when a me&s;&s;age brought from Varmont by Lafleur, gave me to under&s;tand that my enemy would do every thing in his power to complete my de&s;truction. My entreaties became &s;o frequent and &s;o pathetic, that at length Marcel &s;eemed to be affected by them. The day before ye&s;terday we agreed on the manner of my e&s;cape. About twelve o'clock on the night following, I was to be ready to go away with him. He came according to ap|pointment, opened the doors of my apartment, and it &s;eemed perfectly &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion that he came without light. We went &s;oftly down &s;tairs, and ha&s;tened acro&s;s the garden, where I was at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a chai&s;e and hor&s;es ready to carry me away. Marcel ob&s;erving my &s;urpri&s;e at this circum&s;tance, &s;aid, in a low voice, "You mu&s;t leave the neighbourhood of the ca&s;tle as &s;oon as
<PB N="112" REF="035743_0108_1006AE9E3019CFF0">
po&s;&s;ible; for at this time of night, if you &s;hould go on foot upon the public road, you could not get far enough to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of your e&s;cape. My intention is to conduct you many leagues from this place, where I mu&s;t leave you as &s;oon as day-light appears. You &s;hall then be at liberty to go where you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>Satisfied with this artful &s;peech, I &s;tept into the carriage. Marcel fixed him&s;elf upon the back part of it; and &s;o great was my joy at the idea of being once more at liberty, that I never thought of in|quiring who the po&s;tilion was. Alas! as &s;oon as day-light appeared, I knew him but too well!</P>
<P>Ju&s;t after Marcel left us, I began to be terrified at finding my&s;elf in the power of a &s;tranger. The po&s;tilion left the public road and went a great di&s;tance in a cro&s;s road farther into the wood. Then I was chilled with fear, and cried aloud. He turned his face towards me, and &s;aid, "<HI>If you don't keep a profound &s;ilence, I will kill you!</HI>" Ah, Celina! conceive, if you can, the horror of my thoughts at that time! When he looked at me I beheld in his features and voice, that of the cruel dome&s;tic who&s;e appearance at Murville's ca&s;tle, a few days before, had &s;o much affrighted me. My eyes grew dim, a cold &s;weat ran down my face, and I remained in the carriage as motionle&s;s as a &s;tatue, expecting every moment would be my la&s;t; for I was confident he conducted me into the wood in order to take my life.</P>
<P>We had not gone much farther before we ar|rived to a dark rece&s;s of the wood, more gloomy than we had entered before. Lafleur here &s;topped his hor&s;es, when I &s;creamed aloud, but he looked upon me with &s;uch a menacing a&s;pect that fear chilled my voice. There was, however, I believe,
<PB N="113" REF="035743_0109_1006AEA2BA7FCCB0">
&s;omething in my countenance and attitude which &s;oftened his barbarity. He then turned his face another way. Alas! he looked away only to re|cover his wonted fiercene&s;s, and &s;oon re&s;umed his cruel re&s;olutions. Several times did he turn his face from me, and again towards me, in the &s;pace of a few minutes, which gave me alternate glimmer|ings of hope and returns of ab&s;olute de&s;pair. He often &s;lackened the pace of his hor&s;es, and, as I mentioned before, looked again upon his victim with an a&s;pect full of ferocity. There being no hope left but in gaining his compa&s;&s;ion, I fell on my knees in the fatal carriage, and pre&s;ented to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in my face bedewed with tears, and &s;tretched out towards him my hands cla&s;ped together. This &s;pectacle &s;eemed to affect him, but the impre&s;&s;ion of pity was of &s;uch &s;hort duration, that I expected every moment that his work would be accompli&s;h|ed. So great was my confu&s;ion, that I died as it were a thou&s;and times before receiving the fatal &s;troke.</P>
<P>Lafleur then armed him&s;elf with more courage, &s;tepped out of the carriage, and, le&s;t my looks &s;hould again di&s;hearten him, he turned a&s;ide his eyes when coming cowards me: but I &s;prung out of the carriage and looked him full in the face, by which means he was again &s;o di&s;heartened that he could not &s;trike me. Encouraged by an attempt &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, I fell at his feet, caught him by the knees, and cried out, "No, no, friend! you will not do it: you are not &s;o unmerciful as the cruel man who employed you. Can you, who merci|fully reached forth your hands to a&s;&s;i&s;t me when I was ready to peri&s;h in the waters, have a heart to perpetrate the atrocious crime he commands you? Leave, Oh, leave the execution of this crime to
<PB N="114" REF="035743_0110_1006AEA6BABE0A48">
him who was about to plunge me again into the waves! Can you fear that I, who kept my misfor|tunes and real name as a &s;ecret when I was with Murville, in order to &s;creen Varmont from the puni&s;hment his villainy de&s;erved, would not promi&s;e never to betray you, for the pre&s;ervation of my life? This I &s;till promi&s;e to do. I will go into &s;ome ob&s;cure village, and bury my mi&s;ery and mi&s;|fortunes together. Nobody &s;hall ever hear any more of Emilia de Varmont. This I &s;wear to do by all that is &s;acred. Go, then, to the unmerciful man who &s;ent you, and tell him the work is ac|compli&s;hed. Let him rejoice at my unhappy end. Let him enrich him&s;elf with my &s;poils: and I &s;hall always remember, that, when he cruelly de|termined to take my life, you had the goodne&s;s to pre&s;erve it."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I thus &s;trove to awaken in his heart the &s;entiments of humanity, he &s;eemed to be in a con|flict with contrary pa&s;&s;ions. I ob&s;erved him with the ha&s;ty, though &s;trict attention, which we al|ways exerci&s;e in imminent danger. On his coun|tenance, which at fir&s;t was an emblem of audacious de&s;pair, was now painted the irre&s;olutions of anxi|ous &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Happily for me, pity almo&s;t imme|diately &s;ucceeded, and with pity, repentance &s;uc|ceeded al&s;o. At la&s;t the happy moment arrived, when my a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, if he had been able to &s;peak, would have de&s;ired my pardon. His lifted arm now fell, and the &s;word dropped from his hand. Then I aro&s;e, ready to improve the moment as that of my &s;alvation, and ran into the thicke&s;t part of the woods&mdash;and running directly from him, hoping to find &s;ome &s;ecure hiding-place. Soon put to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;topping to take breath, I looked back, and could not refrain from &s;o doing, to &s;ee what
<PB N="115" REF="035743_0111_1006AEA8883B50A8">
had become of Lafleur. He was yet &s;tanding in the place where I left him. But why had he changed his attitude? Why did he view me &s;o earne&s;tly whil&s;t I was retreating? The idea of my not being out of danger, inclined me to continue my flight. Fear gave me new &s;trength, and I con|tinued this time retreating, until I had the &s;upreme &s;atisfaction of hearing the carriage going away with full &s;peed. Then finding my &s;trength &s;ud|denly fail me, I fell voluntarily upon the ground, and wept with exce&s;&s;ive joy. Then, with an ad|dre&s;s to the throne of mercy, imploring pardon for the impious wretch who thir&s;ted for my blood, I gave a thou&s;and thanks to the Almighty Pre&s;erver of men, who re&s;cues the feeble from the cruel op|pre&s;&s;or. My whole &s;oul was penetrated with that joy which &s;ucceeds terror at the moment when im|pending danger is &s;uddenly removed. I congratu|lated my&s;elf on the painful trial I had ju&s;t expe|rienced, &s;ince I hoped this might be the la&s;t; &s;ince I hoped, by this price, to purcha&s;e complete liberty; &s;ince I, at the &s;ame time, e&s;caped, and that forever, the rage of a dete&s;table brother, and the per&s;ecutions of a libertine.</P>
<P>But whither, thought I, &s;hall I direct my &s;teps? By what means can I find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? Alas! of whom can I a&s;k it? But why &s;hould I fear? I can|not believe that an unfortunate woman, who has not merited her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, can look for an a&s;ylum in vain. Have I not rea&s;on to believe that the ever ju&s;t Providence, which watches over the wretched, has &s;afely conducted me through a long and dreadful &s;torm, in order to conduct me to a harbour of &s;afety? Will it permit all the evils which can befal human nature, to fall on my in|nocent youth? It is not an unrea&s;onable hope, that
<PB N="116" REF="035743_0112_1006AEB2B1C9DD68">
after &s;o many &s;ufferings, I may find &s;ome &s;ecure and honourable retreat, in the ob&s;curity of a life ever laborious, in which, although I could not enjoy happine&s;s, I might find &s;ome tranquility.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections renewed my courage and hope. Then I aro&s;e and walked on with new re&s;olution, to look out for &s;ome part of the country where a le&s;s deplorable fate awaited me. Soon did I traver&s;e the wood in its full extent; &s;oon did I find my&s;elf upon a public road, and di&s;covered, not far di&s;|tant, &s;everal &s;teeples, which convinced me they, were accompanied with a large number of habita|tions; and a little while afterwards the ma&s;s of buildings appeared to be divided in &s;uch a manner, as made me &s;uppo&s;e there was a large city near me with an adjacent village. The latter appeared more &s;uitable for my &s;ituation than the former. I &s;uppo&s;ed that, in a village, I &s;hould have the be&s;t chance for concealment. In a village, where reigns a &s;implicity of manners, we are more likely to find the virtues of ho&s;pitality. Re&s;olved by the&s;e con|&s;iderations, I left the city of Tours on my right hand, entered the hamlet of St. Cyr, and knocked at the door of the par&s;onage. A young man opened the door, when I que&s;tioned him as follows:</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h," &s;aid I, "to &s;peak to the Curate."</P>
<P>"Speak to me then," an&s;wered he, "for I am the per&s;on you a&s;k for."</P>
<P>"Do you &s;tand in need, Mon&s;ieur, of a &s;ervant maid?"</P>
<P>"No, Mademoi&s;elle, I have no occa&s;ion for a &s;ervant; what I mo&s;t &s;tand in need of are the means of employing and &s;upporting one: tho&s;e per&s;ons, therefore, who directed you to me, do not know what a poor, &s;canty portioned fellow I am."</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="035743_0113_1006AEBBE8177938">"What!" replied I, "do you refu&s;e to &s;helter me under your roof? Is there no room for me in your hou&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Room, yes, as much as you plea&s;e; but of provi&s;ions very little, and of money none at all."</P>
<P>"For my part, I want only to labour for a little bread."</P>
<P>"As to bread, Mademoi&s;elle," replied he, "I have not an abundance of it; but I will not refu&s;e to divide it between you and me. We can gather here and there a few herbs to eat with it; &s;ometimes a little milk, and &s;ometimes a few eggs; but re|member that in bread con&s;i&s;ts the principal part of my cookery. You de&s;ire," continued he (looking upon me with more attention) "to be my &s;er|vant; but if your genteel appearance does not belie you, you were not made to labour for your bread." I interrupted him&mdash;</P>
<P>"The mo&s;t &s;imple employment, Mon&s;ieur, is what I mo&s;t de&s;ire."</P>
<P>"Believe me," replied he with as much mildne&s;s as gaiety, "although you &s;eem to have an excel|lent di&s;po&s;ition, I cannot but think, after all you can &s;ay, that you are as delicate as you are hand&s;ome. The rude bu&s;tle of hou&s;ehold affairs would incom|mode you. I take the charge of that my&s;elf, and am accu&s;tomed to it. You &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t me in &s;ome &s;mall matters of gardening; you &s;hall take charge of my linen, which, by the by, is not very good, and wa&s;h my two &s;urplices, one at a time. Will you?"</P>
<P>"Very willingly," an&s;wered I.</P>
<P>"You &s;urpri&s;e me, my charming girl! Why I tell you again that with me you will want every thing." Whil&s;t he was &s;peaking, I ob&s;erved him with much attention. His appearance, like his
<PB N="118" REF="035743_0114_1006AEBF26F9FB48">
conver&s;ation, in&s;pired me with complete confidence. "Pray, Mon&s;ieur," re&s;umed I, "let me know my fate&mdash;put an end to my perplexity&mdash;receive me into your hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Indeed, young woman, I wanted no urging in this matter; I only told you the&s;e circum&s;tances beforehand, that you might know what you had to expect&punc; One word more, if you plea&s;e: Will you never leave the hou&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Do not doubt it, Mon&s;ieur, I never will."</P>
<P>"And will you become my niece?"</P>
<P>"Your niece! yes, that is all I can de&s;ire."</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid he, "you are in the right. Al|though the rich are &s;ometimes the mo&s;t lovely, they are &s;eldom the mo&s;t happy, and are rarely the be&s;t people." (Reaching forth his hand in as inviting manner) "Come in" continued he, "you are a welcome gue&s;t. I expect you will remain with me for &s;everal years. With me you will be poor and temperate; but if your di&s;po&s;ition is like mine, you will, in return, have a good appetite, cheerful temper, and contented mind," Upon this I went into the hou&s;e. I tru&s;t, my &s;i&s;ter, that your mind is now relieved from the anxiety yon felt on beginning to read this letter. And as I am weary of writing, I will lay down my pen till to-morrow. To-morrow I purpo&s;e to give you an account of my conver&s;ation with the good Curate whom I have cho&s;en for my ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>HE invited me to a breakfa&s;t, which con&s;i&s;ted of cherries and brown bread, and gave me &s;ome water to drink. In&s;tead of my &s;erving him, he waited on me, his &s;ervant maid, with much at|tention. Alas! if he had not di&s;covered a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible intere&s;t in my happine&s;s, I could have &s;aid nothing to him. Nothing but the repeated te&s;ti|monies of his goodne&s;s could have given me courage enough for revealing to him that part of my misfortunes which it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould know. "Mon&s;ieur," &s;aid I, "if you do not con|ceal in your brea&s;t the half-confidences I am go|ing to make you,"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Wherefore half-confidences?" &s;aid he, inter|rupting me.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e my de&s;tinies are frightful," replied I. "Ah! how much le&s;s &s;hould I have rea&s;on to complain on account of my misfortunes, if they were &s;uch that I could reveal them all! But I can a&s;&s;ure you, that the di&s;grace of tho&s;e misfortunes which I cannot reveal, does not fall upon me. No, it does not fall upon me, I can &s;olemnly de|clare.
<PB N="4" REF="035743_0117_1006AECDC3DC6358">
Do not, I be&s;eech you, refu&s;e to believe me, for I am not in&s;en&s;ible of the truth, that though di&s;&s;imulation may &s;ometimes be permitted, perjury can never be pardonable. You &s;hall be informed of every part of my adver&s;ities which I can po&s;&s;ibly reveal; but deign to remember that the limited confidence I repo&s;e in you, requires an inviolable &s;ecrecy. One unguarded word might prove my ruin; one word might di&s;cover to my enemies the place of my retreat; and I know them to be &s;o inveterate as to come even to this ob&s;cure and (as you made me believe) peaceable retreat, to &s;natch me from hence. The unju&s;t hatred and per&s;ecution of my relations have been the cau&s;es of all my ill fortune."</P>
<P>"It was the ill judged tenderne&s;s of mine," re|plied he, "which proved my ruin."</P>
<P>"They determined to make me a nun," con|tinued I.</P>
<P>"And mine &s;ucceeded in making me a prie&s;t."</P>
<P>"Pray let me inform you, Mon&s;ieur, how I e&s;caped the cloi&s;ter, where their avaricious cruelty was about to confine me."</P>
<P>"Wor&s;e than that!" &s;aid he, "I could not e&s;|cape the &s;eminary where their ambitious kindne&s;s impri&s;oned me."</P>
<P>"A man into who&s;e power I was placed by my per&s;ecutions took an ill advantage of my &s;ituation, and attempted to &s;educe me."</P>
<P>This la&s;t declaration mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected his benevolent heart. As my misfortunes appeared to him in a &s;tronger light, he became &s;o much inter|e&s;ted in them, that his gaiety was &s;uddenly &s;uc|ceeded by &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. He &s;ighed, my &s;i&s;ter, and then in a &s;erious tone replied:</P>
<P>"That upon the fir&s;t view of your charms, a
<PB N="5" REF="035743_0118_1006AED7EB86D668">
man might be &s;o tran&s;ported as to be unable to re|pel a &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion; that this pa&s;&s;ion might at fir&s;t in&s;pire him with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, I can ea&s;ily be|lieve; but after having heard you, after approach|ing nearer to tho&s;e innocent features, and that vir|tuous charm which your mode&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, your decent a&s;pect, and every trait of your angelic figure, equally in&s;pire&mdash;after having admired the winning graces of your ingenuous candour, if he is not then captivated with becoming re&s;pect for your mild at|tractions; or if he &s;hould &s;till indulge a criminal de&s;ire, I &s;hould deem it a prodigy. But go on with your relation."</P>
<P>"He attempted to &s;educe me. A new crime wre&s;ted me from his hands to place them in yours, which I hope may prove innocent and pure."</P>
<P>"Which always have been," cried he, "and which always &s;hall be."</P>
<P>"But now," continued I, "of all the numerous gifts of fortune which I but lately enjoyed, not one remains. I am bere&s;t of all my relations, and have even lo&s;t my name."</P>
<P>"Here," replied he with his former gaiety, "you may find as many names as you plea&s;e. I know the calendar by heart. Come, we will look out the hand&s;ome&s;t and worthie&s;t that can be found. Julia, for example. No, this would be un&s;uitable; Julia would be too noble for the niece of a poor Curate. The Grand Vicar would complain of it. We cannot do better than to di|mini&s;h it: you &s;hall be called Juliette: and do not be di&s;&s;atisfied with it, for you will feel none the wor&s;e for being called by that name. At pre&s;ent," continued he, "you &s;hall have nothing to do with hou&s;ehold affairs. The day of your arrival &s;hall be a &s;acred day; I invite you to con&s;ecrate it to
<PB N="6" REF="035743_0119_1006AEDF43C247C0">
repo&s;e. If, however, you prefer amu&s;ing your|&s;elf by examining every apartment of your new dwelling, I would have you do &s;o. For my part, I mu&s;t leave you, although with regret, to go and fini&s;h &s;ome urgent bu&s;ine&s;s in the garden."</P>
<P>The good behaviour and good di&s;po&s;ition of this young man in&s;pired me with complete confidence. Yet I cannot but confe&s;s, after all, that I feel &s;omewhat unea&s;y. If my ears have not greatly deceived me, my uncle repeated &s;everal times, la&s;t evening, in a low voice, an extraordinary phra&s;e: "<HI>They ought even to marry the prie&s;ts.</HI>" After we had done &s;upper he pronounced it more di&s;|tinctly, immediately left the room, and ran into the next apartment, from whence he brought a ba&s;e-viol, on which he played with a pen&s;ive and melancholy air. After it was late enough to bid him good night, and I wi&s;hed to do &s;o, he &s;till continued playing. Too much occupied to an&s;wer me, he ro&s;e mechanically, and, without &s;aying a word, &s;till playing on his ba&s;e-viol, he conducted me to the door of the &s;mall chamber he had ap|pointed for me.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Celina, I will confe&s;s to you my great weakne&s;s. On finding my&s;elf &s;urround|ed by four walls, &s;carcely whitened, in a &s;ort of garret, where a matra&s;s, three chairs, almo&s;t &s;tript of their &s;traw &s;eats, a worm-eaten table, a bit of a looking gla&s;s, and &s;ome fragments of a praying de&s;k compo&s;ed the whole furniture, I could not forbear weeping. Child that I was! Is not peace of mind the fir&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings? And does it con&s;i&s;t in the vain decorations of our dwellings? Is not the meane&s;t cottage, where the vices of the rich and noble cannot reach you, va&s;tly preferable to the &s;tately palaces of the great, which are &s;o many
<PB N="7" REF="035743_0120_1006AEE3736DB5E0">
nur&s;eries of cruel and effeminate pa&s;&s;ions? As for me, I have lately had a melancholy proof of the latter, but at pre&s;ent feel the favourable &s;ituation of the former. For &s;everal weeks of late, labour|ing under a thou&s;and di&s;quietudes whil&s;t &s;leeping under gilded canopies, I never clo&s;ed my eyes but with trembling; now, in a garret, I have &s;lept in peace; early in the morning awoke with a mind free from di&s;tre&s;s, a clear memory, and compo&s;ed imagination; with &s;o much compo&s;ure as to give you a long detail of the events and conver&s;ation of la&s;t evening, without fearing the malignity of my enemies. This I do from a conviction that there is nothing in my new &s;ituation which can fail of exciting the tender intere&s;t of my &s;i&s;ter, or her im|patient curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>But tell me, my dear Celina, what you think of this frequent exclamation of my uncle, which, me|thinks, I could not mi&s;under&s;tand, and which gives me &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s? What, my &s;i&s;ter! can a prie&s;t have pa&s;&s;ions like other men? Will not my honour, in the hou&s;e of a prie&s;t, be as &s;ecure as my life? Perhaps I am blinded too ea&s;ily with de|lu&s;ive hopes. It would be erroneous in me to be|lieve my &s;orrows at an end. Oh, Bovile! who&s;e compa&s;&s;ionate tenderne&s;s may yet &s;toop with &s;ome plea&s;ure towards her who &s;till cheri&s;hes the fond remembrance of thy virtues, from the regions of eternal peace, whence thou can'&s;t de&s;cend to watch over her, deign to come, O exalted and benevo|lent &s;pirit! to pity, protect, and enlighten thy once loved Emilia! Through what dreadful &s;torms has &s;he, by her cruel enemies, been driven into this port; where, perhaps, &s;he rejoices with too much &s;ecurity in a calm which may yet prove deceitful!</P>

<P>I AM much encouraged, my &s;i&s;ter. As &s;oon as I made my appearance this morning, my uncle came ha&s;tily to me and &s;aid:&mdash;</P>
<P>"As many impertinent per&s;ons may &s;oon trouble you with embarra&s;&s;ing que&s;tions concerning our relation to each other, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, my niece, that you become acquainted with the family of your uncle. M. Jerome Sevin, the father of your uncle, is, in fact, the only phy&s;ician of the animals in his village. His forefathers have, for a century, inherited the privilege of bequeathing far|riers to Nanterre. And I al&s;o, in all probability, was made by heaven to give &s;hoes and phy&s;ic in my turn to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Les ro&s;&s;es du canton.</NOTE>jades of the canton. Oh, why did the authors of my being permit the rage of ag|grandizement to ferment in their brains! It is true, that they hoped, by means of this black coat, to make my fortune and their &s;alvation. O that their prayers may be heard! and may they hereafter re|vive in the next world, as happy as I remain poor in the pre&s;ent! In the pre&s;ent, my niece, whoever will not conde&s;cend to cringe to his betters and flatter them, will never arrive to preferment: and one who is quite incapable of flattering the pa&s;&s;ions of men, might practi&s;e the art of curing di&s;ea&s;ed hor&s;es with great &s;ucce&s;s. I was, however, the
<PB N="9" REF="035743_0122_1006AEF0E33820E8">
dear vicar of a Norman Curate&mdash;that is to &s;ay, his proud tithing man. But in order to render his friend&s;hip profitable to me, it was nece&s;&s;ary to court, with a&s;&s;iduity, the maid of the grand vicar, the principal lacquies of my bi&s;hop, his &s;ecretary, a man of no le&s;s influence, his little favourite dog, his quarterly man-&s;ervant, and his weekly mi&s;tre&s;s. Never could I conde&s;cend to &s;o much cringing. For which rea&s;on, my benefactor, with all his in|fluence, &s;ucceeded no farther than ca&s;ting me into this ruined par&s;onage, a mere <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, in French, was Cul de &s;ac apo&s;tolique. The term cul de &s;ac, is u&s;ed to &s;ignify a narrow &s;treet in a city, through which none can pa&s;s.
<BIBL><HI>Tran&s;lator.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> apo&s;tolical by-lane, in which I am obliged to con&s;ume annually, till death en&s;ues, and, at my own ri&s;k, the enormous &s;um of five hundred livres. My poor relations, notwith&s;tanding, were all overjoyed at the news of my promotion. My mother, &s;trong in the faith of my &s;acred meditation, believed her&s;elf thence|forth &s;ure of paradi&s;e. By the&s;e means &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed the va&s;t doors of heaven were already un|folded, and per&s;uaded her&s;elf that nothing was wanting in order to gain admittance, but a change of my name. My father, more &s;en&s;ibly affected with the good things of this life, did not derive his highe&s;t &s;atisfaction from con&s;idering that the mo&s;t topping folks in the village pulled off their hats to his &s;on. Both of them, however, &s;poke with pride, re&s;pect, and admiration of their &s;on, the Rev. Curate! How would the good people be a&s;|toni&s;hed, if I &s;hould try to convince them, that Sevin would have lived more contentedly in the laborious and ob&s;cure profe&s;&s;ion of his forefathers! There is nothing, I confe&s;s, very laborious in the
<PB N="10" REF="035743_0123_1006AEF85439CF88">
office of a prie&s;t. It chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in humming over a few phra&s;es in an unknown tongue; and &s;ince nobody under&s;tands them, no matter how awkwardly. Nor is it very difficult to harrangue in that convenient tribune, where we have ac|quired the privilege of being always in the right. And I cannot but think, that my equals, who, like me, were born &s;imple pea&s;ants, mu&s;t feel their vanity wonderfully rai&s;ed, when they con&s;ider what re&s;pect is devolved on one of their equals, and are not le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the more profitable honor he attains to, of picking, periodically, at the table of the lady of the village. But are not the&s;e enjoy|ments, which we may even call imaginary, the&s;e unfrequent entertainments of my condition, too cruelly purcha&s;ed by the &s;acrifice of tho&s;e real plea&s;ures to which nature &s;ometimes invites us, the de&s;ire and opportunity of which we mu&s;t never improve? And where can the pa&s;tor be found, who can often publi&s;h the bands of matrimony without a &s;ecret di&s;quietude, and receive without emotion the confe&s;&s;ion of a hand&s;ome girl, after &s;he has gone a&s;tray, and be always ready, when|ever required, by the charm of &s;acramental words, to make man and wife of two lovers? Can he cheerfully accord thus to others that &s;weete&s;t li|cen&s;e, which he, poor bachelor, has not for him|&s;elf? I acknowledge," continued he with warmth, "that you may at fir&s;t be &s;urpri&s;ed at this di&s;cour&s;e; but it would wound me to the heart, if it &s;hould much longer give you any alarm. At the fir&s;t &s;ight of your beauty, I was &s;urpri&s;ed, and found my re&s;olution ready to for&s;ake me. But if I am not deceived, my weakne&s;s was momentary. Could I even &s;uppo&s;e, young woman, that you were not innocent, or could I become le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the du|ties
<PB N="11" REF="035743_0124_1006AEFA24882470">
towards you which ho&s;pitality enjoins upon me, I flatter my&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding, that I &s;hould have fortitude enough to remember my vows. Re|ligious vows &s;hould be kept inviolably. As for mine, whatever trials and &s;truggles they may co&s;t me, they &s;hall be held &s;acred until the happy day, which I cannot but hope for, when the mo&s;t hu|mane of laws &s;hall relieve me from them. Whil&s;t waiting for that happy period, forgive my com|plaining. Permit me, my niece, to offer you al&s;o the confidence with which I &s;alute every vi&s;itant. Prepare your&s;elf to hear me often &s;tun your ears with my favourite phra&s;e: "They ought to marry the prie&s;ts."</P>
<P>"Do not fear that I &s;hall be very trouble&s;ome on the occa&s;ion of the&s;e repetitions: for, by an effect of my temper, which is naturally &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, I compo&s;e my&s;elf under the evils I experience, &s;o as to view them in the mo&s;t favourable light. Al|though I have not &s;ucceeeded in feeling &s;atisfied with my lot, I have acquired, without much difficulty, the habit of &s;upporting it with gaiety. Perhaps I might &s;oon con&s;ider my &s;ituation almo&s;t enviable, if I could &s;ometimes alleviate the mi&s;eries of my poor pari&s;hioners without the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my friends."</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections of my adopted uncle charmed me. But I derived the highe&s;t opinion of his goodne&s;s, from the certain proof he gave me, that his de&s;ire of benevolence was not alone, but ac|companied with real acts of genero&s;ity. After we had &s;pent &s;everal hours in the garden, my&s;elf em|ployed in propping the plants, and he, by turns, handling the rake and the &s;pade; the good air, his exerci&s;e, and the heat of the day, had equally con|tributed to his ardent thir&s;t and keen appetite.

When we came to &s;it at the table, one would have thought that he alone would have devoured the plate of greens prepared for us both; that he alone would have emptied the bottle already un&s;topped. Then, in&s;tead of filling his gla&s;s, he a&s;ked me "if I had a reli&s;h for wine?" Almo&s;t chagrined at my refu&s;al, he prote&s;ted I was wrong in never drinking any, and that he was right in loving it. "But I tremble," cried he, "in being unable to this day to &s;wallow any thing except pure water. At the &s;lighte&s;t indi&s;po&s;ition of the people in the village, they are ordered to diet, and they are well advi&s;ed; but wine and broth are mo&s;t needful for my pea&s;ants, who are never &s;ick but with hunger and fatigue: and as there is in this village," continued he, "a poor infirm man, for whom this is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, it is clear that I ought to deny it to my&s;elf, for whom it would be a &s;uperfluity; &s;ince, thank God, I am always in good health. Go then, Juliette, (giving me the bottle,) pray &s;omebody to &s;how you the way to the hou&s;e of Lucas the wea|ver. Go, let them receive the &s;alutary pre&s;ent from your hands. When they &s;ee your behaviour, hear your language, and ob&s;erve the magnificence of your pre&s;ent, his wretched family will believe you are nothing le&s;s than an angel &s;ent from heaven. Deny your&s;elf, my girl, the honors of deification; mode&s;tly confe&s;s your&s;elf to be a mortal, and what is &s;till wor&s;e, the niece of the poor Curate who &s;ent you."</P>
<P>You cannot imagine, my &s;i&s;ter, with what tran&s;ports the good people received me; with how many thanks my pre&s;ent was received, nor what a high character they gave their excellent pa&s;tor. I believe, that next to the uncommon genero&s;ity of the benefactor, there cannot be any thing more

humorou&s;ly affecting, than the extreme gratitude of the obliged. When I returned to the par&s;onage I went in &s;miling, but with tears in my eyes.</P>
<P>"Very well, very well!" &s;aid my uncle, "you &s;eem to be affected; you have then a generous heart." Then taking me by the hand, he added: "Juliette, I &s;hould have been well plea&s;ed with the commi&s;&s;ion my&s;elf; but I rather cho&s;e to give that plea&s;ure to you."</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear Celina, I &s;hall never forget this affecting interview. I begin to hope that peaceful days, and even days of real enjoyment, are re&s;erved for me in this ob&s;cure retreat.</P>

<P>EVERY inclination of my uncle evinces his &s;en&s;ibility. This evening, in a &s;ort of hall, I ob&s;erved &s;everal in&s;truments of mu&s;ic: my &s;tate of mind was &s;uch as to leave me no inclination for exerting my feeble talents, and had it even been otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould have thought it mo&s;t advi&s;able not to di&s;cover them. "As little as you like mu&s;ic," &s;aid my uncle, "I purpo&s;e to learn you what little I know of it. Do not deny your&s;elf this amu&s;e|ment. It is of great advantage in adver&s;ity.

not charm it away. Oh it cannot be di&s;puted! I am the friend of all mankind. And believe me, when I am ca&s;t down by the languors of my &s;oli|tary condition, there is my ba&s;e-viol! I lay hold of it, and &s;aw upon it with all my might. My mo&s;t violent fits of melancholy cannot re&s;i&s;t its power during one morning. It is quite otherwi&s;e when we form a concert, for then I believe my&s;elf in heaven! Yes, my niece, as poor as you find me, we &s;ometimes form a concert! I will tell you how it is. It is clear that this in&s;trument cannot be mine, for it is worth three years of my &s;alary; it is the piano of a lady who entru&s;ted me with it at the reque&s;t of her brother. Her brother is the mo&s;t intimate of my friends, and I cannot but boa&s;t of it; for the excellent youth is without an equal. When his &s;i&s;ter comes with him, &s;he plays on the piano; he &s;eizes his violin; their ma&s;ter draws from its ca&s;e the divine clarinet, and the trio en|chants me. But I have &s;uch &s;trong rea&s;ons for preferring the quatuor, that I wi&s;h to become one of the party. It is true, that I &s;ometimes di&s;com|mode it, by keeping my part behind the re&s;t. What then? Suppo&s;e I do not keep perfect time? The&s;e are the &s;mall inconveniences of mea&s;ure. Where can we find the ro&s;e which is de&s;titute of thorns? The ma&s;ter gives me the mo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s of any in the company. I always tremble when he takes notice of my part, le&s;t he become affronted and take to his heels. Worthle&s;s man! how trouble|&s;ome he is! As good luck would have it, the di&s;|ciples are not &s;o impatient, and accu&s;tom them|&s;elves, dear in&s;trument! to thy frequent in&s;ults, And in the action of playing, my dear companion, &s;uch as it is, gives me &s;uch plea&s;ing ec&s;tacies, that it would be cruel to forbid it me.

What young man is this, who pre|&s;ents to my &s;ight the living image of an individual of his &s;ex whom I have rea&s;on to dread, and whom I may ju&s;tly de&s;pi&s;e; yet has only given me a &s;ur|pri&s;e de&s;titute of terror? Who, neverthele&s;s, has power to di&s;turb my repo&s;e; to give me &s;uch lively emotions as I never felt before; and a &s;ecret agitation which gives me no pain?

It is an ab&s;urd prejudice which di&s;graces tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions which are allowed both by our manners and laws; &s;uch as cannot be de&s;pi&s;ed but on account of their unnoticed utility, or their unrewarded painful labours. There are none of the&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed condi|tions, which may ju&s;tly be called mean, however low they may appear in the eyes of tho&s;e men who are &s;o ridiculou&s;ly proud, as to &s;uppo&s;e that nature has formed them for managing &s;ervants and being ma&s;ters. Is there any low rank among&s;t mankind which may not be honored for its peculiar virtues, and tho&s;e virtues united to &s;entiments worthy of a better condition?</P>
<P>No, my &s;i&s;ter, mo&s;t certainly there is not. My uncle's opinion was ju&s;t. I bear witne&s;s to it with a con&s;cience at perfect ea&s;e. I feel the truth of it by that noble pride which accompanies the forti|tude we &s;tand in need of, in order to endure mi&s;|fortunes. But pardon the emotion of fal&s;e &s;hame which affected me; for I am more a&s;hamed of in|tending to hide from you &s;uch an in&s;ignificant mat|ter than any thing el&s;e. The bu&s;ine&s;s I was em|ployed in was that of ironing (not the wor&s;t) &s;ur|plice of the poor Curate.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at that time I heard a noi&s;e near the hou&s;e that did not excite my attention, but my uncle
<PB N="17" REF="035743_0130_1006AF1B39310D60">
&s;tarted &s;uddenly and cried out with joy, "My young friend has returned." He ran ha&s;tily out and came back in a moment, attended by a young man.&mdash;O my &s;i&s;ter! conceive my amazement when I &s;aw Murville before me!</P>
<P>But no, no, thought I, this cannot be Mur|ville. However perfect the re&s;emblance may at fir&s;t appear to others, the difference is now very &s;triking to me. At the fir&s;t glance I could not quite determine; but immediately afterwards I was convinced of my mi&s;take. I plainly &s;aw in this &s;tranger the &s;tature and external form of my per|&s;ecutor; but his features and behaviour were very different. The deportment of Murville is &s;o full of a&s;&s;urance, that he appears more commanding: this &s;tranger, however, is not de&s;titute of engaging manners, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es natural graces not to be found in the other. The hand&s;ome figure of my per&s;ecutor di&s;covers all the vivacity which u&s;ually accompanies a per&s;on of lively wit; but he is greatly deficient in the mildne&s;s of a&s;pect which appears in the other; in that impre&s;&s;ion of good|ne&s;s which gives him the greate&s;t charm. Had this been Murville, he would have acco&s;ted me before now, with &s;o much gallantry that I could hardly have endured his pre&s;ence. On the con|trary, this &s;tranger &s;topped as &s;oon as he &s;aw me&punc; and &s;tood on the thre&s;hold of the door &s;upri&s;ed and out of countenance, as if he thought it dangerous to come in: and whil&s;t he looked at me &s;everal times, as it were by &s;tealth, his face was covered with blu&s;hes; and Murville, perhaps, never blu&s;hed in his life: and if he &s;hould by chance appear to be di&s;concerted in the pre&s;ence of a woman, he would probably con&s;ider it a di&s;grace.</P>
<P>No, my &s;i&s;ter, this young man is not my per|&s;ecutor,
<PB N="18" REF="035743_0131_1006AF2019BA51A8">
and though he pre&s;ents to my eyes the image of him, he does not affrighten me. I could not have thought it po&s;&s;ible ever to find in two per&s;ons &s;uch &s;imilar figures and &s;uch a different carriage.</P>
<P>To continue; he remained motionle&s;s, and I in|voluntarily gave him all my attention, till at length my unfortunate uncle, with cries of grief, called my attention to another object&mdash;"O my &s;urplice! my be&s;t &s;urplice, my niece! you burn my be&s;t &s;urplice!"</P>
<P>In fact, when the young man fir&s;t made his ap|pearance, my hand was rai&s;ed up, and afterwards, by a motion perfectly mechanical, gradually de|&s;cended with the hot iron, which, being held &s;till in the mid&s;t of my work, had made a con&s;iderable breach in it.</P>
<P>M. Sevin, much hurt, &s;colded Juliette. Then the &s;tranger approached to &s;tammer &s;omething in my behalf, and could not fail of &s;ucceeding: for my uncle is incapable of holding re&s;entment for a long time again&s;t any per&s;on. At this time his good nature returned &s;ooner than I de&s;ired, and he exerci&s;ed it at the expence of his niece and his friend. M. Sevin, in his plea&s;antry, fir&s;t compli|mented the young man on his eagerne&s;s in defend|ing the blunders of a pretty girl. Then turning to Juliette, he a&s;ked her laughingly, why &s;he was &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;tracted at the light of a hand&s;ome young man? What the rea&s;on is I cannot tell; but the gaiety of the good Curate, which, on a thou&s;and other occa&s;ions has never di&s;plea&s;ed me, has now become &s;o trouble&s;ome that I cannot bear it.</P>
<P>How I wi&s;h he was &s;till offended! What would I not give that he would begin to quarrel with me again! In ha&s;te to get rid of his plea&s;antry I im|proved
<PB N="19" REF="035743_0132_1006AF21B3BC79F0">
the fir&s;t pretence that came in my head, ran to my chamber and &s;hut my&s;elf in. Here, to find &s;ome diver&s;ion to my reveries, I am ha&s;tily writing to my &s;i&s;ter what has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Yet I cannot but have &s;ome curio&s;ity and im|patience to learn the name and family of this young man. To know&mdash;But he is now going away, and my uncle calls me. Adieu, my &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>O MY brother! rejoice with me&mdash;I have ju&s;t &s;een her! and &s;he is quite well&mdash;Better, per|haps, than &s;he has ever appeared to you in her happie&s;t days! My arrival, which &s;he expected was not &s;o near&punc; has not a little contributed to her contentment. Did I write to you that I had been a journey? I have indeed been a very fortunate one, and more fortunate than I dared to expect. For it &s;eparated me from her but a &s;hort time, and my &s;udden, unexpected return has given her the greate&s;t joy. And if you knew how near death has appeared to her &s;ight, you would believe that her joy was not unnatural to her circum&s;tances! But her dangers, I hope, are all at an end. O happy circum&s;tance! &s;he is &s;aved! She has e&s;caped the impending danger that awaited her. The lo&s;s of Bovile will not bring her to an untimely grave!</P>
<P>Not that &s;he has cea&s;ed to love him&mdash;Ah! if the heart of Eleanor was capable of changing, I &s;hould

But, my brother, as you mentioned in your letter, &s;or|row cannot la&s;t forever. Sooner or later a day propitious to the unfortunate will arrive, that will wipe away their tears. Whil&s;t I am &s;peaking of the misfortunes of Eleanor, you will doubtle&s;s be of the opinion that &s;he would be de&s;irous of hear|ing the details of Bovile's la&s;t moments. I &s;ay his la&s;t moments, and perhaps I am wrong; until we have more ample ecclairci&s;&s;ements, we &s;hould &s;ay his la&s;t exploits: for Bovile's fate is not well known. Although we have &s;trong rea&s;ons for pre&s;uming his death, it is not ab&s;olutely declared. It appears but too certain, that the enemies of this brave man have &s;hamefully de&s;troyed him. Is it equally true that they have received the reward of their crimes? Can any man po&s;itively determine whether he is &s;till in being? Have patience with me, my bro|ther, whil&s;t I expre&s;s the&s;e doubts. O that they might appear le&s;s unrea&s;onable to me! I do but repeat them after my &s;i&s;ter. Her tenderne&s;s de|lights in them, whil&s;t her rea&s;on rejects them. Where are the unfortunate per&s;ons who do not eagerly court the &s;hadow of hope? If, however, &s;he mu&s;t renounce this &s;hadow; if it becomes a known fact that Bovile is lo&s;t, do you believe that his enemies, in order to fini&s;h their iniquity, will &s;o|licit the confi&s;cation of his goods, which they can|not do, except by di&s;gracing his memory?</P>
<P>Be kind enough, Murville, to an&s;wer the&s;e in|quiries. In the city where you re&s;ide, it will not be difficult to obtain information. Do not fail in taking every nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep and communicate to us, as &s;oon as convenient, the in&s;tructions we de&s;ire.</P>

<P>HOW &s;trange is my de&s;tiny! Whil&s;t I am not tormented by fatal events, my mind is perpetually hara&s;&s;ed with alarming accidents. At the hazard of my life was I re&s;cued from the ca&s;tle where the mo&s;t indelicate of lovers confined me, to &s;eek an in&s;ecure a&s;ylum, where I am, as it were, in the power and in the hands of my per&s;ecutor. At the &s;ight of that young man whom I &s;aw with|out fear, I ought indeed to have trembled! Not that he may have any intention of doing me the lea&s;t injury; but as he is the brother of Murville, he may ruin me without de&s;igning it. Therefore the agitation of mind I felt ye&s;terday was but a forewarning of my critical &s;ituation: and the pre&s;ent agitation and anxiety I feel, is only a ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of my new po&s;ition. Although I may be allowed to hope that there will not be any circum&s;tances calculated to di&s;cover the wretch|ed Emilia de Varmont; yet, there is abundant rea|&s;on to fear that Mademoi&s;elle de Terville may be
<PB N="22" REF="035743_0135_1006AF37F89DAAE8">
di&s;covered by a thou&s;and accidents. For in&s;tance, is it not probable that this young man, when writ|ing to his brother, may mention &s;ome circum|&s;tances&mdash;Ah, why? Why &s;hould he? What rea|&s;on can he have for mentioning me in his corre&s;|pondence with Murville? What probability can there be of his &s;peaking to his brother about Juliette, an ob&s;cure country girl? I cannot be|lieve he will. This is nothing but a groundle&s;s fear. Ah, my &s;i&s;ter, how we cheri&s;h the unwel|come intruder when our imaginations are tortured with gloomy apprehen&s;ions! There is not, how|ever, an ab&s;olute improbability in it; he may, by chance, make &s;ome mention of me in his letters. In fact, I may well think &s;o, when I have entirely devoted the pre&s;ent one to him. A fine compari|&s;on truly! Yet how extreme is the difference! My own &s;ecurity will often call my attention to this young man; but what is there in me &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to excite his attention? But my &s;elf-love leads me a&s;tray and &s;hews me an imaginary dan|ger.</P>
<P>Yet, after all, I have other rea&s;ons for indulging my fears, which are not &s;o imaginary, and which are too well founded. What can prevent Mur|ville, in an unexpected moment, from coming to &s;pend &s;everal days with his brother and &s;i&s;ter in the city of Tours, &s;o near the hamlet in which I am concealed? And how can I prevent a meeting which I tremble to think of? There is but one way to prevent it and that is by flight. But I am called, and mu&s;t leave you &s;uddenly. Farewell.</P>

<P>I HAVE now taken that part which &s;eems mo&s;t &s;uitable for my condition&mdash;that of bringing my benefactor to a recollection of the engage|ment he contracted with me, of not informing any per&s;on what little I told him concerning my mi&s;|fortunes. The good Curate renewed his promi&s;es, and prote&s;ted that every body &s;hould remain in the per&s;ua&s;ion of my being his niece, and that his friend already believed it. Be&s;ides this, I entertain hopes of another expedient. It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that this young man can have manners and princi|ples like tho&s;e of his brother. Every thing in him con&s;pires to convince the beholder of the real good|ne&s;s of his heart. His outward appearance is de|cent and courteous; his countenance full of &s;weet|ne&s;s, with an air of goodne&s;s and candour. But it &s;eems to me I have already told you&mdash;What mat|ters it if I do make a few repetitions? I tru&s;t you will forgive them. He has an excellent heart, Ce|lina, if I may believe my uncle, an excellent heart indeed. He is my uncle's intimate friend. Does not this circum&s;tance add &s;till to his prai&s;e? I de|termine al&s;o to gain his e&s;teem, his attention, and even excite his curio&s;ity. Before he becomes ac|quainted with my misfortunes, I would wi&s;h to have him feel intere&s;ted in my happine&s;s. And hereafter, if occa&s;ion &s;hould require it, I &s;hould wi&s;h, with complete a&s;&s;urance of his friend&s;hip, to
<PB N="24" REF="035743_0137_1006AF410C0D3C50">
tell him a part of my &s;orrows and apprehen&s;ions, &s;o as to acquire another protector who will warn me of Murville's approach, and turn him away from the place of my retreat, and who will con|tinually watch over my &s;afety. In &s;uch a critical &s;ituation I cannot provide too many re&s;ources, nor conduct beforehand with too much caution. Me|thinks I hear a noi&s;e at the door&mdash;I run to it&mdash;but I am mi&s;taken, nobody knocked. It is now al|mo&s;t &s;even o'clock, and my uncle tells me the young man generally come by &s;ix at late&s;t. What is the rea&s;on he is not here? Surely the pre&s;ence of a third per&s;on would not render the &s;ociety of his friend le&s;s agreeable. But perhaps my pre&s;ence would di&s;commode them. Yet I &s;hould not di&s;|turb their conver&s;ation, nor meddle with it. Ye&s;|terday, for in&s;tance, I did not &s;ay one word during his &s;tay. This might have given him &s;ome di&s;|plea&s;ure. Perhaps he thought me &s;overeignly di&s;|dainful. Scarcely had he taken his &s;eat before I went away and left him: and when I retired it was with &s;o much eagerne&s;s, that he mu&s;t have believed I de&s;ignedly treated him with unpolitene&s;s. If &s;o, he is much mi&s;taken. I am afraid he is of|fended, although he knew not the cau&s;e of my plight. To-day, therefore, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take away that impre&s;&s;ion, by giving him a more favourable reception, and, above all things, not to leave him. I determine, by all means, to keep him company, and not leave him till he goes away. How now! the pari&s;h clock &s;trikes, and I can count but &s;ix &s;trokes! Then I look at the index, and that points to &s;ix al&s;o! It mu&s;t then have been but five o'clock when my ears&mdash;Indeed I cannot tell what is the matter with me, for to-day I have heard and done every thing up&s;ide down, and in

&s;uch a manner as makes me feel impatient with my&s;elf. But I feel well contented to think it is no later. I begin to be afraid he will not come at all. I cannot but feel de&s;irous of &s;eeing him again, and it is perfectly natural that I &s;hould; for I am not yet acquainted with him. It is al&s;o true that I feel de&s;irous of anticipating a favourable opinion of him, but&mdash;Somebody knocks! now, certainly, I am not mi&s;taken. Adieu for the pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>YOU cannot tell how I am grieved, my &s;i&s;ter! How cruel it is to be capable of forming good re&s;olutions without a power of putting them into execution! I am di&s;plea&s;ed with my&s;elf to &s;uch a degree, that I am out of all patience!</P>
<P>With regard to what I wrote you concerning the young man, I was not mi&s;taken. He was certainly offended: I am &s;ure of it. His addre&s;s was graceful and re&s;pectful; but there was &s;ome|thing in his behaviour &s;o polite and re&s;erved, as to make it appear cold and forbidding. There was one ob&s;ervation I made, much to his advantage, which I cannot forbear mentioning. There ap|pears in his countenance a &s;ort of timid anxiety, which di&s;covers an inward fear of offending; &s;uch a mixture of noble pride and exalted goodne&s;s in his heart, as inclines me to admire him. I was preparing to give him a kind reception. Soon did
<PB N="26" REF="035743_0139_1006AF4595A80588">
I perceive that he con&s;idered me in the light of a per&s;on de&s;irous of retrieving my errors; &s;oon did his features re&s;ume a look of &s;atisfaction, an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of benevolence un&s;peakably charming. And, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, I experienced an inward emotion of &s;atisfaction difficult to expre&s;s. Thus far all was well. But, unfortunately for me, my uncle took it into his head to a&s;k his friend, "whe|ther the object of his late journey would remain a &s;ecret much longer?"</P>
<P>"This journey," an&s;wered his excellent friend, "is peculiarly intere&s;ting to my &s;i&s;ter, and this is all I am permitted to tell you. You would urge me in vain to tell you the motives for which I un|dertook it. This is a &s;ecret of Madame Florival: as for my own &s;ecrets, they &s;hall ever be yours, but tho&s;e of my &s;i&s;ter I have no right to reveal."</P>
<P>You will, I believe, be well &s;atisfied with his an&s;wer. As for me, I was delighted with it; and, as for my uncle, he &s;eemed well &s;atisfied with it him&s;elf. In the mean time M. Dolerval continued to entertain us with his &s;i&s;ter, and &s;eemed as if he would never cea&s;e prai&s;ing her. It is &s;aid that lovers are enthu&s;ia&s;ts. As for my&s;elf, I am not acquainted with their language; but if they u&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions in prai&s;e of the per&s;ons they admire, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which the tendere&s;t of brothers employed in prai&s;ing his &s;i&s;ter, their language mu&s;t indeed be captivating. Whil&s;t I li&s;tened to his conver&s;ation, it in&s;pired me with un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction. Ah! why &s;hould a &s;udden return to my&s;elf &s;o cruelly di&s;pel my infatuation! How happy, thought I, mu&s;t be this Madame Florival, whom heaven has fa|voured with &s;uch a brother! And what is my crime that I &s;hould be &s;i&s;ter to the inhuman Var|mont? However it may be with you, my dear
<PB N="27" REF="035743_0140_1006AF49EE7320E8">
Celina, this painful compari&s;on, this dreadful con|tra&s;t, wounded me to the very &s;oul. In vain did I &s;truggle to calm the fatal agitations of my mind. Oppre&s;&s;ed with the weight of my &s;orrows, I was ready to &s;ink under them: &s;o that I was obliged to quit my place and retire to my chamber, where I &s;hed a torrent of tears. After indulging my grief for a con&s;iderable time, I reflected on my ab&s;ence, and fearing it would appear to M. Dolerval as another unpolite retreat, I wiped away my tears and returned. At my return, he &s;eemed to be in|tere&s;ted in my &s;orrow, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired to know whether I was indi&s;po&s;ed. He que&s;tioned me with a tone of &s;ympathy &s;uitable to my wretch|edne&s;s, had he even been acquainted with it. His countenance changed, and he did violence to his feelings in order to conceal the intere&s;t he had in mine: and it was but a few minutes after my re|turn before he went away.</P>
<P>And what &s;leeping fury took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my uncle! he now declared it was time to go to bed. True, the clock had &s;truck eleven, but I am cer|tain &s;omething had deranged it. How can it be po&s;&s;ible that five long hours have glided away &s;ince the young man's arrival? The clock &s;urely goes too fa&s;t. Ye&s;terday I was of the &s;ame opinion, and that opinion is now confirmed; for the re|mainder of the night has &s;eemed of an extraordinary length. Twenty times did I awake thinking it was day; but it was nothing but the eternal moon, who&s;e never ending light deceived me. I was ready to think the &s;un would never ri&s;e. What folly is it in my uncle to be &s;o particular about the hour of ri&s;ing! I pity tho&s;e people who cannot mea&s;ure time without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a clock.</P>
<P>I will, however, except my uncle and M. Do|lerval.

M. Dolerval went away as &s;oon as I came back from my chamber. What urgent matter called him away &s;o &s;oon? He mu&s;t have been of|fended with me.

<P>Yet I cannot but thank you, Dolerval, for the good news you &s;ent me. I am overjoyed to learn that my &s;i&s;ter has recovered, but am not at all &s;ur|pri&s;ed at it.

But after all, I mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in believing that my &s;i&s;ter has had good &s;en&s;e enough to take my pre&s;cription, and Bovile, hav|ing been entirely forgotten, has, at la&s;t, obtained a &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Why do you exclaim with &s;o much vehemence? Not one circum&s;tance in your letter has e&s;caped my notice. You awkwardly endeavour to make it appear that "<HI>the unfortunate delight in care&s;&s;|ing &s;hadows.</HI>" Very well; I congratulate the un|happy in having &s;uch a plea&s;ant amu&s;ement, but &s;till in&s;i&s;t upon it, that it is high time for our &s;i&s;ter to care&s;s realities. And notwith&s;tanding your di&s;|crete writing, and her long-tried virtue, I am per|&s;uaded this is the part &s;he has taken. How much better for &s;ociety! To its great advantage I &s;ee a good effect, which being ca&s;t into commerce, will infallibly increa&s;e its funds. How much better for the amiable widow! By this means, perhaps, ce|libacy

<P>The rea&s;onings which your foreknowledge in|grafts on Bovile's future re&s;urrection, are excel|lent. But read the following, and the late&s;t intel|ligence, which was given me by an eye-witne&s;s of the fact, and if you cannot give as much credit to his te&s;timony as I do, then do not divulge it. "We were," &s;ays he, "off again&s;t the Azores when the Engli&s;h fleet hove in &s;ight. Notwith|&s;tanding our inferiority, it was the duty of our Admiral to protect the convoy, and he has done it. But when the &s;ignal of retreat was given, it was evident that the Pallas was not in a &s;ituation of obeying it. It was likewi&s;e true, that if they had continued the engagement half an hour longer, they might have gained the important advantage of di&s;engaging her from the Engli&s;h fleet, and entirely &s;aving the convoy. But in&s;tead of this, they left her expo&s;ed to the cro&s;s-fire of three frigates and a &s;hip of the line. Then the brave commander of the Pallas, zealous of wa&s;hing off the &s;tain which cowardice had imprinted on the French flag, with the enemy's blood, &s;u&s;tained, for a long time, a mo&s;t unequal combat. At the clo&s;e of the day his frigate was cut down to the water's edge, by the ince&s;&s;ant fire of the enemy, and ready to &s;ink. A few &s;ailors were &s;aved in the boat. But bound by the oath which obliges every Captain to remain in his &s;hip till the la&s;t extremity, the intrepid Bovile determined to bury him&s;elf and his &s;hip together in the waves. O cur&s;ed thir&s;t of gold! the avaricious

conquerors, in their greedine&s;s for plunder, pur|&s;ued our merchant fleet, and left a number of men to peri&s;h for want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. There were not &s;aved from the wreck of the Pallas more than &s;e|venty men: and, to complete our misfortunes, the Captain was not in the number of pri&s;oners. The vile enemies of this brave man have completely &s;ucceeded in their dete&s;table plots, and the unfortu|nate Bovile has peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>"But this dreadful &s;ucce&s;s has not a&s;&s;uaged their revengeful &s;pirits. They have put in at Terceira to repair the French &s;quadron, where they have held a council of war, di&s;graced the memory of Bovile, and, horrible to relate, have confi&s;cated his property."</P>
<P>I do not tran&s;cribe the reflections of my corre&s;|pondent, becau&s;e they might &s;ully my imagination. But here, Dolerval, are facts which &s;peak for them&s;elves. Let us now leave the&s;e gloomy &s;ub|jects, and refre&s;h our weary attention by viewing cheerful pictures.</P>
<P>To take it all in all, your late letter was void of common &s;en&s;e. It mu&s;t have been that when you wrote, you was a little crazy. It mu&s;t be &s;o. You have either become a fool, or you are in love. What can it be but &s;omething in your late jour|ney, of which you did not acquaint me? What can it be but that extraordinary adventure which gave you &s;uch a mixture of anxiety and &s;urpri&s;e? Come then, Dolerval, acknowledge the fact&mdash;ac|knowledge that there is &s;ome la&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fillete. This is u&s;ed &s;ometimes in a bad &s;en&s;e.</NOTE> on the carpet. Do not endeavour to be too di&s;crete: if you do, you will have rea&s;on to repent of it. It will not be &s;ufficient that fortune &s;hould throw you into the

way, unle&s;s you have &s;uch a guide as your inex|perience requires. Con&s;ider what advantage El|eanor has derived from my coun&s;els. Depend up|on it, my brother, that I have an equal friend&s;hip for you. Be not then &s;o unkind as to hide any of her affairs from me, nor any of yours. The af|fairs of your hearts I &s;hall govern with the ten|dere&s;t care. As circum&s;tances require&punc; I &s;hall in|&s;truct both of you in the be&s;t and readie&s;t means of arriving to the end propo&s;ed. Provided your &s;i&s;ter will not di&s;courage the a&s;&s;ailants, I will re|veal to her all the wiles of attack: and, as for you, I will enlighten you in all the little mimicries of defence. Thus will both of you, retrieving the time you have lo&s;t, attain to my experience in the career of happine&s;s, and the hopes of your &s;ucce&s;s already &s;oftens my misfortunes.</P>
<P>Yes, my brother, I al&s;o am in misfortune! I cannot hear any thing from Mademoi&s;elle de Ter|ville. A &s;py whom I keep in the neighbourhood of M. de Varmont, a&s;&s;ures me &s;he is not at Paris&punc; My good friend, therefore, did not run away with her. The little gip&s;y wanted no a&s;&s;i&s;tance in order to e&s;cape me. This matter acquires a good deal of probability, and it vexes me extremely. More than once have I &s;urpri&s;ed my&s;elf regretting the perfidious maid. Then, in milder mood, I tell my&s;elf that it is nothing le&s;s than a &s;erious attach|ment. This idea torments me. Oh! if ever I &s;hould find her again&mdash;if I &s;hould find her, I would hold her &s;o clo&s;ely that &s;he could not &s;tray from her happine&s;s!</P>
<P>In hopes of finding her, I have made an ac|quaintance with one in this city, who occupies &s;ome of my lei&s;ure hours. This affords me a little amu&s;ement, and that is all. I feel a void in the

<P>DEAR Emilia! what a mixture of horrible and con&s;oling narratives do I together re|ceive! What matter of extreme affliction and in|expre&s;&s;ible joy are united in this long &s;eries of let|ters, which I receive as the book of your de&s;tiny! Tho&s;e fearful &s;u&s;picions which appeared &s;o full of horror, that I &s;ometimes reproached my&s;elf for en|tertaining them, were but too well founded. In|famous mon&s;ter! when he boa&s;ted to me of the great riches your death would leave him, he pronounced your &s;entence! He departed, O bar|barous man! to take your life! When he bade me adieu, he departed to de&s;troy the mo&s;t amiable, the &s;weete&s;t, and mo&s;t excellent of women&mdash;his &s;i&s;ter and mine! O God! a God terrible to the
<PB N="34" REF="035743_0147_1006AF749F032DB0">
wicked, where are the puni&s;hments inflicted on the murderer who imbrued his hands in the blood of Abel? When will the bottomle&s;s pit be opened to &s;wallow the mon&s;ter which nature groans to bear? Where is thy lingering ju&s;tice? What withholds thine avenging hand? But my Emilia &s;till lives! To her, whil&s;t in the aby&s;s of &s;orrows and dan|ger, the Mo&s;t High extended his arm, and gra|ciou&s;ly drew her from thence. To his wonderful goodne&s;s do I owe the warme&s;t prai&s;es.</P>
<P>Yes, my &s;i&s;ter is yet in exi&s;tence. Happily for me, my eyes were a&s;&s;ured of it; happily for me, the characters of your dear hand&mdash;tho&s;e well known characters, had given me a certain proof that you was &s;till in being, before the perfidious mon&s;ter had come to rejoice at your death. On this very morning the wretch pre&s;umed to trouble my parlour with his pre&s;ence. Being de&s;irous of knowing what new enormities he could have in contemplation. I did my&s;elf &s;o much violence as to affront his a&s;pect. Ferocious tiger! what joy brightened in his &s;anguinary eye! He had ju&s;t re|ceived from Bre&s;t, and immediately brought to me, the verbal proce&s;s which proved the de&s;truction of the Centaure, and con&s;equently your tragical end. "Her hu&s;band," &s;aid he, "&s;oon followed her; the hero, of whom your father had &s;uch a high opinion, is dead. Yes, he is dead; and what may &s;eem worthy of remark, before dying he was di&s;|honored. Ju&s;tice has taken hold of his property; but that of his wife is &s;eized by di&s;tre&s;s. Thanks to the per&s;ecutions I have begun, her dowry will be given up, to remain &s;afely in my hands; &s;o that if &s;he &s;hould happen to be alive, and &s;hould ever return, &s;he may have it again." At this la&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ion, I could not re&s;train the indignation I felt,
<PB N="35" REF="035743_0148_1006AF77E54EEB28">
and cried out, "If ever &s;he returns&mdash;O barbarous man!"</P>
<P>At this moment I had well nigh betrayed both you and my&s;elf. But in a moment I became &s;en|&s;ible of our danger, and, in a lower voice, repeated, "If ever &s;he returns! O barbarous wretch!&mdash;then be &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>He mildly an&s;wered me, "that it would be agreeable enough to &s;ee you again; but it would always be di&s;agreeable to return &s;o much money." And then, to di&s;encumber him&s;elf of a multitude of papers, he called in his dome&s;tic, who was no other than Lafleur! At the &s;udden approach of this man, who had, as it were, held a &s;word to the brea&s;t of Emilia, I was &s;eized with horror; but &s;oon con&s;idering the mi&s;erable wretch as your de|liverer, I was overcome with &s;entiments of tender|ne&s;s: and had not the grates prevented me, per|haps I &s;hould have fallen at his feet, and in exce&s;|&s;ive gratitude have thanked him for not &s;hutting his ears again&s;t the voice of humanity. In the mean time, whether he perceived the impre&s;&s;ion that the &s;ight of him made upon me, or whether a view of Emilia's &s;i&s;ter affected him deeply, I can|not &s;ay; but Lafleur lo&s;t all countenance. With a pale vi&s;age he leaned again&s;t the wall, and at length &s;at down ready to faint. His ma&s;ter ob|&s;erved it without emotion, and a&s;ked him "whe|ther he was &s;ubject to &s;uch fits of weakne&s;s?" The unfortunate dome&s;tic an&s;wered &s;everal times, but with a faltering voice, "that he was not."</P>
<P>"So much the better," cried the inhuman Var|mont, "for if the fits of your di&s;order &s;hould be|come more frequent, it would be nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould part."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="035743_0149_1006AF79AFCB4A60">Upon hearing this, fearing I could not re&s;train my indignation, I left him.</P>
<P>Thus your a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in is about to receive the fruits of his iniquity. In a little time he will enrich him|&s;elf with your &s;poils: and, as I cannot prevent it, I mu&s;t calmly endure it. Alas! of all the ble&s;&s;ings the pre&s;ent life can be&s;tow, there is none re&s;erved but your life. And if I &s;hould indi&s;cretely betray you, I &s;hould die with de&s;pair. Be tranquil, my charming &s;i&s;ter, for I would &s;ooner lo&s;e my life than reveal the &s;ecret of your exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>With regard to your real &s;ituation, I know not what advice to give you. What information can you expect from my inexperience? I could not, on this occa&s;ion, forbear con&s;ulting a lady in the chamber, who is my friend. She is willing to re|ceive your letters, and hand them to me. Tell me whether you think this a dangerous expedient.</P>
<P>To conclude; neglect no precaution for pre&s;erv|ing your &s;ecurity; redouble your vigilance; care|fully conceal your exi&s;tence from every eye. Sum|mon all your courage to re&s;i&s;t your misfortunes. And who does not &s;tand in need of fortitude? This life is one continued &s;cene of trials and &s;orrow. Ah! if I &s;hould pre&s;ent you with a picture of tho&s;e which a&s;&s;ault me in my confinement, per|haps you would find that Juliette, all wretched as &s;he is, cannot be more &s;o than the unhappy Ce|lina!</P>

<P>OH let him take my riches! nobody will pre|vent him. I &s;hall beware of expo&s;ing him to the alternative of re&s;toring them, or again en|deavouring to de&s;troy me. Oh, let him take them! But may he, and it is the la&s;t wi&s;h which the cries of nature &s;hall extort from me, tho&s;e cries which he has refu&s;ed to hear; may he never find any plea&s;ure in enjoying them; may he always be tormented with the in&s;upportable remembrance of the crime by which he obtained them; may keen remor&s;e take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart, and prey upon it; may he, in a frightful di&s;order of mind, often hear my plaintive voice; in the gloom of night, may he &s;ee my bloody &s;hade &s;tanding clo&s;e at his &s;ide; and may he, in fine, become the mo&s;t wretched of mortals in this life, and, at la&s;t, obtain pardon of God!</P>
<P>Never let me hear from him again, except to inform me of his repentance.</P>
<P>Beware al&s;o of con&s;ulting that lady who&s;e coun|&s;els and a&s;&s;i&s;tance you propo&s;ed. It would be ra|ther perilous, without a known nece&s;&s;ity, to admit any per&s;on to &s;hare in our confidence. Adver&s;ity is a &s;evere ma&s;ter. It &s;eems to have undertaken the ta&s;k of in&s;tructing my &s;ad and inexperienced youth. By rude le&s;&s;ons, and in a &s;hort time, has it enlightened my ignorance, improved my rea&s;on, and formed my judgment. By rea&s;on of the di&s;|tru&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="035743_0151_1006AF8199E42898">
with which it in&s;pires me, on difficult occa|&s;ions, I con&s;ult my&s;elf alone.</P>
<P>And even at the pre&s;ent time, I begin to perceive the error of de&s;pairing in my&s;elf. I perceive there is no impo&s;&s;ibility of finding per&s;ons whom I can in&s;pire with &s;entiments of humanity. M. Dolerval has been with us almo&s;t every evening &s;ince I fir&s;t &s;aw him. And when I &s;uppo&s;ed my company would incommode him, or prove di&s;agreeable, I was greatly deceived. Quite the contrary&mdash;he con&s;iders it a fortunate circum&s;tance that I abide with my uncle. Sometimes I hear him compli|menting the Curate on the happine&s;s of having his niece at his hou&s;e&mdash;"A niece," &s;aid he, "&s;o beau|tiful and engaging." Another circum&s;tance which gives me equal encouragement, is to ob&s;erve my uncle's kindne&s;s towards me daily increa&s;ing. If I &s;hould undertake to inform you the many ways he has of &s;howing his regard for me, and the kind at|tentions he pays me, I &s;hould never end. There is no kind of labour but which he fears will fatigue Juliette, nor is there any provi&s;ion which he thinks good enough for her. If I would &s;uffer it, he would ruin him&s;elf for my &s;ake! I really believe, if I would con&s;ent to it, that he would &s;o far take the charge of hou&s;ehold affairs, that I &s;hould have nothing to do but walk, eat my u&s;ual meals, and &s;leep from morning till night.</P>
<P>Perhaps you would be willing to learn how we &s;pend our days. Of the mornings I have not much to &s;ay; they are chiefly &s;pent in dome&s;tic affairs, and, con&s;equently, are not very intere&s;ting; but after dinner, M. Dolerval comes, and finds us em|ployed in the garden. My uncle works there in|deed; but how can his niece do any thing? If I take the rake or the &s;pade, M. Sevin is offended,
<PB N="39" REF="035743_0152_1006AF83688B3DF0">
and tells me I am not &s;trong enough; if I under|take to prop the plants, M. Dolerval prevents me, and pretends it will hurt my hands: and, if you will believe me, he will not even allow me to water the flowers. Now I think of it, they &s;ome|times gather flowers for me. M. Dolerval collects a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bouquet.</NOTE>bunch of them every evening. And it mu&s;t be acknowledged the one he collects and binds toge|ther for me, is better compo&s;ed, interwoven more agreeably, and with more grace, than the one M. Sevin obliges me to wear every morning.</P>
<P>When the day declines, the dew incommodes us and we return to the hou&s;e. The good Curate then &s;ups, or prates in his u&s;ual manner. But M. Dolerval, more than any of us, &s;upports and en|livens the conver&s;ation. He relates the plea&s;ures and incidents of his childhood, the recreations and employments of his youth, with much ingenuity. The details he enters upon derive their chief in|tere&s;t from the manner in which they are repre|&s;ented. You cannot form an idea of the lu&s;tre which his conver&s;ation gives to the minute&s;t reci|tals. And I cannot but think he con&s;iders my opinion to be of &s;ome con&s;equence. Whenever he enters into conver&s;ation, though he always &s;peaks in an engaging manner, he never &s;eems to be &s;atisfied with him&s;elf until he &s;ees in my coun|tenance an air of approbation. At length he directs his di&s;cour&s;e to me. He que&s;tions me con|cerning the place of my birth, my parentage, and the fir&s;t objects of my attachment. But do not think it vain curio&s;ity on his part, or done merely to pa&s;s an idle hour. O far from it! there is no room for &s;uch an opinion. You can evidently &s;ee
<PB N="40" REF="035743_0153_1006AF86E81D8418">
that it is out of pure intere&s;t for your&s;elf that he thus que&s;tions you. And now ob&s;erve, my &s;i&s;ter; when his inquiries become too embarra&s;&s;ing, my uncle comes to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But M. Dolerval &s;eems always to regret that the an&s;wer comes not from me.</P>
<P>Thus our evenings glide away with inconceive|able &s;wiftne&s;s. Surpri&s;ing as it may &s;eem, the clock always &s;trikes twelve at night &s;oon after M. Dolerval goes away. I have rea&s;on to think, Ce|lina, from my pre&s;ent experience, that there is no &s;ituation in life, however unhappy it may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear, which does not, in it&s;elf, afford &s;ome compen&s;ation. To take it all in all, I can a&s;&s;ure you that my own begins to &s;eem quite &s;upportable.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Tours,
<DATE>July 19, 1782.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I COULD not, my brother, con&s;i&s;tently &s;hew your la&s;t letter to Madame Florival. For in that letter you treated our worthy &s;i&s;ter with ex|treme irreverence and indecency. This &s;urpri&s;es me the more, becau&s;e I have often heard it affirmed of the greate&s;t libertines, that even in the mid&s;t of their mad career, they would always pre&s;erve &s;ome re&s;pect for a virtuous character. Pardon me, Murville, for it would really give me pain to of|fend you; but to read the in&s;ulting expre&s;&s;ions you wrote concerning Eleanor, is more than I can bear. Has &s;he not, by long and painful trials,
<PB N="41" REF="035743_0154_1006AF93C915F168">
merited a better treatment? Rather than thus ra&s;hly condemn her, you ought, at lea&s;t, to &s;u&s;pend your judgment. But &s;ince you &s;eem to require new te&s;|timonies of the merit &s;he &s;till de&s;erves, you may be a&s;&s;ured it will one day be in my power to produce them&punc; and then, my brother, you will be forced to acknowledge the reality of faithful love.</P>
<P>Perhaps the time may al&s;o come when you will not &s;u&s;pect me of delighting in ba&s;e inclinations, nor hope to in&s;pire me with &s;uch &s;entiments as you have recommended. It is true, that if I &s;hould hereafter find an object on whom I &s;hould place my affections, it may be one of that cla&s;s which the men of the world call inferior, an object of their eternal di&s;dain. It may be a girl whom blind fate has placed in a humble condition; but who, between the low &s;ituation in which &s;he is placed, and the exalted qualities of her mind, would form &s;uch a perfect contra&s;t, that even in this humble &s;tate, &s;he would appear to be as much di&s;placed as many others would, though removed from the mid&s;t of their grandeur. A brilliant education &s;hould not have nurtured her in the &s;entiments of &s;uperior &s;elf-excellence, which are, in early life, in&s;tilled into the minds of people in an elevated rank; but &s;he &s;hould have the inward con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of every thing prai&s;e-worthy or blameable; &s;he &s;hould have that true &s;en&s;e of an exqui&s;ite delicacy, which, without &s;tudy, would direct her mind to every noble truth; &s;imple nature &s;hould have given her without labour or expence, tho&s;e rare accom|pli&s;hments, which your ladies of high rank &s;o &s;el|dom obtain by all the efforts of art. She &s;hould not only po&s;&s;e&s;s a ta&s;te for u&s;eful employments, a love of &s;ub&s;tantial virtues, and an aptne&s;s for im|proving every amiable talent, but &s;hould, in reality,
<PB N="42" REF="035743_0155_1006AF9ECDB31098">
have more true nobility in her &s;oul, than nature often be&s;tows on the daughters of Kings. In fine, &s;he &s;hould not atract attention by the vain &s;hew of her outward appearance, nor the extravagance of her demands; but &s;hould appear, when dre&s;&s;ed in white linen, and a ru&s;e on her brea&s;t, more beautiful than the riche&s;t ladies decked with dia|monds and purple. The beginning of her adole|&s;cence &s;hould not only &s;hine with the winning at|tractions of that age, but the brighter charms of the age which &s;ucceeds. She &s;hould, in a &s;upreme degree, combine in her per&s;on, not only the allure|ments, dignity and graces of beauty, but even po&s;|&s;e&s;s its trea&s;ures. It there is, in reality, &s;uch a per|&s;on as the one I have here painted with a thou&s;and attractions, or, what is &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing, the one you would give the mean epithet of a la&s;s, while I &s;hould e&s;teem her the queen of the world, and would fain make her the idol of my heart; do you think, Murville, that in order to gain her, I &s;hould have recour&s;e to your delu&s;ive in&s;tructions, at the ri&s;k of your fatal experience? Ah, Murville! what in&s;tructions can I receive from you that are worth the pains of learning them? After contem|plating your le&s;&s;ons &s;o repeatedly, I am &s;till inca|pable or plea&s;ing any ladies but &s;uch as would de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P>No, if I &s;hould ere long feel the power of an at|tachment &s;ufficient to bind me for life, you are not the per&s;on I would choo&s;e for a confident. Elea|nor alone &s;eems worthy of &s;uch a confidence, and to her alone do I owe it. Neverthele&s;s, before re|quiting her confidence with confe&s;&s;ions &s;imilar to tho&s;e with which &s;he honors me, I &s;hould wi&s;h to be certain that I could, like her, pre&s;erve a pa&s;&s;ion pure and unalterable, through the trials of ab&s;ence

and time, though di&s;couraged by un&s;uitable cir|cum&s;tances, and counteracted by unfavourable events; I &s;hould wi&s;h to be certain, not that the object of my affections merited them (for we cannot, I think, truly love a per&s;on whom we do not e&s;teem); but to be certain of being capable my|&s;elf of always admiring even that per&s;on whom I could never obtain. What a reproach it would be if I &s;hould fail in receiving le&s;&s;ons of delicacy and fidelity from any per&s;on with whom I am conver|&s;ant! Above all, what a reproach it would be, if afterwards I &s;hould conceive a pa&s;&s;ion which might be di&s;couraged by common difficulties! How could I, in &s;uch ca&s;e, endure the reproaches of Eleanor, who &s;o con&s;tantly pre&s;erves her affections, not|with&s;tanding her regret and privation? How could I bear to hear her accu&s;e me of having, even in her pre&s;ence, di&s;graced the name of faithful love?</P>
<P>But let us proceed to the only article in your letter, in which I feel intere&s;ted. This, unfortu|nately, is the only one in which we are agreed. I could not a&s;&s;ent to it but with reluctance. It &s;eems that my hopes re&s;pecting the lover of my &s;i&s;|ter were too vi&s;ionary. The melancholy details you have given me, &s;eem to prove, with great cer|tainty, that Bovile is no more.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, my brother, I have to de&s;ire your pardon for the freedom which has dictated my an&s;wer. I am &s;en&s;ible that a difference of opinions, when it re&s;pects real &s;entiments, may, in time, break friend&s;hip. But my friend&s;hip for you &s;hall never be de&s;troyed; becau&s;e I per&s;i&s;t in believ|ing, with Madame Florival, that there remains &s;o much natural goodne&s;s in your heart, that at &s;ome future time you may be inclined to acknowledge your errors. This we both hope and believe, not|with&s;tanding

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. Emilia de Varmont to Celina.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>St. Cyr,
<DATE>July 24, 1782.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YES, my dear Celina, my uncle is in truth an excellent man; and I have become more reconciled to my new &s;ituation. There has been &s;omething in him which greatly di&s;gu&s;ted me: It was that almo&s;t childi&s;h gaiety which every trifle excited in him. His petulant cheerfulne&s;s and my &s;ilent &s;adne&s;s, formed an unlucky contra&s;t. Often have I perceived that my &s;orrow was increa&s;ed with his joy. Whether M. Sevin has perceived the un|comfortable &s;ituation of his niece, I cannot affirm; but certain I am, that he has changed the tone of his voice and his behaviour. I would not &s;ay that he was either fretful, or, in any wi&s;e, ill natured. But his good humour was only moderated; at pre|&s;ent it is le&s;s boi&s;terous, more re&s;erved, more plea|&s;ant and attractive; in fine, almo&s;t as engaging as that of M. Dolerval. Perhaps it proceeds from this cau&s;e: that M. Sevin takes, by degrees, a tinc|ture of the happy di&s;po&s;ition of his friend, without being in&s;en&s;ible of it him&s;elf. There is another re|mark which I have made concerning my uncle, which &s;eems no le&s;s flattering than the former. You doubtle&s;s remember M. Sevin's favourite
<PB N="45" REF="035743_0158_1006AFA6A9D820B0">
phra&s;e&mdash;that expre&s;&s;ion, which, on the day I en|tered his hou&s;e, &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed me, and with re&s;pect to the equivocal &s;en&s;e of which I was well &s;atisfied, when he, with unparalleled candour, in a re&s;pectful manner, made known the pains of his condition. Prote&s;ting, at the &s;ame time&punc; that the expre&s;&s;ions of his unea&s;ine&s;s had nothing in them which re&s;pected me in particular, &s;ince (to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion) he &s;aluted every vi&s;itant with the &s;ame words. He &s;eemed to repeat them to no purpo&s;e, without intermi&s;&s;ion or di&s;cretion; and, notwith&s;tanding what he &s;aid to dimini&s;h my fears, tho&s;e tire&s;ome exclamations gave me a &s;ecret di&s;plea&s;ure. You will, therefore, learn with &s;ati&s;|faction, that my uncle corrects him&s;elf of this fault. At pre&s;ent, his complaints do not e&s;cape him but when his heart is too full to contain them. Still does he endeavour to &s;pare me the pain of hearing it. Neverthele&s;s, I can di&s;cover by his melancholy a&s;pect, deeply pen&s;ive, when the &s;entiment of his evils, becoming more lively, is ready to force his complaints from him. Then, as he is &s;en&s;ible of its approach, he ri&s;es abruptly and leaves me, le&s;t I &s;hould hear him; for fear of afflicting me, he goes away to groan this phra&s;e: "They ought to marry the prie&s;ts." I &s;ay groan, bacau&s;e no other expre&s;&s;ion &s;o well &s;uits the moving inflexion of his voice when he articulates the&s;e words. Then, and then only, do I perceive in his voice that tone of tenderne&s;s and &s;orrow, the accents of a pa&s;&s;ionate heart, &s;o well imitated by M. Dolerval, when he &s;ings a plaintive &s;ong.</P>
<P>Now I think of it, the two friends, ye&s;terday, &s;pent &s;ome time at mu&s;ic. I do not &s;peak of the Curate, and his favourite in&s;trument, but of M. Dolerval, who played &s;everal &s;onata in a very
<PB N="46" REF="035743_0159_1006AFAEBB441A98">
agreeable manner. My uncle afterwards attempted to &s;ing; but his &s;ongs afforded me no amu&s;ement. They con&s;i&s;ted of ariettas and roundos, entirely gay, or di&s;gu&s;tingly merry. If the words had not been, for the mo&s;t part, vulgar and in&s;ignificant, the airs would have plea&s;ed me tolerably well. You know how much I prefer romances. They have &s;omething in them tender and plaintive, that at once affect and captivate the heart. It &s;eems &s;trange that M. Dolerval always &s;uits his airs &s;o well to my fancy. He has &s;ung one mo&s;t capti|vating! and how delightfully did he &s;ing it! what expre&s;&s;ion in his features and voice! His voice is indeed mo&s;t charming! It charmed my heart and melted it to tenderne&s;s, to &s;uch a degree that I could never be weary of hearing it. He ended, however, &s;ooner than I could wi&s;h, by the follow|ing couplets, to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This air is &s;aid to be lo&s;t.</NOTE>air which I herewith &s;end you.</P>

<P>WHETHER the &s;ong of M. Dolerval will affect you as it does me, I cannot tell; But, for my part, it plea&s;ed me exceedingly. His &s;ong I call it, becau&s;e I believe him to be the au|thor of it. You may be ready to a&s;k me why I attribute it to him? It is becau&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e there is &s;omething in the words&mdash;Ah! it is becau&s;e he was embarra&s;&s;ed when I told him I did not remember to have ever &s;een any part of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It has &s;ince appeared in the New-Year's Gift of Polyhym|nia, (les Etrennes de Polymnie) but with &s;ome alterations &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion. It appears to have been a theft which M. Louvet &s;uppo&s;ed, at that time, he could commit with im|punity on M. Dolerval. But now it is all di&s;covered!</P>
<P>This is a note of the French editor, who humorou&s;ly ac|cu&s;es M. Louvet of theft, but only means to in&s;inuate that M. Louvet was the author of the &s;ong which was publi&s;hed in the New-Year's Gift of Polyhymnia.</P></NOTE> "You may not," an&s;wered he, "learn all of it." But he was out of countenance, and &s;eemed to tremble whil&s;t he &s;ung it&mdash;and blu&s;hed on hearing me applaud it&mdash;and when I de&s;ired him to leave it with me, he &s;eemed to be well plea&s;ed. All the&s;e circum&s;tances made me &s;uppo&s;e him to be the author. My uncle, however, did not e&s;teem it at all. O let him &s;ing his vulgar airs and welcome! He &s;hall not have my &s;ong until I have learned it perfectly. And that time, my &s;i&s;ter, will &s;oon come. For in|&s;tantly after receiving it, I trilled over the la&s;t
<PB N="49" REF="035743_0162_1006AFBC02FDCAF8">
ver&s;es almo&s;t in&s;tinctively, hardly knowing what I did.</P>
<P>My imprudence had well-nigh betrayed me. For &s;everal minutes I could &s;carcely re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire of &s;inging in my turn, and &s;itting down at the piano. This fanta&s;y, &s;uppo&s;ing it was one, had nothing in it which might be called blameable: for if it is good not to derive vanity from its advantages, we &s;hould not any longer affect to di&s;dain it. You know that in the number of talents we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and for which our father doated on us in &s;pite of Madame de Varmont, mu&s;ic was one which was highly e&s;teemed, and one in which I had con&s;ider|able &s;ucce&s;s. M. Dolerval plays tolerably well, and &s;ings delightfully. However, I have the vanity to think my voice as good as his; and &s;urely he is not my equal at the piano. This, without ex|treme &s;elf-conceit, I can &s;afely boa&s;t of to you, and this is what I &s;aid to my&s;elf in a low voice. Greatly tempted to meddle with the concert, I an|ticipated, with plea&s;ure, the &s;urpri&s;e of M.&mdash; I would &s;ay the &s;urpri&s;e of the two friends. Yet &s;e|veral reflections inclined me to de&s;i&s;t. Is it ad|vi&s;able, thought I, to di&s;cover my knowledge of mu&s;ic to the good Curate, and have the appear|ance of having intended to deceive him five days ago, when I thought be&s;t to hide my talents from him? Would there not, in all this, be &s;omething very di&s;obliging to M. Sevin? The&s;e con&s;iderations determined me, though reluctantly, to take the pa&s;&s;ive part, and prudently did &s;o, until a &s;trange propen&s;ity led me, without thinking of it, to trill the la&s;t lines of the new &s;ong.</P>
<P>But the &s;urpri&s;e of the two friends &s;oon warned me of my error, and it was a fortunate circum|&s;tance that I only found &s;ounds almo&s;t inarticulate,
<PB N="50" REF="035743_0163_1006AFBF71B6D650">
&s;o that I could &s;till deny my being a mu&s;ician. M. Dolerval urged me earne&s;tly to try to &s;ing tho&s;e words to the tune, and &s;eemed as if he was determined not to di&s;pen&s;e with my refu&s;al; &s;o that, at la&s;t, I was obliged to make the attempt. But I took care to &s;ing without method, and much like a &s;cholar who is ju&s;t beginning in the gamut. This, in the end, proved to be an unnece&s;&s;ary caution; for, at the in&s;tant I began to &s;ing, my voice be|came trembling and di&s;gui&s;ed. Yet the compli|ments they paid me on the occa&s;ion were as great as if I had &s;ung di&s;tinctly, and without faltering. They a&s;&s;ured me I ought not to neglect cultivat|ing &s;uch a commendable talent. M. Sevin renew|ed his offers of in&s;tructing me; but M. Dolerval a&s;ked the preference with that per&s;ua&s;ive and en|gaging tone of voice which is &s;o natural to him; &s;o that I found my&s;elf in perplexity as to determin|ing which of the two friends &s;hould have the pre|ference in teaching me what neither of them knew &s;o well as my&s;elf. O fie! I &s;hall&mdash;I &s;hall &s;tay too long&mdash;I&mdash;but it &s;eems to me a long time &s;ince we took dinner. This is the moment when&mdash;when I cannot di&s;pen&s;e with being pre&s;ent.

<P>I HAVE this day received your letter. I &s;ee, with &s;en&s;ibility, my &s;i&s;ter, that from the cha|racter I have given my uncle, you conceive a great e&s;teem for him. There are, as you have ju&s;tly remarked, but few men in his condition of a cha|racter at once &s;o good and amiable. In the mean time it &s;eems a little &s;trange, that, when &s;peaking of his friend, you prai&s;e him no farther than &s;aying, that I &s;eem to have a peculiar friend&s;hip for him. Indeed I have, my &s;i&s;ter; becau&s;e he merits it! becau&s;e there is no other per&s;on &s;o worthy of it as he! And were you in my place, Celina, tell me I pray you, could you forbear having a great attach|ment
<PB N="52" REF="035743_0165_1006AFCC0334A208">
for him? What! have I not done him ju&s;tice in my letters? Have I neglected to de&s;cribe him to you &s;uch as he is? If &s;o, I have been guilty of an unpardonable omi&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>I have not, I &s;uppo&s;e, told you any thing of his talents or his beauty, nor the many external quali|ties which render him &s;o &s;hining. For none of the&s;e qualities can be very intere&s;ting to you nor me. But for me to neglect pre&s;enting you with the enchanting picture of his innocent manners, or his &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition; to forbear from extolling, according to their merits, every quality of his heart, or every virtue of his noble mind, would be un|pardonable. This would be a piece of inju&s;tice of which I never expected to be guilty.</P>
<P>And is it not &s;urpri&s;ing that this young man, who would lo&s;e nothing by the mo&s;t rigid examination, has &s;o much indulgence for the failings of others, that one would &s;ometimes term it weakne&s;s? So extraordinary is his mildne&s;s, that he will neither give any cau&s;e of offence to his greate&s;t enemy, nor hold re&s;entment again&s;t the injuries of a friend. And is it not an uncommon circum&s;tance, that the extreme &s;en&s;ibility of his heart adds to the unalter|able &s;weetne&s;s of his temper? I will now give you a trait of his character entirely new.</P>
<P>My uncle, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is entirely another man; &s;o that I was too ha&s;ty in felicitating my&s;elf on account of the change in his conduct. This revolution in his behaviour has not &s;topped at the degree which I could have de&s;ired. A melancholy, at fir&s;t very mild, took place of the gaiety which was quite extinct; but now a profound &s;adne&s;s and gloomy vexation have &s;ucceeded. M. Doler+val has never &s;een him in &s;uch a deplorable &s;tate as the pre&s;ent. And if the inconvenience of this
<PB N="53" REF="035743_0166_1006AFCF209B55F8">
&s;trange alteration affected none but me, I could not but pity my unfortunate uncle, and do every thing in my power to comfort him. Why does he, in the &s;evere&s;t turns of his melancholy di&s;order, never become vexed with his niece, with whom, perhaps, he has a right to be offended? On the contrary, why does he lay the whole burden of his ill hu|mour upon his generous friend, who &s;o tenderly compa&s;&s;ionates his inward &s;orrow, and who, alas! vainly endeavours, like me, to di&s;cover its cau&s;e?</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, almo&s;t twelve o'clock at night, they had not opened the collection of &s;ongs which M. Dolerval intended to make u&s;e of in the evening. My uncle &s;trange to tell, &s;eemed quite indifferent about this amu&s;ement. M. Dolerval &s;uppo&s;ed he might, once only &s;ing my favourite &s;ong (I would &s;ay his), and &s;ung it: and although it is very &s;hort, my uncle &s;eemed to wait with impatience till it was ended. But this was not all! Ob&s;erve now his a&s;toni&s;hing caprice! When the young man bid us good night, M. Sevin, who, during the whole evening, &s;carcely ob&s;erved any part of the mu&s;ic, que&s;tioned his friend with a tone of bitterne&s;s, and &s;aid, "Will Madame Florival never honor us any more with her vi&s;its? Has &s;he &s;worn never to come again to my hou&s;e to favour us with her mu&s;ic?"</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e my &s;i&s;ter," an&s;wered he, "&s;he is at pre&s;ent much occupied and embarra&s;&s;ed."&mdash;M. Dolerval was going to continue, but he was bri&s;kly interrupted. "She is not occupied with her cha|grins," &s;aid M. Sevin.&mdash;"Mu&s;t we not &s;uppo&s;e," replied her brother with emotion, "by the tone with which you expre&s;s your &s;entiments, that you are offended with her?"</P>
<P>"In fact," cried he, "I am at lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed with her conduct! I may well be &s;urpri&s;ed, when
<PB N="54" REF="035743_0167_1006AFD440D77FF8">
I have &s;een a woman, not above &s;ix weeks ago, ready to die with grief for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, appear &s;o &s;oon to be perfectly comforted. What then &s;hall we think of a woman's attachment, if it cannot for more than a month &s;urvive its object? What would you have us think of &s;orrows which &s;he does not care to pre&s;erve any longer? When|ever I think of this, I have le&s;s rea&s;on to lament that they do not marry the prie&s;ts."</P>
<P>On hearing &s;uch uncivil expre&s;&s;ions, you would expect to &s;ee M. Dolerval overcome with vex|ation. But in&s;tead of being offended, in an affect|ing manner he &s;aid: "O my friend! what do I hear? what injury have I done you?" And, at the &s;ame time, offered M. Sevin his hand. But, &s;trange to relate, M. Sevin, in&s;tead of flying into his arms for reconciliation, only &s;tepped backwards. For my part, I could not patiently endure it! But no|thing can alter the mild di&s;po&s;ition of this young man. He then retired deeply afflicted. Yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, whil&s;t I think of it again, that I am certain there was not in his conduct the lea&s;t &s;ign of anger.</P>
<P>"Good night Juliette," &s;aid the Curate after the young man went away.&mdash;"My uncle, he's gone away very &s;orrowful."</P>
<P>"Well, the words are gone from me, and what would you have me do?"</P>
<P>"But he will never return," replied I.</P>
<P>"Never return!" repeated he with unea&s;ine&s;s. And then, in a mild voice, he continued: "You are too ea&s;ily alarmed. Be comforted, Juliette, be comforted: he will return. I do not often treat him &s;o ill. But have you not, my niece, given him a kind and di&s;tingui&s;hed reception? Why did you cau&s;e him to endure the pains of my erroneous conduct? Yet I know him too well to &s;uppo&s;e he

will long hold his re&s;entment on account of my &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion. Take courage, he will come again, I promi&s;e you. 'Tis I, my dear girl, who promi&s;e you this. Good night&mdash;I know, my girl, that I am &s;ad, peevi&s;h and in&s;upportable! Be wil|ling&mdash;O be willing to make me otherwi&s;e! Pity me, and let Dolerval al&s;o both pity and pardon me! Do you under&s;tand me, Juliette? Let him pardon me, I pray you!"</P>
<P>Then he left me in tears, much affected with his &s;udden and unexpected repentance. Now, let him &s;ay what he will, I &s;hall be in perpetual anx|iety. I am afraid M. Dolerval will never come again. There was not, in all that was &s;aid on that occa&s;ion, any thing which hurt him &s;o &s;en|&s;ibly as the abu&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions &s;poken again&s;t his &s;i&s;ter. But now all is well; he has returned, and much &s;ooner than u&s;ual: And from the greate&s;t di&s;tance he could &s;ee my uncle, he ran to him. My uncle tried to &s;peak and make &s;ome apologies; but he tenderly embraced him, and would not &s;uf|fer him to do it.</P>
<P>What think you! What can you think of all this, Celina? I wi&s;h you would an&s;wer me with|out delay.</P>

<P>EMILIA, you did not at all under&s;tand the meaning of my la&s;t letter; but I well under|&s;tood the import of yours. In your expre&s;&s;ions I perceive &s;ymptoms of that &s;trange pa&s;&s;ion which ob&s;cures the better judgment; whil&s;t friend&s;hip, that coolly reflects, and con&s;iders at a di&s;tance, is capable of enlightening the mo&s;t timid inexperience. Who could have thought that it would ever have appertained to Celina, abandoned to the ignorance of the cloi&s;ter, to remove the thick veil from the eyes of Emilia, which &s;he, while &s;urrounded with the light and experience of the world, had permit|ted to cover them?</P>
<P>Poor deluded &s;i&s;ter! thou art going blindly along in a way over&s;pread with innumerable &s;nares, and each &s;ucceeding &s;tep expo&s;es thee more than the former! Forbear, forbear, I conjure you! Give your&s;elf a moment's recollection. Examine your heart with impartiality. Strive, without prejudice, to an&s;wer the que&s;tions I &s;hall propo&s;e for your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Whatever events may take place, you will never, never forget your generous hu&s;band. The re|membrance of his genero&s;ity can never be effaced from your memory. You had conceived for your hu&s;band much e&s;teem, a lively gratitude, and re|&s;pectful friend&s;hip; but, at pre&s;ent, what do you think, or what do you &s;ay concerning Bovile?</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="035743_0170_1006AFE119BC9B98">At pre&s;ent, for it will be more ea&s;y for you to judge by compari&s;on&mdash;what do you at pre&s;ent think, or what do you &s;ay of young Dolerval? Whence proceed tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;tic eulogies you lavi&s;h upon him? What name &s;hall we give to that &s;pecies of enthu&s;ia&s;m with which he in&s;pires you? In &s;hort, what el&s;e could you think, or what could you &s;ay more, if he had in&s;pired you with what is called love? With love, my &s;i&s;ter! the very word &s;hould make you tremble. Never|thele&s;s, you mu&s;t not be too much di&s;couraged at your &s;ituation. Methinks it is &s;till in your power to return to your duty.</P>
<P>O Emilia! the deare&s;t of &s;i&s;ters! methinks I be|hold the precipice before thee, and would fain turn thee from it! When, for the purpo&s;e of e&s;caping it, I have recour&s;e to thy wi&s;dom and prudence, to that love of virtue which will in&s;pire thee, I doubt not but thou wilt form the be&s;t re&s;olutions. Provided the danger is not hidden, I &s;hall feel ea&s;y. Feel ea&s;y! O, no! do not think &s;o&mdash;I cannot feel &s;o whil&s;t I behold &s;o many new &s;orrows added to tho&s;e which already oppre&s;s my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall I &s;ay of this fatal pa&s;&s;ion of love? Was it de&s;igned to make wretched the whole hu|man race? Why &s;hould it delight in tormenting tho&s;e hearts which &s;hould never feel its fatal power with a re&s;tle&s;s and anxious de&s;ire? As for you, my dear Emilia, you have probably known its effects too &s;oon for your happine&s;s; but it is, perhaps, for my eternal languor, that I have &s;worn never to know them.

<P>MERCIFUL God! what a &s;udden ray of light thou ha&s;t thrown into the dark delu|&s;ive road in which I walked with full confidence! Have not the cruel pa&s;&s;ions of others rendered my lot &s;ufficiently deplorable? Mu&s;t I be doomed to &s;truggle with a criminal pa&s;&s;ion that has taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart? Was it not enough for me to become an object of pity? And to complete my wretchedne&s;s, mu&s;t I become an object of con|tempt? Oh, Bovile! mo&s;t generous of hu&s;bands! my gratitude for thy benevolent deeds has &s;o &s;oon peri&s;hed in my memory! The &s;entiment which thy virtues merited, and which was due from me, they did not obtain; but &s;oon, ah, how &s;oon was it given to a &s;tranger! Alas! thy memory is already di&s;honored! whil&s;t, as it were, upon thy tomb, &s;carcely clo&s;ed, I am affected with a criminal pa&s;|&s;ion!</P>
<P>Conceive, my dear Celina, my exce&s;&s;ive grief and &s;urpri&s;e. This day, for the fir&s;t time, I was made &s;en&s;ible of my ingratitude, not only towards my hu&s;band, but towards my &s;i&s;ter. Whil&s;t your ever affectionate and ever vigilant friend&s;hip watch|ed over me, my ba&s;e egoti&s;m &s;carcely gave me time to remember you. Sen&s;ele&s;s mortal!

<P>YOU will doubtle&s;s ob&s;erve, Celina, by the date of this letter, that I retired to my apart|ment this evening &s;ooner than u&s;ual. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e M. Dolerval has already gone, and my uncle &s;ent me hither. I take advantage of this cir|cum&s;tance to tell you &s;ome happy news. It &s;eems to me that this morning I partook too much of your apprehen&s;ions. I am well convinced that I am far from loving the young man as much as we feared. The more I reflect upon it, the better I am con|vinced that, as yet, I have only yielded, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the impre&s;&s;ion he &s;trove to make upon my heart. I have rewarded his civility, his atten|tion and &s;olicitude, with a grateful return, and this is all. But even in &s;uch a proceeding, I am &s;en|&s;ible there might be &s;ome danger, and promi&s;e to be more cautious in future.</P>

&s;atisfied with the motives which have enabled me to change my opinion, and give me more confi|dence in my&s;elf. For two days pa&s;t, the&s;e gentle|men have had very lengthy, my&s;terious, and ani|mated conferences together. They &s;peak in a low voice, move at a di&s;tance, and avoid me. This piece of unpolitene&s;s at fir&s;t &s;eemed quite intoler|able; but &s;oon afterwards I was &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed by their endle&s;s whi&s;pering. I perceived that they feared more and more to admit me into the &s;ecret of their conferences. They al&s;o afflicted me ex|ceedingly with a di&s;tru&s;t that &s;eemed quite uncivil. However, they at length returned, but were af|fected with a joy which they could not well di&s;|&s;emble. The&s;e marks of indifference for my un|happy circum&s;tances have not e&s;caped my notice. They have done &s;inging my favourite &s;ong, and now &s;ing the following one, with which you are well acquainted:
<Q><L>"Il faut attendre avec patience,</L>
<L>"Le jour de demain e&s;t an biau jour:</L>
<L>"Grande e&s;t, dit-on, la diff&eacute;rence</L>
<L>"Entre le mariage &amp; l'amour," &amp;c.</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e proceedings were really impertinent; to &s;ub&s;titute &s;uch a vulgar and, in&s;ignificant piece for my favourite one, which is &s;o excellent, was not to be borne with. I cannot but be &s;en&s;ibly affronted at them; in&s;omuch that if M. Dolerval &s;hould at|tempt to &s;ing it now, I would oppo&s;e it with &s;pirit. By this you can &s;ee, that none of his unpolite proceedings e&s;cape my notice; that I remark all his faults, and pardon none of his failings. But do you &s;uppo&s;e any per&s;on could be &s;o greatly affront|ed with one they love, and even for &s;uch trifles? Certainly not, and to convince you of it, I can
<PB N="61" REF="035743_0174_1006AFFDA4364380">
&s;incerely declare that I am not in the lea&s;t offend|ed with my uncle.</P>
<P>From this, my &s;i&s;ter, is it not clear, that your anxiety mi&s;led us? I cannot, nor do I wi&s;h to deny that I have &s;ome friend&s;hip for him; but as for lov|ing him, I am certain that I do not. We were, indeed, like a couple of children. Can it &s;eem even probable, that I was &s;o &s;uddenly infatuated? I hear a noi&s;e&mdash;in the par&s;onage! What, is my uncle not a&s;leep? But, methinks, I hear&mdash;his voice. Why &s;hould he return at the hour which he&mdash;? Yes, 'tis his voice&mdash;Wait awhile, my &s;i&s;ter, till I go and li&s;ten.</P>
<P>Yes, Celina, it is M. Dolerval. He &s;aid, "well, very well, I always go to the church."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall not have to wait for me there," an&s;wered my uncle. But what is the meaning of all this? What are they going to do at church? I cannot tell, my &s;i&s;ter, but I have a fore&s;ight of it that alarms me. What can I make of this &s;trange combination of circum&s;tances; tho&s;e my&s;terious conver&s;ations, and the apparent &s;atisfaction of M. Dolerval? And can I be at a lo&s;s when I recollect the &s;ong of this evening? How can it be po&s;&s;ible! Wait, my &s;i&s;ter, I will endeavour to go down without any noi&s;e&mdash;to li&s;ten. I wi&s;h to know&mdash; Heavens! how I tremble! I will return to my dear Celina in a moment.</P>
<P>O, what have I &s;een? What have I heard? Per|fidious man! O, wretched me! Ah, Celina, my hand trembles &s;o that I cannot write&mdash;at pre&s;ent. To-morrow I will tell you all.</P>

<P>BE comforted, my brother, I am not offended with you. The idle apo&s;trophes with which you di&s;honor my ju&s;t &s;entiments do no offend, though their greatly di&s;tre&s;s me. However &s;hort the time of my concern for you may be, I mu&s;t pronounce you incurable. And how di&s;tre&s;&s;ing it would be, if, at la&s;t, I &s;hould be obliged to &s;ign
<PB N="63" REF="035743_0176_1006904C61BACBD0">
an adverti&s;ement of friends, to confine you in the Petites Mai&s;ons!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the name given to the Bedlam in Paris.</NOTE></P>
<P>How? Dolerval is more anxious of knowing whether he is worthy of his mi&s;tre&s;s than any thing el&s;e! He wi&s;hes to feel an eternal flame in perpe|tual privation! O what a misfortune! Where the deuce did you get all this? It mu&s;t be that you know Amadis and A&s;tree by heart, and took it from that. That is the mi&s;chief of it! They ought never to put romances into the hands of &s;uch chil|dren as you; for, &s;ooner or later, the reading of them will turn your brain. Thus it once fared with me. Being but a &s;mall boy, a devout pre|ceptor had made me, for &s;ome time, at morning and evening, meditate upon the life of the &s;aints, and it had &s;uch an effect upon me, that I ran out into the fields with an intention of becoming a hermit.</P>
<P>To continue; the humble per&s;on is of an infe|rior cla&s;s. Have I not gue&s;&s;ed right? Let it be &s;o. Do not fear I &s;hall reprimand you; I know it has always been the cu&s;tom. At Paris you will find the dowager coquettes, who lie in wait to procure the con&s;olation of a young man fre&s;h from the col|lege. And as &s;oon as the novice appears, they fall upon him, and willing or unwilling, introduce him into the world. As for our provincial beauties of forty or fifty, they do not all of them have that happy in&s;tinct. They generally be&s;tow on their chamber-maids the profits and privileges of &s;uch educations. You ought, therefore, in your fir&s;t attempt, like adole&s;cent Tourangeau, to try none but a &s;ubaltern. And you did very wrong, indeed, to accu&s;e us, <HI>men of the world,</HI> of di&s;daining the little creatures. We never di&s;dain them, provided
<PB N="64" REF="035743_0177_1006AFFF9FB09838">
they are &s;weet and hand&s;ome. Come then, don't be offended, I am willing to believe yours to be tolerably genteel. But where could you pick up this Phoenix of poor girls? Among&s;t the attendants of your &s;i&s;ter? No, it cannot be; your female in&s;tructor is very cautious about having any around her but &s;uch as are ugly and old. It may be then a chamber-maid of the &s;ub-delegate's wife, or one belonging to the lady of our grand coun&s;el|lor of election; or rather, the one belonging to the large wife of the pre&s;ident of the &s;alt granary: for the city of Tours &s;warms with women of every rank. You &s;eemed to think your behaviour to|wards the women was becoming. I will not ac|knowledge to you in that point. You &s;eem to be quite de&s;titute of humanity; what will become of them when you &s;lander them at &s;uch a rate? No|body will any longer take notice of them; and yet they may &s;ometimes be as real objects of cha|rity, as the young and hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>It would &s;uit me better, if this dear creature be|longed to my &s;i&s;ter. You might then admire her with more convenience, and it would be ea&s;y for you to watch her more narrowly. For you mu&s;t watch her, Dolerval, whatever you may think of it! Do every thing in your power to prevent the entrance of any &s;parki&s;h fellow. Shut the door again&s;t tho&s;e blades like the Engli&s;h Jockies, &s;hin|ing with youth and beauty. Since they re&s;emble Cupid as well as your&s;elf, you have rea&s;on to be mightily afraid they will agree with you in making no account of birth and education: nor would I advi&s;e you to be le&s;s jealous of tho&s;e large gentle|men, well built and alert, who, with one leap, can &s;cale the highe&s;t walls: &s;uch would be able to rival you in natural advantages. Keep an equal

di&s;tru&s;t of tho&s;e large gentlemen of the hotel, with plump round faces, continually fattened with chick|ens which they do not give gratis to their ma&s;ters. However little &s;ervice your mi&s;tre&s;s might have, Dolerval, a fellow man-&s;ervant, &s;o highly fed as the one I have here given you a &s;ketch of, would, with her, have great means of &s;eduction. What enemies! what great and powerful enemies! Me|thinks I behold them in your ab&s;ence &s;urround this queen of the world, as &s;he comes from turning her lady's buckle. They flatter this idol of your heart, and make her &s;ome pretty propo&s;als of the anti|chamber. They idolize her, flatter and pur&s;ue her, with their wor&s;hip, from the office even to the hou&s;e-top. Take care of your&s;elf, my brother, for in the rank you have &s;o philo&s;ophically cho&s;en the object of your tenderne&s;s, we cannot tell what rival you have mo&s;t rea&s;on to fear: whether a Valmont of the kitchen, or a Lovelace of the &s;table.</P>
<P>Above all things, do not go and verbally &s;tun the ears of your mi&s;tre&s;s with &s;uch a fine &s;ermon as the one you &s;ent me in manu&s;cript. Did you &s;how that compo&s;ition of non&s;en&s;e, love and mo|rality, to our &s;i&s;ter? How mu&s;t &s;he, who is &s;o proud of her innocence and your nullity, be charm|ed with it! But, patience! I cannot but hope you are going to e&s;cape her. Only be ready to get out of your leading &s;trings, and you &s;hall have a new preceptor, who &s;hall give you le&s;&s;ons &s;omewhat dif|ferent. You &s;hall &s;ee what length of time your queen will be contented with your re&s;pectful exta|cies; whether &s;he will always be plea&s;ed with be|ing an idol; whether &s;he will always accommo|date her&s;elf with a lover who is willing to adore her, but has no de&s;ire of obtaining her.

<P>YOU will remember that I recogni&s;ed the voice which I never heard without alarm. At the &s;ame in&s;tant, urged by an anxious de&s;ire of &s;atisfying tho&s;e &s;ad &s;u&s;picions which I feared to &s;ee confirmed, I left the letter which I had begun for you, and went &s;oftly out of my chamber, and with|out light. I &s;oon came to that part of the &s;tair|ca&s;e from whence they proceed to go into the church, and &s;tood upon the landing place. It was not the door of communication where I &s;tood, for M. Sevin, in his precipitation, had neglected to &s;hut it. But he was then &s;carcely in the church, and I believe he was upon the la&s;t &s;tep at the church door; I, therefore, &s;tayed where I was, attentive and trembling. An ungrateful man endeavoured to let his voice be heard: "Come," &s;aid M. Do|lerval, "unite two lovers." And how could I, at that time, avoid having my curio&s;ity mo&s;t feelingly excited? The door which hid every object from

me, yielded to the fir&s;t motion I made to open it; and, through a narrow &s;pace which permitted me to perceive, and apparently without being perceived, I ca&s;t my eager looks into the enclo&s;ure of the tem|ple. There my eyes too plainly beheld the perfi|dious young man who &s;o earne&s;tly urged my uncle to the chapel, which was ornamented for the de|&s;ign, where they waited for nothing but the mi|ni&s;ter. The flambeaus of Hymen were lighted, and I &s;aw a woman at the foot of the altar. Cruel woman! In the mean time I could not refrain from giving her a minute attention. And, &s;hall I tell you, my &s;i&s;ter; &s;hall I tell you this new dream of a di&s;ordered imagination? Yes, Celina, you &s;hall know all my weakne&s;s! Learn, then, another won|derful effect of that &s;entiment which holds domi|nion over me&mdash;of that allurement which, blinding me with perpetual illu&s;ions, fixes in my mind, wherever I am, the image of a man, whom it is de&s;irable for my repo&s;e I might never have &s;een. This woman, in her happy impatience, turned her eyes towards her lover, who continued to ha&s;ten the mini&s;ter, who &s;eemed too &s;low for his wi&s;hes. Then it was, that a violent de&s;ire aro&s;e in my mind of learning the numerous advantages of her who was preferred to me. And I was led to believe, notwith&s;tanding the con&s;iderable di&s;tance between us, that it was po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the features of this &s;tranger, which mu&s;t be &s;o captivating. And could you have believed it, Celina? Yes, I did in fact di&s;tingui&s;h them! Lo! to my extreme confu&s;ion, I di&s;covered, in the features of this wo|man, tho&s;e of her lover! Yes, the more I fixed my afflicted eyes upon her, the more I was per|&s;uaded that in her I beheld the lively re&s;emblance
<PB N="68" REF="035743_0181_1006B01237906168">
of the unkind man, whom her beauty had &s;tolen from me. I cannot tell why this &s;eeming re&s;em|blance augmented my di&s;tre&s;s. But true it was, that my &s;orrow increa&s;ed with the idea of tho&s;e charms po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by my fortunate rival; true it was, that I &s;hould have felt le&s;s afflicted if I could have &s;uppo&s;ed her to be le&s;s beautiful.</P>
<P>At this time I &s;tood &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, and attacked with gloomy reflections: M. Doler|val &s;poke again, and &s;eemingly to give me a fatal &s;troke, &s;aid, "Why do you delay? Come, com|plete her happine&s;s and mine." "I only a&s;k for a moment," an&s;wered my uncle: "you are ready to find fault with me; but when we are &s;o ha&s;ty, &s;omething may be forgotten."</P>
<P>Saying this, he turned about to come back; &s;o that I was obliged to fly to my apartment for fear of being di&s;covered. But the more I hurried on the &s;tairs in my embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation, the more I in|crea&s;ed the difficulties of my &s;peedy retreat. I was really on the &s;econd &s;tory, out of M. Sevin's view, when he came to the landing place I had ju&s;t left. But I &s;tood perfectly &s;till at the door of my chamber, not daring to go in, le&s;t, by making the lea&s;t noi&s;e, I &s;hould be betrayed.</P>
<P>"Vain precaution!" &s;aid my uncle; "no, no; I was not deceived," (&s;peaking in a manner as if he did not wi&s;h to be heard in the church), "&s;ome|body was there to di&s;turb and e&s;py us. Juliette, Juliette! What is the matter with you, that you are awake at this time of night? Go to &s;leep, my girl; go to &s;leep; and be careful never to mention what you have &s;een to-night. This marriage mu&s;t remain a &s;ecret."</P>
<P>After &s;aying this, he returned to the church&punc;
<PB N="69" REF="035743_0182_1006B01B63334E88">
pulled the door after him, which, at this time, he endeavoured to have fa&s;t &s;hut, and left me in un|&s;peakable confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is my duty, however, to confe&s;s that the vex|ation I feel on account of being di&s;covered, is the lea&s;t of all my afflictions. Given up to the mo&s;t painful reflections, I examine, with more faithful|ne&s;s, the deep wounds of my heart. There do I find that cruelly delu&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion in its full extent, which at pre&s;ent I could &s;carcely de&s;ire to di&s;own, and, alas! too late deplore its fatal influence.</P>
<P>Although I cannot deny, Celina, that this cruel pa&s;&s;ion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my heart, you may be a&s;&s;ured that its exi&s;tence is at an end. Nor would I have you fear that it will ever revive. What! could I &s;till love a perfidious man who transfers his affec|tions to another object? A &s;educer, who came to deceive me by the external appearance of an at|tachment, which &s;eemed to be as animated as re|&s;pectful? A traitor, who, in the gloom of night, goes to the foot of the altar, and takes upon him the irrevocable engagement of loving none but my rival? My rival! Ah, no! &s;he is already the wife of M. Dolerval! Can the hu&s;band of another wo|man be any thing to me?&mdash;the hu&s;band of ano|ther!&mdash;O my &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;Can it be po&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>It ought, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to calm my &s;orrows, to con&s;ider how much my uncle &s;eems intere&s;ted in con&s;oling me. Excellent man! this morning he took every po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure to prevent me from recollecting the error of la&s;t night. But at dinner, in &s;pite or every &s;truggle to di&s;gui&s;e my heavine&s;s of mind, it appeared again to &s;uch a degree, that he could not but remark it.</P>
<P>"What is the matter with you, Juliette?" &s;aid he, "you di&s;tre&s;s me. As for my own misfor|tunes,
<PB N="70" REF="035743_0183_1006B0215778B678">
I &s;hall always endeavour to bear them with|out complaining; but as for yours. I know they will be more than I can endure. Can the unhap|py &s;tate you are in be attributed to me? If &s;o, I have unde&s;ignedly become very guilty. Whatever I can do to promote your welfare &s;hall be done, and certainly you are not &s;en&s;ible how much it has co&s;t me."&mdash;</P>
<P>Here I interrupted M. Sevin, for this was more than I could bear: "Di&s;pen&s;e, I pray you, with the trouble of making me remember your kindne&s;s, for I am &s;en&s;ible of it in its full extent: I know that many others who might have &s;pent much more of their money for me, would not have brought me under &s;o great an obligation as you have."</P>
<P>"Why do you &s;peak of money?" cried he. "Has that any reference to my meaning?" Seem|ing to be &s;en&s;ible he ought to proceed no farther, he moderated his voice, and &s;aid, "Well, if it contributes to your peace of mind, believe &s;o. And &s;ince, in an unguarded moment, I was wanting in politene&s;s, be kind enough to pardon me."</P>
<P>A little afterwards, whil&s;t thinking on the events of la&s;t evening, I could not but weep. M. Sevin ob&s;erving me, could not refrain from doing &s;o him|&s;elf. "In the name of friend&s;hip, my dear girl, what is it that &s;o troubles you?"</P>
<P>"Did you not," an&s;wered I, "unite to lovers la&s;t evening?"</P>
<P>"Yes, my niece, and I a&s;&s;ure you it was not a plea&s;ant office."</P>
<P>"O, it is all over then, he is married indeed!"</P>
<P>"What then; what if he was married?"</P>
<P>"If he was," cried I in de&s;pair, (covering my face with my hands) "it would be better for me never to &s;ee him again!" My uncle kept &s;ilence&punc;
<PB N="71" REF="035743_0184_1006B0244954AC00">
but I urged him to explain him&s;elf with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as if I needed to be better certified of my misfortune. The good Curate did not &s;oon yield to my intreaties. As he walked about the room, I ob&s;erved him to be in great agitation of mind. My good friend, for he well de&s;erves that title, my generous friend and benefactor &s;eemed to &s;truggle in his mind with great irre&s;olution. He doubtle&s;s feared the con&s;equence of confirming me in the belief of what I &s;o &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected. At length, for a complete an&s;wer to my inquiries, he &s;aid, with a deep &s;igh, and an inflexion of voice, which was completely convincing, "Poor girl! poor girl!"</P>
<P>Then I con&s;idered that the time drew near when M. Dolerval was accu&s;tomed to vi&s;it us. Not|with&s;tanding his audacious perfidy, I expected he would pre&s;ume to vi&s;it us again. The pity which M. Sevin apparently felt for me, greatly renewed my courage.</P>
<P>"My uncle," &s;aid I, "permit me to retire to my chamber, and &s;tay there during the whole evening."</P>
<P>"What, my niece, mu&s;t I be &s;o long deprived&mdash;?"</P>
<P>"Do not, I pray you, deny me that favour."</P>
<P>"That favour!" repeated he. "Why, I have told you before, and now tell you again, that your de&s;ires, whatever they may co&s;t me, &s;hall always be laws. Go then, my girl, and do not forget, that in my hou&s;e you are ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of your time and actions."</P>
<P>After having thanked him, and being ready to retire, he bid me adieu, in a tone of tender com|pa&s;&s;ion which greatly affected me. I cannot but think, Celina, that my uncle al&s;o is tormented with &s;ome &s;ecret affliction; for I cannot believe that any
<PB N="72" REF="035743_0185_1006B025F03965E0">
except the unfortunate, can &s;o well &s;ympathize with &s;uch as them&s;elves. However, as I was de|&s;irous of being alone, I ran to my apartment, and &s;hut my&s;elf in. Here I am weeping and writing to my &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>WITH what gaiety, my brother, do you vindicate your errors! and you can do it with impunity. For tho&s;e plea&s;antries of yours, which have a reference to me alone, you may be a&s;&s;ured, will leave on my mind no la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ion of re&s;entment. But as to the indecent &s;ar|ca&s;ms with which you reproach a young woman &s;o virtuous and engaging, I con&s;ider them as a &s;pecies of impiety. Neverthele&s;s, I feel, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;po&s;ed to pardon you; becau&s;e I am certain that if you were better acquainted with the adorable niece of M. Sevin, you would no longer indulge your&s;elf in thus reproaching her. What uncommon &s;en&s;e and judgment does &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s! What unu&s;ual qualities are united in her per&s;on! What a train of rare accompli&s;hments! But I mu&s;t leave you, to go and inquire whether &s;he is well. Ye&s;terday I had not the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her. She was indi&s;po&s;ed. Her uncle told me it was but a &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition. But the anxiety I felt la&s;t night, deprived me of &s;leep. I &s;hall feel re&s;tle&s;s till

I have &s;een her again. I am now going thither in ha&s;te.</P>
<P>Noon.</P>
<P>O my brother, what a &s;evere rever&s;e of fortune! What have I done? By what crime towards her have I rendered my&s;elf &s;o guilty? I went to M. Sevin's, and at a time when &s;he did not expect me. Yet &s;he did not di&s;cover that agreeable &s;urpri&s;e which &s;he has &s;o often and &s;o frankly manife&s;ted, when in my evening vi&s;its, I have frequently ar|rived there before the accu&s;tomed hour. Anxious of knowing how &s;he did, I acco&s;ted her, and with earne&s;tne&s;s inquired whether &s;he had recovered?</P>
<P>"Recovered of what, Mon&s;ieur?" &s;aid &s;he in|terrupting me.</P>
<P>"But I was &s;peaking of your indi&s;po&s;ition ye&s;|terday."</P>
<P>"You was mi&s;informed, Mon&s;ieur; you may depend upon it I was quite well."</P>
<P>"But what deprived us of the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you?"</P>
<P>"The plea&s;ure of &s;eeing me, Mon&s;ieur, cannot be very great. Be&s;ides, I do not know that my uncle expected any body ye&s;terday. For my part, I expected nobody, I a&s;&s;ure you."</P>
<P>"What you tell me, Mademoi&s;elle, is calculat|ed both to afflict and a&s;toni&s;h me."</P>
<P>"To a&s;toni&s;h you, Mon&s;ieur! Was it po&s;&s;ible for you to &s;uppo&s;e that your a&s;&s;iduities at this place were more plea&s;ing to one than another?"</P>
<P>"Ah, what do I hear! I may very naturally con&s;ider that remark as a dreadful le&s;&s;on for me, and one that I have not merited."</P>
<P>"Merited or not merited, Mon&s;ieur, you mu&s;t learn to improve by it."</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Augu&s;t 9, 1782,
8 o'clock morning.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you, my deare&s;t Celina, for the con&s;o|lations of your letter; but I do not at pre&s;ent &s;tand in need of them. I am much better&mdash;Learn then&mdash;M. Dolerval&mdash;I was deceived!&mdash;Attend, my &s;i&s;ter. Ye&s;terday I did my&s;elf &s;o much vio|lence as to tell him I wi&s;hed never to &s;ee him again; but &s;o great an effort exhau&s;ted all my &s;trength and re&s;olution: &s;o that I &s;pent the re&s;t of the day, and all the &s;ucceeding night, in tears. In the evening my uncle &s;eemed to be much afflicted to &s;ee me &s;o &s;orrowful, and much more &s;o the morning after. "Poor creature!" &s;aid he, un|cea&s;ingly, and at length fell into one of his pro|found reveries. He walked about in a ha&s;ty man|ner, with irre&s;olution in his countenance, and
<PB N="75" REF="035743_0188_1006B038A64516B0">
&s;eemed to be much di&s;&s;atisfied with him&s;elf. And I thought I heard him, though indi&s;tinctly, &s;ay as follows: "My error has la&s;ted too long already. This was a great cruelty! and to continue in it, would be a &s;till greater perfidy!"</P>
<P>Then he in&s;tantly turned round, came to me precipitately, and with much force of expre&s;&s;ion he &s;aid, "Your &s;orrow is too cruel, it wounds me to the &s;oul. Comfort your&s;elf, my girl; wipe off your tears: he is not married."</P>
<P>Who? He? My uncle&mdash;Him&s;elf&mdash;Do you &s;ay that he is not?&mdash;repeat it, I pray you, repeat it. "I &s;ay he is not married, Juliette. You did not un|der&s;tand my an&s;wer, ye&s;terday. My an&s;wer, it is true, was equivocal, and I was to blame. My error was great indeed; but what can you expect from me, my niece? I am but a man, and as liable as any other to be &s;ubjected to the reign&mdash;Par|don me, and I be&s;eech you take pity&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here my uncle inturrupted him&s;elf, and &s;eemingly becau&s;e he &s;aw me turn pale, and ready to fall. At fir&s;t I aro&s;e &s;uddenly, and in my &s;peech and ac|tions di&s;covered &s;ome violence; but as I was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of great weakne&s;s, I was again forced to take my &s;eat.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be, however, that M. Sevin &s;uppo&s;ed there was nothing alarming in my &s;ituation at that time, for in&s;tead of offering me any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he left me precipitately; and, in fact, my weakne&s;s was not very grievous, and &s;oon left me.</P>
<P>Here I waited awhile for my uncle, who did not return; and fearing he was offended, I went down into the garden to look for him. He was almo&s;t concealed in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure part of the garden. There I &s;aw him &s;tanding up, reclining his
<PB N="76" REF="035743_0189_1006B041E2528B78">
head upon his hands again&s;t a tree. His po&s;ture &s;eemed to be that of a man deeply thoughtful; and he mu&s;t have been extremely &s;o; for without his either hearing or perceiving me, I came and &s;tood very near him.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid he, "it was joy in the extreme."</P>
<P>"No, my uncle, it was the extreme of a&s;toni&s;h|ment."</P>
<P>On hearing my voice he &s;tarted in great &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Why do you not re&s;pect my &s;olitude," &s;aid he. "Why do you follow me here to &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;?"</P>
<P>I could not wait until he had fini&s;hed, for I &s;aw him in tears.</P>
<P>"But I &s;hould be unhappy, my uncle, if my joy proves a cau&s;e of &s;orrow to you!"</P>
<P>"No, no," an&s;wered he; (taking hold of my hand) "no, my girl: but, on the contrary, I &s;hall be happy no longer than whil&s;t you are &s;o. As for my tears&mdash;do not regard them. And how can you determine the cau&s;e? Perhaps the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing your grief at an end&mdash;and the hap|pine&s;s of comforting my young friend, who mu&s;t be greatly afflicted."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Greatly afflicted, do you believe?"</P>
<P>"Come," continued he, "I mu&s;t completely atone for my errors."</P>
<P>"And for mine al&s;o, my uncle."</P>
<P>"I will go to find him."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Will you go in a &s;hort time?"</P>
<P>"This morning."</P>
<P>"Pre&s;ently?"</P>
<P>"Yes, I will go immediately, and tell him, on my part and yours."</P>
<P>"Wherefore on my part? Can you not have goodne&s;s enough to inform him that your niece is,
<PB N="77" REF="035743_0190_1006B0474AD85630">
at times, &s;omewhat ill tempered; but that you would not, on account of her caprice, &s;acrifice a friend&s;hip?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you," interrupted he; "it be|longs to me to make reconciliation with Dolerval, not to Juliette. Do not, my girl, ever mention a word to him of what you &s;aw on the night of day before ye&s;terday. I mu&s;t not, and cannot unveil the my&s;tery of this clande&s;tine marriage. Let it &s;uffice you to know, that Dolerval was pre&s;ent at that time only as a witne&s;s. Believe me, when I now renew the a&s;&s;urances of its being true."</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation, the details of which I have almo&s;t minutely given you, has relieved my mind from a grievous oppre&s;&s;ion. It is incumbent upon me, at pre&s;ent, to go down, for my uncle is going away. I will not bid you adieu, my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Noon.</P>
<P>I have &s;een him again, Celina, &s;ooner than I could have de&s;ired, and at a moment when I lea&s;t expected him. My uncle, it &s;eemed to me, had been gone a long time, and I greatly wi&s;hed for his return. Several times in my impatience, did I go from the yard into the garden, and back again into the yard, accu&s;ing M. Sevin of being extremely &s;low. After I had &s;pent &s;ome time in this manner, not knowing any better method of &s;hortening the time, I went into the hou&s;e, and &s;at down at the piano. There were &s;everal pieces of mu&s;ic lying on the de&s;k, and I endeavoured to play them: but as they were more lengthy than I wi&s;hed, I quitted them, and returned very naturally to my favourite &s;ong, which I &s;ung and accompanied my voice with the mu&s;ic. After I had fini&s;hed it, "What a voice! what talents!" cried &s;omebody.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="035743_0191_1006B04D9FBA8F00">Looking around, I &s;aw, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, that he &s;tood li&s;tening at the door of the apartment, where, believing my&s;elf alone, I had given my voice its full &s;cope. M. Sevin had made u&s;e of his key<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pa&s;&s;e-par-tout, a key that unlocks many doors.</NOTE> without my hearing him. He brought M. Dolerval with him, who &s;tood li&s;tening at the &s;ame time, &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e, and, perhaps, I may &s;ay, with admiration. It &s;eems &s;trange, that, at this juncture, and con&s;idering the &s;tate of my mind, that I &s;hould have conducted &s;o imprudently. No longer knowing where I was, or what I did, I ro&s;e up, went towards him, and ob&s;erved that his countenance was changed. M. Sevin perceiving my over-&s;ight, attempted to atone for it; but being too ha&s;ty, he &s;ucceeded no better than my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Changed," cried he, "we are all changed, and let us ca&s;t off our re&s;entment; let us &s;peak of the brilliant wit of the di&s;crete Juliette."</P>
<P>Here compliments were renewed. M. Sevin di&s;covered much &s;urpri&s;e, and reproached me, though in a gentle and courteous manner. But M. Dolerval was more &s;urpri&s;ed than he, and it &s;eemed difficult for him to believe that the uncle was unacquainted with the talents of the niece. Both of them, however, urged me to begin again, and with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as if they feared what they had &s;een to be only a dream. In this attempt I did not &s;ucceed &s;o well as the former: perhaps by rea&s;on of my efforts to exceed it: be it as it may, there was a trembling in my hands and voice. My uncle remarked it with &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, and I can excu&s;e him for it. But methinks M. Doler|val ought to be better &s;atisfied. However, they mutually congratulated each other on the acqui&s;ition
<PB N="79" REF="035743_0192_1006B053C55A2DA0">
of a new a&s;&s;i&s;tant in mu&s;ic, by which means the happy moment would &s;oon arrive when we &s;hould have frequent concerts. They even propo&s;ed making a party after dinner. M. Dolerval pro|mi&s;ed to bring his ma&s;ter: and as to his &s;i&s;ter, he &s;aid, in a few days he hoped it would be in her power to attend al&s;o: and then, without doubt, &s;he would come, and without delay, to admire the talents, and, perhaps, participate in the &s;ucce&s;s of a rival, well worthy of her attention.</P>
<P>I do not wi&s;h, my &s;i&s;ter, to di&s;&s;emble in any thing. The appearance of M. Dolerval, this morn|ing, was not according to my wi&s;hes. In his be|haviour, he &s;eemed to &s;how more indifference than re&s;erve; and, in his air, more coldne&s;s than de|jection. He &s;eemed le&s;s plea&s;ed on di&s;covering &s;uch a de&s;irable talent in me, than vexed with the idea of our having &s;o long concealed it from him. And as he went away, I was convinced, by &s;ome ex|pre&s;&s;ions he made in his parting compliments, that he &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed my uncle combined with me in a de&s;ign of deceiving him. What exce&s;&s;ive inju&s;tice! I can hardly forgive him! We &s;hall &s;ee this even|ing, whether he will then pre&s;ume to entertain &s;u&s;|picions which &s;o much afflict me. Of this, I &s;hall not fail to inform you, my &s;i&s;ter. But of what con&s;equence is it to you? And why &s;hould I be &s;o &s;tupid as to indulge my thoughts, and employ my|&s;elf in this manner? Ah! my dear Celina, once more vouch&s;afe to pardon Emilia. Perhaps you will be better plea&s;ed with the fir&s;t letter &s;he &s;hall &s;end you hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXV. Emilia in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Augu&s;t 11, 1782.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT a &s;tupid creature I am! In my an|&s;wer of day before ye&s;terday, I pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence that article of your letter, which, more than any other, required explanation. I am of the &s;ame opinion as your&s;elf. M. Sevin, I make no doubt, has conceived a fatal pa&s;&s;ion for your unfortunate &s;i&s;ter. It &s;eems al&s;o beyond a doubt, that jealou&s;y, the mo&s;t wretched of pa&s;&s;ions, has entered the heart of this man, which was equally in&s;pired with benevolence and &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday we had a concert for the &s;econd time. And I mu&s;t declare, that if it were po&s;&s;ible for any thing to give me a di&s;ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, it would have been the manner in which we performed our con|cert. As &s;oon as M. Dolerval appeared, my uncle ran to him, and, to do him ju&s;tice, gave him a favourable reception. But why does he not &s;uf|fer me to treat the young man even with ordinary civility? Why does he &s;carcely give me time to addre&s;s M. Dolerval with &s;ome of tho&s;e que&s;tions of politene&s;s which cu&s;tom authori&s;es, even among&s;t ordinary acquaintances? May we not, in fact, &s;ay, that every kind of conver&s;ation fatigues him when we have the company of a third per&s;on who can render it more agreeable? M. Sevin urges and tor|ments us. We are forced, in order to plea&s;e him, to enter into the tedious quatuors. If the pieces are of that &s;ort which he calls lively, and which I
<PB N="81" REF="035743_0194_1006B0623A2F6E78">
&s;hould call very tedious, the Curate performs his part not &s;o ill. But it is far otherwi&s;e when we chance to light upon any of tho&s;e pieces which are really intere&s;ting; full of &s;oft, tender and affection|ate expre&s;&s;ions. Then I enter perfectly into the &s;pirit and mea&s;ure of the piece, play it with more warmth, ta&s;te and preci&s;ion! M. Dolerval, on his part, is animated and impa&s;&s;ioned: for he is full of &s;pirit and animation. But my uncle at once &s;poils the whole. And how can he follow the mea&s;ure of the mu&s;ic, when his eyes are con&s;tantly fixed on his niece and his friend? In vain do we endeavour to continue; in vain does the attentive ma&s;ter call back the wanderer; M. Sevin will not under&s;tand any thing. The la&s;t evening, his mind was &s;o greatly di&s;turbed, that he ha&s;tily threw down his in&s;trument at the ri&s;k of breaking it, ran into ano|ther apartment, and &s;hut the door after him. He returned, indeed, but it was then too late: for no|body could prevail with him to take up the piece again which had been &s;o cruelly interrupted. At &s;uch a time I could not but complain. Notwith|&s;tanding the &s;miles he affected, he &s;eemed to be much confu&s;ed and vexed at his mi&s;conduct. In this place, I will remark one circum&s;tance which much afflicted me: both times, when he retired to his room, his eyes, on his return, were red and heavy. When he fled to his apartment, I make no doubt but he went there to weep alone.</P>
<P>It &s;eems equally &s;trange, and I declare it with &s;till greater di&s;plea&s;ure, that M. Dolerval no longer &s;eems to have that tender intere&s;t he formerly had in the feelings of his friend, and which the unfor|tunate &s;ituation of M. Sevin &s;eems always to re|quire. M. Dolerval, except in tho&s;e rare and fleeting moments when mu&s;ic warms and enlivens

him, and when (if I may be allowed the expre&s;|&s;ion) it carries him away from him&s;elf, &s;till pre|&s;umes to continue the &s;ame indifferent and almo&s;t di&s;dainful behaviour towards me, which the other day &s;o much offended me. Why &s;hould the un|happine&s;s of my uncle &s;o &s;oon weary the patience of his friend? And, though I might have done wrong in &s;ome in&s;tances, why &s;hould he yet feel indi&s;po&s;ed to overlook any thing? Shall I tell you my opinion, Celina? Such a &s;udden change in his conduct has given me a variety of thoughts. That M. Sevin has become jealous and in love, every thing combines to prove; nor do I wi&s;h to doubt it any longer: but his own unhappine&s;s, I believe, is not his only affliction. Is he not al&s;o afflicted as &s;everely with &s;ome great anxiety on account of Juliette? Was it occa&s;ioned by a pity ill under|&s;tood by me, on the day after that fatal night when I was &s;o greatly oppre&s;&s;ed with the weight of my &s;orrows, that my too generous uncle conceived it his duty to tell me a fal&s;ehood, cruelly officious, the fault of which he at pre&s;ent conceives to be dangerous for me? What can I think? Is the &s;o much altered Dolerval married, or is he not? You will &s;ee that my &s;u&s;picions are horrible. But re|move from my &s;ight, Celina, if po&s;&s;ible, all tho&s;e objects of my jealou&s;y which are every moment re|vived in my imagination. O, that temple! that altar! that woman who is ever in my memory&punc; and whom I &s;hould know amid&s;t a thou&s;and others! Let me never &s;ee any more, the place which every day, and often &s;everal times in a day, I &s;ee, where the mo&s;t deceitful of men ha&s;tened the &s;teps of the mini&s;ter! Above all things, let me never hear again tho&s;e words of a &s;en&s;e &s;o clear and terrible: "Why do you delay? Come, complete her hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="83" REF="035743_0196_1006B06BA7394E38">
and mine." Does a mere witne&s;s of a mar|riage go to the altar with &s;o much eagerne&s;s? Would one who was only a witne&s;s, ha&s;ten the prie&s;t with &s;uch urgent language? O what have I written! With what &s;trange thoughts does my plea&s;ing delu&s;ion inve&s;t me! Unhappy Emilia! Does it appertain to me, to inquire whether he is bound to another by indi&s;&s;oluble ties, or whether I have made any impre&s;&s;ion on his heart? Alas! I ought only to inquire what mea&s;ures are mo&s;t &s;uit|able for &s;hunning the mi&s;eries preparing for me by a dangerous pa&s;&s;ion, and in what manner I ought to re&s;i&s;t it.</P>
<P>But, O Celina! do you think it practicable for me to execute that project which I &s;ometimes thought of in de&s;pair, and which you could not propo&s;e but with trembling? Can I forthwith quit this retirement which protected me in my misfor|tunes; renounce this country life, for who&s;e peace|ful plea&s;ures I have conceived a &s;trong attachment; abandon the worthy M. Sevin, who regarded not the increa&s;e of his indigence by &s;upporting me; and, for the reward of his ho&s;pitality, leave him nothing but the remembrance of my ungrateful di&s;tru&s;t? Would it be advi&s;eable to fly a dear and dangerous enemy to my peace of mind, and run the ri&s;k again of falling by the &s;word of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in? Again commit my de&s;tiny to the chance of unhappy events; go from door to door, begging a &s;helter, and in the terror of a danger almo&s;t imaginary, &s;ince it is known, expo&s;e my&s;elf to a thou&s;and dangers, perhaps inevitable, becau&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee them? No; ah, no! I cannot have courage to li&s;ten to the coun&s;els of a fore|&s;ight that would leave me to my&s;elf &s;o wretched.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVI. Murville to Dolerval.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Bre&s;t,
<DATE>Augu&s;t 10, 1782.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>COME, M. Dolerval, I am forced to give you a great deal of pain! Mu&s;t I be put to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urpri&s;ing you with tho&s;e confe&s;&s;ions which it would be &s;o de&s;irable to obtain from you? Having &s;o nearly gained my point, I owe you enormous thanks. How I rejoice to think you are likely to &s;upport the honor of the family! How then! You a&s;pire to nothing le&s;s than meddling in the fir&s;t place, with the dainty mor&s;els of the church! Sweetly bewitched with your own hands! And at the expence of a dear friend! Is not this a glorious beginning? Now I acknowledge you to be of my own blood&mdash;Lo! this is the race of Murvilles!</P>
<P>But you have been &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ta&s;te like a mere countryman, that I dare not flatter my&s;elf with being &s;oon &s;ucce&s;sful in giving you more noble inclinations. And have I not, my dear Dolerval, for once only, unfortunately expected too much from you? Is not this M. Sevin the late Curate of St. Cyr? This young man, whom you value &s;o highly, and who loves you &s;o &s;u|premely, that he is to you a &s;ort of Pylades.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A man remarkable for his faithful friend&s;hip to Ore&s;tes. They were two Greeks of ancient times.</NOTE> A good-hearted fellow be&s;ides, who &s;ighs uncea&s;ingly after the marriage of the prie&s;ts. Ah, the cunning
<PB N="85" REF="035743_0198_1006B0789D2190B8">
blade! I foretold him this, and very truly, that at &s;ome time or other, notwith&s;tanding his &s;cruples, he would end in having a niece!</P>
<P>But I will venture as much as you dare, that you do not know the greatne&s;s of the enterpri&s;e you are going to undertake. I will bet any thing you don't know what it is to be the niece of a Curate. And &s;ince I think you do not, I am de|termined to inform you, and that very minutely. I will not let &s;lip this opportunity of &s;howing you a little erudition, for I am de&s;irous of gaining your e&s;teem.</P>
<P>In former times, my brother, a long while ago, at a time when neither you, nor I, nor Curate Se|vin, were in the world, the primitive church did prie&s;ts the honor of believing them to be men, and rendered them the ju&s;tice of acknowledging them to be &s;o; and, in con&s;equence of this opinion, per|mitted any one of them who de&s;ired it, to choo&s;e a companion, whom he might, with all &s;afety, call his wife; and permitted him, in&s;tead of pocket money, to bequeath to her annually an innocent creature, whom they could not call radically ille|gitimate. To their great misfortune, a council, and it was, if I mi&s;take not, the council of Trent,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He is mi&s;taken indeed: his erudition is as &s;uperficial as that of young men at the time he mentions. The fact is this: No divine precept forbids, nor can forbid, the marriage of the prie&s;ts. No divine law counteracts the &s;acred laws of nature. The Old Te&s;tament leaves to the mini&s;ters of the altar, the ex|erci&s;e of all their faculties: and, in the new, Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays nothing which has a tendency to dimini&s;h the rights of man. St. Paul al&s;o, one of his mo&s;t zealous apo&s;tles, in his epi&s;tles to Titus and Timothy, orders the bi&s;hops to be cha&s;te and continent, not only in celibacy, but even in marriage. Opor|tet epi&s;copum e&s;&s;e unius uxoris verum, &s;ays he. A bi&s;hop mu&s;t be the hu&s;band of one wife. Ob&s;erve what he &s;ays: only one! In the three fir&s;t centuries of the church, the bi&s;hops, who doubtle&s;s under&s;tood St. Paul, married al&s;o. Of this, I am willing to give you &s;everal in&s;tances. According to St. Jerome, whom we ought to believe, becau&s;e a &s;aint would not lie, Tertullian, when ready to give up the gho&s;t, ex|horted his wife to continency. Some readers may &s;uppo&s;e Tertullian to have been too much of an egoti&s;t: this is nothing to the purpo&s;e; all I wi&s;h you to remark is, that this great per&s;onage, jealous of his moiety even beyond the grave, had a moiety. You may al&s;o find he was not the only one. St. Cyprian &s;everely reproves a married prie&s;t by the name of Novatus. Stay a little; he does not &s;cold him for having a wife, for loving her exceedingly, nor for having too much care&s;&s;ed her; but quite the contrary, for having abu&s;ed her ex|tremely, and in very critical circum&s;tances. This Novatus, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, was a brutal man. But I am glad to find a &s;aint, at that day, e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of a prie&s;t's wife, and that of his progeny.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to the dreadful councils. Unfortunate prie&s;ts! it was that of Neo&s;area, held in 314, who fir&s;t at|tempted, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to re&s;train your matrimonial facul|ties. They declared, in their tenth canon, that every deacon who &s;hould not, at the time of his ordination, have acknow|ledged his intentions as to providing him&s;elf with a companion, &s;hould&punc; at any time thereafter, renounce the functions of wor|&s;hip whenever he pretended to tho&s;e of marriage. Eleven years afterwards, the too famous council of Nice ordered ce|libacy to every prie&s;t, without exception. In the following age came the infamous council of Orange, who&s;e anti-natural wi&s;dom depo&s;ed all men in orders who did not ab&s;tain from women. At length the excellent and righteous Pope Gregory VII. completed the work, and withdrew the &s;acred mini&s;ters from &s;ociety and the human race.</P>
<P>Towards the middle of the 12th century, Pope Cele&s;tin was, notwith&s;tanding, obliged to &s;end legates into Bohemia, to &s;ubject the eccle&s;ia&s;tics of that country to celibacy. Being &s;taunch friends to matrimony, the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tics prote&s;ted they could not endure a yoke which neither them&s;elves nor their forefathers had ever been able to bear. They were, however, con&s;trained to it; and I leave you to judge whether the tran|quillity of the laical hu&s;bands has not been injured in con&s;e|quence of this con&s;traint. I am for judging by compari&s;on, and, for in&s;tance, would refer you to the good natured hu&s;bands of this country.</P>
<P>After thirteen hundred years of barbarity, the voice of rea|&s;on again endeavoured to be heard. Charles V. de&s;ired the council of Trent to re&s;tore the right of marrying to all the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics; but Pope Paul III. refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to it. Whe|ther it was this Paul III. I cannot affirm, who being urged to declare the rea&s;ons of his aver&s;ion for the marriage of the prie&s;ts, an&s;wered, the greate&s;t rea&s;ons he had again&s;t it were, that the wives and children of the prie&s;ts brought the riches of the church into danger. Excellent rea&s;on! But two years ago, it would have done tolerably well in this country. But at this day, when the church has no longer any temporal riches to pre&s;erve, why &s;hould they deny to its mini&s;ters the happine&s;s of a lawful union? Humane and prudent legi&s;la|tures! re&s;tore to the prie&s;ts the privilege of marrying our daughters, if you de&s;ire in earne&s;t that they may leave us the exclu&s;ive enjoyment of our wives.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="86" REF="035743_0199_1006B083AEABEBF8">
who, having in their own conceit, more know|ledge than any other, di&s;covered that the prie&s;ts were no part of the human race, and decided that they &s;hould ab&s;tain from mingling their &s;acred blood with the impure blood of a chri&s;tian woman.
<PB N="87" REF="035743_0200_1006B085964DC338">
Thus determined the &s;acred decree of the council; but nature, not being in every in&s;tance catholic, apo&s;tolical and Roman, has never inclined to &s;anc|tion this epi&s;copal canon. Since that time, in order to avenge her&s;elf for this in&s;ult, &s;he has forced many a bi&s;hop publicly to maintain a number of fine girls. And the poor curates, who dared not, like their &s;uperiors, to incur public cen&s;ure, in&s;tead of having a wife, have, &s;ince the time ju&s;t mention|ed, had a niece. About the &s;ame time, I &s;uppo&s;e, in order to provide more conveniently for the mul|titudes of illegitimate children which continually proceeded from the bo&s;om of the church, they in|vented friars, nuns and mona&s;teries.</P>
<P>But you, my poor fellow, are going to interfere with an elect! Don't you know, haple&s;s man,
<PB N="88" REF="035743_0201_1006B08B0442CA30">
that the God of prie&s;ts is a God of vengeance? Beware, beware that the good Curate does not excommunicate you, and in an in&s;tant order &s;ome officious demon to carry you away into the mid&s;t of his companions!</P>
<P>Don't &s;ay I have not warned you, my brother. Neverthele&s;s, if you per&s;i&s;t in your intention, learn of me the readie&s;t means of fini&s;hing that adventure which may, perhaps, bring your condemnation with it. The well beloved of an eccle&s;ia&s;tic mu&s;t have a devout &s;oul: it will, therefore, be nece&s;&s;ary to try the tempting things of Lombard-&s;treet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lombard-&s;treet, in Paris, is famous for the plenty and va|riety of cakes, &s;weetmeats, &amp;c. &s;old there.</NOTE> Tempt her with dry &s;weetmeats, pa&s;tils, dainties, and little cakes. Be careful of adding to the&s;e, from time to time, the &s;ugar-image of a Madona, or ra|ther of &s;ome well conditioned St. Chri&s;topher. As &s;oon as you &s;hall have prepared the way, by the&s;e acts of kindne&s;s, you mu&s;t boldly endeavour to gain a private conference. She will not be back|ward, I'll a&s;&s;ure you. Only be careful to under|&s;tand the different &s;ounds of the church bell. Do you hear that mournful tingling? It is for a poor chri&s;tian, an hour of &s;upreme importance; but for my lucky brother, the hour of a &s;hepherd. This bell calls the dear uncle to the bed of a dying man; run, Dolerval, to the pillow of the niece. The Rev. Curate terrifies the poor dying per&s;on with the words of peace; but you, my brother, mu&s;t &s;trive, by le&s;s awkward addre&s;&s;es, not to affrighten the well and living per&s;on, whom it is de&s;irable, at this urgent moment, &s;hould be converted by you. In &s;hort, while the unlucky prie&s;t u&s;es, perhaps, fruitle&s;s endeavours to &s;ave a man from purgatory,

make ha&s;te, my brother, to &s;end a woman to para|di&s;e. Thus, therefore, ina&s;much as a paternal ex|cur&s;ion of the pa&s;tor will &s;end a poor creature into the other world, an amorous incur&s;ion of my bro|ther will bring another into this. Wonder, in the mean time, at the great effects &s;ometimes produced by the lea&s;t cau&s;es. By means of the&s;e dainty pre|&s;ents, you will repair all the ravages made in the pari&s;h, by the frightful garments of M. Sevin. In &s;pite of his murderous gown, you will hinder the hamlet from being depopulated.

<P>In a few weeks I hope I &s;hall be able to en|courage you with my pre&s;ence. I have determin|ed on taking a journey to Paris, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of watching over my unfaithful friend.

When I con&s;ider how the ru&s;tic moiety of a poor Curate has completely deranged you, I am &s;en&s;ible that for Mademoi&s;elle de Terville you would have &s;aid and done a mul|titude of fooli&s;h things.</P>

<P>IT is done! my fate is determined! never&mdash;never mu&s;t I expect any more to find happine&s;s upon earth. No, it would be in vain, in this tran&s;itory &s;tate, to &s;eek for repo&s;e. In whatever tranquil abode peace choo&s;es her re&s;idence, I need but make my appearance to expel her from thence. The ill fate which con&s;tantly pur&s;ues me, is attached to all per&s;ons who can, in any re&s;pect, be called my connections! Misfortune upon misfortune is en|tailed upon all per&s;ons having a regard for me, who dare, in any manner, to connect their de&s;|tinies with mine! Such a per&s;on &s;oon becomes the object of univer&s;al pity; by which means, my own lot becomes more deplorable.</P>
<P>Before I came hither to di&s;turb M. Sevin's re|treat, it afforded him many enjoyments. But &s;ince my entrance into this once peaceful dwelling, its wretched ma&s;ter has cea&s;ed to be happy. From my a&s;pect, tranquil plea&s;ure has fled, and, perhaps, fled forever. My uncle can no longer attend to tho&s;e dome&s;tic affairs, which formerly to him, were rather a recreation than labour. His garden
<PB N="4" REF="035743_0206_1006B0AA144F10F0">
is no longer cultivated; his favourite birds langui&s;h whil&s;t expecting their u&s;ual nouri&s;hment. He &s;eems to langui&s;h him&s;elf; he con&s;umes&mdash;his youth, wa&s;ted by corroding cares; advances with rapidity to its end. His &s;acred duties, the mo&s;t important offices of his mini&s;try, have become in&s;upportable. Even to the altar have I &s;een him bear his &s;ad re|veries, his profound anxiety, his tears and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>And can you imagine, Celina, that I, the au|thor of &s;o many evils, can remain an indifferent &s;pectator of them? No; my heart, wounded with &s;orrow, is bereft of every con&s;olation.</P>
<P>And, on the other hand, what have become of tho&s;e greate&s;t con&s;olations which I once enjoyed? M. Dolerval, of late, has &s;eemed quite as unhappy as my uncle: like him, he has an air of perpetual inquietude, and appears, at all times, to be pain|fully agitated. His countenance is greatly chang|ed; his pale, di&s;coloured figure, has lo&s;t much of that native &s;weetne&s;s from which it derived its prin|cipal beauty, and has become the re&s;idence of cor|roding care. His eyes al&s;o, red and heavy, rarely di&s;cover their wonted vivacity; his voice is chang|ed and faltering. Sometimes, in extreme confu|&s;ion, he appears de&s;irous of entru&s;ting us with a painful &s;ecret; but a certain &s;trange and unac|countable di&s;tru&s;t obliges him to de&s;i&s;t. His only explanations con&s;i&s;t of &s;ighs, which he in vain endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>And if M. Sevin is not afraid of this confidence, by what &s;trange and incredible fatality does it hap|pen, that he endeavours, by all po&s;&s;ible means, to prevent M. Dolerval from divulging it. I have already told you, I believe, that my uncle &s;carcely gives me time to perform the u&s;ual ceremonies of politene&s;s to his friend. Mu&s;ic is not, at pre&s;ent&punc;
<PB N="5" REF="035743_0207_1006B0AFB124EAD8">
the &s;ubject which oppo&s;es our conver&s;ation: it is a book, which the Curate puts into M. Dolerval's hands as &s;oon as he enters the hou&s;e. And, O what a book! The author endeavours to prove, vile, per&s;onal intere&s;ts to be the only motive of our actions; that, con&s;equently, there are but few virtues on earth. For in&s;tance, no filial tender|ne&s;s; no brotherly affection; no faithful and di&s;|intere&s;ted love; nor even &s;o much as true friend|&s;hip. And what if all this could be inconte&s;tably proved? Would it, even then, be attended with any good con&s;equences to pre&s;ent before mankind this hideous picture of their deformity? For my part, I mu&s;t declare that this dete&s;table compo&s;i|tion tarni&s;hes my &s;oul, confounds and di&s;gu&s;ts me, and leaves me in ab&s;olute de&s;pondency. And the chagrin of my uncle, mu&s;t have wonderfully changed the natural goodne&s;s of his character, or he would not, at this time, be plea&s;ed with &s;uch a book, and per&s;i&s;t in afflicting us with it every day. Do you not believe, Celina, that, were this dread|ful &s;y&s;tem once to be generally embraced, it would make us entirely dete&s;t human nature? No faith|ful nor di&s;intere&s;ted love! Is it not, my &s;i&s;ter, a mo&s;t horrible thought?</P>
<P>Not even true friend&s;hip! If what I &s;ee in this place &s;hould much longer remain, I &s;hall be tempted to believe in that odious principle my&s;elf. One of the two friends often forgets the re&s;pect and bene|volence due to the other: M. Sevin often &s;peaks to the young man with ill-di&s;gui&s;ed impatience, and &s;ometimes with a voice of intolerable &s;everity. What &s;urpri&s;es me &s;till more, M. Dolerval, at times, gets out of humour him&s;elf. The other evening&mdash;no, Celina, it was ye&s;terday&mdash;it &s;eems to be &s;everal years ago&mdash;ye&s;terday evening M.
<PB N="6" REF="035743_0208_1006B0B18744E2B8">
Dolerval &s;eemed to be as much vexed with this book as my&s;elf; and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, ca&s;t it away a little abruptly; but, &s;oon convinced of his un|becoming behaviour, he leaned upon the table, co|vered his face with his hands, and remained &s;everal minutes in this humiliating po&s;ture. His brea&s;t ro&s;e and fell with &s;udden and irregular motions, and, I mu&s;t own, I felt much affected when I ob&s;erved &s;everal tears between his fingers. My uncle, who remained a &s;ilent &s;pectator, then aro&s;e, and, with a pitiful but inoffen&s;ive tone, &s;aid to his friend&mdash; "Con&s;ider, M. Dolerval, whether the &s;trange figure we two make here mu&s;t not be quite un|amu&s;ing to my niece."</P>
<P>"What your mode&s;ty permits you to advance only in a collective manner," an&s;wered the young man, "mu&s;t, I am &s;en&s;ible, have reference to me alone. Ah! if I had &s;o much fortitude as to re|main at home, and hide my weakne&s;s there, you would, doubtle&s;s, be better plea&s;ed. 'Tis out of di&s;pute, that it would be more agreeable to you, if your friend, a &s;ilent witne&s;s of your good fortune, would never come here to empoi&s;on it with any inquietude."</P>
<P>"What exce&s;&s;ive irony!" an&s;wered my uncle with &s;everity. "Were I in your place, Dolerval, and &s;hould believe what you have pre&s;umed to &s;ay, I &s;hould, at lea&s;t, endeavour to have &s;o much gene|ro&s;ity as to exerci&s;e the courage you &s;peak of."</P>
<P>"This," replied M. Dolerval in his turn, much agitated, "is the very advice I have, for a long time, expected; and, depend upon it, I &s;hall, to the extent of my power, endeavour to follow it." He then ro&s;e to go away, but, &s;topping a moment to look at me once more, he uttered &s;ome expre&s;|&s;ions which my uncle con&s;idered as an outrage
<PB N="7" REF="035743_0209_1006B0B5F2FCFE68">
both upon Juliette and him&s;elf; but, to me, they appeared to have nothing in them but a &s;trange ob|&s;curity in their meaning, which made me feel un|ea&s;y, but gave me no offence. "A&s;&s;uredly, M. Sevin," &s;aid he, you cannot but be very happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this young woman at your hou&s;e; but never&mdash;and you wre&s;t the declaration from me &mdash;never could I have thought that you al&s;o would have a niece."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he &s;uddenly left us. We have not &s;een him this evening; and, for twenty-four long hours, he has not been here.</P>
<P>He will, I perceive, pre&s;erve his re&s;entment on account of this la&s;t quarrel; and my uncle, as much to blame as he, ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ts in finding an in&s;ult in tho&s;e words which &s;eemed purely inig|matical, and prote&s;ts he will not go after him again. Alas! de&s;titute even of true friend&s;hip! But how can my uncle be much to blame? What did the young man intend by vi&s;iting at our hou&s;e? How &s;trangely he has behaved here! and, if he is mar|ried, why &s;hould he come to di&s;turb our tran|quillity? and, if he is not, with what can he be &s;o much afflicted? and how can I, on his account, feel &s;o much anxiety? We have not &s;een him during twenty-four long hours!</P>
<P>At la&s;t my eyes are opened&mdash;perhaps too late; but never will I clo&s;e them again. That re&s;olu|tion which &s;eemed &s;o cruel as to appear impracti|cable, is the mo&s;t advi&s;able one I can take. I mu&s;t fly&mdash;I mu&s;t go&mdash;no matter where, provided it be far, very far from this place, where my pre|&s;ence makes every one mi&s;erable. A few more days as tedious and unhappy as the pre&s;ent, will give me a di&s;po&s;ition and courage to undertake it. Indeed, I mu&s;t for&s;ake this a&s;ylum, &s;o in&s;ecure

again&s;t the entrance of pa&s;&s;ions, and very cautious &s;hall I be about fixing upon any other, however &s;ecure it &s;hall appear. For if I &s;hould, its peace|ful inhabitants would &s;oon feel the baneful influ|ence of the &s;tar which pur&s;ues me and governs my fate. Yes, I am determined in this re&s;olution. From village to village will I transfer my vagrant exi&s;tence: I will tarry no longer in one place than is nece&s;&s;ary for procuring, by labour, the &s;upport of one day; and the hours or my wretched idlene&s;s I will pa&s;s in the &s;olitude of gloomy fore&s;ts. Then will my lot become le&s;s deplorable; then &s;hall I enjoy the mi&s;erable con&s;olation of being alone, and weeping unheard. Ah! how completely I am alone at the pre&s;ent moment&punc; We have not &s;een him during twenty-four long hours!</P>

<P>IN fact, I do not exi&s;t but to find, at every mo|ment, new matters of &s;urpri&s;e. And, fortu|nately, they are &s;ometimes of &s;uch a nature as to comfort and &s;upport me in my trials, and illumine my mind with a cheering ray of hope.</P>
<P>In the morning he came again betimes&mdash;but he came not alone&mdash;he was attended by &mdash;. No, my eyes did not deceive me! No; the re&s;emblance between the young man and the lady I &s;aw in the church was not a mere &s;port of my imagination. There is &s;uch a woman in reality! &s;he has the
<PB N="9" REF="035743_0211_1006B0C564C4A0D0">
&s;ame appearance which, at that time, I fancied &s;he had: for, this day, as far as I could &s;ee her, I knew it was &s;he. Too well do I remember at what time, at what place, and in what attitude I fir&s;t beheld her. What! can her hu&s;band be &s;o cruel as to bring her here to torment me? Perfidi|ous man!&mdash;he comes in this manner to in&s;ult my &s;orrows! My heart was ready to break, and was &s;mitten with the mo&s;t violent re&s;entment. Imagine what joy &s;ucceeded this painful moment! M. Se|vin ran with every mark of lively &s;atisfaction to meet our new vi&s;itant, and in his tran&s;port, he cried, "It is Madame&mdash;:" he called her by name, my &s;i&s;ter. He called the name of one whom M. Dolerval indeed hold dear, but whom he may love without offending any other; one whom he has taught me to admire, by the many prai&s;es he has be&s;towed upon her; a mild, &s;en&s;ible and beneficent woman, in whom is united every virtue, and every grace! An accompli&s;hed woman! In &s;hort, no other than Madame Florival!</P>
<P>Now, my &s;i&s;ter, all is explained. This is Ma|dame Florival. "Come, without delay! Come and unite two lovers! Complete her happine&s;s and mine!" Truly he was impatient for the comple|tion of his Eleanor's vows. Excellent youth! His greate&s;t happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in promoting that of his &s;i&s;ter. What &s;atisfaction mu&s;t &s;he take in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a brother! And I al&s;o &s;hould feel proud if heaven had permitted&mdash;But I am bet|ter plea&s;ed that &s;he enjoys that ble&s;&s;ing! I am bet|ter plea&s;ed! She is un&s;peakably worthy of it.</P>
<P>Now it is out of di&s;pute, that chance has re|vealed the &s;ecret of Madame Florival to me. M. Dolerval is free, him&s;elf! Free to love any one
<PB N="10" REF="035743_0212_1006B0C743659548">
who has merit enough to plea&s;e him. It was &s;he who was married. I am rejoiced at it! She has well done! Since every thing requi&s;ite to render a brave man happy is united in her per&s;on, &s;he has well done!</P>
<P>We entered into conver&s;ation with an ardour almo&s;t equal to affectation; yet it &s;eemed to me of &s;hort continuance, and, if I may believe her, &s;he did not think it long; nor did her brother, I be|lieve, think it longer than our&s;elves. During this intere&s;ting conver&s;ation, he uncea&s;ingly gazed up|on us, and with an air&mdash;an air impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe! When I &s;poke, he ob&s;erved me, and li&s;ten|ed with as much attention as if his life depends on what I was going to &s;ay&punc; and if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s my&s;elf, he pur&s;ued every word as it proceed|ed from my lips to the countenance of his &s;i&s;ter, to &s;ee what impre&s;&s;ion it made there. The attention of M. Dolerval was not, at fir&s;t, free from a &s;ort of &s;trange anxiety; and I could not but be of|fended with it. Could he &s;uppo&s;e I would not en|deavour to gain the good opinion of a per&s;on whom he &s;o highly e&s;teems, and to who&s;e opinion I know he attaches the greate&s;t importance? What rea&s;on has he to fear that I am incapable of gaining her benevolence? Whatever might have been the cau&s;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary for my happine&s;s that he &s;hould be &s;atisfied much &s;ooner. But you cannot form an idea of the &s;atisfaction which &s;hone on the countenance of M. Dolerval whenever Madame Florival honored Juliette with an obliging &s;mile. When &s;he fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed me with a highly flatter|ing compliment, he &s;eemed unable to contain him|&s;elf. And I cannot tell by what &s;ympathetic re|&s;emblance between the two per&s;ons, it happens
<PB N="11" REF="035743_0213_1006B0CF560E29F8">
that the brother fondly returns to the &s;i&s;ter the care&s;&s;es &s;he kindly be&s;tows on me. Twice has &s;he embraced me, and twice has he ki&s;&s;ed her hands.</P>
<P>Before leaving me, &s;he lavi&s;hingly be&s;towed on me the warme&s;t and highe&s;t prai&s;es. Then in a lower voice, and &s;peaking in confidence to her brother, &s;he &s;aid, "The&s;e, my brother, are the natural graces of innocence, mode&s;ty and candour it&s;elf; this is the charm of civility and innocence which comes from the heart, and is void of affec|tation." He an&s;wered in the &s;ame tone, "If &s;o, I am very guilty."</P>
<P>Then my uncle, who &s;eemed like me to give all his attention to this my&s;terious dialogue, &s;aid, with much force of expre&s;&s;ion, "Indeed you are! and an hundred times more &s;o than you can imagine! Su&s;pect my friend&s;hip, my own principles and con|duct, as much as you plea&s;e, and I can overlook it; but her virtue, her mode&s;ty, &s;o worthy of the highe&s;t re&s;pect! O young man, young man!"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, my friend," interrupted M. Doler|val, "pardon me. Be kind enough to obtain her pardon al&s;o&punc; and you, Mademoi&s;elle, will you not permit &mdash;" Here he was &s;topped by his &s;ighs, and was ready to fall at my feet; but a look of his &s;i&s;ter commanded his &s;ilence and forbearance.</P>
<P>On leaving me, Madame Florival de&s;ired my friend&s;hip. Excellent woman! What was there in me to make her de&s;ire it?</P>
<P>But, Celina, what is that in&s;ult for which M. Dolerval reproached him&s;elf with &s;o much bitter|ne&s;s? Could there have been in tho&s;e words he &s;pake the other day, a hidden meaning which was injurious to my character? Well, &s;ince he will have it &s;o, &s;ince he &s;eems to acknowledge it, he has offended me. However, if his &s;i&s;ter had not
<PB N="12" REF="035743_0214_1006B0D9DF1D4D30">
checked him, he would have ca&s;t him&s;elf at my feet! What di&s;cour&s;e, after &s;uch a humiliation, could have been &s;o criminal as to prevent my for|givene&s;s? Oh! whatever has been his fault, it has been effaced by his tears!</P>
<P>It is, I think, almo&s;t needle&s;s to tell you we had no mu&s;ic, although, at fir&s;t, there was &s;ome men|tion of it. This, on the part of M. Dolerval, was but a pretext for this vi&s;it. But the time would have failed us if it had been otherwi&s;e. I forgot to tell you, that during my conver&s;ation with Ma|dame Florival, my uncle appeared to have that calmne&s;s and &s;atisfaction, which, for a long time, I have de&s;ired to find in him again. Certain it is, that this delightful evening has been too &s;hort for us all.</P>

<P>ANOTHER unhappy event has taken place. O my &s;i&s;ter! mu&s;t I be eternally unfortu|nate?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t now, whil&s;t M. Sevin was plunged into one of his u&s;ual reveries, a dome&s;tic brought him a bil|let. He read it immediately, and changing colour, he &s;aid, "Unfortunate Madame Florival! Poor Dolerval! Picard? Tell him I de&s;ire him to wait a little on my account.

<P>"Well, young woman! take advantage of the deplorable condition in which you know me to be; accompli&s;h my mi&s;ery and di&s;grace; cau&s;e me to betray the confidence of a friend. What do I &s;ay? Compel me, hard hearted girl!&mdash;compel me to give you arms again&s;t my&s;elf!"</P>
<P>After this, I &s;aid no more; but &s;eeing me over|whelmed with grief, "All conquering power of beauty!" cried he, "what mortal can be &s;o de&s;ti|tute of feeling as to oppo&s;e your wi&s;hes?" Then he re&s;igned the billet to me, which I tran&s;cribe with eyes full of tears.</P>

<P>JUDGE, my friend, whether I am not to be pitied. Imperious nece&s;&s;ity compels me to quit tho&s;e places which were every day endeared to me more and more. I am forced to leave Elea|nor in de&s;pair. Her hu&s;band, though an upright man, cannot e&s;cape the per&s;ecutions of the envious and evil minded. He did &s;o much violence to his wi&s;hes as to leave the arms of his wife in four days after their marriage. A happy change of circum|&s;tances &s;eemed to require this &s;udden departure for the capital, and the very night he arrived there, he was plunged into the dungeon of the ba&s;tile. We have ju&s;t now received this frightful intelligence. I mu&s;t depart immediately, and, indi&s;pen&s;ably, for Ver&s;ailles; there to remain long enough to take the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps for relieving him, whil&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of my undertaking is but too uncertain.

"Yes, yes, I pardon you, and return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible." The la&s;t words, which he did not require, e&s;caped me unde&s;ignedly,

and, immediately, he fell on his knees before me, and &s;eizing one of my hands, he cla&s;ped it in his, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his brea&s;t. Not a word then pro|ceeded from his mouth; but what words could be &s;o expre&s;&s;ive or energetic as his mild looks and eloquent &s;ilence?

<P>EIGHT long and painful days have glided away &s;ince his departure: and the un&s;peakable grief of his &s;i&s;ter makes it but too evident that he will not &s;oon return. If Madame Florival was not re&s;erved for my comforter, I know not how I could endure this painful ab&s;ence of her brother. We vi&s;it her almo&s;t every day. Beautiful and excellent woman! How often in &s;eeing her, do I behold the features of her brother! It is not the re&s;emblance of their beautiful figures alone, which &s;o forcibly &s;trikes my fancy&punc; no, this amiable per&s;on is en|dowed with graces &s;till more captivating. But they re&s;emble each other much more in their engaging manners; in a voice full of plea&s;ing &s;oftne&s;s, &s;en&s;i|bility and benevolence. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;ees me, &s;he tells me, with an air of un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction, that her brother makes mention of me in all his letters to her. But when, O when, will &s;he be &s;o kind as to &s;how me her brother's letters? He is the continual &s;ubject of our conver&s;ation: for &s;peaking of him, &s;eems to be the only con&s;olation his &s;i&s;ter can enjoy. When I conver&s;e with her concern|ing her own &s;orrows, &s;he is unable to make any reply, and her tears in&s;tantly flow without con|troul; mine are mingled with hers, and M. Se|vin&mdash;M. Sevin, alas! is the mo&s;t unhappy of the three&mdash;he dares not complain! He cannot even weep!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="035743_0220_1006B0FB60637160">Formerly he &s;ought after and pur&s;ued me; now he avoids me. Every hour, the &s;acrifice of which is not imperiou&s;ly commanded by his ill performed duties, he &s;pends in the garden, in the gloomy grove, to which, for &s;ome time, he has had a great attachment. I can &s;ometimes &s;ee him walking there until he can hardly &s;tand, and, through fear of too much afflicting him, I dare not go to inter|rupt him, nor take him away from his &s;trange re|veries. Until the pre&s;ent time, I have found but one mean of bringing him back to the hou&s;e. Mu&s;ic &s;till pre&s;erves over him an entire dominion. Experience, however, has taught me that the &s;ounds of the piano alone are not &s;ufficient to draw him; it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to unite my voice with it. As &s;oon as the harmony of &s;ounds reach his &s;olitude, he leaves it, and comes, as it were in|&s;tinctively, to the door of my apartment, where he &s;tands and li&s;tens, in a fixed and immoveable po&s;ture. There is, my &s;i&s;ter, as I have lately ob|&s;erved, a great alteration in him. Tho&s;e ariettas, &s;o gay, which formerly plea&s;ed him more than any other airs, and which di&s;gu&s;ted me extremely, at pre&s;ent, have but little effect upon him. There are none but plaintive &s;ounds that can &s;often his grief. But as &s;oon as I leave the in&s;trument he returns to his &s;olitary grove, and if I &s;hould wi&s;h him to retire precipitately, I need but &s;ing one cou|plet of my favourite &s;ong, and the work is done.</P>
<P>But, in a little time, I found, to my vexation, that I could not have my accu&s;tomed &s;ucce&s;s. In|&s;tead of coming to the door of my apartment, my unhappy uncle had &s;topped under the window. Tired with long and fruitle&s;s trials, at length I went into the yard, where I found him reclining on a &s;tone bench, in a &s;ort of lethargic drow&s;i|ne&s;s.
<PB N="19" REF="035743_0221_1006B1015B63CF70">
Judge what mu&s;t have been his condition. When he awoke, he found him&s;elf too feeble to vi&s;it Madame Florival. He was but ju&s;t able to draw him&s;elf from the yard to the fatal grove, where he returned to his former &s;upine condition. Notwith&s;tanding all the anxiety I felt, and all the pains I could take, I could not get him to the hou&s;e till &s;un-&s;et. When I pre&s;ented him &s;ome nouri&s;h|ment, I thought proper to remind him, "that he had not taken any for almo&s;t twenty-four hours."</P>
<P>"What of that," &s;aid he, "if I am not hungry?"</P>
<P>"O my uncle, my dear uncle! would you then wi&s;h to die?"</P>
<P>"Why not, my girl, when one lives only to &s;uffer?"</P>
<P>After this, he retired to his chamber. Still could I &s;ee he had a light. And, in the morning, if I &s;hould awake by break of day, I &s;hould find that M. Sevin had the &s;tart of me. I have every rea&s;on to believe that &s;leep &s;eldom &s;hortens his nights.</P>
<P>To pre&s;ent this frightful picture of his mi&s;ery to you I am &s;en&s;ible is no more than my duty. There is no rea&s;on for he&s;itation; I mu&s;t depart&mdash; without delay! How can I &s;tay any longer in a hou&s;e where I occa&s;ion the perpetual unhappine&s;s of the mo&s;t generous, mo&s;t unfortunate of men? I mu&s;t leave him My ab&s;ence cannot occa&s;ion evils comparable to tho&s;e which my re&s;idence in this place brings with it. Yet, what will become of me I know not: but longer I cannot &s;tay. But what will the young man do if he &s;hould not find me at his return? Alas! he could not &s;urvive it! And, my&s;elf!&mdash;Ah, my &s;i&s;ter, do I not injure my|&s;elf by encouraging a groundle&s;s hope? Do you believe Madame Florival would&mdash;? But whether &s;he will receive or reject me, I mu&s;t depart.</P>

<P>THIS morning I aro&s;e very early. My uncle had already gone down. "What!" &s;aid he, "have you ri&s;en &s;o early? You mu&s;t then have fore&s;een that it was good to prolong this morning." Upon this, he propo&s;ed going into the garden. We walked about in it, and in every part except the grove. After this he de&s;ired me to water &s;ome flowers, and prop a honey&s;uckle; then he whi&s;tled for his darling birds, and called them together to receive my care&s;&s;es. Not long afterwards, in compliance with his de&s;ire, we re|turned into the hou&s;e, where I per&s;uaded him to take breakfa&s;t with me, more ea&s;ily than I expect|ed. After breakfa&s;t he urged me to &s;ing: at length, when the clock &s;truck nine, with great agitation of mind, he &s;aid, "It is time! Come, Juliette, it is time! We did not vi&s;it Madame Florival ye&s;ter|day; will you be &s;o kind as to carry her this let|ter?"</P>
<P>"Very readily, my uncle." Then I was go|ing, but he called me back.</P>
<P>"What! &s;o fa&s;t! Alas! where were you run|ning? I a&s;k for one moment, Juliette! But one moment."</P>
<P>"My uncle, I intended by my readine&s;s to give you a proof&mdash;" He would not &s;uffer me to fini&s;h my &s;entence, but, with a voice at once the mo&s;t

tender and affecting, "Juliette," &s;aid he, "adieu! adieu, my girl!"</P>
<P>"But, in a little time, I &mdash;."</P>
<P>"My niece," interrupted he, "the &s;horte&s;t jour|ney may occa&s;ion a long ab&s;ence; do not, there|fore, refu&s;e to bid me farewell."</P>
<P>"What do I hear? You frighten me! You have, I fear, contrived &s;ome fatal project again&s;t your&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"Who? me, my girl? me? You are then but little acquainted with me &s;till! I am able to be unhappy, Juliette; but never, never &s;hall I be criminal. Be comforted, I &s;hall live&mdash;Alas! I &s;hall yet live!&mdash;You, however, dear and too amiable girl, go, carry this letter to your worthy friend, and&mdash;farewell forever!"</P>
<P>Then he fell into a chair. His countenance di&s;|covered &s;ymptoms of great alteration, and his trem|bling frame was &s;eized with a convul&s;ive motion.</P>
<P>"O my uncle! my uncle!"</P>
<P>"Let not my condition affrighten you," &s;aid he; "my eyes have, for a long time, been tearle&s;s. My tears are now ready to &s;tifle me; they are &s;eeking a pa&s;&s;age: If I could weep, I &s;hould be &s;aved. But, go away, my girl, go away then&mdash;I order you to do &s;o, in the name of the greate&s;t &s;acrifice of which a man can be capable; in the name of the &s;acrifice I mu&s;t impo&s;e on my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"My uncle, my dear uncle, adieu!"</P>
<P>"Go, Juliette! charming girl, go! And if you ever deign to remember me, O, I conjure you! let it not be merely a compa&s;&s;ionate remembrance. Juliette, let it be al&s;o what I have, perhaps, merit|ed; a remembrance of benevolence and e&s;teem."</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words melted me into a tran&s;port of compa&s;&s;ion, which reached to the bottom of my
<PB N="22" REF="035743_0224_1006B1130B67C8D8">
&s;oul, and which I could not moderate. My uncle reached forth his hand to take hold of mine; I took it in mine and pre&s;&s;ed it to my lips, whil&s;t a tear from my eyes fell upon it; then forced my&s;elf away from him precipitately, and, as I went acro&s;s the yard, I &s;till heard the &s;ighs of this unfortunate man; and, as I &s;hut the par&s;onage door after me, my ears were again &s;aluted with an adieu. This, Ce|lina, was the la&s;t; but, &s;hould I live an hundred years longer, it would not for&s;ake my remem|brance.</P>
<P>In a little time I arrived at Madame Florival's, with a confu&s;ion of mind beyond the power of de|&s;cription. My &s;pirits were not only agitated by what I had ju&s;t &s;een and heard, but, by an anxious curio&s;ity to know whether there were not &s;ome in|di&s;crete demands, contained in the letter of which I was the bearer, and waited with the livelie&s;t anx|iety, to &s;ee what effect the reading of it would pro|duce. She read it through, with the greate&s;t ra|pidity, and mo&s;t eager curio&s;ity. Madame Flori|val, whil&s;t reading it, di&s;covered &s;igns of &s;urpri&s;e, &s;adne&s;s and joy. Then, in&s;tead of giving me any explanation, &s;he took me by the hand, and con|ducted me into a neighbouring apartment.</P>
<P>"My dear Juliette," then &s;aid &s;he, "this is the chamber which I hope you will plea&s;e to occupy. In my hou&s;e, I would have you con&s;ider your&s;elf the ab&s;olute mi&s;tre&s;s of your time and employments&punc; vouch&s;afe to become, in this place, my &s;econd &s;elf. Ah! if my con&s;olations are needful for you, they are not more &s;o than yours are for me!"</P>
<P>"Madame &mdash;"</P>
<P>"No, my friend," &s;aid &s;he, embracing me, "do not call me &s;o; my friend is the appellation I de|&s;ire you to make u&s;e of."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="035743_0225_1006B1164AC2F588">"O, my friend!" an&s;wered I, "my generous friend, I am &s;till ignorant of what he wrote you; but you&mdash;if you knew in what a dreadful condition I left him &mdash;."</P>
<P>"As to what he wrote me," an&s;wered &s;he, "giving me the letter, you &s;hall &s;ee for your&s;elf. And, re&s;pecting the condition in which you left him, do not be concerned. He &s;hall have the con&s;tant attendance of one of our dome&s;tics, who &s;hall watch over him continually, and never leave him. I promi&s;e you, he &s;hall have the be&s;t attention paid him. Dolerval and I have both the means and di&s;po&s;ition for preventing his friend from ever be|ing in want. I will now leave you; you &s;eem to &s;tand in need of a little recollection; whenever it becomes inconvenient for you to be alone, you will know where to find me."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, &s;he withdrew, leaving me in a deep and plea&s;ing contemplation of the dignity and &s;implicity of the manner in which this cele&s;tial woman be&s;tows her benefits.</P>
<P>I will not tell you, my dear Celina, how many tears I &s;hed on reading the letter of my unfortunate uncle, but limit my&s;elf to &s;ending a copy of it to you.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>St. Cyr,
<DATE>Augu&s;t 28, 1782,
2 o'clock morning.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AT length the fatal hour is come. The &s;ur|rounding darkne&s;s of the night is not &s;o gloomy as that which begins to cloud my rea&s;on. My virtue, my too feeble virtue, begins to fail me. Perhaps in another day, I may lo&s;e the fruit of my painful re&s;i&s;tance. Perhaps I may &s;o far lo&s;e my &s;en&s;es, as to alarm her virtuous mind with a de|claration &s;he ought never to hear. The fatal hour is come&mdash;It urges the cruel &s;acrifice&mdash;Nothing re|mains but &s;eparation. How it wounds and tor|tures my heart! Let a great misfortune &s;pare me the pain of a &s;till greater! and, &s;ince I mu&s;t lo&s;e her forever, O that it might be without having of|fended her!</P>
<P>To you, Madame, appertains the honor of re|ceiving her. To your virtues is due the reward of being intru&s;ted with the object of your brother's innocent love, and my culpable tenderne&s;s. Cul|pable! Ah, wherefore! Wherefore this differ|ence between the unfortunate Sevin, and the too fortunate Dolerval? From whence came tho&s;e in|iquitous in&s;titutions by which I am deprived of tho&s;e privileges which he is permitted to enjoy? By what miracle has it happened that I am not, like him, allowed to be a human being? What power binds on earth tho&s;e faculties which heaven has be|&s;towed upon me, and of which it has given the lawful exerci&s;e? O, barbarous men! who, with|out
<PB N="25" REF="035743_0227_1006B12348C8BFB0">
blu&s;hing, have declared, that on the day I &s;hould become a prie&s;t, I mu&s;t cea&s;e to love what God, in his bounty towards men, has created mo&s;t beautiful and de&s;irable; why did you not al&s;o or|dain, that on the &s;ame day I mu&s;t never more have any ears capable of hearing, nor eyes of &s;eeing&mdash; and, above all things, why did you not deprive me of a heart which is capable of &s;en&s;ation? But of what con&s;equence is it to them, to give to us in particular, laws which are unju&s;t, ab&s;urd, and impracticable? Are they not always above the law them&s;elves? They make them for none but us&mdash; for us who would not be worthy of their notice, if they could not derive &s;ome advantage from our oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;for us, vile, degenerate and de&s;picable race&mdash;and, truly, de&s;picable in the highe&s;t degree; becau&s;e, in our abject &s;tupidity, we conceive it &s;omewhat honorable to obey them.</P>
<P>And &s;hould any of us feel a di&s;po&s;ition for di&s;|obeying them, by what means could we free our|&s;elves from the chains by which we are bound? As for me, unhappy mortal, what is re&s;erved me but the human &s;hape? What girl&mdash;what mode&s;t and virtuous girl, like her&punc; could behold my out|ward dre&s;s, and &s;u&s;pect me of belonging to the hu|man race? And if, in the extremity of an idle hope, I had pre&s;umed to &s;ay, "Juliette, I mu&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;s you, and cannot live without you," would &s;he not have in&s;tantly &s;aid, "Simple man, what a propo&s;al is this! Look upon your gloomy habits; they are to me a continual &s;ign of your reproba|tion; you wear your own mourning &s;uit. Go, unhappy being! open the doors of Hymen's tem|ple to all who reque&s;t it of you; but, as for your|&s;elf, you mu&s;t never enter therein. In &s;o doing, you would go to the altar with u&s;ele&s;s vows: for
<PB N="26" REF="035743_0228_1006B12F5F7D0130">
your God, &s;ince men have forbidden him, could never receive them."</P>
<P>Oh, how different would have been my circum|&s;tances, had it been po&s;&s;ible for me to go into &s;ome other profe&s;&s;ion (though reputed le&s;s honorable), in which I might have re&s;umed the dignity of my being! Then, perhaps, too fortunate Dolerval, you would not have taken her from me! In &s;uch ca&s;e, I might have dared to contend with you; with even you, the mo&s;t amiable of men! But is not the mo&s;t amiable, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible? And who, however, could have loved her &s;o much as I could have adored her?&mdash;O hap|pine&s;s!&mdash;Supreme felicity! Then &s;he might have become mine!&mdash;Then it would have been in her power to love me, and mine to obtain her!&mdash;O let's abandon this idea! It is dreadful! In&s;upport|able! It enkindles in my brea&s;t a flame which con&s;umes me! My blood is all inflamed! I feel a heart-breaking! A de&s;pair!&mdash;What do I hear? All the &s;outh winds have bur&s;t their pri&s;ons!&mdash;The lightning cleaves the clouds!&mdash;The thunder roars! Withhold, avenging God! withhold thy dread|ful hand! I am running forth to meet thy fatal bolts, that thou maye&s;t annihilate me!</P>
<P>Four o'clock morning.</P>
<P>How have I interrupted this letter? Who has tran&s;ported me to the grove which I have ju&s;t quit|ted? With what gloomy, oppre&s;&s;ive &s;leep was I there &s;urpri&s;ed! And, O with what dreams was I &s;uddenly a&s;&s;aulted! What, in &s;hort, is the condi|tion in which I have ju&s;t been? Let's read again&mdash; The winds, lightning, thunder!&mdash;Alas! when I awoke there was an univer&s;al calm throughout na|ture: the &s;torm was only in my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="035743_0229_1006B1339CAE8B68">Ah! for pity's &s;ake remove this lovely girl, who&s;e pre&s;ence delights and di&s;tre&s;&s;es me; who&s;e voice delights mine ears, and, at the &s;ame time, cruelly wounds my heart; who&s;e very looks charm me, and inflame my &s;oul with pa&s;&s;ion: this dangerous fair one, who &s;peaks not a word which I do not retain, makes not a ge&s;ture which I do not applaud, not a motion which I do not admire; and who&s;e every motion, every ge&s;ture, and every word diffu|&s;es through all my &s;en&s;es a mortal poi&s;on. Let her be removed! it is time &s;he was &s;natched away, and perhaps already too late!</P>
<P>To your care, Madame, do I now commit her. Protect her in your turn. Is it not nece&s;&s;ary, even for her &s;ecurity, that you &s;hould be acquainted with all the intere&s;t which her youth, mo&s;t inhu|manly per&s;ecuted, is calculated to in&s;pire? And, &s;ince an avowal of my own wretched condition has e&s;caped me, &s;he cannot but pardon me for re|vealing the &s;ecrets of her misfortunes, exempt from blame. I do not doubt what &s;he has told me, and it would be criminal in me to di&s;believe it; yet it mu&s;t appear impo&s;&s;ible to you, Madame, that there are now in being &s;ome mon&s;ters, in human &s;hape, who hate and wi&s;h to de&s;troy this ma&s;ter-piece of nature and education. Defend Juliette, in your turn, from their fury&mdash;Comfort and &s;hield her from the iniquity of tho&s;e who are unequalled in barbarity. Juliette, no!&mdash;&s;he is not Juliette; nor the niece of poor Sevin. According to our preju|dices, heaven mu&s;t have be&s;towed on her a noble origin; but whatever the hi&s;tory of her birth and parentage may prove, heaven has done her inju&s;|tice in not placing her upon a throne. Tranquil in my retirement&punc; I did not know there was a cre|ated human being &s;o &s;uperior to all others. One
<PB N="28" REF="035743_0230_1006B139EEF47A30">
day, at the ri&s;ing light of the morning, &s;he came hither; but the crim&s;on morning dawn was le&s;s brilliant than her&s;elf; her lu&s;tre was &s;uperior to the brighte&s;t morning. She came, attended with all her graces, captivating in her terror, powerful in her di&s;tre&s;s and forlorn circum&s;tances. She ap|peared, &s;poke, and whatever were her de&s;ires, they were granted. Unmindful of the con&s;equences, I imagined my&s;elf &s;upremely happy in receiving in|to my hou&s;e this daughter of heaven. Ah! what pre&s;umption! I did not perceive, that though I might have defied nature when her voice alone was heard, that &s;he was altogether irre&s;i&s;tible when her power was augmented by the all-conquering power of beauty!</P>
<P>How dearly have I purcha&s;ed this error of my &s;elf-confidence! And O how wonderful is the ex|travagance of my error! Notwith&s;tanding what I have &s;uffered, and though I might &s;uffer &s;till more, I &s;hould dread no approaching misfortune &s;o greatly as an expectation of falling into my former indif|ference. All tho&s;e &s;weet and painful &s;entiments which convey to the minds of mortals that pa&s;&s;ion which always holds dominion over the various pa&s;|&s;ions that it in&s;pires&punc; I have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and at the &s;ame time, nouri&s;hed in all their plenitude. I have become acquainted with the growing confu|&s;ion, mode&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment, timid reveries, affect|ing languors, virtuous &s;acrifices, and prudent cir|cum&s;pection of love. I have experienced the pain|ful &s;weetne&s;s of tho&s;e inward conflicts it rai&s;es in the mind; the &s;oothing folly of its hopes, and the lively enchantment of its dreams. Alas! I have not, at all times, vanqui&s;hed its powerful energy, its violent de&s;ires, nor its culpable projects. More e&s;pecially have I, to my &s;orrow, experienced the
<PB N="29" REF="035743_0231_1006B13D77C582F8">
effect of jealou&s;y, that gnawing vulture, which I have an hundred times vanqui&s;hed, and which has a thou&s;and times reigned triumphant. O Dolerval! my friend, pardon me! You can and ought to do it. The exerci&s;e of clemency is ea&s;y to the pre|ferred rival. O fortunate Dolerval! whoever has merit enough to gain her affections, is mo&s;t wor|thy of obtaining her. Po&s;&s;e&s;s her&mdash;render her hap|py&mdash;this is my mo&s;t ardent and plea&s;ing expecta|tion. The greate&s;t con&s;olation I &s;hall enjoy, will be a hope and expectation of her felicity.</P>
<P>Tell her, Madame&mdash;no, do not tell her any thing. Put this letter&mdash;into her hands, I pray you. Alas! Juliette, when you &s;hall read this letter, I &s;hall be left alone in the world&mdash;ab&s;olutely alone! This abode &s;hall never more be adorned with her pre&s;ence. I &s;hall lo&s;e her, and that forever! The unhappy Sevin will be ready to die with grief for the lo&s;s. Oh, Juliette! conde&s;cend to receive &s;omething by which you may remember me. Re|ceive this as a monument of my weakne&s;s, and the power of your charms. Deign to receive and pre|&s;erve it. Juliette, it will bring to your remem|brance my unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion, of which you ought always to have been ignorant; but it will al&s;o unfold to you the &s;entiments of that profound re&s;pect, which I could not but always entertain for you; of that truly religious re&s;pect which your all-powerful virtues have commanded me to ob|&s;erve, in re&s;i&s;ting even &s;uch charms as yours.</P>
<P>As for me, when the a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand of time &s;hall have healed the wounds of my heart, I &s;hall inve&s;t my&s;elf with the &s;weete&s;t recollections of pa&s;t hap|pine&s;s; I &s;hall often go into the garden where I have &s;een her labour and &s;port, active as the graces, nimble as the zephyr. There &s;hall my feet often

trace out the impre&s;&s;ion of her &s;teps. The flowers &s;he has cultivated I &s;hall endeavour to render im|mortal. Her favourite among&s;t my birds, at pre|&s;ent the one I mo&s;t highly value, will ea&s;ily learn to repeat her name. Sometimes I &s;hall return from the garden and &s;eat my&s;elf by the in&s;trument which was agitated by her brilliant and active hands. There, with a li&s;tening ear, &s;hall I &s;till endeavour to hear the accents of the mo&s;t enchanting of voices. But never, no, never &s;hall I dare to profane, with a &s;ingle look, the &s;anctuary where her nights have peacefully glided away.</P>
<P>Thus, in my retirement, every object around me will bring her to my remembrance, and her beauteous image will be impre&s;t on my imagina|tion, till my late&s;t breath.</P>

<P>YOUR new troubles, my deare&s;t Celina, mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affect me! How I wi&s;h I could fly to Paris and render you all the con&s;olation in my power! But a mother's hatred, and the barbarity of a brother, have forever &s;eparated me from you.

How can I forbear complaining my&s;elf, when every per|&s;on, with whom I am connected, is &s;urrounded with misfortunes? This woman, who numbers her

<P>You will probably remember that I was at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed that Madame Florival did not interrogate me concerning my &s;ecrets, which were in part re|vealed in M. Sevin's letter. Afterwards I reflected upon the matter, and &s;uppo&s;ed it might be a nece&s;|&s;ary caution on her part; a point of delicacy which her circum&s;tances impo&s;ed on her. For how could &s;he require her friends to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecrets of their heart, when &s;he could not honor them with a di&s;|clo&s;ure of her own? Every one believes her to be in widowhood; &s;he continues to keep as a &s;ecret, the circum&s;tance of her &s;econd marriage, believing me to be unacquainted with it. I do not attempt any mea&s;ures calculated to make her di&s;cover her &s;ecret, nor &s;hall I permit her to know that it has come to my knowledge. And &s;ince &s;he thinks proper to deny me &s;uch a te&s;timony of her confi|dence, I look upon her as the obliged per&s;on. But I am &s;till deprived of the greate&s;t con&s;olation which my pre&s;ent &s;ituation could po&s;&s;ibly give me, that of knowing what her brother &s;ays of me in the let|ters which every courier regularly brings. This, without doubt, is the rea&s;on why the time appears to be long, even in the &s;ociety of this excellent wo|man.</P>
<P>This is not the only occa&s;ion of my feeling anx|ious and di&s;contented. M. Sevin &s;till continues in

a di&s;ordered &s;tate of mind. His regret on account of our &s;eparation has thrown him into a langui&s;h|ing &s;tate, from which he will not &s;oon recover. We &s;end every morning to inquire after his health: my amiable friend goes thither every evening; and I, Celina, wait at home with impatience, till they return and inform me whether he is any better. You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that I cannot go thither my|&s;elf. Poor M. Sevin! Never mu&s;t I vi&s;it him again!</P>
<P>When I thus behold every per&s;on who has a re|gard for me per&s;ecuted with misfortunes. I &s;ome|times &s;ay to my&s;elf, with bitter reflections, though without much foundation, that perhaps the gene|rous Bovile might &s;till have been alive, if he had not too much lamented my fate. His de&s;tiny, I &s;ometimes think, has been influenced by mine. Then I tremble, le&s;t Madame Florival, &s;o amiable and benevolent, may &s;ooner or later repent that &s;he ever knew me. O heavens! If any misfortune &s;hould happen to her brother!&mdash;My thoughts are &s;o gloomy that a relation of them would only aug|ment your pre&s;ent afflictions. Adieu.</P>

<P>MY dear Celina, congratulate your &s;i&s;ter; he has been here during ten days: but, in fact, I at pre&s;ent &s;tand in need of your pity; for, to-morrow he will leave us again.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="035743_0235_1006B15908A84730">In what a plea&s;ing enchantment have glided tho&s;e happy hours! How powerful are the pa&s;&s;ions of human nature, which can &s;horten time or prolong it at plea&s;ure! While he was ab&s;ent, hours were, &s;eemingly, augmented to ages; on the contrary, ten days in his company, have la&s;ted, as it were, but a moment.</P>
<P>But who can paint the charms of our employ|ments or recreations? Who can expre&s;s the plea|&s;ures of our conver&s;ation, and even of his &s;ilence? In his &s;ilence, what a plea&s;ing expre&s;&s;ion is di&s;co|verable! How eager are his cares, and how ten|der his attentions! And yet, what a re&s;pectful re&s;erve in his di&s;cour&s;e, and delicate moderation in his manners! Could you have believed, that &s;ince his return, he has not, in the lea&s;t, declared to me the pa&s;&s;ion with which he is &s;o manife&s;tly in&s;pired? It is true, his &s;i&s;ter &mdash; Oh how &s;he is idolized by him, and how he is beloved by her! And how tenderly, in appearance, do both of them regard me! His &s;i&s;ter is continually with me, and could &s;carcely live without me. If he is but a &s;hort time from his Eleanor, he is unea&s;y till he finds her again. You may perceive by this that we are almo&s;t in&s;eparable: in&s;omuch, that I am &s;ometimes ready to a&s;k my&s;elf, whether the &s;i&s;ter is not more tenderly attached to me than her brother, and whe|ther the brother has not more friend&s;hip for her than love for me. But I am per&s;uaded he would not pur&s;ue his &s;i&s;ter with &s;o much ardour, if he did not know there was another per&s;on by whom &s;he was always attended. Often have I heard him, when he has returned home warm with fatigue, inquire, as &s;oon as he entered the hou&s;e, "Picard! where is the young lady?" And, &s;topping &s;hort,
<PB N="34" REF="035743_0236_1006B160CD132718">
turn to his &s;i&s;ter and &s;ay, "Madame Florival, do me the plea&s;ure of telling me where &s;he is."</P>
<P>This tender union, which reigns equally and mu|tually between two per&s;ons, alike actuated by na|ture's chief affections, one would think, ought al|ways to &s;eem an enchanting &s;pectacle. In&s;tead of this, it has often &s;eized my heart with a mo&s;t weighty affliction, by embittering, my dear Ce|lina, the regret of our eternal &s;eparation. Often, by a recollection &s;till more dreadful, it penetrates my very &s;oul with an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;entiment of horror and dread again&s;t &mdash;. Alas! can I never free my&s;elf from that dreadful remembrance? Shall I never be &s;o happy as to forget my barbarous bro|ther?</P>
<P>Let us turn our attention another way; let us fix our thoughts on this intere&s;ting couple&mdash;this perfect model of fraternal love. How worthy is the young man of in&s;piring all the mild &s;entiments he experiences! And how greatly does Madame Florival merit his kind regard; who, much more by her examples than her precepts, has unfolded every amiable di&s;po&s;ition of her brother!</P>
<P>This heavenly woman mu&s;t always be a great gainer by being known. Whoever, by accident, or only at times, falls in her way, will not fail of being captivated with her talents and attractive qualities; but in the happine&s;s of an intimate con|nection alone can any one know how to appre|ciate the value of her &s;oul. Her mind is &s;till more engaging than her per&s;on! And to what can we compare her genius, &s;o well cultivated; and her per&s;on, favoured with &s;o many natural graces; her per&s;onal dignity, and that &s;weet equality of temper, which her la&s;ting grief has not altered; &s;o well as
<PB N="35" REF="035743_0237_1006B16921AC8390">
to the excellent genius, amiable mind, and agree|able temper of her brother and pupil?</P>
<P>And do you not think he is equal to her in the qualities of his heart? But to-morrow, Celina, he is going to leave us. He &s;eems to be much afflict|ed at the thoughts of it, and it is very evident from his behaviour, that he cannot bear to part with us. But &s;till he does &s;o much violence to his inclinations as to leave me! And wherefore? For the purpo&s;e of terminating the &s;orrows of his &s;i&s;ter; or, per|haps, merely with a de&s;ign of &s;upporting her with dreams of plea&s;ing hope.</P>
<P>If you would wi&s;h to know to what degree he extends his friendly conduct, I will tell you. He has brought with him a phy&s;ician from Paris, for the purpo&s;e of attending my unhappy uncle. He now a&s;&s;ures me that M. Sevin is out of danger. But he needs the greate&s;t attention; and if he is not well attended, perhaps, after a few months of lan|gui&s;hment, the melancholy &s;tate he is in will car|ry him to his grave. Poor M. Sevin! where|fore did he ever know me? Or rather, why was he placed in a condition which is un&s;uitable for a man of &s;en&s;ibility? Poor unfortunate man!</P>
<P>His friend vi&s;its him every morning and evening, and often &s;tays with him an hour, and &s;ometimes longer. He always returns from the par&s;onage with a &s;ad countenance and heavy heart. And I cannot but greatly e&s;teem his commi&s;eration and &s;olicitude for the Curate, in which I take a &s;hare.</P>
<P>It &s;eems fortunate that I can perceive him to be tormented with anxiety on another account; I &s;ay fortunate, becau&s;e the extreme re&s;erve which I &s;o much admired in him, and which I mu&s;t own af|fected me to a great degree, would, notwith&s;tand|ing, become quite perplexing, were it not ea&s;y to
<PB N="36" REF="035743_0238_1006B16C819D6420">
perceive that he kept &s;ilence with great difficulty. Sometimes, after a few minutes of deep contem|plation and evident irre&s;olution, led by an involun|tary tran&s;port, he &s;eems ready to declare his hopes or fears. But Madame Florival, who has a power|ful a&s;cendency over him, by one word, one ge&s;ture, or one forbidding look, immediately repre&s;&s;es the&s;e violent emotions. She &s;eems, in fact, like a power|ful divinity, who has the entire dominion of this young man's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and tractable &s;oul, even in its mo&s;t lively agitations.</P>
<P>But to-morrow he expects to leave us. To-morrow&mdash;we &s;hall have a melancholy parting.</P>

<P>AH, how pa&s;&s;ionate were his parting words! I did not imagine what it was which ren|dered them mo&s;t intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>He was going away almo&s;t in de&s;pair. And I, with a trembling voice, a heart ready to break with &s;ighing, and eyes overflowing with tears, &s;carcely dared to expre&s;s my wi&s;hes for his &s;peedy return. But I had no &s;ooner done &s;o, than he &s;uddenly came back, and coming precipitately towards us, he ca&s;t him&s;elf at my feet. His &s;i&s;ter endeavoured to check this new and &s;udden tran&s;port.</P>
<P>"No, no," cried he, "I will re&s;i&s;t my wi&s;hes no longer; I have &s;uffered too much by my painful &s;ilence already." Then directing his di&s;cour&s;e to
<PB N="37" REF="035743_0239_1006B171F8DE8860">
me, he &s;aid, "I am extremely unhappy! The af|fection I have for you, this pure and lawful affec|tion, does not move you. You &s;eem determined to continue a &s;tranger. You ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in being known to us by no other name than Juliette. And you, my &s;i&s;ter, oblige her to make her&s;elf known. Leave, Eleanor, that delicacy which de|&s;troys me. Begin by entru&s;ting her with your &s;e|crets&mdash;entru&s;t her with them out of pity towards me!"</P>
<P>Madame Florival was about to &s;peak, but I ha&s;tily prevented her.</P>
<P>"My friend," &s;aid I, "it would give me great &s;atisfaction to be favoured with your confidence, and I &s;hould glory in &s;howing my&s;elf worthy of it. But I mu&s;t inform you beforehand, that it will not, in the lea&s;t, incline me to make the explanations you require. You have, for a long time, &s;eemed worthy of acquiring all my confidence; but the rea&s;on I have not di&s;clo&s;ed my &s;ecrets to you, is becau&s;e I am unfortunately doomed to retain them forever."</P>
<P>"My dear Juliette," an&s;wered &s;he, "do not wait for me to ju&s;tify my di&s;cretion: I will leave you to appreciate the motives of it your&s;elf. There &s;eems no longer to be any nece&s;&s;ity of denying my&s;elf the con&s;olation of &s;uch a friend as you: re|ceive, therefore, my confe&s;&s;ions." Then &s;he in|formed me of what &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed I was ignorant; her &s;econd marriage, and the captivity of her hu&s;|band. "This," added &s;he, "is all I am permitted to tell you. I cannot reveal the name of my hu&s;|band, nor the unhappy events which obliged him to live unknown, becau&s;e the&s;e are &s;ecrets which I think belong to his di&s;cretion only. Would he have intru&s;ted you with them, Dolerval, if he had
<PB N="38" REF="035743_0240_1006B177AD070210">
&s;uppo&s;ed you would make no &s;cruple of revealing them to the per&s;on you &s;hould love? This young lady, you &s;ay, is worthy of our entire confidence. Do not, I pray you, repeat &s;uch a dangerous ob|jection any more. There is no lover who would not tell you the &s;ame concerning the per&s;on of his choice. Thus the principle, however inconte&s;ta|ble it might be in it&s;elf, would be de&s;troyed by a multitude of exceptions; by the&s;e means, friend|&s;hip could have no &s;ecrets which love could not di&s;cover. Dolerval, I have often told you, and have lately had the &s;ad experience of it, that when we would wi&s;h to perform painful duties, we &s;hould never allow our&s;elves to rea&s;on with them."</P>
<P>In the mean time her brother &s;eemed not to hear her, for he was, apparently, in complete de|&s;pair.</P>
<P>"Never," cried he pitifully, "never &s;hall we know her hi&s;tory! Never &s;hall I be able to obtain her! And the hope of a fortunate union, which &s;upported&mdash;."</P>
<P>"You &s;ee," interrupted Madame Florival, cla&s;ping me in her arms, "the love he entertains for you. One word from you would greatly le&s;|&s;en the &s;everity of my misfortunes, becau&s;e you would thereby begin the happine&s;s of his life. It &s;eems &s;trange, that you cannot, like me, reveal &s;uch part of your hi&s;tory and misfortunes as re|&s;pects you in particular! And &s;ince it is &s;aid to be po&s;&s;ible for you to have enemies, you might, as to whatever concerned them, be &s;ilent."</P>
<P>What &s;hall I tell you, Celina? Whether the reflections of Madame Florival in&s;pired me with courage and hope, or whether the &s;ight of her bro|ther, in &s;o much unhappine&s;s, was more than I could bear, I will not try to determine. Be it as
<PB N="39" REF="035743_0241_1006B181956B0070">
it may, I could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf in the following words:</P>
<P>"However fortunate the union you &s;peak of may now appear, I am too well acquainted with you to believe you could well enjoy it while your &s;i&s;ter remained unhappy. Go, Dolerval, labour to re&s;tore her the hu&s;band &s;he adores. Make ha&s;te to procure his relea&s;e from confinement. Then I &s;hall &s;ee&mdash; you &s;hall be informed of the greater part of my misfortunes&mdash;If it is po&s;&s;ible I will tell you my name&mdash;and you &s;hall then judge what means are &s;ufficient to &s;urmount the numerous ob|&s;tacles &mdash;."</P>
<P>The impatience of his rapture was &s;o great, that he could not permit me to fini&s;h my &s;peech. His &s;i&s;ter was loaded with care&s;&s;es, and I with the mo&s;t tender thanks; and then, to my &s;urpri&s;e, he beg|ged permi&s;&s;ion to write to me.</P>
<P>"Directly?" &s;aid I, "no&mdash;no&mdash;well, let it be only once: at the moment when your brother-in-law &s;hall be &s;et at liberty! Let the joyful news be directed to me: let it be me who &s;hall have the un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction of informing my friend of this happy intelligence!&mdash;And you mu&s;t endea|vour, Dolerval, to arrive as &s;oon as your letter."</P>
<P>Scarcely had I done &s;peaking when Madame Florival tenderly embraced me. And Dolerval, on receiving my hand, which his &s;i&s;ter joined to his, &s;hed tears of joy. And now the pre&s;&s;ing time of departure had come: an hundred times did he en|deavour to go, and as many times did he return. At length he is gone&mdash;now we are left alone.</P>

<P>At length, the long wi&s;hed for moment has come, when I can, without danger&punc; di&s;clo&s;e to you the &s;ecret joys of my heart. That angelic per&s;on, my brother, whom you treated with &s;uch inju&s;tice in your letters, was not M. Sevin's niece, in any &s;en&s;e of the word.

<P>VARMONT, I &s;uppo&s;ed you had committed an outrage upon Mademoi&s;elle de Terville, for which rea&s;on, I was vexed at you in the highe&s;t degree: you &s;uppo&s;ed I was her ob&s;tinate and un|relenting guardian, and you was, therefore, as &s;ul|len as a dunce.

<P>O my &s;i&s;ter, my &s;i&s;ter! what a rever&s;e! Now I am convinced (I can almo&s;t &s;ay), that heaven has created me for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of exhau&s;t|ing its wrath upon me, and making me a tormentor of all my intimate acquaintances.</P>
<P>My friend mea&s;ured the time by her impatience: the afternoon &s;eemed endle&s;s. At length the rat|tling of a po&s;t-chai&s;e &s;tartled us, and prepared us for the plea&s;ure of their reception. This &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tranger, who&s;e return was probably ha&s;tened by

my engagements with Dolerval, entered fir&s;t; without perceiving me, he entered, for all his at|tention was fixed upon his wife, whom he pre&s;&s;ed in his arms. For my part, alas! I &s;aw him but too plainly; and too plainly do I behold him &s;till! But I could not command my eyes from being im|moveably fixed upon him; not becau&s;e it required a long examination to recogni&s;e him, for the more I beheld him, the more I a&s;ked my&s;elf, in deep amazement, whether I was really awake? Whe|ther the object before me was not a dear but de|lu&s;ive and per&s;ecuting phantom which troubled my fight? Whether it was not a delu&s;ion of my &s;en&s;es, proceeding from a dream at once plea&s;ing and pain|ful? This brother-in-law &s;pake to my friend; this brother-in-law, who was conducted hither by a young man who expected he &s;hould be able to ob|tain me: I li&s;tened attentively to all he &s;aid, and endeavoured to per&s;uade my&s;elf that I did not di&s;|tinctly hear; but how was it po&s;&s;ible to doubt any longer? His voice delighted my ears, while it wounded me to the &s;oul! This hu&s;band, Celina, &s;o dear to Madame Florival, is mine; it is the too benevolent, the too unfortunate Bovile!</P>
<P>In the mean time, his deliverer was at my feet; and while he expected to entertain me with nothing but his hopes, he was forced, by my behaviour, to witne&s;s in him&s;elf the keene&s;t anxiety.</P>
<P>"Ought you," &s;aid he, "to be &s;o much a&s;to|ni&s;hed at their mutual affection, as to turn all your attention towards them? Will you not conde&s;cend to look upon me al&s;o for one moment?" Scarcely had he fini&s;hed the expre&s;&s;ion of his fears, than I gave him another cau&s;e of fear &s;till more in&s;up|portable. My &s;trength &s;uddenly for&s;ook me; and, if he had not withholden me, I &s;hould have fallen.
<PB N="45" REF="035743_0247_1006B1A881A60328">
His cries turned the attention of his &s;i&s;ter and bro|ther-in-law towards us. "Merciful God!" ex|claimed Bovile, "it is&mdash;it is the exce&s;s of her joy!"</P>
<P>For a &s;hort &s;pace I remained in that &s;ituation wherein a fainting per&s;on exerci&s;es no faculty but that of hearing. My amiable friend and her bro|ther u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible means for bringing me to my &s;en&s;es. Bovile was not le&s;s earne&s;t, nor le&s;s dili|gent than they: and while a&s;&s;i&s;ting me, he could not refrain from repeating his former exclamation, the true meaning of which was under&s;tood by none but me: "yes, it is&mdash;it is the exce&s;s of her joy!" "May I flatter my&s;elf," &s;aid his friend, "that this was the real cau&s;e?" Madame Florival affirmed, "it could be nothing el&s;e."</P>
<P>Bovile re&s;umed and &s;aid:</P>
<P>"This, then, is the young lady of whom you &s;o often &s;poke during our return!"</P>
<P>Dolerval an&s;wered, "that I was."</P>
<P>"Is her hi&s;tory &s;till unknown to you?" &s;aid Bovile. "Are you yet unacquainted with her birth and parentage?"</P>
<P>"Exactly as I told you," replied Dolerval; "but &s;he is about to make her&s;elf known; we &s;hall be united; I am waiting for my reward; and where can there be a more fortunate lover!&mdash;Be|hold her, even in this languid &s;tate, how beautiful &s;he appears!&mdash;See, &s;ee! &s;he returns to life!"</P>
<P>I began, indeed, to recover the u&s;e of my &s;en&s;es. My unfortunate benefactor, who&s;e approaching danger made him exerci&s;e his u&s;ual pre&s;ence of mind, took hold of my hand and gently tapped it with his, as if he had no other intention than pro|moting my recovery; but doubtle&s;s with a de&s;ign al&s;o of giving me to under&s;tand, by his di&s;cour&s;e,
<PB N="46" REF="035743_0248_1006B1AA8BDCF8D8">
that our critical &s;ituation required the mo&s;t &s;crupu|lous attention.</P>
<P>"Dolerval," &s;aid he, rai&s;ing his voice a little, "is it not po&s;&s;ible you may have flattered your&s;elf with a groundle&s;s hope? Since the young lady has kept &s;ecrets of this nature for &s;uch a length of time, perhaps &s;he was compelled to do it by important con&s;iderations. Are you certain that circum&s;tan|ces will now permit her to explain her&s;elf as &s;oon as you can de&s;ire?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied the young man, "I have her word for it: and what can be more &s;acred than the promi&s;es &s;he has made me?"</P>
<P>Then, unable to re&s;train my fir&s;t emotions of de|&s;pair, I cried out, "Ah, Dolerval, what have you dared to &s;ay! How dreadful is the promi&s;e I made you!"</P>
<P>And, &s;uddenly &s;truck with a &s;en&s;e of the dangers which threatened Madame Florival, in a tran&s;port of compa&s;&s;ion, I threw my&s;elf into her arms:</P>
<P>"Tremble, my deare&s;t friend," &s;aid I, "trem|ble at the thought of learning my fatal hi&s;tory&mdash;it is dreadful!&mdash;for I am not the only one, nor the mo&s;t to be pitied!"</P>
<P>Perhaps I &s;hould have continued, and perhaps betrayed my&s;elf, had not Bovile, by a penetrating and expre&s;&s;ive look, implored my &s;ilence in behalf of his wife; and I was fully &s;en&s;ible that it was nece&s;&s;ary, out of pity towards her, to hide the real cau&s;e of my di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>And now, he who&s;e tragical end I had deplored, &s;tood in my pre&s;ence. According to all appear|ances, it is evident, and more e&s;pecially according to the virtuous character of Bovile, who is incapa|ble of perfidy, that the lover of Madame Florival
<PB N="47" REF="035743_0249_1006B1B2C5FD3018">
admired her long before he was acquainted with me. When, to free me from the &s;lavery of the cloi&s;ter, he led me to the altar; the generous mor|tal not only made me the &s;acrifice of his fortune, but of his mo&s;t tender inclinations, to which the advanced age of M. Florival left &s;ome hope. O that it were in my power, thought I, to fall at his feet and te&s;tify the gratitude, re&s;pect, and admira|tion I feel for his extraordinary virtues! In what an unfortunate place, however, do I find him, and in what trying circum&s;tances! By how many wit|ne&s;&s;es I am &s;urrounded! How many dear and ter|rifying witne&s;&s;es, who will often bring me under the nece&s;&s;ity of offending or deceiving them! Ne|ver was there a woman in a &s;ituation more difficult or deplorable! If I &s;uffer the lea&s;t evidence of my re&s;pectful attachment for Bovile to be di&s;covered by my words or actions, I &s;hall give equal a&s;to|ni&s;hment and de&s;pair to the &s;i&s;ter and brother. And &s;hall I not be in danger of betraying my hu&s;band while &s;triving to keep Madame Florival in the er|ror which pre&s;erves her life? Alas! is it not al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary for me to encourage the hope of the young man; the plea&s;ing hope to which I had voluntarily yielded, and which mu&s;t never be gra|tified? But how can I calmly receive the a&s;&s;uran|ces of his affection without offending my hu&s;band, who is pre&s;ent to hear them?</P>
<P>My hu&s;band, do I &s;ay? He cannot be mine and at the &s;ame time that of Madame Florival. He has probably lo&s;t all right to Emilia, whom he will doubtle&s;s renounce! and yet this Emilia would be criminal if &s;he &s;hould &s;ecretly entertain an af|fection for another. O Dolerval, Dolerval! our union will be impo&s;&s;ible forever!</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="035743_0250_1006B1B6F8D116F8">So many, and &s;uch painful thoughts do not tor|ment me without being manife&s;ted from time to time by external &s;igns, which are di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to my lover. I endeavour to comfort him by a kind de|ception. I tell him&mdash;yes, I can &s;afely tell him, that he mu&s;t not impute my anxiety to any thing but the painful &s;truggles which I mu&s;t naturally ex|perience, when I behold the moment approaching in which I mu&s;t reveal all the horrors of my de&s;|tiny. But Bovile, in this re&s;pect, more unfortu|nate than I, could have no rea&s;onable pretext for his melancholy. His melancholy, do I &s;ay? It is nece&s;&s;ary for him to affect tran&s;ports of joy, while he is tortured with keen di&s;quietude, and, appa|rently, in the agonies of de&s;pair. He &s;eems, at &s;ome intervals, to be wanting in the courage re|qui&s;ite for his trying &s;ituation; his voice and coun|tenance often change in an equal degree, and he often &s;eems to be affected with gloomy reveries. At fir&s;t his wife appeared to feel no other emotion but of tender &s;olicitude for his welfare.</P>
<P>"Have a little courage and patience my dear," cried &s;he; "&s;ince they have re&s;tored you to liberty, they will doubtle&s;s re&s;tore you to honor."</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding all &s;he can &s;ay, and what|ever efforts he makes to &s;eem cheerful, &s;he &s;oon beholds him again in the &s;ame pen&s;ive mood as be|fore. Then &s;he becomes anxious and afflicted for her&s;elf: "Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, "are you now more unhappy than when you returned from Cadiz; or have I become le&s;s dear to you than formerly?"</P>
<P>"Ah!" replied he, "if it was po&s;&s;ible not to love you at all, my lot would, perhaps, appear le&s;s &mdash;; perhaps it would appear more &s;upportable."</P>
<P>Madame Florival was &s;till more alarmed by this
<PB N="49" REF="035743_0251_1006B1C1678CFC18">
reply, which her hu&s;band refu&s;ed to explain, and which I could ea&s;ily under&s;tand.</P>
<P>What more, my &s;i&s;ter, &s;hall I tell you concern|ing this evening; one of the mo&s;t trying I have ex|perienced during my life? Bovile &s;eemed to de&s;ire an opportunity of &s;peaking with me in private; and I was de&s;irous of obtaining his coun&s;els and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in this critical &s;ituation; but there were no means of obtaining them: for Madame Florival, &s;ometimes calm, and &s;ometimes agitated; now con|tented, and then grieved, had not left her hu&s;band for a moment: And, on the other hand, the young man, continually &s;eated near me, at fir&s;t infatuated with flattering hopes, &s;eemed now to regard me with increa&s;ing anxiety. Has my refu&s;al to make the expected explanations given him more lively chagrin, or has he artfully taken it upon him to appear anxious and offended, in order to compel me to a di&s;clo&s;ure of my &s;ecrets? All I can tell you is, that he urged me, with great ardour, to make my&s;elf known. But it was with a tone of voice which wounded true love, by a &s;trange di&s;|tru&s;t, which, methinks, would never take place if true love is founded entirely upon e&s;teem. And ju&s;t now, as I was about to retire, he &s;aid, with great force of expre&s;&s;ion, "Why &s;hould it &s;eem painful to you to make tho&s;e declarations which you &s;till deny me and continually defer? Calum|niated and per&s;ecuted innocence no longer appears intere&s;ting; we ought never to blu&s;h at our mi&s;|fortunes; there is nothing but vice which can in|cur di&s;grace. Indeed, if I could believe for one moment, that vice had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the incredible power of &s;ullying, in the lea&s;t degree, the purity of your mind, I &s;hould ever afterwards de&s;pair of finding true virtue."</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="035743_0252_1006B1C88B969550">The&s;e &s;u&s;picions, which he &s;o poorly di&s;gui&s;ed, were rewarded by my &s;ilence. And now, my &s;i&s;ter, I have returned to my apartment, where I &s;hall no longer expect to find repo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXXXI. Emilia in continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>December 8, 1782,
6 o'clock evening.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS morning I could not refu&s;e my attend|ance at breakfa&s;t. Madame Florival was far from appearing tranquil; Bovile had an air of pen&s;ive melancholy, and M. Dolerval &s;oon re|newed his &s;olicitations with an ardour which greatly affected me. For all his behaviour was attended with a re&s;pectful delicacy, which, from what I heard from him la&s;t evening, was quite unexpect|ed. It was, however, to view it in its true light, an additional affliction to your unfortunate &s;i&s;ter. What a culpable propen&s;ity is this, which makes me derive &s;atisfaction from the re&s;pectful love of this young man, whom I am compelled to deceive by fal&s;e promi&s;es! And how cruel it is to continue in plea&s;ing him whom I am not permitted to love! It &s;eemed, in my de&s;peration, that I &s;hould end in making my&s;elf known, when Bovile, apparently de&s;igning to fortify my mind with different re&s;olu|tions, turned to Madame Florival, and &s;aid, "As we are agreed in it, I will now give your amiable friend a relation of my fatal adventures as far as &s;he is unacquainted."</P>
<P>Then he informed me that "his name was Bo|vile;
<PB N="51" REF="035743_0253_1006B1C352ABA1F0">
that in the latter part of the year 1775, he, for the fir&s;t time, &s;aw Mademoi&s;elle de Sancerre, now Madame Florival, and no &s;ooner beheld than he admired her; and when he found it was not in his power to obtain her, in order to le&s;&s;en the weight of his misfortunes, he followed the &s;eas; that M. de Varmont, a celebrated naviga|tor, had advanced him, placed him in the royal navy, and &s;upported him there; after the death of his benefactor he went to Paris, where he &s;aw the younge&s;t daughter of his friend, whom he married, to prevent her from being impri&s;oned in a convent."</P>
<P>In this place, Celina, I could not re&s;i&s;t my de|&s;ire of interrupting his rapid recital.</P>
<P>"Ah! Mon&s;ieur, how much e&s;teem and grati|tude are due to you from that young woman!"</P>
<P>"She is no more," cried he!</P>
<P>"Is &s;he no more? Alas! it mu&s;t be &s;o, &s;ince you have married this lady."</P>
<P>Then he related how "his Emilia had peri&s;hed in a &s;hip which was de&s;troyed by fire; how, in a few days afterwards, his perfidious companions in arms, for&s;ook him near the I&s;lands of the Azores, in a naval engagement with the Engli&s;h. My fri|gate," continued he, "was &s;unk; I &s;wam upon the wide world of waters, but did not de&s;pair. Fortune &s;econded my &s;truggles, and at length I was &s;aved by getting upon a rock. During three days I was &s;upported by the &s;hell-fi&s;h and herbs which grew thereon. About noon, on the fourth day, I was kindly taken on board a Spani&s;h &s;hip, bound from Terceira to Cadiz. Too well acquainted with the inju&s;tice of mankind, who are always in|clined to condemn the unfortunate, I a&s;&s;umed a fal&s;e name. At this time, heaven &s;eemed ready to reward me for my former rever&s;es of fortune. Soon
<PB N="52" REF="035743_0254_1006B1D362D0D780">
after landing at Cadiz, I received a letter from Do|lerval, which informed me that his &s;i&s;ter, having lo&s;t her hu&s;band, was at liberty. It was not long before I found means of returning to France, and, without delay, I came to this hou&s;e for an a&s;ylum, and the recompence of my hard fortune. In the mean time, how could I obtain it? How contract a &s;econd marriage? Although there was a natural certainty in the death of Emilia, it could not be proved by any legal evidence; and, in &s;uch ca&s;es, our laws oblige a &s;urviving hu&s;band to live &s;ingle. I propo&s;ed a mean of &s;ecuring my happine&s;s, which I believed would injure no per&s;on in the world; a mean which &s;eemed to bring no inconvenience with it. This propo&s;al &s;eemed, in the opinion of Madame Florival, the mo&s;t advi&s;eable. We went with confidence to the altar, and I was married by the fal&s;e name which my unfavourable circum|&s;tances obliged me to a&s;&s;ume. It was on the night of &mdash;." "The 7th of Augu&s;t," interrupted I! "I &s;hall long remember that night!&mdash;for my friend has often repeated the date."</P>
<P>"I acknowledge it," an&s;wered Madame Flori|val, pre&s;&s;ing my hand in her own; "I acknow|ledge that I have often recollected that night with a mixture of plea&s;ure and pain. You &s;ee how dangerous it is for per&s;ons to compound with their duty; at that aera, for the fir&s;t time in my life, I pre&s;umed to do it, and now I am puni&s;hed for it in a mo&s;t unfortunate union. A continual fear empoi&s;ons all its enjoyments; and though my fear &s;eems without foundation, yet it ince&s;&s;antly revives in my mind. Alas! this, perhaps, is a fore&s;ight!"</P>
<P>"Methinks I under&s;tand you," interrupted I; "you tremble le&s;t his fir&s;t wife, &s;aved by &s;ome miracle, may one day come again, and &mdash;."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="035743_0255_1006B1DD280E8828">"I &s;hould certainly die," cried &s;he pitifully.</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible," &s;aid her brother, with a per|&s;ua&s;ive and con&s;oling voice."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid Bovile, regarding me with a look of &s;upplication.</P>
<P>And I al&s;o, Celina, moved with terror and pity, &s;aid, "It is impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>Bovile, much encouraged by this conver&s;ation, continued, "The&s;e were, and &s;till are, my inten|tions. As &s;oon as more favourable circum&s;tances would permit me to reque&s;t a review of the iniqui|tous pro&s;ecution which di&s;graced my memory, I determined to appear in the pre&s;ence of my ene|mies, and let them know I was &s;till living. After this, I determined, without delay, to re&s;ort to my mi&s;tre&s;s, and marry her by my a&s;&s;umed name; by which I purpo&s;ed to go into &s;ome ob&s;cure village, and &s;pend my days with her there. But we had not been united more than five days before a re|port was circulated that M. de * * * *, mini&s;ter of the marine, my per&s;onal enemy, had been di&s;|placed for an intrigue. I ha&s;tened to Paris, but found, on my arrival, it was a fal&s;e report. I can|not tell what ba&s;e courti&s;an of my powerful ene|my informed him of my exi&s;tence and arrival at the capital&mdash;but, in the mid&s;t of the night follow|ing, I was dragged away from my lodgings, and plunged into the gulph of mini&s;terial vengeance. You are acquainted," continued he, "with the re&s;t, excepting that my wife is now entering the fifth month of her pregnancy."</P>
<P>The la&s;t words of Bovile gave much &s;atisfaction to M. Dolerval. "Now," &s;aid he to his &s;i&s;ter, "your ties have, if po&s;&s;ible, become more &s;acred and dear."</P>
<P>Well might he &s;ay more &s;acred and dear! And
<PB N="54" REF="035743_0256_1006B1DFB4CA01F0">
it is evident that Bovile mentioned this circum|&s;tance to convince me, that out of pity to a mother as well as a wife, I ought to &s;pread a religious veil over my fearful &s;tory. Of this he may be a&s;&s;ured! However painful to me it may often appear, I &s;hall be &s;ilent; to the urgent entreaties of this young man, I &s;hall turn a deaf ear; I &s;hall reject his earne&s;t &s;olicitations; &s;upport the weight of his reproaches, and, without being overcome, I &s;hall behold his tears flow, and, in appearance, witne&s;s his de&s;pair with calm fortitude: happy &s;hall I be to pre&s;erve (even at the expence of his happine&s;s and mine) the life of his &s;i&s;ter, who is not only my friend, but an unfortunate mother, and the wife of my benefactor.</P>
<P>M. Dolerval, however, who cannot imagine how much I am to be pitied, if it was po&s;&s;ible for me to declare it, &s;till accu&s;es me of egoti&s;m, cruelty and in&s;en&s;ibility. "Be&s;ides," &s;ays he continually, "you have promi&s;ed me." And Madame Florival joins her brother in trying to per&s;uade me to a ful|filment of my engagements. O thoughtle&s;s and unhappy woman! let her tremble le&s;t I &s;hould not always have &s;ufficient fortitude to keep tho&s;e &s;e|crets &s;he urges me to reveal!</P>
<P>And now the unkind young man abu&s;es me again. He repeats tho&s;e cruel expre&s;&s;ions which &s;o afflicted and offended me la&s;t evening: "<HI>Per|&s;ecuted innocence appears more intere&s;ting than before.</HI> Do you under&s;tand me, young woman, or do you determine not to under&s;tand?" Then he continued and &s;aid, "<HI>We ought never to blu&s;h at our misfortunes: there is nothing but vice which can incur di&s;grace.</HI>"</P>
<P>Fortunately he &s;topped here. Fortunately he did me &s;o much ju&s;tice, or &s;till entertained &s;o much
<PB N="55" REF="035743_0257_1006B1E5E540A6D0">
re&s;pect for my character, as not to make again the la&s;t and &s;evere&s;t reflection which I remember to have heard ye&s;terday evening with too little impa|tience."</P>
<P>But what can be the meaning of tho&s;e words, which he plea&s;es to repeat when I have wearied his per&s;evering importunity, and which he repeats with a &s;ort of my&s;terious affectation; in which, methinks, I perceive a &s;trange mixture of threaten|ings and fear, confidence and jealous inquietude, pre&s;umption and re&s;pect? What can be his mean|ing? I determine to know before long. Perhaps M. Dolerval will conde&s;cend to explain him&s;elf more clearly!</P>
<P>To continue; I have ju&s;t had a very tender and trying interview with Bovile. He &s;uppo&s;ed he had found a favourable moment to warn me, with a low voice, that he was going to wait for me in the garden, and thought he &s;hould not be perceived. Yet I cannot but tremble le&s;t his wife might have remarked our whi&s;pering: although &s;he was look|ing another way, &s;he had her eyes fixed upon the gla&s;s, and in an emotion of &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he looked round, and &s;eemed, with difficulty, to &s;uppre&s;s her anxiety. Out of prudence, I thought be&s;t to wait almo&s;t half an hour, and fearing Bovile might be out of patience, I made a pretence of retiring to my apartment, where you may &s;uppo&s;e I did not make a long &s;tay.</P>
<P>He began the conver&s;ation by acknowledging and a&s;king pardon for the crime he conceived him|&s;elf guilty of towards his fir&s;t wife; then, by the tender commi&s;eration natural to benevolent minds, he conjured me to leave Madame Florival in the error, which alone could &s;ecure the mother and child from certain death. Afterwards, without
<PB N="56" REF="035743_0258_1006B1E9A85F8688">
giving me any &s;urpri&s;e, but &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment, he prote&s;ted, in a very re&s;pectful and obliging man|ner, that I ought to feel perfectly ea&s;y on his ac|count, becau&s;e the pre&s;ent hu&s;band of Eleanor had lo&s;t all right to Emilia: and I could not but blu&s;h exceedingly when he told me I was to be pitied in being &s;till under the nece&s;&s;ity of encouraging the love of the young man, who was, in the highe&s;t degree, amiable. Then he de&s;ired me to inform him by what &s;eries of wonderful events, I was &s;aved at Bre&s;t and conducted to Tours. I briefly informed him, my dear Celina, of every important circum&s;tance, except the crimes of that mon&s;ter of whom I could now be ea&s;ily avenged, and for who&s;e repentance I daily implore the boundle&s;s mercy of a &s;in-pardoning God.</P>
<P>Bovile, all attentive to the relation of my &s;tory, remarked with fear, "that Murville, being the friend of Varmont, would occa&s;ion Madame Flo|rival to be in continual danger of di&s;covering my name and hi&s;tory: and Murville," added he, "is perhaps, a wor&s;e &s;ubject than you are aware of; for (permit me to tell it you) your brother can|not but &s;trangely corrupt all tho&s;e who keep his company."</P>
<P>He was going to a&s;k me but one que&s;tion more, for we de&s;ired more than any thing el&s;e, to confer on the mo&s;t advi&s;eable mea&s;ures for warding off the dangers which threatened Eleanor; but Bovile ob&s;erved his brother-in-law coming directly after us, and we were obliged to change the conver&s;a|tion. After joining us, M. Dolerval acco&s;ted us with congratulations on the great courage we were favoured with, which enabled us, notwith&s;tanding the winds and cold air, to continue our walk &s;o long; and when we returned to the hou&s;e, Ma|dame
<PB N="57" REF="035743_0259_1006B1F3FB769860">
Florival ironically told me, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed I was all this time in my apartment.</P>
<P>In order to &s;upport, during the remainder of the evening, the de&s;perate &s;pectacle of the ill-di&s;gui&s;ed chagrin of the &s;i&s;ter and brother, it was incumbent on me to exerci&s;e complete &s;elf-government. Pity me, O Celina, pity me! for the portion of evils allotted me is already more than I can bear! But if this did not excite your &s;urpri&s;e, you would only need, in order to have it excited, to con&s;ider, for one moment, the &s;ituation of your &s;i&s;ter, in all its aggravating circum&s;tances, whil&s;t &s;urrounded with the deare&s;t objects of her affection. The portion of &s;orrow, which every day becomes more in&s;up|portable, and which I am nece&s;&s;itated to di&s;tribute to each of them, mu&s;t, ere long, become intoler|ably &s;evere. And yet they, together, will have to &s;upport but the lighte&s;t part of the burden, whil&s;t the feeble Emilia is the object on whom its enor|mous weight mu&s;t fall. O! what would become of me, if, whil&s;t I am continually obliged to exer|ci&s;e di&s;&s;imulation to hide from them my burden|&s;ome reflections or di&s;tractive anxiety; what, I &s;ay, would become of me, if I were not favoured with the privilege of communication with you, to give you the complete hi&s;tory of my misfortunes?</P>

<P>HOW afflicting it is to give pain to per&s;ons whom we e&s;teem and tenderly love! and how cruel to endure their di&s;plea&s;ure! Madame Florival already begins to dimini&s;h her affection for Juliette, whom lately &s;he held &s;o dear; and I believe the unkind Dolerval will end in hating me.</P>
<P>In his moments of impatience, which are more frequent than they were formerly, he continues to repeat tho&s;e phra&s;es which he has often &s;aid before, and which &s;till &s;eem inigmatical; and you cannot conceive to what degree I am wearied with his un|ju&s;t behaviour. You cannot imagine what I en|dure when he pur&s;ues Juliette and his friend with inqui&s;itive glances of jealou&s;y! And if, in an in|&s;tant afterwards, he turns away from us to hide the tears which overflow his face, then how much &s;everer are my trials, how much greater is my un|happine&s;s!</P>
<P>And when I behold the intere&s;ting Madame Flo|rival, &s;o mild and &s;o timid in the jealous agitations of her mind, ca&s;t her anxious eyes, by &s;tealth, up|on Bovile and me, what hinders me from flying to her arms, and, for an immediate ju&s;tification of my conduct, pre&s;&s;ing her to my bo&s;om, and making my&s;elf known? What hinders me from it, if it be not the dreadful certainty that I cannot comfort her as a lover and friend, without throwing her into de&s;pair as a mother and wife?</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="035743_0261_1006B1FCF1C98778">What mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es both of them is my fre|quent walks with Bovile. But we &s;hould not &s;o often walk into the garden, or rather we &s;hould &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o walk there at all, if they only had patience &s;ometimes to leave us there undi&s;turbed. Whenever Bovile and I, after &s;everal vain attempts, have &s;ucceeded in e&s;caping and meeting there, M. Dolerval immediately follows. Ye&s;terday, as in the evening before, he acco&s;ted us with ironical eulogies, on our invincible courage, which enabled us to endure the intemperature of the air. To-day it is quite otherwi&s;e; for we &s;everal times &s;urpri&s;ed him, to appearance, li&s;tening to what we &s;aid. From the moment he perceives us, he pur&s;ues; but he regulates his &s;teps in &s;uch a manner, that we keep before him; and when he draws near, he ad|vances with &s;lower &s;teps and without noi&s;e. In this &s;ituation he is obliged to join us; for, whenever he approaches near, we &s;lacken our pace without affectation. Thus forced to come up with us, he does it, but without &s;peaking a &s;ingle word. He appears to be afraid he &s;hall not govern his expre&s;|&s;ions as he ought; he only keeps at my &s;ide, regu|lates his &s;teps according to ours, and, in this man|ner, continues to accompany us until he has con|&s;trained us to return to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This evening, however, they have left us toge|ther almo&s;t an hour, and we have come to an im|portant re&s;olution. The re&s;olution nece&s;&s;ary for me to take is very painful, and more &s;o than I dared to acknowledge to Bovile. He has con|&s;ented, by my per&s;ua&s;ions, whenever an opportu|nity offers, to conduct me to whatever convent he &s;hall think mo&s;t eligible. This I have done for the repo&s;e of his Eleanor, and, perhaps, it may be for that of the young man; but never will it prove
<PB N="60" REF="035743_0262_1006B20379459B18">
conducive to my own! At fir&s;t I was not with|out hopes, that by taking &s;uitable precaution, I might retire, &s;afely and undi&s;covered, to your con|vent; but Bovile, in a lively and affectionate man|ner, repre&s;ented the many accidents which might, at &s;ome time or other, di&s;cover my retreat to that place. And when he brought to my remembrance the hatred which Madame de Varmont &s;till bears me, I felt within me an inexpre&s;&s;ible horror, on reflecting upon the &s;till greater dangers to which I might be expo&s;ed by the cruelty of her &s;on. What, my dear Celina, can now &s;upport me? For now I am bereft, even of the mi&s;erable con&s;olation of hoping to die in your cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>This preliminary being agreed on, we had no|thing more urgent to do than returning to the hou&s;e. I was a&s;toni&s;hed to think the young man had not pur&s;ued and di&s;turbed us in our &s;ad deliberations. The brother and &s;i&s;ter al&s;o, it appeared, had &s;ome &s;ecret and di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act between them&s;elves. When we made our appearance, they ha&s;tily concealed &s;ome letters they were reading, and their countenances were covered with confu|&s;ion: M. Dolerval &s;eemed to be more di&s;turbed than his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this evening they have had &s;e|veral lengthy and my&s;terious conferences. Juliette, we made no doubt, was the unfortunate &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation. When they &s;poke to each other, it was in a low voice; and they &s;ometimes turned their eyes towards me in &s;uch a manner as gave me much alarm. At &s;upper the young man made &s;everal uncommon and painful efforts to ad|dre&s;s me; while his &s;i&s;ter, in deep contemplation, &s;carcely &s;eemed to perceive me. It is all over with me! I have lo&s;t their affection. Although I can
<PB N="61" REF="035743_0263_1006B20514D69840">
ea&s;ily pardon Madame Florival, while my heart is affected with relenting pity; yet, as for you, un|kind Dolerval, your conduct is unpardonable.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, my &s;i&s;ter, that the injuries they do me will render the approaching &s;eparation le&s;s trying. No, do not believe it. This departure will be followed by an eternal ab&s;ence! This un|happy &s;eparation will &s;horten the period of my life. Ah! &s;o much the better, &s;o much the better, if I can thereby &s;horten the term of my &s;ufferings! But my own &s;ufferings are not the moving cau&s;e of my re&s;olutions. My highe&s;t motive in retiring, is the giving a little repo&s;e to the&s;e unkind per&s;ons who are continually mi&s;erable by my re&s;idence with them, and who, in&s;tructed, perhaps too late, of my generous attachment for them, may follow me to weep over my untimely grave.</P>

<P>THROUGH what a &s;cene I have pa&s;t! Oh, Celina! how I rejoice to think it will re|quire but a few more &s;o cruel as this to procure me the peaceful &s;olitude of the tomb!</P>
<P>This morning Madame Florival received me with all the te&s;timonies of friend&s;hip to which I have been accu&s;tomed at any time before. And, to my &s;urpri&s;e, early as it was, I found M. Do|lerval in her apartment. He was walking ha&s;tily
<PB N="62" REF="035743_0264_1006B20E62C411F8">
about the room in a thoughtful and unea&s;y mood, and, after pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t compliments, he &s;eemed in ha&s;te to look after &s;ome letters in his pocket-book, but his &s;i&s;ter checked him and &s;aid, "One moment, my brother! let us do nothing precipi|tately; your friend will come down immediately."</P>
<P>Her hu&s;band, indeed, at the &s;ame time entered the room: then &s;eating her&s;elf between M. Doler|val and me, &s;he addre&s;&s;es him as follows: "My dear, we have been waiting for you. Will you be &s;o obliging as to take a &s;eat and hear me one moment without interrupting me; and let every one pre&s;ent do me the &s;ame favour.</P>
<P>"By what &s;trange fatality has it happened that the period of your return, &s;o much de&s;ired by your lover and your friend, the happy period which &s;hould have terminated all their &s;orrows&mdash;how has it happened unto the pre&s;ent moment that it has in|volved them in the deepe&s;t perplexity? It is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to know the cau&s;e of our mi&s;|fortunes, whatever it may be. I do not pre&s;ume to &s;ay it will be alike po&s;&s;ible to every one to en|dure, much longer, the &s;ituation which we find is more or le&s;s painful to us all. And &s;ince an elu|cidation will &s;ooner or later be ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen|&s;ible, I hope you will conde&s;cend to make it with the &s;ame readine&s;s and freedom with which I am about to exact it.</P>
<P>"It &s;eems natural to &s;uppo&s;e, Juliette, that by a mo&s;t tender affection for you, my brother has merited the preference of being acquainted with the impenetrable my&s;tery of your misfortunes. Whe|ther you have favoured my more fortunate hu&s;|band with a relation of them, or why you have done &s;o, I do not inquire. For the intere&s;t of us all, I limit my&s;elf to requiring you to let every
<PB N="63" REF="035743_0265_1006B2198C6BC770">
one become acquainted with your &s;ecrets. It is a favour which I reque&s;t in the name of my hu&s;band, who cannot long enjoy any happine&s;s at home, while he beholds his wife and his friend in perpe|tual anxiety. It is an act of ju&s;tice, which I claim in behalf of my brother, who loves you, and, as you doubtle&s;s de&s;erve, with the greate&s;t ardour and ten|derne&s;s; but who, by your frequent and my&s;teri|ous conver&s;ations with Bovile, is driven to de&s;pair. I conjure you to do it for my &s;ake al&s;o," continu|ed &s;he, taking hold of my hand, which &s;he pre&s;&s;ed in her own with tenderne&s;s, "who do not wi&s;h to hide it from you any longer, that I am a little jealous of you. In &s;hort, young woman, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on your doing it for your own &s;ake, for your reputation, for a vindication of your virtue, which the darke&s;t calumnies have dared to pur&s;ue, even to the bo&s;om of the mo&s;t faithful friend&s;hip and mo&s;t re&s;pectful love.</P>
<P>"Show her tho&s;e two letters, my brother. He received them," addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to me, "the fifth of this month, ju&s;t before leaving Paris to return home."</P>
<P>"I did not believe one word they contained," cried M. Dolerval, "not one word."</P>
<P>"In the fir&s;t place," re&s;umed Madame Florival, "permit me to accu&s;e you of extreme di&s;&s;imulation. Often have I had occa&s;ion to &s;peak about his elder brother, Murville, and you have never given me the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect you of having been ac|quainted with him&mdash;I under&s;tand your &s;ilence, Ju|liette; the author of this &s;econd letter al&s;o, M. de Varmont, could you, for your misfortune, have&mdash;?"</P>
<P>I heard no more, my &s;i&s;ter, for at the name of Varmont, pronounced by Madame Florival, I fainted.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="035743_0266_1006B21B915DDCA0">When I recovered my &s;en&s;es, I &s;aw her in great di&s;tre&s;s, her brother all in tears, and Bovile pale with terror.</P>
<P>"She knows him, indeed," &s;aid M. Dolerval.</P>
<P>"How," &s;aid Madame Florival, "could the mentioning this young man's name, or the mere &s;ight of a letter written by his hand, &s;o much af|frighten her?"</P>
<P>And Bovile, with a trembling voice, tried in vain to get permi&s;&s;ion for a peru&s;al of the letters which occa&s;ioned my terror.</P>
<P>"Read them, my friend," &s;aid I to Madame Florival, "read them. I tremble, it is true, but not for my&s;elf."</P>
<P>M. Dolerval, actuated with pity towards me, put back the letters into his pocket-book. But I told both him and his &s;i&s;ter they mu&s;t no longer keep any thing from me. After urging them for permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee the&s;e letters, and making many entreaties, Madame Florival de&s;ired her brother to give them to me. I read them, my &s;i&s;ter, and was better able to read them through than I expected! But, at pre&s;ent, Celina, my &s;ight is ob&s;cured by my tears, and my hand trembles to &s;uch a degree, that I cannot relate the conclu&s;ion of this dreadful &s;cene: And, before I relate it, I determine to &s;end you a copy of the&s;e letters: afterwards I will tell you what commentaries were made upon them, by what means they remained in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and what I intend to do with them.</P>

<P>YOU have much ingenuity, my brother; you prove your&s;elf to be a man of talents. The picture you &s;ent me in miniature is &s;o much like the original, I was almo&s;t di&s;tracted with joy and a&s;toni&s;hment. Since you can paint her &s;o com|pletely from memory, you mu&s;t have known her features perfectly well: but it is fortunate for you that I know her much better than your&s;elf. That &s;he is very engaging I cannot deny: but if we may give credit to all that Varmont has told me, &s;he is, with all her attractions, but a little mon|&s;ter! I am not, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the entire dupe of my friend. There &s;eems to be in his writings, a &s;ort of amorous &s;pite, which he endeavours, in vain, to di&s;gui&s;e; we may, however, conclude, that if he has not told &s;ome dark fal&s;ehoods, he has, at lea&s;t, exaggerated &s;ome ugly truths. And, reducing every circum&s;tance to its true and mi&s;erable value, my poor Dolerval, it appears little &s;hort of down|right certainty, that your intended is no more than a fortune-huntre&s;s. Could I be &s;atisfied you only meant to addre&s;s her for no other purpo&s;e than a little amu&s;ement, it would be well; and in &s;uch ca&s;e, I would con&s;ent to give up my right: but, to marry her! I would lo&s;e my life before I would con&s;ent to it. And, believe me, there are no mea|&s;ures which I will not try to di&s;engage you from your undertaking.</P>

<P>MY friend, I have no re&s;entment again&s;t you at all. The rea&s;on I did not write, was becau&s;e &s;ome mi&s;erable affairs of intere&s;t have given me no time. My younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, who was lately married, is dead; and you are acquainted with the honorable end of Bovile, who&s;e goods they have confi&s;cated. The dowry of his wife, however, is well worth the pains of a &s;uit for re|covering it, and this occa&s;ions me to be &s;urrounded with lawyers, who put me out of my wits. You may tell me, they doubtle&s;s give me &s;ome lei&s;ure; very little, I a&s;&s;ure you, and that little, I mu&s;t own, is well &s;pent in the company of a very good girl, who treats me with great kindne&s;s. You will, therefore, excu&s;e me for having preferred love to friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="035743_0269_1006B228739BA3B0">As to the little girl you mentioned, I have, for a long time, thought no more of her than if I had never known her; and was almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed to learn &s;he was yet in being. But, what is &s;tranger than all the re&s;t, it &s;eems &s;he has fallen into other hands than yours. But Lafleur, of whom I have ju&s;t been inquiring, tells me &s;he was poorly guard|ed in your ca&s;tle, and &s;ince I know &s;he has great &s;kill in running away, I am not much &s;urpri&s;ed. Recollecting that I promi&s;ed you her hi&s;tory, I will now give you an abridgment of it. The dear girl was &s;old to me in this place, by a &s;ort of mother, who guaranteed the premi&s;es. But I found I had been a dupe in the market. And how great was my &s;tupidity! By her continual entreaties I was per&s;uaded to take her to Bre&s;t. She told me &s;he wi&s;hed to go there to take leave of a brother, who, &s;he &s;aid, was going away in the fleet. This pre|tended brother was a &s;coundrel whom &s;he loved. In the mid&s;t of a clear night, and at a time when I lea&s;t expected it, the amiable girl, prudently &s;eized with &s;ome of my be&s;t effects, &s;oftly opened the door, and made her e&s;cape. But my valet, who is ea&s;ily awaked, pur&s;ued the fugitive, and being ready to overtake her at the port, &s;he got out of her &s;en&s;es, and jumped into the &s;ea. From thence, by &s;ome &s;trange providence, &s;he was taken and put into your hands. You may, for your&s;elf, Murville, do what you plea&s;e; but I promi&s;e, for your &s;ake, to let her alone. You will torment your&s;elf, I &s;uppo&s;e, by going after her again; but, believe me, &s;he is not worth that trouble.</P>
<P>However, if you have any regard for the poor man who is &s;o bewitched after her, you cannot take too ha&s;ty, I &s;hould &s;ay too violent mea&s;ures, to hinder him from a marriage, which would, at
<PB N="68" REF="035743_0270_1006B235522FCAD0">
once, bring him to di&s;grace, and, &s;ooner or later, to mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>To conclude; my dear Murville, whatever part you may take, I &s;hall not feel intere&s;ted in it, ex|cept on your account. O that you may forget her your&s;elf, as I de&s;ire &s;he may forget me! But I hope the fooli&s;h individual who warranted this girl to me, and thereby robbed me of my money, will &s;oon have rea&s;on to repent of it. If you love her now, I cannot but pity you; and if your friend marries her, I &s;hall pity him &s;till more.</P>

<P>CONSIDER, my Celina, how greatly I mu&s;t have been confounded by tho&s;e in&s;ulting let|ters in the pre&s;ence of this young man, who was di&s;mayed with jealous love and fear; in the pre|&s;ence of the young man who could not, but with difficulty, refrain from entertaining the mo&s;t inju|rious &s;u&s;picions again&s;t the object of his love. When I began to read them, I trembled for his &s;i&s;ter. But as &s;oon as I di&s;covered the nature of tho&s;e odious fal&s;ehoods which Varmont, ingenious in villainy, had invented to ruin me; as &s;oon as I perceived that tho&s;e atrocious calumnies would only &s;erve to cover the eyes of Madame Florival with a thicker bandage than before, and had rea&s;on to be|lieve my new in&s;ults would be the &s;alvation of my friend, my courage in &s;ome mea&s;ure revived. With
<PB N="69" REF="035743_0271_1006B23C227BAEB8">
a voice le&s;s faltering, I was enabled to continue until I had fini&s;hed reading them. And Bovile, who, in the angui&s;h of horrible expectation, was, at fir&s;t, alarmed for the fate of his wife, &s;oon after|wards felt equal apprehen&s;ions for mine.</P>
<P>The lengthy commentaries to which the in&s;olent expre&s;&s;ions of Murville gave place, &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence; but, unfortunately, &s;ome of the re|marks made on the calumnies of Varmont merit a repetition.</P>
<P>At the following pa&s;&s;age in the letter of Var|mont, "You are acquainted with the honorable end of Bovile, who&s;e goods they have confi&s;cated," "In&s;olent mon&s;ter!" cried the hu&s;band of Madame Florival: "how can I take pride any longer in my fal&s;e delicacy? You &s;hall now be told what I re|pent of not having told you before: it mu&s;t have been Varmont who put me into the Ba&s;tile. Yes, every thing combines to confirm me in this opini|on! On the day of my arrival at the metropolis, I went to the hou&s;e of my infamous brother-in-law to learn, from his own mouth, whether he expected to recover &s;ix hundred thou&s;and livres which he had never paid me? The arrant knave had &s;o much pre&s;umption as to tell me to my face, I &s;hould never have given him a receipt for that &s;um unle&s;s he had paid it me. Exa&s;perated at his vil|lainy, I withdrew, and went down to an inn, to which, I &s;uppo&s;e, I was followed by one of his lacquies. Then did I learn, to my &s;orrow, the fal&s;ity of the intelligence which put me in his way. After I had found my enemy was &s;till in his place, I &s;hould have in&s;tantly departed; but being too much fatigued, and wi&s;hing to write to my wife I &s;tayed &s;everal hours. There was not one man <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="70" REF="035743_0272_1006B23DE629CE50">
the city, except Varmont, who knew of my exi&s;t|ence and arrival at Paris. You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that they informed again&s;t me the &s;ame night, &s;ince the vile bearer of the lettre-de-cachet<NOTE PLACE="foot">This was the term given to a warrant in the king's name to take and put a pri&s;oner into the Ba&s;tile.</NOTE> came and took me by &s;urpri&s;e, at four o'clock in the morn|ing."</P>
<P>Madame Florival and her brother could hardly give credit to the relation of this wicked action; whil&s;t I, my &s;i&s;ter, by certain infallible marks, could recognize Varmont in every part of the re|cital.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards I read the letter over again; and while I was reading, I interrupted my&s;elf: "Indeed," &s;aid I, ca&s;ting my eyes upon Bovile, "it is too true, that <HI>a &s;ort of mother &s;old me!</HI> But it was the mo&s;t generous of men who bought me. And how &s;hamefully has he been rewarded for it by my infamous relations! O that in &s;ome other family, he may find the happine&s;s of which mine &s;eem formed to deprive him!"</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, my &s;i&s;ter, to whom the true meaning of this di&s;cour&s;e was unknown, could not but give it a bad interpretation, for Madame Florival blu&s;hed exceedingly, and M. Dolerval was &s;truck with a&s;|toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>A few lines farther, Madame Florival a&s;ked me, with a faltering voice, "whether it was true that I was conducted to Bre&s;t?"</P>
<P>"Alas! Madame, it is true." And my an&s;wer co&s;t many &s;ighs to her brother.</P>
<P>"Is it true," &s;aid he in his turn, "that <HI>you lov|ed a per&s;on who went away in the fleet?</HI>"</P>

&s;uch a per&s;on." Hearing this, he turned pale and &s;at down: and he &s;eemed ready to fall into the un|happy &s;tate in which I had been my&s;elf.</P>
<P>A moment afterwards: "But," &s;aid Bovile with vehemence, "this is an aby&s;s of iniquity, of infa|my and ob&s;curity, in the depth of which I am lo&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Yes," cried the young man, ri&s;ing with im|petuo&s;ity, "you &s;ay rightly! An aby&s;s of iniquity, infamy and ob&s;curity! A combination of dark deeds! A weight of calumnies, which, in &s;pite of her acknowledgments, I cannot yet believe!"</P>
<P>At length I had no more to &s;ay, and Madame Florival was &s;ilent for a con&s;iderable time. Then, ca&s;ting her eyes upon me with a penetrating look, "Well," &s;aid &s;he, "I am waiting &mdash;."</P>
<P>"For what, my friend?"</P>
<P>"Your name," cried &s;he; "your &s;ecrets, your misfortunes; tho&s;e misfortunes which ju&s;tify you!"</P>
<P>"My dear friend! in order to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, I mu&s;t &s;acrifice the be&s;t of women."</P>
<P>"O Juliette, my deare&s;t Juliette! appearances, and your own confe&s;&s;ions, &s;eem to be again&s;t you: &s;peak then, I am ready to believe&mdash;."</P>
<P>"And I, O mo&s;t intere&s;ting of women! am ready to be immolated."</P>
<P>"Young woman," continued &s;he, removing her&s;elf a little from me, "you mu&s;t be willing to con&s;ider this matter. The confe&s;&s;ion which I re|que&s;t of you is indi&s;pen&s;able."</P>
<P>"Do you then in&s;i&s;t upon it, Madame? Well, give me three days longer."</P>
<P>"What! three days longer!" cried the young man, who was li&s;tening in the mo&s;t painful <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">+pen&s;e.</P>
<P>"Three days longer!" &s;aid Madame Florival&punc;</P>
<P>"Yes," replied I, "three days; and if I do

<P>"O, Juliette," replied Madame Florival, "what an alternative is this! Do you think it will be in|different to me whether you &s;tay with us or not? And look at my brother!"</P>
<P>"Take pity on my de&s;pair!" interrupted he.</P>
<P>"Your de&s;pair, Dolerval, increa&s;es my own. I mu&s;t be inflexible in my determination. But, be|fore I leave you, I beg of you to grant me one favour."</P>
<P>"Mention it," replied he, "mention it; my life, Juliette, is &s;till in your power."</P>
<P>"The more horrible tho&s;e letters are, the more nece&s;&s;ary it is that I &s;hould remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. Pray be &s;o kind as to leave them with me, and let me di&s;po&s;e of them as I think mo&s;t proper."</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid he, "what a dreadful pre&s;ent! Juliette, are you determined to leave us? Will you be &s;o hard hearted and cruel, as to leave us while we are tormented with &s;uch frightful &s;u&s;|picions&mdash;?"</P>
<P>"I cannot avoid it; they mu&s;t remain with you; but, one day, Dolerval, it will be proved, that <HI>calumniated innocence will appear more intere&s;t|ing than before.</HI>"</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, my &s;i&s;ter, I retired. I have &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened my &s;orrows by depo&s;iting them in your bo&s;om.

<P>THE horrors of my de&s;tiny, I tru&s;t, are at length completed. Attend, my &s;i&s;ter, and hear a relation of the mo&s;t calamitous events.</P>
<P>Nearly &s;ix hours ago, when, by rea&s;on of ap|proaching darkne&s;s, objects were not clearly di&s;|cernable, I was in my apartment, where I enjoy|ed the privilege of &s;ighing alone. Bovile <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> if by chance, and de&s;ired me to open the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> after I had opened it, he wi&s;hed me to &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

minutes with him in private conver&s;ation. As I trembled with fear le&s;t they &s;hould &s;ee him in my chamber, and thinking it would &s;erve to increa&s;e the jealou&s;y of his wife, I told him it was more convenient to go into the garden. According to my de&s;ire, we went thither: and as &s;oon as we were there, he addre&s;&s;ed me as follows:</P>
<P>"Your brother, I am convinced, is one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed villains. There is no doubt but it was he who &s;et fire to the Centaure him&s;elf, or that it was done by his orders."</P>
<P>Upon this, I endeavoured to make him believe that Varmont was incapable of &s;uch villainy.</P>
<P>"No, no," &s;aid Bovile, "your genero&s;ity &s;hall deceive me no longer. The truth &s;hines clearly into my eyes, and I am certain it is equally vi&s;ible to yours. And I tremble, my dear Emilia, le&s;t it may enlighten others al&s;o. This morning, in your grief and confu&s;ion, you &s;aid too much upon the &s;ubject. My wife is now reflecting upon what you &s;aid, conjecturing, and uniting a number of promi&s;cuous circum&s;tances, and comparing them with your irreproachable conduct and equivocal an&s;wers. She derives from your confe&s;&s;ions, al|though ob&s;cure, &s;ome inferences, which, together with Varmont's letter, may probably a&s;&s;i&s;t her to unfold the frightful my&s;tery of your misfortunes. But a few minutes ago, as &s;he was walking pen|&s;ively about the room, &s;he &s;topped &s;hort and &s;aid, "<HI>Her mother &s;old her&mdash;A generous man bought her&mdash;To Bre&s;t this generous man conducted her &mdash;It &s;eems that &s;he fell into the &s;ea.</HI>" And the unfortunate woman, immediately afterwards, a&s;ked <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> terrible que&s;tion: "<HI>What was the age of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">oi&s;elle de Varmont when you married</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> O, Emilia, fair and generous Emilia, I

fear the dreadful di&s;covery is at hand! Let us double our caution to avoid it for a longer period."</P>
<P>"Hold!" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"Why?" an&s;wered he.</P>
<P>"Don't you &s;ee the young man behind us&mdash; Dolerval, who is coming after us&mdash;who li&s;tens and watches every motion?"</P>
<P>"One word only," replied he with a low voice, "let us walk &s;everal minutes longer, &s;o as to have no appearance of affectation. Afterwards, retire to your chamber and &s;hut the door, and if Madame Florival knocks, do not open it. About midnight I &s;hall come to take you away. I will conduct you, too unfortunate Emilia, to the &s;olitude of the cloi&s;ter, from which &s;olitude I relea&s;ed you but to make you more wretched."</P>
<P>"Peace, then!" &s;aid I, "he draws near."</P>
<P>"Well! let us change our conver&s;ation," re|plied Bovile.</P>
<P>"Yes, let us &s;peak of the apprehen&s;ions I have from Murville; even in pre&s;ence of Dolerval I can &s;peak of his brother without any danger or incon|venience."</P>
<P>The young man then drew near, but, as u&s;ual, without offering a word. He only walked at my &s;ide and kept pace with us, as I have told you he has frequently done before. Without &s;peaking to him, or even looking at him, I continued with that natural tone of voice we make u&s;e of when we are not afraid to permit another per&s;on to hear the whole conver&s;ation. Addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Bo|vile, I &s;aid:</P>
<P>"Murville, I fear, is contriving &s;ome wicked &s;cheme again&s;t me, and I cannot but feel ala<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> for my &s;afety."</P>
<P>"Don't fear him," an&s;wered the friend of Do|lerval,
<PB N="76" REF="035743_0278_1006B25AA6FEA2B0">
"tho&s;e vile &s;educers who are &s;o dangerous, are courageous with women only; again&s;t war|riors they cannot boa&s;t of being courageous and powerful! Whil&s;t one drop of blood flows in my veins, you &s;hall have nothing to fear from your mo&s;t de&s;picable enemies; for the very countenance of a brave man will make them turn pale!"</P>
<P>When he had done &s;peaking this we were at the extremity of the &s;haded alley, near a &s;mall gate, which &s;huts on that &s;ide of the garden next the &s;u|burb. Almo&s;t at the moment when Bovile turned around at the end of this alley, thinking we might &s;afely return to the hou&s;e, the young man, led by a &s;trange impul&s;e of folly, &s;eized me in his arms, and carried me off as &s;wiftly as the lightning. At the &s;ame moment, the gate, &s;eemingly, opened of it&s;elf, and was &s;uddenly &s;hut; by which means I was &s;eparated from my defender in le&s;s time than I can write you an account of it. And, whil&s;t Bovile was probably in amazement at my &s;udden di&s;ap|pearing, and by being &s;hut in the garden could not relieve me, I was put in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, which mu&s;t have been in readine&s;s for this purpo&s;e, and the young man placed him&s;elf by my &s;ide, while the po&s;tillion urged the hor&s;es to &s;uch a degree that we &s;eemed to fly.</P>
<P>Until the moment when the carriage &s;tarted with me, I experienced more a&s;toni&s;hment than fear. "Unhappy Dolerval!" &s;aid I, "what do you mean? To what a &s;trange degree does your pa&s;&s;ion mi&s;lead you! It is a friend whom you &s;o much abu&s;e! It is from the hou&s;e of your Eleanor you are carrying her, whom your ever-re&s;pectful <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> had in&s;pired with&mdash;with e&s;teem! What! Dolerval, are you al&s;o capable of abu&s;ing and in|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ting helple&s;s women?"</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="035743_0279_1006B266F7E9EF30">To this, he gave no an&s;wer, but kept a deaf ear and di&s;dainful look. Then was I agitated by real fear. I loaded the young man with que&s;tions and reproaches, but he ob&s;tinately kept &s;ilence. Fear|ful apprehen&s;ions now troubled my &s;pirits&mdash;cries of terror e&s;caped me. Then, with one hand, he covered my mouth, and, with the other, treated me with in&s;olent behaviour. Enraged, I re&s;i&s;ted him with all my &s;trength; but, at this time, the cruel &s;truggle was interrupted by a combat, &s;till more cruel. We heard the report of a pi&s;tol, the po&s;tillion fell, and called out, "Help!" It was now too late: for a man was at the carriage door. A &s;econd pi&s;tol was fired; by the light which the explo&s;ion produced, I perceived that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in was in a ma&s;k; that he who had in&s;ulted me, and now protected me&punc; was Murville. Murville &s;hielded me with his body, and received the &s;hot which was aimed at me.</P>
<P>"Whoever you are," &s;aid he, "take my pur&s;e and my life, but have &s;ome re&s;pect for &s;o much beauty."</P>
<P>He then &s;earched ha&s;tily for his arms, which he could not find; and as he received the third &s;hot, which, to appearance, did not touch him, he &s;prang out of the carriage, &s;eized his enemy by his throat and threw him down, fell him&s;elf and rolled with him in the du&s;t. "Bring my pi&s;tols!" cried he continually, "my pi&s;tols! they were put under the &s;eat in the bottom of the carriage!"</P>
<P>At this moment of horror, Celina, I was en|dowed with unu&s;ual &s;trength and courage. With all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te I &s;tepped out of the carriage, and thought within my&s;elf, perhaps the hand of a wo|man may di&s;patch a highwayman. Imagine, however, what terror &s;ucceeded this moment of
<PB N="78" REF="035743_0280_1006B26F35EA8550">
courage. At that in&s;tant, I was able to di&s;cern, not far from the combatants, a man, who &s;tood in the attitude of grief and a&s;toni&s;hment, and re|mained an unactive &s;pectator of this fearful &s;truggle. As &s;oon as he &s;aw me, he drew near, and looking upon me attentively, he &s;aid:</P>
<P>"What! Mademoi&s;elle, is it you? Permit me," &s;aid he, &s;natching the pi&s;tols out of my hand, "permit him who &s;aved your life in this very wood, to avenge you. It belongs to me to be revenged of him for the crimes he has forced me to commit. It belongs to me to puni&s;h him."</P>
<P>By this di&s;cour&s;e you will know it was Lafleur, as certainly as I recognized him by his voice; and, con&s;equently, will not need to be told who the &s;avage is, again&s;t whom Murville &s;u&s;tains an un|equal combat.</P>
<P>The raging dome&s;tic then fired upon his ma&s;ter, but with a feeble, ill-directed, and trembling hand: no &s;ooner had he done this, than he &s;taggered and fell down, making &s;trange di&s;tortions. He mu&s;t, however, have wounded his mad accomplice; for he made a dreadful noi&s;e, and &s;eemed to be in great angui&s;h. But he was not in the lea&s;t di&s;heartened, and, as his wound increa&s;ed his fury, &s;o it increa&s;|ed his &s;trength; for he was now enabled to di&s;en|gage him&s;elf from Murville, and ran towards me with his drawn &s;word in his hand. Come, barba|rian! thought I, I will not attempt to take up tho&s;e arms which thy accomplice could not make u&s;e of to de&s;troy thee; for I had a thou&s;and times rather receive death from thy hands, than give it thee my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>But my final hour had not yet come. Murville, animated by a &s;en&s;e of my imminent danger, ran between us: "Poor girl!" &s;aid he, "what have
<PB N="79" REF="035743_0281_1006B271CEF0CC70">
I done! you are the one whom they mo&s;t wi&s;h to de&s;troy." Unhappy man! he both pitied and pro|tected me at the &s;ame time! He parried off &s;everal &s;trokes of the &s;word by his arm, but through wea|rine&s;s, I expected every moment he would fall, and then nothing could prevent his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in from em|bruing his hands in the blood of his &s;i&s;ter. But heaven, in mercy, would, in &s;uch ca&s;e, have pre|vented me from feeling the pangs of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: for all my limbs trembled with horror, my &s;trength for&s;ook me, and, without any &s;en&s;e of my &s;itua|tion, I fell down under the wheels of the carriage.</P>
<P>When I recovered my &s;en&s;es I beheld&mdash;objects of terror! Alas! why was I called back to life? But, Celina, permit me to leave you; permit me to return to the pillow of a dying man!</P>

<P>WORTHY &s;i&s;ter of a woman who&s;e un|rivalled attractions are &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by her goodne&s;s; unfortunate &s;i&s;ter of the mo&s;t execrable villain the earth has ever borne; 'tis Emilia, who&s;e mo&s;t tender and affectionate friend you are, and who&s;e mo&s;t ardent defender I &s;hall always be; 'tis Emilia, overwhelmed with her own troubles, but equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on account of your anxiety, who has charged me to acquaint you with her pre&s;ent &s;ituation! Be comforted; no danger, at pre&s;ent, threatens your &s;i&s;ter. She is without wound.
<PB N="80" REF="035743_0282_1006B277A4D594A8">
But, O that we could place her as far, and as &s;e|curely, from the power of grief, as we have &s;e|cured her from the attempts of a mon&s;ter!</P>
<P>Dolerval, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, ran away with Emilia, whom he &s;natched from me in the garden. Upon this, I flew to the hou&s;e, and found, to my a&s;to|ni&s;hment, that he was &s;eated by his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>"O what a prodigy!" &s;aid I; "yonder I &s;aw you run away with Juliette, and behold you are here!"</P>
<P>"Heavens!" exclaimed Dolerval, "it mu&s;t have been my brother. Ha&s;te! let's pur&s;ue him!"</P>
<P>With all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te we &s;addled our hor&s;es; I took my arms, &s;o as to be provided again&s;t the wor&s;t, and the dome&s;tics were ordered to follow us: but Dolerval and I went full &s;peed, before all the re&s;t, on the way which was taken by Murville.</P>
<P>In a wood, at lea&s;t half a league from Tours, we &s;aw a carriage &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of the road. A woman lay by it in a &s;woon, near whom were two men in a violent conte&s;t. One of them had a &s;word, but the other was without arms. "To me direct your &s;trokes," &s;aid the brave unarmed young man, who was &s;mitten by his enemy and would not retreat.</P>
<P>"He is killing Murville!" cried Dolerval. And in a moment we came up with them, and he whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be a highwayman, fell by the &s;trokes of my &s;word. Murville, through lo&s;s of blood, was unable to &s;upport him&s;elf a moment after the danger was over. We took him and bound up his wounds as well as the &s;mall remains of light would permit. When we had taken care of him, we took Juliette, who had not yet re|covered her &s;en&s;es, and put her into the carriage. Bitter groans were then heard all around us; and
<PB N="81" REF="035743_0283_1006B27B6DC076A0">
one cried out, "I feel within me a raging fire, let &s;omebody help me, and I will tell you the whole."</P>
<P>We &s;earched around after him, and I touched a man with my foot, who was rolling in the du&s;t, and appeared to be in dreadful convul&s;ions. He attempted to &s;peak, but a &s;tronger fit &s;eized him, &s;o that he could make no articulate &s;ounds. A little farther, Dolerval found a man in the agonies of death, who proved to be the po&s;tillion of Mur|ville. And, on the other hand, we heard groans, imprecations and bla&s;phemies, which gave me to under&s;tand that the highwayman I had vanqui&s;hed was not ready to expire. Our &s;ituation among&s;t &s;o many per&s;ons dangerou&s;ly wounded, became every moment more and more embarra&s;&s;ing. At this time I &s;aw a number of per&s;ons coming with torches, and made no doubt but they were fortu|nately coming to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e per&s;ons who were coming proved to be our dome&s;tics; but they came not alone. They e&s;corted a carriage which conveyed to us&mdash;alas! my wife her&s;elf! Being afraid, that after having joined Murville, we might not be able to per&s;uade him to relinqui&s;h his prey, and fearing there would, in con&s;equence of his refu&s;al, ari&s;e a fatal &s;trife between her brothers and hu&s;band, &s;he came hither with an intention of trying her per&s;ua&s;ions upon Murville, which &s;he apparently thought would have more influence than ours. Oh, haple&s;s woman! of what a dread|ful &s;cene will thy ill fate &s;oon render thee both witne&s;s and actre&s;s! What fatal explanations thou art &s;oon to receive!</P>
<P>Murville was the fir&s;t who recovered the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>"In the fir&s;t place," &s;aid he, in a feeble voice,
<PB N="82" REF="035743_0284_1006B28671072D90">
"relieve my doubts. Take the ma&s;k from the face of this robber."</P>
<P>He was &s;oon obeyed, and in the features of this ruffian I recognized tho&s;e of a man whom I view|ed with horror.</P>
<P>"Cruel Varmont!" continued Murville, "you were going to &s;acrifice me for the &s;ake of a wo|man! and not only &s;o, but you al&s;o intended to &s;acrifice your mi&s;tre&s;s!"</P>
<P>"His mi&s;tre&s;s!" cried the man who had &s;poken before; "no, no, his &s;i&s;ter!"</P>
<P>"His &s;i&s;ter!" repeated Murville, with terror and amazement; "his &s;i&s;ter! O matchle&s;s infamy! All is now explained. This is not the fir&s;t time he has attempted to de&s;troy her! And yet I have been the friend and companion of this mon&s;ter! Great God! ju&s;t and merciful God! thou ha&s;t not unju&s;tly nor &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed me!"</P>
<P>"His &s;i&s;ter!" exclaimed Eleanor with &s;tream|ing eyes; "My&s;terious heaven! If this is the bro|ther of Juliette, who&s;e wife then am I?"</P>
<P>"His &s;i&s;ter!" cried Dolerval in de&s;pair; "She is torn from me forever! She is not at liberty! His &s;i&s;ter! O Bovile, unfortunate Bovile, you have then forever lo&s;t mine!"</P>
<P>"Are you Bovile?" &s;aid the elder brother of Madame Florival: "What! is that generous, beau|tiful, and re&s;pectable woman, whom I have &s;o much offended; who&s;e misfortunes I have &s;o cruelly aggravated, and who&s;e virtues I have in&s;ulted&mdash;is &s;he yours? Is this your wife?"</P>
<P>"No," an&s;wered Emilia, who had ju&s;t reco|vered her rea&s;on, "no;" pointing to Madame Florival, "&s;he is his wife."</P>
<P>"How!" re&s;umed Murville; "O yes! my &s;i&s;|ter
<PB N="83" REF="035743_0285_1006B2882B87C4B0">
&mdash;was free, indeed. Bovile, who believed him|&s;elf a widower, and whom we believed was dead, is yet alive! Yes, I remember what Dolerval&mdash; O now I under&s;tand; M. Bovile is found to be the hu&s;band of two wives."</P>
<P>He then reached forth his hand to Madame Flo|rival, viewed her with an air of compa&s;&s;ion, and mingled his tears with hers.</P>
<P>We could not too ha&s;tily quit this horrible &s;cene. Murville propo&s;ed that we &s;hould put him in his own po&s;t-chai&s;e; that Lafleur &s;hould be put in with him, and that &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould &s;tay with Varmont, and watch him until we could return and fetch him. But Emilia, with her wonted ten|derne&s;s, oppo&s;ed it, and would not permit her ex|ecrable brother to be thus de&s;erted. She de&s;ired, or rather commanded (for her de&s;ires, more than ever before, had now acquired the force of com|mands); &s;he de&s;ired that Murville and Lafleur &s;hould be placed in the back part of the berlin, while &s;he, with Madame Florival, &s;hould occupy the fore-&s;eat. By the&s;e means, her two per&s;ecutors might have the con&s;oling, though painful &s;atisfac|tion, of renewing to her the a&s;&s;urances of their re|pentance. By the&s;e means, my two unfortunate wives might &s;it together, embrace each other, and, perhaps, by confounding their &s;orrows, might &s;often them and dimini&s;h their force. By the&s;e means al&s;o, the execrable a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of her whom we all hold dear, embrued with the blood &s;hed by his cruel hand, was ca&s;t alone into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, where his powerle&s;s rage breathed nothing but im|precations.</P>
<P>As to the po&s;tillion of Murville, I ordered his body to be placed upon a hor&s;e. Dolerval and I upon our hor&s;es, kept near the door of the berlin,
<PB N="84" REF="035743_0286_1006B28DEF649568">
by which means we often heard&punc; to our grief, the &s;ighs of the deare&s;t objects of our affection. Being thus prepared, we &s;et off with a &s;low pace, and, with our whole melancholy train, came back to the city.</P>
<P>We had &s;ent a man forward to go after &s;everal &s;urgeons, and when we came home we found them waiting for us. Murville's wounds were examined in the fir&s;t place. Take courage; this brave youth, &s;o noble and generous-hearted, even in his erro|neous and licentious career, corrected by an awful warning and dreadful &s;troke of fortune, will, I tru&s;t, be pre&s;erved for an example of complete amendment to his equals in age and libertine prin|ciples. The ball only glanced upon his brea&s;t, and left but a &s;light contu&s;ion; and, in the unequal &s;truggle again&s;t his well armed enemy, he exer|ci&s;ed &s;o much dexterity, that he received no wounds except upon his arm. And I am happy to inform you that none of his wounds are either dangerous or mortal.</P>
<P>But why is capricious fortune equally favourable to the infamous Varmont? The pi&s;tol &s;hot which he received from his own valet, did, as it were, but glance upon his &s;houlder; and, although I brought him to the ground by &s;everal &s;trokes and thru&s;ts of my &s;word, not one of them is thought to be mortal. The pains which Murville now feels, deprive him of re&s;t; but Varmont has already fallen a&s;leep! I tremble for fear he may be re&s;tored, to continue the &s;courge and di&s;grace of human nature. Should it be &s;o, I &s;hall repent that I did not per|form my part more effectually.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the mi&s;erable Lafleur, much enlightened by the que&s;tions we were obliged to a&s;k him, and &s;till more by the grievous pains he en|dured,
<PB N="85" REF="035743_0287_1006B28F8847B870">
&s;oon conjectured what the phy&s;ician told us in a low voice, and cried out, "I am certainly poi&s;oned, there is no doubt of it." And, at length, when he found there was no relief for him in the remedies pre&s;cribed, and his convul&s;ions becoming more frequent and &s;trong, he de&s;ired Emilia, Do|lerval and my&s;elf, to draw near his bed, and hear his la&s;t confe&s;&s;ions. And what follows is nearly all he told us with which you are unacquainted: I &s;hall not, however, undertake to relate it exactly in the &s;ame ru&s;ticity in which it was delivered.</P>
<P>"When I brought the boat to my ma&s;ter at Bre&s;t, I was ignorant of what he intended to do on board the Centaure. But after the crime was committed, he confe&s;&s;ed it to me, but prote&s;ted that if I betrayed him, he would acknowledge the fact, and, at the &s;ame time, declare that I was his ac|complice, and would per&s;i&s;t in the declaration till the la&s;t moment. Soon afterwards he was inform|ed that his victim was alive, and charged me to go and perform, what he called, our operation. Out of fear, le&s;t the former crime &s;hould be di&s;covered, and le&s;t Varmont &s;hould conduct me to the wheel along with him&s;elf, by declaring me his accom|plice, I was re&s;olved to do it. But I was not hardy enough for &s;uch an exploit; yet I made my ma&s;ter believe I had well performed his commi&s;|&s;ion. Varmont, as I believed, had already deter|mined my ruin, but retained me in his &s;ervice; and I, poor wretch, remained in it, becau&s;e his threaten|ings of pur&s;uing me, in ca&s;e of my leaving him, affrightened me: but, I confe&s;s, my greate&s;t rea&s;ons for &s;taying with him, was the hope of obtaining the money he had promi&s;ed me. He continued to amu&s;e me with fair promi&s;es until he might find a favourable opportunity of putting me out of the
<PB N="86" REF="035743_0288_1006B29967C5BB70">
way. At length, about the fir&s;t of this month, he told me that M. Murville had in&s;ulted him, and refu&s;ed to give him &s;atisfaction, and that he in|tended to give him a challenge. 'I cannot do it at Bre&s;t,' continued he, 'becau&s;e he has too many friends there; but go there your&s;elf, my dear La|fleur, and as &s;oon as he &s;hall be &s;o unfortunate as to leave that city, follow him every where he goes, and do not fail to write me, and let me know where he makes any &s;tay.' Fool that I was! this was the &s;nare in which I was caught my&s;elf! After receiv|ing my fir&s;t letter, my ma&s;ter came with all &s;peed into the neighbourhood of Tours, in which city Murville had been concealed during four days. How it happened I cannot tell, but ye&s;terday was my unlucky day. Early in the morning I gave Varmont an account of what Murville's po&s;tillion, with whom I had ju&s;t been drinking, had told me; which was, that his ma&s;ter expected this very evening to return to his farm, with a little comrade. 'We mu&s;t lie in wait for him on his pa&s;&s;age,' cried he, with great &s;atisfaction. And, in fact, directly after it was noon we went to keep centinel, you know where; and, when it was almo&s;t dark night, we heard the noi&s;e of a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and I thought I heard the voice of James, who was hurrying his hor&s;es. 'Well!' &s;aid my ra&s;cally ma&s;ter; 'but, my dear Lafleur,' added he, taking a vial of brandy out of his pocket, which he knows I love to a rage, 'you mu&s;t fir&s;t take a drink. Take courage, for, perhaps, I &s;hall want your a&s;&s;i&s;tance.' I &s;wallowed it with di&s;patch, but did not tell him till afterwards&mdash;'M. de Varmont, I have no arms.' 'That's ju&s;t as it &s;hould be, poltroon!' an&s;wered he with irony and brutality. 'Have you deceived me then, you beggarly ra&s;cal? Very well! &s;tand &s;till
<PB N="87" REF="035743_0289_1006B29FD64D59C0">
at pre&s;ent, and &s;ee me do it my&s;elf, and if you &s;tir one &s;tep, I'll blow your brains out.' Then he made ha&s;te and got into the road, and as &s;oon as he knew it was the livery &s;ervant of Murville, he ran up to poor James, clapt the pi&s;tol almo&s;t to his brea&s;t, and &s;hot him dead. You know all the re&s;t."</P>
<P>This confe&s;&s;ion, Celina, which was frequently interrupted by the &s;ufferings of the wretch who made it, we could not collect from him in le&s;s than an hour. At length he a&s;ked pardon of his mi&s;|tre&s;s, who was moved with pity and terror, a thou|&s;and times over. He al&s;o de&s;ired her ble&s;&s;ing; and, &s;oon after he had obtained it, happy in the ap|proaching termination of his mi&s;eries, he breathed his la&s;t.</P>
<P>But how &s;hall I de&s;cribe the admirable conduct of your &s;i&s;ter, through the whole cour&s;e of this long and di&s;mal night! Behold our Emilia, anxious about the continual lethargy of her brother, not leaving us a moment but for the purpo&s;e of acquaint|ing you with a part of her late misfortunes; running to the pillow of Varmont, whom &s;he yet calls her brother, but who does not hear her; running al&s;o to that of Murville, who is both comforted and &s;urpri&s;ed at her unmerited kindne&s;s; &s;triving to give courage to Dolerval, who is abandoned to de&s;pair; fortifying my mind again&s;t our hard fortune; unit|ing her tears with tho&s;e of Madame Florival; and &s;ighing, alas! on the death-bed of Lafleur!</P>
<P>But, imagine on the other hand, notwith&s;tand|ing her &s;evere misfortunes, how great mu&s;t be the triumph of her long-per&s;ecuted virtues, and her late acknowledged innocence. Repre&s;ent to your imagination, my dear Eleanor, who, perhaps, is le&s;s afflicted with her own trials and &s;orrows than
<PB N="88" REF="035743_0290_1006B2AA5CC92FB8">
tho&s;e of her friend; and Dolerval, bitterly re|proaching him&s;elf for the unju&s;t jealou&s;y he enter|tained, for the cruel and injurious &s;u&s;picions he was tempted to conceive again&s;t Emilia; whil&s;t Mur|ville, continually becoming more and more con|vinced of his errors, more and more repenting his pa&s;t conduct, and more and more grieved to think he has not merited the e&s;teem of this adorable wo|man! "Yes, Dolerval," cries he, "your &s;enti|ments were ju&s;t; &s;he is, as you &s;aid, <HI>de&s;erving univer&s;al homage!</HI>"</P>
<P>Endeavour to imagine, Celina, how much I am enchanted, and how de&s;perately my feelings mu&s;t be excited, while I behold the&s;e two women, who, if not equally beloved, are at lea&s;t equally accom|pli&s;hed. Strive to form an idea of the alternative horrors and charms which the different pictures around me pre&s;ent to my view!</P>

<P>To day, till the clock &s;truck twelve at noon, &s;he &s;tayed with him, &s;itting con&s;tantly on the &s;ide of his bed, waiting, with impatience, the termina|tion of the oppre&s;&s;ive &s;leep which &s;till held dominion over him. At this time, he awoke, and ca&s;ting his eyes fiercely upon his &s;i&s;ter, he knew her, and
<PB N="89" REF="035743_0291_1006B2ABF02E6960">
&s;prang furiou&s;ly towards her. She &s;creamed aloud with terror, and fled from him; and, as &s;he was fly|ing him, I ha&s;tily &s;tepped between them and &s;topped him. This was a &s;ea&s;onable movement, for had I waited a &s;econd longer, he would have caught her, and then it would have been all over with Emilia! In the mean time he was affected with a burning fever, which gave him prodigious &s;trength; &s;o that if every one in the room had not come to my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, he would have overpowered me. The blood-thir&s;ty &s;avage then turned all his rage again&s;t him&s;elf. He rolled upon the floor, tore him&s;elf, and rent to pieces the bandages which covered his wounds. At fir&s;t they tried to prevent him. "No," &s;aid I, "leave him to accompli&s;h his own fate; he had much better die here than at the place of public execution. Have not his crimes &s;uffi|ciently di&s;tre&s;&s;ed his family?

<P>AFTER &s;o many fatal eclairci&s;&s;ements, and after the unhappy rumour of our misfor|tunes had been &s;pread abroad, it was nece&s;&s;ary, my &s;i&s;ter, that Bovile and Dolerval &s;hould not remain more than twenty-four hours at the place where they could hear the &s;ighs of the unfortunate Elea|nor and di&s;con&s;olate Emilia. They departed toge|ther about three days ago; they are going to follow the &s;eas, in order to le&s;&s;en their &s;orrows and en|courage their hope. Yes, Celina, I &s;ay their hope: for the parting words of Bovile have rai&s;ed my courage, and, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, relieved me from my extreme dejection.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="035743_0293_1006B2B3350AFAC0">"The government," &s;aid he, "an enormous burden, which hangs like a dead weight upon my country, cannot be much longer &s;upported. A reign of iron and du&s;t di&s;honors the people whom it oppre&s;&s;es, and begins to weary its a&s;toni&s;hing patience. In the mean time, the enemies of our nation, actuated by a &s;pirit of inconceivable giddi|ne&s;s, in&s;tead of lightening the yoke, daily continue to render it more burden&s;ome. Soon mu&s;t this op|pre&s;&s;ion come to an end; &s;oon mu&s;t my country be ruined, or undergo a complete regeneration. Alas! I cannot but hope and pray that the great Arbiter of the univer&s;e, who governs and decides the fate of kingdoms and empires, may &s;upport France through the horrors and convul&s;ions of that awful cri&s;is, which alone, after &s;ome moments of an|gui&s;h, can re&s;tore the lu&s;tre of her former youth with a vigor thenceforth unalterable, and rai&s;e her again to the highe&s;t rank among&s;t nations. Then &s;hall we behold the &s;udden fall of many prejudices, as ancient and de&s;picable as the ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition which gave them birth. Then," con|tinued he, pre&s;&s;ing my hand in his own, "your dear Celina will no longer groan in her wretched confinement: for the cloi&s;ters, opened or ra&s;ed to their foundations, will let their victims e&s;cape: then the poor and unfortunate M. Sevin, who is now &s;o wretched, may find &s;ome con&s;olation on earth: for celibacy, not &s;atisfied with filling the convents, but extending even to the clergy, will no longer embrace whole generations. Then," continued he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Madame Florival, "we &s;hall no longer hear our tribunals ring with tho&s;e demands in ca&s;e of a &s;eparation, which mu&s;t be followed with &s;uch great &s;candal, and obtained by
<PB N="92" REF="035743_0294_1006B2B8B766FBC0">
the price of &s;o much di&s;grace; which is attended with the unhappy con&s;equence of condemning young married people, who may be &s;eparated, but not di&s;united, to drag them&s;elves along, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, even to the grave, between the evils of celibacy and the crimes of adultery. Then tho&s;e unions, &s;o improperly termed unions of con|venience, might be ea&s;ily done away; tho&s;e mar|riages, &s;o &s;uddenly contracted by deluded young people, who, not being mutually informed of what fortune each other is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, believed them&s;elves &s;ufficiently acquainted, and often, upon better ac|quaintance, dete&s;t them&s;elves and one another. Then &s;hall we behold many others, not le&s;s un|happy, de&s;irous of becoming hu&s;bands and fathers of families, who are di&s;couraged by the examples of pre&s;ent marriages, are afraid to take a wife who mu&s;t eternally be theirs, and, &s;ooner or later, are found guilty of &s;educing the wives of other men. How many laws are wanting in this va&s;t empire, to in&s;ure a &s;udden reformation in its manners; laws, which, to millions of individuals, would be the end of their misfortunes or beginning of their happi|ne&s;s! One only, the law of Divorce; a law, which, in its effect, would infallibly prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to it. This would impo&s;e on every married per&s;on, an obligation of continually practi&s;ing tho&s;e mutual kindne&s;&s;es, tho&s;e delicate attentions, and tho&s;e tender cares, which might daily increa&s;e their affections. As &s;oon as this be|neficent law &s;hall be proclaimed, a thou&s;and mar|ried per&s;ons will break their chains, which were formed under the yoke of indi&s;&s;olubility; their chains continually bedewed with tears: and, under the mo&s;t favourable au&s;pices, a thou&s;and lovers
<PB N="93" REF="035743_0295_1006B2C0764FA7F0">
will form the de&s;ired union. Dolerval will then obtain the woman he loves, and Bovile, the fortu|nate Bovile, will again find his Eleanor."</P>
<P>Such were his la&s;t words and &s;entiments at part|ing, in which our tender credulity could ea&s;ily confide, and which Eleanor recollects with the greate&s;t delight.</P>
<P>However, this hope, &s;o far removed beyond our pre&s;ent reach, is not &s;ufficient to &s;upport my ex|cellent friend under her &s;orrows: alas! and could I &s;ay it if the unfortunate woman did not repeat|edly &s;ay it her&s;elf, again&s;t her remor&s;e! Notwith|&s;tanding all I can &s;ay or do, &s;he often falls into a deep melancholy, which, I fear, may, in its con|&s;equences, prove as dangerous to her as her tender offspring, on who&s;e conception &s;he often reflects with unavailing regret.</P>
<P>And O that the &s;pectacle of her affliction were the only one which tortures my imagination! But another, not le&s;s painful to endure, although it has but once afflicted my &s;ight, uncea&s;ingly torments me with its cruel remembrance. Have pity upon me, O my &s;i&s;ter; for the portion of evils allotted me is more than I can bear!</P>

<P>IT is &s;ix days, my dear Celina, &s;ince I received your la&s;t letter. It is owing to the di&s;tre&s;s I feel on the &s;ubject of that letter, that I have not, till the pre&s;ent time, had the plea&s;ure of &s;ending
<PB N="94" REF="035743_0296_1006B2C251946D60">
you an an&s;wer. Notwith&s;tanding the injuries we have received from Madame de Varmont&punc; I cannot but lament her untimely death: and as &s;he was our mother, we ought to mourn for her. I believe, with you, that the news of her &s;on's crimes, and his con&s;equent tragical end, too &s;oon &s;pread abroad by the voice of the public, have ha&s;|tened her to the grave. How great mu&s;t have been her &s;ufferings in her la&s;t moments! O my God! God of all ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s! have not her &s;ufferings atoned for her crimes? Freely par|don her, O mo&s;t merciful Father! as I pardon her my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You tell me, my &s;i&s;ter, that nothing can hinder me any longer from retiring to your &s;olitude, there to receive and be&s;tow the con&s;olations which to us are mutually nece&s;&s;ary. Permit me, however, to delay. Madame Florival will need my atten|dance. She expects me to attend her to a certain village, whither &s;he is going to conceal her &s;itua|tion from her acquaintance, and &s;tay till the time of her delivery. After this, &s;he authorizes me to promi&s;e for her, as well as my&s;elf, to go and take refuge in your convent. M. Murville has reco|vered of his wounds, and is now at Bre&s;t. But he has given his &s;i&s;ter encouragement to expect he will accompany her to Paris whenever &s;he is pre|pared to e&s;tabli&s;h her&s;elf there, with my &s;i&s;ter and me. In con&s;equence of this, I have taken all my arrangements accordingly: for I know you too well to &s;uppo&s;e you will require me to abandon my friend when &s;he will mo&s;t require my atten|dance.</P>
<P>As to one particular cau&s;e or &s;ubject of afflic|tion, of which you accu&s;e me of wi&s;hing to hide from you, I am now ready to reveal it. In the
<PB N="95" REF="035743_0297_1006B2C86ACAA6A0">
fir&s;t moments of our agitation, on parting with Bovile and Dolerval, almo&s;t every circum&s;tance of it was out of my mind; but &s;ince that time, by a &s;trange and inevitable propen&s;ity, it con|&s;tantly employs my thoughts.</P>
<P>Our brother, my dear Celina, in a fit, during his ardent fever, attempted to de&s;troy me; and, in the angui&s;h of his delirium, he &s;trove in vain to de&s;troy him&s;elf. I found there was no relief for him except in the tender mercies of God. I &s;up|po&s;ed the all-powerful con&s;olations of religion would, di&s;&s;ipate the fearful alienation of his mind. After it was noon, I had repeatedly required a confe&s;&s;or, who had not arrived. At length, when the fury of the poor mortal was &s;o great that every per&s;on in the room was employed to re&s;train him, I ran out my&s;elf. In the city of Tours, where I was totally unacquainted, I could not go to in|quire for a prie&s;t; but I went to the neighbouring village, fully per&s;uaded that the curate of St. Cyr would not refu&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I a &s;hort time I arrived at the par&s;onage. Ru&s;|&s;el, the old dome&s;tic of Madame Florival, opened the door, and, with &s;urprize in his countenance, a&s;ked me what I wanted.</P>
<P>"To &s;peak with M. Sevin," an&s;wered I.</P>
<P>"With M. Sevin, Mademoi&s;elle!"</P>
<P>"Why, yes."</P>
<P>"With M. Sevin! is the young lady &s;ure of it?"</P>
<P>"What a que&s;tion is this!" replied I: and, pu&s;hing him away in a gentle manner, I went in.</P>
<P>"Very well, young lady," &s;aid he, "I am not made to employ my &s;trength again&s;t you: look in the garden."</P>
<P>Upon this I ran thither. "M. Sevin," &s;aid I, "come quick!"</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="035743_0298_1006B2CFF5E4D830">"Poh!" cried he; "is it &s;he who is there?"</P>
<P>"Of whom do you &s;peak?"</P>
<P>"Oh! but it &s;eems to be her! Ah! of whom &s;hould I &s;peak?"</P>
<P>"But we do not under&s;tand one another! I pray you to go and vi&s;it a &s;ick per&s;on, in order to perform your la&s;t duties to him."</P>
<P>"Oh! is that all," replied he, and turned around to go back again.</P>
<P>"But it is one of my relations who is in a dy|ing &s;tate."</P>
<P>"What, then! this is no urgent matter. Be|&s;ides," &s;aid he, "why do you come to entertain me with death? let's talk of nothing but marriage."</P>
<P>"But my &mdash;"</P>
<P>"I cannot, fair lady," interrupted he. "She can|not come but while I am without! imagine&mdash;."</P>
<P>"But, my uncle!&mdash;"</P>
<P>Hearing this, he turned round; and the air with which he viewed me confirmed me in a melancholy truth, which, in the fluttering &s;tate of my mind, I did not perceive before. "Yes," &s;aid he, with much &s;oftne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, "it was by this title &s;he once called me! Do you know her then?"</P>
<P>"My dear uncle!" At fir&s;t, in an impul&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion and &s;urprize, I attempted to take him by the hand.</P>
<P>"Don't touch my hand," cried he, drawing back: "don't touch my&mdash;. She ki&s;&s;ed my hand! And hold: there is the place" (pointing to his hand). "O &s;weet and beloved girl! It was in this place &s;he dropt a tear&mdash;My lips immediately collected it; and I felt it even to my heart. Take care! you are going to &s;tep upon this honey&s;uckle! I had rather any one &s;hould walk upon my body. It was &s;he who propped it! Be&s;ides, I take great

care of it my&s;elf. The others with&s;tand the win|ter very well; but this mu&s;t be exceedingly tender; and, to keep it in better &s;afety, I have covered it with &s;traw.&mdash;Come this way: the flowers which you &s;ee here I have put in this &s;ort of green-hou&s;e; becau&s;e I mu&s;t keep them to the end of my life. Only con&s;ider, it was &s;he who has &s;prinkled them with water an hundred times. Don't you think, when &s;he returns, that &s;he will be plea&s;ed to find every thing as it was, and in the be&s;t &s;tate po&s;&s;i|ble?"</P>
<P>While he was &s;peaking in this manner, I was far from feeling ea&s;y, and gradually withdrew from him, and advanced towards the par&s;onage.</P>
<P>"You are removing from this grove," &s;aid he, "and you do well. Love in this place is but a terrible god. It was here that an unju&s;t jealou&s;y tore my heart a&s;under: here it was that my malady commenced. My God, what a malady! I thought I &s;hould have died of it: and, had it not been for Dolerval, I &s;hould have died. I took it in my head to believe &s;he loved me better than him. I did not con&s;ider that &s;he could not di&s;cover her love for me until they &s;hould marry the prie&s;ts. It was me &s;he loved, and not Dolerval. This dear friend told me &s;o him&s;elf. How then! he has done better. One day&mdash;on that day I was ready to go into the other world: I could neither eat nor &s;leep; fooli&s;h be&s;ides. Always complaining; &s;triking the third and fourth parts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of mu&s;ic.</NOTE> to no purpo&s;e. Well, Ma|dame, he came&mdash;this dear friend. He brought with him, from Paris, a large gentleman,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This gentleman, it &s;eems probable, was the phy&s;ician Dolerval brought from Paris.</NOTE> of good

countenance and good humor. But a brave man he was! He was not afraid of me! and a learned man. This polite man could &s;peak Latin as well as my&s;elf. Madame, he was the father of my &s;weet mi&s;tre&s;s. 'Do not be di&s;couraged,' &s;aid he; '&s;he loves you; &s;he will come to-morrow! To-morrow they will marry the prie&s;ts!"</P>
<P>By this time we had come to the yard, and I ha&s;tened to get to the door. "Go into the hou&s;e, one moment," &s;aid he. I endeavoured to get rid of him; but he held me by my arm. Then Ru&s;|&s;el &s;poke to me in a low voice, and told me not to re&s;i&s;t him, and a&s;&s;ured me that M. Sevin would not do me the lea&s;t injury. Upon this, I yielded to his entreaties. No &s;ooner had we entered the dining room than a great number of birds came fly|ing around us, and &s;everal of them, as it were in &s;trife, repeated, "Juliette, Juliette!" And ano|ther of them very di&s;tinctly &s;aid, "come to-mor|row!" "Yes," &s;aid my uncle, leaping for joy, "yes! becau&s;e to-morrow they will marry the prie&s;ts! It is true I expected her to-day," conti|nued he, pointing to a plate covered with a napkin, "but I am mi&s;taken. It is to-morrow! becau&s;e it is to-morrow they will marry the prie&s;ts. Wait for her to come, that you may li&s;ten to her mu&s;ic."</P>
<P>Saving this, he led me into the next room, and &s;eated him&s;elf by the &s;ide of the piano, took his ba&s;e-viol, made a &s;hort prelude, and endeavoured to per&s;uade me that a woman was &s;inging, and he accompanying her voice with his in&s;trument. In a little time his in&s;trument fell from his trembling hands, and he li&s;tened with mute attention. At length he fell upon his knees, "Sweet mi&s;tre&s;s!" &s;aid he, "well beloved! enchanting girl! &s;oul of
<PB N="99" REF="035743_0301_1006B2DA5911C920">
my life! come! don't delay! come to-morrow; for to-morrow they will marry the prie&s;ts."</P>
<P>And I, my &s;i&s;ter, a witne&s;s of his &s;en&s;ele&s;s tran&s;|ports, could not refrain from tears; and could not but make this indi&s;crete exclamation, "Poor M. Sevin!"</P>
<P>"Do not pity me," an&s;wered he, "I am the happie&s;t of men. I have, in this manner, heard her all day long! All night long I &s;eemed to &s;ee her! But to-morrow &s;he will certainly come! To-morrow I &s;hall really &s;ee her, for to-morrow they will marry the prie&s;ts. But go now: you will wait too long; &s;he will not &s;ing under two long hours. You know that otherwi&s;e &s;he would hurt her lungs. And if you &s;hould die, Juliette! if you &s;hould die! the whole world, the world which you captivate, would, at once, come to nothing."</P>
<P>At this time we came to the door, and I was extremely &s;olicitous of e&s;caping this too affecting, and too doleful &s;pectacle. "Oh!" &s;aid he, "&s;ince you are acquainted with her, endeavour to accom|pany her this evening. Talk with her concerning him who adores her. Tell her, that for her I have pre&s;erved every &s;weet remembrance; that it is for her I langui&s;h; that I wait for her with the impa|tience of a lover. Oh! let her come, &s;weet mi&s;|tre&s;s! Let her come to-morrow! becau&s;e, to-mor|row is the day when they will marry the prie&s;ts!"</P>
<P>How great, my dear Celina, is the frailty of human rea&s;on! In this poor unfortunate man we may behold a &s;triking picture of its imbecility. This, alas! is the con&s;equence of my imprudence! What &s;tupidity in me to retire to &s;uch a place for &s;ecurity again&s;t human pa&s;&s;ions! In every place to which I have retired, I have conveyed mi&s;ery and di&s;order!

Is he not as fatally &s;eparated from me? Can I ever become his? Tell me, my &s;i&s;ter, is not M. Dolerval as much to be pitied? No, certainly: for he is the object beloved. Heavens! Celina, what have I written? What doleful thoughts po&s;&s;e&s;s me? Almo&s;t under the eye of a hu&s;band! Almo&s;t at the grave of a mother! Ah, my &s;i&s;ter, how &s;ad is my condition!</P>

<P>JUST heaven! In what an aby&s;s of gloomine&s;s and mi&s;ery do I find my&s;elf, and in which I am lo&s;t! A &s;udden fla&s;h of lightning ca&s;ts into it a horrible gleam of light, by which I behold, almo&s;t at my &s;ide, the daughter whom I buried alive, clad in mourning ve&s;tments; and, &s;omewhat farther&mdash; but a few &s;teps at mo&s;t, I behold a mon&s;ter, born of me!&mdash;embruing his hands in his younger &s;i&s;ter's blood! My eyes, alas! are opened&mdash;too late! and are about to be clo&s;ed forever.</P>
<P>But you, my daughters, whom I have &s;o cruelly immolated; who, &s;eemingly, ought to have breathed nothing but hatred again&s;t me, may learn, perhaps, in the end, that I am de&s;erving your pity.</P>
<P>My barbarous parents, al&s;o, made a &s;acrifice of

me. I was &s;acrificed with, perhaps, greater inhu|manity at the marriage bed, than you, Celina, at the altars of religion. A pa&s;&s;ion, ardent in its commencement, had inflamed my heart. At this time, they propo&s;ed to me, for a hu&s;band, M. de Varmont. Alas! what did the only plea&s;ures which nature &s;eeks, even in her rude &s;implicity, avail me in my lively adole&s;cence; of what con&s;e|quence were the talents, the wounds and victories of a brave man to me&punc; It was not the mo&s;t ex|perienced, the mo&s;t brave, nor the mo&s;t renowned that I de&s;ired. The younge&s;t and mo&s;t &s;prightly were, in my fancy, the mo&s;t amiable; and I had already determined my choice: nothing was want|ed to complete my wi&s;hes but the con&s;ent of my parents. But to my entreaties they turned a deaf ear. They &s;natched from me the object of my tendere&s;t affections, and ca&s;t me, like a &s;lave, into the arms of this &s;tranger. What horror &s;eized me when I became capable of under&s;tanding the duties they had impo&s;ed on me, in their full extent! Tho&s;e ties with which they had bound me, were indi&s;&s;oluble! Even to my grave, without relief or without intermi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t I wear my dete&s;table chain.</P>
<P>De&s;pair took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, a &s;oul as im|petuous in its hatred as its love. Attend, my daugh|ters, and blu&s;h at my deep di&s;grace; tremble to reflect on the extreme misfortune which extorts the confe&s;&s;ion from me. My ever-oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ex has but one mean of obtaining revenge, and that is &s;peedy, ea&s;y and infallible. Without delay, I en|deavoured to employ it. Poor Emilia! let her be le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at the cruelty of her brother. She and her cruel a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in had not the &s;ame father. This barbarous youth was not the &s;on of M. de

Varmont. He was neither the child of love nor marriage; but the fruit of a premeditated criminal intrigue.</P>
<P>This was not all. I did not commit this crime to hide it from my hu&s;band: for I expected he would di&s;own and for&s;ake me when the child of my infidelity was brought to the light. This was what I de&s;ired and intended. But, to my di&s;ap|pointment and grief, it happened quite otherwi&s;e: from my &s;toic of a hu&s;band I obtained nothing but the per&s;ecutions of tyrannical jealou&s;y. This pretended hero was &s;o weak as to per&s;ecute me with his odious love, notwith&s;tanding my delibe|rate infidelity, and though I took pride in his di&s;|honor, * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *. Pardon me, O my daughters! for I dete&s;ted you becau&s;e I knew you to be his children!</P>
<P>Towards my &s;on, I pre&s;erved a continual and fatal partiality, and brought him up in the hatred of his &s;i&s;ters. He was taught to view the daugh|ters of his &s;uppo&s;ed father in the light of trouble|&s;ome co-heirs of a large fortune; intruders who were born to deprive him hereafter of a great part of tho&s;e immen&s;e riches, which ought to be re&s;erv|ed for his mother, as an only and &s;mall indemnifi|cation for the mi&s;eries &s;he endured for his &s;ake. How well did the hard-hearted youth improve his wicked in&s;tructions! What a dreadful price he has paid me for the unnatural le&s;&s;ons I gave him!</P>
<P>Although an unfaithful and incomplete recital of his crimes may have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, extenuated their horrors, yet it has frozen my heart with ter|ror, and his cruel &s;pirit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es me! His &s;oul, in|&s;en&s;ible to the cries of nature and kindred blood, has taken complete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mine! This cruel &s;on, although he is no more, &s;till urges me to the
<PB N="103" REF="035743_0305_1006B2F59BFBD950">
commi&s;&s;ion of unnatural deeds. 'Tis the phrenzy of his &s;oul by which I am hurried along. By another crime, his mother is about to follow him to that execrable tomb, into which his enormities have thrown him!</P>
<P>Adieu, my daughters&mdash;your father's pi&s;tols are on the table before me while I am writing this &s;et|ter. I have charged them without trembling, and, without trembling, &s;hall I make u&s;e of them. I &s;hall not leave the bu&s;ine&s;s of my de&s;truction to the pains of a &s;low poi&s;on, nor apply for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the feeble &s;uccours of art; nor, like a feeble victim, &s;truggle &s;everal hours with death. No, let a &s;ud|den, &s;ingle and remedile&s;s &s;troke, cut &s;hort my de&s;tiny; and let renowned warriors, who are vainly proud of their courage, learn, that even a woman can attain to that &s;ublime virtue.</P>
<P>No one, however, will &s;upport me in the hor|ror and confu&s;ion of my la&s;t moments! Not one word of comfort will be addre&s;&s;ed to me! Nor will one of my children be pre&s;ent to clo&s;e my eyes! Thy children! wretched woman! thou never had&s;t but one. He it is who &s;tands near, waiting for thee, urging and beckoning thee away! he who is continually &s;aying, "Cruel mother! which of thy daughters was the mo&s;t worthy? Which of them ha&s;t thou rendered the mo&s;t un|fortunate?" Alas! when they &s;hall receive this vain memorial of my guilt, I &s;hall be no more. Al|though I have been a continual cau&s;e of their un|happine&s;s, the manner of my death may bring tears from their eyes, and pity from their tender hearts. But what dangerous thoughts are the&s;e which pur|&s;ue my imagination, and delay my de&s;igns! Per|haps, by a longer delay, my weakne&s;s may pre|vent their execution. Ha&s;ten, haple&s;s woman!

<P>YES, my dear and benevolent Emilia, come at &s;ome future day, and again be the con|&s;olation of thy &s;i&s;ter; come&mdash;but be, in the fir&s;t place, the pre&s;erver of thy friend.</P>

<P>But let us attend to a melancholy &s;ubject&mdash;let your tears flow again&mdash;tears of tender compa&s;&s;ion. Read the enclo&s;ed letter, written entirely by the hand of Madame de Varmont, which was not found till the opening of the papers which con|tained her will. Read, my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;you will doubt|le&s;s tremble&mdash;but you will, perhaps, &s;ee that our mother, though dying by a crime, merited the pre|&s;ence of her daughters to clo&s;e her eyes.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of <HI>Emilia de Varmont</HI> &s;ubjoined the following addre&s;s to his readers, at the conclu|&s;ion of the third volume:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>When the National A&s;&s;embly &s;hall have de|creed <HI>the marriage of the Prie&s;ts and Divorce,</HI> it will then be lawful for me to give you, in a &s;hort pamphlet, which, if you plea&s;e, you may call a &s;upplement, the details of a triple marriage, that may, perhaps, be intere&s;ting to the reader: that of Bovile and Eleanor, that of Dolerval and Emilia, that of M. Sevin and &mdash;; I will tell you who&mdash;I will then tell you what woman, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch charms as greatly to re&s;emble his Juliette, has been able to re&s;tore the good Curate to rea&s;on and happine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The American publi&s;her, de&s;irous of gratifying that curio&s;ity which mu&s;t ari&s;e in the minds of American youth, after reading the foregoing rela|tion, informs them, that as the original author has fallen a &s;acrifice to the guillotine, it is doubtful whether the promi&s;ed pamphlet has ever been pub|li&s;hed. But as all the ob&s;tacles to their union were removed, when the de&s;ired laws were proclaimed, there is no doubt that Bovile and Eleanor, as well as Dolerval and Emilia, have long &s;ince met, and enjoyed all the endearments of conjugal affection. A gentleman from the city of Tours has informed the publi&s;her, that the good Curate, with whom he was per&s;onally acquainted, actually tried the plea&s;ant &s;tate of matrimony &s;oon after the law had pa&s;&s;ed the National A&s;&s;embly. Who &s;he was I have not been able to learn. In this particular I

mu&s;t leave you in the wide fields of conjecture. Permit me now to remind the youth&punc; of our highly favoured country, that vice will always be brought to ruin, di&s;grace or repentance&mdash;that per&s;evering virtue will ever find a certain and glorious reward.</P>
