<P>THE Sub&s;tance of the following Piece was drawn up by a Friend to American Liberty, to oblige a few of his Friends, &s;ome of whom were for, and others again&s;t a Reconciliation with Great- Britain; they on both Sides freely peru&s;ed it in Manu&s;cript, and as the principal Sub|ject of it is become a general Subject of Conver&s;ation, is in it&s;elf very important, and ought to be deliberately weighed before 'tis determined; it appeared to &s;ome of the Per&s;ons into who&s;e hands the Manu&s;cript had fallen, that it would be proper to have it laid before the Public; accordingly they &s;ent it to the Printer. And though this is chiefly on one Side of the Que&s;tion, yet they would be willing to &s;ee the Argu|ments on the other Side calmly and ration|ally urged, and the Subject &s;et to view in its full Light.</P>
<P>As a Matter of &s;uch Importance &s;hould be well weighed before its determined, and cannot be well weighed and con&s;idered, unle&s;s the Rea&s;ons on both Sides are pro|perly viewed; 'tis proper the Rea&s;ons on both Sides &s;hould be fairly exhibited.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE RECONCILIATION 0F GREAT-BRITAIN AND THE COLONIES.</HEAD>
<P>A RECONCILIATION between Great Britain and the Colonies, has been much in the thoughts of the Ameri|cans. At the beginning of the war it was ardently de&s;ired in general, if not by all; but now it is not de&s;ired, but feared by ma|ny; and it has become a public inquiry whether it is be&s;t there &s;hould be a recon|ciliation, or a proper &s;eparation, and we in America be independent. It certainly mu&s;t be agreeable to all rational people to have the war properly terminated. But how &s;hall it be done? It certainly will be very difficult to heal the breach that has been made, and bring the war to a proper end and i&s;&s;ue. It was begun, and has been carried on in &s;uch a manner, that the ter|mination
<PB N="6" REF="014791_0005_0F94A8E393C48C00">
of it, mu&s;t be peculiarly difficult. Whenever the &s;ettlememt of our affairs is attempted, it &s;hould be with great delibe|ration and calmne&s;s. Self-intere&s;t, party &s;pirit, heats and animo&s;ities &s;hould have no part in a matter of &s;o great importance.</P>
<P>To terminate the pre&s;ent war, to deter|mine the rights and privileges of America, and &s;ettle its civil government, is a mo&s;t momentous affair. It is to do the work of ages; it &s;hould not be done &s;uddenly. All po&s;&s;ible light and a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be afford|ed to tho&s;e that manage the bu&s;ine&s;s. It is really too much to tru&s;t to any number of men, as repre&s;entatives, if it could po&s;&s;ibly be avoided. If it was po&s;&s;ible, it would be be&s;t the whole continent &s;hould give their voice in the matter: But a few no doubt mu&s;t be tru&s;ted with this intere&s;ting concern; and they will doubtle&s;s find it a weight that they will be ready to groan un|der, if they are impartial and faithful men, as I tru&s;t they will be. It is &s;o great an affair, that it &s;hould with caution be en|tru&s;ted to any men. Their is danger of men. There is danger that they may be mi&s;taken, or bia&s;&s;ed, or &s;ome way influ|enced to take a wrong mea&s;ure. If Britain conde&s;cends to treat with America, by ge|neral congre&s;s, or any repre&s;entatives of
<PB N="7" REF="014791_0006_0F94A8E456B779B8">
ours, &s;he will no doubt u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible art, proffer many favours, nor will her money be hid from tho&s;e that are entru&s;ted to &s;ettle the affair. In this view we have more rea|&s;on to fear the money and favours of Bri|tain, than her arms, and open oppo&s;ition. Tho&s;e have often done more fatal execution than the&s;e. But we have rea&s;on to hope: Our congre&s;s has done worthily. They have nobly expo&s;ed their lives and e&s;tates in the cau&s;e of liberty, and defence of their country; and &s;hall they, or any others that may come in their room, give up our pri|vileges? God forbid! I tru&s;t it will not be.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t now &s;aid, that if po&s;&s;ible the whole continent &s;hould &s;ettle our affairs; but &s;ince it mu&s;t be done by repre&s;entatives, they &s;hould as much as po&s;&s;ible know the minds of the people in general. For this rea&s;on among others, it &s;hould not be done ha&s;tily. Whenever an accommodation is propo&s;ed, it would be well for every coun|try, if not city and town, to publi&s;h their views or &s;entiments of the thing, as was done re&s;pecting our liberties at the begin|ning of our pre&s;ent troubles. Then, almo&s;t every county, and many towns met and publi&s;hed their re&s;olves, concerning our rights and privileges, which thing greatly tended to unite and &s;trengthen the whole
<PB N="8" REF="014791_0007_0F94A8E51DCF6C88">
continent. Something &s;imilar might be done now, or when matters are about to be &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The &s;ettlement of American government being as we hope for ages, or even to the end of time, we may well take time for it; u&s;e all proper means, and get all po&s;&s;ible light. For this rea&s;on it might be proper, that a number of pieces &s;hould be publi&s;hed on the occa&s;ion, with calmne&s;s, temper and &s;ound rea&s;oning. There will be differ|ent &s;entiments, and which all may publi&s;h with candour, and offer their rea&s;ons fairly. The grand inquiry is, concerning the i&s;&s;ue of the war; in what way and manner it mu&s;t be accompli&s;hed, or attempted; or how we &s;hall &s;ettle matters with Great Bri|tain? And here an intere&s;ting and impor|tant inquiry occurs, viz. Shall we be re|conciled to Great Britain, &s;o as to be under her government, or &s;hall we be indepen|dent? To determine this, another que&s;tion ari&s;es, viz. Have we a right to be indepen|dent? We all believe an over-ruling provi|dence, we have appealed and applied to God in our pre&s;ent &s;truggle; we believe that the &s;overeign of the univer&s;e, the judge of all the earth, di&s;po&s;es of nations and kingdoms, and that &s;ooner or later he will vi&s;it for iniquity. We have rea&s;on
<PB N="9" REF="014791_0008_0F94A8E7134958F0">
therefore to view the equity of our pro|ceedings, and inquire whether we have a right to be independent.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion then is, Has Britain for|feited her right to our dependence, &s;o that &s;he cannot in ju&s;tice claim it, nor we be under any obligation to &s;ubmit to it? It is certain we were once dependent, and under Briti&s;h government; it is a proper enquiry then, How can we be independent? To know whether Britain has forfeited her right to our dependence, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the appendix at the end.</NOTE> we mu&s;t a little con&s;ider the nature of civil government.&mdash; In a &s;tate of nature, as in the fir&s;t ages of the world, or before mankind were formed into &s;ocieties for civil government, every man had a right to enjoy him&s;elf, and the work of his hands, and what he took in hunting, &amp;c. if he injured not any of his fellow creatures, who had the &s;ame right. And in that &s;tate of nature, each man had a right to defend and vindicate him&s;elf, if a&s;&s;aulted or injured by others. But when men were formed into civil &s;ocieties, each man gave up this right to defend and vindi|cate him&s;elf, to judge and determine in his own ca&s;e, and left all this to the civil ma|gi&s;trate; and the duty and proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the civil magi&s;trate, was, is, and ever will
<PB N="10" REF="014791_0009_0F94A8E7549B19C8">
be, to defend and protect the people, in the peaceable enjoyment of their properties and privileges.</P>
<P>The whole de&s;ign of civil government or magi&s;tracy, is the good of the people. A magi&s;trate as &s;uch, has no right or autho|rity but from the people. It is true a man may in a tyrannical and arbitrary manner, a&s;&s;ume power over others, and oblige them to &s;ubmit, as has often been the ca&s;e; and the people may think proper &s;o to do; and this their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion may become a &s;ort of compact, and the ruler and ruled be mutu|ally bound to each other. But &s;till the pro|per end and de&s;ign of magi&s;tracy, is the good of the people, and in rea&s;on and equi|ty it cannot be any thing el&s;e. This is &s;o ea&s;y that I need not enlarge. A magi&s;trate then by office, and by oath, if there is an oath in the ca&s;e, is bound to defend his &s;ubjects in the enjoyment of their proper|ties and privileges, and people are bound to him only in con&s;equence of this, or in connection with it. To &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e would be to de&s;troy all liberty and property, and to promote the mo&s;t ab&s;olute tyranny; but I need not in&s;i&s;t, for this is out of di&s;|pute.</P>
<P>To come to the ca&s;e in hand then, let us &s;uppo&s;e that Britain, or any other kingdom,
<PB N="11" REF="014791_0010_0F94A8E9AAA36BA8">
had a part of its dominions, an i&s;land, or continent, lying at a di&s;tance, America for in&s;tance. That this &s;hould be attacked by a foreign enemy; upon which America cries to Britain the &s;ource of national pow|er, for protection and defence. Britain re|gards not, protects not, but leaves them to the rage and fury of their enemy, by whom America is at length overcome and &s;ubdued, when Britain had it in her power to have afforded help, protected and &s;aved them. After &s;ome time, by &s;ome means America extricates it&s;elf out of the hand of the ene|my, and defends her&s;elf. Has Britain, af|ter this, a right to govern America, and require &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her authority? Would not Britain's right to American government and dependence be forfeited? The ca&s;e is clear; Britain did not her duty to protect and defend, but left America to be &s;ubdued by another, and America is thereby entire|ly free from Briti&s;h authority.</P>
<P>Again, let us &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e, that when America had been thus attacked, and left de&s;titute of Briti&s;h protection, America was not &s;ubdued by the enemy, but after a long &s;truggle, while Britain had opportunity to interpo&s;e, but would not, the Americans &s;hould get the better of their enemies, though at a va&s;t expence of blood and trea|&s;ure;
<PB N="12" REF="014791_0011_0F94A8EA93DB9288">
would America, after that, be under any obligation to &s;ubmit to Briti&s;h authori|ty? By no means. America had not the protection that was her due, but expended her own blood and trea&s;ure, and no thanks to Britain &s;he was not wholly de&s;troyed. Again, &s;uppo&s;e that in&s;tead of leaving Ame|rica to the depradation, of a foreign ene|my, Britain her&s;elf &s;hould act the part of an enemy; refu&s;e us the privileges which are ours by con&s;titution, &s;eize our proper|ties, and deprive us of our mutual rights; in which ca&s;e America expo&s;tulates, pleads, &s;ubmits to all equitable impo&s;itions, which are according to con&s;titution, begs &s;he may be relieved, and not driven to extremities; but Britain proves deaf to entreaties, &s;eizes our properties, and deprives us of our pri|vileges, by which means America is obliged to defend her&s;elf, by force, which in t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> rea&s;on and nature of things, &s;he has a right to do. That in this ca&s;e we have a right to defend our&s;elves, is determined by the declaration and conduct of the&s;e colonies in the pre&s;ent &s;truggle, therefore will not now be di&s;puted by Americans.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not pretend to rea&s;on with profe&s;&s;ed tories, but with tho&s;e that allow, that we have righteou&s;ly and proper|ly taken up arms in our defence.</NOTE></P>
<P>To proceed then; &s;uppo&s;e in this &s;truggle America &s;hould, after &s;pilling much blood,
<PB N="13" REF="014791_0012_0F94A8EB1A0D4408">
and expending much trea&s;ure, get the bet|ter of Britain and prevail till Britain choo&s;es to cea&s;e ho&s;tilities: would America then be under obligation to &s;ubmit to Briti&s;h go|vernment? Every rational per&s;on would &s;ay, that Britain had forfeited her right to American dependence. There can be no more rea&s;on why we &s;hould &s;ubmit to Britain, after &s;he had acted the part of a cruel enemy her&s;elf, than if &s;he had left America to the rage of a foreign enemy. Yea much le&s;s rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I have only one ca&s;e more to &s;uppo&s;e; Should Britain proceed again&s;t America, as in the la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, till &s;he had put us to much expence, &s;hed much of our be&s;t blood, burnt our &s;ea port towns, deprived us of our trade, and means of livelihood, but when &s;he found it would not an&s;wer to proceed again&s;t us to bring things to a cri&s;is by the &s;word, &s;hould propo&s;e a reconciliati|on, by our being under her government; are we obliged in ju&s;tice to comply? Has &s;he a right to require it? This is our ca&s;e. What obliges us to &s;ubmit to Briti&s;h goverment! It is not for want of will and di&s;po&s;ition, in her that &s;he does not proceed again&s;t us to the utmo&s;t. She has endeavoured to cru&s;h us, and expected that what &s;he has done would have accompli&s;hed it. Britain
<PB N="14" REF="014791_0013_0F94A8EBD6C70A18">
expected by her armed force, the Fi&s;hery Bill, and others of the &s;ame cruel kind, by &s;tarving and blood &s;hed, to have reduced us to an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. She has acted di|rectly contrary to all her obligations to pro|tect and defend us, mo&s;t unju&s;tly pro|nounced us rebels, and treated us as &s;uch:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And is &s;till treating us as rebels. How &s;trange is it that Britain &s;hould declare us rebels, &s;eize our effects, and try every way to hurt us, at the &s;ame time that &s;he propo&s;es an accommodation, and appoints Commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with us! Is it not evident that the commi&s;&s;ion for an accomodation is nothing but a &s;ham, de&s;igned to blind the people in England and keep them quiet, while they are made to believe, that the Americans have very generous terms of accomodation offered them, and al&s;o to give the tories among us, a covered opportunity to ex|ert them&s;elves and cau&s;e divi&s;ions?</NOTE>
She propo&s;ed to bring the body of the people into &s;ubjection, and &s;et the heads of &s;ome of the chiefs; upon Temple Bar. Let her dreadful and bloody treatment of us, again&s;t all our cries and petitions for lenity, a long time pre&s;ented, appear in its proper light, and &s;tand full in view, as it ought; and in that view judge whether &s;he has forfeited her right to our depen|dence and government, and whether it is nece&s;&s;ary in point of equity for us to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>But if Britain has forfeited her right, and we are at liberty in point of equity to
<PB N="15" REF="014791_0014_0F94A8ECA9F38468">
be independent; yet it is a query whether it is prudent; whether it will be be&s;t for us to a&s;&s;ume our right, and whether on the whole we ought not yet to de&s;ire and en|deavour to be in connection, and under the government of Great-Britain. I come therefore to view the arguments for and again&s;t our reconciliation with Great-Britain.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t Argument.</HI> However, we may view the thing, Britain will not give up her right to govern us, but will &s;trenuou&s;ly in|&s;i&s;t upon it, &s;o that if we declare for inde|pendency, it will involve us in a long and bloody war, and be our utter ruin in the end; e&s;pecially as in this ca&s;e our friends in Great Britain will for&s;ake us, &s;ince mo&s;t, if not all of them, have befriended us on &s;uppo&s;ition, that we will &s;till be in &s;ubjec|tion to Great-Britain. Our having &s;o ma|ny friends in Great-Britain, is the rea&s;on that our enemies find them&s;elves perplexed, and cannot &s;o fully exert them&s;elves again&s;t us; if it is once found that we declare for independency, Britain will be united again&s;t us. Tho&s;e that have been our friends will no longer embarra&s;s our enemies, but Bri|tain united, will exert her&s;elf again&s;t us, with &s;uch vigour, that we &s;hall &s;oon be overcome, or reduced to unknown difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="014791_0015_0F94A8ED54010090"><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Let Britain be ever &s;o much united, &s;he cannot victual out an army and fleet, and maintain them at this di&s;tance, &s;o as to de&s;troy, or reduce us to unknown difficulty. Should Britain, without foreign aid, attempt to fit out and victual an army of 25,000 men, and 10,000 &s;ailors to guard our coa&s;t, it would cau&s;e &s;uch a &s;car|city among them&s;elves as would be their ruin, now their trade is &s;o dimini&s;hed, and their importation of provi&s;ions from us cut off. But &s;uppo&s;e they could and &s;hould do this; an army of 25,000, and 10,000 &s;ailors, would by no means &s;ubdue us. We can rai&s;e five to one again&s;t this number. And &s;hould Britain call in foreign aid, as &s;he mu&s;t if &s;he does any thing to purpo&s;e; that would induce us to do the &s;ame. And &s;hould we make application, we could &s;oon have &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that Britain could not prevail again&s;t us.</P>
<P><HI>Second Argument.</HI> If we declare for In|dependency, Britain will not for time to come, protect us again&s;t other nations, and we &s;hould in time, and probably very &s;oon, become a prey to the French or Spaniards, or &s;ome other enemy.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> If we were once Independent, it would be the intere&s;t of all the European nations to keep us &s;o. They would not let
<PB N="17" REF="014791_0016_0F94A8F0745049C8">
any one nation engro&s;s us and our trade, le&s;t &s;uch an acqui&s;ition &s;hould enable that nation to be too powerful for its neighbours. Thus &s;ome &s;mall &s;tates in Europe are kept independent. The trade to North America would be &s;uch a boon to &s;everal European nations, that neither of them would let it be engro&s;&s;ed, or us be much hurt by ano|ther.</P>
<P><HI>Third Argument.</HI> If we unite with Bri|tain, we may have our expences refunded, and recover damages for our lo&s;&s;es; but if we declare for independency, we &s;hall lo&s;e all.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> 1&s;t, It is not in the di&s;po&s;ition, or even in the power of Britain, to make good our damages. There are no &s;uch propo&s;als by them, or like to be, therefore it cannot be u&s;ed as an argument with any propriety. 2d, If Britain &s;hould con&s;ent to this, it would yet be much better for us to repair our own damages as well as we can, in a &s;tate of independency, than to have Britain repair them in a &s;tate of &s;ub|jection to her. In a few years, it would be as cheap to us, our expences would be &s;o much le&s;s, and our revenues &s;o much greater in a &s;tate of independency.</P>
<P><HI>Argument Fourth.</HI> Our independency would ruin Britain, and &s;urely we cannot
<PB N="18" REF="014791_0017_0F94A8F15AEC9FB8">
be &s;o cruel towards our Parent, though &s;he has dealt &s;omething hardly with us.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> 1&s;t, Notwith&s;tanding our in|dependency, we may trade with Britain as much, if not more than with any kingdom in Europe; and if &s;he will retrench her needle&s;s expences of placemen and pen&s;ion|ers, and the luxuries of the great, &s;he may yet &s;urvive. With a proper part of our trade, and a reformation of her manners, Britain may &s;ub&s;i&s;t as well as &s;ome other kingdoms in Europe. 2d, We may by treaty agree to help, and defend Britain up|on particular occa&s;ions, as need may require. 3d, If Britain is ruined, it is by her own mi&s;conduct, and we cannot help it. If &s;he is ruined, it is becau&s;e &s;he is ripe for ruin, and God's judgments mu&s;t come upon her; in which ca&s;e we ought to be di&s;united, if we can, and not connected with her.</P>
<P><HI>Argument Fifth.</HI> If we will not &s;ubmit to a reconciliation with Britain, &s;he will procure the French and Spaniards to join with her, to bring us into &s;ubjection, or de&s;troy us. Britain would grant part of tho&s;e provinces to the French and Spani|ards, as a reward for helping to &s;ubdue the remainder, rather than we &s;hould be inde|pendent. And &s;hould Britain grant this, the French and Spaniards would &s;oon help to conquer us.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="014791_0018_0F94A8F1DD4CB3B0"><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> 1&s;t, This is but a mere ima|gination, or rather a bug-bear to &s;care peo|ple that know no better. 2d, The French and Spaniards had much rather help Ame|rica again&s;t Britain, than Britain again&s;t America. 3d, It would be much better for the French and Spaniards to have Ame|rica independent, and they allowed a free trade with the whole continent, than for them to own a part of it, without a free trade. It would co&s;t them much to guard and defend their part, which would proba|bly be a bone of contention; whereas if we were independent, they would have the benefit of our trade without any co&s;t. 4th, Should France and Spain join with Britain again&s;t us, we &s;hould apply to Holland, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and other powers, which would bring on a general war in Europe, which would relieve us, &s;o that we might continue independent. 5th, Again&s;t all &s;uch imaginary evil and danger as this ar|gument &s;uppo&s;es, or any that may po&s;&s;ibly occur, we have this to &s;upport us, that our cau&s;e is good, and we have the Great Di&s;|po&s;er of all things to confide in, and apply to. We have not run pre&s;umptuou&s;ly into danger, nor are we propo&s;ing an independ|ency that is unju&s;t or unrea&s;onable. What we propo&s;e is the mo&s;t equitable, rational,
<PB N="20" REF="014791_0019_0F94A8F29676DEA8">
natural mode of civil government; mo&s;t adapted to an&s;wer the ends of government, according to the word of God. A govern|ment mo&s;t favourable to religion as well as liberty, and the natural rights of mankind. In this way we have abundant rea&s;on to think that God will &s;mile upon and ble&s;s us; will pro&s;per our equitable proceedings, and prevent the evils that earth or hell may devi&s;e again&s;t us.</P>
<P><HI>Argument Sixth.</HI> The Congre&s;s has late|ly applied to Britain, and petitioned for a reconciliation, and therefore if Britain com|plies with our propo&s;al, we cannot with honour and ju&s;tice refu&s;e to treat with her.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> 1&s;t, We may hold a treaty, and try to come to &s;ome proper agreement, as to trade; enter into a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, and yet maintain our independ|ence as to government. 2d, Our petition and offer of reconciliation, &s;hould be view|ed only upon condition, that Britain would redre&s;s our grievances, repeal &s;everal acts of parliament, and place us in as good a con|dition as we were in 1763, which mu&s;t imply making good our damages; which Britain is by no means likely to do. 3d, But the mo&s;t proper an&s;wer to this argu|ment is, that things are much altered &s;ince our petition la&s;t July, or the beginning of
<PB N="21" REF="014791_0020_0F94A8F353E4B278">
September, when it was offered to the King. If our petition had been complied with, it ought to have been complied with immediately. It was offered in a critical time, we were then in the utmo&s;t danger, be&s;et on all &s;ides. Since that time much of our precious blood has been &s;pilt; one of our be&s;t generals &s;lain, &s;everal large towns burnt, and others cannonaded, be&s;ide im|men&s;e co&s;t. If we were held by that offer of the Congre&s;s, it ought to have been im|mediately complied with, or at lea&s;t we &s;hould have been told that it would be con|&s;idered as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; that it &s;hould be laid before the parliament as &s;oon as they met. But in&s;tead of this, we were told that no an&s;wer would be given, and there was not a word of it in the King's &s;peech to the parliament, framed by the mini&s;try, nor an item of any reconciliation with the colonies; nothing but the &s;ame proce&s;s of fire and &s;word that we had been treated with. Yea afterward, when Governor Penn had been examined before the Hou&s;e of Lords, and the Duke of Richmond made a motion that the la&s;t petition from the Continental Congre&s;s, &s;hould be made a ba&s;is for a plan of accommodation; the mini&s;terial party oppo&s;ed it, and it was thrown out by 86 again&s;t 33. And if the
<PB N="22" REF="014791_0021_0F94A8F4CCA555D0">
petition is taken under con&s;ideration after all, it is by con&s;traint, not willingly; it is becau&s;e they find that providence has &s;miled upon us, and frowned upon them, and they know not how to accompli&s;h their cruel de|&s;igns as they propo&s;ed. And is there not all the rea&s;on in the world, that we &s;hould &s;ay that we cannot make the &s;ame offer now that we did eight months ago, and that we are not bound by the offer we then made. If A offers B a hor&s;e at a certain price, and B does not accept the offer, A has a right to withdraw it, and is not obliged to let B have the hor&s;e on the &s;ame terms any con&s;i|derable time after, e&s;pecially if circum|&s;tances are much altered in the mean time, and more e&s;pecially if the alteration is A's damage, by B's neglect to comply with A's offer at fir&s;t. This is our ca&s;e with Britain. We are therefore no way bound by the pe|tition we &s;ent la&s;t July.</P>
<P>I come now to offer the arguments for independency, and again&s;t our being under Briti&s;h government.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t Argument.</HI> By independency we &s;hall avoid tyranny, and oppre&s;&s;ion. If we &s;ubmit to Briti&s;h government, we &s;hall be continually cramped with Governors, and other officers appointed by the crown. All tho&s;e in authority over us, will be &s;uch as &s;uit the ambitious de&s;igns of Great Britain,
<PB N="23" REF="014791_0022_0F94A8F6B817AA38">
however contrary to our intere&s;t. If we are under Briti&s;h government, we can make no laws to our advantage, unle&s;s Britain views them &s;o, and they receive a &s;anction there. Not a new county can be formed, or choo&s;e repre&s;entatives without leave from home. If we are independent we may yearly choo&s;e &s;uch rulers as &s;uit us be&s;t; but if &s;ubject to Britain, we mu&s;t be under a King that comes by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, however unfit to rule, which is often the bane of government. If we choo&s;e our rulers an|nually, or once in three years, they are at the end of that time, again put on a level with their fellow &s;ubjects, and are liable to be called to an account for mal-admini&s;tra|tion, which is a great means of preventing mi&s;management when in power. But if the government is hereditary, we mu&s;t take the chief magi&s;trate as he is; &s;ometimes an infant, &s;ometimes with &s;carce common fen&s;e, &s;ometimes inattentive to any public bu&s;ine&s;s, like Domitian catching flies; &s;ome|times ambitious, fierce, and cruel, u&s;ing all the power of the nation, to promote tyranny; &s;ometimes a capricious woman; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Should one of our charter governments choo&s;e a girl, or an old woman for their governor, and give her the u&s;u|al &s;alary, would not their money be nobly expended, and their government finely managed! This among other things may &s;erve to &s;hew, that hereditary government cannot be founded in rea&s;on and equity.</NOTE>
<PB N="24" REF="014791_0023_0F94A8F78E76D9B0">
and however thus unfit to an&s;wer the true ends of government, he or &s;he, is not to be &s;et a&s;ide. Hereditary government tends to keep a continual oppo&s;ition between the court and the country: So that a courtier and a patriot are oppo&s;ite characters, which is the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity in nature, if the de|&s;ign of civil government is properly viewed. Rulers are, or ought to be wholly for the good of the people: But how contrary to this, is the ca&s;e in fact, in many in&s;tances! The court and the patriots in continual op|po&s;ition, has long time been a reproach to a nation that boa&s;ts of liberty, and the be&s;t form of civil government. What &s;ay &s;crip|ture and rea&s;on? If a kingdom, or an hou&s;e be divided again&s;t it&s;elf, it cannot &s;tand. Every man that has lived any time in Ame|rica, under regal government, knows what frequent, and almo&s;t continual oppo&s;ition there is between the country intere&s;t and tho&s;e in power; what jars and contentions between Governors and A&s;&s;emblies, &amp;c. This may be prevented by keeping clear of Briti&s;h government; and a kind Providence &s;eems now to open a door for it. I have but imperfectly exhibited this argument; but our oppre&s;&s;ions, and the incroachments upon our natural rights by regal officers, are &s;o well known to every man that has
<PB N="25" REF="014791_0024_0F94A8F7D70860A8">
any acquaintance with our public affairs, that I need not enlarge.</P>
<P><HI>Second Argument.</HI> By being indepen|dent, we &s;hall be much le&s;s expo&s;ed to fo|reign wars. Every large kingdom is often at war with neighbouring nations. The avarice, and ambition of a Prince, at the head of a powerful nation, will not &s;uffer it to be long at peace. If we belong to a large kingdom in Europe, we mu&s;t be at war whenever that kingdom is at war: And &s;ome part of America will always be expo&s;ed in time of war. But if we are in|dependent, it will be the intere&s;t of all the European nations to keep us &s;o, and no one of them will view us as enemies, becau&s;e they are at war among them&s;elves. Holland often enjoys peace while the neighbouring kingdoms are at war. If we are indepen|dent all the nations of Europe will protect and keep us &s;o; for rea&s;ons that have be|fore been given. This will be much bet|ter than to be under the protection of any one, tho' the mo&s;t powerful nation in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Third Argument.</HI> If we are independent, our taxes will be incon&s;iderable, compared with what they will and mu&s;t be, if we are under regal government. A view of the public expences in the Province of
<PB N="26" REF="014791_0025_0F94A8F89558EF70">
New-York, and the Colony of Connecti|cut, a few years pa&s;t, may &s;erve to evince this. If we are under regal government, the Provinces will be dealt out to hungry officers, who will always get what they can. There are &s;o many hangers-on at the Briti&s;h court, who want places; &s;o many reduced gentlemen to be &s;upplied; &s;o many placemen and pen&s;ioners, that we &s;hall al|ways be peeled and pillaged, and new me|thods of rai&s;ing revenues invented to &s;up|ply them. A number of &s;uch hungry creatures will always be gaping for the places of profit and honor, and their &s;alaries mu&s;t be as large as po&s;&s;ible. But if our principal officers were annually cho&s;en from among our&s;elves, the expences would be incon&s;iderable, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of govern|ment much better done. There are many ways more than I can enumerate, by which our public expences would be encrea&s;ed un|der regal government, and dimini&s;hed by being independent.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth Argument.</HI> It will be much ea&s;ier to &s;ettle the pre&s;ent di&s;putes by declaring for independency, than by attempting an accomodation. Should an accomodation be attempted, the views of Britain and America are &s;o very different, if not dia|metrically oppo&s;ite, that they could not be
<PB N="27" REF="014791_0026_0F94A8F98F47E938">
made to harmonize. The demands of Britain and America would cla&s;h to &s;uch a degree, as to render a reconciliation imprac|ticable. America would in&s;i&s;t upon &s;o many Acts of Parliament being repealed, &s;o many rights and privileges a&s;certained, &s;uch a reparation of damages, &amp;c. many, or all of which things the court of Great-Britain would ab&s;olutely refu&s;e, that an ac|commodation could not take place.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth Argument.</HI> If matters are &s;ettled by our being independent, the Continental Congre&s;s, or the managers of that affair, will be relieved of much difficulty and ac|quitted with honor; otherwi&s;e it is likely they will be &s;u&s;pected of bribery, and loaded with blame and reproach. If a reconcili|ation is po&s;&s;ible, and &s;hould take place, there mu&s;t probably be &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions on the part of America, as would be very grating to multitudes. And tho&s;e that were entru&s;ted with the management of the affair, would probably be &s;u&s;pected of bri|bery, whether guilty or not. If matters are not &s;ettled to the &s;atisfaction of people in general, the tran&s;actors of the affair will be the objects of much public odium. Some part of the Continent has &s;uffered &s;o much, is &s;o irritated by cruel treatment, and there is now &s;uch a pro&s;pect of &s;ettling
<PB N="28" REF="014791_0027_0F94A8FA1422C130">
things well by independency, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to make people think well of the men that &s;hall, without ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity, again &s;ubject us to Briti&s;h govern|ment. No man need de&s;ire to be a mem|ber of that Congre&s;s, that &s;hall again bring America into &s;ubjection to Great-Britain, if it is not the general voice of the country.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth Argument.</HI> If we are indepen|dent, we &s;hall be le&s;s liable to internal tu|mults and rebellions. Our people have now &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of liberty; have been &s;o u&s;ed to meet, form, and publi&s;h re&s;olves, and a&s;&s;ert their rights and privileges, and have &s;o well &s;ucceeded in our pre&s;ent con|te&s;t with Britain, that it will be very diffi|cult to prevent &s;omething &s;imilar for time to come, if they are put under Briti&s;h go|vernment; e&s;pecially if they think it is without nece&s;&s;ity, and contrary to their na|tural rights. Should there now be a patched up reconciliation, and we in &s;ubjection to Great-Britain, we might expect nothing but inward convul&s;ions, &s;truggles, and at|tempts for freedom, till we were either ruined or &s;et free.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh Argument.</HI> If we are indepen|dent, this land of liberty will be glorious on many accounts: Population will abun|dantly increa&s;e, agriculture will be promot|ed,
<PB N="29" REF="014791_0028_0F94A8FBD8A09C78">

What a dreadful ab&s;urdity! What a &s;hocking con&s;ideration, that people who are &s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly contending for liberty, &s;hould at the &s;ame time en|courage and promote &s;lavery! And being thus guilty, ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to the judgments of Heaven! May &s;lavery cea&s;e in America!

<P>I have thus briefly &s;tated &s;ome of the ar|guments, for and again&s;t a reconciliation with Great-Britain: More might be pro|duced, and I doubt not will occur to every reader.&mdash;The&s;e matters are now exerci&s;ing the thoughts of many among us. America's
<PB N="30" REF="014791_0029_0F94A8FDC979FAC8">
reconciliation with Britain is become a &s;ub|ject of conver&s;ation, and I think ought to be impartially canva&s;&s;ed. In canva&s;&s;ing this matter, and bringing things forward to a determination, the &s;ide of reconciliation with Britain has con&s;iderable advantage; becau&s;e many men in office, and tho&s;e that hope to be promoted if a union takes place, will exert them&s;elves, u&s;e all the plau&s;ible arguments and per&s;ua&s;ions they can, to lead people to think a union is be&s;t; and many of tho&s;e are men that people have been u&s;ed to view as leaders and head men, to whom they have often applied for ad|vice. Many men now in power, and others who hope to come into places of profit or honour, will from intere&s;ted views, u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to lead people in general, to think that a reconci|liation with Britain is be&s;t. And it is ea&s;y for them to influence and lead many of the populous.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since I wrote the above, I have been told, that there are in almo&s;t every county if not town, men employed, and even hired by tho&s;e who call them&s;elves friends to government, to per&s;uade and influence people as much as po&s;&s;ible, to favour and promote a reconciliation with Great Britain. People therefore in general thro' the country, &s;hould ob&s;erve what &s;ort of men are engaged to promote a reconciliation with Britain; whether they be &s;uch as ex|pect favour from government, or whether they be &s;uch as act with a di&s;intere&s;ted regard to the good of the country.</NOTE> On the contrary the &s;ide of

<HEAD>THE PLAN OF AN AMERICAN COMPACT, WITH GREAT-BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fir&s;t Publi&s;hed at NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE capital &s;ubject of conver&s;ation throughout America for the&s;e few weeks pa&s;t, hath been excited by a Pamphlet, entitled, Common Sen&s;e; the author of which endeavours to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of our final &s;eparation from Great-Britain, as our rights and privileges cannot be properly &s;ecured by any mode of recon|ciliation whatever. None of the an&s;wers given to this ingenious Pamphlet, have &s;ketched out any plan of &s;ettlement, by which it might appear that our rights and freedom would be fully &s;ecured, though again united and harmonized with Britain. That &s;uch a compact or &s;ettlement is prac|ticable, I think ought to be made apparent to the people of America, before they can be convinced of the propriety of reconcilia|tion;
<PB N="34" REF="014791_0033_0F94A901119CCA00">
and unle&s;s this can be effected, I never wi&s;h to &s;ee the union; preferring, beyond all compari&s;on, the toils and dan|gers of erecting a free and independent fa|brick to the delu&s;ive promi&s;es of freedom, pregnant with the principles of &s;ervitude and oppre&s;&s;ion. But, I think, &s;uch a compact, or act of &s;ettlement, may be framed, as will &s;ecure to Americans the rights of freemen, at the &s;ame time that it removes from them the horrors of war, and the de&s;olations with which even victory mu&s;t be attended. I think no con&s;iderate per&s;on will deny, that our truly honorable Congre&s;s were of opinion &s;uch a compact could be formed, when they petitioned the King, addre&s;&s;ed the people of Britain, and prayed to the Father of peace for reconci|liation with Great-Britain, as the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing the&s;e colonies could enjoy. If &s;uch a &s;ettlement, in the opinion of the Congre&s;s could &s;o lately have been framed, I think no good rea&s;on can be given why it cannot now be effected, &s;ince the &s;ame wi&s;e and &s;alutary regulations, which &s;ix months ago would have &s;ecured us again&s;t the inroads of tyranny and the de&s;igns of a wicked Mini&s;try, mu&s;t at this day an&s;wer the &s;ame important purpo&s;es.

mu&s;t have thought would be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure our liberties, I do not know, it is impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, for me to relate them; but &s;ufficient it is, for the purpo&s;e of de|&s;troying the foundation of independency, to delineate the outlines of a compact, which would reconcile us to Great-Britain, and at the &s;ame time &s;ecure and pre&s;erve our rights and privileges: Such a general plan, or ground-work, is here offered to the public for their con&s;ideration.</P>

<P><HI>Fifth.</HI> As it is nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be &s;ome general power to &s;uperintend and regulate the intere&s;t of the colonies as con|nected with and interfering with each other, which no Provincial legi&s;lature is competent to; and as it would be danger|ous to give the Briti&s;h Parliament that pow|er lea&s;t tyranny might enter in at &s;o indefi|nite a pa&s;&s;age, there &s;hould be a general Convention, con&s;i&s;ting of Deputies from the &s;everal colony A&s;&s;emblies, or from the people, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be to regulate the po&s;ts, the general currency, and the proportion of the forces of the colonies, and all other matters in which the &s;eparate colony legi&s;latures have not &s;ufficient autho|rity,
<PB N="37" REF="014791_0036_0F94A9026BF18AD0">
and which are not contrary to the right herein allowed to the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment. One &s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s of this conven|tion, &s;hould be to keep a vigilant and careful watch over the de&s;igns and tran&s;actions of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try and Parliament, that &s;o by an early watch word it may prevent tyranny in its embrio: But as ab&s;olute power might in time be a&s;&s;umed by this Congre&s;s, were it without any check, its acts therefore &s;hould go home for the Royal a&s;&s;ent; the Crown to have no power to re|ject them, or the Provincial acts, unle&s;s done within three years after pa&s;&s;ing here.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth.</HI> For our &s;ecurity again&s;t the intro|duction of Briti&s;h troops to en&s;lave us in times of tranquillity, when we had forgot the u&s;e of arms, a perpetual &s;tanding mili|tia bill &s;hould form part of the compact by which means the people of the colonies would keep up their martial &s;pirit, and al|ways be prepared again&s;t the attack of ar|bitrary power: But, as it would be u&s;eful, in ca&s;e of &s;udden inva&s;ion, to have a &s;mall number of troops at all times ready to repel &s;uch inva&s;ion, the King &s;hould have a right to &s;end a certain limited number, for in&s;tance, 10 or 12,000 upon the Conti|nent, who&s;e immediate exertions might be
<PB N="38" REF="014791_0037_0F94A9031DB97770">
&s;ufficient to prevent an enemy, until the militia could be a&s;&s;embled and brought up. Whoever a&s;&s;erts that 10 or 12,000 &s;oldiers would be &s;ufficient to controul the militia of this continent, con&s;i&s;ting of 500,000 brave men, pays but a de&s;picable compli|ment to the &s;pirit and ability of Ameri|cans. More than this &s;tipulated number the Crown &s;hould not &s;end without the con&s;ent of the general Convention or Con|gre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh.</HI> In order to prevent bribery and corruption from &s;apping the foundation of the goodly fabrick, the compact &s;hould contain the&s;e three clau&s;es, viz. That the Colonies &s;hould choo&s;e their Repre&s;entatives and Convention every two years: That they &s;hould choo&s;e them by ballot; and that no officer or pen&s;ionary of the Crown &s;hould be elected.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth.</HI> As the&s;e colonies would be pro|tected by the power of Britain, and would receive all the duties ari&s;ing from the regu|lation of trade, the Colonies &s;hould &s;tipu|late to allow them 8 per cent. upon all merchandizes imported from foreign coun|tries. This would be the ea&s;ie&s;t of all me|thods for rai&s;ing this &s;um; It would be
<PB N="39" REF="014791_0038_0F94A903D9622758">
paid invi&s;ibly, and we &s;hould even then be gainers, &s;ince we &s;hould receive a profit of 12 per cent. upon &s;uch foreign commodities. If the exigencies of the &s;tate &s;hould at any time require a further grant, the &s;ame &s;hould be obtained freely by way of requi&s;ition.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the outlines of the compact of reconciliation, by which it is apparent our freedom may be amply &s;ecured. No doubt many additions may be made to it by the wi&s;dom of our venerable Congre&s;s, and the ob&s;ervations of my countrymen. And &s;ince an honorable and &s;ecure harmony may again be e&s;tabli&s;hed between Great-Britain and the&s;e Colonies, who would prefer the horrors of war, the ruin of commerce, the de&s;truction of private peace and happine&s;s, and the lo&s;s of thou|&s;ands of our countrymen in battle, to the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and tranquillity, the en|joyment of plenty and abundance, the pre|&s;ervation of the lives of our fellow creatures, and all the&s;e in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty? And for what are we to encounter all the&s;e evils, and untried ways, which like all novel experiments, mu&s;t be attend|ed with innumerable difficulties, if they &s;hould happen to prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and
<PB N="40" REF="014791_0039_0F94A904C8874DC8">
with di&s;mal con&s;equences &s;hould they mi&s;carry. 'Tis a form of government which Baron Monte&s;quieu, and the be&s;t writers on the &s;ubject, have &s;hewn to be attended with many mi&s;chiefs and imper|fections, while they pa&s;s high encomiums on the excellency of the Briti&s;h con&s;tituti|on. But why &s;hould I dwell upon the dangers of this &s;cheme; the Continental Congre&s;s have never li&s;ped the lea&s;t de&s;ire for independency or republicani&s;m: all their publications breathe another &s;pirit, and in their ju&s;tice, wi&s;dom and virtue I can freely confide, for a re&s;toration of peace and tranquillity upon ju&s;t and honorable conditions.</P>
