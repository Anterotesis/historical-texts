<HEAD>LETTER I. MORTIMER TO CAROLINE.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR affectionate &s;olicitude, my amiable Caro|line, merits every return that grateful tender|ne&s;s and fraternal love can make; and the heart of Mor|timer offers you its warme&s;t acknowledgments.</P>
<P>The long ab&s;ence of which you &s;o pathetically com|plain, ari&s;es from no common event, but all your con|jectures are ill-founded.&mdash; It is no mi&s;placed attach|ment that makes me thus long a &s;tranger to my native &s;pot: it is no de&s;tructive infatuation which I am &s;o re|luctant to avow; it is&mdash;and why &s;hould the heart of virtue blu&s;h to confe&s;s it?&mdash;the impul&s;e of generous &s;en|&s;ibility.</P>
<P>You &s;mile, my penetrating &s;i&s;ter; modern &s;en&s;ibility has been the frequent &s;ubject of my &s;atyric powers; but it has been that &s;uperficial impo&s;tor, the offspring of pride and artifice, cheri&s;hed by the undi&s;tingui&s;hing ap|plau&s;e of vulgarity, that I have derided; the genuine effu&s;ions of a &s;en&s;ible and benevolent &s;pirit I have al|ways revered. With me the plaintive voice of unaf|fected &s;orrow has ever been &s;acred: and the errors of humanity have never failed to find an indulgent advocate in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>This hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion, my dear Caroline, is but the prelude to a tale of woe, which may, I think, convey a

le&s;&s;on of u&s;eful in&s;truction, guard you again&s;t the delu&s;ions of the heart, and, by the irre&s;i&s;tible power of truth, teach you to vanqui&s;h immorality, &s;hould it eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dare to approach you.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had tran&s;acted the bu&s;ine&s;s that brought me hither, I had adieu to the family of our worthy friend, and hired apartments in a neighbouring &s;ea|port town, re&s;olved to &s;ee every thing worthy the atten|tion of a curious traveller in this part of the world. In this pur&s;uit I &s;pent &s;ome time very agreeably, when, return|ing one evening from a plea&s;urable excur&s;ion, I found, in addition to the &s;ociety I had left on going out, a young hand&s;ome military officer, and a mo&s;t attractive elegant lady, who were, I was informed, united in the mo&s;t &s;acred of all bands, and purpo&s;ed to fix their re&s;i|dence in that place during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. The engaging emanations of exalted mode&s;ty, good &s;en&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eep &s;en&s;i|bility, and plaintive &s;oftne&s;s, in the <HI>tout-en&s;emble</HI> of the lady, &s;oon intere&s;ted me in her favour: and I wi&s;hed to know if the form and manners, &s;o calculated to charm, were faithful emblems of as lovely a mind. To this end I a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated the acquaintance of the captain; he &s;eemed flattered by my attentions, and a &s;hort time produced an exce&s;s of &s;ociability. I laughed, drank, &s;ung, &s;moaked, and boa&s;ted of gallantry with him; and &s;ometimes talked &s;entimentally with his fair partner, the enchanting Ela. I re&s;olved to &s;pare no pains to di&s;cover the native qualities of her &s;oul, and &s;oon found it was too perfect to need any di&s;gui&s;e. Her lan|guage was that of virtue, adorned by the graces: every &s;entiment &s;he uttered &s;eemed the &s;pontaneous effu&s;ions of an enlightened and elevated mind, and was worthy of being immortali&s;ed; yet, in the mid&s;t of apparent happine&s;s, a &s;udden cloud of tender melancholy would ari&s;e, which in vain I endeavoured to penetrate. It often cro&s;&s;ed her features without any apparent cau&s;e, but generally vani&s;hed in &s;ome benevolent or affection|ate effu&s;ion. In love as in every other gentle and ge|nerous &s;en&s;ation of the heart, I di&s;covered her to be a perfect enthu&s;ia&s;t. A &s;tranger to every lukewarm im|pul&s;e, her expre&s;&s;ive eyes beamed unutterable tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="3" REF="021723_0006_0FB7408435FE7AB0">
on the object of her choice, and frequently re|garded him with a kind of &s;oft anxiety for which all my penetration was unable fully to account; but I thought I traced indifference, and &s;ometimes more ungentle di&s;|po&s;itions in <HI>his</HI> a&s;pect and behaviour. How often, when ob&s;erving the impa&s;&s;ioned attachment that evinced it&s;elf in all her looks, words, and actions, directed to him, have I appealed to the &s;earcher of hearts, whether there was in exi&s;tence a being capable of injuring &s;o much ex|cellence? But I did not long wait for a di&s;covery that brought the fulle&s;t conviction.</P>
<P>Having been ab&s;ent near a fortnight on a vi&s;it to a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who, finding in me a ta&s;te and &s;entiment congenial with his own, had given me repeated invitations to his hou&s;e, I returned to my former habitation, de&s;igning to bid adieu to my newly acquired friends, and turn my thoughts and wi&s;hes to|ward home. But how was I amazed and &s;hocked on en|tering the hou&s;e, where I had &s;o lately left them in ap|parent happine&s;s, to find the amiable Ela alone, de|&s;erted, expo&s;ed among unfeeling &s;trangers, to all the horrors of poverty, and the mo&s;t poignant angui&s;h of heart! Pale and dejected &s;he aro&s;e at my entrance, fixed her &s;wimming eyes on my face, and reading the language of my heart, bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ionate effu&s;ion of wo, and was retiring. I could not &s;peak&mdash;but &s;eizing her hand, as &s;he was about to leave me, &s;he looked at me with an expre&s;&s;ion that will be forever engraved on my remembrance, and, &s;inking into a chair by my &s;ide, endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s her emotions.&mdash; Mine, I believe, were little le&s;s violent&mdash;Pity entire|ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my &s;oul; and &s;hall I own it, my Caroline? &mdash;the unmanly tear bedewed the hand of the lovely &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>Again, &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, beaming with gratitude through the deepe&s;t gloom of &s;orrow, and pre&s;&s;ing my hand to her agitated heart&mdash;"Noble &s;tranger!" &s;he exclaimed&mdash;"Do you weep for my &s;ufferings?&mdash;A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as! you know not how little I merit &s;uch generous &s;ympathy, &s;uch exalted goodne&s;s!"</P>
<P>"I know," replied I, "that you are unhappy&mdash;
<PB N="4" REF="021723_0007_0FB74091B4B12E78">
and is not that enough?" "Enough!"&mdash;repeated &s;he, with emotion&mdash;"Yes," I added, "and I likewi&s;e believe you are truly amiable."</P>
<P>"Then you are mi&s;taken," interrupted &s;he, with ex|treme energy&mdash;"I am not&mdash;Indeed I am not! &mdash;I do not merit your friend&s;hip&mdash;nor can I dare to de|ceive you &mdash;Oh! I am lo&s;t! lo&s;t for ever!"&mdash;&s;he cla&s;ped her hands in agony. "But your unexampled greatne&s;s of &s;oul," added &s;he, "merits more than I can &s;ay: and truth and &s;incerity is the only acknowledgment in my power.&mdash;Yes &s;ir,"&mdash;&s;aid &s;he, again ri&s;ing, "you &s;hall know who &s;he is who&s;e &s;orrows you thus conde&s;cend to regard;&mdash;and for your &s;ake, I will yet believe, that vir|tue re&s;ides among the &s;ons of men."</P>
<P>With tho&s;e words &s;he darted out of the room, leaving me in a &s;tate of mind to which no language can do ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>My &s;teps turned involuntarily after her, when the ap|pearance of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e convinced me of an error, and I accompanied her back into the par|lour.</P>
<P>"Ah! &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, as we entered, "here has been &s;ad doings &s;ince you left us&mdash;Well&mdash;who could think that &s;uch a hand&s;ome gentleman and &s;uch a fine lady would turn out &s;o!&mdash;Why the captain is a downright rogue, &s;ir&mdash;and his wife, as he called her, is no better" &mdash;"Oh!"&mdash;interrupted I,&mdash;"you &s;hould not &s;o readily believe injurious reports.&mdash;I dare &s;ay it is no more than &s;ome little temporary derangement which has been greatly exaggerated: or, perhaps, entirely mi&s;repre|&s;ented."</P>
<P>"No, no Sir," replied the woman, "'tis too true&mdash; Why the lady expo&s;ed her&s;elf&mdash;Trouble, like children, generally &s;peaks truth.&mdash;Not but I pity the poor thing; and yet I'm loo&s;er enough by them already; &s;o if &s;he can't pay what is due, I mu&s;t &s;top all I can, and &s;he mu&s;t not think of &s;taying here to &s;punge upon an hone&s;t woman."</P>
<P>"But you &s;urely would not turn her out into the &s;treet!" exclaimed I.&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is nothing to me, &s;ir, where &s;he goes,"&mdash;return|ed
<PB N="5" REF="021723_0008_0FB7409335C9AB28">
&s;he&mdash;"but I know &s;he &s;han't take up my hou&s;e-room and eat my victuals any longer, and &s;o I am going to tell her."</P>
<P>"Stop!"&mdash;cried I, as &s;he opened the door to put her cruel threats in execution &mdash;"Would you di&s;tre&s;s the wretched?"</P>
<P>"No;"&mdash;&s;he replied&mdash; "nor they &s;han't di&s;tre&s;s me."</P>
<P>"Hear me then," added I,&mdash;"I will be an&s;werable for every expence of this unfortunate lady."</P>
<P>"Well to be &s;ure, you're a generous gentleman,"&mdash; &s;aid the woman with a malignant &s;neer, "and the lo&s;s of one is often the gain of two."</P>
<P>I paid no regard to her in&s;olence, but depo&s;iting a bill of twenty pounds in her hand to prove the &s;incerity of my words, earne&s;tly de&s;ired that her amiable charge might be treated with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect and attention: and again a&s;&s;uring her of an ample reward, begged &s;he would take to her&s;elf all the merit &s;he might fancy there was in this conduct;&mdash;nor ever let the &s;ecret pa&s;s her lips, as &s;he expected the performance of my promi&s;e.</P>
<P>With this injunction &s;he readily acquie&s;ced: and I left her, &s;oothed by the magic power of gold into the mo&s;t engaging benignity.</P>
<P>Con&s;oled by the &s;weet a&s;&s;urance of having gratified a laudable impul&s;e, I retired to my apartment, and was buried in a labyrinth of conjecture relative to the un|happy Ela&mdash;when the woman of the hou&s;e tapped at my door, and reque&s;ted to &s;peak with me.</P>
<P>"The lady," &s;aid &s;he, in a tone of alarm&mdash;"has fa&s;tened her door, and ob&s;tinately refu&s;es to an&s;wer me."</P>
<P>A dreadful fear cro&s;&s;ed my mind, and, without mak|ing any reply, I ha&s;tily followed her with trembling &s;teps.</P>
<P>After trying every gentle means to procure admi&s;&s;ion without &s;ucce&s;s, I acquie&s;ced in the expedience of u&s;ing forcible mea&s;ures, and the door was broke open.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with terrible apprehen&s;ions I entered the room, and beheld the cau&s;e of my di&s;quietude &s;tretch|ed on the carpet with death marked on her features. Unmindful of vulgar cen&s;ure I threw my&s;elf be&s;ide her,
<PB N="6" REF="021723_0009_0FB74094B9C17238">
and mourned her lot, fully a&s;&s;ured that her &s;oul had taken its irrevocable flight. But I was &s;oon mo&s;t joy|fully undeceived. The people around me declared &s;he was only in a fit, and a few minutes confirmed the truth of their a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The recollection of her mi&s;ery ru&s;hed like a torrent on her mind; and fixing her eloquent eyes on my face, &s;he enquired, why I had &s;uffered them to bring her back?&mdash;</P>
<P>"That we may all unite our endeavours to render you happy," I replied,&mdash;"Happy!" echoed &s;he, with a gloomy &s;mile&mdash;"You know but little of the heart of Ela." As &s;he uttered the&s;e words her eyes met tho&s;e of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the man&s;ion&mdash;and, &s;tarting wildly from me, &s;he exclaimed, "What, and is that woman too come to render me happy! O, righteous Heaven, why am I reduced to be the &s;port of abject cruelty!&mdash;But think not, worthy &s;tranger," added &s;he&mdash;"that I ungratefully cla&s;s you among the unfeeling herd; O, no, the wretched Ela can yet di&s;tingui&s;h &s;uch as you&mdash;your goodne&s;s is writ|ten here,"&mdash;pointing to her bo&s;om&mdash;"in indelible cha|racters.&mdash;Yes, and it is written likewi&s;e on a table that corruption cannot de&s;troy; where I, perhaps, may con|template it when this poor form is mouldered into du&s;t: and where,"&mdash;added &s;he, with an air of mild, yet mo&s;t commanding dignity,&mdash;"I may forget too how that wo|man" (again fixing her eye on the aba&s;hed offender) "has dared to in&s;ult me."</P>
<P>"Me in&s;ult you!" cried the woman, whlie anger and &s;hame &s;pread their &s;anguine emblems, over her features&mdash; How can you &s;ay, Mi&s;s, as how I ever in&s;ulted you&mdash; I'm &s;ure your're very &s;piteful, and"&mdash;</P>
<P>I found &s;he was about to enlarge&mdash;and therefore ex|erting all my authoritative powers to awe her into &s;ilence, they happily produced &s;uch an effect, that muttering &s;ome unintelligible jargon, &s;he quitted the room.</P>
<P>"I refu&s;ed to admit that woman into my apartment, Sir," (&s;aid the gentle mourner, addre&s;&s;ing me)&mdash;"be|cau&s;e &s;he has u&s;ed an in&s;olence of language to which no misfortune &s;hall ever make me ba&s;e enough to &s;ubmit;&mdash; but when I heard your friendly voice at the door, grati|tude

bur&s;t on my oppre&s;&s;ed &s;oul, and unequal to the con|flict, I &s;unk into in&s;en&s;ibility."</P>
<P>I entreated her ardently to endeavour to forget all that could di&s;turb her repo&s;e, and ventured to palliate the mi&s;conduct of the landlady: who was, I &s;incerely a&s;&s;ur|ed her, fully &s;en&s;ible and a&s;hamed of her behaviour: and would not, I was convinced, in a cooler moment, &s;cruple to own &s;he had erred.</P>
<P>"I neither wi&s;h, nor am intitled to &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion, Sir," &s;he calmly replied. "Perhaps I am more unju&s;t in re&s;enting than &s;he is in giving offence: &s;o let it be re|membered no more."</P>
<P>She laid her head on the pillow, &s;aying, that &s;orrow weighed down her eyelids, and &s;leep would, in her pre|&s;ent &s;tate, be an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing. Con&s;idering this as an intimation that &s;he wi&s;hed to be alone, I beckoned the &s;ervants to withdraw, and retired wi&s;hing that every gentle influence might de&s;cend to give her comfort, and effectually &s;often the angui&s;h of her heart.</P>
<P>The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e met me as I de&s;cended the &s;tairs. Anger &s;till &s;parkled in her eye, and &s;he began an harangue about the lady's unforgiving temper, and her own wrongs and eminent virtues:&mdash;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eighing mo&s;t bitterly again&s;t the captain, and honouring him, I be|lieve very ju&s;tly, with every opprobrious epithet that in|vention could &s;ugge&s;t; but I found means to allay the bitterne&s;s of her re&s;entment, and make her accompany me amicably to the parlour, where &s;he related all that &s;he knew re&s;pecting the unfortunate Ela. That the cap|tain di&s;appeared the day after I quitted them on the ex|cur&s;ion before mentioned, and all their efforts had proved in&s;ufficient to di&s;cover his retreat; that the lady in the angui&s;h of her heart, occa&s;ioned by this de&s;ertion, had avowed her&s;elf the victim of enthu&s;ia&s;tic love&mdash;and prov|ed that the de&s;tructive flame &s;till lived in her heart, by execrating her own folly rather than his ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e unguarded expre&s;&s;ions it was that gave ri&s;e to the treatment &s;he had experienced, and &s;truck &s;o forcibly on her heart.&mdash;But we are well convinced, by ob&s;erva|tion, that a generous indulgence to the imperfections of mortality mu&s;t not be expected from groveling minds.&mdash;
<PB N="8" REF="021723_0011_0FB74097A03BC908">
True &s;ympathy is the &s;pontaneous growth of elevated &s;ouls&mdash;and not to be met with in common walks of life.</P>
<P>The conduct of the landlady was con&s;i&s;tent with her character, and &s;trictly natural.&mdash;It therefore, my dear &s;i&s;ter, contains this u&s;eful le&s;&s;on, that it is in general certainly a point of wi&s;dom to conceal our &s;orrows; as by expo&s;ing them, we only expo&s;e our&s;elves to the con|tempt and deri&s;ion of the bulk of mankind.&mdash;Sometimes, indeed, we meet with a di&s;tingui&s;hing and generous &s;pi|rit;&mdash;but let us not too ea&s;ily believe the &s;oft per&s;ua&s;ive voice, the gently-&s;oothing accent, or even the tear-fraught eye.&mdash;All the&s;e, experience teaches us, are ea&s;ily, and, I fear, very frequently a&s;&s;umed to gild the &s;erpent's heart; and, by throwing us off our guard, precipitate us the more readily into the &s;nares of the de&s;igning. Let di&s;cretion then always mark the bounds of confidence. &mdash;Let us remember one of the be&s;t approved maxims of the wi&s;e&s;t of men, and, by keeping a bridle on our tongue, guard our&s;elves again&s;t the dangers of credulity.</P>
<P>You will laugh in the gaiety of your heart, and call this preaching.&mdash;Be it &s;o&mdash;The &s;ermon flowed un&s;tudied from my pen, and why &s;hould I &s;uppre&s;s a thought that may eventually contribute in the &s;malle&s;t degree to the welfare and happine&s;s of my Caroline?</P>
<P>But your amiable impatience to know more of the in|jured Ela, I am well a&s;&s;ured, far out&s;trips the pen of the readie&s;t writer. Hence then digre&s;&s;ion. Your curio&s;ity is the offspring of the virtues, and merits every gratifica|tion and indulgence.</P>
<P>The immediate con&s;equence of Ela's exqui&s;ite &s;ufferings was a dangerous fever.&mdash;Her life was de&s;paired of, and I was the con&s;tant attendant of her couch. Death &s;eemed the ble&s;&s;ing to which all her wi&s;hes a&s;pired;&mdash;but her prayers were rejected. The cup of her &s;orrows was not full. She was re&s;erved, no doubt, for &s;ome wi&s;e purpo&s;e; and youth triumphed over the con&s;uming fires of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">read|ful di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>WHY will the mo&s;t exalted of mankind &s;till conti|nue to participate in the &s;orrows of a wretched girl?</P>
<P>You have been a mini&s;tering angel appointed to re|deem me from the power of death, and whi&s;per peace to the bo&s;om of de&s;pair: and let that &s;uffice; no longer per&s;ecute your generous heart by attempting what is im|practicable.

<P>AFTER deeply revolving on the contents of Ela's affecting letter, I concluded her reque&s;t, of being left
<PB N="11" REF="021723_0014_0FB740ADB8AF5E28">
to the quiet enjoyment of unmole&s;ted &s;olitude, too ju&s;t and rea&s;onable to be rejected;&mdash;and di&s;patching an an|&s;wer, where, in addition to many adieus, was &s;ome well-meant council; I ventured to inclo&s;e an incon&s;iderable proof of my friend&s;hip, that might, in ca&s;e of unfore|&s;een exigencies, enable her to bid defiance to ab&s;olute penury. I then di&s;charged every obligation to her cour|teous ho&s;te&s;s, and my wi&s;hes &s;prang forward to the dear haunt of our nativity, and my &s;till dearer Caroline; from who&s;e loved &s;ociety I have been &s;o long e&s;tranged. But the fir&s;t place at which I &s;topped for refre&s;hment, taking up a new&s;paper that accidentally lay on the ta|ble, I read the following paragraph:</P>
<Q><TEXT>

<DIV1 TYPE="newspaper article">
<OPENER><DATELINE>"SOUTHAMPTON.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>"It is confidently a&s;&s;erted here, that the celebrated widow Barrymore is on the point of &s;acrificing her in|numerable captives on the altar of Hymen; and that the cau&s;e of this wonderful conver&s;ion from the deluding path of gallantry, is a young and elegant Hibernian; who, in addition to the charms of a fine per&s;on, an in&s;inu|ating tongue, and military graces, is de&s;cended from a race, who&s;e heroic deeds are immortali&s;ed in the annals of his country both in peace and war; and who will, we doubt not, find ample compen&s;ation for the trammels of matrimony in the trebled jointure of the elegant widow."</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>It in&s;tantly occurred to me, on peru&s;ing this curious piece of intelligence, that this fortunate Hibernian was the lover of Ela. Fully impre&s;&s;ed with this belief, I re&s;olved to vi&s;it Southampton, and, putting wings to my &s;peed, reached it in a few days.&mdash;In the fir&s;t hou&s;e of public re&s;ort that I entered, I beheld my old acquain|tance fluttering among the gay ones of the age; with all the a&s;&s;urance of triumphant villainy.</P>
<P>My &s;pirit ro&s;e indignant at the &s;ight&mdash;his eyes glan|ced towards me, a guilty flu&s;h marked his extreme con|fu&s;ion&mdash;and he looked around him, as if from a vain wi&s;h to &s;hrink from an ob&s;erver he could not but dread. The loud laugh was converted into an unmeaning grin, and the &s;tudied repartee died away on his quivering lips.&mdash; He rivetted his eyes on the floor&mdash;when approaching him
<PB N="12" REF="021723_0015_0FB740B122945738">
with my u&s;ual ea&s;e and freedom.&mdash;"I little expected, captain," &s;aid I, with all the <HI>&s;ang-froid</HI> I could a&s;&s;ume, "the honor of finding you here."</P>
<P>He &s;tood agha&s;t, and replacing the &s;parkling gla&s;s that he was about to convey to his lips, on the table, ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and declared, with &s;ome perturbation, that he really had not the honor of knowing me.</P>
<P>"Then, Sir," &s;aid I, approaching nearer, and look|ing firmly in his face, "either you have a very treach|erous memory, or I have very treacherous eyes."</P>
<P>"Faith, very likely, Sir!" he exclaimed, re&s;uming his native effrontery,&mdash;"my memory is &s;ometimes treacher|ous: for 'pon my &s;oul" (taking out an opera gla&s;s, and point|ing it impudently at my face) "I cannot recollect, Sir, I ever had the plea&s;ure of contemplating your features before; and yet," added he, with an air of <HI>non-chalance,</HI> "I po&s;&s;ibly may; for immaterial occurrences, and tran|&s;ient acquaintance, make but a very &s;light impre&s;&s;ion on my mind." As he uttered the&s;e words he threw him&s;elf carele&s;sly into a chair and yawned.</P>
<P>My patience was nearly exhau&s;ted by this in&s;olence; but determined not to hazard my victory by lo&s;ing my temper, I re&s;olved to be-calm, and a&s;&s;uming a compo|&s;ure, very foreign to my heart, I lamented the defect in his memory, and enquired if he had likewi&s;e forgot|ten that his name was Temple, and that I lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e with his lady and him&s;elf at Plymouth.</P>
<P>"Totally, my good Sir!" he replied, again, laughing immoderately.&mdash;"Pray you, my well remembered&mdash; friends," addre&s;&s;ing his companions, with a triumph|ant &s;neer at me&mdash;"can any of you recollect that my name is Temple, or that I ever had a lady at Ply|mouth?" They all vociferated a negative&punc; and the im|po&s;tor had the a&s;&s;urance to add, that, in his opinion, I had better try the efficacy of a gla&s;s of their burgundy to &s;ettle the derangement in my brain; and filling a bumper, he toa&s;ted the widow Barrymore, and daring|ly called on me to honour it.</P>
<P>Rou&s;ed by this in&s;olent defiance, I pau&s;ed for a mo|ment, then looking di&s;dainfully at him, "Think not," &s;aid I, "that all your &s;ubter&s;uges will &s;hield you from

ju&s;tice. Whatever names you may have a&s;&s;umed to &s;pread deva&s;tations around you, you know me well; and when I tell you, that &s;ince. your &s;candalous flight I have again been an inhabitant of the hou&s;e where fir&s;t I &s;aw you and your amiable injured wife, you mu&s;t like|wi&s;e be convinced that I know you, to your confu&s;ion and eternal &s;hame."</P>
<P>As I concluded the&s;e words, the ruffian &s;eized a bottle that &s;tood before him, and fiercely menaced it at me; but one of his companions re&s;training his arm, firmly de|clared he would not &s;uffer any violence to be u&s;ed, as it appeared to him it was altogether a mi&s;take. "For my friend's name," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing me, "is not Temple, but Dormer."</P>
<P>"It is not unlikely, Sir" I replied. "I may know the gentleman by a fictitious name; but be a&s;&s;ured I am ful|ly convinced of the identity of his per&s;on:&mdash;and let me add, his very rage on the occa&s;ion proves that he deems it highly inconvenient, and particularly mal|apropos, to know me at this juncture."</P>
<P>"Villain, &s;lave, madman!" echoed the enraged mon&s;ter, &s;truggling to elude the hold of his friend.&mdash; "My &s;word &s;hall prove thy &s;candalous a&s;&s;ertions fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid I, "keep your &s;word for &s;ome future oc|ca&s;ion. I come here in behalf of &s;uffering innocence; not to put my life in competition with that of an unprin|cipled de&s;perado;&mdash;and, but from an impul&s;e of huma|nity, &s;hould never have obtruded my unwelcome pre&s;ence on your fe&s;tivity; or have di&s;turbed your conque&s;ts. For your threats, I &s;corn them equally with your&s;elf; and have only to &s;ay, let tho&s;e that tru&s;t you&mdash;Beware."</P>
<P>With the&s;e words I ha&s;tily quitted the hou&s;e in ex|treme agitation, and returned to the place where I left my &s;ervant, quite undetermined re&s;pecting my future conduct in this affair. But judge of my amazement, as I was &s;itting in the window of my apartment, ruminating on the pa&s;t &s;cene, and deeply ab&s;orbed in contemplating the grief that mu&s;t inevi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ably await Ela, to behold her pa&s;s the hou&s;e in a po&s;t-chai&s;e. The carriage pa&s;&s;ed with extreme rapidity&mdash;the view I had of my fair friend was barely

momentary, but I well knew it to be her; and throwing up the &s;a&s;h, I beheld her alight only a few doors from where I was. Gue&s;&s;ing that her motive for vi&s;iting South|ampton was &s;imilar to mine, I ha&s;tened to receive the con|firmation from her own lips, and gave her every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e and joy animated her dejected form&mdash;as I ap|proached, her, "My be&s;t, my only friend!" &s;he exclaimed in an impa&s;&s;ioned tone, "hath the Supreme Being again graciou&s;ly directed you to her, who&s;e afflictions are I hope nearly complete?" Her eyes &s;wam in tears, I felt my&s;elf unable to make her any reply. An interval of &s;ilence en&s;ued, when drawing from her pocket a letter, &s;he put it into my hand, &s;aying, "That is what has brought me here." Its contents were as follow:</P>

<HEAD>MORTIMER TO CAROLINE. [In continuation.]</HEAD>
<P>MY heart applauded the conduct of this hone&s;t fel|low who&s;e re&s;pectful attention to Ela I had often re|marked:
<PB N="15" REF="021723_0018_0FB740BDF9D05AA0">
and it &s;erved to confirm this opinion, that true greatne&s;s of &s;oul is not con&s;ined to any &s;ituation; but as of|ten re&s;ides in the bo&s;om of the mendicant as that of the monarch. I then returned the letter to Ela, and &s;he re|que&s;ted my advice in what manner to proceed. I pau&s;ed &s;ome moments; then after a little preparatory conver&s;ation, I related my interview with the perfidious man, on whom her &s;oul &s;till doated. She reclined her head on her hand, and &s;at the &s;ilent picture of unutterable wo. Not one tear fell, but a fearful wildne&s;s glared in her eyes, which were &s;teadfa&s;tly rivetted to one point. I trembled for the con&s;equences of this de&s;perate &s;orrow, and &s;pared no pains to melt her into &s;oftne&s;s: my endeavours were happily crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, and a friendly &s;hower of tears&punc; in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviated the exqui&s;ite angui&s;h of her mind. But her &s;ilence &s;till continued, and when I pre&s;&s;ed to know in what manner &s;he de&s;igned to act, &s;he only waved her hand and left me. I con&s;idered her &s;orrow as &s;a|cred, and well a&s;&s;ured that any intru&s;ion would, at &s;uch a juncture, be unwelcome, was quitting the hou&s;e, when a &s;ervant followed me to the door, put into my hand the&s;e lines, rendered, by the tears and agitation of the writer, &s;carcely intelligible.</P>
<P>"The unhappy Ela is incapable either of thinking or acting, until that merciful Being&punc; who views her deep affliction, &s;hall graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afe to comfort her; then will &s;he again &s;ee, thank, and &s;upplicate the aid of her generous friend; but at this di&s;tre&s;sful moment her poig|nant di&s;tre&s;s admits of no alleviation, and the eye, even of &s;ympathetic ob&s;ervation, would only add to her &s;uffer|ings."</P>
<P>Fully convinced of the truth of her a&s;&s;ertion, I ha&s;|tened to my lodgings and penned a long letter, which might, I hoped contribute to infu&s;e re&s;ignation and forti|tude into her mind; nor did it fail of producing, in &s;ome degree, the de&s;ired effect. Some tedious hours elap&s;ed in anxious expectation, when I received a card from the gentle mourner reque&s;ting to &s;ee me; and in&s;tantly fol|lowing the me&s;&s;enger, found her calm and collected be|yond my mo&s;t &s;anguine hope. A tear indeed &s;hone in her eye, but it &s;eemed rather the tear of meek &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, than
<PB N="16" REF="021723_0019_0FB740C984ED42D0">
excruciating remor&s;e or &s;evere regret; and with all that prevailing eloquence, with which nature has mo&s;t libe|rally endowed her, &s;he, ardently be&s;ought me to con|duct her to the mo&s;t ungrat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ful, yet &s;till tenderly beloved of mankind, that &s;he might at lea&s;t hear her &s;entence from his own lips, ere &s;he re&s;igned her &s;oul to de&s;pair In vain I endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade her from &s;o ra&s;h an under|taking, and intreated her to have recour&s;e to her pen; but all my rhetoric was &s;oft. "What!" &s;he replied, "warn him again to avoid my dreadful pre&s;ence! No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> let me once again behold him, I a&s;k no more."</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that all argument was in&s;ufficient to change her &s;ettled purpo&s;e, we had recour&s;e to the addre&s;s in the po&s;t&s;cript of the worthy Barlow's letter, and I ac|companied her on this arduous expedition.</P>
<P>Barlow received us it the door of their habitation, and &s;eeing his late loved mi&s;tre&s;s all pale and trembling, only prevented by my &s;u&s;taining arm from &s;inking to the earth; his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lorid complexion was in&s;tantly &s;upplanted by a death|lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hue, and he continued holding the door in his hand, and gazing at us in an attitude of &s;orrow and amaze|ment.</P>
<P>"William," &s;aid the &s;weet &s;ufferer, extending her arm toward him. "good, faithful William!"&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e affecting words, and the &s;till more affecting man|ner in which they were uttered, gave a turn to the emotions of this truly excellent man, and &s;pringing forward, he faltered out, "Dear, injured, be&s;t of ladies;"&mdash;but, un|able to add more, turned a&s;ide to conceal his agitation, and wiped off a pitying tear with the &s;leeve of his coat.</P>
<P>Ela held his hand in her own, and looked up to Heaven &mdash;Such a &s;cene mu&s;t &s;urely have penetrated the mo&s;t un|feeling heart, and could not fail to immortalize the pencil of the mo&s;t renowned arti&s;t, if he copied from nature and truth.

fa&s;hion and ta&s;te, can be&s;tow, &s;eated in a &s;plendid chariot, the golden &s;tripes of which mingled with all the vivid co|lours of the rainbow, and glittered in the &s;un-beams. Ela's eyes followed mine, and Barlow exclaimed, "It is my ma&s;ter!" The wretch regarded us with a furi|ous look, and pulling the &s;tring, ordered the driver to go on. But Ela, eluding our hold, cla&s;ped the chariot wheel in her arms, &s;aying, "O merciful Heaven! I will be heard, or in this po&s;ture peri&s;h!"</P>
<P>"Drive on, drive on!" exclaimed the mon&s;ter; but the &s;ervant, in who&s;e brea&s;t a principle of humanity dwelt, &s;eeing the &s;ituation of Ela, refu&s;ed to comply&mdash;"The lady, Sir!" &s;aid he. "The devil," replied his brutal commander, leaping from the chariot. Ela caught hold of his arm as he de&s;cended.&mdash;"My Henry," &s;he cried, falling on the ground, "will you not know your wife, your own Ela?&mdash;"Know thee, woman!" exclaimed he, throwing her from him, "away! thou art &s;ome wretched maniac, whom that villain!" glancing his eyes at me, "has hired to in&s;ult me!" She uttered a piercing &s;hriek, and the wretch darted from us. I &s;lew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She looked p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">teou&s;ly in my face&mdash;I &s;aw that affliction had nearly fini&s;hed its work. Barlow conducted us into the hou&s;e, and &s;he fainted in my arms. One &s;it was quick|ly &s;ucceeded by another, and in the intervals of rea&s;on, the principles of life faded in her eyes, and the univer|&s;al conqueror &s;eemed making his awful approach. In this &s;tate &s;he continued &s;ome hours without the &s;malle&s;t ap|pearance of a favourable change, and I reque&s;ted Barlow to procure a coach to convey her back to her la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e abode; but a loud rapping at the &s;treet door prevented his immediate acquie&s;cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and announced the return of his ma&s;ter.</P>

Barlow, made no reply, but turning from him with an indignant and pity-marked countenance, ha&s;tened to the room that contained us. Dormer followed, uttering mo&s;t tremendous threat|enings; but on beholding me, with the lifele&s;s form of Ela in my arms, he &s;tood &s;ome moments apparently rooted to the &s;pot&mdash;and the uplifted came dropped from his hand.
<PB N="18" REF="021723_0021_0FB740CC319C7468">
&mdash;A tran&s;ient emanation of remor&s;e cro&s;&s;ed his features; but his native depravity quickly triumphed over every milder &s;en&s;ation; and, approaching me with de&s;peration and inconceivable fury,&mdash;"Now!" he wildly exclaimed, "ba&s;e in&s;olent lyar, give me in&s;tant &s;atisfaction."</P>
<P>Satisfaction!&mdash;&s;aid I, pointing to the corp&s;e-like Ela&mdash; "Look here."

The &s;ight of his generous blood, &s;pilt in my defence, called forth every fiery particle with which nature has in&s;pired me, and &s;eeing the villain about to repeat his attack, I in&s;tantly quitted the happily-in&s;en|&s;ible Ela; and enraged beyond all bounds of moderation, met him with fury equal to his own. But yet my pre&s;ence of mind proved &s;uperior. His wild de&s;peration put him entirely in my power; and, eluding his pa&s;s, I ea&s;ily wrenched the &s;word from his &s;lackened arm, &s;aying.&mdash; "Thy life is mine; but take it and make expiation for thy guilt."&mdash;The humbled tyrant hid his face and was &s;ilent. &mdash;I offered up an ejaculation to that power who had thus graciou&s;ly pre&s;erved me from murder; and hoping that the provocation would procure me a pardon for engaging in a practice I ju&s;tly abhorred, carele&s;sly threw his &s;word on the carpet, and turned to my fair charge and her faithful guardian. Barlow; who&s;e garments were all en&s;anguined from the wound in his arm. But the ba&s;e Dormer, &s;eeing me thus unguarded, &s;natched up his &s;word and again dared me to the combat, adding, that his haughty un&s;ubmitting &s;pirit &s;corn|ed to accept the life that I could give; and death &s;hould end the conte&s;t. In vain I expo&s;tulated, and warned him to avoid my awakened vengeance. He was deaf to all I &s;aid;&mdash;and I mo&s;t reluctantly acquie&s;ced with his impetuous mad|ne&s;s.&mdash;But victory again awaited me; I di&s;armed him with equal facility as before; but his &s;word wounded

my wri&s;t in the &s;cuffle, and the blood gu&s;hed out like a fountain.&mdash;The pain of the wound, and the &s;ight of the &s;tream that flowed from it, added to the ungrateful return my former lenity had met, determined me to en&s;ure the pre&s;ent conque&s;t by force, and inflict a corporal puni&s;hment on the aggre&s;&s;or; and taking up the cane that had been lift|ed again&s;t the unoffending Barlow, I expended my &s;trength on the &s;ides of the degraded, but &s;till menacing coward; for &s;uch in reality he was, and forcing him into an adjacent room, I bolted the door, effectually to prevent his further intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>During this encounter, a ray of animation revi&s;ited the death-like Ela; but &s;he was &s;till totally in&s;en&s;ible to all that pa&s;&s;ed. Re&s;uming my &s;tation by her &s;ide, Barlow ha&s;tened to procure a coach at my reque&s;t; and calling at a &s;urgeon's in our way to Ela's lodgings, our wounds were examined and dre&s;&s;ed; when, with the con&s;oling a&s;&s;urance of their being unattended by danger, we proceeded with our greatly recovered charge. Then di&s;patching Barlow to relea&s;e his worthle&s;s ma&s;ter, I earne&s;tly recommended Ela to the care of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, who &s;eemed a much more hu|manized being than her with whom we had re&s;ided at Plymouth; and after prevailing on us to take &s;ome cordial refre&s;hment. Ela, who had never uttered a &s;yllable &s;ince our return, &s;uffered me to lead her to a &s;opha; and, in a few moments, an apparently balmy &s;lumber &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pend every embittering remembrance. But anxiety &s;till pervad|ed my heart, and I waited impatiently for the return of our hone&s;t confederate. A con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed without his appearance; and Ela awoke from the deep &s;tupor which I had mi&s;taken for &s;leep. She fixed her eyes mournfully on mine, but her &s;en&s;es were &s;till ab&s;orbed in forgetfulne&s;s; at lea&s;t the &s;ufferings &s;he had &s;o recently ex|perienced only floated on the &s;urface of her mind, like the &s;hadowy remembrance of an unplea&s;ing dream; and all my endeavours proved in&s;ufficient to break her &s;ilence. I &s;poke to her repeatedly on the &s;ubject that I well knew could not fall deeply to affect her heart, but without gain|ing any other reply than a heavy &s;igh, or a gloomy &s;mile. At length the long ab&s;ence of Barlow greatly alarmed me, and fully a&s;&s;ured that it mu&s;t originate from &s;ome di&s;a&s;|trous

circum&s;tance, I re&s;olved to go in que&s;t of him, and left Ela in charge with the woman of the hou&s;e; with who&s;e obliging attention I was quite &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>An ill-looking fellow opened Dormer's door; when, on my enquiring if Barlow was there, he replied in the af|firmative. Pretending to call him, he returned with three others, of &s;imilar exterior with him&s;elf, and &s;eizing me declared they would &s;oon conduct me to Barlow, who&s;e fellow a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in they knew me to be, and we &s;hould receive the reward of our crimes. I was accordingly hurried into the pre&s;ence of an old ignorant unprincipled wretch, dig|nified by the appellation of a ju&s;tice; where, after &s;ome &s;en&s;ele&s;s interrogations, all that I could &s;ay in my defence was treated with contempt, and turned into ridicule; and after the u&s;ual forms I was committed to the pri&s;on that held my fellow &s;ufferer, the truly e&s;timable Barlow. Here we mingled our painful emotions together, not for our own misfortunes, but tho&s;e of Ela; thus deprived of every earthly aid, and expo&s;ed to every evil from the malice and revenge of the wretch who had thus reduced her.</P>
<P>Happy was it for you, my dear and amiable Caroline, that no officious tongue dared to whi&s;per the unmerited ig|nominy and &s;ufferings which at that period awaited your brother. Condemned to the &s;ociety of the mo&s;t hardened ruffians, and loaded with heavy irons, like the mo&s;t attro|cious violator of my country's laws; yet, con&s;cious in|tegrity &s;upported my &s;pirit, and the dignity and chearful|ne&s;s of my mind was unimpaired. My anxiety, never|thele&s;s, was extreme for the uncertain fate of my lovely but unfortunate friend, for whom I was more than ever in|tere&s;ted by the imperfect &s;ketches of her numerous virtues, but too adventurous love, which our faithful Barlow com|municated to me during the early hours of our impri&s;on|ment. In the mid&s;t of his unconnected, yet mo&s;t affect|ing narrative, the form of her, who&s;e &s;orrows we were contemplating, &s;tood before us, led by the &s;ame group of wretches that had been our conductors. Lo&s;t to every &s;en|&s;ation but the plea&s;ure of again beholding her in exi&s;tence, I &s;prang toward her, but the clanking of my &s;etters &s;truck her with inexpre&s;&s;ible horror, and cla&s;ping her hands fear|fully together, &s;he attempted to fly from me. Her ungentle
<PB N="21" REF="021723_0024_0FB740E031B72858">
attendants, however, effectually prevented her; when one of them daring to u&s;e very in&s;olent language, and treating her very roughly, I &s;eized an earthen mug that &s;tood on one of the windows, and aimed it at his head; but he, luckily for me, avoided the blow; and I was from that moment deemed a mo&s;t de&s;perate villain by all my fellow pri&s;oners: and all my looks and actions created &s;u&s;picions of &s;ome dia|bolical intent.</P>
<P>But &s;hocked, as Ela was at our fate, &s;he &s;ubmitted with the mo&s;t perfect re&s;ignation to her own.&mdash;Not one murmur e&s;caped her lips&mdash;but a &s;ilent and corroding melancholy was rooted in her heart! She evidently avoided even our conver&s;e; and it was not without infinite labour that we pre|vailed on her to relate the particulars of what had befallen her after our &s;eparation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that awakened her from the lethargic &s;tate in which I had left her when I went in que&s;t of Barlow, was enquiry from the landlady, whether &s;he did not expect my return that evening? This que&s;tion &s;eemed to bring back the power of reflection, and filled her with alarming conjectures re&s;pecting our my&s;terious ab&s;ence. After &s;ome hours of anxious expectation &s;he di&s;patched in &s;earch of us a me&s;&s;enger, who returned with the party that appre|hended me, and were placed as centinels at her betrayer's door, to &s;eize any that &s;hould enquire for Barlow or my|&s;elf. They took her into cu&s;tody as an accomplice with as in a&s;&s;aulting and robbing this mon&s;ter of depravity.</P>
<P>"And now," added the uncomplaining victim of un|bounded love, looking pen&s;ively at us&mdash;"the mea&s;ure of my woes is nearly full; and but for the cruel return your goodne&s;s has experienced, pain could never more touch my heart. Be you re&s;tored to liberty and happine&s;s, and a pri&s;on or a palace is equal to the undone Ela." I omit|ted no argument that could po&s;&s;ibly afford her comfort, nor was the hone&s;t Barlow le&s;s a&s;&s;iduous. We treated our misfortune as a fooli&s;h adventure, and dubbing our&s;elves knights-errant of the fir&s;t order, told her that our pre&s;ent &s;ufferings would only prove a &s;ubject for our future boa&s;t. But all our efforts were in&s;ufficient, even for a moment to di&s;&s;ipate the &s;ettled gloom that enveloped her mind. A grateful, yet melancholy &s;mile would often cro&s;s her features
<PB N="22" REF="021723_0025_0FB740E127530C10">
as &s;he li&s;tened to our flattering predictions of &s;eeing happy days; but, like the tran&s;ient refulgence of a winter's &s;un, it was quickly &s;ucceeded by clouds and darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal tedious days, when we were called to our trial, and the audacious de&s;troyer of innocence had even the daring wickedne&s;s to appear again&s;t us. Ela faint|ed the in&s;tant &s;he beheld him, and continued in&s;en&s;ible du|ring the whole time of our examination; but without pro|ducing any vi&s;ible effect on her cruel de&s;troyer.</P>
<P>Of the pretended robbery, no proof appeared, and we were therefore acquitted; but the driver of the chariot being &s;uborned to &s;wear to the identity of our per&s;ons. and Ela's endeavours to detain Dormer again&s;t his inclination, being corroborated by his own oath, and the brui&s;es I had &s;o liberally be&s;towed on him, we were convicted of the a&s;|&s;ault, and &s;entenced to pay two hundred pounds damages, and to &s;uffer with Barlow, who was deemed our a&s;&s;i&s;tant and accomplice, three months impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>All remon&s;trance was u&s;ele&s;s here, and a patient endu|rance of our heavy wrongs &s;eemed the only alternative.</P>
<P>This melancholy conclu&s;ion to our &s;ad adventures, ha&s;|tened an event which I before &s;aw was inevitable. The deadly &s;troke was given to the gentle heart of Ela; and it was not in the power of mortal aid to &s;u&s;pend the fatal con&s;equence. I re&s;olved to &s;ooth, if po&s;&s;ible, her fleet|ing days, and my attention to her &s;ufferings entirely ab|&s;orbed my own. Sometimes, indeed, I felt an ardent wi&s;h that my &s;ituation might e&s;cape the tongue of rumour, and never wound the heart of my amiable Caroline. This was the con&s;tant prayer of my &s;oul when reflection darted on my mind, and the event has proved that it was accepted.</P>
<P>Unknown to Ela. I penned a faithful narrative of her ca&s;e, to that lady whom the perfidious Dorm r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">marked for his future prey; but, charmed by his fal&s;e deluding arts, &s;he returned my letter unopened, with a me&s;&s;age that plainly evinced her heart ob&s;tinately &s;hut again&s;t conviction.</P>
<P>My whole attention, and that of the excellent Barlow, was now devoted in endeavouring to alleviate the &s;ilent but exqui&s;ite &s;ufferings of our fair fellow pri&s;oner. Vain hope, that can ever expect to &s;urmount a grief like hers.
<PB N="23" REF="021723_0026_0FB740E4EC1FBEF0">
I beheld her decline daily like &s;ome &s;weet and mode&s;t flower, bending beneath the pre&s;&s;ure of an inclement &s;ea&s;on. &mdash;In vain I intruded my&s;elf, from the be&s;t of motives, perpetually on her &s;olitude; no efforts could bani&s;h the deep rooted &s;adne&s;s that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her mind. During our impri&s;onment &s;he penned the inclo&s;ed letters&mdash;and, when we were again re&s;tored to freedom, I &s;till panted for ven|geance on the ba&s;e Dormer; but the gentle injured angel be&s;ought me &s;o eloquently to de&s;i&s;t, that it mu&s;t have been a heart as callous as his that could refu&s;e its acquie&s;cence. She begged me to conduct her back to Plymouth, where &s;he left the greate&s;t part of her cloaths, and papers that &s;he highly valued.</P>
<P>And here, my beloved Caroline, the motions of my heart, on recollecting the &s;cene that awaited as, forcibly &s;u&s;pends the progre&s;s of my tale. I mu&s;t therefore defer the &s;equel to &s;ome more tranquil moments, fully a&s;&s;ured that while you peru&s;e the following te&s;timonies of un&s;u&s;pecting ten|derne&s;s and dete&s;ted treachery, like me you will execrate the wretch capable of de&s;troying &s;o much native excellence, and drop a &s;ympathetic tear to the &s;orrows of the un|fortunate Ela.</P>
<P>Adieu, my much-loved &s;i&s;ter, expect &s;oon to receive the conclu&s;ion of my narrative, and let the remembrance of every pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;s give place to this con&s;oling a&s;&s;urance, that the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty again await,</P>

<P>THE fabrick of mi&s;guided enthu&s;ia&s;m at length &s;inks into oblivion.</P>

mo&s;t unequivocal conviction; and the only refuge my mi|&s;eries can hope, is through the awful regions of death. Thither all my wi&s;hes a&s;pire. Shame and affliction for ever await me here; but there is one who judges not by the ri|gid dictates of erring mortals. To him I dare &s;ubmit my cau&s;e, and his ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;urances of peace and pardon bids each tumultuous pa&s;&s;ion re&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>Thus, a&s;&s;ured, the bu&s;y clamours of unmerited ten|tenderne&s;s no longer di&s;turb my repo&s;e: but truth erects her &s;tandard in my &s;oul, and long e&s;tranged rea&s;on re|a&s;&s;umes her &s;way.&mdash;By their aid I clearly di&s;cern the folly of my pa&s;t life, and while the tears of penitence bur&s;t from my heart, piety and charity bid me forgive, and hope offers the be&s;t con&s;olations and never failing rewards.</P>
<P>No, longer then, my ine&s;timable friend, my more than brother, continue to grieve for tho&s;e &s;orrows that cea&s;e to exi&s;t.&mdash;They are gone to prepare the a&s;ylum to which I am ha&s;tening:&mdash;and all that remains for me is to en&s;ure a happy reception and pour the effu&s;ions of a grateful heart into your benevolent bo&s;om.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t moments of thankfulne&s;s for the generous part you took in my &s;orrows, I &s;aid you &s;hould know who &s;he was for whom you were thus intere&s;ted; but while fal&s;e hope, and the mo&s;t torturing anxiety kept my mind in a con&s;tant &s;tate of dreary &s;u&s;pence, I was unequal to the per|formance of that promi&s;e;&mdash;now each corroding pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems at re&s;t, and tranquillity wooes me to what was before in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>Born in the lap of luxury, the only darling of parental fondne&s;s, care was a &s;tranger to my heart 'till it approached me in the alluring garb of love.</P>

It is this native fervour of &s;oul that led to all my &s;orrows; incapable of guile my&s;elf, I never &s;u&s;pected it in others;&mdash; nor once thought it po&s;&s;ible for cruelty to lie concealed under the mo&s;t &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ions of love, honor, and fidelity; but the dreadful a&s;&s;urance

now &s;tands unveiled before me, and I fall in the early bloom of life, the martyr of my own deluded heart.</P>
<P>My father, at the remembrance of who&s;e indulgent good|ne&s;s &s;u&s;pended angui&s;h ru&s;hes like a torrent on my mind, was a man of eminence in that quarter of the globe. My mother I never knew; the moment that gave me being, con&s;igned her to the grave; and I believe contributed to endear me to the heart of my remaining parent, by whom &s;he was &s;o tenderly beloved, that the mention of her name, after a very con&s;iderable lap&s;e of time, never failed to call forth emotions too powerful to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The uncon|querable regret her lo&s;s occa&s;ioned, undermined by &s;low degrees his health, and certainly ha&s;tened his death.</P>
<P>Oh, be&s;t of men! How does that awful &s;cene croud, with every affecting circum&s;tance, on my awakened feel|lings? How does it recal &s;en&s;ations I could wi&s;h to cancel from the book of memory! His dying words never broke through my perjured &s;oul.&mdash;I behold the mo&s;t wronged and amiable of mankind, the all accompli&s;hed and excellent Granville Clifford, whi&s;pering &s;weete&s;t con&s;olation to my &s;orrow, while in vain he endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s his own.</P>
<P>The parents of Granville Clifford were Engli&s;h adven|turers, who&s;e numerous virtues and amiable manners en&s;ured them the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem of my father.&mdash;But they both met an early grave &s;oon after their arrival in India; and with their late&s;t breath committed their helple&s;s orphans, and their humble fortune, to the protection of their only friend; who &s;oothed their anxious hearts with the mo&s;t &s;olemn and generous a&s;&s;urances, of which his actions have proved the &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Granville Clifford was at that period, a beautiful boy of five years old; my&s;elf only &s;ix months. My father &s;oon felt a particular attachment to him, and he &s;hared with me his tendere&s;t affection. Thus we grew up together, and a &s;en|timent of filial love took deep root in my infant mind, and &s;trengthened with increa&s;ing years. The extreme loveline&s;s of his per&s;on, the remarkable endowments of his mind, and the winning graces of his manners, daily increa&s;ed the affection to which his defencele&s;s infancy gave birth in my father's generous bo&s;om, and he approved him&s;elf worthy of the charge with which he was entru&s;ted.&mdash;He
<PB N="26" REF="021723_0029_0FB740FD423BABA8">
always gave him the endearing appellation of &s;on, and deter|mined to hallow both on him and me every advantage that could be de&s;ired from the mo&s;t fini&s;hed education. But his affairs rendering it impo&s;&s;ible for him to quit India, his extreme tenderne&s;s, and the delight he experienced in our innocent endearments would not &s;uffer him to part with us; he therefore procured the be&s;t ma&s;ters for us from England, France, and Italy, and in&s;pecting our &s;tudies him|&s;elf, &s;pared neither expence nor trouble to accompli&s;h us in every u&s;eful and polite &s;cience: and render us a ble&s;&s;ing to him&s;elf and &s;ociety. How far his endeavours have been crowned with &s;ucce&s;s in me, is now, alas! too evident to need any further demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>The culture of our expanding minds was the &s;ole em|ployment of my father's lei&s;ure hours He &s;trove to impre&s;s us with the principles of morality; and his own example powerfully enforced the truths he taught.</P>
<P>The amiable Clifford imbibed in&s;truction as fa&s;t as it could be offered him. He made a rapid progre&s;s in every valuable attainment: and the improving beauties of his mind and per&s;on made him univer&s;ally care&s;&s;ed.&mdash;I was the da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ling object of his fond regard: to me his early preference was directed, and he a&s;pired to render me as perfect as him|&s;elf.&mdash;To in&s;pire me with the &s;ame love of beauty, harmony, and order, was his con&s;tant aim; and to him I am indebted for every virtue or accompli&s;hment that I po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>

Fatal period! from whence I may date the commencement of all my &s;orrows.</P>
<P>The anniver&s;ary of my birth was always devoted to mirth and fe&s;tivity. My friends and companions crouded to offer their congratulations: the day was &s;pent in every refined and innocent delight, and u&s;ually concluded with a ball and &s;upper in the highe&s;t &s;tyle of elegant &s;implicity. The heart of my indulgent father &s;eemed always dilated with unu&s;ual gladne&s;s on that occa&s;ion; and the expre&s;&s;ive features of Granville Clifford beamed unutterable things.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="021723_0031_0FB74102EED82060">It was in the mid&s;t of &s;uch a &s;cene as this, while in a pa|vilion fitted up for the night, every heart beat re&s;pon&s;ive to the power of harmony, and every age &s;parkled with plea&s;ure, that the arrival of Henry Dormer was announced.

<P><PB N="32" REF="021723_0035_0FB74118A0E45960">The adventure related in my la&s;t, trivial as was the impre&s;&s;ion it made on my mind, cau&s;ed a con&s;iderable alteration in our &s;ociety. A very perceptible gloom hovered around the &s;o lately gay and gallant Dormer. My father &s;eemed labouring with &s;ome concealed emo|tion&mdash;and more than common happine&s;s was vi&s;ible in Granville Clifford. I was perplexed by each of them,&mdash; but the behaviour of Dormer appeared the mo&s;t in|explicable, and dwelt &s;trongly on my mind. He &s;eemed to avoid my conver&s;e, and no longer &s;ought to charm me with the mu&s;ic of his tongue. Then it was that angui&s;h fir&s;t &s;eized my heart. Two days pa&s;&s;ed in a &s;tate of in|conceivable wretchedne&s;s. In vain I endeavoured to ac|count for the &s;ilent dejection of Dormer; the extreme vivacity of Clifford; or the my&s;terious air of my father: anxiety preyed deeply on my heart, and &s;leep was a &s;tranger to my couch.&mdash;In this &s;tate I was, when the &s;econd night after the e&s;cape from the jaws of the tyger, the &s;plendour of the heavenly luminaries, the &s;weet &s;erenity of the air, and the melancholy murmur of a di&s;tant wood-dove, added to the melody of a nightingale, clo&s;e to my chamber window, tempted me to indulge my contemplations in a &s;mall piazza, with which it was united. The moon &s;hone with unclouded radiance on a fine &s;heet of water that fronted the hou&s;e; I walked &s;ome time, buried in reflexion, when the &s;ound of a gentle noi&s;e behind me made me turn round, and I beheld a beau|tiful little &s;paniel that belonged to Dormer running to|wards me I eagerly caught the pretty animal in my arms, and loaded it with care&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.

The impropriety of my dre&s;s occurred, and I was retiring; but &s;pringing &s;uddenly forward he effectually prevented me. "Lovely Ela," he exclaimed, &s;eizing my hands&mdash;"will you indeed leave me to de&s;pair?" I was incapable of making any re+ply.

In this agitated &s;tate the hours were &s;pent, until a &s;ervant &s;ummoned me to breakfa&s;t; but the traces of &s;orrow, vi&s;ible in my face, rendered me an object really unfit to be &s;een, and I pleaded indi&s;po&s;ition as an excu&s;e for keep|ing my chamber.

I &s;eemed degraded in my own opinion&mdash;I wi&s;hed to recall the me&s;&s;age, but it was too late. "Gracious Heaven," &s;aid I, "what have I done that &s;hould need the ma&s;k of fal&s;ehood, that &s;hould prompt me in any &s;hape to deceive the be&s;t of fathers?

I would not, methinks, for worlds offend or di&s;tre&s;s this good parent; and at this juncture I fear I could neither &s;uppre&s;s my emotions nor bear his pre&s;ence. But his tenderne&s;s, claims every return in my power, and I will &s;acrifice each wi&s;h of my own to promote his

I could with fortitude bear any &s;uffering of my own in &s;ilence;&mdash;but how &s;hall I &s;upport tho&s;e of my Henry?&mdash;The bare idea of his being wretched is torture. Oh! fatal, fatal attachment! it has, I fear, forever ba|ni&s;hed peace from my bo&s;om; and, perhaps, involved the mo&s;t charming of men in mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>In reflections like the&s;e I was buried until the hour of dinner approached, and I began to dre&s;s for that occa&s;ion; but before I had ri&s;en from the toilet, my father &s;ent to enquire if I was well enough to attend him in the mu&s;ic-room; I replied in the affirmative, and in a few minutes followed the me&s;&s;enger.&mdash;Granville Clifford was with him; I trembled and felt a &s;anguine glow mount into my cheeks as I approached them; but the &s;weet compla|cency of my dear father's features, rea&s;&s;ured me.&mdash;His eyes delicately avoided to &s;crutinize my altered looks; but giving me an open letter&mdash;"Here is a &s;weet compa|nion for you, my dear Ela," &s;aid he, ju&s;t arrived from England."&mdash;I glanced my eyes over the letter: it was from a much e&s;teemed friend of my father's, warmly recommending a young orphan lady (who de&s;titute of any portion but an uncommon &s;hare of per&s;onal and mental graces, had evinced a de&s;ire to vi&s;it India) to his protection.</P>
<P>"This amiable lady," &s;aid my father, as I returned him the letter, "if &s;he an&s;wers the de&s;cription here given, will, I hope, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, compen&s;ate to our little &s;ociety, for the lo&s;s of our agreeable Dormer, who quitted us early this morning." I felt the colour de&s;ert my cheeks as he pronounced the&s;e words My heart &s;eemed to die within me, and I was very near &s;inking to the ground; but &s;ummoning all my &s;trength. I &s;eated my&s;elf in a chair by his &s;ide, and a&s;&s;uming an air of in|difference, very foreign to my heart, expre&s;&s;ed my &s;ur|prize at the &s;uddenne&s;s of Dormer's departure; then, to prevent any more being &s;aid on the &s;ubject, I took up

Never was a poor wretch, who&s;e hard fate had long e&s;tranged him from the chearing beams of the &s;un and the joys of liberty, more rejoiced at being again re&s;tored to light and freedom, than I was at being left to the unmo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ted indulgence of my feelings.&mdash;Again I retired to my chamber, and dropped the tear of bitter regret for the lo&s;s I feared I had &s;u&s;tained, in being for ever &s;eparated from the &s;avoured obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct of my tender choice.

<P>I pre&s;&s;ed the in&s;en&s;ible paper to my bo&s;om.

<P>But if I was &s;truck with admiration, by the beauties of the fair &s;tranger's per&s;on, how greatly was that ad|miration increa&s;ed by the graces of her mind and man|ners.

Every new day &s;hewed &s;ome, before undi&s;covered, charm in her: My e&s;teem for her increa&s;ed in proportion to her merits; and I &s;oon conceived a very tender affection for her, which &s;eemed to meet an abundant return.&mdash;We were never a&s;under: we formed a variety of amu&s;ive &s;chemes; and Granville Clifford &s;pared no pains to render them delightful. My native vivacity was unbounded, and I endeavoured to exert it all in compliment to our lovely gue&s;t. By appearing gay I was believed to be happy; while the image of Henry Dormer &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my whole &s;oul, and melancholy never failed to draw her &s;ecret <HI>&s;ombre</HI> &s;hade acro&s;s the brighte&s;t &s;cenes.&mdash;My father &s;miled &s;erenely on our inno|cent plea&s;ures: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e fancied that all that di&s;turbed my repo&s;e was forgotten; he was infinitely delighted with the beautiful St. Clare, and &s;howed her every po&s;&s;ible mark of friend&s;hip and di&s;tinction.&mdash;Fe&s;tivity reigned around us. Splendid entertainments, balls, ma&s;ques, &amp;c. were given in honour of our charming favourite,

which effectually introduced her to our Indo&s;tan neigh|bours, and &s;he was &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed as the fair Sultana of the day.

Why &s;ubject her&s;elf to (&s;uffer me to &s;ay) the cen&s;ure of indelicacy by commencing an adventurer, if unable to &s;upport that character, and ta&s;te its proffered fruits?&mdash;This was an enigma which I was unable clearly to &s;olve;&mdash;yet, a perhaps, &s;ometimes cro&s;&s;ed my mind, that the amiable Clifford was the barrier to her golden pro&s;pects.

<P>IN vain &s;hould I attempt to de&s;cribe the poignancy of my &s;orrow, on the ever regreted occa&s;ion, with the account of which my la&s;t letter concluded; but a heart like yours full of &s;en&s;ibility, and awake to all the tender claims of nature, will ea&s;ily conceive them; why then &s;hould I labour to recal a &s;cene, the remembrance of which fills my &s;oul with inexpre&s;&s;ible torture, and greatly augments my pre&s;ent &s;ufferings!</P>

<P>My father had made no di&s;po&s;ition of his effects, every thing therefore devolved to me. This was a conduct I did not expect, nor was I at all gratified by it, as I wi&s;hed and always believed, he would certainly en&s;ure Granville Clifford an independency; but at the &s;ame time it determin|ed me to make him every compen&s;ation in my power for this apparent neglect. It was certainly this belief from whence this extraordinary &s;tep of my father's originated. &mdash;He judged of my heart by his own: but, alas! the conclu&s;ion was mo&s;t fatally deceptive.&mdash;He did not reflect that the human heart is not to be relied on; and a heart in|clined like mine &s;till le&s;s &s;o than any other.

his elegant features, and a pen&s;ive habit took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul.&mdash;His fond attachment now looked up to me as a prize to which he dur&s;t not a&s;pire&mdash;and he determined no more to per&s;ecute me with, as he termed it, his unworthy love, but to mourn the deprivation of all his hopes in &s;ecret, and gladly &s;acrifice his own happine&s;s to my intere&s;t. Often had he marked the reluctance with which I attended to the language of his heart; but, un&s;u&s;picious of my pre|ference for Dormer, he hoped every thing from time, and the encouragement and intere&s;t of my father: but now he had lo&s;t that, he re&s;olved to withdraw his claims, and (to u&s;e his own words) leave me to &s;ome brighter fate.

Penetrated to the &s;oul by the tender and re&s;pectful ardour of his attachment, and the fulle&s;t conviction of his exalted merits, I &s;incerely partook of his felicity; and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted right, tri|umphed over every &s;en&s;ation that had warred again&s;t my peace; when the door of the room &s;uddenly opened, and, quite un&s;u&s;picious of intru&s;ion, Augu&s;ta St. Clare entered, followed by Henry Dormer.&mdash;They both &s;tarted back&mdash; Clifford changed colour, and I fainted in his arms. On my recovery, the fir&s;t object that pre&s;ented it&s;elf was Dormer kneeling by my &s;ide: tenderne&s;s and keen reproach marked his features, he ventured to embrace me with ardour; he pre&s;&s;ed his lips to my cheek; I reclined involuntarily on his bo&s;om; and bur&s;t into tears.

anxious on my account, for I was quite recovered. He &s;eemed totally in&s;en&s;ible of my conde&s;cen&s;ion, he &s;till hung over the back of the chair, and gazed at me in gloomy &s;ilence; then &s;uddenly withdrawing his penetrating eyes, he &s;truck his hands on his forehead, and darted out of the room. I was deeply affected by his manner: memory brought back the ju&s;t departed &s;cene; and the &s;olemn vows I had &s;o lately uttered filled me with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible re|gret. The dying words of my revered father aro&s;e upon my mind, and con&s;pired to rack me. The beauteous Au|gu&s;ta regarded me with gentle&s;t &s;ympathy, and Dormer &s;at between us ab&s;orbed in thought. The appearance of dinner proved a welcome relief: a &s;ervant was di&s;patched to inform Clifford we waited for him; but he returned for an&s;wer, that a &s;udden but violent illne&s;s rendered him incapable of attending. I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly alarmed at this account&mdash;embarra&s;&s;ment hovered around Dormer, and a tender &s;adne&s;s was vi&s;ible in Augu&s;ta: our meal was cheerle&s;s, the un&s;ocial gloom was only di&s;turbed by a few tender enquiries relative to my health from the amiable Augu&s;ta, and &s;ome broken unintelligible &s;entences from the agitated Dormer.&mdash;An in&s;ufferable load of conflicting pa&s;&s;ions overwhelmed my heart: and as &s;oon as dinner was removed I pleaded an excu&s;e for retiring, and ha&s;tened to the chamber of Clifford.

<P>THE illne&s;s of Clifford increa&s;ed with &s;uch rapidity, that in a very few hours the faculty pronounced him in im|minent danger.&mdash;My grief was &s;incere, his innumerable vir|tues dwelt forcibly on my mind, and for &s;everal days and nights no per&s;ua&s;ions could prevail on me to quit his &s;ide. The name of Ela dwelt for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver on his lips, &s;ometimes ac|companied with that of my father; but much oftner by that of Henry Dormer. I admini&s;tered his medicines with my own hands, and, kneeling, fervently be&s;ought that Heaven would endow them with the power of re&s;toration. The lovely Augu&s;ta lent her friendly aid, and &s;hared my anxiety, Dormer &s;ometimes ventured to intrude, and never failed to remind me of the injury my health mu&s;t inevitably &s;u&s;tain from the deprivation of re&s;t; but no in|treaties could prevail on me to quit this &s;cene, until mental and bodily fatigue, added to my having neglected the ne|ce&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment of food and &s;leep totally over powered me, and the third night of my watching I was conveyed in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility to my chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="021723_0050_0FB73E19648405C0">This fatal weakne&s;s was the inlet to all my &s;ucceeding misfortunes; Dormer had now every opportunity to di&s;play his feigned attachment, nor did he neglect to avail him&s;elf of it.

"Say," my deare&s;t love," &s;aid he, as &s;oon as we were &s;eated, "where the&s;e faithful creatures may find &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary cloaths as will &s;uffice for the voyage."&mdash;I marked out &s;ome trunks well &s;tocked with linen, &s;everal riding dre&s;&s;es, and all my jewels; and, under the covert of the night, we arrived in a few hours on the &s;ea-&s;hore; the Indians following with our bag|gage. The very winds &s;eemed bribed to promote the wi&s;hes of the ba&s;e Henry, and ha&s;ten my de&s;truction; they filled the fluttering &s;ails, and conveyed us with rapidity from the Indo&s;tan &s;hores. But the morning light &s;eemed to bring back &s;u&s;pended reflection. A variety of bitter accu&s;ers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rouded round my heart. My eyes eagerly &s;ought the dear haunts of my nativity&mdash;the&s;e &s;cenes of innocence and artle&s;s joys forcibly recurred to my di&s;tracted mind&mdash;the image of Granville Clifford aro&s;e with them: I beheld him langui&s;hing on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s;&mdash;methought I heard him once more reque&s;t to &s;ee his long-loved Ela, and ble&s;s her ere he died.&mdash;Unequal to the conflict, remor&s;e and poignant angui&s;h &s;eized me, and I wept pa&s;&s;ionately in the bo&s;om of the &s;oft &s;educer. But he &s;oon found means to &s;ooth my troubled &s;oul, and bani&s;h every image but his own. He prevailed on me to &s;ign a writing, empowering a per&s;on, in whom he dared confide, to turn all my effects into mo|ney, and tran&s;mit their value to England by the fir&s;t op|portunity. This end accompli&s;hed. Dormer devoted all his time to alleviate the anxiety that &s;ometimes preyed upon my peace. But the righteous vengeance of Heaven pur&s;ued my cruel perfidy. A dreadful &s;torm aro&s;e ju&s;t as we gain|ed fight of England; and, after perils almo&s;t incredible, we were wrecked on a dangerous coa&s;t in the we&s;tern part of the i&s;land.

<P>The fir&s;t thing that &s;truck my ob&s;ervation was, that Hen|ry had impo&s;ed me on tho&s;e excellent people for his wife; and, guided by the &s;ophi&s;try of his baleful arguments, I be|lieved my&s;elf in fact &s;uch. Here, fain would I draw a veil over my own conduct, but ju&s;tice forces me to &s;ubmit to the humiliating confe&s;&s;ion, and own, while deep repentance wrings my heart and tears &s;tream from my eyes, that, in obedience to his will, I meanly dared to join in the guilty deception.</P>
<P>Methinks I &s;ee your upright &s;oul turn with horror from the picture I have drawn of my&s;elf; but &s;oft-eyed pity is the child of goodne&s;s, and the fulle&s;t conviction a&s;&s;ures me that &s;he is the native inmate of your exalted mind.

<P>Our kind entertainers believing us &s;uch as we appeared, &s;oon evinced the mo&s;t flattering partiality for us, and im|pre&s;&s;ed with &s;incere compa&s;&s;ion for the misfortunes that led us to their ho&s;pitable roof, hearing Dormer mention our expected remittances from India, earne&s;tly be&s;ought us to remain with them until they arrived.

Several weeks elap&s;ed in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t tedious uncertainty, when Dormer received an account from his friend in India which &s;ufficiently awaked me from my dream of happine&s;s, by pre&s;enting to my mind the mo&s;t terrifying views.

A deep gloom over&s;pread Dormer's countenance, and he &s;tood gazing at me in mournful &s;ilence, while the letter fell from his trembling hand to the floor, "Hark," &s;aid I, "do you not hear the generous injured Clifford praying for me, faithle&s;s and cruel as I am, even in the agonies of death?&mdash;Do you not &s;ee the lovely Augu&s;ta imploring mercy for him, rather than her&s;elf?

<P>Thus we were again re&s;tored to apparent tranquillity, and Dormer propo&s;ed his immediate departure for Lon|don, there to wait the remittances from Holland; but ad|vi&s;ed my remaining with our ho&s;pitable friends until their arrival.

All language is much un|equal to delineate my feelings at that juncture: deaf to the intreaties of all around me, I procured a po&s;t-chai&s;e with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, in which I &s;at off for London, a|bout the hour of midnight; and, without granting a mo|ment's re&s;pite to the claims of hunger and watching, I tra|velled with &s;uch uncea&s;ing rapidity, that, on the third even|ing after my departure from our ho&s;pitable we&s;tern friends, I arrived at the dreary man&s;ions which contained all that my &s;oul held dear. I found him in a wretched apartment, &s;urrounded with, (as it appeared to me, unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch &s;cenes) every &s;pecies of mi&s;ery.&mdash;Deep de&s;pair marked his countenance; he &s;tarted when I entered, but in&s;tead of flying to embrace or con&s;ole me, kept his &s;eat and hid his face with a handkerchief.&mdash;I threw my arms pa&s;&s;ionately around him, and &s;hed floods of tears for his di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to|tally regardle&s;s of tho&s;e that mu&s;t inevitably await my&s;elf: I then endeavoured to whi&s;per con&s;olation, by directing his mind to hopes that had no exi&s;tence in my own; but he &s;eemed quite in&s;en&s;ible to all my tenderne&s;s, and with|out making any reply, put me gloomily from him: then &s;tarting from his &s;eat, he traver&s;ed the room in extreme agita|tion.

A hackney coach was then procured for me, and, unattended, I in&s;tantly went in pur&s;uit of this gentleman, guided only by a written direction from Dor|mer; and, after a long &s;earch through a variety of ob&s;cure places, attended by innumerable difficulties, I found him in a really deplorable habitation, &s;ituated in a narrow dirty lane, near one of the Inns of Court. His tall emaciated figure was rendered di&s;gu&s;ting by the paltry gaudine&s;s of his apparel; his coat had once been &s;carlet, but had acquir|ed a kind of dull purple from long &s;ervice; he had a blue &s;atin wai&s;tcoat loaded with tarni&s;hed embroidery, and &s;pangles; a pair of enormous buckles, where the copper peeped through their once glittering ve&s;t, ki&s;&s;ed the ground as he tottered toward me; an immen&s;e bag hung &s;u&s;pended by his few gray hairs, and a ru&s;ty military hat, adorned with a large cockade of the &s;ame complexion, lay on an old &s;opha, from which he aro&s;e at my entrance.

Dormer made him no reply, but turning ha&s;tily to me, whi&s;pered a reque&s;t that I would retire for a few moments, with which I in&s;tantly complied, and the keeper of the pri&s;on &s;ent his wife to attend me. In a &s;hort time I received a me&s;&s;age from Dormer, de&s;iring my return to his apartment. His vi&s;itor was gone, and my father's picture, with the bracelets and ring that had been my mother's, lay on the table. "I have &s;ent all but the&s;e, my love," &s;aid he, pointing to the dear memento's&mdash;"Your watch and all your jewels, which my friend a&s;&s;ures me will bring near three hundred pounds, and my debt is but a hundred and fifty, &s;o that the re&s;t may &s;upport us till I can do &s;omething better." &mdash;"Thank God!" I exclaimed, "who has made me the ble&s;t in&s;trument of your enfranchi&s;ement!"&mdash;"And thank you, my charming girl!"&mdash;he cried, pre&s;&s;ing my hand pa&s;&s;ionately to his lips. My tears dropped one by one on the bo&s;om of my riding &s;hirt, which was fa&s;tened in the middle with a pin that Granville Clifford had given me.

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. ELA TO MORTIMER.</HEAD>
<P>WITH a heart full of impatience I waited the return of Dormer's deputy.&mdash;Two days elap&s;ed in a &s;tate of fruitle&s;s and painful expectation, and we both expre&s;&s;ed our &s;urprize at the delay and &s;ilence of our &s;uppo&s;ed friend, in whom Dormer &s;till profe&s;&s;ed to repo&s;e the mo&s;t entire confidence. The third morning pa&s;&s;ed with|out our wi&s;hed-for vi&s;itor appearing. Dormer &s;eemed un|ea&s;y, but &s;aid little. I was extremely alarmed. I pro|po&s;ed paying a &s;econd vi&s;it to the habitation of his boa&s;t|ed friend, and with apparent reluctance he acquie&s;ced. On my arrival at the hou&s;e, I was informed by the peo|ple
<PB N="58" REF="021723_0061_0FB73E455D186CE0">
belonging to it, that their lodger had quitted them the evening of that day on which Dormer had entru&s;ted him with my jewels, telling them, that he was engaged to accompany a young nobleman in his travels through Europe&mdash;This intelligence almo&s;t di&s;tracted me. I could not conceal my emotions, but quitted the hou&s;e in &s;ilence I bur&s;t into tears as &s;oon as I was re-&s;eated in the coach, and wept pa&s;&s;ionately as it conveyed me back to the pri|&s;on.&mdash;Dormer flew to receive me, with a look of eager enquiry; but the traces of &s;orrow on my countenance rendered all other information needle&s;s. "Are we ru|ined, cheated, robbed?"&mdash;&s;aid he.&mdash;Then after a pau&s;e, he added, "Oh! yes, I know, I feel we are!&mdash;And what remains?"&mdash;"What indeed?" &s;aid I, endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s my tears. Dormer echoed my words, in an empa&s;&s;ioned tone, and &s;lung him&s;elf in an apparent agony into a chair. I &s;aid every thing that love like mine could &s;ugge&s;t to give him comfort and palliate the &s;everity of this blow; but the lo&s;s of liberty dwelt forcibly on his mind, and he was in&s;en&s;ible to all I could &s;ay. Near two years revolved in this &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s. The dear memento's of my revered parents, which Dormer had providentially re&s;erved from the &s;angs of that plau&s;ible devouring harpy, who had &s;o cruelly deceived us, were now appropriated to obtain the nece&s;&s;ary means of exi&s;t|ence; and I added &s;omething to the little &s;tip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd by my labours. The jail-keeper's wife was a humane being: &s;he gently &s;oothed my &s;orrows, and di&s;&s;ipated by her mild per&s;ua&s;ions many a gloomy thought. To her I was indebted for reaping both profit and amu&s;ement from the exertion of my unworthy talents. She procured painting, drawing, embroidery, and various kinds of needlework for me. I accquitted my&s;elf &s;o as to give general &s;atisfaction, and was liberally rewarded. Dor|mer wrote to all his relations, and many of tho&s;e that had profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves his friends; but not one of them conde&s;cended to take the &s;malle&s;t notice of his applications. The&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">peated di&s;appointments &s;unk deeply on his mind, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had a very unplea&s;ant effect on
<PB N="59" REF="021723_0062_0FB73E53A7B64E38">
his temper. I &s;ometimes experienced the con&s;equences of it; but my devoted heart never failed to offer a mul|titude of apologies in his behalf, "His pa&s;&s;ions are ar|dent."&mdash;I often mentally &s;aid&mdash;"His &s;en&s;ibility is ex|treme, and his tender fears on my account renders it more tremblingly alive to the &s;lighte&s;t touch. He would not feel thus for him&s;elf only. Shall I then reproach him for a fault ari&s;ing from an exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s for me? Shall I not rather forgive a caprice which flows from &s;o delightful a &s;ource, and endeavour to &s;often the wounds I have unde&s;ignedly inflicted? For me, the na|tural &s;weetne&s;s of his temper is injured; and &s;hall I cruel|ly dare, even in thought, to condemn him for what ori|ginates &s;olely with my&s;elf? Oh, no; let me endeavour to &s;ooth his perturbed &s;pirits, and gently lead him in|&s;en&s;ibly back to his native &s;erenity."</P>
<P>The&s;e were the reflexions that &s;upported me during the heavy hours of my Henry's confinement; at length the joyful hope of his enfranchi&s;ement darted its glad|&s;ome ray acro&s;s my mind. After many tedious delays, we received the little wreck of my once large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from Holland. Its amount was barely eleven hundred pounds.</P>
<P>I poured out ardent acknowledgments to Heaven, I invoked benedictions on the head of my Henry, as I de|livered into his hands the welcome &s;um. I know not the half I &s;aid, but I do not think that a moment of more &s;incere delight and lively gratitude ever vi&s;ited my heart. Henry &s;eemed touched by my enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the day concluded with a felicity from which I had long been e&s;tranged.</P>
<P>"To-morrow," &s;aid Henry, "to-morrow, my dear|e&s;t love, I &s;hall again ta&s;te the &s;weets of liberty."</P>
<P>Heaven knows with what &s;incerity I &s;hared his raptures, and eagerly anticipated the promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing. Henry, to-morrow, and liberty filled my whole &s;oul. The bli&s;s|ful words &s;eemed to fleet before my eyes in dazzling cha|racters, and &s;unk, with deep impre&s;&s;ion, on the tablets of my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="021723_0063_0FB73E57A42A29D8">I aro&s;e early the next morning to hail the welcome day and facilitate Dormer's enlargement. His debts were &s;oon di&s;charged, and after &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary forms, we quit|ted our dreary abode. The jail-keeper's wife &s;hed tears at our departure&mdash;&s;he was a worthy creature, and had formed a real attachment to me. I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly af|fected at her effu&s;ions of artle&s;s good will, and after pre|vailing on her to accept a trifling acknowledgment of her kind attentions, I left her with &s;en&s;ible regret.</P>
<P>We hired elegant apartments in a polite quarter of the metropolis, and Dormer laid out the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of what money remained from the payment of his debts, in purcha&s;ing that commi&s;&s;ion which he now holds. The private &s;olemnization of our nuptials was again pro|po&s;ed; but &s;ome unlucky circum&s;tance always &s;tarted up to delay its performance. Again Dormer applied re|peatedly to his numerous relations, but was equally un|&s;ucce&s;sful as before. It was at that period that the wor|thy Barlow was engaged in our &s;ervice. He one evening re&s;cued Dormer from a band of mercile&s;s &s;treet-robbers. My heart overflowed with gratitude: the hone&s;t creature told a tale of artle&s;s woe: I prevailed on Dormer to re|tain him in quality of a dome&s;tic, and amply were we re|warded by his fidelity, and marked attachment. Twice afterwards he &s;aved his ma&s;ter's life and mine, in the &s;hort cour&s;e of a fortnight; once from a daring party of hou&s;e-breakers, who&s;e weapons trembled at our throats when Barlow entered with the officers of ju&s;tice, and &s;eized every one of them: and a few days after, by &s;a|ving us, at the imminent danger of his own exi&s;tence, from the fury of a raging fire, which had con&s;umed all the under part of the hou&s;e ere we awaked; and our apartment was &s;inking in ruins when Barlow appeared at the window with a ladder of ropes, and conveyed me in his arms, to an adjoining hou&s;e. Thus calamity await|ed us which ever way we turned. Our lo&s;s was con&s;ider|able from the la&s;t misfortune. A trunk, containing a part of our cloaths and papers, &s;natched from the de|vouring flames by Barlow's vigilance, was all that e&s;caped de&s;truction. The extreme &s;hock that my &s;pirits received,
<PB N="61" REF="021723_0064_0FB73E65B5B0A100">
brought on a &s;evere and dangerous illne&s;s, during which time the unwearied attentions of Barlow far exceeded my highe&s;t prai&s;e. After a confinement of &s;ome weeks, I began again to recover. I experienced a chilling cold|ne&s;s and cruel neglect on the part of Dormer: the hu|mane William often witne&s;&s;ed it with tearful eyes. Whole days and nights would his ma&s;ter be ab&s;ent, while I was confined to the bed of &s;ickne&s;s; but I can with truth declare that a murmur never pa&s;&s;ed my lips. Dormer, I have now every rea&s;on to believe, at that time engaged in a new and not mo&s;t eligible &s;et of acquaintance, and perhaps by their baleful influence formed the cruel de&s;ign of de&s;erting me His nightly revels generally concluded with riot and intoxication. His noi&s;y a&s;&s;ociates often occa&s;ioned &s;hameful confu&s;ion at the door of our habitation: but he never introduced one of them to my pre&s;ence; and I now &s;uppo&s;e, if ever I was mentioned among them, it was, as being one of tho&s;e wretched females who live the &s;laves of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nfamy and lawle&s;s man.</P>
<P>Poverty &s;oon &s;tared us in the face with all its horrors. Barlow was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed unpaid. Clamorous demands for money perpetually a&s;&s;ailed us. We had run up a con|&s;iderable bill with the people of the hou&s;e, and all the terrors of a pri&s;on recurred to Dormer's mind, and filled him with di&s;traction. Often, in his frequent fits of fury and impatience, did I tremble le&s;t &s;ome act of de&s;pera|tion would en&s;ue. The produce of his commi&s;&s;ion was, to a man of his turn, too incon&s;iderable to be mentioned. It was barely &s;ufficient, he always declared, to pay his hair-dre&s;&s;er. In this dilemma he mentioned the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of leaving our lodgings clande&s;tinely, and propo&s;ed borrowing a trifling &s;um on his commi&s;&s;ion, and imploring the protection of our worthy friend in Cornwall, until the pre&s;ent &s;torm was overblown, and time unfolded brighter pro&s;pects to our view. I highly approved the latter part of his &s;cheme, but revolted at the thought of deliberate inju&s;tice. My &s;oul &s;tarted at the idea of wronging tho&s;e who had provided us the means of ex|i&s;tence, and tenderly admini&s;tered every comfort in their power to me, when agonizing on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s;
<PB N="62" REF="021723_0065_0FB73E6E38894828">
but the appearance of Barlow relieved my &s;truggles. He entered the room without waitin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for permi&s;&s;ion. A big tear &s;tood on his cheek. A variety of emotions labour|ed for utterance. He threw him&s;elf on his knees be|tween us, and drawing from his pocket a parcel, he laid it &s;oftly at my feet, &s;aying, in a low and interrupted voice, "Here, here, be&s;t of ladies, Heaven &s;ent it me for you," and ri&s;ing, he hid his face with the &s;kirt of his coat, and darted out of the room. I &s;tooped down and took up the parcel, which contained bank notes to the amount of two hundred pounds. Dormer &s;tood motionle&s;s with amazement, and a &s;ervant entered and gave him a pan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aining the&s;e words:</P>

<P>"Excu&s;e him!"

<P>"We mu&s;t, we mu&s;t," cried Dormer ha&s;tily, "in|deed we mu&s;t: to he&s;itate at &s;uch a time as this would be the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of madne&s;s." "But where," &s;aid I, "could he get it?" "That&punc;" replied Dormer, "there is no doubt of his accounting for very &s;ufficiently; and we &s;hall, I hope, be enabled to repay him." "How" I enquired. A cloud of pa&s;&s;ion aro&s;e on Dormer's brow He &s;tarted from his &s;eat, traver&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the room, muttered &s;omething, wherein I di&s;tinct|ly heard the words, "&s;crupulous, ab&s;urd, fool, trouble&s;ome, mad-woman"&mdash;and putting the notes in his pocket, he left me.</P>
<P>I &s;aw him no more until day-break the next morning, when &s;itting in my room, ruminating on the times that

were pa&s;t, he entered with haggard looks and wild di&s;or|dered air, and, cla&s;ping me frantickly in his arms, ex|claimed, "It is all over, Ela, it is all over!"&mdash;and &s;triking his forehead furiou&s;ly again&s;t the arm of my chair, he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the carpet. I gave a piercing &s;hri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k, and our guardian angel, Barlow, ru&s;hed into the room. He rai&s;ed Dormer from the floor. I know not what I &s;aid, but ca&s;ting on me a pitying look, he cried, "Tell me nothing, dear lady, I know all." "And what," &s;aid I, "do you know William?" "Know!" he exclaimed, "know that"&mdash;he pau&s;ed&mdash;"know enough," he added&mdash;"Oh! madam&mdash;but my ma&s;ter mu&s;t not &s;tay here&mdash;we mu&s;t get him away in&s;tantly." "Away,' &s;aid I, as my tears fell in torrents on Dormer's pallid face, "where would you take him away? William, William&punc; he is gone already!" "No!" he exclaimed, "but he mu&s;t be gone, or"&mdash;"What?" he repeated&mdash;"I will tell you another time&mdash;but we mu&s;t all go."&mdash;"Go!" I cried, "William, explain this my|&s;tery.&mdash;Where can we go now?" "Any where, Madam&punc;" he replied, "for &s;afety. Indeed we mu&s;t go without delay."</P>
<P>Dormer began to recover. He had wounded his forehead again&s;t the chair; and I, not till then, ob&s;erved his cloaths &s;tained with blood in many places. Barlow prevailed on him to drink a gla&s;s of wine and water; and whi&s;pering me that he would &s;oon return&punc; quitted the room. "I mu&s;t fly!" &s;aid Dormer, &s;uddenly &s;tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing from me, "or veng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance will find me."

<P>An humble lodg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng which Barlow had hired for him&s;elf when we di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, was now converted into our a&s;ylum; and during our melancholy wal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to it, he com|municated, at my repeated and earne&s;t importunity, the following dreadful information.

On his entrance he found him engaged in a warm conte&s;t: fortune was, as u&s;ual on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, very fluctuating; one moment &s;he poured heaps of gold into his lap, the next left him almo&s;t pennyle&s;s; till at length he was &s;tripped of all he had, and his lucky anta|goni&s;t refu&s;ed to play any more, although Dormer borrowed a guinea from one of the bye-&s;tanders.&mdash;Exa&s;perated at this conduct, and reduced by his ill-fortune to a &s;tate of de&s;pe|ration, Dormer &s;truck him; a &s;cuffle en&s;ued&mdash;&s;words were drawn, murder was echoed through the hou&s;e, Dormer e&s;caped, and Barlow was prevented from following imme|diately by his fears of creating &s;u&s;picion; he therefore mix|ed among the pur&s;uers, found they had no knowledge of our abode, and then ha&s;tened to give us every aid in his power, not doubting but Dormer would, ere long, be traced to our late lodging.</P>
<P>Judge you, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of genuine &s;en&s;ibility&punc; what my &s;ufferings mu&s;t have been as I li&s;tened to this &s;hocking relation. Murder and ruin re&s;ounded through my terrified imagination, and all the gentle palliatives that Barlow could invent were in&s;ufficient to &s;ooth my fears. In a &s;tate of mind, little &s;hort of in&s;anity, I reached the place that held the wretched Henry. There we &s;pent &s;ome mournful days; when our before propo&s;ed journey to the We&s;t was again mentioned as highly expedient, and Barlow highly approv|ed it.

I could not &s;peak&mdash;"Keep it, pray keep it, Madam," he added&mdash;"I only beg to &s;tay with you." "You &s;hall forever," cried Dormer, taking up the pocket-book that had fallen from my hand.

The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e entered, and informed Barlow, there had been two men below en|quiring if Captain Dormer lived there, but that &s;he had re|plied in the negative. Dormer changed countenance. Barlow thanked her caution, and put a guinea into her hand.</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t not continue here," &s;aid Dormer, as &s;oon as &s;he was gone. Barlow owned it to be un&s;afe. I was in|expre&s;&s;ibly alarmed; and it was agreed that we &s;hould ins|tantly &s;et off on our propo&s;ed expedition. Fully a&s;&s;ured of a cordial reception, I only penned a few lines to apprize our friends in the We&s;t of our de&s;ign, and we in&s;tantly de|parted. But when we arrived at the &s;pot where we had experienced &s;uch proofs of genuine friend&s;hip, we found the hou&s;e, where we hoped to have been welcomed by the&s;e generous villagers, uninhabited, and &s;ome neigh|bouring pea&s;ants informed us, that the lady had been many months in an ill &s;tate of health, and they were gone to re&s;ide in the South of France.&mdash;This was a heart-felt di&s;|appointment; at &s;uch a juncture it came with accumulated force.

<P>AFTER a con&s;iderable lap&s;e of time I again re&s;ume my pen to conclude the woe-fraught narration, which has &s;o greatly intere&s;ted the gentle heart of my Caroline; who, ever tremblingly alive to the claims of humanity, will, I am a&s;&s;ured, on that &s;core, pardon my long &s;ilence, and exculpate her brother from the charge of neglect.</P>

&s;triking le&s;&s;on of morality, and in&s;pires me with courage to &s;ubdue every reluctance, and obey the powerful im|pul&s;es of ju&s;tice and truth. Our journey to this place, in compliance with the earne&s;t wi&s;h of Ela, mentioned in my la&s;t, was &s;uch as you will ea&s;ily conceive. The truly excellent Barlow accompanied us, and &s;adne&s;s hovered around our little party. Ela's increa&s;ing weakne&s;s, and deep oppre&s;&s;ion of mind, occa&s;ioned many delays; when pa&s;&s;ing through a deep glen, as we drew near to our place of de&s;tination, the piercing &s;hriek of female di&s;|tre&s;s a&s;&s;ailed our ears, and a voice exclaimed, with mo&s;t affecting vehemence, "villain, mon&s;ter, tell me what is become of her!" Ela &s;tarted wildly, and &s;uddenly open|ing the door of the carriage, was going to jump out, regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences; but I prevented the exe|cution of this dangerous attempt, by catching her in my arms. She &s;truggled to elude my hold&mdash;"Cruel, cruel tyrants," &s;aid &s;he, "why will you keep me from him? Will none of you have pity?"&mdash;"And you too,"&mdash;added &s;he, looking at me with an expre&s;&s;ion of poignant an|gui&s;h&mdash;"will you detain me from the dear, dear injured," &mdash;&s;he could no more. Barlow pulled the &s;tring&mdash;the carriage &s;topped&mdash;the &s;creams &s;till continued. We lifted Ela out in our arms; and beheld at a &s;mall di&s;tance a confu&s;ed group, among whom was Dormer leaning again&s;t the &s;hattered trunk of an old tree, with his face conceal|ed between his hands, and the mo&s;t perfect manly form that ever before &s;truck my eyes, encircled in the arms of a lady from whom the &s;creams proceeded, were mo&s;t con&s;picuous. We could not di&s;cern either of their faces, but their figures were equal in &s;ymmetry. Ela withdrew her hand from mine, and darting from us, threw her&s;elf before them. They both cla&s;ped her alternately in their arms, with &s;ilent tran&s;port, and they mingled their tears together. I witne&s;&s;ed this &s;cene with emotions that cannot be de&s;cribed. Poor Barlow fell on his knees and prayed aloud, that there might not be any more mi&s;chief. Another lady, tall and maje&s;tie, appeared leaning on the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m of a &s;ervant to &s;upport her trembling

form. Her eyes wandered fearfully around her, but re&s;ting on Dormer&mdash;"What means this!" &s;he repeated|ly exclaimed&mdash;"Who are the&s;e&mdash;and why do they ac|cu&s;e you?"&mdash;"Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, hu&s;h," he cried, furiou&s;ly &s;natching up a pi&s;tol that lay at the &s;tranger's feet&mdash; "This an&s;wers all!" As he uttered the&s;e &s;carce articu|late words, the bullet pierced his raging brain, and he fell pro&s;trate before his interrogator. But all de&s;cription is unequal to the &s;cene that en&s;ued. Heart-rending &s;hrieks echoed through the air. Ela's empa&s;&s;ioned, un|conquerable love, &s;oared far above her wrongs: agoniz|ing with accumulated &s;ufferings, &s;he threw her&s;elf on the en&s;anguined earth, and folded the expiring Henry in her affectionate embrace, with a kind of frantic tenderne&s;s. His head re&s;ted on her bo&s;om, his eyes were eagerly rivetted on her face&mdash;The words "own, and only wife," died on his lips, which &s;till &s;eemed to beg forgivene&s;s. She be&s;ought Heaven to pity the &s;ad effects of a di&s;trac|ted moment&mdash;and graciou&s;ly extend his unbounded mer|cy to a crime, which no exce&s;s of wretchedne&s;s can ju&s;tify, nor any argument excu&s;e. In broken accents &s;he ble&s;&s;ed his fleeting &s;oul with welcome &s;ounds of pardon;&mdash;and what pre&s;umptuous mortal &s;hall dare to &s;can the un|&s;earchable depths of futurity? The &s;elf-devoted victim rai&s;ed him&s;elf with a look of penetrating horror on be|holding Barlow and my&s;elf:&mdash;we each extended our hands to him&mdash;his &s;pirit departed with a deep &s;igh; the remembrance of his crimes was ab&s;orbed in compa&s;&s;ion for his fate, and every atom in my frame trembled in uni|&s;on with the emotions of my heart.</P>
<P>Ela continued holding the corp&s;e in her arms; and with a look of fixed de&s;pair, repeated, in a deeply mournful voice&mdash;"it is over, oh, it is all over!" The elegant young man, who had &s;o greatly intere&s;ted me, quitted his fair companion, and kneeling be&s;ide Ela, hung over the woe-fraught &s;cene, while horror and heart-felt angui&s;h con|vul&s;ed the fine&s;t features, and mo&s;t faultle&s;s form that ima|gination can picture. The lady, who had demanded of the wretched Dormer an explanition of the my&s;tery before her, now lay &s;tretched on the earth, apparently as lifele&s;s as

The big drops &s;tole &s;lowly over Barlow's cheek, and I was unable to interupt the awful &s;ilence. My eyes were fixed on Ela, who&s;e attitude and looks no art can po&s;&s;ibly deline|ate: the quick tran&s;ition from all the wildne&s;s of horror to deep de&s;pair, that marked her countenance, &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the powers of language, and &s;ets de&s;cription at defiance. Her fine expre&s;&s;ive eyes, &s;eemed rooted in the firmament; then, with a &s;udden &s;tart, &s;he cla&s;ped her hands together, &s;unk on the bo&s;om of the hand&s;ome &s;tranger by her &s;ide, murmured out&mdash;"I go, I go, Clifford&mdash;ble&s;s me" and fell into &s;trong convul&s;ions His heart certainly complied with her reque&s;t; but his tongue refu&s;ed its concurrence. He held her &s;truggling in his arms, and his tears fell one by one on her pallid face. My &s;oul &s;eemed to echo the name of Clifford&mdash;I before believed it to be him&mdash;his amiable character was deeply engraved on my memory, and I con|templated with him a mixture of admiration and lively e&s;teem. The beauteous form, in who&s;e arms I fir&s;t beheld him&punc; approached us with agitated air and trembling &s;teps: the de&s;cription of Augu&s;ta St. Clare &s;tole upon my mind&mdash; never did I behold &s;uch delicacy, &s;uch animation, grace, &s;ymmetry, and elegance. She &s;tooped down, hung over the &s;truggling Ela, then rai&s;ed her &s;treaming eyes to Clifford and faintly exclaimed, "Here's de&s;olation!" "Retire&punc; my love," &s;aid Clifford&mdash;"pray quit this &s;cene; you are already ill. "I am," &s;he cried, leaning her head on her hand, "I am indeed ill; but where can I go?" She grew paler and paler. I rai&s;ed her in my arms&punc; a&s;&s;i&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by Barlow, placed her in one of the carriages, and left her to proceed &s;lowly onward to our de&s;tined place under his care. On my return, I found the other lady recovering. She poured a torrent of tears on the body of Dormer; then &s;uffering me to lead her from the mournful &s;cene, I &s;aw her &s;eated in her own chariot, and committing her to the care of one of her attendants, they followed the other carriage, and I re|turned to the &s;pot that held our poor lo&s;t Ela&punc; and her guardian friend. In our arms we conducted her to a neigh|bouring cottage; there &s;he continued near two days in a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e dreadful fits. After the nece&s;&s;ary

forms, Dormer's remains were depo&s;ited in the pari&s;h church-yard, and his death a&s;cribed by the voice of the law, to lunacy. Barlow brought us hourly intelligence of our fair fellow &s;ufferers, who were both ill, but he hoped not dangerou&s;ly, and his &s;ervices were extended to us all. Ela was at length re&s;tored to the bitter recollection of the pa&s;t. Her emaciated form was barely animated by exi&s;t|ence, and &s;he now really &s;eemed what &s;he before vainly &s;up|po&s;ed, incapable of feeling another pang. "The wounds of injured &s;en&s;ibility," &s;aid &s;he, as the la&s;t tear dropped from her eye, "are clo&s;ed forever.&mdash;I think my &s;ufferings are now over.&mdash;This poor deluded heart &s;eems callous to all that can en&s;ue"&mdash;&s;he pau&s;ed, "yes, dear Clifford," &s;he added, "you forgive me, promi&s;e likewi&s;e to bury my memory in oblivion, and be happy;&mdash;and the bitterne&s;s of death is pa&s;t." "Rather &s;ay," replied Clifford, tenderly &s;upporting her drooping form, "that you will endeavour to live and make us all happy." "Live!" &s;he faintly ex|claimed, "can my friend, my brother, wi&s;h me to live? Can Granville Clifford de&s;ire I &s;hould continue to groan un|der this heavy, heavy oppre&s;&s;ion?&mdash;Oh, mi&s;taken good|ne&s;s!&mdash; But no, no, Ela Spencer mu&s;t not, will not live." We were both too deeply affected to add any more; but, under the guidance of Barlow, &s;oon joined the re&s;t of our mournful party. The fair Augu&s;ta aro&s;e at our entrance, and after embracing Ela with tenderne&s;s, while the com|pa&s;&s;ionate tear bedewed her lovely face, Clifford pre&s;&s;ed her to his heart, and gazing alternately in each of their faces&mdash; "Oh!" &s;he eagerly exclaimed, "I have found a parent!" "And I," added her companion, approaching us with the milde&s;t dignity, "a long lo&s;t child; the oft lamented pledge of mutual attachment, the dear memento of my early, only love." "Yes, generous Clifford," &s;he added, after a pau&s;e, &mdash;"ble&s;&s;ed guardian of defencele&s;s innocence, if wealth and rank can gratify a mind like your's, they both await you, and you alone are wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hy to po&s;&s;e&s;s them."&mdash;A&s;to|ni&s;ment marked the features of Ela and Clifford; and Augu&s;ta &s;tood motionle&s;s be&s;ide them "Know," conti|nued her mother, "exalted &s;on of philanthropy," pointing to Augu&s;ta, "that when you took this unhou&s;ed wanderer to your arms, you wedded not Augu&s;ta St. Clare&punc; but

<P>OUR tragedy draws to a conclu&s;ion, the &s;orrows of Ela will &s;oon cea&s;e to exi&s;t, and the univer&s;al conqueror a&s;&s;umes a milder form than u&s;ual to conduct her to happier climes.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had di&s;patched my la&s;t letter to you, accom|panied by the truly noble Clifford, I ha&s;tened to the cham|ber that held our fair friends. Ela was &s;eated between them; her pallid cheek reclined on the &s;houlder of one, and the other &s;upported her in her arms. Their eyes dwelt with &s;oft compa&s;&s;ion on her face, and pen&s;ive &s;adne&s;s marked their inimitable features. It was a &s;cene for the heart, and I contemplated it &s;ome minutes without interruption. Clif|ford leaned his arm on my &s;houlder, uncon&s;cious, and a deep &s;igh &s;tole from him unob&s;erved by any but my&s;elf. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> gently rai&s;ed her languid eyes; we both approached her, and I can only judge of Clifford's emotions by my own.

<PB N="74" REF="021723_0077_0FB73EA5A9F973F0">
"at what I am going to propo&s;e&mdash;the marriage of Clifford and my charming friend, is imperfect in the eye of the law &mdash;and what time more proper than the pre&s;ent to have it continued?"&mdash;We were all &s;ilent &mdash; but our eyes revealed the eloquent language of our hearts&mdash;Ela's alone were dry &mdash;"Refu&s;e not," &s;he cried, looking alternately in the faces of Clifford and his I&s;abella, this la&s;t and only reque&s;t.&mdash; "Refu&s;e you?" repeated Clifford in impa&s;&s;ioned and in|terrupted accents, "Oh! who could refu&s;e you any thing?" She &s;miled &s;erenely on him, pre&s;&s;ed his hand gratefully to her lips, and &s;unk exhau&s;ted on the bo&s;om of the beauteous I&s;abella.</P>
<P>This la&s;t wi&s;h of Ela is now accompli&s;hed. A few hours &s;ince, the nuptials of the lovelie&s;t pair that &s;urely ever graced the Hymeneal temple, were again &s;olemnized&mdash;and the God attended with his brighte&s;t torch to illume the hou&s;e of mourning. Never &s;aw I, till now, a pair &s;o matched in excellence, &s;o equal in perfection; and although my pen can never give you a true idea of the impre&s;&s;ion, which the &s;cene I have ju&s;t quitted has left on my mind; I will en|deavour to trace &s;ome faint re&s;emblance of it. The ceremo|ny was performed in the chamber of Ela. The native charms of I&s;abella were heightened by the elegant &s;impli|city of her dre&s;s. She wore a fine India mu&s;lin, trimmed with narrow fringe, and lined with lilac, linen corre&s;pond|ent, and her fine auburn tre&s;&s;es turned &s;imply up under a large cap, which added delicacy to a &s;et of features, and complexion that &s;corns the power of imitation;&mdash;and as, with a graceful tenderne&s;s, &s;he gave her hand to Clifford and pronounced the &s;olemn vow, I &s;ent up a mental prayer that Heaven would ble&s;s me with &s;uch a bride;&mdash;for, like the lovely Roman, &s;he improves her charms,
<Q><L>"With inward Greatne&s;s, unaffected Wi&s;dom,</L>
<L>And &s;anctity of Manners."</L></Q>
Her mother, who is that lady, to obtain who&s;e gold, Dor|mer plunged into the deep aby&s;s of guilt, fate in pen&s;ive at|titude by Ela's &s;ide, while her eyes dwelt full of tender|ne&s;s on her amiable children. Clifford led his blu&s;hing bride toward her, and kneeling, pre&s;&s;ed her extended hand
<PB N="75" REF="021723_0078_0FB73EA747FF68B8">
to his lips; &s;he ble&s;&s;ed them both, and my heart felt the &s;cene too, too affecting.

<HEAD>LETTER V. MORTIMER TO CAROLINE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS day I have &s;hed the la&s;t tear over the lifele&s;s Ela, and &s;een it depo&s;ited be&s;ide the &s;ad remains of him, who&s;e penitence, though late and momentary, was, I hope, &s;incere, and found acceptance.</P>
<P>To-morrow we &s;et off for the &s;eat of Mrs. Barrymore, and &s;hall &s;oon ha&s;ten again to embrace my Caroline, and in her &s;ociety endeavour to conquer the dejection that now preys upon my mind.&mdash;I have ju&s;t parted with my amiable friends for the night; but &s;leep refu&s;es its gentle influence to &s;ooth my perturbed &s;pirits; and I will try to lo&s;e the painful &s;en&s;e of recent &s;cenes, by gratifying your amiable curio&s;ity, &s;o &s;trongly awakened to know the adventures of Clifford and I&s;abella.</P>
<P>The unwearied attention, and marked tenderne&s;s of that lovely woman, during a long and dangerous illne&s;s, which commenced previou&s;ly to the departure of Henry and Ela, and was greatly augmented and prolonged by that event, convinced him of what he had before &s;u&s;pected, that he had unde&s;ignedly attacked her heart.&mdash;The deva&s;tations of Hy|der-Ali &s;oon followed, and when he &s;aw her beauteous form rudely &s;eized by the hands of &s;avage tyrants, his heart loudly proclaimed her intere&s;t there. He flew, regardle&s;s of his own life, to her aid; but one of the barbarians &s;oon &s;tretched him, covered with wounds, at his feet, and were carrying them into a dreadful captivity, when a party of troops met them, and, after a long conte&s;t, obliged the &s;a|vages to fly, and re&s;cued all the pri&s;oners I&s;abella and Clifford were conducted to the hou&s;e of the commanding officer, where they re&s;ided &s;ome months, and perfect e&s;teem and tender admiration was ripened by gratitude into as lively a pa&s;&s;ion in the bo&s;om of Clifford as that by which I&s;abella was agitated. Heaven looked down well plea&s;ed on the virtuous union of congenial &s;ouls. Clifford received a &s;ummons from England; intimating that, from a &s;eries of remarkable events, a noble e&s;tate had devolved to him, and that his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;arily required to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="77" REF="021723_0080_0FB73EB673C138C8">
of it.&mdash;The hope of yet again beholding his once adored Ela, his lamented friend and &s;i&s;ter, rendered this acqui&s;i|tion doubly welcome. But his heart pronounced Augu&s;ta St. Clare arbitre&s;s of his future happine&s;s: without her par|ticipation he felt the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance that joy mu&s;t ever be a &s;tranger to his heart; and the gifts of lavi&s;h fortune be be&s;towed in vain. He flew to pour out the language of his generous &s;oul at her feet. A &s;tranger to affection, or ar|tifice, &s;he owned the intere&s;t he had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her heart; and &s;uperior to the &s;cruples and a&s;&s;umed delicacy of le&s;s exalted minds, permitted him the following day, to lead her blu&s;hing to the altar; and they immediately em|barked in the fleet that was ready to &s;ail for England.&mdash; Here their fruitle&s;s re&s;earches after Ela alone interrupted their felecity; when chance directed them to the &s;pot where Dormer and &s;he had experienced &s;uch friendly aid after their e&s;cape from the fury of the waves, and where they had been &s;o long detained with the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality. But here their hopes of tracing the fugitives were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful as before; and they were ha&s;tening back to the metropolis, when they overtook Dormer, and his de&s;tined bride, and the &s;cene already pourtrayed in&s;tantly en&s;ued. His intended union with Mrs. Barrymore was prevented by a delay, which te&s;tifies an over-ruling Providence, and for which &s;he now looks up with heart-felt gratitude. Deprived of her natural protectors, ere &s;he could be &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s, at a very early age, &s;he engaged the affections of a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed youth, the only &s;on of a wealthy family, to whom &s;he was nearly allied; but under who&s;e roof her childhood pa&s;&s;ed in a &s;tate of dependance much wor&s;e than &s;ervitude; a &s;tate which the delicate mind of my Caroline will readily conceive, and a good heart never fail to com|pa&s;&s;ionate.&mdash; The attachment was mutual, a private marri|age took place, the birth of I&s;abella led to a di&s;covery, and wretchedne&s;s en&s;ued. The tender wife was torn from the arms of her di&s;tracted hu&s;band, hurried, with her lovely infant, on board a ve&s;&s;el, and condemned to perpetual exile from the object of her fond attachment. There &s;he lan|gui&s;hed &s;ome years a &s;tranger to joy, but what aro&s;e from contemplating the &s;oftened features of her adored hu&s;band, vi&s;ible in her beauteous child; when the &s;udden account of
<PB N="78" REF="021723_0081_0FB73EBACC7099D0">
his death &s;eemed to complete the mea&s;ure of her woes. Long &s;he &s;tood trembling on the brink of eternity, wrapt in delirium; and the fir&s;t object her &s;en&s;es fought, was the &s;weet pledge of mutual love, the only &s;olace of her &s;orrow|ing widowhood. But the heart-rending intelligence, that death had likewi&s;e robbed her of that ble&s;&s;ing, excluded every ray of con&s;olation, and many years revolved in woe that would not admit of alleviation.&mdash;When, after repeated &s;truggles with her own heart, gratitude prevailed on her to reward the generous love of an amiable foreigner, and &s;he accompanied him to her native &s;hores; &s;he found that the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">durate parents of her adored Edward had not long &s;urviv|ed him, and the e&s;tate had devolved to a di&s;tant part of the family. She endeavoured to drown the remembrance of the pa&s;t in every &s;pecies of fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;ipation. Again &s;he became a widow; again was prevailed on to accept the golden fruits that Hymen offered&mdash;and ere &s;he attained her &s;ix and thirtieth year&punc; found her&s;elf again at liberty&punc; with an income of eight-thou&s;and a year. She then mentally re&s;olved no more to wear the hymeneal chain;&mdash;but how weak are female re&s;olutions? Her's was not proof again&s;t the arts of Dormer; when a &s;ummons from the per&s;on that &s;ucceeded to the e&s;tates of her loved Edward, reque&s;ting in&s;tantly to &s;ee her at his hou&s;e in Wales, to impart to her ere he died, a &s;ecret which lay heavy at his heart, delayed the promi&s;ed nuptials:&mdash;her lover murmured;&mdash;but her commands were ab&s;olute; and, with a very ill grace, be bowed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but was permitted to attend her. The dying penitent informed her, that her daughter was, by his hands, torn from her bo&s;om to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the inherit|ance to which he had long a&s;pired. That, under the name of Augu&s;ta St. Clare, &s;he was educated in a convent in France; that from a fear that her uncommon beauty and accompli&s;h|ments had attached the heart of his only &s;on, he had forced her to India &s;oon after her return; and that Heaven had pu|ni&s;hed his cruelty, by the full conviction of having murdered his child, who &s;urvived her lo&s;s but a few months, and de|clared, with his dying breath, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he died the victim of pa|rental rigor. The recital of this &s;tory &s;eemed deeply to af|fect Dormer. The well known name of Augu&s;ta, no doubt, brought bitter accu&s;ation to his heart. He mention|ed
<PB N="79" REF="021723_0082_0FB73EBC42117AE0">
the performance of their vows; but Mrs. Barrymore firmly declared, that until &s;he folded her long lo&s;t child in her arms, joy mu&s;t be a &s;tranger to her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>De&s;pairing of ever accompli&s;hing his wi&s;hes if &s;he held that determination, he called forth all his rhetoric to &s;hake it, but in vain. They bade adieu to Wales, and their jour|ney was a &s;cene of murmurings and altercation. When the &s;ound of Granville Clifford's voice re&s;ounded through his heart, he rai&s;ed his eyes, and beheld the dreaded interroga|tor, with the equally formidable Augu&s;ta by his &s;ide.&mdash;De&s;|peration at that moment &s;eized him, Clifford bade him alight;&mdash;he threw him&s;elf from the carriage&mdash;and aimed his &s;word at his brea&s;t; but their attendants interpo&s;ed, and the &s;equel you are already acquainted with.</P>
<P>Bereft of all her arts Vice &s;tands expo&s;ed in her native deformity. The Wi&s;dom of Virtue is no le&s;s con&s;picuous. The finger of Truth points at the folly of wickedne&s;s; and the inevitable mi&s;ery, by which it never fails to be attended, even in this world, is &s;urely &s;ufficient to deter every think|ing mind from the practice of it, without alluding to what mu&s;t as certainly await it in a future &s;tate.</P>
<P>Let us then, my dear &s;i&s;ter, remember that whol&s;ome medicine may be extracted from the mo&s;t poi&s;onous plants; and while &s;ympathy drops a tear over the grave of Ela, and &s;ilence throws a veil over the memory of Dormer, let us profit by their &s;ad example, and apply the warning voice to our hearts; and we &s;hall feel the &s;tronge&s;t conviction, that happine&s;s can never re&s;ide with depravity;&mdash;nor, however it may &s;uffer for a time, will the bo&s;om that rectitude inha|bits ever want a &s;upport. May the&s;e truths be indelibly engraven on the mind of my Caroline, is the ardent wi&s;h of</P>
