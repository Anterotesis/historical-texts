<P>WHEN we turn over the hi&s;toric page, and trace the ri&s;e and fall of &s;tates and empires; the mighty revolu|tions which have &s;o often varied the face of the world &s;trike our minds with &s;olemn &s;urprize, and we are naturally led to endeavor to &s;earch out the cau&s;es of &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing changes.</P>
<P>THAT Man is formed for <HI>&s;ocial life,</HI> is an ob&s;ervation which upon our fir&s;t enquiry pre&s;ents it&s;elf immediately to our view, and our rea&s;on approves that wi&s;e and generous principle which actuated the fir&s;t founders of civil government; an in&s;titution which hath its origin in the <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> of individuals, and hath for its end, the <HI>&s;trength and &s;ecurity</HI> of all: And &s;o long as the means of effecting this important end, are thoroughly known and religiou&s;ly attended to, Government is one of the riche&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings to mankind, and ought to be held in the highe&s;t veneration.</P>

IN young and new-formed communities, the grand de&s;ign of this in&s;titution is mo&s;t generally under&s;tood, and mo&s;t &s;trictly regarded; the motives which urged to the &s;ocial compact cannot be at once forgotten, and <HI>that</HI> equality which is remembered to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o lately among them, prevents tho&s;e who are cloathed with authority from attempting to invade the freedom of their Brethren; or if &s;uch an attempt is made, it prevents the community from &s;uffering the offender to go unpuni&s;hed: Every member feels it to be his intere&s;t, and knows it to be his duty, to pre&s;erve inviolate the con|&s;titution on which the public &s;afety depends<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Omnes ordines ad con&s;ervamdam rempublicam, mente, voluntate, &s;tudio, virtute, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;entiunt. <BIBL>Cicero.</BIBL></NOTE>, and is equally ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> in the execution of the laws, and the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> in defence of his right; and &s;o long as this noble attachment to a con&s;titution, founded on free and benevolent principles exi&s;ts in full vigor in any &s;tate, <HI>that</HI> &s;tate mu&s;t be flouri&s;hing and happy.</P>
<P>IT was <HI>this</HI> noble attachment to a free con&s;titution, which rai&s;ed ancient Rome from the &s;malle&s;t beginnings to that bright &s;ummit of happine&s;s and glory to which &s;he arrived; and it was the lo&s;s of <HI>this</HI> which plunged her from <HI>that</HI> &s;ummit into the black gulph of in|famy and &s;lavery. It was <HI>this</HI> attachment which in&s;pired her &s;ena|tors with wi&s;dom; it was <HI>this</HI> which glowed in the brea&s;ts of her heroes; it was <HI>this</HI> which guarded her liberties, and extended her dominions, gave peace at home and commanded re&s;pect abroad: And when <HI>this</HI> decayed, her magi&s;trates lo&s;t their reverence for ju&s;tice and the laws, and degenerated into tyrants and oppre&s;&s;ors&mdash;her &s;e|nators

forgetful of their dignity, and &s;educed by ba&s;e corruption, betrayed their country&mdash;her &s;oldiers regardle&s;s of their relation to the community, and urged <HI>only</HI> by the hopes of plunder and rapine, unfeelingly committed the mo&s;t flagrant enormities; and hired to the trade of death, with relentle&s;s fury they perpetrated the mo&s;t cruel murders, whereby the &s;treets of imperial Rome were drenched with her <HI>noble&s;t</HI> blood&mdash;Thus <HI>this empre&s;s</HI> of the world lo&s;t her dominions abroad, and her inhabitants di&s;&s;olute in their manners, at length became contented <HI>&s;laves;</HI> and &s;he &s;tands to this day, the &s;corn and deri&s;ion of nations, and a monument of this eternal truth, that PUBLIC HAPPINESS DEPENDS ON A VIRTUOUS AND UNSHAKEN ATTACHMENT TO A FREE CONSTITUTION.</P>
<P>IT was <HI>this</HI> attachment to a con&s;titution, founded on free and benevolent principles, which in&s;pired the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country:&mdash;They &s;aw with grief the daring outrages committed on the free con&s;titution of their native land&mdash;they knew that nothing but a civil war could at that time re&s;tore it's pri&s;tine purity.

AFTER various &s;truggles, which during the tyrannic reigns of the hou&s;e of STUART, were con&s;tantly kept up between right and wrong, between liberty and &s;lavery, the connection between Great-Britain and this Colony was &s;ettled in the reign of King William and Queen Mary by a compact, the conditions of which were expre&s;&s;ed in a Charter; by which all the liberties and immunities of BRITISH SUBJECTS were confirmed to this Pro|vince, as fully and as ab&s;olutely as they po&s;&s;ibly could be by any human in&s;trument which can be devi&s;ed. And it is undeniably true, that the greate&s;t and mo&s;t important right of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject is, that <HI>he &s;hall be governed by no laws but tho&s;e to which he either in per&s;on or by his repre&s;entative hath given his con&s;ent:</HI> And this I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, is the grand ba&s;is of Briti&s;h freedom; it is interwoven with the con&s;titution; and whenever this is lo&s;t, the con|&s;titution mu&s;t be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Briti&s;h con&s;titution</HI> (of which ours is a copy) is a happy compound of the three forms (under &s;ome of which all govern|ments may be ranged) <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Monarchy, Ari&s;tocracy, and Democracy: Of the&s;e three the <HI>Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature</HI> is compo&s;ed, and without the con&s;ent of each branch, nothing can carry with it the force of a law: In mo&s;t ca&s;es, either the ari&s;tocratic or the democratic branch may propo&s;e a law, and &s;ubmit it to the deliberation of the other two; but, when a law is to be pa&s;&s;ed for rai&s;ing a tax, that law can origi|nate only in the democratic branch, which is the Hou&s;e of Commons in Britain, and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives here&mdash;The rea&s;on is obvious: They, and their con&s;tituents are to pay much the large&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="012600_0008_0F8B3BBEE9DA66B8">
part of it, but as the ari&s;trocratic branch, which in Britain, is the Hou&s;e of Lords, and in this province, the Council, are al&s;o to pay &s;ome part, THEIR con&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary; and as the monarchic branch, which in Britain is the King, and with us, either the King in per&s;on, or the Governor whom he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to appoint to act in his &s;tead, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his own <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> which is <HI>that</HI> of all the &s;ubjects in general, HIS con&s;ent is al&s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and when the con&s;ent of the&s;e three branches is obtained, the taxation is mo&s;t certainly legal.</P>
<P>LET us now allow our&s;elves a few moments to examine the <HI>late acts of the Briti&s;h parliament for taxing America</HI>&mdash;Let us with candor judge whether they are con&s;titutionally binding upon us:&mdash;If they are, IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE let us &s;ubmit to them, without one murmuring word.</P>
<P>FIRST, I would a&s;k whether the members of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons are the Democracy of this Province? if they are, they are either the people of this province, or are elected by the people of this province, to repre&s;ent them, and have therefore a con|&s;titutional right to originate a Bill for taxing them: It is mo&s;t certain they are neither; and therefore nothing done by <HI>them</HI> can be &s;aid to be done by the democratic branch of our con&s;titution. I would next a&s;k, whether the Lords who compo&s;e the ari&s;tocratic branch of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, are Peers of America? I never heard it was (even in the&s;e extraordinary times) &s;o much as pretended,
<PB N="10" REF="012600_0009_0F8B3BBFA76962D0">
and if they are not, certainly no act of <HI>theirs</HI> can be &s;aid to be the act of the ari&s;tocratic branch of our con&s;titution. The power of the monarchic branch we with plea&s;ure acknowledge, re&s;ides in the King, who may act either in per&s;on or by his repre&s;entative; and I freely confe&s;s that I can &s;ee no rea&s;on why a PROCLAMATION <HI>for rai&s;ing money in America</HI> i&s;&s;ued by the King's <HI>&s;ole</HI> authority, would not be equally con&s;i&s;tent with our con&s;titution, and therefore equally binding upon us with the <HI>late acts of the Briti&s;h parliament for taxing us;</HI> for it is plain, that if there is any validity in <HI>tho&s;e acts,</HI> it mu&s;t ari&s;e altogether from the monarchical branch of the legi&s;lature: And I further think that it would be at lea&s;t as equitable; for I do not conceive it to be of the lea&s;t importance to us by <HI>whom</HI> our property is taken away, &s;o long as it is taken without our con|&s;ent; and I am very much at a lo&s;s to know by what figure of rhetoric, the inhabitants of this province can be called FREE SUB|JECTS, when they are obliged to obey implicitly, &s;uch laws as are made for them by men three thou&s;and miles off, whom they know not, and whom they never have impowered to act for them; or how they can be &s;aid to have PROPERTY, when a body of men over whom they have not the lea&s;t controul, and who are not in any way accountable to them, &s;hall oblige them to deliver up any part, or the whole of their &s;ub&s;tance, without even a&s;king their con&s;ent: And yet, whoever pretends that the late acts of the Briti&s;h parliament for taxing America ought to be deemed binding upon us, mu&s;t admit at once that we are ab&s;olute SLAVES, and have no property of our own; or el&s;e that we may be FREE-MEN, and at the &s;ame time under a nece&s;&s;ity of obeying the <HI>arbitrary commands of tho&s;e</HI> over
<PB N="11" REF="012600_0010_0F8B3BC06809FC18">
whom we have no controul or influence; and that we may HAVE PROPERTY OF OUR OWN, which is entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of ano|ther. Such gro&s;s ab&s;urdities, I believe will not be reli&s;hed in this enlightened age: And it can be no matter of wonder that the peo|ple quickly perceived, and &s;eriou&s;ly complained of the inroads which the&s;e acts mu&s;t unavoidably make upon their <HI>Liberty,</HI> and of the hazard to which their <HI>whole property</HI> is by <HI>them</HI> expo&s;ed; for, if they may be taxed without their con&s;ent even the &s;malle&s;t trifle, they may al&s;o without their con&s;ent be deprived of every thing they po&s;&s;e&s;s, although never &s;o valuable, never &s;o dear. Certainly it never entered the hearts of our ance&s;tors, that after &s;o many dangers in this then de&s;olate wilderne&s;s, their hard-earned property &s;hould be at the di&s;|po&s;al of the Briti&s;h parliament; and as it was &s;oon found that this taxation could not be &s;upported by rea&s;on and argument, it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary that one act of oppre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be enforced by another, and therefore, contrary to our ju&s;t rights as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or at lea&s;t having a ju&s;t title to po&s;&s;e&s;s, all the <HI>liberties</HI> and IMMUNITIES of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, a &s;tanding army was e&s;tabli&s;hed among us in time of peace; and evidently for the purpo&s;e of effecting <HI>that,</HI> which it was one principal de&s;ign of the founders of the con&s;titution to pre|vent, (when they declared a &s;tanding army in time of peace to be AGAINST LAW) namely, for the enforcement of obedience to acts which upon fair examination appeared to be unju&s;t and uncon|&s;titutional.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012600_0011_0F8B3BC126234288">
THE ruinous con&s;equences of &s;tanding armies to free communities may be &s;een in the hi&s;tories of SYRACUSE, ROME, and many other once flouri&s;hing STATES; &s;ome of which have now &s;carce a name! Their baneful influence is mo&s;t &s;uddenly felt, when they are placed in populous cities; for, by a corruption of morals, the public happine&s;s is immedi|ately affected; and that this is one of the effects of quartering troops in a populous city, is a truth, to which many a mourning parent, many a lo&s;t, de&s;pairing child in this metropolis, mu&s;t bear a very me|lancholy te&s;timony.&mdash;Soldiers are al&s;o taught to con&s;ider arms as the only arbiters by which every di&s;pute is to be decided between con|tending &s;tates;&mdash;they are in&s;tructed <HI>implicitly</HI> to obey their comman|ders, without enquiring into the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e they are engaged to &s;upport: Hence it is, that they are ever to be dreaded as the ready engines of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;And it is too ob&s;ervable that they are prone to introduce the &s;ame mode of deci&s;ion in the di&s;putes of individuals, and from thence have often ari&s;en great ani|mo&s;ities between <HI>them</HI> and <HI>the inhabitants,</HI> who whil&s;t in a naked defencele&s;s &s;tate, are frequently in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed by an armed &s;ol|diery. And this will be more e&s;pecially the ca&s;e, when the troops are informed, that the intention of their being &s;tationed in any city, is to OVERAWE THE INHABITANTS. That, <HI>this</HI> was the avowed de&s;ign of &s;tationing an armed force in this town, is &s;ufficiently known; and WE, my fellow-citizens have &s;een, WE have felt the tragical effects!&mdash;THE FATAL FIFTH OF MARCH 1770, CAN NEVER BE FOR|GOTTEN&mdash;The horrors of THAT DREADFUL NIGHT are but too deeply impre&s;&s;ed on our hearts&mdash;Language is too feeble to paint the emotions of our &s;ouls, when our &s;treets were &s;tained with the BLOOD

OF OUR BRETHREN,&mdash;when our ears were wounded by the groans of the <HI>dying,</HI> and our eyes were tormented with the &s;ight of the man|gled bodies of the <HI>dead.</HI>&mdash;When our alarmed imagination pre&s;ented to our view our hou&s;es wrapt in flames,&mdash;our children &s;ubjected to the barbarous caprice of the raging &s;oldiery&mdash;our beauteous virgins expo&s;ed to all the in&s;olence of unbridled pa&s;&s;ion,&mdash;our virtuous wives endeared to us by every tender tie, falling a &s;acrifice to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> wor&s;e than brutal violence, and perhaps like the famed LUCRETIA, di&s;|tracted with angui&s;h and de&s;pair, ending their wretched lives by their own fair hands.&mdash;When we beheld the authors of our di&s;tre&s;s parading in our &s;treets, or drawn up in regular <HI>battalia,</HI> as though in a ho&s;tile city; our hearts beat to arms; we &s;natched our weapons, almo&s;t re|&s;olved by one deci&s;ive &s;troke, to avenge the death of our SLAUGH|TERED BRETHREN, and to &s;ecure from future danger, all that we held mo&s;t dear: But propitious heaven forbad the bloody carnage, and &s;aved the threatned victims of our too keen re&s;entment, not by their di&s;cipline, not by their regular array,&mdash;no, it was royal GEORGE's livery that proved their &s;hield&mdash;it was that which turned the pointed engines of de&s;truction from their brea&s;ts.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I have the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to believe that I have mentioned the only circum&s;tance, which &s;aved the troops from de&s;truction. It was then, and now is, the opinion of tho&s;e who were be&s;t acquainted with the &s;tate of affairs at that time, that had thrice that number of troops, belonging to any power at open war with us, been in this town in the &s;ame expo&s;ed condition, &s;carce a man would have lived to have &s;een the morning light.</NOTE> The thoughts of vengeance were &s;oon buried in our inbred affection to Great-Britain, and calm rea&s;on dictated a method of removing the troops more mild than an immediate recour&s;e to the &s;word. With united

efforts you urged the immediate departure of the troops from the town&mdash;you urged it, with a re&s;olution which en&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;you obtained your wi&s;hes, and the removal of the troops was effected, without one drop of <HI>their blood</HI> being &s;hed by the inhabitants!</P>
<P>THE immediate actors in the tragedy of THAT NIGHT were &s;urrendered to ju&s;tice.&mdash;It is not mine to &s;ay how far they were guilty! they have been tried by the country and ACQUITTED of murder! And they are not to be again arraigned at an earthly bar: But, &s;urely the men who have promi&s;cuou&s;ly &s;cattered <HI>death</HI> amid&s;t the <HI>innocent</HI> inhabitants of a populous city, ought to &s;ee well to it, that they be prepared to &s;tand at the bar of an OMNISCIENT JUDGE! And all who contrived or encouraged the &s;tationing troops in this place, have rea&s;ons of eternal importance, to reflect with deep contrition on their ba&s;e de&s;igns, and humbly to repent of their impious machinations.</P>
<P>THE infatuation which hath &s;eemed for a number of years to prevail in the Briti&s;h councils with regard to us, is truly a&s;toni&s;hing!
