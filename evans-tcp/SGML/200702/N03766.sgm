</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the Jews returned from the Babyloni&s;h Captivity, they (according to the direction and commandment of Cyrus the King of Per&s;ia) laid the foun|dation of the hou&s;e of God at Jeru&s;alem, when &s;ome greatly rejoiced and others wept, as you may &s;ee in <HI>Ezra 1&s;t and 2d Chapters.</HI> But the Samaritans&punc; who were mortal Enemies to the Jews, by hiring Coun|&s;ellors and bribing &s;ome principal Per&s;ons at the Per&s;ian Court, greatly retarded the work:
<PB N="2" REF="004621_0003_100DAD492AC7B0D0">
So that from laying the foundation, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eems to have been but little done to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> fini&s;hing the hou&s;e until the &s;econd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Darius, which probably included the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> about &s;eventeen Years. When being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> up by the Prophets Haggai and Zechariah, and encouraged by the decree of Darius in their favour, the work went on again. In|deed, it &s;eems as if the ob&s;truction and oppo&s;i|tion they met with from their enemies was not the only Rea&s;on of the works cea&s;ing &s;o long as it did. Its probable they had the common Excu&s;e for not ingaging in and neg|lecting to pro&s;ecute Expen&s;ive Underta|kings, <ABBR>viz</ABBR> <HI>The difficulty &amp; hardne&s;s of the times</HI> Chap. 1. ver. 2. <HI>This people &s;ay, The time is not. come that the Lord's hou&s;e &s;hould be built.</HI> But &s;ays the Prophet, ver. 4. <HI>Is it time for you to dwell in your cieled hou&s;es, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hou&s;ely wa&s;t?</HI> As if he had &s;aid, <Q>You complain of the times, yet they have not been &s;o difficult, but that you have found means and oppor|tunity to build fine Hou&s;es for your &s;elves, tho' ye are content to let the Hou&s;e of God<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ly in Ruins.</Q></P>
<P>There are three things more e&s;pecially which the Prophet &s;ets before the Jews to excite them to this work. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That their neglecting of it &s;o long al|ready was the rea&s;on that they pro&s;pered no

better. They were bla&s;ted and the work of their hands not ble&s;&s;ed. <HI>Ye have &s;own much</HI> &s;ays the Prophet, <HI>and bring in little, ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye cloathe you, but there is n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ne warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put them into a bag with holes. Ye looked for much, and lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home I did blow upon it; Why? &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, becau&s;e of mine hou&s;e that is wa&s;te, and ye run every man unto his own hou&s;e, &amp;c.</HI> Chap. 1. ver. 6, 9, 10, 11.</P>
<P N="2">2. He promi&s;es them God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ble&s;&s;ing, Chap. 1. ver. 13. <HI>I am with you, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> And Chap. 2. ver. 19 <HI>From this day will I ble&s;s you.</HI> That is from the day they in|gaged vigorou&s;ly to carry on the work of God's hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. He encourages them to this work, by a&s;&s;uring them that the glory of this Hou&s;e &s;hould be greater than that of the former. They might be under di&s;couragement, when they con&s;idered how far this hou&s;e which they were about to build, would fall &s;hort of the fir&s;t Temple in beauty and glory. Ver. 3. of Context, <HI>Who is left among you that &s;aw this hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n her fir&s;t glory? And how do you &s;ee it now? Is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">t not in your eyes in compari&s;on of it as nothing?</HI></P>
<P>It was this that made the ancient men weep then the foundation of this latter hou&s;e was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, that it was like to be &s;o much le&s;s glorious
<PB N="4" REF="004621_0004_100DAD4B37D83808">
than the fir&s;t Temple. But to remove this difficulty and di&s;couragement, he a&s;&s;ures them that the glory of this latter hou&s;e &s;hould be greater than of the former, <HI>in our Text.</HI> But how this could or &s;hould be is the Que&s;tion For the former hou&s;e certainly exceeded the latter in Riches, magnificence of Building and external Ornaments, as well as divers tokens of the divine Favour, which the latter hou&s;e was de&s;titute of&punc; But the Que&s;tion admits an ea&s;ie Solution from our Text &amp; Context; and is ob|viou&s;ly this, <HI>That Chri&s;t the de&s;ire of all Nations&punc; &s;hould during the &s;tanding of this &s;econd Temple or latter Hou&s;e, come and honour it with his Pre&s;ence</HI> Ver. 6, 7, 8, 9. <HI>For thus &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I will &s;hake the hea|vens, and the earth, and the &s;ea, and the dry land And I will &s;hake all nations, and the de&s;ire of all nations &s;hall come, and I will fill this hou&s;e with glory &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts.

Advocate to make Interce&s;&s;ion for them, and may therefore de&s;ervedly be &s;tiled the De|&s;ire of all Nations; and I will fill this Hou&s;e with glory&punc; For tho' the former Temple was very famous for many extraordinary things, for the Ark of the Covenant, the U<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">im and Thummim, a va&s;t profu&s;ion of Silver and Gold, and the Angelical appearance on the Mercy-&s;eat: Yet all the&s;e &s;hall be nothing in compari&s;on of that Glory which &s;hall re|dound on the pre&s;ent Temple, when this divine Per&s;on &s;hall vouch&s;afe to grace it with his Pre&s;ence, as he certainly &s;hall do, during its &s;tanding.

<P><HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple had the advantage of the latter Temple in many re&s;pects, its external Ornaments were more; its Workman&s;hip was exceeding Curious, its Overlayings va&s;t and prodigious; and there were al&s;o &s;ome Extra|ordinary marks of the divine Favour in it, which were not in the latter, as the Ark of the Covenant, in which were put the Tables of the Law and the Mercy-&s;eat, which was upon the Ark: There was al&s;o tho &s;ymbol of the divine Pre&s;ence in a vi&s;ible Cloud that re&s;ted over the Mercy-&s;eat: The Urim &amp; Thummim, by which the high-Prie&s;t con&s;ulted God in difficult and momentous Ca&s;es relating to the publick Intere&s;t of the Nation, and al&s;o the holy Fire which came down from heaven upon the Altar, at the con&s;ecrating of the fir&s;t Temple.

to render the fir&s;t Temple glorious: But yet CHRIST's Pre&s;ence in the latter, rendred it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ore glorious than the former. The Pre&s;ence of this glorious Per&s;on, rendred the latter Hou&s;e (which in the eyes of &s;ome of the Jews was as nothing) far more glorious than the former.</P>
<P>But in the pro&s;ecution of the Doctrine, I &s;hall con&s;ider and endeavour to &s;hew,</P>
<P>I. <HI>In what manner we may expect CHRIST's Pre&s;ence in a Hou&s;e of publick Wor&s;hip.</HI> And,</P>
<P>II. <HI>How his Pre&s;ence renders it truly glorious.</HI></P>

He a&s;&s;ured his Di&s;ciples that he would be with them always to the end of the world, <HI>Mat</HI> 28. 20. And in Mat 18. 20. He &s;ays, <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them.</HI> Tho' we are not now to expect his bodily Pre&s;ence in our wor|&s;hipping A&s;&s;emblies, yet his &s;piritual Pre&s;ence we may, in hou&s;es &s;et apart to honour &amp; wor|&s;hip this our Redeemer in. His Spirit is the Comforter, which before he left the world he promi&s;ed &s;hould abide with his Di&s;ciples for+ever, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14 16, 17, 26.

<P>But I proceed,</P>

<P><PB N="9" REF="004621_0006_100DAD4EDE7E7908">
Its curious Workman&s;hip and external Or|naments may give it a &s;plendid &amp; magnificent appearance, and render it in &s;ome re&s;pects glorious: But the true and greate&s;t glory of it is the Pre&s;ence of CHRIST in it. The pre|&s;ence of a Per&s;on of &s;uch Dignity, Excellency &amp; Glory, graces and adorns it, va&s;tly beyond what the Art of man in its greate&s;t perfection can do.</P>
<P>But particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CHRIST's Pre&s;ence renders a Hou&s;e of pub|lick Wor&s;hip glorious, as it a&s;&s;i&s;ts and enables the Wor&s;hippers there, to wor&s;hip God in an Acceptable manner.</HI> Its the honour and glory of a hou&s;e of publick Wor&s;hip, when the End and de&s;ign of its Erection is obtained; when God is wor|&s;hipped in it in &s;uch a manner as is acceptable to him; that is, <HI>in &s;pirit and in truth;</HI> for &s;uch it is that the Father &s;eeks to wor&s;hip him.

Without him all our acts of Wor&s;hip will be of no &s;ignificancy: But thro' him we may find acceptance; our offerings come up as a &s;weet &s;avour before the Lord. That wor&s;hip that is in&s;incere, hypocritical, or on any account un|acceptable unto God, is very far from doing any honour to a hou&s;e of publick Wor&s;hip: But that wor&s;hip which God accepts and ma|nife&s;ts

<P N="2">2. <HI>CHRIST's Pre&s;ence renders a Hou&s;e of publick Wor&s;hip glorious, as it is by that, that the preaching of the word there is made Effectual for the Conviction and Conver&s;ion of Sinners and the Edi|fying of Saints.</HI> Its owing to the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, by his Spirit, when the word of God di&s;pen&s;ed in his Hou&s;e becomes like a fire and a hammer, breaking the rocky hearts of &s;inners in pieces: Its owing to this when it is quick and powerful, &s;harper than a two edged &s;word, piercing even to the dividing a&s;under of &s;oul &amp; &s;pirit, joints &amp; marrow: When its mighty to the pulling down of &s;trong holds, ca&s;ting

It contributes much to the glory of an hou&s;e of publick Wor&s;hip, when multitudes are Converted there; when many are taught the good knowlege of the Lord, and are brought to a &s;aving acquaintance with Je&s;us Chri&s;t: When converts as a Cloud and as Doves to their windows are ha&s;tning thi|ther: When of this and that man it may be &s;aid, <HI>That he was born there.</HI> Such a hou&s;e then becomes a Seminary for Heaven, a Nur&s;ery of Plants for the Cele&s;tial Regions, a Garden of the Lord. Here the &s;inner is Converted, the &s;aint Edified; here he finds &s;piritual Con&s;ola|tion and that Refre&s;hment that makes him grow in grace; and all this becau&s;e Chri&s;t is there. And tho&s;e happy and glorious Effects of the word preached there, renders &s;uch an hou&s;e glorious in the &s;ight of Angels &amp; Men: Put a lu&s;tre and beauty upon it, &s;o that &s;uch as pa&s;s by and ob&s;erve it will be ready to &s;ay as Jacob in another ca&s;e, <HI>Surely God is</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen,</HI> 28. 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>in this place; this is none other but the hou&s;e of God, and the gate of Heaven.</HI> From &s;erving and prai&s;ing God in &s;uch an Hou&s;e, many are frequently pa&s;&s;ing into Heaven, there to &s;erve, glorifie &amp;

prai&s;e the &s;ame Almighty Being, whom they have loved and honoured here below.

<P N="3">3. <HI>The Pre&s;ence of CHRIST in a Hou&s;e of pub|lick Wor&s;hip renders it glorious, as it renders the Sacraments there admini&s;tred, plea&s;ant, de&s;irable and beneficial.</HI> The Sacraments of Chri&s;ts In|&s;titution, are Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Unbelief &amp; hardne&s;s of Heart.</HI> When per|&s;ons repeatedly refu&s;e an offer'd Saviour; when they will not believe in him; tho' they have greater Evidence of his being the Me&s;&s;iah and Saviour of the world, than they would have &s;hould one ri&s;e from the dead and tell them &s;o.

This cau&s;es him to with-hold or withdraw the gracious &amp; powerful Influence and Efficacy of his Spirit from them. He does not think fit to continue it where its &s;o &s;lighted &amp; di&s;regarded. Thus we find that it was be|cau&s;e of their Unbelief, that Chri&s;t did not many

<P N="2">2. Another thing that tends to prevent or deprive us of Chri&s;t's gracious Pre&s;ence, and which we &s;hould therefore be careful that it be not found with us, is, <HI>An Unpeaceable &amp; Contentious, &s;pirit.</HI> Chri&s;t is a Prince of peace, and has taught his followers to be at peace among&s;t them&s;elves, To &s;tudy to be quiet, and to do their own bu&s;i|ne&s;s.

<P N="3">3. Another thing of the like unhappy ten|dency, &amp; which we &s;hould be watchful again&s;t, is, <HI>A &s;pirit of I difference about, Carele&s;sne&s;s, Levity and Rudene&s;s in God's Hou&s;e in times of publick Wor|&s;hip.</HI> When per&s;ons are indifferent &amp; carele&s;s about the publick Wor&s;hip, are little concern'd whether they attend it or no, it di&s;covers want of love to Chri&s;t and a low e&s;teem of his graci|ous Pre&s;ence: And when in the Hou&s;e and at the times of publick Wor&s;hip, their behaviour is irreverent &amp; rude; when they indulge them|&s;elves
<PB N="23" REF="004621_0013_100D83C951954438">
in &s;porting and play, they de&s;erve to be treated in the manner that Chri&s;t treated them that bought and &s;old in the Temple, when making a &s;courge of &s;mall cords he drave them out of it. For by &s;uch behaviour they defile the Hou&s;e of publick Wor&s;hip &amp; provoke Chri&s;t to withdraw his <HI>gracious Pre&s;ence</HI> from it Let us then be very careful that we don't by any of the&s;e things prevent <HI>Chri&s;t's gracious Pre&s;ence</HI> coming in|to this Hou&s;e, nor provoke him to withdraw it if once he vouch&s;afes to favour us with it.</P>
<P>V. <HI>From what has been &s;aid, we may learn in what manner every one may be In&s;trumental in ren|dring this Hou&s;e glorious; and that is by their &s;incere and con&s;tant Endeavours to engage the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in it.</HI> It's that (as we have heard) that will render it truly glorious. They at who&s;e Expence it has been Set up and rendred &s;o Con|venient for the publick Wor&s;hip to be perfor|med in, have done well, and God will, no doubt, think upon them for good according to all they have done for him; He will remember them concerning this, and not wipe out their good deeds that they have done for the Hou&s;e of their God. But in this Expence every one has not been Equally intere&s;ted: But in their En|deavours to render this Hou&s;e truly glorious, the Poor may do as much as the Rich, the Low as much as the High, the Young as much as the Old; all Ages, Sexes and Ranks may here unite

in their &s;incere Endeavours to engage the Pre|&s;ence of the King of Glory here, who&s;e Pre|&s;ence will be its greate&s;t Ornament and Glory.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>From what has been &s;aid we learn, That al|though this Hou&s;e in outward re&s;pects, be much more beautiful &amp; glorious than the former Hou&s;e, in which we and our Fathers before us, were wont to Wor&s;hip God, Yet unle&s;s Chri&s;t's Pre&s;ence be with us in this, it will be far le&s;s glorious than that.</HI> It doubtle&s;s affects us with &s;ome degree of plea&s;ure &amp; &s;atis|faction, to &s;ee how much this latter Hou&s;e Ex|ceeds the former in External beauty &amp; glory; and may &s;erve to wipe off the Reproach which &s;ome have been ready to ca&s;t upon us, <HI>As Ho|nouring the Law more than the Go&s;pel;</HI> by rea&s;on of the decayed and ruinous &s;tate in which the Hou&s;e of God for a long time lay. But yet if Chri&s;t be not with us here, the glory of this Hou&s;e will be far le&s;s than the glory of the for|mer: For we have heard with our Ears and our Fathers have told us, how Chri&s;t was gra|ciou&s;ly Pre&s;ent with them there. Tho' they built that Hou&s;e in troublous times, When labouring under the pre&s;&s;ing difficulties that a howling Wilderne&s;s expo&s;ed them to&punc; and when encompa&s;&s;ed with numerous &amp; barbarous Enemies: Yet there they found Chri&s;t was with them in his Hou&s;e and Ordinances, and in tho&s;e Eminent Lights that &s;hone among them, who&s;e Prai&s;e is yet in the Churches.
