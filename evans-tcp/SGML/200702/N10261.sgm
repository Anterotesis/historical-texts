<P>TWO SERMONS: THE FIRST FROM PSALM CII.19, 20. DELIVERED THE LORDS-DAY BEFORE THE EXECUTION OF LEVI AMES. WHO WAS EXECUTED AT BOSTON, THURSDAY OCTOBER 21. FOR BURGLARY. Aet. 22. &rindx;This Di&s;cour&s;e was preached at the De&s;ire of the Criminal, who al&s;o attended on the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE SECOND FROM PROVERBS XVII.25. Preached the Lords-Day after his Execution; and de&s;igned as an Improvement of that awful E|vent, by Way of Caution to others.</P>
<P>TO WHICH IS ADDED, At the Reque&s;t of many, An Account of the Exerci&s;e of his Mind, from the Time of his Condemnation, till he left the World; together with the Con|ver&s;ation the Author had with him as he walked with him from the Pri&s;on to the Gallows. By all which, compared with his latter Conduct, he may be thought in a Judgment of Charity, to have died, A Penitent Thief.</P>

<Q><BIBL>PSALM CII.19, 20.</BIBL>
<P>For he hath looked down from the height of his Sanctuary: From Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth:</P>
<P>To hear the groning of the Pri&s;oner, to loo&s;e tho&s;e who are appointed to Death.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE youth on who&s;e account I have cho&s;en this pa&s;&s;age, for the la&s;t time appears in this a&s;&s;embly. Before we &s;hall meet here again for public wor&s;hip, he will be numbred with the dead: That body now bound in chains, will be committed to the du&s;t, and his immortal &s;pi|rit have pa&s;&s;ed to the throne of God, to receive an irrevocable &s;entence. This circum&s;tance cannot fail of promoting an uncommon &s;olemnity through this great congregation, and of exciting compa&s;&s;ion towards the pri&s;oner in every humane brea&s;t. A &s;mile on any countenance on this occa&s;ion, will be looked upon as an evidence of a want of humanity. And I take it for granted, that tho&s;e of you who have believed in Je&s;us, who know the con&s;olations which his religion affords, and are acquainted with the value of an immortal &s;oul, will a&s;&s;i&s;t the preacher
<PB N="6" REF="013030_0004_0F8FB2179E4CCE30">
by your prayers; that the word may be &s;poken as becomes the oracles of God, and prove of infinite advantage to the multitude, and e&s;pecially to this poor young man. If ever plainne&s;s, zeal, and an artle&s;s addre&s;s were nece&s;&s;ary, it is now; when, a|mid&s;t a crowd of dying men, there is one, who knows not only the day, but the hour, yea <HI>minute</HI> of his di&s;&s;olution. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, where &s;hall &s;upport be found? Only, my brethren, in the religion of the bible; which amply declares the grace, and conde|&s;cen&s;ion of Jehovah, who <HI>looked down from the height of his &s;anctuary: From heaven did the Lord behold the earth, to hear the groning of the pri&s;oner, to loo&s;e tho&s;e who are appointed to death.</HI>&mdash;The very title of this p&s;alm di&s;covers its &s;uitablene&s;s to the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion: It is &s;aid to be,
<Q>a prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his &s;oul before the Lord.</Q>
We may well &s;uppo&s;e, that this unhappy youth never knew before, &s;uch an affliction as the pre&s;ent; which he hath indeed brought upon him&s;elf, by repeated in&s;tances of theft and robbery: Yet is he the object of our pity and prayers, and may be the &s;ubject of the free forgivene&s;s of God in Chri&s;t; &s;eeing the abounding of &s;in has been exceeded by the &s;uperabundance of divine grace. And admitting that the pri&s;oner has a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his guilty condition before God, he will pa&s;&s;ionately adopt the language of the context, <HI>Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee. Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble, incline thine ear unto me. My heart is &s;mitten, and withered like gra&s;s, &s;o that I forget to eat my bread,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>After the p&s;almi&s;t had thus de&s;cribed the ca&s;e of the afflicted, he brings to mind the following com|fortable
<PB N="7" REF="013030_0005_0F8FB2186B957880">
con&s;iderations; &s;uch as the eternity and kindne&s;s of the Lord, who will <HI>regard the prayer of the de&s;titute&punc; and not de&s;pi&s;e their prayer. This,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall be written for the generation to come; and the people who &s;hall be created, &s;hall prai&s;e the Lord.</HI> Meaning that God's readine&s;s to hear the crys of his people&punc; &s;hall be duly remembred; and that all &s;uch as are created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall prai&s;e Him for this in&s;tance of his conde&s;cen&s;ion. And in the text he enlarges on the &s;ame &s;ubject, which he had mentioned, ver. 17. in order to &s;hew that the Lord is &s;o far from di&s;regarding the prayer of the de&s;titute, that He li&s;tens attentively to their cry, and will grant deliverance. The Lord takes a general notice of the earth, and its inhabitants, but is particularly attentive to the mourning of <HI>Ephraim</HI>; or to the afflicted &s;tate of his people: For the com|fort of &s;uch the text is evidently de&s;igned. In the fol|lowing part of the di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall not &s;trictly confine my&s;elf to the primary &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age; but expect your indulgence, while I introduce &s;uch reflections, as may be pertinent to this &s;olemn &s;cene.

<P><HI>David,</HI> as one ob&s;erves on the place, has a parti|cular re&s;pect to the condition of believers under per&s;ecuting princes; by whom many have been
<PB N="8" REF="013030_0006_0F8FB218FA72E018">
impri&s;oned, and put to death, for their attachment to the Lord, and to the te&s;timony of Je&s;us: Who, according to both &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory, have been &s;en&s;ibly &s;upported, and have thereby triumphed gloriou&s;ly, to the confu&s;ion of their enemies. But there are different &s;en&s;es, in which it may be &s;aid that mankind are <HI>pri&s;oners,</HI> and <HI>appointed to death.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. This, O <HI>Ames,</HI> is your unhappy ca&s;e in a literal &s;en&s;e. You have been tried by the law of your country, found guilty, received &s;entence of death, and are now waiting in clo&s;e impri&s;onment, the day of your execution. In this view your condition is gloomy; my &s;oul feels for you; and the crowd who behold you, evidently di&s;cover their &s;ympathy with you.</P>
<P N="2">2. But there is a more awful &s;en&s;e, in which it may be &s;aid, that you, and all mankind <HI>as &s;inners</HI> are pri&s;oners, and appointed to death, I mean <HI>as tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors of the law of God, holden by the cords of ini|quity, and led captive by the devil at his will.</HI></P>
<P>When JEHOVAH created man, He gave him a law to be the rule of his temper and conduct; the requi&s;ition of which was <HI>perfect conformity:</HI> Which conformity involved the tempers of the heart, and the actions of the life. To this law were annexed rewards and puni&s;hments. He who doth the things required &s;hall live by them; but he who fails in a &s;ingle in&s;tance &s;hall be condemned. However &s;ome may trifle with the extent, and &s;pirituality of the di|vine law, it is as true as God's exi&s;tence, that he <HI>who LOOKETH ON a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath com|mitted adultery already with her IN HIS HEART.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. 5.28.</NOTE>
<PB N="9" REF="013030_0007_0F8FB219B8A22758">
A lo&s;tful look, ob&s;erve, is heart adultery. Hence &s;aid <HI>Paul, I had not known lu&s;t, except the law had &s;aid, Thou &s;halt not covet.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 7.7.</NOTE> If we admit the truth of revelation, we &s;hall find no method of evading this plain, but awful conclu&s;ion, that the law of God is <HI>exceeding broad,</HI> reaching to, and condemning for the irregularities, or &s;ins of our hearts: And that too, not only for <HI>many</HI> &s;uch in&s;tances of trangre&s;&s;ion, but for <HI>one. Cur&s;ed is every one who continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gal. 3.10.</NOTE> To which add, <HI>That who|ever keepeth the whole law, and offendeth in one point, is guilty of all.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. 2.10.</NOTE> i. e. He who hath broke one com|mand, is certainly a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law; though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that there were other precepts which he had not violated. The apo&s;tle explains him&s;elf in this manner in the ver&s;e following the words ju&s;t read. <HI>For He who &s;aid, Do not commit adul|tery; &s;aid al&s;o, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or of the law</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus from the current language of the holy &s;crip|tures, we learn, that the law of God reaches to the thoughts and intents of the heart, and that mankind &s;tand condemned by it, for thinking evil, as well as for committing it openly. And this circum&s;tance e&s;&s;entially di&s;tingui&s;hes the <HI>divine</HI> from <HI>human</HI> laws. The latter can never accu&s;e us for wrong tempers, but only for actions: The former have as much to do with di&s;po&s;itions of the heart, as with any exter|nal behavior. And thus it is right it &s;hould be;
<PB N="10" REF="013030_0008_0F8FB21A9C6D0DC8">
thus it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be, if we admit that the law of God is the tran&s;cript of his own nature; and that He as &s;urely requires truth in the <HI>inward part,</HI> as that we &s;hould obey Him in our lives. This we cannot po&s;&s;ibly deny, while we con&s;ider that the infinite God is of purer eyes, than to behold evil with the lea&s;t approbation: It is the thing his &s;oul hateth. And He is &s;aid <HI>to know our thoughts afar off.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears that all mankind are &s;hut up un|der the law, to the cur&s;e of which they are mo&s;t righteou&s;ly expo&s;ed: For <HI>all have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the glory of God.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides their unhappy ca&s;e on the preceding account, they are <HI>holden by the cords of their iniqui|ties.</HI> Scripture and experience unite to convince us, that &s;in has <HI>dominion</HI> over the &s;ons of <HI>Adam.</HI> Hence it is that they go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they are born, &s;peaking lies. The power of &s;in over the fallen race, is mo&s;t manife&s;t in its <HI>univer&s;al prevalence.</HI> In every age, and in every country, vice has prevailed; while but a few have appeared to be under the influence of right tempers.</P>
<P>The &s;acred oracles repeatedly a&s;&s;ure us of this truth; and it is the plain meaning of the prophets words. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 13&punc; 23.</NOTE> <HI>Can the Etheopian change his &s;kin, or the Leopard his &s;pots? Then may ye al&s;o do good, who are accu&s;tomed to do evil.</HI> The former is <HI>naturally</HI> impo&s;&s;ible, and the latter <HI>morally</HI> &s;o; becau&s;e the principle of &s;in has &s;uch power over the minds of men, that they love it, and after it they will go. This &s;hocking truth has been experienced by many, in the following re|&s;pect, viz. when con&s;cience has been alarmed, and
<PB N="11" REF="013030_0009_0F8FB21B2F3D3B30">
the &s;inner obliged, in order to quiet its clamors, to make the mo&s;t &s;olemn re&s;olutions again&s;t his former conduct; he has no &s;ooner met with a temptation to the &s;ame iniquity, than he hath complied with it. Such <HI>power</HI> has &s;in had over him, that he hath many times &s;inned again&s;t the light of his own con&s;cience, and all his &s;olemn re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>This powerful principle of indwelling &s;in, is repre|&s;ented by an in&s;pired apo&s;tle, in the following terms; <HI>a law in the members&mdash;the old man&mdash;the body of death.</HI> And I may &s;afely affirm, that the experience of all real believers, has been the &s;ame with St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s in this matter. They feel that &s;in has the <HI>force of a law</HI>; and that they are too often led into captivity by it, to their own un&s;peakable &s;orrow.</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of this <HI>powerful</HI> principle in the minds of believers, is the great cau&s;e of that &s;piritual warfare which they are daily carrying on, and of which they abundantly complain. In fact, while the chri|&s;tian is at home in the body, he is in a &s;tate of im|pri&s;onment; he groans earne&s;tly for deliverance, nor will he ever be &s;atisfied till he awakes in the image of his God.</P>
<P>Now the great difference between the believer, and the unbeliever in this matter is, that the former feels and laments his body of &s;in, and oppo&s;es it: The latter, is in love with &s;in, and complies with its dic|tates. He yields to its power to his own ruin; un|le&s;s the arm of the Lord is revealed to &s;lay his enmi|ty, and deliver him from the law in his members.</P>
<P>To which I add, as that which compleats the &s;inner's &s;ad condition, that he is <HI>led captive by the
<PB N="12" REF="013030_0010_0F8FB21D557A61F0">
devil at his will.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6.</NOTE> Who is &s;aid to <HI>walk about like a roring lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 5.8.</NOTE> And to <HI>work in the children of di&s;obedience,</HI> with this male|volent intention, even <HI>to blind their minds, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 4.4.</NOTE> Nor will he ever re|lea&s;e the captive, till He who is &s;tronger than the &s;trong man armed, &s;hall appear to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him.</P>
<P>In thus repre&s;enting mankind, I am fully authorized by the oracles of God; at pre&s;ent it may &s;uffice to menti|on I&s;a. 61.1. where the the prophet de&s;cribes the office of Chri&s;t in the following manner; <HI>The &s;pirit of the Lord God is upon me, becau&s;e the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek&mdash;to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the OPENING OF THE PRISON to them who are bound.</HI> In the&s;e words &s;inners while in unbelief, are con&s;idered as <HI>bound in pri&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame per&s;ons <HI>are appointed to death.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To the death of the body. The original threat|ning was, <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die</HI>; which has been verified from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to this time, in the dreadful havoc which death has made, among the inhabitants of the world. <HI>The fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live forever?</HI> No, they have &s;een corruption; and &s;o mu&s;t we who now appear in this hou&s;e. That youth is not the only one among&s;t us, appointed to death. We are all to die; though not in the &s;ame ignominious way with him.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="013030_0011_0F8FB21E1BF7F150">But death &s;imply con&s;idered is of &s;mall con&s;e|quence: It is &s;in that gives death his &s;ting, and makes the guilty tremble, when he anticipates his appearance before God the Judge of all. For &s;uch are,</P>
<P N="2">2. Appointed to an <HI>eternal death,</HI> provided they &s;hould abide in a &s;tate of unbelief. For all who are under the law, are under the cur&s;e; and the cur&s;e of the law is nothing le&s;s, than an everla&s;ting bani&s;h|ment from the pre&s;ence of God, and a being &s;hut up forever with infernal &s;pirits!</P>
<P>No &s;ooner does the &s;inner become &s;en&s;ible, that he is in this condition, &s;hut up under the law, under the dominion of &s;in, led captive by &s;atan, and morally incapable of delivering him&s;elf; than he breathes out his &s;oul before God, with, <HI>Wo is to me, for I am undone&mdash;O Lord, &s;houlde&s;t thou be &s;trict to mark iniquity, who could &s;tand?</HI> This conviction of guilt will make the pri&s;oner groan; for a wounded &s;pirit who can bear? In this re&s;pect, the heart knoweth its own bitterne&s;s; bitterne&s;s it is emphatically, for any &s;inner to feel the law coming home to his con&s;cience, in its extent and &s;pirituality, by which is the know|ledge of &s;in; and at the &s;ame time have no ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of the atonement; or the one glorious, and efficacious &s;acrifice for &s;in, Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Di&s;tre&s;s like this he never knew before; nor could he form any proper idea of it: For now the commandment comes, &s;in revives, and he dies.</P>
<P>We have this conviction of &s;in exemplified, and the unea&s;ine&s;s of mind which re&s;ults from it, in the con|duct of the three thou&s;and, the jailor, &amp;c. Who no &s;ooner &s;aw what they were, than they cried out, <HI>What &s;hall we do?</HI> Which introduces the</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="14" REF="013030_0012_0F8FB21E5626FD70">IId. Thing propo&s;ed. To con&s;ider the truths which alone are calculated to comfort tho&s;e, who are in this &s;ituation. He <HI>looketh down from the height of his &s;anctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth: to hear the groning of the pri&s;oner, to loo&s;e tho&s;e who are appointed to death.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord is &s;aid to <HI>behold the earth. Earth</HI> here, by a figure, is put for its inhabitants, whom the Lord continually ob&s;erves. Though He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in|finite perfection, and would have been eternally hap|py in the enjoyment of Him&s;elf, if there had never been either angels or men; yet He conde&s;cends to be|hold human affairs. The creatures of his power, are, and ever will be the &s;ubjects of his laws. The&s;e laws men have broken, and by &s;o doing, have en|tirely cut them&s;elves off from any claim on God. Yet has He, moved &s;olely by his own unmerited love, and a <HI>&s;upreme</HI> regard to the di&s;play of his glo|ry, adju&s;ted a way of deliverance for the guilty, con|&s;i&s;tent with all the perfections of his nature. And in the fulne&s;s of time <HI>He &s;ent forth his Son, made of a woman.&mdash;God &s;o loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in Him, might not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 3.16.</NOTE> Here|in is the love of God manife&s;ted; and by this a&s;to|ni&s;hing act of grace, it is apparent that He beholds the earth.</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who was in the bo&s;om of the Father before time, upon his incarnation, proceeded with unremitting diligence to make an end of &s;in, and to bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. To accompli&s;h which he was made under the law, obeyed its pre|cepts,
<PB N="15" REF="013030_0013_0F8FB21EF0404F68">
and endured its penalty in the behalf of his people. <HI>He died, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that He might bring us to God.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 3.18.</NOTE> And now <HI>through Him, all who believe are ju&s;tified from all things, from which they could not be ju&s;tified by the law of</HI> Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>This is the only truth that can give relief to a per|&s;on under a full view of his guilt, and mi&s;ery: And by it all real believers are enabled to rejoice; ac|counting all things but lo&s;s, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord.</P>
<P>I might ob&s;erve that the Lord beholds the earth in a way of providence, <HI>to hear the groning of the pri&s;oner,</HI> &amp;c. Thus in the ca&s;e of <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> when his brethren had determined to take his life; the Lord interpo&s;ed, and delivered him from their cruel de|&s;igns. Thus it was in the deliverance of <HI>David</HI> from the repeated attempts of <HI>Saul</HI> to kill him.&mdash;Al&s;o in loo&s;ing <HI>Jeremiah</HI> when ca&s;t into a dirty dungeon, for his fidelity in delivering the Lord's me&s;&s;age:&mdash;And in the remarkable in&s;tance of <HI>Peter,</HI> to whom the doors and gates opened of their own accord. In the&s;e in&s;tances, and many others of a like nature, we have the text exemplified, that the <HI>Lord heareth the groning of the pri&s;oner, and loo&s;eth tho&s;e who are appointed to death.</HI> But I &s;hall rather endeavor to accommodate this part of the text, to what hath been already &s;aid, relative to a &s;inner, his being &s;hut up under the law, &s;in and &s;atan. Who, &s;en&s;ible of his condition, or fully convinced that he is ju&s;tly appoint|ed to eternal death, groans out his &s;oul before God.</P>
<P>The truth which only can relieve him, as ju&s;t &s;ug|ge&s;ted, is the compleatne&s;s of redemption in Chri&s;t,
<PB N="16" REF="013030_0014_0F8FB21FB611FAE0">

<P N="1">1. How doth the Lord loo&s;e tho&s;e who <HI>are ap|pointed to death?</HI> Sen&s;ible of their true condition, they &s;tand condemned before God, crying guilty, guilty. They have no recommending qualifications; no appendages to their characters which recommend them as objects of the divine favor.

<P>The que&s;tion &s;till returns, How is he delivered from this wretched condition? I an&s;wer, <HI>by the</HI> TRUTH BELIEVED. The in&s;pired writers, by way of empha&s;is, di&s;tingui&s;h the doctrine of atone|ment by this phra&s;e, <HI>the truth.</HI> Thus the author of the epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10.26.</NOTE> <HI>For if we &s;in wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of THE TRUTH, there remaineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;ins,</HI> &amp;c. i. e.

<P><PB N="17" REF="013030_0015_0F8FB220A228EF20">The word <HI>truth</HI> is often u&s;ed as a general term, including the whole go&s;pel of &s;alvation; or the com|pleat character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And whenever it is &s;poken of as connected with eternal life, it involves the propitiation of Chri&s;t, or his one compleat &s;acri|fice for &s;in.</P>
<P>As this <HI>truth</HI> is the ground of the &s;inner's hope, or cau&s;e of rejoicing; it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the <HI>truth</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>believed,</HI> or <HI>known,</HI> in order to pre&s;ent peace, and future happine&s;s.

<P>In a word then, the &s;inner is relieved from his pain|ful &s;en&s;e of guilt, by the truth which he is enabled to believe; by which he is fully convinced of the glory of the per&s;on of Je&s;us, and the fulne&s;s of grace in Him: And he now &s;ees that God is ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of them who believe in Chri&s;t; becau&s;e He hath brought in <HI>everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which is unto all, and upon all them who believe.</P>
<P>Here a very intere&s;ting enquiry ari&s;es; viz.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="18" REF="013030_0016_0F8FB2212EB65BD8">2. What follows a real belief of the truth as it is in Je&s;us; or the &s;inner's being loo&s;ed from his for|mer unhappy &s;tate?</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That plea&s;ing view which the per&s;on has when brought to believe, of the excellency of Je&s;us, and the infinite &s;ufficiency of his merits, is attended with the <HI>highe&s;t approbation</HI> of Him, and an <HI>imme|diate flight</HI> to Him. He appears to &s;uch a &s;oul, to be infinitely de&s;erving of &s;upreme affection, on ac|count of his e&s;&s;ential glory: Or as being the bright|ne&s;s of the Father's glory, and expre&s;s image of his per&s;on. To &s;uch an one, He is altogether lovely, and the chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;and.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the &s;inner has &s;uch an appre|hen&s;ion of his compleat redemption, that he <HI>flies</HI> to Him, and <HI>tru&s;ts</HI> his immortal all in his hands. How|ever his &s;ins may ri&s;e like mountains, or appear to reach to the clouds; he is made to know that <HI>where &s;in hath abounded, grace hath much more abounded.</HI> And that it is a faithful &s;aying, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world, to &s;ave the chief of &s;inners. On Him with all his guilt, he re&s;ts; fully per&s;uaded, that if God &s;hould be &s;trict to mark iniquity, he could not &s;tand: But that there is forgivene&s;s with Him, that He may be feared.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) He whom the Lord delivers from &s;piritual bondage, immediately upon believing, is &s;et <HI>at liber|ty from that load of guilt, which lay upon his con|&s;cience</HI>; and he pa&s;&s;es at once into a &s;tate <HI>of joy and peace.</HI> This event is not progre&s;&s;ive; or brought about gradually; but takes place at the very time, when the &s;oul believes in Je&s;us. For the truth of
<PB N="19" REF="013030_0017_0F8FB223ABB1D638">
this remark, I appeal to believers of every denomi|nation. When you were &s;et at liberty, my brethren, from the di&s;tre&s;s of a guilty con&s;cience, was it not by a di&s;covery made to your minds, by the holy Gho&s;t, of the con&s;i&s;tency, and &s;ufficiency of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t? Did not the belief of that truth, at once calm your minds, and lead you to rejoice in the only begotten Son of God? And have you not always found, in your life of faith, that your comfort only can &s;pring from <HI>looking to Je&s;us?</HI> By whom the law is magnified, and made honorable; and in whom all the heirs of promi&s;e are compleat.</P>
<P>This &s;entiment is abundantly taught us in the holy &s;criptures. Thus according to the words of Chri&s;t, which were mentioned before&mdash;<HI>You &s;hall know the truth, and the truth</HI> thus known, yea, and as &s;oon as it is known, <HI>&s;hall make you free.</HI> This &s;piritual freedom takes place in a degree at the in&s;tant that the &s;inner experimentally knows the truth. We read, That <HI>being ju&s;tified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 5.1.</NOTE> As the divine righteou&s;ne&s;s is the &s;ole matter and cau&s;e of ju&s;tification before God, I conclude that the apo&s;tle &s;peaks here of faith as ju&s;tifying, in <HI>no other &s;en&s;e,</HI> than as it apprehends the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and derives peace to the mind from it. Hence an emi|nent divine, &s;uppo&s;es that the <HI>comma</HI> in this text &s;hould be tran&s;po&s;ed thus; <HI>being ju&s;tified, by faith we have peace with God,</HI> &amp;c. In this reading, <HI>peace with God,</HI> is an effect of faith. But I mean not to in&s;i&s;t on this matter, &s;eeing the &s;criptures continu|ally a&s;&s;ure us, that <HI>peace of con&s;cience,</HI> &s;tands con|nected with the <HI>belief of the truth:</HI> And this &s;enti|ment
<PB N="20" REF="013030_0018_0F8FB224EAD84300">
is plainly taught us in the text above cited, let what will be the apo&s;tle's meaning in the &s;entence, <HI>ju&s;tified by faith.</HI></P>
<P>I might run over a number of pa&s;&s;ages, which confirm the above remark; &s;uch as <HI>joy and peace in believing:</HI> If in <HI>believing,</HI> the per&s;on mu&s;t rejoice on the <HI>&s;pot</HI> where God met with him; and the very <HI>minute</HI> that he believed the truth. The apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> repre&s;ents the matter thus&mdash;<HI>Whom having not &s;een, ye love; in whom, though now we &s;ee him not yet BE|LIEVING, YE REJOICE with joy un&s;peakable, and full of glory.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 1.8.</NOTE></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if this grand truth concerning the per&s;on and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, is not &s;ufficient to give peace to a con&s;cience wounded by a &s;en&s;e of &s;in; why did the apo&s;tles always propo&s;e it to &s;uch? As we find they invariably did.</P>
<P>Upon the whole; when any &s;inner is really bro't to believe in Je&s;us, he will have an experience of that peace which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding: For <HI>God who commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, &s;hines in his heart, to give him the light of the knowledge of his own glory in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 4.6.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">(3.) He who really believes in the Son of God, will have exten&s;ive views of the <HI>malignity of &s;in,</HI> and its oppo&s;ition to a God of infinite perfection; from which will ari&s;e <HI>ab&s;olute hatred</HI> of it, and <HI>unfeigned &s;orrow</HI> for it. No per&s;on can under&s;tand the <HI>exceed|ing &s;infulne&s;s</HI> of &s;in like the believer; nor &s;orrow for it, as he does. <HI>He looketh on Him whom he hath pierc|ed, and mourns, as one mourneth for an only &s;on, and is

in bitterne&s;s as one who is in bitterne&s;s for a fir&s;t-born.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zech. 12.10.</NOTE> The very &s;ecret corruptions of his heart, which are unnoticed but by God, and his own &s;oul, give him keen di&s;tre&s;s. He mourns his felt unlike|ne&s;s to the divine character; and many times cries out in the language of St. <HI>Paul, O wretched man that I am: who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 7.24.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">(4) Connected with which are his <HI>fervent long|ings</HI> after <HI>perfect &s;anctification.</HI> He who has obtain|ed this &s;piritual deliverance, is led to di&s;cover the real beauty of holine&s;s, as it is an e&s;&s;ential perfection of the deity; without which he feels that he mu&s;t be forever unhappy. That rectitude in which God fir&s;t created him, he lo&s;t by his connection with the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI>; and became vain in his imaginations; his evil heart being darkned. So long as he remains under the ruins of the apo&s;tacy, he mu&s;t be unlike to God, therefore mi&s;erable in him&s;elf, and unfit for heaven; <HI>into which nothing &s;hall enter that defileth, worketh abomination, or that maketh a lie.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 21.27.</NOTE> The man who believes in Je&s;us, knows this; and can ne|ver be contented while he is unholy.

<P N="5">(5.) <HI>Love to the children of God</HI> is another evi|dence of this &s;piritual deliverance, or of our faith in Je&s;us. <HI>For he who loveth Him who begat, loveth them al&s;o who are begotten of Him.</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 5.1.</NOTE> In another place the &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;peaks &s;till &s;tronger, <HI>We know

Or becau&s;e they appear to be the real di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who have drank into his &s;pirit, and are &s;tudious to be like Him in temper and conduct. It matters not whe|ther they be rich or poor, bond or free; if brethren in the Lord, the real believer will love them in their poverty, or meanne&s;s of outward condition, for Je&s;us &s;ake. And it has always been remarked, that love to the brethren has mo&s;t prevailed, when religion has flouri&s;hed mo&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) Every per&s;on who knows the truth as it is in Je&s;us, will be careful to <HI>maintain good works.</HI> True faith is influential, and leads him who has it, to &s;earch out the will of God, and to yield obedience to every known part of his duty. <HI>Faith,</HI> &s;ays <HI>James, with|out works is dead.</HI></P>
<P N="7">(7.) Another effect of this &s;piritual deliverance is, <HI>readine&s;s to di&s;tribute to the relief of the brethren,</HI> when in our power. This we &s;hall &s;urely be ready to do, if we love them for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and &s;ee that they are reduced to nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances; while we our&s;elves, have all, and abound; or at lea&s;t, have enough for our&s;elves, and &s;omething to &s;pare for a &s;uffering brother. <HI>For who&s;o hath this world's goods, and &s;eeth his brother have need, and &s;hutteth up his bowels of compa&s;&s;ion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. 3.17.</NOTE></P>

of God's dear Son, find the truth &s;ufficient to &s;up|port them under the heavie&s;t afflictions. They have, in many in&s;tances, overcome the world, and rejoiced in death.

<P N="1">1.

<P>But God hath wi&s;ely hidden the <HI>future</HI> from us, that we may rightly di&s;charge the duties of the <HI>pre|&s;ent,</HI> and leave what <HI>&s;hall be</HI> to the direction of un|erring wi&s;dom.</P>

May the greatne&s;s of her pre&s;ent trial, effectually &s;ecure her from all unkind reflections.</P>
<P>It is a matter of gratitude, that &s;uch awful events are hidden from us; if they were not, parents, in|&s;tead of rejoicing, would have rea&s;on to mourn and weep, on the birth of a child. But as the matter is now circum&s;tanced, they give a loo&s;e to their tender affections, which become apparent,</P>
<P N="2">2. By a <HI>prevailing anxiety</HI> for the welfare of their children; who make a great part of dome&s;tic happi|ne&s;s. If they are attacked by threatning &s;ickne&s;s, with what inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;olicitude do the parents watch every motion, and dread the con&s;equence; willing to bear a part of their affliction, was it po&s;&s;ible. With what concern do they attend them by day and by night; never ea&s;y to leave them, le&s;t any thing &s;hould be omitted, that might tend to give ea&s;e or relief. And when death hath appeared inevitable, how have they agonized in mind; and have been ready to cry out in the pa&s;&s;ionate, though unju&s;tifia|ble language of <HI>David, O Ab&s;alom my &s;on, my &s;on Ab&s;alom: Would God I</HI> might <HI>die for thee.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This affection is al&s;o di&s;covered by all that <HI>co&s;t</HI> and <HI>care</HI> with which they conduct them through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tages of life to manhood. It is with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure, that the indulgent parent, pro|vides
<PB N="33" REF="013030_0031_0F8FB230E3EA7D10">
for the &s;upport and education of his children; &s;paring neither pains nor expence, in order to ac|compli&s;h them for &s;ome u&s;eful &s;phere in life. Who thinks him&s;elf amply compen&s;ated, when they con|duct with propriety, at home and abroad.</P>
<P>Parents indeed, &s;hould always be upon their guard in this part of their conduct, le&s;t exce&s;&s;ive affection &s;hould lead them to too great indulgence, and to ex|ceed their ability in the manner of providing for them. The danger in this re&s;pect is certainly great.</P>
<P N="4">4. Children may al&s;o be convinced of the truth now before us, by adverting to the readine&s;s of their parents to pa&s;s by many improprieties of behavior; on which they put the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible con&s;truction, and cover all with a mantle of parental love; hoping, that with advancing years, they will &s;ee their follies, and do better. It is not one, nor two di&s;appoint|ments, that can cau&s;e a tender parent to deny his children a part in his affections, or help in di&s;tre&s;s. Though <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI>'s crime was greatly aggravated, the heart of <HI>David</HI> yearned towards him; and when <HI>Ahimaaz</HI> approached him with a me&s;&s;age from <HI>Joab,</HI> the fir&s;t que&s;tion the king a&s;ked was, <HI>Is the young man Ab&s;alom &s;afe?</HI> The &s;afety of a rebellious &s;on, was the principal concern of <HI>David</HI>'s heart.</P>
<P>Parental affection is &s;till the &s;ame. Hence, though a &s;on may act the part of the <HI>prodigal,</HI> leave his fa|ther's hou&s;e, and &s;pend his &s;ub&s;tance in riotous living; he &s;hall no &s;ooner appear &s;orry for his conduct, and ready to return; than the father, while he is yet a great way off, will run, and fall upon his neck, and ki&s;s him; &s;aying as he goes, <HI>This my &s;on was dead,
<PB N="34" REF="013030_0032_0F8FB230F575D250">
and is alive again; was lo&s;t and is found.</HI> Such, my young friends, is the nature of that love, which your parents have for you; and,</P>
<P N="5">5. Which leads them to watch the <HI>connections</HI> you form in life; and to approve, or di&s;approve, of them, as they apprehend them calculated to &s;erve, or injure you. It is an indi&s;putable maxim, that, "Evil com|munications corrupt good manners." Much de|pends, with re&s;pect to moral conduct, upon the com|pany which youth keep. It mu&s;t therefore be the parents duty, to guard them as much as po&s;&s;ible a|gain&s;t &s;uch at entertain <HI>bad &s;entiments,</HI> as well as <HI>bad practices</HI>; for there is a certain connection between the two. Actions ari&s;e from principles; and when the cau&s;e is bad, we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that the effect will be &s;o too. As the tree is, &s;uch will be the fruit; we never expect to <HI>gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;tles.</HI> Parents therefore, cannot be inat|tentive to the company which their children keep; but will &s;olemnly caution them again&s;t tho&s;e, who&s;e opinions and practices, are unrea&s;onable and wicked. And the warmer their affections are, the more abun|dantly will they u&s;e every method of per&s;ua&s;ion, to in&s;pire their children with a dete&s;tation of bad com|pany, the bane of multitudes.</P>
<P N="6">6. But I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s this part of the &s;ubject, which has re&s;pect to <HI>mere natural affection,</HI> by ob&s;erving, that it commonly runs parallel with life. Hence we &s;ee the parents, even when advanced in years, ri&s;ing up early, and &s;itting up late; and pur&s;uing their bu&s;ine&s;s with unremitting diligence, in order to ac|quire a &s;ufficient fortune, to di&s;tribute among their children at the clo&s;e of life: At which &s;olemn period
<PB N="35" REF="013030_0033_0F8FB231D59C1AC0">
this affection has generally appeared in the mo&s;t moving terms, in the la&s;t wi&s;hes, and affectionate farewel of the tender parent.</P>
<P N="7">7. Under this head, I have only to add, That tho&s;e parents who know the truth as it is in Je&s;us, while they art duly concerned for the <HI>temporal intere&s;t</HI> of their children, are <HI>&s;upremely</HI> anxious about their <HI>everla&s;ting &s;alvation.</HI> This we cannot expect of tho&s;e who have never ta&s;ted that the Lord is graci|ous. But &s;uch as have been made &s;en&s;ible of their own danger out of Chri&s;t, and have been enabled to fly for refuge to the hope &s;et before them, cannot be &s;atisfied, tho' their children enjoy wealth and honor; if at the &s;ame time they have rea&s;on to believe, that they are in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and bonds of ini|quity. Remaining thus, they know that they mu&s;t be mi&s;erable forever. A thought like this, pierces the believing parent to the heart; and animates him in the di&s;charge of his duty to his children: Whom he labors to in&s;truct in the great things which belong to their peace. And is always careful to accompany his in&s;tructions, with &s;olemn prayer to God, that they may be &s;aved in the day of the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>From all that has been &s;aid, we &s;ee that in con&s;e|quence of the&s;e &s;trong affections, parents, in a pecu|liar &s;en&s;e, become intere&s;ted in all the conduct and circum&s;tances of their children. We &s;hall therefore readily admit, that <HI>a fooli&s;h &s;on is a grief to his fa|ther, and bitterne&s;s to her who bare him.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The character of a <HI>fooli&s;h &s;on</HI> is now to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="013030_0034_0F8FB2327015BCF8">By whom we are not to under&s;tand an <HI>idiot</HI>; or one who is de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e.

Such per&s;ons ju&s;tly merit the character of <HI>fooli&s;h &s;ons,</HI> and are evidently de&s;igned by the wi&s;e man.</P>
<P>Any one who will take time to examine his wri|tings, will find that he frequently u&s;es the words <HI>fools,</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> in the above &s;en&s;e; that is, as de&s;criptive of a wicked man; who de&s;pi&s;es God and religion, and gives a loo&s;e to his vicious pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>Fools,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>make a mock at &s;in:</HI> Nor can the wicked di&s;cover more flagrant folly, than by making a mock at that, which will one day find them out to their eternal confu&s;ion.

<P><PB N="37" REF="013030_0035_0F8FB23333FEF578">In order, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring the matter home to con&s;cience, I &s;hall mention particular in&s;tances of the conduct of a <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> &s;on; and point out his egregious folly therein.</P>
<P N="1">1. The character mo&s;t &s;urely belongs to him, who rejects <HI>parental in&s;truction,</HI> and <HI>admonition.</HI> Chil|dren, while young, are more ea&s;ily brought to &s;ub|mit to family-government, and to li&s;ten to the in|&s;tructions of parents, than after they are farther ad|vanced in years: Con&s;equently in common occa&s;ion much le&s;s grief, and anxiety to their parents at that period of life, than when they begin to extend their acquaintance, by forming new connections; and to put on the character of men, and women: Which many do too &s;oon; or before they have wi&s;dom and prudence to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>At this time of life, they are in the utmo&s;t danger of being captivated by their giddy, thoughtle&s;s com|panions; who flutter, full of life, from thing to thing, in pur&s;uit of various &s;cenes of di&s;&s;ipation. A youth who finds his a&s;&s;ociates left to their own di&s;cretion, will feel unea&s;y under re&s;traint, and with reluctance li&s;ten to the advice of parents. For &s;uch an opinion has he of his own under&s;tanding, that he believes him&s;elf the be&s;t judge of his own conduct, and that he is &s;ufficiently qualified to govern him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His parents he firmly believes are too rigid in their di&s;cipline, and too &s;crupulou&s;ly nice about the mode of conduct. That a greater latitude of behavior can do him no harm; and that he may indulge him&s;elf as his companions do, without hazard.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="013030_0036_0F8FB233F7A1A360">No &s;ooner does he adopt the above &s;entiments, than he will treat his parents with a degree of neglect. The delicacy of his natural di&s;po&s;ition, the fear of incurring their di&s;plea&s;ure, and thereby &s;u&s;taining a lo&s;s by his father's la&s;t will; or a &s;en&s;e of his obliga|tion to his parents, ari&s;ing from their indulgence; may prevent his behaving rude to their face. But at the &s;ame time he determines to allow him&s;elf grea|ter liberties than they incline to give him. And the parents mu&s;t be, either very incon&s;iderate, or void of di&s;cernment, not to fore&s;ee the fatal tendency of &s;uch behavior; unle&s;s the Lord prevent it. For though his connections may be of the <HI>politer</HI> &s;ort, and his gratifications, <HI>fa&s;hionable</HI>; his folly is no le&s;s evident, and his de&s;truction no le&s;s certain.</P>
<P>There are others who are ruder in their behavior, and more open and affrontive in their di&s;obedience to their parents; who treat them with unkindne&s;s to their faces, and re&s;olutely determine to gratify their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In &s;uch ca&s;es, the parents are made to endure many hours of dejection. They &s;it together, and mutually bewail their <HI>fooli&s;h &s;on</HI>; and in the <HI>bitterne&s;s</HI> of their &s;ouls, are almo&s;t ready to wi&s;h, that he had never been born.</P>
<P>Could the di&s;obedient to parents know the heart rending expre&s;&s;ions, which his conduct occa&s;ions; or the many &s;olitary hours, which the afflicted pa|rents pa&s;s together on his account; his heart mu&s;t be like adamant not to relent.</P>
<P>The <HI>folly</HI> of &s;uch a conduct mu&s;t become obvious to all, who duly con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="39" REF="013030_0037_0F8FB23582607988">(1.) That the parents have trod the path of life, and by experience, have learned the dangers to which their children are expo&s;ed: Con&s;equently, like the &s;kilful pilot, are qualified to direct them. That mar|riner mu&s;t be deemed a mad man, or at lea&s;t very ra&s;h and imprudent, who arriving on a dangerous coa&s;t, with which he is unacquainted, &s;hould refu&s;e the directions of one who knows every place of danger. Greater is the folly of tho&s;e, who, though young, and inexperienced, ru&s;h on in their own way, regardle&s;s of the advice of parents.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Nor is their folly le&s;s apparent in thus reject|ing parental in&s;truction, when we con&s;ider, that the parents are not only qualified by experience to guard them again&s;t the hazards of the pre&s;ent life; but that all their in&s;tructions ari&s;e from the <HI>warme&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;incere affection:</HI> Which has been largely treated of in a former part of this di&s;cour&s;e.

<P N="3">(3.) They al&s;o pour contempt on the &s;olemn di|rections of God Him&s;elf; who in both the old, and new te&s;tament, has taught the duty of filial obedi|ence. <HI>Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. 6.1.</NOTE> The &s;ame exhortation is repeated el&s;e|where in the in&s;pired writings.

<P N="4"><PB N="40" REF="013030_0038_0F8FB23661C63998">(4.) The folly of &s;uch mu&s;t be farther evident, while we con&s;ider the ruinous <HI>tendency</HI> of this vice. It mu&s;t be taken for granted, from that near, and a|greable connection which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the parent and the child, that he will wholly con&s;ult his benefit; advi&s;e him to nothing that &s;hall di&s;&s;erve his reputati|on or intere&s;t, nor lay him under any unnece&s;&s;ary re|&s;traints. If therefore, the child rejects the parent's in&s;tructions, it mu&s;t be that he may indulge him&s;elf in things forbidden and injurious. In con&s;equence of which, he lays him&s;elf open to numberle&s;s tempta|tions; and there is every rea&s;on to fear his ruin. For when nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint is removed, he will be likely to be hurried by the impetuo&s;ity of his pa&s;&s;ions into every extreme. Many times did I hear the late <HI>unhappy youth</HI> declare, that had he "regarded the ad|vice of a tender mother, he &s;hould not have come to &s;uch an awful end." Nor was he the fir&s;t, who re|flected on him&s;elf for his <HI>di&s;obedience</HI> to parents.</P>

<P>The cau&s;e of <HI>infidelity</HI> has many friends; &s;ome of whom are to be found among per&s;ons of different a|ges, and characters. Their number probably is much greater than it appears to be. For every dei&s;t is not willing to be known; he fears a di&s;covery le&s;t he &s;hould &s;uffer in intere&s;t or reputation. But when he has a proper opportunity, he throws off his di&s;gui&s;e, and can lampoon revealed religion as fa&s;t as any of the company. "And wherever &s;uch men fall in with the youth of pregnant &s;pirits, and more liberal education; they bend all their arts to corrupt

<P N="1">(1.) What folly mu&s;t it be to reject <HI>chri&s;tianity,</HI> without a <HI>better religion</HI> in its &s;tead: And who would not reject it, could a <HI>better</HI> be found? I mean a reli|gion more <HI>honorary</HI> to God, and <HI>&s;afe</HI> for man? But amid&s;t all tho&s;e who have oppo&s;ed chri&s;tianity, and have been <HI>nibbling</HI> at that glorious &s;y&s;tem of divine truth, where is the man who has paved the way for the rejection of it, by &s;ub&s;tituting a <HI>better</HI> in its place?</P>
<P>The chri&s;tians are now made to bear the imputa|tion of <HI>weakne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>wickedne&s;s,</HI> for their attachment to the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: But &s;hould they ca&s;hier it, without a better in its &s;tead, they might <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> be looked upon as <HI>con&s;ummate fools.</HI></P>
<P>Great &s;welling words have been u&s;ed by <HI>free think|ers,</HI> concerning the <HI>religion of nature</HI>; and the <HI>light of rea&s;on</HI> as a <HI>&s;ufficient guide</HI> to duty and happine&s;s. To judge rightly of which, I know of no more rea&s;ona|ble, and conci&s;e method, than to con&s;ult the &s;tate of the <HI>heathen</HI> world. By &s;uch conduct, we are &s;oon made acquainted with the true &s;tate of human nature, un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted by revelation. The <HI>Greeks,</HI> with all their learning, had lords many, and gods many; and wor|&s;hipped for gods the work of mens hands. They had a religion, but it was filled with idolatry, and
<PB N="42" REF="013030_0040_0F8FB237B61882C0">
various practices, which evidently proved, that the light of nature in fallen man, is by no means a &s;uffi|cient guide to duty and happine&s;s. And I cannot but think, that the more we look into the condition of the different <HI>heathen</HI> nations, the more fully will the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of a divine revelation appear.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) What <HI>folly</HI> mu&s;t tho&s;e men be guilty of, who reject chri&s;tianity, without being able to <HI>di&s;prove</HI> a &s;ingle truth or fact?</P>
<P>"Do they not daily hear from the holy &s;criptures, and the doctrines of chri&s;tianity, of an eternity, either of happine&s;s and &s;olacing joys, or of mi&s;ery or tor|ments; which is to begin when this frail life doth end? Now can the&s;e men of jollity, give any demon|&s;trative evidence, that in the event they &s;hall not really find it &s;o? Can they prove from their prin|ciples of &s;elf-evidence, that the&s;e are only amu&s;ing whims, melancholy dreams, or &s;carecrows and bug|bears, to frighten them from their &s;inful plea&s;ures, and di&s;turb their carnal repo&s;e? No; though they are daring enough, yet they have not the confidence to pretend to this.</P>
<P>"And ought not this to awaken that rea&s;on where|with men are endowed, at lea&s;t to ponder deliber|ately the weighty arguments of moral evidence, for the truth of chri&s;tianity, with all the impartiality they can? If there is an hereafter, in which all mu&s;t be &s;harers eternally; either of the greate&s;t felicity, or the mo&s;t dreadful mi&s;ery? If this is confidently af|firmed, on the one hand, by wi&s;e and good men, who profe&s;s a full conviction of it; and on the other hand, there is no pretended evidence that it is not, or cannot

<P>To <HI>deny</HI> the truth of chri&s;tianity, without <HI>proving</HI> it to be fal&s;e, &s;urely is not all that we are to expect from a &s;ett of men, who mean to be thought, the mo&s;t <HI>profound rea&s;oners.</HI></P>
<P>Can the&s;e men really <HI>prove</HI> that there never was &s;uch a per&s;on as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who made his appear|ance near eighteen hundred years &s;ince? Or, that <HI>Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, Peter,</HI> &amp;c. were fictitious.&mdash;Or, that the <HI>former</HI> was not crucified on mount <HI>Calvary</HI>; and that the <HI>latter</HI> never were his di&s;ciples? Or if they admit, that &s;uch per&s;ons might have been, can they prove that they were a band of <HI>deceivers?</HI> And that the writings which bear their re&s;pective names, are fallacious?</P>
<P>Till this is done it mu&s;t be the highe&s;t <HI>folly</HI> to re|ject Chri&s;t and his religion;&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">(3.) E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that he who lets go chri&s;tianity, is in danger of falling into ab&s;olute <HI>&s;ceptici&s;m</HI>; or of doubting about every thing, that does not come within his own notice. For in reject|ing the religion of Chri&s;t, we reduce our creed to ve|ry few articles. If we di&s;believe the truth of chri&s;ti|anity, we deny that there ever were &s;uch per&s;ons as Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; that there are either good or evil angels; heaven or hell, the re&s;urrection of the dead, and a day of judgment. And many have doubted of the immortality of the &s;oul; which, if they have been unwilling to let go entirely, they have
<PB N="44" REF="013030_0042_0F8FB2392F0260C8">
however, found their minds at a lo&s;s to conceive of it, or to give credit to it. And &s;hould &s;uch per&s;ons proceed &s;o far in their infidelity, as to doubt whether there is a God, it would not be &s;urprizing. We are told that Dr. <HI>Tindal,</HI> died with this awful &s;entence in his mouth, <HI>If there is a God, I hope He will have mercy on me.</HI>&mdash;A doubt this, unworthy of a <HI>heathen.</HI> What happened to him, may happen to other infi|dels; for he who lets go chri&s;tianity, &s;inks at once into a horrid aby&s;s; and finds him&s;elf enveloped in clouds and darkne&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) I &s;hall only add here, that it mu&s;t be the high|e&s;t <HI>folly</HI> in any per&s;on, to reject chri&s;tianity, &s;eeing it furni&s;hes us with the be&s;t rules for <HI>moral conduct,</HI> ad|mini&s;ters <HI>&s;ufficient &s;upports</HI> under the <HI>heavie&s;t afflicti|ons</HI> of the pre&s;ent life, and in the important <HI>hour of death.</HI></P>
<P>The practical principles of revealed religion are ma|ny; it may &s;uffice to mention the following, viz. <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and mind, and &s;oul, and &s;trength; and thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> Supreme love to God, and a due regard to our neighbour, will always have an important influ|ence on our practice; by leading us to &s;eek to plea&s;e the former, and to relieve the latter. Our duty in the la&s;t re&s;pect, is taught in the mo&s;t &s;triking manner, by the account Chri&s;t has given us of a good <HI>Sama|ritan,</HI> who met with a certain man, on his way from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Jericho,</HI> who had fallen among thieves; by whom he had been treated in the mo&s;t cruel man|ner, and left half dead. The <HI>Samaritan</HI> no &s;ooner came where he was, than his humane heart glowed with compa&s;&s;ion; and he lent him every help in his
<PB N="45" REF="013030_0043_0F8FB23B87B7FF78">
power. Upon which Chri&s;t thus addre&s;&s;ed the per|&s;on, who&s;e enquiry occa&s;ioned the repetition of this &s;acred &s;tory,&mdash;<HI>Go thou, and do likewi&s;e.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 10.</NOTE> Thus, while the adorable Redeemer &s;everely cen&s;ures the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>Levite,</HI> from whom a kinder conduct might have been expected, He highly commends the friend|ly behavior of the <HI>Samaritan,</HI> and recommends him as worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o a conci&s;e, but compleat &s;y&s;tem of ethics in the following &s;hort pa&s;&s;age; <HI>As ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye to them likewi&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 6.31.</NOTE> We are farther taught <HI>to do ju&s;tly, love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Micah 6.8.</NOTE> <HI>To do good to all men</HI>&mdash;to &s;hun every vice, and to practice every virtue&mdash;to feed the hungry, to cloath the naked&mdash;to obey civil rulers, when they are the mini&s;ters of God for good. In a word, &s;uch are the rules laid down in the holy &s;crip|tures for the government of life, that they will, when duly ob&s;erved, lead us to the mo&s;t refined morality. I mu&s;t therefore ob&s;erve, in the words of another, That the chri&s;tian religion is of the utmo&s;t impor|tance to all orders and degrees of men; and that the greate&s;t &s;ervice that the mo&s;t zealous patriot can do his country, is to promote the faith, and thereby en|courage the practice of the truly divine virtues, re|commended by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Of no le&s;s importance is revealed religion to believ|ers in times of <HI>great afflictions.</HI> The &s;upports which ari&s;e from it to &s;uch, are matters of per&s;onal expe|rience; and therefore are a kind of <HI>internal</HI> evidence in its favor. Yet it may be ob&s;erved, that the fol|lowing truths which are addre&s;&s;ed to our under&s;tand|ings,
<PB N="46" REF="013030_0044_0F8FB23C6A875C10">
are calculated to give &s;uch &s;upports as have been mentioned, viz. That God, by a general and particu|lar providence, governs the world&mdash;that no events are ca&s;ual&mdash;but that all things are directed by infinite wi&s;dom, and &s;hall terminate in the glory of God, and the be&s;t intere&s;ts of his people: That all things <HI>now</HI> work together for good to them who love God&mdash;that our light afflictions which are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding, &amp; eternal weight of glory, &amp;c. If the&s;e truths are really believed, they tend in their own nature to &s;upport the afflicted, and to re|concile them to the whole of the divine conduct.</P>
<P>Nor do the truths of chri&s;tianity de&s;ert the believer in the important <HI>hour of death</HI>; but in many in&s;tan|ces, have enabled &s;uch to exult in their expiring mo|ments. Here I might call in a cloud of witne&s;&s;es; and in particular the noble army of martyrs ri&s;e into view, to te&s;tify the truth of the above remark. They reckoned that the &s;ufferings of the pre&s;ent life, were not worthy to be compared with the glory which, they believed, would be revealed in them. Nor did they count their lives dear unto them, that they might fini&s;h their cour&s;e with joy, and lay hold on eternal life; knowing that they had in heaven an en|during &s;ub&s;tance. The firm per&s;ua&s;ion that their &s;ouls &s;hould pa&s;s immediately to glory upon their &s;e|paration from the body; and that the body &s;hould ri&s;e again in the re&s;urrection at the la&s;t day, led them to triumph over the la&s;t enemy, &s;aying, <HI>O death, where is thy &s;ting!

injurious to &s;ociety, by removing tho&s;e re&s;traints which are nece&s;&s;arily laid on the vicious pa&s;&s;ions of men.

They with us, are candidates for immortality. Hence while we con&s;ult their pre&s;ent happine&s;s, we &s;hould be &s;upreme|ly

And tho&s;e of us who know what real religion is, will certainly be &s;upremely de&s;irous, that they may be &s;aved.

<P>It it probable that the preceding remarks fla&s;h guilty conviction, in the faces of unbelieving parents; who may now be ready to &s;ay.

<P>The &s;alvation of our own &s;ouls, or of the &s;ouls of our children, has been but &s;eldom thought of. Why &s;o, ye heads of families?

parents, your conduct ari&s;es <HI>from,</HI> and is an evidence <HI>of</HI> that depravity of heart, which many of you are unwilling to admit. Nor need we be at any lo&s;s to prove the total corruption of the human mind, while we attend to the conduct of men. By their fruit you may know them. For he who pours con|tempt on Chri&s;t and his religion, or treats them with indifference, is mo&s;t certainly an enemy in his mind by wicked works to God. Glad &s;hall I be, &s;hould the &s;pirit of truth, fa&s;ten a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of your real con|dition on your minds; and take of the things of Je|&s;us, and &s;hew them unto you.

<P N="2">2. Tho&s;e parents, who&s;e children behave with du|ty and affection towards them, and who are in many re&s;pects their comfort, will permit me to congratu|late them on &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing. If a <HI>fooli&s;h &s;on is a grief to his father, and bitterne&s;s to her who bare him</HI>; how great a plea&s;ure mu&s;t re&s;ult from children of an oppo&s;ite character. Such youth there are, who en|tertain the tendere&s;t regards for their parents; feel for them in every difficulty, and yield the mo&s;t chear|ful obedience to every ju&s;t command. Who care|fully &s;tudy their parents ea&s;e and intere&s;t; and &s;hun tho&s;e things, which they apprehend will occa&s;ion grief. How commendable is the conduct of &s;uch; and how happy the parents who are in &s;uch a ca&s;e. But what an un&s;peakable addition mu&s;t it be to the godly parents happine&s;s, to have rea&s;on to think that their children are really acquainted with Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
<PB N="55" REF="013030_0053_0F8FB244999FD850">
and his divine religion. This is a ble&s;&s;ing inexpre&s;&s;i|bly great; and when rightly viewed, fills the parents hearts with humility and gratitude. Now no fears of a future, endle&s;s &s;eparation rack their minds; but they dwell together as in the fear of God, and rejoice in hope of eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Knit by the ties of nature and religion, they become <HI>one,</HI> in a mo&s;t inti|mate &s;en&s;e; and mutually contribute to each others felicity. Happy parents, and happy children, when both can rejoice in God their Savior.</P>
<P>Alas, &s;ays &s;ome aged father, or almo&s;t broken heart|ed mother; this is not my ca&s;e. Mine is a <HI>fooli&s;h &s;on,</HI> and has been a grief to me all my days.

<P N="5">5. It may be that &s;ome &s;uch prodigal is here to day.

Would to God, that his awful end might prove a u&s;eful warning to the &s;ons of vice!&mdash;He &s;eldom thought, while pur&s;u|ing his ba&s;e conduct, what would be the i&s;&s;ue; and when he did, the devil and his lu&s;ts prevailed again&s;t every remon&s;trance of con&s;cience.

<P N="4">4. Such awful in&s;tances, among other important con&s;iderations, may tend to calm the minds of pa|rents, and check their immoderate &s;orrow, when the Lord is plea&s;ed to take away their children in infancy.

They might have act|ed the part of fooli&s;h children, and have brought their parents to the grave in &s;orrow. If the Lord has &s;een it be&s;t to remove them, we may be &s;atisfied, that his way is perfect; and that all his conduct is or|dered by infinite wi&s;dom.

<P>Here I &s;hould have fini&s;hed the di&s;cour&s;e; but having been warmly &s;olicited by a number of my friends, after the execution of the <HI>unhappy youth,</HI> to &s;atisfy them and others re&s;pecting the &s;tate of the pri&s;oner's mind, as it appeared to me, during his confinement; and to give them &s;ome account of the conver&s;ation which we had together, as we walk|ed from the pri&s;on to the gallows; I con&s;ented to add the following Account of the matter; in

which, as far as I can tru&s;t my memory, I have truly repre&s;ented it, and made u&s;e of the pri&s;oner's own expre&s;&s;ions; which I have di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ingle <HI>commas.</HI></P>
<P>After his condemnation, there was a remarkable concern for him on the minds of many of the children of God, both mini&s;ters and private chri&s;tians; who &s;eemed to be favored with an uncommon &s;pirit of prayer for his &s;alvation. Many &s;upplications a&s;cend|ed to the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t from day to day for <HI>poor Ames,</HI> that he might be a monument of &s;overeign mercy, and die in faith. Nor was this the only way in which they di&s;covered their real regards for him: He was vi&s;ited by my fathers and brethren in the mini&s;try, of both town and country; and by many private chri&s;tians of different denominations. Kindne&s;&s;es were &s;hewn him from various quarters; nor was he in&s;en&s;ible of the obliga|tions he was under to his benefactors.</P>
<P>Having received a me&s;&s;age from him, acquainting me that he de&s;ired a vi&s;it; I went to &s;ee him; and found him &s;eemingly &s;tupid, with but&punc; little to &s;ay. Nor did he appear to me to be &s;o much affected with his condition as a <HI>condemned malefactor,</HI> as one would rea&s;onably have expected. This was the &s;tate of his mind the fir&s;t vi&s;its I made him. I endeavored to lay before him in as plain a manner as po&s;&s;ible, the nature of the divine law, under which he was as a man; and to the cur&s;e of which he &s;tood mo&s;t ju&s;tly expo&s;ed for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: Knowing, that <HI>by the law is the knowledge of &s;in.</HI> He owned that he was a great &s;inner, and de&s;erved to be ca&s;t off; but did not appear to have any proper views of his &s;inful na|ture and life.&mdash;Some days after, his con&s;cience &s;eemed to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure alarmed; and he di&s;covered
<PB N="58" REF="013030_0056_0F94FB94957B15A0">
unu&s;ual unea&s;ine&s;s. And a&s;&s;ured me,
<Q>that he did not know what to do. I have lived &s;uch a life, that I can have no hope from that, that God will have mercy on me. And my time is &s;o &s;hort, that I can do no good works to go to heaven by.</Q>
Thus he was perplexed; not knowing by what method God could &s;ave him. An attempt was made to open the nature of the go&s;pel to him; or the way of &s;alvation through the compleat redemption of Chri&s;t: And he was directed to the holy &s;criptures, as containing the whole will of God, re&s;pecting both the ruin and recovery; the law and go&s;pel.&mdash;But omitting much that pa&s;&s;ed, I would ob&s;erve, that at a certain time I found him in keen di&s;tre&s;s from a &s;en&s;e of his &s;inful condition; when he declared that he &s;aw him|&s;elf, yes, &s;aid he,
<Q>I <HI>feel</HI> that I am lo&s;t! I &s;ometimes think that I am given over to de&s;truction, and that there is no mercy for me. I am undone in &s;oul and body. If I go to the place of execution as I am now, they mu&s;t drag me like a bullock to the &s;laugh|ter. Oh, mu&s;t I die &s;o! I am like a man that made a great fire, and then run right into it! So I have done, I have run from God, and mu&s;t be damned, if God won't have mercy on me! May I not have a little longer time than is now fixed?</Q>
At this time he appeared to have very clear views of the ju&s;tice of God in condemning him, &s;hould that be the ca&s;e.
<Q>I &s;ee,</Q>
&s;aid he,
<Q>that if God could damn me a thou&s;and times, He would be ju&s;t&mdash;I never did any thing but &s;in again&s;t Him.</Q>
Thus I left him, confident that neither men or angels could help him; and that God would have mercy on whom He would have mercy.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of mind he continued until <HI>Fri|day Evening</HI> the 8th of <HI>October</HI>; when, according to his own account of the matter, he was unexpectedly reliev|ed,
<PB N="59" REF="013030_0057_0F94FB955CE47430">
in good mea&s;ure, from his guilty fears, by <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.26, 27. <HI>A new heart will I give you, and a new &s;pirit will I put within you and I will take away the &s;tony heart out of your fle&s;h, and I will give you an heart of fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. Upon hearing that the pri&s;oner appeared ea&s;y in his mind, I called to &s;ee him; being de&s;irous to know what was the occa&s;ion of it; and not without fears, le&s;t he &s;hould compa&s;s him&s;elf with &s;parks of his own kindling. Upon conver&s;ing with him, he &s;aid,
<Q>I feel my mind peaceable; &s;uch a peace as I never knew any thing of in my life before. I was turning over a little book which was put into my hands, and ca&s;t my eye on the&s;e words, <HI>A new heart will I give you,</HI> &amp;c. It &s;truck me&mdash;it came as if it was a promi&s;e to me. I wanted this <HI>new heart:</HI> For my heart was bad, bad indeed. This was God's promi&s;e. I knew that God could not lie; and therefore if I would not believe this, I would believe nothing. I was now &s;ure that God could give me a new heart&mdash;Oh, that is what I mo&s;t wanted. And I could not get it, but God hath let me &s;ee that He gives it.</Q>
He &s;aid &s;everal things about the grace of God in <HI>giving</HI> a new heart, a right &s;pirit, &amp;c. and particularly di&s;covered the view he had of the enmity of his own heart again&s;t God, in the following &s;en|tence,
<Q>I now &s;ee that I have &s;inned again&s;t God all my life, with as much <HI>envy</HI> as ever I killed a &s;nake; which I always had the greate&s;t hatred to.</Q>
He at this time &s;poke of his former contempt of the go&s;pel with evident &s;orrow; and expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude to all tho&s;e, who had vi&s;ited him, with a view of mak|ing him acquainted with the way of &s;alvation through Chri&s;t. 'This,' &s;aid he,
<Q>I never knew any thing of before, though I have always lived in this land where the go&s;pel is.</Q>
&mdash;From the time mentioned above, till
<PB N="60" REF="013030_0058_0F94FB97C4A76418">
his death, he had much to &s;ay about the words of the apo&s;tle <HI>John, The blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;eth from all &s;in.</HI> This &s;eemed to dwell in his mind; and on this truth, he a&s;&s;ured me, he re&s;ted all his hopes, or his &s;oul, guilty as it was.</P>
<P>The <HI>Saturday</HI> morning before his death, I was with him: When he was brought into the room, I ob|&s;erved that his countenance appeared &s;erene; rather plea&s;ant. I a&s;ked him how he did as to the &s;tate of his mind: His an&s;wer was, as near as I can recollect&mdash;
<Q>Comfortable; I want to be with Chri&s;t: He is glo|rious, and I am &s;inful.</Q></P>
<P>The Afternoon before his execution, I found him much terrified with the pro&s;pect of the <HI>manner</HI> of his death: He trembled and thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf;
<Q>I think I &s;ee my&s;elf hanging up before the people.</Q>
But this fear &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided; and at his own de&s;ire, he had three chri&s;tian friends to &s;pend the night with him; by whom I have been informed of his behavior thro' the night; and the manner in which they employed their time.</P>
<P>When they went into his room, he had the bible in his hand; and being a&s;ked how he was, he &s;aid, 'I am ea&s;y,' and began to read the 3d chap of <HI>John</HI>; and when he came to the words of Chri&s;t concerning the <HI>new birth,</HI> he &s;topped, and te&s;tified that he had rea&s;on to think, that God had given him to know by ex|perience what that was. Said &s;everal things re&s;pecting his view of the excellency of God, and the evil of &s;in; and thought as far as he knew his heart, that he did love God for his own worthine&s;s; and hate &s;in be|cau&s;e contrary to God. And a&s;&s;ured the company that he hated his own evil thoughts, and wanted to be freed from all &s;in. Crying out at times,
<Q>If I am not right, I hope God will put me right.</Q>
<Q>I &s;ee, &s;aid

he, that if I could be admitted into heaven with this body of &s;in, I could not be happy, I know I mu&s;t be like God; I mu&s;t be holy.</Q>
&mdash;He &s;lept none all night, and at times u&s;ed the following expre&s;&s;ions&mdash;
<Q>O what &s;hould I do, if it was not for Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;won|derful, wonderful goodne&s;s and love of God! How have we &s;inned again&s;t Him!</Q>
The company pray|ed with him alternately; and he, at their de&s;ire, pray|ed al&s;o: In his addre&s;s to God, he appeared &s;en&s;ible of his un&s;peakable guilt, and affected with the won|derful way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t: And earne&s;tly beg|ged that the Lord would be with him in his la&s;t hours: Nor did he forget to pray for his friends, and his enemies. In the morning he declared that he had a plea&s;ant night, appeared re&s;igned, and bid his friends farewel with calmne&s;s, never expecting to &s;ee them on earth again.</P>
<P>At 9 o'clock that morning (which was the day of his execution) at his reque&s;t, I vi&s;ited him. Found him &s;olemn and compo&s;ed, con&s;idering the circum|&s;tances in which he was; and had much conver&s;ation with him, in the pre&s;ence of four or five per&s;ons of &s;e|rious character. His views of him&s;elf, and of redemp|tion by Chri&s;t, were the &s;ame as he mentioned be|fore; therefore it is needle&s;s to repeat them. At this time, he more than once &s;aid,
<Q>I hope I am right, and &s;hall not deceive my&s;elf: On Chri&s;t alone I re&s;t; If I peri&s;h, I will peri&s;h at his feet.</Q></P>
<P>But I come now to the conver&s;ation that I had with him, as we walked in &s;olemn pace to the place of death.</P>
<P>About 2 o'clock he came out of the pri&s;on yard, attended with all the awful formalities of execution; his arms pinioned, and the halter about his neck, fol|lowing the cart in which were his coffin and the ladder. Gladly would I have been excu&s;ed from this painful

office; but the <HI>youth</HI>'s importunity, and a &s;en&s;e of duty, forbid me to decline it. I therefore &s;tepped up to him, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him, <HI>Ames,</HI> how do you feel under your pre&s;ent circum&s;tances? The an&s;wer was not a little &s;urprizing.&mdash;
<Q>I feel compo&s;ed.&mdash;I I am not afraid&mdash;what can make me feel &s;o; could it be if I had not a good hope?</Q>
This naturally led me to enter upon a familiar con&s;ideration of the nature of a <HI>good hope.</HI> Such as that hope is the expectation of enjoying a certain good at a future period&mdash;that a <HI>good hope</HI> of eternal life, or happine&s;s hereafter is a gift of God&mdash;that it has for its foundation, the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t&mdash;that the man who has a good hope has been made &s;en&s;ible of his guilt and helple&s;sne&s;s; and from a view of Chri&s;t as the ground of his hope, has been enabled to fly to Him, and ca&s;t him&s;elf up|on Him, expecting the ble&s;&s;ing hoped for wholly as a free gift; he being unworthy, and having nothing to bring as a price in his hand.&mdash;Farther, that where this divine hope is, there will be &s;uch gracious exer|ci&s;es of mind as the&s;e,&mdash;Hatred of &s;in, &s;in of heart and life, becau&s;e of its oppo&s;ition to God&mdash;a prevailing de&s;ire to be perfectly free from all &s;in, and like to God. With much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, &amp;c. He li&s;tened with a &s;olemn attention; and when I had done, he '&s;aid&mdash;
<Q>I know that there is no other &s;alvation, but Chri&s;t; on Him I re&s;t my &s;oul; and think I can &s;ay, I hate &s;in becau&s;e God hates it; and do long to be made holy&mdash;I &s;ee that if I had &s;inned but once; and could live a thou&s;and years, and pray and read all that time, I could not make amends for that one &s;in&mdash;I can have no hope but Chri&s;t&mdash;If ever I enter into heaven it will be by the free grace of God.

<P><PB N="63" REF="013030_0061_0F94FB99CFD6EA98">He di&s;covered no anxiety about his body, or the death he was to die, all the way to the gallows, except once; which I think was occa&s;ioned by the falling of the end of the halter from under his arm.

<P>By this time we came in fight of the gallows; I de&s;ignedly took no notice of it, but watched the pri&s;oner to &s;ee how he would behave, expecting that the fight of it would give him a &s;hock. But he looked up, and &s;aid&mdash;

<P><PB N="65" REF="013030_0063_0F94FB9BB237A6E0">I a&s;ked him, whether he was &s;en&s;ible of this truth re&s;pecting Chri&s;t; and whether he had rea&s;on to think he could tru&s;t his guilty &s;oul on Him. He an&s;wered,
<Q>O, yes, there is no other way; where el&s;e can I hope. I want no other hope&mdash;the <HI>blood of Chri&s;t clean&s;eth,</HI> &amp;c &mdash;O, that I may be right&mdash;</Q>
I then prayed with him, and after prayer took an affectionate leave of him: At parting, he a&s;&s;ured me that his mind remained in the &s;ame &s;tate. I then retired a few &s;teps from him, leaving him to the exerci&s;e of his own thoughts. He laid his head on his coffin for &s;ome time, then kneeled down by it, and prayed &s;oftly. But it now being within 15 minutes of the time fixed for his execution, he was ordered to &s;tand upon his coffin: He obeyed at once. Being now tied up, and waiting the la&s;t minute, he addre&s;&s;ed the people in a few words,
<Q>Look at me, a &s;ight enough to melt a heart of &s;tone; I am going to die for my wickedne&s;s: But the death I am to die, is nothing compared with the death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t on the cro&s;s, for they pierced his hands and his &s;ide with a &s;pear. O take warning by me&mdash;If you were my own brethren, near to me as my own &s;oul, I could only tell you to beware of &s;tealing, &s;wearing, drinking,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked how long he had to live; and being told&mdash;He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;olemn prayer to God: Among other expre&s;&s;ions I recollect the fol|lowing&punc;
<Q>Lord have mercy on me the wor&s;t of &s;inners&punc; I can only &s;tand at a di&s;tance, and &s;ay God be merciful to me a &s;inner.&mdash;Lord it is better to tru&s;t in thee than to put confidence in man: It is better to tru&s;t in thee, than to put confidence
<PB N="66" REF="013030_0064_0F94FBA0AE245508">
in princes. If I peri&s;h, Lord Je&s;us, I will peri&s;h at thy feet; but the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t clean&s;|eth from all &s;in.</Q>
There were many other ex|pre&s;&s;ions which he u&s;ed in this his la&s;t addre&s;s to God, that appeared to me really &s;uitable to his ca&s;e. He again a&s;ked how long he had to live, and was an&s;wered 5 minutes.&mdash;He de&s;ired to know when the time was out; and looking wi&s;hfully at the &s;un, he &s;aid&mdash;<Q>That &s;un is almo&s;t down, but before it &s;ets, I &s;hall be in eternity; where I never was.</Q> And pulling the cap over his eyes again, he cried out, <HI>Lord Je&s;us into thy hands I commend my &s;pirit</HI>; as he fini&s;hed this &s;entence he was turned off; and died with great ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have only now to add, That both before, and &s;ince the execution of the <HI>unhappy youth,</HI> I made enquiry re&s;pecting his latter conduct; and have been informed more than once, by the family, who daily ob&s;erved him, that they never &s;aw &s;o great an alteration for the better in the temper and conduct of any man, in &s;o &s;hort a time, as in this youth.&mdash; And as far as he had opportunity, he di&s;covered a readine&s;s to forgive, and to do a kindne&s;s for his wor&s;t enemy. Thus he &s;aid he could chearfully, and heartily forgive the per&s;on, who, he declared, had &s;worn fal&s;ely again&s;t him on his trial, relative to his <HI>fir&s;t</HI>&punc; entring the hou&s;e of Mr. Bicker. Nor did he only forgive him, but when any of the neighbors &s;ent him victuals, he &s;aid, I can't eat it; carry it to A&mdash;, he wants it. This was an evidence of a chri&s;tian temper. Upon the whole, I cannot but think that he died a <HI>Penitent Thief.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="013030_0065_0F94FBA21AD36A98">Thus I have at the warm &s;olicitations of &s;ome of my friends, given an account of the exerci&s;e of mind of the late <HI>Levi Ames.</HI> They who, with the author, think that he died in faith, will admire this di&s;play of divine grace; and carefully a&s;cribe all the glory to God; knowing, that it is God who worketh in us to <HI>will,</HI> and to <HI>do</HI> of his own good plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is probable the author may have &s;ubjected him&s;elf to &s;ome unkind reflections, for taking &s;o much notice of a profligate youth, who made his exit on a gallows. But as an evangeli&s;t has men|tioned one penitent thief, he expects your indul|gence, in the preceding narrative of another.&mdash; The mo&s;t that can be &s;aid perhaps in this matter is, That the author has made a <HI>charitable mi&s;take</HI>; this &s;urely will be no great crime: Be&s;ides, charity &s;hall cover the multitude of faults.</P>
