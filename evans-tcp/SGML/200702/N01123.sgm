<HEAD>THE Redeemed Captive, Returning TO ZION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory I am going to Write, proves, That Days of <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> &amp; <HI>Prayer</HI> without REFORMATION, will not avail, to Turn away the Anger of God from a Profe&s;&s;ing People; &amp; yet Witne&s;&s;eth, How very advantagious, gracious Supplications are, to prepare particular Chri&s;tians, Patiently to &s;uffer the Will of God, in very trying Publick Calamities. For &s;ome of us moved with fear, &s;et apart, a day of <HI>Prayer,</HI> to ask of God, either to &s;pare, and &s;ave us from the hands of our Ene|mies, or to prepare us to Sanctify, and Honour Him in what way &s;oever, He &s;hould come &s;orth, towards us. The Places of Scripture from whence we were entertained, were <HI>Gen.</HI> 32. 10, 11. <HI>I am not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth which thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Deliver me, I pray

thee, from the hand of my Brother, from the hand of E&s;au: for I fear him, le&s;t he will come and &s;mite me, and the Mother with the Children.</HI> [In the forenoon.] And <HI>Gen.</HI> 32. 26. <HI>And he &s;aid, Let me go, for the day breaketh: and he &s;aid, I will not let thee go, except thou ble&s;s me.</HI> [In the afternoon.] From which we were call'd upon to &s;pread the cau&s;es of fear, relating to our own Selves, or Families before God; as al&s;o, how it becomes us with an undeniable importunity to be following God, with earne&s;t Prayers for His ble&s;&s;ing, in every condition. And it is very Ob&s;er|vable; how <HI>GOD</HI> ordered our Prayers, in a peculiar manner to be going up to Him; to prepare us with a right <HI>Chri&s;tian Spirit,</HI> to undergo, and endure Suffering Trials.</P>
<P>Not long after, the Holy, and Righteous God, brought us under great Trials, as to our Per&s;ons and Families, which put us under a nece&s;&s;ity, of &s;pread|ing before Him in a Wilderne&s;s, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dan|gers and calamities of our Relations; Yea, that call'd on us notwith&s;tanding &s;eeming pre&s;ent frowns, to re&s;olve by His Grace not to be &s;ent away with|out a ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Jacob</HI> in wre&s;tling has the hollow of his Thigh put out of joint; and it is &s;aid to him, <HI>Let me go:</HI> yet he is rather animated, to an Heroical Chri&s;tian re&s;olution to continue earne&s;t, for the ble&s;&s;ing, than di&s;couraged from asking.</P>
<P>ON the Twenty-ninth of <HI>February</HI> 1703, 4. Not long before break of day, the Enemy came in like a Flood upon us; our Watch being unfaithful&punc; an evil who&s;e awful effects, in a &s;ur|prizal

of our Fort, &s;hould be&s;peak all Watchmen to avoid, as they would not bring the charge of blood upon them&s;elves. They came to my Hou&s;e in the beginning of the On&s;et, and by their violent en|deavours to break open Doors, and Windows, with <HI>Axes,</HI> and <HI>Hatchets,</HI> Awaken'd me out of Sleep; on which I leapt out of bed, and running toward the door, perceived the Enemy making their entrance into the Hou&s;e: I called to awaken two Souldiers; in the Chamber; and returned towards my bed|&s;ide, for my Arms: the Enemy immediately brake into the Room, I judge to the number of Twenty, with <HI>Painted Faces,</HI> and hideous Acclamations. I reach'd up my hands to the Bed-te&s;ter, for my Pi&s;tol, uttering a &s;hort Petition to God, <HI>For Everla&s;ting Mercies for me &amp; mine, on the account of the Merits of our Glorify'd Redeemer;</HI> Expecting a pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;age through the Valley of the &s;hadow of Death: Saying in my &s;elf, as <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 38. 10, 11. <HI>I &s;aid, in the cutting off my days, I &s;hall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the re&s;idue of my years. I &s;aid, I &s;hall not &s;ee the Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the Living: I &s;hall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the World.</HI> Taking down my Pi&s;tol, I Cockt it, and put it to the brea&s;t of the fir&s;t Indian who came up; but my Pi&s;tol mi&s;&s;ing fire, I was &s;eized by Three Indians, who di&s;|armed me, and bound me Naked, as I was in, my Shirt, and &s;o I &s;tood for near the &s;pace of an hour: binding me, they told me they would carry me to <HI>Quebeck.</HI> My Pi&s;tol mi&s;&s;ing fire, was an occa&s;ion of my Life's being pre&s;erved: Since which I have al&s;o found it profitable to be cro&s;s'd in my own

Will. The judgment of God did not long &s;lumber&punc; again&s;t one of the Three which took me, who was a Captain, for by Sun-ri&s;ing he received a Mortal Shot&punc; from my next Neighbours hou&s;e; who oppo|&s;ed &s;o great a number of <HI>French</HI> &amp; <HI>Indians</HI> as Three hundred, and yet were no more than Seven men in an Ungari&s;on'd hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I cannot relate the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing care I had for my dear Wife, who had lien-in but a few Weeks before, and for my poor Children, Family, and Chri&s;tian Neighbours. The Enemy fell to riffling the hou&s;e, and entred in great numbers into every room of the hou&s;e. I beg'd of God, to Remember Mercy in the mid&s;t of Judgment: that He would &s;o far re&s;tain their Wrath, as to prevent their Mur|dering of us: that we might have <HI>Grace to Glorify His Name, whether in Life or Death;</HI> and as I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> able committed our State to God. The Enemies who entred the Hou&s;e were all of them <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Marqua's,</HI> in&s;ulted over me a while, holding up Hat|chets over my head, threatning to burn all I had; but yet God beyond expectation made us in a great mea&s;ure to be Pityed: for tho' &s;ome were &s;o cruel and barbarous as to take, &amp; carry to the door, Two of my Children and Murder them, as al&s;o a Negro Woman; yet they gave me liberty to put on my Clothes, keeping me bound with a Cord on one arm, till I put on my Cloths to the other; and then changing my Cord, they let me dre&s;s my &s;elf, and then Pinioned me again. Gave liberty to my dear Wife to dre&s;s her&s;elf, &amp; our Children. About Sun an hour high, we were all carryed out of the
<PB N="5" REF="001340_0011_0FB2822981BD30C0">
hou&s;e, for a March, and &s;aw many of the Hou&s;es of my Neighbours in Flames, perceiving the whole Fort, one hou&s;e excepted, to be taken. Who can tell, what Sorrows pierced our Souls, when we &s;aw our &s;elves carryed away from Gods Sanctuary, to go into a &s;trange Land, expo&s;ed to &s;o many Trials? the journey being at lea&s;t Three hundred Miles we were to Travel; the Snow up to the Knees, and we never inur'd to &s;uch hard&s;hips and fatigues&punc; the place we were to be carryed to, a Popi&s;h Coun|try. Upon my parting from the Town they fired my Hou&s;e &amp; Barn. We were carryed over the River, to the foot of the <HI>Mountain,</HI> about a Mile from my Hou&s;e, where we found, a great number of our Chri&s;tian Neighbours, Men, Women &amp; Chil|dren, to the number of an hundred, Nineteen of which were afterward Murdered by the Way, and Two &s;tarved to Death, near <HI>Cowa&s;s,</HI> in a time of great Scarcity or Famine, the Salvages underwent there. When we came to the foot of our Mountain, they took away our Shoes, and gave us, in the room of them Indian-Shoes, to prepare us for our Travel. Whil&s;t we were there the Engli&s;h beat out a Com|pany, that remained in the Town, and pur&s;ued them to the River, Killing and Wounding many of them; but the body of the Army, being Alarm'd, they repul&s;ed tho&s;e few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that pur&s;ued them.</P>
<P>I am not able to give you an account of the num|ber of the Enemy Slain, but I ob&s;erved after this fight, no great in&s;ulting Mirth, as I expected; and &s;aw many Wounded Per&s;ons, and for &s;everal days together they buryed of their party, &amp; one of chief

Note among the <HI>Macqua's.</HI> The Governour of <HI>Ca|nada,</HI> told me, his Army had that Succe&s;s with the lo&s;s but of Eleven men, Three French-men, One of which was the <HI>Lieutenant</HI> of the Army, Five <HI>Mac|qua's,</HI> and Three <HI>Indians:</HI> but after my Arrival at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> I &s;pake with an Engli&s;h man, who was ta|ken the la&s;t War, and Married there, and of their Re|ligion; who told me, they lo&s;t above Forty, and that many were Wounded: I replyed the Gover|nour of <HI>Canada</HI> &s;aid, they lo&s;t but Eleven men: He an&s;wered, 'tis true, That there were but Eleven kill|ed out-right at the taking of the Fort, but that many others were Wounded, among whom was the <HI>En&s;ign</HI> of the <HI>French;</HI> but &s;aid he, they had a fight in the Meadow, and that in both Engagements, they lo&s;t more than Forty. Some of the Souldiers, both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> then pre&s;ent told me &s;o (&s;aid he) add|ing, That the French always endeavour, to con|ceal the number of their Slain.</P>
<P>After this, we went up the Mountain, and &s;aw the &s;moak of the Fires in the Town, and beheld the awful de&s;olations of our Town: And before we marched any farther, they kill'd a Sucking Child of the Engli&s;h. There were &s;lain by the Enemy of the Inhabitants of our Town to the number of Thir|ty-eight, be&s;ides Nine of the Neighbouring Towns&punc; We Travel'd not far the fir&s;t day; God made the Heathen, &s;o to Pity our Children, that though they had &s;everal Wounded Per&s;ons, of their own to carry, upon their Shoulders, for Thirty Miles, before they came to the River, yet they carryed our Chil|dren, uncapable of Travelling, upon their Shoulders,

and in their Arms. When we came to our Lodg|ing place, the fir&s;t Night, they dugg away the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">now, and made &s;ome Wigwams, cut down &s;ome of the &s;mall branches of <HI>Spruce-trees</HI> to lye down on, and gave the Pri&s;oners &s;ome-what to eat; but we had but little Appetite. I was Pinioned, and bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">own that Night, and &s;o I was every Night whil&s;t I was with the Army. Some of the Enemy who brought drink with them, from the Town, fell to Drinking, and in their Drunken fit, they kill'd my Negro man, the only dead Per&s;on, I either &s;aw at the Town, or in the Way. In the Night an <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Man made his e&s;cape: in the Morning I was call'd for, and ordered by the General to tell the Engli&s;h, That if any more made their e&s;cape, they would burn the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners. He that took me was unwilling to let me &s;peak with any of the Pri&s;oners, as we March'd; but on the Morning of the Second day, he being appointed to guard the Rear, I was put into the hands of my other Ma&s;ter, Who permitted me to &s;peak to my Wife, when I overtook her, and to Walk with her to help her in her Journey. On the Way we di&s;cour&s;ed of the happine&s;s of them who had a right to <HI>an Hou&s;e not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens;</HI> and <HI>God for a Father, and Friend;</HI> as al&s;o, That it was our rea|&s;onable Duty, quietly to &s;ubmit, to the Will of God, and to &s;ay, <HI>The Will of the Lord be done.</HI> My Wife told me her &s;trength of body began to fail, &amp; that I mu&s;t expect to part with her; Saying, She hoped God would pre&s;erve my Life, and the Life of &s;ome, if not of all of our Children, with us; and

commended to me, under God, the care of them She never &s;pake any di&s;contented Word as to what had befal'n us, but with &s;uitable expre&s;&s;ions ju&s;tify|ed God, in what had befal'n us. We &s;oon made an halt, in which time my chief Surviving Ma&s;ter came up, upon which I was put upon Marching with the foremo&s;t, and &s;o made to take my la&s;t fare-well of my dear Wife, <HI>the de&s;ire of my Eyes,</HI> and companion in many Mercies and Afflictions. Upon our Sepa|ration from each other, we askt for each other, Grace &s;ufficient, for what God &s;hould call us to: After our being parted from one another, &s;he &s;pent the few remaining Minutes of her &s;tay, in Reading the Holy Scriptures; which &s;he was wont Per&s;onal|ly every day to delight her Soul in Reading, Pray|ing, Meditating of, and over, by her &s;elf, in her Clo&s;et, over and above what &s;he heard out of them in our Family Wor&s;hip.

this Mountain, the cruel and blood thir&s;ty Salvage who took her, &s;lew her with his Hatchet, at one &s;troak; the tidings of which were very awful: and y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;uch was the hard-heartedne&s;s of the Adver&s;ary, that my Tears were reckoned to me as a reproach. My lo&s;s, and the lo&s;s of my Children was great, our hearts were &s;o filled with Sorrow, that nothing but the comfortable hopes of her being taken away in Mercy, to her &s;elf, from the evils we were to &s;ee, feel and &s;uffer under; (and joyn'd to the A&s;&s;embly of the <HI>Spirits of ju&s;t men made perfect,</HI> to re&s;t in Peace, and <HI>joy un&s;peakable, and full of glory;</HI> and the good plea&s;ure of God thus to exerci&s;e us,) could have kept us from &s;inking under, at that time.

<P>We were again call'd upon to March, with a far heavier <HI>Burden on my Spirits,</HI> than on my <HI>Back,</HI> I beg'd of God, to Over-rule in His Providence, that the Corp&s;e of One &s;o dear to me, and of one who&s;e Spi|rit, He had taken to dwell with Him in Glory, might meet with a Chri&s;tian burial, and not be left for Meat, to the Fowls of the Air, and Bea&s;ts of the Earth: A Mercy that God graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afed to grant. For God put it into the hearts of my Neigh|bours, to come out as far as &s;he lay, to take up her Corp&s;e, recarry it to the Town, and decently to

bury it, &s;oon after. In our March they killed a|nother Sucking Infant of one of my Neighbours; and before Night, a Girl of about Eleven years of Age. I was made to Mourn, at the Con&s;ideration of my Flocks being &s;o far a Flock of Slaughter, ma|ny being Slain in the Town, and &s;o many Murdered in &s;o few Miles from the Town; and from fears what we mu&s;t yet expect, from &s;uch who delight|fully imbrued their hands in the blood of &s;o many of His People. When we came to our lodging Place, an Indian Captain from the <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> &s;pake to my Ma&s;ter about killing of me, and taking off my Scalp. I lift up my heart to God, to implore His Grace, and Mercy in &s;uch a time of need; and afterwards I told my Ma&s;ter, if he intended to kill me, I de&s;ired he would let me know of it, a&s;&s;uring him that my Death after a promi&s;e of Quarter would bring the guilt of blood upon him. He told me he would not kill me: We laid down and Slept for God Su&s;tained and kept us. In the Morning we were all called before the chief <HI>Sachems</HI> of the <HI>Mac|qua's,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> that a more equal di&s;tribution might be made of the Pri&s;oners, among them: at my going from the <HI>Wigwam,</HI> my be&s;t Clothing was taken away from me. As I came nigh the Place appoint|ed, &s;ome of the Captives met me, and told me, they thought the Enemies were going to burn &s;ome of us, for they had peeled off the bark from &s;everal Trees, and acted very &s;trangely. To whom I replyed, They could act nothing again&s;t us, but as they were per|mitted of God, and I was per&s;waded, He would pre|vent &s;uch Severities. When we came to the <HI>Wigwam</HI>

<P>In our fourth days March the Enemy killed ano|ther of my Neighbours, who being nigh the time of Travail, was wearied with her Journey. When we came to the great River, the Enemy took <HI>Slayes</HI> to draw their Wounded, &s;everal of our Children, and their Packs; and Marched a great pace. I Tra|velled many hours in Water up to the ankles: near Night I was very Lame, having before my Travel wrong'd my anckle-bone and &s;inews: I thought, &s;o did others, that I &s;hould not be able to hold out to Travel far. I lift up my Heart to God (my only refuge) to remove my Lamene&s;s, and carry me through with my Children and Neighbours, if He judg'd it be&s;t; however I de&s;ired God would be with me in my great Change, if He call'd me by &s;uch a Death to Glorify Him: and that He would take care of my Children, and Neighbours, and ble&s;s them; and within a little &s;pace of time, I was well of my Lamene&s;s, to the joy of my Children, and Neigh|bours, that &s;aw &s;o great an alteration in my Tra|velling.</P>
<P>On the Saturday, the Journey was long and tedious; we travelled with &s;uch &s;peed, that four Women were tired, and then Slain by them who led them Captive.</P>

<P>A little before Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s arrival, came a Souldi|er into my Land-lords hou&s;e <HI>Bure-foot,</HI> and <HI>Bare|leg'd,</HI> going on a Pilgrimage to <HI>Saint Anne.</HI> For &s;aid he, <HI>My Captain who dyed &s;ome years ago appeared to me, and told me, he was in Purgatory; and told me I mu&s;t go a Pilgrimage to Saint</HI> Anne, <HI>doing Penance, and get a</HI> Ma&s;s <HI>&s;aid for him, and then he &s;hould be delivered.</HI> And many believed him, and were much affected with it; came and told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e of it, to gain my Credit of their devi&s;ed <HI>Purgatory:</HI> the Souldier told me, <HI>The Prie&s;ts had coun&s;elled him to undertake this Pilgrimage.</HI> And I am apt to think, ordered his calling in at my Lord-lords, that I might &s;ee and &s;peak with him. I laught at the conceit, that a Souldier mu&s;t be pitch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon to be &s;ent on this errand; but they were much di&s;plea&s;ed, and lamented my ob&s;tinacy, in that I would not be reclaimed from a denyal of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> by &s;uch a <HI>Miraculous Providence.</HI></P>
<P>As I was able, I &s;pread the ca&s;e before God, be|&s;eeching of him to di&s;appoint them of their expecta|tions, to Pro&s;elyte any of the Captives by this Stra|tagem; and by the goodne&s;s of God it was not very Serviceable: for the Souldiers Conver&s;ation was &s;uch, that &s;everal among the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves judg+ed it to be a <HI>Forgery.</HI> And tho the Captain &s;poken of was the Governours Lady's Brother, I never more heard any concernment or care to get him out of <HI>Purgatory.</HI></P>
<P>One of the Pari&s;h where I lived, told me, That on the <HI>Twenty-&s;econd</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">5. He was at <HI>Que|beck,</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="001340_0053_0FB2842383D3FB00">
at the <HI>Mendicant Fryars Church,</HI> on one of their <HI>Fea&s;t Days,</HI> in honour of a great <HI>Saint</HI> of <HI>their Order,</HI> and that at Five a Clock Ma&s;s in the Morning, near Two hundred Per&s;ons pre&s;ent.

<P>When I was in the City in <HI>September,</HI> I &s;aw two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Maids who had lived with the <HI>Indians</HI> a long time.

<P>The Prie&s;ts, after Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s going from <HI>Canada,</HI> was ready to think their time was &s;hort, for gaining <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pro&s;elytes, and doubled their diligence and

wiles, to gain over Per&s;ons to their Per&s;wa&s;ion. I improved all opportunities I could, to Write to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that in that Way I might be Servicea|ble to them. But many or mo&s;t of my Letters treat|ing about Religion were intercepted, and burnt. I had a Letter &s;ent down to me by order of the Go|vernour, that I had a liberty of Writing to my Chil|dren and Friends, which &s;hould be continued; pro|vided I Wrote about indifferent things, and &s;aid no|thing in them about the points in controver&s;y be|tween them and us: And if I were &s;o hardy as to Write Letters otherwi&s;e, they &s;hould endeavour to prevent their being delivered. Accordingly, I found many of them were burnt. But &s;ometimes notice would be given to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that there were Let|ters written, but that they were burnt; &s;o that their Writing was &s;omewhat u&s;eful tho' never peru&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> becau&s;e they judged tho&s;e Letters con|demned <HI>Popery.</HI> Many of our Letters Written from <HI>New-England,</HI> were never delivered, becau&s;e of &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions about Religion in them. And as I &s;aid before, after Mr. <HI>Dudley'</HI>s departure from <HI>Quebeck,</HI> endeavours were very vigorous to &s;educe. Some were flattered with large Promi&s;es, others were threatned, and beaten, becau&s;e they would not turn. And when two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Women, who had alwayes op|po&s;ed their Religion were &s;ick in the <HI>Ho&s;pital:</HI> they kept with them Night and Day, till they dyed; &amp; their friends kept from coming to vi&s;it them: after their death they gave out, that they dyed in the <HI>Romi&s;h Faith,</HI> and were received into their <HI>Communion.</HI> Be|fore their Death Ma&s;&s;es were &s;aid for them; &amp; they
<PB N="49" REF="001340_0055_0FB284290CD746F8">
buried in the <HI>Church-yard</HI> with all their Ceremonies. And after this, Letters &s;ent into all parts to inform the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that the&s;e two Women turn'd to their Religion, before their Death, and that it concern|ed them to follow their Example, for they could not be more ob&s;tinate than the&s;e Women were in their Health, again&s;t the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Faith, and yet on a <HI>Death bed</HI> imbraced it. They told the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who lived near, <HI>That our Religion was a dangerous Religion to dye in.</HI> But I &s;hall hereafter relate the ju&s;t grounds we have to think the&s;e things were fal&s;ehoods.</P>
<P>I was informed, there was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Girl bid to take and wear the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Cro&s;s her &s;elf:</HI> She re|fu&s;ed; they threatned her, and &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wed her the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> At length, She had her choice, either to <HI>Cro&s;s her &s;elf,</HI> and take the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> or be <HI>Whipt,</HI> &s;he cho&s;e to be <HI>Whipt&punc;</HI> and they took up her Clothes, and made as tho' they would correct her; but &s;eeing her chu&s;ing indeed to &s;uffer rather than comply, they de&s;i&s;ted and tyed the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> about her Neck. Some were taken &amp; &s;hut up among their Religious, and all &s;orts of mean&punc; u&s;ed to gain them.</P>
<P>I received a Letter from one of my Neighbours, wherein he thus bewails.
   <Q>I obtained leave of my Ma&s;ter, to go to the <HI>Macqua</HI>-Fort to &s;ee my Chil|dren, that I had not &s;een for a long time: I car|ried a Letter from my Ma&s;ter; to &s;hew that I had leave to come. When I came to the Fort, I heard one of my Children was in the Woods.

But he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to let me &s;ee or &s;peak with him; and &s;aid, I had brought no Letter from the Gover|nour, and would not permit me to &s;tay in the Fort, tho' I had Travelled on foot near Fifty Miles for no other errand than to &s;ee and &s;peak with my Children.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame Per&s;on with another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man la&s;t Spring, obtained leave of the Governour General, to go to the &s;ame Fort on the &s;ame errand, &amp; carried Letters from the Governour to the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> that he might be permitted to &s;peak with his Children. The Letter was deliver'd to the <HI>Je&s;uits;</HI> who told him, his Son was not at home, but gone a Hunting. Whenas he was hid from them, as he heard after|ward, &s;o the poor man lo&s;t his labour a &s;econd time.

And that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man who accompanyed this poor man, went out into the Woods in hopes of finding the Lad; and &s;aw him, but the Lad run away, and that he followed him &amp; call'd after him, but he would not &s;top; but holding but a Gun threatned to &s;hoot him down, if he follow|ed him, and &s;o he was di&s;couraged, and turn'd back.

They judge this was told to the Governour, to prevent a|ny <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for the future going to &s;ee their Children and Neighbours. Some of ours &s;ay, they have been little better than ab&s;olutely promi&s;ed, to have their Children who are among the Salvages, in ca&s;e they them&s;elves would imbrace <HI>Popery.</HI> And that the Prie&s;ts had &s;aid, <HI>They had rather the Children &s;hould be among the</HI> Indians, <HI>as they did, than be brought out by the</HI> French, <HI>and &s;o be in a readine&s;s to return for</HI> New-England.</P>
<P>A <HI>Maid</HI> of our Town was put into a Religious hou&s;e among the <HI>Nuns,</HI> for more than two years, and all &s;ort of means, by flatteries, threatnings, and abu&s;ive carriages u&s;ed to bring her to turn. They offered her Money, which when refu&s;ed, e&s;pecially the latter part of the time, they threatned her very much; &s;ent for her before them, commanded her <HI>to Cro&s;s her &s;elf.</HI> She refu&s;ed, they hit her a box on the Ear; bid her again, &s;till &s;he refu&s;ed. The or|dered a rod with Six branches full of knots to be brought; and when &s;he refu&s;ed, they &s;truke her on the hands, with their renewing their Commands; and &s;he &s;tood to her refu&s;als, till her hands were fill'd with Whales, with the blows. But one &s;aid, Beat her no more, we will give her to the <HI>Indians,</HI> if &s;he wont turn.

This poor Girl had many Prayers go|ing up to Heaven for her daily, and by name, be|cau&s;e her Trials were more known to &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> than the Trials of others, who lived more re|mote from them.</P>
<P>Here might be an <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> by it &s;elf, of the Trials and Sufferings of many of our Children, and Young ones, who have been abu&s;ed, and after Separation from grown Per&s;ons, made to do as they would have them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here give an account of what was done to one of my Children, a Boy between Fifteen and Sixteen years of Age, Two hundred Miles di&s;tant from me, which occa&s;ioned grief and &s;orrow, that I want Words to utter; and yet kept under &s;uch awe, that he never d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;t Write any thing to me, for fear of being di&s;covered in Writing about Religion.

But when he &s;aw flattering Promi&s;es of rewards, and threatnings were ineffectual, he &s;truke him with a &s;tick he had in his hand; and when he &s;aw that would not do, he made him get down on his Knees about an hour, and then came and bid him make the &s;ign of the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> and that without any delay; he &s;till refu&s;ed. Then he gave him a couple of Strokes, with a Whip he had in his hand; which Whip had three Branches and about twelve great knotsty'd in it. And again bid him make the <HI>Sign of the Cro&s;s;</HI> and if it was any Sin, he would bear it him&s;elf: and &s;aid al&s;o, <HI>You are afraid you &s;hall be changed if you do it:</HI> but (&s;aid he) <HI>You will be the &s;ame, your Fingers wont be changed.</HI> And after he had made him &s;hed many Tears, under his abu&s;es and threatnings, he told him, <HI>He would have it done:</HI> And &s;o thro' Cowardi&s;e and Fear of the Whip, he made the Sign. And did &s;o for &s;everal days together with much ado, he was brought to <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> him&s;elf. And then the Ma&s;ter told him, <HI>He would have it done without his Particular bidding him.</HI> And when he came to &s;ay his Le&s;&s;on and Cro&s;s'd not him&s;elf, the Ma&s;ter &s;aid, <HI>Have you forgot what I bid you do.</HI> No Sir, &s;aid he, Then the School-ma&s;ter &s;aid, <HI>Down on your Knees;</HI> and &s;o kept him for an hour and half, till School was done: and &s;o did for about a Week.

<P>I Have her tran&s;cribed the Letter in the very words of it without the lea&s;t alteration: the &s;ame for &s;ub&s;tance was &s;ent to &s;everal other Cap|tives.

&s;ome blamed him for letting me know of it, becau&s;e (they &s;aid) they feared my Sorrow would &s;horten my days. He told me, he thought with him&s;elf that if he was in my ca&s;e, he &s;hould be willing to know the wor&s;t, and therefore told me as he would have de&s;ired to have known if in my place. I thank'd him, acknowledging it a favour to let me know of it: But the News was ready to Over-whelm me with Grief and Sorrow. <HI>I made my complaint to GOD, and Mourned before Him; Sorrow and Angui&s;h took hold up|on me.</HI> I ask'd of God to direct me what to do, and how to Write, and find out an opportunity of con|veying a Letter to him; and committed this diffi|culty to his Providence. I now found a greater op|po&s;ition to a Patient, Quiet, Humble, Re&s;ignation to the Will of God than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have known, if not &s;o tryed. Here I thought of my Af|flictions and Tryals; my Wife and Two Children kill'd, and many of my Neighbours; and my &s;elf, &s;o many of my Children and Friends in a Popi&s;h Captivity, &s;eparated from our Children, not capa|ble to come to them to in&s;truct them in the Way they ought to go; and cunning crafty Enemies, u|&s;ing all their &s;ubtilty to in&s;inuate into Young ones, &s;uch Principles as would be pernicious.

<P>I Have waited till now for an an&s;wer from you, hoping to hear from you, why you made an Abjuration of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Faith,</HI> for the <HI>Romi&s;h.</HI> But &s;ince you continue to neglect to Write to me about it, as you neglected to take any advice or coun&s;el from a Father, when you did it. I cannot forbear Writing again, and making &s;ome reflections on the Letter you Wrote me la&s;t, about the two Wo|men. It &s;eems to me from tho&s;e words of <HI>Abigail Turbet'</HI>s in your Letter&punc; or rather of Mr. <HI>Meriels,</HI> which you tran&s;cribed for him.

When <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> have &s;aid all they can, they are not able to prove, that the Saints in Heaven have a knowledge of what Pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are directed to them. Some &s;ay they know them one way, others &s;ay they have the knowledge of them in another way: and that which they have fix'd up&punc; on as mo&s;t probable to them, is, That they know of them from their beholding the face of God; Seeing God they known the&s;e Prayers: But this is a great mi&s;take. Tho' the Saints &s;ee and know God in a Glorious manner, yet they have not an in&s;inite knowledge; and it does no wayes follow that be|cau&s;e they &s;ee God, they know all Prayers that are directed to them upon the Earth. And God has no where in His Word told us, that the Saints have &s;uch a knowledge. Be&s;ides, were it a thing po&s;&s;ible for
<PB N="64" REF="001340_0070_0FB284548318DCA8">
them to have a knowledge of what Prayers are di|rected to them, it does not follow that they are to be Pray'd to, or have religious honour con|fer'd upon them. The <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> can neither give one Scripture Precept of Example for Praying to them; but God has provided a <HI>Mediator,</HI> who knows all our Petitions, and is Faithful and Merciful e|nough, and we have both Scripture Precept &amp; Ex|ample, to look to Him as our Mediator and Advocate with the Father. Further it can't be proved that its con&s;i&s;tent with the Saints being creatures, as well as with their happine&s;s, to have a knowledge of Pray|ers from all parts of the World at the &s;ame time, from many Millions together about things &s;o va&s;tly differing one from another: and then to pre&s;ent tho&s;e Supplications for all that look to them, its not Humility but Will Wor&s;hip.

<P>The Roman Catholick Church can't be a true Church of Chri&s;t, in that it makes Laws directly contrary to the Laws and Commands of Chri&s;t. As for example, in with-holding the Wine or the Cup from the Laiety, in the <HI>Lords-Supper;</HI> whenas Chri&s;t commands the &s;ame to drink who were to eat. Their eva&s;ion that the Blood is in the Body, and &s;o they partake of both in eating, is a great fallacy built on a fal&s;e foundation of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tanti|on.</HI> For when men eat, they can't be &s;aid to drink, which Chri&s;t commands, for Chri&s;t commands that we <HI>take the Cup and drink,</HI> which is not done in eating; be&s;ides the Prie&s;ts them&s;elves won't be &s;o put off. The words (<HI>this is my Body</HI>) do only in|tend, this doth &s;ignify of repre&s;ent my Body, which will appear if you compare Scripture with Scrip|ture, for after the Con&s;ecration the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> calls it Bread, and the fruit of the Vine. <HI>Exod.</HI> 12. 11. <HI>It is the Lords Pa&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver;</HI> that is, it repre&s;ents it. In all the Evangeli&s;ts, you read of killing and eating the Pa&s;&s;eover, a few lines or ver&s;es before the&s;e words, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> which plainly &s;how, that our Saviour in the &s;ame way of figurative expre&s;|&s;ion &s;peaks of the <HI>Go&s;pel Sacrament.</HI> If the&s;e words were taken as the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> expound them, he mu&s;t eat his own Body him&s;elf, whole and entire in

his own hands; and after that each one of the Di&s;|ciples eat him entire, and yet he &s;et at the Table whole, untouched at the &s;ame time; contradicti|ons impo&s;&s;ible to be defended by any rational ar|guments. Yea, his whole Body, mu&s;t be now in Heaven and in a thou&s;and other places, and in the mouth of every Communicant at the &s;ame time, and that both as a broken and unbroken Sacrifice, and be &s;ubject to putrefaction.

It's &s;aid, 1 Cor. 10. 4. <HI>And did all drink the &s;ame &s;piritual drink; for they drank of that &s;piritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Chri&s;t.</HI> Was Chri&s;t literally a Rock, think you? Yea, it's ab&s;urd to believe, that a Prie&s;t uttering a few words over a Wafer not above an inch &s;quare, can make it a God, or the Body of Chri&s;t entire as it was offered on the Cro&s;s. A bla&s;phemy to pretend to a power of making God at their plea&s;ure; &amp; then eat him, &amp; give him to others to be eaten, or &s;hut him up in their Altars: that they can utter the &s;ame words, and make a God or not make a God, ac|cording to their intention, and that the people are obliged to believe that it is God, and &s;o adore it, when they never hear any word of con&s;ecration, nor know the Prie&s;ts intention.

The Notion of it a fatal Snare to many Souls, who &s;in with hopes of ea&s;y getting Prie&s;tly ab&s;o|lutions at Death, and buying off Torments with their Money.

</LETTER>
<P>THis Prie&s;t Mr. <HI>Meriel,</HI> has brought many Let|ters to him and bid him Write them over and &s;end them, and &s;o he has done for many others. By this as al&s;o by Mrs. <HI>Stil&s;ons,</HI> &s;aying, She does not think that either of the&s;e Women did change their Religion before their Death; &s;he affirms al&s;o, that oftentimes during their Sickne&s;s, whil&s;t they had the u&s;e of their rea&s;on, they prote&s;ted again&s;t the

Romi&s;h Religion and Faith. Its evident that the&s;e Women never dyed <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> but that it was a wily Stratagem of the Prie&s;ts to advance their Religion; for Letters were &s;ent immediately, after their death, to u&s;e this as a per&s;wa&s;ive argument to gain others. But God in His Providence gave in farther Con|viction of their fallaciou&s;ne&s;s in this matter.</P>
<P>For the la&s;t Summer, one <HI>Biggilow</HI> of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> a Captive at <HI>Mont-Royal,</HI> was very Sick in the <HI>Ho&s;pi|tal,</HI> and in the judgment of all with a Sickne&s;s to Death. Then the Prie&s;ts and others gave out, that he was turned to be of their Religion, and taken in|to their communion: But contrary to their expecta|tion he was brought back from the gates of Death, and would comply with none of their rites: &s;ay|ing, that whil&s;t he had the u&s;e of his rea&s;on, he ne|ver &s;pake any thing in favour of their Religion. And that he never di&s;own'd the <HI>Prote&s;tant Faith,</HI> nor would he now. So that they were &s;ilenced and put to &s;hame. There is no rea&s;on to think that the&s;e two Women were any more <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> than he; but they are Dead and cannot &s;peak. One of the Wit|ne&s;&s;es &s;poken of in the fore-mentioned Letter, told me, &s;he knew of no &s;uch thing, and &s;aid Mr. <HI>Meriel</HI> told her, that he never heard a more fervent and affectionate Prayer, than one which <HI>E&s;ther Jones</HI> made a little before her Death. I am verily per&s;waded, that he calls that Prayer to God &s;o full of affection and confe&s;&s;ion, the confe&s;&s;ion made by her of the Sins of her whole Life. The&s;e two Women always in their health, and &s;o in their Sickne&s;s, oppo&s;ed all <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Principles, as all that knew them can te&s;tify,

&s;o long as they could be permitted to go and &s;peak with them. One of the&s;e Women was taken from the <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> and the other, namely <HI>E&s;ther Jones</HI> from <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>

When Mr. <HI>Sheldon</HI> came the &s;econd time, the Adver&s;aries did what they could to retard the time of our return, to gain time to &s;educe our Young Ones to <HI>Popery.</HI> Such were &s;ent away who were judged ungainable, and mo&s;t of the Younger &s;ort &s;till kept. Some &s;till flattered with Promi&s;es of reward; and great E&s;&s;ayes to get others Married among them. One debauched, and then in Twen|ty-four Hours of time Publi&s;hed, taken into their Communion &amp; Married; but the poor Soul has had time &s;ince to lament her Sin &amp; Folly, with a bitter cry; and a&s;ks your Prayers, that God of His So|vereign Grace would yet bring out of the horrible Pit, &s;he has thrown her &s;elf into.

I beg'd of God to bla&s;t this Helli&s;h De&s;ign of theirs, &s;o that in the i&s;&s;ue it might be to render their Religion more abominable, and that they might not gain one Soul by &s;uch a &s;tra|tagem. After &s;ome weeks had pa&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a&s;|&s;ertions, there came one into my Landlords Hou&s;e, affirming it to be a truth reported of <HI>Zebediah,</HI> &s;ay|ing, <HI>Jo&s;eph Egerly</HI> had been over the River, &amp; told one of our Neighbours this Story. After a few hours I &s;aw that Neighbour, and a&s;kt him whether he had &s;een <HI>Egerly</HI> lately; he &s;aid yes, What News told he to you? None &s;aid he. Then I told him what was affirmed as a truth; he an&s;wered, <HI>Egerly</HI> &s;aid nothing like this to him, and he was per&s;waded he would have told him, if there had been any truth in it. About a week after this, came one <HI>John Boult</HI> from the I&s;land of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> a Lad taken from <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> a very &s;erious &s;ober Lad of a|bout Seventeen years of Age; he had often before came over with <HI>Zebediah</HI> to vi&s;it me. At his com|ing in, he much lamented the lo&s;s of <HI>Zebediah,</HI> and told me, that for &s;everal weeks they had told him the &s;ame Story, affirming it to be a truth, and that <HI>Egerly</HI> was &s;o awakened by it, as to go again to Ma&s;s every day, urging him; &s;ince God in &s;uch a mira|culous way offered &s;uch conviction of the truth of their Religion, and the fal&s;hood &amp; danger of ours, to come over to their Religion, or el&s;e his damna|tion would be dreadfully aggravated. He (&s;aid he) could have no re&s;t for them day and night; but

(&s;aid he) I told them their Religion was contrary to the <HI>Word of God,</HI> and therefore I would not em|brace it; &amp; that I did not believe what they &s;aid. And &s;ays he, to me, one day I was &s;itting in the hou&s;e, and <HI>Egerly</HI> came in, and I &s;pake to him before the whole Family (in the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, for he could not &s;peak much <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>) and askt him of this Story, he an&s;wered, <HI>it's a great fal&s;hood,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>he never ap|peared to me, nor have I ever reported any &s;uch thing to any body; and that he had never been at the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s &s;ince</HI> Zebediah'<HI>s death.</HI> At the hearing of which they were &s;ilenced and put to &s;hame; we ble&s;&s;ed God together, for di&s;covering their wickedne&s;s, and di&s;|appointing them in what they aimed at, &amp; pray'd to God to deliver us and all the Captives from de|lu&s;ions, and recover them who had fallen, and &s;o parted. After which I took my Pen and wrote a Letter to one Mr. <HI>Samuel Hill,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captive, taken from <HI>Wells,</HI> who liv'd at <HI>Quebeck,</HI> &amp; his Bro|ther <HI>Ebenez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r Hill</HI> to make a di&s;covery of this lying Plot, to warn them of their danger, and a&s;&s;ure them of the fal&s;hood of this report; but the Letter fell into the hands of the Prie&s;ts, and was never delivered. This <HI>Egerly</HI> came home with us, &s;o that they gained nothing but &s;hame by this &s;trata|gem: God often di&s;appoints the crafty devices of wicked men.</P>
<P>In the latter end of Summer, they told me they had News from <HI>New-England</HI> by one who had been a Captive at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> who &s;aid that the Mini&s;ters at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> had told the <HI>French</HI> Captives, that the Pro|te&s;tant Religion was the only true Religion; and
<PB N="82" REF="001340_0088_0FB28481CB10AC10">
that as a confirmation of it, they would rai&s;e a dead per&s;on to life before their eyes for their con|viction; and that having per&s;waded one to feign him&s;elf dead, they came and pray'd over him, and then commanded him in the <HI>Name of Chri&s;t</HI> (who&s;e Religion they kept pure) to ari&s;e, they call'd and commanded, but he never aro&s;e; &s;o that in&s;tead of rai&s;ing the Dead, they killed the Living; which the bereav'd Relations di&s;covered. I told them, it was an old Lye and Calumny again&s;t <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin</HI> new vamped, and that they only change the per&s;ons and place: but they affirmed it to be a truth; I told them I wondred they were &s;o fond of a faith propagated, and then maintain'd by ly|ing words.</P>
<P>We were always out of hopes of being returned before Winter, the &s;ea&s;on proving &s;o cold in the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> and were praying to God to prepare our hearts, with all holy &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Holy Will, to Glorify his Holy Name in a way of pa&s;&s;ive Obedience in the Winter. For my own part, I was informed by &s;everal who came from the City, that the Lord <HI>Intendant</HI> &s;aid, if <HI>More</HI> re|turned and brought word that <HI>Battis</HI> was in Pri&s;on, he would put me into Pri&s;on, and lay me in Irons. They would not permit me to go into the City, &s;aying, I always did harm when I came to the Ci|ty, and if at any time I was at the City, they would per&s;wade the Governour to &s;end me back again.</P>
<P>In the beginning of la&s;t <HI>June,</HI> the Superior of the Prie&s;ts came to the Pari&s;h where I was, and
<PB N="83" REF="001340_0089_0FB28489B006E048">
told me, he &s;aw I wanted my Friend Captain <HI>de Beauville,</HI> and that I was ragged. But &s;ays he, your ob&s;tinacy again&s;t our Religion di&s;courages from providing better Cloaths; I told him it was bet|ter going in a ragged Coat, than with a ragged Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>In the beginning of la&s;t <HI>June,</HI> went out an Ar|my of Five Hundred <HI>Maqua's</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> with an intention to have fallen on &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Towns down <HI>Connecticut</HI> River, but lighting on a <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ok Indian,</HI> who ran away in the night, they were di&s;|couraged; &s;aying, he would alarm the whole Coun|try: about Fifty as &s;ome &s;ay, or Eighty as others, returned: Thus God re&s;trained their Wrath.</P>
<P>When they were promi&s;ing them&s;elves another Winter, to draw away the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to Popery, came News of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Briganteen a coming, and that the Honourable Capt. <HI>Samuel Appleton</HI> E&s;qr. was coming Amba&s;&s;ador, to fetch off the Captives, and Capt. <HI>John Bonner</HI> with him. I cannot tell you how, the Clergy and others laboured to &s;top many of the Pri&s;oners, to &s;ome Liberty, to &s;ome Mony, and yearly Pen&s;ions were offered, if they would &s;tay. Some they urged to tarry at lea&s;t till the Spring of the year, telling them it was &s;o late in the year, they would be lo&s;t by Shipwrack if they went now; &s;ome younger ones they told, if they went home they would be Damned and burn in Hell for ever, to affright them; day and night they were urging of them to &s;tay.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Infinitely Wi&s;e di&s;po&s;er of all things, who aims at His own Glory, in the Go|verning of Rational Creatures, doth &s;ometimes bring Per&s;ons into the depths of di&s;tre&s;s, and then magnify his Power &amp; Grace in rai&s;ing them up out of their afflictions: and in many re&s;pects by &s;uch things, He has a de&s;ign of ad|vancing His own Honour &amp; Glory in the World. We find in the context, a Per&s;on in a very doleful di&s;tre&s;s'd condition: he &s;eems to be for&s;aken of God, and made a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and dwelling Place of Evil Spirits, deprived of all humane comforts &amp; delights, made to po&s;&s;e&s;s Sorrow and Pain to &s;uch a degree, as to be a common Subject, or Theme of di&s;cour&s;e for all men to relate doleful things about. And after|ward, God in very remarkable &amp; wonderful works of Power and Mercy not only gives relea&s;e from his &s;orrowful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but he is <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ting at the feet of Je&s;us, cloathed, &amp; in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mind.</HI> Now this was done for the declarative and manife&s;tative Glory &amp; Ho|nour of God.

things had been done, Petitions Chri&s;t that he may abide with Him, to hear from Him, and Pay his re&s;pects to him; he receives commandment, to be glorifying the Power &amp; Mercy of God, in declaring to others what great things God had done for him.</P>

<P N="3">3. His obedience to the great command of Chri&s;t: he went and publi&s;hed the great things done for him by Chri&s;t; &s;o that from the command of Chri&s;t, &amp; his obedience to it, for which he is commended, you may ob&s;erve this Doctrinal Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<Q>DOCT. It well becomes tho&s;e who have had eminent Mercies, to be &s;hewing to others what Great things GOD has done for them.</Q>

<P N="1">1. They who have had Mercies, have had them from God. God is the be&s;tower and giver of all our good things: All our Mercies come to us by a Divine Providence, and ordering; not by ca&s;ualty and accident, neither are they of our own procu|ring and purcha&s;ing, or others, &s;o as to exclude the providential di&s;po&s;ing of God. 'Tis God who re|turns the Captivity of Zion, P&s;al. 126. <HI>begin. When the Lord turned again the Captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream: Then was our mouth filled with laugh|ter, and our tongue with &s;inging. Then &s;aid they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad: turn again our Captivity O Lord.</HI> The very Heathen, acknowledge the good things be|&s;towed upon, and done for the Church, to be from God; and Gods own People acknowledge Him for the Mercies granted, and humbly &s;upplicate Mer|cies from Him for the future. 'Tis God who ga|thers the out-ca&s;ts of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> 'tis He who takes away the Captives of the Mighty, the Prey of the terri|ble: Who contends with them that contend with us, &amp; &s;aves our Children. 'Tis God who di&s;per&s;eth and gathers again: Therefore the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 103. <HI>begin.</HI> Calls upon his Soul to ble&s;s the Lord,

<P N="2">2. It well becomes tho&s;e who have had eminent Mercies, to be &s;howing to others what great things God hath done for them. Therefore you find the holy P&s;almi&s;t calling upon others, to give a li&s;tning ear, whil&s;t he makes a Narration of the Salvations he had from God, P&s;al. 66.16. <HI>Come and hear all you that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t. Rea&s;on.</HI> Becau&s;e God aimed at the advance|ment of His Own Honour and Glory, in the giving and dealing out of the&s;e Mercies. God makes and di&s;po&s;eth all things for His own Honour and Glory. All Works of Providence, are &s;ome way or other to advance the Honour &amp; Glory of God in the World. The glory of His Power, Wi&s;dom, Mercy, Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s, are &s;ome way or other advanced in a declarative and manife&s;tative way and manner. Now it well becomes us, to fall in with the de&s;ign of God, and in an active manner to be giving Him Glory. That God de&s;igns to have Glory given to Him, is evident from, P&s;al. 50. 15. <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
