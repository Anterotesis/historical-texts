<P>Sinners, <HI>What will you do? Evil</HI> is <HI>Pur&s;uing</HI> of you, even of as many of you, as are yet in your <HI>Unregeneracy.</HI> And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; You cannot <HI>Avoid</HI> the <HI>Evil.</HI> Which way, I marvel, which way can you propo&s;e to <HI>Avoid</HI> it? Will you <HI>Ab&s;cond?</HI> No; That cannot be done. You are ad|vi&s;ed; P&s;al. 139. 7. <HI>Lord, whither &s;hall I flee from thy pre&s;ence?</HI> Will you <HI>Re&s;i&s;t?</HI> No; That cannot be done. You are ad|vi&s;ed; Ezek. 22. 14. <HI>Can thine Heart en|dure, or can thy Hands be &s;trong, in the Day that I &s;hall deal with thee, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> Or, will you <HI>Run</HI> &s;o fa&s;t, that the <HI>Pur&s;uer</HI> cannot come up with you? No, No; He has told you, Mal. 3. 5. <HI>I will be a &s;wift Witne&s;s again&s;t them, that fear not me, &s;aith the Lord of Hosts.</HI></P>
<P>And then, Secondly; You cannot <HI>En|dure</HI> the <HI>Evil:</HI> Tis <HI>Intolerable!</HI> Tis <HI>In|tolerable!</HI> It is Cryed out, Prov. 18. 14. <HI>A wounded &s;pirit, who can bear?</HI> When a few Drops of that <HI>Evil,</HI> which is impen|ding

Thou art falling down into an <HI>Evil,</HI> to which the mo&s;t <HI>Fiery Tortures,</HI> are but a <HI>Metaphor!</HI> It was Exclamed of old; P&s;al 76. 7. <HI>O God, who may &s;tand in thy &s;ight, when once thou art Angry?</HI></P>
