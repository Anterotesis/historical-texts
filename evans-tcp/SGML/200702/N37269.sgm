<HEAD>A NARRATIVE &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the latter end of the month of March, or the beginning of April of the year 1782, the we&s;tern indians began to make incur&s;ions upon the frontier of Ohio, Wa&s;hington, Youghagany and We&s;tmoreland counties, which has been their con&s;tant practice ever &s;ince the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters">m|mencement of the pre&s;ent war be<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> United States and Great Britain.</P>

by unavoidable accident were to be replaced by hor&s;es taken in the enemy's country.</P>
<P>The time appointed for the rendezvous, or general meeting of the volunteers, was fixed to be on the 20th May, and the place, the old Mingoe town on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river Ohio, about forty miles be|low Fort Pitt by land, and I think about 75 by water.</P>
<P>Col. Crawford was &s;olicited by the Gen|eral voice of the&s;e we&s;tern counties and di&s;tricts to command the expedition. He accordingly &s;et out as volunteer and came to Fort Pitt two days before the time ap|pointed for the a&s;&s;embling of the men. As there was no &s;urgeon yet appointed to go with the expedition, Col. Crawford begged the favour of Gen. Irvine to permit me to accompany him, (my con&s;ent having been previou&s;ly a&s;ked) to which the General a|greed provided Col. Gib&s;on did not object.</P>
<P>Having obtained permi&s;&s;ion of the Colo|nel I left Fort Pitton Tue&s;day, May 1&s;t, &amp; the next day about one in the afternoon arrived at the Mingoe bottom. The volun|teers had not all cro&s;&s;ed the river until Fri|day morning the 24th then they di&s;tri|buted

them&s;elves into eighteen companies, choo&s;ing their captains by vote.</P>
<P>There were cho&s;en al&s;o, one Col. Com|mandant, four field and one brigade-major.</P>
<P>There were four hundred and &s;ixty five who voted.</P>
<P>We began our march of Saturday May 25th, making almo&s;t a due we&s;t cour&s;e, and and on the 4th, day reached the old Mora|vian town upon the river Mu&s;kingum, a|bout 60 miles from the river Ohio. Some of the men having lo&s;t their hor&s;es on the night preceding returned home. Tue&s;day the 28th in the evening, Major Brenton, and Captain Bean, went &s;ome di&s;tance from camp to reconnoitre: Having gone about one quarter of a mile they &s;aw two India is up on whom they fired, &amp; then returned to camp&punc; This was the fir&s;t place in which we were di&s;|covered as we under&s;tood afterwards. On Thur&s;day the 4th, of June, which was the eleventh day of our march, about one o'clock we came to the &s;pot where the town of Sandu&s;ky formerly &s;tood: the inhabitants had moved 18 miles lower down the creek, near the lower Sandu&s;ky; but as neither our guides nor any that were with us, had known any thing of their removal we be|gan
<PB N="5" REF="048810_0005_1026850547A98C40">
to conjecture that there were no Indian towns nearer than the lower Sandu&s;ky, which was at lea&s;t 40 miles di&s;tant.</P>
<P>However, after refre&s;hing our hor&s;es, we advanced on in &s;earch of &s;ome of their &s;et|tlements but had &s;carcely got the di&s;tance of three or four miles from the old town when a number of our men expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire to return, &s;ome of them alledging they had only five day's provi&s;ion: upon which the field officers and Captains, de|termined, in council, to proceed that af|ternoon, and no longer. Previous to the calling of this council, a &s;mall party of light hor&s;e had been &s;ent forward to reconnoi|tre.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here remark, by the way, that there are a great many exten&s;ive plains in that country; the woods in general grow very thin, free from bru&s;h and underwood; &s;o that light hor&s;e-men may advance a con&s;id|erable di&s;tance before an army without be|ing much expo&s;ed to the enemy.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the council ended, an expre&s;s re|turned from the above mentioned party of light hor&s;e with intelligence, &punc;that they had been about three miles in front, and had &s;een a large body of Indians running
<PB N="6" REF="048810_0006_102685B75933ACE8">
towards them.&mdash;In a &s;hort time we &s;aw the re&s;t of the light hor&s;e, who joined us, and having gone one mile further met a number of Indians who had partly gotten po&s;&s;e&s;ion of a piece of woods before us, whil&s;t they were in the plains; but our men alighting from their hor&s;es and ru&s;hing in|to the woods, &s;oon obliged them to retreat from the place.</P>
<P>The enemy being by this time reinforced, flanked to the right, and part of them com|ing in our rear, quickly made the action more &s;erious. The firing continued very warm on both &s;ides from four o'clock until the du&s;k of the evening: each party main|taining its ground. Next morning about &s;ix o'clock &s;ome guns were di&s;charged at the di&s;tance of two or three hundred yards&punc; which continued till day, doing little or no execution on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The field officers then a&s;&s;embled and a greed as the enemy were every moment in|crea&s;ing, &amp; we had already a number wounded, to retreat that night. The whole body was to form into three lines, keeping the wounded in the centre.</P>
<P>We had four killed &amp; twenty three wounded, of the latter, &s;even very danger|ou&s;ly,
<PB N="7" REF="048810_0007_102685B9A1DD4BD8">
on which account as many biers were got ready to carry them; mo&s;t of the re&s;t were &s;lightly wounded, none &s;o bad but they could ride on hor&s;e-back. After dark the officers went on the out po&s;ts, and brought in all the men as expeditiou&s;ly as they could&punc; Ju&s;t as the troops were about to form, &s;ev|eral guns were fired by the enemy, upon which &s;ome of our men &s;poke our &amp; &s;aid, our intention was di&s;covered by the Indians who were &s;iting alarm guns. Upon which &s;ome in front hurried off, &amp; the re&s;t imme|diately followed, leaving the &s;even men that were dangerou&s;ly wounded, &s;ome of whom however got off on hor&s;eback, by means of &s;ome good friends who waited for, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them.</P>
<P>We had not got a quarter of a mile from the field of action, when I heard Col. Crawford calling for his &s;on John Crawford his &s;ON-in-law Maj. Harri&s;on, Maj Ro&s;e and William Crawford, his nephews, upon which I came up and told him I believed they were before us&mdash;He a&s;ked was that the Docter? I told him it was; he then replied they were not in front, and begged of me not to leave him&mdash;I promi&s;ed him I would not.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="048810_0008_102685BB5E78FAC8">
We then waited &amp; continued calling for the&s;e men till the troops had pa&s;&s;ed us.</P>
<P>The Col. told me his hor&s;e had almo&s;t given out, that he could not keep up with the troops, and wi&s;hed &s;ome of his friends to remain with him: he then exclaimed a|gain&s;t the militia for riding off in &s;uch an irregular manner, and leaving &s;ome of the wounded behind, contrary to his orders&punc;</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently there came two men riding af|ter us, one of them an old man, the other a lad: we enquired if they had &s;een any of the above per&s;ons? they an&s;wered they had not.</P>
<P>By this time there was a very hot firing before us, and as we judged, near where, our main body mu&s;t have been. Our cour&s;e was then nearly &s;outh-we&s;t, but changing it, we went north about two miles, the two men remaining in company with us&punc; Judg|ing our&s;elves, to be now out of the ene|my's lines, we took an ea&s;t cour&s;e, taking care to keep at the di&s;tance of fifteen or twenty yards apart, and directing our&s;elves by the north &s;tar.</P>
<P>The old man often lagged behind, and when this was the ca&s;e never failed to call for us to halt for him. When we were near
<PB N="9" REF="048810_0009_102685BEEBC5CB98">
the Sandu&s;ky Creek he fell one hundred yards behind and bawled out, as u&s;ual, for us to halt. While we were preparing to repri+mand him for making a noi&s;e, I heard an Indian holloe, as I thouht 150 yards from the man, and partly behind him; and after this we did not hear the man call again, neither did he ever come upto us any more. It was now pa&s;t midnight, and about day-break Col. Crawford's and the young man's hor&s;es gave out, and they left them.</P>
<P>We pur&s;ued our journey ea&s;t ward, and about two o'clock fell in with Capt. Biggs, who had carried Lieut&punc; A&s;hly from the fiield of action who had been dangerou&s;ly wounded. We then went on about the &s;pace of an hour, when a heavy rain coming on, we concluded it was be&s;t to encamp, as we were encumbered with the wounded officer.</P>
<P>We then barked four or five trees, made an encampment and a fire in which place we remained that night. Next morning we again pro&s;ecuted our journey, and hav|ing gone about three miles, found a deer which had been recently killed. The meat was &s;liced from the bones and bundled up in the &s;kin, with a tomahawk lying by it. We carried all with us and in advancing a|bout
<PB N="10" REF="048810_0010_102685C08A0E91D8">
one mile further, e&s;pying the &s;moke of a fire. We then gave the wounded officer into the charge of the young man, de&s;iring him to &s;tay behind whil&s;t the Colonel, the Captain, and my&s;elf, walked up as cautiou&s;|ly as we could toward the fire. When we came to it, we concluded from &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances &s;ome of our people had encam|ped there the preceding night. We then went about roa&s;ting the veni&s;on, and when ju&s;t about to march ob&s;erved one of our men coming upon our tracks He &s;eemed at fir&s;t very &s;hy, but having called to him he came up and told us he was the per&s;on who killed the deer, but upon hearing us come up, was afraid of Indians, hid in a thicket and made off. Upon this we gave him &s;ome bread and roa&s;ted veni&s;on and proceed|ed all together on our journey: about two o'clock we came upon the paths by which we had gone out. <HI>C</HI>apt. Biggs and my&s;elf did not think it &s;afe to keep the road. but the <HI>C</HI>olonel &s;aid the <HI>I</HI>ndians would not follow the troops farther than the plains, which we were con&s;iderably pa&s;t. As the wounded of|ficer rode <HI>C</HI>apt. Biggs' hor&s;e <HI>I</HI> let the <HI>C</HI>ap|tain mine, the <HI>C</HI>olonel and my&s;elf went a|bout
<PB N="11" REF="048810_0011_102685C2EA97EA58">
one hundred yards in front, the <HI>C</HI>ap|tain and the wonded officer in the centre, and the two young men behind. After we had travelled about one mile and a half, &s;everal <HI>I</HI>ndians &s;tarted up within fifteen or twenty &s;teps of the <HI>C</HI>olonel and me. As we at fir&s;t di&s;covered only three <HI>I</HI> immedi|ately got behind a large black oak, made ready my piece and rai&s;ed it up to take &s;ight, when the <HI>C</HI>olonel called to me twice not to fire: upon that one of the <HI>I</HI>ndians ran up to the colonel and took him by the hand.</P>
<P>They were Delaware <HI>I</HI>ndians of the Win|genim tribe. <HI>C</HI>aptain. Biggs fired among&s;t them but did no execution; they then told us to call the&s;e people &amp; make them come, el&s;e they would go and kill them; which the <HI>C</HI>olonel did but they four got off and e&s;ca|ped for that time.</P>
<P>The <HI>C</HI>olonel and <HI>I</HI> were taken to the <HI>I</HI>ndian camp, which was about half a mile from the place where, we were captured.</P>
<P>On Sunday evening five Delawares who had po&s;ted them&s;elves at &s;ome di&s;tance fur|ther on the road, brought back to the camp, where we lay, <HI>C</HI>aptain Biggs and Lieutenant A&s;hley's &s;calps with an Indian &s;calp which

Captain Biggs had taken in the field of ac|tion&punc; They al&s;o brought in Biggs' hor&s;e and mine, they told us the other two men got away from them.</P>
<P>Monday morning the tenth of June, we were paraded to march to Sandu&s;ky, about 33 miles di&s;tant: they had eleven pri&s;oners of us and four &s;calps, the <HI>I</HI>ndians being &s;ev|enteen in number. Col. <HI>C</HI>rawford was ver|y de&s;irous to &s;ee a certain Simeon Girty, who lived among the <HI>I</HI>ndians, &amp; was on that account permitted to go to town the &s;ame night, with two warriors to guard him have|ing orders at the &s;ame time to pa&s;s by the place where the <HI>C</HI>olonel had turned out his hor&s;e that they might if po&s;&s;ible, find him.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of us were taken as far as the old town, which was within eight miles of the new.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day morning, the 11th, <HI>C</HI>ol. <HI>C</HI>rawford was brought out on purpo&s;e to be marched in with the other pri&s;oners. <HI>I</HI> a&s;ked the <HI>C</HI>o|lonel if he had &s;een Mr. Girty? he told me he had, and that Girty had promi&s;ed to do every thing in his power for him, but that the <HI>I</HI>ndians were very much enraged again&s;t the pri&s;on|ers:
<PB N="13" REF="048810_0013_102684DDAD6C47D8">
particularly Capt. Pipe, one of the Chiefs He likewi&s;e told me that Girty had informed him that his &s;on-in-law, Col. Harri&s;on and his Nephew William Crawford, were made pri&s;oners by the Shawane&s;e, but had been par|doned. This Capt. Pipe had come from the towns about an hour before Col. Crawford, and had painted all the pri&s;oner's faces black.</P>
<P>As he was painting me he told me I &s;hould go to the Shawane&s;e towns and &s;ee my friends.</P>
<P>When the Col. arrived he painted him black al&s;o, told him he was glad to &s;ee him and that he would have him &s;haved when he came to &s;ee his friends at the Wyandot town. When we marched the Colonel and I were kept back be|tween Pipe and Wyngenim, the two Deleware chiefs, the other nine pri&s;oners were &s;ent for|ward with another party of Indians. As we went a long we &s;aw four of the pri&s;oners lying by the path tomabawked and &s;calped, &s;ome of them were at the di&s;tance of half a mile from each other When we arrived within half a mile of the place where the Colonel was execu|ted, we overtook the five pri&s;oners that remai|ned alive: The Indians had cau&s;ed them to &s;it down on the ground, as they did, al&s;o the Col. and me at &s;ome di&s;tance from them, I was there given in charge to an Indian fellow to be ta|ken to the Shawane&s;e towns.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="048810_0014_102685CB40213BD0">
In the place where we were now made to &s;it down there was a number of &s;quaws and boys who fell on the five pri&s;oners tomahawked them. There was a certain John M'Kinley a|mong&s;t the pri&s;oners, formerly an officer in the 13th, Virginia regiment, who&s;e head an old &s;quaw cut off, and the Indians kicked it about upon the ground. The young Indian fellows came often where the Colonel and I were and da&s;hed the &s;calps in our faces. We were then conducted along toward the place where the Colonel was afterwards executed: When we came within about half a mile of the place, Si|meon Girty met us, with &s;everal Indians on hor&s;eback: He &s;poke to the Colonel, but as I was about one hundred and fifty yards behind could not hear what pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every Indian we met &s;truck us either with &s;ticks or their fi&s;ts. Girty waited till I was brought up, and a&s;ked was that Doctor?&mdash;I told him, yes, and went towards him reach|ing out my hand, but he bid me begone, and called me a dam'd ra&s;cal; upon which the fel|low who had me in charge pulled me along.</P>
<P>Girty rode up after me and told me I was to go to the Shawane&s;e towns.</P>
<P>When we were come to the fire the Colonel was &s;tripped naked, ordered to &s;it down by the
<PB N="15" REF="048810_0015_102685CE4A522A88">
fire, and then they beat him with &s;ticks and their fi&s;ts. Pre&s;ently after I was treated in the &s;ame manner. They then tied a rope to the foot of a po&s;t about fifteen feet high, bound the Colonels hands behind his back and fa&s;tened the rope to the ligature between his wri&s;ts.</P>
<P>The rope was long enough either to &s;it down or walk round the po&s;t once or twice and return the &s;ame way. The Colonel then called to Girty and a&s;ked if they intended to burn him? Girty an&s;wered yes. The Colonel &s;aid he would take it patiently. Upon this Capt. Pipe a Delaware Chief, made a &s;peech to the Indians <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> about thirty or forty men, &s;ixty or &s;eventy &s;quaws and boys.</P>
<P>When the &s;peech was fini&s;hed they all yelled a hedious and hearty a&s;&s;ent to what had been &s;aid. The Indian men then took up their guns and &s;hot powder into the Colonel's body, from his feet as far up as his neck. I think not le&s;s than &s;eventy loads were di&s;charged up|on his naked body. They then crowded about him, and to the be&s;t of my ob&s;ervation, cut off his ears: when the throng had di&s;per&s;ed a little I &s;aw the blood running from both &s;ides of his head in con&s;equence thereof.</P>
<P>The fire was about &s;ix or &s;even yards from the po&s;t to which the Colonel was tied: it was made
<PB N="16" REF="048810_0016_102685D17667D758">
of &s;mall hickory poles, burnt quite through in the middle, each end of the poles remaining a|bout &s;ix feet in length. Three or four Indians by turns would take up, individually, one of the&s;e burning pieces of wood and apply it to his naked body, already burned black with powder. The&s;e tomentors pre&s;ented them|&s;elves on every &s;ide of him, &s;o that which ever way he ran round the po&s;t they met him with the burning faggots and poles. Some of the &s;quaws look broad boards upon which they would put a quantity of burning coals and hot embers, and throw on him, &s;o that in a &s;hort time he had nothing but coals of fire and hot a&s;hes to walk upon. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e ex|treme tortures he called to Simeon Girty and begged of him to &s;hoot him: But Girty ma|king no an&s;wer he called to him again. Girty then by way of deri&s;ion, told the Colonel he had no gun, at the &s;ame time turning about to an In|dian who was behind him, laughed heartily and by all his ge&s;tures &s;eemed delighted at the horrid &s;cene.</P>
<P>Girty then came up to me and bade me pre|pare for death. He &s;aid, however, I was not to die at that place, but to be burnt at the Shawane&s;e towns. He &s;wore by G&mdash;d I need not expect to e&s;cape death, but &s;hould &s;uffer it in all its extremities.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="048810_0017_102685D516AC1F78">
He then ob&s;erved that &s;ome pri&s;oners had given him to under&s;tand that if our people had him they would not hurt him; for his part, he &s;aid, he did not believe it, but de&s;ired to know my opinion of the matter; but being at that time in great angui&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s for the torments the Colonel was &s;uffering before my eyes, as well as the expectation of under|going the &s;ame fate in two days. I made lit|tle or no an&s;wer. He expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of ill will for Col. Gib&s;on, and &s;aid he was one of his greate&s;t enemies, and more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to all which I paid very little attenti|on.</P>
<P>Col. Crawford at this period of his &s;uffer|ings, be&s;ought the Almighty to have mercy on his &s;oul, &s;poke very low, and bore his tor|ments with the mo&s;t manly fortitude. He continued in all the extremities of pain for an hour &amp; three quarters or two hours longer, as near as I can judge, when at la&s;t being almo&s;t &s;pent he lay down on his belly: They then &s;calp|ed him &amp; repeatedly threw the &s;calp in my face, te ling me "that was my great Captain."&mdash;An old &s;quaw (who&s;e appearance every way an&s;wered the ideas people entertain of the devil) got a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ard, took a parcel of coals &amp; a&s;hes &amp; laid them on his back and head after he had
<PB N="18" REF="048810_0018_102685D7451AA018">
been &s;calped: He then rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his feet and began to walk round the po&s;t: They next put a burning &s;tick to him as u&s;ual, but he &s;eemed more in&s;en&s;ible of pain than before.</P>
<P>The Indian fellow who had me in charge, now took me away to Capt. Pipe's hou&s;e, a|bout three quarters of a mile from the place of the Colonel's execution. I was bound all night and thus prevented from &s;eeing the la&s;t of the horrid &s;pectacle. Next morning, be|ing June 12th, the Indian untied me, painted me black, and we &s;et off for the S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">wane&s;e town, which he told me was &s;omewhat le&s;s than forty miles from that place. We &s;oon came to the &s;pot where the Colonel was burnt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was partly in our way; I &s;aw his bones <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ying among&s;t the remains of the fire, almo&s;t burnt to a&s;hes, I &s;uppo&s;e after he was dead the had laid his body on the fire.</P>
<P>The Indian told me, that was my Big Captain and gave the &s;calp halloo. He was on hor&s;eback and drove me before him.</P>
<P>I pretended to this Indian I was ignorant of the death I was to die at the Shawane&s;e town, affected as cheerful a countenance as po&s;&s;ible and a&s;ked him if we were not to live togeth|er as brothers in one hou&s;e when we &s;hould get to the town? He &s;eemed well plea&s;ed, and

&s;aid, yes. He then a&s;ked me if I could make a wigwam? I told him I could&mdash;he then &s;eemed more friendly&mdash;we went that day as near as I can judge about 25 miles, the cour&s;e partly &s;outh we&s;t&mdash;The Indian told me we &s;hould next day come to the town the &s;un be|ing in &s;uch a direction, pointing nearly &s;outh.</P>
<P>At night when we went to re&s;t I attempted very often to unite my&s;elf, but the Indian was Extremely vigilent and &s;carce ever &s;hut his eyes that night. About day break he got up and untied me: He next began to mend up the fire, and as the gnats were trouble&s;ome I a&s;ked him if I &s;hould make a &s;moak behind him? he &s;aid, yes, I then took the end of a dogwood <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which had been burnt down to about eighteen inches in length: It was the longe&s;t &s;tick I could find, yet too &s;mall for the purpo&s;e I had in view: then I picked up another &s;maller &s;tick and taking a coal of fire between them went behind him: then turning &s;uddenly about I &s;truck him on the head with all the force I was ma&s;ter of; which &s;o &s;tunned him that he fell forwards with both his hands into the fire, but &s;eeing him recover and get up, I &s;eized his gun while he ran off howling in a mo&s;t fearful man|ner&mdash;I followed him with a determination to &s;hoot him down, but pulling back the cock of
<PB N="20" REF="048810_0020_102685DB16160D80">
the gun with great violence I believe I broke the main &s;pring. I pur&s;ued him, however a|bout thirty yards &s;till endeavouring to fire the gun, but could not; then going back to the fire I took his blanket, a pair of new mokki&s;ons, his hoppes, powder horn, bullet bag, (together with the gun) and marched off, directing my cour&s;e toward the five o'clock mark; about half an hour before &s;un&s;et I came to the plains which I think are about sixteen miles wide. I laid me down in a thicket till dark, and then by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the north &s;tar made my way through them and got into the woods before morning. I proceeded on the next day about noon cro&s;&s;ed the paths by which our troops had none out: The&s;e paths are nearly ea&s;t and we&s;t but I went due north all that afternoon with a view to avoid the enemy.</P>
<P>In the evening I began to be very faint, and no wonder; I had been &s;ix days a pri&s;oner; the la&s;t two days of which I had eat nothing, and but very little the fir&s;t three or four: There were wild goo&s;eberries in abundance in the woods, but being unripe required ma&s;tication, which at that time I was not able to perform on account of a blow received from an Indian on the jaw with the back of a tomahawk: There was a weed that grew plentifully in that

place, the juice of which I knew to be grate|ful and nouri&s;hing; I gathered a bundle of the &s;ame, took up my lodging under a large &s;pread|ing beach tree and having &s;ucked plentifully of the juice, went to &s;leep. Next day I made a due ea&s;t cour&s;e which I generally kept the re&s;t of my journey.</P>
<P>I often imagined my gun was only wood bound and tried every method I could devi&s;e to un|&s;crew the lock but never could effect it having no knife nor any thing &s;itting for the purpo&s;e; I had now the &s;atisfaction to find my jaw be|gan to mend and in four or five days could chew any vegetable proper for nouri&s;hment, but finding my gun only a u&s;ele&s;s burden left her in the wilderne&s;s. I had no apparatus for making fire to &s;leep by &s;o that I could get but little re&s;t for the gnats and mu&s;quetoes; there are like|wi&s;e a great many &s;wamps in the beach ridge which occa&s;ioned me very often to lie wet:&mdash;This ridge through which I travelled is about twenty miles broad, the ground in general very there are, however, very few &s;prings, yet wells might ea&s;ily be dug in all parts of that ridge; the timber on it is very lofty, but it is no ea&s;y matter to make a &s;trait cour&s;e through the &s;ame the mo&s;s growing as high upon the &s;outh &s;ide
<PB N="22" REF="048810_0022_102685E07A3179E8">
of the trees as on the north. There are a great many white oaks, a&s;h and hickory trees that grow among the beach timber; there are likewi&s;e &s;ome places on the ridge, perhaps for three or four continued miles where there is little or no beach, and in &s;uch &s;pots, black, white oak, a&s;h, and hickory abound. Sugar trees grow there al&s;o to a very great bulk: The &s;oil is remarkably good, the ground a lit|tle uneven, with &s;ome &s;mall rivulets and a few &s;prings. When I got out of the beach ridge and near the river Mu&s;kingum the lands were more broken but equally as rich; abounding with brooks and &s;prings of water: There are al&s;o &s;everal &s;mall creeks that empty into that riv|er the bed of which is more than a mile wide in many oaks, walnut, hickory and &s;ugar trees in the greate&s;t abundance. In all parts of the country through which I came the game was very plenty, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> deer, turkies and phea&s;ants. I likewi&s;e &s;aw a great many ve&s;tiges of bears and and &s;ome elks.</P>
<P>I cro&s;&s;ed the river Mu&s;kingum about three or four miles below Fort Laurence, and cro&s;&s;ing all the paths aimed for the Ohio river. All his time my food was goo&s;eberries, young net|tles, the juice of herbs, a few &s;ervice berries,
<PB N="23" REF="048810_0023_102685E374CAA600">
and &s;ome May apples, likewi&s;e, two young blackbirds and a turripine which I devoured raw. When my food &s;at heavy on my &s;tomach I u&s;ed to eat a little wild ginger which put all to rights.</P>
<P>I came upon Ohio river about five miles be|low Fort M'Into&s;h in the evening of the 21&s;t, day after I had made my e&s;cape, and on the 22d, about &s;even o'clock in the morning, being the 4th, day of July, arrived &s;afe, though very much fatigued, at the Fort.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT MEMOIR OF THE WITHIN MENTIONED COL. CRAWFORD.</HEAD>
<P>COL. CRAWFORD, was about 50 years of age, had been an old warrior a|gain&s;t the &s;avages. He di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf early as a volunteer in the la&s;t war, and was taken notice of by Col. (now Gen) Wa&s;hing|ton, who procured for him the Commi&s;&s;ion of En&s;ign. As a Parti&s;an he &s;howed him&s;elf very active, and was greatly &s;ucce&s;sful: He took &s;everal Indian towns, and did great &s;ervice in &s;couting, patrolling and defending the fron|tiers. At the commencement of this war he rai&s;ed a regiment in the back country by his own exertions; He had the Commi&s;&s;ion of Col. in the Continental army, and acted brave|ly on &s;everal occa&s;ions in the years '76, '77, and at other times. He held his Commi&s;&s;ion at the time he took command of the militia, in the afore&s;aid expedition again&s;t the Indians; mo&s;t probably he had it with him when he was taken: He was a man of good judgment &s;ingu|lar good nature, great humanity and remark|able for his ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers; no man therefore could be more regretted than the wor|thy and amiable Crawford.</P>
