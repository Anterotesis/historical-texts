<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_HAD the charge of <HI>REBELLION</HI> been made by a private per&s;on again&s;t the colonies on this continent, for their oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Stamp Act,</HI> I &s;hould not have thought it worth an&s;wering.&mdash;But when it was made by men ve&s;ted with a public character, by a committee of corre|&s;pondence, repre&s;enting two branches of legi&s;lature in a con|&s;iderable government, and the charge was not only approved, as it is &s;aid, by tho&s;e branches, but was actually publi&s;hed to the world in news-papers, it &s;eemed to me to de&s;erve notice. I waited &s;ome time, in hopes of &s;eeing the cau&s;e e&s;pou&s;ed by an abler advocate, but being di&s;appointed, I re&s;olved, "favente Deo," to &s;natch a little time from the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, and to place, if I could, the letter of tho&s;e gentlemen to their agent in a proper light.</P>
<P>It is very evident from the <HI>generality</HI> of their accu&s;ation again&s;t their "fellow-&s;ubjects on the northern continent"; of the expre&s;&s;ions they u&s;e in the latter part of their letter, when they &s;peak of the "violent &s;pirit rai&s;ed in the North-American colonies", and from what follows, that they do not apply the approbrious term they u&s;e, only to tho&s;e few of the lower rank, who di&s;turbed us with two or three mobs in &s;ome of the provinces, nor to any other particular cla&s;s of people; but that the cen&s;ure is de&s;igned for <HI>ALL the inha|bitants of the&s;e colonies</HI> who were <HI>any way</HI> concerned in the <HI>oppo&s;ition that has been given,</HI> and con&s;equently that the <HI>modes of that oppo&s;ition</HI> are thereby condemned. Two con&s;iderations therefore have induced me to undertake their
<PB N="ii" REF="010283_0003_0F7E712D1EEF4FC0">
defence. Fir&s;t, to vindicate the honour of my country, which I think gros&s;ly and wantonly in&s;ulted. Secondly, to refute opinions, that in unfortunate times, may, if adopted, be injurious to liberty.</P>
<P>Many good pieces, have been publi&s;hed in the&s;e colonies, to &s;hew their title to the rights claimed by them; the inva&s;ion of tho&s;e rights by the Stamp Act; the other hard|&s;hips impo&s;ed on them, and the bad con&s;equences that probably would follow the&s;e mea&s;ures: but nothing has appeared, at lea&s;t I have &s;een nothing that I recollect, in defence of the <HI>principle</HI> on which the oppo&s;ition has been made, and of the <HI>manner</HI> in which it has been conducted. The&s;e are points entirely new; and the con&s;ideration of them is now rendered nece&s;&s;ary, by the public reproach that has been thrown on the people of this continent.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>A LETTER from the <HI>COMMITTEE</HI> of <HI>CORRES|PONDENCE</HI> in <HI>BARBADOS,</HI> to their <HI>AGENT</HI> in <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the united re&s;olution of the two branches of our legi&s;lature, of which we have &s;e|verally the honor to be members, and to compo&s;e their committee of corre&s;pondence, We are now to de&s;ire you to lay our complaints before his Maje&s;ty and the Parliament, on the hard&s;hips which this community labours under by the impo&s;ition of the Stamp Duties, lately put in force among&s;t us. We have, indeed, &s;ubmitted, with all obedience, to the act of Parliament, yet our <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion</HI> has, by no means, ari&s;en from any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our ability to bear the burden of the&s;e taxes, or from the want of a due &s;en&s;e of the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive weight of them in all its parts,</HI> but
<PB N="iii" REF="010283_0004_0F7E712DDFDFAB00">
from a <HI>principle of loyalty</HI> to our King and Mother Country, which has carried us above every con&s;ide|ration of our own di&s;tre&s;&s;es: yet, if we have &s;uffered without re&s;i&s;tance, we have learnt by it to complain with rea&s;on; and, &s;ince we have rai&s;ed no clamours from our own fears, we mu&s;t &s;urely have the better title to <HI>remon&s;trate from our feelings.</HI> But, with re|&s;pect to the manner in which our grievances in this ca&s;e, along with &s;o good a proof of our <HI>obedience to the laws of our mother country,</HI> are to be reported to his Maje&s;ty and the parliament, we mu&s;t <HI>refer our&s;elves to your good judgment and di&s;cretion</HI>; &s;o much better circum&s;tanced as you are on that &s;ide of the water to judge for us, than we can do at this di&s;tance for our|&s;elves; and &s;o perfectly a&s;&s;ured as we are al&s;o of your ability and zeal, in the conduct of every matter of importance that can be intru&s;ted to your agency for this country's &s;ervice. To you, Sir, therefore we give the power, in the name of our council and a&s;|&s;embly, to pre&s;ent &s;uch a <HI>memorial,</HI> or <HI>memorials,</HI> to his Maje&s;ty, and the two hou&s;es of parliament (if to all be nece&s;&s;ary) as to your&s;elf &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t proper and advi&s;eable; &s;etting forth the anxiety and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our country, under this new and extraordinary burden of taxation, by which we not only find our|&s;elves <HI>loaded with a charge more than is proportioned to our circum&s;tances, but deprived al&s;o of a privilege, which renders the oppre&s;&s;ion beyond mea&s;ure grievous.</HI> We <HI>&s;ee two of the mo&s;t important objects</HI> to &s;uch a colony as ours, <HI>trade and ju&s;tice crouching under the load of the&s;e new duties; and by the manner in which the duties have been impo&s;ed, we find too the mo&s;t valuable of all our civil rights and liberties &s;inking along with them.</HI> The de&s;ign of this new and extraordinary charge upon our country is, towards defraying the expences of defending, protecting and &s;ecuring, the colonies of AMERICA. But what new and extraordinary ex|pence
<PB N="iv" REF="010283_0005_0F7E712E9F339450">
has this colony put the nation to, for the ex|pence of maintaining of troops quartered in the &s;everal provinces of NORTH-AMERICA, for the pro|tection and &s;ecurity of tho&s;e parts of the Briti&s;h dominions? This is ju&s;t as rea&s;onable, and ju&s;t as merciful too, as it would be to impo&s;e a heavy mulct on the inhabitants of this place, by way of a puni&s;h|ment for the pre&s;ent <HI>REBELLIOUS oppo&s;ition given to authority, by our fellow-&s;ubjects on the Northern con|tinent.</HI> But if we are to be <HI>&s;ubject to the power of the parliament of Great-Britain in our internal taxes, we mu&s;t be always liable to impo&s;itions, that have nothing but the will of the impo&s;ers to direct them in the mea&s;ure,</HI> &s;ince we have there no repre&s;entatives to inform them of the true &s;tate of our circum&s;tances, and of the degree of our &s;trength to bear the burdens that are impo&s;ed. How far, indeed, we are intitled, by the con&s;titution of ENGLAND, or our own peculiar <HI>charter,</HI> to an <HI>ex|emption</HI> from every other internal tax, than &s;uch as may be laid upon us by the repre&s;entatives of our own people, in conjunction with the two other branches of our legi&s;lative body, <HI>we cannot po&s;itively &s;ay</HI>; but this is certain, that we have enjoyed that privilege, that <HI>&s;eeming birthright</HI> of every BRITON, ever &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of a civil government in this i&s;land to the pre&s;ent time. And why we &s;hould at this period be condemned to the lo&s;s of &s;o <HI>ine&s;timable a ble&s;&s;ing of &s;ociety,</HI> we can &s;ee no cau&s;e; &s;ince the pre&s;ent period has afforded &s;ome in&s;tances of loyalty and affection to our King and mother country, which might rather have intitled us to new favours from the crown and nation, than have left us expo&s;ed to any deprivation of our <HI>old and valuable rights.</HI> Yet, how far it may be prudent and nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;s this la&s;t con&s;idera|tion in your <HI>memorial</HI> to our &s;uperiors, <HI>mu&s;t be referred to your good judgment</HI>; for as we mean to obtain a redre&s;s of our grievances by a dutiful repre&s;entation
<PB N="v" REF="010283_0006_0F7E712F8C186F80">
only of our ca&s;e, &s;o would we have any thing avoided in the <HI>&s;tile and &s;ub&s;tance of that repre&s;entation,</HI> as might give offence to tho&s;e from whom only our redre&s;s can come, our appeal being to the very powers by whom we think our&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed; tho' we may remon|&s;trate to them with ju&s;tice, <HI>we cannot reproach them without danger</HI>; and the mo&s;t effectual means of giving our&s;elves all the merit we hope for, and intend, both with our &s;overeign and the parliament, will be, we think, by giving our complaint on this matter the <HI>complexion of our conduct,</HI> &s;hewing an <HI>humble &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to authority,</HI> even under the mo&s;t painful <HI>heart-burnings</HI> of our community, at its <HI>&s;evere decrees.</HI> But, great as our di&s;tre&s;&s;es are, upon account of this new Taxation in its general cour&s;e, we are yet fortunate enough not to have &s;uffered &s;o much greater, as by the particular calamity you &s;eem to have apprehended for us, on the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;eizure of the North-American traders; for the ma&s;ters of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, producing certificates at our cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, that no &s;tamp papers were to be had at the ports they came from, have been admitted to an entry of their &s;everal &s;hips and cargoes, being &s;uppo&s;ed only liable to the penalties inflicted by the Stamp Act, and of the&s;e no notice have been taken; &s;o that our danger from the cir|cum&s;tances you &s;ugge&s;ted to the mini&s;ters is over. But we &s;ee another ari&s;ing from the violent &s;pirit rai&s;ed in the North-American colonies again&s;t this act, which threatens us with the &s;ame ill con&s;equences; we mean, from their avowed re&s;entment at the people of this i&s;land, for having &s;o tamely &s;ubmitted to the act, which they had been plea&s;ed &s;o re&s;olutely to op|po&s;e. This having led them to &s;ome extraordinary attempts (as we have been informed) to prevent any ve&s;&s;els coming hither with provi&s;ions for our &s;upport, how far a combination of this kind, which has to &s;truggle with the private intere&s;ts of &s;o many indivi|duals,

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM a <HI>North-American,</HI> and my intention is in addre&s;&s;ing you at pre&s;ent, to an&s;wer &s;o much of a late letter from you to your agent in <HI>London,</HI> as ca&s;ts unmerited cen|&s;ure on my countrymen. After this de|claration, as you entertain &s;uch unfavorable &s;entiments of the "popular fury" on this continent, I pre&s;ume you expect to be treated with all the exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion natural to a rude people. You are mi&s;taken. I am of their opinion, who think it almo&s;t as infamous, to di&s;grace a good cau&s;e by illiberal language, as <HI>to betray it by unmanly timidity.</HI> Complaints may be made with dignity; in&s;ults retorted with decency; and violated rights vindicated without violence of words.</P>
<P>YOU have nothing therefore to apprehend from me, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> but &s;uch reflections on your conduct, as may tend to rou&s;e that remor&s;e in you, which always ari&s;es in the minds of ingenuous per&s;ons, when they find that they have wounded by their ra&s;h calumnies the honor of tho&s;e, who merit their highe&s;t e&s;teem, &mdash;their warme&s;t prai&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="010283_0009_0F7E7132B65AC3B0">I KNOW there are in the i&s;land of <HI>Barbados,</HI> many men of &s;en&s;e, &s;pirit, and virtue, and therefore I chu&s;e to con&s;ider you rather in the character of &s;uch, who&s;e under&s;tanding, re&s;olution, and integrity, have been drugg'd by &s;ome pernicious draught into a &s;lumber, than of tho&s;e, who with irretrievable depravity, want all the qualities requi&s;ite to make them &s;erviceable to their countrymen, or ju&s;t to others.</P>
<P>HAD I only heard, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> that you had called the behavior of the&s;e colonies, a "REBELLIOUS OPPOSITION given to authority," I &s;hould have thought it a vain attempt, to aim at convincing you, how unju&s;tifiable an a&s;per&s;ion that expre&s;&s;ion contained; becau&s;e I &s;hould immediately have concluded, that you were &s;o ignorant of the rights of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubjects, and &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of all concern on the inva&s;ion of tho&s;e rights, that any man who &s;hould endeavour to &s;hew you your error, would engage in as unpromi&s;ing a project, as if he &s;hould think to communicate an idea of &s;ound to the deaf, or of colour to the blind.</P>
<P>WHEN I read your letter, however, with an agreeable &s;urprize I ob&s;erved, that <HI>you,</HI> at the &s;ame time you have made the attack, have laid the foundation of a defence for my countrymen. Permit me to erect the &s;uper|&s;tructure, though I had much rather &s;ee it built by more &s;kilful hands.</P>
<P>YOU acknowledge, the "burthen of the taxes im|po&s;ed by the Stamp Act, to be OPPRESSIVE IN ALL ITS PARTS"; that you are thereby not only "loaded with a charge more than is proportioned to your circum|&s;tances, but DEPRIVED ALSO OF A PRIVILEGE, which renders the OPPRESSION BEYOND MEASURE GRIEVOUS:" that you "&s;ee two of the mo&s;t important objects, TRADE and JUSTICE CROUCHING under the load of the
<PB N="3" REF="010283_0010_0F7E71332A59EB40">
new duties and by the manner in which the&s;e duties have been impo&s;ed, find too the MOST VALUABLE OF ALL YOUR CIVIL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES SINKING ALONG WITH THEM."</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay that if you "are to be &s;ubject to the power of the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> in your internal taxes, you mu&s;t always be liable to impo&s;itions, that have nothing but the WILL OF THE IMPOSERS to direct them in the mea&s;ure." With what con&s;i&s;tency you afterwards he&s;itate, and "cannot &s;ay," whether the pri|vilege of taxing your&s;elves, exclu&s;ively belongs to you, or talk of a "SEEMING <HI>birthright,</HI>" I will leave to be determined by your&s;elves, or the agent to who&s;e "good judgment and di&s;cretion," you with &s;uch &s;trange, I had almo&s;t &s;aid "humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion" "refer" your mo&s;t im|portant affairs. However, your &s;entiments &s;oon veer about again, and you &s;peak of "AN INESTIMABLE BLESSING OF SOCIETY;" of "OLD AND VALUABLE RIGHTS, and even hazard the hardy appellation of "SEVERE DECREES."</P>
<P>WHEN it is &s;o evident, that all the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are equally true with regard to your&s;elves, and "your fellow-&s;ubjects on the northern continent," it affords no &s;light cau&s;e of amazement, to &s;ee in the &s;ame letter that contains the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, the oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e confe&s;&s;edly de&s;tructive mea&s;ures, branded as "REBEL|LIOUS". Wherefore this needle&s;s &s;troke again&s;t your "fellow-&s;ubjects?" Could not your "principle of loy|alty" &s;ink you to a &s;atisfactory depth of humiliation, unle&s;s you flung your&s;elves down with &s;uch a rage of pro&s;tration as to &s;patter all around you? Was not your &s;urrender of "<HI>the mo&s;t valuable of all rights and liberties</HI>" &s;ufficiently completed by your declaration, that you "COULD NOT POSITIVELY SAY <HI>you were intitled to them,</HI>" without reproaching tho&s;e who have the mi&s;|fortune
<PB N="4" REF="010283_0011_0F7E7133DC176418">
of differing &s;o widely from you in their &s;entiments, that they had rather die than make &s;uch a declaration?</P>
<P>TO talk of your "charter" <HI>gentlemen,</HI> on this oc|ca&s;ion, is but weakening the cau&s;e by relying on fal&s;e aids. Your opinion on this head &s;eems to be borrowed from the doctrine of the unhappy <HI>Stuarts.</HI> They thought, or pretended to think, all the liberties of the &s;ubject were mere favours granted by charters from the crown. Of con&s;equence, all claims of liberties not ex|pre&s;ly mentioned in tho&s;e charters, were regarded as in|va&s;ions of the prerogative, which according to them, was a power ve&s;ted in the prince, they could not tell how, for no better purpo&s;e, than to do as he plea&s;ed. But what &s;aid the nation? They a&s;&s;erted, that the royal charters were <HI>declarations</HI> but not <HI>gifts</HI> of liberties, made as oc|ca&s;ions required, on tho&s;e points in which they were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, without enumerating the re&s;t; and that the prerogative was a power ve&s;ted in <HI>one</HI> for the benefit of <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>KINGS or parliaments could not <HI>give</HI> the <HI>rights e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s,</HI> as you confe&s;s tho&s;e invaded by the Stamp Act to be. We claim them from a higher &s;ource&mdash;from the King of kings, and Lord of all the earth. They are not annexed to us by parchments and &s;eals. They are created in us by the decrees of Providence, which e&s;tabli&s;h the laws of our nature. They are born with us; exi&s;t with us; and cannot be taken from us by any human power, without taking our lives. In &s;hort, they are founded on the immu|table maxims of rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. It would be an in&s;ult on the divine Maje&s;ty to &s;ay, that he has given or allowed any man or body of men a <HI>right to make me mi&s;erable.</HI> If no man or body of men has <HI>&s;uch a rights,</HI> I have a <HI>right to be happy.</HI> If there can be no hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="5" REF="010283_0012_0F7E7136A0EE7F08">
without freedom, I have a <HI>right to be free.</HI> If I cannot enjoy freedom without &s;ecurity of property, I have a <HI>right to be thus &s;ecured.</HI> If my property cannot be &s;ecure, in ca&s;e others over whom I have no kind of influence, may take it from me by taxes, under pre|tence of the public good, and for enforcing their de|mands, may &s;ubject me to arbitrary, expen&s;ive, and remote juri&s;dictions, I have an <HI>exclu&s;ive right</HI> to lay taxes on my own property, either by my&s;elf or tho&s;e I can tru&s;t; of nece&s;&s;ity to judge in &s;uch in&s;tances of the public good; and to be exempt from &s;uch juri&s;dictions. &mdash;But no man can be &s;ecure in his property, who is "liable to <HI>impo&s;itions,</HI> that have NOTHING BUT THE WILL OF THE IMPOSERS to direct them in the mea&s;ure;" and that make "JUSTICE TO CROUCH UNDER THEIR LOAD."</P>
<P>THUS you prove, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> that the fatal act you allude to in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, is de&s;tructive of our property, our freedom, our happine&s;s: that it is in|con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and ju&s;tice; and &s;ubver&s;ive of tho&s;e &s;acred rights which GOD him&s;elf from the infinity of his benevolence has be&s;towed upon mankind.</P>
<P>YET after the&s;e expre&s;&s;ed or implied conce&s;&s;ions, you term the oppo&s;ition made by my countrymen to the execution of this&mdash;imagination cannot &s;upply me with an epithet equal to my meaning&mdash;act, "REBEL|LIOUS."</P>
<P>PRAY, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> let me not mi&s;take your notion of "humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to authority." Do you main|tain, that becau&s;e the parliament may legally make <HI>&s;ome</HI> laws to bind us, it therefore may legally make <HI>any</HI> laws to bind us? Do you a&s;&s;ert, that where power is con&s;titutionally ve&s;ted in particular per&s;ons for certain purpo&s;es, the &s;ame obedience is due to the commands
<PB N="6" REF="010283_0013_0F7E71376FA8BAB8">
of tho&s;e per&s;ons, when they exceed the limits of that power, as when they are re&s;trained within them? Do you &s;ay, that all acts of authority are &s;anctified by the mere plea&s;ure of their authors, and that "humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion" is due to them, however injurious they may be to tho&s;e over whom they are exerci&s;ed&mdash;or that the oppre&s;&s;ed ought to content them&s;elves with "giving the COMPLEXION of your CONDUCT" to PALE petitions&mdash; and that <HI>all other</HI> oppo&s;ition is "rebellious?"</P>
<P>GREATLY I am afraid, that you have publi&s;hed to the world too convincing proofs, that you hold the&s;e &s;entiments: &s;entiments, which I &s;olemnly profe&s;s are &s;o horrible to me, that I cannot wi&s;h the infection of them even to the bittere&s;t enemies of my country.</P>
<P>HAVE you con&s;idered, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> the importance of the points to which your political creed may be appli|ed? What is your opinion of the <HI>revolution,</HI> that made the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> liberty and <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> glory blaze out with their brighte&s;t lu&s;tre?

<P>IT is as manife&s;t, that the great and good men who then placed the throne in the temple of liberty, di&s;|dained your &s;entiments, as it is, that if they had ap|proved them, you would not at pre&s;ent enjoy the &s;a|tisfaction of being ruled by a prince who&s;e virtues do honour to his rank.

<P>LET me &s;peak plainly. In &s;uch a cau&s;e to prevari|cate or fear, is wor&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, than fal&s;hood or cowardi&s;e. Good breeding in private life, or good behavior in public life, can never require a deviation from truth or virtue. Our obligation to the&s;e, is co|exi&s;tent with us, and unchangeable. No other relation therefore can di&s;&s;olve or dimini&s;h the primary, un|alterable duty.</P>
<P>DO you believe, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> that parliaments never did, or never will do wrong? Do you profe&s;s an in|fallibility in politics, which you ridicule in religion? If any man &s;hould tell the pre&s;ent parliament, they are all-wi&s;e and all-perfect, I am per&s;uaded, it would be e&s;teemed a wretched in&s;ult both on their under&s;tand|ing and piety. Say they are the wi&s;e&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t a&s;|&s;embly on earth; and you &s;ay right. But human wi&s;|dom and human ju&s;tice partake of human frailties. Such is the lot of our nature&mdash;and to be&s;tow the attributes of heaven on mortals, who to day are, and to-morrow are not, is the wildne&s;s of adulation.</P>
<P>SURELY, you cannot per&s;evere in your error.

If a fortune of immen&s;e value comes into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by being &s;ettled on me, as the lawful &s;on of my father, which till then had been held &s;olely by him, and my enemies &s;hould per&s;uade my excellent parent to attempt to ba&s;tardize me, and take the whole into his hands again, I not having the lea&s;t pro&s;|pect of happine&s;s without it, and he not having the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for it&mdash;&s;hould I be undutiful, if after endeavoring by intreaties to prevent his proceedings, I carefully record all the proofs of my being legitimate, &s;top the circulation of all fal&s;e vouchers to the contrary, decline the corre&s;pondence of tho&s;e who join with him, and even break the head of a man, who &s;landers my honour and my title, by &s;preading an opinion that I am ba&s;ely born? With how much le&s;s rea&s;on will the charge of undutifulne&s;s be made again&s;t me, if I have regularly advanced for my father all &s;uch &s;ums as he has from time to time required, and have a&s;&s;ured him by my profe&s;&s;ions and behavior, that he &s;hall have all the profits of the e&s;tate, allowing me a comfortable

maintenance, if he will &s;uffer it to continue in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;and all the world knows, that by a con|dition annexed to this e&s;tate, I cannot part with it, without acknowledging my&s;elf to be a ba&s;tard.</P>
<P>TO conclude&mdash;<HI>gentlemen</HI>&mdash;I know none of you; not even one of your names. I mean no per&s;onal reflecti|ons in this addre&s;s. I dete&s;t them. If you &s;hould take any thing I have &s;aid, &s;o much in that way, as to feel unea&s;ine&s;s from it, I &s;hall be very &s;orry. Neither do I intend any reflections on your country, tho you repre&s;ented <HI>her</HI> when you attacked <HI>mine.</HI> I always de|te&s;ted the&s;e loo&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, that ever give mo&s;t pain to bo&s;oms that honour and delicacy have rendered mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible; and this dete&s;tation has been greatly encrea&s;ed, &s;ince, within the&s;e few years, we have &s;een &s;uch loads of obloquy thrown upon a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Scots.</NOTE> nation, who&s;e magnani|mity in bearing them will be &s;ufficient I hope, to pro|cure them the e&s;teem of tho&s;e, who have been &s;o much blinded by pa&s;&s;ion, as to deny it to their other nume|rous virtues and accompli&s;hments. Your i&s;land is re|&s;pectable. Your private characters may be amiable: but in a public capacity, you have ca&s;t a mo&s;t high and unprovoked cen&s;ure on a gallant, generous, loyal people. You have propagated a &s;et of &s;entiments, and have promoted a tenor of conduct, that may be hurtful to the cau&s;e of freedom. I have engaged with too unequal arms perhaps, to oppo&s;e you; but to <HI>fail</HI> in &s;uch a conte&s;t, will afford me &s;ome kind of plea&s;ure. I wi&s;h you every ble&s;&s;ing that men can enjoy; and as a foundation and &s;ecurity of all the re&s;t, I wi&s;h you a true love of liberty.</P>
