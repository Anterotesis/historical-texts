<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE character in which you have late|ly appeared to the world, as <HI>Pre&s;ident of the Grand Continental Congre&s;s,</HI> has placed you in &s;o eminent a point of view, that, like a city &s;et on a hill, you cannot be <HI>hid:</HI> Your name, till of late, known compa|ratively to but few, out of your own province, now holds rank with other Chieftains in the Ame|rican cau&s;e, and is, of cour&s;e, in the mouth of every politician, that is, of every man, woman and child, throughout the extended continent of Engli&s;h America; we all, gentle and &s;imple, old and young, bond and free, male and female, fancy our&s;elves connected with you by a politi|cal relation, which entitles us to the mo&s;t per|fect liberty of &s;peech, to you and of you, when|&s;oever we think the cau&s;e requires it. You will not then be &s;urpri&s;ed at finding your&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> ad|dre&s;&s;ed

by a <HI>&s;tranger,</HI> and through a <HI>news-paper,</HI> the common channel of conveyance for <HI>modern</HI> addre&s;&s;es to Governors, Generals and Kings. What your <HI>private,</HI> political &s;entiments are, I know not, nor do I conceive the knowledge of them to be material to any but <HI>your&s;elf;</HI> it is in|deed whi&s;pered, that <HI>Mr. Randolph</HI> is very far from approving of many things adopted by <HI>Peyton Randolph, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Pre&s;ident of the Congre&s;s;</HI> if this were a truth, well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and univer&s;ally known, <HI>Mr. Randolph,</HI> and the <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> would have very different &s;ets of men for their ad|mirers: But this may be all fal&s;e conjecture, which you will lay to the account of an unavoid|able tax upon the <HI>great.</HI> Talked of you mu&s;t be; and it would be &s;trange indeed, if &s;ome er|rors did not creep into the judgments, and &s;ome fal&s;hoods &s;hoot from the lips of three millions of politicians, endowed with the gift of tongues.</P>
<P>Leaving therefore your private &s;entiments to your&s;elf, until I am better acquainted with them, I &s;hall, in the corre&s;pondence, which I have now the honour to open, addre&s;s my&s;elf to you, as <HI>Pre&s;ident of the American Congre&s;s, begun and held at Philadelphia, Sept.</HI> 5<HI>th,</HI> 1774. I do not in|tend to take the liberty of modern addre&s;&s;ers to Sovereigns, and their Repre&s;entatives, in load|ing you with &s;currility and abu&s;e, where I find rea&s;on and argument to be wanting; but, on the contrary, it is my determination to reverence yours and my own characters as Gentlemen, and to &s;ay nothing whereby I may wound the one, or forfeit the other. At the &s;ame time it is my fixed purpo&s;e, to deliver my own &s;entiments with the freedom of an Engli&s;hman, nearly inte|re&s;ted
<PB N="5" REF="014094_0004_0F92DD6F8A1D91B0">
in the important &s;ubjects upon which they are formed. If the freedom of the pre&s;s is not denied me, I propo&s;e in a cour&s;e of letters, as health and lei&s;ure &s;hall permit, to lay before you, without re&s;erve, my thoughts on your Bill of Rights, your Li&s;t of Grievances, your adoption of the Suffolk Re&s;olves, your letter to his Ex|cellency General Gage, your A&s;&s;ociation, and your three very &s;ingular Addre&s;&s;es; and to point out to you, the fatal con&s;equences of which they have already been productive in this province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay; and the &s;till more fatal ef|fects, there is rea&s;on to fear, they will produce to the whole Engli&s;h America. If, in the pro&s;e|cution of this plan, I &s;hall pre&s;erve decency and good manners, notwith&s;tanding we may differ very widely in our notions, I pre&s;ume my free|dom of di&s;qui&s;ition upon the mea&s;ures &s;ubmitted to the judgement of every individual, by being expo&s;ed to the public eye, will give no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence. We are all embarked in one bottom; my life, and the lives of my wife and children, my property, my all, &s;tand mo&s;t inti|mately connected with the lo&s;s or &s;afety of the &s;hip&mdash;the &s;torm is violent; you, Mr. Pre&s;ident, have undertaken to pilot her through, to the much wi&s;hed for haven of peace,&mdash;you have taken the helm, and under your direction &s;he is now going at a great rate; but the tempe&s;t in|crea&s;es, the heavens lour, the clouds thicken and blacken every moment, the hoar&s;e thunder very &s;en&s;ibly approaches nearer and nearer,&mdash;the bil|lows break on every &s;ide,&mdash;and to compleat the di&s;mal pro&s;pect, the &s;hip is too cra&s;y to afford
<PB N="6" REF="014094_0005_0F92DD7056404DE8">
hopes of riding out the &s;torm,&mdash;and the man|ners are upon the point of mutiny.</P>
<P>If amid&s;t all the&s;e circum&s;tances of extreme danger, you, through want of &s;kill in naviga|tion, or from being unacquainted with the coa&s;t, or from any other cau&s;e, have run us among rocks, &s;hoals, and quick&s;ands, far di&s;tant from our de&s;ired port, you will, mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly ble&s;s the man, who &s;ea&s;onably points them out, tho' they may have been fir&s;t di&s;covered by a <HI>common eye;</HI> an eye, in all other in&s;tances, much inferior to your own: perhaps it is not yet too late to retrieve our errors; there is a po&s;&s;ibility that by adopting different mea&s;ures, and pur&s;uing an op|po&s;ite cour&s;e, we may yet be &s;aved: and while there is a po&s;&s;ibility, it is excu&s;able, it is an in|cumbent duty on every one freely to give his opinion. And on the other hand, if <HI>our</HI> appre|hen&s;ions of danger (for I am not alone) are ill-founded, and our fears proceed from ignorance, and too great caution, &s;till the intere&s;t we have to ri&s;k, will plead our excu&s;e with you; and you will kindly compo&s;e our ruffled &s;pirits, by gently explaining our &s;ituation, and pointing out to us our mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>Without confining my&s;elf to the foregoing or|der of the &s;ubject, upon which I intend to treat, I will conclude this addre&s;s, with &s;ome remarks upon your letter to General Gage the cau&s;es which lead to it, and the effects it has produced.</P>
<P>In your fir&s;t letter, you premi&s;e that, <Q>the inha|bitants of the town of Bo&s;ton had <HI>informed</HI> you, that the fortifications erecting within that town, the frequent inva&s;ions of private property, and the repeated in&s;ults they received from the &s;ol|diery

<P>Upon this, give me leave to ob&s;erve, that the profe&s;&s;ed <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of your <HI>appointment</HI> which was to <HI>deliberate</HI> upon, and <HI>propo&s;e</HI> to your <HI>con&s;tituents,</HI> the be&s;t means for re&s;toring <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>harmony</HI> between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her <HI>Colonies;</HI> the vio|lent inflammation to which you knew the pa&s;|&s;ions of the people were then rai&s;ed; the venera|tion with which you knew they looked up to your body, however <HI>uncon&s;titutional,</HI> and void of <HI>legal</HI> power and authority, it might be; the thorough knowledge, which, from General Gage's long re|&s;idence on the continent, you mu&s;t many of you, have had of his wi&s;dom, prudence, hu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ity, and

love of ju&s;tice; the&s;e all, I &s;ay, were weighty con&s;iderations, which &s;hould have induced you to the greate&s;t circum&s;pection, and caution in re|ceiving complaints, and adopting <HI>&s;u&s;picions,</HI> to the prejudice of &s;o good a character, in &s;timulat|ing to acts of rebellion, a people already too much di&s;po&s;ed blindly to ru&s;h into it; and thereby de|feating the &s;ole valuable purpo&s;e of your a&s;&s;em|bling. But the complaints upon which your letter was founded, were &s;o entirely repugnant to the well known truth of facts, that, had a letter appeared in print charging the Congre&s;s with the open breach of the whole decalogue, it could not have occa&s;ioned more a&s;toni&s;hment among your members, than that with which yours filled the minds of all in and about Bo&s;|ton. It is inconceivable how you could be &s;o ig|norant of the &s;ituation of things here at that time. The Suffolk re&s;olves, unhappily, you had &s;een, and (pardon the expre&s;&s;ion) in a paroxi&s;m of epidemic madne&s;s, you had, fatally adopted. The&s;e, when cool reflection took place, told you, as plainly as if written with a &s;un-beam, or pro|claimed in thunder from a Sinai, that the voice of that leading county, as delivered by their de|legates, was for war. Previous to this four thou&s;and people had a&s;&s;embled at Cambridge, &s;ome in arms, and others having lodged their arms at a trifling di&s;tance, o&s;ten&s;ibly to enquire into the cau&s;e of grievances, but in reality, to prevent, by force, the execution of acts of parlia|ment. The tran&s;actions of that day I need not recapitulate; they were not done in a corner, but in the face of open day, with an eclat which mu&s;t have penetrated the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of
<PB N="9" REF="014094_0008_0F92DD7287DB0450">
the mo&s;t ob&s;cure corner of Briti&s;h America. Be|fore and after this, the de&s;ign of a de&s;cent from the country, for the purpo&s;e of attacking the &s;mall number of his Maje&s;ty's troops, then &s;ta|tioned at Bo&s;ton, was publicly talked of, with an a&s;&s;urance which would have forced belief upon the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate &s;ceptic. Major Paddock's field pieces, with other cannon, were &s;ecretly taken away, and conveyed into the country. Powder, ball, flints, and &s;mall arms, were pur|cha&s;ed with unu&s;ual avidity&mdash;and a number of a&s;&s;ailants, who were to make the attack, was publicly and univer&s;ally &s;et at thirty-thou&s;and. A Colonel Putnam, of Connecticut, with a zeal, not according to knowledge, alarmed that, and all the &s;outhern provinces, and the whole coun|try was in motion. Under all the&s;e ho&s;tile ap|pearances, what was it the duty of a good Ge|neral to do? Was it not to &s;ecure his troops in the be&s;t manner he could again&s;t the threatened inva&s;ion? This his Excellency General Gage did, by repairing the old fortifications at the en|trance into the town, and by throwing up an in|trenchment &s;till further from the town, on each &s;ide of the common road The&s;e works were, manife&s;tly not offen&s;ive, again&s;t either town or country, but merely defen&s;ive, again&s;t invaders; as every man, upon &s;ight of them, mu&s;t at once perceive, if he can di&s;tingui&s;h the breech from the mouth of the cannon. Be&s;ides the&s;e works, there was at that time a train of artillery in Bo&s;|ton; they were placed at the bottom of the com|mon, pointing, as is u&s;ual, towards the front of the encampment, which was on the &s;ide of the common, next to the town; this circum|&s;tance
<PB N="10" REF="014094_0009_0F92DD735FBB17B8">
the inhabitants, in a late town-meeting, have alledged as an in&s;tance of the General's want of attention, when in his conde&s;cending an&s;wer to your letter, he &s;aid, <Q>not a &s;ingle cannon is pointed again&s;t the town.</Q> This is &s;upporting their complaint by a mi&s;erable quibble; I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, it implies nothing wor&s;e. I have been told, that one &s;agacious gentleman ob&s;erved with great warmth, that it was &s;trictly true, <Q>that every cannon on the neck was point|ed again&s;t the town, becau&s;e the bounds of the town extended half a mile beyond the lines,</Q> though let it be ob&s;erved, there are but two hou&s;es in that &s;pace&mdash;this likewi&s;e is a circum&s;tance, to which, I am per&s;uaded, the Ge|neral did not advert. By this kind of logic, if his Excellency had been charged with pointing his cannon again&s;t heaven; and it had happened that one of them had, at any time, been elevated more than forty-five degrees, this would have &s;upported the charge. The inva&s;ion of private property, charged upon the General, was equal|ly novel and &s;trange here, with the complaint re&s;pecting the fortifications; the only colourable pretext for it, that I know or have ever heard of, if this can be termed colourable, is the &s;eiz|ing &s;everal pieces of cannon, not by the Gene|ral, but by the commander of one of his Maje&s;|ty's &s;hips, for being water-borne; they were in|tended to be &s;muggled into the country; but whether they were private property or not, is unknown, as they were condemned in the Court of Admiralty, for want of a claimant. I have heard mention made of the orders re&s;pecting the merchants powder, as another in&s;tance of this
<PB N="11" REF="014094_0010_0F92DD7409F34590">
kind; it is very true before the defen&s;ive works at the neck were fini&s;hed, and while the threats of an inva&s;ion were warm, the General did, for a &s;hort time, very wi&s;ely and prudently prohibit the keeper of the magazine from delivering out any powder&mdash;but this is, at mo&s;t, only in the na|ture of an embargo, and is no more an inva&s;ion of private property than an embargo on &s;hips is. The&s;e are all the pretended in&s;tances I have ever heard hinted at, in &s;upport of this part of the complaint. The &s;ugge&s;tion of the irregularity of the &s;oldiers is truly a&s;toni&s;hing; it is noto|rious, and it is acknowledged by every one out of town-meeting, that the regularity and decent, inoffen&s;ive behaviour has been remarkably con|&s;picuous. The town has in&s;tanced only in the affair of one gentleman's hor&s;e; and this I be|lieve happened &s;ince the date of your letter; but by what rule of ju&s;tice does a &s;ingle in&s;tance in an individual, &s;upport a general charge again&s;t the whole body of the &s;oldiers? Would it be ju&s;t to call the town of Bo&s;ton a den of thieves, becau&s;e one or two of the inhabitants have been guilty of theft? In &s;hort, Mr. Pre&s;ident, it is truth too glaring to be que&s;tioned, that his Ex|cellency the General, has con&s;tantly given the &s;tricte&s;t orders, and attended with the mo&s;t watch|ful eye, for the pre&s;ervation of peace and good order, in con&s;equence of which the good di&s;ci|pline and regular behaviour of the &s;oldiery has been without a parallel. Such is the &s;andy foun|dation, upon which you have adopted and pub|li&s;hed to this people, &s;u&s;picions of a plan to overthrow the liberties of America; upon which you have admoni&s;hed General Gage, in the &s;tile
<PB N="12" REF="014094_0011_0F92DD74D1DCE428">
of a Roman Emperor, to the governor of a pro|vince; hoping that he would di&s;continue the fortifications; which he mu&s;t have done at the price of his character and commi&s;&s;ions, if not of his head; that he would re&s;train the irregulari|ties of the &s;oldiers; which had been uniformly re&s;trained almo&s;t to a miracle; and that he would give orders for opening the communication be|tween the town and the country, which had ne|ver been interrupted, but had been con&s;tantly kept open, unmole&s;ted and free, for all his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects to pa&s;s and repa&s;s, about their lawful bu&s;ine&s;s; as every town&s;man and coun|tryman, who had occa&s;ion to make the attempt, can abundantly te&s;tify. The con&s;equence of your publi&s;hing to the world your mi&s;conceived opinions and cen&s;ures, were the injuring a mo&s;t amiable and worthy character, with tho&s;e who&s;e remote di&s;tance from Bo&s;ton, deprived them of the means of knowing the truth, re&s;pecting the General's conduct; a character of which I would here with plea&s;ure attempt a portrait, but that I know would offend the delicacy of his &s;entiments; increa&s;ing groundle&s;s fears and jealou&s;ies in the minds of the people; and &s;timulating them to take up arms again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's troops; for though this might be far from your intention, yet your authority over their pa&s;&s;ions was &s;uch, that your letter &s;erved to give &s;anction to th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e mad, violent mea&s;ures, to which they were be|fore but too much inclined. The&s;e were the evil effects of this ha&s;ty mea&s;ure; and I mention them, not becau&s;e I take plea&s;ure in a fruitle&s;s recrimination; but becau&s;e I think it of the la&s;t importance that the people &s;hould be undeceived;

and becau&s;e you may po&s;&s;ibly hereafter have it in your power, by retracting and rectifying your pa&s;t errors, to prevent their future ill effects, and thereby, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, attone for them. I am, Sir, with perfect good will, your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t, I did my&s;elf the honour to addre&s;s you, on the &s;ubject of your letter to his Ex|cellency General Gage, to point out to you the real &s;ituation of things here, previous to, and at the time of your taking that incon&s;iderate &s;tep, and the mi&s;chievous effects it produced in this di&s;tracted province. I now proceed, with the &s;ame decent freedom, to animadvert upon &s;ome other of your mea&s;ures, equally imprudent and impolitic in their nature, and pernicious in their con&s;equences. If the &s;eeming har&s;hne&s;s of the&s;e, and other terms, which in the cour&s;e of my cor|re&s;pondence, may drop from my pen, &s;hould kindle any momentary re&s;entment in your brea&s;t, you will remember, it is an inhabitant of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay who addre&s;&s;ed you, not in your private, but in your public character. There are few men who can, with perfect calm|ne&s;s and impartiality, hear their own &s;entiments and conduct arraigned and condemned; but you have &s;tiled your&s;elf my repre&s;entative, and there|by have given me a right to examine, approve or di&s;approve of your proceedings in that capa|city; the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this deduction, is &s;o &s;elf evident&mdash;it is &s;o clearly implied in the fir&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="014094_0013_0F92DD7731132410">
principles of repre&s;entation among &s;ocial crea|tures and moral agents, that while you keep it in view, it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould be di&s;gu&s;ted at any thing I have &s;aid, or intend to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to make any further ob&s;er|vations on your mea&s;ures, give me leave to lay before you, my idea of the de&s;ign of your ap|pointment, and what in con&s;equence thereof, it was your duty to do, and what not to do.</P>
<P>For &s;ome con&s;iderable time before the &s;cheme of a grand congre&s;s was adopted, the minds of the good people of this continent in general, and of this province in particular, were mo&s;t violent|ly agitated, their tempers ruffled, and their pa&s;|&s;ions inflamed; jealou&s;y, the rage of man, had taken fa&s;t hold on them&mdash;they had been repeat|edly told and always too credulous, they believ|ed, that plans were formed and pro&s;ecuting, for depriving them of their rights as Engli&s;hmen, and reducing them to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery: With the&s;e fatal prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they had been hurried on, in a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;tic frenzy, to an undi&s;gui&s;ed, violent oppo&s;ition, to the &s;u|preme authority over the whole Briti&s;h empire; an authority, which, from the fir&s;t moment of their political exi&s;tence, they had uniformly re|cognized; upon which, as upon a firm ba&s;is all their charter rights were founded, and which had ever been their defence and &s;upport; and to a &s;avage inva&s;ion of private right and private pro|perty, which neither the laws of God or man could warrant or countenance; and &s;uch were the popular Rabbies, that lawle&s;s anarchy, and violence, threatened &s;peedily to de&s;olate this once happy land. On the other hand, the parliament,

<P>I have already mentioned the ho&s;tile appear|ance, and the high-handed, riotous proceedings, which took place at Cambridge, on the &s;econd of September: After which, on the &s;ixth of the &s;ame month, were pa&s;&s;ed the memorable re&s;olves of the Delegates for the county of Suffolk: Re|&s;olves which, from my &s;oul I wi&s;h could be buried in eternal oblivion; but this is impo&s;&s;ible; for, unhappily, in the plenitude of popular fren|zy, they were publi&s;hed to the whole world.

You may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf the per|&s;on who now addre&s;&s;es you, takes no plea&s;ure in le&s;&s;ening your weight and authority with your con&s;tituents, any farther than as he conceives it a nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;aving them from total de|&s;truction. The expediency, the nece&s;&s;ity of ex|po&s;ing the errors of your conduct to the people, ri&s;eth in proportion to the &s;anguine confidence they have placed in your &s;uppo&s;ed infallibility. This overweening confidence of the many, in the unerring wi&s;dom and incorruptible integrity of the few, who have taken the lead in turbulent times, has been the fatal &s;ource from whence has &s;prang all the tyranny, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal, under which mankind have groaned. That the greater part of tho&s;e whom you have under|taken to repre&s;ent, relied mo&s;t implicitly on your virtue and abilities, to point out the way in which they ought to go, you will not he&s;itate to believe and acknowledge, that the path which you have encouraged and directed them to pur|&s;ue, is the broad way which leadeth to de&s;truc|tion, is what I mo&s;t religiou&s;ly believe; and if I

<P>To proceed: In a pamphlet, entitled, "Ex|tracts from the votes and proceedings of the American continental congre&s;s," &amp;c. &s;aid to be publi&s;hed by order of the congre&s;s, I find, among other matters, &s;undry re&s;olves, pa&s;&s;ed from time to time; the fir&s;t of which carries &s;o much of the &s;pirit and likene&s;s of that on the Suffolk re|&s;olves, which was the &s;ubject of my la&s;t addre&s;s, that I cannot but believe they are twins, both conceived and brought forth, at the &s;ame point of time. In this it is re&s;olved, "That this Con|gre&s;s do approve of the oppo&s;ition made by the inhabitants of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, to the exe|cution of the late acts of parliament; and if the &s;ame &s;hall be attempted to be carried into exe|cution by force, in &s;uch ca&s;e all America ought to &s;upport them in their oppo&s;ition." What! Mr. Pre&s;ident,&mdash;was it wi&s;dom,&mdash;was it pru|dence&mdash;was it &s;ound policy&mdash;was it humanity, to approve of high trea&s;on and rebellion, com|mitted by a part of your ignorant, deluded, un|happy con&s;tituents? For &s;urely your a&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed, in &s;o great a mea&s;ure, of gentlemen,
<PB N="22" REF="014094_0021_0F92DD8029517038">
who had made the law their &s;tudy and profe&s;&s;ion, could not be ignorant that the forceable oppo&s;i|tion made to the execution of the laws at Cam|bridge, and in other parts of this province; and the riotous a&s;&s;emblies for the redre&s;s of public grievances, amounted indi&s;putably to high-trea|&s;on: Every writer on crown law, and on the &s;ta|tute of trea&s;ons, is &s;o clear and explicit on this point, that it leaves no room for decency or charity to &s;uppo&s;e, that lawyers or &s;tate&s;men could doubt it. Certainly, your a&s;&s;embling from all parts of the continent, for the dreadful pur|po&s;e of encouraging and adopting the highe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;tructive of all &s;tate crimes, was but a poor expence of time and money; this you might have done and tarried at home: Things could not have been wor&s;e, had none pretended to take the helm, but every man been left to do what was right in his own eyes. Had you, Mr. Pre&s;ident, frowned upon the&s;e violent and very dangerous proceedings; pointed out their certain tendency to defeat the good purpo&s;es of your meeting:&mdash;to provoke, beyond the limits of pa|tience, the re&s;entment of an in&s;ulted parent &s;tate; to involve the province in the horrors of an un|equal, civil war;&mdash;to expo&s;e the ra&s;h perpetra|tors to inevitable de&s;truction, both in per&s;on and property;&mdash;had you exhorted them, by all they held dear and &s;acred, to refrain immediately from every thing which carried the remote&s;t appear|ance of trea&s;on, rebellion, mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, riots, barbarous in&s;ults, and abu&s;e of individu|als;&mdash;had you, I &s;ay, taken this wi&s;e, humane cour&s;e, you might have been the happy means of &s;aving thou&s;ands from mi&s;eries, which, it is

But in&s;tead of this, when you &s;ee the dogs of civil war let &s;lip, you cry, havock!&mdash;and, as if not content with &s;o confined a &s;cene of horror and de&s;olation, as a &s;ingle province could afford, you endeavoured to &s;pirit up all America, to &s;upport them in their oppo&s;ition: With this view, you &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e, which either then really exi&s;ted, or el&s;e might never happen; for you &s;ay, "if the &s;ame (acts of parliament) &s;hall be attempted to be carried into execution by force."&mdash;What kind of force did you here intend? You knew a fleet of &s;hips lay in Bo&s;ton harbour, to attempt to carry one act of parliament into execution by force; you knew that General Gage, with a number of regi|ments were &s;ent hither to &s;upport the civil ma|gi&s;trate, in the execution of other acts of parlia|ment; but neither of the&s;e can be the force you intend, becau&s;e you &s;uppo&s;e an attempt not then made: What other or further force had you any rea&s;on to expect would be attempted? And why would you, at that critical moment hold up to a blindly enraged people, a ca&s;e which exi&s;ted then only in vague imagination, and which, po&s;&s;ibly, and mo&s;t probably, would never be realized? How much more amiable would you have ap|peared in the eyes of all good men, how much more con&s;i&s;tent would you have acted with the character of mediators, aiming at the re&s;toration of peace and good will between the mother-coun|try and her colonies, if you had, by advi&s;ing to a gentle, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate behaviour, cooled the over|heated pa&s;&s;ions of the multitude, and reduced

them to &s;uch a calm, moderate temper, as would have qualified them for a &s;ucce&s;sful negociation?

Such an expli|cit, &s;udden approbation from the Grand Conti|nental Congre&s;s, had all the effect upon the minds of the infatuated people here, that an au|dible voice from heaven would have had; and even tho&s;e who, with &s;ome remains of con&s;idera|tion, looked back with trembling upon the &s;teps they had but lately trod, now no longer que&s;|tioned the propriety of their conduct; and no|thing but the wi&s;dom, prudence and humanity of the commander in chief, &s;aved us from being precipitately plunged into remedile&s;s ruin.

It really &s;eems as if in&s;tead of guiding and directing the continent, you were your&s;elves guided and directed by town and county meetings in this province, from whom you &s;eem to have copied all your mea|sures.&mdash;Your bill of rights, and your li&s;t of grievances, differ but little, in form or &s;ub&s;tance, from the re&s;olves of mo&s;t of our county town meetings; and though they contain &s;ome things which at another time would be unexception|able, yet, every circum&s;tance concurred to ren|der &s;uch declarations from you, at that time, al|together improper.&mdash;Your only proper bu&s;ine&s;s was to devi&s;e an expedient for bringing the par|ties together, and had you recommended pay|ment for the tea, and the appointment of agents

But to quit trope and figure, you fir&s;t &s;tile your&s;elves, in this curious in&s;trument, the ASSOCIATION, his Maje&s;ty's MOST loyal &s;ubjects; avowing your allegiance to his Maje&s;ty, and your affection and regard for your fellow-&s;ubjects in Great-Britain, and el&s;ewhere:&mdash;This, Mr. Pre&s;ident, &s;ounds well; and happy had it been for you, thrice happy for tho&s;e, who&s;e Delegates you call your&s;elves, if you had continued in this loyal, affectionate, regardful temper and &s;train: But, to the grief of all loyal, good and virtuous, by whom you were delegated, if you may be &s;aid to be delegated by any &s;uch, you no &s;ooner make this o&s;tentatious declaration, than you immediately throw off all appearance of loyalty to your Sovereign, of affection and regard for your fellow-&s;ubjects in Great-Britain, or el&s;ewhere, and open a plan of rebellion again&s;t your Sovereign, calculated to di&s;tre&s;s, and in your declared opinion, to &s;tarve your fellow-&s;ubjects in Great-Britain, Ireland, and the We&s;t-Indies, at the manife&s;t hazard and ri&s;que of the total de&s;truction of all your fellow-subjects el&s;ewhere; that is, on the whole continent of America. Such is your loyalty to your King, &s;uch your affec|tion and regard for your fellow-&s;ubjects, as they are to be col|lected from your &s;ub&s;equent actions, the &s;ure&s;t di&s;coveries of the real intentions of the human heart: You next proceed, in con|formity to the apparent, general plan of your mea&s;ures, to irri|tate the parliament of Great-Britain, and to inflame the raging pa&s;&s;ions of your American fellow-&s;ubjects, by holding up &s;undry &s;tatutes as grievances, and placing them in a point of view, which, by no means, &s;hews them in their genuine colours: You repre&s;ent the late act of parliament, impo&s;ing a three-penny duty on tea, as part of a &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery, adopted by the Britain Mi|ni&s;try, about the year 1763, and the only rea&s;on you a&s;&s;ign for this repre&s;entation is, that it is an act for rai&s;ing a revenue in America; whereas you knew, or might and ought to have known, that if any &s;uch plan was ever laid, it was &s;o long ago as the year 1660, when the tobacco act was pa&s;&s;ed, which was for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue upon the trade of the colonies. You knew, I pre&s;ume, that in the year 1672, a duty was laid by act of parliament, upon all <Q>white, brown and mu&s;covado &s;ugars, to|bacco, cotton wool, indigo, ginger, logwood, fu&s;tic, and other dying wood, and cocoa nuts &s;hipped in any of the plantations, to be carried to any other plantation, the &s;aid duties to be le|vied, collected and paid, in the re&s;pective plantations before the &s;hipping thereof,</Q> and this, you mu&s;t know, was rai&s;ing a revenue in America. You knew of the act pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame year, 1672, granting a duty <Q>on all train oil, and whale fin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">,

taken in &s;hipping belonging to any of the colonies and plan|tations, and imported into England.</Q> You could not be ignorant of the act pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ixth year of George the &s;econd, impo&s;ing a duty <Q>on all foreign rum, &s;pirits, mela&s;&s;es, &s;ugar and paneles, imported into any of the colonies, to be rai&s;ed, le|vied, collected and paid, unto and for the u&s;e of his Maje&s;ty, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,</Q>&mdash;and this too you mu&s;t know, was rai&s;ing a revenue in America.&mdash;You could not forget that above &s;ixty years ago, in the ninth year of the reign of Queen Ann, an act was made for <Q>e&s;tabli&s;hing a general po&s;t-office in Great-Britain, the We&s;t-Indies, and on the continent of North-A|merica,</Q> and that one rea&s;on therein a&s;&s;igned for pa&s;&s;ing it, was, <Q>that the revenue ari&s;ing thereby might be better im|proved, &s;ettled and &s;ecured to her Maje&s;ty.</Q>&mdash;Of the&s;e, and many other acts of parliament, &s;imilar in form and e&s;&s;ect, pa&s;&s;ed in every reign for more than an hundred years pa&s;t, I dare not affront the wi&s;dom of the congre&s;s by &s;uppo&s;ing them ignorant; how then could you repre&s;ent the tea act, to your delegators, as being pa&s;&s;ed in pro&s;ecution of a &s;y&s;tem adopted in 1763? Is not this a palpable mi&s;repre&s;entation? And even upon the &s;avage plan of goading the people on to rebellion, can mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion be ju&s;tified? Was it wi&s;e, was it politic, was it benevo|lent, was it loyal to your King, or affectionate to your fellow-&s;ubjects, thus to wrong the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration, and to &s;ti|mulate the coloni&s;ts to a forfeiture of life and e&s;tate, by holding up as a novelty of modern invention, what you knew was e&s;tab|li&s;hed by ancient and continual practice? To the&s;e que&s;tions, I leave you, Mr. Pre&s;ident, to give an an&s;wer, which I cannot give without pain; and yet, this is the grand foundation, &s;o far as re&s;pects all the colonies, excepting Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, upon which you ground as ASSOCIATION, which your po&s;terity will read with that mixture of a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;hame, which we feel at reflecting on the inju&s;tice of our fore-fathers, in the time of &s;uppo&s;ed witchcraft. God, I hope has forgiven them&mdash;they &s;aw their errors and repented. You, I hope, will have the &s;ame plea, and find the &s;ame mercy.</P>
<P>I might ea&s;ily go on to &s;hew that the two general acts which you repre&s;ent as grievances, on account of their novelty, are &s;up|ported by ancient precedents, and con&s;equently can be no part of a &s;y&s;tem adopted in 1763; you need only look into the &s;ta|tutes to be fully convinced of this; nor can either of them be viewed as part of a &s;y&s;tem of American &s;lavery, becau&s;e they equal|ly affect all the inhabitants of England, Scotland and Ireland, the West-Indies; neither is it po&s;&s;ible you could in your con&s;ciences

How then, Sir, could you thus at|tempt to make blind eyes blinder, to make the mad Americans rage, and the deceived people imagine vain things? How could you thus &s;et your&s;elves and take coun&s;el together again&s;t the Lord's anointed; &s;timulating the inhabitants of this continent to wage war with their parents, and rebel, again&s;t their lawful Sovereign, after declaring your&s;elves his mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects, and avowing an affection and regard for all your fellow-&s;ubjects? How, I a&s;k, could you adopt and recommend &s;uch infatuated mea&s;ures, upon &s;o &s;andy a foundation? Yet, this you have done, to the a&s;toni&s;hment and grief of all good men: You have for your&s;elves, and your delegators, a&s;&s;ociated and agreed to break off all commerce, trade and dealing with your fellow-&s;ubjects of Great-Britain, Ireland, and the Briti&s;h plantations, and this with a profe&s;&s;ed intent to procure a repeal of certain acts of the Briti&s;h parliament, the laws of King George the Third,&mdash;that King, who&s;e mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects, you, by a &s;trange perver&s;ion of language, profe&s;s your&s;elves to be: Surely you could not &s;up|po&s;e this a healing mea&s;ure, tending to an accommodation of our unhappy differences; you mu&s;t know your preamble was calculated to blind the rea&s;on, and inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of Ame|ricans, and your a&s;&s;ociation an open act of ho&s;tility, which could not fail to &s;harpen the re&s;entment of an affronted, powerful nation, jealous of their rights, and tender of their honour: You mu&s;t know, this baneful mea&s;ure, tended with inevitable certainty, to the introduction of civil war, and all its train of intolerable mi&s;eries; how could you thus &s;teel your hearts again&s;t every &s;entiment of loyalty and humanity!

It is &s;trange indeed, that wi&s;e men &s;hould hit upon trea&s;on and rebellion, as the means of pacifying an offended Sovereign; and upon vio|lence and robbery, as the pre&s;ervatives of civil liberty: How much more certainly would the tendency of a gentle, peaceable, orderly conduct, have been to obtain the&s;e de&s;irable ends!&mdash;But one part &s;till remains, equally ab&s;urd and amazing with any thing I have yet mentioned, which is this; among the acts, the repeal of which you make the condition of your cea&s;ing ho&s;ti|lities, is that "for extending the limits of Quebec, &amp;c." What an in&s;ult upon your Sovereign! What an affront to the &s;upreme authority of the Briti&s;h empire! What had you to do with Que|bec? You never pretended to be delegated by that province; did you, in the plenitude of your fancied power, imagine your|&s;elves the Lords Paramount of ALL America? It really looks, Sir, as if you feared, le&s;t your other requi&s;itions &s;hould be com|plyed with, and thereby all pretence for rebellion, war and anarchy be taken away. It looks as if the bottom of your &s;cheme was an independent republic, and that this condition was thrown in, effectually to prevent that accommodation, which would defeat your favourite plan; for you mu&s;t know this could never be complied with: There is no part of your mea|&s;ures, at which charity is &s;o aba&s;hed and confounded, when with her wonted good-nature, &s;he would fain &s;uppo&s;e you meant well, general frenzy and <HI>dementia</HI> of the times.&mdash;Here, &s;he pau&s;es, blu&s;hes, looks down and is &s;ilent.</P>
