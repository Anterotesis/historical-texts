<P>"WHEN once &s;ordid intere&s;t &s;eizes on the heart, it freezes up the &s;ource of every warm and liberal feeling; it is an enemy alike to virtue and to ta&s;te&mdash;<HI>this</HI> it perverts, and <HI>that</HI> it annihilates. The time may come, my friend, when death &s;hall di&s;&s;olve the &s;inews of avarice, and ju&s;tice be per|mitted to re&s;ume her rights."</P>
<P>Such were the words of the Advocate Nemours to Pierre de la Motte, as the latter &s;tept at midnight into the carriage which was to bear him far from Paris, from his creditors and the per&s;ecution of the laws. De la Motte thanked him for this la&s;t in&s;tance of his kindne&s;s; the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had given him in e&s;cape; and, when the carriage drove away, uttered a &s;ad adieu! The gloom of the hour, and the peculiar emergency of his circum&s;tances, &s;unk him in &s;ilent reverie.</P>
<P>Whoever has read Guyot de Pitavel, the mo&s;t faithful of tho&s;e writers who record the proceedings in the Parliamentary Courts of Paris, during the &s;eventeenth century, mu&s;t &s;urely, remember the &s;triking &s;tory of Pierre de la Motte, and the Marquis Phillipe de Montalt: let all &s;uch therefore, be informed, that the per&s;on here introduced to their notice was that indi|vidual Pierre de la Motte.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="029379_0003_0FE0891E2FAE3CE0">As Madame de la Motte leaned from the coach window, and gave a la&s;t look to the walls of Paris&mdash;Paris, the &s;cene of her former happine&s;s, and the re&s;idence of many dear friends&mdash; the fortitude, which had till now &s;upported her, yielded to the force of grief. "Farewell all!" &s;ighed &s;he, "this la&s;t look and we are &s;eparated for ever!" Tears followed her words, and, &s;inking back, &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to the &s;tillne&s;s of &s;orrow. The recollection of former times pre&s;&s;ed heavily upon her heart: a few months before and &s;he was &s;urrounded by friends, for|tune, and con&s;equence; now &s;he was deprived of all, a mi&s;era|ble exile from her native place, without home, without com|fort&mdash;almo&s;t without hope. It was not the lea&s;t of her afflictions, that &s;he had been obliged to quit Paris, without bidding adieu to her only &s;on, who was now on duty with his regiment in Germany&punc; and &s;uch had been the precipitancy of this removal, that had &s;he even known where he was &s;tationed, &s;he had no time to inform him of it, or of the alteration in his father's circum&s;tance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Pierre de la Motte was a gentleman, de&s;cended from an ancient hou&s;e of France. He was a man who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rcame his rea&s;on, and, for a time, &s;ilenced his con&s;cience; but, though the image of virtue, which Nature had impre&s;&s;ed upon his heart, was &s;ometimes ob&s;cured by the pa&s;&s;ing influ|ence of vice, it was never wholly obliterated. With &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient to have with&s;tood temptation, he would have been a good man; as it was, he was always a weak, and &s;ometimes a vicious member of &s;ociety: yet his mind was active, and his imagination vivid, which, co-operating with the force of pa&s;&s;ion, often dazzled his judgment and &s;ubdued principle. Thus he was a man, infirm in purpo&s;e and vi&s;ionary in virtue: in a word, his conduct was &s;ugge&s;ted by feeling, rather than principle; and his virtue, &s;uch as it was, could not &s;tand the pre&s;&s;ure of occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Early in life he had married Con&s;tance Valentia, a beauti|ful and elegant woman, attached to her family, and beloved by them. Her birth was equal, her fortune &s;uperior to his; and their nuptials had been celebrated under the au&s;pices of an ap|proving and flattering world. Her heart was devoted to La Motte, and, for &s;ome time, &s;he found in him an affectionate hu&s;band; but allured by the gaieties of Paris, he was &s;oon devot|ed to its luxuries, and in a few years his fortune and affection were equally lo&s;t in di&s;&s;ipation. A fal&s;e pride had &s;till ope|rated again&s;t his intere&s;t, and withheld him from honourable
<PB N="5" REF="029379_0003_0FE0891E2FAE3CE0">
retreat while it was yet in his power: the habits, which he had acquired, enchained him to the &s;cene of his former plea&s;|ure; and thus he had continued an expen&s;ive &s;tile of life till the means of prolonging it were exhau&s;ted. He at length awoke from his lethargy of &s;ecurity; but it was only to plunge into new error, and to attempt &s;chemes for the repara|tion of his fortune, which &s;erved to &s;ink him deeper in de&s;|truction. The con&s;equence of a tran&s;action, in which he thus engaged, now drove him with the &s;mall wreck of his property, into dangerous and ignominious exile.</P>
<P>It was his de&s;ign to pa&s;s into one of the Southern Provin|ces, and there &s;eek, near the borders of the kingdom, an a&s;ylum in &s;ome ob&s;cure village. His family con&s;i&s;ted of his wife, and two faithful dome&s;tics, a man and woman, who followed the fortunes of their ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The night was dark and tempe&s;tuous, and, at about the di&s;tance of three leagues from Paris, Peter, who now acted as po&s;tillion, having drove for &s;ome time over a wild heath where many ways cro&s;&s;ed, &s;topped, and acquainted De la Motte with his perplexity. The &s;udden &s;topping of the carriage rou&s;ed the latter from his reverie, and filled the whole party with the terror of pur&s;uit; he was unable to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ary direc|tion, and the extreme darkne&s;s made it dangerous to proceed without one. During this period of di&s;tre&s;s, a light was perceived at &s;ome di&s;tance, and after much doubt and he&s;ita|tion, La Motte, in the hope of obtaining a&s;&s;i&s;tance, alighted and advanced towards it; he proceeded &s;lowly, from the fear of unknown pits. The light i&s;&s;ued from the window of a &s;mall and ancient hou&s;e, which &s;tood alone on the heath, at the di&s;tance of half a mile.</P>
<P>Having reached the door, he &s;topped for &s;ome moments, li&s;tening in apprehen&s;ive anxiety&mdash;no &s;ound was heard but that of the wind, which &s;wept in hollow gu&s;ts over the wa&s;te. At length he ventured to knock, and, having waited &s;ome time, during which he indi&s;tinctly heard &s;everal voices in con|ver&s;ation, &s;ome one within enquired what he wanted? La Motte an&s;wered, that he was a traveller who had lo&s;t his way, and de&s;ired to be directed to the neare&s;t town. "That," &s;aid the per&s;on, "is &s;even miles off and the road bad enough, even if you could &s;ee it: if you only want a bed, you may have it here, and had better &s;tay."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="029379_0004_0FE089296C08B868">The "pitile&s;s pelting" of the &s;torm, which at this time, beat with encrea&s;ing fury upon La Motte, inclined him to give up the attempt of proceeding farther till day-light; but de&s;irous of &s;eeing the per&s;on with whom he conver&s;ed, before he ventured to expo&s;e his family by calling up the carriage, he a&s;ked to be admitted. The door was now opened by a tall figure with a light, who invited La Motte to enter. He followed the man through a pa&s;&s;age into a room almo&s;t un|furni&s;hed, in one corner of which a bed was &s;pread upon the floor. The forlorn and de&s;olate a&s;pect of this apartment made La Motte &s;hrink involuntarily, and he was turning to go out, when the man &s;uddenly pu&s;hed him back, and he heard the door locked upon him: his heart failed, yet he made a de&s;pe|rate, though vain, effort to force the door, and called loudly for relea&s;e. No an&s;wer was returned; but he di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices of men in the room above, and, not doubting but their intention was to rob and murder him, his agitation, at fir&s;t, overcame his rea&s;on. By the light of &s;ome almo&s;t ex|piring embers, he perceived a window, but the hope, which this di&s;covery, revived, was quickly lo&s;t, when he found the aperture guarded by &s;trong iron bars. Such preparation for &s;ecurity &s;urpri&s;ed him, and confirmed his wor&s;t apprehen&s;ions. Alone, unarmed&mdash;beyond the chance of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he &s;aw him&s;elf in the power of people, who&s;e trade was apparently rapine!&mdash;murder their means!&mdash;After revolving every po&s;&s;i|bility of e&s;cape, he endeavoured to await the event with for|titude; but La Motte could boa&s;t of no &s;uch virtue.</P>
<P>The voices had cea&s;ed, and all remained &s;till for a quarter of an hour, when, between the pau&s;es of the wind he thought he di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;obs and moaning of a female; he li&s;tened attentively and became confirmed in his conjecture; it was too evidently the accent of di&s;tre&s;s. At this conviction, the re|mains of his courage for&s;ook him, and a terrible &s;urmi&s;e darted, with the rapidity of lightning, cro&s;s his brain. It was probable that his carriage had been di&s;covered by the peo|ple of the hou&s;e, who, with a de&s;ign of plunder, had &s;ecured his &s;ervant, and brought hither Mademe de la Motte. He was the more inclined to believe this, by the &s;tillne&s;s which had, for &s;ome time, reigned in the hou&s;e, previous to the &s;ound he now heard. Or it was po&s;&s;ible that the inhabitants were not robbers, but per&s;ons to whom he had been betrayed by his friend or &s;ervant, and who were appointed to deliver him into the hands of ju&s;tice. Yet he hardly da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to doubt
<PB N="7" REF="029379_0004_0FE089296C08B868">
the integrity of his friend, who had been entru&s;ted with the &s;ecret of his flight and the plan of his route, and had procured him the carriage in which he had e&s;caped. "Such depravity," exclaimed La Motte, "cannot &s;urely exi&s;t in human nature; much le&s;s in the heart of Nemours!"</P>
<P>This ejaculation was interrupted by a noi&s;e in the pa&s;&s;age leading to the room: it approached&mdash;the door was unlocked &mdash;and the man who had admitted La Motte into the hou&s;e; entered leading, or rather forcibly dragging along, a beautiful girl, who appeared to be about eighteen. Her features were bathed in tears, and &s;he &s;eemed to &s;uffer the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, The man fa&s;tened the lock and put the key in his pocket. He then advanced to La Motte, who had before ob&s;erved other per&s;ons in the pa&s;&s;age, and pointed a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, "You are wholly in our power," &s;aid he, "no a&s;&s;i&s;tance can reach you: if you wi&s;h to &s;ave your life, &s;wear that you will convey this girl where I may never &s;ee her more; or rather con&s;ent to take her with you, for your oath I would not be|lieve, and I can take care you &s;hall not find me again.&mdash;An&s;wer quickly, you have no time to lo&s;e."</P>
<P>He now &s;eized the trembling hand of the girl, who &s;hrunk agha&s;t with terror, and hurried her towards La Motte, whom &s;urpri&s;e &s;till kept &s;ilent. She &s;unk at his feet, and with &s;up|plicating eyes, that &s;treamed with tears, implored him to have pity on her. Notwith&s;tanding his pre&s;ent agitation, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to contemplate the beauty and di&s;tre&s;s of the ob|ject before him with indifference. Her youth, her apparent innocence&mdash;the artle&s;s energy of her manner forcibly a&s;&s;ailed his heart, and he was going to &s;peak, when the ruffian, who mi&s;took the &s;ilence of a&s;toni&s;hment for that of he&s;itation, pre|vented him. "I have a hor&s;e ready to take you from hence," &s;aid he, "and I will direct you over the heath. If you return within an hour, you die: after then you are at liber|ty to come here when you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>La Motte, without an&s;wering, rai&s;ed the lovely girl from the floor, and was &s;o much relieved from his own apprehen|&s;ions, that he had lei&s;ure to attempt di&s;&s;ipating hers. "Let us be gone," &s;aid the ruffian, "and have no more of this non&s;en&s;e; you may think your&s;elf well off it's no wor&s;e. I'll go and get the hor&s;e ready."</P>
<P>The la&s;t words rou&s;ed La Motte, and perplexed him with new fears; he dreaded to di&s;cover his carriage, lo&s;t its ap|pearance might tempt the banditti to plunder; and to depart
<PB N="8" REF="029379_0005_0FE0892F0A64F320">
on hor&s;eback with this man might produce a con&s;equence yet more to be dreaded. Madame La Motte, wearied with apprehen&s;ion, would, probably, &s;end for her hu&s;band to the hou&s;e, when all the former danger would be incurred, with the additional evil of being &s;eparated from his family, and the chance of being detected by the emi&s;&s;aries of ju&s;tice in endeavouring to recover them. As the&s;e reflections pa&s;&s;ed over his mind in tumultuous rapidity, a noi&s;e was again heard in the pa&s;&s;age, an uproar and &s;cuffle en&s;ued, and in the &s;ame mo|ment he could di&s;tingui&s;h the voice of his &s;ervant, who had been &s;ent by Madame La Motte in &s;earch of him. Being now determined to di&s;clo&s;e what could not long be concealed, he exclaimed aloud that a hor&s;e was unnece&s;&s;ary, that he had a carriage at &s;ome di&s;tance which would convey them from the heath, the man, who was &s;eized, being his &s;ervant.</P>
<P>The ruffian, &s;peaking through the door, bid him be patient awhile and he &s;hould hear more from him. La Motte now turned his eyes upon his unfortunate companion, who, pale and exhau&s;ted, leaned for &s;upport again&s;t the wall. Her features, which were delicately beautiful, had gained from di&s;tre&s;s an expre&s;&s;ion of captivating &s;weetne&s;s: &s;he had
<Q><L>"An eye</L>
<L>"As whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the blue &s;ky trembles thro' a cloud</L>
<L>"Of pure&s;t white."</L></Q>
A habit of grey camlet, with &s;hort &s;la&s;hed &s;leeves, &s;hewed, but did not adorn, her figure: it was thrown open at the bo|&s;om, upon which part of her, hair had fallen in di&s;order, while the light veil ha&s;tily thrown on, had, in her confu&s;ion, been &s;uffered to fall back. Every moment of farther ob&s;ervation heightened the &s;urpri&s;e of La Motte, and intere&s;ted him more warmly in her favour. Such eleg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and apparent refinement, contra&s;ted with the de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lation of the hou&s;e, and the &s;avage manners of its inhabitants, &s;eemed to him like a romance of imagination, rather than an occurrence of real life. He en|deavoured to comfort her, and his &s;en&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion was too &s;incere to be mi&s;under&s;tood. Her terror gradually &s;ub&s;ided into gratitude and grief. "Ah, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "Heaven has &s;ent you to my relief, and will &s;urely reward you for your protection: I have no friend in the world, if I do not find one in you."</P>
<P>La Motte a&s;&s;ured her of his kindne&s;s, when he was inter|rupted by the entrance of the ruffian. He de&s;ired to be conducted to his family. "All in good time," replied the latter; "I
<PB N="9" REF="029379_0005_0FE0892F0A64F320">
have taken care of one of them, and will of you, plea&s;e St. Peter; &s;o be comforted." The&s;e <HI>comfortable</HI> words renewed the terror of La Motte, who now earne&s;tly begged to know if his family were &s;afe. "O! as for that matter they are &s;afe enough and you will be with them pre&s;ently; but don't &s;tand <HI>parlying</HI> here all night Do you chu&s;e to go or &s;tay? You know the conditions." They now bound the eyes of La Motte and of the young lady, whom terror had hitherto kept &s;ilent, and then placing them on two hor&s;es, a man mounted behind each, and they immediately galloped off. They had proceeded in this was near half an hour, when La Motte entreated to know whither he was going? "You will know that bye and bye," &s;aid the ruffian, "&s;o be at peace." Finding inter|rogatories u&s;ele&s;s, La Motte re&s;umed &s;ilence till the hor&s;es &s;top|ped. His conductor then hallooed, and being an&s;wered by voices at &s;ome di&s;tance, in a few moments the &s;ound of carriage wheels was heard, and, pre&s;ently after, the words of a man directing Peter which way to drive. As the carriage ap|proached, La Motte called, and to his inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, was an&s;wered by his wife.</P>
<P>"You are now beyond the borders of the heath, and may go which way you will," &s;aid the ruffian; "if you return within an hour, "you will be welcomed by a brace of bullets." This was a very unnece&s;&s;ary caution to La Motte, whom they now relea&s;ed. The young &s;tranger &s;ighed deeply, as &s;he entered the carriage; and the ruffian, having be&s;towed upon Peter &s;ome directions and more threats, waited to &s;ee him drive off. They did not wait long.</P>
<P>La Motte immediately gave a &s;hort relation of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the hou&s;e, including an account of the manner in which the young &s;tranger had been introduced to him. Du|ring this narrative, her deep convul&s;ive &s;ighs frequently drew the attention of Madame La Motte, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion became gradually intere&s;ted in her behalf, and who now endeavoured to tranquillize her &s;pirits. The unhappy girl an&s;wered her kindne&s;s in articles and &s;imple expre&s;&s;ions, and then relap&s;ed into tears and &s;ilence. Madame forbore for the pre&s;ent to a&s;k any que&s;tions that night lead to a di&s;covery of her connections, or &s;eem to require an explanation of the late adventure, which now furni&s;hing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with a new &s;ubject of reflection, the &s;en&s;e of her own misfortunes pre&s;&s;ed le&s;s heavily upon her mind. The di&s;tre&s;s of La Motte was even for a while &s;u&s;pended; he ruminated on the late &s;cene, and it appeared like a vi&s;ion, or
<PB N="10" REF="029379_0006_0FE0893E04FB48A8">
one of tho&s;e improbable fictions that &s;ometimes are exhibited in a romance: he could reduce it to no principles of proba|bility, or render it comprehen&s;ible by any endeavour to ana|lize it. The pre&s;ent charge, and the chance of future trouble brought upon him or this adventure, occa&s;ioned &s;ome di&s;&s;at|isfaction; but the beauty and &s;eeming innocence of Adeline, united with the pleadings of humanity in her favour, and he determined to protect her.</P>
<P>The tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of emotions which had pa&s;&s;ed in the bo&s;om of Adeline, beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ub&s;ide; terror was &s;oftened into anxiety, and de&s;pair into grief. The &s;ympathy &s;o evident in the manners of her companions, particularly in tho&s;e of Madame La Motte, &s;oothed her heart and encouraged her to hope for better days.</P>
<P>Di&s;mally and &s;ilently the night pa&s;&s;ed on, for the minds of the travellers were too much occupied by their &s;everal &s;uffer|ings to admit of conver&s;ation. The dawn &s;o anxiou&s;ly watched for, at length appeared and introduced the &s;trangers more fully to each other. Adeline derived comfort from the looks of Madame La Motte, who gazed frequently and attentively at her, and thought &s;he had &s;eldom &s;een a countenance &s;o inter|e&s;ting, or a form &s;o &s;triking. The languor of &s;orrow threw a melancholy grace upon her features, that appealed immedi|ately to the heart; and there was a penetrating &s;weetne&s;s in her blue eyes, which indicated an intelligent and amiable mind.</P>
<P>La Motte now looked anxiou&s;ly from the coach window, that he might judge of their &s;ituation, and ob&s;erve whether he was followed. The ob&s;curity of the dawn confined his views, but no per&s;on appeared. The &s;un at length tinted the ea&s;tern clouds and the tops of the highe&s;t hills, and &s;oon after bur&s;t in full &s;plendour on the &s;cene. The terror of La Motte began to &s;ub&s;ide, and the griefs of Adeline to &s;often. They entered upon a lane confined by high banks and over-arched by trees, on who&s;e branches appeared the fir&s;t green buds of &s;pring glittering with dews. The fre&s;h breeze of the morning ani|mated the &s;pirits of Adeline, who&s;e mind was delicately &s;en&s;i|ble to the beauties of nature. As &s;he viewed the flowery luxuriance of the turf, and the tender green of the trees, or caught, between the opening banks, a glimp&s;e of the varied land&s;cape, rich with wood, and fading into the blue and di&s;|tant mountains, her heart expanded in momentary joy. With Adeline the charms of external nature were heightened by tho&s;e of novelty: &s;he had &s;eldom &s;een the grandeur of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ten&s;ive
<PB N="11" REF="029379_0006_0FE0893E04FB48A8">
pro&s;pect, or the magnificence of a wide horrizon&mdash;and not often the picture&s;que beauties of more confined &s;cenery. Her mind had not lo&s;t by long oppre&s;&s;ion that ela&s;tic energy, which re&s;i&s;ts calamity; el&s;e, however &s;u&s;ceptible might have been her original ta&s;te, the beauties of nature would no longer have charmed her thus ea&s;ily even to temporary repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The road at length, wound down the &s;ide of a hill, and La Motte, again looking anxiou&s;ly from the window, &s;aw be|fore him an open champaign country, through which the road, wholly un&s;heltered from ob&s;ervation, extended almo&s;t in a di|rect line. The danger of the&s;e circum&s;tances alarmed him, for his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight might without difficulty be traced for many leagues from the hills he was now de&s;cending. Of the fir&s;t pea&s;ant that pa&s;&s;ed, he enquired for a road among the hills, but heard of none. La Motte now &s;unk into his former ter|rors. Madame, notwith&s;tanding her own apprehen&s;ions, en|deavoured to re-a&s;&s;ure him, but finding her efforts ineffectual, &s;he al&s;o retired to the contemplation of her misfortunes. Of|ten, as they went on, did La Motte look back upon the coun|try they had pa&s;&s;ed, and often did imagination &s;ugge&s;t to him the &s;ounds of di&s;tant pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>The travellers &s;topped to breakfa&s;t in a village, where the road was at length ob&s;cured by woods, and La Motte's &s;pir|its again revived. Adeline appeared more tranquil than &s;he had yet been, and La Motte now a&s;ked for an explanation of the &s;cene he had witne&s;&s;ed on the preceeding night. The in|quiry renewed all her di&s;tre&s;s, and with tears &s;he entreated for the pre&s;ent to be &s;pared on the &s;ubject. La Motte pre&s;&s;ed it no farther, but he ob&s;erved that for the greater part of the day &s;he &s;eemed to remember it in melancholy and dejection. They now travelled among the hills and were, therefore, in le&s;s dan|ger of ob&s;ervation; but La Motte avoided the great towns, and &s;topped in ob&s;cure ones, no longer than to refre&s;h the hor&s;es. About two hours after noon, the road wound into a deep valley, watered by a rivulet, and over-hung with wood. La Motte called to Peter, and ordered him to drive to a thickly embowered &s;pot, that appeared on the left. Here he alighted with his family, and Peter having &s;pread the provi&s;ions on the turf, they &s;eated them&s;elves and partook of the repa&s;t, which, in other circum&s;tances, would have been thought delicious. Adeline endeavoured to &s;mile, but the languor of grief was now heightened by indi&s;po&s;ition. The violent agitation of mind, and fatigue of body, which &s;he had &s;uffered for the
<PB N="12" REF="029379_0007_0FE089429CE1D068">
la&s;t twenty-four hours, had overpowered her &s;trength, and, when La Motte led her back to the carriage, her whole frame trembled with illne&s;s. But &s;he uttered no complaint, and, having long ob&s;erved the dejection of her companions, &s;he made a feeble effort to enliven them.</P>
<P>They continued to travel throughout the day without any accident or interruption, and, about three hours after &s;un&s;et, arrived at Monville, a &s;mall town where La Motte determined to pa&s;s the night. Repo&s;e was, indeed nece&s;&s;ary to the whole party, who&s;e pale and haggered looks, as they alighted from the carriage, were but too obvious to pa&s;s unob&s;erved by the people of the inn. As &s;oon as the beds could be prepared Adeline withdrew to her chamber, accompanied by Madam La Motte, who&s;e concern for the fair &s;tranger made her exert every effort to &s;oothe and con&s;ole her. Adeline wept in &s;ilence, and taking the hand of Madame, pre&s;&s;ed it to her bo&s;om. The&s;e were not merely tears of grief&mdash;they were mingled with tho&s;e which flow from the grateful heart, when unex|pectedly, it meets with &s;ympathy. Madame La Motte under|&s;tood them. After &s;ome momentary &s;ilence &s;he renewed her a&s;&s;urances of kindne&s;s, and entreated Adeline to confide in her friend&s;hip; but &s;he carefully avoided any mention of the &s;ubject, which had before &s;o much affected her. Adeline at length found words to expre&s;s her &s;en&s;e of this goodne&s;s, which &s;he did in a manner &s;o natural and &s;incere, that Madame, find|ing her&s;elf much affected, took leave of her for the night.</P>
<P>In the Morning, La Motte ro&s;e at an early hour, impa|tient to be gone. Every thing was prepared for his departure, and the breakfa&s;t had been waiting &s;ome time, but Adeline did not appear. Madame La Motte went to her chamber, and found her &s;unk in a di&s;turbed &s;lumber. Her breathing was &s;hort and irregular&mdash;&s;he frequently &s;tarted, or &s;ighed, and &s;ometimes &s;he muttered an incoherent &s;entence. While Ma|dame gazed with concern upon her languid countenance, &s;he awoke, and looking up, gave her hand to Madame La Motte, who found it burning with fever. She had pa&s;&s;ed a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tle&s;s night and as &s;he now attempted to ri&s;e, her head which beat with inten&s;e pain, grew giddy, her &s;trength &s;ailed, and &s;he &s;unk back.</P>
<P>Madame was much alarmed, being at once convinced that it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could travel, and that a delay m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prove fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er hu&s;band. She went to inform him of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> truth, and his di&s;tre&s;s may be more ea&s;ily imagined than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;cribed.
<PB N="13" REF="029379_0007_0FE089429CE1D068">
He &s;aw all the inconvenience and danger of delay, yet he could not &s;o far dive&s;t him&s;elf of humanity, as to aban|don Adeline to the care, or rather to the neglect of &s;trangers. He &s;ent immediately for a phy&s;ician, who pronounced her to be in a high fever, and &s;aid, a removal in her pre&s;ent &s;tate mu&s;t be fatal. La Motte now determined to wait the event, and endeavoured to calm the tran&s;ports of terror, which at times, a&s;&s;ailed him. In the mean while he took &s;uch pre|cautions as his &s;ituation admitted of, pa&s;&s;ing the greater part of the day out of the village, in a &s;pot from whence he had a view of the road for &s;ome di&s;tance; yet to be expo&s;ed to de|&s;truction by the illne&s;s of a girl, whom he did not know, and who had actually been forced upon him, was a misfortune, to which La Motte had not philo&s;ophy enough to &s;ubmit with compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Adeline's fever continued to encrea&s;e during the whole day, and at night, when the phy&s;ician took his leave, he told La Motte, the event would very &s;oon be decided. La Motte re|ceived this intelligence with real concern. The beauty and innocence of Adeline had overcome the di&s;advantageous cir|cum&s;tances under which &s;he had been introduced to him, and he now gave le&s;s con&s;ideration to the inconvenience &s;he might hereafter occa&s;ion him, than to the hope of her recovery.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte watched over her with tender anxiety, and ob&s;erved with admiration her patient &s;weetne&s;s and mild re&s;ignation. Adeline amply rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id her, though &s;he thought &s;he could not. "Young as I am," &s;he would &s;ay "and de|&s;erted by tho&s;e upon whom I have a claim for protection, I can remember no connection to make me regret life &s;o much as that I hoped to form with you. If I live, my conduct will be&s;t expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of your goodne&s;s;&mdash;words are but feeble te&s;timonies."</P>
<P>The &s;weetne&s;s of her manners &s;o much attracted Madame La Motte, that &s;he watched the cri&s;is of her di&s;order, with a &s;olicitude which precluded every other intere&s;t. Adeline pa&s;|&s;ed a very di&s;turbed night, and when the phy&s;ician appeared in the morning, he gave orders that &s;he &s;hould be indulged with whatever &s;he liked, and an&s;wered the inquiries of La Motte with a frankne&s;s that left him nothing to hope.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his patient, after drinking profu&s;ely of &s;ome mild liquids, fell a&s;leep, in which &s;he continued for &s;everal hours, and &s;o profound was her ropo&s;e, that her breath
<PB N="14" REF="029379_0008_0FE08867F5235908">
alone gave &s;ign of exi&s;tence. She awoke free from fever and with no other di&s;order than weakne&s;s, which, in a few days, &s;he overcame &s;o well, as to be able to &s;et out with La Motte for B&mdash;, a village out of the great road, which he thought it prudent to quit. There they pa&s;&s;ed the following night, and early the next morning commenced their journey upon a wild and woody tract of country. They &s;topped about noon at a &s;olitary village, where they took refre&s;hments, and obtained di|rections for pa&s;&s;ing the va&s;t fore&s;t of Fontanville, upon the borders of which they now were. La Motte wi&s;hed at fir&s;t to take a guide, but he apprehended more evil from the di&s;cov|ery he might make of his route, than he hoped for benefit from a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the wilds of this uncultivated tract.</P>
<P>La Motte now de&s;igned to pa&s;s on to Lyons, where he could either &s;eek concealment in its neighbourhood, or embark on the Rhone for Geneva, &s;hould the emergency of his circum|&s;tances hereafter require him to leave France. It was about twelve o'clock at noon, and he was de&s;irous to ha&s;ten forward, that he might pa&s;s the fore&s;t of Fontanville, and reach the town on its oppo&s;ite borders, before night-fall. Having depo&s;ited a fre&s;h &s;tock of provi&s;ions in the carriage, and received &s;uch di|rections as were nece&s;&s;ary concerning the roads, they again &s;et forward, and in a &s;hort time entered upon the fore&s;t. It was now the latter end of April, and the weather was remarkably temperate and fine. The balmy fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, which breathed the fir&s;t pure e&s;&s;ence of vegetation; and the gentle warmth of the &s;un, who&s;e beams vivified every hue of nature, and opened every floweret of &s;pring, revived Adeline, and in|&s;pired her with life and health. As &s;he inhaled the breeze, her &s;trength &s;eemed to return, and as her eyes wandered through the romantic glades that opened into the fore&s;t, her heart was gladdened with complacent delight: but when from the&s;e objects &s;he turned her regard upon Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte, to who&s;e tender attentions &s;he owed her life, and in who&s;e looks &s;he now read e&s;teem and kindne&s;s, her bo&s;om glowed with &s;weet affections, and &s;he experienced a force of gratitude which might be called &s;ublime.</P>
<P>For the remainder of the day they continued to travel with|out &s;eeing a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, or meeting a human being. It was now near &s;un-&s;et, and the pro&s;pect being clo&s;ed on all &s;ides by the fore&s;t, La Motte began to have apprehen&s;ions that his &s;ervant had mi&s;taken the way. The road, if a road it could be called, which afforded only a &s;light track upon the gra&s;s, was &s;ome|times
<PB N="15" REF="029379_0008_0FE08867F5235908">
over-run by luxuriant vegetation, and &s;ometimes ob&s;cured by the deep &s;hades, and Peter at length &s;topped un|certain of the way. La Motte, who dreaded being benighted in a &s;cene &s;o wild and &s;olitary as this fore&s;t, and who&s;e apprehen&s;ions of banditti were very &s;anguine, ordered him to proceed at any rate, and, if he found no track, to endeavour to gain a more open part of the fore&s;t. With the&s;e orders, Peter again &s;et forwards, but having proceeded &s;ome way, and his views being &s;till confined by woody glades and fore&s;t walks, he began to de&s;pair of extricating him&s;elf, and &s;topped for further orders. The &s;un was now &s;et, but as La Motte looked-anxiou&s;ly from the window, he ob&s;erved upon the viv|id glow of the we&s;tern horizon, &s;ome dark towers ri&s;ing from among the trees at a little di&s;tance, and ordered Peter to drive towards them. "If they belong to mona&s;tery," &s;aid he, "we may probably gain admittance for the night."</P>
<P>The carrirge drove along under the &s;hade of "melancholy boughs," through which the evening twilight, which yet coloured the air, diffu&s;ed a &s;olemnity that vibrated in thrilling &s;en&s;ations upon the hearts of the travellers. Expectation kept them &s;ilent. The pre&s;ent &s;cene recalled to Adeline a remem|brance of the late terriffic circum&s;tances, and her mind re&s;|ponded but too ea&s;ily to the apprehen&s;ion of new misfortunes. La Motte alighted at the foot of a green knoll, where the trees again opening to light, permitted a nearer, though im|perfect view of the edifice.</P>

<P>HE approched, and perceived the Gothic remains of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> abbey: it &s;tood on a kind of rude lawn, over&s;hadowed by high and &s;preading trees, which &s;eemed coeval with the build|ing, and diffu&s;ed a romantic gloom around. The greater part of the pile a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eared to be &s;inking into ruins, and that, which had with&s;tood the ravages of time, &s;hewed the remaining features of the fabric more awful in decay. The lofty bat|tlements, thickly en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reathed with ivy, were half demoli&s;hed, and become the re&s;idence of birds of prey. Huge fragments of the ea&s;tern tower, which was almo&s;t demoli&s;hed, lay &s;cat|tered amid the high gra&s;s, that waved &s;lowly to the breeze. "The thri&s;tle &s;hook its lonely head; the mo&s;s whi&s;tled to the wind." A Gothic gate, richly ornamented with fret-work, which opened into the main body of the edifice, but which was now ob&s;tructed with bru&s;h-wood, remained entire. Above the va&s;t and magnificent portal of this gate aro&s;e a window of the &s;ame order, who&s;e pointed arches &s;till exhibited fragments of &s;tained gla&s;s, once the pride of monki&s;h devotion. La Motte, thinking it po&s;&s;ible it might yet &s;helter &s;ome hu|man being, advanced to the gate and lifted a ma&s;&s;y knocker. The hollow &s;ound rung through the emptine&s;s of the place. After waiting a few minutes, he forced back the gate, which was heavy with iron work, and creaked har&s;hly on its hinges.</P>
<P>He entered what appeared to have been the chapel of the abbey, where the hymn of devotion had once been rai&s;ed, and the tear of penitence had once been &s;hed; &s;ounds which could now only be recalled by imagination&mdash;tears of penitence, which had been long &s;ince fixed in fate. La Mote pau&s;ed a
<PB N="17" REF="029379_0009_0FE08956161B58F8">
moment, for he felt a &s;en&s;ation of &s;ublimity ri&s;ing into terror&mdash; a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of mingled a&s;toni&s;hment and awe! He &s;urveyed the va&s;tne&s;s of the place, and as he contemplated its ruins, fan|cy bore him back to pa&s;t ages. "And the&s;e walls," &s;aid he, "where once &s;uper&s;tition lurked, and au&s;terity anticipated an earthly purgatory, now tremble over the mortal remains of the beings who reared them!"</P>
<P>The deepening gloom now reminded La Motte that he had no time to lo&s;e, but curio&s;ity prompted him to explore far|ther, and he obeyed the impul&s;e. As he walked over the broken pavement, the &s;ound of his &s;teps ran in echoes through the place, and &s;eemed like the my&s;terious accents of the dead, reproving the &s;acrilegious mortal who thus dared to di&s;turb their precincts.</P>
<P>From this chappel he pa&s;&s;ed into the nave of the great church, of which one window more perfect than the re&s;t, op|ened upon a long vi&s;ta of the fore&s;t, through which was &s;een the rich colouring of evening, melting by imperceptible gra|dations into the &s;olemn grey of upper air. Dark hills, who&s;e outline appeared di&s;tinct upon the vivid glow of the hor|izon, clo&s;ed the per&s;pective. Several of the pillars, which had once &s;upported the roof, remained the proud effigies of &s;inking greatne&s;s, and &s;eemed to nod at every murmur of the bla&s;t over the fragments of tho&s;e that had fallen a little before them. La Motte &s;ighed. The compari&s;on between him&s;elf and the gradation of decay, which the&s;e columns exhibited, was but too obvious and affecting. "A few years," &s;aid he, "and I &s;hall become like the mortals on who&s;e reliques I now gaze, and, like them too, I may be the &s;ubject of me|ditation to a &s;ucceeding generation, which &s;hall totter but a little while over the object they contemplate, ere they al&s;o &s;ink into the du&s;t."</P>
<P>Retiring from this &s;cene, he walked through the cloi&s;ters, till a door, which communicated with the lofty part of the building attracted his curio&s;ity. He opened this and perceived, acro&s;s the foot of the &s;tairca&s;e, another door&mdash;but now, partly checked by fear, and partly by the recollection of the &s;urpri&s;e his family might feel in his ab&s;ence, he returned with ha&s;ty &s;tep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o his carriage, having wa&s;ted &s;ome of the precious mo|ments of twilight, and gained no information.</P>
<P>Some &s;light an&s;wer to Madame La Motte's inquiries, and a general direction to Peter to drive carefully on, and look for a
<PB N="18" REF="029379_0010_0FE089606FA07970">
road, was all that his anxiety would permit him to utter. The night &s;hade fell thick round, which deepened by the gloom of the fore&s;t, &s;oon rendered it dangerous to proceed. Peter &s;top|ped, but La Motte, per&s;i&s;ting in his fir&s;t determination, order|ed him to go on. Peter ventured to remon&s;trate, Madame La Motte entreated, but La Motte reproved&mdash;commanded, and at length repented; for the hind wheel ri&s;ing upon the &s;tump of in old tree, which the darkne&s;s had prevented Peter from ob|&s;erving, the carriage was in an in&s;tant overturned.</P>
<P>The party, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, were much terrified, but no one was materially hurt, and having di&s;engaged them&s;elves from their perilous &s;ituation, La Motte and Peter endeavoured to rai&s;e the carriage. The extent of this misfortune was now di&s;covered, for they perceived that the wheel was broke. Their di&s;tre&s;s was rea&s;onably great, for not only was the coach di&s;a|bled from proceeding, but it could not even afford a &s;helter from the cold dews of the night, it being impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve it in an upright &s;ituation. After a few moment's &s;ilence, La Motte propo&s;ed that they &s;hould return to the ruins which they had ju&s;t quitted, which lay at a very &s;hort di&s;tance, and pa&s;s the night in the mo&s;t habitable part of them: that, when morn|ing dawned, Peter &s;hould take one of the coach hor&s;es, and endeavour to find a road and a town, from whence a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be procured for repairing the carriage. This propo&s;al was oppo&s;ed by Madame La Motte, who &s;huddered at the idea of pa&s;&s;ing &s;o many hours of darkne&s;s in a place &s;o forlorn as the mona&s;tery. Terrors which &s;he neither endeavoured to ex|amine, or combat, overcame her, and &s;he told La Motte &s;he had rather remain expo&s;ed to the unwhole&s;ome dews of night, than encounter the de&s;olation of the ruins. La Motte had at fir&s;t felt an equal reluctance to return to this &s;pot, but having &s;ubdued his own feelings, he re&s;olved not to yield to tho&s;e of his wife.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es being now di&s;engaged from the carriage, the party moved towards the edifice. As they proceeded, Peter, who followed them, &s;truck a light, and they entered the ruins by the flame of &s;ticks, which he had collected. The partial gleams thrown acro&s;s the fabric &s;eemed to make its de&s;olation more &s;olemn, while the ob&s;curity of the greater part of the pile heightened its &s;ublimity, and led fancy on to &s;cenes of horror. Adeline who had hitherto remained in &s;ilence, now uttered an exclamation of mingled admiration and fear. A kind of plea&s;ing dread thrilled her bo&s;om, and filled all her
<PB N="19" REF="029379_0010_0FE089606FA07970">
&s;oul. Tears &s;tarted into her eyes:&mdash;&s;he wi&s;hed, yet feared to go on;&mdash;&s;he hung upon the arm of La Motte, and looked at him with a &s;ort of he&s;itating interrogation.</P>
<P>He opened the door of the great hall, and they entered: its extent was lo&s;t in gloom. "Let us &s;tay here," &s;aid Madame de la Motte, "I will go no farther." La Motte pointed to the broken roof, and was proceeding, when he was interrup|ted by an uncommon noi&s;e, which pa&s;&s;ed along the hall. They were all &s;ilent&mdash;it was the &s;ilence of terror. Madame La Motte &s;poke fir&s;t. "Let us quit this &s;pot," &s;aid &s;he, "any evil is preferable to the feeling, which now oppre&s;&s;es me. Let us retire in&s;tantly." The &s;tillne&s;s had for &s;ome time remained undi&s;turbed, and La Motte, a&s;hamed of the fear he had involuntarily betrayed, now thought it nece&s;&s;ary to affect a boldne&s;s, which he did not feel. He, therefore, oppo&s;ed ridicule to the terror of Madame, and in&s;i&s;ted upon proceed|ing. Thus compelled to acquie&s;ce, &s;he traver&s;ed the hall with trembling &s;teps. They came to a narrow, pa&s;&s;age, and Peter's &s;ticks being nearly exhau&s;ted, they awaited here, while he went in &s;earch of more.</P>
<P>The almo&s;t expiring light fla&s;hed faintly upon the walls of the pa&s;&s;age, &s;hewing the rece&s;s more horrible. Acro&s;s the hall, the greater part of which was concealed in &s;hadow, the feeble ray &s;pread a tremulous gleam, exhibiting the cha&s;m in the roof, while many namele&s;s objects were &s;een imperfectly through the du&s;k. Adeline with a &s;mile, inquired of La Motte, if he believed in &s;pirits. The que&s;tion was ill-timed, for the pre&s;ent &s;cene impre&s;&s;ed its terrors upon La Motte, and, in &s;pite of endeavour, he felt a &s;uper&s;titious dread &s;tealing upon him. He was now, perhaps, &s;tanding over the a&s;hes of the dead. If &s;pirits were ever permitted to revi&s;it the earth, this &s;eemed the hour and the place mo&s;t &s;uitable for their ap|pearance. La Motte remaining &s;ilent, Adeline &s;aid, "Were I inclined to &s;uper&s;tion,"&mdash;She was interrupted by a return of the noi&s;e, which had been lately heard. It &s;ounded down the pa&s;&s;age, at who&s;e entrance they &s;tood, and &s;unk gradually away. Every heart palpitated, and they remained li&s;tening in &s;ilence. A new &s;ubject of apprehen&s;ion &s;eized La Motte:&mdash; the noi&s;e might proceed from banditti, and he he&s;itated whe|ther it would be &s;afe to proceed. Peter now came with the light: Madame refu&s;ed to enter the pa&s;&s;age&mdash;La Motte was not much inclined to it; but Peter, in whom curio&s;ity was more prevalent than fear readily offered his &s;ervices. La
<PB N="20" REF="029379_0011_0FE08966305E2038">
Motte, after &s;ome he&s;itation, &s;uffered him to go, while he awaited at the entrance the re&s;ult of the inquiry. The extent of the pa&s;&s;age &s;oon concealed Peter from view, and the echoes of his foot&s;teeps were lo&s;t in a &s;ound, which ru&s;hed along the avenue, and became fainter and fainter, till it &s;unk into &s;i|lence. La Motte now called aloud to Peter, but no an&s;wer was returned; at length, they heard the &s;ound of a di&s;tant foot&s;tep, and Peter &s;oon after appeared, breathle&s;s, and pale with fear.</P>
<P>When he came within hearing of La Motte, he called out, "An plea&s;e your honour, I've done for them, I believe, but I've had a hard bout. I thought I was fighting with the devil."&mdash;"What are you &s;peaking of?" &s;aid La Motte.</P>
<P>"They were nothing but owls and rooks after all," con|tinued Peter; "but the light brought them all about my ears, and they made &s;uch a confounded clapping with their wings, that I thought at fir&s;t I had been be&s;et with a legion of devils. But I have drove them all out, ma&s;ter, and you have nothing to fear now."</P>
<P>The latter part of the &s;entence, intimating a &s;u&s;picion of his courage, La Motte could have di&s;pen&s;ed with, and, to re|trieve in &s;ome degree his reputation, he made a point of pro|ceeding through the pa&s;&s;age. They now moved on with alacrity, for as Peter &s;aid, they had "nothing to fear."</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age led into a large area, on one &s;ide of which, over a range of cloi&s;ters, appeared the we&s;t tower, and a lofty part of the edifice; the other &s;ide was open to the woods. La Motte led the way to a door of the tower, which he now perceived was the &s;ame he had formerly entered; but he found &s;ome difficulty in advancing, for the area was overgrown with brambles and nettles, and the light, which Peter carried, afforded only an uncertain gleam. When he unclo&s;ed the door, the di&s;mal a&s;pect of the place revived the apprehen&s;ions of Madame La Motte, and extorted from Adeline an inquiry whither they were going. Peter held up the light to &s;hew the narrow &s;tairca&s;e that wound round the tower; but La Motte ob&s;erving the &s;econd door, drew back the ru&s;ty bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and entered a &s;pacious apartment, which, from its &s;tile and condition, was evidently of a much later date than the other part of the &s;tructure: though de&s;olate and forlorn, it was very little impaired by time; the walls were damp, but not decay|ed; and the gla&s;s was yet firm in the windows.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="029379_0011_0FE08966305E2038">They pa&s;&s;ed on to a &s;uit of apartments re&s;embling the fir&s;t they had &s;een, and expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urpri&s;e at the incongruous appearance of this part of the edifice with the mouldering walls they had left behind. The&s;e apartments conducted them to a winding pa&s;&s;age, that received light and air through nar|row cavities placed high in the wall and was at length clo&s;ed by a door barred with iron, which being with &s;ome difficulty opened, they entered a vaulted room. La Motte &s;urveyed it with a &s;crutinizing eye, and endeavoured to conjecture for what purpo&s;e it had been guarded by a door of &s;uch &s;trength; but he &s;aw ilttle within to a&s;&s;i&s;t his curio&s;ity. The room ap|peared to have been built in modern times upon a Gothic plan. Adeline approached a large window that formed a kind of rece&s;s rai&s;ed by one &s;tep over the level of the floor; &s;he ob&s;erved to La Motte that the whole floor was inlaid with Mo&s;aic work; which drew from him a remark, that the &s;tyle of this apartment was not &s;trictly Gothic. He pa&s;&s;ed on to a door, which appeared on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the apartment, and unlocking it, found him&s;elf in the great hall, by which he had entered the fabric.</P>
<P>He now perceived, what the gloom had before concealed, a &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e, which led to a gallery above; and which, from its pre&s;ent condition, &s;eemed to have been built with the more modern part of the fabric, though this al&s;o affected the Gothic mode of architecture: La Motte had little doubt that the&s;e &s;tairs led to apartments, corre&s;ponding with tho&s;e he had pa&s;&s;ed below, and he&s;itated whether to explore them: but the entreaties of Madame, who was much fatigued, prevailed with him to defer all further examination. After &s;ome delib|eration, in which of the rooms they &s;hould pa&s;s the night, they determined to return to that which opened from the tower.</P>
<P>A fire was kindled on a hearth, which it is probable had not for many years before afforded the warmth of ho&s;pitali|ty; and Peter having &s;pread the provi&s;ion he had brought from the coach, La Motte and his family, encircled round the fire, partook of a repa&s;t, which hunger and fatigue made de|licious. Apprehen&s;ion gradually gave way to confidence, for they now found them&s;elves in &s;omething like a human habi|tation, and they had lei&s;ure to laugh at their late terrors; but, as the bla&s;t &s;hook the doors, Adeline often &s;tarted, and threw a fearful glance around. They continued to laugh and talk cheerfully for a time; yet their merriment was tran&s;ient, if not affected; for a &s;en&s;e of their peculiar and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="22" REF="029379_0012_0FE0897777EF03F8">
pre&s;&s;ed upon their recollection, and &s;unk each in|dividual into langour and pen&s;ive &s;ilence. Adeline felt the forlornne&s;s of her condition with energy; &s;he reflected upon the pa&s;t with a&s;toni&s;hment, and anticipated the future with fear. She found her&s;elf wholly dependent upon &s;trangers, with no other claim than what di&s;tre&s;s demands from the common &s;ympathy of kindred beings; &s;ighs &s;welled her heart, and the frequent tear &s;tarted to her eye; but &s;he checked it, ere it betrayed on her cheek the &s;orrow, which &s;he thought it would be ungrateful to reveal.</P>
<P>La Motte, at length, broke this meditative &s;ilence, by di|recting the fire to be renewed for the night, and the door to be &s;ecured: this &s;eemed a nece&s;&s;ary precaution, even in this &s;olitude, and was effected by means of large &s;tones piled again&s;t it, for other fa&s;tening there was none. It had fre|quently occurred to La Motte, that this apparently for&s;aken edifice might be a place of refuge to banditti. Here was &s;olitude to conceal them; and a wild and exten&s;ive fore&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;chemes of rapine, and to perplex, with its labyrinths, tho&s;e who might be bold enough to attempt pur&s;uit. The&s;e apprehen&s;ions, however, he hid within his own bo&s;om, &s;aving his companions from a &s;hare of the unea&s;ine&s;s they occa&s;ioned. Peter was ordered to watch at the door, and having gives the fire a rou&s;ing &s;tir, our de&s;olate party drew round it, and &s;ought in &s;leep a &s;hort oblivion of care.</P>
<P>The night pa&s;&s;ed on without di&s;turbance. Adeline &s;lept, but unea&s;y dreams fleeted before her fancy, and &s;he awoke at an early hour: the recollection of her &s;orrows aro&s;e upon her mind, and yielded to their pre&s;&s;ure, her tears flowed &s;i|lently and fa&s;t. That &s;he might indulge them without re|&s;traint, &s;he went to a window that looked upon an open part of the fore&s;t; all was gloom and &s;ilence; &s;he &s;tood for &s;ome time viewing the &s;hadowy &s;cene.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t tender tints of morning now appeared on the verge of the horizon, &s;tealing upon the darkne&s;s;&mdash;&s;o pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o fine, &s;o aetherial! it &s;eemed as if Heaven was opening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the view. The dark mi&s;ts were &s;een to roll off to the we&s;t, as the tints of light grew &s;tronger, deepening the ob&s;curity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that part of the hemi&s;phere, and involving the features of the country below; meanwhile, in the ea&s;t, the hues became more vivid, darting a trembling lu&s;tre far around, till a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+dy glow, which fired all that part of the Heavens, announce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ri&s;ing &s;un. At fir&s;t, a &s;mall line of inconceivable &s;plen+dor
<PB N="23" REF="029379_0012_0FE0897777EF03F8">
emerged on the horizon, which quickly expanding, the &s;un appeared in all his glory, unveiling the whole face of na|ture, vivifying every colour of the land&s;cape, and &s;prinkling the dewy earth with glittering light. The low and gentle re&s;pon&s;es of birds, awakened by the morning ray, now broke the &s;ilence of the hour; their &s;oft warbling ri&s;ing by degrees till they &s;welled the chorus of univer&s;al gladne&s;s. Adeline's heart &s;welled too with gratitude and adoration.</P>
<P>The &s;cene before her &s;oothed her mind, and exalted her thoughts to the great Author of Nature; &s;he uttered an in|voluntary prayer: "Father of good, who made this glorious &s;cene! I re&s;ign my&s;elf to thy hands: thou wilt &s;upport me under my pre&s;ent &s;orrows, and protect me from future evil."</P>
<P>Thus confiding in the benevolence of God, &s;he wiped the tears from her eyes, while the &s;weet union of con&s;cience and reflection rewarded her tru&s;t; and her mind, lo&s;ing the feelings which had lately oppre&s;&s;ed it, became tranquil and compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>La Motte awoke &s;oon after, and Peter prepared to &s;et out on his expedition. As he mounted his hor&s;e "An' plea&s;e you, Ma&s;ter." &s;aid he, "I think we had as good look no far|ther for an habitation till better times turn up; for nobody will think of looking for us here; and when one &s;ees the place by day light, its none &s;o bad, but what a little patching up would make it comfortable enough." La Motte made no reply, but he thought of Peter's words. During the intervals of the night, when anxiety had kept him waking, the &s;ame idea had occurred to him; concealment was his only &s;ecurity, and this place afforded it. The de&s;olation of the &s;pot was repul&s;ive to his wi&s;hes; but he had only a choice of evil; a fore&s;t with liberty was not a bad home for one, who had too much rea&s;on to expect a pri&s;on. As he walked through the apartments, and examined their condition more attentively, he perceived they might ea&s;ily be made habitable; and now &s;urveying them under the cheerfulne&s;s of morning, his de&s;ign &s;trengthened; and he mu&s;ed upon the means of accompli&s;h|ing it, which nothing &s;eemed &s;o much to ob&s;truct as the ap|parent difficulty of procuring food.</P>
<P>He communicated his thoughts to Madame La Motte, who felt repugnance to the &s;cheme. La Motte, however &s;eldom con&s;ulted his wife till he had determined how to act; and he had already re&s;olved to be guided in this affair by the report of Peter. If he could di&s;cover a town in the neighbourhood of the fore&s;t, where provi&s;ion and other nece&s;&s;aries could be procured, he would &s;eek no farther for a place of re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="029379_0013_0FE0897C0C0408D8">In the mean time, he &s;pent the anxious interval of Peter's ab&s;ence in examining the ruin, and walking over the en|virons; they were &s;weetly romantic, and the luxuriant woods, with which they abounded, &s;eemed to &s;eque&s;ter this &s;pot from the re&s;t of the world. Frequently a natural vi&s;ta would yield a view of the country, terminated by hills, which retiring in di&s;tance, faded into the blue horizon. A &s;tream, various and mu&s;ical in its cour&s;e, wound at the foot of the lawn, on which &s;tood the abbey; here it &s;ilently glided beneath the &s;hades, feeding the flowers that bloomed on its banks, and diffu&s;ing dewy fre&s;hne&s;s around; there it &s;pread in broad expan&s;e to|day, reflecting the &s;ylvan &s;cene, and the wild deer that ta&s;ted its waves. La Motte ob&s;erved every where a profu&s;ion of game; the phea&s;ants &s;carcely flew from his approach, and the deer gazed mildly at him as he pa&s;&s;ed. They were &s;trangers to man!</P>
<P>On his return to the abbey, La Motte a&s;cended the &s;tairs that led to the tower. About half way up, a door appeared in the wall; it yielded, without re&s;i&s;tance, to his hand; but, a &s;udden noi&s;e within, accompanied by a cloud of du&s;t, made him &s;tep back and clo&s;e the door. After waiting a few min|utes, he again opened it, and perceived a large room of the more modern building. The remains of tape&s;try hung in tat|ters upon the walls, which were become the re&s;idence of birds of prey, who&s;e &s;udden flight on the opening of the door had brought down a quantity of du&s;t, and occa&s;ioned the noi&s;e. The windows were &s;hattered, and almo&s;t without gla&s;s: but he was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve &s;ome remains of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, who&s;e fa&s;hion and condition bore the date of their antiquity; a broken able, and an iron gate almo&s;t con&s;umed by ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the room was a door, which led to another apartment, proportioned like the fir&s;t, but hung with arras &s;omewhat le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tered. In one corner &s;tood a &s;mall bed&s;tead and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tered chairs were placed round the walls. La Motte gazed with a mixture of wonder and curio&s;ity. "'Tis &s;trange," &s;aid he, "that the&s;e rooms and the&s;e alone, &s;hould bear the marks of inhabitation; perhaps, &s;ome wretched wanderer, like my&s;elf, may have here &s;ought refuge from a per&s;ecuting world; and here, perhaps, laid down the load of exi&s;tence: perhaps, too, I have followed his foot&s;teps, but to mingle my du&s;t with his!" He turned &s;ud|denly, and was about to quit the room, when he perceived a &s;mall door <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r the bed; it opened into a clo&s;et, which was
<PB N="25" REF="029379_0013_0FE0897C0C0408D8">
lighted by one &s;mall window, and was in the &s;ame condition as the apartments he had pa&s;&s;ed, except that it was de&s;titute even of the remains of furniture. As he walked over the floor, he thought he felt one part of it &s;hake beneath his &s;teps, and, examining, found a trap door. Curio&s;ity prompted him to ex|plore farther, and with &s;ome difficulty he opened it. It di&s;|clo&s;ed a &s;tairca&s;e which terminated in darkne&s;s. La Motte de&s;cended a few &s;teps, but was unwilling to tru&s;t the aby&s;s; and, after wondering for what purpo&s;e it was &s;o &s;ecretly con|&s;tructed, he clo&s;ed the trap, and quitted this &s;uit of apartments.</P>
<P>The &s;tairs in the tower above were &s;o much decayed, that he did not attempt to a&s;cend them: he returned to the hall, and by the &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e, which he had ob&s;erved the evening before, reached the gallery, and found another &s;uit of apart|ments entirely unfurni&s;hed, very much like tho&s;e below.</P>
<P>He renewed with Madame La Motte his former conver&s;a|tion re&s;pecting the abbey, and &s;he exerted all her endeavours to di&s;&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e, acknowledging the &s;olitary &s;ecurity of the &s;pot, but pleading that other places might be found equally well adapted for concealment and more for com|fort. This La Motte doubted: be&s;ides, the fore&s;t abounded with game, which would at once, afford him amu&s;ement and food, a circum&s;tance, con&s;idering his &s;mall &s;tock of money, by no means to be overlooked: and he had &s;uffered his mind to dwell &s;o much upon the &s;cheme, that it was become a favou|rite one. Adeline li&s;tened in &s;ilent anxiety to the di&s;cour&s;e, and waited the i&s;&s;ue of Peter's report.</P>
<P>The morning pa&s;&s;ed, but Peter did not return. Our &s;oli|tary party took their dinner of the provi&s;ion they had fortu|nately brought with them, and afterwards walked forth into the woods. Adeline, who never &s;uffered any good to pa&s;s unnoticed, becau&s;e it came attended with evil, forgot for a while the de&s;olation of the abbey in the beauty of the adja|cent &s;cenery. The plea&s;antne&s;s of the &s;hades &s;oothed her heart, and the varied features of the land&s;cape amu&s;ed her fan|cy; &s;he almo&s;t thought &s;he could be contented to live here. Already &s;he began to feel an intere&s;t in the concerns of her companions, and for Madame La Motte &s;he felt more; it was the warm emotion of gratitude and affection.</P>
<P>The afternoon wore away, and they returned to the abbey. Peter was &s;till ab&s;ent, and his ab&s;ence now began to excite &s;ur|pri&s;e and apprehen&s;ion. The approach of darkne&s;s al&s;o threw a gloom upon the hopes of the wanderers: another night mu&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="029379_0014_0FE0898A15BDB450">
be pa&s;&s;ed under the &s;ame forlorn circum&s;tances as the preceding one; and, what was &s;till wor&s;e, with a very &s;canty &s;tock of provi&s;ions. The fortitude of Madame La Motte now entirely for&s;ook her, and &s;he wept bitterly. Adeline's heart was as mournful as Madame's, but &s;he rallied her drooping &s;pirits, and gave the fir&s;t in&s;tance of her kindne&s;s by endeavouring to revive tho&s;e of her friend.</P>
<P>La Motte was re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y, and, leaving the abbey, he walked alone the way which Peter had taken. He had not gone far, when he perceived him between the trees, lead|ing his hor&s;e. "What news, Petter?" hallooed La Motte. Peter came on, panting for breath, and &s;aid not a word, till La Motte repeated the que&s;tion in a tone of &s;omewhat more authority. "Ah, ble&s;s you Ma&s;ter!" &s;aid he, when he had taken breath to an&s;wer, "I am glad to &s;ee you; I thought I &s;hould never have got back again: I've met with a world of misfortunes."</P>
<P>"Well, you may relate them hereafter; let me hear whe|ther you have di&s;covered&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Di&s;covered!" interrupted Peter, Yes, I am di&s;covered with a vengeance! If your Honour will look at my arms, you'll &s;ee how I am di&s;covered."</P>
<P>"Di&s;coloured! I &s;uppo&s;e you mean," &s;aid La Motte. "But how came you in this condition?"</P>
<P>"Why, I'll tell you how it was, Sir; your Honour knows I learned a &s;mack of boxing of that Engli&s;hman that u&s;ed to come with his ma&s;ter to our hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Well, well&mdash;tell me where you have been."</P>
<P>"I &s;carcely know my&s;elf, Ma&s;ter; I've been where I got a &s;ound drubbing, but then it was in your bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;o I don't mind. But if ever I meet with that ra&s;cal again!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"You &s;eem to like your fir&s;t drubbing &s;o well, that you want another, and unle&s;s you &s;peak more to the purpo&s;e, you &s;hall &s;oon have one."</P>
<P>Peter was now frightened into method, and endeavoured to proceed: "When I left the old abbey," &s;aid he, "I follow|ed the way you directed, and, turning to the right of that grove of trees yonder, I looked this way and that, to &s;ee if I could &s;ee a hou&s;e, or a cottage, or even a man, but not a <HI>&s;oul</HI> of them was to be &s;een, and &s;o I jogged on, near the value of a league, I warrant, and then I came to a track; oh! oh &s;ays I, we have you now; this will do&mdash;paths can't be made without feet. However, I was out in my reckoning, for the
<PB N="27" REF="029379_0014_0FE0898A15BDB450">
devil a bit of a <HI>&s;oul</HI> could I &s;ee, and after following the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rack this way and that way, for the third of a league, I lo&s;t it, and had to find out another."</P>
<P>"Is it impo&s;&s;ible for you to &s;peak to the point?" &s;aid La Motte: "omit the&s;e fooli&s;h particulars, and tell whether you have &s;ucceeded."</P>
<P>"Well, then, Ma&s;ter, to be &s;hort for that's the neare&s;t way after all, I wandered a long while at random, I did not know where, all through a fore&s;t like this, and I took &s;pe|cial care to note how the trees &s;tood, that I might find my way back. At la&s;t I came to another path, and was &s;ure I &s;hould find &s;omething now, though I had found nothing before, for I could not be mi&s;taken twice; &s;o, peeping between the trees, I &s;pied a cottage, and I gave my hor&s;e a la&s;h, that &s;oun|ded through the fore&s;t, and I was at the door in a minute. They told me there was a town about half a league off, and bade me follow the track and it would bring me there, &s;o it did; and my hor&s;e I believe &s;melt the coin in the manger by the rate he went at. I inquired for a wheel-wright, and was told there was but one in the place, and he could not be found. I waited and waited, for I knew it was in vain to think of returning without doing my bu&s;ine&s;s. The man at la&s;t came home from the country, and I told him how long I had wait|ed; for, &s;ays I, I knew it was in vain to return without my bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>"Do be le&s;s tedious," &s;aid La Motte, if it is in thy nature."</P>
<P>"It is in my nature," an&s;wered Peter, "and if it was more in my nature, your Honour &s;hould have it all. Would you think it, Sir, the fellow had the impudence to a&s;k a louis-d'or for mending the coach wheel! I believe in my con&s;cience he &s;aw I was in a hurry and could not do without him. A louis-d'or! &s;ays I, my Ma&s;ter &s;hall give no &s;uch price, he &s;ha'n't be impo&s;ed upon by no &s;uch ra&s;cal as you. Whereupon, the fel|low looked glum, and gave me a dou&s;e o'the chops: with this, I up with my fi&s;t and gave him another, and &s;hould have beat him pre&s;ently, if another man had not come in, and then I was obliged to give up."</P>
<P>"And &s;o you are returned as wi&s;e as you went?"</P>
<P>"Why Ma&s;ter, I hope I have too much &s;pirit to &s;ubmit to a ra&s;cal, or let you &s;ubmit to one either; be&s;ides, I have bought &s;ome nails to try if I can't mend the wheel my&s;elf &mdash; I had always a hand at carpentry."</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="029379_0015_0FE0899014681348">"Well, I commend your zeal in my cau&s;e, but on this oc|ca&s;ion it was rather ill-timed. And what have you got in that ba&s;ket?"</P>
<P>"Why, Ma&s;ter, I bethought me that we could not get a|way from this place till the carriage was ready to draw us, and in the mean time, &s;ays I, no body can live without vic|tuals, &s;o I'll e'en lay out the little money I have and take a ba&s;ket with me."</P>
<P>"That's the only wi&s;e thing you have done yet, and, this indeed, redeems your blunders."</P>
<P>"Why, now, Ma&s;ter it does my heart good to hear you &s;peak; I knew I was doing for the be&s;t all the while: but I've had a hard job to find my way back; and here's another piece of ill luck, for the hor&s;e has got a thorn in his foot."</P>
<P>La Motte made inquiries concerning the town, and found it was capable of &s;upplying him with provi&s;ion, and what little furniture was nece&s;&s;ary to render the abbey habitable. This intelligence almo&s;t &s;ettled his plans, and he ordered Pe|ter to return on the following morning and make inquiries concerning the abbey. If the an&s;wers were favourable to his wi&s;hes, he commi&s;&s;ioned him to buy a cart, and load it with &s;ome furniture, and &s;ome materials nece&s;&s;ary for repairing the modern apartments. Peter &s;tared: "What, does your Hon|our mean to live here?"</P>
<P>"Why, &s;uppo&s;e I do?"</P>
<P>"Why then your Honour has made a wi&s;e determination, according to my hint; for your Honour knows I &s;aid"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well, Peter, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to repeat what you &s;aid; perhaps I had determined on the &s;ubject before."</P>
<P>"Egad, Ma&s;ter, you're in the right, and I'm glad of it, for, I believe, we &s;hall not quickly be di&s;turbed here, except by the rooks and owls. Yes, yes&mdash;I warrant I'll make it a place fit for a king; and as for the town, one may get any thing, I'm &s;ure of that; though they think no more about this place than they do about India or England, or any of tho&s;e places."</P>
<P>They now reached the abbey, where Peter was received with great joy; but the hopes of his mi&s;tre&s;s and Adeline were repre&s;&s;ed, when they learned that he returned, without having executed his commi&s;&s;ion, and heard his account of the town. La Motte's orders to Peter were heard with almo&s;t equal concern by Madame and Adeline; but the latter con|cealed her unea&s;ine&s;s, and u&s;ed all her efforts to overcome that
<PB N="29" REF="029379_0015_0FE0899014681348">
of her friend. The &s;weetne&s;s of her behaviour, and the air of &s;atisfaction &s;he a&s;&s;umed, &s;en&s;ibly affected Madame, and di&s;covered to her a &s;ource of comfort, which &s;he had hither|to overlooked. The affectionate attentions of her young friend promi&s;ed to con&s;ole her for the want of other &s;ociety, and her conver&s;ation to enliven the hours which might other|wi&s;e be pa&s;&s;ed in painful regret.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations and general behaviour of Adeline already be&s;poke a good under&s;tanding, and an amiable heart, but &s;he had yet more&mdash;&s;he had genious. She was now in her nine|teenth year; her figure of the middling &s;ize, and turned to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite proportion; her hair was dark auburn, her eyes blue, and whether they &s;parkled with intelligence, or melted with tenderne&s;s, they were equally attractive: her form had the airy lightne&s;s of a nymph, and, when &s;he &s;miled, her countenance might have been drawn for the younger &s;i&s;ter of Hebe: the captivations of her beauty were heightened by the grace and &s;implicity of her manners, and confirmed by the intrin&s;ic value of a heart
<Q><L>"That might be &s;hrin'd in cry&s;tal.</L>
<L>"And have all its movements &s;cann'd."</L></Q></P>
<P>Annette now kindled the fire for the night: Peter's ba&s;ket was opened, and &s;upper prepared. Madame La Motte was &s;till pen&s;ive and &s;ilent. "There is &s;carcely any condition &s;o bad," &s;aid Adeline, "but we may one time or other wi&s;h we had not qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted it. Hone&s;t Peter, when he was bewilder|ed in the fore&s;t, or had two enemies to encounter in&s;tead of one, confe&s;&s;es he wi&s;hed him&s;elf at the abbey. And I am certain, there is no &s;ituation &s;o de&s;titute, but comfort may be extracted from it. The blaze of this fire &s;hines yet more cheerfully from the contra&s;ted drearine&s;s of the place; and this plentiful repa&s;t is made yet more delicious, from the tem|porary want we have &s;uffered. Let us enjoy the good and forget the evil."</P>
<P>"You &s;peak, my dear," replied Madame La Motte, "like one, who&s;e &s;pirits have not been often depre&s;&s;ed by misfortune, (Adeline &s;ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e) and who&s;e hopes are, therefore, vigorous." "Long &s;uffering" &s;aid La Motte, "has &s;ubdued in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that ela&s;tic energy, which repels the pre&s;&s;ure of evil, and dances to the bound of joy. But I &s;peak in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, though only from the remembrance of &s;uch a time.

<P><PB N="30" REF="029379_0016_0FE0899E16419220">"And may now, my dear Sir," &s;aid Adeline. "Still be|lieve it po&s;&s;ible, and you will find it is &s;o."</P>
<P>"The illu&s;ion is gone&mdash;I can no longer deceive my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Sir, if I &s;ay, it is now only you deceive your&s;elf, by &s;uffering the cloud of &s;orrow to tinge every ob|ject you look upon."</P>
<P>"It may be &s;o," &s;aid La Motte, "but let us leave the &s;ubject."</P>
<P>After &s;upper, the doors were &s;ecured, as before, for the night, and the wanderers re&s;igned them&s;elves to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the following morning, Peter again &s;et out for the lit|tle town of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and the hours of his ab&s;ence were again &s;pent by Madame La Motte and Adeline in much anxiety and &s;ome hope, for the intelligence he might bring concerning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey, might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> relea&s;e them from the plans of La Motte.

He brought materials for repairing the place, and &s;ome furniture.</P>
<P>Of the abbey he gave an account, of which the following is the &s;ub&s;tance:&mdash;It belonged, together with a large part of the adjacent fore&s;t, to a nobleman, who now re&s;ided with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily on a remote e&s;tate. He inherited it, in right of his wife from his father-in-law, who had cau&s;ed the more mod|ern apartments to be erected, and had re&s;ided in them &s;ome part of every year, for the purpo&s;e of &s;hooting and hunting. It was reported, that &s;ome per&s;on was &s;oon after it came to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, brought &s;ecretly to the abbey and con|fined in the&s;e apartments; who, or what he was had never been conjectured, and what became of him no body knew. The report died gradually away, and many per&s;ons entirely di&s;believed the whole of it. But however this affair might be, certain it was, the pre&s;ent owner had vi&s;ited <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> abbey only two &s;ummers, &s;ince his &s;ucceeding to it; and the furniture af|ter &s;ome time, was removed.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance at fir&s;t excited &s;urpri&s;e, and various re|ports aro&s;e in con&s;equence, but it was difficult to know what ought to be believed. Among the re&s;t it was &s;aid, that &s;trange appearances had been ob&s;erved at the abbey, and un|common noi&s;es heard; and though this report had been rid|iculed by &s;en&s;ible per&s;ons as the idle &s;uper&s;tition of igno|rance, it had fa&s;tened &s;o &s;trongly upon the minds of the com|mon people, that for the la&s;t &s;eventeen year&punc; none of the pea&s;|antry had ventured to approach the &s;pot. The abbey was now, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, abandoned to decay.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="029379_0016_0FE0899E16419220">La Motte ruminated upon this account. At fir&s;t, it called up unplea&s;ant ideas, but they were &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and con&s;i|derations more intere&s;ting to his welfare took place&punc; he con|gratulated him&s;elf that he had now found a &s;pot, where he was not likely to be either di&s;covered or di&s;turbed; yet it could not e&s;cape him that there was a &s;trange coincidence between one part of Peter's narrative, and the condition of the cham|bers that opened from the tower above &s;tairs. The remains of furniture&punc; of which the other apartments were void&mdash;the &s;olitary bed&mdash;the number and connection of the rooms, were circum&s;tances that united to confirm his opinion. This, how|ever, he concealed in his own brea&s;t, for he already perceived that Peter's account had not a&s;&s;i&s;ted in reconciling his family to the nece&s;&s;ity of dwelling at the abbey.</P>
<P>But they had only to &s;ubmit in &s;ilence, and whatever di&s;a|greeable apprehen&s;ion might intrude upon them, they now appeared willing to &s;uppre&s;s the expre&s;&s;ion of it. Peter, in|deed, was exempt from any evil of this kind; he knew no fear, and his mind was now wholly occupied with his ap|proaching bu&s;ine&s;s. Madame La Motte, with a placed kind of de&s;pair, endeavoured to reconcile her&s;elf to that, which no effort of under&s;tanding could teach her to avoid, and which, an indulgence in lamentation, could only make more intolera|ble. Indeed, though a &s;en&s;e of the immediate inconveniences to be endured at the abbey, had made her oppo&s;e the &s;cheme of living there, &s;he did not really know how their &s;ituation, could be improved by removal: yet her thoughts often wan|dered towards Paris, and reflected the retro&s;pect of pa&s;t times, with the images of weeping friends left, perhaps, for ever. The affectionate endearments of her only &s;on, whom, from the danger of his &s;ituation, and the ob&s;curity of hers, &s;he might rea&s;onably fear never to &s;ee again, aro&s;e upon her memory and overcame her fortitude. "Why, why was I re&s;erved for this hour?" would &s;he &s;ay, "and what will be my years to come?"</P>
<P>Adeline had no retro&s;pect of pa&s;t delight to give empha&s;is to pre&s;ent calamity&mdash;no weeping friends&mdash;no dear regretted objects to point the edge of &s;orrow, and throw a &s;ickly hue upon her future pro&s;pects: &s;he knew not yet the pangs of di&s;|appointed hope, or the acuter &s;ting of &s;elf accu&s;ation; &s;he had no mi&s;ery, but what patience could a&s;&s;uage, or fortitude overcome.</P>
<P>At the dawn of the following day Peter aro&s;e to his labour: he proceeded with alacrity, and, in a few days, two of the
<PB N="32" REF="029379_0017_0FE089A2AA9A1CD8">
lower apartments were &s;o much altered for the better, that La Motte began to exult, and his family to perceive that their &s;ituation would not be &s;o mi&s;erable as they had imagined. The furniture Peter had already brought was di&s;po&s;ed in the&s;e rooms, one of which was the vaulted apartment. Madame La Motte furni&s;hed this as a fitting room, preferring it for its large Gothic Window, that de&s;cended almo&s;t to the floor, ad|mitting a pro&s;pect of the lawn, and the picture&s;que &s;cenery of the &s;urrounding woods.</P>
<P>Peter having returned to Auboine for a farther &s;upply, all the lower apartments were in a few weeks not only habitable, but comfortable. The&s;e, however, being in&s;ufficient for the accommodation of the family, a room above &s;tairs was pre|pared for Adeline; it was the chamber that opened immedi|ately from the tower, and &s;he preferred it to tho&s;e beyond, be|cau&s;e it was le&s;s di&s;tant from the family, and the windows fronting an avenue of the fore&s;t, afforded a more exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. The tape&s;try, that was decayed, and hung loo&s;ely from the walls, was now nailed up, and made to look le&s;s de&s;|olate; and, though the room had &s;till a &s;olemn a&s;pect, from its &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s and the narrowne&s;s of the windows, it was not uncomfortable.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t night that Adeline retired hither, &s;he &s;lept little: the &s;olitary air of the place affected her &s;pirits; the more &s;o, perhaps, becau&s;e &s;he had, with friendly con&s;ideration, endea|voured to &s;upport them in the pre&s;ence of Madame La Motte. She remembered the narrative of Peter, &s;everal circum&s;tances of which had impre&s;&s;ed her imagination in &s;pite of her rea&s;on, and &s;he found it difficult wholly to &s;ubdue apprehen&s;ion. At one time, terror &s;o &s;trongly &s;eized her mind, that &s;he had even opened the door with an intention of calling Madame La Mot|te; but, li&s;tening for a moment on the &s;tairs of the tower every thing &s;eemed &s;till; at length &s;he heard the voice of La Motte &s;peaking cheerfully, and the ab&s;urdity of her fears &s;truck her forcibly; &s;he blu&s;hed that &s;he had for a moment &s;ubmitted to them, and returned to her chamber wondering at her&s;elf.</P>

<P>LA Motte arrainged his little plan of living. His morn|ings were u&s;ually &s;pent in &s;hooting, or fi&s;hing, and the dinner thus provided by his indu&s;try, he reli&s;hed with a keener appetite than had ever attended him at the luxurious tables of Paris. The afternoons he pa&s;&s;ed with his family: &s;ometimes he would &s;elect a book from the few he had brought with him, and endea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oured to fix his attention to the words his lips re|peated:&mdash;but his mind &s;uffered little ab&s;traction from its own cares, and the &s;entiment he pronounced left no trace behind it. Sometimes he conver&s;ed, but oftener &s;at in gloomy &s;ilence, mu&s;ing upon the pa&s;t, or anticipating the future.</P>
<P>At the&s;e moments, Adeline, with a &s;weetne&s;s almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;t|ible, endeavoured to enliven his &s;pirits, and to withdraw him from him&s;elf. Seldom &s;he &s;ucceeded, but when &s;he did, the grateful looks of Madame La Motte, and the benevolent feel|ings of her own bo&s;om, realized the cheerfulne&s;s &s;he had at fir&s;t only a&s;&s;umed. Adeline's mind had the happy art, or, perhaps, it were more ju&s;t to &s;ay the happy nature, of accommodating it&s;elf to her &s;ituation. Her pre&s;ent condition, though forlorn, was not devoid of comfort, and this comfort was confirmed by her virtue. So much &s;he won upon the affections of her pro|tectors, that Madame La Motte loved her as her child, and La Motte him&s;elf, though a man little &s;u&s;ceptible of tenderne&s;s, could not be in&s;en&s;ible to her &s;olicitudes. Whenever he relaxed from the &s;ullenne&s;s of mi&s;ery, it was at the influence of Adeline.</P>
<P>Peter regularly brought a weekly &s;upply of provi&s;ions from Auboine, and, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, always quitted the town by a route contrary to that leading to the abbey. Several weeks having pa&s;&s;ed without mole&s;tation, La Motte di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all ap|prehen&s;ion of pur&s;uit, and at length became tolerably recon|ciled to the complection of his circum&s;tances. As habit and effort &s;trengthened the fortitude of Madame La Motte, the
<PB N="34" REF="029379_0018_0FE089B0F9422C30">
features of misfortune appeared to &s;often. The fore&s;t, which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t &s;eemed to her a frightful &s;olitude, had lo&s;t its terrific a&s;|pect; and that edifice, who&s;e half demoli&s;hed walls and gloomy de&s;olation had &s;truck her mind with the force of melan|choly and di&s;may, was now beheld as a dome&s;tic a&s;ylum, and a &s;afe refuge from the &s;torms of power.</P>
<P>She was a &s;en&s;ible and highly accompli&s;hed woman, and it became her chief delight to form the ri&s;ing graces of Adeline, who had as has been already &s;hown, a &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which made her quick to repay in&s;truction with improvement, and indulgence with love. Never was Adeline &s;o plea&s;ed as when &s;he anticipated her wi&s;hes, and never &s;o diligent as when &s;he was employed in her bu&s;ine&s;s. The lit|tle affairs of the hou&s;hold &s;he overlooked and managed with &s;uch admirable exactne&s;s, that Madame La Motte had neither anxiety, nor care, concerning them. And Adeline formed for her&s;elf in this barren &s;ituation, many amu&s;ements, that oc|ca&s;ionally bani&s;hed the remembrance of her misfortunes. La Motte's books were her chief con&s;olation. With one of the&s;e &s;he would frequently ramble into the fore&s;t, where the river winding through a glade, diffu&s;ed coolne&s;s, and with its mur|muring accents, invited repo&s;e: there &s;he would &s;eat her&s;elf, and re&s;igned to the illu&s;ions of the page, pa&s;s many hours in oblivion of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Here too when her mind was tranquilized by the &s;urround|ing &s;cenery, &s;he wooed the gentle mu&s;e, and indulged in ideal hippine&s;s. The delight of the&s;e moments &s;he commem|orated in the following addre&s;s

Adeline had given a brief account of the manner in which &s;he had been brought thither, but had always with tears intreated to be &s;pared for that time from a particular relation of her hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Her &s;pirits were not then equal to retro&s;pection, but now that they were &s;oothed by quiet, and &s;trengthened by confi|dence, &s;he one day gave Madame La Motte the following narration.</P>
<P>I am the only child, &s;aid Adeline, of Louis de St. Pierre, a chevalier of reputable family, but of &s;mall fortune, who for many years re&s;ided at Paris. Of my mother I have a faint remembrance; I lo&s;t her when I was only &s;even years old, and this was my fir&s;t misfortune. At her death, my father gave up hou&s;e keeping, boarded me in a convent and quitted Paris. Thus was I, at this early period of my life, abandoned to &s;tran|gers. My father came &s;ometimes to Paris; he then vi&s;ited me and I well remember the grief I u&s;ed to feel when he bade me farewell. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, which rung my heart with grief, he appeared unmoved; &s;o that I often thought he had little tenderne&s;s for me. But he was my father; and the only per&s;on to whom I could look up for protection, and love.</P>
<P>In this convent I continued till I was twelve years old. A thou&s;and times I had entreated my father to take me home, but at fir&s;t motives of prudence and afterwards of avarice prevented him. I was now removed from this conven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and placed in another, where I learned my father intended I &s;hould take the veil. I will not attempt to expre&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e and grief on this occa&s;ion. Too long I had been imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed in the walls of a cloi&s;ter, and too much had I &s;een of the &s;ullen mi&s;|ery of its votaries, not to feel horror and di&s;gu&s;t at the pro&s;|pect of being added to their number.</P>
<P>The Lady Abbe&s;s was a woman of rigid decorum and &s;e|vere devotion; exact in the ob&s;ervance of every detail of form, and never forgave an offence again&s;t ceremony. It was her method when &s;he wanted to make converts to her order, to denounce and terrify rather than to per&s;uade and allure. Her's were the arts of cunning practi&s;ed upon fear, not tho&s;e of &s;ophi&s;tication upon rea&s;on. She employed numberle&s;s &s;tra|tagems
<PB N="36" REF="029379_0019_0FE089B5B25DB510">
to gain me to her purpo&s;e, and they all wore the complection of her character. But in the life to which &s;he would have devoted me, I &s;aw too many forms of real ter|ror, to be overcome by the influenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of her ideal ho&s;t, and was re&s;olute in rejecting the veil. Here I pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years of mi&s;erable re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t cruelty and &s;uper&s;tition. My father I &s;eldom &s;aw; when I did, I entreated him to al|ter my de&s;tination, but he objected that his fortune was in&s;uf|ficient to &s;upport me in the world, and at length denounced vengeance on my head if I per&s;i&s;ted in di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>You, my dear Madam, can form little idea of the wretch|edne&s;s of my &s;ituation, condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment, and impri&s;onment of the mo&s;t dreadful kind, or to the ven|geance of a father, from whom I had no appeal. My re&s;olu|tion relaxed&mdash;for &s;ome time I pau&s;ed upon the choice of evils&mdash;but at length the horrors of the mona&s;tic life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e &s;o fully to my view, that fortitude gave way before them. Ex|cluded from the cheerful intercour&s;e of &s;ociety&mdash;from the plea&s;ant view of nature&mdash;almo&s;t from the light of day&mdash;con|demned to &s;ilence&mdash;rigid formality&mdash;ab&s;tinence and penance&mdash; condemned to forego the delights of a world, which imagi|nation painted in the gaye&s;t and mo&s;t alluring colours, and who&s;e hues were, perhaps, not the le&s;s captivating becau&s;e they were only ideal&mdash;&s;uch was the &s;tate, to which I was de&s;tined. Again my re&s;olution was invigorated: my father's cruelty &s;ubdued tenderne&s;s, and rou&s;ed indignation. "Since he can forget, &s;aid I, the affection of a parent, and condemn his child without remor&s;e to wretchedne&s;s and de&s;pair&mdash;the bond of filial and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ential duty no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between us&mdash;he has him&s;elf di&s;&s;olved it, and I will yet &s;truggle for liberty and life."</P>
<P>Finding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e unmoved by menace, the Lady Abbe&s;s had now recour&s;e to more &s;ubtle mea&s;ures: &s;he conde&s;cended to &s;mile, and even to flatter; but her's was the di&s;torted &s;mile, of cunning, not the gracious emblem of kindne&s;s; it provoked di&s;gu&s;t, in&s;tead of in&s;piring affection. She painted the char|acter of a ve&s;tal in the mo&s;t beautiful tints of art&mdash;its holy innocence&mdash;its mild dignity; its &s;ublime devotion. I &s;ighed as &s;he &s;poke. This &s;he regarded as a favourable &s;ymptom, and proceeded on her picture with more animation.

<P><PB N="37" REF="029379_0019_0FE089B5B25DB510">So highly &s;he fini&s;hed the piece, that the lurking lines of cunning would, to an inexperienced eye, have e&s;caped detec|tion. Mine was too &s;orrowfully informed. Too often had I witne&s;&s;ed the &s;ecret tear and bur&s;ting &s;igh of vain regret, the &s;ullen pinings of di&s;content, and the mute angui&s;h of de&s;|pair. My &s;ilence and my manner a&s;&s;ured her of my incredu|lity, and it was with difficulty that &s;he pre&s;erved a decent compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>My father, as may be imagined, was highly incen&s;ed at my per&s;everance, which he called ob&s;tinacy, but, what will not be &s;o ea&s;ily believed, he &s;oon after relented, and appointed a day to take me from the convent. O! judge of my feelings when I received this intelligence. The joy it occa&s;ioned awakened all my gratitude; I forgot the former cruelty of my father, and that the pre&s;ent indulgence was le&s;s the effect of his kindne&s;s than of my re&s;olution. I wept that I could not indulge his every wi&s;h.</P>
<P>What days of bli&s;sful expectation were tho&s;e that preceded my departure! The world, from which I had been hitherto &s;ecluded&mdash;The world, in which my fancy had been &s;o often delighted to roam&mdash;who&s;e paths were &s;trewn with fadele&s;s ro&s;es&mdash;who&s;e every &s;cene &s;miled in beauty and invited to de|light&mdash;where all the people were good, and all the good happy&mdash;Ah! <HI>then</HI> that world was bur&s;ting upon my view. Let me catch the rapturous remembrance before it vani&s;h! It is like the pa&s;&s;ing lights of autumn, that gleam for a moment on a hill, and then leave it to darkne&s;s. I counted the days and hours that withheld me from this fairy land. It was in the convent only that people were deceitful and cruel: it was there only that mi&s;ery dwelt. I was quitting it all! How I pitied the poor nuns that were to be left behind. I would have given half that world I prized &s;o much, had it been mine, to have taken them out with me.</P>
<P>The long wi&s;hed for day at la&s;t arrived. My father came, and for a moment my joy was lo&s;t in the &s;orrow of bid|ding farewell to my poor companions, for whom I had never felt &s;uch warmth of kindne&s;s as at this in&s;tant. I was &s;oon beyond the gates of the convent. I looked around me, and viewed the va&s;t vault of heaven no longer bounded by mona|&s;tic walls, and the green earth extended in hill and da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the round verge of the horizon! My heart danced with delight, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ears &s;welled in my eyes, and for &s;ome moments I was unable

to &s;peak. My thoughts ro&s;e to Heaven in &s;entiments of gra|titude to the Giver of all good!</P>
<P>At lengeh, I returned to my father; dear Sir, &s;aid I, how I thank you for my deliverance, and how I wi&s;h I could do ev|ery thing to oblige you.</P>
<P>Return, then, to your convent, &s;aid he, in a har&s;h accent. I &s;huddered; his look and manner jarred the tone of my feel|ings; they &s;truck di&s;cord upon my heart, which had before re&s;ponded only to harmony. The ardour of joy was in a mo|ment repre&s;&s;ed, and every object around me was &s;addened with the gloom of di&s;appointment. It was not that I &s;u&s;pec|ted my father would take me back to the convent; but that his feelings &s;eemed &s;o very di&s;&s;onant of the joy and gratitude which I had but a moment before felt and expre&s;&s;ed to him.&mdash; Pardon, Madame a relation of the&s;e trivial circum&s;tances; the &s;trong vici&s;&s;itudes of feeling which they impre&s;&s;ed upon my heart, make me think them important, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they are, per|haps, only di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>"No, my dear," &s;aid Madame La Motte, they are intere&s;t|ing to me, they illu&s;trate little traits of character, which I love to ob&s;erve. You are worthy of all my regards, and from this moment I give my tendere&s;t pity to your misfortunes, and my affection to your goodne&s;s."</P>
<P>The&s;e words melted the heart of Adeline; &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the hand which Madame held out, and remained a few minutes &s;ilent. At length &s;he &s;aid, "May I de&s;erve this goodne&s;s and may I ever be thankful to God, who, in giving me &s;uch a friend, has rai&s;ed me to comfort and hope!</P>
<P>"My father's hou&s;e was &s;ituated a few leagues on the other &s;ide of Paris, and in our way to it, we pa&s;&s;ed through that city. What a novel &s;cene! Where were now the &s;olemn faces, the demure manners I had been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee in the convent? Every countenance was here animated either by bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure; every &s;tep was airy, and every &s;mile was gay. All the people appeared like friends; they looked and &s;miled at me; I &s;miled again, and wi&s;hed to have told them how plea&s;ed I was. How delightful, &s;aid I, to live &s;urrounded by friends!</P>
<P>"What crowded &s;treets! What magnificent hotels! What &s;plendid equipages! I &s;carcely ob&s;erved that the &s;treets were narrow, or the way dangerous.

my gratitude to my father, but his looks forbade me, and I was &s;ilent. I am too diffu&s;e; even the faint forms which memo|ry reflects of pa&s;&s;ed delight are grateful to the heart. The &s;hadow of plea&s;ure is &s;till gazed upon with a melancholy en|joyment, though the &s;ub&s;tance is fled beyond our reach."</P>
<P>"Having quitted Paris, which I left with many &s;ighs, and gazed upon till the towers of every church di&s;&s;olved in di&s;tance from my view; we entered upon a gloomy and unfrequented road. It was evening when we reached a wild heath; I look|ed round in &s;earch of a human dwelling, but could find none; and not a human being was to be &s;een. I experienced &s;ome|thing of what I u&s;ed to feel in the convent; my heart had not been &s;o &s;ad &s;ince I left it. Of my father, who &s;till &s;at in &s;i|lence, I inquired if we were near home; he an&s;wered in the affirmative. Night came on, however, before we reached the place of our de&s;tination; it was a lone hou&s;e on the wa&s;te; but I need not de&s;cribe it to you, Madame. When the carriage &s;topped, two men appeared at the door, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted us to alight; &s;o gloomy were their countenances and &s;o few their words, I almo&s;t fancied my&s;elf again in the convent. Certain it is, I had not &s;een &s;uch melancholy faces &s;ince I quitted it. Is this a part of the world I have &s;o fondly contemplated? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"The interior appearance of the hou&s;e was de&s;olate and mean; I was &s;urpri&s;ed that my father had cho&s;en &s;uch a place for his habitation, and al&s;o that no woman was to be &s;een; but I knew that inquiry would only produce a reproof, and was therefore &s;ilent. At &s;upper, the two men I had before &s;een &s;at down with us; they &s;aid little, but &s;eemed to ob&s;erve me much. I was confu&s;ed and di&s;plea&s;ed, which, my father noticing, frowned at them with a look, which convinced me he meant more than I comprehended. When the cloth was drawn, my father took my hand and conducted me to the door of my chamber; having &s;et down the candle, and wi&s;hed me good night, he left me to my own &s;olitary thoughts.</P>
<P>"How different were they from tho&s;e I had indulged a few hours before! then expectation, hope, delight, danced before me; now melancholy and di&s;appointment chilled the ardour of my mind, and di&s;coloured my future pro&s;pect. The ap|pearance of every thing around conduced to depre&s;s me. On the floor lay a &s;mall bed without curtains, or hangings; two old chairs and a table were all the remaining furniture in the room. I went to the window, with an intention of looking
<PB N="40" REF="029379_0021_0FE089CC1106FA70">
out upon the &s;urrounding &s;cene, and found it was grated, I was &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ked at this circum&s;tance, and, comparing it with the lonely &s;ituation, and the &s;trange appearance of the hou&s;e, to|gether with the countenances and behaviour of the men, who had &s;upped with us, I was lo&s;t in a labyrinth of conjecture.</P>
<P>"At length I lay down to &s;leep; but the anxiety of my mind prevented repo&s;e, gloomy, unplea&s;ing images flitted be|fore my fancy, and I fell into a &s;ort of waking dream: I thought that I was in a lonely fore&s;t with my father; his looks were &s;evere, and his ge&s;tures menacing: he upbraided me for leaving the convent, and while he &s;poke, drew from his pock|et a mirror, which he held before my face; I looked in it and &s;aw, (my blood now thrills as I repeat it) I &s;aw my&s;elf woun|ded, and bleeding profu&s;ely. Then I thought my&s;elf in the hou&s;e again; and &s;uddenly heard the&s;e words, in accents &s;o di&s;tinct, that for &s;ome time after I awoke, I could &s;carcely be|lieve them ideal, "Depart this hou&s;e, de&s;truction hovers here."</P>
<P>"I was awakened by a foot&s;tep on the &s;tairs; it was my father retiring to his chamber; the latene&s;s of the hour &s;ur|pri&s;ed me, for it was pa&s;t midnight.</P>
<P>"On the following morning, the party of the preceding evening a&s;&s;embled at breakfa&s;t, and were as gloomy and &s;ilent as before. The table was &s;pread by a boy of my father's; but the cook and the hou&s;e-maid, whatever they might be were invi&s;ible."</P>
<P>"The next morning, I was &s;urpri&s;ed, on attempting to leave my chamber, to find the door locked; I waited a con|&s;iderable time before I ventured to call; when I did, no an|&s;wer was returned; I then went to the window, and called more loudly, but my own voice was &s;till the only &s;ound I heard. Near an hour I pa&s;&s;ed in a &s;tate of &s;urpri&s;e and ter|ror not to be de&s;cribed: at length, I heard a per&s;on coming up &s;tai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and I renewed the call; I was an&s;wered, that my father had that morning &s;at off for Paris, whence he would return in a few days; in the mean while he had ordered me to be confined in my chamber. On my expre&s;&s;ing &s;urpri&s;e and apprehen&s;ion at this circum&s;tance, I was a&s;&s;ured I had nothing to fear, and that I &s;hould live as well as if I was at liberty."</P>
<P>"The latter part of this &s;peech &s;eemed to contain an odd kind of comfort; I made little reply, but &s;ubmitted to ne|ce&s;&s;ity. Once more I was abandoned to &s;orrowful reflection; what a day was the one I now pa&s;&s;ed! alone, and agitated
<PB N="41" REF="029379_0021_0FE089CC1106FA70">
with grief and apprehen&s;ion. I endeavoured to conjecture the cau&s;e of this har&s;h treatment; and, at length concluded it was de&s;igned by my father, as a puni&s;hment for my former di&s;obedience. But why abandon me to the power of &s;trang|ers, to men, who&s;e countenances bore the &s;tamp of villany &s;o &s;trongly as to impre&s;s even my inexperienced mind with ter|ror! Surmi&s;e involved me only deeper in perplexity, yet I found it impo&s;&s;ible to forbear pur&s;uing the &s;ubject; and the day was divided between lamentation and conjecture. Night at length came, and &s;uch a night! Darkne&s;s brought new terrors: I looked round the chamber for &s;ome means of fa&s;t|ening my door on the in&s;ide, but could perceive none; at la&s;t I contrived to place the back of a chair in an oblique di|rection, &s;o as to render it &s;ecure.</P>
<P>"I had &s;carcely done this, and laid down upon my bed in my clothes, not to &s;leep, but to watch, when I heard a rap at the door of the hou&s;e, which was opened and &s;hut &s;o quickly, that the per&s;on who had knocked, &s;eemed only to deliver a letter or me&s;&s;age. Soon after, I heard voices at intervals in a room below &s;tairs, &s;ometimes &s;peaking very low, and &s;ome|times ri&s;ing, all together, as if in di&s;pute. Something more excu&s;able than curio&s;ity made me endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h what was &s;aid, but in vain; now and then a word or two reached me, and once I heard my name repeated, but no more."</P>
<P>"Thus pa&s;&s;ed the hours till midnight, when all became &s;till. I had laid for &s;ome time in a &s;tate between fear and hope, when I heard the lock of my door gently moved backward and forward; I &s;tarted up, and li&s;tened; for a moment it was &s;till, then the noi&s;e returned, and I heard a whi&s;pering with|out; my &s;pirits died away, but I was yet &s;en&s;ible. Pre&s;ently an effort was made at the door, as if to force it; I &s;hrieked aloud, and immediately heard the voices of the men I had &s;een at my father's table: they called loudly for the door to be opened, and on my returning no an&s;wer, uttered dreadful exe|crations. I had ju&s;t &s;trength &s;ufficient to move to the window, in the de&s;perate hope of e&s;caping thence; but my feeble efforts could not even &s;hake the bars. O! how can I recollect the&s;e moments of horror, and be &s;ufficiently thankful that I am now in &s;afety and comfort!</P>
<P>"They remained &s;ome time at the door, then they quit|ted it, and went down &s;tairs. How my heart revived at ev|ery &s;tep of their departure; I fell upon my knees, thanked
<PB N="42" REF="029379_0022_0FE089D81E4AE5E8">
God that he had pre&s;erved me this time, and implored his farther protection. I was ri&s;ing from this &s;hort prayer, when &s;uddenly I heard a noi&s;e in a different part of the ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, and on looking round, I perceived the door of a &s;mall clo&s;et, open, and two men enter the chamber.</P>
<P>"They &s;eized me, and I &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s in their arms; how long I remained in this condition I know not, but on reviving, I perceived my&s;elf again alone, and heard &s;everal voices from below &s;tairs, I had pre&s;ence of mind to run to the door of the clo&s;et, my only chance of e&s;cape: but it was locked! I then recollected it was po&s;&s;ible, that the ruffians might have forgot to turn the key of the chamber door, which was held by the chair; but here, al&s;o, I was di&s;appointed. I cla&s;ped my hands in an agony of de&s;pair, and &s;tood for &s;ome time immovable.</P>
<P>"A violent noi&s;e from below rou&s;ed me, and &s;oon after I heard people a&s;cending the &s;tairs: I now gave my&s;elf up for lo&s;t. The &s;teps approached, the door of the clo&s;et was again unlocked. I &s;tood calmly, and again &s;aw the men enter the chamber; I neither &s;poke nor re&s;i&s;ted: the faculties of my &s;oul were wrought up beyond the power of feeling; as a vio|lent blow on the body &s;tuns for a while the &s;en&s;e of pain. They led me down &s;tairs; the door of a room below was thrown open, and I beheld a &s;tranger; it was then that my &s;en&s;es returned; I &s;hrieked and re&s;i&s;ted, but was forced along. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that this &s;tranger was Mon&s;ieur La Mot|te, or to add, that I &s;hall for ever ble&s;s him as my deliverer."</P>
<P>Adeline cea&s;ed to &s;peak; Madame La Motte remained &s;i|lent. There were &s;ome circum&s;tances in Adeline's narrative, which rai&s;ed all her curio&s;ity. She a&s;ked if Adeline believed her father to be a party in this my&s;terious affair. Adeline, thought it was impo&s;&s;ible to doubt that he had been princi|pally and materially concerned in &s;ome part of it, thought, or &s;aid &s;he thought, he was innocent of any intention again&s;t her life. "Yet, what motive." &s;aid Madame La Motte, "could there be for a degree of cruelty &s;o apparently unprofitable?" Here the inquiry ended; and Adeline confe&s;&s;ed &s;he had pur|&s;ued it, till her mind &s;hrunk from all farther re&s;earch.</P>
<P>The &s;ympathy which &s;uch uncommon misfortune excited, Madame La Motte now expre&s;&s;ed without re&s;erve, and this ex|pre&s;&s;ion of it, &s;trengthened the tye of mutual friend&s;hip Ad|eline felt her &s;pirit relieved by the di&s;clo&s;ure &s;he had made to Madame La Motte; and the latter acknowledged the value of the confidence, by an increa&s;e of affectionate attentions.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LA Motte had now pa&s;&s;ed above a month in this &s;eclu&s;ion; and his wife had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee him recover tranquillity and even cheerfulne&s;s. In this plea&s;ure Adeline warmly par|ticipated; and &s;he might ju&s;tly have congratulated her&s;elf, as one cau&s;e of his re&s;toration; her cheerfulne&s;s and delicate at|tention had affected what Madame La Motte's greater anxiety had failed to accompli&s;h. La Motte did not &s;eem regardle&s;s of her amiable di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ometimes thanked her in a man|ner more earne&s;t than was u&s;ual with him. She, in her turn, con&s;idered him as her only protector, and now felt to|wards him the affection of a daughter.</P>
<P>The time &s;he had &s;pent in this peaceful retirement had &s;of|tened the remembrance of pa&s;t events, and re&s;tored her mind to its natural tone; and when memory brought back to her view her former &s;hort and romantic expectations of happine&s;s, though &s;he gave a &s;igh to the rapturous illu&s;ion, &s;he le&s;s lamented the di&s;|appointment, than rejoiced in her pre&s;ent &s;ecurity and comfort.</P>
<P>But the &s;atisfaction which La Motte's cheerfulne&s;s diffu&s;ed around him was of &s;hort continuance; he became &s;uddenly gloomy and re&s;erved; the &s;ociety of his family was no longer grateful to him; and he would &s;pend whole hours in the mo&s;t &s;ecluded parts of the fore&s;t, devoted to melancholy and &s;ecret grief. He did not, as formerly, indulge the humour of his &s;adne&s;s, without re&s;traint, in the pre&s;ence of others; he now evidently endeavoured to conceal it, and affected a cheerfulne&s;s that was too artificial to e&s;cape detection.</P>
<P>His &s;ervant Peter either impelled by curio&s;ity or kindne&s;s, &s;ometimes followed him un&s;een into the fore&s;t. He ob&s;erved him frequently retire to one particular &s;pot, in a remote part, which having gained, he always di&s;appeared before Peter,
<PB N="44" REF="029379_0023_0FE089DE0F52ED88">
who was obliged to follow at a di&s;tance, could exactly notice, where. All his endeavours, now prompted by wonder and in|vigorated by di&s;appointment, were un&s;ucce&s;sful, and he was at length compelled to endure the tortures of un&s;atisfied curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>This change in the manners and habits of her hu&s;band was too con&s;picuous to pa&s;s unob&s;erved by Madame La Motte, who endeavoured, by all the &s;tratagems which affection could &s;ugge&s;t, or female invention &s;upply, to win him to her confi|dence. He &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible to the influence of the fir&s;t, and with&s;tood the wiles of the latter. Finding all her efforts in|&s;ufficient to di&s;&s;ipate the glooms which overhung his mind, or to penetrate their &s;ecret cau&s;e, &s;he de&s;i&s;ted from farther attempt, and endeavoured to &s;ubmit to this my&s;terious di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Week after week elap&s;ed, and the &s;ame unknown cau&s;e &s;eal|ed the lips and corroded the heart of La Motte. The place of his vi&s;itation in the fore&s;t had not been traced. Peter had frequently examined round the &s;pot where his ma&s;ter di&s;ap|peared, but had never di&s;covered any rece&s;s which could be &s;uppo&s;ed to conceal him. The a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;ervant was at length rai&s;ed to an in&s;upportable degree, and he com|municated to his mi&s;tre&s;s the &s;ubject of it.</P>
<P>The emotion, which this information excited, &s;he di&s;gui&s;ed from Peter, and reproved him for the means he had taken to gratify his curio&s;ity. But &s;he revolved this circum&s;tance in her thoughts, and comparing it with the late alteration in his tem|per, her unea&s;ine&s;s was renewed, and her perplexity con&s;idera|bly increa&s;ed. After much con&s;ideration, being unable to a&s;|&s;ign any other motive for his conduct, &s;he began to attribute it to the influence of illicit pa&s;&s;ion; and her heart, which now out-ran her judgment, confirmed the &s;uppo&s;ition, and rou&s;ed all the torturing pangs of jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Comparatively &s;peaking, &s;he had never known affliction till now: &s;he had abandoned her deare&s;t friends and connections&mdash; had relinqui&s;hed the gaieties, the luxuries, and almo&s;t the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life;&mdash;fled with her family into exile, an exile the mo&s;t dreary and comfortle&s;s; experiencing the evils of reali|ty, and tho&s;e of apprehen&s;ion, united: all the&s;e &s;he had patient|ly endured, &s;upported by the affection of him, for who&s;e &s;ake &s;he &s;uffered. Though that affection, indeed, had for &s;ome time appeared to be abated, &s;he had borne its decrea&s;e with fortitude: but the la&s;t &s;troke of calamity, hitherto withheld, now came with irre&s;i&s;tible force&mdash;the love of which &s;he la|mented the lo&s;s, &s;he now believed was transferred to another.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="029379_0023_0FE089DE0F52ED88">The operation of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion confu&s;es the powers of rea|&s;on, and warps them on its own particular direction. Her u&s;ual degree of judgment, unoppo&s;ed by the influence of her heart, would probably have pointed out to Madame La Motte &s;ome circum&s;tances upon the &s;ubject of her di&s;tre&s;s, equivocal, if not contradictory to her &s;u&s;picions. No &s;uch circum&s;tances appeared to her, and &s;he did not long he&s;itate to decide, that Adeline was the object of her hu&s;band's attachment. Her beauty out of the que&s;tion, who el&s;e, indeed, could it be in a &s;pot thus &s;ecluded from the world?</P>
<P>The &s;ame cau&s;e de&s;troyed, almo&s;t at the &s;ame moment, her only remaining comfort; and, when &s;he wept that &s;he could no longer look for happine&s;s in the affection of La Motte, &s;he wept al&s;o, that &s;he could no longer &s;eek &s;olace in the friend|&s;hip of Adeline. She had too great an e&s;teem for her to doubt, at fir&s;t, the integrity of her conduct, but, in &s;pite of rea&s;on, her heart no longer expanded to her with its u&s;ual warmth of kindne&s;s. She &s;hrunk from her confidence; and as the &s;ecret broodings of jealou&s;y cheri&s;hed her &s;u&s;picions, &s;he became le&s;s kind to her, even in manner.</P>

She therefore, in|crea&s;ed her a&s;&s;iduities; but, perceiving, contrary to all expect|ation, that her efforts to plea&s;e failed of their u&s;ual con&s;e|quence, and that the re&s;erve of Madame's manner rather increa&s;ed than abated, &s;he became &s;eriou&s;ly unea&s;y, and re&s;olved to &s;eek an explanation. This Madame La Motte as &s;edulou&s;ly avoided, and was for &s;ome time able to prevent. Adeline, however, too much intere&s;ted in the event to yield to delicate &s;cruples pre&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject &s;o clo&s;ely, that Madame, at fir&s;t agitated and confu&s;ed, at length invented &s;ome idle ex|cu&s;e, and laughed off the affair.</P>
<P>She now &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubduing all appearance of re&s;erve towards Adeline; and though her art could not con|quer the prejudices of pa&s;&s;ion, it taught her to a&s;&s;ume, with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s, the a&s;pect of kindne&s;s. Adeline was de|ceived, and was again at peace. Indeed, confidence in the &s;incerity and goodne&s;s of others was her weakne&s;s. But the pangs of &s;tifled jealou&s;y &s;truck deeper to the heart of Madame La Motte, and &s;he re&s;olved, at all events, to obtain &s;ome cer|tainty upon the &s;ubject of her &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="029379_0024_0FE089EDB485E470">She now conde&s;cended to a meanne&s;s, which &s;he had before de&s;pi&s;ed, and ordered Peter to watch the &s;teps of his ma&s;ter, in order to di&s;cover, if po&s;&s;ible, the place of his vi&s;itation! So much did pa&s;&s;ion win upon her judgment, by time and indul|gence, that &s;he &s;ometimes ventured even to doubt the integrity of Adeline, and afterwards proceeded to believe it po&s;&s;ible that the object of La Motte's rambles might be an a&s;&s;ignation with her. What &s;ugge&s;ted this conjecture was, that Adeline frequently took long walks alone in the fore&s;t, and &s;ometimes was ab&s;ent from the abbey for many hours. This circum|&s;tance, which Madame La Motte had at fir&s;t attributed to Adeline's fondne&s;s for the picture&s;que beauties of nature, now operated forcibly upon her imagination, and &s;he could view it in no other light, than as affording an opportunity for &s;ecret conver&s;ation with her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Peter obeyed the orders of his mi&s;tre&s;s with alacrity, for they were warmly &s;econded by his own curio&s;ity. All his endea|vours were, however, fruitle&s;s; he never dared to follow La Motte near enough to ob&s;erve the place of his la&s;t retreat. Her impatience thus heightened by delay, and her pa&s;&s;ion &s;tim|ulated by difficulty, Madame La Motte now re&s;olved to ap|ply to her hu&s;band for an explanation of his conduct.</P>
<P>After &s;ome con&s;ideration, concerning the manner mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed with him, &s;he went to La Motte, but when &s;he entered the room where he &s;at, forgetting all her concerted addre&s;s, &s;he fell at his feet, and was, for &s;ome moments, lo&s;t in tears. Surpri&s;ed at her attitude and di&s;tre&s;s, he inquired the occa&s;ion of it, and was an&s;wered, that it was cau&s;ed by his own conduct. "My conduct! What part of it, pray? inquired he.</P>
<P>"Your re&s;erve, your &s;ecret &s;orrow, and frequent ab&s;cence from the abbey."</P>
<P>"Is it then &s;o wonderful, that a man, who has lo&s;t almo&s;t every thing, &s;hould &s;ometimes lament his misfortunes? or &s;o criminal to attempt concealing his grief, that he mu&s;t be blamed for it by tho&s;e, whom he would &s;ave from the pain of &s;haring it?"</P>
<P>Having uttered the&s;e words, he quitted the room, leaving Madame La Motte lo&s;t in &s;urprize, but &s;omewhat relieved from the pre&s;&s;ure of her former &s;u&s;picions. Still, however, &s;he, pur&s;ued Adeline with an eye of &s;crutiny; and the ma&s;k of kindne&s;s would &s;ometimes fall off, and di&s;cover the fea|tures

of di&s;tru&s;t. Adeline, without exactly knowing why, felt le&s;s at ea&s;e and le&s;s happy in her pre&s;ence than formerly; her &s;pirits drooped, and &s;he would often, when alone, weep at the forlornne&s;s of her condition. Formerly, her remembrance of pa&s;t &s;ufferings was lo&s;t in the friend&s;hip of Madame La Motte; now, though her behaviour was too guarded to betray any &s;triking in&s;tance of unkindne&s;s, there was &s;omething in her manner which chilled the hopes of Adeline, unable as &s;he was to analyze it. But a circum&s;tance, which &s;oon occurred, &s;u&s;pended, for a while, the jealou&s;y of Madame La Motte, and rou&s;ed her hu&s;band from his &s;tate of gloomy &s;tupefaction.</P>
<P>Peter, having been one day to Auboine, for the weekly &s;upply of provi&s;ions, returned with intelligence that awakened in La Motte new apprehen&s;ion and anxiety.</P>
<P>"Oh, Sir, I've heard &s;omething that has a&s;toni&s;hed me, as well it may, "cried Peter," and &s;o it will you, when you come to know it. As I was &s;tanding in the black&s;mith's &s;hop, while the &s;mith was driving a nail into the hor&s;e's &s;hoe (by the bye, the hor&s;e lo&s;t it in an odd way, I'll tell you, Sir, how it was)"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Nay, prithee leave it till another time, and go on with your &s;tory?"</P>
<P>"Why then, Sir, as I was &s;tanding in the black&s;mith's &s;hop, comes in a man with a pipe in his mouth, and a large pouch of tobacco in his hand"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Well&mdash;what has the pipe to do with the &s;tory?"</P>
<P>"Nay, Sir, you put me out; I can't go on, unle&s;s you let me tell it my own way. As I was &s;aying &mdash; with a pipe in his mouth&mdash;I think I was there, your Honour!"</P>
<P>"Yes, yes."</P>
<P>"He &s;et him&s;elf down on the bench, and, taking the pipe from his mouth, &s;ays to the black&s;mith&mdash;Neighbour, do you know any body of the name of La Motte hereabouts?&mdash;Ble&s;s your Honour, I turned all of a cold &s;weat in a minute! Is not your Honour well, &s;hall I fetch you any thing?</P>
<P>"No&mdash;but be &s;hort in your narrative."</P>
<P>"La Motte! La Motte! &s;aid the black&s;mith, I think I've heard the name." &mdash; "Have you?" &s;aid I, "you're cunning then, for there's no &s;uch per&s;on hereabouts, to my knowledge."</P>
<P>"Fool! why did you &s;ay that?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e I did not want them to know your Honour was here; and if I had not managed very cleverly, they would

have found me out. There is no &s;uch per&s;on, hereabouts, to my knowledge," &s;ays I.&mdash;"Indeed! &s;ays the black&s;mith, you know more of the neighbourhood than I do thee."&mdash;"Aye," ays the man with the pipe "that's very true. How came you to know &s;o much of the neighbourhood? I came here twenty-&s;ix years ago, come next St. Michael, and you know more than I do. How came you to know &s;o much?"</P>
<P>"With that he put his pipe in his mouth, and gave a whiff full in my face. Lord! your Honour, I trembled from head to foot. Nay, as for that matter, &s;ays I, I don't know more than other people, but I'm &s;ure I never heard of &s;uch a man as that."&mdash;Pray, &s;ays the black&s;mith, &s;taring me full in the face, an't you the man that was inquiring &s;ome time &s;ince about St. Clair's Abbey?"&mdash;"Well, what of that? &s;ays I, what does that prove?"&mdash;Why, they &s;ay, &s;omebody lives in the abbey now, &s;aid the man, turning to the other; and, for aught I know it may be this &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me La Motte."&mdash;"Aye, or for ought I know either &s;ays the man with the pipe, getting up from the bench, and you know more of this than you'll own. I'll lay my life on't, this Mon&s;ieur La Motte lives at the abbey,"&mdash;Aye, &s;ays I, you are out there, for he does not live at the abbey now."</P>
<P>"Confound your folly!" cried La Motte, but be quick&mdash; how did the matter end?"</P>
<P>"My ma&s;ter does not live there now, &s;aid I.&mdash;Oh! oh! &s;aid the man with the pipe; he is your ma&s;ter, then? And pray how long has he left the abbey&mdash;and where does he live now? Hold &s;aid I, not &s;o fa&s;t&mdash;I know when to &s;peak and when to hold my tongue&mdash;but who has been inquiring for him?"</P>
<P>"What! he expected &s;omebody to inquire for him" &s;ays the man&mdash;"No," &s;ays I, "he did not, but if he did, what does that prove?&mdash;that argues nothing." With that he looked at the black&s;mith, and they went out of the &s;hop together, leav|ing my hor&s;e's &s;hoe undone. But I never minded that for the moment they were gone I mounted, and rode away as fa&s;t as I could. But in my fright, your Honour, I forgot to take the round about way, and &s;o came &s;traight home."</P>
<P>La Motte, extremely &s;hocked at Peter's intelligence, made no other reply than by cur&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> folly, and immediately went in &s;earch of Madame, who was walking with Adeline o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the banks of the river. La Motte was too much agitated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n his information by preface. "We are di&s;covered&punc;"
<PB N="49" REF="029379_0025_0FE089F24C332370">
&s;aid he, "the King's officers have been inquiring for me at Auboine, and Peter has plundered upon my ruin." He then informed her of what Peter had related, and bade her prepare to quit the abbey.</P>
<P>"But whither can we fly?" &s;aid Madame La Motte, &s;carcely able to &s;upport her&s;elf. "Any where!" &s;aid he, "to &s;tay here is certain de&s;truction. We mu&s;t take refuge in Switzerland, I think. If any part of France would have con|cealed me, &s;urely it had been this!"</P>
<P>"Alas, how are we per&s;ecuted!" rejoined Madame. "This &s;pot is &s;carcely made comfortable, before we are ob|liged to leave it, and go we know not whither."</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h we may not yet know whither," replied La Motte, "that is the lea&s;t evil that threatens us. Let us e&s;cape a pri&s;on, and I care not whither we go. But return to the abbey immediately, and pack up what moveables you can." A flood of tears came to the relief of Madame La Motte, and &s;he hung upon Adeline's arm &s;ilent and trembling. Adeline, though &s;he had no comfort to be&s;tow, endeavoured to com|mand her feelings and appear compo&s;ed. "Come," &s;aid La Motte, "we wa&s;te time; let us lament hereafter, but at pre|&s;ent prepare for flight. Exert a little of that fortitude, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for our pre&s;ervation. Adeline does not weep, yet her &s;tate is as wretched as your own, for I know not how long I &s;hall be able to protect her."</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding her terror, this reproof touched the pride of Madame La Motte, who dried her tears, but di&s;dained to reply, and looked at Adeline with a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;|plea&s;ure. As they moved &s;ilently toward the abbey, Adeline a&s;ked La Motte if he was &s;ure they were the king's officers, who inquired for him. "I cannot doubt it," he replied, "who el&s;e could po&s;&s;ibly inquire for me? Be&s;ides the beha|viour of the man, who mentioned my name, puts the matter beyond a que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"Perhaps not, &s;aid Madame La Motte: let us wait till morn|ing ere we &s;et off. We may then find it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to go."</P>
<P>"We may, indeed; the king's officers would probably by that time have told us as much." &mdash;La Motte went to give or|ders to Peter. "Set off in an hour," &s;aid Peter. "Lord ble&s;s you, ma&s;ter! only con&s;ider the coach wheel; it would take me a day at lea&s;t to mend it, for your Honour knows I never mended one in my life."</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="029379_0026_0FE089FCDE3F6C68">This was a circum&s;tance which La Motte had entirely over|looked. When they &s;ettled at the abbey, Peter had at fir&s;t been too bu&s;y in repairing the apartments, to remember the carriage, and afterwards believing it would not quickly be wanted, he had neglected to do it. La Motte's temper now entirely for&s;ook him, and with many execrations ordered Pe|ter to go to work immediately: but on &s;earching for the ma|terials formerly bought, they were no where to be found, and Peter at length remembered, though he was prudent enough to conceal this circum&s;tance, that he had u&s;ed the nails in re|pairing the abbey.</P>
<P>It was now, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible to quit the fore&s;t that night, and La Motte had only to con&s;ider the mo&s;t probable plan of concealment, &s;hould the officers of ju&s;tice vi&s;it the ruin before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e morning; a circum&s;tance, which the thoughtle&s;s|ne&s;s of Peter in returning from Auboine by the &s;traight way made not unlikely.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, indeed, it occurred to him, that though his family could not be removed, he might him&s;elf take one of the hor&s;es and e&s;cape from the fore&s;t before night. But he thought there would &s;till be &s;ome danger of detection in the towns through which he mu&s;t pa&s;s, and he could not well bear the idea of leaving his family unprotected, without knowing when he could return to them, or whither he could direct them to fol|low him. La Motte was not a man of very vigorous re&s;olu|tion, and he was, perhaps, rather more willing to &s;uffer i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> company than alone.</P>
<P>After much con&s;ideration, he recollected the trap-door of the clo&s;et belonging to the chambers above. It was invi&s;ible to the eye, and whatever might be its direction, it would &s;ecurely &s;helter <HI>him,</HI> at lea&s;t from di&s;covery. Having deliberated far|ther upon the &s;ubject, he determined to explore the rece&s;s t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which the &s;tairs led, and thought it po&s;&s;ible, that for a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> time his whole family might be concealed within it. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was little time between the &s;ugge&s;tion of the plan and the execution of his purpo&s;e, for darkne&s;s was &s;preading around and in every murmur of the wind he thought he heard the voices of his enemies.</P>
<P>He called for a light and a&s;cended alone to the chamber&punc; When he came to the clo&s;et, it was &s;ome time before he could find the trap-door, &s;o exactly did it corre&s;pond with the boards of the floor. At length, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound and rai&s;ed it. The
<PB N="51" REF="029379_0026_0FE089FCDE3F6C68">
chill damps of long confined air ru&s;hed from the aperture, and he &s;tood for a moment to let them pa&s;s, ere he de&s;cended. As he &s;tood looking down the aby&s;s, he recollected the report, which Peter had brought concerning the abbey, and it gave him an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation: But this &s;oon yielded to more pre&s;s|ing intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;tairs were &s;teep, and in many places trembled beneath his weight. Having continued to de&s;cend for &s;ome time, his feet touched the ground, and he found him&s;elf in a narrow pa&s;&s;age; but as he turned to pur&s;ue it&punc; the damp vapours curled round him and extingui&s;hed the light. He called aloud for Peter, but could make no body hear, and after &s;ome time, he endeavoured to find his way up the &s;tairs. In this, with difficulty, he &s;ucceeded, and pa&s;&s;ing the chambers with cautious &s;teps, de&s;cended the tower.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity which the place he had ju&s;t quitted &s;eemed to promi&s;e, was of too much importance to be &s;lightly rejected, and he determined immediately to make another experiment with the light:&mdash;having now fixed it in a lanthorn, he de|&s;cended a &s;econd time to the pa&s;&s;age. The current of vapours occa&s;ioned by the opening of the trap door, was abated, and the fre&s;h air thence admitted had begun to circulate: La Motte pa&s;&s;ed on unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age was of con&s;iderable length, and led him to a door, which was fa&s;tened. He placed the lanthorn at &s;ome di&s;tance to avoid the current of air, and applied his &s;trength to the door. It &s;hook under his hands but did not yield. Up|on examinig it more clo&s;ely, he perceived the wood round the lock was decayed, probably by the damps, and this encourag|ed him to proceed. After &s;ome time it gave way to his ef|fort, and he found him&s;elf in a &s;quare &s;tone room.</P>
<P>He &s;tood for &s;ome time to &s;urvey it. The walls, which were dripping with unwhole&s;ome dews, were entirely bare and afforded not even a window. A &s;mall iron grate alone admitted the air. At the further end, near a low rece&s;s, was another door. La Motte went towards it, and as he pa&s;&s;ed, looked into the rece&s;s. Upon the ground within it, &s;tood a large che&s;t, which he went forward to examine, and lifting the lid, he &s;aw the remains of a human &s;keleton. Horror &s;truck upon his heart, and he involuntarily &s;tepped back. During a pau&s;e of &s;ome moments, his fir&s;t emotions &s;ub&s;ided. That thrilling curio&s;ity, which objects of terror often excite
<PB N="52" REF="029379_0027_0FE08A028235AC80">
in the human mind, impelled him to take a &s;econd view of this di&s;mal &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>La Motte &s;tood motionle&s;s as he gazed; the object be|fore him &s;eemed to confirm the report that &s;ome per&s;on had formerly been murdered in the abbey. At length he clo&s;ed the che&s;t and advanced to the &s;econd door, which al&s;o was fa&s;t|ened, but the key was in the lock. He turned it with dif|ficulty, and then found the door was held by two &s;trong bolts. Having undrawn the&s;e, it di&s;clo&s;ed a flight of &s;teps, which he de&s;cended. They terminated in a chain of low vaults, or ra|ther cells, that, from the manner of their con&s;truction and pre&s;ent condition, &s;eemed to have been coeval with the mo&s;t ancient parts of the abbey. La Motte, in his then depre&s;&s;ed &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of mind, thought them the burial places of the monks, who formerly inhabited the pile above, but they were more calcu|lated for places of penance for the living than of re&s;t for the dead.</P>
<P>Having reached the extremity of the&s;e cells, the way was again clo&s;ed by a door. La Motte now he&s;itated whether he &s;hould attempt to proceed any farther. The pre&s;ent &s;pot &s;eemed to afford the &s;ecurity he &s;ought. Here he might pa&s;s the night unmole&s;ted by apprehen&s;ion of di&s;covery, and it was mo&s;t probable, that if the officers arrived in the night, and found the abbey vaca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, they would quit it before morning, or at lea&s;t before he could have any occa&s;ion to emerge from concealment. The&s;e con&s;iderations re&s;tored his mind to a &s;tate of greater compo&s;ure. His only immediate care was to bring his family as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to this place of &s;ecurity le&s;t the officers &s;hould come unawares upon them; and while he &s;tood thus mu&s;ing, he blamed him&s;elf for delay.</P>
<P>But an irre&s;i&s;table de&s;ire of knowing to what this door led, arre&s;ted his &s;teps, and he turned to open it. The door howe|ver was fa&s;tened, and as he attempted to force it, he &s;udden|ly thought he heard a noi&s;e above. It now occurred to him, that the officers might already have arrived, and he quitted the cells with precipitation, intending to li&s;ten at the trap-door.</P>
<P>"There, &s;aid he, I may wait in &s;ecurity, and perhaps hear &s;omething of what pa&s;&s;es. My family will not be known, or at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t, not hurt, and their unea&s;ine&s;s on my account, they mu&s;t learn to endure."</P>
<P>The&s;e were the arguments of La Motte, in which it mu&s;t be owned, &s;elfi&s;h prudence was more con&s;picuous than tender anxiety for his wife. He had by this time reached the bot|tom
<PB N="53" REF="029379_0027_0FE08A028235AC80">
of the &s;tairs, when on looking up he perceived the trap-door was left open, and a&s;cending in ha&s;te to clo&s;e it, he heard foot&s;teps advancing through the chamber above. Before he could a&s;cend entirely out of &s;ight, he again looked up and perceived through the aperture the face of a man looking down upon him. "Ma&s;ter," cried Peter;&mdash;La Motte was &s;omewhat relieved at the &s;ound of his voice, though angry that he had occa&s;ioned him &s;o much terror.</P>
<P>"What brings you here and what is the matter below?"</P>
<P>"Nothing, Sir, nothing's the matter, only my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ent me to &s;ee after your Honour."</P>
<P>"There's nobody there then," &s;aid La Motte," &s;etting his foot upon the &s;tep."</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir, there is my mi&s;tre&s;s and Mademoi&s;elle Ade|line and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well&mdash;well" &s;aid La Motte bri&s;kly&mdash;"go your ways, I am coming."</P>
<P>"He informed Madame La Motte where he had been, and of his intention of &s;ecreting him&s;elf, and deliberated upon the means of convincing the officers, &s;hould they arrive, time he had quitted the abbey. For this purpo&s;e, he ordered all the moveable furniture to be conveyed to the cells below. La Motte him&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and every hand was em|ployed for di&s;patch. In a very &s;hort time, the habitable part of the fabric was left almo&s;t as de&s;olate as he had found it. He then bade Peter take the hor&s;es to a di&s;tance from the abbey, and turn them loo&s;e. After farther con&s;ider|ation, he thought it might contribute to mi&s;lead them, if he placed in &s;ome con&s;picuous part of the fabric an in&s;cription, &s;ignifying his condition, and mentioning the date of his de|parture from the abbey. Over the door of the tower which led to the habitable part of the &s;tructure, he therefore, cut the following lines.</P>
<Q><L>"O ye! whom misfortune may lead to this &s;pot,</L>

<P>After engraving the&s;e words with a knife, the &s;mall &s;tock of provi&s;ions remaining from the week's &s;upply (for Peter, in his fright, had returned unloaded from his la&s;t journey) was put

<P>La Motte now took the light and led the way; Madame followed, and then Adeline.

<P>"There is no harm in loving good wine, as your Honour knows."</P>
<P>"Have done with this buffoonery," &s;aid La Motte, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one more authoritative, "and go fir&s;t." Peter obeyed.</P>
<P>They came to the vaulted room. The di&s;mal &s;pectacle he had &s;een there, deterred La Motte from pa&s;&s;ing the night in this chamber; and the furniture had, by his own order, been conveyed to the cells below. He was anxious that his family &s;hould not perceive the &s;keleton; an object which would probably excite a degree of horror not to be overcome during their &s;tay. La Motte now pa&s;&s;ed the che&s;t in ha&s;te; and Ma|dame La Motte and Adeline were too much engro&s;&s;ed by their own thoughts, to give minute attention to external circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>When they reached the cells, Madame La Motte wept at the nece&s;&s;ity which condemned her to a &s;pot &s;o di&s;mal, "Alas," &s;aid &s;he, "are we indeed, thus reduced! The apartments above, formerly appeared to me a deplorable habitation; but they are a palace compared to the&s;e."</P>
<P>"True, my dear," &s;aid La Motte, "and let the remem|brance of what you once thought them, &s;oothe your di&s;con|tent now; the&s;e cells are al&s;o a palace, compared to the Bic&eacute;tre, or the Ba&s;tile, and to the terrors of farther puni&s;hment, which would accompany them: let the apprehen&s;ion of the greater evil teach you to endure the le&s;s: I am contented if we find here the refuge I &s;eek."</P>
<P>Madame La Motte was &s;ilent, and Adeline, forgetting her late unkindne&s;s, endeavoured as much as &s;he could to con&s;ole her; while her heart was &s;inking with the misfortunes, which
<PB N="55" REF="029379_0028_0FE08A0F74537260">
&s;he could not but anticipate, &s;he appeared compo&s;ed and even cheerful. She attended Madame La Motte with the mo&s;t watchful &s;olicitude, and felt &s;o thankful that La Motte was now &s;ecreted within this rece&s;s, that &s;he almo&s;t lo&s;t her per|ception of its glooms and inconveniences.</P>
<P>This &s;he artle&s;sly expre&s;&s;ed to him, who could not be in&s;en|&s;ible to the tenderne&s;s it di&s;covered. Madame La Motte was al&s;o &s;en&s;ible of it, and it renewed a painful &s;en&s;ation. The effu&s;ions of gratitude &s;he mi&s;took for tho&s;e of tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>La Motte returned frequently to the trap-door, to li&s;ten if any body was in the abbey; but no &s;ound di&s;turbed the &s;till|ne&s;s of night; at length they &s;at down to &s;upper; the repa&s;t was a melancholy one "If the officers do not come hither to night," &s;aid Madame La Motte, &s;ighing, "&s;uppo&s;e, my dear, Peter returns to Auboine to morrow. He may there learn &s;omething more of this affair; or at lea&s;t, he might procure a carriage to convey us hence."</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure he might, &s;aid La Motte peevi&s;hly, and people to attend it al&s;o. Peter would be an excellent per&s;on to &s;hew the officers the way to the abbey, and to inform them of what they might el&s;e be in doubt about my concealment here."</P>
<P>"How cruel is this irony!" replyed Madame La Motte, "I propo&s;ed only what I thought would be for our mutual good; my judgment was, perhaps, wrong, but my intention was certainly right." Tears &s;welled into her eyes as &s;he &s;poke the&s;e words. Adeline wi&s;hed to relieve her; but delicacy kept her &s;ilent. La Motte ob&s;erved the effect of his &s;peech and &s;omething like remor&s;e touched his heart. He approached, and taking her hand, "You mu&s;t allow for the perturbation, of my mind," &s;aid he, "I did not mean to afflict you thus. The idea of &s;ending Peter to Auboine, where he has already done &s;o much harm by his blunders, tea&s;ed me, and I could not let it pa&s;s unnoticed. No, my dear, our only chance of &s;afety is to remain where we are while our provi&s;ions la&s;t. If the officers do not come here to night, they probably will to morrow, or perhaps, the next day. When they have &s;earched the abbey, without finding me, they will depart; we may then emerge from this rece&s;s, and take mea&s;ures for removing to a di&s;tant country."</P>
<P>Madame La Motte acknowledged the ju&s;tice of his words, and her mind being relieved by the little apology he had made, &s;he became tolerably cheerful. Supper being ended,
<PB N="56" REF="029379_0029_0FE08A15CF17B560">
La Motte &s;tationed the faithful, though &s;imple Peter, at the foot of the &s;teps that a&s;cended to the clo&s;et; there to keep watch during the night. Having done this, he returned to the lower cells, where he had left his little family. The beds were &s;pread, and having mournfully bid each other good night, they laid down and implored re&s;t.</P>
<P>Adeline's thoughts were too bu&s;y to &s;uffer her to repo&s;e, and when &s;he believed her companions were &s;unk in &s;lumbers, &s;he indulged the &s;orrow which reflection brought. She al&s;o looked forward to the future with the mo&s;t mournful apprehen&s;ion. "Should La Motte be &s;eized, what was to become of her? She would then be a wanderer in the wide world; without friends to protect, or money to &s;upport her; the pro&s;pect was gloomy&mdash;was terrible!" She &s;urveyed it and &s;huddered! The di&s;tre&s;&s;es too of Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte, whom &s;he lov|ed with the mo&s;t lively affection, formed no incon&s;iderable part of her's.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;he looked back to her father; but in him &s;he only &s;aw an enemy, from whom &s;he mu&s;t fly; this remem|brance heightened her &s;orrow; yet it was not the recollection of the &s;uffering he had occa&s;ioned her, by which &s;he was &s;o much afflicted, as by the &s;en&s;e of his unkindne&s;s: &s;he wept bitterly. At length, with that artle&s;s piety, which innocence only knows, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed the Supreme Being, and re&s;igned her&s;elf to his care. Her mind then gradually became peaceful and re-a&s;&s;ured, and &s;oon after &s;he &s;unk to repo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. A Surpri&s;e&mdash;An Adventure&mdash;A My&s;tery.</HEAD>
<P>THE night pa&s;&s;ed without any alarm; Peter had remained upon his po&s;t, and heard nothing that prevented his &s;leeping. La Motte heard him, long before he &s;aw him, mo&s;t mu&s;ically &s;noring; though it mu&s;t be owned, there was more of the ba&s;s than of any other part of the gamut in his performance. He was &s;oon rou&s;ed by the <HI>bravura</HI> of La Motte, who&s;e notes &s;ounded di&s;cord to his ears, and de&s;troyed &s;he torpor of his tranquillity.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="029379_0029_0FE08A15CF17B560">"God ble&s;s you, Ma&s;ter, what's the matter?" cried Peter, waking, "are they come?"</P>
<P>"Yes, for aught you care, they might be come. Did I place you here to &s;leep, &s;irrah?"</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s you, Ma&s;ter," returned Peter, "&s;leep is the only com|fort to be had here; I'm &s;ure I would not deny it to a dog in &s;uch a place as this."</P>
<P>La Motte &s;ternly que&s;tioned him concerning any noi&s;e he might have heard in the night; and Peter full as &s;olemnly pro|te&s;ted he had heard none; an a&s;&s;ertion which was &s;trictly true, for he had enjoyed the comfort of being a&s;leep the whole time.</P>
<P>La Motte a&s;cended to the trap-door and li&s;tened attentively. No &s;ounds were heard, and as he ventured to lift it, the full light of the &s;un bur&s;t upon his &s;ight, the morning being now far advanced; he walked &s;oftly along the chambers, and look|ed through a window; no per&s;on was to be &s;een. Encourag|ed by this apparent &s;ecurity, he ventured down the &s;tairs of the tower, and entered the fir&s;t apartment. He was proceed|ing towards the &s;econd, when, &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, he fir&s;t peeped through the crevice of the door, which &s;tood half open. He looked, and di&s;tinctly &s;aw a per&s;on &s;itting near the window, upon which his arm re&s;ted.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery &s;o much &s;hocked him, that for a moment he lo&s;t all pre&s;ence of mind, and was utterly unable to move from the &s;pot. The per&s;on, who&s;e back was towards him, aro&s;e, and turned his head. La Motte now recovered him&s;elf, and quitting the apartment as quickly, and at the &s;ame time, as &s;ilently as po&s;&s;ible, a&s;cended to the clo&s;et. He rai&s;ed the trap-door, but before he clo&s;ed it, heard the foot&s;teps of a per&s;on entering the outer chamber. Bolts, or other fa&s;tening to the trap there was none; and his &s;ecurity depended &s;olely upon the exact corre&s;pondence of the boards. The outer door of the &s;tone room had no means of defence; and the fa&s;tenings of the inner one were on the wrong &s;ide to afford &s;ecurity, even till &s;ome means of e&s;cape could be found.</P>
<P>When he reached this room, he pau&s;ed, and heard di&s;tinctly, per&s;ons walking in the clo&s;et above. While he was li&s;tening he heard a voice call him by name, and he in&s;tantly fled to the cells below, expecting every moment to hear the trap lifted, and the foot&s;teps of pur&s;uit; but he was fled beyond the reach of hearing either. Having thrown him&s;elf on the ground, at the farthe&s;t extremity of the vaults, he lay for
<PB N="58" REF="029379_0030_0FE08A2407E57FE8">
&s;ome time breathle&s;s with agitation. Madame La Motte and Adeline, in the utmo&s;t terror, inquired what had hap|pened. It was &s;ome time before he could &s;peak; when he did, it was almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary, for the di&s;tant noi&s;es which founded from above informed his family of a part of the truth.</P>
<P>The &s;ounds did not &s;eem to approach, but Madame La Motte, unable to command her terror, &s;hrieked aloud: this redoubled the di&s;tre&s;s of La Motte. "You have already de|&s;troyed me," cried he; "that &s;hriek has informed them where I am." He traver&s;ed the cells with cla&s;ped hands and quick &s;teps. Adeline &s;tood pale and &s;till as death, &s;up|porting Madame La Motte, whom, with difficulty, &s;he pre|vented from fainting. "O! Dupras! Dupras! you are al|ready avenged&punc;" &s;aid he, in a voice that &s;eemed to bur&s;t from his heart: there was a pau&s;e of &s;ilence. "But why &s;hould I deceive my&s;elf with a hope of e&s;caping?" he re|&s;umed, "why do I wait here for their coming? Let me rather end the&s;e torturing pangs by throwing my&s;elf into their hands at once."</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he moved towards the door, but the di&s;tre&s;s of Madame La Motte arre&s;ted his &s;teps. "Stay," &s;aid &s;he, "for my &s;ake, &s;tay; do not leave me thus, nor throw your|&s;elf voluntarily into de&s;truction!"</P>
<P>"Surely, Sir," &s;aid Adeline, "you are too precipitate&punc; this de&s;pair is u&s;ele&s;s, as it is ill-founded. We hear no per&s;on approaching; if the officers had di&s;covered the trap-door, they would certainly have been here before now." The words of Adeline &s;tilled the tumult of his mind: the agita|tion of terror &s;ub&s;ided; and rea&s;on beamed a feeble ray upon his hopes. He li&s;tened attentively, and perceiving that all was &s;ilent, advanced with caution to the &s;tone-room; and thence to the foot of the &s;tairs that led to the trap-door. It was clo&s;ed&punc; no &s;ound was heard above.</P>
<P>He watched a long time, and the &s;ilence continuing, his hopes &s;trengthened, and at length he began to believe that the officers had quitted the abbey; the day however was &s;pent in anxious watchfulne&s;s. He did not dare to unclo&s;e the trap-door; and he frequently thought he heard di&s;tant noi&s;es. It was evident, however, that the &s;ecret of the clo&s;et had e&s;caped di&s;covery; and on this circum&s;tance he ju&s;tly founded his &s;ecurity The following night was pa&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> like the day, in trembling hope, and ince&s;&s;ant watching.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="029379_0030_0FE08A2407E57FE8">But the nece&s;&s;ities of hunger now threatened them. The provi&s;ions which had been di&s;tributed with the nice&s;t economy, were nearly exhau&s;ted, and the mo&s;t deplorable con&s;equences might be expected from their remaining longer in conceal|ment. Thus circum&s;tanced, La Motte deliberated upon the mo&s;t prudent method of proceeding. There appeared no other alternative, than to &s;end Peter to Auboine, the only town from which he could return within the time pre&s;cribed by their nece&s;&s;ities. There was game, indeed in the fore&s;t; but Peter could neither handle a gun, or u&s;e a fi&s;hing rod to any advantage.</P>
<P>It was, therefore, agreed he &s;hould go to Auboine for a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, and at the &s;ame time bring materials for mending the coach-wheel, that they might have &s;ome ready conveyance from the fore&s;t. La Motte forbade Peter to a&s;k any que&s;tions concerning the people who had inquired for him, or take any methods for di&s;covering whether they had quitted the country, le&s;t his blunders &s;hould again betray him. He ordered him to be entirely &s;ilent as to the&s;e &s;ubjects, and leave the place with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>A difficulty yet remained to be overcome&mdash;Who &s;hould fir&s;t venture abroad into the abbey, to learn, whether it was vacated by the officers of ju&s;tice? La Motte con&s;idered that if he was again &s;een, he &s;hould be effectually betrayed; which would not be <HI>&s;o</HI> certain, if one of his family was ob&s;erved, for they were all unknown to the officers. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that the per&s;on he &s;ent &s;hould have courage enough to go through with the inquiry, and wit enough to conduct it with caution. Peter, perhaps, had the fir&s;t; but was certainly de&s;titute of the la&s;t. Annette had neither. La Motte looked at his wife, and a&s;ked her, if, for his &s;ake, &s;he dared to ven|ture. Her heart &s;hrunk from the propo&s;al, yet &s;he was un|willing to refu&s;e, or appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> indifferent upon a point &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial to the &s;afety of her hu&s;band. Adeline ob&s;erved in her countenance the agitation of her mind, and &s;urmounting the fears, which had hitherto kept her &s;ilent, &s;he offered her&s;elf to go.</P>
<P>"They will be le&s;s likely to offend me," &s;aid &s;he, "than a man." Shame would not &s;uffer La Motte to accept her offer; and Madame, touched by the magnanimity of her con|duct, felt a momentary renewal of all her former kindne&s;s. Adeline pre&s;&s;ed her propo&s;al &s;o warmly, and &s;eemed &s;o much
<PB N="60" REF="029379_0031_0FE08BA432A3DA18">
in earne&s;t, that La Motte began to he&s;itate. "You, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "once pre&s;erved me from the mo&s;t imminent danger, and your kindne&s;s has &s;ince protected me. Do not refu&s;e me the &s;atisfaction of de&s;erving your goodne&s;s by a grateful re|turn of it. Let me go into the abbey, and if, by &s;o doing, I &s;hould pre&s;erve you from evil, I &s;hall be &s;ufficiently rewarded for what little danger I may incur, for my plea&s;ure will be at lea&s;t equal to yours."</P>
<P>Madame La Motte could &s;carcely refrain from tears as Adeline &s;poke; and La Motte, &s;ighing deeply, &s;aid, "Well, be it &s;o; go, Adeline, and from this moment con&s;ider me as your debtor." Adeline &s;tayed not to reply, but taking a light, quitted the cells, La Motte following to rai&s;e the trap-door, and cautioning her to look, if po&s;&s;ible, into every apart|ment, before &s;he entered it. "If you <HI>&s;hould</HI> be &s;een," &s;aid he, "you mu&s;t account for your appearance &s;o as not to di&s;|cover me. Your own pre&s;ence of mind may a&s;&s;i&s;t you, I can|not.&mdash;God ble&s;s you."</P>
<P>When &s;he was gone, Madame La Motte's admiraion of her conduct began to yield to other emotions. Di&s;tru&s;t gradually undermined kindne&s;s, and jealou&s;y rai&s;ed &s;u&s;picions. "It mu&s;t be a &s;entiment more powerful than gratitude," thought &s;he, "that could teach Adeline to &s;ubdue her fears. What, but Love, could influence her to a conduct &s;o generous!" Madame La Motte, when &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to account for Adeline's conduct, without alledging &s;ome intere&s;ted mo|tives for it, however her &s;u&s;picions might agree with the prac|tice of the world, had &s;urely forgotten how much &s;he once ad|mired the purity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of her young friend.</P>
<P>Adeline, mean while, a&s;cended the chambers: the cheerful beams of the &s;un played once more upon her &s;ight, and re|animated her &s;pirits; &s;he walked lightly through the apart|ments, nor &s;topped till &s;he came to the &s;tairs of the tower. Here &s;he &s;tood for &s;ome time, but no &s;ounds met her ear, &s;ave the &s;ighing of the wind among the trees, and, at length, &s;he de|&s;cended. She pa&s;&s;ed the apartments below, without &s;eeing any per&s;on; and the little furniture that remained, &s;eemed to &s;tand exactly as &s;he had left it. She now ventured to look out from the tower: the only animate objects, that appeared, were the deer, quietly grazing under the &s;hade of the woods. Her favourite little fawn di&s;tingui&s;hed Adeline, and came bounding towards her with &s;trong marks of joy. She was &s;ome|what
<PB N="61" REF="029379_0031_0FE08BA432A3DA18">
what alarmed le&s;t the animal, being ob&s;erved, &s;hould betray her, and walked &s;wiftly away through the cloi&s;ters.</P>
<P>She opened the door that led to the great hall of the abbey, but the pa&s;&s;age was &s;o gloomy and dark that &s;he feared to enter it, and &s;tarted back. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, that &s;he &s;hould examine farther particularly on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the ruin, of which &s;he had hitherto had no view: but her fears returned when &s;he recollected how far it would lead her from her only place of refuge, and how difficult it would be to retreat. She he&s;itated what to do: but when &s;he recol|lected her obligations to La Motte, and con&s;idered this as per|haps her only opportunity of doing him a &s;ervice, &s;he deter|mined to proceed.</P>
<P>As the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed rapidly over her mind, &s;he rai&s;ed her innocent looks to heaven, and breathed a &s;ilent prayer. With trembling &s;teps the proceeded over fragments of the ru|in, looking anxiou&s;ly around, and often &s;tarting as the breeze ru&s;tled among the trees, mi&s;taking it for the whi&s;perings of men. She came to the lawn which fronted the fabric, but no per&s;on was to be &s;een, and her &s;pirits revived. The great door of the hall &s;he now endeavoured to open, but &s;uddenly remembering that it was fa&s;tened by La Mote's orders, &s;he proceeded to the north end of the abbey, and having &s;urvey|ed the pro&s;pect around as far as the thick foliage of the trees would permit, without perceiving any per&s;on, &s;he turned her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the tower from which &s;he had i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>Adeline was now light of heart, and returned with impa|tience to inform La Motte of his &s;ecurity. In the cloi&s;ters &s;he was again met by her little favourite, and &s;topped for a moment to care&s;s it. The fawn &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible to the &s;ound of her voice, and di&s;covered new joy; but while &s;he &s;poke, it &s;uddenly &s;tarted from her hand, and looking up &s;he perceived the door of the pa&s;&s;age, leading to the great hall open, and a man in the habit of a &s;oldier i&s;&s;ue forth.</P>
<P>With the &s;wiftne&s;s of an arrow &s;he fled along the cloi&s;ters, nor once ventured to look back; but a voice called to her to &s;top, and &s;he heard &s;teps advancing quick in pur&s;uit. Before &s;he could reach the tower, her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reath failed her, and &s;he lean|ed again&s;t a piller of the ruin, pale and exhau&s;ted. The man came up, and gazing at her with a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ur|pri&s;e and curio&s;ity, he a&s;&s;umed a gentle manner, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he had nothing to fear, and inquired if &s;he belonged to La
<PB N="62" REF="029379_0032_0FE08A28B84FAA28">
Motte: ob&s;erving that &s;he &s;till looked terrified and remained &s;ilent, he repeated his a&s;&s;urances and his que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"I know that he is concealed within the ruin," &s;aid the &s;tranger; "the occa&s;ion of his concealment I al&s;o know; but it is of the utmo&s;t importance I &s;hould &s;ee him, and he will then be convinced he has nothing to fear from me." Adeline trem|bled &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that it was with difficulty &s;he could &s;up|port her&s;elf&mdash;&s;he he&s;itated, and knew not what to reply. Her manner &s;eemed to confirm the &s;u&s;picions of the &s;tranger, and her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this, increa&s;ed her embara&s;&s;ment: he took advantage of it to pre&s;s her farther. Adeline, at length replied that "La Motte had &s;ome time &s;ince re&s;ided at the abbey." "And does &s;till Madam," &s;aid the &s;tranger; "lead me to where he may be found&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;ee him, and"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Never, Sir," replied Adeline, "and I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you it will be in vain to &s;earch for him."</P>
<P>"That I mu&s;t try," re&s;umed he, "&s;ince you, Madam, will not a&s;&s;i&s;t me. I have already followed him to &s;ome chambers above, where I &s;uddenly lo&s;t him: thereabouts he mu&s;t be concealed, and it's plain therefore, they afford &s;ome &s;ecret pa&s;&s;age."</P>
<P>Without waiting Adeline's reply, he &s;prung to the door of the tower. She now thought it would betray a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the truth of his conjecture to follow him, and re&s;olved to remain below. But upon farther con&s;ideration, it occurred to her, that he might &s;teal &s;ilently into the clo&s;et, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ur|pri&s;e La Motte at the door of the trap. She, therefore, ha&s;|tened after him, that her voice might prevent the dan|ger &s;he apprehended. He was already in the &s;econd cham|ber, when &s;he overtook him, &s;he immediately began to &s;peak aloud.</P>
<P>This room he &s;earched with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous care, but finding no private door, or other outlet, he proceeded to the clo&s;et; then it was that it required all her fortitude to conceal her agitation. He continued the &s;earch. "Within the&s;e chambers, I know he is concealed," &s;aid he, "though hither|to I have not been able to di&s;cover how. It was hither I followed a man, whom I believe to be him, and he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> e&s;cape without a pa&s;&s;age; I &s;hall not quit the place till I have found it."</P>
<P>He examined the walls and the boards, but without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|vering the divi&s;ion of the floor, which indeed, &s;o exactly co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+re&s;ponded,

that La Motte him&s;elf had not perceived by the eye, but by the trembling of the floor beneath his feet. Here is &s;ome my&s;tery," &s;aid the &s;tranger, which I can|not comprehend and perhaps never &s;hall." He was turn|ing to quit the clo&s;et when, who can paint the di&s;tre&s;s of Ade|line, upon &s;eeing the trap-door gently rai&s;ed, and La Motte him&s;elf appeared. "Hah!" cried the &s;tranger, advancing ea|garly to him. La Motte &s;prang forward, and they were locked in each other's arms.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hment of Adeline for a moment, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed even her former di&s;tre&s;s; but a remembrance darted acro&s;s her mind, which explained the pre&s;ent &s;cene, and before La Mot|te could exclaim "My &s;on!" &s;he new the &s;tranger as &s;uch. Peter who &s;tood at the foot of the &s;tairs and heard what pa&s;&s;ed above, flew to acquaint his mi&s;tre&s;s with the joyful di&s;covery, and, in a few moments &s;he was folded in the embrace of her &s;on. This &s;pot &s;o lately the man&s;ion of de&s;pair, &s;eemed meta|morpho&s;ed into the palace of plea&s;ure, and the walls echoed only to the accents of joy and congratulation.</P>
<P>The joy of Peter on this occa&s;ion was beyond expre&s;&s;ion: he acted a perfect pantomime&mdash;he capered about, cla&s;ped his hands&mdash;ran to his young ma&s;ter&mdash;&s;hook him by the hand, in &s;pite of the frowns of La Motte! ran every where without knowing for what, and gave no rational an&s;wer to any thing that was &s;aid to him.</P>
<P>After their fir&s;t emotions were &s;ub&s;ided, La Motte, as if &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf re&s;umed his wonted &s;olemnity: "I am to blame," &s;aid he, "thus to give way to joy, when I am &s;till, perhaps &s;urrounded by danger. Let us &s;ecure a retreat while it is yet in our power," continued he, "in a few hours the King's officers may &s;earch for me again."</P>
<P>Louis comprehended his father's words, and immediately relieved his apprehen&s;ions by the following relation:</P>
<P>"A letter from Mon&s;ieur Nemours, containing an account of your flight from Paris, reached me at Peronne, where I was then upon duty with my regiment. He mentioned that you was gone towards the &s;outh of France, but as he had not &s;ince heard from you, he was ignorant of the place of your refuge. It was about this time that I was di&s;patched into Flanders; and, being unable to obtain farther intelligence of you, I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome weeks of very painful &s;olicitude. At the con|clu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the campaign, I obtained leave of ab&s;ence, and im|mediately
<PB N="64" REF="029379_0033_0FE08A3657DA2BB0">
&s;et out for Paris, hoping to learn from Nemours, where you had found an a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>"Of this, however, he was equally&punc; ignorant with my&s;elf. He informed me that you had once before written to him from D&mdash;, upon your &s;econd day's journey from Paris, under an a&s;&s;umed name, as had been agreed upon; and that you then &s;aid the fear of di&s;covery would prevent your haz|arding another letter. He, therefore, remained ignorant of your abode, but &s;aid he had no doubt you had continued your journey to the &s;outhward. Upon this &s;lender information I quitted Paris in &s;earch of you, and proceeded immediately to V&mdash;, where my inquiries, concerning your farther pro|gre&s;s, were &s;ucce&s;sful as far as M&mdash;. There they told me you had &s;taid &s;ome time, on account of the illne&s;s of a young lady; a circum&s;tance which perplexed me much, as I could not imagine what young lady would accompany you. I proceeded, however, to L&mdash;; but thereall traces of you &s;eemed to be lo&s;t. As I &s;at mu&s;ing at the window of the inn, I ob&s;erved &s;ome &s;cribbling on the gla&s;s, and the curio&s;ity of idlene&s;s prompted me to read it. I thought I knew the cha|racters, and the lines I read confirmed my conjecture, for I re|membered to have heard you often repeat them.</P>
<P>"Here I renewed my inquiries concerning your route, and at length I made the people of the inn recollect you, and tra|ced you as far as Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oine. There I again lo&s;t you, till upon my return from a fruitle&s;s inquiry in the neighbourhood, the landlord of the little inn where I lodged, told me he be|lieved he had heard news of you, and immediately recounted what had happened at a black&s;mith's &s;hop a few hours before.</P>
<P>"His de&s;cription of Peter was &s;o exact, that I had not a doubt it was you, who inhabited the abbey; and, as I knew your nece&s;&s;ity for concealment, Peter's denial did not &s;hake my co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|fidence. The next morning with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lord, I found my way hither, and, having &s;earched every vi&s;|ible part of the fabrick, I began to credit Peter's a&s;&s;ertion: your appearance, however, de&s;troyed this fear, by proving that the place was &s;till inhabited, for you di&s;appeared &s;o in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly, that I was not certain it was you whom I had &s;een. I continued &s;eeking you till near the clo&s;e of day, and till the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;carcely quitted the chambers when you had di&s;appeared. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> called on you repeatedly, believing that my voice might con|vince you of your mi&s;take. At length I retired to pa&s;s the night at a cottage near the border of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="029379_0033_0FE08A3657DA2BB0">"I came early this morning to renew my inquiries, and hoped that, believing your&s;elf &s;afe, you would emerge from concealment. But how was I di&s;appointed to find the abbey &s;ilent and &s;olitary as I had left it the preceding evening! I was returning once more from the great hall, when the voice of this young lady caught my ear, and effected the di&s;covery I had &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought.</P>
<P>This little narrative entirely di&s;&s;ipated the late apprehen|&s;ions of La Motte, but he now dreaded that the inquiries of his &s;on, and his own obvious de&s;ire of concealment, might ex|cite a curio&s;ity among&s;t the people of Auboine, and lead to a di&s;covery of his true circum&s;tances. However, for the pre|&s;ent he determined to di&s;mi&s;s all painful thoughts, and, en|deavoured to enjoy the comfort which the pre&s;ence of his &s;on had brought him. The furniture was removed to a more hab|itable part of the abbey, and the cells were again abandoned to their own glooms.</P>
<P>The arrival of her &s;on &s;eemed to have animated Madame La Motte with new life, and all her afflictions were for the pre&s;ent, ab&s;orbed in joy. She often gazed &s;ilently on him with a mother's fondne&s;s, and her partiality heightened every improvement which time had wrought in his per&s;on and man|ner. He was now in his twenty-third year; his per&s;on was manly and his air military; his manners were unaffected and graceful, rather than dignified; and though his features were irregular, they compo&s;ed a countenance, which, having &s;een it once, you would &s;eek it again.</P>
<P>She made eager inquiries after the friends &s;he had left at Paris, and learned, that within the few months of her ab&s;ence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome had died and others had quitted the place. La Motte al&s;o learned, that a very &s;trenuous &s;earch for him had been pro|&s;ecuted at Paris; and though this intelligence was only what he had before expected, it &s;hocked him &s;o much, that he now declared it would be expedient to remove to a di&s;tant coun|try. Louis did not &s;cruple to &s;ay, that he thought he would be as &s;afe at the abbey as at any other place; and repeated what Nemours had &s;aid, that the King's officers had been un|able to trace any part of his route from Paris.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides," re&s;umed Louis, "this abbey is protected by a &s;upernatural power, and none of the country people dare ap|proach it."</P>
<P>"Plea&s;e you, my young ma&s;ter," &s;aid Peter, who was wait|ing in the room, "we were frightened enough the fir&s;t night we came here, and I, my&s;elf, God forgive me! thought the
<PB N="66" REF="029379_0034_0FE08A3C19C6E080">
place was inhabited by devils, but they were only owls, and &s;uch like, after all."</P>
<P>"Your opinion was not a&s;ked," &s;aid La Motte, "learn to be &s;ilent."</P>
<P>Peter was aba&s;hed. When he had quitted the room, La Motte a&s;ked his &s;on with &s;eeming carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, what were the reports circulated by the country people? "O! Sir," replied Louis, "I cannot recollect half of them. I remember, how|ever, they &s;aid, that many years ago&punc; a per&s;on (but no body had ever &s;een him, &s;o we may judge how far the report ought to be credited) a per&s;on was privately brought to this abbey, and confined in &s;ome part of it, and that there was &s;trong rea|&s;ons to believe he came unfairly to his end."</P>
<P>La Motte &s;ighed. "They farther &s;aid," continued Louis, "that the &s;pectre of the decea&s;ed had ever &s;ince watched night|ly among the ruins: and to make the &s;tory more wonderful, for the marvellous is the delight of the vulgar, they added, that there was a certain part of the ruin, from whence no per|&s;on that had dared to explore it, had ever returned. Thus people, who have few objects of real intere&s;t to engage their thoughts, conjure up for them&s;elves imaginary ones."</P>
<P>La Motte &s;at amu&s;ing. "And what were the rea&s;ons," &s;aid he, at length awaking from his reverie, "they pretended to a&s;&s;ign, for believing the per&s;on confined here was murdered?"</P>
<P>"They did not u&s;e a term &s;o po&s;itive as that," replied Louis.</P>
<P>"True," &s;aid La Motte, recollecting him&s;elf, "they only &s;aid he came unfairly to his end."</P>
<P>"That is a nice di&s;tinction," &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P>"Why I could not well comprehend what the&s;e rea&s;ons were," re&s;umed Louis, "the people indeed &s;ay, that the per|&s;on, who was brought here, was never known to depart, but I do not find it certain that he ever arrived; that there w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trange privacy and my&s;tery ob&s;erved while he was here, and that the abbey has never &s;ince been inhabited by its owner. There &s;eems, however, to be nothing in all this that de&s;erves to be remembered." La Motte rai&s;ed his head, as if to reply, when the entrance of Madame turned the di&s;cour&s;e upon a new &s;ubject, and it was not re&s;umed that day.</P>
<P>Peter was now di&s;patched for provi&s;ions, while La Mott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Louis retired to con&s;ider how far it was &s;afe for them to continue at the abbey. La Motte notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;ur|ances lately given him, could not but think that Peter's blun|ders and his &s;on's inquiries might lead to a di&s;covery of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="67" REF="029379_0034_0FE08A3C19C6E080">
re&s;idence. He revolved this in his mind for &s;ome time, but at length a thought &s;truck him, that the latter of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances might con&s;iderably contribute to his &s;ecurity. "If you," &s;aid he to Louis, "return to the inn at Auboine, from whence you were directed here, and without &s;eeming to in|tend giving intelligence, <HI>do</HI> give the landlord an account of your having found the abbey uninhabited, and then add, that you had di&s;covered the re&s;idence of the per&s;on you &s;ought in &s;ome di&s;tant town, it would &s;uppre&s;s any reports that may at pre&s;ent exi&s;t, and prevent the belief of any in future. And if after all this you can tru&s;t your&s;elf for pre&s;ence of mind and command of countenance, &s;o far as to de&s;cribe &s;ome dreadful apparition, I think the&s;e circum&s;tances, together with the di&s;|tance of the Abbey, and the intricacies of the fore&s;t could in|title me to con&s;ider this place as my ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>Louis agreed to all that his father had propo&s;ed, and on the following day executed his commi&s;&s;ion with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that the tranquillity of the abbey may be then &s;aid to have been en|tirely re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Thus ended this adventure, the only one that had occurred to di&s;turb the family, during their re&s;idence in the fore&s;t. Adeline removed from the apprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e evils, with which the late &s;ituation of La Motte had threatened her, and from the depre&s;&s;ion which her intere&s;t in his occa&s;ioned her, now experienced a more than u&s;ual complacency of mind. She thought too that &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b&s;erved in Madame La Motte a re|newal of her former kindne&s;s, and this circum&s;tance awakened all her gratitude, and imparted to her a plea&s;ure as lively as it was innocent. The &s;atisfaction with which the pre&s;ence of her &s;on in&s;pired Madame La Motte, Adeline mi&s;took for kind|ne&s;s to her&s;elf, and &s;he exerted her whole attention in an en|deavour to become worthy of it.</P>
<P>But the joy which his unexpected arrival had given to La Motte quickly began to evaporate, and the gloom of de&s;pon|dency again &s;ettled on his countenance. He returned fre|quently to his haunt in the fore&s;t&mdash;the &s;ame my&s;terious &s;adne&s;s tinctured his manner and revived the anxiety of Madame La Motte, who was re&s;olved to acquaint her &s;on with this &s;ubject of di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;olicit his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to penetrate its &s;ource.</P>
<P>Her jealou&s;y of Adeline, however, &s;he could not commu|nicate, though it again tormented her, and taught her to mi&s;|con&s;true with wonderful ingenuity every look and word of La Motte, and often to mi&s;take the artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions of Ade|line's
<PB N="68" REF="029379_0035_0FE08A48C863FEB8">
gratitude and regard, for tho&s;e of warmer tenderne&s;s. Adeline had formerly accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to long walks in the fore&s;t, and the de&s;ign Madame had formed of watching her &s;teps, had been fru&s;trated by the late circum&s;tances, and was now entirely overcome by a &s;en&s;e of its difficulty and dan|ger. To employ Peter in the affair, would be to acquaint him with her fears, and to follow her her&s;elf, would mo&s;t pro|bably betray her &s;cheme, by making Adeline aware of her jealou&s;y. Being thus re&s;trained by pride and delicacy, &s;he was obliged to endure the pangs of uncertainty concerning the greate&s;t part of her &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>To Louis, however, &s;he related the my&s;terious change in his father's temper. He li&s;tened to her account with very earne&s;t attention, and the &s;urpri&s;e and concern impre&s;&s;ed upon his countenance &s;poke how much his heart was intere&s;ted. He was however involved in equal perplexity with her&s;elf upon this &s;ubject, and readily undertook to ob&s;erve the motions of La Motte, believing his interference likely to be of equal &s;ervice both to his father and his mother. He &s;aw in &s;ome degree, the &s;u&s;picions of his mother, but as he thought &s;he wi&s;hed to di&s;gui&s;e her feelings, he &s;uffered her to believe that &s;he &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>He now inquired concerning Adeline, and li&s;tened to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> little hi&s;tory, of which his mother gave a brief relation, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> great apparent intere&s;t. So much pity did he expre&s;s fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her condition, and &s;o much indignation at the unnatural con+duct of her father, that the apprehen&s;ions which Madame La Motte began to form, of his having di&s;covered her jealou&s;y yielded to tho&s;e of a different kind. She perceived that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beauty of Adeline had alrady fa&s;cinated his imagination, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> feared that her amiable manners would &s;oon impre&s;s his hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Had her fir&s;t fondne&s;s for Adeline continued, &s;he would &s;till ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> looked with di&s;plea&s;ure upon their attachment, as an ob&s;tacle the promotion and the for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">une &s;he hoped to &s;ee one day e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+joyed by her &s;on.

She, therefore, touched lightly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on Adeline's merit, joined cooly with Louis in compa&s;&s;ionat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her misfortunes, and with her cen&s;ure of the father's cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mixed an implied &s;u&s;picion of that of Adeline's.

The indifference, which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed towards Ade+line,
<PB N="69" REF="029379_0035_0FE08A48C863FEB8">
increa&s;ed his pity for her de&s;titute condition, and the ten|derne&s;s, with which &s;he affected to judge the father, heighten|ed his hone&s;t indignation at his character.</P>
<P>As he quitted Madame La Motte, he &s;aw his father cro&s;s the lawn and enter the deep &s;hade of the fore&s;t on the left. He judged this to be a good opportunity of commencing his plan, and, quitting the abbey, &s;lowly followed at a di&s;tance. La Motte continued to walk &s;traight forward, and &s;eemed &s;o deeply wrapt in thought, that he looked neither to the right or left, and &s;carcely lifted his head from the ground. Louis had followed him near half a mile, when he &s;aw him &s;udden|ly &s;trike into an avenue of the fore&s;t, which took a different direction from the way he had hitherto gone. He quickened his &s;teps that he might not lo&s;e &s;ight of him, but, having reachd the avenue, found the trees &s;o thickly interwoven, that La Motte was already hid from his view.</P>
<P>He continued, however, to pur&s;ue the way before him: it conducted him through the mo&s;t gloomy part of the fore&s;t he had yet &s;een&punc; till at length it terminated in an ob&s;cure rece&s;s, overarched with high trees, who&s;e interwoven branches &s;eclud|ed the direct rays of the &s;un, and admitted only a &s;ort of &s;olemn twilight. Louis looked around in &s;earch of La Motte, but he was no where to be &s;een. While he &s;tood &s;urveying the place, and con&s;idering what farther &s;hould be done, he ob|&s;erved, through the gloom, an object at &s;ome di&s;tance, but the deep &s;hadow that fell around prevented his di&s;tingui&s;hing what it was.</P>
<P>In advancing, he perceived the ruins of a &s;mall building, which, from the traces that remained, appeared to have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omb. As he gazed upon it, "Here," &s;aid he, "are prob|ably depo&s;ited the a&s;hes of &s;ome ancient monk, once an in|habitant of the abbey; perhaps, of the founder, who after hav|ing &s;pent a life of ab&s;tinence and prayer, &s;ought in heaven the reward of his forbearance upon earth. Peace be to his &s;oul! but did he think a life of mere negative virtue de&s;erved an eternal reward? Mi&s;taken man! rea&s;on, had you tru&s;ted to its dictates, would have informed you, that the active virtues, the adherence to the golden rule, "Do as you would be done unto," could alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e de&s;erve the favour of a Diety, who&s;e glory is benevolence."</P>
<P>He remained with his eyes fixed upon the &s;pot, and pre|&s;ently &s;aw a figure ari&s;e under the arch of the &s;epulchre. It &s;tarted, as if on perceiving him, and immediately di&s;appeared.
<PB N="70" REF="029379_0036_0FE08A4EF89BBEB8">
Louis, though unu&s;ed to fear, felt at that moment an unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, but almo&s;t it immediately &s;truck him that this was La Motte him&s;elf. He advanced to the ruin and called him. No an&s;wer was returned, and he repeated the call, but all was yet &s;till as the grave. He then went up to the arch|way and endeavoured to examine the place where he had di&s;|appeared, but the &s;hadowy ob&s;curity rendered the attempt fruitle&s;s. He ob&s;erved, however, a little to the right, an en|trance to the ruin, and advanced &s;ome &s;teps down a dark kind of pa&s;&s;age, when recollecting that this place might be the haunt of banditti, his danger alarmed him, and he retreated with precipitation.</P>
<P>He walked toward the abbey by the way he came, and find|ing no per&s;on followed him, and believing him&s;elf again in &s;afety, his former &s;urmi&s;e returned, and he thought it was La Motte he had &s;een. He mu&s;ed upon this &s;trange po&s;&s;ibility, and endeavoured to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for &s;o my&s;terious a conduct, but in vain. Notwith&s;tanding this, his belief of it &s;trengthen|ed, and he entered the abbey under as full a conviction as the circum&s;tances would admit of, that it was his father who had appeared in the &s;epulchre. On entering what was now u&s;ed as a parlour, he was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find him quietly &s;eated there with Madame La Motte and Adeline, and conver&s;ing as if he had been returned for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>He took the fir&s;t opportunity of acquainting his mother with his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te adventure, and of inquiring how long La Motte had been returned before him, when learning that it was near half an hour, his &s;urpri&s;e increa&s;ed, and he knew not what to con|clude.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, a perception of the growing partiality of Louis co-operated with the canker of &s;u&s;picion, to de&s;troy in Madame La Motte that affection which pity and e&s;teem had formerly ex|cited for Adeline. Her unkindne&s;s was now too obvious to e&s;|cape the notice of her to whom it was directed, and being noticed, it occa&s;ioned an angui&s;h which Adeline found it very difficult to endure. With the warmth and candor of youth, the &s;ought an explanation of this change of behaviour, and an apportunity of exculpating her&s;elf from any intention of provoking it. But this Madame La Motte artfully evaded, while at the &s;ame time &s;he threw out hints, that involved Adeline in deeper per|plexity, and &s;erved to make her pre&s;ent affliction more intolerable.</P>
<P>"I have lo&s;t that affection," &s;he would &s;ay, "which was my all. It was my only comfort&mdash;yet I have lo&s;t it&mdash;and this
<PB N="71" REF="029379_0036_0FE08A4EF89BBEB8" MS="y">
without even knowing my offence. But I am thankful I have not merited unkindne&s;s, and, though <HI>&s;he</HI> has abandoned <HI>me,</HI> I &s;hall always love <HI>her.</HI>"</P>
<P>Thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, &s;he would frequently leave the parlour, and retiring to her chamber, would yield to a de&s;pondency, which &s;he had never known till now.</P>
<P>One morning, being unable to &s;leep, &s;he aro&s;e at a very early hour. The faint light of day now trembled through the clouds, and gradually &s;preading from the horizon, announced the ri&s;ing &s;un. Every feature of the land&s;cape was &s;lowly un|veiled, moi&s;t wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the dews of night, and brightening with the dawn, till at length the &s;un appeared and &s;hed the full flood of day. The beauty of the hour invited her to walk, and &s;he went forth into the fore&s;t to ta&s;te the &s;weets of morning.

<P>She wandered on without noticing the di&s;tance, and following the windings of the river, came to a dewey glade, who&s;e woods, &s;weeping down to the very edge of the water, formed a &s;cene &s;o &s;weetly romantic, that &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf at the foot of a tree, to contemplate its beauty.

<P>A di&s;tant echo lengthened out her tones, and &s;he &s;at li&s;ten|ing to the &s;oft re&s;pon&s;e, till repeating the la&s;t &s;tanza of the Sonnet, &s;he was an&s;wered by a voice almo&s;t as tender, and le&s;s di&s;tant. She looked round in &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;aw a young man in a hunter's dre&s;s, leaning again&s;t a tree, and gazing on her with that deep attention, which marks an enraptured mind.</P>

relea&s;ed. She re&s;olved, however, to refrain, for &s;ometime walking in the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>When &s;he came down to breakfa&s;t, &s;he ob&s;erved Madame La Motte to be more than u&s;ually re&s;erved. La Motte entered the room &s;oon after her, and made &s;ome trifling ob&s;ervations on the weather; and having endeavoured to &s;upport an effort at cheer|fulne&s;s, &s;unk into his u&s;ual melancholy. Adeline watched the countenance of Madame with anxiety; and when there appeared in it a gleam of kindne&s;s, it was as &s;un&s;hine to her &s;oul: but &s;he very &s;eldom &s;uffered Adeline thus to flatter her&s;elf. Her conver&s;ation was re&s;trained, and often pointed at &s;omething more than could be under&s;tood. The entrance of Louis was a very &s;ea&s;onable relief to Adeline, who almo&s;t feared to tru&s;t her voice with a &s;entence, le&s;t its trembling accents &s;hould betray her unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"This charming morning drew you early from your cham|ber," &s;aid Louis, addre&s;&s;ing Adeline. "You had, no doubt, a plea&s;ant companion too," &s;aid Madame La Motte, "a &s;olitary walk is &s;eldom agreeable."</P>
<P>"I was alone, Madame," replied, Adeline.</P>
<P>"Indeed your own thoughts mu&s;t be highly plea&s;ing then&middot;"</P>
<P>"Alas!" returned Adeline, a tear, &s;pite of her efforts, &s;tarting to her eye, "there are now few &s;ubjects of plea&s;ure left for them."</P>
<P>"That is, very &s;urpri&s;ing," pur&s;ued Madame La Motte.</P>
<P>"Is it indeed, &s;upri&s;ing Madame, for tho&s;e who have lo&s;t their la&s;t friend to be unhappy?"</P>
<P>Madame La Motte's con&s;cience acknowledged the rebuke, and &s;he blu&s;hed. "Well," re&s;umed &s;he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, "that is not your &s;ituation, Adeline;" looking earne&s;tly at La Motte. Adeline, who&s;e innocence protected her from &s;u&s;|picion, did not regard this circum&s;tance; but, &s;miling through her tears, &s;aid, &s;he rejoiced to hear her &s;ay &s;o. During this conver&s;ation, La Motte had remained ab&s;orbed in his own thoughts; and Louis, unable to gue&s;s at what it pointed, look|ed alternately at his Mother and Adeline for an explanation. The latter he regarded with an expre&s;&s;ion &s;o full of tender com|pa&s;&s;ion, that it revealed at once to Madame La Motte the &s;en|timents of his &s;oul; and &s;he immediately replied to the la&s;t words of Adeline with a very &s;erious air; "A friend is only e&s;timable when our conduct de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s one; the friend&s;hip that &s;urvives the merit of its object, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s a di&s;grace in&s;tead of an honour, to both parties."</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="029379_0038_0FE08A616800F780">The manner and empha&s;is with which &s;he delivered the&s;e words, again alarmed Adeline, who mildly &s;aid, "&s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould never de&s;erve &s;uch cen&s;ure." Madame was &s;ilent; but Adeline was &s;o much &s;hocked by what had already pa&s;&s;ed, that tears &s;prung from her eyes, and &s;he hid her face with her handkerchief.</P>
<P>Louis now ro&s;e with &s;ome emotion; and La Motte rou&s;ed from his reverie, inquired what was the matter; but, before he could receive an an&s;wer, he &s;eemed to have forgot that he had a&s;ked the que&s;tion. "Adeline may give you her own account," &s;aid Madame La Motte. "I have not de&s;erved this," &s;aid Adeline, ri&s;ing, "but &s;ince my pre&s;ence is di&s;plea&s;ing, I will retire."</P>
<P>She moved towards the door, when Louis, who was pacing the room in apparent agitation gently took her hand, &s;aying, "Here is &s;ome unhappy mi&s;take," and would have led her to the &s;eat; but her &s;pirits were too much depre&s;&s;ed to endure longer re&s;traint; and, withdrawing her hand, "Suffer me to go;" &s;aid &s;he, "if there is any mi&s;take, I am unable to explain it." Saying this, &s;he quitted the room. Louis followed her with his eyes to the door; when, turning to his mother&punc; "Surely, Madam," &s;aid he, "you are to blame; my life o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it &s;he de|&s;erves your warme&s;t tenderne&s;s."</P>
<P>"You are very eloquent in her cau&s;e, Sir," &s;aid Madame, "may I pre&s;ume to a&s;k what has intere&s;ted you thus in her favour?"</P>
<P>"Her own amiable manners," rejoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Louis, "which no one can ob&s;erve without e&s;teeming them."</P>
<P>"But you may pre&s;ume too much on your own ob&s;ervations, it is po&s;&s;ible the&s;e amiable manners may deceive you."</P>
<P>"Your pardon, Madame; I may without pre&s;umption affirm they cannot deceive me."</P>
<P>"You have, no doubt, good rea&s;ons for this a&s;&s;ertion, and I perceive, by your admiration of this artle&s;s <HI>innocent,</HI> &s;he has &s;ucceeded in her de&s;ign of entrapping your heart."</P>
<P>"Without de&s;igning it, &s;he has won my admiration, which would not have been the ca&s;e, had &s;he been capable of the conduct you mention."</P>
<P>Madame La Motte was going to reply, but was preven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by her hu&s;band, who, again rou&s;ed from his reverie, inquire into the cau&s;e of di&s;pute: "Away with this ridiculous beha+viour," &s;aid he, in a voice of di&s;plea&s;ure. "Adeline has omit|ted &s;ome hou&s;ehold duty I &s;uppo&s;e, and an o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nce &s;o heni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;erves &s;evere puni&s;hment no doubt; but let one be no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

di&s;turbed with your petty quarrels; if you mu&s;t be tyrannical, Madame, indulge your humour in private."</P>
<P>Saying this&punc; he abruptly quitted the room, and Louis imme|diately following, Madame was left to her own unplea&s;ant re|flections. Her ill humour proceeded from the u&s;ual cau&s;e. She had heard of Adeline's walk; and La Motte having gone forth into the fore&s;t at an early hour, her imagination, heated by the broodings of jealou&s;y, &s;ugge&s;ted that they had appointed a meeting. This was confirmed to her by the entrance of Adeline, quickly followed by La Motte; and her perceptions thus jaundiced by pa&s;&s;ion, neither the pre&s;ence of her &s;on nor her u&s;ual attention to good manners, had been able to re&s;train her emotions. The behaviour of Adeline in the late &s;cene, &s;he con&s;idered as a refined piece of art; and the indifference of La Motte as affected. So true it is, that
<Q><L>&mdash;"Trifles, light as air,</L>
<L>Are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> jealous, confirmations &s;trong</L>
<L>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> proofs of Holy Writ,"</L></Q>
And &s;o ingenious was &s;he "to twi&s;t the true cau&s;e the wrong way."</P>
<P>Adeline had retired to her chamber to we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p. When her fir&s;t agitations were &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he took an ample view of her conduct; and, perceiving nothing of which &s;he could accu&s;e her&s;elf, &s;he became more &s;atisfied deriving her be&s;t comfort from the integ|rity of her intentions. In the moment of accu&s;ation, innocence may &s;ometimes he oppre&s;&s;ed with the puni&s;hment due only to guilt; but reflection di&s;&s;olves the illu&s;ion of terror, and bring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the aching bo&s;om, the con&s;olations or virtue.</P>
<P>When La Motte quitted the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oom, he had gone into the fore&s;t, which Louis ob&s;erving, he followed and joined him, with an intention of touching upon the &s;ubject of his melancholy. "It is a fine morning, Sir," &s;aid Louis, "if you will give me leave, I will walk with you." La Motte, though di&s;&s;atisfied, did not object; and after they had proceeded &s;ome way, he changed the cour&s;e of his walk, &s;triking into a path, contrary to that which Louis had ob&s;erved him take on the foregoing day.</P>
<P>Louis remarked that the avenue they had quitted was "more &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and therefore more plea&s;ant." La Motte not &s;eeming to notice this remark, "It leads to a &s;ingular &s;pot," continued he, "which I di&s;covered ye&s;terday." La Motte rai&s;ed his head; Louis proceeded to de&s;cribe the tomb, and the adventure he had met with: during this relation, La Motte regarded him with attention, while his own countenance &s;uffered various changes
<PB N="76" REF="029379_0039_0FE08A6EF9911B38">
When he had concluded. "You are very daring," &s;aid La Motte, "to examine that place, particularly when you ventured down the pa&s;&s;age: I would advi&s;e you to be more cautious how you penetrate the depths of this fore&s;t. I, my&s;elf, have not ventured beyond a certain boundary; and am&punc; therefore, uninformed what inhabitants it may harbour. "Your account has alarmed me," continued he, "for if banditti are in the neighbourhood, I am not &s;afe from their depredations: 'tis true, "I have but little to lo&s;e, except my life."</P>
<P>"And the lives of your family," rejoined Louis&mdash;"Of cour&s;e," &s;aid La Motte.</P>
<P>"It would be well to have more certainty upon that head," rejoined Louis, "I am con&s;idering how we may obtain it."</P>
<P>"'Tis u&s;ele&s;s to con&s;ider that," &s;aid La Motte, "the inquiry it&s;elf brings danger with it; your life perhaps, would be paid for the indulgence of your curio&s;ity; our only chance of &s;afety is by endeavouring to remain undi&s;covered. Let us move tow|ards the abbey."</P>
<P>Louis knew not what to think, but &s;aid no more upon the &s;ubject. La Motte &s;oon after relap&s;ed into a fit of mu&s;ing; and his &s;on now took occa&s;ion to lament that depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, which he had lately ob&s;erved in him. "Rather lament the cau&s;e of it," &s;aid La Motte with a &s;igh: "That I do, mo&s;t &s;incerely, whatever it may be. May I venture to inquire, Sir, what is this cau&s;e?</P>
<P>"Are, then, my misfortunes &s;o little known to you," rejoined La Motte, as to make that que&s;tion nece&s;&s;ary? "Am I not driven from my home, from my friends, and almo&s;t from my country? And &s;hall it be a&s;ked why I am afflicted?" Louis felt the ju&s;tice of this reproof, and was a moment &s;ilent. "That you are afflicted, Sir, does not excite my &s;urpri&s;e;" re&s;umed he, "it would indeed be &s;trange, were you not."</P>
<P>"What then does excite your &s;urpri&s;e?"</P>
<P>"The air of cheerfulne&s;s you wore when I fir&s;t came hither."</P>
<P>"You lately lamented that I was afflicted," &s;aid La Motte, "and now &s;eem not very well plea&s;ed that I was once cheerful. What is the meaning of this?"</P>
<P>"You much mi&s;take me," &s;aid his &s;on, "nothing could give me &s;o much &s;atisfaction as to &s;ee that cheerfulne&s;s renewed; the &s;ame cau&s;e of &s;orrow exi&s;ted at that time, yet you was then cheerful."</P>
<P>"That I was then cheerful," &s;aid La Motte, "you might, without flattery, have attributed to your&s;elf; your pre&s;ence
<PB N="77" REF="029379_0039_0FE08A6EF9911B38">
revived me, and I was relieved at the &s;ame time from a load of apprehen&s;ions."</P>
<P>"Why, then, as the &s;ame cau&s;e exi&s;ts, are you not &s;till cherful?"</P>
<P>"And why do you not recollect that it is your father you thus &s;peak to?"</P>
<P>"I do, Sir, and nothing but anxiety for my father, could have urged me thus far; it is with inexpre&s;&s;ible concern I per|ceive you have &s;ome &s;ecret cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s; reveal it, Sir, to tho&s;e who claim a &s;hare in all your affliction, and &s;uffer them, by participation, to &s;often its &s;everity." Louis looked up, and ob&s;erved the countenance of his father, pale as death: his lips trembled while he &s;poke. "Your penetration, however, you may rely upon it, has in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, deceived you, I have no &s;ubject of di&s;tre&s;s, but what you are already acquainted with, and I de&s;ire this conver&s;ation may never be renewed."</P>
<P>"If it is your de&s;ire, of cour&s;e, I obey," &s;aid Louis, "but, pardon me, Sir, if"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I will not pardon you, Sir," interrupted La Motte, "let the di&s;cour&s;e end here." Saying this he quickened his &s;teps, and Louis not daring to pur&s;ue, walked quietly on till he reached the abbey.</P>
<P>Adeline pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the day alone in her cham|ber, where having examined her conduct, &s;he endeavoured to for|tify her heart again&s;t the unmerited di&s;plea&s;ure of Madame La Motte. This was a ta&s;k more difficult than that of &s;elf ac|quaintance. She loved her and had relied on her friend&s;hip, which, notwith&s;tanding the conduct of Madame, &s;till appeared valuable to her. It was true, &s;he had not de&s;erved to lo&s;e it, but Madame was &s;o aver&s;e to explanation, that there was little probability of recovering it, however ill-founded might be the cau&s;e of her di&s;like. At length, &s;he rea&s;oned, or rather per|haps, per&s;uaded her&s;elf into tolerable compo&s;ure; for to re&s;ign a real good with contentment, is le&s;s an effort of rea&s;on than of temper.</P>
<P>For many hours &s;he bu&s;ied her&s;elf upon a piece of work, which &s;he had undertaken for Madame La Motte; and this &s;he did, without the lea&s;t intention of conciliating her favour, but becau&s;e &s;he felt there was &s;omething in thus repaying unkind|ne&s;s, which was &s;uitable to her own temper, her &s;entiments, and her pride. Self-love <HI>may</HI> be the centre, round which the human affections move, for whatever motive conduces to &s;elf-gratification may be re&s;olved into &s;elf-love; yet &s;ome of the&s;e affections are in their nature &s;o refined&mdash;that though we cannot
<PB N="78" REF="029379_0040_0FE08A739367F8C8">
deny their origin, they almo&s;t de&s;erve the name of virtue. Of this &s;pecies was that of Adeline.</P>
<P>In this employment and in reading Adeline, pa&s;&s;ed as much of the day as po&s;&s;ible. From books, indeed, &s;he had con&s;tantly derived her chief information and amu&s;ement: tho&s;e belonging to La Motte were few, but well cho&s;en; and Adeline could find plea&s;ure in reading them more than once. When her mind was di&s;compo&s;ed by the behaviour of Madame La Motte, or by a retro&s;pection of her early misfortunes, a book was the opiate that lull'd it to repo&s;e. La Motte, had &s;everal of the be&s;t Engli&s;h poets, a language which Adeline had learned in the convent; their beauties, therefore, &s;he was capable of ta&s;t|ing, and they often in&s;pired her with enthu&s;ia&s;tic delight.</P>
<P>At the decline of day, &s;he quitted her chamber to enjoy the &s;weet evening hour, but &s;trayed no farther than an evenue near the abbey, which fronted the we&s;t. She read a little, but find|ing it impo&s;&s;ible any longer to ab&s;tract her attention from the &s;cene around, &s;he clo&s;ed the book, and yielded to the &s;weet complacent melancholy which the hour in&s;pired. The air was &s;till, the &s;un, &s;inking below the di&s;tant hill, &s;pread a purple glow over the land&s;cape, and touched the fore&s;t glades with &s;ofter light. A dewy fre&s;hne&s;s was diffu&s;ed upon the air. As the &s;un de&s;cended, the du&s;k came &s;ilently on, and the &s;cene a&s;|&s;umed a &s;olemn grandeur. As &s;he mu&s;ed, &s;he recollected and repeated the following &s;tanzas:

<P>On her return to the abbey &s;he was joined by Louis, who, after &s;ome conver&s;ation, &s;aid, "I am much grieved by the &s;cene to which I was witne&s;s this morning, and have longed for an opportunity of telling you &s;o. My mother's behaviour is too my&s;terious to be accounted for, but it is not difficult to perceive &s;he labours under &s;ome mi&s;take. What I have to re|que&s;t is, that whenever I can be of &s;ervice to you, you will command me."</P>
<P>Adeline thanked him for his friendly offer, which &s;he felt more &s;en&s;ibly than &s;he cho&s;e to expre&s;s. "I am uncon&s;cious," &s;aid &s;he, "of any offence that may have de&s;erved Madame La Motte's di&s;plea&s;ure, and am therefore, totally unable to account for it. I have repeatedly &s;ought an explanation, which &s;he has as anxiou&s;ly avoided; it is better therefore, to pre&s;s the &s;ubject no farther. At the &s;ame time Sir, &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;ure you, I have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of your goodne&s;s." Louis &s;ighed, and was &s;ilent. At length, "I wi&s;h you would permit me," re|&s;umed he to &s;peak with my mother upon this &s;ubject. I am &s;ure I could convince her of her error."</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="029379_0041_0FE08A80137ADCB8">"By no means," replied Adeline, "Madame La Motte's di&s;plea&s;ure has given me inexpre&s;&s;ible concern; but to com|pel her to an explanation would only increa&s;e this di&s;plea&s;ure, in&s;tead of removing it. Let me beg of you not to attempt it."</P>
<P>"I &s;ubmit to your judgment," &s;aid Louis, "but, for once, it is with reluctance. I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf mo&s;t happy, if I could be of &s;ervice to you." He &s;poke this with an accent &s;o tender, that Adeline, for the fir&s;t time, perceived the &s;entiments of his heart. A mind more fraught with vanity than her's would have taught her long ago to regard the attentions of Louis, as the re&s;ult of &s;omething more than well bred gallan|try.

<BIBL>MACBETH.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NEAR a month elap&s;ed without any remarkable occur|rence: the melancholy of La Motte &s;uffered little abatement; and the behaviour of Madame to Adeline, though &s;omewhat &s;oftened, was &s;till far from kind. Louis, by numberle&s;s little attentions, te&s;tified his growing affection for Adeline who con|tinued to treat them as pa&s;&s;ing civilities.</P>
<P>It happened, one &s;tormy night, as they were preparing for re&s;t, that they were alarmed by a trampling of hor&s;es near the abbey. The &s;ound of &s;everal voices &s;ucceeded, and a loud knocking at the great gate of the hall &s;oon after confirmed the alarm. La Motte had little doubt that the officers of ju&s;tice had at length di&s;covered his retreat, and the perturbation of fear almo&s;t confounded his &s;en&s;es; he, however ordered the lights to be extingui&s;hed, and a profound &s;ilence to be ob&s;erved, unwillin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to neglect even the &s;lighte&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ecurity. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was a chance, he thought, that the per&s;ons might &s;uppo&s;e the place uninhabited, and believe they had mi&s;taken the object of their &s;earch. His orders were &s;carcely obeyed when the knocking was renewed, and with increa&s;ed violence.
<PB N="81" REF="029379_0041_0FE08A80137ADCB8">
Motte now repaired to a &s;mall grated window in the portal of the gate, that he might ob&s;erve the number and appearance of the &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The darkne&s;s of the night baffled his purpo&s;e; he could on|ly perceive a groupe of men on hor&s;eback; but, li&s;tening at|tentively, he di&s;tingui&s;hed a part of their di&s;cour&s;e. Several of the men contended, that they had mi&s;taken the place; till a per&s;on, who from h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> authoritative voice appeared to be their leader, affirmed, that the lights had i&s;&s;ued from this &s;pot, and he was po&s;itive there were per&s;ons within. Having &s;aid this, he again knocked loudly at the gate, and was an&s;wered only by hollow echoes. La Motte's heart trembled at the &s;ound, and he was unable to move.</P>
<P>After waiting &s;ome time, the &s;trangers &s;eemed as if in con|&s;ultation, but their di&s;cour&s;e was conducted in &s;uch a low tone of voice, that La Motte was unable to di&s;tingui&s;h its purport. They withdrew from the gate, as if to depart, but he pre&s;ently thought he heard them among&s;t the trees on the other &s;ide of the fabric, and &s;oon became convinced they had not left the abbey. A few minutes held La Motte in a &s;tate of torturing &s;u&s;pence; he quitted the grate, where Louis now &s;tationed him|&s;elf, for that part of the edifice which overlooked the &s;pot where he &s;uppo&s;ed them to be waiting.</P>
<P>The &s;torm was now loud, and the hollow bla&s;ts, which ru&s;hed among the trees, prevented his di&s;tingui&s;hing any other &s;ound. Once in the pau&s;es of the wind, he thought he heard di&s;tinct voices; but he was not long left to conjecture, for the renewed knocking at the gate again appalled him; and re|gardle&s;s of the terrors of Madame La Motte and Adeline, &s;he ran to try his la&s;t chance of concealment, by means of the trap-door.</P>
<P>Soon after, the violence of the a&s;&s;ailants &s;eemed to increa&s;e with every gu&s;t of the tempe&s;t, the gate which was old and decayed, bur&s;t from its hinges, and admitted them to the hall. At the moment of their entrance, a &s;cream from Madame La Motte, who &s;tood at the door of an adjoining apart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, con|firmed the &s;u&s;picions of the principal &s;tranger, who continued to advance as fa&s;t as the darkne&s;s would permit him.</P>
<P>Adeline had fainted, and Madame La Motte was calling loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when Peter entered with lights, and di&s;covered the hall filled with men, and his young mi&s;tre&s;s &s;en&s;ele&s;s upon the floor. A chevalier now advanced, and &s;oliciting pardon of Madame for the rudene&s;s of his conduct, was attempting an
<PB N="82" REF="029379_0042_0FE08A84A7DF5DF0">
apology, when perceiving Adeline, he ha&s;tened to rai&s;e her from the ground, but Louis, who now returned, caught her in his arms, and de&s;ired the &s;tranger not to interfere.</P>
<P>The per&s;on to whom he &s;poke this, wore the &s;tar of one of the fir&s;t orders in France, and had an air of dignity, which de|clared him to be of &s;uperior rank. He appeared to be about forty, but perhaps, the &s;pirit and fire of his countenance made the impre&s;&s;ion of time upon his features le&s;s perceptible. His &s;oftened a&s;pect and in&s;inuating manners, while regardle&s;s of him&s;elf he &s;eemed attentive only to the condition of Adeline, gradually di&s;&s;ipated the apprehen&s;ions of Madame La Motte, and &s;ubdued the &s;udden re&s;entment of Louis. Upon Adeline, who was yet in&s;en&s;ible, he gazed with an eager admiration, which &s;eemed to ab&s;orb all the faculties of his mind. She was, indeed, an object not to be contemplated with indifference.</P>
<P>Her beauty, touched with the languid delicacy of illne&s;s, gained from &s;entiment what it lo&s;t in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">loom. The negligence of her dre&s;s, loo&s;ened for the purpo&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icer re&s;piration, di&s;|covered tho&s;e glowing charms, which her auburn tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that fell in profu&s;ion over her bo&s;om, &s;haded, but could not conceal.</P>
<P>There now entered another &s;tranger, a young Chevalier, who, having &s;poken ha&s;tily to the elder, joined the gener<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l groupe that &s;urrounded Adeline. He was of a per&s;on&punc; in which ele|gance was happily blended with &s;trength, and had a countenance a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">imated, but not haughty; noble, yet expre&s;&s;ive of pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uliar &s;weetne&s;s. What ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ered it at pre&s;ent more intere&s;ting, was the compa&s;&s;ion he &s;eemed to feel for Adeline, who now revived and &s;aw him, the fir&s;t object that met her eyes, bending over her in &s;ilent anxiety.</P>
<P>On perceiving him, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lu&s;h of quick &s;urpri&s;e pa&s;&s;ed over her cheek, for &s;he knew him to be the &s;tranger &s;he had &s;een in the fore&s;t Her countenance in&s;tantly changed to the pale|ne&s;s of terror, when &s;he ob&s;erved the room crowded with people. Louis now &s;upported her into another apartment&punc; where the two Chevaliers, who followed her, again apologized for the alarm they had occa&s;ioned. The elder, turning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Madame La Motte, &s;aid, "You are, no doubt, Madam, igno|rant that I am the proprietor of this abbey." She &s;tarted&punc; "Be not alarmed, Madame, you are &s;afe and welcome. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ruinous &s;pot has been long abandoned by me, and if it has af|forded you a &s;helter I am happy."</P>
<P>Madame La Motte expre&s;&s;ed her gratitude for this conde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;ion, and Louis declared his &s;en&s;e of the politene&s;s of the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Montalt, for that was the name of the noble &s;tranger.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="029379_0042_0FE08A84A7DF5DF0">"My chief re&s;idence," &s;aid the Marquis, "is in a di&s;tant province, but I have a chateau near the borders of the fore&s;t, and in returning from an excur&s;ion, I have been benighted and lo&s;t my way. A light which gleamed through the trees, attract|ed me hither, and, &s;uch was the darkne&s;s without, that I did not know it proceeded from the abbey till I came to the door." The noble deportment of the &s;trangers, the &s;plendour of their apparel, and above all, this &s;peech di&s;&s;ipated every remaining doubt of Madame's, and &s;he was giving orders for refre&s;hments to be &s;et before them, when La Motte, who had li&s;tened, and was now convinced he had nothing to fear, entered the apartment.</P>
<P>He advanced towards the Marquis with a complacent air, but as he would have &s;poke, the words of welcome faltered on his lips, his limbs trembled, and a gha&s;tly palene&s;s over&s;pread his countenance. The Marquis was little le&s;s agitated, and, in the fir&s;t moment of &s;urpri&s;e, put his hand upon his &s;word, but, recollecting him&s;elf, he withdrew it, and endeavoured to obtain a command of features. A pau&s;e of agonizing &s;ilence en&s;ued. La Motte made &s;ome motion towards the door, but his agitated frame refu&s;ed to &s;upport him, and he &s;unk into a chair, &s;ilent and exhau&s;ted. The horror of his countenance, together with his whole behaviour, excited the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e in Madame, who&s;e eyes inquired of the Marquis more than he thought proper to an&s;wer: his looks increa&s;ed, in&s;tead of ex|plaining the my&s;tery, and expre&s;&s;ed a mixture of emotions, which &s;he could not analy&s;e. Meanwhile, &s;he endeavoured to &s;oothe and revive her hu&s;band, but he repre&s;&s;ed her efforts, and averting his face, covered it with his hands.</P>
<P>The Marquis, &s;eeming to recover his pre&s;ence of mind, &s;tepped to the door of the hall where his people were a&s;&s;embled, when La Motte, &s;tarting from his &s;eat, with a frantic air, called on him to return. The Marquis looked back and &s;topped, but &s;till he&s;itating whether to proceed; the &s;upplica|tions of Adeline, who was now returned, added to tho&s;e of La Motte, determined him, and he &s;at down. "I reque&s;t of you, my Lord," &s;aid La Motte, "that we may conver&s;e for a few moments by our&s;elves."</P>
<P>"The reque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bold, and the indulgence, perhaps, danger|ous," &s;aid the Marquis: "it is more al&s;o than I will grant.

I entreat &mdash; I &s;upplicate of you a few moments private di&s;cour&s;e." As he pronounced the&s;e words, tears &s;welled into his eyes, and the Marquis, &s;oftened by his di&s;tre&s;s, con&s;ented, though with evident emotion and reluctance, to his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>La Motte took a light and led the Marquis to a &s;mall room in a remote part of the edifice, where they remained near an hour. Madame, alarmed by the length of their ab&s;ence, went in que&s;t of them: as &s;he drew near, a curio&s;ity, in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, perhaps not unju&s;tifiable, prompted her to li&s;ten. La Motte ju&s;t then exclaimed&mdash;"The phrenzy of de&s;pair!"&mdash; &s;ome words followed, delivered in a low tone, which &s;he could not under&s;tand&mdash;"I have &s;uffered more than I can expre&s;s," continued he; "the &s;ame image has pur&s;ued me in my mid|night dream, and in my daily wanderings. There is no pun|i&s;hment, &s;hort of death, which I would not have endured, to regain the &s;tate of mind, with which I entered this fore&s;t. I again addre&s;s my&s;elf to your compa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>A loud gu&s;t of wind, that bur&s;t along the pa&s;&s;age where Ma|dame La Motte &s;tood, overpowered his voice and that of the Marquis, who &s;poke in reply: but &s;he &s;oon after di&s;tingui&s;hed the&s;e words, &mdash;"To-morrow, my Lord, if you return to the&s;e ruins, I will lead you to the &s;pot."</P>
<P>"That is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary, and may be dangerous," &s;aid the Marquis. "From you my Lord, I can excu&s;e the&s;e doubts." re&s;umed La Motte; "but I will &s;wear whateve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you &s;hall propo&s;e.

<PB N="85" REF="029379_0043_0FE08A9360ED7D38">
with ha&s;ty &s;teps, and &s;ometimes lo&s;t in reverie. Meanwhile, the Marquis, &s;eating him&s;elf by Adeline, directed to her his whole attention, except when &s;udden fits of ab&s;ence came over his mind, and &s;u&s;pended him in &s;ilence: at the&s;e times the young Chevalier addre&s;&s;ed Adeline, who, with diffidence and &s;ome agitation, &s;hrunk from the ob&s;ervance of both.</P>
<P>The Marquis had been near two hours at the abbey, and the tempe&s;t &s;till continuing, Madame La Motte offered him a bed. A look from her hu&s;band made her tremble for the con&s;equence. Her offer was however, politely declined, the Marquis being evidently as impatient to be gone, as his tenant appeared di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed by his pre&s;ence, he often returned to the hall, and from the gates rai&s;ed a look of impatience to the clouds. Nothing was to be &s;een through the darkne&s;s of night &mdash;nothing heard but the howlings of the &s;torm.</P>
<P>The morning dawned before he departed. As he was pre|paring to leave the abbey, La Motte again drew him a&s;ide, and held him for a few moments in clo&s;e conver&s;ation. His im|pa&s;&s;ioned ge&s;tures, which Madame La Motte ob&s;erved from a remote part of the room, added to her curio&s;ity a degree of wild apprehen&s;ion, derived from the ob&s;curity of the &s;ubject. Her endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h the corre&s;ponding words, was baffled by the low voice in which they were uttered.</P>
<P>The Marquis and his retinue at length departed, and La Motte, having him&s;elf fa&s;tened the gates, &s;ilently and dejectedly withdrew to his chamber. The moment they were alone, Madame &s;eized the opportunity of entreating her hu&s;band to explain the &s;cene &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed. "A&s;k me no que&s;tions," &s;aid La Motte &s;ternly, "for I will an&s;wer none. I have already forbade you &s;peaking to me on this &s;ubject."</P>
<P>"What &s;ubject?" &s;aid his wife. La Motte &s;eemed to recol|lect him&s;elf&mdash;"No matter&mdash;I was mi&s;taken&mdash;I thought you had repeated the&s;e que&s;tions before."</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid Madame La Motte, "it is then as I &s;u&s;pected: your former melancholy, and the di&s;tre&s;s of this night, have the &s;ame cau&s;e."</P>
<P>"And why &s;hould you either &s;u&s;pect or inquire? am I al|ways to be per&s;ecuted with conjectures?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me, I meant not to per&s;ecute you; but my anxiety for your welfare will not &s;uffer me to re&s;t under this dreadful uncertainty. Let me claim the privilege of a wife, and &s;hare the affliction which oppre&s;&s;es you. Deny me not." La Motte interrupted her. Whatever may be the cau&s;e of the emotions
<PB N="86" REF="029379_0044_0FE08A9907DD84F0">
which you have witne&s;&s;ed, I &s;wear that I will not reveal it. A time may come, when I &s;hall no longer judge concealment nece&s;&s;ary; till then be &s;ilent, and de&s;i&s;t from importunity; above all, forbear to remark to any one what you may have &s;een uncommon in me. Bury your &s;urmi&s;e in your own bo&s;om, as you would avoid my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur&s;e and my "de&s;truction." The de|termined air with which he &s;poke this, while his countenance was over&s;pread with a livid hue, made his wife &s;hudder; and &s;he forbore all reply.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte retired to bed, but not to re&s;t. She ru|minated on the pa&s;t occurrence; and her &s;urpri&s;e and curio&s;ity, concerning the words and behavour of her hu&s;band, were but more &s;trongly &s;timulated by reflection. One truth, however, appeared; &s;he could not doubt but the my&s;terious conduct of La Motte, which had for &s;o many months oppre&s;&s;ed her with anxiety, and the late &s;cene with the Marquis, originated from the &s;ame cau&s;e. This belief which &s;eemed to prove how unju&s;tly &s;he had &s;u&s;pected Adeline, brought with it a pang of &s;elf accu&s;ation. She looked forward to the morrow, which would lead the Marquis again to the abbey with impatience. Wearied nature at length re&s;umed her rights, and yielded a &s;hort oblivion of care.</P>
<P>At a late hour, the next day, the family a&s;&s;embled to break|fa&s;t. Each individual of the party appeared &s;ilent and ab&s;tract|ed, but very different was the a&s;pect of their features, and &s;till more the complection of their thoughts. La Motte &s;eemed agitated by impatient fear, yet the &s;ullenne&s;s of de&s;pair over|&s;pread his countenance. A certain wildne&s;s in his eyes at times expre&s;&s;ed the &s;udden &s;tart of horror, and again his features would &s;ink into the gloom of de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte &s;eemed hara&s;&s;ed with anxiety; &s;he watch|ed every turn of her hu&s;band's countenance, and impatiently waited the arrival of the Marquis. Louis was compo&s;ed and thoughtful. Adeline &s;eemed to feel her full &s;hare of unea&s;ine&s;s. She had ob&s;erved the behaviour of La Motte the preceding night with much &s;urpri&s;e, and the happy confidence &s;he had hitherto repo&s;ed in him was &s;haken. She feared al&s;o, le&s;t the exigency of his circum&s;tances &s;hould precipitate him again i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the world, and that he would be either unable or unwilling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> afford her a &s;helter beneath his roof.</P>
<P>During breakfa&s;t, La Motte frequently ro&s;e to the window from whence he ca&s;t many an anxious look. His wife under+&s;tood too well the cau&s;e of his impatience, and endeavoured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="87" REF="029379_0044_0FE08A9907DD84F0">
repre&s;s her own. In the&s;e intervals, Louis attempted by whi&s;|pers to obtain &s;ome information from his father, but La Motte always returned to the table, where the pre&s;ence of Adeline pre|vented father di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, as he walked upon the lawn, Louis would have joined him, but La Motte preremptorily declared he in|tended to be alone, and &s;oon after, the Marquis having not yet arrived, proceeded to a greater di&s;tance from the abbey.</P>
<P>Adeline retired into their u&s;ual working room with Madame La Motte, who affected an air of cheerfulne&s;s, and even of kind|ne&s;s. Feeling the nece&s;&s;ity of offering &s;ome rea&s;on for the &s;triking agitation of La Motte, and of preventing the &s;urpri&s;e which the unexpected appearance of the Marquis would occa|&s;ion Adeline, if &s;he was left to connect it with his behaviour of the preceding night, &s;he mentioned that the Marquis and La Motte had long been known to each other, and that this unexpected meeting, after an ab&s;ence of many years, and under circum&s;tances &s;o altered and humiliating, on the part of the latter, had occa&s;ioned him much painful emotion. This had been heightened by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that the Marquis had for|merly mi&s;interpreted &s;ome circum&s;tances in his conduct towards him, which had cau&s;ed a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their intimacy.</P>
<P>This account did not bring conviction to the mind of Ade|line, for it &s;eemed inadequate to the degree of emotion, the Marquis and La Motte had mutually betrayed. Her &s;urpri&s;e was excited and her curio&s;ity awakened by the words which were mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o delude them both. But &s;he forbore to expre&s;s her thoughts.</P>
<P>Madame proceeding with her plan, &s;aid, "The Marquis was now expected, and &s;he hoped whatever differences remained, would be perfectly adju&s;ted." Adeline blu&s;hed, and endeavour|ing to reply, her lips faltered. Con&s;cious of this agitation, and of the ob&s;ervance of Madame La Motte, her confu&s;ion encrea&s;|ed, and her endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s &s;erved only to heighten it Still &s;he tried to renew the di&s;cour&s;e and &s;till &s;he found it im|po&s;&s;ible to collect her thoughts. Shocked left Madame &s;hould apprehend the &s;entiment which had till this moment been con|cealed almo&s;t from her&s;elf, her colour fled, &s;he fixed her eyes on the ground, and for &s;ome time found it difficult to re&s;pire. Madame La Motte inquired if &s;he was ill, when Adeline glad of the excu&s;e, withdrew to the indulgence of her own thoughts, which were now wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the expectation of &s;eeing again the young Chevalier, who had accompanied the Marquis.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="029379_0045_0FE08AA88DD6B598">As &s;he looked from her room, &s;he &s;aw the Marquis on hor&s;e|back, with &s;everal attendants, advancing at a di&s;tance, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ha&s;tened to appri&s;e Madame La Motte of his approach. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hort time he arrived at the gates, and Madame and Louis went out to receive him, La Motte being not yet returned. He entered the hall, followed by the young Chevalier, and acco&s;t|ing Madame with a &s;ort of &s;tately politene&s;s, inquired for La Motte, whom Louis now went to &s;eek.</P>
<P>The Marquis remained for a few minutes &s;ilent, and then a&s;ked of Madame La Motte "how her fair daughter did?" Madame under&s;tood it was Adeline he meant, and having an|&s;wered his inquiry, and &s;lightly &s;aid that &s;he was not related to them, Adeline, upon &s;ome indication of the Marquis's wi&s;h, was &s;ent for. She entered the room with a mode&s;t blu&s;h and a timed air, which &s;eemed to engage all his attention. His compliments &s;he received with a &s;weet grace, but, when the young Chevalier approached, the warmth of his manner render|ed hers involuntarily more re&s;erved, and &s;he &s;carcely dared to rai&s;e her eyes from the ground, le&s;t they &s;hould encounter his.</P>
<P>La Motte now entered and apologized for his ab&s;ence, which the Marquis noticed only by a &s;light inclin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion of his head, expre&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time by his looks, both di&s;tru&s;t and pride. They immediately quitted the abbey together, and the Marquis beckoned his attendants to follow at a di&s;tance. La Motte forbade his &s;on to accompany him, but Louis ob&s;erved he took the way into the thicke&s;t part of the fore&s;t. He was lo&s;t in a chaos of conjecture concerning this affair, but curio&s;ity and anxiety for his father induced him to follow at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the young &s;tranger, whom the Marquis addre&s;&s;ed by the name of Theodore, remained at the abbey with Madame La Motte and Adeline. The former with all her addre&s;s, could &s;carcely conceal her agitation during this interval. She moved involuntarily to the door, when|ever &s;he heard a foot&s;tep, and &s;everal times &s;he went to the hall door, in order to look into the fore&s;t, but as often re|turned, checked by di&s;appointment. No per&s;on appeared&punc; Theodore &s;eemed to addre&s;s as much of his attention to Ade|line, as politene&s;s would allow him to withdraw from Madame La Motte. His manners &s;o gentle, yet dignified, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ubdued her timidity, and bani&s;hed her re&s;erve. Her conver|&s;ation no longer &s;uffered a painful con&s;traint, but gradually di&s;|clo&s;ed the beauties of her mind, and &s;eemed to produce a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tual confidence. A &s;imilarity of &s;entiment &s;oon appeared, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="89" REF="029379_0045_0FE08AA88DD6B598">
Theodore, by the impatient plea&s;ure which animated his coun|tenance, &s;eemed frequently to anticipate the thought of Adeline</P>
<P>To them the ab&s;ence of the Marquis was &s;hort, though long to Madame La Motte, who&s;e countenance, brightened, when &s;he heard the trampling of hor&s;es at the gate</P>
<P>The Marquis appeared but for a moment, and pa&s;&s;ed on with La Motte to a private room, where they remained for &s;ome time in conference, immediately after which he departed. The|odore took leave of Adeline, who, as well as La Motte and Ma|dame, attended them to the gates, with an expre&s;&s;ion of tender regret, and, often as he went looked back upon the abbey, till the intervening branches entirely excluded it from his view.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ient glow of plea&s;ure diffu&s;ed over the cheek of Adeline di&s;appeared with the young &s;tranger, and &s;he &s;ighed as &s;he turned into the hall. The image of Theodore pur&s;ued her to her chamber; &s;he recollected with exactne&s;s every particular of his late conver&s;ation&mdash;his &s;entiments &s;o congenial with her own&mdash;his manners &s;o engaging&mdash;his countenance &s;o animated&mdash; &s;o ingenious and &s;o noble, in which manly dignity was blended with the &s;weetne&s;s of benevolence&mdash;th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e and every other grace, &s;he recollected, and a &s;oft melancholy &s;tole upon her heart. "I &s;hall &s;ee him no more," &s;aid &s;he. A &s;igh that followed, told her more of her heart than &s;he wi&s;hed to know. She blu&s;hed, and &s;ighed again, and then &s;uddenly recollecting, her&s;elf &s;he endeavoured to divert her thoughts to a different &s;ubject. La Motte's connection with the Marquis for &s;ome time engaged her attention, but, unable to develope the my&s;tery that attended it, &s;he &s;ought a refuge from her own reflections in the more plea&s;ing ones to be derived from books.</P>
<P>During this time, Louis, &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed at the ex|treme di&s;tre&s;s which his father had manife&s;ted upon the fir&s;t ap|pearance of the Marquis, addre&s;&s;ed him upon the &s;ubject. He had no doubt that the Marquis was intimately concerned in the event which made it nece&s;&s;ary for La Motte to leave Paris, and he &s;poke his thoughts without di&s;gui&s;e, lamenting at the &s;ame time the unlucky chance, which had brought him to &s;eek re|fuge in a place of all others, the lea&s;t capable of affording it&mdash; the e&s;tate of his enemy. La Motte did not contradict this opinion of his &s;on's, and joined in lamenting the evil fate which had conducted him thither.</P>
<P>The term of Louis's ab&s;ence from his regiment was now nearly expired, and he took occa&s;ion to expre&s;s his &s;orrow, that he mu&s;t &s;oon be obliged to leave his father in circum|&s;tances
<PB N="90" REF="029379_0046_0FE08AAD27B64280">
&s;o dangerous as the pre&s;ent. "I &s;hould leave you, Sir, with le&s;s pain," continued he, "w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re I knew the full extent of your misfortunes.

<P>"I have already an&s;wered you on this &s;ubject." &s;aid La Motte, "and forbade you to renew it. I am now obliged to tell you, I care not how &s;oon you depart, if I am to be &s;ubjected to the&s;e inquiries." La Motte walked abruptly away, and left his &s;on to doubt and concern.</P>
<P>The arrival of the Marquis had di&s;&s;ipated the jealous fears of Madame La Motte, and &s;he awoke to a &s;en&s;e of her cruelty to|wards Adeline, When &s;he con&s;idered her orphan &s;tate&mdash;the uniform affection which had appeared in her behaviour&mdash;the mildne&s;s and patience with which &s;he had borne her injurious treatment, &s;he was &s;hocked, and took an early opportunity of renewing her former kindne&s;s. But &s;he could not explain this &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eming incon&s;i&s;tency of conduct without betraying her late &s;u&s;picions, which &s;he now blu&s;hed to remember, nor could &s;he apologize for her former behaviour, without giving this expla|nation.</P>
<P>She contented her&s;elf, therefore, with expre&s;&s;ing in her man|ner the regard which was thus revived. Adeline was at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed, but &s;he felt too much plea&s;ure at the change to be &s;crupulous in inquiring its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the &s;atisfaction which Adeline received from the revival of Madame La Motte's kindne&s;s, her thoughts frequently recurred to the peculiar and forlorn circum&s;tances of her condition. She could not help feeling le&s;s confidence than &s;he had formerly done in the friend&s;hip of Madame La Motte, who&s;e character now appeared le&s;s amiable than her imagina|tion had repre&s;ented it, and &s;eemed &s;trongly tinctured with ca|price. Her thoughts often dwelt upon the &s;trange introduc|tion of the Marquis at the abbey, and on the mutual emotions and apparent di&s;like of La Motte and him&s;elf; and, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, it equally excited her &s;urpri&s;e that La Motte &s;hould chu&s;e, and that the Marquis &s;hould permit him, to re|main in his territory.</P>
<P>Her mind returned the oftner, perhaps to this &s;ubject, be|cau&s;e it was connected with Theodore; but it returned uncon|&s;cious of the idea which attracted it. She attributed the intere&s;t &s;he felt in the affair, to her anxiety for the welfare of La Motte,

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A FEW days after the occurrence related in the preceding chapter, as Adeline was alone in her chamber, &s;he was rou&s;ed from a reverie by a trampling of hor&s;es near the gate, and, on looking from the ca&s;ement, &s;he &s;aw the Marquis de Montalt enter the abbey. This circum&s;tance &s;urpri&s;ed her, and an emotion, who&s;e cau&s;e &s;he did not trouble her&s;elf to inquire for, made her in&s;tantly retreat from the window. The &s;ame cau&s;e however, led her thither again as ha&s;tily, but the object of her &s;earch did not appear, and &s;he was in no ha&s;te to retire.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;tood mu&s;ing and di&s;appointed, the Marquis came out with La Motte, and immediately looking up, &s;aw Adeline and bowed. She returned his compliment re&s;pectfully, and with|drew from the window, vexed at having been &s;een there. They went into the fore&s;t, but the Marquis's attendants did not, as before, follow them thither. When they returned, which was not till after a con&s;iderable time, the Marquis immediately mounted his hor&s;e and rode away.</P>
<P>For the remainder of the day, La Motte appeared gloomy and &s;ilent, and was frequently lo&s;t in thought. Adeline ob&s;erved him with particular attention and concern; &s;he perceived that he was always more melancholy after an interview with the Marquis, and was now &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that the latter had ap|pointed to dine the next day at the abbey.</P>
<P>When La Motte mentioned this, he added &s;ome high eulo|giums on the character of the Marquis, and particularly prai&s;ed his genero&s;ity and noblene&s;s of &s;oul. At this in&s;tant, Adeline recollected the anecdotes &s;he had formerly heard concerning the abbey, and they threw a &s;hadow over the brightne&s;s of that excellence, which La Motte now celebrated. The account how|ever,
<PB N="92" REF="029379_0047_0FE08ABB86C951E8">
did not appear to de&s;erve much credit; a part of it, as far as a negative will admit of demon&s;tration, having been already proved fal&s;e; for it had been reported, that the abbey was haunted, and no &s;upernatural appearance had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver been ob&s;erved by the pre&s;ent inhabitants.</P>
<P>Adeline, however, ventured to inquire, whether it was the pre&s;ent Marquis of whom tho&s;e injurious reports had been rai&s;ed? La Motte an&s;wered her with a &s;mile of ridicule; "Stories of gho&s;ts and hobgoblins have always been admired and cheri&s;hed by the vulgar," &s;aid he. "I am inclined to rely upon my own experience, at lea&s;t as much as upon the accounts of the&s;e pea|&s;ants, if you have &s;een any thing to corroborate the&s;e accounts, pray inform me of it, that I may e&s;tabli&s;h my faith."</P>
<P>"You mi&s;take me, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "it was not concerning &s;upernatural agency that I would inquire: I alluded to a dif|ferent part of the report, which hinted, that &s;ome per&s;on had been confined here, by order of the Marquis, who was &s;aid to have died unfairly. "This was alleged as a rea&s;on for the Marquis's having abandoned the abbey."</P>
<P>"All the mere coinage of idlene&s;s," &s;aid La Motte; "a romantic tale to excite wonder: to &s;ee the Marquis is alone &s;ufficient to refute this; and if we credit half the number of tho&s;e &s;tories that &s;pring from the &s;ame &s;ource, we prove our|&s;elves little &s;uperior to the &s;impletons who invent them. Your good &s;en&s;e, Adeline, I think, will teach you the merit of di&s;belief."</P>
<P>Adeline blu&s;hed and was &s;ilent; but La Motte's defence of the Marquis appeared much warmer and more diffu&s;e than was con&s;i&s;tent with his own di&s;po&s;ition, or required by the occa&s;ion. His former conver&s;ation with Louis occurred to her, and &s;he was the more &s;urpri&s;ed at what pa&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>She looked forward to the morrow with a mixture of pain and plea&s;ure; the expectation of &s;eeing again the young Che|valier occupying her thoughts, and agitating them with vari|ous emotions: now &s;he feared his pre&s;ence, and now &s;he doubted whether he would come. At length &s;he ob&s;erved this, and blu&s;hed to find how much he engaged her attention. The mor|row arrived&mdash;the Marquis came&mdash;but he came alone; and the &s;un&s;hine of Adeline's mind was clouded, though &s;he was able to wear her u&s;ual air of cheerfulne&s;s. The Marquis was polite, af|fable, and attentive; to manners the mo&s;t ea&s;y and elegant, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> added the la&s;t refinement of poli&s;hed life. His conver&s;ation was lively, amu&s;ing, &s;ometimes even witty; and di&s;covered great
<PB N="93" REF="029379_0047_0FE08ABB86C951E8">
knowledge of the world; or, what is often mi&s;taken for it, an acquaintance with the higher circles, and with the topics of the day.</P>
<P>Here La Motte <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o qualified to conver&s;e with him, and they entered into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the characters and manners of the age with great &s;pirit and &s;ome humour. Madame La Motte had not &s;een her hu&s;band &s;o cheerful &s;ince they left Paris, and &s;ometimes &s;he could almo&s;t fancy &s;he was there. Adeline li&s;tened, till the cheerfulne&s;s, which &s;he had fir&s;t only a&s;&s;umed, became real. The addre&s;s of the Marquis was &s;o in&s;inuating and affa|ble, that her re&s;erve in&s;en&s;ibly gave way before it, and her natural vivacity re&s;umed its long lo&s;t empire.</P>
<P>At parting, the Marquis told La Motte he rejoiced at having found &s;o agreeable a neighbour. La Motte bowed. I &s;hall &s;ometimes vi&s;it you," continued he, "and I lament that I can|not at pre&s;ent invite Madame La Motte, and her fair friend, to my chateau, but it is undergoing &s;ome repairs, which make it but an uncomfortable re&s;idence."</P>
<P>The vivacity of La Motte di&s;appeared with his gue&s;t, and he &s;oon relap&s;ed into fits of &s;ilence and ab&s;traction. "The Mar|quis is a very agreeable man," &s;aid Madame La Motte. "Very agreeable," replyed he. "And &s;eems to have an excellent heart," &s;he re&s;umed. "An excellent one," &s;aid La Motte.</P>
<P>"You &s;eem di&s;compo&s;ed, my dear; what has di&s;turbed you?"</P>
<P>"Not in the lea&s;t&mdash;I was only thinking, that with &s;uch agreeable talents, and &s;uch an excellent heart, it was a pity the Marquis &s;hould&mdash;</P>
<P>"What? my dear," &s;aid Madame with impatience: "That the Marquis &s;hould&mdash;&s;hould &s;uffer this abbey to fall into ruins," replied La Motte.</P>
<P>"Is that all!" &s;aid Madame with di&s;appointment&mdash;"That is all, upon my honour," &s;aid La Mottte, and left the room.</P>
<P>Adeline's &s;pirits, no longer &s;upported by the animated con|ver&s;ation of the Marquis, &s;unk into langour, and when he de|parted, &s;he walked pen&s;ively into the fore&s;t. She followed a little romantic path that wound along the margin of the &s;tream, and was overhung with deep &s;hades. The tranquillity of the &s;cene, which autumn now touched with her &s;weete&s;t tints, &s;oftened her mind to a tender kind of melancholy, and &s;he &s;uffered a tear, which, &s;he knew not wherefore, had &s;tolen into her eye to tremble there unchecked. She came to a little lonely rece&s;s, formed by high trees; the wind &s;ighed mournfully among the branches, and as it waved their lofty heads &s;cattered their
<PB N="94" REF="029379_0048_0FE08AC1C25F5490">
leaves to the ground. She &s;eated her&s;elf on a bank beneath, and indulged the melancholy reflection that pre&s;&s;ed on her mind.</P>
<P>"O! could I dive into futurity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the events which await me!" &s;aid &s;he; "I &s;hould, perha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by con&s;tant contem|plation, be enabled to meet them with fortitude. An orphan in this wide world&mdash;thrown upon the friend&s;hip of &s;trangers for comfort, and upon their bounty for the very means of exi&s;tence, what but evil have I to expect! Alas, my father! how could you thus abandon your child&mdash;how leave her to the &s;torms of life&mdash;to &s;ink perhaps, beneath them? Alas, I have no friend!"</P>
<P>She was inturrupted by a ru&s;tling among the fallen leaves; &s;he turned her head, and perceiving the Marquis's young friend, aro&s;e to depart. "Pardon this intru&s;ion," &s;aid he, "your voice attracted me hither, and your words detained me; my offence, however, brings with it its own puni&s;hment, having learned your &s;orrows&mdash;how can I help feeling them my&s;elf? would that my &s;ympathy, or my &s;uffering, could re&s;cue you from them!" He he&s;itated&mdash;"Would that I could de&s;erve the title of your friend, and be thought worthy of it by your&s;elf!"</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of Adeline's thoughts could &s;carcely permit her to reply; &s;he trembled and gently withdrew her hand, which he had taken while he &s;poke. "You have, perhaps heard, Sir, more than is true: I am, indeed, not happy, but a moment of dejection has made me unju&s;t, and I am le&s;s unfor|tunate than I have repre&s;ented. When I &s;aid I had no friend, I was ungrateful to the kindne&s;s of Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte, who have been more than friends&mdash;have been as parents to me."</P>
<P>"If &s;o, I honour them," cried Theodore with warmth; "and if I did not feel it to be pre&s;umption, I would a&s;k why you are unhappy?&mdash;But"&mdash;He pau&s;ed. Adeline, rai&s;ing her eyes, &s;aw him gazing upon her with inten&s;e and eager anxiety, and her looks were again fixed upon the ground. "I have pained you," &s;aid Theodore, "by an improper reque&s;t. Can you for|give me, and al&s;o when I add, that it was an intere&s;t in your welfare, which urged my inquiry?"</P>
<P>"Forgivene&s;s, Sir, it is unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k. I am certainly obliged by the compa&s;&s;ion you expre&s;s. But the evening is cold, if you plea&s;e, we will walk towards the abbey." As they moved on, Theodore was for &s;ome time &s;ilent. At length, "It was but lately that I &s;olicited your pardon," &s;aid he, "and I &s;hall now, perhaps, have need of it again; but you will do me the

ju&s;tice to believe, that I have a &s;trong, and, indeed, a pre&s;&s;ing rea&s;on to inquire how nearly you are related to Mon&s;ieur La Motte."</P>
<P>"We are not at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lated," &s;aid Adeline; "but the &s;ervice he has done me I can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver repay, and I hope my gratitude will teach me never to forget it."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid Theodore, &s;urpri&s;ed; "and may I a&s;k how long you have known him?"</P>
<P>"Rather, Sir, let me a&s;k why the&s;e que&s;tions are nece&s;&s;ary?"</P>
<P>"You are ju&s;t," &s;aid he, with an air of &s;elf condemnation, "my conduct has de&s;erved this reproof; I &s;hould have been more explicit." He looked as if his mind was labouring with &s;omething which he was unwilling to expre&s;s. "But you know not how delicately I am circum&s;tanced," continued he, "yet I will aver, that my que&s;tions are prompted by the ten|dere&s;t intere&s;t in your happine&s;s&mdash;and even by my fears for your &s;afety." Adeline &s;tarted. "I fear you are deceived," &s;aid he, "I fear there's danger near you."</P>
<P>Adeline &s;topped, and looking earne&s;tly at him, begged he would explain him&s;elf. She &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome mi&s;chief threat|ened La Motte; and Theodore continuing &s;ilent, &s;he repeated her reque&s;t. "If La Motte is concerned in this danger," &s;aid &s;he, "let me entreat you to acquaint him with it immediately. He has but too many misfortunes to apprehend."</P>
<P>"Excellent Adeline!" cried Theodore, "that heart mu&s;t be adamant that would injure you. How &s;hall I hint what I fear is too true, and how forbear to warn you of your danger with|out"&mdash;He was interrupted by a &s;tep among the trees, and pre|&s;ently after &s;aw La Motte cro&s;s into the path they were in. Ad|eline felt confu&s;ed at being thus &s;een with the Chevalier, and was ha&s;tening to join La Motte, but Theodore detained her, and entreated a moment's attention. "There is now no time to explain my&s;elf," &s;aid he; "yet what I would &s;ay is of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence to <HI>your&s;elf.</HI>"</P>
<P>"Promi&s;e, therefore, to meet me in &s;ome part of the fore&s;t at about this time to morrow evening, you will then, I hope, be convinced, that my conduct is directed, neither by common circum&s;tances, nor common regard." Adeline &s;huddered at the idea of making an appointment; &s;he he&s;itated, and at length entreated Theodore not to delay till to morrow an explanation which appeared to be &s;o important, but to follow La Motte and inform him of his danger immediately. "It is not with La Motte I would &s;peak," replied Theodore; "I know of no
<PB N="96" REF="029379_0049_0FE08AD1143366E8">
danger that threatens him&mdash;but approaches, be quick, lovely Adeline, and promi&s;e to meet me."</P>
<P>"I do promi&s;e," &s;aid Adeline, with a faltering voice; "I will come to the &s;pot where you found me this evening, an hour earlier to morrow." Saying this, &s;he withdrew her trembling hand, which Theodore had pre&s;&s;ed to his lips in token of acknowledgment, and he immediately di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>La Motte now approached Adeline, who, fearing that he had &s;een Theodore, was in &s;ome confu&s;ion, "Whither is Louis gone &s;o fa&s;t?" &s;aid La Motte. She rejoiced to find his mi&s;take, and &s;uffered him to remain in it. They walked pen&s;ively to|wards the abbey, where Adeline, too much occupied by her own thoughts to bear company, retired to her chamber. She ruminated upon the words of Theodore, and the more &s;he con&s;idered them, the more &s;he was perplexed. Sometimes &s;he blamed her&s;elf for having made an appointment, doubting whether he had not &s;olicited it for the purpo&s;e of pleading a pa&s;&s;ion; and now delicacy checked this thought, and made her vexed that &s;he had pre&s;umed upon having in&s;pired one. She recollected the &s;erious earne&s;tne&s;s of his voice and manner, when he entreated her to meet him; and as they convinced her of the importance of the &s;ubject, &s;he &s;huddered at a danger, which &s;he could not comprehend, looking forward to the morrow with anxious impatience.</P>
<P>Sometimes too a remembrance of the tender intere&s;t he had expre&s;&s;ed for her welfare, and of his corre&s;pondent look and air, would &s;teal acro&s;s her memory, awakening a plea&s;ing emotion and a latent hope that &s;he was not indifferent to him. From reflections like the&s;e &s;he was rou&s;ed by a &s;ummons to &s;upper&punc; the repa&s;t was a melancholy one, it being the la&s;t evening of Louis's &s;tay at the abbey. Adeline, who e&s;teemed him, regretted his departure, while his eyes were often bent on her with a look which &s;eemed to expre&s;s that he was about to leave the object of his affection. She endeavoured by her cheerfulne&s;s &s;o re-an|imate the whole party, and e&s;pecially Madame La Motte, who frequently &s;hed tears. "We &s;hall &s;oon meet again," &s;aid Ade|line, "I tru&s;t, in happier circum&s;tances." La Motte &s;ighed. The countenance of Louis brightened at her words, "Do you wi&s;h it,?" &s;aid he, with peculiar empha&s;is. "Mo&s;t certainly I do," &s;he replied. "Can you doubt my regard for my be&s;t friends?"</P>
<P>"I cannot doubt any thing that is good for you," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"You forget you have left Paris," &s;aid La Motte to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> while a &s;mile cro&s;&s;ed his face, "&s;uch a compliment would the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

be in character with the place&mdash;in the&s;e &s;olitary woods it is quite <HI>outr&eacute;.</HI>"</P>
<P>"The language of admiration is not always that of compli|ment, Sir," &s;aid Louis. Adeline, willing to change the di&s;|cour&s;e, a&s;ked to what part of France he was going. He replied, that his regiment was now at Peronne, and he &s;hould go im|mediately thither. After &s;ome mention of indifferent &s;ubjects, the family withdrew for the night to their &s;everal chambers.</P>
<P>The approaching departure of her &s;on occupied the thoughts of Madame La Motte, and &s;he appeared at breakfa&s;t with eyes &s;woln with weeping. The pale countenance of Louis &s;eemed to indicate that he had re&s;ted no better than his mother. When breakfa&s;t was over, Adeline retired for a while, that &s;he might not interrupt, by her pre&s;ence, their la&s;t conver&s;ation. As &s;he walked on the lawn before the abbey &s;he returned in thought to the occurrence of ye&s;terday evening, and her impa|tience for the appointed interview increa&s;ed. She was &s;oon joined by Louis. "It was unkind of you to leave us," &s;aid he, "in the la&s;t moments of my &s;tay. Could I hope that you would &s;ometimes remember me, when I am far away, I &s;hould depart with le&s;s &s;orrow." He then expre&s;&s;ed his concern at leaving her, and though he had hitherto armed him&s;elf with re&s;olution to forbear a direct avowal of an attachment, which mu&s;t be fruitle&s;s, his heart now yielded to the force of pa&s;&s;ion, and he told what Adeline every moment feared to hear.</P>
<P>"This declaration," &s;aid Adeline, endeavouring to overcome the agitation it excited, "gives me inexpre&s;&s;ible concern."</P>
<P>"O, &s;ay not &s;o!" interrupted Louis, "but give me &s;ome &s;lender hope to &s;upport me in the mi&s;eries of ab&s;ence. Say that you do not hate me&mdash;Say"&mdash;</P>
<P>"That I do mo&s;t readily &s;ay," replied Adeline, in a tremu|lous voice; "if it will give you plea&s;ure to be a&s;&s;ured of my e&s;teem and friend&s;hip&mdash;receive this a&s;&s;urance:&mdash;as the &s;on of my be&s;t benefactors, you are entitled to."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Name not benefits&punc;" &s;aid Louis, "your merits out run them all: and &s;uffer me to hope for a &s;entiment le&s;s cool than that of friend&s;hip, do as well as believe that I do not owe your approbation of me to the actions of others. I have long borne my pa&s;&s;ion in &s;ilence, becau&s;e I fore&s;aw the difficulties that would attend it, nay, I have even dared to endeavour to over|come it: I have dared to believe it po&s;&s;ible, forgive the &s;uppo|&s;ition that I could forget you&mdash;and"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="029379_0050_0FE08AD5A4CC4DA8">"You di&s;tre&s;s me," interrupted Adeline; "this is a conver|&s;ation which I ought not to hear. I am above di&s;gui&s;e, and, therefore, a&s;&s;ure you, that though your virtues will always com|mand my e&s;teem, you have nothing to hope from my love. Were it even otherwi&s;e, our circum&s;tances would effectually de|cide for us. If you are really my friend, you will rejoice that I am &s;pared this &s;truggle between affection and prudence. Let me hope al&s;o, that time will teach you to reduce love within the limits of friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Never!" cried Louis vehemently: "Were this po&s;&s;ible, my pa&s;&s;ion would be unworthy of its object." While he &s;poke, Adeline's favourite fawn came bounding towards her. This circum&s;tance affected Louis even to tears. "This little animal." &s;aid he, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, "fir&s;t conducted me to you: it was witne&s;s to that happy moment when I fir&s;t &s;aw you, &s;ur|rounded by attractions too powerful for my heart; that mo|ment is now fre&s;h in my memory, and the creature comes even to witne&s;s this &s;ad one of my departure." Grief interrupted his utterance.</P>
<P>When he recovered his voice, he &s;aid, "Adeline when you look upon your little favourite and care&s;s it, remember the un|happy Louis, who will then be far&mdash;far from you. Do not deny me the poor con&s;olation of believing this!"</P>
<P>"I &s;hall not require &s;uch a monitor to remind me of you," &s;aid Adeline, with a &s;mile; "your excellent parents and your own merits have &s;ufficient claim upon my remembrance. Could I &s;ee your natural good &s;en&s;e re&s;ume its influence over pa&s;&s;ion, my &s;atisfaction would equal my e&s;teem for you."</P>
<P>"Do not hope it," &s;aid Louis, "nor will I wi&s;h it&mdash;for pa&s;|&s;ion here is virtue." As he &s;poke he &s;aw La Motte turn round an angle of the abbey. The moments are precious," &s;aid he, "I am interrupted, O! Adeline, farewell! and &s;ay, that you will &s;ometimes think of me."</P>
<P>"Farewell," &s;aid Adeline, who was affected by his di&s;tre&s;s; "farewell! and peace attend you. I will think of you with the affection of a &s;i&s;ter."&mdash;He &s;ighed deeply, and pre&s;&s;ed her hand; when La Motte, winding round another projection of the ruin, again appeared. Adeline left them together, and withdrew o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her chamber, oppre&s;&s;ed by the &s;cene. Louis's pa&s;&s;ion and her e&s;teem were too &s;incere not to in&s;pire her with a &s;trong degre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of pity for his unhappy attachment. She remained in her chamber till he had quitted the abbey, unwilling to &s;ubject hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or her&s;elf to the pain of a formal parting.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="029379_0050_0FE08AD5A4CC4DA8">As evening and the hour of appointment drew nigh, Adeline's impatience increa&s;ed; yet, when the time arrived, her re&s;olu|tion failed, and &s;he faltered from her purpo&s;e. There was &s;omething of indelicacy and di&s;&s;imulation in an <HI>appointed</HI> inter|view, on her part, that &s;hocked her. She recollected the ten|derne&s;s of Theodore's manner, and &s;everal little circum&s;tances which &s;eemed to indicate that his heart was not unconcerned in the event. Again &s;he was inclined to doubt, whether he had not obtained her con&s;ent to this meeting, upon &s;ome groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picion; and &s;he almo&s;t determined not to go: yet it was po&s;&s;ible Theodore's a&s;&s;ertion might be &s;incere, and her danger re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l; the chance of this made her dedicate &s;cruples appear ridiculous; &s;he wondered that &s;he had for a moment &s;uffered them to weigh again&s;t &s;o &s;erious an intere&s;t, and blaming her&s;elf for the delay they had occa&s;ioned, ha&s;tened to the place of appointment.</P>
<P>The little path, which led to this &s;pot, was &s;ilent and &s;olita|ry, and when &s;he reached the rece&s;s, Theodore had not arriv|ed. A tran&s;ient pride made her unwilling he &s;hould find that &s;he was more punctual to his appointment than him&s;elf; and &s;he turned from the rece&s;s into a track, which wound among the trees to the right. Having walked &s;ome way, without &s;eeing any per&s;on, or hearing a foot&s;tep, &s;he returned; but he was not come, and &s;he again left the place. A &s;econd time &s;he came back, and Theodore was &s;till ab&s;ent. Recollecting the time at which &s;he had quitted the ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey, &s;he grew unea&s;y and calculated that the hour appointed was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow much exceeded. She was offended and perplexed; but &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on the turf, and was re&s;olved to wait the event. After remaining here ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l the fall of twilight in fruitle&s;s expectation, her pride became more alarmed; &s;he feared that he had di&s;covered &s;ome|thing of the partiality he had in&s;pired, and believing that he now treated her with purpo&s;ed neglect, &s;he quitted the place with di&s;gu&s;t and &s;elf accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>When the&s;e emotions &s;ub&s;ided, and rea&s;on re&s;umed its in|fluence, &s;he blu&s;hed for what &s;he termed this childi&s;h efferve&s;|cence of &s;elf love. She recollected, as if for the fir&s;t time, the&s;e words of Theodore: "I fear you are deceived, and that &s;ome danger is near you&punc;" Her judgment now acquitted the offender, and &s;he &s;aw only the friend. The import of the&s;e words, who&s;e truth &s;he no longer doubted, again alarmed her. Why did he trouble him&s;elf to come from the chateau, on pur|po&s;e to hint her danger, if he did not wi&s;h to pre&s;erve her? And if he wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve her, what but nece&s;&s;ity could have withheld him from the appointment?</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="029379_0051_0FE08AE294DE3960">The&s;e reflections decided her at once. She re&s;olved to re|pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on the following day at the &s;ame hour to the rece&s;s&punc; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther the intere&s;t, which &s;he believed him to take in her fate would no doubt conduct him in the hope of meeting her. That &s;ome evil hovered over her &s;he could not di&s;believe, but what it might be, &s;he was unable to gue&s;s. Mon&s;ieur and Ma|dame La Motte were her friends, and who el&s;e, removed, as &s;he now thought her&s;elf, beyond the reach of her father, could in|jure her? But why did Theodore &s;ay &s;he was deceived? She found it impo&s;&s;ible to extricate her&s;elf from the labyrinth of conjecture, but endeavoured to command her anxiety till the following evening. In the mean time &s;he engaged her&s;elf in efforts to amu&s;e Madame La Motte, who required &s;ome relief, after the departure of her &s;on.</P>
<P>Thus oppre&s;&s;ed by her own cares and intere&s;ted by tho&s;e of Madame La Motte, Adeline retired to re&s;t. She &s;oon lo&s;t her recollection, but it was only to fall into hara&s;&s;ed &s;lumbers, &s;uch as but too often haunt the couch of the unhappy. At length her perturbed fancy &s;ugge&s;ted the following dream.</P>
<P>She thought &s;he was in a large old chamber belonging to the abbey, more ancient and de&s;olate, though in part furni&s;hed, than any &s;he had yet &s;een. It was &s;trongly barricadoed, yet no per|&s;on appeared. While &s;he &s;tood mu&s;ing and &s;urveying the apart|ment, &s;he heard a low voice call her, and looking towards the place from whence it came, &s;he perceived by the dim light of a lamp, a figure &s;tretched on a bed that lay on the floor. The voice called again, and approaching the bed, &s;he di&s;tinctly &s;aw the features of a man who appeared to be dying. A gha&s;tly palene&s;s over&s;pread his countenance, yet there was an expre&s;&s;ion of mildne&s;s and dignity in it, which &s;trongly intere&s;ted her.</P>
<P>While &s;he looked on him, his features changed and &s;eemed convul&s;ed in the agonies of death. The &s;pectacle &s;hocked h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;he &s;tarted back, but he &s;uddenly &s;tretched forth his ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;eizing her's, gra&s;ped it with violence: &s;he &s;truggled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> terror to di&s;engage her&s;elf, and again looking on his face, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a man, who appeared to be about thirty, with the &s;ame featur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but in full health, and of a mo&s;t benign countenance. He &s;mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tenderly upon her, and moved his lips, as if to &s;peak, when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> floor of the chamber &s;uddenly opened and he &s;unk from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> view. The effort &s;he made to &s;ave her&s;elf from following awoke her.

<PB N="101" REF="029379_0051_0FE08AE294DE3960">
apartment. At length, however, &s;he compo&s;ed her&s;elf to &s;leep; again &s;he fell into a dream.</P>
<P>She thought &s;he was bewildered in &s;ome winding pa&s;&s;ages of the abbey; that it was almo&s;t dark, and that &s;he wandered about a con&s;iderable time, without being able to find a door. Suddenly &s;he heard a bell toll from above, and &s;oon after a con|fu&s;ion of di&s;tant voices. She redoubled her efforts to extricate her&s;elf. Pre&s;ently all was &s;till, and, at length, wearied with the &s;earch, &s;he &s;at down on a &s;tep that cro&s;&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age. She had not been long here, when &s;he &s;aw a light glimmer at a di&s;tance on the walls, but a turn in the pa&s;&s;age, which was very long, prevented her &s;eeing from what it proceeded. It continued to glimmer faintly for &s;ome time, and then grew &s;tronger, when &s;he &s;aw a man enter the pa&s;&s;age, habited in a long black cloak, like tho&s;e u&s;ually worn by attendants at funerals, and bearing a torch. He called to her to follow him, and led her through a long pa&s;&s;age to the foot of a &s;tairca&s;e. Here &s;he feared to pro|ceed, and was running back, when the man &s;uddenly turned to pur&s;ue her, and with the terror, which this occa&s;ioned, &s;he awoke.</P>
<P>Shocked by tho&s;e vi&s;ions, and more &s;o by their &s;eeming con|nection, which now &s;truck her, &s;he endeavoured to continue awake, le&s;t their terrific images &s;hould again haunt her mind: after &s;ome time, however, her hara&s;&s;ed &s;pirits again &s;unk into &s;lum|ber though not to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>She now thought her&s;elf in a large old gallery, and &s;aw at one end of it a chamber door &s;tanding a little open, and a light within: &s;he went towards it, and perceived the man &s;he had before &s;een, &s;tanding at the door and beckoning her towards him. With the incon&s;i&s;tency &s;o common in dreams, &s;he no longer endeavoured to avoid him, but advancing, followed him into a &s;uite of very ancient apartments, hung with black, and lighted up as if for a funeral. Still he led her on, till &s;he found her&s;elf in the &s;ame chamber &s;he remembered to have &s;een in her former dream; a coffin, covered with a pall, &s;tood at the farther end of the room: &s;ome lights, and &s;everal per&s;ons &s;urrounded it, who appeared to be in great di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Suddenly &s;he thought the&s;e per&s;ons were all gone, and that &s;he was left alone; that &s;he went up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; and while &s;he gazed upon it, &s;he heard a voice &s;peak, as if from within, but &s;aw no body. The man &s;he had before &s;een, &s;oon after &s;tood by the coffin, and lifting the pall, &s;he &s;aw beneath it a dead per&s;on, whom &s;he thought to be the dying Chevalier &s;he had &s;een in her former dream: his features were &s;unk in death,
<PB N="102" REF="029379_0052_0FE08AE88C395560">
but they went yet &s;erene. While &s;he looked at him, a &s;tream of blood gu&s;hed from his &s;ide, and de&s;cending to the floor, the whole chamber was overflowed; at the &s;ame time &s;ome words were uttered in the voice &s;he heard before; but the horror of the &s;cene &s;o entirely overcome her, that &s;he &s;tarted and awoke.</P>
<P>When &s;he had recovered her recollection, &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf in the bed, to be convinced it was a dream &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, and the agitation of her &s;pirits was &s;o great, that &s;he feared to be alone, and almo&s;t determined to call Annette. The features of the decea&s;ed per&s;on, and the chamber where he lay, were &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon her memory, and &s;he &s;till thought &s;he heard the voice and &s;aw the countenance which her dream re|pre&s;ented. The longer &s;he con&s;idered the&s;e dreams, the more &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed: they were &s;o very terrible, returned &s;o often, and &s;eemed to be &s;o connected with each other, that &s;he could &s;carcely think them accidental; yet, why they &s;hould be &s;u|pernatural, &s;he could not tell. She &s;lept no more that night.</P>

of the abbey; and on going to the ca&s;ement, Adeline &s;aw the Marquis and his attendants on the lawn below. The portal of the abbey concealed &s;everal people from her view, and among the&s;e it was po&s;&s;ible might be Theodore, who had not yet ap|peared: &s;he continued to look for him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> great anxiety, till the Marquis entered the hall with La Motte, and &s;ome other per&s;ons, &s;oon after which Madame went to receive him, and Adeline retired to her own appartment.</P>
<P>A me&s;&s;age from La Motte, however, &s;oon called her to join the party, where &s;he vainly hoped to find Theodore. The Marquis aro&s;e as &s;he approached, and, having paid her &s;ome general compliments, the conver&s;ation took a very lively turn. Adeline, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to counterfeit cheerfulne&s;s, while her heart was &s;inking with anxiety and di&s;appointment, took little part in it: Theodore was not once named. She would have a&s;ked concerning him, had it been po&s;&s;ible to inquire with propriety; but &s;he was obliged to content her&s;elf with hoping, fir&s;t, that he would arrive before dinner, and then be|fore the the departure of the Marquis.</P>
<P>Thus, the day pa&s;&s;ed in expectation and di&s;appointment. The evening was now approaching, and &s;he was condemned to re|main in the pre&s;ence of the Marquis, apparently li&s;tening to a conver&s;ation, which, in truth &s;he &s;carcely heard, while the op|portunity was, perhaps, e&s;caping that would decide her fate. She was &s;uddenly relieved from this &s;tate of torture, and thrown into one, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Marquis inquired for Louis, and being informed of his departure, mentioned that Theodore Peyrou had that morning &s;at out for his regiment in a di&s;tant province. He lamented the lo&s;s he &s;hould &s;u&s;tain by his ab&s;ence; and expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome very flattering prai&s;e of his, talents. The &s;hock of this intelligence overpowered the long agitated &s;pirits of Adeline; the blood for&s;ook her cheeks, and a &s;udden faintne&s;s came over her, from which &s;he recovered only to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having di&s;cov|ered her emotion, and the danger of relap&s;ing into a &s;econd fit.</P>
<P>She retired to her chamber, where, being once more alone, her oppre&s;&s;ed heart found relief from tears, in which &s;he freely indulged. Ideas crowded &s;o fa&s;t upon her mind, that it was long ere &s;he could arrange them &s;o as to produce any thing like rea&s;oning. She endeavoured to account for the abrupt de|parture of Theodore.</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible" &s;aid &s;he, "that he &s;hould take an intere&s;t in my welfare, and yet leave me expo&s;ed to the full force of a dan|ger,

No!&mdash; whatever is re&s;erved for me, let me not relinqui&s;h the plea&s;ure of believing that he is worthy of my e&s;teem."</P>
<P>She was awakened from thoughts like the&s;e by a peal of di&s;|tant thunder, and now perceived that the gloomine&s;s of even|ing was deepened by the coming &s;torm; it rolled onward, and &s;oon after the lightning began to fla&s;h along the chamber. Adeline was &s;uperior to the affectation of fear, and was not apt to be terrified; but &s;he now felt it unplea&s;ant to be alone, and, hoping that the Marquis might have left the abbey, &s;he went down to the &s;itting room; out the threatening a&s;pect of the Heavens had hitherto detained him, and now the evening tem|pe&s;t made him rejoice that he had not quitted a &s;helter. The &s;torm continued and night came on. La Motte pre&s;&s;ed his gue&s;t to take a bed at the abbey, and he at length con&s;ented; a circum&s;tance which threw Madame La Motte into &s;ome per|plexity, as to the accommodation to be afforded him; after &s;ome|time, &s;he arranged the affair to her &s;atisfaction; re&s;igning her own apartment to the Marquis, and that of Louis to two of his &s;uperior attendants; Adeline, it was farther &s;ettled, &s;hould give up her room to Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte, and remove to an inner chamber, where a &s;mall bed, u&s;ually occupied by Annette, was placed for her.</P>
<P>At &s;upper the Marquis was le&s;s gay than u&s;ual; he frequently addre&s;&s;ed Adeline, and his look and manner &s;eemed to expre&s;s the tendere&s;t intere&s;t, which her indi&s;po&s;ition, for &s;he &s;till appeared pale and languid, had excited. Adeline, as u&s;ual, made an effort to forget her anxiety, and appear happy; but the veil of a&s;&s;umed cheerfulne&s;s was too thin to conceal the features of &s;orrow; and her feeble &s;miles only added a peculiar &s;oftne&s;s to her air. The Marquis conver&s;ed with her on a variety of &s;ubjects, and di&s;|played an elegant mind. The ob&s;ervations of Adeline, which, when called upon, &s;he gave with reluctant mode&s;ty, in words at once &s;imple and forceful, &s;eemed to exci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e his admiration, which he &s;ometimes betrayed by an inadvertent expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Adeline retired early to her room, which adjoined on one &s;ide to Madame La Motte's, and on the other to the clo&s;et for|merly mentioned. It was &s;pacious and lofty, and what little furniture it contained was falling to decay; but, perhaps, the
<PB N="105" REF="029379_0053_0FE08AFB56E2D360">
pre&s;ent tone of her &s;pirits might contribute more than the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances to give that air of melancholy, which &s;eemed to reign in it. She was unwilling to go to bed, left the dreams that had lately pur&s;ued her &s;hould return; and determined to &s;it up till &s;he found her&s;elf oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;leep, when it was prob|able her re&s;t would be profound. She placed the light on a &s;mall table, and taking a book, continued to read for above an hour, till her mind refu&s;ed any longer to ab&s;tract it&s;elf from its own cares, and &s;he &s;at for &s;ometime leaning pen&s;ively on her arm.</P>
<P>The wind was high, and as it whi&s;tled through the de&s;olate apartment, and &s;hook the feeble doors, &s;he often &s;tarted, and &s;ometimes even thought &s;he heard &s;ighs between the pau&s;es of the gu&s;t; but &s;he checked the&s;e illu&s;ions, which the hour of the night and her own melancholy imagination con&s;pired to rai&s;e. As &s;he &s;at mu&s;ing, her eyes fixed on the oppo&s;ite wall, &s;he per|ceived the arras, with which the room hung, wave backward and forwards; &s;he continued to ob&s;erve it for &s;ome minutes, and then ro&s;e to examine it farther. It was moved by the wind; and &s;he blu&s;hed at the momentary fear it had excited: but &s;he ob&s;erved that the tape&s;try was more &s;trongly agitated in one par|ticular place than el&s;ewhere, and a noi&s;e that &s;eemed &s;omething more than that of the wind i&s;&s;ued thence. The old bed&s;tead which La Motte had found in this apartment, had been removed to accommodate Adeline, and it was behind the place where this had &s;tood, that the wind &s;eemed to ru&s;h with particular force; curio&s;ity prompted her to examine &s;till farther; &s;he felt about the tape&s;try, and perceiving the wall behind &s;hake under her hand, &s;he lifted the arras, and di&s;covered a &s;mall door, who&s;e loo&s;ened hinges admitted the wind, and occa&s;ioned the noi&s;e &s;he had heard.</P>
<P>The door was held only by a bolt, having undrawn which, and brought the light, &s;he de&s;cended by a few &s;teps into ano|ther chamber: &s;he in&s;tantly remembered her dreams. The chamber was not much like that in which &s;he had &s;een the dy|ing Chevalier and afterwards the bier; but it gave her a con|fu&s;ed remembrance of one through which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed. Hold|ing up the light to examine it more fully, &s;he was convinced by its &s;tructure that it was part of the ancient foundation. A &s;hattered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ement, placed high from the floor, &s;eemed to be the only opening to admit light. She ob&s;erved a door on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the apartment; and after &s;ome moments of he&s;i|tation, gained courage and determined to pur&s;ue the inquiry. "A my&s;tery &s;eems to hang over the&s;e chambers," &s;aid &s;he,
<PB N="106" REF="029379_0054_0FE08B002C187F78">
"which it is, perhaps, my lot to devolope; I will, at lea&s;t, &s;ee to what that door leads."</P>
<P>She &s;tepped forward, and having unclo&s;ed it, proceeded with faltering &s;teps along a &s;uite of apartments, re&s;embling the fir&s;t in &s;tyle and condition, and terminating in one exactly that where her dream had repre&s;ented the dying per&s;on; the remem|brance &s;truck &s;o forcibly upon her imagination, that &s;he was in danger of fainting; and looking round the room, almo&s;t ex|pected to &s;ee the phantom of her dream.</P>
<P>Unable to quit the place, &s;he &s;at down on &s;ome old lumber to recover her&s;elf, while her &s;pirits were nearly overcome by a &s;uper&s;titious dread, &s;uch as &s;he had never felt before. She wondered to what part of the abbey the&s;e chambers belonged, and that they had &s;o long e&s;caped detection. The ca&s;ements were all too high to afford any information from without. When &s;he was &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to con&s;ider the direction of the rooms, and the &s;ituation of the abbey, there appeared not a doubt that they formed an interior part of the original building.</P>
<P>As the&s;e reflections pa&s;&s;ed over her mind, a &s;udden gleam of moonlight fell upon &s;ome object without the ca&s;ement. Being now &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to wi&s;h to pur&s;ue the inquiry; and believing this object might afford her &s;ome means of learn|ing the &s;ituation of the&s;e rooms, &s;he combated her remaining terrors, and in order to di&s;tingui&s;h it more clearly, removed the light to an outer chamber; but before &s;he could return, a heavy cloud was driven over the face of the moon, and all without was perfectly dark: &s;he &s;tood for &s;ome moments wait|ing a returning gleam, but the ob&s;curity continued. As &s;he went &s;oftly back for the light, her foot &s;tumbled over &s;ome|thing on the floor, and while &s;he &s;topped to examine it, the moon again &s;hone, &s;o that &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h through the ca&s;ement, the ea&s;tern towers of the abbey. This di&s;covery confirmed her former conjectures concerning the interior &s;itua|tion of the&s;e apartments. The ob&s;curity of the place prevented her di&s;covering what it was that had impeded her &s;teps, but having brought the light forward, &s;he perceived on the floor an old dagger: with a trembling hand &s;he took it up, and upon a clo&s;er view perceived, that it was &s;potted and &s;tained with ru&s;t.</P>
<P>Shocked and &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;he looked round the room for &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> object that might confirm or de&s;troy the dreadful &s;u&s;picio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which now ru&s;hed upon her mind; but &s;he &s;aw only a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

chair, with broken arms, that &s;tood in one corner of the room, and a table in a condition equally &s;hattered, except that in another part lay a confu&s;ed heap of things, which appeared to be old lumber. She went up to it, and perceived a broken bed&s;tead, with &s;ome decayed remnants of furniture covered with du&s;t and cobwebs, and which &s;eemed, indeed as if they had not been moved for many years. De&s;irous, however, of examining farther, &s;he attempted to rai&s;e what appeared to have been part of the bed&s;tead, but it &s;lipped from her hand, and, rooling to the floor, brought with it &s;ome of the remaining lumber. Ade|line &s;tarted a&s;ide and &s;aved her&s;elf, and when the noi&s;e it made had cea&s;ed, &s;he heard a &s;mall ru&s;tling &s;ound, and as &s;he was about to leave the chamber, &s;aw &s;omething falling gently among the lumber.</P>
<P>It was a &s;mall roll of paper, tied with a &s;tring and covered with du&s;t. Adeline took it up, and on opening it perceived a hand writing. She attemped to read it but the part of the manu&s;cript &s;he looked at was &s;o much obliterated, that &s;he found this difficult, though what few words were legible im|pre&s;&s;ed her with curio&s;ity and terror, and induced her to return with it immediately to her chamber.</P>
<P>Having reached her own room, &s;he fa&s;tened the private door, and let the arras fall over it as before. It was now midnight. The &s;tillne&s;s of the hour, interrupted only at intervals by the hollow &s;ighings of the bla&s;t, heightened the &s;olemnity of Ade|line's feelings. She wi&s;hed &s;he was not alone, and before &s;he proceeded to look into the manu&s;cript, li&s;tened whether Ma|dame La Motte was yet in her chamber: not the lea&s;t &s;ound was heard, and &s;he gently opened the door. The profound &s;ilence within almo&s;t convinced her that no per&s;on was there; but willing to be farther &s;atisfied &s;he brought the light and found the room empty. The latene&s;s of the hour made her wonder that Madame La Motte was not in her chamber, and &s;he pro|ceeded to the top of the tower &s;tairs, to hearken if any per&s;on was &s;tirring.</P>
<P>She heard the &s;ound of voices from below, and among&s;t the re&s;t that of La Motte &s;peaking in his u&s;ual tone. Being now &s;atisfied that all was well, &s;he turned towards her room, when &s;he heard the Marquis pronounce her name with very unu&s;ual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpha&s;is. She pau&s;ed "I adore her," pur&s;ued he, "and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eaven"&mdash;He was interrupted by La Motte, "My lord re|member your promi&s;e."</P>
<P>"I do," replied the Marquis, "and I will abide by it. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e trifle. To morrow I will declare my&s;elf, and I &s;hall then

know both what to hope and how to act." Adeline trembled &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that &s;he could &s;carcely &s;upport her&s;elf: &s;he wi&s;hed to return to her chamber; yet &s;he was too much intere&s;ted in the words &s;he had heard, not to be anxious to have them more fully explained. There was an interval of &s;ilence, after which they conver&s;ed in a lower tone. Adeline rememberd the hints of Theodore, and determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to be relieved from the terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;he now &s;uffered. She &s;tole &s;oftly down a few &s;teps, that &s;he might catch the accents of the &s;peakers, but they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere &s;o low that &s;he could only now and then di&s;tin|gui&s;h a few words. "Her father, &s;ay you?" &s;aid the Marquis, "Yes, my Lord, her father. I am well informed of what I &s;ay." Adeline &s;huddered at the mention of her father, a new terror &s;eized her, and with increa&s;ing eagerne&s;s &s;he endeavour|ed to di&s;tingui&s;h their words, but for &s;ome time found this to be impo&s;&s;ible. "Here is no time to be lo&s;t," &s;aid the Marquis&punc; "to morrow then."&mdash;She heard La Motte ri&s;e, and, believing it was to leave the room, &s;he hurried up the &s;teps, and having reached her chamber, &s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s in a chair.</P>
<P>It was her father only of whom &s;he thought. She doubted not that he had pur&s;ued and di&s;covered her retreat, and though this conduct appeared very incon&s;i&s;tent with his former beha|viour in abandoning her to &s;trangers, her fears &s;ugge&s;ted that it would terminate in &s;ome new cruelty. She did not he&s;itate to pronounce this the danger of which Theodore had warned her; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;urmi&s;e how he had gained his know|ledge of it, or how he had become &s;ufficiently acquainted with her &s;tory, except through La Motte, her apparent friend and protector, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;he was thus, though unwillingly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;u&s;|pect of treachery. Why indeed, &s;hould La Motte conceal from her only his knowledge of her father's intention, unle&s;s he de&s;ign|ed to deliver her into his hands? Yet it was long ere &s;he could bring her&s;elf to believe this conclu&s;ion po&s;&s;ible. To di&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> depravity in tho&s;e whom we have loved, is one of the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite tortures to a virtuous mind, and the conviction is often rejected before it is finally admitted.</P>
<P>The words of Theodore, which told her he was fearful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was deceived, confirmed this mo&s;t painful apprehen&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Motte, with another yet more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, that Madame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Motte was al&s;o united again&s;t her. This thought, for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment, &s;ubdued terror, and left her only grief; &s;he wept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly. "Is this human nature?" cried &s;he. "Am I doo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> find every body deceitful?"

<P>Adeline determined to throw her&s;elf at the feet of La Mot|te on the following morning, and implore his pity and pro|tection. Her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd was now too much agitated by her own intere&s;ts, to permit her to examine the manu&s;cripts, and &s;he &s;at mu&s;ing in her chair, till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he heard the &s;teps of Madame La Motte, when &s;he retired to bed. La Motte &s;oon after came up to his chamber, and Adeline the mild, per&s;ecuted Adeline&punc; who had now pa&s;&s;ed two days of torturing anxiety, and one night of terrific vi&s;ions, endeavoured to compo&s;e her mind to &s;leep.

<P>At length &s;he retired to her bed, and her &s;lumbers were this night undi&s;turbed by dreams.</P>
<P>When &s;he aro&s;e in the morning, &s;he ob&s;erved La Motte walking alone in the avenue below, and &s;he ha&s;tened to &s;eize the opportunity which now offered of pleading her cau&s;e. She approached him with faltering &s;teps, while the palene&s;s&punc; and timidity, of her countenance di&s;covered the di&s;order of her mind. Her fir&s;t words, without entering upon any explanation&punc; implored his compa&s;&s;ion. La Motte &s;topped, and, looking earne&s;tly in her face, inquired whether any part of his conduct towards her merited the &s;u&s;picion which her reque&s;t impli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Adeline for a moment blu&s;hed that &s;he had doubted his integ|rity, but the words &s;he had overheard returned to her memory.</P>
<P>"Your behaviour&punc; Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "I acknowledge to have been kind and generous, beyond what I had a right to expect, but"&mdash;and &s;he pau&s;ed. She knew not how to mention what &s;he blu&s;hed to believe. La Motte continued to gave on her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ilent expectation, and at length de&s;ired her to proceed and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+plain her meaning. She entreated that he would protect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from her father. La Motte looked &s;urpri&s;ed and confu&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; "Your father!" &s;aid he. "Yes Sir," replied Adeline; "I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not ignorant that he has di&s;covered my retreat.

<P>La Motte &s;tood fixed in thought, and Adeline continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> endeavours to intere&s;t his pity. "What rea&s;on have your &s;uppo&s;e, or, rather, how have you learned, that your father p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;ues you?"

to invent or utter a fal&s;ity: at length &s;he confe&s;&s;ed the truth. The countenance of La Motte in&s;tantly changed to a &s;avage fiercene&s;s, and &s;harply rebuking her for a conduct, to which &s;he had been rather tempted by chance, than prompted by de|&s;ign, he inquired what &s;he had overheard, that could &s;o much alarm her. She faithfully repeated the &s;ub&s;tance of the incohe|rent &s;entences that had met her ear; while &s;he &s;poke, he re|garded her with a fixed attention. "And was this all you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">? Is it from the&s;e few words that you draw &s;uch a po&s;i|tive conclu&s;ion?

<P>She now perceived, what the fervor of her fears had not per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to ob&s;erve before, that the words, unconnectedly as &s;he heard them, imported little, and that her imagination had filled up the void in the &s;entences, &s;o as to &s;ugge&s;t the evil apprehended.

It is true, that from a motive of compa&s;&s;ion I have refu&s;ed to re&s;ign you, but I have neither authority to withhold, or means to defend you. When he comes to enforce his demand, you will perceive this. Prepare your&s;elf, therefore, for the evil whicn you &s;ee is inevitable."</P>
<P>Adeline for &s;ome time, could &s;peak only by her tears. At length, with a fortitude which de&s;pair had rou&s;ed, &s;he &s;aid, "I re&s;ign my&s;elf to the will of heaven!" La Motte gazed on her in &s;ilence, and a &s;trong emotion appeared in his countenance. He forbore, however, to renew the di&s;cour&s;e, and withdrew to the abbey, leaving Adeline in the avenue, ab&s;orbed in grief.</P>
<P>A &s;ummons to breakfa&s;t ha&s;tened her to the parlour, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the morning in conver&s;ation with Madame La Motte, to whom &s;he told all her apprehen&s;ions, and expre&s;&s;ed all her &s;orrow. Pity and &s;uperficial con&s;olation was all that Madame La Motte could offer, though apparently much affected by Ade|line's di&s;cour&s;e. Thus the hours pa&s;&s;ed heavily away while the anxiety of Adeline continued to increa&s;e, and the moment of her fate &s;eemed fa&s;t approaching. Dinner was &s;carcely over when Adeline was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the Marquis arrive. He en|tered the room with his u&s;ual ea&s;e, and apologizing for the di&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e he had occa&s;ioned on the preceding night, repeated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he had before told La Motte.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="029379_0057_0FE08B28F8629200">The remembrance of the conver&s;ation &s;he had overheard, at fir&s;t gave Adeline &s;ome confu&s;ion, and withdrew her mind from a &s;en&s;e of the evils to be apprehended from her father. The Marquis who, was, as u&s;ual, attentive to Adeline, &s;eemed af|fected by her apparent indi&s;po&s;ition, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;&s;ed much con|cern for that dejection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f &s;pirits, which, notwith&s;tanding every effort, her manner betrayed.

<P>Adeline knew too well what would be the purport of the Marquis's di&s;cour&s;e, and his words &s;oon increa&s;ed the confu&s;ion which her fears had occa&s;ioned. While he was declaring the ardour of his pa&s;&s;ion in &s;uch terms, as but too often make ve|hemence p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for &s;incerity, Adeline, to whom this declaration, if honourable, was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and if di&s;honourable, was &s;hock|ing, interrupted him and thanked him for the offer of a di&s;tinc|tion, which, with a mode&s;t but determined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;he &s;aid &s;he mu&s;t refu&s;e.

<P>Adeline continued to move towards the door, when the Marquis threw him&s;elf at her feet, and &s;eizing her hand, im|pre&s;&s;ed it with ki&s;&s;es. She &s;truggled to di&s;engage her&s;elf. "Hear me, charming Adeline! hear me," cried the Marquis&punc; "I exi&s;t but for you.

<P>She again attempted to go, but the Marquis prevented h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and after &s;ome he&s;itation, again urged his &s;uit, though in ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that would no longer allow her to mi&s;under&s;tand him.

&s;welled into her eyes, but &s;he endeavoured to check them, and with a look, in which grief and indignation &s;eemed to &s;truggle for pre-eminence, &s;he &s;aid, "My Lord, this is unworthy of re|ply, let me pa&s;s&punc;</P>
<P>For a moment, he was awed by the dignity of her manner, and he threw him&s;elf at her feet to implore forgivene&s;s. But &s;he waved her hand in &s;ilence and hurried from the room. When &s;he reached her chamber, &s;he locked the door, and &s;ink|ing into a chair, yielded to the &s;orrow, that pre&s;&s;ed at her heart. And it was not the lea&s;t of her &s;orrow, to &s;u&s;pect that La Motte was unworthy of her confidence; for it was al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that he could be ignorant of the real de&s;igns of the Marquis. Madame La Motte, &s;he believed was impo&s;ed upon by a &s;pecious pretence of honourable attachment; and thus was &s;he &s;pared the pang, which a doubt of her integrity would have added.</P>
<P>She threw a trembling glance upon the pro&s;pect around her. On one &s;ide was her father, who&s;e cruelty had already been too plainly manife&s;ted; and on the other, the Marquis pur&s;uing her with in&s;ult, and vicious pa&s;&s;ion. She re&s;olved to acquaint Ma|dame La Motte with the purport of the late conver&s;ation, and, in the hope of her protection and &s;ympathy, &s;he wiped away her tears, and was leaving the room ju&s;t as Madame La Motte entered it. While Adeline related what had pa&s;&s;ed, her friend wept, and appeared to &s;uffer great agitation. She endeavoured to comfort her, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e her influence in per&s;uading La Motte to prohibit the addre&s;&s;es of the Marquis. "You know, my dear," added Madame, "that our pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances oblige us to pre&s;erve terms with the Marquis, and you will, therefore, &s;uffer as little re&s;entment to appear in your man|ner towards him as po&s;&s;ible; conduct your&s;elf with your u&s;ual ca&s;e in his pre&s;ence, and I doubt not this affair will pa&s;s over, without &s;ubjecting you to farther &s;olicitation."</P>
<P>"Ah Madame!" &s;aid Adeline, "how hard is this ta&s;k you a&s;&s;ign me! I entreat you that I may never more be &s;ubjected to the humiliation of being in his pre&s;ence, that, whenever he a&s;&s;its the abbey, I may be &s;uffered to remain in my chamber."</P>
<P>"This, &s;aid Madame La Motte, "I would mo&s;t readily con&s;ent to, would our &s;ituation permit it. But you well know our a&s;ylum in this abbey depends upon the good will of the Marquis, which we mu&s;t not wantonly lo&s;e; and &s;urely &s;uch a conduct as you propo&s;e would endanger this. Let us u&s;e milder mea&s;ures and we &s;hall pre&s;erve his friend&s;hip, without &s;ubjecting

<P>Adeline &s;ighed. I obey you Madame," &s;aid &s;he; "it is my duty to do &s;o; but I may be pardoned for &s;aying, it is with ex|treme reluctance. Madame La Motte promi&s;ed to go imme|diately to her hu&s;band, and Adeline departed, though not con|vinced of her &s;afety, yet &s;omewhat more at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>She &s;oon after &s;aw the Marquis depart, and, as there now ap|peared to be no ob&s;tacle to the return of Madame La Motte, &s;he expected her with extreme impatience. After thus waiting near an hour in her chamber, &s;he was at length &s;ummoned to the parlour, and there found Mon&s;ieur La Motte alone. He aro&s;e upon her entrance, and for &s;ome minutes paced the room in &s;ilence. He then &s;eated him&s;elf, and addre&s;&s;ed her: "What you have mentioned to Madame La Motte," &s;aid he, "would give me much concern, did I con&s;ider the behaviour of the Marquis in a light &s;o &s;erious as &s;he does. I know that young ladies are apt to mi&s;con&s;true the unmeaning gallantry of fa&s;h|ionable manners, and you, Adeline, can never be too cautious in di&s;tingui&s;hing between a levity of this kind, and a more &s;e|rious adddre&s;s."</P>
<P>Adeline was &s;urpri&s;ed and offended that La Motte &s;hould think &s;o lightly both of her under&s;tanding and di&s;po&s;ition as his &s;peech impl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. "It is impo&s;&s;ible, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "that you have been apprized of the Marquis's conduct?"</P>
<P>"It is very po&s;&s;ible, and very certain," replied La Motte, with &s;ome a&s;perity; "and very po&s;&s;ible, al&s;o, that I may &s;ee this affair with a judgment le&s;s di&s;coloured by prejudice than you do. But, however, I &s;hall not di&s;pute this point. I &s;hall only reque&s;t, that, &s;ince you are acquainted with the emergency of my circum&s;tances, you will conform to them, and not, by an ill timed re&s;entment, expo&s;e me to the enmity of the Marquis. He is now my friend, and it is nece&s;&s;ary to my &s;afety that he &s;hould continue &s;uch; but if I &s;uffer any part of my family to treat him with rudene&s;s I mu&s;t expect to &s;ee him my enemy. You may &s;urely treat him with complai&s;ance." Adeline thought the term <HI>rudene&s;s</HI> a har&s;h one, as La Motte applied it, but &s;he forebore from any expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;plea&s;ure. "I could have wi&s;hed&punc; Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "for the privilege of retiring whenever the Marquis appeared; but &s;ince you believe this conduct would affect your intere&s;t, I ought to &s;ubmit."</P>
<P>"This prudence and good will delight me," &s;aid La Motte, "and &s;ince you wi&s;h to &s;erve me, know that you cannot more

effectually do it, than by treating the Marquis as a friend." The word <HI>friend,</HI> as it &s;tood connected with the Marquis, &s;ounded di&s;&s;onantly to Adeline's ear; &s;he he&s;itated and looked at La Motte. "As <HI>your</HI> friend, Sir," &s;aid &s;he; "I will endeavour to"&mdash;treat him as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, &s;he would have &s;aid, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> found it impo&s;&s;ible to fini&s;h the &s;entence.

<P>"What protection I can afford is your's," &s;aid La Motte, "but you know how de&s;titute I am both of the right and the means of re&s;i&s;ting him, and al&s;o how much I require protection my&s;elf.

<P>"Your plan is rea&s;onable," &s;aid La Motte, "had I money to execute it.

<P>Adeline was &s;o much affected by this in&s;tance of La Motte's kindne&s;s, which &s;he could not doubt, that &s;he was unable to ex|pre&s;s her &s;en&s;e of it. When &s;he could &s;peak, &s;he uttered her gratitude in the mo&s;t lively terms. "Are you &s;incere in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions?" &s;aid La Motte.</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible I can be le&s;s than &s;incere?" replied Adeline, weeping at the idea of ingratitude. "Sentiments are ea&s;ily pronounced," &s;aid La Motte, "though they may have no con|nection with the heart; I believe them to be &s;incere &s;o far only as they influence our actions."</P>

<P>Adeline blu&s;hed and fixed her eyes on the ground. "You have, indeed, Sir, named the only meant I &s;hould reject of evincing my &s;incerity. The Marquis I can never love, nor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;peak &s;incerely, ever e&s;teem.

<P>This unju&s;t &s;arca&s;m brought tears to her eyes. "Since your &s;afety, Sir, depends upon my conduct," &s;aid &s;he, "re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me to my father.

<P>THE MS. found by Adeline, the preceding night, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">veral times occurred to her recollection in the cour&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, but &s;he had then been either too much intere&s;ted by the events of the moment, of too apprehen&s;ive of interruption, to attempt a peru&s;al of it.

<P>She opened it with an eagerne&s;s of inquiry, which the di&s;col|oured and almo&s;t obliterated ink but &s;lowly gratified. The fir&s;t words on the page were entirely lo&s;t, but tho&s;e that ap|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ared to commence the narrative were as follows:</P>
<P>"O! ye, whoever ye are, whom chance, or misfortune, may hereafter conduct to this &s;pot&mdash;to y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I &s;peak&mdash;to ye reveal the &s;tory of my wrongs, and a&s;k ye to avenge them.

<P>Adeline's light was now expiring in the &s;ocket, and the pale|ne&s;s of the ink &s;o feebly &s;hone upon, baffled her efforts to di&s;|criminate the letters: it was impo&s;&s;ible to procure a light from below, without di&s;covering that &s;he was yet up; a circum&s;tance which would excite &s;urpri&s;e and lead to explanations, &s;uch as &s;he did not wi&s;h to enter upon. Thus compelled to &s;u&s;pend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> inquiry, which &s;o many attendant circum&s;tances had rendered awfully intere&s;ting, &s;he retired to her humble bed.</P>
<P>What &s;he had read of the MS. awakened a dreadful intere&s;t in the fate of the writer, and called up terrific images to her mind. "In the&s;e apartments?" &s;aid &s;he, and &s;he &s;huddered and clo&s;ed her eyes. At length, &s;he heard Madame La Motte enter her chamber, and the phamtoms of fear beginning to di&s;&s;ipate, left her to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the morning, &s;he was awakened by Madame La Motte and found, to her di&s;appointment, that &s;he had &s;lept &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> beyond her u&s;ual time, as to be unable to renew the peru&s;al of the MS. La Motte appeared uncommonly gloomy, and Mada<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wore an air of melancholy, which Adeline attributed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> concern &s;he felt for her.

told him, "&s;he would not hear any conver&s;ation, except in the pre&s;ence of her friends." But &s;he &s;aid it in vain, for they were gone; and La Motte, as he withdrew, expre&s;&s;ed by his looks how much an attempt to follow would di&s;plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>She &s;at for &s;ome time in &s;ilence, and trembling expectation. "I am &s;en&s;ible," &s;aid the Marquis, at length, "that the conduct to which the ardour of my pa&s;&s;ion lately betrayed me, has in|jured me in your opinion, and that you will not ea&s;ily re&s;tore me to your e&s;teem; but, I tru&s;t, the offer which I now make you, both of my <HI>title</HI> and fortune, will &s;ufficiently prove the &s;incerity of my attachment, and atone for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion which love only prompted."</P>
<P>After this &s;pecimen of common place verbo&s;ity, which the Marquis &s;eemed to con&s;ider as a prelude to triumph, he attempt|ed to impre&s;s a ki&s;s upon the hand of Adeline, who withdrawing it ha&s;tily, &s;aid, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are already, my Lord, acquainted with my &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject, and it is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary for me now to repeat, that I cannot accept the honour you offer me."</P>
<P>"Explain your&s;elf, lovely Adeline! I am ignorant that till now, I ever made you this offer."</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t true Sir," &s;aid Adeline, "and you do well to remind me of this, &s;ince, after having heard your former propo&s;al, I can li&s;ten for a moment to any other." She ro&s;e to quit the room. "Stay, Madam," &s;aid the Marquis, with a look, in which of|fended pride &s;truggled to conceal it&s;elf, "do not &s;uffer an ex|travagant re&s;entment to operate again&s;t your true intere&s;ting recollect the dangers that &s;urround you, and con&s;ider the value of an offer, which may afford you at lea&s;t an honourable a&s;ylum."</P>
<P>"My misfortunes, my Lord, whatever they are, I have never ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">truded upon you; you will, therefore, excu&s;e my ob&s;erving, that your pre&s;ent mention of them conveys a much greater ap|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance of in&s;ult than compa&s;&s;ion." The Marquis, though with ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent confu&s;ion, was going to reply; but Adeline would not be detained, and retired to her chamber. De&s;titute as &s;he was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> heart revolted from the propo&s;al of the Marquis, and &s;he de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ermined never to accept it. To her di&s;like of his general di&s;po&s;ition, and the aver&s;ion excited by his late offer, was added, indeed, the influence of a prior attachment, and of a remem|brance, which &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to era&s;e from her heart.</P>
<P>The Marquis &s;tayed to dine, and in con&s;ideration of La Motte, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine appeared at table, where the former gazed upon her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch frequent and &s;ilent earne&s;tne&s;s, that her di&s;tre&s;s became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ortable, and when the cloth was drawn, &s;he in&s;tantly

retired. Madame La Motte &s;oon followed, and it was not till evening that &s;he had an opportunity of returning to the MS When Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte were in their chamber, and all was &s;till, &s;he drew forth the narrative, and trimming her lamp, &s;at down to read as follows:</P>
<P>"The ruffians unbound me from my hor&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d me through the hall up the &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e of the abbey: re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce was u&s;ele&s;s, but I looked around <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the hope of &s;eeing &s;ome per&s;on le&s;s obdurate than the men who brought me hither; &s;ome one who might be &s;en&s;ible to pity, and capable, at lea&s;t, of civil treat|ment. I looked in vain; no per&s;on a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">peared: and this circum|&s;tance confirmed my wor&s;t apprehen&s;ions. The &s;ecrecy of the bu&s;ine&s;s foretold a horri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> conclu&s;ion. Having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome chambers, they &s;topped in one hung with old tape&s;try.

<P>"At that moment, I expected to &s;ee th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;trument of death uplifted, and &s;ilently recommended my&s;elf to God, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was not then de&s;igned for me; they drew a&s;ide the arras, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;covered a door, which they then opened.

Having reached the farther of the&s;e, they again &s;topped: the horrid gloom of the place &s;eemed congenial to murder, and in&s;pired deadly thoughts. Again I looked round for the in&s;trume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;truction, and again I was re&s;pited. I &s;upplicated to know what was de&s;igned me; it was now unnece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k who was the author of the de&s;ign.

Alas! he knows full well, that from this indulgence he has nothing to fear. My pen can call no friends to &s;uccour me, nor reveal my danger ere it is too late. O! ye, who may hereafter read what I now write, give a tear to my &s;ufferings: I have wept often for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my fellow creatures!"</P>
<P>Adeline pau&s;ed. Here the wretched writer appealed di|rectly to her heart; he &s;poke in the energy of truth, and, by a &s;trong illu&s;ion of fancy, it &s;eemed as if his pa&s;t &s;ufferings were at this moment pre&s;ent. She was for &s;ome time unable to pro|ceed, and &s;at in mu&s;ing &s;orrow. "In the&s;e very apartments," &s;aid &s;he, "this poor &s;ufferer was confined&mdash;here he"&mdash;Adeline &s;tarted, and thought &s;he heard a &s;ound; but the &s;tillne&s;s of night was undi&s;turbed.&mdash;"In the&s;e very chambers." &s;aid &s;he, "the&s;e lines were written&mdash;the&s;e lines from which he then derived a comfort in believing they would hereafter be read by &s;ome pity|ing eye: this time is now come. Your mi&s;eries, O injured being! are lamented, where they were endured. <HI>Here,</HI> where you &s;uffered, I weep for your &s;ufferings!"</P>
<P>Her imagination was now &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed, and to her di&s;|tempered &s;en&s;es the &s;ugge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions of a bewildered mind appeared with the force of reality. Again &s;he &s;tarted and li&s;tened, and thought &s;he heard "<HI>Here</HI>" di&s;tinctly repeated by a whi&s;per im|mediately behind her. The terror of the thought, however, was but momentary, &s;he knew it could not be; convinced that her fancy had deceived her, &s;he took up the MS. and again began to read.</P>

<P>"O dire extremity! O &s;tate of living death! What dreadful &s;tillne&s;s! All around me is dead; and do I really exi&s;t, or am I but a &s;tatue? Is this a vi&s;ion? Are the&s;e things real?

<P>Adeline pau&s;ed, while her tears fell fa&s;t. "Unhappy man&punc; &s;he exclaimed, "and was there no pitying &s;oul to &s;ave thee! Great God! thy ways are wonderful!" While &s;he &s;at mu&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her fancy, which now wandered in the regions of terror, gradu|ally &s;ubdued rea&s;on. There was a gla&s;s before her upon the table, and &s;he feared to rai&s;e her looks towards it, le&s;t &s;ome other face than her own &s;hould meet her eyes: other dreadful ideas, and &s;trange images of fanta&s;tic thought now cro&s;&s;ed her mind.</P>
<P>A hollow &s;igh &s;eemed to pa&s;s near her. "Holy Virgin, pro|tect me!" cried &s;he, and threw a fearful glance round the room; "this is &s;urely &s;omething more than fancy." Her fears &s;o far overcame her, that &s;he was &s;everal times upon the point of call|ing up part of the family, but unwillingne&s;s to di&s;turb them, and a dread of ridicule, withheld her. She was al&s;o afraid to move and almo&s;t to breathe. As &s;he li&s;tened to the wind, that murmured at the ca&s;ements of her lonely chamber, &s;he again thought &s;he heard a &s;igh. Her imagination refu&s;ed any long<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the controul of rea&s;on, and turning her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yes, a figure, who&s;e

exact form &s;he could not di&s;tingui&s;h, appeared to pa&s;s along an ob&s;cure part of the chamber; a dreadful chillne&s;s came over her, and &s;he &s;at fixed in her chair. At length a deep &s;igh &s;omewhat relieved her oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, and her &s;en&s;es &s;eemed to return.</P>
<P>All remaining quiet, after &s;ome time &s;he began to que&s;tion whether her fancy had not deceived her, and &s;he &s;o far conquered her terror as to de&s;i&s;t from calling Madame La Motte: her mind was, however, &s;o much di&s;turbed, that &s;he did not venture to tru&s;t her&s;elf that night again with the MS. but having &s;pent &s;ome time in prayer, and in endeavouring to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, &s;he retired to bed.</P>
<P>When &s;he awoke in the morning, the cheerful &s;un beams played upon the ca&s;ements, and di&s;pelled the illu&s;ions of dark|ne&s;s: her mind, &s;oothed and invigorated by &s;leep, rejected the my&s;tic and turbulent promptings of imagination. She aro&s;e re|fre&s;hed and thankful; but, upon going down to breakfa&s;t, this tran&s;ient gleam of peace fled upon the appearance of the Marquis, who&s;e frequent vi&s;its at the abbey, after what had pa&s;&s;ed, not only di&s;plea&s;ed, but alarmed her. She &s;aw that he was deter|mined to per&s;evere in addre&s;&s;ing her, and the boldne&s;s and in&s;en|&s;ibility of this conduct, while it excited her indignation, increa&s;ed her di&s;gu&s;t. In pity to La Motte, &s;he endeavoured to conceal the&s;e emotions, though &s;he now thought that he required too much from her complai&s;ance, and began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider how &s;he might avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing it. The Marquis behaved to her with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful attention: but Adeline was &s;ilent and re&s;erved, and &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity of with|drawing.</P>
<P>As &s;he pa&s;&s;ed up the &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e, Peter entered the hall below, and &s;eeing Adeline, he &s;topped and looked earne&s;tly at her: &s;he did not ob&s;erve him, but he called her &s;oftly, and &s;he then &s;aw him make a &s;ignal as if he had &s;omething to commu|nicate. In the next in&s;tant La Motte opened the door of the vaulted room, and Peter ha&s;tily di&s;appeared. She proceeded to her chamber, ruminating upon this &s;ignal, and the cautious man|ner in which Peter had given it.</P>
<P>But her thoughts &s;oon returned to their wonted &s;ubjects. Three days were now pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;he heard no intelligence of her father; &s;he began to hope that he had relented from the violent mea&s;ures hinted at by La Motte, and that he meant to pur&s;ue a milder plan; but when &s;he con&s;idered his character, this appeared improbable, and &s;he relap&s;ed into her former fears. Her re&s;idence at the abbey was now become painful, from the
<PB N="124" REF="029379_0063_0FE08B69F177D568">
per&s;everance of the Marquis, and the conduct which La Motte obliged her to adopt; yet &s;he could not think without dread of quitting it to return to her father.</P>
<P>The image of Theodore often intruded upon her bu&s;y thoughts, and brought with it a pang; which his &s;trange de|parture occa&s;ioned. She had a confu&s;ed notion, that his fate was &s;omehow connected with her own; and her &s;truggles to prevent the remembrance of him, &s;erved only to &s;hew how much her heart was his.</P>
<P>To divert her thoughts from the&s;e &s;ubjects, and gratify the curio&s;ity &s;o &s;trongly excited on the preceding night, &s;he now took up the MS. but was hindered from opening it by the en|trance of Madame La Motte, who come to tell her that the Marquis was gone. They pa&s;&s;ed their morning together in work and general conver&s;ation; La Motte not appearing till dinner, when he &s;aid little, and Adeline le&s;s. She a&s;ked him however, if he had heard from her father?</P>
<P>"I have not heard from him," &s;aid La Motte; "but there is good rea&s;on, as I am informed by the Marquis, to believe he is not far off."</P>
<P>Adeline was &s;hocked, yet &s;he was able to reply with becom|ing firmne&s;s. "I have already, Sir, envolved you too much in my di&s;tre&s;s, and now &s;ee that re&s;i&s;tance will de&s;troy you, without &s;erving me; I am, therefore contented to return to my father, and thus &s;pare you farther calamity."</P>
<P>"This is a ra&s;h determination," replied La Motte, "and if you pur&s;ue it, I fear you will &s;everely repent. I &s;peak to you as a friend, Adeline, and de&s;ire you will endeavour to li&s;ten to me without prejudice. The Marquis, I find, has offered you his hand. I know not which circum&s;tance mo&s;t excites my &s;urpri&s;e, that a man of his rank and con&s;equence &s;hould &s;olicit a marriage with a per&s;on without fortune, or often&s;ible connec|tions; or that a per&s;on &s;o circum&s;tanced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld even for a moment reject the advantages thus offered her.

Still you are &s;ilent."</P>
<P>The angui&s;h which this &s;peech excited, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her utter|ance, and &s;he continued to weep. At length &s;he &s;aid. "Suffer

"Strange infatua|tion," &s;aid he; "is it po&s;&s;ible that you can per&s;i&s;t in this he|roi&s;m of romance, and prefer a father &s;o inhuman as yours, to the Marquis de Montalt!

<P>"Pardon me, "&s;aid Adeline, "a marriage with the Mar|quis would be &s;plendid, but never happy. His character excites my aver&s;ion, and I entreat, Sir, that he may no more be mentioned.</P>

<P>THE conver&s;ation related in the la&s;t chapter was interrupt|ed by the entrance of Peter, who, as he left the room, looked &s;ignificantly at Adeline and almo&s;t beckened. She was anxious to know what he meant, and &s;oon after went into the hall, where &s;he found him loitering. The moment he &s;aw her, he made a &s;ign of &s;ilence and beckoned her into the rece&s;s. "Well, Peter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is it you would &s;ay?" &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h, Ma'm&s;elle, for Heaven's &s;ake &s;peak lower: if we &s;hould be overheard, we are all blown up."&mdash;Adeline begged him to explain what he meant. "Yes, Ma'm&s;elle, that is what I have wanted all day long. I have watched and watched for an opportunity, and looked and looked, till I was afraid my ma&s;ter him&s;elf would &s;ee me: but all would not do; you would not under&s;tand."</P>
<P>Adeline entreated he would be quick. "Yes Ma'am, but I'm &s;o afraid we &s;hall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but I would do much to &s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;uch a good young lady as you, for I could not bear to think of what threatened you without telling you of it."</P>
<P>"For God's &s;ake," &s;aid Adeline, "&s;peak quickly, or we &s;hall be interrupted."</P>
<P>"Well, then; but you mu&s;t fir&s;t promi&s;e by the Holy Virgin never to &s;ay it was I that told you. My ma&s;ter would"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="029379_0064_0FE08B6ED90096C8">"I do, I do!" &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P>"Well, then&mdash;on Monday evening as I&mdash;hark! did not I hear a &s;tep? do, Ma'm&s;elle, ju&s;t &s;tep this way to the cloi&s;ters. I would not for the world, we &s;hould be &s;een." I'll go out at the hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or and you can go through the pa&s;&s;age. I would not for the world we &s;hould be &s;een." &mdash;Adeline was much alarmed by Peter's words, and hurried to the cloi&s;ters. He quickly appeared, and, looking cautiou&s;ly round, re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e. "As I was &s;aying, Ma'm&s;elle, Monday night, when the Marquis &s;lept here, you know he &s;at up very late, and I can gue&s;s, perhaps, the rea&s;on of that. Strange things came out, but is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to tell all I think."</P>
<P>"Pray do &s;peak to the purpo&s;e," &s;aid Adeline impatiently, "what is this danger which you &s;ay threatens me? Be quick, or we &s;hall be ob&s;erved."</P>
<P>"Danger enough, Ma'm&s;elle," replied Peter, "if you knew all, and when you do, what will it &s;ignify, for you can't help your&s;elf. But that's neither here or there: I was re&s;olved to tell you, though I may repent it."</P>
<P>"Or rather you are re&s;olved not to tell me&punc;" &s;aid Adelie; "for you have made no progre&s;s towards it. But what do you mean? You was &s;peaking of the Marquis."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h, Ma'am, not &s;o loud. The Marquis, as I &s;aid, &s;at up very late and my ma&s;ter &s;at up with him. One of his men went to bed in the oak room, and the other &s;taid to undre&s;s his Lord. So as we were &s;itting together&mdash;Lord have mercy! it made my hair &s;tand on end! I tremble yet. So as we were &s;itting together&mdash;but as &s;ure as I live yonder is my ma&s;ter: I caught a glimp&s;e of him between the trees, if he &s;ees me it is all over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith us. I'll tell you another time." So &s;aying, he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed into the abbey, leaving Adeline in a &s;tate of alarm, curio&s;ity and vexation. She walked out into the fore&s;t, ruminating up|on Peter's words, and endeavouring to gue&s;s to what they allud|ed; there Madame La Motte joined her, and they conver&s;ed on various topics till they reached the abbey.</P>
<P>Adeline watched in vain through that day, for an opportu|nity of &s;peaking with Peter. While he waited at &s;upper&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> occa&s;ionally, ob&s;erved his countenance with great anxiety, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing it might afford her &s;ome degree of intelligence on the &s;ub|ject of her fears. When &s;he retired, Madame La Motte ac|companied her to her chamber, and continued to conver&s;e with her for a con&s;iderable time, &s;o that &s;he had no means of obtain|ing an interview with Peter.&mdash;Madame La Motte appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="127" REF="029379_0064_0FE08B6ED90096C8">
labour under &s;ome great affliction, and when Adeline, noticing this, entreated to know the cau&s;e of her dejection, tears &s;tarted into her eyes, and &s;he abruptly left the room.</P>
<P>This behaviour of Madame La Motte concurred with Peter's di&s;cour&s;e, to alarm Adeline, who &s;at pen&s;ively upon her bed, given up to reflection, till &s;he was rou&s;ed by the &s;ound of a clock which &s;tood in the room below, and which now &s;truck twelve. She was preparing for re&s;t, when &s;he recollected the MS. and was unable to conclude the night without reading it. The fir&s;t words &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h were the following.</P>
<P>"Again I return to this poor con&s;olation&mdash;again I have been permitted to &s;ee another day. It is now midnight! my &s;oli|tary lamp burns be&s;ide me; the time is awful, but to me the &s;ilence of noon is as the &s;ilence of midnight: a deeper gloom is all in which they differ. The &s;till, unvarying hours are num|bered only by my &s;ufferings! Great God! when &s;hall I be re|lea&s;ed!</P>
<P>"But whence this &s;trange confinement? I have never injured him. If death is de&s;igned me, why this delay; and for what but death am I brought hither? This abbey&mdash;alas,"&mdash;Here the MS. was again illegible, and for &s;everal pages Adeline could only make out disjointed &s;entences.</P>
<P>"O bitter draught! when, when &s;hall I have re&s;t! O my friends will none of ye fly to aid me; will none of ye avenge my &s;ufferings? Ah! when it is too late&mdash;when I am gone for ever, ye will endeavour to avenge them. * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>
<P>"Once more is night returned to me. Another day has pa&s;&s;ed in &s;olitude and mi&s;ery. I have climbed to the ca&s;ement thinking the view of nature would refre&s;h my &s;oul, and &s;ome|what enable me to &s;upport the&s;e afflictions. Alas! even this &s;mall comfort is denied me, the windows open towards other parts of this abbey, and admit only a portion of that day which I mu&s;t never more fully behold. La&s;t night! la&s;t night! O &s;cene of horror!" * *</P>
<P>"Adeline &s;huddered. She feared to read the coming &s;entence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t curio&s;ity prompted her to proceed. Still &s;he pau&s;ed: an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ccountable dread came over her. "Some horrid deed has been done here," &s;aid &s;he; "the reports of the pea&s;ants are true. Murder has been committed." The idea thrilled her with horror. She recollected the dagger which had impeded her &s;teps in the &s;ecret chamber, and this circum&s;tance &s;erved to confirm her mo&s;t terrible conjectures. She wi&s;hed to examine

it, but it lay in one of the&s;e chambers, and &s;he feared to go in que&s;t of it.</P>
<P>"Wretched, wretched victim!" &s;he exclaimed, "could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> friend ri&s;que thee from de&s;truction! O that I had been near! yet what could I have done to &s;ave thee? Alas! nothing. I forget that even now, perhaps, I am like thee abandoned to dangers, from which I have no friend to &s;uccour me. Too &s;urely I gue&s;s the author of my mi&s;eries!" She &s;topped and thought &s;he heard a &s;igh, &s;uch as, on the preceding night had pa&s;&s;ed along the chamber. Her blood was chilled and &s;he &s;at motionle&s;s. The lonely &s;ituation of her room, remote from the re&s;t of the family, (for &s;he was now in her old apartment, from which Madame La Motte had removed) who were almo&s;t be|yond call, &s;truck &s;o forcibly upon her imagination, that &s;he with difficulty pre&s;erved her&s;elf from fainting. She &s;at for a con&s;iderable time, but all was &s;till. When &s;he was &s;omewhat recovered, her fir&s;t de&s;ign was to alarm the family; but farther reflection again withheld her.</P>
<P>She endeavoured to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, and addre&s;&s;ed a &s;hort prayer to that Being who had hitherto protected her in eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> danger. While &s;he was thus employed, her mind gradually became ellevated and re-a&s;&s;ured; a &s;ublime complacency filled her heart, and &s;he &s;at down once more to pur&s;ue the narrative.</P>
<P>Several lines that immediately followed were obliterated. * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>

mind. The reports concerning the abbey&mdash;the dreams, which had forerun her di&s;covery of the private apartments&mdash;the &s;in|gular manner in which &s;he had found the MS. and the appari|tion, which &s;he now believed &s;he had really &s;een. She blamed her&s;elf for having not yet mentioned the di&s;covery of the man|u&s;cript and chambers to La Motte, and re&s;olved to delay the di&s;clo&s;ure no longer than the following morning. The im|mediate cares that had occupied her mind, and a fear of lo&s;ing the manu&s;cipt before &s;he had read it, had hitherto kept her &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Such a combination of circum&s;tances &s;he believed could only be produced by &s;ome &s;upernatural power, operating for the re|tribution of the guilty. The&s;e reflections filled her mind with a degree of awe, which the loneline&s;s of the large old chamber in which &s;he &s;at, and the hour of the night, &s;oon heightened into terror. She had never been &s;uper&s;titious, but circum&s;tances &s;o uncommon had hitherto con&s;pired in this affair, that &s;he could not believe them accidental. Her imagination, wrought upon by the&s;e reflections, again became &s;en&s;ible to every impre&s;&s;ion, &s;he feared to look around, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould again &s;ee &s;ome dread|ful phantom, and &s;he almo&s;t fancied &s;he heard voices &s;well in the &s;torm, which now &s;hook the fabric.</P>
<P>Still &s;he tried to command her feelings &s;o as to avoid di&s;turb|ing the family, but they became &s;o painful, that even the dread of La Motte's ridicule had hardly power to prevent her quitting the chamber. Her mind was now in &s;uch a &s;tate, that &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to pur&s;ue the &s;tory in the MS. though to avoid the tortures of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;he had attempted it. She laid it down again and tried to argue her&s;elf into compo&s;ure. "What have I to fear?" &s;aid &s;he, "I am at lea&s;t innocent, and I &s;hall not be puni&s;hed for the crime of another."</P>
<P>The violent gu&s;t of wind that now ru&s;hed through the whole &s;uite of apartments &s;hook the door that led from her late bed-chamber to the private rooms &s;o forcibly, that Adeline, unable to remain longer in doubt, ran to &s;ee from whence the noi&s;e i&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; The arras, which concealed the door, was violently agi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;he &s;tood for a moment ob&s;erving it in inde&s;cribable terror, till, believing it was &s;wayed by the wind, &s;he made a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dden effort to overcome her feelings, and was &s;tooping to rai&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. At that in&s;tant, &s;he thought &s;he heard a voice, &s;he &s;topped and li&s;tened, but every thing was &s;till; yet apprehen&s;ion &s;o far overcame her, that &s;he had no power, either to examine, or to leave the chambers.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="029379_0066_0FE08B80B213DAD0">In a few moments the voice returned, &s;he was now convinced &s;he had not been deceived, for though low, &s;he heard it di&s;tinctly and was almo&s;t &s;ure it repeated her own name.

<P>How long &s;he remained in this &s;tate &s;he knew not, but when &s;he recovered, &s;he exerted all her &s;trength, and reached the wind|ing &s;tairca&s;e, where &s;he called aloud.

<P>"She was not pre&s;ent at this conver&s;ation then?" &s;aid Ade|line. "No, Ma'am&s;elle, but my ma&s;ter has told her of it, I warrant." Adeline was almo&s;t as much &s;hocked by this ap|parent perfidy of Madame La Motte, as by a knowledge of the de&s;truction that threatened her.

<P>"O!" replied Adeline, in extreme emotion, "we fly from enemies; &s;trangers may prove friends: a&s;&s;i&s;t me but to e&s;cape from this fore&s;t, and you will claim my eternal gratitude: I have no fears beyond it."</P>
<P>"Why, as for this fore&s;t," replied Peter, I am weary of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my&s;elf; though, when we fir&s;t came, I thought it would be fine living here, at lea&s;t, I thought it was very different from any life I had ever lived before.

<P>"You con&s;ent, then, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in e&s;caping?" &s;aid Adeline with eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Why as to that, Ma'am&s;elle, I would willingly if I knew where to go. To be &s;ure I have a &s;i&s;ter lives in Savoy, but that is a great way off: and I have &s;aved a little money out of my wages, but that won't carry us &s;uch a long journey."</P>
<P>"Regard not that," &s;aid Adeline, "If I was once beyond this fore&s;t I would then endeavour to take care of my&s;elf, and repay you for your kindne&s;s."</P>

<P>"Yes, Ma'am&s;elle, to night, about dark.

Then, while they're &s;earching in the place under ground for you, I can &s;lip away, and we &s;hould be out of their reach, be|fore they thought of pur&s;uing us."</P>
<P>Adeline agreed to the truth of all this, and was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed at Peter's &s;agacity. She inquired if he knew of any place in the neighbourhood of the abbey, where &s;he could re|main concealed ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he came with the hor&s;e. "Why yes, Ma|dam there is a place, now I think of it where you may be &s;afe enough, for no body goes near: but they &s;ay it's haunted, and, perhaps, you would not like to go there." Adeline, remem|bering the la&s;t night, was &s;omewhat &s;tartled at this intelligence; but a &s;en&s;e of her pre&s;ent danger pre&s;&s;ed again upon her mind, and overcame every other apprehen&s;ion. Where is this place?" &s;aid &s;he, "if it will conceal me, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to go."</P>
<P>"It is an old tomb that &s;tands in the thicke&s;t part of the fore&s;t about a quarter of a mile off the neare&s;t way, and almo&s;t a mile the other. When my ma&s;ter u&s;ed to hide him&s;elf &s;o much in the fore&s;t, I have followed him &s;omewhere thereabouts, but I did not find out the tomb till the other day. However, that's neither here nor there; if you dare venture to it, Ma'am|&s;elle, I'll &s;hew you the neare&s;t way." So &s;aying, he pointed to a winding path on the right. Adeline, having looked round without perceiving any per&s;on near, directed Peter to lead her to the tomb: they pur&s;ued the path till turning into a gloomy romantic part of the fore&s;t almo&s;t impervious to the rays of the &s;un, they came to the &s;pot whither Louis had formerly traced his father.</P>

Abbot," &s;aid he, "was formerly buried here as the Marquis's people &s;ay; and it's like enough that he belonged to the abbey yonder. But I don't &s;ee why he &s;hould take it in his head to walk; <HI>he</HI> was not murdered, &s;urely?"</P>
<P>"I hope not," &s;aid Adeline.</P>
<P>"That's more than can be &s;aid for all that lies buried at the abbey though, and"&mdash;Adeline interrupted him; "Hark! &s;urely I hear a noi&s;e?" &s;aid &s;he, "Heaven protect us from di&s;|covery!" They li&s;tened, but all was &s;till, and they went on. Peter opened a low door, and they entered upon a dark pa&s;&s;age, frequently ob&s;tructed by lo&s;e fragments of &s;tone, and along which they moved with caution. Whither are we going?" &s;aid Adeline&mdash;"I &s;carcely know my&s;elf," &s;aid Peter, "for I ne|ver was &s;o far before; but the place &s;eems quite enough." Some|thing ob&s;tructed his way; it was a door, which yielded to his hand, and di&s;covered a kind of cell, ob&s;curely &s;een by the twi|light admitted through a grate above. A partial gleam &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> athwart the place, leaving the greate&s;t part of it in &s;hadow.</P>
<P>Adeline &s;ighed as &s;he &s;urveyed it. "This is a frightful &s;pot, &s;aid &s;he, "but if it will afford me a &s;helter, it is a palace. Re|member, Peter, that my peace and honour depend upon your faithfulne&s;s; be both di&s;creet and re&s;olute. In the du&s;k of the evening I can pa&s;s from the abbey with lea&s;t danger of being ob&s;erved, and in this cell I will wait your arrival.

For Heaven's &s;ake be cau|tious, and be punctual."</P>
<P>"I will, Ma'am&s;elle, let come what may."</P>
<P>They re-a&s;cended to the fore&s;t, and Adeline fearful of ob&s;er|vation, directed Peter to run fa&s;t to the abbey, and invent &s;ome excu&s;e for his ab&s;ence, if he had been mi&s;&s;ed. When &s;he was again alone, &s;he yielded to a flood of tears, and indulged the exce&s;s of her di&s;tre&s;s. She &s;aw her&s;elf without friends, without relations, de&s;titute, forlorn, and abandoned to the wor&s;t of evils. Betrayed by the very per&s;ons, to who&s;e comfort &s;he had &s;o long admini&s;tered, whom &s;he had loved as her protectors, and revered as her parents! The&s;e reflections touched her heart with the mo&s;t afflicting &s;en&s;ations, and the &s;en&s;e of her imme|diate danger was for a while ab&s;orbed in the grief occa&s;ioned by a di&s;covery of &s;uch guilt in others.</P>
<P>At length &s;he rou&s;ed all her fortitude, and turning towards the abbey, endeavoured to await with patience the hour of even|ing,
<PB N="137" REF="029379_0069_0FE08B9F52B5B7F8">
and to &s;u&s;tain an appearance, of compo&s;ure in the pre|&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte. For the pre&s;ent &s;he wi&s;hed to avoid &s;eeing either of them, doubting her ability to di&s;gui&s;e her emotions: having reached the abbey, &s;he therefore pa&s;&s;ed on to her chamber. Here &s;he endeavoured to direct her attention to indifferent &s;ubjects, but in vain; the danger of her &s;ituation, and the &s;evere di&s;appointment &s;he had received, in the character of tho&s;e whom &s;he had &s;o much e&s;teemed, and even loved, pre&s;&s;ed hard upon her thoughts. To a generous mind few circum&s;tances are more afflicting than a di&s;covery of perfidy in tho&s;e whom we have tru&s;ted, even though it may fail of any ab&s;olute inconvenience to our&s;elves. The behaviour of Madame La Motte in thus, by concealment, con|&s;piring to her de&s;truction, particularly &s;hocked her.</P>
<P>"How has my imagination deceived me!" &s;aid &s;he; "what a picture did it draw of the goodne&s;s of the world! And mu&s;t I then believe that every body is cruel and deceitful? No&mdash; let me &s;till be deceived, and &s;till &s;uffer, rather than be con|demned to a &s;tate of &s;uch wretched &s;u&s;picion." She now en|deavoured to extenute the conduct of Madame La Motte, by attributing it to a fear of her hu&s;band. "She dare not op|po&s;e his will," &s;aid &s;he, "el&s;e &s;he would warn me of my dan|ger, and a&s;&s;i&s;t me to e&s;cape from it. No&mdash;I will never believe her capable of con&s;piring my ruin. Terror alone keeps her &s;ilent."</P>
<P>Adeline was &s;omewhat comforted by this thought. The good|ne&s;s of her heart taught her, in this in&s;tance, to &s;ophi&s;ticate. She perceived not, that by a&s;cribing the conduct of Madame La Motte to terror, &s;he only &s;oftened the degree of her guilt, im|puting it to a motive le&s;s depraved, but not le&s;s &s;elfi&s;h. She remained in her chamber till &s;ummoned to dinner, when, dry|ing her tears, &s;he de&s;cended with faltering &s;teps and a palpita|ting heart to the parlour. When &s;he &s;aw La Motte, in &s;pite of all her efforts. She trembled and grew pale: &s;he could not be|hold, even with apparent indifference, the man who &s;he knew had de&s;tined her to de&s;truction. He ob&s;erved her emotion, and inquiring if &s;he was ill, &s;he &s;aw the danger to which her agita|tion expo&s;ed her.

<P>During dinner &s;he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erved a degree of compo&s;ure, that ef|fectually concealed the varied angui&s;h of her heart. When &s;he looked at La Motte, terror and indignation were her prodimi|nant

feelings; but when &s;he regarded Madame La Motte, it was otherwi&s;e; gratitude for her former tenderne&s;s had long been confirmed into affection and her heart now &s;welled with the bitterne&s;s of grief and di&s;appointment. Madame La Motte appeared depre&s;&s;ed, and &s;aid little. La Motte &s;eemed anxious to prevent thought, by a&s;&s;uming a fictitious and unnatural gaie|ty: he laughed and talked, and threw off frequent bumpers of wine: it was the mirth of de&s;peration. Madame became alarm|med, and would have re&s;trained him, but he per&s;i&s;ted in his li|bations to Bacchus till reflection &s;eemed to be almo&s;t overcome.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte, fearful that in the carele&s;sne&s;s of the pre|&s;ent moment he might betray him&s;elf, withdrew with Adeline to another room. Adeline recollected the happy hours &s;he once pa&s;&s;ed with her, when confidence bani&s;hed re&s;erve, and &s;ympathy and e&s;teem dictated the &s;entiments of friend&s;hip: now tho&s;e hours were gone for ever; &s;he could no longer unbo&s;om her griefs to Madame La Motte; no longer even e&s;teem her. Yet notwith&s;tanding all the danger to which &s;he was expo&s;ed by the criminal &s;ilence of the latter, &s;he could not conver&s;e with her, con&s;ciou&s;ly for the la&s;t time, without feeling a degree of &s;orrow, which wi&s;dom may call weakne&s;s, but to which bene|volence will allow a &s;ofter name.</P>
<P>Madame La Motte, in her conver&s;ation, appeared to labour under an almo&s;t equal oppre&s;&s;ion with Adeline: her thoughts were ab&s;tracted from the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and there we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> long and frequent intervals of &s;ilence. Adeline more than once caught her gazing with a look of tenderne&s;s upon her, and &s;aw her eyes fill with tears. By this circum&s;tance &s;he was &s;o much affected, that, &s;he was &s;everal times upon the point of throwing her&s;elf at her feet, and imploring her pity and pro|tection. Cooler reflection &s;hewed her the extravagance and danger of this conduct; &s;he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her emotions, but they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> length compelled her to withdraw from the pre&s;ence of Ma|dame La Motte.</P>

<P>ADELINE anxiou&s;ly watched from her chamber window the &s;un &s;et behind the di&s;tant hills, and the time of her depar|ture draw nigh: it &s;et with uncommon &s;plendor, and threw a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gleam athwart the woods, and upon &s;ome &s;cattered frag|ments of the ruins, which &s;he could not gaze upon with indif|ference. "Never, probably, again &s;hall I &s;ee the &s;un &s;ink below tho&s;e hills," &s;aid &s;he, "or illumine this &s;cene! Where &s;hall I be when next it &s;ets&mdash;where this time tomorrow? &s;unk, per|haps in mi&s;ery!" She wept to the thought. "A few hours," re&s;umed Adeline, "and the Marquis will arrive&mdash;a few hours, and this abbey will be a &s;cene of confu&s;ion and tumult: every eye will be in &s;earch of me, every rece&s;s will be explored." The&s;e reflections in&s;pired her with new terror, and increa&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> impatience to be gone.</P>
<P>Twilight gradually came on, and &s;he now thought it &s;uf|ficiently dark to venture forth; but, before &s;he went, &s;he kneel|ed down, and addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven. She implored &s;upport and protection, and committed her&s;elf to the care of the God of mercies. Having done this, &s;he quitted her cham|ber, and pa&s;&s;ed with cautious &s;teps down the winding &s;tairca&s;e. No per&s;on appeared, and &s;he proceeded through the door of the tower into the fore&s;t. She loooked around; the gloom of the evening ob&s;cured every object.</P>
<P>With a trembling heart &s;he &s;ought the path pointed out by Peter, which led to the tomb; having found it, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed along forlorn and terrified. Often did &s;he &s;tart as the breeze &s;hook the light leaves of the trees, or as the bat flitted by, gamboling in the twilight; and often, as &s;he looked back towards the ab|bey, thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed, amid the deepening gloom, the figures of men. Having proceeded &s;ome way, &s;he &s;uddenly heard the feet of hor&s;es, and &s;oon after a &s;ound of voices, among
<PB N="140" REF="029379_0071_0FE08BB23659DD38">
which &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed that of the Marquis: they &s;eemed to come from the quarter &s;he was approa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing, and evidently ad|vanced. Terror for &s;ome minutes arre&s;ted her &s;teps; &s;he &s;tood in a &s;tate of dreadful he&s;itation: to proceed was to run into the hands of the Marquis; to return was to fall into the power of La Motte.</P>
<P>After remaining for &s;ome time uncertain whither to fly, the &s;ounds &s;uddenly took a different direction, and wheeled towards the abbey. Adeline had a &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation of terror. She now under&s;tood that the Marquis had pa&s;&s;ed this &s;pot only in his way to the abbey, and &s;he ha&s;tened to &s;ecret her&s;elf in the ruin. At length, after much difficulty &s;he reached it, the deep &s;hades almo&s;t concealing it from her &s;earch. She pau&s;ed at the en|trance, awed by the &s;olemnity that reigned within, and the ut|ter darkne&s;s of the place; at length &s;he determined to watch without till Peter &s;hould arrive. "If any per&s;on approaches," &s;aid &s;he, "I can hear them before they can &s;ee me, and I can then &s;ecret my&s;elf in the cell."</P>
<P>She leaned again&s;t a fragment of the tomb in trembling ex|pectation, and as &s;he li&s;tened, no &s;ound broke the &s;ilence of the hour. The &s;tate of her mind can only be imagined, by con|&s;idering that upon the pre&s;ent time turned the cri&s;is of her fate. "They have now," thought &s;he, "di&s;covered my flight; even now they are &s;eeking me in every part of the abbey. I hear their dreadful voices call me; I &s;ee their eager looks." The power of imagination almo&s;t overcame her. While &s;he yet looked around, &s;he &s;aw lights moving at a di&s;tance; &s;ometimes they glimmered between the trees&punc; and &s;ometimes they totally di&s;|appeared.</P>
<P>They &s;eemed to be in a direction with the abbey: and &s;he now remembered, that in the morning &s;he had &s;een a part of the fabric through an opening in the fore&s;t. She had, therefore, no doubt that the lights &s;he &s;aw proceeded from people in &s;earch of her; who, &s;he feared, not finding her at the abbey, might direct their &s;teps towards the tomb. Her place of refuge now &s;eemed too near her enemies to be &s;afe, and &s;he would have fled to a more di&s;tant part of the fore&s;t, but recollected that Peter would not know where to find her.</P>
<P>While the&s;e thoughts pa&s;&s;ed over her mind, &s;he heard di&s;tant voices in the wind, and was ha&s;tening to conceal her&s;elf in the cell, when &s;he ob&s;erved the lights &s;uddenly di&s;appear. All was &s;oon after hu&s;hed in &s;ilence and darkne&s;s, yet &s;he endeavoured to find the way to the cell. She remembered the &s;ituation of the
<PB N="141" REF="029379_0071_0FE08BB23659DD38">
outer door and of the pa&s;&s;age, and having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e, &s;he un|clo&s;ed the door of the cell. Within it was utterly dark. She trembled violently, but entered; and having felt about the walls, at length &s;eated her&s;elf on a projection of &s;tone.</P>
<P>She here again addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven, and, endeavour|ed to reanimate her &s;pirits till Peter &s;hould arrive. Above half an hour elap&s;ed in this gloomy rece&s;s, and no &s;ound fore|told his approach. Her &s;pirits &s;unk, &s;he feared &s;ome part of their plan was di&s;covered, or interrupted, and that he was detain|ed by La Motte. This conviction operated &s;ometimes &s;o &s;trongly upon her fears, as to urge her to quit the cell alone, and &s;eek in flight her only chance of e&s;cape.</P>
<P>While this de&s;ign was fluctuating in her mind, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed through the grate above a clattering of hoofs. The noi&s;e ap|proached, and at length &s;topped at the tomb. In the &s;ucceeding moment &s;he heard three &s;trokes of a whip: her heart beat, and for &s;ome moments her agitation was &s;uch, that &s;he made no effort to quit the cell. The &s;trokes were repeated: &s;he now rou&s;ed her &s;pirits, and, &s;tepping forward, a&s;cended to the fore&s;t. She called "Peter;" for the deep gloom would not permit her to di&s;tingui&s;h either man or hor&s;e. She was quickly an&s;wered, "Hu&s;h! Ma'am&s;elle, our voices will betray us."</P>
<P>They mounted and rode off as fa&s;t as the darkne&s;s would per|mit. Adeline's heart revived at eveey &s;tep they took. She in|quired what had pa&s;&s;ed at the abbey, and how he had contrived to get away. "Speak &s;oftly, Ma'am&s;elle; you'll know all by and by, but I can't tell you now." He had &s;carcely &s;poke ere they &s;aw lights move along at a di&s;tance; and coming now to a more open part of the fore&s;t, he &s;et off on a full gallop, and con|tinued the pace till the hor&s;e could hold it no longer. They looked back, and no lights appearing, Adeline's terror &s;ub&s;ided. She inquired again what had pa&s;&s;ed at the abbey, when her flight was di&s;covered. "You may &s;peak without fear of being heard," &s;aid &s;he, "we are gone beyond their reach I hope."</P>
<P>"Why, Ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid he, "you had not been gone long before the Marquis arrived, and Mon&s;ieur La Motte then found out you was fled. Upon this a great rout there was, and he talked a great deal with the Marquis."</P>
<P>"Speak louder," &s;aid Adeline, "I cannot hear you."</P>
<P>"I will Ma'am&s;elle."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh! Heavens!" interrupted Adeline, what voice is this? It is not Peter's. For God's &s;ake tell me who you are, and whither I am going?"</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="029379_0072_0FE08BB847F33F70">"You'll know that &s;oon enough, young lady," an&s;wered the &s;tranger, for it was indeed not Peter; "I am taking you where my ma&s;ter ordered." Adeline, not doubting he was the Marquis's &s;ervant, attempted to leap to the ground, but the man di&s;mount|ing, bound her to the hor&s;e. One feeble ray of hope at length beamed upon her mind: &s;he endeavoured to &s;often the man to pity, and pleaded with all the genuine eloquence of di&s;tre&s;s; but he under&s;tood his intere&s;t too well to yield even for a moment to the compa&s;&s;ion, which, in &s;pite of him&s;elf, her artle&s;s &s;uppli|cation in&s;pired.</P>
<P>She now re&s;igned her&s;elf to de&s;pair, and, in pa&s;&s;ive &s;ilence, &s;ubmitted to her fate. They continued thus to travel, till a &s;torm of rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, drove them to the covert of a thick grove. The man believed this a &s;afe &s;ituation, and Adeline was now too carle&s;s of life to attempt convincing him of his error. The &s;torm was violent and long, but as &s;oon as it abated they &s;et off on full gallop, and having continued to travel for about two hours, they came to the bor|ders of the fore&s;t, and &s;oon after, to a high lonely wall, which Adeline could ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h by the moonlight, which now &s;treamed through the parting clouds.</P>
<P>Here they &s;topped; the man di&s;mounted, and having opened a &s;mall door in the wall, he unbound Adeline, who &s;hrieked, though involuntarily and in vain, as he took her from the hor&s;e. The door opened upon a narrow pa&s;&s;age, dimly lighted by a lamp, which hung at the farther end. He led her on; they came to another door; it opened and di&s;clo&s;ed a magnificent &s;aloon, &s;plendidly illuminated, and fitted up in the mo&s;t airy and elegant ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The walls were painted in fre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, repre&s;enting &s;cenes from Ovid, and hung above with &s;ilk drawn up in fe&s;toons and richly fringed. The &s;ofas were of a &s;ilk to &s;uit the hangings. From the centre of the ceiling, which exhibited a &s;cene from the Ar|mida of Ta&s;&s;o, de&s;cended a &s;ilver lamp of Etru&s;can form; it diffu&s;ed a blaze of light that reflected from large pier gla&s;&s;es, completely illuminated the &s;aloon. Bu&s;ts of Horace, Ovid An|acreon, Tibullus, and Petronius Arbiter, adorned the rece&s;&s;es, and &s;tands of flowers, placed in Etru&s;can va&s;es, breathed the mo&s;t delicious perfume. In the middle of the apartment &s;tood a &s;mall table, &s;pread with a collation of fruits, ices and liquors. No per&s;on appeared. The whole &s;eemed the works of enchant|ment, and rather re&s;embled the palace of a fairy than any thing of human conformation.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="029379_0072_0FE08BB847F33F70">Adeline was a&s;toni&s;hed, and inquired were &s;he was, but the man refu&s;ed to an&s;wer her que&s;tions, and having de&s;ired her to take &s;ome refre&s;hment, left her. She walked to the windows, from which a gleam of moonlight di&s;covered to her an exten|&s;ive garden, where groves and lawns, and water glittering in the moonbeam, compo&s;ed a &s;cenery of varied and romantic beauty. "What can this mean!" &s;aid &s;he: "Is this a charm to lure me to de&s;truction? She endeavoured, with a hope of e&s;caping, to open the windows, but they were all fa&s;|tened; &s;he next attempted &s;everal doors, and found them al&s;o &s;ecured.</P>
<P>Perceiving all chance of e&s;cape was removed &s;he remained for &s;ome time given up to &s;orrow and reflection; but was at length drawn from her reverie by the notes of &s;oft mu&s;ic, breathing &s;uch dulcet and entrancing &s;ounds, as &s;u&s;pended grief, and awakened the &s;oul to tenderne&s;s and pen&s;ive plea&s;ure. Ade|line li&s;tened in &s;urpri&s;e, and in&s;en&s;ibly became &s;oothed and in|tere&s;ted; a tender melancholy &s;tole upon her heart, and &s;ubdu|ed every ha&s;her feeling: but the moment the &s;train cea&s;ed, the enchantment di&s;&s;olved, and &s;he returned to a &s;en&s;e of her &s;itua|tion.</P>
<P>Again the mu&s;ic &s;ounded&mdash;"mu&s;ic &s;uch as charmeth &s;leep" and again &s;he gradually yielded to its &s;weet magic. A female voice accompanied by a lute, a hautboy, and a few other in|&s;truments, now gradually &s;welled into a tone &s;o exqui&s;ite, as rai&s;ed attention into ec&s;tacy. It &s;unk by degrees, and touched a few &s;imple notes with pathetic &s;oftne&s;s, when the mea&s;ure was &s;uddenly changed, and in a gay and airy melody Adeline di&s;tingui&s;hed the following words:

<P><PB N="144" REF="029379_0073_0FE08BC72A8B6F08">The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed, but the &s;ound &s;till vibrated on her imag|ination, and &s;he was &s;unk in the plea&s;ing languor they had in|&s;pired, when the door opened, and the Marquis de Montalt appeared. He approached the &s;ofa where Adeline &s;at, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed her, but &s;he heard not his voice&mdash;&s;he had fainted. He endeavoured to recover her, and at length &s;ucceeded; but when &s;he unclo&s;ed her eyes, and again beheld him, &s;he relap&s;ed into a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, and having in vain tried various methods to re&s;tore her, he was obliged to call a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Two young wo|men entered, and when &s;he began to revive, he left them to pre|pare her for his re-appearance. When Adeline perceived that the Marquis was gone, and that &s;he was in the care of women, her &s;pirits gradually returned; &s;he looked at her attendants, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o much elegance and beauty.</P>
<P>Some endeavour &s;he made to intere&s;t their pity, but they &s;eemed wholly in&s;en&s;ible to her di&s;tre&s;s, and began to talk of the Marquis in terms of the highe&s;t admiration. They a&s;&s;ured her it would be her own fault if &s;he was not happy and advi&s;ed her to appear &s;o in his pre&s;ence. It was with the utmo&s;t diffi|culty that Adeline forbore to expre&s;s the di&s;dain which was ri&s;|ing to her lips, and that &s;he li&s;tened to their di&s;cour&s;e in &s;ilence. But &s;he &s;aw the inconvenience and fruitle&s;&s;ne&s;s of oppo&s;ition, and &s;he commanded her feelings.</P>
<P>They were thus proceeding in their prai&s;es of the Marquis, when he him&s;elf appeared, and, waving his hand, they imme|diately quitted the apartment. Adeline beheld him with a kind of mute de&s;pair, while he approached and took her hand, which &s;he ha&s;tily with drew, and turning from him with a look of unutterable di&s;tre&s;s, bur&s;t into tears. He was for &s;ome time &s;ilent, and appeared &s;oftened by her angui&s;h. But again ap|proaching, and addre&s;&s;ing her in a gentle voice, he entreated her pardon for the &s;tep, which de&s;pair, and, as he called it, love had prompted. She was too much ab&s;orbed in grief to reply, till he &s;olicited a return of his love, when her &s;orrow yielded to indignation, and &s;he reproached him with his con|duct. He pleaded that he had long loved and &s;ought her up|on honorable terms, and his offer of tho&s;e terms he began to repeat, but, rai&s;ing his eyes towards Adeline, he &s;aw in her looks the contempt which he was con&s;cious he de&s;erved.</P>
<P>For a moment he was confu&s;ed, and &s;eemed to under&s;tand both that his plan was di&s;covered and his per&s;on de&s;pi&s;ed; but &s;oon re&s;uming his u&s;ual command of feature, he again pre&s;&s;ed his &s;uit, and &s;olicited her love. A little reflection &s;hewed
<PB N="145" REF="029379_0073_0FE08BC72A8B6F08">
Adeline the danger of exa&s;perating his pride, by an avowal of the contempt which his pretended offer of marriage excited; and &s;he thought it not improper, upon an occa&s;ion in which the honour and peace of her life was concerned, to yield &s;ome|what to the policy of di&s;&s;imulation. She &s;aw that her only chance of e&s;caping his de&s;igns depended upon delaying them, and &s;he now&punc; wi&s;hed him to believe her ignorant that the Mar|chione&s;s was living, and that his offers were delu&s;ive.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved her pau&s;e, and, in the eagerne&s;s to turn her he|&s;itation to his advantage, renewed his propo&s;al with increa&s;ed vehemence.&mdash;"To morrow &s;hall unite us, lovely Adeline; to morrow you &s;hall con&s;ent to become the Marchione&s;s de Montalt. You will then return my love and"&mdash;</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t fir&s;t de&s;erve my e&s;teem, my Lord."</P>
<P>"I will&mdash;I do de&s;erve it. Are you not now in my power, and do I not forbear to take advantage of your &s;ituation? Do I not make you the mo&s;t honourable propo&s;als?"&mdash;Adeline &s;huddered: "If you wi&s;h I &s;hould e&s;teem you, my Lord, en|deavour if po&s;&s;ible, to make me forget by what means I came into your power; if your views are, indeed honourable, prove them &s;o by relea&s;ing me from my confinement."</P>
<P>"Can you then wi&s;h, lovely Adeline, to fly from him who adores you?" replied the Marquis, with a &s;tudied air of ten|derne&s;s. "Why will you exact &s;o &s;evere a proof of my di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s, a di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s which is not con&s;i&s;tent with love? No, charming Adeline, let me at lea&s;t have the plea&s;ure of be|holding you, till the bonds of the church &s;hall remove every ob|&s;tacle to my love. To morrow."&mdash;</P>
<P>Adeline &s;aw the danger to which &s;he was now expo&s;ed, and interrupted him. "<HI>De&s;erve</HI> my e&s;teem, Sir, and then you will <HI>obtain</HI> it: as a fir&s;t &s;tep towards which, liberate me from a con|finement that obliges me to look on you only with terror and aver&s;ion. How can I believe your profe&s;&s;ions of love, while you &s;hew that you have no intere&s;t in my happine&s;s?" Thus did Adeline, to whom the arts and the practice of di&s;&s;imulation were hitherto equally unknown, conde&s;cend to make u&s;e of them in di&s;gui&s;ing her indignation and contempt. But though the&s;e arts were adopted only for the purpo&s;e of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, &s;he u&s;ed them with reluctance&punc; and almo&s;t with abhorrence; for her mind was habitually impregnated with the love of vir|tue, in thought, word, and action, and, while her end in u&s;ing them was certainly good, &s;he &s;carcely thought that end could ju&s;tify the means.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="029379_0074_0FE08BCC15C3EA28">The Marquis per&s;i&s;ted in his &s;ophi&s;try. "Can you doubt the reality of that love, which, to obtain you, has urged me to ri&s;que your di&s;plea&s;ure? But have I not con&s;ulted your hap|pine&s;s, even in the very conduct which you condemn? I have removed you from a &s;olitary and de&s;olate ruin, to a gay and &s;plendid villa, where every luxury is at your command, and where every per&s;on &s;hall be obedient to your wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>"My fir&s;t wi&s;h is to go hence," &s;aid Adeline; "I entreat, I conjure you, my Lord, no longer to detain me. I am a friend|le&s;s and wretched orphan, expo&s;ed to many evils, and I fear abandoned to misfortune: I do not wi&s;h to be rude; but allow me to &s;ay, that no mi&s;ery can exceed that I &s;hall feel in remain|ing here, or, indeed, in being any where pur&s;ued by the offers you make me!" Adeline had now forgot her policy: tears prevented her from proceeding, and &s;he turned away her face to hide her emotion.</P>
<P>"By Heaven! Adeline, you do me wrong," &s;aid the Mar|quis, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat and &s;eizing her hand; "I love, I adore you; yet you doubt my pa&s;&s;ion, and are in&s;en&s;ible to my vows. Every plea&s;ure po&s;&s;ible to be enjoyed within the&s;e walls you &s;hall partake, but beyond them you &s;hall not go." She di&s;engaged her hand, and in &s;ilent angui&s;h walked to a di&s;tant part of the &s;aloon; deep &s;ighs bur&s;t from her heart, and, almo&s;t fainting, &s;he leaned on a window frame for &s;upport.</P>
<P>The Marquis followed her; "Why thus ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing to be happy?" &s;aid he; "recollect the propo&s;al I have made you, and accept it, while it is yet in your power. To mor|row a prie&s;t &s;hall join our hands&mdash;Surely, being as you are in my power, it mu&s;t be your intere&s;t to con&s;ent to this?" Ade|line could an&s;wer only by tears; &s;he di&s;paired of &s;oftening his heart to pity, and feared to exa&s;perate his pride by di&s;dain. He now led her, and &s;he &s;uffered him, to a &s;eat near the ban|quet, at which he pre&s;&s;ed her to partake of a variety of confec|tionaries, particularly of &s;ome liquors, of which he him&s;elf drank freely: Adeline accepted only of a peach.</P>
<P>And now the Marquis, who interrupted her &s;ilence into a &s;e|cret compliance with his propo&s;al, re&s;umed all his gaiety and &s;pirit, while the long and ardent regards he be&s;towed on Ade|line, overcame her with confu&s;ion and indignation. In the mid&s;t of the banquet, &s;oft mu&s;ic again &s;ounded the mo&s;t tender and impa&s;&s;ioned airs; but its effect on Adeline was now lo&s;t, her mind being too much embarra&s;&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the pre|&s;ence of the Marquis, to admit even the &s;oothings of harmony. A &s;ong was now heard, written with that &s;ort of impotent art&punc;
<PB N="147" REF="029379_0074_0FE08BCC15C3EA28">
by which &s;ome voluptuous poets believe they can at once con|ceal and recommend the principles of vice. Adeline received it with contempt and di&s;plea&s;ure, and the Marquis, perceiving its effect, pre&s;ently made a &s;ign for another compo&s;ition, which adding the force of poetry to the charms of mu&s;ick, might with|draw her mind from the pre&s;ent &s;cene, and enchant it in &s;weet delirium.</P>

<P>When the voice cea&s;ed, a mournful &s;train, played with ex|qui&s;ite expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ounded from a di&s;tant horn; &s;ometimes the notes floated on the air in &s;oft undulations&mdash;now they &s;welled into full and &s;weeping melody, and now died faintly into &s;ilence: when again they ro&s;e and trembled in &s;ounds &s;o &s;weetly tender, as drew tears from Adeline, and exclamations of rapture from the Marquis; he threw his arm round her, and would have pre&s;&s;ed her towards him, but &s;he liberated her&s;elf from his embrace, and with a look, on which was impre&s;&s;ed the firm dignity of virtue, yet touched with &s;orrow, &s;he awed him to forbearance. Con&s;cious of a &s;uperiority, which he was a&s;hamed to acknowledge, and endeavouring to di&s;pi&s;e the influence which he could not re&s;i&s;t, he &s;tood for a moment, the &s;lave of virtue, though the votary of vice. Soon, however, he recov|ered his confidence, and began to plead his love; when Ade|line no longer animated by the &s;pirit &s;he had lately &s;hewn, and &s;inking beneath the languor and fatigue which the various and violent agitations of her mind produced, entreated he would leave her to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The palene&s;s of her countenance, and the tremulous tone of her voice, were too expre&s;&s;ive to be mi&s;under&s;tood; and the Marquis, bidding her remember to morrow, with &s;ome he&s;ita|tion withdrew. The moment &s;he was alone, &s;he yielded to the bur&s;ting angui&s;h of her heart, and was &s;o ab&s;orbed in grief, that it was &s;ometime before &s;he perceived &s;he was in the pre&s;ence of the young women, who had lately attended her, and had en|tered the &s;aloon &s;oon after the Marquis quitted it: they came to conduct her to her chamber. She followed them for &s;ome time in &s;ilence, till prompted by de&s;peration, &s;he again endea|voured to awaken their compa&s;&s;ion; but again the prai&s;es of the Marquis were repeated, and perceiving that all attempts to
<PB N="149" REF="029379_0075_0FE08BD78F32D2C8">
intere&s;t them in her favour were in vain, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them. She &s;ecured the door through which they had departed, and then, in the languid hope of di&s;covering &s;ome means of e&s;cape, &s;he &s;urveyed her chamber. The airy elegance with which it was fitted up, and the luxurious accommodations with which it abounded, &s;eemed de&s;igned to fa&s;cinate the imagination, and to &s;educe the heart. The hangings were of &s;traw coloured &s;ilk, adorned with a variety of land&s;capes and hi&s;torical paintings, the &s;ubject of which partook of the voluptuous character of the owner; the chimney peice, of Parian marble, was ornamented with &s;everal repo&s;ing figures from the antique. The bed was of &s;ilk the colour of the hangings, richly fringed with purple and &s;ilver, and the head made in form of a canopy. The &s;teps, which were placed near the bed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a&s;cending it, were &s;upported by Cupids, apparently of &s;olid &s;ilver, China va&s;es, fill|ed with per&s;ume, &s;tood in &s;everal of the rece&s;&s;es, upon &s;tands of the &s;ame &s;tructure as the toilet, which was magnificent, and or|namented with a variety of trinkets.</P>
<P>Adeline threw a tran&s;ient look upon the&s;e various objects, and proceeded to examine the windows, which de&s;cended to the floor, and opened into belconies towards the garden &s;he had &s;een from the &s;aloon. They were now fa&s;tened, and her efforts to move them were ineffectual; at length &s;he gave up the at|tempt. A door next attracted her notice, which &s;he found was not fa&s;tened; it opened upon a dre&s;&s;ing clo&s;et, to which &s;he de&s;cended by a few &s;teps: two windows appeared, &s;he ha&s;tened towards them; one refu&s;ed to yield, but her heart beat with &s;udden joy when the other opened to her touch.</P>
<P>In the tran&s;port of the moment &s;he forgot that its di&s;tance from the ground might yet deny the e&s;cape &s;he meditated. She returned to lock the door of the clo&s;et, to prevent a &s;urpri&s;e, which, however was unnece&s;&s;ary, that of the bed room being al|ready &s;ecured. She now looked out from the window; the garden lay before her, and &s;he perceived that the window, which de&s;cended to the floor, was &s;o near the ground, that &s;he might jump from it with ea&s;e: almo&s;t in the moment &s;he per|ceived this, &s;he &s;prang forward and alighted &s;afely in an exten|&s;ive garden, re&s;embling more an Engli&s;h plea&s;ure ground, than a &s;eries of French parterres.</P>
<P>Thence &s;he had little doubt of e&s;caping either by &s;ome brok|en fence, or low part of the wall; &s;he tripped lightly along, for hope played round her heart. The clou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the late &s;torm were now di&s;per&s;ed, and the moonlight, which &s;lept on the lawns
<PB N="150" REF="029379_0076_0FE08BDC21FD2C00">
and &s;pangled the flowerets, yet heavy with rain drops, afforded her a di&s;tinct view of the &s;urrounding &s;cenery: &s;he followed the direction of the high wall that adjoined the chateau, till it was concealed from her &s;ight by a thick wilderne&s;s, &s;o entangled with boughs and ob&s;cured by darkne&s;s, that &s;he feared to enter, and turned a&s;ide into a walk on the right; it conducted her to the margin of a lake overhung with lofty trees.</P>
<P>The moonbeams dancing upon the waters that with gentle un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulation playe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> along the &s;hore, exhibited a &s;cene of tranquil beauty, which would have &s;oothed an heart le&s;s agitated than was that of Adeline: &s;he &s;ighed as &s;he tran&s;iently &s;urveyed it, and pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily on in &s;earch of the garden wall, from which &s;he had now &s;trayed a con&s;iderable way. After wandering for &s;ome time, through alleys and over law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; without meeting with any thing like a boundary to the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds, &s;he again found her&s;elf at the lake, and now traver&s;ed its border with the foot|&s;teps of de&s;pair: tears rolled down her cheeks. The &s;cene around exhibited only images of peace and delight; every ob|ject &s;eemed to repo&s;e; not a breath waved the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lage, not a &s;ound &s;tole through the air: it was in her bo&s;om only that tu|mult and di&s;tre&s;s prevailed. She &s;till pur&s;ued the windings of the &s;hore, till an opening in the woods conducted her up a gentle a&s;cent: the path now wound along the &s;ide of a hill, where the gloom was &s;o deep that it was with &s;ome difficulty &s;he found her way: &s;uddenly however, the avenue opened to a lofty grove, and &s;he perceived a light i&s;&s;ue from a rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, and her fir&s;t impul&s;e was to retreat, but li&s;tening and hearing no &s;ound, a faint hope beamed upon her mind, that the per&s;on to whom the light belonged might be one to fa|vour her e&s;cape. She advanced with trembling and cautious &s;teps towards the rece&s;s, that &s;he might &s;ecretly ob&s;erve the per&s;on, before &s;he ventured to enter it. Her emotion increa&s;ed as &s;he approached, and having reached the bower, &s;he, beheld through an open window, the Marquis, reclining on a &s;ofa, near which &s;tood a table covered with fruit and wine. He was alone, and his countenance was flu&s;hed with drinking.</P>
<P>While &s;he gazed, fixed to the &s;pot by terror, he looked up towards the ca&s;ement; the light gleamed full upon her face, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut &s;he &s;tayed not to learn whether he had ob&s;erved her, for, with the &s;wiftne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;ound, &s;he left the place and ran, without knowing whether &s;he was pur&s;ued. Having gone a con&s;iderable wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, fatigue, at length, compelled her to &s;top, and &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the turf, almo&s;t fainting with fear and langour.
<PB N="151" REF="029379_0076_0FE08BDC21FD2C00">
She knew if the Marquis detected her in an attempt to e&s;cape, he would, probably, bur&s;t the bounds which he had hitherto pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf, and that &s;he had the mo&s;t dreadful evils to expect. The palpitations of terror were &s;o &s;trong, that &s;he could with difficulty breathe.</P>
<P>She watched and li&s;tened in trembling expectation, but no form met her eye, no &s;ound her ear, in this &s;tate &s;he remained a con&s;iderable time. She wept, and the tears &s;he &s;hed relieved her oppre&s;&s;ed heart. "O my father!" &s;aid &s;he, "why did you abandon your child? If you knew the dangers to which you have expo&s;ed her, you would, &s;urely, pity and relieve her. Alas! &s;hall I never find a friend; am I de&s;tined &s;till to tru&s;t and be deceiv|ed? &mdash;Peter too, could he be treacherous?" She wept again, and then returned to a &s;en&s;e of her pre&s;ent danger, and to a con|&s;ideration of the means of e&s;caping it; but no means appeared.</P>
<P>To her imagination the grounds were boundle&s;s; &s;he had wandered from lawn to lawn, and from grove to grove, without perceiving any termination to the place; the garden wall &s;he could not find, but &s;he re&s;olved neither to return to the chateau, nor to relinqui&s;h her &s;earch. As &s;he was ri&s;ing to depart &s;he per|ceived a &s;hadow move along at &s;ome di&s;tance; &s;he &s;tood &s;till to ob&s;erve it. It &s;lowly advanced and then di&s;appeared, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ently &s;he &s;aw a per&s;on emerge from the gloom, and approach the &s;pot where &s;he &s;tood. She had no doubt that the Marquis had ob|&s;erved her, and &s;he ran with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to the &s;hade of &s;ome woods on the left. Foot&s;teps pur&s;ued her, and &s;he heard her name repeated, while &s;he in vain endeavoured to quicken her pace.</P>
<P>Suddenly the &s;ound of pur&s;uit turned, and &s;unk away in a different direction: &s;he pau&s;ed to take breath; &s;he looked around and no per&s;on appeared. She now proceeded &s;lowly along the avenue, and had almo&s;t reached its termination, when &s;he &s;aw the &s;ame figure emerge from the woods and dart acro&s;s the av|enue; it in&s;tantly pur&s;ued her and approached. A voice called her, but &s;he was gone beyond its reach, for &s;he had &s;unk &s;en&s;e|le&s;s upon the ground: it was long before &s;he revived, when &s;he did, &s;he &s;ound her&s;elf in the arms of a &s;tranger, and made an ef|for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to di&s;engage her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Fear nothing, lovely Adeline," &s;aid he, "fear nothing: you are in the arms of a friend, who will encounter any hazard for your &s;ake; who will protect you with his life." He pre&s;&s;ed her gently to his heart. "Have you then forgot me?" continued he. She looked earne&s;tly at him, and was now convinced that it was Theodore who &s;poke.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="029379_0077_0FE08BEDC52926D8">Joy was her fir&s;t emotion; but recollecting his former abrupt departure at a time &s;o critical to her &s;afety, and that he was the friend of the Marquis, a thou&s;and mingled &s;en&s;ations &s;trug|gled in her brea&s;t, overwhelmed her with mi&s;tru&s;t, apprehen&s;ion, and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Theodore rai&s;ed her from the ground, and, while he yet &s;up|ported her, "Let us immediately fly from this place&punc;" &s;aid he; "a carriage waits to receive us; it &s;hall go wherever you direct, and convey you to your friends." This la&s;t &s;en|tence touched her heart: "Alas, I have no friends!" &s;aid &s;he, "nor do I know whither to go." Theodore gently pre&s;&s;ed her hand between his&punc; and, in a voice of the &s;ofte&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid, "<HI>My</HI> friends then &s;hall be yours; &s;uffer me to lead you to them. But I am in agony while you remain in this place; let us ha&s;ten to quit it." Adeline was going to reply, when voices were heard among the trees, and Theodore &s;upporting her with his arm, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urried her along the avenue: they continued their flight till Adeline, panting for breath, could go no farther.</P>
<P>Having pau&s;ed a while, and heard no foot&s;teps in pur&s;uit, they renewed their cour&s;e: Theodore knew that they were now not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the garden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all; but he was al&s;o aware, that in the intermediate &s;pace &s;everal paths wound from remote parts of the grounds into the walk he was to pa&s;s, from whence the Marquis's people might i&s;&s;ue and intercept him. He, however, concealed his apprehen&s;ions from Adeline, and endeavoured to &s;ooth and &s;upport her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>At length they reached the wall, and Theodore was leading her towards a low part of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, near which &s;tood the carriage, when again they heard voices in the air. Adeline's &s;pirits and &s;trength were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly exhau&s;ted, but &s;he made a la&s;t effort to proceed, and &s;he now &s;aw the ladder at &s;ome di&s;tance by which Theodore had de&s;cended to the garden&punc; "Exert your|&s;elf yet a little longer," &s;aid he, "and you will be in &s;afety." He held the ladder while &s;he a&s;cended; the top of the wall was broad and level&punc; and Adeline having reached it, remained there till Theodore followed and drew the ladder to the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>When they had de&s;cended, the carriage appeared in waiting, but without the driver. Theodore feared to call, left his voice &s;hould betray him&punc; he, therefore, put Adeline into the carriage, and went him&s;elf in &s;earch of the po&s;tillion, whom he found a&s;leep under a tree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome di&s;tance; having awakened him, they returned to the vehicle, which &s;oon drove furiou&s;ly away.
<PB N="153" REF="029379_0077_0FE08BEDC52926D8">
Adeline did not yet dare to believe her&s;elf &s;afe, but after pro|ceeding a con&s;iderable time without interruption, joy bur&s;t upon her heart, and &s;he thanked her deliverer in terms of the warme&s;t gratitude.

<P>As reflection gradually &s;tole upon her mind, anxiety &s;u|per&s;eded joy; in the tumult of the late moments, &s;he thought only of e&s;cape, but the circum&s;tances of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation now appeared to her, and &s;he became &s;ilent and pen&s;ive: &s;he had no friends to whom &s;he could fly, and was going with a young Chevalier, almo&s;t a &s;tranger to her, &s;he knew not whither. She remembered how often &s;he had been deceived and betrayed where &s;he tru&s;ted mo&s;t, and her &s;pirits &s;unk: &s;he remembered al&s;o the former attention which Theodore had &s;hewn her, and dreaded le&s;t his conduct might be prompted by a &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion.

<P>Adeline &s;aid, "She had been much alarmed by the hints he had given her, and by his failing to afford farther information, concerning the &s;ubject of her danger; and" &mdash;She checked the &s;entence that hung upon her lips, for &s;he perceived that &s;he was unwarily betraying the intere&s;t he held in her heart. There were a few moments of &s;ilence, and neither party &s;eemed per|fectly at ea&s;e. Theodore at length, renewed the conver&s;ation: "Suffer me to acquaint you," &s;aid he, "with the circum&s;tan|ces that withheld me from the interview I &s;olicited; I am anxious to exculpate my&s;elf." Without waiting her reply, he proceeded to inform her, that the Marquis had by &s;ome in|explicable means, learned or &s;u&s;pected the &s;ubject of their la&s;t conver&s;ation, and perceiving his de&s;igns were in danger of being counteracted, had taken effectual means to prevent her obtaining farther intelligence of them. Adeline immediately re|collected
<PB N="154" REF="029379_0078_0FE08BF2B25A4DF8">
that Theodore and her&s;elf had been &s;een in the fore&s;t by La Motte, who had, no doubt, &s;u&s;pected their growing in|timacy, and had taken care to inform the Marquis how likely he was to find a rival in his friend.</P>
<P>"On the day following that, on which I la&s;t &s;aw you," &s;aid Theodore, "the Marquis, who is my colonel, commanded me to prepare to attend in my regiment, and appointed the follow|ing morning for my journey. This &s;udden order gave me &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, but I was not long in doubt concerning the motive for it; a &s;ervant of the Marquis, who had been long attached to me, entered my room &s;oon after I had left his Lord, and ex|pre&s;&s;ing concern at my abrupt departure, dropped &s;ome hints re&s;pecting it, which excited my &s;urpri&s;e. I inquired farther, and was confirmed in the &s;u&s;picions I had for &s;ome time enter|tained of the Marquis's de&s;igns upon you.</P>
<P>"Jacques farther informed me, that our late interview had been noticed and communicated to the Marquis. His informa|tion had been obtained from a fellow &s;ervant&punc; and it alarmed me &s;o much, that I engaged him to &s;end me intelligence from time to time concerning the proceedings of the Marquis. I now looked forward to the evening which would bring me again to your pre&s;ence with increa&s;ed impatience: but the ingenuity of the Marquis effectually counteracted my endeavours and wi&s;hes: he had made an engagement to pa&s;s the day at the villa of a nobleman &s;ome leagues di&s;tant, and notwith&s;tanding all the ex|cu&s;es I could offer, I was obliged to attend him. Thus com|pelled to obey, I pa&s;&s;ed a day of more agitation and anxiety than I had ever before experienced. It was midnight before we returned to the Marquis's chateau. I aro&s;e early in the morn|ing to commence my journey, and re&s;olved to &s;eek an inter|view with you before I left the province.</P>
<P>"When I entered the breakfa&s;t room, I was mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;urpri&s;ed to find the Marquis there already, who commended the beauty of the morning, declared his intention of accompaning me as far as Chineau. Thus unexpectedly deprived of my la&s;t hope, my countenance, I believe expre&s;&s;ed what I felt, for the &s;crutin|izing eye of the Marquis in&s;tantly changed from &s;eeming carele&s;&s;ne&s;s to di&s;plea&s;ure. The di&s;tance from Chineau to the abbey was at lea&s;t twelve leagues; yet I had once &s;ome inten|tion of returning from thence, when the Marquis &s;hould leave me, till I recollected the very remote chance there would even then be of &s;eeing you alone, and al&s;o, that if I was ob&s;erved b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="155" REF="029379_0078_0FE08BF2B25A4DF8">
La Motte, it would awaken all his &s;u&s;picions, and caution him again&s;t any future plan I might &s;ee it expedient to attempt: I therefore, proceeded to join my regiment.</P>
<P>"Jacques &s;ent me frequent accounts of the operations of the Marquis, but his manner of relating them was &s;o very confu&s;ed, that they only &s;erved to perplex and di&s;tre&s;s me. His la&s;t let|ter, however alarmed me &s;o much, that my re&s;idence in quar|ters became intolerable; and as I found it impo&s;&s;ible to obtain leave of ab&s;ence, I &s;ecretly left the regiment, and concealed my&s;elf in a cottage about a mile from the chateau, that I might obtain the earlie&s;t intelligence of the Marquis's plans. Jacques brought me daily information, and, at la&s;t, an account of the horrible plot which was laid for the following night.</P>
<P>"I &s;aw little probability of warning you of your danger. If I ventured near the abbey, La Motte might di&s;cover me, and fru&s;trate every attempt on my part to &s;ave you: yet I deter|mined to encounter this ri&s;k for the chance of &s;eeing you, and towards evening I was preparing to &s;et out for the fore&s;t, when Jacques arrived and informed me, that you was to be brought to the chateau. My plan was thus rendered le&s;s difficult. I learned al&s;o, that the Marquis, by means of tho&s;e refinements in luxury, with which he is but too well acquainted, de&s;igned now that his apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing you was no more, to &s;educe you to his wi&s;hes, and impo&s;e upon you by a fictitious marriage. Hav|ing obtained information concerning the &s;ituation of the room allotted you, I ordered a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hai&s;e to be in waiting, and with a de&s;ign of &s;caling your window, and conducting you thence, I entered the garden at midnight."</P>
<P>Theodore having cea&s;ed to &s;peak, "I know not how words can expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of the obligations I owe you," &s;aid Ade|line, "or my gratitude for your genero&s;ity."</P>
<P>"Ah! call it not genero&s;ity," he replied, "it was love." He pau&s;ed. Adeline was &s;ilent. After &s;ome moments of expre&s;|&s;ive emotion, he re&s;umed; "But pardon this abrupt declaration; yet why do I call it abrupt, &s;ince my actions have already di&s;|clo&s;ed what my lips have never, till this in&s;tant, ventured to acknowledge." He pau&s;ed again, Adeline was &s;till &s;ilent. Yet do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that I am &s;en&s;ible of the impro|priety of pleading my love at pre&s;ent, and have been &s;urpri&s;ed into this confe&s;&s;ion. I promi&s;e al&s;o to forbear from a renewal of the &s;ubject, till you are placed in a &s;ituation, where you may
<PB N="156" REF="029379_0079_0FE08C0064018F50">
freely accept or refu&s;e, the &s;incere regards I offer you. If I could, however, now be certain that I po&s;&s;e&s;s your e&s;teem, it would relieve me from much anxiety."</P>
<P>Adeline felt &s;urpri&s;ed that he &s;hould doubt her e&s;teem for him, after the &s;ignal and generous &s;ervice he had rendered her; but &s;he was not yet acquainted with the timidity of love. "Do you then," &s;aid &s;he in a tremulous voice, "believe me ungrate|ful? It is impo&s;&s;ible I can con&s;ider your friendly interferrence in my behalf without e&s;teeming you." Theodore immediately took her hand and pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips in &s;ilence. They were both too much agitated to conver&s;e and continued to travel for &s;ome miles without exchanging a word.</P>

<P>THE dawn of morning now trembled through the clouds, when the travellers &s;topped at a &s;mall town to change hor&s;es. Theodore entreated Adeline to alight and take &s;ome refre&s;h|ment, and to this &s;he at length con&s;ented. But the people of the inn were not yet up, and it was &s;ome time before the knock|ing and roaring of the po&s;tillion could rou&s;e them.</P>
<P>Having taken &s;ome &s;light refre&s;hment. Theodore and Adeline returned to the carriage. The only &s;ubject upon which Theo|dore could have &s;poke with intere&s;t, delicacy forbade him at this time to notice; and after pointing out &s;ome beautiful &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en|ery on the road, and making other efforts to &s;upport a conver|&s;ation, he relap&s;ed into &s;ilence. His mind though &s;till anxious, was now relieved from the apprehen&s;ion that had long oppre&s;&s;|ed it. When he fir&s;t &s;aw Adeline, her loveline&s;s made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his heart, there was a &s;entiment in her beauty, which his mind immediately acknowledged, and the effect of which, her manners and conver&s;ation had afterwards con|firmed. Her charms appeared to him like tho&s;e &s;ince &s;o finely de&s;cribed by an Engli&s;h poet.</P>

<P>A knowledge of her de&s;titute condition, and of the dangers with which &s;he was environed, had awakened in his heart the tendere&s;t touch of pity, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the change of admiration into love. The di&s;tre&s;s he &s;uffered, when compelled to leave her expo&s;ed to the&s;e dangers, without being able to warn her of them can only be imagined. During his re&s;idence with his regiment&punc; his mind was the con&s;tant prey of terrors, which he &s;aw no means of comba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, but by returning to the neighbour|hood of the abbey, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e might obtain early intelligence of the Marquis's &s;chemes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ready to give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Adeline.</P>
<P>Leave of ab&s;ence he could not reque&s;t, without betraying his de&s;ign where mo&s;t he dreaded it &s;hould be known, and, at length, with a generous ra&s;hne&s;s, which&punc; though it defied law was impelled by virtue, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ecretly qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d his regiment. The progre&s;s of the Marquis's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he had ob&s;erved, with trembling anxiety, till the night tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was to decide the fate of Adeline and him&s;elf rou&s;ed all his mind to action, and involved him in a tumult of hope and fear&mdash;horror and expectation.</P>
<P>Never till the pre&s;ent hour, had he ventured to believe &s;he was in &s;afety. Now the di&s;tance they had gained from the chateau, without perceiving any pur&s;uit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">crea&s;ed his be&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es. It was impo&s;&s;ible he could &s;it by the &s;ide of his beloved Ade|line, and receive a&s;&s;urances of her gratitude and e&s;teem, with|out venturing to hope for her love. He congratulated him&s;elf as her pre&s;erver, and anticipated &s;cenes of happine&s;s when &s;he &s;hould be under the protection of his family. The clouds of mi&s;ery and apprehen&s;ion di&s;appeared from his mind, and left it to the &s;un&s;hine of joy. When a &s;hadow of fear would &s;ome|times return, or when he recollected, with compunction, the circum&s;tances under which he had left his regiment, &s;tationed as it was, upon the frontiers, and in a time of war, he looked at Adeline, and her countenance, with in&s;tantaneous magic&punc; beamed peace upon his heart.</P>
<P>But Adeline had a &s;ubject of anxiety from which Theodore was exempt; the pro&s;pect of her future days was involved in darkne&s;s and uncertainty. Again &s;he was going to claim th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bounty of &s;trangers, again going to encounter the uncertain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their kindne&s;s; expo&s;ed to the hard&s;hips of dependence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="5" REF="029379_0082_0FE08C17DD15C918">
to the difficulty of earning a precarious livelihood. The&s;e anticipations ob&s;cured the joy occa&s;ioned by her e&s;cape, and by the affection which the conduct and avowal of Theodore had exhibited. The delicacy of his behaviour, in forbearing to take advantage of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation to plead his love, in|crea&s;ed her e&s;teem, and flattered her pride.</P>
<P>Adeline was lo&s;t in meditation upon &s;ubjects like the&s;e, when the po&s;tillion &s;topped the carriage; and pointing to part of a road, which wound down the &s;ide of a hill they had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;aid there were &s;everal hor&s;emen in pur&s;uit! Theodore immediately ordered him to proceed with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, and to &s;trike out of the great road into the fir&s;t ob&s;cure way that offered. The po&s;tillion cracked his whip in the air, and &s;et off as if he was flying for life. In the mean while Theodore endeavoured to re-animate Adeline, who was &s;inking with terror, and who now thought, if &s;he could only e&s;cape from the Marquis, &s;he could defy the future.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently they &s;truck in a bye lane, &s;creened and over&s;hadow|ed by thick trees; Theodore again looked from the window, but the clo&s;ing boughs prevented his &s;eeing far enough to de|termine whether the pur&s;uit continued. For his &s;ake Adeline endeavoured to di&s;gui&s;e her emotions. "This lane," &s;aid Theodore, "will certainly lead to a town or village, and then we have nothing to apprehend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, though my &s;ingle arm could not defend you again&s;t the number of our pur&s;uers, I have no doubt of being able to intere&s;t &s;ome of the inhabitants in our behalf."</P>
<P>Adeline appeared to be comforted by the hope this reflection &s;ugge&s;ted, and Theodore again looked back, but the winding<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the road clo&s;ed his view, and the rattling of the wheels over|came every other &s;ound. At length he called to the po&s;tillion to &s;top, and having li&s;tened attentively, without perceiving any &s;ound of hor&s;es, he began to hope they were now in &s;afety. "Do you know where this road leads?" &s;aid he. The po&s;til|lion an&s;wered that he did not, but he &s;aw &s;ome hou&s;es through the trees at a di&s;tance, and believed it led to them. This was mo&s;t welcome intelligence to Theodore who looked forward and perceived the hou&s;es. The po&s;tillion &s;et off, "Fear nothing, my adored Adeline," &s;aid he, "you are now &s;afe; I will part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith you but with life." Adeline &s;ighed, not for her&s;elf only, but for the danger to which Theodore might be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>They had continued to travel in this manner for near half an hour, who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they arrived at a &s;mall village, and &s;oon after &s;top|ped
<PB N="6" REF="029379_0083_0FE08C21E2A742F8">
at an inn, the be&s;t the place afforded. As Theodore lifted Ade|line from the chai&s;e, he again entreated her to di&s;mi&s;s her ap|prehen&s;ions, and &s;poke with a tenderne&s;s, to which &s;he could reply only by a &s;mile that ill concealed her anxiety. After or|dering refre&s;hments, he went out to &s;peak with the landlord, but had &s;carcely left the room, when Adeline ob&s;erved a party of hor&s;emen enter the inn yard, and &s;he had no doubt the&s;e were the per&s;ons from whom they fled. The faces of two of them only were turned towards her, but &s;he thought the figure of one of the others not unlike that of the Marquis.</P>
<P>Her heart was chilled, and for &s;ome moments the powers of rea&s;on for&s;ook her. Her fir&s;t de&s;ign was to &s;eek concealment; but while &s;he con&s;idered the means, one of the hor&s;emen looked up to the window near which &s;he &s;tood, and &s;peaking to his companions, they entered the inn. To quit the room without being ob&s;erved was impo&s;&s;ible; to remain there alone and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|protected as &s;he was, would almo&s;t be equally dangerous. She paced the room in an agony of terror, often &s;ecretly calling on Theodore, and often wondering he did not return. The&s;e were moments of inde&s;cribable &s;uffering. A loud and tumultuous &s;ound of voices now aro&s;e from a di&s;tant part of the hou&s;e, and &s;he &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed the words of the di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tants&punc; "I arre&s;t you in the King's name," &s;aid one, "and bid you, at your peril, attempt to go from hence, except under a guard."</P>
<P>The next minute Adeline heard the voice of Theodore in reply. "I do not mean to di&s;pute the King's orders," &s;aid he, "and give you my word of honour not to go without you; but fir&s;t unhand me, that I may return to that room; I have a friend there whom I wi&s;h to &s;peak with." To this propo&s;al they at fir&s;t objected, con&s;idering it merely as an excu&s;e to obtain an oppor|tunity of e&s;caping; but after much altercation and entreaty, his reque&s;t was granted. He &s;prang forwards towards the room were Adeline remained, and while a &s;erjeant and corporal fol|lowed him to the door, the two &s;oldiers went out into the yard of the inn, to watch the windows of the apartment.</P>
<P>With an eager hand he unclo&s;ed the door, but Adeline ha&s;t|ened not to meet him, for &s;he had fainted almo&s;t at the begin|ning of the di&s;pute. Theodore called loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the mi&s;tre&s;s of the inn &s;oon appeared with her &s;tock of remedies, which were admini&s;tered in vain to Adeline, who remained in|&s;en&s;ible, and by breathing alone gave &s;igns of her exi&s;tence. The di&s;tre&s;s of Theodore was in the mean time heightened by the appearance of the officers, who, laughing at the di&s;covery of his
<PB N="7" REF="029379_0083_0FE08C21E2A742F8">
pretended friend, declared they could wait no longer. Saying this, they would have forced him from the inanimate form of Adeline, over whom he hung in unutterable angui&s;h, when fiercely turning upon them, he drew his &s;word and &s;wore no power on earth &s;hould force him away before the lady recovered.</P>
<P>The men, enraged by the action and the determined air of Theodore, exclaimed, "Do you oppo&s;e the King's orders?" and advanced to &s;eize him, but he pre&s;ented the point of his &s;word, and bid them at their peril approach. One of them im|mediately drew, Theodore kept his guard, but did not advance. "I demand only to wait here, till the lady recovers," &s;aid he; "you under&s;tand the alternative." The man, already exa&s;pe|rated by the oppo&s;ition of Theodore, regarded the latter part of his &s;peech as a threat, and became determined not to give up the point; he pre&s;&s;ed forward, and while his comrade called the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> from the yard, Theodore wounded him &s;lightly in the &s;houlder and received him&s;elf the &s;troke of a &s;abre on his head.</P>
<P>The blood gu&s;hed furiou&s;ly from the wound; Theodore, &s;taggering to a chair, &s;unk into it, ju&s;t as the remainder of the party entered the room, and Adeline unclo&s;ed her eyes to &s;ee him gha&s;tly pale, and covered with blood. She uttered an in|voluntary &s;cream, and exclaiming, "they have murdered him," nearly relap&s;ed. At the &s;ound of her voice he rai&s;ed his head, and &s;miling, held out his hand, to her. "I am not much hurt" &s;aid he, faintly, "and &s;hall &s;oon be better, if indeed you are recovered." She ha&s;tened towards him and gave her hand. "Is nobody gone for a &s;urgeon?" &s;aid &s;he, with a look of agony. "Do not be alarmed," &s;aid Theodore, "I am not &s;o ill as you imagine." The room was now crowded with people, whom the report of the affray had brought together; among the&s;e was a man, who acted as phy&s;ician, apothecary, and &s;urgeon to the vil|lage, and who now &s;tepped forward to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Theodore.</P>
<P>Having examined the wound, he declined giving his opinion, but ordered the patient to be immediately put to bed, to which the officers objected, alleging that it was their duty to carry him to the regiment. "That cannot be done without great danger to his life," replied the doctor; "and"&mdash;"Oh! his life," &s;aid the &s;erjeant; "we have nothing to do with that, we mu&s;t do our duty. Adeline, who had hitherto &s;tood in trembling an|xiety, could now no longer be &s;ilent. "Since the &s;urgeon," &s;aid &s;he, "has declared in his opinion, that this gentleman can|not be removed in his pre&s;ent condition, without endangering his life, you will remember, that if he dies, yours will probably an&s;wer it."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="029379_0084_0FE08C27D57A90D0">"Yes," rejoined the &s;urgeon, who was unwilling to relinqui&s;h his patient, "I declare before the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, that he cannot be removed with &s;afety: you will do well, therefore, to con&s;ider the con&s;equences. He has received a very dangerous wound, which requires the mo&s;t careful treatment, and the event is even then doubtful; but if he travels, a fever may en&s;ue, and the wound will then be mortal." Theodore heard this &s;entence with compo&s;ure, but Adeline could with difficulty conceal the angui&s;h of her heart: &s;he rou&s;ed all her fortitude to &s;uppre&s;s the tears that &s;truggled in her eyes; and though &s;he wi&s;hed to intere&s;t the humanity, or to awaken the fears of the men, in be|half of their unfortunate pri&s;oner, &s;he dared not to tru&s;t her voice with utterance.</P>
<P>From this internal &s;truggle &s;he was relieved by the compa&s;|&s;ion of the people who filled the room, and becoming clamorous in the cau&s;e of Theodore, declared the officers would be guilty of murder if they removed him. "Why he mu&s;t die at any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate," &s;aid the &s;erjeant, "for quitting his po&s;t, and drawing up|on me in the execution of the King's orders." A faint &s;ickne&s;s &s;eized the heart of Adeline, and &s;he leaned for &s;upport again&s;t Theodore's chair, who&s;e concern for him&s;elf was for a while &s;u&s;|pended in his anxiety for her. He &s;upported her with his arms, and forcing a &s;mile, &s;aid in a low voice, which &s;he only could hear, "This is a mi&s;repre&s;entation; I doubt not, when the af|fair is inquired into, it will be &s;ettled without any &s;erious con|&s;equences."</P>
<P>Adeline knew the&s;e words were uttered only to con&s;ole her, and therefore did not give much credit to them, though The|odore continued to give her &s;imilar a&s;&s;urances of his &s;afety. Mean while the mob, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion for him had been gradu|ally excited by the obduracy of the officer, were now rou&s;ed to pity and indignation, by the &s;eeming certainty of his puni&s;h|ment, and the unfeeling manner in which it had been denounced. In a &s;hort time they became &s;o much enraged, that, partly from a dread of farther con&s;equences, and partly from the &s;hame which their charges of cruelty occa&s;ioned, the &s;erjeant con&s;ented that he &s;hould he put to bed, till his commanding officer might di|rect what was to be done. Adeline's joy at this circum&s;tance overcame for a moment the &s;en&s;e of her misfortunes, and of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>She waited in an adjoining room the &s;entence of the &s;urgeon, who was now engaged in examining the wound; and though the accident would in any other circum&s;tances have &s;everely af|flicted
<PB N="9" REF="029379_0084_0FE08C27D57A90D0">
her, &s;he now lamented it the more, becau&s;e &s;he con&s;ider|ed her&s;elf as the cau&s;e of it, and becau&s;e the misfortune, by illu&s;trating more fully the affection of her lover, drew him clo&s;er to her heart, and &s;eemed, therefore, to &s;harpen the poignancy of her affliction. The dreadful a&s;&s;ertion that Theodore, &s;hould he recover, would be puni&s;hed with death, &s;he &s;carcely dared to con&s;ider, but endeavoured to believe that it was no more than a cruel exaggeration of his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon the whole Theodore's pre&s;ent danger, together with the attendant circum&s;tances, awakened all her tenderne&s;s, and di&s;|covered to her the true &s;tate of her affections. The graceful form, the noble, intelligent countenance, and the engaging manners which &s;he had at fir&s;t admired in Theodore, became afterwards more intere&s;ting by that &s;trength of thought, and elegance of &s;entiment, exhibited in his conver&s;ation. His con|duct, &s;ince her e&s;cape, had excited her warme&s;t gratitude, and the danger which he had now encountered in her behalf, called forth her tenderne&s;s, and heightened it into love. The veil was removed from her heart, and &s;he &s;aw for the fir&s;t time, its gen|uine emotions.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon at length came out of Theodore's chamber&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the room where Adeline was waiting to &s;peak with him. She inquired concerning the &s;tate of his wound. "You are a rela|tion of the gentleman's, I pre&s;ume, Madam; his &s;i&s;ter, perhaps." The que&s;tion vexed and embarra&s;&s;ed her, and without an&s;wering it, &s;he repeated her inquiry. Perhaps, Madam, you are more nearly related," pur&s;ued the &s;urgeon, &s;eeming al&s;o to di&s;regard her que&s;tion, "perhaps you are his wife." Adeline blu&s;hed, and was about to reply, but he continued his &s;peech. "The inter|e&s;t you take in his welfare is, at lea&s;t, very flattering, and I would almo&s;t con&s;ent to exchange conditions with him, were I &s;ure of receiving &s;uch tender compa&s;&s;ion from &s;o charming a lady." Saying this, he bowed to the ground. Adeline a&s;&s;uming a very re&s;erved air, &s;aid, Now, Sir, that you have concluded your compliment, you will perhaps, attend to my que&s;tion; I have inquired how you left your patient."</P>
<P>"That, Madam, is, perhaps, a que&s;tion very difficult to be re&s;olved; and it is likewi&s;e a very di&s;agreeable office to pro|nounce ill news&mdash;I fear he will die." The &s;urgeon opened his &s;nuff-box and pre&s;ented it to Adeline. "Die!" &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aimed in a faint voice," "Die!" "Do not be alarmed, Madam," re&s;umed the &s;urgeon, ob&s;erving her grow pale, "do not be alarmed. It is po&s;&s;ible that the wound may not have reached

the&mdash;," he &s;tammered; "in that ca&s;e the&mdash;," &s;tammering again, "is not affected; and if &s;o, the interior membranes of the brain are not touched: in this ca&s;e the wound may, perhaps, e&s;cape inflammation, and the patient may po&s;&s;ibly recover. But if on the other hand,&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I be&s;eech you, Sir, to &s;peak intelligibly," interrupted Adeline, "and not to tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e with my anxiety. Do you really believe him in danger?"</P>
<P>"In danger, Madam," exclaimed the &s;urgeon, "in danger, yes, certainly, in very great danger." Saying this, he walked away with an air of chagrin and di&s;plea&s;ure. Adeline remained for &s;ome moments in the room, in an acce&s;s of &s;orrow, which &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train, and then drying her tears, and endeavouring to compo&s;e her countenance, &s;he went to inquire for the mi&s;tre&s;s of the inn, to whom &s;he &s;ent a waiter. After expecting her in vain for &s;ome time &s;he rang the bell, and &s;ent another me&s;&s;age &s;omewhat more pre&s;&s;ing. Still the ho&s;te&s;s did not appear, and Adeline, at length, went her&s;elf down &s;tairs, where &s;he found her, &s;urrounded by a number of people relat|ing with a loud voice and various ge&s;ticulations, the particulars <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> late accident. Perceiving Adeline, &s;he called out, "Oh! here is Mademoi&s;elle her&s;elf," and the eyes of the a&s;&s;embly were immediately turned upon her. Adeline, whom the crowd prevented from approaching the ho&s;te&s;s, now beckoned her and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> going to withdraw, but the landlady, eager in the pur&s;uit of her &s;tory, di&s;regarded the &s;ignal. In vain did Adeline en|deavour to catch her eye, it glanced every where but upon her, who was unwilling to attract the farther notice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he crowd by calling out.</P>
<P>"It is a great pity, to be &s;ure, that he &s;hould be &s;hot," &s;aid the landlord, "he's &s;uch a hand&s;ome man; but they &s;ay he cer|tainly will if he recovers. Poor Gentleman! he will very likely not &s;uffer though, for the doctor &s;ays he will never go out of this hou&s;e alive." Adeline now &s;poke to a man who &s;tood near, and de&s;iring he would tell the ho&s;te&s;s &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;peak with her, left the place.</P>
<P>In about ten minutes the land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy appeared. Alas! Made|mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;aid &s;he, "your brother is in a &s;ad condition; they fear he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> get over it." Adeline inquired whether there was any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er medical per&s;on in the town than the &s;urgeon whom &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;een. Lord, Madam, this is a rare healthy place; we have little need of <HI>medicine</HI> people here; &s;uch an accident never happened in it before. "The doctor has been here ten years;
<PB N="11" REF="029379_0085_0FE08C3409753808">
but there's very bad encouragement for his trade, and I believe he's poor enough him&s;elf. One of the &s;ort's quite enough for us." Adeline interrupted her to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions concerning Theodore, whom the ho&s;te&s;s had attended to his chamber. She inquired how he had borne the dre&s;&s;ing of the wound, and whe|ther he appeared to be ea&s;ier after the operation; que&s;tions to which the ho&s;te&s;s gave no very &s;atisfactory an&s;wers. She now inquired whether there was any &s;urgeon in the neighbourhood of the town, and was told there was not.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s vi&s;ible in Adeline's countenance &s;eemed to excite the compa&s;&s;ion of the landlady, who now endeavouerd to con|&s;ole her in the be&s;t manner &s;he was able. She advi&s;ed her to &s;end for her friends, and offered to procure a me&s;&s;enger. Ade|line &s;ighed and &s;aid it was unnece&s;&s;ary. "I don't know, Ma'|am&s;elle, what you may think nece&s;&s;ary," continued the ho&s;te&s;s, "but I know I &s;hould think it very hard to die in a &s;trange place with no relations near me, and I dare &s;ay the poor gentle|man thinks &s;o him&s;elf; and, be&s;ides, who is to pay for his fu|neral if he dies!" Adeline begged &s;he would be &s;ilent, and, de|&s;iring that every proper attention might be given, &s;he promi&s;ed her a reward for her trouble, and reque&s;ted pen and ink imme|diately. "Ay, to be &s;ure, Ma'am&s;elle, that is the proper way! why your friends would never forgive you if you did not ac|quaint them; I know it by my&s;elf. And as for taking care of him, he &s;hall have every thing the hou&s;e affords, and I warrant there is never a better inn in the province, though the town is none of the bigge&s;t." Adeline was obliged to repeat her re|que&s;t for pen and ink, before the loquacious ho&s;te&s;s would quit the room.</P>
<P>The thought of &s;ending for Theodore's friends had, in the tumult of the late &s;cenes, never occurred to her, and &s;he was now &s;omewhat con&s;oled by the pro&s;pect of comfort which it opened for him. When the pen and ink were brought, &s;he wrote the following note to Theodore.</P>
<P>"In your pre&s;ent condition, you have need of every comfort that can be procured you, and &s;urely there is no cordial more valuable in illne&s;s, than the pre&s;ence of a friend; &s;uffer me, therefore to acquaint your family with your &s;ituation; it will he a &s;atisfaction to me, and I doubt not a con&s;olation to you."</P>
<P>"In a &s;hort time after &s;he had &s;ent the note, &s;he received a me&s;&s;age from Theodore, entreating mo&s;t re&s;pectfully, but earn|e&s;tly, to &s;ee her for a few minutes. She immediately went to his chamber, and found her wor&s;t appprehen&s;ions confirmed, by

the langour expre&s;&s;ed in his countenance, while the &s;hock &s;he received, together with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r &s;truggle to di&s;gui&s;e her emotions, almo&s;t overcame her. "I thank you for this goodne&s;s," &s;aid he, extending his hand which &s;he received, and &s;itting down by the bed, bur&s;t into a flood of tears. When her agitation had &s;omewhat &s;ub&s;ided, and, removing her handkerchief from her eyes, &s;he again looked on Theodore, a &s;mile of the tendere&s;t love expre&s;&s;ed his &s;en&s;e of the intere&s;t &s;he took in his welfare, and admini&s;tered a temporary relief to her heart.</P>
<P>"Forgive this weakne&s;s," &s;aid &s;he; "my &s;pirits have of late been &s;o variou&s;ly agitated" &mdash;Theodore interrupted her&mdash; "The&s;e tears are mo&s;t flattering to my heart. But, for my &s;ake endeavour to &s;upport your&s;elf: I doubt not I &s;hall &s;oon be bet|ter; the &s;urgeon"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I do not like him," &s;aid Adeline, "but tell me how you find your&s;elf?" He a&s;&s;ured her that he was now much ea&s;ier than he had yet been, and mentioning her kind note, he led to the &s;ubject, on account of which he had &s;olicited to &s;ee her. "My family" &s;aid he, "re&s;ide at a great di&s;tance from hence, and I well know their affection is &s;uch, that, were they informed of my &s;ituation, no con&s;ideration, however rea&s;onable, could pre|vent their coming to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but before they can arri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their pre&s;ence will probably be unnece&s;&s;ary," (Adeline looked earne&s;tly at him) "I &s;hould probably be well," pur&s;ued he, &s;miling "before a letter could reach them; it would, therefore, occa&s;ion them unnece&s;&s;ary pain, and moreover a fruitle&s;s journey. For your &s;ake Adeline I could wi&s;h they were here, but a few days will more fully &s;hew the con&s;equences of my wound: let us wait, at lea&s;t till then, and be directed by circum&s;tances."</P>
<P>Adeline forbore to pre&s;s the &s;ubject farther, and turned to one more immediately intere&s;ting. "I much wi&s;h" &s;aid &s;he, "that you had a more able &s;urgeon; you know the geography of the province better than I do; are we in the neighbourhood of any town likely to afford you other advice?"</P>
<P>"I believe not," &s;aid he, "and this is an affair of little con|&s;equence, for my wound is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that a very mod|erate &s;hare of &s;kill may &s;uffice to cure it. But why my beloved Adeline, do you give way to this anxiety? Why &s;uffer your|&s;elf to be di&s;turbed by this tendency to forebode the wor&s;t? I am willing, perhaps pre&s;umptuou&s;ly &s;o, to attribute it to your kindne&s;s, and &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;ure you that, while it excites my gratitude, it increa&s;es my tendere&s;t e&s;teem. O Adeline! &s;ince you wi&s;h my &s;peedy recovery, let me &s;ee you compo&s;ed; while

<P>As &s;he turned out of the gallery, &s;he met the ho&s;te&s;s, upon whom certain words of Adeline had operated as a tali&s;man, transforming neglect and impertinence into officious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. She came to inquire whether the gentleman above &s;tai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had every thing that he liked, for &s;he was &s;ure it was her endeavour that he &s;hould. "I have got him a nur&s;e, Ma'am&s;elle, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him, and I dare &s;ay &s;he will do very well, but I will look to that, for I &s;hall not mind helping him my&s;elf &s;ometimes&punc; Poor gentleman! how patiently he bears it! One would not think now that he believes he is going to die; yet the doctor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him &s;o him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t as good." Adeline was extremely &s;hocked at this imprudent conduct of the &s;urgeon, and di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed the landlady, after ordering a &s;light dinner.</P>
<P>Towards evening the &s;urgeon again made his appearance, and having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time with his patient, returned to the parlour, according to the de&s;ire of Adeline, to inform her of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> condi|tion. He an&s;wered Adeline's inquiries with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

I don't wonder that you are affected, Madam," &s;aid the &s;urgeon, "the in&s;tance I have related is certainly a very affecting one.

<P>During his narrative, Adeline had been con&s;idering by what means &s;he could di&s;cover the name of the phy&s;ician, for the in|&s;tance that had been produced to prove his <HI>ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and the <HI>infallibility</HI> of his opponent, had completely &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d her opin|ion concerning them both.

<P>She a&s;ked him a few more que&s;tions concerning the &s;tate of Theodore's wound, and was told it was much as it had been, but that &s;ome degree of fever had come on. "But I have or|dered a fire to be made in the room," continued the &s;urgeon, "and &s;ome additional blankets to be laid on the bed; the&s;e, I doubt not, will have a proper effect. In the mean time they mu&s;t be careful to keep from him every kind of liquid, except &s;ome cordial draughts, which I &s;hall &s;end.

<P>"You do not approve then, of the method, which I have &s;omewhere heard of," &s;aid Adeline, "of attending to nature in the&s;e ca&s;es."</P>

<P>Adeline was fatigued by this di&s;cour&s;e, and impatient to im|part to Theodore her di&s;covery of a phy&s;ician, but the &s;urgeon &s;eemed by no means di&s;po&s;ed to leave her, and was expatiating upon various topicks, with new in&s;tances of his &s;urpri&s;ing &s;aga|city, when the waiter brought a me&s;&s;age that &s;ome per&s;on de|&s;ired to &s;ee him. He was however, engaged upon too agreea|ble a topic to be ea&s;ily prevailed upon to quit it, and it was not till after a &s;econd me&s;&s;age was brought that he made his
<PB N="16" REF="029379_0088_0FE08C4D521C4AA0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to Adeline and left the room. The moment he was gone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a note to Theodore&punc; entreating his permi&s;&s;ion to call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>The conceited manners of the &s;urgeon had by this time, gives Theodore a very unfavourable opinion of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lents, and the la&s;t pre&s;cription had &s;o fully confirmed it, that he now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dily con&s;ented to have other advice.</P>
<P>Adeline immediately inquired for a me&s;&s;enger, but recollect|ing that the re&s;idence of the phy&s;ician was &s;till a &s;ecret, &s;he ap|plied to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, who being really ignorant of it, or pretend|ing to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> information. What farther inquiries &s;he made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ineffectual, and &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in extreme di&s;tre&s;s, while the di&s;order of Theodore rather increa&s;|ed than abated.</P>
<P>When &s;upper appeared, &s;he a&s;ked the boy who waited, if he knew a phy&s;ician of the name of Lafance, in the neighbourhood. "Not in the neighbourhood, Madam, but I know Doctor La|fance of Chance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for I come from the town." Adeline inquired farther, and received very &s;atisfactory an&s;wers. But the town was at &s;ome leagues di&s;tance, and the delay this circum&s;tance mu&s;t occa&s;ion, again alarmed her; &s;he, however, ordered a me&s;&s;enger to be immediately di&s;patched, and, having &s;ent again to inquire concerning Theodore, retired to her chamber for the night.</P>
<P>The continued fatigue &s;he had &s;uffered for the la&s;t fourteen hours overcame anxiety, and her harr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed &s;pirits &s;unk to repo&s;e. She &s;lept ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the morning, and was then awakened by the landlady, who came to inform her that Theodore was much wor&s;e, and to inquire what &s;hould be done. Adeline, finding that the phy&s;ician was not arrived, immediately aro&s;e, and ha&s;t|ened to inquire farther concerning Theodore. The ho&s;te&s;s in|formed her, that he had pa&s;&s;ed a very di&s;turbed night&punc; that he had complained of being very hot, and de&s;ired that the fire in his room might be extingui&s;hed; but that the nur&s;e knew her duty too well to obey him, and had &s;trictly followed the doctor's orders.</P>
<P>She added, that he had taken the cordial draughts regularly, but had, notwith&s;tanding, continued to grow wor&s;e, and at la&s;t became light-headed. In the mean time the boy, who had been &s;ent for the phy&s;ician, was &s;till ab&s;ent: "And no wonder," continued the ho&s;te&s;s; "why only con&s;ider, it's eight leagues off, and the lad had to find the road, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad as it is, in the dark. But, indeed, Ma'am&s;elle, you might as well have tru&s;ted our doctor, for we never want any body el&s;e, not we, in the town
<PB N="17" REF="029379_0088_0FE08C4D521C4AA0">
here; and if I might &s;peak my mind, Jacques had better have been &s;ent off for the young gentleman's friends than for this &s;trange doctor that nobody knows."</P>
<P>After a&s;king &s;ome farther que&s;tions concerning Theodore, the an&s;wers to which rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed her alarm; Adeline endeavoured to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in patience the arrival of the phy&s;ician: She was now more &s;en&s;ible than ever of the forlornne&s;s of her own condition, and of the danger of Theodore's, and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed that his friends could be informed of his &s;ituation; a wi&s;h which could not be gratified, for Theodore, who alone could acquaint her with their place of re&s;idence, was deprived of recollection.</P>
<P>When the &s;urgeon arrived and perceived the &s;ituation of his patient, he expre&s;&s;ed no &s;urpri&s;e; but having a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;|tions, and given a few general directions, he went down to Adeline. After paying her his u&s;ual compliments, he &s;uddenly a&s;&s;umed an air of importance, "I aim &s;orry Madam," &s;aid he, "that it is my office to communicate di&s;agreeable intelligence, but I wi&s;h you to be prepared for the event, which, I fear, is approaching." Adeline comprehended his meaning and though &s;he had hitherto given little faith to his judgment, &s;he could not hear him hint at the immediate danger of Theodore with|out yielding to the influence of fear.</P>
<P>She entreated him to acquaint her with all he apprehended; and he then proceeded to &s;ay, that Theodore was, as he had fore&s;een, much wor&s;e this morning than he had been the pre|ceding night; and the di&s;order having now affected his head, there was every rea&s;on to fear it would prove fatal in a few hours. "The wor&s;t con&s;equences may en&s;ue," continued he; "if the wound becomes inflamed, there will be very little chance of his recovery."</P>
<P>Adeline li&s;tened to this &s;entence with a dreadful ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s, and gave no utterance to grief, either by words or tears. "The gentleman, I &s;uppo&s;e, Madam, has friends, and the &s;ooner you inform them of his condition the better. If they re&s;ide at any di&s;tance, it is indeed too late; but there are other nece&s;&s;ary&mdash; you are ill, Madam."</P>
<P>Adeline made an effort to &s;peak, but in vain, and the &s;urgeon now called loudly for a gla&s;s of water; &s;he drank it, and a deep &s;igh that &s;he uttered, &s;eemed &s;omewhat to relieve her op|pre&s;&s;ed heart: tears &s;ucceeded. In the mean time, the &s;urgeon perceiving &s;he was better, though not well enough to li&s;ten to his conver&s;ation, took his leave, and promi&s;ed to return in an

hour. The phy&s;ician was not yet a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and Adeline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ited his appearance with a mixture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and anxio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</P>
<P>About noon he came, and having been info<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">med of the acci|dent by which the fever was produced; and of the treatment which the &s;urgeon had given it&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded to Theodore's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ber: in a quarter of an hour he returned to the room where Adeline expected him. "The gentleman is &s;till delici|ous," &s;aid he, "but I have ordered him a compo&s;ing draught." "Is there any hope, Sir?" inquired Adeline. "Yes, Madam, certainly there is hope; the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent is &s;omewhat doubt|ful, but a few hours may enable me to judge with more certainty. "In the mean time, I have directed that he &s;hall be kept quiet, and be allowed to drink freely of &s;ome diluting liquids."</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely, at Adeline's reque&s;t, recommended a &s;ur|geon, in&s;tead of the one at pre&s;ent employed, when the latter gentleman entered the room, and perceiving the phy&s;ician, threw a glance of mingled &s;urpri&s;e and danger at Adeline, who retired with him to another apartment, where &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with a politene&s;s, which he did not deign to return, and which he certainly did not de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Eearly the following morning the &s;urgeon arrived, but either the medicines, or the cri&s;is of the di&s;order, had thrown Theo|dore into a deep &s;leep, in which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined for &s;everal hours. The phy&s;ician now gave Adeline rea&s;on to hope for a favoura|ble i&s;&s;ue, and every precaution was taken to prevent his being di&s;turbed. He awoke perfectly &s;en&s;ible and face from fever, and his fir&s;t words inquired for Adeline, who &s;oon learned he was out of danger.</P>
<P>In a few days he was &s;ufficiently recovered to be removed from his chamber to a room adjoining, where Adeline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him with a joy, which &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to repre&s;s; and the ob&s;ervance of this lighted up his countenance with plea|&s;ure: indeed Adeline, &s;en&s;ible to the attachment he had &s;o nobly te&s;tified, and &s;oftened by the danger he had e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no longer attempted to di&s;gui&s;e the tenderne&s;s of her e&s;teem, and was at length brought to confe&s;s the intere&s;t his fir&s;t ap|pearance had impre&s;&s;ed upon her heart.</P>
<P>After an hour of affecting conver&s;ation, in which, the happi|ne&s;s of a young and mutual attachment occupied all their minds, and excluded every, idea not in uni&s;on with delight, they re|turned to a &s;en&s;e of their pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ments: Adeline re|collected that Theodore was arre&s;ted for di&s;obedience of orders, and de&s;erting his po&s;t; and Theodore, that he mu&s;t &s;hortly be torn away from Adeline, who would be left expo&s;ed to all the
<PB N="19" REF="029379_0089_0FE08C5C119962E8">
evils from which he had &s;o lately re&s;cued her. This thought overwhelmed his heart again with angui&s;h; and, after a long pau&s;e he ventured to propo&s;e, what his wi&s;hes had often &s;ug|ge&s;ted, a marriage with Adeline before he departed from the village: this was the only means of preventing, perhaps, an eternal &s;eparation; and though he &s;aw the many dangerous in|conveniences to which &s;he would be expo&s;ed, by a marriage with a man circum&s;tanced like him&s;elf, yet tho&s;e appeared &s;o unequal to tho&s;e &s;he would otherwi&s;e be left to encounter alone, that his rea&s;on could no longer &s;cruple to adopt what his af|fection had &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>Adeline was, for &s;ome time, too much agitated to reply; and though &s;he had little to oppo&s;e to the arguments and plead|ings of Theodore; though &s;he had no friends to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, and no contrariety of intere&s;ts to perplex her, &s;he could not bring her|&s;elf to con&s;ent thus ha&s;tily to a mariage with a man, of whom &s;he had little knowledge, and to who&s;e family and connections &s;he had no &s;ort of introduction. At length, &s;he entreated he would drop the &s;ubject, and the conver&s;ation for the remainder of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> day was more general, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;imilarity of ta&s;te and opinion which had at|tracted them every moment now more fully di&s;clo&s;ed.

<P>In the evening, one of the officers, who, upon the repre&s;en|tation of the &s;erjeant, was &s;ent by the per&s;ons employed to pro|&s;ecute military criminals, arrived at the village, and entering the apartment of Theodore, from which Adeline immediate|ly withdrew, informed him, with an air of infinite importance, that he &s;hould &s;et out on the following day for head-quarters. Theodore an&s;wered, that he was not able to bear the journey, and referred him to his phy&s;ician; but the officer, replied that he &s;hould take no &s;uch trouble, it being certain that the phy|&s;ician might be in&s;tructed what to &s;ay, and that he &s;hould be|gin his journey on the morrow. "Here has been delay enough" &s;aid he, "already, and you will have &s;ufficient bu&s;ine&s;s on your
<PB N="20" REF="029379_0090_0FE08C61C2F6B290">
hands when you reach head quarters; for the &s;erjeant whom you have &s;everely wounded, intends to appear again&s;t you; and this, with the offence you have committed by de&s;erting your po&s;t."</P>
<P>Theodore's eyes fla&s;hed fire, "De&s;erting!" &s;aid he, ri&s;ing from his &s;eat, and darting a look of menace at his accu&s;er, "who dares to brand me with the name of de&s;erter?" But in&s;tantly recollecting how much his conduct had appeared to ju&s;tify the accu&s;ation, he endeavoured to &s;tifle his emotions, and with a firm voice and compo&s;ed manner, &s;aid, that when he reached head-quarters, he &s;hould be ready to an&s;wer whatever might be brought again&s;t him, but that till then he &s;hould be &s;ilent. The boldne&s;s of the officer was repre&s;&s;ed by the &s;pirit and dignity with which Theodore &s;poke the&s;e words, and mutter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reply, that was &s;carcely audible, he left the room.</P>
<P>Theodore &s;at mu&s;ing on the danger of his &s;ituation: he knew that he had much to apprehend from the peculiar circum&s;tan|ces attending his abrupt departure from his regiment, it having been &s;tationed in a garri&s;on town upon the Spani&s;h frontiers; where the di&s;cipline was very &s;evere, and from the power of his colonel, the Marquis de Montalt, whom pride and di&s;ap|pointment would now rou&s;e to vengeance, and, probably, ren|der indefatigable in the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;truction. But his thoughts &s;oon led from his own danger to that of Adeline, and, in the con&s;ideration of this, all his fortitude for|&s;ook him: he could not &s;upport the idea of leaving her expo&s;ed to the evils he forboded, nor indeed, of a &s;eparation &s;o &s;udden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that which now threatened him; and when &s;he again entered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> room, he renewed his &s;olicitations for a &s;peedy marriage, with all the arguments that tenderne&s;s and ingenuity could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>Adeline, when &s;he learned that he was to depart on the morrow, felt as if bereaved of her la&s;t comfort. All the hor|rors of his &s;ituation aro&s;e to her mind, and &s;he turned from him in unutterable angui&s;h. Con&s;idering her &s;ilence, as a favourable pre&s;age, he repeated his entreaties that &s;he would con&s;ent to be his, and thus give him a &s;urety that their &s;eparation &s;hould not be eternal. Adeline &s;ighed deeply to the&s;e words: And who can know that our &s;eparation will <HI>not</HI> be eternal," &s;aid &s;he, "even if I could con&s;ent to the marriage you propo&s;e? But while you hear my determination forbear to accu&s;e me of in|difference, for indifference towards you would, indeed, be a crime, after the &s;ervices you have rendered me."</P>
<P>"And is a cold &s;entiment of gratitude all that I mu&s;t ex|pect from you?" &s;aid Theodore, "I know that you are going to di&s;tre&s;s me with a proof of your indifference, which you mi&s;|take
<PB N="21" REF="029379_0090_0FE08C61C2F6B290">
for the &s;ugge&s;tions of prudence; and that I &s;hall be com|pelled to look without reluctance, upon the evils that may &s;hortly await me. Ah, Adeline! if you mean to reject this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">haps, the la&s;t propo&s;al which I can ever make to you, cea&s;e, at lea&s;t, to deceive your&s;elf with an idea that you love me; that delirium is fading even from my mind." Can you then &s;o &s;oon forget our conver&s;ation of this morning?" replied Adeline&punc; "and can you think &s;o lightly of me as to believe I would profe&s;s a regard, which I do not feel? If, indeed, you can be|lieve this, I &s;hall do well to forget that I ever made &s;uch an acknowledgement, and you, that you heard it."</P>
<P>"Forgive me, Adeline, forgive the doubts and incon&s;i&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|cies I have betrayed: let the anxieties of love, and the emer|gencies of my circum&s;tances plead for me. Adeline, &s;miling faintly through her tears, held out her hand, which he &s;eized and pre&s;&s;ed to his lips. "Yet do not drive me to de&s;pair by a rejection of my &s;uit," continued Theodore; "think what I mu&s;t &s;uffer to leave you here de&s;titute of friends and protection."</P>
<P>"I am thinking how I may avoid a &s;ituation &s;o deplorable," &s;aid Adeline. "They &s;ay there is a convent, which recei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> boarders, within a few miles, and thither I wi&s;h to go."</P>
<P>"A convent rejoined Theodore, "would you go to a con|vent? Do you know the per&s;ecutions you would be liable to; and that if the Marquis &s;hould di&s;cover you, there is little prob|ability the &s;uperior would re&s;i&s;t his authority, or, at lea&s;t his bribes?"</P>
<P>"All this I have con&s;idered," &s;aid Adeline, "and am prepared to encounter it, rather than enter into an engagement, which at this time, can be productive only of mi&s;ery to us both."</P>
<P>"Ah, Adeline! could you think thus, if you truly loved? I &s;ee my&s;elf about to be &s;eparated, and that perhaps, for ever, from the object of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tendere&s;t affections&mdash; and I cannot but expre&s;s all the angui&s;h I feel&mdash;I cannot forbear to repeat every argument that may afford even the &s;lighte&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of altering your determination. But <HI>you</HI> Adeline, <HI>you</HI> look with complacency upon a circum&s;tance which tortures <HI>me</HI> with de&s;pair."</P>
<P>Adeline, who had long &s;trove to &s;upport her &s;pirits in his pre&s;ence, while &s;he adhered to a re&s;olution which rea&s;on &s;ug|ge&s;ted, but which the pleadings of her heart powerfully oppo&s;ed, was unable longer to command her di&s;tre&s;s, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>Theodore was in the &s;ame moment convinced of his error, and &s;hocked at the grief he had occa&s;ioned. He drew his chair
<PB N="22" REF="029379_0091_0FE08C7028A51EF0">
toward her, and taking her hand, again entreated her pardon and endeavoured in the tendere&s;t accents to &s;oothe and comfort her.&mdash;"What a wretch was I to cau&s;e you this di&s;tre&s;s, by que&s;tioning that regard with which I can no longer doubt you honour me! Forgive me, Adeline; &s;ay but you forgive me, and whatever may be the pain of this &s;eparation, I will no longer oppo&s;e it."</P>
<P>"You have given me &s;ome pain," &s;aid Adeline "but you have not offen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed me."&mdash;She then mentioned &s;ome farther particulars concerning the convent. Theodore endeavoured to conceal the di&s;tre&s;s which the approaching &s;eparation occa&s;ioned him, and to con&s;ult with her on the&s;e plans with compo&s;ure&punc; His judgment by degrees prevailed over his pa&s;&s;ions, and he now perceived that the plan &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted would afford her the be&s;t chance of &s;ecurity. He con&s;idered, what in the fir&s;t agitation of his mind had e&s;caped him, that he might be condemned up|on the charges brought again&s;t him, and that his death, &s;hould they have been married, would not only deprive her of her pro|tector, but leave her more immediately expo&s;ed to the de&s;igns of the Marquis, who would doubtle&s;s, attend his trial. A&s;toni&s;hed that he had not noticed this before, and &s;hocked at the unwari|ne&s;s by which he might have betrayed her into &s;o dangerous a &s;ituation, he became at once reconciled to the idea of leaving her in a convent. He could have wi&s;hed to place her in the a&s;ylum of his own family, but the circum&s;tances under which &s;he mu&s;t be introduced, were &s;o awkward and painful, and above all, the di&s;tance at which they re&s;ided, would render a journey &s;o highly dangerous for her, that he forbore to propo&s;e it. He entreated only that &s;he would allow him to write to her; but recollecting that his letters might be a means of betraying the place of her re&s;idence to the Marquis, he checked him&s;elf: "I mu&s;t deny my&s;elf even this melancholy plea&s;ure," &s;aid he, "le&s;t my letters &s;hould di&s;cover your abode; yet how &s;hall I be able to endure the impatience and uncertainty to which prudence condems me&punc; if you are in danger, I &s;hall be ignorant of it; though indeed, did I know it," &s;aid he, with a took of de&s;pair, "I could not fly to &s;ave you. O exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery! 'tis now only I percei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the horrors of confinement&mdash;'tis now only that I under|&s;tand all the value of liberty!"</P>
<P>His utterance was interrupted by the violent agitation of his mind; he aro&s;e from his chair, and walked with quick paces about the room. Adeline &s;at, overcome by the de&s;cription which Theodore had given of his approaching &s;ituation, and by
<PB N="23" REF="029379_0091_0FE08C7028A51EF0">
the con&s;ideration that &s;he might remain in the mo&s;t terrible &s;u&s;pen&s;e concerning his fate. She &s;aw him in a pri&s;on&mdash;pale emaciated, and in chains: &s;he &s;aw all the vengeance of the Marquis de&s;cending upon him; and this for his noble exertions in her cau&s;e. Theodore, alarmed by the placid de&s;pair ex|pre&s;&s;ed in her countenance, threw him&s;elf into a chair by her's, and taking her hand, attempted to &s;peak comfort to her, but the words faultered on his lips, and he could only bathe her hand with tears.</P>
<P>This mournful &s;ilence was interrupted by the arrival of a car|riage at the inn, and Theodore ari&s;ing, went to the window that opened into the yard. The darkne&s;s of the night prevented his di&s;tingui&s;hing the objects without, but a light now brought from the hou&s;e &s;hewed him a carriage and four, attended by &s;everal &s;ervants. Pre&s;ently he &s;aw a gentleman, wrapped up in a roquelaure, alight and enter the inn, and in the next mo|ment he heard the voice of the Marquis.</P>
<P>He had flown to &s;upport Adeline, who was &s;inking with ter|ror, when the door opened, and the Marquis, followed by the officers and &s;everal &s;ervants, entered. Fury fla&s;hed from his eyes as they glanced upon Theodore, who hung over Adeline with a look of fearful &s;olicitude&mdash;"Seize that traitor," &s;aid he, turning to the officers; "why have you &s;uffered him to remain here &s;o long?" "I am no traitor'" &s;aid Theodore, with a firm voice, and the dignity of con&s;cious worth, "but a defender of innocence, of one whom the treacherous Marquis de Montalt would de&s;troy."</P>
<P>"Obey your orders," &s;aid the Marquis to the officers. Ade|line &s;hrieked, held fa&s;ter by Theodore's arm, and entreated the men not to part them. "Force only can effect it," &s;aid Theo|dore, as he looked round for &s;ome in&s;trument of defence, but he could &s;ee none, and in the &s;ame moment they &s;urrounded and &s;eized him. "Dread every thing from my vengeance," &s;aid the Marquis to Theodore, as he caught the hand of Ade|line, who had lo&s;t all power of re&s;i&s;tance, and was &s;carcely &s;en|&s;ible of what pa&s;&s;ed; "dread every thing from my vengeance; you know you have de&s;erved it."</P>
<P>"I defy your vengeance," cried Theodore, "and dread only the pangs of con&s;cience, which your power cannot inflict upon m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, though your vices condemn you to its torture."</P>
<P>"Take him in&s;tantly from the room, and &s;ee that he is &s;trongly fettered," &s;aid the Marquis; "he &s;hall &s;oon know what a criminal, who adds in&s;olence to guilt, may &s;uffer."&mdash;

Theodore exclaiming, "Oh Adeline! farewell!" was now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> out of the room; while Adeline, who&s;e torpid &s;en&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were rou&s;ed by his voice and his la&s;t looks, fell at the feet of the Marquis, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of agony, implored compa&s;&s;ion for Theodore: but her pleadings for his rival, &s;erved only to irri|tate the pride, and exa&s;perate the hatred of the Marquis.

<P>The wretched Adeline, who, regardle&s;s of what he &s;aid, &s;till continued to plead for her unhappy lover, was at length alarmed by the returning rage which the countenance of the Marquis expre&s;&s;ed, and, exerting all her remaining &s;trength, &s;he &s;prung from his gra&s;p towards the door of the room; but he &s;eized her hand before &s;he could reach it, and, regardle&s;s of her &s;hrieks, bringing her book to her chair, was going to &s;peak, when voices were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in the pa&s;&s;age, and immediately the landlord and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, whom Adeline's cries had alarmed, entered the apart|ment. The Marquis, turning furiou&s;ly to them&punc; demanded what they wanted; but not waiting for their an&s;wer, he bade them attend him, and quitting the room, &s;he heard the door locked upon her.</P>
<P>Adeline now ran to the windows, which were unfa&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and opened into the inn-yard. All was dark and &s;ilent. She <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed aloud for help, but no per&s;on appeared; and the windo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s were &s;o high, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape una&s;&s;i&s;ted.

<P>She had continued in this &s;tate for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear half an hour, when &s;he &s;uddenly heard a violent noi&s;e in the lower <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the hou&s;e&punc; which increa&s;ed till all was uproar and confu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. People pa&s;&s;ed quickly through the pa&s;&s;ages, and doors were frequently opened and &s;hut. She called, but received no an&s;wer. It immediately occurred to her, that Theodore having heard her &s;creams, had attempted to come to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that the bu&s;tle had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> occa&s;ioned by the oppo&s;ition of the officers.

<P><PB N="25" REF="029379_0092_0FE08C7517EE1558">A confu&s;ed uproar of voices now &s;ounded from below, and the &s;creams of women convinced her there was fighting; &s;he even thought &s;he heard the cla&s;hing of &s;words; the image of Theodore, dying by the hands of the Marquis, now ro&s;e to her imagination, and the terrors of &s;u&s;pen&s;e became almo&s;t in&s;upportable. She made a de&s;perate effort to force the door, and again called for help, but her trembling hands were powerle&s;s, and every per&s;on in the hou&s;e &s;eemed to be too much engaged even to hear her. A loud &s;hriek now pierced her ears, and amid&s;t the tumult that followed, &s;he clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed deep groans. This confirm|ation of her fears deprived her of all her remaining &s;pirits, and growing faint, &s;he &s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s into a chair near the door. The uproar gradually &s;ub&s;ided till all was &s;till, but no|body returned to her. Soon after &s;he heard voices in the yard, but &s;he had no power to walk acro&s;s the room, even to a&s;k the que&s;tion &s;he wi&s;hed, yet feared to have an&s;wered.</P>
<P>About a quarter of an hour elap&s;ed, when the door was un|locked, and the ho&s;te&s;s appeared with a countenance as pale as death. "For God's &s;ake," &s;aid Adeline, "tell me what has happened? Is he wounded? is he killed?"</P>
<P>"He is not dead, Ma'am&s;elle, but&mdash;He is dying then?&mdash;tell me where he is&mdash;let me go."</P>
<P>"Stop Ma'am&s;elle," cried the ho&s;te&s;s, you are to &s;tay here, I only want the hart&s;horn out of that cupboard there." Adeline tried to e&s;cape by the door, but the ho&s;te&s;s pu&s;hing her a&s;ide, locked it, and went down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Adeline's di&s;tre&s;s now entirely overcame her, and &s;he &s;at mo|tionle&s;s, and &s;carcely con&s;cious that &s;he exi&s;ted, till rou&s;ed by a &s;ound of foot&s;teps near the door, which was again opened and three men, whom &s;he knew to be the Marquis's &s;ervants, entered. She had &s;ufficient recollection to repeat the que&s;tions &s;he had a&s;ked the landlady, but they an&s;wered only that &s;he mu&s;t come with them, and that a chai&s;e was waiting for her at the door. Still &s;he urged her que&s;tions. "Tell me if he lives" cried &s;he &mdash; "Yes Ma'am&s;elle he is alive, but he is terribly wounded, and the &s;urgeon is ju&s;t come, to him." As they &s;poke they hurried her along the pa&s;&s;age, and without noticing her entreaties and &s;upplications, to know whether &s;he was going, they had reached the foot of the &s;tairs, when her cries brought &s;everal people to the door. To the&s;e the ho&s;te&s;s related, that the lady was the wife of a gentleman ju&s;t arrived, who had overtaken her in her flight with a gallant; an account which the Marquis's &s;ervants
<PB N="26" REF="029379_0093_0FE08C82A88E5EB8">
corroborated. "'Tis the gentleman who has ju&s;t fought the duel," added the ho&s;te&s;s, "and it was on her account."</P>
<P>Adeline, partly di&s;daining to take any notice of this artful &s;tory, and partly from her de&s;ire to know the particulars of what had happened, contented her&s;elf with repeating her in|quiries; to which one of the &s;pectators at la&s;t replied, that the gentlman was de&s;perately wounded. The Marquis's people would now have hurried her into the chai&s;e, but &s;he &s;unk life|le&s;s in their arms, and her condition &s;o intere&s;ted the humanity of the &s;pectators, that, notwith&s;tanding their belief of what had been &s;aid, they oppo&s;ed the effort made to carry her, &s;en&s;ele&s;s as &s;he was, into the carriage.</P>
<P>She was at length taken into a room, and by proper applica|tions, re&s;tored to her &s;en&s;es. There &s;he &s;o earne&s;tly be&s;ought an explanation of what had happened, the ho&s;te&s;s acquainted her with &s;ome particulars of the late recounter. When the gentle|man that was ill heard your &s;creams, Madam," &s;aid &s;he, "he became quite outrageous, as they tell me, and nothing could pa|cify him. The Marquis, for they &s;ay he is a Marquis but you know be&s;t, was then in the room with my hu&s;band, and I, and when he heard the uproar, he went down to &s;ee what was the matter; and when he came into the room where the Captain was, he found him &s;truggling with the &s;erjeant. Then the Captain was more outrageous than ever, and notwith&s;tanding he had one leg chained, and no &s;word, he contrived to get the &s;erjeants's cutla&s;s out of the &s;cabbard, and immediately flew at the Marquis, and wounded him de&s;perately; upon which he was &s;ecured."&mdash; "It is the Marquis then who is wounded," &s;aid Adeline; "the other gentleman is not hurt."</P>
<P>"No, not he," replied the ho&s;te&s;s; "but he will &s;mart for it by the bye, for the Marquis &s;wears he will do for him." Ade|line, for a moment, forgot all her misfortunes and all her dan|ger in thankfulne&s;s for the immediate e&s;cape of Theodore; and &s;he was proceeding to make &s;ome farther inquires con|cerning him, when the Marquis's &s;ervants entered the room, and declared they could wait no longer. Adeline, now awak|ened to a &s;en&s;e of the evils with which &s;he was threatened, en|deavoured to win the pity of the ho&s;te&s;s, who, however, was, or affected to be, convinced of the truth of the Marquis's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ory, and therefore, in&s;en&s;ible to all &s;he could urge. Again &s;he ad|dre&s;&s;ed his &s;ervants, but in vain; they would neither &s;uffer her to remain longer at the inn, or inform her whither &s;he was go|ing; but in the pre&s;ence of &s;everal per&s;ons, already prejudiced by the injurious a&s;&s;ertions of the ho&s;te&s;s, Adeline was hurri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

into the chai&s;e, and her conductors mounting their hor&s;es, the whole party was very &s;oon beyond the village.</P>
<P>Thus ended Adeline's &s;hare of an adventure, begun with a pro&s;pect not only of &s;ecurity, but of happine&s;s; an adventure, which had attached her more clo&s;ely to Theodore, and &s;hewn him to be more worthy of her love; but which, at the &s;ame time, had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her by new di&s;appointment, produced the impri&s;onment of her generous and now-adored lover, and de|livered both him&s;elf and her into the power of a rival, irritated by delay, contempt, and oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>THE &s;urgeon of the place having examined the Marquis's wound, gave him an immediate opinion upon it, and ordered that he &s;hould be put to bed: but the Marquis, ill as he was, had &s;carcely any other apprehen&s;ion than that of lo&s;ing Adeline, and declared he &s;hould be able to begin his journey in a few hours. With this intention, he had began to give orders for keeping hor&s;es in readine&s;s, when the &s;urgeon per&s;i&s;ting mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly, and even pa&s;&s;ionately to exclaim, that his life would be the &s;acrifice of his ra&s;hne&s;s, he was carried to a bed chamber, where his valet alone was permitted to attend him.</P>
<P>This man, the convenient confidant of all his intrigues, had been the chief in&s;trument in a&s;&s;i&s;ting his de&s;igns concerning Adeline, and was indeed the very per&s;on who had brought her to the Marquis's villa on the borders of the fore&s;t. To him the Marquis gave his farther directions concerning her; and, fore&s;eeing the inconvenience, as well as the danger of de|taining her at the inn, he had ordered him, with &s;everal other &s;ervants, to carry her away immediately in a hired carriage. The valet having gone to execute his orders, the Marquis was left to his own reflections, and to the violence of contending pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The reproaches and continued oppo&s;ition of Theodore, the favoured lover of Adeline, exa&s;perated his pride, and rou&s;ed
<PB N="28" REF="029379_0094_0FE08C8761451AE8">
all his malice. He could not for a moment con&s;ider this op|po&s;ition, which was in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;ucce&s;sful, without feeling an exce&s;s of indignation and inveteracy, &s;uch as the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy revenge could alone enable him to &s;upport.</P>
<P>When he had di&s;covered Adeline's e&s;cape from the villa, his &s;urpri&s;e at fir&s;t equalled his di&s;appointment; and, after exhau&s;t|ing the paroxy&s;ms of his rage upon his dome&s;tics, he di&s;patch|ed them all different ways in pur&s;uit of her, going him&s;elf to the abbey, in the faint hope, that, de&s;titute as &s;he was of other &s;uccour, &s;he might have fled thither. La Motte, however, be|ing as much &s;urpri&s;ed as him&s;elf, and as ignorant of the route which Adeline had taken, he returned to the villa impatient of intelligence, and found &s;ome of his &s;ervants arrived, without any news of Adeline, and tho&s;e who came afterwards were as &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>A few days after, a letter from the Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment informed him, that Theodore had quittted his company, and had been for &s;ome time ab&s;ent, nobody knew where. This information, confirming a &s;u&s;picion which had frequently occurred to him, that Theodore had been by &s;ome means or other, in&s;trumental in the e&s;cape of Adeline, all his other pa&s;&s;ions became for a time &s;ub&s;ervient to his revenge, and he gave orders for the immediate pur&s;uit and apprehen&s;ion of Theodore: but Theodore, in the mean time, had been over|taken and &s;ecured.</P>
<P>It was in con&s;equence of having formerly ob&s;erved the grow|ing partiality between him and Adeline, and of intelligence re|ceived from La Motte, who had noticed their interview in the fore&s;t, that the Marquis had re&s;olved to remove a rival &s;o dan|gerous to his love, and &s;o likely to be informed of his de&s;igns. He had therefore told Theodore, in a manner as plau&s;ible as he could, that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him to join the regiment; a notice which affected him only as it related to Adeline, and which &s;eemed the le&s;s extraordinary, as he had already been at the villa a much longer time than was u&s;ual with the officers invited by the Marquis: Theodore, in|deed, very well knew the character of the Marquis, and had accepted his invitation rather from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unwillingne&s;s to &s;hew any di&s;re&s;pect to his Colonel by a refu&s;al, than from a &s;anguine expectation of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>From the men who had apprehended Theodore, the Marquis received the information, which had enabled him to pur&s;ue and recover Adeline, but, though he had now effected this, he was
<PB N="29" REF="029379_0094_0FE08C8761451AE8">
internally a prey to the corro&s;ive effects of di&s;appointed pa&s;&s;ion and exa&s;perated pride. The angui&s;h of his wound was almo&s;t forgotten in that of his mind, and every pang he felt &s;eemed to increa&s;e his thir&s;t of revenge, and to recoil with new torture upon his heart. While he was in this &s;tate, he heard the voice of the innocent Adeline imploring protection; but her cries excited him neither pity nor remor&s;e; and when, &s;oon after, the carriage drove away, and he was certain both that &s;he was &s;e|cured and Theodore was wretched, he &s;eemed to feel &s;ome ce&s;|&s;ation of mental pain.</P>
<P>Theodore, indeed, did &s;uffer all that a virtuous mind, la|bouring under oppre&s;&s;ion &s;o &s;evere, could feel; but he was, at lea&s;t, free from tho&s;e inveterate and malignant pa&s;&s;ions which tore the bo&s;om of the Marquis, and which inflict upon the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or a puni&s;hment more &s;evere than any they can prompt him to imagine for another. What indignation he might feel to|wards the Marquis was at this time &s;econdary to his anxiety for Adeline. His captivity was painful, as it prevented his &s;eeking a ju&s;t and honourable revenge; but it was dreadful, as it withheld him from attempting the ri&s;que of her whom he loved more than life.</P>
<P>When he heard the wheels of the carriage that contained her drive off, he felt an agony of de&s;pair which almo&s;t overcame his rea&s;on. Even the &s;tern hearts of the &s;oldiers who attended him were not wholly in&s;en&s;ible to his wretchedne&s;s, and by venturing to blame the conduct of the Marquis, they endeavour|ed to con&s;ole their pri&s;oner. The phy&s;ician, who was ju&s;t ar|rived, entered the room during this paroxy&s;m of his di&s;tre&s;s, and both feeling and expre&s;&s;ing much concern at his condition, inquired with &s;trong &s;urpri&s;e why he had been thus precipitately removed to a room &s;o very unfit for his reception?</P>
<P>Theodore explained to him the rea&s;on of this, of the di&s;tre&s;s he &s;uffered, and of the chains by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was di&s;graced; and perceiving the phy&s;ician li&s;tened to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with attention and compa&s;&s;ion, he became de&s;irous of acquainting him with &s;ome farther particulars, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or which purpo&s;e he de&s;ired the &s;oldiers to leave the room. The men, complying with this reque&s;t, &s;ta|tioned them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> out&s;ide of the door.</P>
<P>He then related all the particulars of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tran&s;action, and of his connection with the Marquis. The phy&s;ician attended to his narrative with deep concern, and his countenance frequently expre&s;&s;ed &s;trong agitation. When Theodore concluded, he re|mained for &s;ome time &s;ilent and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in thought; at length,
<PB N="30" REF="029379_0095_0FE08C955E98D708">
awaking from his reverie, he &s;aid, "I fear your &s;ituation is de&s;perate. The character of the Marquis is too well known to &s;uffer him either to be loved or re&s;pected; from &s;uch a man you have nothing to hope, for he has &s;carcely any thing to fear. I wi&s;h it was in my power to &s;erve you, but I &s;ee no po&s;&s;ibility of it."</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid Theodore, "my &s;ituation is indeed de&s;pe|rate, and&mdash;for that &s;uffering angel"&mdash;deep &s;obs interrupted his voice, and the violence of his agitation would not allow him to proceed. The phy&s;ician could only expre&s;s the &s;ym|pathy he felt for his di&s;tre&s;s, and entreat him to be more calm, when a &s;ervant entered the room from the Marquis, who de|&s;ired to &s;ee the phy&s;ician immediately. After &s;ome time he &s;aid he would attend the Marquis, and having endeavoured to attain a degree of compo&s;ure, which he found it difficult to a&s;|&s;ume, he wrung the hand of Theodore and quitted the room, promi&s;ing to return before he left the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He found the Marquis much agitated both in body and mind, and rather more apprehen&s;ive for the con&s;equences of the wound than he had expected. His anxiety for Theodore now &s;ugge&s;ted a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an, by the execution of which he hoped he might be able to &s;erve him. Having felt his patient's pul&s;e, and a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions, he a&s;&s;umed a very &s;erious look, when the Marquis, who watched every turn of his countenance, de&s;ired he would, without he&s;itation, &s;peak his opinion.</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry to alarm you, my Lord, but here is &s;ome rea&s;on for apprehen&s;ion: how long is it &s;ince you received the wound?"</P>
<P>"Good God! there is danger then!" cried the Marquis, adding &s;ome bitter execrations again&s;t Theodore.&mdash;"There certainly <HI>is</HI> danger;" replied the phy&s;ician, "a few hours may enable me to determine its degree."</P>
<P>"A few hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Sir!" interrupted the Marquis; "a few hours!" The phy&s;ician entreated him to be more calm. "Con|fu&s;ion!" cried the Marquis, "A man in health may, with great compo&s;ure, entreat a dying man to be calm. Theodore will be broke upon the wheel for it, howeve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">"</P>
<P>"You mi&s;take me, Sir," &s;aid the phy&s;ician, "if I believe you a dying man, or, indeed, <HI>very</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eath, I &s;hould not have &s;poken as I did. But it is of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;equence I &s;hould know how long the wound has been inflicted." The Marquis's terror now began to &s;ub&s;ide; and he gave a circum&s;tantial account of the affray with Theodore, repre&s;enting that he had been ba&s;ely u&s;ed in an affair, where his own conduct had been perfectly ju&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="029379_0095_0FE08C955E98D708">
and humane. The phy&s;ician heard this relation with great coolne&s;s, and when it concluded, without making any comment upon it, told the Marquis he would pre&s;cribe a medicine, which he wi&s;hed him to take immediately.</P>
<P>The Marquis, again alarmed by the gravity of his manner, entreated he would declare mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly, whether he thought him in immediate danger. The phy&s;ician he&s;itated, and the anxiety of the Marquis increa&s;ed; "It is of con&s;equence," &s;aid he, "that I &s;hould know my exact &s;ituation." The phy&s;ician then &s;aid, that if he had any worldly affairs to &s;ettle, it would be as well to attend to them, for that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what might be the event.</P>
<P>He then turned the di&s;cour&s;e and &s;aid, he had ju&s;t been with the young officer under arre&s;t, who, he hoped, would not be removed at pre&s;ent, as &s;uch a procedure mu&s;t endanger his life. The Marquis uttered a dreadful oath, and, cur&s;ing Theodore for having brought him to his pre&s;ent condition, &s;aid, he &s;hould depart with the guard that very night. Again&s;t the cruelty of this &s;entence, the phy&s;ician ventured t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> expo&s;tulate&punc; and endeavouring to awaken the Marquis to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">man|ity, pleaded earne&s;tly for Theodore.

<P>They &s;eemed to travel through ob&s;cure lanes and bye-ways, along which the carriage drove as furiou&s;ly as the darkne&s;s would permit: when the dawn appeared, &s;he perceived her&s;elf on the borders of a fore&s;t&punc; and renewed her entreaties to know whither &s;he was going. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> man replied, he had no orders to tell, but &s;he would &s;oon &s;ee.

<P>She hinted her &s;u&s;picions to La Motte, who reproved her for having entertained them, but his manner, in&s;tead of repre&s;&s;ing, increa&s;ed her fears for Adeline; fears which, the conduct of the Marquis &s;oon confirmed. On the night that he &s;lept at the abbey, it had occurred to her, that whatever &s;cheme was in agi|tation would now mo&s;t probably be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and anxiety for Adeline, made her &s;toop to a meanne&s;s, which, in other circum&s;tances, would have been de&s;picable. She quitted her room, and, concealing her&s;elf in an apartment adjoining that in which &s;he had left the Marquis and her hu&s;band, li&s;tened to their di&s;cour&s;e. It turned upon the &s;ubject &s;he had expected, and di&s;clo&s;ed to her the full extent of their de&s;igns. Terrified for Adeline, and &s;hocked at the guilty weakne&s;s of La Motte, &s;he was for &s;ometime incapable of thinking, or determining how to proceed.

the Marquis a dreadful puni&s;hment, and knew that if he exa&s;|perated him by refu&s;ing to acquie&s;ce with his wi&s;hes, he had little to expect from flight, for the eye of ju&s;tice and revenge would pur&s;ue him with indefatigable re&s;earch.</P>
<P>La Motte meditated how to break this to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ife, for he perceived that there was no other method of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eracting her virtuous compa&s;&s;ion for Adeline, and the dangerous con&s;e|quences to be expected from it, than by oppo&s;ing it with terror for his &s;afety, and this could be done only by &s;hewing her the full extent of the evils that mu&s;t attend the re&s;entment of the Marquis. Vice had not yet &s;o entirely darkened his con|&s;cience, but that the blu&s;h of &s;hame &s;tained his cheek, and his tongue faltered when he would have told his guilt. At length, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to mention particulars, he told her that, on account of an affair, which no entreaties &s;hould ever induce him to explain, his life was in the power of the Marquis. "You &s;ee the alternative," &s;aid he, "take your choice of evils, and, if you can, tell Adeline of her danger, and &s;acrifice my life to &s;ave her from a &s;ituation, which many would be ambitious to obtain."&mdash;Madame La Motte, condemned to the horrible a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ative of permitting the &s;eduction of inno|cence, or of dooming her hu&s;band to de&s;truction, &s;uffered a di&s;traction of thought&punc; which defied all controul.

<P>At the time when Adeline was planning her e&s;cape from the abbey, the &s;ignificant looks of Peter had led La Motte to &s;u&s;|pect the truth, and to ob&s;erve them more clo&s;ely. He had &s;een them &s;eparate in the hall in apparent confu&s;ion, and had after|wards ob&s;erved them conver&s;ing together in the cloi&s;ters. Circum&s;tances &s;o unu&s;ual left him not a doubt that Adeline had di&s;covered her danger, and was concerting with Peter &s;ome means of e&s;cape. Affecting, therefore, to be informed of the whole affair, he charged Peter with treachery towards him&s;elf, and threatened him with the vengeance of the Marquis if he did not di&s;clo&s;e all he knew. The menace intimidated Peter, and, &s;uppo&s;ing that all chance of a&s;&s;i&s;ting Adeline was gone, he made a circum&s;tantial confe&s;&s;ion, and promi&s;ed to forbear ac|quainting Adeline with the di&s;covery of the &s;cheme. In this promi&s;e he was &s;econded by inclination, for he feared to meet the di&s;plea&s;ure, which Adeline believing he had betrayed her, might expre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="029379_0099_0FE08CBAE0BB8C10">On the evening of the day on which Adeline's intended e&s;cape was di&s;covered, the Marquis de&s;igned to come to the abbey, and it had been agreed that he &s;hould then take Ade|line to his villa. La Motte had immediately perceived the advantage of permitting Adeline to repair, in the belief of being undi&s;covered, to the tomb. It would prevent much di&s;turbance and oppo&s;ition, and &s;pare him&s;elf the pain he mu&s;t feel in her pre&s;ence, when &s;he &s;hould know that he had be|trayed her. A &s;ervant of the Marquis might go, at the ap|pointed hour, to the tomb, and wrapt in the di&s;gui&s;e of night, might take her quietly thence in the character of Peter. Thus, without re&s;i&s;tance, &s;he would be carried to the villa, nor di&s;|cover her mi&s;take till it was too late to prevent its con&s;equence.</P>
<P>When the Marquis did arrive, La Motte, who was not &s;o much intoxicated by the wine he had drank, as to forget his prudence, informed him of what had happened and what he had planned, and the Marquis approving it, his &s;ervant was made acquainted with the &s;ignal, which afterwards betrayed Adeline to his power.</P>
<P>A deep con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the unworthy neutrality &s;he had ob&s;erved in Adeline's concerns, made Madame La Motte an|xiou&s;ly avoid &s;eeing her now that &s;he was again in the abbey. Adeline under&s;tood this conduct, and &s;he rejoiced that &s;he was &s;pared the angui&s;h of meeting her as an enemy, whom &s;he had once con&s;idered as a friend. Several days now pa&s;&s;ed in &s;oli|tude, in mi&s;erable retro&s;pection, and dreadful expectation&punc; The perilous &s;ituation of Theodore was almo&s;t the con&s;tant &s;ubject of her thoughts. Often did &s;he breathe an agonizing wi&s;h for his &s;afety, and often look round the &s;phere of po&s;&s;ibil|ity in &s;earch of hope: but hope had almo&s;t left the horizon of her pro&s;pect, and when it did appear, it &s;prung only from the death of the Marquis, who&s;e vengeance threatened mo&s;t certain de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Marquis, mean while, lay at the inn at Baux, in a &s;tate of very doubtful recovery. The phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon, neither of whom he would di&s;mi&s;s, nor &s;uffer to leave the village, proceeded upon contrary principles, and the good effect of what the one pre&s;cribed, was frequently counteracted by the injudi|cious treatment of the other. Humanity alone prevailed on the phy&s;ician to continue his attendance. The malady of the Marquis was al&s;o heightened by the impatience of his temper, and terrors of death, and the irritation of his pa&s;&s;ions. One moment he believed him&s;elf dying, another he could &s;carcely
<PB N="40" REF="029379_0100_0FE08CC083F1EB10">
be prevented from attempting to follow Adeline to the abbey. So various were the fluctuations of his mind, and &s;o rapid the &s;chemes that &s;ucceeded each other, that his pa&s;&s;ions were in a continual &s;tate of conflict. The phy&s;ician attempted to per|&s;uade him, that his recovery greatly depended upon tranquil|lity, and to prevail upon him to attempt, at lea&s;t, &s;ome com|mand of his feelings, but he was &s;oon &s;ilenced, in hopele&s;s di&s;|gu&s;t by the impatient an&s;wers of the Marquis.</P>
<P>At length the &s;ervant, who had carried off Adeline, return|ed, and the Marquis having ordered him into his chamber, a&s;ked &s;o many que&s;tions in a breath, that the man knew not which to an&s;wer. At length he pulled a folded paper from his pocket, which he &s;aid had been dropped in the chai&s;e by Mademoi&s;elle Adeline, and as he thought his lord&s;hip would like to &s;ee it, he had taken care of it. The Marquis &s;tretch|ed forth his hand with eagerne&s;s and received a note addre&s;&s;ed to Theodore. On perceiving the &s;uper&s;cription, the agitation of jealous rage for a moment overcame him, and he held it to his hand unable to open it.</P>
<P>He, however, broke the &s;eal, and found it to be a note of inquiry, written by Adeline to Theodore during his illne&s;s&punc; and which, from &s;ome accident &s;he had been prevented from &s;end|ing him. The tender &s;olicitude it expre&s;&s;ed f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r his recovery &s;tung the &s;oul of the Marquis, and drew from him a compari&s;on of her feelings on the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s of his rival and that of him&s;elf. "She could be &s;olicitous for his recovery," &s;aid he, "but for mine, &s;he only dreads it." As if willing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g the pain this little billet had exci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, he then r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad it again. Again he cur&s;ed his fate and execrated his rival, giving him&s;elf up, as u&s;ual, to the tran&s;ports of his pa&s;&s;ion. He was going to throw it from him, when his eyes caug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al and he looked earn|e&s;tly at it. His anger &s;eemed now to have &s;ub&s;ided, he depo|&s;ited the note carefully in his pocket book, and was for &s;ome time, lo&s;t in thought.</P>
<P>After many days of hopes and fears, the &s;trength of his con|&s;titution overcame his illne&s;s, and he was well enough to write &s;everal letters, one of which immediately &s;ent off to prepare La Motte for his reception. The &s;ame policy, which had prompted him to conceal his illne&s;s from La Motte, now urged him to &s;ay, what he knew would not happen, that he &s;hould reach the abbey, on the day after his &s;ervant. He repeated this injunction, that Adeline &s;hould be &s;trictly guarded, and renewed his promi&s;es of reward for the future &s;ervices of La Motte.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="029379_0100_0FE08CC083F1EB10">La Motte, to whom each &s;ucceeding day had brought new &s;urpri&s;e and perplexity concerning the ab&s;ence of the Marquis, received this notice with unea&s;ine&s;s, for he had begun to hope that the Marquis had altered his intentions concerning Adeline, being either engaged in &s;ome new adventure, or obliged to vi&s;it his e&s;tates in &s;ome di&s;tant province: he would have been willing thus to have got rid of an affair, which was to reflect &s;o much di&s;honour on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This hope was now vani&s;hed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e directed Madame to prepare for the reception of the Marquis. Adeline pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e days in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, which was now cheered by hope, and now darkened by de&s;pair. This delay &s;o much exceeding her expectation, &s;eemed to prove that the illne&s;s of the Marquis was dangerous; and when &s;he looked forward to the con&s;e|quences of his recovery, &s;he could not be &s;orry that it was &s;o. So odious was the idea of him to her mind, that &s;he would not &s;uffer her lips to pronounce his name, and make the inquiry of Annette, which was of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;equence to her peace.</P>
<P>It was about a week after the receipt of the Marquis's letter, that Adeline one day &s;aw from her window a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of hor&s;e|men enter the avenue, and knew them to be the Marquis and his attendants. She retired from the window in a &s;tate of mind not to be de&s;cribed, and &s;inking into a chair, was for &s;ome time &s;carcely con&s;cious of the objects around her. When &s;he had re|covered from the fir&s;t terror, which his appearance excited, &s;he again tottered to the window; the party was not in &s;ight, but &s;he heard the trampling of hor&s;es, and know that the Marquis had wound round to the great gate of the abbey. She addre&s;|&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven for &s;upport and protection, and her mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g now &s;omewhat compo&s;ed, &s;at down to wait the event.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Motte received the Marquis with expre&s;&s;ions of &s;urpri&s;e at his long ab&s;ence, and the latter, merely &s;aying he had been detained by illne&s;s, proceeded to inquire for Adeline. He was told &s;he was in her chamber, from whence &s;he might be &s;um|moned if he wi&s;hed to &s;ee her. The Marquis he&s;itated, and at length excu&s;ed him&s;elf, but de&s;ired &s;he might be &s;trictly watched.

<P>"Oh by no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns," replied the Marquis; "&s;he intere&s;ts me if po&s;&s;ible more than ever; &s;o much indeed, that I cannot have her too clo&s;ely guarded; and I, therefore, beg La Motte, that you will &s;uffer nobody to attend her, but when you can ob&s;erve

In Motte thought there could be no occa&s;ion for him, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> agreed that the man &s;hould go home.</P>
<P>The Marquis after remaining about half an hour in conver|&s;ation with La Motte, left the abbey, and Adeline &s;aw him de|part with a mixture of &s;urpri&s;e and thankfulne&s;s that almo&s;t overcame her. She had waited in momentary expectation of being &s;ummoned to appear, and had been endeavoring to arm her&s;elf with re&s;olution to &s;upport his pre&s;ence.

This &s;tate of &s;uffering had been prolonged almo&s;t beyond his power of enduring it, when &s;he heard voices under her win|dow, and ri&s;ing, &s;aw the Marquis ride away.

<P>"I would a&s;k," &s;aid &s;he, "after that unfortunate chevalier who has incurred the re&s;entment of the Marquis by endea|vouring to &s;erve me.

<P>"Well, well," &s;aid La Motte, "this young hero, who it &s;eems has been brave enough to lift his arm again&s;t his Colonel, is taken care of, and I doubt not, will &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible of the value of his quixoti&s;m." Indignation, grief, and fear, &s;truggled in the bo&s;om of Adeline; &s;he di&s;dained to give La Motte an opportunity of again pronouncing the name of Theodore; yet the uncertainty under which &s;he laboured, urged her to inquire, whether the Marquis had heard of him &s;ince he left Caux?" "Yes," &s;aid La Motte, "he has been &s;afely carried to his regi|ment, where he is confined till the Marquis can attend to appear again&s;t him."</P>
<P>Adeline had neither power nor inclination to inquire farther, and La Motte quitting the chamber, &s;he was left to the mi&s;ery he had renewed. Though this information contained no new circum&s;tance of misfortune (for &s;he now heard confirmed what &s;he had always expected) a weight of new &s;orrow &s;eemed to fall upon her heart, and &s;he perceived that &s;he had uncon&s;ciou&s;ly cheri&s;hed a latent hope of Theodore's e&s;cape before he reached the place of his de&s;tination. All hope was now, however, gone; he was &s;uffering the mi&s;eries of a pri&s;on, and the tortures of ap|prehen&s;ion both for his own life and her &s;afety. She pictured to her&s;elf the dark damp dungeon where he lay, loaded with chains, and pale with &s;ickne&s;s and grief; &s;he heard him, in a voice that thrilled her heart, call upon her name, and rai&s;e his eyes to Heaven in &s;ilent &s;upplication: &s;he &s;aw the angui&s;h of his countenance, the tears that fell &s;lowly on his cheek, and remembering, at the &s;ame time, the generous conduct that had brought him to this aby&s;s of mi&s;ery, and that it was for her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he &s;uffered, grief re&s;olved it&s;elf into de&s;pair, her tears cea&s;ed to flow, and &s;he &s;unk &s;ilently into a &s;tate of dreadful torpor.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="029379_0102_0FE08CD51987EB50">On the morrow the Marquis arrived, and departed as before.

La Motte, a&s;&s;uring him he was perfectly &s;o, would have conducted him to another room, but the Marquis propo&s;ed a walk in the fore&s;t.

"I mean not to di&s;tre|&s;s you, however; nor is it common curio&s;ity that prompts this in|quiry, but a &s;incere de&s;ire to befriend you.

<P>"You have perhaps, been ill u&s;ed, re&s;umed he.&mdash;Yes, Sir, I am ruined, and therefore, it may be &s;aid, I am ill u&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Do you know the people you have played with?</P>
<P>"No; but I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t them in the fir&s;t circles.</P>
<P>"Then I am, probably, mi&s;taken, &s;aid he, and walked away. His la&s;t words rou&s;ed me, and rai&s;ed a hope that my money had not been fairly lo&s;t. Wi&s;hing for farther information, I went in &s;earch of the gentleman, but he had left the rooms; I, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> returned to the table where I had lo&s;t my money, placed my&s;elf behind the chair of one of the per|&s;ons who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&punc; and clo&s;ely watched the game. For &s;ome time I &s;aw nothing that could confirm my &s;u&s;picions, but was at length convinced they were ju&s;t.</P>
<P>"When the game was ended I called one of my adver&s;aries out of the room, and telling him what I had ob&s;erved, threatened in&s;tantly to expo&s;e him if he did not re&s;tore my property. The man was for &s;ome time, as po&s;itive as my&s;elf; and a&s;&s;uming the bul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, threatened me with cha&s;ti&s;ement for my &s;candalous a&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.

&s;ufficiently inflamed by misfortune. After retorting his threats, I was about to return to the apartment we had left, and expo&s;e what had pa&s;&s;ed, when, with an in&s;idious &s;mile, and a &s;oftened voice, he begged I would favour him with a few moments atten|tion, and allow him to &s;peak with the gentleman his partner. To the latter part of his reque&s;t I he&s;itated, but, in the mean time, the gentleman him&s;elf entered the room. His partner re|lated to him in few words, what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, and the terror that appeared in his countenance &s;ufficiently declared his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt.</P>
<P>"The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen drew a&s;ide, and remained a few minutes in con|ver&s;ation together, after which, they approached me with an of|fer, as they phra&s;ed it, of a compromi&s;e. I declared, however, again&s;t any thing of this kind, and &s;wore, nothing le&s;s than the whole &s;um I had lo&s;t &s;hould content me. Is it not po&s;&s;ible Mon|&s;ieur, that you may be offered &s;omething as advantageous as the whole? &mdash;I did not under&s;tand their meaning, but after they had continued for &s;ome time to give di&s;tant hints of the &s;ame &s;ort, they proceeded to explain.</P>
<P>"Perceiving their characters wholly in my power, they wi&s;hed to &s;ecure my intere&s;t to their party, and therefore, informing me, that they belonged to an a&s;&s;ociation of per&s;ons, who lived upon the folly and inexperience of others, they offered me a &s;hare in their concern. My fortunes were de&s;perate, and the propo&s;al now made me, would not only produce an immediate &s;upply, but enable me to return to tho&s;e &s;cenes of di&s;&s;ipated plea&s;ure, to which pa&s;&s;ion had at fir&s;t, and long habit afterwards attached me. I clo&s;ed with the offer, and thus &s;unk from di&s;&s;i|pation into infamy."</P>
<P>La Motte pau&s;ed, as if the recollection of the&s;e times filled him with remor&s;e. The Marquis under&s;tood his feelings. "You judge too rigorou&s;ly of your&s;elf," &s;aid he; "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here are few per&s;ons, let their appearance of hone&s;ty be what it may, who, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, would have acted better than you have done. Had I been in your &s;ituation, I know not how I might have acted. That rigid virtue which &s;hall condemn you, may dignify it&s;elf with the appellation of wi&s;dom, but I wi&s;h not to po&s;&s;e&s;s it: let it &s;till re&s;ide, where it generally is to be found, in the cold bo&s;oms of tho&s;e, who wanting feeling to be men, dignify them&s;elves with the title of philo&s;ophers. But pray proceed."</P>
<P>"Our &s;ucce&s;s was for &s;ome time unlimited, for we held th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wheel of fortune, and tru&s;ted not to her caprice.

my income. An unlucky di&s;covery of the practices of our party was at length made by a young nobleman, which obliged us to act for &s;ome time with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection. It would be tedious to relate the particulars, which made us at length &s;o &s;u&s;pected, that the di&s;tant civility and cold re&s;erve of our ac|quaintance rendered the frequenting public a&s;&s;emblies both painful and unprofitable. We turned our thoughts to other modes of obtaining money, and a &s;windling tran&s;action, in which I engaged, to a very large amount, &s;oon compelled me to leave Paris. You know the re&s;t, my Lord."</P>
<P>La Motte was now &s;ilent, and the Marquis continued for &s;ome time mu&s;ing. "You perceived, my Lord," at length re&s;umed La Motte, "you perceive that my ca&s;e is hopele&s;s."</P>
<P>"It is bad, indeed, but not entirely hopele&s;s. From my &s;oul I pity you. Yet if you &s;hould return to the world, and incur the danger of pro&s;ecution, I think my intere&s;t with the Mini&s;|ter might &s;ave you from any &s;evere puni&s;hment. You &s;eem however, to have lo&s;t your reli&s;h for &s;ociety, and perhaps, do not wi&s;h to return to it."</P>
<P>"Oh! my Lord can you doubt this?&mdash;But I am over|come with the exce&s;s of your goodne&s;s; would to Heaven it were in my power to prove the gratitude it in&s;pires."</P>
<P>"Talk not of goodne&s;s," &s;aid the Marquis; "I will not pretend that my de&s;ire of &s;erving you is unalloyed by any degree of &s;elf intere&s;t. I will not affect to be more than man, and tru&s;t me tho&s;e who do are le&s;s. It is in your power to te&s;tify your gratitude: and bind me to your intere&s;t for ever." He pau&s;ed. "Name but the means," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> La Motte, "name but the means, and if they are within the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of po&s;&s;ibility they &s;hall be executed." The Marquis w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ilent. "Do you doubt my &s;incerity, my Lord, that you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> yet &s;ilent? Do you fear to repo&s;e a confidence in the man whom you have already loaded with obligation? who lives by your mercy, and almo&s;t by your means." The Marquis looked earne&s;tly at him, but did not &s;peak. "I have not de&s;erved this of you; my Lord; &s;peak, I entreat you."</P>
<P>"There are certain prejudices attached to the human mind," &s;aid the Marquis in a &s;low and &s;olemn voice, "which it requires all our wi&s;dom to keep from interfering with our happine&s;s; certain &s;et notions, acquired in infancy, and cheri&s;hed involun|tarily by age, which grow up and a&s;&s;ume a glo&s;s &s;o plau&s;ible, that few minds, in what is called a civilized country can afterwards overcome them.

The Marquis pau&s;ed, and La Motte continued to li&s;ten eager expectation.</P>
<P>"Nature, uncontaminated by fal&s;e refinement," re&s;umed the Marquis, "every where acts alike in the great occurrences of life. The Indian di&s;covers his friend to be perfidious and he kills him; the wild A&s;iatic does the &s;ame; the Turk, when ambi|tion fires, or revenge provokes, gratifies his pa&s;&s;ion at the ex|pen&s;e of life, and does not call it murder. Even the poli&s;hed Italian, di&s;tracted by jealou&s;y, or tempted by a &s;trong circum|&s;tance of advantage, draws his &s;tilletto, and accompli&s;hes his pur|po&s;e. It is the fir&s;t proof of a &s;uperior mind to liberate it&s;elf from prejudices of country, or of education. You are &s;ilent La Motte; are you not of my opinion?"</P>
<P>"I am attending, my Lord, to your <HI>rea&s;oning.</HI>"</P>
<P>"There are, I repeat it," &s;aid the Marquis, "people of minds &s;o weak, as to &s;hrink from acts they have been accu&s;tomed to hold wrong, however advantageous. They never &s;uffer them|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lves to be guided by circum&s;tances, but fix for life upon a cer|tain &s;tandard, from which they will, on no account, depart.

<P>"Explain your&s;elf, my Lord."</P>
<P>"Kind &s;ervices that&mdash;in &s;hort there are &s;ervices, which excite all our gratitude, and which we can never think repaid. It is in your power to place me in &s;uch a &s;ituation."</P>

<P>"My Lord, you may tru&s;t me in any thing; explain your|&s;elf more fully."</P>
<P>"What &s;ecurity will you give me for your faithfulne&s;s?"</P>
<P>"My life my Lord; is it not already in your power?" The Marquis he&s;itated, and then &s;aid, "To-morrow, about this time, I &s;hall return to the abbey, and will then explain my meaning, if, indeed, you &s;hall not already have under&s;tood it. You, in the mean time, will con&s;ider your own powers of re&s;olu|tion, and be prepared either to adopt the purpo&s;e I &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t, or to declare you will not." La Motte made &s;ome confu&s;ed reply. "Farewell till to-morrow," &s;aid the Marquis; "re|member that freedom and affluence are now before you." He moved towards the abbey, and mounting his hor&s;e, rode off with his attendants. La Motte walked &s;lowly home, mu&s;ing on the late conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>THE Marquis was punctual to the hour, La Motte received him at the gate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t he declined entering, and &s;aid he preferred a walk in the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.

<P>"I have my Lord, and will quickly decide, when you &s;hall farther explain your&s;elf. Till then I can form no re&s;olution." The Marquis appeared di&s;atisfied, and was a moment &s;ilent. "Is it

then po&s;&s;ible," he at length re&s;umed, "that you do not under&s;tand? This ignorance is &s;urely affected. La Motte I expect &s;incerity. Tell me, therefore, is it nece&s;&s;ary&punc; I &s;hould &s;ay more.</P>
<P>"It is, my Lord," &s;aid La Motte immediately. "If you fear to con&s;ide in me freely, how can I fully accompli&s;h your purpo&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Before I proceed farther," &s;aid the Marquis, "let me ad|mini&s;ter &s;ome oath which &s;hall bind you to &s;ecrecy. But this is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary; for, could I even doubt your word of honour, the remembrance of a certain tran&s;action would point out to you the nece&s;&s;ity of being as &s;ilent your&s;elf as you mu&s;t wi&s;h me to be. There was now a pau&s;e of &s;ilence, during which both the Marquis and La Motte betrayed &s;ome confu|&s;ion. I think, La Motte," &s;aid he, "I have given you &s;uf|ficient proof that I can be grateful: the &s;ervices you have al|ready rendered me with re&s;pect to Adeline have not been un|rewarded."</P>
<P>"True my Lord, I am ever willing to acknowledge this, and am &s;orry it has not been in my power to &s;erve you more effectu|ally. Your farther views re&s;pecting her I am ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t."</P>
<P>"I thank you&mdash;Adeline"&mdash;the Marquis he&s;itated&mdash; "Adeline" rejoined La Motte, eager to anticipate his wi&s;hes, "has beauty worthy of your pur&s;uit.

<P>"Yes, yes," interrupted the Marquis; but"&mdash;he pau&s;ed&mdash; "But they have given you too much trouble in the pur&s;uit," &s;aid La Motte; "and to be &s;ure, my Lord, it mu&s;t be confe&s;|&s;ed they have; but this trouble is all over&mdash;you may now con&s;ider her as your own.</P>
<P>"I would do &s;o," &s;aid the Marquis, fixing an eye of earne&s;t regard upon La Motte&mdash;"I would do &s;o."</P>
<P>"Name your hour, my Lord; you &s;hall not be interrupted.&mdash; Beauty &s;uch as Adeline's"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Watch her clo&s;e" interrupted the Marquis, "and on no account &s;uffer her to leave her apartment. Where is &s;he now?"</P>
<P>"Confined in her chamber."</P>
<P>"Very well. But I am impatient."</P>
<P>"Name your time, my Lord&mdash;to-morrow night"</P>
<P><HI>To-morrow</HI> night," &s;aid the Marquis&mdash;to-morrow night. Do you under&s;tand me now?"</P>
<P>"Yes, my Lord, this night, if you wi&s;h it &s;o. But had you not better di&s;mi&s;s your &s;ervants, and remain your&s;elf in the fore&s;t. You know the door that opens upon the wood from

<P>"Adeline dies!" interrupted the Marquis, in a low voice &s;carcely human. "Do you under&s;tand me now?"&mdash;La Motte &s;hrunk agha&s;t&mdash;"My Lord!"</P>
<P>"La Motte" &s;aid the Marquis,&mdash;There was a &s;ilence of &s;everal minutes, in which La Motte endeavoured to recover him&s;elf.&mdash;"Let me a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, my Lord, the meaning of this?" &s;aid he, when he had breath to &s;peak. "Why &s;hould you wi&s;h the death of Adeline&mdash;of Adeline whom &s;o lately you loved?"</P>
<P>"Make no inquiries for my motive," &s;aid the Marquis; but it is as certain as that I live that &s;he you name mu&s;t die. "This is &s;ufficient." The &s;urpri&s;e of La Motte equalled his horror the means are various," re&s;umed the Marquis. "I could have wi&s;hed that no blood might be &s;pilt; and there are drugs &s;ure and &s;peedy in their effect, but they cannot be &s;oon or &s;afely procured. I al&s;o wi&s;h it over&mdash;it mu&s;t be done quickly, this night."</P>
<P>"This night, my Lord!"</P>
<P>"Aye, this night, La Motte; if it is to be, why not &s;oon. Have you no convenient drug at hand?"</P>
<P>"None, my Lord."</P>
<P>"I feared to tru&s;t a third per&s;on, or I &s;hould have been pro|vided," &s;aid the Marquis. "As it is, take this poignard; u&s;e it as occa&s;ion offers, but be re&s;olute." La Motte received the poignard with a trembling hand, and continued to gaze upon it for &s;ome time, &s;carcely knowing what he did. "Put it up," &s;aid the Marquis, "and endeavour to recollect your&s;elf." La Motte obeyed, but continued to mu&s;e in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>He &s;aw him&s;elf entangled in the web which his own crimes had woven. Being in the power of the Marquis, he knew he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t either con&s;ent to the commi&s;&s;ion to a deed, from the enor|mity of which, depraved as he was, he &s;hrunk in horror, or &s;ac|rifice fortune, freedom, probably life it&s;elf, to the refu&s;al. He had been led on by &s;low gradations from folly to vice, till he now &s;aw before him an aby&s;s of guilt which &s;tartled even the con&s;cience that &s;o long had &s;lumbered.

<P>When he con&s;idered the innocence, and the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of Adeline, her orphan &s;tate, her former affectionate conduct, and her confidence in his protection, his heart melted with compa&s;|&s;ion for the di&s;tre&s;s he had already occa&s;ioned her, and &s;hrunk in

arrange her thoughts, and to argue her&s;elf into &s;ome degree of re&s;ignation; but reflection, by repre&s;enting the pa&s;t, and rea|&s;on, by anticipating the future, brought before her mind the full picture of her misfortunes, and &s;he &s;unk in de&s;pondency. Of Theodore, who, by a conduct &s;o noble, had te&s;tified his attachment and involved him&s;elf in ruin, &s;he thought with a degree of angui&s;h infinitely &s;uperior to any &s;he had felt upon my other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>That the very exertions which had de&s;erved all her gratitude, and awakened all her tenderne&s;s, &s;hould be the cau&s;e of his de&s;truction, was a circum&s;tance &s;o much beyond the ordinary bounds of mi&s;ery, that her fortitude &s;unk at once before it. The idea of Theodore &s;uffering&mdash;Theodore dying&mdash;was for ever pre&s;ent to her imagination, and frequently excluding the &s;en&s;e of her own danger, made her con&s;cious only of his. Sometimes the hope he had given her of being able to vindi|cate his conduct, or at lea&s;t to obtain a pardon, would return; but it was like the faint beam of an April morn, tran&s;ient and cheerle&s;s. She knew that the Marquis, &s;tung with jealou&s;y, and exa&s;perated to revenge, would pur&s;ue him with unrelenting malice.</P>
<P>Again&s;t &s;uch an enemy what could Theodore oppo&s;e? Con|&s;cious rectitude would not avail him to ward off the blow which di&s;appointed pa&s;&s;ion and powerful pride directed. Her di&s;tre&s;s was con&s;iderably heightened by reflecting that no intelligence of him could reach her at the Abbey, and that &s;he mu&s;t remain &s;he knew not how long in the mo&s;t dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e concern|ing his fate. From the Abbey &s;he &s;aw no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cap|ing. She was a pri&s;oner in a chamber inclo&s;ed at every avenue: &s;he had no opportunity of conver&s;ing with any per&s;on who could afford her even a chance of relief; and &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf condemn|ed to await in pa&s;&s;ive &s;ilence the impending de&s;tiny, infinitely more dreadful to her imagination than death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus circum&s;tanced, &s;he yielded to the pre&s;&s;ure of her mis|fortunes, and would &s;it for hours motionle&s;s and given up to thought. "Theodore!" &s;he would frequently exclaim, you cannot hear my voice, you cannot fly to help me; your&s;elf a pri&s;oner and in chains." The picture was too horrid. The &s;welling angui&s;h of her heart would &s;ubdue her utterance&mdash;tears bathed her cheeks&mdash;and &s;he became in&s;en&s;ible to every thing but the mi&s;ery of Theodore.</P>
<P>On this evening her mind had been remarkably tranquil; and as &s;he watched from her window, with a &s;till and melancholy plea&s;ure the &s;etting &s;un, the fading &s;plendor of the we&s;tern ho|rizon,

and the gradual approach of twilight, her thoughts bore her back to the time when, in happier circum&s;tances, &s;he had watched the &s;ame appearances. She recollected al&s;o the evening of her temporary e&s;cape from the abbey, when from this &s;ame window &s;he had viewed the declining &s;un&mdash;how anxiou&s;ly &s;he had awaited the fall of twilight&mdash;how much &s;he had endea|voured to anticipate the events of her future life&mdash;with what trembling fear &s;he had de&s;cended from the tower and ventured into the fore&s;t. The&s;e reflections produced others that filled her heart with angui&s;h and her eyes with tears.</P>
<P>While &s;he was lo&s;t in her melancholy reverie, &s;he &s;aw the Marquis mount his hor&s;e, and depart from the gates. The &s;ight of him revived, in all its force, a &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;ery he inflicted on her beloved Theodore, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the evils which more immediately threatened her&s;elf. She with|drew from the window in an agony of tears, which continuing for a con&s;iderable time, her frame was at length, quite exhau&s;ted&punc; and &s;he retired early to re&s;t.</P>
<P>La Motte remained in his chamber till &s;upper obliged hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to de&s;cend. At table his wild and haggered countenance&punc; which in &s;pite of all his endeavours, betrayed the di&s;order of his mind, and his long and frequent &s;its of ab&s;traction &s;urpri&s;ed as well as alarmed Madame La Motte. When Peter left the room &s;he tenderly inquired what had di&s;turbed him, and he with a di&s;torted &s;mile, tried to be gay, but the effort was beyond his art, and he quickly relap&s;ed into &s;ilence; or when Madame La Motte &s;poke, and he &s;trove to conceal the ab&s;ence of his thoughts, he an&s;wered &s;o entirely from the purpo&s;e, that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;traction became &s;till more apparent. Ob&s;erving this, Madame La Motte appeared to take no notice of his pre&s;ent temper; and they continued to fit in uninterrupted &s;ilence till the hour of re&s;t, when they retired to their chamber.</P>
<P>La Motte lay in a &s;tate of di&s;turbed watchfulne&s;s for &s;ome time, and his frequent &s;tarts awoke Madame, who, however, being pacified by &s;ome trifling excu&s;e, &s;oon went to &s;leep again. This agitation continued till near midnight, when recollec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that the time was now pa&s;&s;ing in idle reflection which ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be devoted to action, he &s;tole &s;ilently from his bed, wrapped him&s;elf in his night gown, and, taking the lamp which bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nightly in his chamber, pa&s;&s;ed up the &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e.

When he approached the bed he heard her gently breathe, and &s;oon after &s;igh&mdash;and he &s;topped; but &s;ilence returning, he again advanced, and then heard her &s;ing in her &s;leep. As he li&s;tened he di&s;tingu&s;hed &s;ome notes of a melancholy little air which, in her happier days, &s;he had often &s;ung to him. The low and mournful accent in which &s;he now uttered them expre&s;&s;ed too well the tone of her mind.</P>
<P>La Motte now &s;tepped ha&s;tily towards the bed, when, breath|ing a deep &s;igh, &s;he was again &s;ilent. He undrew the curtain, and &s;aw her lying in a profound &s;leep, her cheek yet wet with tears, re&s;ting upon her arm. He &s;tood a moment looking at her; and as he viewed her innocent and lovely countenance, pale in grief, the light of the lamp, which &s;hone &s;trong upon her eyes, awoke her, and, perceiving a man, &s;he uttered a &s;cream. Her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecollection returning, &s;he knew him to be La Motte, and it in&s;tantly recurring to her that the Marquis was at hand, &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf in bed, and implored pity and protection. La Motte &s;tood looking eagerly at her, but without replying.</P>
<P>The wildne&s;s of his looks, and the gloomy &s;ilence he pre&s;erved increa&s;ed her alarm, and with tears of terror &s;he renewed her &s;upplication. "You once &s;aved me from de&s;truction," cried &s;he; "O &s;ave me now! Have pity upon me&mdash;I have no pro|tector but you."</P>
<P>"What is it you fear?" &s;aid La Motte in a tone &s;carcely articulate.&mdash;"O &s;ave me&mdash;&s;ave me from the Marquis!"</P>
<P>"Ri&s;e then," &s;aid he, "and dre&s;s your&s;elf quickly&mdash;I &s;hall be back again in a few minutes." He lighted a candle that &s;tood on the table, and left the chamber.

She threw her clothes ha&s;|tily on, and then &s;at down to await the return of La Motte. A con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed, yet he did not appear, and, having in vain endeavoured to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, the pain of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e at length became &s;o in&s;upportable, that &s;he opened the door of her chamber, and went to the top of the &s;tairca&s;e to

li&s;ten, She thought &s;he heard voices below; but, con&s;idering that if the Marquis was there her appearance could only increa&s;e her danger, &s;he checked the &s;tep &s;he had almo&s;t involuntarily taken to di&s;cend. Still &s;he li&s;tened, and &s;till thought &s;he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed voices. Soon after &s;he heard a door &s;hut, and then foot&s;teps, and &s;he ha&s;tened back to her chamber.</P>
<P>Near a quarter of an hour elap&s;ed and La Motte did not appear. When again &s;he thought &s;he heard a murmer of voices below, and al&s;o pa&s;&s;ing &s;teps, and at length her anxiety not &s;uffer|ing her to remain in her room, &s;he moved through t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;age that communicated with the &s;piral &s;tairca&s;e; but all was now &s;till. In a few moments, however, a light fla&s;hed acro&s;s the hall, and La Motte appeared at the door of the vaulted room. He looked up, and &s;eeing Adeline in the gallery, beckoned her to de&s;cend.</P>
<P>She he&s;itated and looked towards her chamber; but La Mot|te now approached the &s;tairs, and with faltering &s;teps, &s;he went to meet him. "I fear the Marquis may &s;ee me," &s;aid &s;he, whi&s;pering; "where is he?" La Motte took her hand, and led her on, a&s;&s;uring her &s;he had nothing to fear from the Marquis. The wildne&s;s of his looks, however, and the trembling of his hand, &s;eemed to contradict this a&s;&s;urance, and &s;he inquired whither he was leading her. "To the fore&s;t," &s;aid La Motte "that you may e&s;cape from the abbey&mdash;a hor&s;e waits for you without. "I can &s;ave you by no other means." New terror &s;eized her. She would &s;carcely believe that La Motte, who had hitherto con&s;pired with the Marquis, and had &s;o clo&s;ely confined her, &s;hould now him&s;elf undertake her e&s;cape, and &s;he at this moment felt a dreadful pre&s;entiment, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> impo&s;&s;ible to account for, that he was leading her out to murder her in the fore&s;t. Again &s;hrinking back, &s;he &s;upplicated his mercy. He a&s;&s;ured her he meant only to protect her, and de&s;ired &s;he wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not wa&s;te time.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething in his manner that &s;poke &s;incerity, and &s;he &s;uffered him to conduct her to a &s;ide door that opened into the fore&s;t, where &s;he could ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h through the gloom a man on hor&s;eback. This brought to her remembrance the night in which &s;he had quitted the tomb, when tru&s;ting to the per&s;on who appeared, &s;he had been carried to the Marquis's villa. La Motte called, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was an&s;wered by Peter, who&s;e voice &s;ome|what re-a&s;&s;ured Adeline.</P>
<P>He then told her that the Marquis, would return to the abbey on the following morning, and that this could be her only op|portunity
<PB N="57" REF="029379_0108_0FE08D0D6B324210">
of e&s;caping his de&s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; that &s;he might rely upon his (La Motte's) word, that Peter had orders to carry her wherever &s;he cho&s;e; but as he knew the Marquis would be indefatigable in &s;earch of her, he advi&s;ed her by all means to leave the king|dom, which &s;he might do with Peter who was a native of Savoy, and would convey her to the hou&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter. There &s;he might remain till La Motte him&s;elf who did not now think it would be &s;afe to continue much longer in France, &s;hould join her. He entreated her whatever might happen, never to men|tion the events which had pa&s;&s;ed at the abbey. "To &s;ave you, Adeline&punc; I have ri&s;ked my life; do not encrea&s;e my danger, and your own by any unnece&s;&s;ary di&s;coveries. We may never meet again, but I hope you will be happy; and remember when you think of me, that I am not quite &s;o bad as I have been tempted to be."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he gave her &s;ome money, which he told her would be nece&s;&s;ary to defray the expen&s;es of her journey. Ade|line could no longer doubt his &s;incerity, and her tran&s;ports of joy and gratitude would &s;carcely permit her to thank him. She wi&s;hed to have bid Madame La Motte farewell, and indeed earne&s;tly reque&s;ted it; but he again told her &s;he had no time to lo&s;e, and, having wrapped her in a large cloak, he lifted her upon the hor&s;e. She bade him adieu with tears of gratitude, and Peter &s;et off as fa&s;t as the darkne&s;s would permit.</P>
<P>When they were got &s;ome way, "I am glad with all my heart, Ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid he, "to &s;ee you again. Who would have thought, after all, that my ma&s;ter him&s;elf would have bid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> take you away!&mdash;Well, to be &s;ure, &s;trange things come to pa&s;s; but we &s;hall have better luck this time." Adeline not chu&s;ing to reproach him with the treachery of which &s;he feared he had been formerly guilty, thanked him for his good wi&s;hes, and &s;aid &s;he hoped they &s;hould be more fortunate: But Peter, in his u&s;ual &s;train of eloquence, proceeded to undeceive her in this point, and to acquaint her with every circum&s;tance which his memory, and it was naturally a &s;trong one, could furni&s;h.</P>
<P>Peter expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch an artle&s;s intere&s;t in her welfare and &s;uch a concern for her di&s;appointment, that &s;he could no longer doubt his faithfulne&s;s; and this conviction not only &s;trengthen|ed her confidence in the pre&s;ent undertaking, but made her li&s;|ten to his conver&s;ation with kindne&s;s and plea&s;ure. "I &s;hould never have &s;taid at the abbey till this time," &s;aid he, "if I could have got away; but my ma&s;ter frighted me &s;o about the Marquis, and I had not money enough to carry me into my own

country, &s;o that I was forced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tay. It's well we have got &s;ome &s;olid louis-d'ors now; for I que&s;tion Ma'am&s;elle, whether the people on the road would have taken tho&s;e trinkets you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|merly talked of for money."</P>
<P>"Po&s;&s;ibly not," &s;aid Adeline; "I am thankful to Mon&s;ieur La Motte that we have more certain means of procuring con|veniences. What route &s;hall you take when we leave the fore&s;t, Peter?"&mdash;Peter mentioned very correctly a great part of the road to Lyons: "and then," &s;aid he, "we can ea&s;ily get to Savoy, and that will be nothing. My &s;i&s;ter, God ble&s;s her! I hope is living; I have not &s;een her many a year, but if &s;he is not, all the people will be glad to &s;ee me, and you will ea&s;ily get a lodging, Ma'am&s;elle, and every thing you want."</P>
<P>Adeline re&s;olved to go with him to Savoy. La Motte, who knew the character and de&s;igns of the Marquis, had advi&s;ed her to leave the kingdom, and had told her, what her fears would have &s;ugge&s;ted, that the Marquis would be indefatigable in &s;earch of her. His motive for this advice mu&s;t be a de&s;ire of &s;erving her; why el&s;e, when &s;he was already in his power, &s;hould he remove her to another place, and even furni&s;h her with money for the expen&s;es of a journey?</P>
<P>At Leloncourt, where Peter &s;aid he was well known, &s;he would be mo&s;t likely to meet with protection and comfort, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould his &s;i&s;ter be dead; and its di&s;tance and &s;olitary &s;ituation were circum&s;tances that plea&s;ed her. The&s;e reflections would have pointed out to her the prudence of proceeding to Savoy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he been le&s;s de&s;titute of re&s;ources in France; in her pre|&s;ent &s;ituation they proved it to be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>She inquired farther concerning the route they were to taken and whether Peter was &s;ufficiently acquainted with the road&mdash; "When once I get to Thiers, I know it well enough," &s;aid Pe|ter, "for I have gone it many a time in my younger days, and any body will tell us the way there." They travelled for &s;everal hours in darkne&s;s and &s;ilence, and it was not till they emerged from the fore&s;t that Adeline &s;aw the morning light &s;treak the ea&s;tern clouds. The &s;ight cheered and revived her; and as &s;he travelled &s;ilently along, her mind revolved the events of the pa&s;t night and meditated plans for the future. The pre&s;ent kind|ne&s;s of La Motte appeared &s;o very different from his former c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+duct, that it a&s;toni&s;hed and perplexed her, and &s;he could only account for it by attributing it to one of tho&s;e &s;udden impul&s;e of humanity which &s;ometimes operate even upon the mo&s;t de|praved hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="029379_0109_0FE08D1A24E41398">But when &s;he recollected his former words, "that he was not ma&s;ter of him&s;elf," &s;he could &s;carcely believe that mere pity could induce him to break the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds which had hitherto &s;o &s;trongly held him, and then, con&s;idering the altered conduct of the Marquis, &s;he was inclined to think that &s;he owed her liberty to &s;ome change in his &s;entiments towards her; yet the advice La Motte had given her to quit the kingdom, and the money with which he had &s;upplied her for that purpo&s;e, &s;eemed to con|tradict this opinion, and involved her again in doubt.</P>
<P>Peter now got directions to Thiers, which place they reached without any accident, and there &s;topped to refre&s;h them&s;elves. As &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Peter thought the hor&s;e &s;ufficiently re&s;ted, they again &s;et forward, and from the rich plains of the Lyonnois, Adeline, for the fir&s;t time caught a view of the di&s;tant Alps, who&s;e ma|je&s;tic heads &s;eeming to prop the vault of heaven, filled her mind with &s;ublime emotions.</P>
<P>In a few hours they reached the vale, in which &s;tands the city of Lyons, who&s;e beautiful environs, &s;tudded with villas, and rich with cultivation, withdrew Adeline from the melancholy contemplation of her own circum&s;tances, and her more painful anxiety for Theodore.</P>
<P>When they reached that bu&s;y city, her fir&s;t care was to in|quire concerning the pa&s;&s;age of the Rhone; but &s;he forbore to make the&s;e inquiries of the people of the inn, con&s;idering that if the Marquis &s;hould trace her thither they might enable him to pur&s;ue her route. She, therefore, &s;ent Peter to the quays to hire a boat, while &s;he her&s;elf took a &s;light repa&s;t, it being her intention to embark immediately. Peter pre&s;ently returned, having engaged a boat and men to take them up the Rhone to the neare&s;t part of Savoy, from whence they were to proceed by land to the village of Leloncourt.</P>
<P>Having taken &s;ome refre&s;hment, &s;he ordered him to conduct her to the ve&s;&s;el. A new and &s;triking &s;cene pre&s;ented it&s;elf to Adeline, who looked with &s;urpri&s;e upon the river gay with ve&s;&s;els, and the quay crowded with bu&s;y faces, and felt the con|tra&s;t which the cheerful objects around bore to her&s;elf&mdash;to her an orphan, de&s;olate, helple&s;s, and flying from per&s;ecution and her country. She &s;poke with the Ma&s;ter of the boat, and hav|ing &s;ent Peter back to the inn for the hor&s;e, (La Motte's gift to Peter in lieu of &s;ome arrears of wages) they embarked.</P>
<P>As they &s;lowly pa&s;&s;ed up the Rhone, who&s;e &s;teep banks crown|ed with mountains&punc; exhibited the mo&s;t various, wild and roman|tic &s;cenery, Adeline &s;at in a pen&s;ive reverie. The novelty of
<PB N="60" REF="029379_0110_0FE08D1ED9407E28">
the &s;cene through which &s;he floated, now frowning with &s;avage grandeur, and now &s;miling in fertility, and gay with towns and villages &s;oothed her mind, and her &s;orrow gradually &s;oftened into a gentle and not unplea&s;ing melancholy. She had &s;eated her&s;elf at the head of the boat, where &s;he watched its &s;ides cleave the &s;wift &s;tream, and li&s;tened to the da&s;hing of the waters.</P>
<P>The boat, &s;lowly oppo&s;ing the current, pa&s;&s;ed along for &s;ome hours, and at length the veil of evening was &s;tretched over the land&s;cape. The weather was fine, and Adeline, regardle&s;s of the dews that now fell, remained in the open air, ob&s;erving the objects darken round her, the gay tints of the horizon fade away, and the &s;tars gradually appear, trembling upon the lucid mirror of the waters. The &s;cene was now &s;unk in deep &s;hadow, and the &s;ilence of the hour was broken only by the mea&s;ured da&s;hing of the oars, and now and then by the voice of Peter &s;peaking to the boatmen. Adeline &s;at lo&s;t in thought: the for|lornne&s;s of her circum&s;tances came heightened to her imagination.</P>
<P>She &s;aw her&s;elf &s;urrounded by the darkne&s;s and &s;tillne&s;s of night, in a &s;trange place, far di&s;tant from any friends, going, &s;he &s;carcely knew whither, under the guidance of &s;trangers and pur&s;ued, perhaps, by an inveterate enemy. She pictured to her&s;elf the rage of the Marquis, now that he had di&s;covered her flight, and though &s;he knew it very unlikely he &s;hould follow her by water, for which rea&s;on &s;he had cho&s;en that manner of travelling, &s;he trembled at the portrait her fancy drew. Her thoughts then wandered to the plan &s;he &s;hould adopt after reach|ing Savoy; and much as her experience had prejudiced her again&s;t the manners of a convent, &s;he &s;aw no place more likely to afford her a proper a&s;ylum. At length &s;he retired to the little cabin for a few hours ropo&s;e.</P>
<P>She awoke with the dawn, and her mind being too much di&s;turbed to &s;leep again, &s;he ro&s;e and watched the gradual ap|proach of day. As &s;he mu&s;ed, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed the feelings of the moment in the following</P>

<P>When Adeline left the Abbey, La Motte had remained for &s;ome time at the gate li&s;tening to the &s;teps of the hor&s;e that carried her, till the &s;ound was lo&s;t in di&s;tance; he then turned into the hall with a lightne&s;s of heart to which he had long been a &s;tranger. The &s;atisfaction of having thus pre&s;erved her as he hoped, from the de&s;igns of the Marquis, overcame for a while all &s;en&s;e of the danger in which this &s;tep mu&s;t involve him. But when he returned entirely to his own &s;ituation, the terrors of the Marquis's re&s;entment &s;truck their full force upon his mind, and he con&s;idered how he might be&s;t e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>It was now pa&s;t midnight&mdash;the Marquis was expected early on the following day; and in this interval, it at fir&s;t appeared probable to him that he might quit the fore&s;t. There was only one hor&s;e; but he con&s;idered whether it would be be&s;t to &s;et off immediately for Auboine, where a carrige might be procur|ed to convey his family and his moveables from the abbey or quietly to await the arrival of the Marquis, and endeavour to impo&s;e upon him by a forged &s;tory of Adeline's e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The time which mu&s;t elap&s;e before a carriage could reach the abbey would leave him &s;carcely &s;ufficient to e&s;cape from the fore&s;t; what money he had remaining from the Marquis's boun|ty would not carry him far; and when it was expended he mu&s;t probably be at a lo&s;s for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;hould he not before then be detected. By remaining at the abbey it would appear that he was uncon&s;cious of de&s;erving the Marquis's re&s;entment, and though he could not expect to impre&s;s a belief upon him that his orders had been executed, he might make it appear that Pe|ter only had been acce&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry to the e&s;cape of Adeline; an ac|count which would &s;eem the more probable from Peters having been formerly detected in a &s;imilar &s;cheme. He believed al&s;o that if the Marquis &s;hould threaten to deliver him into the hands of ju&s;tice, he might &s;ave him&s;elf by a menace of di&s;clo&s;ing the crime he had commi&s;&s;ioned him to perpetrate.</P>
<P>Thus arguing La Motte re&s;olved to remain at the Abbey and await the event of the Marquis's di&s;appointment.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="029379_0111_0FE08D2D61C5A910">When the Marquis did arrive, and was informed of Adeline's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">light, the &s;trong workings of his &s;oul, which appeared in his countenance for a while alarmed and terrified La Motte. He cur&s;ed him&s;elf and her in terms of &s;uch coar&s;ene&s;s and vehemence as La Motte was a&s;toni&s;hed to hear from a man who&s;e <HI>manners</HI> were generally amiable, whatever might be the violence and criminality of his pa&s;&s;ions. To invent and expre&s;s the&s;e terms &s;eemed to give him n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t only relief but delight; yet he appear|ed more &s;hocked at the circum&s;tances of her e&s;cape, than exa&s;|perated at the carle&s;&s;ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of La Motte, and recollecting at length that he wa&s;ted time, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> left the Abbey, and di&s;patched &s;everal of his &s;ervants in pur&s;uit of her.</P>
<P>When he was gone, La Motte believing his &s;tory had &s;ucceed|ed, returned to the plea&s;ure of con&s;idering that he had done his duty, and to the hope that Adeline was now beyond the reach of pur&s;uit. This calm was of &s;hort continuance. In a few hours the Marquis retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, accompanied by the officers of ju&s;tice. The affrighted La Motte, perceiving him approach, endeavour|ed to conceal him&s;elf but was &s;eized and carried to the Marquis, who drew him a&s;ide.</P>
<P>"I am not to be impo&s;ed upon," &s;aid he, "by &s;uch a &s;uperficial &s;tory as you have invented; you know your life is in my hands; tell me in&s;tantly where you have &s;ecreted Adeline, or I will charge you with the crime you have committed again&s;t me&punc; but, upon your di&s;clo&s;ing the place of her concealment I will di&s;mi&s;s the officers, and if you wi&s;h it, a&s;&s;i&s;t you to leave the kingdom. You have no time to he&s;itate, and may know that I will not be trifled with." La Motte attempted to appea&s;e the Marquis, and affirmed that Adeline was really fled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> knew not whither. "You will remember, my Lord that yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cha|racter is al&s;o in my power; and, that, if you proceed to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rem|ities, you will compel me to reveal in the face of day that you would have made me a murderer."</P>
<P>"And who will believe you?" &s;aid the Marquis. "The crimes that bani&s;hed you from &s;ociety will be no te&s;timony of your veracity, and that with which I now charge you will bring with it a &s;ufficient pre&s;umption that your accu&s;ation is malicious. Officers do your duty."</P>
<P>They entered the room and &s;eized La Motte, whom terror now deprived of all power of re&s;i&s;tance, could re&s;i&s;tance have availed him, and in the perturbation of his mind he informed the Marquis that Adeline had taken the road to Lyons. This di&s;covery, however, was made too late to &s;erve him&s;elf; the
<PB N="63" REF="029379_0111_0FE08D2D61C5A910">
Marquis &s;eized the advantage it offered, but the charge had been given, and, with the angui&s;h of knowing that he had ex|po&s;ed Adeline to danger without benefitting him&s;elf, La Motte &s;ubmitted in &s;ilence to his fate. Scarcely allowing him time to collect what little effects might ea&s;ily be carried with him, the officers conveyed him from the abbey; but the Marquis, in con&s;ideration of the extreme di&s;tre&s;s of Madame La Motte, di|rected one of his &s;ervants to procure a carriage from Auboine that &s;he might follow her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The Marquis in the mean time, now acquainted with the route Adeline had taken, &s;ent forward his faithful valet to trace her to her place of concealment, and return immediately with intelligence to the villa.</P>
<P>Abandoned to de&s;pair, La Motte and his wife quitted the fore&s;t of Fontangville, which had for &s;o many months afforded them an a&s;ylum, and embarked once more upon the tumultuous world, where ju&s;tice would meet La Motte in the form of de|&s;truction. They had entered the fore&s;t as a refuge, rendered nece&s;&s;ary by the former crimes of La Motte, and for &s;ome time found in it the &s;ecurity they &s;ought; but other offences, for even in that &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot there happened to be temptation, &s;oon &s;ucceeded, and his life, already &s;ufficiently marked by the puni&s;hment of vice, now afforded him another in&s;tance of this great truth, "That where guilt is, there peace cannot enter."</P>

<P>ADELINE, mean while, and Peter proceeded on their voyage, without any accident, and landed in Savoy, where Pe|ter placed her upon the hor&s;e, and him&s;elf walked be&s;ide her. When he came within &s;ight of his native mountains, his extravagant joy bur&s;t forth into frequent exclamations, and he would often a&s;k Adeline, if &s;he had ever &s;een &s;uch <HI>hills</HI> in France. "No, no," &s;aid he, "the hills there are very well for French hills, but they are not to be named on the &s;ame day with ours." Adeline, lo&s;t in admiration of the a&s;toni&s;hing and tremendous &s;cenery around her, a&s;&s;ented very warmly to the truth of Peter's a&s;&s;ertion, which encouraged him to expatiate more largely upon the advantages of his country; its di&s;advan|tages he totally forgot; and though he gave away his la&s;t &s;ons
<PB N="64" REF="029379_0112_0FE08D3242E76C68">
to the children of the pea&s;antry that ran barefooted by the &s;ide of the hor&s;e, he &s;poke of nothing but the happine&s;s and content of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>His native village, indeed, was an exception to the ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> character of the country, and to the u&s;ual effects of an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> government; it was flouri&s;hing, healthy, and happy; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> advantages it chiefly owed to the activity and attention of the benevolent clergyman who&s;e cure it was.</P>
<P>Adeline, who now began to feel the effects of long anxiety and fatigue, much wi&s;hed to arrive at the end of her journey, and inquired impatiently of Peter concerning it. Her &s;pirits, thus weakened, the gloomy grandeur of the &s;cenes which had &s;o lately awakened emotions of delightful &s;ublimity, now awed her into terror; &s;he trembled at the &s;ound of the torrents rol|ling among the clifts and thundering in the vale below, and &s;hrunk from the view of the precipices, which &s;ometimes over|hung the road, and at others appeared beneath it. Fatigued as &s;he was, &s;he frequently di&s;mounted to climb on foot the &s;teep flinty road, which &s;he feared to travel on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The day was clo&s;ing when they drew near a &s;mall village at the foot of the Savoy Alps, and the &s;un in all his evening &s;plendor now &s;inking behind their &s;ummits, threw a farewel gleam athwart the land&s;cape, &s;o &s;oft and glowing as drew from Adeline, languid as &s;he was, an exclamation of rapture.</P>
<P>The romantic &s;ituation of the village next attracted her no|tice. It &s;tood at the foot of &s;everal &s;tupendous mountains, which formed a chain round a lake at &s;ome little di&s;tance, and the woods that &s;wept from the &s;ummits, almo&s;t embo&s;omed the village. The lake, unruffled by the lighte&s;t air, reflected the vermeil tints of the horizon with the &s;ublime &s;cenery o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its borders, darkening every in&s;tant with the falling twilight.</P>
<P>When Peter perceived the village, he bur&s;t into a &s;hout of joy. "Thank God," &s;aid he, "we are near home; there is my dear native place. It looks ju&s;t as it did twenty years age and there are the &s;ame old trees growing round our cottage yonder, and the huge rock that ri&s;es above it. My Poor father died there Ma'am&s;elle. Pray heaven my &s;i&s;ter be alive; it is a long while &s;ince I &s;aw her." Adeline li&s;tened with a melancholy plea&s;ure to the&s;e artl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s expre&s;&s;ions of Peter, who, in retracing the &s;cenes of his former days, &s;eemed to live them over again. As they approached the village he conti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed to point out various objects of his remembrance. "A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d there too is the good pa&s;tor's chateau; look Ma'am&s;elle, that white hou&s;e, with the &s;moke curling, that &s;tands on the edg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="65" REF="029379_0112_0FE08D3242E76C68">
of the lake yonder. I wonder whether he is alive yet. He was not old when I left the place, and as much beloved as ever man was, but death &s;pares nobody!"</P>
<P>They had by this time reached the village which was ex|tremely neat, though it did not promi&s;e much accommodation. Peter had hardly advanced ten &s;teps before he was acco&s;ted by &s;ome of his old acquaintance, who &s;hook hands, and &s;eemed not to know how to part with him. He inquired for his &s;i&s;ter, and was told &s;he was alive and well. As they pa&s;&s;ed on, &s;o many of his old friends flocked round him, that Adeline became quite weary of the delay. Many whom he had left in the vigour of life were now tottering under the infirmities of age, while their &s;ons and daughters, whom he had known only in the playfulne&s;s of infancy, were grown from his re|membrance, and in the pride of youth. At length they ap|proached the cottage, and were met by his &s;i&s;ter, who having heard of his arrival, came and welcomed him with unfeigned joy.</P>
<P>On &s;eeing Adeline, &s;he &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to alight, and conducting her into a &s;mall but neat cottage, re|ceived her with a warmth of ready kindne&s;s which would have graced a better &s;ituation. Adeline de&s;ired to &s;peak with her alone, for the room was now crowded with Peter's friends, and then acquainting her with &s;uch particulars of her circum&s;tances as it was nece&s;&s;ary to communicate, de&s;ired to know if &s;he could be accommodated with lodging in the cottage. "Yes, Ma'am&s;elle," &s;aid the good woman, "&s;uch as it is, you are hear|tily welcome. I am only &s;orry it is not better. But you &s;eem ill, Ma'am&s;elle; what &s;hall I get you?"</P>
<P>Adeline, who had been long &s;truggling with fatigue and in|di&s;po&s;ition, now yielded to their pre&s;&s;ure. She &s;aid &s;he was, indeed, ill; but hoped that re&s;t would re&s;tore her, and de&s;ired a bed might be immediately prepared. The good woman went out to obey her, and &s;oon returning, &s;hewed her to a little cabin, where &s;he retired to a bed, who&s;e cleanline&s;s was its only re|commendation.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding her fatigue, &s;he could not &s;leep, and her mind, in &s;pite of all her efforts, returned to the &s;cenes that were pa&s;&s;ed, or pre&s;ented gloomy and imperfect vi&s;ions of the future.</P>
<P>The difference between her own condition and that of other per&s;ons, educated as &s;he had been, &s;truck her forcibly, and &s;he wept. "They," &s;aid &s;he, "have friends and relations, all &s;triv|ing to &s;ave them not only from what may hurt, but what may di&s;plea&s;e them; watching not only for their pre&s;ent &s;afety, but
<PB N="66" REF="029379_0113_0FE08D3EE6602090">
for their future advantage, and preventing them even from in|juring them&s;elves. But during my whole life I have never known a friend; have been in general &s;urrounded by enemies, and very &s;eldom exempt from &s;ome circum&s;tance either of dan|ger or calamity. Yet &s;urely I am not born to be for ever w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch|ed; the time will come when"&mdash;She began to think &s;he might one time be happy; but recollecting the de&s;perate &s;ituation of Theodore, "No," &s;aid &s;he, "I can never hope even for peace!"</P>
<P>Early the following morning the good woman of the hou&s;e came to inquire how &s;he had re&s;ted, and found &s;he had &s;lept lit|tle, and was much wor&s;e than on the preceding night. The un|ea&s;ine&s;s of her mind contributed to heighten the feveri&s;h &s;ymp|toms that attended her, and in the cour&s;e of the day her di&s;or|der began to a&s;&s;ume a &s;erious a&s;pect. She ob&s;erved its progre&s;s with compo&s;ure, re&s;igning her&s;elf to the will of God, and feel|ing little to regret in life. Her kind ho&s;te&s;s did every thing in her power to relieve her, and there was neither phy&s;ician nor apothecary in the village, &s;o that nature was deprived of none of her advantages. Notwith&s;tanding this, the di&s;order rapidly increa&s;ed, and on the third day from its fir&s;t attack &s;he became delirious; after which &s;he &s;unk into a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction.</P>
<P>How long &s;he remained in this deplorable condition &s;he knew not; but, on recovering her &s;en&s;es, &s;he found her&s;elf in an apart|ment very different from any &s;he remembered. It was &s;pacious and almo&s;t beautiful, the bed and every thing around being in one &s;tile of elegant &s;implicity. For &s;ome minutes &s;he lay in a trance of &s;urpri&s;e, endeavouring to recollect her &s;cattered ideas of the pa&s;t, and almo&s;t fearing to move, le&s;t the plea&s;ing vi&s;ions &s;hould vani&s;h from her eyes.</P>
<P>At length &s;he ventured to rai&s;e her&s;elf, when &s;he pre&s;ently heard a &s;oft voice &s;peaking near her, and the bed curtain on one &s;ide was gently undrawn by a beautiful girl. As &s;he leaned for|ward over the bed, and with a &s;mile of mingled tenderne&s;s and joy, inquired of her patient how &s;he did, Adeline gazed in &s;ilent admiration upon the mo&s;t intere&s;ting female countenance &s;he had ever &s;een, in which the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;weetne&s;s, united with lively &s;en&s;e and refinement, was cha&s;tened by &s;implicity.</P>
<P>Adeline at length recollected her&s;elf &s;ufficiently to thank her kind inquirer, and begged to know to whom &s;he was obliged, and where &s;he was? The lovely girl pre&s;&s;ed her hand, "'Tis we who are obliged," &s;aid &s;he. "Oh! how I rejoice to find you have recovered your recollection." She &s;aid no more, but &s;lew to the door of the apartment, and di&s;appeared. In a few minutes &s;he returned with an elderly lady, who, approaching
<PB N="67" REF="029379_0113_0FE08D3EE6602090">
the bed with an air of tender intere&s;t, a&s;ked concerning the &s;tate of Adeline; to which the latter replied, as well as the agitation of her &s;pirits would permit, and repeated her de&s;ire of knowing to whom &s;he was &s;o greatly obliged. "You &s;hall know that hereafter," &s;aid the lady; "at pre&s;ent be a&s;&s;ured that you are with tho&s;e who will think their care much overpaid by your re|covery; &s;ubmit, therefore, to every thing that may conduce to it, and con&s;ent to be kept as quiet as po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>Adeline gratefully &s;miled, and bowed her head in &s;ilent a&s;&s;ent. The lady now quitted the room for a medicine; having given which to Adeline, the curtain was clo&s;ed, and &s;he was left to repo&s;e. But her thoughts were too bu&s;y to &s;uffer her to profit by the opportunity. She contemplated the pa&s;t, and viewed the pre&s;ent, and when &s;he compared them, the contra&s;t &s;truck her with a&s;toni&s;hment. The whole appeared like one of tho&s;e &s;udden tran&s;itions &s;o frequent in dreams, in which we pa&s;s from grief and de&s;pair, we know not how, to comfort and delight.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he looked forward to the future with a trembling anxi|ty, that threatened to retard her recovery, and which, when &s;he remembered the words of her generous benefactors, &s;he en|deavoured to &s;uppre&s;s. Had &s;he better known the di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;ons in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he now was, her anxiety, as far as it regarded her&s;elf, mu&s;t in a great mea&s;ure have been done away; for La Luc, its owner, was one of tho&s;e rare characters to whom misfortune &s;eldom looks in vain, and who&s;e native goodne&s;s, confirmed by principle, is uniform and una&s;&s;uming in its acts. The following little picture of his dome&s;tic life, his family and his manners, will more fully illu&s;trate his character. It was drawn from the life, and its exactne&s;s will, it is hoped, compen&s;ate for its length.</P>

<P><PB N="68" REF="029379_0114_0FE08D43A6DA8C68">In the village of Leloncourt, celebrated for its picture&s;que &s;ituation at the foot of the Savoy Alps, lived Arnaud La Luc, a clergyman, de&s;cended from an ancient family of France, who&s;e decayed fortunes occa&s;ioned them to &s;eek a retreat in Switzer|land, in an age when the violence of civil commotion &s;eldom &s;pared the conquered. He was mini&s;ter of the village, and equally loved for the piety and benevolence of the Chri&s;tian, as re&s;pected for the dignity and elevation of the philo&s;opher. His was the philo&s;ophy of nature, directed by common &s;en&s;e. He de&s;pi&s;ed the jargon of the modern &s;chools and the brilliant ab|&s;urdities of &s;y&s;tems, which have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed without enlightening, and guided without convincing their di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>His mind was penetrating; his views exten&s;ive; and his &s;y&s;tems, like his religion, were &s;imple rational and &s;ublime. The people of his pari&s;h looked up to him as to a father; for while his precepts directed their minds, his example touched their hearts.</P>
<P>In early youth La Luc lo&s;t a wife, whom he tenderly loved. This event threw a tincture of &s;oft and intere&s;ting melancholy over his character, which remained when time had mellowed the remembrance that occa&s;ioned it. Philo&s;ophy had &s;trength|ened, not hardened, his heart; it enabled him to re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;|&s;ure of affliction, rather than to overcome it.</P>
<P>Calamity taught him to feel with peculiar &s;ympathy the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others. His income from the pari&s;h was &s;mall, and what remained from the divided and reduced e&s;tates of his an|ce&s;tors did not much increa&s;e it; but though he could not al|ways relieve the nece&s;&s;ities of the indigent, his tender pity and holy conver&s;ation &s;eldom failed in admini&s;tering con&s;olation to the mental &s;ufferer. On the&s;e occa&s;ions the &s;weet and exqui&s;ite emotions of his heart have often induced him to &s;ay, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the voluptuary be once &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e feelings, he would ne|ver after forego "the luxury of doing good.&mdash;Ignorance of true plea&s;ure,"&mdash;he would &s;ay, "more frequently than tempta|tion to that which is fal&s;e, leads to vice."</P>
<P>La Luc had one &s;on and a daughter, who were too young, when their mother died to lament their lo&s;s. He loved them with peculiar tenderne&s;s, as the children of her whom he never cea&s;ed to deplore; it was for &s;ome time his &s;ole amu&s;ement to ob&s;erve the gradual unfolding of their infant minds, and to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them to virtue. His was the deep and &s;ilent &s;orrow of the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his complaints he never obtruded upon others, and very &s;eldom did he even mention his wife. His grief was too &s;acred for
<PB N="69" REF="029379_0114_0FE08D43A6DA8C68">
the eye of the vulgar. Often he retired to the deep &s;olitude of the mountains, and amid their &s;olemn and tremendous &s;cenery would brood over the remembrance of times pa&s;t, and re&s;ign him&s;elf to the luxury of grief. On his return from the&s;e little excur&s;ious he was always more placed and contented. A &s;weet tranquillity, which aro&s;e almo&s;t to happine&s;s, was diffu&s;ed over his mind, and his manners were more than u&s;ually benevolent. As he gazed on his children, and fondly ki&s;&s;ed them, a tear would &s;ometimes &s;teal into his eye, but it was a tear of tender regret, unmingled with the darker qualities of &s;orrow, and was mo&s;t precious to his heart.</P>
<P>On the death of his wife he received into his hou&s;e a maiden &s;i&s;ter, a &s;en&s;ible worthy woman, who was deeply intere&s;ted in the happine&s;s of her brother. Her affectionate attention and judicious conduct anticipated the effect of time in &s;oftening the poignancy of his di&s;tre&s;s, and her unremitted care of his chil|dren, while it proved the goodne&s;s of her own heart, attracted her more clo&s;ely to his.</P>
<P>It was with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure that he traced in the infant features of Clara the re&s;emblance of her mother. The &s;ame gentlene&s;s of manner and the &s;ame &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition &s;oon di&s;played them&s;elves, and as &s;he grew up, her actions frequent|ly reminded him &s;o &s;trongly of his lo&s;t wife, as to fix him in reveries which ab&s;orbed all his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Engaged in the duties of his pari&s;h, the education of his chil|dren, and in the philo&s;ophic re&s;earch, his years pa&s;&s;ed in tran|quillity. The tender melancholy with which affliction had tinctured his mind was, by long indulgence, become dear to him, and he would not have relinqui&s;hed it for the brighte&s;t dream of airy happine&s;s. When any pa&s;&s;ing incident di&s;turbed him, he retired for con&s;olation to the idea of her he &s;o faithful|ly loved, and yielding to a gentle, and what the world would call a romantic &s;adne&s;s, gradually rea&s;&s;umed his compo&s;ure. This was the &s;ecret luxury to which he withdrew from tem|porary di&s;appointment&mdash;the &s;olitary enjoyment which di&s;&s;ipated the cloud of care, and blunted the &s;ting of vexation&mdash;which elevated his mind above this world, and opened to his view the &s;ublimity of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">other.</P>
<P>The &s;pot he now inhabited, the &s;urrounding &s;cenery, the ro|mantic beauties of the neighbouring walks, were dear to La Luc, for they had once been loved by Clara; they had been the &s;cenes of her tenderne&s;s, and of his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>His chateau &s;tood on the borders of a &s;mall lake that was al|mo&s;t environed by mountains of &s;tupendous height, which, &s;hoot|ing
<PB N="70" REF="029379_0115_0FE08C064500F5C8">
into a variety of grote&s;que forms, compo&s;ed a &s;cenery &s;in|gularly &s;olemn and &s;ublime. Dark woods intermingled with bold projections of rock, &s;ometimes barren, and &s;ometimes cov|ered with the purple bloom of wild flowers, impended over the lake, and were &s;een in the clear mirror of its waters. The wild and alpine heights which ro&s;e above were either crowned with perpetual &s;nows, or exhibited tremendous crags and ma&s;&s;es of &s;olid rock, who&s;e appearance was continually changing as the rays of light were variou&s;ly reflected on their &s;urface, and who&s;e &s;ummits were often wrap in impenetrable mi&s;ts. Some cotta|ges and hamlets, &s;cattered on the margin of the lake, or &s;eated in picture&s;que points of view on the rocks above, were the only objects that reminded the beholder of humanity.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the lake, nearly oppo&s;ite to the chateau, the mountains receded, and a long chain of Alps were &s;een &s;tretch|ing in per&s;pective. Their innumerable tints and &s;hades, &s;ome veiled in blue mi&s;ts, &s;ome tinged with rich purple, and others glittering in partial light, gave luxurious and magical colouring to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The chateau was not large, but it was convenient and was characteri&s;ed by an air of elegant &s;implicity and good order. The entrance was a &s;mall hall, which opening by a gla&s;s door into the garden, afforded a view of the lake, with the magni|ficent &s;cenery exhibited on its borders. On the left of the hall was La Luc's &s;tudy, where he u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed his mornings; and adjoining was a &s;mall room &s;itted up with chymical apparatus, a&s;tronomical in&s;truments, and other implements of &s;cience. On the right was the family parlour, and behind it a room which belonged exclu&s;ively to Madame La Luc. Here were depo&s;ite various medicines and botanical di&s;tillations, together with the apparatus for preparing them. From this room the whole vil|lage was liberally &s;upplied with phy&s;ical comfort; for it was the pride of Madame to believe her&s;elf &s;kilful in relieving the di&s;orders of her neighbours.</P>
<P>Behind the chateau ro&s;e a tuft of pines, and in front a gentle declivity, covered with verdure and flowers, extended to the lake, who&s;e waters flowed even with the gra&s;s, and gave fre&s;h|ne&s;s to the acacias that waved over its &s;urface. Flowering &s;hrubs, intermingled with mountain a&s;h, cypre&s;s, and ever-green oak, marked the boundary of the garden.</P>
<P>At the return of &s;pring it was Clara's care to direct the young &s;hoots of the plants, to nur&s;e the budding flowers, and to &s;helter them with the luxuriant branches of the &s;hrubs from
<PB N="71" REF="029379_0115_0FE08C064500F5C8">
the cold bla&s;ts that de&s;cended from the mountains. In &s;ummer &s;he u&s;ually ro&s;e with the &s;un, and vi&s;ited her favourite flowers while the dew yet hung glittering on their leaves. The fre&s;h|ne&s;s of early day, with the glowing colouring which then touch|ed the &s;cenery, gave a pure and exqui&s;ite delight to her innocent heart. Born amid the &s;cenes of grandeur and &s;ublimity, &s;he had quickly imbibed a ta&s;te for their charms, which ta&s;te was heightened by the influence of a warm imagination. To view the &s;un ri&s;ing above the Alps, tinging their &s;nowy heads with light, and &s;uddenly darting his rays over the whole face of na|ture&mdash;to &s;ee the fiery &s;plendour of the clouds reflected in the lake below, and the ro&s;eate tints fir&s;t &s;teal upon the rocks above, were among the earlie&s;t plea&s;ures of which Clara was &s;u&s;cepti|ble. From being delighted with the ob&s;ervance of nature, &s;he grew plea&s;ed with &s;eeing her finely imitated, and &s;oon di&s;play|ed a ta&s;te for poetry and painting. When &s;he was about &s;ixteen often &s;elected from her father's library tho&s;e of the Italian poets mo&s;t celebrated for picture&s;que beauty, and would &s;pend the fir&s;t hours of morning in reading them under the &s;hade of the acacias that bordered the lake. Here too &s;he would often at|tempt rude &s;ketches of the &s;urrounding &s;cenery, and at length, by repeated efforts, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome in&s;truction from her brother, &s;he &s;ucceeded &s;o well as to produce twelve drawings in crayon, which were judged worthy of decorating the parlour of the chateau.</P>
<P>Young La Luc played the flute, and &s;he li&s;tened to him with exqui&s;ite delight, particularly when he &s;tood on the margin of the lake, under her beloved acacias. Her voice was &s;weet and flexible, though not &s;trong, and &s;he &s;oon learned to modulate it to the in&s;trument. She new nothing of the intricacies of execution; her airs were &s;imple, and her &s;tile equally &s;o, buy &s;he &s;oon gave them a touching expre&s;&s;ion, in&s;pired by the &s;en&s;ibility of her heart, which &s;eldom left tho&s;e of her hearers unaffected.</P>
<P>It was the happine&s;s of La Luc to &s;ee his children happy, and in one of his excur&s;ions to Geneva, whither he went to vi&s;it &s;ome relations of his late wife, he bought Clara a lute. She re|ceived it with more gratitude than &s;he could expre&s;s; and hav|ing learned one air, &s;he ha&s;tened to her favourite acacias and played it again and again till &s;he forgot every thing be&s;ides. Her little dome&s;tic duties, her books, her drawing, even the hour which her father dedicated to her improvement, when &s;he met her brother in the library, and with him partook of know|ledge, even this hour pa&s;&s;ed unheeded by. La Luc &s;uffered it to pa&s;s. Madame was di&s;plea&s;ed that her niece neglected her
<PB N="72" REF="029379_0116_0FE08D588FD4DF28">
dome&s;tic duties, and wi&s;hed to reprove her, but La Luc begged &s;he would be &s;ilent. "Let experience teach her her error," &s;aid he; "precept &s;eldom brings conviction to young minds."</P>
<P>Madame objected that experience was a &s;low teacher. "It is a &s;ure one," replied La Luc, "and is not unfrequently the quicke&s;t of all teachers: when it cannot lead us into &s;erious evil, it is well to tru&s;t to it."</P>
<P>The &s;econd day pa&s;&s;ed with Clara as the fir&s;t, and the third as the &s;econd. She could now play &s;everal tunes; &s;he came to her father and repeated what &s;he had learnt.</P>
<P>At &s;upper the cream was not dre&s;&s;ed, and there was no fruit on the table. La Luc inquired the rea&s;on; Clara recollected it, and bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed. She ob&s;erved that her brother was ab&s;ent, but nothing was &s;aid. Towards the conclu&s;ion of the repa&s;t he ap|peared; his countenance expre&s;&s;ed unu&s;ual &s;atisfaction, but he &s;eated him&s;elf in &s;ilence, Clara inquired what had detained him from &s;upper, and learnt that he had been to a &s;ick family in the neighbourhood with the weakly allowance which her father gave them. La Luc had entru&s;ted the care of this family to his daughter, and it was her duty to have carried them their little allowance on the preceding day, but &s;he had forgot every thing but mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>"How did you find the woman?" &s;aid La Luc to his &s;on. "Wor&s;e, Sir," he replyed, "for her medicines had not been regu|larly given, and the children had had little or no food to-day."</P>
<P>Clara was &s;hocked. "No food to-day!" &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "and I have been playing all day on my lute, under the aca|cias by the &s;ake!" Her father did not &s;eem to ob&s;erve her emotion, but turned to his &s;on. "I left her better," &s;aid the latter; "the medicines I carried ea&s;ed her pain, and I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee her children make a joyful &s;upper."</P>
<P>Clara, perhaps for the fir&s;t time in her life, envied him his plea&s;ure; her heart was full and &s;he &s;at &s;ilent. "No food to|day," thought &s;he.</P>
<P>She retired pen&s;ively to her chamber. The &s;weet &s;eren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with which &s;he u&s;ually went to re&s;t was vani&s;hed, for &s;he could no longer reflect on the pa&s;t day with &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>"What a pity," &s;aid &s;he, "that what is &s;o plea&s;ing &s;hould be the cau&s;e of &s;o much pain! "This lute is my delight, and my torment!" This reflection occa&s;ioned her much in|ternal debate but before &s;he could come to any re&s;olution up|on the point in que&s;tion, &s;he fell a&s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="029379_0116_0FE08D588FD4DF28">She awoke very early the next morning, and impatiently watched the progre&s;s of the dawn. The &s;un at length appear|ing, &s;he aro&s;e, and determined to make all the attonement in her power for her former neglect, ha&s;tened to the cottage.</P>
<P>Here &s;he remained a con&s;iderable time, and when &s;he return|ed to the chateau her countenance had recovered all its u&s;ual &s;erenity. She re&s;olved, however, not to touch her lute that day.</P>
<P>Till the hour of breakfa&s;t &s;he bu&s;ied her&s;elf in binding up the flowers, and pruning the &s;hoots that were too luxuriant, and &s;he at length found her&s;elf, &s;he &s;carcely knew how, beneath her beloved acacias by the &s;ide of the lake. "Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, with a &s;igh, "how &s;weetly would the &s;ong I learned ye&s;terday, &s;ound now over the waters!" But &s;he remembered her determination, and checked the &s;tep &s;he was involuntarily taking towards the chateau.</P>
<P>She attended her father in the library at the u&s;ual hour, and learned, from his di&s;cour&s;e with her brother on what had been read the two preceding days, that &s;he had lo&s;t much entertain|ing knowledge. She reque&s;ted her father would inform her to what this conver&s;ation alluded; but he calmly-replied, that &s;he had preferred another amu&s;ement at the time when the &s;ubject was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and mu&s;t therefore content her&s;elf with ignorance.</P>
<P>"You would reap the rewards of &s;tudy from the amu&s;ements of idlene&s;s," &s;aid he, "learn to be rea&s;onable&mdash;do not expect to unite incon&s;i&s;tencies."</P>
<P>Clara felt the ju&s;tne&s;s of this rebuke, and remembered her lute. "What mi&s;chief has it occa&s;ioned!" &s;ighed &s;he. "Yes, I am determined not to touch it at all this day. I will prove that I am able to controul my inclinations when I &s;ee it nece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t do." Thus re&s;olving, &s;he applied her&s;elf to &s;tudy with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> than u&s;ual a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>She adhered to her re&s;olution, and towards the clo&s;e of day went into the garden to amu&s;e her&s;elf. The evening was &s;till and uncommonly beautiful. Nothing was heard but the faint &s;hivering of the leaves, which returned but at intervals, making &s;ilence more &s;olemn, and the di&s;tant murmurs of the torrents that rolled among the cliffs. As &s;he &s;tood by the lake, and watched the &s;un &s;lowly &s;inking below the Alps, who&s;e &s;um|mits were tinged with gold and purple; as &s;he &s;aw the la&s;t rays o light gleam upon the waters who&s;e &s;urface was not curled by the lighte&s;t air, &s;he &s;ighed, "Oh! how enchanting would be the &s;ound of my lute at this moment, on this &s;pot, and when every thing is &s;o &s;till around me!"</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="029379_0117_0FE08D6068E74488">The temptation was too powerful for the re&s;olution of Clara: &s;he ran to the chateau, returned with the in&s;trument to her dear acacias, and beneath their &s;hade continued to play till the &s;urrounding objects faded in darkne&s;s from her fight, But the moon aro&s;e, and &s;hedding a trembling lu&s;tre on the lake, made the &s;cene more captivating than ever.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to quit &s;o delightful a &s;pot; Clara repeat|ed her favourite airs again and again. The beauty of the hour awakened all her genius; &s;he never played with &s;uch expre&s;|&s;ion before, and &s;he li&s;tened with increa&s;ing rapture to the tones as they langui&s;hed over the waters and died away on the di&s;tant air. She was perfectly enchanted "No! nothing was ever &s;o delighful as to play on the lute beneath her acacias, on the mar|gin of the lake, by moon-light!"</P>
<P>When &s;he returned to the chateau, &s;upper was over. La Luc had ob&s;erved Clara, and would not &s;uffer her to be interrupted.</P>
<P>When the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the hour was pa&s;&s;ed &s;he recollected that &s;he had broken her re&s;olution, and the reflection gave her pain. "I prided my&s;elf on controling my inclinations," &s;aid &s;he, "and I have weakly yielded to their direction. But what evil have I incurred by indulging them this evening? I have neglected no duty, for I had none to perform. Of what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> have I to accu&s;e my&s;elf? It would have been ab&s;urd to have kept my re&s;olution, and denied my&s;elf a plea&s;ure when there appeared no rea&s;on for this &s;elf-denial."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, not quite &s;atisfied with this rea&s;oning. Sudden|ly re&s;uming her inquiry, "But how," &s;aid &s;he, "am I cer|tain that I &s;hould have re&s;i&s;ted my inclinations if there <HI>had</HI> been a rea&s;on for oppo&s;ing them? If the poor family whom I ne|glected ye&s;terday had been un&s;upplied to day, I fear I &s;hould again have forgotten them while I played on my lute on the banks of the lake."</P>
<P>She then recollected all that her father had at different times &s;aid on the &s;ubject of &s;elf-command, and &s;he felt &s;ome pain.</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid &s;he, "if I do not con&s;ider that to pre&s;erve a re|&s;olution, which I have once &s;olemnly formed, is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to control my inclinations, I fear no other motive would long re&s;train me. I &s;eriou&s;ly determined not to touch my lute this whole day, and I have broken my re&s;olution. To-mor|row perhaps I may be tempted to neglect &s;ome duty, for I have di&s;covered that I cannot rely on my own prudence. Since I cannot conquer temptation, I will fly from it."</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="029379_0117_0FE08D6068E74488">On the following morning &s;he brought her lute to La Luc, and begged he would receive it again, and at lea&s;t keep it till &s;he had taught her inclinations to &s;ubmit to control.</P>
<P>The heart of La Luc &s;welled as &s;he &s;poke. "No, Clara," &s;aid he, "it is unnece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould receive your lute; the &s;acrifice you would make proves you worthy of my confidence. Take back the in&s;trument; &s;ince you have &s;ufficient re&s;olution to re&s;ign it when it leads you from duty, I doubt not that you will be able to control its influence now that it is re&s;tored to you."</P>
<P>Clara felt a degree of plea&s;ure and pride at the&s;e words, &s;uch as &s;he had never before experienced; but &s;he thought, that to de&s;erve the commendation they be&s;towed, it was nece&s;&s;ary to complete the &s;acrifice &s;he had begun. In the virtuous enthu&s;i|a&s;m of the moment the delights of mu&s;ic were forgotten in tho&s;e of a&s;piring to well earned prai&s;e, and when &s;he refu&s;ed the lute thus offered, &s;he was con&s;cious only of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations. "Dear Sir," &s;aid &s;he, tears of plea&s;ure &s;welling in her eyes, "allow me to de&s;erve the prai&s;es you be&s;tow, and then I &s;hall indeed be happy."</P>
<P>La Luc thought &s;he had never re&s;embled her mother &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> this in&s;tant, and, tenderly ki&s;&s;ing her, he for &s;ome moments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt in &s;ilence. When he was able to &s;peak, "You do already de&s;erve my prai&s;es," &s;aid he, "and I re&s;tore your lute as a re|ward for the conduct which excites them." This &s;cene called back recollections too tender for the heart of La Luc, and giv|ing Clara the in&s;trument, he abruptly quitted the room.</P>
<P>La Luc's &s;on, a youth of much promi&s;e, was de&s;igned by his father for the church, and had received from him an excellent education which, however, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould fini&s;h at an univer&s;ity. That of Geneva was fixed upon by La Luc. His &s;cheme had been to make his &s;on not a &s;cholar only; he was ambitious that he &s;hould al&s;o be enviable as a man. From early infancy he had accu&s;tomed him to hardihood and endurance, and as he advanced in youth, he encouraged him in manly exerci&s;es, and acquainted him with the u&s;eful arts as well as with ab&s;tract &s;cience.</P>
<P>He was high &s;pirited and ardent in his temper, but his heart was generous and affectionate. He looked forward to Geneva, and to the new world it would di&s;clo&s;e, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;anguine ex|pectations of youth; and in the delight of the&s;e expectations was ab&s;orbed the regret he would otherwi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e felt at a &s;epa|ration from his family.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="029379_0118_0FE08D6633CBEEF8">A brother of the late Madame La Luc, who was by birth as Engli&s;h woman, re&s;ided at Geneva with his family. To have been related to his wife was a &s;ufficient claim upon the heart of La Luc, and he had, therefore, always kept up an intercour&s;e with Mr. Audley, though the difference in their characters and manner of thinking would never permit this a&s;&s;ociation to ad|vance into friend&s;hip. La Luc now wrote to him, &s;ignifying as intention of &s;ending his &s;on to Geneva, and recommending him to his care; to this letter Mr. Audley returned a friendly an|&s;wer, and a &s;hort time after an acquaintance of La Luc's being called to Geneva, he determined that his &s;on &s;hould accompany him. The &s;eparation was painful to La Luc, and almo&s;t in|&s;upportable to Clara. Madame was grieved, and took care that he &s;hould have a &s;ufficient quantity of medicines put up in his travelling trunk; &s;he was al&s;o at &s;ome pains to point out their virtues, and the different complaints for which they were requi|&s;ite; but &s;he was careful to deliver her lecture during the ab|&s;ence of her brother.</P>
<P>La Luc with his daughter, accompanied his &s;on on hor&s;eback to the next town, which was about eight miles from Lel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">-court, and there again enforcing all the advice he had formerly given him re&s;pecting his conduct and pur&s;uits, and again yield|ing to the tender weakne&s;s of the father, he bade him farewell&punc; Clara wept, and felt more &s;orrow at this parting than the occa|&s;ion could ju&s;tify; but this was almo&s;t the fir&s;t time &s;he had known grief, and &s;he artle&s;sly yielded to its influence.</P>

de&s;ired &s;he would explain her&s;elf, and the woman proceeded to &s;ay, that her brother Peter, whom &s;he had not &s;een for &s;o many years, was arrived, and had brought a young lady to her cottage, who &s;he verily believed was dying. She de&s;cribed her di&s;order, and acquainted Madame with what particulars of her mournful &s;tory Peter had related, failing not to exaggerate &s;uch as her compa&s;&s;ion for the unhappy &s;tranger and her love of the mar|vellous prompted.</P>
<P>The account appeared a very extraordinary one to Madame: but pity for the forlorn condition of the young &s;ufferer induced her to inquire farther into the affair. "Do let me go to her, Madame," &s;aid Clara, who had been li&s;tening with ready com|pa&s;&s;ion to the poor woman's narrative: "do &s;uffer me to go&mdash; &s;he mu&s;t want comforts, and I wi&s;h much to &s;ee how &s;he is."

Clara de&s;ired to accompany her. They put on their hats and followed the good woman to the cottage, where in a very &s;mall clo&s;e room, on a mi&s;erable bed, lay Adeline, pale, emaciated, and uncon&s;cious of all around her. Madame turned to the woman, and a&s;ked how long &s;he had been in this way, while Clara went up to the bed, and taking the almo&s;t lifele&s;s hand that lay on the quilt, looked anxiou&s;ly in her face. "She ob&s;erves nothing," &s;aid &s;he, "poor creature! I wi&s;h &s;he was at the chateau, &s;he would be better accommo|dated, and I could nur&s;e her there." The woman told Madame La Luc, that the young lady had lain in that &s;tate for &s;everal hours. Madame examined her pul&s;e, and &s;hook her head. "This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is very clo&s;e," &s;aid &s;he&mdash;"Very clo&s;e indeed," cried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eagerly; "&s;urely &s;he would be better at the chateau, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld be moved."</P>
<P>"We will &s;ee about that," &s;aid her aunt. "In the mean time let me &s;peak to Peter; it is &s;ome years &s;ince I &s;aw him." She went to the outer room, and the woman ran out of the cattage to look for him. When &s;he was gone. "This is a mi&s;erable habitation for the poor &s;tranger," &s;aid Clara; "&s;he will never be well here: do, Madame, let her be carried to our hou&s;e; I am &s;ure my father would wi&s;h it. Be&s;ides, there is &s;omething in her features, even inanimate as they now are, that prejudices me in her favour."</P>
<P>"Shall I never per&s;uade you to give up that romantic notion of judging people by their faces," &s;aid her aunt. "What &s;ort of a face &s;he has, is of very little con&s;equence&mdash;her condition is
<PB N="78" REF="029379_0119_0FE08D748EE44180">
lamentable, and I am de&s;irous of altering it; but I wi&s;h fir&s;t to a&s;k Peter a few que&s;tions concerning her.</P>
<P>"Thank you my dear aunt," &s;aid Clara; "&s;he will be re|moved then." Madame La Luc was going to reply; but Peter now entered, and expre&s;&s;ing great joy at &s;eeing her again, in|quired how Mon&s;ieur La Luc and Clara did. Clara immedi|ately welcomed hone&s;t Peter to his native place, and he returned her &s;alutation with many expre&s;&s;ions of &s;urpri&s;e at finding her <HI>&s;o much grown.</HI> "Though I have &s;o often dandled you in my arms, Ma'am&s;elle, I &s;hould never have known you again. Young twigs &s;hoot fa&s;t, as they &s;ay."</P>
<P>Madame La Luc now inquired into the particulars of Ade|line's &s;tory, and heard as much as Peter knew of it, being only that his late ma&s;ter found her in a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, and that he had him&s;elf brought her from the Abbey to &s;ave her from a French Marquis. The &s;implicity of Peter's manner would not &s;uffer her to que&s;tion his veracity, though &s;ome of the circum&s;tances he related excited all her &s;urpri&s;e, and awak|ened all her pity. Tears frequently &s;tood in Clara's eyes dur|ing the cour&s;e of his narrative, and when he concluded, &s;he &s;aid, "Dear Madame, I am &s;ure when my father learns the hi&s;|tory of this unhappy young woman, he will not refu&s;e to be a parent to her, and I will be her &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>"She de&s;erves it all," &s;aid Peter, "for &s;he is very good in|deed." He then proceeded in a &s;train of prai&s;e, which was very unu&s;ual with him. "I will go home and con&s;ult my brother about her," &s;aid Madame La Luc, ri&s;ing: "&s;he certainly ought to be removed to a more airy room. The chateau is &s;o near, that I think &s;he may be carried thither without much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P>"Heaven ble&s;s you! Madame," cried Peter, rubbi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hands, "for your goodne&s;s to my poor young lady."</P>
<P>La Luc had ju&s;t returned from his evening walk when they reached the chateau. Madame told him where &s;he had been, and related the hi&s;tory of Adeline and her pre&s;ent condition. "By all means have her removed hither," &s;aid La Luc, who&s;e eyes bore te&s;timony to the tenderne&s;s of his heart. "She can be better attended to here than in Su&s;an's cottage."</P>
<P>"I knew you would &s;ay &s;o, my dear father," &s;aid Clara: "I will go and order the green bed to be prepared for her."</P>
<P>"Be patient, niece," &s;aid Madame La Luc; "there is no occa&s;ion for &s;uch ha&s;te: &s;ome things are to be con&s;idered fir&s;t; but you are young and romantic." La Luc &s;miled, "The evening is now clo&s;ed," re&s;umed Madame; "it will, therefore,
<PB N="79" REF="029379_0119_0FE08D748EE44180">
be dangerous to remove her before morning. Early to morrow a room &s;hall be got ready, and &s;he &s;hall be brought here; in the mean time I will go and make up a medicine, which I hope may be of &s;ervice to her." Clara reluctantly a&s;&s;ented to this delay, and Madame La Luc retired to her clo&s;et.</P>
<P>On the following morning Adeline, wrapped in blankets, and &s;heltered as much as po&s;&s;ible from the air, was brought to the chateau, where the good La Luc de&s;ired &s;he might have every attention paid her, and where Clara watched over her with un|cea&s;ing anxiety and tenderne&s;s. She remained in a &s;tate of tor|por during the greater part of the day, but towards evening &s;he breathed more freely; and Clara, who &s;till watched by her bed, had at length the plea&s;ure of perceiving that her &s;en&s;es were re|&s;tored. It was at this moment that &s;he found her&s;elf in the &s;ituation from which we have digre&s;&s;ed to give this account of the venerable La Luc and his family. The reader will find that his virtues and his friend&s;hip to Adeline de&s;erved this notice.</P>

<P>ADELINE, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a fine con&s;titution, and the kind at|tentions of her new friends, was in a little more than a week &s;o much recovered as to leave her chamber. She was introduced to La Luc, whom &s;he met with tears of gratitude, and thanked for his goodne&s;s in a manner &s;o warm, yet &s;o artle&s;s, as inter|e&s;ted him &s;till more in her favour. During the progre&s;s of her recovery, the &s;weetne&s;s of her behaviour had entirely won the heart of Clara, and greatly intere&s;ted that of her aunt, who&s;e reports of Adeline, together with the prai&s;es be&s;towed by Clara, had excited both e&s;teem and curio&s;ity in the brea&s;t of La Luc; and he now met her with an expre&s;&s;ion of benig|nity which &s;poke peace and comfort to her heart. She had acquainted Madame La Luc with &s;uch particulars of her &s;tory as Peter, either through ignorance or inattention, had not com|municated, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing only, through a fal&s;e delicacy, perhaps,
<PB N="80" REF="029379_0120_0FE08D793984BB40">
an acknowledgement of her attachment to Theodore. The&s;e circum&s;tances were repeated to La Luc, who, ever &s;en&s;ible to the &s;ufferings of others, was particularly intere&s;ted by the &s;in|gular misfortunes of Adeline.</P>
<P>Near a fortnight had elap&s;ed &s;ince her removal to the cha|teau, when one morning La Luc de&s;ired to &s;peak with her alone. She followed him into his &s;tudy, and then in a man|ner the mo&s;t delicite, he told her, that, as he found &s;he was &s;o unfortunate in her father, he de&s;ired &s;he would henceforth con|&s;ider him as her perent, and his hou&s;e as her home. "You and Clara &s;hall be equally my daughters," continued he; I am rich in having &s;uch children." The &s;trong emotions of &s;urpri&s;e and gratitude for &s;ome time kept Adeline &s;ilent. "Do not thank me, &s;aid La Luc; "I know all you would &s;ay, and I know al&s;o that I am but doing my duty. I thank God that my du|ty and my plea&s;ures are generally in uni&s;on." Adeline wiped away the tears which his goodne&s;s had excited, and was going to &s;peak; but La Luc pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and, turning away to conceal his emotion, walked out of the room.</P>
<P>Adeline was now con&s;idered as a part of the family, and in the parental kindne&s;s of La Luc, the &s;i&s;terly affection of Cla|ra, and the &s;teady and uniform regard of Madame, &s;he would have been happy as &s;he was thankful, had not uncea&s;ing anxiety for the fate of Theodore, of whom in this &s;olitude &s;he was le&s;s likely than ever to hear, corroded her heart, and embittered every moment of reflection. Even when &s;leep obliterated for a while the memory, of the pa&s;t, his image frequently aro&s;e to her fancy, accompanied by all the exegrations of terror. She &s;aw him in chains, and &s;truggling in the gra&s;p of ruffians&punc; or &s;aw him led, amid&s;t the dreadful preparations for execution, into the field: She &s;aw the agony of his look, and heard him repeat her name in frantic accents till the horrors of the &s;cene overcame her, and &s;he awoke.</P>
<P>A &s;imilarity of ta&s;te and character attached her to Clara, yet the mi&s;ery that preyed upon her heart was of a nature too de|licate to be &s;poken of, and &s;he never mentioned Theodore even to her friend. Her illne&s;s had yet left her weak and languid, and the perpetual anxiety of her mind contributed to prolong this &s;tate. She endeavoured by &s;trong and almo&s;t continual ef|forts, to ab&s;tract her thoughts from their mournful &s;ubject, and was often &s;ucce&s;sful. La Luc had an excellent library, and the in&s;truction it offered at once gratified her love of know|ledge, and withdrew her mind from painful recollections. His conver&s;ation too afforded her another refuge from mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="029379_0120_0FE08D793984BB40">But her chief amu&s;ement was to wander among the &s;ublime &s;cenery of the adjacent country, &s;ometimes with Clara, though often with no other companion than a book. There were in|deed times when the conver&s;ation of her friend impo&s;ed a pain|ful re&s;traint, and, when given up to reflection &s;he would ramble alone through &s;cenes, who&s;e &s;olitary grandeur a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;ooth|ed the melancholy of her heart. Here &s;he would retrace all the conduct of her beloved Theodore, and endeavoured to re|collect his exact countenance, his air, and manner. Now &s;he would weep at the remembrance and then, &s;uddenly con&s;ider|ing that he had perhaps already &s;uffered an ignomenious death for her &s;ake, even in con&s;equence of the very action which had proved his love, a dreadful de&s;pair would &s;eize her, and arre&s;t|ing her tears, would threaten to bear down every barrier that fortitude and rea&s;on could oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Fearing longer to tru&s;t her own thoughts, &s;he would hurry home, and by a de&s;perate effort would try to lo&s;e, in the con|ver&s;ation of La Luc, the remembrance of the pa&s;t. Her me|lancholy, when he ob&s;erved it, La Luc, attributed to a &s;en&s;e of the cruel treatment &s;he had received from her father; a cir|cum&s;tance which, by exciting his compa&s;&s;ion, endeared her more &s;trongly to his heart; while that love of rational con|ver&s;ation, which in her calmer hours &s;o frequently appeared, opened to him a new &s;ource of amu&s;ement in the cultivation of mind eager for knowledge, and &s;u&s;ceptible of all the energies of genius. She found a melancholy plea&s;ure in li&s;tening to the &s;oft tones of Clara's lute, and would often &s;oothe her mind by attempting to repeat the airs &s;he heard.</P>
<P>The gentlene&s;s of her manners, partaking &s;o much of that pen&s;ive character which marked La Luc's, was &s;oothing to his heart, and tinctured his behaviour with a degree of tenderne&s;s that imparted comfort to her, and gradually won her entire con|fidence and affection. She &s;aw with extreme concern the de|clining &s;tate of his health, and united her efforts with tho&s;e of the family to amu&s;e and revive him.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ing &s;ociety of which &s;he partook, and the quietne&s;s of the country, at length re&s;tored her mind to a &s;tate of tolera|ble compo&s;ure. She was now acquainted with all the wild walks of the neighbouring mountains, and, never tired of view|ing their a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenery, &s;he often indulged her&s;elf in tra|ver&s;ing alone their unfrequented paths, where now and then a pea&s;ant from a neighbouring village was all that interrupted the profound &s;olitude. She generally took with her a book,
<PB N="82" REF="029379_0121_0FE08D8627FCFFE0">
that if &s;he perceived her thoughts inclined to fix on the one object of her grief, &s;he might force them to a &s;ubject le&s;s dan|gerous to her peace. She had become a tolerable proficient in Engli&s;h while at the convent where &s;he received her education, and the in&s;truction of La Luc, who was well acquainted with the language, now &s;erved to perfect her. He was partial to the Engli&s;h; he admired their character, and the con&s;titution of their laws, and his library contained a collection of their be&s;t authors, particularly of their philo&s;ophers and poets. Adeline found that no &s;pecies of writing had power &s;o effectually to withdraw her mind from the contemplation of its own mi&s;ery, as the higher kinds of poetry, and in the&s;e her ta&s;te &s;oon taught her to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h from that of the French. The genius of the language more perhaps than the genius of the people, if indeed the di&s;tinction may be al|lowed, occa&s;ioned this.</P>
<P>She frequently took a volume of Shake&s;pear or Milton, and, having gained &s;ome wild eminence, would &s;eat her&s;elf beneath the pines, who&s;e low murmurs &s;oothed her heart, and con&s;pired with the vi&s;ions of the poet to lull her to forgetfulne&s;s of grief.</P>
<P>One evening, when Clara was engaged at home, Adeline wandered alone to a favourite &s;pot among the rocks that bor|dered the lake. It was an eminence which commanded an en|tire view of the lake, and of the &s;tupendous mountains that en|vironed it. A few ragged thorns grew from the precipice be|neath, which de&s;cended perpendicularly to the water's edge; and above ro&s;e a thicK wood of larch, pine, and &s;ir, intermingled with &s;ome che&s;nut and mountain a&s;h. The evening was fine, and the air &s;o &s;till, that it &s;carcely waved the light leaves of the trees around, or rimpled the broad expan&s;e of the waters below. Adeline gazed on the &s;cene with a kind of &s;till rapture, and watched the &s;un &s;inking amid a crim&s;on glow, which tinted the bo&s;om of the lake and the &s;nowy heads of the di&s;tant Alps. The delight which the &s;cenery in&s;pired
<Q><L>"Sooth'd each gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion into peace,</L>
<L>"All but the &s;wellings of the &s;often'd heart,</L>
<L>"That waken, not di&s;turb, the tranquil mind!"</L></Q>
was now heightened by the tones of a French horn, and, look|ing on the lake, &s;he perceived at &s;ome di&s;tance a plea&s;ure boat. As it was a &s;pectacle rather uncommon in this &s;olitude, &s;he con|cluded the boat contained a party of foreigners come to view the wonderful &s;cenery of the country, or perhaps of Genevois who cho&s;e to amu&s;e them&s;elves on a lake as grand, though

much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s exten&s;ive than their own; and the latter conjecture was probably ju&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;he li&s;tened to the mellow and enchanting tones of the horn, which gradually &s;unk away in di&s;tance, the &s;cene appeared more lovely than before, and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to forbear at|tempting to paint in language what was &s;o beautiful in reality, &s;he compo&s;ed the following

<P>La Luc ob&s;erving how much Adeline was charmed with the features of the country, and de&s;irous of amu&s;ing her melancholy, which notwith&s;tanding her efforts, was often too apparent, wi&s;hed to &s;hew her other &s;cenes than tho&s;e to which her walks was circum&s;cribed. He propo&s;ed a party on hore&s;eback to take a nearer view of the Glaciers; to attempt their a&s;cent was a diffi|culty
<PB N="84" REF="029379_0122_0FE08D8AB5C8EFA8">
and fatigue to which neither La Luc, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of health, nor Adeline were equal. She had not been accu&s;tom|ed to ride &s;ingle, and the mountainous road they were to pa&s;s made experiment rather dangerous; but &s;he concealed her fears, and they were not &s;ufficient to make her wi&s;h to forego an en|joyment &s;uch as was now offered her.</P>
<P>The following day was fixed for this excur&s;ion. La Luc and his party aro&s;e at an early hour, and having taken a &s;light breakfa&s;t, they &s;at out towards the Glacier of Montanvert, which lay at a few leagues di&s;tance, Peter carried a &s;mall ba&s;|ket of provi&s;ions; and it was their plan to dine on &s;ome plea|&s;ant &s;pot in the open air.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the high enthu&s;ia&s;m of Adeline the more complacent plea&s;ure of La Luc, and the tran&s;ports of Clara, as the &s;cenes of this romantic country &s;hifted to their eyes. Now frowning in dark and gloomy grandeur, it exhibited only tremendous rocks, and cataracts rolling from the heights into &s;ome deep and narrow valley, along which their united water roared and foamed, and bur&s;t away to regions inacce&s;&s;ible to to mortal foot; and now the &s;cene aro&s;e lefs fiercely wild;
<Q>"The pomp of groves and garniture of fields"</Q>
were intermingled with the ruder features of nature, and while the &s;now froze on the &s;ummit of the mountain, the vine bru&s;h|ed at its foot.</P>
<P>Engaged in intere&s;ting conver&s;ation, and by the admiration which the country excited, they travelled on till noon, when they looked round for a plea&s;ant &s;pot where they might re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and take refre&s;hment. At &s;ome little di&s;tance they perceived the ruins of a fabric which had once been a ca&s;tle; it &s;tood al|mo&s;t on a point of rock that overhung a deep valley; and its broken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urrets ri&s;ing from among the woods that embo&s;omed it, heightened the picture&s;que beauty of the obiect.</P>
<P>The edifice invited curio&s;ity, and the &s;hades repo&s;e&mdash; La Luc and his party advanced.</P>
<Q><L>"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eep &s;truck with awe, they mark'd the dome o'erthrown,</L>
<L>"Where once the beauty bloom'd, the warrior &s;hone:</L>

<L>"They lo&s;e &s;tone tott'ring o'er the trembling &s;hade."</L></Q>
<P>They &s;eated them&s;elves on the gra&s;s under the &s;hade of &s;ome high trees near the ruins. An opening in the woods afforded a view of the di&s;tant Alps&mdash;the deep &s;ilence of &s;olitude reigned. For &s;ome time they were lo&s;t in meditation. Adeline felt a
<PB N="85" REF="029379_0122_0FE08D8AB5C8EFA8">
&s;weet complacency, &s;uch as &s;he had long been a &s;tranger to. Looking at La Luc, &s;he perceived a tear &s;tealing down his cheek, while the elevation of his mind was &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed on his countenance. He turned on Clara his eyes, which were now filled with tenderne&s;s, and made an effort to recover him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"The &s;tillne&s;s and total &s;eclu&s;ion of this &s;cene," &s;aid Ade|line, "tho&s;e &s;tupendous mountains, the gloomy grandeur of the&s;e woods, together with that monument of faded glory on which the hand of time is &s;o emphatically impre&s;&s;ed, diffu&s;e a &s;acred enthu&s;ia&s;m over the mind, and awaken &s;en&s;ations truly &s;ublime."</P>
<P>La Luc was going to &s;peak; but Peter coming forward, de&s;ired to know whether he had not better open the wallet, as he fancied his honour and the young ladies mu&s;t be main hun|gry, jogging on &s;o far up hill and down before dinner. They acknowledged the truth of hone&s;t Peter's &s;u&s;picion, and accept|ed his hint.</P>
<P>Refre&s;hments were &s;pread on the gra&s;s, and having &s;eated them&s;elves under the canopy of waving woods, &s;urrounded by the &s;weets of wild flowers, they inhaled the poor breeze of the Alps, which might be called &s;pirit of air, and partook of a repa&s;t which the&s;e circum&s;tances rendered delicious.</P>
<P>When they aro&s;e to depart, "I am unwilling," &s;aid Clara, "to quit this charming &s;pot. How delightful would it be to pa&s;s one's life beneath the&s;e &s;hades with the friends who are dear to one!"&mdash;La Luc &s;miled at the romantic &s;implicity of the idea; but Adeline &s;ighed deeply to the image of felicity, and of Theodore, which it recalled, and turned away to con|ceal her tears.</P>
<P>They now mounted their hor&s;es, and &s;oon after arrived at the foot of Montanvert. The emotions of Adeline, as &s;he con|templated in various points of view the a&s;toni&s;hing objects around her, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all expre&s;&s;ion; and the feelings of the whole party were too &s;trong to admit of conver&s;ation. The profound &s;tillne&s;s which reigned in the&s;e regions of &s;olitude in&s;pired awe, and heightened the &s;ublimity of the &s;cenery to an exqui&s;ite degree.</P>
<P>"It &s;eems," &s;aid Adeline, "as if we were walking over the ruins of the world, and were the only per&s;ons who had &s;ur|vived the wreck. I can &s;carcely per&s;uade my&s;elf that we are not left alone on the globe."</P>
<P>"The view of the&s;e objects," &s;aid La Luc, "lifts the &s;oul to their Great Author, and we contemplate with a feeling al|mo&s;t

too va&s;t for humanity&mdash;the &s;ublimity of his nature in the grandeur of his works." La Luc rai&s;ed his eyes, filled with tears, to heaven, and was for &s;ome moments lo&s;t in &s;ilent adoration.</P>
<P>They quitted the&s;e &s;cenes with extreme reluctance; but the hour of the day, and the appearance of the clouds, which &s;eemed gathering for a &s;torm, made them ha&s;ten their departure. Could &s;he have been &s;heltered from its fury, Adeline almo&s;t wi&s;hed to have witne&s;&s;ed the tremendous effect of a thunder &s;torm in the&s;e regions.</P>
<P>They returned to Leloncourt by a different route, and the &s;hade of the overhanging precipices was deepened by the gloom of the atmo&s;phere. It was evening when they came within view of the lake, which the travellers rejoiced to &s;ee, for the &s;torm &s;o long threatened was now fa&s;t approaching; the thun|der murmered among the Alps; and the dark vapours that rolled heavily along their &s;ides heightened their dreadful &s;ublimity. La Luc would have quickened his pace, but the road winding down the &s;teep &s;ide of a mountain made caution nece&s;&s;ary. The darkening air and the lightnings that now fla&s;hed along the horizon terrified Clara, but &s;he withheld the expre&s;&s;ion of her fear in con&s;ideration of her father. A peal of thunder which &s;eemed to &s;hake the earth to its foundations, and was reverbe|rated in tremendous echoes from the cliffs, bur&s;t over their heads, Clara's hor&s;e took fright at the &s;ound, and &s;etting off, hurried her with amazing velocity down the mountain towards the lake, which wa&s;hed its foot. The agony of La Luc, who viewed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> progre&s;s in the horrible expectation of &s;eeing her da&s;hed do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the precipice that bordered the road, is not to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Clara kept her &s;eat, but terror had almo&s;t deprived her of &s;en&s;e. Her efforts to pre&s;erve her&s;elf was mechanical, for &s;he &s;carcely knew what &s;he did. The hor&s;e, however, carried her &s;afely almo&s;t to the foot of the mountain, but was making towards the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> when a gentleman who travelled along the road caught the bri|dle as the animal endeavoured to pa&s;s. The &s;udden &s;topping of the hor&s;e threw Clara to the ground, and, impatient of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;traint, the animal bur&s;t from the hand of the &s;tranger, and plun|ged into the lake. The violence of the fall deprived her of recollection; but while the &s;tranger endeavoured to &s;upport her, his &s;ervant ran to fetch water.</P>
<P>She &s;oon recovered, and unclo&s;ing her eyes found her&s;elf i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the arm of a chevalier, who appeared to &s;upport her with dif|ficulty.

<PB N="87" REF="029379_0123_0FE08D9947960058">
to thank him for his kindne&s;s when La Luc and Adeline came up. The terror impre&s;&s;ed on her father's features was perceived by Clara; languid as &s;he was, &s;he tried to rai&s;e her&s;elf, and &s;aid, with a faint &s;mile, which betrayed, in&s;tead of di&s;gui&s;ing her &s;ufferings, "Dear Sir, I am not hurt." Her pale countenance and the blood that trinkled down her cheek contradicted her words. But La Luc, to whom terror had &s;ugge&s;ted the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible evil, now rejoiced to hear her &s;peak; he recalled &s;ome pre&s;ence of mind, and while Adeline applied her &s;alts, he cha&s;ed her temples.</P>
<P>When &s;he revived &s;he told him how much &s;he was obliged to the &s;tranger. La Luc endeavoured to expre&s;s his gratitude; but the former interrupting him, begged he might be &s;pared the pain of receiving thanks for having followed only an impul&s;e of common humanity.</P>
<P>They were now not far from Leloncourt; but the evening was almo&s;t &s;hut in, and the thunder murmured deeply among the hills. La Luc was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed how to convey Clara home.</P>
<P>In endeavouring to rai&s;e her from the ground, the &s;tranger betrayed &s;uch evident &s;ymptoms of pain, that La Luc inquired concerning it. The &s;udden jerk which the hor&s;e had given the arm of the chevalier, in e&s;caping from his hold, had violently &s;prained his &s;houlder, and rendered his arm almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s. The pain was exqui&s;ite, and La Luc, who&s;e fears for his daughter were now &s;ub&s;iding, was &s;hocked at the circum&s;tance, and pre&s;&s;ed the &s;tranger to accompany him to the village, where relief might be ob|tained. He accepted the invitation, and Clara, being at length placed on a hor&s;e led by her father, was conducted to the chateau.</P>
<P>When Madame, who had been looking out for La Luc &s;ome time, perceived the cavalcade approaching, &s;he was alarmed, and her apprehen&s;ions were confirmed when &s;he &s;aw the &s;ituation of her neice. Clara was carried into the hou&s;e. And La Luc would have &s;ent for a &s;urgeon, but there was none within &s;eve|ral leagues of the village, neither were there any of the phy&s;ical profe&s;&s;ion within the &s;ame di&s;tance. Clara was a&s;&s;i&s;ted to her chamber by Adeline, and Madame La Luc undertook to exam|ine the wounds. The re&s;ult re&s;tored peace to the family; for though &s;he was much brui&s;ed, &s;he had e&s;caped material injury; a flight contu&s;ion on the forehead had occa&s;ioned the blood&s;hed which at fir&s;t alarmed La Luc. Madame undertook to re&s;tore her neice in a few days with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a bal&s;am compo&s;ed by her&s;elf, on the virtues of which &s;he de&s;canted with great elo|quence, till La Luc interrupted her by reminding her of the condition of her patient.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="029379_0124_0FE08D9DE4EDCFC8">Madame having bathed Clara's brui&s;es, and given her a cor|dial of incomparable efficacy, left her, and Adeline watched in the chamber of her friend till &s;he retired to her own for the night.</P>
<P>La Luc, who&s;e &s;pirits had &s;uffered much perturbation, was now tranquillized by the report his &s;i&s;ter made of Clara. He introduced the &s;tranger, and having mentioned the accident he had met with, de&s;ired that he might have immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Madame ha&s;tened to her clo&s;et, and it is perhaps difficult to de|termine whether &s;he felt mo&s;t concern for the &s;ufferings of her gue&s;t, or plea&s;ure at the opportunity thus offered of di&s;playing her phy&s;ical &s;kill. However this might be, &s;he quitted the room with great alacrity, and very quickly returned with a phial con|taining her ine&s;timable bal&s;am, and having given the nece&s;&s;ary directions for the application of it, &s;he left the &s;tranger to the care of his &s;ervant.</P>
<P>La Luc in&s;i&s;ted that the chevalier, M. Verneuil, &s;hould not leave the chateau that night, and he very readily &s;ubmitted to be detained. His manners during the evening were as frank and engaging as the ho&s;pitality and gratitude of La Luc were &s;incere, and they &s;oon entered into intere&s;ting conver&s;ation. M. Verneuil conver&s;ed like a man who had &s;een much, and thought more, and if he di&s;covered any prejudice in his opinions, it was evidently the prejudice of a mind which, &s;eeing objects through the medium of its own goodne&s;s, tinges them with the hue of its predominant quality. La Luc was much plea&s;ed, for in his retired &s;ituation he had not often an opportunity of receiving the plea&s;ure which re&s;ults from a communion of intelligent minds. He found that M. Verneuil had travelled. La Luc having a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions relative to England, they fell into di&s;cour&s;e concerning the national characters of the French and Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>"If it is the privilege of wi&s;dom," &s;aid M. Verneuil, "to look beyond happine&s;s, I own I had rather be without it. When we ob&s;erve the Engli&s;h, their laws, writings, and conver&s;ations, and at the &s;ame time mark their countenances, manners, and the frequency of &s;uicide among them, we are apt to believe that wi&s;dom and happine&s;s are incompatible. If, on the other hand, we turn to their neighbours, the French, and &s;ee <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be remembered that this was &s;aid in the &s;eventeenth century.</NOTE> their wretched policy, their &s;parking, but &s;ophi&s;tical di&s;cour&s;e, frivolous occupa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions, and, withal, their gay animated air, we &s;hall be compelled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o acknowledge that happine&s;s and folly too often dwell together."</P>
<P>"It is the end of wi&s;dom," &s;aid La Luc, "to attain happi|ne&s;s, and I can hardly dignify that conduct or cour&s;e of think|ing
<PB N="89" REF="029379_0124_0FE08D9DE4EDCFC8">
which tends to mi&s;ery with the name of wi&s;dom. By this rule, perhaps, the folly, as we term it, of the French, de&s;erves, &s;ince its effect is happine&s;s, to be called wi&s;dom. That airy thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, which &s;eems alike to contemn reflection and an|ticipation, produces all the effect of it without reducing its &s;ub|jects to the mortification of philo&s;ophy. But in truth wi&s;dom is an exertion of mind to &s;ubdue folly; and as the happine&s;s of the French is le&s;s the con&s;equence of mind than of con&s;titution, it de&s;erves not the honours of wi&s;dom."</P>
<P>Di&s;cour&s;ing on the variety of opinions that are daily formed on the &s;ame conduct, La Luc ob&s;erved how much that which is commonly called opinion is the re&s;ult of pa&s;&s;ion and temper.</P>
<P>"True," &s;aid M. Verneuil, "there is a tone of thought, as there is a key note in mu&s;ic, that leads all its weaker affections. Thus where the powers of judging may be equal, the di&s;po&s;ition to judge is different, and the actions of men are at lea&s;t but too often arraigned by whim and caprice, by partial vanity and the humour of the moment."</P>
<P>Here La Luc took occa&s;ion to reprobate the conduct of tho&s;e writers, who, by &s;hewing the dark &s;ide only of human nature, and by dwelling on the evils only which are incident to hu|manity, have &s;ought to degrade man in his own eyes, and to make him di&s;contented with life. "What &s;hould we &s;ay of a painter," continued La Luc, "who collected in his piece ob|jects of a black hue only, who pre&s;ented you with a black man, a black hor&s;e, a black dog, &amp;c. &amp;c. and tells you that his is a picture of nature, and that nature is black?" "'Tis true," you would reply, "the objects you exhibit do exi&s;t in nature, but they form a very &s;mall part of her works. You &s;ay that nature is black, and, to prove it, you have collected on your canva&s;s all the animals of this hue that exi&s;t. But you have forgot to paint the green earth, the blue &s;ky, the white man, and objects of all tho&s;e various hues with which creation abounds, and of which black is a very incon&s;iderable part."</P>
<P>The countenance of M. Verneuil lightened with peculiar an|imation during the di&s;cour&s;e of La Luc. "To think well of his nature," &s;aid he, "is nece&s;&s;ary to the dignity and happine&s;s of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n. There is a decent pride which becomes every mind and is congenial to virtue. That con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innate dig|nity, which &s;hews him the glory of his nature, will be his be&s;t protection from the meanne&s;s of vice. Where this con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s is wanting," continued M. Verneuil, "there can be no &s;en&s;e of moral honour, and con&s;equently none of the higher
<PB N="90" REF="029379_0125_0FE08DAAEBEEB828">
principles of action. What can be expected of him who &s;ays, it is his nature to be mean and &s;elfi&s;h? Or who can doubt that he who thinks thus, thinks from the experience of his own heart, from the tendency of his own inclinations? Let it always be remembered, that he who would per&s;uade men to be good ought to &s;hew them that they are great."</P>
<P>"You &s;peak," &s;aid La Luc, "with the hone&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m of a virtuous mind; and in obeying the impul&s;e of your heart, you utter the truths of philo&s;ophy: and, tru&s;t me, a bad heart and a <HI>truly</HI> philo&s;ophic head has never yet been united in the &s;ame individual. Vicious inclinations not only corrupt the heart, but the under&s;tanding, and thus lead to fal&s;e rea&s;oning. Virtue only is on the &s;ide of truth."</P>
<P>"La Luc and his gue&s;t, mutually plea&s;ed with each other, entered upon the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;ubjects &s;o intere&s;ting to them both, that it was late before they parted for the night.</P>

<P>REPOSE had &s;o much re&s;tored Clara, that when Adeline, anxious to know how &s;he did, went early in the morning to her chamber, &s;he found her already ri&s;en, and ready to attend the family at breakfa&s;t. Mon&s;ieur Verneuil ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eared al&s;o, but his looks betrayed a want of re&s;t, and indeed, he had &s;uffered dur|ing the night a degree of angui&s;h from his arm, which it was an effort of &s;ome re&s;olution to endure in &s;ilence. It was now &s;welled and &s;omewhat inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">med, and this might in &s;ome degree be attributed to the effect of Madame La Luc's bal&s;am, who&s;e re&s;torative qualities had for once failed. The whole family &s;ympathi&s;ed with his &s;ufferings, and Madame at the reque&s;t of M. Verneuil abandoned her bal&s;am, and &s;ub&s;tituted an emol|lient fomentation.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="029379_0125_0FE08DAAEBEEB828">From an application of this he in a &s;hort time, found an abatement of the pain, and returned to the breakfa&s;t table with greater compo&s;ure. The happine&s;s which La Luc felt at &s;eeing his daughter in &s;afety was very apparent, but the warmth of his gratitude towards her pre&s;erver he found it difficult to expre&s;s. Clara &s;poke the genuine emotions of her heart with artle&s;s, but mode&s;t, energy, and te&s;tified &s;incere concern for the &s;ufferings which &s;he had occa&s;ioned M. Verneuil.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure received from the company of his gue&s;t, and the con&s;ideration of the e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices he had rendered him, co-operated with the natural ho&s;pitality of La Luc, and he pre&s;|&s;ed M. Verneuil to remain &s;ome time at the chateau&mdash;"I can never repay the &s;ervices you have done me," &s;aid La Luc "yet I &s;eek to increa&s;e my obligations to you by reque&s;ting you will prolong your vi&s;it, and thus allow me an opportunity of culti|vating your acquaintance."</P>
<P>M. Verneuil, who at the time he met La Luc was travelling from Geneva to a di&s;tant part of Savoy, merely for the purpo&s;e of viewing the country, being now delighted with his ho&s;t and with every thing around him, willingly accepted the invitation. In this circum&s;tance prudence concurred with inclination, for to have pur&s;ued his journey on hor&s;eback, in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation would have been dang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rous, if not impracticable.</P>
<P>The morning was &s;pent in conver&s;ation, in which M. Ver|neuil di&s;played a mind enriched with ta&s;te, enlightened by &s;ci|ence and enlarged by ob&s;ervation. The &s;ituation of the cha|teau and the features of the &s;urrounding &s;cenery charmed him, and in the evening he found him&s;elf able to walk with La Luc and explore the beauties of this romantic region. As they pa&s;|&s;ed through the village, the &s;alutations of the pea&s;ants, in whom love and re&s;pect were equally blended, and their eager inquir|ies after Clara, bore te&s;timony to the character of La Luc, while his countenance expre&s;&s;ed a &s;erene &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erving and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their love.&mdash; "I live &s;urrounded by my children," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, turning to M. Verneuil, who had noticed their eagerne&s;s, "for &s;uch I con&s;ider my pari&s;hioners. In di&s;charging the duties of my of|fice, I am repaid not only by my own con&s;cience, but by their gratitude. There is a luxury in ob&s;erving their &s;imple and hon|e&s;t love, which I would not exchange for any thing the world calls ble&s;&s;ings."</P>
<P>"Yet the world, Sir, would call the plea&s;ures of which you &s;peak romantic," &s;aid M. Verneuil; "for to be &s;en&s;ible of this

M. Verneuil often &s;topped in raptures, to ob&s;erve and point out the &s;ingular beauties it exhibited, while La Luc, plea&s;ed with the delight his friend expre&s;&s;ed, &s;urveyed with more than u&s;ual &s;at|isfaction the objects which had &s;o often charmed him before. But there was a tender melancholy in the tone of his voice and his countenance which aro&s;e from the recollection of having of|ten traced tho&s;e &s;cenes, and partook of the plea&s;ure they in&s;pir|ed, with her who had long &s;ince bade them an eternal farewell.</P>
<P>They pre&s;ently quitted the lake and, winding up a &s;teep a&s;cent between the woods, came after an hour's walk, to a green &s;ummit, which appeared, among the &s;avage rocks that environed it, like the blo&s;&s;om on the thorn. It was a &s;pot formed for &s;olita|ry delight, in&s;piring that &s;oothing tenderne&s;s &s;o dear to the feel|ing mind, and which calls back to memory the images of pa&s;&s;|ed regret, &s;oftened by di&s;tance and endeared by frequent reco|lection. Wild &s;hrubs grew from the crivices of the rocks be|neath, and the high trees of pine and ceder that waved above, afforded a melancholy and romantic &s;hade. The &s;ilence of the &s;cene was interrupted only by the breeze, as it rolled over the woods, and by the &s;olitary notes of the birds that inhabited the cliffs.</P>
<P>From this point the eye commanded an entire view of tho&s;e maje&s;tic and &s;ublime Alps, who&s;e a&s;pect fills the &s;oul with emo|tions of inde&s;cribable awe, and &s;eems to lift it to a nobler na|ture. The village, and the chateau of La Luc appeared in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the mountains, a peaceful retreat from the &s;torms that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed on their tops. All the faculties of M. Verneuil were ab&s;orbed in admiration, and he was for &s;ome time quite &s;ilent; at length, bur&s;ting into a rhap&s;ody, he turned, and would have addre&s;&s;ed La Luc, when he perceived him at a di&s;tance lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing again&s;t a ru&s;tic urn, over which drooped, in beautiful luxu|riance, the weeping willow.</P>
<P>As he approached, La Luc quitted his po&s;ition, and advan|ced to meet him, while M. Verneuil inquired upon what oc|ca&s;ion the urn had been erected. La Luc, unable to an&s;wer, pointed to it, and walked &s;ilently away, and M. Verneuil, ap|proaching the urn, read the following in&s;cription.</P>
<Q><PB N="93" REF="029379_0126_0FE08EA488B6D1D8">TO THE MEMORY OF CLARA LA LUC. THIS URN IS ERECTED ON THE SPOT WHICH SHE LOVED, IN TESTIMONY OF THE AFFECTION OF A HUSBAND.</Q>
<P>M. Verneuil now comprehended the whole, and feeling for his friend, was hurt that he had noticed this monument of his grief. He rejoined La Luc, who was &s;tanding on the point of the eminence contemplating the land&s;cape below with an air more placid, and touched with the &s;weetne&s;s of piety and re|&s;ignation. He perceived that M. Verneuil was &s;omewhat di&s;|concerted, and he &s;ought to remove his unea&s;ine&s;s. "You will con&s;ider it," &s;aid he, "as a mark of my e&s;teem that I have brought you to this &s;pot. It is never prophaned by the pre&s;ence of the unfeeling. They would deride the faithfulne&s;s of an at|tachment which has &s;o long &s;urvived its object, and which in their own brea&s;ts, would quickly have been lo&s;t amid&s;t the di&s;|&s;ipation of general &s;ociety. I have cheri&s;hed in my heart the remembrance of a woman who&s;e virtues claimed all my love: I have cheri&s;hed it as a trea&s;ure to which I could withdraw from temporary cares and vexations, in the certainty of finding a &s;oothing, though melancholy comfort."</P>
<P>La Luc pau&s;ed. M. Verneuil expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ympathy he felt, but he knew the &s;acredne&s;s of &s;orrow, and &s;oon relap&s;ed into &s;ilence, "One of the brighte&s;t hopes of a future &s;tate," re|&s;umed La Luc, "is, that we &s;hall meet again tho&s;e whom we have loved upon earth. And perhaps our happine&s;s may be per|mitted to con&s;i&s;t very much in the &s;ociety of our friends, puri|fied from the fralities of mortality, with the finer affections more &s;weetly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and with the faculties of mind infinitely more cle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and enlarged. We &s;hall then be enabled to comprehend &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which are too va&s;t for human conception; to comprehend, perhaps, the &s;ublimity of that Deity who fir&s;t called us into be|ing. The&s;e views of futurity, my friend, elevete us above the evils of this world, and &s;eem to communicate to us a portion of the nature we contemplate."</P>
<P>"Call them not the illu&s;ions of a vi&s;ionary brain," proceeded La Luc: "I tru&s;t in their reality. Of this I am certain, that whether they are illu&s;ions or not, a faith in them ought to be cheri&s;hed for the comfort it brings to the heart, and reverenced
<PB N="94" REF="029379_0127_0FE08DAFDF4FDE80">
for the dignity it imparts to the mind. Such feelings make a happy and important part of our belief in a future exi&s;tence; they give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gy to virtue, and &s;tability to principle."</P>
<P>"This," &s;aid M. Verneuil, "is what I have often felt, and what every ingenuous mind mu&s;t acknowledge."</P>
<P>La Luc and M. Verneuil continued in conver&s;ation till the &s;un had left the &s;cene. The mountains, darkened by twilight, a&s;&s;umed a &s;ublimer a&s;pect, while the tops of &s;ome of the highe&s;t Alps were yet illuminated by the &s;un's rays, and formed a &s;trik|ing contra&s;t to the &s;hadowy ob&s;curity of the world below&punc; As they de&s;cended through the woods, and traver&s;ed the margin of the lake, the &s;tillne&s;s and &s;olemnity of the hour diffu&s;ed a pen&s;ive &s;weetne&s;s over their minds, and &s;unk them into &s;ilence.</P>
<P>They found &s;upper &s;pread, as was u&s;ual, in the hall, of which the windows opened upon a garden, where the flowers might be &s;aid to yield their fragrance in gratitude to the refre&s;hing dews. The windows were embowered with eglantine and other &s;weet &s;hrubs, which hung in wild luxuriance around, and formed a beautiful and &s;imple docoration. Clara and Adeline loved to pa&s;s the evening in this hall, where they had acquired the fir&s;t rudiments of a&s;tronomy and from which they had a wide view of the heavens. La Luc pointed out to them the planets and the fixed &s;tars, explained their laws, and from thence taking oc|ca&s;ion to mingle moral with &s;cientific in&s;truction, would of ten a&s;cend towards that great fir&s;t cau&s;e, who&s;e nature &s;oar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be|yond the gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of human comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>"No &s;tudy," he would &s;ometimes &s;ay, "&s;o much enlarged the mind, or impre&s;&s;es it with &s;o &s;ublime an idea of the Deity, as that of a&s;tronomy. When the imagination lanches into the regions of &s;pace, and contemplates the innumerable worlds which are &s;cattered through it, we are lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment and awe. This globe appears as a ma&s;s of attoms in the immen&s;ity of the univer&s;e, and man a mere <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ect. Yet how wonderful! that man, who&s;e frame is &s;o diminutive in the &s;cale of beings, &s;hould have powers which &s;purn the narrow boundaries of time and place, &s;oar beyond the &s;phere of his exi&s;tence, penetrate the &s;e|cret laws of nature, and calculate their progre&s;&s;ive effects."</P>
<P>"Oh! how expre&s;&s;ively does this prove the &s;pirituality o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our being! Let the materiali&s;t con&s;ider it, and blu&s;h that he has ever doubted.</P>
<P>In this hall the whole family now met at &s;upper, and during the remainder of the evening the conver&s;ation turned upon gen|eral &s;ubjects in which Clara joined in mode&s;t and judicious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="95" REF="029379_0127_0FE08DAFDF4FDE80">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arks. La Luc had taught her to familiarize her mind to rea|&s;oning, and had accu&s;tomed her to deliver her &s;entiments freely&punc; &s;he &s;poke them with a &s;implicity extremely engaging, and which conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nced her hearers that the love of knowledge, not the vanity of talking, induced her to conver&s;e. M. Verneuil evidently en|deavoured to draw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orth her &s;entiments, and Clara, intere&s;ted by the &s;ubjects he introduced, a &s;tranger to affection, and plea&s;ed with the opinions he expre&s;&s;ed, an&s;wered them with frankne&s;s and animation. They retired mutually plea&s;ed with each other.</P>
<P>M. Varneuil was about &s;ix and thirty; his figure manly, his countenance frank and engaging. A quick penetrating eye, who&s;e fire was &s;oftened by benevolence, di&s;clo&s;ed the chief traits of his character; he was quick to di&s;cern, but generous to ex|cu&s;e, the follies of mankind; and while no one more &s;en&s;ibly felt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n injury none more readily accepted the conce&s;&s;ion of an enemy.</P>
<P>He was by birth a Frenchman. A fortune lately devolved to him, had enabled him to execute the plan which his active and inqui&s;itive mind had &s;ugge&s;ted, of viewing the mo&s;t re|markable parts of the continent. He was peculiarly &s;u&s;ceptible of the beautiful and &s;ublime in nature. To &s;uch a ta&s;te, Swit|zerland and the adjacent country was, of all others, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, and he found the &s;cenery it exhibited infinitely &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing all that his glowing imagination had painted; he &s;aw with the eye of a painter, and felt with the rapture of a poet.</P>
<P>In the habitation of La Luc he met with the ho&s;pitality, the frankne&s;s, and the &s;implicity, &s;o characteri&s;tic of the country: In his venerable ho&s;t he &s;aw the &s;trength of philo&s;ophy united with the fine&s;t tenderne&s;s of humanity: a philo&s;ophy which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght him to correct his feelings, not to annihilate them; in Clara, the bloom of beauty, with the mo&s;t perfect &s;implicity of heart; and in Adeline all the charms of elegance and grace, with a genius de&s;erving of the highe&s;t culture. In this family picture, the goodne&s;s of Madame La Luc was not unperceived or forgotten. The cheerfulne&s;s and harmony that reigned within the chateau was delightful; but the philanthropy which, flow|ing from the heart of the pa&s;tor, was diffu&s;ed through the whole village, and united the inhabitants in the &s;weet and firm bonds of &s;ocial compact, was divine. The beauty of its &s;ituation con|&s;pired with the&s;e circum&s;tances to make Leloncourt &s;eem almo&s;t a Paradi&s;e. M. Verneuil &s;ighed that he mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon quit it. "I ought to &s;eek no farther," &s;aid he, "for here wi&s;dom and happine&s;s dwell together."</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="029379_0128_0FE08DBD8267DC28">The admiration was reciprocal; La Luc and his family found them&s;elves much intere&s;ted in M. Verneuil, and looked forward to the time of his departure with regret. So warmly they pre&s;&s;ed him to prolong his vi&s;it, and &s;o powerfully his own inclinations &s;econded theirs, that he accepted the invitation. La Luc omit|ted no circum&s;tance which might contribute to the amu&s;ement of his gue&s;t, who, having in a few days recovered the u&s;e of his arm, they made &s;everal excur&s;ions among the mountains. Adeline and Clara, whom the care of Madame had re&s;tored to her u&s;ual health, were generally of the party.</P>
<P>After &s;pending a week at the chateau, M. Verneuil bade adieu to La Luc and his family; they parted with mutual re|gret, and the former promi&s;ed that when he returned to Gene|va, he would take Leloncourt in his way. As he &s;aid this, Adeline, who had for &s;ome time ob&s;erved, with much alarm, La Luc's declining health, looked mournfully on his counten|ance, and uttered a &s;ecret prayer that he might live to receive the vi&s;it of M. Verneuil.</P>
<P>Madame was the only per&s;on who did not lament his depar|ture, &s;he &s;aw that the efforts of her brother to entertain his gue&s;t were more than his pre&s;ent &s;tate of health would admit of, and &s;he rejoiced in the quiet that would now return to him.</P>
<P>But this quiet brought La Luc no re&s;pite from the illne&s;s; the fatigue he had &s;uffered in his late excur&s;ions &s;eemed to have in|crea&s;ed his di&s;order, which in a &s;hort time a&s;&s;umed the a&s;pect of a con&s;umption. Yielding to the &s;olicitations of his family, he went to Geneva for advice, and was there recommended to try the air of Nice.</P>
<P>The journey thither, however, was of con&s;iderable length, and believing his life to be very precarious, he he&s;itated whether to go. He was al&s;o unwilling to leave the duty of his pari&s;h unperformed for &s;o long a period as his health might require&punc; but this was an objection which would not have withheld him from Nice, had his faith in the climate been equal to that of his phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>His pari&s;hioners felt the life of their pa&s;tor to be of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence to them. It was a general cau&s;e, and they te&s;tified at once his worth, and their &s;en&s;e of it, by going in a body to &s;olicit him to leave them. He was much affected by this in&s;tance of their attachment. Such a proof of regard, joined with the entreaties of his own family, and a con&s;ideration that for their &s;akes it was a duty to endeavour to prolong his life, was too powerful to be with&s;tood, and he determined to &s;et out for Italy.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="029379_0128_0FE08DBD8267DC28">It was &s;ettled that Clara and Adeline, who&s;e health La Luc thought required change of air and &s;cene, &s;hould accompany him, attended by the faithful Peter.</P>
<P>On the morning of his departure, a large body of his pari&s;h|ioners a&s;&s;embled round the door to bid him farewell. It was an affecting &s;cene; they might meet no more. At length, wiping the tears from his eyes, La Luc &s;aid, "Let us tru&s;t in God, my friends; he has power to heal all di&s;orders both of body and mind. We &s;hall meet again, if not in this world, I hope in a better. Let our conduct be &s;uch as to en&s;ure that better."</P>
<P>The &s;obs of his people prevented any reply. There was &s;carce|ly a dry eye in the village; for there was &s;carcely an inhabitant of it that was not now a&s;&s;embled in the pre&s;ence of La Luc. He &s;hook hands with them all, "Farewell, my friends," &s;aid he, "we &s;hall meet again." "God grant we may," &s;aid they with one voice of fervent petition.</P>
<P>Having mounted his hor&s;e, and Clara and Adeline being ready, they took a la&s;t leave of Madame La Luc, and quitted the chateau. The people unwilling to leave La Luc, the greater part of them accompanied him to &s;ome di&s;tance from the village. As he moved &s;lowly on he ca&s;t a la&s;t lingering look at his little home, where he had &s;pent &s;o many peaceful years, and which he now gazed on, perhaps for the la&s;t time, and tears ro&s;e to his eyes; but he checked them. Every &s;cene of the adjacent coun|try called up, as he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ome tender remembrance. He looked towards the &s;pot con&s;ecrated to the memory of his decea&s;|ed wife; the dewy vapours of the morning veiled it. La Luc felt the di&s;appointment more deeply, perhaps, than rea&s;on could ju&s;tify; but tho&s;e who know from experience how much the imagination loves to dwell on any object, however remotely con|nected with that of our tenderne&s;s, will feel with him. This was an object round which the affections of La Luc had &s;ettled them&s;elves; it was a memorial to the eye, and the view of it awakened more forcibly in the memory every tender idea that could a&s;&s;ociate with the primary &s;ubject of his regard. In &s;uch ca&s;es fancy gives to the illu&s;ions of &s;trong affection, the &s;tamp of re|ality, and they are cheri&s;hed by the heart with romantic fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>His people accompanied him for near a mile from the vil|lage, and could &s;carcely then be prevailed on to leave him; at length he once more bade them farewell, and went on his way, followed by their prayers and ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>La Luc and his little party travelled &s;lowly on, &s;unk in pen|&s;ive &s;ilence&mdash;a &s;ilence too plea&s;ingly &s;ad to be &s;oon relinqui&s;h|ed,
<PB N="98" REF="029379_0129_0FE08DC2843B38B0">
and which they indulged without fear of interruption. The &s;olitary grandeur of the &s;cenes through which they pa&s;&s;ed, and the &s;oothing murmur of the pines that waved above, aided this &s;oft luxury of meditation.</P>
<P>They proceeded by ea&s;y &s;tages; and after travelling for &s;ome days among the romantic mountains and green vallies of Piedmont, they entered the rich country of Nice. The gay and luxuriant views which now opened upon the travellers as they wound among the hills, appeared like &s;cenes of fairy en|chantment, or tho&s;e produced by the lonely vi&s;ions of the Po|ets. While the &s;piral &s;ummits of the mountains exhibited the &s;nowy &s;everity of winter, the pine, the cypre&s;s, the olive and the myrtle &s;haded their &s;ides with the green tints of &s;pring, and groves of orange, lemon, and citron, &s;pread over their feet the full glow of autumn. As they advanced the &s;cenery became &s;till more diver&s;ified; and at length, between the receding heights, Adeline caught a glimp&s;e of the di&s;tant waters of the Mediterranean, fading into the blue and cloudle&s;s horizon. She had never till now &s;een the ocean; and this tran&s;ient view of it rou&s;ed her imagination, and made her watch impatiently for a nearer pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>It was towards the clo&s;e of day when the travellers winding round an abrupt projection of that range of Alps which crowns the amphitheatre that environs Nice, looked down upon the green hills that &s;tretch to the &s;hores, on the city, and its an|cient ca&s;tle, and on the wide waters of the Mediterranean; with the mountains of Cor&s;ica in the farthe&s;t di&s;tance. Such a &s;weep of &s;ea and land, &s;o varied with the gay the magnificent, and the awful, would have fixed an eye in admiration:&mdash;for Adeline and Clara novelty and enthu&s;ia&s;m added their charms to the pro&s;pect. The &s;oft and &s;alubrious air &s;eemed to welcome La Luc to this &s;miling region, and the &s;erene atmo&s;phere to promi&s;e invariable &s;ummer. They at length de&s;cended upon the little plain where &s;tands the city of Nice, and which was the mo&s;t exten&s;ive piece of level ground they had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince they entered the country. Here in the bo&s;om of the mountains, &s;heltered from the north and the ea&s;t, where the we&s;tern gales alone &s;eemed to breathe, all the blooms of &s;pring and the riches of autumn were united. Trees of myrtle bordered the road, which wound among groves of orange, lemon and bergamot who&s;e delicious fragrance come to the &s;en&s;e mingled with the breath of ro&s;es and carnations that blo&s;&s;omed in their &s;hade. The gently &s;welling hills that ro&s;e from the plain were covered
<PB N="99" REF="029379_0129_0FE08DC2843B38B0">
with vines, and crowned with cypre&s;&s;es, olives and date trees; beyond, there appeared the &s;weep of lofty mountains whence the travellers had de&s;cended, and whence ro&s;e the little river Paglion, &s;woln by the &s;nows that melt on their &s;ummits, and which, after meandering through the plain, wa&s;hes the walls of Nice, where it falls into the Mediterranean. In this blooming region, Adeline ob&s;erved that the countenances of the pea&s;ants, meagre and di&s;contented, formed, a melancholy contra&s;t, to the face of the country, and &s;he lamented again the effects of an ar|bitrary government, where the bounties of nature, which were de&s;igned for all, are monopolized by a few, and the many are &s;uffered to &s;tarve tantalized by &s;urrounding plenty.</P>
<P>The city lo&s;t much of its enchantment on a nearer approach: its narrow &s;treets and &s;habby hou&s;es but ill an&s;wered the ex|pectation which a di&s;tant view of its ramparts and its harbour gay with ve&s;&s;els &s;eemed to authori&s;e. The appearance of the inn at which La Luc now alighted did not contribute to &s;often his di&s;appointment; but if he was &s;upri&s;ed to find &s;uch indif|ferent accommodation at the inn of a town celebrated as the re|&s;ort of valetudinarians, he was &s;till more &s;o when he learned the difficulty of procuring furni&s;hed lodgings.</P>
<P>After much &s;earch he procured apartments in a &s;mall but plea&s;ant hou&s;e, &s;ituated a little way out of the town: it had a garden, and a terrace which overlooked the &s;ea, and was di&s;|tingui&s;hed by an air of neatne&s;s very unu&s;ual in the hou&s;es of Nice. He agreed to board with the family, who&s;e table like|wi&s;e accommodated a gentleman and lady, their lodgers, and thus he became a temporary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">habitant of this charming climate.</P>
<P>On the following morning Adeline ro&s;e at an early hour, eager to indulge the new and &s;ublime emotion with which a view of the ocean in&s;pired her, and walked with Clara towards the hills that afforded a more exten&s;ive pro&s;pect. They pur&s;u|ed their way for &s;ome time between high embowering banks, till they arrived at an eminence, whence
<Q>"Heaven, earth, ocean, &s;mil'd!"</Q></P>
<P>They &s;at down on a rock, over&s;hadowed by lofty palm-trees, to contemplate at lei&s;ure the magnificent &s;cene. The &s;un was ju&s;t emerged from the &s;ea, over which his rays &s;hed a flood of light, and darted a thou&s;and brilliant tints on the vapours that a&s;cended the horizon, and floated there in light clouds, leaving the bo&s;om of the waters below clear as chry&s;tal, except where the white &s;urges were &s;een to beat upon the rocks; and di&s;|covering the di&s;tant &s;ails of the fi&s;hing boats, and the far di&s;tant

highlands of Cor&s;ica, tinted with aetherial blue. Clara, after &s;ome time, drew forth her pencel, but threw it a&s;ide in de&s;pair. Adeline as they returned home threw a romantic glen, when her &s;en&s;es were no longer ab&s;orbed in the contemplation of this grand &s;cenery, and when its images floated on her memory, on|ly, in &s;oftened colours, repeated the following lines:

<P>La Luc in his walks met with &s;ome &s;en&s;ible and agreeable companions, who like him&s;elf came to Nice in &s;earch of health. Of the&s;e he &s;oon formed a &s;mall but plea&s;ant &s;ociety, among whom was a Frenchman, who&s;e wild manners marked with a deep and intere&s;ting melancholy, had particularly attracted La Luc. He very &s;eldom mentioned him&s;elf, or any circum&s;tance that might lead to a knowledge of his family, but on other &s;ubjects conver&s;ed with frankne&s;s and much intelligence. La Luc had frequently invited him to his lodgings, but he had al|ways declined the invitation, and this in a manner &s;o gentle as to di&s;arm di&s;plea&s;ure, and convince La Luc that his refu&s;al was the con&s;equence of a certain dejection of mind which made him reluctant to meet other &s;trangers.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription which La Luc had given of this foreigner had excited the curio&s;ity of Clara; and the &s;ympathy which the unfortunate feel for each other called forth the commi&s;era|tion of Adeline; for that he was unfortunate &s;he could not doubt. On their return from an evening walk La Luc pointed out the chevalier, and quickened his pace to overtake him.
<PB N="101" REF="029379_0130_0FE08DCE9838CA58">
Adeline was for a moment impelied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> follow, but delicacy checked her &s;teps, &s;he knew how painful the pre&s;ence of a &s;tran|ger often is to a wounded mind, and forbore to intrude her&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lf on his notice for the &s;ake of only &s;atisfying an idle curio&s;ity. She turned therefore, into another path; but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> delicacy which now prevented the meeting, accident in a few days defeated, and La Luc introduced the &s;tranger. Adeline received him with a &s;oft &s;mile, but endeavoured to re&s;train the expre&s;&s;ion of pity which her features had involuntarily a&s;&s;umed; &s;he wi&s;hed him not to know that &s;he ob&s;erved he was unhappy.</P>
<P>After this interview he no longer rejected the invitations of La Luc, but made him frequent vi&s;its, and often accompanied Adeline and Clara in their rambles. The mild and &s;en&s;ible conver&s;ation of the former &s;eemed to &s;ooth his mind, and in her pre&s;ence, he frequently conver&s;ed with a degree of anima|tion which La Luc till then had not ob&s;erved in him. Ade|line too derived from the &s;imilarity of their ta&s;te, and his intel|ligent conver&s;ation, a degree of &s;atisfaction which contributed, with the compa&s;&s;ion his dejection in&s;pired, to win her conver&s;ation, and &s;he conver&s;ed with an ea&s;y frankne&s;s rather unu&s;ual to her.</P>
<P>His vi&s;its &s;oon became more frequent. He walked with La Luc and his family; he attended them on their little excur|&s;ions to view tho&s;e magnificent remains of Roman antiquity which enrich the neighbourhood of Nice. When the ladies &s;at at home and worked, he enlivened the hours by reading to them, and they had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve his &s;pirits &s;omewhat relieved from the heavy melancholy that had oppre&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>M. Amand was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic. Clara had not forgot to bring her beloved lute: he would &s;ometimes &s;trike the chords in the mo&s;t &s;weet and mournful &s;ymphonies, but ne|ver could be prevailed on to play. When Adeline or Clara played, he would &s;it in deep reverie, and lo&s;t to every object around him, except when he fixed his eyes in mournful gaze on Adeline, and a &s;igh would &s;ometimes e&s;cape him.</P>
<P>One evening Adeline having excu&s;ed her&s;elf from accom|panying La Luc and Clara in a vi&s;it to a neighbouring family, &s;he returned to the terrace of the garden, which overlooked the &s;ea, and as &s;he viewed the tranquil &s;plendour of the &s;itting &s;un, and his glories reflected on the poli&s;hed &s;urface of the waves, &s;he touched the &s;trings of the lute in &s;ofte&s;t harmony, her voice accompanying it with words which &s;he had one day written af|ter having read that rich effu&s;ion of Shake&s;peare's genius, "A mid&s;ummer Night's dream."</P>

me."&mdash;His voice faultered, and he pau&s;ed. Adeline was &s;ilent. "The lute" he re&s;umed "was her favourite in&s;trument, and when you touched it with &s;uch melancholy expre&s;&s;ion, I &s;aw her very image before me. But alas! why do I di&s;tre&s;s you with a knowledge of my &s;orrows! &s;he is gone, and never to return! And you, Adeline&mdash;you"&mdash;He checked his &s;peech; and Adeline, turning on him a look of mournful regard, ob&s;erved a wildne&s;s in his eyes which alarmed her. "The&s;e recollections are too painful," &s;aid &s;he in a gentle voice; "let us return to the hou&s;e; M. La Luc is probably come home"&mdash;"O no!" replied M. Amand; "No&mdash;this breeze refre&s;hes me. How often at this hour have I talked with <HI>her,</HI> as I now talk with you!&mdash;Such were the &s;oft tones of her voice&mdash;&s;uch the ineffa|ble expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance."&mdash;Adeline interrupted him. "Let me beg of you to con&s;ider your health&mdash;this dewy air cannot be good for invalids." He &s;tood with his hands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and &s;eemed not to hear her. She took up the lute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> pa&s;&s;ed her fingers lightly over the chords. The &s;ounds recalled his &s;cattered &s;en&s;es: he rai&s;ed his eyes, and fixed them in a long un&s;ettled gaze upon hers. "Mu&s;t I leave you here?" &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling, and &s;tanding in an attitude to depart&mdash;"I entreat you to play again the air I heard ju&s;t now," &s;aid M. Amand in a hurried voice. "Certainly!" and &s;he immediately began to play. He leaned again&s;t a palm tree in an attitude of deep at|tention, and as the &s;ounds langui&s;hed on the air, his features gradually lo&s;t their wild expre&s;&s;ion, and he melted into tears. He continued to weep &s;ilently till the &s;ong concluded, and it was &s;ome time before he recovered his voice enough to &s;ay, "Adeline, I cannot thank you for this goodne&s;s. My mind has recovered its bias, you have &s;oothed a broken heart. Increa&s;e the kindne&s;s you have &s;hewn me by promi&s;ing never to mention what you have witne&s;&s;ed this evening, and I will endeavour never again to wound your &s;en&s;ibility by a &s;imilar offence."&mdash;Adeline gave the required promi&s;e; and M. Amand, pre&s;&s;ing her hand, with a melancholy &s;mile, hurried from the garden, and &s;he &s;aw him no more that night.</P>
<P>La Luc had been near a fortnight at Nice, and his health, in|&s;tead of amending, &s;eemed rather to decline, yet he wi&s;hed to make a longer experiment of the climate. The air, which failed to re&s;tore her venerable friend, revived Adeline, and the variety, and novelty of the &s;urrounding &s;cenes amu&s;ed her mind, though, &s;ince they could not oblite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate the memory of pa&s;t, or &s;uppre&s;s the pang of pre&s;ent affliction, they were ineffectual to

di&s;&s;ipate the &s;ick langour of melancholy. Company, by com|pelling her to withdraw her attention from the &s;ubject of her &s;orrow, afforded her tran&s;ient relief, but the violence of the ex|ertion generally left her more depre&s;&s;ed. It was in the &s;tillne&s;s of &s;olitude, in the tranquil ob&s;ervance of beautiful nature, that her mind recovered its tone, and indulging the pen&s;ive inclina|tion now become habitual to it, was &s;oothed and fortified. Of all the grand objects which nature had exhibited, the ocean in|&s;pired her with the mo&s;t &s;ublime admiration. She loved to wander alone on its &s;hores, and when &s;he could e&s;cape &s;o long from the duties or the forms of &s;ociety, &s;he would &s;it for hours on the beach watching the rolling waves, and li&s;tening to their dying murmur, till her &s;oftened fancy recalled long lo&s;t &s;cenes and re&s;tored the image of Theodore, when tears of de&s;pondency too often followed tho&s;e of pity and regret. But the&s;e vi&s;ions of memory, painful as they were, no longer excited that frenzy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> grief they formerly awakened in Savoy; the &s;harpne&s;s of mi&s;|ery was pa&s;&s;ed, though its heavy influence was not perhaps le&s;s powerful. To the&s;e &s;olitary indulgencies generally &s;ucceeded calmne&s;s, and what Adeline endeavoured to believe was re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>She u&s;ually ro&s;e early, and walked down to the &s;hore to en|joy, in the cool and &s;ilent hours of the morning, the cheering beauty of nature, and inhale the pure &s;ea-breeze. Every object then &s;miled in fre&s;h and lively colours. The blue &s;ea, the brilliant &s;ky, the di&s;tant fi&s;hing boats, with their white &s;ails and the voices of the fi&s;hermen borne at intervals on the air, were circum&s;tances which re-animated her &s;pirits and in one of her rambles yielding to that ta&s;te for poetry which had &s;eldom for|&s;aken her, &s;he repeated the following lines.</P>

<P>During &s;everal days &s;ucceeding that on which M. Amand had di&s;clo&s;ed the cau&s;e of his melancholy, he did not vi&s;it La Luc. At length Adeline met him in one of her &s;olitary ram|bles on the &s;hore. He was pale and dejected, and &s;eemed much agitated when he ob&s;erved her; &s;he therefore endeavoured to avoid him, but he advanced with quickened &s;teps and acco&s;ted her. He &s;aid it was his intention to leave Nice in a few days. "I have found no benefit from the climate," added M. Amand; "Alas! what climate can relieve the &s;ickne&s;s of the heart! I go to lo&s;e in the varieties of new &s;cenes the remembrance of pa&s;t happine&s;s; yet the effort is vain; I am every where equally re&s;tle&s;s and unhappy." Adeline tried to encourage him to hope much from time and change of place. "Time <HI>will</HI> blunt the &s;harpe&s;t edge of &s;orrow," &s;aid &s;he; "I know it from experi|ence." Yet while &s;he &s;poke, the tears in her eyes contradicted the a&s;&s;ertion of her lips. "You have been unhappy, Adeline!&mdash; Yes&mdash;I knew it from the fir&s;t. The &s;mile of pity which you gave me, a&s;&s;ured me that you knew what it was to &s;uffer." The de&s;ponding air with which he &s;poke renewed her apprehen&s;ion of a &s;cene &s;imilar to the one &s;he had lately witne&s;&s;ed, and &s;he changed the &s;ubject, but he &s;oon returned to it. "You bid me hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch from time! My wife! My dear wife!"&mdash;his tong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> faultered&mdash;"It is now many months &s;ince I lo&s;t her&mdash; yet the moment of her death &s;eems but as ye&s;terday." Adeline faintly &s;miled. "You can &s;carcely judge of the effect of time yet, you have much to hope for." He &s;hook his head. "But I am again intruding my misfortunes on your notice; forgive this perpetual egoti&s;m. There is a comfort in the pity of the good, &s;uch as nothing el&s;e can impart; this mu&s;t plead my excu&s;e; may you, Adeline, never want it. Ah! tho&s;e tears&mdash;" Adeline ha&s;tily dried them. M. Amand forbore to pre&s;s the &s;ubject, and immediately began to conver&s;e on indifferent topics. They returned towards the chateau, but La Luc being from home M. Amand took leave at the door. Adeline retired to her chamber, oppre&s;&s;ed by her own &s;orrows, and tho&s;e of her amiable friend.</P>
<P>Near three weeks had now elap&s;ed at Nice, during which the di&s;order of La Luc &s;eemed rather to increa&s;e than to abate, when his phy&s;ician very hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;ed the little hope he en|tertained
<PB N="108" REF="029379_0134_0FE08DEECC776418">
from the climate, and advi&s;ed him to try the effect of a &s;ea voyage, adding, that if the experiment failed, even the air of Montpellier appeared to him more likely to afford relief than that of Nice. La Luc received this di&s;intere&s;ted advice with a mixture of gratitude and di&s;appointment. The circum&s;tances which had made him reluctant to quit Savoy, rendered him yet more &s;o to protract his ab&s;cence, and increa&s;e his expen&s;es; but the ties of affection that bound him to his family, and the love of life, which &s;o &s;eldom leave, us, again prevailed over inferior con&s;iderations, and he determined to coa&s;t the Mediterranean as far as Languedoc, where, if the voyage did not an&s;wer his ex|pectations, he would land and proceed to Montpellier.</P>
<P>When M. Amand learned that La Luc de&s;igned to quit Nice in a few days, he determined not to leave it before him. Dur|ing this interval he had not &s;ufficient re&s;olution to deny him|&s;elf the frequent conver&s;ation of Adeline, though her pre&s;ence, by reminding him of his lo&s;t wife, gave him more pain than comfort. He was the &s;econd &s;on of a French gentleman of fam|ily, and had been married about a year to a lady to whom he had long been attached when &s;he died in her lying-in. The in|fant &s;oon followed its mother, and left the di&s;con&s;olate father abandoned to grief, which had preyed &s;o heavily on his health, that his phy&s;ician thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end him to Nice. From the air of Nice, however, he had derived no benefit, and he now determined to travel father into Italy, though he no lon|ger felt any intere&s;t in tho&s;e charming &s;cenes which in happier days, and with her whom he never cea&s;ed to lament, would have afforded him the highe&s;t degree of mental luxury&mdash;now he &s;ought only to e&s;cape from him&s;elf, or rather from the image of her who had once con&s;tituted his true&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>La Luc having laid his plan, hired a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, and in a few days embarked, with a &s;ick hope bidding adieu to the &s;hores of Italy and the towering Alps, and &s;eeking on a new element the health which had hitherto mocked his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>M. Amand took a melancholy leave of his new friends, whom he attended to the &s;ea &s;ide. When he a&s;&s;i&s;ted Adeline on board his heart was too full to &s;uffer him to &s;ay farewell; but he &s;tood long on the beach pur&s;uing with his eyes her cour&s;e over the waters, and waving his hands, till tears dimmid his &s;ight. The breeze wafted the ve&s;&s;el gently from the coa&s;t, and Adeline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her&s;elf &s;urrounded by the undulating waves of the ocean. The &s;hore appeared to recede, its mountains to le&s;&s;en, the gay colour of its land&s;cape to melt into each other, and in a &s;hort time the
<PB N="109" REF="029379_0134_0FE08DEECC776418">
figure of M. Amand was &s;een no more: the town of Nice, with its ca&s;tle and harbour, next faded away in di&s;tance, and the purple tint of the mountains was at length all that remained on the verge of the horizon. She &s;ighed as &s;he gazed, and her eyes filled with tears. "So vani&s;hed my pro&s;pect of happine&s;s," &s;aid &s;he; "and my future view is like the wa&s;te of waters that &s;urround me." Her heart was full, and &s;he retired from ob&s;er|vation to a remote part of the deck, where &s;he indulged her tears as &s;he watched the ve&s;&s;el cut its way through the liquid gla&s;s. The water was &s;o tran&s;parent that &s;he &s;aw the &s;un|beams playing at a con&s;iderable depth, and fi&s;h of various col|ours glance athwart the current. Innumerable marine plants &s;pread their vigorous leaves on the rocks below, and the rich|ne&s;s of their verdure formed a beautiful contra&s;t to the glow|ing &s;carlet of the coral that branched be&s;ide them.</P>
<P>The di&s;tant coa&s;t, at length, entirely di&s;appeared. Adeline gazed with an emotion the mo&s;t &s;ublime, on the boundle&s;s ex|pen&s;e of waters that &s;pread on all &s;ides: &s;he &s;eemed as if launched into a new world, the grandeur and immen&s;ity of the view a&s;toni&s;hed and overpowered her: for a moment &s;he doubted the truth of the compa&s;s, and believed it to be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the ve&s;&s;el to find its way over the pathle&s;s waters to any &s;hore. And when &s;he con&s;idered that a plank alone &s;e|parated her from death, a &s;en&s;ation of unmixed terror &s;uper&s;ed|ed that of &s;ublimity, and &s;he ha&s;tily turned her eyes from the pro&s;pect, and her thoughts from the &s;ubject.</P>

<P>As the &s;hadows thickened, the &s;cene &s;unk into deeper repo&s;e. Even the &s;ailor's &s;ong had cea&s;ed; no &s;ound was heard but that of the waters da&s;hing beneath the ve&s;&s;el, and their fainter mur|mer on the pebbly coa&s;t. Adeline's mind was in uni&s;on with the tranquillity of the hour: lulled by the waves, &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to a &s;till melancholy and &s;at lo&s;t in reverie. The pre|&s;ent moment brought to her recollection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> voyage upon the Rhone, when &s;eeking refuge from the terrors of the Marquis de Montalt, &s;he &s;o anxiou&s;ly endeavoured to anticipate her fu|ture de&s;tiny. She then, as now, had watched the fall of evening and the fading pro&s;pect, and &s;he remembered what a de&s;olate feeling had accompanied the impre&s;&s;ion which tho&s;e objects made. She had then no friends&mdash;no a&s;ylum&mdash;no certainty of

e&s;caping the pur&s;uit of her enemy. Now &s;he had found affec|tionate friends&mdash;a &s;ecure retreat&mdash;and was delivered from the terrors &s;he then &s;uffered&mdash;but &s;till &s;he was unhappy. The re|membrance of Theodore&mdash;of Theodore who had loved her &s;o truly, who had encountered and &s;uffered &s;o much for her &s;ake, and of who&s;e fate &s;he was now as ignorant as when &s;he traver&s;|ed the Rhone, was an ince&s;&s;ant pang to her heart. She &s;eemed to be more remote than ever from the po&s;&s;ibility of hearing of him. Sometimes a faint hope cro&s;&s;ed her that he had e&s;cap|ed the malice of his per&s;ecutor; but when &s;he con&s;idered the inveteracy and power of the latter, and the henious light in which the law regards an a&s;&s;ault upon a &s;uperior officer, even this poor hope vani&s;hed, and left her to tears and angui&s;h, &s;uch as this reverie, which began with a &s;en&s;ation of only gentle melancholy, now led to. She continued to mu&s;e till the moon aro&s;e from the bo&s;om of the ocean, and &s;hed her trembling lu&s;|tre upon the waves, diffu&s;ing peace, and making &s;ilence more &s;olemn; beaming a &s;oft light on the white &s;ails, and throwing upon the waters the tall &s;hadow of the ve&s;&s;el, which now &s;eemed to glide along unoppo&s;ed by any current. Her tears had &s;omewhat relieved the angui&s;h of her mind, and &s;he again repo&s;ed in placed melancholy, when a &s;train of &s;uch tender and entrancing &s;weetne&s;s &s;tole on the &s;ilence of the hour, that it &s;eemed more like cele&s;tial than mortal mu&s;ic&mdash;&s;o &s;oft, &s;o &s;ooth|ing, it &s;unk upon her ear, that it recalled her from mi&s;ery to hope and love. She wept again&mdash;but the&s;e were tears which &s;he would not have exchanged for mirth and joy. She looked around, but perceived neither &s;hip or boat; and as the undula|ting &s;ounds &s;welled in the di&s;tant air, &s;he thought they came from the &s;hore. Sometimes the breeze wafted them away, and again returned them in tones of the mo&s;t langui&s;hing &s;oftne&s;s. The links of the air thus broken it was mu&s;ic rather than mel|ody that &s;he caught, till, the pilot gradually &s;teering nearer the coa&s;t, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the notes of a &s;ong familiar to her ear. She endeavoured to recollect where &s;he had heard it, but in vain; yet her heart beat almo&s;t uncon&s;ciou&s;ly with a &s;ome|thing re&s;embling hope. Still &s;he li&s;tened, till the breeze again &s;tole the &s;ounds. With regret &s;he now perceived that the ve&s;|&s;el was moving from them, and at length they trembled faintly on the waves, &s;unk away at a di&s;tance, and were heard no more. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e remained upon the deck a con&s;iderable time, unwilling to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nqui&s;h the expectation of hearing them again, and their &s;weetne&s;s &s;till vibrating on her fancy, and at length retired to

Adeline and Clara, who anxiou&s;ly watched his looks, rejoiced in their amendment; and the fond wi&s;hes of the latter already anticipated his perfect recovery.

<P>La Luc amu&s;ed him&s;elf at intervals with di&s;cour&s;ing, and pointing out the &s;ituations of con&s;iderable ports on the coa&s;t, and the mouths of the rivers, that, after wandering through Provence, di&s;embogue them&s;elves into the Mediterranean. The Rhone, however, was the only one of much con&s;equence which he pa&s;&s;ed. On this object, though it was &s;o di&s;tant that fan|cy, perhaps, rather than the &s;en&s;e, beheld it, Clara gazed with peculiar plea&s;ure, for it came from the banks of Savoy, and the wave which &s;he thought &s;he perceived, had wa&s;hed the feet of her dear native mountains. The time pa&s;&s;ed with mingled plea&s;ure and improvement as La Luc de&s;cribed to his attentive pupils the manners and commerce of the different inhabitants of the coa&s;t, and the natural hi&s;tory of the country, or as he tra|ced in imagination the remote wanderings of rivers to their &s;ource, and delineated the characteri&s;tic beauties of their &s;cenery.</P>
<P>After a plea&s;ant voyage of a few days, the &s;hores of Pro|vence receded, and that of Languedoc, which had long bounded the di&s;tance, became the grand object of the &s;cene, and the &s;ailors drew near their port. They landed in the afternoon at a &s;mall town &s;ituated at the foot of a woody eminence, on the right overlooking the &s;ea, and on the left rich plains of Lan|guedoc, gay with the purple vine. La Luc determined to defer his journey till the following day, and was directed to a &s;mall inn at the extremity of the town where the accomodation, &s;uch as it was, he endeavoured to be contented with.</P>
<P>In the evening the beauty of the hour, and the de&s;ire of ex|ploring new &s;cenes, invited Adeline to walk.

Often as &s;he went &s;he turned her eyes to catch between the dark foliage the blue waters of the bay, the white &s;ail that flit|ted by, and the trembling gleam of the &s;itting &s;un. When &s;he reached the &s;ummit, and looked down over the dark tops of the woods on the wide and various pro&s;pect, &s;he was &s;eized with a kind of &s;till rapture impo&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;tood un|con&s;cious of the flight of time, till the &s;un had left the &s;cene, and twilight threw its &s;olemn &s;hade upon the mountains. The &s;ea alone reflected the fading &s;plendour of the we&s;t; its tran|quil &s;urface was partially di&s;turbed by the low wind that crept in tremulous lines along the waters, whence ri&s;ing to the woods, it &s;hivered their light leaves, and died away.

<P>The &s;preading du&s;k at length reminded Adeline of her di&s;|tance from the inn, and that &s;he had her way to find through a

wild and lonely wood: &s;he bade adieu to the &s;yren that had &s;o long detained her, and pur&s;ued the path with quick &s;teps. Hav|ing followed it for &s;ometime, &s;he became bewildered among the thickets, and the increa&s;ing darkne&s;s did not allow her to judge of the direction &s;he was in. Her apprehen&s;ions heightened her difficulties: &s;he thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices of men at &s;ome little di&s;tance, and &s;he increa&s;ed her &s;peed till &s;he found her|&s;elf on the &s;ea &s;ands over which the woods impeded. Her breath was now exhau&s;ted&mdash;&s;he pau&s;ed a moment to recover her&s;elf, and fearfully li&s;tened; but, in&s;tead of the voices of men, &s;he heard faintly &s;welling in the breeze the notes of mournful mu&s;ic. Her heart, ever &s;en&s;ible to the impre&s;&s;ions of melody, melted with the tones, and her fears were for a moment lulled in &s;weet en|chantment. Surpri&s;e was &s;oon mingled with delight, when, as the &s;ounds advanced, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the tone of that in&s;tru|ment, and the melody of that well known air, &s;he had heard a few preceding evenings from the &s;hores of Provence. But &s;he had no time for conjecture&mdash;foot&s;teps approached, and &s;he re|newed her &s;peed. She was now emerged from the darkne&s;s of the woods, and the moon, which &s;hone bright, exhibited along the level &s;ands the town and port in the di&s;tance. The &s;teps that had followed, now came up with her, and &s;he perceived two men, but they pa&s;&s;ed in conver&s;ation without noticing her, and as they pa&s;&s;ed &s;he was certain &s;he recollected the voice of him who was then &s;peaking. Its tones were &s;o familiar to her ear, that &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;urpri&s;ed at the imperfect memory which did not &s;uffer her to be a&s;&s;ured by whom they were uttered. Another &s;tep now followed, and a rude voice called her to &s;top. As &s;he ha&s;tily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rned her eyes &s;he &s;aw imperfectly by the moonlight a man in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lor's habit pur&s;uing, while he renewed the call. Im|pelled by terror, &s;he fled along the &s;ands, but her &s;teps were &s;hort and trembling, tho&s;e of her pur&s;uer's &s;trong and quick.</P>
<P>She had ju&s;t &s;trength &s;ufficient to reach the men who had be|fore pa&s;&s;ed her, and to implore their protection, when her pur&s;uer came up with them, but &s;uddenly turned into the woods on the left, and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>She had no breath to an&s;wer the inquiries of the &s;trangers who &s;upported her, till a &s;udden exclamation, and the &s;ound of her own name drew her eyes attentively upon the per&s;on who utter|ed them, and in the rays which &s;hone &s;trong upon his features, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed M. Verneuil! Mutual &s;atisfaction and expla|nation en&s;ued, and when he learned that La Luc and his daugh|ter were at the inn, he felt an increa&s;ed plea&s;ure in conducting
<PB N="116" REF="029379_0138_0FE08E10B21D25B8">
her thither. He &s;aid that he had accidentally met with an old friend in Savoy, whom he now introduced by the name of Mau|ron, and who had prevailed on him to change his route and ac|company him to the &s;hores of the Mediterranean. They had embarked from the coa&s;t of Provence only a few preceding days, and had that evening landed in Languedoc on the e&s;tate of M. Mauron. Adeline had now no doubt that it was the flute of M. Verneuil, and which had &s;o often delighted her at Leloncourt, that &s;he had heard on the &s;ea.</P>
<P>When they reached the inn they found La Luc under great anxiety for Adeline, in &s;earch of whom he had &s;ent &s;everal peo|ple. Anxiety yielded to &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure, when he per|ceived her with M. Verneuil, who&s;e eyes beamed with unu&s;ual animation on &s;eeing Clara. After mutual congratulations, M. Verneuil ob&s;erved, and lamented, the very indifferent accom|modation which the inn afforded his friends, and M. Mauron immediately invited them to his chateau with a warmth of ho&s;|pitality that overcame every &s;cruple which delicacy or pride could oppo&s;e. The woods that Adeline had traver&s;ed formed a part of his deme&s;ne, which extended almo&s;t to the inn; but he in&s;i&s;ted that his carriage &s;hould take his gue&s;ts to the chateau, and departed to give orders for their reception. The pre&s;ence of M. Verneuil, and the kindne&s;s of his friends, gave La Luc an unu&s;ual flow of &s;pirits; he conver&s;ed with a degree of vigour and liveline&s;s to which he had long been unaccu&s;tomed, and the &s;mile of &s;atisfaction that Clara gave to Adeline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ed how much &s;he thought he was already benefited by the voyage. Adeline an&s;wered her look with a &s;mile of le&s;s confidence, for &s;he attributed his pre&s;ent animation to a more temporary cau&s;e.</P>
<P>About half an hour after the departure of M. Mauron, a boy who &s;erved as waiter, brought a me&s;&s;age from a chevalier then at the inn, reque&s;ting to &s;peak with Adeline. The man who had pur&s;ued her along the &s;ands in&s;tantly occurred to her, and &s;he &s;carcely doubted that the &s;tranger was &s;ome per&s;on belong|ing to the Marquis de Montalt, perhaps the Marquis him&s;elf, though that he &s;hould have di&s;covered her accidentally, in &s;o ob&s;cure a place, and &s;o immediately upon her arrival, &s;eemed very improbable. With trembling lips, and a countenance as pale as death, &s;he inquired the name of the chevalier. The boy was not acquainted with it. La Luc a&s;ked what &s;ort of a per|&s;on he was; but the boy, who under&s;tood little of the art of de&s;cribing, gave &s;uch a confu&s;ed account of him, that Adeline could only learn that he was not large, but of the middle &s;tatu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.
<PB N="117" REF="029379_0138_0FE08E10B21D25B8">
This circum&s;tance, however, convincing her that it was not the Marquis de Montalt who de&s;ired to &s;ee her, &s;he a&s;ked whether it would be agreeable to La Luc to have the &s;tranger admitted. La Luc &s;aid, "By all means;" and the waiter withdrew. Ade|line &s;at in trembling expectation till the door opened, and Louis de la Motte entered the room. He advanced with an embara&s;|&s;ed and melancholy air, though his countenance had been en|lightened with a momentary plea&s;ure when he fir&s;t beheld Ade|line: Adeline who was &s;till the idol of his heart. After the fir&s;t &s;alutations were over, all apprehen&s;ions of the Marquis be|ing now di&s;&s;ipated, &s;he inquired when Louis had &s;een Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte.</P>
<P>"I ought rather to a&s;k you that que&s;tion," &s;aid Louis, "in &s;ome confu&s;ion, for I believe you have &s;een them &s;ince I have; and the plea&s;ure of meeting you thus is equalled by my &s;urpri&s;e. I have not heard from my father for &s;ometime, owing probably to my regiment being removed to new quarters."</P>
<P>He looked as if he wi&s;hed to be informed with whom Ade|line now was; but as this was a &s;ubject upon which it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he could &s;peak in the pre&s;ence of La Luc, &s;he led the conver&s;ation to general topics, after having &s;aid that Mon&s;ieur and Madame La Motte were well when &s;he left them. Louis &s;poke little, and often looked anxiou&s;ly at Adeline, while his mind &s;eemed labouring under &s;trong oppre&s;&s;ion. She ob&s;erved this, and recollecting the declaration he had made her on the morning of his departure from the Abbey, &s;he attributed his pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ment to the effect of a pa&s;&s;ion yet un&s;ubdued, and did not appear to notice it. After he had &s;at near a quarter of an hour, under a &s;truggle of feelings which he could neither conquer or conceal, he ro&s;e to leave the room, and as he pa&s;&s;ed Adeline, &s;aid, in a low voice, "do permit me to &s;peak with you alone for five minutes." She he&s;itated in &s;ome confu&s;ion, and then &s;aying there were none but friends pre&s;ent, begged he would be &s;eated.&mdash;"Excu&s;e me," &s;aid he, in the &s;ame low accent; "What I would &s;ay nearly concerns you, and you only. "Do favour me with a few moments attention." He &s;aid this with a look that &s;urpri&s;ed her; and having ordered candles in another room, &s;he went thither.</P>
<P>Louis &s;at for &s;ome moments &s;ilent, and &s;eemingly in great per|turbation of mind. At length he &s;aid, "I know not whether to rejoice or to lament at this unexpected meeting, though, if you are in &s;afe hands, I ought certainly to rejoice, however hard the ta&s;k that now falls to my lot.

<P>"Who is it you &s;peak of, Sir," &s;aid Adeline, with quick|ne&s;s. Louis ro&s;e from his chair, and walked about the room. "I would prepare you for what I have to &s;ay." he re&s;umed&punc; "but upon my &s;oul I am not equal to it."</P>
<P>"I entreat you to keep me no longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e," &s;aid Adeline, who had a wild idea that it was Theodore he would &s;peak of. Louis &s;till he&s;itated. "Is it&mdash;O is it?&mdash;I conjure you tell me the wor&s;t at once," &s;aid &s;he, in a voice of agony. "I can bear it&mdash;indeed I can."</P>
<P>"My unhappy friend!" exclaimed Louis, "O Theodore!" Theodore!" faintly articulated Adeline, "he lives then!"&mdash; "He does," &s;aid Louis, "but"&mdash;He &s;topped.&mdash;"But what?" cried Adeline, trembling violently; "If he is living you can|not tell me wor&s;e than my fears &s;ugge&s;t; I entreat you, there|fore not to he&s;itate."&mdash;Louis re&s;umed his &s;eat, and endeavouring to a&s;&s;ume a collected air, &s;aid, he is living, Madame, but he is a pri&s;oner, and&mdash;for why &s;hould I deceive you? I fear he has lit|tle to hope in this world."</P>
<P>"I have long feared &s;o, Sir," &s;aid Adeline, in a voice of forced compo&s;ure; "you have &s;omething more terrible than this to relate, and I again intreat you will explain your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"He has every thing to apprehend from the Marquis de Montalt," &s;aid Louis. "Alas! why do I &s;ay to apprehend! His judgment is already fixed&mdash;he is condemned to die."</P>
<P>At this confirmation of her fears a death-like palene&s;s diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over the countenance of Adeline; &s;he &s;at motionle&s;s, and attempted to &s;igh, but &s;eemed almo&s;t &s;uffocated. Terrified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her &s;ituation, and expecting to &s;ee her &s;aint, Louis would hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;upported her, but with her hand &s;he waved him from her, and
<PB N="119" REF="029379_0139_0FE08E1650004C58">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unable to &s;peak. He now called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and La Luc <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Clara with M. Verneuil, informed of Adeline's indi&s;po&s;i|tion, were quickly by her &s;ide.</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of their voices &s;he looked up, and &s;eemed to recollect her&s;elf, when uttering a heavy &s;igh &s;he bur&s;t into tears. La Luc rejoiced to &s;ee her weep, encouraged her tears, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ometime, relieved her, and when &s;he was able to &s;peak, &s;he de&s;ired to go back to La Luc's parlour. Louis attended her thither; when &s;he was better he would have withdrawn b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t La Luc begged he would &s;tay.</P>
<P>"You are perhaps a relation of this young lady, Sir," &s;aid he, "and may have brought news of her father."&mdash;"Not &s;o, Sir," replied Louis, he&s;itating&mdash;"This gentleman," &s;aid Ade|line, who had now recollected her di&s;&s;ipated thoughts, "is the &s;on of the M. La Motte, whom you may have heard me men|tion."&mdash;Louis &s;eemed &s;hocked to be declared the &s;on of a man that had once acted &s;o unworthily towards Adeline, who in|&s;tantly perceiving the pain her words occa&s;ioned, endeavoured to &s;often their effect by &s;aying that La Motte had &s;aved her fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> imminent danger, and had afforded her an a&s;ylum for ma|ny months. Adeline &s;at in a &s;tate of dreadful &s;olicitude to know the particulars of Theodore's &s;ituation, yet could not acquire courage to renew the &s;ubject in the pre&s;ence of La Luc; &s;he ventured, however, to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Louis if his own regiment was quar|tered in the town.</P>
<P>He replied that his regiment lay at Vaceau, a French town on the frontiers of Spain; that he had ju&s;t cro&s;&s;ed a part of the Gulph of Lyons, and was on his way to Savoy, whither he &s;hould &s;et out early in the morning.</P>
<P>"We are lately come from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence," &s;aid Adeline; "may I a&s;k to what part of Savoy you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re going?" "To Leloncourt." he replied, "To Leloncourt!" &s;aid Adeline, in &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e. "I am a &s;tranger to the country," re&s;umed Louis, "but I go to &s;erve my friend. You &s;eem to know Leloncourt." "I do indeed," &s;aid Adeline, "You probably know then that M. La Luc lives there, and will gue&s;s the motive of my journey."</P>
<P>"O heavens! is it po&s;&s;ible?" exclaimed Adeline&mdash;"is it po&s;&s;ible that Theodore Peyrou is a relation of M. La Luc!"</P>
<P>"Theodore! what of my &s;on?" a&s;ked La Luc, in &s;urpri&s;e and apprehen&s;ion. "Your &s;on!" &s;aid Adeline, in a trembling voice, "your &s;on!" The a&s;toni&s;hment and angui&s;h depictured on her countenance increa&s;ed the apprehen&s;ions of this unfortu|nate father, and he renewed his que&s;tion. But Adeline was to|tally
<PB N="120" REF="029379_0140_0FE08E24870C3EB8">
unable to an&s;wer him; and the di&s;tre&s;s of Louis, in thus unexpectedly di&s;covering the father of his unhappy friend, and knowing that it was his ta&s;k to di&s;clo&s;e the fate of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de|prived him for &s;ometime of all power of utterance, and La Luc and Clara, who&s;e fears were every in&s;tant heightened by this dreadful &s;ilence, continued to repeat their que&s;tions.</P>
<P>At length a &s;en&s;e of the approaching &s;ufferings of the good La Luc overcoming every other feeling, Adeline recovered &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient to try to &s;often the intelligence Louis had to communicate, and to conduct Clara to another room. Here &s;he collected re&s;olution to tell her, and with much tender con&s;ideration, the circum&s;tances of her brother's &s;ituation, con|cealing only her knowledge of his &s;entence being already pro|nounced. This relation nece&s;&s;arily included the mention of their attachment, and in the friend of her heart Clara di&s;covered the innocent cau&s;e of her brother's de&s;truction. Adeline al&s;o learned &s;he occa&s;ion of that circum&s;tance which had contributed to keep her ignorant of Theodore's relation&s;hip to La Luc; &s;he was told the former had taken the name of Peyrou, with an e&s;|tate which had been left him about a year before by a relation of his mother's upon that condition. Theodore had been de|&s;igned for the church, but his di&s;po&s;ition inclined him to a more active life than the clerical, habit would admit of, and on his acce&s;&s;ion to this e&s;tate he had entered into the &s;ervice of the French King.</P>
<P>In the few and interrupted interviews, which had been allowed them at Caux, Theodore had mentioned his family to Adeline only in general terms, and thus, when they were &s;o &s;uddenly &s;eparated, had, without de&s;igning it left her in ignorance of his father's name and place of re&s;idence.</P>
<P>The &s;acredne&s;s and delicacy of Adeline's grief, which had never permitted her to mention the &s;ubject of it even to Clara, had &s;ince contributed to deceive her.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s of Clara, on learning the &s;ituation of her bro|ther, could endure no re&s;traint; Adeline, who had comma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her feelings &s;o as to impart this intelligence with tolerable compo&s;ure, only by a &s;trong effort of mind, was now almo&s;t overwhelmed by her own and Clara's accumulated &s;uffering. While they wept forth the angui&s;h of their hearts, a &s;cene, if po&s;&s;ible, more affecting pa&s;&s;ed between La Luc and Louis, who perceived it was nece&s;&s;ary to inform him, though cautio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and by degrees, of the &s;oft extent of his calamity. He there|fore told La Luc, that though Theodore had been fir&s;t tried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="121" REF="029379_0140_0FE08E24870C3EB8">
the offence of having quitted his po&s;t, he was now condemned on a charge of a&s;&s;ault made upon his general officer, the Marquis de Montalt, who had brought witne&s;&s;es to prove that his life had been endangered by the circum&s;tance; and who having pur&s;ued the pro&s;ecution with the mo&s;t bitter rancour, had at length obtained the &s;entence which the law could not withhold, but which every other officer in the regiment deplored.</P>
<P>Louis added, that the &s;entence was to be executed in le&s;s than a fortnight, and that Theodore being very unhappy at re|ceiving no an&s;wers to the letters he had &s;ent his father, wi&s;hing to &s;ee him once more, and knowing that there was now no time to be lo&s;t, had reque&s;ted him to go to Leloncourt, and acquaint his father with his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>La Luc received the account of his &s;on's condition with a di&s;tre&s;s that admitted neither of tears or complaint. He a&s;ked where Theodore was, and de&s;iring to be conducted to him, he thanked Louis for all his kindne&s;s, and ordered po&s;t hor&s;es im|mediately.</P>
<P>A carriage was &s;oon ready, and this unhappy, father, after taking a mournful leave of M. Verneuil, and &s;ending a com|pliment to M. Mauron, attended by his family, &s;et out for the pri&s;on of his &s;on. The journey was a &s;ilent one; each indivi|dual of the party endeavoured, in con&s;ideration of each other, to &s;uppre&s;s the expre&s;&s;ion of grief, but was unable to do more. La Luc appeared calm and complacent; he &s;eemed frequently to be engaged in prayer; but a &s;truggle for re&s;ignation and com|po&s;ure was &s;ometimes vi&s;ible upon his countenance, notwith|&s;tanding the efforts of his mind.</P>

<P>WE now return to the Marquis de Montalt, who having &s;een La Motte &s;afely lodged in the pri&s;on of D&mdash;y, and learning the trial would not come on immediately, had return|ed to his villa on the borders of the fore&s;t, where he expected to hear news of Adeline. It had been his intention to follow his &s;ervants to Lyons; but he now determined to wait a few days for letters, and he had little doubt that Adeline, &s;ince her flight had been &s;o quickly pur&s;ued, would be overtaken, and probably before &s;he could reach that city. In this expectation
<PB N="122" REF="029379_0141_0FE08E2942E52660">
he had been mi&s;erably di&s;appointed; for his &s;ervants informed him, that though they traced her thither, they had neither been able to follow her route beyond, nor to di&s;cover her at Lyons. This e&s;cape &s;he probably owed to having embarked on the Rhone, for it does not appear that the Marquis's people thought of &s;eeking her on the cour&s;e of that river.</P>
<P>His pre&s;ence was &s;oon after required at Vaceau&punc; where the court martial was then &s;itting; thither, therefore, he went with pa&s;&s;ions &s;till more exa&s;perated by his late di&s;appointment, and procured the conde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nation of Theodore. The &s;entence was univer&s;ally lamented, for Theodore was much beloved in his reg|iment; and the occa&s;ion of the Marquis's per&s;onal re&s;entment towards him being known, every heart was intere&s;ted in his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Louis de la Motte happening at this time to be &s;tationed in the &s;ame town, heard an imperfect account of his &s;tory, and be|ing convinced that the pri&s;oner was the young chevalier whom he had formerly &s;een with the Marquis at the Abbey, he was in|duced, partly from compa&s;&s;ion, and partly with a hope of hear|ing of his parents, to vi&s;it him. The compa&s;&s;ionate &s;ympathy which Louis expre&s;&s;ed, and the zeal with which he tendered his &s;ervices, affected Theodore, and excited in him a warm return of friend&s;hip. Louis made him frequent vi&s;its, did every thing that kindne&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t to alleviate his &s;ufferings, and a mutual e&s;teem and confidence en&s;ued.</P>
<P>Theodore at length communicated the chief &s;ubject of his concern to Louis, who di&s;covered with inexpre&s;&s;ible grief, that it was Adeline whom the Marquis had thus cruelly per&s;ecuted, that Adeline for who&s;e &s;ake the generous Theodore was about to &s;uffer. He &s;oon perceived al&s;o that Theodore was his favour|ed rival; but he generou&s;ly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the jealous pang this di&s;|covery occa&s;ioned, and determined that no prejudice of pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould withdraw him from the duties of humanity and friend|&s;hip. He eagerly inquired where Adeline then re&s;ided. "She is yet, I fear, in the power of the Marquis," &s;aid Theodore, &s;ighing deeply, "O God! the&s;e chains!" and he threw an agonizing glance upon them. Louis &s;at &s;ilent and thoughtful; at length &s;tarting from his reverie, he &s;aid, he would go to the Marquis, and immediately quitted the pri&s;on. The Marquis was, however, already &s;et off for Paris, where he had been &s;um|moned to appear at the approaching trial of La Motte; and Louis, yet ignorant of the late tran&s;actions at the Abbey, return|ed to the pri&s;on, where he endeavoured to forget that Theo|dore was the favoured rival of his love, and to remember him only as the defender of Adeline. So earne&s;tly he pre&s;&s;ed his of|fers
<PB N="123" REF="029379_0141_0FE08E2942E52660">
of &s;ervice, that Theodore, whom the &s;ilence of his father equally &s;urpri&s;ed and afflicted, and who was very anxious to &s;ee him once again, accepted his propo&s;al of going him&s;elf to Savoy. "My letters I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect to have been intercepted by the Marquis," &s;aid Theodore; "if &s;o, my poor father will have the whole weight of this c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lamity to &s;u&s;tain at once, unle&s;s I avail my&s;elf of your kindne&s;s, and I &s;hall neither &s;ee him nor hear from him before I die. Louis! there are moments when my fortitude &s;hrinks from the conflict, and my &s;en&s;es threaten to de&s;ert me."</P>
<P>No time was to be lo&s;t; the warrant for his execution had already received the king's &s;ignature, and Louis immediately &s;et forward for Savoy. The letters of Theodore had indeed been intercepted by order of the Marquis, who, in the hope of di&s;|covering the a&s;ylum of Adeline, had opened and afterwards de&s;|troyed them.</P>
<P>But to return to La Luc, who now drew near Vaceau, and whom his family ob&s;erved to be greatly changed in his looks &s;ince he had heard the late calamitous intelligence; he uttered no com|plaint; but it was too obvious that his di&s;order had made a rapid progre&s;s. Louis, who, during the journey, proved the goodne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition by the delicate attentions he paid this unhappy party, concealed his ob&s;ervation of the decline of La Luc, and to &s;upport Adeline's &s;pirits, endeavoured to convince her that her apprehen&s;ions on this &s;ubject were groundle&s;s. Her &s;pirits did indeed require &s;upport, for &s;he was now within a few miles of the town that contained Theodore; and while her in|crea&s;ing perturbation almo&s;t overcome her, &s;he yet tried to ap|pear compo&s;ed. When the carriage entered the town, &s;he ca&s;t a timid and anxious glance from the window in &s;earch of the pri&s;on; but having pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal &s;treets without per|ceiving any building which corre&s;ponded with her idea of that &s;he looked for, the coach &s;topped at the inn. The frequent changes in La Luc's countenance betrayed the violent agitation of his mind, and when he attempted to alight, feeble and ex|hau&s;ted, he was compelled to accept the &s;upport of Louis, to whom he faintly &s;aid, as he pa&s;&s;ed to the parlour, "I am indeed &s;ick at heart, but I tru&s;t the pain will not be long." Louis pre&s;|&s;ed his hand without &s;peaking, and ha&s;tened back for Adeline and Clara, who were already in the pa&s;&s;age. La Luc wiped the tears from his eyes (they were the fir&s;t he had &s;hed) as they entered the room. "I would go immediately to my poor boy," &s;aid he to Louis; "yours, Sir, is a mournful office&mdash;be &s;o good
<PB N="124" REF="029379_0142_0FE08E33CBC1DF58">
as to conduct me to him." He ro&s;e to go, but, feeble and over|come with grief, again &s;at down. Adeline and Clara united in entreating that he would compo&s;e him&s;elf, and take &s;ome re|fre&s;hment, and Louis urging the nece&s;&s;ity of prepairing Theo|dore for the interview, prevailed with him to delay it till his &s;on &s;hould be informed of his arrival, and immediately quitted the inn for the pri&s;on of his friend. When he was gone, La Luc, as a duty he owed tho&s;e he loved, tried to take &s;ome &s;up|port, but the convul&s;ions of his throat would not &s;uffer him to &s;wallow the wire that he held to his parched lips, and he was now &s;o much di&s;ordered, that he de&s;ired to retire to his cham|ber, where alone, and in prayer, he pa&s;&s;ed the dreadful interval of Louis's ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Clara on the bo&s;om of Adeline, who &s;at in calm but deep di&s;tre&s;s, yielded to the violence of her grief. "I &s;hall lo&s;e my dear father too," &s;aid &s;he; "I &s;ee it; I &s;hall lo&s;e my father and my brother together." Adeline wept with her friend for &s;ometime in &s;ilence; and then attempted to per&s;uade her that La Luc was not &s;o ill as &s;he apprehended.</P>
<P>"Do not mi&s;lead me with hope," &s;he replied, "he will not &s;urvive the &s;hock of this calamity: I &s;aw it from the fir&s;t." Adeline knowing that La Luc's di&s;tre&s;s would be heightened by the ob&s;ervance of his daughter's, and that indulgence would on|ly increa&s;e its poignancy, endeavoured to arou&s;e her to an ex|ertion of fortitude, by urging the nece&s;&s;ity of commanding her emotion in the pre&s;ence of her father. "This is po&s;&s;ible," added &s;he, "however painful may be the effort. You mu&s;t know my dear, that my grief is not inferior to your own, yet I have hitherto been enabled to &s;upport my &s;ufferings, in &s;ilence, for M. La Luc I do indeed, love and reverence as a parent."</P>
<P>Louis meanwhile reached the pri&s;on of Theodore, who re|ceived him with an air of mingled &s;urpri&s;e and impatience. "What brings you back &s;o &s;oon," &s;aid he, "have you heard news of my father?" Louis now gradually unfolded the circum|&s;tances of their meeting, and La Luc's arrival at Vaceau. A various emotion agitated the countenance of Theodore on re|ceiving this intelligence. "My poor father!" &s;aid he, "he has then followed his &s;on to this ignominious place! Little did I think when la&s;t we parted he would meet me in a pri&s;on, under condemnation!" This reflection rou&s;ed an impetuo&s;ity of grief which deprived him for &s;ometime of &s;peech. "But where is he?" &s;aid Theodore, recovering him&s;elf; "now he is come, I &s;hrink from the interview I have &s;o much wi&s;hed for. The
<PB N="125" REF="029379_0142_0FE08E33CBC1DF58">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght of his di&s;tre&s;s will be dreadful to me. Louis! when I am gone, comfort my poor father." His voice was again interrupt|ed by &s;obs; and Louis, who had been fearful of acquainting him at the &s;ame time of the arrival of La Luc, and the di&s;cov|ery of Adeline, now judged it proper to admini&s;ter the cordial of this latter intelligence.</P>
<P>The glooms of a pri&s;on, and of calamity, vani&s;hed for a tran|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent moment; tho&s;e who had &s;een Theodore would have be|lieved this to be the in&s;tant which gave him life and liberty. When his fir&s;t emotions &s;ub&s;ided, "I will not repine," &s;aid he, "&s;ince I know that Adeline is pre&s;erved, and that I &s;hall once more &s;ee my father, I will endeavour to die with re&s;ignation." He inquired if La Luc was then in the pri&s;on; and was told he was at the inn with Clara and Adeline. "Adeline! Is Ade|line there too! "This is beyond my hopes. Yet why do I rejoice? I mu&s;t never &s;ee her more: this is no place for Ade|line." Again he relap&s;ed into an agony of di&s;tre&s;s, and again repeated a thou&s;and que&s;tions concerning Adeline, till he was reminded by Louis that his father was impatient to &s;ee him, when, &s;hocked that he had &s;o long detained his friend, he en|treated him to conduct La Luc to the pri&s;on, and endeavoured to recollect fortitude for the approaching interview.</P>
<P>When Louis returned to the inn, La Luc was &s;till in his chamber, and Clara quitting the room to call him, Adeline &s;eized, with trembling impatience, the opportunity to inquire more particularly concerning Theodore, than &s;he cho&s;e to do in the pre&s;ence of his unhappy &s;i&s;ter. Louis repre&s;ented him to be much more tranquil than he really was: Adeline was &s;omewhat &s;oothed by the account; and her tears, hitherto re&s;trained, flowed &s;ilently and fa&s;t, till La Luc appeared. His countenance had recovered its &s;erenity, but was impre&s;&s;ed with a deep and &s;teady &s;orrow, which excited in the beholder a mingled emo|tion of pity and reverence. "How is my &s;on? Sir," &s;aid he as he entered the room. "We will go to him immediately."</P>
<P>Clara renewed the entreaties that had been already rejected, to accompany her father, who per&s;i&s;ted in a refu&s;al. "To mor|row you &s;hall &s;ee him," added he; "but our fir&s;t meeting mu&s;t be alone. Stay with your friend, my dear; &s;he has need of con&s;o|lation." When La Luc was gone, Adeline, unable longer to &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|gle again&s;t the force of grief, retired to her chamber <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

overcome with agitation, leaned again&s;t the po&s;tern till the porter appeared. He inquired for Theodore, and followed the man; but when he reached the &s;econd court yard he &s;eemed ready to faint, and again &s;topped. Louis de&s;ired the porter would fetch &s;ome water; but La Luc, recovering his voice, &s;aid he &s;hould &s;oon be better, and would not &s;uffer him to go. In a few minutes he was able to follow Louis, who led him through &s;everal dark pa&s;&s;ages, and up a flight of &s;teps to a door, which being unbarred di&s;clo&s;ed to him the pri&s;on of his &s;on. he was &s;eated at a &s;mall table, on which &s;tood a lamp that threw a feeble light acro&s;s the place &s;ufficient only to &s;hew its de&s;o|lation and wretchedne&s;s. When he perceived La Luc he &s;prung from his chair, and in the next moment was in his arms, "My father &s;aid he in a tremulous voice. "My &s;on!" exclaimed La Luc; and they were for &s;ome time &s;ilent, and locked in each other's embrace. At length Theodore led him to the on|ly chair the room afforded, and &s;eating him&s;elf with Louis at the foot of the bed, had lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve the ravages which illne&s;s and calamity had made on the features of his parent. La Luc made &s;everal efforts to &s;peak, but unable to articulate, laid his hand upon his brea&s;t and &s;ighed deeply. Fearful of the con&s;equence of &s;o affecting a &s;cene on his &s;hattered frame Louis endeavoured to call off his attention from the immediate object of his di&s;tre&s;s, and interrupted the &s;ilence; but La Luc &s;hud|dering and complaining he was very cold, &s;unk back in his chair. His condition rou&s;ed Theodore from the &s;tupor of di&s;|pair; and while he flew to &s;upport his father, Louis ran out for other a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;"I &s;hall &s;oon be better, Theodore," &s;aid La Luc unclo&s;ing his eyes, "the faintne&s;s is already gone off. I have not been well of late; and this &s;ad meeting!" Unable any longer to command him&s;elf&punc; Theodore wrung his hand, and the di&s;tre&s;s which had long &s;truggled for utterance bur&s;t in con|vul&s;ive &s;obs from his brea&s;t. La Luc gradually revived, and exerted him&s;elf to calm the tran&s;ports of his &s;on; but the forti|tude of the latter had now entirely for&s;aken him, and he could only utter exclamation and complaint. "Ah! little did I think we &s;hould ever meet under circum&s;tances &s;o dreadful as the pre&s;ent! But I have not de&s;erved them, my father! the motives of my conduct have &s;till been ju&s;t."</P>
<P>"That is my &s;upreme con&s;olation," &s;aid La Luc, "and ought to &s;upport you in this hour of trial. The almighty God who is the judge of hearts, will reward you hereafter. Tru&s;t in him my &s;on; I look to him with no feeble hope, but with a firm reliance
<PB N="127" REF="029379_0143_0FE08E39AF896730">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n his ju&s;tice!" La Luc's voice faultered; he rai&s;ed his eyes to heaven with an expre&s;&s;ion of meek devotion, while the tears of humanity fell &s;lowly on his cheek.</P>
<P>Still more affected by his la&s;t words, Theodore turned from him, and paced the room with quick &s;teps: the entrance of Louis was a very &s;ea&s;onable relief to La Luc, who, taking a cordial he had brought, was &s;oon &s;ufficiently re&s;tored to di&s;|cour&s;e on the &s;ubject mo&s;t intere&s;ting to him. Theodore tried to attain a command of his feelings, and &s;ucceeded. He con|ver&s;ed with tolerable compo&s;ure for above an hour, during which La Luc endeavoured to elevate, by religious hope, the mind of his &s;on, and to enable him to meet with fortitude the awful hour that approached. But the appearance of re&s;ig|nation which Theodore attained always vani&s;hed when he re|flected that he was going to leave his father a prey to grief, and his beloved Adeline for ever. When La Luc was about to dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, he again mentioned her. "Afflicting as an interview mu&s;t be in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances," &s;aid he, "I cannot hear the thought of quitting the world without &s;eeing her once again; yet I know not how to a&s;k her to encounter for my &s;ake, the mi&s;ery of a parting &s;cene. Tell her that my thoughts never for a moment leave her; that"&mdash;La Luc interrupted, and a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;ince he &s;o much wi&s;hed it, he &s;hould &s;ee her, though a meeting could &s;erve only to heighten the mutual angui&s;h of a final &s;eparation.</P>
<P>"I know it; I know it too well," &s;aid Theodore; "yet I cannot re&s;olve to &s;ee her no more, and thus &s;pare her the pain this interview mu&s;t inflict. O my father! when I think of tho&s;e whom I mu&s;t &s;oon leave for ever my heart breaks. But I will indeed try to profit by your precept and example, and &s;hew that your paternal care has not been in vain. My good Louis, go with my father; he has need of &s;upport. How much I owe this generous friend," added Theodore, "You well know, Sir." "I do in truth," replied La Luc, "and can never repay his kindne&s;s to you. He has contributed to &s;upport us all; but you require comfort more than my&s;elf; he &s;hall re|main with you; I will go alone." This Theodore would not &s;uffer; and La Luc no longer oppo&s;ing him, they affectionately embraced, and &s;eparated for the night.</P>
<P>When they reached the inn, La Luc con&s;ulted with Louis on the po&s;&s;ibility of addre&s;&s;ing a petition to the &s;overeign, time enough to &s;ave Theodore. His di&s;tance from Paris and the &s;hort interval before the period fixed for the execution of the &s;entence, made this de&s;ign difficult; but believing it was practi|cable,
<PB N="128" REF="029379_0144_0FE08E4603539FA0">
La Luc, incapable as he appeared of performing &s;o long a journey, determined to attempt it. Louis thinking that the undertaking would prove fatal to the father, without benefit|ting the &s;on, endeavoured, though faintly, to di&s;&s;uade him from it; but his re&s;olution was fixed. "If I &s;acrifice the &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|mains of my life in the &s;ervice of my child," &s;aid he, "I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> lo&s;e little: if I &s;ave him, I &s;hall gain every thing. There is no time to be lo&s;t; I will &s;et off immediately.</P>
<P>He would have ordered po&s;t hor&s;es, but Louis, and Clara, who was now come from the bed-&s;ide of her friend, urged the nece&s;&s;ity of his taking a few hours repo&s;e: he was at length compelled to acknowledge him&s;elf unequal to the immediate exertion which the parental anxiety prompted, and con&s;ented to &s;eek re&s;t.</P>
<P>When he had retired to his chamber, Clara lamented the condition of her father. "He will not bear the journey," &s;aid &s;he; "he is greatly changed within the&s;e few days." Louis was &s;o entirely of her opinion that he could not di&s;gui&s;e it, even to flatter her with a hope. She added, what did not contribute to rai&s;e his &s;pirits, that Adeline was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed by her grief for the &s;ituation of Theodore, and the &s;ufferings of La Luc, that &s;he dreaded the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>It has been &s;een that the pa&s;&s;ion of young La Motte had &s;uffered no abatement from time or ab&s;ence; on the contrary, the per&s;ecution and the dangers which had pur&s;ued Adeline awakened all his tenderne&s;s, and drew her nearer to his heart. When he had di&s;covered that Theodore loved her, and was be|loved again, he experienced all the angui&s;h of jealou&s;y and di&s;|appointment; for though &s;he had forbade him to hope, he found it too painful an effort to obey her, and had &s;ecretly cheri&s;hed the flame which he ought to have &s;tifled. His heart was however, too noble to &s;uffer his zeal for Theodore to abate becau&s;e he was his fovoured rival, and his mind too &s;trong not to conceal the angui&s;h this certainty occa&s;ioned. The at|tachment which Theodore had te&s;tified towards Adeline ev|en endeared him to Louis, when he had recovered from the fir&s;t &s;hock of di&s;appointment, and that conque&s;t over jealou&s;y which originated in principle, and was pur&s;ued with difficulty, became afterwards his pride and his glory. When, however, he again &s;aw Adeline; &s;aw her in the mild dignity of &s;orrow more intere&s;ting than ever; &s;aw her, though &s;inking beneath its pre&s;|&s;ure, yet tender and &s;olicitous to &s;often the afflictions of tho&s;e around her; it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty he pre&s;erved his

re&s;olution, and forbore to expre&s;s the &s;entiments &s;he in&s;pired. When he farther con&s;idered that her acute &s;ufferings aro&s;e from the &s;trength of her affection, he more than ever wi&s;hed him&s;elf the object of a heart capable of &s;o tender a regard, and Theo|do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in pri&s;on and in chains was a momentary object of envy.</P>
<P>In the morning, when La Luc aro&s;e from &s;hort and di&s;turbed &s;lumbers, he found Louis, Clara and Adeline, whom indi&s;po&s;i|tion could not prevent from paying him this te&s;timony of re&s;pect and affection, a&s;&s;embled in the parlour of the inn to &s;ee him de|part. After a &s;light breakfa&s;t, during which his feelings per|mitted him to &s;ay little, he bade his friends a &s;ad farewell, and &s;tepped into the carriage, followed by their tears and prayers. Adeline immediately retired to her chamber, which &s;he was too ill to quit that day. In the evening Clara left her friend, and conducted by Louis, went to vi&s;it her brother, who&s;e emotions, on hearing of his father's departure, were various and &s;trong.</P>

<P>WE return now to Pierre de la Motte, who after remain|ing &s;ome weeks in the pri&s;on of D&mdash;y, was removed to take his trial in the court of Paris, whither the Marquis de Montalt followed to pro&s;ecute the charge. Madame de la Mot|te accompanied her hu&s;band to the pri&s;on of the Chatelet. His mind &s;unk under the weight of his misfortunes; nor could all the efforts of his wife rou&s;e him from the torpidity of de&s;pair which a con&s;ideration of his circum&s;tances occa&s;ioned. Should he be even acquitted of the charge brought again&s;t him by the Marquis (which was very unlikely) he was now in the &s;cene of his former crimes, and the moment that &s;hould liberate him from the walls of his pri&s;on would probably deliver him again into the hands of offended ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecution of the Marquis was too well founded, and its object of a nature too &s;erious, not to ju&s;tify the terror of La Motte. Soon after the latter had &s;ettled at the Abbey of St. Clair, the &s;mall &s;tock of money which the emergency of his
<PB N="130" REF="029379_0145_0FE08E4AB02A94E8">
circum&s;tances had left him being nearly exhau&s;ted, his mind became corroded with the mo&s;t cruel anxiety concerning the means of his future &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. As he was one evening riding alone in a remote part of the fore&s;t, mu&s;ing on his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, and meditating plans to relieve the exigencies which he &s;aw approaching, he perceived among the trees at &s;ome di&s;tance a chevalier on hor&s;eback, who was riding deliberately along, and &s;eemed wholly unattended. A thought darted acro&s;s the mind of La Motte, that he might be &s;pared the evils which threatened him by robbing this &s;tranger. His former practices had pa&s;&s;ed the boundary of hone&s;ty; fraud was in &s;ome degree familiar to him, and the thought was not di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. He he&s;i|tated, every moment of he&s;itation increa&s;ed the power of temp|tation, the opportunity was &s;uch as might never occur again. He looked round, and as far as the trees opened &s;aw no per&s;on but the chevalier, who &s;eemed by his air to be a man of di&s;tinc|tion. Summoning all his courage, La Motte rode forward and attacked him. The Marquis de Montalt, for it was him, was unarmed but knowing that his attendants were not far off, he refu&s;ed to yield. While they were &s;truggling for victory, La Motte &s;aw &s;everal hor&s;emen enter the extremity of the avenue, and rendered de&s;perate by oppo&s;ition and delay, he drew from his pocket a pi&s;tol (which an apprehen&s;ion of banditti made him u&s;ually carry when he rode to a di&s;tance from the abbey) and fired at the Marquis, who &s;taggered and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground. La Motte had time to tear from his coat a brilliant &s;tar, &s;ome diamond rings from his fingers, and to rifle his poc|kets, before his attendants came up. In&s;tead of pur&s;uing the robber, they all in their fir&s;t confu&s;ion, flew to a&s;&s;i&s;t their lord, and La Motte e&s;caped.</P>
<P>He &s;topped before he reached the Abbey at a little ruin, the tomb formerly mentioned, to examine his booty. It con&s;i&s;ted of a pur&s;e containing &s;eventy louis d'ors; of a diamond &s;tar, three rings of great value, and a miniature &s;et with brilliants of the Marquis him&s;elf, which he had intended as a pre&s;ent for his favourite mi&s;tre&s;s. To La Motte, who but a few hours be|fore had &s;een him&s;elf nearly de&s;titute, the view of this trea&s;ure excited an almo&s;t ungovernable tran&s;port; but it was &s;oon checked when he remembered the means he had employed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o obtain it, and that he had paid for the wealth he contemplated the price of blood. Naturally violent in his pa&s;&s;ions, this re|flection &s;unk him from the &s;ummit of exultation to the aby&s;s of de&s;pondency. He con&s;idered him&s;elf a murderer, and &s;tartled
<PB N="131" REF="029379_0145_0FE08E4AB02A94E8">
as one awakened from a dream, would have given half the world, had it been his, to have been as poor, and comparatively, as guiltle&s;s as a few preceding hours had &s;een him. On ex|amining the portrait he di&s;covered the re&s;emblance, and believ|ing that his hand had deprived the original of life, he gazed upon the picture with unutterable angui&s;h. To the horrors of remor&s;e &s;ucceeded the perplexities of fear. Apprehen&s;ive of he knew not what, he lingered at the tomb, where he at length depo&s;ited his trea&s;ure, believing that if his offence &s;hould awa|ken ju&s;tice, the Abbey might be &s;earched, and tho&s;e jewels be|tray him. From Madame La Motte it was ea&s;y to conceal his increa&s;e of wealth; for as he had never made her acquainted with the exact &s;tate of his finances, &s;he had not &s;u&s;pected the extreme poverty which menaced him, and as they continued to live as u&s;ual, &s;he believed that their expen&s;es were drawn from the u&s;ual &s;upply. But it was not &s;o ea&s;y to di&s;gui&s;e the work|ings of remor&s;e and horror: his manner became gloomy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ved, and his frequent vi&s;its to the tomb, where he went partly to examine his trea&s;ure, but chiefly to indulge in the dreadful plea&s;ure of contemplating the picture of the Marquis, excited curio&s;ity. In the &s;olitude of the fore&s;t, where no variety of objects occurred to renovate his ideas, the horrible one of having committed murder was ever pre&s;ent to him.&mdash;When the Marquis arrived at the Abbey, the a&s;toni&s;hment and terror of La Motte, for at fir&s;t he &s;carce knew whether he beheld the &s;hadow or the &s;ub&s;tance of a human form, were quickly &s;uc|ceeded by apprehen&s;ion of the puni&s;hment due to the crime he had really committed. When his di&s;tre&s;s had prevailed on the Marquis to retire, he informed him that he was by birth a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">valier: he then touched upon &s;uch parts of his misfortunes as he thought would excite pity, expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch abhorrence of his guilt and voluntarily uttered &s;uch a &s;olemn promi&s;e of re|turning the jewels he had yet in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for he had ven|tured to di&s;po&s;e only of a &s;mall part, that the Marquis at length li&s;tened to him with &s;ome degree of compa&s;&s;ion. This favour|able &s;entiment, &s;econded by a &s;elfi&s;h motive, induced the Mar|quis to compromi&s;e with La Motte. Of quick and inflamma|ble pa&s;&s;ions, he had ob&s;erved the beauty of Adeline with an eye of no common regard, and he re&s;olved to &s;pare the life of La Motte upon no other condition than the &s;acrifice of this un|fortunate girl. La Motte had neither re&s;olution or virtue &s;uffi|cient to reject the terms&mdash;the jewels were re&s;tored, and he con|&s;ented to betray the innocent Adeline. But as he was too well
<PB N="132" REF="029379_0146_0FE08E54798288C0">
acquainted with her heart to believe that &s;he would ea&s;ily be won to the practice of vice, and as he &s;till felt a degree of pity and tenderne&s;s for her, he endeavoured to prevail on the Mar|quis to forbear precipitate mea&s;ures, and to attempt gradually to undermine her principles by &s;educing her affections. He ap|proved and adopted this plan: the failure of his fir&s;t &s;cheme induced him to employ the &s;tratagems he afterwards pur&s;ued, and thus to multiply the misfortunes of Adeline.</P>
<P>Such were the circum&s;tances which had brought La Motte to his pre&s;ent deplorable &s;ituation. The day of trial was now come, and he was led from pri&s;on into the court, where the Marquis appeared as his accu&s;er. When the charge was deliv|ered, La Motte, as is u&s;ual, pleaded not guilty, and the Advo|cate Nemours, who had undertaken to plead for him, after|wards endeavoured to make it appear that the accu&s;ation, on the part of the Marquis de Montalt, was fal&s;e and malicious. To this purpo&s;e he mentioned the circum&s;tance of the latter having attempted to per&s;uade his client to the murder of Ade|line: he farther urged that the Marquis had lived in habits of intimacy with La Motte for &s;everal months immediately pre|ceding his arre&s;t, and that it was not till he had di&s;appointed the de&s;igns of his accu&s;er, by conveying beyond his reach the unhappy object of his vengeance, that the Marquis had thought proper to charge La Motte with the crime for which he &s;tood indicted. Nemours urged the improbability of one man's keeping up a friendly intercour&s;e with another from whom he had &s;uffered the double injury of a&s;&s;ault and robbery; yet it was certain that the Marquis had ob&s;erved a frequent inter|cour&s;e with La Motte for &s;ome months following the time &s;pe|cified for the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime. If the Marquis intended to pro&s;ecute, why was it not immediately after his di&s;covery of La Motte? and if not then, what had influenced him to pro|&s;ecute at &s;o di&s;tant a period?</P>
<P>To this nothing was replied on the part of the Marquis; for as his conduct on this point had been &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ervient to his de&s;igns on Adeline, he could not ju&s;tify it but by expo&s;ing &s;chemes which would betray the darkne&s;s of his character, and invali|date his cau&s;e. He, therefore, contented him&s;elf with produc|ing &s;everal of his &s;ervants as witne&s;&s;es of the a&s;&s;ault and robbery, who &s;wore without &s;cruple to the per&s;on of La Motte, though not one of them had &s;een him other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e than through the gloom of evening and riding off at full &s;peed. On a cro&s;s examina|tion mo&s;t of them contradicted each ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their evidence was
<PB N="133" REF="029379_0146_0FE08E54798288C0">
of cour&s;e rejected; but as the Marquis had yet two other wit|ne&s;&s;es to produce, who&s;e arrival at Paris had been hourly expect|ed, the event of the trial was po&s;tponed, and the court adjourned.</P>
<P>La Motte was re-conducted to his pri&s;on under the &s;ame pre&s;&s;ure of de&s;pondency with which he had quitted it. As he walked through one of the avenues he pa&s;&s;ed a man who &s;tood by to let him proceed, and who regarded him with a fixed and earne&s;t eye. La Motte thought he had &s;een him before; but the imperfect view he caught of his features through the du&s;k|ne&s;s of the place made him uncertain as to this, and his mind was in too perturbated a &s;tate to &s;uffer him to feel an intere&s;t on the &s;ubject. When he was gone, the &s;tranger inquired of the keeper of the pri&s;on, who La Motte was; on being told, and receiving an&s;wers to &s;ome farther que&s;tions he put, he de|&s;ired he might be admitted to &s;peak with him. The reque&s;t, as the man was only a debtor, was granted, but as the doors were now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut up for the night, the interview was deferred till the morrow.</P>
<P>La Motte found Madame in his room where &s;he had been waiting for &s;ome hours to hear the event of the trial. They now wi&s;hed more earne&s;tly than ever to &s;ee their &s;on; but he was as they had &s;u&s;pected, ignorant of their change of quarters, owing to the letters which he had, as u&s;ual, addre&s;&s;ed to them under an a&s;&s;umed name, remaining at the po&s;t-hou&s;e of Auborn. This circum&s;tance occa&s;ioned Madame La Motte to addre&s;s her letters to the place of her &s;on's late re&s;idence, and he had thus continued ignorant of his father's misfortunes and removal. Madame La Motte, &s;urpri&s;ed at receiving no an&s;wers to her letters, &s;ent off another, containing an account of the trial as far as it had proceeded, and a reque&s;t that her &s;on would obtain leave of ab&s;ence, and &s;et out for Paris in&s;tantly. As &s;he was &s;till ignorant of the failure of her letters, and had it been other|wi&s;e, would not have known whither to have &s;ent them, &s;he directed this as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Mean while his approaching fate was never ab&s;ent for a mo|ment from the mind of La Motte, which feeble by nature, and &s;till more enervated by habits of indulgence, refu&s;ed to &s;upport him at this dreadful period.</P>
<P>While the&s;e &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enes were pa&s;&s;ing at Paris, La Luc arrived there without any acci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent after performing a journey, during which he had been &s;upported almo&s;t entirely by the &s;pirit of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;olu|tion.

<P>The fortitude with which he had &s;aid Theodore &s;upported his calamities was &s;omewhat exaggerated.

<P>La Luc waved his hand&mdash;"Alas!" &s;aid he, "I have noth|ing to tell but what you already gue&s;s too well. My poor The|odore!"&mdash;His voice was convul&s;ed with &s;orrow, and &s;ome mo|ments of unutterable angui&s;h followed.</P>
<P>Adeline was the fir&s;t who recovered &s;ufficient recollection to notice the extreme langour of La Luc, and attend to his &s;up|port. She ordered him refre&s;hments, and entreated he would retire to his bed and &s;uffer her to &s;end for a phy&s;ician; adding, that the fatigue he had &s;uffered made repo&s;e ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. "Would that I could find it my dear child," &s;aid he; "it is not in this world that I mu&s;t look for it, but in a better, and that better I tru&s;t, I &s;hall &s;oon attain. But where is our good friend, Louis La Motte; he mu&s;t lead me to my &s;on,"&mdash;Grief again interrupted his utterance, and the entrance of Louis was a very &s;ea&s;onable relief to them all. Their tears explained the que&s;tion he would have a&s;ked; La Luc immediately inquired for his &s;on, and thanking Louis for all his kindne&s;s to him, de|&s;ired to be conducted to the pri&s;on.

"I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to nece&s;&s;ity," &s;aid he; "I find I am not able to go farther to-night. Go to him, La Motte, and tell him I am &s;omewhat di&s;ordered by my jour|ney, but that I will be with him early in the morning. Do not flatter him with a hope; prepare him for the wor&s;t."&mdash;There was a pau&s;e of &s;ilence; La Luc at length recovering him&s;elf, de&s;ired Clara would order his bed to be got ready, and &s;he wil|lingly obeyed. When he withdrew, Adeline told Louis, what was indeed unnece&s;&s;ary, the event of La Luc's journey. "I own," continued &s;he, "that I had &s;ometimes &s;uffered my&s;elf to hope, and I now feel this calamity with double force. I fear too that M. La Luc will &s;ink under its pre&s;&s;ure; he is much altered for the wor&s;e &s;ince he &s;et out for Paris. Tell me your opinion &s;incerely."</P>
<P>The change was &s;o obvious, that Louis could not deny it, but he endeavoured to &s;ooth her apprehen&s;ion by a&s;cribing this alteration, in a great mea&s;ure, to the temporary fatigue of travel|ling. Adeline declared her re&s;olution of accompanying La Luc to take leave of Theodore in the morning. "I know not how I &s;hall &s;upport the interview." &s;aid &s;he; "but to &s;ee him once more is a duty I owe both to him and my&s;elf. The remem|brance of having neglected to give him this la&s;t proof of affection would pur&s;ue me with ince&s;&s;ant remor&s;e."</P>
<P>After &s;ome farther conver&s;ation on this &s;ubject Louis withdrew to the pri&s;on, ruminating on the be&s;t means of imparting to his friend the fatal intelligence he had to communicate. Theodore received it with more compo&s;ure than he had expected; but he a&s;ked, with impatience, why he did not &s;ee his father and Ade|line, and on being informed that indi&s;po&s;ition withheld them, his imagination &s;eized on the wor&s;t po&s;&s;ibility, and &s;ugge&s;ted that his father was dead. It was a con&s;iderable time before Louis could convince him of the contrary, and that Adeline was not dangereou&s;ly ill; when, however, he was a&s;&s;ured that he &s;hould &s;ee them in the morning, he became more tranquil. He de&s;ired his friend would not leave him that night. The&s;e are the la&s;t hours we can pa&s;s together," added he; "I cannot &s;leep! Stay with me and lighten their heavy moments, I have need of comfort, Louis. Young as I am, and held by &s;uch &s;trong at|tachments, I cannot quit the world with re&s;ignation. I know not how to credit the&s;e &s;tories we hear of philo&s;ophic fortitude&punc; wi&s;dom cannot teach us cheerfully to re&s;ign a good, and life in my circum&s;tances is &s;urely &s;uch.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="029379_0148_0FE08E69CA16AC10">The night was pa&s;&s;ed in embarra&s;&s;ed conver&s;ation; &s;ome|times interrupted by long fits of &s;ilence, and &s;ometimes by the paroxy&s;ms of de&s;pair; and the morning of that day which was to lead Theodore to death at length dawned through the grates of his pri&s;on.</P>
<P>La Luc mean while pa&s;&s;ed a &s;leeple&s;s and dreadful night. He prayed for fortitude and re&s;ignation both for him&s;elf and Theo|dore; but the pangs of nature were powerful in his heart, and not to be &s;ubdued. The idea of his lamented wife, and of what &s;he would have &s;uffered had &s;he lived to witne&s;s the igno|minious death which awaited her &s;on, frequently occurred to him.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed as if a de&s;tiny had hung over the life of Theodore, for it is probable that the king might have granted the petition of the unhappy father, had it not happened that the Marquis de Montalt was pre&s;ent a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> court when the paper was pre&s;ented. The appearance and &s;ingular di&s;tre&s;s of the petitioner had inter|re&s;ted the monarch, and, in&s;tead of putting by the paper, he opened it. As he threw his eyes over it, ob&s;erving that the crim|inal was of the Marquis de Montalt's regiment: he turned to him and inquired the nature of the offence for which the culprit was about to &s;uffer. The an&s;wer was &s;uch as might have been expected from the Marquis, and the king was convinced that Theodore was not a proper object of mercy.</P>
<P>But to return to La Luc, who was called according to his or|der, at a very early hour. Having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in prayer, he went down to the parlour where Louis punctual to the moment, already waited to conduct him to the pri&s;on. He ap|peared calm and collected, but his countenance was impre&s;&s;ed with a fixed de&s;pair that &s;en&s;ibly affected his young friend. While they waited for Adeline he &s;poke little, and &s;eemed &s;truggling to attain the fortitude nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport him through the ap|proaching &s;cene. Adeline not appearing, he at length &s;ent to ha&s;ten her, and was told &s;he had been ill, but was recovering. She had indeed pa&s;&s;ed a night of &s;uch agitation, that her frame had &s;unk under it, and &s;he was now endeavouring to recover &s;trength and compo&s;ure &s;ufficient to &s;u&s;tain her in this dreadful hour. Every moment that brought her nearer to it had increa&s;|ed her emotion, and the apprehen&s;ion of being prevented &s;eeing Theodore, had alone enabled her to &s;truggle again&s;t the united pre&s;&s;ure of il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s and grief.</P>
<P>She now, with Clara, joined La Luc, who advanced as they entered the room, and took a hand of each in &s;ilence. After &s;ome moments he propo&s;ed to go, and they &s;tepped into a car|riage
<PB N="138" REF="029379_0149_0FE08E6E8001C908">
which conveyed them to the gates of the pri&s;on. The crowd had already began to a&s;&s;emble there, and a confu&s;ed mur|mer aro&s;e as the carriage moved forward; it was a grevious fight to the friends of Theodore. Louis &s;upported Adeline when &s;he alighted, &s;he was &s;carcely able to walk, and with trembling &s;teps &s;he followed La Luc, whom the keeper led towards that part of the pri&s;on where his &s;on was confined. It was now eight o'clock, the &s;entence was not to be executed till twelve, but a guard of &s;oldiers was already placed in the court, and as this unhappy party pa&s;&s;ed along the narrow avenues they were met by &s;everal officers who had been to take a la&s;t farewell of Theodore. As they a&s;cended the &s;tairs that led to his apartment, La Luc's ear caught the clink of chains, and heard him walking above with a quick irregular &s;tep. The unhappy father, overcome by the moment which now pre&s;&s;ed upon him, &s;topped and was oblig|ed to &s;upport him&s;elf by the bani&s;ter. Louis fearing the con|&s;equence of his grief might be fatal, &s;hattered as his frame alrea|dy was, would have gone for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but he made a &s;ign to him to &s;tay. "I am better;" &s;aid La Luc, "O God! &s;upport me through this hour!" and in a few moments he was able to proceed.</P>
<P>As the warder unlocked the door, the har&s;h grating of the key &s;hocked Adeline, but in the next moment &s;he was in the pre&s;ence of Theodore who &s;prung to meet her, and caught her in his arms before &s;he &s;unk to the ground. As her head reclined on his &s;houlder, he again viewed that countenance &s;o dear to him, which had &s;o often lighted rapture in his heart, and which, though pale and inanimate as it now was, awakened him to momentary delight. When at length &s;he unclo&s;ed her eyes, &s;he fixed them in long and mournful gaze upon Theodore, who pre&s;&s;ing her to his heart, could an&s;wer her only with a &s;mile of mingled tenderne&s;s and de&s;pair; the tears he endea|voured to re&s;train trembled in his eyes, and he forgot for a time every thing but Adeline. La Luc who had &s;eated him|&s;elf at the foot of the bed, &s;eemed uncon&s;cious of what pa&s;&s;ed around him, and entirely ab&s;orbed in his own grief; but Clara, as &s;he cla&s;ped the hand of her brother, and hung weeping on his arm, expre&s;&s;ed aloud all the angui&s;h of her heart, and at length recalled the attention of Adeline, who in a voice &s;carcely audible entreated &s;he would &s;pare her father. Her words rou&s;ed Theodore, and &s;upporting Adeline to a chair, he turned to La Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "My dear child!" &s;aid La Luc, gra&s;ping his hand and bur&s;ting into tears, "My dear child!" They wept together. After a long interval of &s;ilence, he &s;aid, "I thought I could have &s;up|ported
<PB N="139" REF="029379_0149_0FE08E6E8001C908">
this hour, but I am old and feeble. God knows my efforts for re&s;ignation, my faith in his goodne&s;s!"</P>
<P>Theodore by a &s;trong and &s;udden exertion, a&s;&s;umed a compo&s;|ed and firm countenance, and endeavoured by every gentle argu|ment to &s;ooth and comfort his weeping friends. La Luc at length &s;eemed to conquer his &s;ufferings; drying his eyes, he &s;aid, "My &s;on, I ought to have &s;et you a better example, and prac|ti&s;ed the precepts of fortitude I have &s;o often given you. But it is over; I know, and will perform my duty." Adeline breathed a heavy &s;igh, and continued to weep. "Be comforted, my love, we part but for a time," &s;aid Theodore as he ki&s;&s;ed the tears from her cheek; and uniting her hand with that of his father's, he earne&s;tly recommended her to his protection. "Receive her," added he, "as the mo&s;t precious legacy I can bequeath; con&s;ider her as your child. She will con&s;ole you when I am gone, &s;he will more than &s;upply the lo&s;s of your &s;on."</P>
<P>La Luc a&s;&s;ured him that he did now, and &s;hould continue to, regard Adeline as his daughter. During tho&s;e afflicting hours he endeavoured to di&s;&s;ipate the terrors of approaching death by in&s;piring his &s;on with religious confidence. His conver&s;ation was pious, rational and con&s;olatory: he &s;poke not from the cold dictates of the head, but from the feelings of a heart which had long loved and practi&s;ed the pure precepts of chri&s;tianity, and which now drew from them a comfort &s;uch as nothing earthly could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>"You are young, my &s;on," &s;aid he, "and are yet innocent of any great crime; you may therefore look on death without ter|ror, for to the guilty only is his approach dreadful. I feel that I &s;hall not long &s;urvive you, and I tru&s;t in a merciful God that we &s;hall meet in a &s;tate where &s;orrow never comes; <HI>where the Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall come with healing in his wing!</HI>" As he &s;poke he looked up; the tears &s;till trembled in his eyes, which beamed with meek yet fervent devotion, and his countenance glowed with the dignity of a &s;uperior being.</P>
<P>"Let us not neglect the awful moments," &s;aid La Luc, ri&s;ing, "let our united prayers a&s;cend to Him who alone can comfort and &s;upport us!" They all knelt down, and he prayed with that &s;imple and &s;ublime eloquence which true piety in&s;pires. When he ro&s;e he embraced his children &s;eparately, and when he came to Theodore he pau&s;ed, gazed upon him with an earne&s;t, mourn|ful expre&s;&s;ion, and was for &s;ometime unable to &s;peak. Theodore could not bear this; he drew his hand before his eyes, and vainly endeavoured to &s;tifle the deep &s;obs which convul&s;ed his frame.
<PB N="140" REF="029379_0150_0FE08E7BCB1EDCE0">
At length recovering his voice, he entreated his father would leave him. "This mi&s;ery is too much for us all," &s;aid he, "let us not prolong it. The time it now drawing on&mdash;leave me to compo&s;e my&s;elf. The &s;harpne&s;s of death con&s;i&s;ts in parting with tho&s;e who are dear to us; when that is pa&s;&s;ed death is di&s;armed."</P>
<P>"I will not leave you, my &s;on," replied La Luc, "My poor girl &s;hall go, but for me I will be with you in your la&s;t moments." Theodore felt that this would be too much for them both, and urged every argument which rea&s;on could &s;ugge&s;t to prevail with his father to relinqui&s;h his de&s;ign. But he remained firm in his determination. "I will not &s;uffer a &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ideration of the pain I may endure," &s;aid La Luc, "to tempt me to de&s;ert my child when he will mo&s;t require my &s;upport. It is my duty to attend you, and nothing &s;hall withhold me."</P>
<P>Theodore &s;eized on the words of La Luc: "As you would that I &s;hould be &s;upported in my la&s;t hour," &s;aid he, "I entreat that you will not be witne&s;s of it. Your pre&s;ence, my dear father, would &s;ubdue all my fortitude; would de&s;troy what little com|po&s;ure I may otherwi&s;e be able to attain. Add not to my &s;uffer|ings the view of your di&s;tre&s;s, but leave me to forget, if po&s;&s;ible, the dear parent I mu&s;t quit for ever." His tears flowed anew. La Luc continued to gaze on him in &s;ilent agony; at length he &s;aid, "Well, be it &s;o. If indeed my pre&s;ence would di&s;tre&s;s you, I will not go." His voice was broken and interrupted. After a pau&s;e of &s;ome moments he again embraced Theodore: "We mu&s;t part," &s;aid he, "we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> part, but it is only for a tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: we &s;hall &s;oon be re-united in a higher world! O God! thou &s;ee&s;t my heart; thou &s;ee&s;t all its feelings in this bitter hour!" Grief again overcame him. He pre&s;&s;ed Theodore in his arms; and at length, &s;eeming to &s;ummon all his fortitude, he again &s;aid, "We <HI>mu&s;t</HI> part: Oh! my &s;on, farewell for ever in this world! The mercy of almighty God &s;upport and ble&s;s you!"</P>
<P>He turned away to leave the pri&s;on, but quite worn out with grief, &s;unk into a chair near the door he would have opened. Theodore gazed, with a di&s;tracted countenance, alternately on his father&punc; on Clara, and on Adeline whom he pre&s;&s;ed to his throb|bing heart, and their tears flowed together. "And do I then," cried he, "for the la&s;t time look upon that countenance! Shall I never, never more behold it? O! exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery! Yet once again, once more," continued he, pre&s;&s;ing her cheek, but it was in&s;en&s;ible and cold as marble.</P>
<P>Louis, who had left the room &s;oon after La Luc arrived, that his pre&s;ence might not interrupt their farewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l grief, now return|ed.
<PB N="141" REF="029379_0150_0FE08E7BCB1EDCE0">
Adeline rai&s;ed her head, and perceiving who entered, it again &s;unk on the bo&s;om of Theodore.</P>
<P>Louis appeared much agitated. La Luc aro&s;e. "We mu&s;t go," &s;aid he: "Adeline, my love, exert your&s;elf; Clara, my children, let us depart. Yet one la&s;t, la&s;t embrace, and then!" &mdash;Louis advanced and took his hand; "My dear Sir, I have &s;omething to &s;ay; yet I fear to tell it." "What do you mean?" &s;aid La Luc, with quickne&s;s: "No new misfortune can have power to afflict me at this moment. Do not fear to &s;peak." "I rejoice that I cannot put you to the proof." replied Louis; "I have &s;een you &s;u&s;tain the mo&s;t trying affliction with fortitude. Can you &s;upport the tran&s;ports of hope?" La Luc gazed eagerly on Louis. "Speak!" &s;aid he, in a faint voice. Adeline rai&s;ed her head, and trembling between hope and fear, looked at Louis as if &s;he would have &s;earched his &s;oul. He &s;miled cheerfully upon her. "Is it: O! Is it po&s;&s;ible!" &s;he exclaimed, &s;uddenly re-animated. "He lives! He lives!" She &s;aid no more, but ran to La Luc, who &s;unk fainting in his chair, while Theodore and Clara with one voice called on Louis to relieve them from the tortures of &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>He proceeded to inform them that he had obtained from the commanding officer a re&s;pite for Theodore till the king's farther plea&s;ure could be known, and this in con&s;equence of a letter re|ceived that morning from his mother, Madame de la Motte, in which &s;he mentioned &s;ome very extraordinary circum&s;tances that had appeared in the cour&s;e of a trial lately coducted at Paris, and which &s;o materially affected the character of the Marquis de Montalt as to render it po&s;&s;ible a pardon might be obtained for Theodore.</P>
<P>The&s;e words darted with the rapidity of lightning upon the hearts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f his hearers. La Luc revived, and that pri&s;on &s;o lately the &s;ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of de&s;pair now echoed only to the voice of gratitude and gladne&s;s. La Luc, rai&s;ing his cla&s;ped hands to Heaven, &s;aid, "Great God, &s;upport me in this moment, as thou ha&s;t already &s;upported me!&mdash;If my &s;on lives, I die in peace."</P>
<P>He embraced Theodore, and remembering the angui&s;h of his la&s;t embrace, tears of thankfulne&s;s and joy flowed to the con|tra&s;t. So powerful indeed was the effect of this temporary re|prieve, and of the hope it introduced, that if an ab&s;olute pardon had been obtained, it could &s;carcely for the moment had diffu|&s;ed a more lively joy. But when the fir&s;t emotions were &s;ub|&s;ided, the uncertainty of Theodore's fate once more appeared. Adeline forbore to expre&s;s this, but Clara without &s;cruple la|mented the po&s;&s;ibility that her brother might yet be taken from

them, and all their joy be turned to &s;orrow. A look from Ade|line checked her. Joy was, however, &s;o much the predominant feeling of the pre&s;ent moment, that the &s;hade which reflection threw upon their hopes pa&s;&s;ed away like the cloud that is di&s;|pelled by the &s;trength of the &s;unbeam; and Louis alone was pen&s;ive and ab&s;tracted.</P>
<P>When they were &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed, he informed them that the contents of Madame La Motte's letter obliged him to &s;et out for Paris immediately&punc; and that the intelligence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e had to communicate intimately concerned Adeline, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> undoubtedly judge it nece&s;&s;ary to go thither al&s;o as &s;oon as her health would permit. He then read to his impatient auditors &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages in the letter as were nece&s;&s;ary to explain his mean|ing; but as Madame de la Motte had omitted to mention &s;ome circum&s;tances of importance to be under&s;tood, the following is a relation of the occurrences that had lately happened at Paris.</P>
<P>It may be remembered, that on the fir&s;t day of the trial, La Motte, in pa&s;&s;ing from the courts to his pri&s;on, &s;aw a per&s;on who&s;e features, though imperfectly &s;een through the du&s;k, he thought he recollected; and that this &s;ame per&s;on, after inquir|ing the name of La Motte, de&s;ired to be admitted to him. On the following day the warder complied with his reque&s;t, and the &s;urpri&s;e of La Motte may be imagined when, in the &s;tronger light of his apartment, he di&s;tingui&s;hed the countenance of the man from who&s;e hands he had formerly received Adeline.</P>
<P>On ob&s;erving Madame de la Motte in the room, he &s;aid, he had &s;omething of con&s;equence to impart, and de&s;ired to be left alone with the pri&s;oner. When &s;he was gone, he told de la Motte that he under&s;tood he was confined at the &s;uit of the Marquis de Montalt. La Motte a&s;&s;ented.&mdash;"I know him for a villain &s;aid the &s;tranger boldly. "Your ca&s;e is de&s;perate. Do you wi&s;h for life?"</P>
<P>"Need the que&s;tion be a&s;ked!"</P>
<P>"Your trial, I under&s;tand, proceeds to-morrow. I am now under confinement in this place for debt; but if you can obtain leave for me to go with you into the courts, and a condition from the judge that what I reveal &s;hall not crimitate my&s;elf, I will make di&s;coveries that &s;hall confound that &s;ame Marquis; I will prove him a villain; and it &s;hall then be judged how far his word ought to be taken again&s;t you."</P>
<P>La Motte, who&s;e intere&s;t was now &s;trongly excited, de&s;ired he would explain him&s;elf&punc; and the man proceeded to relate a long hi&s;tory of the misfortunes and con&s;equent poverty which had
<PB N="143" REF="029379_0151_0FE08E80884DFA00">
tempted him to become &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;chemes of the Mar|quis, till he &s;uddenly checked him&s;elf, and &s;aid, "When I ob|tain from the court the promi&s;e I require, I will explain my&s;elf fully; till then I cannot &s;ay more on the &s;ubject."</P>
<P>La Motte could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing a doubt of his &s;inceri|ty, and a curio&s;ity concerning the motive that had induced him to become the Marquis's accu&s;er&mdash;"As to my motive it is a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ral one," replied the man: it is no ea&s;y matter to receive ill u&s;age without re&s;enting it, particularly from a villain whom you have &s;erved."&mdash;La Motte, for his own &s;ake, endeavoured to check the vehemence with which this was uttered. I care not who hears me," continued the &s;tranger, but at the &s;ame time he lowered his voice; "I repeat it&mdash;the Marquis has u&s;ed me ill&mdash;I have kept his &s;ecret long enough. He does not think it worth while to &s;ecure my &s;ilence, or he would relieve my ne|ce&s;&s;ities. I am in pri&s;on for debt, and have applied to him for relief: &s;ince he does not chu&s;e to give it, let him take the con|&s;equence. I warrant he &s;hall &s;oon repent that he has provoked me, and 'tis fit he &s;hould."</P>
<P>The doubts of La Motte were now di&s;&s;ipated; the pro&s;pect of life again opened upon him, and he a&s;&s;ured Du Bo&s;&s;e (which was the &s;tranger's name) with much warmth, that he would com|mi&s;&s;ion his advocate to do all in his power to obtain leave for his appearance on the trial, and to procure the nece&s;&s;ary condi|tion, After &s;ome farther conver&s;ation they parted.</P>

<P>LEAVE was at length granted for the appearance of Du Bo&s;|&s;e, with a promi&s;e that his words &s;hould not criminate him, and he accompanied La Motte into court.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of the Marquis de Montalt on perceiving this man was ob&s;erved by many per&s;ons pre&s;ent, and particularly by La Motte, who drew from this circum&s;tance a favourable pre&s;age for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When Du Bo&s;&s;e was called upon, he informed the court, that on the night of the twenty-fir&s;t of April in the preceding year, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Jean d'Aunoy, a man he had known many years, came to
<PB N="144" REF="029379_0152_0FE08E8D01A70110">
his lodging. After they had di&s;cour&s;ed for &s;ome time on their circum&s;tances, d'Aunoy &s;aid he knew a way by which Du Bo&s;&s;e might change all his poverty into riches, but that he would not &s;ay more till he was certain he would be willing to follow it. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate in which Du Bo&s;&s;e then was, made him anx|ious to learn the means which would bring him relief; he ea|gerly inquired what his friend meant, and after &s;ome time d'Au|noy explained him&s;elf. He &s;aid he was employed by a nobleman (who he afterwards told Du Bo&s;&s;e was the Marquis de Montalt) to carry off a young girl from a convent, and that &s;he was to be, taken to a hou&s;e at a few leagues di&s;tant from Paris. "I knew the hou&s;e he de&s;cribed well," &s;aid Du Bo&s;&s;e, "for I had been there many times with d'Aunoy, who lived there to avoid his creditors, though he often pa&s;&s;ed his nights at Paris." He would not tell me more of the &s;cheme, but &s;aid he &s;hould want a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and if I and my brother, who is &s;ince dead, would join him, his employer would grudge no money, and we &s;hould be well rewarded. I de&s;ired him again to tell me more of the plan, but he was ob&s;tinate, and after I had told him I would con|&s;ider of what he had &s;aid and &s;peak to my brother, he went away.</P>
<P>When he called the next night for his an&s;wer, my brother and I agreed to engage, and accordingly we went home with him. He then told us that the young lady he was to bring thither was a natural daughter of the Marquis de Montalt, and of a nun be|longing to a convent of Ur&s;alines; that his wife had received the child immediately on its birth, and had been allowed a hand|&s;ome annuity to bring it up as her own, which &s;he had done till her death. The child was then placed in a convent and de&s;igned for the veil; but when &s;he was of an age to receive the vows, &s;he had &s;teadily per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing them. This circum&s;tance had &s;o much exa&s;perated the Marquis, that in his rage he order|ed, that if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in her ob&s;tinacy &s;he &s;hould be removed from the convent, and got rid of any way, &s;ince if &s;he lived in the world her birth might be di&s;covered, and in con&s;equence of this, her mother for whom he had yet a regard, would be con|demned to expatiate her crime by a terrible death."</P>
<P>Du Bo&s;&s;e was interrupted in his narrative by the council of the Marquis, who contended that the circum&s;tances alleged tending to criminate his client, the proceeding was both irrelevant and illegal. He was an&s;wered that it was not irrelevant, and there|fore not illegal, for that the circum&s;tances which threw light upon the character of the Marquis, affected his evidence again&s;t La Motte. Du Bo&s;&s;e was &s;uffered to proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="029379_0152_0FE08E8D01A70110">"D' Aunoy then &s;aid that the Marquis had ordered him to di&s;patch her, but that as he had been u&s;ed to &s;ee her from her in|fancy, he could not find in his heart to do it, and wrote to tell him &s;o. The Marquis then commanded him to &s;end tho&s;e who would, and this was the bu&s;ine&s;s for which he wanted us. My brother and I were not &s;o wicked as this came to, and &s;o we told d'Aunoy, and I could not help a&s;king why the Marquis re|&s;olved to murder his own child rather than expo&s;e her mother to the ri&s;que of &s;uffering death. He &s;aid the Marquis had never &s;een his child, and that therefore it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed he felt much kindne&s;s towards it, and &s;till le&s;s that he could love it bet|ter than he loved its mother."</P>
<P>Du Bo&s;&s;e proceeded to relate how much he and his brother had endeavoured to &s;often the heart of d'Aunoy towards the Marquis's daughter, and that they prevailed with him to write again and plead for her. D'Aunoy went to Paris to await the an&s;wer, leaving them and the young girl at the hou&s;e on the heath, where the former had con&s;ented to remain, &s;eemingly for the purpo&s;e of executing the orders they might receive, but re|ally with a de&s;ign to &s;ave the unhappy victim from the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>It is probable that Du Bo&s;&s;e, in this in&s;tance, gave a fal&s;e ac|count of his motive, &s;ince if he was really guilty of an intention &s;o atrocious as that of murder, he would naturally endeavour to conceal it. However this might be, he affirmed that on the night of the twenty &s;ixth of April, he received an order from d'Aunoy for the di&s;truction of the girl whom he had afterwards delivered into the hands of La Motte.</P>
<P>La Motte li&s;tened to this relation in a&s;toni&s;hment; when he knew that Adeline was the daughter of the Marquis, and re|membered the crime to which he had once devoted her, his frame thrilled with horror. He now took up the &s;tory, and added an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed at the Abbey between the Marquis and him&s;elf concerning a de&s;ign of the former upon the life of Adeline; and urged, as a proof of the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution originating in malice, that it had commenced immediately after he had effected her e&s;cape from the Marquis. He concluded, however, with &s;aying, that as the Marquis had immediately &s;ent his people in pur&s;uit of her, it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might yet have fallen a victim to his vengeance.</P>
<P>Here the Marquis's council again interferred and their objec|tions were again overruled by the court. The uncommon de|gree of emotion which his countenance betrayed during the narrations of Du Bo&s;&s;e and De La Motte, was generally ob&s;erv|ed.
<PB N="146" REF="029379_0153_0FE08E92FA61BD60">
The court &s;u&s;pended the &s;entence of the latter, ordered that the Marquis &s;hould be put under immediate arre&s;t, and that Adeline (the name given by her fo&s;ter mother) and Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Au|noy &s;hould be &s;ought for.</P>
<P>The Marquis was accordingly &s;eized at the &s;uit of the crown, and put under confinement till Adeline &s;hould appear, or proof could be obtained that &s;he died by his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der, and till d'Aunoy &s;hould confirm or de&s;troy the evide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of De La Motte.</P>
<P>Madame, who at length ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d intelligence of her &s;ons re|&s;idence from the town w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was formerly &s;tationed, had ac|quainted him with his father's &s;ituation, and the proceedings of the trial; and as &s;he believed that Adeline, if &s;he had been &s;o for|tunate as to e&s;cape the Marquis's pur&s;uit, was &s;till in Savoy, &s;he de&s;ired Louis would obtain leave of ab&s;cence, and bring her to Pa|ris, where her immediate pre&s;ence was requi&s;ite to &s;ub&s;tanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te the evidence and probably to &s;ave the life of La Motte.</P>
<P>On the receipt of her letter, which happened on the morning appointed for the execution of Theodore, Louis went immediate|ly to the commanding officer to petition for a re&s;pite till the king's further plea&s;ure &s;hould be known. He founded his plea on the arre&s;t of the Marquis, and &s;hewed the letter he had ju&s;t received.

<P>ON learning the purpo&s;e of Madame de la Motte's letter Adeline &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of her immediate departure for Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The life of La Motte, who had more than &s;aved her's, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; perhaps of her beloved Theodore, depended on the te&s;timony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould give. And &s;he who had &s;o lately been &s;inking under the influence of illne&s;s and de&s;pair, who could &s;carcely rai&s;e her la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|guid head, or &s;peak but in the fainte&s;t accents, now re-anim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with hope, and invigorated by a &s;en&s;e of the importance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bu&s;ine&s;s before her, prepared to perform a rapid journey of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hundred miles.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="029379_0153_0FE08E92FA61BD60">Theodore tenderly entreated that &s;he would &s;o far con&s;ider her health as to delay this journey for a few days; but with a &s;mile of enchanting tenderne&s;s &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he was now too happy to be ill&punc; and that the &s;ame cau&s;e which would con|firm her happine&s;s would confirm her health. So &s;trong was the effect of hope upon her mind now, that it &s;ucceeded to the mi&s;|ery of de&s;pair, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vercame the &s;hock &s;he &s;uffered on believ|ing her&s;elf a daughter of the Marquis, and every other painful reflection. She did not ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the ob&s;tacle that circum|&s;tance might produce to her u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with Theodore, &s;hould he at la&s;t be permitted to live.</P>
<P>It was &s;ettled that &s;he &s;hould &s;et o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Paris in a few hours with Louis, and attended by Peter. The&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs were pa&s;&s;ed by La Luc and his family in the pri&s;on.</P>
<P>When the time of her departure arrived, the &s;pirits of Adeline again for&s;ook her, and the illu&s;ions of joy di&s;appeared. She no longer beheld&punc; Theodore as one re&s;pited from death, but took leave of him with a mournful pre-&s;entiment that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him no more. So &s;trongly was this pre&s;age impre&s;&s;ed upon her mind, that it was long before &s;he could &s;ummon re&s;olution to bid him farewell; and when &s;he had done &s;o, and even left the apartment, &s;he returned to take of him a la&s;t look. As &s;he was once more quitting the room, her melancholy imagina|tion repre&s;ented Theodore at the place of execution, pale and convul&s;ed in death; &s;he again turned her lingering eyes upon him; but fancy affected her &s;en&s;e, for &s;he thought as &s;he now gazed that his countenance changed and a&s;&s;umed a gha&s;tly hue. All her re&s;olution vani&s;hed, and &s;uch was the angui&s;h of her heart, that &s;he re&s;olved to defer her journey till the morrow, though &s;he mu&s;t by this means lo&s;e the projection of Louis, who&s;e impa|tience to meet his father would not &s;uffer the delay. The tri|umph of pa&s;&s;ion, however, was tran&s;ient; &s;oothed by the indul|gence &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf, her grief &s;ub&s;ided, rea&s;on re&s;umed its, influence; &s;he again &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of her immediate depar|ture, and recollected &s;ufficient re&s;olution to &s;ubmit. La Luc would have accompanied her for the purpo&s;e of again &s;oliciting the King in behalf of his &s;on, had not the extreme weakne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itude to which he was reduced made travelling impracticable.</P>
<P>At length, Adeline, with a heavy heart quitted Theodore, notwith&s;tanding his entreaties that &s;he would not undertake the journey in her pre&s;ent weak &s;tate, and was accompanied by Clara and La Luc to the inn. The former parted from her friend with many tears and much anxiety for her welfare, but under a
<PB N="148" REF="029379_0154_0FE08E9FF321B8C0">
hope of &s;oon meeting again. Should a pardon be granted to Theodore, La Luc de&s;igned to fetch Adeline from Paris; but &s;hould this be refu&s;ed, &s;he was to return with Peter. He bade her adieu with a father's kindne&s;s, which &s;he repaid with a filial affection, and in her la&s;t words conjured him to attend to the re|covery of his health: the languid &s;mile he a&s;&s;umed &s;eemed to expre&s;s that her &s;olicitude was vain, and that he thought his health pa&s;t recovery.</P>
<P>Thus Adeline quitted the friends &s;o ju&s;tly dear to her, and &s;o lately found, for Paris, where &s;he was a &s;tranger, almo&s;t without protection, and compelled to meet a father who had pur&s;ued her with the utmo&s;t cruelty, in a public court of ju&s;tice. The car|riage in leaving Vacea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;ed by the pri&s;on; &s;he threw an eager look towards it as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed; its heavy black walls, and nar|row-grated windows, &s;eemed to frown upon her hopes, but The|odore was there, and leaning from the window, &s;he continued to gaze upon it till an abrupt turning in the &s;treet concealed it from her view. She then &s;unk back in the carriage, and yielding to the melancholy of her heart, wept&punc; in &s;ilence. Louis was not di&s;po&s;ed to interrupt it; his thoughts were anxiou&s;ly employed on his father's &s;ituation and the travellers proceeded many miles without exchanging a word.</P>
<P>At Paris, whither we &s;hall now return, the &s;earch after Jea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> d'Aunoy was pro&s;ecuted without &s;ucce&s;s. The hou&s;e on the heath, de&s;cribed by du Bo&s;&s;e, was found uninhabited, and to the places of his u&s;ual re&s;ort in the city, where the officers of the pol|ice awaited him, he no longer came. It even appeared doubtful whether he was living, for he had ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the hou&s;es of his cu&s;tomary rendezvous &s;ome time before the trial of La Motte; it was therefore certain that his ab&s;ence was not oc|ca&s;ioned by any thing which had pa&s;&s;ed in the courts.</P>
<P>In the &s;olitude of his confinement the Marquis had lei&s;ure to reflect on the pa&s;t, and to repent of his crimes; but reflection and repentance formed as yet no part of his di&s;po&s;ition. He turned with impatience from recollections which produced only pain, and looked forward to the future with an endeavour to avert the di&s;grace and puni&s;hment which he &s;aw impending. The ele|gance of his manners had &s;o effectually veiled the depravity of his heart, that he was a favourite with his &s;overeign; and on this circum&s;tance he re&s;ted his hope of &s;ecurity. He, however, &s;evere|ly repented that he had indulged the ha&s;ty &s;pirit of revenge which had urged him to pro&s;ecute La Motte, and had thus unexpectedly involved him in a &s;ituation dangerous, if not fatal; &s;ince if Ade|line
<PB N="149" REF="029379_0154_0FE08E9FF321B8C0">
could not be found he would be concluded guilty of her death. But the appearance of d'Aunoy was the circum&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e mo&s;t dreaded; and to oppo&s;e the po&s;&s;ibility of this, he em|ployed &s;ecret emi&s;&s;aries to di&s;cover his retreat, and to bribe him to his intere&s;t. The&s;e were, however, as un&s;ucce&s;sful in their re&s;earch as the officers of the police, and the Marquis at length began to hope the man was really dead.</P>
<P>La Motte mean while awaited with trembling impatience the arrival of his &s;on, when he &s;hould be relieved, in &s;ome degree from his uncertainty concerning Adeline. On his appearance he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed his only hope of life, &s;ince the evidence again&s;t him would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> much of its validity from the confirmation &s;he would give of the bad character of his pro&s;ecutor; and if the Parliament even condemned La Motte, the clemency of the King might yet ope|rate in his favour.</P>
<P>Adeline arrived at Paris after a journey of &s;everal days, during which &s;he was chiefly &s;upported by the delicate attentions of Louis whom &s;he pitied and e&s;teemed, though &s;he could not love. She was immediately vi&s;ited at the hotel by Madame La Motte: the meeting was affecting on both &s;ides. A &s;en&s;e of her pa&s;t con|duct excited in the latter an embarra&s;&s;ment which the delicacy and goodne&s;s of Adeline would willingly have &s;pared her; but the pardon &s;olicited was given with &s;o much &s;incerity, that Ma|dame gradually became compo&s;ed and re-a&s;&s;ured. This forgive|ne&s;s, however, could not have been thus ea&s;ily granted, had Ade|line believed her former conduct was voluntary; a conviction of the re&s;traint and terror under which Madame had acted, alone induced her to excu&s;e the pa&s;t. In this fir&s;t meeting they forbore dwelling on particuler &s;ubjects; Madame La Motte propo&s;ed that Adeline &s;hould remove from the hotel to her lodgings near the Chatelet, and Adeline, for whom a re&s;idence at a public hotel was very improper, gladly accepted the offer.</P>
<P>Madame there gave her a circum&s;tantial account of La Mot|te's &s;ituation, and concluded with &s;aying, that as the &s;entence of her hu&s;band had been &s;u&s;pended till &s;ome certainty could be ob|tained containing the late criminal de&s;igns of the Marquis, and as Adeline could confirm the chief part of La Motte's te&s;timony, it was probable that now &s;he was arrived the Court would pro|ceed immediately. She now learnt the full extent of her obliga|tion to La Motte; for &s;he was till now ignorant that when he &s;ent her from the fore&s;t he &s;aved her from death. Her horror of the Marquis whom &s;he could not bear to con&s;ider as her father, and her gratitude to her deliverer, redoubled, and &s;he became
<PB N="150" REF="029379_0155_0FE069A0AC03AB70">
impatient to give the te&s;timony &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the hopes of her pre&s;erver. Madame then &s;aid, &s;he believed it was not too late to gain admittance that night to the Chatelet; and as &s;he knew how an|xiou&s;ly her hu&s;band wi&s;hed to &s;ee Adeline, &s;he entreated her con|&s;ent to go thither. Adeline, though much harra&s;&s;ed and fatigued, complied. When Louis returned from M. Nemour's, his father's advocate, whom he had ha&s;tened to inform of her arrival, they all &s;et out for the Chatelet. The view of the pri&s;on into which they were now admitted &s;o forcibly recalled to Adeline's mind the &s;ituation of Theodore, that &s;he with difficulty &s;upported her|&s;elf to the apartment of La Motte. When he &s;aw her, a gleam of joy pa&s;&s;ed over his countenance; but again relap&s;ing into de&s;|pondency, he looked mournfully at her, and then at Louis, and groaned deeply. Adeline, in whom all remembrance of his for|mer cruelty was lo&s;t in his &s;ub&s;equent kindne&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed her thankfulne&s;s for the life he had pre&s;erved, and her anxiety to &s;ave him, in warm and repeated terms. But her gratitude evi|dently di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him; in&s;tead of reconciling him to him&s;elf, it &s;eemed to awaken a remembrance of the guilty de&s;igns he had once a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and to &s;trike the pangs of con&s;cience deeper in his heart. Endeavouring to conceal his emotions, he entered on the &s;ubject of his pre&s;ent danger, and informed Adeline what te&s;ti|mony would be required of her on the trial. After above an hour's conver&s;ation with La Motte, &s;he returned to the lodgings of Madame, where, languid and ill, &s;he withdrew to her cham|ber, and tried to obliviate her anxieties in &s;leep.</P>
<P>The parliament which conducted the trial re-a&s;&s;embled in a few days after the arrival of Adeline, and the two remaining witne&s;&s;es of the Marquis, on whom he now re&s;ted his cau&s;e again&s;t La Motte, appeared. She was led trembling into the Court, where almo&s;t the fir&s;t object that met her eyes was the Marquis de Montalt, whom &s;he now beheld with an emotion en|tirely new to her, and which was &s;trongly tinctured with horror. When du Bo&s;&s;e &s;aw her, he immediately &s;wore to her identity; his te&s;timony was confirmed by her manner; for on perceiving him &s;he grew pale, and a univer&s;al tremor &s;eized her. Jean d'|Aunoy could no where be found, and La Motte was thus depriv|ed of an evidence which e&s;&s;entially effected his intere&s;t. Ade|line, when called upon, gave her little narrative with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion; and Peter, who had conveyed her from the Ab|bey &s;upported the te&s;timony &s;he offered. The evidence produ|ced was &s;ufficient to criminate the Marquis of the intention of murder, in the minds of mo&s;t people pre&s;ent; but it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="151" REF="029379_0155_0FE069A0AC03AB70">
&s;ufficient to effect the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;timony of his two la&s;t witne&s;&s;es, who po&s;itively &s;wore to the commi&s;&s;ion of the robbery, and to the per&s;on of La Motte, on whom &s;entence of death was according|ly pronounced. On receiving this &s;entence the unhappy crimi|nal fainted, and the compa&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e feelings had been unu&s;ually intere&s;ted in the deci&s;ion, was expre&s;&s;ed in a general groan.</P>
<P>Their attention was quickly called to a new object&mdash;it was Jean d'Aunoy who now entered the court. But his evidence, if it could ever, indeed, have been the means of &s;aving La Mot|te, came too late. He was reconducted to pri&s;on; but Ade|line, who, extremely &s;hocked by his &s;entence, was much indi&s;|po&s;ed, received orders to remain in the Court during the exami|nation of d'Aunoy. This man had been at length found in the pri&s;on of a provincial town, where &s;ome of his creditors had thrown him, and from which even the money which the Marquis had remitted to him for the purpo&s;e of &s;atisfying the craving importunities of du Bo&s;&s;e, had been in&s;ufficient to relea&s;e him. Meanwhile the revenge of the latter had been rou&s;ed again&s;t the Marquis by an imaginary neglect, and the money which was de&s;igned to relieve his nece&s;&s;ities was &s;pent by de'Aunoy in rio|tous luxury.</P>
<P>He was confronted with Adeline and with du Bo&s;&s;e, and or|dered to confe&s;s all he knew concerning this my&s;terious affair, or to undergo the torture. D'Aunoy, who was ignorant how far the &s;u&s;picions concerning the Marquis extended, and who was con&s;cious that his own words might condemn him, remained for &s;ometime ob&s;tinately &s;ilent; but when the <HI>que&s;tion</HI> was ad|mini&s;tered his re&s;olution gave way, and he confe&s;&s;ed a crime of which he had not even been &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>It appeared, that in the year 1642 d'Aunoy together with one Jacques Martigny, and Francis Balliere, had way-laid and &s;eized, Henry Marquis de Montalt, half-brother to Phillipe; and after having robbed him, and bound his &s;ervant to a tree, according to the orders they bad received, they conveyed him to the Abbey of St. Clair, in the di&s;tant fore&s;t of Fontangville. Here he was confined for &s;ometime till farther directions were received from Phillipe de Montalt, the pre&s;ent Marquis who was then on his e&s;tates in a northern province of France. The&s;e orders were for death, and the unfortunate Henry was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> chamber in the third week of his confinement at the Abbey.</P>
<P>On hearing this Adeline grew faint; &s;he remembered the M S. &s;he had found, together with the extraordinary circum|&s;tances
<PB N="152" REF="029379_0156_0FE08EB38557DBE0">
that had attended to the di&s;covery; every nerve thrilled with horror, and rai&s;ing her eyes &s;he &s;aw the countenance of the Marquis over&s;pread with the livid palene&s;s of guilt. She endea|voured, however, to arre&s;t her fleeting &s;pirits while the man pro|ceeded in his confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the murder was perpetrated, d'Aunoy had returned to his employer who gave him the reward agreed upon, and in a few months after delivered into his hands the infant daughter of the late Marquis, whom he conveyed to a di&s;tant part of the kingdom, where a&s;&s;uming the name of St. Pierre, he brought her up as his own child, receiving from the pre&s;ent Marquis a con&s;iderable annuity for his &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>Adeline, no longer able to &s;truggle with the tumult of emo|tions that now ru&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed upon her heart, uttered a deep &s;igh and fainted away. She was carried from the Court, and, when the confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by this circum&s;tance &s;ub&s;ided, Jean d'Aunoy went on. He related, that on the death of his wife, Adeline was placed in a convent, from whence &s;he was afterwards remov|ed to another, where, the Marquis had de&s;tined her to receive the vows. That her determined rejection of them had occa&s;ioned him to re&s;olve upon her death, and that &s;he had accordingly been removed to the hou&s;e on the heath. D'Aunoy added, that by the Marquis's order he had mi&s;lead du Bo&s;&s;e with a fal&s;e &s;to|ry of her birth. Having after &s;ometime di&s;covered that his comrades had deceived him concerning her death, d'Aunoy &s;e|parated from them in enmity; but they unanimou&s;ly determin|ed to conceal her e&s;cape from the Marquis, that they might en|joy the recompen&s;e of their &s;uppo&s;ed crime. Some months &s;ub&s;equent to this period, however, d'Aunoy received a letter from the Marquis, charging him with the truth and promi&s;ing him a large reward if he would confe&s;s where he had placed Adeline. In con&s;equence of this letter he acknowledged that &s;he had been given into the hands of a &s;tranger: but who he was, or where he lived, was not known.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e depo&s;itions Phillipe de Montalt was committed to take his trial for the murder of Henry, his brother; d'Au|noy was thrown into a dungeon of the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elet, and du Bo&s;&s;e was bound to appear as evidence.</P>
<P>The feelings of the Marquis, who, in a pro&s;ecution &s;timulated by revenge, had thus unexpectedly expo&s;ed his crimes to the public eye, and betrayed him&s;elf to ju&s;tice, can only be imagin|ed. The pa&s;&s;ions which had tempted him to the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime &s;o horrid as that of murder&mdash;and what, if po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="153" REF="029379_0156_0FE08EB38557DBE0">
heightened its atrocity, the murder of one connected with him by the ties of blood, and by the habits of even infantine a&s;&s;oci|ation&mdash;the pa&s;&s;ions which had &s;timulated him to &s;o mon&s;trous a deed were ambition and the love of plea&s;ure. The fir&s;t was more immediately gratified by the title of his brother; the latter by the riches which would enable him to indulge his voluptuous inclinations.</P>
<P>The late Marquis de Montalt, the father of Adeline, received from his Ance&s;tors a patrimony very inadequate to &s;upport the &s;plendor of his rank; but he had married the heire&s;s of an illu&s;|trious family, who&s;e fortune amply &s;upplied the deficiency of his own. He had the misfortune to lo&s;e her, for &s;he was amiable and beautiful, &s;oon after the birth of a daughter, and it was then, that the pre&s;ent Marquis formed the diabolical de&s;ign of de&s;troying his brother. The contra&s;t of their characters pre|vented that cordial regard between them which their near re|lation&s;hip &s;eemed to demand. Henry was benevolent, mild, and contemplative. In his heart reigned the love of virtue; in his manners the &s;trictne&s;s of ju&s;tne&s;s was tempered, not weakened, by mercy; his mind was enlarged by &s;cience, and adorned by elegant literature. The character of Phillipe has been already delineated in his actions; its nicer &s;hades were blendid with &s;ome &s;hining tints; but the&s;e &s;erved only to render more &s;triking by contra&s;t the general darkne&s;s of the portrait.</P>
<P>He had married a lady, who, by the death of her brother, inherited con&s;iderable e&s;tates, of which the Abbey of St. Clair, and the villa on the borders of the fore&s;t of Fontangville, were the chief. His pa&s;&s;ion for mignificence and di&s;&s;ipation, howev|er, &s;oon involved him in difficulties, and pointed out to him the conveniency of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his brother's wealth. His brother and his infant daughter only &s;tood between him and his wi&s;hes; how he removed the father has been already related; why he did not employ the &s;ame means to &s;ecure the child, &s;eems &s;ome|what &s;urpri&s;ing, unle&s;s we admit that a de&s;tiny hung over him on this occa&s;ion, and that &s;he was &s;uffered to live as an in&s;tru|ment to puni&s;h the murderer of her parent. When a retro&s;pect is taken of the vici&s;&s;itudes and dangers to which &s;he had been expo&s;ed from her earlie&s;t infancy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> appears as if her pre&s;erva|tion was the effect of &s;omething more than human policy, and affords a &s;triking in&s;tance that <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> however long delayed, will overtake the guilty.</P>
<P>While the late unhappy Marquis was &s;uffering at the Abbey, his brother, who, to avoid &s;u&s;picion, remained in the north of
<PB N="154" REF="029379_0157_0FE08EB854BBB570">
France, delayed the execution of his horrid purpo&s;e from a tim|idity natural to a mind not yet inured to enormous guilt. Be|fore he dared to deliver his final orders he waited to know whe|ther the &s;tory he contrived to propagate of his brother's death would veil his crime from &s;u&s;picion. It &s;ucceeded but too well; for the &s;ervent who&s;e life had been &s;pared, that he might relate the tale, naturally enough concluded that his Lord had been mur|dered by Banditti; and the pea&s;ant, who a few hours after found the &s;ervant, bleeding, and bound to a tree, and knew al&s;o that this &s;pot was infe&s;ted by robbers, as naturally believed him, and &s;pread the report accordingly.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this period the Marquis, to whom the Abbey of Saint Clair belonged in right of his wife, vi&s;ited it only twice, and that at di&s;tant times, till after an interval of &s;everal years he ac|cidentally found La Motte its inhabitant. He re&s;ided at Paris, and on his e&s;tate in the north, except that once a year, he u&s;ual|ly pa&s;&s;ed a month at his delightful villa on the borders of the fore&s;t. In the bu&s;y &s;cenes of the Court, and in the di&s;&s;ipations of plea&s;ure, he tried to lo&s;e the remembrance of his guilt; but there were times when the voice of con&s;cience would be heard, though it was &s;oon again lo&s;t in the tumult of the world.</P>
<P>It was probable, that on the night of his abrupt departure from the Abbey, the &s;olitary &s;ilence and gloom of the hour, in a place which had been the &s;cene of his former crime, called up the remembrance of his brother with a force too powerful for fancy, and awakened horrors which compelled him to quit the polluted &s;pot. If it was &s;o, it is however certain that the &s;pectres of con&s;cience vani&s;hed with the darkne&s;s; for on the following day he returned to the Abbey, though it may be ob&s;erved, he never attempted to pa&s;s another night there. But though terror was rou&s;ed for a tran&s;ient moment, neither pity or repentance &s;ucceeded, &s;ince when the di&s;covery of Adeline's birth excited apprehen&s;ion for his own life, he did not he&s;itate to repeat the crime, and would again have &s;tained his &s;oul with human blood. This di&s;covery was effected by means of a &s;eal, bearing the arms of her mother's family, which was impre&s;&s;ed on the note his &s;er|vant had found, and had delivered to him at Caux. It may be remembered, that having read this note, he was throwing it from him in the fury of jealou&s;y; but that after examining it again, it was carefully depo&s;ited in his pocket book. The violent agita|tion which a &s;u&s;picion of this terrible truth occa&s;ioned, deprived him for a while of all power to act. When he was well enough to write he di&s;patched a letter to d'Aunoy, the purport of which
<PB N="155" REF="029379_0157_0FE08EB854BBB570">
has been already mentioned. From d'Aunoy he received the confirmation of his fears. Knowing that his life mu&s;t pay the forfeiture of his crime, &s;hould Adeline ever obtain a know|ledge of her birth, and not daring again to confide in the &s;ecrecy of a man who had once deceived him, he re&s;olved, after &s;ome deliberation, on her death. He immediately &s;et out for the Ab|bey, and gave tho&s;e directions concerning her which terror for his own &s;afety, &s;till more than a de&s;ire of retaining her e&s;tates &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>As the hi&s;tory of the &s;eal which revealed the birth of Adeline is rather remarkable, it may not be ami&s;s to mention, that it was &s;tolen from the Marquis, together with a gold watch by Jean d'Aunoy: the watch was &s;oon di&s;po&s;ed of, but the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d been kept as a pretty trinket by his wife, and at her death went with Adeline among her clothes to the convent. Adeline had carefully pre&s;erved it, becau&s;e it had once belonged to the wo|man whom &s;he believed to have been her mother.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE now return to the cour&s;e of the narrative, and to Ade|line, who was carried from the court to the lodging of Madame de la Motte. Madame was, however, at the Chatelet with her hu&s;band, &s;uffering all the di&s;tre&s;s which the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t him might be &s;uppo&s;ed to inflect. The feeble frame of Adeline, &s;o long harra&s;&s;ed by grief and fatigue, almo&s;t &s;unk un|der the agitation which the di&s;covery of her birth excited. Her feelings on this occa&s;ion were too complex to be analy&s;ed. From an orphan &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on the bounty of others, without family, with few friends, and pur&s;ued by a cruel and powerful enemy, &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf &s;uddenly transformed to the daughter of an illu&s;|trious hou&s;e, and the heire&s;s of immen&s;e wealth. But &s;he learned al&s;o that her father had been murdered&mdash;murdered in the prime of his days&mdash;murdered by means of his brother, again&s;t whom &s;he mu&s;t now appear, and in puni&s;hing the de&s;troyer of her pa|rent doom her uncle to death.</P>
<P>When &s;he remembered the manu&s;cript &s;o &s;ingularly found, and con&s;idering that when &s;he wept for the &s;ufferings it de&s;cribed, her tears had flowed for tho&s;e of her father, her emotion cannot
<PB N="156" REF="029379_0158_0FE08EC6E0514508">
ea&s;ily be imagined. The circum&s;tances attending the di&s;covery of the&s;e papers no longer appeared to be a work of chance, but of a Power who&s;e de&s;igns are great and ju&s;t. "O my father!" &s;he would exclaim, "your la&s;t wi&s;h is fulfilled&mdash;the pitying heart you wi&s;hed might trace your &s;ufferings &s;hall avenge them."</P>
<P>On the return of Madame La Motte Adeline endeavoured as u&s;ual, to &s;uppre&s;s her own emotions, that &s;he might &s;ooth the affliction of her friend. She related what had pa&s;&s;ed in the courts after the departure of La Motte, and thus excited, even in the &s;orrowful heart of Madame, a momentary gleam of &s;atisfaction. Adeline determined to recover, if po&s;&s;ible, the manu&s;cript. On inquiry &s;he learned that La Motte, in the confu&s;ion of his depar|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad left it among other things at the Abbey. This cir|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her, the more &s;o becau&s;e &s;he believed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts appearance might be of importance on the approaching trial: &s;he determined however, if &s;he &s;hould receive her rights, to have the manu&s;cript &s;ought for.</P>
<P>In the evening Louis joined this mournful party: he came immediately from his father, whom he left more tranquil than he had been &s;ince the fatal &s;entence was pronounced. After a &s;ilent and melancholy &s;upper they &s;eparated for the night, and Adeline, in the &s;olitude of her chamber, had lei&s;ure to meditate on the di&s;coveries of this eventful day. The &s;ufferings of her dead father, &s;uch as &s;he had read them recorded by his <HI>own hand,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t forcibly to her thoughts. The narrative had formerly &s;o much affected her heart, and intere&s;ted her imagi|nation, that her memory now faithfully reflected each particular circum&s;tance there di&s;clo&s;ed. But when &s;he con&s;idered that &s;he had been in the very chamber where her parent had &s;uffered, where even his life had been &s;acrificed, and that &s;he had probably &s;een the very dagger, &s;een it &s;tained with ru&s;t, the ru&s;t of blood! by which he had fallen, the angui&s;h and horror of her mind de|fied all controul.</P>
<P>On the following day Adeline received orders to prepare for the pro&s;ecution of the Marquis de Montalt, which was to com|mence as &s;oon as the requi&s;ite witne&s;&s;es could be collected. Among the&s;e were the Abbe&s;s of the convent, who had received her from the hands of d'Aunoy; Madame La Motte, who was pre&s;ent when Du Bo&s;&s;e compelled her hu&s;band to receive Adeline; and Peter, who had not only been witne&s;s to this circum&s;tance, but who had conveyed her from the Abbey that &s;he might e&s;cape the de&s;igns of the Marquis. La Motte, and Theodore La Luc were in|capacitated by the &s;entence of the law from appearing on the trial.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="029379_0158_0FE08EC6E0514508">When La Motte was informed of the di&s;covery of Adeline's birth, and that her father had been murdered at the Abbey of St. Clair, he in&s;tantly remembered, and mentioned to his wife, the &s;keleton he found in the &s;tone room leading to the &s;ubterranean cells. Neither of them doubted, from the &s;ituation in which it lay, hid in a che&s;t in an ob&s;cure room &s;trongly guarded, that La Motte had &s;een the remains of the late Marquis. Madame, how|ever, determined not to &s;hock Adeline with the mention of this circum&s;tance till it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to declare it on the trial.</P>
<P>As the time of the trial drew near, the di&s;tre&s;s and agitation of Adeline increa&s;ed. Though ju&s;tice demanded the life of the murderer, and though the tenderne&s;s and pity which the idea of a father called forth, urged her to avenge his death, &s;he could not without horror, con&s;ider her&s;elf as the in&s;trument of di&s;pen&s;ing that ju&s;tice which would deprive a fellow-being of exi&s;tence; and there were times when &s;he wi&s;hed the &s;ecret of her birth had never been revealed. If this &s;en&s;ibility was, in her peculiar cir|cum&s;tances, a weakne&s;s it was at lea&s;t an amiable one, and as &s;uch de&s;erves to be reverenced.</P>
<P>The accounts &s;he received from Vaceau of the health of M. La Luc did not contribute to tranquillize her mind. The &s;ymp|toms de&s;cribed by Clara &s;eemed to &s;ay that he was in the la&s;t &s;tage of a con&s;umption, and the grief of Theodore and her&s;elf on this occa&s;ion was expre&s;&s;ed in her letters with the lively eloquence &s;o natural to her. Adeline loved and revered La Luc for his own worth and for the parental tenderne&s;s he had &s;hewed her, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was &s;till dearer to her as the father of Theodor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and her concern for his declining &s;tate was not inferior to that of his children&punc; It was increa&s;ed by the reflection that &s;he had proba|bly been the means of &s;hortening his life, for &s;he too well knew the di&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ioned him by the &s;ituation in which it had been her misfortune to involve Theodore, had &s;hattered his frame to its pre&s;ent infirmity. The &s;ame cau&s;e al&s;o withheld him from &s;eeking in the climate of Montpellier the relief he had formerly been taught to expect there. When &s;he looked round on the condition of her friends, her heart was almo&s;t overwhelmed with the pro&s;pect; it &s;eemed as if &s;he was de&s;tined to involv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to her in calamity. With re&s;pect to La Motte, whatever were his vices, and whatever the de&s;igns in which he had formerly engaged again&s;t her, &s;he forgot them all in the &s;ervice he had finally rendered her, and con&s;idered it to be as much her duty, as &s;he felt it to be her inclination, to intercede in his behalf. This, however, in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation &s;he could not do with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s; but if the &s;uit, upon which
<PB N="158" REF="029379_0159_0FE08ECB72C07650">
depended the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her rank, her fortune, and con&s;e|quently her influence, &s;hould be decided in her favour, &s;he de|termined to throw her&s;elf at the king's feet, and when &s;he plead|ed the cau&s;e of Theodore, a&s;k the life of La Motte.</P>
<P>A few days preceding that of the trial, Adeline was informed a &s;tranger de&s;ired to &s;peak with her, and on going to the room where he was, &s;he found M. Verneuil. Her countenance ex|pre&s;&s;ed both &s;urpri&s;e and &s;atisfaction at this unexpected meeting, and &s;he inquired, though with little expectation of an affirma|tive, if he had heard of M. La Luc. "I have &s;een him" &s;aid M. Verneuil; "I am ju&s;t come from Vaceau. But I am &s;orry I can|not give you a better account of his health. He is greatly al|tered &s;ince I &s;aw him before."</P>
<P>Adeline could &s;carcely refrain from tears at the recollection the&s;e words revived of the calamities which had occa&s;ioned this lamented change. M. Verneuil delivered her a packet from Clara; as he pre&s;ented it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;aid, "Be&s;ide this introduction to your notice, I have a claim of a different kind, which I am proud to a&s;&s;ert, and which will perhaps ju&s;tify the permi&s;&s;ion I a&s;k of &s;peaking upon your affairs." Adeline bowed, and M. Verneuil, with a countenance expre&s;&s;ive of the mo&s;t tender &s;olicitude, ad|ded that he had heard of the late proceeding of the parliament of Paris, and of the di&s;coveries that &s;o intimately concerned her. "I know not," continued he, "whether I ought to congratulate or condole with you on this trying occa&s;ion. That I &s;incerely &s;ympathize in all that concerns you I hope you will believe, and I cannot deny my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of telling you that I am related though di&s;tantly to the late Marchione&s;s, your mother, for that &s;he <HI>was your mother</HI> I cannot doubt."</P>
<P>Adeline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e ha&s;tily and advanced towards M. Verneuil; &s;ur|pri&s;e and &s;atisfaction reanimated her features. "Do I indeed &s;ee a relation?" &s;aid &s;he in a &s;weet and tremulous voice, "and one whom I can welcome as a friend?" Tears trembled in her eyes; and &s;he received M. Verneuil's embrace in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; It was &s;ometime before her emotion would permit her to &s;peak.</P>
<P>To Adeline, who from her earlie&s;t infancy had been abandoned to &s;trangers, a forlorn and helple&s;s orphan&punc; who had never till lately known a relation, and who then found one in the per&s;on of an inveterate enemy, to her this di&s;covery was as delightful as unexpected. But after &s;truggling for &s;ometime with the various emotions that pre&s;&s;ed upon her heart, &s;he begged M. Verneuil permi&s;&s;ion to withdraw till &s;he could recover compo&s;ure. He would have taken leave, but &s;he entreated him not to go.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t which M. Verneuil took in the concerns of La Luc, which was &s;trengthened by his increa&s;ing regard for Clara, had
<PB N="159" REF="029379_0159_0FE08ECB72C07650">
drawn him to Vaceau, where he was informed of the family and peculiar circum&s;tances of Adeline. On receiving this intelli|gence he immediately &s;et out for Paris to offer his protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his newly di&s;covered relation, and to aid, if po&s;&s;ible, the cau&s;e of Theodore.</P>
<P>Adeline in a &s;hort time returned, and could then bear to con|ver&s;e on the &s;ubject of her family. M. Verneuil offered her his &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if they &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary. "But I tru&s;t," added he, to the ju&s;tne&s;s of your cau&s;e, and hope it will not require any adventitious aid. To tho&s;e who remember the late Marchione&s;s, your features brings &s;ufficient evidence of your birth. As a proof that my judgment in this in&s;tance is not bi|a&s;&s;ed by prejudice, the re&s;emblance &s;truck me when I was in Sa|voy, though I knew the Marchione&s;s only by her portrait; and I believe I mentioned to M. La Luc that you often reminded me of a decea&s;ed relation. You may form &s;ome judgment of this your&s;elf, added M. Verneuil, taking a miniature from his poc|ket. "This was your amiable mother."</P>
<P>Adeline's countenance changed; &s;he received the picture eagerly, gazed on it for a long time in &s;ilence, and her eyes fill|ed with tears. It was not the re&s;emblance &s;he &s;tudied but the countenance&mdash;the mild and beautiful countenance of her parent, who&s;e blue eyes full of tender &s;weetne&s;s, &s;eemed bent upon her's; while a &s;oft &s;mile played on her lips; Adeline pre&s;&s;ed the pic|ture to her's, and again gazed in &s;ilent reverie. At length, with a deep &s;igh, &s;he &s;aid, "This &s;urely <HI>was</HI> my mother. Had &s;he <HI>but</HI> lived, O my poor father! you had been &s;pared." This re|flection quite overcame her, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears. M. Verneuil did not interrupt her grief, but took her hand and &s;at by her without &s;peaking till &s;he became more compo&s;ed. Again ki&s;&s;ing the picture, &s;he held it out to him with a he&s;itating look. "No," &s;aid he, "it is already with its true owner." She thanked him with a &s;mile of ineffable &s;weetne&s;s, and after &s;ome conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of the approaching trial, on which occa&s;ion &s;he re|que&s;ted M. Verneuil would &s;upport her by his pre&s;ence, he with|drew, having begged leave to repeat his vi&s;it on the following day.</P>
<P>Adeline now opened her packet, and &s;aw once more the well-known characters of Theodore; for a moment &s;he felt as if in his pre&s;ence, and the con&s;cious blu&s;h o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r&s;pread her cheek; with a trembling hand &s;he broke the &s;eal, and read the tendere&s;t a&s;&s;ur|ances and &s;olicitudes of his love; &s;he often pau&s;ed that &s;he might prolong the &s;weet emotions which the&s;e a&s;&s;uranc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> awakened, but while tears of tenderne&s;s &s;tood trembling on her eyelids, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itter recollection of his &s;ituation would return, and they fell in angui&s;h on her bo&s;om.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="029379_0160_0FE08ED990716960">He congratulated her, and with peculiar delicacy, on the pro&s;|pects of life which were opening to her; &s;aid every thing that might tend to animate and &s;upport her, but avoided dwelling on his own circum&s;tances, except by expre&s;&s;ing his &s;en&s;e of the zeal and kindne&s;s of his commanding officer, and adding, that he did not de&s;pair of finally obtaining a pardon.</P>
<P>This hope, though but faintly expre&s;&s;ed, and written evidently for the purpo&s;e of con&s;oleing Adeline, did not entirely fail of the de&s;ired effect. She yielded to its enchanting influence, and for|got for a while the many &s;ubjects of care and anxiety which &s;ur|rounded her. Theodore &s;aid little of his father's health; what he did &s;ay was by no means &s;o di&s;couraging as the accounts of Clara, who, le&s;s anxious to conceal a truth that mu&s;t give pain to Ade|line, expre&s;&s;ed, without re&s;erve, all her apprehen&s;ion and concern.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE day of the trial &s;o anxiou&s;ly awaited, and on which the fate of &s;o many per&s;ons depended, at length arrived. Adeline, accompanied by M. Verneuil and Madame la Motte, appeared as the pro&s;ecutor of the Marquis de Montalt; and d'Aunoy, du Bo&s;&s;e, Louis de la Motte, and &s;everal other per&s;ons, as witne&s;s in her cau&s;e. The judges were &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in France; and the advocates on both &s;ides men of eminent abili|ties. On a trial of &s;uch importance, the court, as may be imag|ined, crowded with per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and the &s;pectacle it pre&s;ented was &s;trikingly &s;olemn, yet magnificent.</P>
<P>When &s;he appeared before the tribunal, Adeline's emotion &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed all the arts of di&s;gui&s;e, but adding to the natural dignity of her air an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;oft timidity, and to her downca&s;t eyes a &s;weet confu&s;ion, it rendered her an object &s;till more intere&s;ting; and &s;he attracted the univer&s;al pity and admiration of the a&s;&s;em|bly When &s;he ventured to rai&s;e her eyes, &s;he perceived that the Marquis was not yet in the court, and while &s;he awaited his appear|ance in trembling expectation, a confu&s;ed murmuring aro&s;e in a di&s;tant part of the hall. Her &s;pirits now almo&s;t for&s;ook her; the certainty of &s;eeing immediately, and con&s;ciou&s;ly, the murderer of her father, chilled her with horror, and &s;he was with difficulty pre&s;erved from fainting. A low &s;ound now ran through the
<PB N="161" REF="029379_0160_0FE08ED990716960">
court, and an air of confu&s;ion appeared, which was &s;oon com|municated to the tribunal it&s;elf. Several of the members aro&s;e, &s;ome left the hall, the whole place exhibited a &s;cene of di&s;order, and a report at length reached Adeline that the Marquis de Mon|talt was dying. A con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed in uncertainty; but the confu&s;ion continued; The Marquis did not appear; and at Ade|line's reque&s;t M. V&mdash; went in que&s;t of more po&s;itive information.</P>
<P>He followed a crowd which was hurrying towards the Chate|let, and with &s;ome difficulty gained admittance into the pri&s;on; but the porter at the gate, whom he had bribed for a pa&s;&s;port, could give him no certain information on the &s;ubject of his in|quiry, and not being at liberty to quit his po&s;t, furni&s;hed M. Verneuil with only a vague direction to the Marquis's apartment. The courts were &s;ilent and de&s;erted, but as he advanced a di&s;tant h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m of voices led him on, till perceiving &s;everal per&s;ons running towards a &s;tairca&s;e which appeared beyond the archway of a long pa&s;&s;age, he followed thither, and learned that the Marquis was certainly dying. The &s;tairca&s;e was filled with people; he en|deavoured to pre&s;s through the crowd, and after much &s;truggle and difficulty he reached the door of an anti-room which com|municated with the apartment where the Marquis lay, and whence &s;everal per&s;ons now i&s;&s;ued. Here he learned that the object of his inquiry was already dead. M. Verneuil, however, pre&s;&s;ed through the anti-room to the chamber where lay the Marquis on a bed &s;urrounded by officers of the law, and two notaries, who appeared to have been taking down depo&s;itions. His countenance was &s;uffu&s;ed with a black, and deadly hue, and impre&s;&s;ed with the horrors of death; M. Verneuil turned away, &s;hocked by the &s;pec|tacle, and on inquiry heard that the Marquis had died by poi&s;on.</P>
<P>It appeared that convinced he had nothing to hope from his trial, he had taken this method of avoiding an ignominious death. In the la&s;t hours of life, while tortured with the re|membrance of his crime, he re&s;olved to make all the atonement that remained for him, and having &s;wallowed the potion, he immediately &s;ent for a confe&s;&s;or, to take a full confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt, and two notaries, and thus e&s;tabli&s;hed Adeline beyond di&s;pute in the rights of her birth; and al&s;o bequeathed her a con&s;iderable legacy.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e depo&s;itions &s;he was &s;oon after formal|ly acknowledged as the daughter and heire&s;s of Henry Marquis de Montalt, and the rich e&s;tates of her father were re&s;tored to her. She immediately threw her&s;elf at the feet of the king in behalf of Theodore and of La Motte. The character of the former, the cau&s;e in which he had ri&s;ked his life, and the occa|&s;ion
<PB N="162" REF="029379_0161_0FE08EDE25B26018">
of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e late Marquis's enmity towards him, were circum&s;tan|ces &s;o notorious, and &s;o forcible, that it is more than probable the monarch would have granted his pardon to a plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er le&s;s irr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i&s;tible than was Adeline de Montalt. Theodore La Luc not only received an ample pardon, but in con&s;ideration of his gallant conduct towards Adeline, he was &s;oon after rai&s;ed to a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of con&s;iderable rank in the army.</P>
<P>For La Motte who had been condemned for the robbery on full evidence, and who had been al&s;o charged with the crime which had formerly compelled him to quit Paris, a pardon could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be obtained, but at the earne&s;t &s;upplication of Adeline, and in con&s;ideration of the &s;ervice he had finally rendered her, his &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence was &s;oftened from death to bani&s;hment. This indul|gence, however, would have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed him little, had not the no|ble genero&s;ity of Adeline &s;ile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed other pro&s;ecutions that were preparing again&s;t him, and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">owed on him a &s;um more than &s;ufficient to &s;upport his family in a foreign country. This kind|ne&s;s operated &s;o powerfully upon his heart, which had been be|trayed through weakne&s;s rather than natural depravity, and awakened &s;o keen a remor&s;e for the injuries he had once medi|tated again&s;t a benefactre&s;s &s;o noble, that his former habits be|came odious to him, and his character gradually recovered the hue which it would probably always have worn had he never been expo&s;ed to the tempting di&s;&s;ipations of Paris.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion which Louis had &s;o long owned for Adeline was rai&s;ed almo&s;t to adoration by her late conduct; but he now re|linqui&s;hed even the faint hope which he had hitherto almo&s;t un|con&s;ciou&s;ly cheri&s;hed, and, &s;ince the life which was granted to Theodore rendered this &s;acrifice nece&s;&s;ary, he could not repine. He re&s;olved, however, to &s;eek in ab&s;ence the tranquillity he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d lo&s;t, and to place his future happine&s;s on that of two per&s;ons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o de&s;ervedly dear to him.</P>
<P>On the eve of his departure La Motte and his family took a very affecting leave of Adeline; he left Paris for England, where it was his de&s;ign to &s;ettle; and Louis, who was eager to fly from her enchantments, &s;et out on the &s;ame day for his regiment.</P>
<P>Adeline remained &s;ometime at Paris to &s;ettle her affairs, where &s;he was introduced by M. V&mdash; to the few and di&s;tant relations that remained of her family. Among the&s;e were the Count and Counte&s;s D&mdash;, and the Mon. Amand, who had &s;o much engaged her pity and e&s;teem at Nice. The lady, who&s;e death he lamented, was of the family of de Montalt; and the re&s;emblance which he had traced between her features and tho&s;e of Adeline, her cou&s;in, was &s;omething more than the effect of fancy. The death of his elder brother had abruptly recalled him
<PB N="163" REF="029379_0161_0FE08EDE25B26018">
from Italy; but Adeline had the &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve that the heavy melancholy which formerly oppre&s;&s;ed him, had yielded to a &s;ort of placid re&s;ignation, and that his countenance was of|ten enlivened by a tran&s;ient gleam of cheerfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Count and Counte&s;s D&mdash;, who were much intere&s;ted by her goodne&s;s and beauty, invited her to make their hotel her re&s;idence while &s;he remained at Paris.</P>
<P>Her fir&s;t care was to have the remains of her parent removed from the Abbey of St. Clair, and depo&s;ited in the vault of his ance&s;tors. D'Aunoy, was tried condemned and hanged for the murder. At the place of execution he had de&s;cribed the &s;pot where the remains of the Marquis were concealed, which was in the &s;tone room already mentioned, belonging to the Abbey. M. V&mdash; accompanied the officers appointed for the &s;earch, and attended the a&s;hes of the Marquis to St. Maur, an e&s;tate in one of the northern provinces. There they were depo&s;ited with the &s;olemn funeral pomp becoming his rank. Adeline attended as chief mourner; and this la&s;t duty paid to the memory of her parent, &s;he became more tranquil and re&s;igned. The M S. that recorded his &s;ufferings had been found at the Abbey, and de|livered to her by M. Verneuil and &s;he pre&s;erved it with the pi|ous enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;o &s;acred a relique de&s;erved.</P>
<P>On her return to Paris, Theodore La Luc, who was come from Montpellier, awaited her arrival. The happine&s;s of this meeting was clouded by the account he brought of his father, who&s;e extreme danger had alone withheld him from ha&s;tening the moment he obtained his liberty, to thank Adeline for the life &s;he had pre&s;erved. She now received him as the friend to whom &s;he was indebted for her pre&s;ervation, and as the lover who de&s;erved, and po&s;&s;e&s;t her tendere&s;t affection. The remembrance of the circum&s;tances under which they had la&s;t met, and of their mutual angui&s;h, rendered more exqui&s;ite the happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent moments, when no longer oppre&s;&s;ed by the horrid pro&s;|pect of ignominious death and final &s;eparation, they looked forward only to the &s;miling days that awaited them when hand in hand they &s;hould tread the flowery &s;cenes of life. The con|tra&s;t which memory drew of the pa&s;t with the pre&s;ent, frequent|ly drew tears of tenderne&s;s and gratitude to their eyes, and the &s;weet &s;mile which &s;eemed &s;truggling to di&s;pel from the counte|nance of Adeline tho&s;e gems of &s;orrow, penetrated the heart of Theodore, and brought to his recollection a little &s;ong which in other circum&s;tances he had formerly &s;ung to her. He took up a lute that lay on the table, and touching the dulcet chords, ac|companied it with the following words:

<P>Her affection for Theodore had induced Adeline to reject &s;everal &s;uitors which her goodne&s;s, beauty and wealth, had already attracted, and whom though infinitely his &s;uperiors in point of fortune, were many of them inferior to him in family, and all of them in merit.</P>
<P>The various and tumultuous emotions which the late events had called forth in the bo&s;om of Adeline were now &s;ub&s;ided; but the memory of her father &s;till tinctured her mind with a melancholy that time only could &s;ubdue; and &s;he refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to the &s;upplications of Theodore till the period &s;he had pre&s;cribed for her mourning &s;hould be expired. The nece&s;&s;ity of rejoining his regiment obliged him to leave Paris within the fortnight after his arrival; but he carried with him a&s;&s;urance of receiving her hand &s;oon after &s;he &s;hould lay a&s;ide her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">able habit, and departed therefore with tolerable compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>M. La Luc's very precarious &s;tate was a &s;ource of ince&s;&s;ant di&s;qui|etude to Adeline, and &s;he determined to accompany M. V&mdash;, who was now the declared lover of Clara, to Montpellier, whither La Luc had immediately gone on the liberation of his &s;on. For this journey &s;he was preparing when &s;he received from her friend a flatter|ing account of his amendment; and as &s;ome farther &s;ettlement of her affairs required her pre&s;ence at Paris, &s;he deferred her de&s;ign, and M. V&mdash; departed alone.</P>
<P>When Theodore's affairs a&s;&s;umed a more favourable a&s;pect, M. Verneuil had written to La Luc, and communicated to him the &s;ecret of his heart re&s;pecting Clara. La Luc who admired and e&s;teemed M. V&mdash;, and who was not ignorant of his family connections, was plea&s;ed with the propo&s;ed alliance; Clara thought &s;he had never &s;een any per&s;on whom &s;he was &s;o much inclined to love; and M. V&mdash; received an an&s;wer favourable to his wi&s;hes, and which encouraged him to undertake the pre&s;ent journey to Montpellier.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of his happine&s;s and the climate of Montpellier did all for the health of La Luc that his mo&s;t anxious friends could wi&s;h, and he was at length &s;o far recovered as to vi&s;it Adeline at her e&s;tate of St. Maur. Clara and M. V&mdash; accompanied him, and a ce&s;|&s;ation of ho&s;tilities between France and Spain &s;oon after permitted Theodore to join this happy party. When La Luc thus re&s;tored to tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to him, looked back on the mi&s;eries he had e&s;caped, and forward to the ble&s;&s;ings that awaited him&punc; his heart dilated with emotions of exqui&s;ite joy and gratitude; and his venerable counte|nance, &s;oftened by an expre&s;&s;ion of complacent delight, exhibited a perfect picture of happy age.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ADELINE, in the &s;ociety of friends &s;o beloved, lo&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion of that melancholy which the fate of her parent had occa&s;ioned; &s;he recovered all her natural vivacity; and when &s;he threw off the mourn|ing habit which filial piety had required her to a&s;&s;ume, &s;he gave her hand to Theodore. The nuptials, which were celebrated at St. Maur, were graced by the pre&s;ence of the Count and Counte&s;s D&mdash;, and La Luc had the &s;upreme felicity of confirming on the &s;ame day the flattering de&s;tines of both his children. When the ceremony was ever he ble&s;&s;ed and embraced them all with tears of fatherly affection. "I thank thee O God! that I have been permitted to &s;ee this hour;" &s;aid he, "whenever it &s;hall plea&s;e thee to call me hence, I &s;hall depart in peace."</P>
<P>"Long, very long, may you be &s;pared to ble&s;s your children," re|plied Adeline. Clara ki&s;&s;ed her father's hand and wept: "Long, very long," &s;he repeated in a voice &s;carcely audible. La Luc &s;mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed cheerfully, and turned the conver&s;ation to a &s;ubject l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s affecting.</P>
<P>But the time now drew nigh when La Luc thought it nece&s;&s;ary to return to the duties of his pari&s;h, from which he had &s;o long been ab|&s;ent. Madame La Luc too, who had attended him during the period of his danger at Montpellier, and hence returned to Savoy, complained much of the &s;olitude of her life; and this was with her brother an ad|ditional motive for his &s;peedy departure. Theodore and Adeline, who could not &s;upport the thought of a &s;eparation, endeavoured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o per&s;uade him to give up his chateau, and to re&s;ide with them in France; but he was held by many ties to Leloncourt. For many years he had con&s;ti|tuted the comfort and happine&s;s of his pari&s;hioners; they revered and loved him as a father; he regarded them with an affection little &s;hort of parental. The attachment they di&s;covered towards him on his depar|ture was not forgotten either; it had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e could not bear the thought of for&s;aking them now that Heaven had &s;howered on him its abundance. "It is &s;weet to live for them," &s;aid he, "and I will al&s;o die among&s;t them." A &s;entiment al&s;o of a more tender nature: (and let not the Stoic prophane it with the name of weakne&s;s, or the man of the world &s;corn it as unnatural) a &s;entiment &s;till more tender attracted him to Leloncourt: the remains of his wife repo&s;ed there.</P>
<P>Since La Luc would not re&s;ide in France, Theodore and Adeline, to whom the &s;plendid gaieties that courted them at Paris were very in|ferior temptations to the &s;weet dome&s;tic plea&s;ures and refined &s;ociety which Leloncourt would afford, determined to accompany La Luc and Mon. and Madame Verneuil abroad. Adeline arranged her affairs
<PB N="166" REF="029379_0163_0FE08EF09A57D5E0">
&s;o as to render her re&s;idence in France unnece&s;&s;ary; and having bade an affectionate adieu to the Count and Counte&s;s D&mdash;, and to M. Amand, who had recovered a tolerable degree of cheerfulne&s;s, &s;he de|parted with her friends for Savoy.</P>
<P>They travelled lei&s;urely, and frequently turned out of their way to view whatever was worthy of ob&s;ervation. After a long and plea&s;ant journey they came once more within view of the Swi&s;s mountains&punc; the &s;ight of which revived a thou&s;and intere&s;ting recollections in the mind of Adeline. She remembered the circum&s;tances and &s;en&s;ations under which &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een them; when an orphan, flying from per&s;ecu|tion to &s;eek &s;helter among &s;trangers, and lo&s;t to the only per&s;on on earth whom &s;he loved: &s;he remembered this, and the contra&s;t of the pre&s;ent moment &s;truck with all its force upon her heart.</P>
<P>The countenance of Clara brightened into &s;miles, of the mo&s;t ani|mated delight as &s;he drew near the beloved &s;cenes of her infant plea|&s;ures; and Theodore often looked from the windows, caught with patriotic enthu&s;ia&s;m the magnificent and changing &s;cenery which the receding mountains &s;ucce&s;&s;ively di&s;clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was evening when they approached within a few miles of Le|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncourt, and the road winding round the foot of a &s;tupendous cragg, pre&s;ented them a full view of the lake, and of the peaceful dwell|ing of La Luc. An exclamation of joy from the whole party announced the di&s;covery, and the glance of plea&s;ure was reflected from every eye. The &s;un's la&s;t light gleamed upon the waters that repo&s;ed in "chry&s;tal purity" below, mellowed every feature of the land&s;cape, and touched with purple &s;plendour the clouds that rolled along the mountain tops.</P>
<P>La Luc welcomed his family to his happy home, and &s;ent up a &s;ilent thank&s;giving that he was permitted thus to return to it. Adeline con|tinued to gaze upon each well-known object, and again reflecting on the vici&s;&s;itudes of grief and joy, and the &s;urpri&s;ing change of fortune which &s;he had experienced &s;ince la&s;t &s;he &s;aw them, her heart dilated with gratitude and complacent delight. She looked at Theodore, whom, in the&s;e very &s;cenes &s;he had lamented as lo&s;t to her for ever; who when found again, was about to be torn from her by an ignominious death, but who now &s;at by her &s;ide, her &s;ecure and happy hu&s;band, the pride of his family and her&s;elf; and while the &s;en&s;ibility of her heart flowed in tears from her eyes, a &s;mile of ineffable tenderne&s;s told him all &s;he felt. He gently pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and an&s;wered her with a look of love.</P>
<P>Peter, who now rode up to the carriage with a face full of joy and of importance, interrupted a cour&s;e of &s;entiment which was become al|mo&s;t too intere&s;ting. "Ah! my dear ma&s;ter!" cried he, "welcome home again. Here is the village&punc; God ble&s;s it! It is worth a million &s;uch places as Paris. Thank St. Jacques, we are all come &s;afe back!"</P>
<P>This effu&s;ion of hone&s;t Peter's joy was received and an&s;wered with the kindne&s;s it de&s;erved. As they drew near the lake mu&s;ic &s;ounded over the water, and they pre&s;ently &s;aw a large party of the villagers a&s;|&s;embled on the green &s;pot that &s;loped to the very margin of the waves, and dancing in all their holiday finery. It was in the evening of a fe&s;tival. The elder pea&s;ants &s;at under the &s;hade of the trees that crowned this little eminence, eating milk and fruits, and watching their &s;ons and daughters fri&s;k it away to the &s;prightly notes of the tabor and pipe, which was joined by the &s;ofter tones of a mandolin.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="029379_0163_0FE08EF09A57D5E0">The &s;cene was highly intere&s;ting, and what added to its picture&s;que beauty, was a group of cattle that &s;tood, &s;ome on the brink, &s;ome half in the water and others repo&s;ing on the green bank, while &s;everal plea&s;ant girls, dre&s;&s;ed in the neat &s;implicity of their country, were di&s;|pen&s;ing the milky fea&s;t. Peter now rode on fir&s;t, and a crowd &s;oon collected round him, who learning that their beloved ma&s;ter was at band, went forth to meat and welcome him. Their warm and hone&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ions of joy diffu&s;ed an exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction over the heart of the good La Luc, who met them with the kindne&s;s of a father, and who could &s;carcely forbear &s;hedding tears to this te&s;timony of their attach|ment. When the younger part of the pea&s;ants heard the news of his arrival, the general joy was &s;uch, that, led by the tabor and pipe, they danced before his carriage to the chateau, where they again welcomed him and his family with the enlivening &s;trains of mu&s;ic. At the gate of the chateau they were received by Madame La Luc, and a happier party never met.</P>
<P>As the evening was uncommonly mild and beautiful, &s;upper was &s;pread in the garden. When the repa&s;t was over, Clara, who&s;e heart was all glee, propo&s;ed a dance by moonlight. "It will be delicious," &s;aid &s;he; "the moonbeams are already dancing on the waters. See what a &s;tream of radiance they throw acro&s;s the lake, and how they &s;parkle round that little promontory on the left. The fre&s;hne&s;s of the hour too invites to dancing."</P>
<P>They all agreed to the propo&s;al&mdash;"And let the good people who have &s;o heartily welcomed us home be called in too," &s;aid La Luc: "they &s;hall <HI>all</HI> partake of our happine&s;s. There is devotion in making others happy, and gratitude ought to make us devout. Pe|ter, bring more wine, and &s;et &s;ome tables under the trees." Peter flew, and, while chairs and tables were placing, Clara ran for her fa|vourite lute, the lute which had formerly afforded her &s;uch delight, and which Adeline had often touched with a melancholy expre&s;&s;ion. Clara's light hand now ran over the chords, and drew forth tones of tender &s;weetne&s;s, her voice accompanying the following:

<P>Peter who could not move in a &s;ober &s;tep had already &s;pread re|fre&s;hment under the trees, and in a &s;hort time the lawn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> encircled

with pea&s;antry. The rural pipe and tabor was placed at Clara's re|que&s;t, under the &s;hade of her beloved acacias on the margin of the lake; the merry notes of mu&s;ic &s;ounded, Adeline led off the dance, and the mountains an&s;wered only to the &s;trains of mirth and melody.</P>
<P>The venerable La Luc, as he &s;at among the elder pea&s;ants, &s;urvey|ed the &s;cene; his children and people thus a&s;&s;embled round him in one grand compact of harmony and joy; the frequent tear bedewed his cheek, and he &s;eemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o ta&s;te the fullne&s;s of an external delight.</P>
<P>So much was every heart rou&s;ed to gladne&s;s, that the morning dawn began to peep upon the &s;cene of their fe&s;tivity, when every cottager returned to his home, ble&s;&s;ing the benevolence of La Luc.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome weeks with La Luc, M. Verne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il bought a cha|teau in the village of Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oncourt, and as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was the only one not alrea|dy occupied, Theodore looking out for a re&s;idence in the neighbour|hood&punc; At the di&s;tance of a few leagues, on the beautiful banks of the lake of Geneva, where the waters retire into a &s;mall bay, he purcha|&s;ed a villa. The Chateau was characterized by an air of &s;implicity and ta&s;te, rather than of magnificence, which however was the chief trait in the &s;urrounding &s;cene. The Chateau was almo&s;t encircled with woods, which forming a grand a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hitheatre, &s;wept down to the waters edge, and abounded with wild and romantic walks. Here nature was &s;uffered to &s;port in all her beautiful luxuriance, except where here and there, the hands of art formed the foilage to admit a view of the blue waters of the lake, with the white &s;ail that glided by, or of the di&s;tant mountains. In front of the Chateau the woods opened to a lawn, and the eye was &s;uffered to wander over the lake, who&s;e bo&s;om pre&s;ented an ever-moving picture, while its va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied margin &s;prinkled with villas, woods, and towns, and crowned beyond with the &s;nowy and &s;ublime Alps&punc; ri&s;ing point behind point in awful confu&s;ion, exhi|bited a &s;cenery of almo&s;t unequalled magnificence.</P>
<P>Here comtemning the &s;plendour of fal&s;e happine&s;s, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the pure and rational delights of a love refined into the mo&s;t tender friend&s;hip, &s;urrounded by the friends &s;o dear to them, and vi&s;ited by a &s;elect and enlightened &s;ociety&mdash;here, in the very bo&s;om of felicity, lived Theodore and Adeline La Luc.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of Louis De la Motte yielded at length to the powers of ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and nece&s;&s;ity. He &s;till loved Adeline, but it was with the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d tenderne&s;s of friend&s;hip, and when at the earne&s;t invi|tation of Theodore, he vi&s;ited the villa, he beheld their happine&s;s with a &s;atisfaction unalloyed by any emotions of envy. He afterwards married a lady of &s;ome fortune at Geneva, and re&s;igning his commi&s;|&s;ion in the French &s;ervice, &s;ettled on the borders of the lake, and in|crea&s;ed the &s;ocial delights of Theodore and Adeline.</P>
<P>Their former lives afforded an example of trials well endured&mdash;and their pre&s;ent&punc; of virtues greatly rewarded; and this reward they con|tinued to de&s;erve&mdash;for not to them&s;elves was their happine&s;s contract|ed, but diffu&s;ed to all who came within the &s;phere of their influence. The indigent and unhappy rejoiced in their benevolence, the virtuou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and enlightened in their friend&s;hip, and their children in parents who&s;e example impre&s;&s;ed upon their hearts the precepts offered to their un|der&s;tandings.</P>
