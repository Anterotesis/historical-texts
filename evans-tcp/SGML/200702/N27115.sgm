<HEAD>CHARACTER OF THIS WORK, FROM THE <HI>BRITISH CRITIC.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Though we are not accu&s;tomed to recommend, with much warmth, the reading of Novels, yet our caution ari&s;es chiefly from the fear of their being too much, or too indi&s;criminately peru&s;ed. A few &s;elect books of this kind may be read with advantage, provided that &s;uch reading be not made a daily or &s;erious occupation. With this re&s;triction we recommend very cordially <HI>&s;uch volumes as the&s;e we are con&s;idering. A STORY more intere&s;ting and affecting, or better told than this, has &s;eldom come under our examination.</HI> Au&s;tere as critics are imagined to be, they are not in&s;en&s;ible to the charms of &s;uch a heroine as Ellen Mordaunt. Perhaps the principal incident in her &s;tory, upon which all the re&s;t turns, is not managed as we could wi&s;h; what is commonly called fir&s;t love, that is the fancy of a boy and girl for each other, founded upon &s;eeing, rather than knowing one another, is not indeed what we in&s;i&s;t upon being adhered to. But a fir&s;t attachment like Ellen's, &s;ounded upon &s;olid merit, and long acquaintance, and &s;anctioned by parents on both &s;ides, &s;hould not have been renounced &s;o &s;peedily. At lea&s;t, if duty and honour forbade her union with Henry, there was no ne|ce&s;&s;ity&mdash;But <HI>we will not dimini&s;h the painfully plea&s;ing &s;u&s;pence in which this Novel mu&s;t hold its readers;</HI> we &s;hall only remark, that the title of it appears to us not happily cho&s;en. <HI>The cha|racter of Ellen is actually di&s;tingui&s;hed not &s;o much by</HI> Plain Sen&s;e, <HI>as by highly cultivated judgment, exqui&s;ite feeling, and invincible inte|grity. Parents may not only with &s;afety put the&s;e volumes into the hands of their children, but may even peru&s;e them with advantage them&s;elves.</HI></P>

<P>MARIA VILLARS was born a beauty. Her fir&s;t &s;mile was enchantment, her fir&s;t movement grace: nor had fortune been le&s;s favourable to her than nature&mdash;&s;he and one &s;on were the only offspring born to lord Villars by his fir&s;t wife: On his marriage, 20,000l. the fortune that his wife brought him, had been by marriage &s;ettle|ments allotted to younger children, and there having been no limitation, as to number, the whole &s;um became the property of Maria. Lady Villars died in a few months after the birth of her daughter; and many more had not elap&s;ed before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Villars exchanged the &s;ober garb of affliction, for the gay trappings of a bridegroom.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="036127_0004_10084F0AC4C6A800">On this &s;econd marriage, Maria was placed under the care of a &s;i&s;ter of her father's, a woman, who, to an unbounded love for di&s;&s;ipation, joined &s;o much natural good humour, as made her de&s;irous that all with whom &s;he had to do, &s;hould &s;hare in plea&s;ures, which &s;he thought &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to hap|pine&s;s. Although married, &s;he had no children; &s;he had talked her&s;elf into the belief, that &s;he was mi&s;erable from the want of them: Maria there|fore became her pa&s;&s;ion;&mdash;the mo&s;t unlimited in|dulgence &s;oon taught her to know no rule for action but her own will. Naturally violent, craving, and vain, &s;he &s;oon became tyrannical, &s;elfi&s;h, and overbearing. Nature had be&s;towed upon her a quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, which, had it been properly directed, might have a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in procuring &s;uch u&s;eful knowledge as would in time have formed her judgment, and corrected her temper; but this quickne&s;s being mi&s;taken by her aunt for wit, it became rather a &s;ubject of prai&s;e for it&s;elf, than cultivated as a means by which to acquire things worthy of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the many accompli&s;hments, therefore, that Maria made a parade of acquiring, &s;he knew no one tolerably, mu&s;ic and dancing excepted. She was born with an accurate ear and a &s;weet voice, and &s;he &s;o early felt the advantage to be derived from the cultivation of &s;uch enchanting talents, that &s;he had acquired a very competent knowledge in the &s;cience of mu&s;ic, and, in the little le&s;s dif|ficult one of dancing, &s;he excelled. In her ear|lie&s;t years &s;he had been her aunt's plaything; as time began more to unfold her charms, &s;he be|came her boa&s;t and her exhibition.</P>
<P>Where rank, youth, beauty, talents and fortune, were united, it is not wonderful that the u&s;eful
<PB N="7" REF="036127_0005_10084F0C4E207480">
acquirements of the under&s;tanding were un&s;ought, or that the unobtru&s;ive virtues of the heart were forgotten. In the circle wherein Maria Villars moved, there was but one opinion, "that mi&s;s Villars was perfection." She heard it every hour of the day, &s;he &s;aw it in the deference that was paid to her opinions, and in the eagerne&s;s that was manife&s;ted even to <HI>prevent</HI> her wi&s;hes; &s;he repeated it to her&s;elf continually, and there was certainly no article of her faith to which her mind yielded half &s;o perfect an a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the general admiration that followed her wherever &s;he appeared, there was not wanting, even from her earlie&s;t youth, &s;everal individuals, who, allured by her beauty, or induced by her fortune, &s;eriou&s;ly &s;ought her for a wife; but her aunt was in no ha&s;te to induce her to fix her choice; &s;he thought no rank, however high, or fortune however &s;plendid, above what might be challenged by the merits of her niece: And Ma|ria (who&s;e greate&s;t delight was in multiplying her conque&s;ts, and in the infliction of pain) en|couraged and di&s;dained all her lovers alike.</P>
<P>She was now in her eighteenth year, when one night on her return from a ball, &s;he declared to her aunt in the mo&s;t peremptory terms, that her choice was made, that &s;he was in love with mr. Mordaunt, and that mr. Mordaunt &s;he would marry. The &s;hock of an earthquake could not have been more tremendous to the feelings of mrs. Forte&s;cue, than was this declaration of her niece; She knew mr. Mordaunt for a young man of fa&s;hion and good family, elegant in his per&s;on and in&s;inuating in his manners, but he was with|out rank, and almo&s;t without fortune; as to his under&s;tanding or his moral character, &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d
<PB N="8" REF="036127_0006_10084F0F6613E108">
never heard either of them mentioned, nor would they have made any part of her inquiries: She attempted to remon&s;trate; but &s;he &s;oon &s;ound that &s;he had neither the power that authority be&s;tows, nor the influence that is derived from affection. Maria had taken her re&s;olution, and &s;he &s;crupled not to &s;ay, "that although &s;he &s;hould be be&s;t plea&s;ed if her marriage were &s;anctioned by her aunt's approbation, yet, the want of &s;uch ap|probation &s;hould not prevent it."</P>
<P>The fact was, that mr. Mordaunt, from the fir&s;t time in which he beheld Maria, had became violently and truly in love with her. There was &s;omething in the humility and verity of his pa&s;&s;ion, that had been peculiarly plea&s;ing to her vanity; his addre&s;s and his per&s;on had charmed her; &s;he &s;aw his attentions were &s;ought for by the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of her companions; it became, therefore, a point of honour to attach him to her&s;elf: But, when &s;he learnt that he was the object of the tendere&s;t love to her mo&s;t intimate friend, &s;he was re&s;olved to make him her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Mrs. Forte&s;cue, de&s;pairing of the effect of her own influence with her niece, &s;aw no other means to prevent a marriage which &s;he &s;o much di&s;ap|proved, except by the force of parental authority; &s;he applied to lord Villars, repre&s;enting to him the entire de&s;truction of tho&s;e ambitious hopes, the uncommon beauty and attractions of Maria had given birth to, if &s;he were thus permitted to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf: But lord Villars, however he might wi&s;h that the inclinations of his daughter had taken another bent, was too much engaged in the cares and intere&s;ts that had ari&s;en from a &s;econd marriage, to be&s;tow much thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> trouble on the affairs of a child, e&s;tranged from
<PB N="9" REF="036127_0007_10084F111D9EFE18">
him &s;ince her birth, and whom he con&s;idered as being totally &s;poiled by the weak indulgence of her aunt; he therefore told his &s;i&s;ter, that &s;he mu&s;t abide by the con&s;equences of her own mi&s;|conduct; that ten thou&s;and pounds was the whole of what he could &s;pare to his daughter on her marriage, but that the re&s;t of the &s;ettlement would be her's at his death, and that &s;he mu&s;t endeavour to make the be&s;t bargain &s;he could.</P>
<P>Mrs. Forte&s;cue thus finding that all oppo&s;ition would be vain, no longer troubled her&s;elf to op|po&s;e what &s;he could not prevent. Mr. Mordaunt was made the happie&s;t of men, by being told Maria Villars was to be his wife; and Maria her|&s;elf took the air of &s;acrificing ambition and avarice at the &s;hrine of love. She became, in truth, du|ring the time of the court&s;hip, as much in love with mr. Mordaunt, as &s;he could be with any man. As to mr. Mordaunt, he was not more enchanted with her beauty, nor captivated by the graces of her manner, than he was impre&s;&s;ed with gratitude, for the preference &s;he gave him; he con&s;idered &s;uch a preference as a proof of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted affection, and entertained not a doubt but that in the lovely mi&s;tre&s;s he was about to po&s;&s;e&s;s, he &s;hould find the good humoured com|panion, the affectionate friend, and the faithful wife; he knew not, nor would it have been in the power of an angel from heaven to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him believe that Maria Villars was to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of his happine&s;s, and the &s;courge of his c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Maria, it is true, had &s;uffered her&s;elf, equa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with mr.

influence on the happine&s;s of that life; but &s;he had not, like him, added, even in imagination, the qualities either of the head or heart; &s;he had not thought about them. The man who was in love with her, was, of cour&s;e, at her di&s;po&s;al; &s;he did not &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar mi&s;tru&s;t her charms, as to &s;u&s;pect that this might not always be the ca&s;e, and while &s;he could pre&s;erve an unlimited power over the actions of mr. Mordaunt, &s;he &s;ought for no other quality on which to ground happine&s;s; there was no one excellence of the head or heart, nor all the po&s;&s;i|ble excellencies of both united, that &s;he would not have exchanged for the &s;ingle virtue of unli|mited compliance with her wi&s;hes: But mr. Mor|daunt was formed by nature to have be&s;towed happine&s;s of a very different kind from that which Maria required&mdash;with perfectly good and clear &s;en&s;e, of a calm and gentle mind, with kind af|fections, and the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted di&s;po&s;itions, had he met with a heart and temper congenial to his own, there was no degree of dome&s;tic felicity that he was not capable of giving and receiving.</P>
<P>It would have been mr. Mordaunt's wi&s;h upon his marriage, to have withdrawn from &s;cenes of di&s;&s;ipation and expence, (at once &s;o adver&s;e to his inclination, and &s;o inimical to his fortune), to his paternal e&s;tate in Northumberland. But to this plan mrs. Forte&s;cue and Maria were equally aver&s;e, and mr. Mordaunt ea&s;ily found in the gaiety of youth, and the inveteracy of habit, a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for this oppo&s;ition to his wi&s;hes; &mdash;he hoped time, and the cares of a mother, which he &s;aw with plea&s;ure would &s;oon belong to Maria, would produce di&s;po&s;itions more &s;uited to his own, and in the mean while he made his happine&s;s by contributing to her's. He was, how|ever,
<PB N="11" REF="036127_0009_10084F1582247A28">
&s;omewhat more alarmed when he found, that even after the birth of a daughter, her rage for amu&s;ement &s;eemed greater than ever; and long before his tenderne&s;s thought &s;he ought to have quitted her hou&s;e, he found her eager again to emerge into the world, to form new engage|ments and to &s;eek new plea&s;ures: She had ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to &s;uckle her child, and he had been made to believe that her health was too de|licate to admit of her performing &s;uch an office; but when he &s;aw it &s;ufficiently robu&s;t to encoun|ter the vigils of balls and a&s;&s;emblies, and the har|ra&s;&s;ing exertions of morning amu&s;ements, he fir&s;t uttered his &s;urpri&s;e and then ventured to remon&s;trate.</P>
<P>It was the fir&s;t moment in which he had appeared to have a will di&s;tinct from that of Maria. The ve|hemence which &s;he betrayed upon this occa&s;ion a&s;toni&s;hed and alarmed him; but the veil was now fallen, and from this hour &s;he appeared in her na|tural form. The imperfections of temper in a wife, although &s;ufficient to de&s;troy happine&s;s, are, how|ever, &s;eldom powerful enough to pluck from the brea&s;t of a tender hearted man a deep rooted love. Mr. Mordaunt was compelled to be mi&s;erable, but he could not cea&s;e to love. It was not &s;o with Maria, &s;he had never loved&mdash;&s;he never could love any one but her&s;elf: While mr. Mor|daunt contributed to her convenience, or her plea|&s;ure, &s;he &s;miled upon him with a complacency that made him believe him&s;elf the happie&s;t of men; when he thwarted her mo&s;t extravagant wi&s;hes, &s;he armed her brow with defiance, and his hours were pa&s;&s;ed in wrangling and ill humour.</P>
<P>For &s;ome of the fir&s;t years of their marriage, the dread of interrupting tho&s;e moments of &s;un|&s;hine from which he drew his precarious and li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="12" REF="036127_0010_10084F1AF467C580">
enjoyed happine&s;s, made him give up, undi&s;puted, almo&s;t every point to his wife. Her habit of con|troul became by this means the more confirmed; and afterwards, when this rea&s;on cea&s;ed (for there were no longer moments of &s;un&s;hine), the embar|ra&s;&s;ment of his affairs, and the dread that all minds, not &s;trong, feel of probing the bottom of an evil, occa&s;ioned him to go on in the &s;ame way. Thus at the end of ten years, he found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his hopes of happine&s;s, involved in debt, the father of three mi&s;erable neglected girls, and the hu&s;band of a decayed beauty, who&s;e health had been ruined by di&s;&s;ipation, and who&s;e temper, not naturally good, had been irritated by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of poverty: Her heart and her un|der&s;tanding offered no re&s;ources in the hour of di&s;appointment, and her continual &s;elf reproaches for having &s;o fooli&s;hly thrown her&s;elf away, awakened mr. Mordaunt to a wandering &s;en&s;e, how the mo&s;t beautiful features, or the mo&s;t per|fect form, could ever have been a veil &s;ufficiently thick, to have concealed from his ob&s;ervation the deformity of her temper, and the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of her heart.</P>
<P>As to what was now to be done, there remained no option: mrs. Forte&s;cue had &s;o often relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of her niece that &s;he had no longer the power of doing &s;o&mdash;The ten thou&s;and pounds paid at her marriage, were di&s;&s;ipated&mdash; of the ten that were to be received on the death of lord Villars, the intere&s;t only could be of any u&s;e, as the principal was &s;ettled upon children. Creditors were numerous and pre&s;&s;ing; there was no alternative but a jail, or the family man&s;ion in Northumberland.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt, with a degree of re&s;olution
<PB N="13" REF="036127_0011_10084F1DF6BBDF10">
which might have been the preventative ten years before, of the evils, for which it was now &s;carcely an alleviation, &s;old all his property, in or near town, and packing up his wife, him&s;elf, their three daughters, and one woman &s;ervant, in the only carriage they had left, this ruined family be|gan their journey into Northumberland.</P>
<P>Maria, although &s;he had nothing to oppo&s;e to a mea&s;ure &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable, yet had not fortitude enough to &s;ubmit to it without the bittere&s;t lamentations, and the deepe&s;t grief: She parted from mrs. Forte&s;cue as if &s;he had been go|ing into a Siberian exile, and mrs. Forte&s;cue her|&s;elf would, with le&s;s grief, have followed her to her grave, than thus have &s;een her, at eight and twenty, bani&s;hed from all that &s;he held valuable in life, and buried in the frightful glooms of a Northern &s;olitude. But grief, however violent and tempe&s;tuous, brings no balm to irremed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble evils. After &s;ome days of vehemence, complaints, and tears&mdash;after others of a &s;ullen &s;ilence and ill humoured di&s;content, mrs. Mordaunt found her|&s;elf, in &s;pite of all her grief and reluctance, &s;et|tled at Groby Manor, compelled to attend to the common affairs of life, and her influence confined to the circle of a &s;mall country family, three hun|dred miles di&s;tant from London.</P>

<P>GROBY MANOR was &s;ituate about thirty miles from the &s;ea coa&s;t, at the head of a narrow valley, the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of which were formed by a variety of high and differently &s;haped hills, well wooded, with here and there a green meadow or a corn field i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter&s;per&s;ed. Through the valley ran a clear &s;tream, and there were a variety of plea&s;ant and romantic walks on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e had, for many generations, been the re&s;idence of a re&s;pectable and well beloved family: It contained large and convenient rooms, and though the furniture was old, it was &s;ufficiently plentiful. The hou&s;e was &s;heltered from every cutting wind, and open only to a &s;outhern expo|&s;ure; it was warm and comfortable, provi&s;ions and coals were cheap and abundant, there was a good library, and the air, clear and whole&s;ome, gave colour to the cheek, and vigour to the limbs.</P>
<P>Here, then, were &s;ources enough of enjoy|ment, were the mind capable of reli&s;hing them; but mrs. Mordaunt &s;eemed re&s;olved that as &s;he

was to be le&s;s happy than &s;he wi&s;hed to be, &s;he would be as mi&s;erable as &s;he could. She pa&s;&s;ed her days in &s;ullen di&s;content and unavailing re|pining, refu&s;ing all &s;ociety, and rendering tho&s;e who were obliged to approach her as mi&s;erable as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>With mr. Mordaunt it was otherwi&s;e.&mdash; Having once broken the chains that tied him to a life he di&s;approved, his natural temper began to manife&s;t it&s;elf in beneficial effects to him&s;elf and all around him. He was delighted to be returned to the &s;eat of his forefathers; joy &s;prang in his heart at the &s;ight of the &s;cenes of his infancy; he rejoiced to renew the &s;ocial connections of his former neighbourhood, and to bu&s;y him&s;elf in the cares and occupations of a country life. He &s;aw, with a &s;atisfaction, that tranquilized his &s;leeping, and gladdened his waking hours, that ten years of prudent retirement would clear his e&s;tate. In the&s;e ten years he hoped to recompen&s;e to his daughters, the evil they had hitherto received from neglect and ill education; and he con&s;idered the end as being &s;carcely more de&s;irable than the means.</P>
<P>He endeavoured, by gentlene&s;s and the kinde&s;t affection, to &s;often the mind of Mari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and to open it to a capability of enjoyment: He &s;till loved her: he therefore ea&s;ily per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that time and the ea&s;y undi&s;turbed life &s;he was henceforth to lead, might work this miracle; he was willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay all her faults on the mi&s;takes of her educatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the folly of her former life.</P>

<P>Twelve months were now elap&s;ed &s;ince mr. Mordaunt's removal into the country, and Maria began to be &s;omewhat more reconciled to her &s;ituation. She was not the le&s;s reconciled from ob&s;erving the effect that the change in her manner of living had upon her beauty:&mdash;The regularity of her life, and the purity of the air, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lu&s;hed her faded cheek with health, and had re&s;tored the lu&s;tre to her eye, her limbs had recovered their roundne&s;s, and her complexion its tran&s;parency; &s;he heard the ru&s;tic prai&s;es of the pea&s;ants when|ever &s;he walked out, and her own maid had not &s;o far forgotten her old trade, as not carefully to repeat, &s;ometimes with, and &s;ometimes without, ex|aggeration, the commendations that were retailed by &s;ervants from the dining parlours of their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>She was con&s;cious of the di&s;gu&s;t &s;he had given to all their neighbours on her fir&s;t coming into the country; &s;he had then &s;carce thought it worth her while to remember the exi&s;tence of beings whom &s;he con&s;idered as little above the brute creation: but to the plea&s;ure of admiration it was not po&s;|&s;ible, while &s;he continued to breathe, that &s;he &s;hould long be in&s;en&s;ible. She endeavoured to apologize for her former conduct, by imputing it to ill health, and &s;he gave an appearance of truth to her apology, by now &s;hewing a willingne&s;s to enter into &s;ociety, and to partake of &s;uch plea&s;ure as the country afforded.</P>

Mr. Mordaunt could not but be plea&s;ed with this im|provement in his wife's temper: but he &s;oon found it was confined wholly to tho&s;e hours when &s;he was engaged with company, either from home, or in her own hou&s;e; he &s;aw, with the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible mortification, that this amendment, how|ever, aro&s;e only from the gratification of her va|nity: to him &s;he was always alike cold and in&s;en|&s;ible, always equally neglectful of her children, and intolerable to her dome&s;tics.

<P>HAD Maria been more amiable, they might now have been happy. They were now &s;ettled with a &s;mall but comfortable e&s;tabli&s;hment, upon an equal footing with their neighbours, &s;ufficiently bu&s;ied to feel no want of employment, and &s;uffi|ciently idle to be in no danger of fatigue. They had no particular cares to mole&s;t them. They enjoyed health and a competency: and if they had not much to hope they had al&s;o not much to fear.</P>
<P>But, in a life where happine&s;s mu&s;t ari&s;e from a di&s;charge of duty alone, Maria found no charms. She was &s;en&s;ible only to wearine&s;s. As &s;ome re|lief from this eternal &s;amene&s;s, &s;he was not di&s;|plea&s;ed to find her&s;elf with child. To give her|&s;elf more con&s;equence, and the circum&s;tance more intere&s;t, &s;he took it into her head to imagine that &s;he longed pa&s;&s;ionately for a boy. By talking perpetually on the &s;ubject, and expatiating on the maternal raptures &s;he was about to feel, and the maternal cares in which &s;he was henceforth to be engaged, &s;he had converted what was at fir&s;t merely a whim, into a &s;erious pa&s;&s;ion. She counted the months, the weeks as they pa&s;&s;ed. Every day might now complete her wi&s;hes. The hour came, and&mdash;&s;he was delivered of a daughter!</P>
<P>From the moment &s;he beheld her, the poor child's de&s;tiny, as far as it depended upon the af|fection of its mother, was decided. 'It was
<PB N="19" REF="036127_0017_10084F2FFB5F7298">
hideous. She &s;aw every bad pa&s;&s;ion in its counte|nance. It looked like an owl, like an ape, like aunt Nelly.'&mdash;Invective could go no farther.</P>
<P>This aunt Nelly, the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of abhorrence, had been the &s;i&s;ter of mr. Mordaunt. Her brea&s;t was the man&s;ion of every female virtue. She had been the being in the world, next to Maria, that mr. Mordaunt had mo&s;t fondly loved. Being by many years his &s;enior, &s;he had been the nur&s;e of his childhood, the gentle monitor of his youth|ful days, the warm and &s;teady friend of his manly years. On his marriage, he had eagerly &s;ent for her to town, that &s;he might know and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e known to one, whom he thought her only &s;uperior. He told his Maria, 'that in the friend&s;hip of his &s;i&s;ter, &s;he would find all the advantage of &s;uperior wi&s;|dom and perfect goodne&s;s. He did not bid her love her: he knew it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould do otherwi&s;e; and as to his &s;i&s;ter, &s;he would doat upon Maria as her child.'</P>
<P>All this might have been, and would have been, had Maria been the per&s;on mr. Mordaunt be|lieved her to be. But, with her &s;arca&s;tic &s;pirit, and &s;elf con&s;equence, virtue and wi&s;dom, in the form of a plain, though intelligent looking wo|man of five and forty, were likely only to produce contempt and &s;atire. She quarrelled with every feature in her face in the fir&s;t half hour of their acquaintance; ridiculed her to her companions; &s;coffed at her to her woman&punc; and in the con|&s;trained civility that &s;he thought proper to &s;hew her before mr. Mordaunt evinced, to a woman of mi&s;s Mordaunt's penetration, the aver&s;ion &s;he had taken to her. Nor was it le&s;s difficult to di&s;cover the mi&s;take that mr. Mordaunt had made in his choice: and Maria's aver&s;ion to her &s;i&s;ter-in-law
<PB N="20" REF="036127_0018_10084F3425466B60">
was increa&s;ed by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that it could not be hid from her.</P>
<P>This aver&s;ion, however, might have worn off, could mrs. Mordaunt have found real cau&s;e for the contempt &s;he expre&s;&s;ed towards mi&s;s Mor|daunt: but &s;he &s;oon was compelled to feel for this hated &s;i&s;ter, a re&s;pect, which her virtue in|&s;pired, and a dread which her under&s;tanding im|po&s;ed. This re&s;pect, this dread, converted di&s;like into hatred. She was &s;en&s;ible, her conduct would ju&s;tify animadver&s;ion&punc; and &s;he had no doubt but &s;he received it from mi&s;s Mordaunt. She looked upon he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y; and hated her accordingly.</P>
<P>During mr. Mordaunt's re&s;idence in London, mi&s;s Mordaunt had vi&s;ited town from time to time, for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing her brother. She had very early di&s;covered that he was unhappy: and although he did not complain, &s;he perceived her company was a relief to him. She therefore never &s;uffered twelve months to pa&s;s without &s;pending a few weeks in lodgings in town, contributing, by this means, all in her power toward his happi|ne&s;s, and indulging her&s;elf in the plea&s;ure &s;he received from the company of his children. She endeavoured all &s;he&punc; could to counteract the evil they imbibed at home, and &s;he &s;ought, by every method, to in&s;pire them with love towards her|&s;elf. In this latter particular, &s;he &s;o completely &s;ucceeded, that the poor girls loved nothing half &s;o well as aunt Nelly.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances confirmed Maria's ha|tred: and almo&s;t the only act of maternity &s;he ever exerci&s;ed was, the giving her elde&s;t girl a whipping, on her &s;aying, as her mother was put|ting on her morning bonnet, 'Now, mamma looks like aunt Nelly.'</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="036127_0019_10084F35EDA0EC68">Two years before mr. Mordaunt's removal into the country, mi&s;s Mordaunt had been &s;eized with a di&s;order which prevented her &s;tirring from home; and having langui&s;hed under every painful circum&s;tances for eighteen months, &s;he had at length been relea&s;ed from, and rewarded for her &s;uf|ferings. Her death had been a &s;evere affliction to mr. Mordaunt: and he cheri&s;hed her memory with the highe&s;t degree of tenderne&s;s and venera|tion. It was not, therefore, with mr. Mordaunt, that the &s;uppo&s;ed likene&s;s of his new-born child to aunt Nelly, was likely to operate to her di&s;ad|vantage; nor was the unrea&s;onable aver&s;ion that mrs. Mordaunt had taken to the poor infa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one whit more prejudicial to her with her father; for when he beheld the inveteracy with which his wife per&s;i&s;ted in her dete&s;tation of &s;o excellent a creature as his &s;i&s;ter had been, and when he compared the parade &s;he now made of her feelings, as a mother, with the ab&s;olute neglect &s;he had hitherto &s;hewn to her offspring, all partiality was for the moment at an end; and he viewed her with a degree of di&s;ap|probation, that &s;eemed to prohibit the po&s;&s;ibility of its ever again being renewed.</P>
<P>There was one point, however, even on this &s;ubject, in which mr. and mrs. Mordaunt agreed: this was, in giving the name of Ellen to the poor little girl. Maria cho&s;e it, that &s;he might gratify her &s;pite in calling the child, "aunt Nelly;" and mr. Mordaunt was fond of perpetuating a name that had belonged to a &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e memory (per|haps by comparing her character with that of his wife) grew every day dearer to him.</P>

<P>IT was not merely in the airy nothing of a name that mrs. Mordaunt exerci&s;ed her di&s;like to her unhappy infant. The inextingui&s;hable de&s;ire that &s;he had of being ever the object of attention and ob&s;ervation, made her &s;eek for means to perpe|tuate her con&s;equence, when youth and beauty (however di&s;tant &s;he might at pre&s;ent con&s;ider that period) &s;hould be no more.</P>
<P>To be the principal object wherever &s;he ap|peared, had been the fir&s;t wi&s;h to which &s;he had been con&s;cious, and it was likely to be the la&s;t of which &s;he would be &s;en&s;ible. The fa&s;hionable furor for education pre&s;ented her the means &s;he &s;ought. She could no longer eclip&s;e rival beau|ties at a ball: &s;he could no longer &s;trike the fangs of envy into a heart &s;imilar to her own, by the &s;uperior elegance of her head dre&s;s, or the &s;plen|dor of her equipage. All her triumphs were confined within the circle of a &s;mall neighbour|hood, far remote from the &s;cene of all her former di&s;tinctions, and where the inquiries of the cu|rious were more directed to the dome&s;tic economy of their neighbours, than to the form of their clothes, or the fa&s;hion of their carriages. To

this neighbourhood &s;he re&s;olved to be known as the mo&s;t educating mother in it. Her elder daughters were too old, and too much under the wi&s;er care of their father, to be proper objects on which to di&s;play her abilities in this new road to di&s;tinction: but the new born infant was her undi&s;puted property, and &s;he re&s;olved to pour all the terrors of education on poor Ellen's head.</P>
<P>In this de&s;ign, &s;o wi&s;ely and &s;o benevolently formed, &s;he &s;ucceeded &s;o perfectly, that at the early age of twelve months, when other children know their mothers only as their &s;ure&s;t &s;ource of indulgence, Maria was become &s;o completely an object of terror to her child, that &s;he &s;carce looked upon her without trembling, or appeared before her without tears. It &s;eemed too, as if every circum&s;tance was to con&s;pire to render the infancy of Ellen wretched. In le&s;s than fifteen months after her birth, the eagerly de&s;ired boy was borne, and, as if this unnatural mother po&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but a certain degree of affection, the little tenderne&s;s that &s;he had hitherto manife&s;ted towards Ellen, was all withdrawn, to be added to that which &s;he profu&s;ely lavi&s;hed on the boy. Be&s;ides which, Ellen was always wrong in every thing &s;he did, or every thing &s;he did not do, for her brother. If &s;he care&s;&s;ed him, &s;he would &s;mother the child&mdash; If &s;he &s;tood aloof, &s;he was a little in&s;en&s;ible, without affections; and then &s;he had a flap or a pu&s;h, or her play things were taken from her, or &s;he was &s;ometimes whipped, &s;he did not know for why, or for what.</P>
<P>The age of teaching now came on, and mrs. Mordaunt was re&s;olved to teach. But the truth was, that &s;he had never learn. Her own ideas of what &s;he meant to convey were too indi&s;tinct,
<PB N="24" REF="036127_0022_10084F3F1F7DCC50">
to enable her to communicate them to another. Her method was unintelligible, and her impatience extreme. Ellen could learn nothing&mdash;it was &s;tu|pidity&mdash;it was ob&s;tinacy. She had always fore|told that &s;he had the wor&s;t di&s;po&s;itions of human nature&mdash;puni&s;hment followed puni&s;hment, 'till by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch teaching and &s;uch correc|tion, that very &s;tupidity and ob&s;tinacy were nearly produced, which they were de&s;igned to correct.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt was not an inattentive &s;pectator of all this; but he was far from under&s;tanding the real truth of the ca&s;e. The early terror that had been impre&s;&s;ed on the mind of Ellen, had made her appear, even to mr. Mordaunt, as a child of a &s;low capacity, and &s;omewhat of a &s;ullen di&s;po&s;i|tion. He was often witne&s;s to what were repre|&s;ented to him as fits of ob&s;tinacy, and &s;ometimes to moments of violence. He feared Ellen might re&s;emble her mother, and thought a little cor|rection might be nece&s;&s;ary. With the degree and frequency of the puni&s;hment he was wholly unacquainted: and as it is ea&s;y to put a child in the wrong, mrs. Mordaunt took care that Ellen &s;hould always appear &s;o to her father. But how|ever mr. Mordaunt might, for a certain time, have been per&s;uaded, that his wife's mode of treating his daughter was &s;alutary, or nece&s;&s;ary, experience convinced him it was inefficacious. At &s;ix years old, Ellen could &s;carcely read: and he ob&s;erved, with inexpre&s;&s;ible pain, a &s;ullen indifference to all in&s;truction or reproof pervading her mind.</P>
<P>Maria had never been her hu&s;band's friend&punc; for many years &s;he had cea&s;ed to be his confidant: and the ingenuous mind of mr. Mordaunt had &s;uffered the &s;evere&s;t mortification when he had found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;acrifice the plea&s;ure of com|munication
<PB N="25" REF="036127_0023_10084F4203D99498">
to the dictates of prudence. Since his re&s;idence in Northumberland, he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, however, both a friend and a confidant, to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he opened his heart whenever he was oppre&s;&s;ed with di&s;&s;atisfaction or perplexed with doubt. This friend and this confidant was the clergyman of the pari&s;h, who&s;e benevolence had never &s;ailed to &s;ooth his &s;orrows, or his judgment to enlighten his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>To mr. Thornton he revealed the fears and grief that the character of Ellen excited in his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>"Give me leave to invite my wife to make one of our party," &s;aid mr. Thornton. "I am mi&s;taken if &s;he will not give you comfort."</P>
<P>Mrs Thornton was only in the next room. She obeyed her hu&s;band's &s;ummons; &s;he &s;at down, and heard mr. Mordaunt's di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Your child, my dear &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "is neither &s;tupid nor ill di&s;po&s;ed. Wrong methods have been taken with her. Terror has overwhelmed the powers of her mind, and deadened her affec|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion. Convince her &s;he is beloved, and &s;he will be and do every thing you can de&s;ire."</P>
<P>"How is it po&s;&s;ible, madam," &s;aid mr. Mor|daunt, "that you &s;hould have formed &s;o contrary, and &s;o much more favourable an opinion of Ellen, than I, with all my partiality, have been able to entertain?"</P>
<P>"She loves me, &s;ir," returned mrs. Thornton; "and &s;he loves me, becau&s;e &s;he believes I love her. If &s;he can love one per&s;on, &s;he can love another. She is willing to learn of me: and only the la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e I was with her, I taught her a le&s;&s;on in ten minutes, that &s;he told me &s;he had been the three preceding days in vain attempting to learn. Do you a&s;k other proofs?"</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="036127_0024_10084F43D94EBE98">"No," cried mr. Mordaunt: "but I have farther favours to a&s;k of you. You mu&s;t take this poor child under your care, my dear mrs. Thornton. You mu&s;t take her and make her all you &s;ay &s;he is capable of being made."</P>
<P>After a little more conver&s;ation, all the parti|culars of this plan were &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Mrs. Thornton had long &s;een Ellen's &s;ufferings with pity; and was happy to contribute all in her power to put an end to them. Mrs. Mor|daunt, convinced that Ellen would do no credit to her mode of education, and tired of the trou|ble &s;he gave her, ea&s;ily con&s;ented to part with her.</P>
<P>The par&s;onage, to which Ellen was now re|moved, was &s;carcely half a mile di&s;tant from Groby Manor: and it was &s;ituated at the other end of the valley. So near a neighbourhood en|abled mr. Mordaunt to &s;ee his daughter every day; and he &s;aw her every day with increa&s;ed &s;atisfaction. Her pallid cheeks, hitherto robbed of their colour, by the continual wa&s;hing of tears, began to be tinged with a faint red. Her &s;ullen eye, formerly fixed gloomily on the ground, was often now rai&s;ed timidly to the per&s;on who &s;poke to her, and &s;ometimes ca&s;t forth beams of intelli|gence and gaiety. If &s;he did not run to meet her father when he approached her, &s;he ventured to pre&s;s the hand that held her's: and &s;ometimes would &s;he re&s;t her head upon his &s;houlder: and he could perceive, as &s;he rai&s;ed it, a tear tremble in her eye, which he could attribute only to the tenderne&s;s of her heart, re&s;pon&s;ive to its care<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Mr. Mordaunt left no method untried to &s;ecure her affections: and every day now gave him a

more perfect a&s;&s;urance that he was not un&s;uc|ce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Ellen had been about &s;ix months in her new &s;ituation, when the illne&s;s of lord Villars called mr. and mrs. Mordaunt into Hamp&s;hire. His in|di&s;po&s;ition was long, and terminated in his death.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mordaunt, very well plea&s;ed to find her|&s;elf once again in her old world, caught at every po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on for prolonging her &s;tay. Her bro|ther, now lord Villars, had been married &s;ome years. She had &s;een little of him during this period. He pre&s;&s;ed her &s;o much to continue in Hamp&s;hire the remainder of the &s;ummer, that mr. Mordaunt con&s;ented &s;he &s;hould do &s;o. But he con&s;ented upon condition that their three elder daughters &s;hould join them there. He thought it de&s;irable to have them known to their neare&s;t connexions: and he was willing to give them &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances, in &s;ome exterior accompli&s;hments, as the di&s;tant &s;ituation of Northumberland had not hitherto allowed them. The boy had never been &s;eparated from his mother.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt's condition was joyfully ac|cepted. The &s;ummer pa&s;&s;ed plea&s;antly with them all: and when the time for repairing to London approached, mrs. Forte&s;cue (now a widow) &s;o vehemently urged the melancholy of returning into Northumberland at that &s;ea&s;on, and &s;o kindly offered the whole family apartments in her hou&s;e, that mr. Mordaunt again con&s;ented to prolong his ab&s;ence from home.</P>
<P>The family had not been &s;ettled more than a month in town, when mrs. Forte&s;cue was &s;eized with a fever, of which &s;he died in about a fort|night. On her death is was found &s;he had be|queathed to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mordaunt all &s;he had in her
<PB N="28" REF="036127_0026_10084F4B6ABF7B40">
power to di&s;po&s;e of. This all con&s;i&s;ted in a &s;mall country man&s;ion, with an e&s;tate of about 200l. a year about it. It was &s;ituated within ten miles of lord Villars's hou&s;e, in the country; and was furni&s;hed and fitted up with all the elegance of modern ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Whatever tears mrs. Mordaunt might &s;hed for the lo&s;s of a partial, though mi&s;taken, friend&mdash;for one, who had not only been her &s;teady advocate through life, but who had proved her benefactre&s;s at her death, were &s;oon dried up by the thoughts of the independence that friend had &s;ecured to her, and &s;till more by reflections on the place where the property which gave her that independ|ence was &s;ituated. She immediately declared her intentions of going to Hadley Lodge directly upon leaving town. But &s;he al&s;o prote&s;ted, that &s;he meant not to leave London 'till the middle of June. The hou&s;e &s;he was at pre&s;ent in was to continue her's for &s;ix months, and &s;he therefore &s;aw no rea&s;on why the event of mrs. Forte&s;cue's death &s;hould abridge the &s;cheme of plea&s;ure that &s;he had laid down for theen&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt felt it har&s;h to oppo&s;e any of the&s;e re&s;olutions, &s;ince they were not (in con&s;e|quence of their new acqui&s;itions) liable to the cen&s;ure of imprudence in a pecuniary light. He therefore acquie&s;ced, re&s;erving however to him|&s;elf the power of vi&s;iting Ellen and Northumber|land: and this he propo&s;ed to do when mrs. Mordaunt and her family removed to Hadley Lodge.</P>
<P>In the execution of this plan, he was, however, prevented. The death of a di&s;tant relation, who had for many years re&s;ided in the We&s;t-Indies, made it nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould him&s;elf cro&s;s the At|lantic.
<PB N="29" REF="036127_0027_10084F4EB26A8650">
Property of &s;ome value had devolved to him; but the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of it was di&s;puted: and it was attended with &s;ome circum&s;tances that made it nece&s;&s;ary, if he meant to pro&s;ecute his claim to it, to vi&s;it the i&s;land where it lay.</P>
<P>He would willingly have per&s;uaded mrs. Mor|daunt to have re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed into Northumberland, there to have remained during his ab&s;ence; but to per&s;uade her was impo&s;&s;ible, and to compel her to a mea&s;ure &s;o di&s;agreeable to her&s;elf, on the eve of a &s;eparation that might be for a con&s;iderable length of time, was what the &s;oftne&s;s of mr. Mordaunt's feelings would not permit; it was therefore agreed that &s;he &s;hould re&s;ide at her own hou&s;e while he was ab&s;ent, and he flattered him|&s;elf that the neighbourhood of her brother might be &s;ome re&s;traint upon her indi&s;cretion, and af|ford protection and coun&s;el to his girls, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f any circum&s;tance &s;hould ari&s;e, during his ab&s;ence, in which they wanted either.</P>
<P>The time was &s;hort in which he was to arrange all this; he recommended his family to lord Vil|lars, and &s;ailed for Jamaica.</P>
<P>By unfore&s;een circum&s;tances and unavoidable delays, his ab&s;ence was prolonged to the begin|ning of the fifth year, and he returned &s;omething poorer than he &s;at out.</P>
<P>Immediately on his arrival in England mr. Mordaunt ha&s;tened to Hadley Lodge, but no comfort awaited him there&mdash;He found his elde&s;t daughter married to a man of libertine character and di&s;&s;ipated fortune, who&s;e recommendation, in the eyes of mrs. Mordaunt, had been his fa&s;hionable manners, and his connexions with people of rank.</P>
<P>The boy, now ten years old, had continued,
<PB N="30" REF="036127_0028_10084F5187772200">
in &s;pite of mrs. Mordaunt's repeated injunctions to the contrary, in his mother's hou&s;e, where he had remained ignorant of every thing he ought to have learnt, and became acquainted with almo&s;t every thing he ought not to have known.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mordaunt her&s;elf was embarra&s;&s;ed with debts, and of the independence, of which &s;he had made &s;o ill a u&s;e, but little remained.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt could &s;carcely forbear reproach|ing lord Villars for the little attention he appeared to have given to his &s;i&s;ter and her children; but when he con&s;idered that he had him&s;elf the cares of a large family upon him, and a numerous train of half brothers and &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e intere&s;t he was compelled to attend to, and reflected upon his character, in which &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s was the predo|minant feature, he thought it be&s;t to forbear re|proaches, which would now be made in vain, and which might tend to interrupt the friendly inter|cour&s;e there had hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him|&s;elf and lord Villars. In reproaches to him&s;elf, however, he was not &s;paring: he felt too bitterly, the con&s;equences of his ill choice in a wife, not to call him &s;everely to an account for having &s;uf|fered his eyes to mi&s;lead his judgment.</P>
<P>Northumberland was again the re&s;ource: and as mrs. Mordaunt had now no power to remain in Hamp&s;hire without the permi&s;&s;ion of her hu&s;|band, &s;he knew it was in vain to oppo&s;e her wi&s;hes to his, &s;he therefore prepared, however reluc|tantly, for her departure; but the delays which &s;he artfully threw in the way, having exhau&s;ted mr. Mordaunt's patience, he left her to follow him at her lei&s;ure, and &s;et out for Northum|berland, accompanied only by the &s;econd &s;on of lord Villars, a youth of fifteen.</P>

<P>AS mr. Mordaunt approached Groby Manor, his impatience to behold the effects that more than five years mu&s;t have wrought in Ellen, be|came extreme.</P>
<P>He was &s;ometimes willing to hope, that having been removed from mrs. Mordaunt's baneful in|fluence, &s;he might compen&s;ate to him for all the other dome&s;tic di&s;appointments that influence had produced; at others, the remembrance of tho&s;e faults which he had been accu&s;tomed to call na|tural to her di&s;po&s;ition, recurred to his mind, and overclouded it with the di&s;piriting fear that no difference of treatment could have been powerful enough to correct them; yet mrs. Thornton, though &s;he had &s;aid nothing of her mental abili|ties, had &s;poken much of her docility. If I find her, &s;aid mr. Mordaunt to him&s;elf, gentle and af|fectionate, I will compound for a moderate ca|pacity, and give up willingly all preten&s;ions to talents or accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts occupied him &s;o much, that not all the comicality and &s;prightly under&s;tanding of his companion could always awake him from
<PB N="32" REF="036127_0030_10084F5633FAB3A0">
his reverie: and Henry, who had as much feeling as gaiety, impo&s;ed &s;ilence upon him&s;elf, that he might not prove trouble&s;ome to his uncle.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt re&s;ted not a moment at Groby Manor; but with a long &s;tep, and ha&s;ty move|ment, that made Henry laugh, proceeded down the valley to the par&s;onage.</P>
<P>As he approached the hou&s;e he heard the &s;ound of a fiddle; and immediately after &s;aw a&s;&s;embled on the green before the door, ten or twelve girls of different ages, who were dancing gaily to the mu&s;ic. Mr. Mordaunt &s;topped &s;hort. He &s;ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;cover Ellen before &s;he was pointed out to him; and Henry ru&s;hed forward that he might join in the amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>"Might that be her," &s;aid mr. Mordaunt, "might that &s;pright', good-humoured looking blooming girl be her, my wi&s;hes would be more than an&s;wered."</P>
<P>His wi&s;hes were more than an&s;wered. It was Ellen her&s;elf. The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed. The whole group was in confu&s;ion: and the next moment Ellen, with an emotion that charmed him, was in the arms of her father.</P>
<P>"My dear child, my beloved Ellen, can I ever part with you again?"</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, this very moment, my dear uncle," cried Henry. "What! am I not to have a dozen ki&s;&s;es at lea&s;t of my cou&s;in?"</P>
<P>"And are you my cou&s;in, <HI>too?</HI>" &s;aid Ellen, with one arm round her father's neck, and the other hand held out to Henry. "O, I did not know I was ever to have been &s;o happy!"</P>
<P>The pathos of the &s;cene was now over: but the delight remained: and Henry, having taken &s;ome|thing more than his dozen ki&s;&s;es, ran away with
<PB N="33" REF="036127_0031_10084F58D9E1D6D8">
Ellen to join her companions, and recommence the dance.</P>
<P>"You never told me," &s;aid mr. Mordaunt to mr. Thornton, "of the good-humour and intelli|gence that beam in Ellen's countenance, nor of the lightne&s;s of her movements, the delicacy of her limbs, and the ea&s;e of her &s;hape."</P>
<P>"Ellen is not a beauty," &s;aid mrs. Thornton, &s;miling.</P>
<P>"She is in her father's eyes," returned mr. Mordaunt: "and will be &s;o in tho&s;e of her lover."</P>
<P>"But you do not a&s;k, what I have attempted to teach her. You do not inquire, whether &s;he was capable of learning."</P>
<P>"I am almo&s;t indifferent what &s;he has learnt. With the di&s;po&s;itions that I &s;ee &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, &s;he will gratify my fonde&s;t wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>"But Ellen has not only di&s;po&s;itions," &s;aid mr. Thornton, "&s;he has powers. She is an ex|cellent arithmetician: &s;he is a good geographer: &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of all the rules of drawing: &s;he writes and &s;peaks French well; and has a very competent knowlege of Latin."</P>
<P>"To which let me add," &s;aid mrs. Thornton, "that &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of her needle; under&s;tands mu&s;ic tolerably; plays at che&s;s; and dances, walks, and plays at &s;huttlecock to admiration."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid mr. Mordaunt. "You flatter me."</P>
<P>"Nothing can be more true; and yet Ellen is no prodigy. She is what every girl of common &s;en&s;e and common application may be at her age."</P>
<P>"But how did you conquer her ob&s;tinacy? how did you &s;ubdue her violence?"</P>
<P>"I neither found her ob&s;tinate nor violent. I
<PB N="34" REF="036127_0032_10084F5E0EDC88F0" MS="y">
did not propo&s;e to her to do any thing but what &s;he &s;aw my own daughter, &s;omething younger than her&s;elf, do. Each day has its allotted bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and its allotted plea&s;ure. The &s;lowe&s;t ca|pacity could comprehend, that the more hours were con&s;umed in bu&s;ine&s;s, the fewer there would be for plea&s;ure. It is is only nece&s;&s;ary to lay down the premi&s;es, <HI>and to abide by them.</HI> The con|clu&s;ion every child can draw for it&s;elf. If that conclu&s;ion be as infallible as it is unplea&s;ant, in a little time it will be carefully avoided. To the rea&s;on of its in&s;tructors a child will not perhaps readily &s;ubmit. It is again&s;t rea&s;on that it &s;hould. But to the rea&s;on of facts children will always yield, provided it be made clear to them."</P>
<P>"Can it really be &s;o ea&s;y to give the be&s;t po&s;|&s;ible education to a child?"</P>
<P>"I do not &s;ay, that mine is the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible education; nor is it &s;o ea&s;y as it appears. To guard again&s;t the faults of the child is not half the bu&s;ine&s;s. The weakne&s;s of the tutor is much more inimical to the &s;ucce&s;s of his efforts&mdash;to be unyielding in matters (&s;imply con&s;idered) of little import&mdash;to bear a cold countenance with a warm heart&mdash;to be in&s;en&s;ible to the blandi&s;hments of childhood, where the good of the future man re|quires it&mdash;are not ea&s;y ta&s;ks to a feeling and affec|tionate mind; and no other is fitted for the ta&s;k of education. Then will not the tutor have to com|bat with his own indolence, his own unevenne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, his caprice, and his partialities? No, the ta&s;k of education is not ea&s;y; but it is the greate&s;t in which man or woman can be engaged; and ought therefore to be attended to by all who undertake it, with every energy of the mind. What I have chiefly wi&s;hed to avoid, was the doing too
<PB N="35" REF="036127_0033_10084F5F9B7530A8">
much. Not to do mi&s;chief, and to let the cau&s;es that produce good have their full operation, are two material points. I was aware, that the greate&s;t difficulty, in this important matter, aro&s;e from the weakne&s;&s;es of the in&s;tructors, and the indi&s;creet interference of others. Mr. Thornton and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ab&s;olute here, and as perfectly &s;teady, though &s;ometimes at the expen&s;e of a heart ache. Hence Ellen and Mary have learnt to con&s;ider our laws as immutable as the decrees of fate, and to accommodate them&s;elves to them, as they would do to any phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity. Con&s;tant application has made the ta&s;k of learning ea&s;y: and where &s;omething new, however little, is acquired every day, the &s;um total, at the end of five years, will be &s;urpri&s;ing."</P>
<P>"But do you allow nothing to natural di&s;po&s;i|tion, and to the natural powers of the mind?"</P>
<P>"Oh, yes, a great deal: And here, I acknow|ledge that Ellen has met my cares more than half way. She has a very good, but not an uncom|mon capacity. Her quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, however, is &s;omething more than common. She has a warm heart and a generous mind. I have been able to move her with the touch of a finger. Had &s;he had duller feelings, I mu&s;t have put my whole &s;trength to her."</P>
<P>"Your method of teaching &s;eems not only cal|culated to produce the immediate end, that of communicating the thing to be taught, but al&s;o to give an anticipated experience of life. Will there not be learnt by it, that yielding to the nece&s;&s;ity of things, which is the be&s;t &s;ecret for happine&s;s, and which enables us to repre&s;s u&s;ele&s;s repinings, and, when we cannot be happy one way, to be happy another?"</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="036127_0034_10084F63EB532FC0">"It is what I hope from it: and without &s;ome &s;uch end, all the teachings in the world are only calculated to de&s;troy the plea&s;ures of childhood, without having a tendency to promote the virtue or the happine&s;s of the man. I know not what may be Ellen's de&s;tiny: but I think I can dare to foretel, that if her pre&s;ent habits are allowed to &s;trengthen, and her pre&s;ent principles to take root, &s;he will never in any circum&s;tance, be the victim of ungoverned fancy, or the martyr to a &s;elfi&s;h &s;en&s;ibility."</P>
<P>"But is there not &s;ome danger in thus guarding her from a too great influence of the feelings, that &s;he &s;hould become le&s;s amiable by the want of them?"</P>
<P>"I do not guard her from feeling. I guard her from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. For others &s;he will feel acutely&mdash;for her&s;elf moderately: and where &s;elf is out of the que&s;tion, there is no fear but that rea&s;on will always be near enough to ward off any danger from too lively a &s;en&s;ibility."</P>
<P>"What is the leading feature of her mind? What is it that &s;he is extremely?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ellen knows no extremes."</P>
<P>"Except," interrupted mr. Thornton, "the extreme of good-humour."</P>
<P>"Were I to have made the exception," &s;aid mrs. Thornton, "it would have been that of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. But let us recollect that we are &s;peaking of a girl of twelve years old. She is yet really nothing. All the intimations that &s;he gives of character, are favourable. But, alas! how much &s;ix years of weak indulgence, or cold neglect, may make the woman of eighteen, differ from the girl of twelve!"</P>
<P>"She has neither the one nor the other to fear,"
<PB N="37" REF="036127_0035_10084F6577D4C150">
&s;aid mr. Mordaunt warmly, "if you will continue your cares."</P>
<P>"If I will!&mdash;"</P>
<P>"My obligations," interrupted mr. Mordaunt, "will then be &s;uch as can never be di&s;charged. And&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Talk not of obligations," &s;aid mr. Thornton. "be a&s;&s;ured they are reciprocal: and if you tru&s;t your Ellen with us another &s;ix years, they will all be on our &s;ide. Hitherto &s;he has only acquired the means of &s;elf improvement; from this time, every day will add &s;omething to the real improve|ment of her mind, and the formation of her heart: And do you not think, that tho&s;e who are to accompany the traveller in &s;o flowery a way, will be more than repaid for the fatigue of the journey?"</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was here interrupted by the breaking up of the ball: and Ellen &s;ideling to|wards her father, found her&s;elf a &s;eat upon half his chair.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, that from this evening mr. Mordaunt &s;pent many of his hours at the par&s;onage: Henry &s;pent &s;till more. With Ellen he &s;tudied, and with Ellen he idled. She was the better &s;cholar of the two; and would laugh at the carele&s;s manner in which he had been taught, would &s;coff at his want of application, and pique him to greater exertion by her ridicule. When books gave way to &s;ports, they walked, danced, or played at &s;huttlecock together; or Henry would a&s;&s;i&s;t Ellen and Mary in the labours of their garden; or they would compel him to li&s;ten to &s;ome of their botanical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, bo|tany being a new &s;tudy which mr. Thornton had ju&s;t given them. But as to che&s;s, which equally
<PB N="38" REF="036127_0036_10084F6C233E27E0">
excluded conver&s;ation and locomotion, Henry had never patience to hear it mentioned. For mu&s;ic he had little more toleration, except Ellen would &s;ing a ballad or play a country dance.</P>
<P>Six weeks were thus pa&s;&s;ed away: and mrs. Mordaunt had not yet fulfilled her promi&s;e of following her hu&s;band: he, therefore, thought it mo&s;t prudent to return into Hamp&s;hire, and not to quit it, 'till he brought her away with him. Henry's vacation was more than expired. He mu&s;t depart with his uncle; and Ellen declared, with as much na&iuml;vet&eacute; as truth, that &s;he knew not which &s;he was mo&s;t &s;orry to part with. She bade them farewel with a degree of pain which &s;he never before remembered to have felt. But &s;he had no lei&s;ure for artificial grief. It was rather the recollections that were forced upon her, than any &s;he indulged in, that &s;addened, for &s;ome days after their departure, both her le&s;&s;ons and her amu&s;ements. But a much more &s;erious grief awaited her.</P>

<P>ELLEN retained only an indi&s;tinct idea of the &s;everity and ill will of her mother towards her during her infancy. All remembrance of it had been, by the cares of mrs. Thornton, as much obliterated as po&s;&s;ible. Thus, though &s;he did not look forward to the arrival of mrs. Mordaunt with the &s;ame delight and de&s;ire which &s;he had felt when &s;he expected her father, &s;he neverthele&s;s thought of it with plea&s;ure: and the expectation of &s;eeing her &s;i&s;ters, filled her with hopes &s;till more &s;atisfactory to her feelings.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t evening &s;pent in their company re|pre&s;&s;ed this plea&s;ure, and chilled her hopes.</P>
<P>The immediate impul&s;e, on the &s;ight of her mother, had been to fly into her arms: but &s;he had &s;topped &s;hort, checked by the frigidity of her air, and the &s;cowling di&s;content of her brow. She waited for invitation,&mdash;but &s;he received it not: and &s;he &s;tood &s;ilent and depre&s;&s;ed, with her eyes ca&s;t upon the ground, uncon&s;cious what could have been her fault, yet feeling that &s;he mu&s;t have committed one.</P>
<P>"Maria," &s;aid mr. Mordaunt, "Ellen longs to embrace you."</P>
<P>"There, child," &s;aid Maria, coldly ki&s;&s;ing her forehead, "I hope you are grown good. But you u&s;ed to be the naughtie&s;t little brat I was ever ac|quainted
<PB N="40" REF="036127_0038_10084F70B0DAAB08">
with. Many are the twigs of birch I have worn out in your &s;ervice."</P>
<P>Tears &s;tarted into poor Ellen's eyes. She had nothing to &s;ay; nor did &s;he know clearly at that moment what &s;he thought. But &s;he felt that &s;he wi&s;hed her&s;elf away.</P>
<P>Her &s;i&s;ters had no ill will towards her; but &s;he was not an object of any intere&s;t in their eyes. Vitiated by their mother's precepts and example, they con&s;idered the having quitted the South of England, as having left every thing that was de|&s;irable in life&mdash;as the forfeiture of all their hopes of e&s;tabli&s;hment in the world&mdash;and, indeed, as the con&s;ummation of misfortune. Their journey, therefore, had been &s;pent in tears and regret. Groby Manor appeared to them as a pri&s;on, in which, for the future, their only happine&s;s mu&s;t ari&s;e from enumerating delights that were gone for ever, and in talking of per&s;ons who were to be &s;een no more. To all, of which Ellen could &s;peak, they were perfectly indifferent. They were too indolent to enter into her exerci&s;es, and too ignorant to care about her &s;tudies.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;en&s;ibly felt her di&s;appointment, a di&s;ap|pointment that every future day confirmed.</P>
<P>Her mother added ill humour and di&s;appro|bation to her coldne&s;s: and though it was no longer in her power to puni&s;h, or to control her, it was more than &s;ufficiently &s;o to mortify and to thwart her. There was no opportunity that occurred of doing either, that &s;he ever &s;uffered to e&s;cape. Her di&s;like to Ellen was, indeed, little, if at all, &s;hort of hatred. She could not conceal from her&s;elf how fal&s;e had been the character which, in her early years, &s;he had &s;ought to &s;tamp her with. Her under&s;tanding and temper, however, now
<PB N="41" REF="036127_0039_10084F7389BF1A18">
appeared both to be indubitably excellent: and mrs. Mordaunt was fully aware of the conclu&s;ion that mu&s;t be drawn by every body, that if &s;uch &s;oil had not from the fir&s;t produced fruit, it mu&s;t have been wholly owing to the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the cultivator. She therefore con&s;idered Ellen's merits and acquirements, as reproaches to her&s;elf, and as a mo&s;t &s;evere mortification to her vanity; and as &s;he could not, with all her depreciation of them, le&s;&s;en their real value; &s;he hated Ellen as the cau&s;e of her daily and hourly mortifi|cation.</P>
<P>It was more by the &s;elf indulgence of railing at Ellen, than from any fixed de&s;ign, that mrs. Mor|daunt communicated her prejudices to the hearts of her daughters. The&s;e prejudices were aided by the di&s;covery that they &s;oon made, that Ellen, though &s;o far &s;hort of them in years, was their &s;uperior in every kind of u&s;eful knowledge. They found &s;he every day grew into more con&s;ideration: and the ju&s;t preference that mr. Mordaunt gave her in his affections, though they did not by any effort towards imitating her excellencies endeavour to le&s;&s;en, filled them with the mo&s;t rancorous jea|lou&s;y. They &s;hrunk from all Ellen's playful and affectionate attempts towards being upon a fami|liar footing with them: and &s;he was &s;oon pain|fully convinced, that &s;he was to look for no friend|&s;hip from her &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>All mr. Mordaunt's efforts to e&s;tabli&s;h harmony and mutual love among the individuals of his fa|mily were in vain. It &s;oon came to be con&s;idered as compo&s;ed of two parties, of which mrs. Mor|daunt and her two elde&s;t daughters formed one, and mr. Mordaunt and Ellen the other. The boy
<PB N="42" REF="036127_0040_10084F770CD41A78">
he had re&s;olutely divided from his mother, and placed under the care of a friend of his own, from who&s;e a&s;&s;iduity he hoped he might derive advan|tages, that would, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, make up for the years that had been mi&s;pent.</P>
<P>"If," &s;aid he to mrs. Thornton, with a &s;igh of the bittere&s;t &s;elf-reproach, "if I am to do ju&s;tice to the under&s;tandings of my children, or to pre|&s;erve their hearts from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and vanity, it mu&s;t be by removing them from the influence of a woman whom I once imagined po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every virtue that adorns humanity."</P>
<P>"Ah, my dear friend," &s;aid mr. Thornton, "your mi&s;take is not an uncommon one. The fa&s;cination of beauty always has prevailed, and always will prevail. We can only render it harm|le&s;s, by giving to our females &s;uch educations as will place all the u&s;eful energies of the under&s;tand|ing, and all the virtuous propen&s;ities of the heart, in conjunction with per&s;onal charms. If this can be done, the whole of human kind will bene|fit."</P>
<P>Ellen di&s;appointed in the reciprocation of affec|tion and plea&s;ure which &s;he had hoped for from her own family, applied her&s;elf clo&s;er than ever to her le&s;&s;ons: and the kindne&s;s of mr. and mrs. Thornton, with the friend&s;hip of their daughter, &s;he found no inadequate compen&s;ation for the contrary &s;entiments that filled the bo&s;oms of her mother and &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>The following &s;ummer again brought Henry into Northumberland. He and Ellen met with mutual delight: and this delight increa&s;ed with every hour they pa&s;&s;ed together.</P>
<P>If Henry had been the companion and play-fellow
<PB N="43" REF="036127_0041_10084F7ACE0E6B50">
of Ellen, when fir&s;t they knew each other, he now became her friend. Ellen had already &s;orrows to di&s;burden. The invincible &s;ilence and apparent uncon&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of both mr. and mrs. Thornton, as to the conduct of her mother and &s;i&s;ters towards her, left Ellen at a lo&s;s to know whether it was perceived by them or no. But &s;uch re&s;erve on their part made appear the pro|priety of her continuing equally &s;ilent, and &s;eem|ingly uncon&s;cious. From a feeling of delicacy, &s;he was not more communicative to Mary.</P>
<P>But with Henry &s;he had no concealments. His quick &s;en&s;e had in&s;tantly revealed to him the unkindne&s;s of his aunt and cou&s;ins: and the warmth of his heart and temper led him to &s;peak of it to Ellen, in terms of hone&s;t indignation. Ellen was not angry; but &s;he was grieved. She lamented her own inability to conciliate the affec|tions of tho&s;e by whom &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed to be be|loved, and to love: and Henry being made &s;till more angry by &s;eeing her grief, declared them, in expre&s;s terms, to be unworthy of her &s;olicitude or regret.</P>
<P>Henry's partiality for Ellen, was an additional motive to her mother's hatred, and her &s;i&s;ters' jealou&s;y. Mrs. Mordaunt had hitherto boa&s;ted of her nephew as the ornament and pride of her <HI>own</HI> family: and &s;he could not but look upon it as a degradation to the dignity of that family, to &s;ee him give the mo&s;t unequivocal manife&s;tations of preferable attachment to that child of hers, who&s;e birth, &s;he &s;crupled not to declare, &s;he con&s;idered as her greate&s;t misfortune.</P>
<P>Henry, with &s;omething of a malicious archne&s;s, was &s;o far from concealing his partiality in com|pliment
<PB N="44" REF="036127_0042_10084F7C57E07CE0">
to his aunt, that he took every opportu|nity of di&s;playing it before her, and of magnify|ing the merits and acquirements of Ellen, be|yond all other merits and acquirements. He needed not this method for the confirmation of a pa&s;&s;ion that had taken deep root in his heart.</P>

<P>EVERY vacation, while Henry continued at &s;chool, and many days that were not vacation, when by his removal to college he became more his own ma&s;ter, were &s;pent by him, upon &s;ome pretence or other, at Groby Manor. Each time he &s;aw Ellen his attachment increa&s;ed, for each time &s;he appeared more amiable and charming in his eyes.</P>
<P>Perhaps the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;picious proof of a good education is, that the progre&s;s of time is marked by the progre&s;s of improvement in the pupil. Ellen gave this proof of the goodne&s;s of her education. Every &s;ix months &s;he had made &s;ome acqui&s;ition in knowledge, or gave &s;ome proof that her rea&s;on &s;trengthened, and that her pa&s;&s;ions were more under control. Good habits were converted into virtues; and warm affections ripened into bene|volence.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who be&s;tow the name of education on a de&s;ultory form of in&s;truction, often &s;u&s;pended through idlene&s;s, or broken in upon by frivolous and pernicious amu&s;ements, who&s;e efforts, weak as they are, are directed wholly to filling the head, rather than to forming the heart, or cultivating
<PB N="46" REF="036127_0044_10084F80E24B9A20">
the rea&s;on, cannot gue&s;s, and will not be made to believe, how much u&s;eful knowledge, how much vigour of mind, how much &s;trength of prin|ciple, may be produced by eleven years of wi&s;ely directed and unremitted attention to tho&s;e objects.</P>
<P>Ellen at &s;eventeen, with all the gaiety that belongs to that age, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great acutene&s;s of di&s;cernment, much power of rea&s;on, an invincible integrity, and a command over her pa&s;&s;ions, which is not often met with in the mo&s;t advanced years. Her mind was &s;tored with u&s;eful and ornamental learning. Her per&s;on was light and agile. She had the prettie&s;t hands and feet in the world. Her countenance was frank and intelligent: and her complexion clear and blooming. No one would have fallen in love with Ellen for her beauty; but, being in love with her, every one mu&s;t have thought her beautiful.</P>
<P>Henry could now &s;it whole hours with her at che&s;s, or hanging over the back of her chair. Any &s;ound that &s;he drew from her harp&s;ichord had power to rivet him to the &s;pot. Ellen could re|mark on the difference of his ta&s;te now and in former times: but &s;he was not con&s;cious of the change that had taken place in the nature of his attachment. Her's towards him, was lively and animated, as it had always been. But being ac|cu&s;tomed to love him only as her cou&s;in, &s;he thought &s;he loved him as her cou&s;in &s;till.</P>
<P>Henry, however, now twenty, was no &s;tranger to the nature of the pa&s;&s;ion which wholly occupied his mind; and being challenged upon it by his uncle, frankly declared that his hope and de&s;ign were to gain the heart of Ellen, and that, having gained it, no earthly con&s;ideration &s;hould make him forego the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="036127_0045_1008386A97870A70">"But your father?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"My father has no claims upon me but tho&s;e of nature. I am no elde&s;t &s;on, thank heaven. To me cannot be pleaded either the pride or the ava|rice of my family. I am de&s;tined to work out my own &s;upport; and by that de&s;tiny my inde|pendence is &s;ecured. Oh! my uncle, give me leave to try to gain the affections of Ellen. Do you ratify the gift, and my father neither will or can have any objection to our union."</P>
<P>"It is at lea&s;t fit you con&s;ult him before you attempt to gain a heart, which, even if gained, ought not, without his concurrence, and, I flatter my&s;elf, would not remain yours."</P>
<P>Oh! thought Henry, if I were once a&s;&s;ured of Ellen's heart, the way would be ea&s;y.</P>
<P>"Will you, &s;ir, explain my hopes and my wi&s;hes to my father? You know I have never attempted concealment. I have always thought I had a right, as one born to independence&mdash;the independence that indu&s;try gives&mdash;to indulge in a love which has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my heart from the fir&s;t weeks of my knowledge of Ellen, and which will never depart from it but with my late&s;t &s;igh."</P>
<P>"I love your frankne&s;s, and I love your ar|dour: but I mu&s;t tell you, you are mi&s;taken in your idea of independence. What are you, what can you be for many years to come, un&s;upported by your father? It is for him to &s;ay how you &s;hall exert your indu&s;try, what a&s;&s;i&s;tances he will give to it, and what returns he may expect from the &s;ucce&s;s of it, before you can con&s;ider your&s;elf as being, or pretend to act as, an independent per&s;on."</P>
<P>"But you, &s;ir," &s;aid Henry lowering his tone, "but you, &s;ir, could be favourable to my wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall be, I mu&s;t be, ruled by your father.
<PB N="48" REF="036127_0046_10084F89DAE4C018">
All I can give Ellen will be little; and I &s;hall never con&s;ent to her becoming the wife of any man again&s;t the con&s;ent of his parent."</P>
<P>Henry's hopes &s;eemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otter to the founda|tion. "What would you have me to do, &s;ir?" &s;aid he faintly. "I will put my&s;elf under your direction. I wi&s;h to con&s;ider you as my father."</P>
<P>"What I <HI>require</HI> from you is to quit Groby Manor. I would guard Ellen from all unnece&s;|&s;ary pain; and therefore if you are not to be united, I would &s;pare her the pang of a di&s;ap|pointed hope. At pre&s;ent, with all your in&s;i|nuating qualities, young man, I believe your heart is free."</P>
<P>"This is what you require of me," &s;aid Henry impatiently: "what is it that you advi&s;e?"</P>
<P>"That you open your mind fully to your father, and that you act implicitly as he &s;hall direct."</P>
<P>"And &s;uppo&s;e he forbids me to think any more of Ellen, do you &s;uppo&s;e I can obey him?"</P>
<P>"Indeed I do; becau&s;e you ought."</P>
<P>"And could you, &s;ir, at my age?"</P>
<P>"A&s;k me no que&s;tions. If you hope for my intere&s;t, you mu&s;t do what I require and advi&s;e."</P>
<P>"With &s;uch a bribe, what is it I would not do? I will be gone this very evening, nay, within this hour. If I were to &s;ee Ellen again, who knows but I might whi&s;per a &s;ecret in her ear, that might make her not unintere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;s of my journey."</P>
<P>"Go; and my good wi&s;hes go with you. If you can add per&s;everance to your activity, you may in time have the independence you talk
<PB N="49" REF="036127_0047_10084F8B63585ED0">
of; and I may have the plea&s;ure to receive you as my &s;on."</P>
<P>Henry pre&s;&s;ed his uncle's hand between both his in &s;peechle&s;s agitation, and ran off to conceal his falling tears.</P>
<P>Henry's journey was &s;peedy, and not wholly un&s;ucce&s;sful. Marriage, according to the deci|&s;ion of lord Villars, was to be put wholly out of the que&s;tion for &s;ome years: but Henry was al|lowed, upon tho&s;e terms, to endeavour to attach Ellen to him&s;elf: and lord Villars promi&s;ed, when his &s;on could prove to him that he was ma&s;ter of the annual &s;um of five hundred pounds, as the fruits of his own indu&s;try, that he &s;hould then be allowed to make her his wife. His profe&s;&s;ion was to be the law. Three hundred pounds a year lord Villars propo&s;ed to allow him; and he engaged to continue this &s;um 'till Henry by his own efforts made the five hundred pounds per annum eight.</P>
<P>Henry already thought him&s;elf the hu&s;band of Ellen; but lord Villars's views were very different. By removing the po&s;&s;ibility of a connexion, which it was not his de&s;ire &s;hould ever take place, to &s;o di&s;tant and uncertain a period, he depended upon the vici&s;&s;itude of human events, and the in&s;tability of human affections. He knew, much better than Henry, how long it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be be|fore he could perform his part of the engagement: and in the lap&s;e of &s;o many years, he made &s;ure of his calculation, that either the power to do &s;o, or the will, would be lo&s;t. He might indeed have refu&s;ed his con&s;ent altogether, but he had many rea&s;ons for not doing this. Although &s;teady and unbending as to the end he had in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iew, the means he always cho&s;e &s;hould be the
<PB N="50" REF="036127_0048_10084F8CF6475ED8">
gentle&s;t po&s;&s;ible. Experience had long confirmed him in the policy of &s;uch proceeding. If they &s;ucceeded at all, their &s;ucce&s;s was more complete than any which violence could produce: and if violence mu&s;t be re&s;orted to, it ever operated with double force for having been for &s;ome time withheld.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e he particularly attended to the cha|racter of Henry; the energy of who&s;e mind he knew would be up in arms again&s;t manife&s;t inju&s;|tice or manife&s;t unrea&s;onablene&s;s. It &s;uited nei|ther his family views, nor his intere&s;t to be at va|riance with a &s;on, who&s;e &s;uperiority of character he was willing to make the in&s;trument of family aggrandizement. He was not inattentive either to the advantage to be derived from curbing the pa&s;&s;ions and indi&s;cretions of a young man, or of the &s;pur that might be given to his indu&s;try, by the bait of a promi&s;ed marriage with the woman of his choice, as a reward for his virtue and his exertions. But in thus holding forth the &s;ugar|plumb for good behaviour, he by no means yielded the power of the rod which was &s;till to be exerci&s;ed, if after circum&s;tances made it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Henry comprehended nothing of all this. He relied equally on the good faith of his father and his own con&s;tancy; and thanking lord Villars for his indulgence with the mo&s;t enraptured gratitude, mea&s;ured back his &s;teps to Northumberland.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt thought lord Villars's deci&s;ion both wi&s;e and kind; and mo&s;t willingly gave Henry permi&s;&s;ion to gain the heart of Ellen, if he could.</P>
<P>In the character of Henry mr. Mordaunt &s;aw the &s;eeds of all tho&s;e qualities that he could wi&s;h for in a hu&s;band for his daughter. But, had he
<PB N="51" REF="036127_0049_10084F8E807A73A8">
been independent, and his wi&s;hes &s;anctioned by the approbation of lord Villars, mr. Mordaunt would not willingly have tru&s;ted, at the early and tempe&s;tuous age of twenty, the happine&s;s of Ellen to his care. His di&s;po&s;ition was too ardent, and his ta&s;te for plea&s;ure too eager, to have given a rea&s;onable hope, that having thus early attained the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes, the re&s;t of his life would be regulated by the dictates of rea&s;on, or even that the object which had &s;o ea&s;ily been obtained, however now highly prized, would be able to maintain its value in his e&s;timation. But in the di&s;cipline of a &s;even or eight years' &s;tudy of the law, with Ellen for his reward, mr. Mordaunt &s;aw a cour&s;e of education for Henry, that would, he doubted not, give &s;tability to all his virtues, and train him to that power of mind, and recti|tude of feeling, which would &s;ecure both her happine&s;s and his own.</P>
<P>All the&s;e arrangements were received by mrs. Mordaunt with a &s;ullen di&s;content. She &s;miled &s;cornfully at the idea of an engagement between a boy and a girl, the accompli&s;hment of which was not to take place until &s;o di&s;tant a period of time: and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a wonder that her brother would ever con&s;ent to &s;o fooli&s;h a contract. How|ever as the completion of it opened no views of &s;plendour or greatne&s;s to Ellen, &s;he took no trou|ble to oppo&s;e it, and contented her&s;elf with pro|phe&s;ying that it would all end ill.</P>
<P>Ellen, from the &s;implicity of her life, and the full occupation of her time, had perhaps thought le&s;s of love and matrimony than any girl of her age: but Henry was not the le&s;s dear to her for this. It is true, he made neither her &s;leeping or her waking dreams. She &s;lept each night &s;ound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d undi&s;turbed: and &s;he aro&s;e each morning gay
<PB N="52" REF="036127_0050_10084F884C442EB8">
and active. The day was not more tedious when Henry was away; but it was infinitely more de|lightful when he was there. His conver&s;ation had more charms for her than that of any other of her companions, but &s;he had no de&s;ire to enjoy his conver&s;ation apart. If things went on in their u&s;ual cour&s;e, Henry occurred &s;eldom to her mind: but if &s;he were more than ordinarily plea&s;ed, or more than ordinarily chagrined, "Oh, that my cou&s;in were here!" was the fir&s;t wi&s;h of her heart: Ellen heard the commendations of Henry with no &s;en&s;ation but that of a &s;imple acquie&s;cence in their truth. But where he was blamed, &s;he was &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e, and thought not &s;o much of vindicating him, as correcting a mi&s;take. Of his merits, as equivocal, &s;he her&s;elf never &s;poke, no more than of the light of the &s;un: they appeared equally uncontrovertible. Neither thought &s;he of denying or affirming that &s;he loved him. To love Henry &s;eemed to her as natural as loving her&s;elf. But had he never been allowed to return to Northum|berland, when he left it on his la&s;t vi&s;it to his fa|ther, however Ellen might have &s;en&s;ibly lamented the lo&s;s of her earlie&s;t friend and mo&s;t loved com|panion, her peace would have remained &s;ecure, and her heart unwounded.</P>
<P>Henry had hitherto been &s;atisfied with the kind of love Ellen had felt for him. But he now &s;ought to render it more decided and appropriate.</P>
<P>The change in his attentions had not before e&s;|caped her: and the change in his language was &s;till more &s;triking. This change did not, howe|ver, di&s;plea&s;e her; nor did it alarm her, till &s;he began to find &s;omething like it in her&s;elf. Ellen had been accu&s;tomed to think, nor could &s;he proceed long heedle&s;sly in any path. Little re|flection
<PB N="53" REF="036127_0051_1008386D75466D80">
upon circum&s;tances made her believe, that it was her duty to repre&s;s the too fervent ex|pre&s;&s;ions and intimations of Henry's regard, and to lead her&s;elf and him back to that calm &s;tate of friend&s;hip, when, however delighted to be toge|ther, they were indifferent whether it were with others or alone.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this little plan, &s;he avoided all tete-a-tete walks, all withdrawings from &s;oci|ety&punc; to pur&s;ue their &s;tudies or amu&s;ements toge|ther. Sometimes &s;he a&s;&s;umed an air of re&s;erve, when his heart was running over at his lips; and at others appeared not to under&s;tand what was &s;poken in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms.</P>
<P>Henry was in de&s;pair; for he did not find out that all the&s;e were &s;ymptoms the mo&s;t decided in his favour.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt amu&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ometimes with tho&s;e cares. As he had no objection to the hook &s;triking deep into the heart of Ellen, he &s;uffered her thus to play with the line 'till &s;he was completely entangled in it.</P>
<P>Having heard her one day re&s;olutely deaf to the earne&s;t &s;olicitation of Henry for a walk in the wood, and having &s;een him in con&s;equence walk off in a huff, while &s;he remained thoughtful and &s;ilent at her work,</P>
<P>"How comes this, Ellen?" &s;aid he, "It &s;eems as if Henry and you were not upon &s;uch good terms as formerly."</P>
<P>Ellen blu&s;hed.</P>
<P>"Or are you upon better?" &s;aid mr. Mordaunt archly. Ellen blu&s;hed a deeper die: and almo&s;t hiding her face in her handkerchief, &s;he replied
<PB N="54" REF="036127_0052_10084E5FF5209218">
faintly, "It might be po&s;&s;ible I might &s;ee too much of my cou&s;in."</P>
<P>"And do you think if there were danger that you might &s;ee <HI>too</HI> much of your cou&s;in, I &s;hould have &s;uffered you to have &s;een <HI>&s;o</HI> much?"</P>
<P>Ellen rai&s;ed her eyes ha&s;tily to her father; and as ha&s;tily let them fall again.</P>
<P>"Come, my dear Ellen, if I were your lover, I might perhaps enjoy your confu&s;ion: but as your father I mu&s;t relieve you from it. You may follow Henry into the wood; and whatever he may &s;ay to you there, be a&s;&s;ured he has mine and his father's &s;anction for."</P>
<P>The inexpre&s;&s;ible joy that filled the heart of Ellen at the&s;e words, fir&s;t told her how much &s;uch a &s;anction was nece&s;&s;ary to her happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Whether Ellen followed Henry into the wood, or whether &s;he waited for the explanation, till he followed her there, may be left to the deci&s;ion of every female who reads their &s;tory. But certain it is, that from this evening he had an allowed intere&s;t in her heart.</P>
<P>Like him, &s;he had a perfect reliance on his con&s;tancy, and his indu&s;try. But he did not &s;o fully agree with her, that their happine&s;s was likely to be more permanent from being e&s;tabli&s;hed on the grounds of prudence and forbearance, than if they were, maugre all &s;uch con&s;iderations, to begin it from that moment.</P>
<P>It mattered not, however, as to the effect, what was the opinion of either of them in this point. From the decree which had declared their marriage &s;hould not take place till Henry's application pro|duced him five hundred pounds a year, there lay no appeal.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="036127_0053_10084E619D5B3E58">Henry took chambers in Lincoln's Inn, and began his legal career with equal diligence and acutene&s;s. Every vacation he &s;pent at Groby Manor: and he was earne&s;t in di&s;playing, both to Ellen and her father, his habits of application and economy. Ellen relying upon his affection, and plea&s;ed with her pro&s;pects in life, had no jealou&s;ies to alarm, or anxieties to di&s;turb her. She pur&s;ued, uninterruptedly, her accu&s;tomed cour&s;e of &s;tudies and amu&s;ements: and as &s;he grew more her own mi&s;tre&s;s, and more independent, they were im|proved into plea&s;ures of the pure&s;t kind, by being enabled to render her benevolence more active, and by &s;uffering her attentions to take a wider range.</P>
<P>She had now nearly attained her nineteenth year; and &s;he had re&s;ided wholly at Groby Manor for the la&s;t twelve months. She continued, how|ever, to live much with mr. and mrs. Thornton, under who&s;e dearly-beloved roof many hours of every day were pa&s;&s;ed. Nor could any thing in|crea&s;e that affection which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between her, and its highly-valued inhabitants. The gratifica|tions of ta&s;te, and the feelings of the heart, formed the ties which bound them to each other: and the force of obligation, received and communi|cated, rendered them indi&s;&s;oluble.</P>

<P>IT was at this time that lord Villars invited his &s;i&s;ter and her whole family to his hou&s;e in Hamp|&s;hire. He had formed for his elde&s;t &s;on a ma|trimonial connection, with lady Almeria We&s;tern, an heire&s;s of a large fortune, to whom he was guardian. To bring this matter to the de&s;ired i&s;&s;ue, had co&s;t him much artifice and trouble: and the &s;ucce&s;s of his plans filled him with not le&s;s pride than plea&s;ure. The lady was &s;till very young: and as his &s;on had no attractions either of per&s;on or manner, he was eager to complete the marriage before her comparative powers would lead her to make &s;uch di&s;tinctions as might probably break it off for ever. As &s;he added a very competent &s;hare of beauty to the attractions of her thou&s;ands, it was not to be doubted, but that, if &s;he appeared in the world, mr. Villars would meet with many competitors: and lord Villars had none of that blind parental partiality that could conceal from him, in any degree, the

danger of &s;uch a competition. The marriage, it was therefore determined, &s;hould take place im|mediately. It was to be celebrated in the country; and lord Villars wi&s;hed, by making every circum|&s;tance relative to it as &s;plendid and dazzling as po&s;&s;ible, to per&s;uade the young bride that &s;he was an enviable and a happy woman.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt willingly accepted the invitation, both as an indulgence to his wife and his elder daughters, and from a de&s;ire to introduce Ellen to a more intimate knowledge than any &s;he had yet attained, of a family of which &s;he was &s;ome time to make one. Henry al&s;o was to leave the du&s;t and dullne&s;s of his chambers, upon this fe&s;|tive occa&s;ion: nor was there to be any one circum|&s;tance omitted that could contribute to the &s;atis|faction of any of the individuals who were to form the party to be a&s;&s;embled. Joy and happine&s;s were to pervade the whole.&mdash;But how vain are the plans of human wi&s;dom! The tritene&s;s of the ob&s;ervation is the proof of its truth.</P>
<P>Three days before the intended nuptials, the de&s;tined bridegroom was thrown from his hor&s;e; and received a hurt, that in thrice as many hours deprived him of life.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the degrees and variety of &s;orrow this event gave occa&s;ion for. Lady Villars wept as a tender mother. Her children were affected in a greater or le&s;s degree, according to their age and &s;en&s;ibility. Lady Al|meria was more &s;tunned than afflicted. Mrs. Mordaunt &s;aw, with grief, the path that this event opened to the exaltation of Ellen. Henry's un|feigned &s;orrow for the death of his brother was not unmixed with a tumultuous &s;en&s;ation, ari&s;ing
<PB N="58" REF="036127_0056_10084E7028088CE8">
from the change that had thereby ari&s;en in his own &s;ituation, and the uncertainty how that change might operate on the deare&s;t wi&s;hes of his heart.</P>
<P>The&s;e various emotions, however, were all within the bounds of moderation: but, to the grief and di&s;appointment of lord Villars there were no bounds. The &s;orrows of a parent on the death of a child appeared to be &s;acred and un|que&s;tionable; all hearts of common humanity &s;ympathized with lord Villars: but few, if any, &s;u&s;pected the &s;ource from whence the extremity of his affliction proceeded.&mdash;He had lo&s;t his &s;on: this lo&s;s might be &s;upplied. But with his &s;on he had lo&s;t the heire&s;s&mdash;that heire&s;s, by the fortunes of whom every branch of his family were to be benefited, on who&s;e property he had formed, in idea, a &s;uper&s;tructure of greatne&s;s and power, which could be realized by no other means, and the demolition of which filled him with the cruele&s;t pangs. There was indeed one way; but it was nearly hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>On Henry had devolved the rights and the titles of his brother, could he be prevailed upon to fulfil his engagements. Lord Villars had often wi&s;hed him in his brother's place. The &s;upe|riority of his character fitted him for the head of his family: but the decrees of nature could not be rever&s;ed: and lord Villars had endeavoured to per&s;uade him&s;elf, that wealth and rank might be&s;tow, even upon his elde&s;t &s;on, the con&s;equence that character had denied. They might how|ever now be united&mdash;they mu&s;t&mdash;they <HI>&s;hould</HI> be united. Lord Villars had taken his re&s;olution&punc; and it remained only to think of the means that might put it into force.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="036127_0057_10084E732C023858">The fir&s;t &s;tep was to break Henry's engagement with Ellen. But it was an act of &s;o violent and irritating a nature as to make almo&s;t hopele&s;s every con&s;equence that lord Villars wi&s;hed to follow from it. It was, however, a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep, and that without which nothing could be done. Lord Villars well knew the tender feelings of Henry: and though he was aware he &s;hould in vain at|tempt to overcome his &s;pirit, he was not without hopes that he might work upon his heart.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, the genuine &s;orrow that the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e of his di&s;appointment inflicted, was &s;uc|ceeded in lord Villars by a counterfeit affliction, in appearance as deep, as heart-breaking, and as incapable of con&s;olation as was ever felt by a parent for the lo&s;s of an only and highly be|loved offspring.</P>
<P>Henry &s;oon lo&s;t every other thought in com|mi&s;eration for his father, and in anxious endea|vours to con&s;ole him. But lord Villars was not to be con&s;oled. He could no longer endure to remain at a place, where he had been deprived of the hopes of his future life. He wi&s;hed to remove to a &s;maller hou&s;e that he had on the borders of the county: and he wi&s;hed only to have for his companions lady Villars, lady Almeria, mrs. Mor|daunt, and Henry. Of lady Almeria indeed he had become &s;o fond, that he could not bear her from his &s;ight. "She was the beloved of his lo&s;t &s;on: how could &s;he be otherwi&s;e than inex|pre&s;&s;ibly dear to him?"</P>
<P>For the de&s;ire of retaining mrs. Mordaunt he gave more genuine rea&s;ons. He knew there were no &s;chemes for the aggrandizement of her <HI>own</HI> family, (as &s;he always took care to denominate that of the Villars's) and for the mortification of
<PB N="60" REF="036127_0058_10084E7628C96FD0">
Ellen, that &s;he would not with equal avidity &s;eek to promote. He therefore &s;aid, with the mo&s;t perfect &s;incerity, "that from her company he hoped more, than from any other, toward &s;oothing his mind:" and he earne&s;tly intreated mr. Mor|daunt to leave her with him for a few weeks, promi&s;ing, at the end of that period, to bring her him&s;elf into Northumberland, where, with mr. Mordaunt's permi&s;&s;ion, he would &s;tay &s;ome time, as he hoped from the quiet and &s;eclu&s;ion in which he might there live, to regain more compo&s;ure and happine&s;s, than he could expect to derive from more bu&s;y and public &s;cenes."</P>
<P>It was not po&s;&s;ible for mr. Mordaunt to refu&s;e his con&s;ent to any part of what lord Villars pro|po&s;ed. But in &s;pite of his wi&s;h to repel all &s;u&s;|picion from his mind, there was &s;omething in lord Villars's conduct that excited very unea&s;y &s;en&s;a|tions, as to the rectitude of his future intentions.</P>
<P>Without his being able to fix on any one cir|cum&s;tance that could ju&s;tify his fears, mr. Mor|daunt was &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the apprehen&s;ion, that lord Villars's grief was a cover to de&s;igns inimical to the happine&s;s of Henry and Ellen. There appeared too much plan and arrangement in all he did, to proceed from a mind wholly im|mer&s;ed in grief, as he pretended his to be. The extravagant attachment that he profe&s;&s;ed to lady Almeria, the almo&s;t total neglect that he mani|fe&s;ted to Ellen, with the perfect &s;ilence he main|tained as to the engagements &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between her and Henry, and the excluding her from a party where &s;he would &s;o properly have made one, all contributed to &s;trengthen this apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lady Villars, who had become extremely fond of Ellen, had expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that &s;he might
<PB N="61" REF="036127_0059_10084E79937B5DA0">
continue with her: but this had been mentioned only once, and &s;eemed to be no more thought of. Henry, who had not &s;uppo&s;ed it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be intended &s;he &s;hould leave him, expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment and reluctance when he found it was &s;o de&s;igned: and he was told by mrs. Mor|daunt, that it was at the particular reque&s;t of mr. Mordaunt that Ellen was to go away.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;pired to oppre&s;s mr. Mordaunt's mind with very &s;erious fears. But he was withheld by delicacy and re&s;pect to the &s;orrow lord Villars di&s;played, from coming to any explanation upon the &s;ubject with him at this time. He knew the delay of a few weeks could be of no importance; and he was willing to hope, that by giving lord Villars more time for reflection, he might be led to &s;ee the inju&s;tice of any ha&s;ty de&s;ign, which the poignancy of his pre&s;ent di&s;ap|pointment might have &s;ugge&s;ted, of &s;eparating Henry and Ellen. He was al&s;o cautious not to betray any &s;u&s;picion that might &s;eem to &s;ugge&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a mea&s;ure being adopted, and &s;till more &s;o to avoid giving a &s;anction to &s;uch breach of faith, by &s;eeming to expect it. He contented him&s;elf therefore with &s;aying to lord Villars, that he &s;hould be truly glad to afford him every con&s;olation that he could derive from the retirement of Groby Manor, and the unwearied attentions of his family to every thing likely to contribute to his &s;atisfaction; and that Ellen, he was a&s;&s;ured, would think it as much her plea&s;ure as her duty to do all in her power to &s;upply the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>"We will talk farther of &s;uch things," &s;aid lord Villars ha&s;tily, "when I rejoin you in Northum|berland:
<PB N="62" REF="036127_0060_10084E82057988F8">
and it &s;hall not be long before I &s;hall do &s;o."</P>
<P>Divided between hope and fear, as to what were lord Villars's future plans, mr. Mordaunt returned, with his daughters, to Groby Manor. But to Ellen he communicated neither the one nor the other: and happily for the ea&s;e of her mind, no &s;u&s;picion &s;imilar to her father's, had found admittance there. Since the death of mr. Villars, &s;he had been wholly occupied with the feelings of others; and all thoughts of &s;elf had been lo&s;t in her &s;olicitude to admini&s;ter to the comfort of tho&s;e around her. The change that had taken place in the &s;ituation of Henry had been brought about by &s;o di&s;a&s;trous an event, that it never pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her mind under the form of plea&s;ure: but neither did it ever occur to her that a circum&s;tance that &s;ecured him an immediate &s;ituation in life, more affluent than that which he was to have attained by the flow progre&s;s of his per&s;onal efforts, could be the means of placing a barrier between them, who were &s;o certainly to have been united when tho&s;e efforts were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>She returned, however, &s;addened by the &s;cenes &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed, by her &s;eparation from Henry, and by &s;omething of an un&s;ettled notion, that though lady Villars was all kindne&s;s and affection, towards her, lord Villars had &s;hewn her more marks of neglect than regard.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LORD VILLARS and his family were now removed to the Grove; and Henry appeared &s;o a&s;&s;idious in his efforts to admini&s;ter comfort to his father, and &s;o &s;incerely touched with the con|tinuance of his grief, that lord Villars was led to believe he might &s;afely begin his operations.</P>
<P>One day, therefore, as they were alone toge|ther, lord Villars, as u&s;ual, apparently immer&s;ed in &s;orrow, and Henry, as u&s;ual, exerting all his faculties to rou&s;e and amu&s;e him. "My dear fa|ther," &s;aid he, with emotion, "it goes to my heart to &s;ee you thus overcome with a fruitle&s;s affliction. For my &s;ake, for the &s;ake of your fa|mily, endeavour to recover more power of mind."</P>
<P>"I am indeed overcome with affliction. But it is for the &s;ake of my family that I am thus over|whelmed."</P>
<P>"My dear &s;ir, we all know your paternal feel|ings. We all know the lo&s;s that&mdash;"</P>
<P>"No, Henry, it is not <HI>that:</HI> it is not any &s;elfi&s;h &s;orrow that overwhelms me. I could bear my own lo&s;s: but it is the ruin of my family, involved in that lo&s;s, which I deplore."</P>
<P>Henry &s;tarted. Thoughts ru&s;hed into his mind, which if they had ever found entrance there be|fore
<PB N="64" REF="036127_0062_10084E86B26B12F0">
he had repel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, as too affrontive to the ho|nour of his father, to be entertained for a mo|ment.</P>
<P>"The elde&s;t &s;on of a noble and not opulent family," continued lord Villars, "&s;tands in &s;o many relative &s;ituations, that his death, when his place cannot be fully &s;upplied by a &s;ucceeding brother, is no &s;ingle misfortune. It inflicts no &s;ingle wound. Every branch of that family, how|ever widely diverged, mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain an incurable evil."&mdash;</P>
<P>Henry was &s;ilent. He felt no inclination in him&s;elf to take his brother's place&mdash;to heal the&s;e wounds. Lord Villars went on.</P>
<P>"You know the princely fortunes that lady Almeria was to have brought to your brother: but you are mi&s;taken if you &s;uppo&s;e the advan|tages would all have been his. You, your bro|thers, your &s;i&s;ters, the whole innumerable tribe of you, would have felt the beneficial effects of her property through your lives, and perhaps be|yond the late&s;t period of them."</P>
<P>"My brother's death," &s;aid Henry coolly, "was very unfortunate both in its circum&s;tances and effects."</P>
<P>"In its circum&s;tances it certainly was. But it depends upon you to &s;ay whether it &s;hall be &s;o in its effects."</P>
<P>"Upon me, my lord," &s;aid Henry, affecting more &s;urpri&s;e than he felt.</P>
<P>"My dear &s;on, I have no rea&s;on to doubt the rectitude of your principles, or the tenderne&s;s of your heart. I can therefore have no doubt how you will act. But it is painful to me, that your duty and inclination &s;hould be, however little, divided."</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="036127_0063_10084E8CADE94BC0">"Divided, my lord! no, thank heaven, they are united, and united in &s;uch bonds as no power whatever can di&s;&s;olve."</P>
<P>"How you charm me, my deare&s;t &s;on! and how true it is that a wi&s;e &s;on maketh a glad father!"</P>
<P>Lord Villars was not accu&s;tomed to quote &s;cripture. Henry's heart was not the lighter for his doing &s;o upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>"It is nece&s;&s;ary, my lord, that we &s;hould un|der&s;tand each other. I pre&s;ume, that we both mean, that it is my duty to maintain engagements entered into voluntarily, and authori&s;ed by your &s;anction?"</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly, all &s;uch engagements as <HI>can</HI> be kept. But when a change of circum&s;tances has changed not only the nature of duties, but of po&s;&s;ibilities, engagements that cannot be fulfilled di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves. I am a&s;&s;ured that your own natural &s;en&s;e tells you that you cannot <HI>now</HI> marry Ellen."</P>
<P>"Not marry Ellen! What power &s;hall hinder me."</P>
<P>"The power of your own mind, &s;ir&mdash;the &s;en&s;e of right&mdash;the dread of my never-cea&s;ing abhorrence."</P>
<P>Henry writhed with agony.</P>
<P>"It is to your under&s;tanding, it is to your ju&s;|tice I appeal. Where is now that independence on which alone you grounded your right to choo&s;e for your&s;elf? Is it your own intere&s;t, or the inte|re&s;t of others, that in pur&s;uing that choice you would &s;acrifice? Had you, from the fir&s;t, been placed in the circum&s;tances you are now in, &s;hould you have dared to propo&s;e &s;uch a choice to me?
<PB N="66" REF="036127_0064_10084E8F93C6F530">
Do you believe me &s;ufficiently weak, or wicked, to have &s;anctioned &s;uch a choice? You are no longer the per&s;on you were when I did &s;anction it. You have no longer the &s;ame rights, the &s;ame duties. You mu&s;t no longer have the &s;ame conduct."</P>
<P>"Let me then," &s;aid Henry, with a new-born hope &s;pringing up in his &s;oul, and brightening his eye, "let me then re&s;ume that &s;tation, where only can my happine&s;s and my duty be reconciled. Let me again become a younger brother. To Frederic, with all my heart and &s;oul, will I make over all my rights of primogeniture&s;hip."</P>
<P>"It is not in your power, &s;ir. You cannot give him your title, unworthy as you are to retain it."</P>
<P>"And what is title without honour? You require me to give up the one, and yet are tena|cious of the other."</P>
<P>"I am jealous of both alike, &s;ir; and will not &s;ee either pro&s;tituted to the romantic fancy of a boy."</P>
<P>"You wrong my affection, my lord; indeed you wrong it. It is founded on rea&s;on and on virtue."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould be le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed at the warmth with which you pur&s;ue it," returned lord Villars, with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile, "if it were founded upon beauty. Your pa&s;&s;ion, Henry, wants the &s;tamp that will alone make it pa&s;s current in the world."</P>
<P>"Beauty! Ellen is an angel."</P>
<P>"Yet this angel of yours will have no objec|tion to becoming your wife, though &s;he bring you for her dowry <HI>ruin</HI> and a father's dete&s;tation."</P>
<P>"Oh! no, no, &s;he would reject, &s;he would renounce me for ever, rather&mdash;"</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="036127_0065_10084E93F6852F10">"And can you admire that rectitude of mind in her, which you refu&s;e to imitate? But I talk not of your ruin, &s;ir. After the degeneracy of mind that you have betrayed in this conver&s;ation, were you alone concerned, I would not trouble my&s;elf to with-hold you from it. But <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t not &s;o far forget <HI>my</HI> duties, whatever <HI>you</HI> do <HI>yours,</HI> as to &s;uffer you to involve in your de&s;truction the de&s;truction of a family. My hopes for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of you all, were placed on your brother's match with lady Almeria. You have &s;ucceeded to your brother's rights, and to his engagements: and, however unworthy of it, you have al&s;o &s;uc|ceeded to his place in lady Almeria's heart. She views you, ungrateful boy as you are, with but too favourable an eye. Upon you it depends to give wealth and happine&s;s, or poverty and wretch|edne&s;s, to your parents and to your family. We &s;hall &s;ee the kind of heart you have, by the elec|tion you make."</P>
<P>"The happine&s;s that derives wholly from wealth, and the wretchedne&s;s that is dependent alone upon poverty, are both, in my eyes too un&s;ub&s;tantial to de&s;erve any &s;acrifices&mdash;my lord, do with me as you will&mdash;but I will <HI>never</HI> be the hu&s;band of lady Almeria."</P>
<P>"And remember, peremptory &s;ir, that but under my heavie&s;t malediction &s;hall you ever be|come the hu&s;band of Ellen."</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BUT if the bo&s;om of lord Villars &s;eemed light|ened from a load of woe, that of Henry became in&s;upportably oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>However he might be rou&s;ed by the thought of ill treatment to a re&s;olute a&s;&s;ertion of his own rights, or however firmly his heart might be at|tached to Ellen, or his determination be unchange|ably fixed, never to abandon her, he could not be unmoved by the di&s;plea&s;ure of his father, or by the thought, that in a parent's eye he was the cau&s;e of unhappine&s;s to him&s;elf, or family. Nei|ther could he be in&s;en&s;ible of the truth of many of lord Villars's arguments, or uncon&s;cious that a marriage with Ellen, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, would be attended with many inconveniencies. But the thought that dwelt mo&s;t upon his mind, and the grief that pre&s;&s;ed the heavie&s;t upon his heart, aro&s;e from the probability that now this marriage would never take place. He believed he knew her too well to flatter him&s;elf that &s;he would become his wife again&s;t the expre&s;s prohi|bition of his father: and perhaps he prized her integrity too highly to wi&s;h that &s;he &s;hould do &s;o. But the &s;en&s;e of this integrity, the certainty of the virtues from which it aro&s;e, made the &s;uppo|&s;ition
<PB N="69" REF="036127_0067_10084E9D2A636CD8">
that he &s;hould never call her his, an agony that he knew not how to endure. He di&s;tracted him&s;elf with endeavouring to find out &s;ome middle way, that might reconcile his father's expectations and his own ideas of happine&s;s: but, wherever he turned, his dete&s;ted title, like Dejanira's fatal gift, &s;tuck clo&s;e, and filled him with torment and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>His father often returned to the attack, &s;ome|times with an appeal to his genero&s;ity and his rea|&s;on; and then was his re&s;olution mo&s;t in danger of yielding, and his heart torn with the extreme&s;t angui&s;h: &s;ometimes with the high tone of autho|rity, and the mo&s;t &s;evere denunciations of ever|la&s;ting di&s;plea&s;ure. Here Henry was invulnerable. When he was threatened, he became as the rock, which &s;eems but the more firmly fixed by the &s;torm that beats again&s;t it.</P>
<P>He knew, however, that if he did not yield, neither would his father; and that in any ca&s;e his happine&s;s, and in the former both his happi|ne&s;s and filial duty mu&s;t go to wreck. Of lady Almeria he thought little. Yet it was &s;ome ad|dition to his unhappine&s;s, to &s;ee evident marks of that partiality, with which his father had told him &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed him.</P>
<P>This was in part the work of mrs. Mordaunt; and it was the bu&s;ine&s;s in which lord Villars had from the fir&s;t engaged her.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria, even before the death of mr. Villars, had not been wholly in&s;en&s;ible to the difference which nature had made between the brothers. She had not been entirely without &s;ome wandering thoughts, that if Henry had been the elder brother, her de&s;tiny would have been the
<PB N="70" REF="036127_0068_10084E9EF626EE28">
happier. But &s;he was too young and too giddy to &s;uffer tho&s;e thoughts to &s;ink deep in her mind, had it not been for the artifices and management of mrs. Mordaunt, who in&s;inuated how generous it would be in lady Mary to turn her affections to Henry. She formed the hope, that he might re|turn tho&s;e affections: and it was by her &s;kill and care, that the &s;trength of his engagements with Ellen were concealed from lady Almeria. All tho&s;e were, however, unnece&s;&s;ary cares, and founded wholly upon the imperfect knowledge that had yet been attained of the di&s;po&s;ition of lady Mary.</P>
<P>Scarcely e&s;caped from the nur&s;ery, &s;he was little known; and &s;he had credit given her for infinitely more feeling and delicacy than &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. Of love &s;he was incapable: but having quick perceptions, and a tolerable power of di&s;|criminating characters, &s;he was well formed for taking &s;trong though tran&s;ient likings. And while &s;uch prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions la&s;ted, it would not have been any con&s;ideration, for the peace or honour of another, that would have with-held her from the gratification of them. Stimulated by the arts of mrs. Mordaunt, and moved by her own ta&s;te, &s;he had taken this kind of fancy to Henry; and pro|vided &s;he could in&s;pire him with the like, &s;he troubled her head little with the nature of tho&s;e engagements that had once &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and Ellen. It was not in Henry's nature to be rude or carele&s;s, e&s;pecially where a woman, and a young and pretty woman, was concerned. His addre&s;s, therefore, to lady Almeria, was gentle and obliging: and though &s;he would rather it had been impa&s;&s;ioned or gay, yet &s;he hoped both the&s;e modes were to come, when he had got over
<PB N="71" REF="036127_0069_10084EA334F46580">
the odd fancy, as &s;he called it, of grieving for the death of a brother, which had made him heir to a title and an e&s;tate of &s;even thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Henry, alike unable wholly to explain his di&s;tre&s;s, or wholly to conceal it from Ellen, wrote her letters that filled her with the cruelle&s;t di&s;quietude. She knew not how to &s;hape her fears; but every added line told her that &s;ome misfortune awaited her. Whether &s;he were to &s;uffer with or apart from Henry &s;he knew not. Whether &s;he were to be the &s;port of his incon|&s;tancy, or the victim of his prudence, &s;he was unable, from the tenor of his letters, to re&s;olve. Had &s;he been to have cho&s;en her fate, the deci&s;ion was ea&s;y. The re&s;ignation of Henry &s;he thought her&s;elf equal to: but under his depravity or un|kindne&s;s &s;he believed &s;he mu&s;t &s;ink.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of her mind, &s;he was as little able to expre&s;s her wi&s;hes and her fears with clearne&s;s, as was Henry him&s;elf. She called upon him again and again, to explain him&s;elf; while he, &s;ome|times, thinking he &s;aw a flexibility in his father that revived his hope, and &s;ometimes, from his increa&s;ed &s;everity, relap&s;ing into de&s;pair, alter|nately awakened the hopes and the fears of Ellen, without explaining to her his grounds for either.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt &s;aw the unea&s;ine&s;s of Ellen, and but too truly divined the cau&s;e. He forebore, however, to pre&s;s her upon the &s;ubject, and thought &s;he would frankly have opened her heart to him, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he had any thing certain to tell. She &s;hrunk from conver&s;ing with him on a my&s;tery that might involve the condemnation of Henry.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt wrote repeatedly both to lord Villars and mrs. Mordaunt, to remind them of
<PB N="72" REF="036127_0070_10084EA810B90950">
their promi&s;e, of joining him in Northumberland, but hitherto without receiving any &s;atisfactory an&s;wers. Lord Villars, however, beginning now to be convinced he had nothing to hope either from the ambition, the rea&s;on, or the obedience of Henry, re&s;olved to try his influence with Ellen, and by making her renounce his &s;on, render it a matter of indifference, as far as their engagements, whether his &s;on would renounce her or no. He determined therefore to &s;et out for Northumber|land. He wi&s;hed to conceal his intention from his &s;on: but Henry had too much at &s;take, to be ea&s;ily thrown off his guard, or lulled into a fal&s;e &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>He had con&s;idered, that while his father con|tinued in Hamp&s;hire, the conte&s;t lay wholly be|tween them; and that there was at lea&s;t a chance, that his ob&s;tinacy might out-tire that of his fa|ther's. While this was po&s;&s;ible, he forebore to explain him&s;elf to Ellen, unwilling to impre&s;s her mind with the painful &s;en&s;e of his father's inju&s;|tice, or to make a parade of his own con&s;tancy: but he was aware, that lord Villars's removal into Northumberland was with the de&s;ign of bringing the di&s;pute before another tribunal, and a tribunal where he knew the voice of love would plead in vain, were it once imagined to be oppo&s;ed by that of rea&s;on or of rectitude.</P>
<P>Not a moment, therefore, was to be lo&s;t, le&s;t Ellen might be intere&s;ted in the deci&s;ion, by an undue application to her genero&s;ity, or by a belief, though but a momentary one, that he could he&s;i|tate in his. He was therefore no &s;ooner convinced that lord Villars meant to begin his journey to Northumberland in a few days, than he di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger with the following letter&punc;</P>

<P>THIS letter was received by Ellen with a va|riety of emotions. She read in it a certainty of her misfortune; but &s;he read in it al&s;o an a&s;&s;urance of the con&s;tancy and genero&s;ity of Henry.&mdash; She acknowledged no right that could divide her from him; but &s;he trembled at the power, that, in adhering to him, &s;he knew &s;he mu&s;t oppo&s;e. &mdash;Her heart told her, there was no happine&s;s without Henry: and the &s;ource of rectitude &s;hewed her, that there was no e&s;cape from mi&s;ery in becoming his wife, under the prohibition of a parent.</P>
<P>She had now no rea&s;on for any re&s;erve to her father. She &s;hewed him Henry's letter, which, however, told him nothing but what his pene|tration had before di&s;covered.</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid he, "that lord Villars can be thus cruel and unju&s;t!"</P>
<P>"If he de&s;ign to appeal to me," &s;aid Ellen, "he mu&s;t mean to abide by my deci&s;ion."</P>
<P>"And your deci&s;ion, my Ellen.&mdash;What would be your deci&s;ion?"</P>
<P>"Alas! I know not. It is no broad path that
<PB N="76" REF="036127_0074_10084EB3B4B3E9B0">
lies before me: Intricate and &s;carcely to be made out by &s;uch a one as I, is the line of duty, that, if I could be &s;ure of, I hope I &s;hould pur&s;ue."</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt pre&s;&s;ed Ellen to his heart.</P>
<P>"Henry pleads his rights &s;trongly, they are indubitable, they cannot be cancelled by the man|date of ambition or avarice, though i&s;&s;ued by a parent. But to be the author of his ruin, and his filial di&s;obedience! Oh! my father, &s;uch deci|&s;ions are beyond my rea&s;oning faculties, they mu&s;t be decided by the impul&s;e of my heart, not, I hope, more firmly attached to Henry, than to virtue."</P>
<P>"Excellent creature!" &s;aid mr. Mordaunt: and Ellen felt her&s;elf encouraged by the prai&s;e.</P>
<P>"It may be generous and right, that Henry &s;hould refu&s;e to abandon me. It may be virtuous and nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould re&s;ign him."</P>
<P>Thus did poor Ellen endeavour to balance the rea&s;ons that made for and again&s;t her wi&s;hes. But &s;he bewildered her under&s;tanding without relieving her heart.</P>
<P>"I will &s;ee lord Villars. I will hear, (dan|gerous as it may be) I will hear Henry. If I mu&s;t lo&s;e him, he &s;hall not be torn from me: I will give him up. Oh! my father, if the &s;acrifice mu&s;t be made, allow me to make it."</P>
<P>"No other can make it. I abjure lord Vil|lars's &s;ophi&s;try. Having once authori&s;ed your engagements with Henry, I cannot recal my &s;anction. You are mi&s;tre&s;s of your fate. I am willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t your judgment: but I mu&s;t not control your will."</P>
<P>"My will?" &s;aid Ellen, &s;ighing, "alas! how little mu&s;t that be con&s;ulted in this debate."</P>
<P>Ellen pa&s;&s;ed three days in what might be called a labyrinth of thought, rather than a chain of rea|&s;oning.
<PB N="77" REF="036127_0075_10084EB542BB3FD0">
When, from what &s;he regarded as an evident principle of duty, "the &s;trict adherence to her engagements," &s;he had drawn conclu&s;ions the mo&s;t favourable to her happine&s;s, her deduc|tions were cro&s;&s;ed by a principle as evident, as that of the obedience of children to their parents, and all her rea&s;oning thrown into confu&s;ion. Again &s;he began; and again &s;he found her&s;elf conducted to a certain point; and, again con|fu&s;ed and bewildered, &s;he found &s;he had lo&s;t her way.</P>
<P>From &s;uch a maze of contrary obligations, &s;he knew not how to extricate her&s;elf. Yet &s;he lo&s;t not hope, while &s;he perceived that which ever way &s;he turned, wherever &s;he directed her view, <HI>the wi&s;h to do right</HI> &s;till appeared, as a beacon on a di&s;tant hill, pointing out the coa&s;t to which &s;he meant to direct her cour&s;e.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible, except where the mind was wholly given up to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, or re&s;entment, to live with Ellen without loving her. The evenne&s;s of her temper, her promptitude in obliging, mu&s;t &s;ubdue all le&s;&s;er prejudices. This had been the ca&s;e with her &s;i&s;ters; though their early e&s;trange|ment from her, and the difference that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in their manner of thinking, forbade any of that tender intere&s;t and interchangement of &s;entiments in which true friend&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts; they now loved her full as well as mo&s;t reputed friends love each other: and now that pity was added to their affec|tion, they felt and &s;hewed for her a &s;olicitude, that neither they nor her&s;elf had before thought them capable of.</P>
<P>Charlotte, in particular, was much moved by the evident di&s;tre&s;s of Ellen's mind, and the calm|ne&s;s
<PB N="78" REF="036127_0076_10084EB7DAC4DC08">
with which &s;he endured it. She thought there was &s;omething heroic in &s;uch compo&s;ure, under &s;uch circum&s;tances; and &s;he exerted all her abilities to con&s;ole and &s;upport her. But, however Ellen was &s;oothed by her &s;ympathy, &s;he could not be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her coun&s;el. Charlotte could &s;ee the matter only in one light. She ex|patiated on the inju&s;tice of lord Villars, on the merit of con&s;tancy, and the obligation of main|taining an engagement: and when Ellen pre&s;&s;ed her with the que&s;tion, "Would you, Charlotte, be the wife of any man, who, in forming his ties with you, mu&s;t break all tho&s;e that bind him to his family, and incur the everla&s;ting re&s;entment of his parent?" Charlotte could only reply, lord Villars had no right to be di&s;plea&s;ed; and that the peace of Henry ought to be dearer to her than that of all his family be&s;ide.</P>
<P>"But the peace of Henry," &s;aid Ellen, "is involved in the religious performance of his duty as a &s;on."</P>
<P>"No," Charlotte would reply, "&s;uch conduct as lord Villars holds, di&s;&s;olves the bonds of filial duty. You ought to &s;et him at defiance, and be happy in the love of each other."</P>
<P>Ellen would have been glad to have thought &s;o too: but in a mind as free from the prejudices of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s as her's was, things are not &s;een as they are wi&s;hed to be, but as they are.</P>
<P>On the evening of the third day, Charlotte and Ellen were walking in the wood, wholly engro&s;&s;ed with this one &s;ubject, when, as they were return|ing to the hou&s;e, they were &s;uddenly met by Henry.</P>
<P>"We are once more together, my Ellen," cried he, &s;natching her to his heart: "and no power on earth &s;hall part us."</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="036127_0077_10084EBAD92ACB78">Ellen, who had been engaged rather in debating whether &s;he &s;hould choo&s;e misfortune, than in de|ploring it as already felt, had, &s;ince the receipt of Henry's la&s;t letter, been more depre&s;&s;ed, than agitated. But his &s;udden appearance, and the vehemence of his addre&s;s, communicated in a moment to her bo&s;om all the emotion with which his own was convul&s;ed. Sinking from his arms, rather than being able to try to di&s;engage her&s;elf from them, "We are indeed together," &s;aid &s;he: "but, alas! upon what terms?"</P>
<P>"Upon terms that heaven and earth mu&s;t ap|prove&mdash;Upon terms that give me a right to &s;ay I will never re&s;ign you."</P>
<P>"Oh! be le&s;s vehement!" cried &s;he, and re&s;ting wholly upon Charlotte, her convul&s;ive &s;obs gave Henry the mo&s;t lively alarm. Never had he &s;een di&s;tre&s;s in this form. Never had he before &s;een the countenance of Ellen disfigured by the violence of any pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Why not re&s;t in my arms? Why not weep in my bo&s;om?" cried he mildly, "am not I your hu&s;band? Oh Ellen, is it po&s;&s;ible you can have decided again&s;t me?"</P>
<P>"No! no! no!" &s;aid &s;he. Charlotte unable to &s;upport her, yielded her to the impa&s;&s;ioned Henry, who, holding her in his arms, &s;at down with her on the gra&s;s. Tears relieved the almo&s;t bur&s;ting heart of Ellen. She &s;uffered them for &s;ome time to flow as &s;he hid her face on Henry's &s;houlder: then rou&s;ing her&s;elf, "I am better," &s;aid &s;he; "let us return to the hou&s;e: and, my dear Henry, if you would have me able to act as you wi&s;h, you mu&s;t not thus di&s;tre&s;s me."</P>
<P>"Deare&s;t Ellen, forgive me. I will be all calmne&s;s, all rea&s;on."</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="036127_0078_10084EBDC3375958">Ellen with difficulty moved along: but growing every moment more compo&s;ed, the emotion that the &s;udden appearance of Henry had given her, taught her the more to fear the power of her feel|ings, and to arm her&s;elf with double re&s;olution again&s;t being governed by them.</P>
<P>As they approached the hou&s;e, they were met ha&s;tily by mr. Mordaunt.</P>
<P>"Do you know who is arrived?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"My father," cried Henry: "how nearly has he eluded my vigilance!"</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid Ellen to her&s;elf, is the moment of trial come. Lord Villars appeared. Henry &s;aw the pallid cheek of Ellen and the whitene&s;s of her lips.</P>
<P>"My Ellen," cried he, "do not de&s;ert your|&s;elf; do not de&s;ert me."</P>
<P>"Oh, heaven direct me," &s;aid Ellen.</P>
<P>"Heaven does direct you. Heaven dictates what you ought to do. Heaven cannot approve of violated vows."</P>
<P>"Nor of di&s;obedience!" &s;aid lord Villars &s;ternly.</P>
<P>"Forbear," &s;aid Ellen to Henry, ("my lord.")</P>
<P>"Forgive my interruption, madam. To you I mean no har&s;hne&s;s. To the rectitude of your mind I know I may appeal, from the ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion of that intemperate young man."</P>
<P>"Temperance were treachery in this ca&s;e. My lord, I &s;ee your de&s;ign. You mean to tamper with the virtues of Ellen. You mean to &s;ubdue her con&s;tancy by her genero&s;ity&mdash;but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I am above di&s;gui&s;e, &s;ir. I do mean to prove the virtue you have &s;o vaunted. It is you who have &s;aid, that Ellen would renounce you for ever, rather than accept you at the price of your di&s;|obedience."</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="036127_0079_10084EC130296FF0">"Heavens and earth!" exclaimed Henry.</P>
<P>"And mo&s;t truly have you &s;aid, my Henry," interrupted Ellen; "and mo&s;t &s;incerely do I thank you for it."</P>
<P>"I never &s;aid &s;o; or, if I did&mdash;Oh! Ellen, do not undo both your&s;elf and me."</P>
<P>"My lord," &s;aid mr. Mordaunt, "you are too precipitate. Ellen ought not to be, &s;he <HI>&s;hall</HI> not be &s;o per&s;ecuted. You have nothing to fear, nothing that you ought to fear from her coole&s;t deliberation; and it is only the coole&s;t delibera|tion that ought to decide in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this."</P>
<P>And yet, thought Ellen to her&s;elf, the deci&s;ion is made. What but <HI>one</HI> thing can I do?</P>
<P>"I meant not to be thus precipitate. I meant not now to enter upon the &s;ubject: but the daring impatience of that unworthy boy&mdash; My dear madam," turning to Ellen, "I know and revere your virtues. It is from them I hope the &s;alvation of my family. Pray take my arm: let me &s;upport you."</P>
<P>"My lord, I want no &s;upport."</P>
<P>"Yes, my Ellen, you do. You want the &s;up|port of a parent," &s;aid mr. Mordaunt: "take my arm."</P>
<P>"Thank you, &s;ir," &s;aid Ellen faintly, and almo&s;t overcome: and re&s;ting on her father's arm, &s;he reached the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Here &s;he found mrs. Mordaunt, who greeted her with her u&s;ual coldne&s;s: but &s;eeing her agi|tation &s;aid: "Yes, yes, I knew it would come to this. I always foretold this. I always &s;aid that the intere&s;ts of a whole family were not to be &s;a|crificed to the fooli&s;h fancy of a boy and girl, who knew not what was good for them."</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="036127_0080_10084EC5271D3AB8">"Dear mamma!" &s;aid Charlotte.</P>
<P>"No harm, ma'am," &s;aid Ellen mildly, "&s;hall happen to any body, through my means, if I can prevent it."</P>
<P>"Retire, my dear," &s;aid mr. Mordaunt. "I am &s;ure you wi&s;h to be in your own room."</P>
<P>Ellen moved towards the door. But Henry, who had hitherto kept a gloomy &s;ilence, now ru&s;hed forward, "You do not go, Ellen, you do not go, without &s;uffering me to &s;peak to you, without hearing what I have to &s;ay?"</P>
<P>"She knows you have nothing to &s;ay," interrupted lord Villars, "that &s;he ought to hear. Ellen is indeed the excellent per&s;on you have always de&s;cribed her, the exemplar of her &s;ex."</P>
<P>"Henry has a right to be heard, my lord; and I mean to hear him. Nor have I more inclination than I have power to refu&s;e him."</P>
<P>"My kind, my beloved Ellen!"</P>
<P>Ellen held out her hand to him, "Oh!" &s;aid &s;he, in a low voice, "that I could be as much the one as I believe I am the other!" Then &s;peaking aloud, "At eight to-morrow morning I will &s;ee you alone: at pre&s;ent I beg I may be allowed to retire."</P>
<P>Lord Villars who believed he &s;aw the de&s;truc|tion of his hopes in the &s;everity of her air towards him, and her kind indulgence to his &s;on, &s;tood thunder&s;truck and confounded; while the wretched Henry, who argued the contrary but too ju&s;tly, even from her very kindne&s;s, &s;unk &s;piritle&s;s into a chair, while the warm blood for&s;ook his cheek, and every limb quivered with agitation. Lord Villars endeavoured by a long detail of the circum|&s;tances of his family, to convince mr. Mordaunt's
<PB N="38" REF="036127_0081_10084EC6B3C5FB88">
rea&s;on of the nece&s;&s;ity of the conduct he held, and by artful prai&s;es of Ellen to &s;ooth the indig|nity offered to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt di&s;dained to reply to his rea|&s;onings, or to thank him for his commendations. He a&s;&s;ured him, that it was neither the wi&s;h of his daughter, or him&s;elf, that &s;he &s;hould enter into his family without his approbation.</P>
<P>"But, my lord," &s;aid he, "you have in my opinion, by your former &s;anction to the affections of your &s;on, put it out of your power now to with-hold your con&s;ent to his marriage. All you have a right to do, is to endeavour to convince both him and my daughter, of the inconvenience that now attends it, and to induce them, if po&s;|&s;ible, by the weight of your rea&s;ons, to re&s;ign rights, which nothing but the mo&s;t apparent in|ju&s;tice can with-hold."</P>
<P>Lord Villars was &s;tung to the quick by the cold contempt of mr. Mordaunt.</P>
<P>"I am then to undo my whole family for a punctilio? Mine was only a conditional con&s;ent. It <HI>could</HI> only be a conditional con&s;ent. It was my <HI>&s;econd</HI> &s;on that I would have allowed to have mar|ried your daughter. No one would have dared to have a&s;ked me for my fir&s;t."</P>
<P>"Nor do I a&s;k you now, my lord. But if you have made a bad bargain, common hone&s;ty re|quires you &s;hould &s;tand to it, except tho&s;e with whom you have made it, will generou&s;ly relea&s;e you."</P>
<P>"Would you then," &s;aid mrs. Mordaunt (pa&s;|&s;ionately) "would you have an ancient and noble family fall into ruin, rather than thwart the mo|mentary fancy of a fooli&s;h girl and an ob&s;tinate boy? Rather be all the engagements that have
<PB N="84" REF="036127_0082_10084EC941151980">
been made &s;ince the days of Adam broken, than that &s;uch a con&s;equence &s;hould be incurred."</P>
<P>"Ellen would bring ruin into no family. I have, however, &s;aid, that I think &s;he and Henry are the only proper umpires in this di&s;pute: and I could wi&s;h a &s;ubject to be dropped, upon which if I &s;peak at all, I mu&s;t &s;peak very har&s;h truths."</P>
<P>"I would endeavour," &s;aid lord Villars, with an air as if he were to be a &s;ufferer for con&s;cience &s;ake, "I would endeavour to get over the &s;cru|ples of my mind, in allowing one unworthy child to take his own way to ruin, which it &s;eems with &s;ome people would much exalt my character. But when the intere&s;ts of my other dear and innocent children are involved in his folly, however my name may be branded, I will adhere to what I know to be right: and though I may be unable to prevent this act of madne&s;s, I will never have to reproach my&s;elf with having con&s;ented to it."</P>
<P>"Your lord&s;hip may re&s;t perfectly at ea&s;e both as to your con&s;cience, and the part Ellen will take. However either &s;he or my&s;elf may wi&s;h her the wife of your &s;on, we can have no de&s;ire that &s;he &s;hould become your daughter."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee, however," &s;aid lord Villars in a pa&s;&s;ion, "I &s;ee that &s;he de&s;igns it; but at her peril let her pur&s;ue the de&s;ign. Poverty while I live, and my eternal cur&s;e when I come to die, &s;hall &s;adden her days and torment her mind."</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt aro&s;e, "I leave you, my lord: and I would leave you under the mi&s;take that &s;o unworthily afflicts you: but when you find your|&s;elf ma&s;ter of your wi&s;hes, you &s;hall not have cau&s;e to think that you owe the completion of them either to the duplicity or the vehemence of your conduct. I know Ellen perfectly well; and I

will &s;take my life, that in the pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances &s;he will <HI>never</HI> marry your &s;on."</P>
<P>Lord Villars, on an a&s;&s;urance &s;o agreeable to him, felt all his anger &s;ub&s;ide in a moment. He did not wi&s;h to quarrel with mr. Mordaunt; &s;o, catching his hand, he cried, "My dear brother, forgive me; forgive the effu&s;ions of a father's &s;olicitude for a large family, who&s;e well being in the world depends upon the i&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. How willingly would I make any &s;acri|fice &s;hort of the intere&s;t of this family, for the happine&s;s of being &s;till more clo&s;ely united with you!"</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt withdrew his hand.</P>
<P>"You will give me leave to retire, my lord. It is not po&s;&s;ible to form any judgment but one on the events that have pa&s;&s;ed: and the con&s;e|quences of that judgment mu&s;t be, that all inter|cour&s;e between us henceforward mu&s;t cea&s;e."</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt withdrew; and left lord Villars and his &s;i&s;ter to rail and to rejoice; for after what mr. Mordaunt had &s;aid, they neither of them entertained any apprehen&s;ion but that Ellen would break her engagement with Henry.</P>

<P>HENRY had not been pre&s;ent at the conver&s;a|tion that had pa&s;&s;ed between his father and mr. Mordaunt. As &s;oon as he had recovered from the emotion into which the la&s;t words of Ellen had thrown him, he had withdrawn to the par&s;onage, there to pour out his griefs to the commi&s;erating mr. and mrs. Thornton. They, while they en|deavoured, by the &s;ofte&s;t arts of pity, to admini&s;ter &s;ome balm to his wounds, &s;ought to in&s;pire him with fortitude to &s;upport the con&s;ummation of his misfortune, which, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances they con&s;idered as inevitable.</P>
<P>Ellen pa&s;&s;ed the night in endeavouring to &s;trengthen her&s;elf in the re&s;olution, which &s;he &s;aw was the only one &s;he could now adopt with|out incurring the reproaches of her own heart, and involving Henry in di&s;obedience and ruin. But &s;he dreaded his vehemence: and though &s;he per|&s;uaded her&s;elf, that <HI>that</HI> alone would not be able to overpower her judgment, grounded, as it was, upon the be&s;t rea&s;oning &s;he was able to command;
<PB N="87" REF="036127_0085_10084ED36D86EC28">
yet &s;he &s;hrunk from the conte&s;t: and had &s;he not had more compa&s;&s;ion for him than for her&s;elf, &s;he would have explained her&s;elf in writing, and &s;pared them both the pangs of a fruitle&s;s alterca|tion. But to comply with his wi&s;hes in every thing that militated not again&s;t his duty, &s;he thought the mo&s;t &s;acred of her own: and &s;he kept the appointment made the preceding night.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he ca&s;t her eyes upon him, &s;he &s;aw, that the trial that awaited her was of a dif|ferent kind from the one for which &s;he had been preparing her&s;elf. All animation was fled from his countenance. A &s;ettled de&s;pair had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his features: and as he approached her, the tears fell in large drops from his eyes.</P>
<P>"Dear Henry!" &s;aid &s;he, holding out her hand to him. He took it; and pre&s;&s;ed it clo&s;ely to his lips.</P>
<P>"So kind, and yet &s;o determined! I do not complain, Ellen. But &s;urely I ought not to have been condemned unheard."</P>
<P>"Unheard! am I not here for the purpo&s;e of li&s;tening to all you have to &s;ay?"</P>
<P>"Yet my father tells me, I have nothing to hope."</P>
<P>"Do not believe lord Villars rather than me. &mdash;You have every thing to hope that, in your unprejudiced rea&s;on, you would wi&s;h to hope. I think I may venture to promi&s;e you &s;hall decide for me."</P>
<P>"Oh! that I might! then &s;hould I never quit this dear hand till you had promi&s;ed to pledge your faith with it at the altar."</P>
<P>"Would you then brave your father's di&s;plea|&s;ure? Would you be content to live in perpetual
<PB N="88" REF="036127_0086_10084ED4F442B920">
enmity with him? Would you entail di&s;tre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and poverty on your family?"</P>
<P>"Oh! no, no.&mdash;My father would with|draw his objections. Ju&s;tice, rea&s;on, would com|pel him to withdraw them. My family &s;hall never receive injury from me. I have offered to dive&s;t my&s;elf of my birthright, to re&s;ume the &s;tation which Ellen's love might be allowed to ble&s;s. I have been told I cannot dive&s;t my&s;elf of my title, and that that title mu&s;t be &s;upported by riches; that the fortune I may obtain by marriage, mu&s;t be &s;uch as will provide for my numerous brothers and &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion will other|wi&s;e reduce the family e&s;tate below the decorous appendage of a title. I am reminded, that &s;uch have ever been the known family views; and that I acknowledged the force of them, when I pleaded my being a &s;econd &s;on, as an unan&s;werable rea&s;on why I might be allowed to choo&s;e for my&s;elf. However my heart or my under&s;tanding may re|volt from &s;uch rea&s;onings, I mean not to combat them; I mean to act, as if convinced of their truth, and their rectitude: and had I not had rea&s;on to believe the cau&s;e already prejudged, I had a propo&s;al to have made to you, that, I per&s;uaded my&s;elf, might have reconciled duty and inclina|tion, have &s;atisfied my father, and made us hap|py."</P>
<P>Ellen's heart fluttered with revived hope.</P>
<P>"And what is your propo&s;al? Be a&s;&s;ured there is no prejudgment. Only &s;hew me how I can be yours, without violating the immutable obligation of obedience to a parent, and you will not be more ready to propo&s;e, than I &s;hall be to com|ply."</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="036127_0087_10084ED86F1EA710">"My propo&s;al." &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&punc; &s;till &s;peaking faintly, "is grounded on the knowledge I believed I had of your heart, on its total freedom from any wi&s;h for &s;plendor, for &s;hew, &mdash;"</P>
<P>"Name them not. Reconcile my duty and my love; and your ta&s;k is over."</P>
<P>"Deare&s;t creature, how could I for a moment &s;u&s;pect that love? How could I for a moment believe it le&s;s pure than my own."</P>
<P>"And did you? Could you?"</P>
<P>"You are calumniated, my Ellen. I have been taught to fear, that, awed by my father's threats of everla&s;ting di&s;plea&s;ure, you &s;hrunk from a marriage, which, under that di&s;plea&s;ure, would be a &s;ource only of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s to you."</P>
<P>"How am I be&s;et on all &s;ides! How allured by inclination, how &s;timulated by re&s;entment to quit the rugged path of duty. Support my rec|titude, my dear Henry, by your own: and make me no propo&s;al that is not warranted by the &s;anc|tion of virtue.</P>
<P>"What I propo&s;e is this: that I &s;hall pur&s;ue the line of life marked out for me before the un|fortunate death of my brother; that the annual difference there will be between the allowance my father will make me as an inmate of Lincoln's-Inn, and that which I ought to have as his elde&s;t &s;on, &s;hall accumulate, and be con&s;idered as a fund upon which I &s;hall draw for your fortune; that I &s;hall not claim your hand but upon the condition that it was fir&s;t promi&s;ed me. While my father lives, the &s;plendor of the family will be &s;upported by him. When he dies, though it mu&s;t &s;uffer a temporary eclip&s;e, it will be in no danger of being annihilated.&mdash;No wonder," &s;aid Henry, interrupt|ing
<PB N="90" REF="036127_0088_10084EDB5CECC130">
him&s;elf, "that you &s;mile. I almo&s;t di&s;dain to dwell upon &s;uch con&s;iderations. But if there is no preaching people into rea&s;on, it is well, for the &s;ake of peace, to accommodate our&s;elves as well as we can to their folly. As I have no hope, that the &s;avings I have propo&s;ed to be made from my annual allowance will be con&s;idered as &s;atis|factory to the wants and the wi&s;hes of the family, I further propo&s;e, that in the event of my coming to the e&s;tate, &s;uch a part of it &s;hall be appropriated to the u&s;e of my brothers and &s;i&s;ters, as, in &s;ome given number of years, may make up the &s;um that my father has fixed in his own mind as a proper fortune to be brought into the family by his elde&s;t &s;on's wife. At the end of this time, I &s;hall re&s;ume the whole of the e&s;tate, and the name of Villars recover its lu&s;tre. Thus no injury will be done to the younger branches of the fa|mily; you, my Ellen, will, after all, be a for|tune: the family &s;plendor will be untarni&s;hed: and all this will be purcha&s;ed on our part, by a few years of ob&s;curity and happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Though Ellen had a rectitude of principle and under&s;tanding, that made her perfectly compre|hend, and re&s;olutely adhere to that plaine&s;t of nature's dictates, the obedience due to a parent, &s;he was too young and too noble-hearted to cal|culate the inconveniences of a narrow income, or to have &s;uffered them to have influenced her deci&s;ion, if &s;he had calculated them, while they could reach only her&s;elf and him, who, &s;he doubted not, would have con&s;idered the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her hand as a full compen&s;ation. Her heart beat quick at this propo&s;al of Henry's. Her eyes &s;parkled with plea&s;ure. "And what &s;ays your
<PB N="91" REF="036127_0089_10084EDF61F30A40">
father to this plan?" cried &s;he, trembling with the eagerne&s;s of hope.</P>
<P>"What &s;ays he! What can he &s;ay? Has he any right to object?"</P>
<P>"But <HI>does</HI> he object?" &s;aid Ellen, with a voice &s;carcely articulate.</P>
<P>"Deare&s;t Ellen, will you hazard nothing for me? When every claim of ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied, are we to be undone for a punctilio?"</P>
<P>"Your father does <HI>not</HI> then approve your plan?"</P>
<P>"But he will approve it. He will be com|pelled to approve it. All the world will unite in his condemnation, if he does not."</P>
<P>"When he <HI>does</HI> approve, be a&s;&s;ured of my mo&s;t cheerful, my mo&s;t delighted concurrence."</P>
<P>"And without that approbation, you will do nothing for me?"</P>
<P>"Alas! what <HI>can</HI> I do? Had it been only ju&s;tice that was to have been &s;atisfied, &s;hould we ever have been in any danger of being &s;eparated? Will this plan of yours at all avert your father's di&s;plea&s;ure? Will it &s;ave you from di&s;obedience, or from the effects of it? Will you not have a parent's enmity to deprecate? And without the concurrence of lord Villars how can your plan it&s;elf take place? How can its beneficial effects be felt? How can the claims of ju&s;tice, which you &s;eem your&s;elf to allow, be &s;atisfied?"</P>
<P>"Time will do all for us. My father will forgive, when he &s;ees that the con&s;equences he &s;o dreads, have not followed the &s;tep he forbids. We &s;hall have injured no one, and be happy in each other.&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Oh! Henry, Henry! how &s;hould we be happy? There can be no happine&s;s for a child
<PB N="92" REF="036127_0090_10084EE0E8599ED0">
in di&s;obedience to a parent. No &s;ophi&s;try, no hope of &s;elfi&s;h joy can ob&s;cure &s;o evident a truth, can allure me to dare its violation. We have no choice; if lord Villars per&s;i&s;ts in his oppo&s;ition, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and &mdash;"</P>
<P>Part&mdash;&s;he would have &s;aid; but her tongue faltered, and &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>"Oh! Ellen, you have not the heart to utter the word, and can you per&s;i&s;t in the act?"</P>
<P>"Cruel nece&s;&s;ity forces it upon us. We can|not do otherwi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Well then be it &s;o," &s;aid he, after a pau&s;e: "but let not the parting be for ever. Let us yield in appearance to the pre&s;ent &s;torm. Let us pre&s;erve our hearts for each other, and refer our happine&s;s to a time when no imagined duty, no real inju&s;tice can &s;tep in between us."</P>
<P>"Dear Henry, do not &s;o tempt me. See you not the fallacy of this? See you not, that we &s;hould live on fal&s;ehood; and that the hypocri&s;y that affects the air of a difficult virtue, is, in it|&s;elf, the wor&s;t vice?"</P>
<P>"All your conclu&s;ions, Ellen, tend to one point. Would you then have me make obedience perfect? Do you advi&s;e me to marry lady Al|meria?"</P>
<P>"I am but a bad ca&s;ui&s;t," replied the weeping but unrelenting Ellen: "but I do not &s;ee that the duty which requires you to give up your own choice to the will of your father, exacts that you &s;hould adopt his in oppo&s;ition to your own."</P>
<P>"What then does he gain by the obedience you &s;o unfeelingly enforce?"</P>
<P>"At pre&s;ent the &s;atisfaction that mu&s;t re&s;ult to a parent from even the partial compliance of a child with his wi&s;hes; and, in future, the more
<PB N="93" REF="036127_0091_10084EE3B71FB5A8">
complete gratification of &s;eeing your choice and his the &s;ame."</P>
<P>"And can you bear to point out &s;uch a futu|rity? Can you <HI>de&s;ire</HI> it?"</P>
<P>"Let us not," &s;aid Ellen, trembling, "let us not deceive our&s;elves. It is with this hope the pre&s;ent &s;acrifice is required. Our renunciation of each other mu&s;t be complete&mdash;it mu&s;t be for <HI>ever.</HI>"</P>
<P>"For <HI>ever</HI> be it then," &s;aid Henry, ru&s;hing towards the door, "for now I &s;ee that you de&s;ire it."</P>
<P>"Stay, dear Henry."</P>
<P>"Dear! do you &s;ay I am dear?"</P>
<P>"<HI>Mo&s;t</HI> dear! do not inflict upon me the only trial to which I feel my&s;elf unequal. I can bear to give you up: but I cannot bear that you &s;hould believe me fickle or intere&s;ted."</P>
<P>"Oh would to God, I could believe you &s;o. But while I think of you as you are, how &s;hall I imitate you in the virtue that &s;o exalts you in my eyes?"</P>
<P>"It is from &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity that I act. You too mu&s;t feel its irre&s;i&s;tible power: and all the merit that either of us can have, is in the manner in which we &s;upport that nece&s;&s;ity."</P>
<P>"I do not yet admit the nece&s;&s;ity. If you refu&s;e to re&s;ign the rights you have over me, my father mu&s;t yield to them."</P>
<P>"Let us not go over the &s;ame ground," &s;aid the almo&s;t exhau&s;ted Ellen. "Nothing but lord Villars's con&s;ent to our marriage will ever ju&s;tify me to my&s;elf in becoming your wife, or you in my eyes for accepting me as &s;uch. Lord Villars has declared, and who can doubt his firmne&s;s, that his con&s;ent never &s;hall be obtained. The
<PB N="94" REF="036127_0092_10084EE7EECA0700">
con&s;equence is obvious. Dear Henry, receive my la&s;t farewel!"</P>
<P>"Never, never will I give you up&mdash;I will never relinqui&s;h you,&mdash;nay, you mu&s;t not, &s;hall not leave me."</P>
<P>"I <HI>mu&s;t;</HI> for wherefore &s;hould I &s;tay?"</P>
<P>"Go then: but be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall haunt you wherever you go. My father &s;hall gain nothing but my mi&s;ery by his inju&s;tice. If I cannot be your's, I will not be another's."</P>
<P>"You will think better of it," &s;aid Ellen, as &s;he opened the door; "farewel." She clo&s;ed it; and, her ta&s;k over, her powers for&s;ook her, and &s;he &s;unk into a chair motionle&s;s, and nearly with|out recollection. There was nobody to ob&s;erve her: and &s;he had time to return to her&s;elf. Sud|denly &s;he heard a movement in the room &s;he had quitted. She aro&s;e ha&s;tily, and pa&s;&s;ing up a pair of back &s;tairs, took refuge in her own chamber.</P>
<P>Henry, given up to his emotions, had remained where Ellen had left him. The &s;udden entrance of lord Villars rou&s;ed him from his grief. He &s;tarted at the &s;ight of him, as at &s;omething nox|ious; and pa&s;&s;ing furiou&s;ly by him, quitted the hou&s;e on the in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Lord Villars required no other proof of the part Ellen had taken; and exulting in the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;chemes, &s;ent a re&s;pectful me&s;&s;age to her, de&s;iring he might have the honour of returning his thanks in per&s;on. This was, however, a mark of complai&s;ance that Ellen thought &s;he might well be allowed to refu&s;e him. She therefore excu&s;ed her&s;elf by writing the&s;e words on a &s;crap of paper.</P>
<P>"As lord Villars will learn from his &s;on the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that has been paid to his will, there is

no doubt but he will willingly excu&s;e him&s;elf the &s;ight of a per&s;on who&s;e pre&s;ence mu&s;t be a reproach to him. Ellen therefore begs leave to decline the honour of appearing before him."</P>
<P>Lord Villars, even in the mid&s;t of his triumph, could not help feeling the &s;uperiority both of mr. Mordaunt and Ellen: and he withdrew from Groby Manor &s;ucce&s;sful it is true, but mortified; and his pride &s;everely hurt, that though he had overcome by the force of his power, he had not been able to deceive by his duplicity.</P>

<P>HENRY had found &s;helter at the par&s;onage; and it required all mr. Thornton's influence to bring his mind to any degree of moderation. Di&s;plea&s;ed yet enraptured with Ellen&mdash;indignant again&s;t his father, yet feeling the principle of filial love and filial duty &s;trong in his heart&mdash;his pa&s;|&s;ions were wrought up to a pitch of intemperance that allowed his rea&s;on no weight, and urged him to re&s;olutions that could only perpetuate and ju&s;tify his mi&s;ery. Mr. Thornton at length &s;ucceeded in calming him: but he could not prevail with him to relinqui&s;h the idea of endeavouring to extort from Ellen a promi&s;e that &s;he would pre&s;erve her heart for him, and wait in the hope that he might by &s;ome means induce his father to withdraw his objections. Mr. Thornton in vain repre&s;ented that he had no rea&s;on to doubt Ellen's joyful ac|quie&s;cence in any mea&s;ure that tended to unite them, and which had lord Villars's &s;anction; nor had he any thing to fear from the lightne&s;s of her mind, or the variablene&s;s of her inclination. But to &s;eek any conce&s;&s;ion on her part at this time, and much more any promi&s;e, would be to make
<PB N="97" REF="036127_0095_10084EF01D2C4300">
all the re&s;olution &s;he had hitherto &s;hewn, appear as a mean &s;ubterfuge; and would, in fact, in its effect, entirely de&s;troy what &s;he mo&s;t intended to e&s;tabli&s;h, his obedience to his father.</P>
<P>Henry felt as if there were &s;till &s;omething to be done, and it was intolerable to him, to &s;it down in inactive hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s. It was &s;ome relief to him to &s;eek Ellen in the wood, though &s;ure not to find her there. He acknowledged every evening, that the pur&s;uit was vain, yet went out every morning with revived expectation&punc; He wrote and his letter was returned. But again he wrote; becau&s;e to write was to do &s;omething; and while he made the effort, he for &s;o many minutes &s;u&s;|pended de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Ellen, not a whit le&s;s afflicted, though more patient than Henry, had indulged her&s;elf in one day's &s;eclu&s;ion from her family. The happine&s;s &s;he had given up, was too dear to her heart, not to demand from her a &s;incere tribute of grief to its memory. And indeed the agitation that her mind had undergone for the la&s;t twenty-four hours, made it nece&s;&s;ary that in private &s;he &s;hould calm and regulate her feelings. She &s;aw, how|ever, her father; and found in his care&s;&s;es and ap|probation the be&s;t reward for what &s;he had done, and her be&s;t &s;timulative to per&s;everance.</P>
<P>On the morrow &s;he appeared again in the breakfa&s;t room; re&s;umed her accu&s;tomed em|ployments; and endeavoured, by &s;omething like cheerfulne&s;s, to do her part toward di&s;pelling the gloom which &s;eemed to have &s;ettled over Groby Manor. By this conduct &s;he rendered innoxious the unkindne&s;s of her mother. All her taunts and &s;arca&s;ms rather lacerated her own than Ellen's heart; while Ellen appeared uncon&s;cious of her
<PB N="98" REF="036127_0096_10084EF302099F28">
de&s;ign to hurt her. She forbore to reproach others; and felt &s;he could her&s;elf he no ju&s;t ob|ject of reproach to any one. With the thoughts of the future &s;he did not di&s;turb her&s;elf. Perhaps &s;he believed that the image of Henry would never depart from her mind: but &s;he neither told her|&s;elf that it would be &s;o, or encouraged the idea when it occurred. Having re&s;olutely entered the path of duty, &s;he was re&s;olved to tread it, lead where it would: and if, in the pre&s;ent depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of her mind, &s;he formed a wi&s;h, it was to hear that Henry was equally rea&s;onable with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But however this temper of mind was the cer|tain road to happine&s;s in time to come, for the pre&s;ent &s;he was more than &s;ufficiently wretched to have gratified the wi&s;h of the mo&s;t malignant. It was not po&s;&s;ible to obliterate with a wi&s;h all remembrances of pa&s;t delight, or promi&s;ed felicity. It was not po&s;&s;ible to forget, that Henry had been alike the choice of her fancy and of her rea&s;on; that his love had been her be&s;t trea&s;ure; and that in relinqui&s;hing it, &s;he made him as wretched as &s;he made her&s;elf. The thought indeed of his mi&s;ery was often more than &s;he could bear. The work was &s;u&s;pended, and the book dropped from her hand, when her too faithful memory repre|&s;ented his tran&s;ports and his de&s;pair. His idea was, in fact, &s;o clo&s;ely united with every thing &s;he did, or thought, with every object around her, and with every occupation &s;he attempted, that to forget him was impo&s;&s;ible: and &s;he &s;ometimes doubted if &s;he &s;hould ever be able to remember him with le&s;s angui&s;h than at the pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>It is true, he gave her very little time for mak|ing the experiment. He was every day at Groby
<PB N="99" REF="036127_0097_10084EF4B6A0BDC0">
Manor: and though &s;he con&s;tantly refu&s;ed to &s;ee him, this did not make him forbear attempting to throw him&s;elf in her way, in all their formerly mo&s;t frequented walks. He wrote to her conti|nually. His letters were un&s;ealed: but &s;he re|turned them unread. Again he wrote to her, and he employed her &s;i&s;ters to inform her, that he could not believe &s;he did him the inju&s;tice to refu&s;e to look into his letters.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt frequently &s;aw him; and as he was touched with the mo&s;t &s;incere compa&s;&s;ion for his &s;ufferings, was willing to tolerate this unrea|&s;onablene&s;s for &s;ome little time, hoping that &s;uch indulgence would lead him to re&s;ume more com|mand over him&s;elf. But, in the mean time, his heart bled for Ellen, on whom, in &s;pite of her &s;elf-command and fortitude, this per&s;ecution had the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible effect.</P>
<P>At length, mr. Mordaunt found him&s;elf ob|liged to tell the unfortunate Henry, that he could no longer &s;uffer him to haunt the environs of Groby Manor; and that if he wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve his friend&s;hip, he mu&s;t quit Northumberland. Henry's &s;pirit took this ill, and he declared that nothing but an order under Ellen's hand &s;hould induce him to quit the country.</P>
<P>Ellen's heart bled for his di&s;tre&s;s. She forgot her own.</P>
<P>"I would &s;ee him once more," &s;aid &s;he, "whatever it might co&s;t me; but in &s;eeing him what relief &s;hall I afford him? He knows my heart. He knows how I &s;uffer with him. If we meet, we &s;hall enfeeble each other."</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt encouraged her to write to him. This was not an ea&s;y ta&s;k. But &s;he hoped &s;ome good might ari&s;e from her letter; and &s;he re&s;olved
<PB N="100" REF="036127_0098_10084EF768A405B0">
to write. After many le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful efforts, as &s;he thought, &s;he &s;ent him the following:</P>
<P>"It is a cruel per&s;ecution that you &s;ubject me to, my dear cou&s;in. Why do you force me to appear &s;evere and unkind, when I aim only at being ju&s;t and true? The relief that you require from me, I have it not in my power to grant. But in the example of obedience that I &s;eek to &s;et you, I offer you all the con&s;olation that our un|happy circum&s;tances allow. A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf I have not read your letters. How har&s;h it &s;ounds to &s;ay, that while affairs remain as they now are, I never will. This is the la&s;t of my writing that I can addre&s;s to you. Of all the power that once we might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have over each other, that which good will and friend&s;hip give, alone remains, if you would not have me believe that with you I have forfeited even <HI>this,</HI> you will en|deavour to make that ta&s;k <HI>ea&s;y,</HI> which I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> per|form, however <HI>difficult.</HI> I entreat you to leave Northumberland: and if we are ever to meet again, let it be without &s;elf-reproach on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>"Adieu! and every ble&s;&s;ing be your's, that attends on virtue. If there were a happine&s;s apart from rectitude, &s;uch is the hone&s;ty of my affection, that I could not wi&s;h it you."</P>
<P>After all, this was a bad letter&mdash;but Ellen was not in circum&s;tances to write a good one. It was received by Henry with tears of delight and angui&s;h. To &s;ee Ellen's hand-writing addre&s;&s;ed to him, filled his mind with joy. But there were &s;ome touches in the letter, and more e&s;pecially the purport or the whole, that &s;tung him almo&s;t to madne&s;s.&mdash;He ob&s;erved, that &s;he no longer
<PB N="101" REF="036127_0099_10084EF93A4A1E80">
called him her dear Henry, but her dear cou&s;in, as if the affection &s;he bore him was no longer ap|propriate to him&s;elf, but belonged only to the re|lation he held towards her. The relinqui&s;hing for ever all power over him but what aro&s;e from friend&s;hip and good-will, &s;hewed him, that &s;he did not wi&s;h to owe even his compliance with her reque&s;t, to any more ardent or particular feeling. Her earne&s;tne&s;s, that if ever they met again, they &s;hould meet without &s;elf-reproach, convinced him of her adherence to her principle, that their pre&s;ent &s;e|paration ought to be con&s;idered as the termination of their engagement, and that if they were again to meet, it mu&s;t be only as friends. The intima|tion, that &s;he wi&s;hed him no happine&s;s indepen|dent of rectitude, he thought pointed out a de&s;ire, that he &s;hould fully comply with his father's wi&s;hes. All the&s;e ob&s;ervations filled him with the mo&s;t poignant grief, and the la&s;t (in which, however, he was mi&s;taken) with the mo&s;t lively re&s;entment. Nothing, he now found, was to be hoped for, from a longer continuance in Northum|berland: and he therefore determined to be gone.</P>
<P>He committed to mrs. Thornton a few lines, which, as he a&s;&s;ured her they were his la&s;t fare|wel, &s;he did not &s;cruple to receive, and to engage that Ellen &s;hould read.&mdash;Thus he wrote:</P>
<P>"I go.&mdash;You reque&s;t it: and I comply. But it is not the cool principle of friend&s;hip that gives &s;uch ab&s;olute power over the mind. It is not a &s;en&s;e of your <HI>good-will,</HI> that throws me a vagabond on the world, without an object, without a mo|tive for action, and delivers me to all its dangers, robbed of the polar &s;tar, hope, to direct my cour&s;e. You have withdrawn your beneficial in|fluence:
<PB N="102" REF="036127_0100_1008509EA6D12240">
but it is not in your power to withdraw that which may impel me&mdash;perhaps to my ruin. They tell me you act nobly. It may be &s;o; for you <HI>were</HI> all excellence. But my faculties are too much clouded to di&s;tingui&s;h between right and wrong; and I can feel only your unkindne&s;s. Heaven &s;hield <HI>you</HI> from &s;elf-reproach, but for <HI>my&s;elf!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>"Adieu! adieu! my beloved, my <HI>own</HI> Ellen, appropriated to me by vows, by love!&mdash;No, I will not throw you back into the common herd of relations, you who have &s;o long been worn near my inmo&s;t &s;oul, the deare&s;t trea&s;ure I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. &mdash;Adieu! and may you &s;oon forget your cou&s;in."</P>

<Q><L>'Each &s;ub&s;tance of a grief hath twenty &s;hadows.'</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS letter was the &s;evere&s;t &s;troke Ellen had received. Its incoherence, the de&s;pair it mani|fe&s;ted, gave her an image of Henry's mind, that filled her with horror. It made her call in que&s;|tion the rectitude of all &s;he had done. She felt her&s;elf accountable for any exce&s;s that Henry might commit: and &s;he knew not, that &s;he was exculpated by <HI>any</HI> motive, from the guilt of having broken an engagement which had always acted like a charm upon Henry, and pre&s;erved him hitherto in the paths of virtue and prudence. While &s;he believed her&s;elf right, whatever &s;he &s;uffered in being &s;o, &s;he retained a &s;ource of comfort in her own brea&s;t that calmed her mo&s;t tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions, and lulled her loude&s;t griefs. But the &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;he was <HI>wrong,</HI> de&s;troyed this calm, and gave her up to the mo&s;t unmitigated affliction.</P>
<P>She was at one moment inclined to annul all &s;he had done; to declare her adherence to her engagements with Henry, and her de&s;ign to wait till lord Villars either withdrew his objections, or was no longer able to enforce them. But the conviction that &s;he was influenced to &s;uch de&s;igns, rather by the complainings of Henry, than by any rea&s;onings of her own, made her fir&s;t he&s;itate as to the rectitude of &s;uch a &s;tep, and then abandon the idea altogether. Sometimes &s;he thought to
<PB N="104" REF="036127_0102_10084F93F0F3EFC8">
write to Henry, openly to acknowledge all &s;he &s;uffered, and unequivocally to declare that her regards towards him were the &s;ame as ever. But &s;he con&s;idered that this was, in fact, to tell him only that, of which he could not doubt; and that as it could not be followed by any yielding of re|&s;olution on her part, it would only &s;erve to revive a hope that mu&s;t again be lo&s;t in &s;till bitterer di&s;|appointment. She con&s;idered further, that as &s;he had declared her renunciation of him to be final, whatever affection &s;he might in &s;uch early days of their &s;eparation &s;till be allowed to entertain for him, yet that it ought by every pa&s;&s;ing hour to become le&s;s and le&s;s; and that therefore &s;he was bound to avoid any profe&s;&s;ions that might &s;eem to promi&s;e a continuance of this love, or which might encourage him to keep alive in his brea&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion which &s;he had exhorted him to &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>On the whole, &s;he was convinced that her &s;treng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was to fit &s;till; that &s;he had nothing far|ther to do, but to bear her own burden with all the patience &s;he could; and by obtruding her&s;elf as little as po&s;&s;ible on the memory of Henry, to accelerate that period, when &s;he would be able to look back on the pre&s;ent painful tran&s;actions, as on the impre&s;&s;ions made by a painful dream.</P>
<P>This was what the plain &s;en&s;e and the true virtue of Ellen &s;ugge&s;ted to her, as the be&s;t line of conduct &s;he could pur&s;ue; and in pur&s;uing it &s;he hoped in time to reap the reward &s;he &s;o well de&s;erved, peace of mind to her&s;elf. But &s;uch quiet forbearance, when exertion would have been &s;o flattering to the feelings of her heart, was not without efforts &s;o painful, that in the &s;truggle, the colour for&s;ook her cheek; &s;he lo&s;t her appetite and re&s;t; and, in &s;pite of all her at|tempts
<PB N="105" REF="036127_0103_10084F973B5D3078">
to the contrary, Ellen was but the gho&s;t of what &s;he had once been.</P>
<P>In quitting Northumberland, Henry knew not where to go. To go to his father he felt was im|po&s;&s;ible. He had no motive for returning to his chambers: and neither duty nor inclination called him el&s;ewhere. He was indeed the very vagabond he had de&s;cribed him&s;elf to Ellen: and he felt carele&s;s as to what he did, or what became of him.</P>
<P>Lord Villars had carefully watched him from the time that he had him&s;elf quitted Groby Ma|nor: and he was hence convinced that from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Henry's mind, nothing favourable to his future hopes was now to be attempted. He &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary to regain his influence over him by kindne&s;s; and to refer to &s;ome di&s;tant time the completion of tho&s;e views that he by no means gave up. He was, however, aware, that even tenderne&s;s from him at this time would be &s;u&s;pected: and he therefore employed lady Villars to &s;ooth the pa&s;&s;ions of her &s;on, and to &s;often his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Lady Villars was a per&s;on of a good heart, but of very little under&s;tanding. She had always been accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of her hu&s;band. By him &s;he had been taught the impo&s;&s;ibility of allowing their elde&s;t &s;on, to connect him&s;elf with a woman of no fortune, and the con&s;equent ruin of their family if he did &s;o. This idea was by habit become &s;o &s;trong, that &s;he could as ea&s;ily have changed her nature, as have abandoned it. She therefore looked upon the &s;e|paration of Ellen and Henry as unavoidable: but &s;he did not therefore look upon it with le&s;s pity&punc;
<PB N="106" REF="036127_0104_10084F9BC0D24420">
and &s;he thought that every thing ought to be done, that could make their &s;acrifice ea&s;y to them. That in time they would each be happy a&s;under, &s;he had no doubt: but &s;he wi&s;hed time to be given them. Lord Villars from le&s;s kind motives, was of the &s;ame opinion. He engaged lady Villars to write to her &s;on, a&s;&s;uring him of the tender concern that both &s;he and his father took in his happine&s;s, prai&s;ing him for the compliance he had &s;hewn to their wi&s;hes, and promi&s;ing him that no other woman &s;hould be offered to his accep|tance, 'till the remembrance of pa&s;t connexions was obliterated. From her&s;elf &s;he invited him to join her in&s;tantly at the park, from whence his father was ab&s;ent, expre&s;&s;ing an anxious de&s;ire to &s;ee him, and a&s;&s;uring him, he &s;hould &s;ee nobody there that he did not wi&s;h to &s;ee. This conclu|&s;ion was meant to point to lady Almeria; and it was &s;o under&s;tood by Henry.</P>
<P>On the receipt of this letter, he felt him&s;elf irre&s;i&s;tibly drawn towards his mother. Her ten|derne&s;s he had always experienced: and it was peculiarly tempting at this in&s;tant, when he felt abandoned by the whole world. He hoped, too, from the facility of her under&s;tanding, to be able to per&s;uade her of the inju&s;tice there was in his giving up Ellen: and he knew, from the purity of her principles, that what &s;he believed to be unju&s;t, &s;he would never think eligible.</P>
<P>He repaired, therefore, immediately to the park; and found, from the tenderne&s;s of lady Villars, all the con&s;olation that he had hoped. But he was di&s;appointed in his expectation of drawing her over to his &s;ide. Of the ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of the matter, &s;he declared her&s;elf incom|petent to judge: but &s;he knew it was impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="107" REF="036127_0105_10084F9D484B36F8">
he &s;hould marry a woman without fortune: and what it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid, however grievous, it was nece&s;&s;ary to endure.</P>
<P>Thus, from the &s;hortne&s;s of capacity in his mo|ther, and the obdurate ambition of his father, Henry found he mu&s;t give up all hopes of redre&s;s to his wrongs, or relief from his mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>From this dreadful derelection of him &s;elf, the policy, though not the kindne&s;s, of his father re|lieved him.</P>
<P>Lord Villars had conducted lady Almeria to an e&s;tate &s;he had in Devon&s;hire; and had left her under the care of an aunt, who was left joint guardian with him&s;elf. He had left her with an a&s;&s;urance, that a few months would obliterate all traces of Ellen from the brea&s;t of Henry; and that twelve months would not pa&s;s before they &s;aw the full completion of her wi&s;hes. He expected, by thus keeping up her hopes, that he could pre|&s;erve her con&s;tancy; and that, though the period might be &s;tretched much beyond that he predicted, &s;he would be in no ha&s;te to form any other con|nexion. To le&s;&s;en the danger of her doing &s;o, he recommended to her aunt, that &s;he &s;hould pa&s;s the coming winter in Devon&s;hire: and he engaged that lady Villars, him&s;elf, and &s;on, &s;hould vi&s;it her there.</P>
<P>Having thus provided as much as circum&s;tances admitted, for the &s;ecurity of his prize, he pur|po&s;ely moved from place to place, avoiding the meeting with his &s;on 'till he learnt from lady Villars, that, though he &s;eemed to have &s;unk into a deep melancholy, his re&s;entment appeared to have &s;ub&s;ided; and that &s;he thought they might now meet with advantage to both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Lord Villars, on this intimation, went imme|diately
<PB N="108" REF="036127_0106_10084F9ED0BFEB08">
to the park; and by the mo&s;t winning addre&s;s, and the kinde&s;t manners, &s;trove to regain the confidence, and awaken the dormant affection of his &s;on. He &s;poke to him of Ellen, and always in the mo&s;t flattering terms; &s;carcely &s;eemed le&s;s hurt than Henry, that &s;o much merit &s;hould be lo&s;t to them; and deplored the nece&s;&s;ity (upon the &s;trength of which he always took care to dwell) that &s;eparated them: of any farther choice he gave no hint, &s;aving that he &s;ometimes &s;aid, that with the &s;ingle qualification of fortune provided for, the whole female &s;ex lay before him.</P>
<P>To the kindne&s;s of a parent, however &s;u&s;pi|cious, Henry could not be long in&s;en&s;ible. He felt it as a balm to his wounds; and was &s;ome|times &s;o far &s;educed by it, as to hope that in time his father might relent. He wi&s;hed, therefore, for every rea&s;on, to pre&s;erve the good under&s;tand|ing between them: and Ellen had &s;oon the con|&s;olation of hearing, that they appeared on the be&s;t terms together. The inference, indeed, that it was natural to draw from &s;uch information, would not perhaps have been very con&s;oling to any mind le&s;s true and di&s;intere&s;ted than Ellen's. But in having given up Henry to a &s;en&s;e of duty, &s;he had made no re&s;ervation whatever. She meant wholly and for ever to give him up: and in this circum&s;tance &s;he found no comfort &s;o &s;oothing to her heart, as to know that he began to recover his peace of mind, and to re&s;ume the path of duty and obedience. It would lead him ultimately, &s;he doubted not, to marriage with &s;ome woman of his father's choice: and &s;he of|fered up no other prayer, when this idea occurred, but that &s;he might al&s;o be &s;o much the choice of Henry, as to &s;ecure his happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="036127_0107_10084FA1F35C3D38">It was not, indeed, before &s;he wanted it, that this comfort reached her. The impre&s;&s;ion which his letter had made upon her feelings, &s;he had found it impo&s;&s;ible to efface. Her mind was equal to any exertion: but her con&s;titution &s;unk under that which &s;he made to appear ea&s;y and cheerful, while her heart was torn by the mo&s;t ex|cruciating fears for the happine&s;s and good con|duct of Henry.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt &s;aw, with extreme anxiety, her increa&s;ing thinne&s;s, her lo&s;s of colour, and a kind of feeblene&s;s that &s;eemed creeping over all her faculties: and he felt, with &s;omething like di&s;ap|pointment, that he thought he &s;aw even Ellen unequal to the ta&s;k of ri&s;ing &s;uperior to an unfor|tunately placed pa&s;&s;ion. Ellen had felt, that there was &s;o much to condemn in Henry's letter, that &s;he had carefully concealed its contents from every creature. Mr. Mordaunt knew not, there|fore, the real &s;pring from whence her bittere&s;t &s;orrow flowed: and imputing her &s;orrows wholly to di&s;appointed love, he &s;aw, with &s;urpri&s;e, an improvement take place both in her looks and &s;pirits, from the moment &s;he knew Henry was living in his father's hou&s;e, and that they were friends together.</P>
<P>He ventured di&s;tantly to try her on this &s;ubject, and to probe her feelings, to &s;ee how far &s;he could endure Henry's marriage with another. She under&s;tood him, and replied with the mo&s;t perfect openne&s;s.</P>
<P>"My heart is lightened of its only intolerable weight, now I am a&s;&s;ured that Henry is in the road of duty. All the &s;orrows that belong to my&s;elf, I know I can bear, and, in time, &s;ubdue.
<PB N="110" REF="036127_0108_10084FA607A3B428">
I look for Henry's marriage! I acknowledge that my anxiety on the &s;ubject will be great: but when I relea&s;ed him from his engagements with me, it was for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of his forming new ones with another."</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt could only cla&s;p Ellen to his heart, and call her, what he thought her, the mo&s;t rational of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>From this time, mr. Mordaunt &s;aw a vi&s;ible improvement take place daily in Ellen. But to &s;uppo&s;e that a perfect cure could be wrought while &s;he continued at Groby Manor, where every object reminded her of Henry, &s;eemed as unrea|&s;onable as to expect that ea&s;e could be re&s;tored to a per&s;on while &s;till bound to the rack. Mr. Mor|daunt felt that &s;he called for every a&s;&s;i&s;tance po&s;|&s;ible for her to receive: and however inconvenient it might be, with regard to pecuniary con&s;idera|tions, he determined, with his family, to &s;pend part of the en&s;uing winter at Bath.</P>
<P>Ellen received the propo&s;al with the gratitude it called for. She knew, the reluctance that &s;he felt to quit Groby Manor, was an unfavourable &s;ymp|tom: and &s;he hoped change of place might indeed contribute towards making her more the per&s;on &s;he wi&s;hed to be, than &s;he felt &s;he was at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Lord Villars ob&s;erved, that on the part of Henry there appeared nothing like a return to cheerfulne&s;s: and he began to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;o far from intending to get the better of his pa&s;&s;ion for Ellen, he &s;ecretly nouri&s;hed it, and that having re&s;olved to keep him&s;elf free from every other engagement, he looked forward to the time when his father's death would &s;et him at liberty to follow his own inclination. The no-marriage of Henry was nearly as detrimental to lord Villars's
<PB N="111" REF="036127_0109_10084FA8EFB36D00">
family views, as his marriage with a woman of no fortune. And he dreaded &s;eeing his &s;on con|firmed in &s;entiments he knew it would be beyond any &s;tretch of his power to overthrow. He had, indeed, gue&s;&s;ed pretty nearly the &s;tate of Henry's mind: &s;omething, much re&s;embling the above plan, was forming it&s;elf &s;trongly into a re&s;olution, except that not daring to date his happine&s;s from his father's death, he had &s;ub&s;tituted in idea the vague term of &s;ome di&s;tant period, though well his rea&s;on a&s;&s;ured him, that no period, however di&s;tant, during his father's life, could unite him, with his con&s;ent, to Ellen.</P>
<P>Having in &s;ome mea&s;ure fixed his own plan, the thought that mo&s;t tormented him aro&s;e from the apprehen&s;ion that Ellen might be induced to connect her&s;elf with another. It was this fear that had made him &s;o &s;trenuous to draw from her a promi&s;e, that &s;he would pre&s;erve her heart for him. Her refu&s;al had nearly di&s;tracted him: and the dread that her yielding might make all his con&s;tancy vain, &s;till continued to overwhelm his mind, with the deepe&s;t gloom.</P>
<P>Lord Villars knew that though by his power he had &s;eparated Henry and Ellen, he could pro|ceed no farther. To oblige Henry to take ano|ther wife, was what he could not do: and he now &s;aw, that it was only from the change which time might make in the inclinations of Henry, that he could hope the complete &s;ucce&s;s of his de&s;igns. To keep him in the country, brooding over his di&s;appointment, and indulging in romantic plans of everla&s;ting con&s;tancy, was not the way to acce|lerate this change. He therefore caught eagerly at a wi&s;h, &s;lightly expre&s;&s;ed by Henry, that he might be allowed to go for &s;ome time to his
<PB N="112" REF="036127_0110_10084FABF282F438">
chambers in town. To town therefore he went: and lord Villars employed every art to draw him from the gloom of Lincoln's-Inn to the haunts of gaiety and amu&s;ement. He had the &s;atisfaction to hear, that his &s;chemes were not wholly un&s;uc|ce&s;sful.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time &s;pent &s;ullenly alone, Henry began to regain his cheerfulne&s;s; to a&s;&s;ociate with the young and di&s;&s;ipated; and to be once again the delight of his companions. He now &s;tood on a precipice, and, in the wreck of his love and happine&s;s, his principles and his virtue were well nigh involved.</P>
<P>But from the mi&s;chiefs to which the mercenary views of a parent expo&s;ed him, he was pre&s;erved by his pa&s;&s;ion for a virtuous woman, from whom that parent wi&s;hed to &s;ever him for ever. The mi&s;ery of his mind, when alone, drove him into company; nor was it the &s;till voice of rational conver&s;e, or the quiet complacence of dome&s;tic &s;cenes, that could overcome the louder tone of grief, which &s;pake within, or control the contend|ing pa&s;&s;ions that were boiling in his brea&s;t. Pa&s;|&s;ion mu&s;t be oppo&s;ed to pa&s;&s;ion. The fe&s;tive roar of laughter&punc; the di&s;&s;onant bray of Bacchus, were alone &s;ufficiently powerful to overcome the &s;en&s;e he retained of his di&s;appointment; no wonder if in &s;uch company, with a mind &s;o di&s;ordered, his

<P>Who does not tremble for Henry? One &s;tep

beyond where now he &s;tood, and he had fallen, not to ri&s;e again but through the rugged paths of penitence and remor&s;e.</P>
<P>But the words in Ellen's letter, "if ever we meet again, let us meet free from &s;elf reproach," had never departed from his memory. To meet again, to meet again as allowably dear to each other, as they had once been, was a hope &s;o in|terwoven with his very exi&s;tence, that he felt, life and it mu&s;t expire together. But to meet her unworthy of her, was a mi&s;ery beyond any he had yet known. To lo&s;e her by his own fault, he knew would be di&s;traction: and &s;tarting from the idea with horror, he re&s;olved to quit a life where every moment teemed with temptations which he could not yield to without entailing on him&s;elf the &s;evere&s;t &s;elf reproach.</P>
<P>However re&s;olute he might be to avoid vice, he yet found that di&s;&s;ipation of &s;ome kind was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to a mind, &s;o cruelly thwarted in its fa|vourite views as his was, and all its plans for the happine&s;s of every louring hour thus deranged.</P>
<P>He determined to &s;eek this di&s;&s;ipation abroad, where, even from amu&s;ement, he might draw in&s;truction, and where, while he diverted his melancholy, he might cultivate his under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>He applied to lord Villars for permi&s;&s;ion to leave England; and received a ready compliance with his wi&s;hes. Lord Villars, however, ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee him fir&s;t: and Henry ha&s;tened down into Hamp&s;hire. Lord Villars had art|fully &s;ent off lady Villars into Devon&s;hire before his arrival: and, when Henry a&s;ked for his mo|ther, he was told where &s;he was, and that &s;he
<PB N="114" REF="036127_0112_10084FB16D3D3510">
was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, that &s;he could not travel into Hamp&s;hire to &s;ee him, and &s;till le&s;s could &s;he &s;uffer him to quit England without bidding him adieu.</P>
<P>Henry &s;aw the trap: but, firm in his own con|&s;tancy, he did not fear any con&s;equence, that could be drawn from vi&s;iting a &s;ick parent in lady Almeria's hou&s;e. He therefore readily accom|panied his father into Devon&s;hire: and when there, he &s;ought, by a &s;tudied coldne&s;s towards lady Almeria, to evince to every body, that it was only a parent that he did vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria was, however, young and hand|&s;ome: and &s;he &s;hewed him &s;o flattering a pre|ference, that Henry, who was no anchoret, found it impo&s;&s;ible to maintain his re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria was a little giddy-brain, who either felt or cared for no con&s;equence, let her &s;ay or do what &s;he would. She laughed and romped with Henry; rallied his grave airs; talked of her own pa&s;&s;ion; boa&s;ted the con&s;tancy with which &s;he would wait his return; and &s;eemed &s;o &s;ure of her pa&s;&s;ion being an&s;wered, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to tell her &s;he was mi&s;taken. Henry was amu&s;ed, and perhaps flattered by all this: but his heart was only the more immovably attached to Ellen; for who could thought of exchanging her for lady Almeria? His &s;pirits received great improvement from his &s;ojourn in Levon&s;hire: but he quitted England without having wavered for a moment in his re&s;olution, of having no other wife but Ellen.</P>
<P>Lord Villars &s;aw enough, during Henry's vi&s;it into Devon&s;hire, to rai&s;e his hopes; but he al&s;o &s;aw that while Ellen remained unmarried, they probably would never be fulfilled; her marriage,
<PB N="115" REF="036127_0113_10084FB634D7F440">
therefore, became a point with him, and he em|ployed his &s;i&s;ter to bring this about if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;oon learnt, from her mother, the vi&s;it Henry had made in Devon&s;hire, and &s;he learnt it under all the exaggerated forms that malicious mi&s;repre&s;entation can give. In the pain that Ellen felt, at this information, &s;he acknowledged the little progre&s;s &s;he had made in driving Henry from her heart: but even here her pain was not wholly &s;elfi&s;h; in the character of lady Almeria &s;he &s;aw nothing that could make Henry happy: and again &s;he felt her&s;elf accountable for his lo&s;s of happine&s;s, as &s;he had before done for his pro|bable lo&s;s of rectitude.</P>

<P>THE whole Mordaunt family had now been &s;ome months at Bath. Ellen had impo&s;ed upon her&s;elf to partake of all the amu&s;ements of the place: &s;he therefore refu&s;ed no amu&s;ement that was offered her. The mornings were &s;pent at breakfa&s;ts, and the evenings in balls. But a way of life, &s;o little &s;uited either to her pre&s;ent inclinations, or to her habits, exhau&s;ted both her mind and body, and &s;he was often compelled, from wearine&s;s and indi&s;po&s;ition, to remain at home.</P>
<P>At home, indeed &s;he never failed of pa&s;&s;ing the hours extremely to her &s;atisfaction. Her mo|ther and &s;i&s;ters were con&s;tantly engaged, and her father as con&s;tantly at lei&s;ure: but he was &s;eldom alone: and his &s;ociety and that of his friends, was much more &s;uited to Ellen's di&s;po&s;ition, than any, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her heart and &s;pirits, &s;he met with in public</P>
<P>Sir William Ackland was among the mo&s;t con|&s;tant of her father's vi&s;itors: and it &s;oon became evident, that he was not the le&s;s &s;o from his be|ing now, from her increa&s;ed indi&s;po&s;ition, almo&s;t &s;ure to meet Ellen in her father's drawing-room.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="036127_0115_10084FBBA69198A0">Sir William Ackland was one and forty: but he united to an uncommonly elegant and youth|ful looking per&s;on, the poli&s;hed manners of a man who had lived much in the world. He had pa&s;&s;ed many years of his life abroad, was a man of &s;en&s;e and ob&s;ervation, and particularly excelled in the art of conver&s;ation. When &s;ilent there was &s;ome|thing au&s;tere in his countenance and manner: but when he &s;poke, the gloom di&s;per&s;ed, and he ap|peared all gaiety and good humour. His fortune was ample: and it was under&s;tood among his ac|quaintance, that he was re&s;olved to &s;ettle in Eng|land, and marry.</P>
<P>It was apparent, from &s;ir William's fir&s;t know|ledge of Ellen, that he watched her attentively; but he &s;eemed rather to &s;tudy her character, than to be in love with her per&s;on. Ellen &s;aw, in &s;ir William Ackland, nothing but an agreeable friend of her father's; his conver&s;ation plea&s;ed her, and uncon&s;cious of his de&s;igns, and without any her|&s;elf, &s;he conver&s;ed with him with a freedom and unre&s;erve which &s;oon di&s;played the &s;tores of her under&s;tanding and the goodne&s;s of her heart.</P>
<P>This freedom was not checked on the part of &s;ir William, by any attentions that could obtrude the idea of a lover upon her fancy. She &s;aw him every day the &s;ame, polite, obliging, and friendly: but though Henry, Ellen's prototype of love, was all there, he was &s;o much more, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible that Ellen &s;hould believe effects &s;o differ|ent &s;hould &s;pring from the &s;ame cau&s;e. It never once occured to her that &s;ir William &s;ought her for a wife: and had &s;he been con&s;ulted on the &s;ubject, &s;he would have thought her elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter more &s;uited to the &s;tation.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="036127_0116_10084FBD2F56D9C8">But this was not the opinion either of &s;ir Wil|liam, or of mr. Mordaunt. The latter thought he &s;aw, in an union with &s;ir William Ackland, an a&s;ylum for Ellen from all the ill humour of her mother. In the opulence of &s;ir William's fortune, he believed, was &s;ecured to Ellen a never failing &s;ource of the indulgence of her benevo|lence&punc; and he thought her &s;ituation, as his wife, would call into action all the powers of her un|der&s;tanding, and all the virtues of her heart. All the enquiries he could make into the character of &s;ir William were an&s;wered favourably: and though through his long ab&s;ence from England, he was not intimately known to any body, he was uni|formly &s;poken of as a man of a liberal mind, in|tegrity and virtuous di&s;po&s;itions. It &s;oon, there|fore, became the favourite wi&s;h of mr. Mordaunt, to &s;ee Ellen united with &s;ir William Ackland: but as he was aware the more time elap&s;ed be|fore the propo&s;al was made, the more likely it was to &s;ucceed; all the efforts that he made, were rather to retard than to bring it on.</P>
<P>Ellen had, however, an open and profe&s;&s;ed lover. He al&s;o was a baronet, a &s;tout hale man of fifty, who, with a good con&s;titution, and two thou&s;and pounds a year, declared he wanted no|thing but a young wife, and an heir to his e&s;tate. Ellen laughed both at his wants and his wi&s;hes; nor did &s;he conceive it po&s;&s;ible that any body &s;hould treat his preten&s;ions more &s;eriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>But if mr. Mordaunt de&s;ired &s;ir William Ack|land for his &s;on-in-law, mrs. Mordaunt had not le&s;s earne&s;tly fixed her mind upon &s;ir John Sin|clair. By marrying Ellen to him, &s;he would fulfil the ta&s;k lord Villars had given her to performs and by giving &s;uch a hu&s;band to Ellen, &s;he would
<PB N="119" REF="036127_0117_10084FC016C98EA0">
gratify the never cea&s;ing di&s;like &s;he entertained towards her. For a girl with fifteen hundred pounds to her fortune, to refu&s;e &s;uch an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, appeared to her madne&s;s: and poor Ellen was obliged to be very &s;erious in a matter that appeared highly ridiculous to her.</P>
<P>Her &s;teady refu&s;al of &s;uch honours drew upon her from her mother, &s;o much reproach and ob|loquy, as made her life completely wretched. Sir William Ackland carefully ob&s;erved all the family proceedings in this matter: and he was not more plea&s;ed to remark that pecuniary advantages alone would not di&s;po&s;e of Ellen, than he was with the mildne&s;s with which &s;he endured all the ill treat|ment her oppo&s;ition to her mother's unrea&s;onable de&s;ires occa&s;ioned her. He wi&s;hed, indeed, to &s;ee how &s;he would conduct her&s;elf to a younger lover; for there was &s;omething in the ridicule with which, while the affair continued a laughing matter in the family, &s;he had treated the notion of &s;ir John Sinclair's thinking him&s;elf a &s;uitable hu&s;band for her, that had pre&s;&s;ed rather unplea|&s;antly upon &s;ome of &s;ir William's feelings; nor were his wi&s;hes long ungratified.</P>
<P>Among the numerous partners whom the for|tune of the dance had con&s;igned to Ellen, there was one young man, who, being ju&s;t come to his e&s;tate, and ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, imagined that the fir&s;t woman he liked to flirt with, was the one with whom he could be happy for life. He made love with the &s;ame ea&s;e he would have made tea; and received Ellen's refu&s;al with the &s;ame non|chalance, as he had made his propo&s;al. As he wanted neither &s;en&s;e nor money, was hand&s;ome and full as well bred as mo&s;t of the young men
<PB N="120" REF="036127_0118_10084FC19F2FF2A0">
of the age, there was no very often&s;ible rea&s;on for the peremptorine&s;s of Ellen's negative.</P>
<P>It had been &s;ufficient with her, that he did not rai&s;e one emotion of any kind in her mind, and that marriage was the thing lea&s;t in her thoughts, and her wi&s;hes. But the talkers around her &s;ought for &s;ome le&s;s &s;imple cau&s;e, to account for a young woman of &s;mall fortune, refu&s;ing to &s;ettle her&s;elf advantageou&s;ly in the world. With many it was imputed to her de&s;ign of becoming lady Sinclair. But &s;ir William knew that this was not the ca&s;e. Others averred that &s;he had fixed her hopes and de&s;igns upon &s;ir William him&s;elf: and this &s;ir William felt not at all di&s;po&s;ed to que&s;tion. He was complimented by &s;o many upon his con|que&s;t, that he began to per&s;uade him&s;elf, (what cannot love and vanity per&s;uade a man to?) that if &s;he refu&s;ed the rich and the young, it was be|cau&s;e his merit had penetrated her heart. The complai&s;ance and attention with which &s;he always li&s;tened to him, and the &s;uperiority that his per|&s;onal attractions and outward manners gave him over all the other men who approached her, made this no very extraordinary or unpardonable mi&s;|take. On this mi&s;take he grounded his re&s;olution of explaining him&s;elf to mr. Mordaunt.</P>
<P>The &s;pring was now far advanced: and the family were to quit Bath in le&s;s than a fortnight. Sir William therefore wi&s;hed, before he lo&s;t &s;ight of them, to leave no doubt of his future intentions. He accordingly opened his heart to mr. Mordaunt: but he repre&s;ented to him that being only a few weeks returned to England, he had much bu&s;ine&s;s to adju&s;t before he could enter into matrimony. He therefore propo&s;ed to arrange his affairs, to vi&s;it his country re&s;idence, and afterwards, if mr.
<PB N="121" REF="036127_0119_10084FC605CDB7C0">
Mordaunt encouraged him to hope, he flattered him&s;elf he might be allowed to pay his devoirs to Ellen, in Northumberland.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt received &s;ir William's declaration with manife&s;t plea&s;ure; and with the frankne&s;s that di&s;tingui&s;hed his character, immediately in|formed him of the attachment that had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Ellen and Henry. He repre&s;ented the ca&s;e exactly as it was; and a&s;&s;ured &s;ir William, that he had no doubt but that Ellen's mind grew every day more free from every remains of predi|lection in her cou&s;in's favour. But he gave it as his opinion, that as &s;ir William mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;ome weeks before he could openly declare him&s;elf, it might be productive of good effects, if he deferred his intended vi&s;it into Northumberland 'till the autumn. In the mean time, mr. Mor|daunt promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve the inclinations of his daughter, and to deal with perfect fairne&s;s in the repre&s;entations he &s;hould make of them, from time to time, to &s;ir William.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt, who could not conceive that a man, who had pa&s;&s;ed his fortieth year, could expect a young woman, not yet twenty, to have fallen in love with him, or that it was probable that &s;he &s;hould not have had &s;ome attachment or prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion more &s;uited to her years, had no &s;u&s;picion that by the frankne&s;s of his dealing he pierced &s;ir William's heart with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible di&s;ap|pointment, and opened it in future to all the tortures of rage and jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>This prior love of Ellen's explained in a way not at all flattering to &s;ir William's vanity, her indifference to the riches of &s;ir John Sinclair, and the youth of mr. Bowden: and if he were to hope it were to be overcome in his favour, he
<PB N="122" REF="036127_0120_10084FC911044708">
found he was to owe his better fortune rather to time, and perhaps to the recommendation of a parent, intere&s;ted in his behalf, than to his own merit.</P>
<P>The chagrin that he felt on this di&s;covery made him readily come into mr. Mordaunt's propo&s;al, that any farther declaration &s;hould be delayed: and he de&s;igned to quit Bath without again &s;eeing Ellen. Accident however prevented this. Going to vi&s;it mr. Mordaunt one evening, when he had under&s;tood &s;he was to be at the ball, he found her in the drawing room: and &s;he appeared, from the accidental mode of her dre&s;s, or from &s;ome other cau&s;e, more attractive in her manner and appearance, than he had ever before thought her.</P>
<P>"I feared," &s;aid he, the moment he &s;aw her, "that you were to have been at the ball."</P>
<P>"Then I am not to flatter my&s;elf," &s;aid &s;he gaily, "that this vi&s;it is to me?"</P>
<P>"Should you think it flattering if it were &s;o?"</P>
<P>"I am not &s;ure I &s;hould call it flattering; but I am &s;ure I &s;hould call it very plea&s;ant."</P>
<P>There was a na&iuml;vete and truth in the&s;e words, that went to &s;ir William's heart.</P>
<P>"If I am not to be the fir&s;t man &s;he has loved," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "I may be the &s;econd. And if from this moment I might be the only one, I &s;hould be happy."</P>
<P>In this night's conver&s;ation, mr. Mordaunt was wholly forgotten: and &s;ir William's attentions and admiration were &s;o apparent, that Ellen could not help &s;eeing him in a light he had never ap|peared to her in before. When he was gone, mr. Mordaunt ventured to rally Ellen on her con|que&s;t: and &s;he replied with &s;o much prai&s;e of &s;ir
<PB N="123" REF="036127_0121_10084FCBA7895A68">
William, that mr. Mordaunt thought him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The effect this evening had upon &s;ir William, was &s;uch, that in&s;tead of leaving Bath at the time he de&s;igned, he continued there till the la&s;t mo|ment of mr. Mordaunt's &s;tay; and &s;pent &s;o many hours in his hou&s;e, and with Ellen, that &s;he could not doubt, but that, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent, &s;he had found the way to his heart. This was a di&s;|covery that certainly gave her no plea&s;ure; but neither did it excite much pain, nor give her any very lively alarm. There was &s;omething &s;o guarded even in the admiration that &s;ir William expre&s;&s;ed, as ea&s;ily per&s;uaded Ellen, who had no vanity to counteract her wi&s;hes, that he thought not of her as a wife, and that when once out of &s;ight, &s;he &s;hould be thought of no more. It was, however, with great &s;atisfaction, that &s;he &s;aw her|&s;elf removed from Bath: and the &s;ight of Groby Manor made her heart throb with delight. "Here," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "I &s;hall find an a&s;ylum from all gallantry. In tho&s;e &s;hades there will be no concert but the concert of the birds, no dancing but the quivering of the leaves."</P>
<P>She flew to the par&s;onage.</P>
<P>"My friends," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he embraced fir&s;t one and then the other, "I have not known &s;o happy a moment as this, &s;ince we parted."</P>
<P>Her return to Groby Manor &s;eemed to give her new life: and, unknown to her&s;elf, the e&s;cape &s;he thought &s;he had had from &s;ir William Ackland, diffu&s;ed peace and cheerfulne&s;s over her mind.</P>
<P>She re&s;umed all her occupations with a &s;pirit which &s;he had not experienced &s;ince her lo&s;s of Henry: and mr. Mordaunt thought him&s;elf autho|rized
<PB N="124" REF="036127_0122_10084FCEB0BB24B8">
in giving &s;ir William the mo&s;t flattering ac|counts of her di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>Ellen had, however, one continual cau&s;e of un|happine&s;s, which neither her rea&s;on nor her pa|tience could pre&s;erve her from feeling. This was the increa&s;ed ill humour of her mother. Baffled in her &s;cheme of marrying her, per&s;uaded that Ellen in &s;ecret meant to pre&s;erve her&s;elf for Henry, her re&s;entment and malice towards her knew no bounds. There was no one moment of the day when &s;he did not make her feel the fangs of her malevolence. All mr. Mordaunt's authority could not &s;hield Ellen from the &s;torm. The tongue is an in&s;trument of evil that cannot be re&s;trained. Bitter taunts, and &s;evere reproaches, may be re&s;ented; but cannot, when we are com|pelled to live with the tormentor, be avoided. Ellen's duplicity and pre&s;umption were the con|tinual topics of her mother's di&s;cour&s;e: and with the&s;e &s;he took care to mingle the mo&s;t confident a&s;&s;urances that all would prove vain, and that Henry would return to England only to marry lady Almeria.</P>
<P>From &s;uch attacks, Ellen took refuge, whenever &s;he could, at the par&s;onage: but they made mr. Mordaunt more and more impatient to &s;ee her under the protection of a man of worth, and to have her prove, by her marriage, the fal&s;ene&s;s of mrs. Mordaunt's calumnies.</P>
<P>Sir William grew impatient to vi&s;it Northum|berland: and mr. Mordaunt determined to delay his con&s;ent no longer than till he had opened the matter fully to Ellen.</P>

<P>ONE day, when mrs. Mordaunt had been more than commonly injurious, Ellen had withdrawn her&s;elf to her favourite wood, and had ju&s;t ea&s;ed her &s;welling heart, by a flood of tears, when her father, who had purpo&s;ely followed her from the hou&s;e, joined her. She would have concealed her emotion.</P>
<P>"My dear Ellen," &s;aid he, "your mother de|&s;erves no delicacy from you. Do not, for her &s;ake, deprive me of your full confidence: the &s;ympathy of one parent is but a due compen&s;ation for the cruelty of another."</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="036127_0124_10084FD5E544E4C0">"Your kindne&s;s, my father," &s;aid the weep|ing Ellen, "is a compen&s;ation for every evil: and I ought to bear injuries that I have not de&s;erved, with more fortitude."</P>
<P>"I ought to remove you from the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;uch injuries: and I would do &s;o too, even at the hazard of never &s;eeing my wife again, did I not hope a more amicable end to all your oppre&s;&s;ions, and &s;uch a one as will give the lie direct to all your mother's unju&s;t imputations."</P>
<P>Ellen regarded her father with a look of timid &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"What do you mean, &s;ir?"</P>
<P>"Your marriage with a man of worth will &s;e|cure your own happine&s;s; and prove, beyond all di&s;pute, the &s;incerity and good faith of that re|nunciation, the motives for which are now &s;o daily called in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"My marriage!" repeated Ellen, faintly.</P>
<P>"I want no further proof," cried mr. Mor|daunt warmly, "of the &s;trength of your mind, and the purity of your principles. I know, that the &s;acrifice you appeared to make, was &s;incere, that you never looked to futurity for an indemni|fication for pre&s;ent lo&s;&s;es: and I &s;ee, with equal plea&s;ure and admiration, that you are capable of receiving happine&s;s from another &s;ource than that which is dried up to you for ever. It is not, my love, that I am putting your hone&s;ty to the te&s;t: but it is that I think I am offering a reward to your virtues, when I talk to you of other con|nexions, when I name marriage."</P>
<P>"Marriage?" again repeated Ellen.</P>
<P>"Were your home as happy as I could wi&s;h to make it, yet marriage would be de&s;irable. Half the female virtues fade, or are u&s;ele&s;s, except in
<PB N="127" REF="036127_0125_10084FD86FB885B0">
marriage. You are formed to adorn them all: and having &s;uffered as a daughter, it is proper you &s;hould be rewarded as a wife."</P>
<P>"As a wife?" &s;aid Ellen.</P>
<P>"As a wife, my love; nor can I believe that with a man whom you could love, there is any thing very dreadful in the name of wife. Sir Wil|liam Ackland &s;eeks and de&s;erves your love. In giving you to him, I believe I &s;ecure your happi|ne&s;s: and have I not ob&s;erved that he is not di&s;|agreeable to you?"</P>
<P>"Di&s;agreeable! no, certainly."</P>
<P>"His per&s;on, his conver&s;ation plea&s;es you. You think him worthy, amiable?"</P>
<P>"Yes."</P>
<P>"You are not uncon&s;cious that he admires you?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"It would not be ungrateful to you that he &s;hould love you?"</P>
<P>Ellen was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Dear Ellen, why the&s;e mono&s;yllables? Why this &s;ilence?"</P>
<P>Ellen ga&s;ped for breath. Mr. Mordaunt took her hand. It was cold.</P>
<P>"You are ill?"</P>
<P>"No, I am better." And throwing her&s;elf into her father's arms, &s;he bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>"Dear &s;ir, forgive me. I will not be le&s;s all you wi&s;h me, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e fooli&s;h tears."</P>
<P>"They are not tears of reluctance, Ellen? I mean not to di&s;tre&s;s you. You are and &s;hall be mi&s;tre&s;s of your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"It mu&s;t come to this. I knew it would come to this! I will not abu&s;e your indulgence. But leave me, dear &s;ir, leave me: In two hours I will
<PB N="128" REF="036127_0126_10084FD9F66C1160">
tell you what I think I can do, what I believe I ought to do."</P>
<P>"I will leave you, my love: but do nothing merely becau&s;e you think I wi&s;h it. Let the rea|&s;ons why I wi&s;h it, have their weight, but not the wi&s;h it&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible! your wi&s;h mu&s;t be a motive with me."</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt retired: and Ellen ha&s;tened, as fa&s;t as her trembling limbs would carry her, to the par&s;onage. She found the little family a&s;&s;em|bled in that woodbine bower, where &s;o many happy hours of her childhood had been pa&s;&s;ed, where &s;he had &s;o often &s;tudied and &s;o often idled with Henry, where &s;he had a hundred times re|ceived his vows of everla&s;ting love, and where &s;he had as often promi&s;ed never to for&s;ake him. The recollection was too painful: &s;he &s;topt &s;hort. Her limbs failed her. Mr. Thornton caught her in his arms; and then giving her a gla&s;s of water, &s;he re&s;ted her head on mr. Thornton's &s;houlder, and was &s;aved by tears from fainting.</P>
<P>Mr. and mrs. Thornton hung over her with true parental affection, terrified with an emotion they had never witne&s;&s;ed in her before, yet afraid to increa&s;e her di&s;tre&s;s by inquiring into the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mary, as much alarmed, and le&s;s con&s;iderate, cried, "Dear, dear Ellen, what's the matter? Who now has done you wrong?"</P>
<P>"No one; my&s;elf I think. I did not think I &s;hould have been &s;o overcome. I meant to have been quite calm."</P>
<P>"But what, what is the matter?"</P>
<P>"Oh! my friends, you mu&s;t advi&s;e me. Yet, already I know what I ought to do."</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="036127_0127_10084FDB862CDF20">"Sir William Ackland would marry you?" interrupted Mary.</P>
<P>"My poor Ellen," &s;aid mr. Thornton.</P>
<P>"My dear &s;ir, my &s;econd father," &s;aid Ellen, looking up to mr. Thornton. "You &s;hall be my ca&s;ui&s;t. You &s;hall decide for me. What you determine, will be right aad good."</P>
<P>"Dear Ellen, you have decided your&s;elf. What is eligible, what tends to your happine&s;s nobody can doubt. The que&s;tion is, what can you do?"</P>
<P>"I <HI>can</HI> do that which you advi&s;e me to do."</P>
<P>"Sir William is plea&s;ant to your fancy, and approved of by your under&s;tanding. He is ami|able, he is kind: plain &s;en&s;e requires no other qualifications in the object of affection."</P>
<P>"But if the heart is not free?" &s;aid Mary.</P>
<P>"Will Ellen make that plea?" &s;aid mr. Thornton.</P>
<P>"No. If my heart is not yet &s;ir William Ackland's, I mean not to re&s;erve it for another."</P>
<P>"What is the heart but the power of be&s;tow|ing affections where there is merit enough to de|&s;erve them? Does not &s;ir William Ackland po&s;|&s;e&s;s that merit? And where can you look for mar|ried happine&s;s with better hopes of &s;ucce&s;s than with him?"</P>
<P>"No where I believe."</P>
<P>"You are above the romantic notion of living &s;ingle all your life, from having experienced one di&s;appointment; a notion, to &s;ay nothing of the fal&s;e and &s;elfi&s;h principles upon which it is grounded, that is u&s;ually attended by a much &s;e|verer &s;en&s;e of di&s;appointment than any occa&s;ioned by the events that gave birth to it."</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="036127_0128_10084FE0331E8858">"I hope I am. I have always di&s;dained &s;uch a notion."</P>
<P>"Have you one objection, which you would wi&s;h to act from, to an union with &s;ir William?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"Then, my dear Ellen," &s;aid mr. Thornton, embracing her, "the que&s;tion is decided. And if &s;ir William is the man you and mr. Mordaunt de&s;cribe him to be, your happine&s;s is al&s;o decided. No retro&s;pect will ever di&s;turb it."</P>
<P>"I am willing to think &s;o: but I mi&s;tru&s;t my|&s;elf. The emotion I have now betrayed &mdash;"</P>
<P>"If I &s;aw you in&s;en&s;ible I &s;hould be le&s;s &s;ure of your happine&s;s. But the &s;ame &s;entiments that formed your fir&s;t attachment, will form your &s;e|cond. It is upon &s;ir William's merits and your power of appreciating tho&s;e merits, that I ground my a&s;&s;urance of your happine&s;s. Your affection for him will fill the pre&s;ent void in your heart, will give a motive for action, and an intere&s;t to duty. If you have thought it po&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who have lo&s;t you to be happy in a &s;econd choice, you will not be able to &s;uppo&s;e you cannot be &s;o, without making your&s;elf too much, or too little of a compliment."</P>
<P>Ellen had nothing to reply to this; but turning to mrs. Thornton, &s;aid, "And you, my dear mo|ther, do you ratify this &s;entence?"</P>
<P>"Indeed I do. It is the dictate of good &s;en&s;e and good principles; high trea&s;on, I allow, again&s;t the laws of romance&punc; but when did you ever refer your actions to that fanta&s;tical code?"</P>
<P>"Never, thanks to you, my be&s;t friends&punc; and now I think I may engage I never &s;hall."</P>
<P>"I long to know &s;ir William," &s;aid mr. Thornton.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="036127_0129_10084FE310744BA8">"He will meet with your approbation, I have no doubt."</P>
<P>"Then mu&s;t he have more than common me|rit: le&s;s will not &s;atisfy me, when I am looking for a hu&s;band for you."</P>
<P>Ellen faintly &s;miled; and a&s;king Mary, who&s;e &s;ilence had marked her di&s;&s;atisfaction, to accom|pany her home, &s;aid &s;he had promi&s;ed, on parting with her father, to &s;ee him again in two hours.</P>
<P>"Heaven ble&s;s you, my dear child," &s;aid mr. and mrs. Thornton, both in a breath: and mr. Thornton added, "if moderation and rationality were to be per&s;onified, they would take no other form than Ellen's."</P>
<P>Ellen's heart was full. She pre&s;&s;ed their hands between her's; and &s;carcely uttering 'adieu,' walked along with Mary.</P>
<P>Mary had much in her mind: but of all that was there, &s;he was not able to utter a &s;yllable. Ellen talked of the &s;oftne&s;s of the evening, the fragrance of the woodbines, and the melody of the birds. Mary could neither &s;mell nor hear. Ellen changed the &s;ubject; and inquired con|cerning the la&s;t new book &s;he had read, and whe|ther the colours in her flower-piece &s;tood. Mary could bear no more.</P>
<P>"Oh! Ellen," cried &s;he, throwing her arms around her, "I could not do as you do."</P>
<P>"You could if you would. What your father &s;aid was unan&s;werable. My judgment is tho|roughly with him."</P>
<P>"And is it a matter of judgment?"</P>
<P>"A&s;&s;uredly. What but our judgment &s;hall correct the mi&s;takes of our hearts?"</P>
<P>"I can ea&s;ily excu&s;e my judgment that office. I hope it will never be called to it."</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="036127_0130_10084FE59C006560">"You will be the happier. But, educated as you and I have been, in the &s;ame &s;chool, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, I have no doubt, but our conduct would be the &s;ame."</P>
<P>"It is ea&s;ier to admire than to imitate you. All Ari&s;totle's pupils were not Alexanders."</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt, in who&s;e brea&s;t Ellen's agi|tation had rai&s;ed the mo&s;t painful apprehen&s;ions, had counted every moment &s;ince &s;he quitted him, with the mo&s;t anxious impatience: and no longer able to wait quietly her return, he had bent his &s;teps towards the par&s;onage. He met Ellen and Mary. From the fir&s;t glance of Ellen's eye, he learnt all he wi&s;hed to know. "A ble&s;&s;ing will follow all you do, my dear Ellen," &s;aid he; "for all you do is founded upon good &s;en&s;e and pro|priety."</P>
<P>"If I am right in your eyes, and not &s;elf-con|demned, I know not that there is any thing more in this world to be wi&s;hed for," &s;aid Ellen.</P>
<P>"You have, indeed, laid the be&s;t foundation for happine&s;s: and I entertain not a doubt but the &s;uper&s;tructure will be all our mo&s;t anxious love can de&s;ire."</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SIR WILLIAM received mr. Mordaunt's &s;um|mons to Groby Manor with a mixture of the mo&s;t lively plea&s;ure, and the mo&s;t tormenting &s;olicitude. He could not doubt of Ellen's determination in his favour: but he doubted the motives that had produced it. He had begun his attentions to her by a &s;crupulous weighing of her merits and ble|mi&s;hes: and he had ended in the mo&s;t decided and ardent pa&s;&s;ion. To be happy, he mu&s;t be be|loved, be beloved preferably, and almo&s;t exclu|&s;ively. To be le&s;s than all to Ellen, was, in &s;ir William's mind, to be little more than nothing. His vanity could &s;carcely hope, or his rea&s;on de&s;ire this: and yet le&s;s than this would by him, before marriage, be lamented as a misfortune, and after marriage be puni&s;hed as a fault.</P>
<P>He ha&s;ted down into Northumberland op|pre&s;&s;ed by doubt, yet too much in love to be di&s;|po&s;ed to be governed even by a confirmation of his doubts.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of Ellen increa&s;ed his love and his fears. He found her gentle, complacent, yielding:
<PB N="134" REF="036127_0132_10084FEC5CCD2B40">
but to all the &s;ymptoms of pa&s;&s;ion with which he was infected, he found nothing corre&s;pondent in Ellen. From the even tenor of her &s;pirits, and the perfect freedom in which he was convinced her choice had been left by her father, he could not &s;u&s;pect that &s;he was influenced in her accep|tance of him by any motives but &s;uch as &s;he avowed&mdash;a &s;en&s;e of his merits, and a conviction that her life would pa&s;s happily with him: but tho&s;e &s;entiments were far &s;hort of tho&s;e he wi&s;hed to in&s;pire. He had been told &s;he had loved Henry. She could therefore love. The anima|tion of character which &s;he di&s;played in all &s;he did, put the matter out of doubt. Her warmth of friend&s;hip for Mary, her attachment to her father, were farther proofs, if any had been wanting. Sir William already began to think it an injury to him, that, with the ardent feelings &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;eemed to grant him only e&s;teem.</P>
<P>To the querulous reproaches that &s;ometimes e&s;|caped him, Ellen oppo&s;ed at times a good hu|moured raillery; and at others, with a frank ho|ne&s;ty, would refer him to time and his own vir|tues, as the only grounds on which he could build the probable &s;ucce&s;s of his de&s;ires.</P>
<P>"And have you no notion of any love but what is grounded on the merits of the object?" Sir William would a&s;k.</P>
<P>"Certainly not."</P>
<P>"And do you never love but in exact propor|tion to tho&s;e merits?"</P>
<P>"I don't &s;ay &s;o," &s;aid Ellen, with a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>"And yet you refer me to my merits?"</P>
<P>"As the ground-work; that once laid, let me alone for the &s;uper&s;tructure."</P>
<P>"Is it not laid?" a&s;ked &s;ir William peevi&s;hly.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="036127_0133_10084FEDE4120240">"Without doubt: but hurrying me, will re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ard and not forward the building."</P>
<P>"Are you always &s;o tardy in works of love?"</P>
<P>"All my loves," &s;aid Ellen with emotion, have hitherto
<Q>'Grown with my growth, and &s;trengthened with my &s;trength.'</Q>
I am of &s;low capacity, and cannot &s;eize an idea the moment it is offered me. You mu&s;t not expect to reap before you have &s;own: but wait the &s;ea&s;on, and be a&s;&s;ured you &s;hall have a full harve&s;t."</P>
<P>So Ellen felt; and &s;o Ellen believed. She &s;aw much in &s;ir William to e&s;teem, and much to like. Every day he grew more intere&s;ting to her. The happine&s;s &s;he already began to feel, &s;he imputed to him. She did not trouble her&s;elf to analyze it too &s;crupulou&s;ly, nor to examine how much ought to be referred to the unbounded content that &s;hone in her father's countenance, how much to the new-born kindne&s;s of her mother, how much to the &s;atisfaction of her &s;i&s;ters, who &s;aw in her marriage the probable &s;phere of their plea&s;ures much enlarged. If &s;he adverted to any circum|&s;tance as making a part of her happine&s;s, inde|pendent of &s;ir William, it was a &s;elf gratulation on acting right, and a conviction that &s;he &s;hould not by her new connexions grieve Henry. She under&s;tood, as a certainty, that in a few months he was to return and marry lady Almeria. This circum&s;tance had not, 'tis true, made any part of her motives for her pre&s;ent conduct: but it was impo&s;&s;ible not to con&s;ider it as an addition to the per&s;onal happine&s;s &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf. The fear that in yielding &s;o implicitly to his father's will, he had been too carele&s;s of that felicity which
<PB N="136" REF="036127_0134_10084FF08E6180D8">
only can be &s;ecured by the wi&s;e choice of a partner for life, would &s;ometimes obtrude it&s;elf: but &s;he drove it from her.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umptuous in me, (thought &s;he), to de|cide a que&s;tion of which I know &s;o little. Lady Almeria may have all the virtues and perfections that I wi&s;h her to have. I hardly know her. Shall I, by judging her har&s;hly, make my&s;elf unhappy?</P>
<P>There were other uncertain thoughts and vague &s;u&s;picions, which &s;he found her&s;elf, when they occurred, le&s;s able to bani&s;h from her mind, and which touched her own intere&s;ts nearer.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome doubts of the goodne&s;s of &s;ir William's temper, and the liberality of his mind. She &s;carcely knew from what &s;uch &s;u&s;|picions aro&s;e; perhaps from a word or look to a &s;ervant, an opinion carele&s;sly dropped in common conver&s;ation, an over &s;olicitude for trifles, a &s;ome|thing falling &s;hort as it were of the thing &s;he wi&s;hed, rather than any thing directly inimical to it. She had to oppo&s;e to the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, the genero&s;ity and hand&s;omene&s;s with which &s;he knew he had dealt in all matters of &s;ettlement, and in all tran&s;actions with her father&mdash;the un|varied good-humour and &s;weetne&s;s of temper he di&s;played towards her&mdash;with the exception of what might be called the complainings of too ardent a love, an exception, which, however &s;he might lament it, &s;he hardly knew how to charge upon him as a fault.</P>
<P>To the&s;e were added, the gaiety and plea&s;ant|ne&s;s of his conver&s;ation, and his de&s;ire of accom|modation in all matters in which &s;he was con|cerned. Sometimes &s;he thought this a little &s;tu|died. But &s;he checked her&s;elf in what &s;he thought might be too great a fa&s;tidiou&s;ne&s;s: and &s;ome|times
<PB N="137" REF="036127_0135_10084FF21E32D1D8">
&s;he feared, that whatever idea aro&s;e in her mind to the di&s;advantage of &s;ir William, might be wholly owing to a compari&s;on, which, do what &s;he would, would &s;ometimes force it&s;elf upon her. When this thought occurred, &s;he condemned her|&s;elf as unju&s;t, and almo&s;t criminal: and &s;ir William was dearer to her from the &s;en&s;e of the injury &s;he thought &s;he had done him.</P>
<P>In a word, he had made that progre&s;s in her heart, and &s;he had &s;o accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to con&s;ider him as the per&s;on who was henceforth to be her be&s;t friend, that it depended wholly upon &s;ir William's &s;elf to &s;ecure her love and her happine&s;s for life.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, that lord Villars re|ceived the accounts of Ellen's intended marriage with the mo&s;t heart-felt &s;atisfaction: but it was a &s;atisfaction that he judged it expedient, at pre&s;ent, to conceal carefully from his &s;on. He imagined that he could never plead &s;uch an example of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly as in the moment when the final and certain overthrow of all his hopes &s;hould fill the brea&s;t of Henry with grief, di&s;ap|pointment, and probably re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Lord Villars entreated his &s;i&s;ter to keep Ellen as happy and plea&s;ed with her&s;elf as po&s;&s;ible, and by the mo&s;t marked change in her conduct to|wards her, and the mo&s;t unbounded approbation of her pre&s;ent de&s;igns, to make her, if po&s;&s;ible, forget the di&s;appointment of her love, in the gra|tification of her vanity. Hence the change of mrs. Mordaunt's behaviour to her daughter, in which the good heart of Ellen &s;o &s;incerely rejoiced.</P>
<P>Lord Villars wrote to mr. Mordaunt, be&s;eech|ing him to renew their intercour&s;e and friend&s;hip:
<PB N="138" REF="036127_0136_10084FF6E6083C90">
and mr. Mordaunt, who&s;e nature knew not im|placability, accepted the olive-branch. Lord Vil|lars ventured one &s;tep further; and &s;ent to Ellen, as a bridal pre&s;ent, a co&s;tly ornament of pearls.</P>
<P>Ellen felt this as an in&s;ult, as though her de&s;er|tion of Henry was to be paid with a pearl neck|lace. From the man who had &s;o unrelentingly refu&s;ed her happine&s;s, &s;he could not accept of ornament: and &s;he returned, with very civil ex|pre&s;&s;ions, the expen&s;ive trinket.</P>
<P>Sir William was acquainted with this circum|&s;tance: and Ellen &s;aw, with a very &s;en&s;ible pain, that it di&s;plea&s;ed him. He was more willing that &s;he &s;hould &s;acrifice the dignity of her mind, than that &s;he &s;hould betray any remaining re&s;entment to the per&s;on who had &s;eparated her from Henry.</P>
<P>But the thing was done, and could not be recalled. She endeavoured, however, to convince &s;ir William, that what &s;he had done, was not from a feeling of re&s;entment, but from that deli|cacy which forbids receiving obligation of any kind, and e&s;pecially of a pecuniary &s;ort, from tho&s;e of whom we think ill. And &s;he added, with a &s;oftne&s;s which ought to have &s;ubdued di&s;plea&s;ure, even ju&s;tly founded, that &s;he would have &s;acrificed even this delicacy, rather than have done what was unplea&s;ing to him.</P>

<P>WHILE the&s;e things were tran&s;acting in Northumberland, Henry was amu&s;ing him&s;elf extremely well in Italy, perfectly uncon&s;cious of the blow that awaited him. He had been ac|quainted with Ellen's journey to Bath, and had &s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel unea&s;ine&s;s as to the pro|bable con&s;equence of that expedition. But his heart had recovered its compo&s;ure, and re&s;umed its hopes, when he knew that &s;he was returned di&s;engaged into Northumberland. Although &s;e|parated by &s;eas and mountains, the &s;ame &s;atis|faction had filled the hearts of Henry and Ellen, on her being again &s;heltered, as they both hoped, by the &s;hades of Groby Manor, from the dangers of &s;olicitation, and &s;creened from the po&s;&s;ibility of notice.</P>
<P>This &s;helter had proved vain: and Henry now learnt, although indi&s;tinctly, and from doubtful authority, of Ellen's intended marriage with &s;ir William Ackland. On the thought of the di&s;|tance that divided Italy from England, an icy coldne&s;s ran through his veins. There was no &s;taying there in all the horror of uncertainty, to be made perhaps &s;till more wretched, by being put out of doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="036127_0138_10084FFC34F01020">He quitted Venice on the in&s;tant: and with a rapidity far &s;hort of his de&s;ires, but almo&s;t be|yond his powers, he arrived in England. Here he loitered not for information: but, more and more alarmed by that which reached him as he travelled on, with the &s;ame breathle&s;s ha&s;te he urged his way into Northumberland.</P>
<P>Here, at the par&s;onage, on the clo&s;e of a fine day, in September, the moon giving a more af|fecting tint to objects, the &s;ight of which, from the variety of emotions that they rai&s;ed, almo&s;t &s;hook his frame to di&s;&s;olution, arrived the wretched Henry.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked, in a voice &s;carcely articulate, for mr. and mrs. Thornton; and was told they were at Groby Manor. His informer was a female: and &s;he added, "for mi&s;s Ellen is to be married to-morrow: and my mi&s;tre&s;s is gone to take leave of her."</P>
<P>Henry felt the adder's f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g in his heart: and ca&s;ting up a look of de&s;pair, that rather &s;eemed to menace than to &s;upplicate, he ru&s;hed forward, and, unknowing what he did or what he meant to do, &s;oon reached the wood that adjoined to Groby Manor.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the few pen&s;ioners to whom Ellen's limited means enabled her to extend her bene|volence, was a poor woman, who, to the burden of four&s;core years, added infirmity and misfortune. To her nece&s;&s;ities Ellen had often &s;acrificed the variety of her dre&s;s, and the power of purcha&s;ing new books, or new mu&s;ic: and it was to Ellen not among&s;t the lea&s;t plea&s;ing circum&s;tances of her approaching marriage, that it would enable her to &s;ecure poor Deborah from all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of penury for the remainder of her life. No|thing,
<PB N="141" REF="036127_0139_10084FFEE5B75D70">
however, &s;eemed &s;ufficient to con&s;ole the old woman for the approaching lo&s;s of the daily vi&s;its of her beloved benefactre&s;s: and Ellen made it a point, not to remit her attentions while it was in her power to continue them.</P>
<P>The hurry of the preceding day had prevented her u&s;ual vi&s;it to Deborah: but as the cottage did not &s;tand more than five hundred yards from Groby Manor, ju&s;t on the out&s;ide of the wood, &s;he had withdrawn from her friends, while they were a&s;&s;embled at tea, to give one quarter of an hour to Deborah, to bid her adieu, and be&s;tow her parting bounty; for Ellen was to depart on the morrow.</P>
<P>She was returning from this humane vi&s;itation, &s;oftened by the gratitude and the ble&s;&s;ings of the poor creature &s;he had left, her mind full of pa&s;t &s;cenes, and future expectations, when on a &s;udden Henry's figure &s;tood before her.</P>
<P>Ellen neither &s;hrieked nor fainted. But &s;he doubted not but that which &s;he &s;aw was &s;uper|natural, 'till Henry, who, on the &s;ight of her, felt every tumultuous pa&s;&s;ion di&s;&s;olve into the mo&s;t melting tenderne&s;s, ru&s;hed forward and cla&s;ped her in his arms.</P>
<P>"Am I to believe my &s;en&s;es? are you indeed Henry?"</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, I am Henry, the forgotten Henry. I know I came unlooked for, unde&s;ired. But I come to claim my own; to &s;ave you from the &s;in of incon&s;tancy."</P>
<P>"Incon&s;tancy! Do you charge me with in|con&s;tancy?"</P>
<P>"Yes, thou dear fal&s;e one, yes. Can you deny the charge?"</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="036127_0140_100850021BB63530">"Mo&s;t confidently. But, dear Henry, com|po&s;e your&s;elf. What means this &s;udden appear|ance? What mean tho&s;e looks, &s;o eager and &s;o wild?"</P>
<P>"Are you not married?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"Are you not betrothed?"</P>
<P>"I be&s;eech you be calm. I will hear all you have to &s;ay. I will &s;atisfy you fully. But do not terrify me thus. You will drive my rea&s;on from her &s;eat."</P>
<P>"Do I terrify you? Forgive me? deare&s;t, be&s;t-beloved of creatures, forgive me. You talk of rea&s;on. Mine indeed is gone, is lo&s;t. Put your hand here, here&mdash;feel here. Do you not feel the burning chain with which my brain is bound?"</P>
<P>"We will &s;it down here. We will conver&s;e together. You cannot feel pain any where, Henry, that I &s;hall not commi&s;erate."</P>
<P>"How &s;oft is your voice! How kind your ac|cents! Oh, Ellen, you &s;hould not thus have un|done me."</P>
<P>A flood of tears &s;topt his &s;peech. He wept, concealing his face in Ellen's garment. She hung over him in unutterable di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ought to &s;ooth him by the kinde&s;t words of the mo&s;t heart-felt compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At length, he became more calm: and, &s;tarting up, "I meant not," &s;aid he, "to play the madman and the fool. But let us rea&s;on the matter to|gether. I will walk from you for a few moments; and having recovered my under&s;tanding, will try to keep it."</P>
<P>This was a &s;ea&s;onable relief to Ellen, and gave her time to rally all her faculties; for the &s;ight of
<PB N="143" REF="036127_0141_10085003A5ED4A20">
Henry, and Henry in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, had deprived her of every power of recollection, and made her &s;en&s;ible only to the extreme&s;t mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>"I think I &s;hall not again terrify you," &s;aid Henry, returning to her. "I think I can be ma&s;ter of my&s;elf. But, Ellen, I come to call you to a &s;evere account. I come to reckon with you for my ruin."</P>
<P>"How innocent I am of your ruin in act, or wi&s;h, I will not tell you, Henry; for you <HI>know.</HI> I will not tell you to turn your mind to pa&s;t tran&s;|actions. My exculpation, I am &s;ure, is written in your heart, and cannot be forgotten."</P>
<P>"Is it your exculpation, that you have &s;acri|ficed the true&s;t love to a vain ambition? Is it your exculpation, that from di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, pure as what angels feel, you are become &s;ordid, merce|nary?'</P>
<P>"Cruel Henry!&mdash;No, my dear cou&s;in, you are not cruel; you are not even mi&s;taken. You know I am not mercenary. You know I am not &s;ordid. You know me thoroughly; and can be at no lo&s;s for the real motives of my conduct."</P>
<P>"I know you thoroughly!&mdash;No, no.&mdash;Once indeed&mdash;"</P>
<P>"No retro&s;pect:&mdash;It is not only upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I have promi&s;ed to forbear it; and to give it is not only u&s;ele&s;s but detri|mental."</P>
<P>"Cool, rea&s;onable Ellen! But it is fal&s;e, di&s;|&s;embled. You &s;hall not per&s;uade me that you forget."</P>
<P>"I forget nothing. I &s;hould be &s;orry to lay the foundation of my duty in the lo&s;s of my fa|culties."</P>
<P>"And do you indeed remember? Deare&s;t
<PB N="144" REF="036127_0142_100850080A43CEC0">
creature, do you remember? It was in this walk, it was under the&s;e trees,&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Forbear. It was indeed in this &s;pot I fir&s;t acknowledged the preference I entertained for you; a preference ju&s;tified by a father's appro|bation. But here, al&s;o, I learnt that your father forbade a union, which it would be impious in you to form under his prohibition: and here, too, I &s;olemnly engaged I would never be acce&s;&s;ary to your di&s;obedience, and your ruin. Which of the&s;e recollections can criminate me in your eye, or ju&s;tify your pre&s;ent extravagance?"</P>
<P>"All, all may ju&s;tify my extravagance. That heart with all its virtues has been mine. It is torn from me&mdash;mo&s;t unju&s;tly torn from me&mdash; I have lo&s;t it for ever&mdash;Oh! Ellen, you bind me to the rack, and forbid me to complain!"</P>
<P>"Such complaint might have been pardonable twelve months ago. No future event can place a more in&s;urmountable bar between us than was my promi&s;e then given to your father. In that promi&s;e you then acquie&s;ced, why now&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Are you not about to be married to another&punc; Am I not to be for ever undone?"</P>
<P>"When I promi&s;ed your father never more to li&s;ten to you without his approbation, I knew I for ever renounced you. To-morrow's intended ceremony will not make the renunciation more ab&s;olute, then it then was. The duty of that moment was yielding: the duty of this is per|&s;everance."</P>
<P>"And you, madam, I find, are equal to both."</P>
<P>"You will not always, I hope, think that an ironical prai&s;e: and I &s;hall be happy to prove my&s;elf worthy of it."</P>
<P>They now walked on in &s;ilence&punc; when coming

to a walk that led immediately to the hou&s;e, Ellen turned into it, when ha&s;tily &s;eizing her gown, "you are not going?" exclaimed he.</P>
<P>"I am going no where," &s;aid &s;he mildly, "but where, if you plea&s;e, you may accompany me."</P>
<P>"Accompany you?&mdash;No, Ellen, I mu&s;t never accompany you. But may the God of all good accompany you. May he guard you &s;leeping, and ble&s;s your waking hours, and may you never more think of &s;uch a wretch as I am."</P>
<P>And then quitting his hold, he ru&s;hed into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;urrounding coppice, and was out of &s;ight in a moment.

<P>She was &s;tunned with his vehemence, and overcome by her own recollections. Her limbs &s;uddenly failed her: and &s;he &s;unk at the foot of a tree, nearly &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and wholly unable for &s;ome minutes either to act or to think&punc;</P>

<P>BUT the mind where rea&s;on is habitually pa|ramount, gives place but for a moment to the anarchy of the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Ellen rou&s;ed her&s;elf from the temporary &s;tupe|faction that had &s;eized her; and, ri&s;ing, returned with all the ha&s;te in her power to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Her ab&s;ence had already given occa&s;ion for &s;ur|pri&s;e and inquiry: and Mary had &s;ugge&s;ted, as its probable cau&s;e, a farewel vi&s;it to old Deborah.</P>
<P>It had, however, been protracted until it had produced a con&s;iderable degree of anxiety in the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who thought every moment of her ab&s;ence an hour.</P>
<P>Mary and &s;ir William were about to have come in &s;earch of her, when, from the windows of the room where they were, they &s;aw her approach. They ran towards her: and Mary, in accents of &s;olicitude, and &s;ir William in tho&s;e of reproach, eagerly enquired where &s;he had been.</P>
<P>"With Deborah, &s;aid Ellen: and in&s;tantly the tone of her voice betra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the emotion which &s;till agitated her, and which the di&s;compo&s;ure of her coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and the trembling of her limbs, made &s;till more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dent.</P>
<P>"Why, why would you go there?" &s;aid Mary&punc;
<PB N="147" REF="036127_0145_10085012362757A0">
"That poor creature's gratitude was &s;ure to be too much for you. How much better had it been that you had been playing and &s;inging with us."</P>
<P>"I will play and &s;ing with you now," &s;aid Ellen: and in a hurried and fluttered manner ha&s;tily &s;at down to the harp&s;ichord. She touched the keys: but it was di&s;cord, not harmony, that &s;he produced. Every eye was fixed upon her. Her father drew near with extreme anxiety: and &s;ir William, who had kept clo&s;e to her from the moment he had met her, &s;aid, with a tone of chagrin and reproach, "this vi&s;it to an old woman has &s;trangely di&s;compo&s;ed you."</P>
<P>"I am indeed extremely di&s;compo&s;ed," re|turned &s;he; and ri&s;ing, "my father, let me &s;peak to you."</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt, &s;truck with a deadly fear, though he knew not of what, put his arm round her wai&s;t &mdash; &s;he had need of the &s;upport&mdash;and withdrew with her into another room.</P>
<P>There a &s;ea&s;onable bur&s;t of tears relieved the almo&s;t bur&s;ting heart of Ellen. But recovered from this agitation, &s;he &s;ought to quiet, by a recital of every circum&s;tance, the agonizing alarm that, &s;he perceived, had &s;eized her father. The nar|rative, however, far from alleviating, increa&s;ed every apprehen&s;ion he had before felt. In it he thought he &s;aw the wreck of Ellen's happine&s;s, and in her happine&s;s that of her reputation. He thought he &s;aw the intended marriage with &s;ir William broken, and broken from a revived pa&s;|&s;ion for another man; a pa&s;&s;ion which ought to have been extingui&s;hed for ever before &s;uch a marriage had been thought of. But he knew not Ellen. He knew not, that the &s;evere&s;t &s;ufferings for another, fearle&s;s for her&s;elf, could not turn her

a&s;ide from the path of rectitude and rea&s;on. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aw her agitated, alarmed, and unhappy: and he di&s;tingui&s;hed not the &s;ource from whence tho&s;e feelings aro&s;e. He could not hope that it was alone pity and fear for Henry that excited them. He remained &s;ilent and thunder&s;truck, unknowing what to &s;ugge&s;t, or what to advi&s;e.</P>
<P>"Let me intreat you," &s;aid Ellen, "to go to mr. Thornton. Let him &s;eek out the wretched Henry. Let him, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ooth his de&s;pera|tion, and lead him to patience.</P>
<P>"And &s;ir William?&mdash;What &s;hall be &s;aid to &s;ir William?"</P>
<P>"I will tell him my&s;elf every thing."</P>
<P>"Tell him! What will you tell him?"</P>
<P>"All that has pa&s;&s;ed. I am &s;ure he will join in my commi&s;eration for the unhappy Henry."</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt felt his fears &s;ub&s;ide, and his hopes revive. "So untoward a circum&s;tance," &s;aid he he&s;itating, "may perhaps excite in &s;ir William's mind&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nothing but compa&s;&s;ion &s;urely. How other|wi&s;e can it affect &s;ir William? Have I ever di&s;avowed my affection to Henry? Have I ever pretended, that I renounced him from any con&s;i|deration but that of duty? The circum&s;tance of to-night has not altered the grounds of that re|nunciation. It has not &s;haken the e&s;teem, the love I have for &s;ir William. They were not founded upon the ab&s;ence of Henry, but upon the good qualities and kind affections of &s;ir Wil|liam. My de&s;igns and my &s;entiments are unal|tered. I will, indeed, confe&s;s my happine&s;s is con|&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened. I had been taught to believe that Henry too had &s;acrificed his fir&s;t love at the &s;hrine of filial duty. This belief did not form a
<PB N="149" REF="036127_0147_10085016967EF4F8">
motive for my own conduct: but it contributed largely to the happine&s;s I hoped to draw from it. I cannot be happy while Henry is &s;o perfectly wretched, and made &s;o by me. But had I known the true &s;tate of his mind &s;ome months ago, &s;hould I not &s;till have acted as I have done? I was not to hold my&s;elf accountable to him: and now I do know it, can it, ought it to have any influence on my actions?"</P>
<P>"My deare&s;t Ellen, you are every thing that a father can wi&s;h. You are every thing you ought to be."</P>
<P>"Go, dear &s;ir, go, and &s;end mr. Thornton in pur&s;uit of our poor wanderer; and beg &s;ir Wil|liam will come to me."</P>
<P>The agony of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and fear that &s;ir William had undergone during this conver&s;ation, no words can de&s;cribe; nor had the feelings of the re&s;t of the party been much le&s;s acute. On the return of mr. Mordaunt, they all crowded around him.</P>
<P>"Don't be alarmed, there is no harm.&mdash;Ellen has &s;een Henry. But go, my dear &s;ir Wil|liam. Go, and hear from her&s;elf all that has pa&s;&s;ed. There is nothing to be regretted in the affair but the mi&s;ery of poor Henry."</P>
<P>"Seen Henry!" repeated every voice, when mr. Mordaunt pronounced the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"Nothing to be regretted but the mi&s;ery of poor Henry!" &s;aid &s;ir William, and ru&s;hed ea|gerly into the room to which Ellen had retired.</P>
<P>She met him with her hand held out to him, "Come, my be&s;t friend, come, and with your kindne&s;s &s;ooth the agitation, that compa&s;&s;ion for the unhappy Henry has excited."</P>
<P>"Unhappy Henry!&mdash;Can he be called un|happy,

Ellen, who&s;e, &s;ufferings make your eyes overflow? and for who&s;e lo&s;s the bitterne&s;s of your regrets robs even your bridal hour of happi|ne&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Away with &s;uch a thought," &s;aid the upright Ellen: "if my heart did not &s;ink within me, if my whole frame were not di&s;compo&s;ed by having been witne&s;s of his di&s;tre&s;s, I &s;hould be unworthy of your e&s;teem or my own. Henry was my fir&s;t and, had not in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles interpo&s;ed, would have been my only choice. But when I bowed before tho&s;e ob&s;tacles, it was in a full and perfect &s;en&s;e, without any mental re&s;ervation, without any lurking hope whatever, that I &s;aid I renounced him. With equal &s;incerity, with equal &s;inglene&s;s of heart, I have avowed, that your merits and your affections have made &s;uch an im|pre&s;&s;ion on my mind, that, in con&s;enting to pa&s;s the whole of my life with you, I believe I have &s;ecured a pure and rational felicity for the remain|der of my days. The circum&s;tance of this night though it has clouded the &s;erenity of my mind, has made no alteration in its &s;entiments: and I &s;hall to-morrow become your wife with the &s;ame de&s;ires, with the &s;ame &s;atisfaction, the &s;ame affec|tions, and the &s;ame hopes, that I &s;hould have given you my hand ye&s;terday."</P>
<P>"In &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance you &s;eem to give me all I can a&s;k. Yet, how far &s;hort is &s;uch a modified regard, of the ardent and exclu&s;ive love I bear you."</P>
<P>"Be a&s;&s;ured," cried Ellen fervently, "that no love can be more exclu&s;ive than mine, if you mean to confine the &s;en&s;e of that word to the love that a wife ought to bear her hu&s;band. If
<PB N="151" REF="036127_0149_1008501CD992E000">
indeed you extend it to all the &s;olicitudes of friend|&s;hip, or family affection, know, that I never felt &s;uch a love. I am incapable of feeling &s;uch a love: and if I were con&s;cious of any tendencies towards it, I &s;hould think I ought to repre&s;s them. I can feel a preferable love, I cannot feel an exclu&s;ive one."</P>
<P>"You never felt &s;uch a love?"</P>
<P>"No. And the engagements that now &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us, is a proof of it. Had not a parent, had not my friends, had not my duties, had each their &s;hare in my heart, would tho&s;e ties ever have been broken, upon the di&s;&s;olution of which, tho&s;e that now &s;ub&s;i&s;t between you and me, have been founded."</P>
<P>"Oh, may I be able," cried &s;ir William, ten|derly embracing her, "to connect an ardent, if not an exclu&s;ive love for me, with all the energies of &s;uch a character, then &s;hall I be the mo&s;t ble&s;t of men."</P>
<P>"Doubt not, but you will do &s;o. Did I be|lieve otherwi&s;e, no con&s;ideration whatever would induce me to become your wife."</P>
<P>Sir William had then patience to li&s;ten to the circum&s;tances of Henry's &s;udden appearance and as &s;udden departure. He li&s;tened, but certainly with no compa&s;&s;ion corre&s;ponding to that felt by the relator; for, as he had a deeply-rooted fear of Henry's influence over the mind of Ellen, &s;o he was not without a feeling towards him &s;ome|thing re&s;embling hatred.</P>
<P>Ellen, though &s;he told all the truth, avoided, from a &s;entiment of delicacy, to pre&s;s u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ir William's ob&s;ervation the extent of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nry's wretchedne&s;s, and the &s;en&s;e &s;he had of it. And &s;ir William, though he &s;hrunk from every parti|cular

that repre&s;ented Ellen as tenderly touched for Henry, &s;hewed an eager curio&s;ity after the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tance that had pa&s;&s;ed. He &s;ought to draw &s;omething like cen&s;ure of the ve|hemence Henry had di&s;covered from the lips of Ellen. But this he &s;ought for in vain. The accents of the pure&s;t &s;incerity were ever on tho&s;e lips; nor did any imagined refinement of feeling ever betray her into the wanderings of duplicity: and &s;he felt only the mo&s;t lively and tender com|pa&s;&s;ion for the &s;orrows of Henry&punc; She knew &s;he had her&s;elf been deceived, as to the &s;tate of his mind; and had no doubt but that equal deceit had been practi&s;ed towards him, though the na|ture of the fal&s;hood was probably different. She could impute his indi&s;creet appearance, his vehe|mence, and his di&s;traction, only to his having been kept de&s;ignedly in ignorance of the real &s;ituation in which &s;he had been for &s;ome time pa&s;t, and from its having at length reached him in its full extent, and in &s;o &s;udden a manner, as to &s;u&s;pend for a time all the re&s;traints of rea&s;on and of pru|dence. All blame, therefore, was far from her mind; and never was anxiety more painful than that &s;he felt on his account.</P>
<P>Mr. Thornton at length returned. He in|formed her, that he had traced Henry back to his chai&s;e, which (his &s;ervants not having received any orders from him) had waited at the par&s;onage, from the moment he quitted it until he returned; that having put him&s;elf into it, he had driven back to the next inn, where, changing hor&s;es, he had again pur&s;ued his journey, evidently with a de&s;ign to e&s;cape as &s;oon as he could, from a place which overwhelmed him with recollections he was unable to bear.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="036127_0151_1008502278A49858">Ellen could not hope to hear any thing more con&s;olatory. Yet the idea of Henry a fugitive, under the guidance only of his ungoverned pa&s;|&s;ions, flying from her, and &s;uffering for her, fixed a pain in her heart, which no con&s;iderations on the rectitude of her own conduct, or the probable pro&s;pect of happine&s;s before her could remove. Her be&s;t balm would have been a frank and tender participation in her &s;orrows by &s;ir William. It would have been, on his part, the &s;ure&s;t means of avoiding the evil he dreaded. But &s;he beheld him with regret and apprehen&s;ion, gloomy and &s;ilent. His attention towards her wore rather the air of &s;u&s;picion than of tenderne&s;s; and &s;eemed to &s;ugge&s;t to her the propriety of conceal|ing feelings, which &s;he could not but con&s;ider, not only as unavoidable, but laudable.</P>
<P>The evening wore away with little &s;atisfaction on any &s;ide: and Ellen retired to her apartment with a fear for the peace of her future life; which not the &s;udden appearance of Henry, not tho&s;e recollections which it had awakened in her, but the di&s;po&s;itions which it &s;eemed to have betrayed in &s;ir William, had impre&s;&s;ed on her mind.</P>
<P>When Ellen appeared at breakfa&s;t the next morning, her countenance wore an air of thought|fulne&s;s, which no one in her pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances could reprove: but &s;he had endeavoured, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to bani&s;h all &s;adne&s;s from it. The gay affection that &s;parkled in &s;ir William's eyes, and the ardent love with which they were darted towards her, did more, in one in&s;tant, towards producing this effect, than all her reflec|tions and re&s;olutions, formed through a &s;leeple&s;s night, had been able to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="036127_0152_100850259A4BDB78">"Forgive, my deare&s;t love, forgive," &s;aid &s;ir William, "all that la&s;t night might look like di&s;tru&s;t, or di&s;content, on my part. My feelings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight perhaps condemn, but my judgment wholly acquitted you: and who that knows the real value of my Ellen's heart, will wonder, that a fear, how|ever unju&s;tly &s;ounded, that it was not wholly mine, &s;hould overwhelm me with &s;adne&s;s?"</P>
<P>"My dear &s;ir William, only do your&s;elf ju&s;|tice; and you will never have any fear concerning my heart, that can give you a moment's unea&s;i|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>Sir William, delighted, embraced her: and Ellen's almo&s;t lo&s;t hope, that the road, which her rea&s;on had pointed out to her, as &s;ure to lead to happine&s;s, began to revive.</P>
<P>The marriage ceremony was performed by mr. Thornton. Mrs. Thornton and her daughter attended their beloved Ellen to church; and there they parted. The pain of this parting &s;cene was mitigated on all &s;ides, by a firm promi&s;e on the part of the Thorntons, that many months &s;hould not elap&s;e, before they vi&s;ited Berk&s;hire.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO Oakley, Ellen began her journey: but in the &s;ituation of this country re&s;idence of &s;ir Wil|liam's, there was one circum&s;tance, which &s;ince the adventure of the preceding day, Ellen had ad|verted to with pain.</P>
<P>Oakley was &s;ituated &s;carcely half a mile di&s;tant from the &s;mall hou&s;e belonging to lord Villars, to which he had retired on the death of his &s;on. It was not the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the family: but &s;he knew it was a favourite &s;pot with Henry, and a place to which he frequently re&s;orted, to pur&s;ue the &s;ports of the field. She could not hope that he would &s;oon be able to &s;ee her with the com|po&s;ure, without which he ought not to &s;ee her at all: and &s;he felt hurt at being the cau&s;e of ba|ni&s;hing him from a place, where, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of his mind, he might probably have found the mo&s;t eligible retreat from the di&s;traction and regrets that preyed upon his heart. She feared his re&s;ource might be again to quit England: and in this continued e&s;trangement from his country and family, &s;he fore&s;aw a probable change in his character and manner of thinking, extremely to the di&s;advantage of his happine&s;s and principles. She knew him formed to be an u&s;eful and active member of &s;ociety, capable of fulfilling, with ho|nour to him&s;elf and advantage to others, any civil
<PB N="156" REF="036127_0154_1008502B93412B30">
or political duty, which his rank in life, or the circum&s;tances of his country might call him to. To have him wa&s;te his exi&s;tence in wandering from one foreign court to another, di&s;tant from every dome&s;tic and every national connection, a prey to u&s;ele&s;s repining, or the victim of frivolous plea&s;ures, was an idea that filled her mind with the mo&s;t painful di&s;quietude&mdash;a di&s;quietude that aro&s;e almo&s;t beyond endurance, when &s;he ventured to a&s;k her&s;elf the que&s;tion, "What has driven him to this?"</P>
<P>Sir William ob&s;erved, with chagrin, her anxiety, and the &s;olicitude with which &s;he de&s;ired to hear &s;omething of Henry. But in every other particular he had rea&s;on to think him&s;elf the mo&s;t fortunate of men.</P>
<P>The charms of Ellen's per&s;on and conver&s;ation, the &s;weetne&s;s of her temper, and the unfeigned affection that her every action manife&s;ted towards him, left him nothing to wi&s;h, had he known how to regulate his wi&s;hes by the rule of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But, in fact, &s;ir William was neither rea&s;onable nor amiable. Under all the exterior graces which a plea&s;ing per&s;on, poli&s;hed manners, and a good and cultivated under&s;tanding could be&s;tow, he was vehement in his temper, and, when thoroughly provoked, implacable. Lavi&s;h in pur&s;uit of his own gratifications, niggardly in promoting tho&s;e of others; he loved Ellen with all the ardency of pa&s;&s;ion; but he loved her as a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in which he could not bear that any other &s;hould have a &s;hare. The mildne&s;s of her manners and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of her conduct, with the com|placent &s;tate of mind that belongs to a &s;ucce&s;sful lover, had pre&s;erved him, during his re&s;idence in Northumberland, from every po&s;&s;ibility of betray|ing
<PB N="157" REF="036127_0155_1008502E13000B50">
his natural di&s;po&s;ition: and without de&s;igning to practi&s;e any deception, &s;ir William Ackland, in the fir&s;t months of Ellen's knowledge of him, and &s;ir William Ackland during the re&s;t of his life, were two men, of di&s;tinct and &s;eparate cha|racters.</P>
<P>It was, however, only &s;lowly, and by degrees, that the true and unamiable character was di&s;|clo&s;ed to the unwilling ob&s;ervation of Ellen: and it was not until every doubt was done away, in the mo&s;t calamitous certainty, that Ellen would allow her&s;elf to believe, that the man who could appear rea&s;onable, obliging, kind, and generous, was, in truth, unper&s;uadeable, har&s;h, violent, and &s;elfi&s;h. But the di&s;covery was not yet made. The pre&s;ent hour was all harmony: and the brighte&s;t pro&s;pects opened before her.</P>
<P>She was joined by the family, from Groby Manor, at the time appointed: and &s;he learnt, with a &s;atisfaction that bani&s;hed all &s;adne&s;s from her mind, that Henry had &s;ignified his de&s;ign to his father of taking up his abode in England. He was at pre&s;ent engaged in making an excur&s;ion to the North of Scotland: bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had promi&s;ed to join his father at the park at Chri&s;tmas.</P>
<P>In truth, however vehement and re&s;tle&s;s Henry might have been, while his mind was divided be|tween hope and fear, and while inaction on his part might be acce&s;&s;ary to the lo&s;s of his happi|ne&s;s; he had no &s;ooner recovered from the pa|roxy&s;m of grief and de&s;pair, into which the con|&s;ummation of his misfortune had thrown him, than he rou&s;ed all the faculties of his mind to bear with the con&s;tancy and dignity of a rational creature, griefs which no impatience or extrava|gance could in any way le&s;&s;en.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="036127_0156_1008502FF8AC3D60">Of Ellen's per&s;on and Ellen's character he was enamoured. He looked round; and in his idea &s;aw nothing equal to her on earth: and he felt, that however impelled by pa&s;&s;ion, or mi&s;led by fancy, he might in any future hour be tempted to form a temporary engagement with another woman, that there was no other whom the &s;anc|tion of his judgment could allow as worthy to &s;ucceed Ellen in his affections as a wife; lea&s;t of all could the frivolous, the incon&s;equent lady Al|meria be worthy. He con&s;idered her, too, as the efficient cau&s;e that had &s;eparated him from Ellen: and if to other woman he were indifferent, to lady Almeria he was abhorrent.</P>
<P>But in re&s;olving that no con&s;ideration &s;hould ever compel him to accept of her as a wife, he wi&s;hed to &s;often the obduracy of his oppo&s;ition to his father's will as much as po&s;&s;ible. It was in this light that he turned with di&s;approbation from the idea that had once appeared &s;educing to him, of living like a vagabond upon earth, wandering from place to place, and finding no where a home.</P>
<P>"I have a home, I have a family, I have a country," &s;aid he, "deare&s;t Ellen: with what delight, animated by your approbation, &s;hould I have endeavoured to have fulfilled my duties to them all. Your love mu&s;t no longer be my re|ward. But your virtue &s;hall be my &s;timulator. Your eye &s;hall follow me through life: and it &s;hall not weep for the degeneracy of your cou&s;in."</P>
<P>Three days after the marriage of Ellen, Henry was &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter of him&s;elf to form this re|&s;olution, and to write the following letter in con|&s;equence of it to his father.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>I will be now no hu&s;band, my lord. But, with this exception, I will endeavour to be every thing that your lord&s;hip can de&s;ire. If I am taught to hope, that upon this condition I may be allowed to re&s;ume my place in your family, and to parti|cipate in the ble&s;&s;ings of dome&s;tic &s;ociety, I will rather endeavour to find a balm for my griefs in the &s;crupulous di&s;charge of my duty to my rela|tions and country, than &s;eek an a&s;ylum in &s;ome foreign land, where, buried from all ob&s;ervation, I once intended, I and my &s;orrows &s;hould be mentioned no more.

<P><PB N="160" REF="036127_0158_10085036685E6190">My re&s;olutions are not to be &s;haken: nor will I, by allowing of the apparent po&s;&s;ibility of my wavering, be acce&s;&s;ary to any prolongation of hope in the brea&s;t of your lord&s;hip, or of any other intere&s;ted in my deci&s;ion, which mu&s;t end in di&s;appointment.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Lord Villars had been appri&s;ed of Henry's in|terview with Ellen, and the de&s;peration that he had manife&s;ted; and his mind had been filled with the mo&s;t lively apprehen&s;ions in con&s;equence. There was no extremity that he had not feared Henry might be driven to: and therefore the con|tents of this letter relieved him from a &s;tate of mo&s;t painful anxiety.</P>
<P>At the in&s;tant it was written he could expect
<PB N="161" REF="036127_0159_10085038E4B6C5F0">
nothing le&s;s than a formal renunciation of the whole &s;ex for Ellen's &s;ake: but lord Villars little feared that a man of Henry's years, and Henry's di&s;po&s;ition, would turn hermit. His de&s;ire of be|ing upon amicable terms with his father, and his purpo&s;e of continuing in England, per&s;uaded lord Villars that time might yet produce all the effects he wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>He readily promi&s;ed, that neither lady Almeria nor any other woman &s;hould be offered to his ac|ceptance, and manife&s;ted the mo&s;t parental con|cern for his pre&s;ent &s;ufferings. "Sufferings," he &s;aid, "which made his own heart bleed, and which nothing but the mo&s;t cruel nece&s;&s;ity could ever have induced him to have inflicted on a &s;on, whom he loved as he did his own &s;oul."</P>
<P>Promi&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions co&s;t lord Villars noth|ing. They were equally for the pre&s;ent moment, without reference for the pa&s;t, or thought of the future. He knew, indeed, how, by the colour|ing he could give to any after events, to "keep his promi&s;e to the ear, and break it to the &s;en&s;e." He de&s;ired Henry to come directly to the park, where, whatever lord Villars did, lady Villars longed to &s;ee him. Henry had accordingly made them a vi&s;it of a few days; but at the expiration of that time had gone upon a tour into the High|lands, hoping by the means of a variety of objects, and con&s;tant change of place, a little to blunt the edge of tho&s;e remembrances, which, while they pre&s;erved their pre&s;ent acutene&s;s, were, at mo|ments, more that his rea&s;on and his fortitude could &s;upport.</P>

<Q>I knew a wench married in an afternoon, as &s;he went to the garden for par&s;ley, to &s;tuff a rabbit; and &s;o may you.
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LORD VILLARS and his family had been among&s;t &s;ome of Ellen's fir&s;t vi&s;itors. From the offen&s;ive flattery and &s;tudied fondne&s;s of lord Vil|lars, &s;he could not but turn with undi&s;gui&s;ed aver&s;ion: but in the friend&s;hip and partiality of lady Villars &s;he experienced a very &s;incere plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Lady Villars had no very clear idea of the whole merit of Ellen's conduct: but &s;he thought her&s;elf under important obligations to her for the readine&s;s with which &s;he had quitted her rights to a connexion with her &s;on; a connexion, which lady Villars hone&s;tly believed, would have been attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences to her whole family.</P>
<P>Lady Villars, therefore, rejoiced in Ellen's pre|&s;ent &s;ituation, as in what &s;he thought a due re|ward for the generous &s;elf denial &s;he had practi&s;ed in her conduct towards Henry. But when &s;he &s;aw with what propriety Ellen &s;upported the rank of life in which &s;he was placed, how &s;he adorned and animated &s;ociety, and how &s;he conciliated the affections of all who approached her, &s;he could hardly repre&s;s a regret that any con&s;ideration, however powerful, &s;hould have &s;tood in her way,
<PB N="163" REF="036127_0161_1008503F5563BD10">
to the &s;ecuring to her&s;elf &s;uch a daughter, and her &s;on &s;uch a wife.</P>
<P>With lord and lady Villars come lady Almeria. From lady Villars, who&s;e integrity forbade her concurring in any deception, &s;he had learnt the contents of Henry's letter. She therefore knew that her brows were bound with willow: but her heart &s;eemed not the le&s;s light for this. She rattled, laughed, danced, rode, and walked with the gaye&s;t and happie&s;t of her companions; made a je&s;t of Henry's cruelty; and rallied Ellen on her charms, which lo&s;t no part of their a&s;cendency even over a haple&s;s lover. Ellen's gravity upon &s;uch occa&s;ions would have taught any one but the in&s;en&s;ible lady Almeria re&s;erve upon this &s;ubject. But lady Almeria had a love of mi&s;chief in her di&s;po&s;ition, which no con&s;ideration for another was &s;ufficient to check her in the gratification of: and though &s;he had no plea&s;ure in tormenting Ellen, &s;he thought it good &s;port to make &s;ir Wil|liam jealous.</P>
<P>To a wild girl of little more than &s;eventeen, &s;ir William, at pa&s;t forty, &s;eemed a Methu&s;alem, and &s;he thought it comical to make the old gentleman (as &s;he called him) knit his brow and pout, by talk|ing of the love and the merit of his young rival.</P>
<P>Lady Villars would have repre&s;&s;ed this imper|tinence. But lady Almeria was incorrigible: for, joined to no common degree of incon&s;ideration, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of her importance to the family, and was not uncon&s;cious, that in &s;pite of the pre|&s;ent coldne&s;s of Henry, lord Villars had not re|&s;igned his hopes of making her one day his daugh|ter-in-law.</P>
<P>She therefore often treated both lord and lady Villars with a kind of civil in&s;olence; and very
<PB N="164" REF="036127_0162_10085040DC91FAE8">
openly a&s;&s;erted her right of having her own way in every thing. She did not want talents, nor di&s;cernment: and &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed lady Villars as much for the narrowne&s;s of her under&s;tanding, as &s;he did lord Villars for the &s;ordidne&s;s of his views.</P>
<P>Lord Villars tolerated all this in con&s;ideration of the number of her e&s;tates. But lady Villars &s;oon conceived a decided di&s;like to her, and a deep-rooted fear of her ever becoming the wife of her &s;on. This di&s;like and this fear were ren|dered more lively by the compari&s;on &s;he daily made between her character and that of Ellen.</P>
<P>But lord Villars' hopes and lady Villars' fears were alike unfounded; and were one proof more, added to the thou&s;ands that occur every day, that, if the &s;ufferings of life were to be confined to actual misfortunes, the mountain of human woes, which now &s;eems &s;o immen&s;e, and extended, would &s;hrink into a mole-hill, of a &s;ize &s;o &s;mall as almo&s;t to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation. It is, however, in&s;eparable from our nature, that our &s;ufferings &s;hall be more from what we fear, than from what we feel: and in reckoning the &s;orrows attached to our exi&s;tence here, we are to e&s;timate not what is, but what it is apprehended may be.</P>
<P>Among the joyous circle that Ellen on her marriage had drawn round her at Oakley, her brother was not forgotten.</P>
<P>He had continued under the private tuition where mr. Mordaunt had placed him on his return from Jamaica, until of a &s;ufficient age to be &s;ent to college: and at eighteen he had been removed to Oxford.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt dreading the influence of his wife on the character of his &s;on, had &s;uffered him to &s;pend as little time as po&s;&s;ible at Groby Manor,
<PB N="165" REF="036127_0163_100850436F595680">
while he continued a &s;chool boy; and after his removal to Oxford, had continued &s;o to fill up his vacations with &s;ome plea&s;urable &s;cheme or other, as almo&s;t totally to bani&s;h him from thence, with|out any appearance of de&s;ign or unkindne&s;s. But he was now grown to manhood: and precautions of this kind were no longer po&s;&s;ible or nece&s;&s;ary; nor could mr. Mordaunt any longer refu&s;e him&s;elf the &s;atisfaction of a&s;&s;ociating with his &s;on, e&s;pe|cially as he flattered him&s;elf, that his own opinions might probably now have more influence over him than tho&s;e of his mother.</P>
<P>William Mordaunt had now therefore joined the family party at Oakley. He was hand&s;ome, gay, and good-humoured: but he was wild, in|con&s;iderate, and ungovernable.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria and he were drawn towards each other, by a &s;ympathy of character and di&s;po&s;ition. From the fir&s;t hour of their acquaintance, they became in&s;eparable: and lord Villars &s;aw that if he did not find &s;ome immediate remedy for this impending evil, lady Almeria's fortune would be lo&s;t to his family for ever.</P>
<P>He had recour&s;e to his u&s;ual means, delay.</P>
<P>He laid before lady Almeria the inequality and degradation of the connexion that &s;he &s;eemed di&s;|po&s;ed to form; and declared, that while &s;he was under his direction, neither his honour nor his con&s;cience would permit him to &s;uffer it.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria li&s;tened in &s;ilence, and with an in&s;olent non-chalance, to his lecture: and when he had ended it, twi&s;ting her &s;a&s;h ribband round her arm, as &s;he went out of the room, replied between her teeth, "We mu&s;t wait until I am one-and-twenty then."</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="036127_0164_10085046CFCEC0C0">If lady Almeria would but wait, it was all lord Villars could dare to hope from her: and from his own machinations during this period of expec|tation, he was to look for what further was wanting, to his &s;ucce&s;s. From his u&s;ual coad|jutrice, mrs. Mordaunt, he could not in this ca&s;e expect any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for however de&s;irous &s;he might be to promote the intere&s;ts of her nephew, in general, when they came in competition with tho&s;e of her &s;on, they could not be expected to have any but a &s;econd place. She had &s;een the growing fondne&s;s between him and lady Almeria; and had &s;ecretly re&s;olved to do all in her power to forward it. It had been ob&s;erved by mr. Mor|daunt with very different wi&s;hes and views: but he wi&s;ely thought a &s;eeming inattention to what was going on, the mo&s;t likely method of pre|venting a fancy from growing into a prejudice: and he imagined, if his &s;on were nor led by op|po&s;ition into making engagements with him&s;elf, not to give up lady Almeria, that the pre&s;ent par|tiality would probably end in a boy and girl's &s;hort-lived flirtation, without any farther con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>But the precipitancy of lady Almeria's pa&s;&s;ions rendered the plans of hindrance on the part of lord Villars and mr. Mordaunt, and tho&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance on the part of mrs. Mordaunt, equally vain and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria had li&s;tened to lord Villars with the mo&s;t apparent indifference: but this did not ari&s;e from her being carele&s;s as to his oppo&s;ition to her de&s;igns, but from her re&s;olution, that all op|po&s;ition from whatever quarter &s;hould prove vain.</P>
<P>She went directly from lord Villars to William
<PB N="167" REF="036127_0165_1008504948834688">
Mordaunt. She found him practi&s;ing archery with &s;ome of his companions.</P>
<P>"Come along with me," &s;aid &s;he, "I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you. Guardy," (for &s;o &s;he was accu&s;tomed in contempt to call lord Villars) "Guardy," &s;aid &s;he, when they were alone, "has been fulminating his interdict again&s;t my becom|ing your wife. Neither his honour nor his con|&s;cience, for&s;ooth, can allow of &s;o unequal a con|nection. That is, his honour de&s;igns to give my per&s;on to his &s;on, who cares not a pin for me; and his con&s;cience appropriates my fortune as the provi&s;ion for his younger children. But if I and my money are to go to ruin, they &s;hall go my own way. He will not find me &s;o &s;oon moralized and &s;entimentalized out of my rights as he found your &s;i&s;ter Ellen. What &s;ay you? Are you inclined to tru&s;t my con&s;tancy through all the battleings and all the temptations with which it will be a&s;|&s;aulted in the next four years? Or will you make &s;hort work of it, and meet me with a chai&s;e and four at the corner of the park wall, at one in the morning, and away to Scotland, and let guardy try, with all his bay and brown coach hor&s;es, to overtake us?"</P>
<P>"To night! this moment! in the face of the &s;un, in &s;pite of all the guardians and all the coach hor&s;es in the world."</P>
<P>"That would be &s;pirited; but no. We &s;hould have &s;colding, and hectoring, and locking up, and the lord knows what. I think I could be a match for them there too; but I hate unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, and have no de&s;ire to play the part of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed dam&s;el. Let us do the matter quietly, at one, by the &s;ilent light of the moon. O lord, it does not &s;hine: but no matter, the &s;tars will do as well.
<PB N="168" REF="036127_0166_1008504BE67E7248">
I will be punctual to the minute. If you are out of ca&s;h I can &s;upply you. I received my quar|terage two days ago, and having paid no bills, it is luckily entire."</P>
<P>"Well, be it &s;o; at one exactly."</P>
<P>"To a &s;econd. There's my hand upon it. And now let us go to our aunts, and our uncles, and our cou&s;ins, and our guardians, and behave prettily, as a good little ma&s;ter and mi&s;s ought to do: and we may laugh at them the more when we are by our&s;elves."</P>
<P>And thus, in le&s;s than ten minutes did the&s;e two thoughtle&s;s creatures determine upon a &s;tep upon which all the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of their future lives depended.</P>
<P>William found no difficulty in engaging a chai&s;e and four to be at the appointed &s;pot, at the hour fixed upon; nor lady Almeria any in di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing her maid before &s;he was undre&s;&s;ed; nor, when &s;he was gone, in wrapping her&s;elf up in her furs, and, with a &s;mall bundle of linen in her hand, de&s;cending the &s;tairs, opening the door into the garden, or in proceeding from thence to the park, or, finally, in keeping her appointment with William.</P>
<P>At the corner of the park wall &s;he found him; he received her with all the gaiety of youth, and all the raptures of a lover; they put them&s;elves into the chai&s;e together, and before lady Almeria was mi&s;&s;ed in the morning, had proceeded too far on their way to Scotland, to give any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s from a pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Whatever confu&s;ion the di&s;covery of their flight might occa&s;ion in the family at Oakley, or what|ever inward vexation it cau&s;ed lord Villars, who thus &s;aw a final end to all his ambitious projects,
<PB N="169" REF="036127_0167_1008504DA1B65F00">
yet the nearne&s;s of the connexion in all the indi|viduals who compo&s;ed that family, prevented any violent di&s;play of di&s;appointment or chagrin. Lord Villars thought proper to glo&s;s over the matter with an a&s;&s;urance, that although the re&s;pect he had for the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by lady Al|meria's father, would have prevented his con&s;ent|ing to &s;uch a match, yet the regard that he enter|tained for the intere&s;ts of his nephew, made him, &s;ince it had been concluded without his concur|rence, &s;incerely rejoice in it.</P>
<P>With an air of acting under the&s;e feelings, he made, though &s;omething with an ill grace, his congratulations to mr. Mordaunt: and mr. Mor|daunt, with infinitely more &s;incerity, a&s;&s;ured him, that had the connexion depended upon him, it had never taken place: and indeed the deep &s;igh, that the reflection upon the mi&s;ery that an ill-judged marriage can occa&s;ion drew from him, evinced, that neither the &s;plendour of lady Almeria's birth, or the greatne&s;s of her for|tune, compen&s;ated, in his opinion, for the light|ne&s;s of her mind and the unfeelingne&s;s of her heart.</P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction, however, of mrs. Mordaunt, who judged very differently, knew no bounds: and lady Villars could not help joining (though from very different motives) in her plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The fate of lord Villars upon this occa&s;ion, was peculiarly hard. While half the world called his hone&s;ty in que&s;tion, for having &s;acrificed the in|tere&s;ts of his ward to tho&s;e of his nephew; the other half arraigned his prudence, in &s;uffering &s;uch a prize to go out of his own family; the&s;e cen&s;ures were equally unfounded. He had &s;pared
<PB N="170" REF="036127_0168_1008505041458020">
no pains to pre&s;erve lady Almeria from his ne|phew: he had left no art une&s;&s;ayed to &s;ecure her for his &s;on.</P>
<P>This event affected Ellen very &s;en&s;ibly. She could not but be plea&s;ed that Henry was relieved from all per&s;ecution on lady Almeria's account, and that he was &s;afe from the po&s;&s;ibility of yield|ing to it. But the very unfavourable opinion &s;he had of lady Almeria's character, and which a farther knowledge of her had confirmed, filled her mind with the mo&s;t lively apprehen&s;ions for the happine&s;s of her brother.</P>
<P>The young couple, however, were welcomed on their return from Scotland, without much re|proach on any &s;ide. The nece&s;&s;ary arrangements of their e&s;tabli&s;hment were made: and harmony &s;eemed re&s;tored to all the parties concerned.</P>
<P>Another event, which happened in the family of Ellen, at this time, occa&s;ioned much more &s;erious con&s;ternation and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mordaunt had long had the mortification of being witne&s;s to the mi&s;ery and poverty of her elde&s;t daughter. No one reproached her as the cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but, notwith&s;tanding her natural indif|ference to every &s;orrow that did not attack her per&s;onally, &s;he could not avoid making her&s;elf the mo&s;t &s;evere reproaches. She now &s;aw the fatal con&s;ummation of her ill-laid plans of ambition and vanity. The mi&s;erable daughter was returned upon their hands. The unprincipled man, whom &s;he had cho&s;en for her hu&s;band, having collected the remnants of his ruined fortune, had left his wife and two children to beggary, and had quitted England, as he &s;aid, for ever.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt was little able to bear this
<PB N="171" REF="036127_0169_10085053B19B2860">
additional burden. There was however no al|ternative. His daughter and her children were &s;tarving. Groby Manor was the only a&s;ylum open to them: to Groby Manor, there|fore, after a vi&s;it of three months to Ellen, mr. Mordaunt conducted his wife and the re&s;t of his family.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ELLEN and &s;ir William were now left alone: and Ellen had lei&s;ure to look around her and con|&s;ider the duties and engagements which her new &s;ituation called her to the performance of.</P>
<P>In the &s;cheme of happine&s;s, which, in con&s;ent|ing to a marriage with &s;ir William Ackland, &s;he had planned for her&s;elf, a very prominent feature had been the regular and &s;y&s;tematic a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he &s;hould be able to admini&s;ter to the wants, both of mind and e&s;tate, of her poor neighbours. In the fullne&s;s of her benevolent &s;elf-gratulation, &s;he had &s;aid, "when the ear hears me, it &s;hall ble&s;s me: when the eye &s;ees me, it &s;hall give witne&s;s to me. The ble&s;&s;ing of him who is ready to peri&s;h, &s;hall come upon me: and I will cau&s;e the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy."</P>
<P>In her imagination, &s;he educated the young, &s;he encouraged the middle-aged, and &s;he &s;up|ported the old. She &s;aw the neat cottage ari&s;e at her command; the orderly arranged bee-hive re&s;t again&s;t the wall, a &s;ource at once of plea&s;ure and of profit; the little flower plat put forth its beau|ties; the orchard yield its fruits, and the virtues of integrity and indu&s;try <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead content, health and affluence in their train.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="036127_0171_1008505AADA3BF10">Such were the vi&s;ions that filled the mind of Ellen, who, wholly in&s;en&s;ible to every happine&s;s &s;he could not communicate, thought &s;he placed her own felicity on the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is, when &s;he ex|tended it to others.</P>
<P>Such were the vi&s;ions which had filled the mind of Ellen before her marriage: and amid&s;t the hur|ried and bu&s;y &s;cenes which had held her almo&s;t wholly engaged in what appeared more per&s;onally to concern her&s;elf for the fir&s;t three months after it took place, &s;he had by no means lo&s;t &s;ight of them.</P>
<P>In all her excur&s;ions in the environs of Oakley, &s;he had looked around her with reference to the favourite object that filled her mind. She had endeavoured to make &s;ome enquiry into the &s;i|tuation of the cottagers, and to form an acquaint|ance with the poore&s;t of her neighbours. But &s;he found difficulties that had never occurred to her imagination.</P>
<P>The long re&s;idence of &s;ir William abroad, and the character of his immediate ance&s;tors, who had &s;pent little of their time at their principal country re&s;idence, and who had be&s;towed le&s;s of their thoughts upon the wants and claims of the poor who &s;urrounded it, had long occa&s;ioned Oakley to be forgotten by the di&s;ea&s;ed and the nece&s;&s;itous; and had made its owners to be con&s;idered as hard and &s;elfi&s;h people of fa&s;hion, who regarded their e&s;tate no farther than as it could furni&s;h the &s;up|ply to their plea&s;ures or their vices. There were no old &s;ervants to whom Ellen could apply for information, how to direct her benevolence. Her hou&s;ehold con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;et of dome&s;tics whom &s;ir William had collected upon his marriage, all
<PB N="174" REF="036127_0172_1008505C550ABBE8">
&s;trangers to that neighbourhood, and indifferent to its intere&s;ts. The &s;teward was a man whom &s;ir William had brought out of Wales, profe&s;&s;edly that he &s;hould have no predilection for any of tho&s;e with whom he would have to deal. Sir William knew as little of the re&s;idents on his e&s;tate, as any of his dependants, farther than if they paid their rents well or ill: and whenever Ellen endeavoured to lead him to think upon the &s;ubject, or to open her own plans, he either re|pre&s;&s;ed her by a look of di&s;approbation, or laughed her out of countenance, on the ta&s;te &s;he had of becoming a lady Bountiful.</P>
<P>Ellen willingly imputed this backwardne&s;s to what &s;he &s;till believed &s;ir William mu&s;t think right, and would therefore in time pur&s;ue, to the contrary habits in which he had been &s;o long en|gaged, to the different &s;olicitudes that at pre&s;ent occupied him, and to the novelty of a country life, and country cares. To her he was lavi&s;h: and therefore &s;he could di&s;tribute her guineas around her to the relief of immediate and impor|tunate di&s;tre&s;s: and with this &s;he endeavoured to re&s;t &s;atisfied, until time would enable her to mature her plans of more permanent a&s;&s;i&s;tance; a&s;&s;i&s;tance that would equally relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of indi|gence, correct the errors of ignorance, and reclaim the wanderings of vice.</P>
<P>As &s;ir William and Ellen rode or walked out together, &s;he would a&s;k que&s;tions of the women or children that fell in her way, or would &s;top and enter any cottage, which either from its neatne&s;s or de&s;olation particularly drew her attention. But &s;ir William betrayed the greate&s;t impatience on her thus withdrawing her attentions one moment from him. He &s;eemed enraptured to have her
<PB N="175" REF="036127_0173_1008506036644160">
left to him&s;elf, and as if he could not endure that even her duties &s;hould &s;hare her with him.</P>
<P>The perfect indifference, or marked di&s;appro|bation with which he heard her tales of di&s;tre&s;s, and her projects for relieving the &s;ufferers, awak|ened Ellen to a mo&s;t painful conviction, that &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ider her&s;elf as &s;ufficiently happy, if &s;he were allowed in &s;ilence and unob&s;erved, as it were, to pur&s;ue them: but that &s;he mu&s;t not hope from &s;ir William either concurrence or applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Ellen here fir&s;t ta&s;ted of tho&s;e waters of di&s;ap|pointment, which were afterwards to flow with &s;o full a &s;tream.</P>
<P>The affection &s;he entertained for &s;ir William was compo&s;ed of confidence and benevolence; of a &s;en&s;e of the virtues &s;he believed he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and of the gratification that his manners and conver|&s;ation afforded to her ta&s;te. On this affection &s;he had boldly promi&s;ed her&s;elf happine&s;s in her connexion with him, notwith&s;tanding the de|cided preference &s;he had formerly entertained for Henry. She looked around her; and &s;aw a very &s;ufficient degree of happine&s;s attached to the &s;tate of marriage, where the contracting parties were well known not to have united them&s;elves with the objects of their fir&s;t affections: and &s;he reli|giou&s;ly believed, that felicity depended much more upon the qualities of the hu&s;band, than upon the accidental circum&s;tance of his having been the fir&s;t per&s;on who&s;e merit had made any impre&s;&s;ion upon the heart of the wife. "Sir William is worthy, is plea&s;ing," &s;aid Ellen; "and I &s;hall be happy."</P>
<P>Nothing could have been more ju&s;t than her conclu&s;ion, had her premi&s;es been firm. But if the virtues were to di&s;appear on which her confi|dence
<PB N="176" REF="036127_0174_10085061C12EE6F8">
and her benevolence re&s;ted, how inade|quate to her happine&s;s would be that affection, which had nothing left for its &s;upport but the external graces of manner and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;oon found the whole &s;cheme of her hap|pine&s;s mu&s;t be incomplete. But &s;he &s;till flattered her&s;elf (for &s;he was young, and had all that &s;an|guinene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition that accompanies the warme&s;t philanthropy) &s;he &s;till flattered her&s;elf, that &s;ome parts were yet in her power.</P>
<P>She had promi&s;ed her&s;elf, indeed, that &s;ir Wil|liam would go hand in hand with her in her vir|tues, as well as her plea&s;ures. But if &s;he could not accompli&s;h the fir&s;t, &s;he yet did not de&s;pair of the &s;econd; and was not without hope, that by this circuitous road, &s;he might at length lead him to the point &s;he wi&s;hed. She therefore eagerly concurred with him in a de&s;ign he had formed, of building her a dairy hou&s;e. But the o&s;tentation he di&s;played in his manner of doing it, and the parade he made of &s;tudying her ta&s;te, while he &s;hewed the mo&s;t unequivocal di&s;&s;atisfaction if that ta&s;te differed in the &s;malle&s;t degree from his own, effectually &s;ickened poor Ellen of the dairy-hou&s;e long before it was fini&s;hed; and &s;he never drank one bowl of cream within its walls, uncon|taminated by the effects of &s;ir William's &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, violence, or jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Every day brought the di&s;appointed Ellen, fre&s;h proofs of all tho&s;e failings in the mind of him whom &s;he had engaged to love and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>His expen&s;es flowed but in the &s;ingle channel of &s;elf-gratification. They reached <HI>her</HI> indeed; becau&s;e to ornament and indulge her made at pre&s;ent a principal part of his gratification: but to have plea&s;ures, however innocent or prai&s;e-worthy,
<PB N="177" REF="036127_0175_100850634D3C7938">
which &s;he did not refer to him, &s;he &s;oon di&s;covered would be con&s;idered as a crime.</P>
<P>From the &s;ofte&s;t manners and mo&s;t courtly ad|dre&s;s, &s;he frequently &s;aw him, on the &s;lighte&s;t provocation from a &s;ervant, become furious and abu&s;ive: and &s;he could not conceal from her&s;elf, that in his dealings with his dependants, he was oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical.</P>
<P>Ellen was the admiration and the love of the neighbourhood. Her youth and gaiety of di&s;po|&s;ition led her to participate in all the plea&s;ures which were offered her, and to promote them by every means in her power. Sir William &s;oon taught her, for no one could be more quick in taking a hint, that &s;uch gaiety and &s;uch good neighbourhood were di&s;plea&s;ing to him: and Ellen quickly withdrew from her u&s;ual parties.</P>
<P>To have made &s;uch a &s;acrifice to any rea&s;on|able feeling in the brea&s;t of &s;ir William, would have co&s;t Ellen nothing. It was the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that &s;he made it to the hydra-headed mon&s;ter, jealou&s;y, that gave it any &s;ting.</P>
<P>Of whom, it will be a&s;ked, was &s;ir William jealous? Of every body, of every thing that con|tributed to the plea&s;ures of Ellen, independent of his agency.</P>
<P>To all the unfavourable &s;u&s;picions relative to &s;ir William's heart, and temper, which had, in a vague and doubtful form, ari&s;en in her mind be|fore her marriage, the occurrences of every day now gave &s;hape and &s;tability: and Ellen had not been married &s;ix months, before &s;he found her&s;elf involved in the difficult ta&s;k of keeping alive, by every artifice in her power, her affection for a man, who might, had he plea&s;ed, in half that time
<PB N="178" REF="036127_0176_10085065D0AEA528">
have &s;ecured her heart immovably his own for ever. But the efforts of &s;ir William &s;eemed di|rected, if indeed they had any direction, rather to de&s;troy than to excite or nouri&s;h love.</P>
<P>On the &s;ucce&s;sful cultivation of her affection for her hu&s;band, Ellen knew that all her happine&s;s, and &s;he feared much of the performance of her duty, depended. She had, it is true, been only acquainted with di&s;appointment: and &s;he had proved her&s;elf equal to the &s;evere&s;t &s;elf-denial. But her &s;orrows had then found the &s;ofte&s;t &s;oother, and her virtuous re&s;ignation the warme&s;t pa|negyric, in the kindne&s;s and partiality of her fa|ther. In the bittere&s;t moments of her di&s;tre&s;s, in the mo&s;t laborious of her &s;truggles, his &s;ympathy and his approbation had &s;tilled the voice of com|plaint, and &s;moothed the rugged road of virtue. In the trials which &s;he now fore&s;aw awaited her, &s;he could hope for no &s;uch &s;upport, for no &s;uch encouragement. Her fir&s;t duty was concealment. The mo&s;t wilful blindne&s;s with re&s;pect to her&s;elf, and the mo&s;t inviolable &s;ilence with re&s;pect to others, was the fir&s;t, the indi&s;pen&s;able rule by which &s;he was henceforth to form her conduct.</P>
<P>But, feeling, how could &s;he per&s;uade her&s;elf &s;he did not feel? And, &s;uffering, how could &s;he be &s;ilent? Di&s;appointed, how could &s;he put on the air of &s;atisfaction? and lo&s;ing all on which &s;he could ground e&s;teem, how could &s;he pre&s;erve love? The&s;e were points of con&s;tant and painful doubt and deliberation. But more immediate evil pre&s;&s;ed upon her.</P>
<P>"Where &s;he could not love, &s;he could derive no &s;atisfaction from being beloved. She felt that it was not the virtues of her heart, nor even the powers of her under&s;tanding, that made her &s;o
<PB N="179" REF="036127_0177_1008506758731820">
much the object of pa&s;&s;ion to &s;ir William. She was thoroughly awakened to the conviction, that the &s;olicitude which, in the early days of their acquaintance, he had di&s;covered as to her real character, and upon which &s;he had afterwards reflected with &s;o much &s;atisfaction, as a proof that his affection for her was founded upon tho&s;e qualities, of which he would be the more a&s;&s;ured, the more he knew her, was in fact nothing more than a &s;elfi&s;h anxiety, le&s;t, in the apparently gentle and complacent virgin, he &s;hould hereafter di&s;|cover the arrogant and &s;elf-willed wife. In a regulated temper, he &s;aw a &s;ecurity for his do|me&s;tic peace. In &s;oundne&s;s of principles he be|held the guarantee of his honour. And in his &s;y&s;tematic &s;earch for a wife, by whom to give an heir to his e&s;tate, he had, in re&s;pect to character, looked no farther.</P>
<P>In fixing upon Ellen, he had been determined, by finding rea&s;on to believe, that in &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and in goodne&s;s of heart, &s;he yielded the palm to no one. He had warily decided to fix upon a wife before he was in love: and Ellen's per&s;on, which had at fir&s;t appeared to him, rather &s;imply plea&s;ing than beautiful, &s;eemed calculated to gratify his eye, without intoxicating his &s;en&s;es. But although Ellen did not &s;eize the &s;oul with the fir&s;t glance, her's was even a more dangerous fa&s;|cination. The charms of her conver&s;ation, the graces of her manner, the winning &s;incerity and mode&s;t frankne&s;s of her character, all con&s;pired to render her irre&s;i&s;tible, and to give her that power over the mind which beauty alone never be&s;towed. Sir William had become madly in love: and no &s;entiment in the brea&s;t of Ellen, not wholly corre&s;pondent to that which he felt for
<PB N="180" REF="036127_0178_1008506CECD45950">
her, could &s;atisfy his de&s;ires, or lull his jealou&s;ies to &s;leep.</P>
<P>In the well governed mind of Ellen this was a pa&s;&s;ion that could find no admittance. No merit whatever could have excited it. How impo&s;&s;ible, then, was it, that &s;he &s;hould feel &s;uch love for a man, who every day lo&s;t ground in her e&s;teem, not only by his conduct towards others, but even towards her&s;elf!</P>
<P>Sir William, in having become a lover, had re|tained his dread of being made a dupe to the pa&s;|&s;ion of love. Hence, even his fondne&s;s was cap|tious, and his indulgence tyrannical; and Ellen, who in marriage had &s;ought a friend, found by turns only a lover or a ma&s;ter.</P>

<BIBL>GOLDSMITH.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was in making the&s;e mortifying di&s;coveries that Ellen &s;pent the fir&s;t &s;ix months after her marriage.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in her &s;chemes of benevolence, mi&s;taken in the character of her hu&s;band, di&s;&s;a|tisfied with her&s;elf, &s;he was &s;ometimes tempted to arraign her own conduct in having married &s;ir William. But this was an idea that her good &s;en&s;e ea&s;ily corrected.</P>
<P>Keeping fa&s;t to principles, &s;he knew her&s;elf unaccountable for events. If &s;he had been mi&s;|taken, it was from no want of due con&s;ideration, from no precipitancy of action, produced by im|proper motives. She reviewed her conduct; and found, that being placed again in the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;ame lights, &s;he &s;hould again act the &s;ame part. This conviction &s;omewhat calmed her mind. What appeared &s;o rea&s;onable, &s;he was per&s;uaded mu&s;t have a &s;uffi|cient portion of good in it, to &s;atisfy a rational creature. She endeavoured to find out this good.</P>
<P>She con&s;idered that her's was no uncommon ca&s;e; that marriage-di&s;content was a weed that found nouri&s;hment in every &s;oil; that it &s;prang up alike in the fields of love, and in the wilds of am|bition and avarice; that no fore&s;ight could &s;tifle,
<PB N="182" REF="036127_0180_100850735320A6F8">
no prudence eradicate it. If her own marriage furni&s;hed an example that the coole&s;t inve&s;tigation was not &s;ufficient to guard from the mo&s;t fatal mi&s;takes in a matrimonial choice, her father's equally condemned the yielding to the blind im|pul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"There are evils," &s;aid &s;he, "which no human fore&s;ight can teach us to avert, which no purity of intention, can enable us to e&s;cape. In the con|duct under &s;uch evils lies our trial, and the foun|dation of our future reward or puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>This thought brought with it a train of the mo&s;t anxious &s;olicitudes. Ellen had all the mi&s;|tru&s;t of her&s;elf, which true humility and an earne&s;t de&s;ire to do right, ever induces. To guard her|&s;elf from that acute &s;en&s;e of her &s;orrow which might lead to faulty regrets, or culpable impa|tience, &s;he carefully avoided every exaggeration of her di&s;appointment which fancy could have &s;ugge&s;ted. She would not allow her&s;elf to think her's a peculiar misfortune, or attended with any particularly aggravating circum&s;tances. She re|pul&s;ed from her mind all anticipations, and all re|tro&s;pects. She made every hour bear its own burden, and, as much as in her power, was ready to accept the pre&s;ent good, without perver&s;ely dwelling upon the pa&s;t, or anxiou&s;ly conjecturing the future.</P>
<P>If &s;ir William's ill humour, or his fondne&s;s, (for effects were often the &s;ame, when cau&s;es were different) put her out of her way of virtue or of, plea&s;ure, &s;he &s;ought &s;ome other path which might lead, though not &s;o directly, to her point. His ill humour &s;he endeavoured to di&s;arm by com|plai&s;ance, and by gaiety, and to meet his fondne&s;s with the genuine &s;atisfaction of reciprocal love.
<PB N="183" REF="036127_0181_10085074DB5694B8">
But this was the mo&s;t difficult part of her ta&s;k. Could &s;he have e&s;teemed him, his har&s;hne&s;s and his unrea&s;onablene&s;s with re&s;pect to her&s;elf, &s;he could have more ea&s;ily borne, and would hope to have &s;ubdued. But in lo&s;ing her e&s;teem for him, &s;he lo&s;t this hope: and, in lo&s;ing this hope, &s;he lo&s;t the power of returning his pa&s;&s;ion with any but di&s;&s;embled kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus Ellen, with the mo&s;t &s;incere and upright of human hearts, &s;aw her&s;elf obliged to cultivate hypocri&s;y as a virtue. But that which is a crime in others, was in her only a misfortune.</P>
<P>From a never-cea&s;ing &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;appoint|ments, and from the accumulated weight of dif|ficult duties, Ellen was &s;omewhat relieved by her removal to town. The novelty of the &s;cene, the gaiety of the amu&s;ements, the objects of &s;plendor and curio&s;ity with which &s;he was &s;urrounded, filled and amu&s;ed her mind. Sir William, too, &s;eemed to have left much of his ill humour and narrowne&s;s of heart in the country. The air of London appeared to be more congenial to his character, and to call forth all the amiable parts of it. His liberality and gaiety revived; his money flowed freely round him; his hou&s;e was open to the be&s;t &s;ociety; his entertainments were elegant; and his e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;plendid.</P>
<P>But the principle of all this was little &s;uited to that on which Ellen acted, and on which &s;he wi&s;hed him to have acted. "This, this," would he &s;ay to her, "is life! I grudge every guinea I expend in the country. I hate that my money &s;hould be &s;wallowed in thick ale down the throats of &s;tupid country oafs, or be wa&s;ted in courting a popularity, which is both the ruin and di&s;grace of whoever enjoys it."</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="036127_0182_100850778798F240">"But in the improvement of the beauties of nature," &s;aid Ellen, "or in the relief of the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, or age, money will not be mi&s;|applied even in the country."</P>
<P>"What beauties of nature are comparable to tho&s;e di&s;played in Hyde Park, or Ken&s;ington Gardens? And what di&s;tre&s;&s;es are tho&s;e that the poor laws do not amply provide for? There is no other country in Europe, where there is &s;uch a provi&s;ion made for the poor, by the laws, as in England: no country that can vie with it in public in&s;titutions for the relief of all kinds of mi&s;ery. I approve all this: but having contri|buted my part to the&s;e in&s;titutions, I have done enough; I have done what I can afford: and pri|vate charities, I am convinced, are only the nouri&s;hers of idlene&s;s and the dupes of impo&s;ition."</P>
<P>Ellen did not pre&s;s upon the &s;ubject: but &s;he could not but ob&s;erve to her&s;elf, that the man who did not think two hundred pounds too much to expend in one evening's amu&s;ement in London, could not, with much appearance of truth, &s;ay, he had done all he could afford towards relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>It was one of &s;ir William's favourite maxims, that money &s;pent in luxury was of more u&s;e, than if given in charity: and he would point out to Ellen, with a triumphant air, the &s;plendor and richne&s;s of the &s;hops, and a&s;k her, if &s;he did not think that tho&s;e who contributed to the &s;upport of them, were of infinitely more u&s;e to &s;ociety, than all the good hou&s;ewives and lady Bountifuls that ever were born.</P>
<P>Ellen was too wi&s;e to argue with &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and prejudice. "Could the whole world be a Lon|don, my dear &s;ir William," &s;he would &s;ay, "your
<PB N="185" REF="036127_0183_1008507910F57DE0">
argument might be conclu&s;ive. But after doing all we can to the &s;upport of the&s;e manufacturers of the luxuries of life, there will &s;till remain a large country world, who will peri&s;h for the want of the nece&s;&s;aries of it, if tho&s;e of &s;uperior fortunes do not &s;ometimes turn their thoughts from the &s;hop to the cottage."</P>
<P>The&s;e kind of conver&s;ations made their rambles through London but little plea&s;ing to Ellen: but &s;he &s;eemed to follow &s;ir William's lead; took more than u&s;ual care of the elegance of her appearance; cultivated her inclination for amu&s;ement; and &s;ought, by every means in her power, to do ho|nour to &s;ir William's ta&s;te, and to &s;upport her part in the &s;ociety he had introduced her to.</P>
<P>In the perpetual crowd in which &s;he lived, there &s;eemed to be little probability &s;he &s;hould make any &s;elections that could alarm his jealou&s;y, or wound his &s;elf-love. She had not time to know any one well enough to become attached to him. Her time and her thoughts were taken up by a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of engagements: but &s;he had too good health and &s;pirits to be ea&s;ily tired: and a per&s;on of Ellen's quickne&s;s of parts and cultivated under&s;tanding, found, even in the promi&s;cuous crowd of triflers and &s;impletons, many per&s;ons from whom &s;he reaped both advan|tage and amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>If Ellen's heart was heavy in &s;cenes, where from her youth, her attractions, and the advantages with which &s;he appeared, &s;he ought to have felt only &s;elf-gratulation and plea&s;ure; it was not from any retro&s;pect in which &s;he indulged her&s;elf, but from the immediate weight which the conviction of the real character of the man on whom &s;he was
<PB N="186" REF="036127_0184_1008507A97F70668">
to depend for happine&s;s, and with whom &s;he was to pa&s;s her life, had fixed there. To love tho&s;e with whom &s;he was intimately connected, was indi&s;pen&s;ible to the felicity of Ellen. This the character of &s;ir William made impo&s;&s;ible: and hence Ellen, with every other ble&s;&s;ing which hu|man beings implore, was wretched.</P>
<P>But Ellen was not wretched alone. Neither the hopele&s;s &s;tate to which he was reduced, nor the fortitude he had exerted, had been able to re&s;tore to Henry his peace of mind. The mar|riage of lady Almeria had been a momentary re|lief to him: but like the remi&s;&s;ion of a fever, the di&s;order &s;eemed to have gained &s;trength by its temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. Had Ellen been unmar|ried, and the ob&s;tacle of lady Almeria removed, (the thought pierced him with ten thou&s;and &s;tings) another lady Almeria would have been found, replied his rea&s;on: Lady Almeria was not &s;o re|&s;olutely cho&s;en as Ellen rejected.</P>
<P>"Be it as it may," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "the die is ca&s;t; my fate is determined. I will follow the track I have chalked out for my&s;elf."</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this re&s;olution he had vi&s;ited his family. He had been kindly received. He had endeavoured to rejoice in the kindne&s;s, and to bu&s;y him&s;elf in the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e around him. But the character of Henry was gone. His gaiety, his impetuo&s;ity, his &s;ocial humour, his openne&s;s of heart were no more. An invincible gravity had taken their place, and a cold re&s;erve to all, with a chilling indifference to every thing around him, marked all his actions. He rather appeared, however, to have lo&s;t the reli&s;h for plea&s;ure, than to &s;hun it. He affected nothing: but from the
<PB N="187" REF="036127_0185_10085082A21B1058">
genuine overflowing &s;orrows of his heart, he was incapable of taking intere&s;t in any thing. There were times, when he felt a&s;hamed of being thus overcome with his feelings: and then he made &s;ome more vigorous efforts to recover the natural tone of his mind. He imagined he &s;hould be more likely to do &s;o, were he again to &s;ee, and accu&s;tom him&s;elf to the pre&s;ence of Ellen.</P>
<P>"Henceforward," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "&s;he is to be nothing to me but the highly cheri&s;hed re|membrance of an invaluable ble&s;&s;ing lo&s;t for ever. Let me familiarize my&s;elf to that dear picture. It may be a means of rendering the &s;en&s;e of my lo&s;s le&s;s bitter."</P>
<P>Under the influence of the&s;e thoughts he came to town. It was ea&s;y for him to &s;ee Ellen every day without being ob&s;erved by her: and when he had &s;ubdued the at fir&s;t ungovernable tumults which the &s;ight of her for the &s;everal fir&s;t times had occa&s;ioned, he re&s;olved to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before her. He remembered the la&s;t words he had ever heard her utter, "I am going no where, but where if you plea&s;e you may accompany me." I may &s;ee her &s;till, thought he. As a friend I may &s;ee her. And the friend&s;hip of Ellen is worth the love of all her &s;ex be&s;ide.</P>
<P>One evening as Ellen was coming out of her box at the opera, accompanied by lady Almeria Henry appeared at the door.</P>
<P>"See, &s;ir Doleful Di&s;mal!" &s;aid lady Almeria. "Do you know you have quite &s;poilt that man?"</P>
<P>Ellen involuntarily &s;topped. She could not for an in&s;tant move on. But Henry, who had been learning his le&s;&s;on, approached her. He had ra|ther the air of a per&s;on who was accu&s;tomed to &s;ee her every evening, than of a lover, who now,
<PB N="188" REF="036127_0186_100850842BBE3A18">
for the fir&s;t time after their &s;eparation, beheld the beloved object which fate had torn from his arms, without being able to di&s;lodge her from his heart.</P>
<P>He enquired after her health. He a&s;ked how &s;he liked the opera. He de&s;ired to know if he could be of any u&s;e. And all this before Ellen, a&s;toni&s;hed and pained by the profound gravity and coldne&s;s of his manner, had &s;ufficient pre&s;ence of mind to utter a word.</P>
<P>"How you two look!" &s;aid lady Almeria laughing. "Dear, &s;he's very well. She has been enchanted with the opera: and if you will &s;ee for her carriage, you'll do us a favour."</P>
<P>Henry di&s;appeared like an arrow out of a bow. In &s;pite of all his preparation, the &s;cene was too much for him; nor could he have borne it a mo|ment longer.</P>
<P>"How very ill mr. Villars looks!" &s;aid Ellen, endeavouring to recover her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"And how very ill lady Ackland looks!" re|turned the unmerciful lady Almeria. "Here, child, take my &s;alts. If tho&s;e impertinents were to come by ju&s;t now, who were di&s;puting the other night whether you wore rouge, the wager would be decided in a minute."</P>
<P>"How you rattle! I want no &s;alts."</P>
<P>"No to be &s;ure. Well don't be afraid! I won't tell the old gentleman at home."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t beg, lady Almeria," &s;aid Ellen, ear|ne&s;tly, "that you will not &s;peak &s;o. You know I will not &s;uffer it."</P>
<P>"Well, then, I will tell him. Will that plea&s;e you? There's no knowing how to deal with you &s;entimental people."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then &s;ome gentlemen of their acquaintance
<PB N="189" REF="036127_0187_10085085B2ED52B0">
inquired whether they would call their &s;ervants. Ellen thankfully accepted the offer: but lady Al|meria &s;aid, 'How can you be &s;o rude? don't you know poor &s;ir Doleful is gone on the &s;ame er|rand? he'll be in de&s;pair, if you run away with out &s;eeing him!'</P>
<P>Henry at that moment returned; and &s;aying the coach was then at the door, took Ellen's hand to lead her to it. It was with &s;ome difficulty he got her through the crowd: and the embarra&s;&s;|ments they were in from that circum&s;tance, re|lieved them both from the greater embarra&s;&s;ments of their own minds.</P>
<P>As he put her into the coach, "May I vi&s;it you?" &s;aid he, "and will you introduce me to &s;ir William?"</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly, with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure," &s;aid &s;he. It was all &s;he could &s;ay; for lady Al|meria followed her: and the coach drove off.</P>

<P>LADY ALMERIA accompanied Ellen home, nor did &s;he &s;pare her raillery. They were en|gaged to meet a party at &s;upper; but as it was &s;omewhat early, nobody happened to be arrived: and they therefore found &s;ir William, who was ju&s;t returned from his dinner &s;ociety, alone.</P>
<P>Ellen would have cho&s;en not to have men|tioned Henry's name before lady Almeria: but as &s;he was confident it would come out in the cour&s;e of the evening, that &s;he had met with him, &s;he thought it mo&s;t prudent to &s;peak, with all the indifference &s;he could a&s;&s;ume, of the circum&s;tance her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I have &s;een mr. Villars," &s;aid &s;he to &s;ir Wil|liam: "and he has de&s;ired me to introduce him to you."</P>
<P>"Oh! I wi&s;h you had &s;een them both," cried lady Almeria, "one &s;o grave, the other &s;o pale. Bow goes his wor&s;hip; court&s;ey goes her lady&s;hip. You would have &s;worn they had not &s;een each other for three hundred years, and were not over|joyed at the meeting now. Well, I prote&s;t I don't wonder Ellen cho&s;e you, if &s;he could have any notion what kind of man Henry would be|come; for I prote&s;t I think you ten times the more agreeable per&s;on, I vow."</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="036127_0189_1008508B8F2AF328">"Did you &s;ay you would introduce mr. Villars to me?" a&s;ked &s;ir William very gravely, without regarding lady Almeria.</P>
<P>"I did," &s;aid Ellen.</P>
<P>"Why, can you have any objection!" &s;aid lady Almeria. "Ellen you know jilted him for you."</P>
<P>"What non&s;en&s;e you talk, lady Almeria!" &s;aid Ellen.</P>
<P>"She certainly does not talk truth," &s;aid &s;ir William, with the &s;ame gravity as before. And here, much to the relief of Ellen, they were joined by more company: and the evening pa&s;&s;ed as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>When they retired to their own apartments, Ellen remarked a gloom upon &s;ir William's coun|tenance, which &s;he had never before ob&s;erved &s;ince their arrival in London. She endeavoured to di&s;&s;ipate it by more than u&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s on her part: but he &s;eemed to regard her with an eye of &s;u&s;picion, and pre&s;erved a gloomy &s;ilence. Ellen he&s;itated whether &s;he &s;hould &s;eem to remark this change in his humour, and endeavour to regain his confidence, and di&s;&s;ipate his chagrin, by ex|plicit declarations of unalterable attachment.</P>
<P>But the ca&s;e between them was much changed, from what it had been at the period when &s;he had la&s;t &s;een Henry, and when &s;he had held this con|duct with advantage. Sir William at that mo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her e&s;teem and warme&s;t friend&s;hip. Now he had nearly lo&s;t both one and the other. With truth could &s;he have promi&s;ed inviolable con&s;tancy: but to &s;peak of an un&s;haken attach|ment which no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, &s;eemed adding hypocri&s;y to unkindne&s;s. The profe&s;&s;ions &s;he had formerly made him, had flowed freely from her
<PB N="192" REF="036127_0190_1008508F5F66ECD8">
heart: now they would be uttered with embar|ra&s;&s;ment and coldne&s;s. The fears which then &s;eemed to oppre&s;s him, &s;he had regarded with compa&s;&s;ion. The &s;u&s;picions that he now evi|dently entertained, &s;he con&s;idered as injurious. They appeared but new marks of that narrow and &s;elfi&s;h mind, the effects of which &s;he had every day rea&s;on to deplore.</P>
<P>The debate whether &s;he &s;hould conquer &s;uch feelings, or yield to them, held her &s;o long, that before &s;he was aware, her &s;ilence was as marked as &s;ir William's: and they both retired to re&s;t, with equal di&s;inclination to &s;leep.</P>
<P>Some few hours of unea&s;y thought re&s;tored to Ellen her u&s;ual calm of mind.</P>
<P>However oppre&s;&s;ed her heart might feel, by the afflictive change that appeared to be wrought in the character of Henry&mdash;and however alarmed, and &s;omewhat offended &s;he might be by the &s;u&s;picions to which &s;he was aware &s;ir William had yielded&mdash;yet her confidence, that her conduct would never ju&s;tify the one, and her hope that time might bring &s;ome alleviation to the other, enabled her wholly to &s;uppre&s;s her re&s;entment, and &s;o far to overcome her &s;orrow, as to bani&s;h from her countenance and manner every appear|ance of it. In the cour&s;e of her reflections &s;he had al&s;o made &s;ome which had &s;oftened her heart toward &s;ir William.</P>
<P>Oh! thought &s;he, that he would but let me love him! The heart that can form &s;uch a wi&s;h, is not far from its gratification: and it was with un|affected tenderne&s;s, that Ellen propo&s;ed to &s;ir William to pa&s;s the morning in an excur&s;ion &s;ome miles out of town, which he had talked of a few days before. But &s;ir William coldly re|pul&s;ed
<PB N="193" REF="036127_0191_10085090E6B35170">
her by an air of &s;cornful indifference, and by &s;aying he had engagements el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>El&s;ewhere he went: for he quitted Ellen the moment breakfa&s;t was over: and &s;he &s;aw him no more in the cour&s;e of the morning.</P>
<P>Ellen had previou&s;ly dedicated this morning to &s;ome home occupations: but the tumult of mind &s;ir William's unkind behaviour occa&s;ioned, with the train of dangerous reflections it drew after it, made her afraid to tru&s;t her&s;elf with her|&s;elf for a whole morning. The moment, there|fore, that &s;he could compo&s;e her&s;elf, after his departure, &s;he ordered her carriage, and conti|nued to find occupation from home 'till a late hour.</P>
<P>On her return, the fir&s;t card &s;he &s;aw was that of mr. Villars: but &s;he had little time to think of this circum&s;tance, when &s;he found to her &s;ur|pri&s;e, that &s;ir William was not returned home.</P>
<P>They were engaged to dine at her brother's: but Ellen having waited in vain beyond all dinner time, for the return of &s;ir William, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;o inexpre&s;&s;ibly unea&s;y, that &s;he was in no condition to keep her engagement. She therefore excu&s;ed her&s;elf on the &s;core of indi&s;po&s;ition: and with a heart oppre&s;&s;ed by fears and apprehen&s;ions, to which &s;he &s;carcely dared to give a name, &s;he awaited with a degree of excruciating impatience, which &s;he had never before felt, the return of &s;ir William.</P>
<P>The clock had &s;truck nine when &s;he heard his knock at the door. She ran to the top of the &s;tairs to meet him, and catching hold of his hand, "How glad I am to &s;ee you! where, where have you been?"</P>
<P>"I have been at your brother's," &s;aid he
<PB N="194" REF="036127_0192_10085093E1A0FA70">
coldly. "But I could not &s;tay when I heard you were ill. Are you better?"</P>
<P>"But where were you all this morning? Why did you not come home to dre&s;s?"</P>
<P>"I was kept late in the city. I knew your brother would excu&s;e me. But what's the matter? What kept you away?"</P>
<P>While Ellen detailed her fears, and her unea|&s;ine&s;s, &s;ir William regarded her with an air as if he doubted the truth of what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>"I thought," returned he, "you had been above the fooli&s;h fears of your &s;ex. It is a pity you gave way to them in this in&s;tance. You have mi&s;&s;ed &s;eeing an old friend. Mr. Villars was at your brother's."</P>
<P>The in&s;ulting unkindne&s;s of the&s;e words filled Ellen's eyes with tears.</P>
<P>"No, &s;ir William," &s;aid &s;he, "I have mi&s;&s;ed nothing that I regret on that account, I a&s;&s;ure you. I &s;ee how your &s;u&s;picions wrong me. But, receive my &s;olemn promi&s;e, that as far as it depends upon me, I have &s;een mr. Villars for the la&s;t time."</P>
<P>"No romantic re&s;olutions, I beg. Let me not be made ridiculous by your high-flown virtue. If mr. Villars be as indifferent to you as he ought to be, and as you have pretended, why &s;hould he not vi&s;it at my hou&s;e like any other per&s;on of your or my acquaintance?"</P>
<P>"I might have a&s;ked you that que&s;tion; for the objection &s;eemed to come from you."</P>
<P>"And you did not know mr. Villars was to be at your brother's to-day? And you did not &s;tay away on that account?"</P>
<P>"No, upon my honour. I &s;tayed away for the rea&s;ons I have given you."</P>
<P>"Then I a&s;k your pardon. I have been too
<PB N="195" REF="036127_0193_10085097DE321658">
ha&s;ty in my conclu&s;ions perhaps. Mr. Villars is now my acquaintance. You will con&s;ider him henceforward as &s;uch. And if you would have me believe that you regard him in no other light, you will make him as much and neither more nor le&s;s of your parties than you do any other per&s;on, who has the &s;ame claim to your attentions."</P>
<P>This was almo&s;t too much for Ellen. But &s;ub|duing every re&s;entment, and every tender feeling, &s;he &s;aid, "I will do in this, and all other things, as nearly what you wi&s;h as I can; and where I fail, I hope your candour and your love will be heard in my excu&s;e."</P>
<P>"Oh! Ellen," &s;aid &s;ir William, gra&s;ping her hand, "could you but love me as I have loved you!&mdash;But I am a fool to expect it. I make my|&s;elf ridiculous. I'll change my dre&s;s and we'll go together to mr. Curzon's; and then let this non|&s;en&s;e be forgotten."</P>
<P>"Oh!" cried Ellen to her&s;elf, with a deep &s;igh, as he left the room, "how impo&s;&s;ible it is to love this man!"</P>
<P>At mr. Curzon's they met lady Almeria.</P>
<P>"So, &s;o, you are not &s;ick after all," &s;aid &s;he. "I never thought you were. I'll lay my life you were afraid of meeting your old lover."</P>
<P>Ellen would have explained how the unac|countable ab&s;ence of &s;ir William had alarmed her.</P>
<P>"Yes, yes, very likely. I don't believe a word of it though. But come, if you are not really afraid, &s;hew it now, for there he is. In &s;pite of his grave face, I would bring him with me. Thank my &s;tars, Mordaunt is not jealous."</P>
<P>Although all this was not profe&s;&s;edly &s;aid in the hearing of &s;ir William, yet was he &s;o near that he lo&s;t not a word of it. He now walked on: and
<PB N="196" REF="036127_0194_1008509966CAFC08">
lady Almeria &s;aid, "I was running away; for the place is as dull as a quaker's meeting. I can|not get a party at ca&s;&s;ino, but with old dowagers, the very &s;ight of whom gives me the vapours. But now you are come I &s;hall have a little chat: or, come, let us &s;it down to ca&s;&s;ino, and mr. Vil|lars &s;hall be of our party; though he is almo&s;t as bad as an old dowager too. But perhaps your pre&s;ence will enliven him."</P>
<P>Mr. Villars then came up; and with great gra|vity, hoped Ellen was better.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, &s;he was never ill!" &s;aid the ever talking lady Almeria. "I told you &s;o all along."</P>
<P>"I hope mr. Villars will, in this ca&s;e, rather believe me than you," &s;aid Ellen with a &s;mile. "But I am now quite well."</P>
<P>"This was the fir&s;t time that Ellen had ever called Henry mr. Villars, when &s;peaking to him. The word ran through his veins like ice.</P>
<P>"Lady Almeria is &s;o good as to an&s;wer for every body," &s;aid he, faintly &s;miling. "It is no wonder that with &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s upon her hands, &s;he is not always quite accurate."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee you improve," returned &s;he. "I have not heard you attempt being &s;aucy this age. But you mu&s;t play at ca&s;&s;ino with us. I have been doing nothing 'till I am tired to death."</P>
<P>"Let &s;ir William make a fourth," &s;aid Ellen.</P>
<P>"No, indeed," returned lady Almeria &s;harply. "I have had a do&s;e of &s;ir William to-day, I can tell you. He really grows intolerable."</P>
<P>"I hope you intend I &s;hould love you better for &s;uch freedoms," &s;aid Ellen.</P>
<P>"You'll not love me the wor&s;e. Be&s;ides, <HI>I may</HI> &s;peak what I think, whatever <HI>you may</HI> do."</P>
<P>"I have not quite lo&s;t that privilege," returned
<PB N="197" REF="036127_0195_1008509C3210BDF0">
Ellen: "and I tell you plainly that if you mean I &s;hould be of your ca&s;&s;ino party, you mu&s;t be a little more agreeable."</P>
<P>"Agreeable! I'll be as agreeable as an angel. And &s;o do go, that's a good &s;oul, (&s;peaking to Henry) and find us a fourth&mdash;but not &s;ir Wil|liam."</P>
<P>However Henry might take mo&s;t of the&s;e in&s;i|nuations, for lady Almeria's accu&s;tomed rattle, he could not but ob&s;erve the &s;hade of chagrin and melancholy that ru&s;hed on Ellen's brow: and he ob&s;erved it with an anxious curio&s;ity to know the real cau&s;e. He returned in a moment, bringing &s;ir William with him.</P>
<P>"See, I have obeyed you," &s;aid he to lady Al|meria.</P>
<P>"Obeyed me? No: I prote&s;t again&s;t playing with hu&s;bands and wives. Sir William, you are the only man in the room I objected to."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t hope, then," &s;aid he with a laugh, "that you are the only lady in the room that <HI>would</HI> have made the objection. And even that &s;tretch of vanity won't con&s;ole me under the mi&s;|fortune of your di&s;plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"Oh, I did not object to you po&s;itively&mdash;only relatively, in your capacity of hu&s;band."</P>
<P>"There may be &s;omething flattering in that objection," returned he. "And now let you and me try to beat lady Ackland and mr. Villars."</P>
<P>This little party at cards diffu&s;ed &s;omething like ea&s;e among Henry, Ellen, and &s;ir William, in its con&s;equence; though it was little &s;hort of mar|tyrdom at the time: and from this night Henry vi&s;ited and was received at &s;ir William's hou&s;e on the footing of a common acquaintance.</P>

<P>AS Ellen and Henry now &s;aw each other, almo&s;t every day, the emotion with which they at fir&s;t met, wore off by degrees. But Henry lo&s;t no|thing of his gravity: and he could not but perceive that it &s;eemed in &s;ome degree contagious.</P>
<P>Ellen's both natural and a&s;&s;umed &s;pirits too often &s;unk under the weight of every day's vexa|tions which &s;he received from &s;ir William: But Henry, who knew nothing of all this, fluc|tuated between hope and fear, that the pen&s;ive thoughtfulne&s;s which &s;ometimes over&s;pread her countenance, might be imputable to the recol|lection of pa&s;t &s;cenes. He wi&s;hed her happy. He wi&s;hed her upright. But he knew not how to wi&s;h her wholly forgetful of his former &s;uf|ferings, or wholly in&s;en&s;ible to his pre&s;ent. No|thing, however, aro&s;e, that could lead to the clearing his doubts. Ellen did not appear to &s;hun, or to &s;eek his company. She conver&s;ed with him with her u&s;ual frankne&s;s; treated him as her re|lation and friend; but &s;eemed to have, forgotten he had ever been her lover. Yet he often &s;aw
<PB N="199" REF="036127_0197_100850A245788728">
her eyes fill with tears, and a &s;igh o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tisfaction would &s;ometimes e&s;cape her.</P>
<P>He turned his attentions toward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> William; but could &s;ee nothing in his conduct which could give him rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ource of her un|happine&s;s lay there. Sir William was in fact an impenetrable man. He knew how to conceal from the whole world his real di&s;po&s;ition: and he had be&s;ides habitually different manners, and a different countenance, for his public and private hours.</P>
<P>He dreaded to draw on him&s;elf the ridicule which is attached to the character of a jealous hu&s;band: and he wi&s;hed his acquaintance, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of his own &s;tanding in life, to believe him perfectly &s;atisfied in his choice of a wife.</P>
<P>The fangs of jealou&s;y, however, &s;truck deeper and deeper into his heart every day. The more he knew of Henry, the more he knew him to be the man mo&s;t &s;uited to the &s;entiments and feel|ings of Ellen. In accidental conver&s;ations, he was frequently &s;truck by the coincidence of their opi|nions. Their minds &s;eemed to be formed in the &s;ame mould; their hearts to beat in uni&s;on; their wi&s;hes, their plea&s;ures, their pur&s;uits to be the &s;ame. The &s;imilarity of their ta&s;te, and of their virtues, &s;eemed to form them for each other: and he knew not how to tru&s;t, that the latter would be &s;uch a barrier between them, as the former would not &s;urmount. Yet could not the keen eye of jealou&s;y di&s;cover in the conduct of either any thing to reprove.</P>
<P>All was open, frank, and above board. He could not ob&s;erve that Henry &s;ought Ellen apart from him, or from the re&s;t of the world: no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could he di&s;cover in Ellen any affectation of too
<PB N="200" REF="036127_0198_100850A3CE5CA2C0">
much or too little &s;olicitude in her intercour&s;e with Henry. But he &s;u&s;pected that he him&s;elf lo&s;t ground daily in the e&s;teem of Ellen; for he knew that he de&s;erved to do &s;o: and he believed it not in nature that Ellen not loving him, &s;hould forget that &s;he had loved Henry&mdash;Henry, too, &s;o de&s;erving of her love! &s;o con&s;onant to her ta&s;te! &s;o apparently, &s;o almo&s;t avowedly con&s;idering her as the fir&s;t of women! He could not have been more perfectly convinced of their mutual intelli|gence, had he received the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs of it.</P>
<P>Hence his private hours with Ellen were &s;pent in indirect upbraidings, in cruel in&s;inuations, in direct charges of want of love on her part, which &s;uch conduct &s;erved completely to verify.</P>
<P>Ellen oppo&s;ed to all this inju&s;tice the calmne&s;s which good &s;en&s;e dictates, and the gentlene&s;s which a regulated mind in&s;pires. She treated &s;ir William's unkindne&s;s as the effect of a di&s;temper: and &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw no cure for it, but in the mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed frankne&s;s.</P>
<P>"You have conceived the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;u&s;|picions," would &s;he &s;ay to him: "and the misfor|tune is the greater, &s;ince, being totally unfounded, I know not how to clear my&s;elf from them. If you would pre&s;erve any of that love in my brea&s;t, of the diminution of which you &s;o bitterly com|plain, you mu&s;t give it &s;omething whereon to feed. Complaints, reproaches, and calumnies, were never the &s;u&s;tenance of affection. Take me where you will. I am ready to accompany you to the remote&s;t corner of the world: there I will live only with you and for you. Fix upon any plan of life, where, though excluded from the &s;ociety and plea&s;ures of it, you admit of its duties,
<PB N="201" REF="036127_0199_100850A6E710E290">
and you will find me ever ready to concur. But let us not continue amid &s;cenes of imagined amu&s;ement and real mi&s;ery, where it is impo&s;&s;ible but the very conduct you enjoin me, &s;hould fill your heart with bitterne&s;s, and increa&s;e an evil which can only be cured by the reflections which time and a continued ob&s;ervation on my real cha|racter will enable you to make."</P>
<P>This was good advice. But it was the advice of cool rea&s;on, not the fervent expo&s;tulations of ardent love, &s;uffering under the mi&s;ery of &s;u&s;picion. Sir William therefore rather re&s;ented than bene|fited by it.</P>
<P>Retirement, too, was by no means to his ta&s;te. He could not have been happy, even in the love of Ellen, if he mu&s;t only have enjoyed that love in a de&s;ert. The world was the theatre on which his talents and his accompli&s;hments were &s;hewn to mo&s;t advantage. In the &s;ociety of men of genius, in the a&s;&s;emblies of people of high rank, in the circle of courts, &s;ir William had been ac|cu&s;tomed to be li&s;tened to, and admired. And it was in &s;cenes &s;uch as the&s;e that he could alone find happine&s;s. Could Ellen have accompanied him in them, and could he have been convinced that &s;he preferred him to every other man &s;he met there, his happine&s;s would have been com|plete. But in a &s;olitude the gratification of his vanity was wanting to his felicity; and in the world, the gratification of his love. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, however, with the opinion, that Ellen's heart was wholly given up to Henry, he no longer felt any pangs from jealou&s;y, of which he was not the ob|ject: and in removing her from him he removed her from all who&s;e attention towards her, gave
<PB N="202" REF="036127_0200_1008519ABB3804D8">
him unea&s;ine&s;s. Yet to &s;ecure his own honour in the pre&s;ervation of her's, was more a point of delicacy than a cure for the wounds of his mind. Once convinced that &s;he had &s;acrificed it to her pa&s;&s;ion for Henry, and he would have found, if not a compen&s;ation, at lea&s;t a gratification in the &s;ecurity of the puni&s;hment he meditated. But for the pangs inflicted by a per&s;ua&s;ion that he had irrecoverably lo&s;t her affection, no di&s;tance which he could place between her and Henry, no ven|geance which he could pur&s;ue, no indemnification he could propo&s;e to him&s;elf, could heal his &s;or|rows, or re&s;tore him to peace. Solitude he would have thought rather favourable than di&s;ad|vantageous to the &s;entiments he believed &s;he en|tertained: and therefore both to occupy her mind with &s;cenes in which Henry had no &s;hare, as well as to gratify his own ta&s;te, they removed, on leav|ing town, to Weymouth.</P>
<P>Ellen, the unhappy victim of this mixture of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and vanity, had flattered her&s;elf that &s;he &s;hould either have been permitted to vi&s;it Groby Manor, or to return to Oakley. But &s;ir William &s;eemed to have an almo&s;t equal aver&s;ion to both places.</P>
<P>The benevolent expen&s;es of Ellen, at Oakley, which he had no inclination to join in, or de&s;ire to countenance, he felt as a reproach to him: and the &s;cenes of Groby Manor he con&s;idered as too clo&s;ely connected with the memory of Henry, to be favourable to his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Ellen quitted town without regret: but &s;he did not go to Weymouth without reluctance. The little lightne&s;s of heart which &s;he had carried with her to London, had long &s;ince been lo&s;t in the increa&s;ing unkindne&s;s, of &s;ir William. The
<PB N="203" REF="036127_0201_10083878947FCD80">
amu&s;ements it afforded had lo&s;t their novelty, and with their novelty, to a mind &s;o ill at ea&s;e as her's, their power of intere&s;ting. But the duties and plea&s;ures of a country life &s;he knew were &s;o &s;uited to her ta&s;te, as always to afford employment for her faculties and gratification to her heart. She had lo&s;t the hope of being able to love &s;ir William, or of awakening in &s;o irrational and &s;o &s;elfi&s;h a mind as his, that &s;pirit of ju&s;tice, from which, even while he continued to love her, &s;he could alone hope for any degree of happine&s;s; and &s;ometimes extending her views into a futurity when probably he would love her no more, &s;he trembled for the &s;ituation in which &s;he might find her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But Ellen's good &s;en&s;e forbade her to torment her&s;elf with the apprehen&s;ion of any probable evils: and &s;he was more willing to encourage the hope, that if &s;he might be allowed to take up her abode at Oakley, whether &s;ir William cho&s;e to be with her or not, &s;he might always be able to &s;ecure to her&s;elf a very competent &s;hare of content, in the active di&s;charge of her duties. At pre&s;ent &s;he was however compelled to give up all thoughts of the quiet and intere&s;ting occupations of the country; and to prepare her&s;elf for all the fatiguing di&s;&s;ipation, and &s;ickening repetition, of a &s;ea|bathing place.</P>
<P>Ellen had only been a very &s;hort time at Wey|mouth, before &s;he had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf in a &s;ituation which &s;he believed would give the greate&s;t plea&s;ure to &s;ir William.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t months of their marriage, he had expre&s;&s;ed an anxious impatience for the pro&s;|pect of becoming a father, and had more than once te&s;tified chagrin and di&s;appointment, when
<PB N="204" REF="036127_0202_10083880B6734138">
there were no appearances of his &s;oon being one. Ellen her&s;elf anticipated a thou&s;and delightful cares and plea&s;ures which would ari&s;e from the duties of a mother; and was not &s;hy of owning to &s;ir William, that the indi&s;po&s;ition under which &s;he then &s;uffered, would probably put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>But this information, far from being received by &s;ir William with plea&s;ure, &s;eemed to overwhelm him with the &s;en&s;e of &s;ome &s;udden misfortune. His countenance changed: his lips quivered with &s;uppre&s;&s;ed emotion: and he had hardly &s;ufficient command of him&s;elf to utter a word of kindne&s;s or congratulation on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>All this was a perfect enigma to Ellen.&mdash; Happily in this in&s;tance her innocence defeated her penetration: and after much unea&s;y conjecture, &s;he re&s;ted upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, (a &s;uppo&s;ition &s;uf|ficiently painful) that &s;ir William having lo&s;t all love for her, had with it lo&s;t all de&s;ire of any far|ther tie between them. She was confirmed in this idea, when &s;he ob&s;erved, that he rather en|couraged than re&s;trained her in riding, walking, and dancing. But Ellen, who began to &s;ee that all the felicity of her future life might probably depend upon children, became extremely &s;olicitous not to lo&s;e, by any indi&s;cretion of her own, her pre&s;ent promi&s;e of &s;uch a &s;ource of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir William, without &s;eeming to advert to the care &s;he was willing to take of her&s;elf, was always projecting &s;ome party of amu&s;ement; &s;ome riding, fi&s;hing, or frolicking expedition, which called for exertion of bodily &s;trength. Ellen had very good health; and knew not how to hold her&s;elf ex|cu&s;ed from &s;uch engagements, without &s;eeming to take a &s;uper&s;luous and &s;elfi&s;h care of an
<PB N="205" REF="036127_0203_100850A86EC09CD8">
intere&s;t which nobody el&s;e appeared to think about.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent two months at Weymouth, &s;ir William formed a party with another family to travel through South and North Wales, to cro&s;s the kingdom from Che&s;ter to Scarborough, and fully to occupy the time until Chri&s;tmas, when they were engaged to &s;pend a month with mr. Mordaunt and lady Almeria, at their hou&s;e in Devon&s;hire.</P>
<P>Ellen ventured to plead for a little re&s;t, and mentioned Oakley. But &s;ir William told her, that travelling would do her good, and that he had planned the whole &s;cheme entirely on her account.</P>
<P>She was le&s;s di&s;inclined to give into it, from the hopes that when they were &s;o far North as Scar|borough, &s;he &s;hould be able to per&s;uade &s;ir Wil|liam to make a vi&s;it to Groby Manor. She com|municated this hope to her father: and in this hope &s;he performed her peregrination through Wales, with much &s;atisfaction. But by the time they arrived at Scarborough, &s;ir William declared the &s;ea&s;on &s;o far advanced, that no con&s;ideration would induce him to venture a mile farther North: and under this pretence, he hurried her by ha&s;ty journies into Berk&s;hire.</P>
<P>Ellen happily &s;uffered little by all the&s;e jour|neyings. But when &s;he found her&s;elf once again at Oakley, &s;he would have been very happy, if &s;he might have remained there for &s;ome time. Sir William, however, declared him&s;elf impatient to join the &s;ociety at Stanton Park; and to Stanton Park they accordingly went.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria had filled her hou&s;e with a nume|rous party of young di&s;&s;ipated people of fa&s;hion.
<PB N="206" REF="036127_0204_100850AC647129A0">
Hunting, riding, &s;hooting, billiards, and &s;huttle|cock, engaged the mornings. The plea&s;ures of an expen&s;ive table, high play, mu&s;ic and dancing, occupied the evenings. Here appeared love in all its degrees, from the &s;erious, &s;ighing, jealous &s;wain, to the pert fluttering coquet, who laughed at the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he affected to feel.</P>
<P>Mr. Mordaunt and lady Almeria had long cea&s;ed to affect even the &s;emblance of a pa&s;&s;ion which had carried them &s;o precipitately into Scot|land together: but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aving cea&s;ed to contribute to each other's plea&s;ures, they had but fallen into a contrary extreme of wi&s;hing to interrupt them. He was carele&s;s, &s;he indifferent. He coquetted with every pretty woman who would li&s;ten to him: and &s;he flirted with all the agreeable men who came in her way.</P>
<P>She had ju&s;t lain in of a poor neglected little girl, who, confined to the nur&s;ery, was &s;eldom vi&s;ited by her mother. In &s;cenes &s;uch as the&s;e, where Ellen found &s;o much to di&s;approve, and &s;o much to lament, this nur&s;ery &s;eemed her be&s;t refuge: and here &s;he &s;pent many hours every day.</P>
<P>Sir William, &s;ince their abode at Weymouth, &s;eemed to have lo&s;t much of his former pa&s;&s;ion for Ellen: yet he could not &s;ee her, in &s;uch a circle as that with which &s;he was now &s;urrounded, without feeling her &s;uperiority. He did feel it. His love &s;eemed to revive: and he often &s;ought her in this &s;ame nur&s;ery, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed &s;o much of her time.</P>
<P>Ellen, who never lo&s;t &s;ight of the virtuous de&s;ire of being one day able to in&s;pire &s;ir William with &s;uch a way of thinking as would excite and retain her affection, felt her hopes of the approach of &s;o de&s;irable a period &s;pring anew, whenever do|me&s;tic

<Q><L>&mdash;"I am angling now,</L>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ELLEN had now been at Stanton Park more than a month, and the little plea&s;ure &s;he took in the &s;ociety there, or rather, the po&s;itive di&s;appro|bation &s;he felt towards mo&s;t of the individuals who compo&s;ed it, had cau&s;ed her, as it were, to fold up her charms and her talents in a civil re|&s;erve, which forbade all familiarity in tho&s;e who approached her.</P>
<P>At this time mr. Villars arrived at Stanton Park.</P>
<P>There had never been any di&s;tinction between Ellen's manners towards him, and towards tho&s;e, who with him had frequented her hou&s;e in town. There, whatever difference of character might really exi&s;t, in the interchange of the common|place civilities of an a&s;&s;embled intercour&s;e, little difference could appear. But here, where, in the freedom and familiarity of behaviour that pre|vailed, every vicious principle &s;eemed to be di&s;|played, and every depravity of the heart to be laid open&mdash;here indeed there was a decided di&s;tinc|tion. When &s;he conver&s;ed with Henry, no cold|ne&s;s &s;at upon her brow, or re&s;trained her tongue, Her heart was upon her lips. The &s;mile of ap|probation dimpled in her cheek, and &s;parkled in her eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="036127_0207_100850B5B08CB600">Henry came immediately from Groby Manor to Stanton Park. Of Groby Manor, of her father, of her &s;i&s;ters, of her beloved Thorntons, &s;he was never weary of talking. There was no inquiry relative to all the&s;e, which was too minute, no circum&s;tance which was not intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>In the&s;e conver&s;ations, it is true, Ellen wi&s;hed nothing &s;o much as that &s;ir William &s;hould par|take; for &s;he wi&s;hed nothing &s;o much as that they &s;hould be equally important to him. But the vivacity which the arrival of Henry &s;eemed to have in&s;pired her with, was a mortal offence to &s;ir William, and a confirmation, "Strong as proof of Holy Writ," of all he had before &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>From this period the mo&s;t deadly hatred &s;uc|ceeded in the brea&s;t of &s;ir William, to that love which he had once felt for Ellen: and from this period he nouri&s;hed the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution of revenge.</P>
<P>But &s;ir William was indeed capable of that hypocri&s;y, of which he mo&s;t unju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected Ellen. The dread he entertained of being marked as a jealous hu&s;band, enabled him to di&s;&s;emble, even with her, the pangs which wrung his very &s;oul.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of the conduct he had manife&s;ted in town, he continued his newly re&s;umed fondne&s;s; frequently made Henry the object of his pa|negyric; pointed out to her his &s;uperiority to tho&s;e around him; &s;hewed a plea&s;ure in his conver&s;a|tion; and always &s;ought to make Ellen a party in it. To this depth of di&s;&s;imulation he was in&s;ti|gated, not only by a de&s;ire to e&s;cape the ridicule of jealou&s;y, but by a hope, that by thus la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;u&s;picion a&s;leep both in the minds of Henry and Ellen, he &s;hould attain a certainty of that, which
<PB N="210" REF="036127_0208_100850B737C52D08">
though he did not doubt, he could by no means prove: and nothing &s;hort of proof he knew could bear him out, even in his own opinion, in the cour&s;e he was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The art of &s;ir William was much more than a match for the ingenuous innocence of Ellen. She entertained not a doubt but that he was convinced of the inju&s;tice of his former &s;u&s;picions: and the moment &s;he believed &s;uch &s;u&s;picions were aban|doned, &s;he &s;incerely forgave them. She con|ceived, that he really was well &s;atisfied that &s;he &s;hould entertain and manife&s;t towards Henry, that cou&s;inly regard which &s;he had never di&s;avowed, but which, on the contrary, &s;he had always de|clared &s;he &s;hould carry to her grave. On the &s;tricte&s;t examination of her heart, &s;he di&s;covered nothing in her &s;entiments for Henry which &s;he could wi&s;h to conceal: and when &s;he beheld, as &s;he believed, &s;ir William relieved from every jea|lous doubt, &s;he had on this &s;ubject nothing farther to wi&s;h. Henry too appeared to have recovered his natural tone of mind: and Ellen &s;ecretly con|gratulated her&s;elf on the accompli&s;hment of tho&s;e hopes, which had cheered the darke&s;t gloom of her former &s;orrows.</P>
<P>Ellen's temper was &s;anguine. There were mo|ments in which &s;he could have believed any thing as certain, which it was po&s;&s;ible the united efforts of virtue and good &s;en&s;e could produce.</P>
<P>"Now," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "I &s;ee Henry happy. Sir William will in time be all I wi&s;h him&punc; His love for me will be as rational as it is tender. He will de&s;erve and I will give him my whole heart. After all my &s;orrows, and all my apprehen&s;ions, there will not be a happier lot than the one I have drawn."</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="036127_0209_100850B9F83BC080">It depended wholly on &s;ir William to have realized this picture of happine&s;s. He cho&s;e to convert it into &s;cenes of the mo&s;t genuine wretch|edne&s;s.</P>
<P>The delight with which &s;uch thoughts often filled the mind of Ellen, as &s;he &s;at conver&s;ing with &s;ir William and Henry, frequently &s;pread an ineffable air of &s;atisfaction and tenderne&s;s over her features. Henry at the&s;e moments beheld her as the image of virtue it&s;elf; and &s;ir William re|garded her as the mo&s;t abandoned of her &s;ex. "The time will come," thought he, "the time will come!"&mdash;and in this thought he was able to repre&s;s the re&s;entment which &s;welled his heart almo&s;t to breaking.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k, however, of di&s;&s;imulation, at length became too painful: and he longed to begin the period of puni&s;hment and vengeance. Ellen was to lye-in in town: and to town for this purpo&s;e &s;he removed about the beginning of February.</P>

<P>"Our readers will immediately a&s;&s;ociate with Mr, Southey's name, the Epic Poem which he lately publi&s;hed, Joan of Arc. From that dignified and difficult &s;pecies of compo&s;ition, he has de&s;cended to amu&s;e him&s;elf with the&s;e ea&s;ier and more artle&s;s &s;trains: and we are happy to remark, that the &s;ame lively fancy, the &s;ame delicacy of &s;entiment, the &s;ame melodious flow of language, which marked that rapid production, and diverted the attention from &s;ome of cen&s;urable defects, may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed in the little volume that now lies before us.</P>

<HEAD>3. LETTERS FROM A FATHER TO HIS SON, on various Topics relative to Literature and the Con|duct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793. By J. AIKEN, M. D. <HI>Printed on fine wove paper, price one dollar.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"The letters now before us, are the production of a mind endued with an uncommon &s;hare of penetration, long exer|ci&s;ed in the habit of accurate di&s;crimination and deep reflection, both with re&s;pect to &s;ubjects of &s;peculation, and to human life and manners; and firmly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that manly independence of character, which enables the inquirer to pur&s;ue truth wherever &s;he is to be found, and to follow her lead wherever &s;he leads.</P>
<P>"The author, Dr. Aiken, has already acquired no incon&s;ider|able degree of celebrity by his former u&s;eful and elegant pro|ductions, in &s;everal different walks of &s;cience and literature. The pre&s;ent work, while it affords new proofs, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uperior talents, and uncommon correctne&s;s of ta&s;te, will ex|hibit him to the public, under the highly re&s;pectable charac|ters of a judicious ob&s;erver, and a &s;age advi&s;er. Agreeably to his motto, '<HI>Liberi &s;en&s;i, &s;emplice parole,</HI>' he has thought clo&s;ely on a great variety of &s;ubjects, without &s;uffering him&s;elf to be

&s;hackled by &s;y&s;tems, or led by authority; and he has commu|nicated his thoughts, for the mo&s;t part, in plain and &s;imple, but always in pure cla&s;&s;ical language, perfectly &s;uitable to the form under which tho&s;e papers appear as letters to his &s;on.</P>
<P>"After the full detail we have given of the leading ideas and &s;entiments of the&s;e excellent letters, it is wholly unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing farther in their commendation; only we mu&s;t add, that they are, in our opinion, particularly de&s;erving the attention of young men, as happily adapted to &s;ugge&s;t to them important and plea&s;ing topics of inquiry and reflection; to exerci&s;e their judgment, and improve their ta&s;te; and to fur|ni&s;h them with u&s;eful hints for the conduct of life.'</P>

<P>"There is &s;carcely any ta&s;k which lays &s;ociety under higher obligations, than that which has for its object the mental and moral improvement of the ri&s;ing generation. In the&s;e Letters, which appear to have brought to a clo&s;e the parental duties of the author towards his &s;on, we trace much of Philo&s;ophy and true ta&s;te; and we are no le&s;s inclined to expect good con&s;e|quences from the example he him&s;elf has &s;et to all parents, than from the whole&s;ome precepts he &s;o judiciou&s;ly inculcates.</P>

<P>FROM the in&s;tant of their quitting Stanton Park, Sir William's behaviour was entirely changed. He &s;eemed not now to wi&s;h to di&s;|gui&s;e the ill opinion he had formed of her. He reproached her explicitly for the plea&s;ure &s;he had manife&s;ted in the company of Henry: and he openly exulted in the art with which he had laid her caution u&s;ele&s;s, and by which he had been able to a&s;certain her real &s;entiments.</P>

which involved no criminality. She had con&s;i|dered every mark of regard which &s;he had &s;hewn to Henry, as &s;anctioned by Sir William's expre&s;s approbation; and &s;he knew it did not contain a particle of that kind of love which the mo&s;t ex|tended of his rights could prohibit.</P>
<P>The re&s;entments of Ellen were always &s;hort-lived: and even before &s;he had voice to reply to Sir William's injuries, &s;he felt &s;omewhat like compa&s;&s;ion, though perhaps a little mingled with contempt, ri&s;e in her mind towards him.</P>
<P>'That it can &s;uit your ideas of honour and tenderne&s;s,' &s;aid &s;he, 'to endeavour to betray tho&s;e whom you are bound to defend, is what I can only be &s;incerely &s;orry for.

<P>Sir William trembled with pa&s;&s;ion. The truth

fla&s;hed upon him&mdash;it was the lightning's fla&s;h, that &s;trikes and kills. To believe him&s;elf alone accountable for the lo&s;s of Ellen's true affec|tions, was a pang of &s;uch intolerable angui&s;h, as human nature could not bear. To think her fal&s;e and worthle&s;s, was a &s;uffering of a milder kind. Barring his mind again&s;t conviction, he gave way to a rage which was only a temporary a&s;&s;uagement of his &s;ufferings, the &s;ource in fu|ture of the bittere&s;t &s;elf-reproach.</P>
<P>The agitation that his violence occa&s;ioned to Ellen, threw her into labour. Her &s;ituation be|came critical and hazardous, in a very high de|gree: and Sir William would have almo&s;t con|&s;ented to &s;ee her in the arms of Mr. Villars, to be a&s;&s;ured of her life. It was not, however, by the death of Ellen, that heaven had determined to puni&s;h Sir William. She was delivered of a boy, and declared out of danger.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the varied angui&s;h, compo&s;ed of grief, terror, and re&s;entment, that filled the mind of Ellen, &s;he experienced, as &s;he cla&s;ped her child to her bo&s;om, a &s;ource of joy, which no misfortune, that threatened her&s;elf alone, could embitter. Yet &s;he regretted but the more, that, in the father of her infant, &s;he could not love the hu&s;band of her choice.</P>
<P>Sir William, under pretence of guarding her from every emotion that might be prejudicial, ab&s;ented him&s;elf for &s;ome days from her apart|ment: and Ellen made u&s;e of this in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to bring her mind into &s;uch a &s;tate of ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty with him, as would enable her to receive him, when they did meet, with a kindne&s;s, which might

<P>She pre&s;ented his &s;on to him, with a faint &s;mile, &s;aying: 'Let this be the pledge of ob|livion for all that is pa&s;&s;ed, and the a&s;&s;urance of an unbroken amity for the time to come.'</P>
<P>'A &s;on!' &s;aid Sir William, looking earne&s;tly in the boy's face.</P>
<P>'Did you not know it was a boy?' &s;aid El|len.</P>
<P>'Yes,' returned Sir William, and again re|peated, 'A &s;on!'</P>
<P>'Dear Sir William, take your child into your arms. The touch of his lips will bani&s;h every unea&s;y thought. I have found them a &s;overeign panacea.'</P>
<P>'So might I too!&mdash;'</P>
<P>'Why do you not try then?'</P>
<P>'No; it is a woman's remedy.'</P>
<P>'It is a <HI>parent's,</HI>' returned Ellen.</P>
<P>'True,' &s;aid Sir William; but he touched not the child.</P>
<P>Ellen, pained, wondering, confu&s;ed, by a va|riety of indi&s;tinct thoughts, ha&s;tily &s;natched the boy to her heart, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>Sir William alarmed, tried to &s;oothe her by every tender expre&s;&s;ion he could think of; but he did not care&s;s the child. Nor did he appear to regard it either as a pledge of oblivion, or as an a&s;&s;urance of amity.</P>
<P>Ellen recovered &s;lowly: the anxiety of her mind affected her body. She &s;aw Sir William gloomy and di&s;contented: and though he re&s;train|ed him&s;elf from acts or words of ill humour or

reproach, the &s;ame dark &s;u&s;picions &s;eemed to lour in his mind, and the &s;ame re&s;entment to po&s;&s;e&s;s his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Ellen was now able to go out in her carriage&punc; and &s;he thought it proper no longer to delay mak|ing Sir William acquainted with the re&s;olution &s;he had formed. It was not long before he gave her an opportunity of doing &s;o.</P>
<P>On meeting her one day on her return from an airing, he ob&s;erved, that the colour began to return to her cheek, and the u&s;ual life to appear in her eye: and he added, in a cold and reproach|ful tone, 'You will &s;oon be able to return to &s;ociety. You will &s;oon be able to &s;ee <HI>all</HI> your friends.'</P>
<P>'I have a very few words to &s;ay, Sir Wil|liam, on that &s;ubject,' returned Ellen: 'and if you are at lei&s;ure, be kind enough to hear them now.'</P>
<P>'You are not going to make me a &s;peech?'</P>
<P>'I do not deal in oratory,' replied Ellen. What I have to &s;ay, will be compri&s;ed in a very few words.'</P>
<P>'Well, Mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m, cried he, with an air of provoking mockery, 'I attend.'</P>
<P>'When fir&s;t I was made &s;en&s;ible of the un|ju&s;t ideas that you entertained of my character,' &s;aid Ellen, 'I was led to hope that &s;uch jealou&s;y might only be the exuberancy of too ardent a love: and I tru&s;ted to that love and my own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|titude for the remedy. When I had rea&s;on to think the evil had a deeper root, that it &s;pring from the con&s;titution of your mind, and that, perhaps, you could not change it, I offered with the mo&s;t genuine &s;incerity, to withdraw with you

from the whole world, and to live only for you. This was treated as the flight of an ab&s;urd and romantic mind: and I was enjoined to conduct my&s;elf to all with whom I conver&s;ed, without di&s;tinction. I obeyed this injunction as far as it was po&s;&s;ible to obey it.

What I once a&s;&s;umed as a kindne&s;s to you, I now a&s;k as a favour and &s;helter for my&s;elf. I will not again join any &s;ociety, I will not again &s;ee any friends, that can awaken injurious doubts in your brea&s;t. If it is your will, that I &s;hall remain in town, I will remain there as a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in my own hou&s;e.

<P>Sir William appeared &s;truck with the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, by the calm and impre&s;&s;ive &s;tate|ment, that Ellen thus made of her wrongs, and of her conduct. Some purpo&s;e labouring in his mind, &s;eemed, in &s;pite of him&s;elf, to be &s;u&s;pended by the power of truth.</P>

<P>'Yes, to queen it there&mdash;to court popularity by in&s;idious charities&mdash;to form a party of the &s;cum of the earth&mdash;to build your reputation on the downfall of mine.'</P>

<BIBL>MASON.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN a few days, Ellen left town, for Oakley, taking her beloved boy with her. He &s;eemed the only human being whom &s;he might love un|reproved, or at lea&s;t the only one for whom her affections were not embittered by &s;ome painful reflection.</P>
<P>She could not conceal from her&s;elf, that Sir William &s;tudiou&s;ly held her apart from her fa|mily: and he had &s;o profe&s;&s;edly &s;et his face again&s;t Mi&s;s Thornton, that, except one &s;ingle fortnight which &s;he had &s;pent at Oakley, Ellen ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not &s;een her &s;ince her marriage; nor was he more willing that either of her &s;i&s;ters &s;hould be with her: and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the early days of the break|ing out of his di&s;content, he had reproached her for loving her father with a warmer affection than &s;he loved him.</P>
<P>With lady Almeria, who was always &s;urround|ed by a &s;ociety in which he him&s;elf found plea|&s;ure, and whom he knew Ellen could not love&mdash; and with her brother, who &s;hewed not much love to her, he &s;uffered her to a&s;&s;ociate with that degree of familiarity which the nearne&s;s of their
<PB N="15" REF="036127_0227_100850ED7951FB10">
connection warranted&punc; but he held her as much as po&s;&s;ible aloof from the whole world be&s;ides. He wi&s;hed her to be always in company: but he would have had the promi&s;cuous croud with which he had &s;urrounded her, wholly and alike indifferent to her.</P>
<P>A mode of life, in which the affections had no &s;hare, would have been, in it&s;elf, extremely irk&s;ome to Ellen; and when joined to the more po&s;itive evils that Sir William &s;pared not to in|flict, became in&s;upportable. At Oakley, &s;he &s;eemed to repo&s;e as in a &s;ecure harbour, after having been long to&s;&s;ed in &s;torms that threatened &s;hipwreck.</P>
<P>She nur&s;ed her boy: and this was one rea&s;on that was given to the world for her retiring to the country at that &s;ea&s;on of the year when eve|ry body el&s;e was flocking to town. This occu|pation was a perpetual &s;ource of delight and in|tere&s;t to her. Alone at Oakley, &s;he could dedi|cate the whole of her time and her thoughts to &s;o delightful a care: and &s;he &s;aw, or fancied &s;he &s;aw, in the &s;tout limbs, and intelligent &s;park|ling eyes of her darling, the proof and reward of her more than common love.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria had dragged her poor little baby to town with her, where neglect and want of good air &s;oon reduced it to a very pitiable object. Ellen was told it was ill, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arne&s;tly entreated Lady Almeria to let it join the nur&s;ery at Oak|ley. To this reque&s;t &s;he readily acceded; and the little Almeria was &s;ent down into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hire&punc; to add to the cares and plea&s;ures of Ellen.</P>
<P>With her two children, and the various means of occupation which her under&s;tanding and her
<PB N="16" REF="036127_0228_100850F075127CA0">
heart provided her with, Ellen began to regain a degree of ea&s;e and happine&s;s, which, except at very &s;hort intervals, had been long a &s;tranger to her bo&s;om. All remains of re&s;entment towards Sir William entirely &s;ub&s;ided. She again flattered her&s;elf, that if &s;he could once in&s;pire him with a ta&s;te for the calm delights of the country, &s;he might be able in time to correct his unhappy aptitude to &s;u&s;picion, to eradicate all jealou&s;y from his mind, and, making him worthy of her love, to love him with an affection more rea&s;onable, and as warm as any he had ever felt for her. She congratulated her&s;elf on the part &s;he had taken; and was ready to per&s;uade her&s;elf that her pa&s;t vexations were only a more certain road to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>She wrote to Sir William frequently, detailing all &s;he did, and recounting the wittici&s;ms of Almeria, who, however, could not yet &s;peak, and the wonderful tricks and achievements of her boy. In return, Sir William's letters were &s;hort, con|taining little but the anecdote of the day, and never replied in any way to the dome&s;tic and nur&s;ery &s;tories which made the &s;ubject of Ellen's.</P>
<P>Ellen was willing to lay all this in&s;en&s;ibility to the way of life Sir William was engaged in, &s;o unfavourable to the feelings of the parent and the hu&s;band; and to hope the cure for all lay in his being made &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ible of the &s;uperior plea&s;ure that could ari&s;e from &s;uch feelings, to that which every other gratification apart from them could be&s;tow.

<P>WHILE Ellen was thus indulging her&s;elf in every virtuous propen&s;ity, and already began to reap the reward that u&s;ually attends the gratifi|cation of &s;uch propen&s;ities, Henry was a prey to the mo&s;t tormenting di&s;quietude.</P>
<P>On his arrival in town, he had learned Ellen's removal into the country: and he had heard a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for it, her own health, which had &s;uffered much from her confinement, and the cares &s;he had taken upon her, with re&s;pect to her boy. Nothing could appear more natural than the&s;e rea&s;ons: and with Henry, who knew Ellen's di&s;po&s;ition, they would have found, but for one circum&s;tance, a mo&s;t ready belief.</P>
<P>Sir William's conduct during the time they had all pa&s;&s;ed in Devon&s;hire together, had completely deceived him. He believed that Sir William felt for Ellen all the love that &s;he was &s;o well formed to in&s;pire: and he never had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that Ellen did not rejoice in and return his love. But in Henry's opinion, it ill con&s;i&s;ted with &s;uch a mutual affection, that Sir William &s;hould &s;uffer Ellen to go without him into the country, in circum&s;tances in which &s;he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be &s;uppo&s;ed particularly to call for more than common atten|tion,
<PB N="18" REF="036127_0230_100850F4BA2AEA38">
or that he could con&s;ent &s;o &s;oon to lo&s;e &s;ight of their fir&s;t pledge of love; a boy too, which is generally as dear to a father as a mother.</P>
<P>It was this circum&s;tance that rai&s;ed a &s;u&s;picion in the mind of Henry, that there was &s;omething more in Ellen's pre&s;ent retirement than the world in general believed. Yet was he cautious in his endeavours to di&s;cover whether his &s;u&s;picions were grounded in truth, le&s;t he &s;hould commu|nicate &s;imilar doubts to others.</P>
<P>He threw him&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible in the way of Sir William, who pre&s;erved towards him the manners he had held when they were together in Devon&s;hire: it being Sir William's unalterable re&s;olution, even in the vengeance that he medi|tated again&s;t Ellen, that the world &s;hould never know that he had entertained a &s;u&s;picion of her virtue or her love.</P>
<P>Sir William would often &s;peak of Ellen, would mention the partiality &s;he entertained for a coun|try life, the new-born attachment to her boy, which &s;eemed to &s;wallow up every other affec|tion: and &s;ometimes he would lament that it deprived him&s;elf, and the re&s;t of her friends, of her company in town.</P>
<P>Henry upon the&s;e occa&s;ions was &s;trongly tempted to a&s;k, what could detain him there, while Ellen was in the country: but as he could not forget, neither could he hope, that Sir Wil|liam could forget the connection that had once been between Ellen and him&s;elf. The remem|brance of this connection impo&s;ed a &s;crupulous delicacy upon him, whenever he mentioned El|len to Sir Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="036127_0231_100850F64D5B8E40">As it was a &s;ubject he never began, &s;o it was one that he always put an end to as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Sir William perceived this &s;hyne&s;s and imputed it to the wor&s;t of motives. From a re&s;tle&s;s de|&s;ire to di&s;cover what he dreaded to a&s;certain, he &s;carcely ever &s;aw Henry without introducing, in &s;ome way or other, the &s;ubject of Ellen's retire|ment: and Henry at length began to think there was &s;omething of affectation, or de&s;ign, in this.</P>
<P>While Henry's mind was in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, Lady Almeria awakened him to a much more lively &s;u&s;picion of the truth.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria's own attendant was cou&s;in 'to the woman who waited upon Ellen. They were both Northumberland girls: and Ellen's &s;ervant had &s;pent all her life, 'till taken into Ellen's &s;er|vice, within a bow-&s;hot of Groby Manor.</P>
<P>Hence &s;he could tell of the early love between her lady and Mr. Villars, of the cruelties of Lord Villars, the di&s;tre&s;s of the lovers, the &s;ud|den appearance of Henry on the eve of Ellen's marriage, with every circum&s;tance relating to the affair that was made public, and with many that had never happened, and which were reported from mi&s;apprehen&s;ion and conjecture.</P>
<P>It was from her knowledge of much that re|ally had pa&s;&s;ed, and from her belief in &s;till more that never pa&s;&s;ed, that &s;he had drawn the con|clu&s;ion that Ellen would never love Sir William. Thus from the day of her marriage &s;he never &s;aw a &s;hade of di&s;content upon Ellen's brow, that &s;he did not impute (according to the cham|ber-maid-like idea of the invincibility of a fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion) to her having been cro&s;&s;ed in love.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="036127_0232_100850FA2D1D2220">With a mind thus pre-occupied by this fancy, it was not po&s;&s;ible, that the whole of Sir Wil|liam's unkindne&s;s, and its effects upon Ellen, &s;hould be entirely concealed from her. What &s;he fell &s;hort of in real knowledge, &s;he made up in conjecture: and all &s;he conjectured &s;he reported as fact.&mdash;Much of it, indeed, was &s;o; though &s;he did not know it.</P>
<P>Ellen having left &s;ome books in town, locked up in a cabinet, of which &s;he had the key with her in the country, about this time &s;ent her maid to town to bring them to her.</P>
<P>Jenny, who had her mind full of all that &s;he believed had happened in Sir William's family &s;ince &s;he la&s;t &s;aw her cou&s;in, made u&s;e of &s;ome of the few hours that &s;he &s;pent in town, in a vi&s;it to Lady Almeria's hou&s;e: and there &s;he fully detailed to her &s;i&s;ter go&s;&s;ip, all &s;he knew, and all &s;he believed &s;he knew.</P>
<P>She told of Ellen's violent illne&s;s, immediately following an angry conver&s;ation with Sir Wil|liam. She repeated &s;ome words &s;he had acciden|tally overheard. She dwelt on the length of time which he had ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the apart|ment of Ellen&mdash;on the di&s;like that he &s;eemed to have to the child&mdash;on the grief that &s;he had often witne&s;&s;ed in Ellen's countenance and manner&mdash;on the unkindne&s;s of Sir William, in never having once vi&s;ited Oakley &s;ince Ellen had retired thither &mdash;and on the contentment and ea&s;e which Ellen &s;eemed to experience, notwith&s;tanding his ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances, tho&s;e two Ma|chiavels concluded, with a certainty, that le&s;t no room for doubt, that Sir William was jealous of
<PB N="21" REF="036127_0233_100850FF67F2BAF8">
Mr. Villars; that he had bani&s;hed Ellen into the country to prevent their meeting; and that Ellen had more &s;atisfaction alone, and left to the re|membrance of her fir&s;t love, than, from the unkindne&s;s and &s;u&s;picion of Sir William, &s;he had ever enjoyed in the world, and in his &s;ociety.</P>
<P>As Jenny &s;incerely loved her mi&s;tre&s;s, all Ellen did was right in her eyes: and if &s;he had been employed by her in carrying on an intercour&s;e with Henry, &s;he would ea&s;ily have excu&s;ed her on the &s;core of the unconquerable nature of a fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, and the provocation received from a jealous hu&s;band; &s;uch circum&s;tances forming a &s;pecies of apology, that in vulgar minds is a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for every enormity.</P>
<P>But as Jenny thought Ellen extremely injured, &s;o &s;he knew her to be perfectly innocent: and hence &s;he painted her as the mo&s;t patient &s;uf|ferer, and Sir William as the wor&s;t and mo&s;t unkind of human creatures.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria's woman had often heard her Lady expre&s;s &s;omewhat of contempt, and a good deal of &s;urpri&s;e, on Ellen's withdrawing from town at that &s;ea&s;on of the year: and &s;he had heard her throw out, as no improbable &s;uppo&s;i|tion, that it was contrary to her own wi&s;h, and the effect of Sir William's arbitrary jealou&s;y. She had, however, al&s;o heard her declare, that &s;he was not in the &s;ecret, and did not in fact really know what the cau&s;e was.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria, among her other foibles, had that mo&s;t pernicious one of bu&s;ying her&s;elf much in the affairs of others. She had always taken upon her to foretell that the marriage of Ellen with Sir William would end ill; and &s;he looked with
<PB N="22" REF="036127_0234_10085101081AFF38">
&s;ome degree of eagerne&s;s for every circum&s;tance that could tend to prove that her predictions were fulfilled.</P>
<P>From the&s;e defects in Lady Almeria's charac|ter, Betty always found her&s;elf well li&s;tened to when &s;he talked of the characters of her Lady's acquaintance, or repeated anecdotes out of their re&s;pective families.</P>
<P>All, therefore, that &s;he had heard from her cou&s;in, was mo&s;t eagerly poured out as a torrent, the next time &s;he attended upon Lady Almeria: and it was poured out with all tho&s;e exaggera|tions and embelli&s;hments that &s;o readily occur to every relator of every &s;tory, who wi&s;hes to make the mo&s;t of what is to be told. Every thing that Betty related, found ready credence with Lady Almeria: and in a few hours after &s;he had heard the &s;tory, meeting with Henry:</P>
<P>'Now,' &s;aid &s;he, 'I can clear up the won|derment of Lady Ackland's running away from us in &s;uch a &s;trange manner. That brute, Sir William, is jealous of you: and he means to confine Ellen to Oakley as long as &s;he lives. And woe be to you both, if you approach the thre&s;hold!'</P>
<P>Henry turned pale as death.</P>
<P>'Let me beg, Lady Almeria,' &s;aid he, 'that you will not indulge your&s;elf in &s;uch wild fancies, &mdash;much le&s;s repeat them.'</P>
<P>'Oh! you don't believe me?&mdash;Come this way then; and I will give you &s;uch a proof as will clear my veracity in a moment.'</P>
<P>'Why &s;hould I be convinced of what would give me inexpre&s;&s;ible pain to believe?'</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="036127_0235_100851039C490720">'It cannot give you more pain than it does me. I have been in a perfect fidget ever &s;ince I heard it. I am &s;ure I dare not tell Mr. Mor|daunt half: he'd be for cutting Sir William's throat, or &s;ome &s;uch thing, for you never heard of &s;uch a dragon.'</P>
<P>Henry's curio&s;ity now got the better of his prudence: and he li&s;tened to all Lady Almeria had to tell. But with what emotions he li&s;tened to it, it is not po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s. His whole frame trembled: and his agitation was &s;o great, that lady Almeria began to repent that &s;he had cho&s;en a public a&s;&s;embly for &s;uch a communica|tion.</P>
<P>'Come, I will tell you more,' &s;aid &s;he. 'How you do love this Ellen &s;till! I do not be|lieve there is &s;uch another con&s;tant &s;wain in the bills of mortality.'</P>
<P>'I mu&s;t know all now,' &s;aid Henry, 'co&s;t me what it will. You have &s;et me on the rack.'</P>
<P>'But I dare not. It will be you that will be for cutting Sir William's throat at this rate.'</P>
<P>'No, I have no &s;uch thoughts. Sir William will live &s;afe from my vengeance. But what is there more to hear?'</P>
<P>'Ble&s;s me, not much. It is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e what a jealous, an unrea&s;onable man will &s;ay and do. But Ellen is &s;o re&s;erved that I don't find &s;he has ever complained, even to her maid.'</P>
<P>'Complained!&mdash;To her maid!&mdash;' repeat|ed Henry. 'No, Ellen knows how to &s;uffer, but not to complain.'</P>
<P>'And &s;o &s;he will have no redre&s;s! I &s;ee no mighty wi&s;dom in that. Were I in her place I would complain, and loudly too. Men may be

managed by their fears: and Sir William would not dare to u&s;e her &s;o, if he thought &s;he would expo&s;e his conduct to the world.'</P>
<P>Henry was in no humour to di&s;cu&s;s the pro|priety of &s;uch maxims: and finding he could draw no farther particulars from Lady Almeria, he earne&s;tly recommended what yet he could not hope &s;he would practi&s;e, the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ilence; and withdrew with a heart oppre&s;&s;ed almo&s;t beyond &s;ufferance.</P>
<P>Although Mr. Villars was well aware of the &s;u&s;picious quarter from which he had received his intelligence&mdash;and though in any matter where the happine&s;s of Ellen had not been concerned, &s;uch evidence as that on which it re&s;ted, would not have fixed any circum&s;tance for a moment in his thoughts&mdash;yet in a ca&s;e where &s;o much was at &s;take, his apprehen&s;ions gave credibility to the mo&s;t doubtful te&s;timony: and this te&s;timony &s;eem|ed to be confirmed by &s;everal particulars, of the truth of which he could not entertain a doubt.</P>
<P>He knew the &s;udden and dangerous illne&s;s of Ellen, which was now a&s;cribed to Sir William's violence, to be a fact: and he had before been told, that it had been occa&s;ioned by a fright. It was al&s;o certain, that &s;he had retired into the coun|try, and that Sir William &s;o far from accom|panying her, had never even vi&s;ited her &s;ince her re&s;idence there. The frequent, and what now more than ever appeared to be officious conver&s;a|tions, with him upon this &s;ubject, returned with added effect upon his mind: and he felt per|&s;uaded, that they had been held with a de&s;ign to confirm or do away &s;u&s;picions which he was now convinced Sir William had entertained.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="036127_0237_100851096429F328">The&s;e &s;u&s;picions &s;eemed, it is true, ill to agree with the friendly and open conduct he had held towards him while in Devon&s;hire; or with the continuation of the &s;ame in their intercour&s;e in town. But Henry could not help fearing, that this conduct, which might be u&s;ed as a cloak to his real thoughts, was rather a proof that the evil lay deep, than that it did not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>A thou&s;and &s;chemes did he revolve in his mind as to what he could or ought to do towards the di&s;covery of the truth; and towards the allevia|tion of the evil, if it did &s;ub&s;i&s;t. But to every one he found in&s;upportable objections; and was obliged to re&s;t in the conclu&s;ion, however con|trary to his wi&s;hes he might find it, that the &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t cour&s;e he could pur&s;ue, was to do noth|ing.</P>
<P>Impelled, however, by feelings very &s;imilar, Sir William and he met continually. Their minds were equally occupied by the &s;ame &s;ubject; and though both were &s;hy in their manner of treating it, they found no intere&s;t in any other.</P>
<P>Henry ob&s;erved that Sir William enquired fre|quently into his motions; and remarked, that he was particularly inqui&s;itive whether his love for hunting did not carry him often to the Lodge. Henry was &s;ometimes, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, be|trayed, by his eagerne&s;s to do away all &s;u&s;picion in Sir William's mind, into a minutene&s;s of detail and a warmth of denial, that rather &s;eemed as the cover to the truth, than the &s;imple declara|tion of it.</P>
<P>Seldom, therefore, did Sir William and Henry conver&s;e together without Henry being more than ever convinced of the jealou&s;y Sir William had

co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ceived, and Sir William confirmed in the ju&s;|tice of it.</P>
<P>By the&s;e conver&s;ations, and the reflections Sir William made upon them, his mind was at length wrought up to &s;uch a pitch of mi&s;ery and indig|nation, that he re&s;olved to withhold the meditated revenge no longer: but, preparatory to the blow he intended to &s;trike, it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee Ellen, and lull her if po&s;&s;ible into perfect &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he no longer delayed to vi&s;it Oakley. There, however, &s;uch a &s;cene awaited him, as again broke in upon all his de&s;igns, and &s;u&s;pended his mind once more in the agitating balance of uncertainty.</P>

<Q><L>'What angel &s;hall</L>
<L>"Ble&s;s this unworthy hu&s;band? He cannot thrive!'</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SIR WILLIAM found Ellen blooming with health, and her ingenuous countenance marked with the placid look of content, which virtue only can impre&s;s. He found her bu&s;ied in every rural and every dome&s;tic care, living with the children perpetually in her arms, occupied wholly with them, and apparently without a thought which wandered from the environs of Oakley.</P>
<P>He was received by her with &s;uch marks of genuine &s;atisfaction, as &s;eemed not to leave a doubt but that he was truly welcome to her, and that it would be his own fault if he did not derive from her &s;ociety every happine&s;s he could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Such appearances were &s;o entirely incompati|ble with the guilt he had been &s;o ready to impute to her, as to compel him for &s;ome time, in &s;pite of him&s;elf, to do her ju&s;tice. Yet, if &s;he did not love Henry, how came &s;he to be &s;o happy in the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band? The an&s;wer that his con&s;cience forced from him to this que&s;tion, gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im a pang of &s;elf-reproach, that he knew not how to endure.</P>
<P>If her heart be not another's&mdash;yet I have lo&s;t it for ever, thought he. But no, it is in loving
<PB N="28" REF="036127_0240_10085112C1CD1710">
Henry that &s;he has cea&s;ed to love me. My con|duct towards her has ju&s;tified this dereliction in her eyes; and hence the ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction that appears in her countenance; hence the deep hypocri&s;y &s;he is enabled to maintain.</P>
<P>Such thoughts as the&s;e were &s;upplanted by others more worthy of Ellen: and the&s;e were again driven from his mind by fre&s;h &s;u&s;picions and new jealou&s;ies. What would he not have given for Morgana's cup, or the little boy's mantle.</P>
<P>Ellen remarked the perturbation of his mind: and &s;he &s;trove to allay it by the mo&s;t affectionate cheerfulne&s;s. It would not have been po&s;&s;ible to have &s;uppo&s;ed from any word or look that e&s;cap|ed Ellen, that &s;he had withdrawn into the coun|try to avoid the violent effects of the mo&s;t unju&s;t jealou&s;y; or that &s;he retained an atom of re&s;ent|ment for the injuries &s;he had received. A per|fect oblivion as to all that had pa&s;&s;ed before her removal to Oakley, &s;eemed to pervade her mind. She appeared willing to con&s;ider that period as a new epoch of her life, from which, if he plea&s;|ed, Sir William might date their mutual hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir William had now &s;pent three weeks in Berk&s;hire: and &s;o far had the mild and wi&s;e de|meanor of Ellen wrought upon his mind, that he began to con&s;ider all his pa&s;t fears but as the horrors of a frightful dream from which he was now awakened.</P>
<P>If he could always live with Ellen at Oakley, he thought he could &s;ubdue his jealou&s;y: but to live always at Oakley, even with an angel, was what little &s;uited his ta&s;te. It would not, how|ever,
<PB N="29" REF="036127_0241_100851144AC91BC0">
he knew, be difficult to per&s;uade Ellen to continue there altogether. This indeed appeared to be what &s;he de&s;ired: and if he could be a&s;&s;ured that &s;he lived there wholly to her&s;elf and chil|dren, he was willing to flatter him&s;elf, that the kindne&s;s with which he doubted not &s;he would always receive him when he cho&s;e to join her, would be &s;ufficient for his own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>To this &s;cheme of &s;elfi&s;h felicity there was only one objection aro&s;e in his mind: he feared there might be &s;ome my&s;tery in the choice Ellen &s;eemed to have made of Oakley for her re&s;idence. The neighbourhood of the Lodge recurred to his remembrance; and brought with it a &s;udden pang of jealou&s;y that made him &s;tart.</P>
<P>The experiment, however, he thought worth trying. If Ellen were innocent, &s;he might be &s;afely tru&s;ted at Oakley. If &s;he were guilty, the place of her abode was a matter of little con&s;e|quence. Time and ob&s;ervation could alone clear this important point: and to time and ob&s;erva|tion he re&s;olved to refer it.</P>
<P>Sir William was in this &s;tate of mind, not wholly cured of his &s;u&s;picions, and yet willing to believe them ill founded, when an event hap|pened, that &s;eemed to his di&s;turbed imagination to carry conviction with it. It fixed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> im|moveably in his plan of vengeance, and &s;ealed the de&s;tiny of Ellen.</P>
<P>Both the children were &s;eized at the &s;ame time with the mea&s;les: and the di&s;order put on its mo&s;t alarming form. Ellen di&s;patched a me&s;&s;en|ger in&s;tantly to Lady Almeria; and &s;hutting her|&s;elf up in the apartment with the children, watched them with equal and unremitted &s;olicitude. Be|fore
<PB N="30" REF="036127_0242_10085117908CD8D0">
Lady Almeria arrived, the little girl was apparently out of danger: but the boy continued in a &s;tate of the greate&s;t hazard.</P>
<P>Ellen, who had not a thought that &s;he could di&s;gui&s;e from him, did not ob&s;erve the almo&s;t undi&s;&s;embled indifference with which Sir William viewed the child's danger, and her &s;orrows. But it &s;truck every body el&s;e. Lady Almeria con&s;idered it as a full confirmation of all that &s;he had been told. She had promi&s;ed to inform Henry of the progre&s;s of the child's di&s;ea&s;e: and &s;he &s;crupled not to mention in the mo&s;t explicit terms, all the ob&s;ervations that &s;he had made on Sir William's conduct.</P>
<P>Henry was almo&s;t driven to di&s;traction with the idea of Ellen's &s;ufferings, and Sir William's cruelty: yet dur&s;t he not attempt to alleviate the one, or to puni&s;h the other. He could only en|treat Lady Almeria not to remit the frequency and particularity of her details: and he waited the event in town, with all the anxiety and per|turbation that he might have felt, had he been indeed the father of the child.</P>
<P>Not all the exertion of the be&s;t medical &s;kill, nor all poor Ellen's &s;olicitous and unwearied care, could prolong her darling's date on earth, or keep its &s;pirit one moment from its native &s;ky.&mdash; It died!&mdash;And Ellen remained a motionle&s;s image of de&s;pair, by the &s;ide of the bed on which it had expired.</P>
<P>Sir William had been out in his grounds; and, returning, entered the apartment to make his u&s;ual cold inquiry, in his accu&s;tomed words of, 'How go you on?'</P>
<P>'It is all over!' &s;aid Lady Almeria.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="036127_0243_100851196F204520">'Thank God!' &s;aid Sir William, and ru&s;hed out of the room.</P>
<P>Ellen looked up; and in&s;tantly &s;unk down &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and to all appearance lifele&s;s.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria's &s;hrieks brought Sir William back. 'You have murdered her&mdash;you have killed Ellen,' &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>No words can de&s;cribe Sir William's con&s;ter|nation. He hardly knew the force of the words that had e&s;caped him, and the effect they had had upon Ellen appeared incomprehen&s;ible. But the &s;ight of her, pale and breathle&s;s before him, drove him almo&s;t to in&s;tant madne&s;s. He caught her in his arms; and, eager to remove her from the chamber of death, carried her to her own apart|ment. There, while every method was u&s;ed to re&s;tore her, he threw him&s;elf on his knees before her, and, regardle&s;s of all pre&s;ent, earne&s;tly im|plored her forgivene&s;s, upbraiding him&s;elf as the mo&s;t cruel and unju&s;t of men, and promi&s;ed never-cea&s;ing love and confidence, if &s;he would but live to ble&s;s him.</P>
<P>Ellen opened her eyes. But, as if the &s;ight of Sir William was baneful to her, &s;he put her hands before them and wept bitterly.</P>
<P>Sir William ordered every body to retire.</P>
<P>'No! no! no!' &s;aid Ellen.</P>
<P>'Do you then hate me?' &s;aid Sir William, 'Dare you not tru&s;t your&s;elf with me?'</P>
<P>The&s;e words brought Ellen to her recollection. 'Do not talk &s;o, Sir William. But I am very ill. I want a&s;&s;i&s;tance?'</P>
<P>'I will a&s;&s;i&s;t you. I would give my life for yours: and do you refu&s;e to let me attend you&punc;</P>
<P>'Leave us,' &s;aid Ellen faintly.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="036127_0244_1008511E8F498B30">'Oh! Sir William,' &s;aid &s;he, when they were alone, 'what mean tho&s;e words of love, after you have given me &s;uch a proof of your deadly hatred?'</P>
<P>'A proof of deadly hatred!&mdash;Oh! Ellen, how you wrong me! what &s;en&s;e can you have put upon my words, to make you think them words of hatred?'</P>
<P>Ellen wept but could not &s;peak.</P>
<P>'The &s;ubject is too delicate,' continued Sir William, 'to explain upon. But is it an unpar|donable crime, when hope was extinct, to have been grateful that &s;uffering was no more?'</P>
<P>Ellen was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>'Deare&s;t Ellen, &s;ay, you mi&s;under&s;tood; that you are convinced. Do not per&s;i&s;t in an error &s;o injurious.'</P>
<P>'I cannot &s;peak. My heart is cruelly oppre&s;|&s;ed: but never need you dread inju&s;tice from me.'</P>
<P>'Then, my deare&s;t love, look upon me. Do not thus turn from me, as if the very &s;ight of me was hateful to you. Often have I given you cau&s;e of offence. Never did I find you unforgiving. Now when I would not offend you, be not le&s;s kind.'</P>
<P>'I would not think that there has been offence given. I would not think that there is room for forgivene&s;s.'</P>
<P>'Then, in this embrace, be all mi&s;apprehen|&s;ion forgotten. Be a&s;&s;ured, you cannot be grieved, without my taking a part in your affliction.'</P>
<P>'I will endeavour to believe it. But take it not unkindly, if I wi&s;h to be alone, I am very greatly afflicted. I cannot now make u&s;e of the full powers of my mind. I cannot at this mo|ment

be all you wi&s;h me to be, or all I ought to be. Let me recollect my&s;elf. I hope &s;oon to be re&s;igned to all the ill I am de&s;tined to &s;uffer, and alive to all the good that is &s;till afforded me.'</P>
<P>'May you con&s;ider my love,' &s;aid Sir William, embracing her, 'as the greate&s;t &s;hare of that good; and as a proof you do &s;o, do not bani&s;h me long from you.'</P>
<P>Sir William then left her, and endeavoured to calm the di&s;turbance of his mind, by per&s;uading him&s;elf that he had given &s;uch a &s;en&s;e to the unkind words that had e&s;caped him, as would effectually remove from the mind of Ellen all apprehen&s;ion of their real meaning.</P>
<P>Whatever were the &s;u&s;picions that had dictated the&s;e words, and whatever the impul&s;e to which he had yielded in uttering them, he was &s;en&s;ible there was a barbarity in their &s;ound, that no motive, and &s;carcely any offence, could ju&s;tify. He doubted not but Lady Almeria would repeat them: and he &s;aw his character at &s;take. In per&s;uading Ellen that they were only the effu&s;ion of compa&s;&s;ion, he knew he &s;ecured a warm ad|vocate: and in the kindne&s;s of their intercour&s;e he &s;aw a refutation of any cen&s;ure to which his unguardedne&s;s might have expo&s;ed him</P>
<P>The&s;e were the &s;elfi&s;h motives upon which his pre&s;ent conduct was founded. But he was not without a very &s;en&s;ible compunction for what had pa&s;&s;ed, and had a very lively intere&s;t in the &s;or|rows of Ellen. He had lately accu&s;tomed him|&s;elf to con&s;ider her as rather injured than injuring: and in this light he felt for her a revival of his fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion: and, mixed as it was, with pity to|wards her, and reproach to him&s;elf, the expre&s;&s;ions

of it were more lively and tender than even in the fir&s;t days of their marriage.</P>
<P>But Ellen's heart was no longer in a &s;tate to receive plea&s;ure from the love of Sir William. No explanation that he could give to words &s;o cruel and wounding, could do away the effect they had produced in her mind. Without fully under&s;tanding the feeling from whence they &s;prung, &s;he felt them as the greate&s;t and mo&s;t unprovoked unkindne&s;s he could have been guilty of. The carele&s;s indifference he had &s;hewn through the whole of the poor baby's illne&s;s, now ru&s;hed upon her recollection, and &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to believe that words &s;o &s;trong had ari&s;en only from a &s;udden impul&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ufferings to which he had &s;o long appeared in&s;en&s;ible. Yet why Sir William &s;hould rejoice in the death of his child, except becau&s;e it was the &s;ource of her pure&s;t delight, &s;he could not gue&s;s. She had often thought, that he had con|&s;idered the boy with jealou&s;y, as an object which had occupied that place in her heart, which he alone ought to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but for a jealou&s;y &s;o &s;elfi&s;h and unju&s;tifiable, with all her candour, &s;he could find no excu&s;e. A &s;entiment of di&s;gu&s;t and re&s;entment now therefore mingled with the deep grief of Ellen for the lo&s;s of her child; nor could all her efforts to &s;ubdue it, wholly &s;ucceed. But grief in this ca&s;e did more for her than rea&s;on. So overwhelming was her affliction, that it overcame every other feeling: and had the cau&s;e of the offence been unconnected with the &s;ubject of her &s;orrow, it would have been in&s;tantly obliterated from her mind.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE Ellen remained almo&s;t wholly ab&s;orb|ed in grief, a circum&s;tance happened, which broke in upon her affliction, and convinced her, that no &s;tate could be wholly wretched which afforded the benevolent heart an opportunity of admini&s;tering to the wants of others.</P>
<P>Her letters from Northumberland informed her, that the grand&s;on of her favourite protegee, Deborah, a young man di&s;tingui&s;hed for his in|telligence, hone&s;ty, and indu&s;try, had, from &s;ome unavoidable misfortunes, fallen into the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and that he, his wife, and two children, were in jail. Charlotte, who wrote the hi&s;tory, deplored the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of her father to afford any effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;o much unde|&s;erved mi&s;ery; as the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e was not &s;hort of two hundred pounds, a &s;um much too large for him to &s;pare from the immediate wants of his own family.</P>
<P>Ellen's heart &s;eemed to leap in her bo&s;om, when &s;he read this account. Sir William had always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tinued his u&s;ual allowance to her: and the little occa&s;ion &s;he had had for money for ma|ny months pa&s;t, had made her rich. By antici|pating

a part of her next quarterage, which might be made ea&s;y by a little future economy&punc; &s;he was able immediately to command two hundred pounds: and by the return of the po&s;t &s;he tran&s;|mitted a draft upon Sir William's banker for that &s;um.</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to attempt explaining the joy and gratitude of the family, who&s;e mi&s;eries &s;he reliev|ed. Their joy, however, was not &s;hort of her own; nor was her gratitude le&s;s when &s;he rai&s;|ed her thoughts to the Giver of all Good&mdash;the giver of that good which includes all other, the giver of a good heart. This tran&s;action &s;hed a calm over the mind of Ellen, and contributed more towards re&s;toring her to peace, than any gra|tification merely &s;elfi&s;h could have done.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria had been but too faithful a de|tailer to the wretched Henry of the whole &s;tory of the death of the child, and the con&s;equent &s;orrows of Ellen: and he felt on the communi|cation, his &s;ufferings increa&s;e to &s;o intolerable a degree, that he found it impo&s;&s;ible to forbear &s;ome effort towards their alleviation. Yet, when he con&s;idered that all his information came from La|dy Almeria, and reflected upon her unfeeling character, and the talent &s;he had in exaggeration, he thought it prudent to judge with his own eyes, and determine, by his own ob&s;ervation, before he took any &s;tep, the con&s;equence of which might involve the conduct of Ellen as well as his own.</P>
<P>Ellen, from the extent of her grief, which took in the whole of her mind, excep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what &s;he could &s;pare to the calls of benevolence, and from the gentlene&s;s of her temper, which forbade any

&s;harpne&s;s of re&s;entment, had been able to receive Sir William's attention and &s;olicitudes with &s;uch a degree of &s;atisfaction and gratitude, as &s;eemed to &s;peak to all lookers on, that perfect harmony was re&s;tored between them. Ellen had been al&s;o particularly &s;oftened towards Sir William by his genero&s;ity, unlike his u&s;ual character, towards the grand&s;on of poor Deborah. The circum|&s;tance of what Ellen had done for him came ac|cidentally to his knowledge: and he was too ac|cute not to perceive the favourable opportunity now in his power, of doing more towards rein|&s;tating him&s;elf in Ellen's favour, than all his &s;tu|died fondne&s;s to her&s;elf could ever have produced. He prai&s;ed, in the highe&s;t terms, Ellen's benevo|lence; and by imitating, give an irrefragable proof that he approved it. To the two hundred pounds he added another, as a means by which the young man might be enabled to enter the world again with &s;ome advantage.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, Ellen looked upon Sir Wil|liam with an air of the &s;weete&s;t complacency: and &s;he once more &s;aid to her&s;elf, his heart will at length open to the true u&s;e of riches. Our minds and our wi&s;hes will be in uni&s;on: and we &s;hall be happy.</P>
<P>Sir William had explained the offen&s;ive words to lady Almeria, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had explained them to Ellen: and he &s;ought more and more by the marks of the fonde&s;t love, and mo&s;t &s;incere participation in her pre&s;ent affliction, to prove that they could ju&s;tly bear no other &s;en&s;e. Ellen &s;eemed now to have forgiven, or at lea&s;t to have f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gotten all that had pa&s;&s;ed: and Lady Almeria now &s;aw nothing between Ellen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d

Sir William that could ju&s;tify her former opinion, or the tales of Jenny.</P>
<P>She was not, however, willing, notwith&s;tand|ing tho&s;e favourable appearances, to &s;uppo&s;e her|&s;elf mi&s;taken: and while &s;he acknowledged in her letters to Henry, the change that had taken place, &s;he &s;crupled not to impute it to the con|&s;ummate art of Sir William, who meant by this means to deceive her. For the truth of this conjecture &s;he appealed to the &s;orrow in which Ellen was &s;till plunged; and which, &s;he &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible to believe occa&s;ioned by the death of a brat not four months old.</P>
<P>But Henry, who &s;aw no &s;uch impo&s;&s;ibility, con&s;idering the peculiar circum&s;tances in which Ellen was placed, and feeling his hopes revive, that her &s;orrows did not wholly flow from &s;o irremediable a cau&s;e as he had been taught to believe, thought this a proper time, when Sir William was with her, and they appeared to be on perfect good terms with each other, to make u&s;e of his own ob&s;ervation to come at the truth if po&s;&s;ible. For this purpo&s;e he came down to the Lodge: and the next morning af|ter his arrival, walked over to Oakley. He had been told by Lady Almeria, that Ellen was &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed, that &s;he &s;eldom left her a|partment 'till two o'clock in the day: and he had therefore cho&s;en an hour for his fir&s;t vi&s;it, in which he believed he &s;hould only &s;ee Sir William.</P>
<P>He had cro&s;&s;ed a corner of the park, and had entered through a part of the gardens which led him directly to a &s;mall hall where &s;ervants al|ways waited. But in going towards this hall&punc;
<PB N="39" REF="036127_0251_10085130210FFD40">
he nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;&s;ed before the breakfa&s;t-room windows, which opened to the ground, and at which at that moment Lady Almeria was &s;tand|ing. They &s;aw each other: and Lady Almeria beckoning to him, &s;aid, 'So you are come? I thought you could not &s;tay away: but you have good information: for I &s;uppo&s;e you know Sir William is not at home?'</P>
<P>'Sir William not at home?' repeated Henry, 'Why did you not tell me &s;o before?'</P>
<P>'Oh, he went away two days ago, upon &s;ome &s;udden bu&s;ine&s;s or other, that &s;ignified not a far|thing, and will &s;tay away a week I believe. Well, &s;it down, and I'll run and tell Ellen. I am &s;ure the &s;ight of you will do her good.'</P>
<P>'Stay, I beg you will &s;tay,' &s;aid he. 'Do you &s;uppo&s;e, knowing all you do, that I would &s;ee Lady Ackland in the ab&s;ence of Sir William?'</P>
<P>'Why not? I tell you it will do her good: and it was an hundred to one but you had found her in this room. She is much better than &s;he was, and comes down to breakfa&s;t: but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he had a head-ach this morning; and &s;o kept her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ber.'</P>
<P>'I am happy &s;he did &s;o. And now, Lady Al|meria, if it be po&s;&s;ible for you to keep a &s;ecret, promi&s;e me that you will not mention to Lady Ackland that I have been here. As &s;ome little indemnification for &s;uch re&s;traint, I give you leave to tell Sir William every circum&s;tance of my vi&s;it.'</P>

<P>'If half what you have told me is authentic, I think you may an&s;wer that que&s;tion your&s;elf.

<P>'But why not give your&s;elf the merit of your mighty forbearance with Ellen?&mdash;Objection to &s;eeing Lady Ackland indeed! I know you would give one of your eyes to &s;ee her with the other. Why not tell her what hard&s;hips you impo&s;e upon your&s;elf for her &s;ake?'</P>
<P>'Dear Lady Almeria, would you have me &s;hew to Lady Ackland, that I know Sir William is jealous? I hope in God this is a truth &s;he will always remain ignorant of.

<P>Henry darted out of the room; and to avoid the path that would have detained him for &s;ome time within &s;ight of the windows, turned ha&s;tily into a more private one, which led into a part of the plea&s;ure ground, that did not connect with that part of the park by which he had entered. After wandering about &s;ome little time, he found his way over a fence, from which he regained the public road, and from thence his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When here, he reflected upon the e&s;cape he had, and upon the injury he might have cau&s;ed Ellen, had he &s;een her in Sir William's ab&s;ence. Such a circum&s;tance would, he well knew, have car|ried to a jealous mind, conviction of a private corre&s;pondence. He determined to learn for|bearance for the future, and from henceforth to act as if the &s;orrows and injuries of Ellen were indifferent to him. The evil that might have attended the gratification of his &s;olicitude upon this &s;ubject, though he had guarded, as he thought, the ma&s;k of it with every po&s;&s;ible cau|tion, fixed the pang of &s;elf reproach in his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="036127_0254_10085139E3BFEE88">'Deare&s;t Ellen,' &s;aid he to him&s;elf, 'I am forbidden to contribute to your happine&s;s: but let no alleviation to my own mi&s;ery, tempt me again to hazard an increa&s;e of yours.'</P>
<P>Alas! if the po&s;&s;ibility of increa&s;ing the &s;or|rows of Ellen appeared thus in&s;upportable to the feeling and generous heart of Henry, what would have been his angui&s;h had he been con|&s;cious of the evils he had already prepared for her.

<P>Lady Almeria had a &s;harp conte&s;t between her love of communication, and her pride, which was &s;omewhat piqued by Henry's words, 'If it be po&s;&s;ible you can keep a &s;ecret.'

<P>LADY ALMERIA returning to the hou&s;e, learnt from Ellen the unexpected return of Sir William; and &s;he learnt it with much &s;atisfac|tion; for being heartily tired with her re&s;idence at Oakley, &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;eize the moment when Ellen had a companion to leave it. She therefore replied, 'Well, then, you'll want me no longer: and therefore I will return to town to-morrow, where, I flatter my&s;elf, many people want me.'</P>
<P>'You will leave me,' &s;aid Ellen, with a deep &s;igh, 'you will leave me your little girl?'</P>
<P>'Mo&s;t willingly. But I hope you won't think of &s;taying here: you'll never recover your &s;pirits if you do. But if Almeria grows inconvenient to you, either &s;end her to me in town, or let her maid take her down into Devon&s;hire.'</P>
<P>Lady Almeria then went to give &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irec|tions to her &s;ervants, for her removal the next day: and Ellen, di&s;pirited and occupied wholly with conjectures as to the cau&s;e of Sir William's di&s;compo&s;ure, retired to her own room.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria returned &s;ometime afterwards to the breakfa&s;t parlour&punc; and it occurring to her, that it would be a good thing to apprize Henry
<PB N="46" REF="036127_0258_10085144F1CBDD20">
of the arrival of Sir William, &s;he wrote him the following lines.</P>
<P>'Sir William returned this morning. You made your e&s;cape in the nick of time. The ene|my would have been upon you in a moment. Now, however, you may make your approaches in all due form, and with a decorum that will &s;et &s;u&s;picion at defiance. I &s;hall be gone to-morrow; &s;o to all your other motives, you may add that of charity, for your vi&s;its here. Per|haps the world will be kind enough to impute them wholly to that laudable principle. However, pray come; for poor Ellen will be moped to death, if left wholly to the conver&s;ation of <HI>caro &s;po&s;o.</HI>'</P>
<P>This note &s;he left open upon the table, while &s;he ran up &s;tairs to countermand &s;ome directions &s;he had given to her maid. She was not ab&s;ent ten minutes: but Sir William entering the room in her ab&s;ence, his eye was involuntary caught by his own name, written in Lady Almeria's hand. No motive of honor, or delicacy, could at that moment have re&s;trained him from the gratification of his curio&s;ity. He read&mdash;every word was a dagger to his heart. He ru&s;hed out of the room into the garden, with the fury of a mad man, impelled by a &s;udden impul&s;e, to &s;eek Henry, and make him atone by his blood for the injury he could no longer doubt he had received from him.</P>
<P>A few moments, however, brought him to calm|er reflection. His re&s;olution was previou&s;ly taken, and taken upon what he thought a certainty lit|tle &s;hort of that which he had this moment recei|ved. But &s;uch evidence as this brought convic|tion

with it: and he felt &s;omewhat like &s;atisfaction, that, acting upon &s;ure grounds, that would now be ju&s;tice, which might before have been cruelty. His victim, if a victim he made, he had always determined &s;hould be Ellen. Her criminality was, in his eyes, of a much deeper dye than Henry's. It was the complicated product of hypocricy, infidelity, and treachery. He con&s;i|dered each action of her life, &s;ince he became her hu&s;band, as marked with the mo&s;t vicious duplicity: and he held him&s;elf acquitted to his own heart, for u&s;ing the &s;ame means for the puni&s;hment of vice, which, he believed, had been pur&s;ued in the perpetration of it.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent tumult of his mind, however, was too great to e&s;cape notice, if he were to &s;ubject him&s;elf to ob&s;ervation. He returned, therefore, to the hou&s;e; and &s;ummoning his &s;ervant, complained of &s;udden indi&s;po&s;ition, and went to bed.</P>
<P>Ellen was &s;oon informed, that Sir William was not well, and going to his chamber, &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his inflamed eye, and felt his burning hand, with a truly tender compa&s;&s;ion: &s;he entreated h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;end in&s;tantly for a phy&s;ician, and &s;eating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by his bed-&s;ide, declared her intention of wate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ing by him, 'till the phy&s;ician arrived. Sir Wil|liam oppo&s;ed this re&s;olution &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly, and with &s;omewhat of &s;uch unkind warmth, that Ellen, fearing to be of more di&s;&s;ervice by oppo|&s;ition, than of u&s;e by her attendance, at length yielded: and &s;he yielded the more willingly, as Sir William po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, that his illne&s;s only aro&s;e from having rode fa&s;t in a ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and he averred that a few hours &s;leep (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e

affected to feel him&s;elf drow&s;y) would entirely remove all his complaints.</P>
<P>Ellen was not, however, &s;o well &s;atisfied with Sir William's medical &s;kill, as to rely wholly ei|ther upon his account of the cau&s;e of his illne&s;s, or in his confidence in its cure. She therefore &s;ent for a phy&s;ician; and frequently vi&s;ited the door of Sir William's apartment, to &s;atisfy her|&s;elf, if &s;he could, whether he &s;lept or not. She was &s;oon convinced that he did not &s;leep, being &s;ure that &s;he heard him up, and walking about his room. She gently tryed the lock of the door, but finding it fa&s;tened, did not venture to pu&s;h her intru&s;ion farther.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance fixed the mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;o|licitude on her mind. The humour in which Sir William had appeared, on his return home, and which, when he complained of illne&s;s, &s;he had per&s;uaded her&s;elf to attribute wholly to that cau&s;e, &s;he now began to con&s;ider more as a cau&s;e it&s;elf&punc; and to fear, that if there really were any indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;ition, it was brought on by di&s;compo&s;ure of mind. But &s;he apprehended that illne&s;s was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> pretence, and that Sir William meant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> withdraw him&s;elf from all ob&s;ervation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> exciting any curio&s;ity by doing &s;o. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ca&s;e, no good could be produced by her forcing her&s;elf upon him again&s;t his will. If he were really ill &s;he could not doubt, but that he would do all that was nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a ca&s;e: and if any thing had ari&s;en to vex him, &s;he thought her influence to calm his mind, would be exerted with the mo&s;t hope of &s;uce&s;s, when he appeared more willing to li&s;ten to her. She therefore retired to her own room; and there
<PB N="49" REF="036127_0261_1008514ECABD3CB0">
waited in anxious &s;u&s;pence, 'till Sir William's bell &s;hould give her a pretence again to appear in his apartment.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were pa&s;&s;ing, Lady Alme|ria had returned to the breakfa&s;t-room, had &s;ealed her note, and di&s;patched it to the Lodge, by the &s;ervant whom &s;he was &s;ending to the neighbouring town, for po&s;t hor&s;es for her car|riage the next day. When &s;he was told Sir William was ill, &s;he was &s;omewhat alarmed, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be again involved in the cares of charity, and that his illne&s;s &s;hould be of &s;uch a nature as would not allow her, with decency, to leave Ellen while it continued. She went to Lady Ackland's appartment, to make all the enquiries po&s;&s;ible; but could learn nothing more that was &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the phy&s;ician arrived: and Ellen de&s;ired he might be &s;hewn immediately to Sir William. The &s;ervant, however, informed her that he had received the mo&s;t po&s;itive com|mands from his ma&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, not to enter his room until called for, and that he dur&s;t not di&s;obey.</P>
<P>As Ellen's fears on the account of illne&s;s had very much &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he yielded to the &s;ervant's remon&s;trance; and affected to &s;uppo&s;e that Sir William &s;lept, and that &s;leep would be his cer|tain cure. In her &s;tolen vi&s;its to the door, &s;he had ob&s;erved all was quiet; and began to hope that the paroxy&s;m of ill humour, which &s;he was induced to think was the whole of the ca&s;e, was going off.</P>
<P>About eight in the evening, Sir William rang his bell. His &s;ervant found him up: and on being told that Doctor Wil&s;on was in the hou&s;e,
<PB N="50" REF="036127_0262_10085151B83BCC38">
he readily admitted both him and Ellen. With a kind of bitter raillery, he treated her wife-like fears, that had induced her to trouble Doctor Wil&s;on to ride ten miles in a hot day, to vi&s;it a man who had gone to bed to &s;leep off a head-ach; and &s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ching out his hand to the phy&s;ician, 'Feel, Sir,' &s;aid he, 'if that pul&s;e does not beat health|fully.'</P>
<P>Doctor Wil&s;on affirmed it did; and a&s;&s;ured Ellen &s;he need have no farther apprehen&s;ion, for that Sir William had known how to cure him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ellen, convinced that her &s;u&s;picions as to the non-exi&s;tence of any complaint, were perfectly well founded, now withdrew; and informed Lady A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">meria, that Sir William had &s;lept off all his c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mplaints, and that Doctor Wil&s;on &s;aid he was quite well.</P>
<P>'Thank God!' &s;aid Lady Almeria.</P>
<P>Ellen could not help &s;miling. 'I am &s;ure Sir William is much obliged to you for the in|tere&s;t you take in his health!' &s;aid &s;he</P>
<P>'Pi&s;h!&mdash;no. That's not quite the thing. But you know I have fixed to go to town to-morrow: and I could not have gone, and left Sir William ill, and you &s;o drooping.'</P>
<P>Then &s;hook her head; and moralized a little to her&s;elf, on the good and ill that attended a di&s;po&s;ition &s;o thoroughly &s;elfi&s;h.</P>
<P>Sir William appeared both at &s;upper and at breakfa&s;t next morning: but it happened that he was never an in&s;tant with Lady Almeria apart from Ellen: and if he had been &s;o, it is probable &s;he would not have mentioned the vi&s;it Henry had made, both from the rea&s;on &s;he had given, of never willingly contributing to the
<PB N="51" REF="036127_0263_100851538A802028">
&s;atisfaction of Sir William, and the feeling no particular &s;timulus to relate that which had no|thing out of the common way to recommend it, and which contained no mi&s;chief in it.</P>
<P>When &s;he &s;hook hands at parting with Ellen, 'Pray endeavour to recover your &s;pirits,' &s;aid &s;he. 'But you ought to go &s;ome where. You'll never be your&s;elf again if you &s;tay here.'</P>
<P>'I think,' &s;aid Sir William, after Lady Al|meria was gone, 'I think for <HI>once</HI> Lady Almeria gives good advice. I have been thinking of the &s;ame thing. What &s;ay you to an expedition for &s;ome little time?'</P>
<P>'I will accompany you any where willingly,' &s;aid Ellen, her heart beating with the hope that Groby Manor would be the place thought of.</P>
<P>'Your health, your &s;pirits, require &s;ome change of &s;cene,' returned Sir William. 'Our new-born happine&s;s (hurryingly, and with a cloud|ed brow he &s;poke it) requires nurture. In a di&s;tant re&s;idence, in a foreign country, I hope we &s;hould be able to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the one and &s;ecure the other. What &s;ay you to going abroad for a few months?'</P>
<P>The thought of Northumberland cro&s;&s;ed El|len's mind; and prevented that promptne&s;s of compliance with which &s;he u&s;ually met any pro|po&s;al from Sir William.

<P>'When,' &s;aid Sir William peevi&s;hly, '&s;hall I propo&s;e any thing, to which you will give a rea|dy a&s;&s;ent?'</P>
<P>'You cannot wonder,' returned Ellen mildly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat I do not willingly con&s;ent to add another twelvemonth to the &s;eparation which has already taken place between me and &s;ome of tho&s;e whom I be&s;t love, and who be&s;t love me.

<P>Sir William then left her, and with an air as if he would immediately begin his preparations: and Ellen retired to her room with a mind ex|tremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and embarra&s;&s;ed by the con&s;i|deration of all that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the preceding morning.

<P>From the habit, which had ari&s;en from princi|ple, that Ellen had acquired, of always looking on the bright &s;ide of events, and of opening her mind to all the good it was po&s;&s;ible they could produce, &s;he was enabled at this moment to &s;ub|due a crowd of painful apprehen&s;ions, and indi&s;|tinct fears, that aro&s;e in her thoughts.

<P>It was this thought that had made her &s;o readily yield her con&s;ent, and her rea&s;onable de&s;ire of &s;eeing her family before her departure, to the needle&s;s hurry, as it appeared to her, and

capricious wi&s;hes of Sir William: and it was this thought, that in&s;pired her with fortitude to conceal the bitter regret that &s;he felt in con&s;e|quence of this &s;acrifice. She was re&s;olved that Sir William &s;hould &s;ee on her part nothing but good humour and alacrity: and &s;he hoped that in the cheerfulne&s;s with which &s;he quitted every other attachment to accompany him, he would find a full refutation to tho&s;e unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions that had hitherto de&s;troyed her peace, together with his own.</P>

<P>THERE is no virtue which &s;o immediately produces its own reward, as a vigorous exer|tion of the mind, ari&s;ing from a purity of prin|ciple.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;oon felt that cheerfulne&s;s and that alacrity which &s;he had judged it proper to a&s;|&s;ume. She wrote without delay to her father, informing him of the journey &s;he was about to undertake. But &s;oftening the apparent har&s;h|ne&s;s of their declining to vi&s;it Northumberland before the &s;et out, by repre&s;enting that Sir Wil|liam's ha&s;te to be abroad aro&s;e from his &s;olici|tude on her account, which would not &s;uffer him to li&s;ten to any delay: &s;he intimated a very probable hope, that her ab&s;ence would be much &s;horter than was at pre&s;ent talked of. She &s;ug|ge&s;ted that it would depend upon her perfect
<PB N="58" REF="036127_0270_1008516AD9828098">
re&s;toration to health: and as &s;he could truly &s;ay, that all remains of indi&s;po&s;ition were even now trifling, &s;he dwelt upon the &s;trong probability, that they mu&s;t meet again early in the &s;pring. She endeavoured, by an appearance of cheerful|ne&s;s and &s;atisfaction, to leave no doubt upon the mind of her father, that the journey met fully with her concurrence: and &s;he promi&s;ed the mo&s;t con&s;tant and minute details of all &s;he &s;hould &s;ee or hear.</P>
<P>The letter, however kindly de&s;igned, or artfully framed, by no means an&s;wered the purpo&s;e for which it was written. Mr. Mordaunt was &s;truck with the glaring incon&s;i&s;tency of the degree of indi&s;po&s;ition, that required &s;o precipitate a remo|val into another country, and the choice that had been made of the country to which the inva|lid was to be removed. The climate of the northern part of Germany &s;eemed ill calculated for the recovery of a con&s;titution debilitated by &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Ellen had indeed mentioned, as a concurring motive for her journey, that from change of &s;cene was hoped a relief to her &s;pirits, as well as from a change of climate to her health. But Mr. Mordaunt well knew, that, if left to her own choice, Ellen would have &s;ought every relief that &s;he could hope for her mind in Northumberland, rather than el&s;ewhere: and the cheerfulne&s;s which &s;he had a&s;&s;umed in her manner of writing, with the plea&s;ure &s;he affected to take in the pro&s;pects before her, &s;eemed to &s;ay, that &s;he did not &s;tand in need of much a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this way.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections perplexed and di&s;turbed Mr. Mordaunt&punc; and he re&s;olved to &s;ee Ellen before
<PB N="59" REF="036127_0271_1008516C8AC96210">
her departure. He wrote accordingly to inform her of his intention: but that he might not delay for a moment a journey upon which Ellen had de&s;cribed Sir William as &s;o earne&s;tly bent, he told her, that he &s;hould immediately proceed to town, where he hoped he &s;hould be time enough to catch them for a few hours as they pa&s;&s;ed through it; he having under&s;tood from Ellen that Sir William did not mean to make even a day's &s;tay in the metropolis. But Sir William's ha&s;te defeated Mr. Mordaunt's kind purpo&s;e: and though, had he known the fears and &s;u&s;pi|cions that had found their way into Mr. Mor|daunt's mind, he would willingly have &s;pared not one day only, but &s;everal days for the purpo&s;e of removing them; yet it not having occurred to him that Mr. Mordaunt would not re&s;t &s;atis|fied with Ellen's repre&s;entation of the matter, he was not aware that there were either fears or &s;u&s;picions to remove.</P>
<P>On the very day that Ellen's letter arrived at Groby Manor, &s;he and Sir William left Oakley for London. Contrary to the fir&s;t plan, they pa&s;&s;ed two nights and a day there: but pur&s;uing their journey the day following with diligne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, they had &s;ailed from Harwich before Mr. Mor|daunt reached town.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance that had detained Ellen a whole day in town, was the &s;udden marriage of her own maid. Jenny had been courted by a young man, &s;on to one of Sir William's prin|cipal tenants. It had been agreed that the match was not to take place until the young man could take a farm of his own: and this they had con|&s;idered as &s;omewhat a di&s;tant pro&s;pect. But the
<PB N="60" REF="036127_0272_1008516F48CF6AB8">
day after Sir William had determined upon the plan of going abroad, his &s;teward had offered a farm to Thomas upon &s;uch advantageous terms, that nothing was wanting but the con&s;ent of Jenny to become his wife, to make him one of the mo&s;t contented of men. Jenny objected to the impo&s;&s;ibility of leaving her Lady &s;o &s;uddenly, and &s;o much to her inconvenience. But her &s;cru|ples were &s;oon overcome by the rhetoric of Thomas: and &s;he mentioned, though with &s;ome reluctance, to Ellen, how unlucky it was, that &s;he was obliged ju&s;t then to go into foreign parts, when if &s;he were to &s;tay at home, &s;he might have been married to Thomas.</P>
<P>Ellen ea&s;ily under&s;tood her: and as no per|&s;onal inconvenience ever cau&s;ed her to he&s;itate, when the happine&s;s of others depended upon her deci&s;ion, &s;he cheered Jenny with a ready and kind con&s;ent to her remaining in England, and by a&s;&s;uring her, that &s;he did not apprehend any unplea&s;antne&s;s to her&s;elf in con&s;equence of her doing &s;o.</P>
<P>Sir William &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with Ellen's di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s on this occa&s;ion; and gratified both the mi&s;tre&s;s and the maid, by making Jenny a very hand&s;ome nuptial pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Ellen received this act of Sir William as a farther proof, that his manner of thinking was becoming more congenial to her own. Of &s;er|vants he generally &s;poke as of creatures of a lower order of beings, who were bound, if well paid, to con&s;ider them&s;elves, without murmuring, as the &s;laves of caprice and the victims of tyran|ny. She had feared he would have inveighed at the ingratitude and unfeelingne&s;s of Jenny:
<PB N="61" REF="036127_0273_100851720A523A28">
and &s;he had prepared &s;everal mollifying argu|ments, to make him &s;ubmit quietly to the incon|venience her &s;udden de&s;ertion mu&s;t occa&s;ion. She was much delighted to find him in &s;o differ|ent a di&s;po&s;ition; and readily acceded to his reque&s;t, that, as &s;he had now no Engli&s;h &s;ervant, to who&s;e &s;ervices &s;he had been accu&s;tomed, &s;he would &s;upply Jenny's place with a foreign one, which, he a&s;&s;ured her, &s;he would find much more convenient during her &s;ojourn abroad.</P>
<P>Ellen had written to Lady Almeria to de&s;ire &s;he would find her &s;ome per&s;on who could &s;upply the pre&s;ent emergency: and the choice &s;he had been obliged to make between &s;everal candidates had detained her in town. Having fixed upon the lea&s;t exceptionable, &s;he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Jenny; and with her new attendant had proceeded on her journey.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed Mr. Mordaunt's di&s;ap|pointment, when, on his arrival in town, he found Ellen had left it. But he had &s;uch comfortable a&s;&s;urances both from Lady Almeria and his &s;on, of the &s;tate of her health, and the ea&s;e and ap|parent contentment of her mind, that he became perfectly &s;atisfied in every re&s;pect, but that of having mi&s;&s;ed the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing her. He imputed the unnece&s;&s;ary hurry which had accom|panied their departure wholly to the &s;olicitude of Sir William, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the health of Ellen, a little aided by the plea&s;ure that it was rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e he would feel in returning to the &s;cenes and habits of foreign courts: as it was very apparent that tho&s;e of his native country, were not nearly &s;o plea&s;ing to him.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="036127_0274_1008517393012490">Mr. Mordaunt returned to Northumberland, well enabled by the &s;atisfaction his own mind had received, to tranquillize the anxious appre|hen&s;ions of Ellen's friends and well wi&s;hers, who were, indeed, as numerous as her acquaintance, with only the exception perhaps of her own mother.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mordaunt, however, had long cea&s;ed to feel that rancour of di&s;like, which for many years had occa&s;ioned &s;o much mi&s;ery to Ellen. Her marriage had removed her from the &s;ituation where her &s;uperior qualities had given Mrs. Mor|daunt perpetual umbrage: and the power that this marriage had given Ellen, of gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fying many of her mother's wi&s;hes, had in &s;ome degree con|ciliat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d her affections&mdash;affections which never yielded but to the voice of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en had taken care to &s;upply her con&s;tantly with &s;ome new fa&s;hionable article of dre&s;s or furniture. She had written her every fa&s;hionable anecdote &s;he could collect; and had furni&s;hed her with every new play, or political pamphlet, which made the conver&s;ation of the day; and which, from being early communicated to Mrs. Mordaunt, enabled her to &s;upport that &s;uperiority over her country neighbours, in which all the de&s;ires of her &s;till exi&s;ting vanity &s;eemed now to cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Mortification, too, had humbled her: and though it had not corrected the faults of her temper, it had made her more careful to conceal them. The con&s;tant &s;ight of her elde&s;t and favourite daughter, who, with her two children, drew their &s;canty &s;upport, and to the inconvenience of the family, wholly from Mr. Mordaunt, was &s;uch an undeniable proof of the fatal con&s;equences of

her misjudging pride and vanity, as compelled her to appear to adjure the principle that had led to &s;uch fatal mi&s;takes. She no longer dared to expre&s;s a de&s;ire to rule in a family, every in|dividual of which &s;uffered, in one way or other, from her once unbounded &s;way. A never inter|miting di&s;content preyed upon her heart, and undermined her con&s;titution. The marriage of her &s;on with Lady Almeria, from which &s;he had hoped to have derived &s;o much &s;atisfaction and con&s;equence, yielded her neither one nor the other.</P>
<P>Lady Almeria &s;hewed her the mo&s;t pointed di&s;re&s;pect; never conde&s;cended to vi&s;it her; or invited her daughter to partake with her in the amu&s;ements of her country hou&s;e, or the gaieties of a London life. The unwi&s;e and unju&s;tifiable partiality &s;he had manife&s;ted towards her &s;on, he repaid, rather as if he con&s;idered the effect than the motive. No con&s;ideration for her maternal tenderne&s;s &s;oftened with him the cen&s;ure which her character &s;o well ju&s;tified, and he by turns ridiculed and di&s;regarded her.</P>
<P>From Mr. Mordaunt however &s;he continued to receive every mark of con&s;ideration and kind|ne&s;s, and as her increa&s;ing ill health &s;oftened his heart towards her more and more, all pa&s;t offences were by degrees forgotten by him, and &s;omething like his fir&s;t love began to revive in his heart.</P>
<P>From the contemplation of a character &s;o &s;el|fi&s;h as Mrs. Mordaunt's, it is relief to turn the mind to that of Henry's.</P>
<P>Stunned as he was at the fir&s;t intelligence of Ellen's journey to the continent, and by the

certainty that &s;he was thus removed from his &s;ight and ob&s;ervation, yet when he learnt from Lady Almeria her improved health, and appa|rently recovered ea&s;e of mind, he found ample compen&s;ation for every &s;elfi&s;h pang, in the hope that &s;he was now about to reap the reward of a virtue and &s;trength of mind which had proved it&s;elf &s;uperior to all the buffetings and cro&s;&s;es of fortune. In the progre&s;s, and event, as he hoped it would prove, of her trials, he acknowledged the force of that principle of the mind, which makes the inviolable pre&s;ervation of a once vowed duty the rule for conduct, and the &s;tandard of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Ellen will pur&s;ue, thought he, her path of rectitude in foreign climes, far, far di&s;tant it is true from me: but if I am enabled to tread the line marked out for me, with an equally &s;teady foot, then, in &s;pite of pre&s;ent di&s;tance, and pro|bably future &s;eparation, we &s;hall meet at la&s;t&mdash; meet where no decorum, no unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions, no unworthy fear, will re&s;train the plea&s;ures of our intercour&s;e.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE with the&s;e kind thoughts and flatter|ing hopes the Engli&s;h friends of Ellen endea|voured to con&s;ole them&s;elves for her ab&s;ence, &s;he was pur&s;uing her route abroad with much le&s;s &s;atisfaction than &s;he had promi&s;ed her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The ha&s;te with which &s;he had quitted England, had occa&s;ioned every hour from the moment when the &s;cheme was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to that in which I had taken place, to be wholly occupied with preparations for the journey: and &s;he had had little lei&s;ure or opportunity to attend to the occupations of Sir William, who was equally engaged with her&s;elf. In the little communica|tion &s;he had with him on any &s;ubject apart from the one that &s;o mutually employed their thoughts, &s;he had had rea&s;on to believe him &s;atisfied with her; and though his &s;atisfaction was not accom|panied by the gaiety that it u&s;ed to be, before any unkindne&s;s had ari&s;en between them, yet it appeared of that genuine kind, which promi&s;ed continuance and increa&s;e.</P>
<P>Ellen, however, &s;oon began to fear, that her willingne&s;s to believe the be&s;t, had deceived her.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="036127_0278_100851819C8A3E70">A profound gravity, almo&s;t a gloom, &s;eemed to have pervaded the mind of Sir William. He treated her with an au&s;tere coldne&s;s, totally dif|ferent from any thing &s;he had hitherto &s;een in him: and as the bur&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion and &s;allies of ill humour &s;he had before been expo&s;ed to, ap|peared the re&s;ult of &s;udden and irre&s;i&s;tible &s;u&s;pi|cion, and had therefore &s;ub&s;ided as the &s;u&s;picion vani&s;hed; the arbitrary &s;everity that he now a&s;&s;umed towards her, &s;eemed as if it could only be ju&s;tified by a conviction of her depravity. It was the lordly tone of a de&s;potic hu&s;band, which he now took upon him: and he extended his privileges to the regulating the mo&s;t trifling arti|cles of her economy. Her own &s;ervant appeared to be particularly the object of his caprice: re|peatedly Ellen was obliged to change her atten|dant: and every &s;ucceeding one &s;eemed but &s;till more the object of Sir William's di&s;like.</P>
<P>Ellen's corre&s;pondence with her Engli&s;h friends was more than every thing el&s;e a cau&s;e of offence to Sir William. He reproached her continually, that though in per&s;on &s;he had accompanied him abroad, her thoughts, her wi&s;hes, and her affec|tions, were in England. He &s;eemed to regard every packet &s;he received with &s;u&s;picion; and &s;ometimes &s;crupled not to hint, that they &s;hould never be happy together until &s;he broke off all intercour&s;e with every one but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ellen turned a deaf ear to all &s;uch in&s;inuati|ons. Nothing, &s;he was re&s;olved, &s;hould induce her to make &s;uch a &s;acrifice of her duty, nor any thing but force compel her to it. 'All the affections in a good heart, would &s;he &s;ome|times &s;ay, are &s;o clo&s;ely entwined, that the

one cannot be de&s;troyed without the de&s;truc|tion of the others. If I did not love my pa|rents, my &s;i&s;ters, and my friends, I could not love you.'</P>
<P>Sir William under&s;tood nothing of this: and as he had given up the hope of being beloved by Ellen, his pre&s;ent unkindne&s;s was rather the re&s;ult of ill humour, than the effect of jealou&s;y. Of the guilt of Ellen he had no doubt. The readine&s;s with which &s;he had concurred in his &s;cheme for leaving England, the cheerfulne&s;s and good humour which had accompanied this con|currence, he con&s;idered all as parts of that ma&s;s of intended hypocri&s;y, which he believed, had pervaded her whole conduct, from the fir&s;t hour of their marriage&mdash;an hypocri&s;y that &s;welled her guilt, in his apprehen&s;ion, beyond all bounds, and excited in his brea&s;t a proportionate re&s;ent|ment: he had been willing to appear duped by it, while it could any ways further his own pur|po&s;es: but he was determined to puni&s;h it by every act of unkindne&s;s and provocation, which an irritated and revengeful mind could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>In a more generous and candid di&s;po&s;ition than Sir William's, the conciliating and affection|ate manners of Ellen, with the ingenuous frank|ne&s;s of her &s;entiments, mu&s;t have produced different effects. They mu&s;t have induced a doubt of the &s;tronge&s;t appearances that indicated guilt in her: they mu&s;t have led to explanation and acquittal: or at lea&s;t they mu&s;t have &s;u&s;|pended condemnation, and withheld the arm of cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>But Sir William's re&s;olution was taken. Noth|ing could now divert him from his purpo&s;e. It
<PB N="68" REF="036127_0280_10085187B7C920C0">
is true, had he been entirely ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, he would, until the moment of putting it into execution, have concealed all de&s;ire of vengeance. But the ill pa&s;&s;ions rankling in his heart broke out in &s;pite of every effort to the contrary, into paroxy&s;ms of tyranny and ill humour: and poor Ellen was the victim of them all.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances it is not to be won|dered at, if Ellen placed her mo&s;t fervent wi&s;hes on a return to England, or that &s;he found little real &s;atisfaction from the varying objects that occurred. But &s;till Ellen's di&s;po&s;ition and prin|ciple of making the be&s;t of every thing, did not for&s;ake her. Her perfect good &s;en&s;e directed her to the be&s;t means for attaining this end. It taught her to keep her own pa&s;&s;ions under con|trol. It repre&s;&s;ed the tyranny of imagination. It enabled her to balance the real good and evil of her &s;ituation: and it &s;hewed her, that, in the &s;cale of human mi&s;eries, there were more above than below her. The circum&s;tances of every day &s;eemed, however, to change this proportion.</P>
<P>The pre&s;&s;ure of Sir William's ill humour be|came &s;o perpetual, that Ellen, with all her patience and ingenuity, could &s;carcely contrive to e&s;cape one moment its weight. She hardly knew how to extract one drop of comfort from any reflec|tion that her pre&s;ent &s;ituation or future pro&s;pects afforded.</P>
<P>She had nearly lo&s;t all hope, that any conduct of hers could meliorate the di&s;po&s;ition of Sir William: and &s;he was farther confirmed in this hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s, by con&s;idering, that his pre&s;ent un|kindne&s;s could not be the fruit of any &s;u&s;picion ari&s;ing from the events of the pa&s;&s;ing hour. She
<PB N="69" REF="036127_0281_1008518944CAFD60">
was &s;eparated from all who were dear to her. She was alone with Sir William in a world where there did not exi&s;t an individual who en|gaged her attention, or intere&s;ted her affections. What, then, could he &s;u&s;pect? what, then, could he fear? It was not po&s;&s;ible, that the events of the pre&s;ent time &s;hould excite either fears or &s;u&s;picions. This ill treatment, therefore, &s;he could only impute to a deep re&s;entment for for|mer imagined offences, to e&s;tranged affections, and to natural temper, evils hopele&s;s of cure.</P>
<P>Mild rea&s;onings, cheerful tenderne&s;s, affection|ate attention, and hitherto unwearied patience, &s;he had tried in vain. She knew of no other remedies: and, re&s;igning hope, &s;he endeavoured to arm her&s;elf with a double &s;tock of fortitude, and thus &s;trove to &s;upport, with calmne&s;s and dignity, the mi&s;eries of a de&s;tiny &s;he knew not how to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>She could hope little from time, except as the di&s;&s;olver of that union which, as long as it la&s;ted, &s;he was now convinced, mu&s;t be a &s;ource of unallayed affliction to her. But it was not in Ellen's nature, even in wi&s;h, to e&s;tabli&s;h her happine&s;s on the death of a fellow creature, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in her cha&s;tened and religious mind, to de&s;ire to accelerate to her&s;elf &s;o awful a period. She was de&s;irous in this, as in every other particular, to refer her&s;elf, wholly and without re&s;erve, to the di&s;po&s;al of a being, on who&s;e wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s &s;he had the mo&s;t profound and un&s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en reliance. She left events to his care, who, in &s;uperintending an univer&s;e, withdraws not his attention for an in&s;tant from the &s;malle&s;t atom of which it is compo&s;ed; and bent her &s;olicitude&punc;

undivided, to the right conduct of that part allot|ted to her and on the performance of which depended a happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, as unlimited in degree as duration.</P>
<P>Ellen judging it expedient to avoid, if po&s;&s;ible, all <HI>&s;elf commi&s;eration,</HI> allowed her&s;elf little lei&s;ure for reflection upon her chagrins. She contrived to be almo&s;t wholly occupied by the variety of per|&s;ons and things which their continual journeyings threw in her way: and as her general knowledge and the cultivation of her mind, fitted her to enjoy the be&s;t conver&s;ation, and &s;upplied her with ob&s;ervations and reflections upon every &s;ub|ject of curio&s;ity that occurred, either in nature or art, however &s;he might be deprived of happi|ne&s;s, &s;he was by no means de&s;titute of a very intere&s;ting amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>She never yielded to the &s;upinene&s;s and lan|gour, which, from the hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of her &s;orrow, would &s;ometimes invade her mind. She con&s;i|dered it as a &s;ignal to rekindle her activity, and to double her efforts towards procuring occupation.</P>
<P>They moved from place to place, according to the will and caprice of Sir William: and hav|ing con&s;umed &s;ome months in vi&s;iting &s;everal of the Northern Courts of Germany, on the &s;hores of the Baltic, and in a &s;hort re&s;idence at Berlin, they found them&s;elves, towards the end of De|cember, &s;ettled in a plea&s;ant hou&s;e, on the banks of the Elb&egrave;.</P>
<P>Ellen was, on her fir&s;t arrival at Dre&s;den, in|troduced to Sir William's &s;i&s;ter. She found her perfectly well bred, and highly accompli&s;hed, a&s;&s;idious to render her all the little offices and attentions that politene&s;s required, but apparently
<PB N="71" REF="036127_0283_1008518DE3AD83B0">
without a wi&s;h to cultivate any intimacy with her, beyond what common civility demanded. There &s;eemed to be little attraction between their characters. Madam Te&s;chen had been &s;o long ab&s;ent from her country, that England had no place in her affections. Her &s;entiments and her inclinations were German: and the evident di&s;re|gard and coldne&s;s with which Sir William treated Ellen, mu&s;t unavoidably give her an unfavour|able idea of her character, which it could not be expected, in the kind of intercour&s;e that took place between them, Ellen would be able to de&s;troy.</P>

<P>ELLEN, indeed, &s;oon found that neither with Madam Te&s;chen nor any one el&s;e was it Sir William's wi&s;h that &s;he &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate. He &s;eemed unwilling that &s;he &s;hould be known, or that &s;he &s;hould have it in her power to make her&s;elf friends.</P>
<P>After &s;he had been introduced at court, and into all &s;uch hou&s;es as Sir William had been for|merly acquainted with, and after &s;he had &s;een all that the place afforded, worthy of curio&s;ity, Sir William made it appear very evidently, that he was never &s;o well plea&s;ed with her, as when &s;he remained &s;hut up in her own habitation.</P>
<P>This de&s;ire of Sir William's to &s;eclude her from all &s;ociety, agreed much better with her inclination than her prudence. Sir William was &s;eldom at home: and thus left to her&s;elf, and deprived of the means of indulging the active propen&s;ities of her mind, or the benevolent di&s;|po&s;itions of her heart, &s;he found no intere&s;t in the common occupation which her books or her work afforded, &s;ufficiently powerful at all times to &s;u&s;pend the querulou&s;ne&s;s of regret, or the anticipation of fear.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="036127_0285_100851963829FDA0">It became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to find &s;ome employment, which, from its novelty, might en|gage her whole attention. In this dilemma, the advantage which would accrue from learn|ing the German tongue, occurred to her. Hi|therto &s;he had never continued long enough in any one place to attempt it: but &s;he had now more than &s;ufficient lei&s;ure. It had been repre|&s;ented to her as extremely difficult: but this was rather an inducement to her to attempt to learn it at this time, than any di&s;couragement. What|ever would call for the greate&s;t exertion of her faculties, and demand the large&s;t &s;hare of her attention, would be&s;t an&s;wer her pre&s;ent purpo&s;e in &s;eeking employment: &s;he therefore re&s;olved to learn German: and &s;he hoped, in the labours of her under&s;tanding, to forget the &s;orrows of her heart. She entered, there|fore, upon her ta&s;k with avidity. Her ma&s;ter attended her every day: and the eagerne&s;s with which &s;he bent her whole mind to the bu&s;ine&s;s, with her natural talents, &s;oon convinced her, that the difficulties of the language had been exaggerated. She was not, however, di&s;appoint|ed in the main end. The newne&s;s of the pur|&s;uit intere&s;ted her. It filled her time; and it filled her thoughts. It prevented her thinking of her&s;elf.&mdash;Employment (thought &s;he) is the great &s;ecret of contentment.</P>
<P>She had been thus bu&s;ied about ten days, when Sir William, whom &s;he &s;eldom &s;aw in the cour&s;e of the day for more than a few minutes at a time, and who knew nothing of her new employment, unexpectedly entered her apart|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="036127_0286_10085198E7D2B7A8">He a&s;ked in Engli&s;h, angrily and eagerly, what &s;he was about</P>
<P>'I am learning German,' &s;aid Ellen with a &s;mile.</P>
<P>'And do you not know languages enough?' returned he rudely. 'What affectation is this of the love of &s;tudy?'</P>
<P>Ellen doubted whether &s;he heard him aright. Among all the foibles of Sir William's cha|racter, he had always appeared wholly free from the mean jealou&s;y, which &s;ome men betray, of female talents and female acquirements. On the contrary, &s;he had often heard him declare, that in marrying, he had &s;ought not merely a mi&s;tre&s;s but a companion: and he had &s;aid, that his choice of her had been as much determined by the cultivation of her mind, as by the attrac|tions of her per&s;on, or the &s;weetne&s;s of her temper.</P>
<P>It is true, the&s;e were the fondne&s;&s;es of his early love; and might be, with re&s;pect to her|&s;elf, no more than the flatteries of it. But &s;he had invariably &s;een him &s;eek the &s;ociety of the be&s;t-informed females: and he had always ap|peared to have a more than common plea&s;ure in their conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>She knew not, therefore, what to impute his &s;udden di&s;plea&s;ure to, on his di&s;covery of her de&s;ire to add another language to tho&s;e which &s;he already under&s;tood.</P>
<P>'You are not &s;erious,' &s;aid &s;he, 'that my attempt to learn German gives you offence?'</P>
<P>'Perfectly &s;o, and I de&s;ire you will immediately di&s;mi&s;s that gentleman there, and inform him that you &s;hall not again require his attendance.'</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="036127_0287_10083875F60BBD38">Ellen turning to the German, told him, in French, that &s;he was at pre&s;ent particularly en|gaged; and that &s;he would let him know when &s;he again wi&s;hed to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>The man departed: and Ellen turning to Sir William &s;aid, 'Pray, what am I to under&s;tand from all this?'</P>
<P>'That it is my will, that you do not learn German; and that any farther attempt to acquire the language will be, on your part, an act of di&s;obedience.'</P>
<P>'You have &s;o little u&s;ed me to &s;o authori|tative a &s;tyle, that you mu&s;t forgive me, if I &s;ay I am &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed with it.'</P>
<P>'I knew the new philo&s;ophy of matrimony, as with every thing el&s;e, is equality. But I be|lieve we were united upon the old terms of the wife's obedience and &s;ubordination: and there ought to be nothing &s;urpri&s;ing, if I exact from you no more than what you voluntarily engaged to perform.'</P>
<P>'I thought I under&s;tood,' returned Ellen, 'that you preferred receiving your rights in the free-will offerings of love, rather than in the tribute of duty.

<P>'If there ever were a time when I had &s;uch an option,' &s;aid Sir William with a &s;igh, 'is it not gone for ever? Will you, (added he, after &s;ome little pau&s;e) will you order your maid to fold up tho&s;e books? pointing to the German grammar, &amp;c. that lay upon the table, 'and I will put my &s;eal on them.'</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="036127_0288_1008519C90AB9FB8">'I will do it my&s;elf,' &s;aid Ellen: and immedi|ately wrapping up all the books and papers re|lating to the intended &s;tudy, &s;he bound them round with a &s;tring, lighted her taper, and pre|&s;ented the parcel, and a &s;tick of &s;ealing wax to Sir William.</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus employed, Sir William regarded her with the mo&s;t fixed and melan|choly attention. Pre&s;erving an invariable &s;i|lence, he took the wax from her, melted it at the taper, dropped &s;ome drops on the &s;tring, and impre&s;&s;ed it with his &s;eal, then ca&s;ting up his eyes, 'Oh!' exclaimed he, with a deep &s;igh, 'that there were a po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt! that I might be again deceived!' and, &s;o &s;aying, he hur|ried out of the room.</P>
<P>'Mi&s;erable incon&s;i&s;tency!' &s;aid Ellen, &s;inking quite oppre&s;&s;ed into a chair, 'thus ardently to de&s;ire to be beloved, thus a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to de&s;troy all ground for affection.'</P>
<P>After this incident Sir William &s;eemed as if more than ever to &s;hun being alone with Ellen. He appeared as if afraid that &s;he might re&s;ume her influence over his mind.

<P>The pre&s;ent depre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of her mind, and the remembrance of the bitter di&s;appointment

in which her former hopes from the &s;ame &s;ource had ended, deprived her of the power of look|ing forward to the birth of her child either a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an alleviation to her own &s;orrows, or as the probable beginning of a &s;tate of happine&s;s to ano|ther human being.</P>
<P>In this manner the winter pa&s;&s;ed away at Dre&s;|den. Sir William had been more than once ab&s;ent from her for two or three nights at a time, either engaged in vi&s;its to &s;uch of his former friends as re&s;ided at &s;ome di&s;tance from Dre&s;den, or in the pur&s;uit of the &s;ports of the field. For the latter purpo&s;e he declared his intention, in the early part of the &s;pring, of e&s;tabli&s;hing him|&s;elf, for &s;ome little time, in a Saxon village, on the confines of Bohemia.

<P>Ellen had no reluctance to accompany him. She rather hoped advantage from change of place, than dreaded any increa&s;e to her pre&s;ent chagrins; and Dre&s;den had been to her too melancholy a &s;ojourn not to find &s;ome relief in bidding it adieu.</P>

<P>THEY were &s;oon &s;ettled in a &s;mall hou&s;e little better than a cottage, in a &s;mall Saxon village, &s;ituated in the mountain that &s;eparates Saxony from Bohemia. Here, however, having previou&s;|ly provided them&s;elves with every nece&s;&s;ary at Dre&s;den, they wanted none of the comforts and conveniences of life to which they had been ac|cu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;oon began to think her &s;ituation much improved. The manners and appearance of the villagers became extremely intere&s;ting to her. In a little hamlet, &s;carcely containing twenty hou|&s;es, &s;urrounded by exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, and appa|rently &s;hut up by rugged and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible rocks from all intercour&s;e with civilized life, Ellen &s;ound a gaiety, a ho&s;pitality, a &s;ociability of manners, which &s;he had often in vain &s;ought for in more poli&s;hed &s;ocieties. The&s;e were accompanied, it is true, by the harde&s;t labour: but the virtuous exertions of individuals for the &s;upport of their re&s;pective families, &s;eemed to be the &s;ource of no ob&s;truction to the general hilarity.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="036127_0291_100851A7D5159158">Ellen al&s;o ob&s;erved, with plea&s;ure, that almo&s;t every body could read, and that this general dif|fu&s;ion of knowledge was far from being an ob|&s;tacle to any of the cares of the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous hou&s;ewifery. Clean, active, and &s;pirited, the women particularly charmed her by the beauty of their &s;hapes, and the animation of their looks; and &s;he more than ever regretted the want of a common language between them and her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of this ob&s;truction to their more intimate intercour&s;e, Ellen &s;pent much of her time in the cottages and in walks through the adjacent woods. She longed to clamber a|mong the rocks, as &s;he had been accu&s;to|med to do in happier days in dear Northum|berland. But this her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances forbade.</P>
<P>Sir William was &s;o frequently ab&s;ent, that he knew little how &s;he pa&s;&s;ed her time; and had he known, it could have made no objec|tion.</P>
<P>One of her favourite walks was round the back part of the village through a &s;mall wood, which led along the &s;ide of a rivulet, which coming &s;uddenly to an abrupt and &s;omewhat &s;teep rock, overgrown by bru&s;h-wood, threw it&s;elf down with a precipitancy that produced in miniature one of the mo&s;t beautiful ca&s;|cades imaginable. The path wound gently be|low this rock: and the rivulet, after its fall, re&s;uming its calmne&s;s, flowed quietly along the valley.</P>
<P>Immediately at the foot of this rock was placed a cottage, which, from its &s;ituation and the accompanying features of the &s;urrounding
<PB N="80" REF="036127_0292_100852BBEA8A7CD8">
&s;cene, was picture&s;que beyond de&s;cription: and Ellen had often &s;tood contemplating it from above with a plea&s;ure inexpre&s;&s;ible; and often had &s;he de&s;cended to re&s;t her&s;elf on the bench at its door, and to receive the welcome re|fre&s;hment of a bowl of milk, with which its ho&s;pitable inhabitants were always willing to &s;upply her.</P>
<P>One morning &s;he directed her &s;teps to the favorite &s;pot; and, finding her&s;elf more than u&s;ually fatigued with her walk, thought with uncommon &s;atisfaction of her re&s;ting-place, the bench. What then was her grief and di&s;ap|pointment, when, arriving on the top of the rock, from whence fir&s;t the cottage could be &s;een, &s;he looked for it in vain? The cottage was no more: but from its &s;cite aro&s;e a curling &s;moke, which told with too much certainty its fate. Of &s;elf in &s;uch a moment no one would have thought. Ellen knew not that &s;he exi&s;ted; but an with a precipitancy round the rock, that left her no breath when &s;he arrived at the bot|tom of it.</P>
<P>Here &s;he found the ruined and de&s;olated fa|mily given up to all the horrors of de&s;pair. It con&s;i&s;ted of a mother, two daughters, and three children, the offspring of one of the daugh|ters, the hu&s;band of whom, a miner, being at pre&s;ent engaged at &s;ome di&s;tance from his home, had left the helple&s;s females without that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which would probably have aver|ted a calamity, which, with a lamentation u&s;e|le&s;s as their own, he would now only be able to deplore.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="036127_0293_1008387F2B7F6BF8">On the &s;ight of Ellen, all the poor &s;ufferers gathered around her. The old woman gra&s;ped her hand; the children caught hold of her clothes; the mother pointed to her ruined cottage, and then to her infants. The appeal was irre&s;i&s;table. There was no need of language. The note of &s;upplication is the &s;ame in all. Ellen's heart was ever re&s;pon&s;ive to its cry. She returned the pre&s;|&s;ure of the old woman's hand; &s;he embraced the children; &s;he took out her pur&s;e; it contained not much; for the &s;upplies of Sir William were no longer regular. But happily much was not wanted. The ruin, it is true, was complete; but the means of recovery were not very extend|ed. Ellen gave all &s;he had. It appeared a mine of wealth to the receivers: and their ex|pre&s;&s;ions of gratitude were more than the feeling heart of Ellen could bear. The bench was gone. But &s;he &s;at down on a &s;tone: and the younger &s;i&s;ter, who was the fir&s;t to ob&s;erve her emotion, ran ha&s;tily to the rivulet, and brought her a little water in a wooden bowl. Ellen drank it; was relieved; and ro&s;e to depart. Again the grati|tude of the now happy family threw them at her feet.</P>
<P>At length, e&s;caped from the&s;e, to her, painful effu&s;ions of their feelings, Ellen turned her &s;teps homewards with a lightened pur&s;e, but with a heart ten times more lightened. She had not known a &s;en&s;ation &s;o delightful &s;ince the day in which &s;he had relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the grand|&s;on of old Deborah.</P>
<P>Oh! &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, how little do tho&s;e know of happine&s;s, who confine it to the grati|fication of &s;elf!</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="036127_0294_100851ABC3FC4B50">Ellen now grew &s;o near the time of her con|finement, that &s;he began earne&s;tly to wi&s;h that Sir William would remove from their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. It had been determined that &s;he &s;hould lie-in at Vienna; and that from thence, after her recovery, they &s;hould pro&s;ecute their tour; a tour, which Ellen no longer wi&s;hed to be extend|ed. Her wi&s;hes were fixed on England: and &s;he &s;ometimes thought, if &s;he might be permit|ted to return thither, with a healthy baby in her arms, &s;he might &s;till &s;ecure to her&s;elf a tole|rable portion of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Day after day pa&s;&s;ed away: and Sir William &s;till found new rea&s;ons for continuing where they were: but at length their removal could he delayed no longer, if indeed Ellen was to arrive at Vienna before her lying-in.</P>
<P>Sir William had for &s;ome time pa&s;t &s;u&s;pended the uncea&s;ing attention, which, on their fir&s;t leaving England, he had &s;hewn to the per&s;onal attendants upon Ellen. Her pre&s;ent &s;ervant had lived with her &s;ince her arrival at Dre&s;den, and &s;he had no rea&s;on to wi&s;h to change her. Two days, however, before the day on which it was now fixed they &s;hould leave the village, Sir Wil|liam expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t pointed di&s;approbation of her; told of his &s;u&s;picions of her hone&s;ty; complained of her impertinence; and de&s;ired Ellen would di&s;mi&s;s her.</P>
<P>Ellen could not help a little remon&s;trating again&s;t a reque&s;t, the compliance with which would expo&s;e her to all the fatigues and incon|veniencies of a long journey in her pre&s;ent help|le&s;s circum&s;tances, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to: and &s;he propo&s;ed
<PB N="83" REF="036127_0295_100851AD4B67FBA0">
that &s;he might be allowed to retain her &s;ervant until her arrival at Vienna, when &s;he &s;aid &s;he would willingly di&s;charge her. Sir William urged her immediate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion: and whatever were the inconveniencies that Ellen might fear from it, &s;he thought them le&s;s than tho&s;e which attended a conte&s;t with Sir William. She there|fore acquie&s;ced: and Sir William promi&s;ed to &s;eek out &s;ome pea&s;ant's daughter, who might accompany them on their journey, and continue with Ellen until &s;he could find &s;omebody more to her mind at Vienna.</P>
<P>Fortunately his enquiries were an&s;wered by a young per&s;on who was ju&s;t returning from &s;er|vice at Dre&s;den: and &s;he willingly con&s;ented to attend upon Ellen as long as &s;he wi&s;hed her to do &s;o. The caprice which Sir William mani|fe&s;ted in the&s;e particulars, was not confined to the attendants upon Ellen. He had repeatedly parted with his own per&s;onal &s;ervants: and at this time their whole &s;uite con&s;i&s;ted of the newly hired Saxon girl and one footman.</P>
<P>'We will e&s;tabli&s;h our&s;elves comfortably at Vienna,' &s;aid Sir William. 'Already we have a good hou&s;e taken there: and I have de&s;ired a female friend of mine to hire us &s;ervants. I will now add to the li&s;t a femme de chambre for you.'</P>
<P>'My dear Sir William,' &s;aid Ellen pre&s;&s;ing his hand, 'how happy &s;hould I be, if you would realize your words&mdash;if <HI>indeed</HI> we might have a comfortable e&s;tabli&s;hment <HI>any where.</HI> Long have we wanted it: and yet every comfort and every happine&s;s &s;eem to be in our power.'</P>
<P>'Be &s;atisfied,' &s;aid Sir William. 'All will &s;oon be as it ought to be.'</P>

<P>THE road from the village where Sir Willi|am and Ellen then were, to the great road which leads from Dre&s;den to Prague, was intri|cate, and in &s;ome degree difficult: but Sir Wil|liam relied on his knowledge of the country; and undertook to in&s;truct the drivers of the carriage the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t way.</P>
<P>They left the village early in the morning; and hoped to be able to reach a tolerable good inn on the direct road from Dre&s;den to Prague before a late hour at night. But either Sir Wil|liam deceived him&s;elf in the degree of informa|tion he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or he never &s;eriou&s;ly intended to arrive at the &s;pot marked out.</P>
<P>The day's journey was fatiguing, the roads rugged, often alarming, and they found them|&s;elves, at the clo&s;e of night, entering into a thick fore&s;t, which by no means an&s;wered the de|&s;cription that had been given of any of the en|virons of the place they had been directed to.</P>
<P>Ellen, who &s;eldom felt vain or unfounded fear, was more fatigued than alarmed. She did not think any danger threatened her: but &s;he
<PB N="85" REF="036127_0297_100851B1CF268658">
felt her &s;trength &s;o much exhau&s;ted, that &s;he apprehended &s;he &s;hould not be able to &s;upport her&s;elf much longer.</P>
<P>Sir William expre&s;&s;ed a very lively compa&s;&s;ion for her &s;ituation; and endeavoured by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y means in his power to rai&s;e her drooping &s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;pirits. The gloom of the fore&s;t and the darkne&s;s of the night made it hazardous to at|tempt finding a road through the wood. Yet there &s;eemed to be no alternative, except the remaining where they were in the carriage all night. Ellen propo&s;ed this: but Sir William en|couraging her with the hopes that this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> really a fore&s;t with which he was well acquain|ted, and in the mid&s;t of which was &s;ituated a hunting box, where, if he were not mi&s;taken in the place, he was a&s;&s;ured they would be able to meet with &s;ome accommodation; it was at length determined to endeavour to find their way through the wood.</P>
<P>They proceeded very pro&s;perou&s;ly for &s;ome time; and had begun to hope that even &s;hould they not find any hou&s;e, they might at lea&s;t be able, without accident, to penetrate thro' the fore&s;t. But at the moment they indulged the&s;e hopes, the po&s;tillion, not able to &s;ee the track, drove over a fallen tree that lay on one &s;ide of it, and overturned the carriage.</P>
<P>Sir William was &s;upporting Ellen in his arms at the in&s;tant the accident happened; and hap|pily contrived &s;o to break the &s;hock of the fall to her, that &s;he received no material injury. It was, however, from the darkne&s;s of the night, and the po&s;ition of the carriage, with difficulty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat they were able to di&s;engage them&s;elves from
<PB N="86" REF="036127_0298_100851B51E45F060">
it: and even when they were all &s;afely placed on the ground, they knew not what next to do.</P>
<P>The carriage was broken: and to have at|tempted to mend it in the pre&s;ent darkne&s;s would have been a fruitle&s;s labour. It rained h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily: and Ellen was wholly unable to pro|&s;ecute her journey on foot, when every &s;tep &s;he took might lead her &s;till farther from her way, and from every nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. To &s;tay where they were, without &s;helter, chilled with cold, and drenched in rain, with no re&s;t|ing-place but the wet ground, &s;eemed to threat|en the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences to Ellen.</P>
<P>Sir William appeared half di&s;tracted, repeat|ing every moment, 'Good God! what have I done?' The &s;ervants exclaimed, 'What &s;hall we do?' The poor Saxon girl wept bitterly: and Ellen, when a little recovered from the fir&s;t &s;hock, &s;eemed the only per&s;on capable of a ra|tional thought.</P>
<P>'I cannot &s;tand,' &s;aid &s;he, almo&s;t &s;inking from Sir William's arms as &s;he &s;poke. 'But if you can contrive to get at the little &s;eat on which I re&s;ted my feet in the carriage, I can &s;it here 'till the po&s;tillions have a little a&s;cer|tained where we are. If this is really the fo|re&s;t you take it for, we cannot be far from the hunting box you have de&s;cribed; from thence we may po&s;&s;ibly procure light, and &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as will enable us either to remove thi|ther, or &s;o to rai&s;e the carriage, that we may remain &s;afe and &s;heltered from the weather the remainder of the night.</P>
<P>Sir William pre&s;&s;ed her tenderly to his heart, as if at once to thank her for her calmne&s;s and re&s;olution, and to re-animate his own.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="036127_0299_100851B94BF33058">The &s;eat was &s;oon found: and Sir William placing Ellen in it, knelt behind her and &s;up|ported her in his arms. He then gave orders for one of the po&s;tillions and his own &s;ervant to pur&s;ue the track they were in, which, he &s;aid, if he were right in his conjectures concerning the place, mu&s;t bring them in le&s;s than a mile to the &s;pot he had mentioned. There they had only to mention his name, and tell his di&s;tre&s;s; and he was a&s;&s;ured of every a&s;&s;i&s;tance that could be given.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants were ab&s;ent nearly an hour: and Ellen was &s;o much overcome by fatigue, the beat|ing of the rain, and above all by the uncommon kind of di&s;tre&s;s that &s;eemed to have &s;eized Sir William&mdash;for as he joined his face to hers, &s;he felt his tears trickle down her cheeks&mdash;that when they returned, &s;he had &s;carcely power to benefit by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they brought.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t cheering part of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance was light. But that which afforded the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice was a &s;mall tilted cart, the bottom of which was well covered with &s;traw. Upon this, Sir William contrived to place the cu&s;hions of the carriage, &s;o as to form a tolerable bed: and having, by the help of the light, been enabled to get at a box of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ordials, he made Ellen take &s;ome of them; and then with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ervants ea&s;ily lifted her into the cart: here he al&s;o placed the maid &s;ervant, who, &s;hivering, wet and crying, made a mo&s;t deplorable figure. The trunk that contained the night clothes fur|ni&s;hed her with a &s;eat: and Sir William, making one of the men who had come from the hou&s;e, lead the way with the lanthern, he him&s;elf
<PB N="88" REF="036127_0300_100851BAD4431688">
mounting one of the chai&s;e hor&s;es, accompanied the cavalcade by the &s;ide of the cart.</P>
<P>In this manner, they proceeded rather more than a mile; and reached the hou&s;e without any new accident, and with little farther incon|venience.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object was to change Ellen's clothes, and put her to bed: and when this was accom|pli&s;hed, Sir William made her take &s;uch refre&s;h|ments as could be procured; and then left her in the hope that &s;he would repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor was his hope vain. Worn out with fa|tigue, &s;he &s;oon dropped a&s;leep; and after &s;ome hours of re&s;t, awoke much recruited.</P>
<P>Sir William appeared extremely plea&s;ed, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was a&s;&s;ured the adventures of the preceding night had been attended with no e&s;&s;ential ill con|&s;equences. He propo&s;ed to continue where they were, through the day, both becau&s;e it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary the carriage &s;hould be repaired, and as a farther refre&s;hment to Ellen.</P>
<P>Towards the evening of the day, Sir William told her, that he had indeed widely mi&s;taken the way he meant to have taken; and that he found he had wandered very di&s;tant from that which led into the public road to Prague: but that the mi&s;take had brought him &s;o near the man&s;ion of an old friend, that, except for the inconvenience that had occurred to her, he could not lament it.</P>
<P>He then mentioned the name of a lady, with who&s;e &s;on Ellen knew he had formerly been extremely connected: and he &s;poke in the high|e&s;t terms of the ho&s;pitality and kindne&s;s which &s;he had always &s;hewn him.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="036127_0301_100851BF4EA12DA0">'We are not more than &s;ix miles from her hou&s;e,' &s;aid he: 'and I &s;hould never forgive my&s;elf, if I were to be &s;o near without paying my re&s;pects to her. The carriage is now mend|ed: we will go together: &s;he will he delighted to &s;ee you: and I &s;hall be &s;urpri&s;ed, from what I know of her character, if &s;he does not offer you an a&s;ylum with her, till you are in a fitter &s;tate to undertake a long journey. The misfor|tunes of ye&s;terday have made me a coward. When I think of the length of the travel that is before you, I tremble for the con&s;equences.'</P>
<P>Ellen declared her&s;elf very able to pro&s;ecute her journey to Vienna; and avowed the prefer|ence &s;he &s;hould give being in a hou&s;e of her own, during her confinement, to any accommo|dations, however comfortable, that might be af|forded her in another.</P>
<P>'Well, we need not &s;ettle this now,' &s;aid Sir William. 'We will act as we &s;ee occa&s;ion. This night, at lea&s;t, we will pa&s;s with my old friend. But can you di&s;pen&s;e with the atten|dance of your maid? I never &s;aw &s;uch a fool. She blubbers and &s;hivers yet. I &s;hould be very glad to exclude her from the party, and for one night&mdash;'</P>
<P>'Oh! I can do very well without her,' inter|rupted Ellen: 'and indeed I &s;hall be glad to &s;ave her any farther fatigue for a few hours. She has rea&s;on for her tears. She is extremely brui&s;ed and hurt; and is &s;o &s;tiff with the cold &s;he caught la&s;t night, that &s;he can hardly move. I &s;hall de&s;ire that &s;he go to bed, and continue there till we rejoin her at this place to-morrow.'</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="036127_0302_100851C2775E8F80">All this being arranged, Sir William and Ellen began their little journey. But it &s;eemed as if Sir William was doomed to be convicted of ig|norance whenever he boa&s;ted of his knowledge of the country. The &s;ix miles &s;eemed to be lengthened into twice that number: and it was already nearly dark, and yet there was no ap|pearance of the habitation to which they were going.</P>
<P>'Surely you cannot be again mi&s;taken,' &s;aid Ellen. 'I &s;hould be &s;orry to pa&s;s &s;uch another night as the la&s;t.'</P>
<P>'There is no mi&s;take this time,' returned Sir William rather peevi&s;hly, 'nor any danger.'</P>
<P>'But &s;urely we mu&s;t have come much more than &s;ix miles.'</P>
<P>'Don't you &s;ee the roads are bad and tedi|ous?'</P>
<P>'I fear arriving at an un&s;ea&s;onable hour, and that your old friend, though glad to &s;ee us, may be put to &s;ome inconvenience.'</P>
<P>'I never knew women direct their fears aright. I intreat you not to perplex your&s;elf with what does not concern you.'</P>
<P>Ellen remained &s;ilent and &s;ad. The deep|ning &s;hades of night added to the unea&s;ine&s;s of her &s;en&s;ations: and a confu&s;ed apprehen&s;ion of, &s;he hardly knew what, &s;tole over her mind. At length they arrived at the top of a long avenue: and Sir William calling ha&s;tily to the man to &s;top, 'This,' &s;aid he to Ellen, 'is the place. I will get out, and announce our arrival before the carriage can be heard at the hou&s;e; le&s;t our appearance at &s;o late an hour may alarm the old lady.

<P>So &s;aying, Sir William jumped out of the carriage, and left Ellen, wondering, di&s;turbed, and unhappy. The &s;ervants obeyed the direc|tions given, and in about the time pre&s;cribed followed Sir William.</P>

<P>THE avenue was clo&s;ed at the other end by a large pair of gates, which opened into a court &s;urrounded by buildings. The gates they found open, and were directed, by a light immedi|ately oppo&s;ite, to drive up to the door of the hou&s;e. Here they found Sir William.</P>
<P>'We are extremely unlucky,' &s;aid he as he opened the chai&s;e door, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted Ellen to get out. 'My old friend has &s;pent the winter at Prague, a thing &s;he never did when I knew her: and &s;he is not yet returned.'</P>
<P>'Then,' &s;aid Ellen, &s;hrinking back, 'let us return. The night is fine: and now we kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w the road, it will not appear half &s;o tedious as it did in coming.'</P>
<P>'No, no, I will not &s;uffer that. I have &s;till a friend in the garri&s;on. We &s;hall be well ac|commodated to-night: and I will not again expo&s;e my&s;elf to your unrea&s;onable fears of darkne&s;s and rugged roads.'</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="036127_0305_100851CD392F7B08">'That's a reproach I hardly de&s;erve,' &s;aid El|len &s;miling. 'But be it as you will.'</P>
<P>She then entered the door, which opened into a long and narrow pa&s;&s;age, and in which there was no other light than that which Sir William held in his hand. He led the way: and they &s;oon found them&s;elves in a hall, not very &s;pacious but very gloomy. Here they were met by a re&s;pectable looking per&s;on, who had al&s;o a light in her hand. She was a wo|man of about fifty, and &s;eemed to regard El|len with looks of the mo&s;t &s;crutinizing curio|&s;ity.</P>
<P>'That's my old friend the hou&s;ekeeper,' &s;aid Sir William: 'and &s;he a&s;&s;ures me her lady would never forgive her, if &s;he were to turn us from her doors at this time of night.'</P>
<P>Ellen was going to make her acknowledge|ments, in French: but Sir William &s;aid, 'You may &s;pare your civilities; for the old dame un|der&s;tands not a word of any language, but her native German.'</P>
<P>'Upon how many occa&s;ions lately,' exclaim|ed Ellen, 'have I had rea&s;on to regret my igno|rance of that language!' Then from a &s;udden feeling, that this might &s;ound as a taunt to Sir William, who had refu&s;ed her permi&s;&s;ion to learn it, &s;he added, 'but all cau&s;e for regret will &s;oon be over. Once returned to dear England, and I hope we &s;hall &s;peak only Engli&s;h for the re&s;t of our lives.'</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, the light that the woman h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld fell full on the face of Sir Willian, and Ellen &s;aw with &s;urpri&s;e the &s;udden alteration of his countenance. He ca&s;t up his eyes, with a look
<PB N="94" REF="036127_0306_100851CEC5644790">
almo&s;t of horror, and repeated, 'Once returned to England!'</P>
<P>Ellen took hold of his arm, and perceived it trembled. But at this moment their attendant opened a door; and they entered a large and to|lerably furni&s;hed parlour, where there was a bla|zing wood fire, and two lighted candles placed on a table before it.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants &s;aid &s;omething to Sir William, to which he gave an an&s;wer apparently of a&s;&s;ent. She went out: and Sir William giving Ellen a chair, threw him&s;elf into another, and &s;eemed lo&s;t in thought.</P>
<P>Ellen regarded him with &s;urpri&s;e for a few moments; and at length ventured to &s;ay, 'are you not well?'</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of her voice, Sir William &s;tar|ted from his reverie; and &s;aid, 'Well? yes, very well, I believe: but I am hungry. Our old lady has promi&s;ed us &s;ome &s;upper. I care not how &s;oon &s;he keeps her word.'</P>
<P>Then endeavouring to appear in &s;pirits, he would have rallied Ellen on the apprehen&s;ions he &s;aid &s;he betrayed on the road. But his cheer|fulne&s;s was evidently forced: and, before the &s;ervant returned, Sir William had again &s;unk into thoughtfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>It was not long before the hou&s;ekeeper made her appearance, accompanied by another female with preparations for &s;upper: and pre&s;ently after, the &s;upper was on the table</P>
<P>The meal, for which Sir William had expre&s;|&s;ed &s;o much de&s;ire, was not reli&s;hed by him in a manner that ju&s;tified the impatience he had &s;hewn for its appearance. Ellen pre&s;&s;ed him to
<PB N="95" REF="036127_0307_100851D1E7884128">
eat, and, yielding to her intreaties, he took &s;ome fowl on his plate: but Ellen ob&s;erved, that the moment her eye was withdrawn, he &s;eemed to forget that it was there; and fixed a melancholy and di&s;turbed look upon her.</P>
<P>In making the&s;e ob&s;ervations, Ellen lo&s;t all appetite al&s;o; and the &s;upper was &s;erved and ta|ken away without having been much dimini&s;hed by either.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervants were gone, Sir William &s;hivering, drew his chair near the fire.</P>
<P>'I am &s;ure you are unwell,' &s;aid Ellen anxi|ou&s;ly. 'It is hardly po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould have been expo&s;ed &s;o many hours to &s;uch weather as we were out in la&s;t night, with impuni|ty. Do you think Madam Hou&s;ekeeper has no family medicine that might be of &s;ervice to you? &s;omething that would make you per&s;pire might remove all your complaints before morn|ing?'</P>
<P>Sir William &s;eemed not to hear her: and the &s;huddering with which he was &s;eized, had more the appearance of proceeding from emotion, than from cold. Ellen felt dreadfully alarm|ed. She took his hand, but dropped it &s;ud|dently, &s;tartled with the burning heat which it communicated to her own. 'You are feveri&s;h &mdash;you are ill&mdash;for God's &s;ake let us inquire what there is in the hou&s;e that it will be proper for you to take.'</P>
<P>'Oh! God of heaven and earth!' &s;aid Sir William, with a &s;igh from the bottom of his ve|ry &s;oul.</P>
<P>'Dear Sir William!'</P>
<P>'Dear?&mdash; Oh, Ellen, no, no, no.'</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="036127_0308_100851D36F02F920">Ellen, &s;eized with an in&s;tant fear for his intel|lects, &s;natched up one of the candles, and was making towards the door.</P>
<P>'What are you about? and where would you go?'</P>
<P>'I am going to &s;eek the hou&s;ekeeper. I hope &s;he will be able to furni&s;h me with &s;omething that will be of &s;ervice to you.'</P>
<P>'And if you &s;peak to her, &s;he will not un|der&s;tand you.&mdash;It is true, I am not well. I &s;hiver; I burn; I have an inten&s;e head-ach, the effects all of a violent cold. Something to make me pre&s;pire, and a good night's re&s;t, will &s;et all to rights.'</P>
<P>'God grant it!' &s;aid Ellen fervently.</P>
<P>'There's no doubt,' &s;aid Sir William, as he went out of the room.</P>
<P>He was ab&s;ent nearly a quarter of an hour, which &s;eemed almo&s;t an age to Ellen. When he returned, his looks were compo&s;ed, and his air &s;omewhat more cheerful. He was followed by the &s;ervant they had fir&s;t &s;een, who had a bowl in her hand.</P>
<P>'Our good friend there,' &s;aid Sir William, with a melancholy &s;mile, 'has made me a mix|ture which &s;he &s;ays is &s;overeign for a cold. She has al&s;o prepared me a bed apart from yours, le&s;t I &s;hould di&s;turb you. I will drink your health, and then let us retire to our rooms.' He took the bowl. He fixed his eyes intently on Ellen for a moment, 'Good night, <HI>God ble&s;s you,</HI>' &s;aid he, with an empha&s;is; and rai&s;ing the bowl to his mouth, he drank off the contents. But Ellen perceived that he turned deadly p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, and that his lips trembled.&mdash;Horrible apprehen|&s;ions
<PB N="97" REF="036127_0309_100851D50C325850">
cro&s;&s;ed the mind of Ellen, which &s;he dur&s;t not &s;uffer to harbour there for a moment.</P>
<P>'Will not you have &s;omething warm?' &s;aid Sir William, '&s;ome negus? or whey? I did not offer you any of my potion; for though it may be &s;alutary, it was nau&s;eous.'</P>
<P>'I think I will,' returned Ellen: 'I am cold my&s;elf. I &s;hould be glad of any thing warm.'</P>
<P>Sir William &s;poke to the woman, who in&s;tant|ly withdrew: and Sir William, taking Ellen's hand, drew her towards the fire, 'You look unea&s;y; you look frightened; I a&s;&s;ure you my indi&s;po&s;ition is trifling. I &s;hall be well to-mor|row: and then you will wonder how you came to be &s;o much alarmed. You &s;ay <HI>you</HI> are cold,' added he: 'for <HI>once</HI> let the arms of a hu&s;band warm you.'</P>
<P>He &s;natched her to his heart, and held her there for a moment. Then letting her go, as the door opened, 'Oh! Ellen!' &s;aid he, 'why not thus for ever!'</P>
<P>'For God's &s;ake, tell me what all this means. Either you or I are &s;trangely di&s;ordered.'</P>
<P>'Means!&mdash;It means ju&s;tice&mdash;but come, we will talk it all over to-morrow.' Then taking a bowl from the &s;ervant, who had ju&s;t pre&s;ented it to Ellen&mdash;he put it to his lips, and a&s;&s;uming a cheerful look, 'Excellent white wine whey, I a&s;&s;ure you, much better than mine. Now drink my health.'</P>
<P>'Heaven is my witne&s;s, how &s;incerely I do,' &s;aid Ellen&punc; 'and taking the bowl, &s;he drank a part of what it contained. It appeared to her what Sir William had &s;aid it was, except that
<PB N="98" REF="036127_0310_100851D8F7FDC938">
&s;he thought there was &s;ome ta&s;te in it more un|u&s;ual than di&s;agreeable.'</P>
<P>'Now,' &s;aid Sir William, 'let us go to bed. Re&s;t will do us both good.' Then &s;peaking to the &s;ervant, and again to Ellen, 'If you will fol|low the old lady, &s;he will &s;hew you your a|partment. I know the way to mine.'</P>
<P>'I wi&s;h I might accompany you thither,' &s;aid Ellen earne&s;tly. 'If I were to &s;ee you a&s;leep, my re&s;t would be better.'</P>
<P>'No, no, that mu&s;t not be. You had too di&s;turbed a night la&s;t night, to become a watch|er this. I &s;hall want no attendants: but if it will make you ea&s;y, James &s;hall &s;it up an hour or two in my room: and when I am a&s;leep, he &s;hall let you know.'</P>
<P>Ellen joyfully accepted this offer: and &s;tretch|ing ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her hand to Sir William, &s;he bade him good night. He pre&s;&s;ed it tenderly between his; held it to his lips; and &s;he felt a tear drop up|on it. Yet he &s;poke cheerfully and with uncon|cern: 'Pray lend me your watch. Mine has been &s;poilt in la&s;t night's overthrow, and does not go.'</P>
<P>Ellen gave him her watch; and again bade him good night. He followed her to the door of the room, as if unwilling to lo&s;e &s;ight of her; and as he turned from her, &s;he heard him &s;igh deeply.</P>
<P>Ellen, following her conductor, cro&s;&s;ed the hall, from the upper end of which went a pair of &s;tairs that led to a gallery above, in which were &s;everal doors. The woman opened the &s;e|cond, on the left hand: and Ellen found her&s;elf in a &s;pacious room, the modern furniture of
<PB N="99" REF="036127_0311_100851DD4FFD5688">
which &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed her. Around the fire|place, which was well &s;upplied with fire, were arranged her night dre&s;s, and every thing &s;he could require, in the nice&s;t order. The woman opened a door on one &s;ide of the room, which Ellen &s;aw was de&s;igned for her bedchamber. This al&s;o had a fire in it, and &s;eemed to be pro|vided with every comfort, and with many of tho&s;e accommodations Ellen could not have ex|pected to have found in the apartment of an old Bohem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an lady.</P>
<P>Her attendant offered her &s;ervice to a&s;&s;i&s;t in undre&s;&s;ing her: and Ellen, harra&s;&s;ed in mind and body, was willing to take off a part of her clothes, and put on her dre&s;&s;ing gown. But &s;he meant not to go to bed, until &s;he had heard &s;omething more of Sir William: and &s;he now felt the mo&s;t tormenting perplexity from not being able to explain her&s;elf to her companion, who &s;eemed re&s;olved not to leave her 'till &s;he had &s;een her in bed.</P>
<P>At length it occurred to her, that &s;he might ea&s;ily make her comprehend her wi&s;h to have a written paper delivered to Sir William: and &s;he wrote the&s;e words with a pencil:&mdash;</P>
<P>'Pray inform my too civil attendant, that I wi&s;h her to leave me alone: and be &s;o kind as to direct her to come to me as &s;oon as James can inform her that you are a&s;leep.'</P>
<P>The woman readily under&s;tood what &s;he was to do with the paper. She took it, and in a few moments returned with the&s;e words from Sir William.</P>
<P>'If you have any regard for my health, let the old lady &s;ee you in bed. I promi&s;e you
<PB N="100" REF="036127_0312_100851E082461F70">
&s;he &s;hall bring you good news of me in con&s;e|quence. But if you are left to your&s;elf, I know you will &s;it up all night: and this thought will keep me waking.'</P>
<P>Ellen in return wrote, 'I acquie&s;ce: but re|member your promi&s;e.'</P>
<P>She then &s;uffered her attendant to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in going to bed. She made the woman under|&s;tand that &s;he wi&s;hed to have a light: and this being procured, the woman drew the curtains and left her.</P>
<P>Ellen in her own mind, was confident that &s;he &s;hould not clo&s;e her eyes, until &s;he had heard from Sir William, &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion had his apparent indi&s;po&s;ition both of body and mind made upon her. But her head was &s;carcely laid upon her pillow, before &s;he fell into a &s;leep pro|found as death.</P>
<P>She awoke from this &s;leep with a &s;udden &s;tart, &s;uppo&s;ing that drow&s;ine&s;s had only for a few moments overcome her. But, &s;urpri&s;ed by the kind of light that &s;he &s;aw in her room, which &s;he thought could proceed from neither fire nor candle, &s;he ha&s;tily undrew the curtain; and was amazed and chagrined to find a meridian &s;un &s;hining full upon her bed. She ro&s;e ha&s;tily; and wrapping a few clothes around her, opened the door which led into the next room, de&s;ign|ing to go from thence to the gallery to &s;ee for &s;omebody, of whom &s;he could make inquiries after Sir William. On opening the door, &s;he found in the adjoining room, as if in waiting, the woman who had attended her the night before.</P>
<P>Ellen was proceeding to make her under&s;tand what &s;he wanted, by earne&s;tly rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ating Sir Wil|liam's

name, when the woman delivered her a &s;ealed letter, the direction of which &s;he &s;aw was in his hand. On the &s;ight of this letter, her heart &s;unk within her, as if it foretold all &s;he had to &s;uffer. Yet at the moment &s;he thought not of her&s;elf. She was &s;eized with an univer&s;al trembling. The letter dropt from her hand: and &s;he &s;unk almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s into a chair. Yet how wide were her apprehen&s;ions from the truth! &mdash;For Sir William &s;he only feared: and yet Sir William, withheld by no compa&s;&s;ionate con&s;idera|tion for her, was at this moment con&s;ummating that vengeance for imagined crimes, which he had been &s;o many months in preparing with the coole&s;t deliberation.</P>
<P>The woman, as if &s;he had expected the effect that even the &s;ight of the letter would have, ran readily to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Ellen; poured drops and water down her throat; gave her air; and &s;eemed, by the tone of her voice, to exhort her to patience.</P>
<P>Ellen, who&s;e mind was fixed wholly upon the draught that &s;he had &s;een Sir William &s;wallow the night before, and now convinced that the &s;oundne&s;s of her &s;leep had been procured by me|dicine, could think only of one cata&s;trophe; and regarding the letter with horror, had not courage to open it. The woman took it from the floor; pre&s;ented it to her; and &s;eemed to intreat her to read it.</P>
<P>Confu&s;ed and overwhelmed as Ellen's mind was, there &s;eemed to her &s;omething in this ac|tion of the woman's, which &s;poke the evil not to be &s;o bad as &s;he feared. She took the letter, &s;he broke the &s;eal&mdash;and, in the relief from the
<PB N="102" REF="036127_0314_100851E697419918">
horror which at had fir&s;t &s;eized her, forgot for a few moments the extent of that mi&s;ery which was announced to her&s;elf. The letter was as follows:</P>
<P>'Summon to your &s;upport all that &s;trength of mind, which has &s;o often given me cau&s;e to admire you. Oh! Ellen, had it been uniform, had it &s;prung from principle!&mdash;But away with every vain regret. Where the guilt is certain, all compunction for the puni&s;hment &s;hould cea&s;e: and if the cha&s;ti&s;ement is heavy, you will not affirm it is di&s;proportionate to the crime. It would, however, be u&s;ele&s;s to reproach you. My injured love, my violated honor, cannot &s;peak more &s;everely than will your own heart: and in guarding my&s;elf from the po&s;&s;ibility of being again deceived, I wi&s;h not to inflict any unnece&s;|&s;ary rigour.</P>
<P>'When you know, that I was appri&s;ed, by the conviction of my own &s;en&s;es, of the la&s;t vi&s;it you received from your undoer&mdash;when you are told that I read the invitation for a repeti|tion of his vi&s;it under &s;uch forms as would elude &s;u&s;picion and lay jealou&s;y to &s;leep&mdash;you will not wonder, that in a cau&s;e which would not admit of doubt, I have thought all explanation unnece&s;|&s;ary; or that being convinced of having been once betrayed, I re&s;olved upon &s;uch mea&s;ures, as would &s;ecure me from the po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;econd in&s;ult.</P>
<P>'In knowing that I never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed your heart, I ought, perhaps, to have fore&s;een all that fol|lowed. But, deceived by the appearance of an integrity and candour, which, un&s;upported as they were by reality, will remain, I confidently
<PB N="103" REF="036127_0315_100851E927FC01F8">
believe, unparalleled, the warnings of my rea&s;on were unheard, and the mi&s;givings of my mind were di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>'How often has the &s;emblance of a &s;incerity, which, had it been genuine, angels might have copied with advantage, baffled the precautions of prudence, and &s;u&s;pended the rod of ju&s;tice? But the veil is now fallen: and even you can elude no longer. Here then let all retro&s;pect end.</P>
<P>'You need not be told, how a hu&s;band ought to feel and act on &s;uch a di&s;covery. Yet the agonies you witne&s;&s;ed in me this night, with &s;o much alarm, may &s;hew you, that I am not yet free from that weakne&s;s, which has &s;o long enabled you to deceive me. It may &s;hew you, that the mea&s;ures which ju&s;tice and honor de|manded from me, are not pur&s;ued without a torture of mind equal to any I can inflict upon you. If this conviction can lighten the de&s;tiny which from henceforward awaits you, I grudge you not &s;uch an alleviation, poor, undone, mi&s;e|rable wretch as you are!</P>
<P>'Again I entreat you to collect every power of your mind. Con&s;ider, it is no &s;ingle life that is at &s;take. Suffer not any extravagance of grief, any exce&s;s of de&s;pair, to hazard an exi&s;|tence, which you cannot believe you have a right to di&s;po&s;e of. Take pity al&s;o on your&s;elf. If you would pre&s;erve one ray of hope to gild your future life, de&s;troy not, by any extravagance of grief in the pre&s;ent moment, the only &s;ource from which it can proceed.</P>
<P>'I expect not that a creature which mu&s;t par|take of my nature &s;hall be dear to you, as was
<PB N="104" REF="036127_0316_100851EAB1657648">
that cheri&s;hed darling in which I had no part. But if it be mine, it is al&s;o yours. Let that con&s;ideration make it an object of your care; and add not the guilt of murder to tho&s;e other crimes which &s;o deeply &s;tain your con&s;cience.</P>
<P>'This is not the upbraiding of re&s;entment. It is the warning of friend&s;hip. Take it as &s;uch: and may you be enabled to endure, with tole|rable moderation, the &s;everity of a puni&s;hment, the ju&s;tice of which you will not di&s;pute.

<P>'You will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity I have been under of depriving you of the &s;olace of conver&s;ation, and of leaving you de&s;titute of all property.

Nece&s;&s;ity would then induce a much more rigorous confinement, an infinitely &s;everer re&s;traint.</P>
<P>'When you reflect how much it imports me to perpetuate a confinement which I have once begun, you will not doubt but that I have taken

<P>ELLEN read this letter with an a&s;toni&s;hment which &s;u&s;pended for a time all powers of recol|lection or feeling. She could neither believe nor comprehend what &s;he read. Never once had the idea that Sir William &s;u&s;pected her of guilt beyond the e&s;trangement of her affections, cro&s;&s;ed her mind; nor could the evidence of her &s;en&s;es now convince her that &s;he was judged, condemn|ed, and puni&s;hed unheard.</P>
<P>'Where is Sir William?' cried &s;he, ru&s;hing to the door, forgetful that &s;he &s;poke to tho&s;e who under&s;tood her not, and thoughtle&s;s of the di&s;|order of her dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The woman mi&s;took this motion for an attempt to e&s;cape; and, placing her&s;elf between Ellen and the door, endeavoured, though with re&s;pect and gentlene&s;s, to detain her.</P>
<P>'Let me go,' &s;aid Ellen &s;truggling. 'Let me &s;ee Sir William. I implore you, let me &s;ee Sir William.</P>
<P>The woman &s;hook her head in token of the impo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bility of a compliance: and again &s;he offered her the letter, which Ellen had a &s;econd time let fall to the ground. On this oppo&s;ition

from her attendant, a &s;udden recollection &s;truck Ellen.&mdash;She remembered that &s;he &s;poke in vain, and that her pre&s;ent efforts were probably mi&s;|under&s;tood. Again &s;he read the letter: but &s;he read it with nearly as little comprehen&s;ion of the contents as before.</P>
<P>Totally ignorant of the circum&s;tances on which &s;he had been condemned, and &s;ure of her own innocence, &s;he could not believe that Sir William could think her guilty. She could not believe that, unheard, he could puni&s;h her as guilty.</P>
<P>As &s;he continued to read, &s;he looked for &s;ome hidden &s;en&s;e in words, which &s;he could not con|ceive to be u&s;ed in that which was obvious. When &s;he came to the expre&s;&s;ion, 'From hence|forward, you will never go beyond the bounda|ries of the habitation in which you are now placed,' &s;he looked towards the high windows, and around the room, with an air at once wild and thoughtful. Then covering her face with her hands, &s;he endeavoured to collect her &s;en&s;es, and be a&s;&s;ured that &s;he did not dream.</P>
<P>Again &s;he turned to peru&s;e the letter, and to weigh every &s;yllable of it. But &s;he had read it many times, before &s;he was able to give it cre|dit as a reality, or was awakened to a full &s;ence of her true &s;ituation. At length, convinced that Sir William was gone, and that he had con&s;ign|ed her to perpetual impri&s;onment, &s;he re&s;ted per&s;uaded that her ca&s;e was as hopele&s;s as it was mi&s;erable</P>
<P>But even under this overwhelming conviction, Ellen did not for&s;ake her&s;elf. She need<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d not Sir William's exhortations to &s;hun all exce&s;&s;es in her grief, and every undue and unbecoming

violence. Stunned rather than rou&s;ed, afflicted rather than irritated, the fir&s;t recollection of her real &s;ituation, which was &s;ufficiently perfect t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> form any re&s;olution upon, was followed by a determination to do nothing which could be injuri|ous to her child, or di&s;agreeable to her&s;elf. But it was not on her own &s;trength that &s;he relied for power to bear up under &s;uch a load of hopele&s;s mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The woman who had remained an attentive but forgotten &s;pectator of all her movements, &s;aw her with &s;urpri&s;e ri&s;e from her chair, with an air of dignified humility, and pro&s;trating her&s;elf up|on her knees, continue for &s;ome moments in fervent prayer.</P>
<P>When &s;he aro&s;e, &s;he ca&s;t her eyes upon the woman, and appeared to &s;ee her for the fir&s;t time. She advanced towards her; and with a mild and complacent a&s;pect held out her hand towards her; &s;eeming by this action to be&s;peak her friend|&s;hip, and to declare her own &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The woman, &s;truck and moved by her manner and look, could not forbear rai&s;ing the hand that was offered her to her lips, and then immediate|ly pre&s;ented her with &s;ome of her cloths, endea|voured to make her under&s;tand, how ready &s;he &s;hould be to &s;erve her. From this moment, it it &s;eemed as if a treaty of amity was &s;ealed be|tween them: and Ellen felt &s;omething like hope revive in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>When Ellen was dre&s;&s;ed, her attendant opened the door of a room which was oppo&s;ite to the one that led to the bed chamber; and invited Ellen to enter it. Ellen found this room much larger than either the dre&s;&s;ing-room or bed-cham|ber;
<PB N="110" REF="036127_0322_100851FCD84C4A88">
and ca&s;ting her eyes round it, &s;aw in the manner in which it was furni&s;hed, a &s;ad certain|ty of the intended length of her captivity.</P>
<P>Two book-ca&s;es, which, with the books they contained, &s;eemed to be new, and recently put up, filled the large rece&s;&s;es on each &s;ide of the fire. A harp&s;ichord, which al&s;o appeared to be new, &s;tood on the one &s;ide of the room: near it was placed a harp. A writing table, furni&s;h|ed with all the materials nece&s;&s;ary for writing, &s;tood near the fire. A &s;ofa, and one or two chairs, of different forms and dimen&s;ions, with two more tables, made up the furniture. The room was fitted up with &s;triped linen: and there &s;eemed diffu&s;ed over the whole an air of cheerfulne&s;s which &s;uited ill with the &s;ad|ne&s;s of Ellen's &s;oul. Hitherto &s;he had not &s;hed a tear. On beholding an apartment &s;o evi|dently prepared for her &s;olitary pri&s;on, &s;he bur&s;t into a pa&s;&s;ion of weeping, and threw her&s;elf on the &s;ofa, in an agony of mind not to be de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The calmne&s;s which &s;he had hitherto pre&s;erv|ed, aro&s;e more from the &s;tunning nature of the blow &s;he had received, and the natural temper and acquired habits of her mind, than from any fortitude that &s;he had yet been able to a&s;&s;ume upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Suddenly and irre|&s;i&s;tably the recollection of Engli&s;h friends and Engli&s;h joys ru&s;hed upon her heart, and the &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;ery in the lo&s;s of her, and of her's in the lo&s;s of them, formed a mingled torture of &s;o acute a kind, as for a time overcame all her &s;en&s;e of the duty of re&s;ignation, and all her fears for the &s;afety of her child. Agitated by convul&s;ive twitchings, almo&s;t choaked by her
<PB N="111" REF="036127_0323_100851FFDB129E48">
ri&s;ing &s;obs, &s;he lay for &s;ome in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t alarming di&s;order.</P>
<P>Her new friend, not more terrified than griev|ed for the &s;ituation in which &s;he &s;aw her, ming|led &s;o much genuine compa&s;&s;ion in her attempts to relieve and calm her, that Ellen, upon whom the voice of kindne&s;s was never lo&s;t, and whom death alone could hold long in&s;en&s;ible to the emotions of gratitude, began, in pity to what another felt, to &s;till the loud complainings of her own affliction.</P>
<P>She became compo&s;ed and &s;ilent; patiently took what was offered her; and returning after &s;ome interval to perfect calmne&s;s, &s;he &s;hewed &s;o earne&s;t a de&s;ire to be left alone, that the com|pa&s;&s;ionate Mrs. Ulric at length complied.</P>
<P>Ellen, left to her&s;elf, wept without re&s;traint and without mea&s;ure: and this free indulgence of nature &s;aved her overcharged heart from breaking. Her mind glanced hopefully on the compa&s;&s;ion which &s;he &s;aw &s;he had excited in her attendant: and &s;he began to believe it would not be difficult to win her over to her wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed but to be able to write to Sir William, &s;ecure, could &s;he once induce him to come to an explanation, that &s;he mu&s;t convince him of her innocence. The rigour of his deal|ings towards her was all founded on error: and hence, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of his letter which had at fir&s;t given her the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s, now in&s;pired her with hope. Were I the vic|tim of his hatred, (thought Ellen) no ju&s;tificati|on would avail me. But while I am a &s;ufferer only from his mi&s;taken ideas of ju&s;tice, in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing my innocence, I &s;hall put an end to my
<PB N="112" REF="036127_0324_100852016392CFC0">
misfortunes. It &s;eemed &s;o ea&s;y to prove this innocence to any one with whom &s;he could &s;peak, that the mo&s;t bitter of her regrets at this moment, was her incapacity to conver&s;e with Mrs. Ulric.</P>
<P>This tender hearted woman returned in a few hours to Ellen's apartment, bringing with her a nicely prepared meal, of which &s;he pre&s;&s;ed Ellen with &s;o much kindne&s;s to partake, that &s;he could not wholly refu&s;e her. But Ellen could not eat. Mrs. Ulric, however, induced her to drink a gla&s;s of wine, and again left her to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The clo&s;e of this melancholy day now came on: and from tho&s;e changes to which the mind in the fir&s;t &s;tages of affliction is &s;ubject, grief &s;eemed to return with fre&s;h force, as the &s;hades of evening over&s;pread the apartment; nor was her grief wholly unmixed with a degree of ter|ror. Frightful images aro&s;e in her mind: and &s;he &s;carcely dared to tru&s;t her&s;elf with con&s;ider|ing, to what &s;o violent means as tho&s;e already taken by Sir William might ultimately lead. But the&s;e unfounded fears aro&s;e wholly from the &s;hattered &s;tate of her nerves. The benevolent countenance of Mrs. Ulric, illuminated by the light of two candles, with which &s;he pre&s;ently entered the room, di&s;&s;ipated them in an in&s;tant: and Ellen ea&s;ily admitted the folly of tormenting her&s;elf with imaginary evils, when &s;he had &s;o many real ones to deplore.</P>
<P>The fatigues which Ellen had undergone for three days, had entirely exhau&s;ted her &s;trength: and &s;he readily yielded to the &s;igns by which &s;he under&s;tood Mrs. Ulric to de&s;ire her to go to
<PB N="113" REF="036127_0325_100852046D24BF58">
bed. When there, wearine&s;s &s;o overcame afflic|tion, that if &s;he found no refre&s;hment, &s;he at lea&s;t received re&s;t. Her mind was &s;o full of her project of making Mrs. Ulric her friend, that, in &s;tudying for means to explain her&s;elf to her, &s;he lo&s;t a part of the &s;en&s;e of what made &s;uch an explanation de&s;irable, She was re&s;olved, al&s;o, to endeavour the next morning to in&s;pect every part of her pri&s;on, both as a matter of curio&s;ity, and as a means to a&s;certain what degree of in|dulgence would be allowed her.</P>
<P>Her &s;leep as it was broken, &s;o it was &s;hort. She aro&s;e early, and looking for her watch, now re|collected, for the fir&s;t time, by what artifice Sir William had deprived her of it. She ea&s;ily comprehended his rea&s;on for &s;uch a procedure; and was not therefore &s;urpri&s;ed upon feeling in her pockets to find her pur&s;e gone, and every trinket, of however trifling a value, except the picture of her father, which was &s;et very plainly in gold.</P>
<P>On the &s;ight of a countenance, which never bent its regard towards her but with looks of the fonde&s;t love, now never more to be beheld by her, her whole frame &s;hook with di&s;order, and her heart &s;welled almo&s;t to bur&s;ting.</P>
<P>'My father,' cried &s;he, and pre&s;&s;ed the picture to her lips. 'My father!' repeated &s;he, 'Now in vain do I call to you for help; now, in my uttermo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, impotent to &s;ave?'</P>
<P>De&s;pair &s;topt her tongue.</P>
<P>'Oh! God,' cried &s;he, kneeling down, 'be thou my father. Thou can&s;t bur&s;t the walls of this pri&s;on. Thou can&s;t re&s;tore me to all I hold dear&mdash;to reputation, to friend&s;hip, to happine&s;s.

Thou can&s;t do more: thou can&s;t teach me to endure with patience, perpetual impri&s;onment, never-ending deprivation. Let it be as thou wilt.'</P>
<P>This act of pious re&s;ignation calmed the flur|ried pa&s;&s;ions of Ellen. Again &s;he pre&s;&s;ed her father's picture to her lips; and felt an emotion of gratitude to Sir William for having left her &s;o precious a relique.</P>

<P>WHEN Mrs. Ulric attended, &s;he found Ellen dre&s;&s;ed, and apparently perfectly compo&s;ed. Mrs. Ulric withdrew with intention of preparing break|fa&s;t: and Ellen took an accurate &s;urvey of her apartments. She found, in addition to the three rooms &s;he had &s;een, two clo&s;ets which belonged to her bed chamber, one dark and the other light. The windows of her bed chamber and dre&s;&s;ing-room were both too high to allow of any thing being &s;een from thence, except when &s;tanding clo&s;e to them. She &s;aw, they looked upon a garden, which, as far as &s;he could di&s;|cern, was walled round. Beyond it &s;he could &s;ee only woods, which appeared to extend far into the country. The windows of the apart|ment, which &s;eemed to be allotted for her fitting-room, were lower than tho&s;e in the other rooms; and appeared to have been newly put in. They opened into the court-yard by which &s;he had entered: and as the window of the light clo&s;et looked out upon the open country, Ellen com|prehended that her apartment occupied one entire &s;ide of the building. The window of this clo&s;et
<PB N="116" REF="036127_0328_1008520FE36C4878">
was too high to look from, except when &s;tand|ing upon a chair, or table; and was &s;o &s;mall, that Ellen could not have got her head through it. The country which could be &s;een from it, appeared wild and de&s;olate.</P>
<P>Ellen felt it a matter of great importance to her&s;elf, whether &s;he &s;hould be allowed the liberty to pa&s;s beyond this apartment, or whether it was indeed the limits of her confinement. She was re&s;olved to know.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Ulric, who had attended her at breakfa&s;t, was removing the tea equipage, Ellen aro&s;e, and went towards the door of her apart|ment. Mrs. Ulric in&s;tantly put down what &s;he had in her hand, opened the door of the room, and &s;eemed to invite Ellen to enter the gallery. Ellen complied: and Mrs. Ulric going before her, &s;hewed the rooms which were oppo&s;ite tho&s;e &s;he inhabited. Some of the&s;e appeared to be occupied by &s;ervants, and &s;ome not to be occu|pied at all: and Ellen thought &s;he under&s;tood that one belonged to Mrs. Ulric. The furniture was &s;canty, and mi&s;erably old, and ill corre&s;|ponded with that which &s;he had &s;een in her own apartment.</P>
<P>From the gallery &s;he de&s;cended to the hall, and the fir&s;t object which caught her eye, was, the door by which &s;he had entered it through the long pa&s;&s;age that led to the outer court. This was now clo&s;ed, and fa&s;tened by a heavy wooden bar, which was placed acro&s;s it. She went into the parlour, where &s;he had been re|ceived the night of her arrival. It was gloomy: and by &s;everal things that lay about, &s;he con|cluded it was the place where Mrs. Ulric u&s;ually
<PB N="117" REF="036127_0329_100852116DC41850">
&s;at. The remembrance how &s;he had been be|trayed into her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, ru&s;hed power|fully on her mind: and &s;he ha&s;tily quitted a place which called to her recollection circum&s;tances &s;he could not bear to think of.</P>
<P>Returning to the hall, &s;he made towards a door, which &s;he then fir&s;t perceived. Mrs. Ulric &s;tepping before, &s;hewed her it opened into the offices, but directed her attention to one oppo&s;ite. She opened that too, and Ellen found, with great &s;atisfaction that it led immediately to the garden. Mrs. Ulric, as if yielding to the de&s;ire which Ellen &s;hewed to enter it, made way; and, re&s;pectfully retiring, &s;uffered Ellen to walk out alone.</P>
<P>Her heart bounded, when &s;he found &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch a privilege; and &s;he felt her|&s;elf half at liberty. She traver&s;ed the gardens with a kind of wild tumultuous hope of imme|diate e&s;cape. But &s;he was &s;oon convinced of what indeed her rea&s;on, if this had been a mo|ment when rea&s;on could have been attended to, would have told her before, that every avenue was &s;ecurely clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The garden was &s;pacious; and &s;eemed to be laid out more for u&s;e than plea&s;ure. Yet at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, there were &s;ome retired and &s;hady places, which would afford no unplea&s;ant retreat, in &s;uch weather as makes the cooler air preferable to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Many parts of the walls were old: and it appeared as if the new building which connect|ed them together, did not follow the line of any former wall which might have been de&s;troyed. From this circum&s;tance, Ellen concluded, that
<PB N="118" REF="036127_0330_10085212F6D86BA8">
the compa&s;s of the garden had been le&s;&s;ened; at one &s;harp angle, however, the meeting lines of which were formed of walls equally old, &s;he di&s;covered a &s;mall door: it was very ma&s;&s;ive, and, though extremely old, retained great &s;trength: upon it was a lock; but as the fa&s;tening of the door did not &s;eem to depend upon that. Ellen tried to &s;hake it, but found it perfectly &s;teady. As well as &s;he could judge from its po&s;ition, it mu&s;t open immediately upon the country: and poor Ellen &s;tood for &s;ome minutes oppo&s;ite to it, fixed in a deep and melancholy reverie, &s;o lo&s;t in thought, that &s;he knew not that it was the hope of e&s;cape through that door, that wholly ab&s;orbed her faculties.</P>
<P>Starting from this temporary &s;tupor, &s;he con|tinued her &s;earch. But finding no other &s;pot in the whole circumference of the garden, from which it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould e&s;cape, &s;he re|turned again to the door; again &s;urveyed it with the greate&s;t accuracy; again tried to &s;hake it upon its hinges; and again found all her efforts ineffectual.</P>
<P>It was impul&s;e rather than rea&s;on (as the new-caught bird flutters around its cage) that had occa&s;ioned Ellen to make this &s;earch. Had it been attended with the di&s;covery of an immediate means of e&s;cape, Ellen was in no condition to have availed her&s;elf of it; and mu&s;t have declined, upon reflection, to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, which made walk|ing any di&s;tance impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;her total want of money&mdash;her entire ignorance of the language of the country&mdash;would have made it madne&s;s to have attempted an e&s;cape, while there remained
<PB N="119" REF="036127_0331_1008521625D009D8">
any hope of inducing Sir William to do her ju&s;tice. On winning Mrs. Ulric to her cau&s;e, &s;he re&s;ted all her real hopes and rational expec|tations of deliverance: and &s;he determined not to lo&s;e a moment in making the experiment.</P>
<P>Being returned to her apartment, &s;he &s;at down with the de&s;ign of forming that letter, which &s;he hoped to be able to prevail upon Mrs. Ulric to deliver. But, upon reperu&s;ing Sir William's, to determine upon the be&s;t manner in which to enter upon her defence, &s;he found her&s;elf entire|ly at a lo&s;s. The circum&s;tances on which he grounded her condemnation, were entirely un|known to her: and the conviction under which he &s;eemed to write, that &s;he mu&s;t her&s;elf acknow|ledge her guilt, as it took away every uncertainty upon which explanation could be founded, &s;o it appeared to make all explanation impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But when &s;he attended to the preci&s;e act of criminality with which &s;he was charged, in the words, 'I was appri&s;ed, by the evidence of my own &s;en&s;es, of the la&s;t vi&s;it you received from your undoer,' a &s;u&s;picion found place in her mind which had not before entered it.</P>
<P>Ellen had never &s;een Henry, (for that he was meant by her undoer, &s;he had no doubt) &s;ince they parted in Devon&s;hire. He had attended her to her carriage, at the hour of her departure, and he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted her into it, in the pre&s;ence of Sir William, of &s;everal &s;ervants, and of ma|ny other people. This attendance could hardly be called a vi&s;it; and if it could, it was not po&s;&s;ible to fix the &s;tain of guilt upon it; nor could it be nece&s;&s;ary that Sir William &s;hould appri&s;e her, as a piece of of information which
<PB N="120" REF="036127_0332_1008521BCAFCF918">
mu&s;t overwhelm her with &s;hame and confu&s;ion, that he had witne&s;&s;ed it. This &s;he knew well: and &s;he could neither have had the power, nor a motive to conceal it. But as &s;he was perfectly convinced that no &s;ub&s;equent interview had taken place between them, and as, from the circum|&s;tance of her having withdrawn into the coun|try, before Mr. Villars arrived in town, &s;he thought Sir William mu&s;t be as well convinced of this as her&s;elf: &s;he began to &s;u&s;pect that Sir William, &s;o far from being deceived, &s;ought only to deceive her&mdash;that, delivered up to his re&s;entment, on being per&s;uaded, that he &s;hould never be able to touch her heart, he had re&s;olved to puni&s;h that as a crime in her, which he felt to be &s;o &s;evere a misfortune to him&s;elf. His &s;aying, that he had &s;een that which &s;he was entirely clear in her own mind he never could have &s;een, confirmed this idea; and made her conclude that he only &s;ought to colour an act of extreme cruelty and revenge, with the thin veil of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas filled her with de&s;pair. She had placed her hopes of redre&s;s upon the belief, that her ju&s;tification would be as acceptable to Sir William as advantageous to her&s;elf. But now &s;he began to think, that her greate&s;t difficulty would not be in prevailing upon Mrs. Ulric to deliver her letter, but in inducing Sir William to give it a candid reading. His prohibition to write to him&mdash;his declaration that he wi&s;hed only for forgetfulne&s;s&mdash;his acknowledgment, that the voice of penitance would plead in vain&mdash;all concurred to make it evident, that he wi&s;hed not to have her innocence e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="036127_0333_1008521D6EC82688">'It is hatred and revenge which have placed me here,' &s;aid &s;he, the tears running down her cheeks: 'and it would be in vain to hope for my deliverance from tenderne&s;s and love.'</P>
<P>Her thoughts ha&s;tily returned to the garden. Again &s;he recon&s;idered the walls of it. Their height, their &s;olidity, precluded every hope of e&s;cape that way. Her own helple&s;s &s;tate, even could &s;he get out, now al&s;o ru&s;hed upon her mind. To owe her deliverance to her own pow|ers, &s;he felt was impo&s;&s;ible. And as &s;he would not neglect any po&s;&s;ible chance of putting an end to her &s;orrows, &s;he finally re&s;olved, not with&s;tanding her hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of its &s;ucce&s;s, to try the effect of a letter to Sir William&mdash;Thus &s;he wrote.</P>
<P>'I addre&s;s you not as a penitent, not as an object of your love, I appeal only to your ju&s;|tice. I am innocent. Never, even in thought, have I wandered from the duty that I owe you. Of this you will &s;ome time be convinced. If, therefore, you have any con&s;ideration for the fu|ture peace of your mind, wait not for this con|viction, until my injuries are pa&s;t redre&s;s.</P>
<P>'I be&s;eech you, let me under&s;tand the par|ticulars of my accu&s;ation, that I may be able to clear my&s;elf even from &s;u&s;picion. To the pre|&s;ent unintelligible charge which you bring again&s;t me, I can only repeat, that I am innocent. If you will conde&s;cend to explain your&s;elf to me, I can prove my&s;elf &s;o. I know of no vi&s;it, I am con&s;cious of no invitation, which can fix the &s;lighte&s;t &s;tigma upon my name, of none which I would not avow in the face of the whole world. I cannot comprehend what you mean. I &s;up|pre&s;s,

however, all complaint. I am willing to believe you have acted upon a mi&s;take: and if you will only permit me to &s;ee and to conver&s;e with you, I am confident I &s;hall lo&s;e at once all cau&s;e and all inclination to complain.'</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed this letter, &s;he re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ail Mrs. Ulric with all her powers, when next &s;he &s;aw her. Nor was the opportunity long wanting. This compa&s;&s;ionate woman, who&s;e heart was ill &s;uited to the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned her, was not able to ab&s;ent her&s;elf long from her unfortunate pri&s;oner, le&s;t &s;ome con&s;olation might be wanting which &s;he could afford. She enter|ed the room, bringing with her &s;ome bi&s;cuits and a cup of chocolate; for Ellen, with all her efforts, had not been able to &s;wallow a mor&s;el at breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Ellen took the refre&s;hment which was offered her with a &s;mile: put a part of one of the bi&s;|cuits in her mouth: and ta&s;ted the chocolate. But &s;he could do no more. Her heart &s;welled: and tears ran down her cheeks. Mrs. Ulric looked on her with compa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ought to &s;oothe her.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;eized her hand; and pre&s;&s;ing it fervent|ly to her lips, 'Oh! if you could be induced to a&s;&s;i&s;t me!' &s;aid &s;he. The tone of the&s;e words &s;eemed to penetrate the heart of Mrs. Ulric. She too wept. The moment &s;eemed favourable: and Ellen, holding out the letter to her, looked in her face with a countenance of entreaty that could not be mi&s;under&s;tood. It was perfectly intelligible to Mrs. Ulric: But &s;he put the letter back with her hand; and &s;hook her head in token of refu&s;al.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="036127_0335_100852238979EF10">'Let me prevail,' &s;aid Ellen, joining her hands together.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulric withdrew a few &s;teps.</P>
<P>'I have no hope if you deny me,' &s;aid Ellen; and threw her&s;elf on her knees before her.</P>
<P>Greatly moved, Mrs. Ulric &s;tooped ha&s;tily to rai&s;e her.</P>
<P>Again Ellen offered her the letter: but Mrs. Ulric withdrew her hand, and walked toward the door.</P>
<P>'Have you no pity?' &s;aid Ellen.</P>
<P>The moving tones of her voice &s;eemed to &s;ubdue Mrs. Ulric. She returned&mdash;&s;he rai&s;ed Ellen to the &s;ofa. She took the letter; but open|ing the drawer of the writing-table, &s;he depo&s;ited the letter there, locked the drawer, and gave Ellen the key.</P>
<P>The calm deci&s;ion of this action robbed Ellen of every hope. She &s;at for &s;ome moments a motionle&s;s image of de&s;pair. The blood for&s;ook her lips; and &s;he &s;carcely breathed. Mrs. Ulric approached her. She kneeled down before her. She took her hand; and re&s;pectfully ki&s;&s;ed it: She &s;eemed to &s;ay, 'Unhappy that I am not to be able to do as you wi&s;h me.'</P>
<P>Ellen was not in&s;en&s;ible, even to this degree of kindne&s;s. 'Cruel Sir William!' exclaimed &s;he, 'had you but allowed me to have been un|der&s;tood, how ea&s;ily &s;hould I have worked upon this worthy woman to have befriended me! But you have indeed taken your mea&s;ures &s;ecurely. You have indeed known how to make my ruin complete.'</P>

re&s;olved to make one more effort to prevail on her to receive her letter.

<P>MRS. ULRIC had not the &s;hadow of a doubt of Ellen's guilt. Sir William had made it clear to her, by a detail of circum&s;tances, which &s;eemed to admit but of one explanation. His own di&s;tre&s;s, the tender con&s;ideration, which, even in preparing the puni&s;hment, he had ma|nife&s;ted for every po&s;&s;ible con&s;olation to be ad|mini&s;tered to Ellen, not incompatible with that puni&s;hment, had convinced Mrs. Ulric of the &s;incerity of his love, and the bitterne&s;s of his re|gret, for the mea&s;ures that he thought him&s;elf obliged to pur&s;ue. The&s;e circum&s;tances, joined with the agonies &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed in him, when the moment at la&s;t came of delivering Ellen into her hands, left her not a &s;u&s;picion, but certainty, that Ellen being no longer de&s;erving of his love, could be alone his motive for withdrawing it.</P>
<P>The&s;e were two points in which Sir William knowingly deceived Mrs. Ulric. He had repre|&s;ented to her, that even in the puni&s;hment to which he had doomed Ellen, he had been ac|tuated
<PB N="126" REF="036127_0338_1008522E03F156A0">
by motives of mercy; that a much &s;everer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate awaited her from the cu&s;toms of her own country, and from the indignation of her parents; and that if he were to deliver her to them, not only impri&s;onment would be her lot, but an im|pri&s;onment of a much more rigorous kind, aggra|vated by darkne&s;s, fa&s;ting, and &s;tripes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulric therefore con&s;idered Sir William not only as one of the mo&s;t injured and unfortu|nate of men, but as one of the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate and worthy. This deceit had been &s;ugge&s;ted from a knowledge of Mrs. Ulric's character, who would never have con&s;ented to become an in&s;tru|ment of &s;o much inju&s;tice as was attached to Sir William's conduct, even in the ca&s;e of Ellen's actual guilt. But, acting under the error into which &s;he had been betrayed, although the mild and winning manners of Ellen, with the graces of her per&s;on, and the mi&s;ery of her &s;ituation, made the heart of Mrs. Ulric overflow with the &s;ofte&s;t compa&s;&s;ion; yet did &s;he not look upon her as pu|ni&s;hed more than her crimes de&s;erved, or feel in|clined to do aught toward re&s;toring her to the con|fidence of a hu&s;band, whom &s;he believed &s;he had &s;o grievou&s;ly injured.</P>
<P>In another particular, al&s;o, Sir William had mi&s;led Mrs. Ulric, and from &s;omething of a &s;i|milar motive, wi&s;hing by accumulated proofs of Ellen's guilt, to take away the po&s;&s;ibility at any future moment of her being able to fix any blame upon him in the mind of a per&s;on on who&s;e fi|delity he was, after all his precautions, obliged to depend for the final accompli&s;hment of his purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>He had therefore &s;ignified to Mrs. Ulric, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the child of which Ellen was then big, was the
<PB N="127" REF="036127_0339_1008522F8BAF2E30">
offspring of that guilty love, which &s;he was now to expiate by perpetual impri&s;onment. It there|fore happened, that Mrs. Ulric never looked upon Ellen, but &s;he thought &s;he &s;aw an irrefragable proof of her crime. And every effort Ellen made to prove her innocence, Mrs. Ulric con&s;idered only as attempts either to move compa&s;&s;ion, or as &s;hews of penitence.</P>
<P>This Mrs. Ulric had, indeed, been the per&s;onal &s;ervant of the Bohemian lady, whom Sir William repre&s;ented her to Ellen as having &s;erved. But this lady was now dead; nor had &s;he inhabited the hou&s;e where Ellen now was for many years before her death. It belonged to the nobleman her &s;on, an intimate friend of Sir William, and, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, his only confidant. To him &s;ir William had communicated fir&s;t his &s;u&s;picions of Ellen's infidelity, and afterwards his certainty of it: and by him had been &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of the nature of the puni&s;hment to be inflicted. He had pointed out the eligibility of this decayed and &s;olitary man&s;ion for the purpo&s;es of a pri&s;on: and he had repre&s;ented, that, in the tried faith and gentle manners of Mrs. Ulric, he would find &s;uch a jailore&s;s as he de&s;ired. All he had to do was to convince her of the ju&s;tice and mercy of the plan propo&s;ed, and he might rely upon her integrity without a fear. She was, when &s;ir William's friend recommended her to him, entirely dependant upon and &s;upported by his bounty: and &s;he would willingly under|take any charge with which he would intru&s;t her that did not militate again&s;t her ideas of rectitude.</P>
<P>Sir William had re&s;olved, in con&s;equence of what he believed he had a&s;certained, during his vi&s;it in Devon&s;hire, to have removed Ellen ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad
<PB N="128" REF="036127_0340_100852329AAD1230">
immediately after &s;he was &s;ufficiently recovered from her lying-in to bear &s;uch a journey.</P>
<P>But Ellen's conduct in her requi&s;ition to leave town, &s;o &s;eemingly the re&s;ult of the pure&s;t inte|grity, had &s;taggered Sir William's firm belief in her guilt; and had determined him to make one experiment as to what her re&s;idence in the country would produce. He had been perfectly per|&s;uaded, that the child was not his; and hence his evident di&s;like to him when alive, and the &s;atisfac|tion he had &s;uffered to e&s;cape him, on his death. But there had been &s;uch an unju&s;tifiable brutality in his expre&s;&s;ion on that occa&s;ion, and the effect it had on Ellen was &s;o grievous, that there was no|thing he would not have done, to have effaced the impre&s;&s;ion it had made.</P>
<P>The placability of Ellen's temper had &s;oftened his heart. He began to believe, he had been mi&s;led by an unfounded jealou&s;y. He began to hope, that mutual love might &s;pring up between them: and he had nearly forgotten all his &s;chemes of revenge and cha&s;ti&s;ement, when the accidental di&s;covery of Henry e&s;caping over the hedge of the garden, drove from his mind all doubt of the guilt, and all moderation in the puni&s;hment of it.</P>
<P>From this moment, his whole thoughts were turned to concealing and perfecting the de&s;igns, which he was now re&s;olute to pro&s;ecute to the utmo&s;t: and to this purpo&s;e might be referred every thing that he had done, from the moment in which he announced to Ellen his intentions of quitting Eng|land, to that in which he had followed her with his eyes for the la&s;t time.</P>
<P>Often, indeed, had the force of his emotions been too &s;trong for his hypocri&s;y. But Ellen hav|ing no clue to guide her &s;u&s;picions aright, he had
<PB N="129" REF="036127_0341_100852360D31DE60">
e&s;caped detection. She had con&s;idered what was indeed the breaking forth of his future de&s;ign, but as the remains of a jealou&s;y with which &s;he was but too well acquainted, and for which &s;he &s;ometimes hoped a cure from time and the unde+viating prudence of her own conduct; and for which, at others, &s;he was &s;adly per&s;uaded there was no cure po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Often had the fair and candid &s;oul of Ellen, which appeared in her every action, made him mi&s;tru&s;t what he thought was the evidence of his own &s;en&s;es. But the conviction that he owed his pre&s;ent per&s;ua&s;ion only to &s;uch evidence di&s;|pelled every doubt, and &s;o fully &s;ettled his belief of the fal&s;hood of Ellen, that he could as &s;oon have called in que&s;tion his own exi&s;tence as her guilt.</P>
<P>Having communicated his final re&s;olves to his friend, many &s;teps preparatory to the execution of his plan, had been taken before his arrival in Saxony: and Ellen's impri&s;onment was to have commenced with the winter. But when Sir Wil|liam unexpectedly found her with child, at a time when he could not doubt but that the child was his, his former de&s;ire for an heir to his e&s;tate, which had &s;o large a &s;hare in his determination to marry, returned with fre&s;h force to his mind. But to give a public legitimacy to the infant that Ellen would bring, it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould be known to have been with child; nor mu&s;t the date of her pretended death take place &s;o early as to make it impo&s;&s;ible that the child, who was &s;ometime to be produced, could be hers.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations prolonged to Ellen the term of her liberty. But though the circum&s;tances
<PB N="130" REF="036127_0342_10085237A836E818">
of her pregnancy might delay the time of her being &s;hut up, it would in the end facilitate the plan. It was only by a feigned tale of her death, that he could hope to put a &s;top to the enquiries of her Engli&s;h friends: and there was no incident upon which he could found &s;uch a tale with equal appearance of probability, as one &s;o frequently attended by the mo&s;t &s;udden and fatal cata&s;trophe. The dangerous &s;tate to which Ellen had been re|duced in her fir&s;t lying-in, would contribute to e&s;tabli&s;h the credit of the pretended event of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>It was therefore &s;ettled between Sir William and his friend, that &s;he &s;hould remain at Dre&s;den until within three months of the expected time of her lying-in; that Sir William &s;hould then remove to the Saxon village, that he might be &s;ufficiently near the place of her intended confinement, to &s;atisfy him&s;elf, that every preparation nece&s;&s;ary for it was executed to his wi&s;hes. And it was agreed, that when &s;he was within a very &s;hort period of the time of her being to be brought to bed, &s;he &s;hould, under pretence of beginning her journey to Vienna, be conducted thither.</P>
<P>The tale that Sir William meant to tell, was, that, being &s;eized unexpectedly with the pains of labour, at an ob&s;cure inn on the road to Vienna, &s;he had there expired.</P>
<P>Sir William had &s;ome fears, that the agitation and grief which Ellen would unavoidably undergo, when &s;he found the heavy de&s;tiny that awaited her through the re&s;t of her life, might prove pre|judicial to the &s;afety of the child. But he had al&s;o almo&s;t equal hopes that the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this circum&s;tance might operate to imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> greater degree of patience, than &s;he would other|wi&s;e
<PB N="231" REF="036127_0343_1008523BC40C50E0">
be able to a&s;&s;ume. And the&s;e hopes, which were founded upon the excellence of Ellen's cha|racter, were not vain.</P>
<P>It was Sir William's intention to linger near the &s;pot of Ellen's confinement, until &s;he was brought to bed; and when he was informed of the con&s;e|quences of that event, then to di&s;mi&s;s her from his &s;olicitude for ever, and make all the advance he could in the road to forgetfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>That no circum&s;tance might hereafter obtrude Ellen upon his memory, he gave his friend on who&s;e integrity he had a perfect reliance, power to draw upon him for any &s;um nece&s;&s;ary to defray the expen&s;es of her e&s;tabli&s;hment: and he ap|pointed an agent at Dre&s;den, who was to be paid by the Bohemian nobleman, to furni&s;h every thing that Ellen might require. To authenticate her requi&s;itions, which he had &s;ignified to her were to be written in French, nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary than the &s;ignature of Mrs. Ulric.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulric had, therefore, no immediate in|tercour&s;e with Sir William: and had &s;he been inclined to have favoured Ellen's cau&s;e, &s;he would not only have had Sir William's re&s;entment to have overcome, but the reluctance of her late ma&s;ter, who, &s;he knew, concurred in all that Sir William had done; and applauded the ju&s;tice and mercy of his proceedings.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulric had been directed to inform Sir William, through the channel of this nobleman, how Ellen bore the fir&s;t &s;hock of her misfortune. And however favourable this report might be, it was very unlikely that the friend of Sir William &s;hould take any &s;tep towards reconciling him to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of who&s;e guilt he was perfectly &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulric had made a faithful repre&s;entation of
<PB N="132" REF="036127_0344_1008523D4C993070">
Ellen's mildne&s;s, moderation, and patience. But imputing the whole to penitence, &s;he led both Sir William and his friend to believe, that Ellen had been &s;ufficiently explicit in the marks of this con|trition, to furni&s;h, if that had been nece&s;&s;ary, fre&s;h proofs of her former guilt. Sir William, therefore, however mi&s;erable, was far from re|penting the &s;tep he had taken. He had truly &s;aid, "I am deaf to the voice of penitence." To for|give was not in his nature: and nothing but the conviction of Ellen's innocence would have in|duced him to have re&s;tored her to liberty: and from this conviction he was farther removed than ever.</P>

<P>WHEN Ellen found all the hopes &s;he had en|tertained vain, of being able to move Mrs. Ulric in her favour, &s;he began to turn her thoughts upon &s;ome other individual, who might probably make a part of the hou&s;ehold.</P>
<P>She had hitherto &s;een only one other per&s;on; and &s;he &s;oon found that the hou&s;e contained no more. This was a hale, &s;tout country girl, with an open good humoured countenance: and though the being totally without the means of applying to the intere&s;ted feelings of &s;uch a one was an ob|&s;tacle to her &s;ucce&s;s, in circum&s;tances which ad|mitted of any other hope, Ellen would have con|&s;idered as invincible, hers was not a &s;ituation, where even great difficulties ought to di&s;courage her: and &s;he re&s;olved to make the attempt. She hoped, by the courteou&s;ne&s;s of her manners, to conciliate the girl's good will: and &s;he &s;ometimes flattered her&s;elf, that precaution had not been &s;o unremittingly awake as to have extended to an ig|norant girl, whom it was known &s;he could not bribe, the prohibition as to receiving any letter
<PB N="134" REF="036127_0346_100852458605FA18">
from her hands. She had no doubt that &s;he, like Mrs. Ulric, &s;poke only German; and had there|fore no hope of moving her by argument.</P>
<P>By having attended clo&s;ely to the words which Mrs. Ulric always u&s;ed to her&s;elf when &s;he &s;ought to induce her to any compliance, &s;he thought her|&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of one phra&s;e of entreaty in a lan|guage that would be under&s;tood: and armed with this piece of rhetoric, and a letter in her hand, &s;he one day acco&s;ted the dam&s;el. But what was her a&s;toni&s;hment, when, with a broad &s;tare of incomprehen&s;ion, &s;he was an&s;wered in &s;ounds more uncouth and unintelligible than had ever before met her ears.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;hrunk back: and hope died within her, when &s;he found this fre&s;h impediment to the &s;uc|ce&s;s of her plans: for &s;he ea&s;ily comprehended, that the girl was a true-born Bohemian, and &s;poke only her native Sclavonian.</P>
<P>The many plans which Ellen had laid to gain the attention of this girl, and the various &s;chemes which &s;he had adopted and rejected as likely means, or as being impo&s;&s;ible to engage her compa&s;&s;ion, and explain her own wi&s;hes to her, had &s;o fully occupied her mind for &s;ome days, that &s;he had had le&s;s lei&s;ure to reflect upon her actual &s;ituation. In the hopes of liberty, &s;he lo&s;t, for a time, a &s;en&s;e of her re&s;traint: and when, by the di&s;covery of the impo&s;&s;ibility of making the girl comprehend her, the&s;e hopes &s;eemed to &s;hrink to nothing, a new, and even a more lively intere&s;t prevented her from feeling the whole weight of her di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P>She had received tho&s;e preparations for her approaching indi&s;po&s;ition which Sir William had promi&s;ed her in his letter: and &s;he bu&s;ied her&s;elf
<PB N="135" REF="036127_0347_100852470D970100">
in arranging every thing relative to that period This &s;ubject being fully in her mind, &s;he naturally reverted to the ray of hope which Sir William him&s;elf &s;eemed to allow the birth of a child af|forded her. She endeavoured to di&s;cover the true meaning of the words he had u&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was evident, that he was per&s;uaded the child was his own: and under this per&s;ua&s;ion it was but too likely he would not &s;uffer it to remain in her care. In the ca&s;e of its being removed from her, what hope could &s;pring from its exi&s;tence, to gild her future life?&mdash;When Sir William had once announced her death to her friends (and by a &s;tory of her death, &s;he naturally concluded, he could alone conceal her impri&s;onment) he had put it out of his own power, without fixing an inde|lible reproach upon him&s;elf, to re&s;tore her to the world: and however probable &s;he might think it, that he would defer &s;uch an annunciation, till after the expected period of her lying-in, which was well known to her Engli&s;h friends, as a &s;ecu|rity again&s;t any doubts of the legitimacy of the child he might produce, yet &s;he felt it nearly impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould delay it longer. What good, then, could &s;he derive from becoming the mother of an infant, who, under the&s;e &s;uppo&s;i|tions, would be ignorant of her very exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>If Sir William, therefore, really fore&s;aw any advantage po&s;&s;ible to accrue to her from the birth of the child, it mu&s;t be his having determined, under &s;ome circum&s;tances, to leave it to her care. But when &s;he recalled the earne&s;t wi&s;h he had formerly expre&s;&s;ed for an heir, and the very evi|dent care he took to pre&s;erve the exi&s;tence of the unborn infant, &s;he could not for a moment in|dulge a hope, that this would be the ca&s;e if the
<PB N="136" REF="036127_0348_1008524C417F8B80">
child were a boy. The hope, therefore, which in &s;o doubtful a manner he had endeavoured to in&s;pire her with, &s;eemed to re&s;t upon one of the&s;e two &s;uppo&s;itions: Either that he had &s;ugge&s;ted it merely as a means to quiet the fir&s;t exce&s;&s;es of her grief, without any intention of its being followed by any real good to her; or, that if the child proved a girl, he did in truth propo&s;e to leave her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. To this latter po&s;&s;ibility &s;he clang with a fond partiality, as to the only &s;ource of happine&s;s which remained to her on this &s;ide the grave.</P>
<P>The more &s;he con&s;idered the matter, the more &s;he per&s;uaded her&s;elf it was probable: and the more it appeared probable, the more it became nece&s;&s;ary to her. Soon her mind could admit of no other idea. The gloom of the pri&s;on &s;eemed to clear up, its &s;olitude to di&s;appear. Wherever &s;he turned her eyes, this little girl was before her. She &s;aw it in the helple&s;s fatuity of the fir&s;t weeks of its life. She marked the fir&s;t &s;mile of intelligence that &s;parkled in its eyes. She beheld the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of de&s;ign in its actions. She heard the fir&s;t half-formed articulate &s;ound which e&s;caped from its lips. In imagination &s;he began the ta&s;k of in&s;truction, and beheld her mo&s;t ar|duous efforts repaid a thou&s;and fold, by having gained a companion and a friend.</P>
<P>If &s;uch an illu&s;ory progre&s;&s;ion of but too often unreali&s;ed bli&s;s fills the brea&s;t of every tender and reflecting female, when about to become a mo|ther, and communicates a &s;en&s;e of happine&s;s, un|felt and unimagined in every other circum&s;tance, even in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous life, with what tremb|ling tran&s;port mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;olated Ellen con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|plate a ble&s;&s;ing which would be her only one&punc;

How mu&s;t &s;he prize a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which was to be her <HI>all</HI> of joy? And how mu&s;t her heart grow cold as &s;he thought this ble&s;&s;ing might be withheld from her&mdash;that this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion might be &s;natched from her arms.</P>
<P>But that all this fabric of happine&s;s &s;hould de|pend upon the &s;ex of her child, when her heart was di&s;po&s;ed to love equally a boy or girl, pointed to her apprehen&s;ion the peculiar wretchedne&s;s of her fate, the circum&s;tances of which could &s;u&s;|pend the mo&s;t natural affections of the &s;oul, and render it doubtful whether a mother &s;hould view the face of her offspring with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A &s;hort period brought the matter to an i&s;&s;ue: and Ellen was delivered of a daughter. Ellen cla&s;ped the infant to her heart; and forgot for a moment her captivity. The next &s;he feared to lo&s;e what &s;he &s;o highly prized. Tho&s;e rea&s;onings which had before appeared &s;o conclu&s;ively to in|&s;ure her the undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a daughter, now &s;eemed weak and un&s;atisfactory. She doubted where &s;he had before been certain. She feared where &s;he had hoped.</P>
<P>In the mean time, &s;he recovered her health much fa&s;ter than could have been hoped: and, fully occupied in nur&s;ing her little girl, the days pa&s;&s;ed ea&s;ily. She began to believe, that Sir William had cea&s;ed to think either of her or his child: and tru&s;ting in the vici&s;&s;itudes which time always produces, &s;he &s;oothed her mind with the di&s;tant hope, that a period would arrive when &s;he &s;hould be re&s;tored to tho&s;e &s;he loved.</P>
<P>Could &s;he have found any means of informing her family and friends of her &s;ituation, &s;he would have been far from feeling her pre&s;ent lot as an

unhappy one. It was the thought of what they would &s;uffer on her &s;uppo&s;ed death, which at this time formed her bittere&s;t reflections. Removed from the perpetual ill humour and injurious &s;u&s;|picions of Sir William, mi&s;tre&s;s of her time and her employments, holding in her arms, or nou|ri&s;hing at her brea&s;t the dear object of her ten|dere&s;t affections, &s;he experienced a degree of calm &s;atisfaction which had long been a &s;tranger to her mind&mdash;that mind unclouded by &s;elf-reproach, un|di&s;tracted by &s;elfi&s;h &s;olicitudes, repo&s;ed it&s;elf in peace on the protection of a Providence, who&s;e wi&s;dom it could not doubt, and of who&s;e good|ne&s;s it was a&s;&s;ured.</P>
<P>Three months were now fully pa&s;t &s;ince the birth of Ellen's daughter: and to the partial ap|prehen&s;ions of the mother &s;he was already become a very intere&s;ting companion. Ellen believed, or thought &s;he believed, that there were none of her actions which the child did not under&s;tand: and &s;he was more than repaid the compliment by un|doubtedly under&s;tanding all that the child did.</P>
<P>Ellen now wanted no other companion. To Mary &s;he talked; and to Mary &s;he &s;ung. She held her in her arms all day: and when &s;he had placed her in her crib for the night, &s;he drew her chair clo&s;e to it, and, with her eyes fixed more upon the face of the child, than upon the book &s;he held in her hand and imagined that &s;he read. The fear that her trea&s;ure &s;hould be &s;natched from her now &s;eldom obtruded it&s;elf. Every pa&s;&s;ing day took away from the probability of its being realized. If it occurred, &s;he was tempted to con&s;ider it as an ungrateful doubting of the benevolence of Providence: and &s;he re|pre&s;&s;ed, as faulty, all thoughts that led to it.</P>

<P>IN this &s;tate of contentment and &s;ecurity was Ellen, when, one morning, as &s;he was engaged in &s;uckling her child, Mrs. Ulric entered. Ellen rai&s;ed her eyes towards her, and was immediately &s;truck with the &s;adne&s;s of her countenance. Ellen, who in holding her child in her arms, felt that all the trea&s;ure &s;he had on earth was &s;ecure, thought not of her&s;elf. She held out her hand to Mrs. Ulric; and longed for words to inquire into the cau&s;e of her grief, and to offer her con&s;olation. But, alas! &s;he was her&s;elf the true object of com|pa&s;&s;ion. Mrs. Ulric &s;at down by her &s;ide. She &s;ighed; and, taking the infant from her, delivered her a letter.</P>
<P>Ellen ca&s;t her eyes on the &s;uper&s;cription. She knew Sir William's hand: and &s;he anticipated, in a moment, all he had to &s;ay to her. The blood for&s;ook her lips. She became &s;ick: and her whole frame trembled &s;o extremely, that it was with difficulty &s;he opened the letter. The&s;e were its contents:</P>
<P>'I am willing to per&s;uade my&s;elf that my pre&s;ent de&s;ign will meet with a ready acquie&s;cence from you. The per&s;on who delivers this letter, has orders to take charge of my daughter. She

will be conveyed to me with every &s;olicitous at|tention to her &s;afety and convenience, which you could your&s;elf dictate. I believe, that as your good &s;en&s;e will withhold you from any oppo&s;ition to this plan, which, you mu&s;t be convinced, will ultimately prove fruitle&s;s; &s;o I am per&s;uaded your humanity is &s;uch, as to take from you all &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ire to make this innocent victim of your mi&s;|conduct, a partaker of your puni&s;hment. When &s;eparated from you, &s;he will be in the full enjoy|ment of every ble&s;&s;ing a father's affection can be&s;tow: and you &s;urely cannot but wi&s;h that her cheek may for ever remain untinged by a &s;en&s;e of your &s;hame, and her heart unwounded by a know|ledge of your afflictions. If your heart &s;adden with the thought, that you will never behold her more, be con&s;oled by the a&s;&s;urance, that from this period I &s;hall promote her happine&s;s even at the expen&s;e of my own. For a mea&s;ure &s;o con&s;onant to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of your offspring, no apology appears nece&s;&s;ary: and for the manner in which I &s;ee proper to di&s;po&s;e of my own, I do not con|ceive I owe you any. With every wi&s;h, how|ever, for the perfect re&s;toration of peace to your bo&s;om, I now bid you finally and for ever fare|wel.'</P>
<P>'Never, never&punc;' &s;aid Ellen, wildly &s;natching the infant from Mrs. Ulric, 'will I part with my child. Go, go and tell his agent &s;o. Toge|ther they may force us from this place: but never &s;hall they &s;eparate us.'</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulric was prepared for the tears and the grief of Ellen. But the wildne&s;s of her air, and the determined tone of her voice &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;concerted her.</P>
<P>'Ah! madam,' &s;aid &s;he, 'would you have
<PB N="141" REF="036127_0353_1008525955F08808">
this poor innocent remain a perpetual pri&s;oner with you?'</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, &s;he fixed her eyes upon the child, with a look of the tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion. The &s;ound of her voice, and her action &s;mote upon Ellen's heart. She bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>'No,' rejoined Mrs. Ulric, 'you are too good:' and &s;he attempted to take the child from her. But Ellen cla&s;ping it to her brea&s;t, ru&s;hed into the next room, and fa&s;tened the door. Here in a tumult of pa&s;&s;ion, which, for &s;ome time, &s;u&s;|pended every power of rea&s;on, Ellen wept over her infant in all the bitterne&s;s of di&s;traction and de&s;pair. But in the abodes where virtue is ac|cu&s;tomed to pre&s;ide, the u&s;urpation of pa&s;&s;ion can be of no long duration. Ellen was not &s;o lo&s;t in &s;elf as to forget her child: and no &s;ooner did her heart acknowledge the cruelty there might be in a wi&s;h to detain her with her, than her part was taken. But it was with a pang, far exceeding his, who, in his ha&s;te to e&s;cape from immediate danger, de&s;troys with his own hand that pro|perty, on which alone all his future hopes of hap|pine&s;s depend, that Ellen re&s;olved to part with her daughter. Never had &s;he felt a mi&s;ery &s;o in|&s;upportable, and which &s;eemed &s;o entirely to drive rea&s;on from her &s;eat, as was inflicted by the thought, that &s;he beheld, for the la&s;t time, this object &s;o beloved. To be re&s;tored to &s;ociety and reputation, now became a hundred fold more important to her than ever: and the de&s;pair of ever being able to accompli&s;h a purpo&s;e, now &s;o momentous, drove her to the point of di&s;traction&punc; Suddenly a gleam of hope bur&s;t through this gloom.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="036127_0354_1008525C50DDD348">'My infant &s;hall be the bearer of a letter to her father,' &s;aid Ellen. 'If I can but once in|duce him to hear me, I mu&s;t be ju&s;tified.' At this thought, the turbulence of her pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub|&s;ided. She became calm. 'Who can tell,' cried &s;he, fre&s;h hope kindling in her heart, 'but the&s;e are the very means a merciful God, who never forgets his creatures' &s;ufferings, has ap|pointed for my deliverance.'</P>
<P>Ellen &s;oon afterwards appeared before Mrs. Ulric, who ea&s;ily comprehended by the &s;ettled, calm, and deep &s;orrow, which had taken place of a violence &s;o unu&s;ual, that Ellen was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the commands of Sir William. Ellen, however, by never quitting her child for a mo|ment, and by evidently keeping over it a jealous and &s;u&s;picious watch, &s;hewed that &s;he meant not to part with it immediately. Mrs. Ulric was willing to wait at lea&s;t till the next day, before &s;he took any forcible means to deprive her of it: and &s;o far their intentions agreed, that Ellen had no de&s;ign of retaining it longer with her than till the next morning. This night, this la&s;t night that &s;he might ever embrace it, when the hour of its repo&s;e came, &s;he placed it, not as u&s;ual into its crib, but holding it on her knees, there lulled it to &s;leep. In this po&s;ture, with her heart filled with de&s;pair, and her eyes overflowing with the bittere&s;t tears that ever woman &s;hed, &s;he wrote the following letter to Sir William.</P>
<P>'To the voice of rea&s;on and of humanity may my heart never be deaf! though in obeying their dictates that heart &s;hould cleave in twain.</P>
<P>'I deliver my daughter to you, becau&s;e &s;he is yours al&s;o; and becau&s;e I wi&s;h not for any al|leviation to my &s;orrows, which mu&s;t ari&s;e from

my a&s;&s;ociating her in my misfortune: But what|ever may be her de&s;tiny, as to happine&s;s; or mi|&s;ery, &s;he <HI>cannot</HI> be the victim of my crimes; for <HI>I am guiltle&s;s.</HI> The angels of heaven are not more free of the crime of which you accu&s;e me than I am.</P>
<P>'You have &s;aid, you li&s;ten not to the voice of penitence. It is not the voice of penitence, it is the cry of innocence that a&s;&s;ails you, an innocence as &s;potle&s;s, in all that relates to you, as that of the babe who now looks upon you, and bids you do ju&s;tice to her injured mother.</P>
<P>'I am unable to under&s;tand the circum&s;tances upon which you have condemned me. I can therefore make no defence except you will explain your&s;elf farther. Be ju&s;t alike to your&s;elf and me&mdash;&s;ee me&mdash;hear me&mdash;I a&s;k not this as a favour from your pity, or your love. I demand it as a right. I demand it in compa&s;&s;ion to you, as well as my&s;elf. My ruin involves your condemnation. I would pre&s;erve you from too late a repentance. Refu&s;e not to li&s;ten to this &s;olicitation. Con|&s;idering the precautions you have taken, it is the la&s;t that can ever reach you. It is the &s;olicitation &mdash;I mu&s;t &s;peak out, for who have I to &s;peak for me! of &s;uffering virtue, of oppre&s;&s;ed innocence, of wounded ju&s;tice. Oh! Sir William, when I offer &s;o cruel a &s;acrifice to the rights you a&s;&s;ert over me, deny me not that, which the mo&s;t abject criminal may exact.'</P>
<P>Ellen continued to hold her infant on her knees, and to gaze on its face through the whole of this di&s;tre&s;sful night, without the power of clo&s;ing her eyes, or lo&s;ing in forgetfulne&s;s the &s;en&s;e of her wretchedne&s;s for one &s;ingle moment. When the morning dawned, the infant awoke. Ellen put it
<PB N="144" REF="036127_0356_10085261D93F93C8">
to her brea&s;t. 'Deare&s;t of human creatures,' &s;aid &s;he, pre&s;&s;ing it clo&s;ely to her, 'and do I give thee &s;u&s;tenance for the la&s;t time? Oh! my God, enable me to &s;upport a deprivation &s;o cruel!'</P>
<P>Ellen then proceeded to dre&s;s her child; and &s;ewing up the letter &s;he de&s;igned for Sir William in a piece of cloth, &s;he fa&s;tened it under the upper ve&s;t of the infant. To have endeavoured to convey it by any other means, &s;he was a&s;&s;ured would have been fruitle&s;s: but &s;he per&s;uaded her|&s;elf, that nothing could be more certain, than that whoever found a paper directed to Sir Wil|liam in the clothes of his child, would carefully deliver it to him: and &s;he thought it very impro|bable, that the per&s;on appointed to convey the child, and who would not have &s;een her, &s;hould have received any prohibition as to forwarding any letter from her: and even if &s;uch a prohibition had been given, it would hardly appear a di&s;re|gard of it, to deliver a paper found upon the per|&s;on of the child, the writer of which could at mo&s;t only be gue&s;&s;ed at. The&s;e con&s;iderations tranquilized her as to the delivery of the letter: but the reception it would meet with, and the effect it would produce, were matters of much more doubtful event.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of her own innocence, Ellen's fir&s;t thoughts had led her to believe that it was only nece&s;&s;ary to be heard, to make this innocence evi|dent: and from the &s;ame purity of mind, &s;he had felt a perfect confidence, that Sir William's con|duct originated rather from mi&s;taken ideas of the puni&s;hment due to the crime he &s;uppo&s;ed her to have been guilty of, than from any ju&s;tifiable re|&s;entment for that want of love on her part, of which he was accu&s;tomed to complain, but which,
<PB N="145" REF="036127_0357_10085264C1E8FF98">
he mu&s;t be convinced, aro&s;e wholly from his own unkindne&s;s towards her.</P>
<P>More reflection had introduced ideas into her mind much le&s;s favourable to Sir William. She could not imagine any circum&s;tances from which &s;uch a mi&s;take, as that on which &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed Sir William to act, could have ari&s;en. The ap|peal which he made to the evidence of his own &s;en&s;es, &s;trengthened the &s;u&s;picion of unfair deal|ing on his part: and it had received additional force by the unnece&s;&s;ary cruelty which appeared in his &s;o carefully &s;hutting from her all means of making any application to him, and in the un|feeling har&s;hne&s;s di&s;coverable in more parts than one of his la&s;t letter.</P>
<P>Added to the&s;e con&s;iderations, were others that &s;eemed &s;carcely le&s;s to militate again&s;t the hopes of her deliverance. She knew well the &s;tructure of Sir William's mind. She knew how little &s;he had to hope from his genero&s;ity or can|dour. She knew the pertinacity with which he adhered to all his opinions, the reluctance which he felt to acknowledge him&s;elf mi&s;taken in the mere&s;t trifles: and &s;he could hardly flatter her|&s;elf, that if he <HI>were</HI> convinced, that he had fallen into an error, he would act from &s;uch a convic|tion, when, by &s;o doing, he mu&s;t &s;o painfully e&s;ta|bli&s;h her &s;uperiority, and place him&s;elf for the re&s;t of their lives, in the light of the offending party. As &s;he was aware how impo&s;&s;ible it would be to per&s;uade him, that &s;he really and in fact was capable of forgiving, and bani&s;hing from her mind a &s;en&s;e of the injuries he had done her, and as &s;he knew he would feel a&s;&s;ured that he mu&s;t ne|ver hope to po&s;&s;e&s;s her love, &s;he but too rea&s;on|ably concluded, that if even any love for her re|mained,
<PB N="146" REF="036127_0358_10085266680FC0A8">
it would not be &s;ufficiently powerful to induce him to re&s;tore her to &s;ociety under cir|cum&s;tances &s;o di&s;gracefully humiliating, and &s;o little happy to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections would probably have had in|fluence enough to have prevented any attempt on her part towards moving Sir William in her fa|vour, and might have put her upon turning her thoughts to &s;ome more certain, though more di&s;|tant, means of deliverance, if the in&s;upportable agony which &s;he felt, on the threatened lo&s;s of her child, had not made her con&s;ider all delay in the hopes of rejoining it, a lengthened torture of &s;o acute a kind, that &s;he doubted her own abi|lity to endure it with tolerable patience.</P>
<P>This feeling, and the reflexion, that if &s;he now o|mitted any one po&s;&s;ible means of declaring her inno|cence, it might hereafter be urged as a remi&s;&s;ne&s;s ari&s;ing from con&s;cious guilt, had determined her to try the fate of a letter to Sir William. But although, in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, this was <HI>all</HI> &s;he could do, &s;o little did it appear likely to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, that it was wholly ineffica|cious in abating that mi&s;ery which the idea of &s;e|paration from her child had impre&s;&s;ed upon her mind: and when the letter was written and depo|&s;ited under the infant's clothes, a melancholy &s;en&s;e of its probable inutility filled her brea&s;t; and gave to the approaching deprivation all the horrors due to a farewel, which, as to this world, was to be final.</P>
<P>Ellen, notwith&s;tanding the oppre&s;&s;ion of her feelings, wi&s;hed to conquer her&s;elf &s;o far as to do that which &s;he had re&s;olved upon, with dignity and compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>The opening and &s;hutting of the doors in the
<PB N="147" REF="036127_0359_1008526A572DBF10">
gallery now told her &s;he might expect the ap|proach of Mrs. Ulric every moment. Her eyes were alternately fixed on the face of her child, and now turned with a look of apprehen&s;ion to the door. She pre&s;&s;ed her lips to tho&s;e of the poor baby, with a fervency which, at any other time, &s;he would not have dared to have indulged, from the fear of hurting it. Every ki&s;s imprinted &s;he thought was to be the la&s;t: and as &s;he intently gazed upon its features, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed each &s;eparately, with a &s;en&s;ation of de&s;pair which ought only to belong to the guilty. Happy was it for the intel|lects of Ellen, that this &s;cene was not much far|ther prolonged.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulric came towards her: and Ellen ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, with an effort that required all her forti|tude, put the child into her arms, and ru&s;hed from her into the next room. Mrs. Ulric, &s;truck with her courage, and moved by the tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, committed the infant to the care of tho&s;e who already waited to receive it; and then ha&s;tened back, with all the di&s;patch in her power, to admini&s;ter to Ellen all the con&s;olation which her humanity could afford. But Ellen remained long in&s;en&s;ible to her kindne&s;s and her cares. Mrs. Ulric found her, on her return, in the highe&s;t &s;tate of hy&s;teric affection. The di&s;order baffled all the remedies which Mrs. Ulric's &s;kill in medicine could &s;ugge&s;t; and continued &s;o long un&s;ubdued as to rai&s;e in her mind very &s;erious apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>At length, nature &s;eemed quite exhau&s;ted: and Ellen fell into a heavy &s;leep, which continued for &s;ome hours. When &s;he awoke, &s;he was le&s;s agitated, but &s;o extremely reduced in &s;trength,
<PB N="148" REF="036127_0360_1008526C1ED226E8">
as to be unable to quit her bed, or &s;carcely to rai&s;e her head from her pillow.</P>
<P>She continued for &s;ome time &s;ubject to returns of the hy&s;terical di&s;order: and when &s;he appeared to be recovered from the&s;e attacks, &s;he was &s;eized with a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, which incapacitated her from all exertion; and &s;eemed to deprive her even of the power of thinking.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulric conceived nothing more likely to remove this kind of indi&s;po&s;ition than the open air, and a variety of objects. The latter it was not in her power, to any extent, to afford her unhappy patient. But &s;he accompanied her for whole days in the garden, where &s;he often in|duced her to continue by &s;preading a repa&s;t under the &s;hade of the trees, or by bringing her the harp, and intimating a de&s;ire to hear her play upon it. Ellen was not lo&s;t to the plea&s;ure of ob|liging: and in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her mind, hav|ing no de&s;ires of her own, &s;he &s;eemed wholly di|rected by tho&s;e of her companion. Mrs. Ulric, &s;omewhat to vary the &s;cene, ventured to unlock the garden door, and to walk &s;ome little way into the adjacent country. The door opened upon a wild heath, which was &s;kirted by a thick wood, and in this wood they frequently walked. In&s;en|&s;ibly this wi&s;e and gentle treatment produced the de&s;ired effect; Ellen began to awake, as it were, from the lethargy into which &s;he had fallen. Her powers of rea&s;oning returned: and if &s;he felt more, &s;he acknowledged, that a &s;tate of &s;o alarm|ing an in&s;en&s;ibility was well exchanged for one of &s;uffering. The fir&s;t reflection &s;he made was on the length of time which had elap&s;ed &s;ince the departure of her child, and when &s;he found that
<PB N="149" REF="036127_0361_1008527106866CE8">
&s;ix weeks were gone, never more to return, &s;he gave up all hopes of receiving her deliverance from the ju&s;tice or genero&s;ity of Sir William.</P>
<P>How he might have been affected, if the letter had reached his hands, it is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay: but the trial was never made: and Ellen owed the lo&s;s of this feeble chance in her favour, nei|ther to de&s;ign or treachery, but merely to acci|dent.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance of any paper being concealed in the piece of cloth which Ellen had fa&s;tened round the body of the child, had e&s;caped the no|tice of its attendant. She had taken it merely for a part of its garments, and with the re&s;t of them having been &s;ent to the wa&s;her-woman, Ellen's letter, in fragments and defaced, floated &s;oon upon the water.</P>
<P>As Ellen had never attached much hope to this attempt to move Sir William in her favour, &s;he viewed the total di&s;appointment of it without any of tho&s;e acute feelings which might probably have precipitated her again into the melancholy &s;tate of mind from which &s;he had only began to emerge: and it might indeed be owing to her feel|ings being blunted, as it were, by what &s;he had undergone, that &s;he bore &s;o calmly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat &s;he con&s;idered as an undeniable proof of Sir Wil|liam's premeditated inju&s;tice.</P>

<P>EVERY day Ellen began to recover her faculties: and &s;he u&s;ed every means in her power to rou&s;e her&s;elf to exertion, and to train her mind to fortitude. Patience and re&s;ignation, thought &s;he, are all the virtues which I am permitted to practi&s;e. In the fir&s;t moments of my over|whelming affliction, I was &s;aved, by in&s;en&s;ibility, from the nece&s;&s;ity of an exertion, which it might have been impo&s;&s;ible to have made; for what I then failed in, I am not re&s;pon&s;ible. I am now called to make u&s;e of the rea&s;on which is re&s;tored to me; and let me attend to the call: That life is a blank, which is unmarked with the efforts of virtue: but it is a blank, which I &s;hall be called to account for in another.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the&s;e reflections Ellen began, for the fir&s;t time, to turn her attention to her books. She found the collection well cho&s;en, and evidently with attention to her peculiar ta&s;te. This circum&s;tance &s;oftened her heart toward Sir William. Some few which &s;he wi&s;hed to have
<PB N="151" REF="036127_0363_10085276DCEDCEB8">
were wanting. She wrote down the names, and delivering the li&s;t to Mrs. Ulric, &s;aw her &s;ign the paper. She readily under&s;tood, that this was the proof agreed upon, by which its authenticity was to be a&s;certained. She ob&s;erved, however, that Mrs. Ulric carefully in&s;pected the articles: and Ellen &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he was in&s;tructed, notwith&s;tanding her ignorance of the French language, how to di&s;tingui&s;h between what was allowed and what was forbidden. Books, however, had been ex|pre&s;sly named by Sir William, as what would be con&s;idered a lawful requi&s;ition: and Ellen was therefore not &s;urpri&s;ed to find her&s;elf &s;peedily &s;up|plied with what &s;he wanted. As this, however, was the fir&s;t experiment of the kind &s;he had made, &s;he felt a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure in its &s;ucce&s;s. There was &s;omething in it, which connected her again with the world, from which, before, &s;he &s;eemed &s;o totally excluded: and when &s;he found, with certainty, that, by the &s;troke of her pen, &s;he could procure any gratification, or nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he wanted, &s;he no longer felt her&s;elf abandoned to the degree &s;he had conceived before.</P>
<P>The evenings now grew long, and the days cold. She lived more in the hou&s;e; and con&s;equently wanted a greater variety of employments there. She had no call for works either of ornament or u&s;e. With re&s;pect to her clothes, &s;he was &s;up|plied with a greater profu&s;ion than &s;he had any nece&s;&s;ity for. They were all, it is true, of the plaine&s;t kind, and &s;uch as (though they were per|fectly conformable to her) could not be converted into bribes to tho&s;e about her. To work without any end, would defeat her purpo&s;e; for how could &s;he be intere&s;ted in the progre&s;s of an em|ployment, which, in the end, mu&s;t be u&s;ele&s;s?
<PB N="152" REF="036127_0364_10085279E7CCE760">
and &s;he found books and mu&s;ic were not &s;ufficient to carry her through wet and gloomy days, &s;uc|ceeded by long and tempe&s;tuous evenings, with|out the aid of conver&s;ation or exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>In this de&s;titution of employment, her mind preyed too much upon it&s;elf: and when her imagination repre&s;ented to her the di&s;tre&s;s of her family and friends for her lo&s;s&mdash;or when &s;he thought of her own captivity, cut off in her early youth from every &s;ocial affection, and from every active duty&mdash;but, above all, when &s;he reflected upon her &s;eparation from her child, &s;he found the ta&s;k of re&s;ignation almo&s;t beyond her power.</P>
<P>Anxiou&s;ly &s;he ca&s;t her eyes around for &s;ome means of filling her time and employing her thoughts. Happily it occurred to her, that part of her Northumberland education had been the art of &s;pinning. No &s;ooner did &s;he recollect this, than &s;he &s;et about procuring a wheel, and every nece&s;&s;ary to her employment. She knew the perfection to which the Bohemian linens were brought: and therefore concluded, &s;he &s;hould find all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance to her manufacture which &s;he could de&s;ire. She found her orders for a wheel as &s;peedily complied with as had been the one &s;he gave for books: and &s;he began her new occupation without delay.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulric &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed when &s;he &s;aw her thus employed; and bu&s;ied her&s;elf in re|moving any trifling difficulties which aro&s;e. This new intere&s;t produced a fre&s;h tie between them. Mrs. Ulric frequently brought her work, and pa&s;&s;ed the whole evening with Ellen. It is true, they could not conver&s;e: but they had by this time e&s;tabli&s;hed a kind of language between them|&s;elves, which &s;erved extremely well for all com|mon
<PB N="153" REF="036127_0365_1008527CE7EA1808">
purpo&s;es: and Ellen had even attained the knowledge of the meaning and the pronunciation of &s;everal German words.</P>
<P>This knowledge, however, &s;he acquired again&s;t the inclination of Mrs. Ulric: for Ellen ea&s;ily perceived, that &s;he &s;eemed to be &s;orry when any word had e&s;caped her: and the pertinacity with which &s;he always declined repeating any word which Ellen endeavoured to pronounce after her, and her apparent wilful mi&s;conception, whenever Ellen took any means of inducing her to teach her in German the names of tho&s;e objects with which they were &s;urrounded, made it clear to Ellen, that &s;he lay under the &s;tricte&s;t po&s;&s;ible prohibition as to teaching her the language: and &s;he &s;aw, that &s;he adhered to her orders, with an integrity which all her attachment to Ellen, and the plea&s;ure which it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he would naturally have taken in conver&s;ing with her, could not &s;hake.</P>
<P>Ellen revered Mrs. Ulric the more for this &s;teady adherence to what, &s;he had no doubt, was with her a point of duty: and &s;he ea&s;ily forgave the effect, in con&s;ideration of the cau&s;e, though the dreary melancholy of her life was &s;o beyond mea&s;ure increa&s;ed by this very circum&s;tance. Had it not been for tho&s;e &s;cruples in Mrs. Ulric, nothing could have been more ea&s;y than for Ellen to have learnt German: and as &s;he never lo&s;t &s;ight of the hope of acquiring the language, as one mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential means to bring about her deliverance: &s;he trea&s;ured up in her memory all that &s;he had learnt from Mrs. Ulric: and in &s;pite of her precaution, &s;he added almo&s;t daily &s;omething to her &s;tore.</P>
<P>The winter pa&s;&s;ed away: the &s;pinning plan
<PB N="154" REF="036127_0366_1008527FE4F169A8">
had &s;ucceeded fully: and Ellen now began to in|tere&s;t her&s;elf about the cloth which was to be &s;ent to the weaver, and that which was to be returned from him. She could not &s;ometimes help &s;miling at the artificial bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he had contrived for her|&s;elf, and at the perfect earne&s;tne&s;s in which &s;he &s;aw Mrs. Ulric about the matter. But &s;he care|fully avoided de&s;troying the illu&s;ion, and went on &s;pinning as if her web were to be as long as Pene|lope's might have been, but for "the back|ward labours of her hand."</P>
<P>Ellen's health was now thoroughly re-e&s;tab|li&s;hed: and &s;he endeavoured to add a degree of cheerfulne&s;s to the patience and re&s;ignation which &s;he had hitherto practi&s;ed. By frequently re|peating to her&s;elf all the German &s;he could ac|quire from her companion, her thoughts were more than ever fixed upon the language: and with &s;o few circum&s;tances to divert them from any object, which even from a flight motive might have engaged them, it is not wonderful, if they were almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly bent upon one, from which &s;o important an advantage might be gained&mdash; to attain the German language became now the fir&s;t wi&s;h of Ellen's mind; and &s;he was re&s;olved to take &s;ome vigorous &s;tep towards it.</P>
<P>She had hitherto forborne to &s;end for the books nece&s;&s;ary to her in&s;truction, as far as it was po&s;|&s;ible &s;he could in&s;truct her&s;elf, from an apprehen|&s;ion that this was a reque&s;t upon which Mrs. Ulric would infallibly put a negative: But ob&s;erving that Mrs. Ulric now &s;eldom ca&s;t her eye over the articles contained in the li&s;ts &s;he &s;igned, &s;he re|&s;olved to hazard the attempt.</P>
<P>Among&s;t &s;everal other things which &s;he &s;ent for, only with the de&s;ign of making the li&s;t larger,
<PB N="155" REF="036127_0367_10085282C8FAE3A0">
that &s;o any particular article might more probably pa&s;s unnoticed, &s;he put down all the German books which &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary to her purpo&s;e. She delivered this li&s;t to Mrs. Ulric the next time &s;he vi&s;ited her apartment. It was with no &s;mall degree of &s;olicitude that &s;he attended its fate: But &s;he had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee it &s;igned without he&s;i|tation or in&s;pection, and in&s;tantly &s;ealed and di|rected, by which di&s;patch &s;he concluded that there was &s;ome immediate means of &s;ending it to Dre&s;|den; and &s;he was confirmed in this conjecture by the &s;peed with which &s;he received the pacquet in return. And now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;he had a &s;ecret from Mrs. Ulric. She carefully locked up her German trea&s;ure, and took care to &s;ecure the door of her room whenever &s;he recurred to the &s;tudy of that language. It was with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity that &s;he pur&s;ued her ta&s;k, but without &s;ome oral a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he &s;oon &s;aw cau&s;e to fear that &s;he &s;hould make no progre&s;s that could be u&s;eful to the great purpo&s;e, for which alone, at this time, &s;he had thought of acquiring the knowledge of the German tongue. She found, however, an incidental advantage in her new &s;tudy: this was employment; and German for a time &s;uper&s;eded &s;pinning.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;everal occupations, diver&s;ified with mu&s;ic and che&s;s, in which &s;he had di&s;covered Mrs. Ulric to be &s;omewhat of a proficient, with a regular cour&s;e of reading, and in the regulation of her own mind, &s;upported with a vague hope that at &s;ome di&s;tant period her deliverance might make a part of the de&s;igns of Providence, Ellen pa&s;&s;ed her time: and &s;uch was the tranquility which the innocence of her heart and the equa|nimity of her temper &s;ecured to her, under the

deprivation of nearly all that is &s;uppo&s;ed to make life de&s;irable, that not only &s;he enjoyed a degree of happine&s;s unknown to the mo&s;t pro&s;perous guilt, but &s;uch as is unattainable even in the over eager pur&s;uit of the mo&s;t legitimate objects: Her mind was calm and vigorous, her body healthy and ac|tive; the ro&s;es, which even the chagrins of the fir&s;t months of her marriage had bani&s;hed, re|turned to her cheeks; her eyes recovered their vivacity; her well formed limbs acquired all their natural agility, and perhaps Ellen had never, in the whole cour&s;e of her life, appeared an object &s;o proper to excite love and admiration, as &s;he did at this pre&s;ent period&mdash;and mu&s;t it be, that &s;uch a ro&s;e is doomed for ever <Q>'To wa&s;te its &s;weetne&s;s on the de&s;art air.'</Q></P>

<P>TWO years were now pa&s;&s;ed, and a third far advanced, &s;ince Ellen entered the walls of this dreary habitation. No change &s;eemed to await her: and amid&s;t the never cea&s;ing vici&s;&s;itudes of human affairs, her fate alone &s;eemed fixed; as if the grave, indeed, had inclo&s;ed her. But he who could break the bonds of death, was not impotent to open the doors of her pri&s;on.</P>
<P>About this period Mrs. Ulric fell ill; and her illne&s;s proved a rheumatic fever. Ellen attended her with all the a&s;&s;iduity that affection and grati|tude could in&s;pire; &s;he furni&s;hed her chamber with every po&s;&s;ible accommodation, from her own: She frequently pa&s;&s;ed the night by her bed &s;ide, and thought nothing painful to her&s;elf that could contribute to alleviate the pains of Mrs. Ulric.</P>
<P>It was in her frequent vi&s;its to the chamber of the invalid, that Ellen fir&s;t ob&s;erved that the un|der &s;ervant had been changed; and that her &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or was a German. To this per&s;on, as Mrs. Ulric her&s;elf was entirely incapable of attending upon Ellen, devolved all the duties of waiting upon her meals, or admini&s;tring to her any little
<PB N="158" REF="036127_0370_1008528C8141DA88">
&s;ervices &s;he might want. Ellen ob&s;erved that &s;he performed all this with &s;omething more than a common zeal to oblige: that &s;he appeared plea&s;ed to be employed: and often lingered in her apart|ments without any apparent rea&s;on. Ellen im|puted all this to the natural good humour of the girl; who might probably be moved by the &s;tate of captivity which &s;he could not but know &s;he was in. It occurred to her that &s;he might turn this compa&s;&s;ion to &s;omewhat better advantage than merely having her dinner warmer, or more nicely &s;erved, by learning from her new attendant the better pronunciation of &s;ome German words. She made the experiment, and found it fully an&s;wered by the alacrity with which the girl &s;eemed willing to enter into conver&s;ation. She ob&s;erved that &s;he &s;poke, what appeared to her to be purer German than that &s;poken by Mrs. Ulric; and from hence &s;he concluded her to be a Saxon. This idea led her to imagine it highly probable that &s;he could read; and if it &s;hould prove &s;o, behold her at length furni&s;hed with a preceptre&s;s in the German tongue.</P>
<P>She made the trial on the in&s;tant, and was &s;oon convinced that her conjecture was well founded. The girl read with fluency and plea&s;ure; &s;eeming de&s;irous to recommend her&s;elf to Ellen to the be&s;t of her power. The book &s;he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d put into her hands was a book of &s;uch familiar phra&s;es as are calculated for the u&s;e of learners; and when El|len was &s;atisfied with the experiment &s;he had made, &s;he &s;ought a &s;entence expre&s;&s;ive of her thanks; and &s;he read it with as good pronunci|ation as &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of. The girl &s;eemed forcibly &s;truck; and turning over the leaves, &s;topt not until &s;he found an expre&s;&s;ion, the &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="159" REF="036127_0371_1008528E0AA16B98">
which was, 'I owe all to you.' This &s;he pro|nounced with &s;o peculiar an empha&s;is, pointing at the French on the other &s;ide, to Ellen, and looking upon her with &s;o much meaning, and with a countenance &s;o &s;uited to the &s;en&s;e of the words &s;he u&s;ed, that Ellen felt an in&s;tant conviction that &s;he was known.</P>
<P>When words are wanting, the mo&s;t untutored will have recour&s;e to actions. The girl, as if im|patient to explain her&s;elf, threw her&s;elf on her knees before Ellen, and pa&s;&s;ionately ki&s;&s;ing her hand, pronounced the name of the Saxon village in which Ellen had pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many weeks. This word in&s;tantly called to her recollection the fea|tures of the per&s;on before her; and &s;he recog|ni&s;ed the daughter of the cottager, to whom her bounty had furni&s;hed &s;o &s;ea&s;onable a relief, when her habitation had been de&s;troyed by fire.</P>
<P>Ellen's bo&s;om had long been a &s;tranger to the degree of delight which this di&s;covery communi|cated: her quick conception anticipated, in a mo|ment, all the advantages &s;he might derive from it: and her fir&s;t &s;entiment being that of gratitude to an ever-watchful Providence, &s;he threw her|&s;elf on her knees by the girl, and, with uplifted hands and eyes, thanked Heaven for what &s;he felt as an earne&s;t of her deliverance.</P>
<P>From this moment &s;carcely an hour pa&s;&s;ed with|out Ellen making &s;ome advance in her powers of communicating her &s;entiments to her new friend; and as &s;he had from the fir&s;t warned her to con|ceal their intercour&s;e from Mrs. Ulric, their hours of lecture were conducted with the greate&s;t &s;ecrecy. Ellen thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to explain any circum&s;tances of her &s;ituation farther to the girl, than to inform her that &s;he was an Engli&s;h
<PB N="160" REF="036127_0372_100852917032F570">
woman, and to a&s;&s;ure her mo&s;t &s;olemnly that &s;he was unju&s;tly detained from her country and friends; and that all &s;he de&s;ired was the means of relea&s;ing her&s;elf from her pre&s;ent confinement. She, however, fully expo&s;ed her poverty, and her utter inability to reward any ri&s;k the young wo|man might run in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her to e&s;cape. To all &s;uch precautionary information, the girl con&s;tantly replied, in the grateful and affecting words that &s;he had fir&s;t u&s;ed, 'I owe all to you.'</P>
<P>It was only by degrees that they came to un|der&s;tand each other with tolerable ea&s;e: but Ellen learnt, through all the imperfection attending the very fir&s;t of their communication, that her grate|ful Saxon was ready to &s;acrifice every thing for her &s;ake. When &s;he was able more fully to un|der&s;tand her, &s;he learnt that &s;he had only been taken by Mrs. Ulric on a di&s;appointment &s;he had of a &s;ervant whom &s;he had more approved: that as her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depended upon her labour, &s;he did not doubt, as her character was good, of be|ing able to find, without difficulty, as eligible an e&s;tabli&s;hment as her pre&s;ent one, &s;hould &s;he lo&s;e it in con&s;equence of her &s;ervices to Ellen.</P>
<P>Ellen, from her natural abhorrence to all di&s;|gui&s;e, he&s;itated whether &s;he &s;hould not, now &s;he could explain her&s;elf with tolerable facility, take Mrs. Ulric into her confidence; but, upon far|ther reflection, &s;he found, that her pre&s;ent hopes were too dear to be put to hazard by a commu|nication, which, from the proofs &s;he had &s;een of Mrs. Ulric's high &s;en&s;e of the &s;acredne&s;s of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in her, might be the means of de|&s;troying them all together. She con&s;idered that in effecting her e&s;cape, &s;he did ju&s;tice to her&s;elf, without injuring any body: and &s;he felt a&s;&s;ured,
<PB N="161" REF="036127_0373_100852948C8CB520">
from the idea &s;he had formed of Mrs. Ulric's character, that were &s;he acquainted with the whole of the ca&s;e, &s;he would rejoice in her deli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ance.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations determined her to main|tain her &s;ecret. She learnt from There&s;a, the name of Mrs. Ulric, and that of the nobleman in who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he was confined: and no longer wondered, from what &s;he knew of his intimacy with Sir William, that he had been able, with his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o completely to &s;ucceed in his plan of &s;hutting her up.</P>
<P>Some weeks were now elap&s;ed &s;ince Mrs. Ulric had been confined to her bed, and though the force of the di&s;order was abated, &s;he was become &s;o lame, that &s;he could not be moved from thence; however, as &s;ome amendment appeared every day, the time pre&s;&s;ed, for Ellen's be&s;t hopes of a &s;uc|ce&s;sful e&s;cape were placed on her being able to conceal it for &s;ome days from Mrs. Ulric.</P>
<P>There&s;a and &s;he now daily con&s;ulted upon the be&s;t means of effecting this e&s;cape. The ab&s;olute want of money was a great ob&s;tacle; for Ellen was de&s;irous to purcha&s;e a pea&s;ant's dre&s;s of the country, as &s;he hoped, by &s;uch a di&s;gui&s;e, to pa&s;s wholly undi&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e with whom &s;he was to mix. Money was not to be procured: but Ellen &s;ugge&s;ted the po&s;&s;ibility of exchanging &s;ome of her own clothes for tho&s;e of the kind which &s;he now preferred. This was accordingly accom|pli&s;hed; and Ellen found her&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the nece&s;&s;ary garments. There&s;a had informed her, that until &s;he could get beyond the limits of Bohemia, even the little German &s;he knew would &s;carcely be of any u&s;e to her: that the Bohemians
<PB N="162" REF="036127_0374_100852972B997408">
hated the Germans, and could never be induced to apply them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of their language, though there were &s;chools e&s;tabli&s;hed for that purpo&s;e in &s;everal places; that therefore &s;he would find few people in the interior parts of the country who under&s;tood it; and though mo&s;t of the farmers who were &s;ituated on the great roads had a very competent knowledge of German, there were few who would be induced to con|ver&s;e in it: There&s;a therefore advi&s;ed, that laying a&s;ide all attempts at making her&s;elf under&s;tood, &s;he &s;hould tru&s;t wholly to the compa&s;&s;ion which her &s;peechle&s;s wants might excite, and the re|ward which her mu&s;ic might be thought to de|&s;erve.</P>
<P>The idea of the latter re&s;ource had al&s;o been &s;ugge&s;ted by There&s;a, who&s;e two years re&s;idence in a Bohemian &s;ervice had made her very well ac|quainted with the predilection that the lower rank of people in Bohemia bore to mu&s;ic. She had ob|&s;erved Ellen's harp, and had told her that could &s;he carry that with her, a few tunes upon it would &s;carcely ever fail to procure her a draught of milk, or a night's lodging. The harp was too cumber&s;ome for Ellen to think for a moment of burdening her&s;elf with it: &s;he had therefore de|termined to &s;ub&s;titute a mandoline, which &s;he had &s;ent for to Dre&s;den, and There&s;a fully approved of the &s;uccedaneum.</P>
<P>Ellen could not help &s;hrinking from the idea of performing &s;uch a journey as lay before her alone: &s;he would willingly have engaged There&s;a to have accompanied her: &s;he found her perfectly ready to retrace in her company, the &s;teps which had led her from her native village: but, be&s;ides that, Ellen, from her ignorance whether Sir William had returned
<PB N="163" REF="036127_0375_1008529A50888B40">
to England, or had continued abroad; was very unwilling to approach Saxony; it being the place where, in the latter ca&s;e, &s;he was mo&s;t likely to meet with him, or with &s;ome body, who from their connexions with him might know her, &s;he could not con&s;ent to bring There&s;a into a &s;itu|ation where &s;he would again be a burden upon her friends, when &s;he had nothing in her power to make them any compen&s;ation for &s;uch a bur|den.</P>
<P>There were &s;imilar objections to making her the companion of her travels in any other direc|tion: for let her part with her where &s;he would, &s;hort of England, &s;he had nothing wherewith to reward her, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in finding her way home. Ellen's &s;ecret wi&s;h was, that There&s;a would accompany her to England; there &s;he doubted not of being able to make her &s;uch a re|compence as would fully repay her for all her trouble and fatigue; but to &s;o di&s;tant a peregri|nation, Ellen ob&s;erved reluctance in There&s;a, which &s;he was too delicate to try to overcome: and indeed a &s;till farther reflection upon all cir|cum&s;tances, &s;oon reconciled her &s;elf-denial with prudence. She con&s;idered, that if There&s;a ac|companied her, her e&s;cape would be immediately di&s;covered; and as &s;he had no means of &s;peedy flight, and no place of refuge, &s;uch a di&s;covery would inevitably lead to a renewal of her cap|tivity. She recollected what Sir William had &s;aid in his fir&s;t letter, of the precautions he had taken to render abortive all attempts to e&s;cape; and &s;he became convinced that her &s;afety lay in leaving There&s;a behind her, &s;ince by her conti|nuing her attendance in her apartment &s;ome days after her departure, &s;he would not be obliged to
<PB N="164" REF="036127_0376_1008529CF5E59798">
announce her flight until &s;he was &s;ecurely beyond the reach of all pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The place from whence &s;he thought it mo&s;t ea&s;y to e&s;cape, was the garden-door; &s;ince Mrs. Ulric had indulged her with extending her walks beyond the garden, all fa&s;tenings had been re|moved from it except the lock. She &s;hewed the door to There&s;a, who a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he could ea&s;ily find a method of opening that.</P>
<P>Every thing was now arranged. It was agreed that Ellen &s;hould appear indi&s;po&s;ed when &s;he made her la&s;t vi&s;it to Mrs. Ulric before her de|parture: and that the &s;uppo&s;ed continuance of this indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;hould be the excu&s;e that The|re&s;a &s;hould make to Mrs. Ulric for Ellen's unu|&s;ual ab&s;ence from the &s;ick chamber. To give this apology the greater air of truth, Ellen had no &s;ooner determined upon her flight, than &s;he forebore, under one pretence or other, her daily vi&s;its to Mrs. Ulric: and &s;he even &s;ometimes &s;uf|fered two days to pa&s;s without &s;eeing her. This was a &s;evere affliction to Ellen's grateful and feel|ing heart; more e&s;pecially as &s;he could not but ob&s;erve that Mrs. Ulric &s;eemed ca&s;t down by this relaxation in her attentions; but the nece&s;|&s;ity of the ca&s;e &s;ilenced her &s;cruples, and &s;he con&s;oled her&s;elf with the thought that in future &s;he could explain her conduct to her friend, &s;o as fully to exculpate her from any charge of un|kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Ellen took from There&s;a a direction to Mrs. Ulric, to whom &s;he determined to write from England an acknowledgment of all the obligations &s;he had received from her, and to &s;end her &s;ome token of her e&s;teem and gratitude. She al&s;o put down the name of her faithful There&s;a, and
<PB N="165" REF="036127_0377_100852A066F92858">
that of the place where &s;he might tran&s;mit the reward of her &s;ervices, that &s;he meant to &s;end her.</P>
<P>She next &s;tudied all the maps of Germany and Bohemia, which &s;he had in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and having learnt from There&s;a the exact &s;pot in which &s;he then was, &s;he &s;ketched out a kind of route for her&s;elf, as &s;omething of a guide to &s;teer her cour&s;e by. Here There&s;a could be of little u&s;e to her; as her knowledge of the country, except by hear&s;ay, was confined to within a few miles of the place they were in.</P>
<P>Ellen having made all the preparations for her expedition, and taken all the precaution which circum&s;tances would admit of, appointed the next morning for her departure. There&s;a packed a &s;mall ba&s;ket with cold meat and bread, at the bottom of which Ellen put &s;everal trifles, which &s;he thought might po&s;&s;ibly be of comfort or a&s;&s;i&s;tance to her. She made up al&s;o as large a bundle of linen as &s;he could carry with any con|venience, both as a &s;ource of comfort to her&s;elf, and as a means, if all others failed, of procuring food or lodging. She farther provided a pair of &s;hoes, be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;he wore: and being dre&s;&s;ed in her pea&s;ant's dre&s;s, her mandoline flung by her &s;ide, her bundle under one arm, and her ba&s;ket on the other, &s;he quietly de&s;cended the &s;tairs which led from the gallery to the hall, and, accompanied by There&s;a, made the be&s;t of her way to the gar|den. There&s;a ea&s;ily bur&s;t the lock of the door; and Ellen &s;aw her&s;elf at liberty. She turned to embrace her faithful There&s;a, &s;aying, 'Oh, my friend, how &s;hall I ever repay you? Take all I have to give, as an earne&s;t, that, when I have more, I will give more.'</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="036127_0378_100852A4A8BBE6F8">This <HI>all</HI> was a thin plate of gold, in which the picture of her father was &s;et, and which &s;he had loo&s;ened from the picture for this purpo&s;e. It had occurred to her, to make this u&s;e of it during the cour&s;e of the preceding night, as &s;he lay &s;leeple&s;s and di&s;turbed with the thoughts that &s;he &s;hould be obliged to quit There&s;a, without leaving with her any mark of her e&s;teem, or any earne&s;t of what &s;he intended to do for her in future.</P>
<P>There&s;a generou&s;ly declined accepting the gold, urging, that it might be of u&s;e to her: but Ellen felt there was &s;o little difference between actual want and the &s;afeguard which &s;uch a piece of gold would be to her, that no con&s;ideration of this &s;ort could induce her to forego the plea&s;ure &s;he had in leaving &s;ome memorial of her gratitude in the hands of There&s;a. Yet, &s;he afterwards expe|rienced, that gold, even of le&s;s value, was to her of the utmo&s;t importance. But though Ellen could conceive the pre&s;&s;ure of want, &s;he had not yet felt its weight: &s;he therefore forced all the property &s;he was worth upon There&s;a, and again embracing her,</P>

<P>'Oh! Madam,' returned the grateful hearted There&s;a, 'God protect and reward <HI>you. I owe all to you!</HI>'</P>
<P>And with the&s;e memorable words, accompa|nied by a flood of tears, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the hand of Ellen: and after watching her move &s;ome yards from the garden-door, &s;he withdrew, and clo&s;ed it upon her.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was about five o'clock on a glorious morning in the middle of July, that Ellen thus effected her e&s;cape from a captivity which had la&s;ted more than three years, and of which the mi&s;eries had been heightened by a &s;troke of misfortune, which would have &s;hed a gloom over the brighte&s;t days of pro&s;perity. Amid the variety of emotions which &s;welled Ellen's heart, at this affecting mo|ment, fear was a very predominant feeling.</P>
<P>Habit &s;o far triumphed over rea&s;on, as to ex|cite a mo&s;t lively alarm, when &s;he thus found her|&s;elf wholly dependent on her own powers. Un|aided and unprotected, &s;he &s;hrunk from the project &s;he had undertaken. She thought for a moment it was above the &s;trength either of body or mind a&s;&s;igned to her &s;ex, and that it was pre&s;umption to have undertaken it. This was but the thought of a moment. The next &s;he &s;miled at the force of prejudice, and the artificial imbecility, and fal&s;e idea of decorum, induced by cu&s;tom. She con&s;idered, that in the eyes of all who met her, &s;he was only a pea&s;ant; and could therefore nei|ther draw on her&s;elf the gaze of curio&s;ity, nor provoke the ob&s;ervations of impertinence; for
<PB N="168" REF="036127_0380_100852A9117ABF28">
that a <HI>pea&s;ant</HI> &s;hould make u&s;e of her limbs in moving from place to place, unattended and alone, was according to rule, and the <HI>eternal fitne&s;s of things.</HI> To tho&s;e who knew not that her journey extended farther than from her native village to the neighbouring one, there was nothing daring or unfeminine, in being alone; and in fact the whole of her journey was only to con&s;i&s;t of a cer|tain number of &s;uch removals from village to village.</P>
<P>Thus the objections of prejudice were pre|&s;ently &s;ilenced by rea&s;on. But there were yet certain difficulties and contingent dangers, which were but too real, and to &s;upport her&s;elf under both, all her natural force of mind, and undoubting reliance upon the &s;uperintendance of Providence, were no more than ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>She had before her a journey of more than nine hundred miles, without money, without a friend to whom &s;he could make her&s;elf known, without the means of warding off one evil that might attack her. Should her &s;trength fail, or &s;hould illne&s;s &s;eize her, &s;he had not the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of &s;upporting her&s;elf until vigour returned, or until health was re&s;tored. She was to depend upon charity for the mor&s;el nece&s;&s;ary to her daily &s;u&s;tenance, and for her nightly lodging: and from her ignorance of the route &s;he was to take, and the impo&s;&s;ibility &s;he mu&s;t find in calculating her powers of reaching &s;uch places as would af|ford &s;helter, it was but too probable &s;he would frequently find her&s;elf hungry when no food was near, and weary when &s;he knew not where to lay her head. If the public roads expo&s;ed her more to danger, the private paths rendered her more helple&s;s, if danger approached&punc; and to the mo&s;t
<PB N="169" REF="036127_0381_100852ADAA7B36B0">
eligible choice in &s;uch an alternative, no wi&s;dom was adequate. The&s;e, and many &s;uch thoughts as the&s;e, alarmed, but did not depre&s;s the mind of Ellen.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e difficulties and dangers before her, &s;he &s;till thought her&s;elf happy, that &s;he was no longer a pri&s;oner: and if &s;he had been able to pre&s;erve her equanimity in a more calamitous &s;tate, &s;hould it de&s;ert her in a le&s;s. She endea|voured, by rea&s;on, to dive&s;t her &s;ituation of all imaginary terrors, and artificial hard&s;hips, and to collect all the powers of her mind to &s;upport tho&s;e which really accompanied it. She re&s;olved then &s;teadily to proceed; making all po&s;&s;ible u&s;e of her under&s;tanding, her patience, and her cou|rage; but tru&s;ting alone for the happy i&s;&s;ue of her endeavours to that Being, who is the defender of the weak, the &s;upporter of the afflicted, and the enlightener of the ignorant.</P>
<P>It was Ellen's de&s;ign to proceed to Egra, from whence, as nearly as &s;he could calculate, &s;he was &s;omething more than eighty miles. From thence &s;he de&s;igned her route to be to Frankfort, to Co|logne, and through the Low Countries to Hel|voet&s;luys: here &s;he knew &s;he &s;hould find a ready pa&s;&s;age to Harwich: and as to her further pro|ceedings, &s;he left them to be determined by the circum&s;tances which might ari&s;e. At the di&s;tance which &s;he then was from England, it appeared to her, that the moment &s;he &s;et foot on its &s;hores &s;he was at home: and however impo&s;&s;ible &s;he might have thought it in former times, to have found her way into Northumberland from Har|wich, alone, on foot, and pennyle&s;s, &s;he con&s;i|dered that the per&s;on who had found the means under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, with the additional
<PB N="170" REF="036127_0382_100852AF32EA1690">
one of imperfect language, to make her way from the heart of Germany acro&s;s the Engli&s;h channel, was not the one who &s;hould di&s;tre&s;s her mind with the difficulties which might ari&s;e in compa|ratively &s;o &s;hort a pilgrimage.</P>
<P>The morning was gay and cheering. Ellen walked lei&s;urely on: and when the heat of the day induced her to &s;eek for re&s;t, &s;he found a &s;hady covert, through which ran a brook, where, unpacking her ba&s;ket, &s;he indulged in the re|fre&s;hment which the friendly There&s;a had pro|vided&punc; and &s;he quenched her thir&s;t with the wa|ters of the rivulet, which ran at her foot.</P>
<P>Having continued in this &s;ecluded &s;pot till the fervor of the day was pa&s;t, and till her wearied limbs began to feel the invigorating effect of re|fre&s;hment, &s;he again began her journey; and with the &s;ame lei&s;urely pace, happily arrived, as the &s;un was &s;etting, at a &s;mall village. Her know|ledge of the &s;ituation of mo&s;t of the Bohemian villages had induced her, on the &s;ight of a large wood, to quit the public road in &s;earch of one: and her &s;agacity was repaid by finding this, at the moment when &s;he mo&s;t wi&s;hed for &s;uch an a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>Here &s;he was to make the fir&s;t experiment as to the effect which her mu&s;ic would have upon the charitable feelings of the inhabitants. Placing her&s;elf therefore on a little mound of &s;ods, which &s;eemed rai&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of a rural &s;eat, &s;he took up her mandoline, and began a little wild and lively air. Pre&s;ently &s;he found her&s;elf &s;ur|rounded by half a dozen ragged boys and girls. She changed her notes, and &s;et them all dancing. This appearance of gaiety &s;oon drew others to partake of it; the dancers increa&s;ed; and, when|ever they &s;u&s;pended their exerci&s;e, Ellen &s;ung a
<PB N="171" REF="036127_0383_100852B1FA7DBD58">
few lines of a &s;ong, or diver&s;ified their amu&s;e|ment by a change in her mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>She had &s;oon the whole village for auditors: and &s;ingling from among the more elderly part of the company a female, who&s;e countenance &s;he thought promi&s;ed well, &s;he a&s;ked, in Engli&s;h, the favour of a night's lodging. She had not cho&s;en this language from the mo&s;t di&s;tant hope of being un|der&s;tood, but merely to &s;hew that &s;he was a &s;tranger, and to draw on a conver&s;ation, in the cour&s;e of which &s;he thought &s;he might be able to fall upon a method of making her wants known. Luckily, however, for her, among her auditors, there was one of tho&s;e numerous individuals, who travel in large parties from Bohemia all over Europe, loaded with gla&s;&s;es and trinkets of various kinds, and which they &s;ell to &s;o much ad|vantage, that they frequently return with a &s;um &s;ufficient to &s;upport them in affluence the re&s;t of their lives in their native country. This man had, in the cour&s;e of his travels, vi&s;ited England, and knew the &s;ounds which Ellen uttered, were Eng|li&s;h; and with a little clo&s;er attention was able to make out with perfect clearne&s;s the nature of her reque&s;t. He explained it to the woman to whom Ellen had addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf: and it found a ready acquie&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence from the charitable heart of the poor Bohemian farmere&s;s, who was moved with Ellen's &s;weet &s;ounds, and plea&s;ed with the &s;oftne&s;s of her addre&s;s and the civility of her manners. So true it is, that, however vice may have introduced a variety of tongues, the language of virtue is uni|ver&s;al.</P>
<P>Ellen, after thankfully fea&s;ting upon a bowl of milk and bread, was conducted to a &s;traw ma|tra&s;s, covered with a rug, which had nothing
<PB N="172" REF="036127_0384_100852B3912FC7C0">
di&s;gu&s;ting or offen&s;ive in its appearance, and with which Ellen, after having thrown her&s;elf upon the matra&s;s, covered her&s;elf. She flattered her&s;elf, that the fatigues of the day would procure her &s;ome hours of &s;ound &s;leep. But the novelty of her &s;ituation, and the fullne&s;s of her mind, rendered this hope vain. If &s;he clo&s;ed her eyes for a mo|ment, the next &s;he &s;tarted, and awoke in &s;ome fancied danger. Her &s;lumbers were re&s;tle&s;s and feveri&s;h: and &s;he was happy to ri&s;e with the ear|lie&s;t of the friendly hou&s;hold, and after having received a breakfa&s;t &s;imilar to her &s;upper of the night before, and paid for it by another tune upon her mandoline, &s;he pur&s;ued her journey, taking the be&s;t directions, as to her route to Egra, which &s;he was able to procure.</P>
<P>Three days had Ellen thus wandered alone through the woods of Bohemia; and three nights had &s;he received &s;helter and &s;u&s;tenance from its ho&s;pitable inhabitants. The timidity which rea|&s;on could not wholly &s;ubdue, had yielded to time. She no longer thought that the eye of every pa&s;&s;enger was turned upon her. She was con|vinced &s;he was to no one an object of curio&s;ity or wonder. She no longer expected a ruffian to &s;tart from behind every tree: and when &s;he &s;ought a covert wherein to pa&s;s the noon-tide hour, &s;he felt &s;ecure that &s;he &s;hould meet with no in|terruption. Her mind, always alive to the &s;im|ple delights of nature, began to take a plea&s;ure and intere&s;t in the &s;cenes amid&s;t which &s;he wan|dered. She often lingered under the cover of a thick wood, more from the delight &s;he felt in the &s;hade, than any need &s;he had of re&s;t: and &s;he often prolonged her &s;ojourn by the &s;ide of a rip|pling brook, that &s;he might continue &s;oothed by
<PB N="173" REF="036127_0385_100852B51F8D7038">
its murmurs, or from being unable to forego the plea&s;ure of the harmony which re&s;ounded from every branch of the trees with which it was over|&s;hadowed. Often would &s;he compare her pre&s;ent mode of travelling with that to which &s;he had been formerly accu&s;tomed: and her good ta&s;te gave the preference to that which &s;he now pur|&s;ued. Here no impediments from bad roads, no impo&s;itions from inn-keepers, no wrangling with po&s;tillions, no compa&s;&s;ion for the over-loaded and worn-out hor&s;es, aro&s;e to di&s;turb the even tenor of her thoughts, or to &s;poil her reli&s;h of the beau|ties which &s;urrounded her.</P>
<P>But as the ta&s;te of Ellen was genuine, and formed from that love of nature which is the re|&s;ult of good &s;en&s;e and a feeling heart, it was pure from tho&s;e allays of romance, which, while they give a greater currency to what is called ta&s;te, do in fact deba&s;e its e&s;&s;ential qualities. While, therefore, as a matter of feeling, &s;he preferred wandering on foot amid&s;t woods and villages, with no certain path to direct her to the &s;helter &s;he was &s;eeking; &s;he fully acknowledged the more certain comfort of a well-built travelling chai&s;e, drawn even by mi&s;erable po&s;t-hor&s;es, along a road which pre&s;ented no objects but the regu|larly placed mile &s;tones, and tho&s;e po&s;ts of intel|ligence, which &s;o benevolently pre&s;erve the tra|veller from going a&s;tray.</P>
<P>The weather, &s;ince Ellen had begun her pere|grination, had been uncommonly fine; the &s;ky above was &s;erene, the ground beneath dry and firm. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he was well aware what an altera|tion a change of &s;ea&s;ons would make, not only in her comforts, but in the plea&s;ures of her ima|gination:
<PB N="174" REF="036127_0386_1008387C6B48AC58">
and &s;he felt &s;ometimes, with no little pain, that, though wandering in &s;cenes &s;uch as &s;he was in at pre&s;ent, when it was voluntary, and the &s;helter at hand, might be delightful; yet to the weary traveller, who had no option, and no refuge to flee unto, whatever mi&s;chief might betide, it was attended with danger and inconveniencies, from the feelings and fears of which all its plea&s;ures would be mo&s;t readily re|linqui&s;hed. If therefore &s;he were willing and ready to make u&s;e of the amu&s;ements which of|fered them&s;elves on the way, as the means to cheer the melancholy path &s;he was treading, &s;he was not le&s;s de&s;irous to arrive at that haven of re&s;t, when &s;uch alleviations would be no longer wanted.</P>
<P>It was not, however, only from the woods, the birds, and the brooks, that Ellen in this for|lorn &s;ituation derived amu&s;ement to her fancy, or food for reflection. While &s;he marked the extreme poverty of that rank of people with whom &s;he now a&s;&s;ociated, yet &s;aw them tread a &s;oil rich with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> every ble&s;&s;ing which nature could be&s;tow, and which a&s;ked but the hand of labour, working for it&s;elf, to crown them with abundance; how did her heart recoil from the con&s;equences of that feudal tyranny which makes the many &s;ub&s;ervient to the few!</P>
<P>Yet was her pity often checked, and &s;he was led to think it mi&s;placed, when &s;he beheld the cheerful good humour of the people, the happy air of their countenances, and the little &s;en&s;e they &s;eemed to have, of their wants. In the hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s of their &s;tate they &s;eemed to find its con&s;olation. They were at the wor&s;t, and proved how much le&s;s painful it is to &s;uffer, than
<PB N="175" REF="036127_0387_100852BEC7673BB0">
to fear. If the ble&s;&s;ings of free men were beyond their reach, they were equally &s;ecure from tho&s;e ills, the probability of which alarm tho&s;e who have any thing to lo&s;e. The unfruitfulne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons, the deva&s;tations of fire or of war, all were to fall upon their Lord. They were but another part of his property: and evils which did not affect their per&s;ons, were indifferent to them.</P>
<P>'Happine&s;s, then,' &s;aid Ellen, 'is the plant of every &s;oil; &s;ince it will flouri&s;h even in the de|&s;arts of &s;lavery. Who, then, &s;hall deny that the God of <HI>all</HI> is merciful to <HI>all?</HI>'</P>
<P>But Ellen's pre&s;ent &s;ituation called forth re|flections more intere&s;ting to her than any benevo|lence, however warm or extended, or however lively may be the intere&s;t we take in the pains or con&s;olations of others, can produce. She had now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted three days on charity; and the al|ternative for many days to come was &s;tarving. A circum&s;tance to her &s;o new, and in general con|&s;idered as &s;o degrading, could not but fill the re|flecting mind of Ellen with a variety of affecting thoughts. The very people whom the tenderne&s;s of her heart led her to pity, con&s;idered her as one degree below them&s;elves, in the &s;cale of human happine&s;s: and from the very poverty which &s;he regarded with &s;o much compa&s;&s;ion, &s;he received a boon, without which &s;he mu&s;t have peri&s;hed. But, though thrown from her rank in &s;ociety, Ellen con&s;idered her&s;elf not the le&s;s as maintaining her &s;tation in animated nature. She was &s;till one of tho&s;e beings who are placed only lower than the angels, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd who, in the eye of Providence, are all equal. Whatever di&s;tre&s;s, therefore, &s;he felt from the ungratified wants of cold and hun|ger, it was unembittered by any &s;entiment of
<PB N="176" REF="036127_0388_100852C08A842768">
wounded pride. She con&s;idered it not as any de|ba&s;ement to be reduced to a &s;tate in which a God, who is con&s;iderate alike of all his creatures, has &s;een good to place &s;o large a part of them: and it was with equal gratitude to that God, and equal elevation of mind, though certainly not with an equal degree of happine&s;s, that &s;he now &s;tretched forth her hand to receive, as &s;he had before extended it to give. Are we not all alike children of God's mercy, thought &s;he&mdash;and &s;hall we conceive there is greater dignity annexed to receiving it through one medium than another? On &s;ome he be&s;tows his alms by the means of parental inheritance. He gives it to others as the price of their per&s;onal labours: but they are not the le&s;s ab&s;olute dependants on his daily bounty, than tho&s;e whom he appoints the ravens to feed. &mdash;He has ordained my pre&s;ent &s;u&s;tenance to flow from the charity of my fellow creatures. Let me &s;erve him, in receiving, as they &s;erve him in giving. The greater ble&s;&s;ing has been mine. It may be mine again. But in the mean while, let me not grudge it to tho&s;e, to whom, in the pre|&s;ent moment, God has granted it.</P>
<P>How much &s;o ju&s;t and yet &s;o uncommon a manner of thinking, contributed to the internal peace of Ellen, in her pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;sful circum|&s;tances, may be known by tho&s;e who have expe|rienced all the pangs a contrary way of rea&s;oning can inflict; who, in the lo&s;s of every thing that con&s;titutes human happine&s;s, have breathed their <HI>bittere&s;t</HI> &s;ighs, from the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>&s;hame,</HI> which they fal&s;ely imagined to be annexed to a fall from affluence to poverty. But, if there be no &s;hame in being <HI>born</HI> poor, how can there be any, where the change is independent of guilt in <HI>becoming</HI> &s;o?
<PB N="177" REF="036127_0389_100852C2673425E8">
If there be no &s;hame in poverty, innocently in|curred, can there be any in receiving the relief which poverty requires?&mdash;Can what is the virtue of our fellow creatures be our degradation?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of the fourth day of Ellen's wanderings, &s;he began, as u&s;ual, to look around her for tho&s;e appearances in the country which generally indicated where a village was to be found. She looked but without di&s;covering any thing that gave her rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he &s;hould find what &s;he &s;ought.</P>
<P>She was ju&s;t emerged from a thick wood, and had entered upon a kind of heath, which, from its extent and drearine&s;s, pre&s;ented her with an uncomfortable and alarming pro&s;pect. No mark of human habitation, no mark of &s;helter of any &s;ort, was to be &s;een. She mu&s;t either cro&s;s the heath before her, in pur&s;uit of the refuge &s;he wanted; and to do this would take up a con&s;i|derable time; or &s;he mu&s;t return into the wood, which &s;he had ju&s;t left, and there take up her abode for the night. Her fears forbade the one; and her wearine&s;s, &s;he thought, almo&s;t made the other impo&s;&s;ible. Terror, however, was, for the moment, more prevalent than fatigue; and &s;he re&s;olved to attempt to cro&s;s the heath. She had &s;till &s;ome day-light: and &s;he con&s;idered, that &s;hould &s;he arrive too late in a village to find admittance into any hou&s;e, yet that the &s;helter which &s;ome out building, or &s;hed, might afford her, was pre|ferable,
<PB N="179" REF="036127_0391_100852CAA514E798">
on many accounts, to any which &s;he could hope for in the wood.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;et forward accordingly: but the wild &s;eemed to lengthen as &s;he went: and &s;he became &s;o fatigued that &s;he could hardly proceed. To &s;top, however, was what &s;he could not re&s;olve upon. The evening was dark and louring, and, for the &s;ea&s;on of the year, cold: and while &s;he could move her limbs, &s;he could not con&s;ent to lie down upon the bare and hard ground, without a twig to &s;helter her, and expo&s;ed to all the rain and &s;torm which &s;eemed gathering. With &s;low &s;teps &s;he went on, and at length reached the other &s;ide of the heath. She found it bounded al&s;o by a wood, but not &s;o uninterruptedly thick, as that which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed through before her entrance on the heath. The evening was already too dark to enable her to di&s;tingui&s;h with certainty: but there appeared as if there had been once roads cut through the wood, though they &s;eemed now nearly grown up, and the &s;pot where &s;he then was, &s;he thought was the entrance of an avenue. Fa|tigued as &s;he was, this thought gave her power to proceed. She flattered her&s;elf that it might lead at lea&s;t to &s;ome ruined building, where, at the wor&s;t, a jutting cornice, or projecting wall, 'ju&s;t nodding to its fall,' might afford her &s;ome &s;helter from the rain, which now began, at in|tervals, to fall very heavily, accompanied with loud and &s;udden gu&s;ts of wind; nor was the con|jecture ill founded. After about half an hour's walking, in which time all her outward garments were completely wet through, &s;he found her&s;elf among the intricacies of &s;ome building, which &s;he took for the cloi&s;ters of a decayed mona&s;tery. She troubled her&s;elf, however, but little in a&s;certaining
<PB N="180" REF="036127_0392_10085388EBB2A158">
whether &s;he were right or wrong. There was too little light to enable her to di&s;cover the truth, if it had been important to her to have known it: but the mo&s;t momentous concern was to find out &s;ome place where &s;he could re&s;t her weary limbs unexpo&s;ed to the weather. As the roof of that part of the building which &s;he then was in, was not de&s;troyed, &s;he withdrew to the upper end of it: and there, taking off &s;uch of her clothes, as were mo&s;t wet, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf upon a kind of &s;tone bench, and began to examine her ba&s;ket for &s;omething to eat. Luckily it was tolerably &s;upplied. She had that morning been &s;o much moved by the want of linen in the dre&s;s of the good farmere&s;s, who had lodged her the night be|fore, that &s;he had not been able to forbear, when they parted, pre&s;enting her with a chemi&s;e of her own; though this was contrary to the prudential rule &s;he had laid down, not to part, in a country where &s;he could &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;charge her bill with a &s;ong, with what, in another, who&s;e greater riches had bani&s;hed equal ho&s;pitality, &s;he might find ne|ce&s;&s;ary to her &s;upport.</P>
<P>The woman was &s;o much &s;truck with this un|expected piece of genero&s;ity in Ellen, that &s;he loaded her with a thick &s;lice of bread, and a &s;mall bottle of milk. Ellen having found equal mu|nificence where &s;he had &s;ought a dinner, had pre&s;erved her morning &s;tore untouched: and &s;he now found it a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable relief. Hungry and fatigued, however, as &s;he was, &s;he prudently con&s;umed only half of her riches, pre&s;erving the remainder for the exigencies of the next day. In part, however, &s;he &s;upplied the deficiencies of her &s;canty meal by &s;wallowing a few drops upon a lump of &s;ugar, &s;he having had the precaution to
<PB N="181" REF="036127_0393_1008388A170CDD18">
furni&s;h her&s;elf with &s;uch a cordial, upon leaving the place of her captivity.</P>
<P>Having taken all the refre&s;hment which &s;he thought it prudent to allow her&s;elf, &s;he lay down to &s;leep: and though the floor on which &s;he &s;tretched her&s;elf, was hard and damp, and her pillow only her bundle of linen, &s;uch was the fa|tigue of her body, and &s;uch the calmne&s;s of her mind, that in a few moments &s;he fell a&s;leep. She knew not how long &s;he had continued in this &s;i|tuation, when &s;he was &s;uddenly awakened, by &s;ome noi&s;e. She &s;tarted up, and looked around her, when, to her un&s;peakable terror, &s;he beheld by the glimmering of a light, not a hundred yards di&s;tant, two men carrying a lady, who, by her helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, appeared to be dead.</P>
<P>Ellen's heart did not at this moment beat with its u&s;ual regularity: yet her pre&s;ence of mind did not de&s;ert her: and con&s;idering that though the light enabled her to di&s;cover the objects which were clo&s;e to it, it was not &s;ufficient to di&s;cover her to them in the di&s;tant and dark corner where &s;he lay. She &s;lipped as quietly as &s;he could, be|hind a pillar which formed the place where &s;he was, into &s;omething of a rece&s;s; and waited the event in &s;ilence. The men bearing their burden between them, advanced nearer: and Ellen was &s;omething comforted by under&s;tanding from the expre&s;&s;ions of one of them, who &s;poke in French, the deepe&s;t marks of grief for the &s;ituation of the lady. He could not, &s;urely, (&s;he thought) be the murderer of one, whom he &s;o much deplored: yet, on laying her down, &s;carcely ten yards from the place where Ellen &s;tood, and the light &s;hining full upon her, Ellen ob&s;erved that her clothes were &s;tained with blood: and &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw the
<PB N="182" REF="036127_0394_100838935BE82658">
blood &s;till i&s;&s;uing from her bo&s;om, which, from the di&s;order of her dre&s;s, was very vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>'What will become of me?' (exclaimed the man, who was the only one who had yet &s;poken) 'wretched Antoinette! deare&s;t creature! How have you rea&s;on to cur&s;e the hour in which you &s;aw me!'</P>
<P>The&s;e words determined Ellen. She was a&s;|&s;ured there was no danger: but there was di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he might be of u&s;e. Coming out, therefore, ha&s;tily from her hiding-place, &s;he cau&s;ed little le&s;s con&s;ternation by her appearance, than &s;he had felt upon being fir&s;t &s;tartled from her &s;leep. 'Su&s;pend your wonder,' &s;aid &s;he in French, to the per&s;on who &s;eemed mo&s;t intere&s;ted, and whom &s;he now di&s;covered to be a gentleman, and the other man appeared a &s;ervant, '&s;u&s;pend your wonder, and do not fear that I have any connec|tions that may injure you. I am alone here: but perhaps I have the means to a&s;&s;i&s;t that lady: and I am &s;ure I have the inclination.' A ready con|fidence took place of the &s;u&s;picions which had for a moment alarmed the brea&s;t of the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>'Alas!' cried he, 'I can only thank you: but I fear, this mi&s;erable victim of mi&s;guided revenge, is pa&s;t all a&s;&s;i&s;tance.'</P>
<P>Ellen &s;carcely waited to hear the&s;e words. She now &s;aw that the lady was really wounded: and &s;he &s;eemed to have fainted from lo&s;s of blood. But though the trace of the blood &s;till &s;hewed whence it had flowed, it was now &s;taunched. The light enabled Ellen to di&s;cern, that the place they were in was, as &s;he had &s;u&s;pected, the ruins of a cloi&s;ter: and it formed one &s;ide of a qua|drangle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he buildings of the other three &s;ides of which were nearly de&s;troyed. In the mid&s;t of
<PB N="183" REF="036127_0395_100852CC687FD7F8">
this &s;quare, had formerly been a fountain, and, though ruined, it &s;till contained water. Ellen ran thither: and filling a &s;mall cup which &s;he carried about her, with water, &s;he wa&s;hed the lady's wound; and had the &s;atisfaction to find it was &s;mall, and did not appear to be deep. She then cut a large piece of a kind of &s;ticking pla&s;ter, which made a part of her &s;tores, and covered the wound with it: and then mixing a little of the water with &s;ome of her cordial drops, &s;he con|trived, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;tranger, who aided her benevolent efforts with the greate&s;t a&s;|&s;iduity, to pour a &s;mall quantity down her throat. She then proceeded to cha&s;e her temples, and rub her hands: and in a &s;hort time &s;he was encouraged to continue her endeavours wit &s;till greater energy, by the lady giving evident &s;igns of her returning life. In a few moments, &s;he opened her eyes. Ellen gave her more cordial: and in a very &s;hort time, &s;he recovered her &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>While this was pa&s;&s;ing, the &s;ervant, at Ellen's &s;ugge&s;tion, (for the &s;tranger, though he imitated and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in all &s;he did, &s;eemed to have lo&s;t the power of &s;ugge&s;ting any thing) had been fully employed in collecting a few dry &s;ticks, which was a ta&s;k of &s;ome difficulty: for the rain of the pre|ceding night had left nothing in a fit condition to burn, which had been expo&s;ed to it. Luckily however, in his re&s;earches, he di&s;covered &s;everal bundles of dry bru&s;h wood, and branches of trees, which had been heaped together in one corner of the cloi&s;ter, probably by &s;ome pea&s;ant, who de|&s;igned to carry them away at &s;ome future oppor|tunity. Of the&s;e he &s;oon &s;et fire to a &s;ufficient quantity to afford the comfort both of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight and heat. The lady was removed nearer to it, and
<PB N="184" REF="036127_0396_100852D0321D1DE8">
farther from the influence of the air, which blew cold on the open &s;ide of the building. The lady's clothes were wet: and Ellen had no change to offer her. However &s;he took off her upper gar|ments, as &s;he had done her own, and &s;pread them all before the fire, while &s;he furni&s;hed her with &s;ome linen from her bundle, which &s;upplied, though but ill, their place.</P>
<P>While Ellen performed the ta&s;k of dre&s;&s;ing and undre&s;&s;ing the lady, the two men had retired, but not before the one, who &s;eemed the ma&s;ter of the other, had a&s;&s;ured the lady, in German, that &s;he might tru&s;t wholly to Ellen, for that, if ever there were an angel from heaven, &s;he was one. The lady her&s;elf appeared &s;o weak, and &s;o confounded, either with what &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed through, or with what &s;he now &s;aw around her, that &s;he could utter nothing more than a few broken expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, in German, and &s;ometimes &s;ome pa&s;&s;ionate exclamations, in a lan|guage which Ellen did not at all under&s;tand. Ellen had now an opportunity of ob&s;erving, that this unknown lady was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very uncom|mon &s;hare of beauty; that her form was inex|pre&s;&s;ibly fine; and that, notwith&s;tanding her pale|ne&s;s and languor, her complexion and counte|nance had charms which Ellen thought &s;he had not &s;een equalled. Her dre&s;s, which was a kind of travelling chemi&s;e, &s;poke her of affluent for|tune; all the materials of which it was compo&s;ed being of the fine&s;t texture: and the air of con&s;cious &s;uperiority, with which &s;he received the &s;ervices of Ellen, if it did not give her kind benefactor a favourable opinion of her heart, at lea&s;t a&s;|&s;ured her, that &s;he was a&s;&s;i&s;ting one, who, from the habit of command, entertained the idea,
<PB N="185" REF="036127_0397_100852D4974EFAE0">
that all who approached her were bound to obey.</P>
<P>When Ellen had contributed all in her power towards re&s;toring her to &s;ome degree of comfort, &s;he produced the remains of her &s;upper, &s;pared &s;o prudently from her own pre&s;ent wants, in refer|ence to tho&s;e of the next morning. The lady rea|dily ate the bread and &s;wallowed the milk; and ap|peared &s;o much revived by the refre&s;hment they af|forded, and &s;o fully re&s;tored to health and vigour, that Ellen &s;oon found &s;he had been mi&s;taken in having attributed the &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, in which &s;he had at fir&s;t &s;een her, to lo&s;s of blood: from what now appeared, it &s;eemed more probable that it had only proceeded from fatigue.</P>

<P>IT was upon the return of the gentleman to the fire that Ellen had fir&s;t lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve him with any clo&s;ene&s;s of attention. She had no &s;ooner done &s;o, than &s;he was convinced that &s;he had &s;een him before: and being per&s;uaded by his manner of &s;peaking both French and German, that he was not a native either of France or Ger|many, an opinion which was confirmed both by his countenance and complexion, &s;he could not doubt but that he was Engli&s;h. She made this di&s;covery with a mingled &s;en&s;ation of hope and fear. Again &s;he looked at him, again &s;he li&s;tened to the tone of his voice. She was more and more convinced that he was not unknown to her: but it &s;eemed beyond the power of her recollection to recal his name, or where &s;he had &s;een him. Sud|denly, on his throwing him&s;elf into a particular po&s;ition, it ru&s;hed upon her mind, that he was the hu&s;band of her elder &s;i&s;ter, that profligate man of fa&s;hion and broken fortune, to whom the ab&s;urd vanity of her mother had &s;acrificed the happine&s;s and re&s;pectability of character of her favourite child. This di&s;covery, though the &s;trangene&s;s of it threw her into &s;ome confu&s;ion, relieved her from every fear that &s;he &s;hould be

known by him. Ellen had never &s;een him &s;ince &s;he was fourteen, when he had vi&s;ited Groby Manor, for the only time during his connexion with any one belonging to it. She was very &s;ure that the change which had taken place in her per&s;on in a period little &s;hort of twelve years, mu&s;t &s;ecurely &s;helter her from any di&s;covery from him: for while time had made no other changes in his appearance than what aro&s;e from a few wrinkles, or a few grey hairs in the place of the darker locks, and &s;moother &s;kin, which he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in earlier youth; it had with her converted a ro&s;y, &s;un-burnt, romping, laughing girl, into an ele|gantly-formed woman, who&s;e pure red and white mo&s;t truly blended, &s;hewed in her check, as if the ro&s;e and lily &s;trove for ma&s;tery. All gaiety was certainly at this time bani&s;hed from her coun|tenance: and her large pea&s;ant's &s;traw hat, which &s;he had now again tied clo&s;ely under her chin, &s;o effectually concealed her features, that, if they had been much better known to Mr. Raymond than they really were, &s;he mu&s;t have been &s;afe from awakening any recollection in him.</P>
<P>As hopele&s;s as &s;he knew his return to Eng|land was con&s;idered by all his connexions there, and the little probable good which would re&s;ult if he were to return, yet &s;he could not avoid being &s;hocked at the proof &s;he had before her, of the licentious life he continued to lead; nor could &s;he help pitying the lady, little conciliating as her manners were, for having formed a connexion, the extent of the iniquity of which &s;he thought it probable &s;he did not know.</P>
<P>While the&s;e thoughts kept Ellen &s;ilent, the lady and gentleman, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ervant upon &s;ome me&s;&s;age, continued to talk eagerly, and,
<PB N="188" REF="036127_0400_100852D9F5277BA0">
confident in the fancied ignorance of Ellen in the German language, or carele&s;s of her opinion, un|re&s;ervedly of their affairs and &s;ituation. From this conver&s;ation &s;he &s;oon under&s;tood, that the lady was by no means de&s;erving of her pity, on the &s;core &s;he had granted it; for that &s;he was her&s;elf a fugitive wife, and that having been overtaken in the pur&s;uit made after her by her hu&s;band, an affray had en&s;ued; and &s;he had re|ceived a wound in attempting to interpo&s;e be|tween her hu&s;band and her lover, the latter of whom, becoming de&s;perate on &s;eeing her blood flow, had fired at the hu&s;band; and, as he &s;up|po&s;ed had killed him. This act of violence, with the farther acts of outrage he and his attendants were on the point of committing, had &s;o intimi|dated the companions of the hu&s;band, that they had contented them&s;elves with carrying off his body, without making any farther attempt to im|pede the flight of the lovers. The lady having fainted from pain and terror, and it being no longer &s;afe to continue in any high road, the lover had been obliged to convey her before him on hor&s;eback, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all his attendants ex|cepting one.</P>
<P>It appeared, from what Ellen heard, that, in the cour&s;e of a journey of more than twelve miles acro&s;s a country, of which they were ignorant, it had been impo&s;&s;ible to afford her re&s;t or refre&s;h|ment; that &s;he had returned to her &s;en&s;es only to relap&s;e again into in&s;en&s;ibility; &s;o that the lover had more than once believed her dead. This was an additional circum&s;tance, which had for|bidden him to &s;top at any hou&s;e: and he had con|tinued to travel on, in hopes of finding &s;ome ob|&s;cure and de&s;erted building, &s;uch not being very
<PB N="189" REF="036127_0401_100852DFB2A59B50">
unfrequent in a country once much more popu|lous than at pre&s;ent, where he might in &s;afety con|&s;ider upon the cour&s;e he had to pur&s;ue. Having pa&s;&s;ed through the out&s;kirts of a tolerably large village, toward the clo&s;e of the evening, he had &s;ent his &s;ervant to procure the means of &s;triking a light, in whatever place they might find it eligible, or might be obliged to &s;top. It was in pur&s;uit of &s;ome refre&s;hment, that Ellen found the &s;ervant was now di&s;patched: and the lovers &s;eemed to agree, that if they &s;aw no rea&s;on again&s;t it in the morning, the place they were at pre&s;ent in, would &s;uit as well as any other, as a place of re|fuge for a few days. They had no doubt but that the pur&s;uit would be renewed with redoubled ardour: and they agreed, that their be&s;t hope of &s;afety was to remain where they were, till their pur&s;uers had over&s;hot their mark.</P>
<P>Hitherto they were &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by their own concerns, that they &s;eemed to have forgotten there was &s;uch a per&s;on in the world as Ellen: but Mr. Raymond now addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to her, hoping, although he did not, from the circum|&s;tance of her &s;peaking French, take her to be a native of the country, that he might be able to obtain, through her means, &s;ome local informa|tion. He therefore enquired whether her home was near. Ellen replied, that at pre&s;ent &s;he had no home, but was endeavouring to make her way towards a very di&s;tant one. 'In France?" 'No.' 'In Germany?' 'No.' 'In England?' 'Yes.' 'What the devil!" exclaimed in Engli&s;h, the profligate Mr. Raymond, 'can then have brought you into the mid&s;t of a Bohemian wild, alone and de&s;titute?' 'Misfortune!' &s;aid Ellen, &s;teadily
<PB N="190" REF="036127_0402_100852E14DDBD230">
fixing her eye upon him, "Misfortune, but not vice!'</P>
<P>The con&s;cious criminal &s;eemed to &s;hrink into him&s;elf; but rallying, 'And how, my pretty one, do you mean to find your way from hence to England, in your pre&s;ent helple&s;s circum&s;tances?' 'By making the be&s;t u&s;e I can of my under&s;tand|ing and my &s;trength.' 'A brave girl, faith. If I were not ju&s;t now a little encumbered, I would enli&s;t you under my banner. I am charmed with your &s;pirit.' 'Your pardon, &s;ir,' &s;aid Ellen with calm di&s;dain, 'I am not &s;o &s;oon enli&s;ted.' 'Oh! you would go with me. My road through life has been the path of plea&s;ure. I have lived but to amu&s;e my&s;elf. But, put a&s;ide that over&s;hadowing hat, and let me &s;ee whether the face is worthy of the form, and the &s;pirit that enlivens it.' Ellen without ever &s;eeming to hear the&s;e words, turned to the lady, and a&s;ked in her imperfect German, whether there were any thing &s;he could do towards her farther accommodation. The lady &s;omething &s;ullenly replied, 'No.' And the gentleman &s;aid, &s;till &s;peaking in Engli&s;h, 'You under&s;tand Ger|man then?' 'Scarcely,' returned Ellen. 'E|nough, perhaps, to know what we have been talking of: and if &s;o, you may as well know the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. I believe you will not turn in|former.'</P>
<P>Ellen was &s;ilent; for &s;he felt little curio&s;ity to know more of an affair which &s;eemed a compli|cated ti&s;&s;ue of profligacy and de&s;peration. Mr. Raymond, however, who thought the circum|&s;tances he had to bring forward offered a very rea&s;onable apology for an action which, he could not conceal from him&s;elf, would be condemned by the general voice of mankind, did not de&s;i&s;t
<PB N="191" REF="036127_0403_100852E5E03DC4D8">
from his explanation. 'That angel whom you &s;ee there,' &s;aid he, looking at the lady, 'is the daughter of a bea&s;t of an Hungarian nobleman, who, to fulfil &s;ome ambitious &s;chemes of his own, forced her into the arms of an old di&s;agreeable ra&s;cal in high favour with the emperor. What mu&s;t a woman of feeling and &s;pirit do in &s;uch a ca&s;e? Surely not &s;ubmit to all the horrors of the wor&s;t kind of &s;lavery, becau&s;e her tyrant was yclept a hu&s;band. I was the happy man, whom the lady fixed upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t in breaking her chains: and with a liberality of mind for which I &s;hall ever adore her, &s;he committed her&s;elf to my honour, loaded with all the jewels and ready ca&s;h which &s;he could collect: and though, at pre&s;ent, we are put &s;omething out of our way, we hope &s;till to find &s;ome &s;acred &s;pot of earth, where the plea&s;ures of love and the fruits of genero&s;ity may be reaped, undi&s;turbed by the imagined rights of hu&s;bands and the abu&s;ed authority of parents.'</P>
<P>Ellen could not but wonder at the ingenuity that had been able to tell a &s;tory of di&s;obedience, treachery, adultery, and theft, in terms, which on the fir&s;t hearing, &s;o little conveyed the nature of the actions they acknowledged. Mr. Raymond was &s;o little con&s;cious that they conveyed it at all, that, without any of that embarra&s;&s;ment which a per&s;on le&s;s hackneyed in the <HI>path of plea&s;ure</HI> (as he had called the road of vice) mu&s;t have felt in con|&s;equence of &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion, that he went on to &s;ay, that having taken what they hoped would have proved effectual methods to mi&s;lead the hu&s;|band into a belief that they had, on leaving Vienna, turned their fugitive cour&s;e towards Italy, they had indi&s;creetly neglected to make the be&s;t of their way towards Dre&s;den, from the direct
<PB N="192" REF="036127_0404_100852E88EAE7FC8">
road to which place they had deviated as a mean; of farther &s;ecurity; and that they had, the day before, been overtaken, at a moment when they conceived them&s;elves in perfect &s;afety. He then proceeded to detail the whole particulars of the affray which had en&s;ued, and to relate, that when he found him&s;elf in danger of being pur&s;ued, not only as a ravi&s;her, but as a murderer, he had &s;ent forward their carriage and their baggage, under the care of a &s;ervant, in whom he could confide, to Dre&s;den, there to wait his farther orders; and in the mean time to &s;pread a &s;tory, that the lady was dead, and his ma&s;ter gone, he knew not whither; that in the ha&s;te, in which they were obliged to make their arrangements, they had not been able to &s;ecure any part of their property, except the lady's jewels, which were in her pocket, and what little money they had about them. 'And now,' &s;aid this gallant hero of a &s;tory com|po&s;ed of crimes, which, more than any other in the whole roll of guilt, are, from their own na|ture, and the injurious effects they have upon the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, the ju&s;t objects of the greate&s;t abhorrence; 'and now, if fortune will but &s;mile for a few days, we may &s;till baffle the malice of our enemies. My intention is, to or|der the &s;ervant I have &s;ent to Dre&s;den to join us as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, at Stra&s;burg, from whence we will &s;hape our cour&s;e to &s;ome more dear retreat in the mountains of Switzerland, and there,
<Q>'The world forgetting, by the world forgot,'</Q>
we will remain alive only to love and happine&s;s.' Love and happine&s;s! thought Ellen, how widely have I been mi&s;taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the means and the end of all that makes life de&s;irable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e mi&s;e|rables are right!</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="036127_0405_100852EBC0599980">It was ea&s;y to be perceived, that this long di&s;|cour&s;e of her lover, in a language of which &s;he did not under&s;tand a word, was by no means plea&s;|ing to the lady. She broke in upon it by &s;ome|thing which &s;he &s;aid very peevi&s;hly to him, and which Ellen did not perfectly under&s;tand. Ellen now began to wi&s;h impatiently for the morning, that &s;he might e&s;cape from the con&s;equences of a proof &s;o pregnant, how infinitely preferable the mo&s;t helple&s;s &s;olitude may be, to much of the &s;o|ciety that is to be met with in the world. Yet how often had &s;he heard Mr. Raymond exalted as the mo&s;t plea&s;ant of his &s;ex! how often had &s;he heard Mrs. Mordaunt declare, that he had not a fault but in the eyes of tho&s;e rigid mortals who hold plea&s;ure as a vice, who refu&s;e to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings which are given them, and who &s;eek heaven by aba&s;ing the noble&s;t of its works! Alas! thought Ellen, how fatally would he have been awakened from the fal&s;e peace into which his flatterers have lulled him, had not the ra&s;h pa&s;&s;ion of his unworthy companion interpo&s;ed between his life and the ju&s;t indignation of an injured hu&s;|band!</P>
<P>Light, at the &s;ea&s;on of the year when the&s;e events happened, is &s;u&s;pended for &s;o &s;hort a time, that had it not been for the &s;torms of the preced|ing evening, which &s;till filled the &s;ky with thick and heavy clouds, Ellen would have been very &s;oon able to have pur&s;ued her wi&s;hes of quitting her new acquaintance. But the fir&s;t hours of the morning were dark; and it continued to rain in &s;ome degree. Before the&s;e ob&s;tacles to her de|parture were removed, the &s;ervant returned with a quantity of milk and bread, which he had pur|cha&s;ed at a village a few miles di&s;tant. Ellen was
<PB N="194" REF="036127_0406_100852EED3533460">
invited to partake of this refre&s;hment, which, in fact, &s;he wanted as much as any of the party: and in the cour&s;e of the meal, Mr. Raymond, who really did po&s;&s;e&s;s a part of that kindne&s;s of human nature, which had gained him the appel|lation of 'the be&s;t-humoured fellow breathing,' expre&s;&s;ed much genuine &s;olicitude for the de&s;ti|tute &s;ituation Ellen appeared to be in. He felt this the more, as, though he could draw nothing from her to confirm &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, he was &s;trongly per&s;uaded, in his own mind, that &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to a rank of life, which could not have prepared her to &s;truggle with her pre|&s;ent difficulties. Although &s;he had been very &s;paring of her &s;peech, her accent, her manner of expre&s;&s;ion, and tone of voice, all a&s;&s;ured him of this, and &s;till more the ea&s;e and &s;oftne&s;s of her manners. He &s;ettled in his own mind her pro|bable &s;tory to be, that, having left her own coun|try as an occa&s;ional companion to a per&s;on of his own principles, but who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed le&s;s of that compa&s;&s;ionate good humour for which he had been often complimented, and upon which he piqued him&s;elf, &s;he had, by the change of incli|nation, and want of genero&s;ity in her companion, been reduced to her pre&s;ent difficulties. There was &s;omething, indeed, in the nice &s;en&s;e of pro|priety which &s;he appeared to have, and which was evident even to one who had lo&s;t all &s;uch feelings from his own mind, which militated again&s;t this idea. But as it was &s;omething beyond mea&s;ure &s;trange, that a per&s;on of real fa&s;hion and character could be left by any, the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing occurrences, in the &s;ituation Ellen was now in. He thought it was taking the le&s;s improbable &s;ide, to &s;uppo&s;e, that her former way of life had
<PB N="195" REF="036127_0407_100852F05C2B8088">
not entirely obliterated all traces of tho&s;e feelings which once adorned her &s;tate of innocence. This &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ituation of Ellen did not in the lea&s;t make her a le&s;s intere&s;ting, or even le&s;s e&s;timable object in the eyes of Mr. Raymond: and he even felt &s;omething of an additional de&s;ire to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, from the proof &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance would be to all his acquaintance, that there is &s;ometimes a &s;entiment of kindne&s;s in the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e called wicked, towards the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, which the more rigidly virtuous are without. In con&s;equence of the&s;e reflections, Mr. Raymond began to pre&s;s Ellen to attach her&s;elf to their party; and hinted, in pretty intelligible terms, that be&s;ides all the difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es which would probably attend her finding her way back to England, &s;he would find it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering the circum&s;tan|ces in which &s;he would arrive there, to form any eligible e&s;tabli&s;hment. Whereas he had no doubt, if &s;he &s;taid with them, that he &s;hould &s;oon be able to introduce her to a friend, who would make her forget all &s;he had lo&s;t. Although all this would have been perfectly plain to the apprehen|&s;ion of Ellen, had &s;he been the &s;ort of per&s;on Mr. Raymond took her to be, yet being entirely ignorant of all that could lead her to his true meaning, and much of what he &s;aid applying to her real &s;ituation, &s;he at fir&s;t under&s;tood his of|fers only in a general &s;en&s;e: and when, by the turn and &s;trength of the expre&s;&s;ions, &s;he began to comprehend that there mu&s;t be &s;ome particular meaning intended to be conveyed, &s;he was ab&s;o|lutely at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s what that meaning could be. The character of the man who addre&s;&s;ed her and the manner of his expre&s;&s;ions, however, per&s;uaded her, there was &s;omething di&s;graceful
<PB N="196" REF="036127_0408_100852F1ED14C968">
in the protection he offered her: and as &s;he was too wi&s;e to think of &s;hewing her re&s;entment, &s;he contented her&s;elf with coldly and &s;teadily &s;aying, &s;he was indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to endeavour to re|turn to England, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and that when there, &s;he was a&s;&s;ured &s;he &s;hould want nei|ther protection nor friends, The unmoved man|ner of Ellen, and the little countenance that the lady gave to this plan of Mr. Raymond's, at length obliged him to cea&s;e from further urging it. And &s;oon after, the &s;un breaking forth in all his &s;plendour, Ellen repacking the bundle, and re-adju&s;ting her ba&s;ket, ro&s;e to depart. 'We cannot &s;uffer you to go,' &s;aid Mr. Raymond, 'without making a &s;mall acknowledgment for the obligations we are under to you. If you would have gone with us, I would have done much for you: but now, &s;o low are our finances reduced, that, except our jewels, I equally divide the whole of our &s;tock, when I offer you this tri|fle.' In &s;aying the&s;e words, he pre&s;ented Ellen with a ducat. Ellen's fir&s;t impul&s;e was to refu&s;e it, &s;o far did habit make her forgetful of the ap|pearance &s;he then wore. But Mr. Raymond added, 'No, no,&mdash;no refu&s;als&mdash;while you ram|ble among&s;t the&s;e wilds indeed, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e charity of the&s;e half &s;avages may make money needle&s;s: but when you are among the whole &s;avages of a civilized world, you will have nothing but what you can pay for.'</P>
<P>Ellen then took the ducat. But Mr. Raymond, who felt his &s;olicitude increa&s;e for her every mo|ment, in &s;pite of, or perhaps &s;timulated by, her re&s;erve and coldne&s;s, &s;aid, 'Devil take me, if I am not a&s;hamed to part &s;o. Stay; would it not be po&s;&s;ible to convey you a bill to Cologne? Do
<PB N="197" REF="036127_0409_100852F735EBB600">
you mean to take Cologne in your way?' Ellen re|plied &s;he did. 'The moment we think it &s;afe to quit this retreat,' &s;aid he, we &s;hall bend our &s;teps towards Stra&s;burg. We &s;hall be there in much le&s;s time than your poor little feet can carry you to Cologne. Come, give me your directions: and at La Savage you &s;hall be &s;ure of finding, on your arrival in that place, a bill for a &s;um &s;ufficient to procure you an ea&s;y conveyance to England, and to any part of it to which you may choo&s;e to go.' Ellen he&s;itated. The performance of &s;uch an offer would annihilate half tho&s;e difficulties and dangers which &s;he dreaded &s;o much to encounter. 'Such a &s;upply,' returned Ellen, 'would indeed be extremely acceptable to me. But as, on my return to England, I &s;hall be perfectly able to re|turn any pecuniary obligations I may receive, I cannot accept your offer, however grateful I may be for it, except you will put me in &s;ome method of repaying the money, when I no longer &s;tand in need of it.' Mr. Raymond regarded her with increa&s;ed wonder. 'I would give the world to know who you are,' &s;aid he, 'and what has brought you into this de&s;art; for I am confident you are no common one.' 'You &s;hall know who I am,' returned Ellen, 'and all I have under|gone, when I return you the money: and then you will acknowledge that the human mind may &s;upport any de&s;tiny, however hard, which has not been brought on by mi&s;conduct.' 'I believe you are a par&s;on in petticoats,' &s;aid Mr. Raymond. 'No,' returned Ellen, 'I am no par&s;on; but I am a kind of a prophete&s;s: and I foretel that you will never know happine&s;s until you return to your wife and children.' Mr. Raymond retreated a
<PB N="198" REF="036127_0410_100852FA012BBA78">
few &s;teps, as if he recoiled from a dread of &s;u|pernatural power. 'I &s;aid, when fir&s;t I &s;aw you, you were an angel: but now I believe you deal with the devil.' 'You &s;hall know my dealings at &s;ome future hour,' &s;aid Ellen; and giving him a paper, added, 'this is my direction: now give me yours.' 'And mu&s;t I wait till a future hour for the explanation of &s;o much my&s;tery?' &s;aid Mr. Raymond. 'You mu&s;t.' 'Well then, let it not be very di&s;tant.' He then gave her a di|rection to him&s;elf, under the name of Ma&s;on, at a particular hotel in Stra&s;burg: and with reiterated wi&s;hes that her journey might prove more pro&s;|perous than it promi&s;ed to do, he at length &s;uf|fered her to depart.</P>
<P>This adventure did not appear half &s;o &s;ingular in the eyes of Mr. Raymond, as it did in tho&s;e of Ellen. The circum&s;tance of finding him&s;elf known to her, confirmed his former &s;u&s;picions: and he had no doubt but that the &s;tory which &s;he pro|mi&s;ed him, would only be a detail of the ingrati|tude and cruelty of &s;ome man of his own &s;et, with whom he had a&s;&s;ociated before he left London. But Ellen was &s;truck in no common degree with the &s;ingularity of meeting in the woods of Bohe|mia a man &s;o nearly allied to her, in circum&s;tan|ces &s;o di&s;graceful, that &s;he could not avail her&s;elf of their connexion to the alleviation of her own di&s;tre&s;&s;es: nor could &s;he forbear adverting to the power &s;he had had, of admini&s;tering, from her &s;canty pittance, to the wants of two people, who, had it not been for their vices, might have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every comfort and every accommoda|tion this world can afford.</P>

<P>THIS adventure furni&s;hed Ellen with &s;ufficient food for thought, as &s;he walked on: and as the day was much cooler than any &s;he had yet expe|rienced, &s;he continued her journey, without tak|ing her u&s;ual re&s;t at noon. Fortunately &s;he ar|rived at a decent village early in the evening: and here &s;he re&s;olved to take up her repo&s;e for the night; the fatigues of the preceding day and night having made re&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her. In an&s;wer to the inquiries &s;he made here, &s;he had the &s;atisfaction to find, that &s;he had not deviated very widely from the direct road to Egra. She had fixed upon this place, merely as a point, by which to direct her enquiries: but there was nothing &s;he wi&s;hed &s;o much to avoid, as large towns and cities; and being now pretty well &s;killed in the be&s;t man|ner of going from one village to another, without &s;traying too far di&s;tant from the public road, &s;he contrived, in about fourteen days from the time of her e&s;cape from captivity, to enter Franconia, without having pa&s;&s;ed through Egra, or &s;uffered much either from fatigue, hunger, or alarm. Having thus happily accompli&s;hed what &s;he com|puted to be &s;omewhat above the fir&s;t hundred miles of her journey, &s;he drew a lucky pre&s;age

for the remaining eight. But accu&s;tomed as &s;he now was to being alone, &s;he felt a dread of that part of her travels, which was to lead her among the more thickly inhabited parts of the road, more than any one of the dangers which awaited her in the ob&s;cure fore&s;ts and &s;olitary paths. The ob&s;ervation of Mr. Raymond often returned to her mind: and when &s;he reflected on the different treatment which the beggars wandering through the populous &s;treets of a great city u&s;ually meet with, from that &s;he had experienced in the Bohe|mian wilds, &s;he could not help drawing a conclu|&s;ion, that a clo&s;e neighbourhood was not favour|able to the virtue of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections made her view her &s;ingle du|cat with a &s;igh. But &s;he re&s;olved, as long as the &s;ale of her linen, her mandoline, or the poor du|cat in que&s;tion, could pre&s;erve her from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of it, not to a&s;k charity in any town. Ellen continued her method of travelling with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s; though &s;he found a very &s;en&s;ible differ|ence in the appearance and manners of the coun|try. The latter was more populous, it was bet|ter cultivated, but beggars were more numerous, and &s;imple ho&s;pitality le&s;s. Although &s;he was readily relieved at a door, &s;he no longer found it &s;o ea&s;y to be admitted under the &s;helter of a friendly roof: her mu&s;ic was le&s;s an equivalent for all the kindne&s;s which was &s;hewn her. Ellen, who could not pay for a lodging, and who&s;e &s;oul recoiled from a&s;&s;ociating with the herds of com|mon beggars who &s;o frequently cro&s;&s;ed her way, was therefore nece&s;&s;itated often to content her&s;elf with what accidental cover &s;he could find, and which frequently amounted to nothing better than what a wall afforded, where, with her head upon
<PB N="201" REF="036127_0413_1008530464A04FF0">
her bundle, &s;he often &s;ought for that &s;leep which &s;he could not find; and, &s;ometimes, overcome with fatigue, even in this expo&s;ed and comfortle&s;s &s;ituation, &s;lept &s;oundly.</P>
<P>The&s;e frequent &s;leepings, expo&s;ed to the open air, or in &s;ituations little &s;heltered from the weather, made more &s;ub&s;tantial clothing nece&s;&s;ary. She dur&s;t not part with the only piece of money which &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; for however &s;he might hope &s;he &s;hould receive the &s;upply promi&s;ed her by Mr. Raymond at Cologne, &s;he was too prudent to act as if &s;he were certain of it. Her mandoline &s;he now found of little u&s;e to her: and &s;he was therefore re&s;olved to make that the fir&s;t &s;acrifice. Its real value was &s;mall: and, in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, &s;he was not likely to get even that value for it. But &s;he thought her&s;elf happy in exchanging it for a rug cloak, which made a part of her bundle in the day, and covered her warmly over at night.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through the heart of Germany, keeping on the north of the Mayne, and directing her cour&s;e towards Frankfort. She found the little German which &s;he at fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, very &s;erviceable to her: and &s;he daily increa&s;ed her &s;tock; &s;o that &s;he now found no difficulty in ex|plaining her wants. Indeed her difficulties did not lie in explaining, but in relieving them: and they every day became more numerous and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing. Her fir&s;t pair of &s;hoes were almo&s;t worn out. Her clothes grew thin: and though, from habit, &s;he could now walk more miles in the cour&s;e of a day, than &s;he could, when fir&s;t &s;he &s;et out, &s;o long a continuance of hard&s;hips and fatigue began to have an effect upon her &s;trength, and &s;till more upon her &s;pirits. The hope which had
<PB N="202" REF="036127_0414_10085305EB34F960" MS="y">
at fir&s;t buoyed her up, began to &s;ub&s;ide: for as &s;he reflected upon the di&s;tance there was &s;till between her and England, &s;he began to think it impo&s;&s;ible, that her powers of &s;truggling with the difficulties which &s;urrounded her, would continue to her journey's end. A degree of de&s;pondency fol|lowed &s;uch thoughts: and this increa&s;ed the very evils &s;he feared. She endeavoured, however, to rou&s;e her&s;elf; to awaken hope once more in her heart; and to derive all the comfort from her undimini&s;hed reliance on the goodne&s;s and wi&s;|dom of Providence, which &s;uch reliance was cal|culated to afford. She adverted to the extraor|dinary circum&s;tance of her having met with Mr. Raymond, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance it was probable &s;he &s;hould receive from him: and &s;he was not un|willing to yield to the degree of &s;uper&s;tition which induced her to believe this might be one mark of the &s;uperintendance of Providence, which, whe|ther evident or not, &s;he never for a moment doubted.</P>
<P>Having revived her hopes, and &s;trengthened her courage by &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e, &s;he pur&s;ued her way towards Frankfort, but following her original plan, &s;he entered not that place, but turned a&s;ide to a village not far di&s;tant, where &s;he arrived in &s;omewhat le&s;s than a month from the time when &s;he had entered Germany. Here &s;he he&s;itated whether &s;he &s;hould proceed to Mentz, and from thence attempt taking a pa&s;&s;age on the Rhine. The ea&s;e this would be to her, was her &s;tronge&s;t inducement: but &s;he doubted whether the &s;ale of all &s;he was worth, would enable her to defray the expen&s;es of her voyage: and the que&s;|tion recurring, what &s;he &s;hould do, when thus without any re&s;ource, but the precarious one of

charity during the re&s;t of her journey, &s;hould &s;he find her&s;elf di&s;appointed of the promi&s;ed &s;upply at Cologne, determined her to tru&s;t to her feet &s;ome time longer. She directed her cour&s;e, how|ever, as nearly as &s;he could, towards the Rhine, thinking it prudent to be within reach of the only mode of conveyance, which her circum&s;tances would allow her to avail her&s;elf of, however her &s;trength might fail, or her health &s;ink under her fatigue.</P>
<P>The romantic and highly cultivated country which this determination led her through, could not be viewed by Ellen, even in her pre&s;ent &s;tate of depre&s;&s;ion, without the liveli&s;t emotions of de|light. The picture&s;que &s;ituation of the villages, the &s;triking forms of the hills, each crowned with a ca&s;tle, the vineyards, the che&s;nut groves, all formed a &s;cene &s;uch as &s;he had never before wit|ne&s;&s;ed, and which filled her mind with images of beauty perfectly new. She ob&s;erved, however, the extreme inequality which a wine country pro|duces in its inhabitants, even of the &s;ame rank. And the &s;plendid &s;ituation in which &s;he &s;aw &s;ome of the pea&s;ants, did not in her eyes compen&s;ate for the &s;ight of the many poor people with which &s;ome of the villages &s;warmed. This was a coun|try, however, in which Ellen her&s;elf fared very well. She often gathered che&s;nuts enough to &s;erve her for a meal, when no other was to be had: and wine &s;he &s;ometimes received gratis, and at others could purcha&s;e for a trifle. She found no difficulty in exchanging &s;ome of her linen, either for a little money, or for &s;uch food as was nece&s;|&s;ary for her. It was, however, with the greate&s;t economy that &s;he made u&s;e of this re&s;ource. But by the prudent management of that, never forget|ting
<PB N="204" REF="036127_0416_1008530A2702CD18">
the con&s;ideration of the future hour in the wants of the pre&s;ent, and of the other means which were in her power, &s;he was enabled to move on pro&s;perou&s;ly, though &s;lowly, towards her point. The beauties of the country le&s;&s;ened as &s;he approached Cologne: and when &s;he &s;et her foot within that dark and ugly city, her heart &s;unk, from a mingled &s;en&s;ation of di&s;gu&s;t and fear. To wander, unknown and unprotected, through the di&s;mal and half de&s;erted &s;treets of this decay|ing place, where &s;he was &s;urrounded by falling and empty hou&s;es, appeared to her infinitely more dreary and depre&s;&s;ing than all the thick fore&s;ts and extended wilds which &s;he had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed. She would have in&s;tantly quitted a place &s;o unconge|nial with her feelings, and &s;ought &s;helter in &s;ome of the numerous farm hou&s;es which &s;urround its walls, and where &s;he might have refre&s;hed her&s;elf with milk and vegetables, had &s;he not been eager to a&s;certain what &s;he had to hope from the pro|mi&s;es of Mr. Raymond.</P>
<P>With &s;ome difficulty &s;he inquired her way to the hotel, to which he had given her a direction; and &s;oon found, with more grief than &s;urpri&s;e, that there was no letter for her. The very pre|carious circum&s;tances in which &s;he had left Mr. Raymond &s;ufficiently accounted for the breach of his promi&s;e to her: and without accu&s;ing him of any intentional deceit, or criminal neglect, &s;he withdrew, congratulating her&s;elf upon the pru|dence with which &s;he had hu&s;banded her little &s;tore, and which &s;he now found was to be her only dependance.</P>

<P>AS &s;he had en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red the hotel, &s;he had ob&s;erved two carriages, which &s;eemed by their appearance, and the people who were employed about them, to belong to &s;ome traveller of di&s;tinction: but &s;he had paid little attention to them. On her return, however, one of the &s;ervants &s;tood &s;o directly in her way, that &s;he was obliged to &s;top till he removed. The moment he &s;aw he was a hin|drance to any one, he made way with a civility which Ellen was con&s;cious was not paid to her appearance. On her thanking him, he turned &s;uddenly round, as if &s;truck by the tone of her voice; when, what were her emotions when &s;he knew him for the per&s;onal &s;ervant of Mr. Villars! The man marked not the confu&s;ion into which he had thrown her; for no &s;ooner did his eyes &s;weep ha&s;tily over her dre&s;s, than he &s;eemed to have abandoned the thought which had before &s;uddenly occurred: and he returned to his bu&s;ine&s;s, which was di&s;po&s;ing &s;ome parcels within the carriage, with undivided attention.</P>
<P>The effect that &s;uch an unexpected rencontre had upon Ellen, was &s;o great, that for a moment &s;he was unable to &s;tir: but recollecting her&s;elf, &s;he con&s;idered that &s;he had no proof that this

per&s;on was &s;till in the &s;ervice of Mr. Villars, and that if he were, there was nothing &s;he ought more to avoid, than the di&s;co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring her&s;elf to him.&mdash; The&s;e thoughts made her remove from the place which &s;he was in, as &s;peedily as her trembling limbs would allow. But &s;he felt it impo&s;&s;ible to quit Cologne, without being a&s;&s;ured whether or no Mr. Villars was there. She therefore took &s;helter in a baker's &s;hop, which was immediately oppo&s;ite the hotel, and where &s;he hoped &s;he might be allowed to remain, until the carriages moved off, e&s;pecially as it was plain, from the bu&s;tle among the &s;ervants, that this would &s;oon take place.</P>
<P>Many and divers were the thoughts which oc|cupied Ellen, as &s;he watched from her retreat the motions of the people employed in making the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for their departure. If the ma&s;ter of tho&s;e &s;ervants &s;hould prove Mr. Villars, the de&s;ire of di&s;covering her&s;elf to him, &s;eemed almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible. Her nece&s;&s;itous &s;ituation, the nearne&s;s of his relation to her, the perfect inno|cence which had always accompanied the whole of their intercour&s;e, made her in one moment de|cide, that &s;uch &s;ub&s;tantial advantages as would ac|crue from her making her&s;elf known to him, were not to be &s;acrificed to punctilios and the fear of mi&s;con&s;truction. But the reflections of the next in&s;tant corrected this too flattering, but unju&s;t conclu&s;ion. Whether &s;he were ever again to live with Sir William, or whether &s;he were to be re|gularly &s;eparated from him, her ju&s;tification and her all of happine&s;s in this life, would depend upon being able to clear every hour of her life from &s;u&s;picion. Her return to England with Mr. Villars would make this impo&s;&s;ible. Her &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="207" REF="036127_0419_100853138633B138">
propriety al&s;o revolted from the idea of making the man, who had never cea&s;ed to be her lover, the fir&s;t confidant of Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> William's jealou&s;y and ill u&s;age. A conver&s;ation between them on &s;uch a &s;ubject mu&s;t place them equally in the mo&s;t critical and embarra&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances. It mu&s;t unavoidably recal ideas and &s;entiments which nei|ther ought to feel and &s;till le&s;s to avow. Regret and re&s;entment mu&s;t ari&s;e in the brea&s;ts of both, when canva&s;&s;ing the con&s;equences of a marriage, which had broken a&s;under all the ties that love had formed between them: and it could hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the lover would not be tempted to &s;eek revenge for the injuries done to the ob|ject of his affections, where the natural relation which he held to her, would &s;eem to give him a right to be the puni&s;her of her oppre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;aw &s;he had but one re&s;olution to take: but &s;carcely ever before had &s;he found her will &s;uch a rebel to her rea&s;on. While &s;he was en|gaged in the&s;e reflections, &s;he ob&s;erved, that a lady's maid was al&s;o bu&s;ied about the carriages. Ellen's fir&s;t thought, on &s;eeing her, was, that &s;he might have &s;pared all her debatings. Henry was not near her; for Henry was not married. The next reminded her of the length of her ab&s;ence from England, and of her ignorance of all that had taken place there during that period. This thought was followed by another. If he was mar|ried, all objection to making her&s;elf known to him would vani&s;h. She &s;tepped out of the &s;hop with a de&s;ign to make an enquiry of one of the &s;ervants, when her better rea&s;on cau&s;ed her as ha&s;tily again to enter it. There was no doubt but that Mr. Villars believed her dead. It was un|certain what would be the effect upon him of her
<PB N="208" REF="036127_0420_100853156A4E3EF8">
&s;udden appearance in &s;uch peculiar and afflicting circum&s;tances. His emotions might be mi&s;taken: and &s;he might, by this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lfi&s;h act of gratification, introduce the fiend jealou&s;y into the brea&s;t of a woman, who now believed her&s;elf happy in his undivided love. If the fir&s;t wi&s;h of Ellen's heart had been, to make the happine&s;s of Henry her|&s;elf; it had long given place to a &s;econd, little le&s;s fervent, that of &s;eeing him happy with &s;ome worthy object, who, in de&s;erving all his love, might po&s;&s;e&s;s, and return it. Probably he had now found &s;uch a one: and no per&s;onal inconvenience could weigh with Ellen again&s;t the &s;lighte&s;t ha|zard of an interruption of their mutual happine&s;s. She re&s;olved, therefore, to give up every thought of di&s;covering her&s;elf to him: but &s;he waited in breathle&s;s impatience, and with an agitation not to be de&s;cribed, the moment which would clear up all her doubts. She waited not long. Scarcely had &s;he decided to remain concealed, when the ma&s;ter of the carriage appeared. It was Henry him&s;elf! He was in deep mourning, and, lean|ing familiarly upon his arm, was a young genteel looking woman, in deep mourning al&s;o. Ellen's heart beat: &s;he ga&s;ped for breath. Henry a&s;&s;i&s;ted his companion to get into the carriage: and im|mediately jumping after her, the door was &s;hut, and they were driven away full &s;peed. The other carriage drove up; two &s;ervants entered it; and with two others on hor&s;eback, followed the fir&s;t carriage.</P>
<P>Ellen &s;tood immoveably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, with her eyes eagerly following the whole train, until not a glimp&s;e of them remained to be &s;een. Then bur&s;t|ing into tears, &s;he ha&s;tily left the &s;hop, almo&s;t uncon&s;cious that &s;he had ever entered it, and
<PB N="209" REF="036127_0421_1008531ADA4BA0E0">
wholly unknowing where &s;he meant to go. A few moments brought her to her recollection. But &s;uch was the inde&s;cribable angui&s;h which had &s;eized her, that for &s;ome time &s;he thought, in the varied vexations of her di&s;tre&s;sful life, &s;he had never known &s;o bitter a moment as the pre|&s;ent. To have been obliged, in the helple&s;s and wretched &s;tate &s;he was in, to &s;uffer him who would have been the &s;ofte&s;t &s;oother of her &s;orrow, her warme&s;t friend, her mo&s;t &s;trenuous protector, thus to depart una&s;&s;i&s;tant to her wants, and un|con&s;cious of her di&s;tre&s;s, pre&s;&s;ed &s;o heavily on her mind the &s;everity of her fate, and &s;hewed her to her&s;elf &s;o far removed from all human aid, that, for a time, even her &s;trong and well-di&s;ciplined mind was not able to bear up again&s;t &s;uch a weight of wretchedne&s;s. If Cologne had before ap|peared di&s;gu&s;ting, it was now become in&s;upportable. She hurried to get beyond its hated walls. The three cla&s;&s;es of people, beggars, eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and nobles, into which its inhabitants are divided, were all alike indifferent to her: nor was the ug|line&s;s or de&s;olation of the city it&s;elf any longer objects of attention or &s;oliloquy. Her mind con|tained but one idea: Henry carried rapidly from her when &s;he mo&s;t &s;tood in need of his friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. No other thought found admi&s;&s;ion into her mind. She felt, &s;he &s;aw, &s;he thought of nothing el&s;e.</P>

<P>WHEN Ellen got again beyond the city walls, &s;he &s;eemed to breathe more freely: the tumult of her mind began to &s;ub&s;ide: &s;he began to acknow|ledge, that no new misfortune had befallen her; that &s;he was in no re&s;pect wor&s;e in con&s;equence of what had happened; that Henry, placed be|yond the power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting by di&s;tance, or by &s;i|tuation, was the &s;ame thing in effect; and that if &s;he had been able to bear the one with patience, there was no rea&s;on why &s;he &s;hould find the other intolerable.</P>
<P>Having thus re&s;trained that power of imagi|nation, which is never indulged but to our hurt, with a recompo&s;ed mind &s;he began once more to call a council of her own thoughts, as to what was the be&s;t method in which to proceed. Her fi|nances &s;eemed to allow her little choice: and &s;he re&s;olved, keeping as near to the Rhine as po&s;&s;ible, to make the be&s;t of her way to Nimeguen, and from thence to Helvoet&s;luys. But the days were now con&s;iderably &s;hortened: a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the proportional length of the nights made the tru&s;ting to any or no &s;helter, that might or might not be near when darkne&s;s came on, more formidable and grievous than ever. Ellen, therefore, often &s;ound her&s;elf

obliged to &s;acrifice what would have procured her a meal, to the now almo&s;t equally nece&s;&s;ary com|fort of a lodging &s;ecured from the weather. She &s;till avoided re&s;ting in any towns; and made her way from village to village, which, in the popu|lous and cultivated country which lies n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Rhine, between Cologne and Nimeguen, &s;he found it not difficult to do: nor had &s;he rea&s;on to complain of want of humanity or charity in the people. Her gentle manners, her being a fo|reigner, and above all, the languor and melan|choly which had now too &s;trongly taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of every feature, &s;eemed to plead irre&s;i&s;tibly in her favour. To a night's lodging, and a bowl of milk in the morning, were often added, on di&s;|mi&s;&s;ing her, a few &s;tivers, or a &s;lice of bread which &s;erved for her dinner. The money &s;he carefully hoarded; for her pa&s;&s;age to England was perpe|tually in her mind, and the means when there, which &s;he &s;hould take to arrive in Northum|berland.</P>
<P>In this manner and by &s;low degrees, &s;he reached Nimeguen, without any material evil, or extraor|dinary adventure. It was at Nimeguen that &s;he had cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine, when &s;he travelled with Sir William: and &s;he was well acquainted with the different routes to be pur&s;ued, and the manners of the people in Holland. But &s;he well knew the difference of &s;ituation in a country where nothing is to he had without money, between the wife of a rich Engli&s;hman of fa&s;hion, and a poor mendicant, who&s;e very exi&s;tence depended upon the charity of others. That country where a man pays for the few moments that his great coat lies upon a bench, cannot be very favourable to the wants of any individual, who does not contribute &s;ome|thing
<PB N="212" REF="036127_0424_10085322E560FC28">
to the great &s;tock of national wealth: and Ellen could not condemn the principle, which made a nation hard-hearted to beggars, who&s;e very exi&s;tence depended upon the indu&s;try of all. The little &s;u&s;tenance &s;he took, &s;he therefore con|trived to pay for: and as the cheapne&s;s of a convey|ance by the trech&s;cuits enabled her to avail her|&s;elf of them, as a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of her hitherto never-cea&s;ing fatigue, &s;he reached Helvoet&s;luys ea&s;ily and &s;omewhat recruited in &s;trength. Fortunately &s;he arrived only a few hours before the &s;ailing of a packet, in which &s;he ea&s;ily procured a pa&s;&s;age, and at an expence proportionate the meanne&s;s of her appearance. The only pa&s;&s;engers of any fa&s;hion were a gentleman and lady, who had few attendants, and appeared not to be rich. Both the lady and her only female &s;ervant were &s;uf|ferers in the greate&s;t degree from &s;ea &s;ickne&s;s: and as Ellen was happily free from all indi&s;po&s;i|tion, and the only woman be&s;ides them&s;elves in the packet, &s;he attended them, at the reque&s;t of the lady's hu&s;band, in the cabin; and afforded them all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and comfort in her power. The pa&s;&s;age was pro&s;perous, and not of the longe&s;t kind: and when they landed, the gentle|man, in con&s;ideration of Ellen's cheerful attend|ance upon his wife, and judging by her clothes, that &s;he was by no means above receiving a &s;mall gratuity, gave her, before they parted, five &s;hil|lings.</P>
<P>Ellen was now in England. But the emotion with which &s;he once again put her foot upon her native land, after &s;o long and &s;o di&s;a&s;trous an ab|&s;ence, were not tho&s;e of unmixed joy, or even of very cheerful hopes. During her tedious and difficult journey, &s;he had &s;eldom had lei&s;ure, from

the pre&s;&s;ing wants of the pa&s;&s;ing hour, to turn her thoughts upon the fate which might await her, if ever &s;he &s;hould &s;o far &s;urmount tho&s;e wants as to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;e &s;he had in hand. But now, when nearly all her difficulties were over, and her nece&s;&s;ities drawing to a conclu&s;ion, the &s;ituation which &s;he &s;hould find her friends and family in, with what might be the re&s;olutions that circum&s;tances, or the requi&s;itions of Sir William might call for on her part, filled her mind with anxiety and dread. So far from knowing what to hope, &s;he knew not what to wi&s;h: and if the idea of being regularly &s;eparated from Sir William, and being allowed to live unmole&s;ted with her father, by occurring the mo&s;t frequently to her imagination, &s;eemed to &s;ay that this was really what would be mo&s;t acceptable to her; there were &s;o many con&s;iderations which checked the ri&s;ing de&s;ire, that it amounted not to a wi&s;h.</P>
<P>She had a child! (at lea&s;t &s;he hoped &s;he had) and for the &s;ake of this child &s;he would have con|&s;ented to have been placed in a &s;ituation much more repugnant to her feelings than a re-union with Sir William would place her in. Even of Sir William's conduct towards her, &s;he was cau|tious of forming a too decided opinion: and if it could be proved, that he had been mi&s;taken, and not malicious, &s;he felt nothing within her unre|&s;entful heart, which &s;hould prevent her endea|vouring, by a life of duty and affection, to obli|terate from the minds of both all the mi&s;ery which they had mutually cau&s;ed each other.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible not to think of the&s;e things. It was impo&s;&s;ible that thinking of them &s;hould not &s;ink her to the lowe&s;t degree of &s;adne&s;s: but
<PB N="214" REF="036127_0426_1008532890053240">
it was equally impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;he &s;hould form one probable conjecture, how &s;he &s;hould in future be induced to act. Her impatience, however, to bring her fate to an i&s;&s;ue, increa&s;ed to a feeling of the mo&s;t painful kind. But, although in Eng|land, &s;he was &s;till more than two hundred miles from that home where &s;he could alone be &s;ure of a kind reception, or where &s;he could inform her|&s;elf of tho&s;e circum&s;tances upon which the con|duct of her future life mu&s;t depend. To appear as a beggar in a country, the laws of which pro|vide &s;o amply for the wants of the indigent, as at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eemed to render it impo&s;&s;ible that vice and beggary &s;hould be disjoined, and where tho&s;e very laws, acting as it were upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, make the very act of a&s;king charity criminal, and a&s;&s;ign a puni&s;hment for it, was a &s;ituation which to Ellen appeared intolerable. The &s;ea&s;onable &s;up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly of the five &s;hillings given her by the gen|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">man, re&s;cued her from a nece&s;&s;ity, to which, however, &s;he mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>She had, indeed, during the &s;ad reflections which occupied her mind on this &s;ubject, during her pa&s;&s;age from Holland, debated whether &s;he &s;hould not, on her arrival in England, make her ca&s;e known to &s;ome magi&s;trate: and it is probable &s;he would have had recour&s;e to this method, ra|ther than have appeared in the character of a va|gabond, had &s;he continued as entirely de&s;titute as &s;he was previous to the gift of the five &s;hillings. But &s;he was very thankful to be &s;aved from this extremity: &s;ince, re&s;olute not to have told a fal&s;e tale, &s;he mu&s;t have been obliged, both again&s;t her inclination and judgment, to have told at lea&s;t &s;o much of the truth, as might have led to di&s;co|veries, which, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, ought to be made

only to her neare&s;t relations, and mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured friends; &s;o &s;ea&s;onable and &s;o important was a gift, in it&s;elf &s;o &s;mall, that probably the giver would &s;carcely place it, in balancing his account, on the &s;ide of charity. With the&s;e five &s;hillings, which had proved a mine of wealth to Ellen, and by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ale of almo&s;t every thing &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, except the mi&s;erable clothes &s;he wore, Ellen was ena|bled to procure a pa&s;&s;age in a coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;el, which was to &s;ail the next day for Newca&s;tle, and al&s;o to provide for her &s;u&s;tenance on the voyage.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the latene&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, the pa&s;&s;age proved a happy and tolerably &s;hort one: and Ellen at length beheld her&s;elf landed within thirty miles of Groby Manor. But &s;he was now ab&s;olutely pennyle&s;s, nor did &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ingle article of clothes, for which, in the opulent and money-getting town of Newca&s;tle, &s;he would have been able to have found a purcha&s;er. Her ob|jections to appearing as a common beggar, &s;eek|ing her bread from door to door, were as &s;trong in Northumberland as in E&s;&s;ex, and the fear of applying to any per&s;on in any of the higher ranks of life &s;till &s;tronger. It appeared impo&s;&s;ible to her, that &s;he &s;hould be able to tell &s;uch a &s;tory as would entitle her to any thing beyond the mo&s;t common relief, to any per&s;on in her own coun|try, without leading to que&s;tions, which would either involve her in fal&s;ehood, or lead to the di&s;covery of too much truth. One valuable &s;he was &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of: this was her wedding-ring: and though it had only been the &s;eal of mi&s;ery to her, &s;he felt an extreme reluctance to parting with it. But &s;cruples and &s;orrows founded only in imagination, &s;he was in the habit of &s;ubduing. Her rea&s;on acknowledged that the giving up her
<PB N="217" REF="036127_0429_100853306699F158">
wedding-ring was the mo&s;t eligible method of &s;up|plying her pre&s;ent wants of any in her power. She was within a few yards of a &s;ilver&s;mith's &s;hop. She turned towards it. She &s;topt for a moment at the door. She dreaded to encounter the curio&s;ity &s;he was aware the application &s;he was about to make would excite. She he&s;itated. The &s;ame thoughts pa&s;&s;ed through her mind. But now compelled by the conviction, that every other way to relieve her di&s;tre&s;s, was &s;till more objectionable, than this, &s;he entered the &s;hop. She entered it however with a look of &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ment and irre&s;olution, as drew on her the notice of the man who kept it. It was not until he had enquired twice in words, and with a manner perfectly civil, what &s;he wanted, that &s;he had courage enough to advance towards him. Then taking off her worn-out glove, and drawing her ring from her finger, &s;he &s;aid, with he&s;itation, 'If, Sir, you will let me have three &s;hillings, or half a crown, upon this ring, I &s;hould think my|&s;elf much obliged to you.' She &s;aw the man's eyes fixed in&s;tantly upon her hand, the whitene&s;s of which, with the delicacy of its form, ill ac|corded with the &s;habbine&s;s of her garments, and the di&s;tre&s;s her pre&s;ent application indicated. 'I am not accu&s;tomed to take pawns, Madam,' &s;aid the man. 'Perhaps then,' replied Ellen, 'you would give me the value of its weight, Sir?' 'It mu&s;t di&s;tre&s;s you, Madam, to part with your wed|ding-ring,' returned he, looking earne&s;tly in her face. 'I would not willingly part with it en|tirely,' &s;aid Ellen: 'If therefore you would be kind enough not to di&s;po&s;e of it for a few days, I &s;hould take it as a favour. In le&s;s than a week I
<PB N="218" REF="036127_0430_10085334DEC68A40">
hope to be able to repurcha&s;e it.' 'No, Madam, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid the man, 'I will not take your ring. You are &s;o like a lady who is dead, and who was al|ways better than her word, that I will take yours for &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as this,' laying down five &s;hil|lings, 'and if I &s;hould lo&s;e it, I will think it is given to that lady, and I &s;hall be very well &s;atis|fied.' Ellen, a&s;toni&s;hed and embarra&s;&s;ed, thought her&s;elf di&s;covered; and, eager to remove from the earne&s;t &s;crutiny of her new friend, ha&s;tily took up the money; and &s;aying, 'I am indeed extremely obliged to you, Sir, I will take care not to di&s;|credit your friend,' &s;he ha&s;tened out of the &s;hop: &s;he &s;aw that the man followed her to the door of it, and attentively watched her. She therefore turned, as &s;oon as &s;he could, into another &s;treet, and with a beating heart and trembling limbs, took &s;helter in the fir&s;t &s;hop that pre&s;ented it&s;elf, which could afford her any refre&s;hment. Here, as &s;he purcha&s;ed &s;ome rolls, her thoughts were bu&s;ily employed in endeavouring to recollect the features of the &s;ilver&s;mith, who, &s;he was per|&s;uaded, mu&s;t have &s;een her before, and whom, it was probable that in her happier days &s;he had befriended. Suddenly the remembrance of the grand&s;on of old Deborah cro&s;&s;ed her mind: and in the kind relief ju&s;t now granted her, &s;he re|cogni&s;ed the gratitude and worth of that hone&s;t young man. Cheered by the recollection of an act of benevolence, which, from the &s;ea&s;onable return it had produced, &s;eemed to have placed her in a particular manner under the protection of Providence, Ellen pur&s;ued her way with a mingled &s;en&s;ation of delight and hope, which had long been a &s;tranger to her bo&s;om. The five or
<PB N="219" REF="036127_0431_10085336655BA8E0">
&s;ix and twenty miles which now lay between her and the haven where &s;he hoped to repo&s;e, after all her &s;ufferings, however it might have appeared &s;ix years ago as a gulph not to be pa&s;&s;ed by her, in circum&s;tances like the pre&s;ent, now &s;eemed little more than a needle's point. She felt no difficulty. She apprehended no danger. She thought every object familiar to her. She imagined that &s;he mu&s;t know every face that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed; and almo&s;t expected to be called by her name by every per|&s;on &s;he met. The day, however, was &s;omewhat advanced, and night came on, when &s;he was &s;till &s;ixteen miles from Groby Manor: &s;he ea&s;ily pro|cured her&s;elf a decent and comfortable accommo|nation for the night (for &s;he was now rich, and could pay &s;umptuou&s;ly for what &s;he wanted): but &s;leep, which had often vi&s;ited her under the im|perfect &s;helter of a wall, or when expo&s;ed to the droppings of a tree, now fled the warm comforts of her pre&s;ent chamber. The thoughts of the next day filled her mind, and held her eyes waking. She aro&s;e with the fir&s;t rays of light, and re&s;umed her journey.</P>
<P>It was a bright fro&s;ty morning, in the begin|ning of October; all nature looked chearful, and Ellen's heart, which &s;till retained the impre&s;&s;ions &s;he had received in the &s;ilver&s;mith's &s;hop the day before, partook of the cheerfulne&s;s around her. As &s;he walked forward, the&s;e &s;en&s;ations &s;ub&s;ided; and gave place to the fears which the probable changes that had taken place during the la&s;t four years in the home to which &s;he was returning, naturally gave ri&s;e to. The day pa&s;&s;ed on. Ellen drew every hour nearer to that &s;pot, where alone, in the whole cour&s;e of her life, &s;he had known
<PB N="220" REF="036127_0432_1008533957033470">
happine&s;s, and where only &s;he could hope, if ever happine&s;s were to be hers again, to find it. Her emotions increa&s;ed every &s;tep &s;he advanced. Sometimes &s;he was obliged to &s;top for the re|fre&s;hment which the failing powers made nece&s;|&s;ary; at others to remain a few moments mo|tionle&s;s where &s;he was, without the power of &s;eeking any.</P>

<P>THE evening approached; and the di&s;tant chimnies of Groby Manor appeared. 'If time,' &s;aid Ellen, 'has not changed the habits of the dear inhabitants of that beloved man&s;ion, this is the hour when they are about to a&s;&s;emble round the &s;ocial tea board. Now the evening mu&s;ic, or the evening lecture begins. Oh! beloved friends! there awaits you an interruption to your plea&s;ures, which will be infinitely dearer to you than them all.' Ellen &s;aid this, as &s;he began to a&s;cend the hill which led by gentle windings to the hou&s;e. She had determined to approach it on that &s;ide which looked upon the valley leading to the par&s;onage, and to make her entrance, if &s;he could, through the windows of the common &s;itting-room which opened from the ground: there it was likely that &s;ome, if not all the family would be a&s;&s;embled: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;un was not yet &s;et, &s;he
<PB N="222" REF="036127_0434_1008533FF704D6C0">
did not fear finding her entrance barred. The tumult of her mind was &s;uch, that her de&s;igns might rather be called impul&s;e than rea&s;oning: and as &s;he a&s;cended the hill, her limbs could hardly &s;upport her trembling frame. She reached the top. She drew near the hou&s;e. A plane tree was placed &s;o near one of the windows, as to prevent all objects beyond it from being &s;een from thence. It was on this &s;ide that Ellen ap|proached. The window immediately behind the plane tree was open: Ellen intended, or thought &s;he intended, entering through it. She advanced. Her tremblings increa&s;ed. She was obliged to &s;upport her&s;elf again&s;t the trunk of the plane tree. She heard the &s;ound of an in&s;trument. She could &s;ee within the room; &s;he looked; at the harp&s;ichord &s;at the very lady whom &s;he had &s;een accompanying Mr. Villars &s;ix weeks before into his chai&s;e at Cologne. Mr. Villars him&s;elf was at that moment behind her chair: and hanging upon her gown was a playful little girl. In ano|ther part of the room, &s;at Mrs. Raymond at work, and near her Mr. Mordaunt, and two young girls, who were al&s;o at work. Ellen remained &s;peechle&s;s, motionle&s;s, and gazing intently upon what &s;he &s;aw, and yet uncon&s;cious that &s;he &s;aw any thing. Every faculty was &s;u&s;pended. A temporary &s;tupor had &s;eized her.</P>
<P>At this moment, one of the girls rai&s;ing her head from her work, &s;aw a figure under the plane tree. 'Who's there?' &s;aid &s;he, in a voice of affright. 'It is I,' &s;aid Ellen; and &s;prang for|ward: but could do no more: &s;he &s;unk lifele&s;s on the window frame&mdash;'What &s;ounds are tho&s;e?' cried Henry. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hed toward her. He rai&s;ed her in his arms. 'It is&mdash;Oh heavens!
<PB N="223" REF="036127_0435_10085341DAB56ED0">
is <HI>this</HI> my Ellen?' 'Ellen,' &s;aid the a&s;toni&s;hed and bewildered father, 'Gracious God! ha&s;t thou &s;uffered her to leave thy man&s;ions of bli&s;s, to comfort her afflicted parent?'</P>
<P>Ellen was laid upon a &s;ofa; but &s;he continued &s;en&s;ele&s;s; nor were tho&s;e who continued gazing round her more con&s;cious of exi&s;tence than her|&s;elf. One of the young people, le&s;s intere&s;ted than the re&s;t in the &s;cene before her, ran for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. The room was pre&s;ently filled with &s;ervants. Ellen began to revive. Henry kneel|ing before her, had &s;eized both her hands. 'I have found her; I have again found her,' repeated he; 'and no power on earth &s;hall part us more.' Ellen heard him not; &s;he &s;aw him not: &s;he &s;aw only her father; and with a &s;udden motion threw her&s;elf at his feet. He cla&s;ped her in his arms. 'It is her&s;elf! &s;he is alive! Oh! ble&s;&s;ed God! what wonders are the&s;e!' Although Ellen's worn-down frame was little able to &s;upport &s;uch violent and affecting emotions, yet, being prepared for the &s;cene, &s;he was the fir&s;t to recover &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure. 'I am indeed re&s;tored to you,' &s;aid &s;he, 'by little le&s;s than a miracle. Let us not, by our own vehemence, make vain all that God has done for us;' and looking around her, &s;he &s;eemed to de|mand whether &s;he &s;aw all the family that time and ab&s;ence had &s;pared. Her father pre&s;&s;ed her to his heart. 'You will &s;ee your &s;i&s;ters. They are married; they are happy. But your mother &mdash;(let us not repine)&mdash;in&s;tead of a mother's em|braces, receive tho&s;e of your daughter.' 'My daughter!' &s;aid Ellen rapturou&s;ly, 'is this my daughter?' The lovely child was already in her arms. 'Deare&s;t infant!' &s;aid Ellen: and, over|come by the pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ollections, a

ri&s;ing &s;ob checked her voice, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears. 'Then you, Madam,' &s;aid &s;he, as &s;oon as &s;he could again &s;peak, and addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the young lady whom &s;he had &s;een at the harp&s;ichord, 'then you, Madam, are not the mother of this beloved baby?' 'Her mother!' returned the lady: 'how cruel has fortune been, thus to make &s;trangers of &s;uch near relations.' 'She is my &s;i&s;ter,' cried Henry, 'my younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, the ex|act image of my Ellen, the darling of my heart.'</P>
<P>There was a que&s;tion which Ellen longed to a&s;k, yet knew not how. The manner and words of Henry, &s;o different from any he had ever u&s;ed &s;ince &s;he became a wife, &s;ugge&s;ted a thought, which &s;he knew not how to expre&s;s; and by the variety of emotions it excited, pre&s;&s;ed upon her heart with a weight which was intolerable. She threw her&s;elf into her father's arms, and, hiding her face in his bo&s;om, 'Oh! my father,' &s;aid &s;he, 'where is Sir William Ackland? Where is my hu&s;band?' 'Be compo&s;ed, deare&s;t creature,' &s;aid Mr. Mordaunt. 'It is perhaps happy for us all, that he can no longer an&s;wer for his conduct in this world.' Ellen became &s;uddenly &s;ick. 'Let me retire, I be&s;eech you,' &s;aid &s;he. Poor unhappy man!' (tears running down her cheeks) 'mi&s;|taken, or cruel, I equally pity you.' Mrs. Ray|mond and Mr. Mordaunt withdrew with Ellen: and Henry accompanied her to the door of Mrs. Raymond's room, carrying the little girl in his arms, from whom Ellen could not bear to be &s;e|parated a &s;ingle moment. Ellen was unable to &s;upport her&s;elf any longer: and, at her own re|que&s;t, &s;he was put to bed, and all parties being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the great outlines of tho&s;e events which it mo&s;t concerned t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to know, all far|ther
<PB N="225" REF="036127_0437_1008534703B95E80">
explanation was, by mutual con&s;ent, deferred. Mrs. Raymond could not con&s;ent to quit Ellen's bed-&s;ide during the night, in &s;pite of her remon|&s;trances, who told her, &s;miling, &s;he was much more accu&s;tomed to be left wholly to her own care, than &s;he could be to &s;pend a night in watch|ing. 'In this bed, in this room,' added &s;he, 'with a table covered as that is, with every thing that can tempt the appetite, or mitigate the pains of &s;ickne&s;s, I am much more likely to be &s;leeple&s;s from a&s;toni&s;hment, than from any fear or want of accommodation.'</P>
<P>Mrs. Raymond, who could not feel the full force of this ob&s;ervation, yet under&s;tood enough of it to be unable to re&s;train her tears, at the thoughts of the former hard&s;hips to which Ellen alluded. 'It &s;eems &s;o impo&s;&s;ible,' returned &s;he, weeping, 'that you &s;hould be really here, that were I to leave you for a moment, I &s;hould not expect to find you on my return.'</P>
<P>Henry was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed by Mr. Mor|daunt, that he mu&s;t not hope to &s;ee Ellen that night, than he &s;et off to the par&s;onage. The tale he had to tell, was &s;o beyond all credibility, that his friends there for &s;ome minutes believed him raving. But &s;eeing nothing in his looks or man|ner to confirm &s;uch an opinion, their feelings be|came little le&s;s agitated than his own. The fact which he &s;o con&s;tantly averred, that Ellen was alive, and at Groby Manor, he pretended not to account for or explain: and though they began to be convinced that he doubted not the truth of what he &s;aid, yet they could not per&s;uade them|&s;elves, that he was not by &s;ome means deceived. They re&s;olved, therefore, to verify his words by the
<PB N="226" REF="036127_0438_100853488CD10D38">
evidence of their own &s;en&s;es: and, late as it was, Mr. and Mrs. Thornton, and Mary, who (although &s;he had been married a twelvemonth) &s;till conti|nued at the par&s;onage, re&s;olved to accompany him to Groby Manor. Mr. Mordaunt had taken his &s;tation in a corner of Ellen's bed-chamber: for to &s;eparate from her he found to be impo&s;&s;ible: and he thought the lo&s;s of &s;leep amply recompen&s;ed by &s;eeing her breathe, and &s;ometimes hearing her &s;peak. Mi&s;s Villars and the two young Ray|monds were in the parlour, waiting the return of Henry. They confirmed to the wondering Thorn|tons the events of the evening: and their mutual joy and a&s;toni&s;hment, with the variety of excla|mations and conjectures that engaged them, &s;o perfectly bani&s;hed all de&s;ire of &s;leep and re&s;t from the whole party, that it was determined they &s;hould &s;it up together for the remainder of the night. Henry and Mary often &s;tole gently to the door of Ellen's room. They li&s;tened. All was quiet. They hoped &s;he &s;lept. They returned to the parlour to communicate their hopes to their friends; and then again crept to the door to con|firm them to them&s;elves. Ellen, however, was &s;leeple&s;s: but the quiet &s;he impo&s;ed on her&s;elf enabled her to collect her thoughts, and to pre|pare for the renewed emotions of the next day.</P>

<P>THE next day at length came: and Ellen found her bed in&s;upportably irk&s;ome to her. She could no longer delay the knowledge of a thou&s;and particulars &s;o intere&s;ting to her, and &s;o important to her happine&s;s: nor was the impatience of her friends much le&s;s than her own. Mrs. Raymond furni&s;hed her with clothes; for whatever Ellen could have done, none of her family would have borne to have &s;een her in tho&s;e tattered and worn-out garments, which were &s;uch painful indications of the hard&s;hips &s;he had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the reflections &s;ugge&s;ted through the whole of Ellen's wakeful night, had been a determination to learn from her father, in a con|ver&s;ation between them&s;elves, all the circum&s;tances attendant on Sir William's death, and the actual &s;ituation of Henry; it having appeared plainly to her, in the few words which &s;he had yet heard him utter, that his &s;entiments towards her were the &s;ame as ever, and that his hopes of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her, were now again ri&s;en as high as in the hap|pie&s;t days of their mutual affection. But Ellen had too long been accu&s;tomed to place the curb of rea&s;on upon her wi&s;hes, to &s;uffer them alone to influence her actions. She had long cea&s;ed to con&s;ider Henry as her lover: but &s;he had never
<PB N="228" REF="036127_0440_10085350E83430C8">
cea&s;ed to entertain for him that friend&s;hip, which his virtues and his love towards her &s;o well de|&s;erved. If affliction had &s;ubdued her pa&s;&s;ions, it had awakened her affections. She was now a mother: and &s;he felt that no con&s;ideration on earth could tempt her to any act which might, in its remote&s;t con&s;equences, be prejudicial to that dear infant, &s;o newly found and &s;o highly che|ri&s;hed. If, in her early youth, &s;he had yielded her partiality for the man of her choice, to a &s;en&s;e of the duty he owed his parent, &s;he well knew now how to make it &s;ubmit to that which &s;he owed her child. But it was po&s;&s;ible that duty and in|clination might at length agree. Ellen's heart flattered her at the thought: but &s;he &s;uffered it not to ri&s;e into a wi&s;h. She would have no wi&s;h on this &s;ubject un&s;anctioned by her father.</P>
<P>Ellen was &s;carcely dre&s;&s;ed, when &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee him: and the enraptured, yet anxious parent, flew to obey her &s;ummons. She begged Mrs. Raymond would leave them together: but &s;he placed her little girl upon her knees. 'I cannot fear,' &s;aid Ellen to her&s;elf, 'any faulty impul&s;e of my heart, while I hold to it this pledge and reward of its rectitude.' As Mr. Mordaunt viewed the languid and travel-worn figure of El|len, as he con&s;idered the palene&s;s of her cheek, and the heavine&s;s of her eye, his emotions almo&s;t choaked him. 'Oh! my child,' &s;aid he, 'what mu&s;t you not have &s;uffered, and for what?' 'Tell me, my father,' &s;aid Ellen, 'how long you have &s;uppo&s;ed me dead?' 'We were taught to believe you died in bringing that infant into the world.' 'And did Sir William appear afflicted for my lo&s;s? and where and how has he lived &s;ince? and, above all, did he not in dying give

you &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e I exi&s;ted?' 'He did not return to England till a twelvemonth after your &s;uppo&s;ed death; and then for the &s;ole pur|po&s;e of placing his child under the care of a rela|tion of his mother's: and it was not until after I had repeatedly urged him, by every motive I could imagine, to afford me the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing him, that I could prevail upon him to make me a vi&s;it. I was then attending your mother in her la&s;t illne&s;s: I could not go to him. He re|mained here only two days, and appeared the mo&s;t wretched of men. I repented that any con&s;ide|ration for &s;elf had induced me to force him into a vi&s;it which &s;eemed &s;o painful to him. Yet there was &s;omething in his grief which ill ac|corded with mine. It had more of fury and de&s;|peration in it than &s;oftne&s;s. Once, and only once, I attempted to lead him to &s;peak of you. He &s;tarted from his chair, "Oh! name her not, &s;he has undone me! &s;he has ruined my peace for ever! Worthy old man," continued he, "you know not how fatal a gift you be&s;towed, when you gave me your daughter!" I believed the violence of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions to be the ravings of grief for a lo&s;s, which my own &s;ufferings told me mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to a hu&s;band be almo&s;t pa&s;t endurance. I entreated he would let me &s;ee my grandchild, the &s;ole remains of Ellen. "She is not like her," returned he. "She does not bear her name. She will not, I hope, bear her features." 'Oh! I hope &s;he will,' returned I fondly: 'and in time, Sir William you will find comfort in what now, perhaps, might be too lively an emblem of what you have lo&s;t.' He &s;eemed almo&s;t convul&s;ed with pa&s;&s;ion: "No more," &s;aid he, "if you would not drive me to madne&s;s." I &s;ought to &s;oothe
<PB N="230" REF="036127_0442_1008535516CC6918">
him: and mo&s;t carefully, during the &s;hort time he afterwards &s;taid with me, did I avoid a &s;ub|ject which I now &s;aw he could not bear. He re|mained &s;ome months in London: and I heard from every one of the deep &s;hade of grief which was impre&s;&s;ed on his behaviour and countenance. He quitted England the following &s;pring, and re|turned to it no more. Four months are &s;carcely pa&s;t &s;ince he died &s;uddenly, with no previous ill|ne&s;s, at Vienna. I was informed of the event by a Bohemian nobleman, whom I under&s;tood to have been Sir William's intimate friend. There were &s;ome words in this gentleman's letter, of which I never, until now, could gue&s;s the mean|ing, but which mu&s;t certainly have alluded to the unhappy mi&s;take, from which my beloved child mu&s;t have &s;uffered &s;o much, and which appears to have made Sir William's life entirely wretched. The&s;e words &s;eemed to intimate, that had Sir William been allowed any time for death-bed re|flections, he might have been induced to have mi|tigated the &s;everity of &s;ome determination, the ju&s;|tice of which had not been &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy him under the rigour of it. I con&s;idered this intima|tion merely as a &s;ort of apology for &s;ome action of Sir William's which might &s;ome time probably come to my knowledge, which his friend was con&s;cious would &s;tand in need of one.'</P>
<P>'I found,' continued Mr. Mordaunt, for Ellen broke not in upon his di&s;cour&s;e, 'that the guar|dians appointed to your dear infant were people unknown to me, and wholly unconnected with my family: and it &s;eemed as if Sir William wi&s;hed to keep her as far apart from every one of us as po&s;|&s;ible. But my heart longed to &s;ee her: and our dear Henry, who has been my guardian-angel under

all my troubles, and is now the &s;upport of my declining age, procured me this ble&s;&s;ing, as he has done many others. He prevailed upon the lady with whom &s;he is placed, to tru&s;t her to the care of his &s;i&s;ter and him&s;elf, when they were about to make a vi&s;it to Northumberland: they have been with me ten days: and there has not been an hour in any one of the&s;e days, in which Henry and I have not &s;oothed our never-cea&s;ing regret, by endeavouring to trace your features in the lineaments of that infant's face.'</P>
<P>Ellen felt that her heart was not indifferent to this panegyric upon Henry. 'And Lord Villars,' a&s;ked &s;he, 'does he &s;till pur&s;ue the &s;ame projects of ambition and avarice, &s;o often defeated but never given up?' 'Lord Villars,' repeated Mr. Mordaunt,' 'do you not know&mdash;but alas! you cannot know&mdash;there is now no other Lord Villars than Henry.' 'Gracious heaven!' &s;aid Ellen; and her pale cheek became &s;till paler. 'He died of a liver complaint about three months ago,' con|tinued Mr. Mordaunt. 'His death was fore&s;een: and Henry cro&s;&s;ed the channel to bring home his &s;i&s;ter, who had been &s;ome time abroad with Lady Edwards: but Lord Villars died before they could return, before indeed Henry had reached the place where his &s;i&s;ter then was. Since his return to England, he has been wholly taken up with his family affairs: and it was not 'till within the&s;e ten days, that he had lei&s;ure to give me, what he knows to be my be&s;t comfort, his dearly beloved &s;ociety.' 'But, dear &s;ir,' &s;aid Ellen, 'my brother, what of him, does he afford you no com|fort?' 'None, Ellen, none. He and lady Al|meria have no reli&s;h for the &s;hades of a northern

retirement, or for the &s;ociety of an old man, though that man is their father. Their life is one unvaried round of di&s;&s;ipation and expence: and the only &s;atisfaction I reap from their union is, &s;ome times the company of &s;ome of their children, of which they have three.' 'My &s;i&s;ters?' &s;aid Ellen. 'Are happily, though not &s;plendidly, married. They are both &s;ettled in this country; and do every thing in their power to make my old age comfortable. My daughter Raymond and her two girls are kind and good to me. And now,' cried he, cla&s;ping her in his arms, '&s;ince I once again embrace my Ellen, there is nothing this world has more to give.' 'And I,' &s;aid Ellen, 'if I can ble&s;s the declining years of my father, and guard the opening dawn of this dear child, what more &s;hall I have to a&s;k in this world?' 'Oh! my Ellen," returned the delighted parent, 'you have much more to a&s;k, and much more to do. You have to reward, I will not &s;ay the con|&s;tancy, for that may be objectionable, but the virtues of our Henry. Happine&s;s too is in long arrears to you: and you may now rea&s;onably a&s;k for payment.' 'But can I,' &s;aid Ellen, 'give my child another parent? Can I hazard her welfare on the &s;hock of intere&s;ts, &s;o often the con&s;equence of a &s;econd connexion?' 'Who would you &s;ooner choo&s;e for a parent to your child,' returned Mr. Mordaunt &s;miling, 'than Henry? Who would you rather make the guardian of your deare&s;t intere&s;t than him? But I leave him to plead his own cau&s;e. My Ellen mu&s;t have un|dergone a wonderful metamorpho&s;is, indeed, if &s;he find in her brea&s;t any impediment to his wi&s;hes from mi&s;taken delicacy, or weak punctilio: and

<P>ELLEN aro&s;e: but &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed, when &s;he came to move, to find her&s;elf &s;o enfeebled and trembling, that &s;he could not but &s;uppo&s;e, had her journey been prolonged one other day, &s;he mu&s;t have &s;unk under the fatigue. But &s;he re|collected not how much more the emotions of the mind exhau&s;t the &s;trength than any labours of the body. What &s;he had undergone, &s;ince her arri|val in Northumberland, had contributed more to|wards the de&s;truction of her bodily powers, than all the hard&s;hips to which a pilgrimage of more than eight hundred miles had expo&s;ed her.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the door of her chamber heard to open by her li&s;tening friends below, than Henry flew up &s;tairs: and &s;eeing her inability to &s;upport her&s;elf, and that Mr. Mordaunt tottered with her weight, 'Let me &s;upport you, my deare&s;t cou&s;in,' &s;aid he. 'It is a relation's office, which you will not deny me.' Ellen, almo&s;t &s;inking, &s;uffered him to put his arms round her; but he was &s;eized
<PB N="235" REF="036127_0447_10085364E9B454A0">
with &s;o violent a &s;it of trembling, that he was obliged for a moment to &s;upport both him&s;elf and her by leaning again&s;t the wall. Ellen had been appri&s;ed, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Thorntons were below: and they, therefore, having no fear of her &s;uffering from the &s;urpri&s;e of their &s;udden appearance, could no longer re&s;train their impatience, but ha&s;|tily followed Henry up &s;tairs. It was fortunate they did &s;o: for &s;o great had his emotion become, that he could not have &s;upported Ellen another moment. Mr. Thornton cla&s;ped his arms round her: the beloved Mary received her &s;inking head upon her bo&s;om; while Mrs. Thornton, half frantic with her joy, deluged her with perfumed water one moment, and &s;tifled her with care&s;&s;es the next. A moment's con&s;ideration convinced them all, that Ellen was unfit to be removed down &s;tairs. They therefore agreed to a&s;&s;emble in Mr. Mor|daunt's library, which was immediately oppo&s;ite the bed chamber a&s;&s;igned to Ellen. Henry could not, however, prevail upon him&s;elf again to quit her: and having regained &s;teadier nerves, he car|ried her, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Thornton, into the library, where being laid upon a &s;ofa, a few moments &s;ufficed to recompo&s;e her mind.</P>
<P>'I could not have &s;u&s;pected my&s;elf of &s;o much debility,' &s;aid &s;he &s;miling, 'and when I come to tell you what I have been doing for the la&s;t three months, you will agree with me, that I have little right to &s;uch fine lady-like airs.' 'Oh!' cried Henry fervently, 'you are weak. We all are weak from feelings no fine lady ever knew.' In|deed the groupe who were now gathered round Ellen, &s;eemed to have forgotten all con&s;ideration of &s;elf, in the thoughts of the beloved object they encircled. Mr. Mordaunt had drawn a low &s;tool
<PB N="236" REF="036127_0448_100853667349FD58">
clo&s;e to the &s;ofa; and held Ellen's hands in his. Henry was leaning over the back of it, with his eyes intently fixed upon her face. Mary was upon her knees, pre&s;&s;ing clo&s;e up between Mr. Mordaunt and Ellen; while the re&s;t of the party had di&s;po&s;ed of them&s;elves into a kind of outward circle, and all were alike emulative of the plea&s;ure of admini&s;tering to Ellen's wants. One idea &s;eemed to prevail with them all, that the mi&s;eries &s;he had &s;uffered, and the hard&s;hips &s;he had under|gone, called for every indemnification in their power. Ellen had &s;carcely any voice, and, bathed in tears, was unable to look up. 'I have not,' &s;aid &s;he, in broken and interrupted accents, 'in all my &s;orrows, &s;hed &s;o many tears from grief, as I now &s;hed from joy. But indeed I mu&s;t not indulge my&s;elf. I mu&s;t &s;hake off this weakne&s;s. Yet who can wonder that the &s;en&s;e of the mercies I have received, is &s;o overcoming?'</P>
<P>Impatient as the whole circle were to be ac|quainted with the every particular of Ellen's fate, they all, with one voice, declared again&s;t the indul|gence of their curio&s;ity 'till &s;he was &s;omewhat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore re&s;tored to compo&s;ure. But &s;he was aware, that this would never be, while &s;he had &s;o inte|re&s;ting a &s;tory to relate. 'Believe me,' &s;aid &s;he, 'that nothing is &s;o likely to hu&s;h the&s;e contending feelings as the dullne&s;s of narrative. I &s;hall per|haps fatigue my&s;elf with the length of my &s;tory: but &s;uch fatigue will be &s;alutary. I want &s;leep. Mine has been long broken, and for the two la&s;t nights wholly interrupted. If I can talk my&s;elf to &s;leep, there is nothing from which I &s;hall re|ceive &s;o much benefit: and to &s;leep, while I have &s;uch a &s;tory to tell, is impo&s;&s;ible.'</P>
<P>The party drew clo&s;er round her: and Henry,
<PB N="237" REF="036127_0449_1008536978C9B458">
half invited, found a &s;eat on the &s;ofa, at her feet, as, &s;upported by pillows, &s;he changed her po&s;ture from that of lying down to a &s;itting one. It can|not be doubted what were the emotions with which Ellen was li&s;tened to. Pity, admiration, grief, indignation, and a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;ucceeded each other: but when &s;he came to relate the cir|cum&s;tance which &s;eemed to have &s;ealed her fate, and of which being ab&s;olutely ignorant, &s;he was at a lo&s;s whether to impute it to mi&s;take, or contri|vance, Henry, in an agony he could not re&s;train, threw him&s;elf on his knees before her. 'Oh! my Ellen,' cried he, gra&s;ping her hands, 'my &s;uffering, my ever-beloved Ellen, do not, do not hate me! I am the wretch who have undone you. I conducted you to that hateful pri&s;on. I clo&s;ed its doors upon you. Your agonizing days, your &s;leeple&s;s nights, were all the gift of my hand. But, Oh! if you cannot pardon me, do not, do not hate me.' 'Oh! Henry,' replied Ellen, gently returning the pre&s;&s;ure of his hand, 'be a&s;&s;ured I never entertained a &s;entiment of <HI>hatred,</HI> even to|wards the <HI>real</HI> author of my &s;ufferings. How then &s;hould I hate <HI>you?</HI>' 'And can you forgive me? And do you call me your dear Henry? Mr. Thornton pray for me: I &s;hall not keep my &s;en&s;es.' 'Nor,' &s;aid Mr. Thornton fervently, '&s;uffer Ellen to keep hers. Can you admire the &s;trength of mind, which has &s;upported her through&punc; &s;uch trying &s;cenes, and yet de&s;ert your&s;elf &s;o pi|tiably?' 'But I was not tried with joy,' &s;aid Ellen, holding out her hands towards Henry (who had ha&s;tily let them go, on hearing Mr. Thornton's rebuke), 'and tho&s;e, who have felt them both, know how much more difficult it is to bear joy
<PB N="238" REF="036127_0450_1008536C70F3C8B8">
than &s;orrow.' Henry's tears rolled down his cheeks. He endeavoured to conceal his face as he &s;tooped to ki&s;s again and again the dear hands he held. 'Say,' cried he, in accents &s;carcely ar|ticulate, '&s;ay you forgive me for all my faults.' 'Let us not talk of forgivene&s;s,' returned Ellen: 'and but this once &s;uffer me to a&s;&s;ure you, that you have lightened my heart of the &s;ingle remain|ing weight that oppre&s;&s;ed it, by clearing the me|mory of a man whom I would not condemn from the imputation of the only act of <HI>villainy</HI> with which I could charge him. It is ea&s;y to pardon injuries originating in mi&s;take, and a mi&s;take too, which I under&s;tand has co&s;t the unhappy per&s;on &s;o deceived &s;till more than it has co&s;t me.' Henry then explained how fatally his &s;crupulous atten|tion to the delicacy and peace of Ellen had &s;uc|ceeded. He remembered the contents of lady Almeria's note; though he could not at that di&s;|tance of time call to mind the exact terms of it, upon which Sir William's mi&s;take was grounded. The good heart of Mr. Mordaunt rejoiced equally with Ellen's, that there was &s;o &s;trong an appear|ance of impropriety in the conduct of Henry, as to ju&s;tify the confirmation it had given to tho&s;e injurious &s;u&s;picions which had, however, been before mo&s;t unju&s;tifiably taken up. Without &s;uch an apology, Sir William mu&s;t have appeared one of the wor&s;t of men. But neither Mr. Mordaunt, nor the chri&s;tian Mr. Thornton, much le&s;s could Henry, admit of any excu&s;e for the method he had taken to gratify his revenge, nor the right he had a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf of &s;o cruelly puni&s;hing offences for which the laws of his country have appointed a much le&s;s &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement. Nor will it be expected that the females of the party were more
<PB N="239" REF="036127_0451_1008536E4FEA3BE8">
favourable to &s;o <HI>illegal</HI> a proceeding: and Ellen, though &s;he did not choo&s;e to join in the condem|nation, entered not into defence of a conduct which &s;he con&s;idered as indefen&s;ible. In men|tioning the adventure in the ruined mona&s;tery, &s;he carefully avoided mentioning the name of Mr. Raymond, though &s;he expatiated on the happy circum&s;tance it had proved to her, in procuring her the ducat, which &s;he had found of &s;o much u&s;e. It was with the greate&s;t emotion that &s;he re|lated what &s;he had felt on the &s;ight of Henry at Cologne. 'And could you, did you,' echoed from every mouth, in &s;uch 'circum&s;tances, in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, could you &s;uffer him to depart without making your&s;elf known to him?' 'What could I do?' cried Ellen, in a tone of &s;elf-defence. 'What power on earth could have convinced Sir William of my innocence, had I returned to England with Henry? And would you have had me barter my reputation, and my only chance of happine&s;s, for an e&s;cape from hard&s;hips which I had already proved not to be in&s;upportable? But God only knows what it co&s;t me to make the choice I did!' 'The choice!' &s;aid Mr. Mordaunt rapturou&s;ly, 'the choice was like your&s;elf. It was the re&s;ult of the pure&s;t principle and the &s;teadie&s;t rea&s;on. But this &s;tory will kill us all. For God's &s;ake make ha&s;te to arrive in England, or I too &s;hall incur Mr. Thornton's cen&s;ure; for my brain will hardly bear it.' 'Mr. Thornton,' &s;aid mrs. Thornton, &s;obbing, 'has little rea&s;on to reproach you. Look at him; did you ever &s;ee him &s;o moved before?' 'Oh! who would not be moved,' &s;aid Mr. Thornton, 'at &s;uch a proof of the &s;trength of rectitude, and the power of rea&s;on? And yet, wonderful as it appears, it is
<PB N="240" REF="036127_0452_1008537143CAF280">
in the power of every one to whom God has given common under&s;tanding, and has not cur&s;ed with unnatural depravity, to act as uprightly and heroi|cally as Ellen has done. All the re&s;t is the re&s;ult of cultivation, or &s;elf di&s;cipline, and of a continued habit of referring all our actions to principle.' 'My ever dear preceptor,' &s;aid Ellen, 'if I have been able to act rightly, I owe it to you, to my dear mrs. Thornton, to my father; but chiefly I will &s;ay to <HI>you,</HI> who, never &s;paring of your prai&s;e when I de&s;erved commendation, gave it always with the &s;ame judgment you have now done; and by convincing me the path of virtue was practica|ble to all, made me a&s;hamed to repre&s;ent it to my&s;elf as difficult.' Henry could not &s;peak: he &s;at with his face re&s;ted upon the arm of the &s;ofa, in a &s;tate of emotion that &s;hook his whole frame. He heard not mr. Thornton's moral. He gave no credit to the ea&s;y practicability of &s;uch virtues as Ellen's. He thought her an angel, and that it was &s;carcely among her fellow angels that &s;he was to be equalled. Ellen ha&s;tened to conclude a narrative, the circum&s;tances of which &s;o deeply affected her auditors. She was happy to have the ta&s;k over; and felt her&s;elf more capable of com|po&s;ure and re&s;t when it was done. She now learnt, what from the multiplicity of events each &s;ide had to communicate, had hitherto remained untold; that the unhappy Mr. Raymond had met the fate his vices provoked; and that in&s;tead of the &s;afe retreat he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf in Swit|zerland, the vengeance of an injured family had overtaken him in a few days from the time when Ellen had left him.

be made good, but which was conducted with &s;o much violence and danger to his opponents, as had obliged them to attempt &s;ubduing him by means as de&s;perate as tho&s;e he had u&s;ed in his de|fence. In this &s;truggle he had received wounds which proved mortal in a few days. His death had put Mrs. Raymond in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall jointure; and had &s;ecured to his daughters the few thou&s;and pounds which had been &s;ettled upon them. Ellen now revealed, that it was to Mr. Raymond that &s;he owed the &s;ea&s;onable relief which &s;he had before mentioned; and expatiated on the earne&s;t de&s;ire that he had &s;hewn of being farther &s;erviceable to her. To hear of &s;uch prai&s;e-worthy di&s;po&s;itions in a man whom &s;he had once loved, was very acceptable to Mrs. Raymond. But as ill u&s;age had long ago worn out her affection for him; his death had rather &s;hocked than afflicted her: and in the pre&s;ent happier pro&s;pects of her family, &s;he &s;oon learnt to con&s;ider it rather as a relea&s;e than a misfortune. Ellen's two other &s;i&s;ters joined the happy party at Groby Manor the next day; and mo&s;t unfeignedly partook of the joy that reigned there.

<P>AND now what avails it to prolong a narra|tive, the conclu&s;ion of which is already antici|pated? Oppo&s;ed by no one duty, &s;upported by her own wi&s;hes, &s;anctioned by the authority of a parent, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that Henry's revived claim to the hand and heart of Ellen was di&s;al|lowed? Yet did &s;he feel an un&s;peakable reluctance to becoming his wife, until her reputation was as &s;potle&s;s as her life. Her return to exi&s;tence mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be known; and with it mu&s;t be known the &s;u&s;picions which had &s;o long held her in &s;eclu|&s;ion from the world. The death of Sir William made her vindication difficult; &s;ince no one could be a&s;&s;ured of her innocence, but tho&s;e who would naturally &s;creen her guilt. The mo&s;t unequivocal te&s;timony was that of the Bohemian nobleman, and to him it was re&s;olved to apply; Henry de|termining that if the matter could not be &s;ettled &s;atisfactorily by letter, he would him&s;elf take a journey to Vienna. Mr. Mordaunt drew up a plain &s;tatement of all the facts upon which he had rea&s;on to think Sir William had grounded Ellen's condemnation: lady Almeria's te&s;timony on tho&s;e which had &s;eemingly been &s;uch unequivocal marks
<PB N="243" REF="036127_0455_1008537A3686F430">
of her guilt was added thereto: and the nobleman was entreated to declare, whether Sir William laid any thing more to her charge than this ex|planation obviated. The natural eloquence of a parent trembling for the reputation of his child, gave an energy to Mr. Mordaunt's entreaties and remon&s;trances, which mu&s;t have affected any heart not wholly callous. The heart of the Bo|hemian was not of this nature. He had long en|tertained doubts of the guilt of a woman to who&s;e excellencies Sir William's never-cea&s;ing regrets had done reluctant ju&s;tice: and &s;ince her e&s;cape, he had received &s;uch proofs from Mrs. Ulric of the purity of her mind and the goodne&s;s of her principles, as had well prepared him for the vin|dication of her conduct which he now received. The an&s;wer he returned was the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>He informed Mr. Mordaunt, that Sir William him&s;elf had frequently declared, in the la&s;t months of his life, that, were it po&s;&s;ible, he could have been mi&s;taken in what his own &s;en&s;es had wit|ne&s;&s;ed, he &s;hould be per&s;uaded he had wronged the unfortunate Ellen; that remor&s;e for the &s;everity of the puni&s;hment he had inflicted, even &s;uppo&s;|ing her guilty, had haunted every hour of his life; that he &s;eemed not unfrequently to regret the &s;trictne&s;s with which his orders, not to convey any letter or me&s;&s;age to him from her, had been ob&s;erved; that nothing withheld him from again &s;eeking her, but the in&s;upportable &s;hame which mu&s;t have overwhelmed him, either had &s;he been able to have cleared her&s;elf from the crimes im|puted to her, or which would have attended his re&s;toring her to the world, guilty or innocent; and that, finally, even the dread of this &s;hame
<PB N="244" REF="036127_0456_1008537BD19DA0D8">
would probably have given way to the increa&s;ing wretchedne&s;s of his mind, had his life been &s;pared a little longer.</P>
<P>The Bohemian &s;tated it as having been his own intention, after the death of his friend, to have vi&s;ited Ellen in her pri&s;on, and from the opinion which he &s;hould have been able to have formed of her from &s;uch an interview, to have regulated his own future conduct, as to the continuation of her impri&s;onment, or the putting a &s;peedy and final end to it. He ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed, that though, had he found her innocent, he &s;hould have held his friend's reputation as nothing when compared with the inju&s;tice and cruelty of detain|ing her any longer a captive; yet, that had &s;he appeared to him guilty, he &s;hould have preferred &s;uffering her to langui&s;h out her life in perpetual confinement, to the fixing &s;uch a &s;tain upon Sir William's memory, as her re&s;toration to the world and the publication of the whole &s;tory mu&s;t have done.</P>
<P>The generous Bohemian after congratulating the happy father on the innocence and e&s;cape of his daughter, informed him, that in order that no cloud might ob&s;cure a happine&s;s &s;o dearly pur|cha&s;ed and &s;o amply de&s;erved, he had written a full vindication of her character, to the guardian of her child, and the tru&s;tees of her &s;ettlement: and this he had done, he &s;aid, not more from a conviction that by &s;uch a te&s;timony to her virtues he offered the mo&s;t acceptable proof of his invio|lable attachment to his decea&s;ed friend, than from the a&s;&s;urance he had in his own mind, that he was offering a tribute to truth, and from the plea&s;ure which re&s;ulted to him&s;elf, in an act of ju&s;tice and compen&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="036127_0457_10085381A3AE9908">In con&s;equence of this well-judged and generous interference of the amiable Bohemian, Ellen found no difficulty in having her daughter given to her wi&s;hes. By this agency &s;he was enabled al&s;o to acquit her&s;elf, as far as money could acquit her, of obligations to the good Mrs. Ulric and the faithful There&s;a; nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the grand&s;on of old Deborah was forgotten. Henry, in the ample provi&s;ion which his di&s;intere&s;ted heart had apportioned to every branch of his fa|mily, had left him&s;elf poor: but he had more than &s;ufficient for happine&s;s. He revived the &s;cheme which, &s;o many years before, he had pre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much fruitle&s;s earne&s;tne&s;s. Ellen and he re|&s;olved to content them&s;elves with her jointure, until his e&s;tate had cleared it&s;elf of every incum|brance: and, at the earne&s;t entreaty of Mr. Mor|daunt, they took up their abode at Groby Manor. The cottage of old Deborah was enlarged, and fitted up for the reception of Mrs. Raymond and her daughters, that they might (while always mo&s;t welcome to Groby Manor) have a place to retire to, when under the dominion of that wi&s;h which is felt at times by every human mind, the wi&s;h, that as we &s;hut the door upon us we may be able to &s;ay, 'Now I am at home.' Of the happine&s;s of Henry and Ellen, of the feelings of Mr. Mor|daunt, of the contentment of the Thorntons, and of the peace and &s;atisfaction of all within the reach of their benevolence, it were needle&s;s to tell. To tho&s;e who have hearts and principles &s;imilar to theirs all that could be &s;aid would be &s;uperfluous: to tho&s;e of oppo&s;ite feelings and opinions it would be unintelligible.</P>

<P>"The author addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf in this publication chiefly to tho&s;e of the middle rank, becau&s;e &s;he thinks them mo&s;t in a natural &s;tate. She wi&s;hes to point out in what true dignity con&s;i&s;ts&mdash;to per&s;uade women to endeavour to acquire &s;trength of mind and body, and to convince them that the &s;oft phra&s;es "&s;u&s;ceptibility of heart, delicacy of &s;entiment," &amp;c. are &s;ynonimous with epithets of weakne&s;s; and that tho&s;e beings which are objects of pity, and that kind of love which has been termed its &s;i&s;ter, will &s;oon become objects of con|tempt.</P>
<P>"It is with &s;ome reluctance that for the pre&s;ent we take our leave of this &s;ingular, and, on the whole, ex|cellent production. The &s;ubjects which it inve&s;tigates, are of the utmo&s;t importance to human nature, and we &s;hould be wanting in our engagements, and in our duty, if we pa&s;&s;ed it over too &s;lightly. We have no doubt if even our cotemporaries &s;hould fail to do her ju&s;tice, po&s;terity will compen&s;ate the defect; and have no he&s;itation in declaring, that if the bulk of the great truths, which this publication contains, were reduced to practice, the nation would be better, wi&s;er, and

<HEAD>5. WOLSTONECRAFT'S LETTERS FROM SWEDEN, DENMARK AND NORWAY. Price <HI>75</HI> cents.</HEAD>
<P>"A vigorous and cultivated intellect ea&s;ily accommo|dates it&s;elf to new occupations. The notion, that in|dividual genius can only excel in one thing, is a vulgar error. A mind endued by nature with &s;trong powers and quick &s;en&s;ibility, and by culture furni&s;hed in an un|common degree with habits of attention and reflection, wherever it is placed, will find it&s;elf employments; and whatever it undertakes, will execute it well. Af|ter the repeated proofs, which the ingenious and ju&s;tly admired writer of tho&s;e letters has given to the public, that her talents are far above the ordinary level, it will not be thought &s;urpri&s;ing, that &s;he &s;hould excel in different kinds of writing; that the qualifications which have enabled her to in&s;truct young people by moral le&s;&s;ons and tales, and to furni&s;h the philo&s;opher with original and important &s;peculations, &s;hould al&s;o em|power her to entertain and intere&s;t the public, in a manner peculiarly her own, by writing a book of tra|vels.</P>
<P>"We have no he&s;itation in a&s;&s;uring our readers, that Mrs. W. has done this in the pre&s;ent volume: her active mind has, throughout her tour, been awake to every object and occurrence. She has been at no lo&s;s to find in every new &s;ituation &s;omething intere&s;ting to de&s;|cribe, or &s;ome occa&s;ion for ju&s;t reflection. The letters

But from a mind well &s;tored, and exerci&s;ed, as this writer's, the ea&s;y and un&s;olicited effu&s;ions of the moment, in a work of this kind, are preferable to artificial arrange|ments. "In order to avoid becoming &s;tiff and af|fected, I determined" &s;ays Mrs. W. "to let my re|marks and reflections flow unre&s;trained, as I perceived that I could not give a ju&s;t de&s;cription of what I &s;aw, but by relating the effect different objects have pro|duced on my mind and feelings whil&s;t the impre&s;&s;ions were &s;till fre&s;h." Her plan as &s;tated by her&s;elf was &s;imply to endeavour to give a ju&s;t view of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the countries &s;he has pa&s;&s;ed through, as far as &s;he could obtain information during &s;o &s;hort a re&s;idence; avoiding tho&s;e details, which without being very u&s;eful to travellers, who follow the &s;ame route, appear very in&s;ipid to tho&s;e who only accompany you in the chair."</P>

<P>"The tales, as a &s;eries of moral le&s;&s;ons, are ex|cellent. They are of a nature &s;ufficiently &s;uited to afford amu&s;ement; and at the &s;ame time are happily adapted to fix upon the heart &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions in fa|vour of amiable and virtuous manners: they are not fetched out of the wilds of fancy, nor out of the clouds of ab&s;traction, but from the common walks of life: they inculcate no romantic or impracticable maxims of conduct, but the plain principles of u&s;eful morality: they abound with amu&s;ing incidents, and are connected by a continued cour&s;e of narration, which is both more agreeable in the peru&s;al, and, better remem|rered, than a mi&s;cellaneous collection of &s;hort and de|tached &s;tories: the &s;tyle in which they are written is correct and ea&s;y; and the whole is enlivened by a great variety of prints, which are well executed, and which have this peculiar excellence, that almo&s;t every plate

<P>"In the mid&s;t of the numerous attempts which in the pre&s;ent age of &s;peculation and controver&s;y are made to enlighten the under&s;tanding, the cultivation of the heart is perhaps too much neglected. It is with plea&s;ure that we find our attention called to a work of which the principal objects appear to be, to impre&s;s the hearts of men with ju&s;t &s;entiments re&s;pecting hu|man life and manners, and to conduct them, by the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t direct path, to the true happine&s;s of rational beings.
