<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS, and FELLOW-SUBJECTS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE poi&s;ons which have lately been too la|vi&s;hly &s;cattered among you, call aloud for an antidote; and by their operations they appear to be of &s;o deadly a kind as to re|quire the immediate counteraction of &s;ome powerfully efficient recipe; till &s;uch an one is produced, a le&s;s forcible pre&s;cription may, by &s;topping their progre&s;s, be found &s;alutary.</P>
<P>Of late two pamphlets have appeared, the authors of which the contending parties of this country &s;eem to con&s;ider as the invulnerable champions of their dif|ferent principles and intere&s;ts, and each has therefore naturally attracted the attention of its friends and oppo&s;ers; but the zeal of the whigs, in di&s;per&s;ing abroad their boa&s;ted and favourite production, has far out&s;tripped that of the tories, who perhaps, not con&s;idering an appeal to the head as &s;o adapted to the purpo&s;es of party as one to the heart, have not in&s;erted the Friendly Addre&s;s in a News-Paper;&mdash;have not con&s;iderably reduced its price; or &s;ent it abroad gratis, as a &s;timulus to their friends<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is ob&s;ervable in the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, de&s;igned for general u&s;e, it has been thought advi&s;eable to omit one of the be&s;t turned and be&s;t de&s;erved compliments to an officer of high rank, that, in the compa&s;s of a &s;mall reading, I as yet remem|ber to have &s;een:&mdash;Such in&s;iduous arts, and &s;uch want of can|dor are inex<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">able, and would di&s;grace the noble&s;t of cau&s;es.</NOTE>: The&s;e

being the honours which party has conferred on the &s;trictures on that performance, it may not be una|mu&s;ing or unprofitable to examine on what founda|tion this boa&s;ted bulwark of faction is erected. This writer, like a true di&s;ciple of the noble author of the Characteri&s;tics, tries every thing by the touch|&s;tone of ridicule; but does he know that it can place all &s;ubjects, even the &s;acred precepts and my&s;teries of our holy religion, in the &s;ame point of view; and like the jaundiced eye, &s;eeing through a tainted me|dium, reduce all objects, however varied in colours, to its own loath&s;ome hue? He commences with a no|table di&s;covery from unerring &s;igns, of his antagoni&s;t's profe&s;&s;ion; but I much query if any one, from his &s;ub&s;equent ob&s;ervations, would be induced to con|&s;ider him a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>The friends of Briti&s;h government in America are, I tru&s;t, not &s;o contemptible as the picture of this &s;tricturer would ludicrou&s;ly di&s;play them; many have already declared their attachment to its cau&s;e, and fifty times their numbers, at pre&s;ent overwhelm|ed by popular fury, would in the day of trial avow it: I wi&s;h not to &s;ee <HI>royal &s;tandards erected or &s;words flaming in the front and in the rear,</HI> but alas! the melancholy face of affairs on this continent too &s;trong|ly indicates it; and then I am convinced the regular troops would not on experience be found &s;o contemp|tible as he endeavours to repre&s;ent them; or that co|lony forces could be &s;o ea&s;ily rai&s;ed and di&s;ciplined as he a&s;&s;erts: A <HI>&s;implification</HI> of manoeuvres that can be learnt in <HI>three months,</HI> will not bring you, Americans, to that &s;teadine&s;s, that you &s;hall with re|gularity and compo&s;ure, like the Engli&s;h troops at Fontenoy, evolute in the face of a victorious and &s;u|perior army: For my part, I will go further than

even this rapid in&s;tructor, and engage to teach &s;chool-boys, with wooden guns on their &s;houlders, <HI>to form and reduce from a line of fire to a line of impre&s;&s;ion</HI> in half an hour; but to train men for war requires la|bour, experience and time; and to reduce them to perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to every &s;uperior, is with difficulty effected in legal e&s;tabli&s;hments, never in popular and tumultuous a&s;&s;ociations; deprived of that coer&s;ive power which in the former produces obedience, their leaders in vain &s;eek by attentions and courte&s;ies that compliance with their commands which the others de|rive from e&s;tabli&s;hed undi&s;puted authority.</P>
<P>A yeomanry like the American, the mo&s;t happy and comfortable of any in the world, are but ill pre|pared to &s;upport the fatigues, dangers and wants of long campaigns; they would &s;oop mi&s;s tho&s;e &s;olaces which dome&s;tic tranquility afforded them, and would revert to their pri&s;tine avocations and delights; their acquaintance with the u&s;e of implements of husbandry would &s;tand them in but little &s;tead, for to what purpo&s;e &s;hould they employ them? It has long been acknow|ledged a principle in war, that irregulars are not cal|culated for defence, but attack; their vigour and intrepidity may bear down all ob&s;tacles to the latter, but too &s;urely they will fail in that patience and per|&s;everance which is indi&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite for the for|mer. When the New-England provincials, under General Pepperrell, in the year forty-five, attacked Louisbourg, they laughed at the regular methods of approach propo&s;ed to them, and by a concurrence of fortunate circum&s;tances, united to valour, carried that important fortre&s;s; this is a fact which many of them can vouch, and mo&s;t if not all the re&s;t of them have heard repeatedly from their fathers, when recount|ing the archievements of their youthful days; and

they mu&s;t then have al&s;o told them, that the petulance of their brave countrymen was more than once on the point of giving up that glorious enterpri&s;e.&mdash;Con|&s;ider therefore, I adjure you, by tho&s;e ties and rela|tions which endear life, and &s;trow flowers along the rugged path of its pilgrimage; con&s;ider, before you engage in an attempt of &s;o &s;erious, &s;o hazardous a nature, as the oppo&s;ing a royal and long con&s;tituted army, what may rea&s;onably be expected from forces &s;o liable to defections as the unre&s;trained and ha&s;tily levied troops of the&s;e colonies mu&s;t ever be: Your numbers are al&s;o held forth to you as powerful and unconquerable, and I do not deny that on &s;o extend|ed a continent as this many armies of forty-thou&s;and each might, in the various operations of a war, to ad|vantage be employed; but &s;uppo&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible for this even to be the ca&s;e, what mu&s;t be its unavoidable con&s;equences? All your pea&s;antry being engaged in martial expeditions, the land would want its culture, and a dearth in a very few months mu&s;t infallibly en|&s;ue, which would deprive your &s;oldiers of even ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;tenance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To &s;trengthen this ob&s;ervation, Germany la&s;t war afforded melancholy proofs to what di&s;tre&s;s a country is reduced, when occupied by contending armies.</NOTE>, for they mu&s;t forego at the com|mencement every idea and wi&s;h for their accu&s;tomed luxuries: Are you yet to be told that there are di&s;|ca&s;es which are endemic to a camp, and that when famine with "baneful &s;mile" &s;talks through its ave|nues &s;he will add fre&s;h poignancy and malignancy to its in&s;eparable di&s;orders? From mo&s;t of the&s;e evils your opponents will be free; from long practice their con&s;titutions are habituated to the fatigues of the mo&s;t rigid di&s;cipline, they may feel di&s;temper but they are better enabled to repel it than you, unu&s;ed to hard|&s;hips

&s;hips, can po&s;&s;ibly be; nor will they be haunted by the &s;malle&s;t dread of want; your ports, blocked up by the navy of England, though denying you relief, will afford them plentiful &s;upplies, and in ca&s;e of de|feat a mo&s;t &s;ure retreat till augmented by numerous and powerful reinforcements; for remember, that Great-Britain, during la&s;t war, did at one time carry conque&s;t through every quarter of the globe, and that you a&s;&s;i&s;ted her only in this.</P>
<P>Hitherto, Americans, I have only pointed out to you the in&s;tability of your own force; it behoves you as you have examined how far you can rely with &s;afety on it to change the &s;cene, and &s;ee how it &s;tands oppo&s;ed to that of your antagoni&s;ts, and here the pro&s;pect is different, taught to conquer by di&s;cipline, they firmly confide in what they know is irre&s;i&s;table; and not di&s;tracted by jarring principles and move|ments; with them every part of the machine acts in harmony and concord, and every &s;pring and every wheel con&s;pires to produce its nece&s;&s;ary efficient force.</P>
<P>It matters not of what per&s;ons armies are compo&s;|ed, &s;ince the profe&s;&s;ion has a natural tendency to cre|ate in them new principles and ideas of fortitude, &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion and reliance on the wi&s;dom and experience of their &s;uperiors: Your informant has told you the Briti&s;h troops are made up of <HI>"the mo&s;t debauched weavers prentices, the &s;cum of the Iri&s;h Roman Catholics who de&s;ert upon every occa&s;ion, and a few, very few Scotch who are not &s;trong enough to carry packs."</HI> I have cultivated an acquaintance with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the military gentlemen, and have found them men of candour and worth; from their information and my own ob&s;ervation, I will now in the&s;e particulars lay before you a true and impartial

&s;tate of the Briti&s;h army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer of the Strictures in &s;tating the number of the Briti&s;h infantry, has, either through negligence or purpo&s;ely, committed an error, by not including the marines: Their e&s;|tabli&s;hment is, I think, upwards of four thou&s;and. This corps, though exi&s;ting under a different act of Parliament, may pro|perly be denominated an addition to the marching regiments, as in the expeditions of la&s;t war it frequently co-operated with them, and by its vigour and intrepidity contributed to their memorable &s;ucce&s;&s;es. This is only produced as an in&s;tance of what occurs in every page, unfair rea&s;oning from mi&s;repre&s;ent|ed facts; for a trifling peace e&s;tabli&s;hment is not to be comput|ed the force of Britain,&mdash;it is founded on a plan, recommended by Mar&s;hall Saxe for the French army, of having many batta|lions with more officers to each than requi&s;ite for the number of private men, that in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, new levies might be in|grafted on them, and by that means a con&s;iderable body of troops, fit for actual &s;ervice, be almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly com|pleated.</NOTE>: If that part which Eng|land affords is only <HI>the mo&s;t debauched weavers prentices,</HI> whence ari&s;es the great intere&s;t which the friends of many of them have with the country gentlemen, and which is often powerfully employed in &s;oliciting their di&s;charges? And by what arts have &s;o many apprentices, without detection, de&s;erted their ma&s;ters, and broke their indentures? But all recruit|ing officers, and I &s;u&s;pect the Stricturer can affirm it, know that it is the country and not the towns which completes their battalions, that they beat up only on market-days when pea&s;ants not mechanics re&s;ort to them; and you can all of you judge from the appear|ance of tho&s;e recruits which have been brought hi|ther, if they were the produce of villages or cities. <HI>The &s;cum of the Iri&s;h Roman Catholics,</HI> he tells you, forms the proportion from that country, but unfortu|nately two &s;trong circum&s;tances militate again&s;t this a&s;&s;ertion, for the legi&s;lature of Ireland, from fatal ex|perience, jealous of the Roman Catholics, has, under

For mo&s;t &s;urely he has been &s;trangely mi&s;informed; of the little army &s;ta|tioned in this capital there are two of the Quebec, and one of the Minden battalions, in which many of the officers and &s;oldiers who conquered on tho&s;e glo|rious days &s;till remain, and in mo&s;t of the other re|giments which compo&s;e it many of the veterans of la&s;t war are to be found; and for my own part when I view this &s;mall but finely appointed army, and con|&s;ider that it is under the command of two Generals of approved knowledge and experience in war, I feel much confidence in the difficulties it would be able to furmount, and the victories over irregulars which, in human probability, it would a&s;&s;uredly obtain.</P>
<P>In order to induce in you a belief of his military principles and knowledge, he produces an in&s;tance in proof from the con&s;titution of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's army, but even was it, which I have the greate&s;t rea|&s;on to doubt, literally as he has &s;tated, it cannot then, I apprehend, be brought as a precedent in this ca&s;e, for there is no &s;imilarity between the connected and ab&s;olute power of that monarch over all his dominions and the di&s;tinct and widely &s;eparated colonies of North-America: Between &s;upporting the autho|rity of the lawful Sovereign and rebelling again&s;t him.</P>
<P>He tells you al&s;o, that <HI>no inferences can be drawn</HI> from the conque&s;t of Quebec by the army under Ge|neral Wolfe, but believe me he is much mi&s;taken, for la&s;t war will afford abundant proofs to the contra|ry:
