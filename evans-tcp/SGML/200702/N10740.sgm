<P>The true con&s;titutional mode of connecting Bri|ri&s;h dominions, that are otherwi&s;e &s;eparated by na|ture, is demon&s;trated by the e&s;tabli&s;hed example of the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, which, by long experience, has proved to be &s;ufficiently effec|tual. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, indeed, that an act of Parliament was made in the 6th of George 1. chap. 5. wherein it is laid down, that <Q>the King and Parliament of Great-Britain may make laws to bind Ireland.</Q><NOTE N="(22)" PLACE="foot"><P>If the preceding arguments are not &s;ufficient to prove in what light the &s;aid Act is to be con&s;idered, yet the pre&s;ent di&s;tinct and &s;eparate juri&s;diction of the Iri&s;h Parliament, the continuation of their ancient and con&s;titutional privileges, notwith&s;tanding the doctrine a&s;&s;erted in the &s;aid Act, and their annual tran&s;actions, both in taxation and legi&s;lation, are facts which prove (better than arguments) that the people of Ire|land have an inherent right to enact laws independant of the Briti&s;h Parliament; otherwi&s;e the King's a&s;&s;ent would not be &s;ufficient to render the &s;aid laws valid and binding without the e&s;pecial approbation and con&s;ent al&s;o of the Briti&s;h Parliament, which indeed is never required; &s;o far is it from being nece&s;&s;ary! And, farther, the inhabitants of Great-Britain would think it extremely unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t, if the Parliament of Ire|land &s;hould claim a right of making laws, with the King's a&s;&s;ent, to bind any part of this i&s;land! The argument is re|ciprocal; &s;o that, if we &s;hould really dete&s;t &s;uch a mea&s;ure again&s;t our&s;elves, the law of laws forbids us to claim the like power over any of our fellow &s;ubjects, without their free con|&s;ent. "Non facias alteri quod tibi non vis fieri." This is laid down as one of the mo&s;t common precepts of the law of rea&s;on, (Doct. and Stud. c. 2, p. 7.) and &s;uch is the immutability of the law of rea&s;on, that again&s;t it there can be no pre&s;cription, &s;tatute, or cu&s;tom; and if any are made contrary thereto, they are not to be e&s;teemed &s;tatutes or cu&s;toms, but corruptelae, i. e. corruptions or depravities.&mdash;<Q>Non &s;unt &s;tatuta five con&s;uetu|dines, &s;ed corruptelae.</Q><BIBL> Doct. and Stud. c. 2, p. 5. </BIBL>To the &s;ame effect is that command of Chri&s;t him&s;elf (recorded in Matt. vii. 12.) which our Lord declared to be <Q>the Law and the Prophets;</Q> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets;</Q> &s;o that it may ju&s;tly be entituled, the Law of Laws; and a &s;tatute, therefore, which is contrary thereto, is doubly unlawful.</P>
<P>The &s;eparate intere&s;ts of the two kingdoms are &s;ufficiently re&s;trained, with re&s;pect to each other, by our excellent con&s;ti|tution of &s;tate, which requires the a&s;&s;ent of the people (that is of tho&s;e which are concerned re&s;pectively) to render any law valid and binding upon either nation; which the foregoing ar|guments demon&s;trate; and I hope the ingenious and &s;en&s;ible author of the <HI>Argument in Defence of the Colonies</HI> (lately publi&s;hed) will acknowledge, that he has allowed too much, when he admits, in page 114, that <Q>the whole kingdom of Ireland is bound by the acts of the &s;upreme legi&s;lature,</Q> &amp;c. which doctrine leads him afterwards to make a di&s;tinction between Taxation and Legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>And again, the two kingdoms are &s;o firmly united by the bands of allegiance, to one head (or monarchy) of limited power, that their intere&s;ts in all material external exigencies are thereby rendered mutual, as well as their internal intere&s;t, in the maintenance of natural and con&s;titutional liberty, in each kingdom re&s;pectively, becau&s;e one of them cannot be deprived of this (as they are governed by the &s;ame head) without ha&s;t|ening the de&s;truction of the other. And this intimate con|nexion of mutual intere&s;t in the con&s;titution of &s;tate, and in the reciprocal enjoyment of the &s;ame rea&s;onable common law, whereby each kingdom enjoys an equality of privilege and natural freedom, renders the union of the two kingdoms more ju&s;t and equitable, and, con&s;equently, more &s;afe and durable than it could po&s;&s;ibly have been made by any other means; and the inhabitants of both i&s;lands (though &s;prung from a variety of jarring, jealous, and fierce nations) have, by the&s;e means, acquired a certain mutual con&s;ideration for each other, as fellow &s;ubjects, which could never have been produced by mere alliances, guarantees, or defen&s;ive leagues; nor, perhaps, by any other mode of government whatever, than that by which divine providence has effected it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution; this has firmly united the &s;trength of the two i&s;lands; whereby reciprocal &s;uccour, in time of need, is in&s;ured to both.</P></NOTE> But as it does not appear
