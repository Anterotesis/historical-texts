<P>WE implore thee, O KING of kings, to crown with the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven and earth our mo&s;t gracious &s;o|vereign Lord GEORGE III by Thy Grace King of Great Britain and Ireland and of all the dominions thereunto belonging, defender of the Faith, and throughout all his realms, &s;upreme in all cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil.

Pour down upon them the continual dew of thy ble&s;&s;ing, that they may be holy and exem|plary in their lives, and faithful &s;tewards of Thy my&s;teries.</P>
<P>BLESS the Nobility and Magi&s;tracy: endue them with grace and wi&s;dom, that they may all in their &s;everal cha|racters, maintain religion and virtue.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ACTS II. 42.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>They continued &s;tedfa&s;tly in the</HI> APOSTLES DOCTRINE <HI>and</HI> FELLOWSHIP, <HI>and in</HI> BREAKING OF BREAD, <HI>and in</HI> PRAYERS.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO under&s;tand the nature and genius of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, it is nece&s;&s;ary to examine it in it's fir&s;t principles and review it's original con&s;titution: when in the &s;im|plicity of truth it had &s;o divine an influence on the manners and hearts of it's profe&s;&s;ors. In an enquiry of this kind, we may find great a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the whole book (and particularly from the above-cited pa&s;&s;age) of the acts of the holy apo&s;tles: in which are recorded the fir&s;t conver&s;ions to the faith, the arguments u&s;ed by in&s;pired teachers, the doctrines and conduct which they held e&s;&s;ential to the votaries of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE manners of chri&s;tians, the conditions of their commu|nion, and the con&s;tituent principles of the fir&s;t church-&s;ociety, are expre&s;&s;ed in the text, from the practice of the primitive be|lievers, with &s;o much exactne&s;s; that an enquiry into them will furni&s;h a mo&s;t perfect model for the forming a chri&s;tian &s;ociety on the maxims of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t e&s;&s;ential in the in&s;titution of this amiable fraternity is &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in the DOCTRINE of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="008789_0010_102FE2554C0141E8">
THE next is CHURCH-COMMUNION.</P>
<P>THE third is the commemoration of their common Lord in the BREAKING OF BREAD or celebrating the holy euchari&s;t.</P>
<P>THE fourth and la&s;t is PRAYER.</P>
<P>BENEVOLENCE and purity of manners was the natural re&s;ult of &s;uch an in&s;titution: and the church of JERUSALEM, the mo&s;t an|cient and mother of all, was equally di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;implicity and innocence, virtue and fraternal love; as by truth of doctrine, unity of its members, frequency of euchari&s;t, and fervour of devotion.</P>
<P>APOSTOLIC doctrine, union, &s;acraments and prayer are there|fore, by the authority of this re&s;pectable precedent, requi&s;ite to the right con&s;titution of a chri&s;tian church; and are tho&s;e e&s;&s;en|tials &s;o much &s;ought after, in which all who agree compo&s;e ONE SOCIETY, notwith&s;tanding &s;mall differences of ritual, di&s;cipline or polity. The&s;e e&s;&s;entials con&s;titute that catholic church,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 6, <HI>from I&s;ai.</HI> xxviii. 16. <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 20.</NOTE><HI>which is built on the foundation of the prophets and apo&s;tles, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the head corner-&s;tone.

be <HI>burnt,</HI> to the lo&s;s or hazard of the unfaithful or un&s;kilful build|er: we cannot more u&s;efully adapt our reflections to the pre&s;ent &s;olemnity, than by attentively con&s;idering the con&s;tituent princi|ples on which the earlie&s;t Chri&s;tian church was modelled by the whole college of apo&s;tles under the illumination of the HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t thing ob&s;ervable in this tran&s;action is the forcible addre&s;s of the apo&s;tles to the con&s;ciences of their Jewi&s;h audience; convincing them of their guilt in crucifying and rejecting the LORD of life; in&s;i&s;ting on the proofs of his re&s;urrection, both from ancient oracles and their own te&s;timony; and a&s;&s;erting his divine legation from the &s;ignal miracles by which GOD had ap|proved him. Pierced to the heart by this pathetic remon&s;trance, they fervently &s;olicit the Apo&s;tles to teach them <HI>what they &s;hall do</HI> to e&s;cape the puni&s;hment of their impiety. St. Peter's reply is remarkable, as it includes the e&s;&s;entials of the chri&s;tian religion, or of that DOCTRINE mentioned in the text as the fir&s;t requi&s;ite in the con&s;titution of a true church. REPENT <HI>and be</HI> BAPTIZED <HI>in the name of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Repentance and faith (the latter implied in being baptized in the name of Chri&s;t) appear to be the &s;ub&s;tance of the apo&s;tles doctrine, from this and many other places of their<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">xx. 21. <HI>Hebr.</HI> vi. 1.</NOTE> acts and writings.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mark</HI> i. 15.</NOTE><HI>Re|pent ye, and believe</HI> the go&s;pel, was the original preaching of CHRIST him&s;elf; and the u&s;ual topics of his apo&s;tles are a&s;&s;ertions and te&s;timonies of CHRIST's re&s;urrection, and animated exhor|tations to faith and repentance.</P>
<P>HOW many elaborate controver&s;ies are cut &s;hort, if not deci|ded! what learned contentions are appea&s;ed! what &s;trifes and
<PB N="4" REF="008789_0012_102FE25A25F358E8">
animo&s;ities &s;ub&s;ide! by recurring to the&s;e &s;imple terms of the go&s;|pel-covenant: which wholly fix the mind on piety and duty,&mdash;<HI>that</HI> piety and <HI>that</HI> duty, which are &s;o often lo&s;t &s;ight of, in the mi&s;ts of di&s;putation. Repentance, (by which I under&s;tand <HI>uni|ver&s;al and &s;incere obedience,</HI> properly enough termed repentance when propo&s;ed to new converts, who had been heretofore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 18.</NOTE> <HI>alie|nated from the life of God)</HI> this repentance, and Faith, include un|doubtedly the whole of chri&s;tian ethics and doctrines. As he who would <HI>divide</HI> them, gives an imperfect and mutilated &s;cheme of religion; &s;o the <HI>additions</HI> of unintelligible controver&s;ies and refinements, as articles of faith and matters of duty, are that very <HI>wood, hay, &s;tubble,</HI> which will not abide the fiery te&s;t of a divine examination.</P>
<P>YET the &s;uperadding human in&s;titutes to the&s;e primary truths and principles of chri&s;tianity, appeared very early in the attempts of blending the ritual of <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> with the doctrines of faith and repentance: and afterwards more flagrantly in the portentous <HI>here&s;ies</HI> of the fir&s;t ages. The&s;e were &s;ucceeded by the politic &s;u|per&s;titions of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> church: and the barbarous &s;ophi&s;try of explaining religion by the philo&s;ophy and logic of the Greeks, pro|duced the &s;ubtleties of the <HI>&s;chola&s;tic</HI> metaphy&s;ics; which from a &s;imple creed and plain rule of life, have tortured chri&s;tianity into a continued aenigma. Formed in the&s;e &s;chools, though their barbari&s;m was poli&s;hed by the &s;tudies of humanity; the great re|&s;torers of religion in the XVIth century, &s;till continued to violate it's &s;implicity, by inventing new doctrines, and embara&s;&s;ing reve|lation with acce&s;&s;ory difficulties.</P>
<P>TO <HI>find re&s;t to our &s;ouls,</HI> amid&s;t the&s;e perplexities of human in|terpolations; we mu&s;t recur to the original terms of the go&s;pel-covenant.
<PB N="5" REF="008789_0013_102FE25C629EDAA0">
By a diligent &s;earch of the &s;criptures, and by employ|ing all the aids of learning that may be&s;t illu&s;trate them; by this &s;tudy, accompanied with a love of truth and a moral practice, we &s;hall be&s;t di&s;cern what doctrines are &s;pecifically included in the notion of faith: what duties are implied and comprehended under that of repentance. The fir&s;t, con&s;idered &s;y&s;tematically, implies a firm, &s;incere, and <HI>practical</HI> BELIEF (if I may &s;o expre&s;s a faith that operates by virtuous practice) including all the doc|trines of the MEDIATORIAL oeconomy, or &s;cheme of REDEMP|TION: which, being matter of pure revelation, and depending &s;olely on divine authority, is to be collected <HI>only</HI> from the in&s;pired &s;criptures. To give an exact analy&s;is of the chri&s;tian faith would be a work of much indu&s;try. At pre&s;ent, it may be &s;ufficient to remark, that the e&s;&s;entials of which it con&s;i&s;ts are &s;ummed up with &s;ufficient accuracy, in that be&s;t medium of unity and peace, the CREED a&s;cribed to the apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>THIS very ancient &s;ymbol may be con&s;idered as the palladium of chri&s;tianity&mdash;and as it mu&s;t be guarded by all parties with mo&s;t religious care, and pre&s;erved inviolable from the &s;acrilegious hands of here&s;y and infidelity;&mdash;&s;o, tho&s;e who are &s;tudious of what is mo&s;t u&s;eful and important in religion, will not find it advi&s;eable to extend their creed beyond the limits pre&s;cribed by &s;imple antiquity, by in&s;erting into it the many problematical &s;peculations, which a curious mind may form on &s;cattered hints of the divine volumes.</P>
<P>THE particular duties, comprehended in that REPENTANCE which comprizes all our moral obligations, may be illu&s;trated by the chri&s;tian ethics, by a careful &s;crutiny and ob&s;ervation of the human heart, and even by the rational deductions of ancient
<PB N="6" REF="008789_0014_102FE25EA2D607A0">
philo&s;ophy. Revelation does not give a <HI>regular</HI> &s;y&s;tem of ethics; in this part, &s;he appeals to Rea&s;on and Nature, which however, by occa&s;ional precepts, &s;he reforms and completes, &s;weetens, adorns, and elevates. Philo&s;ophy, though erroneous as to the principles and means and motives of duty, yet by calling in the aid of eloquence, de&s;cribes and inforces particular moral truths and virtues in a manner &s;o touching, &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive, &s;o rea&s;onable; as much confirms that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DR.

<P>THIS ob&s;ervation is not incon&s;i&s;tent with a full acknowledgment of the <HI>blemi&s;hes</HI> and <HI>defects</HI> of natural religion and ethics: of which the be&s;t philo&s;ophers have left &s;ome<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">CICERO, in a fine panegyric on LUCULLUS, reckons <HI>Revenge</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI> among that great man's <HI>Virtues.</HI> Admodum adole&s;cens, cum fratre, pari <HI>pietate</HI> et indu&s;tri&acirc; praedito, paternas <HI>inimicitias</HI> magn&acirc; cum glori&agrave; e&s;t <HI>per&s;ecutus.

AS the re&s;ult of what hath been advanced on the &s;ubject of a|po&s;tolic doctrine, we may deduce the principles on which the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel may mo&s;t u&s;efully conduct them&s;elves in teaching it. The province of man is, not an amu&s;ing theory, but life and action: and the mo&s;t exalted &s;peculations can be on|ly of u&s;e as they terminate in practice, and produce the effects of righteou&s;ne&s;s and piety. Aiming at &s;o noble a purpo&s;e as (in his own department) THE RESTORING OF PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN|ITY, a mini&s;ter will endeavour to <HI>declare the whole coun&s;el of God,</HI> as revealed in holy &s;cripture: and will employ his utmo&s;t diligence and capacity, in clearly explaining the whole &s;y&s;tem of redempti|on; from thence deducing the particular duties of morality: which &s;hould be accurately defined and &s;tated, and urged on the con&s;cience by arguments and per&s;ua&s;ives, for the mo&s;t part, pure|ly chri&s;tian, drawn from the precepts, example and authority of our LORD and SAVIOUR, and inforced by their true and adequate &s;anctions, the rewards and puni&s;hments he hath &s;et before us.

AS PROTESTANT churches claim neither in&s;piration nor in|fallibility, they mu&s;t all be obnoxious to error; this &s;hould natu|rally lead to a reciprocal indulgence.

<PB N="14" REF="008789_0022_102FE27210D7EF78">
point &s;o generally agreed, that it hardly requires any proof. The mo&s;t ancient chri&s;tians generally concluded their charitable re|pa&s;ts and &s;acred a&s;&s;emblies, with the &s;olemnity of the communion. In imitation of &s;o venerable examples, this &s;acrament is and ought to be held e&s;&s;ential to the form and con&s;truction of all chri&s;tian churches; and that, for the&s;e following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="1">1. AS <HI>commemorative</HI> of the &s;acred Head and Founder of our religion. 2. As a <HI>faederal</HI> rite, confirming the covenant between CHRIST and his church. 3. As a mark of <HI>union</HI> between CHRIST and his members, of the <HI>communion</HI> or charity of the members one with another.</P>
<P>THE breaking of bread, and the pouring of wine, as a memo|rial of the body and blood of JESUS CHRIST broken and &s;hed for us upon the cro&s;s, is an expre&s;&s;ive rite which derives its origin from very ancient religious in&s;titutions. GOD, in both his di&s;|pen&s;ations, hath conde&s;cended to the infirmities of his creatures, in conveying religious ideas, and pre&s;erving the memory of them, by the intervention of external &s;igns. The a&s;&s;ent of faith, the deductions of rea&s;on, and the powers of the imagination are in our pre&s;ent &s;tate inferior to in their energy, and quickened in their operations by &s;trong and lively impre&s;&s;ions on the &s;en&s;es. This method was employed mo&s;t amply in the Jewi&s;h ritual, which is every where a material language, a &s;peaking emblem: in particular the rite of the pa&s;&s;over (between which and the chri&s;tian euchari&s;t there is di&s;cernable an exact analogy) mo&s;t &s;ig|nificantly repre&s;ented the deliverance of the I&s;raelites from the Egyptian tyranny, and typified our redemption by JESUS CHRIST. In this la&s;t revelation (as being de&s;igned for univer&s;al influence, and &s;o not adapted only to the genius of oriental manners) ex|ternal

emblems and &s;ignificant rites are more &s;paringly a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">hibited: and the only po&s;itive in&s;titutions of chri&s;tianity are its two augu&s;t and expre&s;&s;ive &s;acraments. The ablution of bapti&s;m, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;tipulation <HI>of a good con&s;cience towards God,</HI> is an initiation of all into this holy faith: the euchari&s;t &s;o perfectly adumbrates the pa&s;&s;ion of JESUS CHRIST, and by uninterrupted u&s;age has &s;o pre|&s;erved the authentic memory of that event, the very ba&s;is of His religion; that for the noble&s;t purpo&s;es our LORD, &s;o near his death, injoined his apo&s;tles, and in them the church, to 'do this in <HI>remembrance</HI> of Him.'</P>
<P>IN a <HI>federal</HI> re&s;pect, this commemoration ratifies the faith and obedience of His &s;ubjects. Fea&s;ting on &s;acrifices was an ancient u&s;age in confirmation of alliances and compacts: and in this me|morial of the &s;acrifice of CHRIST, GOD and man &s;everally ratify that &s;olemn covenant, of which JESUS CHRIST undertook the mediation: the terms of this compact being on the part of GOD pardon and acceptance, in con&s;ideration of the atonement made on the cro&s;s: on the part of man, repentance and univer&s;al obe|dience. This &s;acred and &s;olemn confirmation of the bapti&s;mal covenant, mu&s;t in true believers be very in&s;trumental to the &s;ub|duing their &s;ins, advancing their &s;anctification, and confirming their allegiance to their LORD and Head. But I am obliged on this occa&s;ion rather to glance at this illu&s;trious argument, than to give it an accurate in&s;pection: and I ha&s;ten to a cur&s;ory view of the third circum&s;tance, wherein the euchari&s;t mu&s;t be con&s;i|&s;idered as e&s;&s;ential to the completene&s;s of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip: namely,</P>
<P>AS a mark of <HI>union</HI> between CHRIST and His members, and of the communion and charity of the members one with another.
<PB N="16" REF="008789_0024_102FE277034EC958">
This idea is accurately expre&s;&s;ed in the devotions of our Liturgy, which teaches us, that by 'the &s;piritual food of the mo&s;t precious body and blood of our Saviour JESUS CHRIST, we are a&s;&s;ured, that we are <HI>very members incorporate in his my&s;tical body,</HI> which is the ble&s;|&s;ed company of all faithful people.' And in the &s;ame prayer, we implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the divine grace, 'that we may <HI>continue in that holy fellow&s;hip,</HI> and do all &s;uch good works as GOD hath prepared for us to walk in.' This union and communion is clearly a&s;&s;erted by St. Paul.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 16. 17.</NOTE><HI>The cup of ble&s;&s;ing which we ble&s;s, is it not the communion of the blood of Chri&s;t; the bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chri&s;t? For we, being many, are one bread and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE it appears, that the charity we exerci&s;e in the &s;acrament, is not only that &s;incere and hearty forgivene&s;s of all injuries and offences, which is the heroi&s;m of a chri&s;tian, triumphing over the evil di&s;po&s;itions of nature; but this commemoration of divine love, is it&s;elf a &s;ublime act of love to GOD and benevolence to man. The former will intere&s;t the heart and affections in ex|pre&s;&s;ing our obedience to his holy and rea&s;onable laws of virtue: the latter, con&s;i&s;ting in a &s;trong inclination to promote human happine&s;s, leads us to con&s;ider all mankind, and e&s;pecially all chri&s;tians as one body. This was the charity which &s;o eminently characterized the church of JERUSALEM; wherein <HI>all that believed were together, and had all things common: parting their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions and goods to all, as every one had need; and the multi|tude of them that believed were of one heart and of one &s;oul.</HI> Such were the graces of that original church; at its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment &s;mall in extent, few in number; but <HI>perfect and complete in

Hence we may collect how indi&s;pen&s;able in the life of a chri&s;tian is the duty of prayer, whe|ther <HI>public,</HI> private, or dome&s;tic. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is principally intended by the writer of the Acts in this place. From the &s;a|cred hi&s;torian,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 46. iii. 1.

moderation, and an expre&s;s authentic te&s;timony of the lawfulne&s;s, the u&s;e, and authority of a PUBLIC LITURGY.</P>
<P>I SHALL not enter into a minute enquiry of ancient offices; whether e&s;&s;ential to the church, whether any were compo&s;ed by the apo&s;tles or their immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for the general u&s;e of the faithful. It is probable, that the bi&s;hops and pa&s;tors of par|ticular churches compo&s;ed their re&s;pective forms, adapted to their &s;tate and times, and occa&s;ionally altered or varied, by their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors. But the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of a liturgy, or of offering our public prayers in precompo&s;ed words. I do not choo&s;e to contend for: its <HI>expediency</HI> will perhaps appear from the following ob&s;ervations, which are &s;trictly applicable to that of our own church.</P>
<P N="1">1. A PRECOMPOSED FORM a&s;&s;i&s;ts and regulates devotion, as it &s;upplies the mind with apt expre&s;&s;ions and clear ideas, which every where ought to accompany that great duty: it being as requi&s;ite to pray<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv. 15.</NOTE> with a right <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> as with a fervent <HI>&s;pirit.</HI> It not only more &s;trongly and ju&s;tly affects the heart and imagination, but compo&s;es the mind to a train of devout think|ing, by a&s;cending methodically through the various parts of prayer,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 1.</NOTE><HI>&s;upplications, petitions, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. IT prevents impropriety and incon&s;i&s;tence; which, highly unbecoming any part of &s;o rea&s;onable a &s;ervice as religion, is mo&s;t incongruous in our addre&s;s to the Maje&s;ty of heaven. When men approach the throne of an earthly monarch, they are cau|tious and exact in arranging their ideas, &s;electing their words, and embelli&s;hing their addre&s;s with a dignity of &s;tyle becoming that of the prince. In the ca&s;e of prayer as well as &s;acrifice, the prophet's

criterion is applicable: <HI>'Offer it now unto thy governor&mdash;will he be plea&s;ed with thee, or accept thy per&s;on? &s;hould I accept this of your hands? for I am a great King, &s;aith the</HI> LORD <HI>of ho&s;ts.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mal.</HI> i. 8, 13, 14.</NOTE> There|fore, whether in the pious effu&s;ions of unpremeditated devotion, or in the more elaborate exactne&s;s of compo&s;ition; whatever is mo&s;t accurate in rea&s;on, mo&s;t augu&s;t in imagination, mo&s;t &s;ublime in eloquence, &s;hould be humbly offered in adoration to the Giver of the&s;e and of all good gifts.</P>
<P N="3">3. A PRINCIPAL u&s;e of a judicious form of common Prayer, is to include in our mo&s;t &s;olemn devotions the e&s;&s;entials of our <HI>duty</HI> and <HI>faith:</HI> which is the mo&s;t effectual method of impre&s;&s;ing them, both on the under&s;tanding and con&s;cience, and of &s;ecuring the &s;incerity of our profe&s;&s;ion. To this &s;tability of our public forms we may perhaps be indebted for that remarkable <HI>freedom from</HI> FALSE RELIGION, which hath ever di&s;tingui&s;hed the reformed church of ENGLAND: the purity of her faith and morals having never been generally &s;ullied by any tincture of &s;uper&s;tition, enthu|&s;ia&s;m, here&s;y, or licentiou&s;ne&s;s. The doctrines and duties of the go&s;pel are &s;o interwoven by mo&s;t &s;ignificant definitions in the pub|lic Liturgy; that the mo&s;t illiterate, who are capable of attention and piety, may collect from it the principles of 'our common &s;alvation.' Its u&s;e is no le&s;s important as a guard and pre&s;ervative again&s;t heretical opinions. Mo&s;t of the depraved doctrines, that have corrupted and deformed religion, are &s;o explicitly condemned in our public offices; that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for a di&s;ciple of <HI>Arius,</HI> of <HI>Pelagius,</HI> or any other haere&s;iarch, to &s;helter him&s;elf under the communion of that church, which &s;o openly declares again&s;t their dangerous errors. That &s;uch a Liturgy, (though compo&s;ed on ancient models, and in which the wi&s;dom of CRANMER, the elo|quence of RIDLEY, the piety of martyrs and confe&s;&s;ors, and the
<PB N="21" REF="008789_0029_102FE282893358C0">
temperate critici&s;m of its &s;ub&s;equent reviewers, combined to pro|duce a mo&s;t accurate form of devotion) that it &s;hould &s;till be &s;ub|ject to &s;ome exceptions, is a nece&s;&s;ary imperfection of even the happie&s;t efforts of human rea&s;on and indu&s;try; not excepting the be&s;t tran&s;lations of Holy Scripture, and our own in particular; which is thought by the able&s;t judges to be capable of much im|provement, by the collation of MSS and ver&s;ions, and other aids of &s;acred literature: a work, which would give a new lu&s;tre to religion, and which, it is hoped, will do honour to the learning and piety of the pre&s;ent age. But to return to our liturgy; if notwith&s;tanding &s;maller blemi&s;hes, the purpo&s;es of devotion are effectually &s;erved by it; if it maintains order, de|cency, and propriety in our admini&s;tration; if it excludes here&s;y from our doctrines; if it pre&s;erves inviolate the apo&s;tolic faith and &s;acraments; let the&s;e important u&s;es vindicate it to others, recommend and indear it to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>AS no Prote&s;tant can a&s;&s;ert the perfection or infallibility of the vi&s;ible church; &s;o we need not &s;cruple to acknowledge, that in the be&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titutions there are defects and errors, which as a private man cannot amend, &s;o a good &s;ubject and hum|ble chri&s;tian will not aggravate or mi&s;repre&s;ent; but will think it his duty to &s;ubmit to une&s;&s;ential imperfections, for the &s;ake of peace, order, and obedience. After &s;o large a conce&s;&s;ion, we may do &s;o much ju&s;tice to the con&s;titution of the church of ENGLAND, as to remark that it is eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed in tho&s;e IV great apo&s;tolic requi&s;ites, which we have de&s;cribed as the notes or marks of a true church, and as e&s;&s;ential to a chri&s;tian &s;ociety. For the purity of her <HI>doctrine,</HI> we may appeal to the united &s;uffrage of all the prote&s;tant churches: its terms of <HI>communion</HI> are evangelical faith and repentance: its government and di&s;cipline are founded on the u&s;ages of the mo&s;t remote and pure antiquity: the <HI>eucha|ri&s;t</HI>

<P>WITH hearts enlarged by devotion and charity, let us, my friends, approve our&s;elves not unmindful of the divine goodne&s;s, which hath made us members of &s;o pure a church, and hath given us an ea&s;y acce&s;s to all the ordinances of religion.

<P>WHILE this province flouri&s;hes under a GOVERNOUR, who has drawn his politics from the &s;chools of philo&s;ophy, and the free ge|nius of the engli&s;h con&s;titution; in an age of learning, humanity and moderation; we have every circum&s;tance concurring to pa|tronize and protect a church, which, we hope, is con&s;tituted on a pure and apo&s;tolic model.

<P>NOT the le&s;t of tho&s;e in&s;truments, by which JESUS CHRIST will extend his &s;piritual empire on earth, and render his religion univer&s;al; is that illu&s;trious SOCIETY FOR THE PROPAGATION OF HIS GOSPEL, the &s;ucce&s;s of who&s;e pious de&s;igns is a &s;ignal di&s;tinction of the XVIIIth-Century; and in &s;ome degree emulates the purity and extent, with which the chri&s;tian faith was diffu&s;ed in the fir&s;t ages of the church.

The attempt indeed of teaching &s;avages a divine philo&s;ophy, before they have acquired any tincture of humanity, is judged by the able&s;t rea&s;oners, and found by experience prema|ture and ineffectual. As chri&s;tianity addre&s;&s;es its doctrines to the heart, and its evidence to the rea&s;on of mankind: armed with no force but that of truth, it offers it&s;elf in the way of per&s;ua&s;ion; which &s;uppo&s;es its converts capable of under&s;tanding its doctrines and precepts, and the proofs of their authority. It argues great ignorance of the human mind, to &s;uppo&s;e that uncivilized bar|barians can admit the go&s;pel with any &s;tability or continuance. The chri&s;tian faith hath always met with the readie&s;t and mo&s;t durable reception among the mo&s;t learned and civil nations. While EUROPE, which is &s;o poli&s;hed by &s;cience and arts, hath generally &s;ubmitted to the empire of JESUS CHRIST; other parts of the world are either in total darkne&s;s and ignorance, or but partially illuminated; and that, in very near proportion to the &s;tate of civil &s;ociety. The con&s;equence is obvious from &s;o clear a fact, which points out the only method of diffu&s;ing the faith among the &s;avages of our own continent.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;dom of <HI>policy</HI> mu&s;t prepare the way for the reception of religion.
