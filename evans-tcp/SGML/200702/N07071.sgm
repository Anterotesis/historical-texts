<P>IT is natural for per&s;ons, when they take a di&s;cour&s;e into their hands, on the occa&s;ion of the following, to enquire after the cau&s;e or rea&s;on that has given ri&s;e to it. To be very particular and minute in the detail would be too tedious. The following may &s;erve to &s;atisfy the candid and impartial inquirer.</P>
<P>The author's &s;ituation has been peculiarly difficult, even from his fir&s;t acquaintance with the place, e&s;pecially by rea&s;on of the long difficulties and divi&s;ions that have there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, which were ri&s;en to a great height in the days of his honoured prede|ce&s;&s;or, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. JOSEPH COIT.</NOTE> and were the unhappy means of bringing his gray hairs with &s;orrow to the grave. The&s;e difficulties and divi&s;ions that have and &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, were occa&s;ioned by that &s;pirit of di&s;cord, &s;own by the arch-enemy in many of our pari&s;hes; whence ma|ny have undertaken, with freedom, to cen&s;ure the con&s;titution of the government, and the more common method of mini&s;terial &s;upport; exclaiming with vehemence again&s;t the churches, as being Antichri&s;t and Babylon; the rulers as ruling for Baol, and their teachers as teaching for lucre, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>This &s;pirit of rancour, bitterne&s;s, and divi&s;ion having made a mo&s;t prodigious progre&s;s, many minds were prejudiced, and the&s;e prejudices indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, that there were but few who&s;e minds were not &s;oured by this leaven of wicked|ne&s;s, and became cold in their affections to the mini&s;try. The&s;e things rendered the author's &s;upport extremely difficult, there being no way to attain it but by mere dint of law; a method the author try'd many years, with reluctance. There being no pro&s;pect of times being better, and the &s;ociety &s;ignifying their de&s;ire, or willingne&s;s, of their pa&s;tor's being di&s;mi&s;s'd from his pa&s;toral relation, the motion was made to the church, who at fir&s;t manife&s;ted their unwillingne&s;s to concur, being united and in full charity with their pa&s;tor; but con&s;idering, upon a review, that the mini&s;terial &s;upport was from the &s;o|ciety in conjunction with the church, &mdash; that they could not proceed but in con&s;ort, &mdash; they pa&s;s'd a vote (tho' with very

great reluctance, being in full charity, as it is expre&s;s'd in their vote) for the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of their reverend pa&s;tor, and im|powered him, in their names, to &s;end to an eccle&s;ia&s;tical coun|cil for that purpo&s;e; which council, in their re&s;ult, expre&s;s them&s;elves as follows.</P>
<P>"Con&s;idering the many and great difficulties which have long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in this place, and the deep-rooted (th&ocirc;, as we believe ill-grounded) prejudices which are in the minds of &s;o many again&s;t their pre&s;ent pa&s;tor, and the little pro&s;pect of his being longer u&s;eful in this place when &s;o great a majority appear de&s;ireous of his removal, (as al&s;o Mr. Rowland's earne&s;t de&s;ire to be removed) think it be&s;t that his pa&s;toral relation to this people be di&s;&s;olved; and therefore do (th&ocirc; with reluctance) di&s;&s;olve the pa&s;toral relation between the rev. Mr. Rowland and the fir&s;t &s;ociety and the church in Plainfield. As there have been no charges, of any kind, exhibited again&s;t Mr. Rowland, &s;o we freely declare that we know nothing, of any kind, re|&s;pecting him, that can be any di&s;qualification for the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try; and do very cordially&punc; recommend him to any part of the chri&s;tian church where providence may open a door to his future u&s;efulne&s;s."</P>

<P>And now behold, I know that ye all among whom I have gone, preaching the kingdom of God, &s;hall &s;ee my face no more.</P>
<P>Therefore I take you to record, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</P>
<P>For I have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the coun&s;el of God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE words now read, are a part of St. Paul's farewel-&s;ermon, delivered to the elders of the church of Ephe&s;us, one of the noted churches, in the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, of which we have an account in the book of the revelation of St. John. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2. beg.&mdash;</NOTE> &s;ome interpreters &s;uppo&s;e the words, tho' immediately directed to the elders of the church, were yet de&s;igned to include the whole church. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Calvin in Loc.</NOTE> However it is evident the apo&s;tle &s;pent con&s;iderable time at Ephe&s;us, that his conduct and behaviour was well known both to mi|ni&s;ters and people, preaching the go&s;pel to them, and la|bouring for their &s;alvation, not only in their publick &s;yna|gogues, but al&s;o in their private hou&s;es, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, as ver. 20. This holy apo&s;tle was indefatigable in his labours, and never did, thro' &s;loth negligence, or weak ti|midity, &s;acrifice a good con&s;cience. He faced dangers and defied cen&s;ure, was ready not only to be bound, but al&s;o to die, for the name and honour of Chri&s;t; and when bonds and afflictions awaited him, he made no account of them, not e&s;teeming his very life precious to him&s;elf on &s;uch an occa|&s;ion, that he might faithfully and joyfully fini&s;h his cour&s;e as a chri&s;tian, and an apo&s;tle, and fulfil the mini&s;try which he had recieved of the Lord Je&s;us, even to te&s;tify the truth, and urge the importance of the glorious go&s;pel of the free and abundant grace of God; a di&s;pen&s;ation infinitely

glorious, in which the abundant grace of God &s;hines with a lu&s;tre not to be equaled, to which we are all indebted, infinitely indebted, mini&s;ters and people, far beyond the re|turns we can ever make. The apo&s;tle gloried in the doc|trines of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, as they contained the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious di&s;play of divine grace, and were the power of God to the &s;alvation of all that believe, to the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the Greek <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. i, 16.&mdash;</NOTE>. The apo&s;tle was &s;o far from being a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t that he gloried in it; and the impor|tant truths of it he endeavoured to pre&s;s upon the minds of tho&s;e to whom he preached; and at Ephe&s;us he kept back nothing that was profitable unto them <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. 20, 21. continued.&mdash;</NOTE>; te&s;tifying, both to Jews and Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith to|wards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And now being about to take his leave of them, he addre&s;&s;es them as in the words of my text: And now behold I know that ye all, my dear brethren, among whom I have gone, &s;hall &s;ee my face no more. The words are a Hebrai&s;m, for, ye &s;hall not all &s;ee my face any more<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pool's Synop in loc.</NOTE>. Some &s;uppo&s;e that the apo&s;tle had it intimated par|ticularly to him that he &s;hould no more come to Ephe&s;us, and therefore never have an opportunity of &s;eeing them to whom he was now addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in the mo&s;t tender and affectionate manner; <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Doddridge in Loc. and his note on v. 27.</NOTE> therefore he &s;ent for them that he might take his &s;olemn farewel of them, and to te&s;tify to them all, that if any of them peri&s;h, yet he &s;hould be clear from the blood of all men. I te&s;tify to you, and God is my witne&s;s that I have laboured for your &s;alvation, and the &s;alvation of all that heard me, and have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the coun&s;el of God. He &s;uppre&s;s'd nothing that was advantageous or that would promote their edification; he did not avoid nor &s;hun, from any con|&s;ideration what&s;oever, declaring all the coun&s;el of God; he did not withhold or di&s;gui&s;e any important truth, nor de|cline the open publication of it for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing tho&s;e to whom it ought to be declared: But, on the contrary, he delivered the coun&s;el, or will of God, with the greate&s;t &s;incerity and unre&s;ervedne&s;s; opening and enforcing the im|portant

truths relating to our redemption, by Chri&s;t, and the way to eternal happine&s;s with him, in the mo&s;t plain and faithful manner; not regarding the cen&s;ure and con|tempt he might incur from the enemies of chri&s;tianity; deaf to cen&s;ure, to applau&s;e unelate, re&s;olute in the face of dangers, and inflexible to every motive of ea&s;e and &s;ecuri|ty, he pur&s;ued the arduous work he had undertaken, and, like the &s;aints of old, loved not his life to the death <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii, 11.</NOTE>, that is, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the greate&s;t dangers, and met death in the glorious conflict; but he fell to ri&s;e, triumph and reign.</P>
<P>But in pur&s;uing the de&s;ign in view, I &s;hall only take no|tice of two things in general; where I &s;hall endeavour,</P>
<P N="1">I. To &s;hew you when a mini&s;ter may be &s;aid to &s;hun declaring all the coun&s;el of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. Con&s;ider &s;ome things included and nece&s;&s;arily impli|ed in declaring all the coun&s;el of God.</P>
<P>Then I &s;hall make &s;ome improvement &s;uitable to our cir|cum&s;tances in the pro&s;pect of our parting.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, I am to &s;hew you when a mini&s;ter may be &s;aid to &s;hun declaring all the coun&s;el of God.</P>
<P>He who dare make the mo&s;t &s;acred things &s;erve to gratify his own, or the humours of others, or as a cloke to colour over his pride and avarice, is in the mo&s;t pitiable and unhappy condition. It is a crime too many have been guilty of, trifling with things in their nature &s;acred, and a profanation unpardonable, were it not that infinite mercy had been exerci&s;ed in behalf of the greate&s;t &s;inners, even the chief <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i.15.</NOTE>. Happy had it been for many had the ordinances of Chri&s;t never been pro&s;tituted to the mo&s;t ba&s;e and merce|nary views for promoting &s;ecular intere&s;t, and inordinate cravings of a &s;elfi&s;h mind; and it would &s;till be more hap|py, were there no &s;uch pernicious and de&s;tructive principle prevalent, or &s;o much as to be found in this world; and tho' it is what may not be expected in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, to be perfectly free from &s;uch an infelicity; yet it is the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel of the grace of God to purify and re|fine men, to fit and prepare them for the mo&s;t noble &s;ervi|ces

in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and to conduct them to a better; to free them, while here, from tho&s;e evils, and to deliver them from tho&s;e fal&s;e bia&s;es to which they are &s;o incident; to prompt them to act in the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted manner, with a &s;uitable regard to the honour and glory of God, the wel|fare of their own, and the &s;ouls of others. Men that are in a &s;tate of &s;lavery to their lu&s;ts, can't well avoid being &s;laves to the humors of others; and it is a thou&s;and to one, if &s;uch do not &s;acrifice a good con&s;cience thro' weak timi|dity, and fear of giving offence. &mdash;The apo&s;tle had not &s;o learned Chri&s;t; therefore &s;pake the word with all freedom and boldne&s;s, without fear or affection to any man, whe|ther they would hear or whether they would forbear, con|&s;cious that he was to God a &s;weet &s;avour of Chri&s;t, in them that peri&s;h, and in them that are &s;aved, to the one a &s;avour of life, unto life, but to the other a &s;avour of death unto death. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. ii, 15, 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here I &s;hall mention two or three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. A mini&s;ter may be &s;aid to &s;hun declaring all the coun&s;el of God when he don't deliver the doctrines of Chri&s;t in a plain and intelligible manner, when he endeavours to con|ceal him&s;elf under unintelligible phra&s;es, and an uncertain manner of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, that his hearers are at a lo&s;s to know what the plain de&s;ign of his expre&s;&s;ions import. &mdash; The doctrines of Chri&s;t are of the la&s;t concern to mankind; their well-being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s nearly, yea nece&s;&s;arily de|pends upon their being well under&s;tood; without this kind of knowledge the heart can't be good <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xix, 2.</NOTE>, there can be no en|joyment of the chief good, no well-grounded hope of eter|nal life. &mdash;If the opportunities enjoyed for in&s;truction are doubtful and uncertain what hope of reaping profit and ad|vantage from them? The &s;tile in which a mini&s;ter addre&s;|&s;es his audience, ought not on the one hand to be jejune and flat, &s;o as to render his admini&s;trations contemptible, nor on the other hand, too florid and bomba&s;t, that they can't be recieved by per&s;ons of an ordinary &s;ize: he ought ra|ther to &s;tudy a graceful decent and plain method of com|municating, that his words, fitly &s;poken, may be like ap|ples

of Gold in pictures of &s;ilver <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxv, 11.</NOTE>. The apo&s;tle Paul plainly intimates to us this as his manner of preaching <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii, 1&punc; 4.</NOTE>; And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excel|lency of &s;peech or of wi&s;dom, declaring unto you the te&s;ti|mony of God; my &s;peech and my preaching was not with enticeing words of mens wi&s;dom, but in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit, and of power; not with wi&s;dom of words, le&s;t the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t &s;hould be made of none effect. The apo&s;tle lets the Corinthians know that his aim and manner a|mong them, even from the begining, was not with the pomp of language, no, far very far from affecting &s;uch a method to engage their affections, he kept in view the great de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, which was admirably calculated to &s;tain the pride of human glory; he had no need of affecting the &s;ublimity and &s;ubtilty made u&s;e of among the Greeks of that age; the go&s;pel needed not any ornaments of human invention, nor could the laboured charms of eloquence or philo&s;ophy give lu&s;tre or empha&s;is to it: he therefore endea|voured to exhibit it in as intelligible a method as he could; treating it as coming from God: in &s;uch a manner &s;hould the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t addre&s;s them&s;elves to their people, then might they, with ju&s;ter rea&s;on, hope for the happy &s;uc|ce&s;s of their admini&s;trations, and that their hearers might grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and &s;avi|our Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. iii, 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>The knowledge of things divine is, in its nature, the mo&s;t excellent, and mo&s;t directly tends to the welfare and happine&s;s of &s;uch as are made effectually acquainted with them, that to prevent, and embarra&s;s the truths of God, by a doubtful and unintelligible method of explication is an evil almo&s;t unpardonable.</P>

This the apo&s;tle Paul propo&s;es as the real and genuine character of chri&s;tianity, its natural and proper effect; and it was the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s he had of his own integrity, plain-heartedne&s;s, freedom from deceit and guile that animated him in the di&s;charge of his emba&s;&s;y a|mid&s;t the clamours and reproaches thrown upon him by &s;ons of malice &s;lander and fal&s;hood: Our rejoicing (&s;aith he) is this, the te&s;timony of our con&s;cience that in &s;implicity with godly &s;incerity <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i, 12.</NOTE>, maintaining a &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence and in&s;pection (the &s;ure&s;t guard unto unfeigned in|tegrity) we live in the world.&mdash;This holy apo&s;tle &s;tudied always the mo&s;t artle&s;s method of conduct, at all times and in all places; he abhorred the notion of deceit and guile, as methods below the chri&s;tian and the apo&s;tle <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xii, 16.

<P><PB N="25" REF="009000_0023_10307F8743725EB8">Some are bold and impudent enough to &s;ay, that preaching the go&s;pel is the lea&s;t part of the mini&s;terial office; but &s;uch are wi&s;e above what is written. The apo&s;tle St. Paul, who well under&s;tood the duties of his office, had views of things very different from &s;uch dictators: he e&s;teemed it the principal branch of his office, as an apo&s;tle and mini&s;ter. He &s;aith, Chri&s;t &s;ent me not to baptize, i. e. not &s;o much to baptize, as to preach the go&s;pel <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i, 17.</NOTE>. This he con&s;idered as his principal, his main bu&s;ine&s;s, by which he was to bring per&s;ons to that faith which would intitle them to the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel. By preaching the go&s;pel mens eyes were to be opened, and they turned from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and inheritance among them that are &s;anctified <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi, 17, 18.</NOTE>. This is the grand de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, the important end in view, and the medium for its accompli&s;hment is preaching all the coun&s;el of God. If &s;uch as make the objection, mean only the deli|very of a di&s;cour&s;e, it is ju&s;t: but it mu&s;t be remembered that preaching the go&s;pel nece&s;&s;arily includes every thing requi&s;ite to it, as reading, &s;tudy, meditation, and prayer, and when it is con&s;idered in its nece&s;&s;ary connection, it is, as it will appear in this view, the grand, the mo&s;t important part of the mini&s;terial function. The un&s;criptural and unrea&s;ona|ble notion that too many have of a mini&s;ter's &s;pending a great part, if not all his time in vi&s;its, is at mo&s;t but a di&s;|cretionary bu&s;ine&s;s, except in ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, and the like; it is di&s;cretionary becau&s;e there is no po&s;itive command for it, and there being no po&s;itive command for it, it mu&s;t be left, as it is, to the mini&s;ters own di&s;cretion, and not ano|another's; and performed as his lei&s;ure will admit and prudence dictates. A practice of this bu&s;ine&s;s, in ordinary ca&s;es, would, I pre&s;ume, be more likely to be di&s;&s;ervicea|ble than beneficial. And as it is nor an e&s;&s;ential branch of the mini&s;terial office, and not &s;trictly enjoined in common ca&s;es&punc; &s;o he mu&s;t be determined by the knowledge he has of per&s;ons and their circum&s;tances, and &s;o conducting he is accountable to none. But in preaching the go&s;pel he ought to lay him&s;elf out in the be&s;t manner, and exert him&s;elf
