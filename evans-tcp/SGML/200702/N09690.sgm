<HEAD>I. <HI>Natural Rights of the Coloni&s;ts as</HI> Men.</HEAD>
<P>Among the natural Rights of the Coloni&s;ts are the&s;e: Fir&s;t, a Right to <HI>Life;</HI> &s;econdly, to <HI>Liberty;</HI> thirdly, to <HI>Property;</HI> together with the Right to &s;upport and defend them in the be&s;t Manner they can. The&s;e are evident Bran|ches of, rather than Deductions from the Duty of Self-Pre&s;ervation, commonly called the fir&s;t Law of Nature.</P>
<P>All Men have a Right to remain in a State of Nature as long as they plea&s;e: And in Ca&s;e of intollerable Oppre&s;&s;ion, civil or religious, to leave the Society they belong to, and enter in|to another.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="012332_0006_0F88C8C038AD4AE8">
When Men enter into Society, it is by vo|luntary Con&s;ent; and they have a Right to demand and in&s;i&s;t upon the Performance of &s;uch Conditions and previous Limitations as form an equitable <HI>original Compact.</HI></P>
<P>Every natural Right, not expre&s;ly given up, or from the Nature of a &s;ocial Compact nece&s;|&s;arily ceded, remains.</P>
<P>All po&s;itive and civil Laws, &s;hould conform as far as po&s;&s;ible, to the Law of natural Rea&s;on and Equity.</P>
<P>As neither Rea&s;on requires, nor Religion permits the contrary, every Man living in or out of a State of civil Society, has a Right peace|ably and quietly to wor&s;hip GOD, according to the Dictates of his Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>"<HI>Ju&s;t and true Liberty, equal and impartial Liberty</HI>" in Matters &s;piritual and temporal, is a Thing that all Men are clearly entitled to, by the eternal and immutable Laws of GOD and Nature, as well as by the Law of Nations, and all well grounded municipal Laws, which mu&s;t have their Foundation in the former.</P>
<P>In Regard to Religion, mutual Toleration in the different Profe&s;&s;ions thereof, is what all good and candid Minds in all Ages have ever practiced: and both by Precept and Example
<PB N="4" REF="012332_0007_0F88C8C0EB0F02A0">
inculcated on Mankind: And it is now gene|rally agreed among Chri&s;tians, that this Spirit of Toleration, in the fulle&s;t Extent con&s;i&s;tent, with the Being of Civil Society, "is the chief characteri&s;tical Mark of the true Church."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lock's Letters on Toleration.</NOTE> In|&s;omuch that Mr. Lock has a&s;&s;erted, and proved beyond the Po&s;&s;ibility of Contradiction on any &s;olid Ground, that &s;uch Toleration ought to be extended to all who&s;e Doctrines are not &s;ub|ver&s;ive of Society. The only Sects which he thinks ought to be, and which by all wi&s;e Laws are excluded from &s;uch Toleration, are tho&s;e who teach Doctrines &s;ubver&s;ive of the civil Go|vernment under which they live. The Roman Catholicks or Papi&s;ts are excluded, by Rea&s;on of &s;uch Doctrines as the&s;e, "that Princes ex|communicated may be depo&s;ed, and tho&s;e they call <HI>Hereticks</HI> may be de&s;troyed without Mer|cy; be&s;ides their recognizing the Pope in &s;o ab|&s;olute a Manner, in Subver&s;ion of Government, by introducing as far as po&s;&s;ible into the States, under who&s;e Protection they enjoy Life, Liberty and Property, that Soleci&s;m in Politicks, <HI>Impe|rium in Imperio</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Government within a Government.</NOTE>, leading directly to the wor&s;t Anarchy and Confu&s;ion, civil Di&s;cord, War and Blood&s;hed.</P>

only as is nece&s;&s;ary for the great End of Socie|ty, the be&s;t Good of the Whole.</P>
<P>In the State of Nature, every Man is, under GOD, Judge, and &s;ole Judge, of his own Rights, and of the Injuries done him: By en|tering into Society, he agrees to an <HI>Arbiter</HI> or indifferent Judge between him and his Neigh|bours; but he no more renounces his original Right, than by taking a Cau&s;e out of the ordi|nary Cour&s;e of Law, and leaving the Deci&s;ion to Referces or indifferent Arbitrators. In the la&s;t Ca&s;e he mu&s;t pay the Referces for Time and Trouble; he &s;hould al&s;o be willing to pay his ju&s;t Quota for the Support of Government, the Law and the Con&s;titution; the End of which is to furni&s;h indifferent and impartial Judges in all Ca&s;es that may happen, whether civil, eccle|&s;ia&s;tical, marine or military.</P>
<P>"The <HI>natural</HI> Liberty of Man is to be free from any &s;uperior Power on Earth, and not to be under the Will or legi&s;lative Authority of Man; but only to have the Law of Nature for his Rule."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locke on Government.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the State of Nature, Men may, as the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> did, employ hired Servants for the Defence of their Lives, Liberties and Property; and they &s;hould pay them rea&s;onable Wages.
<PB N="6" REF="012332_0009_0F88C8C3FA5B6C30">
<HI>Government</HI> was in&s;tituted for the Purpo&s;es of common Defence; and tho&s;e who hold the Reins of Government have an equitable natu|ral Right to an honorable Support from the &s;ame Principle "that the Labourer is worthy of his Hire": But then the &s;ame Community which they &s;erve, ought to be the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of their Pay: Governors have no Right to &s;eek and take what they plea&s;e; by this, in&s;tead of being content with the Station a&s;&s;igned them, that of honorable Servants of the Society, they would &s;oon become ab&s;olute <HI>Ma&s;ters, De&s;pots</HI> and <HI>Tyrants.</HI> Hence as a private Man has a Right to &s;ay, what Wages he will give in his private Affairs, &s;o has a Community to deter|mine what <HI>they</HI> will give and grant of their Sub&s;tance, for the Admini&s;tration of publick Affairs. And in both Ca&s;es, more are ready generally to offer their Service at the propo&s;ed and &s;tipulated Price, than are able and willing to perform their Duty.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it is the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity to &s;up|po&s;e it in the Power of one or any Number of Men, at the entering into Society, to renounce their e&s;&s;ential natural Rights, or the Means of pre&s;erving tho&s;e Rights; when the grand End of civil Government from the very Nature of its In&s;titution, is for the Support, Protection and Defence of tho&s;e very Rights: The principal of which as is before ob&s;erved, are Life, Liberty

and by Acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament are de|clared to be entitled, to all the natural, e&s;&s;ential, inherent and in&s;eperable Rights, Liberties and Privileges of Subjects born in Great-Britain, or within the Realm.

That the&s;e Coloni&s;ts are well entitled to all the e&s;&s;ential Rights, Liberties and Privileges of Men and Freemen, born in Britain, is manife&s;t, not only from the Colony Charters in general, but Acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament. The Sta|tute of the 13th of Geo. 2. c. 7. naturalizes even Foreigners after &s;even Years Re&s;idence. The Words of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Charter are the&s;e, "And further our Will and Plea&s;ure is, and we do hereby for Us, our Heirs and Succe&s;|&s;ors, grant, e&s;tabli&s;h and ordain, that all and

<HEAD>A Li&s;t of Infringements and Violations of Rights.</HEAD>
<P>WE cannot help thinking, that an Enu|meration of &s;ome of the mo&s;t open In|fringements of our Rights, will by every candid Per&s;on be judged &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify whatever Mea&s;ures have been already taken, or may be thought proper to be taken, in order to obtain a Redre&s;s of the Grievances under which we labour. Among many others, we humbly con|ceive, that the following will not fail to excite the Attention of all who con&s;ider them&s;elves intere&s;ted in the Happine&s;s and Freedom of Mankind in general, and of this Continent and Province in particular.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The Briti&s;h Parliament have a&s;&s;umed the Powers of Legi&s;lation for the Coloni&s;ts in all Ca&s;es what&s;oever, without obtaining the Con|&s;ent of the Inhabitants, which is ever e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the rightful E&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a Legi&s;lative.</P>

Earnings in his own Hands until he &s;hall, in Per&s;on, or by his Repre&s;entative, think fit to part with the Whole or any Portion of it. This Infringement is the more extraordinary, when we con&s;ider the laudable Care which the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons have taken, to re|&s;erve intirely and ab&s;olutely to them&s;elves the Powers of giving and granting Money. They not only in&s;i&s;t on originating every Money Bill in their own Hou&s;e, but will not even allow the Hou&s;e of Lords to make an Amendment in the&s;e Bills. So tenacious are they of this Privi|lege, &s;o jealous of any Infringement of the &s;ole and ab&s;olute Right the People have to di&s;po&s;e of their own Money. And what ren|ders this Infringement the more grievous is, that what of our Earnings &s;till remains in our Hands is in a great mea&s;ure deprived of it's Value, &s;o long as the Briti&s;h Parliament con|tinue to claim and exerci&s;e this Power of taxing us; for we cannot ju&s;tly call that <HI>our</HI> Property, which <HI>others</HI> may, when they plea&s;e take away from us again&s;t our Will.</P>
<P>In this re&s;pect we are treated with le&s;s De|cency and Regard than the Romans &s;hewed even to the Provinces which they had con|quered. <HI>They</HI> only determined upon the Sum which each &s;hould furni&s;h, and left every Pro|vince to rai&s;e it in the Manner mo&s;t ea&s;y and convenient to them&s;elves.</P>

The&s;e Officers are by their Com|mi&s;&s;ions inve&s;ted with Powers altogether un|con&s;titutional, and entirely de&s;tructive to that Security which we have a right to enjoy; and to the la&s;t degree dangerous, not only to our property, but to our lives: For the Commi&s;|&s;ioners of his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms in America, or any three of them, are by their Commi&s;|&s;ion impowered, "by writing under their hands and &s;eals to con&s;titute and appoint infe|rior Officers in all and &s;ingular the Port within the Limits of their Commi&s;&s;ions." Each of the&s;e petty officers &s;o made is intru&s;ted with Power more ab&s;olute and arbitrary than ought to be lodged in the hands of any Man or Body of Men what&s;oever; for in the Comm&s;&s;ion afore|mentioned, his Maje&s;ty gives and grants unto his &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners, or any three of them, and to all and every the Collectors, Deputy-Collectors, Mini&s;ters, Servants, and all other Officers &s;erving &amp; attending in all and every the
<PB N="16" REF="012332_0019_0F88C8CDE5E700C0">
Ports &amp; other Places within the Limits of their Commi&s;&s;ion, full Power and Authority, from time to time, at their or any of their Wills and Plea&s;ures, as well by Night as by Day, to enter and go on board any Ship, Boat, or other Ve&s;&s;el, riding, lying, or being within, or com|ing into, any Port, Harbour, Creek or Haven, within the limits of their Commi&s;&s;ion; and al&s;o in the day-time to go into any Hou&s;e, Shop, Cellar, or any other Place, where any Goods, Wares or Merchandizes lie concealed, or are <HI>&s;u&s;|pected</HI> to lie concealed, whereof the cu&s;toms and other duties, have not been, or &s;hall not be, duly paid and truly &s;atisfied, an&s;wered or paid unto the Collectors, Deputy-Collectors, Mini&s;ters, Servants, and other Officers re&s;pectively, or otherwi&s;e agreed for; and the &s;aid Hou&s;e, Shop, Warehou&s;e, Cellar, and other Place to &s;earch and &s;urvey, and all and every the Boxes, Trunks, Che&s;ts and Packs then and there found to break open."</P>
<P>Thus our Hou&s;es, and even our Bed-Cham|bers, are expo&s;ed to be ran&s;acked, our Boxes, Trunks and Che&s;ts broke open, ravaged and plundered, by Wretches, whom no prudent Man would venture to employ even as menial Servants; whenever they are plea&s;ed to &s;ay they <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> there are in the Hou&s;e, Wares, &amp;c. for which the Duties have not been paid. Flagrant in|&s;tances of the wanton exerci&s;e of this Power,
<PB N="17" REF="012332_0020_0F88C8CE7289A710">
have frequently happened in this and other &s;eaport Towns. By this we are cut off from that dome&s;tic &s;ecurity which renders the Lives of the mo&s;t unhappy in &s;ome mea&s;ure agreeable. The&s;e Officers may under color of Law and the cloak of a general warrant, break through the &s;acred Rights of the <HI>Domicil,</HI> ran&s;ack Mens Hou&s;es, de&s;troy their Securities, carry off their Property, and with little Danger to them&s;elves commit the mo&s;t horrid Murders.</P>
<P>And we complain of it as a further Grie|vance, that notwith&s;tanding by the Charter of this Province, the Governor and the Great and General Court or A&s;&s;embly of this province or Territory, for the time being, &s;hall have full power and authority, from time to time, to make, ordain and e&s;tabli&s;h all manner of whole|&s;ome and rea&s;onable Laws, Orders, Statutes, and Ordinances, Directions and In&s;tructions, and that if the &s;ame &s;hall not within the term of three years after pre&s;enting the &s;ame to his Maje&s;ty in Privy Council be di&s;allowed, they &s;hall be and continue in full force and effect, until the &s;ame &s;hall be repealed by the Great and General A&s;&s;embly of this province: Yet the Parliament of Great-Britain have rendered, or attempted to render, null and void, a Law of this province, made and pa&s;&s;ed in the Reign of his late Maje&s;ty George the Fir&s;t, intituled, "An Act &s;tating the Fees of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="012332_0021_0F88C8CF4B9AB400">
Officers within this province," and by meer dint of power, in violation of the Charter afore&s;aid, e&s;tabli&s;hed other and exorbitant Fees, for the &s;ame Officers; any Law, of the province, to the contrary notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Fleets and Armies have been intro|duced to &s;upport the&s;e uncon&s;titutional Officers in collecting and managing this uncon&s;titutional Revenue; and Troops have been quartered in this Metropolis for that purpo&s;e. Introducing and quartering Standing Armies in a free Country in times of Peace, without the con|&s;ent of the People either by them&s;elves or by their Repre&s;entatives, is, and always has been deemed, a violation of their Rights as Freemen; and of the Charter or Compact made between the King of Great Britain and the People of this Province, whereby all the Rights of Briti&s;h Subjects are confirmed to us.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. The Revenue ari&s;ing from this Tax uncon&s;titutionally laid, and committed to the management of Per&s;ons arbitrarily appointed and &s;upported by an armed Force quartered in a free City, has been in part applied to the mo&s;t de&s;tructive purpo&s;es. It is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary in a mixt Government, like that of this Province, that a due proportion or balance of Power &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed among the &s;everal Branches of the Legi&s;lative. Our Ance&s;tors
<PB N="19" REF="012332_0022_0F88C8D00FFE19D8">
received from King William and Queen Mary a Charter, by which it was under&s;tood by both Parties in the contract, that &s;uch a proportion or balance was fixed; and therefore every thing which renders any one Branch of the Legi&s;lative more independent of the other two than it was originally de&s;igned, is an alteration of the Con|&s;titution as &s;ettled by the Charter; and as it has been, until the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this Revenue, the con&s;tant practice of the general A&s;&s;embly to provide for the &s;upport of Government, &s;o it is an e&s;&s;ential part of our Con&s;titution, as it is a nece&s;&s;ary means of pre&s;erving an <HI>Equilibrium,</HI> without which we cannot continue a free State.</P>
<P>In particular it has always been held, that the dependence of the Governor of this Province upon the General A&s;&s;embly for his &s;upport, was nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of this <HI>Equilibrium;</HI> neverthele&s;s his Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to ap|ply Fifteen Hundred Pounds Sterling annually, out of the American Revenue, for the &s;up|port of the Governor of this Province indepen|dent of the A&s;&s;embly; whereby the ancient con|nection between him and this People is weaken|ed, the Confidence in the Governor le&s;&s;ened, the Equilibrium de&s;troyed, and the Con&s;titution e&s;&s;entially altered.</P>
<P>And we look upon it highly probable, from the be&s;t intelligence we have been able to ob|tain, that not only our Governor and Lieutenant
<PB N="20" REF="012332_0023_0F88C8D0AAB92628">
Governor, but the Judges of the Superior Court of Judicature, as al&s;o the King's Attorney and Solicitor General are to receive their Support from this grievous tribute. This will, if accom|pli&s;h'd, compleat our Slavery: For if Taxes are to be rai&s;ed from us by the Parliament of Great Britain without our con&s;ent, and the Men on who&s;e opinions and deci&s;ions our Properties, Liberties, and Lives, in a great mea&s;ure depend, receive their Support from the Revenues ari&s;ing from the&s;e Taxes, we cannot, when we think on the depravity of mankind, avoid looking with horror on the danger to which we are expo&s;ed! The Briti&s;h Parliament have &s;hown their wi&s;dom in making the Judges there as independent as po&s;&s;ible both on the Prince and People, both for place and &s;upport: But our Judges hold their commi&s;&s;ions only during plea&s;ure; the granting them Salaries out of this Revenue is rendering them dependent on the Crown for their &s;upport. The King, upon his fir&s;t acce&s;|&s;ion to the Throne, for giving the la&s;t Hand to the independency of the Judges in England, not only upon him&s;elf but his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, by re|commending and con&s;enting to an Act of Par|liament, by which the Judges are continued in office, notwith&s;tanding the demi&s;e of the King, which vacates all other Commi&s;&s;ion, was applauded by the whole Nation. How alarming therefore mu&s;t it be to the inhabitants of this province, to find &s;o wide a difference made
<PB N="21" REF="012332_0024_0F88C8D3A0746538">
between the &s;ubjects in Britain and America, as the rendering the Judges here altogether de|pendent on the Crown for their &s;upport.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. We find our&s;elves greatly oppre&s;&s;ed by In&s;tructions &s;ent to our Governor from the Court of Great Britain; whereby the fir&s;t branch of our legi&s;lature is made meerly a mini&s;terial Engine. And the Province has already felt &s;uch effects from the&s;e in&s;tructions, as we think, ju&s;tly intitle us to &s;ay, that they threaten an entire de|struction of our Liberties; and mu&s;t &s;oon, if not check'd, render every branch of our government a u&s;ele&s;s burthen upon the people. We &s;hall point out &s;ome of the alarming effects of the&s;e in&s;tructions which have already taken place.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of in&s;tructions, the Governor has called and adjourned our General A&s;&s;emblies to a place highly inconvenient to the Members and greatly di&s;advantageous to the intere&s;t of the province, even again&s;t his own declared Intention.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of in&s;tructions, the A&s;&s;embly has been prorogued from time to time, when the important concerns of the Province re|quired their meeting.</P>
<P>In obedience to in&s;tructions the General A&s;&s;embly was Anno 1768 di&s;&s;olved by Gover|nor Bernard, becau&s;e they would not con&s;ent to <HI>re&s;cind</HI> the Re&s;olution of a <HI>former</HI> Hou&s;e, and thereby &s;acri&s;ice the Rights of their Con&s;tituents.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="012332_0025_0F88C8D3B8568410">
By an In&s;truction, the honorable his Maje&s;ty's Council are forbid to meet and tran&s;act matters of publick concern as a council of advice to the Governor, unle&s;s called by the Governor; and if they &s;hould from a zealous regard to the Intere&s;t of the province &s;o meet at any time, the Governor is ordered to negative them at the next Election of Councellors. And although by the Charter of this province the Great and General Court have full power and authority to impo&s;e Taxes upon the E&s;tates and per&s;ons of all and every the proprietors and inhabitants of this province, yet the Governor has been forbidden to give his con&s;ent to an act impo&s;ing a Tax for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of government, unle&s;s &s;uch per&s;ons as were pointed out in the &s;aid in&s;truc|tion, were exempted from paying their ju&s;t proportion of &s;aid Tax.</P>
<P>His Excellency has al&s;o pleaded in&s;tructions for giving up the provincial Fortre&s;s, Ca&s;tle William, into the hands of Troops, over whom he had declared he had no controul (and that at a time when they were menacing the &s;laughter of the inhabitants of the town, and our &s;treets were &s;tain'd with the blood which they had barbarou&s;ly &s;hed.) Thus our Go|vernor, appointed and paid from Great-Britain with Money forced from us, is made an in|&s;trument of totally preventing, or at lea&s;t of rendering futile, every attempt of the other

two branches of our Legi&s;lative in favour of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and wronged people: And le&s;t the complaints naturally occa&s;ioned by &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion &s;hould excite compa&s;&s;ion in the royal Brea&s;t, and induce his Maje&s;ty &s;eri|ou&s;ly to &s;et about relieving us from the cruel Bondage and In&s;ults which we, his loyal Sub|jects, have &s;o long &s;uffered, the Governor is for|bidden to con&s;ent to the payment of an Agent to repre&s;ent our grievances at the Court of Great Britain, unle&s;s he, the Governor, con&s;ent to his Election; and we very well know what <HI>the Man mu&s;t be</HI> to who&s;e appointment a Governor, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, will con&s;ent.</P>
<P>While we are mentioning the Infringe|ments of the Rights of this Colony in particular by means of In&s;tructions, we cannot help calling to remembrance the late unexampled Su&s;pen|&s;ion of the Legi&s;lative of a Si&s;ter Colony, <HI>New-York,</HI> by force of an In&s;truction, until they &s;hould comply with an arbitrary act of the Briti&s;h Parliament, for quartering Troops, de|&s;igned, by military execution, to enforce the rai&s;ing of a tribute.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. The extending the power of the Courts of Vice-Admiralty to &s;o enormous a degree, as deprives the people in the colonies, in a great mea&s;ure, of their ine&s;timable right to trials <HI>by
<PB N="24" REF="012332_0027_0F88C8D52BFE2560">
Juries;</HI> which has ever been ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the grand Bulwark and Security of Engli&s;h property.</P>
<P>This alone is &s;ufficient to rou&s;e our jealou&s;y: And we are again obliged to take notice of the remarkable contra&s;t, which the Briti&s;h parlia|ment have been plea&s;ed to exhibit between the Subjects in Great-Britain and the Colonies. In the &s;ame Statute, by which they give up to the deci&s;ion of one dependent intere&s;ted Judge of Admiralty the e&s;tates and properties of the Coloni&s;ts, they expre&s;sly guard the e&s;tates and properties of the People of Great-Britain; For all forfeitures and penalties inflicted by the &s;tatute of the fourth of George the third, or any other Act of Parliament relative to the Trade of the Colonies, may be &s;ued for in any Court of Admiralty in the Colonies; but all penalties and forfeitures which &s;hall be incurred in Great-Britain, may be &s;ued for in any of his Maje&s;ty's Courts of Record in We&s;tmin&s;ter, or in the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, re|&s;pectively. Thus our Birthrights are taken from us; and that too with every mark of in|dignity, in&s;ult and contempt. We may be har|ra&s;&s;ed and dragged from one part of the Con|tinent to the other (which &s;ome of our Bre|thren here and in the country towns already have been) and finally be deprived of our whole property, by the arbitrary determination of one bia&s;&s;ed, capricious Judge of the Admiralty.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="25" REF="012332_0028_0F88C8D5EA4215B0">
9thly. The re&s;training us from erecting Slitting-Mills for manufacturing our Iron the natural produce of this Country, is an Infringe|ment of that Right with which God and Na|ture have inve&s;ted us, to make u&s;e of our &s;kill and indu&s;try in procuring the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of Life. And we look upon the Re&s;traint laid upon the Manufacture and Tran&s;|portation of Hats to be altogether unrea&s;onable and grievous. Although by the Charter all Havens, Rivers, Ports, Waters, &amp;c. are ex|pre&s;ely granted the Inhabitants of the Province and their Succe&s;&s;ors, to their only proper u&s;e and behoof forever, yet the Briti&s;h Parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act, whereby they re&s;train us from carrying our Wool, the produce of our own Farms, even over a Ferry; whereby the Inha|bitants have often been put to the expence of carrying a Bag of Wool near an hundred miles by land, when pa&s;&s;ing over a River or Water of one quarter of a mile, of which the province are the ab&s;olute proprictors, would have pre|vented all that trouble.</P>
<P N="10">10thly. The Act pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h Parliament, intituled. <HI>An Act for the better pre&s;erving his Maje&s;ty's Dock-Yards, Magazines, Ships, Ammunition and Stores,</HI> is, as we apprehend, a violent Infringe|men of our Rights. By this Act, any one of us may be taken from his Family, and carried to
<PB N="26" REF="012332_0029_0F88C8D6B10F5380">
any part of Great-Britain, there to be tried, whenever it &s;hall be pretended that he has been concerned in burning or otherwi&s;e de&s;troying any Boat or Ve&s;&s;el, or any Materials for build|ing. &amp;c. any naval or victualling Store, &amp;c. belonging to his Maje&s;ty. For by this Act all Per&s;ons in the Realm, or in any of the Places thereto belonging (under which Denomination we know the Colonies are meant to be in|cluded) may be indicted or tried either in any County or Shire within this Realm, in like manner and form as if the Offence had been committed in &s;aid County, as his Maje&s;ty and his Succe&s;&s;ors may deem mo&s;t expedient. Thus we are not only deprived of our grand Right to <HI>Trial by our Peers in the Viciuity,</HI> but any per&s;on &s;u&s;pected, or pretended to be &s;u&s;pected, may be hurried to Great-Britain, to take his Trial in any County the King or his Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hall plea&s;e to direct; where, innocent or guilty, he is in great danger of being condomn|ed; and whether condemned or acquitted, he will probably be ruined by the Expence attending the Trial, and his long Ab&s;ence from his Family and Bu&s;ine&s;s; and we have the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to apprehend that we &s;hall &s;oon experience the fatal Effects of this Act, as about the Year 1769, the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment pa&s;&s;ed Re&s;ovles for taking up a number of per&s;ons in the Colonies and carry|ing them to Great-Britain for trial, pretending
<PB N="27" REF="012332_0030_0F88C8D76B9355A0">
that they were authori&s;ed &s;o to do by a Statute pa&s;&s;ed in the Reign of Henry the Eighth in which they &s;ay the Colonies were included, although the Act was pa&s;&s;ed long before any Colonies were &s;ettled, or even in contemplation.</P>
<P N="11">11thly As our Ance&s;tors came over to this Country that they might not only enjoy their civil but their religious Rights, and particularly de&s;ired to be freed from the Prelates, who in tho&s;e times cruelly per&s;ecuted all who differed in &s;entiment from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church; we cannot &s;ee without concern, the various at|tempts which have been made, and are now making, to e&s;tabli&s;h an American Epi&s;copate. Our Epi&s;copal brethren of the Colonies do en|joy, and nightfully ought over to enjoy, the free exerci&s;e of their Religion; but as an American Epi&s;copate is by no means e&s;&s;ential to that free exerci&s;e of their Religion, we can|not help fearing that they who are &s;o warmly contending for &s;uch an E&s;tabli&s;hment, have Views altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the univer&s;al and peaceful enjoyment of our Chri&s;tian privi|leges: And doing or attempting to do any thing which has even the remote&s;t tendency to endanger this Enjoyment, is ju&s;tly looked upon a great Grievance, and al&s;o an Infringement of our Rights; which is not barely to exerci&s;e, but peaceably and &s;ecurely to enjoy, that Liberty with which CHRIST hath made us free.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="012332_0031_0F88C8D9F4314078">
And we are further of Opinion, that no Power on Earth can ju&s;tly give either temporal or &s;piritual Juri&s;diction within this Province, except the Great &amp; General Court. We think there|fore that every de&s;ign for e&s;tabli&s;hing the Juri&s;|diction of a Bi&s;hop in this Province, is a de&s;ign both again&s;t our civil and religious Rights: And we are well informed, that the more can|did &amp; judicious of our Brethren of the Church of England in this and the other Colonies, both Clergy and Laity, conceive of the e&s;tabli&s;hing an American Epi&s;copate both unnece&s;&s;ary and unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P N="12">12thly. Another Grievance under which we labour is, The frequent Alteration of the Bounds of the Colonies by Deci&s;ions before the King and Council, explanatory of former Grants and Charters. This not only &s;ubjects Men to live under a Con&s;titution to which they have not con&s;ented, which in it&s;elf is a great Grievance; but morevover under Color, that the <HI>Right of Soil</HI> is affected by &s;uch Declara|tions, &s;ome Governors, or Mini&s;ters, or both in Conjunction, have pretended to grant in Con|&s;equence of a Mandamus many Thou&s;ands of Acres of vacant and appropriated Lands near a Century pa&s;t, and rendered valuable by the Labors of the pre&s;ent Cultivators and their Ance&s;tors. There are very notable In|&s;tances of Settlers, who having fir&s;t purcha&s;ed
<PB N="29" REF="012332_0032_0F88C8DA6E40C648">
the Soil of the Natives, have at con&s;iderable Expence obtained Confirmations of Title from this Province; and, on being transfer'd to the Juri&s;diction of the Province of <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> have been put to the Trouble and Co&s;t of a new Grant or Confirmation from thence; and after all this, there has been a third Declaration of the Royal Will, that they &s;hou'd thence|forth be con&s;idered as pertaining to the Pro|vince of <HI>New-York.</HI> The Troubles, Expences and Dangers which Hundreds have been put to on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, cannot here be recited; but &s;o much may be &s;aid, that they have been mo&s;t cruelly harra&s;&s;ed, and even threatened with a military Force, to dragoon them into a Com|pliance with the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable Demands.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>BOSTON, <DATE><HI>November</HI> 20, 1772.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE, the Freeholders and other Inhabitants of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in Town-Meeting duly a&s;&s;em|bled, according to Law, apprehending there is abundant Rea&s;on to be alarmed that the Plan of <HI>De&s;poti&s;m,</HI> which the Enemies of our invaluable Rights have concerted, is rapidly ha&s;tening to a completion, can no longer conceal our im|patience under a con&s;tant, unremitted, uniform Aim to in&s;lave us, or con&s;ide in an Admini&s;tra|tion which threatens us with certain and ine|vitable de&s;truction. But, when in Addition to the repeated Inroads made upon the Rights and Liberties of the Coloni&s;ts, and of tho&s;e in this Province in particular, we reflect on the late extraordinary Mea&s;ure in affixing Stipends, or Salaries from the Crown to the Offices of the
<PB N="31" REF="012332_0034_0F88C8DBF17D5F60">
Judges of the Superior Court of Judicature, making them not only intirely independent of the People, who&s;e Lives and Fortunes are &s;o much in their Power, but ab&s;olutely dependent on the Crown, (which may hereafter be worn by a <HI>Tyrant</HI>) both for their Appointment and Support, we cannot but be extremely alarm'd at the mi&s;chievous Tendency of this Innovation; which, in our Opinion is directly contrary to the Spirit of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, pregnant with innumerable Evils, &amp; hath a direct Tenden|cy to deprive us of every thing valuable as Men, as Chri&s;tians, and as Subjects, entitled, by the Royal Charter, to all the Rights, Liberties and Privileges of native Britons. Such being the critical State of this Province, we think it our Duty on this truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ion, to a&s;k you, What can with&s;tand the Attacks of mere Power?

<P>THE Freeholders and other Inhabitants of the Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> legally a&s;&s;embled in <HI>Faneuil-Hall,</HI> beg Leave to acquaint your Excellency, that a Report has prevailed, which they have rea&s;on to apprehend is well ground|ed, that Stipends are affixed to the Offices of the Judges of the Superior Court of Judica|ture, &amp;c. of this Province, whereby they are become Independent of the Grants of the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly for their Support; contrary to ancient and invariable U&s;age. This Report has &s;pread an Alarm among all con&s;iderate per&s;ons who have heard of it in Town and Country; being viewed, as tending rapidly to compleat the Sy&s;tem of their Slavery; which originated in the Hou&s;e of Commons of Great-Britain, a&s;&s;uming a Power and Authority, to give and grant the Monies of the Coloni&s;ts without their Con&s;ent, and agin&s;t their repeated Re|mon&s;trances. And, as the Judges hold their
