<HEAD>THE IMPORTANCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WITHIN the&s;e few Years frequent have been the Alarms that the State was in Danger, nor would I venture to affirm that they have always been without Foundation. We have had power|ful Enemies abroad, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Allies to &s;upport, Rebellion at home, Faction and Di&s;content among the People, which has ri&s;en to an enor|mous Height, and has even extended it&s;elf to our Colonies in <HI>North America,</HI> where the Spirit of Riot has broke out at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and with the utmo&s;t Violence attacked &s;everal of the Kings's Officers, plundered their Hou&s;es, and robbed them of their Effects, and &s;et Government at Defiance. Encouraged by this Example, the Multitude at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="010471_0004_0F7FC371D6B97D58">
were proceeding to the &s;ame Violences, &s;o that &s;ome of the prin|cipal Inhabitants, it is &s;aid, were obliged to betake them&s;elves to Ships to avoid their Rage. How alarming are &s;uch Acts of Violence in a civilized Country, and &s;ubver&s;ive of all Order and good Government, which every good and loyal Subject ought to &s;upport to the utmo&s;t of his Power? But altho' the other Colonies, much to their Honour, have not proceeded to &s;uch Violence, yet we are well a&s;&s;ured that great Unea&s;ine&s;s and Di&s;content prevails in all of them, on account of an Act of Parliament, impo&s;ing a Stamp-Duty, to which, they &s;ay, if they &s;ub|mit, it will be an Introduction to all the Variety of Taxes which are paid in <HI>England,</HI> be&s;ides the numerous Taxes impo&s;ed on them by their own Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tify them&s;elves in this Di&s;obedience to the Act, they pre&s;ume to call the Right of the Hou&s;e of Commons over them in que&s;tion. This is a Matter of &s;uch Importance, that it cannot fail of being one of the fir&s;t Things con&s;idered by that augu&s;t Hou&s;e, when their own Dignity, and Ju&s;tice to the Colonies, I hope, will both be defended and &s;upported; and in the mean Time I wi&s;h to &s;ee the Mini&s;try act with Spirit on this mo&s;t important Occa&s;ion, but &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee their Actions were mere Deeds of Power; for it &s;hould always be remembered, that the Colonies are our Brethren and Fellow-Subjects, free-born <HI>Britons</HI> equally as we are, and intitled equally with us to every Right and Privilege of <HI>Britons.</HI> We &s;hould inquire, there|fore, whether we have behaved to them as Brethren? and whether we have not exacted from them what we &s;hould have judged extremely hard to have &s;uffered our&s;elves? The fir&s;t Right of a <HI>Briton</HI> is, that he
<PB N="3" REF="010471_0005_0F7FC3726DB48408">
cannot be tried but by his Peers; the next, that he cannot be taxed but by a Parliament, in which he is repre&s;ented, or by Gentlemen who pay a Share of the Tax they impo&s;e on him; for the Law, not tru&s;ting too much to Virtue, wi&s;ely proceeds on this Suppo&s;ition, that however inattentive a Man may be to the Concerns of others, he will probably pay &s;ome Regard to his own Intere&s;t; and it is in this View that the Law requires a Man to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a certain E&s;tate, to in|title him to repre&s;ent others. Are the Colonies then in this Manner repre&s;ented in the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> Do tho&s;e who impo&s;e Taxes on them pay al&s;o a Share of tho&s;e Taxes? If this is not the Ca&s;e, what have the Colonies done that they &s;hould be &s;tripped of one of the mo&s;t valuable Privileges of <HI>Britons?</HI> Have the Parliament a Right to take from the lowe&s;t of the Subjects the &s;malle&s;t Privilege which he in|herits, unle&s;s forfeited by Law? Do not mi&s;under&s;tand me. I do not by any Means call the Power of Parliament in que&s;tion; I know they are in many Ca&s;es omnipotent; they may, of Power, pa&s;s a Law by which any Colony &s;hould be deprived the Privilege of being tried by Jury; but I a&s;k, could they of Right do it? for between Power and Right is a very great Difference.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, and I believe truly, that, in 1763, when the Sugar-Act pa&s;&s;ed, that the Stamp-Duty was then under Con&s;ideration; but the evil Con&s;equence being repre&s;ented, it was re&s;olved by the then Mini|&s;try to put it off, in order to have the Sen&s;e of the Colonies on it; they, therefore, la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions would have applied by Petition to Parlia|ment again&s;t the Manner of impo&s;ing the Stamp-Act; but I am in|formed no Member would pre&s;ent their Petitions, for it &s;eems it was
<PB N="4" REF="010471_0006_0F7FC37339C352B0">
again&s;t the Forms of the Hou&s;e. That honourable Hou&s;e ought to know be&s;t whether Forms ought to &s;tand in the Way of Right, e&s;peci|ally when &s;o great a Part of this Empire de&s;ired to be heard: If a Charter of Magna Charta had been the Impediment, it &s;hould be re|moved, it &s;hould be annulled.</P>
<P>This Rejection to be heard, has cau&s;ed all the Colonies to re&s;olve to &s;end Deputies from their A&s;&s;emblies to meet at <HI>New-York</HI>; from whence, it is probable, they will again attempt to petition Parliament. If their Demands are rea&s;onable, Ju&s;tice requires that &s;o va&s;t a Part of this Empire &s;hould be heard; and I am well convinced that they will demand nothing that is unrea&s;onable, or incon&s;i&s;tent with the Laws.</P>
<P>The utmo&s;t Wi&s;dom of Parliament will be wanted on this mo&s;t important Occa&s;ion; and no Member, it is hoped, will advi&s;e an im|proper Exertion of Power. It is the true Intere&s;t of <HI>Britain</HI> to acquire and retain, not to alienate the Affections of her Colonies, which &s;urpa&s;s mo&s;t Kingdoms of <HI>Europe</HI> in Power and Number of People; and this can only be done by kind U&s;age, and always con&s;idering them, as they mo&s;t certainly are in all Re&s;pects, on the &s;ame Footing with our&s;elves, and of Right intitled to every Privilege that we in <HI>England</HI> enjoy.</P>
<P>The Colonies are &s;o many di&s;tant Provinces of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire, and which add great Dignity and Power to it, and will continue to do &s;o infinitely more; but if, in&s;tead of improving this va&s;t Acce&s;&s;ion of Dominion to our mutual Advantage, we make Enemies of our Friends and Fellow Subjects, and thereby convert this Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven into
<PB N="5" REF="010471_0007_0F7FC373E7B884A0">
a Cur&s;e, then, indeed, we may have Cau&s;e to weep, and to mourn over our late Conque&s;ts, whil&s;t every Power in <HI>Europe</HI> would rejoice in our Divi&s;ions and Di&s;tractions, which they already do, and will not fail to encourage.</P>
<P>Never, therefore, did the Welfare, and even Independence, of this Kingdom call more for the utmo&s;t Wi&s;dom and united Coun&s;els of the Government, than on this mo&s;t important Occa&s;ion; for it &s;hould be remembered, that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire on the Continent of <HI>North-Ame|rica</HI> extends more than 2000 Miles, in which is every Kind of Soil and Climate, and therefore yields, in great Plenty, near all the Pro|ductions of <HI>Europe,</HI> and is certainly capable of producing every Kind of Fruits that any Part of the World is known to afford.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings of Life, they have all the Sinews of Power. The Earth is known to contain innumerable Iron Mines, endle&s;s Fo|re&s;ts of Oak and other Timber, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax; va&s;t Banks, Rivers, Bays, Harbours, abounding with the greate&s;t Fi&s;heries on the Globe; &s;o that not a Doubt can be entertained that this va&s;t Country will, in Time, become the greate&s;t Empire that the World has ever &s;een; and this Opinion is confirmed by the rapid Progre&s;s they have made &s;ince 1621, when a few per&s;ecuted People fir&s;t went thither, and who are now become near three Millions; the&s;e, in a Country where Land is &s;o ea&s;ily had, and which occa&s;ions early Marriages, cannot fail, in twenty-five Years, of becoming &s;ix Millions, which is about equal to the People of <HI>England</HI>; and this Increa&s;e will continue in a Coun|try, who&s;e Bounds we&s;tward are unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010471_0008_0F7FC375D72F8430">This is &s;uch a &s;triking Pro&s;pect of increa&s;ing Population in tho&s;e Regions, as &s;hould induce us to de&s;ert the Idea of being long able to &s;ubject them to our Power. They have already often aided us in our <HI>American</HI> Wars, and they will &s;oon be able to do &s;o in <HI>Europe</HI>; we ought therefore to adopt true Policy, which, is, to rule them with Lenity, for that only can continue for Ages, what an Exertion of Power might fail to &s;ecure for a few Years.</P>
<P>The great Unea&s;ine&s;s and Di&s;content of the Colonies, having taken its Ri&s;e from the Stamp Duty laid on them; this, we &s;ee, has &s;et them upon e&s;timating for them&s;elves, and of their Utility to us; and accordingly they &s;et a Value upon them&s;elves, and we ought to be aware how very &s;trongly the E&s;timation of their own Utility will on all Occa&s;ions operate on their Minds. The <HI>North-Americans</HI> &s;ay, they have been toiling for the Mother-Country; that the Fruits of all their Labour centers here; that therefore, if they are not con&s;idered as Children, their Treatment is that of Slaves, and therefore, if oppre&s;&s;ed, they mu&s;t unite. They accordingly cry out for Union, which has pro|duced a Congre&s;s of all the Colonies, who&s;e Deputies are now a&s;&s;em|bled at <HI>New-York,</HI> which is fir&s;t propo&s;ed for Repre&s;entation only; but &s;hould they not &s;ucceed, we &s;hould be aware of what they may next proceed to con&s;ult on; as al&s;o what may prove the Con&s;equence of rooted Hatred and De&s;peration.</P>
<P>I therefore cannot help cen&s;uring tho&s;e to be tyrannic Principles, which are for dragooning, and an Exertion of Power and Authority, be|cau&s;e I am well convinced that true Policy often dictates to Authority
<PB N="7" REF="010471_0009_0F7FC376548305B8">
to yield upon critical Exigencies; the highe&s;t Authority has often done it with true Wi&s;dom, in this Kingdom, as in the propo&s;ed Exci&s;e on Wine and Tobacco in 1733, and in 1755 repealing the Jew Bill. We ought always to give Applau&s;e to tho&s;e who, by re&s;toring Har|mony, prevent De&s;peration.</P>
<P>True Principles of Policy and Commerce, abhor <HI>Re&s;trictions</HI> that tend to prevent our Colonies of <HI>North-America</HI> from enriching them|&s;elves by other States, for &s;uch are a Prejudice to the Mother-Coun|try; becau&s;e all the Riches which they acquire, mu&s;t, in &s;ome Shape or other, center here; and to prove this, you can have no better Au|thority than the Cour&s;e of Exchange; and how immen&s;ely that is again&s;t the Colonies, mu&s;t be known to all Men. Whatever there|fore they get, they only &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves, being always kept in a State of deep Debt to us. What can we de&s;ire more? And whom can we injure more by Re&s;trictions and &s;evere Laws than our&s;elves?</P>
<P>Re&s;traints on their Trade then certainly is very impolitic; for what|ver Trade they carry on, if they get but a Balance in their Favour, it mu&s;t turn to our Advantage; and &s;urely, of all In&s;truments for ruining and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Trade, Military and Marine are the mo&s;t dete&s;table; their arbitrary Principles are incompatible with Commerce, which can never flouri&s;h but with Mildne&s;s and Encouragement; nor ought Vice Admiralty Courts to be intru&s;ted with Power over Commerce.</P>
<P>As to the Stamp and other Taxes, if they have not Money enough even to pay for our Manufactures, nothing can be gained by attempt|ing
<PB N="8" REF="010471_0010_0F7FC376E945B838">
to tax them; becau&s;e if you take their Money for Taxes, you lo&s;e it in Commerce, which mu&s;t end in the Ruin of your Merchants, and numerous Manufacturers; for what is gained by Taxes is &s;o much Lo&s;s to Trade; the draining therefore from them every Farthing of their Money by Trade, and then demanding from them more by Taxes, is ab&s;olutely reducing them to <HI>Egyptian</HI> Slavery, of making Bricks without Straw.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the great Object with Regard to <HI>North-America</HI> is vending our Manufactures, which, the more they are enabled to buy, &s;o much the better it mu&s;t be for us in the Employment of our People at home, and the Returns we receive; and the le&s;s we &s;tudy to perplex our|&s;elves, by attempting to tax them, the more it will be to our Advan|tage, and contribute to the Peace and Pro&s;perity of both Countries.</P>
<P>The ruling Policy of every State is unque&s;tionably Self-Intere&s;t; the Policy therefore of every State of <HI>Europe,</HI> and particularly our inveterate Enemies, mu&s;t induce them to wi&s;h a Revolt of our Colonies on the Continent of <HI>North-America</HI>; and they would not fail of &s;upporting them, either openly or &s;ecretly, in doing it, whereby that whole Con|tinent would be thrown open to them in Point of Trade, which this Kingdom now alone enjoys. The Part which both <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> took when <HI>Holland</HI> revolted from <HI>Spain,</HI> proves that my Apprehen&s;ions are not ill grounded; if therefore Severity is u&s;ed, to inforce an unpo|pular Act, and that De&s;peration &s;hould en&s;ue, it would not only be Matter of great Joy to our inveterate Enemies, but they would &s;econd &s;uch Di&s;obedience with all their Power, in order to confirm it, and
<PB N="9" REF="010471_0011_0F7FC377CB2E7128">
thereby hope to reduce the Dignity and Power of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; and in &s;uch dreadful Situation, which (God forbid) the Evil would not &s;top in <HI>North America,</HI> for the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> would mo&s;t probably follow the Fortune of the Continent. It &s;hould always be remembered, that <HI>Spain</HI> lo&s;t both <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> by her Acts of Severity; and in tho&s;e famous Revolutions every Power of <HI>Europe</HI> rejoiced. We ought therefore to be very careful in our Conduct towards the <HI>Americans,</HI> whom, in all Probability, every Power in <HI>Europe</HI> would encourage to Rebellion, whereby they would greatly weaken this Kingdom, and advance their own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Such Con&s;iderations as the&s;e &s;hould point out to this Kingdom the right Rule of Policy to be pur&s;ued with regard to our Colonies, which contain near three Millions of People; and this Rule is, to acquire and retain by Acts of Lenity and Mildne&s;s, the Affections of our Colonies, and not to alienate them by Severity; for the Time will approach, in which it will become extremely dangerous to attempt ruling &s;o va&s;t a Continent, already abounding with Millions, by the Iron Rod of Power, the Sway of which will only make them the &s;ooner refractory; and when the Fire of Re&s;i&s;tance is once kindled, there is no fore&s;eeing how far it may &s;pread. The De&s;ire of Independence is inherent in all Men, and few will long bear even imaginary Grievances, with the Means in their Hands, however de&s;perate, of &s;haking them off. This has been &s;een in <HI>Rome,</HI> which was once the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the World, the Seat of Arts, Empire, and Glory; but who, by her Oppre&s;&s;ion of a Part of <HI>A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> and the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> which could no longer bear the Severity of her Government, forced them to renounce her Ju|ri&s;diction, and &s;et up for them&s;elves; in con&s;equence of which, great
<PB N="10" REF="010471_0012_0F7FC37867A4D590">
Kingdoms aro&s;e; and this Country, (<HI>Britain</HI>) antiently the Je&s;t of the polite <HI>Romans,</HI> became the happy Seat of Liberty, Plenty, and Power, whil&s;t her former Sovereign (<HI>Rome</HI>) lies &s;unk into Slavery, Ignorance, and Poverty. Let this be a Warning to us how we conduct our&s;elves to our Colonies, who, for the fir&s;t Time, are now united in a Congre&s;s at <HI>New-York</HI>; from this Union of their Councils, we cannot tell what they will re&s;olve, but, from all Accounts, many of the People &s;eem ripe for De&s;peration, becau&s;e they think them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed. We &s;hould remember that they are <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and many of them inherit from their Ance&s;tors republican Principles, which they carried thither during the civil Wars; being per&s;ecuted here, they fled to the Fore&s;ts of <HI>America</HI> for the Sake of Liberty; their Sons are all of them ac|tuated by the &s;ame Principles of Liberty, which Spirit perhaps is more prevalent there than in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons great Care ought to be taken in our Conduct to|wards the <HI>Americans.</HI> To attract willing Obedience from them mu&s;t al|ways be more &s;afe than to exact it by Compul&s;ion; and it can never de&s;erve Reproach to correct human Policy and Error. The Rulers of Kingdoms, no more than other Men, are always wi&s;e; and when they are not &s;o, it is happy if they &s;ee their Errors before it is too late, and not per&s;evere in them through Ob&s;tinacy, rather than di&s;cover to the World that they have been wrong, as has frequently been the Ca&s;e, even to the producing the very wor&s;t Effects; but we are at pre&s;ent expo&s;ed to no &s;uch Hazard from the Mea&s;ures that have embroiled our Colonies, becau&s;e our pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters cannot be intere&s;ted in the covering or &s;upporting the Errors of the la&s;t. I hope in the&s;e Thoughts to be rightly under&s;tood; my Meaning is, to point out the
<PB N="11" REF="010471_0013_0F7FC37B011FA0D0">
true Policy that I think this Kingdom ought to pur&s;ue; for the &s;ingle Object of Union between us and the Colonies, is undoubtedly Conve|nience and Self-intere&s;t; for if we had no Views of reaping Profit, or an Acce&s;&s;ion of Power from <HI>North-America,</HI> we &s;hould not concern our&s;elves farther about them, than to prevent their falling into other Hands, to the endangering us: And the Affection of the <HI>North-Ameri|cans</HI> to this Nation, from which they &s;prung, together with the Pro|tection which they received in their infant State, &s;ecures their Duty and Loyalty.</P>
<P>But in all Debates at this Time, too much Stre&s;s is laid on that Pro|tection, &s;ince whatever we did for them was with a View to &s;erve our|&s;elves; and, to &s;peak the Truth, our per&s;ecuting the Di&s;&s;enters in the Times of <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> I. by Commi&s;&s;ion and Spiritual Courts, compelled the Ance&s;tors of the People of <HI>New-England</HI> to fly thither from Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tyranny.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Spirit of Per&s;ecution prevailed again&s;t the Quakers in the latter End of the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. and, being made very unea&s;y thro' Popi&s;h Bigotry, Mr. <HI>Penn,</HI> that modern <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> &s;olicited and obtained a Grant of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> Thither he took great Numbers of Quakers at his own Expence, which were followed by many others, in order there to enjoy their innocent and con&s;cientious Opinions.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that the four Colonies of <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania</HI> were peopled by our Per&s;ecution, and without receiving any other Aid than that of Protection only, and for which they have not been un|grateful; for it &s;hould be remembered, that, in con&s;equence of our Wars in <HI>Europe,</HI> whenever we &s;ent an Expedition to <HI>America,</HI> we have always been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by our Colonies, to the utmo&s;t of their Power; for in
<PB N="12" REF="010471_0014_0F7FC37B6BE1EEB8">
1690, when Sir <HI>William Phipps</HI> was &s;ent again&s;t <HI>Canada, New-England</HI> alone &s;ent 3000 Men and forty Tran&s;ports; and in the Expedition un|der General <HI>Hill,</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> again&s;t the &s;ame Coun|try, the Colonies &s;ent 6000 Men.

During the late War they had 20,000 Men in Arms again&s;t the Enemy in <HI>North-Ame|rica,</HI> and when the <HI>French</HI> were totally conquered there, they &s;econded our De&s;igns in <HI>South-America</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Havannah,</HI> which important Place, it is &s;aid, would not have been taken, but by the &s;ea&s;onable Ar|rival of the Troops from <HI>New-York,</HI> when our own were &s;wept away by a raging Di&s;temper: For the&s;e, and many more of their Services, Duty, and Loyalty, they claim the Liberty of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects, and to which they affirm they have an hereditary Right.</P>
<P>They have now no <HI>European</HI> Power that they can dread in their Neighbourhood, and their own internal Power is very con&s;iderable, and this will increa&s;e very fa&s;t, which a ju&s;t and gentle Sway may for Ages connect to this Kingdom; they will be held to it by the Ties of Con&s;anguinity, Religion, Language, Manners, Cu&s;toms, and Laws; the&s;e, with good U&s;age, will long &s;ecure them to us; for they will always con&s;ider us as their &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t Friend in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<P>The Advantages which we &s;eek from the Colonies are in a commer|cial Way, and as they add to our Power, we &s;hould therefore, by Plans of mild Government, attract them as Colonies re&s;pectively; and we &s;hould rather make them Rivals for our Favour, than united Friends in oppo&s;ing us. We mu&s;t not think that the <HI>North-Americans,</HI> who have a watchful Eye over our Proceedings, and are greatly jealous of their Liberty, will &s;uffer their Properties and Intere&s;ts to be mi&s;applied. <HI>America</HI> is every Year growing more inviting, and <HI>Great-Britain</HI> per|haps more di&s;gu&s;ting; in which Ca&s;e her Strength will increa&s;e, whil&s;t our's will decrea&s;e, for we daily &s;ee many of our Manufacturers and u&s;eful People getting on that Side of the Water. In &s;hort, the Means mo&s;t apparently &s;olid for &s;ecuring our Colonies to us, mu&s;t be, to fa|vour their Indu&s;try in every Way but manufacturing, and &s;ecuring to our&s;elves the Fruits thereof, by furni&s;hing them with our Manufactures on cheaper Terms than they can procure them el&s;ewhere; this will tend to promote mutual Harmony and Pro&s;perity, and a la&s;ting Union with our Colonies re&s;pectively, without weakening their natural Rivalries, which, tho' we need not foment, we &s;hould not wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en, nor by any Means by unpopular Acts drive them to Union; but this unfortu|nately has been done by the Stamp-Act, &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing which, and the Sugar-Act of 1763, great Numbers of our Manufacturers have been in|vited

and are gone to &s;ettle in <HI>North-America,</HI> the Effects of which are already, and will &s;oon be much more &s;everely felt in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>It is a mi&s;taken Policy to attempt making the <HI>North-Americans</HI> Slaves to our Intere&s;t or Power, for they are too knowing to be made the former, and too high &s;pirited to become the latter; the only Way to keep them dependent on this Kingdom, mu&s;t proceed from the Wi&s;|dom and Rectitude of the Government; no di&s;tinct Intere&s;t mu&s;t be pur&s;ued, and, above all, the landed Intere&s;t mu&s;t not be favoured at the Expence of the commercial; for the landed Intere&s;t can only be &s;upported by the Pro&s;perity of Commerce, in which we &s;hould in|dulge the <HI>Americans</HI> as much as in our Power, and thereby take off their Attention from becoming Manufacturers. This only is true Po|licy, and on &s;uch Principles we &s;hould begin with preventing them from being harra&s;&s;ed by Vice Admiralty Courts, and remove every exi&s;ting Cau&s;e of ju&s;t Complaint, and we &s;hould con&s;ider their Pro&s;perity as the Source of our Riches; by this Conduct we &s;hould re&s;tore Content and Harmony both here, there, and between us. This is the true Sy&s;tem which I think ought to be ob&s;erved, and tho&s;e who fail in pur&s;uing it, will be the ju&s;t Abhorrence both of <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Americans.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the Stamp-Act, in the Preamble of which it is &s;aid to be ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary that Provi&s;ion be made for rai&s;ing a further Revenue toward defraying the Expences of defending, protecting, and &s;ecuring the Colonies in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>It would not only be imprudent, but ill become me to attack the Wi&s;|dom of that Hou&s;e, of which I always de&s;ire to think and &s;peak with
<PB N="15" REF="010471_0017_0F7FC37F2C152FD0">
Re&s;pect; but I cannot help remarking, that for a Century pa&s;t, whil&s;t <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Loui&s;iana</HI> were in the Hands of <HI>France,</HI> the Colonies wanted no &s;uch Defence or Security from <HI>England,</HI> for they defended them|&s;elves; but now, when <HI>Loui&s;iana, Cape-Breton,</HI> and <HI>Canada</HI> are all re|duced to the Obedience of, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> now that there is not a <HI>French</HI> Subject left on that Continent, it is tho't nece&s;&s;ary to keep a con&s;iderable Army in the Colonies, for the Sup|port of which this grievous and unpopular Act is impo&s;ed; but it has been &s;aid, they are nece&s;&s;ary to reduce the Indians; this, tho' a very idle one, I know was the Pretext. The Colonies have defended them|&s;elves a hundred Years &s;ince again&s;t the Indians, and are they now all of a &s;udden become unable, with the Addition of &s;everal hundred thou&s;and Men? This is extraordinary indeed! But if the Indians were not in|clined to live in Peace, it would be very hard if the Colonies could not bring them to Subjection without the Crown keeping a numerous Body of Troops in a Country where Soldiers are &s;o very di&s;agreeable; and not only &s;o, but to lay heavy Duties on Merchandize and even a Stamp-Tax, for the Support of &s;uch Troops, and in a Country where every Man by Beat of Drum is obliged to appear under Arms; for all the Colonies are formed in a regular and well-di&s;ciplined Militia; and they are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their Numbers, that they would be ex|tremely glad to &s;ee every Soldier embark for <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince they are are of no U&s;e, but a Burthen to the Colonies, who&s;e real Defence and Protection is received from the Valour of their own native Militia; nor have they an Enemy worth Notice within 3000 of them.</P>
<P>With the recalling therefore of tho&s;e Troops from among them, the Cau&s;e of the Stamp Tax will be removed; the Colonies would then
<PB N="16" REF="010471_0018_0F7FC37FEF6A65B0">
re&s;ume their Trade, which is now ruined; and their Heads, which are at pre&s;ent full of manufacturing, would be employed on Schemes of Commerce and Navigation; the Fruits of all their Labour would con|tinue to center in <HI>Great-Britain</HI>; and the Language which they now hold, that they are treated not as <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> but as Aliens and Slaves, would immediately &s;ub&s;ide; their Affections and Labours would be united in promoting the Trade and Intere&s;t of this Kingdom, and all Things would return to their late happy and pro&s;perous State.</P>
<P>But it may perhaps be &s;aid, that admitting the Parliament were con|vinced of the Inability of the Colonies paying the Stamp-Duty, and that they were inclined to repeal the Act, but that the <HI>Americans,</HI> by denying the Authority of that augu&s;t Hou&s;e to impo&s;e internal Taxes on them, has, as it were, put it out of the Power of Parliament to repeal the Act, becau&s;e their Dignity is concerned.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, that as to the Authority of Parliament, that augu&s;t Hou&s;e can re&s;olve, that their legi&s;lative Power is not confined to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> but doth extend over the whole <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire; that it is hereditary and inherent in them; and that they will defend and &s;up|port &s;uch their Authority and Dignity whenever Occa&s;ion &s;hall require.</P>
<P>After this, if they are convinced of the Impropriety of the Act, they can, I humbly conceive, con&s;i&s;tently with their Honour, &s;u&s;pend its Execution for twelve Months, or any other Period of Time, till a new Parliament, when &s;ome &s;mall commercial Tax may be laid on them, and this abrogated.</P>
