<HEAD>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM HENRY, EARL of DARTMOUTH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip's appointment to be Se|cretary of State for the American depart|ment, by numbers that re&s;pected your Lord&s;hip's religious character, was looked upon as a very providential and happy event. Your patronizing of religious undertakings, confirmed the general opinion, and we were happy in the expectations of your Lord&s;hip's con&s;cientious regard to ju&s;tice and equity, as well as to the civil and religious liberties of this great Continent; we expected the cau&s;e of liberty and religion would meet with the &s;tronge&s;t &s;upport under your admini&s;tration, and in your Lord&s;hip would ever find a con&s;tant and &s;ucce&s;sful advocate with your royal ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="IV" REF="014636_0003_0F9437EA2D5944A8">Unhappily during your admini&s;tration, mea|&s;ures have been pur&s;ued very contrary to Ame|rican hopes, and we ea&s;ily conceive your Lord|&s;hip may think it not le&s;s &s;trange that many friends of religion in America &s;hould be &s;o un|ea&s;y under laws which had your Lord&s;hip's con|currence and approbation.</P>
<P>It is to the Man and to the Chri&s;tian I wi&s;h to be permitted to addre&s;s my&s;elf: Your Lord|&s;hip ranks among the highe&s;t &s;ubjects, and has a large &s;hare in all public mea&s;ures, but anxiety for what may di&s;tre&s;s, and zeal for the welfare of the empire, can be no crime even in the meane&s;t; and when a hou&s;e is once in flames, every man is inexcu&s;able, or mu&s;t at lea&s;t be &s;o in his own brea&s;t, that does not contribute what|ever he may think in his power to their being extingui&s;hed. The effects of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures are vi&s;ible, and it requires no &s;agacity to fore&s;ee what may be the con&s;equence, &s;hould they be continued. Your Lord&s;hip may do much to|wards re&s;toring and perpetuating the tranquility of a great empire; per&s;ons of my &s;tation have nothing to offer but hints and wi&s;hes, &s;hould the&s;e be beneath your notice, or &s;tand in need of forgivene&s;s, my &s;incere wi&s;h to contribute any

thing towards a ju&s;t, happy and perpetual con|nexion between a parent &s;tate and an infant country growing apace to the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing importance, mu&s;t be my only apology. <HI>Pulchrum e&s;t bene facere reipublicae, &s;ed &amp; bene dicere non e&s;t ab&s;urdum.</HI></P>
<P>The que&s;tion, My Lord, which now agitates Great-Britain and America, and in which your Lord&s;hip has taken &s;uch an active part, is, whether the Parliament of Great-Britain has a right to lay taxes on the Americans, who are not, and cannot, there be repre&s;ented, and whether the Parliament has a right to bind the Americans in all ca&s;es what&s;oever? Whatever may be &s;aid, or whatever the good people in Great-Britain may believe, this is the whole &s;ubject of the di&s;pute. All the &s;everities hither|to exerci&s;ed upon the Americans profe&s;&s;edly have no other view than to enforce &s;uch a dependance, and nothing le&s;s than a claim de&s;tructive of all natural and national liberty, could po&s;&s;ibly have united all America in a general oppo&s;ition, or have arou&s;ed them to join all like one man in their common defence. Let a declaratory bill be pa&s;&s;ed, that any law and u&s;age to the contrary notwith&s;tanding, America is entitled to all the
<PB N="VI" REF="014636_0005_0F9437EBB2B96D88">
common rights of mankind and all the ble&s;&s;ings of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, that the &s;word &s;hall never be drawn to abridge, but to confirm, her birthright, and the &s;torm in&s;tantly becomes a calm, and every American thinks him&s;elf happy to contribute to the nece&s;&s;ities, defence and glory of Great-Britain to the utmo&s;t of his &s;trength and power.</P>
<P><HI>To bind them in</HI> ALL CASES WHATSOEVER, my Lord, the Americans look upon this as the language of de&s;poti&s;m in its utmo&s;t perfection. What can, &s;ay they, an Emperor of Morocco pre|tend more of his &s;laves than to bind them in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. Were it meant to make the Americans hewers of wood and drawers of water, were it meant to oblige them to make bricks with|out &s;traw, were it meant to deprive them of the enjoyment of their religion, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a hie|rarchy over them &s;imilar to that of the church of Rome in Canada? it would, &s;ay they, be no more than a natural con&s;equence of the right of binding them (un&s;een, unheard, unrepre&s;ented) in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>My Lord, the Americans are no ideots, and they appear determined not to be &s;laves. Op|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="VII" REF="014636_0006_0F9437ECBACC3348">
will make wi&s;e men mad, but oppre&s;&s;ors in the end frequently find that they were not wi&s;e men: there may be re&s;ources even in de&s;pair &s;ufficient to render any &s;et of men &s;trong enough not to be bound in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Grievous is the thought, my Lord, that a no|bleman of your Lord&s;hip's character &s;hould be &s;o zealous to make war, and to imbrue his hands in the blood of millions of your fellow-&s;ubjects and fellow-chri&s;tians: Pray, my Lord, is it po&s;&s;ible that tho&s;e, who at three thou&s;and miles di&s;tance can be bound in all ca&s;es, may be &s;aid to have any liberty at all? Is it nothing in your Lord&s;hip's eye to deprive &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the globe of the privilege of breathing a free air, or to &s;ub|jugate numbers and generations to &s;lavery and de&s;poti&s;m? Can your Lord&s;hip think on the&s;e things without horror, or hope they mu&s;t be productive of any thing but dete&s;tation and di&s;|appointment? Your Lord&s;hip believes a Supreme Ruler of the earth, and that the &s;mall and great mu&s;t &s;tand before him at la&s;t: Would your Lord&s;hip be willing, at the general meeting of all mankind, to take a place among tho&s;e who de&s;troyed or en&s;laved empires, or ri&s;k your future &s;tate on the merit of having, at the expence of
<PB N="VIII" REF="014636_0007_0F9437ED2C74FF28">
Briti&s;h blood and trea&s;ure, taken away the pro|perty, the life and liberty of the large&s;t part of the Britti&s;h empire? Can your Lord&s;hip think tho&s;e that fear the LORD will not cry to him again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, and will not the Father of mankind hear the cries of the oppre&s;&s;ed? or would you be willing that their cries and tears &s;hould ri&s;e again&s;t you as a forward in&s;trument of their oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I know, my Lord, that this is not courtly language, but your Lord&s;hip is a profe&s;&s;or of re|ligion, and of the pure, gentle, benevolent re|ligion of JESUS CHRIST: The groans of a people pu&s;hed on a precipice, and driven on the very brink of de&s;pair, will prove forcible, till it can be proved that any power, in who&s;e legi&s;lation the Americans have no part, may at plea&s;ure bind them in all ca&s;es what&s;oever; till it can be proved that &s;uch a claim does not con&s;ti|tute the very e&s;&s;ence of &s;lavery and de&s;poti&s;m; till it can be proved that the Americans (whom in this view I can no longer call Britons) may, and of right ought, to be thus bound; abhor|rence of &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions is only the language of truth, which in the end will force its way, and
<PB N="IX" REF="014636_0008_0F9437F08A72ED40">
ri&s;e &s;uperior to all the arts of fal&s;hood and all the powers of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Right or wrong, my Lord, in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever, but more e&s;pecially when the fate of na|tions is concerned, are words of infinite moment. Your Lord&s;hip doubtle&s;s believes that the weighty alternative mu&s;t have very &s;olemn and different effects here and hereafter; but waving the right or wrong of this vile unhappy di&s;pute, let me entreat your Lord&s;hip's attention to con&s;ider at what an infinite ri&s;k the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures mu&s;t be pur&s;ued, even were it not demon&s;trable that they are in the highe&s;t degree wrong, cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>The bulk of the inhabitants of a continent extending eighteen hundred miles in front on the atlantic, and permitting an exten&s;ion in breadth as far as the &s;outh &s;ea, look upon the claim, to bind them in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, as unju&s;t, illegal and dete&s;table, let us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment that they are gro&s;sly mi&s;taken; yet an error imbibed by millions, and in which they believe the ALL of the pre&s;ent and future gene|rations lies at &s;take, may prove a very dangerous error; de&s;troying the Americans will not cure
<PB N="X" REF="014636_0009_0F9437F18A8089A0">
them, nor will any acts that condemn to &s;tarve or be mi&s;erable, have any tendency to per&s;uade them that the&s;e acts were made by their friends. The people in England are made to believe that the Americans want to &s;eparate from them, or are unwilling to bear their part of the common burden. No repre&s;entation can be more fal&s;e; but, my Lord, a nation cannot be mi&s;led always, and when once the good people of Great-Britain get truer notions of the matter, they will naturally wreak their re&s;entment on tho&s;e by whom they have been gro&s;sly mi&s;informed or wretchedly deceived.</P>
<P>Review, my Lord, the effects of the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures; the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent will inform your Lord&s;hip of what may be to come.</P>
<P>With an unparalleled patience did the Bo|&s;tonians bear the annihilation of their trade, the blocking up of their harbour, and many other di&s;tre&s;&s;es, till at Lexington an attack was made upon their lives, and then they gave &s;ufficient proof that their patience was not the effect of timidity, but of prudence and an unwillingne&s;s to &s;hed Briti&s;h blood. This attack convinced all America <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="XI" REF="014636_0010_0F9437F39B9B6DB8">
were athir&s;t after their blood, and the behaviour of both parties on that day, and in many little &s;kirmi&s;hes &s;ince, mu&s;t convince all the world that in the cau&s;e of liberty the Americans are not afraid to look regulars in the face, and that in an unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;ervice Briti&s;h troops are far from being invincible.</P>
<P>The burning of the innocent town of Charles|town, after it had been left by its inhabitants, is a piece of &s;uch wanton cruelty as will fix an overla&s;ting di&s;grace on the Briti&s;h arms. In the long civil war in Great-Britain nothing of the kind was attempted by either party, and this barbarity cannot fail being condemned by all ci|vilized nations.</P>
<P>If at the battle on Bunker's hill the Ameri|cans have been &s;urprized, &s;uperiority has co&s;t the regulars dearer than the Americans what is called their defeat, one or two more &s;uch defeats of the Americans would forever put it out of the power of the pre&s;ent regular army to gain a victory.</P>
<P>The rejecting of the New-York petition has
<PB N="XII" REF="014636_0011_0F9437F3F21D0678">
effectually &s;ilenced all tho&s;e who pleaded for, or hoped any good from, petitioning. The can|nonading of that town in the dead of the night, and without the lea&s;t previous warning, as it has &s;hewn what the inhabitants are indi&s;criminately to expect, will in hi&s;tory &s;tand as a la&s;ting mo|nument of &s;uch wantonne&s;s of cruelty as nations not remarkable for humanity would be a&s;hamed of.</P>
<P>The de&s;troying of the New-England fi&s;hery laid all tho&s;e who were deprived of their bread and occupation at &s;ea, under an ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;eeking it in the American army, and the &s;en&s;e of the injury done them will doubtle&s;s exert it&s;elf in the day of battle.</P>
<P>The endeavour to &s;tir up popi&s;h Canadians and &s;avage Indians again&s;t the Coloni&s;ts has been productive of the taking of the important pa&s;s of Ticonderoga, which has been effected with|out the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle life on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>Detaining the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, after they had, in dependance on the General's word of honour, given up their arms, to be &s;tarved
<PB N="XIII" REF="014636_0012_0F9437F4B4DF81D8">
and ruined, is an action worthy of the cau&s;e, and can only be equaled by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Pro|te&s;tants driven under the walls of Londonderry, at which even a James relented.</P>
<P>Propo&s;als publicly made by mini&s;terial writers relative to American dome&s;tics, laid the &s;outh|ern provinces under a nece&s;&s;ity of arming them|&s;elves; a propo&s;al to put it in the power of do|me&s;tics to cut the throats of their ma&s;ters, can only &s;erve to cover the propo&s;ers and abettors with everla&s;ting infamy.</P>
<P>The Americans have been called
<Q>a rope of &s;and;</Q>
but blood and &s;and will make a firm cementation, and enough American blood has been already &s;hed to cement them together into a thirteenfold cord, not ea&s;ily to be broken.</P>
<P>My Lord, the violence of the pre&s;ent mea|&s;ures has almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly created a conti|nental union, a continental currency, a conti|nental army, and before this can reach your Lord&s;hip, they will be as equal in di&s;cipline as they are &s;uperior in cau&s;e and &s;pirit to any regu|lars. The mo&s;t zealous Americans could not
<PB N="XIV" REF="014636_0013_0F9437F56F801090">
have effected in an age, what the cruelty and violence of admini&s;tration has effectually brought to pa&s;s in a day.</P>
<P>The regular army employed on this errand, with four able generals, now lies no better than be&s;ieged within the ruins of Charlestown and Bo&s;ton, unable to procure the nece&s;&s;aries of life, obliged to import their bread from Europe, and fuel from Canada, pining away with di&s;ea&s;e, and affording daily martyrs to cruelty and arbi|trary power, while every day adds to the impro|bability of their ever obtaining tho&s;e unhappy ends, A &s;trange &s;ituation for a Briti&s;h army!</P>
<P>Re&s;training the trade of the Colonies, will ef|fectually annihilate all their trade with Great-Britain. The numbers that cro&s;&s;ed the atlantic, or re-exported American commodities from Great-Britain, the manufacturers that wrought for America, or worked up her raw materials, will now be at full lei&s;ure to know and feel whether the American trade be an object of any importance, and how much the nation is obliged to a mini&s;try that has &s;o effectually laboured its de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="XV" REF="014636_0014_0F9437F6366F6108">The pre&s;ent di&s;pute has made every Ameri|can acquainted with, and attentive to, the prin|ciples of the Britti&s;h con&s;titution: In this re|&s;pect, as well as in a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of liberty, and the u&s;e of fire-arms almo&s;t from the cradle, the Americans have va&s;tly the advantage over men of their rank almo&s;t every where el&s;e. From the con|&s;tant topic of pre&s;ent conver&s;ation, every child unborn will be impre&s;&s;ed with the notion: It is &s;lavery to be bound at the will of another in all ca&s;es what&s;oever; every mother's milk will convey a dete&s;tation of this maxim. Were your Lord&s;hip in America, you might &s;ee little ones acquainted with the word of command before they can di|&s;tinctly &s;peak, and &s;houldering the re&s;emblance of a gun before they are well able to walk.</P>
<P>When millions of free people at once turn their thoughts from trade, and the means of ac|quiring wealth, to agriculture and frugality, it mu&s;t cau&s;e a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible alteration in the &s;tate. My Lord, this is the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent in America; every new act of violence will &s;trengthen and confirm the &s;pirit that taught them the nece&s;&s;ity of being frugal and virtuous, that they might remain free, and become invincible.</P>
<P><PB N="XVI" REF="014636_0015_0F9437F71A2E6098">Admit, my Lord, (for &s;uppo&s;itions now be|come probable in proportion of their being a&s;toni&s;hing and violent) that a Britti&s;h fleet may effectually guard every harbour, river, creek or inlet on the American coa&s;t; admit al&s;o that her troops de&s;troy every town, village or hut along the &s;ea&s;hore, what then will be the con&s;equence? Why, my Lord, it will be the de&s;troying the property of thou&s;ands in Great-Britain, and of a few on this &s;ide of the water, whom your Lord|&s;hip calls your friends; perhaps the attempt may not &s;ucceed, but &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould, the Ame|ricans, injured beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of reparation, and irritated to the highe&s;t degree, will retire where they are inacce&s;&s;ible to troops and &s;hips; in&s;tead of trade and navigation, you will have a de&s;olate &s;ea-coa&s;t, the trade of America will be lo&s;t, and with it the &s;inews of war: And, my Lord, in the natural cour&s;e of things America, in le&s;s than half a century, will contain more inhabitants than Great-Britain and Ireland; and that period, my Lord, is not &s;o far di&s;tant, to put the pre&s;ent treatment entirely out of re|membrance. America and Great-Britain joined in arms together, may grow confident again&s;t the world be&s;ides; but if Britain continue her
<PB N="XVII" REF="014636_0016_0F9437F99FF92E40">
arms again&s;t America; if her troops can be per|&s;uaded to go on again&s;t their brethren and friends, if they will de&s;troy the la&s;t a&s;ylum of liberty, and a country which has &s;aved &s;o many thou|&s;ands from &s;tarving at home, the Americans will fight like men, who have every thing at &s;take; the mercenaries with bayonets at their backs, and at the rate of &s;ix-pence a day; if they are once defeated, whence will they be re&s;upplied; if they return to Britain victorious, they will be fit in&s;truments to promote that &s;lavery at home which they have been &s;ucce&s;sful in fa&s;tening (probably for a very little while) on their fellow-&s;ubjects abroad.</P>
<P>In times of public confu&s;ion men of all par|ties are &s;ometimes carried further than they in|tended at fir&s;t &s;etting out. Hi&s;tory and the know|ledge of human nature &s;hould inform your Lord|&s;hip how much it is again&s;t all &s;ound policy to &s;ecure or &s;trive for punctilios at an infinite ri&s;k.</P>
<P>The Americans have always &s;hewn an af|fectionate regard to the king, and they are truly &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity and advantage of a per|petual union with the parent &s;tate; but unde|&s;erved
<PB N="XVIII" REF="014636_0017_0F9437F9C1B74CF0">
&s;everities cannot be productive of any plea&s;ing returns. The Americans firmly believe that the claim at pre&s;ent endeavouring to be en|forced, would render them mere &s;laves, and it is their general motto, "DEATH OR FREEDOM." The parliamentary, or, as they &s;ay, mini&s;terial, claim is now written in letters of blood, and that will be far from making it more acceptable to American readers.</P>
<P>On the whole, my Lord, &s;hould this addre&s;s be deemed impertinent and intru&s;ive, I hope it may &s;till be excu&s;able from the importance of the cau&s;e, and the &s;incerity of its motive. In the event of the pre&s;ent di&s;pute I look upon all man|kind as intere&s;ted, and though not natural born, his Maje&s;ty has not another &s;ubject that more ardently wi&s;heth that his own repo&s;e and happi|ne&s;s and that of all his &s;ubjects may never meet with any interruption. Whether Briti&s;h troops &s;hall now drive liberty from out of the greater part of the Briti&s;h empire, and bury her remains in the American wilderne&s;s, or whether that wilderne&s;s &s;hall flouri&s;h and chearfully contribute to make Great-Britain the greate&s;t empire of the univer&s;e, is the que&s;tion now to be decided, and
<PB N="XIX" REF="014636_0018_0F9437FA299C9E50">
it is not &s;o unimportant, but it may be expected HE that is higher than the highe&s;t, and taketh up the i&s;les like a very little thing, will interpo&s;e in the deci&s;ion. The whole American proce&s;s, my Lord, is liable to a revi&s;ion, and when righteou&s;|ne&s;s and judgment to come once make an im|pre&s;&s;ion, many a Felix will tremble.</P>
<P>To re&s;tore peace and harmony nothing is ne|ce&s;&s;ary than to &s;ecure to America the known ble&s;&s;ings of the Britti&s;h con&s;titution. This may be done in a moment, and without any di&s;grace or ri&s;k. Let the Americans enjoy, as hitherto, the privilege to GIVE and GRANT by their own repre&s;entatives, and they will give and grant li|berally; but their liberty they will never part with but with their lives. The day that re&s;tores their liberty, re&s;tores every thing to the former channel; to enforce the contrary claim, ages may be in&s;ufficient, and every day encrea&s;es the danger of

<P>That your Lord&s;hip, in the hand of Provi|dence, may be a happy in&s;trument to bring the pre&s;ent unnatural conte&s;t to a &s;peedy, ju&s;t and

<P>THERE was a time when there was no king in I&s;rael, and every man did what was good in his own eyes. The con&s;equence was a civil war in the nation, i&s;&s;uing in the ruin of one of the tribes, and a con&s;iderable lo&s;s to all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>And there was a time when there was a king in I&s;rael, and he al&s;o did what was right in his own eyes, a fooli&s;h &s;on of a wi&s;e father; his own imprudence, the ra&s;hne&s;s of his young coun&s;ellors, his unwillingne&s;s to redre&s;s the grievances of the nation, and the har&s;h treatment he gave to tho&s;e who applied for relief, al&s;o brought on a civil war, and i&s;&s;ued in the &s;eparation of the ten tribes from the hou&s;e of David. He &s;ent his trea&s;urer to gather an odious duty or tribute, but the children of I&s;rael &s;toned him that he died; and when he gathered one hundred and four &s;core thou&s;and men, that he might bring again the kingdom unto Roboam, GOD &s;ent them a me&s;&s;age, "ye &s;hall not go up, nor &s;ight again&s;t your brethren, return every man to his hou&s;e, for this thing is done of me." GOD di&s;approved of the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures and mini&s;try of Roboam, and that

king's army appears more ready to obey the command of their GOD, than &s;lay their brethren by orders of a tyrant.
<Q>They obeyed the voice of the LORD, and returned from going again&s;t Jeroboam.</Q>
2 Chron. x:18.xi:4.</P>
<P>The things that happened before are written for our learning. By comparing pa&s;t times and proceed|ings with the&s;e that are pre&s;ent, prudence will point out many &s;alutary and religious le&s;&s;ons. The conduct of Roboam verifies the lamentation of his father, "Woe to thee, o land, when thy king is a child." Eccle&s;. x:16. A very &s;mall degree of ju&s;tice and mo|deration might have pre&s;erved his kingdom, but he thought weapons of war better than wi&s;dom; he hearkened not, neither to the people, nor to &s;ome of his more faithful coun&s;ellors, and the con&s;equence was that, in&s;tead of en&s;laving the ten tribes who &s;tood up for their liberty, GOD gave Judah to be &s;ervants to the king of Egypt, that they might learn the difference between his &s;ervice and the &s;ervice of the kingdoms of the nations. A people that claim no more than their natural rights, in &s;o doing, do nothing di&s;plea&s;ing un|to GOD; and the mo&s;t powerful monarch that would deprive his &s;ubjects of the liberties of man, whatever may be his &s;ucce&s;s, he mu&s;t not expect the approba|tion of GOD, and in due time will be the abhorrence of all men.</P>
<P>In a time of public and general unea&s;ine&s;s it behoves both &s;uperiors and inferiors to con&s;ider. It is ea&s;y to extingui&s;h a &s;park, it is folly to blow up di&s;content into a blaze; the beginning of &s;trife is like the letting out of waters, and no man may know where it will end. There is a rule given to magi&s;trates and &s;ubjects; which, if carefully attended to, would &s;ecure the dignity and &s;afety of both; which, if not duly regarded, is u&s;ually

attended with the wor&s;t con&s;equences. The pre&s;ent, my hearers, will ea&s;ily be allowed is a day of trouble, and &s;urely in this day of adver&s;ity we ought to con&s;ider. When a people think them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed, and in danger, nothing can be more natural than that they &s;hould enquire into the real &s;tate of things, trace their grievances to their &s;ource, and endeavour to apply the remedies which are mo&s;t likely to procure relief: This I take to be the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent meeting of per|&s;ons deputed from every part of the country; and as they have thought proper to open and begin their de|liberations with a &s;olemn addre&s;s unto GOD, and the con&s;ideration of his holy word, I mo&s;t chearfully com|ply with their reque&s;t to officiate on this occa&s;ion, and &s;hall endeavour, as I may be enabled, to point out &s;uch directions from the holy &s;criptures as may make us wi&s;e in the knowledge of time, and direct us how to carry our&s;elves worthy of the character of good &s;ubjects and Chri&s;tians: Whatever may be nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, I take to be comprehended in the apo&s;tolical rule, which I have laid down as the &s;ubject of this di&s;|cour&s;e,
<Q>So &s;peak, and &s;o do, as they that &s;hall be judged by the law of liberty.</Q></P>
<P>There are two things which properly come before us, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That we are to be judged by the law of liberty; and</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The exhortation to act worthy, and under the in|fluence, of this important truth on every occa&s;ion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>A law is a rule of behaviour, made under proper authority, and with penalties annexed, &s;uitable to de|ter the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. As all laws &s;uppo&s;e man to be in a &s;ocial &s;tate, &s;o all laws ought to be made for the good of man: A law that is not made by &s;uch as have
<PB N="4" REF="014636_0023_0F9437FFF4E70B88">
authority for &s;o doing, is of no force; and if authority makes laws de&s;tructive in them&s;elves, no authority can prevent things from finally taking their natural cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Wherever there is &s;ociety, there mu&s;t al&s;o be law; it is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;ociety &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. The will, minds, tempers, di&s;po&s;itions, views and in|tere&s;ts of men are &s;o very different, and &s;ometimes &s;o oppo&s;ite, that without law, which cements and binds all, every thing would be in endle&s;s di&s;order and con|fu&s;ion. All laws u&s;ually wear the complexion of tho&s;e by whom they were made, but it cannot be denied that &s;ome bad men, from a &s;en&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, have made good laws, and that &s;ome good men, from mi&s;take, or other weakne&s;&s;es, have enacted laws bad in them&s;elves, and pernicious in their con&s;equences.</P>
<P>All human laws partake of human imperfection; it is not &s;o with the laws of GOD. He is perfect, and &s;o are all his works and ways.
<Q>The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the &s;oul. The te&s;timony of the LORD is &s;ure, making wi&s;e the &s;imple. The &s;tatutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlighten|ing the eyes. All his judgments are truth, and righteou&s;ne&s;s altogether.</Q>
P&s;alm xix.</P>
<P>Among men every &s;ociety and country has its own laws and form of government, which may be very dif|ferent, and cannot operate beyond their limits; but tho&s;e laws and that form of government is undoubtedly be&s;t which has the greate&s;t tendency to make all tho&s;e that live under it &s;ecure and happy. As &s;oon as we con|&s;ider man as formed into &s;ociety, it is evident that the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salus populi &s;uprema lex.</NOTE> &s;afety of the whole mu&s;t be the grand law which mu&s;t in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ence and direct every other: Men did not pa&s;s from a &s;tate of nature into a &s;tate of &s;ociety, to render
<PB N="5" REF="014636_0024_0F94380229D146C8">
their &s;ituation more mi&s;erable, and their rights more precarious That government and tyranny is the here|ditary right of &s;ome, and that &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion is the original doom of others, is a doctrine that would reflect di&s;honour upon GOD; it is trea&s;on again&s;t all mankind, it is indeed an enormous faith that millions were made for one; tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is but a harmle&s;s ab&s;urdity, compared with the notion of a divine right to govern wrong, or of making laws which are con|trary to every idea of liberty, property and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The law which the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of in our text, is not a law of man, but of Him who is the only lawgiver, that can &s;ave and condemn, to whom all owe obedience, and who&s;e laws none can tran&s;gre&s;s with impunity.</P>
<P>Though all the laws that GOD ever gave unto man are worthy of GOD, and tend to promote the happi|ne&s;s of tho&s;e to whom they were given, yet we may ob&s;erve a very &s;triking variety in the different laws which he gave at different times and to different people.
<Q>He &s;hewed his word unto Jacob, his &s;tatutes and his judgments unto I&s;rael; he has not dealt &s;o with any other nation.</Q>
P&s;alm cxlvii:18.19.</P>
<P>To the generality of mankind he gave no written law, but yet left not him&s;elf without a witne&s;s among them; the words of the law were written in their hearts, their con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while excu&s;ing or el&s;e accu&s;ing one another: It cannot be &s;aid they were without law, whil&s;t what they were to do, and what they were to forbear, was written in their hearts.</P>
<P>To I&s;rael GOD came with a fiery law in his hands, it was given with the mo&s;t awful &s;olemnity upon mount Sinai; and as the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of all their cere|monial, political and moral law centered in the ten commandments, &s;o the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e is
<PB N="6" REF="014636_0025_0F9438024C152B90">
comprehended in love to GOD and love to man, which, as our LORD him&s;elf informs us, contains all the law and all the prophets.</P>
<P>All manife&s;tations of the will of GOD have been gradual, and it is probable the means of knowing GOD will be progre&s;&s;ive through different ages, till eternity gives the good man a full &s;ight of GOD in his imme|diate pre&s;ence. During the di&s;pen&s;ation of the old te|&s;tament and the ceremonial law, a &s;pirit of bondage obtained unto fear, the law was a &s;choolma&s;ter to bring us unto CHRIST; neither did the law make any thing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope: Grace and truth was brought to light by JESUS CHRIST, and hence the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, under which we live, is called the law of LIBERTY.</P>
<P>Though there is a manife&s;t di&s;tinction between law and go&s;pel, and &s;ometimes the&s;e two things are even oppo&s;ed to one another, yet the doctrine of the go&s;pel is al&s;o called "the law of faith;" Rom. iii:17. partly becau&s;e it was u&s;ual with the Jewi&s;h writers to call every doctrine a law, and partly al&s;o becau&s;e the doctrine of the go&s;pel pre&s;ents us with a rule of life, which all its profe&s;&s;ors are bound to obey; hence they are &s;aid to be "not without law, but under the law of CHRIST;" 1 Cor. ix:11. and hence our apo&s;tle &s;peaks of a royal law, which, though we cannot obey in perfection, nor derive any merit from our imperfect obedience, we can|not neglect without danger, nor di&s;obey without &s;hewing our di&s;regard to the doctrine of the go&s;pel in general.</P>
<P>It de&s;erves very particular attention that the doctrine of the go&s;pel is called a law of LIBERTY. Liberty and law are perfectly con&s;i&s;tent; liberty does not con&s;i&s;t in living without all re&s;traint; for were all men to live without re&s;traint, as they plea&s;e, there would &s;oon be no liberty at all; the &s;tronge&s;t would be ma&s;ter, the

weake&s;t go to the wall; right, ju&s;tice and property mu&s;t give way to power, and, in&s;tead of its being a ble&s;&s;ing, a more unhappy &s;ituation could not ea&s;ily be devi&s;ed unto mankind than that every man &s;hould have it in his power to do what is right in his own eyes: well regulated liberty of individuals is the na|tural off&s;pring of laws, which prudentially regulate the rights of whole communities; and as laws which take away the natural rights of men, are unju&s;t and oppre&s;|&s;ive, &s;o all liberty which is not regulated by law, is a delu&s;ive phantom, and unworthy of the glorious name.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel is called a law of liberty, becau&s;e it bears a mo&s;t friendly a&s;pect to the liberty of man; it is a known rule, <HI>Evangelium non tollit politias,</HI> the go&s;pel makes no alteration in the civil &s;tate; it by no means renders man's natural and &s;ocial condition wor&s;e than it would be without the knowledge of the go&s;pel. When the Jews boa&s;ted of their freedom, and that they never were in bondage, our LORD does not reprove them for it, but only ob&s;erves, that national freedom &s;till admits of improvement:
<Q>If the Son &s;hall make you free, then are you free indeed.</Q>
John vi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">:16. This leads me to ob&s;erve that the go&s;pel is a law of liberty in a much higher &s;en&s;e: By whom&s;oever a man is overcome, of the &s;ame he is brought into bondage; but no external enemy can &s;o completely tyrannize over a conquered enemy, as &s;in does over all tho&s;e who yield them&s;elves its &s;ervants; vicious habits, when once they have gained the a&s;cendant in the &s;oul, bring man to that unhappy pa&s;s that he knows better things and does wor&s;e; &s;in, like a torrent, carries him away again&s;t knowledge and conviction, while con&s;cience fully con|vince him that he travels the road of death, and mu&s;t expect, if he &s;o continues, to take up his abode in hell; though his decaying body clearly tells him &s;in breaks
<PB N="8" REF="014636_0027_0F943804E78AE108">
his con&s;titution, as well as wa&s;tes his &s;ub&s;tance, though he feels the lo&s;s of credit and wealth, &s;till &s;in has too &s;trong a hold of him to be for&s;aken, though he faintly re&s;olves to break off, yet, till the grace of GOD brings &s;alvation, when he would do good, evil is pre&s;ent with him; in &s;hort, in&s;tead of being under a law of liberty, he is under the law of &s;in and death, but whenever he feels the happy influence of the grace of the go&s;pel, then this
<Q>law of liberty makes him free from the law of &s;in and death;</Q>
Rom. viii:2. it furni&s;heth him not only with motives to re&s;i&s;t but with power al&s;o to &s;ubdue &s;in; &s;in reigns no longer in his mortal body, becau&s;e he is not under the law, but under grace. By this law of liberty he is made free from &s;in, and has his fruit unto holine&s;s, and the end of it eternal life. There is another rea&s;on why the go&s;pel is called a law of liberty, which is to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the ceremo|nial law under the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation; a yoke, of which an apo&s;tle &s;aith, neither they nor their fathers were able to bear; it was &s;uperadded on account of their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and &s;uited to the character of a gro&s;s and &s;tubborn nation, to whom it was originally given; they were &s;o prone to idolatry, and &s;o apt to forget their GOD, their notions were &s;o gro&s;s and car|nal, that a number of external rites and ceremonies be|came nece&s;&s;ary, to put them in mind of him, and to attach them to &s;ome degree of his wor&s;hip and &s;ervice. This, however nece&s;&s;ary, was a heavy burden; it bid them "touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not;" it required of them expen&s;ive &s;acrifices, and a co&s;tly and painful &s;ervice; it was attended with the mo&s;t fearful threat|nings, if any man brake Mo&s;es law, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> under two or three witne&s;&s;es; and the very &s;pirit they then received, was a &s;pirit of bondage unto fear: Whereas the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a &s;pirit of confidence,
<PB N="9" REF="014636_0028_0F9438055A849EB8">
and under the law of liberty we call upon GOD as Abba Father. By this law of liberty the profe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel will be judged.</P>
<P>Every man is a rational, and therefore accountable, creature. As a creature he mu&s;t needs depend on his Creator, and as a rational creature he mu&s;t certainly be accountable for all his actions. Nothing is more evident than that man is not of him&s;elf; and if once we admit that he holds his exi&s;tence, his faculties and favours from GOD, that made him, it becomes a very obvious conclu&s;ion, that his Maker mu&s;t have had &s;ome view in giving him exi&s;tence, and more under&s;tanding than to the bea&s;ts of the field, neither can it be a mat|ter of indifference to him whether man acts agreeably or contrary to his de&s;igns. The Creator of the natural world, is al&s;o its moral ruler; and if he is now the proprietor and ruler of intelligent beings, at &s;ome time or other he mu&s;t al&s;o be their judge.</P>
<P>If GOD had not made his will known unto man, there could have been neither tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion nor judge|ment. If it &s;hould be &s;aid that GOD has not manife&s;ted him&s;elf alike unto all men, and that &s;ome have much &s;maller opportunities to know his will and their duty than others, it is enough to ob&s;erve, that no man will be judged by a rule of which it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have any knowledge. Every work and every man will be brought into judgment, and the judgment of GOD will never be otherwi&s;e than according to truth; but tho&s;e that never had the law of liberty, will not be judged by that law, and tho&s;e that have been favoured with the revelation of the go&s;pel will be more inex|cu&s;able than any others, if they neglect the day of their vi&s;itation.
<Q>As many as have &s;inned without law, &s;hall al&s;o peri&s;h without law, and as many as have &s;inned in the law, &s;hall be judged by the law.</Q> Rom. ii:12.

<P>The general character, all the thoughts, words and actions, together with the general conduct of all tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed the go&s;pel, will be brought to the te&s;t, and tried by this rule.

<P>In the judgment, according to this law, our cha|racter, words, thoughts and actions will be brought to the te&s;t of this rule, our conduct will be compared with the&s;e precepts, this is the balance of the &s;anctuary, in which the profe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel &s;hall be weighed, and as they &s;hall be found approved or deficient, their ca&s;e mu&s;t be determined. Tho&s;e who&s;e temper and actions &s;hall be found conformable to the law of li|berty, will be acquitted, graciou&s;ly accepted, and made ever happy, and tho&s;e who turned the grace of GOD into wantonne&s;s, and made the liberty of the go&s;pel a cloak for their &s;ins, will be finally rejected. The go&s;pel informs us, that a day is already appointed for that purpo&s;e; it acquaints us with the per&s;on of our judge, and every circum&s;tance, as well as the rule according to which he will proceed in judgment. Perhaps on that day when all nations &s;hall appear before the judge, and he will divide them as a &s;hepherd divideth the &s;heep from the goats, di&s;tinct places will al&s;o be al|lotted to tho&s;e who are to be judged by natural con|&s;cience and the law of nature, and tho&s;e who have been favoured with a divine revelation, and e&s;pecially with the light of the go&s;pel: The people of Niniveh will ari&s;e again&s;t empty profe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel, and will condemn them.

<P>It de&s;erves our peculiar attention, that the apo&s;tle con&s;iders the go&s;pel as a law of liberty, at the &s;ame time when he &s;ets it before us as the rule by which we are to be judged.

As the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a law of liberty mu&s;t be more inexcu&s;able, than the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a law un|ju&s;t or oppre&s;&s;ive in it&s;elf, or even the ceremonial law, which was given only for a certain period, and to an&s;wer temporary purpo&s;es, &s;o their judgment and doom mu&s;t be proportionably heavier, who have &s;in|ned again&s;t love and liberty, as well as again&s;t power and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>According to this law the fate of men will not only be determined, but &s;entence will al&s;o be put into exe|cution. GOD &s;itteth on the throne of judgment every day, and judgeth righteou&s;ly, but he hath moreover appointed a particular day when he will manife&s;t his power and ju&s;tice before the whole creation; when the dead both &s;mall and great will &s;tand before GOD; when tho&s;e that acted agreeable to the law of liberty, will attain the fulne&s;s of glory of the freedom of the &s;ons of GOD, and when he will al&s;o take vengeance on all that have not known God, and have not obeyed his holy go&s;pel. This naturally leads to the &s;econd thing propo&s;ed, to take a nearer view of the importance of

On this principle the apo&s;tle builds the general exhortation, <Q>So &s;peak, and &s;o do, as they that &s;hall be judged by the law of liberty.</Q> This implies:</P>
<P N="1">1. Be thoroughly convinced of the certainty of a judg|ment to come, and that it extends to you, to all your thoughts, words and actions. There is not any truth of greater moment, nor perhaps more ea&s;ily forgotten. The belief or unbelief of this important doctrine mu&s;t have the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible effects. All the apo&s;tles fre|quently put their hearers in mind of a judgment to come; and there is not any truth more nece&s;&s;ary to be frequently inculcated and daily thought on, and wherever this truth is really believed and felt, it will have a con&s;tant and natural influence on the behaviour of tho&s;e who truly believe it.</P>
<P N="2">2. See to it that in judgment you may &s;tand. All men will be brought into judgment, but few will be able to &s;tand; none will be excu&s;ed, or be able to withdraw, and only tho&s;e who have acted worthily, will meet with the divine acceptance. The difference will be amazing and beyond all conception: An eternity of happine&s;s, which eye has not &s;een, ear has not heard, and which never entered into the heart of any man, lies on the
<PB N="14" REF="014636_0033_0F94380C8E9258C0">
one &s;ide, and de&s;pair, mi&s;ery and torment on the other. Tho&s;e that are able to &s;tand, will meet with the &s;miles and approbation of their judge, and to all the re&s;t the king will &s;ay,
<Q>The&s;e mine enemies that would not have me to bear rule over them, bring them here, and &s;lay them before mine eyes.</Q>
Tho&s;e that believe and are convinced of this awful alternative, &s;hould certainly make it their care that they may be able to &s;tand in judgment; neither &s;hould the per|&s;ua&s;ion of this only influence their conduct in general, but the&s;e words ought to be con&s;idered as a rule, which we ought to have con&s;tantly before our eyes in all our di&s;cour&s;es and every undertaking; we &s;hould ever
<Q>&s;o &s;peak, and &s;o act, as they that &s;hall be judged by the law of liberty.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall draw a few inferences, before I conclude with a more particular addre&s;s to the worthy Gentlemen at who&s;e reque&s;t I preach on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The go&s;pel is a law of Liberty.</HI></P>
<P>A late writer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a tract, entituled, "Chains of &s;lavery." Printed London. 1775.</NOTE> a&s;&s;erts,
<Q>Every religion counte|nances de&s;poti&s;m, but none &s;o much as the Chri&s;tian.</Q>
This is a very heavy charge again&s;t religion in gene|ral, but bears harde&s;t on the Chri&s;tian. Whether it proceeds from malice, ignorance, or mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, it is needle&s;s to determine, but if chri&s;tianity be a law of liberty, it mu&s;t be obvious how ill-grounded is &s;uch a charge again&s;t it. It cannot be denied but &s;ome Chri&s;tian writers have wrote again&s;t the rights of man|kind. All tho&s;e who &s;tand up for unlimited pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, may have given but too much cau&s;e for &s;uch &s;urmi&s;es and &s;u&s;picions; but the truth is, that both tho&s;e which make this charge, and tho&s;e who gave occa&s;ion for it, were alike ignorant of the &s;pirit and temper of Chri&s;tianity; and it may well
<PB N="15" REF="014636_0034_0F94380CB3CA2DC0">
be doubted whether the venders of &s;uch odious doctrines, who foi&s;ted tenets, &s;o abominable and in|jurious to mankind, into the &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tian re|ligion, have not done that holy religion greater hurt under the pretence of friend&s;hip and defence than its mo&s;t barefaced enemies by all their mo&s;t violent at|tacks. Some Chri&s;tian divines have taught the enor|mous faith, that millions were made for one, they have a&s;cribed a divine right to kings to govern wrong; but what then? Are &s;uch abominable doctrines any part of chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e the&s;e men &s;ay &s;o? does the go|&s;pel cea&s;e to be a law of liberty, becau&s;e &s;ome of its profe&s;&s;ors pervert it into an engine of tyranny, op|pre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ertion, that all religion countenances de&s;po|ti&s;m, and chri&s;tianity more than any other, is diame|trically oppo&s;ite to fact. Survey the globe, and you will find that liberty has taken its &s;eat only in Chri&s;ten|dom, and that the highe&s;t degree of freedom is pleaded for and enjoyed by &s;uch as make profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>There are but two religions, which are concerned in this charge; the Jewi&s;h and the Chri&s;tian. Natural religion writers of this kind I &s;uppo&s;e would not include in their charge; if they do, they &s;et all religion at variance with the rights of mankind, contrary to the &s;en&s;e of all nations, who are gererally agreed, that, ab&s;tractly of a world to come, religion is of real &s;ervice and nece&s;&s;ity to mankind, for their better govern|ment and order.</P>
<P>As to the Jewi&s;h religion, it &s;eems really &s;trange that any &s;hould charge it with favouring de&s;poti&s;m, when by one of its expre&s;s rites at certain times it pro|claimed
<Q>liberty throughout the land, to the inha|bitants thereof.</Q>
Levit. xxv:10. It required their
<PB N="16" REF="014636_0035_0F94380D6CAFBE38">
kings
<Q>not to be lifted up in their hearts above their brethren.</Q> Deut. xvii:20 And the whole &s;y&s;tem of that religion is &s;o replete with laws again&s;t inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, it pays &s;uch an extraordinary regard to property, and gives &s;uch &s;trict a charge to rule in ju&s;tice and the fear of GOD, and to con&s;ider tho&s;e, over whom they judge, as their brethren, even when di&s;pen&s;ing puni&s;hments, and forbids all exce&s;s in them, that it is really &s;urprizing any one acquainted with its precepts, &s;hould declare it favourable to de&s;poti&s;m or oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian religion, while it commands due re|&s;pect and obedience to &s;uperiors, no where requires a blind and unlimited obedience on the part of the &s;ub|jects; nor does it ve&s;t any ab&s;olute and arbitrary power in the rulers. It is an in&s;titution for the benefit, and not for the di&s;tre&s;s, of mankind. It preacheth not only "glory to GOD on high," but al&s;o
<Q>peace on earth, and good will among men.</Q></P>
<P>The go&s;pel gives no higher authority to magi&s;trates than to be
<Q>the mini&s;ters of GOD, for the good of the &s;ubject.</Q>
Rom. xiii. From whence it mu&s;t &s;urely follow, that their power is to edify, and not to de&s;troy: When they abu&s;e their authority, to di&s;tre&s;s and de|&s;troy their &s;ubjects, they de&s;erve not to be thought mini&s;ters of GOD for good; nor is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, when they act &s;o contrary to the nature of their office, that they act agreeable to the will of GOD, or in con|formity to the doctrine of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel recommends unto ma&s;ters to forbear threatnings, and to remember that they al&s;o have a ma&s;ter in heaven; it a&s;&s;ures them that the eye of GOD is equally upon the &s;ervant and the ma&s;ter, and that with GOD there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons: It commands ma&s;ters, from the mo&s;t &s;olemn con&s;iderations, to give
<PB N="17" REF="014636_0036_0F94380E2CB73C30">
unto &s;ervants that which is ju&s;t and equal; it &s;aith to the meane&s;t &s;lave:
<Q>Art thou called being a &s;ervant, care not for it, but if thou maye&s;t be made free, u&s;e it rather.</Q> 1 Cor. vii:21.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the go&s;pel has that regard to pro|perty, that it commands even &s;oldiers,
<Q>Do violence to no man, and be content with your wages:</Q>
Luke iii:14. &mdash; that a Paul &s;ent back a run-away &s;lave, though now converted, and belonging to his intimate friend, and at a time when he &s;eems to have &s;tood in real need of his &s;ervice, from a delicacy that he would do nothing without the owner's mind, le&s;s his benefit &s;hould ap|pear as if it were of nece&s;&s;ity, and not willingly. Phi|lem. 14. From the &s;ame &s;pirit of ju&s;tice a Zacheus, after his conver&s;ion, re&s;tored fourfold what before he had taken from any by fal&s;e accu&s;ation: Surely then the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel is very friendly to the rights and property of men.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel &s;ets con&s;cience above all human au|thority in matters of faith, and bids us to
<Q>&s;tand fa&s;t in that liberty wherewith the Son of GOD has made us free.</Q>
Gal. v:1. Freedom is the very &s;pirit and temper of the go&s;pel:
<Q>He that is called in the LORD being a &s;ervant, is the LORD's freeman. Ye are bought with a price, be ye not the &s;ervants of men.</Q>
1 Cor. vii:22 23. At the &s;ame time that it commands us to &s;ubmit to every ordinance of men, it al&s;o directs us to act
<Q>as free, and not u&s;ing liberty as a cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the &s;ervants of GOD.</Q>
1 Pet. iii:13-18.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e therefore that would &s;upport arbitrary power, and require an unlimited obedience, in vain look for precedents or precepts for &s;uch things in the go&s;pel, an in&s;titution equally tending to make men ju&s;t, free

<P N="2">2. <HI>The main de&s;ign of the go&s;pel is not to direct us in our external and civil affairs, but how we may at la&s;t &s;tand with comfort before</HI> GOD, <HI>the judge of all.</HI></P>
<P>Human prudence is to be our guide in the concerns of time; the go&s;pel makes us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, and points out the means to be pur&s;ued that it may be well with us in the world to come. As rational creatures we are to make u&s;e of our rea&s;on; as Chri&s;tians we are to repent and believe the go&s;pel. Motives of a worldly nature may very properly influence us in our worldly concern, we are created not only for eternity, but al&s;o for time: It is not at all improper for us to have a due regard for both. The go&s;pel will regulate our de&s;ires and re&s;train our pa&s;&s;ions as to earthly things, and will rai&s;e us at the &s;ame time above time and &s;en&s;e, to objects of a nature more worthy of our|&s;elves. A due regard for, and frequent meditation on, a judgment to come, will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t us in all our concerns; and this very con&s;ideration the go&s;pel holds out to us in the cleare&s;t manner. It not only affirms as a truth, what rea&s;on and con&s;cience might con&s;ider only as probable, but it takes away as it were the veil from between us and things to come; it gives us a pre&s;ent view of the future bli&s;s of &s;aints, and the terrors and de&s;pair of &s;inners; &mdash; rather a hi&s;to|rical account than a prophetic de&s;cription of all the proceedings of the dreadful plea&s;ing day; it clearly points our the road to de&s;truction, and the way to e&s;cape; it affords us a plain and general rule to obtain &s;afety and comfort, when it bids us,
<Q>So &s;peak, and &s;o do, as they that &s;hall be judged by the law of liberty.</Q></P>
<P>This general rule may al&s;o be of con&s;iderable &s;ervice
<PB N="19" REF="014636_0038_0F9438120F73A0A0">
in extraordinary and particular ca&s;es. It is impo&s;&s;ible to provide expre&s;s directions for every particular ca&s;e, and in the cour&s;e of things circum&s;tances may happen when a good man may be at a lo&s;s to know his duty, and find it difficult &s;o to act as to obtain his own ap|probation. There may be danger of going beyond, and danger in not coming up to, the mark. To act worthy of GOD, who has called us, is the general rule of the Chri&s;tian at all times, and upon every occa&s;ion, and did we but always follow this rule, what manner of per&s;ons &s;hould we then be! But in ca&s;es of intricacy we may &s;till be in doubt what may be mo&s;t for the glory of GOD, and mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with our duty. Some|times al&s;o our relative duties may &s;eem to come in competition with one another, and we may he&s;itate in our own mind which for the pre&s;ent has the &s;tronge&s;t call. We would fain obey our &s;uperiors, and yet we cannot think of giving up our natural, our civil and religious rights, nor acquie&s;ce in or contribute to render our fellow-creatures or fellow-citizens &s;laves and mi|&s;erable. We would willingly follow peace with all men, and yet would be very unwilling that others &s;hould take the advantage of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition, to injure us in hopes of impunity. We would expre&s;s duty, re|&s;pect and obedience to the king, as &s;upreme, and yet we would not wi&s;h to &s;trengthen the hands of tyranny, nor call oppre&s;&s;ion lawful: In &s;uch a delicate &s;ituation it is a golden rule,
<Q>So to &s;peak, and &s;o to do, as they that &s;hall be judged by the law of liberty.</Q>
Nothing has a greater tendency to make men act wrong than the di&s;belief of a future judgment, and nothing will more effectually re&s;train and direct them than the full per&s;ua&s;ion that &s;uch an event will certainly take place: nothing would have a happier tendency to make us act with prudence, ju&s;tice and moderation than the

<P>Let me intreat you, Gentlemen, think coolly, and act deliberately; ra&s;h coun&s;els are &s;eldom good ones: mini&s;terial ra&s;hne&s;s and American ra&s;hne&s;s can only be productive of untoward compounds; incon&s;iderate mea&s;ures, framed on the other &s;ide of the atlantic, are the cau&s;e of all our mi&s;chiefs, and it is not in the lea&s;t probable that incon&s;iderate mea&s;ures in America can be productive of any good. Let nothing be done through &s;trive and vain glory; let no private re&s;ent|ment or party zeal di&s;grace your hone&s;t warmth for your country's welfare: Mea&s;ures determined on by integrity and prudence, are mo&s;t likely to be carried into execution by &s;teadine&s;s and moderation. Let neither the frowns of tyranny, nor plea&s;ure of popu|larity, &s;way you from what you clearly apprehend ju&s;t and right, and to be your duty. Con&s;ider how much lies at &s;take, how greatly your religion, your liberty, your property, your po&s;terity, is intere&s;ted. Endeavour to act like freemen, like loyal &s;ubjects, like real Chri|&s;tians,
<PB N="26" REF="014636_0045_0F943817F071BBC0">
and you will <Q>&s;o &s;peak, and &s;o act, as they that &s;hall be judged by the law of liberty.</Q>
Act con|&s;cientiou&s;ly, and with a view to GOD, then commit your ways to him, leave the event with GOD, and you will have great rea&s;on to hope that the event will be ju&s;t, honourable and happy.</P>
<P>And now, Gentlemen, you have the wi&s;hes and prayers of every thoughtful per&s;on, that your delibera|tions may be carried on with candour, unanimity and prudence, may be ble&s;&s;ed to pre&s;erve the quietne&s;s of this province, and co-operate in re&s;toring the rights and tranquillity of all America, as well as promote the pro&s;perity of the whole Briti&s;h empire. This will af|ford you a heartfelt &s;atisfaction, and tran&s;mit your name to po&s;terity with honour, when all tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ite views, and &s;ought their greatne&s;s in the ruins of others, will be held in abhorrence and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>I have but a few hints to give to my hearers in general.</P>
<P>The times are evil; this is a day of adver&s;ity, and in a time of adver&s;ity we ought to con&s;ider. It may perhaps &s;oon become impo&s;&s;ible, even to the mo&s;t in|dolent, to continue unconcerned, and tho&s;e that wi&s;h no more than to hide them&s;elves in quiet ob&s;curity, may not always have it in their power to remain neuter: To know the &s;igns of the time, is a con&s;iderable part of human prudence, and it is a &s;till greater to walk circum&s;pectly, and redeem the time, becau&s;e the days are evil. Whatever part you may think your&s;elves obliged to take,
<Q>So &s;peak, and &s;o do, as they that &s;hall be judged hereafter, and judged by the law of liberty.</Q></P>
<P>In the&s;e times of confu&s;ion I would pre&s;s on my
<PB N="27" REF="014636_0046_0F95A74E571C32E0">hearers a mo&s;t con&s;cientious regard to the common lawsof the land. Let our conduct &s;hew that we are not lawle&s;s; by well-doing let us put to &s;ilence the reproaches of our adver&s;aries. Let us convince them that we do not complain of law, but of oppre&s;&s;ion; that we do not abhor the&s;e acts becau&s;e we are im|patient to be under government, but being de&s;tructive of liberty and property, we think them de&s;tructive al&s;o of all law. Let us act
<Q>as free, and yet not make liberty a cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the &s;ervants of God.</Q></P>
<P>While it is yet peace and quietne&s;s with us, let us not think our&s;elves inacce&s;&s;ible to the evils which are already come upon others; there are &s;ome evils which we would rather deprecate in private than &s;peak of in public, again&s;t which being forewarned, we &s;hould be forearmed; every trifling report &s;hould not alarm us, but it would be folly &s;till greater not to be on our guard again&s;t &s;udden dangers.</P>
<P>Remember them that &s;uffer adver&s;ity, as being your|&s;elves al&s;o in the body. Think on tho&s;e who are driven from their habitations and all their conveniencies of life, or confined in their own hou&s;es by an enraged &s;oldiery, to &s;tarve in their own country, in the mid&s;t of property and plenty, not permitted to enjoy their own, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in every connexion, and this with|out any cau&s;e alleged again&s;t numbers of them, without complaint, &s;u&s;picion or a legal trial: The like was never heard &s;ince the cruel &s;iege of Londonderry, and is a &s;pecies of cruelty at which even that hardhearted bigot James II. relented.</P>
<P>Above all, let every one earne&s;tly pray that HE that is higher than the highe&s;t would &s;oon make a righteous end of all their confu&s;ion; that he would
<PB N="28" REF="014636_0047_0F943819ED9FF650">
incline the king to hear the cries of his &s;ubjects, and that no more innocent blood may be &s;hed in America.</P>
<P>One thing more: Con&s;ider the extreme ab&s;urdity of &s;truggling for civil liberty, and yet to continue &s;laves to &s;in and lu&s;t.
<Q>Know ye not to whom ye yield your&s;elves &s;ervants to obey, his &s;ervants ye are, to whom ye obey, whether of &s;in unto death, or of obedience unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q>
Rom. vi:16. Cea&s;e from evil, and do good, &s;eek peace, and pur&s;ue it, who will hurt you while you follow that which is good; become the willing &s;ervants of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, hearken to and obey the voice of his go&s;pel; for

<HEAD>From the &s;imilarity of the &s;ubject, an extract from another &s;ermon is added:</HEAD>
<P>THE que&s;tion between Great-Britain and Ame|rica, which has already been productive of &s;uch alarming effects, is,
<Q>Whether the parliament of Great-Britain have any power or authority to tax the Americans without their con&s;ent?</Q>
Every im|partial man will allow that this is the foundation of the whole di&s;pute. It is evident that in this que&s;tion con&s;cience is deeply intere&s;ted, and in this view it be|comes a very proper &s;ubject for the pulpit. If any thing is required of &s;ubjects which in con&s;cience they are bound to pay, give or do, the refu&s;al of it is not only a crime again&s;t the &s;tate, but al&s;o a &s;in again&s;t GOD: I think it therefore not only not improper, but
<PB N="29" REF="014636_0048_0F94381A2D41D4A8">
my duty, to point out unto my hearers &s;uch hints and precedents as may illu&s;trate this matter from the word of GOD.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e I would &s;tate thus,
<Q>Whether any duty or impo&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed to be laid on in an illegal man|ner, and incon&s;i&s;tent with natural and civil rights, from motives of con&s;cience ought neverthele&s;s to be paid?</Q>
and to elucidate this, I ob&s;erve, the general rule is this:
<Q>Render therefore to all their dues; tri|bute to whom tribute is due, cu&s;tom to whom cu|&s;tom; fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</Q> Rom. xiii:7. There is &s;omething <HI>due</HI> to government which cannot be refu&s;ed without inju&s;tice, and more than which cannot be demanded without tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. When our LORD was a&s;ked,
<Q>What thinke&s;t thou, is it lawful to give tribute unto Ce&s;ar or not?</Q>
he gave a very wi&s;e and general an&s;wer,
<Q>Render therefore unto Ce&s;ar the things which are Ce&s;ar's, and unto GOD the things which are GOD's.</Q> Matth. xxii:17.21. We are informed, that upon another occa&s;ion he paid the tribute-money, and that, after a&s;king Peter of whom do the kings of the earth take cu&s;tom or tribute? and Peter an&s;wering of &s;trangers, he remarked, "Then are the children free;" and yet neverthele&s;s, as a voluntary act, ordered Peter, <Q>Take a piece of money, and give unto them, for me and thee.</Q> Matth. xvii:25-27.</P>
<P>On the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages I &s;hall make but two remarks, which are very obvious, and will apply them&s;elves: 1. How far &s;oever the power of the magi&s;trate and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject may be extended, it is plain that by the&s;e rules and precedents property is left to the &s;ub|ject. To render, give, or pay, &s;uppo&s;es property. Tho&s;e who may be ju&s;tly deprived of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s, at
<PB N="30" REF="014636_0049_0F94381AEE3CAF68" MS="y">
another's plea&s;ure, cannot be &s;aid to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any property; and therefore they can neither give, pay, or render; they are them&s;elves the property of another. I would further ob&s;erve, 2. That from the an&s;wer our LORD gives unto Peter, it appears that &s;overeigns ought to treat their &s;ubjects as children, and that children ought to be free. O the free and benevolent &s;pirit of the go&s;pel!</P>
<P>By &s;ome it is urged, that &s;overeigns have a right to take away what their &s;ubjects po&s;&s;e&s;s, at plea&s;ure. This right they ground on the following pa&s;&s;age, 1 Sam. viii:10&mdash;
<Q>This will be the manner of the king that &s;hall reign over you, he will take your &s;ons, and ap|point them for him&s;elf, for his chariots, and to be hor&s;emen, and &s;ome &s;hall run before his chariots&mdash; and he will take your daughters, to be confectionaries and to be cooks and bakers; and he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the be&s;t of them, and give them to his &s;ervants; and he will take the tenth of your &s;eed, and of your vine|yards, and give to his officers and his &s;ervants; and he will take your men-&s;ervants and your maid-&s;er|vants, and your goodlie&s;t young men, and your a&s;&s;es, and put them to his work; he will take the tenth of your &s;heep, and <HI>ye &s;hall be his &s;ervants.</HI></Q>
Here then, according to &s;ome, is the warrant of divine right for arbitrary power. Tho&s;e however, who found authority to do what is wrong in a repre&s;entation, meant to deter the Jews from putting it in any man's power to treat them thus, would do well to con&s;ider that from the text it&s;elf it plainly appears, this was not to be con|&s;idered as a right, but as a grievance, which their folly had brought on them&s;elves.
<Q>You &s;hall cry in that day, and the LORD will not hear you.</Q> Your mi&s;ery
<PB N="31" REF="014636_0050_0F94381BABF70528">
will be the effect of your own folly. We have an|other precedent, which &s;eems &s;omewhat in point: Re|hoboam was a fooli&s;h &s;on of a wi&s;e father; it &s;eems he laid a tribute on I&s;rael: (2 Chron. xiii:18.) The people applied unto him, pre&s;ented their grievances, and prayed redre&s;s:
<Q>Thy father made our yoke grievous, now therefore do thou make it lighter, and we will &s;erve thee.</Q>
This the council of the old men ad|vi&s;ed him to do; they &s;aid,
<Q>If thou wilt &s;peak good words unto them, they will be thy &s;ervants forever.</Q>
But more violent coun&s;els prevailed, the acts were en|forced,
<Q>I will add to your yoke, I will cha&s;ti&s;e you with &s;corpions.</Q>
This the deluded monarch pro|bably con&s;idered as firmne&s;s and dignity; but what was the event? When all I&s;rael &s;aw that the king hearkened not unto them, they &s;aid,
<Q>What portion have we in David? to your tents, o I&s;rael! now &s;ee to thine own hou&s;e David.</Q>
A kind and ju&s;t an&s;wer might have prevented this; and what did the king him&s;elf gain? "The king &s;ent Adoram, who was over the tri|bute, and all I&s;rael &s;toned him, that he died, and the king <HI>fled</HI> to Jeru&s;alem" Thus far tyranny was very un&s;ucce&s;sful. But this is not all; when the army of Judah was now ready to fall upon the ten tribes, GOD him&s;elf interpo&s;ed,
<Q>Ye &s;hall not fight again&s;t your brethren, the children of I&s;rael; return every man to his hou&s;e, for this thing is of me.</Q>
Thus this matter ended in a &s;eparation of the two kingdoms, and this very Roboam him&s;elf afterwards became a &s;ervant, and tributary to the king of Egypt.</P>
<P>I leave the application of all the&s;e things to tho&s;e whom it may concern; but would further ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>Every government mu&s;t be &s;upported, and what is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of government, is al&s;o ju&s;tly

due, and ought to be GIVEN with readine&s;s and willingly.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that think their &s;uperiors have a right to take away their property, or any part of it, without their con&s;ent, upon their own principle are guilty of &s;inful re&s;i&s;tance and rebellion, if they do not comply with whatever government may demand.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King James the Fir&s;t a&s;ked the bi&s;hops Nel&s;on and Andrews, whether he had a right to rai&s;e money on his own authority?

<HEAD>A SHORT AND CONCISE ACCOUNT OF THE STRUGGLES OF <HI>SWISSER|LAND</HI> FOR LIBERTY.</HEAD>
<P>TO a benevolent mind taking a &s;urvey of the globe, it mu&s;t be a very melancholy con&s;ideration that liberty, which is the birthright of man, is &s;till confined to a few &s;mall &s;pots of our earth: All A&s;ia and Africa are out of the que&s;tion; in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere of America it is un|known, and a&s;toni&s;hing pains are now taken to drive it out of this northern Continent In Europe Great-Britain is com|monly viewed as the &s;eat of it; but if the conjecture of the bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph be not void of foundation, even there it hath a &s;ickly countenance; SWISSERLAND, by that great man, is the only country which de&s;erves to be called free, and even Voltaire pronounceth it happy. By what means the Swi&s;s re|covered and pre&s;erved their freedom, is the &s;ubject of the fol|lowing narrative.</P>
<P>The three countries (u&s;ually called cantons) of Ury, Switz and Underwalden, which fir&s;t entered into a confederacy that laid the foundation of the republic of Swi&s;&s;erland, are but of &s;mall extent, all the three cantons together do not exceed &s;eventy miles in length and about thirty in breadth; they are al&s;o very thinly inhabited, owing to their &s;ituation among the Alps, many of which are covered with everla&s;ting &s;now, and inacce&s;&s;ible to man or bea&s;t; it is u&s;ually &s;aid of the climate, that there is nine months winter and three months cold. At the time of their revolution the country was not nearly &s;o well cultivated as it is at pre&s;ent, and at pre&s;ent all the inhabitants of the three cantons, capable of bearing arms, are not e&s;timated above 12,000 men; a &s;mall number to make head with, as they did, again&s;t the very powerful hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Power and number do not prove the ju&s;tice of any cau&s;e, and it is more honourable to be defeated in the cau&s;e of virtue and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, than to erect trophies to inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion. All Swi&s;&s;erland was &s;ubjugated by Julius Cae&s;ar; it became after|wards &s;ubject to different Lords, and had a nobility which
<PB N="34" REF="014636_0053_0F943820311C3078">
treated their inferiors with great petulancy and violence. The three cantons cho&s;e Rudolph of Hab&s;burg to be their captain, and on his being cho&s;en Roman emperor in 1273, the nobility complained again&s;t the&s;e countries before him, and called them rebellious; but when the emperor &s;aw their charters, he acquitted them, confirmed their privileges, and gave them governors that were not inhabitants of the&s;e countries, and were not to tyrannize over, but only from time to time to come among them, to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice. Thus the country was quiet, &s;ubmitted to their governors; and had they been always treated with equal ju&s;tice, probably would have con|tinued &s;o to this day, but <HI>Nullum violentum diuturnum,</HI> "No|thing that is violent la&s;ts long."</P>
<P>After the decea&s;e of Rudolph of Hab&s;burg, Adolphus of Na&s;|&s;au was cho&s;en emperor; he confirmed their liberty, and they continued in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his government. Adolphus was &s;lain in battle by the own hands of his rival, Albertus of Au&s;tria, &s;on of Rudolph; and it has been ob&s;erved that neither this Albertus, nor any that were active again&s;t Adolphus, died of a natural death.</P>
<P>Albertus of Au&s;tria, having a numerous family of children, projected the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new principality in Swi&s;&s;erland which then was a part of the empire; many imperial fiefs he apropriated to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, purcha&s;ed &s;ome juri&s;|dictions which belonged to mona&s;teries, and having made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;ome &s;trong places, he thought to &s;ubdue the&s;e three cantons al&s;o, and &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Ury, Switz and Underwalden, reque&s;ting that they would &s;urrender them&s;elves to him and the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, under many very fair promi&s;es. When his amba&s;&s;adors arrived among them, the cantons pro|duced their charters, and al&s;o &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to the emperor, praying that they might be confirmed, and that they might not be torn from the empire, and put in &s;ubjection to the then new hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. In&s;tead of being gratified, as they had hoped, they were not only refu&s;ed, but the emperor al&s;o would not take the lea&s;t notice of their complaints again&s;t their gover|nors, but appointed two new governors over them, which from day to day proceeded to new and unheard of acts of violence. The de&s;ign was, by &s;uch means to excite an in&s;ur|rection among the inhabitants, and then, under pretence of being rebellious, to make war upon them, and entirely to
<PB N="35" REF="014636_0054_0F9438210ADE9BA8">
bring them under the yoke. The&s;e are the expre&s;s words of an hi&s;torian, and in different times and places, tyranny makes u&s;e of the &s;ame arts. The tyranny and cruelty of the&s;e gover|nors continually encrea&s;ed. At that time there lived in Un|derwalden an aged and hone&s;t inhabitant, who&s;e name was Henry de Melchdall. The governor ordered two oxen to be taken from his plough, without even charging him with any crime; the hone&s;t man wanted at lea&s;t to know what had been his fault; but the governor's officer an&s;wered it was the will of the governor that henceforth the pea&s;ants &s;hould work in the plough them&s;elves, and took away the oxen by force; the &s;on of the farmer, enraged at &s;o much inju&s;tice and vio|lence, gave the officer a blow with a &s;tick, and wounded his finger, and then fled the country immediately The governor put his aged father in pri&s;on, and wanted to oblige him to de|liver up his &s;on; he excu&s;ed him&s;elf that he did not know what became of him, but the governor ordered both his eyes to be put out, and took from him all he had.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Rozberg was occupied by the governor's de|puty of the family of Wolfen&s;hie&s;s, the &s;ame &s;eeing a very hand&s;ome woman, wanted to con&s;train her to gratify his bru|tal lu&s;t; under &s;ome pretence &s;he withdrew, met her hu&s;band, who being informed of it, gave the governor a back-&s;troke with an axe, and al&s;o immediately fled the country.</P>
<P>Werner Stauffacre, a re&s;pectable man in the canton Switz, was building a hand&s;ome new hou&s;e; the governor riding by, enquired of him who&s;e it was? Stauffacre, aware of &s;ome de|&s;ign if he &s;hould dare to call it his own, replied, My noble governor, the hou&s;e belongs to my king and you, and it is my fief. This fru&s;trated the governor's de&s;ign, but he told him withall, I will not &s;uffer it that pea&s;ants &s;hould build hou&s;es for them&s;elves as though they were lords, I will bridle you more clo&s;ely.</P>
<P>Governor Grisler, of Ury, could not help perceiving the di&s;&s;atisfaction of the people, and that he might di&s;cover the malecontents, he placed a hat on a pole at Altdorff, and gave &s;trict orders, that every one &s;hould pay that hat the &s;ame honour as if he were pre&s;ent him&s;elf; he al&s;o placed &s;ome &s;pies to ob&s;erve who &s;hould pay obei&s;ance to his hat and who &s;hould neglect it. This in&s;olence wrought &s;o effectually on the people, that even &s;ome of the nobility declared it impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="36" REF="014636_0055_0F943821AD9A9750">
any longer to endure &s;uch tyrannical proceedings. Among numbers that thought &s;o in their hearts, there was one that had courage to refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch a badge of abject &s;lavery. William Tell pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal times without pulling his hat; he was informed again&s;t, and after &s;ome impri&s;on|ment, condemned, at the di&s;tance of one hundred and twenty yards, with his bow and arrow to take off an apple off the head of a beloved child of his, about &s;ix years old, and threatened with death in ca&s;e he mi&s;&s;ed. No remon&s;trance availed, his life and that of his &s;on was threatened in ca&s;e of refu&s;al; the afflicted parent mo&s;t tenderly took his leave of his child, the &s;pectators melted in tears, but he providentially hit the apple without doing any injury to his child. This hap|pened October 30, 1307; and romantic as it may &s;eem, pu|blic monuments to this day confirm the truth of the fact The people congratulated Tell on his &s;ucce&s;s; but the governor ob&s;erving he had another arrow in his quiver, a&s;ked him the meaning. Tell at fir&s;t excu&s;ed him&s;elf with the common cu|&s;tom of marksmen: but this not &s;atisfying the governor, and he &s;olemnly promi&s;ing him his life if he &s;hould declare the truth, Tell very frankly &s;aid, that had he had the misfortune to have done any injury to his child, he was determined to &s;end the next arrow to the heart of the tyrannical governor. The governor condemned him to impri&s;onment for the re&s;t of his days. Tell was permitted to bid farewell to his family, and then bound to be carried acro&s;s a lake to the place of his cap|tivity, and in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el the governor al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed with his attendants. The lake of Lucerne is very liable to &s;evere and &s;udden tempe&s;ts, a &s;torm of this kind brought them all into the mo&s;t immediate danger: in this extremity Tell, who was known to be a good pilot, was ordered to take the helm, and he laboured &s;o effectually that he brought the ve&s;&s;el near the &s;hore; which he had no &s;ooner effected, than he jumped out, and pu&s;hed the ve&s;&s;el off. The governor, with great difficulty, landed at &s;ome di&s;tance, but in the way to his ca&s;tle he was waylaid by Tell in a narrow road, who placed the re&s;erved arrow in his heart that he in&s;tantly fell dead from the hor&s;e; and Tell had time to fly to &s;ome of his friends and give them notice of this event. The&s;e were Werner Stauffacre, Walter F&uuml;r&s;t and Arnold de Melchdall; the&s;e were partly &s;orry to hear of this event, as it had been agreed upon to do nothing
<PB N="37" REF="014636_0056_0F943822703FF1A8">
before the fir&s;t of January, 1308, when an attempt to recover liberty was to be made by the three cantons at once; they apprehended the killing of the governor before they were ready to follow the blow, would fru&s;trate their attempt, and bring matters to a cri&s;is before they were prepared; but ty|rants frequently ha&s;ten their own doom by their own mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The oppre&s;&s;ive governors were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of three ca&s;tles, and un|le&s;s the&s;e were reduced, the oppre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t become every day more intolerable: One of the confederates had an amorous connexion with a &s;ervant-maid in the ca&s;tle of Rozberg; &s;he, as u&s;ual, fur|ni&s;hed him with means of entering, and he introduced twenty of his friends, who &s;eized the ca&s;tle and the governor without difficulty. The ca&s;tle at Sarnen was taken by another &s;tratagem: It was cu|&s;tomary on new year's day to bring pre&s;ents to the governor; twenty confederates accordingly appeared at the ca&s;tle gates early in the morning, and made the governor the u&s;ual compliments, armed with nothing but long &s;taves; the governor was ju&s;t agoing to ma&s;s, and as he &s;aw them without arms, ordered them to carry their gifts in|to the ca&s;tle. They had no &s;ooner entered, but they fixed irons which they had concealed to their &s;ticks, made pri&s;oners of the garri&s;on, and the ca&s;tle was demoli&s;hed. The governors betook them&s;elves to flight, and nobody offered to pur&s;ue them. Thus in one day all the &s;trong holds were taken and de&s;troyed, and the next day the three cantons &s;olemnly &s;wore to each other for the &s;pace of ten years: This &s;mall beginning laid the foundation of the republic of Swi&s;&s;er|land, which has maintained its freedom and independency until this time, and nearly &s;urvived the liberty of mo&s;t &s;tates of Europe.</P>
<P>The emperor Albert had now obtained his wi&s;h, viz. a pretext to reduce the cantons by open war, under pretence of rebellion. He immediately repaired to Baden, <HI>&s;topt all commerce with the&s;e three cantons, and ordered his va&s;&s;als to declare war again&s;t them</HI>; but while he meditated war again&s;t an oppre&s;&s;ed people, he was him&s;elf mur|dered by his nephew, who&s;e inheritance he unju&s;tly detained from him; his murderer hoped to find a place of retreat among the&s;e can|tons, but the Swi&s;s, zealous for their liberty, were incapable to &s;e|cure it by giving an a&s;ylum unto criminals; his widow was &s;o bent upon avenging the death of her hu&s;band, that &s;he took no mea&s;ures again&s;t the Swi&s;s, who had re&s;i&s;ted the oppre&s;&s;ions of their tyranni|cal governors.</P>
<P>Leopold, the &s;on of Albert, when he came of age, determined to make war again&s;t the three cantons, and collected an army of 20,000 men for that purpo&s;e; his plan was to attack the confederates the 15th of November, 1311, at a place called Morgarden, &s;ituate be|tween a lake and a mountain. In expectation that the inhabitants
<PB N="38" REF="014636_0057_0F9438232D2A7060">
of Underwalden would come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the confederates, the Count of Stra&s;berg and the city of Lucern were to invade the cantons at the &s;ame time and at two different places. At dinner he a&s;ked the opinion of his je&s;ter, who replied,
<Q>All advi&s;e how to en|ter into the country, it &s;eems to me nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider how to come out again.</Q>
His advi&s;e was de&s;pi&s;ed, but verified by the event. A brave and virtuous people may be attacked, but wo to ty|rants that cannot retreat.</P>
<P>The plan was exactly followed; Leopold made a fal&s;e attack at Arth, and perhaps the confederates would have placed all their little force there, if they had not received an information to "beware at Morgarden." To that place the cantons Ury and Underwalden &s;ent 700 men, and the canton Swi&s;s an equal number, who were po&s;ted on a mountain called the Saddle. On the day appointed the duke of Au&s;tria advanced at the head of his cavalry, his troops marched in great confidence, "<HI>&s;ure to obtain an ea&s;y victory upon pea&s;ants, badly armed, and without military di&s;cipline:</HI>" Accordingly they proudly pre&s;&s;ed into a defile, when they were &s;topt by 50 men, who had been bani&s;hed the cantons for crimes, and whom, notwith&s;tanding their reque&s;t, the confederates would not think worthy to fight for liberty, even upon this pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion. The&s;e men, however, by generou&s;ly expo&s;ing them&s;elves for their country, hoped to de&s;erve the pardon of former crimes, they po&s;ted them&s;elves on a very &s;teep hill, above a narrow path, where the Au&s;trian army could not march above two men a-brea&s;t; they &s;uffered them very quietly to advance, but when a con&s;iderable number were now engaged in the&s;e narrow roads, they &s;ent &s;uch a &s;hower of &s;tones and rolled large pieces of timber among the Au&s;trian cavalry, that they were &s;oon put in con|fu&s;ion; which the Swi&s;s no &s;ooner perceived, than they fell upon them with &s;uch fury, that they were obliged to retreat towards the plain; to gain ground to form the order of battle, the infantry opened their ranks, to let the cavalry pa&s;s; at this moment the con|federates broke in upon them, and &s;tanding on ri&s;ing ground, their halbards did mo&s;t dreadful execution. A cotemporary author &s;aith, it was not a fight but a ma&s;&s;acre. The prince lo&s;t near 1500 of his hor&s;e, the lo&s;s of the infantry could not be a&s;certained, but 52 men from Zuric, then in the intere&s;t of Au&s;tria, were all found &s;lain in a heap; the lo&s;s of the confederates was incredibly trifling: Mean|while the count of Stra&s;berg, with 4000 men had al&s;o invaded Un|derwalden, who &s;end to their friends at Morgarden, and 400 of the victorious Swi&s;s in&s;tantly fled to their relief; they came up with a body of their own people, with whom they attacked the count, who &s;eeing colours among them that had been at Morgarden, judged his ma&s;ter was defeated, and &s;o fled. The Swi&s;s killed about 300 of his men in the retreat. After this battle gained, the three cantons en|tered
<PB N="39" REF="014636_0058_0F943823F7DFC1B8">
into a perpetual alliance, which no power has &s;ince been able to break, and which heaven has remarkably pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>One of the next greate&s;t battle the Swi&s;s fought in defence of their liberty, was in the year 1386. Leopold, duke of Au&s;tria&punc; per&s;onally repaired to Swi&s;&s;erland, in order to carry on the war with greater vigour. The duke had re&s;olved to lay &s;iege to Sempach: the con|federates had intelligence of it, and both oppo&s;ite armies arrived before this little town the very &s;ame day. The Au&s;trian advanced guard con&s;i&s;ting of about 1400 men, committed all manner of vio|lence on their territory: One of their officers mounted a cart loaded with halters, and threatened to hang all the inhabitants before &s;un|&s;et. The Au&s;trians in&s;ulted the Swi&s;s, it being in the time of hay|making, they came &s;o near the walls to &s;peak with them, and de|&s;ired they would &s;end dinner and wages to their mowers. The Swi&s;s replied, it was not the cu&s;tom of the Swi&s;s to pay wages till they were earned, and that they would prepare a dinner for them, that many &s;poons &s;hould drop out of their hands. The duke's army con&s;i&s;ted of about 4000 picked men, and among them many princes and noblemen, armed from head to foot. The confederates were about 1300 men, badly armed, and all on foot; they had no arms but hal|bards, and fa&s;tened pieces of wood on their arms, to fend off and break the blows of the enemies; their order of battle was very clo&s;e, and repre&s;ented an angle, one &s;oldier was followed by two, two by four, and &s;o on; in this order this handful of men courage|ou&s;ly advanced again&s;t the enemy. Before they begun the engage|ment, as was u&s;ual with them, they fell down to prayers which made the duke's je&s;ter &s;ay, <Q>Leopold, my countrymen (for he was a Swi&s;s) have all lift up their hands, and &s;worn to almighty GOD, to kill thee.</Q> An Au&s;trian officer, ob&s;erving their undaunted coun|tenance, advi&s;ed to delay the battle till next day&punc; but a nobleman de|clared, <Q>He would deliver that handful of boors before &s;upper into the hands of the duke roa&s;ted or boiled, as he &s;hould be&s;t like them.</Q> The nobility was &s;o eager to engage, that they di&s;mounted, gave their hor&s;es into the care of their &s;ervants, and would not &s;uf|fer any but noblemen to &s;hare in the honour of the day. It happened that a young nobleman, in cutting off the long point of his &s;hoe (as all the re&s;t did) wounded his toe which made him cry, whereupon the nobility ordered him out of the rank, as unworthy to fight His brethren were all &s;lain, and his life was &s;aved. The battle begun, the &s;uperior power of the Au&s;trians in men and arms &s;oon appeared, 60 confederates were killed before they could make the lea&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion on their enemy in this di&s;tre&s;s a brave knight of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;acrifice his life for his country, he accordingly advanced boldly, and with his arms gra&s;ped and bent

down as many of their long pikes as he could hold, the others pre&s;&s;ed after him with irre&s;i&s;table fury, broke in with their halbards upon the Au&s;trians, and made dreadful havock.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that before the engagement they proclaimed that every man that thought him&s;elf in&s;ufficient to encounter ten Au&s;trians, might withdraw, and that about 300 withdrew according|ly; but when the&s;e &s;aw the Au&s;trians order of battle broke, they ha&s;tened to a&s;&s;i&s;t their brethren, and the nobility lo&s;t courage, gave way to the Swi&s;s, and many of them, from the heat of the day and &s;everity of the engagement, were &s;uffocated by the weight of their own armour. The duke was &s;everal times entreated to withdraw, but &s;eeing his banner in danger, he generou&s;ly advanced to re&s;cue it, but fell in the attempt. When the &s;ervants, who had been ordered in the rear with the hor&s;es &s;aw the defeat of their ma&s;ters, they mounted their ma&s;ters hor&s;es, and left their ma&s;ters to &s;hift for them&s;elves. It is &s;uppo&s;ed the lo&s;s of the Au&s;trians amounted to 2000. including 667 of the nobility, and among them 350 with crowned ca&s;kets. The Swi&s;s lo&s;t about 200, who were all carried to their re&s;pective homes. The third day they permitted the enemy to carry off their dead, among whom the duke was the principal; he was carried of the field of battle in a great box (&s;till extant), which, 'tis &s;aid, had been full of halters, to hang the confederates. The Swi&s;s, in hopes of ob|taining peace, were &s;paring of the blood of the Au&s;trians, and did not pur&s;ue them in their retreat; they had rea&s;on to repent their lenity, but the continuance of the war &s;erved only to increa&s;e the victories and fame of the Swi&s;s confederates. The &s;ons of the de|feated Leopold made great preparation for war, and many imperial cities joined with them again&s;t the Swi&s;s; a truce was indeed con|cluded, which the Au&s;trians badly kept, and by &s;urprize and &s;ecret intelligence made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of We&s;en, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which laid the whole canton of Glaris open to their ravages. The Swi&s;s confederates advi&s;ed that canton to get the be&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible, but tho&s;e propo&s;ed by the Au&s;trians were &s;o exce&s;&s;ive &s;evere, that that treaty came to nothing. The Au&s;trians propo&s;ed them&s;elves to invade that country with about 8000 men; the inhabitants had ca&s;t up an entrenchment, which was guarded by about 350 men; when the Au&s;trians advanced, the&s;e finding them&s;elves to weak to re&s;i&s;t, retreated to a ri&s;ing ground, the Au&s;trians penetrated into the coun|try, and burned the village of Na&s;els, and then attacked the above|mentioned handful of inhabitants, who received them with a &s;hower of &s;tones; the Au&s;trians having retreated a little to put them&s;elves under cover, the Swi&s;s &s;eized the favourable moment, and fell upon them with &s;uch fury, that after an engagement of five hours, they were forced to fly. The Swi&s;s pur&s;ued and came up with them at
<PB N="41" REF="014636_0060_0F943827E25BA780">
a bridge, where about 700 Swi&s;s had gathered; the Au&s;trians, in their confu&s;ion not aware that the bridge was broke, pre&s;&s;ed on&punc; and numbers were drowned. The lo&s;s of the Au&s;trians was computed at 20<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0, while that of the Swi&s;s did not exceed 55 men.</P>
<P>The dukes of Au&s;tria again con&s;ented to a truce, by which the Swi&s;s were to remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all their conque&s;ts; this truce in 1314 was renewed for twenty, and in 1412 for fifty years longer. The Swi&s;s made u&s;e of the&s;e times of tranquillity to give &s;tability and perfection to their military di&s;ciplines. In 1393 they agreed up|on the following regulations among them&s;elves: 1. No church nor chapel to be attacked, unle&s;s it is made u&s;e of as an a&s;ylum to the enemy. 2. No woman to be violated or in&s;ulted. 3. <HI>Every Swi&s;s engageth to &s;acrifice his &s;ub&s;tance and life for his country.</HI> 4. No Swi&s;s to for&s;ake his po&s;t, even tho' wounded. 5. Forbids to pillage with|out leave of the commander, and orders the &s;poils to be equally divided 7. All that &s;end provi&s;ions to the Swi&s;s &s;hall be protected. 8. No canton to make war without the con&s;ent of the re&s;t. 9. No Swi&s;s to take away any thing by violence from another, neither in time of war nor peace.</P>
<P>The Swi&s;s carried their military di&s;cipline to &s;uch perfection, that Machiavel pretends no nations ever exceeded them in that re&s;pect, except the Romans.</P>
<P>On the whole then we may conceive the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of li|berty in Swi&s;&s;erland thus: 1. They had &s;ome rights and liberties granted them by emperors, which do not appear very con&s;iderable. 2. The emperors of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria endeavoured to &s;eparate them from the Roman empire, and bring them in &s;ubjection to the then ri&s;ing hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. 3. Again&s;t this the Swi&s;s remon&s;trated, petitioned and pleaded their charters. 4. Governors were &s;ent among them, who were to, and did, oppre&s;s them, in order to drive them to &s;ome act of de&s;pair, which their enemies intended to term rebellion, and under pretence of it reduce them by force of arms. This, 5. at length produced confederacies, fir&s;t only of three men, by degrees of three &s;mall countries, which encrea&s;ed gradually to <HI>thirteen</HI> cantons, be&s;ides &s;ome confederates. 6. To &s;ubdue them, a &s;top was fir&s;t put to their trade, and afterwards they were attacked by force. 7. When attacked, they defended them&s;elves with in|credible bravery, and under every po&s;&s;ible di&s;advantage re&s;i&s;ted every attack and at la&s;t obliged their enemies not only to de&s;i&s;t, but to declare them a free &s;tate; and &s;urrounded by Au&s;tria, France and Savoy they have continued free and brave ever &s;ince, and may they do &s;o to the end of time.</P>
