</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;acred Penman of this P&s;alm &s;ets forth the way and end of the righteous and wicked: The happine&s;s of the one, and the mi&s;ery of the other: The great difference in the temper of their minds and conduct in the world, and the great difference, which will be made betwixt them in the future judgment. The godly and ungodly, the righteous and unrighteous, are in &s;acred writ oppo&s;ed to each other. Godline&s;s &s;ig|nifies piety towards God; and righteou&s;ne&s;s, equity towards man. But godline&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, be|ing &s;o often put for one and the &s;ame thing, they may, &s;eparately taken, hold forth the two branches of the good man's character, piety towards God, and equity towards man: So the ungodly and un|righteous, being often u&s;ed for one and the &s;ame per&s;on, &s;eparately taken, may &s;ignify men impious towards God, and unrighteous towards man; the real character of the wicked.</P>
<P>By the ungodly then, we may under&s;tand a &s;in|ner under the guilt and power of &s;in; di&s;obedient and rebellions again&s;t the &s;overeign authority and righteous law of a holy God, and unrighteous to|wards

man. This is the man, who, among others, mu&s;t die and come to judgment. Being a &s;inner, death mu&s;t be his inevitable portion; and as death leaves him, &s;o judgment will find him! Being found in judgment ungodly, impious towards God, and unrighteous towards man, he cannot &s;tand in judg|ment. By his character, it mu&s;t appear before the righteous and impartial Judge&punc; that he is an unbe|liever, out of Chri&s;t; that he has not hence a righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which will an&s;wer the law: When there|fore he appears in the judgment, not only without the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law, but without &s;o much as a per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s, and his deeds produced be|fore the judgment-&s;eat as witne&s;&s;es to prove him un|godly, he cannot in ju&s;tice be ju&s;tified and acquitted, but mu&s;t fall, and be ju&s;tly condemned. The un|godly &s;hall not &s;tand in the judgment. The pro|po&s;itions &s;ugge&s;ted, and to be illu&s;trated, upon this &s;olemn occa&s;ion, are&mdash;

<P N="1">1. There will be a future Judgment. The cer|tainty of this I &s;hall endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h, and then give a brief account of the nature and de&s;ign of it. May the attention of all be &s;erious and &s;olemn, and every heart be affected with truth, as the weight and importance of it require!</P>
<P>The certainty of a future judgment is &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed in the divine word:
<Q>For God &s;hall bring every work into judgment, with every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</Q>
Eccl. xii.14. He hath
<Q>appointed a day, in the which he will
<PB N="7" REF="011973_0004_0F87CEA757389C50">
judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q>
Act. xvii.31.
<Q>We mu&s;t all appear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t.</Q>
2 Cor. v.10. That there is therefore a day appointed for a future judgment, and that all men mu&s;t appear before the judgment &s;eat for judg|ment, is as true as the word of God. No man then, unle&s;s he be a profane and impious Dei&s;t, or a Rebel-infidel, will pre&s;ume to call the truth of it in que&s;tion.&mdash;Be&s;ides, as God is a Being infinitely righteous and holy, both in him&s;elf and in all his proceedings with his creatures, it appears rational that there mu&s;t be a judgment-day to ju&s;tify the innocent, or to manife&s;t their innocence, and to puni&s;h the wicked; this not being fully and always done in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. Though God at times overthrows the ungodly for their ungodly deeds; yet this being not a &s;tate of retribution, but of trial, he often forbears to execute &s;entence again&s;t evil works, and doth not "puni&s;h the wicked according to their de&s;erts." Eccl. viii.11. The ungodly are often, in the cour&s;e of providence, exalted, and the godly ca&s;t down. A wicked Dives fares &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, and a godly Lazarus lies full of &s;ores; di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed with poverty, and is denied the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table. And is there not often wickedne&s;s in the place of judgment? Iniquity in hu|man Courts of Judicature? The innocent condemn|ed, and the guilty go free? The Son of God was wickedly arraigned, accu&s;ed, condemned, and exe|cuted. Many, of whom the world is not worthy, &s;uffer cruel bonds and impri&s;onment, and are per&s;e|cuted unto death. The hearts of many are
<Q>fully &s;et in them to do evil.</Q>
The ungodly will trample upon the laws of God; de&s;pi&s;e his authority; reject the go&s;pel with contempt, and
<Q>crucify the Son of
<PB N="8" REF="011973_0005_0F87CEAB972F5168">
God afre&s;h.</Q>
Shall &s;uch things lie in eternal &s;i|lence? Nay, the&s;e things &s;how that God will judge the righteous and the wicked:
<Q>For the Judge of all the earth will do right.</Q>
The holine&s;s and ju&s;tice of God call for a day of judgment, when his righteous government of the world &s;hall be fully vindicated, and right fully take place.&mdash;Again,</P>
<P>The voice of con&s;cience gives its te&s;timony to the certainty of a future judgment. The con&s;ciences of men with, and without, a revealed law, excu&s;e or accu&s;e, according as they do good or evil, and that in reference to a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;h|ments. To this purpo&s;e, when St. Paul rea&s;oned before Felix,
<Q>of righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance, and judgment to come,</Q>
we find he trembled. This aro&s;e from a con&s;cience convinced of a future judg|ment, when he mu&s;t account for his unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s and intemperance. Upon the &s;ame principle, many, when they have been be&s;t prepared to judge of truth, have profe&s;&s;ed their belief, and dread of a future judgment. How many, who have put far away the evil day, and braved it out again&s;t death, and the terrors of God's holy law, have at length, with horror, profe&s;&s;ed that they were go|ing to that dreadful judgment of the great God, which they had neglected to prepare for? How many Athei&s;ts, Dei&s;ts and Apo&s;tates, who have braved it out in a day of pro&s;perity, have found in a day of di&s;tre&s;s, that they could &s;tupify con&s;cience no longer, but have been obliged to fall before God, and acknowledge not only his being and word, but a future and terrible judgment? Great then is the force and evidence of this truth, and it &s;hall prevail.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011973_0006_0F87CEACF8357B08">The account we have of the nature of this future judgment, is this, viz. that it will be a &s;olemn, righ|teous, exact and critical, univer&s;al and final judg|ment. Mu&s;t it not be the mo&s;t &s;olemn day, that ever angels or men have known, when the &s;upreme Judge &s;hall come forth with a &s;hout! With the voice of the Archangel, and trump of God! The dead are rai&s;ed! The judgment-&s;eat is made ready, and the Judge hath took his &s;eat! A countle&s;s mul|titude &s;tand before this &s;eat for ju&s;tice: The &s;en|tence of ab&s;olution, with a "come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father," is pronounced upon the godly in accents of inconceivable grace; and the &s;entence of con|demnation is pa&s;&s;ed in accents of inconceivable wrath, and executed upon the ungodly! This will be a righteous and an impartial judgment. God will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. No partial favour will be &s;hewn here. The per&s;ons of princes will not be accepted for their grandeur; nor will the rich be regarded for their riches; nor will the poor be de&s;pi&s;ed for their poverty: But with righteou&s;ne&s;s, and without partiality, will the ju&s;t Judge di&s;tribute rewards and puni&s;hments to high and low, rich and poor. This will be a judg|ment mo&s;t exact and critical: Secret things are all to be laid open, tried and judged! The weighty matters of the eternal judgment are not to be hurried over. Some think the day of judgment will take up as long a time, as the world will &s;tand: Let this be as it will; the &s;earcher of hearts will let no ca&s;e e&s;cape, without the mo&s;t exact and critical exami|nation and trial. This will be an univer&s;al judg|ment: "We mu&s;t all appear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t;" righteous and unrighteous, men and devils mu&s;t obey the univer&s;al &s;ummons, and come
<PB N="10" REF="011973_0007_0F87CEAD863F26D0">
to trial. This will be the final judgment. No ap|peal from the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t; the final &s;entence is there given. This &s;entence is, like the laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians, unalterable: It is a &s;entence for eternity, and the execution of it is una|voidable.</P>
<P>The great ends and de&s;igns of this future, final and eternal judgment are, for the manife&s;tation of the honour and glory of the great Judge, and for the vindication of his righteous providence and govern|ment of the world; for the manife&s;tation of his mercy and grace, in the compleat &s;alvation of the &s;aints, and for the di&s;play of his ju&s;tice, in the full de&s;truction of the ungodly. I now proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. That the ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in judgment. The propo&s;ition is fairly proved in the text. Peter gives us another proof, 2 Pet. iii.7.
<Q>The hea|vens and earth&mdash;are re&s;erved unto fire again&s;t the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.</Q>
Jude another, 14, 15, ver&s;es,
<Q>The Lord cometh&mdash; to execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly of their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed.</Q>
The&s;e are threat|nings of God, founded on the unchangeable perfec|tions of his nature: As God therefore is not man that he &s;hould lie, nor the &s;on of man that he &s;hould repent; &s;o &s;ure he will fulfil the threatnings of his word: Nothing then can be more plain, than that the ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in judgment. But fur|ther, to confirm and &s;et home a truth &s;o intere&s;ting and important, let me ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">I. The ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in judgment, be|cau&s;e they have not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law;
<PB N="11" REF="011973_0008_0F87CEAE1B0CBA78">
and &s;o being found guilty in the eye of the law, &s;trict and impartial ju&s;tice will not acquit, but will condemn them in judgment. The divine law is what God hath &s;tated as the rule of proceeding to|wards man.
<Q>Chri&s;t came not to de&s;troy, but to fulfil the law.</Q>
That man therefore may &s;tand in judgment, be acquitted, and find acceptance un|to eternal life, he mu&s;t have a righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the law requires, and will accept. What is the &s;aints &s;ecurity, that they &s;hall &s;tand in judgment? They have the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law. Not, that they imperfect &s;inful men ever did, or ever can in their own per&s;ons, an&s;wer the demands of the law: Nay, but this hath been fulfilled for them in the per&s;on of Chri&s;t their &s;urety; which law-fulfilling righteou&s;|ne&s;s hath been received by faith, placed to, and ac|cepted on their account. So though they are &s;aved by a new covenant, and by grace; yet they have a righteou&s;ne&s;s, which will an&s;wer the law; ju&s;tice will not then condemn, but will acquit them upon tryal. Can any ungodly &s;inner have any ju&s;t pre|tence to this righteou&s;ne&s;s? He is an unbeliever, and without Chri&s;t: He hath then no part in him, nor his righteou&s;ne&s;s. This is the only righteou&s;|ne&s;s, that will be accepted in judgment.</P>
<P>When therefore it is found upon fair tryal, that the ungodly hath not this, mu&s;t he not, when weighed in the balance, be found wanting? Yea, guilty in the eye of the law? Will not God then mark ini|quity again&s;t him? How then &s;hall he &s;tand? Strict and impartial ju&s;tice will require his blood. This is a rea&s;on, why men cannot &s;tand in human Courts of Judgment. They are not, upon a fair tryal, found righteous and innocent, but guilty in the eye of the
<PB N="12" REF="011973_0009_0F87CEAED8634558">
law. This being the ca&s;e, a righteous Jury cannot, in con&s;cience, ju&s;tify the guilty, and declare them innocent, but mu&s;t bring in their verdict guilty; and a ju&s;t Judge mu&s;t acquie&s;ce in their report, and pa&s;s the &s;entence accordingly. Let me ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">II. That the ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in judgment, becau&s;e the grand evidence improved before the judgment-&s;eat of God, will be their own practice or works; according to which evidence their &s;tate will be determined. The&s;e evidences will not be made u&s;e of to &s;ettle a determination in the mind of God, what the eternal &s;tate of the ungodly ought to be; but &s;uch a procedure will demon&s;trate to mens own con&s;ciences, and to the world the righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity of the final judgment Though there may be many witne&s;&s;es in the day of judgment, in order to inhance the condemnation of the ungodly, yet there will not need a train of witne&s;&s;es; for facts them&s;elves will be produced as evidences for or a|gain&s;t men, and there is no room left to di&s;pute plain matters of fact. This is according to the repre&s;en|tation which the Judge gives of his proceeding in the la&s;t judgment, Matt 25. latter end, where the &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;aints according to, though not for, their works; and the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon the ungodly, is according to their works. We have al&s;o a repre&s;entation of the la&s;t judgment, Rev. xx. 12, &amp;c. The dead are here &s;aid
<Q>to be judged out of tho&s;e things, which are written in the books, according to their works.</Q>
It is evident by this, that the deeds of the ungodly are all upon record in the book of God's omni&s;cience; that he will reveal them in the day of judgment, and make them re|vive in the book of the &s;inners own con&s;cience, as
<PB N="13" REF="011973_0010_0F87CEAF993FDE00">
well as manife&s;t them before the a&s;&s;embled world. When this is done, and by their deeds they are prov|ed ungodly, they fall in judgment. They cannot deny or extenuate their crimes before the judg|ment-&s;eat; they appear in their true and real light; they cannot have any objection again&s;t evidences &s;ummoned; they are their own deeds, which they will be convinced of: By the evidence then of their ungodly deeds, they will be condemned in judgment.</P>
<P>As in human Courts of ju&s;tice, it is the fact &s;ub&s;tantially proved again&s;t the criminal, for which he is condemned, and for which he dies: So un|godly deeds, produced as witne&s;&s;es again&s;t the un|godly in the final judgment, according to evidence, they mu&s;t fall inevitably, under the righteous con|demnation of God, and be ju&s;tly &s;entenced to death eternal, and have the ju&s;t &s;entence in its full length and breadth, depth and height, executed upon them. But,&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">III. The ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in judgment, becau&s;e they have no meet qualification to fit them for the pre&s;ence of the ju&s;t and holy Judge. They have no external righteou&s;ne&s;s to recommend them: Naked and guilty then, they cannot &s;tand before a ju&s;t and holy Judge, but mu&s;t fall with &s;hame and blu&s;hing confu&s;ion. They have no internal holi|ne&s;s, but are unrenewed, un&s;anctified and unholy, and &s;o have not the meet qualification to appear with Chri&s;t in judgment, and to &s;ee him as he is: "For without holine&s;s, no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." Holine&s;s is a qualification ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to fit men for the right hand of the Judge; for the
<PB N="14" REF="011973_0011_0F87CEB0641D48F8">
glory, holy &s;ociety, employments, entertainments and enjoyments of his heavenly kingdom. They &s;hall not &s;tand then in judgment, but will be &s;purned from the pre&s;ence of the Judge, and &s;entenced to dwell forever with the unclean, unholy and abomi|nable, in that fire never to be quenched.</P>
<P>Let us now attend to the APPLICATION. Hence,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. Is the certainty of a future and final judg|ment &s;o great, and the evidence &s;o full, that the ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in judgment; "what man|ner of per&s;ons ought we to be, in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s?" Though Chri&s;t hath wrought out a compleat redemption, and brought in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s; yet it is in vain for any to expect to appear with &s;afety in the day of God, unle&s;s they by faith receive Chri&s;t, with the benefits of his purcha&s;e; partake of his &s;pirit, and are holy, even as he is holy. To &s;tand in the final judgment is a matter of &s;uch everla&s;ting con&s;equence to the &s;ouls of men, that our call to be actually ready to &s;tand before the judgment-&s;eat, and to receive a &s;entence for eternity, is immediate and loud. Should not the &s;tate of our &s;ouls be &s;ettled and determined, without delay? Should not the light and evidence about our &s;afe appearing be &s;o bright and clear, as to put the matter out of all pre&s;ent doubt? Then &s;hall we be like the &s;ervant, that waits for his Lord's coming, and loves his appearing, and with him receive the ble&s;&s;ed euge and crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s. Permit me,</P>
<P N="2">2. To clo&s;e the Di&s;cour&s;e by way of Addre&s;s and Exhortation.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011973_0012_0F87CEB1190B9348">And now, with all &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;olemnity, I &s;hall fir&s;t take liberty to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you, <HI>unhappy Man!</HI> who are ju&s;t going to judgment, and to receive a particular &s;entence for eternity.&mdash; When I con&s;idered you as one of the precious &s;ouls committed to my charge; and as bearing a &s;pecial relation to a number of re&s;pectable families among my people, let me &s;ay, with trembling, I con&s;ented to prepare a final Sermon for you. Sen&s;ible of my great inability to deal with men in your &s;ituation, nature recoiled at the thought; and, had I con&s;ulted only the dictates of fle&s;h and blood, I mu&s;t have utterly refu&s;ed: But Providence called; with the call of Providence I complied; and at your own Election I come forth to &s;peak.</P>
<P>Permit me now, as a faithful watchman, in duty to God, and in compa&s;&s;ion to your &s;oul, to warn you of your danger, with all plainne&s;s, that having done my duty, I may &s;hake my raiment, and &s;ay, "I am pure from the blood of your &s;oul." Though it may, to you, po&s;&s;ibly &s;eem cruel to rehear&s;e over the evil deeds of a dying man, or reproachful; yet let me &s;ay, far be it from me, from having any de|&s;ire of &s;uch a nature: Any de&s;ire to reproach you, or to give your enemies occa&s;ion to rejoice in your mi&s;ery. Believe me, whatever I may &s;ay upon the evil of your conduct, &s;hall be with an hearty de&s;ign, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to bring you to a &s;en&s;e of the evil of your &s;ins, and to convince you of your immediate nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t, and his &s;alvation; knowing, "that the whole doth not &s;ee his need of a phy&s;ician, but he that is &s;ick."</P>
<P>And now were not you conceived in &s;in, and &s;hapen in iniquity? Are you not by nature a child
<PB N="16" REF="011973_0013_0F87CEB1DC3F5E78">
of wrath even as others, and an enemy to God by wicked works? Hath not your conduct been noto|riou&s;ly wicked? The character of the ungodly man in full; impious towards God, and unrighteous to|wards man, been your character? Have you not repented, there are but a few moments left you to reflect; to &s;ettle your accounts; to have your peace made with God, and to &s;eek preparation for a never|ending eternity! But to be particular, let me appeal to your con&s;cience in the &s;ight of that God, before whom you are pre&s;ently to appear, whether you have not, to an extreme degree, been guilty of the &s;in of intemperance? Have you not hereby di&s;ho|noured God, and abu&s;ed his bounty and goodne&s;s? wronged your own &s;oul and body? Wa&s;ted your &s;ub&s;tance? Brought your &s;elf and family to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s? Have you not followed this practice, until you became deaf to all warnings, regardle&s;s of all reproof, and even lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e and expecta|tion of death and judgment to come? Hath not this been an inlet to a train of evils of the blacke&s;t nature? A &s;ource of lying and profane &s;wearing? Abu&s;e and grief to your own parents? Abu&s;e to your own wife and children? A great grief and trial to your relatives and friends? Quarreling and con|tention with others? Know then, if you are not a very humble penitent indeed, God will not hold you guiltle&s;s at his righteous bar, nor &s;uffer you to inherit his kingdom; but will give you your portion in the lake of fire and brim&s;tone. Be&s;ides, by the ver|dict of the Jury, upon what I called, being pre&s;ent, a fair and impartial tryal; in the judgment of the Court and Judicious, that attended the tryal, with impartiality, you are verily guilty of the crying &s;in of MURDER. And let any friend to truth and

ju&s;tice but weigh with impartiality, the variety of reports you have your&s;elf made of the tragical af|fair; and how they will be able to pronounce you innocent, I cannot &s;ee. At one time you make report, that you was writing, and knew nothing of the affair;&mdash;again owned that you threw him down with your foot;&mdash;again owned that you did &s;eize him by the neck;&mdash;at other times report, that you was a&s;leep, and as ignorant about any thing done to the man decea&s;ed, as the child unborn: When it can be, and has to me been &s;ufficiently proved, that you was in reality awake. So many &s;hifts and fal&s;hoods argue guilt: For truth will bear its own weight, and is always con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. The&s;e things, with an evident di&s;po&s;ition to deny, conceal and extenuate other crimes of an at|trocious nature; together with the hand of provi|dence, appearing evidently to fru&s;trate every mea|&s;ure concerted for your help and e&s;cape, do not to me be&s;peak innocence, but guilt. To me, then, as a dying man, it appears, you ought to acknowledge the ju&s;tice of God and man, in your condemnation; and with David, &s;ay,
<Q>I acknow|ledge my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and my &s;in is ever before me.</Q>
With penitential brokenne&s;s, and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to God, &s;ay,
<Q>Again&s;t thee, and thee only, have I &s;inned, and done this evil in thy &s;ight: That thou mighte&s;t be ju&s;tified when thou &s;peake&s;t, and be clear when thou judge&s;t.</Q>
If a man be guilty, it is not the time to deny and plead not guilty, when he is going to the judg|ment-&s;eat of an all-&s;eeing Judge, to an&s;wer for his guilt. If you die in peace, you mu&s;t have a clear con&s;cience; a con&s;cience, void of offence towards God and man. Do you hope for acceptance at

the bar of God, die not concealing your guilt: For if you die with a guilty con&s;cience, and lyes in your mouth, you never will be renewed unto repentance, nor wa&s;hed in the Redeemer's blood: And unle&s;s you are in time wa&s;hed in the blood of Chri&s;t, and clothed in his righteou&s;ne&s;s, you will not have a righteou&s;ne&s;s in which you can, with &s;afety, appear before God; but your guilt, with all your evil works, appearing in judgment again&s;t you, in ju&s;tice, you cannot &s;tand. And con&s;ider, to day you are in a &s;tate of tryal, and there is a grain of hope yet left; if you now be|lieve in Chri&s;t, and repent of your &s;ins, you &s;hall have mercy.&mdash;Con&s;ider al&s;o, that to-day you mu&s;t appear before God, in judgment; and if found an impenitent in your &s;ins, you fall at once under an eternal cur&s;e without repeal, and the execution of it will immediately follow, and without any re|prieve for days. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Prince and Saviour, now &s;ets on a throne of grace, a &s;eat of mercy; But will you not this day find him on a throne of ju&s;tice? How then &s;hall you, a &s;inner by nature and practice, this day appear with &s;afety before a ju&s;t and holy Judge? Let me &s;ay if you find acceptance in judgment, you mu&s;t by faith receive Chri&s;t, the Prince and Saviour, and have his blood and merits, his law-fulfilling and magnifying righte|ou&s;ne&s;s transferred to you by a gracious imputati|on; otherwi&s;e, &s;o &s;ure as thou art now condemned by the law, &s;o &s;ure as thou ha&s;t already began to fall before ju&s;tice, &s;o &s;ure thou &s;halt not prevail, but &s;halt &s;urely fall before a ju&s;t and holy God.&mdash; And what an awful &s;tate is a long, long eternity of mi&s;ery! Your duty and bu&s;ine&s;s is now then to be deeply &s;en&s;ible of, and bewail your &s;ins of
<PB N="19" REF="011973_0016_0F87CEB5A7337620">
nature and practice, until you are truly &s;en&s;ible of your wretched, undone and helple&s;s condition, and ab&s;olute and immediate nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t, and &s;al|vation by him, that you may, under this convicti|on, e&s;&s;ay to commit your precious and immortal &s;oul into the hands of the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, in whom alone there is help found for lo&s;t &s;inners. You &s;hould be very earned for a true &s;ight of your pre&s;ent &s;tate, and plead with God in his abundant grace and goodne&s;s, to di&s;cover to you, an ill-de&s;erving and hell-de&s;erving &s;inner, the Saviour, as being &s;uited to all your wants, mi&s;eries and dangers; that he would give you a heart willing to renounce all other lords and lovers; all other hopes and dependencies; willing &s;incerely and in good earne&s;t, really to chu&s;e and embrace him as offered in the go&s;pel, and to venture your &s;oul wholly upon him for eternal life. You &s;hould plead that "Chri&s;t of God may be made unto you wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemp|tion;" that you may be found in him, having that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is through the faith of Chri&s;t, the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith: That as you are going to judgment this day, you may be introduced with acceptance before the Judge: So that though you die as a condemned criminal, yet being in Chri&s;t, you may be pardoned of God, and acquitted in the final judgment. You &s;hould plead for a true &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of &s;in, not merely as expo&s;ing you to public ju&s;tice, and the wrath of God, but as oppo&s;ite to the pure nature, odious and offen&s;ive in the &s;ight of a holy and merciful God, that you may loath and abhor it, and have that godly &s;orrow for &s;in, that worketh repentance unto life never to be repented of.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="011973_0017_0F87CEB944DFECC0">You &s;hould be earne&s;t for a heart to love God &s;upremely, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as one alto|gether lovely; for a heart to love the divine law, and to hate &s;in; to love and forgive your enemies, knowing that without the&s;e things, you mu&s;t be denied the pre&s;ence and glory of God in the com|ing world. And let me tell you, that the greate&s;t &s;inners are not &s;hut out from the &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings of the new covenant, if they will repent and be|lieve the go&s;pel. Not Mena&s;&s;ah, who filled the &s;treets of Jeru&s;alem with innocent blood&mdash;not the Jews, who crucified the Lord of glory&mdash;not the Gentiles, who were &s;laves to their lu&s;ts, and guilty of the mo&s;t abominable practices; gave them&s;elves up to work wickedne&s;s with all greedine&s;s: Free grace hath triumphed in the &s;alvation of &s;uch &s;in|ners as the&s;e. And it is now a faithful &s;aving, and worthy of all acceptation, "that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave the chief of &s;inners:" That "he who was dead, but is alive again, and ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion," is as able to &s;ave all that will come to God by him. Now then, poor Man! who have nothing to recom|mend you to God; no good works to boa&s;t of; who have been a great and notorious offender, let me bid you once more come under a &s;en&s;e of your &s;inful, mi&s;erable and helple&s;s e&s;tate; come &s;en&s;ible how infinitely ju&s;t God is, and will be, &s;hall he execute his wrath eternally upon you; come &s;en|&s;ible that there is help in the Lord, and &s;urrender your&s;elf up to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the mighty Prince and Saviour, and tru&s;t your &s;oul wholly upon his infi|nite merits for ju&s;tification and eternal life. His blood is all-&s;ufficient for the pardon of your great &s;ins, and can wa&s;h out your &s;tains of the longe&s;t

continuance. The Spirit of Chri&s;t can create a|new an old tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and fit you for heaven.&mdash; All things are po&s;&s;ible with God. The&s;e things, with the example of the dying thief, who obtain|ed mercy in the la&s;t hour, forbid you utterly to de&s;pair of &s;alvation. Art thou now a child of wrath, as you was born? Have you been an old tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and long &s;inned again&s;t light and love? long hardened your heart again&s;t coun&s;el and re|proof? But are you at la&s;t deeply &s;en&s;ible of your guilt? Are you inclined no longer to harden your neck, but to day&mdash;this la&s;t day, to hear the voice of God? Are you di&s;po&s;ed to be made a new crea|ture before you die, and to accept deliverance up|on the very borders of hell? With infinite ea&s;e Chri&s;t can deliver a dying &s;inner from death eter|nal. But now to pre&s;s all home, and to excite you immediately to comply with the in&s;tructions given, con&s;ider, if you are lo&s;t, what an awful account you will have to give to God, and how clear your con|demnation will be? Will not all the coun&s;els and in&s;tructions that ever you have had? Will not the mini&s;ters that have been dealing with you &s;ince un|der a &s;entence of death, with all their &s;olemn and weighty in&s;tructions, both in public and private, ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t you? Will not the go&s;pel, your own con&s;cience, and all your evil works, ri&s;e up again&s;t you, and aggravate your ju&s;t condemnation? If you now peri&s;h, better for you that you never had been born; better for you, that you had been executed on the day &s;entenced to die: For all the time given you, with all your re&s;pites, being &s;inned away, in&s;tead of being any benefit, hath only given you an opportunity to fill up the mea&s;ure of your iniquities, and to make an

intollerable hell &s;even times hotter. O for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and in mercy to your own &s;oul, I be&s;eech you to linger no longer, but fly from the wrath to come, to the city of refuge! As a pri&s;oner of hope, turn to the &s;trong hold. Flatter not your&s;elf that God is altogether &s;uch an one as your&s;elf: For he is a ju&s;t and an holy God. Deceive not your&s;elf, by thinking your&s;elf &s;omething, when you are nothing. Believe, unle&s;s you are in Chri&s;t, you cannot &s;tand in judgment. Know, unle&s;s you are born again, are a new creature, have all old things done away, and all things become anew, you cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Improve your few remain|ing moments in earne&s;t and importunate breathings of &s;oul, that God would &s;hew mercy to a dying &s;inner. In your la&s;t moments cry with the dying thief, "Lord Je&s;us, remember me in thy kingdom!' And &s;ay unto my poor &s;oul, "this day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e." What more can I &s;ay, but the Lord pity and have mercy on your &s;oul!&mdash;</P>

Let the dreadful example made of this poor crimi|nal, be a warning to men of intemperance, e&s;pecially to his own companions in wickedne&s;s. See the fruits of love to &s;trong drink! Let me lift up my voice, and cry aloud in the ears of all this &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly, Behold the dreadful effects of drinking to exce&s;s!&mdash; And O let the voice of this alarming example &s;ound in the ears of drunkards in accents of thunder, and deter you from your horrid practice, even as though you heard the trump of God &s;ound, and the voice of the Son of God, &s;aying, that the judgment of the wicked is come! Let this in&s;tance before us be a &s;olemn warning to men of pa&s;&s;ion, who in their pa&s;&s;ion quarrel and &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s. O lay hands on no man, le&s;t murder be committed, and you &s;hare in the fate of this poor man! Let young people take warning in &s;ea&s;on to guard again&s;t the &s;ins of intemperance and contention. Let the &s;olemn in&s;tance before us, with what we have this day heard, &s;ound an awakening alarm in the ears of every ungodly &s;inner. The &s;olemn, righteous, im|partial, critical, univer&s;al and final judgment, will come. The ungodly &s;hall appear, but &s;hall not &s;tand in judgment. O Sirs, above all things, be con|cerned about the weighty matter of death, judgment and eternity! Prepare without delay to meet your God, the great Judge of quick and dead. And now let us all in undi&s;&s;embled woe drop a tear upon this &s;orrowful occa&s;ion.</P>

Finally, let me caution all pre&s;ent upon this &s;orrowful occa&s;ion, to let your behaviour be with all decency and moderation. It is not a day for rioting and vain merriment.

Remember your need of grace to keep you from falling, and let him that &s;tandeth take heed le&s;t he fall. "And now may the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that great Shepherd of the &s;heep, through the blood of the everla&s;ting covenant, make us all perfect to do his will; working in us that which is well-plea&s;ing in his &s;ight, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t: To whom be glory forever and ever.
