<P>THAT I may &s;et the&s;e words before you in a ju&s;t light, and may at the &s;ame time improve them to the purpo&s;es of religion, I &s;hall go into the following method.</P>

<P>I &s;hall then apply the whole.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I am briefly to go over the whole &s;tory of which the text is a part.</P>
<P>Our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t was at this time on the cro&s;s, bearing the &s;ins of his people. To ca&s;t the greater reproach upon him, they crucified two thieves, the one on his right hand, the other on
<PB N="4" REF="012759_0004_0F94FA2E831B6CE8">
his left; thereby intimating that he was the mo&s;t enormous offender of the three. While the inhuman &s;pectators were deriding and in&s;ulting our Lord, "one of the malefactors railed on him, &s;aying, if thou be Chri&s;t, &s;ave thy&s;elf and us." The evangeli&s;t Mat|thew &s;peaks in the plural number, and &s;o doth Mark, "They that were crucified with him, reviled him." From whence many expo&s;itors &s;uppo&s;e, that the thief, who afterwards expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with &s;uch penitence and faith, at fir&s;t joined in this opprobrious and impious language; but it is more probable, that the plural number is put for the &s;ingular in tho&s;e e|vangeli&s;ts, an hebrai&s;m frequently u&s;ed in the &s;acred writings,<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">They who de&s;ire to &s;ee in&s;tances of this may con&s;ult <HI>Dod|dridge, Macknight, Gay&s;e,</HI> and others.</NOTE> and that we are to receive the account given by Luke as the mo&s;t exact repre&s;entation; "<HI>One</HI> of the malefactors railed on him."</P>
<P>"But the other an&s;wering, rebuked him, &s;aying, do&s;t not thou fear God, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condemnation? and we indeed ju&s;tly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing ami&s;s." Do&s;t not thou fear God, when thou art ju&s;t going to give an account of the things done in the body before his awful bar? Do&s;t thou dare to add to the enormities of thy former life, the guilt of in&s;ulting one who is like thy&s;elf &s;entenced to die, and feels the &s;ame cruel tortures to which we are condem|ned. And as for our puni&s;hment it is ju&s;t. Our crimes de&s;erve all the infamy and di&s;tre&s;s to which we are re|duced; but this is an innocent man, who is only a vic|tim to envy and malice; he hath not done any thing ami&s;s, he ju&s;tly claims the character of Me&s;&s;iah, tho' he doth not vouch&s;afe to give that proof of it which you in&s;olently demand, and though he is now &s;uffer|ing as a criminal with us.&mdash;Thus this poor malefactor, when he could do it in no other way, gives glory to God by confe&s;&s;ing his &s;ins, and acknowledging the
<PB N="5" REF="012759_0005_0F94FA2FE363E408">
ju&s;tice of the puni&s;hment which he now &s;uffered; and at the &s;ame time confe&s;&s;es Je&s;us Chri&s;t, though he &s;aw him in the mo&s;t humble circum&s;tances, "obedi|ent to death, even the death of the cro&s;s."</P>
<P>"And he &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom." We &s;carce find &s;uch an in&s;tance of faith in the whole book of God! Our Lord had been condemned by the Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim and the Roman Governor, he was now &s;uffering as a malefactor, he was de&s;erted by his own di&s;ciples, reviled by the rulers and teachers of the people; his external appearance was more like a &s;lave than like a Prince and a Saviour; yet, under all the&s;e ignominious circum&s;tances, this criminal owns him as his Lord, believes that he had a kingdom beyond the grave, and looks to him for &s;alvation in the future world.</P>
<P>Some have been very &s;ollicitous to find out how this thief came to the knowledge of Chri&s;t, &s;o as to own his exalted character, and &s;ubmit to him as Lord and Chri&s;t. Knowledge nece&s;&s;arily precedes faith. "How &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" But though he was a thief, he might have had frequent opportunities of hearing Chri&s;t, before he was apprehended by authority; if not, he might have heard of him from others, for the fame of Je&s;us, of his per&s;on, his preten&s;ions, and his mira|cles, went through all the country; the &s;ight of Je&s;us would naturally bring the&s;e things to mind; he might be affected with our Lord's patience under his &s;uffer|ings, and his meekne&s;s towards tho&s;e who in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed him; and the Spirit of God might, by his &s;ecret energy, give him a new and transforming view of truths he had formerly heard with indifference, perhaps with contempt. It &s;eems as if he mu&s;t have known &s;omething of our Lord's character, or he could not have borne that te&s;timony to his innocence, "this
<PB N="6" REF="012759_0006_0F94FA3062626610">
man hath done nothing ami&s;s." But allowing that this criminal had never heard of Je&s;us before, he heard enough this day, even from his enemies, to teach him, that our Lord a&s;&s;umed the character of the Me&s;&s;iah who was to come into the world, for they expre&s;ly upbraided him with pretending to be the Chri&s;t, the cho&s;en of God; and having, probably, been educated in the Jewi&s;h religion, he was acquainted with the ancient prophecies, and the general expecta|tion there was of the advent of the Me&s;&s;iah; and from the excellent &s;pirit which our Lord exhibited, and the very cruel and wicked temper di&s;covered by tho&s;e who attended his crucifixion, he might conclude that for envy they had delivered him; and this evidence pre&s;ented to one, brought, by divine influence, to a happy ingenuity of temper, and readine&s;s of mind to embrace truth, might be a rational foundation of faith. E&s;pecially, if to all the re&s;t was added the preterna|tural darkne&s;s &s;poken of in the next ver&s;e, and which &s;ome think was now begun. Whether we embrace one or the other of the&s;e opinions, the hi&s;tory menti|ons no expre&s;&s;ion of regard to Chri&s;t, till the other thief railed on him; we may therefore rea&s;onably con|clude that he never had believed till now: Convinced by our Lord's piety and goodne&s;s in &s;uch a trying &s;ituation, and by the miraculous circum&s;tances which attended him, he addre&s;&s;es him in the language of a mo&s;t noble and vigorous faith. "Lord, remem|ber me, when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom." Nor is his faith more to be ob&s;erved than his mode&s;ty; the di&s;ciples James and John, or their ambitious mother for them, petitioned that they might &s;it, the one on the right hand, and the other on the left, in his king|dom, they could not be content without high prefer|ment. But this thief doth not &s;oar &s;o high; as he had more ju&s;t notions of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, &s;o he had more low thoughts of him&s;elf. "Lord, remember me," is his humble reque&s;t. Let me not be ca&s;t out&mdash;Let me be admitted, even when thou come&s;t&mdash;I a&s;k
<PB N="7" REF="012759_0007_0F94FA328F2234E0">
no more&mdash;a&s;&s;ign me the lowe&s;t place&mdash;it is enough&mdash;this is as much as I can hope for&mdash;it is infinitely more than I de&s;erve.&mdash;This was the prayer of this remarka|ble penitent, full of faith and humility, and thus did divine grace triumph over the malice and wickedne&s;s of our Lord's enemies.&mdash;But I come now to the</P>
<P>Second thing propo&s;ed, which was to explain the an&s;wer of our Lord to the reque&s;t made him by the penitent believing thief. "And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, verily I &s;ay unto thee, To-day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e."</P>
<P>Here are three things which need particular illu&s;|tration.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We are to enquire what we are to under&s;tand by <HI>paradi&s;e,</HI> into which Chri&s;t promi&s;es this humble penitent an admi&s;&s;ion. The word originally &s;ignifies a plea&s;ant and delightful garden, and therefore the place where Adam re&s;ided before his apo&s;tacy was called paradi&s;e by the Jews. It may properly be u&s;ed for any place of delight; in our text it intends the receptacle of the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, in the intermediate &s;tate, or during their &s;eparati|on from the body. To this ble&s;&s;ed place the apo&s;|tle Paul tells us he was caught up.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 12. 4.</NOTE> This para|di&s;e, many learned men &s;uppo&s;e, is di&s;tinct from the third heaven to which the apo&s;tle was al&s;o taken up,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;e 2.</NOTE> and where God hath fixed his throne, and di&s;plays his glory more illu&s;triou&s;ly than he doth any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>The next thing to be explained in the words, is what our Saviour intends when he &s;ays, "Thou &s;halt be <HI>with me</HI> in paradi&s;e." This pa&s;&s;age is a full con|futation of that ab&s;urd opinion, which &s;ome of the ancients entertained, that Chri&s;t de&s;cended into hell the place of the damned. When our Saviour &s;ays by
<PB N="8" REF="012759_0008_0F94FA3351396898">
the Spirit of prophecy, "Thou wilt not leave my &s;oul in hell," the expre&s;&s;ion intends no more than that God would not leave him in the &s;tate of the dead. And &s;o we mu&s;t interpret that pa&s;&s;age in the creed called the apo&s;tle's, "he de&s;cended into hell," if we receive it at all. Whatever they intended who fir&s;t added it, this clau&s;e cannot be under&s;tood in any other &s;en&s;e con&s;i&s;t|ent with truth, than that his &s;oul went into the invi&s;i|ble world, where the &s;pirits of the &s;aints remain in a &s;eparate &s;tate, waiting for the redemption of the bo|dy. When therefore our Lord &s;ays to the penitent thief, "this day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e," he intends that his &s;eparate &s;pirit &s;hould be in that place to which he was going him&s;elf. To be with Chri&s;t con&s;titutes the happine&s;s of the &s;aints.</P>
<P>The third thing I propo&s;ed to explain is that ex|pre&s;&s;ion, "<HI>To day</HI> &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e." This phra&s;e intimates that his &s;oul &s;hould immediate|ly pa&s;s into glory; that it &s;hould neither be in a place of &s;ilence and inactivity, nor &s;hould de&s;cend to a place allotted to purge and purify it.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to the third general head, which is to take notice of &s;everal profitable le&s;&s;ons which we are taught in this an&s;wer of our Saviour's to the penitent thief. Here</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We ob&s;erve the a&s;toni&s;hing goodne&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He heard the in&s;ults and re|proaches of his enemies with the mo&s;t profound &s;i|lence, not a word proceeded from him in an&s;wer to their invectives; but no &s;ooner doth this humble pe|nitent apply to him, than he attends to the voice of his &s;upplication, and tho' he was him&s;elf conflicting with the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and torture, he vouch&s;afes to give him a gracious an&s;wer. The reque&s;t was, "Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom." Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour doth not in return reproach him
<PB N="9" REF="012759_0009_0F94FA3418A3D898">
with his former crimes, with his impenitence and ob|duracy under the means of grace with which he had been favored; he doth not tell him, it was too late for him to hope for mercy, after having led &s;uch a wick|ed life. He doth not reject him, becau&s;e he had not believed in him before, or becau&s;e he was ju&s;t now expiring, and &s;o could have no opportunity of te&s;ti|fying his regard to him in the world. No!&mdash;Our Lord knew the change which divine grace had wrought in him&mdash;he &s;aw with infinite compa&s;&s;ion the penitence and remor&s;e which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his &s;oul&mdash;he knew that his profe&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect and homage were &s;incere&mdash;and that in his heart he &s;ubmitted to him as con&s;titu|ted Mediator between God and man: He therefore owned him as a di&s;ciple, and for his &s;upport and com|fort, gave him the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance of happine&s;s af|ter death. The humble &s;uppliant a&s;ks, "Lord, re|member me when thou come&s;t in thy kingdom," Chri&s;t an&s;wers, "This day thou &s;halt be with me in paradi&s;e." Upon which Grotius ob&s;erves, that our Lord promi&s;es more than was a&s;ked. It is as if he had &s;aid, "Thou ha&s;t reque&s;ted, that I would re|member you when I take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my kingdom, I will not &s;o long delay the de&s;ires of thine heart: but will grant a part&mdash;&s;ome fir&s;t-fruits of the happine&s;s you hope for, this very day: You &s;hall die &s;afe, and immediately after death divine plea&s;ures await you." Wonderful goodne&s;s! Such as could proceed from none but him who is goodne&s;s it&s;elf!</P>
<P>Secondly, In what dignity doth our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t appear! and with what exten&s;ive dominion is he ve&s;ted! "This day thou &s;halt be with me in pa|radi&s;e." He &s;peaks like a King; like a King upon his throne. Hanging on a cro&s;s, attended with every cir|cum&s;tance of infamy and di&s;tre&s;s, with what authority and maje&s;ty doth he "not only undertake to di&s;pen&s;e pardons, but to di&s;po&s;e of &s;eats in paradi&s;e!" If he
<PB N="10" REF="012759_0010_0F94FA34C7BF2780">
had this power in his dying agonies, as undoubtedly he had; how readily &s;hould we receive his declaration &s;ince he aro&s;e from the dead, "all power is given un|to me, in heaven, and in earth." Our once crucified Lord is exalted above all principalities and powers, and hath authority to give eternal life to whom&s;oever he will. So much &s;eems to be intended in that de&s;|cription which He gives of him&s;elf,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 1. 18.</NOTE> "I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of Hades and of death." Under the word <HI>Hades</HI> is included the whole invi&s;ible world, the &s;eat of the ble&s;&s;ed, as well as the pri&s;on of the damned&mdash;The paradi&s;e of God, as well as hell the place of puni&s;hment. Of this invi&s;ible world Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath the keys, i. e. he hath full power and authority to a&s;&s;ign to both the righte|ous and the wicked, their &s;eparate and very different apartments. "He openeth and no man &s;hutteth, and &s;hutteth and no man openeth."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 3. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thirdly, We may ob&s;erve from our Saviour's an&s;|wer to this penitent malefactor, that the &s;ouls of the righteous do immediately pa&s;s into a &s;tate of ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s. That this was the happy ca&s;e with the thief, we have already &s;uppo&s;ed to be implied in our text; and can any one think that this was a privilege peculiar to him? That this man was honored in this re&s;pect above Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob, Mo&s;es, and the other patriarchs and prophets? Did the &s;oul &s;leep with the body, would the apo&s;tle Paul have been at all in a &s;trait which he &s;hould chu&s;e, whether to depart or to abide in the fle&s;h? Would not any chri&s;tian chu&s;e to glorify God, however imperfectly, in this world; ra|ther than be ab&s;olutely incapable of glorifying him at all? Why doth Stephen with holy joy call upon Je|&s;us to receive his &s;pirit, if he was ju&s;t going to leave a &s;tate of active &s;ervice for a &s;tate of &s;ilence and inacti|vity? Why does our Saviour repre&s;ent the &s;oul of
<PB N="11" REF="012759_0011_0F94FA358CD18E20">
Lazarus, as taken into Abraham's bo&s;om, and retain|ing a power of action, if &s;eparate &s;pirits are in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility? It is ob&s;ervable, that, at this very time, when Lazarus is &s;poken of as in a &s;tate of hap|pine&s;s and enjoyment, the rich man is repre&s;ented as in torments, and his brethren as alive and in a pro|bation &s;tate. It is however plain from the &s;acred &s;criptures, that the &s;ouls of the righteous do not en|joy that compleat happine&s;s, while di&s;united from the body, which they will afterwards. When Chri&s;t comes to judgment he will reward men according to their works. Then will he &s;ay to the righteous, "Come ye ble&s;&s;ed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you:"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 25. 34.</NOTE> this plainly implies that they were not in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of it before; and therefore the apo&s;tle, when he &s;peaks of tho&s;e who "look for the ble&s;&s;ed hope," con|nects with it "the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. 2. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>Fourthly, This in&s;tance of the mercy and grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is an argument again&s;t de&s;pair of the mercy of God. The greate&s;t, the olde&s;t offen|ders, have from hence encouragement, though not to delay their repentance, yet to repent in hope of their obtaining mercy: Here was one who had been an enormous &s;inner, and continued, for aught that ap|pears, impenitent, till he was actually &s;u&s;pended on the cro&s;s, and within a few hours of death; yet, even this wretched &s;inner, upon his application to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, finds mercy. Surely then none need to de&s;pair, but all ought to repair to this merciful High-Prie&s;t, who is now highly exalted, to grant repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins; and who&s;e precious blood clean|&s;eth from all &s;in. There is no rea&s;on to be given, why the greate&s;t and mo&s;t obdurate &s;inner, who is brought to &s;ubmit to the Saviour and Redeemer of men, may not expect pardon and acceptance. If &s;uch &s;inners are excluded under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, if
<PB N="12" REF="012759_0012_0F94FA36529EE050">
there are any of who&s;e &s;alvation there is no po&s;&s;i|bility; it mu&s;t be, either becau&s;e the merits of Chri&s;t are not &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e redemption for them, or el&s;e becau&s;e they are excluded from the benefit of what he hath done and &s;uffered, by the expre&s;s decla|ration of God. As for the fir&s;t of the&s;e, &s;urely none will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the merits of Chri&s;t are not &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e pardon for the greate&s;t and vi|le&s;t offender that ever lived. As he is an infinite per|&s;on, &s;o what he did, as our &s;urety, is of infinite worth and value, enough to an&s;wer all the demands of the law, and to procure a right to all the ble&s;&s;ings he un|dertook to purcha&s;e. If any then are excluded the benefit of Chri&s;t's mediatorial tran&s;actions, it is not on account of any deficiency in what he hath done and &s;uffered; it mu&s;t be by an explicit declaration. They mu&s;t be excepted, if not by name, yet by de&s;cription, from the general offers of pardon and &s;alvation, or they have no warrant to except them&s;elves&mdash;no rea&s;on to de&s;pair of mercy, or to determine that they are ei|ther too great or too old &s;inners to be forgiven. But where do we find &s;uch exceptions in the word of God? Where is it &s;aid, that none &s;hall partake of the bene|fits purcha&s;ed by Chri&s;t, who&s;e &s;ins have amounted to &s;uch a degree, or who have continued &s;o long in them? On the contrary, are not the invitations of the go&s;pel made to all without exception? "Come unto me," &s;ays our Lord, "all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you re&s;t."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 11. 28.</NOTE> "Who&s;oever will, let him take of the water of life freely."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 22. 17.</NOTE> "If any man thir&s;t, let him come."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John 7. 37.</NOTE> Are not the promi&s;es made ab&s;olutely to every one that believeth?

the hope of obtaining faith and repentance, and con|&s;equently pardon and &s;alvation, but they who commit the &s;in again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, which our Saviour tells us "&s;hall not be forgiven." All other kinds of &s;in have been, and may be pardoned. We find &s;ome of the greate&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors have been received to mercy. Such was Mana&s;&s;eh, who filled Jeru&s;alem with innocent blood. Such were the Corinthians, ac|cording to the account the apo&s;tle Paul gives of them, in their heathen &s;tate. And &s;uch have been a multi|tude of others, whom God hath called by his grace. Such was the thief on the cro&s;s; and yet our Saviour doth not in the lea&s;t he&s;itate to a&s;&s;ure him of pardon after death, upon his expre&s;&s;ing his faith and repen|tance. And we are hereby taught, to u&s;e the words of another, "that no impurities of life, though ne|ver &s;o foul, no crimes, though never &s;o black, never &s;o numerous, &s;hut us out from mercy, provided we &s;incerely repent; that the grace of God can recover wretches, even when they are at the la&s;t ga&s;p, and ju&s;t dropping into everla&s;ting torments. Repentance, when true, is never too late, and therefore the thief upon the cro&s;s is a &s;overeign <HI>antidote</HI> again&s;t <HI>de&s;pair.</HI>" But it is a mo&s;t horrible abu&s;e of this doctrine, for any to encourage them&s;elves in &s;in, from this in&s;tance of the grace of God; and to defer their repentance, be|cau&s;e this man found mercy in his la&s;t hours. "As to actual repentance it&s;elf, and &s;uch grace being ex|tended to tho&s;e (when they come to death's door) who have been profligate and habitual &s;inners all their days, the mo&s;t that can be inferred from hence is, that &s;uch a thing <HI>may</HI> be, but it gives us no manner of &s;e|curity, nor &s;o much as one po&s;&s;ible argument that it certainly <HI>&s;hall</HI> be. Men may out&s;tay the day of grace, God may deny them both the will and the power to repent; and therefore this example, when truly con&s;idered, is an excellent <HI>pre&s;ervative</HI> again&s;t <HI>pre|&s;umption.</HI>"&mdash;But this brings me to the</P>
<P>Fourth propo&s;ition, which is to &s;how, that there is
<PB N="14" REF="012759_0014_0F94FA3BC3879468">
no rea&s;on, from this in&s;tance, for any to pre&s;ume on the mercy of God, &s;o as to neglect, or defer their re|pentance. There are &s;o many circum&s;tances which make this an extraordinary ca&s;e, that it mu&s;t be the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible madne&s;s and folly, to rea&s;on from this example, in favor of &s;inners who delay their repen|tance to the la&s;t moment. This, indeed, &s;hews that God can convert &s;inners even in a dying hour, and &s;o long as &s;uch an exertion of divine power and grace is po&s;&s;ible, none ought to de&s;pair. But there is a va&s;t medium between de&s;pair and pre&s;umption, and ac|cording to the common cour&s;e of divine grace, there is but little rea&s;on to entertain hopes of tho&s;e, who a|bu&s;e this triumph of the mercy and goodne&s;s of God, to embolden them&s;elves in impiety and vice, and on|ly cry to God for mercy, when they can &s;in no longer. To prevent &s;uch a vain confidence, I &s;hall ob&s;erve &s;everal things, which ought, in all rea&s;on, to keep us from &s;uch a mi&s;improvement of this affecting and u&s;e|ful &s;tory.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, This is a &s;ingle example. I do not mean that there never was another in&s;tance, of a &s;inner's ob|taining mercy in a dying moment; God knows how many more there may have been. But there is no other recorded in the book of God; and therefore there is no other that we can be po&s;itive about. And what color of rea&s;on is there to conclude, that we &s;hall ob|tain the grace of repentance becau&s;e one man did, when &s;o many have gone out of the world in an im|penitent &s;tate. We do not conduct thus in other mat|ters. For in&s;tance, we are told, that Mithridates king of Pontus, had, by a con&s;tant u&s;e of antidotes, ren|dered him&s;elf proof again&s;t all kinds of poi&s;on, that he could drink the large&s;t potion without any &s;en&s;i|ble ill effect: Would any one, becau&s;e a &s;ingle man had attained to &s;uch &s;ecurity, venture to take a do&s;e of poi&s;on, upon the pre&s;umption that it would not af|fect him, when it is known what an awful effect it
<PB N="15" REF="012759_0015_0F94FA3DB22D2760">
hath had upon others; and that it hath brought mul|titudes to a mo&s;t tragical end? No!&mdash;men act more cautiou&s;ly where this life is in danger. Alas! Why do we forget all caution, where the life of our preci|ous and immortal &s;ouls is concerned, which is of infi|nitely greater importance? Why &s;hould we encou|rage our&s;elves from the in&s;tance of the penitent thief to neglect our &s;ouls, any more than we do to expo&s;e our&s;elves to temporal danger, becau&s;e others have e&s;|caped, when in &s;imilar circum&s;tances?</P>
<P>Secondly, The penitent thief was an extraordinary in&s;tance of faith. Our Lord was, at this time, in the depths of his humiliation, he was dying on a cro&s;s, and in &s;uch circum&s;tances of infamy and di&s;tre&s;s, that even his own di&s;ciples &s;eemed to que&s;tion, whether this was he who was to deliver I&s;rael. But while in &s;uch a di&s;graceful &s;ituation, this condemned malefactor acknowledges him to be a King, owns him as the Me&s;|&s;iah, implores his favor, and carries his views to that &s;piritual kingdom, which, as one ob&s;erves, "fle&s;h and blood and human rea&s;on could never have di&s;covered; a kingdom, which no eye, but the eye of faith could have ever perceived, and which even they, who had enjoyed the advantage of three years in&s;truction and conver&s;ation, never yet perfectly under&s;tood. This was a confe&s;&s;ion &s;o re&s;olute, &s;o &s;ingular, &s;o illu&s;trious, that no preacher, no apo&s;tle, no martyr ever came up to the heightening commendations of it; none gave &s;o ample a te&s;timony to the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, becau&s;e none had this peculiar excellence, of giving it under &s;o many di&s;advantageous and di&s;couraging circum|&s;tances." His faith is yet more illu&s;trious, if, as mo&s;t expo&s;itors &s;uppo&s;e, he had not heard of Chri&s;t before, but embraced the fir&s;t opportunity he ever had of confe&s;&s;ing him.&mdash;What pretence can wicked and ungodly men under the go&s;pel have, to draw this ex|ample into a precedent, to &s;upport their pre&s;umption and ob&s;tinate continuance in &s;in? Can they make
<PB N="16" REF="012759_0016_0F94FA3DDB924210">
the ca&s;e of a man, who, perhaps, never heard of Chri&s;t, or only tran&s;iently, and who owned him when every one el&s;e for&s;ook him, a parallel to their's, who have all their days &s;at under the light and preaching of the glorious go&s;pel, and have refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to this ex|cellent Saviour, now the reproach of the cro&s;s is &s;o ef|fectually rolled away, and he is declared to be the Son of God with power, by his re&s;urrection from the dead? Why &s;hould a delaying &s;inner take encouragement from this example of the thief, unle&s;s he were &s;ure of having the &s;ame ingenuity of mind that he had? It is not, in|deed, to be expected, that every &s;incere convert &s;hould attain to the &s;ame eminent degree of faith to which he aro&s;e; no doubt, the lea&s;t degree of a holy regard to Je&s;us Chri&s;t will be accepted. But as it was very extraordinary in this man to profe&s;s Chri&s;t under &s;uch peculiar circum&s;tances; &s;o it is very uncommon for one who has been carele&s;s and profligate in his life, to find a heart to repent, and to re&s;ign him&s;elf up to Chri&s;t in his la&s;t moments. 'Tis true, nothing is too hard for omnipotent grace, but the enquiry is not what God <HI>can</HI> do, but what, according to his word, and his u&s;ual method of dealing with &s;inners, we may rea&s;onably expect he <HI>will</HI> do; and according to the&s;e rules, we cannot look upon the extraordinary ca&s;e in our text, as e&s;tabli&s;hing a precedent for common and ordinary ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Thirdly, This was an extraordinary time, &s;uch as will never be again. The Lord of glory was expiring on a cro&s;s; it was &s;itting, that, at &s;uch a time, there &s;hould be &s;ome illu&s;trious trophy of divine power and grace. What &s;ingular glory doth the conver&s;ion of this &s;inner reflect on our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? By this he evidenced his &s;uperiority to the powers of earth and hell, though he &s;aw fit to yield, for a time, to their malice. In this his mo&s;t humble &s;tate, he, as it were, led captivity captive, by re&s;cuing a &s;oul of which Sa|tan doubtle&s;s &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ecure. The other
<PB N="17" REF="012759_0017_0F94FA3F3B36B8D0">
malefactor &s;ays to our Lord with an air of in&s;olent contempt, "If thou be Chri&s;t, &s;ave thy&s;elf and us." Our Lord could ea&s;ily have done this and much more, but how then would the &s;criptures have been fulfill|ed, that thus it mu&s;t be? But though our Lord did not come down from the cro&s;s, to an&s;wer the demand of this hardened wretch, he exerted his power in a manner much more worthy of him&s;elf, and agreably to the great de&s;ign of his coming into the world; he bowed his companion's heart, and &s;aved him from the wrath which is to come. But what encouragement can this afford to delaying &s;inners? can they &s;uppo&s;e that the Son of God will again de&s;cend from heaven and die upon the cro&s;s? and if &s;uch a time and &s;uch circum&s;tances are never likely to come again, &s;urely, no one can argue, with any degree of certainty, that he &s;hall become a true penitent, becau&s;e this was the happy ca&s;e with the thief, for who&s;e conver&s;ion there was &s;uch an extraordinary rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I might go on, and ob&s;erve the folly and perver&s;e|ne&s;s of tho&s;e who encourage them&s;elves in delays from this example, as it is dreadfully uncertain, whether they &s;hall have an opportunity, in their expiring mo|ments, to repent and commit them&s;elves into the hands of the Redeemer. Many are &s;natched &s;udden|ly into the eternal world. Many are deprived of rea&s;on by the force of the di&s;ea&s;e with which they are vi&s;ited. Others are &s;tupid and in&s;en&s;ible with re&s;pect to &s;piritual and eternal things. But the time calls me to the Improvement of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, From what we have heard we are led to a|dore the &s;overeignty of divine grace. By &s;overeignty, I do not intend that God ever acts without the exer|ci&s;e of wi&s;dom: An infinitely wi&s;e Being mu&s;t always have the highe&s;t rea&s;on for what he does. Nor dare I &s;ay, that he hath no regard to any di&s;po&s;ition in us,
<PB N="18" REF="012759_0018_0F94FA3F649D1F88">
when he confers pardon and happine&s;s. But he is not accountable to any of his creatures, nor doth he al|ways be&s;tow his favors on tho&s;e we &s;hould think mo&s;t proper to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, nor in the time and way we &s;hould expect: The Lord &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth, nor are his ways our ways. Behold a mi&s;erable malefac|tor exerci&s;ing true repentance in his dying moments, and received into favor, while the learned Scribes and Phari&s;ees, the rulers and teachers of the people, are left impenitent and unpardoned! The boi&s;terous, inhu|man jailor believes and is &s;aved; but the hopeful young ruler, who acco&s;ted our Saviour with &s;o much re&s;pect, enquiring with great &s;eeming earne&s;tne&s;s, and in the prime and vigor of life, about the way of &s;alva|tion, went away &s;orrowful! According to our view of things, a malefactor condemned to die for his enor|mous crimes would be the mo&s;t unlikely to be &s;av|ed, but Chri&s;t makes him an eminent example of di|vine grace. "God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth." And that which makes the &s;overeignty of God the more ob&s;er|vable, in this in&s;tance, is, the di&s;tinction made between the two criminals. Nothing appears but that they were equal in their guilt, they had been perhaps part|ners in their crimes, as they were con&s;igned to the &s;ame puni&s;hment: But behold one is taken, and the other left! One remains hardened in his impiety, the other is melted into contrition and the mo&s;t ingenu|ous &s;orrow! It was the God of all grace who made them to differ. He, by his almighty energy, &s;ubdued the heart of the one, and made him &s;uch an illu&s;tri|ous penitent; while the other breathed out bla&s;phe|mies and reproaches again&s;t the Son of God, and was left to peri&s;h in his &s;ins. The one hath infinite rea|&s;on to adore the wonderful grace extended to him, the other cannot complain of inju&s;tice, he received but the ju&s;t reward of his doings. And we have all rea&s;on to adore the &s;overeignty of God, in &s;hewing mercy to one and leaving the other.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="012759_0019_0F94FA40136C07D8">
Secondly, How unrea&s;onable and dangerous is their conduct, who take encouragement from the thief upon the cro&s;s, to delay their repentance! This in|&s;tance, you &s;ee, is every way extraordinary; and therefore cannot, with the lea&s;t &s;hadow of rea&s;on, be taken as a precedent, or &s;pecimen of God's common method of dealing with &s;inners. It may, indeed, with rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed, that there have been others, who re&s;embled this thief in the &s;incerity of their repentance, as they have been like him in the latene&s;s of it, whom God hath received to his mercy; but have we not rea&s;on to fear, that the repentance of mo&s;t, when they apprehend them&s;elves in dying circum&s;tances, is hy|pocritical and deceitful, extorted only by the terrors of an awakened con&s;cience, and the fear of eternal mi&s;ery? Though we are to hope the be&s;t concern|ing particular per&s;ons, yet if we judge by examples, can we judge very favorably of death bed repentan|ces? If we examine the after conduct of tho&s;e, who have been rai&s;ed from the gates of death, and who, in that &s;ituation, have appeared with the &s;tronge&s;t marks of humility and penitence; how very rare is it to find any, upon whom the impre&s;&s;ions of religion have been abiding! With re&s;pect to the mo&s;t," it hath happen|ed unto them according to the true proverb, the dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire." And it de&s;erves particular notice, that even at this extraordi|nary time, when our Saviour was dying on the cro&s;s, though he had mercy on one of tho&s;e who were cru|cified with him, yet he left the other in a &s;tate of blindne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility. The one is, as it were, hung up a monument of vengeance, the other is &s;et up as a trophy of the Redeemer's victory over the Prince of darkne&s;s. There is as much rea&s;on that the one &s;hould awaken us to the greate&s;t attention and di|ligence, as that the other &s;hould encourage us to hope in the mercy and grace of God. Yea, as an attention to the great things of religion is every one's immedi|ate

duty, and will be followed with un&s;peakable ad|vantage, and as delays in this ca&s;e are extremely dan|gerous, we ought to improve this whole narration, as an argument to repentance, in&s;tead of abu&s;ing it to harden our&s;elves, again&s;t the methods of in&s;truction, with which an infinitely merciful God is plea&s;ed to favor us.</P>
<P>Let us then be excited to repair to our ble&s;&s;ed Re|deemer for pardon and &s;alvation. Let none neglect it, &s;eeing it is a matter of the greate&s;t importance. Let none defer it, &s;eeing life is uncertain, and opportunity may cea&s;e. Let none give way to dejection and de&s;|pair, however great and aggravated their &s;ins have been: You &s;ee God can extend mercy to &s;uch as you, in a con&s;i&s;tency with the perfection of his nature, and the dignity of his government; and &s;o long as he can, who can &s;ay but he will? Your ca&s;e is hazardous, it may not be de&s;perate. The merits of Chri&s;t are &s;uf|ficient to atone for the greate&s;t offences, there have been in&s;tances of great &s;inners becoming great peni|tents, there is no declaration in the word that ex|cludes you from hope. There can be no rea&s;on for pre&s;umption, or for continuance in an evil cour&s;e, but there is great encouragement to be found in the way of duty. It is your be&s;t, your wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e to wait upon God, in the ways of his appointment, who can tell but he may hear the voice of your &s;upplication, have mercy upon you, and &s;ave you? Your ca&s;e is par|ticularly hopeful, if you are rou&s;ed to a deep concern and &s;ollicitude about your eternal &s;tate. Let your ca&s;e be what it will, your &s;ins &s;mall or great, many or few, the direction of the go&s;pel is, "If any man thir&s;t let him come to me;" and the merciful declaration is, "Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out."</P>

With what holy joy, will you con|template the wonders of redeeming love! and prai&s;e the God of all grace, even for tho&s;e ignominious &s;uffer|ings, which through his infinite mercy, have been made to prepare you for a ble&s;&s;ed immortality! This, <HI>poor condemned criminal!</HI> is the happine&s;s which the go&s;pel reveals. This is the happine&s;s we &s;incerely wi&s;h you; and which it is po&s;&s;ible for you, who have &s;uch a heavy load of guilt upon you, to attain. And will you not, with uncea&s;ing im|portunity, pray, that God would thus glorify the riches of his grace towards you? Is there no danger that you will mi&s;s of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which the go&s;pel reveals? I mu&s;t faithfully tell you, there is. While with plea&s;ure I repeat that gracious de|claration, &s;o full of encouragement to &s;inners, "He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved," I mu&s;t &s;et before you the dreadful contra&s;t, "He that believeth not &s;hall be damned." If you continue in impenitence and unbelief, the wrath of God will abide on you; all the means that have been u&s;ed, and all the pains that have been taken with you, by the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t and other chri&s;tians, &s;ince you have been in a &s;tate of confinement, (and few have experienced more kind|ne&s;s in this regard) all the&s;e will ri&s;e up in judgment to condemn you. The merciful God will have no mercy upon you&mdash;He will bani&s;h you his pre&s;ence&mdash;and make you fuel for unquenchable flames. This &s;econd death is infinitely more to be dreaded than that which you are &s;oon to &s;uffer. "Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do; but fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to ca&s;t into hell; yea, I &s;ay unto you, fear him."&mdash;I have this day &s;et before you life and death, ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing&mdash;oh! be per|&s;uaded to chu&s;e life&mdash;</P>

Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, with a&s;toni&s;hing conde&s;cen&s;i|on, &s;aid to the thief upon the cro&s;s, "this day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e." While the Son of God thus di&s;played the dignity of his character, and manife&s;ted his infinite mercy to the penitent believing malefactor; what &s;acred joy mu&s;t it afford this, I will not &s;ay unhappy, but, this truly ble&s;&s;ed man, to have his pardon &s;ealed by the lips of his Saviour! To hear this kind a&s;&s;urance from him, who was the anointed Son of God, the King of I&s;rael!&mdash;How did his heart ri&s;e in gratitude to God!&mdash;How did he rejoice in the thought of being with him, whom he acknowledged as his Lord!&mdash;How did he anticipate the joys of heaven!&mdash;And with what pungent &s;orrow mu&s;t he afterward be a witne&s;s of the death of this benevolent Saviour!&mdash;How mu&s;t he admire his infinite philan|throphy!&mdash;And in what a horrid light did he view &s;in, his own &s;ins, which occa&s;ioned the &s;ufferings of this illu&s;trious per&s;on!&mdash;He &s;aw the dying agonies of the Son of God&mdash;he looked to him, and mourned the wickedne&s;s, the cruelty, and ingratitude of man&mdash;He was humbled and confounded, even though he was a&s;&s;ured by him who is truth it&s;elf, that God was pacified towards him&mdash;The larger experience he had of the grace of the Redeemer, the more would this tragic &s;cene affect and di&s;tre&s;s him.</P>
<P>You, <HI>my friend,</HI> are not to expect, even if you are &s;o happy as to be converted to God, that you &s;hall have &s;o &s;en&s;ible evidence of this ble&s;&s;ed change; you will not hear your Redeemer a&s;&s;uring you, with an audible voice, that you &s;hall have a place in paradi&s;e&mdash;you will not have an immediate revelation from heaven, that you are a child of God, and have an intere&s;t in the great and precious promi&s;es of the go&s;pel. The way in which God makes it evident to his &s;aints and peo|ple, that they are to have a place in his kingdom, is by implanting a principle of holine&s;s, and making them
<PB N="26" REF="012759_0026_0F94FA49D4DC39A8">
like his own ble&s;&s;ed &s;elf. It is by their &s;anctification he makes it clear that they are ju&s;tified. The Spirit witne&s;&s;es with our &s;pirits, that we are the children of God, by enabling us to exerci&s;e tho&s;e graces, which the &s;cripture makes the marks of God's children. It is while they walk not after the fle&s;h but after the Spirit, that they attain to the ble&s;&s;ed &s;atisfaction, that there is no condemnation belonging to them. You <HI>poor pri&s;oner!</HI> are not like to have much time to try your&s;elf by the&s;e marks of grace. You cannot be certain, how you &s;hould behave, if you was again al|lowed to appear on the &s;tage of action, and was anew expo&s;ed to the &s;nares and temptations of this pre&s;ent evil world. You have known, young and inexperi|enced as you are, you have known <HI>&s;ome</HI> upon &s;ick|beds, who have had &s;uch views of &s;in, as that they have been very confident, they &s;hould never again al|low them&s;elves in it; and yet, when God hath merci|fully &s;pared them, they have relap&s;ed into their for|mer vices; yea, have become more hardened and im|pious than ever. How do you know? how <HI>can</HI> you know, that you &s;hould not be like the&s;e, if you had opportunity?&mdash;You are not like to have &s;uch oppor|tunity&mdash;But as &s;uch in&s;tances &s;hew you the treachery of the human heart, be very jealous of your&s;elf&mdash;very cautious how you think your &s;tate &s;afe&mdash;Be careful to lay the foundation right. "Other foundation can no man lay, be&s;ides what is laid, which is Chri&s;t Je|&s;us." All your dependence mu&s;t be upon him; and all your expectations from him. Through him alone, you can hope for pardon. From him you mu&s;t de|rive that divine principle, and that holy di&s;po&s;ition, without which you cannot &s;ee the Lord. Make it your con&s;tant prayer, that you may not be deceived in a matter of &s;uch infinite importance. Adopt the language of the holy p&s;almi&s;t, "Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts, and &s;ee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead
<PB N="27" REF="012759_0027_0F94FA4A920F0818">
me in the way everla&s;ting." It would be dreadful in|deed! to leave the world with a lye in your right hand; to fall from the mo&s;t tow'ring hopes of future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, into an aby&s;s of darkne&s;s and mi&s;ery. Be earne&s;t with God&mdash;Be very importunate&mdash;that you may not meet with &s;uch an awful di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>None of us, who are now with you before the Lord, are able to tell the time of our death&mdash;Your time is fixed&mdash;Your &s;entence is pronounced&mdash;In le&s;s than a week, your days will be extinct, the grave will be ready for you. You are to die before a numerous multitude of &s;pectators. The infamy, which will at|tend your death, is a circum&s;tance of little impor|tance. Your great concern &s;hould be, that your &s;oul may be &s;afe. Commit this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure, your precious and immortal &s;pirit, into his hands, who is able to keep that which you commit unto him again&s;t that day. Think of the greatne&s;s of your &s;ins&mdash;Think of the glory of Chri&s;t&mdash;Think what he hath done for &s;inful man, that he hath laid down his life a &s;acrifice&mdash;Think what he is now doing, that he is interceding for &s;inners in the court of heaven&mdash;Think of the ex|ceeding greatne&s;s of his power, as well as riches of his grace&mdash;humbly plead for mercy. Like the poor publican, &s;mite on your brea&s;t and &s;ay, God be mer|ciful to me a &s;inner!&mdash;or take to your&s;elf the language of the penitent thief, Lord, remember me in thy kingdom.</P>
<P>Never think your work done while you have a mo|ment to live&mdash;make much of the little time you have before you&mdash;con&s;tantly read the holy &s;criptures&mdash;be diligent in your devout addre&s;&s;es to him who only can work in you to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure&mdash;And, God forbid! that we &s;hould cea&s;e to pray, that He would extend his compa&s;&s;ion and grace to you, and that the de&s;truction of your body may prove the
<PB N="28" REF="012759_0028_0F94FA4B514B94F0">
&s;alvation of your &s;oul&mdash;It may be an encouragement to you in your prayers, that a multitude of others bear you on their hearts at the throne of grace.</P>
<P>And now, I &s;incerely &s;ay, Farewell!&mdash;The God of heaven have mercy on you and ble&s;s you, and &s;ave you with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation!&mdash;God knows whe|ther we &s;hall ever again &s;ee each other's face in this world; may he, of his infinite mercy, grant us a hap|py meeting at the right hand of Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</P>
<P>I &s;hould gladly make &s;ome more particular im|provement of the &s;ubject we have been upon, and of the melancholy &s;pectacle before us, to this numerous a&s;&s;embly, many of whom their curio&s;ity hath led hi|ther at this time. But I have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed on your pa|tience already.</P>
<P>You &s;ee an unhappy young per&s;on doomed to die by the &s;entence of the civil magi&s;trate&mdash;Look upon him&mdash;and be thankful for tho&s;e re&s;traints of divine grace, whereby you have been kept from &s;uch pre|&s;umptuous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, as, in the righteous judg|ment of God, often terminate in ignominious puni&s;h|ment, and earne&s;tly pray that he would &s;till keep you from &s;uch evil practices. When you &s;ee this &s;ad con&s;equence of indulging vice, let it make you watchful again&s;t your own corruptions, and again&s;t e|ven the occa&s;ions of &s;in.</P>
<P>May our children and young people be awakened to think on their ways, and to turn their feet into the path of God's commandments! Behold! O our children and youth! what it is to provoke the Holy Spirit of God, by rebelling again&s;t him, and re&s;i&s;ting the kind motives he &s;ets before you. No one arrives at the highe&s;t pitch of wickedne&s;s at once. You be|gin with what you think &s;maller tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and
<PB N="29" REF="012759_0029_0F94FA4C2FF12D98">
indulge to &s;ecret &s;ins; the&s;e &s;ilence the voice of con|&s;cience, grieve the Spirit of God, and provoke him to leave you to your own hearts lu&s;ts; and no one can tell, whither the&s;e may carry you, nor in what they may end. This poor man, perhaps a few years ago, thought as little of &s;uch an early and ignominious death, as any of you. Nothing can be &s;o effectual a &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;uch great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, as an inward principle of holine&s;s. This will &s;ecure the protection of him who is able to with-hold you from &s;inning a|gain&s;t him.</P>
<P>Perhaps, there are &s;ome pre&s;ent, who, if their crimes were brought to light, would receive puni&s;h|ment from men; but remember, that you cannot e|&s;cape the righteous judgment of God. Or however innocent you may be according to the law of man, yet you &s;tand condemned by the law of God. In God's &s;ight no fle&s;h living can be ju&s;tified. You mu&s;t &s;oon die, and give an account to him who will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s. Near as this condemned criminal is to death, you may be taken out of the world before him. Yea, 'tis po&s;&s;ible, that he may be made a monument of divine grace, and you, who now look upon him as an object of pity and compa&s;&s;i|on, may be doomed to eternal torments.</P>
<P>Are you enemies to God by wicked works? This places you in a wor&s;e &s;tate, than any temporal puni&s;h|ment, in it&s;elf con&s;idered, could put you in. You are every moment expo&s;ed to everla&s;ting de&s;truction, which is wor&s;e than death. Oh! fly to Chri&s;t now, while there is hope. I have &s;et before this poor pri|&s;oner the only way in which he can be &s;aved. There is but one way of &s;alvation for you and for him. Make ha&s;te, make no delay; you run a dreadful ven|ture every moment you put off this important con|cern, becau&s;e the next moment may fini&s;h your time of probation, and begin your everla&s;ting doom.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="012759_0030_0F94FA52124429A8">
It is po&s;&s;ible, one who has lived all his days in &s;in, may repent in his la&s;t moments. But will you ven|ture your eternal all on a hare po&s;&s;ibility? 'Tis po&s;|&s;ible, you may be the riche&s;t man in the univer&s;e; but would not he be deemed a mad-man, who, upon &s;uch pre&s;umption, &s;hould neglect to u&s;e means to procure a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? The madne&s;s is greater, infinitely grea|ter, to neglect the care of our &s;ouls, which are made for eternity, and are in danger of being lo&s;t forever. Boa&s;t not thy&s;elf of to-morrow, for thou knowe&s;t not what a day may bring forth. Many, who have de|pended on a future opportunity, have been cut off in their &s;ins, and their &s;ouls have been lo&s;t forever.</P>
<P>Let me exhort and intreat all who may attend the execution of this poor condemned criminal, to lay to heart &s;uch an affecting &s;ight, and to behave with de|cency and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s on &s;uch a &s;olemn occa&s;ion. And may the awful &s;pectacle be a means of in&s;truction and amendment to &s;inners! May they find their hearts &s;uitably impre&s;&s;ed; and &s;incerely re&s;olve that wherein they have done iniquity, they will do &s;o no more! Let us all implore the Spirit and grace of God, to pre&s;erve us from the great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion&mdash;from every violation of his holy law&mdash;And may others hear and fear and not dare to do &s;o wickedly!</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who have rea&s;on to think their peace is made with, and hope, that, when they leave this world, they &s;hall go to be with Chri&s;t in paradi&s;e, give glory to him who hath &s;o marvellou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed them. Who maketh thee to differ from other men?&mdash;from tho&s;e who live in vice and &s;in?&mdash;or from this poor pri&s;oner? or what ha&s;t thou that thou did&s;t not receive? Now if thou did&s;t receive it, why do&s;t thou glory as if thou had&s;t not received it? If God hath thus di&s;tingui&s;hed us, let us adore the &s;overeign mer|cy of God, which hath not only plucked us as brands
<PB N="31" REF="012759_0031_0F94FA54B7EF9480">
out of the burning, but rai&s;ed us to the hopes of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality.</P>
<P>While you give glory to God who hath called and cho&s;en you, let me be&s;peak your earne&s;t prayers to God for this poor young man, that God would give him true repentance, and di&s;play the riches of his grace in his everla&s;ting &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Let us with gratitude and joy think of that ble&s;&s;ed time when Chri&s;t will receive us into his kingdom&mdash;when we &s;hall be delivered from the trials and diffi|culties of life&mdash;when we &s;hall be no more witne&s;&s;es of the crimes of others&mdash;and &s;hall our&s;elves be free from tho&s;e remains of &s;in which attend us in this world, and &s;hall be perfectly holy and perfectly happy. God grant, that this may be the portion of each one of us, for the &s;ake of his dear Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord!</P>
