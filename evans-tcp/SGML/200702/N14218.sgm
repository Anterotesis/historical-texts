<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the world is but little concerned to know, in what &s;ituation the author of any performance that is offered to its peru&s;al may be, yet I believe it is generally &s;olicitous to learn &s;ome circum&s;tances relating to him: for my own part, I have al|ways experienced this de&s;ire in my&s;elf; and read the adverti&s;ement at the beginning, and the po&s;t&s;cript at the end of a book, if they contain any information of that &s;ort, with a kind of melancholy inquietude about the fate of him, in who&s;e company, as it were, I have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome harmle&s;s hours, and who&s;e &s;enti|ments have been unbo&s;omed to me with the openne&s;s of a friend.</P>
<P>The life of him who has had an opportunity of pre&s;enting to the eye of the public the following tale, though &s;ufficiently chequered with vici&s;&s;itude, has been &s;pent in a &s;tate of ob&s;curity, the recital of which could but little excite admiration, or gratify curio&s;ity: the manner of his procuring the &s;tory contained in the following &s;heets, is all he thinks him&s;elf entitled to relate.</P>
<P>After &s;ome wanderings at that time of life which is mo&s;t &s;ubject to wandering, I had found an opportunity of revi&s;iting the &s;cenes of my earlier attachments, and returned to my native &s;pot with that tender emotion, which the heart that can be moved at all, will naturally feel on approaching it. The remembrance of my infant days, like the fancied vibration of plea&s;ant &s;ounds in the ear, was &s;till alive in my mind; and I flew to find out the marks by which even inanimate things were to be known, as the friends of my youth, not forgotten, though long un&s;een, nor le&s;&s;ened, in my e&s;|timation, from the pride of refinement, of the compari&s;on of ex|perience.</P>
<P>In the &s;hade of an ancient tree, that centered a circle of elms, at the end of the village where I was born, I found my old acquaint|ance, Jack Ryland: he was gathering mo&s;s with one hand, while the other held a flannel-bag, containing earth-worms, to be u&s;ed as bait in angling. On &s;eeing me, Ryland dropped his mo&s;s on the ground, and ran with all the warmth of friend&s;hip to embrace me. "My dear Tom, &s;aid he, how happy I am to &s;ee you! you have travelled no doubt a woundy long way &s;ince we parted.&mdash; You find me in the old way here.&mdash;I believe they have but a &s;orry notion of &s;port in Italy.&mdash;While I think on't, look on this me now; I'll be hang'd if the &s;harpe&s;t-ey'd trout in the river can know it from the natural. It was but ye&s;terday now&mdash;You remem|ber the cro&s;s-tree pool, ju&s;t below the par&s;onage&mdash;there I hook'd him, play'd him half an hour by the clock, and landed him at la&s;t as far down as the church-way ford. As for his &s;ize&mdash;Lord! how unlucky it is that I have not my landing-net here; for now I recol|lect that I mark'd his length on the out&s;ide of the pole; but you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> it &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other time."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="018007_0003_0FA4548808C289D8">Let not my reader be impatient at my friend Ryland's harangue. I give it him, becau&s;e I would have characters develop them&s;elves. To throw, however, &s;ome farther light upon Ryland's:</P>
<P>He was fir&s;t-cou&s;in to a gentleman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable e&s;tate in our county, born to no fortune, and not much formed by nature for acquiring one; he found pretty early that he &s;hould never be rich, but that he might po&s;&s;ibly be happy; and happine&s;s to him was obtained without effort, becau&s;e it was drawn from &s;ources which it required little exertion to &s;upply: trifles were the bound|aries of his de&s;ire, and their attainment the goal of his felicity. A certain neatne&s;s at all tho&s;e little arts in which the &s;oul has no &s;hare, an immoderate love of &s;port, and a &s;till more immoderate love of reciting its progre&s;s, with the addition of one faculty, which has &s;ome &s;mall connexion with letters, to wit, a remarkable memory for puzzles and enigmas, made up his character; and he enjoyed a privilege uncommon to the happy, that no one envied the means by which he attained what every one pur&s;ues.</P>
<P>I interrupted his narrative by &s;ome enquiries about my former acquaintance in the village; for Ryland was the recorder of the place, and could have told the names, families, relations, and in|ter-marriages of the pari&s;h, with much more accuracy than the regi&s;ter.</P>
<P>"Alackaday! &s;aid Jack, there have been many changes a|mong us &s;ince you left this: here has died the old gauger Wil&s;on, as good a cricket-player as ever handled a bat; Rooke, at the Salutation, is gone too; and his wife has left the pari&s;h and &s;et|led in London, where I'm told &s;he keeps a gin-&s;hop in &s;ome &s;treet they call Southwark; and the poor par&s;on, whom you were &s;o in|timate with, the worthy old Anne&s;ly!"&mdash;He looked piteou&s;ly to|wards the church-yard, and a tear trickled down his cheek &mdash; "I under&s;tand you, &s;aid I, the good man is dead!"&mdash;"Ah! there is more than you think about his death, an&s;wered Jack; he died of a broken heart!" I could make no reply but by an ejaculation, and Ryland accompanied it with another tear; for, though he commonly looked but on the &s;urface of things, yet Ryland had a heart to feel.</P>
<P>"In the middle of you clump of alders, &s;aid he, you may re|member a &s;mall hou&s;e, that was once farmer Higgins's; it is now occupied by a gentlewoman of the name of Wi&s;tanly, who was formerly a &s;ort of &s;ervant-companion to &s;ir Thomas Sindall's mo|ther, the widow of &s;ir William; her mi&s;tre&s;s, who died &s;ome years ago, left her an annuity, and that hou&s;e for life, where &s;he has lived ever &s;ince. I am told that &s;he knows more of Anne&s;ly's af|fairs than any other body; but &s;he is &s;o &s;ilent and &s;hy, that I could never, get a word from her on the &s;ubject: &s;he is reckon'd a wonderful &s;cholar by the folks of the village; and you, who are a man of reading, might perhaps be a greate favorite with her; if you chu&s;e it, I &s;hall introduce you to her immediately." I ac|cepted his offer, and we went to her hou&s;e together.</P>
<P>We found her &s;itting in a little parlour, &s;itted up in a ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> much
<PB N="5" REF="018007_0004_0FA4548998587BA0">
&s;uperior to what might have been expected from the appearance of the hou&s;e, with &s;ome &s;helves, on which I ob&s;erved &s;everal of the mo&s;t cla&s;&s;ical Engli&s;h and French authors. She ro&s;e to receive us with &s;omething in her manner greatly above her &s;eeming rank; Jack introduced me as an acquaintance of her decea&s;ed friend, Mr. Anne&s;ly.</P>
<P>"Then, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, you knew a man who had few fellows!" lifting her eyes gently upwards. The tender &s;olemnity of her look an&s;wered the very movement which the remembrance had awaked in my &s;oul, and I made no other reply than by a tear. She &s;eem|ed to take it in good part, and we met on that ground, like old friends, who had much to a&s;k, and much to be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>When we were going away, &s;he begged to have a moment's conver&s;ation with me alone; Ryland left us together.</P>
<P>"If I am not deceived, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, in the opinion I have formed of you, your feelings are very different from tho&s;e of Mr. Ryland, and indeed of mo&s;t of my neighbours in the village; you &s;eem to have had a peculiar intere&s;t in the fate of that worthie&s;t of men, Mr. Anne&s;ly. The hi&s;tory of that life of purity which he led, of that calamity by which it was &s;hortened, might not be an unplea&s;ing, though a melancholy recital to you; but in this box which &s;tands on the table by me, is contained a &s;eries of letters and papers, which, if you will take the trouble of reading them, will &s;ave me the ta&s;k of recounting his &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>"You will find many pa&s;&s;ages which do not indeed relate to it; but, as they are often the entertainment of my lei&s;ure hours, I have marked the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts on the margin. This de|po&s;it, Sir, though its general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mportance be &s;mall, my affection for my departed friend makes me con&s;ider as a compliment, and I commit it to you, as to one in who&s;e favor I have conceived a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from that very cau&s;e."</P>
<P>Tho&s;e letters and papers were the ba&s;is of what I now offer to the public: had it been my intention <HI>to make a Book,</HI> I might have publi&s;hed them entire; and I am per&s;uaded, notwith&s;tanding Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's remark, that no part of them would have been found more foreign to the general drift of the&s;e volumes, than many that have got admittance into &s;imilar collections: but I have cho&s;en rather to throw them into the form of a narrative, and contented my&s;elf with tran&s;cribing &s;uch reflexions as naturally ari&s;e from the events, and &s;uch &s;entiments as the &s;ituations alone appear to have excited.</P>
<P>There are indeed many &s;upplementory facts, which could not have been found in this collection of Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's; the&s;e I was at &s;ome pains to procure through other channels: how I was enabled to procure them the reader may conceive, if his patience can hold out to the end of the &s;tory; to account for that now, would delay its commencement, and anticipate its conclu&s;ion, for both which effects this introductory chapter may have already been &s;ubject to reprehen&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>THE MAN OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. In which are &s;ome particulars previous to the com|mencement of the main &s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>RICHARD ANNESLY was the only child of a wealthy trade&s;man in London, who, from the experience of that profit which his bu&s;ine&s;s afforded him&s;elf, was anxious it &s;hould de&s;cend to his &s;on&punc; unfortunately the young man had acquired a certain train of ideas which were totally aver&s;e to that line of life his father had marked out for him. There is a degree of &s;entiment, which, in the bo&s;om of a man de&s;tined to the drudgery of the world, is the &s;ource of endle&s;s di&s;gu&s;t: of this young Anne&s;ly was unluckily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and as he fore&s;aw, or thought he fore&s;aw, that it would not only endanger his &s;ucce&s;s, but take from the en|joyment of pro&s;perity, &s;uppo&s;ing it attained, he declined follow|ing that road which his father had &s;moothed for his progre&s;s, and at the ri&s;k of tho&s;e temporal advantages which the old gentleman's di&s;plea&s;ure, on this occa&s;ion, might deny him, entered into the &s;ervice of the church, and retired to the country on one of the &s;mal|le&s;t endowments &s;he has to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>That feeling which prevents the acqui&s;ition of wealth, is form|ed for the &s;upport of poverty; the contentment of the poor, I had almo&s;t &s;aid their pride, buoys up the &s;pirit again&s;t the depre&s;&s;ion of adver&s;ity, and gives to our very wants the appearance of enjoy|ment.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly looked on happine&s;s as confined to the &s;phere of &s;eque&s;|tered life. The pomp of greatne&s;s, the plea&s;ures of the affluent, he con&s;idered as only productive of turbulence, di&s;quiet, and re|mor&s;e; and thanked heaven for having placed him in his own lit|tle &s;hed, which, in his opinion, was the re&s;idence of pure and la&s;t|ing felicity.</P>
<P>With this view of things his father's ideas did by no means coin|cide: his anger again&s;t his &s;on continued till his death; and when
<PB N="8" REF="018007_0007_0FA4548CEE4F3598">
that event happened, with the prepo&s;terous revenge of many a parent, he con&s;igned him to mi&s;ery, as he thought, becau&s;e he would not be unhappy in that way which he had in&s;i&s;ted on his following, and cut him off from the inheritance of his birth, be|cau&s;e he had cho&s;en a profe&s;&s;ion which kept him in poverty with|out it.</P>
<P>Though Anne&s;ly could &s;upport the fear of poverty, he could not ea&s;ily bear the thought of a dying father's di&s;plea&s;ure. On receiv|ing intelligence of his being in a dangerous &s;ituation, he ha&s;ted to London, with the purpo&s;e of wringing from him his forgivene&s;s for the only offence with which his &s;on had ever been chargeable; but he arrived too late: his father had breathed his la&s;t on the evening of the day preceding that on which he reached the metro|polis, and his hou&s;e was already in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a nephew, to whom his &s;on under&s;tood he had left every &s;hilling of his fortune. This man had been bred a haberda&s;her, at the expre&s;s de&s;ire of old Anne&s;ly, and had all that patient dulne&s;s which qualifies for get|ting rich, which, therefore, in the eyes of his uncle, was the mo&s;t e&s;timable of all qualities.</P>
<P>He had &s;eldom &s;een Richard Anne&s;ly before, for indeed this la&s;t was not very &s;olicitous of his acquaintance; he recollected his face however, and de&s;iring him to &s;it down, informed him particu|larly of the &s;ettlement which his relentle&s;s father had made. "It was unlucky, &s;aid the haberda&s;her, that you &s;hould have made choice of &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion; but a par&s;on, of all trades in the world, he could never endure.</P>
<P>"It is po&s;&s;ible you may be low in ca&s;h at this time: if you want a &s;mall matter to buy mournings or &s;o, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to ad|vance you the needful; and I wi&s;h you would take them of neigh|bour Bullock, the woollen-draper, who is as hone&s;t a man as any of the trade, and would not impo&s;e on a child." Anne&s;ly's eyes had been hitherto fixed on the ground; nor was there wanting a tear in each for his unnatural father: he turned them on this cou&s;|in with as contemptuous a look as his nature allowed them to a&s;|&s;ume, and walked out of the hou&s;e without uttering a word.</P>
<P>He was now thrown upon the world with the &s;entence of perpe|tual poverty for his inheritance. He found him&s;elf in the middle of a crouded &s;treet in London, &s;urrounded by the buzzing &s;ons of indu&s;try, and &s;hrunk back at the &s;en&s;e of his own in&s;ignificance. In the faces of tho&s;e he met, he &s;aw no acknowledgment of con|nexion, and felt him&s;elf, like Cain after his brother's murder, an un&s;heltered, unfriended outca&s;t. He looked back to his father's door; but his &s;pirit was too mild for reproach &mdash; a tear dropped from his eye as he looked!</P>
<P>There was in London one per&s;on, who&s;e gentle nature he knew would feel for his misfortunes; yet to that one, of all others, his pride forbade him to re&s;ort.</P>
<P>Harriet Wilkins was the daughter of a neighbour of his father's, who had for &s;ome time given up bu&s;ine&s;s, and lived on the intere&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="018007_0008_0FA4548DF5D28C98">
of 4000<HI>l.</HI> which he had &s;aved in the cour&s;e of it. From this circum|&s;tance, his acquaintance, old Anne&s;ly, entertained no very high opinion of his under&s;tanding; and did not cultivate much friend|&s;hip with a man whom he con&s;idered as a drone in the hive of &s;oci|ety: but in this opinion, as in many others, his &s;on had the mi&s;|fortune to differ from him; he u&s;ed frequently to &s;teal into Wil|kins's hou&s;e of an evening, to enjoy the conver&s;ation of one who had pa&s;&s;ed through life with ob&s;ervation, and had known the labour of bu&s;ine&s;s without that contraction of &s;oul which it often occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Harriet was commonly of the party, li&s;tening with Anne&s;ly to her father's di&s;cour&s;e, and with Anne&s;ly offering her remarks on it. She was not hand&s;ome enough to attract notice; but her look was of that complacent &s;ort which gains on the beholder, and plea&s;es from the acknowledgment that it is beneath admiration.</P>
<P>Nor was her mind ill &s;uited to this "Index of the &s;oul." Without that brilliancy which excites the general applau&s;e, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e inferior &s;weetne&s;&s;es which acquire the general e&s;teem; &s;incere, benevolent, inoffen&s;ive, and una&s;&s;uming. Nobody talked of the &s;ayings of Mi&s;s Wilkins; but every one heard her with plea&s;ure, and her &s;mile was the &s;ignal of univer&s;al complacency.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly found him&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly attached to her by a chain, which had been impo&s;ed without art, and &s;uffered without con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s. During his acquaintance with Harriet, he had come to that period of life, when men are mo&s;t apt to be impre&s;&s;ed with appearances; in fact, he had looked on many a beauty with a rapture which he thought &s;incere till it was interrupted by the re|flexion that &s;he was not Harriet Wilkins; there was a certain in|definable attraction which linked him every day clo&s;er to her, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of manner had the effect (which I pre&s;ume, from their practice, few young ladies believe it to have) of &s;ecuring the con|que&s;t &s;he had gained.</P>
<P>From the wealth which old Anne&s;ly was known to po&s;&s;e&s;s, his &s;on was, doubtle&s;s, in the phra&s;e of the world, a very advantage|ous match for Mi&s;s Wilkins; but when her father di&s;covered the young man to be &s;erious in his attachment to her, he frequently took occa&s;ion to &s;ugge&s;t, how unequal the &s;mall fortune he could leave his daughter, was to the expectations of the &s;on of a man worth 30,000<HI>l.</HI> and with a frankne&s;s peculiar to him&s;elf, gave the father to under&s;tand, that his &s;on's vi&s;its were rather more frequent than was con&s;i&s;tent with that track of prudence which the old gen|tleman would probably mark out for him. The father, however, took little notice of this intelligence; the truth was, that, judg|ing by him&s;elf, he gave very little credit to it; becau&s;e it came from one, who, according to his conception of things, &s;hould, of all others, have concealed it from his knowlege.</P>
<P>But though his &s;on had the mo&s;t &s;incere attachment to Mi&s;s Wilkins, his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances rendered it, in the language of prudence, impo&s;&s;ible for them to marry. They contented them|&s;elves
<PB N="10" REF="018007_0009_0FA4548E8E6A98F8">
therefore with the a&s;&s;urance of each other's con&s;tancy, and waited for &s;ome favourable change of condition which might allow them to be happy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t idea which &s;truck Anne&s;ly's mind on the di&s;appointment he &s;uffered from his father's &s;ettlement, was the effect it would have on his &s;ituation with regard to Harriet. There is perhaps nothing more bitter in the lot of poverty, than the di&s;tance to which it throws a man from the woman he loves; that pride I have before taken notice of, which in every other circum&s;tance tends to his &s;upport, &s;erves but to wound him the deeper in this. That feeling now turned Anne&s;ly's feet from his Harriet's door; yet it was now that his Harriet &s;eemed the more worthy of his love, in proportion is his circum&s;tances rendered it hopele&s;s. A train of &s;oft reflexions at length bani&s;hed this rugged gue&s;t from his heart &mdash; "'Tis but taking a la&s;t farewell!" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, and trod back the &s;teps which he had made.</P>
<P>He entered the room where Harriet was &s;itting by her father, with a &s;ort of diffidence of his reception that he was not able to hide; but Wilkins welcomed him in &s;uch a manner, as &s;oon di&s;|&s;ipated the re&s;traint under which the thoughts of his poverty had laid him. "This vi&s;it, my dear Anne&s;ly, &s;aid he, flatters me, becau&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hows you leaning on my friend&s;hip. I am not ignorant of your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and I know the effect which prudent men will &s;ay it &s;hould have on my&s;elf; that I differ from them, may be the con&s;equence of &s;pleen, perhaps rather than genero&s;ity: for I have been at war with the world from a boy. Come hither, Harriet; this is Richard Anne&s;ly: his father, it is true, has left him 30,000<HI>l.</HI> poorer than it was once expected he would: but he is Richard Anne&s;ly &s;till! you will therefore look upon him as you did before. I am not &s;toic enough to deny, that riches afford num|berle&s;s comforts and conveniencies which are denied to the poor; but that riches are not e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s I know, becau&s;e I have never yet found my&s;elf unhappy;&mdash;nor &s;hall I now &s;leep un|&s;ound from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having added to the pre&s;&s;ure of affliction, or wounded merit afre&s;h, becau&s;e fortune had already wounded it."</P>
<P>Liberal minds will delight in extending the empire of virtue; for my own part, I am happy to believe, that it is po&s;&s;ible for an attorney to be hone&s;t, and a trade&s;man to think like Wilkins.</P>

<P>WILKINS having thus overlooked the want of fortune in his young friend, the lovers found but little hindrance to the completion of their wi&s;hes: Harriet became the wife of a poor

man, who returned the obligation he owed to her and her father's genero&s;ity, by a tenderne&s;s and affection rarely found in wedlock, becau&s;e there are few minds from whom in rea&s;on they can be expected.</P>
<P>His father-in-law, to whom indeed the &s;acrifice was but trifling, could not re&s;i&s;t the joint reque&s;t of his daughter and her hu&s;band, to leave the town and make one of their family in the country. In &s;omewhat le&s;s than a year he was the grand-father of a boy, and nearly at the &s;ame di&s;tance of time after, of a girl, both of whom in his opinion, were cherubs; but even the go&s;&s;ips around them owned they had never &s;een more promi&s;ing children. The felicity of their little circle was now perhaps as perfect as the lot of humani|ty admits; nor would it have been ea&s;y to have found a group, who&s;e minds were better formed to de&s;erve or attain it. Health, innocence, and good-humour were of their hou&s;ehold; and many an hone&s;t neighbour, who never troubled him&s;elf to account for it, talked of the goodne&s;s of Anne&s;ly's ale, and the chearfulne&s;s of his fire-&s;ide. I have been often admitted of the party, though I was too young for a companion to the &s;eniors, and too old for a play-fellow to the children; but no age, and often indeed no condition, excluded from a participation of their happine&s;s; and I have &s;een little Billy, before he could &s;peak to be well under&s;tood, lead in a long bearded beggar, to &s;ing his &s;ong in its turn, and be rewarded with a cup of that excellent liquor I mentioned.</P>
<P>Their felicity was too perfect to be la&s;ting.&mdash;Such is the pro|verbial opinion of mankind: the days of joy, however, are not more winged in their cour&s;e than the days of &s;orrow; but we count not the moments of their duration with &s;o &s;crupulous an ex|actne&s;s.</P>
<P>Three years after the birth of her fir&s;t daughter, Mrs. Anne&s;ly was delivered of another; but the birth of the la&s;t was fatal to her mother, who did not many days &s;urvive it. Anne&s;ly's grief on this occa&s;ion was immoderate; nor could all the endeavours of his father-in-law, who&s;e mind was able to pre&s;erve more compo&s;ure&punc; prevail upon him, for &s;ome days, to remember the common offices of life, or leave the room in which his Harriet had expired. Wil|kins's grief, however, though of a more &s;ilent &s;ort, was not le&s;s deep in its effects; and when the turbulence of the other's &s;orrow had yielded to the &s;oothings of time, the old man retained all that render regret, &s;o due to the death of a child, an only child, who&s;e filial duty had led him down the &s;lope of life without &s;uffering him to perceive the de&s;cent.</P>
<P>The infant &s;he had left behind her was now doubly endeared to its father and him&punc; from being con&s;idered as the la&s;t memorial of its dying mother; but of this melancholy kind of comfort they were al&s;o deprived in a few months by the &s;mall-pox. Wilkins &s;eemed by this &s;econd blow to be loo&s;ened from the little hold he had &s;truggled to keep of the world, and his re&s;ignation was now built upon the hopes, not of overcoming his affliction, but of e&s;caping from its pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="018007_0011_0FA45490AC9D6AD0">The &s;erenity which &s;uch an idea confers, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of all others the greate&s;t dignity, becau&s;e it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of all others the be&s;t-a&s;|&s;ured confidence, leaning on a ba&s;is that is fixed above the rota|tion of &s;ublunary things. An old man, who has lived in the ex|erci&s;e of virtue, looking back, without a blu&s;h, on the tenor of his pa&s;t days, and pointing to that better &s;tate, where alone he can be perfectly rewarded, is a figure the mo&s;t venerable that can well be imagined: &s;uch did Wilkins now exhibit.</P>
<P>"My &s;on, &s;aid he to Anne&s;ly, I feel that I &s;hall not be with you long; yet I leave not the world with that peevi&s;h di&s;gu&s;t, which is &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for the courage that overcomes the dread of death: I lay down my being, with gratitude, for having &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, without having di&s;graced it, by any great violation of the laws of him, by whom it was be&s;towed. There is &s;omething we cannot help feeling, on the fall of tho&s;e hopes we had been vain|ly diligent to rear; I had looked forward to &s;ome happy days, a|mid&s;t a race of my Harriet's and yours; but to the good, there can be no rea&s;onable regret from the di&s;appointment of &s;uch expec|tations, becau&s;e the futurity, they tru&s;t in after death, mu&s;t far exceed any enjoyment which a longer life here could have afforded. It is otherwi&s;e with the pro&s;pect of duty to be done; the&s;e two little ones, I leave to your tenderne&s;s and care; you will value life, as it gives you an opportunity of forming them to virtue &mdash; Lay me be&s;ide my Harriet!"</P>
<P>The old man's prediction was but too well verified; he did not long &s;urvive this pathetic declaration. His &s;on-in-law was now ex|po&s;ed, alone and una&s;&s;i&s;ted, to the cares of the world, increa&s;ed by the charge of his boy and girl; but the mind will &s;upport much, when called into exertion by the nece&s;&s;ity of things. His &s;orrow yielded by degrees to the thoughts of that active duty he owed his children; in time his fire-&s;ide was again cheared by their &s;ports around it; and though he &s;ometimes looked upon them with a tear, at the recollection of the pa&s;t, yet would he as often wipe it from his eye, in &s;ilent gratitude to heaven, for the enjoyment of the pre&s;ent, and the anticipation of the future.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The openings of two characters, with which the reader may afterwards be better acquainted.</HEAD>
<P>HIS &s;on had a warmth of temper, which the father often ob|&s;erved with mingled plea&s;ure and regret; with plea&s;ure, from con&s;idering the genero&s;ity and noblene&s;s of &s;entiment it be|&s;poke; with regret, from a foreboding of the many inconveniences to which its youthful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or might naturally be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018007_0012_0FA4549457190278">But Harriet was &s;oftne&s;s it&s;elf. The &s;prightline&s;s of her gaye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> moments would be checked by the recital of the di&s;tre&s;s of a fel|low-creature, and &s;he would often weep all night from &s;ome tale which her maid had told of fictitious di&s;a&s;ter. Her brother felt the repre&s;entation of worth ill-treated, or virtue oppre&s;&s;ed, with indignation again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;or, and wi&s;hed to be a man, that he might, like Jack the Giant-killer, gird on his &s;word of &s;harpne&s;s, and revenge the wrongs of the &s;ufferer; while his &s;i&s;ter pre&s;&s;ed his hand in hers, and trembled for the danger to which &s;he imagined him expo&s;ed; nay, &s;he has been afterwards heard to cry out in her &s;teep in a hurried voice, "You &s;hall not go, my Billy, papa and I will die if you do."</P>
<P>A trifling incident, of which I find an account in one of their father's letters, will di&s;criminate their characters better than a train of the mo&s;t laboured expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the bottom of his garden ran a little rivulet, which was there dammed up to furni&s;h water for a mill below. On the bank was a linnet's ne&s;t, which Harriet had di&s;covered in her rambles, and of|ten vi&s;ited with uncommon anxiety for the callow brood it contain|ed. One day her brother and &s;he were at play on the green at a little di&s;tance, attended by a &s;ervant of their father's, when a favorite terrier of Billy's happened to wander among&s;t the bu&s;hes where this ne&s;t was &s;heltered: Harriet, afraid of the con&s;equences, begged the &s;ervant to run, and prevent his doing mi&s;chief to the birds.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the fellow came up, the dog had lighted on the bu&s;h, and &s;urpri&s;ed the dam, but was prevented from doing her much harm by the &s;ervant, who laid hold of him by the neck, and &s;natched his prey out of his mouth: the dog, re&s;enting this rough u&s;age, bit the man's finger till it bled, who, in return, be&s;towed a hearty drubbing upon him, without regarding the entreaties or the threats of his little ma&s;ter. Billy enraged at the &s;ufferings of his favorite, re&s;olved to wreak his vengeance where it was in his power, and running up to the ne&s;t, threw it down, with all its un|fledged inhabitants, to the ground. "Cruel Billy!" cried his &s;i&s;ter, while the tears ran down her cheeks. He turned &s;ullenly from her, and walked up to the hou&s;e, while &s;he, with the man's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, gathered up the little flutterers, and having fa&s;tened the ne&s;t as well as &s;he could, replaced them &s;afely within it.</P>
<P>When &s;he &s;aw her brother again, he pouted, and would not &s;peak to her; &s;he endeavoured to regain his favour by kindne&s;s, but he refu&s;ed her care&s;&s;es; &s;he &s;ought out the dog, who had &s;uf|fered on her; linnet't account, and &s;troaking him on the head, fed him with &s;ome cold meat, from her own hand: when her brother &s;aw it, he called him away. She looked after Billy till he was gone, and then bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>Next day they were down at the rivulet again. Still was Har|riet endeavouring to be reconciled, and &s;till was her brother aver&s;e to a reconciliation: he &s;at biting his thumb, and looking angrily to the &s;pot where his favorite had been puni&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="018007_0013_0FA45495E25C7688">At that in&s;tant the linnet, in who&s;e cau&s;e the quarrel had begun, was bringing out her younglings to their fir&s;t imperfect flight, and two of them, unfortunately taking a wrong direction, fell &s;hort in|to the middle of the pool Billy &s;tarted from the ground, and, without con&s;idering the depth, ru&s;hed into the water, where he was over head and ears the &s;econd &s;tep that he made. His &s;i&s;ter's &s;creams alarmed the &s;ervant, who ran to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but before he got to the place, the boy had reached a &s;hallower part of the pool, and, though &s;taggering from his fir&s;t plunge, had &s;aved both the linnets, which he held carefully above the water, and landed &s;afely on the oppo&s;ite bank. He returned to his &s;i&s;ter by a ford be|low, and, pre&s;enting her the birds, flung his arms round her neck, and, blubbering, a&s;ked her, if &s;he would now forgive his unkind|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Such were the minds which Anne&s;ly's tuition was to form. To repre&s;s the warmth of temerity, without extingui&s;hing the generous principles from which it aro&s;e, and to give firmne&s;s to &s;en&s;ibility where it bordered on weakne&s;, without fearing its feelings where they led to virtue, was the ta&s;k he had marked out for his indu&s;try to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>He owned that his plan was frequently interrupted on both &s;ides by the tenderne&s;s of paternal affection; but he accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to remember, that, for his children he was accountable to God and their country. Nor was the &s;ituation I have de&s;cribed without difficulties, from the delicacy of preventing inclinations in the ex|treme, which were laudable in degree; "but here al&s;o, &s;aid An|ne&s;ly, it is to be remembered, that no evil is &s;o pernicious as that which grows in the &s;oil from which good &s;hould have &s;prung."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. A very brief account of their education.</HEAD>
<P>ANNESLY was not only the &s;uperintendant of his children's manners, but their ma&s;ter in the &s;everal branches of educa|tion. Reading, writing, arithmetic, the elements of mathematics and geography, with a competent knowlege of the French and Italian languages, they learned together; and while Billy was em|ployed with his father in reading Latin and Greek, his &s;i&s;ter receiv|ed in&s;truction in the female accompli&s;hments, from a better &s;ort of &s;ervant, whom Anne&s;ly kept for that purpo&s;e, who&s;e &s;tation had once been &s;uperior to &s;ervitude, and whom he &s;till treated more as a companion than a dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>This in&s;tructre&s;s indeed &s;he lo&s;t when about ten years old; but the want was more than &s;upplied by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another, to wit, Mrs. Wi&s;tanly; who devoted many of her lei&s;ure hours to the daughter of Anne&s;ly, whom &s;he had then got aquainted with,
<PB N="15" REF="018007_0014_0FA45495F87A5BD8">
and whom reciprocal worth had attached to her with the &s;incere&s;t friend&s;hip and regard. The dancing-ma&s;ter of a neighbouring town paid them a weekly vi&s;it for their in&s;truction in the &s;cience he profe&s;&s;ed; at which time al&s;o were held their family-concerts, where Anne&s;ly, who was e&s;teemed in his youth a fir&s;t-rate player on the violin, u&s;ed to pre&s;ide.</P>
<P>Billy was an excellent &s;econd; Mrs. Wi&s;tanly or her pupil un|dertook for the harp&s;icord, and the dancing-ma&s;ter played ba&s;e as well as he could. He was not a very capital performer, but he was always very willing; and found as much plea&s;ure in his own performance as the be&s;t of them. Jack Ryland too would &s;ome|times join in a catch, though indeed he had but two, <HI>Chri&s;t-church bells,</HI> and <HI>Jack, thou'rt a toper</HI>: and Anne&s;ly alledged that he was often out in the la&s;t, but Jack would never allow it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were certain evenings appropriated to exer|ci&s;es of the mind. "It is not enough, &s;aid Anne&s;ly, to put weap|ons into tho&s;e hands which never have been taught the u&s;e of them; the reading we recommend to youth will &s;tore their minds with in|telligence, if they attend to it properly; but to go a little farther&punc; we mu&s;t accu&s;tom them to apply it, we mu&s;t teach them the art of comparing the ideas with which it has furni&s;hed them."</P>
<P>In this view it was the practice, at tho&s;e &s;tated times I have mentioned, for Billy, or his &s;i&s;ter, to read a &s;elect pa&s;&s;age of &s;ome cla&s;&s;ical author, on who&s;e relations, they delivered opinions, or on who&s;e &s;entiments they offered a comment. Never was &s;een more &s;atisfaction on a countenance, than u&s;ed to enlighten their father's, at the delivery of tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, which his little philo&s;ophers were accu&s;tomed to make: indeed, there could &s;carcely, even to a &s;tranger, be a more plea&s;ing exhibition; their very errors were delightful, becau&s;e they were the errors of benevolence, genero&s;i|ty, and virtue.</P>
<P>As puni&s;hments are nece&s;&s;ary in all &s;ocieties, Anne&s;ly was oblig|ed to invent &s;ome for the regulation of his: they con&s;i&s;ted only of certain modifications of di&s;grace. One of them I &s;hall mention, becau&s;e it was exactly oppo&s;ite to the practice of mo&s;t of our &s;chools, while there, offences are puni&s;hed by doubling the ta&s;k of the &s;cholar: with Anne&s;ly, the getting of a le&s;&s;on or perform|ing of an exerci&s;e was a privilege, of which a forfeiture was incur|red by mi&s;behaviour; to teach his children, that he offered them in&s;tructions as a favor, in&s;tead of pre&s;&s;ing it as a hard&s;hip.</P>
<P>Billy had a &s;mall part of his father's garden allotted him for his peculiar property, in which he wrought him&s;elf, being furni&s;hed with no other a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the gardener than directions how to manage it, and parcels of the &s;eeds which they enabled him to &s;ow. When he had brought the&s;e to maturity, his father purcha&s;ed the produce; Billy, with part of the purcha&s;e-money, was to lay in the &s;tores nece&s;&s;ary for his future indu&s;try, and the overplus he had the liberty of be&s;towing on charitable u&s;es in the village.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="018007_0015_0FA45496AE927088"><HI>The &s;ame in&s;titution prevailed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his &s;i&s;ter's needle work or em|broidery. "For it is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;aid Anne&s;ly, to give an idea of pro|perty, but let it not be &s;eparated from the idea of beneficence."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sometimes, when the&s;e &s;ums were traced to their di&s;bur&s;ements, it was found, that Harriet's money did not always reach the village, but was intercepted by the piteous recital of a wandering beggar by the way; and that Billy u&s;ed to appropriate part of his to purpo&s;es not purely eleemo&s;ynary; as, when he once parted with two thirds of his revenue, to reward a little boy for beating a big one, who had killed his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame &s;parrow; or another time, when he went the blamable length of comforting with a &s;hilling a lad, who had been ducked in a hor&s;e-pond, for robbing the orchard of a mi&s;er.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was chiefly in this manner of in&s;tilling &s;entiments, (as in the ca&s;e of the charitable e&s;tabli&s;hment I have mentioned) by leading in|&s;en&s;ibly to the practice of virtue, rather than by downright precept, that Anne&s;ly proceeded with his children; for it was his maxim, that the heart mu&s;t feel, as well as the judgment be convinced, before the principles we mean to teach can be of habitual &s;ervice; and that the mind will always be more &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with ideas which it is led to form of it&s;elf, than with tho&s;e which it pa&s;&s;ively receives from another. When, at any time, he delivered in&s;tructions, they were always&punc; clothed in the garb rather of advices from a friend, than lec|tures from a father; and were li&s;tened to with the warmth of friend|&s;hip, as well as the humility of veneration. It is in truth &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ing, how little intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between parents and their child|ren, e&s;pecially of our &s;ex; a circum&s;tance, which mu&s;t operate in con|junction with their natural partiality, to keep the former in ignorance of the genius and di&s;po&s;ition of the latter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Be&s;ides all this, his children had the general advantage of a father's example: they &s;aw the virtues he inculcated attended by all the con&s;e|quences in him&s;elf, which he had promi&s;ed them as their reward: piety in him was recompen&s;ed by peace of mind, benevolence by &s;elf-&s;atisfac|tion, and integrity by the ble&s;&s;ings of a good con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the time at la&s;t arrived, when his &s;on was to leave tho&s;e in|&s;tructions and that example, for the walks of more public life: as he was intended, or, more properly &s;peaking, &s;eemed to have an inclinati|on, for a learned profe&s;&s;ion, his father &s;ent him, in his twentieth year, to receive the fini&s;hings of education nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e, at one of the univer&s;ities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yet he had not, I have heard him &s;ay, the mo&s;t favourable opinion of the general cour&s;e of education there; but he knew, that a young man might there have an opportunity of acquiring much knowlege, if he were inclined to it; and that good principles might pre&s;erve him uncorrupted, even amid&s;t the dangers of &s;ome &s;urrounding di&s;&s;ipation&punc; be&s;ides, he had an additional inducement to this plan, from the repeat|ed reque&s;t of a di&s;tant relation, who filled an office of &s;ome con&s;equence at Oxford, and had expre&s;&s;ed a very earne&s;t de&s;ire to have his young kin&s;man &s;ent thither, and placed under his own immediate in&s;pection.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="018007_0016_0FA454976F9369B0">Before he &s;et out for that place, Anne&s;ly, though he had a &s;uf|ficient confidence in his &s;on, yet thought it not improper to mark out to him &s;ome of tho&s;e errors, to which the unexperienced are liable: he was not wont, as I have before ob&s;erved, to pre&s;s in|&s;truction upon his children; but the young man him&s;elf &s;eemed to expect it, with the &s;olicitude of one who ventured, not without anxiety, to leave that road, where the hand of a parent and friend had hitherto guided him in happine&s;s and &s;afety. The &s;ub&s;tance of what he delivered to his &s;on and daughter (for &s;he too was an audi|tor of his di&s;cour&s;es) I have endeavoured to collect from &s;ome of the papers Mrs. Wi&s;tanly put into my hands; and to arrange, as far as it &s;eemed arrangeable, in the two following chapters.</P>
<P>It will not, however, after all, have a perfectly-connected ap|pearance; becau&s;e, I imagine, it was delivered at different times, as occa&s;ion invited, or lei&s;ure allowed him; but its tendency ap|peared to be &s;uch, that, even under the&s;e di&s;advantages, I could not forbear in&s;erting it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Paternal in&s;tructions.&mdash;Of &s;u&s;picion and confidence. &mdash;Ridicule.&mdash;Religion.&mdash;True plea&s;ure.&mdash; Caution to the female &s;ex.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are now leaving us, my &s;on, &s;aid Anne&s;ly, to make your entrance into the world: for, though from the pale of a college, the bu&s;tle of ambition, the plodding of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the tin&s;el of gaiety, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be excluded; yet as it is the place where the per&s;ons that are to perform in tho&s;e &s;everal charac|ters often put on the dre&s;&s;es of each, there will not be wanting, even there, tho&s;e qualities that di&s;tingui&s;h in all. I will not &s;hock your imagination with the picture which &s;ome men, retired from its in|fluence, have drawn of the world; nor warn you again&s;t enormi|ties, into which, I &s;hould equally affront your under&s;tanding and your feelings, did I &s;uppo&s;e you capable of falling.</P>
<P>Neither would I arm you with that &s;u&s;picious caution, which young men are &s;ometimes advi&s;ed to put on: they who always &s;u&s;|pect will often be mi&s;taken, and never be happy. Yet there is a wide di&s;tinction between the confidence which becomes a man, and the &s;implicity that di&s;graces a fool: he who never tru&s;ts is a nig|gard of his &s;oul, who &s;tarves him&s;elf, and by whom no other is en|riched; but he who gives every one his confidence, and every one his prai&s;e, &s;quanders the fund that &s;hould &s;erve for the encourage|ment of integrity, and the reward of excellence.</P>
<P>In the circles of the world your notice may be frequently attract|ed by objects glaring, not u&s;eful; and your attachment won to

characters, who&s;e &s;urfaces are &s;howy, without intrin&s;ic value: in &s;uch circum&s;tances be careful not always to impute knowlege to the appearance of acutene&s;s, or give credit to opinions according to the confidence with which they are urged. In the more impor|tant articles of belief or conviction, let not the flow of ridicule be mi&s;taken for the force of argument.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o ea&s;y as to excite a laugh, at that time of life, when &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s is held to be an incapacity of enjoying it; and no wit &s;o futile, or &s;o dangerous, as that which is drawn from the per|verted attitudes of what is in it&s;elf momentous. There are in mo&s;t &s;ocieties a &s;et of &s;elf-important young men, who borrow con&s;e|quence from &s;ingularity, and take precedency in wi&s;dom from the unfeeling u&s;e of the ludicrous; this is at be&s;t a &s;hallow quality; in objects of eternal moment, it is poi&s;onous to &s;ociety. I will not now, nor could you then, &s;tand forth armed at all points to repel the attacks which they may make on the great principles of your belief; but let one &s;ugge&s;tion &s;uffice, exclu&s;ive of all internal evi|dence, or extrin&s;ic proof of revelation.</P>

The way we tread is rugged at be&s;t; we tread it, however, lighter by the pro&s;pect of that better country to which we tru&s;t it will lead; tell us not that it will end in the gulph of eternal di&s;&s;olution, or break off in &s;ome wild, which fancy may fill up as &s;he plea&s;es, but rea&s;on is unable to delineate; quench not that beam, which, amid&s;t the night of this evil world, has cheared the de&s;pondency of ill-requited worth, and illumined the darkne&s;s of &s;uffering virtue.</P>
<P>The two great movements of the &s;oul, which the molder of our frames has placed in them for the incitement of virtue and the pre|vention of vice, are the de&s;ire of honour, and the fear of &s;hame: but the perver&s;ion of the&s;e qualities, which the refinement of &s;o|ciety is peculiarly unhappy in making, has drawn their influence from the &s;tandard of morality, to the banners of its oppo&s;ite; into the fir&s;t &s;tep on which a young man ventures, in tho&s;e paths which the cautions of wi&s;dom have warned him to avoid, he is common|ly pu&s;hed by the fear of that ridicule which he has &s;een levelled at &s;implicity, and the de&s;ire of that applau&s;e which the &s;pirit of the profligate has enabled him to acquire.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure is in truth &s;ub&s;ervient to virtue. When the fir&s;t is pur|&s;ued without tho&s;e re&s;traints which the la&s;t would impo&s;e, every in|fringement we make on them le&s;&s;ens the enjoyment we mean to attain; and nature is thus wi&s;e in our con&s;truction, that, when we would be ble&s;&s;ed beyond the pale of rea&s;on, we are ble&s;&s;ed im|perfectly. It is not by the roar of riot, or the &s;hout of the bac|chanal,
<PB N="19" REF="018007_0018_0FA45498EB4E9410">
that we are to mea&s;ure the degree of plea&s;ure which he feels; the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the &s;en&s;e he gratifies is equally in&s;u&s;cepti|ble of the enjoyment, as it is deaf to the voice of rea&s;on; and, obdurated by the repetition of debauch, is incapable of that de|light which the finer &s;en&s;ations produce, which thrills in the bo&s;om of delicacy and virtue.</P>
<P>Libertines have &s;aid, my Harriet, that the &s;miles of your &s;ex at|tend them: and that the pride of conque&s;t, where conque&s;t is dif|ficult, overcomes the fear of di&s;grace and defeat. I hope there is le&s;s truth in this remark than is generally imagined; let it be my Harriet's belief that it cannot be true for the honour of her &s;ex: let it be her care that, for her own honour, it may be fal&s;e as to her.</P>
<P>Look on tho&s;e men, my child, even in their gaye&s;t and mo&s;t al|luring garb, as creatures dangerous to the peace, and de&s;tructive of the welfare of &s;ociety; look on them as you would on a beauti|ful &s;erpent, who&s;e mi&s;chief we may not forget while we admire the beauties of its &s;kin. I marvel indeed how the pride of the fair can allow them to &s;how a partiality to him, who regards them as be|ings merely &s;ub&s;ervient to his plea&s;ure, in who&s;e opinion they have lo&s;t all that dignity which excites reverence, and that excellence which creates e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Be accu&s;tomed, my love, to think re&s;pectfully of your&s;elf; it is the error of the gay world to place your &s;ex in a &s;tation &s;omewhat unworthy of a rea&s;onable creature; and the individuals of ours who addre&s;s them&s;elves to you, think it a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in their di&s;cour&s;e, that it &s;hould want every &s;olid property with which &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding would inve&s;t it. The character of a female pedant is undoubtedly di&s;gu&s;ting; but it is much le&s;s common than that of a trifling or an ignorant woman: the intercour&s;e of the &s;ex is, in this re&s;pect, advantageous, that each has a de&s;ire to plea&s;e, mingled with a certain deference for the other; let not this pur|po&s;e be lo&s;t on one &s;ide, by its being &s;uppo&s;ed, that, to plea&s;e yours, we mu&s;t &s;peak &s;omething, in which fa&s;hion has &s;anctified folly, and ea&s;e lent her garb to in&s;ignifiance.</P>
<P>In general it &s;hould never be forgotten, that, though life has its venial triflles, yet they cea&s;e to be innocent when they encroach upon its important concerns; the mind that is often employed a|bout little things, will be rendered unfit for any &s;erious exertion; and, though temporary relaxations may recruit its &s;trength, habitual vacancy will de&s;troy it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. In continuation. &mdash; Of knowlege. &mdash; Knowlege of the world. &mdash; Politene&s;s. &mdash; Honour. &mdash; Another rule of action &s;ugge&s;ted.</HEAD>
<P>AS the mind may be weakened by the pur&s;uit of trivial matters, &s;o its &s;trength may be mi&s;led in deeper inve&s;ti|gations.</P>
<P>It is a capital error in the pur&s;uit of knowlege, to &s;uppo&s;e that we are never to believe what we cannot account for. There is no rea&s;on why we &s;hould not attempt to under&s;tand every thing; but to own in &s;ome in&s;tances our limited knowlege, is a piece of mode&s;ty in which lies the true&s;t wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Let it be our care that our effort in its tendency is <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> and our effort need not be repre&s;&s;ed; for he that attempts the impo&s;&s;i|ble, will often atchieve the extremely difficult; but the pride of knowlege often labours to gain what if gained would be u&s;ele&s;s, and wa&s;tes exertion upon objects that have been left unattained from their futility. Men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this de&s;ire, you may per|haps find, my &s;on, in that &s;eat of &s;cience whither you are going: but remember, that what claims our wonder, does not always me|rit our regard; and in knowlege and philo&s;ophy be careful to di&s;|tingui&s;h, that the purpo&s;e of re&s;earch &s;hould ever be fixed on mak|ing &s;imple what is ab&s;tru&s;e, not ab&s;tru&s;e what is &s;imple; and that difficulty in acqui&s;ition will no more &s;anctify its inexpediency, than the art of tumblers, who have learned to &s;tand on their heads, will prove that to be the proper po&s;ture for man.</P>
<P>There is a pedantry in being ma&s;ter of paradoxes contrary to the common opinions of mankind, which is equally di&s;gu&s;ting to the illiterate and the learned. The pea&s;ant who enjoys the beauty of the tulip, is equally delighted with the philo&s;opher, though he knows not the powers of the rays from which its colours are derived; and the boy who &s;trikes a ball with his racket, is as certain whither it will be driven by the blow, as if he were perfectly ver&s;ant in the di&s;pute about matter and motion.</P>
<P>Vanity of our knowlege is generally found in the fir&s;t &s;tages of its acquirement, becau&s;e we are then looking back to that rank we have left, of &s;uch as know nothing at all. Greater advances cure us of this, by pointing our view to tho&s;e above us; and when we reach the &s;ummit, we begin to di&s;cover, that human know|lege is &s;o imperfect, as not to warrant any vanity upon it. In par|ticular arts beware of that affectation of &s;peaking technically, by which ignorance is often di&s;gui&s;ed, and knowlege di&s;graced. They who are really &s;kilful in the principles of &s;cience, will acquire the veneration only of &s;hallow minds by talking &s;cientifically; for, to &s;implify expre&s;&s;ion, is always the effect of the deepe&s;t knowlege,
<PB N="21" REF="018007_0020_0FA4549DB2195CF8">
and the cleare&s;t di&s;cernment. On the other hand, there may be many who po&s;&s;e&s;s ta&s;te, though they have not attained &s;kill; who, if they will be contented with the expre&s;&s;ion of their own feelings, without labouring to keep up the borrowed phra&s;e of erudition, will have their opinions re&s;pected by all who&s;e &s;uffrages are worthy of being gained. The mu&s;ic, the painting, the poetry of the pa&s;|&s;ions, is the property of every one who has a heart to be moved; and though there may be particular modes of excellence which national or temporary fa&s;hions create, yet that &s;tandard will ever remain which alone is common to all.</P>
<P>The o&s;tentation of learning is indeed always di&s;gu&s;ting in the in|tercour&s;e of &s;ociety; for even the benefit of in&s;truction received cannot allay the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inferiority, and remarkable parts more frequently attract admiration than procure e&s;teem. To bring forth knowlege agreeably, as well as u&s;efully, is perhaps very dif|ficult for tho&s;e, who have attained it in the &s;ecluded walks of &s;tudy and &s;peculation, and is an art &s;eldom found but in men who have likewi&s;e acquired &s;ome knowlege of the world.</P>
<P>I would however di&s;tingui&s;h between that knowlege of the world that fits us for intercour&s;e with the better part of mankind, and that which we gain by a&s;&s;ociating with the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>But there is a certain learned ru&s;t which men as well as metals acquire; it is, &s;imply &s;peaking, a blemi&s;h in both; the &s;ocial feelings grow callous from di&s;u&s;e, and we lo&s;e that &s;pring of little affections, which &s;weeten the cup of life as we drink it.</P>
<P>Even the ceremonial of the world, &s;hallow as it may appear, is not without its u&s;e; it may indeed take from the warmth of friend|&s;hip, but it covers the coldne&s;s of indifference; and if it has repre&s;|&s;ed the genuine overflowings of kindne&s;s, it has &s;mothered the turbulence of pa&s;&s;ion and animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Politene&s;s taught as an art is ridiculous; as the expre&s;&s;ion of liberal &s;entiment and courteous manners, it is truly valuable. There is a politene&s;s of the heart which is confined to no rank, and dependent upon no education: the de&s;ire of obliging, which a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this quality will univer&s;ally &s;how, &s;eldom fails of plea&s;ing, though his &s;tile may differ from that of modern refine|ment. I knew a man in London, of the gentle&s;t manners, and of the mo&s;t winning deportment; who&s;e eye was ever brightened with the &s;miles of good humour, and who&s;e voice was mellowed with the tones of complacency; &mdash; and this man was bred a black|&s;mith!</P>
<P>The fal&s;ehood of politene&s;s is often pleaded for, as unavoidable in the commerce of mankind; yet I would have it as little in|dulged as po&s;&s;ible. There is a frankne&s;s without ru&s;ticity, an open|ne&s;s of manner, prompted by good-humour, but guided by deli|ency, which &s;ome are happy enough to po&s;&s;e&s;s, that engages every worthy man, and gives not offence even to tho&s;e, who&s;e good opinion, though of little e&s;timation, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of prudence not wantonly to lo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="018007_0021_0FA4549F94AA1D88">The circles of the gay, my children would &s;mile to hear me talk of qualities which my retired manner of life has allowed me &s;o little opportunity of ob&s;erving; but true good breeding is not confined within tho&s;e bounds to which their pedantry (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) would re&s;trict it: true good-breeding is the &s;i&s;ter of philanthropy, with feelings perhaps not &s;o &s;erious or tender, but equally in&s;pired by a finene&s;s of &s;oul, and open to the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;ocial affection.</P>
<P>As politene&s;s is the rule of the world's manners, &s;o has it erect|ed <HI>Honour</HI> the &s;tandard of its morality; but its dictates too fre|quently depart from wi&s;dom with re&s;pect to our&s;elves, from ju&s;tice and humanity with re&s;pect to others. Genuine honour is undoubt|edly the offspring of both; but there has ari&s;en a counterfeit, who, as he is more boa&s;tful and &s;howy, has more attracted the notice of gaiety and grandeur. Genero&s;ity and courage are the virtues he boa&s;ts of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; but his genero&s;ity is a fool, and his courage a murderer.</P>
<P>The punctilio's indeed on which he depends, for his own peace, and the peace of &s;ociety, are &s;o ridiculous in the eye of rea&s;on, that it is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing, how &s;o many millions of rea&s;onable beings &s;hould have &s;anctified them with their mutual con&s;ent and acquie&s;cence; that they &s;hould have agreed to &s;urround the &s;eats of friend&s;hip, and the table of fe&s;tivity, with &s;o many thorns of inquietude, and &s;nares of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>You will probably hear, my &s;on, very frequent applau&s;e be&s;tow|ed on men of nice and jealous honour, who &s;uffer not the &s;malle&s;t affront to pa&s;s unque&s;tioned or unrevenged; but do not imagine that the character which is mo&s;t &s;acredly guarded, is always the mo&s;t un&s;ullied in reality, nor allow your&s;elf to envy a reputation for that &s;ort of valour which &s;upports it. Think how unea&s;ily that man mu&s;t pa&s;s his time, who &s;its, like a &s;pider in the mid&s;t of his feeling web, ready to catch the minute&s;t occa&s;ion for quarrel and re&s;entment.</P>
<P>There is often more real pu&s;illanimity in the mind that &s;tarts in|to oppo&s;ition where none is nece&s;&s;ary, than in him who overlooks the wanderings of &s;ome unguarded act or expre&s;&s;ion, as not of con|&s;equence enough to challenge indignation or revenge. I am aware, that the young and high-&s;pirited will &s;ay, that men can only judge of actions, and that they will hold as cowardice, the blindne&s;s I would recommend to affront or provocation; but there is a &s;teady coolne&s;s and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one's &s;elf, which this principle will com|monly be&s;tow, equally remote from the weakne&s;s of fear, and the di&s;compo&s;ure of anger, which gives to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a &s;tation that &s;eldom &s;ails of commanding re&s;pect, even from the ferocious vota|ries of &s;anguinary <HI>Honour.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome principle is required to draw a line of action, above the mere precepts of moral equity,
<Q><L>Beyond the fixt and &s;ettled rules;</L></Q>
and for this purpo&s;e is in&s;tituted the motive of <HI>Honour:</HI> &mdash; there is

another at hand, which the &s;ub&s;titution of this phantom too often de&s;troys &mdash; it is <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> &mdash; who&s;e voice, were it not &s;tifled (&s;ome|times by this very fal&s;e and &s;purious <HI>Honour</HI>) would lead directly to that liberal con&s;truction of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ules of morality which is here contended for.</P>
<P>Let my children never &s;uffer this monitor to &s;peak unheeded, nor drown its whi&s;pers, amid&s;t the din of plea&s;ure, or the bu&s;tle of life.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Introducing a new and capital Character.</HEAD>
<P>IT was thus the good man in&s;tructed his children. But, be|hold! the enemy came in the night and &s;owed tares!</P>
<P>Such an enemy had the harmle&s;s family of which Anne&s;ly was the head. It is ever to be regretted, that mi&s;chief is &s;eldom &s;o weak but that worth may be &s;lung by it; in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, however, it was &s;upported by talents mi&s;applied and ingenuity perverted.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Sindall enjoyed an e&s;tate of 5000 l. a year in An|ne&s;ly's pari&s;h. His father left him, when but a child, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an e&s;tate to the amount we have ju&s;t mentioned, and of a very large &s;um of money be&s;ides, which his economy had &s;aved him from its produce. His mother, though a very good woman, was a very bad parent; &s;he loved her &s;on, as too many mothers do, with that in&s;tinctive affection which nature has be&s;towed on the lowe&s;t rank of creatures.</P>
<P>She loved him as her &s;on, though he inherited none of her vir|tues; and becau&s;e &s;he happened to have no other child, &s;he reared this in &s;uch a manner, as was mo&s;t likely to prevent the comfort he might have afforded her&s;elf, and the u&s;efulne&s;s of which he might have been to &s;ociety. In &s;hort, he did what he liked, at fir&s;t becau&s;e his &s;pirit &s;hould not be confined too early, and afterwards he did what he liked, becau&s;e it was pa&s;t being confined at all.</P>
<P>But his temper was not altogether of that fiery kind, which &s;ome young men, &s;o circum&s;tanced, and &s;o educated, are po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of. There was a degree of prudence which grew up with him from a boy, that tempered the &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion to make its object more &s;ure in the acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>When at &s;chool, he was always the conductor of mi&s;chief, though he did not often participate in its execution; and his car|riage to his ma&s;ter was &s;uch, that he was a favourite without any

abilities at a &s;cholar, and acquired a character for regularity, while his a&s;&s;ociates were daily flogged for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which he had guided in their progre&s;s, and enjoyed the fruits of in their com|pletion. There &s;ometimes aro&s;e &s;u&s;picions of the reality; but even tho&s;e who di&s;covered them mingled a certain degree of prai&s;e with their cen&s;ure, and prophe&s;ied, that he would be <HI>A Man of the World.</HI></P>
<P>As he advanced in life, he fa&s;hioned his behaviour to the differ|ent humours of the gentlemen in the neighbourhood; he hunted with the fox-hunters through the day, and drank with them in the evening. With the&s;e he diverted him&s;elf at the expence of the &s;ober prigs, as he termed them, that looked after the improvement of their e&s;tates when it was fair, and read a book within doors when it rained; and to-morrow he talked on farming with this latter cla&s;s, and ridiculed the hunting phra&s;es, and boi&s;terous mirth of his ye&s;terday's companions.</P>
<P><HI>They were very well plea&s;ed to laugh at one another, while he laughed in his &s;leeve at both. This was &s;ometimes di&s;covered, and people were going to be angry&mdash;but &s;omebody &s;aid in excu&s;e that Sindall was</HI> A Man of the World.</P>
<P><HI>While the Oxford terms la&s;ted, (to which place he had gone in the cour&s;e of modern education) there were frequent reports in the country of the di&s;&s;ipated life he led; it was even &s;aid that he had di&s;appeared from college for &s;ix weeks together, during which time he was &s;u&s;pect|ed of having taken a trip to London with another man's wife; this was only mentioned in a whi&s;per; it was loudly denied; people doubt|ed at fir&s;t, and &s;hortly forgot it. Some little extravagances they &s;aid he might have been guilty of. It was impo&s;&s;ible for a man of two and twenty to &s;eclude him&s;elf altogether from company; and you could not look for the temperance a hermit in a young baronet of</HI> 5000 <HI>l. a year. It is indi&s;pen&s;able for &s;uch a man to come forth into life a little; with</HI> 5000 <HI>l. a year, one mu&s;t be</HI> A Man of the World.</P>
<P><HI>His fir&s;t tutor, who&s;e learning was as exten&s;ive, as his manners were pure, left him in di&s;gu&s;t; &s;ober people wondered at this; but he was &s;oon provided with another with whom he had got acquainted at Oxford: one whom every body declared to be much fitter for the tuiti|on of young Sindall, being like his pupil,</HI> A Man of the World.</P>
<P><HI>But though his extravagance in &s;quandering money, under the tuition of this gentleman, was frequently complained of, yet it was found that he was not altogether thoughtle&s;s of its acqui&s;ition. Upon the &s;ale of an e&s;tate in his neighbourhood, it was di&s;covered that a very advan|tageous mortgage, which had &s;tood in the name of another, had been really tran&s;acted for the benefit of young Sindall. His prudent friends plumed them&s;elves upon this intelligence; and according to their u&s;e of the phra&s;e, began to hope, that, after &s;owing his wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ats, &s;ir Tho|mas would turn out</HI> A Man of the World.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. The Footing on which he &s;tood with Anne&s;ly and his Family.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH &s;uch a man as we have de&s;cribed might be reckoned a valuable acquaintance by many, he was other|wi&s;e reckoned by Anne&s;ly; he had heard enough (though he had heard but part) of his character, to con&s;ider him as a dangerous neighbour; but it was impo&s;&s;ible to avoid &s;ometimes &s;eeing him, from who&s;e father he had got the living which he now occupied. There is no tax &s;o heavy on a little man, as an acquaintance with a great one. Anne&s;ly had found this in the life-time of Sir Wil|liam Sindall. He was one of tho&s;e whom the general voice pro|nounces to be a good &s;ort of man, under which denomination I never look for much &s;en&s;e, or much delicacy.</P>
<P>In fact the baronet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but little of either; he lived ho&s;pit|ably for his own &s;ake, as well as that of his gue&s;ts, becau&s;e he liked a good dinner and a bottle of wine after it; and in one part of ho&s;pitality he excelled, which was, the faculty of making every body drunk that had not uncommon fortitude to with&s;tand his at|tacks. Anne&s;ly's cloth protected him from this la&s;t inconvenience; but it often drew from Sir William a &s;et of je&s;ts, which his memo|ry had enabled him to retain, and had pa&s;&s;ed through the heirs of his family, like their e&s;tate, down from the days of that mon|arch of facetious memory, Charles the Second.</P>
<P>Though to a man of Anne&s;ly's delicacy all this could not but be highly di&s;agreeable, yet gratitude made him Sir William's gue&s;t often enough to &s;how that he had not forgot that attention which his pa&s;t favours demanded; and Sir William recollected them from another motive, to wit, that they gave a &s;anction to tho&s;e liberties he &s;ometimes u&s;ed with him who had received them.</P>
<P>This might have been held &s;ufficient to have cancelled the ob|ligation; but Anne&s;ly was not wont to be directed by the ea&s;ie&s;t rules of virtue; the impre&s;&s;ion &s;till remained, and it even de&s;cend|ed to the &s;on after the death of the father.</P>
<P>Sindall therefore was a frequent gue&s;t at his hou&s;e; and, though it might have been imagined, that the di&s;&s;ipated mind of a young man of his fortune would have found but little delight in Anne&s;|ly's humble &s;hed, yet he &s;eemed to enjoy its &s;implicity with the highe&s;t reli&s;h; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed indeed that pliancy of di&s;po&s;ition that could wonderfully accommodate him&s;elf to the humour of every one around him; and he &s;o managed matters in his vi&s;its to An|ne&s;ly, that this la&s;t began to imagine the reports he had heard con|cerning him, to be either entirely fal&s;e, or at lea&s;t aggravated much beyond truth.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="018007_0025_0FA456D49C5B3760">From what motive &s;oever Sindall began the&s;e vi&s;its, he &s;oon di&s;|covered a very &s;trong inducement to continue them. Harriet An|ne&s;ly was now arrived at the &s;ize, if not the age of womanhood; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an uncommon degree of beauty and elegance of form. In her face joined to the mo&s;t perfect &s;ymmetry of features was a melting expre&s;&s;ion, &s;uited to that &s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul we have men|tioned her to be endowed with.</P>
<P>In her per&s;on, rather above the common &s;ize, &s;he exhibited a degree of ea&s;e and gracefulne&s;s which nature alone had given, and art was not allowed to dimini&s;h. Upon &s;uch a woman Sindall could not look with indifference; and according to his principles of libertini&s;m, he had marked her as a prey, which his &s;ituation gave him opportunities of pur&s;uing, and which one day he could not fail to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of his acquaintance he began to di&s;cover, that the &s;oftne&s;s of her &s;oul was di&s;tant from &s;implicity, and that much art would be nece&s;&s;ary to overcome a virtue, which the hand of a parent had carefully fortified. He a&s;&s;umed therefore the &s;emblance of tho&s;e tender feelings, which were mo&s;t likely to gain the e&s;teem of the daughter, while he talked with that appearance of candour and principle, which he thought nece&s;&s;ary to procure him the confidence of the father.</P>
<P>He would frequently confe&s;s, with a &s;igh, that his youth had been &s;ometimes unwarily drawn into error; then gra&s;p Anne&s;ly's hand, and looking earne&s;tly in his face, beg him to &s;trengthen by his coun&s;el the good re&s;olutions which he thanked heaven he had been enabled to make. Upon the whole, he continued to gain &s;uch a degree of e&s;timation with the family, that the young folks &s;poke of his &s;eeming good qualities with plea&s;ure, and their father mentioned his &s;uppo&s;ed foibles with regret.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Young Anne&s;ly goes to Oxford &mdash; The Friend&s;hip of Sindall &mdash; Its Con&s;equences.</HEAD>
<P>UPON its being determined that young Anne&s;ly &s;hould go to Oxford, Sir Thomas &s;hewed him remarkable kindne&s;s and attention. He conducted him thither in his own carriage; and as his kin&s;man, to who&s;e charge he was committed, happen|ed accidentally to be for &s;ome time unable to a&s;&s;ign him an apart|ment in his hou&s;e, Sindall quitted his own lodging to accommodate him.</P>
<P>To a young man newly launched into life, removed from the only &s;ociety he had ever known, to another compo&s;ed of &s;tangers, &s;uch a&s;&s;iduity of notice could not be but highly plea&s;ing; and in his letters to his father he did not fail to &s;et forth, in the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="018007_0026_0FA456D52B877690">
manner, the obligations he had to &s;ir Thomas. His father, whom years had taught wi&s;dom, but who&s;e warmth of gratitude they had not dimini&s;hed, felt the favour as acutely as his &s;on; nor did the fore&s;ight of meaner &s;ouls ari&s;e in his brea&s;t to abate its acknowledg|ment.</P>
<P>The hopes which he had formed of his Billy were not di&s;appoint|ed. He very &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the univer&s;ity for learn|ing and genius; and in the corre&s;pondence of his kin&s;man were recited daily in&s;tances of the notice which his parts attracted. But his prai&s;e was cold in compari&s;on with Sindall's; he wrote to An|ne&s;ly of his young friend's acquirement and abilities, in a &s;train of enthu&s;ia&s;tic encomium; and &s;eemed to &s;peak the language of his own enjoyment, at the applau&s;e of others which he repeated. It was on this &s;ide that Anne&s;ly's &s;oul was acce&s;&s;ible, for on this &s;ide lay that pride which is the weakne&s;s of all. On this &s;ide did Sindall overcome it.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e very qualities al&s;o which he applauded in the &s;on, he derived the temptation with which he meant to &s;educe him; for &s;uch was the plan of exqui&s;ite mi&s;chief he had formed; be&s;ides the common de&s;ire of depravity to make pro&s;elytes from innocence, he con&s;idered the virtue of the brother as that &s;tructure on the ruin of which he was to accompli&s;h the conque&s;t of the &s;i&s;ter's. He introduced him therefore into the company of &s;ome of the mo&s;t artful of his own a&s;&s;ociates, who loudly echoed the prai&s;es he lavi&s;hed on his friend, and &s;hewed, or pretended to &s;hew, that value for his acquaintance, which was the &s;tronge&s;t recommenda|tion of their own.</P>
<P>The diffidence which Anne&s;ly's youth and inexperience had at fir&s;t laid upon his mind, they removed by the encouragement which their approbation of his opinions be&s;towed; and he found him&s;elf indebted to them both for an ea&s;e of delivering his &s;enti|ments, and the reputation which their &s;uffrages conferred upon them.</P>
<P>For all this, however, they expected a return; and Anne&s;ly had not fortitude to deny it&mdash; an indulgence for &s;ome trivial irre|gularities which they now and then permitted to appear in their conver&s;ation. At fir&s;t their new acquaintance took no notice of them at all; he found that he could not approve, and it would have hurt him to condemn.</P>
<P>By degrees he began to allow them his laugh, though his &s;oul was little at ea&s;e under the gaiety which his features a&s;&s;umed &mdash; once or twice when the majority again&s;t him appeared to be &s;mall, he ventured to argue, though with a caution of giving offence, a|gain&s;t &s;ome of the &s;entiments he heard.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions Sindall artfully joined him in the argu|ment; but they were always overcome. He had to deal with men who were &s;killed, by a mere act of the memory, in all the &s;ophi&s;ms which voluptuaries have framed to ju&s;tify the unbounded pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure; and tho&s;e who had not learning to argue, had a&s;&s;u|rance
<PB N="28" REF="018007_0027_0FA456D6CE6E7928">
to laugh. Yet Anne&s;ly's conviction was not changed; but the edge of his abhorrence to vice was blunted; and though his virtue kept her po&s;t, &s;he found her&s;elf galled in maintaining it.</P>
<P>It was not till &s;ome time after, that they ventured to &s;olicit his participation of their plea&s;ures; and it was not till after many &s;o|licitations that his innocence was overcome. But the progre&s;s of their victories was rapid after his fir&s;t defeat. And he &s;hortly at|tained the &s;tation of experienced vice, and began to a&s;&s;ume a &s;u|periority from the undauntedne&s;s with which he practi&s;ed it.</P>
<P>But it was nece&s;&s;ary, the while, to deceive that relation under who&s;e in&s;pection his father had placed him; in truth it was no very hard matter to deceive him. He was a man of that ab&s;tracted di&s;po&s;ition, that it &s;eldom conver&s;ant with any thing around it. Simplicity of manners was, in him, the effect of an apathy in his con&s;titution (encrea&s;ed by con&s;tant &s;tudy) that was proof again&s;t all violence of pa&s;&s;ion or de&s;ire; and he thought, if he thought of the matter at all, that all men were like him&s;elf, who&s;e indolence could never be overcome by the plea&s;ure of pur&s;uit, or the joys of attainment.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, Mr. Lumley, that tutor of Sindall's whom we have formerly mentioned, was a man the be&s;t calculated in the world for lulling his &s;u&s;picions a&s;leep, if his nature had ever al|lowed them to ari&s;e. This man, who&s;e parts were of that pliable kind that ea&s;ily acquire a &s;uperficial knowlege of every thing, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the talent of hypocri&s;y as deeply as the de&s;ire of plea&s;ure; and while in reality he was the mo&s;t profligate of men, he had that command of pa&s;&s;ion, which never &s;uffered it to intrude where he could wi&s;h it concealed; he pre&s;erved in the opinion of Mr. Jeph|&s;on, the gravity of a &s;tudious and contemplative character which was &s;o congenial to his own: and he would often ri&s;e from a me|taphy&s;ical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion with the old gentleman, leaving him in ad|miration of the depth of his reading, and the acutene&s;s of his parts, to join the debauch of Sindall and his di&s;&s;olute companions.</P>
<P>By his a&s;&s;i&s;tance therefore Anne&s;ly's di&s;&s;ipation was effectually &s;creened from the notice of his kin&s;man; Jeph&s;on was even pre|vailed on by fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions to write to the country continued en|comiums on his &s;obriety and application to &s;tudy; and the father, who was happy in believing him, enquired no farther.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. A very gro&s;s attempt is made on Anne&s;ly's honour.</HEAD>
<P>SINDALL having brought the mind of his pro&s;elyte to that conformity of &s;entiment to which he had thus laboured to re|duce it, ventured to di&s;cover to him the pa&s;&s;ion he had conceived
<PB N="29" REF="018007_0028_0FA456D820821CF0">
for his &s;i&s;ter. The occa&s;ion, however, on which he di&s;covered it, was &s;uch a one as he imagined gave him &s;ome title to be li&s;ten|ed to.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly had an allowance &s;ettled on him by his father, rather in truth above what his circum&s;tances might warrant with propriety&punc; but as the feelings of the good man's heart were, in every virtuous purpo&s;e, &s;omewhat beyond the limitations of his fortune, he in|clined rather to pinch him&s;elf, than to &s;top any channel through which advantage might flow to his &s;on; and meant his education and his manners to be in every re&s;pect liberal and accompli&s;hed. But this allowance ill &s;ufficed to gratify the extravagance which his late connexion had taught him; he began very &s;oon to know a want which he had never hitherto experienced: at fir&s;t this not on|ly limited his plea&s;ures, but began to check the de&s;ire of them, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;erved to awaken that &s;en&s;e of contrition, which their rotation had before overcome.</P>
<P>But Sindall took care that he &s;hould not be thus left to reflexion; and as &s;oon as he gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e, prevented its continuance by an immediate &s;upply, offered, and indeed urged, with all the open warmth of di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip. From being accu&s;tomed to receive, Anne&s;ly at la&s;t overcame the &s;hame of a&s;king, and ap|plied repeatedly for &s;ums, under the denomination of loans, for the payment of which he could only draw upon contingency. His nece&s;&s;ities were the more frequent, as, among&s;t other arts of plea|&s;ure which he had lately acquired, that of gaming had not been omitted.</P>
<P>Having one night lo&s;t a &s;um, con&s;iderably above what he was able to pay, to a member of their &s;ociety with whom he was in no degree of intimacy, he gave him his note payable the next morn|ing (for this was the regulated limitation of their credit) though he knew that to morrow would find him as poor as to-night. On the&s;e particular occa&s;ions, when his hours would have been &s;o highly irregular, that they could not e&s;cape the cen&s;ure of Mr. Jeph&s;on, or his family, he u&s;ed to pretend, that, for the &s;ake of di&s;entangling &s;ome point of &s;tudy with Sindall and his tutor, he had pa&s;&s;ed the night with them at their lodgings, and what &s;mall portion of it was allowed for &s;leep he did actually &s;pend there. Af|ter this lo&s;s therefore, he accompanied Sindall home, and could not, it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, conceal from him the &s;hagreen it occa&s;ioned. His friend as u&s;ual advanced him money for di&s;charg|ing the debt.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly, who never had bad occa&s;ion to borrow &s;o much from him before, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow at the nece&s;&s;ity which his honour laid him under, of accepting &s;o large a &s;um. Poh! an&s;wered Sindall, 'tis but a trifle, and what a man mu&s;t now and then lo&s;e to be thought genteelly of. "Yes, if his fortune can afford i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">" &s;aid the other gloomily. Ay, there's the rub, returned his friend;
<PB N="30" REF="018007_0029_0FA456D8475B6470">
that fortune &s;hould have con&s;tituted an inequality where nature made none. How ju&s;t is the complaint of Ja&s;&s;ier,
<Q><L>Tell me why, good heav'n!</L>
<L>Thou m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d'&s;t me what I am, with all the &s;pirit,</L>
<L>A&s;piring thoughts and elegant de&s;ires,</L>
<L>That fill the happie&s;t man?</L></Q>
That &s;uch &s;hould be the lot of my friend, I can regret &mdash; thanks to my better &s;tars, I can more than regret it. What is the value of this dro&s;s (holding a handful of gold) but to make the &s;ituation of merit level with its de&s;ervings! Yet, believe me, there are wants which riches cannot remove, de&s;ires which &s;ometimes they cannot &s;atisfy; even at this moment, your &s;eeming-happy Sindall, in who&s;e lap fortune has poured her ble&s;&s;ings, has his cares, my Anne&s;ly has his inquietudes, which need the hand of friend&s;hip to comfort and to &s;ooth."</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly, with all the warmth of his nature, in&s;i&s;ted on par|taking his unea&s;ine&s;s, that if he could not alleviate, he might at lea&s;t condole with his di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Sindall embraced him; "I know your friend&s;hip, &s;aid he, and I will put it to the proof. You have a &s;i&s;ter, the lovely, the ador|able Harriet; &s;he has robb'd me of that peace which the &s;mile of fortune cannot re&s;tore, as her frown has been unable to take away! did you know the burnings of this bo&s;om! but I &s;peak unthinking|ly what perhaps my delicacy &s;hould not have whi&s;pered, even in the ear of friend&s;hip. Pardon me&mdash;the ardor of a love like mine may be forgiven &s;ome extravagance."</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly's eyes &s;ufficiently te&s;tified his inward &s;atisfaction at this di&s;covery, but he recollected the dignity which his &s;ituation requir|ed, and replied calmly, "that he pretended no guidance of his &s;i&s;ter's inclinations; that his own gratitude for &s;ir Thomas's fav|ours he had ever loudly declared; and that he knew his &s;i&s;ter felt enough on his account, to make the introduction of her brother's friend a more than u&s;ually favourable one."</P>
<P>"But my &s;ituation, returned Sindall, is extremely particular; you have heard my opinions on the &s;core of love often declared; and tru&s;t me, they are the genuine &s;entiments of my heart. The trammels of form, which the unfeeling cu&s;tom of the world has thrown upon the freedom of mutual affection, are in&s;upportable to that finene&s;s of &s;oul, to which re&s;traint and happine&s;s are terms of oppo&s;ition. Let my mi&s;tre&s;s be my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;till, with all the pri|vileges of a wife, without a wife's indifference or a wife's di&s;quiet. &mdash;My fortune the property of her and her friends, but that liberty alone re&s;erved, which is the &s;tronge&s;t bond of the affection &s;he &s;hould wi&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s from me."&mdash;</P>
<P>He looked &s;tedfa&s;tly in Anne&s;ly's face, which by this time began to a&s;&s;ume every mark of re&s;entment and indignation. He eyed him a&s;cant with an affected &s;mile: &mdash; "You &s;mile, &s;ir," &s;aid An|ne&s;ly,
<PB N="31" REF="018007_0030_0FA456D8F787BE78">
who&s;e breath was &s;tifled by the &s;welling of his heart &mdash; Sin|dall laugh'd aloud: "I am a wretched hypocrite, &s;aid he, and could contain my&s;elf no longer." "So you were but in je&s;t, it &s;eems," replied the other, &s;ettling his features into a dry compo|&s;ure.</P>
<P>"My dear Anne&s;ly, returned he, had you but &s;een the counte|nance this trial of mine gave you; it would have made a picture worthy of the gallery of Florence. I wanted to have a perfect idea of &s;urprize, indignation, &s;truggling friend&s;hip, and &s;welling hon|our, and I think I &s;ucceeded. &mdash; But I keep you from your re&s;t &mdash; Good night&mdash;and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> walked out of the room."</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly had felt too much to be able to re&s;ign him&s;elf &s;peedily to re&s;t; he could not but think this joke of his friend rather a &s;erious one; yet he had &s;een him &s;ometimes carry this &s;pecies of wit to a very extraordinary length; but the indelicacy of the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance was not to be ea&s;ily accounted for &mdash; he doubted, be|lieved, was angry, and pacified by turns; the remembrance of his favours aro&s;e; they aro&s;e at fir&s;t in a form that added to the malignity of the offence; then the &s;eries in which they had been be&s;towed, &s;eem'd to plead on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when worn by the fighting of contrary emotions, he look'd forward to the con&s;equences of a rupture with Sindall; the plea&s;ures of that &s;ociety of which he was the leader, the habitual tie which it had got on Anne&s;ly's &s;oul, prevail'd; for he had by this time lo&s;t that &s;atisfaction which was wont to flow from him&s;elf. He &s;hut his mind again&s;t the &s;ugge&s;tions of any further &s;u&s;picion, and, with that winking cowardice, which many mi&s;take for re&s;o|lution, was re&s;olved to tru&s;t him for his friend, whom it would have hurt him to con&s;ider as an enemy.</P>
<P>Sindall, on the other hand, di&s;covered that the youth was not &s;o entirely at his di&s;po&s;al as he had imagined him; and that though he was pro&s;elyte enough to be wicked, he mu&s;t be led a little farther to be u&s;eful.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Anne&s;ly gives farther proofs of depravity of man|ners. The effect it has on his father, and the con&s;equences with regard to his connexion with Sindall.</HEAD>
<P>TO continue that train of di&s;&s;ipation, in which their pupil had been initiated, was the bu&s;ine&s;s of Sindall and his a&s;&s;ociates. Though they contrived, as we have before mentioned, to e&s;cape the immediate notice of Mr. Jeph&s;on, yet the eyes of others could not be &s;o ea&s;ily blinded; the behaviour of Anne&s;ly began to be
<PB N="32" REF="018007_0031_0FA456D9AD74B418">
talk'd of for its irregularity, and the more &s;o, for the change which it had undergone from that &s;implicity of manners which he had brought with him to Oxford. And &s;ome one, whether from regard to him, or what other motive I know not, informed his kin&s;man of what every one but his kin&s;man &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Upon this information he gave the young man a lecture in the u&s;ual terms of admonition; but an effort was always painful to him, even where the office was more agreeable than that of reproof. He had recour&s;e therefore to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his fellow-philo&s;opher Mr. Lumley, whom he informed of the accounts he had received of Anne&s;y's imprudence, and entreated to take the proper mea|&s;ures, from his influence with the young gentleman, to make him &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of his pa&s;t conduct, and to prevent its continuance for the future.</P>
<P>Lumley expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize at this intelligence, with unpar|allel'd command of features; regretted the too prevailing di&s;&s;ipa|tion of youth, affected to doubt the truth of the accu&s;ation, but promi&s;ed at the &s;ame time, to make the proper enquiries into the fact, and take the mo&s;t prudent method of preventing a con&s;e|quence &s;o dangerous, as that of drawing from the road of his du|ty, one whom he believed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many good quali|ties as Mr. Anne&s;ly.</P>
<P>Whether Mr. Lumley employed his talents towards his reforma|tion or degeneracy, it is certain that Anne&s;ly's conduct betrayed many marks of the latter; at la&s;t, in an hour of intoxication, hav|ing engaged in a quarrel with one of his companions, it produced con&s;equences &s;o notorious, that the proctor could not fail to take notice of it; and that officer of the univer&s;ity having interpo&s;ed his authority, in a manner which the humour of Anne&s;ly, inflammable as it then was, could not brook, he broke forth into &s;ome extra|vagances &s;o per&s;onally offen&s;ive, that when the matter came to be canva&s;&s;ed, nothing &s;hort of expul&s;ion was talk'd of as a puni&s;h|ment for the offence.</P>
<P><HI>It was then that Mr. Jeph&s;on fir&s;t informed his father of tho&s;e irre|gularities which his &s;on had been guilty of. His father indeed, from the di&s;continuance of that gentleman's corre&s;pondence much beyond the u&s;ual time, had begun to make &s;ome unfavorable conjectures; but he ac|counted for this neglect from many different cau&s;es; and when once his ingenuity had taken that &s;ide of the argument, it quickly found means to convince him that his kin&s;man's &s;ilence could not be imputed to any fault of his &s;on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was at the clo&s;e of one of their &s;olitary meals that this account of Jeph&s;on's happened to reach Anne&s;ly and his daughter. Harriet never forgot her Billy's health, and &s;he had now filled her father's gla&s;s to the accu&s;tomed pledge, when the &s;ervant brought them a letter with the Oxford mark on it. Read it, my love, &s;aid Anne&s;ly, with a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ile, while he began to blame his &s;u&s;picious at the &s;ilence of his kin&s;man. Harriet began reading accordingly, but &s;he had &s;earc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> got through the fir&s;t &s;entence, when the matter it contained rendered her voice inarti|culate.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="018007_0032_0FA456DA7B2DA880"><HI>Her father took the letter cut of her hand, and after peru&s;ing it, he put it in his pocket, keeping up a look of compo&s;ure amid&s;t the angui&s;h with which his heart was wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng.

<P><HI>"I will go, &s;aid &s;he, &s;obbing and pray for him the while." An|ne&s;ly &s;at down to write &mdash; "My deare&s;t boy!" &mdash; 'twas a movement grown mechanical to his pen&mdash;he da&s;ht through the words, and a tear fell on the place; &mdash;ye know not, ye who revel in the wantonne&s;s of di&s;|&s;ipation, and &s;coff at the &s;olicitude of parental affection! ye know not the agony of &s;uch a tear; el&s;e &mdash; ye are men, and it were beyond the depravity of nature.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was not till after more than one blotted &s;crawl, that he was able to write, what the man might claim, and the parent &s;hould approve. The letter which he at la&s;t determined to &s;end was of the following tenor:</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Anne&s;ly was ju&s;t about to di&s;patch the&s;e letters, when he receiv|ed one expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;ympathizing terms from &s;ir Thomas Sindall. That young gentleman, after touching, in the tendere&s;t manner, on the pain which a father mu&s;t feel from the errors of his children, admini&s;tered the only comfort that was left to admi|ni&s;ter, by repre&s;enting, that young Anne&s;ly's fault had been exag|gerated much beyond the truth, and that it was entirely owing to the effects of a warm temper, accidentally inflamed with liquor, and provoked by &s;ome degree of in&s;olence in the officer to whom the outrage had been offer'd; he particularly regretted that his pre|&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition towards &s;obriety, had prevented him&s;elf from being pre&s;ent at that meeting, in which ca&s;e, he &s;aid, he was pretty cer|tain this unlucky affair had never happened; that, as it was, the only thing left for his friend&s;hip to do, was to amend what it had not lain within his power to prevent; and he begg'd, as a te&s;timo|ny of the old gentleman's regard, that he might honour him &s;o far as to commit to him the care of &s;etting matters to rights with regard to the character of his &s;on, which he hoped to be &s;oon able effec|tually to re&s;tore.</P>
<P>The earlie&s;t con&s;olation which a man receives after any calami|ty is hallowed for ever in his regard, as a benighted traveller care&s;&s;es the dog who&s;e barking fir&s;t announced him to be near the habitations of men.</P>
<P>It was &s;o with Anne&s;ly; his un&s;u&s;pecting heart overflowed with gratitude towards this friend of his &s;on, and he now grew lavi&s;h of his confidence towards him, in proportion as he recollected hav|ing once (in his pre&s;ent opinion unju&s;tly) denied it.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="018007_0034_0FA45DBBBA36D118">He returned therefore an an&s;wer to &s;ir Thomas, with all tho&s;e genuine expre&s;&s;ions of acknowledgment, which the hone&s;t emotions of his &s;oul could dictate; he accepted, as the greate&s;t obligation, that concern which he took in the welfare of his &s;on, and chearful|ly repo&s;ed on his care the tru&s;t which his friend&s;hip de&s;ired; and as a proof of it, he inclo&s;ed to him the letter he had wrote to William, to be delivered at what time, and enforced in what man|ner, his prudence &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. The plan which Sindall forms for obliterating the &s;tain which the character of his friend had &s;uffered.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Thomas did accordingly deliver this letter of Anne&s;ly's to his &s;on; and as the penitence which the young man then felt for his recent offence, made the a&s;&s;umption of a character of &s;obrie|ty proper, he accompanied this paternal remon&s;trance with advices of his own, dictated alike by friend&s;hip and prudence.</P>
<P>They were at this time, indeed, but little nece&s;&s;ary; in the in|terval between the paroxy&s;ms of plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation, the genuine feelings of his nature had time to ari&s;e; and, awakened as they now were by the letters of his father and &s;i&s;ter, their voice was irre&s;i&s;tible: he ki&s;s'd the &s;ignature of their names a thou&s;and times, and, weeping on Sindall's neck, imprecated the wrath of heaven on his own head, that could thus heap affliction on the age of the be&s;t of parents.</P>
<P>He expre&s;s'd at the &s;ame time his intention of leaving Oxford, and returning home, as an immediate in&s;tance of his de&s;ire of re|formation. Sir Thomas, though he gave all the prai&s;e to this pur|po&s;e which its filial piety de&s;erved, yet doubted the propriety of putting it in execution; he &s;aid, that in the little circles of the country, Anne&s;ly's penitence would not &s;o immediately blot out his offence, but that the weak and the illiberal would &s;hun the contagi|on, as it were, of his company, and that he would meet every day with affronts and neglects, which the &s;incerity of his repentance ill de&s;erved, and his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of that &s;incerity might not ea&s;ily b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ook.</P>
<P>He told him, that a young gentleman, a friend of his, who was ju&s;t going to &s;et out on a tour abroad, had but a few days before written to him, de&s;iring his recommendation of &s;ome body, with the manners and education of a gentleman, to accompany him on his travels, and that he believed he could ea&s;ily procure that &s;tation for his friend; which would have the double advantage, of remov|ing him from the obloquy to which the late accident had &s;ubjected
<PB N="36" REF="018007_0035_0FA45DBC3239C5D8">
him, and of improving him in every re&s;pect, by the opportunity it would give, of ob&s;erving the laws, cu&s;toms, and poli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of our neighbours on the Continent.</P>
<P>While the depre&s;&s;ion produced by Anne&s;ly's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his offences remained &s;trong upon his mind, this propo&s;al met with no very warm reception; but, in proportion as the comfort and en|couragement of his friend prevailed, the ambition, which a man of his age naturally feels to &s;ee &s;omething of the world, began to &s;peak in its behalf; he mentioned however the con&s;ent of his father as an indi&s;pen&s;able preliminary. This &s;ir Thomas allowed to be ju&s;t, and &s;howing him that confidential letter which the old gen|tleman had written him, undertook to mention this &s;cheme for his approbation in the an&s;wer he intended making to it.</P>
<P>In this too was enclo&s;ed his young friend's return to the letters of his father and &s;i&s;ter, which were contained in the preceding chapter; full of that contrition which, at the time, he really felt, and of tho&s;e good re&s;olutions which, at the time, he &s;incerely formed. As to the matter of his going abroad, he only touch'd on it as a plan of &s;ir Thomas Sindall's, who&s;e friend&s;hip had dictated the propo&s;al, and who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gment of its expediency his own words were to contain.</P>
<P>His father received it, not without tho&s;e pangs, which the thought of &s;eparation from a &s;on, on whom the peace of his &s;oul re&s;ted, mu&s;t cau&s;e; but he examined it with that impartiality which his wi&s;dom &s;ugge&s;ted in every thing that concerned his children: "My own &s;atisfaction, he would often &s;ay, has for its object only the few years of a waning life; the &s;ituation of my children, my hopes would extend to the importance of a much longer period."</P>
<P>He held the balance therefore in an even hand; the arguments of Sindall had much of the &s;pecious, as his inducement to u&s;e them had much of the friendly. The young gentleman, whom Billy was to accompany, had connexions of &s;uch weight in the &s;tate, that the faire&s;t pro&s;pects &s;eemed to open from their patronage; nor could the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e of that argument be denied, which &s;uppo&s;ed con|veniency in the change of place to Anne&s;ly at the pre&s;ent, and im|provement for the future.</P>
<P>There were not however wanting &s;ome con&s;iderations of rea&s;on to &s;ide with a parent's tears again&s;t the journey: but Sindall had an&s;wers for them all; and at la&s;t he wrung from him his &s;low leave, on condition that William &s;hould return home, for a &s;ingle day, to bid the la&s;t farewell to his father and his Harriet.</P>
<P>Mean time the puni&s;hment of Anne&s;ly's late offence in the univer&s;ity was mitigated by the intere&s;t of Sindall, and the inter|ce&s;&s;ion of Mr. Jeph&s;on. Expul&s;ion, which had before been in&s;i&s;t|ed on, was changed into a &s;entence of le&s;s indignity, to wit, that of being publickly reprimanded by the head of the college to which he belonged; after &s;ubmitting to which, he &s;et out, accompanied by &s;ir Thomas, to bid adieu to his father's hou&s;e, preparatory to his going abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="018007_0036_0FA45DBCEFAFE2C0">His father at meeting touch'd on his late irregularities with that delicacy, of which a good mind cannot dive&s;t it&s;elf, even amid&s;t the propo&s;ed &s;everity of reproof: and, having thus far &s;acrificed to ju&s;tice and parental authority, he opened his &s;oul to all that warmth of affection which his Billy had always experienced; nor was the mind of his &s;on yet &s;o preverted by his former cour&s;e of di&s;&s;ipation, as to be in&s;en&s;ible to that &s;ympathy of feelings which this indulgence &s;hould produce. The tear which he offered to it was the &s;acrifice of his heart; wrung by the recollection of the pa&s;t, and &s;welling with the purpo&s;e of the future.</P>
<P>When the morning of his departure arrived, he &s;tole &s;oftly into his father's chamber, meaning to take leave of him without being &s;een by his &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e tenderne&s;s of &s;oul could not ea&s;ily bear the pangs of a &s;olemn farewell.</P>
<P>He found his father on his knees. &mdash; The good man, ri&s;ing with that &s;erene dignity of a&s;pect which tho&s;e &s;acred duties ever conferred on him, turned to his &s;on: "You go, my boy, &s;aid he, to a di&s;tant land, far from the guidance and protection of your earthly parent; I was recommending you to the care of him who is at all times pre&s;ent with you: though I am not &s;uper&s;titious, yet, I confe&s;s, I feel &s;omething about me as if I &s;hould never &s;ee you more; if the&s;e are my la&s;t words, let them be trea&s;ur'd in your re|membrance&mdash;Live as becomes a man, and a chri&s;tian; live as be|comes him who is to live for ever!"</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, his daughter entered the room. "Ah! my Billy, &s;aid &s;he, could you have been &s;o cruel as to go without &s;eeing your Harriet? it would have broken my heart! oh! I have much to &s;ay and many farewells to take; yet now methinks I can &s;ay nothing, and &s;carce dare bid you farewell!" &mdash; "My children, interrupted her father, in this cabinet is a pre&s;ent I have always intended for each of you; and this, which is perhaps the la&s;t time we &s;hall meet together, I think the fitte&s;t to be&s;tow them. Here, my Har|riet, is a miniature of that angel your mother; imitate her virtues, and be happy.&mdash;Here, my Billy, is its counterpart, a picture of your father; whatever he is, heaven knows his affection to you; let that endear the memorial, and recommend that conduct to his &s;on which will make his father's grey hairs go down to the grave in peace!" Tears were the only an&s;wer that either could give. An|ne&s;ly embraced his &s;on and ble&s;s'd him.</P>
<P>Harriet blubber'd on his neck! Twice he offered to go, and twice the agony of his &s;i&s;ter pulled him back; at la&s;t &s;he flung her|&s;elf into the arms of her father, who beckoning to &s;ir Thomas Sin|dall, ju&s;t then arrived to carry off his companion, that young gen|tleman, who was him&s;elf not a little affected with the &s;cene, took his friend by the hand, and led him to the carriage that waited them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. He reaches London, where he remains longer than was expected. The effects of his &s;tay there.</HEAD>
<P>IN a few days Anne&s;ly and his friend the baronet arrived in the metropolis. His father had been informed, that the gentle|man whom he was to accompany in his travels was to meet him in that city, where they propo&s;ed to remain only a week or two; for the purpo&s;e of &s;eeing any thing curious in town, and of &s;etttling &s;ome points of accommodation on their rout through the countries they meant to vi&s;it: an intelligence he confe&s;&s;ed very a|greeable to him, becau&s;e he knew the temptations to which a young man is expo&s;ed by a life of idlene&s;s in London.</P>
<P>But, in truth, the intention of &s;ir Thomas Sindall never was, that his pre&s;ent pupil (if we may &s;o call him) &s;hould travel any farther. The young gentleman, for who&s;e companion he had pre|tended to engage Anne&s;ly, was indeed to &s;et out very &s;oon after on the tour of Europe; but he had already been provided with a tra|velling governor, who was to meet him upon his arrival at Calais (for the air of England agreed &s;o ill with this gentleman's con&s;ti|tution, that he never cro&s;s'd the channel) and who had made the &s;ame journey, &s;everal times before, with &s;ome Engli&s;h young men of great fortunes, whom he had the honour of returning to their native country, with the &s;ame &s;overeign contempt for it that he him&s;elf entertained.</P>
<P>The purpo&s;e of Sindall was merely to remove the &s;on to a &s;till greater di&s;tance from his father, and to a &s;cene where his own plan, of entire conver&s;ion, &s;hould meet with every aid, which the &s;ociety of the idle and the profligate could give it.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time, however, he found the di&s;po&s;ition of Anne&s;ly aver&s;e to his de&s;igns. The figure of his father venerable in virtue, of his &s;i&s;ter lovely in innocence, were imprinted on his mind; and the variety of public places of entertainment, to which &s;ir Thomas conducted him, could not immediately efface the impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But as their novelty at fir&s;t delighted, their frequency at la&s;t &s;ubdued him; his mind began to accu&s;tom it&s;elf to the hurry of thoughtle&s;s amu&s;ement, and to feel a painful vacancy, when the bu&s;tle of the &s;cene was at any time changed for &s;olitude. The un|re&s;trained warmth and energy of his temper, yielded up his under|&s;tanding to the company of fools, and his re&s;olutions of reforma|tion to the &s;ociety of the di&s;&s;olute, becau&s;e it caught the fervor of the pre&s;ent moment, before rea&s;on could pau&s;e on the di&s;po&s;al of the next; and, by the indu&s;try of Sindall, he found, every day, a &s;et of friends, among whom the mo&s;t engaging were always the mo&s;t licentious, and joined to every thing which the good dete&s;t, every thing which the unthinking admire.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="018007_0038_0FA45DBF5CBC9140">I have often indeed been tempted to imagine, that there is &s;ome|thing unfortunate, if not blameable, in that har&s;hne&s;s and au&s;teri|ty, which virtue too often a&s;&s;umes; and have &s;een, with regret, &s;ome excellent men, the authority of who&s;e under&s;tanding, and the attraction of who&s;e wit, might have retained many a de&s;erter under the banners of goodne&s;s, lo&s;e all that power of &s;ervice, by the unbending di&s;tance which they kept from the little plea&s;antries and &s;weetne&s;&s;es of life.</P>
<P>This conduct may be &s;afe, but there is &s;omething ungenerous and cowardly in it; to keep their forces, like an over-cautious com|mander, in fa&s;tne&s;&s;e&s;s, and fortified towns, while they &s;uffer the enemy to wa&s;te and ravage the champaign. Prai&s;e is indeed due to him, who can any way pre&s;erve his integrity; but &s;urely the heart that can retain it, even while it opens to all the warmth of &s;ocial feeling, will be an offering more acceptable in the eye of heaven.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly was di&s;tant from any coun&s;el or example, that might counterbalance the contagious influence of the di&s;&s;olute &s;ociety, with which his time was now engro&s;s'd; but his &s;eduction was not complete, till the better principles, which his &s;oul &s;till retained, were made acce&s;&s;ary to its accompli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Sindall procured a woman infamous enough for his purpo&s;e, the ca&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s of one of his former companions, whom he tutored to invent a plau&s;ible &s;tory of di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;fortune, which he con|trived, in a manner &s;eemingly accidental, to have communicated to Anne&s;ly. His native compa&s;&s;ion, and his native warmth, were intere&s;ted in her &s;ufferings and her wrongs; and he applauded him&s;elf for the protection which he afforded her, while &s;he was the abandoned in&s;trument of his undoing.</P>
<P>After having retained, for &s;ome time, the purity of her guar|dian and protector, in an hour of intoxication he ventured to ap|proach her on a loo&s;er footing; and &s;he had afterwards the addre&s;s to make him believe, that the weakne&s;s of her gratitude had grant|ed to him, what to any other her virtue would have refu&s;ed; and during the criminal intercour&s;e in which he lived with her, &s;he continued to maintain a character of affection and tenderne&s;s, which might excu&s;e the guilt of her own conduct, and account for the infatuation of his.</P>
<P>In this fatal connexion every remembrance of that weeping home which he had &s;o lately left, with the re&s;olutions of penitence and re|formation, was era&s;ed from his mind; or, if at times it intruded, it came not that gentle gue&s;t, at who&s;e approach his bo&s;om u&s;ed to be thrilled with reverence and love, but approached in the form of &s;ome ungracious monitor, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to bani&s;h plea&s;ure and awaken remor&s;e; and, therefore, the next amu&s;ement, folly, or vice, was called in to his aid to bani&s;h and expel it. As it was &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to write to his father, he fell upon an expe|dient, even to &s;ave him&s;elf the pain of thinking &s;o long as that purpo&s;e required, on a &s;ubject now grown &s;o irk&s;ome to him, and
<PB N="40" REF="018007_0039_0FA45DC04AD70A28">
employed that woman, in who&s;e toils he was thus &s;hamefully en|tangled, to read the letters he received, and dictate &s;uch an&s;wers as her cunning could &s;ugge&s;t, to mi&s;lead the judgment of his un|&s;u&s;pecting parent.</P>
<P>All this while Sindall artfully kept &s;o much aloof, as to pre&s;erve, even with the &s;on, &s;omething of that character which he had ac|quired with the father; he was often ab&s;ent from parties of re|markable irregularity, and &s;ometimes ventured a gentle cen&s;ure on his friend for having been led into them. But while he &s;eemed to check their continuance under this cloak of prudence, he en|couraged it in the report he made of the voice of others; for while the &s;cale of character, for temperance, &s;obriety, and morals, &s;inks on one &s;ide, there is a balance of fame in the mouths of part of the world ri&s;ing on the other&mdash;Anne&s;ly could bear to be told of his &s;pirit, his genero&s;ity, and his honour.</P>

<P>THE manner of life which Anne&s;ly now pur&s;ued without re&s;traint. was nece&s;&s;arily productive of &s;uch expence as he could very ill afford. But the craft of his female a&s;&s;ociate was not much at a lo&s;s for pretences, to make frequent demands on the genero&s;sity of his father. The &s;ame excu&s;es which &s;erved to account for his &s;tay in London, in &s;ome mea&s;ure apologized for the large|ne&s;s of the &s;ums he drew for; if it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to remain there, expence, if not unavoidable, was at lea&s;t difficult to be avoid|ed; and for the cau&s;es of his &s;tay in that city he had only to repeat the accounts, which he daily received from Sindall, of various acci|dents which obliged his young friend to po&s;tpone his intended tour.</P>
<P>Though in the country there was little opportunity of knowing the town-irregularities of Anne&s;ly, yet there were not wanting &s;ur|mi&s;es of it among &s;ome, of which it is likely his father might have heard enough to alarm him, had he not been at this time in &s;uch a &s;tate of health as prevented him from much &s;ociety with his neighbours; a &s;low aguei&s;h di&s;order, which followed tho&s;e &s;ymp|toms his daughter's letter to her brother had de&s;cribed, having confined him to his chamber almo&s;t con&s;tantly from the time of his &s;on's departure.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly had &s;till &s;ome blu&s;hes left, and when he had pu&s;h'd his father's indulgence, in the article of &s;upply, as far as &s;hame would allow him, he look'd round for &s;ome other &s;ource whence pre&s;ent relief might be drawn, without daring to con&s;ider how the arrearages of the future &s;hould be cancelled. Sindall for &s;ome

time an&s;wered his exigences without reluctance; but at la&s;t he in|formed him, as he &s;aid with regret, that he could not from parti|cular circum&s;tances afford him, at that immediate juncture, any further a&s;&s;i&s;tance than a &s;mall &s;um, which he then put into Anne&s;|ly's bands, and which the very next day was &s;quandered by the pro|digality of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The next morning he ro&s;e without knowing how the wants of the day were to be provided for, and &s;trolling out into one of his accu&s;tomed walks, gave him&s;elf up to all the pangs, which the re|tro&s;pect of the pa&s;t, and the idea of the pre&s;ent, &s;ugge&s;ted. But he felt not that contrition which re&s;ults from ingenuous &s;orrow for our offences; his &s;oul was ruled by that gloomy demon, who looks only to the angui&s;h of their puni&s;hment, and accu&s;es the hand of providence, for calamity which him&s;elf has occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation he was met by one of his new-acquired friends, who was walking off the oppre&s;&s;ion of la&s;t night's riot. The mel|ancholy of his countenance was &s;o ea&s;ily ob&s;ervable, that it could not e&s;cape the notice of his companion, who rallied him on the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of his a&s;pect, in the cant-phra&s;e of tho&s;e brutes of our &s;pecies, who are profe&s;&s;ed enemies to the faculty of thinking. Though Anne&s;ly's pride for a while kept him &s;ilent, it was at la&s;t overcome by the other's importunity, and he confe&s;&s;ed the de&s;pera|tion of his circum&s;tances to be the cau&s;e of his pre&s;ent depre&s;&s;ion. His companion, who&s;e pur&s;e, as him&s;elf informed Anne&s;ly, had been flu&s;hed by the &s;ucce&s;s of the preceding night, animated by the liberality which attends &s;udden good fortune, freely offered him the u&s;e of twenty pieces till better times &s;hould enable him to repay them.</P>
<P>"But, &s;aid he gayly, it is a &s;hame for a fellow of your parts to want money, when fortune has provided &s;o many rich fools for the harve&s;t of the wi&s;e and the indu&s;trious. If you'll allow me to be your conductor this evening, I will &s;how you where, by the traffic of your wits, in a very &s;hort time you may convert the&s;e twenty guineas into fifty."</P>
<P>"At play," replied Anne&s;ly coolly. "Ay at play, returned the other, and fair play too: 'tis the only profe&s;&s;ion left for a man of &s;pirit and honour to pur&s;ue: to cheat as a merchant, to quib|ble as a lawyer, or to cant as a churchman, is confined to fellows who have no fire in their compo&s;ition. Give me but a bold &s;et, and a fair throw for it, and then for the life of a lord, or the death of a gentleman."</P>
<P>"I have had but little experience in the profe&s;&s;ion, &s;aid An|ne&s;ly, and &s;hould but throw away your money." "Never fear, replied the other; do but mark me, and I will en&s;ure you; I will &s;how you our men; pigeons, more pigeons, by Jupiter."</P>
<P>It was not for a man in Anne&s;ly's &s;ituation to balk the promi&s;e of &s;uch a golden opportunity; they dined together, and after|wards
<PB N="42" REF="018007_0041_0FA45DC3C9BFB658">
repaired to a gaming-hou&s;e, where Anne&s;ly's companion in|troduced him, as a friend of his, ju&s;t arrived from the country, to &s;everal young gentlemen who &s;eemed to be waiting his arrival. &mdash; "I promi&s;ed you your revenge, &s;aid he, my dears, and you &s;hall have it; &s;ome of my friend's Lady-day rents too have accompanied him to London; if you win, you &s;hall wear them. To bu&s;ine&s;s, to bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of their play, Anne&s;ly, though but moderately &s;killed in the game, di&s;covered that the company, to whom he had been introduced, were in reality &s;uch bubbles as his companion had repre&s;ented them; after being heated by &s;ome &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s in the beginning, they began to bet extravagantly again&s;t every calcula|tion of chances; and in an hour or two, his a&s;&s;ociate and he had &s;tripped them of a very con&s;iderable &s;um, of which his own &s;hare, though much the &s;maller, was upwards of three&s;core guineas. When they left the hou&s;e, he offered his conductor the &s;um he had lent him, with a profu&s;ion of thanks both for the u&s;e and the im|provement of it. "No, my boy, &s;aid he, not now; your note is &s;ufficient: I will rather call for it, when I am at a pinch; you &s;ee now the road to wealth and independence; you will meet me here to-morrow." He promi&s;ed to meet him accordingly.</P>
<P>They had been but a few minutes in the room this &s;econd night, when a gentleman entered, whom the company &s;aluted with the appellation of &s;quire: the greater part of them &s;eemed to be charmed with his pre&s;ence; but the countenance of Anne&s;ly's companion fell at his approach; "damn him, &s;aid he, in a whi&s;per to Anne&s;ly, he's a knowing one."</P>
<P>In &s;ome degree indeed he de&s;erved the title: for he had attained, from pretty long experience, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by natural quickne&s;s of parts, a con&s;iderable knowlege in the &s;cience; and in &s;trokes of genius, at games where genius was required, was excelled by few. But after all, he was far from being &s;ucce&s;sful in the profe&s;&s;ion&punc; na|ture intended him for &s;omething better; and as he &s;poiled a wit, an orator, and perhaps a poet, by turning gambler; &s;o he often &s;poiled a gambler by the ambition, which was not yet entirely quenched, of &s;hining occa&s;ionally in all tho&s;e characters. And as a companion, he was too plea&s;ing, and too well pleas'd, to keep that cool indifference, which is the characteri&s;tic of him, who &s;hould be always po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of him&s;elf, and con&s;ider every other man only as the &s;punge from whom he is to &s;queeze advantage.</P>
<P>To the pre&s;ent party, however, he was unque&s;tionably &s;uperior; and of cour&s;e in a &s;hort time began to levy large contributions, not only on the more inexperienced, whom Anne&s;ly and his con|ductor had mark'd for their own booty, but likewi&s;e on the&s;e two gentlemen them&s;elves, who&s;e winnings of the formes evening, were now fa&s;t dimini&s;hing before the &s;uperior &s;kill of this new antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>But, in the mid&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;s, he was interrupted by the arri|val of another gentleman, who &s;eem'd al&s;o to be a well-known
<PB N="43" REF="018007_0042_0FA45DC4CF377648">
character in this temple of fortune, being &s;aluted by the familiar name of Black-beard. This man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an unmoved equality both of temper and a&s;pect; and though in reality he was of no very &s;uperior abilities, yet had acquired the reputation both of depth and acutene&s;s, from being always accu&s;tomed to think on his own intere&s;t, and pur&s;uing with the mo&s;t &s;edulous attention every object which led to it, un&s;educed by one &s;ingle &s;park of tho&s;e feelings which the world terms Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the article of gaming, which he had early pitch'd on as the means of advancement, he had availed him&s;elf of that indu&s;try, and &s;aturnine complexion, to acquire the mo&s;t con&s;umate know|lege of its principles, which indeed he had attained to a very re|markable degree of perfection.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ed to this man, even the &s;kill of the hitherto-&s;ucce&s;sful &s;quire was unavailing; and con&s;equently he not only &s;tripp'd that gentleman of the gains he had made, but gleaned whatever he had left in the pur&s;es of the inferior members of the party, among&s;t whom Anne&s;ly and his a&s;&s;ociates were reduced to their la&s;t guinea.</P>
<P>This they agreed to &s;pend together at a tavern in the neighbour|hood, where they cur&s;ed fortune, their &s;poiler, and them&s;elves, in all the bitterne&s;s of rage and di&s;appointment. Anne&s;ly did not &s;eek to account for their lo&s;&s;es otherwi&s;e than in the real way, to wit, from the &s;uperior &s;kill of their adver&s;ary; but his companion, who often boa&s;ted of his own, threw out &s;ome in&s;inuations of foul play and connivance.</P>
<P>"If I thought that," &mdash; &s;aid Anne&s;ly, laying his hand on his &s;word, while his cheeks burnt with indignation.&mdash;"Poh! replied the other, 'tis in vain to be angry; here's damnation to him in a bumper."</P>
<P>The other did not fail his pledge; and by a liberal application to the bottle, they &s;o far overcame their lo&s;&s;es, that Anne&s;ly reel'd home, &s;inging a catch, forgetful of the pa&s;t, and regardle&s;s of to-morrow.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Another attempt to retrieve his circum&s;tances, the con&s;equences of which are &s;till more fatal.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the arrival of to-morrow might be overlook'd, it could not be prevented. It ro&s;e on Anne&s;ly one of the mo&s;t wretched of mankind. Poverty, embittered by di&s;grace, was now approaching him, who knew of no friend to ward off the blow, and had no con&s;olation in him&s;elf by which it might be lightened: if any thing could add to his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, it was encrea&s;ed by the ab&s;ence of Sindall, who was then in the country,
<PB N="44" REF="018007_0043_0FA45DC52DF32348">
and the upbraidings of his female companion, who now exclaimed again&s;t the folly which her&s;elf had cau&s;ed, and the extravagance her&s;elf had participated.</P>
<P>About mid-day, his la&s;t night's fellow-&s;ufferer paid him a vi&s;it; their mutual &s;hagreen at meeting, from the recollection of misfor|tune which it produced, was evident in their countenances; but it was not a little encrea&s;ed, when the other told Anne&s;ly he came to put him in mind of the &s;um he had advanced him two days be|fore, for which he had now very particular occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly an&s;wered, that he had frankly told him the &s;tate of his finances at the time of the loan, and accepted it on no condition of &s;peedy payment; that he had, that &s;ame evening, offered to repay him when it was in his power, and that he could not but think the demand ungentlemanlike, at a time when he mu&s;t know his utter inability to comply with it.</P>
<P>"Ungentlemanlike! &s;aid the other; I don't under&s;tand what you mean &s;ir, by &s;uch a phra&s;e; will you pay me my money or not?" &mdash;"I cannot."&mdash;"Then, &s;ir, you mu&s;t expect me to employ &s;ome gentleman for the recovery of it, who will &s;peak to you, perhaps, in a more ungentlemanlike &s;tile than I do." And, &s;o &s;aying, he flung out of the room.</P>
<P>"Infamous wretch!" exclaimed Anne&s;ly, and walk'd about with a hurried &s;tep, gnawing his lip, and mattering cur&s;es on him, and on him&s;elf.&mdash;There was another gentleman wanted to &s;ee him below &s;tairs.&mdash;'Twas a mercer who came to demand pay|ment of &s;ome fineries his lady, as he termed her, had purcha&s;ed; he was, with difficulty, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. &mdash; In a quarter of an hour there was another call&mdash;'Twas a dun of a taylor for cloaths to him&s;elf&mdash; he would take no excu&s;e&mdash;"Come, &s;aid Anne&s;ly, with a look of de&s;peration, to-morrow morning, and I will pay you."&mdash;</P>
<P>But how?&mdash;he &s;tared wildly on the ground, then knocked his head again&s;t the wall, and acted all the extravagances of a mad|man, At la&s;t, with a more &s;ettled horror in his eye, he put on his &s;word, and without knowing whether he &s;hould go, &s;allied in|to the &s;treet,</P>
<P>He happened to meet in his way &s;ome of tho&s;e boon companions, with whom his nights of jollity had been &s;pent; but their terms of &s;alutation were &s;o cold and forbidding, as obviou&s;ly to &s;how that the account of his circum&s;tances had already reached them; and, with them, he who had every thing to a&s;k, and nothing to be&s;tow, could po&s;&s;e&s;s no quality attractive of regard.</P>
<P>After &s;auntering from &s;treet to &s;treet, and from &s;quare to &s;quare, he found him&s;elf towards the clo&s;e of the day within a few paces of that very gaming hou&s;e where he had been &s;o unfortunate the evening before. A &s;ort of malicious curio&s;ity, and &s;ome hope of he knew not what, tempted him to re-enter it. He found much the &s;ame company he had &s;een the preceding night, with the excep|tion, however, of his former a&s;&s;ociate, and one or two of the younger members of their party whom the &s;ame cau&s;e prevented from attending.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="018007_0044_0FA45DC5EC02D498">Strolling into another room, he found an inferior &s;et of game|&s;ters, who&s;e &s;takes were lower, though their vociferation was in|finitely more loud. In the far corner &s;at a man, who pre&s;erved a compo&s;ure of countenance, undi&s;turbed by the clamour and con|fu&s;ion that &s;urrounded him. After a little ob&s;ervation, Anne&s;ly di&s;covered that he was a money-lender, who advanced certain &s;ums at a very exorbitant premium to the per&s;ons engaged in the play. Some of tho&s;e he &s;aw, who could offer no other &s;ecurity &s;atisfying to this u&s;urer, procure a few guineas from him, on pawning a watch, a ring, or &s;ome other appendage of former finery. Of &s;uch he had before dive&s;ted him&s;elf for urgent demands, and had no|thing &s;uperfluous about him but his &s;word, which he had kept the late&s;t, and which he now depo&s;ited in the hands of the old gentle|man in the corner, who furni&s;hed him with a couple of pieces up|on it, that with them he might once more try his fortune at the table.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s exceeded his expectation; it was &s;o rapid, that in le&s;s than an hour he had encrea&s;ed his two guineas to forty, with which he determined to retire contented; but when he would have redeemed his &s;word, he was informed that the keeper of it had ju&s;t gone into the other room, where, as he entered to demand it, he unfortunately overheard the &s;ame gentleman who had gained his money the former night, offering a bet, to the amount of the &s;um Anne&s;ly then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, on a ca&s;t where he imagined the chance to be much again&s;t it. Stimulated with the de&s;ire of doubling his gain, and the &s;udden provocation, as it were, of the offer, he accepted it; and, in one moment, lo&s;t all the fruits of his former good-fortune.&mdash;The tran&s;port of his pa&s;&s;ion could not expre&s;s it&s;elf in words; but taking up one of the dice, with the &s;eeming coolne&s;s of exqui&s;ite angui&s;h, he fairly bit it in two, and ca&s;ting a look of frenzy on his &s;word, which he was now unable to ran&s;om, he ru&s;h'd out of the hou&s;e, uncover'd as he was, his hat hanging on a peg in the other apartment.</P>
<P>The agitation of his mind was &s;uch as denied all attention to com|mon things; and, in&s;tead of taking the direct road to his lodgings, he wandered off the &s;treet into an ob&s;cure alley, where he had not advanced far, till he was acco&s;ted by a fellow, who, in a very peremptory tone, de&s;ired him to deliver his money, or he would in&s;tantly blow out his brains, pre&s;enting a pi&s;tol at le&s;s than half a yard's di&s;tance.&mdash;"I can give you nothing, &s;aid Anne&s;ly, becau&s;e I have nothing to give."&mdash;"Damn you, return'd the other, do you think I'll be fobb'd off &s;o; your money, and be damn'd to you, or I'll &s;end you to hell in a twinkling"&mdash;advancing his pi&s;tol, at the &s;ame time, within a hand's breadth of his face. Anne&s;ly&punc; at that in&s;tant, &s;truck up the muzzle with his arm, and laying hold of the barrel, by a &s;udden wrench, forced the weapon out of the hands of the villain, who, not chu&s;ing to ri&s;k any farther com|bat, made the be&s;t of his way down the alley, and left Anne&s;ly ma&s;ter of his arms.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="018007_0045_0FA45DC6AA6C2738">He &s;tood for a moment entranc'd in thought.&mdash;"Whoever thou art, &s;aid he, I thank thee; by heaven, thou in&s;tructe&s;t and arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t me; this may provide for to-morrow, or make its provi&s;ion un|nece&s;&s;ary." He now returned with a hurried pace to the mouth of the alley, where in the &s;hade of a jutting wall he could mark unperceived the objects on the &s;treet.</P>
<P>He had &s;tood there but a few &s;econds, and began already to waver in his purpo&s;e, when he &s;aw come out of the gaming-hou&s;e, which he had left, the very man who had plundered him of his all. The richne&s;s of the prize, with immediate revenge, awakened to|gether in his mind; and the &s;u&s;picion of foul play, which his companion had hinted the night before, gave them a &s;anction of &s;omething like ju&s;tice: he waited till the chair, in which the game&s;ter was conveyed, came oppo&s;ite to the place where he &s;tood; then covering his face with one hand, and a&s;&s;uming a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one different from his natural, he pulled out his pi&s;tol, and commanded the leading chairman to &s;top.</P>
<P>This effected, he went up to the chair, and the gentleman with|in having let down one of the gla&s;&s;es to know the rea&s;on of its &s;top, the &s;topper clapp'd the pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, and threatened him with in&s;tant death, if he did not deliver his money. The other, after &s;ome little he&s;itation, during which Anne&s;ly repeated his threats, with the mo&s;t horrible oaths, drew a pur&s;e of gold from his pocket, which Anne&s;ly &s;natcht out of his hand, and running down the alley, made his e&s;cape at the other end; and, after turn|ing through &s;everal &s;treets, in different directions, &s;o as to elude pur&s;uit, arrived &s;afely at home with the booty he had taken.</P>
<P>Meantime the game&s;ter returned to the hou&s;e he had ju&s;t quitted, with the account of his di&s;a&s;ter. The whole fraternity, who could make no allowance for a robber of this &s;ort, were alarmed at the accident; every one was bu&s;ied in enquiry, and a thou&s;and que&s;ti|ons were a&s;ked about his appearance, his behaviour, and the rout he had taken.</P>
<P>The chairmen, who had been &s;omewhat more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them|&s;elves, at the time of the robbery, than their ma&s;ter, had remark|ed the circum&s;tance of the robber's wanting his hat: this was no &s;ooner mentioned, than a buz ran through the company, that the young gentleman, who had gone off a little while before, had been ob&s;erved to be uncovered when he left the hou&s;e; and upon &s;earch made, his hat was actually found with his name mark'd on the in&s;ide.</P>
<P>This was a ground of &s;u&s;picion too &s;trong to be overlooked: me&s;&s;engers were di&s;patched in que&s;t of the friend who had intro|duced him there the preceding night; upon his being found and acquainting them of Anne&s;ly's lodgings, proper warrants were ob|tained for a &s;earch.</P>
<P>When that unfortunate young man arrived at home, he was met <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the &s;tairs by the lady we have formerly mentioned; who, in
<PB N="47" REF="018007_0046_0FA45DC798DE8BF0">
terms of bitter reproach, interrupted with tears, inveighed again&s;t the cruelty of his neglect, in thus leaving her to pine alone, with|out even the common comforts of a mi&s;erable life. Her cen&s;ure indeed was the more violent, as there was little rea&s;on for its vio|lence; for &s;he had that moment di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at a back-door, a gallant who was more attentive than Anne&s;ly.</P>
<P>He, who could very well allow the grounds of her complaint, only pleaded nece&s;&s;ity for his excu&s;e; he could but mutter this apology in imperfect words, for the perturbation of his mind al|mo&s;t deprived him of the powers of &s;peech. Upon her taking no|tice of this, with much &s;eeming concern for his health, he beckon|ed her into a chamber, and da&s;hing the pur&s;e on the floor, pointed to it with a look of horror, as an an&s;wer to her upbraidings.</P>
<P>"What have you done for this?" &s;aid &s;he, taking it up: He threw him&s;elf into a chair, without an&s;wering a word.</P>
<P>At that moment the officers of ju&s;tice, who had lo&s;t no time in pro&s;ecuting their information, entered the hou&s;e; and &s;ome of them, accompanied by an attorney, employed by the gentleman who had been robbed, walked &s;oftly up &s;tairs to the room where Anne&s;ly was, and bur&s;ting into it before he could prepare for any defence, laid hold of him in rather a violent manner; which the lawyer ob&s;erving, de&s;ired them to u&s;e the gentleman civilly, till he &s;hould a&s;k him a few que&s;tions. "I will an&s;wer none, &s;aid Anne&s;ly; do your duty." "Then, &s;ir, replied the other, you mu&s;t attend us to tho&s;e who can que&s;tion you with better authority; and I mu&s;t make bold to &s;ecure this lady, till &s;he an&s;wer &s;ome que&s;tions al&s;o."</P>
<P>The lady &s;aved him the trouble; for being now pretty well &s;atisfied, that her heroe was at the end of his career, &s;he thought it mo&s;t prudent to break off a connexion where nothing was to be gained, and make a merit of contributing her endeavours to bring the offender to ju&s;tice. She called, therefore, this leader of the party into another room, and being informed by him that the young gentleman was &s;u&s;pected of having committed a robbery &s;carce an hour before, &s;he pulled out the pur&s;e which &s;he had ju&s;t received from him, and a&s;ked the lawyer, If it was that which had been taken from his client?</P>
<P>"Ay, that it is, I'll be &s;worn, &s;aid he; and here (pouring out its contents) is the ring he mentioned at the bottom."&mdash; "But, &s;aid &s;he, pau&s;ing a little, it will prove the thing as well without the guineas."</P>
<P>"I prote&s;t, returned the lawyer, thou art a girl of excellent invention &mdash; Hum &mdash; here are four&s;core; one half of them might have been &s;pent&mdash;or dropt out by the way, or&mdash;any thing may be &s;uppo&s;ed; and &s;o we &s;hall have twenty a piece.&mdash; Some folks to be &s;ure would take more, but I love con&s;cience in tho&s;e matters."</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="018007_0047_0FA45DCA8773B318">Having fini&s;hed this tran&s;action, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;uch a manner as might give no offence to the con&s;cience of this hone&s;t pettifogget, they return|ed to the pri&s;oner, who contented him&s;elf with darting a look of indignation at his female betrayer; and after being &s;ome time in the cu&s;tody of the lawyer and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants, he was carried, in the morning, along with her, before a magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>The &s;everal circum&s;tances I have related being &s;worn to, Anne&s;|ly was committed to Newgate, and the game&s;ter bound over to pro&s;ecute him at the next &s;e&s;&s;ions, which were not then very di&s;tant.</P>

<P>For &s;ome time, the whirling of his brain gave him no lei&s;ure to exerci&s;e any faculty that could be termed thinking; when that &s;ort of delirium &s;ub&s;ided, it left him only to make room for more ex|qui&s;ite, though le&s;s turbulent angui&s;h.</P>
<P>After he had vi&s;ited every corner of re&s;ource, and found them all dark and comfortle&s;s, he &s;tarted at la&s;t from that po&s;ture of de&s;pair in which he &s;at, and turning the glare of his eye intently upwards:</P>
<P>"Take back, &s;aid he, thou Power that gave&s;t me being! take back that life which thou did&s;t breathe into me for the be&s;t of pur|po&s;es, but which I have profaned by actions equally mi&s;chievous to thy government, and ignominious to my&s;elf. The pa&s;&s;ions which thou did&s;t implant in me, that rea&s;on which &s;hould balance them, is unable to with&s;tand: from one only I receive u&s;eful ad|monition; the &s;hame that could not prevent, now puni&s;hes my crimes. Her voice for once I will obey; and leave a &s;tate, in which, if I remain, I continue a blot to nature, and an enemy to man."</P>
<P>He drew a penknife, now his only weapon, from its &s;heath&mdash; he bared his bo&s;om for the horrid deed&mdash;when the picture of his father, which the good man had be&s;towed on him at parting, and he had worn ever &s;ince in his bo&s;om, &s;truck his eye&mdash;(it was drawn in the mildne&s;s of holy meditation, with the hands olded together,
<PB N="4" REF="018007_0050_0FA45DCD8F476468">
and the eyes lifted to heaven) "Merciful God!" &s;aid Anne&s;ly &mdash;he would have uttered a prayer; but his &s;oul was wound up to a pitch that could but one way be let down &mdash; he flung him&s;elf on the ground, and bur&s;t into an agony of tears.</P>
<P>The door of his apartment opening, di&s;covered the jailor, fol|lowed by &s;ir Thomas Sindall &mdash; "My friend in this place!" &s;aid he, to Anne&s;ly,&mdash;who covered his face with his hands, and replied only by a groan.</P>
<P>Sindall made &s;igns for the keeper of the pri&s;on to leave them;&mdash; "Come, &s;aid he, my dear Anne&s;ly, be not &s;o entirely overcome; I flatter my&s;elf, you know my friend&s;hip too well, to &s;uppo&s;e that it will de&s;ert you even here. I may, perhaps, have opportunities of comforting you in many ways; at lea&s;t I &s;hall feel and pity your di&s;tre&s;ses."&mdash;"Leave me, an&s;wered the other, leave me; I de&s;erve no pity, and methinks there is a pride in refu&s;ing it."&mdash; "You mu&s;t not &s;ay &s;o; my love has much to plead for you&punc; nor are you without excu&s;e even to the world." "Oh Sindall, &s;aid here I am without excu&s;e to my&s;elf! when I look back to that peace of mind, to that happine&s;s I have &s;quandered! &mdash; I will not cur&s;e, but &mdash; Oh! Fool, fool, fool!" &mdash; "I would not, &s;aid &s;ir Thomas encrea&s;e that angui&s;h which you feel, were I not obliged to mention the name of your father.</P>
<P>"My father! cried Anne&s;ly; O hide me from my father!&mdash; "Alas! replied Sindall, he mu&s;t hear of your di&s;a&s;ter from other hands; and it were cruel not to acquaint him of it in a way that &s;hould wound him the lea&s;t."&mdash;Anne&s;ly gazed with a look of en|trancement on his picture&punc; "Great God! &s;aid he, for what ha&s;t thou re&s;erved me&punc; Sindall, do what thou wilt&mdash;think not of &s;uch a wretch as I am; but mitigate if thou can&s;t, the &s;orrows of a father, the purity of who&s;e bo&s;om mu&s;t bleed for the vices of mine." "Fear not, returned &s;ir Thomas; I hope all will be better than you imagine It grows late, and I mu&s;t leave you now; but pro|mi&s;e me to be more compo&s;ed for the future. I will &s;ee you again early to morrow; nor will I let a moment e&s;cape, that can be im|proved to your &s;ervice."&mdash;"I mu&s;t think, &s;aid Anne&s;ly, and there|fore I mu&s;t feel; but I will often remember your friend&s;hip, and my gratitude &s;hall be &s;ome little, merit left in me to look upon without blu&s;hing."</P>
<P>Sindall bade him farewell, and retired; and at that in&s;tant he was le&s;s a villain than he u&s;ed to be. The &s;tate of horror to which he &s;aw this young man reduced, was beyond the limits of his &s;cheme; and he began to look upon the victim of his de&s;igns, with that pity which depravity can feel, and that remor&s;e which it can|not overcome.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. His father is acquainted with Anne&s;ly's &s;ituation. His behaviour in con&s;equence of it.</HEAD>
<P>THAT letter to old Anne&s;ly, which Sindall had undertaken to write, he found a more difficult ta&s;k than at fir&s;t he imagined. The &s;olicitude of his friend&s;hip might have been ea&s;ily expre&s;&s;ed on more common occa&s;ions, and hypocri&s;y to him was u&s;ually no unplea&s;ing garb; but at this cri&s;is of Anne&s;ly's fate&punc; there were feelings he could not &s;uppre&s;s; and he blu&s;hed to him|&s;elf, amid&s;t the prote&s;tations of concern and regard, with which this account of his misfortune (as he termed it) was accompanied. Palliated, as it was, with all the art of &s;ir Thomas, it may be ea&s;ily conceived what effect it mu&s;t have on the mind of a father; a fa|ther at this time labouring under the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;ea&s;e, and con|fined to a &s;ick bed, who&s;e intervals of thought were now to be pointed to the mi&s;ery, the di&s;grace, perhaps the di&s;graceful death, of a darling child. His Harriet, after the fir&s;t &s;hock which the dreadful tidings had given her, &s;at by him, &s;tifling the terrors of her gentle &s;oul, and &s;peaking comfort when her tears would let her.</P>
<P>His grief was aggravated, from the con&s;ideration of being at pre&s;ent unable to attend a &s;on, who&s;e calamities, though of his own procuring, called &s;o loudly for &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>"Unworthy as your brother is, my Harriet, &s;aid he, he is my &s;on and your brother &s;till; and mu&s;t he langui&s;h amid the horrors of a pri&s;on, without a parent or a &s;i&s;ter to le&s;&s;en them? The prayers which I can put up from this &s;ick bed are all the aid I can mini&s;ter to him; but your pre&s;ence might &s;ooth his angui&s;h, and alleviate his &s;ufferings; with regard to this life, perhaps&mdash;Do not weep, my love&mdash;But you might lead him to a reconciliation with that Being who&s;e &s;entence governs eternity! Would it frighten my Harriet to vi&s;it a dungeon?"</P>
<P>"Could I leave my deare&s;t father, &s;aid &s;he, no place could frighten me where my poor Billy is.&mdash;" "Then you &s;hall go, my child, and I &s;hall be the better for thinking that you are with him: tell him, though he has wrong my heart, it has not forgot|ten him. That he &s;hould have forgotten me, is little; let him but now remember, that there is another father, who&s;e pardon is more momentous."</P>
<P>Harriet having therefore entru&s;ted her father to the friend&s;hip of Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, &s;et out, accompanied by a niece of that gen|tlewoman's, who had been on a vi&s;it to her aunt, for the metropo|lis, where &s;he arrived a few days before that which was appointed for the trial of her unhappy brother.</P>
<P>Though it was late in the evening when they reached London, yet Harriet's impatience would not &s;uffer her to &s;leep till &s;he had
<PB N="6" REF="018007_0052_0FA45DCEE8990D18">
&s;een the poor pri&s;oner; and, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of her companion, to whom her aunt had recommended the tendere&s;t concern about her young friend, &s;he called a hackney-coach im|mediately, to convey her to the place in which Anne&s;ly was con|fined; and her fellow traveller, when her di&s;&s;ua&s;ions to going had failed, very obligingly offered to accompany her.</P>
<P>They were conducted, by the turnkey, through a gloomy pa&s;|&s;age, to the wretched apartment which Anne&s;ly occupied: they found him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing at a little table on which he leaned, with his hands covering his face.</P>
<P>When they entered, he did not change his po&s;ture; but on the turnkey's &s;peaking for his &s;i&s;ter was unable to &s;peak, he &s;tarted up, and exhibited a countenance pale and haggard, his eyes blood|&s;hot, and his hair di&s;hevelled. On di&s;covering his &s;i&s;ter, a blu&s;h cro&s;&s;ed his cheek, and the horror of his a&s;pect was lo&s;t in &s;omething milder and more piteous &mdash; "Oh! my Billy!" &s;he cried, and &s;prung forward to embrace him: "This is too much, &s;aid he; leave, and forget a wretch unworthy the name of thy brother." "Would my Billy kill me quite? this frightful place has almo&s;t killed me already! Alas! Billy, my deare&s;t father!" &mdash; "Oh! Harriet, that name, that name! &s;peak not of my father!" "Ah! &s;aid &s;he, if you knew his goodne&s;s; he &s;ent me to comfort and &s;up|port my brother; he &s;ent me from him&s;elf, &s;tretched on a &s;ick bed, where his Harriet &s;hould have tended him."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Oh! cur&s;ed, cur&s;ed!" &mdash; "Nay, do not cur&s;e, my Billy, he &s;ends you none; his prayers, his ble&s;&s;ings ri&s;e for you to heaven; his forgivene&s;s he bade me convey you, and tell you to &s;eek that of the father of all goodne&s;s!"&mdash;</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter's hands were cla&s;ped in his; he lifted both together: "If thou can&s;t hear me, &s;aid he,&mdash;I dare not pray for my&s;elf; but &s;pare a father whom my crimes have made mi&s;erable; let me abide the wrath I have de&s;erved, but weigh not down his age for my offences; puni&s;h it not with the remembrance of me!" He fell on his &s;i&s;ter's neck, and they mingled their tears; nor could the young lady who attended Harriet, or the jailor him&s;elf, forbear accompanying them; this la&s;t, however, recovered him&s;elf rather &s;ooner than the other, and reminded them that it was late, and that he mu&s;t lock up for the night.&mdash;"Good night then, my Harriet," &s;aid Anne&s;ly. "And mu&s;t we &s;eparate? an&s;wered his &s;i&s;ter; could I not &s;it and &s;upport that di&s;tracted head, and clo&s;e tho&s;e haggard eyes?"</P>
<P>"Let me entreat you, returned her brother, to leave me, and com|po&s;e your&s;elf after the fatigues of your journey, and the perturba|tion of your mind. I feel my&s;elf comforted and refre&s;hed by the &s;ight of my Harriet: I will try to &s;leep my&s;elf, which I have not done the&s;e four gloomy nights, unle&s;s, perhaps for a few moments when the torture of my dreams made waking a deliverance. Good night, my deare&s;t Harriet." She could not &s;ay, good night; but &s;he wept it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. His &s;i&s;ter pays him another vi&s;it. A de&s;cription of what pa&s;&s;ed in the pri&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>IT was late before Harriet could think even of going to bed, and later before her mind could be quieted enough to allow her any &s;leep. But nature was at la&s;t worn out; and the fatigue of her journey, together with the conflict of her &s;oul in the vi&s;it &s;he had ju&s;t made, had &s;o exhau&s;ted her, that it was towards noon next day before &s;he awaked. After having chid her&s;elf for her neglect, &s;he hurried away to her much-loved brother, whom &s;he found attended by that baronet, to who&s;e good offices I have had &s;o frequent occa|&s;ion to &s;how him indebted in the cour&s;e of my &s;tory.</P>
<P>At &s;ight of him, her cheek was flu&s;hed with the mingled glow of &s;hame for her brother, and gratitude towards his benefactor. He advanced to &s;alute her; when, with the tears &s;tarting into her eyes, &s;he fell on her knees before him, and poured forth a prayer of ble&s;&s;ings on his head. There could not perhaps be a figure more lovely, or more &s;triking, than that which &s;he then exhibited. The lu&s;tre of her eyes, heightened by tho&s;e tears with which the overflowing of her heart &s;upplied them; the glow of her complex|ion, animated with the &s;uffu&s;ion of tenderne&s;s and gratitude: the&s;e, joined to the ea&s;y negligence of her dark brown locks, that waved in ringlets on her panting bo&s;om, made altogether &s;uch an a&s;&s;em|blage as beauty is a word too weak for.</P>
<P>So forcibly indeed was Sindall &s;truck with it, that &s;ome little time pa&s;t before he thought of lifting her from the ground; he looked his very &s;oul at every glance; but it was a &s;oul unworthy of the object on which he gazed, brutal, unfeeling and inhuman; he con&s;idered her, at that moment, as already within the reach of his machinations, and fea&s;ted the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of his fancy with the anticipation of her undoing.</P>
<P>And here let me pau&s;e a little, to con&s;ider that account of plea|&s;ure which the votaries of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s have frequently &s;tated. I allow for all the delight which Sindall could experience for the pre|&s;ent, or hope to experience in the future. I con&s;ider it ab&s;tracted from its con&s;equences, and I will venture to affirm, that there is a truer, a more exqui&s;ite voluptuary than he.&mdash;</P>
<P>Had virtue been now looking on the figure of beauty, and of in|nocence, I have attempted to draw. &mdash;I &s;ee the purpo&s;e of benevo|lence beaming in his eye! &mdash; Its throb is &s;welling in his heart! &mdash; He cla&s;ps her to his bo&s;om; &mdash; he ki&s;&s;es the falling drops from her cheek;&mdash;he weeps with her; &mdash;and the luxury of his tears;&mdash;baf|fles de&s;cription.</P>
<P>But whatever were &s;ir Thomas's &s;en&s;ations at the &s;ight of Har|riet, they were interrupted by the jailor, who now entered the
<PB N="8" REF="018007_0054_0FA45DD31DF3CD08">
room, and informed him that a gentleman without was earne&s;t to &s;peak with him. "Who can it be?" &s;aid &s;ir Thomas, &s;omewhat peevi&s;hly. &mdash;'If I am not mi&s;taken, replied the jailor, it is a gen|tleman of the name of Camplin, a lawyer, whom I have &s;een here with &s;ome of the pri&s;oners before.'&mdash;</P>
<P>"This is he of whom I talked to you, my dear Anne&s;ly, &s;aid the baronet; let me introduce him to you." &mdash; 'I have taken my re&s;olution, returned Anne&s;ly, and &s;hall have no need of lawyers for my defence'&mdash;"It mu&s;t not be," rejoined the other; and going out of the room, he pre&s;ently returned with Mr. Camplin. All this while Harriet's looks betrayed the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ymptoms of terror and perplexity; and when the &s;tranger appeared, &s;he drew nearer and nearer to her brother, with an involuntary &s;ort of motion, till &s;he had twined his arm into hers, and placed her&s;elf between him and Camplin. This la&s;t ob&s;erved her fears; for indeed &s;he bent her eyes mo&s;t fixedly upon him, and making her a bow. "Be not afraid, mi&s;s, &s;aid he, here are none but friends; I learn, &s;ir, that your day is now very near, and that it is time to be thinking of the bu&s;ine&s;s of it." "Good heavens! cried Harriet, what day?" "Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, madam, continued Camplin, being the fir&s;t trip, I hope he may fall &s;oft for this time; I believe no body doubts my abilities: I have &s;aved many a brave man from the gallows, who&s;e ca&s;e was more de&s;pe|rate than I take this young gentleman's to be."&mdash;</P>
<P>The colour, which had been varying on her cheek during this &s;peech, now left it for a dead pale; and turning her languid eyes upon her brother, &s;he fell motionle&s;s into his arms. He &s;upport|ed her to a chair that &s;tood near him, and darting an indignant look at the lawyer, begged of the jailor to procure her &s;ome imme|diate a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Sindall, who was kneeling on the other &s;ide of her, ordered Camplin, who was advancing to make offer of his &s;ervices too, to be gone, and &s;end them the fir&s;t &s;urgeon he could find. A &s;urgeon indeed had been already procured, who officiated in the pri&s;on, for the be&s;t of all rea&s;ons, becau&s;e he was not at liberty to leave it. The jailor now made his appearance, with a bottle of wine in one hand, and &s;ome water in the other; followed by a tall, meagre, ragged figure, who &s;triding up to Harriet, applied a &s;mall vial of volatile &s;alt to her no&s;e, and cha&s;ing her temples, &s;oon brought her to &s;en&s;e and life again.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly pre&s;&s;ing her to his bo&s;om, begged her to recollect her|&s;elf and forget her fears. "Pardon this weakne&s;s, my dear Billy, &s;aid &s;he, I will try to overcome it; is that horrid man gone? who is this gentleman?" "I have the honour to be a doctor of phy|&s;ic, madam, &s;aid he, clapping at the &s;ame time his grea&s;y fingers to her pul&s;e. Here is a fulne&s;s that calls for venefection."</P>
<P>So without lo&s;s of time he pulled out a ca&s;e of lancets covered with ru&s;t, and &s;potted with the blood of former patients. Oh! for heaven's &s;ake, no bleeding, cried Harriet, indeed there is no oc|ca&s;ion for it." "How, no occa&s;ion! exclaimed the other; I have
<PB N="9" REF="018007_0055_0FA45DD485E892C0">
heard indeed &s;ome ignorants condemn phlebotomy in &s;uch ca&s;es; but it is my practice, and I am very well able to defend it.&mdash;It will be allowed that in plethoric habits"&mdash;'Spare your demon&s;t|ration, interrupted Anne&s;ly, and think of your patient.' "You &s;hall not blood me, &s;aid &s;he; you &s;hall not indeed, &s;ir!" "Nay, madam, &s;aid he, as you plea&s;e; you are to know that the opera|tion it&s;elf is no part of my profe&s;&s;ion; it is only "propter nece&s;&s;itatem," for want of chirurgical practitioners, that I &s;ome|times conde&s;cend to it in this place." Sir Thomas gave him a hint to leave them, and at the &s;ame time &s;lipped a guinea into his hand. He immediately retired, looking at the unu&s;ual appear|ance of the gold with &s;o much tran&s;port, that he might po&s;&s;ibly have as much occa&s;ion for bleeding at that moment, as the patient for whom he had ju&s;t pre&s;cribed it.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his friend, u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible argument to comfort and &s;upport his &s;i&s;ter. His concern for her had indeed bani&s;hed for a while the con&s;ideration of his own &s;tate; and when he came to think of that &s;olemn day, on which the trial for his life was appointed, his concern was more intere&s;ted for its effect on his Harriet, than for that it &s;hould have on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>After they had pa&s;&s;ed great part of the day together, &s;ir Thomas ob&s;erved, that Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly's pre&s;ent lodgings (in the hou&s;e of her fellow-traveller's father) were &s;o di&s;tant, as to occa&s;ion much in|convenience to her in her vi&s;its to her brother; and very kindly made offer of endeavouring to procure her others but a few &s;treets off, under the roof of a gentlewoman, he &s;aid, an officer's widow of his acquaintance, who, if &s;he had any apartment unoccupied at the time, he knew would be as attentive to Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly as if &s;he were a daughter of her own.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al was readily accepted, and &s;ir Thomas having gone upon the enquiry, returned in the evening with an account of his having &s;ucceeded in procuring the lodgings; that he had taken the liberty to call and fetch Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly's baggage from tho&s;e &s;he had formerly occupied, and that every thing was ready at Mrs. Eldridge's (that was the widow's name) for her reception. After &s;upper he conducted her thither accordingly. As he was going out, Anne&s;ly whi&s;pered him to return for a few minutes after he had &s;et down his &s;i&s;ter, as he had &s;omething particular to communicate to him. When he came back, "You have heard, I fancy, &s;ir Thomas, &s;aid he, that the next day but one is the day of my trial. As to my&s;elf, I wait it with re&s;ignation, and &s;hall not give any trouble to my country by a fal&s;e defence; but I tremble for my &s;i&s;ter's knowing it. Could we not contrive &s;ome method of keeping her in ignorance of its appointment till it be over, and then prepare her for the event without &s;ubjecting her to the tortures of anxiety and &s;u&s;pence?" Sindall agreed in the propriety of the latter part of his &s;cheme, and they re&s;olved to keep his &s;i&s;ter that day at home, on pretence of a meeting in the pri&s;on between the lawyers
<PB N="10" REF="018007_0056_0FA45DD4E85499A8">
of Anne&s;ly, and tho&s;e of his pro&s;ecutor. But he warmly in&s;i&s;ted, that Anne&s;ly &s;hould accept the &s;ervices of Camplin towards con|ducting the cau&s;e on his part. "Endeavour not to per&s;uade me, my friend, &s;aid Anne&s;ly; for I now re&s;t &s;atisfied with my determination. I thank heaven which has enabled me to rely on its goodne&s;s, and meet my fate with the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my&s;elf. I will not di&s;dain the mercy which my country may think I merit; but I will not entangle my&s;elf in chicane and in&s;incerity to avoid her ju&s;tice."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. The fate of Anne&s;ly determined.&mdash;Sindall's friend|&s;hip, and the gratitude of Harriet.</HEAD>
<P>NOthing remarkable happened till that day when the fate of Anne&s;ly was to be determined by the laws of his country. The project formed by Sindall and him&s;elf, for keeping his &s;i&s;ter ignorant of its importance, &s;ucceeded to their wi&s;h; &s;he &s;pent it at home, comforting her&s;elf with the hope, that the meeting &s;he under&s;tood to be held on it, might turn out advantageou&s;ly for her brother, and &s;ooth'd by the kindne&s;s of her landlady, who had indeed fully an&s;wered &s;ir Thomas's expectations in the attention &s;he had &s;hown her.</P>
<P>Meanwhile her unfortunate brother was brought to the bar, in|dicted for the robbery committed on the game&s;ter. When he was a&s;ked, in the cu&s;tomary manner to plead, he &s;tood up, and addre&s;|&s;ing him&s;elf to the judge.</P>
<P>"I am now, my lord, &s;aid he, in a &s;ituation of all others the mo&s;t &s;olemn. I &s;tand in the pre&s;ence of God and my country, and I am called to confe&s;s or deny that crime for which I have incurred the judgment of both. If I have offended, my lord, I am not yet an obdurate offender; I fly not to the &s;ubterfuge of villany, though I have fallen from the dignity of innocence; and I will not &s;creen a life which my crimes have di&s;graced, by a coward lie to prevent their detection. I plead guilty, my lord, and await the judgment of that law, which though I have violated, I have not forgotten to rever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">."</P>
<P>When he ended, a confu&s;ed murmur ran through the court, and for &s;ome time &s;topt the judge in his reply. Silence obtained, that upright magi&s;trate, worthy the tribunal of England, &s;poke to this effect:</P>
<P>"I am &s;incerely &s;orry, young gentleman, to &s;ee one of your figure at this bar, charged with a crime for which the public &s;afe|ty has been obliged to award an exemplary puni&s;hment. Much as I admire the heroi&s;m of your confe&s;&s;ion, I will not &s;uffer ad|vantage to betaken of it to your prejudice; reflect on the con&s;e|quences

of a plea of guilt, which takes from you all opportunity of a legal defence, and &s;peak again, as your own di&s;cretion, or your friends, may be&s;t advi&s;e you." "I humbly thank your lord&s;hip, &s;aid Anne&s;ly, for the candour and indulgence which you &s;how me; but I have &s;poken the truth, and will not allow my&s;elf to think of retracting it." "I am here, returned his lord&s;hip, as the di&s;|pen&s;er of ju&s;tice, and I have nothing but ju&s;tice to give; the pro|vince of mercy is in other hands; it upon enquiry, the ca&s;e is cir|cum&s;tanced as I wi&s;h it to be, my recommendation &s;hall not be wanting to enforce an application there." Anne&s;ly was then con|victed of the robbery, and the &s;entence of the law pa&s;&s;ed upon him.</P>
<P>But the judge, before whom he was tried, was not unmindful of his promi&s;e; and having &s;atisfied him&s;elf, that, though guilty in this in&s;tance, he was not habitually flagitious, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;o warmly the applications which through the intere&s;t of Sindall (for Sindall was in this &s;incere) were made in his behalf, that a pardon was obtained for him, on the condition of his &s;uffering tran&s;porta|tion for the term of fourteen years.</P>
<P>This alleviation of his puni&s;hment was procured, before his &s;i&s;|ter was &s;uffered to know that his trial had ever come on, or what had been its event. When his fate was by this means determined, Sindall undertook to in&s;truct the lady in who&s;e hou&s;e he had placed her, that Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly &s;hould be acquainted with the circum&s;tances of it in &s;uch a manner, as might lea&s;t di&s;compo&s;e that delicacy and tenderne&s;s of which her mind was &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P>The event an&s;wered his expectation; that good woman &s;eemed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as much addre&s;s as humanity; and Harriet, by the intervention of both, was led to the knowlege of her brother's &s;itu|ation with &s;o much prudence, that &s;he bore it at fir&s;t with re&s;ig|nation, and afterwards looked upon it with thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>After that acknowlegement to providence which &s;he had been early in&s;tructed never to forget, there was an inferior agent in this affair to whom her warme&s;t gratitude was devoted. Be&s;ides that her&s;elf had the highe&s;t opinion of Sindall's good offices, her obliging landlady had taken every opportunity, &s;ince their ac|quaintance began, to trumpet forth his prai&s;es in the mo&s;t extrava|gant &s;train; and, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, her encomiums we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> loud in proportion as Harriet's happine&s;s was concerned in the event.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas therefore began to be con&s;idered by the young lady as the worthie&s;t of friends; his own language bore the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip; of friend&s;hip and no more; but the widow would often in&s;inuate that he felt more than he expre&s;&s;ed; and when Harriet's &s;pirits could bear a little railery, her landlady did not want for jokes on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions of another have a greater effect than is often imagined; they are heard with an ea&s;e which does not alarm, and the mind habituates it&s;elf to take up &s;uch a credit on their

truth as it would be &s;orry to lo&s;e, though it is not at the trouble of examining. Harriet did not &s;eriou&s;ly think of Sindall as of one that was her lover; but &s;he began to make &s;uch arrangements as not to be &s;urprized if he &s;hould.</P>
<P>One morning when &s;ir Thomas had called, to conduct her on a vi&s;it to her brother, Mrs. Eldridge rallied him at breakfa&s;t on his being &s;till a batchelor. "What is your opinion, Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, &s;aid &s;he; is it not a &s;hame for one of &s;ir Thomas's fortune not to make &s;ome worthy woman happy in the participation of it?" Sindall &s;ubmitted to be judged by &s;o fair an arbitre&s;s; he &s;aid "the manners of the court-ladies, who&s;e example had &s;tretched unhappily too far, were &s;uch, as made it a &s;ort of venture to be married;" he then pau&s;ed for a moment, &s;igh'd, and, fixing his eyes upon Harriet, drew &s;uch a picture of the woman whom he would chu&s;e for a wi&s;e, that &s;he mu&s;t have had &s;ome &s;illier quali|ties than mere mode&s;ty about her, not to have made &s;ome gue&s;s at his meaning.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, though &s;he was as little wanting in delicacy as mo&s;t women, &s;he began to feel a certain intere&s;t in the good opinion of Sindall, and to draw &s;ome conclu&s;ions from his deportment, which, for the &s;ake of my fair readers, I would have them remember, are better to be &s;lowly under&s;tood than ha&s;tily indulged.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. An accident, which may po&s;&s;ibly be imagined &s;ome|what more than accidental.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the thoughts of Anne&s;ly's future &s;ituation could not but be di&s;tre&s;sful to his &s;i&s;ter and him, yet the deliver|ance from greater evils which they had experienced, &s;erved to en|lighten the pro&s;pect of tho&s;e they feared. His father, who&s;e con|&s;olation always attended the calamity he could neither prevent nor cure, exhorted his &s;on (in an an&s;wer to the account his &s;i&s;ter and he had tran&s;mitted him of the events contained in the preceding chapter) to have a proper &s;en&s;e of the mercy of his God and his country, and to bear what was a mitigation of his puni&s;hment, with a fortitude and re&s;ignation becoming the &s;ubject of both.</P>
<P>The &s;ame letter informed his children, that though he was not well enough recovered to be able to travel, yet he was gaining ground on his di&s;temper, and hoped, as the &s;ea&s;on advanced, to get the better of it altogether. He &s;ent that ble&s;&s;ing to his &s;on which he was prevented from be&s;towing per&s;onally, with a credit for any &s;um which he might have occa&s;ion for again&s;t his approach|ing departure.</P>
<P>His children received additional comfort from the good accounts of their father, which this letter contained; and even in Anne&s;ly's
<PB N="13" REF="018007_0059_0FA45DD74A9194E8">
pri&s;on, there were &s;ome intervals in which they forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the fears of parting, and indulged them&s;elves in temporary happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was during one of the&s;e, that Sindall ob&s;erved to Harriet, how little &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the curio&s;ity her &s;ex was charged with, who had never once thought of &s;eeing any thing in London that &s;trangers were mo&s;t &s;olicitous to &s;ee; and propo&s;ed that very night to con|duct her to the playhou&s;e, where the royal family were to be pre|&s;ent, at the repre&s;entation of a new comedy.</P>
<P>Harriet turned a melancholy look towards her brother, and made an&s;wer, that &s;he could not think of any amu&s;ement that &s;hould &s;ubject him to hours of &s;olitude in a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Upon this, Anne&s;ly was earne&s;t in pre&s;&s;ing her to accept &s;ir Thomas's invitation; he &s;aid &s;he knew how often he cho&s;e to be alone, at times when he could mo&s;t command &s;ociety; and that he &s;hould find an additional plea&s;ure in theirs, when they return|ed to him, fraught with the intelligence of the play.</P>
<P>"But there is &s;omething unbecoming in it, &s;aid Harriet, in the eyes of others."</P>
<P>"That objection, replied Sindall, will be ea&s;ily removed; we &s;hall go accompanied by Mrs. Eldridge to the gallery, where even tho&s;e who have many acquaintances in town, are dre&s;&s;ed &s;o much in the incognito-way, as never to be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly repeated his entreaties, Mrs. Eldridge &s;econded, Sindall enforced them; and all three urged &s;o many arguments, that Harriet was at la&s;t overcome, and to the play they accordingly went.</P>
<P>Though this was the fir&s;t entertainment of the &s;ort, at which Har|riet had ever been pre&s;ent, yet the thoughts of her ab&s;ent brother, in who&s;e company all her former amu&s;ements had been enjoyed, &s;o much damped the plea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould have felt from this, that as &s;oon as the play was over, &s;he begged of her conductor to return, much again&s;t the de&s;ire of Mrs. Eldridge, who entreated them to indulge her by &s;taying the farce. But Harriet &s;eemed &s;o unea&s;y at the thoughts of a longer ab&s;ence from her brother, that the other's &s;olicitations were at la&s;t overruled; and making &s;hift to get through the croud, they left the hou&s;e, and &s;et out in a Hackney-coach on their return.</P>
<P>They had got the length of two or three &s;treets on their way&punc; when the coachman, who indeed had the appearance of being exceedingly drunk, drove them again&s;t a po&s;t, by which accident one of the wheels was broken to pieces, and the carriage it&s;elf immediately overturned, Sindall had, luckily, put down the gla&s;s on that &s;ide but a moment before, to look at &s;omething, &s;o that they e&s;caped any mi&s;chief which might have en&s;ued from the breaking of it; and, except the ladies being extremely frightened, no bad con&s;equences followed. This di&s;a&s;ter happened ju&s;t at the door of a tavern; the mi&s;tre&s;s of which &s;eeing the di&s;compo&s;ure of the ladies, very politely begged them to &s;tep into her own room till
<PB N="14" REF="018007_0060_0FA45DDAC52ED3F8">
they could re-adju&s;t them&s;elves, and procure another coach from a neighbouring &s;tand, for which &s;he promi&s;ed immediately to di&s;|patch one of her &s;ervants.</P>
<P>All this while &s;ir Thomas was venting his wrath again&s;t the coachman, continuing to cane him mo&s;t unmercifully, till &s;topt by the interce&s;&s;ion of Harriet and Mrs. Eldridge, and prevailed upon to accompany them into the hou&s;e at the obliging reque&s;t of its mi&s;tre&s;s. He a&s;ked pardon for giving way to his pa&s;&s;ion, which apprehen&s;ion for their &s;afety, he &s;aid, had occa&s;ioned, and taking Harriet's hand with a look of the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, enquired if &s;he felt no hurt from the fall; upon her an&s;wering, that except the fright, &s;he was perfectly well; "then all is well," &s;aid he, pre&s;&s;ing her hand to his bo&s;om, which ro&s;e to meet it with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>He then called for a bottle of Madeira, of which his companions drank each a gla&s;s; but upon his pre&s;enting another, Mrs. Eld|ridge declared &s;he never ta&s;ted anything between meals, and Har|riet &s;aid that her head was already affected by the gla&s;s &s;he had taken: this however he attributed to the effects of the overturn, for which another bumper was an infallible remedy; and, on Mrs. Eldridge's &s;etting the example, though with the utmo&s;t reluctance, Harriet was prevailed upon to follow it.</P>
<P>She was &s;eated on a &s;ettee at the upper end of the room, Sindall &s;at on a chair by her, and Mrs. Eldridge, from choice, was walk|ing about the room; it &s;omehow happened that, in a few minutes, the la&s;t mentioned lady left her companions by them&s;elves</P>
<P>Sindall, who&s;e eyes had not been idle before, ca&s;t them now to the ground with a look of the mo&s;t feeling di&s;compo&s;ure; and gently lifting them again, "I know not, &s;aid he, mo&s;t lovely of women, whether I &s;hould venture to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;ations of my heart at this moment; that re&s;pect which ever attends a love &s;o &s;incere as mine, has hitherto kept me &s;ilent; but the late accident, in which all that I hold dear was endangered, has opened every &s;luice of tenderne&s;s in my &s;oul, and I were more or le&s;s than man, did I re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;e of declaring it."</P>
<P>"This is no place, &s;ir,"&mdash;&s;aid Harriet, trembling and covered with blu&s;hes.&mdash;"Every place, cried Sindall, is &s;acred to love, where my Harriet is." At the &s;ame time he threw him&s;elf on his knees before her, and imprinted a thou&s;and burning ki&s;&s;es on her hand.</P>
<P>"Let go my hand, &s;ir Thomas," &s;he cried, her voice faltering and her cheek over&s;pread with a &s;till higher glow: "Never, thou cruel one, &s;aid he, (rai&s;ing him&s;elf gently till he had gained a place on the &s;ettee by her &s;ide) never, till you li&s;ten to the dictates of a pa&s;&s;ion too violent to be longer re&s;i&s;ted."&mdash;</P>
<P>At that in&s;tant &s;ome bu&s;tle was heard at the door, and pre&s;ently after a voice in a country-accent, vociferating "It is my neigh|bour's own daughter, and I mu&s;t &s;ee her immediately." &mdash; The door bur&s;t open, and di&s;covered Jack Ryland, Mrs. Eldridge fol|lowing him, with a countenance not the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of good humour.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="018007_0061_0FA45DDC71FC0D10">"Ryland! exclaimed the baronet, what is the meaning of this?" advancing towards him with an air of fiercene&s;s and indig|nation, which the other returned with a hearty &s;hake by the hand, &s;aying he was rejoiced to find Mi&s;s Harriet in &s;o good company. &mdash;"Dear Mr. Ryland, &s;aid &s;he, a little confu&s;edly, I am happy to &s;ee you; but it is odd&mdash;I cannot conceive&mdash;tell us, as &s;ir Thomas was ju&s;t now a&s;king, how you came to find us out here."</P>
<P>"Why, you mu&s;t under&s;tand, Mi&s;s, returned Jack, that I have got a little bit of a legacy left me by a relation here in London; as I was coming up on that bu&s;ine&s;s, I thought I could do no le&s;s than a&s;k your worthy father's commands for you and Mr. William. So we &s;ettled matters, that, as our times, I believe, will agree well enough, I &s;hould have the plea&s;ure, if you are not otherwi&s;e engaged, of conducting you home again. I came to town only this day, and after having eat a mutton-chop at the inn where I lighted, and got my&s;elf into a little decent trim, I &s;et out from a place they call Piccadilly, I think, a&s;king every body I met which was the &s;horte&s;t way to Newgate, where I under&s;tood your brother was to be found.</P>
<P>But I was like to make a marvellous long journey on't; for be&s;ides that it is a huge long way, as I was told, I hardly met with one per&s;on that would give a mannerly an&s;wer to my que&s;tions; to be &s;ure they are the mo&s;t humour&s;ome people, here in London, that ever I &s;aw in my life, when I a&s;ked the road to Newgate, one told me, I was not likely to be long in finding it; another bade me &s;teal a Silver Tankard and it would &s;how me; and a deal of &s;uch out-of-the-way jokes.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, while I was looking round for &s;ome civil-like body to enquire of, who &s;hould I &s;ee whip pa&s;t me in a coach but your&s;elf with that lady, as I take it; upon which I hollowed out to the coachman to &s;top, but he did not hear me, as I &s;uppo&s;e, and drove on as hard as ever; I followed him clo&s;e at the heels for &s;ome time, till the &s;treet he turned into being much darker than where I &s;aw you fir&s;t, by rea&s;on there were none of your torches blazing there, I fell headlong into a rut in the middle of it, and lo&s;t &s;ight of the carriage before I could recover my&s;elf: however, I ran down a right hand road, which I gue&s;&s;ed you had taken, a&s;king any body I thought would give me an an&s;wer, if they had &s;een a coach with a hand&s;ome young woman in't, drawn by a pair of dark bays; but I was only laught at for my pains, till I fell in by chance with a &s;imple country-man like my&s;elf, who informed me, that he had &s;een &s;uch a one overturned ju&s;t before this-here large hou&s;e; and the door being open, I &s;tept in without more ado, till I happened to hear this lady whi&s;pering &s;omething to another about &s;ir Tho|mas Sindall, when I gue&s;&s;ed that you might be with him, as ac|quaintances will find one another out, you know; and &s;o here I am, at your &s;ervice and &s;ir Thomas's."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="018007_0062_0FA45DDE12C09920">This hi&s;tory afforded as little entertainment to its hearers as it may have done to the greate&s;t part of my readers; but it gave &s;ir Thomas and Harriet time enough to recover from that confu&s;i|on, into which the appearance of Ryland had thrown both of them; though with this difference, that Harriet's was free from the guilt of Sindall's and did not even proceed from the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any thing criminal in the intentions of that gentleman.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas pretended great &s;atisfaction in having met with his acquaintance Mr. Ryland, and, having obtained another hackney-coach, they drove together to Newgate, where Jack received a much &s;incerer welcome from Anne&s;ly, and they pa&s;&s;ed the even|ing with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Not but that there moved &s;omething unu&s;ual in the bo&s;om of Harriet, from the declaration of her lover, and in his, from the attempt which Providence had interpo&s;ed to di&s;appoint; he con&s;ol|ed him&s;elf, however, with the reflexion, that he had not gone &s;uch a length as to alarm her &s;implicity, and took from the mortifica|tion of the pa&s;t, by the hope of more &s;ucce&s;sful villainy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. An account of Anne&s;ly's departure.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> was not long before the time arrived in which Anne&s;ly was to bid adieu to his native country for the term which the mercy of his &s;overeign had allotted for his puni&s;hment. He behaved, at this junc|ture, with a determined &s;ort of coolne&s;s, not ea&s;ily expected from one of his warmth of feelings, at a time of life when the&s;e are in their fulle&s;t vigour. His &s;i&s;ter, whole gentle heart began to droop under the thoughts of their &s;eperation, he employed every argument to comfort. <HI>He</HI> bade her remember that it had been determined he &s;hould be ab&s;ent for &s;ome years, before this nece&s;&s;ity of his ab&s;ence had ari&s;en. "Sup|po&s;e me on my travels, &s;aid he, my Harriet but for a longer term, and the &s;um of his calamity is exhau&s;ted; if there are hard&s;hips await|ing me, think how I &s;hould otherwi&s;e expiate my follies and my crimes: the puni&s;hments of heaven, our father has often told us, are mercies to its children; mine, I hope, will have a double effect; to wipe away my former offences, and prevent my offending for the future."</P>
<P>He was actuated by the &s;ame &s;teadine&s;s of &s;pirit, in the di&s;po&s;al of what money his father's credit enabled him to command. He called in an exact account of his debts, tho&s;e to Sindall not excepted, and di&s;|charged them in full, much again&s;t the inclination of &s;ir Thomas, who in&s;i&s;ted, as much as in decency he could, on cancelling every obligation of that &s;ort to him&s;elf. But Anne&s;ly was po&s;itive in his re&s;olution; and after having cleared the&s;e incumbrances, he embarked with only a few &s;hillings in his pocket, &s;aying, that he would never pinch his fa|ther's age, to mitigate the puni&s;hment which his &s;on had more than de&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="018007_0063_0FA45DDEAD0D2C30">There was another account to &s;ettle, which he found a more difficult ta&s;k. The parting with his &s;i&s;ter, he knew not how to accompli&s;h, without &s;uch a pang as her tender frame could very ill &s;upport. At length he re&s;olved to take at lea&s;t from its &s;olemnity, if he could not alleviate its angui&s;h. Having &s;at, therefore, with Harriet till pa&s;t midnight, on the eve of his departure, which he employed in renewing his arguments of con&s;olation, and earne&s;tly recommending to her to keep up tho&s;e &s;pirits which &s;hould &s;upport her father and her&s;elf, he pre|tended a de&s;ire to &s;leep, appointed an hour for breakfa&s;ting with her in the morning; and &s;o &s;oon as he could prevail on her to leave him, he went on board the boat, which waited to carry him, and &s;ome unfortunate companions of his voyage to the &s;hip de&s;tined to tran&s;port them.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas accompanied him a little way down the river, till, at the earne&s;t de&s;ire of his friend, he was carried a&s;hore in a &s;culler, which they happened to meet on their way When they parted, Anne&s;ly wrung his hand, and dropping a tear on it, which hitherto he had never allowed him&s;elf to &s;hed, "To my faithful Sindall, &s;aid he, I leave a tru&s;t more precious to this bo&s;om than every other earthly good.</P>
<P>Be the friend of my father, as you have been that of his unde&s;erving &s;on, and protect my Harriet's youth, who has lo&s;t that protection a brother &s;hould have afforded her. If the prayers of a wretched exile in a foreign land can be heard of heaven, the name of his friend &s;hall ri&s;e with tho&s;e of a parent and a &s;i&s;ter in his hourly benedictions; and if at any time you &s;hall be&s;tow a thought upon him, remember the only comfort of which adver&s;ity has not deprived him, the confidence of his Sindall's kindne&s;s to tho&s;e whom he has left weeping behind him."</P>
<P>Such was the charge which Anne&s;ly gave and Sindall received; he received it with a tear; a tear, which the better part of his nature had yet re&s;erved from the ruins of principle, of ju&s;tice, of huma|nity. It fell involuntarily at the time, and he thought of it after|wards with a blu&s;h&mdash;Such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;y&s;tem of &s;elf applau&s;e which the refinements of vice had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him, and &s;uch is the honour &s;he has reared for the wor&s;hip of her votaries!</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly kept his eyes fixed on the lights of London, till the encrea&s;ing di&s;tance deprived them of their object. Nor did his imagination fail him in the picture, after that help was taken from her. The form of the weeping Harriet, lovely in her grief, &s;till &s;wam before his &s;ight; on the back ground &s;tood a venerable figure, turning his eyes to heaven, while a tear that &s;welled in each dropped for the &s;acrifice of his &s;orrow, and a bending angel accepted it as incen&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus, by a &s;eries of di&s;&s;ipation, &s;o ea&s;y in its progre&s;s, that, it if my tale were fiction, it would be thought too &s;imple, was this un|fortunate young man lo&s;s to him&s;elf, his friends, and his country. Take but a few incidents away, and it is the hi&s;tory of thou&s;ands. Let not tho&s;e, who have e&s;caped the puni&s;hment of Anne&s;ly, look with indiffer|ence on the participation of his guilt, nor &s;uffer the pre&s;ent undi&s;turbed enjoyment of their criminal plea&s;ures, so blot from their minds the idea of future retribution.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. Harriet is informed of her Brother's departure. She leaves London on her return home.</HEAD>
<P>SINDALL took upon him&s;elf the charge of communicating the intelligence of Anne&s;ly's departure to his &s;i&s;ter. She received it with an entrancement of &s;orrow, which deprived her of its ex|pre&s;&s;ion; and when at la&s;t her tears found their way to utter it, "Is he gone! &s;aid &s;he, and &s;hall I never &s;ee him more? cruel Billy! Oh! &s;ir Thomas, I had a thou&s;and things to &s;ay! and has he left me without a &s;ingle adieu?"&mdash;'It was in kindne&s;s to you, Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, an&s;wered the baronet, that he did &s;o.'&mdash;"I believe you, &s;aid &s;he, I know it was; and yet, methinks, he &s;hould have bid me farewell&mdash;I could have &s;tood it, indeed I could&mdash;I am not &s;o weak as you think me; yet Heaven knows I have need of &s;trength"&mdash;and &s;he bur&s;t into tears again.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas did not want for expre&s;&s;ions of comfort or of kind|ne&s;s, nor did he fail, amid&s;t the a&s;&s;urances of his friend&s;hip, to &s;ugge&s;t tho&s;e tenderer &s;en&s;ations which his bo&s;om felt on account of Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly. She gave him a warmth of gratitude in return, which, though vice may &s;ometimes take advantage of it, virtue can never blame.</P>
<P>His prote&s;tations were interrupted by the arrival of Ryland, who had accidentally heard of Anne&s;ly's embarkment. Jack had but few words to communicate his feelings by; but his eyes helped them out with an hone&s;t tear. "Your brother, I hear, is gone, Mi&s;s Harriet, &s;aid he; well, Heaven ble&s;s him wherever he goes!"</P>
<P>Harriet begg'd to know when it would &s;uit his convenience to leave London, &s;aying, that every day &s;he &s;tayed there now, would reproach her ab&s;ence from her father. Jack made an&s;wer, that he could be ready to attend her at an hour's warning; for that his bu&s;ine&s;s in London was fini&s;hed, and as for plea&s;ure he could find none in it. It was agreed therefore, contrary to the zealous ad|vice of &s;ir Thomas and Mrs. Eldridge, that Harriet &s;hould &s;et off, accompanied by Mr. Ryland, the very next morning.</P>
<P>Their re&s;olution was accompli&s;hed, and they &s;et out by the break of day. Sindall accompanied them on hor&s;eback &s;everal &s;tages, and they dined together about forty miles from London. Here having &s;ettled their rout according to a plan of &s;ir Thomas's who &s;eemed to be perfectly ver&s;ant in the geography of the country, through which they were to pa&s;s, he was prevailed on, by the earne&s;t entreaty of Harriet, to return to London, and leave her to perform the re&s;t of the journey under the protection of Mr. Ryland. On their leaving the inn at which they dined, there occurred an incident, of which, though the reader may have ob&s;erved me not
<PB N="19" REF="018007_0065_0FA45DE03254FE98">
apt to dwell on trifling circum&s;tances, I cannot help taking notice. While they were at dinner, they were frequently di&s;turbed by the boi&s;terous mirth of a company in the room immediately adjoining. This, one of the waiters informed them, proceeded from a gentle|man, who, he believed, was travelling from London down into the country, and, having no companion, had a&s;&s;ociated with the land|lord over a bottle of claret, which according to the waiter's ac|count, his honour had made &s;o free with as to be in a merrier, or as that word may generally be tran&s;lated&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more noi&s;e-making mood than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>As Sindall was handing Harriet into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, they ob|&s;erved a gentleman, whom they concluded to be the &s;ame who&s;e voice they had &s;o often heard at dinner, &s;tanding in the pa&s;&s;age that led to the door. When the lady pa&s;&s;ed him, he trod, either accidentally or on purpo&s;e, on the &s;kirt of her gown behind; and as &s;he turned about to get rid of the &s;top, having now got &s;ight of her face, be exclaimed, with an oath, that &s;he was an angel; and, &s;eizing the hand with which &s;he was di&s;engaging her gown, pre&s;|&s;ed it to his lips in &s;o rude a manner, that even his drunkenne&s;s could not excu&s;e it; at lea&s;t it could not to Sindall; who &s;tepping between him and Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, laid hold of his collar, and &s;hak|ing him violently, demanded how he dared to affront the lady; and in&s;i&s;ted on his immediately a&s;king her pardon. "Dammee," &s;aid he, hiccupping, "not on compul&s;ion, dammee, for you nor any man, dammee."</P>
<P>The landlord and Mr: Ryland now interpo&s;ed, and with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of Harriet, pacified &s;ir Thomas, from the con&s;ideration of the gentleman's being in a temporary &s;tate of in&s;anity; Sindall ac|cordingly let go his hold, and went on with Harriet to the chai&s;e, while the other, re-adju&s;ting his neck cloth, &s;wore that he would have another peep at the girl notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>When Harriet was &s;eated in the chai&s;e, Sindall took notice of the flutter into which this accident had thrown her; &s;he confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had been a good deal alarmed, le&s;t there &s;hould have been a quarrel on her account, and begged &s;ir Thomas, if he had any regard for her ea&s;e of mind, to think no more of any vengeance again&s;t the other gentleman.</P>
<P>"Fear not, my adorable Harriet, whi&s;pered &s;ir Thomas; if I thought there were one kind remembrance of Sindall in that hea|venly bo&s;om"&mdash;the chai&s;e drove on&mdash;&s;he blu&s;hed a reply to this unfini&s;hed &s;peech, and bowed, &s;miling, to its author.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. Harriet proceeds on her journey with Ryland.&mdash; A very daring attack is made upon them. The con&s;equences.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING farther happened worthy of recording, till towards the clo&s;e of that journey which &s;ir Thomas's direc|tion had marked out for their fir&s;t day's progre&s;s. Ryland had before ob&s;erved, that &s;ir Thomas's &s;hort roads had turned out very &s;orry ones; and when it began to be dark, Harriet's fears made her take notice, that they had got upon a large common, where, for a great way round, there was not a hou&s;e to be &s;een. Nor was &s;he at all relieved by the information of the po&s;t-boy, who, upon being interrogated by Ryland as to the &s;afety of the road, an&s;wer|ed, "To be &s;ure, ma&s;ter, I've known &s;ome highwaymen frequent this common, and there &s;tands a gibbet hard by, where two of them have hung the&s;e three years."</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely uttered this &s;peech, when the noi&s;e of hor&s;emen was heard behind them, at which Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly's heart began to palpitate, nor was her companion's free from unu&s;ual agitation. He a&s;ked the po&s;t-boy, in a low voice, if he knew the riders who were coming up behind; the boy an&s;wered in the negative, but that he needed not be afraid, as he ob&s;erved a carriage along with them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the hor&s;emen now pa&s;&s;ed the chai&s;e in which Ryland and Harriet were, and at the di&s;tance of a few yards they cro&s;&s;ed the road, and made a halt on the other &s;ide of it. Harriet's fears were now too much alarmed to be quieted by the late a&s;&s;urance of the po&s;t-boy: &s;he was not, indeed, long &s;uffered to remain in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence; one of tho&s;e objects of her terror called to the driver to &s;top, which the lad had no &s;ooner complied with, than he rode up to the &s;ide of the carriage where the lady was &s;eated, and told her, in a tone rather peremptory than threatning, that &s;he mu&s;t allow that gentleman (meaning Ryland) to accept of a &s;eat in another carriage, which was ju&s;t behind, and do him and his friends the honour of taking one of them for her companion. He received no an&s;wer to this demand, &s;he to whom it was made hav|ing fainted into the arms of her terrified fellow-traveller.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, Ryland was forced, by the inhuman ruffian and his a&s;&s;ociates, to leave her, and enter a chai&s;e which now drew up to receive him; and one of the gang, who&s;e appear|ance be&s;poke &s;omething of a higher rank than the re&s;t, &s;eated him|&s;elf by her, and was very a&s;&s;iduous in u&s;ing proper means for her reco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery.</P>
<P>When that was effected, he begged her, in terms of great politene&s;s, not to make her&s;elf in the lea&s;t unea&s;y, for that no

harm was intended.&mdash;"Oh heavens! &s;he cried, where am I&punc; What would you have? Whither would you ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y me? Where is Mr. Ryland?" 'If you mean the gentleman in who&s;e com|pany you were, madam, you may be a&s;&s;ured, that nothing ill &s;hall happen to him any more than to your&s;elf.'&mdash;"Nothing ill, &s;aid &s;he, merciful God! What do you intend to do with me?" 'I would not do you a mi&s;chief for the world, an&s;wered he: and if you will be patient for a little time, you &s;hall be &s;atisfied that you are in danger of none.' All this while they forced the po&s;t-boy, to drive on full &s;peed; and there was light enough for Har|riet to di&s;cover, that the road they took had &s;o little the appearance of a frequented one, that there was but a very &s;mall chance of her meeting with any relief.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after, however, when the moon &s;hining out made it lighter, &s;he found they were obliged to &s;lacken their pace, from being met, in a narrow part of the road, by &s;ome per&s;ons on hor&s;eback. The thoughts of relief recruited a little her exhau&s;ted &s;pirits; and having got down the front gla&s;s, &s;he called out as loud as &s;he was able, begging their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to re&s;cue a mi&s;erable creature from ruffians. One who attended the carriage by way of guard, exclaimed that it was only a poor wretch out of her &s;en&s;es, whom her friends were conveying to a place of &s;ecurity: but Harriet, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome endeavours of the man in the chai&s;e to prevent her, cried out with greater vehemence than be|fore, entreating them, for God's &s;ake, to pity and relieve her. By this time one, who had been formerly behind, came up, to the front of the party they had met, and overhearing this la&s;t &s;peech of Harriet's&mdash; "Good God! &s;aid he, can it be Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly?" Upon this her companion in the carriage, jumped out with a pi&s;tol in his hand, and pre&s;ently &s;he heard the report of fire-arms, at which the hor&s;es taking fright, ran furiou&s;ly acro&s;s the fields for a con&s;iderable way before their driver was able to &s;top them. He had &s;carcely accompli&s;hed that, when he was acco&s;ted by a &s;ervant in livery, who bade him fear nothing, for that his ma&s;ter had obliged the villains to make off.&mdash;"Eternal ble&s;&s;ings on him! cried Harriet, and to that providence who&s;e in&s;trument he is."&mdash;
'To have been of any &s;ervice to Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, replied a gentle|man who now appeared leading his hor&s;e, rewards it&s;elf.'&mdash;It was Sindall!&mdash;"Gracious powers! exclaimed the a&s;toni&s;hed Harriet, can it be you, &s;ir Thomas!" 'Compo&s;e your&s;elf, my dear Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, &s;aid he, le&s;t the &s;urprize of your deliverance &s;hould overpower your &s;pirits.'&mdash;He had opened the door of the chai&s;e, and Harriet, by a natural motion, made room for him to &s;it by her.&mdash;He accordingly gave his hor&s;e to a &s;ervant, and &s;tepped into the chai&s;e, directing the driver to &s;trike down a particular path, which would lead him to a &s;mall inn, where he had &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed the night when a hunting.</P>
<P>When he pulled up the gla&s;s, "Tell me, tell me, &s;ir Thomas, &s;aid Harriet, what guardian angel directed you &s;o unexpectedly to
<PB N="22" REF="018007_0068_0FA45DE2AA84E340">
my relief?"&mdash;"That guardian angel, my faire&s;t, which I tru&s;t will ever direct us to happine&s;s; my love, my impatient love, that could not bear the tedious days which my Harriet's pre&s;ence had cea&s;ed to brighten." &mdash; When &s;he would have expre&s;&s;ed the warmth of her gratitude for his &s;ervices; "Speak not of them, &s;aid he; I only ri&s;ked a life in thy defence, which, without thee, it is nothing to po&s;&s;e&s;s."</P>
<P>They now reached that inn to which Sindall had directed them; where, if they found a homely, yet it was a cordial reception. The landlady, who had the mo&s;t obliging and attentive behaviour in the world, having heard of the accident which had befallen the lady, produced &s;ome waters which, &s;he &s;aid, were highly cordial, and begged Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake a large gla&s;s of them; informing her, that they were made after a receit of her grandmother's, who was one of the mo&s;t notable doctre&s;&s;es in the country.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas, however, was not &s;atisfied with this pre&s;cription alone, but di&s;patched one of his &s;ervants to fetch a neighbouring &s;urgeon, as Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly's alarm, he &s;aid, might have more &s;eri|ous con&s;equences than people, ignorant of &s;uch things, could imagine.</P>
<P>For this &s;urgeon, indeed, there &s;eemed more employments than one; the &s;leeve of &s;ir Thomas's &s;hirt was di&s;covered to be all over blood, owing, as he imagined, to the grazing of a pi&s;tol-ball which had been fired at him. This him&s;elf treated very lightly, but it awakened the fears and tenderne&s;s of Harriet in the livelie&s;t manner.</P>
<P>The landlady now put a que&s;tion, which indeed might natural|ly have &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf before; to wit, Whom they &s;u&s;pected to be the in&s;tigators of this outrage? Sir Thomas an&s;wered, that, for his part, he could form no probable conjecture about the matter; and, turning to Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, a&s;ked her opinion on the &s;ubject; "Sure, &s;aid he, it cannot have been that ruffian who was rude to you at the inn where we dined."</P>
<P>Harriet an&s;wered, that &s;he could very well &s;uppo&s;e it might; adding, that though, in the confu&s;ion, &s;he did not pretend to have taken very di&s;tinct notice of things, yet &s;he thought there was a per&s;on &s;tanding at the door, near to that drunken gentleman, who had &s;ome re&s;emblance of the man that &s;at by her in the chai&s;e.</P>
<P>They were interrupted by the arrival of the &s;urgeon, which, from the vigilance of the &s;ervant, happened in a much &s;horter time than could have been expected; and Harriet peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted, that, before he took any charge of her, he &s;hould examine and dre&s;s the wound on &s;ir Thomas's arm. To this, therefore, the baronet was obliged to con&s;ent; and after having been &s;ome time with the operator in an adjoining chamber, they returned together, &s;ir Thomas's arm being &s;lung in a piece of crape, and the &s;urgeon declaring, highly to Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly's &s;atisfaction, that with proper care there was no &s;ort of danger; though, he added, that if the &s;hot had taken a direction but half an inch more to the left, it would
<PB N="23" REF="018007_0069_0FA45DE3296B35E0">
have &s;hattered the bone to pieces. This la&s;t declaration drove the blood again from Harriet's cheek, and contributed perhaps, more than any thing el&s;e, to that quickne&s;s and tremulation of pul&s;e which the &s;urgeon, on applying his finger to her wri&s;t, pronounced to be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>He ordered his patient to be undre&s;t; which was accordingly done, the landlady accommodating her with a bed-gown of her own; and then, having mulled a little wine, he mixed in it &s;ome powders of his own compo&s;ition, a &s;ecret, he &s;aid, of the greate&s;t efficacy in re-adju&s;ting any di&s;orders in the nervous &s;y&s;tem; of which draught he recommended a large tea cupful to be taken immediately.</P>
<P>Harriet objected &s;trongly again&s;t the&s;e powders, till the &s;urgeon &s;eemed to grow angry at her refu&s;al, and recapitulated, in a very rapid manner, the &s;ucce&s;s which their admini&s;tration had in many great families who did him the honour of employing him. Har|riet, the gentlene&s;s of who&s;e nature could offend no one living, overcame her reluctance, and &s;wallowed the do&s;e that was offered her &mdash;</P>
<P>The indignation of my &s;oul has with difficulty &s;ubmitted &s;o long to this cool de&s;cription of a &s;cene of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite villainy. The genuinene&s;s of my tale needs not the aid of &s;urpri&s;e, to intere&s;t the feelings of my readers. It is with horror I tell them, that the various incidents, which this and the preceding chapter contain, were but the prelude of a de&s;ign formed by Sindall for the de|&s;truction of that innocence, which was the dowry of Anne&s;ly's daughter.</P>
<P>He had contrived a rout the mo&s;t proper for the &s;ucce&s;s of his machinations, which the ignorance of Ryland was prevailed on to follow: he had bribed a &s;et of banditti to execute that &s;ham rape, which his &s;eeming valour was to prevent; he had &s;cratched his wri&s;t with a penknife, to make the appearance of being wounded in the cau&s;e; he had trained his victim to the hou&s;e of a wretch whom he had before employed in purpo&s;es of &s;imilar kind; he had dre&s;&s;ed one of his own creatures to per&s;onate a &s;urgeon, and that &s;urgeon, by his directions, had admini&s;tered certain powders, of which the damnable effects were to a&s;&s;i&s;t the execution of his villainy.</P>
<P>Be&s;et with toils like the&s;e, his helple&s;s prey was, alas! too much in his power to have any chance of e&s;cape; and that guilty night completed the ruin of her, whom, but the day before, the friend of Sindall, in the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, had recommended to his care and protection.&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me clo&s;e this chapter on the mon&s;trous deed!&mdash;That &s;uch things are, is a thought di&s;tre&s;sful to humanity &mdash;their detail can gratify no mind that de&s;erves to be gratified&mdash;They are related for the in&s;truction of the innocent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. The &s;ituation of Harriet, and the conduct of Sindall. They proceed homeward. Some incidents in their journey.</HEAD>
<P>I Would de&s;cribe, if I could, the angui&s;h which the recollecti|on of the &s;ucceeding day brought on the mind of Harriet An|ne&s;ly.&mdash;But it is in &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages that the expre&s;&s;ion of the writer will do little ju&s;tice even to his own feelings; much mu&s;t therefore be left to tho&s;e of the reader.</P>
<P>The poinancy of her own di&s;tre&s;s was doubled by the idea of her father's; a father's, who&s;e pride, who&s;e comfort, but a few weeks ago &s;he had been, to whom &s;he was now to return deprived of that innocence which could never be re&s;tored. I &s;hould rather &s;ay that honour; for guilt it could not be called, under the cir|cum&s;tances into which &s;he had been betrayed; but the world has little di&s;tinction to make; and the fall of her, whom the deepe&s;t villainy has circumvented, it brands with that common degree of infamy, which, in its ju&s;tice, it always imputes to the &s;ide of the le&s;s criminal party.</P>
<P>Sindall's pity (for we will do him no inju&s;tice) might be touched; his pa&s;&s;ion was but little abated; and he employed the language of both to comfort the affliction he had cau&s;ed. From the violence of what, by the perver&s;ion of words, is termed love, he excu&s;ed the guilt of his pa&s;t conduct, and prote&s;ted his readine&s;s to wipe it away by the future. He begged that Harriet would not &s;uffer her delicacy to make her unhappy under the &s;en&s;e of their connexion; he vowed that he con&s;idered her as his wife, and that, as &s;oon as particular circum&s;tances would allow him, he would make her what the world called &s;o, though the &s;acredne&s;s of his attachment was above being encrea&s;ed by any form whatever.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething in the mind of Harriet which allowed her little ea&s;e under all the&s;e prote&s;tations of regard; but they took off the edge of her pre&s;ent affliction, and &s;he heard them, if not with a warmth of hope, at lea&s;t with an alleviation of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>They now &s;et out on their return to the peaceful man&s;ion of Anne&s;ly How bli&s;sful, in any other circum&s;tances, had Harriet imagined the &s;ight of a father, whom &s;he now trembled to behold!</P>
<P>They had not proceeded many miles when they were met by Ry|land attended by a number of ru&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s whom he had a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e of &s;earching after Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly. It was only indeed by the lower cla&s;s that the account he gave had been credited, for which tho&s;e who did not believe it cannot much be blamed, when we con&s;ider its improbability, and likewi&s;e that Jack's per&s;ua&s;ive

powers were not of a &s;ort that ea&s;ily induce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> per&s;ua&s;ion, even when not deranged by the confu&s;ion and fright of &s;uch an adventure. His joy at finding Harriet &s;afe in the protection of &s;ir Thomas, was equally turbulent with his former fears for her welfare. After rewarding his pre&s;ent a&s;&s;ociates with the greate&s;t part of the money in his pocket, he proceeded, in a manner not the mo&s;t di&s;tinct, to give an account of what befel him&s;elf, &s;ub&s;equent to that violence which had torn him from his companion.</P>
<P>The chai&s;e, he &s;aid, into which he was forced, drove, by &s;eve|ral cro&s;s roads, about three or four miles from the place where they were fir&s;t attacked; it then &s;topping, his attendant com|manded him to get out, and, pointing to a farm-hou&s;e which, by the light of the moon, was di&s;cernible at &s;ome di&s;tance, told him, that, if he went thither, he would find accommodation for the night, and might pur&s;ue his journey with &s;afety in the morning.</P>
<P>He now demanded, in his turn, a recital from Harriet of her &s;hare of their common calamity, which &s;he gave him in the few words the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits could afford. When &s;he had ended, Ryland fell on his knees in gratitude to &s;ir Thomas for her deliverance. Harriet turned on Sindall a look infinitely expre&s;&s;ive, and it was followed by a &s;tarting tear.</P>
<P>They now proceeded to the next &s;tage on their way homeward, Sindall declaring, that, after what had happened, he would, on no account, leave Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, till he had delivered her &s;afe into the hands of her father. She heard this &s;peech with a &s;igh &s;o deep, that if Ryland had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much penetration, he would have made conjectures of &s;omething uncommon on her mind; but he was guiltle&s;s of imputing to others, what his hone&s;ty never experienced in him&s;elf. Sir Thomas ob&s;erved it better, and gently chid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t by &s;queezing her hand in his.</P>
<P>At the inn where they fir&s;t &s;topt, they met with a gentleman who made the addition of a fourth per&s;on to their party, being an offi|cer who was going down to the &s;ame part of the country on recruit|ing orders, and happened to be a particular acquaintance of &s;ir Thomas Sindall: his name was Camplin.</P>
<P>He afforded to their &s;ociety an ingredient of which at pre&s;ent it &s;eemed to &s;tand pretty much in need; to wit, a proper &s;hare of mirth and humour, for which nature &s;eemed, by a profu&s;ion of animal &s;pirits, to have very well fitted him. She had not perhaps be&s;towed on him much &s;terling wit; but &s;he had given him abun|dance of that counterfeit a&s;&s;urance, which frequently pa&s;&s;es more current than the real. In this company, to which chance had a&s;|&s;ociated him, he had an additional advantage from the pre&s;ence of Ryland, whom he very &s;oon di&s;covered to be of that order of men called Buts, tho&s;e ea&s;y cu&s;hions (to borrow a metaphor of Otway's) on whom the wits of the world repo&s;e and fatten.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, he had a fund of conver&s;ation ari&s;ing from the adventures of a life which, according to his own account, he had
<PB N="26" REF="018007_0073_0FA454A382F1DC48">
pa&s;&s;ed equally in the perils of war and the luxuries of peace; his memoirs affording repeated in&s;tances of his valour in dangers of the field, his addre&s;s in the &s;ociety of the great, and his gallantry in connexions with the fair.</P>
<P>But le&s;t the reader &s;hould imagine, that the real portraiture of this gentleman was to be found in tho&s;e lineaments which he drew of him&s;elf, I will take the liberty candidly, though briefly, to communicate &s;ome particulars relating to his quality, his &s;ituation, and his character.</P>
<P>He was the &s;on of a man who called him&s;elf an attorney, in a village adjoining to &s;ir Thomas Sindall's e&s;tate. His father, &s;ir William, with whom I made my readers a little acquainted in the beginning of my &s;tory, had found this &s;ame lawyer u&s;eful in carry|ing on &s;ome proceedings again&s;t his poor neighbours, which the delicacy of more e&s;tabli&s;hed practitioners in the law might po&s;&s;ibly have boggled at; and he had grown into con&s;equence with the baronet, from that pliancy of di&s;po&s;ition which was &s;o &s;uited to his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Not that &s;ir William was naturally cruel or oppre&s;&s;ive; but he had an exalted idea of the con&s;equence which a great e&s;tate confers on its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, which was irritated beyond mea&s;ure when any favorite &s;cheme of his was oppo&s;ed by a man of little fortune, however ju&s;t or proper his rea&s;ons for oppo&s;ition might be; and, though a <HI>good &s;ort of man,</HI> as I have before ob&s;erved, his vengeance was implacable.</P>
<P>Young Camplin, who was nearly of an age with ma&s;ter Tommy Sindall, was frequently at &s;ir William's in quality of a dependant companion to his &s;on; and, before the baronet died, he had pro|cured him an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion in a regiment, which &s;ome years after was &s;tationed in one of our garri&s;ons abroad, where Camplin, much again&s;t his inclination, was under a nece&s;&s;ity of joining it, Here he happened to have an opportunity of obliging the chief in command by certain little offices, which, though not &s;trictly hon|ourable in them&s;elves, are &s;anctified by the favour and counte|nance of many honourable men; and &s;o much did they attach his commander to the en&s;ign, that the latter was very &s;oon promoted by his intere&s;t to the rank of a lieutenant, and not long after was enabled to make a very advantageous purchace of a company. With this patron al&s;o he returned to England, and was received at all times in a very familiar manner into his hou&s;e; where he had the honour of carving good di&s;hes which he was &s;ometimes permitted to ta&s;te, of laughing at jokes which he was &s;ometimes al|lowed to make, and carried an ob&s;equious face into all companies, who were not treated with &s;uch extraordinary re&s;pect as to preclude his approach.</P>
<P>About this time his father, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s in the country had not encrea&s;ed &s;ince the death of &s;ir William Sindall, had &s;ettled in London, where the reader will recollect the having met with him in a former chapter; but the captain, during his patron's re&s;i|dence

there, lived too near St. James's to make many vi&s;its to Gray's Inn; and after that gentleman left the town, he continued to move amid&s;t a circle of men of fa&s;hion, with whom he contrived to live in a manner which has been often defined by the expre&s;&s;i|on of, "nobody knows how."</P>
<P>Which &s;ort of life he had followed uninterruptedly, without ever joining his regiment, till he was now obliged, by the change of a colonel, to take &s;ome of the duty in his turn, and was order|ed a recruiting, as I have taken due occa&s;ion to relate.</P>
<P>In this company did Harriet return to her father. As the news of di&s;a&s;ter is commonly &s;peedy in its cour&s;e, the good man had al|ready been confu&s;edly informed of the attack which had been made on his daughter. To him therefore this meeting was &s;o joyful, as almo&s;t to blot from his remembrance the calamities which had lately befallen his family.</P>
<P>But far different were the &s;en&s;ations of Harriet: &s;he &s;hrunk from the &s;ight of a parent, of who&s;e purity &s;he now conceived her|&s;elf unworthy, and fell blu&s;hing on his neck, which &s;he bathed with a profu&s;ion of tears. This he imagined to proceed from her &s;en&s;ibility of tho&s;e woes which her unhappy brother had &s;uffered; and he forbore to take notice of her di&s;tre&s;s, any otherwi&s;e than by maintaining a degree of chearfulne&s;s him&s;elf, much above what the feelings of his heart could warrant.</P>
<P>He was attended, when her fellow-travellers accompanied Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly to his hou&s;e, by a gentleman, whom he now introduced to her by the name of Rawlin&s;on, &s;aying he was a very worthy friend of his, who had lately returned from abroad. Harriet in|deed recollected to have heard her father mention &s;uch a one in their conver&s;ations before. Though a good deal younger than Anne&s;ly, he had been a very intimate &s;chool-fellow of his in Lon|don, from which place he was &s;ent to the Ea&s;t Indies, and re|turned, as was common in tho&s;e days, with &s;ome thou&s;and pounds, and a good con&s;cience, to his native country.</P>
<P>A genuine plainne&s;s of manners, and a warm benevolence of heart, neither the refinements of life, nor the &s;ubtleties of traffic, had been able to weaken in Rawlin&s;on; and he &s;et out, under the impre&s;&s;ion of both, immediately after his arrival in England, to vi&s;it a companion, who&s;e virtues he remembered with veneration, and the value of who&s;e friend&s;hip he had not forgotten. Anne&s;ly received him with that welcome which his fire-&s;ide ever afforded to the worthy; and Harriet, through the dimne&s;s of her grief, &s;miled on the friend of her father.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. Something farther of Mr. Rawlin&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>RAWLINSON found his reception &s;o agreeable, that he lengthened his vi&s;it much beyond the limits which he at fir&s;t intended it; and the earne&s;t reque&s;t of Anne&s;ly, to whom his friend's company was equally plea&s;ing, extended them &s;till a little farther.</P>
<P>During this period, he had daily opportunities of ob&s;erving the amiable di&s;po&s;itions of Harriet. He ob&s;erved, indeed, a degree of melancholy about her, which &s;eemed extraordinary in one of her age&punc; but he was &s;atisfied to account for it, from the relation, which her father had given him, of the &s;ituation of his &s;on, and that remarkable tenderne&s;s of which his daughter was &s;u&s;ceptible. When viewed in this light, it added to the good opinion which he already entertained of her.</P>
<P>His e&s;teem for Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly &s;howed it&s;elf by every mark of at|tention, which a regard for the other &s;ex unavoidably prompts in ours; and a young woman, or her father, who had no more pene|tration in tho&s;e matters than is common to many, would not have he&s;itated to pronounce that Rawlin&s;on was already the lover of Harriet. But as neither &s;he nor her father had any wi&s;hes pointing that way, which had been one great index for di&s;covery, they were void of any &s;u&s;picion of his intentions, till he declared them to Anne&s;ly him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He did this with an openne&s;s and &s;incerity conformable to the whole of his character. He told his friend that he had now made &s;uch a fortune as enabled him to live independantly, and that he looked for a companion to participate it, who&s;e good &s;en&s;e would improve what were worthy, and who&s;e good-nature would bear what were imperfect in him. He had di&s;covered, he &s;aid, &s;o much of both in the mind of Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, that there needed not the recommendation of being the daughter of his worthie&s;t friend to determine his choice; and that, though he was not old enough to be in&s;en&s;ible to beauty, yet he was wi&s;e enough to con&s;ider it as the lea&s;t of her good qualities. He added, that he made this application to her father, not to a&s;k a partial exertion of his intere&s;t in his favour, but only, as the common friend of both, to reveal his intentions to Mi&s;s Harriet. "She has &s;een me, &s;aid he, as I am; if not a romantic lover, I &s;hall not be a different &s;ort of being, &s;hould &s;he accept of me for a hu&s;band; if &s;he does not, I promi&s;e you, I &s;hall be far from being offended, and will always endeavour to retain her for my friend, whom I have no right to blame for not chu&s;ing to be my wife."</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly communicated this propo&s;al to his daughter, with a fairne&s;s, worthy of that with which it had been entru&s;ted to him: "I come not, &s;aid he, my Harriet, as a de&s;pot to command,
<PB N="29" REF="018007_0076_0FA454A7B69B10A0">
not as a father to per&s;uade, but merely as the friend of Mr. Raw|lin&s;on, to di&s;clo&s;e his &s;entiments; that you &s;hould judge for your&s;elf, in a matter of the highe&s;t importance to you, is the voice of rea&s;on and of nature; I blu&s;h for tho&s;e parents who have thought otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>"I would not even, with a view to this particular ca&s;e, obtrude my advice; in general you have heard my opinion before, that the violence which we have been accu&s;tomed to apply to love, is not always nece&s;&s;ary towards happine&s;s in marriage; at the &s;ame time, that it is a trea&s;on of the highe&s;t kind in a woman to take him for her hu&s;band, whom a decent affection has not placed in that &s;ituation, whence alone &s;he &s;hould chu&s;e one. But my Harriet has not merely been taught &s;entiments; I know &s;he has learned the art of forming them; and here &s;he &s;hall be tru&s;ted entirely to her own."</P>
<P>The feelings of Harriet on this propo&s;al, and the manner in which her father communicated it, were of &s;o tender a kind, that &s;he could not re&s;train her tears. There wanted, indeed, but little to induce her to confe&s;s all that had pa&s;&s;ed with Sindall, and throw her&s;elf on the clemency of her indulgent parent. Had &s;he practi|&s;ed this &s;incerity, which is the la&s;t virtue we &s;hould ever part with, how happy had it been! But it required a degree of fortitude, as well as &s;oftne&s;s, to make this di&s;covery; be&s;ides, that her &s;e|ducer had, with the tendere&s;t entreaties, and a&s;&s;urances of a &s;peedy reparation of her injuries, prevailed on her to give him &s;omething like a promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy.</P>
<P>Her an&s;wer to this offer of Mr. Rawlin&s;on's, expre&s;&s;ed her &s;en&s;e of the obligation &s;he lay under to him, and to her father; &s;he a|vowed an e&s;teem for his character equal to its excellence, but that it amounted not to that tender regard which &s;he mu&s;t feel for the man whom &s;he could think of making her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Rawlin&s;on received his friend's account of this determination without di&s;compo&s;ure. He &s;aid he knew him&s;elf well enough to believe that Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly had made an hone&s;t and a proper decla|ration; and begged to have an interview with her&s;elf, to &s;how her that he conceived not the &s;malle&s;t re&s;entment at her refu&s;al, which, on the contrary, though it de&s;troyed his hopes, had encrea&s;ed his veneration for her.</P>
<P>"Regard me not, &s;aid he to her when they met, with that a&s;pect of di&s;tance, as if you had offended or affronted me; let me not lo&s;e that look of kindne&s;s which, as the friend of your father and your&s;elf, I have formerly experienced. I confe&s;s there is one di&s;parity between us, which we elderly men are apt to forget, but which I take no offence at being put in mind of. It is more than probable that I &s;hall never be married at all.</P>
<P>Since I am not a match for you Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, I would endeavour to make you &s;omewhat better, if it is po&s;&s;ible, for another; do me the favour to accept of this paper, and let it &s;peak for me, that I would contribute to your happine&s;s, without the &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ider|ation
<PB N="30" REF="018007_0077_0FA454A7EB5984D8">
of its being made one with my own." So &s;aying, he bowed and retired into an adjoining apartment, where his friend was &s;eated. Harriet, upon opening the paper, found it to contain bank bills to the amount of a thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Her &s;urpri&s;e at this in&s;tance of genero&s;ity held her, for a few moments, fixed to the &s;pot; but &s;he no &s;ooner recollected her&s;elf, than &s;he followed Mr. Rawlin&s;on, and putting the paper, with its contents, into his hand: "Though I feel, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, with the utmo&s;t gratitude, tho&s;e &s;entiments of kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity you have expre&s;&s;ed towards me, you will excu&s;e me, I hope, from receiving this mark of them."&mdash;Rawlin&s;on's countenance betrayed &s;ome indications of di&s;plea&s;ure.&mdash;"You do wrong, &s;aid he, young lady, and I will be judged by your father&mdash;This was a pre&s;ent, &s;ir, I intended for the worthie&s;t woman, the daughter of my worthie&s;t friend; &s;he is woman &s;till, I &s;ee, and her pride will, no more than her affections, &s;ubmit it&s;elf to my happine&s;s." Anne&s;ly looked upon the bank-bills; "There is a delicacy, my be&s;t friend, &s;aid he, in our &s;ituation; the poor mu&s;t ever be cautious, and there is a certain degree of pride which is their &s;afe&s;t virtue." &mdash;"Let me tell you, interrupted the other, this is not the pride of virtue.&mdash;It is that fanta&s;tic nicety which is a weakne&s;s in the &s;oul, and the dignity of great minds is above it. Believe me, the churli&s;hne&s;s which cannot oblige, is little more &s;elfi&s;h, though in a different mode, than the haughtine&s;s which will not be obliged."</P>
<P>"We are in&s;tructed, my child," &s;aid Anne&s;ly, delivering her the paper; "let us &s;how Mr. Rawlin&s;on, that we have not that narrowne&s;s of mind which he has cen&s;ured; and that we will pay that la&s;t tribute to his worth which the receiving of a favour be&s;tows."</P>
<P>"Indeed, &s;ir, &s;aid Harriet, I little de&s;erve it; I am not, I am not what he thinks me.&mdash;I am not worthy of his regard." &mdash;And &s;he bur&s;t into tears.&mdash;They knew not why &s;he wept; but their eyes &s;hed each a &s;ympathetic drop, without a&s;king their rea&s;on's leave.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawlin&s;on &s;peedily &s;et out for London, where his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary towards di&s;patching &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s he had left un|fini&s;hed, after his return to England.</P>
<P>He left his friend, and his friend's amiable daughter, with a tender regret; while they, who, in their humble walk of life, had few to whom that title would belong, felt his ab&s;ence with an equal emotion</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed, however, at his departure, to make them another vi&s;it with the return of the &s;pring.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. Captain Camplin is again introduced.&mdash;The &s;iua|tion of Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, with that gentleman's concern in her affairs.</HEAD>
<P>HIS place was but ill &s;upplied, at their winter's fire-&s;ide, by the occa&s;ional vi&s;its of Camplin, whom Sindall had intro|duced to Anne&s;ly's acquaintance. Yet, though his was a character on which Anne&s;ly could not be&s;tow much of his e&s;teem, it had &s;ome good-humoured qualities, which did not fail to entertain and amu&s;e him.</P>
<P>But the captain &s;eemed to be le&s;s agreeable in that quarter to which he principally pointed his attention, to wit, the opinion of Harriet, to whom he took frequent occa&s;ion to make tho&s;e &s;peeches, which have ju&s;t enough of folly in them to acquire the name of compliments, and &s;ometimes even ventured to turn them in &s;o particular a manner, as if he wi&s;hed to have them under&s;tood to mean &s;omewhat more.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the unfortunate Harriet was &s;uch as his plea|&s;antry could not divert, and his attachment could only di&s;gu&s;t. As &s;he had lo&s;t that peace of mind which inward &s;atisfaction alone can be&s;tow, &s;o &s;he felt the calamity doubled, by that obligation to &s;ecrecy &s;he was under, and the difficulty which her pre&s;ent condi|tion (for &s;he was now with child) made &s;uch a concealment be at|tended with.</P>
<P>Often had &s;he determined to reveal, either to her father or to Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, who, of her own &s;ex, was her only friend, the &s;tory of her di&s;honour; but Sindall, by repeated &s;olicitations when in the country, and a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence when in town, con|jured her to be &s;ilent for &s;ome little time, till he could &s;mooth the way for be&s;towing his hand on the only woman whom he had ever &s;incerely loved.</P>
<P>One principal rea&s;on for his po&s;tponing their union, had always been the nece&s;&s;ity for endeavouring to gain over the a&s;&s;ent of his grandfather by the mother's &s;ide, from whom Sindall had great ex|pectations; he had, from time to time, &s;ugge&s;ted this as difficult, and only to be attempted with caution, from the proud and touchy di&s;po&s;ition of the old gentleman: he now repre&s;ented him as in a very declining &s;tate of health, and that, probably, in a very &s;hort time, his death would remove this ob&s;tacle to the warme&s;t wi&s;h of a heart, that was ever faithful to his Harriet. The flattering language of his letters could not arre&s;t the progre&s;s of that time, which mu&s;t divulge the &s;hame of her he had undone; but they &s;oothed the tumults of a &s;oul to whom his villainy was yet unknown and who&s;e affections his appearance of worth, of friend&s;hip, and moolene&s;s of mind, had but too much entangled.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="018007_0079_0FA454ABF985A1B8">However imperfectly he had accounted for delaying a marriage, which he always profe&s;&s;ed his intention to perform, the delu&s;ion was kept up in the expectations of Harriet, till that period began to draw near, when it would be impo&s;&s;ible any longer to conceal from the world the effects of their intimacy. Then, indeed, her unea&s;ine&s;s was not to be allayed by &s;uch excu&s;es as Sindall had be|fore relied on her artle&s;s confidence to believe.</P>
<P>He wrote her, therefore, an an&s;wer to a letter full of the mo&s;t earne&s;t as well as tender expo&s;tulations, informing her, of his having determined to run any ri&s;k of inconvenience to him&s;elf, rather than &s;uffer her to remain longer in a &s;tate, &s;uch as &s;he had (pathetically indeed) de&s;cribed. That he was to &s;et out in a few days for the country, to make him&s;elf indi&s;&s;olubly hers; but that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould allow him to conduct their marrige in a particular manner, which he would communi|cate to her on his arrival; and begged, as &s;he valued his peace and her own, that the whole matter might &s;till remain inviolably &s;ecret as &s;he had hitherto kept it.</P>
<P><HI>In a few days after the receit of this letter, &s;he received a note from Camplin, importing his de&s;ire to have an interview with her on &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s, which related equally to her and to &s;ir Thomas Sindall. The time he appointed was early in the morning of the &s;uc|ceeding day; and the place, a little walk which the villagers u&s;ed to frequent in holiday-times, at the back of her father's garden. This was delivere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to her, in a &s;ecret manner, by a little boy, an attend|ant of that gentleman's, who was a frequent gue&s;t in Anne&s;ly's kitchen, from his talent at playing the flagelet, which he had acquired in the capacity of a drummer to the regiment to which his ma&s;ter belonged. My&s;terious as the contents of this note were, the mind of Harriet ea&s;ily &s;ugge&s;ted to her, that Camplin had been, in &s;ome re&s;pect at lea&s;t, let into the confidence of &s;ir Thomas. She now felt the want of that digni|ty which innocence be&s;tows; &s;he blu&s;hed and trembled, even in the pre|&s;ence of this little boy, becau&s;e he was Camplin's; and with a &s;haking hand, &s;crawled a note in an&s;wer to that he had brought her, to let his ma&s;ter know, that &s;he would meet him at the hour he had appoint|ed. &mdash; She met him accordingly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He began with making many prote&s;tations of his regard, hath for Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly and the baronet, which had induced him, he &s;aid, to dedicate him&s;elf to the &s;ervice of both in this affair, though it was a matter of &s;uch delicacy as he would not otherwi&s;e have cho&s;en to interfere in; and putting into her hand a letter from Sindall, told her, he had taken mea&s;ures for carrying into excution the purpo&s;e it contained</HI></P>
<P><HI>It informed her that &s;ir Thomas was in the hou&s;e of an old dome&s;tic at &s;ome miles di&s;tance, where he waited to be made hers. That he had for this &s;ecrecy many rea&s;ons, with which he could not by &s;uch a conveyance make her acquainted, but which her own prudence would probably &s;ugge&s;t. He concluded with recommending her to the care and protection of Camplin, who&s;e honour he warmly extolled.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. The effects which the event contained in the preced|ing chapter had on Mr. Anne&s;ly.</HEAD>
<P>THE receit of that note which Harriet was per&s;uaded by Camplin to write to her father, (intimating that &s;he was gone upon a vi&s;it to a family in the neighbourhood, and not to re|turn till the evening) though her time of going abroad was &s;ome|what unu&s;ual, did not create any &s;urpri&s;e in the mind of Anne&s;ly; but it happened that Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, who called in the afternoon to enquire after her young friend, had ju&s;t left the very hou&s;e where her me&s;&s;age imported her vi&s;it to be made.</P>
<P>This &s;et her father on conjecturing, yet without much anxiety, and with no &s;u&s;picion: but his fears were redoubled when, hav|ing &s;at up till a very late hour, no tidings arrived of his daughter. He went to bed, however, though it could not afford him &s;leep; at every bark of the village-dogs his heart bounded with the hopes of her return; but the morning ro&s;e, and did not re&s;tore him his Harriet.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="018007_0081_0FA454AEB1751648">His unea&s;ine&s;s had been ob&s;erved by his &s;ervants, to whom he was too indulgent a ma&s;ter to have his intere&s;ts con&s;idered by them with le&s;s warmth than their own. Abraham, therefore, who was coeval with his ma&s;ter, and had &s;erved him ever &s;ince he was mar|ried, had &s;allied forth by day-break on &s;earch of intelligence. He was met accidentally by a hunt&s;man of &s;ir Thomas Sindall's, who informed him, that as he cro&s;&s;ed the lane at the back of the vil|lage the morning before, he &s;aw Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly leaning on captain Camplin's arm, and walking with him towards a chai&s;e and four, which &s;tood at the end of it.</P>
<P>Abraham's cheeks grew pale at this intelligence; becau&s;e he had a &s;ort of in&s;tinctive terror for Camplin, who was in u&s;e to make his awkward &s;implicity a fund for many je&s;ts, and tricks of mi&s;|chief, during his vi&s;its to Anne&s;ly. He ha&s;tened home to commu|nicate this di&s;covery to his ma&s;ter, which he did with a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ltering tongue, and many ejaculations of fear and &s;urpri&s;e. Anne&s;ly re|ceived it with le&s;s emotion, though not without an encrea&s;e of un|ea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"Yonder, &s;aid Abraham, looking through the window, is the captain's little boy;" and he ran out of the room to bring him to an examination. The lad, upon being interrogated, confe&s;&s;ed that his ma&s;ter had &s;ent him to hire a chai&s;e, which was to be in waiting at the end of that lane I have formerly mentioned, at an early hour in the morning, and that he &s;aw Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly go into it attended by the captain, who had not, any more than Mi&s;s Har|riet, been at home or heard of &s;ince that time.</P>
<P>This declaration deprived Anne&s;ly of utterance; but it only ad|ded to the warmth of Abraham's inqui&s;ition, who now mingling threats with his que&s;tions, drew from the boy the &s;ecret, of his having privately delivered a letter, from his ma&s;ter to Mi&s;s An|ne&s;ly, the very night preceding the day of their departure; and that a man of his acquaintance, who had &s;topt, about mid-day, at the alehou&s;e where he was quartered, told him, by way of conver|&s;ation, that he had met his ma&s;ter with a lady, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed, jeeringly, he was running away with, driving at a great rate on the road towards London.</P>
<P>Abraham made a &s;ign to the boy to leave the room. &mdash; "My poor dear young lady!" &s;aid he, as he &s;hut the door, and the tears gu&s;hed from his eyes. His ma&s;ter's were turned upwards, to that Being to whom calamity ever directed them. &mdash; The maid-&s;ervant now entered the room, uttering &s;ome broken exclamations of &s;or|row, which a violent &s;obbing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">endered inarticulate.&mdash;Anne&s;ly had fini&s;hed his account with heaven; and addre&s;&s;ing her with a degree of calmne&s;s, which the good man could derive only thence, a&s;ked her the cau&s;e of her being afflicted in &s;o unu&s;ual a manner.</P>
<P>"Oh, &s;ir! &s;aid &s;he, &s;tifling her tears, I have heard what the captain's boy has been telling; I fear it is but too true, and wor&s;e than you imagine! God forgive me if I wrong Mi&s;s Harriet;
<PB N="35" REF="018007_0082_0FA454AF6F553FA0">
but I &s;u&s;pect&mdash;I have &s;u&s;pected for &s;ome time&mdash;&s;he bur&s;t into tears again!&mdash;that my young lady is with child."&mdash;Anne&s;ly had &s;tretched his fortitude to the utmo&s;t&mdash;this la&s;t blow overcame it, and he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor! Abraham threw him&s;elf down by him, tearing his white looks, and acting all the frantic extravagances of grief. But the maid was more u&s;eful to her ma&s;ter; and hav|ing rai&s;ed him gently, and chafed his temples, he began to &s;how &s;ome &s;igns of reviving; when Abraham recollected him&s;elf &s;o far as to a&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t his fellow-&s;ervant in carrying him to his chamber, and laying him on his bed, where he recovered the powers of life, and the &s;en&s;e of his misfortune.</P>
<P>Their endeavours for his recovery were &s;econded by Mrs&punc; Wi&s;tanly, who had made this early vi&s;it to &s;atisfy &s;ome doubts which &s;he, as well as Anne&s;ly, had conceived, even from the information of the preceding day When he fir&s;t regained the u&s;e of &s;peech, he complained of a violent &s;hivering, for which this good lady, from the little &s;kill &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in phy&s;ic, pre&s;cribed &s;ome &s;imple remedies, and at the &s;ame time di&s;patched Abraham for an apothecary in the neighbourhood, who commonly attended the family.</P>
<P>Before this gentleman arrived, Anne&s;ly had received &s;o much temporary relief from Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's pre&s;criptions, as to be able to &s;peak with more ea&s;e, than the ince&s;&s;ant quivering of his lips had before allowed him to do. "Alas! &s;aid he, Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, have you heard of my Harriet?"&mdash;"I have, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, with equal a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;orrow; yet let me entreat you not to abandon that hope which the pre&s;ent uncertainty may warrant. I cannot allow my&s;elf to think that things are &s;o ill as your &s;er|vants have informed me."&mdash;"My foreboding heart, &s;aid he, tells me they are; I remember many circum&s;tances now, which all meet to confirm my fears. Oh! Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, &s;he was my darling, the idol of my heart! perhaps too much &s;o&mdash;the will of heaven be done!"&mdash;</P>
<P>The apothecary now arrived, who, upon examining into the &s;tate of his patient, ordered &s;ome warm applications to remove that univer&s;al coldne&s;s he complained of, and left him, with a promi&s;e of returning in a few hours, when he had fini&s;hed &s;ome vi&s;its, which he was under a nece&s;&s;ity of making in the village.</P>
<P>When he returned, he found Mr. Anne&s;ly altered for the wor&s;e; the cold which the latter felt before, having given place to a burn|ing heat, He therefore told Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, at going away, that in the evening he would bring a phy&s;ician, with whom he had an appointment at a gentleman's not very di&s;tant, to &s;ee Mr. Anne&s;ly, as his &s;ituation appeared to him to be attended with &s;ome alarming circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>His fears of danger were ju&s;tified by the event, When the&s;e gentlemen &s;aw Mr. Anne&s;ly in the evening, his fever was encrea&s;|ed. Next day, after a re&s;tle&s;s night, they found every bad &s;ymptom confirmed: they tried every method which medical &s;kill could

&s;ugge&s;t for his relief, but, during four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, their en|deavours proved ineffectual; and at the expiration of that time they told his friend, Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, who had enjoyed almo&s;t as little &s;leep as the &s;ick man whom &s;he watched, that unle&s;s &s;ome favorable cri&s;is &s;hould happen &s;oon, the wor&s;t con&s;equences were much to be feared.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. The arrival of Mr. Rawlin&s;on. Anne&s;ly's di&s;|cour&s;e with him. That gentleman's account of his friend's illne&s;s, and its con&s;equences.</HEAD>
<P>AT this melancholy period it happened that Mr. Rawlin&s;on arrived, in pur&s;uance of that promi&s;e which Anne&s;ly had obtained from him, at the time of his departure for London.</P>
<P>There needed not that warmth of heart we have formerly de&s;cribed in this gentleman, to feel the accumulated di&s;tre&s;s to which his worthy friend was reduced. Nor was his a&s;toni&s;hment at the account which he received of Harriet's elopement le&s;s, than his pity for the &s;ufferings it had brought upon her father.</P>
<P>From the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Anne&s;ly's family, he did not chu&s;e to incommode them with any trouble of provi&s;ion for him. He took up his quarters therefore at the only inn, a paltry one indeed, which the village afforded, and re&s;olved to remain there till he &s;aw what i&s;&s;ue his friend's pre&s;ent illne&s;s &s;hould have, and endeavour to admini&s;ter &s;ome comfort, either to the la&s;t moments of his life, or to that affliction which his recovery could not remove.</P>
<P>In the evening of the day on which he arrived, Anne&s;ly &s;eemed to feel a &s;ort of relief from the violence of his di&s;ea&s;e. He &s;poke with a degree of coolne&s;s which he had never before been able to command; and after having talked &s;ome little time with his phy|&s;ician, he told Abraham, who &s;eldom quitted his bed &s;ide, that he thought he had &s;een Mr. Rawlin&s;on enter the room in the morning, though he was in a confu&s;ed &s;lumber at the time, and might have mi&s;taken a dream for the reality.</P>
<P>Upon Abraham's informing him&punc; that Mr. Rawlin&s;on had been there, that he had left the hou&s;e but a moment before, and that he was to remain in the village for &s;ome time, he expre&s;&s;ed the warm|e&s;t &s;atisfaction at the intelligence; and having made Abraham fetch him a paper which lay in his bureau, &s;ealed up in a particular manner, he di&s;patched him to the inn where his friend was, with a me&s;&s;age, importing an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee him as &s;oon as &s;hould be convenient.</P>
<P>Rawlin&s;on had already returned to the hou&s;e, and was by this time &s;tealing up &s;tairs, to watch at the bed-&s;ide of his friend, for which ta&s;k Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's former uncea&s;ing &s;olicitude had now
<PB N="37" REF="018007_0084_0FA454B31FA8C838">
rendered her unfit. He was met by Abraham with a gleam of joy on his countenance, from the happy change which he thought he ob&s;erved in his ma&s;ter; and was conducted to the &s;ide of the bed by that faithful dome&s;tic, who placed him in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> chair, that the doctor had ju&s;t occupied by his patient.</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly &s;tretched out his hands, and &s;queezed that of Rawlin&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> between them for &s;ome time without &s;peaking a word. "I ble&s;s God, &s;aid he at la&s;t, that he has &s;ent me a comforter, at a moment when I &s;o much need one. You mu&s;t by this time have heard, my friend, of that late&s;t and greate&s;t of my family-misfortunes, with which providence has afflicted me."&mdash;"You know, my dear &s;ir, an&s;wered Rawlin&s;on, that no one would more &s;incerely feel for your &s;orrows than I; but at pre&s;ent it is a &s;ubject too tender for you."&mdash;"Do not &s;ay &s;o, replied his friend; it will ea&s;e my labouring heart to &s;peak of it to my Rawlin&s;on: but in the fir&s;t place I have a little bu&s;ine&s;s which I will now di&s;patch. Here is a deed making over all my effects to you, &s;ir, and at your death, to any one you &s;hall name your executor in that tru&s;t for my children&mdash;if I have any children remaining!&mdash;Into your hands I deliver it with a peculiar &s;atisfaction, and I know there will not need the de&s;ire of a dying friend to add to your zeal for their &s;ervice. &mdash; Why &s;hould that word &s;tartle you? death is to me a me&s;&s;enger of con&s;olation!" He pau&s;ed!&mdash;Rawlin&s;on put up the paper in &s;ilence, for his heart was too full to allow him the u&s;e of words for an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"When I lo&s;t my &s;on, continued Anne&s;ly, I &s;uffered in &s;ilence; and though it preyed on me in &s;ecret, I bore up again&s;t the weight of my &s;orrow, that I might not weaken in my&s;elf that &s;tay which heaven had provided for my Harriet. She was then my only remaining comfort, &s;aved like &s;ome precious trea&s;ure from the &s;hipwreck of my family; and I fondly hoped that my age might go down &s;moothly to its re&s;t, amid&s;t the endearments of a daugh|ter's care.&mdash;I have now lived to &s;ee the la&s;t re&s;ting-place which my &s;oul could find in this world, laid wa&s;te and de&s;olate!&mdash;yet to that Being, who&s;e goodne&s;s is infinite as his ways are in&s;crutable, let me bend in reverence! I ble&s;s his name that he has not yet taken from me that tru&s;t in him, which to lo&s;e is the only irreme|diable calamity&punc; it is now indeed that I feel its efficacy mo&s;t, when every ray of human comfort is extingui&s;hed. As for me&mdash; my deliverance is at hand; I feel &s;omething here at my heart that tells me, I &s;hall not have long to &s;trive with in&s;ufferable affliction.</P>
<P>My poor deluded daughter&mdash;I commit to thee, Father of all! by whom the wanderings of thy unhappy children are &s;een with pity, and to whom their return cannot be too late to be accepted! If my friend &s;hould live to &s;ee her look back with contrition towards that path from which &s;he has &s;trayed, I know his good|ne&s;s will lead her &s;teps to find it&mdash;Show her her father's grave! yet &s;pare her for his &s;ake, who cannot then comfort or &s;upport her!"</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="018007_0085_0FA455786ECDF2E8">The re&s;t of this narration I will give the reader in Mr. Raw|lin&s;on's own words, from a letter of his I have now lying before me, of which I will tran&s;cribe the latter part, beginning its recital at the clo&s;e of this pathetic addre&s;s of his friend.</P>
<P>As I had been told (&s;ays this gentleman) that he had not enjoyed one &s;ound &s;leep &s;ince his daughter went away, I left him now to compo&s;e him&s;elf to re&s;t, de&s;iring his &s;ervant to call me in&s;tantly, if he ob&s;erved any thing particular about his ma&s;ter. He whi&s;per|ed me,
<Q>that when he &s;at up with him the night before, he could overhear him at times talk wildly, and mutter to him&s;elf like one &s;peaking in one's &s;leep; that then he would &s;tart, &s;igh deeply, and &s;eem again to recollect him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>I went back to his ma&s;ter's bed-&s;ide, and begged him to endeav|our to calm his mind &s;o much as not to prevent that repo&s;e which he &s;tood &s;o greatly in need of. "I have prevailed on my phy&s;ici|an, an&s;wered he, to give me an opiate for that purpo&s;e, and I think I now feel drow&s;y from its effects." I wi&s;hed him good night. &mdash;"Good night, &s;aid he, &mdash;but give me your hand; it is perhaps the la&s;t time I &s;hall ever cla&s;p it!"</P>
<P>He lifted up his eyes to heaven, holding my hand in his, then turned away his face, and laid his head upon his pillow.&mdash;I could not lay mine to re&s;t: Alas! &s;aid I, that &s;uch &s;hould be the portion of virtue like Anne&s;ly's; yet to arraign the di&s;tribution of pro|vidence, had been to forget that le&s;&s;on which the be&s;t of men had ju&s;t been teaching me;&mdash;but the doubtings, the darkne&s;s of feeble man, &s;till hung about my heart.</P>
<P>When I &s;ent in the morning, I was told that he was &s;till a&s;leep, but that his re&s;t was ob&s;erved to be frequently di&s;turbed by groans and &s;tartings, and that he breathed much thicker than he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver done hitherto, I went my&s;elf to get more perfect intelligence; his faithful Abraham met me at the door.&mdash;
<Q>Oh &s;ir, &s;aid he, my poor ma&s;ter!</Q>
&mdash;'What is the matter?'&mdash;
<Q>I fear, &s;ir, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in not in his perfect &s;en&s;es: for he talks more wildly than even, and yet he is broad awake.</Q>
&mdash; He led me into the room; I placed my&s;elf directly before him; but his eye, though it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ed on mine, did not &s;eem to acknowlege its object. There was a glazing on it that deadened its look.</P>
<P>He muttered &s;omething in a very low voice.&mdash;"How does my friend?" &s;aid I.&mdash;He &s;uffered me to take his hand, but an&s;wered nothing. &mdash; After li&s;tening &s;ome time, I could hear the name of Harriet. "Do you want any thing, my dear &s;ir?" He moved his lips, but I heard not what he &s;aid. &mdash; I repeated my que&s;tion; he look'd up piteou&s;ly in my face, then turned his eye round as if he mi&s;&s;ed &s;ome object on which it meant to re&s;t. &mdash; He &s;hivered, and caught hold of Abraham's hand, who &s;tood at the &s;ide of the bed oppo&s;ite me.&mdash;He looked round again, then uttered with a fee|ble and broken voice,

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. What befel Harriet Anne&s;ly on her leaving her father.</HEAD>
<P>I AM not in a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;top in the mid&s;t of this part of my recital, &s;olicitous to embelli&s;h, or &s;tudious to arrange it. My readers &s;hall receive it &s;imple, as becomes a tale of &s;orrow, and I flatter my&s;elf, they are at this moment readier to feel than to judge it.</P>
<P>They have &s;een Harriet Anne&s;ly, by the artifice of Sindall, and the agency of Camplin, tempted to leave the hou&s;e of her father, in hopes of meeting the man who had betrayed her, and of re|ceiving that only reparation for her injuries which it was now in his power to make.</P>
<P>But &s;ir Thomas never entertained the mo&s;t di&s;tant thought of that marriage, with the hopes of which he had deluded her. Yet, though he was not &s;ubject to the internal principles of honour or morality, he was man of the world enough to know their value in the e&s;timation of others. The virtues of Anne&s;ly had &s;o much endeared him to every one within their reach, that this outrage of Sindall's again&s;t him, under the di&s;gui&s;e of &s;acred friend&s;hip and regard, would have given the intere&s;t and character of &s;ir Thomas &s;uch a blow, as he could not ea&s;ily have recovered, nor conveni|ently born. It is not therefore to be wondered at, that he wi&s;hed for &s;ome expedient to conceal it from the eyes of the public.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e he had formed a &s;cheme, which all the know|lege he had of the delicacy of Harriet's affection for him, did not prevent his thinking practicable; (for the female who once falls from innocence, is held to be &s;unk into perpetual deba&s;ement) and that was, to provide a hu&s;band for her in the per&s;on of another. And for that hu&s;band he pitched on Camplin, with who&s;e charac|ter he was too well acquainted, to doubt the bringing him over to any ba&s;ene&s;s which danger did not attend, and a liberal reward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> follow&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="018007_0087_0FA45579EC0512D0">Camplin, who at this time was in great want of money, and had always an appetite for tho&s;e plea&s;ures which money alone can purcha&s;e, agreed to his propo&s;als; they &s;ettled the dowry of his future wife, and the &s;cheme which he undertook to procure her. Part of its execution I have already related; I proceed to relate the re&s;t.</P>
<P>When they had been driven with all the fury which Camplin had enjoined the po&s;tilions, for about eight or nine miles, they &s;topt at an inn, where they changed hor&s;es. Harriet expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e at their not having already reached the place where &s;ir Thomas waited them; on which Camplin told her, that it was not a great way off, but that the roads were very bad, and that he ob&s;erved the hor&s;es to be exceedingly jaded.</P>
<P>After having proceeded &s;ome miles farther, on a road &s;till more wild and le&s;s frequented, &s;he repeated her wonder at the length of the way; on which Camplin, entreating her pardon for being concerned in any how deceiving her, confe&s;&s;ed that &s;ir Thomas was at a place much farther from her father's than he had made her believe; which deceit he had begged of him (Camplin) to practi&s;e, that &s;he might not be alarmed at the di&s;tance, which was nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;aid, for that plan of &s;ecrecy &s;ir Thomas had formed for his marriage. Her fears were &s;ufficiently rou&s;ed at this intelli|gence, but it was now too late to retreat, however terrible it might be to go on.</P>
<P>Some time after they &s;topt to breakfa&s;t, and changed hor&s;es a|gain, Camplin informing her, that it was the la&s;t time they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to do &s;o. Accordingly, in little more than an hour, during which the &s;peed of their progre&s;s was nowi&s;e abated, they halted at the door of a hou&s;e, which Harriet, upon coming out of the chai&s;e, immediately recollected to be that fatal one to which Sindall had before conveyed her. She felt, on entering it, a de|gree of horror which the remembrance of that guilty night &s;he had before pa&s;&s;ed under its roof, could not fail to &s;ugge&s;t, and it was with difficulty &s;he dragged her trembling &s;teps to a room above &s;tairs, whither the landlady, with a profu&s;ion of civility, conduct|ed her.</P>
<P>Where is &s;ir Thomas Sindall? &s;aid &s;he, looking about with terror on the well-remembered objects around her. Camplin, &s;hutting the door of the chamber, told her, with a look of the ut|mo&s;t tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect, that &s;ir Thomas was not then in the hou&s;e, but had de&s;ired him to deliver her a letter, which he now put into her hands for her peru&s;al. It contained what follows:
<LETTER>
<P>It is with inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h I inform my ever-deare&s;t Harriet, of my inability to perform engagements, of which I acknowlege the &s;olemnity, and which nece&s;&s;ity alone has power to cancel.

With this view I have laid a&s;ide all &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations &s;o much, as to yield to the &s;uit of Mr. Camplin that hand, which I had once the happine&s;s of expecting for my&s;elf.

</LETTER></P>
<P>Camplin was about to offer his commentary upon this letter; but Harriet, who&s;e &s;pirits had ju&s;t &s;upported her to the end of it, lay now lifele&s;s at his feet. After &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive faintings, from which Camplin, the landlady, and other a&s;&s;i&s;tants, with difficulty recovered her, a &s;hower of tears came at la&s;t to her relief, and &s;he became able to articulate &s;ome &s;hort exclamations of horror and de&s;pair! Camplin threw him&s;elf on his knees before her. He pro|te&s;ted the mo&s;t &s;incere and di&s;intere&s;ted pa&s;&s;ion; and that, if &s;he would ble&s;s him with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o many amiable qualities as &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the uniform endeavour of his life &s;hould be to pro|mote her happine&s;s. &mdash; "I think not of thee," &s;he exclaimed; "Oh! Sindall! per&s;idious, cruel, deliberate villain!" Camplin again interrupted her, with prote&s;tations of his own affection and regard.</P>
<P>"Away! &s;aid &s;he, and let me hear no more! Or, if thou would&s;t &s;how thy friend&s;hip, carry me to that father from whom thou did&s;t &s;teal me.&mdash;You will not&mdash;but if I can live &s;o long, I will crawl to his feet, and expire before him." She was running to|wards the door; Camplin gently &s;topt her.</P>
<P>"My deare&s;t Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, &s;aid he, recollect your&s;elf but a moment; let me conjure you to think of your own welfare, and of that father's whom you &s;o ju&s;tly love. For the&s;e alone could &s;ir Thomas Sindall have thought of the expedient which he propo&s;es. If you will now become the wife of your adoring Camplin, the time of the celebration of our marriage need not be told to the world: under the &s;anction of that holy tie, every circum&s;tance of detraction will be overlooked, and that life may be made long and happy, which your unthinking ra&s;hne&s;s would cut off from your|&s;elf and your father."&mdash;</P>
<P>Harriet had li&s;tened little to this &s;peech; but the &s;welling of her anger had &s;ub&s;ided; &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair, and bur&s;t again into tears. Camplin drew nearer, and pre&s;&s;ed her hand in his; &s;he drew it ha&s;tily from him: "If you have any pity, &s;he
<PB N="42" REF="018007_0089_0FA4557BCE9B74C8">
cried, I entreat you for heaven's &s;ake to leave me." He bowed re&s;pect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lly and retired, de&s;iring the landlady to attend Mi&s;s An|ne&s;ly, and endeavour to afford her &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance and con&s;olation.</P>
<P>She had, indeed, more occa&s;ion for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance than he was than aware of; the violent agitation of her &s;pirits having had &s;uch an effect on her, that, though &s;he wanted a month of her time, &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with the pains of child-birth; and they were but ju&s;t able to procure a woman who acted as a mid|wife in the neighbourhood, when &s;he was delivered of a girl. Di&s;|tracted as her &s;oul was, this new object drew forth its in&s;tinctive tenderne&s;s; &s;he mingled tears with her ki&s;&s;es on its cheeks, and forgot the &s;hame attending its birth, in the natural meltings of a mother.</P>
<P>For about a week after her delivery &s;he recovered tolerably well, and indeed tho&s;e about her &s;pared no pains or attention to contri|bute towards her recovery; but, at the end of that period, an ac|cident threw her into the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ituation. She was lying in a &s;lumber, with a nur&s;e watching her, when a &s;ervant of &s;ir Tho|mas Sindall's, whom his ma&s;ter had employed very actively in the progre&s;s of his de&s;igns on Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly, entered the room with a look of the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation and horror; the nur&s;e beckoned to him to make no noi&s;e, &s;ignifying, by her ge&s;tures, that the lady was a&s;leep; but the opening of the door had already awakened her, and &s;he lay li&s;tening, when he told the cau&s;e of his emotion. It was the intelligence which he had ju&s;t accidentally received of Mr. Anne&s;ly's death. The effect of this &s;hock on his unfortunate daughter may be ea&s;ily imagined; every fatal &s;ymptom, which &s;udden terror or &s;urpri&s;e cau&s;es in women at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on of weak|ne&s;s, was the con&s;equence, and next morning a delirium &s;ucceed|ed them.</P>
<P>She was not, however, without intervals of rea&s;on; though the&s;e were but intervals of angui&s;h much more exqui&s;ite. Yet &s;he would &s;ometimes expre&s;s a &s;ort of calmne&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of heaven, though it was always attended with the hopes of a &s;peedy relief from the calamities of her exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e hours of recollection, &s;he was a&s;ked by her at|tendants, who&s;e pity was now moved at her condition, if &s;he cho&s;e to have any friend &s;ent for, who might tend to alleviate her di&s;|tre&s;s; upon which &s;he had command enough of her&s;elf, to dictate a letter to Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, reciting briefly the mi&s;eries &s;he had en|dured, and a&s;king, with great diffidence however of obtaining, if &s;he could pardon her offences &s;o far, as to come and receive the parting breath of her once innocent and much loved Harriet. This letter was accordingly di&s;patched; and &s;he &s;eemed to feel a relief from having accompli&s;hed it: but her rea&s;on had held out beyond its u&s;ual limits of exertion; and immediately after, &s;he relap&s;ed into her former unconnectedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after the birth of her daughter, Camplin, according to his in&s;tructions, had propo&s;ed &s;ending it away, under the charge of a
<PB N="43" REF="018007_0090_0FA4557F45CB3B08">
nur&s;e whom the landlady had procured, to a &s;mall hamlet, where &s;he re&s;ided, at a little di&s;tance. But this the mother oppo&s;ed with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s, that the purpo&s;e had been delayed till now, when it was given up to the care of this woman, accompanied with a con&s;iderable &s;um of money to provide every nece&s;&s;ary for its u&s;e, in the mo&s;t ample and &s;umptuous manner.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Wi&s;tanly received the letter we have mentioned a|bove, &s;he was not long in doubt as to complying with its reque&s;t. Her heart bled for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of that once amiable friend, whom virtue might now blame, but goodne&s;s could not for&s;ake. She &s;et out therefore immediately in a chai&s;e, which Camplin had provided for her, and reached the hou&s;e, to which it conveyed her on the morning of the following day, her impatience not &s;uffering her to con&s;ider either the danger or inconvenience of travelling all night. &mdash; From her recital, I took down the account contained in the following chapter.</P>

<DIV2 N="30" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's recital. Conclu&s;ion of the &s;econd volume.</HEAD>
<P>"WHEN I entered the hou&s;e, and had got upon the &s;tairs leading to the room in which Harriet lay, I heard a voice enchantingly &s;weet, but low, and &s;ometimes broken, &s;inging &s;natches of &s;ongs, varying from the &s;ad to the gay, and from the gay to the &s;ad: it was &s;he her&s;elf &s;itting up in her bed, fingering her pillow as if it had been a harp&s;icord. It is not ea&s;y to conceive the horror I felt on &s;eeing her in &s;uch a &s;ituation! She &s;eemed un|con&s;cious of my approach, though her eye was turned towards me as I entered; only that &s;he &s;topt in the mid&s;t of a quick and live|ly movement &s;he had begun, and looking wi&s;tfully upon me, breathed &s;uch a note of &s;orrow, and dwelt on it with a cadence &s;o mournful, that my heart lo&s;t all the firmne&s;s I had re&s;olved to pre|&s;erve, and I flung my arms round her neck, which I wa&s;hed with my bur&s;ting tears!&mdash;</P>
<P>The traces which her brain could now only recollect, were &s;uch as did not admit of any object long; I had pa&s;&s;ed over it in the moment of my entrance, and it now wandered from the idea; &s;he paid no regard to my care&s;&s;es, but pu&s;hed me gently from her, gazing &s;tedfa&s;tly in an oppo&s;ite direction towards the door of the apartment.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant entered with &s;ome medicine he had been &s;ent to pro|cure; &s;he put it by when I offered it to her, and kept looking earne&s;tly upon him; &s;he cea&s;ed her &s;inging too, and &s;eemed to articulate certain imperfect &s;ounds. For &s;ome time I could not make them out into words, but at la&s;t &s;he &s;poke more di&s;tinctly, and with a firmer tone.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="018007_0091_0FA4557FED98AB20">
<Q>You &s;aved my life once, &s;ir, and I could then thank you, becau&s;e I wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve it;&mdash;but now&mdash; no matter, he is happier than I would have him.&mdash; I would have nur&s;ed the poor old man till he had &s;een &s;ome better days! ble&s;s his white beard!&mdash;look there! I have heard how they grow in the grave! &mdash;poor old man!&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>You weep, my dear &s;ir; but had you heard her &s;peak the&s;e words! I can but coldly repeat them.</P>
<P>All that day &s;he continued in a &s;tate of delirium and in&s;en&s;ibility to every object around her; towards evening &s;he &s;eemed exhau&s;ted with fatigue, and the to&s;&s;ing of her hands which her frenzy had cau&s;ed, grew languid as of one breathle&s;s and worn out; about midnight &s;he dropt a&s;leep.</P>
<P>I &s;at with her during the night, and when &s;he waked in the morning, &s;he gave &s;igns of having recovered her &s;en&s;es by recol|lecting me, and calling me by my name. At fir&s;t indeed her que&s;tions were irregular and wild; but in a &s;hort time &s;he grew &s;o di&s;tinct, as to thank me for having complied with the reque&s;t of her letter;
<Q>'tis an office of unmerited kindne&s;s, which, &s;aid &s;he, (and I could ob&s;erve her let fall a tear) will be the la&s;t your unwearied friend&s;hip for me will have to be&s;tow.</Q>
I an&s;wered, that I hoped not.
<Q>Ah! Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, &s;he replied, can you hope &s;o? you are not my friend, if you do.</Q>
I wi&s;hed to avoid a &s;ubject which her mind was little able to bear, and there|fore made no other return than by ki&s;&s;ing her hand, which &s;he had &s;tretched out to me as &s;he &s;poke.</P>
<P>At that moment we heard &s;ome unu&s;ual &s;tir below &s;tairs, and, as the floor was thin and ill &s;aid, the word <HI>child</HI> was very di&s;tinctly audible from every tongue. Upon this &s;he &s;tarted up in her bed, and with a look piteous and wild beyond de&s;cription, exclaimed "Oh! my God! what of my child?"&mdash;She had &s;carcely uttered the words, when the landlady entered the room, and &s;howed &s;ufficiently by her countenance that &s;he had &s;ome dreadful tale to tell.</P>
<P>By &s;igns I begged her to be &s;ilent.&mdash;
<Q>What is become of my infant?</Q>
cried Harriet.&mdash;
<Q>No ill, madam, (an&s;wered the woman, faltering) is come to it, I hope.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>Speak, &s;aid &s;he, I charge you, for I will know the wor&s;t: &s;peak, as you would give peace to my departing &s;oul!</Q>
&s;pringing out of bed, and gra&s;ping the woman's hands with all her force.&mdash;It was not ea&s;y to re&s;i&s;t &s;o &s;olemn a charge.&mdash;
<Q>Alas! &s;aid the landlady, I fear &s;he is drowned; for the nur&s;e's cloak and the child's wrapper have been found in &s;ome ooze which the river had carried down below the ford.</Q>
&mdash;She let go the woman's hands, and wringing her own together, threw up her eyes to heaven till their &s;ight was lo&s;t in the &s;ockets.&mdash;We were &s;upporting her, each of us holding one of her arms. &mdash;She fell on her knees between us, and dropping her hands for a moment, then rai&s;ing them again, uttered with a voice that &s;ounded hollow as if &s;unk within her.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="018007_0092_0FA45581CDB99490">
<Q>Power omnipotent! who wilt not lay on thy creature cala|mity beyond their &s;trength to bear! if thou ha&s;t not yet puni&s;h|ed me enough, continue to pour out the phials of thy wrath upon me, and enable me to &s;upport what thou inflicte&s;t! But if my faults are expiated, &s;uffer me to re&s;t in peace, and gra|ciou&s;ly blot out the offences which thy judgments have puni&s;hed here!</Q>
&mdash;She continued in the &s;ame po&s;ture for a few moments; then leaning on us as if &s;he meant to ri&s;e, bent her head forward; and drawing her breath &s;trongly, expired in our arms."</P>
<P>Such was the conclu&s;ion of Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's tale of woe!</P>
<P>Spirits of gentlene&s;s and peace! who look, with &s;uch pity as angels feel, on the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of mortality! often have ye &s;een me labouring under the afflictions which providence had laid upon me.&mdash;Ye have &s;een me in a &s;trange land, without friend, and with|out comforter, poor, &s;ick, and naked; ye have &s;een me &s;hivering over the la&s;t faggot which my la&s;t farthing had purcha&s;ed, moi&s;ten|ing the cru&s;t that &s;upported nature with the tears which her mi&s;eries &s;hed on it! yet have ye &s;een me look inward with a &s;mile, and overcome them.&mdash;If &s;uch &s;hall ever be my lot again, &s;o let me alle|viate its &s;orrows; let me creep to my bed of &s;traw in peace, after ble&s;&s;ing God that I am a Man of the World.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION, TO THE THIRD VOLUME, OF THE MAN OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born to a life of wandering, yet my heart was ever at home! though the country that gave me birth gave me but few friends, and of tho&s;e few the greate&s;t part were early lo&s;t, yet the remembrance of her was pre&s;ent with me in every clime to which my fate conducted me; and the idea of tho&s;e, who&s;e a&s;hes repo&s;ed in that humble &s;pot, where they had often been the com|panions of my infant &s;ports, hallowed it in my imagination with a &s;ort of &s;acred enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>I had not been many weeks an inhabitant of my native village, after that vi&s;it to the lady mentioned in the fir&s;t volume, which procured me the information I have there laid before my readers, till I found my&s;elf once more obliged to quit it for a foreign coun|try. My parting with Mrs. Wit&s;tanly was more &s;olemn and affect|ing than common &s;ouls will ea&s;ily imagine it could have been, up|on an acquaintance accidental in its beginning, and &s;hort in its duration; but there was &s;omething tender and melancholy in the cau&s;e of it, which gave an impre&s;&s;ion to our thoughts of one an|other, more &s;ympathetic perhaps than what a &s;eries of mutual ob|ligations could have effected.</P>
<P>Before we parted, I could not help a&s;king the rea&s;on of her &s;e|crecy with regard to the &s;tory of Anne&s;ly and his daughter. In an&s;wer to this &s;he informed me, that be&s;ides the danger to which &s;he expo&s;ed her&s;elf by &s;etting up in oppo&s;ition to a man, in the mid&s;t of who&s;e dependants &s;he propo&s;ed ending her days, &s;he was doubtful if her &s;tory would be of any &s;ervice to the memory of her friend: That Camplin (as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed by the direction of &s;ir Thomas Sindall, who was at that time abroad) had univer&s;ally given out, that Mi&s;s Anne&s;ly's elopement was with an intention to be married to him; on which footing, though a fal&s;e one, the character of that young lady &s;tood no wor&s;e, than if the truth were
<PB N="47" REF="018007_0094_0FA45583B84F8318">
divulged to tho&s;e, mo&s;t of whom wanted di&s;cernment, as well as candor, to make the di&s;tinctions which &s;hould enable them to do it ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Several years elap&s;ed before I returned to that place, whence, it is probable, I &s;hall migrate no more. My friend Mrs. Wi&s;tanly was one of the per&s;ons after whom I fir&s;t enquired on my arrival. I found her &s;ubject to the common debility, but not to any of the acuter di&s;tre&s;&s;es of age; with the &s;ame powers of rea&s;on, and the &s;ame complacency of temper, I had &s;een her before enjoy. "The&s;e &s;aid &s;he, are the effects of temperance without au&s;terity, and ea&s;e without indolence; I have nothing now to do but to live without the &s;olicitude of life, and to die without the fear of dying."</P>
<P>At one of our fir&s;t interviews, I found her accompanied by a young lady, who, be&s;ides a great &s;hare of what is univer&s;ally allowed the name of beauty, had &s;omething in her appearance which calls forth the e&s;teem of its beholders, without their pau&s;|ing to account for it. It has &s;ometimes deceived me, yet I am re&s;olved to tru&s;t it to the la&s;t hour of my life; at that time I gave it unlimited confidence, and I had &s;poken the young lady's eulo|gium before I had looked five minutes in her face.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wi&s;tanly repeated it to me after &s;he was gone. "That is one of my children, &s;aid &s;he, for I adopt the children of virtue; and &s;he calls me her mother, becau&s;e I am old and &s;he can cheri&s;h me."&mdash;"I could have &s;worn to her goodne&s;s, I replied, without any information be&s;ides what her countenance afforded me." &mdash; "'Tis a lovely one, &s;aid &s;he, and her mind is not flattered in its portrait: though &s;he is a member of a family with with whom I have not much intercou&s;e, yet &s;he is a frequent vi&s;iter at my little dwelling; her name is Sindall."&mdash;"Sindall!" I exclaimed.</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;aid Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, but &s;he is not therefore the le&s;s amiable. Sir Thomas returned from abroad &s;oon after you left this place; but for &s;everal years he did not re&s;ide here, having made a purcha&s;e of another e&s;tate in a neighbouring county, and bu&s;ied him&s;elf, during that time, in &s;uperintending the improve|ment of it.</P>
<P>When he returned hither, he brought this young lady, then a child, along with him, who, it &s;eems, was left to his care by her father, a friend of &s;ir Thomas's, who died abroad; and &s;he has lived with his aunt, who keeps hou&s;e for him, ever &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>The mention of &s;ir Thomas Sindall, naturally recalled to my mind the fate of the worthy, but unfortunate, Anne&s;ly. Mrs. Wi&s;tanly told me, &s;he had often been anxious in her enquiries about his &s;on William, the only remaining branch or her friend's family; but that neither &s;he, nor Mr. Rawlin&s;on, with whom &s;he had corre&s;ponded on the &s;ubject, had been able to procure any ac|counts of him; whence they concluded, that he had died in the plantation to which he was tran&s;ported in pur&s;uance of his miti|gated &s;entence.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="018007_0095_0FA4558470168430">She farther informed me, "that Sindall had &s;hown &s;ome marks of contrition at the tragical i&s;&s;ue of the &s;cheme he had carried on again&s;t the daughter's innocence and the father's peace; and to make &s;ome &s;mall atonement to the dead for the injuries he had done to the living, had cau&s;ed a monument to be erected over their graves, in the village church-yard, with an in&s;cription, &s;etting forth the piety of Anne&s;ly, and the virtues and beauty of Harriet. But whatever he might have felt at the time, continued &s;he, I fear the impre&s;&s;ion was not la&s;ting."</P>
<P>From the following chapters, containing &s;ome farther particulars of that gentleman's life, which my re&s;idence in his neighbourhood, and my acquaintance with &s;ome of the per&s;ons immediately con|cerned in them, gave me an opportunity of learning, my readers will judge if Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's conclu&s;ion was a ju&s;t one.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Some account of the per&s;ons of whom &s;ir Thomas Sindall's family con&s;i&s;ted.</HEAD>
<P>THE baronet's family con&s;i&s;ted, at this time, of his aunt, and the young lady mentioned in the Introduction, together with a cou&s;in of his, of the name of Bolton, who was con&s;idered as pre&s;umptive heir of the Sindall-e&s;tate, and who&s;e education had been &s;uperintended by &s;ir Thomas.</P>
<P>This young gentleman had lately returned from the univer&s;ity, to which his kin&s;man had &s;ent him. The expectations of his ac|quaintance were, as is u&s;ually the ca&s;e, &s;anguine in his favour; and, what is &s;omething le&s;s u&s;ual, they were not di&s;appointed. Be&s;ide the &s;tock of learning which his &s;tudies had acquired him, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an elegance of manner, and a winning &s;oftne&s;s of de|portment, which a college-life does not often be&s;tow, but proceed|ed in him, from a cau&s;e the lea&s;t variable of any, a di&s;po&s;ition in|&s;tinctively benevolent, and an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of heart.</P>
<P>With all his virtues, however, he was a dependant on &s;ir Tho|mas Sindall; and their exerci&s;e could only be indulged &s;o far as his cou&s;in gave them leave. Bolton's father who had married a daughter of the Sindall-family, had a con&s;iderable patrimony left him by a parent, who had acquired it in the &s;ure and common cour&s;e of mercantile application.</P>
<P>With this, and the dowry he received with his wife, he might have lived up to the limits of his utmo&s;t wi&s;h, if he had confined his wi&s;hes to what are commonly con&s;idered the ble&s;&s;ings of life; but, though he was not extravagant to &s;pend, he was ruined by an avidity to gain.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he was of that order of men, who are known by the name of projectors; and wa&s;ted the means of pre&s;ent enjoyment, in the pur&s;uit of luxury to come. To him&s;elf indeed the lo&s;s was but &s;mall; while his &s;ub&s;tance was moldering away by degrees, its
<PB N="4" REF="018007_0098_0FA45586ABFFFA20">
value was annihilated in his expectations of the future; and he died amid&s;t the horrors of a pri&s;on, &s;miling at the pro&s;pect of ideal wealth, and vi&s;ionary grandeur.</P>
<P>But with his family it was otherwi&s;e: his wife, who had often vainly endeavoured to prevent, by her advice, the de&s;tructive &s;chemes of her hu&s;band, at la&s;t tamely yielded to her fate, and died &s;oon after him of a broken heart, leaving an only &s;on, the Bolton who is now introduced into my &s;tory.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his father had been always ridiculed by &s;ir Thomas Sindall, as proceeding from a degree of whim and mad|ne&s;s, which it would have been a weakne&s;s to pity; his aunt, Mrs. Selwyn, joined in the &s;entiment; perhaps it was really her own; but at any rate &s;he was apt to agree in opinion with her nephew &s;ir Thomas, and never had much regard for her &s;i&s;ter Bolton, for &s;ome rea&s;ons no le&s;s ju&s;t than common: in the fir&s;t place her &s;i&s;ter was hand&s;omer than &s;he; &s;econdly, &s;he was &s;ooner married; and thirdly, &s;he had been ble&s;t with this promi&s;ing boy, while Mrs. Selwyn became a widow, without having had a child. There ap|peared then but little pro&s;pect of protection to poor Bolton from this quarter; but, as he had no other relation in any degree of propinquity, a regard to decency prompted the baronet to admit the boy into his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>His &s;ituation indeed was none of the mo&s;t agreeable; but the happy di&s;po&s;itions which nature had given him, &s;uited them&s;elves to the har&s;hne&s;s of his fortune; and in whatever &s;ociety he was placed, he found him&s;elf &s;urrounded with friends: there was not a &s;ervant in the hou&s;e, who would not ri&s;k the di&s;plea&s;ure of their ma&s;ter or Mrs. Selwyn, to do &s;ome forbidden act of kindne&s;s to their little favourite Harry Bolton.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas him&s;elf, from &s;ome concurring accidents, had his notice attracted by the good qualities of the boy; his indifference was conquered by degrees, and at la&s;t he began to take upon him|&s;elf the charge of rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing him to manhood. There wanted only this to fix his attachment: benefits to tho&s;e, whom we &s;et apart for our own management and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, have &s;omething &s;o parti|cular in their nature, that there is &s;carce a &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion which their exerci&s;e does not gratify. Yet I mean not to rob Sindall of the honour of his beneficence; it &s;hall no more want my prai&s;e, than it did the gratitude of Bolton.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Some farther particulars of the per&s;ons mentioned in the foregoing chapter.</HEAD>
<P>BOLTON, however, felt that unea&s;ine&s;s which will ever pre&s;s upon an ingenuous mind along with the idea of de|pendance: he had therefore frequently hinted, though in terms of the utmo&s;t mode&s;ty, a de&s;ire to be put into &s;ome way of life, that might give him an opportunity of launching forth into the world, and freeing his cou&s;in from the incumbrance of a u&s;ele&s;s idler in his family.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas had often made promi&s;es of indulging &s;o laudable a de&s;ire; but day after day elap&s;ed without his putting any of them in execution: the truth was, that he had contracted a &s;ort of pater|nal affection for Bolton, and found it a difficult matter to bring him&s;elf to the re&s;olution of parting with him.</P>
<P>He contented him&s;elf with employing the young man's genius and activity in the direction and &s;uperintendance of his country-affairs; he con&s;ulted him on plans for improving his e&s;tate, and entru&s;ted him with the care of their execution: he a&s;&s;ociated him with him&s;elf in matters of difficult di&s;cu&s;&s;ion as a magi&s;trate; and, in the &s;ports of the field, he was his con&s;tant companion.</P>
<P>It was a long time before Mrs. Selwyn, from &s;ome of the rea&s;ons I have hinted, could look on Harry with a favourable eye. When &s;ir Thomas fir&s;t began to take notice of him, &s;he remon&s;trated the danger of &s;poiling boys by indulgence, and endeavoured to coun|terbalance the e&s;timation of his good qualities, by the recital of little tales which &s;he now and then picked up again&s;t him.</P>
<P>It was not till &s;ome time after his return from the univer&s;ity, that Harry began to gain ground in the lady's e&s;teem. That at|tachment and deference to the &s;ofter &s;ex, which, at a certain age, is habitual to ours, is reckoned effeminacy among&s;t boys, and fixes a &s;tain upon their manhood. Before he went to the univer&s;i|ty, Harry was under this predicament; but, by the time of his return, he had attained the period of refinement, and &s;howed his aunt all tho&s;e trifling civilities, which it is the prerogative of the ladies to receive, and which Mrs. Selwyn was often more ready to demand than &s;ome males of her acquaintance were to pay.</P>
<P>In truth, it required a knowlege of many feminine qualities, which this lady doubtle&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to impre&s;s the mind with an idea of that courte&s;y which is due to the &s;ex; for her countenance was not expre&s;&s;ive of much &s;oftne&s;s, the natural &s;trength of her fea|tures being commonly heightened by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;nuff, and her conver&s;ation generally turning on points of controver&s;y in religion and philo&s;ophy, which, requiring an inten&s;e exertion of thought, are therefore, I pre&s;ume, from the practice of the fair in general, no way favourable to the pre&s;ervation or the improvement of beauty.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018007_0100_0FA4558840A709B8">It was, perhaps, from this very inclination for inve&s;tigating truth, that Bolton drew an advantage in his approaches towards her e&s;teem. As he was ju&s;t returned from the &s;eat of learning, where di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of that fort are common, &s;he naturally applied to him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in her re&s;earches&punc; by a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I mean oppo&s;i|tion; it being the quality of that de&s;ire after knowlege with which this lady was endued, to delight in nothing &s;o much, as in having its own doctrines confronted with oppo&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ones, till they pommel, and bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bour one another without mercy; the conte&s;t having one advantage peculiar to battles of this kind, that each party, far from being weakened by its exertion, commonly appears to have gained &s;trength, as well as honour, from the rencounter.</P>
<P>Bolton indeed did not po&s;&s;e&s;s quite &s;o much of this quality as his antagoni&s;t: he could not, in common good-breeding, refu&s;e her challenge; but he often maintained the conflict in a manner rather da&s;tardly for a philo&s;opher. He gave, however, full audience to the lady's arguments; and if he &s;ometimes &s;howed an unwilling|ne&s;s to reply, &s;he con&s;idered it as a te&s;timony of her power to &s;ilence. But &s;he was generous in her victories: whenever &s;he conceived them completely obtained, &s;he celebrated the prowe&s;s of her adver&s;ary, and allowed him all that wi&s;dom which retreats from the fortre&s;s it cannot defend.</P>
<P>There was, perhaps, another rea&s;on, as forcible as that of obliging Mrs. Selwyn, or attaining the recondite principles of philo&s;ophy, which increa&s;ed Bolton's willingne&s;s to indulge that lady in becoming a party to her di&s;qui&s;itions. There was a &s;pectatre&s;s of the combat, who&s;e company might have been pur|cha&s;ed at the expence of &s;itting to hear Aquinas him&s;elf di&s;pute upon theology&mdash;Mi&s;s Lucy Sindall. My readers have been ac|quainted, in the Introduction, with my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in her favour, and the character Mrs. Wi&s;tanly gave in ju&s;tification of it. They were deceived by neither.</P>
<P>With remarkable quickne&s;s of parts, and the livelie&s;t temper, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all that tenderne&s;s which is the chief ornament of the female character; and, with a mode&s;ty that &s;eemed to &s;hrink from ob&s;ervation, &s;he united an ea&s;e, and a dignity, that univer&s;ally com|manded it. Her vivacity only ro&s;e to be amiable; no enemy could ever repeat her wit, and &s;he had no friend who did not boa&s;t of her good-humour.</P>
<P>I &s;hould fir&s;t have de&s;cribed her per&s;on; my readers will excu&s;e it; it is not of &s;uch minds that I am mo&s;t &s;olicitous to ob&s;erve the dw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llings: I have hinted before, and I repeat it, that hers was &s;uch a one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as no mind need be a&s;hamed of</P>
<P>Such was the attendant of Mrs. Selwyn, who&s;e company the good lady particularly required at tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, when &s;he unveil|ed her knowlege in argument, or pointed her &s;agacity to in&s;truc|tion. She would often employ Bolton and Mi&s;s Lucy to read her certain &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages of books, when a weakne&s;s in her own &s;ight made reading unea&s;y to her; the &s;ubjects were rarely of the enter|taining
<PB N="7" REF="018007_0101_0FA45589DDE32750">
kind, yet Harry never complained of their length. This &s;he attributed to his opinion of their u&s;efulne&s;s; Lucy called it good-nature; he thought &s;o him&s;elf at fir&s;t; but he &s;oon began to di&s;cover that it proceeded from &s;ome different cau&s;e; for when Mi&s;s Lucy was, by any accident, away, he read with very little complacency. He never &s;u&s;pected it to be love; much le&s;s did Lucy: they owned each other for friends; and when Mrs. Selwyn u&s;ed to call them children, Bolton would call Lucy &s;i&s;ter; yet he was often not di&s;plea&s;ed to remember, that &s;he was not his &s;i&s;ter indeed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A natural con&s;equence of &s;ome particulars con|tained in the la&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tate of the mind may be often di&s;gui&s;ed, even from the owner, when he means to enquire into it; but a very trifle will throw it from its guard, and betray its &s;ituation, when a for|mal examination has failed to di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>Bolton would often catch him&s;elf &s;ighing when Mi&s;s Sindall was ab&s;ent, and feel his cheeks glow at her approach; he wondered what it was that made him &s;igh and blu&s;h.</P>
<P>He would &s;ometimes take &s;olitary walks, without knowing why he wandered out alone: he found &s;omething that plea&s;ed him, in the melancholy of lonely rece&s;&s;es, and half-worn paths, and his day-dreams commonly ended in &s;ome idea of Mi&s;s Sindall, though he meant nothing le&s;s than to think of &s;uch an object.</P>
<P>He had &s;trayed in one of tho&s;e excur&s;ions, about half a mile from the hou&s;e, through a cop&s;e at the corner of the park, which opened into a little green amp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itheatre, in the middle of which was a pool of water, formed by a rivulet that crept through the matted gra&s;s, till it fell into this ba&s;on by a gentle ca&s;cade.</P>
<P>The &s;un was gleaming through the trees, which were pictured on the &s;urface of the pool beneath; and the &s;ilence of the &s;cene was only interrupted by the murmurs of the water fall, &s;ometimes accompanied by the querulous note of the wood pigeons, who in|habited the neighbouring cop&s;e.</P>
<P>Bolton &s;eated him&s;elf on the bank, and li&s;tened to their dirge. It cea&s;ed; for he had di&s;turbed the &s;acred, &s;olitary haunt. "I will give you &s;ome mu&s;ic in return," &s;aid he, and drew from his pocket a &s;mall-piped flute, which he frequently carried with him in his evening-walks, and &s;erenaded the lonely &s;hepherd returning from his fold.</P>
<P>He played a little plaintive air, which him&s;elf had compo&s;ed; he thought he had played it by chance; but Mi&s;s Sindall had com|mended it the day before: the recollection of Mi&s;s Sindall accom|panied the &s;ound, and he had drawn her portrait li&s;tening to its clo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="018007_0102_0FA4558A6B42BCD0">She was indeed li&s;tening to its clo&s;e; for accident had pointed her walk in the very &s;ame direction with Bolton's. She was ju&s;t coming out of the wood, when &s;he heard the &s;oft notes of his flute; they had &s;omething of fairy-mu&s;ic in them, that &s;uited the &s;cene, and &s;he was irre&s;i&s;tibly drawn nearer the place where he &s;at, though &s;ome wayward feeling aro&s;e, and whi&s;pered, that &s;he &s;hould not approach it. Her feet were approaching it whether &s;he would or no; and &s;he &s;tood clo&s;e by his &s;ide, while the la&s;t cadence was melting from his pipe.</P>
<P>She repeated it after him with her voice. "Mi&s;s Sindall!" cried he, &s;tarting up with &s;ome emotion. "I know, &s;aid &s;he, you will be &s;urpri&s;ed to find me here; but I was enchanted hither by the &s;ound of your flute. Pray touch that little melancholy tune again." He began, but he played very ill. "You blow it, &s;aid &s;he, not &s;o &s;weetly as before; let me try what tone I can give it."&mdash;She put it to her mouth, but &s;he wanted the &s;kill to give it voice. &mdash;"There cannot be much art in it," &mdash;&s;he tried it again &mdash;"and yet it will not &s;peak at my bidding."&mdash;She looked &s;tedfa&s;tly on the flute, holding her fingers on the &s;tops; her lips were red from the pre&s;&s;ure, and her figure altogether &s;o pa&s;toral and innocent, that, I do not believe, the ki&s;&s;es, with which the poets make Diana greet her &s;i&s;ter hun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;&s;es, were ever more cha&s;te than that, which Bolton now &s;tole from her by &s;urprize.</P>
<P>Her cheeks were crim&s;on at this little violence of Harry's. "What do you mean, Mr. Bolton?" &s;aid &s;he, dropping the flute to the ground. "'Twas a forfeiture," he replied, &s;tammering, and blu&s;hing exce&s;&s;ively, "for attempting to blow my flute."&mdash; "I don't under&s;tand you," an&s;wered Lucy, and turned towards the hou&s;e, with &s;ome marks of re&s;entment on her countenance. Bolton was for &s;ome time rivetted to the &s;pot; when he recovered the u&s;e of his feet, he ran after Mi&s;s Sindall, and gently laying hold of her hand, "I cannot bear your anger, &s;aid he, though I own, your di&s;plea&s;ure is ju&s;t; but forgive, I intreat you, this un|thinking offence of him, who&s;e re&s;pect is equal to his love."&mdash;. "Your love, Mr. Bolton!"&mdash;"I cannot retract the word, though my heart has betrayed me from that prudence which might have &s;tifled the declaration.</P>
<P>I have not language, Mi&s;s Lucy, for the pre&s;ent feelings of my &s;oul; till this moment I never knew how much I loved you, and never could I have expre&s;&s;ed it &s;o ill."&mdash;He pau&s;ed&mdash;&s;he was look|ing fixedly on the ground, drawing her hand &s;oftly from his, which refu&s;ed involuntarily to quit its hold. &mdash;"May I not hope," &s;aid he &mdash; "You have my pardon, Mr. Bolton" &mdash; "But" &mdash; "I beg you," &s;aid Lucy, interrupting him, "to leave this &s;ubject; I know your merit, Mr. Bolton &mdash;my e&s;teem&mdash;you have thrown me into &s;uch confu&s;ion &mdash;nay, let go my hand."&mdash;"Pity then, and forgive me."&mdash;She &s;ighed&mdash;he pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips&mdash;&s;he blu&s;hed, &mdash;and blu&s;hed in &s;uch a manner&mdash;They have never been in Bolton's &s;ituation, by whom that &s;igh, and that blu&s;h, would not have been under&s;tood.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Bolton is &s;eparated from Mi&s;s Sindall.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was too much innocence in the brea&s;t of Lucy, to &s;uffer it to be furni&s;hed with di&s;gui&s;e. I mean not to throw any imputation on that female delicacy, Which, as Milton expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q><L>&mdash;would be woo'd, and not un&s;ought be won.</L></Q>
This, in truth, canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be call'd art, becau&s;e nature has given it to all her females. Let it &s;imply proceed from mode&s;ty, and it will never go too far; but the affectation of it is ever the con&s;e|quence of weakne&s;s in the head, or cruelty in the heart.</P>
<P>I believe Mi&s;s Sindall to have been &s;ubject to neither; &s;he did not therefore a&s;&s;ume the pride of indifference which &s;he did not feel, to the attachment of &s;o much worth as Bolton's, and he had &s;oon the happine&s;s to find, that his affection, which every day encrea&s;ed, was not lavi&s;hed without hope of a return.</P>
<P>But he did not &s;eem to be &s;o fortunate, meanwhile, in the e&s;timation of every per&s;on in the family: &s;ir Thomas Sindall had not of late &s;hown that cordiality towards Bolton, with which he had been wont to favour him. As Harry was incon&s;cious of any rea&s;on he could have given for it, this alteration in his cou&s;in's behaviour was, for &s;ome time, altogether unnoticed by him: and, when at la&s;t, he was forced to ob&s;erve it, he attributed it to no particular cau&s;e, but con&s;idered it as merely the effect of &s;ome accidental and temporary &s;hagreen: nor did he altogether change his opinion, even when Lucy &s;ugge&s;ted to him her fears on the &s;ubject, and entreated him to recollect, if he had, in any re&s;pect, di&s;obliged his cou&s;in, who&s;e behaviour &s;eemed to her to indicate &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t conceived particularly again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Not long after, the baronet informed his family of his intention of changing their place of re&s;idence, for &s;ome time, from Sindall park, to his other e&s;tate, where, he &s;aid, he found his pre&s;ence was become nece&s;&s;ary; and at the &s;ame time communicated to Bolton his de&s;ire, that he &s;hould remain behind, to &s;uperintend the execution of certain plans, which he had laid down with regard to the management of &s;ome country-bu&s;ine&s;s at the fir&s;t-mentioned place.</P>
<P>Harry thought this &s;ufficiently warranted his expre&s;&s;ing a &s;u&s;pi|cion, that his company had not, of late, been &s;o agreeable to &s;ir Thomas, as it u&s;ed to be, and begged to be informed in what par|ticular he had offended him. "Offended me! my dear boy, re|plied &s;ir Thomas; never in the lea&s;t. &mdash; From what &s;uch an idea could have ari&s;en, I know not; if from my leaving you here behind when we go to Bil&s;wood, it is the mo&s;t mi&s;taken one in the world:
<PB N="10" REF="018007_0104_0FA4558E132C5B10">
'tis but for a few months, till tho&s;e affairs I talked to you of are fini&s;hed; and I hope there to have opportunity of &s;howing, that, in your ab&s;ence, I &s;hall be far from forgetting you."</P>
<P>During the time of their &s;tay at Sindall-park, he behaved to Harry, in &s;o courteous and obliging a manner, that his &s;u&s;picions were totally removed; and he b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re with le&s;s regret, than he &s;hould otherwi&s;e have done, a &s;eparation from his Lucy, which he con&s;i|dered as temporary; be&s;ides that his &s;tay behind was nece&s;&s;ary to him, who&s;e countenance and friend&s;hip, his attachment to that young lady, had now rendered more valuable in his e&s;timation. Love encrea&s;es the li&s;t of our dependencies; I mean it not as an argument again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ion; that &s;ex, I tru&s;t, who&s;e power it e&s;tabli&s;hes, will point its va&s;&s;als, to no pur&s;uit, but what is lau|dable.</P>
<P>Their farewell &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed on that very &s;pot, which I have de|&s;cribed in the la&s;t chapter, as witne&s;s to the declaration of Bolton's pa&s;&s;ion. Their farewell &mdash;but where the feelings &s;ay much, and the expre&s;&s;ion little, de&s;cription will &s;eldom &s;ucceed in the picture.</P>
<P>Their &s;eparation, however, was alleviated by the hope that it was not likely to be of long continuance: &s;ir Thomas's declaration, of his intending that Harry &s;hould follow them in a few months, was not forgotten; and the intermediate days were &s;wallowed up, in the anticipation of the plea&s;ures, which that period &s;hould produce.</P>
<P>In the mean time, they took &s;omething from the pain of ab&s;ence by a punctual corre&s;pondence. The&s;e letters I have &s;een: they de&s;cribe things little in them&s;elves; to Bolton and Lucy they were no trifles; but by others their importance would not be under&s;tood. One recital only I have ventured to extract for the peru&s;al of the reader; becau&s;e I ob&s;erve, that it &s;trongly affected them, who, in this in&s;tance, were intere&s;ted no more than any, to whom the feel|ings it addre&s;&s;es are known; and &s;ome of my readers, probably, have the advantage of not being altogether unacquainted with the per&s;ons of whom it &s;peaks.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. An Adventure of Mi&s;s Sindall's at Bil&s;wood.</HEAD>
<P>TO a&s;&s;ume her &s;emblance, is a tribute which vice mu&s;t often pay to virtue. There are popular qualities which the world looks for, becau&s;e it is aware, that it may be &s;ometimes benefited by their exertion. Genero&s;ity is an excellence, by the apparent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which I have known many worthle&s;s characters buoy'd up from their infamy; though with them it was, indeed, but thoughtle&s;s profu&s;ion; and, on the other hand, I have &s;een ami|able men marked out with a &s;neer by the million, from a temper|ance or re&s;ervedne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which &s;huns the glare of public
<PB N="11" REF="018007_0105_0FA4558E43BD3AC8">
and the plea&s;ures of convivial life, and gives to mode&s;ty and gentle manners the appearance of par&s;imony and meanne&s;s of &s;pirit. The imputation of merit with mankind, Sindall knew to be a nece&s;&s;ary appendage to his character; he was careful therefore to omit no opportunity of &s;tepping forth to their notice as a man of gener|o&s;ity.</P>
<P>There was not a gentleman's &s;ervant in the county, who did not talk of the knight's munificence in the article of vails; and a park-keeper was thought a happy man, whom his ma&s;ter &s;ent with a hanch of veni&s;on to &s;ir Thomas. Once a year too he fea&s;ted his tenants, and indeed the whole neigbourhood, on the large lawn in the front of his hou&s;e, where the &s;trong beer ran ca&s;cade-wi&s;e from the mouth of a leaden triton.</P>
<P>But there were objects of compa&s;&s;ion, who&s;e relief would not have figured in the eye of the public, on whom he was not &s;o re|markable for be&s;towing his liberality. The beggars, he complain|ed, were perpetually &s;tealing his fruit, and de&s;troying his &s;hrub|bery: he therefore kept a wolf-dog to give them their an&s;wer at the gate; and &s;ome poor families in the village on his e&s;tate had been brought to beggary by pro&s;ecutions for poaching, an offence which every country-gentleman is bound, in honour, to puni&s;h with the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the law; and cannot therefore, without a breach of that honour, alleviate by a weak and ill judged exerci&s;e of benevolence.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Lucy, however, as &s;he could not &s;o &s;trongly feel the offence, would &s;ometimes contribute to le&s;&s;en the rigor of its puni&s;hment, by making &s;mall pre&s;ents to the wives and children of the delinquents. Pa&s;&s;ing, one evening, by the door of a cottage, where one of tho&s;e pen&s;ioners on her bounty lived, &s;he ob&s;erved, &s;tanding before it a very beautiful l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p-dog, with a collar and bell, ornamented much beyond the trappings of any animal that could belong to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>From this circum&s;tance her curio&s;ity was excited to enter, when &s;he was not a little &s;urprized to find a young lady in a mo&s;t elegant undre&s;s, &s;itting on a joint-&s;tool by the fire, with one of the children of the family on her lap. The ladies expre&s;&s;ed mutual a&s;toni&s;hment in their countenances at this meeting, when the good woman of the hou&s;e running up to them, and cla&s;ping a hand of each in her's, "Ble&s;&s;ings, &s;aid &s;he, thou&s;ands of ble&s;&s;ings on you both! a lovelier couple, or a better, my eyes never looked on."&mdash;The infant clapped its hands as if in&s;tinctively.&mdash;"Dear heart! continued its mother, look, if my Tommy be not thank|ing you too! well may he clap his hands, if it had not been for your gracious &s;elves, by this time his hands would have been cold clay! (mumbling his fingers in her mouth, and bathing his arms with her tears) when you &s;trictly forbad me to tell mortal of your favours, Oh! how I longed to to let each of you know, that there was another lady in the world as good as her&s;elf."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="018007_0106_0FA4558EECF212B0">The &s;tranger had now recovered her&s;elf enough to tell Mi&s;s Lucy, how much it delighted her to find, that a young lady, of her figure, did not di&s;dain to vi&s;it affliction even among&s;t the poor and the lowly. "That reflection, an&s;wered the other, applies more &s;trongly to the lady who makes it, than to her who is the occa&s;ion of its being made.</P>
<P>I have not, madam, the honour of your acquaintance; but methinks, pardon my boldne&s;s, that I feel as if we were not &s;trangers; at lea&s;t, I am &s;ure that I &s;hould reckon it a piece of &s;in|gular good fortune, if this interview could entitle me to call you &s;tranger no longer." Their landlady cried and laughed by turns; and her two gue&s;ts were &s;o much plea&s;ed with this meeting that they appointed a renewal of it, at an hour &s;omewhat earlier of the &s;ub&s;equent evening.</P>
<P>Lucy came a few minutes before the time of appointment; when &s;he learned that the &s;tranger was the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman, whom a difference of di&s;po&s;ition from that of &s;ir Tho|mas Sindall, ari&s;ing at la&s;t to a particular coolne&s;s, had entirely e&s;tranged for many years from the baronet; and prevented all in|tercour&s;e between the families.</P>
<P>When this lady arrived, &s;he brought &s;uch tidings along with her that I que&s;tion, if in all the &s;umptuous abodes of wealth and grandeur, there was to be found &s;o much &s;incerity of joy, as with|in the ragged and moldering walls of the hovel, which &s;he graced with her pre&s;ence. She informed the grateful mi&s;tre&s;s of it, that by her interce&s;&s;ion with &s;ome ju&s;tices of the peace, who made part of the judicature before whom the poor woman's hu&s;band was brought, his puni&s;hment had been mitigated to a &s;mall fine, which &s;he had undertaken to pay, and that he would very &s;oon be on his way homewards.</P>
<P>The joy of the poor man's family at this intelligence was &s;uch, as they could not, nor &s;hall I, attempt to expre&s;s. His deliverance was indeed unexpected, becau&s;e his crime was great; no le&s;s than that of having &s;et a gin in his garden, for &s;ome cats that u&s;ed to prey on a &s;ingle brood of chickens, his only property; which gin had, one night, wickedly and maliciou&s;ly, hanged a hare, which the baronet's game-keeper next morning di&s;covered in it. His wife and little ones &s;eemed only to be re&s;trained by the re&s;pect|ed pre&s;ence of their gue&s;ts, from running out to meet a hu&s;band and a father re&s;tored to them from captivity.</P>
<P>The ladies ob&s;erving it, encouraged them in the de&s;ign; and having received the good woman's benediction on her knees, they walked out together, and leaving the happy family on the road to the pri&s;on, turned down a winding romantic walk, that followed the mazes of a rill, in an oppo&s;ite direction.</P>
<P>Lucy, who&s;e eyes had been fixed with re&s;pectful attention on her fair companion, ever &s;ince her arrival at the cottage, now dropped a tear&punc; from each. "You will not wonder at the&s;e tears, madam, &s;aid &s;he, when you know that they are my common &s;ign of joy and
<PB N="13" REF="018007_0107_0FA4558FB0D6C6F0">
admiration; they thank you on behalf of my&s;elf and my &s;ex, who&s;e peculiar beauty con&s;i&s;ts in tho&s;e gentle virtues you &s;o emin|ently po&s;&s;e&s;s; my heart feels not only plea&s;ure, but pride, in an in&s;tance of female worth &s;o exalted.</P>
<P>Though the family in which I live, from &s;ome cau&s;e unknown to me, have not the happine&s;s of an intercou&s;e with yours, yet your name is familiar to my ear, and carries with it the idea of every amiable and engaging quality." "Nor am I, returned the other, a &s;tranger to the name, or the worth, of Mi&s;s Sindall; and I reckon my&s;elf &s;ingularly fortunate, not only to have acci|dentally made an acquaintance with her, but to have made it in that very &s;tile, which effectually &s;ecures the e&s;teem her character had formerly impre&s;&s;ed me with." "Beneficence indeed, replied Lucy, is a virtue of which the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion may entitle to an acquaint|ance with one, to whom that virtue is &s;o particularly known." "It is no le&s;s a plea&s;ure than a duty, rejoined her companion; but I, Mi&s;s Sindall, have an additional incitement to the exerci&s;e of it, which perhaps, as the tongue of curio&s;ity is at one time as bu&s;y as its ear is attentive at another, you may ere this have heard of. That ancient building to which the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k we are on, will, in a few minutes, conduct us, was formerly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one, in who&s;e bo&s;om re&s;ided every gentle excellence that adorns humani|ty; he, Mi&s;s Sindall,&mdash;why &s;hould I blu&s;h to tell it?&mdash;in the &s;or|did calculation of the world, his attachment was not enviable; the remembrance of it, though it wrings my heart with &s;orrow, is yet my pride and my delight! your feelings, Mi&s;s Lucy, will under|&s;tand this&mdash;the dear youth left me executrix of that philanthropy which death alone could &s;top in its cour&s;e. To di&s;charge this tru&s;t, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of my life; for I hold my&s;elf bound to di&s;|charge it."</P>
<P>They had now reached the end of the walk, where it opened into a little circle &s;urrounded with trees, and fenced by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ail, in front of an antique looking hou&s;e, the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of which was orna|ment with a rudely-&s;culptur'd cre&s;t, cyphered round with the initials of &s;ome name, which time had rendered illegible; but, a few paces before it, was placed a &s;mall urn, of modern workman&s;hip, and, on a tablet beneath, was written,
<Q>TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM HARLEY.</Q>
Lucy &s;tepped up to read this in&s;cription; "Harley! &s;aid &s;he, how I blu&s;h to think, that I have &s;carcely ever heard of the name&punc;" &mdash;"Alas! &s;aid Mi&s;s Walton, his actions were not of a kind that is loudly talked of: but what is the fame of the world? by him its voice could not now be heard!"&mdash;there was an ardent earne&s;t|ne&s;s in her look, even amid&s;t the melancholy with which her countenance was impre&s;&s;ed. "There is a blank at the bottom of

the tablet," &s;aid Lucy: her companion &s;miled gloomily at the ob&s;ervation, and, leaning on the urn in a pen&s;ive attitude, replied, that it &s;hould one day be filled up.</P>
<P>They now heard the tread of feet approaching the place; Lucy was &s;omewhat alarmed at the &s;ound; but her fears were removed, when &s;he di&s;covered it to proceed from a venerable old man, who advancing towards them, acco&s;ted Mi&s;s Walton by her name, who, in her turn, pronounced the word Peter! in the tone of &s;urprize. She &s;tretched out her hand, which he cla&s;ped in his, and looked in her face with a certain piteous wi&s;tfulne&s;s, while a tear was &s;welling in his eye.</P>
<P>"My dear lady, &s;aid he, I have travelled many a mile &s;ince I &s;aw your lady&s;hip la&s;t: by God's ble&s;&s;ing I have &s;ucceeded very well in the bu&s;ine&s;s your lady&s;hip helped me to &s;et up; and hav|ing &s;ome dealings with a trade&s;man in London, I have been as far as that city and back again; and, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, if I could venture on &s;uch a journey for the &s;ake of gain, may I not take a &s;horter for the &s;ake of thanking my benefactre&s;s, and &s;eeing my old friends in the country? and I had a &s;ort of yerning to be here, to remember good Mrs. Margery, and my dear young ma&s;ter.&mdash; God forgive me for weeping, for he was too good for this world!" &mdash;The tears of Mi&s;s Walton and Lucy accompanied his.&mdash; "Alack-a-day! continued Peter, to think how things will come to pa&s;s! that-there tree was planted by his own &s;weet hand!&mdash; I remember it well, he was then but a boy; I &s;tood behind him, holding the plants in my apron thus;&mdash;"Peter, &s;aid he, as he took one to &s;tick it in the ground, perhaps I &s;hall not live to &s;ee this grow."&mdash;</P>
<P>"God grant your honour may, &s;aid I, when I am dead and gone! and I lifted up the apron to my eyes, for my heart grew big at his words; but he &s;miled up in my face, and &s;aid, "We &s;hall both live, Peter, and that will be be&s;t."&mdash;Ah! I little thought then, Mi&s;s Walton, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle thought!"&mdash;and he &s;hook his thin grey locks!&mdash;The heart of apathy it&s;elf could not have with&s;tood it; Mi&s;s Walton's and Lucy's, melting and tender at all times, were quite overcome.</P>
<P>They &s;tood for &s;ome time &s;ilent; Mi&s;s Walton at la&s;t recollected her&s;elf: "Pardon me, Mi&s;s Sindall, &s;aid &s;he, I was lo&s;t in the indulgence of my grief: let us leave this &s;olemn &s;cene, I have no right to tax you with my &s;orrows." "Call not their participation by that name, an&s;wered Lucy, I know the &s;acredne&s;s of &s;orrow; yours are &s;uch as &s;trengthen the &s;oul while they melt it."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. A change in Bolton's Situation.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader will pardon the digre&s;&s;ion I have made; I would not, willingly, lead him out of his way except into &s;ome path, where his feelings may be expanded, and his heart improved.</P>
<P>He will remember, that I mentioned, in the fourth chapter, the expectation, which Bolton entertained, of &s;eeing his Lucy at a period not very remote.</P>
<P>But that period was not de&s;tined to arrive &s;o &s;oon. When he ex|pected &s;ir Thomas's commands, or rather his permi&s;&s;ion, to vi&s;it the family at Bil&s;wood, he received a letter from that gentleman, purporting, that he had at la&s;t been able, to put him in the way of attaining that independance he had &s;o often wi&s;hed for, having ju&s;t procured him a commi&s;&s;ion in a regiment then &s;tationed at Gibraltar; that though he, (&s;ir Thomas) as well as Mrs. Selwyn, and Lucy, was exceedingly de&s;irous to have an opportunity of bid|ding him farewell, yet he had prevailed on him&s;elf to wave that plea&s;ure, from the con&s;ideration of its inconvenience to Harry, as it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould join his regiment im|mediately.</P>
<P>He inclo&s;ed letters of introduction to &s;everal gentlemen of his acquaintance in London, remitted him drafts on that place, for a con&s;iderable &s;um, to &s;it him out for his intended expedition, and begged that he might lo&s;e no time in repairing thither for that pur|po&s;e. He ended with a&s;&s;uring him of the continuance of his friend&s;hip, which, he declared, no di&s;tance of time, or place, could alienate or impair.</P>
<P>The effect which this letter had upon Bolton, as he was then circum&s;tanced, my readers can ea&s;ily imagine. There was an|other accompanied it; a note from his Lucy: &s;he intended it for comfort, for it a&s;&s;umed the language of con&s;olation; but the de|pre&s;&s;ion of her own &s;pirits was vi&s;ible, amid&s;t the hopes with which &s;he meant to buoy up tho&s;e of Bolton.</P>
<P>With this letter for its text, did his imagination run over all the delights of the pa&s;t, and compare them with the di&s;appointment of the pre&s;ent. Yet tho&s;e tender regrets which the better part of our nature feels have &s;omething in them to blunt the edge of that pain they inflict, and confer on the votaries of &s;orrow a &s;en&s;ation that borders on plea&s;ure. He vi&s;ited the walks which his Lucy had trod, the trees under which &s;he had &s;at, the pro&s;pects they had marked together, and he would not have exchanged his feelings for all that luxury could give, or fe&s;tivity in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Nor did he part with the idea after the object was removed; but, even on the road to London, to which place he began his journey next morning, 'twas but pulling out his letter again,
<PB N="16" REF="018007_0110_0FA45592AFA480B0">
humming over that little melancholy air which his Lucy had prai&s;ed, and the &s;cene was pre&s;ent at once. It drew indeed a &s;igh from his bo&s;om, and an unmanly tear &s;tood in his eye; yet the &s;igh and a tear were &s;uch, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to wi&s;h it removed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. His arrival, and &s;ituation in London.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHEN</HI> Bolton reached the metropolis, he applied, without delay, to tho&s;e per&s;ons for whom he had letters from &s;ir Tho|mas Sindall, who&s;e in&s;tructions the baronet had directed him to fol|low, in that cour&s;e of military duty which he had now enabled him to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>In the reception he met with, it is not &s;urprizing that he was di&s;appointed He looked for that cordial friend&s;hip, that warm attachment which is only to be found in the &s;maller circles of private life, which is lo&s;t in the hu&s;tle, and extended connexion of large &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>The letters, he pre&s;ented, were read with a civil indifference, and produced the unmeaning profe&s;&s;ions of ceremony and politene&s;s. From &s;ome of tho&s;e to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, he had invitations, which he accepted with diffidence, to fea&s;ts which he partook with di&s;gu&s;t; where he &s;at, amid&s;t the profu&s;ion of o&s;tentatious wealth, &s;urrounded with company he did not know, and li&s;tening to di&s;cour&s;e in which he was not qualified to join.</P>
<P>A plain hone&s;t trade&s;man, to whom he happened to carry a commi&s;|&s;ion from Mrs. Wi&s;tanly, was the only per&s;on who &s;eemed to take an intere&s;t in his welfare. At this man's hou&s;e he received the welcome of a favoured acquaint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ce, he eat of the family-dinner, and heard the je&s;t which ro&s;e for their amu&s;ement; for ceremony did not regulate the figure of their table, nor had fa&s;hion bani&s;hed the language of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ture from their lips.</P>
<P>Under this man's guidance he tran&s;acted any little bu&s;ine&s;s his &s;itua|tion required, and was frequently conducted by him to tho&s;e very doors, who&s;e lordly owners received him in that manner, which grandeur thinks it&s;elf entitled to a&s;&s;ume, and dependanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is con&s;trained to endure.</P>
<P>After &s;ome days of enquiry and &s;olicitude, he learned, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary for him to join his regiment &s;o &s;peedily as &s;ir Thomas's let|ter had induced him to believe.</P>
<P>Upon obtaining this information he immediately communicated it to the baronet, and &s;ignified at the &s;ame time, a de&s;ire of improving that time, which this re&s;pite allowed him for his &s;tay in England, in a vi&s;it to the family at Bil&s;wood. But with this purpo&s;e his cou&s;in's ideas did not at all coincide; he wrote Harry an an&s;wer, di&s;approv|ing
<PB N="17" REF="018007_0111_0FA455936CF7A860">
entirely his intentions of leaving London, and laid down a plan for his improvement in military &s;cience, which could only be followed in the metropolis. Here was another di&s;appointment; but Harry con&s;idered it his duty to obey.</P>
<P>What he felt, however, may be gathered from the following letter, which he wrote to Mi&s;s Sindall, by the po&s;t &s;ucceeding that, which brought him the in&s;tructions of &s;ir Thomas.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>As I found, &s;oon after my arrival here, that the nece&s;&s;ity of joining my regiment immediately was &s;uper&s;eded, I hoped, by this time, to have informed my deare&s;t Lucy, of my intended departure from London, to be once more re&s;tored to her and the country."</P>
<P>I have &s;uffered the mortification of another di&s;appointment; &s;ir Thomas's letter is now before me, which fixes me here for the winter; I confe&s;s the rea&s;onablene&s;s of his opinion; but rea&s;on and &s;ir Thomas cannot feel like Bolton."</P>
<P>When we parted la&s;t we flattered our&s;elves with other pro&s;pects; cruel as the reflexion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is, I feel a &s;ort of plea&s;ure in recalling it; e&s;pecially when I ventured to believe, that my Lucy has not forgotten our parting."</P>
<P>To morrow is Cri&s;tmas-day; I call to remembrance our la&s;t year's holidays: may the&s;e be as happy with you, though I am not to partake them. Write me every particular of the&s;e days of jollity; fear not, as your la&s;t letter expre&s;&s;es it, tiring me with trifles: nothing is a trifle in which you are concerned. While I read the account, I will fancy my&s;elf at Bil&s;wood; here I will walk forth an unnoticed thing amid&s;t the bu&s;y croud that &s;urrounds me: your letters give me &s;ome intere&s;t in my&s;elf, becau&s;e they &s;how me that I am &s;omething to my Lucy; &s;he is every thing to her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Filial Piety.</HEAD>
<P>BOLTON had a di&s;po&s;ition towards &s;ociety, that did not al|low him an indifference about any thing of human form with whom he could have an opportunity of intercour&s;e. He was every one's friend in his heart, till &s;ome po&s;itive demerit rendered a per|&s;on unworthy his good-will.</P>
<P>He had not long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his lodgings in town, till he cultivated an acquaintance with his landlord and landlady; the latter he found to be the repre&s;entative of the family, from a power of lo|quacity very much &s;uperior to her hu&s;band, who &s;eemed to be wonderfully plea&s;ed with his wife's conver&s;ation, and very happy under what might, not improperly, be termed her government. To Mrs. Terwitt, therefore, (for that was the lady's name) did Bolton addre&s;s his approaches towards an acquaintance, and from
<PB N="18" REF="018007_0112_0FA4559450782FC0">
her he had the good fortune to find them meet with a favourable reception: they were &s;o intimate the &s;econd week of his re&s;idence in the hou&s;e, that &s;he told him the be&s;t part of the tran&s;actions of her life; and con&s;ulted him upon the di&s;po&s;al of her elde&s;t daughter in marriage, whom a young trade&s;man, &s;he &s;aid, had been in &s;uit of ever &s;ince the Ea&s;ter-holidays preceding.</P>
<P>"We can give her, added &s;he, &s;omething hand&s;ome enough for a portion; and the old gentleman above &s;tairs has promi&s;ed her a pre&s;ent of a hundred pounds on her wedding day, provided &s;he marries to plea&s;e him."</P>
<P>"The gentleman above &s;tairs! &s;aid Bolton; how have I been &s;o unlucky as never to have heard of him before?" "He is not at pre&s;ent in town,', replied the landlady, "having gone about a fortnight ago to Bath, whence he is not yet returned. Indeed, I fear, his health requires &s;ome &s;tay at that place, for he has been but poorly of late; heaven pre&s;erve his life! for he is a good friend of ours, and of many one's el&s;e who &s;tand in need of his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>He has an e&s;tate, &s;ir, of a thou&s;and pounds a year, and money be&s;ides, as I have been told; yet he chu&s;es to live private, as you will &s;ee; and &s;pends, I believe, the mo&s;t of his income in charit|able actions."</P>
<P>"I did indeed, &s;aid Harry, ob&s;erve a young man come to the door this morning at an early hour, and I heard him a&s;k if the gentleman was returned; but I did not then know that he meant any per&s;on who lodged here." "Ay, &s;ure enough he meant Mr. Rawlin&s;on, &s;aid Mrs. Terwitt, and I wi&s;h he may not feel his ab|&s;ence much; for he has called here frequently of late, and, the la&s;t time, when he was told of his not being yet returned, Betty ob&s;erved that the tears gu&s;hed from his eyes." "When he calls again, &s;aid Bolton, I beg that I may be informed of it."</P>
<P>Next morning he heard &s;omebody knock at the door, much a|bout the time he had &s;een the young man approach it the preced|ing day: upon going to the window, he ob&s;erved the &s;ame &s;trip|ling, but his dre&s;s was different; he had no coat to cover a thread|ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e wai&s;tcoat, nor had he any hat.</P>
<P>Bolton let the maid know, that he was aware of his being at the door, and re&s;umed his own &s;tation at the window. The youth repeated his enquiries after Mr. Rawlin&s;on, and, upon receiving the &s;ame an&s;wer, ca&s;t up to heaven a look of re&s;ignation, and retired.</P>
<P>Bolton &s;lipped down &s;tairs, and followed him; his lodgings were &s;ituated near Queen-Square: the lad took the country-road, and went on without &s;topping till he reached Pancras-church-yard. He &s;tood &s;eemingly entranced, over a new covered grave at one and of it. Harry placed him&s;elf under cover of a tomb hard by, where he could mark him unperceived.</P>
<P>He held his hands cla&s;ped in one another, and the tears began to trickle down his cheeks. Bolton &s;tole from out his hiding-place,
<PB N="19" REF="018007_0113_0FA45594F5DAA2E8">
and approached towards the &s;pot. The poor lad began to &s;peak, as if addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the dead beneath. "Thou can&s;t not feel their cruelty; nor &s;hall the winds of winter chill thee, as they do thy wretched &s;on; &mdash; Inhuman mi&s;creants! but the&s;e &s;hall cover thee"&mdash;He threw him&s;elf on the ground, and &s;pread his arms over the grave, on which he wept.</P>
<P>Bolton &s;tooped down to rai&s;e him from the earth; he turned, and gazed on him, with a look wildered and piteous, "Pardon a &s;tranger, young man, &s;aid Bolton, who cannot but be intere&s;ted in your &s;orrow; he is not entitled to a&s;k its cau&s;e, yet his heart &s;wells with the hope of removing it." &mdash; "May heaven requite you, replied the &s;tranger, for your pity to a poor orphan! Oh! &s;ir, I have not been u&s;ed to beg, and even to receive charity is hard upon me; did I mean to move compa&s;&s;ion, I have a &s;tory to tell.&mdash;You weep already, &s;ir! hear me, and judge if I de&s;erve your tears."</P>
<P>"Here lies my father, the only relation whom misfortune had left to own me; but heaven had &s;ent us a friend in that be&s;t of men, Mr. Rawlin&s;on. He came accidentally to the knowlege of our &s;ufferings, and took on him&s;elf the charge of relieving them, which the cruelty of our own connexions had abandoned; but alas! when, by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, my father was put into a way of earning his bread, he was &s;eized with that illne&s;s of which he died. Some &s;mall debts, which his &s;hort time in bu&s;ine&s;s had not yet allowed him to di&s;charge, were put in &s;uit again&s;t him by his creditors. His &s;ickne&s;s, and death, which happened a few days ago, did but ha&s;ten their proceedings; they &s;eized, &s;ir, the very covering of that bed on which his body was laid. Mr. Rawlin&s;on was out of town, and I fancy he never received tho&s;e letters I wrote him to Bath.</P>
<P>"I had no one from whom to expect relief; every thing but the&s;e rags on my back, I &s;old to bury the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell of fathers; but my little all was not enough; and the man whom I employed for his funeral, took ye&s;terday, from off the&s;e clods, the very &s;od which had covered him, becau&s;e I had not wherewithal to pay its price."</P>
<P>Bolton fell on his neck, and an&s;wered him with his tears.</P>
<P>He covered the du&s;t of the father, and clothed the nakedne&s;s of the &s;on; and, having placed him where it was in his power to make future enquiries after his &s;ituation, left him to ble&s;s Provi|dence for the aid it had &s;ent, without knowing the hand through which its bounty had flowed. That hand, indeed, the grateful youth pre&s;&s;ed to his lips at parting, and begged earne&s;tly to know the name of his benefactor. "I am a friend, &s;aid Bolton, of Mr. Rawlin&s;on, and humanity."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. A very alarming accident; which proves the means of Bolton's getting acquainted with his fellow-lodger.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Bolton returned, in the evening, from tho&s;e labours of charity he had undertaken, he found that the family were abroad, &s;upping, in a body, with the daughter's lover: the maid &s;at up to wait their home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">coming; and Bolton, who had more liberty, but much le&s;s inclination to &s;leep, betook him&s;elf to meditation.</P>
<P>It was now near midnight, and the hum of Betty's &s;pinning-wheel, which had frequently intermitted before, became entirely &s;ilent, when Bolton was alarmed with a very loud knocking of the watchman at the door, and pre&s;ently a confu&s;ed a&s;&s;emblage of voices crying out, Fire! Fire! echoed from one end of the &s;treet to the other. Upon opening his window, he di&s;covered too plain|ly the rea&s;on of the alarm; the flames were already appearing at the windows of the ground-floor, to which they had probably been communicated by the candle, which the maid had burning by her in the kitchen below.</P>
<P>She had now at la&s;t awaked, and was running about before the door of the hou&s;e, wringing her hands, and &s;peaking incoherently to the few who were a&s;&s;embled by the outcry, without having re|collection enough to endeavour to &s;ave any thing belonging to her|&s;elf or her ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Bolton, who had more the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his faculties, entreating the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome watchmen, whom the occa&s;ion had drawn together, made &s;hift to convey into the &s;treet, a few things which he took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be the mo&s;t valuable; de&s;iring Betty, to be &s;o much mi&s;|tre&s;s of her&s;elf, as to keep an eye upon them for her ma&s;ter's benefit.</P>
<P>She continued, however, her broken exclamations of horror and de&s;pair, till, at la&s;t, &s;tarting as it were into the remembrance of &s;omething forgot, &s;he cried out vehemently, "Oh! my God! where is Mr. Rawlin&s;on?"</P>
<P>Bolton caught the horrid meaning of her que&s;tion, and pu&s;hing through the flames, which had now taken hold of the &s;tairca&s;e, forced his way into the bed-chamber occupied by the old gentle|man, who had returned from the country that very evening, and, being fatigued with his journey, had gone to bed before his fellow lodger's arrival at home.</P>
<P>He had not waked till the room under that where he lay was in a blaze, and, on attempting to ri&s;e, was &s;tifled with the &s;moke that pou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in at every cranny of the floor, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s at his bed-&s;ide, where Bolton found him upon entering the room.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="018007_0115_0FA455972CAC7E30">On endeavouring to carry him down &s;tairs, he found it had now become impracticable, &s;everal of the &s;teps having been quite burnt away, and fallen down in flaming brands, &s;ince the moment before, when he had a&s;cended.</P>
<P>He had pre&s;ence of mind enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to ob&s;erve, that the back-part of the hou&s;e was not &s;o immedia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly affected by the flames&punc; he carried Mr. Rawlin&s;on therefore into a room on that &s;ide, and, having beat out the &s;a&s;h, admitted air enough to revive him. The latter pre&s;ently recollected his &s;ituation, and a&s;king Harry, if it was po&s;&s;ible to get down &s;tairs, heard him an&s;wer in the negative with remarkable compo&s;ure. "As for me, &s;aid he, I &s;hall lo&s;e but few of my days; but I fear, &s;ir, your generous concern for a &s;tranger, has endangered a life much more valuable than mine: let me beg of you to endeavour to &s;ave your&s;elf, which your &s;trength and agility may enable you to do, without regarding a poor, worn-out, old man, who would only encumber you in the attempt." Bolton, with a &s;olemn earne&s;tne&s;s, declared, that no con&s;ideration &s;hould tempt him to &s;uch a de&s;ertion.</P>
<P>He had, before this, vainly endeavoured to procure a ladder, or &s;ome other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from the people below; the confu&s;ion of the &s;cene prevented their affording it: he con&s;idered, therefore, if he could not furni&s;h &s;ome expedient from within, and having untied the cordage of a bed, which &s;tood in the room, he found it would make a &s;ufficient length of rope to reach within a few feet of the ground.</P>
<P>This he fa&s;tened round Mr. Rawlin&s;on's wai&s;t, in &s;uch a way, that his arms &s;hould &s;upport part of the weight of his body, and &s;liding it over the edge of the window, &s;o as to cau&s;e &s;omewhat more re&s;i&s;tance in the de&s;cent, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et him down, in that manner, till he was within reach of &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance below, who caught him in their arms; then fa&s;tening the end of the rope round the po&s;t of the bed, he &s;lid &s;o far down upon it him&s;elf, that he could &s;afely leap to the ground.</P>
<P>He conveyed Mr. Rawlin&s;on to other lodgings hard by, which then happened to be vacant; and having got him accommodated with &s;ome cloaths belonging to the landlord, he returned to &s;ee what progre&s;s the fire had been making, when he found, that, happily, from a piece of wa&s;te ground's lying between the hou&s;e where it broke out, and the other to the leeward, it was got &s;o much under, as to be in no danger of &s;preading any farther.</P>
<P>Upon going back to Mr. Rawlin&s;on, he found him &s;itting in the mid&s;t of the family with whom he had lodged, mini&s;tring com|fort to their di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;es&punc; the unfortunate Betty, whom, as &s;he &s;tood &s;elf condemned for her neglect, he con&s;idered as the greate&s;t &s;ufferer, he had placed next him.

<HEAD>CHAP X. Effects of his accquaintance with Mr. Rawlin&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH was Bolton's introduction to Mr. Rawlin&s;on's acquaint|ance; and from the circum&s;tances of its commencement, my readers will ea&s;ily believe, that neither party could be indifferent to its continuation. Rawlin&s;on &s;aw his own virtues warm and ac|tive in the bo&s;om of his young friend; while Harry contemplated, with equal delight, that &s;erenity which their recollection be&s;towed on the declining age of Rawlin&s;on.</P>
<P>In one of his vi&s;its to the old gentleman, &s;ome time after the ac|cident related in the foregoing chapter, he found with him that very youth, who&s;e &s;orrow, over the grave of his father, he had &s;o lately been the means of alleviating. The young man was, in|deed, in the mid&s;t of their recital as Bolton entered the room, and had ju&s;t mentioned, with regret, his ignorance of his benefactor, when the door opened and di&s;covered him.</P>
<P>Bolton could not help blu&s;hing at the di&s;covery; the other &s;tart|ing from his &s;eat, exclaimed, "it is he, it is him&s;elf," threw him&s;elf on his knees before Harry, with tears in his eyes, and poured out &s;ome broken expre&s;&s;ions of the warme&s;t gratitude. "It was you then, &s;aid Mr. Rawlin&s;on, who were the comforter of my poor boy, who covered the grave of his unfortunate father! I will not thank you, for Jack is doing it better with his tears; but I will thank heaven, that there are &s;ome &s;uch men to pre&s;erve my veneration for the &s;pecies."</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t, my dear &s;ir, &s;aid Bolton, that there are many to whom &s;uch actions are habitual."&mdash;"You are a young man, interrupted the other, and it is fit you &s;hould believe &s;o; I will believe &s;o too, for I have &s;ometimes known what it is to enjoy them. &mdash;Go, my boy, turning to the lad, and wi&s;h for the luxury of doing good; remember Mr. Bolton, and be not forgetful of Providence."</P>
<P>"The father of that young man, &s;aid Mr. Rawlin&s;on, when he was gone, was a &s;chool-fellow of mine here in town, and one of the worthie&s;t creatures in the world; but from a milkine&s;s of di&s;|po&s;ition, without the direction of prudence, or the guard of &s;u&s;pi|cion, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to become a dupe to the artifices of &s;ome de&s;igning men; and when, &s;ome time ago. I di&s;covered his place of abode in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o ob&s;cure village in the country, I found him &s;tripped
<PB N="23" REF="018007_0117_0FA4559A919AD218">
of his patrimony, and burthened with the charge of that boy, who has ju&s;t now left us, who&s;e mother, it &s;eems, had died when he was a child.</P>
<P>"Yet, amid&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his poverty, I found that ea&s;ine&s;s of temper, which had contributed to bring them on, had not for|&s;aken him; he met me with a &s;mile of &s;atisfaction, and talked of the cruel indifference of &s;ome wealthy relations, without the emo|tions of anger, or the acrimony of di&s;appointment. He &s;eemed, indeed, to feel for his child; but comforted him&s;elf at the &s;ame time with the reflexion; that he had bred him to expect adver&s;ity with compo&s;ure, and to &s;uffer poverty with contentment. He died, poor man, when I had put him in a way of living with &s;ome comfort; nor had I even an opportunity of doing the common offi|ces of friend&s;hip to his la&s;t moments, my health having obliged me to go down to Bath, whence I had removed to Bri&s;tol, and did not receive any accounts of his illne&s;s till my return to London. I am in your debt, Mr. Bolton, for &s;ome &s;upplies to his &s;on; let me know what tho&s;e were, that we may clear the account."</P>
<P>Bolton replied, that he hoped Mr. Rawlin&s;on could not wi&s;h to deprive him of the plea&s;ure he felt from the reflexion of having a&s;|&s;i&s;ted &s;o much filial piety in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"It &s;hall be in your own way, &s;aid the old gentleman; I am not &s;uch a niggard as to grudge you the opportunity; yet I can|not but regret my ab&s;ence, when I &s;hould have clo&s;ed the eyes of poor Jennings. He was the la&s;t of tho&s;e companions of my child|hood, who&s;e hi&s;tory in life I had occa&s;ion to be acquainted with; the re&s;t, Mr. Bolton, had already fallen around me, and I am now left within a little of the grave, without a friend (except one, whom accident has acquired me in you) to &s;mooth the path that leads to it; but that is &s;hort, and therefore it matters not much. At my age, nature her&s;elf may be expected to decline; but a lingering illne&s;s is &s;hortening her date.</P>
<P>"I would do therefore what good I can, in the &s;pace that is left me, and look forward, if I may be allowed, to make &s;ome pro|vi&s;ion for the &s;ervice of futurity. Here are two papers, &s;ir, which, on mature deliberation, I have judged it proper to commit to your cu&s;tody; that in the parchment cover, which is not labelled, my death alone will authorize you to open; the other, marked "Tru&s;t-deed by Mr. Anne&s;ly," I can explain to you now.</P>
<P>That man, Mr. Bolton, who is now a &s;aint in heaven, was prepared for it by the &s;evere&s;t calamities on earth: the guilt, and misfortunes of two darling children, cut &s;hort the remnant of a life, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to guide, and who&s;e plea&s;ure to behold them in the paths of virtue and of happine&s;s. At the time of his death they were both alive; one, alas! did not long &s;urvive her father; what has become of her brother, I have never been able to learn; but this tru&s;t, put into my hands in their behalf, may &s;till be of importance to him or his, and to you therefore I make it over for that purpo&s;e; for though, by Mr. Anne&s;ly's &s;ettlement, the &s;ubject
<PB N="24" REF="018007_0118_0FA4559C4E50BBE0">
of the tru&s;t accrues to me on the failure of his own i&s;&s;ue, yet would I never con&s;ider it as mine, while the &s;malle&s;t chance remained of his &s;on, or the de&s;cendant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his &s;on, &s;urviving; and even were the negative certain, I &s;hould then only look on my&s;elf as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eward of my friend, for purpo&s;es which his goodne&s;s would have dictated, and it becomes his tru&s;tee to fulfil. In &s;uch a charge I will not in&s;truct my executor; I have been fortunate enough to find one who&s;e heart will in&s;truct him."</P>
<P>Bolton, while he promi&s;ed an execution of this tru&s;t worthy of the confidence repo&s;ed in him, could not help expre&s;&s;ing his &s;ur|prize at Mr. Rawlin&s;on's choice of him for that purpo&s;e. "I do not wonder, replied the other, that you &s;hould think thus, for thus has cu&s;tom taught us to think; I have told you how friendle&s;s and unconnected I am; but while we trace the relatives of birth and kindred, &s;hall we allow nothing to the ties of the heart, or the &s;ympathy of virtue."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. A remarkable event in the hi&s;tory of Bolton.&mdash;His behaviour in con&s;equence of it.</HEAD>
<P>THE provi&s;ions which Mr. Rawlin&s;on had made, for an event of which he had accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to think with compo&s;ure, were but too predictive of its arrival. That worthy man lived not many weeks after the convention with Bolton, which I have ju&s;t recorded.</P>
<P>Bolton was affected with the mo&s;t lively &s;orrow for his death. This friend&s;hip, though but lately acquired, had &s;omething uncommonly ardent in its attachment, and liberal in its confidence. Harry, who had returned it in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved manner, felt the want both of that kindne&s;s which &s;oothed, and that wi&s;dom which in&s;tructed him.</P>
<P>Upon opening the &s;ealed paper which had been formerly put into his hands by Mr. Rawlin&s;on, it was &s;ound to be that gen|tleman's will, devi&s;ing his whole e&s;tate. real and per&s;onal, to Mr. Bolton. The rea&s;on given for this, in the body of the paper it&s;elf, was expre&s;&s;ed in the following words:
<Q>Becau&s;e I know no man who has de&s;erved more of my&s;elf; none who will de&s;erve more of mankind, in the di&s;po&s;al of what I have thus bequeathed him.</Q></P>
<P>Bolton was fully &s;en&s;ible of af the force of this recommendation to the exerci&s;e of a virtue which he had always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and had only wanted power to practi&s;e. He acted as the almoner of Mr. Rawlin&s;on, and ju&s;tified his friend's method of benefaction, (for &s;o this di&s;po&s;al of his affairs might be called) by joining with the inclination to do good, that choice of object and that attention to
<PB N="25" REF="018007_0119_0FA4559C873440E8">
propriety, which dignifies the purpo&s;e, and doubles the u&s;e of bene&s;icence. Having &s;ettled accounts of this kind in town, (among&s;t which tho&s;e of young Jennings and the Terwitt-family were not forgotten) he &s;et out for that e&s;tate which had now devolved to him by the will of Mr. Rawlin&s;on, With what ideas he made this vi&s;it, and in what manner he expre&s;&s;ed them on his arrival, I &s;hall allow his own words to de&s;cribe, in the following letter to Mi&s;s Sindall.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Wilbrook.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P><HI>My Lucy will not blame me for want of attention, becau&s;e &s;he has heard of what the world will call, my good fortune, only from the relation of others. To her I could not addre&s;s tho&s;e &s;hort letters of recital, which I was obliged to write to &s;ir Thomas. She will not doubt her Henry's remembrance at all times; it is only with rela|tion to tho&s;e we love that pro&s;perity can produce happine&s;s, and our virtues them&s;elves are nouri&s;hed from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;ome favourite &s;uffrage. The length of this letter &s;hall make up for a &s;ilence occa&s;ioned by various interruptions. I have had a good deal of bu&s;ine&s;s for the pre&s;ent; I have been forming &s;ome project for the future: the idea of my Lucy was ab&s;ent from neither.</HI></P>
<P><HI>After the death of Mr. Rawlin&s;on, the friend of mankind as of your Harry, there were &s;ome offices of duty which the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of &s;uch a man was peculiarly bound to perform. Though I could di&s;cover no re|lation of his but one, (who&s;e fortune, as it had formerly taught him to overlook his kin&s;man, &s;tood not now in need of that kin&s;man's acknow|legement) yet there were numbers whom humanity had allied to him. Their claim of affinity was now upon me, and their provi&s;ion a debt which I was called upon to di&s;charge: this kept me &s;ome time in Lon|don. I have another family here, whom it was al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to re|member; I have been among them a week, and we have not been unhappy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When I looked into the conveyances of this e&s;tate, I found it had been once before transferred, in a manner not very common in the di&s;|po&s;al of modern property. Its owner immediately preceding Mr. Raw|lin&s;on, was a friend and companion of his, who had gone out to India &s;ome years later than he, and, by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, had been put in the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of acquiring a very large fortune. The greate&s;t part of this he reminded to his former benefactor in England, to be laid out on &s;ome purcha&s;e near the place of his nativity, which it &s;eems was a village but a few miles di&s;tant from Wilbrook. This e&s;tate was then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a gentleman, who&s;e London expences had &s;quandered the &s;avings of four or five generations, and, after having exhau&s;ted every other re&s;ource, he was obliged to &s;ell this inheritance of his family. Mr. Rawlin&s;on gave him the price he a&s;ked, and made a pre&s;ent of a con&s;iderable &s;um be&s;ides to a very de&s;erving woman who had the mi&s;|fortune to be the wife of this &s;pendthrift. His friend ratified the bargain with thanks; but he lived not to enjoy his purcha&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="018007_0120_0FA4559D36CE1720">A fever carried him off in his pa&s;&s;age to England, and he be|queathed his e&s;tate to him, by who&s;e former good offices he had been enabled to acquire it.</P>
<P>The new proprietor took a &s;ingular method of improving i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s value. He lowered the rents, which had been rai&s;ed to an extra|vagant height, and recalled the ancient tenants of the manor, mo&s;t of whom had been driven from the unfriendly foil, to make room for de&s;perate adventurers, who undertook for rents they could never be able to pay.&mdash;To &s;uch a man was I to &s;ucceed, and I was con&s;cious how much was required of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The third day after my arrival, I gave a general invitation to my ten|ants and their families to dine with me.</P>
<P>The hall was trimmed for their reception, and &s;ome large an|tique pieces of plate, with which Mr. Rawlin&s;on had furni&s;hed his cupboard, were ranged on the large table at the end of it. With|out doors &s;tood a ca&s;k of excellent &s;trong beer for any one of in|ferior quality who cho&s;e to drink of it, di&s;pen&s;ed by an old, but jolly-looking &s;ervant, who&s;e face was the &s;ignal of welcome.</P>
<P>I received my gue&s;ts as friends and acquaintance; a&s;ked the names of their children, and prai&s;ed the blufne&s;s of the boys, and the beauty of the girls. I placed one of the mo&s;t matronly wives in the wicker-chair at the head of the table; and, occupying the lowe&s;t place my&s;elf, &s;tationed the re&s;t of the company according to their age on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The dinner had all the appearance of plainne&s;s and of plenty: among&s;t other di&s;hes four large pieces of roa&s;t beef were placed at uniform di&s;tances, and a plum pudding of a very uncommon cir|cumference was rai&s;ed con&s;picuous in the middle. I pre&s;&s;ed the ba&s;hful among the girls, commended the frankne&s;s of their fathers, and pledged the jollie&s;t of the &s;et in repeated draughts of &s;trong-beer.</P>
<P>But, though this had the de&s;ired effect with &s;ome, I could ob|&s;erve in the countenances of others evident marks of di&s;tru&s;t and apprehen&s;ion. The cloth therefore was no &s;ooner removed, and the grace-cup drank, then I ro&s;e up in my place, and addre&s;&s;ed my gue&s;ts to the following purpo&s;e:</P>
<Q><P>The &s;atisfaction, my worthy friends, with which I now meet you, is damped by the recollection of that lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tained in the death of your late excellent ma&s;ter.

I call you to witne&s;s, that I hold his e&s;tate by no other title.</P>
<P>I have given orders to my &s;teward to renew &s;uch of your lea&s;es as are near expiring, at the rent which you have heretofore paid. If there is an article of encouragement or convenience wanting to any of you, let him apply to my&s;elf, and I will immediately enquire into it. No man is above the bu&s;ine&s;s of doing good.</P>

It is cu&s;tomary, I believe, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, for the tenant to pay a certain fine or premium to the landlord: I too, my friends, will expect one; you and your families &s;hall pay it me &mdash;be indu&s;trious, be virtuous, be happy.</P></Q>
<P>An exclamation of joy and applau&s;e, which the la&s;t part of my &s;peech had &s;carcely been able to &s;tifle, now bur&s;t forth around me. I need not tell my Lucy what I felt; her heart can judge of my feelings; &s;he will believe me when I &s;ay, that I would not have exchanged them for the revenue of a monarch.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the day was &s;pent in all the genuine fe&s;tivity of happy &s;pirits. I had enlarged a room adjoining to the hall, by &s;triking down a partition at one end; and clo&s;ed the entertainment with a dance, which I led up my&s;elf with the ro&s;y-cheeked daughter of one of my principal tenants.</P>
<P>This vi&s;it I have already returned to &s;everal of tho&s;e hone&s;t folks. I found their little dwellings clean and comfortable, and happine&s;s and good-humour &s;eemed the gue&s;ts of them all. I have commonly ob&s;erved cleanline&s;s and contentment to be com|panions among&s;t the lower ranks of the country-people; nor is it difficult to account for this: there is a &s;elf &s;atisfaction in content|ed minds which di&s;po&s;es to activity and neatne&s;s; whereas the reckle&s;s la&s;&s;itude that weighs down the unhappy, &s;eldom fails to make drunkards of the men, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">latterns of the women. I com|mended highly the neatne&s;s which I found in the farm-hou&s;es on my e&s;tate; and made their owners pre&s;ents of various hou&s;hold orna|ments by way of encouragement.</P>
<P>I know the u&s;ual mode of <HI>improving</HI> e&s;tates; I was told by &s;ome &s;agacious advi&s;ers in London that mine was <HI>improvable</HI>: but I am too &s;elfi&s;h to be contented with money; I would encrea&s;e <HI>the love of my people.</HI></P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, and to-day, I have been employed in &s;urveying the grounds adjoining to the hou&s;e. Nature here reigns without controul; for Mr. Rawlin&s;on did not attend very much to her im|provement; and I have heard him &s;ay, that he conceived a cer|tain e&s;teem for an old tree, or even an old wall, that would hard|ly allow him to think of cutting the one, or pulling down the other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. A change in the family of &s;ir Thomas Sindall.&mdash; Some account of a per&s;on whom that event introduces to Mi&s;s Lucy's acquaintance.</HEAD>
<P>THE an&s;wer which Bolton received to the foregoing letter, contained a piece of intelligence material to the &s;ituation of Mi&s;s Sindall; it conveyed to him an account of the death of Mrs. Selwyn.</P>
<P>Though that lady was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many amiable or engaging qualities, yet Lucy, to whom &s;he had always &s;hown as much kindne&s;s as her nature allowed her to be&s;tow on any one, felt a very lively &s;orrow for her death, even exclu&s;ive of the immediate con&s;equences which her&s;elf was to expect from that event.</P>
<P>The&s;e indeed were apparently momentous. Mrs. Selwyn had been her guardian and protectre&s;s from her infancy; and though &s;ir Thomas Sindall had ever behaved to her like a father, yet there was a feeling in the bo&s;om of Lucy, that revolted again&s;t the idea of continuing in his hou&s;e after his aunt's decea&s;e. By that lady's will &s;he was entitled to a legacy of &s;ix hundred pounds; by means of this &s;um &s;he had formed a &s;cheme, which, though it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">educe her to a &s;tate very different from the ea&s;e and affluence of her former circum&s;tances, might yet &s;ecure her from the irk&s;omene&s;s of dependance, or the accu&s;ation of impropriety; this was, to appropriate two thirds of the intere&s;t of her capital to the payment of an annual &s;um for her board with Mrs. Wi&s;tanly.</P>
<P>It was now that Bolton felt the advantage of independance from the hopes of being u&s;eful to Lucy; but he had her delicacy to overcome: &s;he would not throw her&s;elf, at this moment of nece&s;&s;ity, into the arms of a man whom fortune had now placed above her. She adhered to her fir&s;t re&s;olution.</P>
<P>But the kindne&s;s of &s;ir Thomas Sindall rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary; for, a &s;hort time after Mrs. Selwyn's death, when Mi&s;s Sindall communicated to him her intention of leaving his hou&s;e, he addre&s;&s;ed her in the following terms: "I have always looked upon you, Mi&s;s Lucy, as a daughter, and, I hope, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as been no want of tenderne&s;s or attention on the &s;ide of my aunt or my&s;elf to have prevented your regarding us as parents.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, I know the opinions of the world; mi&s;taken and illiberal as they often are, there is a deference which we are obliged to pay them: in your &s;ex the &s;en&s;e of decorum &s;hould he ever awake; even in this ca&s;e, I would not attempt to plead a|gain&s;t its voice; but I hope I have hit on a method which will perfectly reconcile propriety and convenience. There is a lady,
<PB N="29" REF="018007_0123_0FA4559F6C5CD3A8">
a di&s;tant relation of our family, whom a marriage, &s;uch as the world terms imprudent, bani&s;hed in early life from the notice or protection of it; but, though they could refu&s;e their &s;uffrage to the match, they could not controul its happine&s;s; and, during the life of Mr. Boothby, (for that was her hu&s;band's name) &s;he expe|rienced all the felicity of which wedlock is &s;u&s;ceptible. Yet on her hu&s;band's death, which happened about five years after their marriage, the &s;tate of his affairs was found to be &s;uch, that &s;he &s;tood but too much in need of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which her relations denied her.</P>
<P>At the time of her giving the family this offence, I was a boy: and I &s;carce ever heard of her name till I was apprized of her mi&s;|fortunes. Whatever &s;ervices I have been able to do her, I have found repaid by the &s;incere&s;t gratitude, and improved to the worthie&s;t purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Upon the late event of my aunt's death, I was naturally led to wi&s;h her place &s;upplied by Mrs. Boothby; &s;he has done me the favor to accept of my invitation, and I expect her here this evening. Of any thing like authority in this hou&s;e, Mi&s;s Lucy, you &s;hall be always independant; but I flatter my&s;elf &s;he has qualities &s;uf|ficient to merit your friend&s;hip." Lucy returned &s;uch an an&s;wer, as the kindne&s;s and delicacy of this &s;peech de&s;erved; and it was agreed, that, for the pre&s;ent, her purpo&s;e of leaving Bil&s;wood &s;hould be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>In the evening the expected lady arrived; &s;he &s;eemed to be a|bout the age ot fifty, with an impre&s;&s;ion of melancholy on her countenance, that appeared to have worn away her beauty before the u&s;ual period: &s;ome traces however &s;till remained, and her eyes&punc; when they met the view of the world, which was but &s;eldom, di&s;|covered a brilliancy not extingui&s;hed by her &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Her appearance, joined to the knowlege of her &s;tory, did not fail to attract Mi&s;s Sindall's regard; &s;he received Mrs. Boothby with an air, not of civility, but friend&s;hip; and the other &s;howed a &s;en&s;e of the obligation conferred on her, by a look of that mode&s;t tender &s;ort, which equally acknowleges and &s;olicits our kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>With misfortune a good heart ea&s;ily makes an acquaintance. Mi&s;s Sindall endeavoured, by a thou&s;and little a&s;&s;iduities, to &s;trow this lady the intere&s;t &s;he took in her welfare. That re&s;erve, which the humility of affliction, not an un&s;ocial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pirit, &s;eemed to have taught Mrs. Boothby, wore off by degrees; their mutual e&s;teem encrea&s;ed as their characters opened to each other: and, in a &s;hort time, their confidence was unre&s;erved, and their friend|&s;hip appeared to be inviolable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Boothby had now the &s;atisfaction of pouring the tale of her di&s;tre&s;&s;es into the ear of &s;ympathy and friend&s;hip. Her &s;tory was melancholy, but not uncommon; the wreck of her hu&s;band's af|fairs by a mind too enlarged for his fortune, and an indulgence of inclinations laudable in their kind, but faulty in relation to the circum&s;tances of their owner.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="018007_0124_0FA455A039BCE240">In the hi&s;tory of her young friend's life, there were but few in|cidents to communicate in return. She could only &s;ay, that &s;he remembered her&s;elf, from her infancy, an orphan, under the care of &s;ir Thomas Sindall and his aunt; that &s;he had lived with them in a &s;tate of quiet and &s;implicity, without having &s;een much of the world, or wi&s;hing to &s;ee it. She had but one &s;ecret to di&s;clo&s;e in earne&s;t of her friend&s;hip: it faltered for &s;ome time on her lips; at la&s;t &s;he ventured to let Mrs. Boothby know it &mdash; her attachment to Bolton.</P>
<P>From this intelligence the other was led to an enquiry into the &s;ituation of that young gentleman. She heard the particulars I have formerly related, with an emotion not &s;uited to the feelings of Mi&s;s Sindall; and the &s;incerity of her friend&s;hip declared the fears which her prudence &s;ugge&s;ted&punc;</P>
<P>She reminded Lucy of the dangers to which youth and inexperi|ence are expo&s;ed, by the &s;udden acqui&s;ition of riches; &s;he &s;et forth the many di&s;advantages of early independance, and hinted the incon&s;tancy of attachments, formed in the period of romantic enthu&s;ia&s;m, in the &s;cenes of rural &s;implicity, which are afterwards to be tried by the maxims of the world, amid&s;t the &s;ociety of the gay, the thoughtle&s;s, and the di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>From all this followed conclu&s;ions, which it was as difficult as di&s;agreeable for the heart of Lucy to form: it could not untwi&s;t tho&s;e tender ties which linked it to Bolton; but it began to trem|ble for it&s;elf and him.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Certain opinions of Mrs. Boothby. &mdash; An attempt to account for them.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the particulars of her own &s;tory, and of Bolton's, Mrs. Boothby drew one conclu&s;ion common to both; to wit, the goodne&s;s of &s;ir Thomas Sindall. This indeed, a laudable gratitude had &s;o much impre&s;&s;ed on her mind, that the prai&s;es &s;he frequently be&s;towed on him, even in his own pre&s;ence, would have favored of adulation to one, who had not known the debt which this lady owed to his beneficence.</P>
<P>Lucy, to whom &s;he would often repeat her eulogium of the baronet, was ready enough to own the obligations her&s;elf had re|ceived, and to join her acknowlegements to tho&s;e of her friend. Yet there was a want of warmth in her panegyric, for which Mrs. Boothby would &s;ometimes gently blame her; and one day, when they were on that &s;ubject, &s;he remarked, with a &s;ort of jocular air, the difference of that attachment which Mi&s;s Sindall felt, in return for &s;o much unwearied kindne&s;s as &s;ir Thomas had &s;hown her, and that which a few &s;oft glances had procured to the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fortunate Mr. Bolton.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="018007_0125_0FA455A14D607BF8">Mi&s;s Sindall &s;eemed to feel the ob&s;ervation with &s;ome degree of di&s;plea&s;ure; and an&s;wered, blu&s;hing, that &s;he con&s;idered &s;ir Thomas as a parent whom &s;he was to e&s;teem and revere, not as one for whom &s;he was to entertain any &s;entiments of a &s;ofter kind.</P>
<P>"But &s;uppo&s;e, replied the other, that he &s;hould entertain &s;entiments of a &s;ofter kind for you."&mdash;"I cannot &s;uppo&s;e it." &mdash;"There you are in the wrong&punc; men of &s;en&s;e and knowlege of the world, like &s;ir Thomas, are not &s;o prodigal of unmeanig compliment as giddy young people, who mean not half of what they &s;ay; but they feel more deeply the force of our attractions, and will retain the impre&s;&s;ion &s;o much the longer as it is grafted on maturity of judgment. I am very much mi&s;taken, Mi&s;s Lucy, if the worthie&s;t of men is not your lover."&mdash;"Lover! &s;ir Thomas Sindall my lover!"&mdash;"I profe&s;s, my dear, I cannot &s;ee the rea&s;on of that pa&s;&s;ionate exclamation; nor why that man &s;hould not be entitled to love you, who has him&s;elf the be&s;t title to be beloved." &mdash;"I may reverence &s;ir Thomas Sindall, I may admire his good|ne&s;s; I will do any thing to &s;how my gratitude to him; but to love him&mdash;good heavens!" There is, I know, rejoined Mrs. Boothby, a certain romantic affection, which young people &s;uppo&s;e to be the only thing that comes under that denomination. From being accu&s;|tomed to admire a &s;et of opinion's, which they term &s;entimental, oppo&s;ed to others which they look upon as vulgar and unfeeling, they form to them&s;elves an ideal &s;y&s;tem in tho&s;e matters, which, from the nature of things, mu&s;t always be di&s;appointed. You will find, Mi&s;s Sindall, when you have lived to &s;ee a little more of the world; the in&s;ufficiency of tho&s;e vi&s;ionary articles of happine&s;s, that are &s;et forth with &s;uch parade of language in novels and romances, as con&s;i&s;ting in &s;ympathy of &s;oul, and the mutual attraction of hearts, de&s;tined for each other."</P>
<P>"You will pardon me, &s;aid Lucy, for making one ob&s;ervation, that you your&s;elf are an in&s;tance again&s;t the univer&s;al truth of your argument; you married for love, Mrs. Boothby."&mdash;"I did &s;o, in|terrupted &s;he, and therefore I am the better able to inform you of the &s;hort duration of that paradi&s;e &s;uch a &s;tate is &s;uppo&s;ed to imply. We were looked upon, Mi&s;s Lucy, as patterns of conjugal felicity; but folks did little know, how &s;oon the raptures with which we went together were changed into feelings of a much colder kind. At the &s;ame time, Mr. Boothby was a good-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atured man; and, I believe, we were on a better footing than mo&s;t of your couples who marry for love are at the end of a twelvemonth. I am now but too well convinced that tho&s;e are the happie&s;t matches which are founded on the &s;obe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er &s;entiments of gratitude and e&s;teem."</P>
<P>To this concluding maxim Lucy made no reply. It was one of tho&s;e which &s;he could not ea&s;ily bear to believe; it even tinctured the character of the per&s;on who made i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;he found her&s;elf not &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to love Mrs. Boothby as &s;he once had been.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="018007_0126_0FA455A1CDB66BF8">For this &s;ort of rea&s;oning, however, that lady had rea&s;ons which it may not be improper to explain to the reader, if indeed the reader has not already di&s;covered them without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of explanation.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Sindall, though he was now verging towards that time of life when
<Q>the heyday of the blood is tame,</Q>
was &s;till as &s;u&s;ceptible as ever of the influence of beauty. Mi&s;s Lucy I have already mentioned as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an uncommon &s;hare of it; and chance had placed her &s;o immediately under his ob&s;ervation and guardian&s;hip, that it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for him not to remark, and having remarked, not to de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>In &s;ome minds indeed there might have ari&s;en &s;ugge&s;tions of honour and con&s;cience unfavorable to the u&s;e of that opportunity which fortune had put in his power; but the&s;e were re&s;traints which &s;ir Thomas had &s;o frequently broken, as in a great mea&s;ure to annihilate their force.</P>
<P>During the life of his aunt, there were other motives to re&s;train him; tho&s;e were now removed; and being &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve the advantage which he drew from Mi&s;s Sindall's re&s;idence in his hou&s;e, he pitched on Mrs. Boothby to fill Mrs. Selwyn's place, from whom his former good offices gave him an additional title to expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by means of the influence &s;he would naturally gain over the mind of one who was in &s;ome &s;ort to become her ward.</P>
<P>As I am willing at pre&s;ent to believe that lady' character a fair one, I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, that he concealed from her the kind of ad|dre&s;&s;es with which he meant to approach her young friend. It is certain there was but one kind, which the principles of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r Tho|mas allowed him to make.</P>
<P>One ob&s;tacle however he fore&s;aw in the attachment which he had early di&s;covered her to have towards Bolton. This, on the mo&s;t favourable &s;uppo&s;ition of the ca&s;e, he might ea&s;ily repre&s;ent to Mrs. Boothby, equally hurtful to Lucy's intere&s;t, and de&s;tructive of his own wi&s;hes; and if &s;he was prevailed on to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, it may account for tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons of prudence which &s;he be&s;towed upon Mi&s;s Sindall.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the baronet did not &s;cruple to u&s;e &s;ome other me|thods, &s;till more di&s;honourable of &s;haking her confidence in his cou&s;in. He fell upon means of &s;ecretly intercepting that young gentleman's letters to Lucy; from this he drew a double advantage; both of fa&s;tening a &s;u&s;picion on Harry's fidelity, and acquiring &s;uch intelligence as might point his own machinations to defeat the purpo&s;es which that corre&s;pondence contained.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. A di&s;covery intere&s;ting to Mi&s;s Sindall.</HEAD>
<P>UNDER tho&s;e circum&s;tances of advantage in which &s;ir Thomas Sindall &s;tood, it did not &s;eem a matter of extreme difficulty to accompli&s;h that de&s;ign which I have hinted to my readers in the preceding chapter. Let him, who&s;e indignation is rou&s;ed at the mention of it, carry his feelings abroad into life; he will find other Sindalls whom the world has not marked with its di&s;plea&s;ure: in the &s;implicity of my narrative, what is there that &s;hould &s;et up this one to his hatred or his &s;corn? let but the heart pronounce its judgment, and the deci&s;ion will be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Hitherto &s;ir Thomas had appeared as the parent and guardian of Lucy; and though, at times, certain expre&s;&s;ions e&s;caped him, which the quickne&s;s of more experienced, that is, le&s;s innocent minds would have di&s;covered to belong to another character, yet &s;he, to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, had heard them without &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>But &s;he was now alarmed by the &s;ugge&s;tions of Mrs. Boothby: the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions it is po&s;&s;ible the baronet him&s;elf had prompted. He knew the force of that poi&s;on which is conveyed in tho&s;e indirect approaches, when a woman's vanity is &s;et on the watch by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a third per&s;on. She who imagines &s;he hears them with indifference, is in danger; but &s;he who li&s;tens to them with plea&s;ure, is undone.</P>
<P>With Lucy, however, they failed of that effect which the baronet's experience had promi&s;ed him: &s;he heard them with a &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of di&s;gu&s;t at Mrs. Boothby, and &s;omething like fear of &s;ir Thomas.</P>
<P>Her unea&s;ine&s;s encrea&s;ed as his declarations began to be more p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inted, though they were then only &s;uch as &s;ome women, who had meant to give them no favorable ear, might perhaps have been rather flattered than di&s;plea&s;ed with; but Mi&s;s Sindall was equally void of the art by which we di&s;gui&s;e our own &s;entiments, and the pride we a&s;&s;ume from the &s;entiments of others.</P>
<P>To her virtues &s;ir Thomas was no &s;tranger; they were difficul|ties watch &s;erved but as &s;purs in his pur&s;uit: that he continued it with encrea&s;ing ardor, may be gathered from two letters, which I &s;ubjoin for the information of the reader. The fir&s;t is addre&s;&s;ed</P>

<P>Nor is this all. &mdash; La&s;t night I was &s;itting in the parlour with him and Mrs. Boothby, (of wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I have much to tell you) I got up, and &s;tood in the bow-window, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">king at the rays of the moon which glittered on the pond in the garden.

<P>"What's the matter?" &s;aid Mrs. Boothby, who then entered the room; "a mou&s;e running acro&s;s the carpet, frightened Mi&s;s Lucy," an&s;wered &s;ir Thomas; I could not &s;peak, but I &s;at down on the &s;ofa, and had almo&s;t fainted.

<P>Is it true, that amid&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s, or the plea&s;ures of his new &s;ituation, Harry Bolton has forgotten Lucy Sindall?

<P>But perhaps, though I do not hear from you, you may yet remember her, to whom you had once &s;ome fooli&s;h attatchment. It is fit that you think of her no more; &s;he was then indeed a dependant orphan, but there was a &s;mall challenge of protection from friends to whom it was imagined her infancy had been entru&s;ted. Know, that this was a fabricated tale; &s;he is, in truth, a wretched &s;oundling, expo&s;ed in her infant-&s;tate by the cruelty or nece&s;&s;ity of her parents, to the inclemency of a winter-&s;torm, from which mi&s;erable &s;ituation &s;ir Thomas Sindall delivered her.

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. She receives a letter from Bolton.&mdash;A new alarm from &s;ir Thomas Sindall.</HEAD>
<P>IT happened that the me&s;&s;enger to whom the charge of the fore|going billet was committed, was a per&s;on, not in that line of a&s;&s;ociation which the baronet had drawn around her; con&s;equent|ly it e&s;caped interception.</P>
<P>When Bolton received it, he was not only alarmed with the in|telligence it contained, but his fears were doubly rou&s;ed from the di&s;covery it made to him, of his letters not being &s;uffered to reach Mi&s;s Sindall. He di&s;patched his an&s;wer, therefore, by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger, who was ordered to watch an opportunity of delivering it privately into the hands of the lady to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. This he found no ea&s;y matter to accompli&s;h; nor would he per|haps have been able to effect it at all, but for an artifice to which he had recour&s;e, of hiring him&s;elf on a job in &s;ir Thomas's garden, for which his knowlege in the bu&s;ine&s;s happened to qualify him. He had indeed been formerly employed in that capacity at Sindall-Park, and had there been well enough known to Mi&s;s Lucy, who was her&s;elf a gardener for amu&s;ement; and, after leaving that place, having gone to the neighbourhood of London for improve|ment, he was met, and hired by his former acquaintance, Mr. Bolton.</P>
<P>The very next evening after he had got into this &s;tation, he ob|&s;erved Mi&s;s Sindall enter the garden alone. This was an opportu|nity not to be mi&s;&s;ed; on pretence, therefore, of fetching &s;ome|what from the end of the walk &s;he was on, he pa&s;&s;ed her, and pulled off his hat with a look &s;ignificant of prior acquaintance. Lucy ob&s;erved him, and feeling a &s;ort of momentary comfort from the recollection, began &s;ome talk with him re&s;pecting his former &s;ituation, and the changes it had undergone.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked him many que&s;tions about their old neighbours at Sindall-Park, and particularly Mrs. Wi&s;tanly; when &s;he was &s;oon convinced of her mi&s;apprehen&s;ion with regard to a failure of that worthy woman's intellects, Jerry, (&s;o the gardener was famili|arly called) having &s;een her in his way to Bil&s;wood, and heard her &s;peak of Mi&s;s Lucy with the mo&s;t tender concern. "And what was your la&s;t &s;ervice, Jerry?" &s;aid &s;he&mdash;"I wrought for Mr.
<PB N="37" REF="018007_0131_0FA455A8D01460F8">
Bolton, Madam."&mdash;"Mr. Bolton!"&mdash;"And I received this paper from him for your Lady&s;hip, which I was ordered to deliver into your own hands, and no other body's, an't plea&s;e your lady|&s;hip." She took the letter with a trembling impatience, and whi&s;pering, that &s;he would find an opportunity of &s;eeing him again, hurried up into her chamber to peru&s;e it. She found it to contain what follows:</P>
<P>"I have not words to tell my ever deare&s;t Lucy, with what di&s;tracting anxiety I read, the letter that is now lying before me. To give her &s;u&s;picions of my faith, mu&s;t have been the work of no common treachery: when &s;he knows that I wrote to her three &s;everal times without receiving any an&s;wer, &s;he will, at the &s;ame time, acquit me of incon&s;tancy, and judge of my unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"That di&s;covery which &s;he has lately made, is nothing to her or to me. My Lucy is the child of heaven, and her inheritance every excellence it can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>"But her pre&s;ent &s;ituation&mdash;my God! what horrible images has my fancy drawn of it! For heaven's &s;ake, let not even the mo&s;t amiable of weakne&s;&s;es prevent her e&s;caping from it into the arms of her faithful Bolton. I di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger with this in&s;tantly. I cannot po&s;&s;ibly follow him my&s;elf &s;ooner than two days hence. I will then &s;et out for the neighbourhood of Bil&s;wood. That hou&s;e I am forbidden to enter, &s;ir Thomas having taken occa&s;ion, from my re&s;igning a commi&s;&s;ion which would have fixed me ingloriou&s;ly in a garri&s;on abroad, that I might be of &s;ome u&s;e to my country at home, to write me a letter in the angried terms, renouncing me, as he expre&s;&s;es it, for ever. I &s;ee, I &s;ee, the villainy of his purpo&s;e; 'tis but a few days hence, and I will meet him in the covert of his fal&s;ehood and bla&s;t it. Let my Lucy be but ju&s;t to her&s;elf and to BOLTON."</P>
<P>She had &s;carcely read this, when Mrs. Boothby entered the room. The baronet had, for &s;ome days, quitted that plan of intimidation, which had prompted him to di&s;cover to Lucy, the circum&s;tance of her being a wretched foundling, &s;upported by his charity, for a behaviour more mild and in&s;inuating; and Mrs. Boothby, who &s;qared her conduct accordingly, had been particularly attentive and obliging.</P>
<P>She now delivered to Mi&s;s Sindall a me&s;&s;age from a young lady in the neighbourhood, an acquaintance of hers, begging her company, along with Mrs. Boothby's, to a party of plea&s;ure the day after. "And really Mi&s;s Sindall," &s;aid &s;he, with an air of concern, "I mu&s;t enforce the invitation from a regard to your health, as you &s;eem to have been drooping for &s;ome days pa&s;t." Lucy looked her full in the face, and &s;igned: that look &s;he did not chu&s;e to under&s;tand, but repeated her que&s;tion as to their jaunt to-morrow. "Mi&s;s Venhur&s;t will call at nine, and expects to find you ready to attend her."&mdash;"What you plea&s;e," replied the other; "if Mi&s;s Venhur&s;t is to be of the party, I have no
<PB N="38" REF="018007_0132_0FA455A933FC26B8">
objection." The con&s;ent &s;eemed to give much &s;atisfaction to Mrs. Boothby, who left her with a gentle tap on the back, and an unu&s;ual appearance of kindne&s;s in her a&s;pect.</P>
<P>Lucy read her letter again; &s;he had de&s;ired Bolton to think of her no more; but there is in the worthie&s;t hearts, a little hypocri&s;y attending &s;uch reque&s;ts: &s;he found her&s;elf happy in the thought that he had not forgotten her</P>
<P>When &s;he opened her bureau, to depo&s;it this fre&s;h te&s;timony of his attachment, &s;he ob&s;erverd the corner of a piece of paper which had been thru&s;t into a fi&s;&s;ure occa&s;ioned by the &s;hrinking of the wood. Her curio&s;ity was excited by this circum&s;tance, and un|folding the paper, &s;he found it to contain&mdash;</P>

<P>Amazement and horror filled the mind of Lucy as &s;he read this; but&punc; when the fir&s;t perturbation of her &s;oul was over, &s;he bethought her&s;elf of endeavouring to find out her friend in the author of this epi&s;tle, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed &s;o much intere&s;ted in her behalf.

At &s;upper, therefore, tho' &s;he wore a look of as much indifference as po&s;&s;ible, &s;he marked, with a &s;ecret attention the appearance of this man's countenance. Her belief, of his being the per&s;on who had communicated this friendly intelligence, was encrea&s;ed from her ob&s;ervation; and &s;he determined to watch an opportunity of que&s;tioning him with regard to it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Mi&s;s Sindall has an interview with Robert. &mdash; A re&s;olution &s;he takes in con&s;equence of it.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a night of wakeful anxiety, &s;he was called in the morning by Mrs. Boothby, who told her, that breakfa&s;t waited, as it was near the hour they propo&s;ed &s;etting out on their jaunt. "Mi&s;s Venhur&s;t, continued &s;he, has &s;ent to let you know, that &s;he is prevented from calling here as &s;he promi&s;ed, but that

&s;he will meet us on the road."&mdash;"I am &s;orry," an&s;wered Lucy, with a counterfeited coolne&s;s, "that I &s;hould be forced to di&s;ap|point her in my turn; but I re&s;ted &s;o ill la&s;t night, and my head+akes &s;o violently that I cannot po&s;&s;ibly attend her."&mdash;"Not go!" exclaimed Mrs. Boothby; "why, my dear, you will di&s;|joint the whole party; be&s;ides, I have not time to acquaint the Venhur&s;t family, and it will look &s;o odd."&mdash;"It would look odder, &s;aid Lucy, if I &s;hould go abroad when I am really &s;o very much indi&s;po&s;ed." "Nay, if you are <HI>really</HI> &s;o much indi&s;po&s;ed," an&s;wered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">the other, "I will &s;end our apology, late as it is."&mdash; "But you &s;hall not &s;tay at home to attend me," interrupted Lucy. "Indeed but I &s;hall," replied Mrs. Boothby: "it was on your account only that I propo&s;ed going. Keep your chamber, and I will &s;end you up &s;ome tea immediately." &mdash; And &s;he left the room for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Her attention indeed was but too vigilant for the &s;cheme which Lucy had formed of examining Robert about that note &s;he had found in her bureau; but accident at la&s;t furni&s;hed her with the opportunity &s;he &s;ought. Mrs. Boothby having left her, in order to pre&s;ide at dinner, &s;ent this very &s;ervant, with a plate of &s;ome|thing to her patient above &s;tairs.

<P>The fellow blu&s;hed, and &s;tammered, and &s;eemed afraid to con|fe&s;s his kindne&s;s. "For God's &s;ake, &s;aid Lucy, do not trifle with my mi&s;ery; there is no time to lo&s;e in eva&s;ions; what do you know of &s;ir Thomas's de&s;igns again&s;t me!"&mdash;"Why for certain, Madam, &s;aid he, &s;ervants &s;hould not blab their ma&s;ter's &s;ecrets; but your lady&s;hip is &s;o &s;weet a lady, that I could not bear to &s;ee you &s;o deceived.</P>
<P>"Sir Thomas's valet de chamb is a chum of mine, and he told me, after having made me promi&s;e to keep it a profound &s;ecret&punc; that his ma&s;ter de&s;igned to entice you on a party with Mrs. Booth|by; that they were to &s;top at a &s;olitary farm hou&s;e of his, and there &s;ir Thomas" &mdash;" Forbear the &s;hocking recital," cried Lucy.</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure it is &s;hocking, &s;aid Robert, and &s;o I &s;aid to Jem, when he told me; but he an&s;wered (your lady&s;hip will forgive me for repeating his words) that it mattered not much; for &s;he is nothing better, &s;aid he, than a beggarly foundling, whom my ma&s;ter and I picked up, one &s;tormy night, on the road, near his hunting-place there at hazleden; and, having taken a liking to the child, he brought her home to Mrs. Selwyn&punc; pretending, that &s;he was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the daughter of a gentleman of his own name, a friend of his who died abroad; and his aunt, believing the &s;tory, brought

<P>"Would that I were begging my bread, &s;o I were but out of this&punc; frightful hou&s;e."

"Gracious God! cried Lucy, whither &s;hall I turn me?&mdash;Robert, if ever thou would'&s;t find grace with heaven, pity a wretch that knows not where to look for protection!" She had thrown her&s;elf on her knees before him.&mdash;"What can I do for your lady&s;hip?" &s;aid he, rai&s;ing her from the ground; "Take me from this dreadful place," &s;he exclaimed, holding by the &s;leeve of his coat, as if &s;he feared his leaving her.</P>
<P>"Alas! an&s;wered Robert, I cannot take you from it."&mdash;She &s;tood for &s;ome moments rapt in thought, the fellow looking piteou&s;ly in her face.

"Look here, Robert, look here; could I not get, from this window on the garden-wall, and &s;o leap down into the outer court."&mdash;</P>
<P>"But &s;uppo&s;ing your lady&s;hip might, what would you do then?" &mdash;"Could not you procure me a hor&s;e?"&mdash;"Stay&mdash;there is one of the chai&s;e-hor&s;es at gra&s;s in the paddock &mdash;do you know the road to Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's!" &mdash; "Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's!" &mdash; "For hea|ven's &s;ake refu&s;e not my reque&s;t; you cannot be &s;o cruel as to re|fu&s;e it" "I would do much to &s;erve your lady&s;hip; but if they &s;hould di&s;cover us"&mdash;"Talk not of if's, my dear Robert;"&mdash;but &s;oft&mdash;I will manage it thus&mdash;no, that can't be either&mdash;the &s;ervants are in bed by eleven."

The fir&s;t part of his bu&s;ine&s;s the reader has &s;een him accompli&s;h; as to the re&s;t, he was only able to learn &s;omething confu&s;edly, of the baronet's at|tachment to Mi&s;s Lucy.</P>
<P>He expected to have &s;een that young lady again on the day following that of their fir&s;t interview; but her attention had been &s;o much occupied by the di&s;coveries related in the two la&s;t chapters, and contriving the means of avoiding the danger with which &s;he was threatened, that her promi&s;e to the bearer of Mr. Bolton's letter had e&s;caped her memory. He &s;et out therefore for the place of appointment on the evening of that day, and reached it but a very &s;hort time before his ma&s;ter arrived.</P>
<P>Bolton, having learned what particulars Jerry could inform him of, de&s;ired him to return in the morning to his work in &s;ir Tho|mas's garden, and remain there till he &s;hould receive farther or|ders; then leaving his hor&s;es and &s;ervants for fear of di&s;covery, he &s;et out on foot, in the garb of a pea&s;ant, which Jerry had found means to procure him.</P>
<P>As he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years of his life at Bil&s;wood, he tru&s;ted implicitly to his own knowledge of the way; but &s;oon after his leaving the inn the moon was totally darkened, and it rained with &s;uch violence, accompanied with ince&s;&s;ant peals of thunder, that, in the confu&s;ion of the &s;cene, he mi&s;&s;ed his path, and had wander|ed a great way over the adjacent common before he di&s;covered his mi&s;take.</P>
<P>When he endeavoured to regain the road, he found him&s;elf en|tangled in a very thick brake of furze, which happened to lie on that &s;ide whence he had turned; and, after &s;everal fruitle&s;s efforts to make his way through it, he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t from the at|tempt, and tread back the &s;teps he had made, till he returned to the open part of the heath.</P>
<P>Here he &s;tood, uncertain what cour&s;e to take; when he ob&s;erv|ed at a di&s;tance the twinkling of a light, which immediately deter|mined him. On advancing &s;omewhat nearer, he found a little winding track that &s;eemed to point towards the place; and after following it &s;ome time, he could di&s;cern an object which he took for the hou&s;e to which it led.</P>
<P>The lightening, which now fla&s;hed around him, di&s;covered on each hand the earth rai&s;ed into mounds that &s;eemed graves of the dead, and here and there a bone lay mouldering on the walk he trod. A few paces farther, through a narrow gothic door, gleam|ed a light, which faintly illuminated a length of vault within. To this Bolton approached, not without &s;ome degree of fear; when he perceived at the farther end a per&s;on, in a military uniform, &s;it|ting

by a fire he had made of &s;ome withered bru&s;h-wood piled up again&s;t the wall. As Harry approached him the echo of the place doubled the hollow &s;ound of his feet.&mdash;"Who is there?" cried the &s;tranger, turning at the noi&s;e, and half un&s;heathing a hanger which he wore at his &s;ide.</P>
<P>"A friend," replied Harry, bowing, "who takes the liberty of begging a &s;eat by your fire." "Your manner, &s;aid the other, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elies your garb; but whoever you are, you are welcome to what &s;helter this roof can afford, and what warmth my fire can give. We are, for the time, joint lords of the man&s;ion, for my title is no other than the inclemency of the night. It is &s;uch a one as makes even this gloomy &s;helter enviable; and that broken piece of mat|tock, and this Hint, are precious, becau&s;e they lighted &s;ome bits of dry &s;traw, to kindle the flame that warms us.</P>
<P>By the mo&s;s-grown altar, and the frequent figures of the cro&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e the remains of &s;ome chapel devoted to ancient vene|ration. Sit down on this &s;tone, if you plea&s;e, &s;ir, and our offer|ing &s;hall be a thankful heart over &s;ome humble fare which my knap&s;ack contains."</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he pulled out a loaf of coar&s;e bread, a piece of chee&s;e, and a bottle of ale. Bolton expre&s;&s;ed his thanks for the invitation, and partook of the repa&s;t. "I fear, &s;ir," &s;aid his companion, "you will be poorly &s;upped; but I have known what it is, to want even a cru&s;t of bread.&mdash;You look at me with &s;urprize; but, though I am poor, I am hone&s;t." Pardon me," an&s;wered Harry, "I entertain no &s;u&s;picion; there is &s;omething that &s;peaks for you in this bo&s;om, and an&s;wers for your worth. It may be in my power to prevent, for the future, tho&s;e hard&s;hips which, I fear, you have formerly endured."&mdash;</P>
<P>The &s;oldier held forth the bit of bread which he was putting to his mouth&mdash;"He, to whom this fare is luxury, can &s;carcely be dependant; yet my gratitude to you, &s;ir, is equally due; &mdash; if I have felt misfortune, I have de&s;erved it." &mdash; He &s;ighed, and Harry an&s;wered him with a &s;igh.&mdash;"I &s;ee a &s;ort of que&s;tion in your face, &s;ir; and, I know not why it is, there are &s;ome faces I cannot ea&s;ily re&s;i&s;t.

<P>"IT is now upwards of twenty years &s;ince I left my native country. You are too young, &s;ir, to have gained much knowlege of mankind; let me warn you, from &s;ad experience, to beware of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which at your age I was unable to re&s;i&s;t, and which, in the commerce of the world, will find abundant occa&s;ion to overcome incautious and unexperienced youth.

not when I tell you, that you &s;ee before you one whom the laws of his country had doomed to expiate his crimes by death, though from the mercy of his prince, that judgment was mitigated into a term of tran&s;portation &s;ome time ago elap&s;ed. This puni&s;hment I incurred from the commi&s;&s;ion of a Robbery, to which &s;ome par|ticular circum&s;tances, joined to the poverty con&s;equent on di&s;&s;ipati|on and extravagance, had tempted me.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter to whom my &s;ervice was adjudged in the We&s;t-Indies happened to die &s;oon after my arrival there. I got my freedom therefore, though it was but to change it for a &s;ervice as &s;evere as my former; I was enli&s;ted in a regiment then &s;tationed in the i&s;land, and being con&s;idered as a felon, unworthy of any mild treatment, was con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to every hard&s;hip which the &s;tricte&s;t duty, or the mo&s;t continual expo&s;ure to the dangers of the climate, could inflict.</P>
<P>Had I revealed my &s;tory, and taken advantage of that di&s;tinction which my birth and education would have made between the other convicts and me, it is probable I might have prevented mo&s;t of the evils both of my former and pre&s;ent &s;ituation; but I &s;et out, from the fir&s;t, with a fixed determination, of &s;uffering every part of my puni&s;hment, which the law allots to the meane&s;t and mo&s;t unfriend|ed. All the &s;everities, therefore, which were now impo&s;ed upon me, I bore without repining; and, from an excellent natural con|&s;titution, was not only able to overcome them, but they &s;erved to render me &s;till more patient of fatigue, and le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ion from the vici&s;&s;itudes of the weather; and from a &s;ullen di&s;regard of life, with which the remembrance of better days in&s;pired me, my &s;oul became as fearle&s;s as my body robu&s;t. The&s;e qualities made me be taken notice of by &s;ome of the officers in the regiment, and afterwards, when it was ordered to America, and went on &s;ome Indian expeditions, were &s;till more &s;erviceable and more attractive of ob&s;ervation</P>
<P>By the&s;e means I began to obliterate the di&s;grace which my &s;ituation at enli&s;ting had fixed upon me; and, if &s;till regarded as a ruffian, I was at lea&s;t acknowleged to be a u&s;eful one. Not long after, on occa&s;ion of a piece of &s;ervice I performed for an officer on an advanced guard, that was attacked by a party of ho&s;tile Indians, I was promoted to a halberd. The &s;tigma, however, of my tran&s;portation was not yet entirely forgotten, and by &s;ome it was the better remembered becau&s;e of my pre&s;ent advancement. One of tho&s;e, with whom I had never been on good terms, was parti|cularly offended at being commanded, as he termed it, by a jail|bird; and one day, when I was on guard, had drawn on the back of my coat, the picture of a gallows, on which was hung a figure in caricature, with the initials of my name written over it. This was an affront too gro&s;s to be tamely put up; having &s;ought out the man, who did not deny the charge&punc; I challenged him to give me &s;atisfaction by fighting me. But this, from the opinion con|ceived of my &s;trength and ferocity, he did not chu&s;e to accept;
<PB N="45" REF="018007_0139_0FA455B2B4136BC0">
on which I gave him &s;o &s;evere a drubbing, that he was unable to mount guard in his turn, and the &s;urgeon reported that his life was in danger. For this offence I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied by a court-martial, and &s;entenced to receive five hundred la&s;hes as a puni&s;hment. When their &s;entence was communicated to me, I petitioned that it might be changed into death; but my reque&s;t was refu&s;ed. That very day, therefore, I received one hundred la&s;hes, (for the &s;en|tence was to be executed at different periods) and next morning was to &s;uffer as many more.</P>
<P>The remainder however I re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to e&s;cape by an act of &s;uicide. This I was only prevented from putting in execution by the want of opportunity; as I had been &s;tripped of every the &s;malle&s;t weapon of offence, and was bound with ropes to one of the po&s;ts of my bed. I contrived, neverthele&s;s, about midnight, to reach the fire place with my feet, and having drawn out thence a live ember, di&s;po&s;ed it immediately under the mo&s;t combu&s;tible part of the bed.</P>
<P>It had very &s;oon the effect I de&s;ired; the room was &s;et on fire, and I regained my liberty, by the ropes, with which I was tied, being burnt. At that moment the de&s;ire of life was rekindled by the po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping: the flames bur&s;ting out fiercely at one &s;ide of the hou&s;e where I lay, the attention of the &s;oldiers whom the fire had awaked, was principally turned to that quarter, and I had an opportunity of &s;tealing off unperceived at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide.</P>
<P>We were then in a &s;ort of wooden huts which had been built for our accommodation on the out&s;ide of one of our frontier-forts; for that, when I had run two or three hundred yard, I found my&s;elf in the &s;helter of a wood, pretty &s;ecure from pur&s;uit; but, as there it was impo&s;&s;ible for me long to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and I had no chance of e&s;caping detection if I ventured to approach the habitations of any of my countrymen, I formed the re&s;olution of endeavouring to join the Indians, who&s;e &s;couting parties I had frequently &s;een at a &s;mall di&s;tance from our out-po&s;ts.</P>
<P>I held therefore in a direction which I judged the mo&s;t probable for falling in with them, and a very little after day-break di&s;cover|ed a party, &s;eated after the manner of their country, in a ring, with the a&s;hes of their newly-extingui&s;hed fire in the middle. I advanced &s;lowly to the place, which I had almo&s;t reached before I was perceived. When they di&s;covered me, they leaped up to their feet, and &s;eizing their arms, &s;creamed out the war-whoop, to al|arm the different &s;mall parties who had pa&s;&s;ed the night in re&s;ting places near them.</P>
<P>One of them pre&s;enting his piece took aim at me; but I fell on my knees, &s;howed them my defencele&s;s &s;tate, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld out my hands, as if imploring their mercy and protection. Upon this one of the olde&s;t among them made a &s;ign to the re&s;t, and advancing towards me, a&s;ked me, in broken French, mixed with his own language, of which too I under&s;tood &s;omething, what was my in|tention,
<PB N="46" REF="018007_0140_0FA455B419221500">
and whence I came? I an&s;wered as di&s;tinctly as I could to the&s;e interrogatories; and &s;howing the &s;ores on my back, which I gave him to under&s;tand had been inflicted at the fort, made pro|te&s;tations, both by imperfect language and &s;ignificant ge&s;tures, of my friend&s;hip to his countrymen and hatred to my own. After holding a moment's conver&s;ation with the re&s;t, he took my hand, and, leading me a little forward, placed me in the mid&s;t of the party.</P>
<P>Some of them examined me attentively, and upon &s;ome farther di&s;cour&s;e together, brought the baggage, with which two pri&s;oners, lately made from &s;ome adver&s;e tribe, had been loaded, and laid it upon me. This burden, which to any man would have been op|pre&s;&s;ively heavy, you may believe, was much more intolerable to me, who&s;e fle&s;h was yet raw from the la&s;hes I had received; but as I knew that fortitude was an indi&s;pen&s;able virtue with the Indians, I bore it without wincing, and we proceeded on the rout which the party I had joined were de&s;tined to pur&s;ue. During the cour&s;e of our fir&s;t day's march, they often looked &s;tedfa&s;tly in my face, to di&s;cover if I &s;howed any &s;igns of unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When they &s;aw that I did not, they lightened my load by de|grees, and at la&s;t, the &s;enior chief, who had fir&s;t taken notice of me, freed me from it altogether, and, at the &s;ame time, chewing &s;ome herbs he found in the wood, applied them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my &s;ores, which in a few days were almo&s;t entirely healed. I was then en|tru&s;ted with a tomahawk, and &s;hortly after with a gun, to the dexterous u&s;e of both which weapons I was frequently exerci&s;ed by the young men of our party, during the remainder of our expedi|tion.</P>
<P>It la&s;ted &s;ome months, in which time I had al&s;o become tolerably acquainted with their language. At the end of this excur&s;ion, in which they warred on &s;ome other Indian nations, they returned to their own country, and were received with all the barbarous de|mon&s;trations of joy peculiar to that people. In a day or two after their arrival, their pri&s;oners were brought forth into a large plain, where the kindred of tho&s;e who had been &s;lain by the nations to which the captives belonged, a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>Each &s;ingled out his expiatory pri&s;oner, and having taken him home to his hut, &s;uch as cho&s;e that kind of &s;atisfaction, adopted them in place of the relations they had lo&s;t; with the re&s;t they returned to their former place of meeting, and began to celebrate the fe&s;tival of their reve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge. You can hardly conceive a &s;pecies of inventive cruelty, which they did not inflict on the wretches whom fortune had thus put into their power; during the cour&s;e of which, not a groan e&s;caped from the &s;ufferers; but while the u&s;e of their voices remained, they &s;ung, in their rude, yet forcible manner, the glory of their former victories, and the plea&s;ure they had received from the death of their foes; concluding always with the hopes of revenge from the &s;urviving warriors of their nation. Nor was it only for the plea&s;ure of the reflexion that they carolled thus
<PB N="47" REF="018007_0141_0FA455B487FEB120">
the triumphs of the pa&s;t; for I could ob&s;erve, that, when at any time the rage of their tormentors &s;eemed to &s;ub&s;ide, they poured forth tho&s;e boa&s;tful &s;trains in order to rekindle their fury, that inten&s;ene&s;s of pain might not be wanting in the trial of their fortitude. I perceived the old man whom I have before mentioned, keep his eye fixed upon me during this inhuman &s;olemnity: and frequently, when an extreme degree of torture was born with that calmne&s;s which I have de&s;cribed, he would point, with an expre&s;&s;ive look, to him on whom it was inflicted, as if he had de&s;ired me to take particular notice of his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>I did not then fully comprehend the meaning of this; but I afterwards under&s;tood it to have been a preparatory hint of what I my&s;elf was to endure; for the next morning, after the la&s;t &s;urviv|ing pri&s;oner had expired, I was &s;eized by three or four Indians, who &s;tripped me of what little cloaths I had then left, tied me in a horizontal po&s;ture between the branches of two large trees they had fixed in the ground, and, after the whole tribe had danced round me to the mu&s;ic of a barbarous howl, they began to re-act upon me, nearly the &s;ame &s;cene they had been engaged in the day before. After each of a certain &s;elect number had &s;tuck his knife into my body, though they carefully avoided any mortal wound, they rub|bed it over, bleeding as it was, with gun-powder, the &s;alts of which gave me the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain.</P>
<P>Nor did the ingenuity of the&s;e practi&s;ed tormentors &s;top here; they afterwards laid quantities of dry gun-powder on different parts of my body, and &s;et fire to them, by which I was burnt in &s;ome places to the bone. &mdash; But I &s;ee you &s;hudder at the horrid re|cital; &s;uffice it then to &s;ay, that the&s;e, and &s;ome other &s;uch ex|periments of wanton cruelty, I bore with that patience with which nothing but a life of hard&s;hip, and a certain obduracy of &s;pirit, proceeding from a contempt of exi&s;tence, could have endowed me.</P>
<P>"After this trial was over, I was loo&s;ed from my bonds, and &s;et in the mid&s;t of a circle, who &s;houted the cry of victory, and my aged friend brought me a bowl of water, mixed with &s;ome &s;pirits, to drink. He took me then home to his hut, and laid applicati|ons of different &s;imples to my mangled body.</P>
<P>"When I was &s;o well recovered as to be able to walk abroad, he called together certain elders of his tribe, and acknowleging me for his &s;on, gave me a name, and fa&s;tened round my neck a belt of wampum.
<Q>It is thus, &s;aid he, that the valiant are tried, and thus are they rewarded; for how &s;hould'&s;t thou be as one of us, if thy &s;oul were as the &s;oul of little men; he only is worthy to lift the hatchet with the Cherokees, to whom&punc; &s;hame is more intolerable than the &s;tab of the knife, or the burning of the fire.</Q></P>

<P>"<HI>IN</HI> this &s;ociety I lived till about a year and a half ago; and it may &s;eem extraordinary to declare&punc; yet it is certainly true, that during the life of the old man who had adopted me, even had there been no legal re&s;traint on my return to my native country, &s;carce any in|ducement could have tempted me to leave the nation to which he belong|ed, except perhaps the de&s;ire of revi&s;iting a parent, and a &s;i&s;ter, whom I had left in England &s;unk beneath that ignominy, which the &s;on and the brother had drawn on his guiltle&s;s connexions. When we con&s;i|der the perfect freedom &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in this rude and &s;imple &s;tate of &s;ociety, where rule is only acknowleged for the purpo&s;e of immediate utility to tho&s;e who obey, and cea&s;es whenever that purpo&s;e of &s;ubordination is accompli&s;hed; where greatne&s;s cannot u&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion, nor wealth excite envy; where the de&s;ires are native to the heart, and the langour of &s;atiety is unknown; where, if there is no refined &s;en&s;ation of delight, there is al&s;o no ideal &s;cource cf calamity; we &s;hall the le&s;s wonder at the inhabitants feeling no regret for the want of tho&s;e delicate plea&s;ures of which a more poli&s;hed people is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that I am far from being a &s;ingle in&s;tance, of one who had even attained maturity in Europe, and yet found his mind &s;o ac|commodated, by the habit of a few years, to Indian manners, as to leave that country with regret. The death of my parent by adoption loo&s;ened, indeed, my attachment to it; that event happened a &s;hort time before my departure from America.</P>
<P>"The compo&s;ure with which the old man met his di&s;&s;olution&punc; would have done honour to the firme&s;t philo&s;opher of antiquity. When he found him&s;elf near his end, he called me to him, to deliver &s;ome final in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ructions re&s;pecting my carriage to his countrymen; he ob&s;erved, at the clo&s;e of his di&s;cour&s;e, that I retained &s;o much of the European as to &s;hed &s;ome tears, while he delivered it.
<Q>In tho&s;e tears &s;aid he, there is no wi&s;dom, for there is no u&s;e; I have heard that, in your country, men prepare for death, by thinking on it while they live; this al&s;o is folly, becau&s;e it loo&s;es the good, by anticipating the evil; we do otherwi&s;e, my &s;on, as our fathers have better in|&s;tru&s;ted us, and take from the evil by reflecting on the good. I have lived a thou&s;and moons, without captivity, and without di&s;grace; in my youth I did not fly in battle, and in age, the tribes li&s;tened while I &s;pake. If I live in another land after death, I &s;hall remember the&s;e things with plea&s;ure; if the pre&s;ent is our only life, to have done thus is to have u&s;ed it well. You have &s;ometimes told me of your countrymen's account of a land of &s;ouls; but you were a young man when you came among us, and the cun|ning among them may have deceived you; for the children of the French king call them&s;elves after the &s;ame God that the Engli&s;h do&punc; yet their di&s;cour&s;es concerning him cannot be true, becau&s;e they are

oppo&s;ite one to another. Each &s;ays, that God &s;hall burn the others with fire; which could not happen if both were his children. Be&s;ides, neither of them act as the &s;ons of Truth, but as the &s;ons of Deceit; they &s;ay their God heareth all things, yet do they break the promi&s;es which they have called upon him to hear; but we know that the &s;pirit within us li&s;teneth, and what we have &s;aid in its hearing, that we do. If in another country the &s;oul liveth, this witne&s;s &s;hall live with it; whom it hath here reproached, it &s;hall there di&s;quiet; whom it hath here honoured, it &s;hall there reward.

<P>"I was now become an independant member of the community; and my behaviour had been &s;uch, that I &s;ucceeded to the condition of my father, with the re&s;pect of a people, among&s;t whom honour is attain|able only by merit. But his death had di&s;&s;olved that tie which gratitude, and indeed affection for the old man, had on my heart; and the &s;cene of his death naturally awakened in me the remembrance of a father in England, who&s;e age might now be helple&s;s, and call for the aid of a long lo&s;t &s;on to &s;olace and &s;upport it. This idea, once rou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, became every day more powerful, and at la&s;t I re&s;olved to communicate it to the tribe, and tell them my purpo&s;e of returning home.</P>

<P>"I returned thanks to the old man for his coun&s;el, and to the whole tribe for their kindne&s;s; and having, according to his advice, taken a few of the furs they offered me, I re&s;umed the tattered remains of the European dre&s;s which I had on when I e&s;caped from the fort, and took the neare&s;t road to one of our back-&s;ettlements, which I reached, without any accident, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Indian who had long &s;hown a particular attachment to me, and who now attended me on my way.</P>
<P>"Yonder &s;moke," &s;aid my conductor,
<Q>ri&s;es from the dwellings of your countrymen. You now return to a world which I have heard you de&s;cribe as full of calamity; but the &s;oul you po&s;&s;e&s;s is the &s;oul of a man; remember that to fortitude there is no &s;ting in adver|&s;ity, and in death no evil to the valiant.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="018007_0144_0FA455B7ED68F060">"<HI>When he left me, I &s;tood for &s;ome minutes, looking back, on one hand to the wilds I had pa&s;&s;ed, and on the other, to the &s;cenes of cultivation which European indu&s;try had formed; and it may &s;urprize you to hear, that though there wanted not &s;ome re|kindling attachment to a people among&s;t whom my fir&s;t breath had been drawn, and my youth &s;pent, yet my imagination drew, on this &s;ide, fraud, hypocri&s;y, and fordid ba&s;ene&s;s; while on that &s;eemed to pre&s;ide hone&s;ty, truth, and &s;avage noblene&s;s of &s;oul. When I appeared at the door of one of the hou&s;es in the &s;ettlement that was neare&s;t me, I was immediately acco&s;ted by its ma&s;ter, who judging from the bundle of furs which I carried, that I had been trading among the Indians, a&s;ked me, with much kindne&s;s, to take up my lodging with him.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>Of this offer I was very glad to accept, though I found a &s;car|city of words to thank my countryman for his favour; as, from want of u&s;e, my remembrance of the Engli&s;h language had been &s;o much effaced, as not only to repre&s;s fluency, but even to pre|vent an ordinary command of expre&s;&s;ion; and I was more e&s;pecial|ly at a lo&s;s for ceremonious phra&s;eology, that department of lang|uage being unknown in the country whence I was ju&s;t returned. My landlord was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed, when I could at la&s;t make &s;hift to inform him of my having pa&s;&s;ed &s;o many years among the Indians.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>He a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions about cu&s;toms which never ex|i&s;ted, and told me of a multitude of things, of which all the time I had lived in that country, I had never dreamed the po&s;&s;ibility. Indeed, from the &s;uperiority of his expre&s;&s;ion, joined to that fund of &s;uppo&s;ed knowlege which it &s;erved to communicate, a by-&s;tand|er would have been led to imagine, that he was de&s;cribing, to &s;ome ignorant gue&s;t, a country with who&s;e manners he had been long conver&s;ant, and among who&s;e inhabitants he had pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his life.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>At length, however, his di&s;cour&s;e centered upon the fur-trade, and naturally glided from that to an offer of purcha&s;ing my beaver-&s;kins. The&s;e things, I was informed by my courteous entertainer, had fallen &s;o much in their price of late, that the traders could hardly defray their journey in procuring them; that him&s;elf had lo&s;t by &s;ome late bargains in that way; but that, to oblige a &s;tran|ger, the &s;ingularity of who&s;e adventures had intere&s;ted him in his behalf, he would give me the highe&s;t price at which he had heard of their being &s;old for a long time pa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>This I accepted without he&s;itation, as I had neither language nor inclination for haggling, and having procured as much money by the bargain as, I imagined, would more than carry me to a &s;ea|port, I proceeded on my journey, accompanied by an inhabitant of William&s;burg, who was returning from an annual vi&s;it, to a &s;ettlement on the back-frontiers, which he had purcha&s;ed in part|ner&s;hip with another, who con&s;tantly re&s;ided upon it. He &s;eemed to be naturally of an inqui&s;itive di&s;po&s;ition; and having learned
<PB N="51" REF="018007_0145_0FA455B8445EE968">
from my former landlord, that I had lived &s;everal years with the Indians, tormented me, all the while our journey la&s;ted, with in|terrogatories concerning their country and manners. But, as he was le&s;s opinionative of his own knowlege in the matter than my la&s;t Engli&s;h acquaintance, I was the more ea&s;ily prevailed on to &s;ati&s;fy his curio&s;ity, though at the expence of a greater number of words than I could conveniently &s;pare; and, at la&s;t, he made him|&s;elf entirely ma&s;ter of my &s;tory, from the time of my leaving the regiment in which I had &s;erved, down to the day on which I delivered my recital,</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>When I mentioned my having &s;old my beaver-&s;kins for a cer|tain &s;um, he &s;tarted a&s;ide, and then lifting up his eyes in an eja|culatory manner, expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment how a Chri&s;tian could be guilty of &s;uch mon&s;trous di&s;hone&s;ty, which, he &s;aid, was no better than one would have expected in a</HI> Savage; <HI>for that my &s;kins were worth at lea&s;t three times the money.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>I &s;miled at his notions of comparative morality, and bore the intelligence with a calmne&s;s, that &s;eemed to move his admiration. He thanked God that all were not &s;o ready to take advantage of Ignorance or misfortune, and cordially gra&s;ping my hand, beg|ged me to make his hou&s;e at William&s;burg my own, till &s;uch time as I could procure my pa&s;&s;age to England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Conclu&s;ion of the &s;tranger's &s;tory.</HEAD>
<P>"PURSUANT to this friendly invitation, I accompanied him to his hou&s;e on our arrival in that place. For &s;ome days my landlord behaved to me in the mo&s;t friendly manner, and furni&s;hed me, of his own accord, with linen and wearing apparel; &s;everal articles of which, though nece&s;&s;aries in the poli&s;hed &s;ociety of tho&s;e among&s;t whom I now re&s;ided, my ideas of Indian &s;impli|city made me con&s;ider &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>"During this time I frequently attended him at his &s;tore, while he was receiving con&s;ignments of goods, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him and his &s;ervants in the di&s;po&s;al and a&s;&s;ortment of them.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t he received this a&s;&s;i&s;tance as a favor; but I could ob&s;erve that he &s;oon began to look upon it as a matter of right, and called me to bear a hand, as he termed it, in a manner rather too peremp|tory for my pride to &s;ubmit to. At la&s;t, when he ventured to tax me with &s;ome office of menial &s;ervility, I told him, I did not con&s;ider my&s;elf his dependant any farther than gratitude for his favors demanded, and refu&s;ed to perform it. Upon which he let me know, that he looked upon me as his &s;ervant, and that, if I did not immediately obey his command, he would find a way to be revenged of me.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="018007_0146_0FA455B8F4EDCA18">This declaration heightened my re&s;entment, and confirmed my refu&s;al. I de&s;ired him to give me an account of what money he had expended, in tho&s;e articles with which he had &s;upplied me, that I might pay him out of the &s;mall &s;um I had in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and, if that was not &s;ufficient, I would rather &s;ell my new habili|ments, and return to my rags, that be indebted for a farthing to his genero&s;ity. He an&s;wered, that he would clear accounts with me by and by. He did &s;o, by making oath before a magi&s;trate, that I was a de&s;erter from his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and, according to my own confe&s;&s;ion, had a&s;&s;ociated with the &s;avages, enemies of the province.</P>
<P>"As I could deny neither of tho&s;e charges, I was thrown into pri&s;on, where I &s;hould have been in danger of &s;tarving, had not the curio&s;ity of &s;ome of the townsfolks induced them to vi&s;it me, when they commonly contributed &s;ome trifle towards my &s;upport; till at length, partly, I &s;uppo&s;e, from the abatement of my accu&s;er's anger, and partly from the flagrancy of detaining me in pri&s;on with|out any provi&s;ion for my maintenance, I was &s;uffered to be enlarg|ed; and a ve&s;&s;el being then ready to &s;oil for England, &s;everal of who&s;e hands had de&s;erted her, the ma&s;ter agreed to take me on board for the con&s;ideration of my working the voyage. For this indeed I was not in the lea&s;t qualified as to &s;kill; but my &s;trength and per&s;everance made up, in &s;ome operations, for the want of it.</P>
<P>"As this was before the end of the war, the &s;hip in which I &s;ailed happened to be taken by a French privateer, who carried her into Bre&s;t. This, to me, who had already anticipated my arrival at home, to comfort the declining age of a parent, was the mo&s;t mortifying accident of any I had hitherto met with; but the captain and &s;ome pa&s;&s;engers who were aboard of us, &s;eemed to make light of their misfortune.</P>
<P>"The &s;hip was in&s;ured, &s;o that in property the owners could &s;uffer little; as for our&s;elves, &s;aid they, the French are the po&s;ite&s;t enemies in the world, and, till we are exchanged, will treat us with that civil demeanor, &s;o peculiar to their nation. We are not (addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to me) among <HI>&s;avages,</HI> as you were.&mdash;How it fared with them, I know not; I and other inferior members of the crew, were thru&s;t into a dungeon, dark, damp, and loath|&s;ome; where, from the number confined in it, and the want of proper circulation, the air became putrid to the mo&s;t horrible degree; and the allowance for our provi&s;ion was not equal to two pence a day.</P>
<P>"To hard living I could well enough &s;ubmit, who had been frequently accu&s;tomed, among the Cherokees, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t three or four days on a &s;talk of Indian corn moi&s;tened in the fir&s;t brook I lighted on; but the want of air and exerci&s;e I could not &s;o ea&s;ily endure. I lo&s;t the u&s;e of my limbs, and lay motionle&s;s on my back, in a corner of the hole we were confined in, covered with vermin, and &s;upported, in that wretched &s;tate only by the infre|quent humanity of &s;ome &s;ailor, who crammed my mouth with a
<PB N="53" REF="018007_0147_0FA455BA0C6C1590">
bit of his brown bread, &s;oftened in &s;tinking water. The natural vigor of my con&s;titution, however, bore up again&s;t this complicated mi&s;ery, till, upon the conclu&s;ion of the peace we regained our freedom.</P>
<P>"But when I was &s;et at liberty, I had not &s;trength to enjoy it; and after my companions were gone, was obliged to crawl &s;everal weeks about the &s;treets of Bre&s;t, where the charity of &s;ome well-di&s;po&s;ed Frenchmen be&s;towed now and then a tri&s;le upon the <HI>panvre &s;auvage,</HI> as I was called, till I recovered the exerci&s;e of my limbs and was able to work my pa&s;&s;age in a Dutch merchant-&s;hip bound for England.</P>
<P>"The mate of this ve&s;&s;el happened to be a Scotchman, who hearing me &s;peak the language of Britain, and having enquired into the particulars of my &s;tory, humanely attached him&s;elf to my &s;ervice, and made my &s;ituation much more comfortable than any I had for &s;ome time experienced, We &s;ailed from Bre&s;t with a fair wind, but had not been long at &s;ea till it &s;hifted, and blew pretty fre&s;h at Ea&s;t, &s;o that we were kept for &s;everal days beating up the Channel; at the end of which it increa&s;ed to &s;o violent a degree, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to hold a cour&s;e, and the &s;hip was &s;uf|fered to &s;cud before the &s;torm.</P>
<P>"At the clo&s;e of the &s;econd day, the wind &s;uddenly chopp'd a|bout into a we&s;terly point, though without any abatement of its violence; and very &s;oon after day-break of the third, we were driving on the &s;outh-we&s;t coa&s;t of England, right to the leeward. The con&s;ternation of the crew became now &s;o great, that if any expedient had remained to &s;ave us, it would have &s;carce allowed them to put it in practice.</P>
<P>"The mate, who &s;eemed to be the able&s;t &s;ailor on board, ex|horted them at lea&s;t to endeavour running the &s;hip into a bay, which opened a little on our &s;tarboard-quarter, where the &s;hore was flat and &s;andy; comforting them with the reflexion, that they &s;hould be ca&s;t on friendly ground, and not among <HI>&s;avages.</HI> His advice and encouragement had the de&s;ired effect; and notwith|&s;tanding the perils with which I &s;aw my&s;elf &s;urrounded, I looked with a gleam of &s;ati&s;faction on the coa&s;t of my native land, which for &s;o many years I had not &s;een.</P>
<P>"Unfortunately a ridge of rocks ran almo&s;t acro&s;s the ba&s;on in|to which, with infinite labor, we were directing our cour&s;e; and the &s;hip &s;truck upon them, about the di&s;tance of half a league from the &s;hore. All was now uproar and confu&s;ion. The longboat was lanched by &s;ome of the crew, who, with the captain, got immedi|ately into her, and brandi&s;hing their long knives, threatened with in&s;tant death any who &s;hould attempt to follow them, as &s;he was already loaded beyond her burden. Indeed there remained at this time in the &s;hip only two &s;ailors, the mate, and my&s;elf; the fir&s;t were wa&s;hed overboard while they hung on the &s;hip's &s;ide attempt|ing to leap into the boat, and we &s;aw them no more; nor had their hard-hearted companions a better fate; they had &s;carcely
<PB N="54" REF="018007_0148_0FA455BA82D013D8">
rowed a cable's length from the &s;hip, when the boat over&s;et, and every one on board her peri&s;hed. There now remained only my friend the mate, and I, who, con&s;ulting a moment together, a|greed to keep by the &s;hip till &s;he &s;hould &s;plit, and endeavour to &s;ave our&s;elves on &s;ome broken plank which the &s;torm might drive on &s;hore.</P>
<P>"We had ju&s;t time to come to this re&s;olution, when, by the vio|lence of a wave that broke over the &s;hip, her main-ma&s;t went by the board, and we were &s;wept off the deck at the &s;ame in&s;tant. My companion could not &s;wim; but I had been taught that art by my Indian friends to the greate&s;t degree of expertne&s;s. I was therefore more unea&s;y about the hone&s;t Scotchman's fate than my own, and quitting the ma&s;t, of which I had caught hold on its fall, &s;wam to the place where he fir&s;t ro&s;e to the &s;urface, and catching him by the hair, held his head tolerably above water, till he was able &s;o far to recollect him&s;elf, as to cling by a part of the &s;hrouds of our floating main-ma&s;t, to which I bore him. In our pa&s;&s;age to the &s;hore on this &s;lender float, he was &s;everal times obliged to quit his hold, from his &s;trength's being exhau&s;ted; but I was al|ways &s;o fortunate as to be able to replace him in his former &s;itua|tion, till, at la&s;t, we were thrown upon the beach, near to the bottom of that bay at the mouth of which our &s;hip had &s;truck.</P>
<P>"I was not &s;o much &s;pent by my fatigue, but that I was able to draw the mate &s;afe out of the water, and advancing to a croud of people whom I &s;aw a&s;&s;embled near us, began to entreat their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance for him in very pathetic terms; when, to my utter a&s;toni&s;h|ment, one of them &s;truck at me with a bludgeon, while another making up to my fellow-&s;ufferer, would have beat out his brains with a &s;tone, if I had not run up nimbly behind him, and da&s;h'd it from his uplifted hand. This man happened to be armed with a hanger, which he in&s;tantly drew, and made a furious &s;troke at my head.</P>
<P>"I parried his blow with my arm, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;eizing his wri&s;t, gave it &s;o &s;udden a wrench, that the weapon dropped to the ground. I in&s;tantly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my&s;elf of it, and &s;tood a&s;tride my companion with the a&s;pect of an angry lione&s;s guarding her young from the hunter. The appearance of &s;trength and fiercene&s;s which my figure exhited, kept my enemies a little at bay, when fortunately we &s;aw advancing a body of &s;oldiers, headed by an officer, whom a gentleman of humanity in the neighbourhood had prevailed on to march to the place for the pre&s;ervation of any of the crew whom the &s;torm might &s;pare, or any part of the cargo that might chance to be thrown a&s;hore. At &s;ight of this detachment the croud di&s;per&s;ed, and left me ma&s;ter of the field. The officer very humanely took charge of my compa|nion and me, brought us to his quarters in the neighbourhood, and accommodated me with the&s;e very cloaths which I now have on. From him I learned, that tho&s;e Engli&s;hmen, who (as our mate by way of comfort ob&s;erved) were not <HI>&s;avages,</HI> had the idea
<PB N="55" REF="018007_0149_0FA455BB351CAE00">
tran&s;mitted them from their fathers, that all wrecks became their property by the immediate hand of God; and, as in their appre|hen&s;ion, that denomination belonged only to &s;hips from which there landed no living thing, their ho&s;tile endeavors again&s;t the Scotchman's life and mine, proceeded from a de&s;ire of bringing our ve&s;&s;el into that &s;uppo&s;ed condition.</P>
<P>"After having weathered &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;a&s;ters, I am at la&s;t arrived near the place of my nativity; fain would I hope, that a parent and a &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e tender remembrance, mingled with that of happier days, now ru&s;hes on my &s;oul, are yet alive to pardon the wanderings of my youth, and receive me after tho&s;e hard&s;hips to which its ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions have &s;ubjected me. Like the prodigal &s;on, I bring no worldly wealth along with me; but I return with a mind con&s;cious of its former errors, and &s;eeking that peace which the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions de&s;troyed. To have u&s;ed pro&s;perity well, is the fir&s;t favored lot of heaven; the next is his, whom ad|ver&s;ity has not &s;mitten in vain."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. Bolton and his companion meet with an uncommon adventure.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the &s;tranger had fini&s;hed his narration, Bolton ex|pre&s;&s;ed, in very &s;trong terms, his compa&s;&s;ion for the hard|&s;hips he had &s;uffered. "I do not wi&s;h, &s;aid he to be the prophet of evil; but if it &s;hould happen, that your expectations of the comfort your native country is to afford you be di&s;appointed, it will give me the true&s;t plea&s;ure to &s;helter a head on which &s;o many vici&s;&s;itudes have beat, under that roof of which Providence has made me ma&s;ter."&mdash;He was interrupted by the trampling of hor&s;es at a di&s;tance; his fears, wakeful at this time, were immediately rou&s;ed; the &s;tranger ob&s;erved his confu&s;ion. "You &s;eem unea&s;y, &s;ir, &s;aid he; but they are not the retreats of hou&s;ele&s;s poverty like this, that violence and rapine are wont to attack."&mdash;"You mi&s;|take" (an&s;wered Harry, who was now &s;tanding at the door of the chapel,)" "the ground of my alarm; at pre&s;ent I have a parti|lar rea&s;on for my fears, which is nearer to me than my own per|&s;onal &s;afety."</P>
<P>He li&s;tened; &mdash; the noi&s;e grew fainter; but he marked by the light of the moon, which now &s;hone out again, the direction whence it &s;eemed to proceed, which was over an open part of the common. "They are gone this way," he cried, with an eager|ne&s;s of look, gra&s;ping one of the knotty branches which the &s;oldier's fire had &s;pared. "If there is danger in your way," &s;aid his companion, "you &s;hall not meet it alone." They &s;allied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rth together.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="018007_0150_0FA455BC00CED150">They had not proceeded above a quarter of a mile, when they perceived, at a di&s;tance, the twinkling of lights in motion: their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce was quickened at the &s;ight; but in a few minutes tho&s;e were extingui&s;hed, the moon was darkened by another cloud, and the wind began to howl again. They advanced however on the line in which they imagined the lights to have appeared, when, in one of the pau&s;es of the &s;torm, they heard &s;hrieks, in a female voice, that &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from &s;ome place but a little way off. They ru&s;hed forward in the direction of the &s;ound, till they were &s;topped by a pretty high high wall.</P>
<P>Having made &s;hift to &s;cramble over this, they found them&s;elves in the garden belonging to a low-built hou&s;e, from one of the windows of which, they &s;aw the glimmer of a candle through the openings of the &s;hutters; but the voice had cea&s;ed, and all was &s;ilent within. Bolton knocked at the door, but received no an|&s;wer; when &s;uddenly, the &s;creaming was repeated with more violence than before. He and his companion now threw them&s;eves with &s;o much force again&s;t the door, as to bur&s;t it open. They ru&s;h|ed into the room whence the noi&s;e proceeded; when the fir&s;t object that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to Bolton was Mi&s;s Sindall on her knees, her cloaths torn, and her hair di&s;hevelled, with two &s;ervants holding her arms, imploring mercy of &s;ir Thomas, who was calling out in a furious tone, "Damn your pity, ra&s;cals, carry her to bed by force."</P>
<P>"Turn, villain, cried Harry, turn, and defend your&s;elf." Sindall &s;tarted at the well known voice, and pulling out a pi&s;tol, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">red it within a few feet of the other's face; he mi&s;&s;ed, and Bolton pu&s;hed forward to clo&s;e with him; when one of the &s;ervants, quitting Mi&s;s Sindall, threw him&s;elf between him and his ma&s;ter, and made a blow at his head with the but-end of a hunting whip; this Harry catched on his &s;tick, and in the return, levelled the fellow with the ground. His ma&s;ter now fired another pi&s;tol, which would have probably taken more effect than the former, had not Bolton's new acquaintance &s;truck up the muzzle ju&s;t as it went off, the ball going through a window at Harry's back. The baronet had his &s;word now drawn in the other hand, and, chang|ing the object of his attack, he made a furious pa&s;s at the &s;oldier, who parried it with his hanger. At the &s;econd lounge &s;ir Thomas's violence threw him on the point of his adver&s;ary's weapon, which entered his body a little below the brea&s;t. He &s;taggered a few paces backwards, and clapping one hand on the place, leaned with the other on a table that &s;tood behind him, and cried out, that he was a dead man. "My God! exclaimed the &s;tranger, are not you &s;ir Thomas Sindall?" &mdash; "Sir Thomas Sindall!" cried a woman, who now entered, half-dre&s;&s;ed, with the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, "It is, it is &s;ir Thomas Sindall," &s;aid the landlady, "for God's &s;ake do his honour no hurt." "I hope," continued the other, with a look of earne&s;t wildne&s;s, "you have not been a-bed with that young lady?"&mdash;She waited not a reply&mdash;"for, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. A pro&s;ecution of the di&s;covery mentioned in the la&s;t chapter.</HEAD>
<P>"I HAVE been a wicked woman; may God and this lady forgive me! but heaven is my witne&s;s, that I was thus far on my way to confe&s;s all to your honour, (turning to &s;ir Thomas Sindall) that I might have peace in my mind before I died. You will remember, &s;ir, that this young lady's mother was delivered of her at the hou&s;e of one of your tenants, where Mr. Camplin (I think that was his name,) brought her for that purpo&s;e. I was entru&s;ted with the charge of her as her nur&s;e, along with &s;ome trinkets, &s;uch as young children are in u&s;e to have, and a con&s;i|derable &s;um of money, to provide any other nece&s;&s;aries &s;he &s;hould want.</P>
<P>"At that very time I had been drawn in to a&s;&s;ociate with a gang of pilfering vagrants, who&s;e &s;tolen goods I had often received into my hou&s;e, and helped to di&s;po&s;e of. Fearing, therefore, that I might one day be brought to an account for my pa&s;t offences, if I remained where I was, and having at the &s;ame time the tempta|tion of &s;uch a booty before me, I formed a &s;cheme for making off with the money and trinkets I had got from Mr. Camplin: it was, to make things appear as if my charge and I had been lo&s;t in cro&s;|&s;ing the river, which then happened to be in flood.</P>
<P>"For this purpo&s;e, I daubed my own cloak, and the infant's wrapper, with mud and &s;leech, and left them clo&s;e to the overflow of the &s;tream, a little below the common ford. With &s;hame I confe&s;s it, as I have often &s;ince thought on it with horror, I was more than once tempted to drown the child, that &s;he might not be a burden to me in my flight; but &s;he looked &s;o innocent and &s;weet, while &s;he cla&s;ped my fingers in her little hand, that I had not the heart to execute my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="018007_0152_0FA455BD8D6AAD58">Having endeavoured in this manner to account for my di&s;ap|pearing, &s;o as to prevent all farther enquiry, I joined a party of tho&s;e wretches, who&s;e a&s;&s;ociate I had &s;ome time been, and left that part of the country altogether. By their a&s;&s;i&s;tance too, I was put on a method of di&s;gui&s;ing my face &s;o much, that had any of my acquaintance met me, of which there, was very little chance, it would have been &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for them to recollect it. My booty was put into the common &s;tock, and the child was found u&s;eful to rai&s;e compa&s;&s;ion when we went a-begging, which was one part of the occupation we followed.</P>
<P>"After I had continued in this &s;ociety the be&s;t part of a year, during which time we met with various turns of fortune, a &s;cheme was formed by the remaining part of us (for &s;everal of my com|panions had been bani&s;hed, or confined to hard labour in the inter|val) to break into the hou&s;e of a wealthy farmer, who, we under|&s;tood, had a few days before received a large &s;um of money on a bargain for the lea&s;e of an e&s;tate, which the proprietor had redeem|ed. Our project was executed with &s;ucce&s;s; but a quarrel ari&s;ing about the di&s;tribution of the &s;poil, one of the gang de&s;erted, and informed a neighbouring ju&s;tice of the whole tran&s;action, and the places of our retreat.</P>
<P>"I happened to be a fortune-telling in this gentleman's hou&s;e, when his informer came to make the di&s;covery; and, being clo&s;etted with one of the maid &s;ervants, overheard him enquiring for the ju&s;tice, and de&s;iring to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with him in private. I immediately &s;u&s;pected his de&s;ign, and having got out of the hou&s;e, eluded pur&s;uit by my knowlege in the by-paths and private roads of the country.</P>
<P>"It immediately occurred to me to di&s;burden my&s;elf of the child, as &s;he not only retarded my flight, but was a mark by which I might be di&s;covered; but, abandoned as I had then become, I found my&s;elf attached to her by that &s;ort of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fection which women conceive for the infants they &s;uckle. I would not, therefore, ex|po&s;e her in any of tho&s;e unfrequented places through which I pa&s;&s;ed in my flight, where her death mu&s;t have been the certain con&s;e|quence; and, two or three times, when I would have dropped her at &s;ome farmer's door, I was prevented by the fear of di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t I happened to meet with yoor honour. You may re|collect, &s;ir, that the &s;ame night on which this lady, then an infant, was found, a beggar a&s;ked alm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of you at a farrier's door, where you &s;topped to have one of your hor&s;es &s;hoes fa&s;tened. I was that beggar, and hearing from a boy who held your hor&s;e, that your name was &s;ir Thomas Sindall, and that you were returning to a hunting-&s;eat you had in the neighourhood, I left the infant on a narrow part of the road a little way before you, where it was im|po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould mi&s;s of finding her, and &s;tood at the back of a hedge to ob&s;erve your behaviour when you came up. I &s;aw you make your &s;ervant pick up the child, and place her on the &s;addle before him.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="018007_0153_0FA455C02469C700">"Then, having, as I thought, &s;ufficiently provided for her, by thus throwing her under the protection of her father, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> off as fa&s;t a I could, and continued my flight, till I imagined I was out of the reach of detection, But, being &s;ome time after appre|hended on &s;u&s;picion, and not able to give a good account of my|&s;elf, I was adverti&s;ed in the papers, and di&s;covered to have been an accomplice in committing that robbery I mentioned, for which &s;ome of the gang had been already condemned and executed. I was tried for the crime, and was ca&s;t for tran&s;portation. Before I was put on board the &s;hip that was to carry me and &s;everal others abroad, I wrote a few lines to your honour, acquainting you with the circum&s;tances of my behaviour towards your daughter; but this, I &s;uppo&s;e, as it was entru&s;ted to a boy who u&s;ed to go on errands for the pri&s;oners, has never come to your hands.</P>
<P>"Not long ago I returned from tran&s;portation, and betook my&s;elf to my old cour&s;e of life again. But I happened to be &s;eized with the &s;mall pox, that raged in a village I pa&s;&s;ed through; and, partly from the violence of the di&s;temper, partly from the want of proper care in the fir&s;t &s;tages of it, was brought &s;o low, that a phy&s;ician, who&s;e humanity induced him to vi&s;it me, gave me over for lo&s;t, I found that the terrors of death on a &s;ick-bed had more effect on my con&s;cience than all the hard&s;hips I had formerly undergone, and I began to look back with the keene&s;t remor&s;e on a life &s;o &s;pent as mine had been. It plea&s;ed God, however, that I &s;hould recover, and I have &s;ince endeavoured to make &s;ome reparation for my pa&s;t offences by my penitence.</P>
<P>"Among&s;t other things, I often reflected on what I had done with regard to your child; and being &s;ome days ago accidentally near Sindall-Park, I went thither, and tried to learn &s;omething of what had befallen her. I under&s;tood, from &s;ome of the neigh|bours, that a young lady had been brought up from her infancy with your aunt, and was &s;aid to be the daughter of a friend of yours, who had committed her to your care at his death. But, upon enquiring into the time of her being brought to your hou&s;e, I was per&s;uaded that &s;he mu&s;t be the &s;ame I had conjectured, imputing the &s;tory of her being another's, to your de&s;ire of con|cealing that &s;he was yours, which I imagined you had learned from the letter I wrote before my tran&s;portation; till meeting, at a hou&s;e of entertainment, with a &s;ervant of your honour's, he in|formed me, in the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation, that it was reported you were going to be married to the young lady who had lived &s;o long in your family.</P>
<P>"On hearing this I was confounded, and did not know what to think; but, when I began to fear that my letter had never reached you, I trembled at the thought of what my wickedne&s;s might occa&s;ion, and could have no ea&s;e in my mind, till I &s;hould &s;et out for Bil&s;wood to confe&s;s the whole affair to your honour. I was to-night overtaken by the &s;torm near this hou&s;e, and pre|vailed on the landlady, though it &s;eemed much again&s;t her incli|nation, to permit me to take up my quarters here. About half an hour ago I was waked with the &s;hreiks of &s;ome per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="60" REF="018007_0154_0FA455C34CBE5440">
and upon a&s;king the landlady, who lay in the &s;ame room with me, what was the matter, &s;he bid me be quiet and &s;ay nothing; for it was only a worthy gentleman of her acquaintance, who had overtaken a young girl, a foundling he had bred up, that had &s;tolen a &s;um of money from his hou&s;e, and run away with one of his footmen.</P>
<P>"At the word <HI>foundling,</HI> I felt a kind of &s;omething I cannot de&s;cribe, and I was terrified when I overheard &s;ome part of your di&s;cour&s;e, and gue&s;&s;ed what your intentions were; I ro&s;e, there|fore, in &s;pite of the landlady, and had got thus far dre&s;&s;ed, when we heard the door bur&s;t open, and pre&s;ently a noi&s;e of fighting above &s;tairs. Upon this we ran up together, and to what has happened &s;ince, this company has been witne&s;s."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. Mi&s;s Sindall di&s;covers another relation.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the &s;en&s;ations of Sindall or Lucy, when the &s;ecret of her birth was unfolded. In the countenance of the la&s;t were mingled the indications of fear and pity, joy and wonder; while her father, turned upon her an eye of tenderne&s;s cha&s;tened with &s;hame. "Oh! thou injured innocence! &s;aid he, for I know not how to call thee child, can&s;t thou forgive tho&s;e &mdash; Good God! Bolton, from what ha&s;t thou &s;aved me!" Lucy was now kneeling at his feet.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Talk not, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he, of the errors of the pa&s;t; methinks I look on it as &s;ome horrid dream, which it dizzies my head to re|collect. My father!&mdash;Gracious God! have I a father?&mdash;I cannot &s;peak; but there are a thou&s;and things that beat here!&mdash;is there another parent to whom I &s;hould al&s;o kneel?"</P>
<P>Sir Thomas ca&s;t up a look to heaven, and his groans &s;topped, for a while, his utterance.&mdash;"Oh! Harriet! if thou art now an angel of Mercy, look down and forgive the wretch that murdered thee!"&mdash;"Harriet!" exclaimed the &s;oldier, &s;tarting at the &s;ound, "what Harriet? what Harriet?" Sindall looked earne&s;tly in his face&mdash;"Oh! heavens! he cried, art thou? &mdash; &s;ure thou art! &mdash; Anne&s;ly!&mdash;look not, look not on me&mdash;thy &s;i&s;ter&mdash;but I &s;hall not live for thy upbraidings &mdash; thy &s;i&s;ter&punc; was the mother of my child! &mdash;Thy father &mdash;to what does this moment of reflexion reduce me! &mdash; thy father fell with his daughter, the victims of that villainy which overcame her innocence!" Anne&s;ly looked &s;ternly upon him, and anger for a moment enflamed his cheeks; but it gave way to &s;ofter feelings &mdash; "What, both! both!" &mdash; and he bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>Bolton now &s;tepped up to this new-acquired friend. "I am, &s;aid he, comparatively, but a &s;pectator of this fateful &s;cene; let me en|deavour to comfort the di&s;tre&s;s of the innocent, and alleviate the pangs of the guilty. In &s;ir Thomas Sindall's pre&s;ent condition, re&s;entment would be inju&s;tice. See here, my friend, (pointing to

Lucy) a mediatrix, who forgets the man in the father." Anne&s;ly gazed upon her. "She is, &s;he is, he cried, the daughter of my Harriet; &mdash; that eye, that lip, that look of &s;orrow!" &mdash; He flung him&s;elf on her neck; Bolton look'd on them enraptur'd; and even the languor of Sindall's face, was cro&s;s'd with a gleam of mo|mentary plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>Sir Thomas's &s;ervant now arrived accompanied by a &s;urgeon, who upon examining and dre&s;&s;ing his wound, was of opinion, that in it&s;elf it had not the appearance of imminent danger, but that from the &s;tate of his pul&s;e he was apprehen&s;ive of a &s;upervening fever. He ordered him to be put to bed, and his room to be kept as quiet as po&s;&s;ible. As this gentleman was an acquaintance of Bolton's, the latter informed him of the &s;tate in which &s;ir Thomas's mind mu&s;t be from the di&s;coveries that the preceding hour had made to him. Upon which the &s;urgeon begged that he might, for the pre&s;ent, avoid &s;eeing Mi&s;s Sindall or Mr. Anne&s;ly, or talking with any one on the &s;ubject of tho&s;e di&s;coveries; but he could not prevent the intru&s;ion of thought; and not many hours after, his patient fell into a roving &s;ort of &s;lumber, in which he would often &s;tart, and muttter the words Harriet, Lucy, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">, and Ince&s;t.</P>
<P>Bolton and Lucy now enjoyed one of tho&s;e luxurious interviews, which ab&s;ence, and hard&s;hips during that ab&s;ence, procure to &s;ouls formed for each other. She related to him all her pa&s;t di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, of which my readers have been already informed, and added the account of that night's event, part of which only they have heard. Her&s;elf indeed was not then mi&s;tre&s;s of it all; the &s;tory at large was this:</P>
<P>The &s;ervant, who&s;e attachment to her I have formerly mentioned, had been di&s;covered, in that conference which produced her re&s;o|lution of leaving Bil&s;wood, by Mrs Boothby's maid, who immedi|ately communicated to her mi&s;tre&s;s her &s;u&s;picions of the plot going forward between Mi&s;s Sindall and Robert. Upon this the latter was &s;everely interrogated by his ma&s;ter, and being confronted with Sukey, who repeated the words &s;he had overheard of the young lady and him, he confe&s;&s;ed her intention of e&s;caping by his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Sir Thomas, drawing his &s;word, threatened to put him in&s;tant|ly to death. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> he did not expiate his treachery by obeying impli|citly the instructions he &s;hould the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> receive: the&s;e were, to have the hor&s;e &s;addled at the hour agreed on, and to proceed, without revealing to Mi&s;s Sindall the confe&s;&s;ion he had made, on the road which &s;ir Thomas now marked out for him. With this, after the mo&s;t horrid denunciations of vengeance in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, the poor fellow was fain to comply; and hence his terror, when they were leaving the hou&s;e. They had proceeded but ju&s;t &s;o far on their way, as &s;ir Thomas thought proper for the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;ign, when he, with his valet de chambre, and another &s;ervant, who were confidants of their ma&s;ter's plea&s;ures, made up to them, and after pretending to upbraid Lucy for the imprudence and treachery of her flight he carried her to this hou&s;e of one of tho&s;e pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> dependants&punc; whom his vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> had made nece&s;&s;ary</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="018007_0156_0FA455C4F088D5D0">When &s;he came to the clo&s;e of this recital, the idea of that relation in which &s;he &s;tood to him from whom the&s;e outrages were &s;uffered, &s;topped her tongue; &s;he blu&s;hed and faltere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. "This &s;tory, &s;aid &s;he, I will now forget for ever&mdash;except to remember that gratitude which I owe to you." During the vici&s;&s;itudes of her narration, he had cla&s;ped her hand with a fearful earne&s;tne&s;s, as if he had &s;hared the dangers &s;he related; he pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips. &mdash;"Amid&s;t my Lucy's pre&s;ent momentous concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I would not intrude my own; but I am &s;elfi&s;h in the little &s;ervices &s;he acknow|leges; I look for a return."&mdash;She blu&s;hed again&mdash;"I have but little art, &s;aid &s;he, and cannot di&s;gui&s;e my &s;entiments; my Henry will tru&s;t them on a &s;ubject, which at pre&s;ent I know his delicacy will forbear."</P>
<P>Anne&s;ly now entered the room, and Bolton communicated the tru&s;t he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in his behalf, offering to put him in im|mediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;um which Mr. Rawlin&s;on had bequeath|ed to his management, and which that gentleman had more than doubled &s;ince the time it had been left by Anne&s;ly's unfortunate father.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. Sir Thomas's &s;ituation. &mdash; The expre&s;&s;ion of his penitence.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT morning, Sindall, by the advice of his &s;urgeon, was removed in a litter to his own hou&s;e, where he was &s;oon af|ter attended by an eminent phy&s;ician in aid of that gentleman's abilities. Pur&s;uant to his earne&s;t entreaties, he was accompanied thither by Anne&s;ly and Bolton. Lucy having obtained leave of his medical attendants, watched her father in the character of nur&s;e. They found on their arrival that Mrs. Booth by, having learned the revolutions of the preceding night, had left the place, and taken the road towards London. "I think not of her, &s;aid &s;ir Thomas; but there is another per&s;on, whom my former conduct bani&s;hed from my hou&s;e, whom I now wi&s;h to &s;ee in this a&s;&s;emblage of her friends, the worthy Mrs. Wi&s;tanly." Lucy undertook to write her an account of her &s;ituation, and to &s;ollicit her compliance with the reque&s;t of her father. The old lady, who had &s;till &s;trength and activity enough left for doing good, accepted the invitation; and the day following &s;he was with them at Bil&s;wood.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas &s;eemed to feel a &s;ort of melancholy &s;atisfaction in having this company of tho&s;e he had injured a&s;&s;embled under his roof. When he was told of Mrs. Wi&s;tanly's arrival, he de&s;ired to &s;ee her, and taking her hand, "I have &s;ent for you, madam, &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, that you may help me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">load <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">brance

of the pa&s;t." He then confe&s;&s;ed to her that plan of &s;e|duction by which he had overcome the virtue of Anne&s;ly, and the honour of his &s;i&s;ter. "You were a witne&s;s, he concluded, of the fall of that worth and innocence which it was in the power of my former crimes to de&s;troy; you are now come to behold the retri|bution of heaven on the guilty. By that hand whom it commi&s;&s;i|oned to avenge a parent and a &s;i&s;ter, I am cut off in the mid&s;t of my days." "I hope not, &s;ir, an&s;wered &s;he; your life, I tru&s;t, will make a better expiation. In the puni&s;hments of the divinity there is no idea of vengeance; and the infliction of what we term evil, &s;erves equally the purpo&s;e of univer&s;al benignity, with the di&s;pen&s;ation of good." "I feel, replied &s;ir Thomas, the force of that ob&s;ervation: the pain of this wound; the pre&s;entiment of death which it in&s;tils; the horror with which the recollection of my ince&s;tuous pa&s;&s;ion &s;trikes me; all the&s;e are in the catalogue of of my ble&s;&s;ings. They indeed take from me the world; but they give me my&s;elf." A vi&s;it from his phy&s;ician interrupted their di&s;cour&s;e; that gentleman did not progno&s;ticate &s;o fatally for his patient; he found the frequency or his pul&s;e con&s;iderably abated, and expre&s;&s;ed his hopes, that the &s;ucceding night, his re&s;t would be better than it had been. In this he was not mi&s;taken; and next morning the doctor continued to think &s;ir Thomas mending; but him&s;elf per&s;i&s;ted in the belief that he &s;hould not recover.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days, however, he appeared rather to gain ground than to lo&s;e it; but afterwards he was &s;eized with hectic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">its a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tated intervals, and when they left him, be complained of a univer&s;al weakne&s;s and depre&s;&s;ion. During all this time Lucy was &s;eldom away from his bed-&s;ide: from her pre&s;ence he derived peculiar plea&s;ure; and &s;ometimes when he was &s;o low as to be &s;carce able to &s;peak, would mutter out ble&s;&s;ings on her head, cal|ling her his &s;aint, his gurdian angel!</P>
<P>After he had exhau&s;ted all the powers of medicine, under the direction of &s;ome of the able&s;t of the faculty, they acknowleged all farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be vain, and one of them warned him, in a friendly manner, of his approaching end. He received this intel|ligence with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, as an event which he had ex|pected from the begining, thanked the phy&s;ician for his candor, and de&s;ired that his friends might be &s;ummoned around him, while he had yet &s;trength enough left to bid them adieu.</P>
<P>When he &s;aw them a&s;&s;embled, he delivered into Bolton's hands a paper, which he told him was his will. "To this, &s;aid he, I would not have any of tho&s;e privy, who are intere&s;ted in its beque&s;ts; and therefore I had it executed at the begining of my illne&s;s, without their participation.

an evidence of my con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your de&s;erving.&mdash;My much injured friend, for he was once my friend, (addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Anne&s;ly) will accept of the memorial I have left him.&mdash; Give me your hand, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; receive my forgivene&s;s for that wound which the arm of Providence made me provoke from yours; and when you look on a parent's and a &s;i&s;ter's tomb, &s;pare the memory of him who&s;e death &s;hall then have expiated the wrongs he did you!"&mdash; Tears were the only an&s;wer he received.&mdash;He pau&s;ed a moment; then looking round with &s;omething in his eye more elevated and &s;olemn, "I have now, &s;aid he, di&s;charged the world; mine has been called a life of plea&s;ure; had I breath, I could tell you how fal&s;e the title is; alas!

<P>At the clo&s;e of this di&s;cour&s;e, his &s;trength, which he had exerted to the utmo&s;t, &s;eemed altogether &s;pent; and he &s;unk down in the bed, in a &s;tate &s;o like death, that for &s;ome time his attendants imagined him to have actually expired. When he did revive, his &s;peech appeared to be lo&s;t; he could ju&s;t make a feeble &s;ign for a cordial that &s;tood on the table near his bed: he put it to his lips, then laid his head on the pillow, as if re&s;igning him&s;elf to his fate.</P>
<P>Lucy was too tender to bear the &s;cene; her friend. Mrs. Wi&s;tan|ly, led her, almo&s;t fainting, out of the room; "That grief, my dear Mi&s;s Sindall, &s;aid &s;he, it too amiable to be blamed; but your father &s;ugge&s;ted a con&s;olation which your piety will allow: of tho&s;e who have led his life, how few have clo&s;ed it like him!"</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EARLY</HI> next morning &s;ir Thomas Sindall expired. The com|mendable zeal of the coroner prompted him to hold an inque&s;t on his body; the jury brought in their verdict Self defence. But there was a judge in the bo&s;om of Anne&s;ly, whom it was more difficult to &s;atisfy; nor could he for a long time be brought to pardon him&s;elf that blow, for which the ju&s;tice of his country had acquitted him. After paying their la&s;t duty to &s;ir Thomas's remains, the family removed to Sindall-Park. Mrs. Wi&s;tanly was prevailed on to leave her own hou&s;e for a while, and pre&s;ide in that of which Bolton was now ma&s;ter. His delicacy needed not the ceremonial of fa&s;hion to re&s;train him from pre&s;&s;ing Mi&s;s Sindall's con&s;ent to their marriage, till a decent time had been yielded to the memory of her father.</P>
<P>When that was elap&s;ed, he received from her uncle that hand, which &s;ir Thomas had bequeathed him, and which mutual at|tachment intitled him to receive. Their happine&s;s is equal to their merit: I am often a witne&s;s of it; for they honour me with a friend|&s;hip which I know not how I have de&s;erved, unle&s;s by having few other friends. Mrs. Wi&s;tanly and I are con&s;idered as members of the family. But their benevolence is univer&s;al; the country &s;miles around them with the effects of their goodne&s;s. This is indeed the only real &s;uperiority which wealth has to be&s;tow; I never envied riches &s;o much, as &s;ince I have known Mr. Bolton. I have lived too long to be caught with the pomp of declamation, or the glare of an apothegm; but I &s;incerely believe, that you could not take from them a <HI>virtue</HI> without de&s;erving them of a <HI>plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
