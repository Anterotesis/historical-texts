N. 5.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Now proceed to conclude my narrative of my endea|vours to get quarters for the King's troops until I found my&s;elf at the end of my &s;tring, and could do no|thing more.</P>
<P>On Saturday October 15, General Gage arrived here with his officers to look to the quartering the troops him&s;elf. On Monday I called a Council in the morn|ing, and introduced the General. He told them that he was re&s;olved to quarter the two Regiments now here in Town, and demanded Quarters; and that he &s;hould re&s;erve the Barracks at the Ca&s;tle for the Iri&s;h Regi|ments or &s;uch part of them as they would contain; which has &s;ince been determined to be only one Regi|ment. After the General had left the Board, I &s;at at it until Eight o'Clock at night; two hours after Dinner time excepted. The whole was a &s;cene of Perver&s;ion, to avoid their doing any thing towards quartering the Troops, unworthy of &s;uch a Body. In the cour&s;e of the Que&s;tions I put to them, they denied that they knew of any Building belonging to the Province in the Town of Bo&s;ton that was proper to be fitted up for Barracks; and they denied that the Manufactory Hou&s;e was &s;uch
<PB N="2" REF="011179_0002_0F862C6029550248">
a Building. This was &s;o notoriou&s;ly contrary to Truth, that &s;ome Gentlemen expre&s;&s;ed their Concern that it &s;hould remain upon the Minutes; and to induce me to con&s;ent to its being expunged a motion was made in writing that the Governor be de&s;ired to order the Ma|nufactory Hou&s;e to be cleared of its pre&s;ent Inhabitants that it might be fitted up for the Reception of &s;uch part of the two Iri&s;h Regiments as could not be accommoda|ted at the Ca&s;tle Barracks. This was violently oppo&s;|ed, but was carried in the affirmative 6 to 5: Upon this I ordered the former an&s;wers to be expunged. This Re&s;olution amounting to an a&s;&s;ignment of the Ca&s;tle Barracks for the Iri&s;h Regiments effectually put an End to the Objection before made that no Quarters were due in Town until the Ca&s;tle Barracks were filled.</P>
<P>The next thing to be done was to clear the Manu|factory Hou&s;e, the preventing of which was a great Ob|ject of the Sons of Liberty. For this purpo&s;e about &s;ix or &s;even Weeks before, when the Report of Troops coming here was fir&s;t confirmed, all kinds of people were thru&s;t into this Building; and the Workhou&s;e it|&s;elf was opened, and the People confined there were per|mitted to go into the Manufactory Hou&s;e. This was admitted to be true in Council by one of the Board who is an Over&s;eer of the Poor and a principal therein. And after the Order of Council was known, &s;everal of the Chiefs of the Faction went into the Manufactory Hou&s;e, advi&s;ed the people there to keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Governor's Order, and promi&s;ed them Support. And when &s;ome of them &s;ignified their Intention to quit the Hou&s;e, they were, that if they quit the Hou&s;e, they mu&s;t quit the Town, for they would be killed if they &s;taid in it.</P>
<P>I had the advice of the be&s;t Lawyers that according to the Law and U&s;age of this Country the Owners of an Hou&s;e occupied by Tenants at Sufferance, or wrong|ful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors might enter by any Means they could and turn them out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without bringing an action. It was al&s;o certain that the Governor and Council, when the A&s;&s;embly was not &s;itting, were perfect Owners of the E&s;tates belonging to the Province, except for Ali|enation.
<PB N="3" REF="011179_0002_0F862C6029550248">
Upon the&s;e two principles I appointed the Sheriff and two of his Deputies Bailiffs of the Governor and Council for the purpo&s;e of removing the People out of the Manufactory Hou&s;e. The Sheriff was refu&s;ed admittance: upon which the Chief Ju&s;tice went with him and advi&s;ed them to give up the Hou&s;e; He was an&s;wered that they had the Opinion of the be&s;t Law|yer in the Province to keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Upon a third attempt the Sheriff finding a Window open, entered; upon which the People gathered about him and &s;hut him up; he than made a Signal to an Officer without, who brought a Party of Soldiers, who took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Yard of the Building and relieved the Sheriff from his Confinement.&mdash;This occa&s;ioned a great Mob to a&s;&s;emble with &s;ome of the Chiefs of the Faction, they were very abu&s;ive again&s;t the Soldiers, but no Mi&s;chief was done. They kept the Hou&s;e blockaded all that Day, and be&s;t part of the next Day. When &s;ome of the Council declaring that it was not intended to u&s;e Force, altho' they knew it could not be done without, and the Building not being immediately wanted, the Soldiers were withdrawn on the Evening of the &s;econd Day. Thus this Building belonging to the Government and a&s;&s;igned by the Governor and Council for his Ma|je&s;ty's U&s;e, is kept filled with the Outca&s;t of the Work|hou&s;e, and the Scum of the Town to prevent it's being u&s;ed for the accommodations of the King's Troops.</P>
<P>After this was over there was nothing more to be done with the Council until the Soldiers were billited in the Public Hou&s;es as far as they would go. This we knew would never be done; but it mu&s;t be attempted; and the Council left this Bu&s;ine&s;s to me alone without offer|ing their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which in other Ca&s;es has been u&s;ual, Indeed I did not a&s;k them, as I did not think the Bu|&s;ine&s;s would be forwarded by my a&s;&s;ociating them. I therefore &s;ummoned all the acting Ju&s;tices to meet me in the Council. Twelve of them appeared; I acquaint|ed them that the General demanded Quarters for the 2 Regiments according to the Act of Parliament. They de&s;ired to take it into Con&s;ideration among them|&s;elves.
<PB N="4" REF="011179_0003_0F862C61782BA380">
I con&s;ented, and we parted. Two Ju&s;tices, two Days after this, attended me with an An&s;wer in writing, whereby the whole Body refu&s;ed to billet the Soldiers. But the&s;e Gentlemen informing me that the Ju&s;tices had been much influenced by the Argument that the Barracks at the Ca&s;tle ought to have been fir&s;t filled, &amp;c. I &s;hewed them the Minutes of the Council whereby the Barracks at the Ca&s;tle were a&s;&s;igned to the Iri&s;h Regiments, and they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as full. This was quite new to them, the Council them&s;elves having overlooked the Effect of their Vote. I gave them a Copy of this Vote, and returned the An&s;wer de&s;iring them to recon&s;ider it. Three Days after the &s;ame Gen|tlemen informed me that they had re&s;olved again&s;t bil|leting the Soldiers, but could not agree upon the Rea|&s;ons to be a&s;&s;igned for refu&s;ing it; but the next Day they gave me an An&s;wer in writing, (a Copy of which is here inclo&s;ed) &s;igned by Eight of the Ju&s;tices; two others were again&s;t billeting, and gave other Rea&s;ons for their Refu&s;al; two others were for billeting, but declined ac|ting by them&s;elves after &s;o large a Majority of the whole Body had declared for the contrary Opinion.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the futility of the&s;e Pretences, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve that the Act directs the billeting to be by Con&s;ta|bles, Tything Men, Magi&s;trates, and other Civil Offi|cers, and in their Default or Ab&s;ence by any one Ju&s;|tice of Peace. The u&s;ual Con&s;truction of this Act has been that Magi&s;trates, &s;hould grant the Billets, and Con&s;tables deliver them; and the latter being Mini&s;teri|al cannot grant Billets without a Magi&s;trate or Ju&s;tice ordering them; By Magi&s;trates have been always un|der&s;tood the Magi&s;trates of Corporations, and where a Town is not a Corporation, the Ju&s;tices are the only Magi&s;trates who are applied to in England, and they deliver the Billets to the Con&s;tables, who &s;erve them upon the Public Hou&s;es. Now in this Town of Bo&s;ton there are no Per&s;ons come under the Denominations but Ju&s;tices and Con&s;tables. As to the Sele&s;t-Men to whom the Ju&s;tices are &s;uppo&s;ed to refer, they have been de|clared by them&s;elves, by the Council, and by the Go|verner
<PB N="5" REF="011179_0003_0F862C61782BA380">
to be neither Magi&s;trates, nor Civil Officers; and they certainly are not, for they can neither grant nor execute a Warrant. This I explained fully to the Ju&s;|tices before they gave their final An&s;wer; but to no pur|po&s;e; they being determined to refu&s;e at all Events. Thus we have an Act of Parliament which is become a great Favourite; for with the comments it has received here it is become in fact An Act to prevent His Maje&s;ty's Troops being quartered in the Town of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>Immediately after I held a Council, and informed the Board of the refu&s;al of the Ju&s;tices to billet the Soldiers. I &s;aid that I was now at the end of my Tether; for as they had declared before, that they would adhere to the Act of Parliament, and had refu&s;ed to act in that liberal way which I thought was their Duty when the King's nece&s;&s;ary Service was ob&s;tructed, I could propo&s;e nothing further to them. For I fore&s;aw that if I propo&s;ed to hire and fit up Hou&s;es &amp;c. for the Troops, they would an&s;wer that it did not become their Bu&s;ine&s;s 'till the Public Hou&s;es were full. But if any Gentleman thought it was to any purpo&s;e to put &s;uch a que&s;tion I was ready to do it: this was declined by Silence. I then inform|ed them that by rea&s;on of this general Refu&s;al of Quar|ters, the General found him&s;elf obliged to hire and fit up Hou&s;es at the Expence of the Crown for the Recep|tion of the Troops, who now (Oct. 26) e&s;pecially they who were Encamped, began to feel the want of warm Quarters and as he thought the Expence would ulti|mately fall upon the Province, he de&s;ired that I would appoint a Commi&s;&s;ary to join with and a&s;&s;i&s;t his Officers in providing &s;uch Hou&s;es, e&s;pecially with regard to the oeconomy of the Expence. I therefore de&s;ired their Ad|vice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in making &s;uch appointment. This, after a long Debate, was refu&s;ed, they &s;aying that if they &s;hould join in &s;uch Appointment it would be ad|mitting that the Province ought to be charged with the Expence; and I could appoint Auditors to examine the Accounts without them. I thereupon put an End to this Bu&s;ine&s;s, having been Employed in it from Sept. 19th to Oct. 26th in all 38 Days, without any pro&s;pect
<PB N="6" REF="011179_0004_0F862C61A393C5D8">
of doing any thing to purpo&s;e, but under an Obligation of trying every Effort before I gave it up.</P>
<P>During this time the General, who fore&s;aw how this Negociation would end, had employed his Officers to hire and fit up Hou&s;es for the Troops; &s;o that by the time I had received the definitive Refu&s;al, compleat Quarters were provided for all the Troops. But now another difficulty aro&s;e; If the Soldiers &s;hould be put into Barracks, tho' provided by the Crown, without the intervention of a Magi&s;trate, the military Officers who placed them there would be chargeable with tak|ing upon them to quarter Soldiers otherwi&s;e than by this Act, and being convicted of it by two Ju&s;tices of Peace would be Ca&s;hired ip&s;o facto. This Clau&s;e was depended upon to oblige the Soldiers to quit the Town after they had found it impracticable to get Quarters according to the Act of Parliament, and was part of the Original Plan which I mentioned to your Lord&s;hip very early. And it could not be expected that the Ju&s;|tices who had refu&s;ed to billet the Soldiers would place them in other quarters, for that would be to contradict them&s;elves. I therefore took upon my&s;elf to remove that difficulty, and by a Commi&s;&s;ion, wherein I recited his Maje&s;ty's Command to me to take every nece&s;&s;ary Step for the accommodation of the &s;aid Troops, and the &s;e|veral means by which the Execution of the Act for pro|viding Quarters for the Troops was defeated, and the Obligation I was thereby put under to provide Quarters for the Troops in the be&s;t manner I could, I authoriz|ed a per&s;on therein named, to place the &s;aid two Regi|ments in &s;uch Buildings and Hou&s;es as could be pro|cured at the expence of the Crown with the con&s;ent of the Owners. Thus has ended the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Quarter|ing the two Regiments.&mdash;As for Provi&s;ion for them at Bo&s;ton, according to the Act of Parliament, I have al|ready &s;hewn how the Order of Council for that purpo&s;e was annulled and avoided in the Origination of it. Provi&s;ion has been made at Ca&s;tle William by an Or|der of Council being made that the Provincial Commi&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="7" REF="011179_0004_0F862C61A393C5D8" MS="y">
&s;hould take care of it. But they have refu&s;ed to make &s;uch an Order for the Troops at Bo&s;ton; and therefore it is not done nor like to be done.</P>

(Copy)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I received your Lord&s;hip's Letter No. 16. I immediately communicated it to the Lieutenant Governor; and we both agreed in Opinion, that it could not be advi&s;eable to lay before the Council any part of it except what related to the providing for the Troops, until the Troops were got into Quarters: as we fore|&s;aw that the bu&s;ine&s;s of quartering the Troops would occa&s;ion a good deal of Trouble and po&s;&s;ible &s;ome Com|mo&s;ion, and it would not be advi&s;eable to bring on too much bu&s;ine&s;s at once; at lea&s;t until the Town was a little &s;ettled. This bu&s;ine&s;s of quartering your Lord|&s;hip will ob&s;erve, kept me employ'd 'till October 26th, on which day I had &s;ummoned a General Council. On this day I had 19 Coun&s;ellors, that is all but 3: I there|fore cho&s;e this Time to communicate the other Parts of your Lord&s;hip's Letter, except what relates to the call|ing the A&s;&s;embly, which I had re&s;erved until I had re|ceived further Orders about it. I made this communi|cation by an Extract, which after it was read I left in the Secretary's Hands, that the Gentlemen might pe|ru&s;e it at their lei&s;ure: I cautioned the Secretary a|gain&s;t &s;uffering a Copy to be taken, but did not re&s;train him from permitting it being read. I al&s;o gave another
<PB N="8" REF="011179_0005_0F862C63F2B6AE68">
Copy of the &s;ame extract to the fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Cu&s;toms, engaging him to keep it in his own Hands and not let a Copy be taken.</P>
<P>Immediately after I had an Occa&s;ion to move a Mat|ter that would &s;hew their Di&s;po&s;ition to pay a proper Regard to his Maje&s;ty's Commands. The Commi&s;&s;io|ners had wrote to me, de&s;iring that I would take the Advice of Council whether they might return to Town, and rea&s;&s;ume their functions, with Safety to them&s;elves and Officers. I communicated this Letter to the Coun|cil and put the Que&s;tion to them. This was very em|barra&s;&s;ing: If they an&s;wered Yea, they would be char|geable with advi&s;ing the Return of the Commi&s;&s;ioners: if they &s;aid No, they would contradict all their A&s;&s;erti|ons that there was no Occa&s;ion for Troops to &s;upport the Civil Power. They therefore, for above two Hours together, u&s;ed all kind of eva&s;ions to avoid giving an An&s;wer. I was told that they were not obliged to give Opinions: I an&s;wered that they were obliged to give Advice; and the Que&s;tion was put, whether they would advi&s;e me to a&s;&s;ure the Commi&s;&s;ioners that they might return with Safety. At la&s;t I was obliged to tell them that if they would not give me an An&s;wer, I would take their refu&s;al for an An&s;wer in the Negative: For if they could an&s;wer in the Affirmative, no Rea&s;on could be &s;uppo&s;ed why they &s;hould not give an An&s;wer; and if they could not an&s;wer in the Affirmative, they mu&s;t reconcile it with their public Declarations of the Loy|alty and Peaceablene&s;s of the Town as well as they could. At length I got an An&s;wer, 12 an&s;wering in the Affirmative, 5 declining an&s;wering becau&s;e they liv|ed out of Town, and 2 giving written An&s;wers, con|demning the Commi&s;&s;ioners for going out of the Town, and therefore refu&s;ing Advice about their Return, but concluding that all Per&s;ons would be &s;afe. In this Council I &s;at from 11 to 9, two intermediate Hours ex|cepted; and all the Bu&s;ine&s;s might have been very well done in an Hour or Two by practicable Men,</P>
<P>Before this Council met, I had been informed that &s;ome of the Board had been preparing an Addre&s;s to
<PB N="9" REF="011179_0005_0F862C63F2B6AE68">
the General, to remove the Troops from hence, that at this Meeting they might get a great number of Hands to it. When the Council broke up, I heard &s;ome of them making an Appointment to meet there the next Morning. I told them that I under&s;tood that they were going on with Bu&s;ine&s;s as a Council &s;eperately from me; but I cautioned them again&s;t proceeding. It was an|&s;wered that they &s;hould not act as a Council, but as private Gentlemen. I then de&s;ired that they would not give their Meetings the appearance of a Council, by holding them in the Council Chamber. They met the next Day and &s;ettled the Addre&s;s, which was very much &s;oftened from the fir&s;t Draught, which I am told was much more virulent again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners. It was &s;igned by 15 of the Council, among whom were the 5 who knew not enough of the Town to Vote for the &s;afety of the Commi&s;&s;ioners returning, but knew enough to join in an invective again&s;t them; 4 refu&s;ed to &s;ign. It was then pre&s;ented to the General, who ob&s;erved to them, that the Re&s;olves of the Town-Meeting were a &s;ufficient Cau&s;e for &s;ending Troops here, tho' there had been no Riots: It was an&s;wered that they were the productions of a few imprudent wrong-headed Men. The General replied that they were &s;aid to be <HI>unanim|iou&s;ly</HI> re&s;olved in a <HI>full</HI> Town-Meeting. The next Monday it appeared in all the public Papers, from whence I &s;end your Lord&s;hip the inclo&s;ed Copy.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make but few Ob&s;ervations on the Writings, the Intent of it being plain enough.&mdash;1. It is well known to your Lord&s;hip that this Kind of Writings is de&s;igned for the People and not for the Per&s;ons to whom thy are addre&s;&s;ed, This is notorious in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: The Gentlemen who moved this Bu&s;ine&s;s knew very well that the General could not move the Troops from this Town, if he could have been di&s;po&s;ed to do it; be|cau&s;e they were &s;ent hither by Order of his Maje&s;ty, and not placed here by the Di&s;cretion of the General. The General him&s;elf had told them &s;o, and I had re|peated it to them again and again to induce them to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Quartering. As therefore they could not expect the
<PB N="10" REF="011179_0006_0F862C64B1379048">
Troops would be withdrawn, we mu&s;t look for another purpo&s;e of this Addre&s;s; and it appears to be, as indeed it is the principal &s;ubject of it, the Abu&s;e of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners.&mdash;2. This was &s;urely very ill timed: the very day after they had been made acquainted with his Maje&s;ty's Command and Expectation that the Commi&s;|&s;ioners &s;hould return to Bo&s;ton and re&s;ume their functi|on, and would return without Re&s;i&s;tance and with Safe|ty, to publi&s;h a Manife&s;to again&s;t them, which as it had nothing new in it could only &s;erve to revive the popular Prejudices again&s;t them, and thereby encourage Re&s;i&s;t|ance, and make their Safety precarious, is unaccounta|ble in Men of this Rank, and incon&s;i&s;tant with their pub|lic Profe&s;&s;ions of their Regard for the King's Service. &mdash;3. This is al&s;o very unrea&s;onable, it being the Day after the Commi&s;&s;ioners had &s;ignified their Apprehen&s;i|ons of Danger in returning to Bo&s;ton, and de&s;ired the Advice of the Council concerning it, and the Council had given their Opinion, that they might return with Safety. For the&s;e Coun&s;ellors who had one Day en|couraged their coming to Town, the very next Day to i&s;&s;ue a Writing under their Hands holding them forth to the People "As Men who&s;e Avarice having &s;mother|ed in their Brea&s;ts every Sentiment of Humanity towards this Province, has impelled them to oppre&s;s it to the utmo&s;t of their Power," is utterly irreconcilable with my ideas of Truth, Ju&s;tice and Humanity, and &s;hocks me the more, as I know that the Wives of two of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who have young Children, did not want to have their Fears increa&s;ed by this Publication.</P>
<P>It would have been unaccountable how &s;o many Per|&s;ons of &s;o re&s;pectable a Station, and many of them of a re&s;pectable Character, could join in &s;igning &s;uch a Pa|per, if we did not con&s;ider that in public and popular Proceedings the Leaders are few and the followers ma|ny; and that the People called upon to &s;ign Papers, frequently act without Con&s;ideration, and &s;ometimes a|gain&s;t their Judgment. And the virulence with which the Commi&s;&s;ioners have been treated &s;eems to be too vi|olent to be the effect of public Zeal only, without the
<PB N="11" REF="011179_0006_0F862C64B1379048" MS="y">
Inteferance of private Animo&s;ity, which at Pre&s;ent I cannot take upon me to account for, I can only con|demn and lament &s;uch Proceedings in a Body for which I have always had and &s;till retain a great Regard.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER I had communicated your Lord&s;hips Let|ter to the Council, I con&s;idered that &s;ome farther Notification of it would be nece&s;&s;ary in regard to what related to the pre&s;ervation of the Peace and the Pro|tection of the Officers of the revenue, e&s;pecially as the Commi&s;&s;ioners had fixed upon this Week for their return to Bo&s;ton. A Proclamation was not thought Proper, as the Bu&s;ine&s;s was in a manner confined to the Town of Bo&s;ton. I therefore thought of a Letter from my&s;elf to the Ju&s;tices of Bo&s;ton, and accordingly drew one up wherein I recited &s;uch part of your Lord&s;hip's Letter as related to them, and their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and thereto added Injunctions and Admonitions of my own. I communi|cated this to the Council la&s;t Wedne&s;day, propo&s;ing, if it had their Approbation, to call the Ju&s;tices together, and deliver it to them by word of Mouth, and then gave them Copies of it. But tho' no exceptions were taken to particulars the whole was objected too &s;trongly for this Rea&s;on; that if they were to con&s;ent to this Letter they &s;hould appear to approve of the Cen&s;ures your Lord&s;hip has pa&s;&s;ed upon the Town, which they would not admit it had de&s;erved. I told them that I would not enter into an Argument which might tend to impeach the Truth or Ju&s;tice of your Lord&s;hip's
<PB N="12" REF="011179_0007_0F862C6602FC1190">
Letter, but I ob&s;erved that both of them were very de|&s;en&s;ible, being founded upon notorious facts, which could not be denied or undoubted.</P>
<P>I then propo&s;ed another method of informing the Ju&s;tices; which was to call the Ju&s;tices together, and after reading &s;uch part of your Lord&s;hip's Letter as re|lated to their Bu&s;ine&s;s. to give them a general Admo|nition concerning their future Conduct. This was ob|jected to, for that an admonition implied a Cen&s;ure. This I an&s;wered by &s;hewing, that they really did de|&s;erve Cen&s;ure, and by declaring that I would u&s;e them tenderly in that Re&s;pect. But I found that I &s;hould never prevail with the Council to <HI>act</HI> in this Bu|&s;ine&s;s: that they would not <HI>advi&s;e</HI> to any method of notifying, enjoyning or enforcing the Orders contained in your Lord&s;hip's Letter; and that I could make no|thing of them but <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> A&s;&s;ociates. I propo&s;ed there|fore that they &s;hould meet in the Council the next morn|ing, and I would of my own accord and without their Advice, order the Ju&s;tices to attend, and would admo|ni&s;h them as I had before propo&s;ed. This was at length a&s;&s;ented to; though not without one Gentleman's pro|te&s;ting again&s;t it. I accordingly the next day a&s;&s;embled the Ju&s;tices and in the pre&s;ence of the Council having cau&s;ed an Extract of your Lord&s;hip's Letter to be read, I entered into a full Explanation of the Nature of their Office and their Duty therein; and avoiding as much as I could, cen&s;uring them for their former Conduct, I &s;hewed what would be expected of them for the future; and I concluded that if they had a mind to retrieve the Credit of the Town, it was not to be done by denying what was pa&s;t, but by regulating what was to come: As &s;oon as I had done, a Gentleman of the Council &s;aid aloud he liked this very well; and the Ju&s;tices &s;eemed &s;atisfied with this proceeding; and &s;everal of them gave a&s;&s;urances that they would do the be&s;t to pre&s;erve the good order of the Town.</P>
<P>The&s;e two conferences with the Council pa&s;&s;ed with good Humour; and in the cour&s;e of them I had an op|portunity to ob&s;erve upon and lament the Servility, in
<PB N="13" REF="011179_0007_0F862C6602FC1190" MS="y">
regard to the People, with which the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Coun|cil was now done in compari&s;on to what u&s;ed to be. This was not denied; and one Gentleman &s;aid, That he did not now enter the Council Chamber with that free Mind he u&s;ed to have: But he liked to be concern|ed in public Bu&s;ine&s;s, and did not chu&s;e to quit his Place in the Council, and therefore mu&s;t be content to hold it upon &s;uch Terms as he could. So fair a con|fe&s;&s;ion de&s;erves not to be pa&s;&s;ed unnoticed. But I &s;hould not trouble your Lord&s;hip with &s;uch trifling Anecdotes if they did not &s;eem to me to be the be&s;t method to convey a true Idea of the pre&s;ent State of this Go|vernment, and to point out the chief cau&s;es of its De|cea&s;e, and I mu&s;t my&s;elf re&s;ort to the cau&s;e I am now treating of, to &s;hew why I have not executed the King's Commands in as full a manner as may be expected from me. But my Lord, the Council them&s;elves have for a|bove four Months pa&s;t taken great pains to &s;hew from whence the imbicility of this Government ari&s;es; and have brought more forcible Arguments, than any one el&s;e could have urged, to &s;hew how nece&s;&s;ary it is be|come that the King &s;hould have the Council Chamber in his own Hands.

<HEAD>Governor Bernard's Letter to the Earl of Hill&s;borough, dated Bo&s;ton,
<DATE>November <HI>14, 1768.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I come now to con&s;ider that part of my Orders which relates to the reforming the bench of Ju&s;tices: This is to be done by two ways, 1. by adding new Ju&s;tices to the pre&s;ent Bench, either by engaging Gentlemen who are already in the Commi&s;&s;ion to qualify them&s;elves,
<PB N="14" REF="011179_0008_0F862C669330FAA8">
or by granting new Commi&s;&s;ions to fit Per&s;ons who will undertake to Act; 2. by removing &s;uch Per&s;ons in the Commi&s;&s;ion who are known to be infected with princi|ples of Di&s;affection to the con&s;titutional Authority of Parliment. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is practicable in both its Branches; the &s;econd is at pre&s;ent ab&s;olutely impracti|cable, and will remain &s;o while the Council make the humouring the People their chief Object.</P>
<P>In regard to the fir&s;t I have already made &s;ome At|tempts to engage &s;ome Gentlemen now in the Commi&s;|&s;ion to qualify them&s;elves, and &s;hall pur&s;ue it; And not|with&s;tanding the Undertaking is very di&s;couraging, I expect I &s;hall have &s;ome Succe&s;s. I have al&s;o made an E&s;&s;ay to appoint new Ju&s;tices who would engage to Act, by naming one very fit Per&s;on. It was receiv'd very cooly by the Council and upon my a&s;king the Rea&s;on, I was told he was not popular; I replied that if he had been I &s;hould not have named him. As he was allow|ed to be in every other Re&s;pect a mo&s;t unexceptionable Man, it pa&s;&s;ed unanimou&s;ly: but it gave me to know what I mu&s;t expect if I propo&s;ed a Man <HI>who was not po|pular</HI> again&s;t whom any Exception could be taken. But I &s;hall try &s;oon again.</P>
<P>As for removing Per&s;ons for their Oppo&s;ition to the Authority of Parliament by means of a Council the ma|jority of which has (indirectly at lea&s;t) avowed the &s;ame Principles, and now appears to Act in Concert with that Party from whence the Oppo&s;ition to Parliament origi|nated, it would be an Attempt contrary to all Rules of Policy and Prudence. It would require to be done by a public Enquiry, which would receive all the Ob&s;truc|tion and embarra&s;&s;ment which the Chicanery of Law could invent; and if after all, full proof of Di&s;affection to the Authority of Parliament &s;hould be made, it would be declared not to be relevant to infer &s;uch a Cen&s;ure. It would be therefore in vain to attempt to puni&s;h Di&s;|affection to the Authority of Parliament, until the Cri|minality is better e&s;tabli&s;hed than it is at pre&s;ent. To &s;upport this Conjecture in what manner the Council would Act in &s;uch a Proceeding, I need only refer your
<PB N="15" REF="011179_0008_0F862C669330FAA8">
Lord&s;hip to their Conduct and the Papers they have publi&s;hed within the&s;e two Months la&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>And yet, My Lord, I would not in&s;inuate that we have no fit Objects for &s;uch a Cen&s;ure; the Sons of Li|berty have not been without Magi&s;trates. We have &s;een Ju&s;tices attending at Liberty tree; One to Admini&s;ter an Oath to the Stamp Ma&s;ter, when he was obliged to &s;wear that he would not execute his Office, Another to perform the Function of Toa&s;t Ma&s;ter; a third, but lately, to con&s;ult about fortifying the Town; others to make up a Proce&s;&s;ion of 45 Carriages and 92 Per&s;ons on the 14th of Augu&s;t la&s;t. All the&s;e are included in two Li&s;ts which your Lord&s;hip has, that of the 5 Selectmen who &s;igned the Circular Letter for the Convention, of which all but the fir&s;t are in the Commi&s;&s;ion, and that of the S Ju&s;tices who &s;igned the Refu&s;al to Pillet the Soldiers. Now if the Cen&s;ure of the&s;e Proceedings &s;hould produce an Order to me to Supercede the Com|mi&s;&s;ions of the&s;e Gentlemen, It would be a Trial of the Power of the Governor: It &s;eems at pre&s;ent that the Council would not enable me to execute &s;uch an Order.</P>
<P>It is a great Defect in this Government that the King has no Power over the Commi&s;&s;ions, which are grant|ed in his Name and under his Seal. He can by Order in Council di&s;allow a Law which has pa&s;&s;ed by the Go|vernor, Council and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; But yet he cannot &s;upercede a Commi&s;&s;ion which has been grant|ed by the Governor and Council. And yet the Coun|cil of this Province is as much out of the Controul of the King as the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives is. Where|fore it &s;eems as rea&s;onable that the King &s;hould be al|lowed to correct the Mi&s;takes of the Governor and Council, as of the Governor, Council and Hou&s;e. As it is, when the Governor has once &s;et the King's Seal to a Commi&s;&s;ion, it is for ever out of the hands of the Crown, and the Per&s;ons who has obtained it may thence|forth defy the King, oppo&s;e his Laws and in&s;ult his Go|vernment and be in no Danger of lo&s;ing his Commi&s;&s;i|on. It is true, the Governor with the Advice of Coun|cil can &s;upercede him; but if he acts in a Popular Cau&s;e,
<PB N="16" REF="011179_0009_0F862C66EB0CBC98">
under which Oppo&s;ition to Government finds it ea&s;y to &s;helter it&s;elf, the Council, who are them&s;elves the crea|tures of the People, will never join with the Governor in cen&s;uring <HI>the overflowings of Liberty.</HI> It may be &s;aid that the Governor &s;hould take care not to appoint any one who&s;e Character is not well known. But the Governor does not per&s;onally know half of tho&s;e whom he appoints to Offices: it is not therefore in his Power to guard again&s;t Impo&s;ition, let him be ever &s;o cauti|ous. Be&s;ides a man's political Caracter often does not appear 'till he is got into an Office and thereby held forth to the Public: Hence it is not unu&s;ual for a Per|&s;on, who has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in Political Matters, to get him&s;elf recommended to the Governor, as a Man well di&s;po&s;ed to Government; and as &s;oon as he has re|ceived his Commi&s;&s;ion to declare for the Party of the Sons of Liberty. The Governor may re&s;ent the Im|po&s;ition as he plea&s;es; but can't undo what he has done. Thus the Commi&s;&s;ions of the King like his Cannon up|on another occa&s;ion, are turned again&s;t him.</P>
<P>It would &s;erve to remedy this abu&s;e and &s;trengthen Government, if the King was enabled by Order in his Privy Council to &s;upercede Commi&s;&s;ions granted in his Name, and under his Seal, when they &s;hall appear to be granted to improper Per&s;ons, or made u&s;e of for impro|per purpo&s;es. This mu&s;t be done by Act of Parlia|ment: and I don't &s;ee the Impropriety of &s;uch an Act; it &s;eems to me to be a proper power to be ve&s;ted in the Crown; e&s;pecially at a time when the Crown wants to be &s;trengthened by all legal means, in this Country. And it &s;eems that it would be better to be done by a ge|neral Act than a partial one; for &s;uch a Power may be wanted in the Royal Governments&punc; notwith&s;tanding the Controul the King has over the Councils. For is is ve|ry po&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering the Spirit which now prevails, that even a Royal Council may &s;upport a Popular Ma|gi&s;trate again&s;t the Intere&s;t of the Crown. And if the Colonies &s;hould prevail to have the Judges Commi&s;&s;ions during good behaviour, which &s;ome of them are now very earne&s;t about, it might be proper that the King in
<PB N="17" REF="011179_0009_0F862C66EB0CBC98" MS="y">
Council &s;hould be empowered to judge and determine upon &s;uch Mi&s;behaviour as would avoid the Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But this will not be nece&s;&s;ary if the general In&s;truc|tions of granting no Commi&s;&s;ions but during Plea&s;ure be continued and ob&s;erved; nor will it be nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch an Act &s;hould be general; It is more wanted in this Government than in all the others together: and even hear the Defect would be cured by a Royal Council.</P>

<DATE>Nov. <HI>30, 1768.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Think it proper to inform your Lord&s;hip that I com|municated to the Council that part of your Lord|&s;hip's Letter N^o. 19, in which your Lord&s;hip &s;ignified his Maje&s;ty's gracious Reception of the Petition of the Council, which I tran&s;mitted in July la&s;t, and added, that the Petition with my rea&s;oning in &s;upport of it would have full Con&s;ideration. Upon which Mr. Bowdoin who has all along taken the Lead of the Council in their late extraordinary proceedings, charged me with having mi&s;repre&s;ented the purpo&s;e of their Petition, by taking Advantage of an Expre&s;&s;ion of theirs, "drawing a Revenue from the Colonies," and there from in&s;inu|ating that their Objection lay not &s;o much again&s;t the rai&s;ing money, as the carrying it out of the Country and not expending it here. And to Ju&s;tify this, he quoted a tran&s;itory Conver&s;ation he had with me on the day of the Public Commencement at the College in Ju|ly la&s;t. I told him that if the Conver&s;ation had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon him, is was a pity he had not mentioned it before. Whil&s;t my Memory could inter|po&s;e in my behalf. That at this di&s;tance of time 5
<PB N="18" REF="011179_0010_0F862C67A76E0A38">
months, I could not recollect every trifling Conver&s;ati|on; for &s;uch I was a&s;&s;ured this was from his Report of it. But I could be certain whether I had or had not mi&s;repre&s;ented their Petition by in&s;pecting my own Books. And before I looked at them, I could declare that I had not.</P>
<P>My Letter Books were at my Country Hou&s;e, where I generally write all my Letters. As &s;oon as I got at them, I had the Letter in Que&s;tion, N^o, 11. July 16. copied: And as &s;oon as I returned to Town, I read that part of it which related to this Bu&s;ine&s;s to three or four of the Council; and I let two of them and the Se|cretary read the whole Letter; they were greatly &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find it &s;o very clear of Mr. Bowdoin's charge, at the next Council I produced the Letter and read the whole Pa&s;&s;age referred to: from whence it appeared that in mentioning the Prayer of their Petition, I u&s;ed their own words without adding a &s;ingle word of my own: and al&s;o that the Argument I u&s;ed in behalf of the Pray|er went again&s;t Taxation in general, more than the Di&s;po&s;al of the money: This appeared &s;atisfactory to the whole Council except Mr. Bowdoin. But he &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in ju&s;tifying him&s;elf mentioned &s;omething more of the Conver&s;ation referred to which explained the whole, and &s;howed that what I &s;aid upon that occa&s;ion was entirely in Joke. This was confirmed by a Coun|cellor, who recollected that on that day, being a day of Fe&s;tivity, I did joke with &s;ome of them upon their Petition, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as Mr. Bowdoin quoted, but in Terms that one could not have imagined could have been taken &s;eriou&s;ly, and really were quite inoffen|&s;ive to every one el&s;e.</P>
<P>This is a very trifling matter to trouble your Lord|&s;hip with: but it has already been the &s;ubject of De|bates in Council, and Libels in the News-papers. It would have have al&s;o produced a formal Remon&s;trance to your Lord&s;hip, which I am told was actually pre|pared by the Gentlemen who made the charge, if it had not been prevented by my making Communications which, but for &s;aving Trouble to your Lord&s;hip, I
<PB N="19" REF="011179_0010_0F862C67A76E0A38" MS="y">
would not have &s;ubmitted to. But it will vent it&s;elf in another and more public way; of which I &s;hall be a|ble to give your Lord&s;hip an Account in a few days. Your Lord&s;hip may depend upon it that my Informati|ons have been and &s;hall be dictated by the Spirit of Truth and Candour: but I cannot make Facts other than they are, nor can I excu&s;e my&s;elf communicating &s;uch Ob&s;ervations and Reflections as occur to me, and appear to be material to the Subject.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Council have been for a week pa&s;t preparing Petitions to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament again&s;t the American Acts of Revenue, that is, as I under&s;tand, again&s;t all the Acts impo&s;ing Port Duties. They &s;ig|nified their intention to me, and de&s;ired that I would either join with them, or authorize their &s;itting for that purpo&s;e. I reminded them that I had refu&s;ed to be con|cerned in this Bu&s;ine&s;s in July la&s;t, and the impropriety of this Mea&s;ure was much &s;tronger now than then. I added, that if they would be advi&s;ed by me, they would not pur&s;ue this intention: which could do no good and might turn to evil; that if the Parliament was di&s;po&s;ed to indulge the Americans in another Repeal, there were Petitions enough before them to ground it upon; and their Petition at be&s;t would be but a Makeweight; on the other hand it might contain &s;omething that might give Offence, and add to the Ill humour which I fear|ed already prevailed again&s;t this Province. But all this and more had no Effect: The movers of this Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="011179_0011_0F862C6865A6AC00">
called the Council together &s;eperatety from the Gover|nor in the Council Chamber according to the new me|thod, for which they apologized in the Petition. After &s;everal days Meeting, the Petition was &s;ettled and ap|proved: Upon which there was a di&s;pute how it &s;hould be &s;igned, whether by every one as private Per&s;ons as in the Addre&s;s to General Gage, or by the Pre&s;ident in the name of the Body; in which latter Ca&s;e they mu&s;t be under&s;tood to act as the Legi&s;lative Council, there being no Pre&s;ident of the Privy Council but the Gover|nor. However it was re&s;olved it &s;hould be &s;ignified in the latter way.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I Learned it was fini&s;hed, I &s;ent for Mr. Danforth the Pre&s;ident, and de&s;ired to &s;ee it: he went and procured it for me. I found it was &s;igned "in the name and by the order of a Majority of the Council S. Danforth." Mr. Danforth &s;aid he was not pre&s;ent when this manner of &s;igning was re&s;olved upon; and when he &s;at his name to it, he did not &s;et the word "Pre&s;ident" after his name: this was a poor Excu&s;e, but &s;erves to &s;how how little free Agency there is in a Bu&s;ine&s;s of this kind: He al&s;o added that if he could get the Council to meet again, he was in hopes they would undo this Bu|&s;ine&s;s; for &s;everal of them had &s;ignified their Di&s;appro|bation of it. But I had no &s;uch Expectation; for the Council is brought under &s;uch an awe of their Con&s;ti|tuents by the frequent Removals of the Friends of Go|vernment, that there is very little Exerci&s;e for private Judgment in popular Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>If by the Majority of the Council, in who&s;e name the Pre&s;ident is to &s;ign, they mean a Majority of the whole Board, I cannot conceive that all the Per&s;ons who met at the &s;everal Meetings upon this Occa&s;ion put together amount to the Number 12, which is the Majority of the whole. But if they mean a Majority of tho&s;e pre&s;ent when the Re&s;olution was formed, it may fall very &s;hort of the Majority of the Body: Four Per&s;ons will make a Majority of a Quorum of the Council. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e I doubt whether the Number of tho&s;e who really approved of this Mea&s;ure was much more: For it &s;eem|ed
<PB N="21" REF="011179_0011_0F862C6865A6AC00">
to be rather &s;ubmitted to than joined in. As for the Petition it&s;elf, it is very lengthy, being &s;ix Folio Pages, but has nothing new in it, nothing I believe, but what is to be found among the Writings of the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives. It differs from the Petition to the King in this: The latter carefully avoids all Claim of Right again&s;t the Parliament; this is not &s;o clear of it: It has indeed no po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertions of Right, but &s;everal Intimations of it too plain to be unnoticed. This Ac|count is taken only from once reading it, and therefore may not be free from Mi&s;takes, tho' I believe it is right as to the general Idea.</P>

And tho' Lieutenant Colonel Dairymple had done every thing in his Power previous to my Arrival to procure Quarters for the two Regiments from Hallifax, I found one of tho&s;e Regi|ments
<PB N="22" REF="011179_0012_0F862C69261A97C8">
encamped, and the other lodged in the Market-Hall.</P>
<P>I immediately made Application in Per&s;on to the Go|vernor in Council, that the Troops might have Quar|ters in the public Hou&s;es, as far as they could be Ac|commodated therein, and that Orders might be given for that Purpo&s;e to the inferior Magi&s;trates: and that Out Hou&s;es, &amp;c. might be prepared for the remainder; to which I Begged a deci&s;ive An&s;wer, that I might fall upon Mea&s;ures to put the Troops under Cover, as the Winter approached.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found that the Council had put a Con&s;truction upon the Mutiny Act for North-America, which ren|dered it of no Effect, for the Purpo&s;es of Marching and Quartering the Troops, viz.
<Q>That whatever Place in a Province the King's Troops &s;hould be ordered to, they could not be Quartered in that Place, 'till all the Barracks in the Province, however di&s;tant from it, were fir&s;t filled with Troops;</Q> from thence the Council inferred, that no Quarters could be had in the Town, till the Barracks in Ca&s;tle I&s;land were filled; and further, that the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Quartering did not come properly before them, but in the la&s;t In&s;tance, when not only the Barracks in Que&s;tion, but al&s;o the public Hou&s;es &s;hould be filled with Troops, which be|longed to the Magi&s;trates to do, and was an affair that did not belong to them; It was in vain to &s;et forth that the Barracks in Ca&s;tle I&s;land would be occupied by the Troops expected from Ireland, or to urge the ab|&s;urdity of a Con&s;truction of the Act of Parliament, which annihilated the Act; as it ab&s;olutely impeded the March of the Troops thro' the Province, as well as the King's Right to order his Troops to any Town or Vil|lage where his Service might require them to be order|ed to</P>
<P>The next Step to be taken was, to make Application to the Magi&s;trates, to Quarter the Troops in the Pub|lic Hou&s;es; and a Que&s;tion aro&s;e, who were the Magi|&s;trates? The Select-Men refu&s;ed being concerned, and declared they were not Magi&s;trates, which was agreed
<PB N="23" REF="011179_0012_0F862C69261A97C8">
to; and it then became nece&s;&s;ary to apply to the Ju&s;ti|ces of the Peace, the Difficulty then was, to find any of the Ju&s;tices who would act in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Billeting, and &s;ome of them were to be tried, who gave A&s;&s;urances of their readine&s;s to carry on the King's Service, but &s;aid it was hard, that they only &s;hould be pitched upon for &s;uch an undertaking, and to become the Objects of public Odium, when there were &s;o many more Ju&s;tices in the Town, to take their Share of it. This produc|ed a Re&s;olution to a&s;&s;emble all the Ju&s;tices of the Town, and I attended Governor Bernard to their Meeting, where he required it of them conjunctly, and of each &s;e|perately, to Billet the Troops in the Public Hou&s;es, ac|cording to the Act of Parliament: they de&s;ired Time to con&s;ider of a Mea&s;ure which they &s;aid mu&s;t be very di&s;|agreeable to the People, and might be attended with bad Con&s;equences. After &s;ome days Con&s;ideration, they returned for An&s;wer, that the Act did not require them to Quarter Troops, or words to that Effect.</P>
<P>I relate the above Tran&s;actions to your Lord&s;hip, in a &s;ummary Way, leaving it to Governor Bernard to tran&s;mit to your Lord&s;hip, the particular Re&s;olves of his Council at their &s;everal Meetings on the Subject of providing Quarters as well as a Copy of the Re&s;olution of the Ju&s;tices upon the &s;ame Subject.</P>
<P>There was no Di&s;appointment in the bad Succe&s;s of the&s;e &s;everal Applications; it was known before hand that they would have no Effect; but it was proper to try, to get the Laws enforced. Governor Bernard therefore agreed in the Nece&s;&s;ity of making Preparati|ons to put the Troops under Cover, by hiring of emp|ty Hou&s;es, or other Buildings proper for the Purpo&s;e, and that a particular Account &s;hould be kept of the Expences incurred therein, as al&s;o of all Nece&s;&s;aries required in Quartering, that the Governor may require a Reim|bur&s;ement of the &s;ame, from the fir&s;t A&s;&s;embly, that &s;hall be Summoned to meet. But as it may be uncertain where the Expence will fall in the End, I have endea|voured to have every Thing prepared, with as much Frugality as po&s;&s;ible, and the King's Barrack Ma&s;ter is
<PB N="24" REF="011179_0013_0F862C69ED58CF78">
ordered to repair here from Hallifax with all the &s;pare Bedding and Uten&s;ils in tho&s;e Stores, and a large quan|tity of Coals, carried thither by the Troops from Lou|i&s;bourg.</P>
<P>The Council after &s;ome time, gave Governor Ber|nard a power over the Barracks at Ca&s;tle I&s;land as well as over a public Building in the Town, called the Ma|nufactory Hou&s;e: The Barracks are &s;aid to have been built, to hold one thou&s;and Men, but I find they were only temporary Lodgments for Soldiers during the la&s;t War, before they embarked, and the &s;hort time they &s;taid, made it immaterial whether they were crowded or not. I find upon examination they will not hold above one Regiment, upon the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, and that by putting 12 Men in a Room of 18 Feet &s;quare. As for the Manufactory Hou&s;e, there are People in it who have been &s;pirited up to maintain Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome Mea&s;ures were taken, tho' without Effect, to re|move them, which occa&s;ioned a little Di&s;turbance of no Con&s;equence, and only &s;erved to &s;how a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate &s;pirit of Oppo&s;ition to every mea&s;ure of Government. When the Regiments arrive from Ireland, one of them will be quartered in the Barracks in Ca&s;tle I&s;land, and the other mu&s;t be lodged in the Town, in the &s;ame man|ner as the two Regiments from Hallifax.</P>
<P>Ca&s;tle William remains garri&s;on'd by the Company kept up by the Province, and I find there is a Provin|cial military E&s;tabli&s;hment &s;upported there, under the Command of the Governor, of &s;ome U&s;e and Emolu|ment to him and the Lieutenant-Governor, upon that account, and not &s;eeing any ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for it, I have not interfered in any Matters concerning the Fort, or in&s;i&s;ted on putting a Garri&s;on of the King's Troops into it. But if the King &s;hould incline to make any al|teration in the di&s;po&s;itions of his Forces, by &s;tationing one or two Regiments in this Province for the time to come, his Maje&s;ty may think it right to put Ca&s;tle Wil|liam into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own Troops; but as in that Ca&s;e, I apprehend the Province would grant no Funds to maintain it, the Expence thereof will fall up|on
<PB N="25" REF="011179_0013_0F862C69ED58CF78">
the Crown. The Fort may be made to contain two or thee Companies of Foot, and a Detachment of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. But as for the Barracks near it, &s;ituated on a &s;mall I&s;land, where there is not room for Troops to move, and at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the Town of Bo&s;ton, they will not an&s;wer any de&s;ign or purpo&s;e of &s;tationing Troops there for the &s;ervice of the Town. And if any Number of Troops &s;hould be fixed in this Province, I would take the liberty to pro|po&s;e, that Barracks &s;hould be built for them within the Town, on a vacant Spot called Fort-Hill, an advan|tageous Situation, whereon a Fort formerly &s;tood; and Governor Bernard tells me it belongs to the Crown. A new Fort may hereafter be erected there, if his Maje&s;ty's Affairs &s;hould require it.</P>
<P>Every Art and Eva&s;ion has been tried by the major part of the People of every Degree, to force the Troops to quit the Town for want of Quarters, whil&s;t tho&s;e, who may have acted or made known their Sentiments in favor of Government declared they dur&s;t not &s;tay in the Town, but mu&s;t remove with their Families and Effects, if the Troops &s;hould leave it. When the Hou&s;es where ready to receive the Troops, the Officers were threatned with the Clau&s;e of the Mutiny Act again&s;t Officers, who pre&s;ume to take upon them&s;elves to quarter Troops, &amp;c and to prevent their being put to any trou|ble on that account by perverting the Act in that parti|cular, as had been done in &s;o many others, Governor Ber|nard gave a particular Warrant to a Commi&s;&s;ary, again&s;t. whom no Action could lye, to quarter the Soldiers in the Hou&s;es fitted up for their Reception. I would take the liberty, my Lord, to repre&s;ent, that the Clau&s;e in que&s;tion is by no means calculated for the Circum&s;tances of this Country, where every Man &s;tudies Law, and in|terprets the Laws as &s;uits his purpo&s;es, and where the Mea&s;ures of Government are oppo&s;ed by every Eva&s;ion and Chicane that can be devi&s;ed. An Officer, of Rank and long Service may be ca&s;hiered by the management of two Ju&s;tices of the Peace, the be&s;t of them the Keep|er of a paltry Tavern, who &s;hall find Eva&s;ions to di&s;o|bey
<PB N="26" REF="011179_0014_0F862C6AB3BE3740">
the Clau&s;es of the Mutiny Act, which they di&s;like, and to pervert the Sen&s;e and Meaning of others to &s;erve their De&s;igns again&s;t him, and unhappily it might be found in &s;ome Places, that tho&s;e who &s;hould rever&s;e ini|quitous Convictions of Ju&s;tices of the Peace, were no better than the Ju&s;tices who &s;hould have granted the Certificates of Conviction. I troubled his Maje&s;ty's Se|cretary at War &s;ome time ago with &s;ome very unwar|rantable Proceedings again&s;t an Officer on account of the Clau&s;e in que&s;tion, which happened to the South|ward.</P>
<P>After other Methods had been tried to get the Troops away. I received an Addre&s;s from a number of Gentle|men Members of the Council, in which they aim at ju&s;|tifying the People again&s;t many Mi&s;repre&s;entations of their Conduct, blaming the Commi&s;&s;ioners of his Maje&s;|ty's Cu&s;toms, and begging the Troops may be with|drawn from the Town. I have the honor to tran&s;mit your Lord&s;hip the Addre&s;s and An&s;wer thereto.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who would ju&s;tify or rather palliate the Pro|ceedings of the People here, complain, that they have been gro&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented, and every little Di&s;turbance that has happened, been magnified into dangerous Riots; that the Di&s;turbance in March was trifling, that of the 10th of June was occa&s;ioned &s;olely by the Imprudence of the Commi&s;&s;ioners: they excu&s;e the Re&s;olves made at the Town Meetings, by attributing them only to the extravagance of a few mad People, and aver that the Convention was called with no other Intent, than to take proper Mea&s;ures, to pre&s;erve the Peace and Tranquility of the Province.</P>
<P>I am to ob&s;erve upon the above, that according to the be&s;t Information I have been able to procure, the Di&s;|turbance in March was trifling, that con&s;idering what had happened re&s;pecting Seizures, the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms had Rea&s;on to act as they did, re&s;pecting the Seizure which occa&s;ioned the Riots on the 10th of June which was con&s;iderable; and tho' I do not find that they were, at that time per&s;onally attacked, yet the A&s;&s;ault upon &s;ome of their Officers, and the threats
<PB N="27" REF="011179_0014_0F862C6AB3BE3740">
daily thrown out again&s;t them&s;elves was certainly a &s;uf|ficient Rea&s;on to make them apprehen&s;ive of Danger to their own Per&s;ons. Whether any harm would have ac|tually happened to them, had they remained in the Town, it is not po&s;&s;ible to judge. With re&s;pect to the Re&s;olves procured by &s;ome mad People at the Town Meetings, tho&s;e mad People have governed the Town, and influenced the Province, a very long Time, and after Publi&s;hing their very dangerous Re&s;olves in the Town Meeting of the 13th of September la&s;t, carried the Motion for convening Deputies from the &s;everal Towns; and the Deputies convened accordingly. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve on this that their intentions were &s;u&s;|picious, and that I am happy, the Troops from Halifax arrived at the time they did.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms are &s;till in Ca&s;tle William, and upon being a&s;ked about their Return to Bo&s;ton, one of them &s;aid, there were Troops now to &s;upport them, but de&s;ired to know if there was any, or what Civil Officer, who would undertake to a&s;k the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Troops, if there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion for it. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor were pre|&s;ent, but neither could be an&s;werable that any Civil Of|ficer would undertake it.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will naturally imagine that &s;ince the Troops are here to &s;upport the Dignity of Government and a due Execution of the Laws that the Powers of Government are reverted into the Hands, where the Con&s;titution has Placed them, and that the Civil Offi|cers would immediately avail them&s;elves of &s;o good an Opportunity to re&s;tore Affairs to their proper Order, and put the Laws in Execution, again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould dare to violate them; This is not yet the Ca&s;e, and it is plainly &s;een even among&s;t the few Magi&s;trates, of whom it is &s;aid, that they have a real Wi&s;h, and de&s;ire to &s;upport Government, and do their Duty, that there is a fear of acting contrary to the general Sentiments of their Fellow Citizens, and a de&s;ire to maintain a cer|tain degree of Popularity among&s;t them, which prevents them from being particular in the Execution of their
<PB N="28" REF="011179_0015_0F862C6BE7A72B38">
Offices: All now hoped for is, that things being in a more quiet &s;tate than they were, the violent Temper of the People will abate in a little time&punc; and their Minds be more compo&s;ed, when the Magi&s;trates may do their Duty with le&s;s fear of becoming obnoxious to the Peo|ple; the Town has been under a kind of Democratical De&s;poti&s;m for a con&s;iderable time, and it has not been &s;afe for People to act, or &s;peak contrary to the Senti|ments of the ruling Demagogues; and &s;urprizing as it may appear, tho&s;e fears are not yet annihilated.</P>
<P>If it is a&s;ked, why the Governor does not turn all the Ju&s;tices of Peace out of Commi&s;&s;ion, and put others in, who will do their Duty? It is an&s;wered, that the Go|vernor can neither appoint Ju&s;tices, or turn them out, but by con&s;ent of Council; and that the Council op|po&s;es every thing propo&s;ed to the Governor, for the Ser|vice of Government, that is unpopular.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, Your Lord&s;hip will con|clude, that there is no Government in Bo&s;ton, there is in truth very little at pre&s;ent, and the Con&s;titution of this Province leans &s;o much to the Side of Democracy, that the Governor has not the power to remedy the di&s;|orders which happen in it.</P>
<CLOSER>I have the Honour to be with the greate&s;t Re&s;pect, Regard and E&s;teem 
<SALUTE>my Lord,</SALUTE>
