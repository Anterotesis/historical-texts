</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE occa&s;ion of our being collected to wor&s;hip GOD is one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn that can be conceived. This day is appointed to clo&s;e the life of an unhappy per&s;on, who is con|demned for con&s;piring again&s;t his country and all its privileges. He hath been judged by men in righteou&s;ne&s;s, the &s;entence of death pronounced, the day of execution come; an event indeed awful, and affecting to every mind of humanity or religion. Though ju&s;tice to our country and reverence for its laws, forbids any thing that would impede a full execution of them; there is room for prayer to ALMIGHTY GOD that this days bu&s;ine&s;s may be ble&s;&s;ed for our good, and that the unhappy criminal may receive the forgivene&s;s of his &s;ins from GOD, though he cannot have for|givene&s;s from the State, con&s;i&s;tent with public &s;afety.</P>
<P>FOR rea&s;ons, we mu&s;t in charity hope, hone&s;t to him&s;elf, he refu&s;es to be pre&s;ent at this &s;olemnity; my di&s;cour&s;e therefore will not be calculated, as hath been u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions, for a dying creature who is to appear immediately before the GREAT
<PB N="6" REF="015607_0004_0F99DBA25F5C2ED8">
JUDGE: but to a&s;&s;i&s;t my hearers in making an improvement of the event, for their own benefit.</P>
<P>THE text from which I di&s;cour&s;e, is a direction of the apo&s;tle Paul to Timothy, for executing his mini&s;terial power with digni|ty; and for conducting the puni&s;hments that &s;hould be inflicted on offenders, in &s;uch manner, that all might derive benefit from them. Them, who &s;in &s;o as to make puni&s;hment nece&s;&s;ary, re|buke before all, that others may be deterred when they &s;ee the danger of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion&mdash;the infamy and mi&s;ery in which the di&s;o|bedient are finally involved.</P>
<P>THIS &s;acred precept, though written originally to direct the church in its proceedings again&s;t offenders, may be applied with equal propriety to civil government. Several rea&s;ons for the pu|ni&s;hment of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion are the &s;ame, both in the church of CHRIST, and in the civil &s;tate; and there are the &s;ame rea&s;ons that it &s;hould be publicly inflicted&mdash;that others may fear and be guarded again&s;t temptation. If all men had faith in the perfecti|ons and government of JEHOVAH, and loved him with chri&s;tian affection, there would be no di&s;po&s;ition to do unrea&s;onable things; no other principles of obedience, would be nece&s;&s;ary to maintain good order, holine&s;s and virtue. That all men have not faith, are not di&s;po&s;ed to live peaceably and ju&s;tly, we know from the word of GOD, and from daily experience&mdash;Such is the degene|racy of human nature, that we need every motive which can be adduced in favor of virtue&mdash;every principle and pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul, mu&s;t be &s;kilfully addre&s;&s;ed to promote an habitual abhor|rence of the&s;e things, which the LORD hateth on account of their unrea&s;onablene&s;s&mdash;of the di&s;honor they bring on his laws and go|vernment &mdash;and the damage done to mankind.</P>
<P>THE event which calls us together is an awful and affecting de|mon&s;tration, of the danger of &s;in&mdash;a warning to hold our pa&s;&s;ions and appetites in con&s;tant &s;ubjection to rea&s;on&mdash;to cultivate fixed
<PB N="7" REF="015607_0005_0F99DBA26E38C768">
principles of hone&s;ty, ju&s;tice and benevolence&mdash;to be con&s;cienti|ou&s;ly &s;trict in obeying the laws of GOD, and our country.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to con&s;ider the following points.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;ons why it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;in &s;hould be publicly rebuked and puni&s;hed by civil government.&mdash;The infamy and mi&s;ery which the wicked bring on them&s;elves in this world, by tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing the good laws of GOD and man.&mdash;The importance of be|ing con&s;tantly guarded, le&s;t inadvertently we plunge into de&s;|truction.</P>
<P>I AM fir&s;t to con&s;ider &s;ome rea&s;ons, why it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;in &s;hould be publicly puni&s;hed by civil government The mo&s;t im|portant are, the glory of GOD&mdash;the &s;afety of mankind&mdash;and that others may be deterred from wickedne&s;s by the example.&mdash;Each of the&s;e con&s;iderations warrant the &s;everity of human laws again&s;t iniquity.</P>
<P>NATURAL religion and chri&s;tianity require us vi&s;ibly to exalt and glorify the MOST HIGH by all po&s;&s;ible means. This duty is equally incumbent on individuals, and on public &s;ocieties; for both are pre&s;erved by his providence, and under &s;olemn ob|ligations in their proper character to dignify his name and go|vernment, reverence his laws, and exert their whole influence for the &s;upport of virtue. In the holy &s;criptures, GOD often ad|dre&s;&s;es civil &s;ocieties in their national character&mdash;reproves their vices&mdash;points out their danger&mdash;and promi&s;es public ble&s;&s;ings as a reward of vi&s;ible morality, and of care to celebrate the honor of his name, and obedience to his laws.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT is a divine in&s;titution, equally de&s;igned to encourage tho&s;e virtues GOD commands; as to &s;upport the temporal intere&s;ts of mankind. The particular mode is left to be determined by human wi&s;dom; but the in&s;titution is divine.</P>
<P>RULERS and judges of nations are called the mini&s;ters of GOD,
<PB N="8" REF="015607_0006_0F99DBA32DF3C758">
for good unto men; and if mini&s;ters of GOD ALMIGHTY, certain|ly bound to con&s;ult his vi&s;ible glory. How can nations, their rulers and laws pay any re&s;pect unto the DEITY, unle&s;s they en|courage morality, and publicly puni&s;h the iniquities he hath pro|hibited? Is it not a part of national holine&s;s to frown on vi&s;ible &s;in, and cha&s;ti&s;e the tran&s;actions, which di&s;honor him by whom States are pre&s;erved or de&s;troyed? Doth not gratitude to the glo|rious pre&s;erver of empires direct, that the ungodly and unrigh|teous &s;hould be puni&s;hed, and the friends of religion, good order and their country protected by its power. I have &s;ometimes heard the idea of national obligations to promote GOD's vi&s;ible honor derided; but if it is not thus, can conceive of no rea&s;ons why mankind are addre&s;&s;ed, warned, threatned and encouraged in that character.</P>
<P>THE &s;afety of mankind, is a &s;econd rea&s;on, why &s;in &s;hould be puni&s;hed by the power of the State.</P>
<P>THE law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation implanted in the mind by its cre|ator, many times obliges &s;ocieties to exerci&s;e &s;everity for their own defence. All men are &s;inful, and &s;ome &s;o horridly wicked &mdash;&s;o much influenced by covetou&s;ne&s;s, envy and malice&mdash;&s;o de&s;|titute of hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice, humanity and benevolence&mdash;&s;o cruel to their neighbours and their country, as not to he&s;itate at any thing which will promote a temporary intere&s;t of their own, what|ever mi&s;ery may be brought thereby on others. Every wicked per&s;on is an enemy to GOD and man&mdash;inclined to gratify him&s;elf at the expence of their rights, prerogatives and exi&s;tence. Every &s;inful di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;all the practices of iniquity, in their nature imply danger to mankind&mdash;are pointed again&s;t the peace, privi|leges, and deare&s;t intere&s;ts of the world; &s;o that &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, were there no other rea&s;ons, &s;hould induce States to di&s;courage &s;in by puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>WERE there time for a particular enquiry, it might ea&s;ily be
<PB N="9" REF="015607_0007_0F99DBA45BDFAA78">
made evident that the di&s;po&s;itions, pa&s;&s;ions and practices, which are denominated &s;inful, are in their nature ho&s;tile to ALMIGHTY GOD, and to exi&s;tence generally. Hence the &s;afety of mankind requires, that puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted on tho&s;e, who will not be re&s;trained by mildne&s;s from injuring their fellow-men. Is it not rea&s;onable&mdash;is it not ju&s;t, that tho&s;e who have not the fear of GOD, who are not re&s;trained by their own con&s;ciences, &s;hould be obliged by puni&s;hment to con&s;ider &s;in immediately dangerous to them&s;elves? Is it not proper that tho&s;e, who by their actions &s;hew a fixed de&s;ign again&s;t &s;ociety&mdash;a de&s;ire to involve it in the mo&s;t awful calamities, death or what is wor&s;e, the torments of &s;la|very; &s;hould be cut off from the earth, and thereby prevented an opportunity of executing the intended mi&s;chief. The revealed law of GOD warrants this proceeding, and enjoins on civil &s;tates the pre&s;ervation of their intere&s;ts, liberties and exi&s;tence, when it cannot be done otherwi&s;e, by cutting off the offenders from a|mong men. If there were need of ju&s;tifying the divine law, it might ea&s;ily be done from the experience of ages and hi&s;tory of the whole world. Human nature hath always been found &s;uch&mdash; that where law and government &s;o far lo&s;t their energy, as not to be able to puni&s;h offenders; a numerous &s;warm of unju&s;t per|&s;ons, murderers, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and tyrants have immediately appeared to indulge their lu&s;t and &s;atiate their cruelty in the blood of in|nocence. This leads us to</P>
<P>A THIRD rea&s;on, why puni&s;hment &s;hould be publicly inflicted on the wicked&mdash;that others may &s;ee and fear. This principle hath mighty influence in pre&s;erving that regularity, good order, hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among mankind. I do not wi&s;h to calumniate human nature, or repre&s;ent it more wicked, than it really is; but is it not probable&mdash;is it not certain, that if the re|&s;traint of fear were wholly taken off the world would exhibit a &s;cene of confu&s;ion, of cruelty, of helli&s;h wickedne&s;s unparellelled by all di&s;criptions that have been given. Have we not, my chri&s;|tian
<PB N="10" REF="015607_0008_0F99DBA4A7F1FB90">
hearers, often felt our&s;elves re&s;trained by this principle? Should we not have done many more evil things, had not fear of men's indignation prevented? Sometimes we have feared the lo&s;s of reputation&mdash;&s;ometimes of intere&s;t&mdash;&s;ometimes the more awful puni&s;hments inflicted by public ju&s;tice. Even tho&s;e who gene|rally appear to be hone&s;t, well-meaning per&s;ons, are at certain times &s;o much influenced by pa&s;&s;ion and appetite; that they would commit horrid evils, were they not re&s;trained by fear of the con&s;equences. For this rea&s;on it hath always been e&s;teemed proper, that puni&s;hments &s;hould be inflicted in the mo&s;t public manner po&s;&s;ible&mdash;they are a warning, a &s;olemn lecture to all who &s;ee and hear them, and &s;peak with the greate&s;t energy,
<Q>watch and pray, le&s;t you enter into temptation,</Q>
and commit tho&s;e evils which men mu&s;t puni&s;h in this world for their own &s;afety, and GOD ALMIGHTY in the other for the glory of his ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>WE will proceed to the &s;econd branch of di&s;cour&s;e. The in|famy and mi&s;ery which the wicked bring on them&s;elves in this world, by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the good laws of GOD and man.</P>
<P>EVERY violation of the divine law, and the righteous laws of &s;ociety is a moral evil&mdash;an abu&s;e of rea&s;on; and is intimately con|nected with &s;uch natural evils and mi&s;eries, as are dreadful to be endured. Were we to be influenced by no motives but the peace and happine&s;s of this world&punc; we ought to be holy and virtuous in all our conduct&mdash;temperate in our indulgencies&mdash;ju&s;t, hone&s;t, faithful and benevolent in all connections with individuals and our country. All kinds of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which can be menti|oned, draw after them a horrid train of mi&s;eries, &s;ufficient to ter|rify the bolde&s;t mind, when they are realized and felt. Iniquity hath often a gaudy covering, which glitters at a di&s;tance and de|ceives the unwarry into an opinion real happine&s;s is there &mdash;walk with it&mdash;embrace it&mdash;bring it home to the bo&s;om, and it is death. Sin is only another name for mi&s;ery. So GOD's holy word hath warned us, &s;o experience hath taught from the beginning of days,
<PB N="11" REF="015607_0009_0F99DBA777A68560">
yet <HI>fools indeed!</HI> we &s;eek its indulgencies, and court its gains, at the expence of life. The apo&s;tle mentions three principal idols, to which the wicked &s;acrifice, <HI>&s;en&s;uality, covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>ambition.</HI> Their votaries, in&s;tead of finding the expected happine&s;s, plunge them&s;elves into <HI>mi&s;ery, lo&s;s</HI> and <HI>infamy.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT be the natural con&s;equences of indulging the animal affections and appetites, in wantonne&s;s and &s;en&s;uality? Do they not produce pain and woe&mdash;a crazy body, loaded with ill-hu|mours, tormented with anxiety, and thick &s;own with the &s;eeds of death&mdash;a con&s;titution bending over the grave at an untimely age by the weight of iniquity. What be the fruits of fal&s;hood, fraud, inju&s;tice and cruelty? Should they be &s;ecreted from man|kind in general, which is impo&s;&s;ible to be done any con&s;iderable time; yet they deprive the mind of that peace and &s;erenity, which is better than life&mdash;they create a guilty accu&s;er within, from which it is impo&s;&s;ible to flee: and when detected by the world, cha|racter and the confidence of others is forever lo&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEREVER the guilty per&s;on goes, he is e&s;teemed dangerous &mdash;in whatever character he acts, contemptible&mdash;in whatever bu|&s;ine&s;s engaged, jealou&s;y watches him, detects his ba&s;ene&s;s, and &s;hould he chance to do an hone&s;t action, brands it with a fal&s;e con&s;truction. Every one judges him de&s;igning &s;ome mi&s;chief, plotting &s;ome ba&s;e, unrighteous advantage to him&s;elf, by the &s;poil of his neighbours, and de&s;truction of his country. How awful the &s;ituation! to be e&s;teemed an enemy to mankind, and treated with that mortifying cautiou&s;ne&s;s, which is u&s;ed when dealing with one e&s;teemed to be a di&s;hone&s;t and wicked per&s;on.</P>
<P>This infamy, and ill opinion which we are obliged to entertain of the per&s;on, who deals in fraud, inju&s;tice and cruelty, is an evil greatly to be dreaded&mdash;to be cut off from the confidence of man|kind, excluded the &s;ocial delights of virtue, and ju&s;tly marked out an enemy to our neighbours and our country is bitter as death.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="015607_0010_0F99DBA90B0B4540">THE unhappine&s;s is &s;till more encrea&s;ed by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, which every &s;uch per&s;on mu&s;t have unle&s;s given up by GOD to &s;in|gular impenitence, that he merits all the odium thrown upon him. <HI>The feelings of guilt are a death to the mind.</HI> Cain di&s;|cribed them truly, "<HI>every one that findeth me, &s;hall &s;lay me.</HI>" Whatever be the crime, there is &s;omething of this nature in all guilty feelings.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;equences, lo&s;s of health, of reputation, of the friend&s;hip of mankind, of &s;acred &s;ocial plea&s;ures, of public con|fidence, of peace in our minds, naturally flow from indulging the appetites, and violating the ju&s;t laws of GOD and our country. Are they not &s;ufficient to deter every per&s;on from meddling with the my&s;teries of iniquity; and <HI>the greater half</HI> of its danger re|mains yet untold. Frequently it arre&s;ts life cuts &s;hort the time of probation and introduces to the ju&s;t condemnation of GOD. <HI>The Almighty &s;hall bring the wicked down into the pit of de&s;truction: bloody and deceitful men &s;hall not live out half their days.</HI> Vengeance cannot &s;leep&mdash;they are either de&s;troyed by the immediate act of GOD, to glorify his name&punc; and vindicate his ju&s;tice; or men are reduced to the horrid nece&s;&s;ity of cutting them off from the earth, for their own pre&s;ervation. When tho&s;e crimes are committed, which &s;trike at public life, the &s;acred law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation commands the guilty name to be era&s;ed from among the people.</P>
<P>THOUGH only a few crimes are made capital by the laws of the land, we &s;hould e&s;teem every &s;in tending to the &s;ame awful fate&mdash; vices through all their gradations are intimately connected&mdash; Such as knowingly indulge them&s;elves in &s;maller faults, have rea&s;on to fear the habit of iniquity will grow irre&s;i&s;tible&mdash;that GOD will permit them to do &s;ome great evil, which the ju&s;tice of men mu&s;t puni&s;h in the la&s;t and mo&s;t awful manner. How ma|ny, who have come to an untimely end by the hand of public ju&s;tice, in the la&s;t moments of their &s;hame, have lamented the beginnings of vice, and dated their de&s;truction from guilty prac|tices
<PB N="13" REF="015607_0011_0F99DBA92EFEDA70">
common among men&mdash;they began the fatal race no more wicked than their cotemporaries, but were permitted by GOD to indulge a &s;inful heart, and execute purpo&s;es which end in the mo&s;t public infamy and death. The pre&s;ent days bu&s;ine&s;s is a warning to all, to &s;uch particularly as indulge them&s;elves in known &s;in, to break off iniquity by repentance; le&s;t GOD AL|MIGHTY &s;hould determine in anger to withdraw his re&s;traint, and leave them to commit tho&s;e atrocious deeds which public ju&s;tice mu&s;t avenge.</P>
<P>SUFFER me in the <HI>third place,</HI> to &s;ay a few words on the impor|tance of being <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> guarded again&s;t &s;in.</P>
<P>WE have briefly viewed the horrid calamities tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors bring on them&s;elves by &s;inful indulgence&mdash;the lo&s;s of every de&s;ir|able ble&s;&s;ing, and many times of life it&s;elf. Will not he who is wi&s;e be guarded again&s;t temptation? As we regard our&s;elves; as we regard every thing that can be dear to a rational being, we &s;hould take every &s;tep with caution, and ru&s;h into no cour&s;e without previous examination whether or not it be forbidden.</P>
<P>TWO rea&s;ons require us to keep a con&s;tant guard&mdash;there are many tempters ready to throw in the fatal in&s;inuation, when dan|ger is lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected&mdash;and our own &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions are ea&s;ily enkindled.</P>
<P>FIRST. None are free from the influence of &s;educing &s;pirits, who watch with infernal art to catch the unguarded moment&mdash; the cho&s;en opportunity of de&s;troying. From tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t &s;atan will flee; but the incautious and &s;ecure he will follow with temptation, until their infamy and de&s;truction is &s;ealed. Added to the influence of evil &s;pirits, there is the de&s;igning policy of wicked men, who take plea&s;ure in propagating calamity and &s;e|ducing the unwarry into the paths of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>UNGODLY men, who mean to de&s;troy, frequently make their approaches with an appearance of much friend&s;hip, and <HI>betray us
<PB N="14" REF="015607_0012_0F99DBA9E9E80700">
to death with a ki&s;s,</HI> as Judas did the SON of GOD. On happen|ing into the company of tho&s;e, who profe&s;s veneration; but re|motely in&s;inuate again&s;t the good laws of GOD or men, we &s;hould immediately &s;et a double guard&mdash;dwell on the danger&mdash;and not give up a &s;ingle moment to carele&s;ne&s;s, for a moment may be fa|tal. <HI>Watch and pray le&s;t ye enter into temptation,</HI> is a mo&s;t excel|lent maxim for pre&s;ervation, and &s;ingularly nece&s;&s;ary in a day of public calamity, when the State is in &s;o critical a &s;ituation, that the di&s;hone&s;ty and bad example of a few per&s;ons may &s;hake its foundation.</P>
<P>THE depraved principles and pa&s;&s;ions of human nature, which are ea&s;ily excited, is a <HI>&s;econd rea&s;on</HI> why we &s;hould be con&s;tantly guarded again&s;t &s;in.</P>
<P>OUR pa&s;&s;ions, like the mo&s;t combu&s;tible matter, may in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly kindle at the touch of a &s;ingle &s;park&mdash;our appetites which are hu&s;hed into moderation one hour, may the next be fierce and victorious over rea&s;on, intere&s;t, duty, and every &s;a|cred obligation. Danger carried in our own brea&s;ts, is doubly great. There is no moment, in which a wi&s;e per&s;on who knows him&s;elf will &s;ay, I am &s;afe from falling by the corruption of my own nature.</P>
<P>"<HI>Say not,</HI> my brethren, <HI>when ye are tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. For every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lu&s;t, and enticed. When lu&s;t hath conceived, it bringeth forth &s;in: and &s;in when it is fini&s;hed, bringeth forth death.</HI>" O how awful the death! both of body and &s;pirit language loo&s;es its energy in de&s;cribing things &s;o awful. Glory to GOD! who is able to de|liver&mdash;Let us pray him to &s;ave us from the temptation of our own hearts&mdash;to give us chri&s;tian repentance, love and faith in his SON, that our &s;ins may be forgiven&mdash;that by the energy of his good &s;pirit he would enable us to purify our&s;elves, even as he is pure.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="015607_0013_0F99DBAB1F0CD270">I WILL conclude with &s;ome ob&s;ervations &s;ugge&s;ted by the oc|ca&s;ion of the day.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. IT learns us to love and revere our country, to obey its laws, to devote our&s;elves to its &s;ervice, and abhor every practice which hath any tendency to increa&s;e the public calamities.

Now he is covered with infamy, bound in chains, &s;urrounded with the in&s;truments of horror and <HI>death.</HI> From his fate let us learn the danger of encouraging a traterous di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;e|cretly attempting practices again&s;t our country; the mercy of men cannot pardon them, for darkne&s;s will not cover them, hell will not hide them. Our country, its privileges and laws are &s;acred&mdash;they guard our peace, our intere&s;t and lives&mdash;being e|nacted in a public manner, with the free con&s;ent of the people, they become <HI>ordinances of God</HI>; and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or offends a|gain&s;t <HI>Heaven and earth.</HI> Our liberties and free con&s;titution, are the patrimony which GOD ALMIGHTY hath given to every indi|vidual in the community; and is not that a cruel &s;inner who would defraud his brethren of Heaven's &s;acred and invaluable gift? and this may be done many ways&mdash;by open force and pri|vate artifice&mdash;not only by throwing off the ma&s;k and joining our enemies in the face of day; but by fomenting internal divi&s;ion; by in&s;inuations again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;tand foremo&s;t in the civil and military departments; by de&s;troying public credit; by imped|ing good government and the mea&s;ures of defence; by violating our own laws enacted for the mo&s;t &s;alutary purpo&s;es; by every kind of di&s;hone&s;ty, fraud and inju&s;tice, which di&s;&s;olves that har|mony which is the beauty and &s;trength of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IT is unhappy that &s;o many are in&s;en&s;ible of the veneration and punctual obedience due to the laws of the land. That people are not far from de&s;truction, who di&s;obey the public acts of their

own government&mdash;who endeavor artfully to elude the in&s;tituti|ons of their own legi&s;lature&mdash;who think them&s;elves better judges of &s;afety, and the means of pre&s;ervation than the collected wi&s;dom of the whole&mdash;who are generally become &s;o avaricious as to pre|fer the &s;malle&s;t intere&s;ts of their own, to the mo&s;t capital and &s;a|cred intere&s;ts of the State. A nation generally of this com|plexion, are the mo&s;t mi&s;erable on earth, are prepared for de&s;truc|tion and de&s;erve all its horrors&mdash;de&s;truction not only by a fo|reign enemy, but by them&s;elves, by the hands of their brethren. I ardently wi&s;h there were no appearance of this nature among us. It is known, and cannot be &s;ecreted; that many prefer a <HI>&s;ordid gain</HI> to the &s;alvation of their <HI>country, and would damn an em|pire to &s;hare a penny.</HI> I would not confine the charge of avarice to any particular character or cla&s;s of men; for &s;uch as till the field, and tho&s;e who barter the commodities of nations are equal|ly infected. Let &s;uch per&s;ons whatever their character may be in life; or however &s;acred or &s;afe they may e&s;teem them&s;elves, be warned by the proceedings of this day and do no more &s;o wickedly. Their principles are the &s;ame, and their practices al|mo&s;t as dangerous, as tho&s;e which condemned the unhappy per|&s;on who mu&s;t die this day. The particular way in which a wick|ed man betrays his country, is but a circum&s;tance; the de&s;ign of his heart, and the horrid effects of his practices, furni&s;h a true rule to determine his guilt. Is there not rea&s;on to think, that tho&s;e who knowingly injure the State by fraud, avarice and op|pre&s;&s;ion, would plunge their &s;words into its bowels, if they had courage to face danger? Tho&s;e people have rea&s;on to fear, that a righteous GOD provoked by their di&s;hone&s;ty, will leave them to be tempted, and commit tho&s;e political &s;ins which mu&s;t be pu|ni&s;hed by the halter and the gallows. My brethren, let us learn to love and venerate our country, to obey the laws, honor the con&s;titution, and de&s;pi&s;e all tho&s;e who are wickedly undermining the privileges of mankind.</P>

and families, &s;hould it be the will of GOD to call us thereto. We profe&s;s to be chri&s;tians; Can a chri&s;tian, can one who imi|tates the temper and manners of the SON of GOD, wi&s;h &s;ervitude and the horrors of &s;lavery to any creature on earth? Love to mankind, their happine&s;s and liberties, is e&s;&s;ential to the religion of JESUS. He died to purcha&s;e pre&s;ent and future liberty for men; and we cannot with any propriety call our&s;elves after his name, unle&s;s we are benevolent, love the peace and happine&s;s of others, and promote their good by all hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. THE melancholy &s;pectacle which is &s;oon to be exhibited, hath drawn together a va&s;t concour&s;e of people, who are doubt|le&s;s influenced by various motives to be &s;pectators of &s;o awful a &s;cene. Some by true &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and many to gratify a vain curio&s;ity. Curio&s;ity is but a poor motive for collecting on &s;uch an occa&s;ion&mdash;the per&s;on who can go and look on death, merely to gratify an idle humour, is de&s;titute both of humanity and piety.</P>
<P>SUCH awful exhibitions are de&s;igned that others may &s;ee and fear.&mdash;Go not to that place of horror with elevated &s;pirits, and gay hearts, for death is there! ju&s;tice and judgment are there! the power of government, di&s;played in its mo&s;t awful form, is there.</P>
<P>ONE rea&s;on why it is nece&s;&s;ary the unhappy per&s;on &s;hould thus die, is that others may be fortified again&s;t temptation by the &s;pectacle of horror, and the bitter con&s;equences of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. When you look thereon, learn the venerablene&s;s of the &s;tate and of civil government&mdash;the &s;acred nature of tho&s;e laws made to pro|tect liberty and property, and our obligations to obedience&mdash; learn that &s;in is puni&s;hed by infamy, di&s;tre&s;s and death&mdash;that the man who injures his country, and will not be re&s;trained by con|&s;iderations of duty, ju&s;tice and gratitude, mu&s;t be cut off from the earth that others may be &s;afe&mdash;remember that le&s;&s;er &s;ins, though they are not made capital by the laws of the State, lead directly towards the &s;ame untimely end.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="015607_0016_0F99DBADD59EB6B8">ABOVE all things, learn that we mu&s;t all die. Though we may hope to e&s;cape the &s;ame circum&s;tances and manner of death; the change in one form or another is certain. Realize the importance of being prepared to leave the world&mdash;how it feels to be within a few minutes of eternity! of the bar of GOD! of the &s;olemn &s;entence which determines a &s;tate of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery forever!</P>
<P>WITH regard to the dying criminal, while you acquie&s;ce in the nece&s;&s;ity of his fate, give him your prayers. Though pub|lic &s;afety forbids him pardon from the State, he may be pardoned by GOD ALMIGHTY. As chri&s;tians, forgive him&mdash;let not an idea that he hath &s;inned again&s;t the country, keep alive the pa&s;&s;ions of hatred and revenge.</P>
<P>REMEMBER the in&s;truction of CHRIST, <HI>forgive our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es as we forgive tho&s;e that tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us&mdash;forgive your enemies, and pray for tho&s;e who u&s;e you wickedly</HI>&mdash;commend his &s;pirit to the mer|cy of GOD, and the SAVIOUR of men's &s;ouls.</P>
<P>GOD grant, that the awful &s;cene may do us good&mdash;confirm us in holine&s;s and virtue, in the love of GOD and our country&mdash; that it may guard us again&s;t temptation, and make us careful to live in all good con&s;cience towards GOD and men&mdash;that we may finally lay down the&s;e tabernacles of fle&s;h in peace, tru&s;ting in the SAVIOUR's merits, and be received to the holy pre&s;ence of GOD.</P>
<P>TO HIM WHO RULES ALL THINGS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN PLEASURE AND WISDOM, WHO SAVES THE WORLD BY HIS BLOOD, AND SANCTIFIES THE UNGODLY, BE PRAISE, GLORY AND DOMINION FOREVER AND EVER, AMEN.</P>
