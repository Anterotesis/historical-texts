<P>A Dreadful Sound is in his Ears&mdash;.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AND if the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> be now repeated in <HI>our Ears,</HI> it is with &s;uch an Accent as this upon it, <HI>Hear this, and know it for thy Good.</HI> The <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> &s;hall not be made <HI>Audible</HI> unto us, upon any De&s;ign but this, That we may become tho&s;e whom it &s;hall <HI>not belong</HI> unto; That we may <HI>E&s;cape</HI> the Things contained in it, That we may be <HI>Saved with Fear,</HI> and be <HI>Per&s;waded</HI> into the Methods of our Salvation, <HI>Knowing the Terror of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>If it be Enquired, <HI>Who</HI> 'tis that has the <HI>Dreadful Sound in his Ears</HI>? The An&s;wer mu&s;t be fetched out of the preceeding Ver&s;e, 'Tis the <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> If you can &s;ay with <HI>Job,</HI> Lord, <HI>Thou knowe&s;t I am not wicked</HI>; Then, all the while you have the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in your <HI>Ears,</HI> it will be drowned with the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002251_0003_0FDADAD38E27B3F8">
of your Deliverance from all the&s;e Terrible Things. But the &s;ame <HI>Job</HI> &s;aid, <HI>If I be Wicked, Wo unto me</HI>! If any of you, <HI>my Neighbours,</HI> are con&s;cious of your coming under that Character, the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in your Ears, 'tis fit you &s;hould be made &s;en&s;ible of it, that &s;o <HI>being moved with fear,</HI> you may do tho&s;e things which will prepare you for a more <HI>Joyful Sound.</HI> The Be&s;t Thing that can be done for you is, That the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in your <HI>Ears,</HI> may awaken you into that cry, <HI>O wretched one that I am, who &s;hall deliver me!</HI></P>
<P>A Servant of GOD, here maintains this A&s;|&s;ertion; That <HI>perpetual Pain is the Portion of a Wicked Man.</HI> The Life of a Wicked Man is all &s;pent in continual <HI>Throws,</HI> to bring forth, nothing but that ugly Mon&s;ter <HI>Sin</HI>; which when it is <HI>Fini&s;hed brings forth Death.</HI> We La|ment the Condition of &s;ome who are <HI>&s;everal Days in Travail:</HI> But Oh! how Lamentable the Condition of a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> who <HI>Travaileth in pain all his Days</HI>! Yea, the <HI>Pain</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> is in this point, wor&s;e than the <HI>Pain of a Woman in Travail.</HI> For <HI>when &s;he is Delivered, &s;he remembreth her angui&s;h no more,</HI> for the <HI>Joy</HI> of what is <HI>Born into the World.</HI> But &s;o far is the <HI>Pain</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> from <HI>ending in Joy,</HI> that it hath no End at all. He <HI>Tra|vaileth in Pain all his Days.</HI></P>
<P>My Text is a Demon&s;tration and an Illu&s;|tration of what is thus a&s;&s;erted. A <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> or a Sound of Terrors, is in <HI>his Ears.</HI> And this is the awful DOCTRINE to be now in&s;i&s;ted on,
<Q><PB N="3" REF="002251_0004_0FDAC95F589E94F0">THERE are Things which make a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> does not always hear the <HI>Dreadful Sound.</HI> There is a <HI>deep &s;leep</HI> for the pre|&s;ent prevailing on a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> Though the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> be in his <HI>Ears,</HI> yet he &s;tops his <HI>Ears</HI> again&s;t it. But there will a Time come, when the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> will force its way into his <HI>Ears</HI>; he will be no longer able to &s;top his <HI>Ears.</HI> I was going to &s;ay, it &s;hall <HI>now</HI> do &s;o! It mu&s;t be the Work of them who ma|nage the <HI>Publick Exhortations,</HI> to make this <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> become as Articulate, as Intelligible, as Efficacious as may be, in the <HI>Ears</HI> of their Auditors. 'Tis our Commi&s;&s;ion to ut|ter the <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI>; We are to <HI>&s;ay</HI> that thing, and <HI>Cry aloud, and lift up our voice like a Trumpet</HI> in &s;aying of it, I&s;a. I<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">I.2. <HI>We to the wicked, it &s;hall be ill with him.</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this Commi&s;&s;ion, we will fir&s;t make this Enquiry,</P>
<P><HI>WHO is the <HI>Wicked Man?</HI></HI></P>
<P>And &s;urely, When it is asked, <HI>Who is the <HI>Wicked Man</HI></HI>? It mu&s;t needs be a <HI>Dreadful Sound,</HI> in the Ears of the Man to whom it &s;hall be with Conviction &s;aid, <HI>Thou art the Men.</HI> For this to be &s;poken from the Word of GOD unto any Man, <HI>Thou art a Wicked Man</HI>; verily There cannot be a more <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> heard among the Children of Men. I &s;hall proceed upon it; <HI>Who is the <HI>Wicked Man?</HI></HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002251_0005_0FDADAD859E19C40">It mu&s;t be an&s;wered, Fir&s;t, More Negatively. 'Tis not meerly to be a <HI>Sinner,</HI> that will con|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">e a <HI>Wicked Man. Eliphaz</HI> does not &s;ay or every Man who may fall into a Sin, A <HI>Dreadful Sound is in his Ears.</HI> For, <HI>There is not a Ju&s;t Man upon Earth, who doeth good and &s;in|neth not.</HI> It has been truly ob&s;erved, The <HI>Be&s;t of Saints</HI> while here on Earth are <HI>Sinners</HI>; but the <HI>wor&s;t of Saints</HI> are not <HI>Wicked.</HI> Indeed, There can be no Sin committed, but there i&s;|&s;ues from the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> unto the Sinner. No Man can <HI>Sin,</HI> but the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD will upon it &s;ay unto him; Ezek. XVIII.4. <HI>The Soul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die.</HI> But then, the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> quells the <HI>Dread|ful Sound</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> by leading us to that which <HI>&s;peaks better Things.</HI> And tho' the Be|liever of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> is not pre&s;ently barred from all Falls into <HI>Sin,</HI> yet the <HI>Guilt</HI> of the Sin into which he falls, is taken from him; and he is re&s;cued from that <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI>&punc; which deno|minates a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> When he falls into <HI>Sin,</HI> he falls into that which he <HI>Loves not.</HI> He may &s;ay with him; Rom. VII.15. It is <HI>what I allow not</HI>: It is <HI>what I hate.</HI> And &s;o he is not a <HI>Wicked Man: Bone vir, hoc nibil ad Te.</HI> The <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> is not for him.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Secondly; and more Po&s;itively. A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is a <HI>Sinner,</HI> who <HI>Loves</HI> to be a <HI>Sinner.</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> that is the <HI>Mark</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;hes a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> 'Tis that <HI>Wicked Love</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> which is incon|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="5" REF="002251_0006_0FDADAAA727B8DB0">
with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD, and with the di&s;po&s;itions of <HI>Piety,</HI> by which the true <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> is to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. This will be di&s;covered in &s;everal Properties of a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one under the <HI>Reigning Power</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> We read, Rom. IV.14. <HI>Sin &s;hall not have dominion over you, for ye are under Grace.</HI> If <HI>Sin</HI> have <HI>Dominion</HI> over a Man, he is not <HI>under Grace,</HI> or in good Terms with GOD; No, but he is a Subject of that <HI>Wicked Kingdom,</HI> in which every <HI>Subject</HI> is a <HI>Va&s;&s;al.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> has not the <HI>&s;teps</HI> of his Life, <HI>Or|dered by the Word of GOD</HI>: He leads a di&s;or|derly Life, becau&s;e <HI>Iniquity has Dominion over him.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one of tho&s;e who are called, <HI>The Servants of Sin,</HI> and <HI>The Servants of Corruption,</HI> and <HI>The Captives of the Devil.</HI> It may be &s;aid of him, <HI>He &s;erves divers Lu&s;ts.</HI> His Lu&s;ts have an ab&s;olute Command over him. The Motions of His <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> have an irre&s;i&s;tible Force upon him He can't Re&s;i&s;t his <HI>Criminal Propen&s;ities.</HI> He can't mortify his <HI>Carnal Ap|petites.</HI> His unmortified pa&s;&s;ions for <HI>Vile Things</HI> are too Potent for him. His <HI>Vices</HI> lay Chains upon him; draw him hither and hither to his Confu&s;ion. Tho' he knows it will confound him to Sin in &s;uch and &s;uch things, yet he <HI>mu&s;t needs go,</HI> when he feels him&s;elf driven into it. He is entirely governed by vicious Incli|nations.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Sin</HI> has the <HI>Full Con&s;ent</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> We read, Ho&s;. 5.11. <HI>He wil|lingly
<PB N="6" REF="002251_0007_0FDADADA46742538">
walked after the Commandment.</HI> That is to &s;ay, Commanded <HI>Idolatry.</HI> When <HI>Sin</HI> is pro|po&s;ed, and a Man <HI>goes willingly</HI> into the propo|&s;al, this <HI>Willingly</HI> is <HI>Wickedly.</HI> Indeed, there is no <HI>Sin</HI> without &s;ome degree of <HI>Con&s;ent.</HI> There goes a <HI>Con&s;ent of the Will</HI> unto ever, <HI>Act of Sin.</HI> But then there is a difference between the <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> which a <HI>Godly Man</HI> yields unto Sin, and the <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> given by a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> When a <HI>Godly Man</HI> Sins, his Fault rather lies in this, that he does not <HI>Deny,</HI> than that he does <HI>Con|&s;ent.</HI> As when a thing is put unto the <HI>Vote,</HI> a Man who does not <HI>oppo&s;e,</HI> but only <HI>&s;u&s;pend</HI> his <HI>Vote,</HI> in &s;ome &s;ort, yields his <HI>Con&s;ent.</HI> As our <HI>Caryl</HI> expre&s;&s;es it;
<Q>A Child of GOD, when a Temptation comes, he does not give a direct, <HI>Yea,</HI> of <HI>Con&s;ent</HI>; but when he Sins, he does not give his, <HI>No,</HI> &s;o livelily as he ought to do.</Q>
His <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> unto <HI>Sin</HI> is a kind of a <HI>middle Act</HI>; it lies in his <HI>not Refu&s;ing</HI> to Sin, his not Refu&s;ing, Rejecting, Repelling the of|fer with &s;uch <HI>Vigour</HI> as he ought to do. But now, a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> Sins with a <HI>Full Con&s;ent</HI>: He is one who <HI>Chu&s;es to Sin</HI>: Yea, He is one who <HI>prefers</HI> a <HI>way of &s;in.</HI> The <HI>Will</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> fully clo&s;es with Sin. He has his <HI>Will</HI> when he does a &s;inful Thing. If his <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> remon&s;trate unto the Folly of what he is going to do, yet his <HI>Affection</HI> thoroughly e&s;pou&s;es it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> does <HI>Re&s;olve</HI> to <HI>Sin.</HI> We read, Eccl. VIII.11. <HI>The heart of the &s;ons of men is fully &s;et in them to do evil.</HI> There
<PB N="7" REF="002251_0008_0FDADAABEAB62888">
are tho&s;e who have an <HI>Heart fully &s;et,</HI> upon &s;inning; &s;uch <HI>Sons of Men</HI> are the <HI>Children of Wickedne&s;s.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> if he make <HI>Prayers</HI> again&s;t Sin, yet he brings not <HI>hearty De&s;ires</HI> again&s;t Sin. A <HI>Re&s;olved Sinner</HI> is a <HI>Wicked Man.</HI> His <HI>Re&s;olutions</HI> are, <HI>To morrow &s;hall be as this day, and much more abundantly.</HI> A Godly Man is one who <HI>Cleaves</HI> to GOD with a <HI>Full Pur|po&s;e of Heart.</HI> The <HI>main purpo&s;e</HI> of his Heart is for <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> in all the Exerci&s;es of it. When he <HI>Sins</HI> 'tis be&s;ide his <HI>purpo&s;e</HI>; his <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> was to have done otherwi&s;e. He is out of his way when he <HI>does ami&s;s</HI>: The well meaning Traveller has <HI>mi&s;&s;ed his way.</HI> As it has been Remarked, <HI>Peter</HI> denied the Lord, it was not becau&s;e he <HI>Re&s;olved</HI> &s;o to do; but rather becau&s;e he <HI>Re&s;olved</HI> &s;o much in his own &s;trength to do otherwi&s;e. A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one who <HI>Re&s;ol|vedly</HI> &s;ets him&s;elf in a <HI>way that is not Good.</HI> He can <HI>Sin</HI> on <HI>Deliberation,</HI> and he does it with <HI>Re&s;olution.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, 'Tis the <HI>Delight</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> to <HI>Sin.</HI> We read, Prov. X.23. <HI>It is a &s;port unto a fool to do mi&s;chief.</HI> When Men can <HI>&s;port</HI> them&s;elves in <HI>Sin,</HI> then mi&s;chievous is their <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI>; 'tis <HI>mi&s;chievous Madne&s;s.</HI> To a <HI>Virtuous Man, Sin</HI> is the <HI>greate&s;t &s;orrow:</HI> To a <HI>Wicked Man, Sin</HI> is the <HI>greate&s;t plea&s;ure.</HI> The Man who <HI>plea&s;es</HI> GOD, is one who <HI>takes plea|&s;ure</HI> in doing &s;o. He <HI>Chu&s;es the things that plea&s;e</HI> GOD. The <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one who <HI>plea&s;es him&s;elf</HI> rather than GOD, and never more than in <HI>&s;inning</HI> again&s;t GOD. We have been told,
<PB N="8" REF="002251_0009_0FDADADE4CC97BB8">
That there are &s;uch Things as, <HI>The plea&s;ures of &s;in.</HI> 'Tis the gui&s;e of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> to count them &s;o. A <HI>Wi&s;er Man</HI> counts them Torments, Horrors, <HI>bitter</HI> Mi&s;eries. The Rule is, <HI>Delight thy &s;elf in the Lord, and he &s;hall give thee the de&s;ires of thy heart.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one who does <HI>Delight in &s;inning again&s;t the Lord.</HI> There|in he has the <HI>De&s;ires of his Heart.</HI> It is a <HI>Grief</HI> unto a <HI>Good Man</HI> to <HI>Sin.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is <HI>glad</HI> when he <HI>Sins; Glad</HI> when GOD is <HI>griev'd.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Cu&s;tom in Sin</HI> is the con&s;ummation of <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI>; the fini&s;hing &s;troke in a <HI>Wick|ed Man.</HI> He is, as I may now agreeably ex|pre&s;s it, an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> in Wickedne&s;s. We read of &s;ome, Jer. XIII.23. <HI>Who are accu&s;tomed to do evil</HI>; and can leave it off no more than the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> can <HI>Change his skin.</HI> They that are <HI>Ac|cu&s;tomed to do evil</HI> are <HI>Wicked Men.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one who <HI>makes a Trade of Sin.</HI> A <HI>Gracious Man</HI> may <HI>Sin</HI> and may <HI>Repeat</HI> the Sin. But then, he breaks off the <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> with begging &amp; pleading for help again&s;t the Sin. He makes many a <HI>com|plaint</HI> again&s;t the Sin. He never gives over <HI>com|plaining,</HI> till he has got the <HI>Victory.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is <HI>Cu&s;tomarily</HI> &s;o: He is one who is <HI>com|monly</HI> overtaken with &s;uch Things as he knows to be <HI>Abominable Things, hated by the Soul of GOD.</HI> It is the <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> the <HI>Cour&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Way</HI> of a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> to do tho&s;e Things, which he knows are Forbidden by GOD, and Offen&s;ive to Him. Tho' he knows that he <HI>Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es</HI> in what he does, yet a <HI>Wicked Man</HI> will <HI>go on
<PB N="9" REF="002251_0010_0FDADAAE05E05948">
&s;till in his Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es</HI>; and make a <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> of do|ing the Things which he does <HI>not think to be Right.</HI> When the&s;e <HI>Five Brands</HI> are &s;et upon a Sinner he may be turned loo&s;e into the <HI>Com|mon,</HI> to graze among <HI>Wicked Men.</HI> This is a <HI>Lover of Sin,</HI> and mu&s;t <HI>go in the company of wicked Men</HI>; which is al&s;o what he <HI>Loves</HI> to do: 'Tis the Note of &s;uch an one, That he <HI>Loves</HI> to do &s;o; <HI>Loves</HI> to Flock with the <HI>Birds</HI> of his <HI>Feather,</HI> though never &s;uch <HI>unclean</HI> and <HI>hateful</HI> ones. This, This is the Man, that mu&s;t have in his Ears, a <HI>Dreadful Sound.</HI> This before we go any further mu&s;t be &s;poken to him, than which there cannot be a more <HI>Dreadful Sound; <HI>Thou art a Wicked Man;</HI> And the Portion of the Wicked belongs unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>But we are now come to our &s;econd Inquiry,</P>
<P><HI>WHAT are the Things which make a <HI>Dread|ful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a</HI> Wicked Man?</P>
<P>In general, There is this <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a <HI>Wicked Man</HI>; Man, <HI>Except what thou heare&s;t in the Tenders of the Go&s;pel, there is nothing that makes a Joyful Sound unto thee.</HI> A <HI>Wicked Man</HI> is one under the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> of GOD. Now, as it was of old &s;aid, <HI>How &s;hall I cur&s;e, whom God hath not cur&s;ed?</HI> So it may be &s;aid, <HI>How can they be ble&s;&s;ed, whom God hath cur&s;ed?</HI> None can &s;peak a Comfortable thing unto the <HI>Cur&s;ed</HI> of GOD. There is this <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Ears of the <HI>Wicked.</HI> I&s;a. LVII.21.
<PB N="10" REF="002251_0011_0FDADAE1601E03F0">
<HI>There is no peace, &s;aith my God, unto the wicked.</HI> Every Thing is a <HI>Micajah</HI> to a <HI>Wicked Man</HI>; it <HI>Prophecies</HI> nothing but <HI>Evil</HI> unto him. All the <HI>Objects</HI> which &s;urround a <HI>Wicked Man,</HI> &s;ay this unto him, I <HI>am &s;ent with heavy Tidings unto thee.</HI> All the <HI>Creatures</HI> are up in Arms again&s;t them, who per&s;i&s;t in Rebellion again&s;t the Glo|rious GOD. <HI>Hear ye Rebels</HI>; were ye not very deaf, you might hear this <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> from all the <HI>Creatures</HI> unto GOD crying a|gain&s;t you, <HI>Shall we &s;mite them, O GOD, &s;hall we &s;mite them</HI>! Yea, The <HI>whole Creation</HI> is <HI>groaning</HI> again&s;t you for the Abu&s;es you put upon it. There is a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the <HI>Groans</HI> of the <HI>whole Creation,</HI> to be <HI>delivered</HI> from your Abu&s;es.</P>
<P>But more particularly,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Threatnings</HI> which are denounced in the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD again&s;t every <HI>Wicked Man:</HI> Certainly, the&s;e mu&s;t needs make a <HI>Dread|ful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a Wicked Man. When the <HI>Commandments</HI> of GOD were given from the Flaming Mountain, there was a <HI>Dread|ful Sound</HI> in the Ears of the People. We read, Exod. XIX.16. <HI>There were Thundrings and Lightnings, and the voice of a Trumpet ex|ceeding loud, &s;o that all the people that were in the camp trembled.</HI> The <HI>Commandments</HI> of GOD are armed with Tremendous <HI>Threatnings</HI> again&s;t the Breaches of it. The <HI>Law</HI> has its <HI>Penalties</HI> for the Breakers of it The <HI>Threatnings</HI> in the
<PB N="11" REF="002251_0012_0FDADAB30DBE4F80">
Word of GOD, again&s;t the <HI>Wickedne&s;s,</HI> wherein the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD is violated, what are they but <HI>Thundrings</HI> and <HI>Lightnings</HI>; and the <HI>Voice of a Trumpet exceeding Loud,</HI> making a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> in the Ears of a <HI>Wicked man.</HI> O mo&s;t Hard hearted one, why do&s;t thou <HI>Tremble</HI> &s;o lit|tle under the Fulminations? We read, Rom. I.18. <HI>The wrath of GOD is revealed from Heaven, again&s;t all Ungodline&s;s &amp; Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men.</HI> 'Tis Re|vealed &amp; Proclaimed, &amp; Publi&s;hed in the <HI>Threat|nings</HI> of His <HI>Word.</HI> But, What a <HI>Dreadful Sound</HI> is made by the&s;e <HI>Threatnings</HI> in the Ears of all <HI>Ungodly</HI> and <HI>Unrighteous</HI> men?
