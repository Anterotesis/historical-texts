<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN the ambition of Princes induces them to break over the &s;acred barriers of &s;ocial compact, and to violate tho&s;e rights, which it is their duty to defend, they will leave no methods une&s;&s;ayed to bring the people to acquie&s;ce in their unju&s;tifiable encroachments.</P>
<P>IN this cau&s;e, the pens of venal authors have, in every age, been drawn&punc; With Machiavelian &s;ubtilty, they have laboured to per&s;wade mankind, that their public happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in being &s;ubject to uncontrouled power; that they were incapable of judging concerning the my&s;teries of government; and that it was their intere&s;t to deliver their e&s;tates, their liberties, and their lives, into the hands of an ab&s;olute Monarch.</P>
<P>MITER<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> hypocrites, and cringing, ba&s;e-&s;ouled Prie&s;ts, have impiou&s;ly dared to inli&s;t the oracles of GOD into the &s;ervice of de&s;poti&s;m; to a&s;&s;ert, that, by the command of the &s;upreme lawgiver, we are bound to &s;urrender our rights into the hands of the fir&s;t bold Tyrant, who dares to &s;eize them; and that when &s;o &s;eized, it is rebellion again&s;t God, and trea&s;on again&s;t the Prince, for us to attempt to re&s;ume them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015101_0005_0F95D2D82E68A938">DEPRAVED as is the human under&s;tanding, it hath yet &s;trength enough to di&s;cern the ridiculous falacy of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions: The votaries of ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition may indeed be impo&s;ed upon by them: When we place un|limited confidence in our civil or &s;piritual fathers, we can &s;wallow, with ea&s;e&punc; the mo&s;t improbable dogmas; but there are feelings in the human heart, which compel men to recognize their own rights, to venerate the maje&s;ty of the people, and to de&s;pi&s;e the in&s;ult which is offered to their under&s;tandings, by the&s;e doating ab&s;urdities. Had princes no other methods to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;es, could they not e&s;tabli&s;h their u&s;arpation, without convincing mens judgments of their utility, they would be more harmle&s;s to mankind than they have ever yet been? They might be &s;urrounded with the fa&s;cinating gew-gaws of regal pomp; a few para&s;ites might bow the knee before the&s;e idols of their own creating; the weak and the wicked might obey their mandates; but the baneful influence which they now have upon the intere&s;ts of individuals, and of &s;ociety, would come to a period: they would not revel in the &s;poils of nations, nor trample upon the ruins of public Liberty.</P>
<P>CONSCIOUS of this, they have u&s;ed arguments, and pur&s;ued methods, en|tirely different from the&s;e, to effect their de&s;igns; in&s;tead of convincing the under&s;tandings, they have addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the pa&s;&s;ions of men: The acts of bribery and corruption have been tried with a fatal &s;ucce&s;s: Men, <HI>We</HI> know, have &s;old their children, their country, and their GOD, for a &s;mall quantity of painted dirt, <HI>which will peri&s;h with the u&s;ing</HI>&punc;</P>
<P>EXTENSIVE as are the revenues of princes, they are &s;till inadequate to the purpo&s;e of bribing large communities to &s;ubmit to their plea&s;ure; cor|rupting therefore a few, they have overawed the re&s;t; from &s;mall beginnings, and under &s;pacious pretences, they will u&s;e a &s;tanding military force, the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfull engine ever yet weilded by the hand of lawle&s;s domination.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="015101_0006_0F95D2D8EEEC40B8">WITH &s;uch a force, it is ea&s;y for an ambitious prince, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by nature of very &s;lender abilities, to &s;ubvert every principle of liberty in the con&s;titu|tion of his government, and to render his people the mo&s;t abject of &s;laves; if any individual feels the injury done to his country, and wi&s;hes to re&s;tore it to a &s;tate of happine&s;s, with a bayonet at his brea&s;t, a dragoon will compel him to &s;ilence: If the people, awakened to &s;ee their intere&s;t and their duty, a&s;&s;em|ble for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, a military force is at hand to &s;ubdue them, and by leaden arguments, to convince them of their error.</P>
<P>AN ea&s;y ta&s;k would it be to enlarge upon the fatal con&s;equences of keep|ing up &s;uch a &s;tanding army in time of peace, and of quartering a lawle&s;s body of men, who de&s;pi&s;e the ju&s;t re&s;traints of civil authority, in free and populous cities: That no ve&s;tige of freedom can remain in a &s;tate where &s;uch a force exi&s;ts; that the morals of the people will be gradually corrupted; that they will contract &s;uch an habit of tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as to become an ea&s;y prey to the brutal tyrant who rules them; hath been heretofore largely and plainly demon&s;trated, by per&s;ons &s;o much more capable of doing it, than he who is &s;peaking, that it would be pre&s;umption in him to attempt it now.</P>
<P>THERE is no need of recurring to the ancient hi&s;tories of Greece and Rome, for in&s;tances of the&s;e truths. The Briti&s;h nation, once famous for its attachment to freedom, and enthu&s;ia&s;tically jealous of its rights, is now become a great tame bea&s;t, which fetches and carries for any mini&s;ter who plea&s;es to employ it.</P>
<P>ENGLISHMEN have been wont to boa&s;t of the excellence of their con|&s;titution; to boa&s;t that it contained whatever was excellent, in every form of
<PB N="8" REF="015101_0007_0F95D2D9AC01F208">
government, hitherto, by the wit of man devi&s;ed; in their King, who&s;e power was limited, they have a&s;&s;erted that they enjoyed the advantages of Monarchy, without fear of its evils: While their hou&s;e of Commons, cho&s;en by the &s;uffrages of the people, and dependant upon them, repre&s;ented a re|public; their hou&s;e of peers, forming a balance of power between the king and the people, gave them the benefit of an ari&s;tocracy. In theory, the Briti&s;h con&s;titution is, on many accounts, excellent; but when we ob&s;erve it re|duced to practice, when we ob&s;erve the Briti&s;h government, as it has been, for a long cour&s;e of years, admini&s;tered, we mu&s;t be convinced that its boa&s;ted advantages are not real: The management of the public revenue, the appoint|ment of civil and military officers, are ve&s;ted in the king: Improving the advantages which tho&s;e powers give him, he hath &s;ound means to corrupt the other branches of the legi&s;lature: Britons plea&s;e them&s;elves with the thought of being free; their tyrant &s;uffers them to enjoy the &s;hadow, whil&s;t he him&s;elf gra&s;ps the &s;ub&s;tance of power. Impo&s;&s;ible would it have been for the kings of England to have acquired &s;uch an exorbitant power, had they not had a &s;tanding army under their command: With the officers of this army they have bribed men to &s;acrifice the rights of their country: Having artfully got their arms out of the hands of the people, with their mercenary forces, they have awed them into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. When they have appeared, at any time, di&s;|po&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert their freedom, the&s;e troops have been ready to obey the man|dates of their &s;overeign, to imbrue their hands in the blood of their brethren.</P>
<P>HAVING found the efficacy of this method to quell a &s;pirit of liberty in the people of Great-Britain, the <HI>righteous</HI> admini&s;tration of the <HI>righteous</HI> king, George the third, determined to try the experiment upon the people of Ame|rica. To fright us into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their unju&s;tifiable claims, they &s;ent a mili|tary force to the town of Bo&s;ton. This day leads us to reflect upon the fatal effects of the mea&s;ure! By their intercour&s;e with troops, made up in general
<PB N="9" REF="015101_0008_0F95D2DA6C8D8C50">
of the mo&s;t abandoned of men, the morals of our youth were corrupted: The temples and the day of our God were &s;candalou&s;ly prophaned: We experien|ced the mo&s;t provoking in&s;ults; and at length &s;aw the &s;treets of Bo&s;ton &s;trewed with the corp&s;es of five of its inhabitants, murdered in cool blood, by the Briti&s;h mercenaries.</P>
<P>THE indignant rage which &s;welled your bo&s;oms upon this occa&s;ion, the forti|tude and humanity which you di&s;covered, the angui&s;h of the friends and rela|tives of the dead and wounded, with all the horrors of that memorable night, have been painted in vivid colours by an HANCOCK and a WARREN&punc; They have &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e exertions made by the town, which de|feated at that time, the de&s;igns of the enemies to American liberty, and pre&s;er|ved us, for the pre&s;ent, from the calamities of war.</P>
<P>BUT the pa&s;t year hath pre&s;ented us with a Tragedy more &s;triking, becau&s;e more exten&s;ive, than this: A Tragedy, which more plainly proves the fatal effects of keeping up &s;tanding armies in time of peace, than any arguments what&s;oever: We have &s;een the ground crim&s;oned with the gore of hundreds of our fellow-citizens,&mdash;we have &s;een the fir&s;t city in America for wealth and extent, depopulated, we have &s;een others de&s;troyed, and heard our &s;avage ene|mies breathing out thir&s;tings for our blood.</P>
<P>FINDING their arts in&s;ufficient to flatter, or their trea&s;ures to bribe the people of America, out of their freedom, the Briti&s;h government determined, by force, to &s;ubjugate them to their arbitrary will: In con&s;equence of this determi|nation, a large party of their troops marched from Bo&s;ton, on the morning of the ever memorable nineteenth of April la&s;t, flu&s;hed with the hopes of certain victory,
<PB N="10" REF="015101_0009_0F95D2DB2C85A0F8">
and defying the armies of the living God, they broke through every divine and political obligation; they wantoned in cruelty; they &s;hed again American blood.</P>
<P>AROUSED by the unprovoked injury, like a lion, awaking from his &s;lum|ber, we &s;prang to arms! we felt our&s;elves in&s;pired with the &s;pirit of our ance&s;|tors, we heard our brethrens blood crying to us for vengeance, we ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of battle: we compelled our enemies to betake them&s;elves to a di&s;|graceful flight, we pur&s;ued them with avidity, and de&s;i&s;ted not till they took re|fuge in that city, of which, by fraud and treachery, they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>TRUSTING to the divine protection, from that hour we determined never to &s;heathe the &s;word, till we had reparation for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> injuries, till we had &s;ecured our own freedom and the freedom of our po&s;terity&punc; From that hour the den of our enemies hath been &s;urrounded by an American army, <HI>brave and determined</HI> although they had before boa&s;ted of their &s;uperiority to all the troops in the world, they have &s;carcely dared to &s;et their feet out of their &s;trong holds &s;ince that time; and in&s;tead of ravaging the American Continent in a &s;ingle campaign, with a &s;ingle regiment, they have proceeded &mdash;<HI>one mile and an half</HI> in the conque&s;t of it.</P>
<P>THE heights of Charle&s;town witne&s;&s;ed to the world, that Americans, fight+ing in the cau&s;e of freedom, were a formidable foe: although they were &s;ur|rounded by troops, hitherto deemed invincible; although they &s;aw the habita|tions of their countrymen inveloped with flames; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ough the cannon roared on every quarter, and they beheld &s;cenes of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> blood&s;hed, to which they were entirely unu&s;ed, yet they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> had compelled their

enemy twice to retreat, and had expended the whole of their ammunition: The Briti&s;h forces gained the ground, but they lo&s;t the flower of their army.</P>
<P>FROM one end of the continent to the other, a &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;&s;es hath at|tended the American arms, in&s;tead of having troops of &s;avages poured down to our frontiers, (which the murderous policy of the tyrant of Britain induced him to attempt) we have, through the favour of Heaven, carried our victorious arms into the very bowels of Canada; in&s;tead of having our &s;tores and provi|&s;ions cut off by the enemy, we have made important captures from them: Suc|ce&s;s hath crowned our enterprizes, while di&s;appointment hath followed tho&s;e who oppo&s;e us.</P>
<P>THAT elation of &s;pirit, which is excited by our victories, is damped by our feeling the calamities of war. To hear the expiring groans of our beloved coun|trymen; to behold the flames of our habitations, once the abodes of peace and plenty, a&s;cending to Heaven, to &s;ee ruin and de&s;olation &s;pread over our fruitful villages, mu&s;t occa&s;ion &s;en&s;ations in the highe&s;t degree painful.</P>
<P>THIS Day, upon which the gloomy &s;cene was fir&s;t opened, calls upon us to mourn for the Heroes who have already died in the bed of honour, fighting for GOD and their country <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> does it lead us to recollect the name and the virtues of General <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the kind, the humane, the benevolent friend, in the private <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> inflexible patriot, the undaunted com|mander in his public <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> recollected with gratitude and e&s;teem!

<P>WHEN we traver&s;e the Canadian wilds, and come to the plains of Abra|ham, where WOLFE once fell, we are there again compelled to pay a tribute to exalted merit, and to lament the fall of the great MONTGOMERY! War|med with a &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, too little felt by his venal countrymen, he e&s;pou|&s;ed the cau&s;e of American freedom: He left dome&s;tic ea&s;e and affluence: He girded on the &s;word which he had long laid a&s;ide, and <HI>jeoparded his life on the high places of the field:</HI> Victory followed his &s;tandard, &s;he hover'd o'er his head, and crowned it with the laurel wreath: She was ju&s;t ready to hail him the Con|queror of <HI>Canada,</HI> when the fatal &s;i&s;ters &s;napped, in a moment the thread of life, and &s;eized, from his eager gra&s;p, the unta&s;ted conque&s;t!

<P>THAT a &s;pirit of public virtue may tran&s;cend every private con&s;idera|tion, you, the re&s;pected inhabitants of the Town of Bo&s;ton, have plainly manife&s;ted: With plea&s;ure you have &s;acrificed what &s;elfi&s;h men hold mo&s;t dear, to &s;ave this oppre&s;&s;ed land! With firmne&s;s you have re&s;i&s;ted every attack of arbitrary power! Like the &s;turdy oak, you have &s;tood unmoved, and to you, under God, will be owing the &s;alvation of this exten&s;ive con|tinent.</P>
<P>WE feel, my beloved friends, our obligations to you! Our hearts con|fe&s;s them; we cordially wi&s;h it were in our power to reward you for your patrioti&s;m; to re&s;tore you to that ea&s;e and affluence, of which, for our &s;akes, you have deprived your&s;elves; it is not, But our morning and evening petitions to the guardian God of America &s;hall be, that he will ble&s;s and reward you.</P>
<P>WITH tran&s;port, my countrymen, let us look forward to the bright day, which &s;hall hail us a free and independant &s;tate. With earne&s;tne&s;s let us implore the forgivene&s;s and the patronage of the Being of all beings, who holds the fate of empires in his hands! With zeal let us exert our|&s;elves in the &s;ervice of our country, in life: And when the earthly &s;cene &s;hall be clo&s;ing with us, let us expire with this prayer upon our quiver|ing lips, O GOD, LET AMERICA BE FREE!</P>
