Our Lord Jesus Christ is <HI>Man;</HI> and the <HI>Kindred</HI> which by His Incarnation He comes to have unto us, does marvellous|ly make way for our <HI>Union</HI> unto Him.

<P>First, We must not propound unto our selves an <HI>Union so Remote,</HI> as what shall be <HI>Mental</HI> only.

<P>Nor may we, Secondly, propound unto our selves an <HI>Union so Confus'd;</HI> as what shall arise to be <HI>Personal:</HI> The <HI>Familist</HI> has counted himself so <HI>united</HI> unto our Lord, as to be, C<HI>hristed with Christ;</HI> but our <HI>Union</HI> will afford no room for such Nonsensical and Blasphe|mous <HI>Gibberish.</HI> Our whole <HI>Persons</HI> are to have an <HI>Union</HI> with the whole <HI>Per|son</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ; and yet our <HI>Union</HI> will not make our persons to become <HI>One Person</HI> with Him.</P>

The Answer is,</P>
<P>First, We are to be <HI>United in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Profession.</HI> And this must be a true <HI>Pro|fession</HI> too; or else our <HI>Union</HI> is but <HI>Faction,</HI> and no better than that of <HI>Jew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or <HI>Turks.</HI> What says the Apostle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 1 Cor. 1. 10. <HI>I beseech you Brethren, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Name of our Lord Jesus</HI> C<HI>hrist, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ye all speak the same Thing, and that there be no Divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together, in the same Mind, and in the same Judgment.</HI> As fat as we can, we should be of the same O|pinion, and hold the same <HI>Doctrine</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Christianity; be sure we must concu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in all the <HI>Fundamental</HI> Ones, or els<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> we cut off our selves from the, <HI>Com|munion of Saints;</HI> and as he that had the <HI>Plague in his head,</HI> we are shut out from the Camp and Church of God.
