<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>PSALM XXV.11.</BIBL>
<P>For thy names Sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity: for it is great.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS P&s;alm was pen'd by <HI>David,</HI> in a time of great Affliction. And it ap|pears mo&s;t likely, from &s;everal Pa&s;&s;a|ges in it, that he wrote it in his Old Age, after his &s;hameful fall into Murder and Adultery; and in the time of the great Rebellion, which was rai&s;ed again&s;t him, by his ungrateful Son <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> who wou'd have u&s;urp'd the Crown and Kingdom from him. And as Sin is the only ground of God's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and the moral cau&s;e of all the Afflictions we meet with; &s;o we find <HI>David</HI> here (as in all the other P&s;alms which were pen'd on the like &s;orrowful Occa&s;ions) makings mourn|ful confe&s;&s;ion of his Sins, and &s;eeking the Favour and Protection of God, by fir&s;t, &s;ecuring a Pardon to him&s;elf And indeed this is the only effectual Cour&s;e we can take, to obtain mercy from God, in any time of Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003851_0003_100264CFAD825078">And as I am now call'd, by the Providence of God, to preach the la&s;t Sermon to two Condemn|ed <HI>Criminals,</HI> who in a few hours, are to have the fatal Sentence executed upon them, I know of no Subject more proper than this, to quicken &amp; direct them in their &s;peedy Preparations for that awful Eternity they are going into. And therefore, poor mi&s;erable Men, I be&s;eech you, by the Mercies of God, to give the mo&s;t &s;erious and clo&s;e Attention to the&s;e publick Coun&s;els which are the la&s;t you are ever like to receive, in this way, before you ap|pear at the awful Bar of God; where, 'tis likely, before this Day is ended, you will receive that Divine Sentence, which will determine your eter|nal State, and fix you either in everla&s;ting Hap|pine&s;s, or in endle&s;s Mi&s;ery. Indeed the little Ac|quaintance I have had with you &s;ince your Impri|&s;onment and Condemnation (by rea&s;on of my bo|dily Indi&s;po&s;itions, and other nece&s;&s;ary Avocations) very much unfit me for making tho&s;e particular Applications to you, which, I fear, your unhappy State and Circum&s;tances may call for.

But &s;ince he has declined the Service, that he might have greater lei&s;ure to ex|pre&s;s his tender Compa&s;&s;ions for you in tho&s;e more private and per&s;onal Applications, which you have all along &s;tood in the greate&s;t need of; and &s;ince the Lot is now fallen upon me, I &s;hall endeavour, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven, to give you the mo&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="003851_0004_100264D131411D98">
&s;ea&s;onable Advice I can from the&s;e words of the P&s;almi&s;t; which contain a mo&s;t moving and ardent Addre&s;s to God: An Addre&s;s fit for any Sinner in a dying Hour, and e&s;pecially for &s;uch notorious Malefactors as you have been. And that you may be enabled by divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to make this Prayer to God in your la&s;t Moments, with that Under&s;tanding, Faith and Fervency, which will &s;ecure your eternal Salvation; I &s;hall, fir&s;t, briefly explain the&s;e Words, and then &s;peak to &s;ome Doctrinal Notes from them.</P>
<P>And for the Explanation of them, we may ob|&s;erve the following things.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have here <HI>David</HI>'s Petition for pardoning Grace, in the&s;e words, <HI>Pardon mine Iniquity.</HI> To pardon iniquity, is to do away the Guilt of Sin; or to free a Sinner from that &s;entence of Condem|nation which he has ju&s;tly fallen under, by his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law of God. And this is the Subject of <HI>David</HI>'s Reque&s;t here. <HI>Pardon mine Iniquity:</HI> mine Iniquity, in the &s;ingular Num|ber. From whence 'tis very likely the P&s;almi&s;t had an immediate reference to &s;ome particular hei|nous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, he had been guilty of, and for which he was then full of Di&s;tre&s;s, both in Body and Mind. And if he had an Eye here to his <HI>Mur|der</HI> and <HI>Adultery</HI> (as I ob&s;erved before) the&s;e, in|deed, were Sins of a complicated guilt: and we have no rea&s;on to wonder at the Angui&s;h of Soul he expre&s;&s;es on the account of them. But how|ever we need not confine the &s;en&s;e of the words &s;o as to exclude his other Sins: For when a true Penitent pleads for the Pardon of any particular great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, he has been left to fall into, in a day of Temptation, he earne&s;tly de&s;ires the pardon of all his Sins, at the &s;ame time. And that this was the ca&s;e with <HI>David,</HI> when he pen'd this
<PB N="4" REF="003851_0005_100204A35D15E088">
P&s;alm, appears from the 18<HI>th ver&s;e</HI> of the Context, <HI>Forgive all my Sins.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We may ob&s;erve, of <HI>Whom</HI> it is, <HI>David</HI> asks the Pardon of his Iniquities. And this is of God alone: <HI>O Lord, pardon &amp;c.</HI> For as God is mo&s;t highly offended by Sin, and as he is the only Ob|ject of Prayer; &s;o 'tis He only can effectually for|give our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: and agreably we read in P&s;al. 130.4&punc; 7. <HI>With the Lord there is forgivene&s;s, and with him there is plenteous Redemption, that he may be feared.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We may further ob&s;erve, the <HI>Arguments, David</HI> made u&s;e of for the &s;ucce&s;s of his Prayer. And the&s;e are two: The one taken from the final Cau&s;e, and the other from the Object. The fir&s;t is taken from the <HI>final</HI> Cau&s;e; in the&s;e Words, <HI>For thy Names &s;ake,</HI> i e. That the Greatne&s;s of thy free and &s;overeign Grace and Mercy, may be di&s;played and magnified in pardoning mine Iniquities. This is a very natural Plea in it &s;elf, and one of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Pleas we can make for the obtain|ing a Pardon For Mercy is <HI>emphatically</HI> the Name of God: and the Di&s;play of it, in a way con&s;i&s;tent with Divine Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s, is the la&s;t and highe&s;t End of Forgivene&s;s For God forgives a Sinner, <HI>not for his own worthine&s;s, but for his great Mercies Sake in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Again, the other Argument here, is taken from Sin, the <HI>Object</HI> of pardoning Mercy: In the&s;e words, <HI>for it is great.</HI> That is, the Iniquity of which I beg a Pardon, is great. It is attended with very great Aggravati|ons: I have greatly di&s;honoured thy Name by it: It has contracted an exceeding great Guilt to my Soul: It has bro't me already into the greate&s;t Adver&s;ity: And unle&s;s I obtain Forgivene&s;s from thee, it will quickly plunge me into the Depth of irrecoverable and endle&s;s Mi&s;ery. This Argument, indeed, is very &s;urprizing in the Nature of it; and
<PB N="5" REF="003851_0006_100264D2C4E4DE60">
what one wou'd &s;carce chu&s;e to make u&s;e of, to ob|tain the Favour of an offended Neighbour or Bro|ther. For the greatne&s;s of our Offences again&s;t Men, is generally tho't a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on why they &s;hould retaliate upon us. And therefore a Confe&s;&s;ion of this nature to Man, does too often &s;erve only the more to irritate the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Injured again&s;t the Offender; and &s;ometimes, ac|cording as the nature of the Offence may be, it would put it out of the Power of tho&s;e to whom we confe&s;s to forgive. But it is far otherwi&s;e with re&s;pect to the infinite God. For, as we read in I&s;ai. 55.8, 9. <HI>My tho'ts are not your tho'ts, nei|ther are your ways my ways, &s;aith the Lord. For as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, &s;o are my ways higher than your ways, and my tho'ts than your tho'ts.</HI> And therefore &s;ince God's great de|&s;ign in forgiving Iniquity is to exalt free &amp; &s;ove|reign Grace thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the greater our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have been, the more illu&s;trious will his Mercy appear in the Act of Forgivene&s;s. And for this Rea&s;on among many others, he allows us, with <HI>David</HI> in the Text, to mention the greatne&s;s of our Iniquity, as an Argument why he &s;hould pardon and forgive us.</P>
<P>And now from the Words thus explained, we may make the&s;e three general Ob&s;ervations,</P>
<P N="1">I That God alone ought to be addre&s;&s;ed unto, for the Pardon of all our Iniquities.</P>
<P N="2">II. Whenever God pardons Iniquity, he par|dons it, <HI>for his own Name's Sake</HI>; or to magnify his free and &s;overeign Grace and Mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And therefore,</P>
<P N="3">III. Since this is God's chief End in pardoning Iniquity, the true Penitent may humbly plead the Greatne&s;s of his Sins, as an Argument with God, why he &s;hould pardon and forgive him.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="003851_0007_100204A8D02400F8">I. I &s;hall ob&s;erve from the&s;e Words, That God alone ought to be addre&s;&s;ed unto for the Pardon of all our Iniquities.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall not have time to enquire particu|larly into the Nature of a Pardon: Nor is there any need of it in this place: For &s;ince my pre|&s;ent De&s;ign is chiefly to direct and encourage &s;uch Sinners, as are deeply wounded with a &s;en&s;e of their own Sin and Guilt, in the &s;ure way to ob|tain the pardoning Mercy of God; every &s;uch Sinner mu&s;t needs under&s;tand &s;omething of the true Nature of a Pardon; and feel the nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;ee the worth of it, in his own Experience. And therefore I &s;hall only, Fir&s;t, Confirm the Truth of this Ob&s;ervation; and then, Secondly, Show after what manner a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Sinner mu&s;t make his Addre&s;s to God for his pardoning Mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall prove to you&punc; that God, and He alone, is to be &s;ought unto, for the Pardon of our Iniqui|ties And the Truth of this will appear in two particulars,</P>
<P N="1">1. All Sin is immediately and directly an Af|front to God. For as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in 1 Joh. 3.4. <HI>Sin is a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law of God.</HI> That is, all and every Sin oppo&s;es and tramples upon God's ruling Authority. And all they that are guilty of it, &s;et up them&s;elves, more or le&s;s, a|gain&s;t the Government of God, and <HI>practically</HI> &s;ay with the rebellious Jews, in Jer. 2.31. <HI>We are Lords, we will come no more unto thee.</HI> And 'tis upon this account only, that Sin contracts &s;uch Guilt as to need a Pardon. Indeed, in many Ca&s;es, one Man may really injure and grieve another. And, in all the&s;e Ca&s;es, we u&s;ually &s;ay, &s;uch a Man has &s;inned again&s;t his Brother or Neighbour. But then we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the real &s;infulne&s;s of &s;uch Actions ari&s;es only from the Contrariety of
<PB N="7" REF="003851_0008_100264D635275878">
them to that holy Law of God, which forbids this Ill treatment of Mankind. So that, in &s;trict pro|priety, God is the only Object again&s;t whom Sin <HI>is</HI> or <HI>can</HI> be committed. And therefore, in the Nature of the thing, it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable, yea, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary too that God, and he only, &s;hould be religiou&s;ly Addre&s;s'd unto, for the Par|don of Sin. And be&s;ides this,</P>
<P N="2">2. There is none but God, who can effectually forgive Sin. For Sin, as it expo&s;es the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or to eternal Mi&s;ery, is a matter of Concernment be|tween God and the Sinner only. The Sinner tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth the Law of God by his Iniquity, and the Ju&s;tice of God arre&s;teth the Sinner for his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: And thus God is offended, and the Sinner brought under a &s;entence of Condemna|tion, for one and the &s;ame Act of Sin. And there|fore as the Offence is again&s;t God only, there is none but he can relea&s;e a Sinner from the Guilt of Sin. And this is the meaning of that Confe&s;&s;ion, in Dan. 9.9. <HI>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivene&s;&s;es.</HI> And now &s;ince Forgivene&s;s, as it re&s;pects a Man's eternal &s;tate, belongs to God only, we ought &s;urely to ask this Forgivene&s;s of God, and of him alone: And it would be both impious and fooli&s;h in a Sinner, either to reque&s;t or expect a free and full pardon of his Sins from any el&s;e.</P>
<P>And having thus briefly confirm'd the Point&punc;</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I come now, in the next place, to con&s;ider how, or after what manner, we mu&s;t make our Ad|dre&s;s to God, for the Pardon of Iniquity, &s;o as to find Mercy with Him. And here I &s;hall &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1 When we pray to God for a Pardon, we mu&s;t pray with a deep &s;en&s;e of our utter Unworthine&s;s of the Mercy. For &s;uch is the odious and defiling Nature of Sin, that it vilifies and deba&s;es the Sub|jects of it, and renders them the proper Objects
<PB N="8" REF="003851_0009_100264D7B8A7D090">
for revenging Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And it is not po&s;&s;ible for a Sinner, on the account of any worthine&s;s in him, to challenge a Pardon, or claim any other Favour, at the hands of God. And therefore whenever we plead with God for a Pardon, and hope to find Mercy with Him, we mu&s;t go to the Throne of Grace, as it were, with A&s;hes on our Heads, and with Ropes on our Necks, and confe&s;s that we are Malefactors, ju&s;tly doom'd to eternal Wrath We mu&s;t take with us words, and either, &s;ay with <HI>the penitent Prodigal,</HI> in Luke 15.21. <HI>Father, I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven, and before thee; and am no more worthy to be called thy Child.</HI> Or, we mu&s;t confe&s;s with the repenting <HI>Jews,</HI> in Dan. 9 7. <HI>O Lord Righteou&s;ne&s;s belongeth unto thee; but unto us Confu&s;ion of faces.</HI> In a word, we mu&s;t freely acknowledge that Hell and the inconceiva|ble Torments of it, are our ju&s;t De&s;ert; and that every thing, on this &s;ide the everla&s;ting Burnings, is of the free &amp; &s;overeign Mercy of God to us. This we have &s;trongly recommended to us, in that peni|tent Language of the afflicted Church, Lam. 3.22. <HI>It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not con&s;umed, becau&s;e his Compa&s;&s;ions fail not.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. When we pray for the Pardon of Iniqui|ty, we mu&s;t make a free and full Confe&s;&s;ion of our Sins unto God. That is, we mu&s;t not only make a free and ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and the Aggravations of them, with which we find our Con&s;ciences op|pre&s;&s;ed and burdened: but we mu&s;t be led on by the&s;e to the corrupt Fountain from whence all our Actual Sins proceed, and particularly confe&s;s and bewail that Corruption of Nature we brought into the World with us. Of this <HI>David</HI> has left us a mo&s;t excellent Example, in the <HI>Fifty fir&s;t P&s;alm,</HI> which is full of penitential Grief and Sor|row for his &s;candalous Sins of Adultery &amp; Murder:
<PB N="9" REF="003851_0010_100264D93B85EA40">
for if we compare the 3<HI>d.</HI> &amp; 4<HI>th. ver&s;es</HI> with the <HI>Title</HI> of the P&s;alm, we &s;hall find that he makes a mo&s;t ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Sins in them. <HI>For</HI> (&s;ays he in his Addre&s;s to God) <HI>I acknowledge my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: and my Sin is ever before me. Again&s;t thee, thee only have I &s;inned, and done this evil in thy &s;ight: that thou mighte&s;t be ju&s;tified when thou &s;peake&s;t, and clear when thou judge&s;t.</HI> And then he traces the&s;e, and all the other &s;ins of his Life, to the accur&s;ed Fountain of them, in the ori|ginal Corruption of his Nature; and makes a mo&s;t &s;orrowful Confe&s;&s;ion of this, in the <HI>5th</HI> ver&s;e. <HI>Behold, I was &s;hapen in Iniquity; and in &s;in did my mother conceive me.</HI> And &s;uch a free and full Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin is generally nece&s;&s;ary to a Pardon: as appears from tho&s;e two Texts of Scripture, Prov 28 13. <HI>He that covereth his Sins &s;hall not pro&s;per: but who&s;o confe&s;&s;eth and for&s;aketh them &s;hall have mercy.</HI> And 1 Joh. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> 9 <HI>If we confe&s;s our Sins, he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our Sins, and to clean&s;e us from all Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. When we pray to God for the Pardon of our Iniquity, we mu&s;t pray for it in the Name of CHRIST, and hope to receive the Mercy for <HI>his Sake alone.</HI> For as Chri&s;t is the only MEDIATOR between God and the Sinner, &s;o he is the only Way of our Acce&s;s to the Father, and Acceptance with him. And therefore if we beg a Pardon, or ask any other Favour, in the Name of any one but Chri&s;t, God will cloath Him&s;elf with a thick Cloud, and turn a deaf Ear to our Prayer. <HI>But</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in 1 Joh 5.14.) <HI>this is the Confidence we have in him,</HI> i. e in Chri&s;t, <HI>that if we a&s;k anything according to his will he heareth us.</HI> And this holy Confidence is grounded upon that Promi&s;e of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour to his Di&s;ciples, Joh. 14 13, 14. <HI>And what&s;oever ye &s;hall ask [in my Name] that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
<PB N="10" REF="003851_0011_100204AA6754B1F0">
If ye ask any thing [in my Name] I will do it.</HI> And con&s;equently when a Sinner asks the Forgivene&s;s of Sin, with any rea&s;onable hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, it mu&s;t be in &s;ome &s;uch Language as this, Dan. 9.18, 19 <HI>O my God&punc; incline thine ear, and hear:&mdash; for we do not pre&s;ent our &s;upplications before thee for our righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es&punc; but for thy great mercies. O Lord hear, O Lord&punc; forgive, O Lord hearken and do, defer not, for thine own &s;ake</HI> [for thy dear Son's &s;ake] <HI>O my God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. La&s;tly, When we pray for a Pardon, we mu&s;t humbly re&s;olve and promi&s;e to God, that, by his Grace, we will for&s;ake all Iniquity. For to ask the Forgivene&s;s of Sin without &s;uch a purpo&s;e of Heart, and Engagement to God, is ba&s;ely to play the Hypocrite, and to dare the Almighty to take Ven|geance upon us. This, I think, appears very evi|dent from tho&s;e Words of the P&s;almi&s;t. P&s;al 66.18. <HI>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, the Lord will not hear me.</HI> But, on the other hand, when a Sinner goes to the Throne of Grace for a Pardon; if he finds his Heart broken for Sin, his Soul full of the hatred of it, and, with holy <HI>Job,</HI> is bro't to loath and abhor him&s;elf for his Iniquities; and with the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions is led on to &s;ay, as in <HI>Job.</HI> 34.32. <HI>Lord, if I have done Iniquity, I will &s;o no more.</HI> The&s;e are the Evidences of true Repentance. And &s;uch a Sinner, upon his asking, after this manner, &s;hall receive the Forgivene&s;s of his Sins, thro' the Merits and Mediation of Chri&s;t our Redeemer.</P>
<P>And thus I have fini&s;hed the fir&s;t general Head, and come now to my &s;econd Ob&s;ervation from the&s;e Words. And this is,</P>
<P N="2">II. Whenever God pardons Iniquity, he pardons it <HI>for his own Names Sake.</HI></P>
<P>This Propo&s;ition is evidently contain'd in the&s;e Words of the P&s;almi&s;t. <HI>For thy Names &s;ake, O Lord, pardon &amp;c.</HI> For here <HI>David</HI> makes u&s;e of the NAME
<PB N="11" REF="003851_0012_100264DAEB95AB48">
of God as the &s;tronge&s;t Argument for a Pardon: Which plainly implies that the Magnifying of God's Name, is the la&s;t &amp; highe&s;t End of Forgivene&s;s And that this is really the Ca&s;e, I think, no one can doubt when he reads that &s;olemn Declaration of God him&s;elf to his People I&s;rael, in I&s;a 43.25 <HI>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions for my own &s;ake, and will not remember thy Sins.</HI></P>
<P>But here we may, fir&s;t, briefly enquire into the meaning of this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>For thy Names &s;ake</HI> And, &s;econdly, Give you &s;ome Rea&s;ons to prove that when ever God pardons Iniquity he pardons it for his own Name's &s;ake.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall briefly enquire into the meaning of this Expre&s;&s;ion. <HI>For thy Name's &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>And here I &s;hall &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Name of God, in this place, we may under&s;tand the infinite Grace and Mercy of God. For this Mercy is &s;poken of once and again in this Context; and to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, for which the Name of God is mentioned in the Text. And this makes it mo&s;t probable that they both &s;ignify one and the &s;ame thing in this P&s;alm. And be|&s;ides, 'tis certain the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God is el&s;ewhere emphatically &s;tyl'd the <HI>Name</HI> of God; as tho' the Almighty eminently gloried in this Perfection of his Nature, and delighted chiefly in the di&s;play of it. This is evident from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s humble Reque&s;t to God, in Exod. 33.18 and God's conde&s;cending An&s;wer to it, in the 5<HI>th.</HI> and 6<HI>th.</HI> ver&s;es of the next Chapter&middot; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Petition to God is, <HI>I be&s;eech thee, &s;hew me thy Glory:</HI> And we have the An&s;wer referred to, in the following words. <HI>And the Lord de&s;cended in a Cloud, and &s;tood with him there, and proclaimed the Name of the Lord&middot; And the Lord pa&s;&s;ed by before him, and proclaimed the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long &s;uffering, and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth.</HI> Here we &s;ee the
<PB N="12" REF="003851_0013_100204AFB58D55D8">
Goodne&s;s and Mercy of God are expre&s;ly called, the Name of God&middot; And in this &s;en&s;e, <HI>For thy Name's &s;ake,</HI> is as much as to &s;ay, For thy Mercy's &s;ake, or to make a Di&s;play of the Riches and Glory of thy free Grace and Mercy. But &s;ince this Di&s;|play cannot be made but in a way con&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;&s;ential Rights of Divine Ju&s;tice; and &s;ince we know of no other way (to u&s;e the P&s;almi&s;ts words in P&s;al. 85.10.) wherein <HI>Mercy and truth may meet together: righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;s each other,</HI> in the Pardon of Sin, but only by the Death and Sacrifice of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; I add,</P>
<P N="2">2. It is not unlikely, that by the Name of God here, the P&s;almi&s;t might al&s;o have an Eye to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> For I make no doubt, &s;ince Chri&s;t was &s;o often &amp; clearly <HI>typified</HI> by the legal Sacrifices of old, that the be|lieving <HI>Jews</HI> had &s;ome way or other a Dependance upon the future Sacrifice and Satisfaction of the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, for the Pardon and Forgivene&s;s of their Sins; and that they frequently pointed to him in their Prayers to God for a Pardon. Now there is no one Expre&s;&s;ion which they commonly made u&s;e of, in this Ca&s;e, that has a clearer A&s;pect this way, than the Expre&s;&s;ion in the Text, <HI>For thy Name &s;ake.</HI> For the <HI>Name of God,</HI> we know was <HI>in the Angel,</HI> whom God &s;ent to conduct the <HI>I&s;rael|ites</HI> through the Wilderne&s;s (<HI>Exod</HI> 23.21.) By which Angel Chri&s;t is generally under&s;tood. And if &s;o, Why may'nt we rationally &s;uppo&s;e, that in Allu&s;ion to this, the <HI>Jews</HI> frequently &s;pake of the expected Me&s;&s;iah under this Character. <HI>The Name of God</HI>? Which if they did, <HI>For thy Names &s;ake</HI> here may &s;ignify as much as for the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias &s;ake,</HI> in whom thy Name is. And that which renders this the more probable is&punc; That the believing <HI>Jews</HI> made u&s;e of this Expre&s;&s;ion much after the &s;ame Manner, &amp; in the &s;ame Ca&s;es, wherein we Chri&s;ti|ans
<PB N="13" REF="003851_0014_100264DD67794538">
make u&s;e of the&s;e Words, <HI>For Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake</HI>: as tho' they &s;ignified one &amp; the &s;ame thing. And this Interpretation receives &s;till farther Light and Strength when we con&s;ider that <HI>David</HI> who made u&s;e of this Expre&s;&s;ion, was one to whom God had made wonderful Di&s;coveries, by the Spirit of Prophecy, of the future Death &amp; Sufferings of the Son of God in our Nature; and no doubt, reveal|ed to him, at the &s;ame time, the great Importance and Nece&s;&s;ity of them for the Pardon of Sin And therefore it is not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>David,</HI> when he was in &s;o great Concern to obtain the Pardon of Sin, as we find in this P&s;alm, cou'd ex|pect to obtain it, in any other way, than on the Account of the Death and Sacrifice of the promi|&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah And if this may be allowed a true Account of the Name of God, in the Text, then the full meaning of the P&s;almi&s;ts Petition in it, is this, Lord, pardon mine Iniquity, that thy free Grace and Mercy may be magnified, in and thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah. Where the magnifying divine Grace is to be con&s;idered as the <HI>principal End</HI> of Forgivene&s;s, &amp; the Merits of Chri&s;t as the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Medium</HI> to it And having thus briefly explained the Point, I proceed in the next Place</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To prove that whenever God pardons iniquity, he grants the Mercy upon no other Ac|count than only to di&s;play and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> if the Riches of his Grace, in and thro' the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this will fully appear in two Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1 There is a thing <HI>originally</HI> in the Sinner&punc; that can move the Lord to extend his pardoning Mercy to him Indeed&punc; when we con&s;ider a Sin|ner as he is a Subject of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> by rea|&s;on of Sin; &s;o he is a proper Object for mercy. But when we con&s;ider him under all the unhappy Cir|cum&s;tances the Fall has brought him into, this
<PB N="14" REF="003851_0015_100264DFDDCCE800">
quite alters the Ca&s;e with him. For it is with a Sinner, in this Re&s;pect, as it is with a Malefactor brought into Pri&s;on and Chains by a vicious Life. If we con&s;ider &s;uch an one, &s;imply in his afflicted &s;tate, he is a proper Object for Compa&s;&s;ion. But if at the &s;ame time, he appears ob&s;tinate in tho&s;e Vices which have brought all his Di&s;tre&s;s &amp; Ruin upon him; he cannot de&s;erve any Mercy &s;hou'd be extended towards him. And this is the very Ca&s;e with a Sinner when the Grace and Mercy of God fir&s;t finds him out. For we are not only mi&s;era|ble, and <HI>the Children of Wrath, by Nature:</HI> but we are naturally ob&s;tinate in tho&s;e Sins, which have bro't all our Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s upon us. For the Sinner, in his natural &s;tate, is in Love and League with Sin: at Enmity again&s;t God, from whom a|lone his Salvation mu&s;t come: and walks on in a con&s;tant Cour&s;e of tho&s;e Iniquities, which are the highe&s;t Provocation to Heaven. And there nei|ther is, nor can be any Alteration in him for the better: No Repentance for Sin: no godly Sor|row for Iniquity; 'till God of his free &amp; &s;overeign Grace, grants him Repentance unto life. And now, this being the true &s;tate of the Sinner by Nature, there can be nothing found in the Sinner, con&s;idered in him&s;elf, that may be tho't a &s;ufficient Motive to the Lord to extend his pardoning Mercy to him; &s;ince the very nece&s;&s;ary Qualifications of a Pardon, as well as the Pardon it&s;elf, are whol|ly from God. And from hence it plainly appears, That whenever God pardons Iniquity, he pardons it <HI>for his own Name's &s;ake.</HI> The Argument for a Pardon is wholly in him&s;elf, and not at all in the Sinner. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither the Sinner him&s;elf, nor any meer Creature, is able to pay the nece&s;&s;ary Price of a Pardon, to the Ju&s;tice of God, for him. For tho' God intends to magnify free and &s;overeign Grace
<PB N="15" REF="003851_0016_100264E34ED028F8">
in the Forgivene&s;s of Sin; yet he has no de&s;ign to exalt one Perfection of his Nature, to the Pre|judice of another. And therefore &s;ince Ju&s;tice is as dear to God as Mercy; he can never exalt his Mercy but in a way con&s;i&s;tent with the Rights of infinite Ju&s;tice. Now Ju&s;tice indi&s;pen&s;ibly re|quires full Satisfaction for the Offence, before the Bands of Guilt be loo&s;ed, and the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or di&s;charged. What this Satisfaction mu&s;t be, ap|pears from the nature of Sin, which is infinitely evil; not <HI>&s;imply,</HI> but <HI>objectively</HI> con&s;idered. And, for this Rea&s;on, the Price of Forgivene&s;s mu&s;t be of infinite Value to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ar a full proportion to the nature of the Offence, and from hence it evidently appears that no meer Creature can pay &s;uch a Price as this to Divine Ju&s;tice; for 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, in the Nature of things, that a finite Being &s;hould be able to pay an infinite Price. And the nece&s;&s;ary Conclu&s;ion from this, is, that if ever Satisfaction be made to the Ju&s;tice of God for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, God him&s;elf mu&s;t <HI>provide,</HI> as well as <HI>accept</HI> the Price. And &s;uch a Price God has provided, in giving his only begotten Son to die a Sacrifice for Sin; and his Ju&s;tice has accepted it, on the Account of all that truly Repent and believe in him. And now the concluding Argument, from the whole, is this, That whenever God magnifies his Mercy in par|doning Iniquity, it is, and can be, only for his <HI>Name's &s;ake,</HI> that is, for his Son's &s;ake, or upon the account of the infinite Merit of his Death and Sa|crifice. And now I have done with the &s;econd general Propo&s;ition, and come to ob&s;erve, in the la&s;t place,</P>
<P N="3">III. That &s;ince God's great End in pardoning Iniquity, is to magnify his infinite Grace &amp; Mercy in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the truly penitent Sinner may humbly plead the Greatne&s;s of his Sins, as an Ar|gument with God, why he &s;hould confer his par|doning Grace upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003851_0017_100204B14EE4B6B0">I &s;ay, the <HI>truly penitent</HI> here, becau&s;e this was the Ca&s;e with <HI>David,</HI> when he made u&s;e of the Argument, in the Text, <HI>O Lord, Pardon mine Ini|quity: for it is great.</HI> And without this Repen|tance, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for a Sinner, by all the Ar|guments in the World, to prevail with the Lord to pardon his Iniquity: For our Saviour has pe|remptorily told us (in Luk. 13 3, 5) <HI>That except we repent we &s;hall certainly peri&s;h.</HI> But, on the other hand, if the Sinner has <HI>a truly broken and contrite Heart</HI> in him: if he finds his Soul full of Grief, and Sorrow, and holy mourning for Sin: full of the Hatred of Sin, full of &s;elf-loathing on the Account of it; and humbly re&s;olves, by the Grace of God, never to have any thing more to do willingly with Sin: He is then a fit Object for pardoning Mercy. And, in this holy Frame and Temper, he may go to the Throne of Grace&punc; and, with Humility and Confidence, make u&s;e, even of the Greatne&s;s of his Sins as a prevailing Argument with God for a Pardon</P>
<P>And there are the&s;e two Rea&s;ons with which I &s;hall confirm this comfortable Doctrine to the penitent Soul.</P>
<P N="1">1. The greater our Iniquities have been&punc; the more do we need the pardoning Mercy of God For the more notorious and aggravated a Sinner's Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have been, the greater is the Guilt he has contracted by them: and unle&s;s he obtains the Forgivene&s;s of them, he mu&s;t certainly &s;uffer a heavier Vengeance for them. And thus the greate&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors are in the mo&s;t deplorable Ca&s;e, and are under the mo&s;t amazing Condemna|tion. And now, &s;ince the proper Objects of Mercy are <HI>mi&s;erable</HI> Creatures; the more mi&s;erable they are in them&s;elves, the fitter Objects are they for Mercy And Mercy never works with tenderer Bowels, or with more melting Compa&s;&s;ions, than
<PB N="17" REF="003851_0018_100264E507367368">
while it has to do with the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Objects. And from this Con&s;ideration, the penitent Sinner, who finds him&s;elf deeply wounded with a Sen&s;e of his own Sin, and Guilt, and Mi&s;ery, may take Encouragement to go to the only Phy&s;ician of pe|ri&s;hing Souls, and to &s;pread his deplorable &s;tate before him, in &s;ome &s;uch Language as this.
<Q>Lord, I have &s;trangely play'd the Prodigal, and run away from thee, ever &s;ince I was born, &s;peaking lies. I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son. Mine Iniquities are increa&s;ed beyond Account; and they have been attended with the&s;e and the other the mo&s;t aggravated Circum&s;tances. I have abu&s;ed thy Grace and Patience towards me, as much as ever any wretched Creature has done; and may ju&s;tly account my &s;elf, <HI>the very Chief of Sinners.</HI> And by rea&s;on of my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which are of a crim&s;on and &s;carlet dye, I have expo&s;ed my &s;elf to thy hotte&s;t Wrath and Vengeance: And un|le&s;s I obtain pardoning Mercy from thee, my Condemnation, at the Day of Judgment, and my mi&s;erable Portion in Hell, will for ever be more intollerable than <HI>that</HI> of the Sinners of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI>: Nor did any poor Wretch ever &s;tand in more need of thy pardoning Mercy than I do. <HI>For thy Name's &s;ake,</HI> therefore: For thy Mercies &s;ake in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>O Lord, pardon mine Iniquity: for it is</HI> exceeding <HI>great,</HI> and my mi&s;erable Condition is inexpre&s;&s;ibly, yea, in|conceivably great on the account of it.</Q>
And now, if there is any thing, the penitent Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or can &s;ay or do, that is likely to move the Divine Compa&s;&s;ions towards him: nothing &s;eems to have a more promi&s;ing tendency this way, than &s;ome &s;uch ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ions as the&s;e. And therefore, for a true Penitent, to mention the Great|ne&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="003851_0019_100204B481D3FCB0">
of his Sins, after this manner, is as proper an Argument as he can make u&s;e of, to obtain Forgive|ne&s;s from God. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. The greater our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have been, the more will the Mercy of God be magnified in pardoning of them. For &s;ince God's chief de&s;ign in Forgivene&s;s, is to di&s;play the Glory of his free and &s;overeign Grace in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the greater tho&s;e Sins are which he forgives, the more illu&s;tri|ous will his Mercy appear in the Act of Forgive|ne&s;s. For the Riches of Divine Grace and Mercy appear to be no le&s;s than infinite, when the great|e&s;t Unworthine&s;s is over-look'd, and the mo&s;t crim&s;on Guilt is removed, by them. Hence, in this way, <HI>the &s;uper-abounding Grace of God</HI> is occa&s;io|nally illu&s;trated from <HI>the Abounding of Sin;</HI> as the Ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ures us in <HI>Rom</HI> 5.20. And he el&s;ewhere confirms this Truth to us in his own Example. For when he fir&s;t acquaints us what a great Sinner he had been: That he had been <HI>a Bla&s;phemer, a Per&s;ecutor, and Injurious,</HI> in 1 Tim. 1.13. He tells us in the next ver&s;e, that in his obtaining Mercy, <HI>the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant.</HI> And indeed, the Mercy of God never appears more illu&s;trious than it does, in Re&s;cuing the mo&s;t mi&s;erable and unworthy Objects from De&s;truction. For in &s;uch In&s;tances, the Grace of God di&s;covers it &s;elf to be Almighty-Grace, and that nothing can be too hard for it. And &s;ince this is the true &s;tate of the Ca&s;e, what &s;hould hin|der the true Penitent from going to the Throne of Grace, and pleading thus with the Almighty? e&s;pecially if he knows his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have ex+ceeded.
<Q>Lord, my Sins have been many, and at|tended with the highe&s;t Aggravations: I nei|ther know the Number nor the heinous Guilt of them But this I am &s;ure of, tho' my Offen|ces have abounded, thy Grace and Mercy in
<PB N="19" REF="003851_0020_100264E9888AB8C8">
Chri&s;t Je&s;us have abounded much more. And thou ha&s;t taken Occa&s;ion heretofore, highly to magnify thy Grace in pardoning the Chief of Sinners: Yea, the greater their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have been, the brighter Di&s;play ha&s;t thou made of thy free and &s;overeign Grace in the Forgive|ne&s;s of them. O therefore take Occa&s;ion once more, from the <HI>Heinou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of my Sins, to &s;hew forth the infinite Riches of thy Mercy. And if thou wilt forgive my crim&s;on and &s;carlet Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, thy Grace &s;hall forever have the Prai&s;e of it, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q>
And now for the Penitent Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or to mention the Greatne&s;s of his Sins, after this manner, is certainly plea&s;ing in the Sight of God; and &s;o mu&s;t be as proper an Argument, as he can make u&s;e of to prevail with the Almighty to extend a Pardon and Eternal Salvation to him.</P>
<P>And thus I have gone through the doctrinal Handling of the&s;e words, and come now to the APPLICATION of them, in two general Heads.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t is,</P>
<P>I By way of &s;olemn <HI>Caution</HI> and <HI>Warning</HI> to all, e&s;pecially to our profane Children and Youth, who are madly running on in the ways of Sin, and have hitherto ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to be reclaimed, by all the Means and Methods that have been u&s;ed with them for this End&punc; I &s;ay, I &s;hall improve what has been &s;aid by way of &s;olemn Caution and Warning to all &s;uch as the&s;e. For there is nothing more natural to carnal Sinners than ba&s;ely to abu&s;e the Doctrine of Divine Grace and Mercy: and to take Occa&s;ion, from the Con&s;ideration of it, to in|dulge their unruly Lu&s;ts and Corruptions. For whenever they hear this Doctrine preach'd, name|ly, <HI>Where Sin has abounded, Grace has much more abounded,</HI> (which Doctrine was delivered only for the Encouragement and Con&s;olation of &s;uch Sin|ners,
<PB N="20" REF="003851_0021_100264EB0BDE0A48">
as are in deep Di&s;tre&s;s and Angui&s;h, and have their Hearts broken, at the &s;ight of their great Sin and Guilt before God) I &s;ay, when they hear this Doctrine of Divine Grace, di&s;played in all the Glories of it, they pre&s;ently make a mi&s;application of it; and &s;ecretly &s;ay, This is comfortable Doc|trine indeed: For I &s;ee now that my Sins can ne|ver be too many for God to pardon. Nay, the greater they are, the more illu&s;trious will the Grace of God appear at la&s;t in the Pardon &amp; Forgivene&s;s of them. And &s;ince it is thus, &s;ays the ungrateful Wretch, I may &s;afely continue &s;till longer in my Sins, and take my fill of &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures; and am re&s;olved to do &s;o, and make no doubt but the Grace of God will abound, at la&s;t, in my Pardon and Salvation. And if the profane Sinner be in his Youthful Days, he will pre&s;ume upon long Life; and, from the Doctrine of Divine Grace, hope for the Mercy of God, after a long Life &s;pent in Sin and Rebellion again&s;t Heaven. But, O vain and deluded Sinner! This is horrid Pre|&s;umption in the &s;ight of an holy, Sin-hating, and Sin-revenging God. And therefore the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> ju&s;t after he had delivered this comfortable Doctrine, for the ea&s;e of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Con&s;ciences, fore-&s;eeing the infinite Hazard many would be in of abu&s;ing it to the vile&s;t purpo&s;es, &s;olemnly warns all profane Sinners again&s;t this fatal Abu&s;e of it, in Rom. 6. beginning. <HI>What &s;hall we &s;ay then? &s;hall we continue in Sin, that Grace may abound? God forbid!</HI> Which is a form of Speech he frequently made u&s;e of&punc; to &s;how his ut|ter abhorrence of any great Iniquity, And there|fore I now &s;olemnly &s;ay to all profane Sinners, and particularly to our gracele&s;s Children and Youth; <HI>God forbid,</HI> That any of you &s;hould con|tinue one Year, one Day, or &s;o much as one Hour longer in Sin, with hopes that the Grace
<PB N="21" REF="003851_0022_100204BA5FD0E1D8">
of God will hereafter abound in your Pardon and Salvation. And to &s;et home this &s;ea&s;onable Cau|tion, this &s;olemn Warning, I mu&s;t be&s;eech, and, in the Name of God, demand your &s;erious Con&s;i|deration of a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Con&s;ider, Your pa&s;t Iniquities are very many, and exceedingly aggravated already. For tho' &s;ome of you are but Young in Years, yet you are Old in your Iniquities: For you have all been Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors from the Womb, and been guilty of innumerable Sins every Day, &s;ince you have come to the Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on. And as all your Sins have been again&s;t Go&s;pel Light and Grace, they have been dreadfully aggravated on this account. And many of your Sins have been of the mo&s;t heinous Nature: &s;uch as Cur&s;ing, Swearing, Lying, Stealing, Prophaning the Name and Day of God, Uncleanne&s;s, and the like. So that every &s;uch Sinner, tho' ever &s;o young in Years, has infinite Rea&s;on already to make his Prayer to God, in the words of my Text, <HI>O Lord, pardon mine Iniquity: for it is great.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, If you don't &s;peedily repent and reform, 'tis not unlikely, God may, in a little time, utterly for&s;ake, and give you up to tho&s;e mo&s;t no|torious and &s;candalous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which will quickly bring you to a mo&s;t &s;hameful and igno|minious Death, by the Hands of Publick Ju&s;tice. For have we not here, before our Eyes, a mo&s;t fearful Example of two mi&s;erable Men, and one of them too in the very <HI>prime</HI> and <HI>vigour</HI> of Youth, who but a <HI>twelve month</HI> ago, it may be, as little tho't of ever coming to &s;o ignominious a Death, as the mo&s;t &s;ecure of you all. But behold, by the ju&s;t Judgment of God, they appear, in this va&s;t A&s;&s;embly, with their Lives forfeited into the Hands of Publick Ju&s;tice; and are under a Sentence of Condemnation to die in a few Hours, for their no|torious
<PB N="22" REF="003851_0023_100264ED8A453A08">
and &s;candalous Crimes. And unle&s;s you &s;peedily repent and return to God, and commit the keeping, both of your Bodies and Souls to Him, in a way of well doing, you can have no &s;ecurity but this will be the mi&s;erable portion of &s;ome or other of you, before you have &s;een the Revolution of another Year. But &s;uppo&s;e, after all the crying Sins your own Con&s;ciences are wit|ne&s;&s;es to, you &s;hould e&s;cape the Hands of Publick Ju&s;tice: Yet,</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider, 'Tis likely God will take you into his own Hands, and &s;peedily inflict his more im|mediate and more terrible Vengeance upon you. For this has frequently been the dreadful Doom of &s;uch bold and Heaven daring Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, as many of you are. For did not <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu, Hophni</HI> and <HI>Phineas,</HI> die &s;uddenly in their Youth, for their horrid Prophanene&s;s and Impiety? Were not <HI>Annanias</HI> &amp; <HI>Sapphira</HI> &s;uddenly &s;truck dead, by the Hand of God, with a Lye in their Mouths? And have you not read or heard of many others, whom God has made the amazing Examples of his Ven|geance, in this way? And were not all the&s;e Ex|amples intended by God for a &s;olemn Warning to all others? O then think &s;eriou&s;ly on them, you that upon every turn, are ready to imprecate the Vengeance of God, and to wi&s;h you may either rot alive, or may die, or be damned, or the like, if you either did, or would do, this or the other thing. And, at the &s;ame time, con&s;ider how ju&s;t it would be, for, God to take you at your Word, and to &s;end you into the Congregation of the Dead, with this vi&s;ible Mark of his fiery Indignation up|on you</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould e&s;cape with Impunity in this World, and &s;hould live to grow old in Years as well as in Sin; Yet after all,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="23" REF="003851_0024_100264EF26E21230">4. Con&s;ider, 'Tis mo&s;t likely God will deny you his Grace at la&s;t, and bring the Damnation of Hell upon you in the long run. For the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> has told us&punc; from the Mouth of God, in in Chap 65.20. <HI>That the &s;inner being an hundred years old &s;hall be accur&s;ed.</HI> And con&s;equently the longer he lives in Sin, the more aggravated will be his eternal Damnation. And Oh, that every Chri&s;tle&s;s and Gracele&s;s Sinner in this A&s;&s;embly, and particularly the prophane Children and Youth in it, might be &s;o impre&s;t from the&s;e Con&s;iderati|ons, as to be ready to hearken to all the Warnings and Coun&s;els that are given them from God, both by his Word and Providences!</P>
<P>And here, upon this awful Occa&s;ion, I would, with all earne&s;tne&s;s, be&s;eech our tho'tle&s;s Youth, and all others that are madly walking in the ways of their own Hearts, and in the &s;ight of their Eyes, to hearken to the &s;olemn Warnings that have been frequently given, by Condemned Criminals, at the Time and Place of their Execution. For the&s;e are certainly Warnings from the Dead, if there are any &s;uch given us in this World. What you may hear from the&s;e mi&s;erable Men, or how far they may think it their Duty, in their dying Moments, to give Glory to God, in this way, I know not But I am certain that &s;ome others when they have been greatly awakened, at the near Pro&s;pect of Death and Eternity, have given the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;on|able and &s;olemn Warnings to their vain Compa|nions, and to all Spectators, to beware of tho&s;e Sins which have led on by degrees to their tragical End. And they are u&s;ually &s;uch as the&s;e. Their early Di&s;obedience to their Parents; Their re&s;i&s;ting and grieving the &s;triving Spirit of God: Their Neglect of Prayer: Their De&s;pi&s;ing the Sabbaths of the Lord, and turning a deaf Ear to the many Warnings and Coun&s;els that were given to them in the Mini&s;try of the Word: Their prophane
<PB N="24" REF="003851_0025_100264F1B1410240">
Cur&s;ing and Swearing, and taking the Name of God in vain: Their intolerable Pride: Their un|governable Pa&s;&s;ion: Their frequent running into bad Company: Their Drunkenne&s;s: Their Un|cleanne&s;s: Their Theft, and the like. And there|fore as you would not fall after their fatal Exam|ple, Oh! beware of the&s;e Heaven during Sins, which without a &s;ea&s;onable and thorow Repentance, will inevitably lead to the like, or a much wor&s;e De|&s;truction. And let all tho&s;e who&s;e con&s;ciences witne&s;s to their own Guilt, in any of the&s;e re&s;pects, be per&s;waded to fly in&s;tantly to the Blood of Chri&s;t for the Pardon of all their pa&s;t Sins. Pray earne&s;tly for a new Heart: make an entire Dedi|cation of your &s;elves to God now in &amp; thro' the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and commit the keeping of your &s;elves to Him, in a way of well-doing. And in this way you may rea&s;onably expect the re&s;train|ing, the &s;anctifying, and the comforting Influences of God's holy Spirit while you live, and hope for eternal Life in the World to come.</P>
<P>And this leads me now to the next Head of Im|provement. And this is,</P>
<P N="2">II. By way of <HI>Direction</HI> and <HI>Encouragement.</HI> Fir&s;t, To all &s;uch Sinners who are in Di&s;tre&s;s and Angui&s;h from a Con&s;ideration of the Greatne&s;s of their Sins. And Secondly, to the poor condemned Criminals in particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall &s;ay a word for the Con&s;olation and En|couragement of all &s;uch Sinners who are in deep Di&s;tre&s;s and Angui&s;h, from a con&s;ideration of the Greatne&s;s of their pa&s;t Sins. For there have been (and, doubtle&s;s there are at this day) many poor Sinners, who, under very awakening Convictions, have had &s;uch a doleful Pro&s;pect of the heinous Nature of their pa&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, that they have been ready to conclude, they have &s;inned them|&s;elves beyond all Hopes of Recovery; and that
<PB N="25" REF="003851_0026_100264F428BAA6A8">
now there can be no Mercy in &s;tore for them. They have &s;inned, it may be, again&s;t former Mer|cies and Means, and, perhaps, notoriou&s;ly broke their former &s;olemn Vows and Engagements made to God in a &s;erious Frame: and the very tho'ts of the&s;e things are ready to drive them into utter De|&s;pair. And therefore when they have gone to ask Coun&s;el of the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, or any other experienced Chri&s;tians, they have frequently made the&s;e or the like mournful Enquiries. Did God ever forgive &s;uch a vile Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or as I have been? one who has &s;o often, and for &s;o long a time, been daring the Vengeance of Heaven a|gain&s;t me? Is it po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch as I am &s;hould ever obtain Mercy from God? Can there be any Grace in &s;tore for me? &amp;c. Now to every &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul I can an&s;wer, with all A&s;&s;urance, in the Affirmative, and &s;ay, <HI>Yes</HI>; God has forgiven many a Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or&punc; as great as you have been: For &s;uch were <HI>Mana&s;&s;ah, Mary Magdalen,</HI> and many more. And 'tis po&s;&s;ible you may obtain Mercy, at the hands of God, as well as they. Nay, 'tis very probable there is Grace particularly in &s;tore for you And this I will venture to &s;ay fur|ther for your Encouragement, That if you hearti|ly bewail and lament your Sins before the Lord, the greatne&s;s of your pa&s;t Sins will be &s;o far from being a hindrance to a Pardon, that they will ra|ther move the Lord &s;peedily to take pity on you, under your di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Circum&s;tances. For the Grace of God can as ea&s;ily triumph over the great|e&s;t, as over the lea&s;t Unworthine&s;s: And he is as ready to forgive the greate&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, to the truly penitent, as to pardon the lea&s;t Iniquity. And therefore if you will but improve the Liberty you may take at the Throne of Grace, and plead with <HI>David</HI> in the Text, <HI>For thy names &s;ake, O Lord, pardon mine Iniquity&punc; for it is great</HI>; you
<PB N="26" REF="003851_0027_100204BD0C28C330">
may be &s;ure of a gracious An&s;wer For God him|&s;elf, who cannot deceive, has promi&s;ed, <HI>That if we confe&s;s and for&s;ake our Sins, we &s;hall find Mercy.</HI> Prov. 28.13. And to encourage you to lay hold on this, and &s;uch like Promi&s;es, he has further &s;aid, in I&s;ai 55 7. <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI></P>
<P>And this leads me now,</P>
<P N="2">2. To direct my &s;elf to the poor Condemned Criminals in this A&s;&s;embly. And what a word of Encouragement does this Subject afford to you in your pre&s;ent mo&s;t deplorable Condition. Ala&s;s! mi&s;erable Men! we heartily mourn your &s;ad State and Doom. For tho' your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have been many and great and your Iniquities have found you out, and you are to be cut off this Day, from the Land of the Living; the one for a <HI>cruel Murder</HI>; and the other for a vile <HI>Burglary</HI> and Theft, which is now made a <HI>capital</HI> Crime, by the whole&s;ome Laws of the Land; yet our Bowels are moved with the tendere&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion for you: and we heartily wi&s;h and pray for your Eternal Salvation. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s 'tis with Fear and Trembling what the Event may be. For when we con&s;ider the great Advantages you have had, &s;ince your Trial and Condemnation, fir&s;t, in the mercy of the Government, in &s;paring you &s;o long from Execution; and then, in the unwearied pains which &s;ome of the faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t have taken with you: In the fir&s;t place, to lay be|fore you the mi&s;erable State you are in, by the Breach of the fir&s;t Covenant between God and Man; and, in the next place, to give you a true Go&s;pel Account of the New-Covenant way to Eternal Life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: And when we con|&s;ider that after all this, you have (e&s;pecially one

of you) too frequently given way to Intemperance, and in the Exce&s;s of Drink and Pa&s;&s;ion have often vented a Rage and Madne&s;s, far unbecoming the &s;tate of true Penitents. I &s;ay, when we con&s;ider the&s;e Things, we can't but have a great Jealou&s;y lea&s;t the Grace of God has been be&s;towed upon you in vain. But, O wretched Men! I pray you would not mi&s;con&s;true this Plainne&s;s: nor look upon it as an Effect of Ill-will, or of an unchari|table Temper, or as if I mention the&s;e things to drive you now at la&s;t into a De&s;pair of the Mercy of God. No, God knows it proceeds from a &s;en&s;e of Duty, and from a tender Compa&s;&s;ion for your pre|cious and immortal Souls; if now in the la&s;t hour or two of Life, you may be brought to a &s;aving Repentance. And therefore, if we can mini&s;ter any Light and Direction to you, under your pre|&s;ent Darkne&s;s; any Word of true Support and Comfort to your &s;inking Spirits; or be any ways helpful to you in your &s;peedy Preparation for Death and Eternity: The Searcher of all Hearts knows how ready we are, to do all we can for you, in the&s;e Re&s;pects. And ag<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ably, if your mi&s;erable and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Circum&s;tances have now at la&s;t been a means to revive the Convictions of God's Spirit in you, and thereby to bring you into a deep Concern for the Salvation of your peri&s;h|ing Souls (which is our earne&s;t Prayer to God for you) then, what you have heard at this Time mu&s;t bring a rich Cordial to your fainting Souls. For have your Sins been very many and great? Je&s;us the Son of God is a great Saviour, <HI>and able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to God by him.</HI> Are they of a crim&s;on and &s;carlet dye?

a&s;&s;ure you from the holy Scriptures, that God now invites, intreats, and commands you to come unto him for eternal Life and Salvation. And you may go to him, under all your Sin and Guilt, and even make u&s;e of the greatne&s;s of your Sins, as an Argument to move his eternal Compa&s;&s;ions towards you <HI>For, behold, now is the accepted Time: behold, now is the Day of Salvation:</HI> tho' alas! This is the very la&s;t of your Days of Grace, and this the la&s;t publick Call you are ever like to have to Repentance and Salvation, before you die. Oh then, mi&s;erable Men, fly to a SAVIOUR now, as to your only Refuge; fly to him in&s;tantly: for, behold, ETERNITY, ETERNITY is at the Door: and you mu&s;t, before this Sun is &s;et, enter into an awful Eternity: And now is the only Time you are ever like to have to prepare for that Eter|nity. Oh then, I &s;ay again, fly to the Almighty JESUS this moment. Ca&s;t your&s;elves down at his merciful Feet: Smite upon your Brea&s;ts, and let each of you cry out, in Agony of Soul, <HI>God be merciful to me a poor Sinner.</HI> Beg of God the deepe&s;t Repentance for all your pa&s;t Sins, and particularly for the Sins for which you &s;tand Con|demned to die: Plead with him for a new Heart: Be earne&s;t with him for a &s;aving Faith in Chri&s;t. And when you have done this, then lift up your Eyes to Heaven, and you may behold the Al|mighty REDEEMER, with the Arms of his Mercy open to receive you And you may ari&s;e and run into them for Eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>And, in particular, as you are now going to meet <HI>the King of Terrors,</HI> in the mo&s;t formidable Appearance, Oh! beg &s;peedy Preparation for Death, that you may be able to meet it with a &s;uitable Frame of Spirit: That, in your dying Moments, you may give Glory to God, by a mo&s;t penitent Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin; by expre&s;&s;ing a lively Faith in

Chri&s;t; by a &s;tedfa&s;t Hope of eternal Life; and by a chearful Re&s;ignation of your Spirits into the Hands of our glorious God and Saviour. And in this way, tho' the Death of the Body may be ignomini|ous and &s;hameful, the Reproach of it will be done away in the Day of Chri&s;t's Appearing, when e|very true Penitent &s;hall appear with him in Glory. But, Oh! mi&s;erable Men! I cannot take my leave of you, 'till I ob&s;erve to you, That if after all the Means and Pains that have been u&s;ed with you, both in private and publick, you &s;hould die in a &s;tate of Impenitency, with a reigning Enmity in your Hearts again&s;t the Ble&s;&s;ed God, and with an unforgiving Spirit towards Men; <HI>which God forbid</HI>: then all the &s;olemn Applications that have been made to you now, and at other &s;ea&s;ons, &s;ince your Condemnation, will &s;erve only to aggravate your dreadful Doom, at the Great Day, and your E|ternal Mi&s;ery in the World to come. But while you remain fit &s;ubjects for it, our Prayers &s;hall be, that all may mini&s;ter to your Eternal Salvation. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>_THE &s;orrowful occa&s;ion upon which the foregoing very perti|nent and pathetical &s;ermon was preach'd, is told us in the <HI>title-page.</HI> One of the&s;e criminals, namely, <HI>Matthew Cu&s;hing,</HI> was an unhappy youth, who had not &s;een <HI>twenty two years</HI> in the world. I &s;uppo&s;e there has not at any time been a criminal among&s;t us more talk'd of, and who&s;e circum&s;tances have &s;o rung thro' the town and country. Many of the reports that have gone abroad, I am very &s;ure are fal&s;e and groundle&s;s; for this rea&s;on, as well as to gratify the de&s;ires of &s;ome &s;erious per&s;ons, who would willingly know what ef|fect all the means of grace u&s;ed with him had upon him, I &s;hall endeavour to give a plain and faithful account of his behaviour after his condemnation, and at the time of his execution, &s;o far as it came under my knowledge and ob&s;ervation: And it may be, the honour of God, and good of others may be &s;omething &s;erved by it.</P>
<P><PB REF="003851_0032_100264FC307CD398">He was born at <HI>Limerick</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> of Roman catholick parents. What impre&s;&s;ions of religion he had receiv'd were in their way; but the&s;e were very &s;mall, and next to none. He left his parents when he was about &s;ixteen years of age, but was never &s;o happy as to fall in the way of religious in&s;truction, or a good example. And therefore when I fir&s;t &s;aw him after his condemnation, I found him as ignorant as you can well &s;uppo&s;e a rational creature to be, who had ever liv'd in tho&s;e countrys that are call'd chri&s;tian. But as he greatly needed in&s;truction, &s;o he &s;eem'd to me to have a good natural capacity for it, and to be very de&s;irous of it. He entreated me to &s;ee him as often as I could, and that it might be daily if I could &s;pare him the time; and always receiv'd my vi&s;its to him with all thankfulne&s;s. He likewi&s;e de&s;ir'd to hear the word of God in public, which was readily granted him: And &s;o he con&s;tantly attended the <HI>Lecture</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;days,</HI> and on <HI>Lords-days</HI> where he cho&s;e for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>By the ble&s;&s;ing of God on the&s;e means u&s;ed with him, he in a little time attain'd to &s;ome good degree of knowledge in the things of God and &s;alvation; tho' he was not able to read, which was a great hindrance to his progre&s;s in knowledge, and made the labour of tho&s;e that in&s;tructed him much the harder. And when he thus became a little better in|&s;tructed, he would &s;peak of his unhappine&s;s
<PB REF="003851_0033_100204C799383128">
in the want of a good education; and &s;ay of him&s;elf, that in time pa&s;t <HI>he knew little more than a bruit.</HI> No wonder then he was, (to u&s;e the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI>'s expre&s;&s;ions) <HI>as a hor&s;e, or a mule, which hath no under&s;tanding; who&s;e mouth mu&s;t be held in with bit and bridle.</HI> I mention this to excite parents very carefully to bring up their children in <HI>the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</HI> as one powerful means of re&s;traint when they grow up: And to let our catechized in&s;tructed youth know, that by their &s;inning again&s;t &s;uch a religious edu|cation as they have been favour'd with, their &s;ins become more heinous in the &s;ight of God, than the &s;ins of others, &s;uch as he was.</P>
<P>The arrows of conviction al&s;o &s;eem'd at times to &s;tick in him. He us'd frequently to confe&s;s his &s;ins, and bewail him&s;elf on the account of them with crying and tears; &s;peaking of him&s;elf as an <HI>over-grown &s;inner,</HI> for whom he was afraid there was no mercy; and lamenting not only the &s;infulne&s;s of his life, but of his heart &amp; nature as the &s;ource and &s;pring from which all proceeded: And was divers times over-heard in his pri&s;on chamber, in the night time e&s;pecially, ear|ne&s;tly pleading with God in prayer.</P>
<P>But at other times his behaviour was with much levity &amp; unconcernedne&s;s The vain and incon&s;iderate people that re&s;orted to the pri&s;on yard, and were almo&s;t continually
<PB REF="003851_0034_100264FDB5B2B828">
calling to and talking with him, were a great hurt and &s;nare to him; &s;o that he was once or twice &s;adly overcome with &s;trong drink; and being of a very quick and ha&s;ty natural temper, he once and again fell into violent tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion, wherein <HI>the language of hell</HI> which he had &s;o us'd him&s;elf to before, was utter'd by him in a mo&s;t &s;hocking man|ner, and under a kind of &s;atanic impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>By and by again he would bewail him&s;elf, and &s;eem'd a&s;toni&s;h'd at the prodigious wick|edne&s;s of his own heart, the enmity, (or <HI>ve|nom,</HI> as his own word was) which he found there again&s;t God and holine&s;s. After one &s;uch fit I remember he &s;aid to me, <HI>He had carried him&s;elf &s;o as to make every body hate him, and he did not wonder at it, for he now hated him&s;elf more than others could hate him.</HI> And added, <HI>That he now &s;aw if it were po&s;&s;ible for him to go to heaven with &s;uch a nature as his, not chang'd &amp; renew'd, heaven would be no heaven to him, but a place of unea&s;ine&s;s and mi&s;ery rather.</HI></P>
<P>Thus there were frequent &s;truggles between &s;trong convictions and raging corruptions, till on the very day before his execution he fell into as bad a frame is he had been in at all, wherein his <HI>tongue</HI> was as it were <HI>&s;et on fire of hell.</HI> This gave the greate&s;t concern and anxiety of mind to tho&s;e whome had been la|bouring for his conver&s;ion, and u&s;ing the means of &s;alvation with him, in hopes he
<PB REF="003851_0035_100264FF38A00090">
might be found among the elect of God; and made them ready to give up all hope con|cerning him, and begin to fear whether he would not even die raging &amp; cur&s;ing, or lay violent hands on him&s;elf before hand, as I know he had been tempted to do.</P>
<P>But by degrees the tran&s;port went off, &s;o that in the beginning of the evening, he again appear'd to be in a mo&s;t humble, broken, pe|nitent frame. A Mini&s;ter of the Town <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. <HI>Byles.</HI></NOTE> who now went in to &s;ee him, tells me, <HI>He never &s;aw a man in &s;o perfect an agony. O Sir,</HI> &s;aid he to the Mini&s;ter upon his going in, <HI>Can you think there are any hopes of me?</HI> The Mini&s;ter replyed, <HI>I &s;aw you in &s;o good a frame ye&s;terday, that I began to conceive good hopes con|cerning you.</HI> He an&s;wered, &mdash;<HI>But I have this day been cur&s;ing and &s;wearing again! &mdash; Oh! was there ever &s;uch a wicked heart as mine?&mdash; I &s;ee I can't tru&s;t to my own re&s;olutions! &mdash;Oh! if I &s;hould be in &s;uch a frame to morrow when I am to die!</HI> And the tho't and fear of this &s;eem'd greatly to di&s;tre&s;s him, and make him cry to God for help.</P>
<P>He now de&s;ir'd &s;ome body might read to him &s;ome &s;uitable portions of the holy &s;crip|tures, which was done till late at night: and the remainder of the night, a great part of it
<PB REF="003851_0036_100204CEB8D368B8">
at lea&s;t, he &s;pent&punc; as tho&s;e that watch'd at the place have told me, in earne&s;t prayer to God.</P>
<P>And now the awful and deci&s;ive day is come on, on which he appear'd compos'd and prayerful, and expre&s;s'd a humble re&s;ig|nation to the will of heaven in his death; declaring <HI>he mattere'd not what his body&punc; &s;uffer'd here, if it might be well with his &s;oul hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>As he went to the place of execution, he was full of earne&s;t &s;hort addre&s;&s;es to heaven, &s;uch as the&s;e; <HI>Lord, be merciful to me a Sin|ner! &mdash; I am an overgrown Sinner! Lord GOD! &s;earch me! &mdash; O turn my &s;oul over and over!</HI> [By which he meant that the work of grace in him might be a perfect &amp; through work] <HI>Lord, let my death be &s;anctified to all the&s;e peo|ple, that they may all, every one of them take warning by me!</HI> He now &s;pake of his <HI>late &s;ins,</HI> as the mo&s;t aggravated &s;ins of his life, and lying mo&s;t heavy upon him.</P>
<P>Being come to the gate at the end of the town, he look'd up upon it and cried, <HI>Lord! let the gate of heaven now be open to receive me, as this gate is open to me to go thro'!</HI></P>
<P>Being arriv'd at the place of execution, tho' he in &s;ome circum&s;tances &s;hew'd &s;uch pre&s;ence of mind as &s;ome were ready to won|der at, yet nothing I think that could ju&s;tly be call'd &s;tupidity or hardne&s;s. He declar'd
<PB REF="003851_0037_10026501B08737C0">
<HI>he was not afraid of the death he was to &s;uffer, only of appearing before his judge.</HI> With a loud voice he warn'd the &s;pectators of tho&s;e &s;ins and vices, which had fill'd up his &s;hort life, and ripen'd him for the judgments of God. And when the public prayer made on the oc|ca&s;ion was over, to which he compo&s;edly at|tended, then he fell into an <HI>agony,</HI> and in his <HI>agony he prayed</HI>; and never did I hear &s;uch piercing cries go up to heaven, at which ma|ny hundreds were di&s;&s;olv'd into tears. With unutterable angui&s;h he &s;ent up &s;uch petitions as the&s;e, <HI>O Lord God, be merciful to me a poor &s;inner! O Lord, &s;ave a peri&s;hing &s;inner, that is peri&s;hing before God and man! Let me not pe|ri&s;h in this world and in the other too!</HI> And now he call'd to the &s;pectators, <HI>O pray for me, for I an't able to pray for my &s;elf!</HI> In the&s;e petitions he made Chri&s;t his plea and argument, &s;aying, <HI>Lord, &s;ave me thro' the means of thy Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t! His blood is &s;ufficient! His blood is &s;ufficient! He came to &s;ave the chief of &s;inners. O Lord God, draw me to thy Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t!</HI>&mdash; So when <HI>the &s;or|rows of death compa&s;s'd him, and the pains of hell gat hold upon him, and he found trouble and &s;orrow, he call'd upon the name of the Lord, O Lord, I be&s;eech thee to deliver my &s;oul.&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have given a plain narrative of matter of fact. I pronounce nothing at all upon it. It becomes us to leave him in the hands of a &s;overeign, righteous, and mer|ciful

God, who&s;e judgment, and not ours, has the di&s;po&s;al of him. There is no oppor|tunity further to try the &s;incerity of his re|pentance. Whether <HI>the &s;trong man arm'd,</HI> who &s;trove &s;o violently to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e, was in the la&s;t conflict overcome and turn'd out, and the &s;pirit of God became triumphantly victorious, and <HI>re&s;cu'd the prey from the mighty,</HI> we mu&s;t not know till the great day of the manife&s;tation of all things.</P>
<P>If the ca&s;e &s;hould be as bad as any may fear, and there was not after all a true work of grace wro't in this mi&s;erable man, we may learn this from it, <HI>That conver&s;ion, wherever it is wro't, is the work of free, &s;overeign, almighty grace.</HI> It is not in the power of men or means to convert a &s;inner; nor is it in the power of a &s;inner to convert him&s;elf. The fear of death and hell, in the near views of them, will not work a &s;aving &s;anctifying change in the &s;oul. A &s;inner may &s;ee his &s;ins, &amp; have great concern for them, and yet not hate them &s;o as to turn from them. He may &s;ee his duty, and yet not have a heart to do it. He may &s;ee his danger, and yet run upon it. He may &s;ee the day of death and judgment near; and yet not do any thing to purpo&s;e in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;alvation.&mdash; Where then is that <HI>free-will,</HI> and tho&s;e powers of nature which &s;ome &s;o earne&s;tly plead for? Therefore, <HI>O unconverted &s;inner,</HI> &s;ee and ac|knowledge, God of his free grace mu&s;t work

all your works in you and for you. If you have any tho'ts of turning to him, beg of him not to leave you to your &s;elf. Be infi|nitely afraid of doing any thing to provoke him to take his holy Spirit from you. Let <HI>Ephraim</HI>'s prayer in the day of his conviction be yours, <HI>Turn thou me, and I &s;hall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.</HI></P>
<P>To have done; I am hot without hopes God intends good to &s;ome &s;ouls by means of this providence. I have ob&s;erved in times pa&s;t, &s;ome or other have been awakened by the publick di&s;cour&s;es on &s;uch &s;olemn occa|&s;ions. And if what a mini&s;ter intends more particularly for the benefit of one, is &s;et home by the Spirit of God on another, free-grace will &s;till be glorified, and a &s;oul &s;aved. We mu&s;t leave it to God to <HI>&s;hew mercy to whom he will &s;hew mercy</HI>; and none <HI>may find fault with his will. For my tho'ts are not your tho'ts, neither are your ways my ways, &s;aith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, &s;o are my ways higher than your ways, and my thot's than your tho'ts.</HI></P>
