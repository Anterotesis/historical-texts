<P>Solomon being a man full of wi&s;dom was very ob&s;ervant of the Providences of God which hapned in the Place, and in the Age wherein he lived. He doth in this Chapter give us an account of &s;ome of his ob|&s;ervations that way. There is one &s;pecial Ob|&s;ervation in this Context <HI>viz.</HI> in the 15 ver&s;e of this Chapter, where we have the <HI>wi&s;e man</HI> &s;aying, <HI>There is a Ju&s;t man that peri&s;heth in his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and there is a wicked man that pro|longeth his life in his wickedne&s;s.</HI> Now le&s;t any one &s;hould abu&s;e this Doctrine of the ju&s;t mans <HI>peri&s;hing</HI> in his <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and the wicked mans <HI>prolonging his life</HI> in his <HI>wickedne&s;s,</HI> He proceeds to a double exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">1. He doth exhort to beware of Errors on the right hand <HI>ver.</HI> 16. where there are two Errors on the right hand mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. Over much Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Be not right|eous overmuch.</HI> Not that it is po&s;&s;ible for any man to have more of real Goodne&s;s in him than he ought to have: but he may be more righteous in his own conceit, then he &s;hould be, and he may be Super&s;titious, he may add
<PB N="2" REF="000394_0003_0FA5A898D1F4EC80">
to the Word of God which is the <HI>Rule</HI> of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; Men may likewi&s;e be more &s;e|vere in puni&s;hing offenders than the Rule does allow of&punc; the Corinthians did &s;ometimes err on that hand. And that is to be righteous over much.</P>
<P N="2">2. Overmuch Wi&s;dome, <HI>Neither make thy &s;elf overwi&s;e</HI>: Which mu&s;t be under&s;tood as the former particular; A man may be wi&s;er in his own eyes then he ought to be, he may be wi&s;e above what is written, He may pry into the &s;ecrets of the Almighty, and en|deavour to trace him who&s;e wayes, are pa&s;t finding out, and who&s;e Foot&s;teps are not known.</P>
<P>And this Exhortation is urged from the Con&s;ideration of the woful Effect of this over|much Wi&s;dom and Righteou&s;nes <HI>viz.</HI> Self de|&s;truction. <HI>Why &s;hould&s;t thou de&s;troy thy &s;elf?</HI> As the Moth that will venture too near to the Light, de&s;troyeth it &s;elf, &s;o they that will be over-wi&s;e, and will needs know more then God would have them to know, de&s;troy them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other Exhortation is again&s;t Errors on the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Dru&s;is Annot. in locum.</NOTE> Left hand; of which there are two mentioned in this ver&s;e &amp; in the words which have been read in oppo&s;ition to the 2 former &s;poken of in the ver&s;e immediately foregoing.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Be not overmuch wicked.</HI> q. d. though you mu&s;t not be righteous over-much, yet take
<PB N="3" REF="000394_0004_0FA5A89B931767C8">
heed of erring on the other extream, which our nature is mo&s;t prone unto. The Hebrew word is [<HI>do not wickedly much.</HI>] not that the Preacher does allow of any wickedne&s;s at all, only his de&s;ign is to &s;how the evil of all <HI>exce&s;s</HI> in wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Error on the left hand is Fool|i&s;hne&s;s: <HI>Neither be thou fooli&s;h.</HI> Heb. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Noli e&s;&s;e &s;tultus. <HI>Hieron.</HI></NOTE> [<HI>neither be thou a fool.</HI>] becau&s;e all wickedne&s;s is <HI>folly,</HI> and &s;inners are fools, as afterwards we &s;hall &s;hew. And this exhortation is likwi&s;e pre&s;&s;ed by an argument taken from the mi&s;erable end that &s;uch &s;inners come to at la&s;t. God in his righteous Providence does many times &s;o order that they dye before their time. <HI>Why &s;hould&s;t thou dye before thy time?</HI> It is as if it were &s;aid, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Tamet&s;i ut improbi in &s;uis &s;celeribus con&s;cene&s;cant, tamen <HI>epi to polu</HI> fit ut improborum brevis et contracta vita fit, <HI>Cart|wright</HI> in loc.</NOTE> Though it be &s;o that here and there a wicked man doth prolong his life in his wickedne&s;s, yet for-any one thence to-imbolden him&s;elf in &s;in, is the greate&s;t folly imaginable; for u&s;ually it falls out otherwi&s;e, that wickedne&s;s doth <HI>&s;horten</HI> the dayes of tho&s;e that are guilty, of it&punc;</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> therefore from the words is,</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>That the Providence of God doth oftentimes &s;o di&s;po&s;e, as that an</HI> untimely death <HI>&s;hall be the portion of him that hath been wicked over much.</HI></P>
<P>In the Doctrinal handling of this Truth,
<PB N="4" REF="000394_0005_0FA5A8A04A4F6F50">
Three Things may be attended; 1. To en|quire how any one may be &s;aid to <HI>dye before his time.</HI> 2. What <HI>Over-much wickedne&s;s</HI> that <HI>is</HI> which is u&s;ually followed with untimely death, or when one may be &s;aid to be wicked <HI>over-much.</HI> 3. The Rea&s;ons of the Doctrine, why God in his Providence doth often &s;o di&s;po&s;e as that an <HI>untimely</HI> death &s;hall be the Portion of &s;uch as have been wicked over-much.</P>
<P>Q. 1. <HI>How can one be &s;aid to dy before his time?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;w. <HI>Not in re&s;pect of the</HI> Decree <HI>of God.</HI> No man &s;hall dye before the time which the Lord hath determined be fulfilled. The time of every mans death is appointed. Hence <HI>Job</HI> &s;aith <HI>Chap.</HI> 14.14. <HI>All the dayes of my</HI> appoint|ed <HI>time will I wait till my change come</HI>&punc; and in the 15 ver&s;e of that Chapter it is &s;aid, <HI>Seeing his dayes are determined, the number of his months are with thee, th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t</HI> appointed <HI>his bounds that he cannot pa&s;s.</HI> Not only the years but the moneths, nay the <HI>dayes</HI> which every man &s;hall live are determined by the Lord, &s;o as that he &s;hall not live a <HI>day</HI> longer, nor die a <HI>day</HI> &s;ooner than was before appointed. But a man may be &s;aid to dy before his time,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In re&s;pect of his own expectation.</HI> He may die before ever he doth expect death; Hence &s;inners are &s;aid to die <HI>&s;uddenly,</HI> 1. The&s;. 5.3. <HI>When they &s;hall &s;ay peace and &s;afety, then &s;udden de&s;truction cometh upon them, as travel upon a woman with child, and they &s;hall not e&s;cape.</HI> Sud|Sudden
<PB N="5" REF="000394_0006_0FA5B78D4695A758">
de&s;truction cometh upon &s;inners, i. e. not only which is in it &s;elf &s;udden, but as to their expectation &s;o. Thus in the <HI>Parable</HI> concerning the wicked &s;ervant, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.48, 49, 50. <HI>If that evil &s;ervant &s;hall &s;ay, &mdash; my Lord</HI> delayeth <HI>his Coming,&mdash;the Lord of that &s;ervant &s;hall come in a day when he looketh</HI> not <HI>for him, &amp; in an hour that he is not</HI> aware <HI>of.</HI> So doth he die before his time wherein he expected death is come. It is often &s;o with them that have been very wicked and fooli&s;h; wherefore it is &s;aid in the parable concerning the Fool when he thought he had many years to live <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.20&punc; <HI>God &s;aid unto him, thou Fool this night &s;hall thy &s;oul be required of thee.</HI>&mdash; Hence,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A &s;inner may be &s;aid to dye before his time, in re&s;pect of his preparation for a dying hour.</HI> Death may come upon him before he is pre|pared to encounter with that enemy: and then he dyeth indeed, <HI>In dying he &s;hall dye,</HI> if death find him unprepared, the <HI>&s;econd</HI> death taketh hold on that &s;oul. The Devils &s;ome|times &s;aid to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>art thou come to tor|ment us before our time</HI>? Truly &s;uch a &s;oul go|eth to the place of Torment before the time There is many a &s;inner that death finds with|out an intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, there is &s;ome &s;in that he hath not repented of, nay it may be he hath not <HI>truly</HI> repented of &s;o much as <HI>one</HI> &s;in, and then he is not prepared to dye. It had been better for him that he had never been
<PB N="6" REF="000394_0007_0FA5B78DB4A42688">
been born, than that he &s;hould dye and go out of the world in that condition.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A &s;inner may dye before that time be fulfill|ed, which according to the ordinary cour&s;e of na|ture he might have lived.</HI> And this is e&s;peci|ally intended here in the Text, <HI>why &s;hould&s;t thou die before thy time?</HI> Hebr. <HI>and not in thy time,</HI> that is to &s;ay before that time which ac|cording to the ordinary cour&s;e of nature thou mighte&s;t have lived, be expired. Many times the Divine Providence doth &s;o order as that they who have been wicked over-much &s;hall not live out <HI>that</HI> time. Thus concerning the world of the ungodly which lived before the floud, <HI>Eliphaz</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Ha&s;t thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden, who were cut down out of time</HI> Job. 22.15, 16. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Caryl on Job. <HI>22.16.</HI></NOTE> According to the ordinary cour&s;e of nature, they might have lived a long time, but they were cut down by the &s;troke of Death. Wicked men never dye before they are ripe in &s;in, but they often dye before they are ripe in nature. They are carried and cha&s;ed out of the world by &s;ome violent death.</P>
<P>Sometimes this is brought to pa&s;s by the Lords immediate hand. If men be generally wicked over-much, the Lord &s;ends publique de&s;troying Judgements whereby Thou&s;ands dye before their time: So on the old world,
<PB N="7" REF="000394_0008_0FA5B78EB4AC0628">
&s;o on Sodom and Gomorrha, in the morning they were well and likely to have lived many a fair day, but dead and damned before night. Tho&s;e &s;ore Judgements of Famine, Plague, and Sword, come and &s;weep away multitudes before their time, when a people are become wicked over much. And particular Judge|ments do hence come upon partiular Per&s;ons, whereby they are cut off before their time. There was that wicked <HI>Er,</HI> and his wicked brother <HI>Onan,</HI> did commit abominable un|cleane&s;s in the &s;ight of God, and therefore the <HI>Lord &s;lew them</HI> that they <HI>dyed before their time.</HI> So <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> were wicked over much, and there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they dyed before the Lord. <HI>Corah</HI> and his Complices, <HI>wickedne&s;s was among&s;t them and in their Dwellings,</HI> and as the P&s;almi&s;t (alluding to that very Judge|ment) &s;peaketh, <HI>Death &s;eized upon them&punc; and they went down quick into hell.</HI> P&s;al. 55.15. <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira</HI> were wicked over much when they committed Sacriledge, and al&s;o &s;in|ned and lyed in a Church A&s;&s;embly, where there is a &s;pecial pre&s;ence of the Spirit of God and thence became guilty of Lying to the Ho|ly Gho&s;t, wherefore fir&s;t the one of them fell down, &amp; gave up the gho&s;t, &amp; then the other, and thence were both ca&s;t into one grave, and this before their time. The Scripture is full of awful In&s;tances to this purpo&s;e. Again,
<PB N="8" REF="000394_0009_0FA5B79151761F90">
&s;ometimes Gods Vicegerents are improved as his executioners of his wrath and ju&s;tice up|on &s;uch &s;inners. The Magi&s;trate beareth not the Sword in vain, but is the Mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Hence <HI>David</HI> &s;peakes &s;aying, <HI>I will early de&s;troy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off the wicked doers from the city of the Lord.</HI> P&s;al. 101.8. I will early de&s;troy them, in the Original it is <HI>in the morning</HI> I will de|&s;troy them, becau&s;e in tho&s;e times Malefactors were executed in the Morning, and thats his meaning, that he would &s;ee execution done upon Capital Offenders. Thus <HI>Saul</HI>'s cur&s;ed po&s;terity was cut off by the hand of Ju&s;tice, becau&s;e of the Murder which their Father had committed, and no doubt but they had been &s;ome way acce&s;&s;ary, in con&s;enting or aprove|ing, or not duly bearing witne&s;s again&s;t that iniquity.</P>
<P>Sometimes again, The Lord in a Judicial way giveth up &s;uch &s;inners to the power of Satan and their own Corruptions, &s;o as that they become their own executioners, as we &s;ee in Judas, who after he had brought him&s;elf under the guilt of inocent bloud, went to the Halter to let out his wretched &s;oul.</P>
<P>But thus much may &s;uffice to be &s;poken to the fir&s;t enquiry.</P>
<P>We come to the &s;econd thing propounded,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="000394_0010_0FA5B791A3314318">Namely, <HI>What Over-much wickedne&s;s that is which is u&s;ually followed with</HI> untimely death? <HI>or when may a man be &s;aid to be</HI> wicked over-much?</P>
<P>An&s;w. 1. <HI>When he doth make him&s;elf more wicked than indeed he is.</HI> e. g. When he doth fal&s;ly accu&s;e him&s;elf to be <HI>guilty</HI> of this or that which he was never actually guilty of. There are &s;uch woful fooli&s;h Creatures in the world that glory in their &s;hame, and take a pride in &s;aying that they have committed this or that abomination, which yet it may be they never did commit: It is ju&s;t with God that &s;uch &s;hould <HI>dye before their time,</HI> &amp; that they &s;hould be dealt with as if they were really guilty thereof; as we &s;ee in the in&s;tance of that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|malekite</HI> who accu&s;ed him&s;elf as having an hand in Sauls death, it's a que&s;tion whether he had &s;o really or no, yet inasmuch as he accu&s;ed him&s;elf, David condemned him, 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.16. <HI>David &s;aid thy bloud be upon thy head, for thy mouth has te&s;tifyed again&s;t thee &s;aying, I have &s;lain the Lords Anointed.</HI> So when any poor Creat|ure &s;hall &s;ay that he has <HI>out-&s;tood</HI> &amp; &s;inn'd away the day of grace, albeit the Holy Spirit is &s;e|cretly &s;triving with him &s;till, or that he hath &s;inned again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; or that his &s;in is greater than the Mercy of God. As <HI>Francis Spira</HI> after his Apo&s;tacy uttered &s;uch de&s;pe|rate Bla&s;phemy as that, <HI>My &s;in</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>is greater than the mercy of God.</HI> And thus it was

Some have ob&s;erved that Cains de&s;peration and Bla&s;phemy was a greater evil than his <HI>Murther</HI> was, when he &s;hed the inocent blood of his own Brother.

<P N="2">2. <HI>When a man &s;hall become guilty of &s;uch &s;ins as are of a very hainous nature, then he may be &s;aid to be wicked overmuch.</HI> There are &s;carlet &s;ins, Crim&s;on abominations which the Hea|vens blu&s;h to behold.

<P>To mention only one or two Crimes,</P>
<P><HI>Murther</HI> is a great and horrid Wickedne&s;s, and &s;o Capital as that whoever has been guilty of it may in no ca&s;e be pardoned by man. <HI>Numb.</HI> 35.30 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">1. <HI>Who&s;o killeth any per&s;on the murtherer &s;hall be put to death, moreover they &s;hall

The Jews have a Traditi|on that <HI>Lamech</HI> killed Cain and a young man that was with him hunting in the woods; To this purpo&s;e &s;ome under&s;tand that place (our Ver&s;ion doth evidently favour that Inter|pretation) <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.23, 24. <HI>Lamech &s;aid I have &s;lain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

Joab murthered Abner and Ama&s;a, and he (though an old man) dyed be|fore his time, he that had &s;hed the bloud of others, his own bloud was &s;hed for it at la&s;t. <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> con&s;pired again&s;t <HI>Zachariah</HI> and &s;toned him with &s;tones, and afterwards <HI>His own &s;erv|ants con&s;pired again&s;t him and &s;lew him.</HI></P>
<P>Many other in&s;tances are recorded in Script|ure and in humane writings all confirming the truth of this. Yea, God from Heaven doth

u&s;ually pur&s;ue this &s;in with &s;pecial &s;ignal te&s;ti|monies of his righteous di&s;plea&s;ure.

<P>The Story <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch.</NOTE> is ancient and famous concern|ing <HI>Be&s;&s;us,</HI> who had murthered his own Fa|ther, and &s;ometime after the &s;wallows making a noi&s;e in the Chimney (as it is the manner of tho&s;e birds to do) His guilty Con&s;cience was affraid they had told of him, whereupon he goeth to kill the Swallows, and being asked the rea&s;on, why (&s;aid he) the &s;wallows do nothing but &s;ay <HI>Be&s;&s;us hath kill'd his Father, Be&s;&s;us hath kill'd his Father</HI>: Whereby he was &s;u&s;pected, and upon Examination confe&s;&s;|ed the fact.</P>

What is the Buckler of the Almighty? It is the Word of God. And what are the thick Bo&s;&s;es of that Buckler? They are the Threatnings and Sanctions annexed to that Word.

<P>And thus have we done with the &s;econd thing propounded in order to the clearing of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> before us. We come to the <HI>third</HI> Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> To enquire into the Rea|&s;ons of this Doctrine,</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="000394_0019_0FA5B79830FA6420">Que&s;t. 3. <HI>Why doth God in his Providence oftentimes &s;o di&s;po&s;e as that an</HI> untimely death <HI>&s;hall be the Portion of him that hath been wicked over much?</HI></P>
<P>For An&s;wer, we &s;hall only mention two <HI>Rea|&s;ons,</HI> breifly.</P>
<P>Rea&s;. 1. <HI>The Lord doth this that He may manife&s;t his righteous Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t &s;in.</HI> Hab. 1.13. <HI>He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity,</HI> that is to &s;ay with aprobation, or without dete&s;tation and Indignation again&s;t &s;in. The Ble&s;&s;ed holy God doth bear an infinite dete&s;tation and Indigna|tion again&s;t Sin. Hence He leaveth <HI>Marks of his Di&s;plea&s;ure</HI> upon the &s;inner. As God &s;et a Mark upon Cain's forehead; &s;o He &s;ets a Mark of Di&s;plea&s;ure upon notorious Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Yea &s;ometimes when he for|giveth the &s;in, yet he doth vi&s;it with tempo|poral vengeance, that &s;o the world might &s;ee that &s;in is odious and abominable in the &s;ight of God&punc; Hence &s;uch &s;inners as the Text &s;peak|eth of, mu&s;t <HI>dye before their time.</HI></P>
<P>Rea&s;. 2. <HI>That &s;o others may thereby be warned and deterred from the Commi&s;&s;ion of the like evils.</HI> Thus it was with <HI>Lot</HI>'s wife, &s;he dyed before her time, that &s;o others might be warned by her Example, to beware of becoming guilty of the &s;ame &s;in, which &s;he was &s;o awfully puni&s;hed for: therefore Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Luk.</HI> 17.32. <HI>Remember Lot's wife</HI>: meaning
<PB N="19" REF="000394_0020_0FA5B798DCC900D8">
<HI>&s;o</HI> remember her, as that you may for ever take heed of doing as &s;he did. She was turn|ed into a <HI>pillar of Salt,</HI> that others might be &s;ea&s;oned thereby and pre&s;erved from the like evil. God is wi&s;e and wonderful in his Pro|vidences, and knoweth how to order the death of <HI>two or three</HI> &s;o as to prevent the De&s;tructi|on of <HI>many</HI> thereby. Hence He has appointed that Ju&s;tice &s;hall be <HI>executed</HI> in a <HI>Solemn</HI> way upon <HI>Capital offenders,</HI> that others may hear and fear and none may doe any more &s;o wickedly. We find the Lord Him&s;elf giveth this rea&s;on of this matter <HI>Deut.</HI> 13.8,&mdash; 11. <HI>Thou &s;halt not hearken unto him neither &s;hall thine eye pitty him, neither &s;halt thou &s;pare, but thou &s;halt &s;urely kill him: And all I&s;rael &s;hall hear &amp; fear and &s;hall doe no more any &s;uch wickedne&s;s as this is among you.</HI></P>
<P>We come now to apply this Doctrine. There are two U&s;es to be in&s;i&s;ted on, 1. by way of <HI>In&s;truction</HI> or <HI>Information,</HI> 2. by way of <HI>Ex|hortation.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. By way of <HI>Information.</HI></P>
<P>Inform. 1. <HI>We may &s;ee by this, that Sin is the greate&s;t Folly in the world.</HI> Well might <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ay as in the Text, <HI>neither be thou fool|i&s;h,</HI> For to &s;in and doe wickedly, is the great|e&s;t Fooli&s;hne&s;s that ever was or can be. Sin is a Departure from the Rule of Wi&s;dome. For a man to part with his life for <HI>nothing?</HI> is
<PB N="20" REF="000394_0021_0FA5B79DC606C920">
not that mon&s;trous Folly? And thus doth a wretched &s;inner doe. Mens &s;ins are unfruit|ful works of darkne&s;s. <HI>What profit had you of tho&s;e things whereof ye are now a&s;hamed?</HI> Sin is the mo&s;t unprofitable thing in the world: It is good for nothing, neither for body, nor Soul, nor Name, nor E&s;tate, but brings Death and Ruin upon all. A man by Sin (e&s;pecially &s;ome &s;ins) loo&s;eth his Name. <HI>A wound and di&s;honour doth he get, and a reproach that &s;hall not be wiped away.</HI> And he loo&s;eth his life, and that <HI>before his time</HI> as the Text &s;heweth; yea and without Repentance will lo&s;e his &s;oul for ever. <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.36&punc; <HI>He that &s;inneth again&s;t me wrongs his own &s;oul.</HI> The Impenitent Sinner brings ruin upon his own &s;oul. Therefore Sin is folly, and the more &s;inful the more fool|i&s;h: The greate&s;t &s;inners, are the greate&s;t <HI>Fools</HI> in the world. Wherefore it is &s;aid <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9.3. <HI>The heart of the &s;ons of men is full of evil, and madne&s;s is in their heart while they live, and after that they goe to the dead.</HI> Yea to the damn|ed! Oh what horrible madne&s;s is it, for any man, that &s;o he may enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on, to venture the eternal Damn|ation of his precious and immortal &s;oul.</P>
<P>Inform. 2. <HI>It follows from hence, that Short|ne&s;s of dayes is in it &s;elf a Judgement.</HI> For it is threatned as a puni&s;hment or wickedne&s;s. It is a fruit of &s;in, and of the cur&s;e: If Adam had
<PB N="21" REF="000394_0022_0FA5B7A090424EC8">
not &s;inned there would have been no &s;hort lives, none of his Po&s;terity &s;hould have had their lives &s;hortned. And in the times of the Re&s;titution of all things, when the Cur&s;e &s;hall be removed, it will not be as at this day, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.4. <HI>There &s;hall be no more death.</HI> To be &s;ure there &s;hall be no more &s;uch <HI>untimely</HI> death as our eyes do with &s;adne&s;s behold this day. Look, as <HI>long life</HI> is in it &s;elf a ble&s;&s;ing, and therefore is promi&s;ed as &s;uch in the Scripture <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 91.16. <HI>With long life will I &s;atisfie him,</HI> Prov. 4.10. <HI>Receive my &s;ayings, and the years of thy life &s;hall be many</HI>&punc; and 10.27. <HI>The fear of the Lord prolongeth dayes.</HI> Whatever any true believer hath done or &s;uffered for, or ac|cording to the will of God, whil&s;t he was in the world, &s;hall come in upon the account at the la&s;t and great day, a glorious reward of mercy &s;hall be given for it; thence is it &s;o great a mercy to live long. So on the other hand, Short life is a great Judgment, and is often threatned as &s;uch in the Scripture, <HI>Prov.</HI> 10.27. <HI>The years of the wicked &s;hall be &s;hortned.</HI> Eccle&s;. 8.13. <HI>Neither &s;hall be prolong his dayes.</HI> And it is mentioned as an heavy imprecation, P&s;al. 109.8. <HI>Let his dayes be few.</HI> For when a wicked man dyeth (dying in his &s;ins) he is undone for ever: when once his body is <HI>gone down into the pit</HI> of the grave, and his &s;oul is <HI>gone down into the pit</HI> of eternal Darkne&s;s, he cannot hope for the mercy of God, he cannot
<PB N="22" REF="000394_0023_0FA5B7A2C5035340">
hope for pardon of his Sin, he cannot hope for the &s;alvation of his &s;oul. Therefore &s;hort life is in it &s;elf a judgment. Only as to the Elect of God it is turned into mercy. As Af|flictions are in them&s;elves evil, and fruits of the Cur&s;e, but to Believers they become the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings: So an untimely death is in it &s;elf a great evil, but to one that belongs to the Election of Grace, it becometh a wonder|ful mercy, for it ha&s;teneth his eternal happi|ne&s;s and glory.</P>
<P>Inform. 3. <HI>Hence it likewi&s;e follows, that Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is the way to obtain Long Life.</HI> If Wick|ne&s;s bring untimely death, then <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s will deliver from death.</HI> There is no righteous man but &s;hall live in this world &s;o long as life &s;hall be good for him to enjoy.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But &s;ome one will &s;ay, do we not &s;ee that good men dye when they are <HI>young</HI> as well as others?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Very true: As there are &s;ome that are <HI>too wicked to live long</HI>; So there are others that are <HI>too</HI> good <HI>to live long,</HI> in &s;uch an evil wretched world as this. Jeroboam's godly Son dyed in his youth. Jo&s;iah a mo&s;t eminent &s;ervant of the Lord, dyed in the mid&s;t of his dayes. Enoch, though the be&s;t man, and the be&s;t Mini&s;ter of God in all the world in his time, was taken out of the world before he had lived half &s;o long as men in tho&s;e dayes
<PB N="23" REF="000394_0024_0FA5B7A36C4E3190">
were wont to live: but then it would not be good for them to live any longer. God is <HI>only wi&s;e</HI> and faithful, and therefore He takes his &s;ervants to him&s;elf when he &s;eeth that life will not be be&s;t for them. Be&s;ides, a man may live <HI>long in a little time</HI>: It is &s;aid <HI>the child &s;hall dye an hundred years old</HI> I&s;a. 65.20. Tho' a child in re|&s;pect of years, yet he &s;hall have the grace &amp; gra|vity, the wi&s;dom and knowledg of a man that has liv'd an hundred years. And indeed that is mo&s;t de&s;irable. It is a great Mercy in many re|&s;pects, to be freed from the prevailing Infirm|ities of old age, and therfore to live <HI>long</HI> in a <HI>little time</HI> is mo&s;t de&s;irable. As I remember Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> in an Epi&s;tle which he hath prefixed to one of Mr <HI>Norton</HI>'s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr Cotton's Epi&s;tle before Mr. Norton's Orthodox Evangeli&s;t.</NOTE> Books taketh notice of it with re&s;pect to Dr. <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> that it was <HI>his con&s;tant de&s;ire affectation and expre&s;&s;ion, that he might live long in a little time,</HI> and the Lord grant|ed him his de&s;ire of heart therein. Some live longer in &s;even years, than others do in <HI>ten</HI> times &s;even years. They <HI>doe</HI> more for God, and more for his People in &s;even years, than others doe in twenty, forty, three&s;core, or in four&s;core years. Moreover that promi&s;e of <HI>long life</HI> will be fulfilled to the righteous in the life to come. As indeed all promi&s;es (and threatnings too) are fully accompli&s;hed in the
<PB N="24" REF="000394_0025_0FA5B7A42859CDB0">
world to come. <HI>There</HI> the righteous &s;hall <HI>live for ever.</HI> It was promi&s;ed to Chri&s;t, that he &s;hould be &s;atisfied with long life, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 91. <HI>ult.</HI> And that he &s;hould <HI>prolong his dayes,</HI> I&s;a. 53.10. Yet we know that Chri&s;t was not in this world much above two and thirty years: how then did he prolong his dayes? in the other world his dayes are prolonged to <HI>Eternity,</HI> according to the Scripture <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 21.4. <HI>He asked life of thee, and thou gave&s;t it him, length of dayes for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>&V;&s;e.</HI> 2. Let it be a word of <HI>Exhortation.</HI> 1. Here is a <HI>general</HI> word of Exhortation, 2. more particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us all be exhorted to make a right im|provement of &s;uch awful Providences as the Text &s;peaks of.</HI> There is &s;uch a providence before us this day, which has occa&s;ioned me to &s;peak from the&s;e words at this time: For truly I think God would not have us &s;uffer &s;uch &s;o|lemn awful Providences as the&s;e to pa&s;s away without taking &s;pecial notice of them, and making &s;ome good improvement thereof.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, <HI>But what u&s;e &s;hall we make of this awful Providence?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;. <HI>It &s;hould cau&s;e us humbly to reflect upon our own vile natures.</HI> Have we been kept from the like Evils that others have been guilty of? no thanks to our own hearts, for we have the <HI>&s;ame</HI> nature that they have, and if God had given us up to our own hearts lu&s;ts, we &s;hould

have been as bad as they, or as any of the Children of men that ever were in the world.

One of the&s;e poor condemned Creatures that is here &s;tanding before the Lord this day, &s;aith that he thinks his pride has been his ruin: I asked him the other day in the Pri&s;on, what &s;in it was that he thought in his Con&s;cience God was provok'd with him for, &s;o as to leave him to that which has brought him under this Condemnation?

<P>And <HI>Idlene&s;s is a &s;in</HI> that doth bring many to a mi&s;erable end at la&s;t. It was one of tho&s;e &s;ins which cau&s;ed Thou&s;ands in <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Go|morrah</HI> to <HI>dye before their time</HI> in a dreadful manner.

<P>And <HI>Di&s;obedience to Parents</HI> is a &s;in that is oft|en puni&s;hed with <HI>untimely death.</HI> (as was part|ly intimated before) One of the&s;e that are to be executed this day, doth confe&s;s that his di&s;|obedience to his Parents has provok'd the Lord to bring this mi&s;ery upon him.

And now behold what all this Di&s;obedience hath brought him unto! All you <HI>di&s;obedient children</HI> that are here before the Lord this day, hearken to the word of the Lord, there is a Scripture

<P>A few Con&s;iderations and Directions let me &s;pread before you. Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That you have been wicked over much.</HI> The &s;in which you are now to die for is <HI>exceeding great,</HI> even <HI>Murther</HI>! the Scripture &s;ays that <HI>no murderer hath eternal life.</HI> And again, that <HI>Murderers &s;hall have their part in that lake which burns with fire &amp; brim&s;tone which is the &s;econd death.</HI> And no doubt you have bin guilty of many other grievous &s;ins, which have provoked the Lord to leave you unto the commi&s;&s;ion of this horrid <HI>murder.</HI> This <HI>murder</HI> al&s;o is exceedingly <HI>aggravated</HI> in re&s;pect of the <HI>per&s;on</HI> whom you have &s;lain, even <HI>your ma&s;ter</HI>! O how have you ri&s;en up in rebellion again&s;t the glorious Image of God, not only in that you have <HI>&s;hed the bloud of a man</HI> who was <HI>made after the I|mage of God,</HI> but <HI>&s;uch a man</HI> as had <HI>peculiar domi|nion over you,</HI> in that re&s;pect you have offered fearful violence to the &s;acred <HI>Image of the ble&s;&s;ed God.</HI> So that you have tran&s;gre&s;t the 5<HI>th</HI> and 6<HI>th Commandments</HI> at once in the highe&s;t degree that you could doe.
<PB N="34" REF="000394_0035_0FA5B7AF5CE1A958">
and &s;ince your <HI>apprehen&s;ion,</HI> yea <HI>conviction</HI> &amp; <HI>condemn|ation, you have told many lies</HI> (at lea&s;t one of you, it is to be fear'd both of you) <HI>again&s;t your con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider that <HI>now you mu&s;t die before your time.</HI> e&s;pecially one of you a poor <HI>young</HI> creature that has hardly liv'd 20 years in this world, and mu&s;t this day be turned out of it: yea both of you <HI>dye before your time.</HI> You might according to the or|dinary cour&s;e of nature have lived many a year. You mu&s;t be <HI>cut off</HI> by a violent and dreadful <HI>death.</HI> For indeed the anger of the Lord would fall upon this whole countrey where your &s;in has been committed, if you &s;hould be &s;uffered to live.</P>
<P N="3">3. Con&s;ider <HI>that there is yet a po&s;&s;ibility for you to e&s;cape the</HI> 2nd. <HI>death.</HI> Tho' your <HI>&s;in be very great,</HI> yet <HI>God can pardon it.</HI> I remember a pa&s;&s;age con|cerning a poor creature that was condemned to dye for wickedne&s;s he had been guilty of (I the rather mention it becau&s;e he was Countrey-man to one of you) but when he was in Pri&s;on gave good hopes of his unfeigned repentance, &amp; when he came to the place of execution, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Fulfilling of Scriptures, pag. <HI>233.</HI></NOTE> he had this expre&s;&s;ion <HI>O! God is a great forgiver, God is a great forgiver.</HI> So I &s;ay to you in his name <HI>the Lord is a great forgiver,</HI> it is His Name to <HI>forgive iniquity tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in.</HI> Yea and he hath (upon deep &amp; unfeigned repentance) forgiven <HI>tho&s;e</HI> that have committed <HI>this &s;in</HI> which <HI>you</HI> are now to <HI>&s;uffer</HI> for. <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> &s;hed much innocent blood, yet when he <HI>humbled him&s;elf greatly,</HI> the Lord was <HI>entreated for him.</HI> There are &s;ome in Heaven that were once

Know therefore, that there is Mercy en|ough with God to pardon &amp; &s;ave as great &s;inners as you are. And know that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t the &s;on of God, came to &s;ave the</HI> chief <HI>of &s;inners.</HI> There is merit &amp; righteou&s;ne&s;s enough in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>He was brui&s;ed for our iniquities,</HI> &amp; <HI>wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</HI> The wounds of Chri&s;t can make amends for <HI>tho&s;e wounds</HI> which you gave your Ma&s;ter, when you &s;lew him. The bloud of Chri&s;t can &s;atisfie for the bloud which you &s;hed, <HI>Je&s;us doth deliver from wrath to come.</HI> And he doth not exclude you from &s;alvation by him, if you do not by <HI>impenitency</HI> &amp; <HI>unbelief</HI> exclude your &s;elves. Nei|ther can the death you &s;uffer hinder the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls, inca&s;e you truly repent &amp; believe. Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath been made a cur&s;e, that &s;o he might <HI>redeem from the cur&s;e of the law.</HI> Yea He (the ble&s;&s;ed &s;on of God) was hanged upon a tree tho' he never knew any &s;in, only for the &s;ins of his people, &amp; therefore has &s;anctified <HI>all man|ner</HI> of Deaths unto tho&s;e y^t &s;hall believe on Him. Oh con&s;ider of it and let it break our hearts.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="36" REF="000394_0037_0FA5B7B281ADC388">4&punc; Con&s;ider. <HI>Pre&s;ently it will be too late for</HI> you <HI>to think of the&s;e things.</HI> when <HI>once</HI> you are <HI>dead,</HI> when once your &s;ouls are out of your bodies, it will be too late for <HI>you</HI> to think of the&s;e maters. There's no repenting in the Grave, no believing in <HI>Hell. Behold</HI> now <HI>is</HI> your <HI>accepted time, now is the hour of your &s;alvation,</HI> If you do not now accept of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t upon his own terms, you will be un|done and damn'd to all Eternity.</P>
<P>By way of <HI>Direction</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak 2 or 3 words.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Do what you can that God may have glory by you, that little time that you have to live.</HI> There|fore &s;ee that you &s;olemnly warn others, (e&s;peci|ally <HI>young ones</HI>) to take heed of tho&s;e evils which your con&s;ciences tell you have <HI>made way,</HI> for your de&s;truction. And &s;ee that you be &s;incere &amp; inge|nuous in making Confe&s;&s;ion of your &s;in. The Scripture &s;aith <HI>If we confe&s;s our &s;ins,</HI> i. e. with a penitent broken heart, de&s;irous never more to Commit them, <HI>God is faithful to forgive them</HI>&punc; And again, <HI>He that confe&s;&s;eth &amp; for&s;aketh &s;hall find mercy, but he that hideth his &s;in &s;hall not pro&s;per.</HI> I charge you in the Name of God, as you will an|&s;wer it by and by before his Judgement &s;eat, that you do not deny or di&s;own what you know is truth: &amp; <HI>I</HI> urge this the rather, becau&s;e you have not been &s;o ingenuous in confe&s;&s;ing your evil as God and men have expected from you. You ac|cu&s;e and impeach one another. The one of you &s;ays, that the other kill'd his Ma&s;ter, and you only &s;tood by and did not &s;trike one blow, and
<PB N="37" REF="000394_0038_0FA5B7B41FDAF010">
&s;o doth the other &s;ay; you accu&s;e him and he ac|cu&s;es you. But deceive not your &s;elves, if you deny what you know is truth, tho' God be mo&s;t merciful, yet God that made you will not have mercy on you, and tho' Chri&s;t be a Saviour for great &s;inners, He then will not &s;ave you. The de|vil has brought your bodies to ruin, and now his great de&s;ign is to de&s;troy your &s;ouls; He know|eth if he can per&s;wade you not to give glory to God by <HI>confe&s;&s;ing,</HI> he &s;hall have your &s;ouls for e|ver. I tell you truly if you now di&s;own the truth, when once your &s;ouls are out of your bodies, they &s;hall &s;uffer the Vengeance of Eternal fire.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Look up to God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he would give you Repentance</HI> &amp; <HI>Faith unfeigned.</HI> You cannot convert your &s;elves, but God can do it: therefore look up to him for that end, and cry mightily to him as for your lives. If the Magi&s;trate &s;hould &s;ay to you (they may not &s;ay &s;o, for then the di&s;plea&s;ure of God would come upon them &amp; up|on this people) that if you would cry earne&s;tly for your lives you &s;hould have them, O how ear|ne&s;t would you be? Behold the God of Gods &s;aith to you this day (and in his Name I proclaim it) that if you &s;eek unto him with all your hearts, it is po&s;&s;ible that the &s;entence of <HI>eternal</HI> death which is upon your &s;ouls may be revoked. Oh then pray for the lives of your &s;ouls. I remem|ber it is &s;toried of a poor woman that being con|demned to dye, as &s;oon as the &s;entence was pa&s;t, &s;he fell a crying and &s;hrieking in a lamentable

manner, the Judge rebuked her and bad her hold her peace, but &s;he replied <HI>O my Lord it is for my life, it is for my life.</HI> So I &s;ay to you, O cry to the Lord for Grace and pardoning Mercy, it is for the lives of your <HI>&s;ouls,</HI> yea it is for the lives of your <HI>Souls.</HI></P>
<P>And further to Awaken hereunto,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Think &s;adly of Eternity.</HI> O ETERNITY ETERNITY! It is an Amazing Meditation. There was a man that &s;aid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mentioned by Dr. <HI>Pre&s;t|on</HI> in his Ser|mons on <HI>the Attributes, Page.</HI> 165.</NOTE> <HI>If I were to endure the wrath of God for a Thou&s;and years only, methinks of could bear it; but when I think of ETERNITY I am Amazed.</HI> I Be&s;eech you think &s;eriou&s;ly of this. I might Charge you, and I do &s;o in the Name of God, but I al&s;o <HI>be&s;eech</HI> you, though you are poor, vile, Condemned Creatures, yet as I &s;aid to you in the Pri&s;on, &s;o I &s;ay in this &s;olemn Audience. <HI>I could be content to lye down at your feet, upon condition that I might be In&s;trumental of good to your &s;ouls.</HI> So greatly do I de&s;ire (God is witne&s;s) your Sal|vation; Therefore I pray you for the <HI>Lord's &s;ake,</HI> I pray you for your immortal <HI>Souls &s;ake,</HI> that you would by the&s;e things to heart, and we will once more cry unto the Lord that He would have Mercy and Compa&s;&s;ion upon tho&s;e precious and immortal &s;ouls of yours.</P>
