<P>And he &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord, remember me, when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom. And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, to day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE preceeding part of the chapter gives us the narration of the con|demnation and crucifixion of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour.&mdash;This was a glori|ous event to an apo&s;tate world; herein an effectual foundation was laid for the recovery of apo&s;tate man to the image and favour of God, and the bli&s;s and immortality for which he was at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd; howbeit his cru|cifiers meant not &s;o. I &s;hall omit taking notice of the many circum&s;tances here made mention of, that relate to our Lord's crucifixion, &s;ave only what is nece&s;&s;ary in order to place the words of our text in their proper point of light.</P>
<P>It appears then, from the Evangeli&s;t's account, that, agreable to what was &s;poken in prophe&s;y by I&s;aiah, chapter 53. la&s;t ver&s;e&mdash;he was in his death "numbered with the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors": For two malefactors, who were under &s;entence of death, adjudg'd to the painful and ignominious death of
<PB N="6" REF="010952_0004_0F85305090938BA8">
the cro&s;s, the &s;ame death that our Saviour was ad|judg'd to, were led away with him to the place of execution, and all three to be nailed to the cro&s;s and die together. "And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they cru|cified him, and the malefactors; one on the right hand, and the other on the left".</P>
<P>What a dreadful, di&s;tre&s;s'd &s;ituation was our ble&s;&s;ed Lord in at this time! But were there any relentings towards him in the men that &s;tood a|bout him? Any pity and compa&s;&s;ion &s;hewn to him? No, He was mocked and derided and in&s;ult|ed in the mo&s;t cruel and &s;hameful manner, by the people and the rulers at the head of them&mdash;as you may &s;ee ver. 35. and onwards. Notice is taken in the 40th ver. that one of the malefactors railed on him, in like manner, as others had done. But in Matthew and Mark, it is expre&s;ly &s;aid, that <HI>both</HI> of them did &s;o.&mdash;"The theives al&s;o which were cru|cified with him ca&s;t the &s;ame in his teeth", &s;ays <HI>Matthew,</HI> chap. 27.44. referring to what the &s;cribes and elders had in&s;olently demanded of him, that he would come down from the cro&s;s, &amp;c. In <HI>Mark</HI> it is, "<HI>They</HI> that were crucified with him, reviled him".</P>
<P>It is plain from what both the&s;e Evangeli&s;ts de|clare, that both the&s;e malefactors treated our Lord in the &s;ame manner, at the time of his crucifixion. The rea&s;on why the Evangeli&s;t Luke mentions only one of them, railing on him, was doubtle&s;s becau&s;e one of them cea&s;ed railing at him, before he ex|pired, a &s;udden and extraordinary change having
<PB N="7" REF="010952_0005_0F8530510E287B30">
pa&s;&s;ed upon him, &s;o that he had other apprehen|&s;ions of Chri&s;t from what he had when he came to the place and was fir&s;t fa&s;tned to the cro&s;s, and was very differently affected towards him. None of the other Evangeli&s;ts relate what Luke does re&s;pecting the&s;e things. One of the malefactors kept on rail|ing to the la&s;t: But the other, who had ju&s;t before joined with him, by a wonderful, divine influence upon his heart, &s;uddenly chang'd his note, thinks and &s;peaks in a very different &s;train.</P>
<P><Q>Here were &s;o many evidences given in a &s;hort time of a ble&s;&s;ed change wrought in him, as that more could not have been given in &s;o little a compa&s;s.</Q>
He that had ju&s;t before railed at Je&s;us, now admini&s;ters a &s;erious and pungent re|proof to his fellow&mdash;"Do&s;t not thou fear God, &s;ee|ing thou art in the &s;ame condemnation? And we indeed ju&s;tly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing ami&s;s".&mdash; What mu&s;t this rebuke be owing to, but the &s;ud|den and extraordinary change that pa&s;&s;ed over him? It &s;eems very plain from the Evangeli&s;t's account, that <HI>He,</HI> equally with his companion, was a &s;inner when he came to the place of execution. Both of them had lived in abominable practices, particu|larly in a cour&s;e of theft, &s;o that they had forfeited their lives into the hands of public ju&s;tice, and for the public &s;afety were condemned to die, to be drove out of the world, as not fit to live any longer in it, &s;uch pe&s;ts and nu&s;ances had they been to the community. And the day of execution comes, and both go to it, hardned and impenitent, having no fear of God in their hearts and before their eyes, pre|judic'd
<PB N="8" REF="010952_0006_0F8530576B5FAB10">
again&s;t Chri&s;t, who was to be crucified with them, and reviling and reproaching him. But one of them at the eleventh hour was wrought upon by the power of divine grace&mdash;as appears from what he &s;aid to his companion in iniquity and in &s;uffer|ing: And &s;o al&s;o from the prayer he addre&s;&s;ed to our Saviour in our text. "And he &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord remember me", &amp;c. And from the an&s;wer, that Je&s;us immediately gave to him, "Ve|rily I &s;ay unto thee, this day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e".</P>
<P><Q>This (as one notes) is the prayer of a dying &s;inner to a dying Saviour.&mdash;Perhaps he never prayed before, and yet now was heard and &s;aved at the la&s;t ga&s;p. While there is life, there is hope; and while there is hope, there is room for prayer.</Q></P>
<P>There are &s;everal things worthy our con&s;idera|tion, from this dying prayer of this malefactor, and our Saviour's an&s;wer to it. The&s;e I &s;hall but briefly &s;peak to, that I may leave more room for that which is the more e&s;pecial de&s;ign of our being a&s;&s;embled at this time, in this hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, up|on &s;o very melancholy and affecting an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Here then, we may, in the fir&s;t place, con&s;ider, wherefore it was that this dying criminal, who came to the place of execution in a &s;tate of &s;in and im|penitence, did, before he expired, addre&s;s this pray|er to Chri&s;t, "Lord remember me", &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now it mu&s;t needs be, that by his thus praying to Chri&s;t, he was brought truly to believe in him,
<PB N="9" REF="010952_0007_0F8530581F9FA848">
as the Son of God and the Saviour of &s;inners, and as able to &s;ave &s;uch a &s;inner as he was, though he had gone on even to the la&s;t, impenitent and at enmity with him. How can it be otherwi&s;e, than that he who had ju&s;t before been a railer, and became all at once a humble &s;uppliant, paying an act of re|ligious homage to Chri&s;t, and in a matter &s;o intere&s;t|ing to him&s;elf; how, I &s;ay, can it be otherwi&s;e, but that he &s;hould have &s;uch a faith as this, and in a lively exerci&s;e too? Had it not been for this, is it not likely that he would have gone on railing with his companion to the la&s;t, in&s;tead of rebuking him? It mu&s;t needs be that he had a very different view and apprehen&s;ion of Chri&s;t from what he ju&s;t be|fore had, and was differently affected towards him. It had been in&s;olently and tauntingly demanded of him, by the chief prie&s;ts, rulers, elders and people, that if he were the Son of God, he would come down from the cro&s;s, &s;ave him&s;elf from the death they were now putting him to, and &s;ave the two thieves al&s;o, and &s;o give proof of &s;uch his relation to God. They treated his claim to this relation with contempt, upbraiding him, that he was not able to come down from the cro&s;s, to deliver him&s;elf, or the thieves; and &s;o that it was a meer pretence that he was the Son of God, and the true Me&s;&s;iah, and "the thieves", both of them, "ca&s;t the &s;ame in his teeth". But he who offered the prayer to him in our text, was at the la&s;t brought to believe, that though he did not come down from the cro&s;s, as it had been demanded of him, but &s;ubmitted to the death of it, yet he was indeed what he had declared him&s;elf to be, the Son of God and the anointed Sa|viour; to &s;ee and believe the nece&s;&s;ity of his dying
<PB N="10" REF="010952_0008_0F853059A441D858">
this death, that &s;o he might to all intents and pur|po&s;es become the Saviour of &s;inners.</P>
<P>The death of Chri&s;t upon the cro&s;s is a main and principal article in the go&s;pel-&s;cheme of redemption. This is &s;poken of, e&s;pecially in the writings of the new-te&s;tament, as a &s;acrifice; a &s;acrifice of atone|ment. Divers things &s;poken by our Saviour him|&s;elf expre&s;s this, as might be particularly &s;hown; and the epi&s;tles of the Apo&s;tles are abundant in ex|pre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame thing, e&s;pecially the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews. The blood of Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented as "precious blood", incomparably more &s;o, than &s;uch "corruptible things as &s;ilver and gold", as that "through which we have redemption, even the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, according to the riches of God's grace". "It clean&s;eth from all &s;in". By the application of this blood, the mo&s;t heinous and aggravated &s;ins, tho&s;e that have been of a &s;carlet and crim&s;on colour, may be wa&s;hed away, and the guilty &s;inner become as white as the &s;now and as the wool. And what is it now that renders the blood of Chri&s;t &s;o efficacious? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e it is the blood of him, who though he took upon him the human nature, and in that nature died the death of the cro&s;s, yet was truly the Son of God; a higher character than his being the &s;on of man; denoting a &s;amene&s;s of nature with the Father.</P>
<P>Je&s;us, whom the Jews with wicked hands cruci|fied and &s;lew, was the "Lord of glory"; a cha|racter entirely incompatible with any finite nature whatever, though of the highe&s;t rank and dignity. Now the divine character of Chri&s;t, his being the
<PB N="11" REF="010952_0009_0F85305A251F6330">
Son of God, in a higher and more exalted &s;en&s;e, than &s;aints and angels, who are &s;ometimes &s;o called; this is that, which derives an infinite virtue and efficacy into his blood which he &s;hed upon the cro&s;s. So that it is ju&s;tly &s;aid of him, that he is "mighty to &s;ave", "able to &s;ave to the utter|mo&s;t", &amp;c.</P>
<P>So that the faith of the dying thief, re&s;pected Chri&s;t, (as was &s;aid before) as the Son of God and the anointed Saviour; and &s;o that the death he was now dying, was a &s;acrifice to put away &s;in, to make a compleat &s;atisfaction to the ju&s;tice of God for it; that he him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding his heinous wicked|ne&s;s, and abu&s;ive treatment of the &s;uffering Saviour, even until that time, might, through the virtue there|of, be pardoned, ju&s;tified and &s;aved; and his tru&s;t and dependance was firmly placed in him according|ly. And now &s;in, which he had been &s;o deeply guilty of before God, appears to him in its vilene&s;s and malignity. He is not exempted from the capital puni&s;hment he is adjudg'd to; the &s;entence of death pa&s;&s;ed upon him could not legally be rever&s;ed: But this is not the main thing with him, he is more affected with his wickedne&s;s which had brought him to this capital puni&s;hment; the vilene&s;s of which, principally as again&s;t God, is what he is now led to grieve and mourn for after a godly &s;ort. He was doubtle&s;s now in the exerci&s;e of a true repen|tance towards God, as well as faith unfeigned to|wards the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And &s;o from a vile, hardned &s;inner, he &s;uddenly became a ju&s;tified and &s;anctified man; and could with a humble confi|dence make the prayer to Chri&s;t that he did, that
<PB N="12" REF="010952_0010_0F85305AD3788328">
he would "remember him, when he came into his kingdom".</P>
<P>This &s;udden and happy change in him, ju&s;t be|fore he expir'd, contrary to all his inward enmity, hardne&s;s and prejudice again&s;t Chri&s;t, was (as was hinted before) effected in him by the gracious and powerful influences of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, which is the Spirit of the living God, to whom nothing is impo&s;&s;ible; who has an immediate acce&s;s to the &s;ouls of men, and contrary to all improbabilities, can in his adorable &s;overeignty work in them to will and to do of his own good plea&s;ure. This poor, dy|ing criminal, becoming at la&s;t a true penitent and a &s;ound believer, thereupon entertains a lively hope, that he &s;hould be happy in that invi&s;ible &s;tate into which he was now pa&s;&s;ing, and accordingly he makes the prayer of faith to Je&s;us&mdash;"Lord remember me", &amp;c.</P>
<P>And &s;o I go on in the next place, to con&s;ider the import of the prayer it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is plain from this prayer, that he believ'd that though Je&s;us was condemned and crucified as a malefactor, yet that he was the "Holy One of God", owned and accepted of his Father, and that when he expir'd he would a&s;cend to the heavenly king|dom. And he now fervently prays to him, that when he came there he would remember him, that he would admit him to be with him in that king|dom, admit him in his &s;pirit thereinto, when it &s;hould leave his body, as pre&s;ently it would do; much &s;uch a prayer as that of the excellent martyr Stephen to the exalted Je&s;us, whom he had an ami|able and happy vi&s;ion of, through the opened hea|vens&mdash;"Lord
<PB N="13" REF="010952_0011_0F85305B99F3A188">
Je&s;us receive my &s;pirit", Acts 7.59. He was fully convinc'd that his &s;oul would live after his body was dead, and that it would at once enter upon an invi&s;ible &s;tate. And the general purport of his prayer is&mdash;Lord, may my &s;oul be happy in that &s;tate, may it be admitted to the glories of thy kingdom, "remember me and prepare a place for me" when thou come&s;t into it. He does not go into any particulars, he &s;ums up all in this, "Lord remember me", &s;en&s;ible that if he did &s;o, it would be enough, that he &s;hould then be as happy as he could de&s;ire. But without enlarging here, I go on,</P>
<P>In the next place, to con&s;ider the gracious an&s;|wer of Je&s;us to this dying prayer of this poor criminal, "Verily I &s;ay unto thee, this day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e".</P>
<P>He &s;peaks here of heaven under the name of "paradi&s;e", and it is divers times thus &s;poken of in the new-te&s;tament, in allu&s;ion to the antient gar|den of God, that &s;eat of innocence, joy and felicity to our fir&s;t parents.</P>
<P>Our Lord had him&s;elf an undoubted pro&s;pect of his human &s;oul's a&s;cending immediately to the hea|venly paradi&s;e, &s;o &s;oon as it &s;hould leave his body.
<Q>That (as one notes) was the beginning of the joy that was &s;et before him:</Q>
And hence, "He en|dur'd the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame of it". The malefactor believed this of him: And accordingly he prays, Lord when thou arrive&s;t at paradi&s;e, re|member me.&mdash;The an&s;wer he gave was kind and gracious. He did not upbraid him with his pa&s;t heinous wickedne&s;s, and particularly with his abu&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="010952_0012_0F85305C84C509F0">
of him&s;elf in reviling him, as he had ju&s;t before done; did not tell him, no&mdash;I will reject you, as you de&s;erve; you &s;hall have no lot or portion in that ble&s;&s;ed place, where I am going&mdash;you &s;hall be a monument of my everla&s;ting wrath in the hell of the damned; but knowing his faith was genuine, and his repentance &s;incere, though late; he gives him a mo&s;t comfortable and reviving an&s;wer, "to day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e". He &s;peaks peremptorily in the ca&s;e, as that which he might certainly depend upon, "<HI>Verily,</HI> I &s;ay unto thee", &amp;c. "I the Amen, the faithful witne&s;s, &s;ay unto thee", &amp;c. "I &s;ay Amen to this prayer, put my <HI>fiat</HI> to it". It is ob&s;ervable here, that though our Lord was now dying the death of the cro&s;s "thro' weakne&s;s", yet he &s;peaks to this malefactor, as one having authority&mdash;I have power to grant your re|que&s;t, and you may depend upon it, that I will do &s;o. Your departing &s;pirit &s;hall immediately, even this day, be with me, where I am my &s;elf going, even in the paradi&s;e of God above. And &s;o this poor dying criminal, who had run a &s;ad race, ventur'd upon the very borders of eternal de&s;tructi|on, yet being at the la&s;t ca&s;t, vi&s;ited with the gra|cious and powerful influences of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, as was ob&s;erved before, had, from this an&s;wer to his prayer, even as his &s;uffering Saviour had, "a joy &s;et before him", a certain pro&s;pect of go|ing immediately to a &s;tate of compleat ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in the heaven of heavens. And this we may well &s;uppo&s;e, made him, as it were, in&s;en&s;ible to the ex|cruciating pains and tortures of his body, which was fa&s;tned to the ignominious, accur&s;ed tree, nor can he find it in his heart to a&s;k or wi&s;h to be taken
<PB N="15" REF="010952_0013_0F85305D192A1BB0">
down from it and di&s;charged; but his &s;oul mu&s;t rather earne&s;tly a&s;pire after and pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;h to go to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that glorious, exalted happi|ne&s;s, his Saviour had now promi&s;ed him, and that immediately, even that very day. This was infi|nitely more de&s;irable than to be di&s;charged from the cro&s;s, return to the world, be in a &s;tate of ea&s;e, credit and reputation among men, yea than to be put into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the &s;plendor and magnificence it can afford. To have the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t fulfilled to him, of going to be with him in paradi&s;e, this was by far the be&s;t of all. Nothing further is re|corded of him; but we may be well a&s;&s;ured, that this great and precious promi&s;e of Chri&s;t was verified to him&mdash;that that very day, he had a joyful, ble&s;&s;ed meeting with his Saviour in the heavenly paradi&s;e, that he met with a hearty welcome by him there|into, that he was congratulated upon his arrival by all the &s;hining ranks of angels and archangels, and filled with the highe&s;t prai&s;es and adorations for the rich and abundant grace of the crucified Je&s;us, in &s;natching him as a brand out of the burning, and rai&s;ing him to &s;o high honour, dignity and felici|ty, as to receive him to be with him and to fix him in tho&s;e heavenly man&s;ions, when he might have ju&s;tly left him in his impenitence and unbe|lief, and to &s;ink irrecoverably into the regions of eternal death and de&s;pair, as was the ca&s;e with his poor wicked companion, who, it is probable, kept on to the la&s;t ga&s;p, railing and reviling.</P>
<P>Thus I have, with all convenient brevity, con|&s;idered the mo&s;t material things in the dying prayer of the malefactor in our text, and our Lord's
<PB N="16" REF="010952_0014_0F85305DD96C3978">
an&s;wer to it.&mdash;I &s;hall now offer a few remarks briefly upon what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We may hence &s;ee, what it is that the heavenly happine&s;s, into which the &s;ouls of the faith|ful do immediately pa&s;s at death, eminently con&s;i&s;ts in, viz.&mdash;their going to be with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This we may gather from his an&s;wer to the dying prayer of the criminal&mdash;"This day thou &s;halt be with me", &amp;c. You &s;hall be ad|mitted to the heavenly paradi&s;e, to be with me there&mdash;that &s;hall be your happine&s;s, and that will be &s;ufficient. So it was in the e&s;timation of that eminent &s;ervant of Chri&s;t, the apo&s;tle Paul, "I de&s;ire to depart and be with Chri&s;t". Phil. 1.23.&mdash; Being with Chri&s;t is comprehen&s;ive of every thing great and good&mdash;a total freedom from all &s;in, &s;or|row, temptation; a being fixed in a &s;tate of un|di&s;turbed re&s;t and tranquility, rai&s;ed to a perfecti|on of holine&s;s and rejoicing with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory, in the clear &s;hinings of his countenance, and in the divine&s;t tokens and manife&s;tations of the love of this tran&s;cendant|ly amiable and excellent per&s;on: And all this to la&s;t through a boundle&s;s eternity. O what a &s;ublime and glorious happine&s;s is it for &s;ouls at death to go to be with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t! When they are ab&s;ent from the body, to go to be pre&s;ent with the Lord! Verily, in this ca&s;e, the day of death, let it come in what &s;hape or form it will, is better than the day of their birth, for it proves a &s;ure pa&s;&s;age to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible feli|city, as that of being with the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us is.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010952_0015_0F85305E8F94B560">Secondly, From the prayer of this criminal, and the an&s;wer of Chri&s;t to it, we may be led to re|mark, the divinity of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>The criminal had a further view of him, than the <HI>man</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us, bleeding and &s;uffering upon the cro&s;s; a view of him as the glorious Son of God&mdash;accordingly addre&s;&s;es a &s;ervent and mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting prayer to him, pays him divine homage.&mdash; The dying Saviour does not rebuke him for this, as offering &s;uch homage to a meer creature; but attends to it with &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure, gives a reviving an&s;wer, and lets him fully know and be a&s;&s;ured of it, that he had full power to grant him his petition and reque&s;t. But this would not have been, had he not a higher and more excellent na|ture, than meerly the human.</P>
<P>Thirdly, This in&s;tance of the dying criminal, his believing and repenting at the la&s;t, and being there|upon admitted to be with Chri&s;t in the heavenly paradi&s;e, is far from affording &s;ufficient grounds to &s;inners, to per&s;i&s;t in a cour&s;e of wickedne&s;s, pre|&s;uming upon it that at la&s;t they &s;hall truly repent, obtain an intere&s;t in the redemption by Chri&s;t, and on the whole, eternal &s;alvation in heaven.</P>
<P>It is certain, that tho&s;e who go on thoughtle&s;s and impenitent in wickedne&s;s, are daily provoking the divine maje&s;ty&mdash;trea&s;uring up wrath again&s;t the day of wrath: The wrath of God is &s;wiftly pur&s;uing them, and they are daily in danger of its overtaking them, and then they are irrecoverably lo&s;t and mi&s;erable. But if God &s;hould continue them in life even to old age, as they are daily affront|ing and di&s;honouring him, &s;o he may be provoked
<PB N="18" REF="010952_0016_0F85305F5682C970">
wholly to take his Holy Spirit from them, to give them up to hardne&s;s and blindne&s;s, to their own heart's lu&s;ts, and to walk in their own coun&s;els; and the event of all will be their "everla&s;ting de|&s;truction from God's pre&s;ence, and the glory of his power". For in this ca&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible, that they &s;hould ever be brought to true repentance towards God, and faith towards the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o finally obtain &s;alvation. So that if any take encouragement from this example of the dying malefactor, who&s;e ca&s;e we have been con&s;idering, to go on impenitent in &s;in, yea habitually allowing them&s;elves in any one known &s;in, pre&s;uming upon it, that all will be well with them at la&s;t, they run a de&s;perate venture, they are in the mo&s;t iminent danger of peri&s;hing eternally. Let all who have hitherto gone on impenitent in wickedne&s;s, &s;eriou&s;ly think of the&s;e things in time, and no longer harden them&s;elves again&s;t God. Let them attend to the call of God, to day while it is called to day, to re|pent and turn to him, that they may live and not die; let them fly to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that they may be clean&s;ed and purified, and made par|takers of his purcha&s;ed redemption.</P>
<P>Fourthly, From what we have heard of the ca&s;e of the dying malefactor in our text, we may learn, that it is a thing at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible, that impenitent &s;inners who have gone on &s;uch to the la&s;t, may be effectually brought home to God and Chri&s;t, and obtain eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Upon various accounts, the thing is very impro|bable, and what may not be pre&s;umed upon by any, as was ju&s;t &s;aid. However we &s;ee, from the example
<PB N="19" REF="010952_0017_0F8530600F0FB680">
we have been con&s;idering, that this has in fact been the ca&s;e: And what has been, may be again. For there is nothing impo&s;&s;ible with God, that does not imply in it, a repugnancy to his nature and ador|able perfections. Here we &s;ee a very &s;ignal di&s;play of the riches of divine grace to a poor hardned &s;in|ner, that had gone on in enmity again&s;t God and Chri&s;t, even to his dying hours. So that, though the circum&s;tances of this dying malefactor were different from tho&s;e of go&s;pel-impenitents now, as I might &s;how, would the time allow, yet, from what happened to him, thus much may be gathered, that impenitent &s;inners, even at the la&s;t, are not wholly excluded from hope. By the powerful and graci|ous influences of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, they may be brought, even at the la&s;t, to look to Je&s;us the Lamb of God, that takes away the &s;ins of the world; to look to him with an eye of faith, as the all-&s;ufficient Saviour, who&s;e precious blood has virtue &s;ufficient in it to clean&s;e from all &s;in; to look to him and mourn, and be in bitterne&s;s of &s;oul, and to commit the poor, peri&s;hing and departing &s;oul into his hands, per&s;uaded that he will keep what is com|mitted to him. Such may be the ca&s;e, I &s;ay. So that none, even in the near views of death and eter|nity, may totally de&s;pair of being &s;aved.
<Q>The dying thief upon the cro&s;s (as one &s;peaks) for|bids thee to de&s;pair utterly, though thou ha&s;t run a terrible ri&s;que, and ventured on the borders of de&s;truction; and if thou art &s;aved at la&s;t, it is &s;o as by fire, it is like a brand pluck'd out of the burning, or as a man e&s;caping naked out of the flames, and pa&s;&s;ing on the very brink of hell into everla&s;ting life.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010952_0018_0F8530610F50E218">This that I have now &s;aid, is e&s;pecially applicable to you, poor <HI>Arthur!</HI> a pri&s;oner of death, and this very day to be cut off by the &s;word of civil ju&s;tice! O what a gloomy, melancholy day is this, to &s;ee you in this unhappy &s;ituation! cut &s;hort in the prime of life! oblig'd to flee to the pit, and no man to &s;tay you! The &s;entence of death pa&s;&s;ed upon you cannot be recall'd!&mdash;The fatal tree is erected!&mdash;The officers of ju&s;tice &s;urround you! and all things are made ready to carry the &s;entence into execution! and before the &s;un clo&s;es upon us this evening you will launch into an awful eternity, and go to appear at the tremendous bar of God, to give up an account of your conduct in the body. And your eternal &s;tate will this very day be fix'd and unalterable! At the&s;e things doth not your heart tremble, and is it not moved out of its place? Death is an awful change at any time, and in any form, though to righteous ones a ble&s;&s;ed day, their glorious birth-day into immortal life; but a dreadful day to the wicked and ungodly: For they enter at once upon a &s;tate of endle&s;s mi|&s;eries and torments with the devil and his angels.&mdash; Methinks, it is impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould meet death, e&s;pecially in &s;uch an ignominious form, with carele&s;sne&s;s and indifference, but that your &s;oul mu&s;t be filled with anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s at the near pro&s;|pect of it, and at what will follow. But as terrible as the death before you may &s;eem to be, yet it is nothing to the &s;econd, the eternal death that will follow to the wicked and ungodly.&mdash;But now, this temporal death that you mu&s;t in a few hours die, may prove gain to you, and will do &s;o, if you are, as was the poor malefactor who &s;uffered with our

<P>Since now, there is a nece&s;&s;ity of your dying this day, O of what infinite importance is it to you, that you die in a &s;tate of favour with God, intere&s;ted in the merits of the all-&s;ufficient Redeemer, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord! And is it &s;o, that you are in|deed in &s;uch a happy &s;tate as this? If &s;o, you need not be afraid of dying, though a &s;hameful death. You may meet it with courage, becau&s;e it will prove a &s;ure pa&s;&s;age to the glorious pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t in paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>What I now &s;ay, is not with a de&s;ign to flatter you, as though your &s;tate God-ward was certainly good, and &s;o that you might be &s;ure of &s;alvation. I only propo&s;e this matter to your own heart and con&s;cience, whether that tells you, that the ca&s;e &s;tands thus with you, or the contrary? See now, what an&s;wers your con&s;cience makes to the que&s;tions I &s;hall propo&s;e to you.&mdash;</P>
<P>Have you been led to &s;ee what an infinite evil &s;in is, not meerly becau&s;e of the puni&s;hment temporal or eternal that follows upon it, but principally as it is again&s;t God? A vile di&s;honour and affront offer|ed to his glorious maje&s;ty, whom all rea&s;onable be|ings in all worlds ought to honour and obey? And as it is mo&s;t ba&s;e and &s;hameful ingratitude to him who made you, who has upheld you in life, and be&s;towed &s;o many mercies upon you, and who has given his dearly beloved Son to redeem you by his

precious blood? For in this con&s;i&s;ts the great evil of &s;in, viz. <HI>that it is again&s;t God.</HI> And have you a hearty grief and &s;orrow for it, mainly on this ac|count, penitently acknowledging to God with David, "again&s;t <HI>Thee, Thee</HI> only have I &s;inned"? P&s;al. 51.4. Does &s;in appear vile and odious to you for its own &s;ake? And what your &s;oul de&s;ires above every thing to be freed from? Have you &s;uch a thorough &s;en&s;e of the vilene&s;s of it, as that if you could be &s;et at liberty, and e&s;cape the capital puni&s;hment you are &s;entenc'd to, you could never find it in your heart any more to indulge your&s;elf in any one known &s;in? Have you good rea&s;on to think that you &s;hould no more return to fooli&s;hne&s;s; but that it would be the main bu&s;ine&s;s of your life to &s;erve and honour God? Attend carefully to the an&s;wers, your own con&s;cience gives to the&s;e que&s;tions.&mdash;</P>
<P>Again, Do you ju&s;tify man in the puni&s;hment you are &s;entenced to? Have you no ri&s;ings of heart, no ill-will to the honourable Court or the Jury, before whom you were tried, convicted and condemned? And as to the per&s;on that accu&s;ed you, that you do not harbour any malice towards her? And even &s;uppo&s;ing you think you was un|fairly and injuriou&s;ly treated in the matter, yet do you find a di&s;po&s;ition freely and heartily to forgive her?&mdash;Such a di&s;po&s;ition as this, however con|trary to corrupt nature, the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t makes ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, even in ca&s;es of the greate&s;t in|juries, as per&s;ons would hope to obtain forgivene&s;s of God them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Again, I would a&s;k you, what &s;en&s;e you have of your de&s;erts at the hands of God? Have you &s;uch

And are you truly &s;en&s;ible, that if you are &s;aved, it will be contrary to your de&s;erts, that it will be owing &s;olely to the free, rich, and &s;overeign mercy of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t?&mdash;Therefore do you &s;ee your need of Chri&s;t, that mercy can't be extended to you, but only for his &s;ake, who by &s;hedding his blood up|on the cro&s;s, has made a full &s;atisfaction to the ju&s;tice of God on the behalf of &s;inners, and opened an effec|tual way for their obtaining an acquittal from guilt, a free and full pardon at the hands of God, a recep|tion to his favour now, and to eternal life hereafter? Do you truly believe the record that God has given in his word, with re&s;pect to the blood of Chri&s;t, the incomparable preciou&s;ne&s;s of it, that it can clean&s;e from all &s;in, and particularly your &s;ins however nu|merous and heinous? and do you heartily tru&s;t in it accordingly?

<P>The&s;e are very &s;olemn and important que&s;tions.&mdash; O how happy mu&s;t it be, if you can an&s;wer them to the &s;atisfaction of your own heart, and can at the &s;ame time appeal, with a humble holy confidence, to that God, who is greater than the heart and know|eth all things!</P>
<P>But now, on the other hand, what a &s;ad thing is it, if you have not &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of things, and &s;uch

<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e the di&s;cour&s;e in a few words, briefly, to this numerous audience, come together upon this &s;ad and affecting occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>My Brethren! What a &s;ad and &s;orrowful &s;pecta|cle have we before us! One of our fellow-creatures, who&s;e &s;oul is as precious as ours, to be made an example of public ju&s;tice this day! Don't you pity, and compa&s;&s;ionate his unhappy ca&s;e? And don't you find it in your hearts, to lift up your fer|vent cries to God, that he would have mercy upon his immortal &s;oul that will pre&s;ently be required of him? Methinks there is none of you, but what mu&s;t find your bowels yearning towards him. That there are none here pre&s;ent, or in the great mul|titude a&s;&s;embled in this place, this day, that can find it in their hearts, upon &s;uch a melancholy oc|ca&s;ion, to give into any merriment and jollity. How very un&s;uitable, yea, how &s;hameful and &s;can|dalous would this be! unworthy their character as men, and e&s;pecially as chri&s;tians! In&s;tead of this, every one &s;hould be concerned to make a wi&s;e and good improvement of this di&s;pen&s;ation. Every one &s;hould take occa&s;ion to thank God that he has not been left to &s;uch heinous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, as would have

<P>Tho&s;e that have habitually indulged them&s;elves in &s;in and wickedne&s;s, &s;hould take warning by this example, that they do not go on any longer in it; le&s;t they be left to &s;uch high-handed commi&s;&s;ions, as to expo&s;e them&s;elves in like manner. They &s;hould be put upon earne&s;tly repenting and reforming, and devoting them&s;elves to God, through Chri&s;t, that &s;o they may be in favour with God and man.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that have the charge of youth, &s;hould be put upon the greate&s;t care, to train them up in the ways of God&mdash;frowning upon their vices, exerci&s;ing proper di&s;cipline towards them, when they give into any, re&s;training them as far as po&s;&s;ible, &s;etting vir|tuous, religious examples before them; by which means abundance of mi&s;chief may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, be prevented, and much good promoted.</P>
<P>None &s;hould pre&s;ume too much upon their own &s;trength&mdash;"Let him that &s;tandeth, take heed le&s;t he fall". All of us &s;hould live a life of humble depen|dance upon God, looking to him daily for his grace, which alone is &s;ufficient for us, to keep us back from pre&s;umptuous &s;ins and from &s;ecret faults&mdash;we &s;hould "watch and pray, le&s;t we enter into tempta|tion".</P>
<P>The &s;aints and people of God &s;hould prai&s;e him for his grace, by which they are what they are; pardoned, ju&s;tified, &s;anctified, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chri&s;t to the heavenly inheritance. Let them live by faith in the Son of God, be &s;trong in the grace that is in him, abound in every good word and work&mdash;continue faithful to the death, and with

joy and plea&s;ure and patience wait for their glorious advancement to the pre&s;ence and enjoyment of Chri&s;t in the heavenly paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Though the death of this poor criminal this day, is a violent, unnatural death, yet it &s;hould, however, put us all in mind of the great change of death that will pa&s;s upon us all, and it may be, as to &s;ome, &s;ooner, than they may be aware of. If then we are found ready, ble&s;&s;ed and happy are we, for a glorious life &amp; immortality will &s;ucceed. But if this great change &s;hould overtake us, in an impenitent, unpardoned, guilty, &s;inful &s;tate, it will be awful to us indeed, though the circum&s;tances of our death &s;hould not be with the ignominy of this day. Per&s;ons may de&s;cend into everla&s;ting burnings, though they &s;hould expire upon a bed of down, and every thing about them, be nice and delicate. In &s;hort, it is no matter where we die, or when, or after what manner, if our &s;ouls at death go to be with Chri&s;t in the heavenly paradi&s;e. &mdash; O let this be the main thing with us all, that when we quit this mortal life, as we mu&s;t all do; that our &s;ouls, our nobler and better part, may be convoyed by the angels of God, to the pre&s;ence of our exalted Redeemer in the paradi&s;e above. Our vile bodies, he will take care of, where ever depo&s;ited, and whatever changes may pa&s;s upon them, and re|compact them, and rai&s;e them up, beautiful and glo|rious, like to his own body, in the morning of the great day. And in our whole man he will invite us to the heavenly paradi&s;e to eat of the tree of life in the mid&s;t of it; rendring us eternally healthful, vi|gorous and active. God of his infinite mercy grant, that this may be the ca&s;e with us all, and that it
