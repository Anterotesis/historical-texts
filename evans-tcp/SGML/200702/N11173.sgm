<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have had twenty different accounts of your arrival at Bo&s;ton, which have been regularly contradicted the next morning; but as I now find it certain that you are arrived, I &s;hall not delay a &s;ingle in&s;tant addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to you. It is a duty I owe to the friend&s;hip I have long and &s;incerely profe&s;&s;ed for you; a friend&s;hip to which you have the &s;tronge&s;t claims from the fir&s;t moments of our acquaintance. There is no man from whom I have received &s;o many te&s;timonies of e&s;teem and affection, there is no man who&s;e e&s;teem and affection, could, in my opinion have done me greater honour. I entreat and conjure you therefore, my dear Sir, to impute the&s;e lines not to a petulant itch of &s;crib|bling, but to the mo&s;t unfeigned &s;olicitude for the future tranquility of your mind, and for your repu|tation. I &s;incerely lament the infatuation of the times, when men of &s;uch a &s;tamp as Mr. Burgoyne and Mr. Howe can be &s;educed into &s;o impious and ne|farious a &s;ervice by the artifice of a wicked and in&s;i|duous court and cabinet. You, Sir, mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e epithets are not unju&s;tly &s;evere. You have your&s;elf experienced the wickedne&s;s and treachery of this court and cabinet. You cannot but recollect their manoeuvres in your own &s;elect committee, and
<PB N="3" REF="014148_0003_0F935453E7A61DB0">
the treatment your&s;elf as Pre&s;ident received from the&s;e abandoned men. You cannot but recollect the black bu&s;ine&s;s of St. Vincents, by an oppo&s;ition to which you acquired the highe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;erved honour. I &s;hall not trouble you with my opinion of the right of taxing America without her own con|&s;ent, as I am afraid, from what I have &s;een of your &s;peeches, that you have already formed your creed upon this article; but I will boldly affirm, had this right been e&s;tabli&s;hed by a thou&s;and &s;tatutes, had America admitted it from time immemorial, it would be the duty of every good Engli&s;hman to exert his utmo&s;t to dive&s;t Parliament of this right, as it mu&s;t inevitably work the &s;ubver&s;ion of the whole empire. The malady under which the &s;tate labours is indi&s;putably derived from the inadequate repre&s;entation of the &s;ubject, and the va&s;t pecuniary influence of the crown. To add to this pecuniary influence and incompetency of repre&s;entation, is to in&s;ure and precipitate our de&s;truction. To wi&s;h any addition can &s;carcely enter the heart of a citizen who has the lea&s;t &s;park of public virtue, and who is at the &s;ame time capable of &s;eeing con&s;equences the mo&s;t immediate. I appeal, Sir, to your own con|&s;cience, to your experience and knowledge of our court and parliament; and I reque&s;t you to lay your hand upon your heart, and then an&s;wer with your u&s;ual integrity and frankne&s;s, whether, on the &s;up|po&s;ition America &s;hould be abject enough to &s;ubmit to the terms impo&s;ed, you think a &s;ingle Guinea rai&s;ed upon her would be applied to the purpo&s;e (as it is o&s;tentatiou&s;ly held out to deceive the people at home) of ea&s;ing the mother country? Or whether
<PB N="4" REF="014148_0004_0F9354549AB72068">
you are not convinced that the whole they could extract would be applied &s;olely to heap up &s;till fur|ther the enormous fund for corruption which the crown already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and of which a mo&s;t dia|bolical u&s;e is made. On the&s;e principles I &s;ay, Sir, every good Engli&s;hman, ab&s;tracted of all regard for America, mu&s;t oppo&s;e her being taxed by the Briti&s;h parliament; for my own part I am convinced that no argument (not totally abhorrent from the &s;pirit of liberty and the Briti&s;h con&s;titution) can be pro|duced in &s;upport of this right. But it would be im|pertinent to trouble you upon a &s;ubject which has been &s;o amply, and in my opinion &s;o fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. I find by a &s;peech given as your's in the public pa|pers, that it was by the King's po&s;itive command you embarked in this &s;ervice. I am &s;omewhat plea&s;ed that it is not an office of your own &s;eeking, tho', at the &s;ame time, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that it is very a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rming to every virtuous citizen, when he &s;ees men of &s;en&s;e and integrity, (becau&s;e of a certain pro|fe&s;&s;ion) lay it down as a rule implicitly to obey the mandates of a court be they ever &s;o flagitious. It fur|ni&s;hes, in my opinion, the be&s;t arguments for the total reduction of the army. But I am running into a tedious e&s;&s;ay, whereas I ought to confine my&s;elf to the main de&s;ign and purpo&s;e of this letter, which is to guard you and your colleagues from tho&s;e preju|dices which the &s;ame mi&s;creants, who have infatuated General Gage, and &s;till &s;urround him, will labour to in&s;til into you again&s;t a brave, loyal, and mo&s;t de|&s;erving people. The avenues of truth will be &s;hut up to you. I a&s;&s;ert, Sir, that even General Gage will deceive you as he has deceived him&s;elf; I do not
<PB N="5" REF="014148_0005_0F93545566075DE8">
&s;ay he will do it de&s;ignedly. I do not think him ca|pable; but his mind is &s;o totally poi&s;oned, and his under&s;tanding &s;o totally blinded by the &s;ociety of fools and knaves, that he no longer is capable of di&s;|cerning facts as manife&s;t as the noon day &s;un. I a&s;&s;ert Sir, that he is ignorant, that he has from the begin|ning been con&s;umately ignorant of the principles, temper di&s;po&s;ition, and force of the colonies. I a&s;&s;ert, Sir&punc; that his letters to the mini&s;try, at lea&s;t &s;uch as the public have &s;een, are one continued ti&s;&s;ue of mis|repre&s;entation, inju&s;tice, and tortured inferences from mis&s;tated facts. I affirm, Sir, that he has taken no pains to inform him&s;elf of the truth; that he has never conver&s;ed with a man who has had the cour|age or hone&s;ty to tell him the truth.</P>
<P>I am apprehen&s;ive that you and your colleagues may fall into the &s;ame trap, and it is the apprehen|&s;ion that you may be incon&s;iderately hurried by the vigour and activity you po&s;&s;e&s;s, into mea&s;ures which may be fatal to many innocent individuals, may hereafter wound your own feelings, and which can|not po&s;&s;ibly &s;erve the cau&s;e of tho&s;e who &s;ent you, that has prompted me to addre&s;s the&s;e lines to you. I mo&s;t devoutly wi&s;h, that your indu&s;try, valour and military talents, may be re&s;eved for a more honour|able and virtuous &s;ervice again&s;t the natural enemies of your country, (to whom our Court are &s;o ba&s;ely complacent) and not be wa&s;ted in ineffectual attempts to reduce to the wretchede&s;t &s;tate of &s;ervitude, the mo&s;t meritorious part of your fellow-&s;ubjects. I &s;ay Sir, that any attempts to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e mu&s;t be ineffectual. You cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ucceed. No man is better acquainted with the &s;tate of this
<PB N="6" REF="014148_0006_0F93545620812EA8">
continent than my&s;elf. I have ran through almo&s;t the whole Colonies, from the North to the South, and from the South to the North. I have conver&s;ed with all orders of men, from the fir&s;t e&s;tated gen|tlemen to the lowe&s;t planters and farmers, and can a&s;&s;ure you, that the &s;ame &s;pirit animates the whole. Not le&s;s than an hundred and fifty thou&s;and gentle|men, yeomen, and farmers, are now in arms, de|termined to pre&s;erve their liberties or peri&s;h As to the idea that the Americans are deficient in courage, it is too ridiculous and glaringly fal&s;e to de&s;erve a &s;erious refutation. I never could conceive upon what this notion was founded. I &s;erved &s;everal campaigns in America la&s;t war, and cannot recollect a &s;ingle in&s;tance of ill behaviour in the Provincials, where the Regulars acquitted them&s;elves well. In|deed we well remember &s;ome in&s;tances of the re|ver&s;e, particularly where the late Colonel Grant, (he who lately pledged him&s;elf for the general cowardice of America) ran away with a large body of his own regiment, and was &s;aved from de&s;truction by the valour of a few Virginians. Such prepo&s;terous arguments are only proper for the Rigby's and Sand|wich's, from who&s;e mouths never i&s;&s;ued, and to who&s;e brea&s;ts truth and decency are utter &s;trangers. You will much oblige me in communicating this letter to General Howe, to whom I could wi&s;h it &s;hould in &s;ome mea&s;ure addre&s;&s;ed, as well as to your|&s;elf. Mr. Howe is a man for whom I have ever had the hige&s;t love and reverence. I have honoured him for his own connections, but above all for his admirable talents and good qualities. I have courted his acquaintance and friend&s;hip, not only as a plea|&s;ure,
<PB N="7" REF="014148_0007_0F935456E65AD518">
but as an ornament; I flattered my&s;elf that I had obtained it Gracious God! is it po&s;&s;ible that Mr. Howe &s;hould be prevailed upon to accept of &s;uch an office! The brother of him, to who&s;e memory the much injured people of Bo&s;ton erected a monu|ment, &s;hould be employed as one of the in&s;truments of their de&s;truction! But the fa&s;hion of the times it &s;eems is &s;uch, as renders it impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould avoid it. The commands of our mo&s;t gra|cious Sovereign, are to cancel all moral obligations, to &s;anctify every action, even tho&s;e that the Satrap of an Ea&s;tern De&s;pot would &s;tart at. I &s;hall now beg leave to &s;ay a few words with re&s;pect to my&s;elf and the part I act. I was bred up from my infancy in the highe&s;t veneration for the liberties of man|kind in general. What I have &s;een of Courts and Princes convinces me, that power cannot be lodged in wor&s;e hands than in theirs; and of all Courts I am per&s;uaded that ours is the mo&s;t corrupt and ho&s;tile to the rights of humanity. I am convinced that a regular plan has been laid (indeed every act &s;ince the pre&s;ent acce&s;&s;ion, evinces it) to aboli&s;h even the &s;hadow of liberty from among&s;t us. It was not the demolition of the tea, it was not any other par|ticular act of the Bo&s;tonians, or of the other pro|vinces which con&s;tituted their crimes. But it is the noble &s;pirit of liberty manife&s;tly pervading the whole continent, which has rendered them the objects of mini&s;terial and royal vengeance. Had they been no|toriou&s;ly of another di&s;po&s;ition, had they been <HI>homines ad &s;ervitudinem paratos,</HI> they might have made as free with the property of the Ea&s;t-India company as the felonious North him&s;elf with im|punity.
<PB N="8" REF="014148_0008_0F935457AFD679A8">
But the Lords of St. James's and their mercenaries of St. Stephen's well know, that as long as the free &s;pirit of this great continent remains un|&s;ubdued, the progre&s;s they can make in their &s;cheme of univer&s;al de&s;poti&s;m, will be but trifling. Hence it is that they wage inexpiable war again&s;t America. In &s;hort, this is the la&s;t a&s;ylum of per&s;ecuted liberty. Here &s;hould the machinations and fury of her ene|mies prevail, that bright Godde&s;s mu&s;t fly off from the face of the earth, and leave not a trace behind. The&s;e, Sir, are my principles; this is my per&s;ua&s;ion, and con&s;equentially I am determined to act. I have now, Sir, only to entreat that whatever mea&s;ures you pur&s;ue, whether tho&s;e which your real friends (my&s;elf among&s;t them) would wi&s;h, or unfortunately tho&s;e which our accur&s;ed mi&s;rulers &s;hall dictate, you will &s;till believe me to be per&s;onally, with the great|e&s;t &s;incerity and affection,</P>
