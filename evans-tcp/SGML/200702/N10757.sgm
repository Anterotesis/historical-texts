<HEAD>TO THE IMPARTIAL PUBLICK.</HEAD>
<P>FULLY convinced of the Nece&s;&s;ity which exi&s;ts, that a &s;trict Union between the Head and Members of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire &s;hould take Place, no Per&s;on can harbour a &s;incerer Veneration for every Branch of it, or would more cordially rejoice in every Incident which had a Ten|dency to promote the Honour and Happine&s;s of the Whole. Problematical as this Language may ap|pear, in &s;uch as are di&s;po&s;ed to offer modern publick Opinions, I can with Truth aver, that it is in Con|formity to this Veneration, and that Conviction, I now attempt to expo&s;e the Imbecility of a Pamphlet &s;igned <HI>Freeman,</HI> which lately made its Appearance, and point out a few of the many Ab&s;urdities with which it teems.</P>
<P>Men, who, to humour unprovoked Re&s;entment on the one Hand, or to &s;erve unju&s;tifiable Purpo&s;es on the other, would invert the Order of Things, as well as the Grounds of e&s;tabli&s;hed Policy, &s;hould be deemed Enemies to Society; but when this Prin|ciple of Corruption is extended, and Per&s;ons of di&s;|tingui&s;hed Characters and upright Lives are &s;ingled

out as Objects for Envy and Di&s;appointment to wreck their Effects on, we may, without he&s;itat|ing, proceed a Step further and venture to pro|nounce &s;uch, the Author of Calomnies, and de&s;titute of every Species of honourable Feeling.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t freely confe&s;s my pre&s;ent Difficulty. In this little Pamphlet, I could wi&s;h to give &s;ome exact Portrait of <HI>Freeman,</HI> but am at a Lo&s;s in the Choice of Colours. Whether I &s;hould con&s;ider him as pa|triotick or mini&s;terial, heterodox, or orthodox, <HI>&s;implex vel unus, compo&s;itus vel idem,</HI> or both, or either, or neither, I cannot with Candour determine? But as it is not in the lea&s;t my Intention to cen&s;ure a Man who, in a per&s;onal Capacity, cannot much ob&s;truct the publick Good, I will only confine my&s;elf to &s;uch Arguments as tend to illu&s;trate the relative Con|nexion which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her Colonies.</P>
<P>I am well aware of the many Di&s;advantages which accompany an Attempt of this Nature. The be&s;t of Men are at Times liable to receive wrong Im|pre&s;&s;ions, under the Influence of which many are apt to con&s;ider Objects only in that Point of View which favours the natural Bias of the Mind. An Habit of thinking thus acquired is not readily era&s;ed; indeed with Time it collects a Strength in the Fancy frequently too &s;olid for the forcible Appearance of Rea&s;on or Argument to &s;ubdue. It is not to be then wondered that many Per&s;ons &s;hould be dazzled by tho&s;e fal&s;e Lights which are often di&s;played for &s;ini&s;ter Purpo&s;es, though in other Re&s;pects po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good Share of Under&s;tanding, as well as Integrity, Qualities which, in general, characterize <HI>Americans.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="013630_0004_0F9147F204805030">
As I &s;olemnly declare that I do not wear the Features of any Party, the impartial Publick may &s;afely rely on the Candour of &s;uch Rea&s;ons as will be u&s;ed in inve&s;tigating the Nature of that Right of Dominion which <HI>Great-Britain</HI> claims over the Co|lonies of <HI>North-America.</HI> It is the immediate In|heritance of every Man born free, to give his Opi|nion on publick Affairs with Truth; as an Indivi|dual I claim that Right. My Opinion, however, &s;hall be free, it mu&s;t; for certainly it will be the Language of my Heart, un&s;tudied, uncorrected.</P>
<P>The Sovereignty of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament over all the Dominions belonging to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is &s;o e&s;|&s;ential a Part of the Con&s;titution, that the Right cannot be renounced without a Confu&s;ion of Ideas, or a trea&s;onable Surrender. Notwith&s;tanding that internal Evidence which ari&s;es in the Mind of a thinking Man to &s;upport the Truth of this Maxim, from a Survey of tho&s;e Principles on which parlia|mentary Power is grounded, a Pamphlet, &s;igned <HI>Freeman,</HI> was publi&s;hed a few Days &s;ince, replete with the mo&s;t gro&s;s Strictures on the Conduct of his Maje&s;ty, his Mini&s;ters, his Parliament, with many others of his Maje&s;ty's Servants;&mdash;a Pamphlet, which, if accompanied with Grammar-Coherence, &s;ome Appearance of Decency, or &s;hew of Rea&s;oning, would evidently tend in its Con&s;equences to &s;ubvert the Con&s;titution, overturn a &s;ettled Sy&s;tem of &s;ub-ordination, and blot out that Ear-mark by which legal Dominion is di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Arguments advanced by <HI>Freeman</HI> to &s;u&s;tain Po&s;itions in direct Contradiction to the inherent Rights of a State, are as incongruous as the Po&s;itions
<PB N="4" REF="013630_0005_0F9147F51056C8F8">
them&s;elves are ab&s;urd. Since the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment of Mankind into &s;eparate Societies, there was a &s;u|preme Power centered in &s;ome Part of the State or Society, for the Purpo&s;e of forming nece&s;&s;ary Regu|lations for the Good of the Whole. It was ju&s;tly pre&s;umed, that &s;uch Regulations, though e&s;&s;ential for the Pre&s;ervation of the Society, would not prove equally agreeable to each Individual, who might be left at Liberty to judge them a heavy Re&s;traint on the Laws of Nature, there was a coercive Power, <HI>ex nece&s;&s;itate,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed, which enjoined an impli|cit Obedience to &s;uch Laws as the Wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lative Body judged proper to enact. The un|equal Dictates of natural Law being thus wi&s;ely re|&s;trained, for the general Benefit of the Community, and reduced to a &s;ubordinate Limitation, no Argu|ments, on the &s;uppo&s;ed Impropriety of &s;uch Mea|&s;ures as were adopted by the acknowledged legi&s;lative Power could be admitted, being in their Nature op|po&s;ed to tho&s;e Principles on which the con&s;titutional Power of the State or Society was founded.</P>
<P>On this Ground I will meet <HI>Freeman'</HI>s Opinion, and demon&s;trate its Incoherency: That Gentleman may, if he plea&s;es, u&s;e the Dialect of metaphy&s;ical Jargon, I will confine my&s;elf to tho&s;e plain Rea&s;ons which ari&s;e from a Contemplation of that con&s;titu|tional Authority which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Great-Bri|tain.</HI> His Opinion might po&s;&s;ibly carry &s;ome Weight in <HI>Foro Coeli,</HI> but I &s;trenuou&s;ly deny that a Retro&s;pect to the fir&s;t Principles of our Con&s;titution will render his Plea in Behalf of <HI>American</HI> Indepen|dence admi&s;&s;ible at the Bar of an earthly Tribunal, guided by Wi&s;dom or &s;ound Policy. The Colonies

were peopled and planted by <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects; at their Departure for <HI>America,</HI> they brought with them their Allegiance, an indelible Mark of their Sub|jection to a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament; a Token of Obedi|ence derived from their Ance&s;tors, who were coeval with the Origin of the State, which no Change of Climate, no after-Act of theirs, could era&s;e from their Per&s;ons. Thus circum&s;tanced, the fir&s;t Emi|grants reached the we&s;tern Continent, which had been previou&s;ly declared to be &s;ubjected to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> State by the Di&s;coverers thereof, agreeable to their Principles of Duty and Allegiance. The Pro|prietor&s;hip of tho&s;e new Territories was granted by the executive Magi&s;trate to the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Company, with Intent of promoting their Colonization; an Ability of forming &s;uch municipal Regulations for their Government, as were con&s;i&s;tent with the re|lative Tie of Subjection they were under to the State, was al&s;o confirmed to the Company. They regu|larly exerci&s;ed their Right of Power until their Pri|viledge cea&s;ed&punc; Whatever local Regulations were made, were in&s;tituted in <HI>England.</HI> In like Manner the other Provinces of <HI>America</HI> were granted to different Per&s;ons, with Power of &s;upreme Juri&s;dic|tion, though &s;ub&s;ervient to the Controul of Parlia|ment: And no later than 1732, half a Dozen <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Gentlemen regularly a&s;&s;embled at a Tavern in <HI>London,</HI> and there framed Laws for the Province of <HI>Georgia,</HI> for the Purpo&s;e of collecting a Revenue, &amp;c. without the &s;malle&s;t Altercation held by the Inhabi|tants of that Province, concerning the Right of their Proprietors &s;o to do. It mu&s;t have required a won|derful Acce&s;&s;ion of Knowledge &s;ince the above Pe|riod,
<PB N="6" REF="013630_0007_0F9147F6F5905760">
to di&s;cover; that a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, a&s;&s;embled in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> cannot legally a&s;&s;ume a Power which, when ve&s;ted in Five or Six <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Gentle|men, enjoying them&s;elves over a Bottle at the <HI>Crown-and-Anchor,</HI> they held &s;acred, and with a placid Compo&s;ure &s;ubmitted to.</P>
<P><HI>America</HI> is not a Part of the King's hereditary E|&s;tates; it con&s;titutes a Share of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Empire. The Dominion of the King in <HI>America</HI> ari&s;es from Parliament, which hath appointed him &s;upreme Governor over all the Dominions of the State; and here I cannot &s;ufficiently admire the Sophi&s;try of Per&s;ons who affect Obedience to a Magi&s;trate, and renounce at the &s;ame Time Subjection to that para|mount Authority from which the Magi&s;trate derives his Power. It is a unlucky Circum&s;tance, that Partizans for that Doctrine of Independence lately broached by <HI>Freeman,</HI> under a new political Phiz, cannot avoid the &s;ad Alternative of either maintain|ing, that they are not Subjects to the King of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> or, if that be granted, of confe&s;&s;ing their De|pendence on a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, to the con&s;tituted chief Magi&s;trate of which they humbly conde&s;cend to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>Parliament, fore&s;eeing that the Crown might claim an exclu&s;ive Dominion over the Colonies, took an early Opportunity of a&s;&s;erting its Right. This Precaution in Parliament was very nece&s;&s;ary. We find, that on a Complaint exhibited by the <HI>New|England,</HI> Settlers to King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t, again&s;t tho&s;e who, under the Countenance of Parliament, carried on a Fi&s;hery on the Coa&s;ts, that many Out|rages had been committed by Per&s;ons employed in
<PB N="7" REF="013630_0008_0F9147F7E2DB89C8">
that Bu&s;ine&s;s, on their Per&s;ons and Property, by cutting down Wood in their Enclo&s;ures, &amp;c. <HI>James</HI> was glad of this Pretext, thinking it would furni&s;h him with a proper Excu&s;e for u&s;urping a &s;ole and exclu&s;ive Right of Power. He therefore i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation, not only for the Purpo&s;e of redre&s;&s;ing Grievances complained of by the infant Settlers, but plainly importing the Idea of ab&s;olute Dominion, which in his regal Capacity he claimed. The <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Senate now judged it high Time to interpo&s;e, and curb this gigantick Stride of Prerogative. The Affair being introduced into Parliament, <HI>James</HI> &s;ent his Secretary with a Me&s;&s;age de&s;iring they may de|&s;i&s;t, as having no Authority over the Colonies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commons Journal, 1622.</NOTE>; but Parliament &s;en&s;ible of its Right, was not to be inti|midated &s;o far as to neglect a Matter of &s;uch Im|portance to the State, it re&s;umed the Debates on that Subject, and expedited a Bill clearly thwarting the A&s;&s;ertions contained in the Royal Proclamation. Though this Bill mi&s;carried in the Upper Hou&s;e, through the Machinations of the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham,</HI> the Unanimity with which it pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons, (there being only two di&s;&s;enting Voices<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The King's Secretary, and Mr. G&mdash;.</NOTE>) will remain a la&s;ting Monument how con&s;cious the Nation was of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a paramount Right over all the new Settlements and Territories acquired conquered or colonized, by its Subjects.</P>
<P>Parliament could not conde&s;cend to &s;urrender into the Hands of the Crown a Right of &s;o weighty a Concern. We accordingly find this Bu&s;ine&s;s taken up the Year following, in the Hou&s;e of Commons,
<PB N="8" REF="013630_0009_0F9147F8935B9CB8">
and pur&s;ued with &s;uch Ardency<NOTE N="Dagger" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Sackville's Speech, Com. Jour. 18th Feb. 1623.</NOTE>, that the King's Secretary gave up the Point. The &s;upreme Juri&s;|diction of Parliament over the Colonies being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed and acknowledged, by a Prince flu&s;hed with Ideas of divine Right, it cannot be doubted, that if its Competency was di&s;puted, of exerci&s;ing plenary Dominion over other Colonies, as well as <HI>New-Plymouth,</HI> it would have &s;tept forth with the &s;ame Zeal, and incontrovertibly have determined its Right. Thus we &s;ee, that notwith&s;tanding the O|pinions Individuals now adays adopt, the Language of Parliament continues the &s;ame, with only this Difference, that the Struggle in the Reign of <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t was with the Crown, which attempted to ou&s;t it of its &s;upreme Juri&s;diction, and that in the Reign of <HI>George</HI> the Third was with the Colonies, which contended for a Latitude of Independence in|con&s;i&s;tent with every Idea of Subordination.</P>
<P>There is not the lea&s;t Similitude between the two Periods of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t and <HI>George</HI> the Third; nor would any Per&s;on draw the Portrait who had the &s;malle&s;t Particle of Re&s;pect for his Sovereign. Unhappy <HI>Charles</HI> became Heir to his Father's Follies as well as his Crown; taught from his Infancy to con&s;ider Parliaments as formal Expletives in the State, he judged them unnece&s;&s;ary when once they had cea&s;ed to echo the Will of the Sovereign, and de|termined to rule without them. In con&s;equence of this fatal Re&s;olution, arbitrary Exertions of the Pre|rogative grew into U&s;e. Tho&s;e were the Ills from which the Troubles of that Reign &s;prung. The Hou&s;e of Commons could no longer endure the con|tinual
<PB N="9" REF="013630_0010_0F9147F934F8D638">
Attacks which were made on its Privileges: It therefore, (not the People, as <HI>Freeman</HI> ob&s;erves) aro&s;e in its Might, and e&s;tabli&s;hed its undoubted Right. This was not a Conte&s;t between the Prince and a particular Body of his Subjects; it was &s;trictly a Ca&s;e in which the Sovereign was Plaintiff and Par|liament Defendant: The Claim of the Crown was ab&s;olute and &s;ole Dominion: Parliament demurred; and &s;ince no other Court of Judicature could deter|mine this important Cau&s;e, the Appeal, from Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, lay to the God of Ho&s;ts. What a &s;oul and ungenerous Mi&s;repre&s;entation! to combine the Events of two Princes Reigns, and a&s;&s;imilate them, where there is not the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parity to ju&s;tify the Ob&s;ervation; the one having u&s;urped the Authority of Parliament, and &s;ub&s;tituted his will for Law; the other &s;o tender of the Rights of this People, as not to proceed in the &s;malle&s;t Affairs without collecting the Sen&s;e of his Senate.</P>
<P>I will now con&s;ider the Weight of tho&s;e Rea&s;ons which <HI>Freeman</HI> urges, to exempt <HI>America</HI> from Taxation by a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>That the <HI>Americans</HI> being de&s;cended from the &s;ame Ance&s;tors with the People of <HI>England,</HI> and owing Fealty to the &s;ame Crown, are there|fore equally with them entitled to the common Law of <HI>England,</HI> formed by their common An|ce&s;tors; and to all and &s;ingular the Benefits, Rights, Liberties and Claims, &s;pecified in <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> in the Petition of Rights, in the Bill of Rights, and in the Act of Settlement. They being no more than principally declaratory of the Grounds of the fundamental Laws of <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="013630_0011_0F9147F9F9C38578">
<Q>Therefore, that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament ought not to have, and cannot of Right po&s;&s;e&s;s any Power to tax, or in any Shape to bind <HI>American</HI> Freeholders of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown, &s;eeing it is a|gain&s;t the Franchi&s;es of the Land, becau&s;e their Con&s;ent is not &s;ignified in Parliament, by a Re|pre&s;entation of their own Election.</Q> The other principal Objection is, I think, the <HI>adjudged Ca&s;e in Point of</HI> Durham.</P>
<P>Having already admitted the <HI>Americans (though not de&s;cended from the &s;ame Ance&s;tors with the People of</HI> England, being a Compound of <HI>Engli&s;h, Scots, Iri&s;h, French, Dutch,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>New-York</HI> in particular, was a <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlement until the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and was &s;ubject to the States of Holland, which gave Law and collected a Revenue therein) to be entitled to &s;uch Rights as <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> legally &s;hould enjoy, I cannot &s;ee a &s;ingle Inference that ari&s;es from the Conce&s;&s;ion, to ju&s;tify <HI>Americans</HI> in withdrawing an Obedience to &s;uch Laws as the Wi&s;|dom of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> State judges convenient to enact. It is the heavy Mi&s;fortune of <HI>Freeman,</HI> to quote Ca&s;es which, if properly con&s;idered, overthrow the Prin|ciples he would wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h. I mu&s;t confe&s;s his Ca&s;e is de&s;perate; having impatiently &s;olicited the Touch of Corruption for long Series of Years, and meeting with only contemptuous Repul&s;es, a lament|able Circum&s;tance, which, when coupled with a total and merited Di&s;regard of his Countrymen, and an entire Shipwreck of private Fortune, in the Re|duction of which, alas! the Nicks of <HI>Seven</HI> and <HI>Eleven</HI> bore no incon&s;iderable Share. I &s;ay, to re|medy tho&s;e Calamities. Prudence mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily

<P>The fir&s;t Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by the Author of the Letter to the general Congre&s;s, is &s;o unguardedly couched that it may be retorted, I fear, with too much Succe&s;s. <HI>Exempli gratia;</HI> the <HI>Americans</HI> are formed of different People, <HI>Dutch, French, Swedes, Germans, Scots, Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Each Individual brought with him tho&s;e unalien|able Rights which were his Inheritance in the Country from whence he emigrated.</P>
<P>Therefore each of tho&s;e Per&s;ons is entitled to all and &s;ingular the Rights, Privileges and Benefits, which they legally could enjoy in their &s;everal Countries from which they extracted their Origin.</P>
<P>To prevent, however, the Ab&s;urdity and Confu|&s;ion which take birth from the Jumble of Matter contained in the fir&s;t Po&s;ition of <HI>Freeman'</HI>s Letter, I have taken Care to &s;ecure, by legal Demon&s;tration, to the <HI>Americans</HI> the Rights of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> in a former Part of this &s;hort Treati&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Magna Charta</HI> comes next in Order, which is <HI>"&s;uch a Fellow that he will have no Sovereign."</HI> If
<PB N="12" REF="013630_0013_0F9147FC5566D608">
he is "&s;uch a Fellow," he mu&s;t be formidable in|deed; but that he is "no &s;uch Fellow," will, I think, inconte&s;tibly appear.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and principal Care of the Barons who obtained that memorable Charter, was to &s;ecure the Roman Catholick Religion: Their &s;econd Precau|tion was to lop off the luxuriant Branches of <HI>Norman</HI> Hard&s;hips. That which was granted to the Barons at <HI>Runnemede,</HI> and which <HI>Freeman</HI> hath &s;o highly extolled, I account of little Weight, and this for two Rea&s;ons; the fir&s;t, as not &s;ufficient for redre&s;&s;ing the Oppre&s;&s;ions which the People then groaned under; the &s;econd, becau&s;e the Acqui&s;ition of the Charter did not carry a legal Complexion, being obtained from a Prince in Dure&s;s. But that Charter of Im|munities, which was confirmed by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third to his Barons, with Amendments in Favour of the Subject, which is properly &s;tiled <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> may de&s;erve the Eulogium of <HI>Freeman.</HI> I will now clearly demon&s;trate, that <HI>Magna Charta</HI> hath been, and &s;till is, &s;ubject to the Controul of Parliament; fir&s;t, in the Article of Religion, which is totally changed from that Form which the Barons contend|ed for in Blood, and indeed e&s;tabli&s;hed. Here mark. This Alteration in Religion was adopted by Parlia|ment, which did not pre&s;ume <HI>Magna Charta</HI> to be a "Fellow &s;uperior" to <HI>its</HI> enacting Power.</P>
<P>The &s;econd In&s;tance of doing away the Sub&s;tance of the great Charter is evident from every day's Practice. Whereas the twenty-ninth Chapter of <HI>Magna Charta</HI> expre&s;&s;es, that no free Man &s;hall be di&s;&s;eized of his Lands or Tenements, or bani&s;hed, or impri&s;oned, unle&s;s by the Judgment of his Peers;

The &s;upreme Authority of Parliament, not only over all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions, but al&s;o over the Crown, was rendered manife&s;t at this memorable Period; and the Subjection of the Colonies to Parliament cannot be more &s;trongly featured than in that Re&s;olve of the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Virginia,</HI> which unanimou&s;ly agreed, That if <Q>the Parliament had con&s;tituted the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> King, <HI>we, who are &s;ubject to Parliament, mu&s;t acknowledge him likewi&s;e.</HI></Q> The fifth Po&s;ition now only remains to be con&s;idered, which is the <HI>Act of Settlement;</HI> an Act equally fatal to the De&s;igns <HI>Freeman</HI> would wi&s;h to inculcate as any of the preceding.</P>

They formed a Colony at the Mouth of <HI>Hud&s;on's</HI> River, which they named <HI>New-Am&s;terdam</HI> (now <HI>New-York</HI>) and the Country adjoining was called <HI>New-Netherland.</HI> They extended tho&s;e Settlements as far as Fort <HI>Orange</HI> (now Forty <HI>Abany</HI>) which is a Di&s;tance of forty Leagues up the River.

How tho&s;e two only Monuments of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Freedom &s;hould e&s;cape the Notice of the learned Author of the Letter to the Delegates is inconceive|able to me: But, when we &s;ee a String of Laws appealed to, Laws, which, on a proper Information of their Tendency, incontrovertibly damn tha A&s;|&s;ertions of the Appealer, can we po&s;&s;ibly prevent that ri&s;ible <HI>Ton</HI> which every Mu&s;cle of the Face will naturally a&s;&s;ume?</P>
<P>Seeing, therefore, that the various Arguments de|duced to limit the taxing Attribute of Parliament have not only failed, but fatally operated to demon|&s;trate its perfect Ability, I will now con&s;ider the Principles of feodal Power, on which the Sovereignty of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> State is founded. <Q>Shall an original Sovereignty, long annihilated in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crown by common Law, now be permitted to revive by a Fiction, to de&s;troy original Rights, expre&s;sly, and often a&s;certained by the Forefathers of the <HI>Americans,</HI> and admitted as often by the Kings of

It may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that Ideas of <HI>feodal Sovereignty were actually &s;upported by the common Law,</HI> "not annihilated," as <HI>Freeman</HI> a&s;&s;erts; and in all Ca&s;es where the Terrors of this lordly Do|minion, are now &s;u&s;pended; with Thankfulne&s;s we mu&s;t attribute it to the Wi&s;dom of that Parlia|ment

It is not to be here under&s;tood, that the 12th of <HI>Char.</HI> II. had any farther Tendency than to remove the arbitrary Re&s;traint under which the Subject's Property was held, from illegal Stretches of feodal Principles.

<P>But, before I enter into the&s;e Con&s;iderations, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a Review of the &s;uperiour Courts of Judicature, e&s;tabli&s;hed for the Benefit of the Community, and for the Support of our glorious and excellent Con&s;titution, together with the indi&s;|pen&s;ible Duty of Ju&s;tices appointed by the Royal Order to pre&s;ide in each.</P>
<P>The&s;e Courts are divided in two Parts, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Law and Equity: Judges in the former are &s;worn, in their Di&s;pen&s;ation of Ju&s;tice, to be guided by the Com|mon and Statute Law of the Realm. Any wilful Appeal to private Opinion, in their &s;olemn Deter|minations, where there is a Record which atte&s;ts, or an Act that declares, how the Law in the particular Ca&s;e &s;tands, is a criminal Deviation from their Duty, and a flagrant Breach of Oath, for which they are liable to be pro&s;ecuted, and mo&s;t &s;everely puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>However, lea&s;t a rigorous Determination of a Court of Law &s;hould affect the Subject in Ca&s;es wherein he lay expo&s;ed to the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Law; and, as it was <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for him to obtain Redre&s;s from <HI>Judge&s; &s;worn</HI> to act <HI>according to Law;</HI> a Court

of Equity was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and endued with Powers to mitigate the Rigour of &s;uch Deci&s;ions as appeared not con&s;i&s;tent with equitable Principles of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>This &s;hort Review of the Duty of Judges being ended, I am now left at Liberty to con&s;ider the Propriety of the Conduct of that <HI>"Set"</HI> of Judges which unanimou&s;ly agreed that Writs of A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The Attorney-General moved the Court of Com|mon-Pleas in <HI>February</HI> Term 1773, for a Writ of this Nature. A Gentleman who took Notes on that Day, hath done me to Favour of communicating to me the Sub&s;tance of the Chief Ju&s;tice's Argument; I will beg leave to in&s;ert it here.</P>
<P>"Tolls or Duties upon Merchandi&s;es, now called Cu&s;toms, have been long payable to his Maje&s;ty's Predece&s;&s;ors, Kings and Queens of <HI>England;</HI> &s;o long as to induce many to believe that they were the In|heritance of the King by immemorial U&s;age or com|mon Law. But my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> in his 2d <HI>In&s;titute,</HI> Page 58, in his Expo&s;ition of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> clearly demon&s;trates, that the&s;e Cu&s;toms derived their Au|thority under the Sanction of an Act of Parliament, and were not allowable by common Law; but were fir&s;t granted to the Crown, by the Statute of <HI>We&s;t.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t, in the Reign of <HI>Edw.</HI> I. &s;o that by this we &s;ee King's Rights to Cu&s;toms e&s;tabli&s;hed by Autho|rity of Parliament almo&s;t 500 Years &s;ince; and they now con&s;titute a Part of the King's extraordinary Revenue. At fir&s;t they were granted for only &s;tated Terms of Years; and afterwards to the different Kings for Life, by different Acts of Parliament. I
<PB N="28" REF="013630_0029_0F91480BF7BDAF10">
&s;hall, however, go no farther back than the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> II. when the Act of Tonnage and Pound|age pa&s;&s;ed, among the fir&s;t Laws made after the Re&s;toration&mdash;in the 12th of <HI>Char.</HI> II. Cap. 4. By that Act a Sub&s;idy of Tonnage and Poundage was given to his Maje&s;ty for Life, and the Rates of Merchandi&s;e were &s;ettled, as they were then agreed upon, by the Commons in Parliament, and &s;igned by their Speaker.</P>
<P>"The &s;ame Duties were afterwards granted for Life to <HI>Jac.</HI> II. and <HI>W.</HI> III. And by three different Acts of Parliament made &s;ince, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> 9th <HI>Anne,</HI> Cap. 6, the 1&s;t <HI>Geo.</HI> I. Cap. 12, and the 3d <HI>Geo.</HI> I Cap. 7, they are made perpetual; &s;o that the King's Right thereto appears to be clear and indi&s;putable, under the &s;everal Acts of Parliament mentioned."</P>
<P>"Immediately after the Act of Tonnage and Poundage had pa&s;&s;ed, it became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure to the King the Payment of the parliamentary Re|venue granted him by that Act, and to prevent him of being defrauded thereof.</P>
<P>"And accordingly, by the 12th of the &s;ame King, Cap. 19, it was enacted, That where Goods liable to Cu&s;toms, Sub&s;idy, or other Duties, by the Act of Tonnage and Poundage, &s;hall be conveyed away without Entry or Agreement for the Cu&s;toms; that on Oath thereof before the Lord Trea&s;urer, or any of the Barons of the Exchequer, or the chief Magi&s;trate of the Port or Place where the Offence was committed, or of the Place next adjoining there|to, it &s;hall be lawful for the Lord Trea&s;urer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to i&s;&s;ue Warrants to any Per&s;on, or Per&s;ons, enabling him or them, with A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Sheriff, Ju&s;tice
<PB N="29" REF="013630_0030_0F91480CD76CDB50">
of Peace, or Con&s;table, to enter <HI>any</HI> Hou&s;e by <HI>Day,</HI> where &s;uch Goods are <HI>&s;u&s;pected</HI> to be concealed; and in ca&s;e of Re&s;i&s;tance, to break open &s;uch Hou&s;es and &s;eize, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all Officers and Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice are required to be aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting thereto.&mdash;No Hou&s;e to be entered except within a Month after the Offence is committed; and Damages may be re|covered again&s;t a fal&s;e Informer.</P>
<P>"The Remedy provided by this la&s;t mentioned Act was what was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted for &s;ecuring the Payment of the King's Cu&s;toms; but a very &s;hort Experience of it &s;hewed that it was defective, and did not an&s;wer the intended Purpo&s;e; for after an Information received by the Officers of the Cu&s;toms, the Time &s;pent in taking the nece&s;&s;ary Steps for ob|taining the Warrant, generally gave the Offenders an Opportunity of privately conveying away the Goods. A further Act was therefore nece&s;&s;ary; and we ac|cordingly find, that in le&s;s than two Years after, an Act was pa&s;&s;ed, entitled, <HI>An Act for preventing Frauds and regulating Abu&s;es in his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms.</HI> It is the 14th <HI>Char.</HI> II. Cap. II. the Preamble of which &s;ets forth, that, <Q>Forasmuch as it appears that &s;everal unlawful and indirect Means and Devices are daily put in Practice, to export and import Goods and Merchandi&s;es prohibited by the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, as al&s;o to de|fraud the King's mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty of his Dues, Cu&s;toms and Sub&s;idies, as well by &s;ecret and deceitful De&s;igns, as by open Force and Vio|lence u&s;ed again&s;t the King's Maje&s;ty's Officers employed in the Affairs of the Cu&s;toms; for the better preventing of which Frauds and Violences
<PB N="30" REF="013630_0031_0F91480D72F56CE8">
in Time to come,</Q> by the &s;aid Act, it is among other Things enacted, <Q>That it &s;hall be lawful for any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, authorized by Writ of A&s;&s;i&s;tance under the Seal of the Court of Ex|chequer, to take a Con&s;table, Headborough, or other publick Officer, being near the Place, and in the Day time to go and enter into any Hou&s;e, Shop, Cellar, Warehou&s;e, Room or other Place; and in ca&s;e of Re&s;i&s;tance, to break open Doors, Che&s;ts, Trunks, or other Package, there to &s;eize, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> any Kinds of Goods or Merchandi&s;e prohi|bited and uncu&s;tomed.</Q></P>
<P>"By this Act the Remedy became as complete as po&s;&s;ible; the Formality of making Oath before the Lord Trea&s;urer, a Baron of the Exchequer, or a chief Magi&s;trate, on every Information of uncu&s;|tomed or prohibited Goods, is di&s;pen&s;ed with, and no Time lo&s;t, and as little Opportunity as po&s;&s;ible given to &s;ecrete the Goods. Under this Act of Par|liament, the Officers of the Cu&s;toms in <HI>England</HI> are con&s;tantly armed with a Writ of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which is i&s;&s;ued by the Clerk of the Exchequer as a Thing of Cour&s;e, without any particular Application to the Court. Thus the Power of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Of|ficer is given him by Act of Parliament, and the Writ facilitates the Execution thereof: It is a No|tification to the Con&s;table of the Character and Sta|tion of the Officer; and is at the &s;ame Time a Se|curity to the Subject, again&s;t others who might pre|tend to that Character, without a Right to a&s;&s;ume it. By the former Act, the Officer acted under the Authority of any inferior Magi&s;trate; his Power now emanates from a higher and more &s;olemn Au|thority;
<PB N="31" REF="013630_0032_0F91480E4AA576C0">
a Writ under the Seal of the Court of Ex|chequer&mdash;a Di&s;obedience to which is a Contempt of the Court.</P>
<P>"It remains now to be con&s;idered, how the&s;e Powers came to be extended to the Officers of his Maje&s;ty's Revenue in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>"The fir&s;t Act of Parliament I &s;hall take Notice of for this Purpo&s;e is the 7 &amp; 8 of <HI>Will.</HI> III. Cap. 22. entitled, <HI>An Act for the more effectual preventing of Frauds, and regulating Abu&s;es in the Plantation-Trade in</HI> America. By this Act, it is among other Things provided, <Q>That the Officers for managing and collecting his Maje&s;ty's Revenue, and in&s;pec|ting the Plantation-Trade in any of the Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> &s;hall have the &s;ame Powers and Au|thority to vi&s;it and &s;earch Ships, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to enter Hou&s;es or Warehou&s;es, to &s;earch for, and &s;eize, prohibited or uncu&s;tomed Goods; and, that the like A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hall be given to the &s;aid Officers, in the Execution of their Office, as by the 14th <HI>Char.</HI> II. is provided for the Officers in <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"By this Act, it is evident the Intention of the Legi&s;lature was to cloath the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Offi|cers in <HI>America</HI> with the &s;ame Powers as tho&s;e in <HI>England.</HI> But as the 14 <HI>Char.</HI> II. directs the Writs of A&s;&s;i&s;tance to i&s;&s;ue from the Court of Exchequer, and as &s;uch Courts are not generally e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>America,</HI> for that Rea&s;on it became a Doubt whether any other Court could legally i&s;&s;ue &s;uch Writs.</P>
<P>"This made a further Act of Parliament nece&s;|&s;ary. Accordingly, by the 7th <HI>Geo.</HI> III. Cap. 46, after reciting the 14th <HI>Char.</HI> II. the 7 &amp; 8 <HI>Will.</HI> III. and then reciting, That no Authority being expre&s;|&s;ly
<PB N="32" REF="013630_0033_0F91480F03F4F080">
given by the Act of King <HI>William,</HI> to any parti|cular Court to grant &s;uch Writs of A&s;&s;i&s;tance for the Officers in the Plantations, it is doubted, whether &s;uch Officers can legally enter Hou&s;es, and other Places on Land, to &s;earch for the &s;eize Goods in the Manner directed by the &s;aid recited Acts. <Q>To obviate &s;uch Doubts for the future, and in order to carry the Intention of the &s;aid recited Acts into ef|ffectual Execution, it is enacted by the 7th <HI>Geo.</HI> III. That from and after the 20th of <HI>November</HI> 1767, &s;uch Writs of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to authorize and em|power the Officers of his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms, to enter, and go into any Hou&s;e, Warehou&s;e, Shop, Cellar, or other Place, in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies or Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> to &s;earch for, and &s;eize, prohibited and uncu&s;tomed Goods, in the Man|ner directed by the &s;aid recited Acts, &s;hall, and may be granted by the &s;uperior or &s;upreme Court of Ju&s;tice, having Juri&s;diction within &s;uch Colony or Plantation re&s;pectively.</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t Act, therefore, places the Matter be|yond all Doubt. It is a polar Star by which, agree|able to their Oath of Office, the Opinion of Law-Judges mu&s;t be guided, and their Determination concluded. It leaves not the &s;malle&s;t Opening for a &s;huffling Di&s;po&s;ition <HI>to run with the Hare, and hunt with the Hound.</HI> A po&s;itive Refu&s;al of a Judge to comply with an Act of Parliament, is a violent Breach of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and includes a Pro&s;ecu|tion for high and mighty Crimes and Mi&s;demeanours.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the Rea&s;ons which influenced the Chief Ju&s;tice to comply with the Motion. An ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="33" REF="013630_0034_0F91480FF0F37E80">
Acquaintance with the various Laws relating to the Cu&s;toms, from the earlie&s;t Period to the pre|&s;ent Time, informed this Ornament of the Bench how the Law &s;tood; and a <HI>Con&s;cience not ungrateful</HI> to the Remembrance of a &s;olemn Oath, con&s;trained him to determine according to Law. The three A&s;&s;i&s;tant-Judges, Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Savage, Co&s;lett,</HI> and <HI>Murray,</HI> concurred unanimou&s;ly in this Deci&s;ion, and gave weighty and &s;ub&s;tantial Rea&s;ons for coinciding with the Chief Ju&s;tice's Opinion. Even Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Fewtrell</HI> (who&s;e Conduct is mi&s;repre&s;ented by <HI>Free|man</HI> on this Occa&s;ion) entertained no Doubt of the <HI>Legality</HI> of i&s;&s;uing Writs of A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and only he&s;itated in concurring with the other Judges from an Uncertainty which was the &s;uperior Court of Ju&s;tice, the Court of Chancery or the Court of Common-Pleas; a Doubt which would have been entirely removed, by an Appeal to the Deci&s;ion of all the Judges in <HI>England,</HI> on a Que&s;tion propo&s;ed by the Lord Chancellor <HI>Talbot, Anno</HI> 1735, which was the &s;upreme Court of Ju&s;tice in the Kingdom. The Hou&s;e of Lords and the King's Bench were declared to be the two &s;upreme Courts of Ju&s;tice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Ob&s;ervations on Lord <HI>Ferrers'</HI>s Trial before the Lords.</NOTE></P>
<P>Having taken a comprehen&s;ive View of the Ar|guments which con&s;trained one "Set" of Judges, "Men without the <HI>vi&s;ible Shadow</HI> of Independence" to grant tho&s;e Writs, it will be only fair to con&s;ider what Motives could re&s;train another "Set" of Judges, <HI>Men of Property,</HI> from i&s;&s;uing &s;uch Writs. But, before I proceed further, it will not be ami&s;s to ob|&s;erve, that <HI>Freeman</HI> might have been contented with holding up his own Conduct to publick Ridicule,
<PB N="34" REF="013630_0035_0F91481074879220">
without introducing the Names of other Gentlemen to &s;hare a Part of his Calamity. It is with Regret I an&s;wer this Pa&s;&s;age in his Letter, as I am nece&s;&s;itated to analyze &s;omewhat unfavourably thereon; yet, perhaps, my Method of cen&s;uring may do the Gentlemen at lea&s;t as much Honour, as the ill-favoured Eulogiums be&s;towed on them by the Au|thor of the Letter to the Delegates.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Motive, therefore, which naturally oc|curs, why Judges, <HI>Men of Property,</HI> in a mercan|tile Colony like this, &s;hould determine contrary to <HI>written Law,</HI> might ari&s;e from a partial Adherence to Self-Intere&s;t. The <HI>be&s;t</HI> of Men, as Times now run, are induced to take every Step of aggrandizing their Fortunes. The Spirit of accumulating Dollars, when added to that di&s;&s;olving Satisfaction of Mind which a free born Subject of <HI>America</HI> ta&s;tes in &s;eeing a &s;tately Slave &s;tand on every Perch of his exten&s;ive Plantation, is &s;omewhat allayed by the bitter Re|membrance of paying Tribute to <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> I may with Truth here add, that our Brethren in <HI>England</HI> would heartily concur with <HI>Americans,</HI> in the Doc|trine of paying neither Taxes or Cu&s;toms (with which it mu&s;t be allowed they are heavily laden) were they not compelled by the po&s;itive Injunction of a &s;uperior Power, and with which, as inferiors, they are bound to comply.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Rea&s;on, why <HI>they refu&s;ed</HI> to grant tho&s;e Writs, is humourou&s;ly related by <HI>Freeman;</HI> becau&s;e the Opinion of the Bench was guided by <HI>Rawlins Lowndes,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who, <HI>Freeman</HI> a&s;&s;erts, was not bred regularly to the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Law; and the other Judges went to School to Mr. <HI>Lowndes,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="013630_0036_0F914813DF5E3A48">
who taught them to quaff &s;uch large Draughts of Law, as quickly enabled them to <HI>admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice with publick Approbation.</HI> This is, I think, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive De&s;cription of Quackery that ever caught my Attention. Indeed Empyri&s;m is di&s;played with &s;uch <HI>Pathos,</HI> that I would have con&s;idered it in no other Light than of a <HI>Burle&s;que</HI> on the "Set" of learned Judges referred to, was I not &s;en&s;ible that the ingenious Author of the Letter to the to the Delegates, intended, <HI>&s;ub ficto nomine,</HI> to be the Herald of his own Fame, and by the Side-Wind of his <HI>Eulogium</HI> on the great Abilities of Mr. <HI>Lowndes,</HI> "who had never eat Commons at the Temple," formed a De&s;ign to e&s;tabli&s;h an Idea of his own <HI>uncommon</HI> Powers, by the &s;ole Strength of which he hath been enabled to make &s;uch a rapid Progre&s;s in <HI>Law-Story,</HI> without the <HI>vulgar</HI> Aid of a <HI>Temple-</HI> Erudition.</P>
<P>I can now &s;incerely aver, that nothing but a warm Wi&s;h of promoting an Union between the Mother-Country and her Colonies, induced me to an&s;wer the mad Arguments of a Man, who, &s;oured by Di&s;|appointment, would widen the Breach of Di&s;con|tent: But, <HI>Americans!</HI> re&s;ume your Under&s;tanding, and di&s;countenance every De&s;ign of Faction. Famed as you are for Ju&s;tice, Humanity and Honour; it would ill become Men, ju&s;tly celebrated for &s;uch godlike Virtues, to &s;ubmit their Judgment as a Prey for Artifice to &s;port with; or to &s;uffer their Atten|tion to be diverted into any Channel but that which alone can render them a great and flouri&s;hing People.</P>
<P>Imperial <HI>Rome,</HI> which once gave Law to the World, fell by publick Di&s;contents, as much as by

Debauchery. Whil&s;t the <HI>Romans</HI> continued a firm united People, they extended their Conque&s;ts over the Earth; but when Faction reared its Head, and Per&s;ons thought it their Intere&s;t to embrace Ex|tremes, ambitious Men were not wanting to keep the&s;e Breaches open: It was then the ancient <HI>Roman</HI> Virtue began to decline. Publick Offices, which were in the Gift of the People, were generally filled by their de&s;igning Leaders; indeed the mo&s;t flagrant and turbulent Characters were commonly preferred. The guilty Cu&s;tom drawing into an E|&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;oon rendered the Air of <HI>Italy</HI> too polluted for <HI>Freedom</HI> or <HI>Order</HI> to dwell in; they therefore winged their Way: By which Flight the <HI>Romans</HI> lo&s;t them&s;elves and the Empire of the World together.</P>
