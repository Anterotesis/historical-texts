<HEAD>TO THE YOUNG READERS.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have now in your Hands a very &s;erious and pa|thetical SERMON, preach'd on a &s;olemn &amp; awful Occa&s;ion, which it is wi&s;h'd and hop'd may, by the Efficacy of the Spirit of Grace, prove a means of Awakening, of Re&s;traint, and of Conver&s;ion to many of you.</P>
<P>It is to be taken Notice of, That of the many Malefactors which have &s;uffer'd Death among us within the Space of <HI>Six|teen Years</HI> pa&s;t, not above one of them was born in this Country. But now our GOD has humbled us by leaving a Child of the <HI>Town,</HI> one under the &s;acred <HI>Bonds of the Covenant,</HI> to tho&s;e Ini|quities, more e&s;pecially the repeated Crimes of <HI>Uncha&s;tity,</HI> which have ripen'd her for the Vengeance of a Capital Execution; in which God has <HI>&s;et</HI> her <HI>forth for an Example</HI> to the Children of <HI>New-England,</HI> to warn them not to Sin away their Convictions and Awakenings, and by rebelling again&s;t His Holy Spirit, provoke Him to take off His Re&s;traints, and &s;o leave them to tho&s;e Cour&s;es that &s;hall undo and de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>It may be there is no Place in the World, where &s;uch Pains are taken with condemn'd Criminals to prepare them for their Death; that <HI>in the De&s;truction of the Fle&s;h, the Spirit may be &s;aved in the Day of the Lord Je&s;us.</HI> The compa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Judges</HI> always allow a con&s;iderable Time (commonly a <HI>Month</HI> at lea&s;t) after the Sentence is pronounc'd, before the Execution is proceeded in. All this while they are vi&s;ited, it may be every Day, by &s;ome or other of the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Town, to in&s;truct them, direct them, and pray with them. They have al&s;o the Liberty to attend in our publick A&s;&s;emblies, on <HI>Lecture-Days</HI> and on <HI>Lord's Days,</HI> that they may have the Benefit of tho&s;e Ordinances which CHRIST has appointed, and by the Working of His Spirit makes to be the effectual Means of the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of Sinners; when both the <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Sermons</HI> are adapted to their particular Ca&s;e &amp; Circum&s;tances, while it is at the &s;ame time endeavour'd to improve the Providence for the Benefit of the numerous Concour&s;e of People, e&s;pecially of the <HI>Younger Sort,</HI> which u&s;ually appear on &s;uch an Occa&s;ion</P>
<P>It was on the <HI>la&s;t Sabbath</HI> of her Life, that this poor <HI>Dau'ter of Death,</HI> and the great A&s;&s;embly pre&s;ent, were entertain'd with
<PB N="ii" REF="003655_0004_10023E3AA1638410">
the following Di&s;cour&s;e, on a Subject very &s;utably cho&s;en, &s;tu|diou&s;ly calculated, not to gratify an itching Ear, but to reach the Heart and awaken the Con&s;cience; and therefore drawn up very much in Scripture Language, which carries a peculiar Force and Pungency with it; and is now publi&s;h'd with ad|vantagious Enlargements in &s;ome Parts of the Application. The poor Creature her &s;elf afterwards &s;pake of it, and of the publi&s;hing it, in &s;uch a Manner as gives &s;ome Rea&s;on to hope, it came <HI>with Power</HI> upon her Soul.</P>
<P>To this is added the Conference had with her in the Way to her Execution, by our <HI>worthy Brother</HI> who to gratify her own De|&s;ire attended her thither; and has now recollected the Sub&s;tance of what occur'd in that Conver&s;ation, to gratify &s;ome of his Friends who reque&s;ted it of him; by which it appears the la&s;t, &amp; there|fore mo&s;t precious Minutes of her Life, were improv'd to the be&s;t Advantage. Her An&s;wers indeed were but &s;hort; as &s;he never us'd to &s;ay much when we di&s;cour&s;ed with her. But the Que&s;tions were the mo&s;t proper &amp; &s;utable that could be, leading her, by a &s;tudy'd &amp; regular, yet ea&s;y &amp; familiar Train of Tho't, into tho&s;e grand Points, in which <HI>is the Life of our Spirit.</HI> Many will be pleas'd, and I hope profited, to &s;ee them. The Reader may place him&s;elf in the View of Death, and then put them to his own Soul, till he feels the Impre&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>It appear'd to me one of the be&s;t Symptoms upon this poor Crimi|nal, that &s;he &s;eem'd de&s;irous her Example might be a Warning to others. She did therefore, of her own Accord, de&s;ire &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters, &s;olemnly to caution Young People, not to have <HI>their Life,</HI> as hers had been, <HI>among the Unclean.</HI> So that in this Publication we do but come to you with a Me&s;&s;age from the dead; Or, She her &s;elf does, as it were, come from the dead to warn you: tho', if you <HI>hear not Mo&s;es and the Prophets,</HI> Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and his ordinary Mini&s;ters, <HI>neither would you be per&s;wad|ed tho' one &s;hould</HI> indeed <HI>come from the dead</HI> and &s;peak unto you. However <HI>that</HI> might terrifie you, it of it &s;elf would not, could no convert you, unle&s;s the Holy Spirit &s;et in with His Almigh|ty Influences, which are mo&s;t likely to be afforded in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Means which are of his own Appointment.</P>
<P>How fit a Word is this, which GOD has directed his Ser|vant to, wherewith to addre&s;s the Young Sinner, the vain and lewd Youth? If this will not awaken your Fears, to hear of the <HI>Wrath of Almighty GOD</HI> which is incens'd again&s;t you, and of that <HI>Stroke</HI> of his powerful Vengeance to which you are every Moment expos'd, and which, when it is once given, will &s;end you into that <HI>Place of Mi&s;ery,</HI> from which there is <HI>no Redemp|tion,</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="003655_0005_10023E6574838310">
no, not thro'out the endle&s;s Ages of Eternity; if this, I &s;ay, will not alarm your Fears, and awaken in you a mo&s;t &s;ol|licitous Concern how to e&s;cape the dreadful Danger you are in, and provide for the &s;afety of your never-dying Soul, what will? If you can read &s;uch a Sermon as <HI>this,</HI> and &s;till conti|nue fearle&s;s and carele&s;s, and indulge your &s;elf in criminal Cour&s;es, in tho&s;e Impurities which <HI>the Holy One of I&s;rael</HI> cannot look upon without the utmo&s;t Abhorrence; may it not ju&s;tly be fear'd, that God has in a judicial way, <HI>pour'd out upon you the Spirit of deep Sleep,</HI> and given you up to your own Hearts Lu&s;ts till by filling up the mea&s;ure of your Sin, you become prepared for that amazing Stroke, in which the&s;e awful Words will be again fulfill'd, and which will make you a Warning to others, as others have been to you?</P>
<P>I know there is in your Hearts a cur&s;ed Principle of Infidelity, that will &s;ugge&s;t to you, <HI>"I &s;hall have Peace, tho' I walk in the Imagination of my Heart, and add Iniquity to Iniquity."</HI> You may be ready to think your &s;elves as &s;ecure of your Lives, as if you had made a Bargain with Death, not to come till you &s;end for him; not to <HI>take you away with a Stroke,</HI> but to let you &s;tand till old Age gradually con&s;umes you. So there were &s;ome of old who lull'd them&s;elves a&s;leep in carnal Security, &s;ay|ing, <HI>"We have made a Covenant with Death, and with Hell we are at Agreement; when the overflowing Scourge &s;hall pa&s;s through, it &s;hall not come unto us."</HI> But they had this An&s;wer from the Lord God, <HI>"Your Covenant with Death &s;hall be di&s;annulled, and your Agreement with Hell &s;halt not &s;tand; when the overflowing Scourge &s;hall pa&s;s through, then ye &s;hall be troden down by it."</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 28. 15, 18.</NOTE> Don't then <HI>make Lies your Refuge,</HI> or &s;eek to <HI>cover your &s;elves in hiding Places of Deceit.</HI> Has not the Ju&s;tice of God, made quick Work with other Sinners? When they have cried, <HI>Peace, Peace; &s;udden De&s;truction has overtaken them.</HI> You &s;ee here, It was an Ob&s;ervation in the Days of <HI>Elihu, "They die in Youth,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Lives are among the Unclean".</HI> And has not the Ob&s;ervation been verified all along, from that Day to this? For the <HI>Scrip|ture</HI> is continually fulfilling in <HI>Providence.</HI></P>
<P>I could my &s;elf tell you of a <HI>Youth</HI> whom I knew that was once of very Promi&s;ing Hopes, but as he grew to Manhood &s;adly di&s;appointed the Expectations of tho&s;e who before that <HI>beholding him loved him.</HI> Being ask'd by a religious Friend who was griev'd to &s;ee &s;uch an Alteration in him, "How he had laid out his Life, and intended to &s;pend it"? He an&s;wer'd to this Purpo&s;e, "In <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ting the Plea&s;ures of it as much as he could" Upon
<PB N="iv" REF="003655_0006_10023DC641F524F8">
which being &s;ea&s;onably put in Mind, That the Time of his Life might be &s;horter than he was aware of; He made this Reply. "That he doubted not but he &s;hou'd &s;ee <HI>four&s;core Years</HI> at lea&s;t." But within that Number of <HI>Days,</HI> he was taken away with the &s;troke of a &s;udden &amp; immature Death, in &s;uch a Way as made the <HI>Ears of all that heard it to tingle.</HI> Behold now the Severity and goodne&s;s of God! Towards them who have been taken away by His Stroke, <HI>Righteous Severity;</HI> but towards thee, who art &s;till &s;pared and warned, <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> if thou do&s;t not continue to de&s;pi&s;e and abu&s;e it.</P>
<P>I have two Things to reque&s;t of you before you read this Ser|mon, and then I'll no longer detain you. The one is, That you would <HI>pray over it</HI> before you read it; that God would accompany the Reading of it with the Effectual Operation of his Spirit, with|out which the mo&s;t Powerful Words Man can u&s;e, will be but as <HI>a dead Letter,</HI> altogether ineffectual to Convert &amp; Sanctify you.</P>
<P>The other is, That after you have read it, You would allow your &s;elf Time to <HI>think on what you have read,</HI> and enter into a &s;olemn Debate with your own Soul thereupon. Seriou&s;ly ask your &s;elf then, "Whether you can think it &s;afe to continue in your &s;inful Cour&s;es one Day longer?" "Whether it is not the Madne&s;s of Folly in you, to loo&s;e your Soul, your precious and immortal Soul, rather than part with a ba&s;e Lu&s;t"? "Whether you had not better forego the Company of Sinners now, than have your Soul gather'd with them hereafter"? If any of you &s;hould &s;till &s;ay, <HI>"I have loved Strangers, and after them I will go".</HI> "I mu&s;t indulge my Lu&s;ts and enjoy my &s;inful Companions, tho' I forfeit the Favour of God, and expo&s;e my &s;elf to his Vengeance for ever". Then, Know it, You wilfully damn your own Soul: You <HI>chu&s;e Death</HI> in the Cau&s;es of it. Your <HI>Part</HI> mu&s;t be with <HI>the Unbelieving, and the Abominable, in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd Death.</HI> You <HI>&s;hall go</HI> when you die, and that will be very &s;oon, <HI>to the Generation of your Fathers,</HI> the unclean Sinners that have died before you, and are &s;hut up in the Pri&s;on of Darkne&s;s; You <HI>&s;hall never &s;ee Light: So &s;hall thy Doom be, Thou thy &s;elf ha&s;t decided it.</HI></P>
<P>But that God may ble&s;s this Di&s;cour&s;e to every <HI>one</HI> of you that &s;hall read it, to pre&s;erve the <HI>Virtuous</HI> Youth, reclaim the <HI>Vicious,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Pious;</HI> and &s;o make the Preaching and Pub|li&s;hing it &s;erve to heighten the Author's Joy, and brighten his Crown in the Day of CHRIST, is the hearty Prayer of</P>

<HEAD>A Le&s;&s;on of Caution TO YOUNG SINNERS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOB XXXVI. 14, and 18.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>They die in Youth, and their Life is among the Unclean. Becau&s;e there is Wrath, beware le&s;t He take thee away with his Stroke: then a great Ran&s;om cannot de|liver thee.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Text is very awful and affecting; de&s;erves the &s;erious Tho'ts of all, but e&s;pecially challenges a more inten&s;e Con&s;ideration from our Young People. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear. Let the&s;e &s;ayings &s;ink down into your Ears, and be written on your Hearts. By di&s;cour&s;ing on the Text, may I be &s;o happy, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, as to prevent the fulfilling of it among our Young People! Of whom I &s;ee &s;o numerous a Concour&s;e on the pre&s;ent &s;olemn Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>They are the words of <HI>Elihu,</HI> who having un|dertaken to &s;peak on God's behalf, in Vindica|tion of his dealings with <HI>Job,</HI> fir&s;t gives him (as in the preceeding Context) a brief account of
<PB N="2" REF="003655_0008_10023E0B069A2F80">
the various methods of Providence towards the Children of Men, &s;uted to their different Tempers and Carriages towards God; and then gives him agreable Coun&s;els and Admonitions thereupon. <HI>Elihu</HI> ob&s;erves to him the de&s;ign of God in bring|ing Men under the Bonds of Affliction; that it is with a view to their &s;piritual Benefit, for the good of their Souls, <HI>ver.</HI> 8, 9, 10.&mdash;In the next place he ob&s;erves the different I&s;&s;ue of a right Improve|ment of Divine Corrections, and of Impenitence under the Hand of God, <HI>ver.</HI> 11, 12. He fur|ther amplifies on the Ca&s;e of impenitent Sinners, in the two next Ver&s;es, <HI>ver.</HI> 13, 14.</P>
<P>And then, after having made &s;ome particular Remarks on <HI>Job'</HI>s ca&s;e, he proceeds to give him that &s;olemn Caution, in the 18<HI>th. ver&s;e,</HI> not to make light of God's Wrath, but to fear le&s;t he &s;hould fall a Sacrifice to the Divine Vengeance. Even good Men have enough ami&s;s in 'em, to expo&s;e them to God's Wrath, if He &s;hould enter into Judgment with them. It was therefore a proper and &s;ea&s;o|nable Caution: and if &s;o holy and good a Man, as <HI>Job,</HI> needed &s;uch a Caution, &s;urely impenitent Sinners much more have need of this &s;olemn Warning. It is a Word more e&s;pecially fit to ad|dre&s;s &s;ecure Sinners withal: tho' 'tis al&s;o applicable to all others, good as well as bad; young and old.</P>
<P>'Tis the proper U&s;e and Application of the Hint given in the 14<HI>th</HI> ver&s;e, concerning the mi&s;erable End of Impenitents: and therefore I've connect|ed the&s;e two Ver&s;es, for the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>They die in Youth, and their Life is a|mong the Unclean: Becau&s;e there is Wrath, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak to the Words under the&s;e Three di&s;tinct Heads.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="003655_0009_10023E67D16EEFB8">
1. Mankind are &s;ometimes taken out of the World by an <HI>early Death,</HI> even in the days of their <HI>Youth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Of tho&s;e, who die in Youth, many there be, <HI>who&s;e Life is among the Unclean.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e Reflections &s;hould <HI>awaken</HI> all, and particularly young People, to a <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Concern,</HI> le&s;t God in his Wrath &s;hould <HI>take them away with a &s;troke,</HI> leaving them no Hope of Relief.</P>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>Mankind are often taken out of the World by an</HI> Early <HI>and</HI> untimely <HI>Death.</HI>&mdash;It's the Ca&s;e of many, <HI>They die in Youth,</HI> a premature Death.</P>
<P>I am aware, That &s;ome take <HI>Youth</HI> here in a figurative &s;en&s;e, and under&s;tand the Text to mean, They die in <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Folly.</HI> For he that has not yet learn'd to live as he ought, &s;eems to die prematurely: and he that dies prematurely, &s;eems to die as an Infant, that can't di&s;cern its right hand and its left. The old Man, that is a late Penitent, dies a very <HI>Child:</HI> and the Impenitent, though he may have been an hundred Years in the World, yet he has not truly <HI>lived</HI> &s;o much as one day, if he at la&s;t dies in his Sins.</P>
<P>But others take the Word in a proper &s;en&s;e, as intending the Age of Youth, the Morning of Life. Nor &s;ee I any Occa&s;ion to depart from the literal Con&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is an obvious Truth, that Multitudes are taken out of the World by an early Death. There are Multitudes, who peri&s;h in the Womb, and never &s;ee the Light: Multitudes that die in Infancy; having breath'd a few days or months, they ex|pire and vani&s;h: Multitudes, that die in Child|hood and Youth. Many are taken away in the
<PB N="4" REF="003655_0010_10023E1DD7D79B70">
mid&s;t of their Days; and many attain not to this; they &s;carce live out half their Days.</P>
<P>The longe&s;t Liver in the&s;e times may be &s;aid to die in Youth, if compared with tho&s;e in the fir&s;t Ages of the World. Many in primitive times attain'd to nigh a Thou&s;and Years. But there has &s;ince been a wonderful Abbreviation of the Life of Man;&mdash;of which no Philo&s;ophical Ac|count has yet been given, to the &s;atisfaction of rational Inquirers: but we are oblig'd to content our&s;elves with Theological Rea&s;ons, and mu&s;t re|&s;olve this my&s;terious Event into the &s;overeign Plea&s;ure and Providence of God.&mdash;From <HI>Mo&s;es'</HI>s time the extent of human Life in general has been but about Seventy or Eighty Years. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 90. 10. This is the common Boundary, which few exceed, and Multitudes fall &s;hort of.</P>
<P>Va&s;t Numbers (as I &s;aid) are taken away in the mid&s;t of their Days, and yet more in the Be|ginning of their Years. The Di&s;pen&s;ation of early Death is common both to the Ju&s;t and Unju&s;t.</P>
<P>The early Death of the <HI>Righteous</HI> is a <HI>my&s;terious</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, of which &s;carce any other Account can be given but that, <HI>Even &s;o, Father, becau&s;e it hath &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight!</HI>&mdash;However, many Things might be &s;aid to ju&s;tify the Providence of God herein; and particularly this, that altho' God &s;hortens the days of &s;uch in this World, yet he gives them length of Days and Life everla&s;ting in a better: So that the Cur&s;e is turn'd into a Ble&s;&s;ing, as to them. Untimely Death is in it&s;elf evil, and a fruit of the Cur&s;e: but to one in Chri&s;t, it becomes a &s;urpri&s;ing Mercy; for it turns to his Salvation, and ha&s;tens his eternal Happine&s;s and Glory.</P>

But to the Wicked this Di&s;pen&s;ation is in <HI>Judg|ment.</HI> Shortne&s;s of Days is often threaten'd in Scripture, as a Puni&s;hment of Sin. Prov. 10. 27. <HI>The Years of the Wicked &s;hall be &s;hortned.</HI> So Eccl. 8. 13. <HI>It &s;hall not be well with the Wicked; neither &s;hall he prolong his Days, which are as a &s;hadow, be|cau&s;e he feareth not before God.</HI>&mdash;And P&s;al. 55. 23. <HI>Thou, O God, &s;halt bring them down into the Pit of De|&s;truction: bloody and deceitful Men &s;hall not live out half their Days,</HI> i. e. not half the ordinary Age of Man, not half &s;o long as they might live in the u&s;ual Cour&s;e of Nature.</P>
<P>But whether they be righteous or wicked, whe|ther it be in Mercy or in Judgment, we often &s;ee very affecting In&s;tances of early Death. How many are in their Youth cut off by pining Sickne&s;s How many by fatal Ca&s;ualties! When God com|mi&s;&s;ions Death to arre&s;t any, he regards not the Beauty or the Vigour of Youth: that cannot bribe, nor this re&s;i&s;t him. When the Death-Warrant is &s;ign'd, the King of Terrors becomes inexorable, and &s;pares not the ruddy Youth, any more than the hoary Head. He minds not Age or Quality, Sex or Rank: but every one, when his Hour is come, falls by the impartial Hand of this common Devourer. By the Greatne&s;s of his &s;trength &s;hall none prevail: nor will the pitiable Tenderne&s;s of any obtain a Reprieve for them. The Children and Sucklings he makes to pour out their Soul into their Mother's Bo&s;om: He cru&s;hes the Young Men with a Rod of Iron, and treads the Daugh|ters of Zion, as in a Wine-pre&s;s. In how many In&s;tances do we &s;ee that fulfilled, Job 21. 23, 24. <HI>One dieth in his full &s;trength being wholly at ea&s;e and quiet, his Brea&s;ts full of Milk, and his Bones moi&s;t|ned

with Marrow.</HI>&mdash;Them that bid faire&s;t for long Life, how often do we &s;ee cut off by the &s;troke of Death: Some in the way of Nature, by a fatal Di&s;temper; others in the way of Violence, by a &s;udden Accident, by the Hand of Malice, or the Sword of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Herein is the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God di&s;play'd: and his <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is herein exalted. For every Death is an Execution of the primitive Cur&s;e, and an Exerci&s;e of the Divine Dominion over the Life of Man: and in particular early Death is eminently &s;o. There is al&s;o the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of God to be &s;een in his ordering Death unto Mankind in all Periods and Ages of Life; ina&s;much as their being at an Uncertainty about the Time of their dying, and not knowing but that they may die in Youth, tends to excite in 'em a Care of early Preparation for Death.</P>
<P>In a word, while we behold the &s;everity of God to &s;ome in cutting them off by an untimely Death, We that &s;urvive &s;hould be more deeply affected with a &s;en&s;e of the di&s;tingui&s;hing goodne&s;s of God to us, in pre&s;erving us hitherto; e&s;pecially &s;ince we have forfeited our Lives by innumerable Pro|vocations. We have been expos'd to the &s;ame Perils, as others; we are by Nature Children of Wrath, even as others; our Childhood and Youth has been Vanity, full of Sin and Folly, even more perhaps than many others were guilty of, that have been taken away before us.&mdash;And &s;hall not the&s;e Con&s;iderations &s;trike our Hearts; fill us with Ad|miration of the Divine Patience towards us, and lead us to Repentance! O let us devote our re|prieved Lives to the Honour of God; by who&s;e Vi&s;itation out Spirits have been pre&s;erved. Let

Let that be the Tho't of our Heart, our Re&s;olution and our Petition con|tinually, P&s;al. 56. 12, 13. <HI>Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render prai&s;es unto thee.

<P>There are different Con&s;tructions of this Pa&s;&s;age: Some refer it to the pre&s;ent Life, and others to that which is to come.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) We may take it as re&s;pecting the <HI>pre&s;ent Life.</HI> The Word [<HI>is</HI>] not being in the Hebrew Text, our Tran&s;lators have &s;upply'd the Vacancy with that; as perhaps under&s;tanding <HI>Elihu</HI> to &s;peak here of the Life future. But if it be under&s;tood of the Life, which now is, there may other Sup|pletives be made u&s;e of; and accordingly, various Glo&s;&s;es may be made on the Words</P>
<P N="1">1. Thus, it may be read, <HI>Their Life</HI> is &s;een to have been <HI>among the Unclean.</HI> However they may have hid their Wickedne&s;s heretofore; yet now, when they come to die, they are detect|ed, or confe&s;s; the Mask is pull'd or thrown off, and it appears they were but whited Se|pulchres, fair without, but foul within. Now the Mouths of Men are open'd to &s;peak what they know of their wicked Lives; the Providence of God &s;trangely brings to Light their hidden Iniquities; or Con&s;cience compels them to a Con|fe&s;&s;ion.

The Hypocrite's Hope peri&s;hes in Death, and many times vani&s;heth at the Apprehen&s;ion of Death approaching; &s;o that the fal&s;e Profe&s;&s;or, tho' perhaps he formerly appear'd to have a &s;a|cred Heat of Love and Grace in his Soul, yet now confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to have been under the power of a fatal Cold in divine Things, &amp; to have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd no other Heat than that of fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the Soul: and he now numbers him|&s;elf among the Unclean, calls him&s;elf a &s;piritual Adulterer, who made Preten&s;ions of Love to Chri&s;t, as the Guide of his Youth, but yet only flatter'd him with his Mouth, while in Reality his Heart went a whoring after the World, led away with divers Lu&s;ts.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, the Text may be read, <HI>Their Life</HI> is found <HI>among the Unclean,</HI> that is, they are found <HI>living in Uncleanne&s;s,</HI> when Death comes and takes them away. In a State of Sin, and it may be in the Act of Sin, Death &s;urprizes 'em, and drives them away in their Wickedne&s;s. I might in&s;tance in wicked <HI>Er</HI> and <HI>Onan,</HI> tho&s;e Brethren in Iniquity, whom the Lord &s;lew for their abo|minable Filthine&s;s, that they died before their Time.

So <HI>Korah</HI> and his Company, Wicked|ne&s;s was among&s;t them &amp; in their Dwellings, and the Earth open'd her Mouth, and &s;wallow'd them up, and they went down alive into the Pit.&mdash;Many are thus cut off by the more immediate hand of God.

<P N="3">3. Again, The Text may be read, <HI>Their Life</HI> is taken away <HI>among the Unclean,</HI> i. e. in <HI>Company</HI> with them, or by a Death ignominious as theirs. They are in their Death <HI>number'd among the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors:</HI> Cut off for their Sins, by a &s;hameful Execution, as Criminals. They are cut off <HI>after the manner</HI> of unclean Per&s;ons, by an infamous Death. The original Word in our Text, for <HI>the Unclean,</HI> is in other places frequently render'd <HI>Sodomites:</HI> and &s;ome read it, Their Life <HI>is cut off after the &s;ame Manner as Sodomites</HI> are cut off, that are mo&s;t hate|fully unclean, abominably wicked, i. e. by a vile and &s;hameful Death. As if it had been &s;aid, They die in Youth, and come to an ignominious End.</P>
<P N="4">4. Finally, If we read it thus, <HI>Their Life</HI> is taken away <HI>among the Unclean,</HI> it may intend, they die <HI>like</HI> the wor&s;t of Sinners, as to their <HI>Frame</HI> and <HI>Carriage.</HI> The Hypocrites in heart, of whom <HI>Elihu</HI> had been &s;peaking, often make as poor a figure in the Approaches of Death, as the openly Profane: they behave no better than the mo&s;t foul and &s;candalous Sinners; either dying under the power of bruti&s;h Stupidity, or el&s;e in helli&s;h De&s;pair. <HI>Balaam'</HI>s Wi&s;h was wont to be theirs, That they might die the <HI>Death of the Righteous:</HI> but alas! how often do we &s;ee, that the Hypocrite

<P N="2">(2) To give you another Glo&s;s upon the Text, which refers the Life here &s;poken of unto the <HI>future State.</HI> And I find &s;ome of the mo&s;t judi|cious Expo&s;itors under&s;tanding it in this Sen&s;e: <HI>Their Life is among the Unclean,</HI> i. e. their <HI>future</HI> Life is &s;o: the Life of their Souls in the &s;eparate State is, and the Life of their Bodies in the Re|&s;urrection-State &s;hall be, among the Unclean; among <HI>Sodomites,</HI> in the <HI>everla&s;ting Fire</HI> The fil|thy Sinners of <HI>Sodom</HI> who gave them&s;elves over to Fornication, and went after &s;trange Fle&s;h, are &s;aid (<HI>Jude</HI> 7<HI>th</HI>) to be <HI>&s;et forth for an Example, &s;uffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire.</HI></P>
<P>The vain and lewd Youth, that dies in his Sins, yea the mo&s;t moral and virtuous Youth, that dies out of Chri&s;t, unpardon'd and unrenew'd in the Spirit of his mind, mu&s;t have his Portion with the unclean Spirits in Hell. <HI>When he giveth up the Gho&s;t, where is he?</HI> Whither does he go?

afterwards is among the Unclean. They lie down in Sorrow; and in Hell they lift up their Eyes, being in Torments.&mdash;There they bear the Re|proach of their Youth. God in Anger now writes bitter Things indeed again&s;t them, &amp; makes them to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Iniquities of their Youth: the&s;e, which once were as &s;weet Mor&s;els in their Mouth, are as the Gall of A&s;ps to them now. Bitter, bit|ter are their Reflections on lo&s;t Time, on the Mi&s;|&s;pence of Youth, the golden Opportunity of Life, and the <HI>only</HI> Opportunity (as it prov'd) to them. Con&s;cience now la&s;hes terribly, and reads the mo&s;t doleful Le&s;&s;ons to them. They &s;ee an amazing ETERNITY before 'em, &amp; have a certain fear|ful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation to devour them for ever and ever. They were <HI>cut down out of Time</HI> (as the Phra&s;e is <HI>Job.</HI> 22. 16) their Life was <HI>&s;oon cut off,</HI> and their Souls flew a|way: But alas! the days that were wanting on Earth, are made up in Hell. He that dies in Youth, with his Sins unpardon'd and unrepented of, enters immediately upon a never-expiring State of Woe &amp; Mi&s;ery, Sorrow &amp; De&s;pair. His &s;hort Life of Sin here is follow'd with a long (long) Eternity of Sufferings &amp; Torment. And in <HI>pro|portion</HI> to their Guilt, is the future Puni&s;hment of Sinners greater or le&s;s. They that have peri&s;hed from under the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> &s;hall have a more intolera|ble Damnation, than even the Sinners of <HI>Sodom</HI> and the heathen World. And &s;uch under the Go&s;pel as have contracted the greate&s;t Degrees of Guilt, &s;hall have the mo&s;t aggravated Puni&s;hment.

<HEAD>The Declaration, DYING Warnings and Advice OF Rebekah Chamblit, A Young Woman aged near Twenty-&s;even Years, Executed at Bo&s;ton, September 27th. 1733.</HEAD>
<P>BEING under the awful Apprehen&s;ions of my Executi|on now in a few Hours; and being de&s;irous to do all the Good I can, before I enter the Eternal World, I now in the fear of GOD, give this Declaration and Warning to the Living.</P>
<P>I Was very tenderly brought up, and well In&s;tructed in my Father's Hou&s;e, till I was Twelve Years of Age; but a|la&s;s, my Childhood wore off in vanity. However, as I grew in Years, my Youth was under very &s;en&s;ible Impre&s;&s;ions from the SPIRIT of GOD; and I was awakened to &s;eek and obtain Bapti&s;m, when I was about Sixteen Years of Age; and lived for &s;ome time with a &s;trictne&s;s &s;omewhat an&s;werable to the Obligations I was thereby brought under. But within two or three Years after this, I was led away into the Sin of Un|cleanne&s;s, from which time I think I may date my Ruin for this World. After this, I became again more watchful, and for &s;everal Years kept my &s;elf from the like Pollutions, until tho&s;e for which I am now to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>And as it may be nece&s;&s;ary, &s;o doubtle&s;s it will be expected of me, that I give the World a particular account of that great Sin, with the aggravations of it, which has brought me to this Shameful Death: And accordingly in the fear of GOD, at who&s;e awful Tribunal I am immediately to appear, I &s;olemnly de|clare as follows;</P>
<P><PB REF="003655_0076_10023E32E3531F10">
That on Saturday the Fifth Day of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, being then &s;omething more than Eight Months gone with Child, as I was about my Hou&s;hold Bu&s;ine&s;s reaching &s;ome Sand from out of a large Cask, I received con&s;iderable hurt, which put me into great Pain, and &s;o I continued till the Tue&s;day following; in all which time I am not &s;en&s;ible I felt any Life or Motion in the Child within me; when, on the &s;aid Tue&s;day the Eighth Day of <HI>May,</HI> I was Deliver'd when alone of a Male Infant; in whom I did not perceive Life; but &s;till uncertain of Life in it, I threw it into the Vault about two or three Minutes after it was born; <HI>uncertain</HI> I &s;ay, whether it was a living or dead Child; tho', I confe&s;s its probable there was Life in it, and &s;ome Cir|cum&s;tances &s;eem to confirm it. I therefore own the Ju&s;tice of GOD and Man in my Condemnation, and take Shame to my &s;elf, as I have none but my &s;elf to Blame; and am &s;orry for any ra&s;h Expre&s;&s;ions I have at any time uttered &s;ince my Condem|nation; and I am verily per&s;waded there is no Place in the World, where there is a more &s;trict regard to Ju&s;tice than in this Province.</P>
<P>And now as a Soul going into Eternity, I mo&s;t earne&s;tly and &s;olemnly Warn all Per&s;ons, particularly YOUNG PEOPLE, and more e&s;pecially tho&s;e of my own Sex, again&s;t the Sins which their Age peculiarly expo&s;es them to; and as the Sin of Un|cleanne&s;s has brought me into the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Circum&s;tances, I would with the greate&s;t Importunity Caution and Warn a|gain&s;t it, being per&s;waded of the abounding of that Sin in this Town and Land. I thought my &s;elf as &s;ecure, a little more than a Year ago, as many of you now do; but by woful Expe|rience I have found, that Lu&s;t when it has conceived bringeth forth Sin, and Sin when it is fini&s;hed bringeth forth Death; it expo&s;es the Soul not only to Temporal, but to Eternal Death. And therefore as a Dying Per&s;on, let me call upon you to for&s;ake the fooli&s;h and live: Do not accompany with tho&s;e you know to be &s;uch, and if Sinners entice you do not con&s;ent. I am &s;en|&s;ible there are many Hou&s;es in this Town, that may be called Hou&s;es of Uncleanne&s;s, and Places of dreadful Temptations to this and all other Sins. O &s;hun them, for they lead down to the Chambers of Death and Eternal Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>My mi&s;pending of precious Sabbaths, lies as a heavy burden upon me; that when I might have gone to the Hou&s;e of GOD, I have been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">different, and &s;uffer'd a &s;mall matter to keep me from it. What would I wow give, had I better improv'd the Lord's Day. I tell you, verily, your lo&s;t Sabbaths will &s;it hea|vy
<PB REF="003655_0077_10023E2A6CD80AA0">
upon you, when you come into the near pro&s;pect of Death and Eternity.</P>
<P>The Sin of Lying I have to bewail, and wou'd earne&s;tly cau|tion again&s;t; not that I have took &s;o great a plea&s;ure in Lying; but I have often done &s;o to conceal my Sin: Certainly you had better &s;uffer Shame and Di&s;grace, yea the greate&s;t Puni&s;hment, than to hide and conceal your Sin, by Lying. How much bet|ter had it been for me, to have confe&s;s'd my Sin, than by hid|ing of it to provoke a holy GOD, thus to &s;uffer it to find me out! But I hope I heartily de&s;ire to ble&s;s GOD, that even in this way, He is thus entring into Judgment with me; for I have often thought, had I been let alone to go on undi&s;covered in my Sins, I might have provok'd Him to leave me to a cour&s;e of Rebellion, that would have ripen'd me for a more &s;udden and everla&s;ting De&s;truction; and am fully convinc'd of this, that I &s;hould have had no &s;olid ea&s;e or quiet in my mind, but the Guilt of this undi&s;cover'd Sin lying upon my Con&s;cience, would have been a tormenting Rack unto me all my Days; whereas now I hope GOD has di&s;cover'd to me in &s;ome mea&s;ure the evil of this, and all my other Sins, and enabled me to repent of them in Du&s;t and A&s;hes; and made me earne&s;tly de&s;ire and plead with Him for pardon and clean&s;ing in the precious Blood of the REDEEMER of lo&s;t and peri&s;hing Sinners: And I think I can &s;ay, I have had more comfort and &s;atisfaction within the Walls of this Pri&s;on, than ever I had in the ways of Sin among my vain Companions, and think I wou'd not for a World, nay for ten Thou&s;and Worlds have my liberty in Sin again, and be in the &s;ame Condition I was in before I came into this Place.</P>
<P>I had the advantage of living in &s;everal religious Families: but ala&s;s, I di&s;regarded the In&s;tructions and Warnings I there had, which is now a bitterne&s;s to me; and &s;o it will be to tho&s;e of you who are thus favoured, but go on unmindful of GOD, and deaf to all the Reproofs and Admonitions that are given you for the good of your Souls. And I would advi&s;e tho&s;e of my own Sex e&s;pecially, to chu&s;e to go into religious Families, where the Wor&s;hip and Fear of GOD is maintained, and &s;ubmit your &s;elves to the Orders and Government of them.</P>
<P>In my younger Years I maintain'd a con&s;tant cour&s;e of Se|cret Prayer for &s;ome time; but afterwards neglecting the &s;ame, I found by experience, that upon my thus leaving GOD, He was provoked to for&s;ake me, and at length &s;uffer'd me to fall into that great and complicated Sin that has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> this
<PB REF="003655_0078_10023DE90983B310">
Death: Mind me, I fir&s;t left GOD, and then he left me: I therefore &s;olemnly call upon YOUNG PEOPLE to cheri&s;h the Convictions of GOD's Holy SPIRIT, and be &s;ure keep up a con&s;tant cour&s;e of fervent Secret Prayer.</P>
<P>And now I am ju&s;t entring into the Eternal World, I do in the fear of GOD, and before Witne&s;&s;es, call upon our YOUNG PEOPLE in particular, to &s;ecure an Intere&s;t in the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and in tho&s;e precious Benefits He has purcha&s;ed for His People; for &s;urely the favour of GOD, thro' CHRIST, is more worth than a whole World: And O what Comfort will this yield you when you come to that awful Day and Hour I am now arriving unto. I mu&s;t tell you, the World appears to me vain and empty, nothing like what it did in my pa&s;t Life, my Days of Sin and Vanity, and as doubtle&s;s it appears now to you. Will you be per&s;waded by me to that which will yield you the be&s;t Satisfaction and Plea&s;ure here, and which will prepare you for the more abundant Plea&s;ures of GOD's Right Hand for evermore?</P>
