<P>OUR own happine&s;s, my Coun|trymen, and the happine&s;s of our po&s;terity, will in a great mea&s;ure depend upon our conduct in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is: let that conduct therefore be &s;uch as the im|portance of the event demands; and let not prejudice, immediate &s;elf-inte|re&s;t, or that pronene&s;s to novelty and change, too often predominent in &s;tates as well as individuals, lead us into &s;uch mea&s;ures as will bring de&s;truction up|on our&s;elves, and induce future ages to execrate the folly and madne&s;s of their infatuated forefathers.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e colonies, (notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e acts of the Bri|ti&s;h Parliament which are complained of, as too grievous and oppre&s;&s;ive to

be borne, and again&s;t which our patriots rai&s;e &s;uch a terrible and tremendous cry) are the free&s;t people upon the globe, and if we were &s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ing, I might add the happie&s;t al&s;o. Survey the different nations of the world, compare their &s;ituation with your own, and you will &s;oon become &s;en&s;ible of the ine&s;timable advantages you enjoy over them. Do not there|fore inadvertantly &s;acrifice them to the vi&s;ionary &s;chemes of mi&s;taken or de|&s;igning men. By prudence, firmne&s;s and moderation, we &s;hall in&s;ure the continuance of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings to our|&s;elves, and be enabled to tran&s;mit them pure, and unadulterated to our child|ren: but if we aim at too much, if we &s;uffer our&s;elves to be led away with vain notions of <HI>grandeur</HI> and <HI>indepen|dance,</HI> we may lo&s;e the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> while we gra&s;p at the <HI>&s;hadow,</HI> and this our fair &s;tructure of liberty and happine&s;s, which &s;eems calculated to endure thro'

a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, will moulder into nothing, and like the <HI>ba&s;ele&s;s fa|bric of a vi&s;ion, leave not a wreck be|hind.</HI> Great Britain is the ba&s;is upon which it &s;tands. In union with her, we may ri&s;e &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the world, and &s;et all the kingdoms of the earth at defiance. But if by our un|grateful treatment of her, &s;he &s;hould be induced to withdraw her protection, and give us over to our own imagina|tions, nothing but anarchy and confu|&s;ion mu&s;t en&s;ue, the flames of civil di&s;cord would in&s;tantly blaze forth, and de&s;olate the land, and amid&s;t the dreadful and unnatural conflict, &s;ome internal tyrant, more fortunate than the re&s;t would e&s;tabli&s;h his dominion; or &s;ome bold invader from abroad &s;eize upon us an ea&s;y and devoted prey, and deprive us of our liberties and boa&s;ted independence for ever.</P>
<P>Such are the &s;cenes that will pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our view, and &s;uch the
<PB N="6" REF="013772_0005_0F91AC4955611560">
calamities we mu&s;t undergo when di&s;|joined from our mother country; and deprived of that protection which nouri&s;hed, &s;upported, and e&s;tabli&s;hed us in this once inho&s;pitable wilderne&s;s, and which hath at length rai&s;ed us to our pre&s;ent happy and flouri&s;hing con|dition. Believe not therefore &s;uch men as tell you that Great Britain would en&s;lave you; Great Britain wi&s;hes to &s;ee us free and happy; &s;he is the land of liberty, and would gladly di&s;pen&s;e that ble&s;&s;ing to her children, and to all the world. But her mini&s;ters are men, and as &s;uch may err; they may ignorantly or inadvertantly adopt mea|&s;ures that are injurious to the com|munity, and &s;ubver&s;ive of its liberties. But the people can &s;urely never be ju&s;tified in proceeding to open rebel|lion, at lea&s;t, till all peaceful, legal and con&s;titutional means of redre&s;s have proved ineffectual.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="013772_0006_0F91AC4AC4FCB008">
We complain of grievances, my countrymen; we &s;ay that our liberties are invaded; but what &s;teps have we hitherto taken for our relief? Have we not acted in all re&s;pects more like fools, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, than like rea&s;on|able beings, warmed with the pure and &s;teady flame of liberty? Have we not pur&s;ued &s;uch mea&s;ures as mu&s;t in|evitably increa&s;e the evil; and if longer adhered to, make the breach between us, and our mother country IRREPA|RABLE? while we have neglected &s;uch as common &s;en&s;e and common pru|dence dictated to us as the mo&s;t ea&s;y and effectual. Are not our ASSEMBLIES the proper guardians of our rights and liberties? are they not con&s;tituted our Repre&s;entatives for that very purpo&s;e? can there be more effectual mediators between us and Great Britain than they are? I am certain there cannot. TO THEM therefore we ought to have applied, we &s;hould then have proceed|ed
<PB N="8" REF="013772_0007_0F91AC4CB2728530">
legally and con&s;titutionally, and might have had the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. But alas! &s;o &s;trangely have we been infatuated. we have re&s;umed the power into our own hands, and every man is become a judge and a ruler among us. The whole &s;y&s;tem of government is overturned, and all order and &s;ubordination lo&s;t. In this unruly and di&s;orderly manner we are making our attack upon Great Britain; like the giants of old warring again&s;t heaven, <HI>piling O&s;&s;a upon Pelion, and Pelion upon O&s;&s;a,</HI> fully determined to <HI>force</HI> her to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Our conduct is too dreadful to be &s;ported with; yet &s;o ridiculous, that it tempts us to laugh|ter. 'Tis like the unaccountable freaks of a madman, we cannot forbear &s;miling at them, though our hearts bleed inwardly for the un|happy &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>One mea&s;ure I mu&s;t confe&s;s has been adopt|ed, which &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s, and which at <HI>fir&s;t</HI> view, appeared to be dictat|ed by the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, and that was the appointment of delegates to meet in general congre&s;s. Tho&s;e gentlemen, it was hoped would fall upon &s;ome &s;cheme to accommodate the di&s;pute between Great Britain and America, and mark out a line of government, that would &s;ufficiently a&s;certain, and e&s;tabli&s;h the right of juri&s;diction in the one, and &s;ecure the liber|ties of the other. Which <HI>plan,</HI> when well
<PB N="9" REF="013772_0008_0F91AC4D0D977A18">
dige&s;ted, the few rea&s;onable and think|ing men that were among us, imagined they would have had the mode&s;ty to have &s;ubmitted to the legi&s;latures of the different provinces, for their ap|probation, and <HI>&s;anction.</HI> This is what they ought to have done; this is what all hone&s;t and wi&s;e men would have done. But mark the conduct of the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onages, &s;elected from among their fellow &s;ubjects, for the &s;alvation of their country. They met; and while the attention of all Ameri|ca was fixed upon them, in eager, anx|ious expectation, a re&s;olve, unanimou&s;|ly entered into by them, was promul|gated to the public, adopting and ap|proving the infamous and rebellious re&s;olves of the county of Suffolk, in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts government.</P>
<P>I am bound in honour and con&s;ci|ence to do &s;o much ju&s;tice to tho&s;e gentlemen of the Congre&s;s who were delegated by this province, as to &s;ay,
<PB N="10" REF="013772_0009_0F91AC4DB5B4B010">
that I have been a&s;&s;ured, and I verily believe it to be the truth, that they did oppo&s;e the violent mea&s;ures enter|ed into by the General Congre&s;s, and more particularly the adoption of the Suffolk re&s;olves, which I know is ab|horrent to their thoughts, and which I am per&s;uaded (to make u&s;e of a &s;muggling phra&s;e) has been artfully run upon them.</P>
<P>This was effectually throwing off the ma&s;k; and their &s;ub&s;equent con|duct has convinced the world, that from that time forward they acted without di&s;gui&s;e. They have addre&s;&s;|ed the people of <HI>England,</HI> they have addre&s;&s;ed the people of <HI>Quebec,</HI> they have addre&s;&s;ed the people of the other Colonies; but for what purpo&s;e, un|le&s;s it be to excite tumults and &s;editi|ons, in all parts of the Briti&s;h Empire, I defy the mo&s;t &s;agacious to di&s;cover. 'Tis true they have addre&s;&s;ed the King al&s;o; but I am told, and I can ea&s;ily
<PB N="11" REF="013772_0010_0F91AC4E667CB4F8">
believe it, in a dictatorial manner, and in &s;ure and certain hopes of being di&s;|regarded. But amid&s;t all the&s;e ad|dre&s;&s;es, the legi&s;lature of Great Britain, and the legi&s;latures of America have been totally neglected and treated with contempt. This however is not the full mea&s;ure of their <HI>iniquity;</HI> a non|importation, and, after a lap&s;e, of &s;ome months, a non-exportation, and non|con&s;umption agreement, mu&s;t take place, in con&s;equence of their re&s;olves; and to be enforced by their <HI>High Mightine&s;&s;es</HI> the MOB, to the utter &s;ub|ver&s;ion of all <HI>Law,</HI> and the total de|&s;truction of all LIBERTY.</P>
<P>The fatal and dreadful effects of this non-importation &s;cheme, &amp;c. upon all ranks of people; but more e&s;peci|ally upon the in&s;ulted and unhappy <HI>Farmers</HI> (who it &s;eems mu&s;t bear the heat and burden of the day) have been &s;ufficiently delineated by an abler hand. I &s;hall therefore &s;ay nothing

further upon that &s;ubject, although, they cannot be too often cautioned, and admoni&s;hed of the danger, and de&s;truction that is coming fa&s;t upon them.</P>
<P>One thing however I will venture to do, and that, becau&s;e I conceive it to be my duty, as a good &s;ubject. I will give my free and candid opinion upon what ought to be done in this alarming juncture; upon what I con|ceive to be the only mea&s;ure that can prove effectual, or that can &s;ave us from political perdition: it is what ought to have been done at fir&s;t, and what, thank <HI>God,</HI> 'tis not yet too late to do.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t leave the government of this province to the con&s;titutional ru|lers thereof; we mu&s;t &s;ubmit the con|duct of our affairs to our <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> our hopes (under heaven) mu&s;t re&s;t in them. And notwith&s;tanding the ill|judged and unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions, thrown
<PB N="13" REF="013772_0012_0F91AC5133FFF360">
upon that <HI>honourable body,</HI> by weak and wicked men, I am convinced they will have virtue and &s;pirit enough to vindicate the cau&s;e of their country, and to re&s;cue from the hands of <HI>arro|gance</HI> and <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI> that authority which has been delegated to them for the mo&s;t valuable and important pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>Li&s;ten, my countrymen, to the voice of rea&s;on; be no longer blind to your happine&s;s. The <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> are a body of men compo&s;ed of your own Repre|&s;entatives, Per&s;ons placed in that ho|nourable and important &s;tation, by your own choice, freely and publicly made, and you have the &s;tronge&s;t rea|&s;on to believe, that they will faithful|ly and invariably con&s;ult your welfare and pro&s;perity, in all their delibera|tions.

You will likewi&s;e have this con|&s;olation in our pre&s;ent extremely dangerous condition, when ruin &s;eems almo&s;t inevitable, that the&s;e your con&s;titutional repre&s;entatives will have due weight with the government at home; their petitions, their remon&s;trances you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves will be heard, and if they proceed with prudence, and firmne&s;s, of which I cannot entertain a doubt, your griev|ances, if there are any, they will be redre&s;&s;|ed, and you will again be re&s;tored to that peace and good government with which till lately you have been &s;o &s;ingularly ble&s;&s;ed. But if you &s;uffer the power to be wre&s;ted from their hands, by men whom you are entirely un|acquainted with, and for who&s;e honour and hone&s;ty you can po&s;&s;ibly have no &s;ecurity.
