<HEAD>THE EXAMINATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Q. WHAT is your Name and Place of Abode?</P>
<P>A. <HI>Franklin</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>Q. Do the <HI>Americans</HI> pay any con&s;iderable Taxes among them&s;elves?</P>
<P>A. Certainly many, and very heavy Taxes.</P>
<P>Q. What are the pre&s;ent Taxes in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> laid by the Laws of the Colony?</P>
<P>A. There are Taxes on all E&s;tates real and per&s;onal, a Poll Tax, a Tax on all Offices, Professions, Trades and Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, according to their Profits; an Exci&s;e on all Wine, Rum, and other Spirits; and a Duty of Ten Pounds <HI>per</HI> Head on all Ne|groes imported, with &s;ome other Duties.</P>
<P>Q. For what Purpo&s;es are tho&s;e Taxes laid?</P>
<P>A. For the Support of the civil and military E&s;tabli&s;hments of the Country, and to di&s;charge the heavy Debt contracted in the la&s;t War.</P>
<P>Q. How long are tho&s;e Taxes to continue?</P>
<P>A. Those for di&s;charging the Debt are to continue till 1772, and longer, if the Debt &s;hould not be then all di&s;charged. The others mu&s;t always continue.</P>
<P>Q. Was it not expected that the Debt would have been &s;ooner di&s;charged?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="010303_0003_0F7E736F59B60418">
A. It was, when the Peace was made, with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> but a fre&s;h War breaking out with the <HI>Indians,</HI> a fre&s;h Load of Debt was incurred, and the Taxes, of Course, continued longer by a new Law.</P>
<P>Q. Are not all the People very able to pay tho&s;e Taxes?</P>
<P>A. No, the Frontier Counties, all along the Continent, having been frequently ravaged by the Enemy, and greatly impoveri&s;hed, are able to pay very little Tax. And therefore, in Con&s;ideration of their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, our late Tax Laws do expre&s;sly favour tho&s;e Counties, excu&s;ing the Sufferers; and I &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame is done in other Governments.</P>
<P>Q. Are not you concerned in the Management of the Po&s;t|Office in <HI>America?</HI></P>
<P>A. Yes. I am Deputy Po&s;t-Ma&s;ter General of <HI>North-Ame|rica.</HI></P>
<P>Q. Don't you think the Di&s;tribution of Stamps, by Po&s;t, to all the Inhabitants, very practicable, if there was no Oppo&s;ition?</P>
<P>A. The Po&s;ts only go along the Sea Coa&s;ts; they do not, ex|cept in a few In&s;tances, go back into the Country; and if they did, &s;ending for Stamps by Po&s;t would occa&s;ion an Expence of Po&s;tage, amounting, in many Ca&s;es, to much more than that of the Stamps them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Q. Are you acquainted with <HI>Newfoundland?</HI></P>
<P>A. I never was there.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know whether there are any Po&s;t Roads on that I&s;land?</P>
<P>A. I have heard that there are no Roads at all; but that the Communication between one Settlement and another is by Sea only.</P>
<P>Q. Can you di&s;per&s;e the Stamps by Po&s;t in <HI>Canada?</HI></P>
<P>A. There is only a Po&s;t between <HI>Montreal</HI> and <HI>Quebec.</HI> The Inhabitants live &s;o &s;cattered and remote from each other, in that va&s;t Country, that Po&s;ts cannot be &s;upported among them, and therefore they cannot get Stamps <HI>per</HI> Po&s;t. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colo|nies too, along the Frontiers, are very thinly &s;ettled.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="010303_0004_0F7E7370A9A0C0E8">
Q. From the Thinne&s;s of the back Settlements, would not the Stamp-Act be extreamly inconvenient to the Inhabitants, if ex|ecuted?</P>
<P>A. To be &s;ure it would; as many of the Inhabitants could not get Stamps when they had Occa&s;ion for them, without taking long Journeys, and &s;pending perhaps Three or Four Pounds, that the Crown might get Six-pence.</P>
<P>Q. Are not the Colonies, from their Circum&s;tances, very able to pay the Stamp-duty.</P>
<P>A. In my Opinion, there is not Gold and Silver enough in the Colonies to pay the Stamp-duty for one Year.</P>
<P>Q. Don't you know that the Money ari&s;ing from the Stamps was all to be laid out in <HI>America?</HI></P>
<P>A. I know it is appropriated by the Act to the <HI>American</HI> Service; but it will be &s;pent in the conquered Colonies, where the Soldiers are, not in the Colonies that pay it.</P>
<P>Q. Is there not a Ballance of Trade due from the Colonies where the Troops are po&s;ted, that will bring back the Money to the old Colonies?</P>
<P>A. I think not. I believe very little would come back. I know of no Trade likely to bring it back. I think it would come from the Colonies where it was &s;pent directly to <HI>England;</HI> for I have always ob&s;erved, that in every Colony the more plenty the Means of Remittance to <HI>England,</HI> the more Goods are &s;ent for, and the more Trade with <HI>England</HI> carried on.</P>
<P>Q. What Number of white Inhabitants do you think there are in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania?</HI></P>
<P>A. I &s;uppo&s;e there may be about 160,000.</P>
<P>Q. What Number of them are Quakers?</P>
<P>A. Perhaps a Third.</P>
<P>Q. What Number of <HI>Germans?</HI></P>
<P>A. Perhaps another Third; but I cannot &s;peak with Cer|tainty.</P>
<P>Q. Have any Number of the <HI>Germans</HI> &s;een Service, as Soldiers, in <HI>Europe?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010303_0005_0F7E7371093BEFF8">
A. Yes,&mdash;many of them, both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Q. Are they as much di&s;&s;atisfied with the Stamp-duty as the <HI>English?</HI></P>
<P>A. Yes, and more; and with Rea&s;on, as their Stamps are, in many Ca&s;es, to be double.</P>
<P>Q. How many white Men do you &s;uppo&s;e there are in <HI>North-America?</HI></P>
<P>A. About 300,000, from Sixteen to Sixty Years of Age.</P>
<P>Q. What may be the Amount of one Year's Imports into <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> from <HI>Britain?</HI></P>
<P>A. I have been informed that our Merchants compute the Im|ports from <HI>Britain</HI> to be above 500,000 Pounds.</P>
<P>Q. What may be the Amount of the Produce of your Pro|vince exported to <HI>Britain?</HI></P>
<P>A. It mu&s;t be &s;mall, as we produce little that is wanted in <HI>Britain.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e it cannot exceed 40,000 Pounds.</P>
<P>Q. How then do you pay the Ballance?</P>
<P>A. The Ballance is paid by our Produce carried to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and &s;old in our own I&s;lands, or to the <HI>French, Spaniards, Danes</HI> and <HI>Dutch;</HI> by the &s;ame carried to other Colonies in <HI>North-America,</HI> as to <HI>New-England, Nova-Scotia, Newfoundland, Carolina</HI> and <HI>Georgia;</HI> by the &s;ame carried to different Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> as <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> In all which Places we receive either Money, Bills of Exchange, or Commodities that &s;uit for Remittance to <HI>Britain;</HI> which, together with all the Profits on the Indu&s;try of our Merchants and Mariners, ari&s;ing in tho&s;e circuitous Voyages, and the Freights made by their Ships, center finally in <HI>Britain,</HI> to di&s;charge the Ballance, and pay for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures continually u&s;ed in the Province, or &s;old to Foreigners by our Traders.</P>
<P>Q. Have you heard of any Difficulties lately laid on the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Trade?</P>
<P>A. Yes, I have heard that it has been greatly ob&s;tructed by &s;ome new Regulations, and by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men of War and Cutters &s;tationed all along the Coa&s;t in <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010303_0006_0F7E737199EA2F90">
Q. Do you think it right that <HI>America</HI> &s;hould be protected by this Country, and pay no Part of the Expence?</P>
<P>A. That is not the Ca&s;e. The Colonies rai&s;ed, cloathed and paid, during the la&s;t War, near 25000 Men, and &s;pent many Millions.</P>
<P>Q. Were you not reimbur&s;ed by Parliament?</P>
<P>A. We were only reimbur&s;ed what, in your Opinion, we had advanced beyond our Proportion, or beyond what might rea&s;onably be expected from us; and it was a very &s;mall Part of what we &s;pent. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> in particular, di&s;bur&s;ed a|bout 500,000 Pounds, and the Reimbur&s;ements, in the whole, did not exceed 60,000 Pounds.</P>
<P>Q. You have &s;aid that you pay heavy Taxes in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> what do they amount to in the Pound?</P>
<P>A. The Tax on all E&s;tates, Real and Per&s;onal, is Eighteen Pence in the Pound, fully rated; and the Tax on the Profits of Trades and Profe&s;&s;ions, with other Taxes, do, I &s;uppo&s;e, make full Half a Crown in the Pound.</P>
<P>Q. Do you know any Thing of the Rate of Exchange in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and whether it is fallen lately?</P>
<P>A. It is commonly from 170 to 175. I have heard that it has fallen lately from 175 to 162 and a Half, owing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to their le&s;&s;ening their Orders for Goods; and when their Debts to this Country are paid, I think the Exchange will probably be at Par.</P>
<P>Q. Do not you think the People of <HI>America</HI> would &s;ubmit to pay the Stamp-duty, if it was moderated?</P>
<P>A. No, never, unle&s;s compelled by Force of Arms.</P>
<P>Q. Are not the Taxes in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> laid on unequally, in order to burthen the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, particularly the Tax on Profe&s;&s;ions and Bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P>A. It is not more burthen&s;ome in Proportion than the Tax on Lands. It is intended, and &s;uppo&s;ed to take an equal Pro|portion of Profits.</P>
<P>Q. How is the A&s;&s;embly compo&s;ed? Of what Kinds of People are the Members, Landholders or Traders?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010303_0007_0F7E7374C0274A98">
A. It is compo&s;ed of Landholders, Merchants and Artificers.</P>
<P>Q. Are not the Majority Landholders?</P>
<P>A. I believe they are.</P>
<P>Q. Do not they, as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;hift the Tax off from the Land, to ea&s;e that, and lay the Burthen heavier on Trade?</P>
<P>A. I have never under&s;tood it &s;o. I never heard &s;uch a Thing &s;ugge&s;ted. And indeed an Attempt of that Kind could an&s;wer no Purpo&s;e. The Merchant or Trader is always &s;killed in Fi|gures, and ready with his Pen and Ink. If unequal Burthens are laid on his Trade, he puts an additional Price on his Goods; and the Con&s;umers, who are chiefly Landholders, finally pay the greate&s;t Part, if not the Whole.</P>
<P>Q. What was the Temper of <HI>America</HI> towards <HI>Great-Britain</HI> before the Year 1763?</P>
<P>A. The be&s;t in the World. They &s;ubmitted willingly to the Government of the Crown, and paid, in all their Courts, Obedience to Acts of Parliament. Numerous as the People are in the &s;everal old Provinces, they co&s;t you nothing in Forts, Citadels, Garri&s;ons or Armies, to keep them in Subjection. They were governed by this Country at the Expence only of a little Pen, Ink and Paper. They were led by a Thread. They had not only a Re&s;pect but an Affection, for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> for its Laws, its Cu&s;toms and Manners, and even a Fondne&s;s for its Fa&s;hions, that greatly increa&s;ed the Commerce. Natives of <HI>Britain</HI> were always treated with particular Regard; to be an <HI>Old England-man,</HI> was, of it&s;elf, a Character of &s;ome Re&s;pect, and gave a Kind of Rank among us.</P>
<P>Q. And what is their Temper now?</P>
<P>A. O, very much altered.</P>
<P>Q. Did you ever hear the Authority of Parliament to make Laws for <HI>America</HI> que&s;tioned till lately?</P>
<P>A. The Authority of Parliament was allowed to be valid in all Laws, except &s;uch as &s;hould lay internal Taxes. It was never di&s;puted in laying Duties to regulate Commerce.</P>
<P>Q. In what Proportion hath Population increa&s;ed in <HI>America?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010303_0008_0F7E7375E97480C8">
A. I think the Inhabitants of all the Provinces together, taken at a Medium, double in about 25 Years. But their De|mand for <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures increa&s;es much fa&s;ter, as the Con&s;umption is not merely in Proportion to their Numbers, but grows with the growing Abilities of the &s;ame Numbers to pay for them. In 1723, the whole Importation from <HI>Britain</HI> to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> was but about 15,000 Pounds Sterling; it is now near Half a Million.</P>
<P>Q. In what Light did the People of <HI>America</HI> u&s;e to con&s;ider the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI></P>
<P>A. They con&s;idered the Parliament as the great Bulwark and Security of their Liberties and Priviledges, and always &s;poke of it with the utmo&s;t Re&s;pect and Veneration. Arbitrary Mini&s;ters, they thought, might po&s;&s;ibly, at Times, attempt to oppre&s;s them; but they relied on it, that the Parliament, on Applica|tion, would always give Redre&s;s. They remembered, with Gratitude, a &s;trong In&s;tance of this, when a Bill was brought into Parliament, with a Clau&s;e to make Royal In&s;tructions Laws in the Colonies, which the Hou&s;e of Commons would not pa&s;s, and it was thrown out.</P>
<P>Q. And have they not &s;till the &s;ame Re&s;pect for Parliament?</P>
<P>A. No; it is greatly le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>Q. To what Cau&s;es is that owing?</P>
<P>A. To a Concurrence of Cau&s;es; the Re&s;traints lately laid on their Trade, by which the bringing of foreign Gold and Silver into the Colonies was prevented; the Prohibition of making Paper Money among them&s;elves; and then demanding a new and heavy Tax by Stamps; taking away, at the &s;ame Time, Trials by Juries, and refu&s;ing to receive and hear their humble Petitions.</P>
<P>Q. Don't you think they would &s;ubmit to the Stamp-Act, if it was modified, the obnoxious Parts taken out, and the Duty reduced to &s;ome Particulars, of &s;mall Moment?</P>
<P>A. No; they will never &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P>Q. What do you think is the Rea&s;on that the People of <HI>Ame|rica</HI> increa&s;e fa&s;ter than in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010303_0009_0F7E7376252C3088">
A. Becau&s;e they marry younger, and more generally.</P>
<P>Q. Why &s;o?</P>
<P>A. Becau&s;e any young Couple that are indu&s;trious, may ea&s;ily obtain Land of their own, on which they can rai&s;e a Fa|mily.</P>
<P>Q. Are not the lower Rank of People more at their Ea&s;e in <HI>America</HI> than in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>A. They may be &s;o, if they are &s;ober and diligent, as they are better paid for their Labour.</P>
<P>Q. What is your Opinion of a future Tax, impo&s;ed on the &s;ame Principle with that of the Stamp-Act; how would the <HI>Americans</HI> receive it?</P>
<P>A. Ju&s;t as they do this. They would not pay it.</P>
<P>Q. Have you not heard of the Re&s;olutions of this Hou&s;e, and of the Hou&s;e of Lords, a&s;&s;erting the Right of Parliament re|lating to <HI>America,</HI> including a Power to tax the People there?</P>
<P>A. Yes, I have heard of &s;uch Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>Q. What will be the Opinion of the <HI>Americans</HI> on tho&s;e Re|&s;olutions?</P>
<P>A. They will think them uncon&s;titutional, and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Q. Was it an Opinion in <HI>America</HI> before 1763, that the Par|liament had no Right to lay Taxes and Duties there?</P>
<P>A. I never heard any Objection to the Right of laying Duties to regulate Commerce; but a Right to lay internal Taxes was never &s;uppo&s;ed to be in Parliament, as we are not repre&s;ented there.</P>
<P>Q. On what do you found your Opinion, that the People, in <HI>America</HI> made any &s;uch Di&s;tinction?</P>
<P>A. I know that whenever the Subject has occurred in Con|ver&s;ation where I have been pre&s;ent, it has appeared to be the Opinion of every one, that we could not be taxed in a Parlia|ment where we were not repre&s;ented. But the Payment of Duties laid by Act of Parliament, as Regulations of Commerce, was never di&s;puted.</P>
<P>Q. But can you name any Act of A&s;&s;embly, or public Act of any of your Governments, that made &s;uch Di&s;tinction?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010303_0010_0F7E7377307F15B8">
A. I do not know that there was any; I think there was ne|ver an Occa&s;ion to make any &s;uch Act, till now that you have attempted to tax us; that has occa&s;ioned Re&s;olutions of A&s;&s;em|bly, declaring the Di&s;tinction, in which I think every A&s;&s;em|bly on the Continent, and every Member in every A&s;&s;embly, have been unanimous.</P>
<P>Q. What then could occa&s;ion Conver&s;ations on that Subject before that Time?</P>
<P>A. There was in 1754 a Propo&s;ition made (I think it came from hence) that is ca&s;e of a War, which was then apprehend|ed, the Governors of the Colonies &s;hould meet, and order the levying of Troops, building of Forts, and taking every other ne|ce&s;&s;ary Mea&s;ure for the general Defence; and &s;hould draw on the Trea&s;ury here for the Sums expended, which were afterwards to be rai&s;ed in the Colonies by a general Tax, to be laid on them by Act of Parliament. This occa&s;ioned a good deal of Conver&s;a|tion on the Subject, and the general Opinion was, that the Par|liament neither would nor could lay any Tax on us, till we were duly repre&s;ented in Parliament, becau&s;e it was not ju&s;t, nor a|greeable to the Nature of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Q. Don't you know there was a Time in <HI>New-York,</HI> when it was under Con&s;ideration to make an Application to Parliament to lay Taxes on that Colony, upon a Deficiency ari&s;ing from the A&s;&s;embly's refu&s;ing or neglecting to rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary Supplies for the Support of the Civil Government?</P>
<P>A. I never heard of it.</P>
<P>Q. There was &s;uch an Application under Con&s;ideration in <HI>New-York;</HI> and do you apprehend they could &s;uppo&s;e the Right of Parliament to lay a Tax in <HI>America</HI> was only local, and confi|ned to the Ca&s;e of a Deficiency in a particular Colony, by a Re|fu&s;al of its A&s;&s;embly to rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary Supplies?</P>
<P>A. They could not &s;uppose &s;uch a Ca&s;e, as that the A&s;&s;embly would not rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary Supplies to &s;upport its own Go|vernment. An A&s;&s;embly that would refu&s;e it mu&s;t want com|mon Sen&s;e, which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed. I think there was never any &s;uch Ca&s;e at <HI>New-York,</HI> and that it mu&s;t be a Mi&s;repre&s;en|tation,
<PB N="12" REF="010303_0011_0F7E73779A889A40">
or the Fact mu&s;t be mi&s;under&s;tood. I know there have been &s;ome Attempts, by mini&s;terial In&s;tructions from hence, to oblige the A&s;&s;emblies to &s;ettle permanent Salaries on Gover|nors, which they wi&s;ely refu&s;ed to do; but I believe no A&s;&s;em|bly of <HI>New-York,</HI> or any other Colony, ever refu&s;ed duly to &s;upport Government by proper Allowances, from Time to Time, to public Officers.</P>
<P>Q. But in Ca&s;e a Governor, acting by In&s;truction, &s;hould call on an A&s;&s;embly to rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary Supplies, and the A&s;|&s;embly &s;hould refu&s;e to do it, do you not think it would then be for the good of the People of the Colony, as well as nece&s;&s;a|ry to Government, that the Parliament &s;hould tax them?</P>
<P>A. I do not think it would be nece&s;&s;ary. If an A&s;&s;embly could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o ab&s;urd as to refu&s;e rai&s;ing the Supplies requi|&s;ite for the Maintenance of Government among them, they could not long remain in &s;uch a Situation; the Di&s;orders and Confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by it mu&s;t &s;oon bring them to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Q. If it &s;hould not, ought not the Right to be in <HI>Great-Bri|tain</HI> of applying a Remedy?</P>
<P>A. A Right only to be u&s;ed in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, I &s;hould have no Objection to, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be u&s;ed merely for the good of the People of the Colony.</P>
<P>Q. But who is to judge of that, <HI>Britain</HI> or the Colony?</P>
<P>A. Tho&s;e that feel can be&s;t judge.</P>
<P>Q. You &s;ay the Colonies have always &s;ubmitted to external Taxes, and object to the Right of Parliament only in laying in|ternal Taxes, now can you &s;hew that there is any kind of Dif|ference between the two Taxes to the Colony on which they may be laid?</P>
<P>A. I think the Difference is very great. An external Tax is a Duty laid on Commodities imported; that Duty is added to the fir&s;t Co&s;t, and other Charges on the Commodity, and when it is offered to Sale, makes a Part of the Price. If the People do not like it at that Price, they refu&s;e it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal Tax is forced from the People with|out their Con&s;ent, if not laid by their own Repre&s;entatives.
<PB N="13" REF="010303_0012_0F7E73785A36F3E8">
The Stamp-act &s;ays, we &s;hall have no Commerce, make no Exchange of Property with each other, neither purcha&s;e nor grant, nor recover Debts; we &s;hall neither marry, nor make our Wills, unle&s;s we pay &s;uch and &s;uch Sums, and thus it is intend|ed to extort our Money from us, or ruin us by the Con&s;equen|ces of refu&s;ing to pay it.</P>
<P>Q. But &s;uppo&s;ing the external Tax or Duty to be laid on the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life imported into your Colony, will not that be the &s;ame Thing in its Effects as an internal Tax?</P>
<P>A. I do not know a &s;ingle Article imported into the Nor|thern Colonies, but what they can either do without, or make them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Q. Don't you think Cloth from <HI>England</HI> ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to them?</P>
<P>A. No, by no Means ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; with Indu&s;try and good Management, they may very well &s;upply them&s;elves with all they want.</P>
<P>Q. Will it not take a long Time to e&s;tabli&s;h that Manufac|ture among them? and mu&s;t they not in the mean while &s;uffer greatly?</P>
<P>A. I think not. They have made a &s;urprizing Progre&s;s al|ready. And I am of Opinion, that before their old Clothes are worn out, they will have new Ones of their own making.</P>
<P>Q. Can they po&s;&s;ibly find Wool enough in <HI>North-America?</HI></P>
<P>A. They have taken Steps to increa&s;e the Wool. They entered into general Combinations to eat no more Lamb, and very few Lambs were killed la&s;t Year. This Cour&s;e per&s;i&s;ted in, will &s;oon make a prodigious Difference in the Quantity of Wool. And the e&s;tabli&s;hing of great Manufactories, like tho&s;e in the Clothing Towns here, is not nece&s;&s;ary, as it is where the Bu&s;ine&s;s is to be carried on for the Purpo&s;es of Trade. The People will all &s;pin, and work for them&s;elves, in their own Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Q. Can there be Wool and Manufacture enough in one or two Years?</P>
<P>A. In three Years, I think, there may.</P>

Q. Does not the Severity of the Winter, in the Northern Colonies, occa&s;ion the Wool to be of bad Quality?</P>
<P>A. No; the Wool is very fine and good.</P>
<P>Q. In the more Southern Colonies, as in <HI>Virginia;</HI> don't you know that the Wool is coar&s;e, and only a kind of Hair?</P>
<P>A. I don't know it. I never heard it. Yet I have been &s;ometimes in <HI>Virginia.</HI> I cannot &s;ay I ever took particular No|tice of the Wool there, but I believe it is good, tho' I cannot &s;peak po&s;itively of it; but <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the Colonies South of it, have le&s;s Occa&s;ion for Wool; their Winters are &s;hort, and not very &s;evere, and they can very well clothe them&s;elves with Linen and Cotton of their own rai&s;ing for the re&s;t of the Year.</P>
<P>Q. Are not the People, in the more Northern Colonies, ob|liged to fodder their Sheep all the Winter.</P>
<P>A. In &s;ome of the mo&s;t Northern Colonies they may be ob|liged to do it &s;ome Part of the Winter.</P>
<P>Q. Con&s;idering the Re&s;olutions of Parliament, as to the Right, do you think, if the Stamp-act is repealed, that the <HI>North-Americans</HI> will be &s;atisfied?</P>
<P>A. I believe they will.</P>
<P>Q. Why do you think &s;o?</P>
<P>A. I think the Re&s;olutions of Right will give them very lit|tle Concern, if they are never attempted to be carried into Prac|tice. The Colonies will probably con&s;ider them&s;elves in the &s;ame Situation, in that Re&s;pect, with <HI>Ireland;</HI> they know you claim the &s;ame Right with Regard to <HI>Ireland,</HI> but you never ex|erci&s;e it. And they may believe you never will exerci&s;e it in the Colonies, any more than in <HI>Ireland,</HI> unle&s;s on &s;ome very extraordinary Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Q. But who are to be the Judges of that extraordinary Occa|&s;ion? Is it not the Parliament?</P>
<P>A. Though the Parliament may judge of the Occa&s;ion, the People will think it can never exerci&s;e &s;uch Right, till Repre|&s;entatives from the Colonies are admitted into Parliament, and that whenever the Occa&s;ion ari&s;es, Repre&s;entatives will be ordered.</P>

Q. Did you never hear that <HI>Maryland,</HI> during the la&s;t War, had refu&s;ed to furni&s;h a Quota towards the common Defence?</P>
<P>A. <HI>Maryland</HI> has been much mi&s;repre&s;ented in that Matter. <HI>Maryland</HI> to my Knowledge, never refu&s;ed to contribute, or grant Aids to the Crown. The A&s;&s;emblies every Year, during the War, voted con&s;iderable Sums, and formed Bills to rai&s;e them. The Bills were, according to the Con&s;titution of that Province, &s;ent up to the Council, or Upper Hou&s;e, for Con|currence, that they might be pre&s;ented to the Governor, in order to be enacted into Laws. Unhappy Di&s;putes between the two Hou&s;es ari&s;ing, from the Defects of that Con&s;titution prin|cipally, rendered all the Bills but one or two abortive. The Proprietary's Council rejected them. It is true <HI>Maryland</HI> did not contribute its Proportion, but it was, in my Opinion, the Fault of the Government, not of the People.</P>
<P>Q. Was it not talked of in the other Provinces as a proper Mea&s;ure to apply to Parliament to compel them?</P>
<P>A. I have heard &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e; but as it was well known, that the People were not to blame, no &s;uch Application was ever made, nor any Step taken towards it.</P>
<P>Q. Was it not propo&s;ed at a public Meeting?</P>
<P>A. Not that I know of.</P>
<P>Q. Do you remember the aboli&s;hing of the Paper Currency in <HI>New-England,</HI> by Act of A&s;&s;embly?</P>
<P>A. I do remember its being aboli&s;hed, in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett'</HI>s <HI>Bay.</HI></P>
<P>Q. Was not the Lieutenant Governor <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> principally concerned in that Tran&s;action?</P>
<P>A. I have heard &s;o.</P>
<P>Q. Was it not at that Time a very unpopular Law?</P>
<P>A. I believe it might, though I can &s;ay little about it, as I lived at a Di&s;tance from that Province.</P>
<P>Q. Was not the Scarcity of Gold and Silver an Argument u&s;ed again&s;t aboli&s;hing the Paper'</P>
<P>A. I &s;uppo&s;e it was.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="010303_0015_0F7E737AC6A022F0">
Q. What is the pre&s;ent Opinion there of that Law? Is it as unpopular as it was at Fir&s;t?</P>
<P>A. I think it is not.</P>
<P>Q. Have not In&s;tructions from hence been &s;ometimes &s;ent over to Governors, highly oppre&s;&s;ive and unpolitical?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Have not &s;ome Governors di&s;pen&s;ed with them for that Rea&s;on?</P>
<P>A. Yes; I have heard &s;o.</P>
<P>Q. Did the <HI>Americans</HI> ever di&s;pute the controuling Power of Parliament to regulate the Commerce?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Can any thing le&s;s than a Military Force carry the Stamp-act into Execution?</P>
<P>A. I do not &s;ee how a Military Force can be applied to that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. Why may it not?</P>
<P>A. Suppo&s;e a Military Force &s;ent into <HI>America,</HI> they will find Nobody in Arms; What are they then to do? They cannot force a Man to take Stamps who choo&s;es to do without them. They will not find a Rebellion; they may indeed make one.</P>
<P>Q. If the Act is not repealed, what do you think will be the Con&s;equences?</P>
<P>A. A total Lo&s;s of the Re&s;pect and Affection the People of <HI>America</HI> bear to this Country, and of all the Commerce that de|pends on that Re&s;pect and Affection.</P>
<P>Q. How can the Commerce be affected?</P>
<P>A. You will find, that if the Act is not repealed, they will take very little of your Manufactures in a &s;hort Time.</P>
<P>Q. Is it in their Power to do without them.</P>
<P>A. I think they may very well do without them.</P>
<P>Q. Is it their Intere&s;t not to take them?</P>
<P>A. The Goods they take from <HI>Britain</HI> are either Nece&s;&s;aries, mere Conveniences, or Superfluities. The Fir&s;t, as Cloth, &amp;c. with a little Indu&s;try they can make at Home; the Second they can do without, till they are able to provide them among them|&s;elves;
<PB N="17" REF="010303_0016_0F7E737B587ABD28">
and the la&s;t, which are much the greate&s;t Part, they will &s;trike off immediately. They are mere Articles of Fa&s;hion, purcha&s;ed and con&s;umed, becau&s;e the Fa&s;hion in a re&s;pected Country, but will now be dete&s;ted and rejected. The People have already &s;truck off, by general Agreement, the u&s;e of all Goods fa&s;hionable in Mournings, and many Thou&s;and Pounds Worth are &s;ent back as un&s;aleable.</P>
<P>Q. Is it their Intere&s;t to make Cloth at Home?</P>
<P>A. I think they may at pre&s;ent get it cheaper from <HI>Britain.</HI> I mean of the &s;ame Finene&s;s and Neatne&s;s of Workman&s;hip; but when one con&s;iders other Circum&s;tances, the Re&s;traints on their Trade, and the Difficulty of making Remittances, it is their Intere&s;t to make every Thing.</P>
<P>Q. Suppo&s;e an Act of internal Regulations, connected with a Tax, how would they receive it?</P>
<P>A. I think it would be objected to.</P>
<P>Q. Then no Regulation with a Tax would be &s;ubmitted to?</P>
<P>A. Their Opinion is, that when Aids to the Crown are want|ed, they are to be a&s;ked of the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies, according to the old e&s;tabli&s;hed U&s;age, who will, as they always have done, grant them freely. And that their Money ought not to be given away without their Con&s;ent, by Per&s;ons at a Di&s;tance, unac|quainted with their Circum&s;tances and Abilities. The granting Aids to the Crown, is the only Means they have of recom|mending them&s;elves to their Sovereign, and they think it ex|tremely hard and unju&s;t, that a Body of Men, in which they have no Repre&s;entatives, &s;hould make a Merit to it&s;elf of giving and granting what is not its own, but theirs, and deprive them of a Right they e&s;teem of the utmo&s;t Value and Importance, as it is the Security of all their other Rights.</P>
<P>Q. But is not the Po&s;t-office, which they have long re|ceived, a Tax as well as a Regulation?</P>
<P>A. No; the Money paid for the Po&s;tage of a Letter is not of the Nature of a Tax; it is merely a Quantum Meruit for a Service done; no Per&s;on is compellable to pay the Money, if he does not chu&s;e to receive the Service. A Man may &s;till,
<PB N="18" REF="010303_0017_0F7E737DAD180588">
as before the Act, &s;end his Letter by a Servant, a &s;pecial Me&s;&s;enger, or a Friend, if he thinks it cheaper and &s;afer.</P>
<P>Q. But do they not con&s;ider the Regulations of the Po&s;t-office, by the Act of la&s;t Year, as a Tax?</P>
<P>A. By the Regulations of la&s;t Year the Rate of Po&s;tage was generally abated near thirty <HI>per Cent.</HI> through all <HI>America;</HI> they certainly cannot con&s;ider &s;uch Abatement as a Tax.</P>
<P>Q. If an Exci&s;e was laid by Parliament, which they might likewi&s;e avoid paying, by not con&s;uming the Articles exci&s;ed, would they then not object to it?</P>
<P>A. They would certainly object to it, as an Exci&s;e is uncon|nected with any Service done, and is merely an Aid which they think ought to be a&s;ked of them, and granted by them, if they are to pay it, and can be granted for them by no others what&s;oever, whom they have not impowered for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Q. You &s;ay they do not object to the Right of Parliament in laying Duties on Goods to be paid on their Importation; now, is there any kind of Difference between a Duty on the Impor|tation of Goods, and an Exci&s;e, on their Con&s;umption?</P>
<P>A. Yes; a very material one; an Exci&s;e, for the Rea&s;ons I have ju&s;t mentioned, they think you can have no Right to lay within their Country. But the Sea is yours; you maintain, by your Fleets, the Safety of Navigation in it; and keep it clear of Pirates; you may have therefore a natural and equitable Right to &s;ome Toll or Duty on Merchandizes carried through that Part of your Dominions, towards defraying the Expence you are at in Ships to maintain the Safety of that Carriage.</P>
<P>Q. Does this Rea&s;oning hold in the Ca&s;e of a Duty laid on the Produce of their Lands exported? and would they not then object to &s;uch a Duty?</P>
<P>A. If it tended to make the Produce &s;o much dearer Abroad as to le&s;&s;en the Demand for it, to be &s;ure they would object to &s;uch a Duty; not to your Right of laying it, but they would complain of it as a Burthen, and petition you to lighten it.</P>
<P>Q. Is not the Duty paid on the Tobacco exported a Duty of that Kind?</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010303_0018_0F7E737E915EBF30">
A. That, I think, is only on Tobacco carried coa&s;twi&s;e from one Colony to another, and appropriated as a Fund for &s;up|porting the College at <HI>William&s;burg,</HI> in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>Q. Have not the A&s;&s;emblies in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> the &s;ame natu|ral Rights with tho&s;e in <HI>North America?</HI></P>
<P>A. Undoubtedly.</P>
<P>Q. And is there not a Tax laid there on their Sugars ex|ported?</P>
<P>A. I am not much acquanted with the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> but the Duty of four and a half <HI>per Cent.</HI> on Sugars exported, was, I believe, granted by their own A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Q. How much is the Poll-Tax in your Province laid on unmarried Men?</P>
<P>A. It is, I think, Fifteen Shillings, to be paid by every &s;in|gle Freeman, upwards of twenty-one Years old.</P>
<P>Q. What is the annual Amount of all the Taxes in <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania?</HI></P>
<P>A. I &s;uppo&s;e about 20,000 Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>Q. Suppo&s;ing the Stamp-act continued, and enforced, do you imagine that ill Humour will induce the <HI>Americans</HI> to give as much for wor&s;e Manufactures of their own, and u&s;e them, preferable to better of ours.</P>
<P>A. Yes, I think &s;o. People will pay as freely to gratify one Pa&s;&s;ion as another, their Re&s;entment as their Pride.</P>
<P>Q. Would the People at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> di&s;continue their Trade?</P>
<P>A. The Merchants are a very &s;mall Number, compared with the Body of the People, and mu&s;t di&s;continue their Trade, if Nobody will buy their Goods.</P>
<P>Q. What are the Body of the People in the Colonies?</P>
<P>A. They are Farmers, Hu&s;bandmen or Planters.</P>
<P>Q. Would they &s;uffer the Produce of their Lands to rot?</P>
<P>A. No; but they would not rai&s;e &s;o much. They would manufacture more, and plough le&s;s.</P>
<P>Q. Would they live without the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in civil Matters, and &s;uffer all the Inconveniences of &s;uch a Situation for any con&s;iderable Time, rather than take the

Stamps, &s;uppo&s;ing the Stamps were protected by a &s;ufficient Force, where every one might have them?</P>
<P>A. I think the Suppo&s;ition impracticable, that the Stamps &s;hould be &s;o protected as that every one might have them. The Act requires Sub-di&s;tributors to be appointed in every County Town, Di&s;trict and Village, and they would be nece&s;|&s;ary. But the principal Di&s;tributors, who were to have had a con&s;iderable Profit on the Whole, have not thought it worth while to continue in the Office, and I think it impo&s;&s;ible to find Sub-di&s;tributors fit to be tru&s;ted, who, for the trifling Profit that mu&s;t come to their Share, would incur the Odium, and run the Hazard that would attend it; and if they could be found, I think it impracticable to protect the Stamps in &s;o ma|ny di&s;tant and remote Places.</P>
<P>Q. But in Places where they could be protected, would not the People u&s;e them rather than remain in &s;uch a Situation, unable to obtain any Right, or recover, by Law, any Debt?</P>
<P>A. It is hard to &s;ay what they would do. I can only judge what other People will think, and how they will act by what I feel within my&s;elf. I have a great many Debts due to me in <HI>America,</HI> and I had rather they &s;hould remain unrecoverable by any Law, than &s;ubmit to the Stamp-act. They will be Debts of Honour. It is my Opinion the People will either continue in that Situation, or find &s;ome way to extricate them|selves, perhaps by generally agreeing to proceed in the Courts without Stamps.</P>
<P>Q. What do you think a &s;ufficient military Force to protect the Di&s;tribution of the Stamps in every Part of <HI>America?</HI></P>
<P>A. A very great Force; I can't &s;ay what, if the Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>America</HI> is for a general Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Q. What is the Number of Men in <HI>America</HI> able to bear Arms, or of di&s;ciplined Militia?</P>

<P>Q. Is the <HI>American</HI> Stamp-act an equal Tax on that Country?</P>
<P>A. I think not.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="010303_0020_0F7E737FE1E5E6F8">
Q. Why &s;o?</P>
<P>A. The greate&s;t Part of the Money mu&s;t ari&s;e from Law Suits for the Recovery of Debts, and be paid by the lower Sort of People, who were too poor ea&s;ily to pay their Debts. It is therefore a heavy Tax on the Poor, and a Tax upon them for being poor.</P>
<P>Q. But will not this Increa&s;e of Expence be a Means of le&s;&s;ening the Number of Law Suits;</P>
<P>A. I think not; for as the Co&s;ts fall all upon the Debtor, and are to be paid by him, they would be no Di&s;couragement to the Creditor to bring his Action.</P>
<P>Q. Would it not have the Effect of exce&s;&s;ive U&s;ury?</P>
<P>A. Yes, as an Oppre&s;&s;ion of the Debtor.</P>
<P>Q. How many Ships are there laden annually in <HI>North-America</HI> with Flax-&s;eed for <HI>Ireland?</HI></P>
<P>A. I cannot &s;peak to the Number of Ships, but I know that in 1752, 10,000 Hog&s;heads of Flax-&s;eed, each containing 7 Bu&s;hels, were exported from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Ireland.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e the Quantity is greatly increa&s;ed &s;ince that Time; and it is un|der&s;tood that the Exportation from <HI>New-York</HI> is equal to that from <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>

Q. If the Stamp-Act &s;hould be repealed, would not the <HI>Ame|ricans</HI> think they could oblige the Parliament to repeal every ex|ternal Tax Law now in Force?</P>
<P>A. It is hard to an&s;wer Que&s;tions of what People at &s;uch a Di&s;tance will think.</P>
<P>Q. But what do you imagine they will think were the Mo|tives of repealing the Act?</P>
<P>A. I &s;uppo&s;e they will think that it was repealed from a Con|viction of its Inexpediency; and they will rely upon it, that while the &s;ame Inexpediency &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, you will never attempt to make &s;uch another.</P>
<P>Q. What do you mean by its Inexpediency?</P>
<P>A. I mean its Inexpediency on &s;everal Accounts; the Po|verty and Inability of tho&s;e who were to pay the Tax; the ge|neral Di&s;content it has occa&s;ioned; and the Impracticability of enforcing it.</P>
<P>Q. If the Act &s;hould be repealed, and the Legi&s;lature &s;hould &s;hew its Re&s;entment to the Oppo&s;ers of the Stamp-Act, would the Colonies acquie&s;ce in the Authority of the Legi&s;lature? What is your Opinion they would do?</P>

It was accordingly recommended to Parliament, in the mo&s;t honourable Manner, for them. <HI>America</HI> has been greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented and abu&s;ed here, in Pa|pers, and Pamphlets, and Speeches, as ungrateful and unrea&s;on|able, and unju&s;t, in having put this Nation to immen&s;e Expence for their Defence, and refu&s;ing to bear any Part of that Expence. The Colonies rai&s;ed, paid and clothed, near 25000 Men during the la&s;t War, a Number equal to tho&s;e &s;ent from <HI>Britain,</HI> and far beyond their Proportion; they went deeply into Debt in doing this, and all their Taxes and E&s;tates are mortgaged, for many Years to come, for di&s;charging that Debt. Government here was at that Time very &s;en&s;ible of this. The Colonies were recommended to Parliament. Every Year the King &s;ent down to the Hou&s;e a written Me&s;&s;age to this Purpo&s;e.

This is the &s;tronge&s;t of all Proofs that the Co|lonies, far from being unwilling to bear a Share of the Burthen, did exceed their Proportion; for if they had done le&s;s, or had only equalled their Proportion, there would have been no Room or Rea&s;on for Compen&s;ation.&mdash;Indeed the Sums reimbur&s;ed them, were by no Means adequate to the Expence they incurred beyond their Proportion; but they never murmured at that; they e&s;teemed their Sovereign's Approbation of their Zeal and Fidelity, and the Approbation of this Hou&s;e, far beyond any other Kind of Compen&s;ation; therefore there was no Occa&s;ion for this Act, to force Money from a willing People; they had not refu&s;ed giving Money for the Purpo&s;es of the Act; no Re|qui&s;ition had been made; they were always willing and ready to do what could rea&s;onably be expected from them, and in this Light they wi&s;h to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Q. But &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;hould be engaged in a War in <HI>Europe,</HI> would <HI>North-America</HI> contribute to the Support of it?</P>
<P>A. I do think they would, as far as their Circum&s;tances would permit. They con&s;ider them&s;elves as a Part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Em|pire, and as having one common Intere&s;t with it; they may be looked on here as Foreigners, but they do not con&s;ider them|&s;elves as &s;uch. They are zealous for the Honour and Pro&s;pe|rity of this Nation, and, while they are well u&s;ed, will always be ready to &s;upport it, as far as their little Power goes. In 1739 they were called upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Expedition again&s;t <HI>Carthagena,</HI> and they &s;ent 3000 Men to join your Army. It is true <HI>Carthagena</HI> is in <HI>America,</HI> but as remote from the Northern Colonies, as if it had been in <HI>Europe.</HI> They make no Di&s;tinction of Wars, as to their Duty of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in them. I know the la&s;t War is commonly &s;poke of here as entered into for the Defence, or for the Sake of the People of <HI>America.</HI> I think it is quite mi&s;under&s;tood. It began about the Limits be|tween. <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> about Territories to which the Crown indeed laid Claim, but were not claimed by any <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>

Colony; none of the Lands had been granted to any Coloni&s;t; we had therefore no particular Concern or Intere&s;t in that Di&s;|pute. As to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> the Conte&s;t there began about your Right of trading in the <HI>Indian</HI> Country, a Right you had by the Treaty of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> infringed; they &s;eized the Traders and their Goods, which were your Manufactures; they took a Fort which a Company of your Merchants, and their Factors and Corre&s;pondents, had erected there, to &s;ecure that Trade. <HI>Braddock</HI> was &s;ent with an Army to re-take that Fort (which was looked on here as another Incroachment on the King's Territory) and to protect your Trade. It was not till after his Defeat that the Colonies were attacked. They were before in perfect Peace with both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians;</HI> the Troops were not therefore &s;ent for their Defence. The Trade with the <HI>Indians,</HI> though carried on in <HI>America,</HI> is not an <HI>American</HI> Inte|re&s;t. The People of <HI>America</HI> are chiefly Farmers and Planters; &s;carce any Thing that they rai&s;e or produce is an Article of Com|merce with the <HI>Indians.</HI> The <HI>Indian</HI> Trade is a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t; it is carried on with <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures, for the Profit of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants and Manufacturers; therefore the War, as it commenced for the Defence of Territories of the Crown, the Property of no <HI>American,</HI> and for the Defence of a Trade purely <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> was really a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> War&mdash;and yet the People of <HI>Ame|rica</HI> made no Scruple of contributing their utmo&s;t towards carry|ing it on, and bringing it to a happy Conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Q. Do you think then that the taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King's territorial Rights, and &s;trengthening the Frontiers, is not an <HI>American</HI> Intere&s;t?</P>
<P>A. Not particularly, but conjointly a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and an <HI>Ameri|can</HI> Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Q. You will not deny that the preceding War, the War with <HI>Spain,</HI> was entered into for the Sake of <HI>America;</HI> was it not occa&s;ioned by Captures made in the <HI>American</HI> Seas?</P>
<P>A. Yes; Captures of Slips carrying on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade there, with <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures.</P>

Q. Was not the late War with the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;ince the Peace with <HI>France,</HI> a War for <HI>America</HI> only?</P>
<P>A. Yes; it was more particularly for <HI>America</HI> than the former, but it was rather a Con&s;equence or Remains of the former War, the <HI>Indians</HI> not having been thoroughly pacified, and the <HI>Ameri|cans</HI> bore by much the greate&s;t Share of the Expence. It was put an End to by the Army under General <HI>Bouquet;</HI> there were not above 300 Regulars in that Army, and above 1000 <HI>Penn&s;yl|vanians.</HI></P>
<P>Q. Is it not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end Troops to <HI>America,</HI> to defend the <HI>Americans</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Indians?</HI></P>
<P>A. No, by no Means; it never was nece&s;&s;ary. They defend|ed them&s;elves when they were but an Handful, and the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> much more numerous. They continually gained Ground, and have driven the <HI>Indians</HI> over the Mountains, without any Troops &s;ent to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance from this Country. And can it be thought nece&s;&s;ary now to &s;end Troops for their Defence from tho&s;e dimini&s;hed <HI>Indian</HI> Tribes, when the Colonies are become &s;o populous, and &s;o &s;trong? There is not the lea&s;t Oc|ca&s;ion for it; they are very able to defend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Q. Do you &s;ay there were no more than 300 Regular Troops employed in the late <HI>Indian</HI> War?</P>
<P>A. Not on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> or the Frontiers of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> which was the chief Part of the War that affected the Colonies. There were Garri&s;ons at <HI>Niagara,</HI> Fort <HI>Detroit,</HI> and tho&s;e re|mote Po&s;ts kept for the Sake of your Trade; I did not reckon them, but I believe that on the whole the Number of <HI>Americans,</HI> or provincial Troops, employed in the War, was greater than that of the Regulars. I am not certain, but I think &s;o.</P>
<P>Q. Do you think the A&s;&s;emblies have a Right to levy Mo|ney on the Subject there, to grant to the Crown?</P>
<P>A. I certainly think &s;o; they have always done it.</P>
<P>Q. Are they acquainted with the Declaration of Rights? and do they know that, by that Statute, Money is not to be rai&s;ed on the Subject but by Con&s;ent of Parliament?</P>
<P>A. They are very well acquainted with it.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="010303_0026_0F7E7386B63BB678">
Q. How then can they think they have a Right to levy Mo|ney for the Crown, or for any other than local Purpo&s;es?</P>
<P>A. They under&s;tand that Clau&s;e to relate to Subjects only within the Realm; that no Money can be levied on them for the Crown, but by Con&s;ent of Parliament. The Colonies are not &s;uppo&s;ed to be within the Realm; they have A&s;&s;emblies of their own, which are their Parliaments, and they are in that Re&s;pect in the &s;ame Situation with <HI>Ireland.</HI> When Money is to be rai&s;ed for the Crown upon the Subject in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or in the Colonies, the Con&s;ent is given in the Parliament of <HI>Ireland,</HI> or in the A&s;&s;emblies of the Colonies. They think the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> cannot properly give that Con&s;ent till it has Re|pre&s;entatives from <HI>America;</HI> for the Petition of Right expre&s;sly &s;ays, it is to be by common Con&s;ent in Parliament, and the People of <HI>America</HI> have no Repre&s;entatives in Parliament, to make a Part of that common Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Q. If the Stamp-act &s;hould be repealed, and an Act &s;hould pa&s;s, ordering the A&s;&s;emblies of the Colonies to indemnify the Sufferers by the Riots, would they obey it?</P>
<P>A. That is a Que&s;tion I cannot an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Q. Suppo&s;e the King &s;hould require the Colonies to grant a Revenue, and the Parliament &s;hould be again&s;t their doing it, do they think they can grant a Revenue to the King, without the Con&s;ent of the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain?</HI></P>
<P>A. That is a deep Que&s;tion.&mdash;As to my own Opinion, I &s;hould think my&s;elf at Liberty to do it, and &s;hould do it, if I liked the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Q. When Money has been rai&s;ed in the Colonies upon Re|qui&s;itions, has it not been granted to the King?</P>
<P>A. Yes, always; but the Requi&s;itions have generally been for &s;ome Service expre&s;&s;ed, as to rai&s;e, clothe and pay Troops, and not for Money only.</P>
<P>Q. If the Act &s;hould pa&s;s, requiring the <HI>American</HI> A&s;&s;emblies to make Compen&s;ation to the Sufferers, and they &s;hould di&s;obey it, and then the Parliament &s;hould, by another Act, lay an in|ternal Tax, would they then obey it?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="010303_0027_0F7E73875ADEA980">
A. The People will pay no internal Tax; and I think an Act to oblige the A&s;&s;emblies to make Compen&s;ation is unnece&s;&s;ary, for I am of Opinion, that as &s;oon as the pre&s;ent Heats are abated, they will take the Matter into Con&s;ideration, and, if it is right to be done, they will do it of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Q. Do not Letters often come into the Po&s;t-Offices in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> directed to &s;ome inland Town where no Po&s;t goes?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Can any private Per&s;on take up tho&s;e Letters, and carry them as directed?</P>
<P>A. Yes, any Friend of the Per&s;on may do it, paying the Po&s;t|age that has occurred?</P>
<P>Q. But mu&s;t he not pay an additional Po&s;tage for the Di&s;tance to &s;uch inland Town?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P>Q. Can the Po&s;t-Ma&s;ter an&s;wer delivering the Letter, with|out being paid &s;uch additional Po&s;tage?</P>
<P>A. Certainly he can demand nothing where he does no Service.</P>
<P>Q. Suppo&s;e a Per&s;on, being far from Home, finds a Letter in a Po&s;t-Office directed to him, and he lives in a Place to which the Po&s;t generally goes, and the Letter is directed to that Place, will the Po&s;t-Ma&s;ter deliver him the Letter without his paying the Po&s;tage receivable at the Place to which the Letter is direct|ed?</P>
<P>A. Yes; the Office cannot demand Po&s;tage for a Letter that it does not carry, or farther than it does carry it.</P>
<P>Q. Are not Ferrymen in <HI>America</HI> obliged by Act of Parlia|ment, to carry over the Po&s;ts without Pay?</P>
<P>A. Yes.</P>
<P>Q. Is not this a Tax on the Ferrymen?</P>
<P>A. They do not con&s;ider it as &s;uch, as they have an Advan|tage from Per&s;ons travelling with the Po&s;t.</P>
<P>Q. If the Stamp-Act &s;hould be repealed, and the Crown &s;hould make a Requi&s;ition to the Colonies for a Sum of Money, would they grant it?</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="010303_0028_0F7E73881C3B8618">
A. I believe they would.</P>
<P>Q. Why do you think &s;o?</P>
<P>A. I can &s;peak for the Colony I live in; I had it in In&s;tructi|on from the A&s;&s;embly to a&s;&s;ure the Mini&s;try, that as they always had done, &s;o they &s;hould always think it their Duty to grant &s;uch Aids to the Crown as were &s;uitable to their Circum|&s;tances and Abilities, whenever called upon for the Purpo&s;e, in the u&s;ual con&s;titutional Manner; and I had the Honour of com|municating this In&s;truction to that Honourable Gentleman then Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Q. Would they do this for a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Concern; as &s;uppo&s;e a War in &s;ome Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> that did not affect them?</P>
<P>A. Yes, for any Thing that concerned the general Intere&s;t. They con&s;ider them&s;elves as a Part of the Whole.</P>
<P>Q. What is the u&s;ual con&s;titutional Manner of calling on the Colonies for Aids?</P>
<P>A. A Letter from the Secretary of State.</P>
<P>Q. Is this all you mean, a Letter from the Secretary of State?</P>
<P>A. I mean the u&s;ual Way of Requi&s;ition, in a circular Letter from the Secretary of State, by his Maje&s;ty's Command, reciting the Occa&s;ion, and recommending it to the Colonies to grant &s;uch Aids as became their Loyalty, and were &s;uitable to their Abilities.</P>
<P>Q. Did the Secretary of State ever write for Money for the Crown?</P>
<P>A. The Requi&s;itions have been to rai&s;e, clothe and pay Men, which cannot be done without Money.</P>
<P>Q. Would they grant Money alone, if called on?</P>
<P>A. In my Opinion they would, Money as well as Men, when they have Money, or can make it.</P>
<P>Q. If the Parliament &s;hould repeal the Stamp-Act, will the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> re&s;cind their Re&s;olutions?</P>
<P>A. I think not.</P>
<P>Q. Before there was any Thought of the Stamp-act, did they wi&s;h for a Repre&s;entation in Parliament?</P>
<P>A. No.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="010303_0029_0F7E7388DA278E80">
Q. Don't you know that there is in the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> Charter, an expre&s;s Re&s;ervation of the Right of Parliament to lay Taxes there?</P>
<P>A. I know there is a Clau&s;e in the Charter, by which the King grants that he will levy no Taxes on the Inhabitants, unle&s;s it be with the Con&s;ent of the A&s;&s;embly, or by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>Q. How then could the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> a&s;&s;ert, that laying a Tax on them by the Stamp-act was an Infringement of their Rights?</P>
<P>A. They under&s;tand it thus; by the &s;ame Charter, and o|therwi&s;e, they are intitled to all the Privileges and Liberties of <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> they find in the great Charters, and the Petition and Declaration of Rights, that one of the Privileges of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects is, that they are not to be taxed but by their common Con&s;ent; they have therefore relied upon it, from the fir&s;t Set|tlement of the Province, that the Parliament never would, nor could, by Colour of that Clau&s;e in the Charter, a&s;&s;ume a Right of taxing them, till it had qualified it&s;elf to exerci&s;e &s;uch Right, by admitting Repre&s;entatives from the People to be taxed, who ought to make a Part of that common Con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Q. Are there any Words in the Charter that ju&s;tify that Con|&s;truction?</P>
<P>A. The common Rights of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> as declared by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and the Petition of Right, all ju&s;tify it.</P>
<P>Q. Does the Di&s;tinction between internal and external Taxes exi&s;t in the Words of the Charter?</P>
<P>A. No, I believe not.</P>
<P>Q. Then may they not, by the &s;ame Interpretation, object to the Parliament's Right of external Taxation?</P>
<P>A. They never have hitherto. Many Arguments have been lately u&s;ed here to &s;hew them that there is no Difference, and that if you have no Right to tax them internally, you have none to tax them externally, or make any other Law to bind them. At pre&s;ent they do not rea&s;on &s;o, but in Time they may po&s;&s;ibly be convinced by the&s;e Arguments.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="010303_0030_0F7E7389E3485D28">
Q. Do not the Re&s;olutions of the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> A&s;&s;embly &s;ay all Taxes?</P>
<P>A. If they do, they mean only internal Taxes; the &s;ame Words have not always the &s;ame Meaning here and in the Colo|nies. By Taxes they mean internal Taxes; by Duties they mean Cu&s;toms; the&s;e are their Ideas of the Language.</P>
<P>Q. Have you not &s;een the Re&s;olutions of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay</HI> A&s;&s;embly?</P>
<P>A. I have.</P>
<P>Q. Do they not &s;ay, that neither external nor internal Taxes can be laid on them by Parliament?</P>
<P>A. I don't know that they do; I believe not.</P>
<P>Q. If the &s;ame Colony &s;hould &s;ay neither Tax nor Impo&s;ition could be laid, does not that Province hold the Power of Parlia|ment can hold neither?</P>
<P>A. I &s;uppo&s;e that by the Word Impo&s;ition, they do not in|tend to expre&s;s Duties to be laid on Goods imported, as Regu|lations of Commerce.</P>
<P>Q. What can the Colonies mean then by Impo&s;ition as di&s;tinct from Taxes?</P>
<P>A. They may mean many Things, as impre&s;&s;ing of Men, or of Carriages, quartering Troops on private Hou&s;es, and the like; there may be great Impo&s;itions, that are not properly Taxes.</P>
<P>Q. Is not the Po&s;t-Office Rate an internal Tax laid by Act of Parliament?</P>
<P>A. I have an&s;wered that.</P>
<P>Q. Are all Parts of the Colonies equally able to pay Taxes?</P>
<P>A. No, certainly; the Frontier Parts, which have been ra|vaged by the Enemy, are greatly di&s;abled by that Means, and therefore, in &s;uch Ca&s;es, are u&s;ually favoured in our Tax Laws.</P>
<P>Q. Can we, at this Di&s;tance, be competent Judges of what Favours are nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>A. The Parliamentar have &s;uppo&s;ed it, by claiming a Right to make Tax Laws for <HI>America:</HI> I think it impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="010303_0031_0F7E738CDA41F450">
Q. Would the Repeal of the Stamp-Act be any Di&s;courage|ment of your Manufactures? Will the People that have begun to manufacture decline it?</P>
<P>A. Yes, I think they will; e&s;pecially if, at the &s;ame Time, the Trade is opened again, &s;o that Remittances can be ea&s;ily made. I have known &s;everal In&s;tances that make it probable. In the War before la&s;t, Tobacco being low, and making little Remittance, the People of <HI>Virginia</HI> went generally into Family Manufactures. Afterwards, when Tobacco bore a better Price, they returned to the U&s;e of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures. So fulling Mills were very much di&s;u&s;ed in the la&s;t War in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> becau&s;e Bills were then plenty, and Remittances could ea&s;ily be made to <HI>Britain</HI> for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth and other Goods.</P>
<P>Q. If the Stamp-Act &s;hould be repealed, would it induce the A&s;&s;emblies of <HI>America</HI> to acknowledge the Rights of Parliament to tax them, and would they era&s;e their Re&s;olutions?</P>
<P>A. No, never.</P>
<P>Q. Is there no Means of obliging them to era&s;e tho&s;e Re&s;olu|tions?</P>
<P>A. None that I know of; they will never do it unle&s;s com|pelled by Force of Arms.</P>
<P>Q. Is there a Power on Earth that can force them to era&s;e them?</P>
<P>A. No Power, how great &s;oever, can force Men to change their Opinions.</P>
<P>Q. Do they con&s;ider the Po&s;t-Office as a Tax, or as a Regu|lation?</P>
<P>A. Not as a Tax, but as a Regulation and Conveniency; every A&s;&s;embly encouraged it, and &s;upported it in its Infancy, by Grants of Money, which they would not otherwi&s;e have done; and the People have always paid the Po&s;tage.</P>
<P>Q. When did you receive the In&s;tructions you mentioned?</P>
<P>A. I brought them with me, when I came to <HI>England,</HI> about 15 Months &s;ince.</P>
<P>Q. When did you communicate that In&s;truction to the Mi|ni&s;ter?</P>
