<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s which my former narrative met with, which was merely an ex|tract from a Journal kept for my own amu&s;e|ment, has induced me to lay before the public a more copious detail of that work.</P>
<P>Various errors in the former edition are in this corrected,&mdash;and large additions made, with &s;uch improvements as mu&s;t render the work more exten&s;ively u&s;eful, as well as entertaining to readers of all cla&s;&s;es. I have been more particular in the Geographical de&s;cription of the &s;everal places, in this edition than I was in the la&s;t, particularly of Algiers and Oran.</P>
<P>The importance as well as utility of having a work of this kind generally di&s;&s;eminated through the United States, mu&s;t be apparent to every thinking per&s;on. The &s;uffering of our fellow-citizens, in Algiers were great in|deed! They ought not to be too ea&s;ily forgot|ten.</P>
<P><PB REF="033747_0003_0FF915EB47927A00">
Every &s;tep to avoid a repetition of them will undoubtedly be pur&s;ued. But &s;hould, at any future period, from cau&s;es not &s;een, more Americans be doomed to wear the galling chain, (God grant that period may never ar|rive) a knowledge of the habits, manners, and cu&s;toms of the place, may not be un&s;erviceable.</P>
<P>From the tender and feeling &s;oul, a peru&s;al of the following pages, mu&s;t call forth the tear of &s;ympathy. The hard&s;hips&mdash;the &s;ufferings&mdash;the agonizing tortures, which our fellow-citi|zens had to endure, while groaning under all the horrors of Mahometan va&s;&s;alage, of Alge|rine tyranny, mu&s;t call into action every ten|der &s;igh! and virgin drops of pity embalm the memory of tho&s;e who&s;e fate it was to &s;ink un|der the weight of their accumulated woes.&mdash;Alas! they're gone&mdash;</P>
<L><HI>Nor heed they, more with angui&s;h and with pain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The goad terrific&mdash;or the galling chain.</HI></L>
<P>Some of my de&s;criptions of the treatment of the Captives may appear rather wire-drawn, but then my readers ought to be informed that the&s;e mercile&s;s Barbarians are taught by their
<PB REF="033747_0004_0FF915F2A5FE7890">
religion to treat the Chri&s;tian Captives with unexampled cruelty, and that in &s;o doing they do God &s;ervice! Hence to expect pity or com|mi&s;eration from tho&s;e &s;ons of I&s;hmael would be as ab&s;urd, as to expect a &s;hrubery from the burning de&s;erts, or cooling &s;treams from the parched plains of Arabia.</P>
<P>All the poor, forlorn, mi&s;erable Captive has to do, is to re&s;ign him&s;elf up to his fate, and in &s;ilence wait the event.</P>
<P>As the following is the production of one who&s;e literary advantages have been but &s;mall and who&s;e opportunities of improvement have been limited, he humbly hopes, the humane &amp; candid reader will pa&s;s over &s;uch errors as may not have been di&s;covered: And further hopes that their patronage may be afforded to the ju|venile efforts of one, who for a long time, had to &s;uffer the galling chains of Slavery.</P>
<P>As &s;ome may inquire what opportunities could be obtained for writing a journal under &s;uch &s;evere captivity; I would here ob&s;erve that I wrote in the night, while in the <HI>Bagnio</HI> or pri&s;on, after our daily labour was over, the prin|cipal events of the day, merely to amuse &amp; re|lieve
<PB REF="033747_0005_0FF915FA6EAFF720">
my mind from the di&s;mal reflections which naturally occurred&mdash;that I could have no inducement to exaggerate our &s;ufferings not &s;uppo&s;ing my narrative would ever be &s;een here&mdash;the&s;e circum&s;tances being known, I flat|ter my&s;elf the facts herein &s;tated will not of|ten be called in que&s;tion.&mdash;</P>
<P>But &s;hould the truth of any thing &s;tated in the following pages be called in que&s;tion, am|ple te&s;timony can be procured in &s;upport of e|very thing here advanced, from tho&s;e of my unfortunate fellow captives who&s;e veracity is known and unque&s;tionable.</P>
<P>Sincerely wi&s;hing that none of my fellow-citizens may ever be &s;o unhappy as to experi|ence the mi&s;eries of Algerine &s;lavery, I again commend the following pages, to their candour and patronage.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I&s;t. Containing my departure from Newburyport, ar|rival at Baltimore, departure from thence, Capture by the Algerines, treatment received from them.&mdash;The common labour and u&s;age of the Chri&s;tian Cap|tives.</HEAD>
<P>ON Saturday the 27th of July 1793, I &s;ailed from Newburyport in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in the capacity of a Mariner, on board the Brig Polly, belonging to the a|bove mentioned place, Samuel E. Bayley, Ma&s;|ter, bound to Baltimore, in the State of Ma|ryland, expecting to take freight from thence for the I&s;land of Tobago.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day the 6th of Augu&s;t, we were brought too by a French privateer, and per|mitted immediately to proceed on our voyage. Being then in &s;ight of the Capes of Virginia, we took on board a Pilot and &s;tood in for the Che&s;apeak.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day the 7th of Augu&s;t, we entered the Capes and were 'till Saturday the 10th, before we arrived at Baltimore; and found,
<PB N="8" REF="033747_0007_0FF91604219D9358">
on our arrival, that the freight, which Capt. Bayley expected, was embarked and &s;ailed on board another ve&s;&s;el. Nothing particular hap|pened, until Monday the 19th when we were ordered by the Captain to di&s;charge the balla&s;t, and were informed by him that he had agreed to take a freight for Cadiz.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day the 29th, <HI>Paul Noyes,</HI> one of our mariners, was attacked with a &s;evere fever, and continued on board until Monday, the 9th of September, when he was carried on &s;hore, and put under the care of a woman, well qual|ified for attending &s;ick people. I under&s;tand he died in a few days after our departure.&mdash;Tue&s;day the 10th we &s;ailed from Baltimore, bound to Cadiz; and on Friday the 13th we left &s;ight of the Capes of Virginia. Nothing of any great moment occurred, until Thur&s;day the 24th of October, when we fell in with and &s;poke two Brigs from El&s;inore, bound to Barcelona. On Friday, the 25th, early in the morning we &s;aw the &s;ame Brigs about two miles to windward, &s;tanding on their larboard tack, with the wind about E. N. E.</P>
<P>We got our breakfa&s;t, and ate it in the great|e&s;t jollity, not apprehending any danger nigh, expecting to reach the port of de&s;tination within 48 hours; As we judged our&s;elves to be about 35 leagues we&s;tward of Cape St. Vin|cent. But what a fatal day was this! How vi&s;ionary our hopes! Our &s;prightly looks, and cheerful congratulations, and anticipations of reaching the port of our de&s;tination was &s;oon
<PB N="9" REF="033747_0008_0FF9160BD7CB0C98">
turned into the mo&s;t gloomy de&s;pair. Little did we think in the morning when we aro&s;e with nothing before us but Liberty and con|tent, that before the Sun &s;hould reach his me|ridian altitude, we &s;hould be &s;laves to merci|le&s;s <HI>Barbarians.</HI> This however, was the ca&s;e, For at 9 A. M. we &s;aw a &s;trange &s;ail bearing a|bout E. N. E. and &s;tanding directly for the two Dani&s;h Brigs. We then di&s;covered (with a pro&s;pect Gla&s;s) that &s;he had boarded them; and that &s;he had the Engli&s;h Flag di&s;played at her peak. We then &s;uppo&s;ed her to be an Engli&s;h Privateer. She &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, and bore down upon us. By this time we could &s;ee that &s;he was a Brig; and di&s;cerned by the cut of her &s;ails, that &s;he was not an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, although &s;he had &s;till the Engli&s;h &s;lag flying; we then &s;uppo&s;ed her to be a French Privateer, hoi&s;ting the Engli&s;h flag to deceive their enemy. We immediately clued down topgallant &s;ails, and hove too in order to wait 'till &s;he came along &s;ide. When &s;he came near enough to make us hear, &s;he hailed us in Engli&s;h, a&s;ked from whence we came, and where bound; which was immediately an&s;|wered by Capt. Bayley. The man who hailed us, was dre&s;&s;ed in the Chri&s;tian habit, and was the only per&s;on we could yet &s;ee on her deck; By this time, the Brig was under our &s;tern; we then &s;aw &s;everal men jump upon her poop, to hall aft the main &s;heet, and &s;aw by their dre&s;s and long beards that they were Moors, or Al|gerines. Our feelings at this unwelcome
<PB N="10" REF="033747_0009_0FF9161327659240">
&s;ight, are more ea&s;ily imagined than de&s;cribed. What dreadful perturbations! to e&s;cape was impo&s;&s;ible; weapons of defence, we had none, we mu&s;t therefore re&s;ign our&s;elves to the mer|cy of piratical &s;ea-rovers. She then hove too under our lee, when we heard a mo&s;t terrible &s;houting, clapping of hands, huzzaing &amp;c.&mdash;And &s;aw a great number of men ri&s;e up with their heads above the gunnel, dre&s;&s;ed in the Turki&s;h habit like them we &s;aw on the poop. They immediately hoi&s;ted out a large launch, and about one hundred of the pirates jumped on board, all armed; &s;ome with Scymitres and Pi&s;tols, others with pikes, &s;pears, lances, knives, &amp;c. They manned about 20 oars and rowed along &s;ide. As &s;oon as they came on board our ve&s;&s;el, they made &s;igns for us all to go forward, a&s;&s;uring us in &s;everal languages, that if we did not obey their commands, they would immediately ma&s;&s;acre us all. They then went below into the cabin, &s;teerage, and every place where they could get below deck, and broke open all the Trunks, and Che&s;ts, there were on board, and plundered all our bedding, cloathing, books, Charts, Quadrants, and every moveable article, that did not con|&s;i&s;t of the Cargo, or furniture. They then came on deck, like a parcel of ravenous wolves and &s;tripped the cloaths off our backs, all ex|cept a &s;hirt and pair of drawers, (my&s;elf being left with no &s;hirt at all.) The next day an old Turk, with an air of kindne&s;s, gave me an old &s;hirt without &s;leeves, blaming tho&s;e who had
<PB N="11" REF="033747_0010_0FF91616AA5DB400">
taken mine from me. It was &s;oothing to find a &s;park of humanity in my barbarous masters, who had but the day before mancipated and &s;tripped us. This was the only Mahometan I ever met with, in whom I had the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of humanity was kindled.</P>
<P>They having cho&s;en a &s;ufficient number of the Algerines to take command of the prize, they ordered us all into the launch; and when they were all embarked, they rowed along &s;ide their own ve&s;&s;el, and ordered us on board. We embarked accordingly, and were conduc|ted by &s;ome of the &s;ea rovers to the door of the poop, at which place we were received by a negro man, who conducted us into the cabin: when we entered the cabin, we &s;aw the com|mander of the pirates, &s;itting upon a matt on the cabin floor; who, with the help of an in|terpreter, a&s;ked us many que&s;tions concerning the ve&s;&s;el and cargo, the places of our nativity, and many others, as void of &s;en&s;e as he was of Philanthrophy who asked them. He then in|formed us that he was an Algerine, that his ve&s;&s;el belonged to Algiers, that her name was <HI>Babazera,</HI> and his name <HI>Rais Hudga Mahomet Salamia,</HI> and we were his pri&s;oners; and mu&s;t immediately experience the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, on our arrival at Algiers, which we &s;oon found to be true. Our embarra&s;&s;ments were &s;till greater, when we found that they were Alge|rines, (for before we &s;uppo&s;ed them to be Moors) knowing that the Algerines u&s;ed the
<PB N="12" REF="033747_0011_0FF9162181A3E048">
mo&s;t &s;everity towards chri&s;tian captives, of any &s;tate in all Barbary. He then informed us that Charles Logie, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> Briti&s;h Consul at Al|giers, had negociated with the Dey for a truce with the Portugue&s;e, for the term of twelve months, and before that time would expire, they would have a firm peace, and the Alge|rines could crui&s;e in the Atlantic when they thought proper. He then told us we mu&s;t do our duty as &s;eamen on board his ve&s;&s;el; we told him we had no clothes, his people having taken every thing away from us except what he &s;aw on our backs, which was not &s;ufficient for us to &s;tand the deck with. He an&s;wered in very abu&s;ive words, that we might think our&s;elves well u&s;ed, that they did not take them. And he would teach us to work naked, adding "now you are &s;laves and mu&s;t be treated as &s;uch, and do not think that you will be trea|ted wor&s;e than you really de&s;erve, for your bigotry and &s;uper&s;tition, in believing in a man who was crucified by the Jews, and di&s;regar|ding the true doctrine of God's la&s;t and grea|te&s;t prophet, Mahomet." He then ordered us immediately to our duty. When we came out of the cabin, we &s;aw the Polly ju&s;t making &s;ail, and &s;tanding after us, and that night we lo&s;t &s;ight of her, and &s;aw her no more until our arrival at Algiers.</P>
<P>About &s;un&s;et they brought us a di&s;h of oil, olives, vinegar and &s;ome bread, and told us to eat heartily while we were on board, for after our arrival at Algiers, we &s;hould not be allow|ed
<PB N="13" REF="033747_0012_0FF91628698AC018">
&s;uch dainties. Although we were very hungry, we could eat but very little, con&s;ider|ing the &s;ituation we were in, and not being u|&s;ed to &s;uch diet.</P>
<P>When we &s;at down to eat, we were accom|panied by three Dutchmen, whom we had not &s;cen before. On a&s;king them the particulars of their being on board, they informed us that they &s;ailed from Am&s;terdam, bound to Mala|ga, three weeks before, on board the &s;hip Hope belonging to New-York, commanded by John Burnham, and had been captured by an Alge|rine frigate, within ten leagues of Gibraltar. And the frigate having taken &s;everal ve&s;&s;els, and having a great number of Chri&s;tian cap|tives on board, the Capt. of the frigate being fearful le&s;t they &s;hould make an attempt to ri&s;e upon the ve&s;&s;el, had di&s;tributed them on board the other Cor&s;airs, which had not taken any prizes. After we had fini&s;hed our &s;upper they divided us (12 in number) into two wat|ches and ordered us to &s;tand the deck, in our re&s;pective watches. It fell to my lot to have the fir&s;t watch below, and as we went down they ordered us into the &s;ail-room to &s;leep, and &s;hewed us the door. We were obliged to creep in, upon our hands and knees, and &s;tow our&s;elves upon the &s;ails, in the be&s;t manner we could. We endeavoured to get a little &s;leep, but could not, as our minds were filled with horror, and dreadful apprehen&s;ions of the fate we might experience, and expecting addition|al &s;everity on our arrival at Algiers. We lay
<PB N="14" REF="033747_0013_0FF9162F28E38398">
in this unhappy condition, bemoaning our haple&s;s fate, until we &s;uppo&s;ed it to be pa&s;t mid|night, and could not conceive the rea&s;on that the watch was not relieved, as is cu&s;tomary a|mong Americans and Engli&s;h. And being &s;trangers to their manner of relieving the watch, &s;uppo&s;ed we had (innocently) neglected our du|ty; this made us very unea&s;y, fearing the watch had been relieved, and we not knowing it, they would inflict &s;ome corporal puni&s;hment, I then propo&s;ed to my fellow &s;ufferers, that I would go on deck, in order to know whether they had called the watch or not; but they ad|vi&s;ed me not to go, adding, that if the watch was not called, they might treat me very ill for appearing on deck in the night, when my duty did not call me there, we then determi|ned to wait 'till we were called, and to bear patiently our puni&s;hment if they inflicted any. We waited in this &s;u&s;pence for near an hour longer, when I re&s;olved to go on deck by my|&s;elf, and know the i&s;&s;ue: With this re&s;olution, I crept upon my hands and knees to the &s;ail room door, and on my appearance at the door, a Turk came to me, armed with a Scymitar &amp; a pair of Pi&s;tols, and made me to under&s;tand by &s;igns, that he wanted to know where I was going, I an&s;wered him in the &s;ame manner, made him under&s;tand that nece&s;&s;ity called me on deck. He then conducted me to the hatchway, and &s;poke to &s;ome per&s;on on the deck, in his own language, which I could not under&s;tand, and pointing with his &s;inger, I found that I had
<PB N="15" REF="033747_0014_0FF9163881EA5B40">
permi&s;&s;ion to go up. I accordingly went on deck, and was received by another Turk, ar|med in the &s;ame manner, he asked me, in the French language, if I wi&s;hed to go in the head, which I an&s;wered in the affirmative: as I un|der&s;tood &s;ome French, and could hold a tolera|ble di&s;cour&s;e with him, I a&s;ked him if the watch was called, which he an&s;wered in the negative, and on a&s;king him if it was not pa&s;t twelve o'clock, he told me it was pa&s;t two.</P>
<P>On enquiring the manner of their &s;tanding a watch, he informed me that they kept ten hours for one watch; and that it commenced at 8 o'clock in the evening and continued un|til 6 in the morning; then relieved and kept till 4 in the afternoon, and their dog-watch was from 4 in the afternoon till 8, having only three watches in 24 hours. I then went below and informed my fellow-&s;ufferers of what had paned, which gave them great &s;atisfaction to think we had not committed an innocent of|fence, as before we feared we had done. We were happy in being freed from the terrors of puni&s;hment. We then made our&s;elves as ea|&s;y and comfortable as we could, con&s;idering the deplorable &s;ituation we were in. But could not &s;leep any the remainder of the night, for by this time the vermin, &s;uch as lice, bugs and fleas, had found their way to our apartment, and in &s;uch quantities that it &s;eemed as if we were entirely covered with tho&s;e unwelcome gue&s;ts. However, we pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the night, in condoling our mi&s;erable condi|tion,
<PB N="16" REF="033747_0015_0FF8C4D2320D9170">
and rubbing tho&s;e vermin from our bo|dies, in the be&s;t manner we could. At 6, A. M. we were &s;urpri&s;ed by three heavy knocks from the deck, and with &s;uch force, that it &s;eemed as if they endeavoured to knock the deck to pieces, and not hearing any thing &s;aid, we could not imagine the meaning: We lay a few minutes, and were then called by a Turk, ordered on deck and informed, that that was their way of calling the watch. This office is generally performed by the boat&s;wain, or one of his mates, in the following manner: A large block is laid on the deck near the hatchway, and &s;truck upon with a very large beetle, which makes &s;uch a horrid noi&s;e, as nearly &s;ufficient to &s;tun the brain of a &s;trong headed per&s;on, and this was the cau&s;e of our &s;urpri&s;e before mentioned. This being Saturday the 26th of October. We pa&s;&s;ed the rock of Gibraltar on Monday the 28th and nothing of any con&s;e|quence happened on our pa&s;&s;age to Algiers; &s;poke &s;everal ve&s;&s;els, but none proved to be their enemies. We having a very fre&s;h breeze from the we&s;tward, we arrived at Algiers on Friday the fir&s;t of November.</P>
<P>After they had brought their ve&s;&s;el to an an|chor in the roads, they hoi&s;ted out their boats and ordered us to embark, and to lay our&s;elves down in the bottom of the boat: Having o|beyed their commands, we were rowed on &s;hore, and landed, amid&s;t the &s;houts and huz|zas of thou&s;ands of malicious barbarians. We were conducted to the Dey's palace by a guard,
<PB N="17" REF="033747_0016_0FF9163F77A5F4D8">
and as we pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;treets, our ears were &s;tunned with &s;houts, clapping of hands and other acclamations of joy from the inhabi|tants; thanking God for their great &s;ucce&s;s and victories over &s;o many Chri&s;tian dogs and unbelievers, the appellation they generally give to all Chri&s;tians. On our arrival at the gates of the Palace, we were received by another Guard, &amp; conducted before the Dey, who after taking a view of us, told us he had &s;ent &s;everal to our government, entreating them to negociate with him for a peace, and had never received any &s;atisfactory an&s;wer from them: That he was determined never to make a peace with the United States, in his reign, as they had &s;o often neglected his reque&s;ts, and treated him with di&s;dain, adding "now I have got you, you christian dogs, you &s;hall eat &s;tones." He then picked out four boys to wait upon him|&s;elf in the palace, as follows, Benjamin Church, Benjamin Ober, Charles Smith and John Ram|&s;ey, and then ordered the re&s;t of us to be con|ducted to the pri&s;on <HI>Bili<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> When we arrived there, we found &s;everal other Americans, who landed a little before us, and they informed us that the Cor&s;airs had captured ten &s;ail of Ame|rican ve&s;&s;els, and their captains and crews were chiefly in the &s;ame pri&s;on.</P>
<L><HI>One weeks extremity may teach us more,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Than long pro&s;perity had done before:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Death is forgotten in our ea&s;y &s;tate,</HI></L>

<P>After condoling our haple&s;s fate, for a con|fiderable time; a French prie&s;t came to us and enquired, if any among us under&s;tood the French language, and was an&s;wered in the af|firmative. After conver&s;ing &s;ometime with the per&s;on who &s;poke French, he left us, and told us he &s;hould return in a few minutes.&mdash;About half an hour afterwards he returned, and two Moors with him, who brought two ba&s;kets full of white bread, and he gave each man a loaf, weighing nearly a pound, which was a very delicious meal for us, we having eaten nothing during the day, it now being about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. He likewi&s;e inform|ed us that it was a cu&s;tom among tho&s;e &s;ons, of rapine and plunder, not to allow the &s;laves any kind of food on the fir&s;t day of their land|ing, except one &s;mall loaf of bread at night&mdash;And what we then received, he gave us, out of his own pocket, and &s;aid if he was able, his charity would further extend. We thanked our kind benefactor, and he then took his leave of us. We then walked from one part of the <HI>Bagnio</HI> to another, not knowing in what part we might be allowed to remain. We wandered in this manner, bemoaning our de|plorable &s;ituation, 'till about 5 o'clock, when we &s;aw (according to the be&s;t our judgment) about 600 men enter the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> all appearing to be in a more miserable condition than our|&s;elves,
<PB N="19" REF="033747_0018_0FF91652148A3D60">
with wretched habits, dejected counte|nances, and chains on their legs, every part of them be&s;peaking unutterable di&s;tre&s;s. I enqui|red of the pri&s;on-keeper, who tho&s;e people were, and of what crimes they had been guilty, that they were loaded with &s;uch heavy chains. I was an&s;wered, that they were chri&s;tian &s;laves, had been captured in the &s;ame manner as my|&s;elf, &s;eeking an hone&s;t livelihood: A few mi|nutes afterwards, we heard a man &s;houting out in a mo&s;t terrible manner, and not under&s;tand|ing his language, made it &s;ound more terrible. We were immediately informed by a man who under&s;tood the Engli&s;h Language, that all us (Americans) mu&s;t appear in the third gallery. We made all ha&s;te up we po&s;&s;ibly could, and as we entered the gallery we pa&s;&s;ed one at a time through a narrow door, on one &s;ide of which &s;tood a ta&s;k-ma&s;ter, and on the other &s;ide a Chri&s;tian &s;lave. The former had a large &s;tick in his hand, and the latter a book, in which was written the names of all the chri&s;ti|an captives in that pri&s;on. The chri&s;tian a&s;k|ed each man his name, and then wrote it in the book, and as we pa&s;&s;ed, the Turk gave each man a &s;mall bundle. On examining it, we found it contained a blanket, a <HI>capoot</HI> (which is a &s;ort of jacket with a head) a wai&s;tcoat, made &s;omething like a frock, to draw over the head, it not being open at the belly, a &s;hirt, with neither collar or wri&s;tbands, a pair of trow&s;ers, made &s;omewhat like a woman's pet|ticoat, (with this difference,) the bottom being
<PB N="20" REF="033747_0019_0FF9165BE55718E8">
&s;ewed up, and two holes to put the legs thro' and a pair of &s;lippers. There was neither but|ton, or button-hole on the whole &s;uit. Such a &s;uit excepting the blanket, of which they never get but one, is given to each captive once a year. The day they receive this &s;uit is on Friday en&s;uing Chri&s;tmas. Soon after we received the above mentioned bundle, we were again called into the third gallery, and pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner as before, and hav|ing our names called &s;eparately by the clerk, we pa&s;&s;ed the ta&s;k-ma&s;ter, and received each man a &s;mall loaf of very black, &s;our bread weighing about three ounces and a half, which we ate, although it was not &s;o delicious as the bread we received from the French Prie&s;t.&mdash;Having fini&s;hed our &s;upper, we lay down up|on the &s;tone floor, and went to &s;leep, and made our&s;elves as comfortable, as we could, having neither bed, nor bedding, except the blanket before mentioned; but being very much fa|tigued, we &s;lept tolerably well until about 3 o'clock, when were alarmed with a terrible &s;houting, as before, and were all ordered to go down into the lower part of the pri&s;on.&mdash;When we arrived there, they put a chain on each mans leg, reaching up to the &s;houlder, and weighing about 25, or 30lb. this was our fir&s;t nights lodging in this doleful man&s;ion of horror and de&s;pair. This done, it now being day-break&mdash;Saturday the 2d of November, we were all driven out of the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> and from thence to the Marine, where I experienced the
<PB N="21" REF="033747_0020_0FF9165FE96A5B20">
harde&s;t days work, I ever underwent before.&mdash;The dreadful clanking of the chains, was the mo&s;t terrible noi&s;e I ever heard. And never during my whole captivity did I feel &s;uch hor|rors of mind, as on this dreadful morning.</P>

As it is not in my power to write the particu|lars of each day of my captivity, (which would be too tedious to my readers,) I only intend to give you a &s;hort narrative of &s;ome of the mo&s;t particular occurrences, which happened while I was in this abject &s;lavery, and the com|mon labor, and u&s;age of the &s;laves, which is as follows.</P>
<P>At day break, in the morning, the pri&s;on-keeper calls all the &s;laves out to go to work; at the door of the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> they are met by the <HI>Guardians</HI> or ta&s;k-ma&s;ters (who have their or|ders from the <HI>Guardian Bachi;</HI> he is the ma&s;|ter of all the &s;laves that belong to the regency) they are then conducted to whatever place he has directed. The greate&s;t part of their work, is blowing rocks in the mountains. While &s;ome are drilling the holes, others are digging the earth from off tho&s;e rocks, which are un|der it, and others carrying away the dirt in ba&s;kets. When the rocks are blown, they take &s;uch as will an&s;wer their purpo&s;e: (Rocks le&s;s than 20 Tons weight, will not &s;erve.)&mdash;Many are hauled by the &s;laves, two miles di&s;|tance, which weigh 40 tons. They roll them to the bottom of the mountain, where is a con|venient place to put them on a &s;led. Here they are left until Friday, (which is the Mahome|tan Sabbath, on which day all the Chri&s;tian &s;laves belonging to the Regency, are driven out to haul them to the Quay, which is about two miles from the place where they are loaded.&mdash;In order to haul the&s;e rocks, they place them
<PB N="23" REF="033747_0022_0FF9166AD5099308">
upon a &s;led made of large &s;quare timber, and after being &s;ufficiently &s;ecured with ropes, they put about &s;ix or &s;even hundred men to each &s;led, who haul it with ropes about &s;even inches in circumference, and as the road is all paved with large flat &s;tones, they make &s;ome progre&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s. When ri&s;ing an a&s;cent, &s;hould the number who are at one &s;led, not be able to haul it up, they are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the re&s;t. By this means, they are enabled to haul three, or four rocks in a day, upon each &s;led. From this Quay, they are taken on board a <HI>Puntoon</HI> (which is a large flat bottomed kind of ve&s;&s;el) and di&s;charged at the back of the mole, with the help of wheels. The&s;e rocks are laid there in order to break off the &s;ea, that the mole may not wa&s;h away; which mu&s;t have a continual &s;upply, for every gale of wind that comes wa&s;hes them into deep water. After a gale they have as much need of them as they had the fir&s;t hour after the mole was built. So we may conclude this is a work that will never be fini&s;hed. On Friday when the &s;laves, are going to work in the mountains, they pa&s;s out thro' the gates of the city, about day break in the morning, and arrive at the bottom of the mountain, &s;ometime before &s;unri&s;e.&mdash;On their arrival there, they are divided by the ta&s;k-ma&s;|ters, into different gangs, each gang has one &s;led. They mu&s;t haul as many in a day as the ta&s;k-ma&s;ters think proper, and are treated with additional rigor and &s;everity on this day. For the drivers being anxious to have as many haul|ed
<PB N="24" REF="033747_0023_0FF916721A1B9030">
as po&s;&s;ible, (becau&s;e the number they haul mu&s;t be reported to the Dey,)&mdash;they are con|tinully beating the &s;laves with their &s;ticks, &amp; goading them with its end, in which is a &s;mall &s;pear, not unlike an ox-goad, among our farm|ers.</P>
<P>If any one chance to faint, and fall down with fatigue, they generally beat them until they are able to ri&s;e again.</P>
<P>At night when they are done hauling, all hands are called together, and have their names called by the clerk, and every one mu&s;t pa&s;s the <HI>Guardian Bachi,</HI> as his name is called.&mdash;Af|ter they are done calling, and find that none are mi&s;&s;ing, they are driven by the ta&s;k-ma&s;ters into the city, then left to go to the <HI>Bagnio</HI> by them&s;elves, and mu&s;t appear there within half an hour after they enter the gates of the city.</P>
<P>The roll is called every night in the pri&s;on, a few minutes before the gates are locked.&mdash;If any one neglects his call, he is immediately put into irons, hands and feet, then chained to a pillar, where he mu&s;t remain until the next morning. Then the irons are taken from his feet, and he is driven before a task-ma&s;ter, to the marine, and the <HI>Viguilhadge,</HI> (who is the mini&s;ter of the marine) orders what puni&s;h|ment he thinksproper, which is immediately inflicted by the ta&s;k-ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>He commonly orders 150, or 200 Ba&s;tina|does.</P>
<P>The manner of inflicting this puni&s;hment is as follows: The per&s;on is laid upon his face,
<PB N="25" REF="033747_0024_0FF915D6B0EE7570">
with his hands in irons behind him, and his legs la&s;hed together with a rope.&mdash;One ta&s;k|ma&s;ter holds down his head and another his legs, while two others inflict the puni&s;hment upon his breech, with &s;ticks &s;ome what larger than an ox-goad. After he has received one half his puni&s;hment in this manner, they la&s;h his ancles to a pole, and two Turks lift the pole up, and hold it in &s;uch a manner, as brings the &s;oles of his feet upward, and the re|mainder of his puni&s;hment, he receives upon the &s;oles of his feet. Then he is relea&s;ed from his bands, and obliged to go directly to work a|mong the re&s;t of his fellow-&s;laves. On other days of the week only a part of the &s;laves work in the mountains, &amp; the others in the marine, tho&s;e in the marine, are again divided into diffe|rent companies, each company have different kinds of employ. Some are employed in careen|ing the cor&s;airs, and &s;itting them for &s;ea. At other times they are &s;tripping them and haul|ing them up. Others are di&s;charging their prizes, cleaning the harbor, and bringing tho&s;e large rocks, before mentioned to the mole and every article that is tran&s;ported from one part of the marine to another, or from the marine to the city, or from the city to the marine, or el&s;ewhere, mu&s;t be carried by the &s;laves, with poles, upon their &s;houlders. For the &s;treets are &s;o narrow, that no kind of a carriage is u&s;ed here, not even a wheelbarrow. In many &s;treets it is difficult for one man to pa&s;s another.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="033747_0025_0FF9167C2162FB58">
When their prizes are di&s;charged, their car|go mu&s;t be all carried into the city, and &s;tow|ed in magazines, &s;o that &s;ome part of the &s;laves are con&s;tantly carrying hogsheads of &s;ugar, pipes of wine, ca&s;ks of nails, cannon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They work from day break in the morning, until a certain hour in the afternoon, which they call <HI>Laza,</HI> which is ju&s;t half an hour be|fore &s;un&s;et, &s;ummer and winter. At which time they hoi&s;t a white flag upon the <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> to denote that it is the hour of prayer, it being contrary to their religion to have a bell &s;ound among them.</P>
<P>On Fridays they hoi&s;t a green flag, this be|ing a favorite color of Mahomet. All the &s;laves at this hour are ordered to leave work, except when they are fitting the cor&s;airs for &s;ea in a hurry. Oftentimes when this is the ca&s;e they are obliged to work all night, and go up to the gate, called <HI>Babazia,</HI> which is the marine gate, and before they can pa&s;s, they are &s;earched by the ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, to prevent their &s;tealing any thing from the Regency; if they are found with any thing, except a few chips, they do not e&s;cape puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I have known a &s;lave receive an hundred ba&s;tinadoes for being found with three board nails.</P>
<P>Having related the daily labors of the &s;laves, I now proceed to give you an account of the provi&s;ions they are allowed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on, to enable them to perform this laborious &s;lavery, and the cloathing they have allowed to keep
<PB N="27" REF="033747_0026_0FF9168334D0B8B0">
them from the cold rains and the &s;corching rays of the &s;un.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock in the morning they are called by one of the ta&s;k-ma&s;ters from their work to take breakfa&s;t. Which they receive in the following order. When they are called they all leave their work, and go near &s;ome &s;acks of bread. As they pa&s;s by, they are counted by one of the drivers, while another gives each man a loaf of bread: And to every eighth man he gives a wooden bowl with a|bout a pint of vinegar, in this manner they pa&s;s until all have received their allowance.&mdash;They then &s;it down upon the ground to eat, and are commonly called to work in about ten minutes, and are &s;eldom allowed more than 12. The &s;ame ceremony is pa&s;&s;ed at 12 o'clock, when they receive the &s;ame allowance. At night when the roll is called they receive ano|ther loaf of bread, but no vinegar.</P>
<P>This is all the provi&s;ion they have allowed them from the Regency. But oftentimes when they are at work on board the cor&s;airs, the &s;teward will give them a little &s;weet oil, and &s;ometimes &s;ome olives, this they count a fea&s;t. The&s;e loaves of bread weigh about three ounces and an half. I have weighed &s;everal and never found one to exceed three ounces and eleven drachms. So what bread each man has allowed him for a day, will not exceed eleven ounces, and it is &s;o &s;our, that a per&s;on mu&s;t be almo&s;t &s;tarving before he can eat it.&mdash;
<PB N="28" REF="033747_0027_0FF9168D787E47C0">
The rea&s;on of its being &s;o &s;our is their mixing the dough three days before it is baked.</P>
<P>To make this bread they &s;ift the bran of wheat, after the flour and middlings are taken out.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may think what I have already related could not be augmented, with additi|onal &s;everity, but alas, this is not all. The <HI>Bagnio</HI> in which the &s;laves &s;leep, is built with &s;everal galleries, one above another; in each gallery are &s;everal &s;mall rooms, in them the &s;laves &s;leep. For the u&s;e of the&s;e rooms they mu&s;t pay a certain &s;um of money every moon to the <HI>Guardian Bachi,</HI> or &s;leep in the open <HI>Bagnio,</HI> where they have nothing but the firmament to cover them. On the evening after the moon changes, the keeper of the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> calls out for all hands to pay for their rooms. If any one who has &s;lept in a room during the moon, has not procured the money, and can|not pay it down, his hands are put into irons behind him, and his legs chained to a pillar e|very night, until the money is paid. They are relea&s;ed in the morning to go to their work and are chained again at night. Tho&s;e mi&s;era|ble objects are commonly relieved by the re&s;t of their fellow-&s;ufferers.</P>
<P>Some of the &s;laves are allowed a &s;mall pit|tance from their country, which enables them to pay this demand. Others are mechanics and work at their trades in the night, to pro|cure this &s;um; others get it by theft, though they often hazard their lives by &s;o doing;
<PB N="29" REF="033747_0028_0FF9168F14314BD8">
and many are obliged to &s;leep every night up|on the cold &s;tones, with nothing but the hea|vens to cover them, for want of money to pay this tribute.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> where the &s;laves &s;leep, is a kind of mu&s;eum, belonging to the Dey; which contains a great number of Animals of prey. They are confined with chains in differ|ent apartments from where the &s;laves &s;leep.&mdash;And are maintained by them; with Bullock's and Sheeps heads; this money mu&s;t be paid every moon when they pay for the rooms they &s;leep in.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another demand as unrea&s;ona|ble as any of the former. After their <HI>Rama|dan,</HI> which is a fa&s;t that continues a whole moon during which time they cannot eat, drink, &s;moak, or even wet their lips while the &s;un is above the horizon, (what they do eat, is in the night) they have a great fea&s;t, which continues two days, on the evening previous to the fea&s;t, each &s;lave mu&s;t carry 2 fowls to the ta&s;k-ma&s;ter; as a pre&s;ent; and a certain number of &s;heep, is given them, for which each &s;lave mu&s;t pay his proportionable part. During tho&s;e two days, the &s;laves are locked in the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> and are allowed no kind of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the Regency except one &s;mall loaf of bread which I mentioned before, and this they receive each night when the roll is called. The drivers, on the fir&s;t morning of the fea&s;t, give each &s;lave a loaf of good white bread, weighing about half
<PB N="30" REF="033747_0029_0FF91690A9EE44A8">
a pound, for which they had received two fowls from each &s;lave the evening before.</P>
<P>In this deplorable &s;ituation, were upwards of 1,200 Chri&s;tian captives, dragging out a mi&s;e|rable exi&s;tence, with the woeful appellation of &s;lave preying upon their mind when I left Al|giers.</P>
<P>The cloathing which is allowed them for a year, is &s;uch a &s;uit as was contained in the bun|dle which I explained in a former part of this book, they receive it the fir&s;t Friday after Chri&s;tmas, as before ob&s;erved. The fir&s;t Friday in January, when it begins on Friday excepted, then the &s;econd, all the captives belonging to the Regency, are obliged to go about &s;even miles into the country, and gather reeds, and carry them to the Dey's garden, for Beans, Peas, &amp;c. to run upon, and this is a very tedi|ous day's work.</P>
<P>At this &s;ea&s;on of the year the rains fall in a|bundance in that country, which renders the walking very di&s;agreeable as we do not follow the road, but are obliged to cro&s;s fields, and meadows. The di&s;tance tho&s;e reeds are car|ried is about eight miles.</P>
<P>We go out at the ea&s;ternmo&s;t gate of the ci|ty called <HI>Babazoone,</HI> and it is near 7 miles from this gate to the place where they are gathered, and from thence they mu&s;t be carried to the Dey's garden, which is near a mile we&s;tward of the gate called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> which is the we&s;t gate of the city.

<HEAD>CHAPTER II. The puni&s;hments which are common for Chri&s;tian Captives, for different offences: For Mahometans and Jews, having committed &s;imilar crimes, to|gether with &s;ome entertaining &s;tories of the puni&s;h|ments inflicted on the Chri&s;tian &s;laves, Mahome|tans, Jews and Renegadoes, which occurred (to my knowledge) during my Captivity, and &s;ome accidents which happened.</HEAD>
<P>THE puni&s;hments mo&s;t common for &s;mall offences, are ba&s;tinadoes, of which I &s;hall &s;ay but very little, having already related the manner of inflicting them; I &s;hall how|ever relate in the cour&s;e of this chapter, a few in&s;tances of people being ba&s;tinadoed for very &s;mall offences or rather no offence at all.</P>
<P>In the month of October '93, which was be|fore I had the mi&s;fortune of being an eye wit|ne&s;s, but of which I had a verbal account, 14 &s;laves of different nations, made an attempt to run away with a boat, but were finally overta|ken after they were &s;everal leagues at &s;ea, and brought <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to Algiers.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="033747_0031_0FF916A1592D82C8">
When they were landed, and carried before the Dey, he ordered the &s;teer&s;man, and bowman to be beheaded, and the re&s;t to receive five hundred ba&s;tinadoes each, to have a chain of 50 weight fa&s;tened to each man's leg for life, and a wooden block of about 70lb. to the end of that, which they were obliged to carry up|on their &s;houlder when they walked to do their work. When they are at work they lay the block down, and can only work within the length of their chain. When they have occa|&s;ion to go further, they mu&s;t carry the block, to the place where the work calls them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of them who were living when I left Algiers, which was the 13th July, '96, were &s;till in this mi&s;erable &s;ituation.</P>
<P>They have different puni&s;hments for capital offences, &s;ometimes they are burned, or rather roa&s;ted alive. At other times they are impal|ed. This is done by placing the criminal upon a &s;harp iron &s;take, &amp; thru&s;ting it up the po&s;teri|ors, by his back bone until it appears at the back of his neck.</P>
<P>For being found in company with a Maho|metan woman he is beheaded, and the woman is put into a &s;ack and carried about a mile at &s;ea, and thrown overboard, with a &s;ufficient quantity of rocks, or a bomb, to &s;ink her. For &s;u&s;picion of being with one, the &s;lave is ca&s;tra|ted, and the woman ba&s;tinadoed.</P>
<P>A &s;lave for murder of another &s;lave is im|mediately beheaded. But for murder of a Mahometan he is ca&s;t off from the walls of the

<P>On the 16th of April, 1794, as all hands were at work in the mountains, Jo&s;eph Keith, and Peter Barry, being very much fatigued, they went to a &s;pring of water about fifty yards di&s;tant, from where the re&s;t of the &s;laves were at work, and after having drank &s;ome water they felt faint, and &s;at down upon the gra&s;s.

<P>Another circum&s;tance of this kind happened in March, 1796, one of the&s;e Oran &s;laves hav|ing been informed, that the money for the re|demption of the Spaniards, who de&s;erted from that place, was lodged in the hands of a Spani&s;h prie&s;t, re&s;ident at Algiers, and that he had neg|lected their liberation; the &s;lave went to the prie&s;t, and a&s;ked if he had money for the re|demption of the Spaniards. Being an&s;wered in the negative, he drew a knife, and &s;tabbed the prie&s;t in fourteen different places, and left him to all appearance dead. However, the prie&s;t recovered.

<P>As he was going with her he met a &s;lave, who had been &s;ent by one of the ta&s;k-ma&s;ters to bring a jug of water from an adjacent &s;pring. The &s;lave a&s;ked what crime the woman was guilty of, that he was dragging her along in &s;uch a manner, with her hands tied behind her. He was an&s;wered &s;he had been &s;itting a|mong &s;ome bu&s;hes waiting for the embraces of &s;ome Chri&s;tian.

The villain not being as ea&s;ily bribed as the &s;lave &s;uppo&s;ed, an&s;wered, "you are the Chri&s;tian dog who&s;e embraces &s;he has been &s;eeking," and calling a Turk to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who was at a &s;mall di&s;tance from them, they dragged the two poor innocent victims before the <HI>Cadi,</HI> and they not being allowed to &s;peak in their own defence, the cau&s;e was laid before the judge in words to this purpo&s;e, "we found the&s;e two per&s;ons out &s;ide the gate <HI>Babazoone,</HI> a|mong &s;ome bu&s;hes in actual embraces." The <HI>Cadi</HI> then ordered the man to be carried be|fore the Dey's palace, and there be beheaded, and the woman to be &s;ewed up in a &s;ack, with
<PB N="37" REF="033747_0036_0FF916ADB4565890">
a bomb &s;hell at her feet, to be carried one mile at &s;ea, and thrown overboard. A few minutes after this &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed, and they were ordered to their re&s;pective places of execution, the <HI>Cadi</HI> was credibly informed that they had not been found together as it had been report|ed to him. He then ordered them both to be ba&s;tinadoed for &s;u&s;picion. This me&s;&s;age arriv|ed at the Dey's Palace ju&s;t when the <HI>Novagi,</HI> (who is one of the Dey's corps of guard) was drawing his Scymitre to deprive an innocent Chri&s;tian of life. The poor &s;lave however, re|ceived five hundred ba&s;tinadoes, which di&s;a|bled him in &s;uch a manner, that he was unable to &s;peak for near forty eight hours, and was not capable of walking for upwards of two months afterwards.</P>
<P>While they were preparing to inflict his puni&s;hment, he was ince&s;&s;antly be&s;eeching them, to execute the former &s;entence and ex|claiming, "Oh! that the <HI>Cadi</HI> had not been undeceived, that I might have died at one blow, and e&s;caped the&s;e tortures." But alas, the me&s;&s;enger arrived too late for the poor woman, for &s;he was ca&s;t into her watery grave a few minutes before the me&s;&s;age arrived.</P>
<P>About four days afterwards, &s;he was found upon the &s;ea-&s;hore, di&s;engaged from the &s;ack and bomb-&s;hell, looking nearly as fre&s;h as when &s;he was alive.</P>
<P>She was then taken and interred, near the place where &s;he wa&s;hed on &s;hore, and has a large marble monument built over her remains.</P>

They now pray at her monument as a &s;aint; and &s;ay if &s;he had not been innocent &s;he could not have di&s;engaged her&s;elf from the &s;ack and bomb-&s;hell.

<P>A Turk for offences capital, is &s;trangled in the following manner. The criminal is confi|ned, with his back again&s;t a wall, in which are two holes, directly oppo&s;ite the back of his

neck, through the&s;e holes is reaved a rope, with the two ends on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, from where the criminal is, and the bite or double of the rope coming about the criminals neck. Then the two ends are knotted together, and the ex|ecutioner puts a &s;tick in between the rope and wall. Then turning the &s;tick round (as the &s;ea phra&s;e is) like a Spani&s;h windla&s;s, which twi&s;ting the two parts of the rope together brings it tight about the criminal's neck, and he is &s;oon di&s;patched.</P>
<P>The executioner does not &s;ee the criminal while performing his office. This is accounted the mo&s;t honorable death, for per&s;ons who are executed. And beheading the mo&s;t ignomi|nious.</P>
<P>A Turk for offences not capital, is common|ly ba&s;tinadoed. A Moor or Arab, for enor|mous crimes, are &s;ometimes ca&s;t upon the hooks; and at other times, hanged or behead|ed. For &s;mall crimes they are en&s;laved, (con|demned to &s;hare the fate of chri&s;tian captives) for a certain term of time.</P>
<P>For theft, they &s;ometimes have the right hand cut off, and hung about the neck&mdash;Then the criminal is &s;et upon an a&s;s, and led through the city; with his face toward the a&s;&s;es tail, and hath &s;ometimes to wear his hand, hung by a &s;tring about his neck, as he pa&s;&s;es through the city, for &s;everal years.</P>

Such is the gro&s;s indignation the Mahome|tans, bear toward the Jewi&s;h religion, that a Turk may with impunity, (if he flees to a <HI>Marabout Mo&s;que,</HI> or pay a &s;mall penalty,) murder ten of them. If he kills the eleventh, he is then &s;trangled, no <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> or penalty will excu&s;e him: Nothing will &s;ave his life, except he is pardoned by the Dey, who&s;e word is ab|&s;olute.

In the month of May '94, as all hands were at work, dragging tho&s;e large rocks before re|lated to the quay, one of the &s;laves a <HI>Neapolitan</HI> happened to fall down, being near the &s;led, before it could be &s;topped, he was entirely cru&s;hed to pieces.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k-ma&s;ters apparently rejoiced at the accident, and with &s;miling countenances, or|dered two &s;laves to gather the remains of his body in a ba&s;ket, and bury them at the Chri&s;t|ian burial ground, ordering the re&s;t to go on with the rock, not giving them time to enquire what accident had happened. But telling them a chri&s;tian dog was gone to his own country. And many of them did not know what had happened for &s;ometime afterwards.</P>
<P>Another &s;ingular accident happened, about four months afterwards. As we were hauling rocks in the &s;ame manner, a Cor&s;ican &s;lave ac|cidentally fell down, and the &s;led went over his legs and knees, taking them both off, ju&s;t above the joint of the knees, his legs and feet being cru&s;hed in &s;uch a manner, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h one part from anoth|er.

<P>When any &s;uch accident happens among the &s;laves, it is immediately reported to the Dey. On hearing this, his obdurate heart was a little &s;oftened, and he gave permi&s;&s;ion that the father might attend his &s;on, in the ho&s;pi|tal, while he lived.</P>
<P>This melancholy event, deprived a father of his &s;on, &s;ix unhappy men of a brother, three children of a father, and a woman of her hu&s;|band. In addition to the horrors of &s;lavery, the&s;e mi&s;erable relatives were left to bemoan the untimely death of the unfortunate &s;uffe|rer.</P>

<P>ALGIERS is a Country which derives its name from its Metropolis, and ex|tends four hundred and eighty miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, along the northern coa&s;t of Africa, (this part of Africa is called Barbary.) Its greate&s;t breadth from North to South, is three hundred and twenty miles.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of about one hundred miles from the &s;ea coa&s;t, it becomes a barren de&s;ert,
<PB N="45" REF="033747_0044_0FF8C4E2B4566060">
almo&s;t entirely uninhabited by either man or bea&s;t.</P>
<P>Algiers is &s;ituated between 32 and 37 degrees of north latitude, corre&s;ponding to that of the United States, from Virginia to Carolina, inclu|&s;ive. It is bounded on the north, by the Me|diterranean &s;ea; on the South, by Mount At|las; on the ea&s;t, by the country of Tunis; and on the We&s;t, by Morocco: It is &s;eparated from that empire by the river Mulvia.</P>
<P>The principal rivers, which water the terri|tory of Algiers, ri&s;e in Mount-Atlas, running by a northerly direction into the Mediterranean &s;ea; they are &s;even in number. None of them has a long cour&s;e, or even is navigable; or at lea&s;t none of them are made use of in naviga|tion. It is however &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;ome of them might be made u&s;e of, for this purpo&s;e, were the inhabitants of a more intelligent and indu&s;trious character: for &s;ome of them are of a tolerable depth, and would admit large flat-bottomed boats to pa&s;s with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, for the purpo&s;e of conveying their produce to the &s;ea &s;hore.</P>
<P>Such is the gro&s;s ignorance of the natives of this country, in whatever concerns dome&s;tic improvements, that there is not a &s;ingle bridge over any of their rivers. Although nature has formed them in &s;uch a commodious &s;itua|tion, that bridges might ea&s;ily be con&s;tructed in many different places. Ferry-boats are en|tirely unknown among them. When they
<PB N="46" REF="033747_0045_0FF8C4EACB394A80">
are to be cro&s;&s;ed, the traveller hath oftentimes to wander &s;everal miles in &s;earch of a ford.</P>
<P>If a heavy rain happens to fall, he is &s;ome|times forced to wait &s;everal days, before the river has returned to its natural depth.</P>
<P>This country con&s;i&s;ts of eighteen provinces, which are commanded by <HI>Beys,</HI> who are &s;ubor|dinate to the <HI>Dey.</HI> The Beys of the provinces of <HI>Ma&s;cara, Titeli,</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tanina,</HI> are obliged to &s;end and carry their tribute to Algiers once every &s;ix months: They are obliged to appear before the Dey with the tribute annually them&s;elves. Six months after their departure from the Dey, they &s;end the tribute by a <HI>Galief,</HI> he is a Secretary to the Bey or Governor.</P>
<P>The Bey's of other provinces bring their tribute once every two years. They being at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the city, is the occa&s;ion of its not being demanded oftener.</P>
<P>The climate in this country is remarkably delightful. The air is pure and &s;erene. The &s;oil is covered with almo&s;t a perpetual verdure. Extreme heat is not common. In winter it is &s;eldom cold enough to freeze. I have been informed, that it has been known to freeze here, at the depth of two or three inches.</P>
<P>I once &s;aw a little fro&s;t, during my re&s;idence there, but not any ice or &s;now.</P>
<P>This de&s;cription applies to the lands on the &s;ea-coa&s;t; for as you advance into the country the land becomes more barren. Indeed a con|&s;iderable part of the back country is a &s;avage de&s;ert, abounding with Lions, Tigers, Leo|pard's,
<PB N="47" REF="033747_0046_0FF916C775976FC8">
Jackall's, Buffaloe's wild Boar's Porcu|pine's, &amp;c. And it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the&s;e animals are not the lea&s;t amiable in|habitants of this country.</P>
<P>There are few towns at pre&s;ent in the&s;e &s;tates of any con&s;equence, though when &s;ucce&s;&s;ively under the dominion of Carthage, and Rome, they abounded with many populous cities, and to have a re&s;idence here was con&s;idered as the highe&s;t &s;tate of luxury.</P>
<P>The produce of their &s;oil formed the ma|gazines which formerly &s;upplied all Italy and a great part of the Roman Empire, with corn, wine and oil. Though the lands are ill culti|vated through the oppre&s;&s;ion and barbarity of the government, yet they are &s;till fertile: dates, figs, rai&s;ins, almonds, apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, citrons, lemons, oranges, pomegranets, with plenty of herbs and roots.</P>

<P>The city of Algiers lies in lat, 36, 50, North and in long. 2 47, Ea&s;t, over again&s;t the I&s;land of Minorca, three hundred and eighty miles we&s;tward of Tunis. It &s;tands on a bay of the Mediterranean &s;ea. It is built upon the &s;ide of a very high hill, with &s;o great an a&s;cent, that the hou&s;es ri&s;ing gradually one above another from the &s;ea &s;hore, it forms an amphitheatre, The city appears beautiful at a di&s;tance when approaching from the &s;ea. A per&s;on on fir&s;t &s;ight of it at a di&s;tance would &s;uppo&s;e it to be a &s;now bank. This is occa&s;ioned by the hou|&s;es being white-wa&s;hed on the out &s;ide. The city is of a quadrangular form, and is near three miles in circumference, encompa&s;&s;ed with two walls about twenty five feet di&s;tant from each other, and in &s;ome places an hundred feet
<PB N="50" REF="033747_0049_0FF916D335EFC128">
in heighth. The outward wall is defended by upwards of three hundred bra&s;s cannon, and out &s;ide that is a deep entrenchment forty feet wide, over which are built bridges at the gates of the city. In the intermediate &s;pace between the walls, are magazines for public &s;tores. The mole of the harbour is about five hundred paces in length, extending from the continent to a ledge of rocks, where there are three ca&s;tles, with large batteries of bra&s;s guns. The&s;e ca&s;tles are known by the names of Fen|ella, Cordalaras, and Sardenia. On the form|er is a very excellent light hou&s;e, from which the ca&s;tle derives its name Fenelle, &s;ignifying (in Arabec,) a light.</P>
<P>This mole was begun and fini&s;hed in the reign of Hayradin. He commenced its foun|dation in the year 1536, at this time, it is re|ported, he had thirty thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;laves in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

Several of the latter were de&s;troyed in the expedition of Charles 5th in the year 1541. All the remaining ones have received great im|provements, &s;ince, and &s;ome new batteries e|rected as occa&s;ion required.

The city is computed to contain one hun|dred and twenty thou&s;and inhabitants. The fortifications are exten&s;ive and &s;trong. There are &s;aid to be fifteen thou&s;and hou&s;es, which are all built entirely with &s;tone and lime, and are all flat roofed, they are commonly built round an oblong &s;quare, with a paved court in the centre. Around this court is a triple range of Galleries, one above another which are &s;upported by pillars. The principal build|ings are the Dey's palace, a ho&s;pital for Chri&s;|tian &s;laves, and &s;everal large mo&s;ques. The former &s;tands near the centre of the city, is very large but not magnificent.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pital for Chri&s;tian &s;laves, &s;tands in the principal &s;treet of the town. Is &s;omewhat commodious, and tolerably well attended.&mdash;This ho&s;pital was erected as a deed of charity by the king of Spain, for the benefit of Chri&s;|tian &s;laves, in the year&mdash;, and is &s;till main|tained by the Spani&s;h government.</P>
<P>When a &s;lave is found &s;o &s;ick that he is in|capable of doing any kind of work, they then permit him to go into this ho&s;pital, where he is &s;uffered to remain until they &s;uppo&s;e he is able to work again; while he remains here he is very well u&s;ed by the Doctors and Prie&s;ts.&mdash;They generally allow three or four of the for|mer, and eight or ten of the latter to attend it.</P>
<P>The Doctors pre&s;cribe the medicine, which is to be given to the patient, and the prie&s;t's prepare, and admini&s;ters it.</P>

While a &s;lave is &s;ick in this place, he is no manner of expence to the Regency, he being maintained with victuals, drink, medicine, and attendance by the Spaniards. It is the duty of a particular ta&s;kma&s;ter, to vi&s;it the ho&s;pital e|very morning, in order to take a view of the &s;laves, and to pa&s;s his opinion upon them, or any particular one of them, concerning their, or his, ablene&s;s to perform the duty a&s;&s;igned the &s;laves in general, and if he finds any one whom he thinks (by his countenance, or any other circum&s;tance,) able to perform any kind of work, the forlorn &s;on of wretchedne&s;s, is driven out from the ho&s;pital, to perform his ta&s;k, among the re&s;t of his fellow &s;ufferers, and the Doctors are not even a&s;ked whether they think he is able or not. And often times they are driven out in this-manner, to work, and are obliged to return to the ho&s;pital again, within a &s;hort time after their departure and often expire in a few hours after their return. Cruelties of this nature are very common in this horrible place, and the untimely death of a Chri&s;tian, is nothing more thought of, by the inhabitants, than the death of one of their do|me&s;tic animals.</P>

He told the ta&s;kma&s;ter, he was not a|ble to walk to the marine, and much le&s;s capa|ble of performing his de&s;tined labour if he was there; at which the mercile&s;s villain, gave him &s;everal &s;evere &s;trokes with his &s;tick &s;aying "if you are not able, I will make you able," and with that drove him to the marine. The Doctors u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to di&s;|&s;uade him from it; and begged that he might be allowed to remain a few days longer; all their per&s;ua&s;ions, and rea&s;oning were to no purpo&s;e, the wretch would not hearken to any thing they &s;aid, but drove the poor man before him, to work. He accordingly with great difficulty arrived at the marine, where he did his work in the be&s;t manner his feeble condi|tion would allow, for about half an hour, and being exhau&s;ted he fell down upon the ground in&s;en&s;ible.

This alone is &s;ufficient to a&s;certain the depth of the wretchedne&s;s of Chri&s;tians, whom fortune has unhappily thrown into the hands of tho&s;e dete&s;table piratical barbarians. In former days, the Chri&s;tian captives when dead, were not allowed to be interred, but were car|ried out about half a Mile to the ea&s;tward of the city, and precipitated down the banks into the &s;ea. This manner of di&s;po&s;ing of the dead bodies of Chri&s;tians, was practi&s;ed by the Al|gerines untill about the beginning of the &s;even|teenth century. At this time, a Roman Ca|tholic prie&s;t, who was making a tour through Barbary, happened to be in Algiers, and the Plague raging very &s;evere in the city, of cour&s;e a great number of &s;laves died, and were ca&s;t into the &s;ea, this dreadful &s;pectacle, moved the heart of the humane Prie&s;t who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an independant fortune, purcha&s;ed at an exorbi|tant price,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is reported that is co&s;t him 90,000 dollars.</NOTE> about one acre of land for a burial place for chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The day he paid the money for this piece of ground, the plague broke out in his groin, which put a period to his exi&s;tence in &s;even|teen hours, con&s;equently he was the fir&s;t who was interred on this piece of land, and perhaps the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian that had been buried in the territory of Algiers &s;ince it was inhabited by Mahometans, as they formerly ca&s;t all of this denomination into the &s;ea, who paid the la&s;t debt of nature near the &s;ea-&s;hore. Tho&s;e who died in the country, were &s;uffered to remain above ground.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="033747_0054_0FF8C4E65CD178D0">
The author flatters him&s;elf that a de&s;cription of this piece of land will not be unaccepta|ble to his readers, he therefore pre&s;ents a &s;hort and authentic account of it to their peru&s;al.&mdash;It lies about half a mile we&s;tward of the city, where is a piece of low land or meadow, this is dyked in with a mound to prevent the &s;ea from wa&s;hing in, and de&s;troying the produce of the land. The burial ground is between this mound and the &s;ea, con&s;equently, in a hea|vy gale of wind, the violence of the waves wa&s;hes the dead bodies out of their graves, in|to the ocean, as the place is nothing more than a &s;andy beach, and the corps are &s;eldom buried more than one foot under the &s;and.</P>
<P>According to the records of the nation, up|wards of 98,000 Chri&s;tians have already been buried here, and &s;carcely any marks of a burial ground is to be di&s;covered, more than the great quantities of human bones which are to be &s;een laying upon the beach. They keep four &s;laves whom age has rendered incapable of any other employment, to bury their decea&s;|ed companions, as it is contrary to the religion of Mahomet, for one of that denomination, to touch the dead body of a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the burial of their own dead, the Mahometans di&s;cover a degree of delicacy of which Chri&s;tians have no conception. No|thing is more common, in our Church yards, and &s;urely nothing is more completely &s;hock|ing, than to &s;ee graves broken up, a &s;econd time before the per&s;on has returned to its original
<PB N="56" REF="033747_0055_0FF916E04B2BB208">
du&s;t; and the remains of the dead are to&s;&s;ed about with very little ceremony. This wretch|ed violation of decency ari&s;es from the orthor|dox de&s;ire of being buried in holy ground; a practice which has no doubt been encouraged by the parties concerned, for the purpo&s;e of ex|acting high prices for the land.</P>
<P>Nothing would appear more ridiculous, a|mong the profe&s;&s;ors of the Mahometan Religi|on, than to &s;ee their graves opened, at any di&s;|tance of time, or upon any pretence whatever. They would regard this as an act of the mo&s;t barbarous &s;acrilege. Hence the burial ground of Algiers, or any large city of this profe&s;&s;ion, are very exten&s;ive, it is reported that &s;ome of the burial places, in the neighborhood of large cities, are nine, or ten miles in extent.</P>
<P>By this we may &s;ee that &s;ome u&s;eful le&s;&s;on is to be learned, from almo&s;t every nation in the world.</P>
<P>The Mo&s;ques are fine buildings, tho' they make no great appearance at a di&s;tance. They are 65 in number, ten of which are very large, which are called, Marabout Ma&s;ques, by rea&s;on of ha|ving a Marabout or hermit buried in them.&mdash;The&s;e they account holy places, and an a&s;ylum for all kinds of vices.</P>
<P>A Turk having committed any crime what|ever, is pardoned if he can get into one of them before he is taken into cu&s;tody. Their religion teaches them to pardon a Mahometan, if he flees to tho&s;e Marabout or Saints, who
<PB N="57" REF="033747_0056_0FF916E2D09E8058">
are buried in tho&s;e mo&s;ques, for protection, let his offence be ever &s;o capital.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian &s;laves are al&s;o pardoned, having committed &s;mall offences, if they can get into one of them before he is taken, he will have an additional chain upon his leg and a block at its end.</P>
<P>A Jew having been apprehended in&s;ide the door of one of them, would be immediately burned or crucified. So the poor I&s;raelites have no protection for their crimes, and mu&s;t &s;ub|mit to the ab&s;olute word of a de&s;potic prince.</P>
<P>When a Mahometan, who has committed a crime, has taken the Marabout, it is imme|diately reported to the Muftie, and he reports it to the Dey, who &s;ends a &s;tring of beads by the Muftie to the keeper of the Mo&s;que, and the criminal then comes out. Though he might come out before if he plea&s;es, but &s;hould he leave the Mo&s;que, before the Muftie comes with the beads, he would be liable to the &s;ame puni&s;hment he was before he had taken the Marabout. The pre&s;ence of the Muftie and the beads denote his pardon. The Muftie then returns with the beads, to the Dey, and they are laid up until &s;ome other &s;imilar occa&s;ion. At the gates of the Dey's palace, there is a chain which is fa&s;tened at the top of the gates and at night the lower end is fa&s;tened down with a pad lock. Any &s;lave who has commit|ted an offence, and can get hold of this chain before he is taken, it &s;erves the &s;ame purpo&s;e as the Marabout Mo&s;que. If a &s;lave has been
<PB N="58" REF="033747_0057_0FF916E78E812A50">
cheated by any Turk, Cologie, Moor, Arab, Renegado, or Jew, and he takes hold of this chain, and &s;ays he wants ju&s;tice, one of the principal officers of the Dey's corps of guards goes to him and a&s;ks the particulars of his be|ing wronged, and who the per&s;on is that has wronged him, and ju&s;tice is immediately done him. But &s;hould he give a wrong account, and it be proved that he has not told the truth, he is immediately ba&s;tinadoed. If it is a Jew who is complained of, and he is found guilty, he mu&s;t make the &s;lave reparation and is ba&s;|tinadoed.</P>
<P>This city contains a great number of hot bathes, which are large, and hand&s;omely paved with marble; people of every denomination whatever are allowed to go into them and bathe, on paying double the &s;um which is paid by a Turk. If a &s;tranger happens to go in, they generally extort eight or ten fold.</P>
<P>The men &s;pend a great part of their time in bathing, &s;moking, and drinking coffee.</P>
<P>Their religion obliges them to bathe four times a day, but many of them do it much of|tener, for their own plea&s;ure. There are al&s;o &s;everal bathes for the u&s;e of women, who are not allowed to bathe only in the afternoon.&mdash;Tho&s;e among them who are able have the&s;e conveniences in their own hou&s;es, that their women may not go out.</P>

The principal &s;treet extends from the ea&s;t gate of the city, to the we&s;t, is &s;omewhat wide and magnificent. The re&s;t are all very narrow in|commodious and dirty, which renders it very difficult for pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal tolerable edifices without the walls of the city, which add to the beauty of the environs.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e are a variety of Turki&s;h &s;e|pulchres, and monuments. Six of the&s;e mon|uments &s;tand in a circular figure; they were erected to the memory of &s;ix Deys, who were in the cour&s;e of one day, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively elected and murdered.</P>
<P>Algiers had formerly no other water than rain. A Moor, who had been driven out of Spain, con&s;tructed two aqueducts; by which it was &s;oon &s;upplied with abundance of excel|lent water from the adjacent mountains. They have &s;ince con&s;tructed &s;everal others on the &s;ame plan as the two former. The country round this city is exceeding fertile; gardens, groves, and country &s;eats are very numerous.</P>
<P>The Algerines are unacquainted with the art of pruning, and grafting trees..</P>
<P>At Meireija, which is about twelve miles from this city, are three hot bathes, which are natural curio&s;ities. The principal one is 12 feet &s;quare and three feet eight inches deep. The water is quite hot, and when it has filled the large&s;t ba&s;on, it runs through in|to a &s;maller one, where the &s;ews bathe, as they are not permitted to u&s;e the &s;ame bath with
<PB N="60" REF="033747_0059_0FF916E94D3E5D98">

<P>The people of the city of Algiers, in general &s;peak a compound of Arabec, More&s;co, and the remains of the ancient Phenecian langua|ges: but in the country they &s;peak the proper Arabec tongue. The inhabitants of all denom|inations in the city for the mo&s;t part, under|&s;tand the <HI>Lingua Franca.</HI> This is a kind of a dialect, which without being the proper lan|guage of any country whatever, has a kind of univer&s;al currency all over the Mediterrane|an, as the channel of information for people who cannot under&s;tand each other through a|ny medium but this,</P>
<P>The public bu&s;ine&s;s of the nation, and the records are tran&s;acted in the Turki&s;h tongue. The men by their laws and religion, are allow|ed to have four wives (if they are able to pur|cha&s;e them) but they generally content them|&s;elves with two or three.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band never &s;ees his wi&s;e before marriage, but accepts her upon the de&s;cription of her father. If &s;he has no father, the neare&s;t male relative performs this office. By this we may &s;uppo&s;e he has generally a very partial account.</P>
<P>When the match is agreed upon, and the man has paid the father for the daughter (for in this country every man is obliged to buy his wife from her parents,) the bridegroom
<PB N="61" REF="033747_0060_0FF916EB0F8A7848">
&s;ends a pre&s;ent of fruit and &s;weet meats, and entertains her relations with a fea&s;t, and mu&s;i|cal entertainments.</P>
<P>Eight days previous to the marriage, the bride is dre&s;&s;ed in her riche&s;t apparel, and at|tended by four women; no one being allowed to &s;peak to her except her parents, and her four female attendants. At the expiration of which time, the bridegroom is (for the fir&s;t time) conducted into the pre&s;ence of his wife, by the four women above mentioned, who are all veiled.</P>
<P>The&s;e women after having &s;een a certificate from her parents, or neare&s;t &s;urviving relative, lead the man by his hands, to where the bride is &s;itting; when he is before her, &s;he ri&s;es from her &s;eat, and ki&s;&s;es his hands and feet.&mdash;This is a token of obedience &amp; honor to her hu&s;|band. He then retires to his own hou&s;e; and the bride is &s;et on hor&s;eback and led to his dwelling. They are then pronounced hu&s;band and wife, by the four women, of whom I have been &s;peaking. After &s;he is &s;afe delivered to her hu&s;band, the females, who were invited to the nuptial fea&s;t, a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves, and walk through the &s;treets, &amp; at the &s;everal cor|ners they pronounce the bands, to the public, by &s;houting out all together, as loud as they can, and with &s;uch &s;trong &s;hrill voices that they my be heard two miles.</P>

<P>Their longe&s;t jackets, which have &s;leeves, they wear next their &s;hirt, and then a ve&s;t o|ver that, always taking care to have the &s;hort|e&s;t garment out&s;ide.

Stockings are en|tirely unknown among them; they always go with their legs bare. Their &s;hoes have &s;quare toes with no heels.</P>
<P>People of any denomination whatever, (ex|cept the Jews) are allowed to dre&s;s in this ha|bit. No per&s;on is allowed to dre&s;s in green; this colour they hold &s;acred it being a favorite colour of Mahomet. A <HI>&s;herief,</HI> who they &s;ay is de&s;cended from Mahomet, is known by a green turban. The Jews are obliged to dre&s;s entirely in black, and wear &s;hoes without any quarters.</P>

<P>They mark their forehead, chin, and no&s;e, with india ink, and &s;tripe the backs of their hands, and fingers with black, and colour their finger nails red.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent inhabitants of the territory of Algiers are compo&s;ed of many different nati|ons. The Turks, are the fir&s;t people among them, and have all the government and pow|er in their own hands, and no man can hold a|ny po&s;t of great di&s;tinction among them ex|cept he is a real Turk.</P>
<P>The Cologlies, are next the Turks in power. The&s;e are per&s;ons born of a Moori&s;h mother, the Father being a Turk. The Arabs, who trace their de&s;cent from the di&s;ciples of Ma|homet, who formerly &s;ubdued Algiers.&mdash;Moors or More&s;coes, who were driven out of Spain about the end of the &s;ixteenth century. Renegadoes, Levantines, Jews, and Chri&s;tian &s;laves, with a crowd formed of the po&s;terity of all the&s;e different people, make the re&s;t of the population.</P>
<P>The Cologlies, Moors, and Arabs, are the mo&s;t numerous inhabitants of the city and
<PB N="64" REF="033747_0063_0FF8C4ED1FEA5960">
towns. They compo&s;e the great body of the inhabitants. The latter of the&s;e are thieves &amp; murderers by profe&s;&s;ion. Travellers who are led to their country, through motives of curi|o&s;ity or devotion, are &s;truck with terror on approaching the De&s;erts.</P>
<P>The&s;e robbers traver&s;e the country in con&s;i|derable troops, on hor&s;e back: They a&s;&s;ault &amp; plunder the Caravans.</P>
<P>So late as the year 1750, a body of 50,000 Arabians attacked a caravan of Merchants, coming from Mecca, killed 60,000 per&s;ons, &amp; plundered it of every thing valuable, tho' e&s;|corted by a Turki&s;h army.</P>
<P>But it may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a|mid &s;uch a variety of different races, immen&s;e numbers cannot be &s;aid to belong to any parti|cular tribe or nation whatever.</P>
<P>As to the nature of the inhabitants, they are mo&s;tly of a lazy idle di&s;po&s;ition, and cur&s;ed with all the vices of mankind; mi&s;tru&s;tful to the la&s;t degree, fal&s;e, jealous, and the very pic|ture of ignorance! They &s;tile them&s;elves, <HI>Mu&s;&s;elmon,</HI> or true believers; yet there is no confidence to be put in their word, upon any occa&s;ion whatever, except when they promi&s;e to do you an injury, in which promi&s;e they &s;eldom fail, and on which you may &s;afely rely. They are often famed by Spani&s;h hi&s;torians for men of gallantry, but I could never think they are inclined that way, but believe them nearly to equal the Spaniards in cowardice. They are but indifferent &s;oldiers, the greate&s;t part of
<PB N="65" REF="033747_0064_0FF8C4F93AE93510">
their &s;kill con&s;i&s;ts in the management of a hor&s;e, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, they manage the&s;e animals with a great deal of dexterity. They abominate the very name of and culti|vate the mo&s;t inveterate hatred again&s;t Chri&s;|tians, and are continually like ravenous wolves &s;eeking means to de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>Mahomet has taught them in his alcoran, (or koran, for the two names appear to be &s;y|nonymous) that all of his faith who are &s;lain fighting again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, immediately enter into Paradi&s;e in triumph: he even tells them their hor&s;es, if they die in battle, are tran&s;lated into heaven; for they hope to have the plea&s;ure of riding there as well as on earth.</P>
<P>They believe the women have no &s;ouls, and are only formed for propagation; they are therefore not allowed to enter their mo&s;ques, becau&s;e they e&s;teem them incapable of being received into heaven: Yet the women &s;ay their prayers &s;ecretly at home.</P>
<P>The men have u&s;ually a &s;tring of beads in their hands, like the Roman Catholics; and for every bead they have a &s;hort prayer, which, as they repeat, they let drop through their fin|gers. Their prayers con&s;i&s;t only in the diffe|rent attributes of God, as, "God is good,&mdash;God is great&mdash;God is infinite&mdash;God is merci|ful, &amp;c."&mdash;The commanders of tho&s;e wretch|es only differ from their &s;ubjects, in a larger propen&s;ity of their ill qualities, with the addi|tion of a degree of cruelty and avarice.</P>

All foreigners are allowed the free u&s;e of their religion; but the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion in Barbary is Mahometani&s;m. Many of the &s;ub|jects of Morocco follow the tenets of the Ha|med, a modern &s;ectary, and an enemy to the ancient doctrines of the Califs. All of them have much re&s;pect for Idiots&mdash;who&s;e protection in &s;ome ca&s;es, &s;creens offenders from puni&s;h|ment, for notorious crimes.</P>
<P>In the main, however, the Moors of Barbary, as the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;tates are now pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly called, (becau&s;e the Saracens fir&s;t entered Europe from Mauritania, the country of the Moors) have adopted the very wor&s;t parts of the Mahometan Religion, and &s;eem to have retained as much of it as countenances all their vices. The men commit the mo&s;t unna|tural crimes with impunity.</P>
<P>Every one is amazed to find the&s;e people &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and patient under &s;o exce&s;&s;ive and cruel a tyranny: But they &s;hould under&s;tand, (bating their want of power) that they are taught to believe, if they fall by the hand of their king, whom they call Xerif, or Sherief, (which &s;ignifies Mahomet's &s;ucce&s;&s;or) they im|mediately go up to heaven; and tho&s;e who would not willingly be &s;ent to Heaven before their time, mu&s;t be very particular how they conduct them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But &s;till we may derive &s;ome u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons from the&s;e Barbarians. The Algerines and o|ther Mahometans would regard it as the vile&s;t act of prodigality, to &s;ee the lea&s;t mor&s;el of

food wa&s;ted; they would expect to be vi&s;ited with famine, &s;hould they &s;uffer &s;uch wa&s;teful|ne&s;s, as is practi&s;ed in many families in this country. Soon after my arrival at Algiers, as I was returning from my labor at night, and pa&s;&s;ing by a &s;hop, a Turk, who was &s;itting up|on the &s;hop window ordered me to &s;top, and pointing to the ground, told me to take up a &s;mall crumb of bread, which lay upon the pavement, accordingly I took it up and ate it; which the Turk perceiving, he gave me a cake weighing nearly half a pound, and told me, if I had not ate the &s;mall crumb, he &s;hould not have given me the loaf. This was the greate&s;t deed of charity, I ever knew from a Mahome|tan, during my re&s;idence in this wretched place.</P>
<P>Algiers retains the title of a kingdom; it is however a military republic, though it cer|tainly can reflect no lu&s;tre on that &s;pecies of government, The national ordinances run in the&s;e words: <HI>"We, the great, and &s;mall members of the mighty and invincible militia of Algiers."</HI> The Dey is elected by the &s;oldiery. He &s;eldom &s;e|cures his office without tumult &amp; blood-&s;hed; and he often falls by the dagger of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. This &s;overeign, may, with peculiar propriety, adopt the expre&s;&s;ion of one of the heroes of O&s;&s;ian:</P>
<L><HI>Where battle's rag'd, lo! I was born,</HI></L>
<L><HI>'T was there I drew my breath!</HI></L>
<L><HI>And blood mu&s;t mark my lonely &s;teps</HI></L>
<L><HI>Down to the gates of death.</HI></L>
<P><PB N="68" REF="033747_0067_0FF8C4EFDBC8A3F0">
The manner in which his authority is ex|erci&s;ed, corre&s;ponds with that by which it was obtained. The Dey has a corps of guards; a very nece&s;&s;ary, though perhaps a fruitle&s;s precaution; as any private &s;oldier who has the courage to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him, &s;tands an equal chance of becoming his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. An experi|ment of this de&s;cription has been made, &s;ince the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, when &s;ix private &s;oldiers entered into a con&s;piracy to murder the Dey of one of the Barbary &s;tates. They entered his palace, and gave him a mor|tal wound, by thru&s;ting a &s;cymetre into his &s;ide, in the mid&s;t of a croud of people. He fell down and expired, exclaiming; "Has no|body the courage to kill a villain?" One of the con&s;pirators, in&s;tantly a&s;cended the vacant throne, and brandi&s;hing his naked &s;cymitre, declared that he would do ju&s;tice to all! while his five a&s;&s;ociates, were endeavouring to en|force the title of their new &s;overeign, and none pre&s;ent &s;eemed to give them&s;elves any concern about what had happened. He had not remained above ten minutes in this &s;itua|tion, when an old &s;oldier unob&s;erved took aim with a mu&s;ket or blunderbu&s;s, and &s;hot him dead. Upon this, the five others were imme|diately di&s;patched by the people pre&s;ent. Such &s;cenes as the&s;e do not unfrequently occur in tyrannic countries; and ought to teach both rulers and ruled in this happy country ju&s;tly to appreciate the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and good government.

<P>They have but one copper coin, this they call <HI>drahame &s;egaria,</HI> 1160 of which make a dol|lar.</P>
<P>The chief of their diet is bread, oil, olives, vinegar and Sallad. They very &s;eldom eat a|ny meat. When they do, one pound is &s;uffi|cient for &s;ix or eight people, and this they think extravagant. They profe&s;s not to drink any &s;pirituous liquors, and if any one is &s;een intoxicated, he is no more accounted a true Ma|hometan. Many of them will however drink to exce&s;s, when they are out of &s;ight of any others of their religion. Many in&s;tances of this kind I have &s;een; particularly one <HI>Mu&s;tafa,</HI> an Alge|rine, would often go into the <HI>Bagnio,</HI> and pur|cha&s;e wine from the &s;laves, at double price,
<PB N="72" REF="033747_0071_0FF917072F1EF530">
which they had bought for their own u&s;e, and &s;it down and drink among them. One even|ing as I went in after returning from my labor, I &s;aw <HI>Mu&s;tafa</HI> drinking wine, and eating pork &s;au&s;ages. I a&s;ked him if he knew what he was eating, he an&s;wered in great rage, <HI>uz coot &s;anza|fida unta main &s;chelim, una main arf&s;hi,</HI> which in Engli&s;h is, "Hold your tongue you unbeliev|er, if you do not tell me, I &s;hall not know."</P>
<P>They bury their dead in the following man|ner. The corps is wa&s;hed in water, then &s;ew|ed up in a winding &s;heet, put upon a bear, and carried to the grave, where they are buri|ed in a &s;itting po&s;ture. No females are allow|ed to follow any corps whatever. Any Maho|metan who dies with the plague, is carried to the grave as fa&s;t as the bearers can run. All the followers &s;ing while they are going. They imagine all Mahometans who die with this di&s;order are called by the Supreme Being, and are happy to all eternity. But people of any other religion, who die with it, they &s;uppo&s;e are damned. At each end of the grave they place a &s;mall earthen pot, containing about half a pint, which the keep filled with water, pre&s;uming that their friends, if not happy, will be relieved or comforted with their drink.&mdash;They al&s;o plant pea&s;e and beans on the graves of their friends, and lay fragrant bu&s;hes on them, for the comfort and &s;upport of their de|parted relatives. The old women al&s;o every friday morning repair to the man&s;ions of the dead, to carry &s;uch provi&s;ions as bread, beans,
<PB N="73" REF="033747_0072_0FF91708C86B9FD8">
peas, and plumbs. The&s;e they expect their friends if unhappy, will receive; if they are happy, they are willing the cats &s;hould partake the repa&s;t. The&s;e animals croud the grave yards in hundreds.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Dey of Algiers, is between &s;ixty and &s;eventy years of age&mdash;is a thick well built man, with his white beard covering his brea&s;t. He is of a light complexion. Does not appear to be much decayed by the weight of years, which have rolled over his head. He is of a very malicious di&s;po&s;ition; and, often (when he is in a rage) commands deeds of inhumani|ty to be committed, of which it is &s;aid he re|pents afterwards.</P>
<P>His family con&s;i&s;ts of him&s;elf, wife, and one daughter. His wife and daughter have a &s;e|parate palace, at a little di&s;tance from that of the Deys; and have a great number of female Chri&s;tian &s;laves to &s;erve them. The Dey vi|&s;its them every Thur&s;day evening, abides with his wife the night, and returns to his own pa|lace on Friday morning.</P>
<P>The Dey, has al&s;o a number of male Chri&s;ti|an captives, to wait upon him. One cooks his victuals, another &s;ets his table, waits upon him while eating&mdash;makes his bed&mdash;and &s;ees that all things in his apartment are kept clean. The others do any kind of work that is nece&s;|&s;ary. He keeps no Seraglio, as is generally re|ported; he has but one wife, and &s;leeps with her, but once a week.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="033747_0073_0FF9170A9241A520">
When the Dey eats, he has a table about 4 inches high, on which is &s;et &s;everal different di&s;hes, with neither plates, knives or forks, they eat only with &s;poons, their victuals being cut &s;mall before it is &s;et upon the table; and they can touch their victuals only with their right hand. They &s;it always on the floor, (which has a mat or carpet upon it) as chairs are entirely unknown among them. The common people only differ from the Dey, by having no table whatever; their di&s;hes being &s;et upon the floor.</P>
<P>The Turks are a well built robu&s;t people, their complexion not unlike Americans, tho' &s;omewhat larger in &s;tatue, but their dre&s;s, and long beards, make them appear more like mon|&s;ters than human beings. The Cologlies are &s;omewhat le&s;s in &s;tature than the Turks, and are of a more tawney complexion. The Moors or More&s;coes, are generally a tall thin, &s;pare &s;et of people, not much inclining to fat, and of a very dark complexion, much like the Indians in north America. The Arabs, or Arabians, are of a much darker complexion than the Moors, being darker than the Mulat|toes. They are much le&s;s in &s;tature than the Moors, being the &s;malle&s;t people I ever &s;aw; very few arrive at the height of five feet, and are generally near of a &s;ize. The&s;e people com|po&s;e the greater part of the Pi&s;aras, or porters in the city. As they are not allowed to trade in any mercantile line, nor even to learn any mechanic art, they are obliged to be drudges

to their &s;uperiors, to gain the hard earned mor&s;el on which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The Algerines maintain about &s;ix thou&s;and five hundred foot, con&s;i&s;ting of Turks, Colo|glies, or the &s;ons of Soldiers: About one thou|&s;and of them do garri&s;on duty, and part of them are employed in fomenting differences a|mong the neighboring Arab princes. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the Dey can bring two thou&s;and Moor|i&s;h hor&s;e, into the field. Tho&s;e troops are un|der excellent di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>Of their learning, or learned men, little can be &s;aid.</P>
<P>The Turks profe&s;s the greate&s;t contempt for Learning. Greece which was the native coun|try of genius, arts and &s;ciences, produces at pre&s;ent, be&s;ide Turks, numerous bands of Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts and Monks, who, in general, are as ignorant as the Turks them|&s;elves. The education of a Turk &s;eldom ex|tends further than to the reading the Turki&s;h language, and the Koran, and writing a com|mon letter. Some of them under&s;tand a&s;tro|nomy, &s;o far as to calculate the time of an e|clip&s;e; but the&s;e are comparatively few, and regarded as extraordinary per&s;ons. Of litera|ture in modern Turkey, a curious &s;pecimen was printed in the year 1769, at Vienna. The Book, which is a French tran&s;lation, is enti|tled, "A treati&s;e upon Tactics, or an artifici|al method for the di&s;cipline of troops; a work printed and publi&s;hed at Con&s;tantinople, by <HI>Ibrahim Effendi,</HI> officer Mutte ferrika of the Ot|toman

Porte. The original appeared in 1730, and was intended as an experiment for the e&s;|tabli&s;hment of a Turki&s;h pre&s;s. The Turks are &s;aid, upon a &s;uperficial compari&s;on, to have preferred the u&s;e of manu&s;cripts, and the de|&s;ign for want of encouragement was laid a&s;ide. The preface of Ibrahim begins thus: "In the name of the mo&s;t Climent and merciful God, prai&s;es, thanks and benedictions be to the &s;o|vereign ma&s;ter of the empires and kingdoms of the heavens and earth; to the ma&s;ter of Glory and omnipotance, God mo&s;t high and mo&s;t holy, who is the principal and the &s;ource of all order and &s;ymmetry in the univer&s;e, who&s;e &s;upreme will rules the affairs of the &s;ons of Adam, and who&s;e decrees, direct all the ac|tions of men." In this book the writer cen|&s;ures his countrymen, for their negligence as to the acqui&s;ition of modern di&s;cipline. To the curious, an extract from this work may not be altogether unentertaining:&mdash;"In for|mer ages," &s;ays the writer, "when the Chri&s;|tians made le&s;s u&s;e of cannon, mu&s;kets, and granadoes, and when the principal arms of war, were &s;abres, the Mu&s;&s;ulmen, &s;uperior to all nations, in the management of the&s;e wea|pons, made a progre&s;s &s;o rapid, that the chri&s;|tians &s;cattered upon the face of the earth, a&s;|toni&s;hed at their victories and daring no more to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the irre&s;i&s;table force, remained during &s;ome time in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation.

&amp; exploring every re&s;ource without know|ing on what &s;ide to turn them&s;elves, they made a la&s;t effort to invent an expedition pro|per to repair their lo&s;&s;es. At fir&s;t they were unanimou&s;ly de&s;irous to perfect the u&s;e of can|non, of mu&s;kets, and other arms. Afterwards, &s;eeing, that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e was &s;till too weak to &s;upport the impetuous attacks of the mu&s;&s;elmen, and in particular tho&s;e of the Ot|toman armies, they made new attempts, and laboured, all in concert, to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to this fatal de&s;tiny, and to find &s;ome means of re&s;i&s;tance. At la&s;t, after many con&s;ultati|ons and conferrences, the unanimous re&s;ult of their deliberations was, that after having given a better form to their artillery, and their Ar|&s;enals, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to find &s;ome means of &s;ubjecting their unfortunate troops, by certain rules, to a con&s;tant and firm di&s;ci|pline, &s;o that the &s;oldiers re&s;trained in a per|fect order, finding no opportunity of flying, and of de&s;erting their ranks, nor time enough to think of danger and to terrify them&s;elves with the thoughts of in&s;tant death, might per|&s;i&s;t, in &s;pite of their inclination, in their ranks, &s;eeing them&s;elves indi&s;pen&s;ably forced to it.&mdash;Afterwards they thought that it was nece&s;&s;ary to give more con&s;i&s;tency to their lines, ranged in order of battle, and to invent new di&s;cipline, to render them more firm, immovable, and ca|pable of &s;upporting the thundering &s;hock <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the mu&s;&s;elmen, and re&s;i&s;ting their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, which for &s;ome time, being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>The greate&s;t part of their commerce, is with the Sweeds, Danes, Dutch, French, Spaniards, Ragu&s;eans and Engli&s;h. The commodities they trade in, are Wheat, Barley, Oil, Olives, Figs, Rai&s;ins, Wax, Honey, Silks, Almonds, Dates, Wool, Leather of different colors, which is commonly called, Morocco Leather, Hor&s;es, Mules, &amp;c. Their Manufactures are chiefly Silks, and Woolen Carpets. In return, the Europeans furni&s;h them with timber, artil|lery, gun-powder, and whatever they want ei|ther in their public or private capacity. No nations are fond of trading with the&s;e &s;ons of plunder, owing to their capricious de&s;poti&s;m, and the villainy of their Individuals.</P>

<P>The excellence of the climate renders this &s;imple way of living tolerable, though the tents of the&s;e people are mean, their uten&s;ils of

little value, and their lodging filthy. The fa|mily and their dome&s;tic animals lie promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly in the tents together, except the dogs, which are left on the out-&s;ide as guards. They rai&s;e con&s;iderable numbers of bees and &s;ilk|worms. They &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on fruit, rice and bread. Wine and Sprituous liquors, are al|mo&s;t entirely unknown among them. The Dey demands from them a tribute, which is procured by the Beys and carried to Algiers. The manner of gathering this tribute is as fol|lows: The Dey informs the Bey what &s;um mu&s;t be paid, for the en&s;uing year, in the province which he commands or governs. The Bey then goes at the head of a large body of caval|ry to collect it. And many of them on hear|ing of his approach retire to inacce&s;&s;ible places in the mountains, until the troops are with|drawn, in order to evade the payment. If a|ny of tho&s;e who do not ab&s;cond, &s;hould make the lea&s;t equivocation he takes from them whatever he plea&s;e. Should they make any re|&s;i&s;tance, or even intimate that they are di&s;&s;a|ti&s;fied with his proceedings, he cuts off their heads and &s;ends them in triumph to the Dey. And after it has been carried twice from the Deys palace, to the gate <HI>Babazoone,</HI> and expo&s;ed to public view, they then bury it. Tho&s;e Beys &s;eldom are in office more than two or three years, for by this time they have enrich|ed them&s;elves to &s;uch a degree (by plundering and robbing) that the Dey or Divan invents &s;ome crime again&s;t them, for which they are

&s;oon executed, and all their property is brought to the city and depo&s;ited in the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Should any of tho&s;e who retire to the mountains, to evade the payment of the tribute be apprehended, they are put to the mo&s;t ig|nominious death, and all their property is ta|ken for the benefit of the public.</P>
<P>The dre&s;s of the men, is only a coar&s;e wool|en cloth wrapped round the &s;houlders, which falls down as far as their ancles, with a cap of the &s;ame cloth, and a twi&s;ted woolled turban over that. The women pay &s;ome more atten|tion to ornament them&s;elves with dre&s;s. They are dre&s;&s;ed with a long woollen cloth, not un|like that of the men's, with a great number of pewter, and bra&s;s broaches fixed upon it, a|bout the &s;houlders, arms, and brea&s;t. They adorn their heads, with &s;everal of the&s;e broach|es fixed in their hair, and a braided woollen &s;tring pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal times round their heads, which is filled with &s;everal different kinds of flowers.

<P>The economy of the&s;e people, to keep their clothes dry in a &s;torm, is worthy the attention of the reader, I have therefore pre&s;ented the following anecdote to their peru&s;al. One day as I was at work about two miles from the ci|ty, there aro&s;e a very heavy &s;hower of rain, and for my part I would willingly have got under &s;ome tree, or &s;omething el&s;e, if I had been allowed &s;o to do to &s;helter my&s;elf from the tempe&s;t. But ju&s;t before the rain began, I ob&s;erved five of the natives at a &s;mall di&s;tance driving &s;ome mules, loaded with coals, toward the city, who, on perceiving the rain was ap|proaching, very calmly &s;topped their bea&s;ts, and began to undre&s;s them&s;elves. This excit|ed my curio&s;ity to know what they were go|ing about. And as I was digging with a hoe,
<PB N="84" REF="033747_0083_0FF91726E7A89298">
having my back toward them, I immediately turned my&s;elf about and kept at my work with my face the other way, in order to ob&s;erve their proceedings, without neglecting my la|bor, which if I did, I was &s;ure would bring the bloody &s;courge of the unrelenting ta&s;k-ma&s;ter upon my back. I therefore kept &s;teady about my work, and looking at them as often as I dared, ob&s;erved they &s;tripped them&s;elves with a great deal of precipitation; then making their cloathes up in a bundle they took each one a rock about the bigne&s;s of a water pail, and laying the bundle upon the rock, they covered&punc; it with their bodies having their hands and feet upon the ground; all their care was to keep their cloathes &s;ecure from the wet, while their naked bodies were expo&s;ed to the fury of the weather. When it had done raining they took their cloathes in their hands, and drove on their mules a few &s;teps, till they came to &s;ome bu&s;hes, then taking up &s;ome dry leaves that lay under them, and had been kept from the wet by the &s;helter which the bu&s;hes afforded, they wiped each other nearly dry, then dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves and went on. If a per&s;on was &s;een to do &s;o in this country, he would be counted a fool or a madman; however I mu&s;t confe&s;s I thought them &s;omething in the right; for af|ter the &s;torm is over, be it ever &s;o violent, they have dry cloathes on their backs to pur|&s;ue their journey with. This being the fir&s;t time I ever &s;aw this &s;ingular method u&s;ed, if exci|ted &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment, but it being &s;o often prac|ticed,
<PB N="85" REF="033747_0084_0FF9172B581B3808">
it &s;oon became natural. The people in the city, will commonly pull off their &s;hoes, when the &s;treets are muddy and walk bare|footed, to pre&s;erve their &s;hoes from being da|maged. I am informed that tho&s;e who tra|vel on hor&s;e back or on other bea&s;ts, have a bag, covered with an oil-cloth, in which they thru&s;t their cloathes in &s;tormy weather, and ride &s;tark naked. Allowing this to be cu&s;tom|ary among the &s;oldiers, as it probably is, I fancy, if an army of them &s;hould be met in a &s;torm, in this country, it would create a ter|rible fright, and perhaps do as much executi|on to an ignorant body, as their offen&s;ive arms, and oblige them to &s;eek for &s;afety in their heels.</P>
<P>The&s;e wretches have their heads clo&s;e &s;hav|ed, all except one &s;mall lock on the top, which they never cut off; they being taught by the Alcoran, that Mahomet is to draw them up to their imaginary Paradi&s;e by that &s;mall look of hair.

<P>"The beaten path of ignorance they tread."</P>
<P>In a former page I promi&s;ed my readers, a further de&s;cription of Oran, which I &s;hall now endeavour to perform.</P>
<P>Oran is &s;ituated about eighty leagues we&s;t of Algiers; is a mile and an half in circum|ference. It lies partly on a plain and partly on the a&s;cent of a hill, and is well fortified. As the Spani&s;h coa&s;ts and Merchant &s;hips, had &s;uffered much from the cor&s;airs of this port, Ferdinand, King of Spain, determined to at|tempt its reduction. Accordingly he tran&s;|ported into Africa, an army under the com|mand of his prime mini&s;ter, Cardinal Ximen&s;e.&mdash;The wonted good fortune of this officer did not, at this juncture de&s;ert him. He had maintained a corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of the people of Oran; &amp; when the Moors &s;allied out to attack the Spaniards, their perfidious coun|trymen &s;hut the gates again&s;t them. Ximen&s;e killed four thou&s;and of the barbarians, and &s;et at liberty &s;ixteen thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;laves.&mdash;The Algerines, during near two hundred years made frequent but un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to re|cover it. In 1708, they retook it. In June, 1732, a Spani&s;h army was landed not far from Oran. The Turki&s;h troops and the inhabi|tants were &s;eized with a panic, and abandoned their fortifications without any re&s;i&s;tance. The Moors not long after attacked it with great fu|ry, but were finally repul&s;ed, with much
<PB N="87" REF="033747_0086_0FF9172D2A66A510">
&s;laughter. The Spaniards continued in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it until the year 1791, when the Algerines went with a &s;trong force again&s;t it, under the command of Alli Bey of <HI>Ma&s;cara.</HI> After a &s;iege of &s;everal days, they withdrew their troops, having received much damage.&mdash;In 1792, the Dey of Algiers, and the King of Spain having agreed upon terms, very ad|ventageous to the former, Oran was given up to the Algerines, and is &s;till in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. During the &s;ixty years, the Spaniards had this place in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; their &s;oldiers kept continually de&s;erting. The Algerines u&s;ed the greate&s;t economy to prevent tho&s;e at Oran, from knowing how the de&s;erters fared. By this means they were daily adding to their number of &s;laves, as the &s;oldiers &s;uppo&s;ed they would be at liberty, if they de&s;erted to their e|nemy. But contrary to every law of humani|ty, a&s;&s;oon as they were in the hands of the Al|gerines, they were made &s;laves, and deprived of the little liberty they enjoyed while under the Banner, of his Catholic Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, were about five hundred of them, when I left Algiers. The King of Spain it cannot be rea&s;onably expected, will pay a &s;um of money to ran&s;om people who de&s;erted from his &s;ervice, and by that means involved them&s;elves in this predicament, therefore they have no hopes of relief till death. There is a &s;tory that the Dey, in one of his letters to the King of Spain, de&s;ired to know if he intended to redeem tho&s;e &s;laves from Oran. To which
<PB N="88" REF="033747_0087_0FF9173009A5E110">
the King replied, that, if the Dey would &s;alt them in barrels, he would purcha&s;e them at the price of &s;alted beef.</P>

<P>As their power encrea&s;ed, their ambitious views extended with a &s;till greater rapidity; for while they were acting as pirates, and rob|bers, they arrogated the ideas, and acquired the talents of, Conquerers. The prizes which they took on the coa&s;ts of Spain, France, and Italy, they often carried into the ports of Bar|bary. The &s;ituation of the&s;e harbors being &s;o very commodious for the &s;ecurity of their Cor|&s;airs; and to add to this convenience, their vicinity to the greate&s;t commercial ports at that time in Chri&s;tendom, rai&s;ed an ambitious de&s;ire in the brea&s;t of tho&s;e infamous pirates, for an e&s;tabli&s;hment in that country. For ac|compli&s;hing this project, an opportunity &s;oon pre&s;ented it&s;elf, which the brothers, did not &s;uffer to pa&s;s unimproved. The King of Al|giers, at this time, who was called Eutemi,
<PB N="93" REF="033747_0092_0FF91744A5EC4850">
having made &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fort. which was built not far from his capital, by the Spani&s;h Governors of Oran, applied to Barbaro&s;&s;a for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The villain as may be &s;uppo&s;ed gladly accepted the propo&s;al, and left the fleet under the com|mand of his brother Hayradin. He then marched with five thou&s;and men to Algiers, and was received with all the honors due to the commander in chief of &s;uch an army, by the Algerines, who &s;uppo&s;ed him come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not having the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of his ba&s;e de&s;igns. His ambitious de&s;ires of becoming great among the inhabitants of that part of the globe, had now an opportunity of being put in execution, and every thing &s;eem|ed to promi&s;e him &s;ucce&s;s. This great force had given him the command of the City, and indeed every thing &s;eemed to favour the per|petration of his diabolical plot. He therefore murdered &s;ecretly the monarch, who had &s;oli|cited his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. and whom he had come to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and proclaimed him&s;elf king in his &s;tead. He e&s;tabli&s;hed the authority which he had u&s;ur|ped, by arts &s;uited to the genius of the people whom he had to govern; for his liberality to tho&s;e who favored his promotion, was without bounds, and to tho&s;e whom he had any rea&s;on to mi&s;tru&s;t, that wi&s;hed to oppo&s;e his authority his cruelties were no le&s;s unbounded. With his fleets, which re&s;embled the armaments of a great monarch, rather than the &s;quadrons of a pirate, he continued to infe&s;t the coa&s;ts of
<PB N="94" REF="033747_0093_0FF9174660119C28">
Spain and Italy, for by this time he had increa&s;|ed the number of his cor&s;airs to upwards of 50 armed ve&s;&s;els. The repeated and cruel deva&s;|tations of his cor&s;airs upon tho&s;e coa&s;ts, obliged Charles the Vth, about the begining of his reign, to furni&s;h the Marquis de Comares, who was then Governor of Oran, with a &s;ufficient number of troops to attack him. That officer executed his commi&s;&s;ion with &s;uch &s;pirit and re&s;olution, that the forces of Babaro&s;&s;a were vanqui&s;hed in &s;everal encounters, and he him|&s;elf was &s;hut up in Treme&s;en, where he re|mained blockaded for &s;everal months, and was at la&s;t fortunately &s;lain, as he was attempting to make his e&s;cape. His brother Hayradin, who was likewi&s;e known by the name of Barbaro&s;|&s;a, a&s;&s;umed the Algerine &s;ceptre. For &s;ome time he carried on his naval robberies with the utmo&s;t vigour, and on the continent of Africa, he even extended his conque&s;ts. But perceiv|ing at length that the Moors and Arabs never &s;ubmitted to his de&s;potic mandates, but with the utmo&s;t reluctance, and being apprehen&s;ive lea&s;t his continual depredations would one day draw upon him the arms of the Chri&s;tians, he put his dominions under the protection of the grand Seignior, from whom he received a &s;uffi|cient body of Turki&s;h &s;oldiers, for his &s;ecurity again&s;t his foreign as well as dome&s;tic enemies.</P>
<P>The infamy, (or, as Doctor Robert&s;on &s;ee proper to call it, the <HI>&s;ame</HI>) of his exploits daily increa&s;ed, till at length <HI>Solyman,</HI> approving of
<PB N="95" REF="033747_0094_0FF8C4FD71BB3B50">
his conduct offered him the command of the Turki&s;h fleet; and on the other hand, Hayra|din, ju&s;tly dreading the fatal con&s;equences, which might ari&s;e from the tyranny of his of|ficers over the Algerines, &s;olicited the protec|tion of the grand &s;eignior. This was immedi|ately granted, and Hayradin him&s;elf appoint|ed Ba&s;haw, or vice roy of Algiers; by the means of which he received &s;uch numerous reinforcements from Turkey, that the unhap|py Algerines dur&s;t not make the lea&s;t com|plaint, and were now under the woeful nece&s;&s;i|ty of re&s;igning their per&s;ons, and property to the will of this de&s;potic prince. Exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e Turks who were &s;ent him by the grand &s;eignior as &s;oldiers, &s;uch numbers flocked to him, voluntarily, that he was not only capable in a con&s;iderable degree of annoying the Chri&s;|tians with his cor&s;airs at &s;ea, but al&s;o of keep|ing the Moors, and Arabs in &s;ubjection at home. About this time he began the foundation of the mole, which I have before de&s;cribed. Hay|radin had by this time rendered him&s;elf dread|ed not only by the Arabs, and Moors, but al&s;o by the maritime chri&s;tian powers, e&s;pecially by the Spaniards. The vice roy &s;ailed not to ac|quaint the Grand Seignior with his &s;ucce&s;s, who being much plea&s;ed with his proceedings, furni&s;hed him with a fre&s;h &s;uppy of money, by means of which he was enabled to build tho&s;e &s;orts and batteries before mentioned. The Sultan, in the mean time, either out of a &s;en&s;e of the &s;ervices of Hayradin, or perhaps being

<P>This new Ba&s;haw immediately on taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new government, began to pur&s;ue his ravages, on the coa&s;ts of Spain, and Italy with greater fury than <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> any of his predece&s;&s;ors had done, he even extended them to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, and other parts of Ita|ly did not e&s;cape his rapine. The&s;e proceed|ings greatly alarmed, Pope Paul 3d who exhor|ted the emperor Charles 5th to &s;end a power|ful fleet to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e diabolical repeated piracies: and lea&s;t &s;omething might be wanting to render this daring enterprize &s;ucce&s;sful, his holine&s;s publi&s;hed a bull, wherein a plenary ab|&s;olution of &s;ins, and the crown of martyrdom, were promi&s;ed to all tho&s;e who fell in battle or were made &s;laves. The emperor, needed no incitement on his part&punc; he therefore &s;et &s;ail at the head of a powerful fleet, which con&s;i&s;ted of one hundred and twenty three large &s;hips, and twenty gallies of different &s;izes, having on board thirty thou&s;and well diciplined troops, with an immen&s;e quantity of arms and ammu|nition. The reduction of Algiers was &s;o ap|parently inevitable at this time, that many of the young nobility, and gentlemen attended

this expedition as volunteers, and among the&s;e were many knights of Malta, remarkable for their valour again&s;t the enemies of Chri&s;tiani|ty. Many ladies of birth and character attend|ed Charles; A va&s;t number of the officers and &s;oldiers, took their wives and children with them, intending to &s;ettle in Barbary, after the conque&s;t was fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>About the beginning of October, A. D. 1541, they arrived off the harbor. The &s;ight of &s;uch a prodigious armament threw the Algerines into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation as their city was &s;urrounded only by a wall, with &s;carce any out works, and their whole garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of only eight hundred Turks, and &s;ix thou&s;and Moors, who were chiefly without fire arms, and poorly di&s;ciplined and accoutred; the re&s;t of their forces being di&s;per&s;ed in different pro|vinces of the kingdom, to levy the u&s;ual tri|bute on the Arabs and Moors. The Spaniards landed their forces without any oppo&s;ition whatever, and immediately built a large fort on a hill about a mile to the ea&s;tward of the ci|ty, under the cannon of which they encamp|ed. The city at this time being dependant on one &s;pring for its water, which was one mile from the walls and the Spaniards, having di|verted its cour&s;e, they were now reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. Ha&s;&s;an received a &s;um|mons from Charles, to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, on pain of being put to the &s;word with all his garri&s;on if he refu&s;ed. The herald was order|ed to extol the va&s;t power of the emperor, both
<PB N="98" REF="033747_0097_0FF9174ECDB71BC0">
by &s;ea &amp; land, and to exhort him to return to the Chri&s;tian religion. To this Ha&s;&s;an replied, that <HI>he mu&s;t be a madman, who would pretend to advi&s;e an enemy, and that the per&s;on advi&s;ed, would act &s;till more madly &s;hould he take coun&s;el of &s;uch an ad|vi&s;er.</HI> He was, however upon the point of &s;ur|rendering the city, when he received intelli|gence, that the forces belonging to the we&s;tern government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was determined to de|fend it, to the utmo&s;t. In the mean time, Charles being re&s;olved upon a general a&s;&s;ault, kept up a cannonade without intermi&s;&s;ion, upon the town, which from the weak defence made by the garri&s;on, he looked upon as already in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But while the Divan were delibe|rating on the mo&s;t proper means of obtaining an honourable capitulation, a mad prophet, at|tended by a multitude of people, entered the a&s;&s;embly, and foretold the de&s;truction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhort|ing the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was &s;oon accompli&s;hed in a very &s;urpri&s;ing and unexpected manner; for on the 28th of October 1541, a dreadful &s;torm of rain, hail and wind, aro&s;e from the north|ward, attended with violent &s;hocks of earth|quakes, and a di&s;mal and univer&s;al darkne&s;s both by &s;ea and land; &s;o that the &s;un, moon, and elements, &s;eemed to combine together for the de&s;truction of the Spaniards. Eighty &s;ix &s;hips, and fifteen gallies, were de&s;troyed in that one night, with all their crews, and mili|tary
<PB N="99" REF="033747_0098_0FF91752EF79EE40">
&s;tores, and the Algerines &s;ay in le&s;s than half an hour, by which the army on &s;hore was deprived of all means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. Their camp al&s;o, which &s;pread it&s;elf along the plain, under cover of the cannon of their fort, was laid quite under water by the dreadful tor|rents which de&s;cended from the neighboring hills. Many of the troops were cut to pieces by the Moors, and Arabs by trying to remove into &s;ome better &s;ituation; while &s;everal gal|lies, and other ve&s;&s;els, endeavouring to gain &s;ome neighboring creeks along the coa&s;t, were immediately plundered, and their crews ma&s;&s;a|cred by the inhabitants. Next morning; Charles, to his utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, beheld the &s;ea covered with the fragments of his &s;hips, and the bodies of men, hor&s;es, and other crea|tures &s;wimming upon the waves, the &s;ight of which &s;o di&s;heartened him, that abandoning his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, to the enemy, he marched at the head of his army in the greate&s;t precipitation and di&s;order towards Cape Mallabux, in order to re-embark, on board tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, which had out-weather|ed the &s;torm. But Ha&s;&s;an, was not an idle &s;pec|tator all this while, for he had &s;o narrowly watch|ed the motion of the Spaniards, that he allowed them ju&s;t time enough to get to the &s;hore, when he &s;allied out &amp; attacked them with the greate&s;t fury, in the mid&s;t of their hurry to get into the &s;hips. The Spaniards, however made an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, and a very bloody carnage continued for about two hours, when they
<PB N="100" REF="033747_0099_0FF9184C1BCC8038">
were over-powered, and obliged to retreat to their boats, the whole number of which was not capable of carrying one quarter of them. Ha&s;&s;an pur&s;ued them to their boats, and killed a va&s;t number, and brought away a &s;till greater number of captives; after which he returned in triumph to Algiers. The prophet Yu&s;ef, who had foretold the de&s;truction of the Spani|ards, was &s;oon after this declared the deliverer of his country, and had a con&s;iderable gratuity decreed him, with the liberty of exerci&s;ing his prophetic functions unmole&s;ted. It was not long however, before a &s;trong oppo&s;ition was made again&s;t him, by &s;ome of the interpreters of the law, by remon&s;trating to the Dey, how ridiculous and &s;candalous, it was to their nati|on, to a&s;cribe its deliverance to a poor fortune|teller, which had been obtained by the fervent prayers of an eminent &s;aint of their own pro|fe&s;&s;ion. The Ba&s;haw, and his Divan, &s;eemed, out of policy, to give way to this la&s;t notion; yet the impre&s;&s;ion which the prediction of Yu|&s;ef, and its accompli&s;hments had made upon the minds of the common people, proved too &s;trong to eradicated; &s;ince which the &s;pirit of divination and conjuring, has got into &s;uch credit among them, that not only their great &s;tatesmen, but their prie&s;ts, and &s;antoons, have applied them&s;elves to that &s;tudy, and dignified it with the name of the Revelations of Maho|met.</P>
<P>The Spaniards had &s;carcely reached their &s;hips, when a &s;econd &s;torm attacked them, in
<PB N="101" REF="033747_0100_0FF917D20FB9C1C0">
which a va&s;t va&s;t number more of them peri&s;h|ed. One ve&s;&s;el in particular, with &s;even hun|dred &s;oldiers, and three hundred &s;eamen on board, &s;unk, in the pre&s;ence of Charles, with|out a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;aving one man. At length with great difficulty the &s;urvivors reached the port of Bujeyah, a &s;mall port on the coa&s;t of Barbary, which lies about thirty five leagues to the ea&s;tward of Algiers, and was at this time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Spain. They remained here only till the &s;ixteenth of November, and then &s;et &s;ail for Carthagena, (in Spain,) at which place they arrived on the 25th of the &s;ame Month. Upwards of one hundred and twenty &s;hips and gallies, were lo&s;t, in this unfortunate expediti|on, with above three hundred officers, and eight thou&s;and &s;oldiers, be&s;ides mariners, ex|clu&s;ive of tho&s;e de&s;troyed by the enemy on their re-embarkation, or peri&s;hed in the la&s;t &s;torm, and tho&s;e who were made &s;laves. The number of pri&s;oners was now &s;o great, that &s;ome of them were &s;old, by the Algerines, by way of contempt, for an <HI>Onion</HI> per head!</P>
<P>The Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines, in any con&s;iderable degree, after this time. In the year 1555, Salab Bai&s;e, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Ha&s;&s;an, attacked the city of Bujeyah, and &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, though not without an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance from the Span|iards, and great &s;laughter on both &s;ides. Salab Bai&s;e now augmented the number of Chri&s;tian &s;laves, to thirty one thou&s;and. The next year, this commander's ambition being rai&s;ed
<PB N="102" REF="033747_0101_0FF917D9CD9D13B0">
with the &s;ucce&s;s he met at Bujeyah, he &s;et out upon a new expedition, &s;uppo&s;ed to be again&s;t Oran, but was &s;carce got out of the city, when he was attacked with the plague which made its appearance in his groin, and fortunately carried him off, in twenty four hours. The plague at this time raging very violently in the city, and among the troops, the &s;oldiery im|mediately elected a Cor&s;ican renegado, Ha&s;&s;an|Cor&s;o, in his &s;tead, in order to execute the in|tended expedition again&s;t Oran. He accepted the Ba&s;haw&s;hip with much difficulty, di&s;patch|ing a me&s;&s;enger at the &s;ame time to acquaint the porte, with what had happened, and marched his army again&s;t Oran, they had &s;carcely commenced their ho&s;tilities again&s;t that place, when orders were received from the porte, expre&s;&s;ly forbiding Ha&s;&s;an-Cor&s;o to be|gin the &s;iege; or, if it was begun enjoining him immediately to rai&s;e it, which he did ac|cordingly. This officer had enjoyed his digni|ty but four months, when a new Ba&s;haw, Te|kelli, arrived from Con&s;tantinople, as his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. The Algerines re&s;olved not to admit him; but by the treachery of the Levantine &s;oldiers, he at la&s;t entered. He immediately ordered Cor&s;o, to be thrown upon the hooks which are fa&s;tened in the walls of city, one of which catching him by the ribs of his &s;ide, he hung in this horrid agony, three days before he expired. Tekelli, was inhumanly murder|ed &s;hortly after, under the cupola of a &s;aint, by Yu&s;ef Calabres, a favourite renegade, of
<PB N="103" REF="033747_0102_0FF8C58A1B0A39D8">
Ha&s;&s;an-Cor&s;o. The murderer was immediate|ly cho&s;en in his &s;tead, but died of the plague, &s;ix days after his election. Yu&s;ef's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was Ha&s;&s;an, the &s;on of Hayradin, Barbaro&s;&s;a. Not long after, the Spaniards undertook an expedition again&s;t Mo&s;tagan under the com|mand of the court D'Alcandela, but were ut|terly defeated, the commander &s;lain, and twelve thou&s;and men taken pri&s;oners. Ha&s;&s;an having di&s;obliged his &s;ubjects, they &s;ent him in irons to Con&s;tantinople, and two Turki&s;h of|ficers &s;upplied his place. Ha&s;&s;an was cleared, but Achmet was appointed a new Ba&s;haw.&mdash;Immediately upon his arrival at Algiers, he &s;ent the two deputy-Ba&s;haws to Con&s;tantinople. where they were beheaded. Achmet died in four months after; and Ha&s;&s;an was &s;ent a third time Vice-Roy to Algiers, Soon after his arrival he engaged in the &s;eige of Mar&s;alqui|ver, (a town of Algiers, &s;ituate on the Barbary coa&s;t of Africa, lying oppo&s;ite to Oran,) which at this time, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards; and &s;ituated at a &s;mall di&s;tance from Oran. He planted the Ottoman &s;tandard &s;everal times upon the walls, which the Spaniards as often di&s;lodged; and Ha&s;&s;an was finally obliged to rai&s;e the &s;eige, after great &s;laughter on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>In the year 1567, Ha&s;&s;an was again recalled to Con&s;tantinople. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Mahomet, incorporated the Jani&s;aries and Levantine Turks together. Thus he put an end to their di&s;&s;entions, and the foundation of the Algerine
<PB N="104" REF="033747_0103_0FF917EB36C57FE8">
independency on the porte, was now laid. He erected &s;everal fortifications which he intended to render impregnable.</P>
<P>About this time, one Juan Ga&s;con, an intre|pid Spaniard, formed a de&s;ign of de&s;troying the whole piratic navy, as they lay in the bay, by &s;etting them on fire in the night. He was furni&s;hed by Philip the 2d, with ve&s;&s;els, fire|works, and mariners, for the execntion of his plan. He failed for Algiers in the begining of October, when the greate&s;t part of the Cor&s;airs lay at anchor in the bay; and advanced near enough to view them, undi&s;covered. He ac|cordingly, unperceived by any, came to the mole, and di&s;patched his men, with their fire|works but the&s;e being &s;o badly mixed, that they could not be kindled. Ga&s;con now find|ing him&s;elf di&s;covered, and in the utmo&s;t danger got his &s;hips under way with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, and &s;tood to &s;ea; but was pur&s;ued, over|taken, and brought back a pri&s;oner. Maho|met immediately cau&s;ed a gibbet to be erected on the &s;pot where Ga&s;con landed, and hung him by the feet upon a hook, with his com|mi&s;&s;ion tied to his toes. He had been &s;u&s;pend|ed in this &s;ituation, but a &s;hort time, when the captain who made him pri&s;oner, and &s;everal other officers, interceeded &s;o &s;trongly in his be|half, that he was taken down, and put under the care of a chri&s;tian &s;urgeon. A few days after, it being reported that it was the com|mon talk and belief in Spain, that the Alge|rines dur&s;t not hurt a hair of Gu&s;con's head,
<PB N="105" REF="033747_0104_0FF917F1A969F1A8">
he was carried to the top of the execution wall, and thrown down. In his fall a hook catched him by the belly, which tore out, &s;o he fell to the bottom and was da&s;hed to pieces.</P>
<P>Mahomet was &s;ucceeded by Ochali, a rene|gado, who &s;ubdued the kingdom of Tunis. It remained &s;ubject to the ba&s;haw of Algiers un|til the year 1586, a Ba&s;haw of Tunis, was then appointed by the grand Seignior.</P>
<P>Algiers continued to be governed by the Turki&s;h Vice Roys or Ba&s;haws, till the begin|ning of the &s;eventeenth century.

The Divan elected a Dey from among them&s;elves. A new &s;et of laws was com|piled, and they made &s;everal regulations, for the better &s;upport of this new government.

endeavouring to recover their former power, and the other to curtail it, cau&s;ed &s;uch frequent complaints and di&s;contents at the Ottoman court, as made them &s;ometimes repent of their compliance.</P>
<P>The Spaniards made another attempt upon Algiers, in the year 1601, but by contrary winds their fleet was driven back, &s;o that this time they came off without lo&s;s. Such num|bers of Moors, being expelled from Spain in the year 1609, that they flocked to Algiers in abundance; and many of them being able &s;ail|ors, they undoubtedly contributed to make the Algerine fleet &s;o formidable as it &s;oon became. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Moors are de&s;cended from the Saracens, who at the end of the 7th Century, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the fine&s;t kingdoms of A&s;ia and Africa and not content with the immen&s;e region that formerly compo&s;ed great part of the A&s;&s;yrian Per&s;ian, Macedonian, and Roman Empires, cro&s;&s;ed the Me|diterranean ravaged Spain, and e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves in its &s;outhern pro|vinces. They were &s;uperior to all their contemporaries in arts and arms, and held po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne nearly 300 years. Learning flouri&s;hed in Spain, while the re&s;t of Europe was buried in Ignorance and barbarity. A &s;eries of civil wars continued to depopulate Spain until about the year 1492, when all the Kingdoms of Spain (Portugal excepted) were united by the mar|riage of Ferdinand, King of Arragon, and I&s;abella, the heire&s;s, and afterwards King of Ca&s;tile. They took Grenada, and in the beginning of the 17th century, the Moors and Jews who would not become Converts to the chri&s;|tian faith, were to the number of one hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and families, driven out of Spain. This depopulation of Spain of Labourers, Manufac|turers and Seamen, added greatly to the internal growth and &s;trength of Al|giers, as well as to the increa&s;e of its navy.</NOTE> In 1616, their naval force con&s;i&s;ted of forty large &s;hips, be&s;ide Xebecs, row-galley's &amp;c. their Admiral &s;hip at this time was upwards of five hundred tons burthen. Their fleet was divided into two &s;quadrons, one of eighteen &s;ail, was &s;tationed off the port of Malaga; and the other

off the Cape Santa Maria, between Li&s;bon and Seville; both of which annoyed Chri&s;tian &s;hips &amp; plundered both Engli&s;h &amp; French, with whom they pretended to be in friend&s;hip, as well as Spaniards and Portugue&s;e with whom they were at war.</P>
<P>The Algerines were now become formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards who were mo&s;t expo&s;ed to danger, &s;olicited the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of England, the Pope and other &s;tates. The French however were the fir&s;t who dared to &s;hew their re&s;entment at the perfidious be|havior of the&s;e mi&s;creants; and in the year 1617, M. Beauleau was &s;ent again&s;t them with a fleet of fifty men of war. He defeated their fleet, and took two of their ve&s;&s;els. Their Ad|miral &s;unk his own &s;hip rather than fall into the hands of the enemy. The Engli&s;h &s;ent a &s;quadron of men of war again&s;t Algiers in the year 1620, but they returned without do|ing or &s;u&s;taining any material damage. The Algerines daily becoming more in&s;olent and daring, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only excepted, to whom, in 1625 they &s;ent a propo&s;al, that if they would &s;it out twenty &s;ail of &s;hips in the following year, upon any &s;ervice again&s;t the Spaniards, the cor&s;airs would join them with &s;ixty &s;ail. In 1626, the Cologlies &s;eized on the Citadel, and nearly ac|compli&s;hed their de&s;ign, of making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city. The Turks and Renega|does, attacked them with great fury, and de|feated them with terrible &s;laughter. Va&s;t

numbers were beheaded, and their heads thrown in heaps upon the walls of the city.&mdash;The Algerines, and other &s;tate of Barbary, threw off their dependence on the porte, in the year 1623. Sultan Amurath 4th, had been o|bliged to make a truce with the Emperor Fer|dinand 2d; for the term of twenty five years, and as this put a &s;top to the piratical trade of the Algerines, they re&s;olved, that whoever de|&s;ired to be at peace with them, mu&s;t, &s;eparately apply to their own government. They made prizes of &s;everal merchant &s;hips, belonging to the powers at peace with the porte. At Scan|deroon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A town of A &s;iatic Turkey, &s;ituate on the coa&s;t of A&s;ia Minor.

About this time Louis 13th, undertook to built a fort on their coa&s;t, in&s;tead of one formerly built at the Mar&s;ilians, and which had been demoli&s;hed. This, after much difficulty, he accompli&s;hed; and it was called the Ba&s;tion of France; but the &s;ituation being found inconvenient, the French purcha&s;ed the port of La Calle, and obtained liberty to trade with the Arabs and Moors. In the mean time, the Ottoman court, was &s;o much embar|ra&s;&s;ed with a Per&s;ian war, that they had no lei|&s;ure
<PB N="109" REF="033747_0108_0FF9180C5B9FCED0">
to check the Algerine piracies. The Vi|zier, and other courtiers, took this opportuni|ty to compound matters with the Algerines, and to get a &s;hare of the prizes, which were very con&s;iderable. A &s;evere reprimand ac|compined with threats, was &s;ent them, merely for &s;ake of form. They replied, that "they de&s;erved to be indulged in the&s;e depredations, as they were the only bulwark again&s;t the Chri&s;tian powers, and in particular, again&s;t the Spaniards, the &s;worn enemies to the Mo&s;|lem name" they added, that "if they &s;hould pay a punctilious regard to all who could pur|cha&s;e liberty to trade with the Ottoman em|pire, they "would have nothing to do but &s;et &s;ire to their &s;hipping, and turn camel-drivers."</P>
<P>The Algerines pro&s;ecuted their piracies with impunity, to the terror and di&s;grace of Chri&s;tendom, till the year 1652; when a French fleet being driven to Algiers accidentally, the admiral thought proper to demand a re|lea&s;e of all the Captives belonging to his nation indi&s;criminately, which the Dey refu&s;ing to comply with the Frenchman without any fur|ther ceremony carried off the Turki&s;h viceroy, and his Cadi or Judge, who were ju&s;t arrived from the porte, with all their equipage and retinue. By way of repri&s;al the Algerines &s;urpri&s;ed the Ba&s;tion of France, already men|tioned, and carried off &s;ix hundred inhabitants, with all their effects. Sixteen galleys and galliots were &s;itted out &s;oon after by the Alge|rines, under the command of Alli Penchinin.

The chief de&s;ign of this armament was again&s;t the trea&s;ure of Loretto in Italy; but being pre|vented by contrary winds from obtaining their de&s;ire, they made a de&s;cent on Puglia in the king|dom of Naples; where the whole territory of Necotra, &s;uffered by their ravages, and a va&s;t number of captives were carried to Algiers. They then &s;teered towards Dalmatia, &amp; &s;cour|ed the Adriatic, loading them&s;elves with immen&s;e trea&s;ure. Such ravages greatly alarm|ed the Venetians, who immediately &s;ent admiral Capello, with twenty eight &s;ail of &s;hips again&s;t them, with expre&s;s orders to burn, &s;ink or take, every Barbary cor&s;air he might meet with, either at &s;ea, or in the Ottoman harbours, agreeable to their late treaty with the Porte. The Rais Ba&s;haw being at &s;ea at this time with a Turki&s;h fleet, in order to drive the Malte&s;e and Florentine crui&s;ers from the Archipelago, and being informed that the Algerine &s;quadron was very near, &s;ent expre&s;s orders to the Alge|rine admiral to come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

At length Pinchinin ventured out, and a de&s;|perate engagement en&s;ued, which continued for about four hours, with the mo&s;t determi|ned

ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides, at la&s;t Pinchinin fled, and was pur&s;ued by Capello; but the pirates &s;hips &s;ailing fa&s;ter than their enemy, they made their e&s;cape.

In this action the pirates lo&s;t, in killed, one thou&s;and five hundred men, Turks, and Chri&s;tian &s;laves, and one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred galley &s;laves &s;et at liberty by Capel|lo. The pirates, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where they were again watched by the Venetians, but the latter had not been long at his old &s;tation, before a letter was &s;ent him from his court, de&s;iring him not to make any farther attempts at that time, le&s;t it might be the occa&s;ion of a rupture with the Porte. Ca|pello being forced to &s;ubmit; he re&s;olved to take his leave of them in &s;uch a manner, as he tho't they de&s;erved; ob&s;erving how their tents &amp; equipage were drawn along the &s;hore, he kept firing among them, while &s;ome &s;hips were di&s;|patched to attack their &s;quadron. They towed out &s;ixteen of the pirates gallies, with all their cannon and &s;tores. A ball from one of the Venetian gallies having &s;truck a Turki&s;h mo&s;que, the whole action was con&s;idered as an in&s;ult upon the grand Seignior. To conceal this orders were given to Capello to &s;ink all the &s;hips he had taken from the Algerines, except the Admiral; which was to be laid up at Ve|nice as a trophy. Capello received a &s;evere re|primand from his court, and the Venetians were obliged to pay to the porte, five hun|dred

thou&s;and ducats, by way of attonement. The news of this defeat, filled Algiers, with rage and confu&s;ion. They immediately ap|plied to the porte, for an order, that the Ve|netians who were &s;ettled in the Levant, (the ea&s;t part of the Mediterranean &s;ea,) &s;hould make their lo&s;s good. But the grand &s;eignior refu&s;ed to comply with this, and left them to repair their lo&s;&s;es in the be&s;t manner they could. The pirates however &s;oon recovered their for|mer &s;trength, being able at the end of two years to &s;end a fleet of &s;ixty five &s;ail to &s;ea.</P>
<P>The Algerines having committed &s;uch grie|vous outrages on the coa&s;ts of Provence and Languedoc, that Louis the 14th, was provoked in the year 1682, to &s;end a very, large &s;leet a|gain&s;t them, under the command of the Man|quis du Que&s;ne, vice Admiral of Prance. He arrived off Algiers in Augu&s;t, and gave the Ci|ty &s;uch a furious bombarding and cannonading, that in a &s;hort time, it was greatly damaged, and the great Mo&s;que battered down.

commenced the action in the morning, and threw one hundred bombs into it, which did terrible execution, while the Algerines di&s;|charged &s;everal hundreds of cannon again&s;t the a&s;&s;ailants without doing any material damage. On the following night great numbers of bombs were again thrown into the city, which nearly demoli&s;hed the Dey's palace, and &s;eve|ral great edifices; &s;ome ve&s;&s;els were &s;unk in the harbor and &s;everal batteries di&s;mounted.</P>
<P>The Dey and &s;oldiery being greatly alarm|ed at the terrible havock, &s;ued for peace.&mdash;As a preliminary, the French demanded all chri&s;tian captives who had been taken un|der the French flag, which was immedi|ately granted, and one hundred and forty two per&s;ons were directly given up, with a promi&s;e of &s;ending on board the re&s;t as &s;oon as they could be brought from the different parts of the country.

The Dey being embarra&s;&s;ed with this la&s;t de|mand, he a&s;&s;embled the Divan, and acquainted them with it.

part, he would never con&s;ent to deliver up any thing which they had taken from the French. He immediately acquainted the &s;oldiery with tho&s;e new demands, and of what had pa&s;&s;ed in the a&s;&s;embly; which &s;o exa&s;perated them, that they ma&s;&s;acred the Dey that very night, and the next day cho&s;e Mezomorto in his &s;tead. This being done, all the articles of peace which had been made were de&s;troyed, and ho&s;tilities re|newed with greater fury than ever. Du Que&s;|ne now kept pouring in &s;uch volleys of bombs, that the greate&s;t part of the city was almo&s;t re|duced to ruins, in le&s;s than three days; the numbers of &s;lain were &s;o great that their blood run in rivulets along the &s;treets. Mezomorto was unmoved by all the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, but had ra|ther grown de&s;perate and furious, he &s;ought only how to wreak his revenge on the enemy. He cau&s;ed all the French in the city to be in|humanely ma&s;&s;acred, and not contented with this, he ordered their Con&s;ul to be fa&s;tened a|live to the mouth of a mortar, from which he was &s;hot away again&s;t their navy. Du Que&s;ne was &s;o exa&s;perated, with this piece of barbarity that he did not leave Algiers till he had utterly de&s;troyed all their fortifications, and &s;hipping; and had reduced the city to a heap of ruins.&mdash;The Algerines &s;oon after this, &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y into France, begging in the mo&s;t abject terms for peace; which Louis readily granted.

With a conci&s;e account of the expedition of the Spaniards in 1775, I &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter.</P>
<P>On the 23d or June, 1775, a &s;leet con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix &s;hips of the line, twelve frigates, and thirty three other armed ve&s;&s;els &s;et &s;ail from Carthagena, in Spain, to attack Algiers. The troops which were on board amounted to twenty four thou&s;and four hundred and forty &s;even men, including calvalry, infantry, ma|rines, and &s;ix hundred de&s;erters de&s;tined to &s;erve as workmen. They were commanded by the count O'Reilly, a per&s;onal favourite of the late king of Spain. For the land &s;ervice they had an hundred and &s;eventy &s;ix pieces of artil|lery, mortars, and howitzers, with a &s;ufficient quantity of military &s;tores. They anchored in the bay of Algiers, on the 30th of June, and 1&s;t of July. Next day a council was held, and the troops were ordered to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to di&s;embark on the en&s;uing morn|ing by day break. But as the &s;ucceeding night was windy, and a &s;well had &s;et in from the North, their orders were countermanded.&mdash;From this day, to the &s;ixth, there were fre|quent councils, violent debates and nothing done. A quarrel broke out between O'Reilly and the Marquis de Romane, a Spani&s;h major|general, who was killed in the &s;ub&s;equent ac|tion. On the &s;ixth, the principal officers were again a&s;&s;embled, to receive their ultimate in|&s;tructions. O'Reilly warned the army, that the cu&s;tom of the Algerines, was, to pretend a mo&s;t violent attack, and to fly with precipita|tion,
<PB N="116" REF="033747_0115_0FF918333AD86C30">
on the &s;malle&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, that they might draw the enemy into an ambu&s;cade. He cau|tioned the troops not to break their ranks, as nothing but the force of di&s;cipline could &s;ecure them again&s;t &s;o active an enemy. The very error which they committed, and the &s;nare into which they were betrayed, was pointed out of them, by O'Reilly. The army was di|rected (on their landing) to gain &s;ome heights, which were &s;uppo&s;ed requi&s;ite to en&s;ure &s;uc|ce&s;s again&s;t Algiers. In the afternoon of the &s;ame day &s;ome &s;hips of war were ordered to fire again&s;t three batteries a little to the ea&s;t|ward of the city. This commi&s;&s;ion was execu|ted with &s;o much laudable attention to the per&s;onal &s;afety of the a&s;&s;ailants, that their &s;hot <HI>did not reach the &s;hore,</HI> tho&s;e of one &s;eventy four gun &s;hip excepted, and not one of tho&s;e &s;truck either of the batteries. This dreadful Spani&s;h attack cea&s;ed about &s;un&s;et. Between eight &amp; nine thou&s;and men were put on board the boats the next morning at day break in order for landing. They advanced under the pro|tection of their &s;hips very near the coa&s;t. Not a per&s;on appeared to oppo&s;e them; <HI>but le&s;t they might be attacked, and for their own &s;afety</HI> they <HI>returned on board the tran&s;ports</HI> at &s;even o'clock in the morning. Not a &s;ingle &s;hot was fired on either &s;ide during this whole day. On the 8th at day break, the &s;hips were &s;tationed to batter the different forts to the right and le&s;t of the place of di&s;embarkation, eight thou&s;and troops were put on board the boats; which

formed in &s;ix colums. The place of landing was about a league to the ea&s;tward of the city. Sixty or &s;eventy thou&s;and Barbarians, of whom the greate&s;t part were cavalry, came in &s;ight, but did not attempt to oppo&s;e the landing of the Spaniards. The troops advanced into a clo&s;e country, which the Algerines had occupi|ed in &s;mall parties. The light infantry and grenadiers of the Spaniards were &s;oon repul&s;ed, and the whole body fell into confu&s;ion. In a very &s;hort time they fled, leaving behind them a great number of killed and wounded. Part of a &s;econd body of troops, who were ju&s;t land|ed, added to the general confu&s;ion. A third body had ca&s;t up an entrenchment on &s;hore, for the protection of the army. The Africans attacked it, but were driven back, with great laughter on both &s;ides. The Algemines attack|ed them a &s;econd time, driving before them va&s;t numbers of camels which &s;erved to &s;hield them in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the balls of the Spaniards. They advanced in this manner within a &s;hort di&s;tance of the Spani&s;h forces, when a &s;harp engagement took place which con|tinued about half an hour, the Spaniards were then put to flight, leaving behind them fifteen pieces of cannon, three howitzers, and all their dead and wounded, the latter were all put to the &s;word, and the head of every Spaniard, whether dead or alive,) was &s;truck off&mdash;The Dey having offered a reward of ten Sequins for each head that &s;hould be brought him.

The Algerines &s;tate the lo&s;s of the Spa|niards, to be nine thou&s;and five hundred and &s;even, and their own at about one thou&s;and two hundred. This latter &s;tatement is per|haps nigher the truth than the former, by rea|&s;on of the Algerines being &s;creened in a con&s;i|erable degree from the fire of their enemy, by the camels, whom they drove in front. The real amount of the lo&s;s on either &s;ide is very diffi|cult to determine, but one circum&s;tance is ev|ident, that the bones of &s;everal thou&s;and Spa|niards are laying above ground to this day, in the valley where they were &s;lain, they not being allowed a burial by the Algerines.</P>

<P>At this dreadful news, we de&s;paired of ever ta&s;ting the &s;weets of liberty again.

<P>The Republican government of the United States have &s;et an example of humanity to all the governments of the world. Our relief was matter of admiration to mercile&s;s Barbarians.

<P>P. S.

I &s;hall therefore always be ready to communicate &s;uch intelligence, un|til &s;ome nearer, and better channel of commu|nication can be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This letter was accompanied by another from Mr. Montgomery, authori&s;ing the Swedi&s;h Con|&s;ul, to make the before-mentioned propo&s;al to the Dey, and to offer payment to the Regency, for the time of all Americans, that the Dey

would be plea&s;ed to let go, to any garden, or hou&s;e, to re&s;ide until this dreadful &s;torm of mortality &s;hould be over.</P>
<P>Accordingly when the plague &s;pread its a|larm in the city, Mr. Skjoldebrand went to the Dey with this propo&s;al, to which the execra|ble &s;on of I&s;hmael replied in words to this purpo&s;e, <HI>"Does the American Government &s;uppo&s;e, I am going to do my work my&s;elf, when I have &s;o many &s;laves; or do they think to make an A&s;s of me, by hiring my &s;laves, to live in idlene&s;s. No while they have life, they &s;hall work, and if they die with the plague, it will be my lo&s;s, not theirs!"</HI></P>
<P>About the fir&s;t of February, 1794, &s;everal Americans were attacked with the &s;mall pox. Of this epidemical di&s;ea&s;e, four of my country|men died in the cour&s;e of the month, as fol|lows, Samuel Milborne, chief mate of the &s;hip Minerva, belonging to Philadelphia, Richard Wood, mate of the brig Olive Branch of Port&s;|mouth (N. H.) John Mott, mariner, of the for|mer ve&s;&s;el, and Thomas Furnace, Cabin boy, of the latter. A &s;hort time after, the city was alarmed with the plague. This fatal and con|tagious, di&s;order, carried off many Americans, whom I &s;hall name, in the li&s;t of Americans, (captured by the Algerines) in the latter part of this book. About the la&s;t of april, a Dutch Ad|miral arrived in the bay, with four &s;ail of the line, and two frigates, and in a few days effect|ed a peace with the Regency. He ran&s;omed all the Dutch captives, which the Algerines, had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It being an old cu&s;tom a|mong

the Algerines, when they make a peace with any Chri&s;tian nation, to oblige that nation to ran&s;om the Dey's chief &s;ervant, and the &s;weeper of his palace, &s;hould they be of a dif|ferent nation, from the captives liberated.&mdash;Accordingly, when the Dutch ran&s;omed their captives, they al&s;o ran&s;omed one Philip Sloan, an American, who was captured in the year '75 on board the Ship Dolphin of Philadelphia; commanded by Richard O'Brien, he being at this time the &s;weeper of the palace.</P>
<P>In the month of September, '94, the Alge|rines captured two hundred and one Cor&s;icans. The manner of capturing them was &s;omewhat &s;ingular. The Cor&s;icans, while they were un|der the government of France, had licence from the Dey of Algiers, to fi&s;h for Coral on the coa&s;t of Africa, from the bay of Bona, to the I|&s;land Gallette.

They &s;ailed under the convoy of an armed brig. Having been a few days upon the coa&s;t, a French crui&s;ing frigate cap|tured their convoy, and &s;everal, of their boats.

their flag, (which is a white field with a Moors head in the centre,) and thinking this too delicious a mor&s;el to pa&s;s unnoticed, con&s;i|ned them all in the Mortimore or dungeon, and &s;ecured their boats. He then &s;ent and in|formed the Dey of Algiers, what he had done, a&s;king his orders concerning them. The Dey being always willing to catch at every opportu|nity of plundering, and thinking this too valu|able a gem to e&s;cape his predatory rapine, he commanded them all to be brought to Algiers, and made &s;laves, which was accordingly done. They remained in captivity until the month of March '96. And were then ran&s;omed by the Engli&s;h, at the rate of 1,200, dollars each: And the Engli&s;h made the following addition to their former Treaty. The Algerines may carry their prizes into Cor&s;ica, and &s;ell them publicly. Every month a packet &s;hall carry letters from and to Cor&s;ica, to and from Al|giers. The Engli&s;h &s;hall take nothing which they find on board the Algerine ve&s;&s;els, and if any difficulties, &s;hall ari&s;e, the Dey &s;hall decide upon it. The Dey (for the &s;tipulated &s;um of 1,200 dollars each) grants liberty to all &s;laves now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion who were born in the I|&s;land of Cor&s;ica, and permits the Cor&s;icans to fi&s;h for Coral upon the coa&s;ts of Barbary.</P>
<P>On the 24th of April '95, we had the &s;atis|faction of being deprived of the mo&s;t Tyrannic guardian, or ta&s;k-ma&s;ter, we ever had during my captivity. He was know by the name of Sherief. This cruel villain never appeared to be

be in his element, except when he was cruelly puni&s;hing &s;ome Chri&s;tian captives. On the day before mentioned; he with another ta&s;k|ma&s;ter being &s;ent with twenty &s;laves, to re|move a pile of boards, which was in a maga|zine, upon the walls of the city, and he having beat &s;everal &s;laves, unmercifully without any provocation; an American exclaimed (in the Engli&s;h language, which the Turk did not un|der&s;tand,) "God grant you may die, the fir&s;t time you offer to abu&s;e another man." A few minutes afterwards, as a &s;lave was going upon &s;ome plank, which was laid from the fir&s;t wall to the &s;econd, having his load upon his back. Sherief thinking he did not proceed as fa&s;t as he might, ran and endeavoring to &s;trike him, mi&s;&s;ed his &s;troke; his &s;tick gave him &s;uch a &s;udden jirk, that he fell from the planks, be|tween the walls, and was da&s;hed to pieces.&mdash;Thus ended the days of a godle&s;s wretch, ap|parently in a moment, &s;wept away by the de|vout breath of a &s;uffering Chri&s;tian; to the great joy and &s;ati&s;faction of all the &s;laves be|longing to the regency.</P>
<P>On the 28th of Augu&s;t, an Engli&s;h privateer Xebec, belonging to Gibralter was crui&s;ing on the coa&s;t, off Oran, and being in want of pro|vi&s;ions &s;ent her boat on &s;hore, to purcha&s;e &s;ome; As &s;oon as the boat landed, the barba|rians demanded of the officer, his pa&s;&s;port for the ve&s;&s;el, and being told it was on board, they &s;ent off a boat, and very politely invited the Captain, to enter the port, with his ve&s;&s;el, and
<PB N="133" REF="033747_0132_0FF9187A247B9980">
purcha&s;e, what he &s;tood in need of. He ac|cordingly went in and brought his ve&s;&s;el to an anchor. No &s;ooner was this done than they demanded of him, his pa&s;&s;port, which was im|mediately produced. On examining it, they found it was for a &s;quare rigged ve&s;&s;el, and his privateer being a Xebec, it excited &s;u&s;picion. They therefore, confined the captain and crew, and &s;ent them in irons to Algiers. The Dey on &s;eeing the pa&s;&s;port, declared the ve&s;&s;el and crew to be Genoe&s;e, with fal&s;e papers, he ac|cordingly condemned them as &s;uch. They re|mained eight months, in captivity, and were then liberated by the Briti&s;h government.</P>
<P>We heard many encouraging reports, dur|ing our captivity, but none proved to be fact, until the month of July 1795, when a ve&s;&s;el arrived from Gibralter, and brought us the joyful news, that David Humphreys, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> and Jo&s;eph Donald&s;on, Jun. <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> had arrived at that place, from America, a few days previous to her &s;ailing, and that Mr. Donald&s;on was de&s;ti|ned for Algiers, to effect a peace between the Regency, and the United States of America.&mdash;This news was confirmed about the tenth of Augu&s;t, when a Spani&s;h courier arrived from Alicant, with a letter from Mr. Donald&s;on, (who was then at that place) directed to the Dey of Algiers, the contents of which was to obtain the Dey's permi&s;&s;ion for him to come and conclude a peace between the two nations. The Dey at this time being very anxious, to have an American Amba&s;&s;ador come, and ne|gociate

with him for a peace, and the redemp|tion of the captives, and wi&s;hing to have af|fairs amicably &s;ettled between him and the U|nited States, he chartered a Ragu&s;ean polacre, and &s;ent her to Alicant, to bring Mr. Donald|&s;on to Algiers. She &s;ailed on the eleventh of Augu&s;t, and when &s;he had been fourteen or &s;ixteen days ab&s;ent, and not hearing any thing from her, our &s;pirits were very much damped, fearing &s;ome mi&s;hap had befallen her; as eight or ten days is &s;ufficient to perform this voyage with a common chance of winds. We how|ever, feared the wor&s;t and hoped for the be&s;t, until the joyful day at la&s;t arrived. Thur&s;day, the 3d of September, 1795, the wind being a|bout W. b. S. at nine A. M. &s;aw a &s;ail from the marine bearing N. b. W. &s;tanding directly for the harbour. At eleven, A.

<P>It now being too late for him to &s;ee the Dey that night, he was obliged to refer the negociation till Saturday. Friday the 4th be|ing the Mahometan Sabbath, he could not do any kind of bu&s;ine&s;s with the Dey. The &s;u&s;|pence, the hope, fear, and agitation we &s;uffer|ed this day, may be conceived, but not de&s;cri|bed. An amba&s;&s;ador to redeem us had arrived. What would be his &s;ucce&s;s we knew not&mdash;a whole day was pa&s;&s;ing away and nothing done. Never was there a longer, more tedious day in the annals of &s;lavery&mdash;Again we mu&s;t repair to our man&s;ion of mi&s;ery, and in &s;u&s;pence wear out a night of &s;leeple&s;s anxiety.</P>
<P>Saturday, the 5th about 11 A. M. Mr. Do|nald&s;on was invited into the Dey's pre&s;ence.&mdash;Accordingly he went and about twelve o'clock a peace was concluded. The American flag was then hoi&s;ted on board the Ragu&s;ean pola|cre, and the banner of the United States was &s;aluted from the ca&s;tles of Fenelle and Corda|lares, with the thunders of twenty one can|non. Sounds more ravi&s;hing never vibrated in the air; our hearts hearts were joy. We imagined our&s;elves already free men. In idea, our chains were falling off, &amp; our ta&s;k-ma&s;ters no longer at liberty to torture us. In imagi|nation we were already traver&s;ing the ocean; hailing our native &s;hore; embracing our pa|rents, our children and our wives. This de|lirium of joy was of &s;hort duration; like a

dazzling meteor in a dark night, which blazes for a moment, making &s;ucceeding darkne&s;s more dreadful; our enchanting hopes left us to de&s;pondency, horrible beyond de&s;cription. In about five hours we were informed that the cup of our &s;ufferings was not yet drained;&mdash;that we could not be relea&s;ed till our ran&s;om was paid! Never was there a more &s;udden or affecting change in the countenances and con|ver&s;ations of men. In&s;tead of &s;prightly looks, cheerful congratulations and &s;anguine anticipa|tions of fini&s;hed bli&s;s; there was nothing but faces of &s;adne&s;s and the mo&s;t gloomy &s;ilence, interrupted only with &s;ounds of complaint, or &s;ighs of di&s;pair. "Not relea&s;ed till our ran|&s;om is paid!" How long, &s;aid we, may our country neglect us? How many fatalities be|fall our redemption on its pa&s;&s;age! How many di&s;appointments may yet occur! How long may our chains and torments be continued!</P>
<P>After we had done work that evening and retired to our gloomy Bagnio; I was infor|med, by the Dey's Chri&s;tian Clerk, that my|&s;elf, Abiel Willis, and Thomas Billings, mu&s;t immediately repair to the amba&s;&s;ador's hou&s;e! he accordingly procured permi&s;&s;ion from the keeper of the pri&s;on, to let us pa&s;s out. On our arrival at Mr. Donald&s;on's hou&s;e, he in|formed us that the Dey had granted him three captives, as &s;ervants to him, and that he was under an obligation to pay a certain &s;um to the Regency for our labour, that he was likewi&s;e re&s;pon&s;ible for our good behaviour, and hoped
<PB N="137" REF="033747_0136_0FF918927B8AF738">
we &s;hould behave our&s;elves accordingly. We remained with him and Mr. Barlow, in the ca|pacity of &s;ervants., from this day, until the day of our liberation. This was a great favour, conferred on us, for now we were exempted from the labour and torture of the&s;e execrable ta&s;k ma&s;ters, but &s;till we were &s;laves. Di&s;gui&s;e thy&s;elf as thou wilt, &s;till, &s;lavery, thou art a bitter draught.</P>
<P>On Friday the 11th, Captain O'Brien, was liberated by Mr. Donald&s;on, and di&s;patched by him from Algiers, on board a Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;el, with di&s;patches for Mr. Humphreys, who was at this time in Li&s;bon. We had information, about five weeks afterwards, that Capt O'Bri|en arrived at Malaga, after a pa&s;&s;age of &s;even days, and that he took pa&s;&s;age from thence for Li&s;bon, by land. This again revived our hopes, and every ve&s;&s;el that appeared in &s;ight, we con|jectured, was bringing the money for our re|demption. But what perturbations we &s;uffer|ed, during this period, is far beyond my pow|ers of de&s;cription. Month after month, was pa&s;&s;ing away, and ve&s;&s;el after ve&s;&s;el arriving, but no tidings of our manumi&s;&s;ion. In this mo&s;t gloomy &s;ituation we worried out four long months, an had almo&s;t de&s;paired of ev|er being relea&s;ed, and were beginning to be|lieve that all we had heard or &s;een, was a phan|tom, intended only to illure our hopes, and then leave us in immen&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments, as an <HI>Ignis &s;atuus</HI> doth the heedle&s;s traveller.

the middle of January 1796, Mr. Donald&s;on informed us, that he had received letters from Mr. Humphreys, and expected the money for our redemption would be in Algiers, within ten or twelve days. This in &s;ome mea&s;ure al|leviated our drooping &s;pirits; however, we were &s;till fearful, lea&s;t the Dey &s;hould take um|brage at &s;uch long delays, and order Mr. Do|nald&s;on away, break the truce, &amp; recommence ho&s;tilities. Should this happen we knew our awful de&s;tiny, which would be to &s;pend our days in &s;lavery.</P>
<P>In this &s;u&s;pence we continued until the mid|dle of March, and no money arrived, when (O! horrible tidings) we under&s;tood that the Dey had got impatient with the delay of the money, and had ordered Mr. Donald&s;on to leave the place, and declared he would &s;end out his cor&s;airs and bring in every American ve&s;&s;el they met with, and that he would never make a peace with the United States, during his reign. Now again we were de&s;pondent, and not without a rea&s;on. Con&s;ider reader, what mu&s;t have been our feelings at this time. For me to attempt, to de&s;cribe them, would be endeavouring to effect an impo&s;&s;ibility. I therefore leave the reader to judge from his own brea&s;t, what terrible convul&s;ions mu&s;t have been rai&s;ed in ours, at this dilemma; after &s;o many enchanting hopes, had appeared, that we &s;hould be left to this de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of March, a brig arrived in the bay, with the American colours over her &s;tern,
<PB N="139" REF="033747_0138_0FF8C59B6A4A6698">
and &s;he proved to be the Sally of Philadelphia, commanded by&mdash;March, from Mar&s;eilles. She brought as a pa&s;&s;enger Joel Barlow, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> Con&s;ul General of the United States of Ame|rica, for the city and kingdom of Algiers. The Dey gave him liberty to land, as a private gen|tlemen, but not to perform the functions of his office. This worthy gentleman, who&s;e com|pa&s;&s;ionate &s;ervices for his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed country|men, can never be e&s;timated too highly, nor prai&s;ed too much, gave us all the encourage|ment he could; a&s;&s;uring us, he would never quit Algiers, and leave us in &s;lavery. While we were in this &s;u&s;pence, we received the fol|lowing letter from Col. David Humphreys, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> who likewi&s;e faithfully did for us all that could be done.</P>

<P>THE object of this letter is to a&s;|&s;ure you, that you are neither forgotten or neglected by your country.

<P>A few days afterwards, Mr. Barlow, (thro' the interce&s;&s;ion of the Sweedi&s;h Con&s;ul, and &s;ome of the principal officers of the Regency, who had great influence with the Dey.) ob|tained permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ee this de&s;potic Algerine prince; with whom he made new arrange|ments, and obtained a further indulgence of three months to procure the money in. Our hopes were again revived with the&s;e new ne|gociations, and we meditated a po&s;&s;ibility of
<PB N="141" REF="033747_0140_0FF918A7988B0908">
his obtaining it, before the time &s;pecified &s;hould expire.</P>
<P>About the fir&s;t of April, Mr. Donald&s;on &s;ailed from Algiers de&s;tined for Leghorn, on board a Venetian &s;hip, and we were informed that his mi&s;&s;ion, was to procure the money for our redemption. At the time of his depar|ture, the Plague that fatal epidemical di&s;order, had &s;pread its alarm in the country adjacent. And which &s;oon made its appearance (for the &s;econd time, during my captivity) in the city, and which put a period to the exi&s;tence of ma|ny of my fellow-countrymen, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the li&s;t of Ve&s;&s;els and Crews captured by the Algorines.</NOTE> when they were expecting every day to be called free men.</P>
<P>The long and tedious days pa&s;&s;ed, as they had done before, with the expectation of Li|berty, in every coming &s;ail. But (O! hor|rible to relate) at length the time &s;pecified was expired and no money had arrived, and we ex|pected every moment to hear the awful &s;en|tence, of Slavery for life, pa&s;&s;ed upon us.&mdash;What el&s;e could we expect or even hope from a ferocious ab&s;olute Monarch, like Ha&s;&s;an Ba|&s;haw, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Dey of Algines.</NOTE> one of the genuine children of I&s;hmael, who&s;e "hands was again&s;t every man, and e|very man's hand again&s;t him." But in&s;tead of the terrible &s;entence of continued &s;lavery, the next &s;ound which echoed in our ears, was the joyful news, <HI>of approaching Liberty.</HI> For
<PB N="142" REF="033747_0141_0FF918AAC548B110">
<HI>(the ever be prai&s;ed)</HI> Mr. Barlow, on &s;eeing the time, wherein the money was to be produced, was already pa&s;&s;ed, and neither tidings, nor money appeared, and being fearful lea&s;t the Dey, &s;hould be again exa&s;perated with its de|lay, he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t efforts to procure it in Algiers. He accordingly abtained a promi&s;e from <HI>Mr. Machio Baccri,</HI> (who was a Jew be|longing to the Regency) that he would ad|vance him, one hundred and eighty thou&s;and dollars, in the cour&s;e of three of four days, which was ju&s;t the &s;um required for the Re|demption of the American captives. The Dey (on being informed of this by Mr. Bar|low) at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to let us go, becau&s;e the money to pay for the peace had not arrived, however he at la&s;t con&s;ented to take it, and &s;et us at liberty. On the 5th of July, we were informed by a letter from Mr. Barlow that we might expect to be at liberty within three or four days. But advi&s;ed us not to put too much dependence, for &s;ays he, "the heart of your Pharoah may be again hardened." He however a&s;&s;ured us that he had no doubt but we &s;hould be free men within three days: for as the Dey had agreed to accept the money, it &s;hould be paid as &s;oon as it could be counted. This filled our hearts with joy, and we imagin|ed our&s;elves the happie&s;t people in the world. For a long period we had been &s;uffering the mo&s;t inhuman &s;lavery; loaded with almo&s;t an in&s;upportable weight of chains, and were now expecting to enjoy Liberty; the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;|ing

human beings ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. And our ex|pectations at this time were not vi&s;ionary nor unfounded, as had &s;o often been the ca&s;e with us before, for it proved to be a happy reality. What a joyful night was this. We pa&s;&s;ed it with prai&s;es to our kind deliverer. And &s;an|guine anticipations of en&s;uing freedom. Our &s;toney floors on which we laid, were apparent|ly &s;ofter than beds of down. The chains on our legs were &s;eemingly of on weight. Our cruel ta&s;k-ma&s;ters now looked on us, with &s;miling countenances, and congratulated us, on our good fortune, in the following &s;ingular manner: <HI>"Sanzafidas droak imche il blaedic, ila kelp ou Romi."</HI> Which in Engli&s;h is thus, "you unbelievers, now your are going to the country of Chri&s;tian dogs."</P>
<P>On the 10th at day break in the morning, all hands were called as u&s;ual. And a few minutes before the time, that the doors are o|pened for the &s;laves to go out to work; we were notified by the Bagnio-keeper, that all the people taken under the American flag mu&s;t &s;tay in the Bagnio, and hold them&s;elves in rea|dine&s;s to go to the Dey's palace, and receive our <HI>ti&s;caras,</HI> or pa&s;&s;-ports from the Dey; and that we &s;hould be embarked the next morning. However it &s;o happened, that the Dey could not attend, to give us our <HI>tiscaras</HI> that night, though he received the money. This long and tedious night was &s;pent, in anxious expec|tation of hearing the &s;weet &s;ound of Liberty echo in our ears, on the approaching morning.
<PB N="144" REF="033747_0143_0FF918B4CE5ED928">
And O! glorious event, this was the ultimate night we ever &s;pent, in that gloomy dungeon, that horrible man&s;ion of wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>On the 11th we were again notified by the Bagnio Keeper, that we mu&s;t be ready to go to the Dey's palace, for our pa&s;&s;-port. A &s;hort time after the &s;laves of other nations had gone out to work we were all called out of the Bag|nio, into the &s;treet, where we were received by the Dey's chief clerk, who conducted us to the palace, and there each man received his <HI>ti&s;|cara</HI> from the Dey. The &s;weeper of the palace at this time, being a Venetian, he was liberated according to cu&s;tom. At 9 o'clock, A. M. we all embarked on board a &s;hip, belonging to Mr. Machio Baccri. This ve&s;&s;el had formerly been an Engli&s;h tran&s;port (the Bridget of London) had been captured by the French Republicans, and brought into Algiers, and there condemned. On board of this &s;hip were al&s;o forty eight Neapolitans, who had been ran&s;omed a few days before us. Oh! what a glorious &s;ight, now could we behold the &s;tripes and &s;tars fly|ing with honor, where they had &s;o often been hoi&s;ted with contempt. Every tongue was ut|tering, <HI>long live the humane benevolent Barlow.&mdash;O! Happy day, O! Happy day.</HI></P>
<P>While we (Americans) were enjoying the fruits of this happy event, there was nothing to be heard, from the &s;laves of other nations, but the mo&s;t bitter cur&s;es heaped upon their governments, and Sovereigns. They being

chiefly of the Roman Catholic Religion, are taught, that they are the only true Chri&s;tians, and having now &s;een the Dutch, and Ameri|cans liberated, and they neglected, it exa&s;pera|ted them to &s;uch a degree, that they would ex|claim in the mo&s;t violent language again&s;t their Prie&s;ts, Sovereigns, and religion. "Why," &s;aid they, "are we, who are true Chri&s;tians, un|noticed, by our country and &s;uffered to remain here in &s;lavery, while the Prote&s;tants, (who are no more than degenerated chri&s;tians) are daily emancipated, and are not &s;uffered to wear the yoke of &s;lavery." They would &s;ay to each other, "Behold what examples of hu|manity, are now &s;et by the Prote&s;tants, and how little they are noticed by the Roman Ca|tholic governments." The&s;e and &s;imilar ex|pre&s;&s;ions, were in the mouths of every &s;lave, whom we left behind.</P>

<P>On the 12th we received the provi&s;ion on board, and got the &s;hip ready for &s;ea. On this day Jo&s;eph Rogers, belonging to Sali&s;bu|ry, on Merimack river, paid the great debt of

<P>On the 13th at 5 A. M. we got under way and &s;tood to &s;ea, at 7 A.

We were &s;upplied with provi&s;ions by the American Con&s;ul.</P>
<P>On the 7th of October, we were vi&s;ited ear|ly in the morning, by &s;everal Doctors, who finding us all in good health, ordered us to be &s;moaked at the &s;moke hou&s;e, and then gave us <HI>Praddick.</HI> At 9, A.

<P>On the 8th, I &s;hipped my&s;elf in the capacity of fir&s;t mate on board the &s;hip Fortune of Phi|ladelphia, commanded by Michael Smith. This is the &s;hip which brought us from Algiers, and during our quarantine, &s;he was purcha&s;ed by Mr. Donald&s;on, who gave her the name of For|tune, he being at this time in Leghorn. On the 13th of November, a Sweedi&s;h &s;hip &s;ailed from Mar&s;cilles, bound to Philadelphia, and carried as pa&s;&s;engers all the Americans, (late pri&s;oners in Algiers) except tho&s;e who tarried on board the Fortune.</P>
<P>On the 17th November we &s;ailed from Mar|&s;eilles, bound to Bona, (in the &s;tate of Algiers) where we arrived after a pa&s;&s;age of twenty days, which brought it to the 7th of December.&mdash;
<PB N="148" REF="033747_0147_0FF918CB5F7033D8">
Bona is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame place with the ancient Hippo, a &s;ea port, built by the ancients. It was formerly the metropolis of the province of Bona. It lies on a bay of the Mediterrane|an &s;ea, in lat. 36, 45 N. and 7, 53 ea&s;t long. a|bout two hundred and eighty miles to the ea&s;tward of the city of Algiers, and about fifty &s;even miles S. W. from the I&s;land Gallette.&mdash;Near Bona, is La Callee, which is at pre&s;ent oc|cuped by the French, who pay an annual tri|bute to the Dey of Algiers for the privilege of the coral fi&s;hery. In this place is a French factory, where the Moors and Arabs di&s;po&s;e of their produce. Bona is about two miles in circumference; it was formerly a magnificent city, but at pre&s;ent is a town of very little im|portance, and of &s;lender population. It is de|pended by a fortre&s;s, and a garri&s;on of Turks, and what is &s;ufficient to a&s;certain the depth of its wretchedne&s;s, (as well as in all other parts of the territory) is, that a Turk is the mo&s;t re&s;pectable character among them. In this part of the world, elegant architecture, has for many years, been utterly forgotten or de&s;pi&s;ed. The buildings are therefore very mean, and are expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of the Arabs&mdash;The name of the&s;e people is u&s;ed in a very in|determinate manner. Although Algiers is at a very long di&s;tance from Arabia, yet as this part of Africa was formerly &s;ubdued by the Arabians, under the banner of Mahomet, the name is &s;till applied to a race of dark complec|tioned, independent Barbarians, who &s;pread

Bona is computed to contain about nine thou|&s;and inhabitants, who are compo&s;ed of the po&s;|terity of many different nations. It has their mo&s;ques, which are &s;omewhat larger than the other buildings, though the&s;e are by no means magnificent. It is commanded by an <HI>Alcaid</HI> who pays an annual tribute to the Dey of Al|giers, in wheat, butter, honey, and oil. The former grandeur of this city, is now only to be traced in the remains, and ruins of an an|cient mona&s;tery. Near the river Sef Gomar, &amp; not far from Con&s;tantina <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The capital of a province of the &s;ame name in Algiers.</NOTE> is an ancient and noble bridge; which is built acro&s;s a valley. This bridge has five arches, and extends from one mountain to another.

Near this is a very large &s;ubter|raneous aqueduct, which terminates in a ca&s;|cade. It is reported that &s;tate criminals are &s;ometimes precipitated down this place, and are da&s;hed to pieces upon the rocks at the bottom.</P>

<P>The I&s;land of Elba lies in the Mediterrane|an &s;ea, about twelve leagues, W. S.

<P>When the French took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Leghorn, which is the capital &s;ea-port of Tu&s;cany, and obliged the Engli&s;h to flee, the latter by way of retaliation, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Porto Ferrajo, into which place they carried, and condemned their prizes at this time, but returned it to the Grand Duke about the beginning of May, '97.

We &s;ailed for Leghorn on the 23d, and arrived on the 24th, and were kept in quarantine un|til the 5th of March, on which day Captain Smith arrived from Porto Ferrajo. The rea&s;on of our being put into quarantine at this time was on account of our having come from Barbary, as there is a law among all Chri&s;tian nations, who border on the Mediterranean;&mdash;that when any ve&s;&s;el arrives in their ports, the commander of &s;uch ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t &s;hew his bill of health, and affirm that his ve&s;&s;el has not been boarded by any ve&s;&s;el of war or any ve&s;&s;el whatever, having come from Barbary, before he can get permi&s;&s;ion to go on &s;hore. If his ve&s;&s;el has been boarded by any of the above mentioned ve&s;&s;els, or his la&s;t port was one of tho&s;e of Barbary, he and his ve&s;&s;el are obliged to ride a quarantine. And as the la&s;t port we &s;ailed from, in the Fortune, was Bona, before we were taken by the Engli&s;h, we were liable to this quarantine, but the Engli&s;h command|er, on his arrival at Porto Ferrajo, went im|mediately on &s;hore without having obtained permi&s;&s;ion, in con&s;equence of which the whole I&s;land was put into quarantine, and any boat, ve&s;&s;el, or per&s;on, going from this I&s;land while it was under this re&s;triction, were obliged to perform their quarantine in the port where they arrived.</P>
<P>On the 10th, Captain Smith &s;ailed from Mar&s;eilles, on board a polacre belonging to Genoa, taking with him all the remainder of the Fortune's crew, except my&s;elf and Mo&s;es

Brown: Brown, at this time being &s;ick in the ho&s;pital, was not able to proceed; but &s;oon af|ter recovered his health and went to Mar&s;eilles by land; from whence he took pa&s;&s;age for Philadelphia, on board a brig belonging to that place. On the 15th Mr. Donald&s;on, (who was the American Amba&s;&s;ador at this time in the Mediterranean) informed me that he was going to Porto Ferrajo, and wi&s;hed to have me accompany him, as his chief bu&s;ine&s;s was, to endeavour to recover the &s;hip Fortune. I ac|cordingly waited till he was ready to go. On the 19th Mr. Donald&s;on told me he &s;hould be ready to go the next morning, and de&s;ired that I would take a boat, and five men, (which he had procured) and proceed to Piombino a &s;mall port in the dominions of the King of Na|ples, and there wait his arrival, as he intended to go to that place by land, in order to &s;ettle &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, at Pisa, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was once a flouri&s;hing city in Italy, but is now &s;o poorly inhabi|ted, that the gra&s;s grows in &s;everal of the &s;treets.

<PB N="155" REF="033747_0154_0FF91A3BC4CF2F98">
Piombino the &s;ame afternoon. Mr. Donald|&s;on arrived on the 22d, and we &s;ailed for Porto Ferrajo, early the next morning, where we arrived the &s;ame evening, the di&s;tance being but twelve leagues. On the 24th, we &s;ailed again for Leghorn; the next day, the wind being contrary, and blowing a very fre&s;h breeze we deemed it not &s;afe to continue at &s;ea in an open boat, and therefore run into St. Vincen|chi, a &s;mall town in Tu&s;cany. On the 26th, the wind being in our favour, we &s;ailed at 4 A. M. and arrived at Leghorn at 6 o'clock, in the afternoon. My whole time was now em|ployed, in &s;eeking for a pa&s;&s;age to my native country, and having nothing to depend on for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but the few cloaths, which the Engli&s;h had been plea&s;ed to let me keep, as they did not think them worth taking from me; the greate&s;t part of which I was obliged to &s;ell to purcha&s;e me &s;omething to eat. My ca&s;e was now become truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and how long it would remain &s;o, I knew not, for as the French had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, all bu|&s;ine&s;s was entirely &s;tagnated, except privateer|ing, and where to go, to better my&s;elf I was at a lo&s;s, as I was informed every day by the pack|ets which arrived, that no American ve&s;&s;els, were in any of the ports of Italy.</P>
<P>While waiting for a pa&s;&s;age I will endeavor to give the Reader a &s;hort de&s;cription of Leg|horn. This city is the ancient Portus Libur|nus, belonging to the Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany is not remarkably large, but is regularly built,
<PB N="156" REF="033747_0155_0FF91A4068A6E028">
and is in the modern ta&s;te. It is well fortified. It contains about 40,000 inhabitants 20,000 of whom are Jews. The mo&s;t of the trade pa&s;&s;es through their hands. It is a free port, which makes the trade here very con&s;iderable, con|&s;equently a great re&s;ort for Merchants of all nations. It has a &s;ecure harbor but is apt to be choaked up, &s;o that the Grand Duke's &s;laves are employed in clearing it. The Mar&s;hes about the place are filled with the &s;and which they take out of the harbor, by which means the city is render|ed more healthful than u&s;ual. Foreigners pay only a pia&s;tres, or &s;cuds, for a bale of goods of what bulk or quality &s;oever it be, yet the quantity of Merchandize imported is &s;o large, that this &s;mall duty is no &s;mall revenue to the Duke. But the inland duties are very high, nothing pa&s;&s;ing in or out of Leghorn by land, but the inhabitants pay large taxes. For the convenience of navigation, there is a light|hou&s;e lanthorn, with 30 lamps, erected on a rock without the harbor. And on the &s;hore a lazaretto, where &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, or goods, mu&s;t perform quarantine. Here all nations, and even the Mahometans, have free acce&s;s, and may &s;ettle. The Jews live in a particular part of the city, have a hand&s;ome &s;ynagogue, and though &s;ubject to very heavy impo&s;ts, are in a thriving condition.</P>
<P>I remained in this &s;ituation until the 1&s;t of April, when I had information of a Dani&s;h brig, (then laying in the harbour) being bound to America, I immediately went on board, and
<PB N="157" REF="033747_0156_0FF91A454CE94C40">
a&s;ked the Captain where he was bound, he told me to Bo&s;ton, I a&s;ked him if he would give me a pa&s;&s;age for my work, he &s;aid he had men enough, and could not give any one a pa&s;&s;age; but if I would pay him an hundred dollars he would carry me, to this propo&s;al I readily ob|jected, as I was not the owner of that number of pence; at la&s;t he told me if I would do a &s;ea|man's duty, on the pa&s;&s;age, and give him an obligation to pay him forty dollars on our ar|rival, he would take me on board. I told him I would give him an an&s;wer at twelve o'clock. I then went on &s;hore, and as I was walking up the mole, I met a gentleman who a&s;ked me what countryman I was? I told him I was an American. He then a&s;ked me &s;everal que&s;|tions, and enquired if I belonged to any ve&s;&s;el in the harbour, and after having received my an&s;wers, he told me he had chartered a Ra|gu&s;ean polacre, and intended to &s;end her to Philadelphia, and that if I would go in her, I &s;hould have a pa&s;&s;age, which I readily accep|ted, and returned him my &s;incere thanks;&mdash;he then told me I might embark the next day, which I accordingly did.</P>
<P>At twelve o'clock, I went according to my promi&s;e, on board the Dane, and informed him that I had got a pa&s;&s;age to America on board the polacre, at which he appeared to be much di&s;&s;atisfied, and offered me a pa&s;&s;age for my work, but I told him I had engaged to go in the other ve&s;&s;el, and intended to fulfill my
<PB N="158" REF="033747_0157_0FF8C5A627B519A0">
promi&s;e, we then parted, and I left him much di&s;plea&s;ed, at my not accepting his la&s;t offer. At the &s;ame time that he told me he had men enough, he wanted one man to make up his &s;hip's company, and was obliged to hire one next day; but knowing my &s;ituation, and thinking I &s;hould be glad to work and pay both, for my pa&s;&s;age, he endeavoured to take this advantage.</P>
<P>On the 2d of April I embarked in the quality of a pa&s;&s;enger, on board the <HI>Madona del ro&s;ario e&s;an vineenzo feraro</HI> of Ragu&s;a, which was the polacre before mentioned, bound to Phila|delphia. We &s;ailed on the 4th, and on the 11th, was taken by a Spani&s;h privateer and carried into Barcelona, was cleared on the 12th and &s;ailed again, and on the 20th was captured by a French privateer, and carried in|to Almeria, treated politely and cleared on the 22d, and &s;ailed. On the 29th, the wind hav|ing been contrary for &s;everal days, we run in|to Malaga, where we waited for a fair wind until the 21&s;t of May. We then &s;ailed, and on the 22d was boarded by his Britannic Ma|je&s;ty's &s;hip Petterel, treated very well and per|mitted to proceed on our voyage.</P>
<P>On the 23d, at 6, A. M. was boarded by two Spani&s;h privateers, (Gibraltar then bearing W. N. W. about three leagues di&s;tant) and carri|ed into Ceuta, a &s;mall port on the coa&s;t of Bar|bary, at pre&s;ent occupied by the Spaniards, and having &s;truck one of the privateer&s;men with a &s;word, and wounded him on the arm, was

put into a dungeon, ironed hands and feet, where I was kept about an hour and an half, and then let out. The ve&s;&s;el was cleared the &s;ame evening, and we &s;ailed for Philadelphia.</P>
<P>On the 28th, being in lat. 31. 54. N. and long. 17. 25. W. was boarded by a Spani&s;h privateer, of 14 guns, and robbed of a quanti|ty of provi&s;ions, and the greate&s;t part of our cloathes, and then permitted to proceed. On the 1&s;t of July was boarded by his Britanic Maje&s;ty's &s;hip Woolwich, mounting fifty guns. This &s;hip had taken twenty five &s;ail of Ameri|can ve&s;&s;els under her convoy, from the I&s;lands of Grenada, and Antigua, and had left them the day before &s;he fell in with us. After hav|ing examined our papers, they permitted us to proceed on our voyage. Being very &s;hort of provi&s;ions, we endeavoured to get &s;ome from on board the Woolwich, but could not be &s;upplied, &s;he being as &s;hort as our&s;elves.&mdash;On the 24th, latt. 38. 20. N. and long. 74. 10. W. &s;poke the brig Jeffer&s;on, from St. Croix bound to Philadelphia, from whom we got a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, having been about forty days upon le&s;s than one bi&s;cuit per day, with nothing el&s;e except oil, and wine.</P>
<P>On the 25th, at 4 A. M. &s;aw Cape May bear|ing W. b. N. about 6 leagues di&s;tant. At 11 took on board a pilot, and &s;tood in for the land, wind N. W. on the 28th arrived at Phi|ladelphia, where I had the happine&s;s of meet|ing &s;everal per&s;ons, who had been companions in my mi&s;ery at Algiers, I al&s;o met with Mo&s;es

Brown, whom I left at Leghorn. I remained here (being indi&s;po&s;ed) until the 11th of Au|gu&s;t.
