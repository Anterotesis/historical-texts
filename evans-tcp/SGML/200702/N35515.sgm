<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES OF Captain ROBERT BOYLE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born at a sea-port called Boston, in Lincolnshire. My father was captain and owner of a merchant ship that traded to the West-Indies, but was cast away (homeward bound) upon the rocks of Scilly, and but one man saved of his whole crew. My mother and I were at an aunt's in London when the unhappy news of my father's death arrived.</P>
<P>I was too young to feel my loss; but my mother's grief soon broke her heart, and left me a poor helpless orphan not ten years of age. It's true, I had a tender aunt that was in pretty good cir|cumstances, who took care of my education. I soon learnt to read, and write a good hand; I understood a little Latin, and was perfect master of the French tongue, which I had been learning from my infancy. My mother was born at Paris, where my fa|ther married her very young, and brought her to reside at Boston.</P>
<P>By that time I had reached fourteen years of age, my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> told me it was time for me to think of some trade, desiring me to
<PB N="6" REF="046409_0005_10215DCBEF3E8F08">
chuse what I liked best, and she would provide for me accord|ingly. Said she, if I might advise you, I would have you study the law, under the tuition of your uncle&mdash;but I told her I did not much care for any calling that must owe its prosperity to the misfortune of others: And at last I chose that of a watch-maker, as imagining myself to have a good mechanical head. Accord|ingly I went upon liking (as they call it), and my master and I agreeing very well, I was bound with the usual forms, and found civil usage from him, in respect of my birth and the misfortunes of our family.</P>
<P>My aunt paid forty guineas, (which was reckoned, at that time a great price; but he was one of the top of his business) and besides, to find me in cloaths and other necessaries, during seven years apprenticeship.</P>
<P>The first half-year we agreed very well; but within that time, my master had married a wife of a pretty good fortune, and a large share of ill nature. In a month's time she began to tyran|nize over my master as well as me, and soon proved, as the saying is, <HI>The grey mare to be the better horse.</HI> She brought it to that pass at last, that I was obliged to go on all her half-penny errands&punc; and carry her book to church of a Sunday after her. I bore this tolerably well, but not without complaining to my aunt, who ad|vised me to make myself as easy as I could, for she feared speak|ing would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no good.</P>
<P>I went on this way for a whole year, and then, to complete my misfortunes, my poor aunt died of a dropsy. This, indeed, was the greatest shock of all my life; for while she lived I felt no want of father or mother: She left me 800l&punc; and my uncle&mdash;to be my guardian. I shall forbear mentioning his name, not out of regard to him, but of his children, who have proved a sweet graft|ing from a sour stock, and as good as he was base.</P>
<P>My shrew of a mistress continued her ill-nature to me, and one accident made her prove outrageous.</P>
<P>My master had a vast trade, and vented a great many watches beyond sea. One day he had a large parcel of them to go on board a ship bound for Lisbon; the vessel lay at Deptford, and my master was pleased to take me along with him in the boat.</P>
<P>Before we were got to Limehouse, my master called to mind
<PB N="7" REF="046409_0006_10215DCD7AD2B740">
that he had forgot a silver watch that he had purposely made for the captain of the ship. He landed me at Ratcliff cross, and de|sired I would be expeditious in, (for the tide running downwards, I could get to the Exchange sooner on foot than by water against the stream) then to take boat at Billingsgate and follow him to the ship.</P>
<P>I ran almost all the way, and I believe got to the Exchange in half an hour. When I came home, I found no body in the shop but my fellow-prentice, who informed me my mistress was above. I went immediately up stairs for the watch, (for my master told me he had left it in his own room, seeing he had wore it several days to prove the going of it) bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> found the door shut. Standing a moment to consider, I heard a man's voice speaking to my mis|tress in a low key, and I soon understood by their dialogue that love was the subject they talked of. I listened some time, till I found they had left-off discoursing, and were entered upon action.</P>
<P>Now at the head of the stairs, the maid had left a step-ladder that she had used in the morning, in nailing up some vall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the windows in the dining-room, and there being a glass over the chamber door, I had a great mind to see who it was that was do|ing my master's business in his absence. Thereupon I fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the ladder very softly against the wainscot by the door, and up I got: but leaning towards the window in order to see into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oom, my weight made the ladder s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">p, and the top sliding against the door, burst it open, and in I fell into the room, ladder and all, with no little noise.</P>
<P>The loving couple were mightily surprised you may be sure, and were in such a fright that they had forgot what they were a doing. But I saw enough to convince me that my master was in a fair way to get to heaven purely upon my mistress' account.</P>
<P>After our surprise was over, and every thing put in order again between the gentleman and madam, I ventured to tell her my er|rand; she gave me the watch with a hearty good box on the ear, and told m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> she wondered how I had the assurance to come up without knocking; but, added she, I believe you rather came upon some knavish design, and had intended to rob your master, if I had not been in the room with my physician, that came in purposely to see how I did.</P>
<P>It was plain enough what physic she was taking, yet I made my
<PB N="8" REF="046409_0007_10215DCFD397A7D0">
excuse to her, that I went to remove the ladder, and it fell out of my hand against the door and burst it open; but I told her I was sorry I had disturbed her, made my honours and walked off, tak|ing no notice that I had seen any thing. I took water at Bil|lingsgate, and followed my master.</P>
<P>In the boat I began to ruminate with myself, whether I had best keep this accident a secret, or disclose it to my master. At last, with many pros and cons with myself, I resolved to acquaint him with it; partly to be revenged on my mistress for the blow she struck me, and on the other side, not to let my honest master be kept in ignorance of her usage of him.</P>
<P>When I came on board, the captain commanded me (with my master's leave) to sit down at table with them. We dined heart|ily, the wine and punch went merrily round, and my master, the captain, with two more that were passengers, began to be in high mirth; when word was brought that the captain's lady, (as the messenger called her) would be on board in an hour to take her leave of him. My master upon this message, began to be merry with the captain. I wonder, said he, that you seafaring men will venture upon wives. Why so? replied the captain. Why so? returned my master, because in my opinion it should put you in mind of Cuckolds' Point as you went by water; your absence give them such a convenience, that I believe few let slip the op|portunity. Why, answered the captain, may'nt your wife, even now, be doing you the fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">? has she not time enough, d'ye imagine? The thing's soon done; and if they have an inclina|tion, watching and restraint will do no good; many an Alderman has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ornuted while upon Change; and I knew a parson's wise that seldom we it to church, but took time by the for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lock, and while the husband (good man) was taking care of his flock, the good woman at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was at her occupation with her gallant, a rich young farmer. But the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">son o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> afternoon being taken suddenly ill with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, was conveyed home be|fore he had begun his work, and there soon found the occasion of his pain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for he had been breeding horns, as children breed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">th, a little u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kindly. But, however, the parson having wit|nesses <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> promotion in the herd of cuckolds, went to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w with the farmer, and recovered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> damages; and yet he has been heard often to say, that his wife's tenement was never the worse.</P>
<P>This story occasioned some others much to the same purpose;
<PB N="9" REF="046409_0008_10215DD180E10578">
at last my master and I (the tide being turned) took our leave of the company, and wished them a good voyage. Coming by Cuck|old's Point, my master cried, Robin, why don't you pull off your hat to the gentleman in the window yonder? I pulled off my hat very orderly, but saw nobody; at which my master fell into a great fit of laughter, and cried, I have been very courteous to the horns. I then, understanding his meaning, told him, that it was only for married men to shew their complaisance that way; and, being a little piqued at the affront I thought put upon me, said, I believe most married men were, or would be in the lift of cuck|kolds. Why, how now, firrah! replied my master, d'ye think I am, or shall be a cuckold? Why truly, said I, Sir, I have but little reason to believe my mistress a saint more than any other wo|man; and to inform you farther of what I have seen to day, I beg you would be pleased to go to some public house, that we may not be observed by the water-men. My master's colour began to change upon this; and, being very impatient to be informed of what I knew, ordered the water-men to land at Ratcliff-cross, and wait a while.</P>
<P>We went to the Ship-Tavern and had a private room, where I declared to him the whole truth. After many questions and ans|wers between us, I soon found he believed all that I told him, for he turned as pale as ashes, and the tears stood in his eyes. I then was sorry I had disclosed it to him, remembering the inimitable Shakespeare,
<Q><L><HI>He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stole,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>After some time being silent, my master broke into many extra|vagant words, and threatening actions; and at last, I ventured to tell him, I thought him in the wrong to grieve at what could not be called back, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wondered the world should unjustly cast up|on the man, the ignomy which was due to the woman for her li|centiousness.</P>
<P>After some time he began to be more calm, and made me this compliment; Robin, said he, I have observed in thee a more than common understanding: Pray do tell me in what manner I shall behave myself in this affair. I thank you, Sir, said I, for your good opinion of me, and, were it my own case, I would not take any notice of it till I found her in the fact, or such circumstances that even she herself could not deny; and for these two reasons&punc;
<PB N="10" REF="046409_0009_10215DD41DDCCA68">
First, Whenever it comes to an open rupture, you'll have but an uneasy living: Secondly, That she may take it into her head to deny it, and then the whole weight of her anger will fall upon me; and truly, said I, I have too much of her ill-nature already to bear any more with any manner of patience.</P>
<P>My master could not imagine who this gallant should be by de|scription, for I had never seen him before. We went to our boat and so home. When we came in, my mistress asked my master if Robin (meaning me,) had been telling him any stories. Sto|ries, child! answered my master, what stories? he has told me nothing. Nay, no great matter, said my mistress, but I gave him a box on the ear this morning, when he came back for the watch you had forgot, and I did not know but he had made some com|plaint; but I am sorry for it, and will make him amends one time or other. This she said so loud that I might hear.</P>
<P>The next day, when my master was gone to 'Change, she came up into the workhouse, as we called it, up three pair of stairs, and and took an occasion of sending my fellow-prentice on some con|certed errand. When he was gone out, she sat down upon his chair, and looked me in the face for some time. Well, Robin, said she, I am very much obliged to you, that you did not take any notice of the accident that happened yesterday to your master, and to make you amends for your silence, I give you this broad piece to buy you a pair of gloves, with this promise, that you and I will never disagree again. I received her money, and told her I should never take any farther notice of it. She called me good lad, and left me.</P>
<P>My master had not always an opportunity of talking with me at home, so he appointed me every Sunday after sermon in the even|ing at some tavern or other, that we might talk about the matter. At our first meeting. I told him the story of the broad piece, and the discourse my mistress and I had together. I shewed him the money, and he soon knew it to be his wife's, from the particular fairness of it, being the same he had some time ago given her for a pocket-piece.</P>
<P>Now, said he, Robin, I am fully convinced of the infidelity of my wife; for notwithstanding your former story, I had some faint hopes it might have been a tale of thine, raised out of malice to thy mistress, from her indifferent usage of thee. But now, to and out this spark, that I may wreak my vengeance on him first;
<PB N="11" REF="046409_0010_10215DD81A679908">
for, to my own folly, Robin, I must tell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I can't find I shall ever be able to hate this ungrateful woman.</P>
<P>Some time after, my master was pretty well convinced that his wife had been with her spark to the Mulberry Garden, and my master had discovered who he was; he proved to be a young at|torney of Clifford's Inn. The next thing we consulted about at our weekly meeting was how to give them an opportunity of pur|suing their amour at home. In order to this, my master gave out to my mistress, that he should be obliged to go as far as St. Mar|garet's in Kent, to look after some goods that were landed there, in order to avoid paying custom for them, and he feared the affair would not be so well managed if he was not present.</P>
<P>The Tuesday following was chose for the day of his setting out. My master gave me public orders to go to several places in his ab|sence, to look after the workmen, (for there are several trades be|longing to the making of a watch.) On Tuesday morning my master got on horseback, in order (as my mistress, and the rest of the family thought) to pursue his journey; but he went no farther th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n Islington, and returned, putting up his horse again; and went up straight to the place of our rendezvous.</P>
<P>As soon as my master was gone, my mistress called me up to her, and asked me if I had time to step a little way for her. I told her 'twas impossible, seeing I had s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e work to finish, that I was obliged to carry out immediately. Then she begged, I would call her a po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">, which I did, and one of my particular acquain|tance, one well to pass in the world; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> porter in those days was a beneficial employment, there being then no penny post-office. I told him what he should do, that he must go to my mis|tress and receive the letter, and then to an adjacent ale house, and wait till I came to him. Accordingly, he received the letter, and went to the place I appointed. I did not let him wait long, but ordered my matters, as if I was going about my master's business, and went to the porter. From thence I took him along with me to my master, where we opened the letter, and found it as fol|lows;&mdash;"Dear Tom, it's an age since last I saw you; the cuck|old's gone out of town for a week, therefore meet me at the old place by six this evening." Here we were at a stand, for we could not imagine where the old place was, unless the Mulberry Gar|den. At last, we resolved to send the porter to the spark, and bring the answer to us, to see if that would give us more light in the affair. Accordingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> and returned with his billet.
<PB N="12" REF="046409_0011_10215DD9A6C110F8">
We made bold to open it, and found it contained these words:&mdash;"My life, I don't think the old place convenient, seeing a brother lawyer has discovered something of our intrigue: therefore, I'll wait on you before the time, that we may concert measures accord|ingly. I am glad your beast is out of town: we'll add another antler to adorn his brow, as soon as I have the happiness to see her who shall eternally command yours."&mdash;</P>
<P>When my master perceived that the scene was to be opened at his own house, he began to demur: But, after keeping silence a little time, he spoke to me to this purpose; Robin, this letter has in some sort confounded our design, for what I intended to act, I would not, if it could be avoided, put in execution at home, for fear it should make too much noise: for, added he, smiling, though a man has the misfortune to be a cuckold, yet he would not have all the world know it. I told him, I was glad to see him so merry upon the occasion, but begged he would not keep the porter any longer, for fear of some accident. He thanked me for my care, sealed up the letter again, and sent him away with it. When the porter was gone, my master ordered me to go home again, and observed how matters went there, and as soon as ever the spark came, to send the porter back to him with this no|tice, "That the work was ready to carry home, whenever I thought fit."</P>
<P>I had not been at home a quarter of an hour ere my gentleman came in a coach; he went up stairs, but did not stay a moment, came down again, whispered the coachman, and drove into Cheapsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e. I was at a loss how to behave myself, but my mistress or|dered another coach to be called. When I found out that, I sent for the porter, and told him secretly, that he must dog that coach, let it go where it would, and be expeditious in bringing me word. My mistress came down in her hood, and mask in her hand, and went off in the coach. I looked after her, as far as I could see her, and observed the porter to jump up behind the coach. I im|mediately went to my master, and acquainted him of the business. He hurried me home again, for fear the porter should wait for me, and ordered me to bring him, when he came, to the Pope's-Head tavern, because he would be nearer home.</P>
<P>The porter did not return in two hours: he told me that the coach drove to York-stairs, in York buildings, and there they got out and took a pair of ours; he went in another, and followed them till they landed at Lambeth, and dogg'd them into the
<PB N="13" REF="046409_0012_10215DDB6A595AB8">
White-lion inn. There he staid some time, to see if they intend|ed to go from thence; he walked into the kitchen and drank a mug of ale, and in a little time one of the waiters came in, and told the cook, the gentleman and his wife had bespoke a roasted fowl, and some fish for their dinner, and had ordered clean sheets to be put to air, for as soon as they had dined they designed to go to bed, seeing the stage-coach was to call them up at one the next morning.</P>
<P>I did not think it altogether so proper to take the porter to the Pope's-Head to my master, but went alone, where I found him with another gentleman, a stranger to me. When I had given him an account, we took coach all together and drove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Horse-ferry, Westminster, took boat and landed at Lambeth. We all went into the White-lion the back way, and I went to the drawer, (as we had before concerted) and asked if there was not a gentleman and a lady that designed to lie there all night for a stage coach in the morning; he answered in the affirmative, but added&punc; they were that moment gone to bed, that they might be the better able to rise in the morning. I asked him which room they lay in, for that I had business of great consequence to communicate to him. Why, that room up one pair of stairs, answered the draw|er, and pointed at the door. Well, said I, fetch me a pint of wine, I'll drink a glass, and then go and wait on them.</P>
<P>The drawer ran down for the wine, and in the mean-time, I beckoned to my master: up stairs he went, I sat my foot against the door, burst it open, and there we soon perceived the loving couple playing at Rantum Scantum. I shut too the door again, and stood guard, that no one should enter. My master laid first hold of my naked gentleman, and, with the assistance of his friend, threw him upon his back, clapt a pistol to his breast, and swore he would shoot him, if he offered to stir or cry out. Then my master's friend took out a box of instruments, and, with a pair of scissars for that purpose, soon deprived him of what Se|nesino and several Italian singers want as well as our spark. The thing was done so suddenly, that I believe my gentleman hardly knew his loss till he felt the blood trickle down about his legs. He made several attempts to get up, but to no purpose. My master told him he had better be quiet, for fear he should be worse served, (but in my opinion that could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">dly be.) The surgeon (for it proved my master's friend was no other) had all his implements about him; he managed his needle, his plaisters,
<PB N="14" REF="046409_0013_10215DDF173CE5F8">
and salves, and finished my gentleman, and would have had him gone home something lighter than he came, but he proved so weak with loss of blood and the pain together, that he fainted away.</P>
<P>My mistress had hid herself behind the curtain, and did not so much as say one word; but in all her concern, she took care to dress herself; and when she had done, she sat upon the bed|side next the wall, and seemed to be in deep discontent.</P>
<P>We had got my gentleman to himself again by the help of the drawer, who soon found how matters went. When we had done, my master said to his wife, Madam, I must confess, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o blame to disturb you in your diversion, but I own my fault, and will endeavour to mend it, by leaving you together to solace yourselves, and so I take my leave.</P>
<P>Upon this, we marched down stairs, paid for our wine, and went to our boat that waited for us, and landed at the Steel-yard. My master was very uneasy all the way home, and we could not get one word out of him. He went up stairs, looked himself in his room, and remained alone several hours. I would have been willing to have diverted his melancholy, but did not well know how I should go about it.</P>
<P>Near seven o'clock in the evening, he called me up stairs, and asked me if I had heard any thing of his wife. I told him, No. Nay, said he, if she has any shame left, she will hardly attempt to come again in haste. After some time, he went out, and did not come home again till twelve o'clock. He asked me still af|ter my mistress, and understanding we had no news of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er, went to bed.</P>
<P>The next morning he ordered me to send the porter to Lam|beth, to learn how they behaved themselves when we had less them. He returned and told my master, that the gentlewoman went away as soon as she found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were gone, and left the gen|tleman there, who was so weak, that he remained there still, and had sent for several of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>In the afternoon my mistress' mother came to my master, and they had a long discourse, and afterwards went out together. But I was never more surprised in my life&punc; when he came home the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame evening with his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e and mother.

<PB N="15" REF="046409_0014_10215DE2337CC170">
me the next day that his wife resolved never to be guilty of any fault again, and by her submission, and the intreaties of her mo|ther, he had resolved to take her home once more. Sir, said I, if you can forgive her, no one else has any thing to do with it. But, added I, I fear I shall feel the effects of her displeasure. No, answered my master, that was one of my conditions with your mistress, that she should take no notice of past transactions. And truly she kept her word, for she would not so much as look at me.</P>
<P>She continued very reserved for a great while, and never went out but to church of a Sunday.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the same year, my master began to be out of order, and the physician advised him to go into the country for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; accordingly he took lodgings at Hampstead, when my mistress used to go twice or thrice every week to see him; and my master told me when I went of a Sunday to wait upon him, to give him an account of the business of the shop, that his wife had been so tender of him in his illness, that he verily believed he should never have occasion to blame her conduct again. I told him, I was as well pleased as he was.</P>
<P>About a week afterwards, my mistress went in and out very often, and seemed to be very busy, giving orders to my fellow-prentice for taking her a place in the Hampstead coach as usual. This happened on the Tuesday, and I saw her no more that week.</P>
<P>When I went to my master on the Sunday following, he asked me if my mistress was out of order, seeing he had not seen her since the Monday l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">st. Nor I since Tuesday, said I, but I thought she had been with you, for the took a place in the coach in order to come to you that day, and sent out several bundles to be carried, as she usually did when she was going to wait on you.</P>
<P>My master was so confounded with what I told him, that he did not offer to speak for some time, and the sweat ran down his face like drops of rain. At last, said he, Robin, I fear all is not well! My wife has certainly undone me. Come, hope for the best, said I.</P>
<P>Well, my master resolved, weak as he was, to go for London immediately. We took a coach, and soon got home; and there
<PB N="16" REF="046409_0015_10215DE3EABE0440">
to my great sorrow, found my mistress had robbed my master to the value of five thousand pounds in bank-notes and money, with six and thirty gold watches and seventeen silver ones, besides her own wearing cloaths. My master at this loss, sunk down upon his bed. I went and fetched some of his neighbours and friends to comfort him, while I ran up and down like a madman, to see if I could get any tidings of the thief.</P>
<P>I went to give orders at the bank to stop payment, but to my great sorrow found the money had been received four days be|fore. I came back to acquaint my master with my ill success, and found him alone and gone to bed. When I told him I could not hear any tidings of my mistress, and that the money had been received, he cried Robin, it is not the money that grieves me, but the ill usage of my wife; 'tis that has got to my heart, and never to be removed till death. I sat up with him a great while, till he told me he began to be sleepy, and ordered me to retire; but as I was going from him, he took me by the hand and bid me good night. I found by his pulse, that he was in a strong fever, and begged I might call a physician; but he said, he should be better in the morning, if not, he would send for one. Finding him willing to rest, I left him and went to bed.</P>
<P>As soon as I waked in the morning, I put on my gown, and went to see how he did; but found him so weak and faint, that he had not strength enough to lift up his head. I was immedi|ately running to fetch a physician that lived hard by our house, but my master called me back, and told me that it was too late, for, said he, I feel my last moment approaching. He ordered me to sit upon the bed by him, he took my hand in his, which burnt like f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re, and said, Robin, my wife has killed me: I could have borne any other misfortune with temper: if thou ever shouldst see her, tell her from me, that I forgive her, and that I beg she would reform her life; but also, let her know that she was the death of me. I told him, I would not have him talk of dying for an un|grateful woman that did not deserve the least regard, but to cheer up his spirits, and let me go for a physician. No, said he, all physic or counsel comes too late;
<Q><L><HI>I've that within which baffles all their art,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sure means to make the soul and body part,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A burning fever, and a broken heart.</HI></L></Q>

He had no sooner repeated those lines, but his speech failed him, his eyes closed, and he expired only with a sigh.</P>
<P>I must confess I was inwardly shocked, and the spirit of revenge rose in my soul against the barbarous cause of his end.</P>
<P>When I had a little recollected my scattered thoughts, I went to a cousin of my master's, that lived in Cheapside, and desired he would come and take care of his affairs. For my own part, I could not compose myself for&punc; two or three days: At last, I went to my uncle, and desired he would let me have twenty pounds to buy me mourning, (for I did intend to wear black; that my melan|choly outside might conform with what I felt within,) out of re|spect to my master's memory. Mourning, Bob? answered my uncle, why, if thy master's friends won't give it thee, 'tis my opin|ion, thou oughtest not to think on't. Yes, Sir, added I, I think it my duty, for though my mistress used me ill, my master always was civil to me. But my uncle told me, in plain terms, that I should not have a farthing. I told him, I wanted but my own; but he replied, when he thought I was of years enough, to manage my money myself, perhaps, I might be trusted with at, but at pre|sent he would take care of it for me.</P>
<P>I was very uneasy at this affair, for it began to look, as if he in|tended to cheat me of it, and I did not stick to tell him my senti|ments in a civil manner, but to no purpose. I left him with a very heavy heart, and came home. I went to bed in the utmost confusion of thought; yet, notwithstanding my discontent, slept till morning. I got up about six o'clock; with a scurvy idea of my future fortune. About eight, my uncle's man brought me a letter from him, in which he begged my pardon, and told me, it was only to try my temper. The man gave me ten guineas by his order, and further told me, that his taylor would be with me im|mediately to take my directions; and accordingly, before the fel|low was gone, he came, took measure of me, and told me, he would be sure to bring my cloaths home by twelve o'clock the next day; and he kept his word with me.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I had provided myself with every thing else with the money my uncle had sent me; and the same evening waited on him to return him thanks. Bob, said he, I had only a mind to try your temper, and I find, thou art thy father's own child, a chip of the old blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k.</P>

He would have me stay to sup with him; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, among other discourse, he asked me, what I did intend to do, now my master was dead, for he did not suppose I was master of my trade enough to follow it. I replied, I knew enough to recommend myself to any other master without paying any more money. My uncle re|plied, I needed not be in such haste, but take some time to con|sider of it, and, in the mean while, I should live with him, and be heartily welcome. And to make his actions agree with his words, he gave me five guine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> more for pocket-money, and gave direc|tions for me to be with one of his clerks, a good-natured young fellow, that was a school-fellow of mine.</P>
<P>I was very glad of the occasion, living with my uncle in great tranquillity the space of a month, and all the time he seemed to be very fond of me, never denying me any thing that I asked him.</P>
<P>One Sunday morning, before church-time, he called me to him, and (after many professions of friendship) asked me, if ever I had done any business for my master out of the watch-making trade. I pretty well guessed at what he meant, and answered him in the affirmative. Very well, said he, I must send you as far as Graves|end to-morrow about the same affair; and if I executed my com|mission dextrously, he told me, it should be the better for me.</P>
<P>The next morning, I got up, and my uncle sent me with a let|ter into Pall-Mall to a client of his, and returning with an answer, found him taking his leave of a gentleman that looked like a sea-officer. As soon as their compliments were over, my uncle dis|patched me away to Billingsgate, and gave me instructions what to do. I was to enquire for a ship called the Success, Captain Stokes commander, at Gravesend, and then to follow his directions.</P>
<P>As I was talking with my uncle, my bed-fellow thrust a book into my pocket, and told me, that would divert me in the boat, if I had not company that I liked. I did nor much regard what he said, but went about my business, got into the Gravesend boat, which put off upon the instant, and had the fortune to light of good company, and one young man, that was going to the same ship as I was.</P>
<P>We were very merry all the way with little stories we told among ourselves. We got on board the Success about two o'clock in the afternoon, and the first person I saw, was the same man that
<PB N="19" REF="046409_0018_10215DEC72878818">
I found with my uncle in the morning. He took me by the hand and carried me into the cabin, and set a piece of ship-beef before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. When I had dined, he informed me my things would be on bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d immediately. I told him it was very well, not suspect|ing any thing. Afterwards the captain went out and left me alone in the cabin: I got up, and looking out of the cabin window, found the ship was under sail. At first I began to be surprised, but yet was so ignorant that I thought we were sailing up the riv|er. While I was ruminating on the matter the captain came and told me, my things were ready for me whenever I would. I went out; but how was I surprised, when I saw my trunk that I left at my uncle's, with all my cloaths in it! I was in such confu|sion, that I had not power to utter one word for some time. At last, recovering out of my surprise, I asked him the meaning of what I saw! Meaning, child! replied the captain; why, what's the matter? would you go such a voyage as we are upon, without necessaries? What voyage? returned I. Why, to Virginia, re|plied the captain. At that answer, I sat me down upon my chest and burst into tears, and had such a combat in my mind that be|reaved me of the power of thinking for some time. The captain indeed did all he could to comfort me: At last, I fancied it might only be a jest; but to my sorrow, found, by all their discourse, it was but too much in earnest.</P>
<P>The captain declared that my uncle had bargained with him for my passage, and that I was to be delivered to a relation I had in Charlestown, upon the continent of America, I asked the name, but he told me one th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> I had never heard of before.</P>
<P>When I found I was certainly betrayed by my barbarous uncle, I fell upon my knees, and begged the captain to put me on shore, and I would find some means to pay the sum he was to have for my passage. He answered, he was too well paid already, to let me go on shore again: and further added, I had nothing to do but to make myself easy, for I was not likely to set my foot in Europe, till I had first seen America.</P>
<P>I found it was to no purpose to intreat any farther; It is true, I had no aversion to the sea, but rather an inclination; and if my uncle had made any proposals to me concerning such a voyage, and properly prepared, 'tis ten to one if I had not accepted it. But in this manner to be kidnapped, (for it was no better,) and then the dread of being parted with as a slave when I came t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ith|er,
<PB N="20" REF="046409_0019_10215DEE01E3FA70">
shocked me prodigiously. But being naturally of an easy tem|per, eight or ten days pretty well wore off my apprehensions, and I began to be contented with my wretched fate. I set myself with all my diligence to learn the mathematics, as also the work of a sailor, and quickly attained to some knowledge. I soon ingra|tiated myself with most of the crew, who instructed me in all they knew.</P>
<P>I mentioned a book my uncle's clerk put in my pocket as I left the chambers the morning I was trepanned, which, for the first three or four days I did not remember: but putting my hand in my pocket to feel for something else, I took it out, and found in it a letter directed for me, which was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR BOB,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>WHEN you went to St. James's this morning,</HI> (supposing&punc; I would have read it the day I received it) <HI>I overheard my master discoursing with the captain of a ship, and learnt he intends to send you to Virginia. I could not understand the particulars, but enough to know the bargain is made. My friendship to you, and the barbarity of your uncle, obliges me to give you this (I hope) timely notice. I shall leave the manage|ment to you: but whatever steps you take, I am not to be in the question; and I thought of this way to acquaint you with it, fearing I should not have the opportunity of speaking to you. Farewell, till I see you again, which I hope in God will not be long.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>A. M.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This letter made me curse my fate again; for if I had had the good fortune to have read it before I was on ship-board, I might have prevented my uncle's design: But it was my destiny, and therefore I submitted to it.</P>
<P>We met with nothing in our voyage till we came near the Ca|naries: When one evening we heard several cannons fired, as we supposed two leagues from us. Our captain alter'd his course, in order to avoid a re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">counter with an enemy; for our ship carried but ten guns and twenty men, besides passengers. But notwith|standing the captain's care, as soon as ever the morning dawned, and the fog was cleared up, we found ourselves within half a mile of a rover of Barbary. We were all mightily surprised, for the galley made up to us with sails and oars, being to windward of us. Our captain advised us to surrender immediately, but the sailors
<PB N="21" REF="046409_0020_10215DEFB73E0378">
were for fighting, and were confirmed in their opinion upon sight of another vessel bearing down upon us, whom they knew to be Spanish by their colours. All our guns were immediately brought to the starboard side, and every body ready to engage, passengers and all who were willing to preserve their liberty.</P>
<P>The rover by this time was just on our starboard bow, and pre|pared to board us. We had some hand-grenadoes on board, with several other stores for our fort at Charlestown, and a gunner as one of our passengers. He ordered several men into our main|top with grenadoes, and followed himself; as soon as ever the gal|ley came near enough, our men at the helm bore away, and fired our guns upon him, which raked them fore and aft, and did much execution. Our gunner above in the top threw in upon them with his grenadoes, which we could perceive put them into much con|fusion. But all this would not have availed, if they had not per|ceived the Spanish man of war bearing upon us. They did not make any farther attempts to board us, but they fired their cannon, and galled us with their small arms.</P>
<P>I had gotten a musket on board, and discharged it as I thought, for it flashed in the pan, and the noise of the other pieces deceived me. I charged again, but then found by the rammer, that my piece had not gone off; However, I was resolved to fire it: I stood upon the larboard gunnel, just upon the forecastle, to be as far from the enemy as I could, and fired my piece; but be|ing double charged, and a stubborn jade, gave me such a bang that threw me over the side of our ship; my foot hung in the fore|chains for some time, but struggling (with my head downwards) to raise myself up, my foot disentangled, and I fell plump into the sea.</P>
<P>Although I had learnt to swim in England, yet the fright, the smoke, and altogether, took away my understanding and I found by my struggling, that I had got within ten yards of the rover, and she that instant, bearing away before the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d&punc; they did me the fa|vour to stun me with a stroke of one of their oars, and took me on board with them.</P>
<P>They rowed with all their strength, and the wind being in their stern, they insensibly left the Success, who flatted their fails, and laid by till the Spanish ship came up with her, and then we could perceive them both making after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>

The captain of the corsair was an Irish renegado, and as soon as he was out of danger, he sent for me into the cabin, and asked me several questions concerning our ship, where she was bound, and who I was (for he took me for more than a common sailor, seeing I was not in a sailor's habit.) I told him my story as I have rela|ted in the foregoing sheets. He shook his head, and, with a smile, said I was very ready at a lie. Sir, said I, I am so far from lying, that I jumped over-board on purpose to come to your ves|sel rather than to stay with them, chusing to be a slave nearer home, than to go I don't know where with the knave that trepan|ned me: And to convince your honour of the truth (I honoured him much) here's the letter which my uncle's clerk slipped into my pocket in a book (for by good fortune I had the letter and book in my pocket when I fell over-board.) At reading the letter he was convinced, he said, of my sincerity: and thou shalt see, added he, notwithstanding the bad opinion is held of us renega|does, that you shall fare the better for your confidence in us. Sir, returned I, this accident may convince you that I thought very well of your honour, for as soon as I saw your honour upon deck giving cammand, I thought you had the look of a gentleman; (though by the bye he had a damn'd Tyburn face.)</P>
<P>I clarkt him so well (with your honour) that he began to fancy himself a hero indeed. He ordered my chains to be taken off, (for they had done me the favour to provide me some as soon as ever they had got me on board) and told me that if I would turn. Mahometan I should have command under him. I answered him, I hoped he would give me some time to consider of it. Ay, ay, time, thou shalt have half-a-year's time to consider of it, returned the captain. He carried me out upon deck, and told my story to his crew, who were mightily pleased with the relation, and saluted me after the Moorish manner, by bowing their heads, and clap|ping their hands across upon their breasts.</P>
<P>There were several other English renegadoes that were officers in the galley, but most of the common sailors were natural Moors. The captain told me that he did design to make for Sallee with all the expedition he could, for he engaged with a Spanish man of war the night before, and had suffered very much in both his ves|sel and crew: but he told me he would soon be out again, for he had another vessel ready in Sallee-road to put out to sea. We had before night lost sight of the Success, and Spanish man of war
<PB N="23" REF="046409_0022_10215DF61ABE40A0">
that had so luckily freed her from the infidel's clutches; and we steered for Sallee.</P>
<P>Ten days after, we discovered the African shore, within five leagues west of Sallee-road: and the wind favouring us, we anch|ored in the harbour by six in the evening. The captain went on shore, but ordered me to remain on board till the next day.</P>
<P>I must confess I began to have some hopes of seeing my own country again, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t yet did not know how to bring it about; how|ever, I resolved to trust providence.</P>
<P>The next morning my master sent for me on shore, by a young renegado sailor born at London, whose Christian name (I learnt) was Francis Corbert, but had exchanged it for Mustapha; a good intelligent young fellow, and one that was perfect master of the mathematics. The reason why he did not accompany the captain in this voyage, was a violent fever when he set sail. I asked him why he could forget the Saviour of the world to turn Mahometan? he told me, that he was only one from the teeth outward, and he thought it better to trust God with his soul, than than those barba|rous wretches with his body. I thought it was a pretty free dec|laration to one that was an utter stranger to him.</P>
<P>As soon as we were landed, I had the whole town of Sallee staring at me; for the captain of the rover had taken care to spread my story among them, and I had as much respect shown by the people of the town as he had. He took me home to his own house, and used me with much civility for a week or ten days; during that time, he had carried me twice or thrice to his country-house, about six miles up the river. It was a very plea|sant place, situated in a little wood, with a river running round it, and no approaching to it but over a draw-bridge. At this house his wives lived, for I was informed he had several.</P>
<P>Observing his garden, I told him it was but indifferently kept. He answered, it was for want of a gardener, none of his slaves un|derstanding that art. I offered my service, but told him I did not pretend to be a gardener, but I was assured I could soon make amendment to it, with the help of some of his servants. He or|dered me to take as many as I thought fit, and, added he, because I am impatient to see it in a better condition, I'll leave you here, I told him I begged to be excused now, because I should want
<PB N="24" REF="046409_0023_10215DF7CDA220A8">
several things for my designs. If it be tools, said he, or seeds of all sorts, I have them here. Upon which he carried me into a little house, meant for a green-house, where I found every thing that was wanting, with a large quantity of European seeds and roots. I told him I was satisfied, there was every thing that I should want. The captain ordered me a bed to be made in the green-house, and an old eunuch, that understood French very well, to wait on me, with a strict order that I should have every thing I asked for, but I was not to approach the house in his ab|sence upon any account. I told him I had no curiosity that way, and did not doubt but I would show him something that would please him the next time he came, which was to be in twenty days.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, I went to work, (for gardening was what I always took delight in, both theory and practice.)</P>
<P>I drew out plans, ordered my workmen, and in six days time brought it into some form. I perceived in the middle of the gar|den a puddle of water, which I gave directions to be drained, and found that it had been formerly a fountain, but was only choked up with filth by neglect. I asked the old eunuch if he had ever known it to play, and he answered in the negative, neither did they imagine it to be any such t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ng: for his master had bought the estate of an old Spanish renegado four years before, and he told him it had been a fish-pond. I examined about the river, and found the head of the pipes stopped with rubbish, which I cleared, and by degrees the water worked through into the foun|tain, and out again through another conveyance. I observed that there had been figu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> upon it, by the pipes: I asked my eunuch if he had ever seen any such things? he told me there were seve|ral lying in a back-yard on the other side of the house. I went with him, and found four small figures of Tritons, and a Neptune in his chariot drawn by sea-horses. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">dered them to be brought to the fountain, and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t them on, (fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t slopping the water, and then letting it loose again) and finished my fountain, which played admirably out of the shells of the Tritons, (which they seemed to blow with) from the nostrils of the horses and the trident of the Neptune. The workmen were astonished to see with what expe|dition I had completed it, and imagined I had dealt with the devil.</P>
<P>The next morning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> came to me before I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> up, and desired I'd give him the key of my chamber, and be contented to be a prisoner till he came to me again. I was a little surprised,
<PB N="25" REF="046409_0024_10215DFA471C3890">
and asked him the reason: He told me he could not give me any, that being beyond his commission. Accordingly he locked me in and went away. I began to ruminate about this accident, but could not imagine the cause: I had no way to look towards the garden, because the windows of the green-house looked over the river into the wood, and the back, which fronted the house, had only painted windows for ornament, not use. In about two hours my e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nuch came and released me, and we din'd together. I used all the rhetoric I was master of to find out the secret, but to no purpose: he only added, that I must be in the same condition again the next morning. This was still more surprising, and I began to think by degrees I should entirely lose my liberty. The old eunuch imagining my thoughts, assured me there was no harm meant to me. This afternoon was my last day's work, and in three days more I expected the captain. About an hour before night, I perceived another eunuch of the house talking earnestly with him that used to attend me, who immediately came to me, and told me he must beg me to retire to my chamber that instant; upon which I readily obeyed, knowing it was to no purpose to contend.</P>
<P>I was upon the tent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs to know the reason of my confinement; whilst I was employing my thoughts about it, I heard the voices of women. It surprised me at first, but I soon found that was the reason of my being made a prisoner. When the eunuch came to bring me my supper, I told him he need not have made such a secret of what I was locked up for, for I had found it out; and then told him that I had heard women's voices in the garden. Did you? (said he, surprised,) I'll take care they shall keep their tongues within their teeth for the future. He said no more, but immediately went out, and soon returned, and told me I should hear no more of them. I was confounded with this odd proceed|ing, and my curiosity began to be more and more raised.</P>
<P>When I was left alone, I began to examine my room where I was, to see if I could find ever a peep-hole, and by good fortune found one made by time and ill weather under the pent-house. I, upon the instant of my dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ering, made all the use I could of it, and soon perceived three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">men in the wall with their backs towards me. They were in a Turkish undress, with their necks hare: one of them above the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">est secured to me to have a better shape and air than commonly the women of Morocco have. I don't know what came over me, but I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ently to expect their nearer ap|proach.
<PB N="26" REF="046409_0025_10215DFD8B712360">
At last my desires were answered; for as soon as they had spent some time at my new fountain, they directed their steps towards my confinement, and when they were near enough, I could distinguish them to be three handsome women: but one of them that seemed to be very melancholy, surpassed the other two, at least in my opinion. She seemed to be about twenty, fair to a miracle, and much like an English woman. She did not seem to converse with the other two, but followed them with an air of con|templation; and I could observe her sigh often. I never till this mo|ment had the least regard to any of the female sex, no more than good manners and decency required; but I sound myself in a mo|ment full of aching tenderness for this strange woman. Though I had no time for thought till the ladies were retired, I then began to reason with myself, and found love, like destiny, was not to be avoided; and the more I thought, the more I was plunged in this tormenting, yet pleasing passion. Yet I thought it was very odd to fall in love, considering my circumstances. I had nothing to hope, and all to fear: I was poor, a prisoner, and a stranger; far from my native country, in want of necessaries, and to complete my misery, sunk in one hour an age in love. Every new thought seemed a thorn to torment me: yet notwithstanding all these dif|ficulties, a beam of hope would now and then shine through the thick clouds of despair, and encourage me to love on. From this though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I began to think with reason (if a lover can be called a reasonable creature) how I should manage my passion. I began to reflect the Moors were jealous of their women even to a degree, and did not in the least doubt but my Irish renegado had learnt that part of their manners. At last I pitched upon an odd expedient: I determined to shew to my captain an utter detestation of all fe|males (and in truth the usage my poor master met with from his wife very much lessened the regard I owed the sex) and try what that would do. This thought seemed to give me some satisfaction, and as soon as the eunuch came to release me, I begged he would sup with me that evening. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> accordingly promised me, and came immediately with my supper, and brought under his gar|ment a bottle o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> excellent Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> wire.

privately, great quantities for his own use. I told him, thought Mahomet ordered his followers to abstain from wine, be|cause an immoderate use of it generally turned to immoderate pas|sions; but to take it sparingly, gives health and vigor to the body, and chearfulness to the spirits. He agreed with me in my senti|ments, and shewed he approved of them by drinking to me.&mdash;Notwithstanding my endeavours to hide the trouble of my spirits, my kind eunuch took notice of a concern in my countenance, and cheered me up with repeated glasses; and imagining my confine|ment caused <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat alteration, told me he would not have me take to heart the small abridgement of my liberty, for as soon as his master arrived, I should not be restrained any more, for the case would cease, by the confinement of the ladies to their several apartments. I told him with a seeming joy, that I should be mightily pleased, when that should happen, for I abhorred the fight of them; wo|men were my utter aversion, and had been from my infancy; and that aversion was aggravated by the knowledge of their perfi|dy; and I thought it the greatest curse could fall upon that noble creature man not to be born without them. Upon this I told him the story of my master and mistress, and several extravagant tales of my own invention, and painted that beautiful part of the crea|tion in the colour of the devil. My companion praised me for slighting the sex, and backed my stories with as many of his own knowledge. Between our familiar talk and our Greek wine, he began to be very loquacious: He told me, his master, after the mode of the Moors, had several wives, besides a captive that he had lately taken, that seemed averse to his passion, and all the rhetoric he was master of could not prevail. He did not know, he said, what country woman she was, but she spake very good French. I imagined this could be no other than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t sweet crea|treature I had seen: I changed colour; but to put it off, said, a pox take all the sex, don't let's talk of them any more. I am afraid, said he, you love to converse with the men, and that makes you slight the women. I did not immediately understand him, but he soon explained upon it, and then I was no longer ignorant. I told him it was of such a beastly, nature that I was of opinion that those persons that used it should be treated worse than beasts. Why, replied he, it is so common here, that 'tis reckoned only a piece of gallantry.&mdash;Well, said I, I hate that action even worse if it be possible than the sight of the female sex.&mdash;</P>
<P>The old man and I parted like two friends; but before he went, I told him he need not give himself any great trouble to
<PB N="28" REF="046409_0027_10215E01868E8720">
lock me in for the future, for I would take care of myself.&mdash;Well, well, said he, and shook his head, I believe I may trust you. As soon as he was gone, I went to bed, not to sleep, for I had thoughts enough about me to keep me waking. I began to conceive a great deal of hopes from my dissimulation. I spent the whole night in thinking of a thousand experiments to forward my designs, till I had thought of so many that they were all con|fused like a skein of silk pulled the wrong way. At last with the fatigue of thought I fell asleep till sun-rising, nor awaked till I heard voices in the garden. I ran immediately and barred my door in the inside, for fear of being discovered at my peep-hole, huddled on my cloaths, and ran up; where I saw my lovely charmer reading in a book, walking by herself in the alley that led to my prison. The other women were got about the foun|tain, admiring the playing of the water. She drew nearer me; but what was my pleasing surprise when I heard her repeat the following lines in English!
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>My grief lies all within,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And those external manners of laments</HI></L>
<L><HI>Are merely shadows to the unseen grief</HI></L>
<L><HI>That swells with silence in my tortur'd soul.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I must confess, the transports I felt were beyond expression: she had such a soft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ss in her voice, and yet so musical, that it made my blood thrill through my veins. In short, during the time I beheld her, I was in such an ecstacy, that all my cares were forgot. She turned up the walk again, but I followed her with my longing eyes till she was out of sight: I then turned them into my imagination, and there behold her still.</P>
<P>I was convinced she was an English woman, and kept in her restraint against her will. I soon resolved with myself to find some expedient to let her know I would serve her all that lay in my power, if she was disposed to accept of it.</P>
<P>I had staid so long fixt at my peep-hole, that the old cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> knocked at my door, which soon roused me from my plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> thoughts, and put me upon another task, which was, to dissemble I suffered him to knock twice or thrice before I let him in; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> last I opened the door when he had called to me to give me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> know who it was: as soon as he was entered, I began to exclaim against him in a friendly manner; said I, You promised me yes|terday
<PB N="29" REF="046409_0028_10215E035641F3C8">
that I should not be troubled with the tongues of those fe|male devils, and I have been so plagued with them for an hour together, that I was obliged to shut my door, and run up stairs to be free from the sound. He smiling, told me, the fumes of the wine which he drank over night had drove it out of his thoughts, but he would be sure to give them a caution to hold their tongues for the time to some: But then, added I, I may be surprised by them when I little expect them. No, said he, I'll take care to send, or bring you word when they are disposed to walk in the garden again. I thanked him for his caution. He told me he did design to come and dine with me that day, For, added he, I shall not have another opportunity a great while, for the captain has sent word he'll be here to-morrow without fail. Accordingly he came with a roasted pheasant and some boiled rice, attended with another bottle of Greek wine.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding my new passion, I ate and drank heartily; but my eunuch got almost tipsy, and the fumes of the wine get|ting up into his head, he desired he might repose himself on my bed for a while, which I granted him, well knowing, if he had been found out, we might both have suffered for tasting the juice of the grape. I had much rather he had gone within the house to have slept, for I could not even think to the purpose while he was there; but he soon got into a found sleep, which I found out by his snoring. I then ventured to take pen and ink, and wrote the following lines.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I had not the conveniency of sealing-wax or wafer, therefore folded it up, and directed it, <HI>To the</HI> ENGLISH LADY. When I had finished, I began to have odd and confused notions of the, success of it: Perhaps, said I to myself, she may be contented with her fortune, or be afraid to hazard any attempt towards her liberty: She may also imagine I am set on purpose to betray her, and therefore, to show her innocency, may discover me to the captain. I was in a hundred minds: Sometimes I resolved to burn the letter; but at last love prevailed upon all my reasons to the contrary, and I resolved to try the success of it the first opportunity.</P>
<P>In reasoning with myself, and writing my letter, I had spent three hours, and therefore thought it high time to awake my eu|nuch, who started up frighted out of his senses. When he had recovered himself, he thanked me for breaking his rest, for he was assured he was wanted within. And he nicked his time to a hair, for before he was got half way to the walk (for I immedi|ately got up to my peep-hole) I saw the ladies at the further end. He talked to them some time, and then left them, to go into the house.</P>
<P>They sauntered about the garden a good while, till at last two of them sat down by the fountain, and the English lady continued her walk towards my apartment. Now my blood ran its swift course, and the whole frame of my body felt violent emotions. I thought this was a fair opportunity, and yet was fearful to make use on't. But mustering all my spirits, I ventured, and when she was within twenty paces of the green-house, I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed the letter, and by good fortune it fell in the middle of the gravel walk, so that it was almost impossible to miss o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t, but had it happened otherwise, I had time enough to run down and take it up before any one else could discover it. She continued her walk, and when she came at it, she kicked it with her foot once or twice, and at last took it up. She was reading in a book, as she was the day before: I could perceive her open it, and spread the note upon her book, so that no one could tell but that she was read|ing. It is impossible to express the anxiety I lay under all this while: but I began to be a little more composed, when I ob|served her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">earing the letter into very small pieces, and scattering
<PB N="31" REF="046409_0030_10215E0A371D5448">
them in several parts of the garden. She had not walked far, but she returned, and view'd the green-house with a great deal of regard, and, to my imagination, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anted to come to the north side of it, as mentioned in the note, yet seemed fearful; often look|ing back, and not fully confirmed in her resolution, at last went unwillingly to the rest of the ladies. This gave me some hopes that she received the letter kindly, and that I should hear from her soon.</P>
<P>I observed she sat upon the fountain very intent upon her book, which did not much please me. In about a quarter of an hour she go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> up, and came towards the green-house again. When I saw her coming, I ran down stairs and fixt a pack-thread to the top of the window, for fear, if she should take courage, and come to that side, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> seeing the pack-thread, she might be startled, and persuade herself there was nothing in't. I had placed it and got up to my peep-hole before she had reached the south side. But coming close to the wall, I could not see by reason the smallness of the hole cut off my sight. But in less than a minute I discov|ered her walking back again, and sometimes turning to view the place of my retirement. As soon as she had got to the top of the walk, (for I had not power to stir before) I went down, and pull|ing in the pack-thread, found a piece of paper tied to it. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|tied it with a great deal of expectation and impatience, and sound these words wrote with a pencil, upon a clean leaf of a book, (which, I suppose she had torn from what s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had been reading in.)</P>
<Q><P><HI>I WAS much surprised when I perused a note I found in the walk of the garden, as believing it directed to me.

<P>When I had wrote this, I went to the usual place, and saw my charmer very near me. I threw it down as before: she readily took it up, and walked back again, tearing the note when she had read it, as she did the former, and went into the house. Just as she was got within the gate, the other eunuch came out, (not my friendly eunuch) and as he was walking along, I observed him picking up the pieces of the torn notes. If any one had observed my countenan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e at this action, they might have discovered the ut|most confusion there. I thought we were certainly undone, and could not tell how to behave myself. I sometimes repented of the affair, but yet I always found my concern was more for her whom I loved, than for myself.

<P>I don't know when I should have recovered out of my fit of confusion, if the sight of my bliss had not done it. She went to the fountain, sat her down upon the margin, and spent some time there, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n rose and made to my apartment: she took two or three turns with a book in her hand, but at last went out of sight, as before.

</LETTER>
<P>At the reading of this paper, my heart ran over with content|ment: and had it not been for the fear of what would happen about the pieces of the letter that were picked up by the cursed eunuch, I would not have known how to have maintained my transports; but the thoughts of that, like water on fire, dampt my joy. I pass'd my time between hopes and fears, till my eu|nuch came to sup with me. I had torn my letter into many pie|ces, and had disposed of all the fragments that had any writing on it: but two or three small bits of plain paper lay under foot. As soon as ever my eunuch spied them, he picked them up, and said I did not not do well to tread upon paper; For, added he, if Achmet had seen you, (meaning the other eunuch) he would have been in a strange passion. He has chid the lady that my master brought home last, very severely, for throwing pieces of paper about the garden, well knowing in could be only she that had done it, because the rest were all Mahometans, and knew the virtue of it. I asked the reason of all this bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">le about a thing we Europeans put to the most servile uses. He told me with some intreaty at last, that all true Mussulmen have a great deal of regard for bits of paper, because the name of God, or their prophet, may be wrote upon it; and they have a tradition, that when they are called out of purgatory at the day of judg|ment, to be inhabitants of the ever-blessed mansions, there will be no other way to come to their prophet Mahomet, but over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> large red-hot iron grate, which they must walk over bare-foot&punc; And therefore, upon the instant as they are going to step upon the grate, all the pieces of paper they have picked up during their residence in this world, will run and place themselves of their own accord under their feet, so that they will be enabled to get to their prophet without much difficulty.</P>
<P>This whimsical story set my heart at rest, and we supped cheer|fully, emptied our flask of wine, which held two quarts, and took our leave. I went to bed, and felt such a calm in my mind, that I did not lie long awake, but continued sleeping till ten o'clock
<PB N="34" REF="046409_0033_10215E13145ADC78">
the next day. I was surprised and vexed I had rested so long, when I considered perhaps that I had lost the sight of my love. I drest myself, and took a walk in the garden, finding the coast clear, as I thought. The sun being pretty warm, I retired to a little shade made by a few laurel-trees; but was much surprised to find her that was ever in my thoughts, fitting under the shade, in a thoughtful posture. She turned her head at the noise I made in approaching her, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ning away. I pluck up (with much ado) courage enough to speak to her; Madam, said I, I would not have you be under any apprehensions. If I had known you had been here, I would not have disturbed you. I will only in|form you, that I am the person, that has vowed to serve you to the utmost of my power. Sir, answered the, I am not at all displeas|ed at this interview, which is merely chance; on the contrary, I am pleased to see the person whom I over hope to be obliged to for my liberty, and wish we could often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that we might con|sult about the means. Madam, answered I, if you'll condescend so far, I don't doubt but to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> opportunities enough. I told her of my plot with the eunuch, and I had some hopes it might pro|duce something. She approved of my design, and my conduct hitherto. She added, that she would take hold of all opportu|nities to walk in the garden (where I had informed her I could see her without being seen) and so we parted for fear of being discov|ered. She went into the house, and I went back to my dwelling, and in less than half an hour the captain arrived. He came to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">etch me to dinner, and told me I had worked by magic, or I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould never have done what I did. He told me, he thought him|self much obliged to me, and that I should find it. I answered him, I was convinced it was but my duty to serve him with every thing in my power, and that, if he pleased, I should make farther improvements. He made me a great many compliments in his way&punc; and declared he would leave it to my better judgement.</P>
<P>By this time, dinner was ready, and I was ordered to sit down at table with him. (for though he had turned Mahometan, yet he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at as we do in Europe, not on the ground upon carpets as the A|siaticks and Africans do. We had our linner dressed after the English fashion, and we drank plentifully of his Greek wine. He told me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he had a dispensation from the Mufti to drink wine, and smiled. I answered I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the crime was pardonable by Ma|homet, if it was thank with moderation. For my part, I don't think, said I, religion con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">l, in castigation and penance; and I
<PB N="35" REF="046409_0034_10215E1568E24B18">
am convinced that an upright man, let him be Jew, Turk, or Christian, may find his way to heaven. We had several dis|course, at dinner about religion, but I soon discovered the cap|tain knew very little of any; and I am of the opinion that very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the renegadoes think of religion; their motive to change, is case and interest. But this is a digression.</P>
<P>When dinner was over, we walked in the garden, and I shewed the captain what improvements I had designed to make. He ap|proved of every thing I said, and informed me that he heard from Mirza, the eunuch, my abhorrence of women. But he advised me to keep my sentiments secret, for when you abjure, said he, the Moorish women will make you feel their resentment. But 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">d continued he, that one of your youth and make should take such an aversion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the female sex. I told him I had very good reasons for my hatred, and even my mother was odious to me, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> brought me into the world. Well, but, added the captain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and a fair face may make great alterations. I told him I was very well assured I should carry my resentment to the grave. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> he, I have a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> English woman, a slave of mine, that I have lately taken, would make you change your sentiments if you saw her. Sir, answered I. I would be glad to stand the trial to convince you to the contrary, though I would as soon look upon a serpent with my will. Well, said he, I have not learned the strictness of the Moo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, in keeping women without being seen; or if I had, your aversion to them would convince me I had not much to fear. He desired me to walk a while in the garden, and he would be with me again immediately. Upon this he left me, and went into the house, and returned in five minutes. Come, said he, I have ordered my women to walk in the garden, and you and I will abscond behind these laurels, where we may see them and not be seen. We had not sat long before we could perceive three women <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> us. The two first were very hand|some, a little inclining to fat; one seemed to be about thirty, and the other twenty-own according to my guess, and not so fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as our English women: but the third was she I looked for. All my cir|cumspection could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> a sudden flow of my blood rise into m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> captain observed. Well, said he, (when they were walked out of hearing) I have taken notice of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> aversion is unsurmountable, which I am not sorry for, seeing it will add to your liberty. I have no o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">sion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> confined when they walk in the gar|den, for I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he, laughing, you'll shun them fast enough

Just, answered I, as I would a creeping snake, unless it were to destroy them, and that the regard I have for you would prevent. The last, said the captain, is your country-woman, one that I took in a ship (my last voyage but one) bound for the island of Zant. I liked her so well, that I refused her ransom that amounted to five hundred pounds, and her charms have overcome me so much, that I would willingly enjoy her with her own consent, for compulsion palls the joy. I have given her twenty days to consider on't, and when that time's expired, if she will not consent, I am resolved to force her.</P>
<P>Lord, (said I in a seeming passion) how can you take such an extraordinary trouble for a thing that does not deserve the least re|gard. If the rest of the world were of your mind, (said my cap|tain) the women would have but a scurvy time on't. Now it's to me amazing (replied I) that men should take pains, live hard, and run all hazards to come home, and spend all the fruits of their la|bour on such trifles, that perhaps have not the least tenderness for them, especially in those hot countries where women are given to be amorous, and yet have but one man to sometimes a dozen of them and more; when perhaps a dozen men would hardly satisfy one woman. Why (replied the captain) that's the reason they are so strictly guarded, we pretty well know what they expect. Now, if I had not this aversion to women (I returned) I have a secret without witchcraft, to make a woman dote upon a man. How, said the captain, have you such a secret? If you'll let me know it, I will not only give you your liberty, but amply reward you besides. Sir, said I, I thank you; but as for disclosing the secret, it is what I never can do; yet 'tis in my power to prepare you a chymical liquid, which, put into white wine, will do the business, though it will take up a great deal of time, and be very expensive. As for the expence, replied the captain, I shan't value it. But in how long time can it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> done? not under one hundred days after projection, answered I. Upon this he paused some time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> a hundred days is a great while, yet I think 'tis better to wait for her consent than to force her. So far (laid I) I think you a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in the right; and farther, (added I) you may continue her affection at long as you think fit, by now and then adding some of the chymical drops into any liquid she shall drink, after she has taken the first prescription.</P>
<P>The contain seemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pleased with my project, and ask|ed me what the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e I answered, I feared it would
<PB N="37" REF="046409_0036_10215E1AD26B5118">
be about two hundred pounds in this country, though it would be much cheaper in England, where the things that I should want were easier to be had; but I told him I could not give him a just account of the charge, till I saw the prices of the things I should want. I told him I should find it a difficult thing to get a still, for that was the first thing I should want. He answered me, he did not question but I should easily procure every thing I wanted for money, and he would take care I should not stand in need of that. He further told me that several Jews in Sallee had all manner of drugs, and he belived every thing else I should want. (For fear of the worst) I told him I should not want my drugs these fifty days, though I should want the still immediately, and liberty to go into the neighboring woods in the night-time, seeing there were several herbs that I must gather by moon light, and when the moon was in its full, in the increase, or decrease, according to the nature of the herb I wanted. He told me I should have all the liberty I required, not doubting I would make any wrong use of it. I told him, to be more secure, he might send who he thought fit to guard me. No, returned he, I leave you to yourself. But you may take who you will with you of my servants, if you want their as|sistance. I told him I should stand in need of some of them some|times. Well, said he, you shall go up with me and take what money you have occasion for. So accordingly we went into a lit|tle closet, where was strong box, which he opened, and took out two hundred and fifty Spanish pistoles; said he, if there's not enough, you may have more. I told him, I was assured there was too much. Well, said he, we'll reckon after the affair is over. And because it will be so long, I will e'en take another cruising voyage, that I may not think the time tedious. I was very glad to hear him say so, because I should have a better opportunity to work my design. Though I dissembled my joy, and told him I be sorry for that, for I should often have something or other to give the woman he designed me to work upon. Well (said he) Mirza shall take your directions. Upon saying this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> called Mir|za to us; Mirza, said the captain, you must observe this person's orders; whatever he commands you to do, you must obey with as much exactness as if you were serving of me. This he told him in the Moorish tongue, but explained it to me in English. Mir|za also told me in French, the commission his master had given him, and farther added, he hoped I would often command him to visit the wine-cellar. I told him we would not want. I advised the captain to let me go to town, to enquire for the still as soon as possible, and to be known to those people that sold drugs.
<PB N="38" REF="046409_0037_10215E1EF4CFB6E0">
Why, if you will (replied the captain) we'll go immediately, upon which I consented. He ordered a horse to be saddled for me, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I went into the green-house to prepare myself; and luckily for me I did, for I found a note fixed to the string which my fair cor|respondent had taken opportunity of leaving, when she walked in the garden by the captain's order.

</LETTER>
<P>How lucky was it for me to find this note! it might have falle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> into the captain's hands, and then we had been in a fine condition. I had time to write but a short answer, which I threw on the ground, and pulled in my string; it was this, <HI>"Hope every thing: write no more till to-morrow."</HI> I locked my door, and took the key with me.</P>
<P>When we were on horseback, our chief discourse was concern|ing charms, philters, and witchcraft. I convinced him there was not any such thing in the world; and my compound was the only thing that could do what was desired. He asked me if I myself had ever tried the experiment: I told him more than once; and related the following tale to him off-hand.</P>
<P>There lived in our neighbourhood, a rich old man, and ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> amorous, but deformed to the last degree: He was round-shoul|dered, broad-faced, blear-eyed, short-nosed, and his mouth as with as his face was broad: a pretty object at one should see.

husband, being well assured her charms would conquer every one that looked upon her. She could not bear the thoughts of the old gentleman, and whenever he talked of his passion, treated him so ill that he was almost distracted. I went to visit him one day, as I often used to do, for before his love fit he was wont to be very good company, and would make as free with his deformity as any body else would do; but I found him now in such a condition that I began to pity him. I used all the arguments I was capable of to bring him to reason, but it was the same thing as to stem a torrent. At last I called to mind this elixir, which I had never tried before this occasion; I was pretty well convinced of its vir|tue from what I saw it was composed of, though the chief ingre|dient is calcined gold.</P>
<P>This wonderful arcanum was found out by an uncle of mine, that had studied the secrets of nature sixty years. When he was dying, he called me to him, and gave it me in writing, with the most solemn conjuration that I should never reveal it, nor cause it to be wrote till I thought my last hour near, and to destroy that which he gave me, in ten days, for fear it should be found by ac|cident; and that ten days would be sufficient to imprint it in my memory: I give it into your hands, said my dying uncle, because I find thy understanding exceeds thy years, and thy aversion for women will never let thee make an ill use of the valuable secret; and further added, that the charge would deter me from doing it upon any slight occasion. I took it from him, with a sacred pro|mise not to disclose it, till on my death bed; for if my uncle had recovered. I must have delivered it up to him again. But he ex|pired in half an hour.</P>
<P>I so far pitied the old gentleman (and also having a desire to try the experiment) that I told him I had it in my power to make the lady as fond of him as love could wish, if he would go to the charge. He told me he did not value the expence, but he had no faith in charms. I convinced him at last, went to work, and ac|complished my affair. The quantity I made would serve a hun|dred years, and I had a little in my trunk when I was trepanned aboard, which if you had the good fortune to have taken, would have saved you time and money.</P>
<P>When I had brought my old gentleman a bottle of my stuff, he seemed even then to have little faith in it; but I bade him have patience till the trial. All he had to do was to convey about for|ty
<PB N="40" REF="046409_0039_10215E220E7D1758">
drops into a glass of white wine fasting. That, he said to me, will be a difficult thing, for I know she hates me, neither will she stay in the company where I am. However, I told him I would do my endeavo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to find an opportunity: so I ordered him to keep a small bottle in his breeches pocket, (for it must be warmed naturally with the heat of the person's body that is to give it); and in two or three days I prevailed upon a relation of mine to in|vite the lady to drink tea with her; I acquainted my old lover that he should come in as by accident, and bring a pint of white wine as a taste of a parcel he was to dispose of. Every thing hap|pened as desired; the old gentleman came in, and got an oppor|tunity of conveying some of the drops into a glass of wine, and I had the satisfaction of seeing her drink it. This passed off, and we parted: But the poor woman in less than ten days, was dis|tractedly in love with the old gentleman, who took his opportu|nity, enjoyed her, and after despised her.</P>
<P>Now the nature of this elixir is, that if the dose is not renewed every time the moon is in its full, the object <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> loved will sink into dull indifference again.</P>
<P>My captain told me he thought I might have made my fortune by such a secret. I replied, I had forgot to tell him, that my un|cle made that one of his articles, that I should never sell a drop of it, and I assured him I would always keep my promise.</P>
<P>Our story brought us to town, and I was very much pleased, for I was both tired of inventing lies to amuse him and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Moorish manner, with one's knees almost to o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">'s mouth; and there's no altering the stirrups.</P>
<P>We alighted at the captain's house; he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t about the town, and in an hour bought a complete still. He went with me to the Jew's that disposed of drugs, and by good fortune, and a good mem|ory, I remembered the names of a great many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P><PB N="41" REF="046409_0040_10215E248889FD48">
I went to bed and rose early in the morning, and seemed to be very busy about the garden. I sent for my eunuch out of the house, and told him what I had undertaken for the captain; but I farther added if he did not sometimes attend me with a bottle of the juice of the grape, I could not possibly go through my undertaking. He answered me, smiling, that he had orders from his master not to dis|obey me in any thing. But, added I, I have a harder task than all this, for I am compelled to have some discourse with the wo|man I am to work upon, to find out her temper; for according to her disposition, I am to add or diminish several of my ingredi|ents. Nothing could have prevailed upon me, continued I, to have undertaken this hateful task, but the hopes I have of liberty; for that is the agreement between the captain and me, if I succeed in my design, which I am in no doubt of. I should be glad, re|turned the eunuch, you might meet with what you desire, yet I should be sorry to lose your good company. I shall, with some regret, answered I, part with you; but desire of liberty, and in|deed of revenging myself on my unkind uncle, which is natural to us mortals, will make me as expeditious as I can in my work. I ordered him to let me have a couple of servants, to go with me into the fields that night to carry the herbs I should gather: and he told me they should attend me.</P>
<P>I now began to think of acquainting the lady with some part of my design, and therefore wrote her a note to this effect.</P>

<P>She came to the old place in an hour after she had brought the last, with another note (as she told me afterwards) but, reading mine, she did not leave it behind her.</P>
<P>After my eunuch and I had dined, I went into a neighbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing wood with two of the captain's slaves that were blacks: I leaded them with herbs of several sorts, any thing I could lay my hand on, and ordered them to carry them into the garden. I had taken care to tie every particular herb with a string, so that there was no danger of mixing; these I hung in bundles upon the branches of several trees in the garden, and out we went again. In short, I gathered a good horse-load of different sorts, and some I laid upon the banks, and others I covered with earth, that it looked as if I
<PB N="43" REF="046409_0042_10215E2A1C591098">
was about business. I could hardly forbear smiling sometimes, when alone, notwithstanding my anxiety for the success of my design, to think how soon I drew in the credulous captain. Then I began to be in a thousand fears of his discovering my intention to some of the Moorish physicians, for, though generally ignorant, yet they would soon have found I was but an impostor.</P>
<P>While I was amidst my fears the captain arrived, whose sight gave me some trouble. He came up to me, looking about him at what I had done; why this looks like work, said he, Yes, Sir, said I, I am willing to begin that I may make an end the sooner: but, Sir, I must intrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> one favour, that you would not impart the secret to any one of your family but Mirza, nor to no one else upon any account whatsoever: if they seem inquis|itive, tell them I am only distilling some simple waters for your closet. I like your advice, answered the captain, and will be sure to follow it: The reason of my coming down now was to take my leave of you, for I design to set sail to-morrow morning early, for I am informed of a rich vessel that will be in our latitude in ten days, from a prisoner that's lately taken, belonging to Spain: I can't tell how long I shall be out, but I hope by that time I come back, I shall find every thing in readiness Sir, I replied, I don't fear but to accomplish my design before you come back. Well, said he, do you think you shall want any thing else? I told him, nothing but now and then a gallon of sea-water. Well, said he, I shall leave Mustapha behind me in town, who shall obey you in whatever you shall command. Well, said he, farewell (and shook me by the hand) I'll just go in and give them a fresh charge concerning you, and then to town again. I was very glad to hear him say so; and he was as good as his word, for in half an hour he took horse. He shook his hand at me as he went by me, and I heartily wished it might be the last time we might see one another; not as I could com|plain of my treatment, for he had used me very handsomely; and if it had not been in regard to the business of my love, I should not have wished him ill.</P>
<P>Mirza came to me, and told me his master had given them so strict a charge to observe my directions, that if I had a mind to dispose of his estate, 'twas his own fault, for, added he, we must not disobey you. Yes, answered I, if ever you find me requiring any thing foreign to this affair, I'll give you leave to deny me; but there's one thing I must command you, since I have the pow|er,
<PB N="44" REF="046409_0043_10215E2BA5E55EC8">
and that is to come and sup with me, and bring some of the nectar along with you, for I am really fatigued with stooping and walking in the sun when I gathered those herbs. Well, answered Mirza, I believe I shall not find much difficulty in obeying your commands; and I have only one favour to beg of you, which is, that you will use your injunctions on Achmet, that he may par|take. Said I, not to-day, Mirza, another time with all my heart. Nay, replied Mirza, it is not out of love to Achmet that I desire it, but that he may be as deep in sin as myself; for if he should ever discover me, I can't tell the consequence. Well, returned I, we'll find an opportunity.</P>
<P>The hour of supper being come, Mirza, arrived with a couple of flasks. We eat and drank so heartily, that Mirza was incapable of helping himself; but was so inebriated with wine, that I began to repent of my plying him so fast. I was forced to drag him, and lay him on my bed. But how to conceal it from Achmet was my greatest care; for I did not doubt but he would be want|ed; and accordingly it so fell out: For about twelve o'clock at night he came, and knocked at my door. I was up, and think|ing of my design. I opened the door, and understood by his signs that he wanted Mirza. I let him know by signs, that I had sent him to gather me some herbs by moon-light. He was satisfied and went back again. Now Mirza kept the key of the gate, so that my story was sensible enough.</P>
<P>About four o'clock in the morning, Mirza waked, but fright|ened out of his wits to find it morning; though I soon composed him, by letting him understand how I had managed Achmet. He returned me a thousand thanks, and told me, he should never be able to make me amends. I asked him, how I should order it to see this woman, for I could not go to work till I had con|versed with her: And yet, by heaven and paradise, said I, I shall be more concerned at the interview than at any thing which ever, happened to me; (and that was but truth, for my mind was per|plexed between hope and fear, joy and anxiety.) I pity you in|deed, said Mirza, and I wish I could any way ease you of the trouble. Well, said I, then let her come alone into the garden, as I am sprinkling my herbs by and by; for I think one woman is enough to plague a man. Oh, said Mirza, all men are not of your mind. But I'll leave you, and hope to find you in better humour when I see you again.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="046409_0044_10215E2E459FC220">
I had ordered a slave to bring me some water, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a large quantity of salt, to mix with it, only to amuse them. With this I sprinkled the herbs I had gathered, and I was very busy about nothing.</P>
<P>I saw presently after, the idol of my soul, and Mirza running before her. When he was near enough to me to be heard, he said, I must beg you to excuse my waiting on you for a little while; for my not being in the house last night, as usual, has let my business so increase upon my hands, that I must make use of all opportunities to regain lost time time. I told him I would not be his hindrance, but was very sorry I could not have his pre|sence upon this occasion, for I should be in a very great dilemma. He made no answer, seeing the lady was within hearing, but re|turned into the house.</P>
<P>As soon as the coast was clear, I accosted her with a great deal of temerity. Madam, said I, the happy time is come, that <HI>I</HI> may tell you, without fear or danger, how much you may command me. Sir, answered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, I am convinced of your sincere desire to serve me; and as I have written to you in one of my notes, if Heaven prospers our wishes, and we arrive safely in England, I hope it will be in my power to reward you. Madam, said I, the success will amply reward me for all my trouble; and as one cli|mate gave us birth, it is my duty to do all I can to serve you, if I had no other motive. But if you please, let us consult, now we have time by the forelock, how we shall order our affairs.</P>
<P>Sir, replied the lady, I am convinced your understanding wants not to be instructed; and, if you please, I'll be ruled by you in every thing. Madam, said I, have you any objection to be dis|guised in the habit of a man? for, added I, we may so a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">comp|our liberty with more ease. I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> objection to it, answered the lady; but how will you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Please leave that to me, I replied, and in less than ten days I hope we shall be out of dan|ger. I then informed her of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> I had laid, which she mightily approved, and told me she thought my understanding outwent my years. I told her some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> life new-edged our thoughts, and if we succeeded, the inspiration came from her. I observe the blushed at my dicourse, yet did not look as if she took ill what I had said. But I was much concerned to see her change the discourse. I did not think it proper to declare my|self any further, hoping, when I had effected her liberty, gratitude would befriend me in her heart. I observed, by her conversation,
<PB N="46" REF="046409_0045_10215E33557AB3F8">
she had a large share of understanding, and a happy turn of wit. In short, this interview had fixed my heart entirely hers. I had several times thought of enquiring into her fortune, and how she was brought into her unhappy slavery, but desisted, till we had more leisure. She told me, she feared we should make our con|versation to long: Not, said she, (with a look that shot through my heart) that I am oppressed with your company, but for fear we may be observed. I told her, I believed we should not have many more opportunities; therefore I begged her to be ready in a few days to leave this hateful place. She answered me, that she should wait with some impatience my commands, and any hour should find her in readiness. She farther added, that she wished she might be as ready and as willing at her last call. I begged her to cast off all melancholy thoughts, and trust to providence. Upon which we parted; with this her answer, that she was ever resigned to the will of heaven; and whatever should happen, she would do her endeavour to make herself easy, even if it was the miscarriage of our design.</P>
<P>When she was gone, I soon found the sight of her increased my passion (if it was possible for love like mine to suffer augmen|tation.) But it was love alone that worked miracles of old; it was love that roused me from supine slavery; for I must own once more, if it had not been for this fated passion, I should never have attempted any thing to regain my liberty. But even my love slumbered now and then, that industrious diligence might wake, and I was resolved to put the design in execution with all the expedition imaginable, for fear of accidents. I went on amus|ing the house with variety of works for my preparation; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was continually ordering the slaves to town, for one thing or oth|er, to strengthen their opinion.</P>
<P>Mirza came to me soon after. At his approach, I did my en|deavour to put on a countenance with little satisfaction of mind, but I am apt to believe I did it but aukwardly. For, as the face is the index of the mind, I am of opinion a person of nice judg|ment and observation may discover a false passion, with as much ease as a jeweller would distinguish the different species of stones, (if we may call them so.) Well, said Mirza, your fiery trial is over; but I perceive by your countenance, your chagrin would willingly wear off, if you'd but suffer it. Why truly, said I, I have two different passions struggling in my mind, that is joy and grief. I am pleased to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. I shall succeed in the affair I have
<PB N="47" REF="046409_0046_10215E34E0881830">
undertaken; and yet grieved that I must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> compelled to suffer the torment I endure to help the operation. Consider the re|ward, replied Mirza, that is to follow. I changed the discourse, that I might not be put to the trouble to speak against my con|science any longer. I told him I should be obliged to go to town for salt-water out of the sea, and other necessaries, that I should stay for. Why, replied Mirza, you may send for salt-water with|out being at the trouble of going yourself. I told him I was obliged to go in person, because I was to take it out of the sea when the sun was in a particular altitude. Nay, returned Mirza, I am only concerned upon my own account, for I have engaged Achmet to dine with you to-day, with a great deal of trouble. Well, answered I, I will not disappoint you. I'll stay one day longer to oblige you. He returned me many thanks for my con|decsension, and went into the house to prepare things accordingly.</P>
<P>All the while he was absent, I was contriving my scheme.</P>
<P>When dinner was ready, Mirza brought it in, accompanied with Achmet. He had taken care <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> several times to bring wine, and had it placed in a vault in the green-house. Achmet made his Moorish honours, and we all sat down, Mirza begged I would call the wine a cordial, that the captain had given me. But I might have called it what name I would, for Achmet did not un|derstand me; for Mirza was my interpreter, and with much per|suasion we prevailed on him to taste it. But when he had drank one glass, he seemed to like it mightily, and soon asked for anoth|er; and, in short, plied his hand to his head so often, that he was obliged to get up, and played such pranks, danced, and sung, and rolled about, that it put us in a fright, for fear some one should hear the noise he made; which to remedy, I made him drink more, till at last he dropt down, and fell asleep. We laid him upon my bed, and did not intend to disturb him.</P>
<P>I told Mirza, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we had accomplished this great affair, I had a mind to go town even then, for the sun stone, and it might not the next day, and I was willing to take the first favourable oppor|tunity. He told me he would do what I pleased, now the job was done. Accordingly I took horses and slaves, and went for Sallee. When I came to town, I found Mustapha at home, who congratulated me with the favour I had received from his master, and farther added, that he had given him full charge to obey me in whatever I should command. I told him I should want his

assistance immediately with a small boat, only he and I, and I begged him to take his quadrant with him, for I should want his art a little. We took the boat he had provided me, and rowed out of the bay till we came to a small promontory, where I desired him to take the elevation of the pole. When he had so done, we laved water into a vessel we brought for that pur|pose, and went home again. From thence I want to the Jew's, and begged he would furnish me with a Moorish habit for my present wear: For the people of the country do so stare at me, said I, being in a different dress from them, that it makes me ashamed. He provided me a very handsome one, which I packed up carefully, that no one should observe what it was I bought several trifles of him that I had no occasion for, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> several times other rich habits; but one thing particularly, that I hoped I should want, which was a pint of liquid Laudanum.</P>
<P>I went to Mustapha, and ordered my things to be got ready&punc; whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> doing, I endeavoured to found him to know whether he had any thoughts about his liberty, for I remem|bered at our first meeting, he declared himself, as I thought, very frankly: But in all his discourse now, I found him of a wavering uncertain temper, and therefore I thought it the wise way to keep my design to my myself, and go another way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> work. I took my leave of him and went home. I unloaded my horses, and took particular care of my bundle of thing. My salt-water, I put into shallow pans in the sun, which in a day's time produced small quantities of salt. I did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to try experiments, yet I was pleased to see the operations.</P>
<P>I began to set my still on work the next day, but was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> interrupted by the hasty arrival of Mirza. Said he.

added, that the ladies had a mind to see my still at work. I told him they might do as they thought fit, but I would get out of the way: and accordingly he went to fetch them. The Moorish women came down the walk in a hasty manner to ob|serve it, but the English lady came alone as usual. I had got on the other side of the laurel-trees, and took care to appear in her sight. As soon as she saw me, she cautiously approached me, and told me softly she wanted to have a little talk with me. I answered her, we had an opportunity very favourably; and then let her know how the other women were employed, besides we had the laurel walk between us, and I was out of sight from every body else. She told me she had something particular to mention to me: she said, we should certainly want money to accommodate us with many necessaries in our dan|gerous voyage. I told her what money I had saved for our design, but that we would certainly have occasion for more, if we were obliged to go to Spain. That was one of the reasons, said she, why I wanted to confer w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> you: it is in my power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> procure a considerable sum, and though it is not so much as I have lost by the captain, yet I have even a scruple to take clandestinely from him what I may say is my own justly. I soon removed her scruples, and then she farther told me, what was in her power to take was chiefly in jewels, which would be better for concealment and carriage than money. By this time she observed the other ladies coming towards her, which she informed me of: upon that I took my leave and absconded. When they were gone off the walks, Mirza came to me to tele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">se me, as he called it, and told me the ladies were mighty well pleased with the view of my work and materials. I told him, I hoped they would not give me that trouble often: he answered, he would take care for the future.</P>
<P>Now the crisis of my project was very near. I went to the town the next day, and took Mustapha for more water; and farther added, I should want him a night or two hence to pro|cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e water by moon-light. He wondered at my proceeding, but his master told him that I was something very extraordi|nary, and suspected me of magic; but he also informed him that I was using my art for his benefit. I told him I had sev|eral materials to wash in the sea-water in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ll of the moon, (which was at that time) and then I should give him no far|ther trouble.</P>
<P>From them thence I went to my Jew's again, and privately procured several sorts of dried provisions, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eats' tongues,
<PB N="50" REF="046409_0049_10215E3DA325E108">
biscuits, dried fish, wine and a small puncheon of water, and several other necessaries, all to be ready at a moment's warning.</P>
<P>When I had provided every thing, I went home again, and got an opportunity the same day to speak with my mistress. I desired she would be ready about twelve o'clock at night, with every thing she has a mind to take with her. She told me she could not tell how to escape the vigilance of the eunuch; for said she, they lock me up every night when they go to bed&punc; Nay, every day when they are not with me. I desired her to leave that to me.</P>
<P>I invited Mirza and Achmet to sup with me that night, for I told them I was obliged to sit up to watch my work, seeing it was coming to a head, and that I was to go to town before day. They complied with my request with a great deal of joy; and the hour drawing near, they locked up the doors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the house, and came with a great deal of contentment in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> looks. We sat down, and I plied them with wine till they thought they had enough. For the finishing stroke, I desired them to drink one cup of a liquor of my own distilling, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> they soon complied with. I went and fetched a bottle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> brandy that I had procured on purpose, in which I had con|veyed a large quantity of Laudanum, to be ready for this oc|casion. I gave them each a large cup, which they swallowing but did not very well like the taste. I told them I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tilled that liquor on purpose to keep the fumes of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> (or cordial as Achmet would have it) out of the need.

ready to go with me that night. When I came back, I found my mistress ready, and something impatient. I informed her she must submit to another disguise. She asked me what that was: I took out a paper of Ombre, and told her she must permit me to rub it over her face and hands; which I did: but the pleasure of touching her flesh in that gentle manner perfectly put me in an ecstasy, which she observed, for I could not help softly squeezing her h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d. She did not seem dis|pleased at my transport, but yet I thought the occasion she had to make use of me made her bear with me. As soon as we were ready we went out, but I first locked the doors and left them as I found them. My mind was confused between hope, fear, joy, and terror, and I did not doubt but the lady was in a worse condition; but all my task was to comfort her. When I had helped her up on horseback, I called for the Italian slave, and we both mounted, for I would not let him walk on fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t as usual.</P>
<P>When we were got safe from the house I began to ask the Italian slave several questions, as, where he was born, how long he had been a slave, and so sorts. I found by his ans|wers that he had no hopes of liberty, for he had sent several letters to his friends in Italy, and never could receive any ans|wer. Then I began to come nearer the matter, and gave him some hint of our design, but with this addition, even death should not deter me from the execution. He had hardly pa|tience to hear me out, but begged he might share the same f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e with me, and if he got his liberty through my means, he should never forget the obligation, but I might be master of that life I should be the means of saving; for, added he, to live in slavery is but to be always dying the worst of deaths. I soon found by his manner of expressing himself, that he was sincere in what he said. At last I told him all my de|sign, which he mightily approved of, and said every thing was so well concerted, that with the blessing of God it could not miscarry.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the captain's town-house, we found Mustapha wating for me. I had considered we could not do without him, yet I would not venture to mention our escape, till we had him safe upon the sea. I ordered every thing into the boat, and to hide my disguised lady, I told Mustapha that is was a young gentleman that had been bit by a mad dog, and I had brought him to dip him in the sea, by the de|sire

<P>When we had gained the main sea, I began to open my de|sign to Mustapha, but was something surprised to hear him cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|out for help. I immediately drew a pistol out of my pocket, (for I had procured several pair) held it to his breast, and threatened him with death that moment, if he offered to open his mouth. I added, that we had gone too far to stop now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and I believe if he had made any resistance, I should certainly have dispatched him.

I farther added, I would not have given him this trouble, if I could have found a possibility of doing without him. He seemed to be satisfied, and promised us all the help he could.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF MISS VILLARS.</HEAD>
<P>MY father's name was Villars, an eminent merchant of the city of Bristol. My mother died when I was very young, so that I could never know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he loss of her. The care of my father atoned for the want of my mother; he gave me all the education&punc; that was proper to our sex: but before I was sixteen years old, my father died. The grief and sorrow I felt for his death was recompensed by an estate of two thou|sand pounds a year, which he left entirely at my own dispo|sal; besides several valuable jewels of my mother's. My for|tune, I suppose, brought me many admirers; but as I was a stranger to love, I had no inclination to marry: yet being pestered so much with their company and courtship, I retired to a country-house near the sea-side; and as I did not care to see any of my suitors, so whenever they came, I always left word I was gone abroad, or out of order; and in a little time got clear of their impertinence.</P>
<P>I had the misfortune to be a woman of business, though young; for my father had several vessels at sea. The captain of one of the ships that traded to Turkey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rought me a hill

of lading, and I happened to please him, (though more than knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill afterwards.) In short, he fell desperately in love with me, but hearing my aversion to matrimony, never de|clared his passion to me; yet by bribes and presents, gained over to his interest a maid that lived with me, who for a hundred pounds had placed him in a closet in my bed-cham|ber. I came and undressed myself as usual, and went to rest: but I had not been long laid, ere I found a person pulling down the cloathes, and attempting to come to bed to me. I was prodigiously surprized and frightened, as any one would imagine. I called for help, but no one came to my assist|ance; for the maid had taken care of that. I got out of bed with much ado, and attempted to open the door, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> found I was locked in. I used intreaties to the wretch, (who was disguised in such a manner that I could not know him, for he had got a mask on) but all to no purpose: he seized me, as I was so faint with struggling that he was very near ac|complishing his barbarous design, when another closet door flew open, (for I had one at each end of the room) and there came out another man disguised. My fear could not be well increased; but I was in such a terror th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not well know whether I was really alive.</P>
<P>The person who came out last seized immediately on the other, who let me go to defend himself. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n to the door, and fear adding to my strength, I burst it open; but how, or which way, I cannot remember. I ran to the maid's cham|ber, and the noise and confusion we were in, alarmed the men|servants. I had slipt on a gown; and when I had got all the men together, I told them the reason of this alarm. They immediately armed themselves, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> up to my chamber, but the persons were both gone. In searching the room <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> found a piece of a mask on the ground, and a handkerchief marked <HI>L.

<P>I searched the closets of that other room, and under the bed, before I would venture. And it being a room where my father used to lie, it had a bar on the inside, so I and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

maid went to bed. Notwithstanding my fatigue, frights, and fears, I fell asleep, and when I waked in the morning, found myself very well. I began then to think reasonably of my last night's adventure, and easily judged, that one or both of my maids must be in the confederacy, for my door never used to be locked on the outside before. I sent for all my servants up, men and maids, and related to them the night's adven|ture. But they brought me word that Miss Susan was not to be found. I sent to examine her room, but I was informed all her things were gone. We all concluded that she was the occasion of the last night's plot. I did not think fit to send after here, rejoicing I had escaped such a base conspi|racy; till going up into my own chamber, I found a diamond necklace, a ring, my gold watch, and about sixty guineas in money, taken away; my escrutiore broke open, and a bill of five hundred pounds that was due taken away. I immediately sent to Bristol to stop payment, but was told, that my maid had come, as from me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or the money, and had received it several hours before. We made the strictest search we could for her, but all to no purpose: So I gave it all for lost.</P>
<P>Six weeks passed on and no news concerning my maid.</P>
<P>One morning, as I was wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">king in my garden, a sailor brought me a letter which was to this purpose.</P>

<P>Now I had heard of one of the Turkey fleet, that was oblig|ed to put into the road by a violent storm; and that it had a sedan made of looking-glass, of a very curious workmanship&punc; designed for a present to the Turkish emperor. I asked the sailor several questions concerning the letter, and he answered me bluntly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could not tell any thing about it; but the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> was a you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> woman, who had fell down their hold, and had almost killed herself; and that they did not expect she could ever recover.

She thanked me, but said, she found
<PB N="57" REF="046409_0056_10215E4EAD29EF78">
herself so ill, that she intreated leave to rest from speaking, a minute or two, to gather a little breath.</P>
<P>I waited with some impatience, but she remained so long silent, that I really thought she was expired. Upon that supposition, I called to her, and she answered me but faintly. Well, madam, said she, as I find you are impatient to know what I have pro|mised you, I will tell you as well as I am able.</P>
<P>Captain Bourn had for many months a great passion for you, but finding you averse to matrimony, he tampered with me, and offered me such large sums of money, that beat down all my guard of honesty, and overcame it quite. He gave me a hundred pounds, besides other valuable presents, to ad|mit him into your closet, before you went to bed; which accordingly (dazzled with the lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re of the gold) I did. You know what followed, and if he had not been prevented by the sudden appearance of another person out of the other closet, would have compassed his design. Said I, eagerly, pray do you know who the other person was? Yes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> returned the wench, it was Mr. Lawrence Kendrick, your former suitor and guardian, conveyed there for the same base intent by your ladyship's woman. How! cried I, amazed, are you sure of that? Madam, pursued she, when you got out of door, Mr. Kendrick seized upon Mr. Bourn, and they struggled together some time; but Mr. Kendrick's mask falling off, Captain Bourn knowing him, cried is it you? In short, they soon came to an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">illement, and went down stairs unperceived by any of us in the hurry; where he declared to the captain, that he had prevailed upon Mrs. Ellis, your woman, for a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of money, to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> him into the closet, which she did unperceived of any. Thus, said I, may ill intentions be ever frustrated!</P>
<P>When she had finished, she begged me to have a little more patience, while she got a little more strength, and she would restore me my money and jewels. I was unwilling to wait long, yet thought fifteen hundred pounds too much to lose&punc; see my necklace, ring, and watch, were valued by my father at a thousand pounds. I believe I had been full three hours on board, and wanted to be at home again; and after she had kept silent some time, I made bold to disturb her once more. I called to her, and told her I had a great way to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and I
<PB N="58" REF="046409_0057_10215E514308B008">
was afraid of catching cold. She begged I would ring a bell that hung by my hand, which I did, and the sailor came in that brought me the letter. Pray, said the maid, is my brother ready to come in? Yes, answered he, and has been on board this half hour. It's very well, said she. Upon that, she raised her hand and unpinned a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that fell down, and let light enough into the cabin, which was dark before; but I thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> her illness was the reason of that. But, to my eternal ama<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ment. I saw her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the pallet as well as ever I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her in my life. Before I had power to speak, captain Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> entered. I could not presently dive into this mystery. I hope captain, said I, at last, that you repent of your rash and bold attempt. Yes madam, answered he, that I did not suc|ceed in't, but I hope I have it now in my power to finish my design. I asked him what he meant. He told me I should soon be informed, and if I would not consent to his embrace he would certainly ravish me that very night. Upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> treatment, I began to call to my servants; but the faithless. Susan told me they were taken care of, and safe ashore. Yes, madam, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the captain, they are twelve miles behind us by this tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; and desired I would look out of the cabin&punc; window, which they had just before opened. I cast my ever behind me, and too soon perceived that we were a consider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ble distance from the land. I did not look long, for the sight soon took away my senses, and I fell down in a swoon, and when I came to myself it was far in night; but I was so saint and ill that my feeble limbs would not support my body. Grief attacked me so violently, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was thought by every body it would soon overcome me. By next morning, a strong fever seized me, and all that I remembered for six weeks, was, that I was put to bed, with the wretch that betrayed me to attend me. But the condition I was in really wrought upon her, and produced a true conversion. She lamented more than I, and cursed herself a thousand times.</P>
<P>When I had recovered my senses, I was wore away to a ske|leton. And sure never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my condition found any relief but death. But it pleased the Divine Being to work another miracle, and insensibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me to my former health of body, but a mind involves in the most cruel torture, past imagination.</P>
<P>When I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> repentance real, I freely forgave her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he captain in all the time had never come near me, but
<PB N="59" REF="046409_0058_10215E52D049B168">
only to enquire after my health, as Susan informed me. But when he perceived I had regained my former health and beauty, as he called it, I was tormented with his beastly addresses. He told me, if I would consent to marry him and forgive the crime he was guilty of, he would immediately steer for England, which he would reach in a few days. I considered I was in a wretch's power, who, by what he had done already, would stick at nothing to gain his ends; I therefore resolved to flatter him, by the advice of my maid; whom notwithstanding she had brought me into these distresses, I had taken into my former favour. In one of his troublesome visits I told him if he would immediately restore me to liberty, I would upon the instant make him my husband, when we could procure a proper person to tie the knot. He answered me, that the only way to secure it to him, was to have possession of me beforehand; and, continued he, if you think the action crim|inal, I'll soon cure your conscience, by the licence of the hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch. For, said he, if you intend what you propose, you will easily comply; and nothing else will convince me of your sincerity. I'll give you one day to consider on it: but, continued the wretch, if you refuse to submit by fair means, to-morrow by force I will enjoy you. So I leave you to consider on it; and saying this, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t us in the cabin. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad desired Susan to conceal our reconcilement from the cap|tain, which she artfully had done; and in the discourse, would often throw in a word or two in his behalf.</P>
<P>When we were alone, I gave myself over to my sorrows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thought of nothing for several hours but my unhappy circumstances. We both continued silent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> considerable time. Nor indeed had I power to speak, though Heaven had en|dued me with that fortitude, that I had sooner resolved to die, than to submit to his curled proposals. I told Susan, that I had determined to put an end to all my sorrows by death; and when that fatal hour arrived of his limited time&punc; I would plunge a knife, I had concealed for that design, into my bosom. This resolution once more renewed our griefs, and we mingled tears together. We wept so much that the fountains of our eves were dry, and we again remained silent. At last Susan broke it with a speech to this purpose.</P>
<P>Madam&punc; in the confusion of my thoughts, I have chose out one that has some probability of success: but it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="60" REF="046409_0059_10215E556634F9B0">
at least convince you of my repentance, and the desire I have to restore you to that peace I have barbarously broke. The captain yet thinks me in his interest, and, if we can contrive it, I'll submit to his loathed embraces in your room, which shall be managed in this manner: You shall treat with him upon it to-morrow morning. The articles shall be these. First, That he come in the dark, and stay no longer tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> one hour with you; and, last, That he shall not repeat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> familiarity, till you are joined by the priest.</P>
<P>I must confess, this proposal gave me a dawn of hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and if we could but succed in it, I should not fear his fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ther passion, when we were landed. For I knew it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to find protection, when once on shore in England, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thought the contrivance sensible enough; for we were mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the same age, and no perceived difference in our ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> at least in the dark.</P>
<P>She left it to me to manage: and I resolved to put on a more composed countenance at the captain's next visit, which was soon after, though he had given me longer time to con|sider. When he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me in, he begged my pardon for inter|rupting me, but he came to make me a present, he said&punc; and, put a little box in my hand, desiring I would open it, which I did, where I found my jewels and money. I re|store you that, madam, continued he, and would not willingly be obliged to you for any thing but your person and even all your fortune shall be at your own disposal, and the mo|ment you consent to my desires, I'll deliver you a paper that shall oblige me to sign whatever terms you shall think fit to make me. I paused a short time, but indeed it was to think what my tongue should utter so foreign to my heart.</P>
<P>Captain, said I, you take the only way to gain your point and I must confess this shew of generosity, though it's in your power to force them from me again, seems a little to lesson the ill opinion I have reason to bear against you; if you please to allow me one half hour to think a little. I'll give you my final answer to-night. He seemed very much overjoyed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my discourse, and shewed it in an extravagant unpolite man|ner, thanked me, and went out.</P>
<P>I did not want that time to prepare what I had to say, but
<PB N="61" REF="046409_0060_10215E570C7F4F70">
I thought it was better than to come into it on a sudden. The time expired, the captain came in with an expecting face. I bade him sit down, which I found by his countenance he took as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> good prologue. Sir, said I, I have fully considered ev|ery thing, and if you will comply with a few articles, you shall have possession of what you desire, to-night. Articles, madam, I'll sign to a blank, replied the brute, if you please. I told him they were only verbal ones: First, said I, I'll have no light in the room; secondly, You shall stay with me but an hour; and lastly, Never to expect any more savours till we are lawfully married. Madam, returned the captain, you so overjoy me that I don't know where I am: I'll comply with all your articles, and you have made me the happiest of mankind. He said a great deal more fulsome stuff that was as nauseous to my ears as a plague-sore to the sight. He left us with a hope I would not long defer his happi|ness. It was well I was in a dark corner of the cabin; for had I been in the light, he would have perceived the confusion in my countenance.</P>
<P>The hated hour drew near, and Susan, with a sincere grief, and tears running down her cheeks, laid herself in the cap|tain's loathed bed. I was really grieved at the sacrifice she was going to make me, for I was convinced she had no loose desires about her. The captain enter'd in the dark, and was as happy as a false imagination could make him. I must confess, I was in a thousand frights and fears, lest the girl should have been discovered; but every thing suc|ceeded too well, and the captain rose within his limited time, and went out.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, the poor creature got up from her guilty scene. Well, madam, said she, all drowned in tears, I hope I have convinced you, though to my eternal cost, of my repentance and sincerity; but I hope Heaven will pardon me, and not lay the crime to me or you, when fatal necessity was the only cause. I gave her all the com|fort I was capable of, and told her, I did not think it impos|sible to oblige him to marry her, when we had him in our power on sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re, and that formality would obliterate all mel|ancholy thoughts. How! replied Susan, no, madam! though I have done all this, yet it was only to serve you; and be|fore I would be his wife, or indeed any man's wife, I would
<PB N="62" REF="046409_0061_10215E59CFE6A208">
submit to the most servile offices of life to support it: and if the captain knew how we had deceived him, and would offer to marry me to atone for his fault, I could not con|sent, for I loathe the very thoughts of him. Well then Su|san, said I, when we have overcome all difficulties, and worn off the remembrance of our sufferings, I will settle a compe|tency of life, that shall put thee above all fear of want. Madam, replied Susan, that's all I shall desire, and then I'll go to some corner of the world, live retired, and repent of all my past crimes and follies. I told her, she need not do that, she might, notwithstanding what was past, live with me. No, madam, that can never be, replied Susan; or you must of necessity, to clear your own reputation, divulge the secret, and then with what confidence shall I be able to look upon any one? I told her it would be esteemed as an ac|tion wholly virtuous, without one spot or blemish. All I was capable of saying could not alter her resolution; but she persisted in retiring from the world, and living in a re|cluse, and I desisted from speaking any more upon the subject.</P>
<P>It had been much happier for us both, if we had never entered upon the argument; for we had not remained silent a moment, before the captain entered, with a light in his hand, and the utmost fury in his countenance. Thou devil! said he to Susan, and hast thou betray'd me, wretch? after what I have done for thee? but I shall study some way to have ample vengeance on thee: and for you, madam, I shall give still the same terms and time I first proposed; but that past, expect not the least hope, for I will enjoy you, though the moment after, death should seize me. When he had&punc; done speaking, he went out: But it was a considerable time ere we came out of our surprise.</P>
<P>We were convinced that he had listened and overheard all our discourse, though we spoke but softly; and we feared to utter our thoughts to one another, as imagining he would overhear us still. But Susan at last broke out in these words&punc; Good Heaven! I hope the punishments I am bound to suf|fer will atone for all my offences: if it will make my peace with thee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'ll undergo all the torments in the world in that blest hope! I had not words to comfort her, for the thoughts of my own condition tied up my tongue; but the pain of thinking, nothing could exceed. I prayed to God to bring
<PB N="63" REF="046409_0062_1021453BDE5365B0">
me out of this misfortune, or give me strength of reason to suffer with patience a dissolution from this world. When Su|san heard me, she told me she could see no path to lead us through this labyrinth of misfortunes, but through the gate of death; and, added she, since we must die once, the sooner we leave this troublesome world, the sooner we shall find rest.</P>
<P>Death still bore to me a frosty sound, however I soon re|solved upon't; but the manner of it was what most confound|ed me. At last we both thought of drowning, and had re|solved, whenever the captain came to accomplish his wicked intent, to throw ourselves out of the cabin-window. Will you so? said the captain, (who had overheard us again, for grief had taken all caution from us) but I'll <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> prevent that. He immediately took a hammer and nails, and nailed the shut|ters so close that it was not in our power to undo them. After he was gone, we spent the night in prayer; and just before the morning dawned, we understood by the rocking of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he ship, the noise of the sailors, and the loudness of the wind, that we were in a prodigious storm. This gave us hopes that the ship would be cast away, and that God had heard our prayers, and would not let us lay violent hands upon ourselves. Nay, deceiving hope was ready to enter our thoughts, that we might be cast away upon some shore, and receive assistance when we least expected it. The storm lasted the whole day, and part of the next night; but as it insensibly abated, so our fears increased. The captain gave us another visit: Well, said he, Madam, I hope you have had sufficient time to con|sider of my proposals, and I am now come for my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">al an|swer. Said I, Heaven has given you an answer by raising the storm; and if you have the least notion of a Divinity, you'll find 'twas his voice that spoke to you in that tempest to desist from such a base attempt. Nay, Madam, if you imagine you can preach me from my design, preach on in God's name. Wretch that thou art! said I, how canst thou mention that sacred name, and yet have such thoughts as he abhors? I fancy, Madam, replied the brute, your ladyship feels the in|fluence of the moon, and for fear I should catch the infection. I'll leave you for a while; but with a word by the bye, if you don't consent the next time I come, by hell! (since you will not let me mention heaven) I'll not only ravish you, but every sailor in the ship shall do so too, if they think fit;
<PB N="64" REF="046409_0063_10215E5DC5EB84A8">
and I believe they are sharp enough set to fall to upon worse food than I shall set before them.</P>
<P>He said a great many more gross things, that would only become his mouth to utter: And to convince you, Madam, that I will do what I say, said he, I shall begin with Miss Susan: Come, Mistress, said he to her, now I have had the first cut of you, I'll let my sailors go to dinner. With this he forced us both on the quarter-deck, and called all the sea|men about him. Here my lads, said he, I have but two dainty bits, and I'll give you one among you, that you mayn'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> think I am over greedy. The sailors stared upon one ano|ther, and did not well know what he meant, till he told them in terms plain enough, with promises of reward to him that should prove the greatest rogue. Susan fell upon her knees, and intreated them not to take pattern from their barbarous captain, but to pity a poor unfortunate woman, reduced to the fatal necessity of living no longer. Some of the sailors made sport with her misery, while others began to pity her. One blunt fellow cried, Damn it! I love a woman well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ough, but don't care to have her forced upon me: it's like eating against one's own stomach. Besides, said another, I suppose there is some reason of the captain's liberality, or he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> part with her. I observed one of them that stood at some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, taking notice of what was done, without seeming pleas|ed. I thought I knew his face too, and he appeared above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> common sailor by his looks and cleanliness. I had not till now appeared publickly. I was determined to speak to him, and to crave his assistance. As soon as he saw me, he seemed amazed, and cried, Bless me, Madam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> how came you here? I told him I was betrayed by the captain. I was informed, said he, that he had two ladies passengers for Zant, but I little thought you were one of them, for I was not on board till an hour after you arrived. I begged he would take me under his protection; which he swore with a great oath that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e would, or the captain should cut his throat. Madam, added he. I am mate of this vessel, put in by your honour|able father; and had been captain, if it had not been for the tricks of that rascal; pointing to the captain.</P>
<P>The sailors were so divided between themselves, that they had not proceeded to any violence with Susan; and she re|mained leaning upon the side of the ship, all drowned in tears.
<PB N="65" REF="046409_0064_10215E5F4FE5CF18">
The captain had all this time been laughing at the disputes of the sailors; but perceiving the mate in conference with me, came up to him, and with a saucy tone, asked him what bu|siness he had with me. I have no other business answered the mate, but to protect her from your ill usage. You im|pertinent coxcomb, cried the captain, I'll teach you to inter|meddle with my affairs; and upon saying this, he lifted up his hand and struck him: But the mate soon return'd his blow with interest, and knocked him down upon the deck. The sailors came and parted them; but the captain swore that blow should cost him his life. He upon the instant ran into the cabin for some instrument to dispatch him, as was sup|posed&punc; but the mate followed him close, and, knowing his violent temper, barred the door of the cabin, so that the cap|tain remained a prisoner.</P>
<P>The mate took from his own cabin (which was near the captain's) a cutlass, and put himself against the door, and swore he would be the death of him that first attempted to release him; and bade none of them offer to stir, till they heard what he had to say.</P>
<P>The sailors had cast off all thoughts from Susan, to hear what the mate could say; who declar'd who I was, and by what means I was betrayed on board. When the sailors found I was their mistress, and owner of the ship, they soon began to repent of what they were going about, and declared they would serve me with their lives. When I found I had gain'd most of them on my side, I told them&punc; my story <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> length, only concealing Susan's affair with the captain&punc; and they seem'd all prodigiously amazed, and stood gaping upon me like so many statues.</P>
<P>The captain in the cabin was all this time swearing, curs|ing and making a noise at his restraint. I told the mate, if he thought fit we would release him. Yes, Madam, if you please, said he, out of the great cabin, but we must confine him some where else; well knowing his turbulent spirit will never be easy. I told him I would be guided by him, and if he pleased to accept of the command of the vessel (if it was my power to give it him) it was at his service. He re|turn'd me a great many thanks, and told me he would be very faithful in his commission. We released the captain out
<PB N="66" REF="046409_0065_10215E629F9BF310">
of the cabin, but as soon as he came upon deck, he was seiz|ed, with a great deal of difficulty, iron'd, and confined to another cabin. He raged like a madman at this treatment, but all to no purpose. I told him he should want nothing but his liberty, neither would I prosecute him as his crimes deserved, when we arrived in England.</P>
<P>I desired the mate to make for Bristol with all the expe|dition imaginable: with a promise that I would recompense every common sailor with double the wages they expected for their voyage. They all huzza'd at the news, and one and all promised to serve me with their lives. The mate told me the wind was against us in our course, but that he would ply it to windward (as they call it) in expectation of its changing. I asked him where we were, and he told me very near the Streights of Gibraltar, and should have been at Zant by that time, but that they were hindred by contrary winds, and drove back by the late storm. I told him how the captain had deceived me, in telling me were not six days from the English coast.</P>
<P>Susan's joy cannot be expressed at our happy deliverance; and you may be assured I was as well pleased as she was, though it did not appear outwardly so much: besides, I con|sidered the mutability of the things of this world: and we were soon taught by experience, the uncertainty of human af|fairs,; for, before the evening, we were chased by a rover, who soon came up with us, and took us after an obstinate re|sistance; though we did not lose one man, but the barba|rous captain, who was killed in the place of his confinement, without being in the action.</P>
<P>The captain of the rover was the same we have now made our escape from. He would never tell me what became of Susan and the crew. Madam, said Mustapha. I can inform you: She and all the crew were ransomed for a thousand pounds, and their ship given them again. They did their en|deavour to ransom you, but to no purpose, for they could never learn what was become of you.</P>
<P>Miss Villars thus ended her relation; only added, that the captain fell desperately in love with her, and would never hear of her ransom; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ough he treated&punc; her with decency, al|lowing
<PB N="67" REF="046409_0066_10215E6532C33D40">
her every thing but liberty; with the conveniency of a study of books, which the captain had procured by his pi|racy; and even left in her closet, her jewels and other things of value, that he had taken out of the ship.</P>
<P>When Miss Villars had finished her story, I returned her thanks for the trouble I had given her. Sir, replied she, thanks will not recompense me for the pains I have taken. I told her, I should readily obey her commands; but I begged leave to give her relation in French, that our Italian might partake; for I design, with your leave, to insist on the same from him. Sir, answered the lady, I would have related my unhappy story in that language, if you had given me the least hint. But however, I'll go once more over again, if you please, in French; at least the chief circumstances, that we may the more engage the person to declare how he has shared the same fate with us. I begged she would give me leave to take that trouble, if it were only to let her see I had im|printed in my memory what concerned her so strongly, that I could repeat every circumstance. She gave me leave to proceed, on which I told her story over again in French to the Italian. When I had finished, she gave me thanks for the pains I had taken. Though I had not been so long in the relation, yet I made up the time in descanting upon the danger and hard fate, that a lady of her birth, beauty and es|tate, should be so far forsaken by fortune, as to be reduced to wretched slavery.</P>
<P>I then began my own story from my birth to our present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Though in what related to my passion for the lady, I did not directly explain; yet I gave her hints enough to understand she was the idol of my soul, and, though love, like hope, does oft deceive us, I thought my obscure declara|tion did not displease her.</P>
<P>We then desired the Italian to proceed in his relation. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ghing, told us, he was too much obliged to me to refuse me any thing, though it would call to his remembrance transac|tions that would bring tears into his eyes. After some pause he began to the following effect.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE ITALIAN SLAVE.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born at the city of Rome, renowned for its gran|deur and antiquity; and I may say, without boasting, of a noble family, but had the misfortune to come last into the world, and the youngest of five sons and two daughters. My father had a plentiful fortune, but, before his death, he had much weaken'd it, in giving dowries to my two sisters, who were both married far above their fortunes, though not equal to their birth. But riches now balance every thing, and weigh down birth and humble virtue, and he that has most gold is the greatest man.</P>
<P>We lost our mother in our early days; and my father fol|lowed, before I was ten years old, having settled all his es|tate on his eldest son, to keep up the grandeur of the name, and left three brothers of us to depend on him.</P>
<P>My father, in his life-time, gave us an education suitable to our birth and family; and my brother, to give him his due, completed us. Two of my brothers he procured posts in
<PB N="70" REF="046409_0068_10215E69455105E0">
the army for, who both lost their lives in one glorious cam|paign. The other died young.</P>
<P>It was imagined by every body that had the privilege to think for me, that their death would be of no small advan|tage to me; and it had for some years the appearance of it.</P>
<P>My brother had attained to his thirtieth year, without once thinking of marriage. But an advantageous match being proposed, it was thought convenient for him to pursue it. The lady that was designed for him, he had never seen; but he was informed she was young, rich and beautiful. He was brought to the sight of her, and fell violently in love with her at the first visit, and his passion increased every moment. The day was fixed for their nuptials by the father of the lady, which was to be the Easter following. I had attained to my eighteenth year, and no provision made for me; and it was thought that this match would not bring me the least advantage.</P>
<P>One day my brother told me, he had procured me the post of captain of the Pope's guards; and though it was beneath my birth, yet I was pleased with it, that I might have the means to subsist, without being subject to the caprice of for|tune, and the dependance of a brother of an uncertain tem|per. My brother having some urgent affairs, that called him hastily out of town, he gave me a letter to deliver to his mistress, which was to excuse his sudden departure.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, I went to execute his commission, and being known to be the brother of the intended husband, had the liberty of presenting the letter to the lady's own hands. But what misfortunes did that interview cost me! I no sooner saw her, but I lost my heart, and the regard I owed my brother was of no force against her charms. I observed she peiused the letter with indifferency, which did not dis|please me. Yet I so far overcame my growing passion, as to add something to the excuse my brother had wrote. I ob|served in our conversation, that the promised alliance was not very pleasing to her; and she at last frankly told me, duty, more than inclination, would make her comply with it. I told her, were my brother's condition mine, and I had been acquainted with her sentiments. I should not have the forti|tude to support my ill fortune; vet should have so much re|gard
<PB N="71" REF="046409_0069_10215E6D39A850A0">
to her, whatever were my troubles, not to be obliged to duty but inclination.</P>
<P>She told me, with a rising blush, those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">spousals never pros|pered, where the hand could not bestow the heart. I agreed with her sentiments; but added, I feared her heart was al|ready given where she could not bestow her hand.</P>
<P>Sir, said she, I have ever been a friend to plain dealing, and truth appears so amiable to me, that I neither will, nor can deny it to you. O happy man, cried I, whoe'er thou art! Fortune has shed her happiest influence on thee, and it is not in her power to make thee miserable when blest with so much consenting beauty. Sir, returned the lady, the person you esteem so happy, is ignorant of my inclinations for him, and fear will make me conceal the secret. And the chief reason why I disclose it to you, is, that you would inform your bro|ther; for, added she, with tears, if I am forced to wed him, I shall be forever miserable. Her grief touched me to the heart, and she observed the sorrow in my face. I perceive, said she, the love you bear your brother affects your breast. Madam, said I, since you have made this frank declaration, I also will be free, and utter all my heart. The grief you see rising in my face, is owing to the torments of my soul. The very moment I beheld your charms, love shot me with his sharpest pointed dart, and all the hope I have is cold despair. She observed my declaration with a great deal of satisfaction, and remained silent some time viewing me stedfastly. Upon which I cast my eyes upon the ground. Sir, said she, (with an unconfirmed voice) I hope you are sincere in what you say, for the supposition of it will draw another secret from me, which is this: the reason why I cannot love your brother is, that I have long since given my heart to&mdash;you: The first time I saw your face, it left its peaceful mansion of repose, and fled for shelter to a stranger's breast.</P>
<P>The joy I felt at this free declaration so transported me, that I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w not whether I dreamt or no; but being con|vinced of the reality, I threw myself at her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and ut|tered all my tongue could express, flowing from a sincere heart. She told me she had resolved on death before she would&punc; consent to wed my brother: and informed me also, that her passion had been increasing upwards of two years.
<PB N="72" REF="046409_0070_10215E6FC2A31068">
The first time she saw me, I was taking leave of my brothers, when they were going to that campaign, from which they never returned. In short, we were as much in love, as ever any two were.</P>
<P>We agreed to meet the next day at the same place, where I had the liberty of coming as her brother-in-law that was to be.</P>
<P>I was impatient for the next day, imagining time to have no wings. But the happy moment came at last. We talked of nothing for several hours, but our mutual love; at last we fell on the ungrateful subject of the approaching nuptials, and how we should prevent them. I proposed to her running away, and tying ourselves fast by the sacred bond of wedlock. Though, said she, I never will be any one but yours, yet we must consider of futurity: I know your fortune is but small, and mine, though a large one, depends upon my father: I'll find some means to defer the marriage; you may do your en|deavour to dissuade your brother, for I fancy fortune more than beauty has gained his heart. I assured her to the con|trary, that he was very much in love with her. We both wished it had been otherwise, but resolved to love on. We parted, though we had not resolved on any thing, and ap|pointed to meet the next day at a private corner of the town, at an acquaintance of mine, that I could confide in; though I would not trust him with the secret, well knowing a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er of importance inslaves the person that discloses it. I told him I had an intrigue with a person of quality, that I must be obliged to carry on at his house; which he consented to very willingly. We met according to our appointment, but an hour before the time prefixt, not willing one should be be|fore the other. She came alone too, for she would not trust any of her servants. We met there every day; and one time above the rest, love being pregnant in both our eyes, I took the happy opportunity, and was blessed in the possession of all I wished on earth: but enjoyment was so far from pal|ling my desires, that it rather increased them. We live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in all the delight of love for a month, but then came the bitte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to all our sweets. My brother arrived, and the fatal day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pointed for the marriage approached. We had given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|selves up so entirely to love, that we did not think of what was to come; or if the intruding thought did creep in, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would immediately l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll it to rest like a froward child.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="046409_0071_10215E71532C8608">
When we parted, it was with such a regret and sorrow, that foreboded our ill fortune. The father of my mistress had ordered every thing for the nuptial solemnity, with the greatest magnificence; but two days before it was to be sol|emnized, it was reported all over Rome, that Don Antonio Grimaldi's only daughter (who was my mistress) was taken dangerously ill. I was not displeased at the rumour, as gues|sing her designs. My brother was never from her, and I was pretty well assured the sight of him gave her a great deal of pain. One day finding my brother very melancho|ly, I asked him if it was the indisposition of Grimaldi's daugh|ter that occasioned the gloom I observed in his countenance. He replied she was the cause of what he felt: he farther added, that he thought her sickness counterfeit, only to avoid him; and that he had many reasons to believe she had given her heart to another. I used many arguments with him to leave her, and that she was not worthy of his farther thought. But he assured me it was not in his power to hate her. I began to reflect with reason on the conduct of my love, and found I had involved myself in a very dangerous and trou|blesome affair: but notwithstanding all my reasonings, I found myself more and more in love; and absence, which cures a light passion, added strength to mine; for I had not seen her in fifteen days. I was resolved at last to visit her, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook the opportunity, when my brother was with the Pope in his closet. I found it no difficulty to gain admittance, they knowing who I was: but, notwithstanding all my endeavours, could not get an opportunity of speaking to her; there being a great many visitants. I took an occasion of feeling her pulse, and we had the happiness of moulding our hands for a moment. I durst not slay long, for fear my brother should come while I was there; and yet I had resolved to inform him of my visit, which I did the first time of our meeting; but added, that it was curiosity, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o oblige him, that I gave myself that trouble. He thanked me, and asked me what I thought of her indisposition. I told him I could not an|swer for the state of her heart, but I was assured that her body was in a violent fever. This I said a little to un|dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e him; for since he could not be persuaded to aban|don her, I thought it would be more to our advantage to make him believe it was a real indisposition. He went to make her a visit that evening, and at his return, told me I had given him true information, for the physicians had ordered her
<PB N="74" REF="046409_0072_10215E7308B8AA80">
to be let blood, and that she was in a dangeroua fever, and her father designed to send her into the country the next day. I was mightily pleased that he was deceived as well as the father, and I did not doubt but she had persuaded the phy|sicians to favour the deceit.</P>
<P>Accordingly the next day she was conveyed in a litter, to a country-house of her father's, two leagues from Rome, up|on the River Tyb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r. I flattered myself, that her being in the country would give me a fairer opportunity of convers|ing with her: but though I tried all the methods imagina|ble, I could not find the least glimpse of hope in above six weeks time. I was perfectly like a mad creature, and all my friends, particularly my brother, took notice of my unea|siness. But I kept the cause of it entirely to myself.</P>
<P>Any one that's a judge of love, and has ever been in my circumstances; may guess at what I felt. All I could learn of my mistress was, that she continued very ill. My mind was tortured with a thousand imaginations; sometimes I thought her false, and that it was her own desire which kept me from seeing her, at other times I fancied she was really indisposed.</P>
<P>A month more slipped away, and I was as unlikely to see her then as at first. One morning my brother came into my chamber, before I was drest. He seemed over complaisant to me, and expressed a concern for the alteration of my temper. I fancy, said he, brother, that love has forced itself into your breast; and that the object of your passion has no regard to the torments you endure. I excused myself to him, that love had no concern in my humour, but rather an inward indis|position of body. He said many kind things upon that occa|sion, promised to assist me all he could, and left me.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, I dressed myself and got on horse|back, in order once more to try my fortune; and I had ta|ken a resolution to see my mistress, whatever hazard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> should run.</P>
<P>When I came upon the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">irt of a wood, within half a league of the place where I was going, I was surrounded by a dozen of men on horseback, who, notwithstanding the resistance I made, got me down, bound me, and carried me into the wood. I imagined them to be thieves by their proceeding;
<PB N="75" REF="046409_0073_10215E766B27ED88">
but they never once attempted to take any thing from me, which altered my opinion, and I began to think they had a design upon my life.</P>
<P>The state and uncertainty of my love, made death look like a friend.</P>
<P>They kept me in the wood till the dusk of the evening, then clapt me into a litter, and travelled hard all night. The next morning I was put into a boat, and hurried on board a vessel that lay a league off at sea. As soon as they had received me, they weighed and set sail; the person that seem|ed to have command in the boat, proved to be the captain of the vessel.</P>
<P>They carried me bound into the cabin. When we were alone, he gave me a paper, which I soon knew to be my brother's hand-writing; and in it an open letter, whose hand I could not tell by the direction. [Upon this the Italian took them both out of his bosom. See, said he, the fatal scroll, which has robbed me of all joy in this life, and which I have kept during my captivity.</P>
<P>The first letter he read was to this effect.]</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>I WILL not call thee by the name of brother; that thou hast basely forfeited. But know the hand of Heaven hangs over thee, to punish thy unfaithful dealing with one, who thinks it the greatest curse on earth that our parents should be the same. The inclosed letter came into my hands by the honesty of her that was commissioned to bring it to thee; who, abhorring thy guilty commerce with her un|grateful mistress, has discovered thy scene of villainy. Know, after thou hast read this, to prepare to suffer for thy in|gratitude. An hour's space is the length of thy life, and I think death too small a revenge for the wrongs thou hast committed against</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>[The other was as follows:]</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="76" REF="046409_0074_10215E7A78984800">
<HEAD>To ANTONIO ALVARES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>LIFE of my life<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I have resolved to hazard every thing to let you know the state of my body and mind. Though body, life, and heart, are entirely thine, yet I fear death will rob thee of them. My counterfeit illness that day you saw me, (without having the happiness of speaking to each other) brought a real distemper upon me, and my fever took away my understanding. I hope I have not in my ravings declared the secrets of my soul. The sight of your brother retards my health, and the hopes I have of my recovery, is once more to see thee, thou darling of my heart. I have prevailed upon one of my women, with presents and promises, who I hope is honest to deliver this to thee. Our private meetings, I fear will prove fatal to me; for I find our commerce, if I survive, will make me a mother; but for fear it may touch me more in what thou art to suffer, if known to be the father, death shall release thee from that danger.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>Upon reading of these two letters, different passions swelled in my soul. My heart was torn with agonies for her I lov|ed, and my breast was fired with revenge against my unna|tural brother: for as he had shook off all brotherly love, I thought it was but justice I should do so too.</P>
<P>I sat a considerable time in the utmost agony, not for fear of death; for I must confess I had not the least thought about it. The captain of the vessel seeing me in that condi|tion, spoke to me after this manner. Sir, though I am well paid by your brother to end your life, yet I have so much compassion for your sufferings (knowing your crime to be only love) as to mitigate your sentence: I'll put you into a boat, with two men to conduct you, and every thing that shall be ne|cessary, upon this condition, that you will give me your word and honour not to appear at Rome in forty days.</P>
<P>I thanked him for his kindness, gave him my word, and told him it was not in fear of death, but only to disappoint my barbarous brother. Immediately a boat was ordered out, and every thing that was needful for a month's voyage. My two
<PB N="77" REF="046409_0075_10215E7C28256B88">
men were paid for the voyage before-hand, and we left the ship. I ordered them to steer for Leghorn, because there I could be furnished with every thing that I wanted, from my sister, who had resided there two years with her husband, a nobleman of Florence. But the wind not proving favour|able, we were drove out of our intended course, and had it not been for a French vessel, bound for Malta, who took us up, we had certainly perished. And happy for me, had it been my fate to have had a wave for my winding-sheet: for two days after, we were on board a Corsair of Barbary, who met with us, and took us all prisoners.</P>
<P>I made no extraordinary appearance, seeing I was always disguised when I went to the house where my mistress lay indisposed. Hamet (the name of our Irish renegado) valued my ransom but at two hundred pounds. I wrote to both my sisters several times, and laid before them my unhappy condi|tion, but never could hear from them. So that I either fear|ed my letters had miscarried, or they were willing to forget an unhappy wretch like myself. Though, to say the truth, I never received any hard usage from Hamet; therefore, if the Divine Being will favour us in our escape, I'll faithfully send him my ransom.</P>
<P>When he had ended his story, we condoled with one ano|ther, for our misfortunes had a resemblance. By this time the day began to dawn, and Mustapha told us we should reach Magazan before night. We were all mightily overjoyed; because we expected to be a day longer in our voyage. I begged the favour of Miss Villars to let me cleanse her face <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">win the omb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, which she consented to. I was filled with contemplation of her beauty, but was roused from these pleas|ing thoughts, by the appearance of several lowering clouds that seemed to threaten us with a hurricane; frequent in those parts; and though they seldom last long, yet they might prove dangerous to our small vessel.</P>
<P>Mustapha advised to make to shore, but I could by no persuasion agree to that, but ordered him to hold on his course for Magazan. But the tempest rose so suddenly, and so vio|lent, that we were obliged to leave ourselves to the mercy of the waves: and we did not know which way we drove, for the dark clouds had almost formed another night.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="046409_0076_10215E7DC1A49010">
Our boat was a new stout boat; and bore the weather very well, but it frightened Miss Villars very much; and I had no other regard but for her. The tempest continued for near half the day, and when it grew calm, and cleared up, we were not in sight of land. By good fortune I had provided a compass; and I ordered Mustapha to steer due south, the same course we kept before the storm began, which was be|fore the wind. But though we had sailed several hours south, we could not discover any land. Mustapha advised us to put to windward back, for he did not doubt but we had over|shot Magazan in the storm.</P>
<P>We were preparing to tack about, when we discovered a sail whin half a league of us; for it was hazy weather not|withstanding the storm was over, or we should have perceived her time enough to have avoided her. We kept upon a wind, and it freshening upon us our sail split, and we found it was impossible to avoid the ship who gained upon us every mo|ment. We thought it our wisest course to lay by, and wait for her. Now, all the hope we had, was, that the vessel would prove a ship of Europe. I desired Miss Villars to conceal her sex, and begged the favour of the Italian and: Mustapha to keep the secret. The ship was near us, and to our surprising joy, hoisted French colours. We immedi|ately put on board, because they lay by on purpose.</P>
<P>We were soon informed that Monsieur Pidau de St. Olon was on board, the ambassador from the King of France to the Emperor of Morocco, to treat of peace between the two crowns. I immediately begged to be brought to the ambassador's pre|sence, who received us very kindly. I told him all our sto|nes, but conceded that of Miss Villars, for fear of any ac|cident. He used us very civilly, and promised us protection. He said his affair would not detain him long, and be would be sure to gain safe conduct for us into our own country.</P>
<P>I returned him thanks for his generous proffer, and beg|ged he would command my life, to see how readily I would obey him. He told me, since I was willing to oblige him, he would soon put it in my pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r to serve him.</P>
<P>I have, said he, lost three of my retinue in the voyage, two by sicknes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and one drowned by accident. You'll just
<PB N="79" REF="046409_0077_10215E811DA7E758">
make up that number, and you need not take any care for habits; I will provide for you. The fourth person in your company I believe you'll be satisfied should be taken care of on board our ship, for his landing on the African coast may prove prejudicial to your affairs. I was mightily pleased with his proposals, and communicated it to Miss Villars and our Italian gentleman. Miss Villars told me she was entirely un|der my conduct, and the Italian thought he should have a better opportunity of getting into his own country from Mequine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> than France. I would not suffer Monsieur St. Olon to cloth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> us as he proposed; for I had procured of the Jew four rich suits of European cloth for a trifle, which I de|signed for Miss Villars and myself; for we intended she should put off her Moorish dress the first opportunity.</P>
<P>The ambassador provided a cabin for Miss Villars and me; and he seemed mightily taken with her youth and beauty (as a boy) and he would often say, nature had mistaken her, de|signing her for the fairest of the softest sex. These encomi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> made me very uneasy, fearing he should find out the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">th. But, I understood afterwards, he had not the least mistrust.</P>
<P>He treated us very splendidly at supper, considering we were it sea. When the ambassador went to rest, Miss Villars and I retired to the cabin allotted us. What a sensible pleasure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I feel to have the happiness of her company alone, with|out the fears and terrors of offending any one! She per|ceived a satisfaction in my countenance, that spoke the joy of my heart; and by her discourse that ensued, she was in some fear left a guilty thought&punc; had worked that change.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyle, said she, I hope you know what regard to pay my sex, and do not wrong the good opinion I have conceived of you. I owe the greatest obligation so you, and I am not displeased I am in your power, while you use that power with moderation. I had hardly the patience to hear her out. Madam, replied I, be assured your own soul shall not be more pure than my thoughts. But yet I will take the freedom to declare, no person in the world has that command over me as you have. I must own you have it in your power to punish me by slighting a heart full of the most tender regard for you; and all I ask is only leave to hope; if I am de|nied that, the utmost of my resentments to you, shall only be
<PB N="80" REF="046409_0078_10215E82A8C33DE0">
in hating life, which will be a burden not able for me long to bear. It would be base for me, said Miss Villars, to give torments where I am obliged; I think to disguise our thoughts is an art better lost than learnt: and to deal frankly with you, I cannot find in my heart any aversion to you; which is a declaration, if you know my temper, that ought to satisfy you. I said all the tender things I was capable of, in re|turn for this great blessing, and our conversation lasted sev|eral hours. I told her at last, I was well assured she want|ed rest; and whatever pleasure I took in her company, I would deprive myself of it, and leave her to repose.</P>
<P>She seemed very much concerned, that I was obliged to leave her alone: well knowing I should not get the con|venience of a place of rest to myself.</P>
<P>I told her there was not any fatigue I would not undergo for her with pleasure. I left her, and night soon slipt away in pleasing imaginations. I was surprised to see her who was ever in my thoughts, come out of the cabin dressed. Ma|dam, said I to her, I hope you have had nothing to dis|turb your sleep. She obligingly answered me, nothing but the thoughts of your waking; and therefore she desired I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> would go and repose myself in the cabin, and I think, said she, 'tis my duty to watch now. I excused myself and told her it was but for one night more, for in all probability we should land the next day, and provide ourselves with be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er accommodation.</P>
<P>We went into the cabin together, and our conversation chiefly entered on love. She told me at last, she would leave her acknowledgments to me, till she was more at liberty, and in their own country, for fear I should imagine the need she had of my service, should make her declare herself in my favour. When I found so fair a beginning, I was resolved to push my fortune, till with many intreaties, vows, and oaths of my fidelity, she owned to me she had a tender regard for me when she saw me first for she was convinced of my love at our first conversation: not, continued she, that I had any understanding in the art of love, but knew the hazard you bad put yourself in to serve me, could have no other motive but that passion; and the more I thought of it, the more I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my heart inclining to believe you.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="046409_0079_10215E8507277390">
Those persons that have felt the soft passion, may make a judgment of the transports I was in at this declaration. I kissed her hand a thousand times, and pressed it to my heart. She begged me to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rb my transport, for fear of being over|heard or observed: for, continued she, you may remember, in my relation of my misfortunes, how near we were suffer|ing by such an oversight. This kind caution bridled my tongue, but could not command my eyes; they spoke the language of my soul.</P>
<P>Our silent conversation was disturbed by the joy of the sail|ors in discovering land: and we thought it prudent to wait on the ambassador, and congratulate him upon it. He re|ceived us very kindly, and told us he was pleased upon our accounts, that we might recover on shore the fatigue of the sea and our captivity. The captain told us we should come to an anchor before dinner in the port of Mammora. I was mightily surprised to find that we were got south of Sallee, and found that the tempest had drove us back beyond Sallee several leagues. This we still esteem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> a greater hap|piness, and if Mustapha had not been guided by me, we had missed the good fortune of meeting with the French vessel, and or course made the port of Sallee whether we would or no, Upon this thought, I began to imagine that Mustapha, as understanding the mathematics, knew where we were, and con|sequently had designed to betray us. I communicated my thoughts to Monsieur St. Olon, and he came into my sen|timents. He immediately called the captain of the ship, and ordered Mustapha to be strictly guarded in his absence, and if any Moors came on board, to prevent his seeing of them; but desired that he might want nothing but his lib|erty. When we came to an anchor, the captain was sent on shore to acquaint the Moors with the arrival of an am|bassador from France: and presently the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rt saluted him with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne and twenty guns, which was returned from the ship gun for gun. The governor of Mammora, in an hour's time, came on board attended, who saluted our ambassador, and beg|ged he would have patience to stay in the ship, till he had acquainted the emperor, his master, with his arrival. The ambassador invited him to an entertainment; and though I observed he refused wine, yet he and his retinue swallowed the punch so fast, that their heads proved as light as their heels. When they went on shore again, the cannon of the

ship gave them a salvo, which was returned by the fort, as soon as ever they were landed. The next day an order came from the emperor that we should immediately repair to Me|quinez, the place where the emperor resided.</P>
<P>The next day the ambassador set forward with his whole retinue, among which were Miss Villars, the Italian, and my|self, dressed richly, after the European fashion. We were provided with dromedaries to carry us, all but the ambassa|dor, who was presented with an Arabian courser. Within a mile or two of Mequinez, we perceived the king at the head of his army, in a great plain. At first I thought it a mark of respect to the ambassador of France; but found it was purely accident, for our guide led us out of the way to avoid them.</P>
<P>When we arrrived at Mequinez, we were led to a house belonging to the French consul, or rather a house he had hired for that occasion. Before we were well entered the house, a guard of Moors was fixt upon us, and strict orders given that not a soul should stir out, not even the ambas|sador or consul. I thought this an odd proceeding, and some|times imagined it was upon our account, as fear is an ex|peditious painter, but my timidity vanished, when Monsieur St. Olon informed me, it was the Moorish custom not to let a foreign ambassador give or receive visits till after his first audience.</P>
<P>Miss Villars and I had an apartment allotted us, with but one bed in it, after the Moorish manner. She told me, she could not bear the thoughts of my watching every night, and begged I would go to rest with the Italian; but we found he was provided with a companion, one of the retinue, and there was no help for it. I always retired when my mis|tress undressed herself, and gave her time going to bed: I then with a quilt laid myself down on the floor, but was far from taking my repose. The thoughts of the woman I loved being so near me, naked in bed, kindled such a de|sire in my breast; and the pain I took to smother it, per|fectly burnt me up. I would have my readers excuse me, if they are disobliged at any part of my story, because I am only relating matters of fact.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="046409_0081_1021453A58662B88">
The next day, when I rose from my boarded bed, I re|tired to give the loadstone of my desires time to dress her|self: when I entered the room again, she observed my coun|tenance very attentively, and told me she was grieved to find in my features, something that spoke a disordered body; which I am sure, said she, is for want of rest, but, added she, I beg it as a favour you will immediately undress yourself, and go into bed, and try to repose yourself, and I'll make your excuse to the ambassador. I refused a great while, but in short, she forced me to comply with her commands. I went to bed, but new thoughts again attacked me, and drove sleep away. Miss Villars had retired, and staid about an hour. When she came in again, she stole softly for fear of dis|turbing me. My mind was so violently agitated, that I re|ally began to be out of order, and feverish, which she ob|served, and came to the bed side, and with a tender inqui|etude, asked me how I did. I took hold of her hand, pres|sed it to my lips, and thanked her for her kind care of me. Alas! she cried, you are very much indisposed, and I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he cause of it. Upon this the tears ran down her cheeks like morning dew on roses. Her tenderness gave me all the joy imaginable: and as she leaned her h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad over me, weep|ing, I pressed her soft lips close to mine, which plunged my soul in exstasies of joy. She blushed at my freedom, yet still begged I wauld try to sleep. I told her it was impossible, while she was there; upon this she was going to retire in haste, but I caught her by the soft hand, and told her if she went out, it would be a greater impossibility for me to rest. She conjured me by that love I professed, (if it was not falsehood) to declare to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he torments of my mind. She insisted so much upon't, that I told her the secret of my heart. She fell upon her knees, and begged I would not mention it any more; for she owned herself so much obliged to me, there was not any thing in her power she could refuse me, but that. I begged her pardon, and had resolved to suffer death sooner than to have disclosed my mal|ady; but I would be ever silent upon that theme, till she commanded me to speak. My dear Boyle, said she, (I am not ashamed to call you so) stay till we arrive in England, and here I v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w to make you mine whenever you shall com|mand me. Upon saying this, she joined her lips to mine, not considering that endeavouring to suppress my flame, she poured oil upon it, and made it burn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he fiercer. I told
<PB N="84" REF="046409_0082_10215E8EF3D8FAD0">
her true love was above nice formality, and that marriages were made in heaven. Said she, I hope they are, but beg|ged; by both our loves, to drop this theme; I told her I would, though death would follow. I remained silent for some time, while tears stopt her speech. We were inter|rupted, by a messenger from the ambassador, who came to invite us to dinner, (for he always allowed us the favour of dining at his table.) I begged to be e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">sed, for I found myself a little indisposed. The messenger had not been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a moment before the ambassador came in to enquire after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> health, and brought his physician with him, who, feeling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pulse, told him I was in a fever, but bleeding he did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> doubt would give me ease. I told him, I should be bet|ter in the morning, if not, I would take his advice. The ambassador would have Mr. Villars (as we had named her) to dinner with him, who had endeavoured to compose her|self while they had been in the room. As she was going from me, she squeezed my hand, and said, Endeavour to com|pose yourself to rest, and you'll soon be better.</P>
<P>They retired and left me to my own thoughts, which were various and disjointed. Miss Villars did not stay long: she came in softly as before, expecting that I might have been asleep. When she found I was in the same disorder, she burst into tears, and cried, Will nothing satisfy you but my undoing? No, madam, said I, I will fight with my desires, and am resolved to conquer or die. She staid with me till supper, and our whole discourse was upon the passion of love. When she came back from supper, I had got up and had drest myself; but the combat in my mind had really disordered my body, which she soon saw: she beg|ged I would go to bed again, and she would watch me. I told her, the world would not prevail upon me to break her rest, nor even she herself, who was more to me th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the world. I had sat me down upon the bed, and Miss Villars came and sat down by me. We remained silent a considerable time: at last she took my hand in her's and pressed me by the fingers.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyle, said she, I have overcome myself: I cannot see you in this torture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">dy and mind and not contri|bute to your case. Here, solemnly swear to be my hus|band, and do with me what you please. I hope you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="85" REF="046409_0083_10215E9085847DA8">
a man of honour, and that's what I rely upon. Nothing in this world could have transported me so much as those few words did: I fell upon my knees, kissed her hands, and did I know not what! Madam! said I, you have made me the happiest man the world contains; and if I thought my heart and tongue did not agree in what I am going to say, I would pull them both out this moment. When I had said this, I fell on my knees, and made this short vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> "Thou God that knowest the heart of man, I do beseech thee to pun|ish me with eternity of torments, if ever I prove false to this darling of my soul, whom before thee I take (as the greatest blessing) to be my lawful wife." "And here, I swear (said she, kneeling) to take no other to my bed and heart; and with this kiss, said she, I seal the sacred union." I told her nothing could be more binding, and the priest could but con|firm what we had done already.</P>
<P>Now the tender moment was approaching to crown my joys with all I wished on earth. Kings on their thrones to me seemed poor and base, and I'd not have changed to be the monarch of the universe. I begged my dear bride I might be her bride-maid as well as husband, and that she would give me leave to undress her. Said she, My love, my life, my husband, I am to obey you in every thing that's in my power, and when I fail in my obedience, may I be misera|ble in the loss of you. I was too eager to say any thing in return, but I undressed her, put her to bed, and you may be sure I did not stay long behind. The veil of night was drawn round us, and I plunged into a sea of pleasures too delicate for words to express.</P>
<P>The next day, the ambassador saw contentment in both our faces, and congratulated me for the recovery of my health. Never was there so tender a wife; and the longer I had the happiness of enjoyment, the more my love was raised. The next day the ambassador was to have his first audience, and we were all to be in readiness by seven in the morning. I got up early and dressed my dear wife in a new suit of cloaths, on purpose for this occasion. The governor of Alcassar, Hamet addo Riffy, was to be our master of the ce|remonies, who attended us with several Moors of quali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, and a troop of the king's blacks, as guards. We set forward about eight o'clock, in this order. 1<HI>st.</HI> Twelve of the Moor

guards. 2<HI>d.</HI> Several of the nobility, two by two. 3<HI>d.</HI> The ambassador, with Hamet addo Riffy on his right hand, pro|ceeded by two trumpets and kettle-drums, (the post of hon|our is on the left among Moors, because you have the com|mand of their sword.) 4<HI>th.</HI> Twenty-four gentlemen of the ambassador's train, two by two. 5<HI>th.</HI> Twelve French slaves that carried the presents. 6<HI>th.</HI> Twelve more of the guards; and the order was closed by a Moorish mob, that abused us with their tongues all they could; nay, some of them at|tempted to throw stones, but were bastinadoed by the guards. We were all on foot, though the king's palace was a mile from the place where we sat out.</P>
<P>I was mightily concerned at the fatigue my dear wife un|derwent, for it was violent hot; though we had the best on't for going next the ambassador (who ordered we should do so) we had some shelter from the umbrella that was car|ried over his head.</P>
<P>We entered the palace through the marble gate, (so cal|led from two marble pillars that adorn it) and from thence immured with white walls and black guards on each side, we arrived at a stately pavilion; where a halt was commanded till the king was acquainted with our arrival. We waited some time, but at last saw him coming, mounted on a white horse, through one of the avenues that led to the pavilion. His guards (who had lined that passage on each side) bowed down to the ground as he passed along. He made but a very indifferent appearance. As soon as he came to the po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|tico, he gave a lance that he bore to one of his guard, got off his horse, and squatted down upon the floor, without any|thing under him. He had nothing in his dress to be dis|tinguished from the rest of his subjects, but was muffled up to the eyes with a chocolate-coloured handkerchief, that did not seem over clean. His legs and arms were bare: as to his age, he seemed to be about fifty; of a very tawny com|plexion, and very lean: his hair black, inclining to grey; of a middle stature, with hollowed cheeks, and eyes black, a small ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed nose, and thick lips. Some of his courtiers sat down on each side of him, bare-legged and bare-headed; and behind him stood a black with a great fan in his hand, not only to cool him, but to keep off the musketoes, a small fly, very troublesome in most parts of Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="046409_0085_10215E948FDDA928">
Mahomet ben addo Otar, his chief minister and favourite, was the only person that stood.</P>
<P>As soon as the emperor had squatted down on the floor he repeated these words in Arabic three time, <HI>"Tay boun,"</HI> which is as much as to say, "You are welcome;" a com|mon expression when they are addressed by a foreigner. Then our ambassador made a long speech in French, prepared for that purpose; which was only a panegyrick upon both kings, fulsome enough; but the French deal much in wordy compliments. The interpreter when the ambassador had done, read the same in Arabic to the emperor. The speech was very long in French and Arabic, but the emperor heard it out patiently, which was reckoned a good omen; he also excu|sed himself that he did not admit him sooner to his audi|ence, it being the Ramadan or Easter. When the compli|ments were over, the ambassador presented all his retinue to the emperor, but I observed he took a particular notice of my wife, and eyed her several times, which gave me a great deal of uneasiness; for it is as dangerous to be a handsome man as a handsome woman in Morocco, if the brute of an emperor should have a fancy for them.</P>
<P>I longed to have an end of audience.</P>
<P>After we w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> presented, the ambassador ordered his pre|sents to be opened and spread before the emperor; which consisted of fine arms made at Paris, several English watches, cloth, two Persian carpets, and two pieces of gold and sil|ver brocade. The emperor, in return, gave the ambassador four young slaves, three of them French, (though he took them all for the same nation) but the other was an English|man, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> same person I mentioned in the beginning of this relation, who went in the same boat on board the Success. I was very much confounded at seeing him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell knowing he was on board when I fell out of the ship. I longed for an opportunity to confer with him, though I could not per|ceive by his looks that he knew me; but that might be from my change of habit, and the sun's tarnishing my complexion.</P>
<P>The emperor rose, (when he had given the slaves) mounted, and rode off; and we went home in the same order as we came there; only the chief minister, Mahomet ben addo Otar,
<PB N="88" REF="046409_0086_10215E98C5BB1638">
accompanied the ambassador as far as the marble gate. I in|formed my dear wife when we came to our lodging, the anx|iety I was in when the emperor eyed he: She told me she had made the same observation with much uneasiness: for, said she, I had not the presence of mind, upon the instant, to imagine myself a man&punc; However, we both wished our|selves on board, and the embassy well over, and then we might make ourselves merry with our fears.</P>
<P>The next day our fears were much increased; for hear|ing a noise in the street, we went to look out to know the reason, and discovered Hamet our Irish renegado, with sev|eral prisoners manacled. We soon retired again, but learnt by other people that they were going to the emperor that he might make his choice. The sight of him renewed our fears, as I said, and we resolved immediately to get leave to go on board, for fear of some unlucky turn of fortune.</P>
<P>I, upon the instant, went to wait upon the ambassador, and declared to him what I had seen, begging leave at the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me we might be suffered to go on board. He told me he would comply with my request for Miss Villars and the Italian, but begged it as a favour that I would stay with him, for he should have great need of my assistance; and if any thing should fall out, he would engage for my liberty. Though the request out me to the heart, yet it was neither prudence nor good manners to refuse him. I gave him my promise to obey his commands, but begged he would not insist upon my going abroad but as seldom as possible. I went to my wife,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>My readers, perhaps, may smile at my calling her wife, but I will assure them, we thought ourselves as much mar|ried, as if the parson had executed his holy function; nev|ertheless, we did not intend to neglect that ceremony the very first opportunity.</HI></NOTE> and told her the ambassador's request and my promise. She agreed with me in the reasonableness of it, but yet could not forbear shedding floods of tears at our (we hoped) short separation. The next day was designed for the journey; but the ensuing night was spent with sighs, tears, and lowness of spirit that looked ominous. Yet we parted; and for sev|eral hours I could not bring my mind to any peaceable form

to wait on the ambassador: but he sent for me at last, and told me the reason of his desiring me to continue with him was this&mdash;</P>
<P>The king, his master, had commanded him to make some observations of the customs and manners of this part of Af|rica; and, added he, I have observed in you a capacity fit to assist me in the design. I told him he might command me in any thing that lay in my power, and that I took it for an honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e would think me worthy of his employment.</P>
<P>We had notice the next day from the person that attended my wife with the camels, that he saw them safe on board, which gave me some comfort. I begged the ambassador to give me leave to speak a word or two with one of the slaves that the emperor gave him. He ordered him to come be|fore him, where I desired he would tell me how he came into the hands of the Moors. He was prodigiously surpri|sed to see me there, and could hardly believe his eyes; for it was thought by every body that I had either been killed or drowned; as indeed it was very improbable to think oth|erwise. He informed me, that three days after the Success parted with the Spanish man of war, another Algerine rover met with them, and took them after an obstinate fight; the captain and several others being slain in the battle: but it was his good fortune to be brought for the emperor's use. I call it good fortune, said he, because I was presented to the French ambassador, and I am now in hopes of my freedom.</P>
<P>I told the ambassador in French what he said; and he was pleased to say, that to oblige me he would take him into his protection. I remembered Mahomet ben addo Otar was ambassador in England; he came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o visit the ambassador often, and understanding English, I gathered several good hints for his design; for he was courteous enough, though an en|emy in his heart to the English.</P>
<P>I think it will not be much amiss here to give the reader a succinct account of the customs and manners of the Moors of Fez and Morocco; and we will begin from their last revolution.</P>
<P>Muiley Ismael, the present emperor of Morocco, pretends
<PB N="90" REF="046409_0088_10215F7AA9DFA678">
to derive his birth from Mahomet himself. He was son to Muiley Xerif king of Taphilet, but was succeeded by Muiley Archyd, who died with a debauch he made among his courtiers.</P>
<P>His unexpected death in 1672, gave room for many of his family to raise rebellion in their several provinces: But Mui|ley Ismael being the greatest favourite of the people, and of an enterprising temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, proclaimed himself king of Taphilet, and seized his brother's measures, which are the sinews of war. His nephew, Muiley Hamet gave him the most trouble; for he had gained a party, and declared himself king of Sus and Morocco, had several battles, but at last was overcome as well as the rest, and Ismael was settled the peaceful king of Ta|philet, Morocco, and Fez. I have given a description of his person already. His empire spreads from north to south four hundred leagues, from east to west upwards of a hun|dred and fifty.</P>
<P>There are three strong places possessed by the Europeans on the coast of Africa, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Magazan on the ocean, by the Portuguese; and on the Mediterranean, Melissa, and Centa, by the Spaniards. They had two more strong holds, Larache and Mammora; but the present emperor drove them out shame|fully. And Tangier once belonged to the English, who aban|doned it a few years ago, first demolishing the fortifications.</P>
<P>The emperor has but nine sea-ports in his whole domin|ions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Sancta Cruz, Safy, Sallee, Mammora, Larache, Ar|zilla and Tangier, on the African ocean; Zaffarina, and Tetu|an, on the Mediterranean; though Tetuan is two leagues within land. To begin in order as they are named; Sancta Cruz (or the holy cross) is the first port to the southward. The town is about a mile in length, and a quarter broad. The chief merchants are Jews, who trade with England and Holland. Their vent is hides, dates, copper, and bees-wax.</P>
<P>Safy, or Sophia, appears next, a town situate on a bill; but drives a larger trade than Sancta Cruz.</P>
<P>Sallee, situated thirty-five leagues south-west of Cape Spartel. It is divided into two towns, the old and the new; it is called by the natives, Arbat. There is a very good harbour, and a strong castle well stored with guns, if the Moors knew
<PB N="91" REF="046409_0089_102145465EBA60F8">
how to make use of them. The town is large and well in|habited, but the walls are all demolished. I observed the ruins of a church, the steeple yet standing, a noble fine Gothic building. The chief trade of this town consists in the prizes that are brought in by their gallies.</P>
<P>About seven leagues more to the north stands Mammora, once possessed by the Spaniards. It stands in a bottom, sur|rounded with mountains, which renders the air very unwhole|some, by reason of the excessive heat; but the bay is fine, large, and secure from all winds. This town is generally the high road to Mequinez, the present capital of Morocco.</P>
<P>The next port northward is Larache, a town of a plea|sant situation, and strongly fortified; but, to the eternal in|famy of the Spaniards, delivered up to Ismael, after a siege of five moons; two thousand soldiers and a hundred officers be|ing taken prisoners: a sufficient force to have defended it against the whole powers of Muiley Ismael, for they neither wanted provisions nor ammunition. But we shall leave them and their cowardice, and go on to</P>
<P>Arzillah, or Azillath, about twelve leagues more north. A place only famed for tobacco, which they seldom trade abroad for, having sufficient: vent for it among the natives of Morocco; and as we have but little business with it, we'll come to</P>
<P>Tangier, (as fast as we can) a fine, large, well fortified city, when in the hands of the English; but since they have left it, and razed the fortifications, the Moors have thought fit to repair it.</P>
<P>The next, Zaffarina, is a place of very little note, and therefore we shall make no observation concerning it.</P>
<P>The last is Tetuan, a town six miles within land, without any fortification. The inhabitants came originally from the province of Andalusia in Spain, as indeed did most of the Moors on the sea coast of Africa. They are white men, pretty well civilized, very kind to strangers and Christians, and pay but little regard to the emperor of Morocco.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="046409_0090_10215E9BF0EFF440">
As to the nature of the inhabitants, they are most of a tawny complexion, of a lazy, idle disposition, and cursed with all the vices of mankind, mistrustful to the last degree, false, jealous, and the very picture of ignorance. They stile them|selves Mussulme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, or true believers, yet their word is not to be relied on upon any occasion. The Moors are generally but indifferent soldiers, and but seldom brave. They are of|ten famed in the Spanish histories for men of gallantry, but I could never find them inclined that way. They manage a horse, it must be confessed, with a great deal of dexterity. They abominate the Christians, (for the very word signifies in their language, dog) and are continually seeking means to destroy them. Mahomet has taught them in his Alcoran, that all of his faith who die fighting against the Christians, immediately enter into Paradise in triumph: nay, even their horses, if they die in battle, are immediately translated into heaven; for they hope to have the pleasure of riding there as well as on earth.</P>
<P>Though polygamy is allowed, yet they must marry but four wives, and must settle a dowry upon them; and if ever they put them away, they must return their dowry along with them: But they may keep as many concubines as they think fit; though they have this privilege, when they can please them no longer, they sell them to the best bidd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; so that the women of Morocco, in my opinion, have but a sad time on't: Yet the husband is obliged to keep all their children. They esteem ideots and naturals to be saints, if they are men; for they believe the women have no fouls, and are only formed for propagation. They will not allow them to enter their mosques, because they esteem them incapable of being received into heaven; yet they say their prayers at home, and on Friday resort to the places of burial, to weep over the graves of their deceased friends, clothed in blue, which is their mourn|ing. They hire professed mourners to grieve and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at the graves of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tions, and howl over them, as I have seen the Irish; asking them why they would die, when they were provided with every thing that was necessary in this world. Their time is spent in eating, drinking, sleeping, dallying with their women, horses, and prayers, (for they never learn to read, and are forbid gaming:) and even their prayers are hurried over as slothfully, as if they were asleep.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="046409_0091_10215E9E696D2210">
They have usually a string of beads in their hands, like the Roman Catholicks; and to every bead they have a short prayer, which, as they repeat, they drop through their fin|gers. The prayer consists only in the different attributes of God, as, "God is great, God is good, God is infinite, God is merciful." The emperor of these wretches only differs from his subjects in a larger propensity to their ill qualities, with the addition of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> degree of cruelty and avarice. I was told that during his twenty years reign, he had murdered with his own hands twenty-three thousand men: Nay, I am apt to believe the truth of it, for he put forty-seven to death in the one and twenty days we were at his court.</P>
<P>Every nation is amazed to find his subjects so submissive and patient under so excessive and cruel a tyranny: But they should understand, (bating their want of power) that they are taught to believe, if they fill by the hand of a king, who is Xerif, (which signifies Mahomet's successor) they immedi|ately go up to heaven; and if there is any that would not willingly be sent to heaven before their time, they are sure to fly from him when he is clothed in yellow, which is his co|lour of murder; and he generally dyes it of a blood-colour before he goes to sleep.</P>
<P>As I was viewing some new buildings one day, near the king's palace, I perceived him giving directions to some of the workmen. There were several carts drove by his slaves with materials for his buildings, and as they passed him, he bastinadoed some for going too fast, while others, thinking to mend that fault, were drubbed by him for going too slow. One poor creature, trembling for fear of what would follow, went bowing before his cart; but the emperor wounding the horse in the flank he gave a spring, tumbled the wretch down, and drove over him. Another following him, ran to assist his fellow, but the emperor threw his dart, and struck him in the shoulder. The slave drew it out, and upon his knees, presented it to him again, which the emperor (when the man had got some distance from him) darted into his chine. The fool drew it out once more, and covered with blood, gave it to him back again; but as he was stooping, he fell down with loss of blood at the barbarian's feet, who did him the favour to pin him to the earth through his back.</P>

I was so shocked at the sight, that I could not recover myself for a good while afterwards.

The king's palace is indeed a very large place, almost four miles round, including his gardens; but is very ill contrived. Here you shall see a fine pillar added to support an old r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inated place, and yet he employs most of his time in building. In short, it looks like gold-lace on a hop-sack.</P>
<P>His stables are the most regular buildings in all his palace. But that's no wonder, for the Moors even reverence horses; and one that has been a pilgrimage to Mecca, has as much veneration as the pilgrim himself. The king had one of these horses, which I have seen always finely comparisoned, and a slave to attend, who carried a pot and cloth to keep him clean. All the horses that are thus sanctified are usually freed from all manner of service, and if the owner cannot afford to keep it, which often happens, there is a pension settled upon them by the Mufti.</P>
<P>The Jews drive a great trade here, but they pay sufficiently for that privilege; for they are obliged to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r black caps, that they may be distinguished; and notwithstanding their great trade, they are but s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vily used; for if a child insults them, it is as much as their lives are worth to resist.</P>
<P>The women of Morocco, I mean all that I had the for|tune to see, were very handsome&punc; fine large full eyes, round faces, and every feature exact. They are very amorous, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">extrous in contriving methods to satisfy their desires.</P>
<P>A gentleman of our retinue told me, he had got an in|trigue one of the Moorish women, daughter to a governor of a province; and his manner of going to the appointment was in a disguise. She sent him by a French slave of her's a complete woman's dress&punc; which are generally all alike; and their faces are all muffled up to their eyes, so that they are often m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t by their own husbands in the street, without be|ing known; by this dress he got admittance as a lady com|ing to pay a visit, and then they are very secure. For it is the custom, whenever a man, even the husband, finds a pair of women's sandals, at the door of his wife's chamber,
<PB N="96" REF="046409_0094_10215EA6788C9BB8">
he must retire; for it is the greatest affront they can put on a woman, to enter her apartment when they have that warning to the contrary. He told me she was a delicious creature, and mistress of the whole art of love. It is no wonder if they give themselves up to love, when perhaps there are twenty or more, (according to the capacity of the per|son that keeps them) shares in one single man; and they must be contented to stay for due benevolence, till their ty|rant pleases to send for them.</P>
<P>The habit of the men is generally white, (which is a co|lour they extremely delight in) with a red cap on their heads; that is, the married men: for all the youth, from the prince to the beggar, before wedlock, go uncovered. They are close shaved under their caps, except one lock upon the crown of their head, which they never cut off; being they are taught, by that lock, Mahomet is to draw them up to their imagi|nary Paradise. They only shave under their chins, but suf|fer their beards and mustachoes to grow, which they take a particular pride in the length and largeness of; and he that's well bearded, must be a wise man.</P>
<P>Their shirts are made like shifts, only the sleeves are so long that they hang down over their hands. Under the shirt they wear linnen drawers, that reach down to their knees, for their legs are always bare; their shoes are made with|out heels, like Irish brogues. Over the shirt is a vest with|out sleeves, which they surround with a silk scarf, of what colour they please (except green, which is a colour sacred to Mahomet, their emperor, and the clergy;) in this they thrust short daggers, or knives. Over all is a garment, which they call a Haick, about five <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lls long, and four broad, which they wrap round them as we do our cloaks. Some of the meaner sort, especially in the country, wear straw hats of their own make. Their dresses are all alike, only some add a gold or silver fringe round the border.</P>
<P>As for religion, they rise early and late to prayers; but only (like children) do it because they are ordered. Their Mufti, or head of their religion, is reckoned the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">st in the empire, and di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">owns, the emperor's authority; but he finds means to fleece him, as well as the rest of his subjects, who obey him out of fear; for if there was one person found to

love him, it would be as strange a sight as one of their monsters.</P>
<P>I could not forbear smiling to see the providence of the Moors. Walking one day about a mile from Mequinez, it began to rain prodigiously: I got under a tree to shelter myself from the tempest. But I observed several of the na|tives undress themselves with a great deal of precipitation, make up their cloaths in a bundle, and sit on them stark naked; and all their care was to keep them surely from the wet, leaving their naked bodies exposed to the fury of the storm. When it ceased, they walked a little way till their bodies were dry, and then dressed themselves. If a man was to do so in England, he would be counted a madman or a fool, yet I must own I thought them in the right; for, be the storm ever so violent, yet when it is over, they pur|sue their journey with dry cloaths on their backs. But they have one conveniency, they are drest and undrest in half a minute. Nay, I am informed those that travel on camels, or on horseback, have a conveniency covered with an oiled cloth, in which they thrust their cloaths on the like occa|sion, and ride naked. I fancy, to meet an army in a storm would create a terrible fright, and do as much execution to an ignorant body, as their offensive arms, and force them to seek for safety in their heels.</P>
<P>The emperor is able to raise an hundred thousand horse, and fifty thousand foot. When they are to make war among themselves, they go very unwillingly into the field; but when they oppose the Christians, they do it with a great deal of chearfulness; because they expect indulgences for the expi|ation of their sins. When they are ready to give battle, they range their armies after this manner. They divide their ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">se into two bodies, and place one at each wing; the foot is in the middle, so that the whole forms a crescent or half-moon. Before they begin the battle, they give a great shout, then make a short prayer, and fall on without much order very furiously; so that they soon overcome, or are as soon put to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ight. Break but their foremost ranks, and you put their whole body into confusion.</P>
<P>I have said before, that no person is rich but the empe|ror; neither do they take the methods to be so; or if they are, their greatest wisdom will be to conceal it; for if once known, they are sure to lose all their wealth.</P>

No foreign coin is current in Morocco, except Spanish pieces of eight, which are only received by weight. But the Jews will secretly take any coin, and I suppose dispose of it again with the same circumspection they receive it. They have but three sorts of coin current amongst them. First, a ducat of Barbary gold. Second, a Blanquile of silver. And last, a Felowze of copper, The image of the emperor is not al|lowed to be put on their money, being expressly forbid by Mahomet in his Alcoran; but they stamp them with Ara|bian characters. Their way of reckoning is by the ounce.</P>
<P>These are the heads of what I observed in my small stay among them. The ambassador informed me, he was in some fear that his embassy would not succeed; for he said, he found little else but delays, excuses, and nothing of sinceri|ty among them. We were informed, that the emperor de|signed to go speedily upon an expedition against the Moors of the province of Oran, who had newly revolted, and put to death their governor for his avarice, he having extorted from them vast sums of money; and the inhabitants after his death, chose one out of their own province to command them. This hastened our ambassador in his legation, to get an answer one way or other. But we were informed the king designed to set out the next day upon his expedition, and yet the ambassador had not his audience of leave. This made him and us very uneasy; for we could not stir from Mequinez, without the emperor's express leave. But about seven in the evening, the ambassador had orders to come and take his last audience, which was the ninth of June 1693. We went in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> manner as we did at first. But we were informed by our interpreter, that the king was in a very ill humour, and that he had but an hour before killed two of his chief blacks&punc; by stabling them with a dagger h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> con|tinually wore at his girdle.</P>
<P>We entered the palace farther than at the first time, where we waited a full half hour. At lad, the emperor approached richly drest, and finely mounted on a white Barbary; the saddle and other accoutrements wrought with gold and pre|cious stones in several places. He was this day in his vel|low or fatal vast, and sprinkled in many places with the blood or those h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> had stain; and I thought his countenance had
<PB N="99" REF="046409_0097_10215EAE83405620">
something more of horror in it than at our first audience. He had a spear in his hand, set round with pearls on the top, and a cap with ostriches' feathers waving in the wind. All his attendants had fled his presence, at the notice of hav|ing on his yellow vest; and he had only a dozen of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> guards waiting upon him trembling, but the Alcaydes and other great men crept about us during our audience.</P>
<P>The emperor began with his old compliment of, "You'r welcome," but his looks and words I thought did but ill agree. The ambassador used many arguments with him to bring h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> embassy to a happy issue, but to no purpose.&mdash;The ambas|sador told me, the king was a person that had not the leaf regard to his word, and even disowned a letter he had writ|ten to his master the king of France. Therefore, said he we will take our leave of this country of monsters in two days: for the king had signed his departure, with all his retinue.</P>
<P>I was very well pleased with this resolution; for now I should once more see that treasure of my soul, whose ab|sence had robbed me of all joy. I even thought these two days the longest of my life; but at last they were past and we set out merrily; at least I did, and all the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the retinue. Though I must own, I could not answer for the ambassador, for I believe the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll success of his em|bassy had a little chagrined him. I did my utmost to en|deavour to divert his melancholy upon the road, which he took very kindly. We lay in tents the first night, which the ambassador had taken care to provide us, and provision likewise; for there is never an inn between Mequinez and Mammora.</P>
<P>We rose the next day very early, that we might avoid the heat of the sun. When we came within a league of the town, we saw coming towards us our Italian, and by the melancholy in his looks, I began to tremble with ap|prehension of some accident. As soon as he approached u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, after paying his obeisance to the ambassador, he addressed him|self to me. Said he, (in French)&punc;</P>
<P>I wish some one else would have taken my commission upon them, for what I have to tell you will cut you to

the heart. The various troubles in my breast locked up my tongue, so that I had not power to ask him any questions. In short, said he, your mistress is forced away from us, through the treachery of Mustapha. At hearing this fatal news, I dropped senseless from my camel, nor came I to myself till we arrived at Mammora. I was a thousand times going to destroy myself, and I believe I had done it in the height of my despair, if I had not been with-held, In short, the ambassador was no longer ignorant of my cruel loss; for in my ravings, I had called her my dear wife. He seemed ama|zed at the discovery, and reproached me in a handsome man|ner, for not trusting him with the secret. I was not in a condition to beg his pardon, neither was there any one could give me comfort. I was carried on board, where I enqui|red in what manner she was taken away.</P>
<P>The captain informed us, that Mustapha had made his es|cape out of the cabin-window, by swimming. I did not tell any one of it, said the captain, because I thought it would be to no purpose; for I imagined there could be no other ill consequence to attend his escape, but merely the loss of him. He had been gone three days, when on the fourth, there came on board us the governor of Mammora, the fu|gitive Mustapha, and one hundred soldiers, who immediately seized on the young gentleman, who they said was a woman, and wife to a renegado of Sallee. It was in vain to op|pose him, especially when I found by her breasts, that she was really a woman. They took her on shore, notwithstand|ing her cries, shrieks, and lamentation, which pierced our very hearts. They put her on board a Saick, and set sail im|mediately, steering south, as we suppose, for the port of Sal|lee. This gentleman (meaning the Italian) took it upon him to acquaint you with the unhappy accident; but, added he, I believe it is not impossible to regain her. The ambassa|dor was so good as to offer his assistance in what lay in his power. I begged he would be pleased to lend me a boat with some hands to work her. He very willingly granted my request; and told me he would lend me the ship, but he feared it might occasion a more publick quarrel.</P>
<P>He lent me ten hands for pateraros, and sufficient small arms, with every thing that was necessary. My kind Ital|ian would accompany me, and the rest of the company went
<PB N="101" REF="046409_0099_10215EB2929E0978">
voluntarily. We spent but little time in setting out, and the wind proving favourable, we set sail, and made very good way. The Saick had not pursued her voyage above five hours before us, so that we had hopes of getting up with them. I encouraged my companions, who laboured incessantly. We sailed and rowed all night, and when the morning dawned, we gained sight of a vessel; which we did not doubt was that we sought for. We laboured hard to come up with her, and gained upon her every moment. Before eight o'clock we came along side of her, and I soon discovered Musta|pha giving orders about the engagement. I drew out a pair of pistols, and shot him dead. The rest fired upon us, but notwithstanding all their opposition, I jumped into their ves|sel, followed by the Italian and five more of the men; and though they were superior in number, yet we soon made them ask for quarter. I upon the instant enquired for her that was always in my thoughts; but to my great grief, was in|formed by an English slave at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar, that she was taken on board of a galley by Captain Hamet our Irish renegado; and they assured me it was impossible for them to be over|taken Unspeakable was the sorrow I felt at this relation; and all the satisfaction I felt, was, that I had rewarded Mus|tapha for his treachery. We steered our course back, but I was more dead than alive in the voyage.</P>
<P>When we came on board, the ambassador condoled with me for my misfortune, and entreated me to take comfort. I told him death was now my only comfort, and I hoped that it was not far off.</P>
<P>Our Italian had agreed for his passage on board a vessel in the bay bound for Rome: He begged that I would ac|company him into Italy: and when he had settled his af|fairs, he would (if it lay in his power) come back to Sal|lee, and do his endeavour to find what was become of Miss Villars. I thanked him for his offer, and told him I would accept of it. I had effects enough, having all the money and jewels we brought from Hamet's country-house. We took leave of the amba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ador, and gave him abundance of thanks for his civilities, and went on board the vessel that waited for us: we set sail immediately, and in two months safely arrived at Rome; where our Italian did not care to go pub|lickly
<PB N="102" REF="046409_0100_10215EB694AE7AB8">
on shore, but stayed till the darkness of the night fa|voured our landing.</P>
<P>We had all our goods disembarked, and took a private lodg|ing in an obscure part of the city, where we were sure of being concealed. We asked our landlord, (who was a French-man) about the news of the place. He told us a great deal of idle stuff, which signified nothing to us; at last, by the advice of the Italian, I enquired of him, if Hernando Alvares was in town or not? He answered me, that he had been dead above two months, and had left a noble estate behind him. I asked him if he had not left a wife to possess it. No, said he.</P>
<P>About three years ago, (continued our landlord) he was to have been married to a beautiful young lady, an heiress to a vast fortune; but his brother stept in between, and gained her affection. Some say they were married, and oth|ers not; but she was delivered of a fine boy. Don Her|nando took a barbarous revenge of his brother, as it is re|ported: he bribed a captain of a vessel to put a weight about his neck, and drown him in the sea. But to make amends for his inhuman act, he has left his vast estate to the son his brother had by the lady, and has chosen his ho|liness the Pope for his guardian. Pray, said I, what's be|come of the young lady? He answered me, he could not tell; but it was supposed she was gone into a nunnery.</P>
<P>The Italian, while our discourse lasted, turned his face to the window, that we might not perceive the disorder of his countenance. As soon as our landlord was gone, he turned to me, and embraced me; said he, My dear friend, let what will happen to me, I shall have it in my power to serve you with my fortune; and so much I think myself obli|ged to you, that if half will buy your mistress's liberty, you shall command it. I returned him the acknowledgement his kind proffer deserved, but told him, I could not expect to be so happy. He bid me not despair. I begged he would not mention any thing of my affairs, till his own came to a lucky issue.</P>
<P>The next day, we procured ourselves habits after the mode
<PB REF="046409_0101_10215EB8222691A8">
of Rome, and resolved to go to Grimaldi's country-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hear, if it were possible, some tidings of Isabella.</P>
<P>Antonio had drest himself in a mean habit, and appeared as my servant. It being but six pleasant miles, we had re|solved to walk it. We entered a village within half a mile of the place, and resolved to dine at a poor inn, there to gain some intelligence. I went for a French merchant, and Don Antonio passed (as I said) for my servant and inter|preter, and informed me of the discourse that passed between them. That gentleman (meaning me), says he to our host, has some business to communicate to Don Antonio Grimaldi, (for we knew of his being there.) Our innkeeper told us, it would be a difficult matter to talk to him about business now, for he was that very evening going to set out with his daughter, in order to put her&punc; into a nunnery at Na|ples; for all his persuasions, added he, cannot prevail up|on her, but she is fixt unalterable in her resolution. This news, you may be sure, hastened our departure; but we did not well know how to disclose the secret we had to unfold.</P>
<P>Don Antonio, as not doubting Isabella's affection to him, was fearful lest an abrupt discovery should have some strange effect upon her. We therefore resolved, that I should first appear, and break the matter by degrees: for he had in|formed me that she spoke French very well. When we approached the house, Antonio stood at some distance, while I went up to the door alone. The porter and I not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|derstanding one another, I had like to have returned as wise as I came. But at last a servant in the family&punc; happening to understand French, came and ended our sputtering at one another, I informed him I had a secret of the greatest im|portance to declare to Donna Isabella. He told me he would acquaint his lord with it. The servant went in, and im|mediately returned with a grave old gentleman that seemed to have been weeping. He asked me in French, what I had to say to his daughter, for she did not care to speak to any one. I begged that I might be brought to her pre|sence, and did not doubt but I had something to say to her which would&punc; not displease her. Don Antonio Grimaldi gravely smiled and shook his head: No, no, Sir, said he, you have nothing to give either her or me comfort, unless you could
<PB N="104" REF="046409_0102_10215EB9E1773AF0">
revive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he dead. I answered him, he did no know what I could do. But I told him the longer he delayed my see|ing her, the longer he deferred their own happiness. Well, said he, I have no hopes; but you shall see my daugh|ter, to convince you that nothing in this world can make us happy.</P>
<P>He led <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> through several stately apartments, all hung with black. And though it was high noon, yet the sun's light was excluded&punc; and dim twinkling lamps usurped his room. At last, we entered a chamber, where sat the fair forlorn. I stopped a moment to behold her, and notwithstanding a fixt melancholy on her countenance, beauty triumphed there. She was caressing an infant she had in her arms. The fa|ther entered first, and told her in French, that a gentleman of France had a secret to communicate to her, that would banish her melancholy. The gentleman (replied the lady,) may promise impossibilities, but rather than expose him, I would beg him not to open his mouth upon that subject. Madam, said I, I own myself a physician, but I pretend to cure the mind, as well as the body; and to acquaint you with what you know already, you mourn the loss of a gen|tleman, that you imagine was drowned at sea: But I can assure you he escaped that danger, and is now a captive in Barbary, pining under the severest want; and all the hope he has of freedom, is through your means.</P>
<P>The lady upon this, looked wistfully upon her father, and said, Dear father, don't endeavour to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me any longer; you know I have your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ne is cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">red.

and heavenly powers, I have seen him within these two months, and what I have related to you, his own mouth in|formed me; and having gained my liberty, I made him a promise to see his friends in Italy, and inform them of his condition. The transports and exstasies that took possession of both their souls cannot be expressed by words. They em|braced me, kissed me, and called me their preserver. Un|looked-for happiness! said Isabella, Heaven, thou hast heard my prayers! and does my dear Antonio live! I'll imme|diately embark for Barbary, and fetch him thence myself: Even all that I am worth, my precious boy shall sell his fortune too, to redeem his father. O my young Antonio, Heaven has restored thy father from the dead, said she to her child, and I hope we shall see him again. The pretty innocent mingled his tears of joy with theirs. After their first transports were over, they again embraced me, and beg|ged I would put them in a way to pay me the obligations they owed me. Then they proceeded to enquire which way they must go about to accomplish his liberty. I told them I had a servant waiting without, that I intended should ac|company the persons they would send to manage the affair. They seemed to reproach me for letting him wait without, and were immediately sending for him in. I begged they would give me leave to go for him myself, seeing he was a foreigner, and they would find it a hard matter to make him understand them. Upon this I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">an out, and called to Antonio, and told him in a few words how things stood. He followed me close at the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ls: I went into the room first, and as Antonio Grimaldi was giving him his hand to lead him in&punc; he fell upon his knees before him. Isabella cast|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> eyes upon him, gave a shrink, and cried out, 'Tis he, his he himself, my dear Antonio! joy took away her speech&punc; and she fell down into a trance. He ran and caught her in his arms, kissed and embraced her; and at last brought her to herself. Imagination must make up the discourse be|tween them. He told her at last, when words of sense took place, that he was obliged to me for his liberty; for he had sent several letters to his sisters, but&punc; never could get any answer. They informed him that both his sisters were gone to reside at Veni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e with their husbands&punc; and that was the rea|son their letters never came to their hands. Now, said An+tonio, if my friend (meaning me) was but happy, it would complete my joy. But to find a wife, a son, and father
<PB N="106" REF="046409_0104_10215EBFE3412580">
kind, when I had many reasons to think the contrary, must have some alloy, or it would not be possible for me to bear it.</P>
<P>Antonio upon this, related my unhappy story, and they all lamented my hard fortune. He afterwards enquired of his dear Isabella concerning her own sufferings; which she rea|dily began.</P>
<P>Said she, That day you left me, the troubles of my mind wrought so much upon my body, that the physicians declared I was in a violent fever, and advised my father to send me into the country, which he accordingly did the next day. The thoughts of being so far from my dear Antonio increas|ed my malady, and my father had little hopes of my life. My fever, after having brought me to the brink of the grave, left me: and my father imagining it was the approaching marriage that had wrought this sudden illness, told me one day, that if it was that which lay so heavy upon my spirits, he would remove it, by giving me power of refusing to be the wife of Hernando Alvares. I thanked him, and told him he had taken the only way to restore my health; and that if I was forced to wed him, I should be for ever miserable. He was the tenderest of fathers, and informed me he would never force my inclinations. The kindness my father shewed me, worked so much upon me, that I began to recover.</P>
<P>Your brother used often to visit me in my illness, which retarded my health. My father seeing it would never be in my power to love him, very frankly told him so, and beg|ged that he would discontinue his visits; for he was resol|ved his daughter should never give her hand, where it was not in her power to give her heart. They parted with ma|ny words between them, but my father persisted in his resolution.</P>
<P>I began to discover that I was with child, and a new sort of illness seized me. I knew this was an accident that could not long be concealed, therefore I resolved to let you know my condition; and I gained my woman, by several promi|ses of reward, to deliver a letter to you: But she betrayed me to your brother, which I suspected from her not appear|ing. I therefore declared the truth to my indulgent father. He was very much enraged at the discovery, but paternal love prevailed over his passion; he forgave me, and promi|sed
<PB N="107" REF="046409_0105_10215EC24A8EF508">
to make me happy with my dear Antonio. These prom|ises made my sickness vanish, and I had no other disease but what attends breeding women. My father went to Rome to enquire after Don Antonio, but could not get the least in|formation of him. This gave me a new shock. But what bitter agonies did I feel, when I received a letter from your brother, (with a copy of that I had written to you, inclosed&punc;) which was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>UNGRATEFUL woman! Yet I will no more upbraid thee, but let thy crime be thy punishment. He that betrayed me I will not call by the name of brother: He has paid for his ingratitude with his life. I only give thee this notice, that thou mayest feel some of those pangs that thou hast thrust into the breast of</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>HERNANDO ALVARES.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The reading of this letter sunk me down, and I called for death, as my last and only hope. I resolved to refuse all food, and had starved myself to death, if a good priest had not convinced me by his arguments that my soul was in dan|ger; that I should be guilty of a double murder, myself and and an infant. I lingered on in a restless state of unhappiness, till the time of my delivery came, which I prayed to heaven to end with my life; but it pleased the Almighty Power to spare me to be happy.</P>
<P>The sight of my precious infant called to mind the loss of his father; but I resolved to banish all thoughts of death, that I might take care of his tender years. But I begged my father to give me leave to go into a nunnery. With much importunity he granted my request, on this condition, that if I continued in that mind at the end of two years, I might do as I thought fit. Though I thought the time an age, yet I unwillingly consented.</P>
<P>My father used means with the Pope, to have your broth|er called to an account for your death, and it had gone hard with him, if we could have procured any witnesses; but for want of them he was acquitted. In a little time, a heavy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eep melancholy seized him; and he professed so sincere a
<PB N="108" REF="046409_0106_10215EC3F3BC3788">
repentance, that even I almost forgave him. He begged he might see the child; which my father made me comply with. He shed such abundance of tears over it, that my father wept for company: and he spoke so tenderly of the loss of his brother, that it wiped off all suspicions of his repentance. Since thou hast loft a father, said he, through my barbarity, it is but just that I should prove a father to thee. He fre|quently came to see him, though I could never be prevailed upon to accept of a visit. At last his grief seized him so violently, that he was given over by his physicians. When he was upon his death-bed, he made his will, and bequeathed my little Antonio his whole estate, leaving the Pope his guar|dian. He died full of repentance for his crime, and no doubt his soul took its flight to heaven.</P>
<P>The generous Antonio could not refuse some tears to the memory of his repentant brother; but joy succeeded sorrow. The Pope was acquainted with the story, who sent to con|gratulate their happy meeting. Nothing but mirth and plea|sure ran through the villa, which encreased my sorrow.</P>
<P>Don Antonio told me one day, that he did not think be had a right to rejoice without me; and now, said he, I have nothing to afflict me but what you feel, therefore I will bend my thoughts if it be possible, to relieve your grief. I can procure a friar of my acquaintance to go to Sallee, one that knows the nature of the business we shall send him about, seeing he has often gone to redeem captives. We'll send for him, and you may give him what instructions you think fit. I thanked him, and was very sorry for the trou|ble I should give him, but was resolved to accompany him myself. He told me he would not have me go by any means, for I could be of no manner of use in the affair, but rather a hinderance; and if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> should be once discovered, might fall into the same state we both lately escaped from; and perhaps meet with much worse usage than I had before. His advice was so reasonable&punc; that I resolved to take it, whatever violence I did myself. The friar was sent for, had his com|mission and instructions given him; and withal to spare no cost, Antonio told him, whatever he gave should not be thought unreasonable.</P>
<P>He was to have a thousand crowns for his expences, and two thousand more if he succeded.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="046409_0107_10215EC76C8FA378">
The friar undertook his voyage with a great deal of alac|rity, and gave us great hopes of his success by his willing|ness; and he embarked the next day for Genoa, that port being the properest place to get a vessel for Barbary. We wished him a good voyage, and recommended him to fortune.</P>
<P>Don Antonio did all he could to divert my melancholy: We often went a hunting, shooting, fishing, and visiting the ladies. In short, he made me partake in all the diversions Italy could afford. But though I seemed often to be di|verted, yet I had always my condition too much at heart to be merry. We viewed all the rarities and antiquities of an|cient and modern Rome. I must confess these amusements lulled my sorrows often, but when I had time for reflect|ing, they rushed upon me with the greater force.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble my reader in describing places treated on by pens far above my weak capacity: but only give a short description of Naples, whither Don Antonio would have me go. I was not much averse to the journey, though a pretty long one; and we sat out with a very handsome equi|page. Donna Isabella, with her little son, accompanied us: but Don Antonio Grimaldi was obliged to attend the Pope, to settle the affairs of his son-in-law's estate. I was obli|ged to appear cheerful, if it was but in complaisance to Don Antonio.</P>
<P>We arrived at Naples in three days, without meeting any thing extraordinary upon the road. Certainly, never any city in the world can boast a finer situation: add to that, their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">addings are sumptuous, every private house seems a palace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> every palace looks like the court of a king: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from tempest: strong both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.

<P><PB N="110" REF="046409_0108_10215ECAB1EC22D8">
This is not only a safeguard to the city and adjacent coun|try, but might prove its scourge. In 1587 it was blown up, by lightning penetrating to the powder-room, which mightily damaged the whole city. The second is Castello Neuvo, or the New Castle, built by Charles, king of Naples. This cas|tle commands the haven, and is generally the viceroy's dwell|ing. The third stands on the south-east corner of the city, built upon a little rock joined to the continent, by Lucul|lus the Roman, and is sometimes called by his name, but oftener Castello del Ovo, or the Castle of the Egg, from its form. They have also a fine arsenal for their gallies, very well kept, and furnished with great store of ammuni|tion. But I think the Mole the most extraordinary piece of work, seeing it defends the haven from the stormy south: lined on each side, and paved on the top with noble square stones, and in the middle a sine large fountain of marble; the whole extent is five hundred paces, and ten in breadth. The inhabitants often boast of the antiquity of their city, found|ed twenty years after Troy's destruction, and called by the ancient poets Parthenope, which Virgil doth sufficiently tes|tify in his Georgics:
<Q><L><HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lo Virgilium me tempore dul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is alebat</HI></L>

<P>This city has suffered many revolutions, but none more ex|traordinary than that in 1640, when a poor fisherman, with|out shoes to his feet, in five days time, commanded the whole power of Naples; and might have lived in that grandeur, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f his mind had changed with his exalted state; but he was still a fisherman. His short-lived fire blazed too fierce to last, and he fell a victim to the rage he himself began.</P>
<P>Their churches are noble structures, and beautified with paint|ings by the best hands. Their women are most of them beautiful, but my heart had no room to think of them.</P>
<P>The city is governed by very wholesome laws. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> one in par|ticular adds much to the quiet of it; none are suffered to wear swords but those of the garrisons; so if there's any rencounter in the str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ts, a boat at fifty cuffs generally ends the dispute: Though bravoes are to be hired to do a mur|der
<PB N="111" REF="046409_0109_10215ECC4049A390">
here as cheap as at Rome, and men of honour too; for we heard of a quarrel between two Neapolitan gentle|men, where one, according to custom, hired a bravo to mur|der the other, and gave him his reward before-hand. But it so fell out, that some friends to both parties reconciled the two gentlemen. The person that had bargained with the bravo for the job, sent to him, and told him of their recon|cilement, but that he might keep the money. The other told him that it was not in his power to return it to him, but he was above receiving money without doing his work, and therefore the gentleman must of necessity suffer death. He intreated him, and used many arguments, but all to no purpose. When he found nothing would prevail, he told him he would immediately acquaint the gentleman with his design, which he did accordingly. Notwithstanding, the bravo the same evening found his opportunity, and lest the other gentleman for dead upon the Mole; though he recovered after a lingering illness. But the bravo had the impudence to go to the other, (when he found the gentleman was in a fair way of recovery) and told him he begged his par|don that he had not been as good as his word, but he would take care and mend his hand very quickly. In short, he was found so resolute in the matter, that the gentleman was obliged to hire another of the same trade to give him a cast of his office, and dispatch the bravo before he could execute what was designed; and the next day he was found dead at the very door of the gentleman's house he had intended to assassinate, waiting, as it was supposed for an opportunity to do his business.</P>
<P>After we had viewed every thing within the city, we went to see the much famed Vesuvius, or the burning mountain, a league and a half east of the city. The Neapolitans call it the bed-chamber of the sun, because it appears to them first from the top of that mountain. Round the bottom of it is the richest spot of ground in the universe, I'll not ex|cept even the mines of Potosi; for the yearly vintage pro|duces twelve hundred thousand ducats. The middle of the hill is very pleasantly shaded with chesnut, and several other fruit-trees. The mountain has a double top; that to the north terminates in a plain finely cultivated. The other to|wards the south, which is the Volcano, rises much higher.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="046409_0110_10215ECDCCE03038">
When we had gained the summit, we descended gradually into its bowels, by large steps cut out on purpose. It has, in times past, done much damage to the country round it, by its sudden eruptions; but now it forebodes nothing but rain, when the top is enveloped with clouds.</P>
<P>When we had sufficiently satisfied our curiosities at Naples, we took a tour to Putzol or Posuolo, through a hollow rock, a mile in length, and no other light but what came in at both ends, and one in the middle from the top of the rock. This subterraneous passage is paved with stone all through, and the narrowest part of it is ten yards over. About the middle is a small chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary. We visited all the rarities of the place, particularly Virgil's tomb, which is almost covered with ivy. They told me of a lau|rel-tree that sprouted naturally out of it, but (not to take from that incomparable man, whose works are ever-living lau|rels) I could not see any such thing. We also viewed the Lake Agnio, so called from the multitude of serpents or snakes that fall into it from the pendent mountains. The water is of two different qualities; that tasted from the surface is sweet or fresh, but that taken deeper is of a brackish taste, sup|posed from some minerals that environ it.</P>
<P>On the south side of the lake stands a natural stove, which is called St. German's Stove: but we had not curiosity enough to enter it, nor faith enough to believe a ridiculous fable that is told concerning it, (though it is reported a saint de|clared it for a truth) which I shall put down here, and leave my reader to judge of it himself. St. German was advi|sed to repair to this stove, to cure him of a dangerous mal|ady. When he came there he found the soul of a very pious man that he knew, tormented with the heat of the place. St. German, (as understanding the language of souls) asked him, how so good a man as he was in his life-time, came to be condemned to such a severe punishment. The soul very civilly answered him, that it was for siding with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aurentius, who opposed Symmachus in the popedom; but he was convinced that his prayers would fetch him out of that hot house. St. German prayed heartily, you may be sure, and got the soul of the man out from thence; but where it went after, no one could tell. But the place was called ever after, St. German's Stove.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="046409_0111_10215ED0A7F36EA8">
To the east of the bordering mountain is a place they call the Cave of Death; for whatever thing of life ventures into the farther end, they say immediately drops down dead; though a person that lived in a neighbouring village ventured in of|ten for a reward. When he came out again, he was all of a sweat, and hardly able to stand for five or six minutes. When he had recovered himself, he took a dog out of a bag he had brought with him, and by the means of a wooden instrument made for that purpose, thrust him in to the very end, and drew him out dead to all appearance. When he had remained some time for us to view him, he took him up by the fore-legs, and threw him into the Lake Agnio, where he recovered immediately, swam out, and ran away from us. Don Antonio told me it was a hard mat|ter to get a dog there; for as soon as ever they saw a stranger, they would run away into the woods, and sneak home again when they were gone; which was the reason the person that went in, always secures one for that occasion.</P>
<P>A mile farther, we went to the court of Vulcan; a place unpleasant enough, continually smoking, and such hot vapours arise from the pores of the earth, that it almost overcame me. In some places water bubbles out of the cavities; and if we threw a stone into it, it rebounded back as if you had struck it against a pavement. But the place is reck|oned to cure a great many distempers; especially to make women pregnant, and to cure diseases of the head and eyes. Donna Isabella was carried over it in a sedan; but I believe she did not want it upon the score of barrenness, as you may understand in her story.</P>
<P>We spent six weeks in this not unpleasing entertainment, and Don Antonio being pretty well satiated as well as my|self, we went back again to Rome.</P>
<P>And now my melancholy gained such ground upon me, that it was not in the power of dissimulation to hide it. Don Antonio and all the family expressed a great deal of trou|ble for my sorrow; and I am well assured there was not any thing in their power they would have refused, to have given me quiet: but the mind's disease baffles the physician's art. At last a letter arrived from the friar, which gave us no other account, but that he was safe returned to Genoa,
<PB N="114" REF="046409_0112_10215ED4DB95CC50">
and intended to embark for Rome in a few days. This lame account quite disheartened me, for now we had not the least hope, seeing we all agreed if he had succeeded he would have been forward enough to have acquainted us with it. The knowledge of this cast me quite down, and my body was for|ced to submit to the troubles of my mind. A strong fe|ver seized me, and brought me to the brink of the grave: and though I wished for death, yet, like common friends, he fled from me in my necessity.</P>
<P>Don Antonio and his lady seldom went from my bed-side, and had I been a brother to them they could not have re|garded me more. But nature, in spite of my misfor|tunes, prevailed, and I gathered strength even against my will. They had informed me in my illness (by my importunity) of the friar's arrival, and that he had not succeeded in his negociation: but yet they had not told me all the particu|lars. I desired the friar might be sent for, and conceal noth|ing from me of what had passed. Accordingly he came, aud gave me the following relation:</P>
<P>Sir, said he, (in French,) as soon as I arrived at Sallee, I met with Hamet the Irish renegado. He received me at first after a brutish manner, but when I declared I came to pay him his demand for one of his slaves who made his escape, he began to be less sour in his treatment. He said a great many handsome things concerning Don Antonio; but when I began to mention you, he fell into a violent rage, and vented bitter reproaches against you; saying, you were a vile impostor, had basely deceived and robbed him doubly, of his mistress and his money. I told him I came to ransom the lady, and pay for whatever damages you had done. As for the lady, said he, she's food for the fishes long ago; for rather than she would submit to me, she threw herself overboard, (before we had gained the port, when I had ta|ken her out of a Saick, which one of my slaves had brought her in from Mammora) and, in spite of our endeavours to the contrary, sunk for ever to the bottom. [And is she gone? said I: O proof of virtuous love! happy had I been to have embraced the same fate!</P>
<P>The relation of this killing disaster took away my senses
<PB N="115" REF="046409_0113_10215ED6660A3C48">
for some time; but when I had recovered, he went on.]</P>
<P>I had some hope at first this was only a fiction of his own; but I found in the town, that it was no secret, and every body declared that it was truth. A Jew confirmed me in it, whom you had bought several things of for your voy|age. He told me that Hamet arrived without any woman with him, for he saw him land in a very ill humour, and had complained of him for assisting you, to his superior at Mequinez, and he received a sufficient check from him. I was too well convinced of the truth, and therefore hastened my departure, and I am very sorry I could not succeed; but that it was in fate, and I hope you will calmly submit to the will of Heaven, who sends these afflictions for trials.</P>
<P>The good friar gave me a great many wholesome admo|nitions; but I was not in a state much to observe them. I now began to be careless of the world, because there was nothing in it (since the death of my dear wife) worthy my notice. I had no thoughts of returning to England, though I had opportunities enough; but took a resolution of going to some remote part of the world; imagining, the farther I was from my native country, I should be the farther re|moved from my anxiety. But alas! sorrow is too constant a companion, and there's no parting with it, but by death.</P>
<P>I begged Don Antonio, if he heard of any ship bound for a long voyage, he would acquaint me with it, which he promised me to do, (after finding persuasion had no effect on me.) Two months passed away, and no news of a ship; when I began to be very uneasy, and told Antonio, I would even make a voyage to Genoa, where I could not well fail of a vessel. When he found nothing could stay me, he asked me to what part of the world I would chuse to go? I told him I did not much care where. Why then, said he, if you please, my father and I will sit you out a ship of what burden you think fit, either for war or traffic. I thanked him, and told him I would have it for both, if he pleased, and I would be their supercargo, if they thought fit to give me so great a trust. In short, a ship of two hun|dred and fifty tons was bought of an English merchant at Naples: a new flout vessel that mounted six and twenty brass guns, and we manned her with a hundred hands, most Eng|lish;
<PB N="116" REF="046409_0114_10215ED8C2078FD0">
who, understanding I intended for the South Sea, were glad of the opportunity. Don Antonio took care to provide every thing necessary for traffic: and I was made captain, and supercargo. I told him I hoped I should in a few years bring him a good account of his lading. He obligingly an|swered me, that he hoped I would come home reconciled to myself, and he should think himself very happy. The worst of it was, we had no commission, neither would I suffer An|tonio to procure me one; for we resolved, like Englishmen, to fight only with the enemies of our country.</P>
<P>I christened my ship the Isabella, out of respect to An|tonio's lady, and hoisted English colours on board. When the day came I was to go on board, there were tears shed on both sides. I could not, without some regret, part with so good a friend as Antonio had proved to me; and I am very well convinced that they were as sincere in their sorrow.</P>
<P>We sat sail from Ostia, (where our ship lay ever since she came from Naples) the second of March 1693, with in|tention to steer our nearest course for America. Our ship proved an excellent sailer; and we made the Straits' mouth in twelve days from our first departure. When I beheld the coast of Africa, it brought fresh to my memory past tran|sactions; and I longed for an opportunity to be revenged on the Moors. The next day our men discovered two sail bear|ing down the wind upon us. We thought ourselves too well provided to run away, though we kept on our course; and perceiving but one of them that followed us, I asked my men if they were willing to speak with that vessel, and they cried one and all, they would with all their hearts. We prepa|red for an engagement with all the expedition imaginable, for fear she might prove of Barbary. We hoisted our Eng|lish colours, and they did the same. When we found that, we lay by, that we might be informed of the news in Eng|land. But as soon as ever they came along side of us, they plucked down their English colours and hoisted those of Mo|rocco in their room; calling to us to surrender that instant or it should be worse for us. We were a little surprised at first in being disappointed; but, notwithstanding this, my men desired I would begin the fight. We had not opened our po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts yet, and I ordered my men not to do it till I gave them the word. I sent a man to busy himself about
<PB N="117" REF="046409_0115_10215EDC087ACAA8">
the halliards of our ancient, that the rover might imagine we were going to strike. We were well provided with small arms, and all manner of warlike stores. I ordered every man to their posts, and not to appear till they heard a whistle; upon which they should open their ports, and fire both great guns and small arms. The rover thought us long in stri|king our colours; he therefore called out to us again, and told us if we did not strike that instant, they would pour a broad-side into us. Just upon that, I blew my whistle; my men obeyed my orders punctually, they burst open our ports, thrust out their guns, and gave them a broad-side, with a discharge of their small arms. This put them in much confusion, as not expecting any opposition; and I am cer|tain we killed a great many of their men; for, imagining we should be their prize without fighting, they had crowded upon deck all their hands.</P>
<P>I had tacked about and given her another salute before they returned us the favour. But they were not long backward, but poured in upon us very fast. My men did their business very well, and the fight continued half an hour with the ut|most fury. I began to fancy we should have but dry meat, (as the sailors say) and looking upon their quarter-deck, I soon espied the renegado Hamet giving directions. At the sight of him I was both surprised and pleased; but my soul was filled with an unusual fury. We were so near, that I could hear every word he said, though I could not understand him, because he spoke in the Moorish tongue. As we were tack|ing about and charging again, I shewed myself to him: I told him he was the only man in the world that I hated; and that very day he should be in my power, or death should put an end to both our lives. He seemed surprised, but gave me a great deal of abusive language. I encouraged my men, and desired them to fight bravely, telling them if we fell into their hands, we should have no mercy. I had fired my piece at random before, that is, at the first person I saw; but now I levelled all at Hamet, and he the same at me. At last I had the good fortune to fetch him down. At this sight I could not forbear giving a shout for joy, which so af|fected those that were near me and understood the business, that they fought like so many furies; and after an obstinate fight of two hours, they struck to us. We gave God thanks for our victory; and I immediately went on board them,
<PB N="118" REF="046409_0116_10215EDD93A53490">
where we had made a terrible slaughter, they having lost, by their own account, ninety-seven men.</P>
<P>I asked some of them, what ship that was which stood aloof from the engagement; and they informed me it was a prize they had taken a few days before, laden with wine and other commodities. I then thought of a stratagem to get her into my power. I ordered our ship to strike her colours, and then we hoisted those of the Moors, and took our&punc; ship in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow. When the prize saw us in that posture, she imagined the Moors had conquered, and made all the sail she could to come up with us; so that we soon came near enough to send a long-boat armed on board her.</P>
<P>There were but twelve Moors on board, besides prisoners that were put under hatches. When our men had taken care of them, I went to them, and ordered the prisoners to be re|leased, desiring the person that was the master to come upon deck. The Moors had not taken any of the lading out of her. She was a sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p of ninety tons, bound for Liverpool, laden, as I said before, with port wines, and several jars of oil. I told the master he was at liberty to pursue his voyage when he thought fit. The poor man was some time before he could believe what I said to be real: But when he was convin|ced, he returned me the thanks suitable to the present I had made him. Yet he would make me a present of a couple of hogsheads of wine, two jars of oil, and two of raisins; be|side six of each to the ship's crew.</P>
<P>I had lost seventeen of my men in the engagement, and eleven wounded; which I supplied, by taking as many of the slaves they had on board of Hamet's ship, all by their own choice; and the rest that did not care for so long a voy|age, I recommended to the master of the prize, who promi|sed me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and them all in England.</P>
<P>We pillaged the corsair, and found very good booty. We had out of her to the value of two thousand pounds in goods&punc; which I entered in the ship's books for the use of the com|pany. We did not know well how to dispose of her crew; and though they deserved death, yet in cold blood I thought it was inhuman; and I considered they had never injured me. So I released them by the consent of the whole com|pany,
<PB N="119" REF="046409_0117_10215EDFFA545F80">
with this agreement, that they should make a present from me to Mirza the eunuch of fifty pounds in their Moor|ish money, which he that had command over the rest, swore by Mahomet to perform. When we had taken every thing that was needful for our voyage out of her, we let her go, and pursued our course.</P>
<P>We touched at the Canaries (or fortunate islands) to take in fresh water, and turned the lading we had taken out of the corsair into money: and I shared it among the sailors, reserving a fourth part for myself and owners, as I called them. I gave the men, by lots, leave to go ashore, where they soon disposed of their money for things they wanted; but the chief of their commerce was for wine and brandy, knowing we had a long voyage to make.</P>
<P>We were obliged to leave the town sooner than we de|signed, by reason our pilot had unfortunately killed a Portu|guese, and the governor threatened to have our ship stopped, if we did not surrender him up. I understood that the de|ceased had been in the wrong, and therefore rather than run the hazard of loosing him, we sat sail from thence the tenth of April. The castle fired several guns with shot to stay us, but we did not regard it, but kept on our voyage.</P>
<P>We met with nothing worth our notice, till we made the island of St. Vincent&punc; one of the Cape Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ds, and came to an anchor in ten fathom water, in a fine gravelly bottom.</P>
<P>These islands are the Hesperides of the ancients. The na|tives are blacks, a poor miserable people. They brought us a few tortoise, which we exchanged any trash for, and they were contented. The rivulet of fresh water would hardly supply us, it being almost dried up; but we had wood enough. The whole island is not above two leagues and a half in length, and half a one in breadth; very barren of fruit, grass or roots, and even animals. I saw only a few wild asses, and some goats, which were too nimble for us, or so far off that they were not worth our wasting powder and shot.</P>
<P>The island of St. Anthony, about two leagues to the north, is a well inhabited island, belonging to the crown of Portu|gal.
<PB N="120" REF="046409_0118_10215EE1ABA416B0">
We resolved to go and anchor there; but the wind proving fair, we pursued our voyage, passed by the island de Fogo in the night, and we could perceive the Volcano, burn|ing like the flame of a glass-house. Twenty days afterwards, we passed the Equinoctial Line, with the usual ceremony of ducking all those persons that had never been there before: But I bought off the best part of the delinquents for an anchor of brandy.</P>
<P>The next day, we buried two of our men, who died of the wounds they had received in the fight; but all the rest happily recovered. We gave them three guns, and commit|ted them to the waves.</P>
<P>In the latitude of twenty-two, we saw a great number of fowls, and therefore judged we could not be many leagues from land, which we discovered soon after to be the island of Ascension, about two leagues to the north; but we passed by it, and in two days more, anchored in six fathom water at the island of St. Catherine's, about half a mile from the main land of Brazil.</P>
<P>This island lies in twenty-seven degrees thirty minutes of south latitude. It is almost a continual grove of trees, and but thinly inhabited by Portuguese, and a few blacks. They are in want almost of all the necessaries of life, besides pro|vision, which is plentiful enough, such as it is. The inhab|itants are courteous enough, and would not take money for any thing we had of them, but linen and woolen. And af|ter I had got every thing that was necessary for the ship, I sold them goods to the value of four hundred pounds, which I received in pure gold. They never have peace with the Indians of the continent; and being so very near, they have often formerly made inroads, and carried off the inhabitants. But they have prevented such attempts for the future, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ilding several redoubts, where they keep constant guard.</P>
<P>They pay no other taxes but the church tithes, which they'll he sure not to lose; and for religion they had but one friar when I was there, and all his business was, as I was in|formed, only to receive his tenths.</P>
<P>A Frenchman told me a pleasant story of one of the in|habitants,
<PB N="121" REF="046409_0119_10215EE40EFEC2A8">
an industrious fellow that had ten children; but notwithstanding his industry, found it a hard matter to bring both ends together at the year's end: though the worst of his grievances was the priest's tithes, and his money. He often endeavoured to persuade the father to forget him a year or two, but all to no purpose.</P>
<P>One day the father paid him a visit, in order to receive his dues. The poor man told him ingenuously he had it not in his power to give it to him. But still he insisted. At last he told him he had but one way to procure it, and that he feared the church would not allow of. The friar told him him he was the best judge of that, if he would tell him what it was. Why, said the man, a person that lives on the continent has several fat pigs, of a very fine breed. Now, said he, I could bring one over with me unperceived of any one, as I come from my daily labour; and such a one (na|ming a neighbour) will give me a good price for it. The friar paused some time&punc; but at last gave him this answer. It is certainly a sin to steal, but yet it is a greater sin to rob the church of its due, and therefore I will absolve you. But bring the pig to me, for if it is worth so much to your neigh|bour, it is worth as much to me. The man told him he would be sure to bring it to him that night; and the friar said, if he was not at home, he would leave word with his servant to take care of it. Now the friar had no constant dwelling here; for they are sent from Lagoa, a town upon the continent, about ten leagues to S. S. W. and their tithes were usualy sent there in a small bark kept for that pur|pose. The priest took care to be out of the way (that he might swear he knew nothing of the matter, if it was found out) at the time when the man was to come with his pig; but gave his servant a strict order, that whatever was brought should be immediately carried on board, and taken a great deal of care of&punc;</P>
<P>When the time came, the man was as good as his word, and brought to the priest's house his promise in a ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">sket. The servant obeyed his master's orders, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to carry it on board; but before be could get to the harbour, what he had in his basket began to cry our. The poor fel|low was very much frightened to find he had got a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the basket; but fearing, by the charge his master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="122" REF="046409_0120_10215EE825957D90">
of it, he was deeply concerned in the affair, made all the haste he could on board: and the vessel setting sail that night, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e went with his charge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Lagoa, where he very secretly delivered it to the brotherhood.</P>
<P>The priest at St. Catharine's thought his man had robbed him, and made his escape, seeing he was missing so long; for he had carried a great many other things on board be|fore the child. The imagination of this made the father very uneasy; and the wind continuing fair, he embarked on board a vessel, and arrived at Lagoa the day after his man. But what was his surprise, when he found he had got a suck|ing child, instead of a sucking pig! He told the rest of his brethren the affront that had been put upon him; and they resolved to send the bantling back again: but either for want of due care, or through the fatigue of the sea, the child died. When the friar came back to St. Catharine's, he ran open-mouthed to the poor man, and swore he should be excommunicated for playing such tricks with the church. The man told him he was forward enough to have his tithes; so having ten children, and finding nine too many to keep, he was resolved he should have his due, and have the tenth. And farther added, if he offered to make any more stir about it, he would acquaint every body with his encouraging him to steal from his neighbours.</P>
<P>The father finding the man had too much understanding to be priest-ridden, thought it his best way to hold his tongue. But the secret was disclosed, and the poor priest led a sad fort of life: for whenever he came for his tithes, many would merrily ask him if he would have his tithe pig. In short, the friar was shamed out of the island, and the fra|ternity were obliged to send another man in his room, who very often hears the story of the child, though much against his will.</P>
<P>We anchored first within a bow shot of the island of Par|rots, in seven fathom water&punc; but we were informed the best place to water our ship, was two leagues beyond the island of St. Catharine's. We had our present wants supplied from the continent, though no enough to water the ship; so we resolved to steer for the watering place in the bay of Arazatiba.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="046409_0121_10215EE9B016F578">
We steered between the island and the continent, and all the way on each side we discovered a beautiful prospect of houses&punc; environed with natural woods and groves, which gave the eye a vast delight. When we approached the bay of Arazatiba, we perceived a ship, with English colours, with her anchor a peak, in order to discover who we were. I immediately hoisted English colours, but prepared for an en|gagement, as imagining her to be French, (or some English pirate;) for there was war between the two nations; but I found it was a privateer commanded by Captain Dampier, who made me a visit, after having hailed us. When he was on board, he used many persuasions to engage me to con|sort with him, and follow the business of privateering; but I told him I had other affairs to manage. After I had treated him handsomely with what the ship afforded, he took his leave, and invited me to dine on board his vessel the next day. I gave him my promise to wait on him, and I accordingly went, where I was very handsomely treated; and there we agreed two days after to make an entertain|ment jointly for the officers of both ships on shore; and the day after that for the rest of the crews.</P>
<P>In order to this, I commanded a large tent to be pitch|ed, capable of holding fifty persons; and we strove who should send the most materials on shore for our feast. We had the musick of both vessels; but mine proving to be the best; as being Italian, gave the most delight: not but they join|ed in consort, and agreed very well.</P>
<P>After dinner, Captain Dampier told me, though he could not oblige me with Italian music, yet he had an English eu|nuch that sang admirably; he added, he could not answer for his judgment, but he was very well convinced he never heard a finer voice in his life. The person was brought in; but my readers may guess at my surprise, when, in the person of the singer, I discovered my mistress's lawyer, whom my master and his friend had equipt for a fine singer&punc; I knew him as soon as ever I saw him, but I perceived by his behaviour he had no knowledge of me; neither was it very possible be could have known me; because he had never seen me but once, and then he had too much concern to make any observations; but the occasion had imprinted in my mind a lively idea of him.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="046409_0122_10215EEB40A70DA0">
He sung admirably well, and with good judgment. I asked the captain how he came to be an eunuch; he told me he could not inform me, neither could the ever prevail upon him to let him know it. We were very merry for several hours; and I may safely declare, that during that time I had buried my inward malady.</P>
<P>I told the singer, I believed I could let Captain Dampier into the secret of his castration, if he would not be offended at it. He seemed very much concerned, and blushed; but imagining I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w nothing of the matter, he gave me his consent to say what I thought fit; yet with the utmost cha|grin in his face, as believing he was only to be the jest of the company.</P>
<P>But when I began to name my master, and entered into some part of the story, I found him in the utmost confu|sion, insomuch that I pitied him, and told him I would not proceed any farther without his consent. He told me in bad French, (for he had observed that the captain and I some|times talked to one another in that language) that I was very welcome to tell his unfortunate story, but not to so many au|ditors; for, added he, I perceive you know it very well. I gave him my word only to tell the captain, for which he thanked me; but I told him in return, that he must let me into the rest of the story; which he promised to do. The captain and I, with my quondam lawyer, took an opportu|nity of leaving the company, and walking a little way up the river side, where I informed him that I came to the knowledge of his story, by the porter that dogged him, (for I did not think it convenient to let him know that I was a person concerned) and that seeing him go into the coach in Lombard-street, I remembered his face again. He gave us his story in the following manner:</P>
<P>I was bred up to the law by my father, an attorney of Lincoln's Inn&punc; who, dying, left me a small estate, which I soon spent in none of the best of company. I had no thoughts of business, till drove to it through the utmost ne|cessity. But finding want approaching, I began to open my eyes, I took chambers in Clifford's Inn, and resolved to stick to business. I soon found clients enough through the credit
<PB N="125" REF="046409_0123_10215EEDC60F9320">
of my father; and understanding the rough as well as&punc; the smooth part of the law, I got money enough to supply even any extravagance. I had ever been a great admirer of the female sex, and had the good fortune, or rather the ill, to succeed in most of my amours.</P>
<P>The first time I ever saw the fatal cause of my misfor|tune, was at St. Dunstan's church; (which, to my shame I must own, I too often frequented without devotion.) Our eyes often told us the language of the heart. I got the op|portunity of sitting in the next pew to her, but had never once disclosed my passion.</P>
<P>One Sunday, as the clerk had set the Psalm, she begged I would lend her my book; saying, she had left hers at home. When she had done, she returned it to me, and thanked me. I had resolved with myself to have waited on her out of the church, but was prevented by the person that was afterwards her husband. When I came home, I pulled my prayer-book out of my pocket, but perceived it would not shut as usual, which put me on examining it. I found a note pinned to the last leaf, which I had not observed before; the contents were to invite me to an assignation that evening at six.</P>
<P>I was very punctual, and found her there before me. I begged her pardon for making her wait, which she easily granted with a gentle reproach; and we soon came to a right understanding; for that very night, before we parted, I had what I wished; the sweet which was followed by&punc; the worst of bitters.</P>
<P>She told me she had long had a passion for me: which, though she resisted all she could, got the better of her mod|esty, and forced her to declare it. She informed me too, that she was speedily to be married to the man that led her out of the church, though it was much against her incli|nation: but she was obliged to comply with her mother's commands.</P>
<P>We had many meetings: sometimes at my chambers, till I was taken too much notice of by some of my neighbours: and when she was married we often met at different places,
<PB N="126" REF="046409_0124_10214544CF980120">
and she as often made me handsome presents.&mdash;[He then re|lated now he was discovered at my master's house by one of the apprentices, (meaning me; but as he concealed his face by turning it to the window, he could not remember him.) He also related all that I have declared in the former sheets; and added, that when the operation was over, his mistress (as knowing him of no farther use to her) left him without speaking a word.]</P>
<P>When I had recovered strength, said he, to write, I sent for some of my intimate friends, and among the rest a sur|geon. I told him my misfortune, and was examined by him; but I was obliged to stay at the inn several days. At last (though almost a miracle) I was perfectly cured, and returned to my business; but my story getting air, I was made the scoff of every body that saw me; till in short my life became a burden to me, and I took a resolution to go to some part of the world, where no one should know me; and getting acquainted with Captain Dampier, he fa|voured me so far as to enter me steward. I had learnt to sing when I was young; and my voice growing clear by my loss, is much improved. I had kept my misfortune a secret to all the crew, if I had not received a wound in my thigh, by an Indian arrow on the coast of Florida, a year ago; for the surgeon coming to dress me, when the extreme anguish had taken away my senses, perceived my condition, and disclosed it to the company: but I have the good fortune not to be flouted at.</P>
<P>When the story was finished, we joined our company again, and ended the day in mirth and jollity. The next day my crew went on shore to regale themselves; for Captain Dam|pier and I had altered our resolution of sending both com|panies together, for fear of quarrels and disorder. And his crew went on shore the following day.</P>
<P>About noon, as I was reading in my cabin, I heard the report of several pieces; upon which I ran out, and went myself to the top-mast head where I perceived my men, who were filling our casks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> river of Parrots, surrounded by a multitude of Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> upon the instant, let slip our cables, and having a strong sea-breeze, steered full into the river's mouth at all hazards, ordering every man to his arms,
<PB N="127" REF="046409_0125_10215EF0DBAD6748">
and to load all our great guns with musket-ball. By good fortune, the tide was almost at the highest, so that we came on broad-side the rivulet where our men were defending them|selves. They had made a rampart with the empty casks, and had kept off the Indians with their pieces; but just as we came, they had spent all their ammunition, and had re|solved to submit to the Indians. But as soon as they per|ceived us, they took to their heels and ran towards our ship, and the Indians after them; but we soon stopped their ca|reer, by firing our double and round, which killed them fifty&punc; men, and put the rest to flight. We took our men on board, and intended to fall out of the river, but found the tide turned; and before we could get out, our ship ran aground, so that we were obliged to wait till the next tide. I was very uneasy at this accident, and ordered my lieutenant to take the boat, and acquaint Captain Dampier with it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, not to be idle, I armed twenty men, and ordered them to guard the rest while they filled our casks; which was accordingly done, and with the long-boat brought on board. I would not let them be hoisted into the ship, for fear of hurting her now she lay aground; though it pro|ved to be a clayey bottom.</P>
<P>An hour before night we perceived an Indian running very swiftly to us, who called to us in Portuguese to fetch him on board. As soon as he was in the ship, he told a man that understood Portuguese, that the Indians, to the number of a thousand, designed in the middle of the night to at|tack our ship, and that they would come down in canoes; for they very well knew we could not get out till tide of flood.</P>
<P>This man, whom we took for an Indian, was a Portuguese the Indians had taken prisoner a year before, and understand|ing their language, learnt their resolution; and while they were calling their number together, he took his opportunity to make his escape. I ordered him to be told he should be rewarded for his intelligence. I immediately called all the officers together to consult about the danger, and we agreed to send to Captain Dampier for help, who came with fifty men well armed: and, by his advice, as soon as it was dark, we landed six of our cannon, and raised a small battery without any noise or bustle; these were pointed up
<PB N="128" REF="046409_0126_10215EF3661ECA00">
the river slanting. Two of our guns were loaded with dou|ble and round, in the stern of our ship. The rest of our men were ordered in close coverts, on each side of the river, with directions to let the Indian canoes pass them, and not to fire till they were gone by.</P>
<P>Every thing was concerted and settled, and every man or|dered to his post, to expect the charge; and we had con|trived it so well, that none of our fires could hurt one another.</P>
<P>About one o'clock in the morning we could hear their paddles in the water, and soon after perceive them silently falling down the river, to the number of two hundred ca|noes. We let them come within fifty yards of our ship be|fore we fired; but, when we began, we made such a ter|rible slaughter among them, that I pitied them. We took one canoe with twelve Indians, and their Chief among them. When the morning dawned, we were amazed to see what havock death had made; the very shores were stained with blood, and we had not lost one man of either of our crews.</P>
<P>The Portuguese, who gave us notice, I rewarded with a hun|dred pounds, and two new suits of cloaths, both of linen and woollen; and we made use of him for our interpreter. He told us we had one of their Caciques, among the pris|oners, and a man of great power among the Indians. I or|dered him to ask him the reason of his enmity to us, since we had never offended them. He told him that he took us for Spaniards or Portuguese, nations they hated from the barbarous usage they had met with from them: but he was sorry he had molefied us, seeing he was convinced we were Englishmen, and enemies to the Spaniards as well as them|selves: But however, he would pay sufficiently for his ran|som, if we would spare his life; and accordingly we agreed for an hundred weight of gold dust, and twenty in ingots, and he ordered one of his retinue to fetch it. In the mean time, we took the advantage of the tide, and fell down to our old station.</P>
<P>The next day at noon, two canoes arrived, one with the gold, and several persons of quality, that came to wait on their king; and the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with fruits and provisions, which I equally parted between both ships companies. I
<PB N="129" REF="046409_0127_10215EF5BB2407A8">
took the ingots for sharers, and the dust was divided among us, according to our allowance. Captain Dampier and his crew were mightily pleased with their dividend, and once more pressed me to accompany them: But I gave them a flat denial for the present, with this hope, that when I had visited several places in the South Sea, I would return to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Salvador, and wait two months for them there.</P>
<P>We put the Indians on shore, and the next day weighed anchor again, saluting Captain Dampier with eleven guns, who returned us the like number, and we steered our course with a fresh gale, for the streights of Magellan. I intended to pass through those streights into the South Sea; for I was of opin|ion it would shorten that voyage; and then my curiosity strengthened that opinion; but I was advised by my lieu|tenant to venture up to Buenos Ayres, a town belonging to the Spaniards, where he assured me we might drive a good trade underhand with the merchants. I communicated the matter to the whole company, who unanimously agreed it was the best course we could steer. So we kept in with the shore, and steered for the Rio de la Plata, or the River of Plate, which we reached in twenty days without any accident. As we had was with France and Spain, I had hoisted French colours, that we might have the liberty to trade with more safety.</P>
<P>Buenos Ayres is situated about fifty leagues up the River of Plate, which above the town receives the name of Para|guay; and takes its rise many leagues up the country; which a possessed by a numerous nation of Indians, who sometimes trade with the Spaniards, but oftener murder them when they can meet them conveniently; for the spirit of revenge is sucked in with their milk, and handed down from father to son; so that they imagine it be a very meritorious died to dispatch one of them; and they are generally rewarded by their Cacique for it.</P>
<P>The town of Buenos Ayres takes its name from the ex|cellent temperature of the climate, and its pleasant situation. They have commerce with the ships of Europe not above once a year, which bring them the necessaries they want, and in return ease them of their gold; that being a metal less esteemed than iron, which proves more useful to them. When we were within two leagues of the port, we came to
<PB N="130" REF="046409_0128_10215EF8811EB670">
an anchor in a little creek in eight fathom water, and a sandy bottom. We did not care to go nearer the town, for fear the governor should have taken it in his head to have hin|dered our going out again.</P>
<P>Though we were not in sight of it, yet we had canoes on board of us in an hour after our anchoring; and some of note came incognito, to be informed of what we dealt in. One of them told me, he believed it would be no difficult thing to dispose of my cargo, if I thought fit to make the governor a small present. Accordingly I took his advice, and sent my steward in my name, with a piece of holland, and half a dozen pieces of Italian silks; which he received as a very valuable present, and sent me word he would not in the least molest me, provided I did not deal too barefa|ced. I understood him, and therefore was very cautious, sell|ing but to one at a time, nor would I suffer another to enter my ship till the former was dispatched.</P>
<P>In two days I got rid of all the cargo that I intended to part with, to a very great advantage; and then I allowed my men liberty to do what they thought fit with what they had, which gave them a general satisfaction.</P>
<P>The next day I invited the governor on board, with some of the principal merchants, and entertained them in my cab|in; and in return, I was to dine on shore at the castle. But I left a strict order with my lieutenant how to behave himself if I should be stopped; for I knew the Spaniards to be a very unfaithful people.</P>
<P>When we landed, I observed the town made but a mean appearance, consisting only of two streets, built in the form of a cross, and surrounded with a mud wall. The castle itself made but an indifferent figure: but however, I was el|egantly entertained. The governor seemed to have less of the formality of the Spaniard than ever I met with in any of them. When I took my leave of him, he made me a present of two Indian slaves and a bar of gold that weighed three pounds two ounces. When I came on board, I called a council, to know what course we should steer next, for as to traffic, I had no pretence to go to the South Sea, seeing all my cargo was already disposed of. We debated for some
<PB N="131" REF="046409_0129_10215EFBC86838C0">
time, and at last we all agreed to go to the South Sea, upon the score of privateering. We communicated our intentions to the company, and they all seemed very much rejoiced at the resolution I had taken.</P>
<P>Now I began to repent I had not joined with Captain Dam|pier, for I wanted men for my notable exploit; but I did not despair of meeting with him in the South Sea. We weighed anchor, and steered for the streights of Magellan, with a fair wind. One morning my servant waked me, and told me that a sail bore down upon us, and the lieutenant desired to know how to behave himself. I rose upon the instant, and, by the help of my perspective, saw it was a ves|sel with English colours; but I imagined they were put up only for a show. I caused French colours to be hoisted. Which was soon answered by the same in the ship that pur|sued us. I ordered every thing to be prepared for an en|gagement, without any hurry, commanded my men not to appear upon deck, and kept on my course with crowded sail, that our pursuers might imagine I was willing to get from them; yet I ordered it so by false steering, that they gained upon us. About three in the afternoon, they were within half a league of us, firing every quarter of an hour a gun to leeward, to let us know we were to take them for friends.</P>
<P>I ordered our men to tack about, to hoist up English co|lours, and bear upon them. We soon perceived we had much surprised them; but notwithstanding, they kept up their French colours, and seemed to prepare for the engagement, though they were much inferior to us. When we came along side, I hailed them, and (after their owning they were French) commanded them to surrender; but was answered with a broadside, which we returned so fast, that they soon struck, and called for quarter. I ordered the captain to come on board, who informed me that his vessel was called the Felicity, belonging to Monsieur de Gennes, and had been separated from the fleet three days before. I used the cap|tain very handsomely, for the sake of Monsieur St. Olon, the French ambassador. I gave him a latter and a small pres|ent for that gentleman, and dismissed him without taking any thing from them. I found this action did not please some of my men; and not caring to have them uneasy, I sum|moned them upon the deck, and told them the obligations
<PB N="132" REF="046409_0130_10215EFD51585690">
I had to the French ambassador; acquainting them, as it was a ship of war, there was not much to be expected from them, therefore I told them I would share five hundred pounds among them to make them amends for their disappointment. But not one of them would accept a penny; and in return, I told them I did not intend to make any more such com|pliments to the French, if ever they came into my power again. They were very well pleased at my declaration, and some of them praised my generosity; for though most sailors are rough and blunt in speech, yet they can in their way admire a generous action as well as other men.</P>
<P>Our officers were under some apprehensions of meeting with the squadron of Monsieur de Gennes, which, being a fleet of five sail, would certainly be too hard for us; and we were informed by the captain of the Felicity that they were sailed for the streights of Magellan. I found their fears very rea|sonable, and it would be a fool-hardy action to encounter a force so much superior; for though life was burdensome enough to me, yet humanity obliged me not to hazard the lives of so many men that were not out of love with this world. So I resolved to wave my curiosity, and make for Le Maire's streights; which in five days time we discovered, known to sailors by three rocks, called the Three Brothers, from their likeness to one another.</P>
<P>We found a strong current setting northward, and an un|usual tossing of the ship; but we got through the streights in two days with safety, and made for the South Sea.</P>
<P>The next day, we discovered the Magellan clouds so well known to sailors, which convinced us that we were over against those streights that run into the South Sea. These clouds are always seen in the same degree, and the same or|bicular form. We kept our course, not intending to come within sight of the continent for fear of a discovery; and the weather favoured us, it continuing very hazy.</P>
<P>About an hour within night we heard the sound of a trum|pet, which we conjectured must be on board of some ves|sel, because we were well assured we were not near enough to the land; upon which I immediately gave orders to put our all our lights, and steer our course that way we heard
<PB N="133" REF="046409_0131_10215EFEF8B522B8">
the sound; which, founding often, gave us true notice of their course; and in half an hour, though pretty dark, we gained sight of them: but their mirth was soon changed when we got up with them, thrust out our guns and hailed them. We understood they were Spanish, and I ordered them to be told, if they did not upon the instant ly by, and send their commander on board, I would immediately fire upon them. They very readily complied with my orders, hoisted out their boat, and the captain came on board me, whose name was Don Juan Villegro, and his ship the Wild-fire: he was employed by the viceroy of Peru to carry condem|ned persons to Baldivia, which is the residence of most of the rogues of America. But we were also informed they had the Real Situado on board, which is a sum of money so called, that is sent from the vicoroy of Peru to pay and clothe the garrison, as well as to repair the fortifications of Baldivia. This sum usually amounted to four hundred thou|sand crowns, but we could find no more than two hundred and fifty thousand: but then, to make amends for the defi|ciency, we met with a great many valuable East-India goods, brought from thence by their Manilla ship; for the mer|chants always put their supply to Baldivia in the ship that carries the money to pay the garrison, that being the only time to dispose of their goods.</P>
<P>This prize made my men mad with joy, and I feared it would make them think they should have enough, and con|sequently desire to return home. But I soon found it had the contrary effect, and they all expected, from this earnest of good fortune, riches enough in the voyage we proposed, to make them for ever happy.</P>
<P>I treated the prisoners handsomely, which were forty-six, including sixteen felons, who were well pleased to have changed their masters; expecting better usage from us than from the Spaniards of Baldivia, where they were designed. There was one Roberts, an Englishman, among them, who, I have been informed, has been executed since for piracy: I entered him, two Frenchmen, four Spaniards, and the trum|peter, in my books to reinforce my crew; understanding their crime was only suspicion of piracy, therefore I was convin|ced they were good sailors. But I did not know how to dispose of the ship and the rest of the crew. If I should
<PB N="134" REF="046409_0132_10215F016A3B95A0">
give them their liberty, they would of course alarm the coun|try; and if I kept them with me, provisions would fall short; for they were victualled but for a month's voyage.</P>
<P>The Spanish captain being informed of my fears, told me, by an interpreter, that he had received such handsome usage from me, that he would upon his honour steer to what port I thought fit, and report, if I pleased, that I was sailed back again for the North Sea. I told him, though I could rely upon his honour, he could not answer for all the rest. At last I thought of a stratagem to deceive the Spanish captain, as well as the other prisoners, as follows: In the first watch of the night (the prisoners being all under hatches,) I came to our sailors upon deck, and told them the ill consequence of keeping or letting go the prisoners; and therefore con|certed with them that they should pretend a mutiny the next day, and all declare for going back through the streights into the North Sea. When the first watch was relieved, I ac|quainted the other moiety of the company, and then retired to rest. But my slumbers were broken with visions of my dear Miss Villars: I dreamt I saw her in the arms of the renegado Hamet, struggling and calling out on me for help, but before I could come to her assistance, death had freed her from the barbarous wretch. This dream had brought to my mind all my afflictions, and I can't tell how long I should have continued feeding upon my sighs, if I had not been alarmed with shouts and noises upon deck. I ran out to see what was the matter, and found my men, as was de|signed, in their feigned mutiny. I had forgot at first, and was much alarmed; but recollecting, I carried on the cheat. And grief had so seated herself on my countenance, with the thoughts of my dream, that out of my quarter-masters told me afterwards, my looks were enough to deceive all the world.</P>
<P>The Spaniards had leave to be upon deck all the day, and care was taken to let them into the secret. At dinner I told the Spanish captain (for he and the merchants always eat with me) that I thought his speeches yesterday were prophetic, for I was compelled to comply with my obstinate crew, and sail for the North Sea again. He replied, he wished me happy wherever I went: and to carry on the deceit, we steered our course back again.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="046409_0133_10215F04979389A8">
In the afternoon Roberts came to me, and told me that one of the Spaniards, who was willing to stay with us, would undertake to bring me ten thousand pieces of eight in ten days, if I would let him have the prize. Upon what Rob|erts said, I sent for the man, and had him examined by Rob|erts, who understood Spanish very well; the Spaniard told me, he would not have me enquire into the secret till it was done; and for the better security; I might send who I thought fit with him, provided he had one of his com|panions that was to help in the design. Accordingly, I or|dered twenty hands, and to obey the Spaniard in this expe|dition, as if he was their captain.</P>
<P>We agreed to wait for them the limited time, in the same degree we parted from them. I informed the Spanish cap|tain, by an interpreter, that his countryman was gone upon some secret expedition, and as soon as he returned we would pursue our course. He answered, whatever he had under|taken, he was of the opinion he would succeed in it, for he had certainly as much cunning as any person in the world; he had been condemned to Baldivia once before, and made his escape from thence; and he did not doubt but he would get from them again, if he had been carried there the sec|ond time; and farther gave me some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that he might deceive me in this undertaking.</P>
<P>I began to be in some fear of having a knavish trick played me, and would have recalled the vessel if it had not been too late; but hoping for the best, I resolved to cruize till the time appointed was expired.</P>
<P>I had cloathed my two Indians, that were presented me by the governor of Buenos Ayres, in European habits very handsome; and instructed them in the English tongue: they very readily learnt; and I gave them all the tender usage imaginable, which they were obligingly sensible of; and I believe they would have sacrificed their lives to have served me. I found them very handy, and docible, and very good|natured; which convinces me if mild methods were used with them, they might very easily be brought to be friends to the Europeans; especially the English. And I think it is a great pity, such a vast body of people should be ignorant of the Divine Being that formed the universe. Though the Span|iards,
<PB N="136" REF="046409_0134_10215F06F5CFAE38">
'tis true, send missionaries among them to inculcate Chris|tianity, yet they generally neglect their holy functions, and strive all they can to enrich themselves, by laying exorbitant taxes upon the poor Indians: and I have been informed, that in some parts of America, all the wealth they get is delivered to the mission, reserving to themselves only what is needful, and that but from day to day, I had my two Indians made Christians; one by the name of Robert, and the other Joseph; being mine and my father's names. And I hope, in the sight of God, lay-baptism will suffice; espe|cially when we had not the happiness of the other form. And it is not impossible, if they lead good lives, they may find the road to heaven as well as if they had been christened in a church by an orthodox clergyman.</P>
<P>Three days before the time I expected my Spaniard back, we discovered two sail making up to us, which us pre|pare for an engagement; but we soon perceived it was our prize with another vessel. The Spaniard came on board, and informed me that he had been something better than his word, for he believed that in money and in goods, he had brought to the value of 80,000 dollars. He gave us the following account, by Roberts:</P>
<P>Last time I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> prisoner in Baldivia, I was compelled to work for one Don Sancho Ramirez, a sordid, covetous, jea|lous, malicious wretch, one that used to deal in merchandize. It was his usual method to wait at a country-house near the sea, for the arrival of the Real Situado ship, (which was the same I had taken) and then go privately on board to deal with the merchants. The knowledge of this made me undertake this expedition, as well as to get money, as to be revenged on the old villain, for the stripes he has often given me without any provocation. When we arrived within half a league of the place, we perceived a bark riding at an|chor. I began to demur, as fearing we might be discov|ered; but at last resolved to proceed, let what would hap|pen. The bark weighed and made towards us, which oc|casioned another surprise; but my fears were soon over, when I perceived Don Sancho upon deck. He hailed us, and de|sired we would slacken sail, that he might come on board. Accordingly we ran into a small creek, and came to an an|chor. I did not appear at first, but let the other Spaniard
<PB N="137" REF="046409_0135_10215F095D1DD798">
that went with us personate the captain, and instructed him accordingly. As soon as he came on board, he enquired for Don Juan Villegro, (for that gentleman used to command the Real Situado) and was answered, that he was very ill, and could not sail this voyage. Then he enquired for the merchants, telling him, that the governor had discovered his usual practice of dealing first with them; therefore he had contrived to meet us in one of his own vessels, that was ready laden for Buenos Ayres, and only staid for our arrival to set sail. I was glad to hear of that, because I intended to make a prize of it. The Spaniard invited him into the cab|in, while I went on board his bark with ten men armed, and secured it, there being but five men and a boy in it. The rest of the crew were on shore.</P>
<P>I cut her cable, and our own, and made out to sea again. When we were under sail, I came on board, and shewed myself to the old Don, and in a few words made him un|derstand his condition. I thought at first we should have been obliged to have buried him, for he looked a great while like one that was dead. But I recovered him a lit|tle, by shewing him the box that contained his heart and soul, (I mean his money.) He did his endeavour to fly at me to be revenged on me, but he was held; but to give him a little more comfort, I read over to him his bill of la|ding, and told him plainly, I would not deal with him if his goods did not answer his bill. When he found he could do no good by passion, he told me he would give me half his money, if I would restore him ship and cargo. I was very well as I was, I told him: and since I got it all in my possession, I would have no more dealings with him, only the odd ten pieces of eight more for his ransom. He was so thunder-struck at this, that he did not so much as offer to open his mouth to speak; but kept so long silent, that I (fancying he would never speak again) took him upon deck that he might behold the lovely prospect of the water; for by this time we were out of sight of land. His heart then began to melt, and he fell down upon his knees, and beg|ged he might have his liberty, notwithstanding we had rob|bed him. I was in a very great passion, and ordered him to mollify the word, and call it over-reaching; which with much chastisements he did. But I told him he was obliged
<PB N="138" REF="046409_0136_10215F0C9067F380">
to make you honour one visit, and accordingly I have brought him to wait on you.</P>
<P>I must confess, I could not help admiring the Spaniard's ingenuity, and yet I did not greatly relish the action; for though it was a lawful prize to us, yet I thought it was downright robbery in him. However, I gave him the thanks our interest required; and farther told him, by Roberts our interpreter, that he should be very well rewarded for his undertaking.</P>
<P>The old Spaniard was brought on board of us, more dead than alive; and understanding we were English, he spoke to me in that language, and begged he might be set at lib|erty. I told him he need not apprehend any thing, for he should have his liberty and civil usage. He thanked me as well as his grief would give him leave, and I invited him to dine with me, which he did accordingly the same day.</P>
<P>I ordered the cargo out of the bark, which was very con|siderable, and most of the provision, because I feared it would be what we should want. The other vessel, as belonging to the king of Spain, and one who could pretty well bear that loss, I intended to keep for ourselves. The bark I re|stored to Don Ramirez, with several bales of goods that would prove of small use to us, though of value to him; nay, I would very willingly have given him all his goods and mo|ney too, if it had not been for wronging my crew, for, as I said, I looked upon it as gained by fraud. However I ventured to give him back twenty thousand ryals, which did not amount to mine and my owner's share. He returned me his acknowledgments, by giving me a very handsome ring that they had taken from him, and told me, he ever thought the English generous enemies.</P>
<P>I caused all the prisoners to be put on board the bark, and took my leave of them. They returned me abundance of thanks for my kind usage: and vowed if ever fortune should send any of our countrymen among them, they should fare the better for my sake. I must own I was not dis|pleased with their acknowledgments. A man feels a secret pleasure within himself when he has done a humane action;
<PB N="139" REF="046409_0137_10215F0E1AB8CE18">
when on the contrary, if a person has been guilty of base|ness, horror and remorse gnaws his conscience.</P>
<P>The day after I had parted with the prisoners, I summoned all my men upon deck, and told them what the Spaniard had done for them, and advised with them what recompense I should make him. We soon agreed he should have five thousand pieces of eight, his companion five hundred, and the rest of them entered to a share of the booty we had before taken. Accordingly I sent for them, and told them what I intended. The Spaniard returned me suitable thanks in French; for he had been informed I understood that lan|guage. I found in his discourse, a ready turn of wit and humour, and of a person that had read mankind. He did not seem to be above thirty years of age, of a free and open nature, having nothing of the stiff formality of the Spaniard, though born a Seville in Old Spain. I told him I expected a short account of his life; he readily answered, he should be proud to comply with my desires, but he begged I would defer it for some time, till he might be a little more used to my conversation; for, said he, smiling, mine has been a very merry and odd sort of a life, and therefore, till I have more freedom, I shall desist, because I shall lose the spirit in telling it.</P>
<P>We steered our course towards Panama, depending that our prisoners would spread the report of our going back again for the North Sea. In thirty-six degrees, and forty-five min|utes, we discovered a vessel steering the same course: I or|dered the prize to chase her, and before night she took her. It was a bark laden with tallow and hides, bound for La Conception. I repented the taking of her, for we soon found she was but a heavy sailor, and therefore could not keep company with us, and it was not proper for us to let them depart.</P>
<P>Don Pedro Aquillio, which was the name of our intelli|gent Spaniard, told me, he would undertake to dispose of the cargo and bark to a good advantage, if I could tell how to dispose of the men, which were but four, that is, three Indians and a Spaniard. The Indians were very well pleased to be received as servants on board; yet we allowed then half a share in our future purchases. The Spaniard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in|tended
<PB N="140" REF="046409_0138_10215F108A436D18">
to detain, on board till we had made our cruising, voy|age, and then release him. So depending on Don Pedro's ingenuity. I let him go off with the bark, with three Span|iards to assist him, having his promise to return the next day. We were then within five league of La Conception, and therefore resolved to remain in that station till his ar|rival. keeping Mamelles de Biobio, or the dugs of Biobio (two rocks so called) in view.</P>
<P>The next day we perceived him coming with a pirogue, (a small Spanish boat with one sail). He brought me a hand|some present of fruit; and enough besides for the whole crew. Well, said he, I have made but an indifferent bar|gain; I have brought you but twenty thousand pieces of eight; the old rogue of a governor would not give any more. He told me that the governor of La Conception engrossed all the tallow and hides, and forced the retailers to give him his own price; so he went boldly to him, and sold him bark and cargo.</P>
<P>Don Pedro advised us to cruise for the Manilla ship, which was daily expected. His advice was approved of on all hands: therefore, orders were given to wood and water the ships for the voyage; and accordingly we made for Juan Fer|nando, and arrived there the fifth of September 1695. It being a remarkable day with me, it lives in my memory; for the loss of my journal by an odd accident, hinders me keeping a regular account. We spent two days in wood|ing and watering, and killing goats, which are there in great plenty.</P>
<P>There are three islands that bear the name of Juan Fer|nando, the first discoverer, though there are no other inhab|itants on them than goats. There's a noble bay on the north side of the island capable of containing five hundred sail, where you anchor at sixteen fathom water, a sandy bottom. We left it with a favourable wind for our design, and made far|ther up the coast, January the first; and was feared we had missed our booty, for the Manilla ship generally arrives at, Acapulco about Christmas; however, we resolved to coast about for twenty days longer, and if we sailed of her, to return into the North Sea, with a design to cruise down the coast.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="046409_0139_10215F12169EB1F8">
We kept out of sight of land, for fear of being discovered.</P>
<P>On the sixth we perceived two sail, and accordingly gave them chance. Don Pedro assured me it was the Manilla ship, and a guard ship along with her. We called a council im|mediately; where it was resolved the bark should attack the Manilla ship, while ours was to engage the man of war; and this was the reason Don Pedro gave for it; that the Manilla ship was so very unwieldy, the bark could play round her, and being so small, she was out of the reach of their cannon, for they could make no use but of those upon their upper deck, The man of war seeing we gave them chace, slackened her sail to stay for us, imagining we should both attack him, but he found himself mistaken. Our pink passed him without firing a gun; but as soon as ever we came along side, we gave him a broadside, with a loud huzza. He soon returned it, but we plied him so close, that he began to make off; but we followed him close at the heels, and coming under his starboard quarter, gave him another broad|side, which brought his mainmast by the board; upon which he immediately struck.</P>
<P>The sea being very smooth, though a handsome breeze of wind, we manned our long-boat, and I went on board with forty hands, well armed. When I came upon deck, I or|dered the Spaniards to be taken on board, and secured un|der hatches; but I was much surprised to find but sixteen men in the ship, besides eight that were killed, and not one that appeared like an officer among them. But we were soon informed that the captain had ordered one hundred and fifty of his men on board the Manilla ship, as soon as they had discovered us in the morning, because her crew were most of them sickly.</P>
<P>We imagined our small vessel must have warm work of it, being not above thirty-five hands in all. So we resolved immediately to cut off the rudder of the man of war, and leave her; for having lost her main-mast, she could not fol|low us to do us any damage; and six of her men were ta|ken on board us, who finding we were English, seemed very willing to serve us; and I promised them their share in the booty, if we succeeded. These six men were old Christians,
<PB N="142" REF="046409_0140_10215F1542334350">
as they called themselves, and they value themselves very much upon it, despising the Creolians.</P>
<P>We made all the sail we could after the Manilla ship, and soon overtook her; for our small vessel had kept her very well in play, though she had warm work of it, and her rig|ging was very much shattered, though they had not lost a single man, but she was obliged to fall astern to mend her tackle. I ordered them to send me twenty men on board, which I was obliged to lie by for. I had brought all my guns to bear on one side, and did not fire one till I came under her stern; and then I poured them into her, and tacked about to charge again. I observed a boat busy about her stern, but could not imagine what they were doing: However, I resol|ved they that were in it should find it a difficult matter to go on board again; but I was much surprised to find it my own boat with Don Pedro in it, who had taken the occasion in the smoke of our first broadside to nail up the rudder, so that the ship could not tack about. He made what haste be, could on board the bark, which had now mended all her ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ging, and got under the stern; and as fast as the Manil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a ship sent men to clear her rudder, he prevented them with his small shot. In the mean time, we ventured to come along side of her, notwithstanding her monstrous bulk, and gave her such entertainment that she called out at last for quarter, and struck their colours. I ordered all the officers to come on board, which they did. I received them all very civilly, and immediately after went on board the prize. I was ama|zed at her vast bulk. She had seven decks, and built so strong, that not one of our shot had gone through; yet they had above sixty men killed, through their ports, and other vacancies; and what was very surprising, we had not one, and but two wounded.</P>
<P>They had above an hundred men sick on board them, so that the ship looked like an hospital. It was very richly laden, and valued at 1,800,000 dollars, and upwards. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound but little money on board, besides the plate belong|ing to the governor of Luconia, (one of the Philippine islands) who was coming home to his own country, being a native of Mexico.</P>
<P>Though this was the richest prize that ever was taken, yet
<PB N="143" REF="046409_0141_10215F17B17E8070">
we did not know well what to do with it. It would be an impossibility to work into the North Sea, or back again to the East-Indies, without farther help; for we had more pris|oners by two to one, than we had sailors on board, so we once more advised with Don Pedro, who counselled us to send to Acapulco, and have the ship and men ransomed. We all thought it would be both difficult and dangerous. Don Pedro told us it should be neither, and he would undertake to do it. But however, as it was a thing of very great consequence, we desired he would tell us in what manner it should be done. Why as thus, said he, I'll take the bark, with the captain of the Spanish man of war, the quondam governor, and one or two more of the best quality, who shall make the case known to the city of Acapulco, and no other way but by letter; for I will suffer but one of them to go on shore, and I'll take care to order it well enough to give you notice, if they should send any force against us, though there is no danger if they should. For, added he, they have so man of war within two hundred leagues of them, that which is taken being all they had to guard their coast. We were well satisfied with his reasons, and gave him leave to proceed as he thought fit; and accordingly the next day he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at fail, with those persons mentioned along with him; and, by the advice of all, we followed him, being very well con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ced by the Spaniards themselves, there was nothing of force to be apprehended. I had fitted up the Spanish man of war again, and resolved to keep her, and dispose of the bark. Therefore, as soon as we came within sight of land, I ordered every thing to be taken out of her, and put on board the Spaniard, which we sound was a very good sailor.</P>
<P>The day following, Don Pedro came on board, with sev|eral merchants and persons of quality to treat about the ran|som of the prize; and we agreed for 1,<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">00,000 dollars, af|ter we had taken several bales of rich goods out of her. The money was to be paid in six days, and we were to stay where we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ode; for I did not much care to trust them too far.</P>
<P>Is the mean time, we sent all their sick and wounded an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The bark was disposed of for provision, and other necessities, and we took the opportunity in waiting for the money, to water our ships. At the time appointed, the mon|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> came, and we surrendered the ship to the Spaniards.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="046409_0142_10215F1A25EEF3E8">
Now we agreed, by joint consent, to go home, for we were all rich enough, and every one of the crew thought so; yet we resolved to touch at St. Salvador on the coast of Brazil, (and make our way through the Magellan streight) as well to take in some refreshment, as to dispose of the rest of our goods, and careen our vessels.</P>
<P>Accordingly we put our design in execution, and made the best of our way for the streights of Magellan, and discovered those noted clouds, (which are a sure guide to sailors) the third of May. We found the weather extremely cold, and the mountains covered with snow; but we were well pro|vided with good liquors, and all convenient cloathing. We anchored in Port Famine; formerly called Knight's Bay, by the Dutch in a voyage 1568, with a fleet of five fail; where, meeting with many troubles, and to eternize the memory of the voyage, (it being the first the Dutch made to these streights)&punc; the admiral knighted six of the officers, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Knights of the Furious Lion. The oaths they received at the ceremony, were, Never to do, or consent to do any|thing against their honours or to prejudice their present voy|age; To expose their lives to the service of the common|wealth; and, To do their utmost in driving the Spaniards from their golden world. They were installed on shore, with a sea-green garter, and a table built with their names en|graved on it.</P>
<P>We saw several of the inhabitants, who were easily pre|vailed upon to come on board us. But I could find no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ing extraordinary in their height, as is fabulously repo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">. The tallest I could see among them did not exceed six feet. They are certainly a poor miserable people, but very harm|less; and I am apt to believe all former stories of their monstrous height and cruelty, to be fables.</P>
<P>We got through the streights once more into the North Sea, and by degrees came into a warmer climate. But a terrible storm overtook us, just as we were in sight of Pepy's Island, much drove us within sight of Port Desire, upon the continent&punc; and therefore we thought it the safest way to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into the bay, which accordingly we did, came to as an|chor in seventeen fathom water.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="046409_0143_10215F1C0AAFF640">
At the south side of the port lies Penguin Island, so cal|led from a multiplicity of those birds resorting there. Our men went on shore, and in three hours time brought on board five hundred of the fowls, and several thousands of their eggs, which proved delicious food. They are called Penguin, not from their fatness, as some others affirm, but from their white|ness mixed with black. They are about the bigness of a goose, weighing from nine to fourteen pounds: and though their chief diet is fish, yet they have no fishy taste. Their skin is very thick, their bill is like that of a raven, though not altogether so crooked; their neck is short and thick, and the rest of their body resembles a goose, excepting the wings, which are only two stumps covered with feathers, which they make use of in swimming. Their feet are black, like those of a swan. They breed in holes of the rocks, which are so numerous, there is no walking hardly for fear of fall|ing into them. When they walk on shore 'tis upright with their wings hanging, so that they appear in that posture like small pigmies. We staid but two days here, and then steer|ed our course for Rio Janeiro, or the River of January, intending to touch at St. Sebastian's first, and if we did not succeed there, to sail to St. Salvador. When we arrived there, the Portuguese would not admit us to enter the bay, but fired several guns from the forts laden with shot, to de|ter us from anchoring: we could not imagine the mean|ing of it, but however we left them in that humour, and steered for St. Salvador, and in one and twenty days we dis|covered Praya de Zumba, a place very easily known from a number of white spots, which appear like linen hung out to whiten or dry.</P>
<P>We passed Fort St. Anthony, and saluted it with eleven guns, which returned us an equal number, without the charge of shot, and came to an anchor within half a league of the city; which we also saluted with eleven guns, and received but seven in return.</P>
<P>By advice of the officers, we shared among the sailors a thousand pieces of eight a man, which pleased them exceed|ingly. The next day I went to wait on the governor, who received me very civilly, and desired I would dine with him. We were very magnificently served, and a band of Italian music played all the while. After dinner I made my pres|ents,
<PB N="146" REF="046409_0144_10215F1EA97E7790">
which he accepted of very kindly, but when I came to treat about our commerce, he flatly denied me, telling me it was against the King of Portugal's express orders to suffer any trading with foreigners. I begged his pardon if it was not to be complied with. He would have returned my present, but I pressed him to accept it in so obliging a manner that he did; and told me in French, that since he saw my generosity he would comply with me. He im|mediately sent for several merchants, and took them into his closet, where they stayed some time. When they came out again, the governor told me those gentlemen would go on board, and view our commodities, and if we could agree, he would be answerable for the money. One of the persons seemed to be of a more free and open disposition than the Portuguese generally are; (though most of the inhabitants of St. Salvador affect the manners of the French.) We soon made an end of our bargain, and my merry merchant would oblige me to go ashore and sup with him that night. He pressed me so heartily, that I could not refuse him; and accordingly I went with only my two Indian servants, who began to be understood in English.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the merchant's house, I was surpri|sed to find it so magnificent. He led us into a handsome summer-house in the garden, where he told me we were to sup; and, said he, to convince you that you are welcome, I'll bring my wife and daughter to keep us company, which is reckoned as a thing extraordinary among us. But, added he, I have been in England and France, and I find the wo|men are not the less honest, for having their liberty. I told him I thought constraint did but whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their inventions to gain their desires. Said he, I am of your mind, there|fore give them all the liberty they desire, and I can't find I have had any reason to repent it.</P>
<P>In a little time he ushered in the two ladies, his wife and daughter, both very beautiful, and notwithstanding the heat of the climate, very fair. The wife seemed about five and thirty, the daughter about sixteen, and they both spoke very good French. Our conversation was kept up with all the spirit I was capable of: I soon discovered a great deal of wit in them both, and made them my compliment, in find|ing ladies so extraordinary in so remote a part of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="046409_0145_10215F22E779F8E8">
When we had supped, the merchant (whose name was Don Jaques) told me it was his custom to provide beds for his guests, as well as supper: and, after we had walked a turn or two round the garden, we all retired to our sev|eral apartments.</P>
<P>The next morning we drank chocolate together, and I in|vited Don Jaques, with his wife and daughter, to dine with me on board the next day, which he consented to. I now begged leave to be gone; but it being very hot, he had provided me with a silk Palanquin: which is a thing like a hammock, with a canopy over it, carried by two blacks, with each a rest to hang it on while they take breath. This is all the vehicle in use at St. Salvador, by reason of the unevenness and steepness of the situation.</P>
<P>I prepared for them with all the magnificence I could the next day. And when they saw the variety of dishes, dres|sed after the English manner, they were mightily pleased; and to add to their satisfaction, the music I had on board played several elegant pieces, accompanied with the trumpet I had got from on board the Spanish prize, for notwithstand|ing his being trumpeter to the garrison of Baldivia, yet he was better pleased to be where he was. We drank the King of England's, and the King of Portugal's health sev|eral times, with the discharge of our cannon: and when the time for their going on shore came, I fastened a small present of several sorts of silk upon the wife and daughter. Don Jaques perceived what I was about, and merrily said, That is not fair; we did not pay you for your company yesterday, and yet I believe it was as valuable as that you received to-day, at least in my opinion; I shan't answer for the ladies, said he, they are both capable of speaking for them|selves. I received many compliments on all hands: but not dealing much in them, I am very willing to forget them.</P>
<P>In a day or two after, Don Jaques came on board, and told me the money for the goods was ready, but I should not have it, unless I came myself to receive it. I ac|cordingly went with him, and he made me continue there all night, where we had the conversation of the ladies as before.</P>
<P>When I was going away the next day, he told me he
<PB N="148" REF="046409_0146_10215F24712DE7A0">
should soon find if any thing else but money had the power to bring me to see him. After dinner I expressed a desire of seeing the most remarkable places in the city, which he complied with, and ordered two Palanquins to carry us.</P>
<P>The city of St. Salvador, the capital of Brazil, is situated in the bay of All Saints, in 12 degrees 45 minutes southern latitude. It is divided into two towns, upper and lower. The streets are straight, and pretty broad, but most of them very steep; and all the goods are hoisted in and out of the vessels by machines for that purpose. It was formerly un|der the dominion of the Spaniards, but taken from them by the Dutch in 1624, and pretty well fortified by them; yet notwithstanding that, the Spaniards retook it the next year. I could not learn how long the Portuguese have possessed it, but they all agreed upwards of fifty years. They have made it a regular fortified place, and very strong, having five forts besides the castle, and stored with cannon, and other ammunition, and small arms for ten thousand men. This is the usual seat of the viceroy of Brazil; but when I was there, it was without one, though he was expected every day.</P>
<P>The cathedral is a magnificent pile of building, finely adorned, and painted after the modern manner. The jes|uits' church is a noble structure, all of European marble, with a fine organ, the pipes gilt. There are many more fine churches, twenty in all, besides several convents and monasteries.</P>
<P>This place is also the residence of a bishop, who has a handsome palace; and for the reverend clergy, I never saw such a number for the bigness of the place, any where, as, Benedictines, Franciscans, Carmelites, Augustines, Capuchines, Dominicans, and Bare-footed Friars; (though I think most of the people I saw there wore no stockings.) There are three nunneries, well stored with nuns, but not to be seen; nor hardly any women in the town, but common whores or black slaves; for the Portuguese look up their wives and daughters as carefully as they do their money, and would have none look upon them but themselves: except my friend Don Jaques, which is something the more extraordinary.</P>
<P>It is a place of great trade to Guinea, and other parts,
<PB N="149" REF="046409_0147_10215F260076E968">
and is accounted one of the richest cities in the King of Portugal's dominions. By moderate account, there may be about 20,000 whites, or I should say, Portuguese; (for they are none of the whitest) and about treble that num|ber of slaves.</P>
<P>Don Jaques would make me take up five days in view|ing the several parts of the city, and obliged me to be at his house without going on board during that time. Some part of the day we played at ombre, a game mightily in vogue among the Spaniards and Portuguese and a very en|tertaining game for three, invented by the jealous Spaniards for that number, to prevent any clandestine doings between two. But alas! I believe there are more opportunities gained than lost by it.</P>
<P>We had provided every thing we wanted now, and be|gan to prepare for our departure.</P>
<P>Don Jaques was very sorry to lose me, he told me; and indeed it was with some regret I left him; for his ci|vility had drawn from me a friendship insensibly. I went to take leave of the governor, who made me a present of American sweet-meats, and begged I would dine with him, which I could not in good manners deny. When dinner was over, Don Jaques was so obligingly pressing for me to sup with him the last time, that I could not refuse; but I begged he would excuse my staying all right, and he gave me his word he would not press me. I sent one of my Indians to order the boat to fetch me as ten that evening.</P>
<P>When the time of my stay was expired, I took my leave of Don Jaques and the family, after having forced him to accept of a gold watch, and the ladies a present each of a diamond ring, that I received from the governor of Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o|nia, for my civility in returning him his plate and jewels, when we took the Acapulco ship in the South Sea.</P>
<P>Well, said Don Jaques, I see you will pay for vour boat! in spite of my teeth. I had taken leave of the wife and daughter before, who had left us in tears. I must own I thought myself very much obliged for their tenderness; and it drew such a deep melancholy upon my face, with thoughts
<PB N="150" REF="046409_0148_10215F288C85B040">
of my dear wife, that Don Jaques imagined it was grief for parting with him and his family. I did not take any pains to undeceive him. Well, said he, I see a friendship may be contracted in a few days, as well as love, especially where there is a harmony of souls.</P>
<P>We had agreed to correspond together, and I had under|taken to send him some European goods, if it pleased God to guard me safe to Europe. I had continued longer with Don Jaques than I had intended to do, therefore whatever violence I did myself, I took my leave. Don Jaques ten|derly embraced me, and was so much overwhelmed with grief, that I could not forbear sympathizing with him; but I or|dered his servants (whom I had liberally rewarded for the trouble I gave) to shut the door, to prevent their master's going any farther.</P>
<P>I walked towards the port very melancholy, though with some precipitation; but was roused out of it by one of my Indians crying, Master take a care, take a care! I turned about, and saw four Portuguese pursuing us. I made a stand, and drew my sword, took my cloak from my Indian, and put it across my arm to defend myself the better. They all four attacked me at once; but my Indians, whom I had ordered to wear swords on shore, fell upon them furi|ously, and dispatched two of them immediately; and I had made a shift to drop a third, though not without receiving several wounds. The fourth ran for it; but my Indians being as nimble-footed as does, soon overtook him, and dragged him down the hill by the hair of his head; while he cried out all the while, <HI>Misericordia! Misericordia!</HI> The noise we made had brought up my boat's crew, who were all armed with pistols and cutlasses: and the guard coming in the mean time, and seeing my Indians dragging the fugitive, fell upon us; but my crew and Indians char|ged them so furiously, that they soon put them to slight, though treble our number; though this availed us but lit|tle, for the whole garrison was coming down upon us. I then ordered my crew to resist no more, but submit to them: for as we were innocent, I did not much fear to come off clear.</P>
<P>The bustle had roused Don Jaques, and his servants, who were soon informed of the condition I was in, and he came
<PB N="151" REF="046409_0149_10215F2BE4B98CE0">
in good time to interpose his authority; for the Portuguese began to be outrageous. But the governor had sent a gen|tleman to bring us before him: and accordingly I went ac|companied by Don Jaques. But the wounds I received bled so much, that they were obliged to carry me to Don Ja|ques's, and send for a surgeon. My hurts were not dan|gerous, but I was very faint with loss of blood.</P>
<P>Don Jaques waited on the governor, and informed him of the condition I was in; but the governor not understand|ing who was the aggressor, ordered a guard of soldiers at the door of the house, where I was. My boat's crew soon got on board, and alarmed both the ships, who immediately weighed and came close to shore, where they had prepared to fire upon the town, if I was not released instantly. I understanding the matter, sent one to inform them, that the guard was set upon me to secure me from the insults of the Portuguese, till the truth of the matter was discovered. This would not serve their turn, but a hundred of them, with the officers of Don Pedro, landed all well armed and vowed to wait the event on shore. The governor did me the honour of a visit, and enquired into the cause, and I informed him, as well as my weakness would permit me. When they had examined the dead Portuguese, they found one of them was nephew to the deceased viceroy. Upon the discovery of which, the Portuguese began to be very much exasperated, and were hardly restrained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rushing into the house, and tearing me to pieces: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they did not regard the nephew, yet they had a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ration for his deceased uncle, who behaved himself with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> great deal of candour in his post, and the inhabitants mightily re|gretted his loss. The governor appeased their fury&punc; by tell|ing them I should have no favour shewn me if I was guil|ty, let the consequence be what it would. And immedi|ately a court was summoned to try me, though it was mid|night, and I was carried there in a Palanquin, weak as I was. But I was obliged to send for my lieutenant, and tell him there was no danger; and also ordered him to send the crew on board again. When we came to the place of jus|tice, the governor ordered me a seat; but the business was soon ended; for the Portuguese we had secured, owned that his master had designed to murder me, because he was in|formed I was his rival in the beautiful Donna Blanca, (which
<PB N="152" REF="046409_0150_10215F2E91B64D40">
was the daughter of Don Jaques.) I was very much sur|prised (as well as Don Jaques) at this report, and we both declared it was only a jealous suggestion of the gentleman; which every one came into; and the ground he had for it, was my often frequenting Don Jaques's house, upon the score of friendship only, and lodging there.</P>
<P>The governor handsomely dismissed me, and told me he was very sorry I had been detained from my affairs. I re|turned, that I was as sorry to be the cause of so unhappy an accident, in a country where I had received so much civility.</P>
<P>Don Jaques begged I would go back to his house, and stay till my wounds were well; but the governor took us aside, and said to us in French, I know, Don Jaques, 'tis your friendship for the captain that makes you desire his company; but if I might advise you, I would have him go on board upon the instant; for though he is very in|nocent as to the matter, yet I doubt some of the decea|sed's friends or relations, which are numerous, not having regard to justice, will contrive some method to dispatch him out of the way; for most of the Portuguese are jea|lous, malicious, and revengeful, and very seldom look into the merits of a cause.</P>
<P>I thanked the governor for his kind caution; and Don Jaques, notwithstanding his friendship, could not but come into what he said. I therefore ordered myself to be car|ried on board that moment. It being broad day, the gov|ernor and his guard would accompany me to the water-side, but Don Jaques would go on board with me. In the boat he told me he had some thoughts of coming to reside in England, for, said he, I have enough, and therefore I will, in two or three years more, leave off traffic and live quiet in the world. But he begged I would write to him as soon as I arrived in Europe, and let him know the place I had chose to live in; for, added he, let it be where it will, if it is ever in my fortune to arrive safe in Europe, I'll make another voyage only for the hopes of seeing you. I returned him the acknowledgment due to so much friend|ship, and we parted with tears on both sides.</P>
<P>As soon as I had got on hoard, the wind being fair, we
<PB N="153" REF="046409_0151_10215F311AB1D4F0">
weighed and stood out of the bay. When we were out at sea, a letter was brought me written in French, the trans|lation of which is as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I was resolved to make trial of you before I suffered my heart to chuse you for a friend; and I am so well convinced of the sincerity of your soul, that I will confide in you a secret dear to my repose. I had an amour with a beautiful lady before I was married, that produced the bearer of this letter. I have kept him concealed from my family hitherto but the person I trusted with his educa|tion and this secret, being dead, I feared I should find some difficulty to conceal him any longer here: therefore, depending upon your good nature and friendship&punc; I have ventured to send him to you, with sufficient to bear his ex|pences in his education, which I would have suitable to the estate I have in my power to give him. I shall ever earn this obligation, and always think it my greatest hap|piness to subscribe myself</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Your sincere friend and serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> JAQUES DE RAMIREZ.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I must own I was very much surprised at this epistle, and could not imagine his reasons for concealing it from me. I ordered the person that brought the letter to be conducted in, and immediately entered my cabin one of the beautiful|lest boys I had ever sat my eyes on. He seemed about fif|teen, his hair fair and long, curling down his shoulders; in short, every feature so exact and uniform, and so innocent withal, that I was amazed. At last I took him by the hand and embraced him, and told him for his father's sake, he should be as dear to me as my own son. But finding he did not answer me, for I spoke to him in English, I repeated the same in French: he returned me thanks, and said he did not doubt but he should find it so.</P>
<P>After some time, he delivered me a casket, in which were jewels to the value of five thousand pistoles, and a little box
<PB N="154" REF="046409_0152_10215F33A40684D8">
which contained a thousand moidores. I told him I would take as much care of them as if they were my own.</P>
<P>These, Sir, said the youth, are designed to bear my char|ges. Then ordering another box in, had it opened, and told me what it contained was a present from his father to me. When I examined it, I found six silver dishes, and three dozen of plates of the same metal; a dozen of knives, forks, and spoons in gold, and half a dozen of gold sweet-meat plates. In a large box was a variety of all manner of conserves, and cordials; and I was informed he had made small presents to every officer in the ship, and to the common sailors a week's fresh provision, with liquor in proportion. I was ama|zed at his bounty, for his present to me was what a prince might have received. I thought it was my duty to shew all the kindness I was capable of to the son of so generous a father; therefore I ordered him a field-bed in my cabin; and his behaviour was so engaging, that I felt as much ten|derness for him as if he had been my own child; and hav|ing skill in surgery, I trusted him with the management of my wounds; though I had a very good ship-surgeon, who supplied him with what he wanted. My hurts, which were not dangerous, soon healed, and I recovered my strength again I could not prevail upon young Don Ferdinand (Don Jaque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'s son) to go often upon deck. He said he would rather chuse to stay in the cabin, where he had French Books of his own, and some of mine to entertain him; for I had taken an op|portunity to procure several at St. Salvador, and among the rest, a French and English Grammar and Dictionary, which mightily pleased Don Ferdinand for he had a great desire to learn English: I gave him all the help I could; and he, in return, instructed me in the Portuguese language: so that in a short time we could discourse in either.</P>
<P>We had resolved to steer our course for the island of Ter|cera, the capital of Azores; and after fifty days sail, we dis|covered the peak of one of the islands of Azores, which is called Pico, from the mountain. It is in the resemblance of a pyramid, and may be discovered as many leagues off as the peak of Teneriff; for we were then by observations thirty leagues off from it, and yet could see it distinctly.</P>
<P>In two days more we discovered the island of St. Michael.
<PB N="155" REF="046409_0153_10215F360B536A00">
We were all pleased that we had entered that part of the world we call Europe, the birth place of most of us; and what pleased us more, was, that we had fortunes.</P>
<P>August the 19th, 1696, we anchored in the bay of An|gra, the capital of the Axores, in the island of Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">era. I cannot give any great commendation of the port, for I think it a very indifferent one. We did not design to stay long, only to get some water, and some fresh provisions; for we were informed there was no riding out a st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> there. We got in what we wanted with all the expedition we could, while the weather was favourable.</P>
<P>The city is seated at the bottom of the bay, under the brow of a hill called Monto de Brazil, or the Brazil mountain; but for what reason so called I could not be informed. It is very well fortified, having two strong castles, and eight bat|teries besides, with guns of thirty pounds shot: But it is very indifferently garrisoned, having no more than two hundred men in pay, and most wretchedly supplied, having no clothing for three years.</P>
<P>The town is very agreeable, having a stream of water run|ning quite through it, which drives several mills for the use of the public; and almost in every quarter are public foun|tains of excellent tasted water. From this place are brought the finest Canary birds; though less than those of the Cana|ries, yet they exceed them far in the excellency of their pipes.</P>
<P>Money is very scarce here, and consequently every thing cheap. I bought two months biscuit for the ships much cheaper than in any port of Europe. Corn is their chief commodi|ty, which they send to Portugal; but for any other trade, I believe the King of Portugal gets but little advantage.</P>
<P>I was grown such a proficient in the Portuguese tongue, that I could make a shift to be understood; and by under|standing that language, soon sound a gate to the Spanish tongue, by the help of Don Pedro, who had learned to speak English very fluently. We got acquainted with one of the fathers of the Cordeliers, who shewed us the churches, and other things of note in the city. The cathedral is a very hand|some building, and well painted, which goes by the name of
<PB N="156" REF="046409_0154_10215F38A45E0B18">
St. Salvador; and there is no danger of missing that title, and St. Anthony, every where among the Portuguese. There's no less them twenty, besides the cathedral; with four monas|teries, and four convents, that have each their chapel beau|tifully adorned.</P>
<P>When we had got what refreshments were wanting, we sat sail for the Streights, intending to touch no where, before we were got into the Mediterranean; and because we met with nothing extraordinary in our voyage to Gibraltar, I will, to divert the reader, give him (instead of bearings of coasts changes of wind, and unexpected storms) the life of my com|panion, Don Pedro Aquillio, which he related to us during the voyage, in the following manner.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF DON PEDRO AQUILLIO.</HEAD>
<P>MY father residing at France, when the commotions were engendering between the king and the parliament, was made fast to the interest of Cardinal de Retz, by marrying one of his nieces, of a very great fortune: he had a hand in most of the secret transactions of those times; and wa|ding too deep in those seas of trouble, was obliged to re|tire to his native country. He, foreseeing what would hap|pen, took care of his affairs accordingly, sold his estate in France, and sent my mother to Seville, the place of his birth, whither he soon followed. The King of Spain having a very great regard for him gave him several offices of hon|our and profit; and when I was born, I was son to the first man in the city. My father, by living so long in France, had contracted the manners of the French; and the formality of the Spaniard's seemed as strange to him as if he had been born in another climate. He had several chil|dren, though none survived but myself. When I had years enough over my head to fear the prejudice of education, he took a resolution of sending me to the college of the four nations in Paris, to complete my studies. And the first
<PB N="158" REF="046409_0156_10215F3E297FFA48">
thing I learnt, was to shake off all the customs of Spain, which was soon done; for they had taken but small impres|sion in my mind, because I found my father was averse to them. I contracted a friendship with several young French noblemen of my own age: for parity of years is the first step to friendship.</P>
<P>When I had reached my fifteenth year, I began to think of a mistress to complete my studies. And, as I found it was a method among my companions to supplant each other in their females without any animosity, I set myself so wil|lingly about it, that out of a dozen Madonas, I made my|self master of six of them. This occasioned many plots and contrivances to regain the flying fair ones: though I per|ceived most money laid out in presents had a prevailing force with them. We had our allowance paid quarterly, and get|ting all my companions into gaming, I had the good for|tune to strip them all. They seemed to be a little unea|sy, in losing their mistresses and money too; and my tell|ing them, as I had got the females, I should have most oc|casion for money, signified nothing, but they all begged it as a great favour, that I would lend them one half what I had won, to be repaid the next quarter; which, to oblige them, I complied with, and to play we fell again; but fortune changed her amiable looks from me, and I soon lost all I had won, with my own share too. The fickle dame favoured one of the company who would not lend any of us a penny. This chagrined the rest very much. But to prevent any more importunity, he went away into his own chamber, leaving room in all our pockets for the devil to dance a saraband, for we had not one cross to keep him out; and what was our greatest mortification, the holi|days were approaching, that used to give us the opportunity of rambling into the country. The person that won our money happened to be the last that was added to our so|ciety; and though he had not been long among us, we be|gan to be tired of him, as much from his odd humours, as his effeminacy. I at last thought of a project to be re|venged on him, and it was very much approved by the rest of my companions. The holidays being come, we designed for our country rendezvous; but he that bore the purse, would not go with us, without we could produce every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> so much money. This put us to our shifts again: But
<PB N="159" REF="046409_0157_10215F406EADB8E8">
my man, who was an arch wag, begged I would accept of what he had; for I had been so lucky as to have paid him his wages before my loss. I accepted of his offer, and took from him ten Louis d'Ors. We contrived it so well that they were shewn to old Sir Snip from every person of our society. Well, said he, sixty Louis d'Ors will do our business; but who should be the purse-hearer was what he cavilled at; and not caring to trust any of us, (and we re|solved not to trust him) he pitched upon my man to be cash-keeper for us all. And accordingly he put down in his pocket-book, so much money in bank, received of such and such persons, when in reality, he had but twenty Louis d'Ors.</P>
<P>When we had contrived every thing, we took horse, and rode six leagues that evening, to the place where we design|ed to put in execution our project. We had agreed every right to pay the expences of the day, and have it set down in my man's book. But when he was called for, (as we had concerted) no man was to be found. There was strange enquiry made to no purpose; and we all agreed he had ta|ken the opportunity to rob us, and run away with out mon|ey. All that we had to do was to beg of Snip to dis|charge the house. But he declared he had not half a pis|tole in his pocket, which we knew very well, for he had sewed all the rest into his waistcoat. Since it falls out so unluckily, said I, don't let us make known our wants to the house, but go to rest and consult to-morrow. I lay with Snip, for fear he should take it in his head to sneak off. In the night, when I found that he was fast asleep, I bundled up all his cloaths, and threw them out of the window to my man that waited for them.</P>
<P>When morning came, I desired him to rise, that we might get all together to consult; but no cloaths were to be found. He began to storm and swear, but all to no purpose; for not one of his oaths would bring back a rag of his cloaths. He told us in his ravings, that he had lost so much money, sewed up in his waistcoat. We upbraided him for his cove|tousness, in not letting us share with him; but it did not signify any thing. He threatened to go to the provost, and have the landlord secured; and would have done it, if he had not been naked.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="046409_0158_10215F41F793F760">
After raving to no purpose, he was obliged to go to bed to avoid catching cold. He asked us what he should do in his condition, but all the advice we gave him brought him no consolation.</P>
<P>He was very tall, and large made, and we used to call him in ridicule the infant. He proposed to sell his horse to clothe him, but being so much out of size there was not any thing to be had ready made that would fit him: This was still worse and worse; and though the horse was sold for fifty pistoles, we contrived it so that my landlord seized the money for his reckoning. This put him almost beside himself, and he was ready to expire with vexation.</P>
<P>I pretended to be much concerned at this usage, while the rest of the company laughed at his misfortune. I seemed to be very angry with them; and told them I would do my endeavour to remedy every thing. I made them ac|quainted, that I had just called to mind a person, a friend of mine, that lived in the town, much of the infant's size, and I would go to borrow a suit of cloaths for him. He seemed very much rejoiced at this; for he resolved, as soon as ever her was dressed, to take up the landlord, and swear the robbery against him.</P>
<P>I went, as he supposed, about his cloaths; and after staying some time below, I went up with a bundle, and seemed very much concerned that I could not succeed. I told the infant that the gentleman was gone to Lyons about business of concern, and had carried all his cloaths with him. But I had brought him a masquerade habit that he had left be|hind him.</P>
<P>He expressed some satisfaction at the sight of it, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not be confined to lie in bed. But, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">id he, if it were not only for the name of cloaths, a man might as well go naked, for there's no stirring abroad in this dress.</P>
<P>It was the habit of a satyr, that we had made on purpose for the occasion before we left Paris. When we had equipt him, it was as much as I could do to keep my countenance at the figure he made; and he seemed very much dissatisfied
<PB N="161" REF="046409_0159_10215F43B6391698">
with it, but however, he wore it for the conveniency of not lying in bed.</P>
<P>When we were at dinner, we had many contrivances to get away, but none feasible.</P>
<P>I told them at last, I had thought of a design that would certainly do our business, and make up our losses, if the in|fant would consent to it. He readily replied, he would stick at nothing to do that. Why then, said I, if you'll suffer yourself to be shown in that habit, as a monster nearly arrived, I'll answer for the success of it.</P>
<P>After much talk, he agreed to do it, on this proviso, that his face should be disguised. I told him I would step to my friend's house, for the mask that was made to the habit. I returned and gave it to him, and he was soon satisfied with the project.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the bustle we made, none of the house (but the landlord) knew any thing of the matter, and the next day it was given out about the town, that a monster was to be shown in the afternoon. We had procured a chain, and other materials to carry on the joke; and when the time came to show away, we had such a concourse of people to see our monster (it being in the holidays) that our profit gave us much satisfaction. For when the time of showing was over, our money amounted to three and twenty pistoles; and the monster behaved himself so well with our instructions, that he gave a general content.</P>
<P>We had taken care he should appear so fierce, that none should approach near enough to discover the deceit. We had a great deal of diversion at the ignorant people's sug|gestions. One country fellow asked how old he was. I told him four years, three months, and five days. Lord bless me, (he cried out) why, by that time he comes to be twenty, no house will be able to hold him.</P>
<P>In fine, we showed him so long that our money amounted to upwards of one hundred pounds, which pleased our in|fant so well, that he desired to continue a monster all the
<PB N="162" REF="046409_0160_10215F4644A68958">
time of the holidays. But we resolved to carry the joke no farther, though we did not tell him so.</P>
<P>We left the infant chained to the post of the window as usual, went down to my landlord, and gave him instruc|tions how to behave himself. We took care to satisfy him well for the trouble he had been at.</P>
<P>We all rid away to the next village, and putting up our horses, returned on foot, one by one, back again to the inn; and stole up stairs unperceived by any one but the landlord. The infant, finding we staid longer than ordinary, began to make a great noise; which my landlord hearing, he sent up one of his servants, that knew nothing of the secret: when the infant saw him come in, he made several signs to him; but as the fellow knew nothing of the jest, he did not much like the action of the infant, but ran down to his master, frighted out of his wits.</P>
<P>We had made peep-holes in the next room, where we could perceive every action of the infant's; but he was so very much enraged, that he sat down biting his nails for vexation; for he began to perceive the trick we had put upon him. After fitting melancholy some time, he rose up and endeavoured to undo the chains; but as they were tied close behind, and made fast to a staple in the wall, all his efforts were vain. All our care was to contain from laughing, which was a very hard task. When he found he could not free himself, rage entirely possessed him; and the noise he made with stamping, and rattling his chains, brought up several of the servants armed, who opened the door cautiously; but notwithstanding their valour, ran away as soon as they perceived his menacing action; and turn|bling over one another, took the shortest way down stairs.</P>
<P>When we thought he had mortification enough, we sent my landlord into him with a good horse-whip, and a letter in his hand. As soon as he had got within the door, he spoke after this manner, in a landlord like tone. I was pretty well assured at the beginning, that thou wert a rank cheat; but now I am convinced of it, I will chastise thee first, and reason with thee afterwards, like other criminal
<PB N="163" REF="046409_0161_10215F4A11BA8F18">
judges, punish first, and enquire into the demerits of the cause afterwards, that justice may not wait for any body.</P>
<P>These words were followed with some smart strokes, and the dialogue soon began to be in much confusion; for be|tween the roaring of the infant, the bawling of my landlord, and the smacking of the whip, it was a continual jargon of noise; and we were obliged all of us to own, that our host executed his commission to a hair.</P>
<P>When he had a little recovered himself, he began to rea|son with his patient, who, that he might the better hear him, laid himself down on his pallet to condole his afflicted body. But their questions being very long, and the answers but short, consisting of two monosyllable, Ay, or No, I will not trouble you with the relation.</P>
<P>After their dialogue was over, he gave him the letter, which discovered our design upon him. He was thunder|struck at our combination; and uttered such imprecation of revenge, that my landlord was obliged to answer him with his whip, which soon reduced him to reason.</P>
<P>We began to be tired with our infant, and so put an end to our diversion, and his torture, by sending him cloaths; though some in our company, would have had him gone to Paris in that trim.</P>
<P>In a few days after the frolick was over, he commenced a suit of law against us all, for a robbery; but the judges finding it only a trick of mirth, fined every one of the defendants six livres a piece, and every one to pay his own costs. This enraged the infant the more, and he began to meditate a more pemicious revenge; for now he appeared the ridicule of the whole city, and he could never stir with|out a train of boys at his heels.</P>
<P>The first instance of it was as follows: My servant hav|ing some intrigue on his hands, had made bold with my cloaths to carry it on: and coming home pretty late, was shot through the back with a pistol-ball, just as he was en|tering the college gates. Though it was well meant, the poor fellow escaped with life, yet he lay dangerously ill for
<PB N="164" REF="046409_0162_10215F4B9B585208">
several days. He could give no account of the affair at all, not having seen the person that wounded him. But the accident made me very uneasy, for I was convinced the fa|vour was meant to me. This made me cautious how I ventured out of the college; for it was easy to imagine it was a proof of the infant's resentment, who had left the col|lege upon the loss of his trial.</P>
<P>I now began to repent our confederacy against him, and wrote him a note to assure him of my contrition, with my share of the money we had taken from him. He receiv|ed the cash, and sent me word he heartily forgave me. I|magining him sincere, I ventured into the city, and soon frequented my old rendezvous; but I had so much regard to myself as to get to college betimes.</P>
<P>One night as I was going home, four men in vizar masks rushed out from behind a wall of a house that was build|ing; they all fired upon me, and ran away as soon as they had discharged their pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s. I must confess, at first, fear made me imagine myself no man of this world, but by de|grees getting over my apprehension, I found I had not get any hurt. This accident to me seemed prodigious; for they were all four so near me, that several grains of pow|der struck in my face. But I was brought out of my la|byrinth of thought, when I received the following letter the next morning.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I MUST own myself one of those unfortunate men, that, for want of better employment, receive money as the price of blood. Though this I can say with a clear con|science, I never have yet put my trade in practice. Yes|terday morning I was sent for to the house of Monsieur Gomberville, commonly called the infant, who employed me to take away your life; and that he would be sure of the execution, made one of the four that fired upon you last night; but as I had the ordering of our arms, I took care nothing should be put in them that was huriful. The acquaintance I had with your noble father, mode me the more cautious concerning his son. I beg, in justice to me,
<PB N="165" REF="046409_0163_10215F4E07FD3638">
you would keep your chamber, and cause it to be reported you are dangerously wounded. I need not caution you to be careful of yourself, for the infant's malice seems to me implacable. We never have any words made of these things, because we know how to revenge ourselves; therefore let no one else know the contents of this, and be thankful for your life from</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JAQUES MARRIOT</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>When I had rend the letter, I ordered my servant to bring the bearer before me; where I soon found, by his manner of talking, that a little money would be very ac|ceptable to the sender; and therefore I sent him ten pis|toles, with my humble service, giving him to know that I would exactly comply with the contents.</P>
<P>I began now seriously to think on the danger I had in|considerately drawn upon myself, for an innocent frolick; and that it would be but ill trusting to the infant's resent|ment. I gave out that I was dangerously wounded; and the better to carry it on, I got a surgeon (a friend of mine) to visit me frequently.</P>
<P>When I had kept my chamber long enough for the time of my cure, I ventured abroad, but never without four or five of my friends for a guard, and came home in very good time.</P>
<P>During my confinement, I received letters of condolement from several of my mistresses, and when they heard of my recovery, as many of reproach for not coming to visit them as usual. One in particular, and my favourite fair, was very pressing for a meeting; and her chief reason was to pay her with my presence for the affronts she had sustained from the infant upon my account. I sent her word I would not fail waiting on her the Sunday following after dusk. Ac|cordingly, when the time came, I stole out without any of the college marks on, and arrived safe at my Madona's.</P>
<P>After supper, and two or three bottles of hermitage, we went to bed: and when we had made ourselves as merry as we could in the dark, I addressed myself to sleep. But
<PB N="166" REF="046409_0164_10215F50982B0300">
notwithstanding my willingness to receive the gentle god, he still flew from me, and several hours passed without clo|sing my eyes.</P>
<P>About midnight I thought I heard whispers in the next room, which very much alarmed me; but my fears were trebly increased, when, looking through a chink of the door, I discovered the infant, and four other fellows with masks in their hands spreading saw-dust on the floor, and on the table lay several sacks.</P>
<P>I soon imagined what their preparations meant, therefore consulted my safety, as well as I could, in the confusion of my thoughts.</P>
<P>I went always well armed since the last rencounter, hav|ing two brace of pistols in my pockets, a good cutting sword, and a stilletto. But I was confounded when searching for my cloaths where I had laid them, none could be found. I now began to think of death seriously, and beg pardon sincerely of God for all my sins; for I knew it would be madness to think of escaping naked as I was, without any thing for my defence. In the chaos of my thoughts, I remembered a closet which had a window that looked into the Seine; and though it was three stories from the river, yet as I could swim, I thought it better to trust to provi|dence, by leaping into the water, than to those cut-throats. I stole softly to the window, but to my great consternation, found it too fast for me to open; and by good fortune, in groping about, I found my cloaths. I put them on with a great deal of precipitation, and having prepared my arms resolved not to die alone.</P>
<P>I waited some time before the chamber-door opened. When it was opened, I could perceive them coming in with masks on, and the foremost with a dark lanthorn. I did not think fit to wait till they should discover I was not in the bed, but rushed on the first, and shot him dead on the spot; and in two seconds of a minute, dispatched two more, one with my sword, and the other with one of my pistols; and had made as quick work with the other two, but they fell upon their knees, and begged for mercy, which I granted on condition that one should tie the other, which was read|ily
<PB N="167" REF="046409_0165_10215F545597F058">
complied with; when that was done, I bound the other myself, and coming to secure my false mistress, found her expiring in the bed. She had breath enough left to tell me, she had been caught in her own trap; for designing to poison me in the wine I drank, the servant had mista|ken the bottle, and given it to her.</P>
<P>I asked her the reason of her hatred to me, being, as I remembered, guilty of no fault. She told me, the infant had informed her that I was false to her, which converted her love to the most implacable hatred. I must own this woman was mistress of my heart, and I had several proofs of her sincerity; but she was of a temper composed of fire and fury. She further told me, that I had raised her rage to that height, that she was resolved to put an end to my life herself, not caring to trust her revenge to any hands but her own.</P>
<P>She begged I would forgive her, and immediately expired. I examined my two intended murderers, and found they were servants to the infant, and compelled to what they did; therefore I resolved to pardon them.</P>
<P>I thought once of going to the provost, and giving him a particular account of the action; but one of the fellows in|formed me, he was a near relation of the infant's and had a very great love for him, which made me apprehend his passion would overcome his justice. Therefore I resolved the the next morning to set out for Spain, which I put in prac|tice before day, and gave my man orders to follow me.</P>
<P>I left Paris with this reflection, that from the meanest tri|fling accident, often dreadful effects followed; and a woman once provoked was the most dangerous enemy a man could have.</P>
<P>I met with nothing extraordinary in my voyage to Calais; but when I arrived at Seville, I was informed my father (who was governor of that city) was at his country-house about six leagues off.</P>
<P>Though I was very much fatigued with my journey, I re|solved to wait on him that night. I hired a mule (for I had my servant's cloaths on) and sat out. But my beast be|ing
<PB N="168" REF="046409_0166_10215F55DF917778">
none of the best, tired with me about a league before I came to the villa where my father resided.</P>
<P>I left him in the adjacent village, and pursued my jour|ney on foot. As I was willing to get to my father's house, I made all the speed I could. And though it was very dark, I knew the way perfectly.</P>
<P>I overtook two men in a narrow lane, that called to me, asking why I had stayed so long, and where was Don Lewis.</P>
<P>I fancied there was something of villany going forward by the name of Don Lewis, seeing he was an inveterate enemy of my father's. I did not answer them immediately, which brought them upon me: they soon found their mistake, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me where I was going at that time of night; I told them I was going to Saragoza, to my friends, for I had ser|ved a gentleman in Cadiz, that discharged me for getting his maid with child; and was obliged to walk all night, seeing I had not any money to pay for a lodging. I answered a great many other questions, with the same truth and simplicity. And after talking some time, two more came up to us, and asked the others who they had got with them. They went all together, and, after a little talk, one that seemed to be the superior, came up to me, and told me if I would make one of their enterprise that night, he would not only reward me well, but take me into his service; but if I refused after he had disclosed it to me, they would murder me immediately.</P>
<P>I told them, I would stick at nothing to get bread. Why then, said Sir Gravity, my name is Don Lewis: I have a mental hatred to Ferdinand Aquillio, governor of Serville. I have waited many years for my revenge, but never could get an opportunity to execute it till now. He has received one of my servants into his house as a domestic, who this night will open the door to us, where I shall quench my hatred of him with his blood; and further, to dispatch all fear of resistance, I can assure you there are but two more servants in the house, whom the fellow has made drunk, which shall be ordered so, as if they had murdered their master.</P>
<P>It was well for me that darkness covered the hemisphere,
<PB N="169" REF="046409_0167_10215F585CFA6178">
or the old devil could have discovered the confusion in my countenance. But, notwithstanding my consternation, I told him I should be proud to serve him in this or in any other adventure. Gramercy, said the old one, and here's some|thing to encourage thee, (clapping a handful of dollars into my hand.)</P>
<P>I'll leave you to guess the confusion of my thoughts at this declaration, and I was casting about in my mind how I should prevent this intended villany.</P>
<P>When we arrived at my father's, we found the treach|erous villain waiting for his master. As soon as ever he saw us, he cried softly to Don Lewis, I am glad your hon|our is come; but Don Ferdinand is in his closet, and does not intend to go to bed to-night, because he is to be at Seville early in the morning, and he has shut his closet|door. Why then, said Don Lewis, we'll break it open. But, returned the servant, he has arms always ready in his closet, and I fear the enterprize will be a little difficult, for he's a tough old blade.</P>
<P>Upon this account a small pause ensued, which gave me leisure to think, and to the old one I uttered my thoughts.</P>
<P>Sir, said I, submit this business to me, and I'll inform you how I design to execute it. Your servant shall ac|company me to the door of his closet, and knock, and as soon as ever he opens it, I'll <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a good account of the old gentleman.</P>
<P>Thou counsellest well, replied the old Don, and I'll re|ward thee accordingly, when the work is done. And I shall deserve it, thought I to myself, if my intention succeeds.</P>
<P>Upon this resolve we went into the house, and this fel|low conducted me up stairs very softly. The closet was at the end of a large room, the door of which I bolted in the inside with my one hand, and plunged my poinard to the heart of the fellow with the other, who dropped dead at my feet. At the noise he made in falling, my father cried out, Who is there? and rushed out of his closet, with a pistol in his hand. I replied, 'Tis I, your son.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="046409_0168_10215F59EE6D5C58">
You may imagine the surprise my father was in at this sudden appearance, and to see one of his servants weltering in his blood, and dead before me. Sir, said I, banish your surprise, and go with me into your closet, where I will in|form you of this sudden and unlooked-for appearance; and must farther add, that the hand of Providence, by me, has saved you from death.</P>
<P>My father followed me into his study, without speaking; where I declared to him in as few words as the time would permit, all that had befallen me that night; and we soon came to a resolution what to do.</P>
<P>We took each of us a blunderbuss, with a brace of pis|tols, went down the back stairs, and came in upon them, a way they little expected. I came first into the hall, as we had concerted.</P>
<P>As soon as the old wretch saw me, he cried, Well, my lad, hast thou dispatched the villain? Yes, Sir, said I, and have dragged him down that you may behold what I have done. When he heard that, he gave a leap for joy, and came running forward to view the pleasing fight. But words cannot express his looks, when he saw my father con|fronting him with a blunderbuss in his hand. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ood mo|tionless, as if he had been turned to stone.</P>
<P>The other three endeavoured to make their escape, but I discharged my blunderbuss, and stopt two of them with my hasty messengers. The report of my piece made Don Lewis fall down, as imagining himself slain; the third person find|ing it impossible to escape, became desperate, and, like a flag at bay, defied us. He pulled out a stilletto, and ran upon me like an angry lion, and, notwithstanding I shot him in the breast with a brace of balls, wounded me in three several places; I grappling with him, we came down to|gether upon the body of Don Lewis, who with our weight, began to cry out; and that moment had been the last of my life, if my father had not ran to my assistance, and with his sword nail'd my antagonist to the pavement.</P>
<P>The report of our fire-arms had wakened the two drunk|en servants of my father's who came half frightened out of
<PB N="171" REF="046409_0169_10215F5E24BDF5C8">
their senses. By this time Don Lewis had recovered him|self, and seeing death before him, fell down upon his knees, and implored my father's mercy.</P>
<P>Thou base man! replied my father, how canst thou ex|pect to live after thy barbarous attempt upon his life that never wronged thee? He told him he did not expect to be forgiven, only to be allowed a priest, and confession, and be would die with a hearty penitence for his sins.</P>
<P>Wretch! cried my father, thou may'st see how Heaven abhors thy fact, by blasting your design. This man thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eest before thee, whom thou didst employ in thy black de|sign, is my own son, whose coming hither was like an an|gel sent from heaven to my assistance. I see, returned the Don, the seal of Providence is upon you, and I heartily repent the crime I intended to commit; and if you will forgive me, and forget what is past, I'll esteem you as the saver of my life; and to unite our friendship, I'll match my daughter with a noble dowry to this your son, and may they ever live happy.</P>
<P>My father was too much of a gentleman, to murder in cold blood, though he had sufficient excuse on his side if he had done it. On the other hand, his daughter was a very great fortune, even beyond his hopes.</P>
<P>After some small pause, he made him this reply, Sir, you know within yourself, that you have forfeited your life by the law, in so basely attempting mine; but as I can forgive any injury designed me; if you perform your first promise I am resolved to forgive all that's past. Sir, replied the other, (transported with joy) I am so much obliged to you for my life, that I will not stir out of your house, till I have signed articles of agreement; and I must farther add, that nothing sets my shame more before my eyes, than this your goodness.</P>
<P>My father begged he would take a particular care how he gave way to hatred; which, by the way, not only com|menced in my father's getting the better of him in a law suit, and was heightened by the King's conferring on him
<PB N="172" REF="046409_0170_10215F5FAF68A860">
the honour of the government of Seville, which Don Lewis had some hopes of.</P>
<P>We took care the next day to let the country know that those fellows that were killed, had attempted to rob our house, but we having timely notice had prevented them by their deaths.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was as good as his word, for articles of agreement were drawn up between them, and I had leave to visit the lady when I thought fit. But I was obliged to go back to Seville, and put myself in an equipage suit|able to the occasion, and Don Lewis followed after with his daughter.</P>
<P>I must confess I was charmed with her person at the first interview; and the day was fixed for the nuptials, which rejoiced the whole city of Seville, that two of the noblest houses were going to put an end to their enmity.</P>
<P>I took the privilege of an intended husband in my vis|its to my designed bride, and in her conversation found she had no aversion for me, (at least I thought so,) and I prom|ised myself the utmost felicity in her enjoyment.</P>
<P>One morning about a week before the intended wedding, I came early to wait on her, but was informed she was not come out of her chamber: therefore I resolved to take a walk in the great piazza of the city, to give her time to dress herself; but as I was going out, I observed my mis|tress's maid conferring with a country fellow: the sight of me, I observed, gave the woman some confusion. My heart told me I was concerned in their interview, therefore I went to the corner of the street, and waited till their dialogue was over; which did not keep me long, for the fellow soon parted with the woman, and went out of the gate that leads to Cordova.</P>
<P>I had my man with me, whom I acquainted with my fears, ordering him to dog the fellow, and get out of him, by fair means or foul, his business at Don Lewis's house, and I would follow him on horseback.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="046409_0171_10215F6141828150">
Away ran my man, and I soon got my horse, and over|took them about a league and a half from Seville.</P>
<P>When my man got sight of me, I observed he took a little basket from the countryman, and ran away over the fields with it. I fancied by that he had succeeded in his commission, so turned my horse and followed him.</P>
<P>When I had overtaken him, we went behind a tuft of trees, a little out of the road, where he told me he had made the fellow believe he was sent by Teresa (the name of the maid he was conferring with) to give him notice that he would be pursued by a cavalier, and forced to deliver what he had received from her, and perhaps be in danger of losing his life; and that he had orders to consult with him for his safety.</P>
<P>The countryman, being none of the wisest, soon discovered the whole affair to my man, and at sight of me, delivered the basket to him&punc; and ran to a publick house in the next village, to wait till he could get clear of me, where my man was to bring him his basket again. In the basket were four melons, and in one of them we found a letter very artificially put up, which I took out, and with terror of mind read the contents, which were as follows:</P>

my providential stars that guided me to this black secret, be|fore the priest had joined our hands. And though a Span|iard, my resentment did not rise to jealousy, but my fancy ran upon the enjoyment of this false fair one, without the marriage chain. And what prompted me the more to it, was a postscript to her letter, wherein she bade him come in his usual disguise, and in the dark. In order to the ac|complishment of my design, I went into a neighbouring house, and wrote the following letter, which was put in the melon in the room of the other.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Now all the hopes I had were, that the fellow knew what disguise this amorous spark wore, and where was the place of rendezvous.</P>
<P>I left it all to my servant, who had cunning enough to outwit twenty of the countryman. After I had delivered him his commission, I went back to Seville, full of hopes and fears; and in two hours my man arrived&punc; he gave me a description of his converse with the countryman, (which was diverting enough) and how happy they were in esca|ping my hands.</P>
<P>He informed me, the amorous gallant came disguised so the habit of a peasant, and was admitted through the back garden of Don Lewis's house by the maid, who always at|tended the hour and conveyed him to her apartment in the dark; which was according to my wish, and by description of the spark's person, we were not unlike as to proportion or age, and darkness would conceal the rest.</P>
<P>I soon provided myself of the habit I was to wear, and
<PB N="175" REF="046409_0173_10215F672F8EB690">
impatiently expected the coming hour, which came at last, though the intervening ones seemed the longest of my life.</P>
<P>I did not wait long, before I was admitted by the too faithful confident. We went over the garden to a small room at the entrance of the house, where I soon discovered my false fair one, though in the dark. She was undressed and disincumbered of every let to enjoyment. I found, by her eger kisses and embraces, there was no parleying re|quired; so I c'en fell to and fed very heartily: my part|ner in pleasure seemed to like what was prepared for her; and before we parted gave me to understand I had done wonders, and much beyond her expectation.</P>
<P>When we had dallied away about four hours in our feast|ing, the maid came to tell me it was time to part, which we did, after snatching another morsel.</P>
<P>I went immediately home, was soon in bed, and had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> want of any provocative to sleep.</P>
<P>When I rose in the morning, I began to weigh maturely the last night's adventure; but could come to no resolu|tion as to the forming my behaviour to my false mistress but I resolved to be determined by hers.</P>
<P>I went to visit her about noon, and found her more than ordinary civil to me.</P>
<P>In short, I was so charmed with the sight of her, that I resolved to give her another visit in my disguise, the same&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ght; and all I had to do was to be first at the place.</P>
<P>When the time came, my conductress was ready, as be|ore; but, going softly in, she clapt to the door a little too hastily, and fastened my coat in it: and, to give me the more uneasiness, she the same moment dropt the key out of her hand; and though I could see where it lay, yet I could not stoop for it, because my coat was secured in the door&punc;</P>
<P>After groping about some time, she took it up, and opened the door to release her prisoner; but on the very instant my rival appeared, and, finding himself there before he came, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in and fastened upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="046409_0174_10215F6A4362FD38">
The maid, at the sight of the two Sofias, clapt to the door in a fright, and ran screaming away; so we had the happiness to be locked in the garden together. But however, to make the best of a bad market, (as the saying is) I got my rival down, and belaboured him with my fists; for, as good fortune would have it, we had neither of us any of|fensive weapons.</P>
<P>The noise of the maid, and our bustling, alarmed an Eng|lish mastiff, that was watchman to the house, who, without saying, By your leave, had the impudence to fasten upon my rival by the arm, and worry him very handsomely. But, notwithstanding my reason to the contrary, I took pity on him, and, by force of arms, destroyed the dog; that is, I held him so fast about the throat with my hands, that his last breath flew away in a huff.</P>
<P>My disguised spark seeing himself so unexpectedly relieved, gave me thanks for his safety: and as soon as ever he spoke, (for we had been sullen before, neither of us having opened our lips) I knew him by his tongue to be one of my particular acquaintance.</P>
<P>Why, how now, Don Juan! said I, how came you thus disguised? Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, replied the Don, I ought to ask you the same thing. With several questions and answers, we came to a right understanding. If I had known, said he, your pretensions here, I should never have made any attempt to your pre|judice. Come, come, said I, 'tis very well as it is. So we turned that to mirth and ridicule, which perhaps others of our nation would have turned to blood Our next thing was to make our escape, for the whole house was alarmed, and coming upon us with their domestic weapons, such as pokers, spits, fire-shovels, &amp;c. My companion led me into a place in the garden where the wall was something lower than any where else; and just as we had gained the ascent, we per|ceived a man mounting from the other side; but my friend did him the favour to tumble him down again; he quickly got up, and ran upon him most furiously with his poinard, and gave him several stabs; but my friend closed with him, wrested his weapon from him, and stabbed him to the heart.</P>
<P>As soon as he was sped, we made off; but did not go
<PB N="177" REF="046409_0175_10215F6CDA415428">
far before my companion dropt down dead of his wounds. I was very much grieved at this accident, but made the best of my way home, for fear I should come into trouble about it, if I was caught near the dead bodies.</P>
<P>I went to bed, but very much perplexed in mind, and had no rest all night. But what was my grief in the morning, when my servant brought me word that my father and Don Juan my friend were found murdered in the habits of peasants, under Don Lewis's garden-wall. The relation deprived me of the use of speech for some time, and my reason forsook me. I was more than once going to put an end to my life, and had certainly done it, if I had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> been prevented by my faithful servant. But when my reason returned again, I began to think of the adventure with some calmness; for though I had all the grief imaginable for the loss of so good a father, yet I was of temper not to grieve long at any thing; and then the fortune I thought myself master of, appeared so lovely to me, that it soon dried up my tears.</P>
<P>The city imagined my father came by his death through Don Lewis's means, as remembering the ancient enmity of the two houses: and being found so near his house, strength|ened the opinion of every body: and I was the only per|son satisfied to the contrary.</P>
<P>The servants that brought in my father's body gave me several papers found in his pockets; among which were two letters that partly let me into the truth of this unhappy ad|venture. The first was to this purpose:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>YOUR generosity has prevailed, and I can no longer with|stand your offers, (on the condition, as you promise in your last, that you will break off the match between your son and my lady.) You must provide yourself of a peasant's habit, and to-morrow I will send you a note to instruct you farther.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Yours, &amp;c.</HI> TERESA,</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="178" REF="046409_0176_10215F6FEB3E82C8">
The second was as follows:</P>
<Q><P><HI>BE at the west end of the garden at one in the morn|ing, and ascend a ladder of rope you will find there, and bring it over with you: near the corner you'll per|ceive an arbour, go in there, and wait till I come to conduct you to your wishes. I'll take care nothing shall be in your way to interrupt your privacy; and be sure you be careful of your tongue, for if you speak, we shall be both undone.</HI></P></Q>
<P>My thoughts were in the utmost confusion about the un|ravelling of this fatal affair; and running over in my ima|gination my past conversations with my father, I remembered in our last, he told me, he thought it a little of the soon|est for me to marry: and that it would be more for my interest to delay our nuptials: and, perhaps, said he, I may give you sufficient reasons for the contrary. Whatever his reasons were, I little thought of the true one.</P>
<P>I sent a letter to the maid of my false mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ss, but she fearing she should be found out (as she really was) absconded.</P>
<P>Don Lewis sent to condole with me in my great loss; but I could perceive it gave him some satisfaction, that I was in actual possession of that estate, which I had only hopes of in the life of my father. His visit was but short, yet I thought it too long; for as I had no design of marry|ing the daughter, I was very willing to drop my acquaint|ance with the father. Though I gave him hopes, when decency would permit, I would not fail in my addresses to his daughter.</P>
<P>After the interment of my father. I began to examine his affairs, and was not very well pleased to find the best part of his estate mortgaged for twelve years to several per|sons; and, instead of finding myself worth twenty thousand crowns a year, soon found I was not worth the sixth part.</P>
<P>It was agreed, that my father was very profuse in his way
<PB N="179" REF="046409_0177_10215F721FA77C30">
of living, always keeping open house; yet it was every body's opinion he did not expend half his income.</P>
<P>I sometimes imagined there was some underhand dealing in the affair, but it was past my finding out: I therefore took an odd resolution. I determined with myself to un|dergo a voluntary banishment, till the term of years on the mortgage was expired.</P>
<P>I made a visit to Don Lewis, and told him my resolves, and my reasons for it, which he could not but applaud; for it was easy enough to perceive interest was the jack he aimed at. He did not press me to see his daughter, nor I him; but after assurance of remembrancing on both sides, we parted.</P>
<P>I must own, my soul longed for another taste of the de|licious banquet; and I hope you will excuse me when I own to you, my passion could not be called love; but as I found it impracticable, I made myself as easy as I could.</P>
<P>In a few weeks I had finished my affairs, and waited for the sailing of the West-India fleet, resolving for the city of Mexico, where I had an uncle very rich, who had often expressed in his letters to my father the great desire he had to see me.</P>
<P>I had raised out of the ruins of my father's fortune six thou|sand crowns, without so much as touching any of his plate, or furniture; the care of those things with all my writings, I trusted with a near kinsman, superior of a monastery in the city.</P>
<P>One day, going about two leagues out of the town, my horse's girth broke, which obliged me so alight at a saddler's to have it made good. The man asked me if I would not take a walk in the garden while he was doing his work, which I accordingly did.</P>
<P>At the end of the walk was a pretty arbour, and in it sat a woman reading; who, at first sight of me, gave a great shriek, and was running out; but I stopped her, and beg|ging pardon for disturbing her, told her I would retire and
<PB N="180" REF="046409_0178_10215F73A8AA4F10">
leave her alone. But upon finding it was Teresa, maid to my quondam mistress, I resolved to stay with her, that I might know something of my father's affair.</P>
<P>She appeared confounded at the sight of me, as imagining I had come on purpose to apprehend her, but I soon unde|ceived her, and with a little soothing language, and a couple of pistoles, she disposed herself to give me all the informa|tion she could.</P>
<P>Sir, said she, I hope you will pardon me, for what I did was purely by influence of gold.</P>
<P>Your father declared to me, that at first sight of my mis|tress, his heart and reason forsook him; and often informed me that if he could not enjoy her, he should be obliged to put an end to his misery by death. I often laid before him the injury he would do to you his son, but he as often de|clared he would break off the match between you; for he was well assured you had no very violent inclination for her, and there were other women in Seville, of as great fortune as my mistress, that would be proud of his alliance.</P>
<P>The many rich presents he made me, overcame my hones|ty; and that unfortunate night that brought him his death, was to have compleated his happiness. But, said she, (after some pause) I am very much at a loss to find out one thing. What's that, madam? said I, Why Sir, returned Mado|na, since I know how matters stand between you and my mis|tress, I shall give you to understand, that you are not the favoured lover; and that another gentleman revelled in those delights which you, perhaps, ought to have the whole possession of; and that was the reason I was so willing to comply with your father, for I had intended to introduce him in the habit of the said gentleman, unknown to my mistress, and had pro|vided a story accordingly. For as soon as ever the gentle|man was gone, your father should have taken his place in the same disguise; and I intended to impose on my mistress, that her lover was returned to take another farewell of her. And this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was easy to be carried on, seeing they were obliged to silence, old Don Lewis lodging in the next room. But what amazes me, (as I was saying) opening the door to let my mistress lover in, another in the same disguise rushed
<PB N="181" REF="046409_0179_10215F756BBCD2B8">
in upon me, which I am sure was not your father. I soon cleared up this affair with her, and let her know how I had supplanted my rival.</P>
<P>She seemed vary much surprized at the unravelling of this secret, but was very glad she had nothing to apprehend from my resentment, seeing that was the chief cause of leaving her mistress, as imagining I should find the latter she had sent him. And upon this she resolved to go to her mistress again, for she heard every day from the family, and knew how matters stood; and that her mistress wanted her, that they might condole together for the loss of Don Juan her old spark. But she declared she was not very sorry for his loss, for money came very hard from him; And you know, Sir, said she, it is our business to make hay while the sun shines.</P>
<P>Madam, said I, since I know what you like best, if you'll pursue my intrigue, twenty pistoles are at your service. In|deed, Sir, returned madam, it must be something very ex|traordinary that I shall refuse for such a sum. Why then I'll let you into my plot, said I; you shall inform your mistress that Don Juan is not dead, as was reported; but after a te|dious and dangerous illness, was recovered to a miracle, but concealed his revival, being under some apprehension of an|swering for the life of my father.</P>
<P>Sir, said she, I like your plot so well that I'll answer for the success of it, and I'll go about it instantly, for I long to be fingering the gold. Why then, said I, you shall finger it before-hand, and when the business is done, I'll dou|ble the sum. She was mightily pleased with the amend|ment to the bargain; and the third night after was conclu|ded on for the time, when I was to attend as before.</P>
<P>I took leave of Teresa, and pursued my journey, made merry with my friends, and returned.</P>
<P>At length the happy moment came that I so long expect|ed. My mercenary confident was ready; I entered, and once more took possession of all my treasure; and as I thought it would be the last time, was profuse enough. My lady seemed very well pleased with my night's work, and in plain terms told me so.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="046409_0180_10215F786EEFA3E8">
I had prepared a letter, in which I had disclosed every thing. When our loving affair was over, she asked me softly how I was engaged&punc; in that adventure. I told her as softly as I could, that I knew she would be inquisitive, and talking being dangerous, I had brought the account in writing, which I put into her hand, and with some regret took my leave; for the next day was designed for our embarkation. As I walked over the garden, I asked Teresa how long the amour had been between Don Juan and her lady; she told me about two years, and this was the commencement.</P>
<P>Don Juan, said she, (whose country-house lay about two leagues from my master's) was set upon by thieves, and dan|gerously wounded; and there had lost his life, if Don Lewis had not, very fortunately for him, come that way attended, and drove off the thieves. Don Juan was so very much hurt, that it was not thought safe to carry him home; therefore my master ordered him to his house, where his wounds kept him a great while. When he had recovered strength enough to walk, he usually employed his time in the garden, where my lady often seeing him, fell desperately in love with him. She made me the confident of her infant passion, and I be|ing a very proper person to be trusted with such secrets, ad|vised her to let the Don see her, which we contrived thus:</P>
<P>She was to go into an arbour at the further end of the garden, (where I had observed Don Juan sat every day) and pretend to be asleep. She took all the care that was ne|cessary in her dress, and did as I directed her. It succeeded to her wish; for the Don at the sight of her, imagining her an earthly goddess, kneeled and kissed her hand. She seemed to wake in a pretended fright, but it was not long before they came to a right understanding.</P>
<P>That place was made the rendezvous of the lovers, when opportunity would permit; but he recovering, (though he pre|tended a weakness for some time) was obliged to take his leave of our house; though in the father's absence, they found op|portunity to satisfy their loves; and when they resided in town, he continued his visits in the disguise of a countryman, which he used to send to my lady with presents of fruit, and by that means they received letters from each other.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="046409_0181_10214542546AAF40">
When she had finished her short relation, I gave her the twenty pistoles I promised her, and took my leave. She seemed to be in some confusion about managing it with her mistress, for she would certainly find her out, she said, when she would be confirmed of Don Juan's death; but she comforted herself with telling me that her mistress durst not disclose it to any body, for fear of betraying herself. But poor Teresa little thought her mistress would find it out so soon as the next morning, when she had read my letter that I put into her hand when with her.</P>
<P>The next day, I ordered my equipage on board our ship, which lay at Cadiz, and followed myself; but the wind chop|ping about, hindered our setting sail. I then repented the leaving my letter with my mistress, for by the help of my money with Teresa, I might have made another meal with her.</P>
<P>I did not think it prudent to go on shore, fearing her re|sentment might form some designs on my life, I therefore con|tented myself on board, till the wind should prove fair for sailing. As I was reading in my cabin one day alone, my servant brought me a letter; The content were these:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>NOBLE SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>UNDERSTANDING you are bound for Mexico, the place of my birth, I shall think it the greatest honour in the world, if you please to take me into your protection. My father was a rich merchant of that city, who, go|ing to another world, has left me a considerable estate in this. Those persons who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d the care of my educa|tion here, seem to have designs against my fortune; there|fore I have made my escape from them, but must return to my betrayers, if you have not the goodness to be my guardian to Mexico, where I shall return the obligation you shall please to lay me under, in being my protector.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>I asked my man, who brought the letter, and he told me a young negro. I bid him bring him in. I asked him several questions, and found him ready with his answers. He informed me, that his father, though a negro, was a
<PB N="184" REF="046409_0182_10215E8EF3D8FAD0">
man of substance, and sent him in his infancy to be educa|ted in Seville, and for the rest the letter informed me.</P>
<P>I was mightily pleased with the person of the black gen|tleman, and treated him civilly, with assurance of delivering him safe to his friends in Mexico.</P>
<P>When we were alone, he told me he had a farther se|cret to discover to me, if he was sure of not being inter|rupted. Upon hearing this, I ordered my servant on shore for some necessaries, and informed him we need not fear any interruption for some hours.</P>
<P>After a long pause, and casting his eyes on the ground, he began thus:</P>
<P>This veil of night would not hide my blushes, if I were not convinced in your knowledge of my frailty. But if you'll consider my youth, climate, and opportunity, you'll al|low few of my sex could withstand the temptation. Be not surprised to find in this disguise the daughter of Don Lewis, who is so far subject to the caprice of love, as to disclose to you the inmost secret of her heart.</P>
<P>The letter you left with me, produced a contrary effect than I believe you imagined; and, instead of rage and in|dignation taking possession of my breast, a foster passion stole in, and I felt all the tenderness imaginable for Don Pedro.</P>
<P>I expect nothing but ill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">age from you for my past con|duct; but if you can believe there is any sincerity in wo|man, after what I have been guilty of. I am assured you may depend on what I say, that no other object shall share my heart with you. I do not mean the tie of wedlock, but if you will accept of me as I am. I'll be as subser|vient to your commands as your meanest slave.</P>
<P>I was so confounded, between pleasure and amazement, that I imagined all I heard and saw was a dream; but, be|ing sweetly convinced of the reality. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid all my passion could suggest in return, not giving myself time to consider of the oddness of the accident: 'Twas sufficient I had in possession all that was lovely in woman in my imagination;
<PB N="185" REF="046409_0183_10215F7F5096E320">
and I had no other thought, but how to keep her from the knowledge of her father on shore, and the sailors on board, for we did not know when we should set sail.</P>
<P>My mistress told me, if she had not succeeded with me, she resolved for a nunnery, but since we were reconciled, she had laid by all thoughts of the habit. She made her escape from her father's without the assistance or knowledge of any but Teresa. But what favoured her escape was the absence of her father for ten days in the country; yet she s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ared, when he came home again, he would fright Teresa into confession, or by promises get it out of her; for that she was mercenary enough to sell any thing she had to the best bidder. To prevent which, we agreed to dress in the habit of a man, and let her wear her own complexion.</P>
<P>Accordingly we went both on shore at Cadiz, and soon equipt ourselves with what we wanted, and on board I brought my spark as a relation of mine, that I had a mind to run his fortune with me. The next day the wind proving very favourable, we set sail and left our apprehensions behind us.</P>
<P>I was obliged to let my servant into the secret, that I might have it kept so; well knowing if he had discovered it himself, it had not been a secret long, though the fellow was very faithful to any secret that was trusted to him.</P>
<P>We touched at the Madeira islands, passed the Pike of Teneriff, got over the line, ducked our men as usual, and met with no extraordinary accident; but in fifty-three days arrived safe at the city of Sancta Domingo, (or St. Dom|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) the capital city of the island Hispaniola.</P>
<P>I was very well pleased to find so delightful a place as this was, after the fatigue of our voyage. My mistress and I took us a lodging at a good-natured Spaniard's, that treated us very well for our money.</P>
<P>Here my lady told me, she felt the effects of our famil|iarity. I endeavoured to persuade her I had no hand in it; but she insisted upon it that the deed was done by me, and gave me some proofs to believe it.</P>
<P>I was very much concerned to find means to hide it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">om
<PB N="186" REF="046409_0184_10215F80F7021B88">
the house; for she began to have those qualms which attend that natural distemper; and by the beauty of her face, I feared her sex might soon be distinguished.</P>
<P>I kept her from the sight of our ship's crew in the voy|age, she always staying in the cabin; and it was very dan|gerous to discover a fine woman in this part of the world, because there are few that are handsome.</P>
<P>I was upon thorns till our departure from Mexico; but the fleet staying longer than I expected, I took a ramble to the most noted places in the island: and since I un|derstand by you flory you never were there, I'll give you a short description of it.</P>
<P>Hispaniola is seated from seventeen degrees to nineteen de|grees latitude, in length about one hundred and twenty leagues, and breadth (about the middle part) fifty. The air much the fame for heat as at Seville in Spain; the fruits deli|cious, and some peculiar to the place.</P>
<P>The capital city is St. Domingo, which gives a delight|ful prospect from the fields about it, being mixed with plea|sant gardens and rivers.</P>
<P>Here the governor of the island resides, and here are kept all their offices, and courts of judicature, and it is likewise the store-house to the whole island.</P>
<P>There are two cities more, St. Jago and Neustra Sermon de alta Gracia; the last of which is to the south, and is famous for the best chocolate in the world.</P>
<P>The cathedral of St. Domingo is a handsome pile of build|ings, and the other churches are answerable to the grandeur of the inhabitants, whose very artisans are wealthy.</P>
<P>The friars live as luxurious here as in any other part of the world, and follow the steps of their brethren in chasing the noblest situations.</P>
<P>This island was discovered by Columbus in the year 1498, and kept in the hands of the Spaniards ever since that time;
<PB N="187" REF="046409_0185_10215F851CC76A98">
while most of their other acquisitions are fallen to the Eng|lish, French, and Dutch.</P>
<P>Though the French have some plantations in the island at present, yet they were of their own acquiring, and not ta|ken from the Spaniards; and being chiefly hunters, and not very rich, the Spaniards make no attempt upon them.</P>
<P>No island can boast of more convenient ports than this, and every port disembogues fine rivers (stored with palata|ble fis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">) into the sea; but then to qualify that blessing, they are very much infested with alligators and crocodiles. I saw one lying on the shore side like a log of wood, and as a buffalo came there to drink, he sprung upon him, drag|ged him to the bottom, and there devoured him; though they are easily to be avoided, from the aromatick smell that comes from their skin.</P>
<P>I was much surprised to find in most houses, serpents in|stead of cats, that were greater enemies to rats and mice; but what was more pleasing, they were not the least offen|sive, having no venom on them. But then they will often play the fox with the poultry, and destroy many of them, unless narrowly watched.</P>
<P>The Scolopendria of the Greeks is found here, and very large scorpions; but by Divine Providence, neither of them are hurtful.</P>
<P>I shall not trouble you with any farther account of this island, because there is not any thing to be found there but what is upon the continent, unless some particular herbs; and as I am no botanist, I shall not take any notice of them.</P>
<P>The time came at last for our embarking for Vera Cruz, in order to go to Mexico, and I left St. Domingo with some regret; as imagining I should not meet with any other place in America so pleasant.</P>
<P>During our voyage, my mistress was mightily disordered.</P>
<P>We embarked for Vera Cruz, where we arrived without any accident; and having no business there, we sat out by
<PB N="188" REF="046409_0186_10215F86A634CEB8">
land for Mexico, and got safe there. But enquiring for my uncle, I was informed he was gone to reside at Lima, the capital city of Peru. My concern was the more, in that I feared I should not meet with proper accommodation at Mexico, for want of him, in the affair of my mistress; for her condition would not bear the fatigue of anoth|er removal.</P>
<P>I was entertained in the house of a near friend of my un|cle's and one who kept a correspondence with him; he was very civil to me, and of a freer disposition than generally the Spaniards are; but he had the same vanity as all the old Christians have, who pride themselves very much upon it. I let him into the secret of my lady, and her condition; and by the help of his wife, we made her re-assume her proper dress. But we kept her private.</P>
<P>The time of her delivery came, and the product proved a lusty boy, who staid among us three weeks, and then left us. I had no scruples about being the father, for it was plain enough to be seen, it being my picture in miniature. My mistress continued very weak, longer than the usual time: and I being alone with her one day, she told me she was under some apprehensions concerning our landlord, Don Ma|nuel, who had made her secretly many large offers, and the nurse was his emmissary. I told her I had the same pro|posals from his wife; and though the woman was not dis|agreeable, nay, she might pass for a beauty, where women were so scarce, yet I could not find any tenderness for her in my heart.</P>
<P>After many arguments between us, a thought came into me head, which I hoped would produce some mirth among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: I desired my mistress to give Don Manuel some small encouragement, and leave the rest to me.</P>
<P>My landlord soon found an opportunity, through my means, to see my mistress. She followed my advice, and trans|ported the Don out of his senses; his joy was not to be contained, he forgot the gravity of a Spaniard, and capered about like a French dancing-master. When I had learnt all their discourse from my mistress, I begged her to continue her good numour to him, and promise him meeting that
<PB N="189" REF="046409_0187_10215F890EA34C98">
day se'ennight in the summer-house of the garden. She did as I directed.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I took my opportunity to confabulate with the wife, and gave her directions, the night appointed to go to the same summer-house, but to avoid speech, see|ing it was over the water, and men were continually pass|ing to and fro. The good woman was as much overjoyed as her husband; and the better to carry on my design I gave it out that I was to go with some gentlemen a hunt|ing the buffalo for two or three days, I desired my land|lord (a title I had given him out of mirth) to take care of my wise in my absence. I told my good landlady this was a contrivance of mine, that we might not be suspected.</P>
<P>My mistress had made just the same agreement with the Don. The time came, and the good man and woman were left to worry one another with their extraordinary passion.</P>
<P>The next day at dinner, (for we generally eat together) Don Manuel cast many a sheep's eye at my wife, and his good lady at me.</P>
<P>The same day, as I was reading in the garden, Madona came to me, and in bitter terms of reproach gave me much ill language; and told me I had betrayed her to her hus|band basely, by giving him the ring she gave me la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> night. I found that she had made a present to her husband of a ring, taking him for me, and she had observed it upon his finger. She made so many speeches about it, that at last I was compelled to tell her the whole truth, to get rid of her tiresome passion&punc; but I soon repented of my declaration; for she flew upon me, and with her nails played the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at with my face; and I had much ado to disengage myself from her. So furious does a disappointed passion make a woman.</P>
<P>Her confounded temper made me resolve to leave Mex|ico. The husband began to suspect something of the affair; but his imagination, that he had the company of my wife in the summer-house, curbed his resentment.</P>
<P>The woman's rage was unsurmountable, and it was not in my power to bring her to temper: therefore I chose to
<PB N="190" REF="046409_0188_1021600A44DE8560">
avoid her as much as possible. As I was at supper with my mistress, some few days after the accident happened, she told me, she had received a present of cordial-water from Don Manuel's wise. Now I had not told her of Mado|na's resentment, because I imagined it might make her un|easy: but as soon as I heard of the present, something struck my mind there was something uncommon in it; I there|fore desired my mistress not to drink any of it. Lord, said she, my dear, I have already, and desire you would taste it too, for it is the pleasantest liquor I ever drank in my life.</P>
<P>I was mightily disturbed at it, and in two hours discovered the fatal effects.</P>
<P>My mistress began to be very much out of order; and not|withstanding all the aid of the physicians, she expired in my arms, and every body agreed she had been poisoned. I had in my fury and ravings, declared to Don Manuel the author of this black deed; and when he went to enquire after her, was informed she went out before night, and was supposed to have gone to the town of St. Jago, on the lake, to one of her relations. Don Manuel sent after her, but she was not to be found. He grieved at the loss of my dear mistress as much as I did; and I dare avow, if he had found his wife, he would have sacrificed her to the manes of my dear mistress.</P>
<P>I was very much grieved for the loss of my mistress, for I had reason to be convinced her passion for me was unfeigned. You may easily imagine, there was no staying for me in the house where this dismal accident happened. But as I was pre|paring to be gone, the Corrigidor sent for me to appear before him, to give him the best account I could of this action. I related to him the whole truth, as I have told it you; only I declared it was my wife I had lost. Don Manuel was seiz|ed, and put him in prison, notwithstanding I insisted upon his innocency; but he proceeded in that manner, seeing it was supposed he was accessory to his wife's escape. But a few days after he was secured, news was brought, that his wife was found murdered in the woods, it was supposed by some Indians, as she was endeavouring to make her escape from the hands of justice.</P>
<P>Thus she met her reward for her barbarous murder of a
<PB N="191" REF="046409_0189_1021454E3171FD50">
woman that never wronged her, though indeed the favour was designed for me.</P>
<P>A few days after this fatal accident, I heard of some mer|chants that designed to cross the continent to the South Sea, with a good guard. I made acquaintance with them, paid my quota to the charge, and set out along with them, leaving be|hind me the hateful city of Mexico, where I had lost the only thing I esteemed on earth. And I must own to you, not|withstanding my philosophy, I never thought of her for some time without the utmost heart-breaking. I have endeavoured indeed, by forcing my temper to mirth, to bury her in re|membrance; and time, with good company, has brought me some assistance; yet nevertheless, I do firmly believe, no wo|man's charms will ever for the future break my rest; for I am satisfied my late mistress made a hole quite through my heart.&mdash;But to pursue my discourse.</P>
<P>We set out, with a guard of fifty Spanish soldiers, for fear of the Indians, who had made it their daily practice to set upon every body that went through the country, if not too strong for them. I need not tell you that Mexico is one of the finest cities in the world, or that it lies upon a lake, and no other passage to it but over three broad causeways from different cities on the land. But what is something extraor|dinary, one part of the lake is brackish, and noisome, with no living creature in it; and the other is fresh, wholesome, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ored with palatable fish. But as there are many exact ac|counts of the continent of America, and its conquest by my noble countryman Hernando Cortes, I shall say no more of it; but I will take the liberty to add, that Caesar and Alex|ander were but pigmy conquerors to him; and every body will be of that opinion, if they will give themselves the trou|ble of reading his history.</P>
<P>We met with no Indians to oppose our passage, and arrived at Segovia, an inland town invironed with rocks, and but meanly built. Some of our company staid there, and I was willing to stay along with them to refresh myself; for 'tis but indif|ferent travelling over rocky mountains, and crossing rivers upon hurdles, that is, pieces of timber lashed together with ropes; and it is sometimes dangerous, though we got over safe with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whole company.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="046409_0190_10214560E0697858">
I staid fifteen days at Segovia, with fifteen of my compan|ions. I was very much surprised at the relation of some of the inhabitants of that place, who told me that about two hundred of your countrymen the year before, (free boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ers) in spite of all opposition, came from the South Sea, to the North, with a very great booty, defeated the Spaniards when ten to one, and posted to all the advantage in the world, sev|eral times. The people of Segovia talk of them as so many devils; and that they were aided by the black gentleman, or it had been an impossibility to have gone through what they did. But it must be confessed, your countrymen despise haz|ards, and laugh at the greatest dangers.</P>
<P>After we had sufficiently refreshed ourselves, we took our leave of Segovia, and pursued our journey to the South Sea, with a guard of Indians, subservient to the Spaniards. And I must own to you, there is not a people in the world more true to their trust, than those confederate Indians that own the do|minion of Spain.</P>
<P>Our journey to St. Fee, was pleasant enough, through a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> level, pleasant country, and we rode upon mules, a beast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sure foot; and our chief diversion was shooting of mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, that played us several comical tricks, running up the trees, and frequently did us the favour to urine in our faces, and some|times something worse.</P>
<P>When we arrived at St. Fee, a small town and port in the South Sea, we had the good fortune of meeting with a vessel ready to sail for Lima. We went immediately on board, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> got clear of the shore that evening.</P>
<P>We arrived at Lima after a voyage of twenty-five days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> landed at Caalo, the port that all the ships of Spain anchor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and one of the finest in the South Sea.</P>
<P>The town is built upon a point of land that runs into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sea. It is very strongly fortified, and well garrisoned, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my servant to my uncle at Lima, to acquaint him that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> coming to wait on him the next day; but my servant re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed in four hours, with my uncle's coach, who informed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that he was impatient till he saw me. My uncle was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the civil courts, and a man in very great power. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="193" REF="046409_0191_10215F8B8C1F4580">
his Major Domo to wait on me, with this excuse, that he had come himself, but that he was afflicted with the gout. I only staid till I had put on other cloaths, and immediately after, went in the coach with Major Domo, and arrived at my un|cle's just within night. He was very well pleased to see me, and caressed me in an extraordinary manner. But I was some|thing surprised to find that he had resolved for Spain within a month, there to end his days.</P>
<P>I told him the story of my father's unhappy fate, only con|cealing his love to Donna Elvira. He was very much shock|ed at the news, owning to me his chief reason of going to Spain, was to have the happiness of living together. I then told him, I supposed as that could not be, that he would al|ter his resolution, and think no more of his voyage: But he answered, most of his effects were gone for Spain two months before, and that he must of necessity follow.</P>
<P>I gave him to understand, that it was not in my power to wait upon him. He took a great deal of pains to persuade me to it, but when he found it was to no purpose, he told me, since I was not to be prevailed upon, he would leave me master of a small fortune at Lima.</P>
<P>During his stay, he introduced me to most of the best fam|ilies in the city, and the viceroy was pleased to show me good countenance, and promised my uncle to provide for me.</P>
<P>When the time came of his embarking for Spain, I waited on him on board, where we took leave, though not with dry eyes; and I have repented many times that I did not ac|company him. But we must submit to fate; and what is allotted us by fortune will come.</P>
<P>He left me master of a well furnished house, and a planta|tion, whose income would provide every thing necessity requi|red in the middle station of life, with a promise that at his death I should inherit the remainder of his estate; for he was a single man, and had no nearer relation than myself.</P>
<P>I took all the pleasure the place would afford: and to say the truth, there was no want of any thing as Lima, except the conversation of the female sex; though I must freely con|fess, I did not always want that.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="046409_0192_10215F901970B9D0">
The viceroy proved very kind to me, but death taking him away suddenly, I mightily grieved his loss, as indeed I had rea|son; for the person that succeeded him, proved the reverse. He made a general remove of all the officers the deceased had put in posts, and among the rest I was one of the sufferers; and farther, upon all occasions he made it his business to slight me, and often affronted me so grossly, that nothing but his dignity skreened him from my resentment: and many other people in power, (as the injudicious generally copy the frail|ties of their superiors, and neglect their virtues) treated me in the same manner; but I was resolved not to bear it.</P>
<P>One day as I was coming from my planlation upon my mule, attended only with my old servant, I met a nephew of the viceroy's in his chaise, in a narrow road, and not being willing to give way to him, we were both at a stand; which so enraged the cholerick gentleman, that he flew out of his vehicle, and ran his spado into the belly of my mule, which dropped down dead.</P>
<P>I did not want so much provocation to raise my choler, there|fore I drew upon him, and left him in the same condition with my beast, grovelling upon the sand. He had several people that attended him, who rushed upon me and my man, overpowered us, and dragged us immediately to the viceroy's palace; who, being glad of any pretence to wreak his ill|nature upon me, condemned me to Baldivia for life, in spite of the intercession of those few friends I had.</P>
<P>It was in vain to complain of this hard trick of fortune; and the more to plague me, he left orders that I should be disposed of to Don Sancho Ramirez, a relation of his; the wretch that I have sufficiently revenged myself of, and, in part, of the inhumane viceroy; for they were partners in trade.</P>
<P>Ramirez used to put me upon the most slavish business, but as I had money I usually bought it off; for I received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">early my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">state from Lima.

notwithstanding my condition, was not ashamed of my acquaint|ance, and often told me the torments he endured for the young lady.</P>
<P>I asked him if the lady knew of his passion, he informed me, that he flattered himself with the return, though they had never spoke to each other, but he had received obliging glan|ces from her fair eyes from the gallery which overlooked the court of guard.</P>
<P>I agreed that if he would write a letter, I'd pawn my life she should have it, and an answer to the bargain, if she had any inclination to send one. He embraced me, and thanked me for my kind proffer, and wrote a passionate letter to the lady, which I accompanied with another, to let her know I was devoted to her service upon the colonel's account.</P>
<P>In two days I had an answer conveyed into a hollow tree in the garden, as I had concerted in my note to her, that wait|ed on the colonel's.</P>
<P>These paper-messengers brought matters to bear, and the kind lady resolved to venture herself with the colonel.</P>
<P>We contrived a ladder of ropes long enough to reach from her window to the terras on the court of guard: and I con|veyed a small bundle of pack-thread for her to throw down, which we fastened to the ladder of ropes, and the lady, with much difficulty, pulled it up, and fastened it to an iron chest which was in the room: But as she came trembling for fear down the ladder, it drew the chest along the floor above, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">kened that old devil her father. He immediately alarmed all the servants, as well as slaves, but the colonel had got safe off with his mistress.</P>
<P>When old hunks had summoned us all together, he went into the room to see what the matter was; but when he sound his money safe, his distraction began to abate. I must own&punc; I wished heartily we could have cleared his money too, as well as his daughter. It was some time ere he missed her, as hav|ing no notion of her elopement; but when he found she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gone, his passion was insurmountable; for the good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> made bold with writings of an estate, that it seems were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her by an old aunt; and I was very well pleased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

go empty-handed to my colonel; for I take money to be the sinews of love as well as of war.</P>
<P>The enraged Don ran up and down like a madman, with about a dozen of us at his heels: and as we appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ned the ditch of the castle, which happened to be free from water, (the tide being out) but pretty well provided with mud, some of the servants imagined they saw something lie on the mud. The old Don being very peery, was stooping down, and gazing to be satisfied; and the devil prompting me just at the same time, I clapt my knee into his bum, and down fell the poor old Don into the mud.</P>
<P>I was the first which cried out for help, yet I did not make extraordinary haste to assist him; but at last ropes were brought, and after he had floundered about a quarter of an hour, we lug|ged him up in a sweet pickle.</P>
<P>By good luck, he did not mistrust the favour was designed him, but purely accidental. I had an opportunity the next day to find out the lady and the happy colonel, who had brought a commission from the priest to go to bed together. He was so well pleased with my service, that he promised to ran|som me from Don Sancho, and did not doubt but he should succeed, seeing the Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> made money his <HI>summum bonum.</HI> But we were surprised at the refusal, for he had such a strict charge from the viceroy of Peru to hold me fast, that it was more his interest to keep me than to part with me. Nay, this proposal opened the old Don's eyes, for he saw plainly I was at the bottom of his daughter's affair. This so enraged him that he ordered a great wooden clog to be locked fast to my leg, which I as obliged to lug along with me.</P>
<P>This proceeding drove me almost to despair, and I lost all hopes of ever procuring my liberty.</P>
<P>The colonel and his lady (who had recovered the fortune from Don Sancho) were very much grieved at my ill usage, and tried all manner of means for my liberty, but to no pur|pose. I passed three years in this uncomfortable life, and had the pleasure to hear that my implacable enemy the viceroy of Peru was summoned to Spain, upon the account of some mal-administration. At the hearing of this news, my hope of freedom began to revive, but it was soon clouded again;
<PB N="197" REF="046409_0195_10215F97B874E180">
for the old devil Don Sancho, was resolved to keep me a martyr to his own revenge; and I weathered out two years more in my wretched confinement: though, thanks to heaven, nothing depressed my spirits quite.</P>
<P>The colonel got an opportunity to tell me that there was a vessel in the road bound for Lima; and the captain being a very good friend of his, he had prevailed with him to take me on board him, if it was possible for me to get out of hunk's clutches.</P>
<P>I made all the efforts imaginable, but to no purpose; and I was once more in my imagination given up to eternal slavery.</P>
<P>The same night, as I was endeavoring to compose my trou|bled thoughts, I heard a great noise in the castle-yard, and was very much surprised a while after, when I saw an officer and a file of soldiers come to seize me as a plotter against the state, and carried me to the colonel's lodging. But my surprise was turned into joy, when I found he had used the stratagem to gain me my freedom. I told him he had trebly repaid the obligation he was pleased to say he lay under to me, and I was resolved not to accept of my liberty till I found what stir Don Sancho made about it: but the colonel resolved me that he had the means in his own hands to pacify him.</P>
<P>I went on board, and set sail the same evening. We had but an indifferent voyage, being involved in many storms; yet at last we arrived safe at Calao.</P>
<P>I shall, if you think fit, give you a short description of Bal|divia, because few foreigners are permitted to enter their port.</P>
<P>Baldivia, or Valdivia, takes its name from the first se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nder, a Spaniard. The old town stood a little higher than the new one, till it was destroyed by the Indians. For Peter Baldivia, and the rest of the Spaniards, were such tyrants over the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r natives, that they took heart, laid an ambush for them, and destroyed them every one. But in the new town they are suf|ficiently guarded from their insults, or danger from a foreign enemy: which have often attempted them to no purpose. This being reckoned the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> country for gold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in all A|merica, nature has b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ded them very much in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the place; for there is so l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ge a sand-ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="198" REF="046409_0196_10215F9945D26EC8">
of the bay, that vessels are obliged to come within five hundred yards of the shore (which is guarded by a strong castle) to avoid it. It is a difficult harbour to enter; but when you are once at anchor, no wind on the whole compass can hurt you, though it blew a storm, it is so well sheltered by the land on all sides of it.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are chiefly made up of banished persons, who generally work in the mines for so many years: and the time expired, they have so much land of their own to cultivate; and most of them find the means to be rich; but how honestly, I'll give you leave to judge. The country about it is very fruit|ful, and produces great numbers of apple-trees, from which they make very good cyder. But the juice of the grape is very unpalatable there, and those that do procure it, must pay ex|travagantly for it.</P>
<P>This city (for 'tis no less) is esteemed the key to the South Sea.</P>
<P>The governor and officers are generally sent from Lima, but the soldiers are composed of those persons that are sent there for a punishment. And though few persons choose to be sent there, yet as few desire to leave it, when once they are settled.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the people could make a shift to live with|out religion, yet there are seven churches and three monaster|ies; but they seemed to be in a ruinated condition: and I don't doubt but an age or two hence, those that pass that way may find them totally ruined.</P>
<P>As I said, we arrived safe at the port of Calao, I was resolved to remain incognito, till I had enquired into the affairs of the city.</P>
<P>I took an occasion to send to my Indian tenant, who came to me, and was very well pleased to find me at liberty.</P>
<P>I sent him to several of my friends, to acquaint them with what circumstances I lay under, who soon informed the vice|roy of my misfortune, and he as readily complied with my de|sire, allowing me the liberty I had enjoyed before I was sent to Baldivia.</P>
<P>I once more made my appearance at Lima, renewed my ac|quaintance, and began to divert myself as before. By degrees
<PB N="199" REF="046409_0197_10215F9B0507D780">
I crept into the good graces of the viceroy, who gave me a post in the government, that brought me a considerable income, and, with the esteem of most people, I pass'd on a whole year.</P>
<P>The viceroy, not liking his situation, found the means to be recalled to Spain: yet, recommending me to his successor, I remained in the same station he before had given me; though I cannot brag of any more favours bestowed on me by my new superior; for he was a man of an uncertain temper, proud and revengeful. He was newly married to a very rich widow at Lima, who had a very beautiful daughter, by report; for she was not suffered to take the liberties of the place.</P>
<P>I often had a great desire to see her face, for I had observed her veiled many times at church, which was all the liberty she had. I was informed she was designed a wife for the supreme judge, though much against her inclination, seeing there was a disparity of years, which is certainly the greatest bitter to the sweets of matrimony; but nothing is consulted now more than wealth.</P>
<P>I received a letter from my uncle at Seville, wherein he de|sired I would leave Lima, and come to Spain: and to induce me to it, he gave me the promise to make me his heir. I must own I began to be pretty well tired of this climate; and the time drawing on for the expiration of my mortgage, I set my|self to prepare things accordingly.</P>
<P>I disposed of my plantation to my faithful Indian for an un|der price, seeing I thought I was under many obligations to him. I resigned up my office in the viceroy's palace, indeed, because I could not get leave to dispose of it.</P>
<P>I turned all my effects into gold dust, and sent it before me to my uncle; and now I only waited for company to go over land to Vera Cruz, a port in the North Sea, where I should have the convenience of embarking for Spain.</P>
<P>I began now to think of settling in the world, and indeed it was almost time, for I had pass'd my twenty-eighth year, and at that age the heat of youth should be pretty well over; for if a man cannot see his follies on this side thirty, he is in dan|ger of being incorrigible all the days of his life. Besides, I had very good encouragement to stability, in my own fortune, and
<PB N="200" REF="046409_0198_10215F9E03DD6910">
the prospect of my uncle's; who, in all probability, had not many years to live, being in his eighty-third year.</P>
<P>Well then, as my story is almost off the stage, I'll throw you into the bargain a short account of one place more, for my catastrophe, and then to my epilogue for detaining you so long, and that shall be the description of Lima, as it is at present.</P>
<P>Lima, the capital city of Peru, is situated about two leagues from the sea-port of Calao, in 12 degrees 6 minutes of southern latitude, and 79 degrees 45 minutes of western longitude. It is built on a noble plain, with hills at a distance.</P>
<P>Francis Pizarro was the founder, in the year 1535, though it has changed its name, since his time, from La Cindad de los R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ges, or City of Kings, to Lima, which is only a corruption of the Indian word Rimac, which was the name of an Indian idol formerly worshipped in that place.</P>
<P>This is the finest city (next to Mexico) in all America. All the streets are in a direct line exactly measured out, and much of the same length and breadth, being fifty yards wide.</P>
<P>In the heart of the city is the noblest square my eyes ever beheld, and in the midst a fountain of brass, adorned with eight lions, continually spouting water, supplied by the river of Li|ma, that runs through the skirts of the town, covered with a handsome stone bridge that leads to the suburbs. Within the suburbs, is a fine public walk, beautified with orange-trees, and in the evening it is crouded with the best company of the city. Although this city is so beautiful, it was mostly destroyed by an earthquake in the year 1682. There are no less than fif|ty-seven churches and chapels (with those that are in the mon|asteries) in this city, and twenty-four monasteries for men, and twelve for women. The cathedral is very magnificent, as are most of the other churches, though chiefly built with wood from the first story, by reason of the earthquakes.</P>
<P>The viceroy of Peru has his residence here, and is so pow|erful that he hardly owns the king his master to be his supe|rior. Here are likewise kept all the courts of justice, and from the high court there is no appeal. Among the rest, they have settled an inquisition, which, on my conscience, is worse than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Spain. Heaven keep every body from it; for in this
<PB N="201" REF="046409_0199_10215FA1088117F0">
court the informant is a witness, and the accuser is ever behind the curtain; and, to mend the matter, the witnesses are never brought face to face.</P>
<P>To compleat the grandeur of the place, there is an archbish|opric, and an university of three well filled colleges; though the students don't always follow learning, for I have found some ignorant enough.</P>
<P>There are twelve hospitals, and one of them for Indians.</P>
<P>This city is garrisoned with two thousand horse, and six thou|sand foot; but very indifferent troops for service against a for|eign foe, being chiefly composed of Creolians and Indians. These Creolians (who are so named from owing their birth to America) are most of them proud, lazy and ignorant, and gen|erally tyrants whenever they have power, though sharp enough as to trade, and will over-reach you if they can.</P>
<P>They are all inclined to venery, and will sacrifice every thing to gratify that vice. The women (who are really very hand|some) generally sit at home all day cross-legged, and as mute as fishes; but at night it is customary to haunt the streets veil|ed, and will as hardly be refused a favour, as the men with us on the like occasion.</P>
<P>As I was sitting one evening in my lodging, dispatching some letters for Spain, I heard somebody knock softly at my door. My servant was gone abroad, and therefore I rose and opened it myself; but was surprised to see a lady veiled, who, without making any words, came in and sat down on a couch. After she had reposed herself some time, she unveiled, and discovered to me one of the sweetest faces I had ever seen. I was almost turned into stone at the sight of so much beauty, and was ready to fall down and worship her as divine. Said she, I came not here to be gazed at; I like you, and if you can do the same by me, I believe you will not use me ill.</P>
<P>Madam, I replied, I know no other way to convince you that I like you, but one. With that I took her into an alcove, where we soon came to a right understanding. As soon as our small matter of business was over, she desired to be dismissed, yet with a promise to give me another visit the next evening; But, said she, if you should chance by any accident to see me in any
<PB N="202" REF="046409_0200_10215FA291CF6ED8">
other place, take your eyes from the object for fear of danger; for those messengers of the soul betray their trust. I promised to observe her directions, and left her, but yet could not help my curiosity; for when she was got down stairs, I put on my cloke, followed her, and observed she went into the viceroy's palace. I was convinced by the dress she wore, that she was none of the common sort; and much diverted I was at the accident.</P>
<P>The next day, she did me the favour of another visit, when we passed our time as pleasantly as we could; and my Incog|nita seemed very much pleased with my company.</P>
<P>After our toying was over, she told me she was afraid of los|ing me, for she heard I designed for Spain. I informed her, nothing had power to stop me, but the passion I had for her.</P>
<P>She at last discovered herself to me: she was daughter-in-law to the viceroy: she told me that she had respected me a great while, and had many disputes with her honor and love; but the former was forced to give way to the latter. She likewise let me know of her approaching marriage, and added, that the knowledge of my person would make her aversion to her husband much stronger. We had many meetings to the content of us both; and she made me several presents of jewels, which I intend to keep for her sake, having preserved them through all my fortunes. Our meetings now began to be less frequent, seeing the weeding-day was fixed, which gave me a great deal of uneasiness. To divert my melancholy, I usually took a walk in the orange-grove, where, in my musing fits, I often staid long|er than usual.</P>
<P>As I was going home one evening, I heard the clashing of swords at a distance, and immediately after, saw a person run|ning towards me, who cried, For the Virgin Mary's sake, if you are a gentleman, lend me your sword, to defend myself against a villain who has offered me the vilest indignity. I made him no answer, but gave him my sword, (for he looked like a man of quality) and followed him.</P>
<P>Just as I turned the corner, I saw him engaged, and his an|tagonist dropt down dead.</P>
<P>The gentleman seeing that, took to his heels.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="046409_0201_10215FA41A191760">
The street being alarmed with the bustle, as I came near the body, I was seized as the murderer. What strengthened their opinion, (and I must confess had but an indifferent look) was my sword remaining in the body of the deceased. All my asseverations of innocence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ignified nothing: I was carried before the Corrigidore; but having no witnesses of my assault|ing him, and one fellow by good fortune proving I was not the person that engaged him first, I was only once more con|demned to Baldivia. I cursed my hard stars a thousand times, and the grief of parting from my mistress was like to rid me of my life; but time began to wear it off.</P>
<P>I was secured in the castle of the city till the vessel was ready to sail.</P>
<P>While I was confined, in order to be transported to Baldiv|ia, a gentleman came into the prison, and begged half an hour's conversation with me. I had been so liberal to the keeper with my money, and pretty jovial in my humour, that I believe if I had asked him to let me go, he would not have denied me; so that I begged the favour to admit the gentleman, and his absence during our conversation. He obeyed me in both, and the gentleman entered my room: which, though mean, was the best in the prison.</P>
<P>As soon as the gentleman had reposed himself upon a chair, (none of the best) he asked me if I would please to refresh my|self with any thing the place afforded; but I answered in the negative; he made a half a dozen hums and haws, and opened his mouth to utter sense.</P>
<P>Sir, said he, you see before you the unhappy person who is the occasion of your confinement. I should not be thus free with you, if I were not assured of your generous good nature. Once more I must tell you, you see before you the unhappy man who is guilty of that fact you are to suffer for. I am a gentleman by birth; and though I had not the good fortune to owe my first birth to Old Spain, yet I have this for my conso|lation, that my parents were born at Cordova there; but the frowns of fortune driving them to this part of the world, gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w ashamed of her ill looks, and greeted them with smiles of fa|vour. In a few years, Plutus the god of wealth made them a visit, and took his leave of them with a promise of his frequent return; and he proved as good as his word, for in a little time
<PB N="204" REF="046409_0202_10215FA67A9E5CE8">
fortune became a neuter gender, that is believing they did not want her assistance, they were no more her devotees.</P>
<P>Sir, said I, the sooner you will please to come to plain Span|ish, the sooner I shall be in the ready road to your business.</P>
<P>Why then, said he, not to keep you in suspense, I am the person that was obliged to you for your sword on such a time, which proved the instrument of my revenge on a base wretch, that deserved an eternity of torments after this life, for wrong|ing the best of women. And since I find you love the shortest way, without the tedious outward flourishes of rhetoric, I will inform you of my story, with as much brevity as I am capable of.</P>
<P>My mother died about seven years since, and I may very justly say, the rest of my father's life was a delirium; but death taking pity of his griefs, came to his aid, and about two years ago I was left master of a plentiful fortune.</P>
<P>As death is the end of all things, and age must pay its tribute to him, I shook off my grief for my father's loss; and in six months after his decease, fell in love with a young lady of in|comparable beauty, at least in my eye. My fortune gave me easy access to the father of my fair, and when I had the hap|piness of conversing with the object of my wishes, she did not seem averse to my passion. Every thing concurring to my de|sires, Hymen joined those hands whose hearts were united before.</P>
<P>For several days we revelled in the sweets of love; and I may justly say, possession had not the power to pall desire; each moment of enjoyment seemed new, and my utmost wish was centered in her breast; but the dire fiend, tormenting jealousy, at last crept in, and palled my appetite to ardent love, the fatal bitter to our mutual sweets.</P>
<P>I had a person that I called my friend, who shared the af|fluence of fortune with me; we had the same desire to love and hate: I therefore thought I was but poorly blest, till my friend saw the idol of my soul. But Oh! what p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngs that fa|tal moment cost me: his eyes received the bane to all his peace, and in one moment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">dered up his heart. I gave him leave (for what could I refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> such a friend?) to visit my wife, when business demanded my absence. He often declared his passion to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by plaintive sighs and languishing looks. When my wife
<PB N="205" REF="046409_0203_10215FA9DFD3C038">
perceived he importuned her too far with his love, she threat|ened to tell me of it; but in the mean time, he had acquainted me with what had passed between him and my wife. Said he, My friend, I imagined your wife was like other women, prone to change; therefore, in your absence, I counterfeited a pas|sion for her, to see whether she had that regard she ought to have for you, and I am pleased to find that you have made so worthy a choice.</P>
<P>I must own to you, I was mightily pleased with this trial of my friend, as believing it sprang from his kindness to me; and I had much to do to reconcile my wife to his visits. She would often say, I wish your friend would be sincere in his professions to you; for my part, I greatly doubt it.</P>
<P>In a little time after this accident, I perceived my friend be|gan to look very melancholy; I endeavoured to sift the secret from him, but to no manner of purpose for some time.</P>
<P>One day as we were riding out to take the air together, he seemed more deeply plunged in sorrow than usual. I told him I should not take him for my friend any longer, if he did not let me into the cause of his disorder. At last, with much re|luctance, he told me that the good opinion he had before con|ceived of my wife was false, for he was well assured she was not true to my bed.</P>
<P>You may imagine what a thunder-clap this must be to me, from a friend who I was assured in myself would not relate a falsehood. It was some moments before I could open my mouth; and all the time of my silence&punc; he seemed so much grieved that he had declared the secret to me, that I had no doubt of the truth of it.</P>
<P>When my grief had given me liberty of speech. I begged he would give me the foundation of his suspicion; but he desired to be excused till he had a certain proof of her infidelity, which he did not doubt but that he should soon have, though it was what he wished to be deceived in; and farther added, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e would not have me take any notice of it, but carry it fair to her, as if nothing had happened; For if you should, said he, you will never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the truth of the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="046409_0204_10215FAC34529B88">
I promised to comply with him, and went home: but Heaven knows with what a heart.</P>
<P>I followed my friend's advice punctually, but yet could not help showing the discontent of my mind in my countenance. My wife was mightily concerned for my melancholy, and was very pressing to know the cause; and in a very tender manner seemed to be disquieted, which I took all for art, and the cun|ning of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ex.</P>
<P>I must own to you, that sometimes I imagined my friend had deceived me; but whenever we had an opportunity of conver|sing, he strengthened my jealousy to such a degree, that I be|gan to wish the cause of it no longer in this world. And if it had not been for my revenging myself on the supposed part|ner&punc; of her guilt, I had certainly taken methods to dispatch her hence.</P>
<P>I had some affairs to transact at Segovia every year; and the time drawing on for my journey, my friend told me, before my return I should have demonstration of her infidelity; For, said he, your absence will give her the opportunity she wants, and she'll be sure to take hold of it.</P>
<P>It was a great while before I could be prevailed upon by my friend to undertake really this journey, but only to feign as if I had, that I might be convinced of her perfidy, and punish it myself; but my friend laid me down so many reasons for it, that I at last very unwi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lingly agreed to go. But in the mean time, said he, you must order that I may have admittance in your absence&punc; that I may take my opportunity to observe all passages. Why, said I, I never knew you debarred the liberty of my house. But you know, said he, since my false declaration of love to try your wife's virtue, she has looked upon m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> more like an enemy than a friend, as knowing I was not sincere in my passion; for women&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e they ever so vicious, yet they ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or the man that doubts their virtue. Well then, said I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> if you will. we'll sup together to-night; and then I'll take an opportunity to leave directions with my faithless wife, to al|low you the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me privileges in my absence as you now have. Why th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, returned my friend, don't you be surprised at what I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> say to her.</P>
<P>We par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> I went to prepare every thing for my intended

journey. When I was at dinner with my wife, I gave her some hints concerning my friend, and that I desired he should have admittance in my absence; I observed she changed colour at my discourse, and seemed to be in the utmost confusion, al|though I did not seem to see it.</P>
<P>After some talk about indifferent matters, she told me, if I thought fit, she intended to live private in my absence, and ad|mit of no visitors. For Sir, said she, the world will be censori|ous, and receiving visits from a man, when you are from home, is not consistent with our Spanish cus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s. She found by my dis|course that I was determined it should be so, wherefore she left off arguing upon that subject: but I could perceive all the time we were together, my resolves sat very uneasy upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: and it was with much difficulty she restrained her tears. Her sor|row struck me to the heart, and it was the greatest struggle I ever went through, to keep my temper: for I imagined all her grief was in having this spy upon her actions.</P>
<P>When night approached&punc; my friend came according to ap|pointment, and during our supper, I told my wife, she was to look upon him as my only friend, and give him the same ad|mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">e as if it was myself, in every thing he should desire&punc; well knowing (I told her) he would ask nothing contrary to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> amity.</P>
<P>Sir, said my friend, I am very sorry I can't comply with your desires; for I have received letters from a near relation at Pa|nama, and I am obliged to attend his nuptials, seeing he can't make proper marriage settlements without I am upon the spot, and I fear I shall hardly return this six weeks. I was at first very much surprised at this his sudden resolution, and was going to say something upon it, till I observed he winked at me. I th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n began to remember what he said to me in the morning, that I should not take notice of what he said: But I observed that the cloud upon my wife's face began to disappear by de|grees, which seemed to me the greatest proof of her infidelity. I was so provoked with the imaginary wrong, that I could not help shewing it in words and actions: but yet I had so much reason in my madness (for passion is no less) that I concealed the real cause.</P>
<P>My wife seemed confounded at my incoherent anger, having never seen my fury before; and when my friend was gone, beg|ged
<PB N="208" REF="046409_0206_10215FB116912D08">
I would tell her the real cause of my uneasiness, for she was well assured some secret cause had ruffled my temper; but I persisted in the obstinacy of not discovering it to her, and the next day pursued my journey, with a dismal idea of what was to come.</P>
<P>Thought had so much impaired my strength with its violent workings, that I found it a difficult thing to sit on my horse; and when I came to my inn at night, I was carried to bed in a violent fever, and all night was in a delirium. My servants sent for a physician, who gave me something to resist my malady; and while he was with me, I uttered some words in my ravines, that gave him to understand my disease proceeded from the mind. When I came to myself, I was something surprised to hear him speak to me after this manner:</P>
<P>Sir, I have so long dealt with diseases of most kinds, that I have knowledge enough to perceive when they proceed from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill habit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> maladies of the mind that slight all physic; and be not amazed when I tell you, I have often cured the latter by wholesome advice. You are a young man, and perhaps you have taken a wrong conception of things; if you will be pleased to tell me your case, I'll give my advice without a fee; and do not think me impertinent to desire it. I have seen more years than you. You may conceal your name in your relation, and if my advice does not please you, you are but just where you were: I shall be as faithful in keeping your secret, as your confessor.</P>
<P>You may be assured I was very much surprised at his pro|ceeding, and I easily perceived a sincerity in his discourse, that gained him my esteem; and I was resolved to let him into my story; which I did, as much as I have to you.</P>
<P>After a pause, he said, I had just come up to his imagination of my case; and now, Sir, said he, I will proceed to my advice. Consider well what you are about; you have confessed your friend owned to you he made pretended love to your wife, to try her virtue, and yet I do not find he advised with you about it before he had put his device in practice. To give you my sentiments of this matter, I believe your friend to be false to you, and that he really is in love with your wife. The dis|tress of your spouse proceeded from her indignation to him, and love to you. His telling you, after his attempt upon her,
<PB N="209" REF="046409_0207_10215FB36787CBF8">
was no more than to be first in the declaration, as imagining she would of course inform you with it: her keeping it a se|cret from you was, not to make you uneasy, and his declaring his suspicion of her virtue afterwards, was either to be revenged on her for slighting his passion, or to give him an opportunity in your absence to wrong your wife.</P>
<P>This, in short, I fancy will prove the whole truth. Neither is this judgment hard to make, for I am apt to believe, any disinterested person would make the same judgment. Your pas|sion has blinded your reason, yet, nevertheless, if you can give yourself time to think calmly, I do not in the least doubt but you'll be of my opinion. This I am assured of, jealousy is a certain sign of love; and if you should, in the heat of passion, do a rash deed, every moment of your life will prove a torment to you. Lover's eyes are often false, and too quick in false constructions. Call reason to your assistance; that will prove your best friend. Take some time to think of my advice and counsel: friends may as soon prove false as wives, and you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> better lose the former than the latter.</P>
<P>All the while he was speaking, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">thought I was listening to an oracle; and, at the end of his discourse, I could not help blaming myself for my rash belief. I called over in my mem|ory every particular of my wife's behaviour, and could not find any one action start up, to give me that hard opinion I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rashly conceived against her.</P>
<P>I returned the physician of my mind, as well as body&punc; many thanks for his cordial advice; and would have paid him in another kind, but I could not prevail upon him to take a single dollar. No, said he, in accepting of your money&punc; I shall make it appear, that, like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I pleaded for my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. No Sir, all the recompense I shall a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you, is, only to let me know the truth of every thing, when the catastrophe is over, which I hope will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your wife: and if I might throw in one word of advice more, if you find the friend you have so much confided in to be false, show your resentment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> slighting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and leave revenge to Heaven. I promised to follow his judicious advice in every thing, and so we parted with a very good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for each other.</P>
<P>I was resolved to proceed no farther or my journey, but make the best of my way back again; and as l went along, consider
<PB N="210" REF="046409_0208_10215FB5C5F31628">
of my behaviour, and let time alone for proof. The reason I gave my servants for returning, was, that I had not strength enough to pursue my journey, which, in reality, was no false|hood, for I was weak enough; and I am convinced that disor|ders of the mind weaken the body more than habitual distem|pers. In part of my journey back, I could not come to any resolution how to behave, and therefore resolved to lie one night more upon the road, to see if my pillow would advise me. When I arrived at my inn, one of my servants told me Don Roderigo was just alighted. Hearing him named, my blood ran a wild course about my body, and immediately it struck to my mind that something was not right.</P>
<P>I asked my servant if Don Roderigo had seen him; he told me no, and that he seemed disguised, as if he did not desire to be known. This strengthened my suspicion of some ill action intended, or done already, and that he was making his escape. I ordered my servants not to appear: but when supper was rea|dy, I sent for my host to bear me company, when, after some trivial discourse, I asked him what guests he had in the house. He made no scruple in telling me; but when he came to Don Roderigo, he declared he did not much like him; for he seemed very willing to be private with two of his servants; and he had observed them often whispering. They design, said he, to be going very early in the morning, but I don't know which road they travel. I concealed my disturbance of mind from my host, but resolved to be gone as early as Don Roderigo: and to be sure of being early enough, I determined not to go to bed, not|withstanding the weakness of my body required repose.</P>
<P>In the middle of the night, I heard people whispering in the next room, and I could easily distinguish Roderigo's voice: though I could gather but little of their discourse, yet I could hear mine and my wife's name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">en mentioned.</P>
<P>At break of day, I found they were preparing to be gone: and though I was pretty expeditious, yet they were got out of the inn before I could get on horse-back with my servants. I was much vexed at it, yet pursued my journey homeward. But I was very much amazed, when, about two leagues from Lima, I met my wife in a coach with her maid, and two Indian ser|vants. The servants, as soon as they saw me, were overjoyed, and my wife could not open her mouth for some time. I then
<PB N="211" REF="046409_0209_10215FB766838AF8">
began to relapse into my former jealousy, and imagined she was following Don Roderigo.</P>
<P>At last she opened her mouth with a great deal of joy, Lord, my dear, said she, is it you in reality, or are my senses deceiv|ed? I asked her the reason of her journey, and her mighty surprise. Sir, answered she, that question confounds me; have I not a letter from you, to come with all speed imaginable? Here it is, continued she. I took the letter from her, and read the contents, which were as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>PURSUING my journey. I had the misfortune to fall from my horse, and break my arm, which prevents my writing to you. The accident is attended with a violent fever, which, I am told, is very dangerous. I have refrained writing to you till now, as expecting some amendment; but finding my|self worse, I beg you will come to me with all the expedition imaginable, for fear you should never see me more alive.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>There needed no sphynx to unriddle this enigma; and I ob|served, by my wife's countenance, we both knew the author of the letter. While we were confused, the coachman that drove the coach was stealing away; but my wife cried out to stop him, for that was the messenger that brought the letter to her: and she farther added, he told her that he was to conduct her to me, for the coachman we had before, was drowned: She said that that circumstance deceived her more than any thing else: The fellow also told her that I had prevailed with a gentleman in the neighbourhood, where I lay hurt, to send him to drive the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h. I rode after the fellow, and brought him back, or|dered him into the coach-box, and forced him to drive out of the road, to a neighbouring village, where lived a gentleman of my acquaintance. He very unwillingly complied with my com|mands; and we kept very close to him to prevent his making away. When we arrived at my friend's house, we secured the fellow in a strong room, and I left two of my Indian servants to guard him. I made my friend acquainted with the accident, and that this visit was not intended, but by mere chance. He
<PB N="212" REF="046409_0210_10215FB9E4EEE138">
gave me to know I was welcome, let what would bring me there.</P>
<P>When my wife, and I, with my friend were alone, I tenderly embraced her, and begged her pardon for my unjust suspicions of her virtue, and related the whole progress of my jealousy, without omitting the least circumstance. She gave thanks to Heaven for the danger she was saved from, and related to me the manner of her being deceived by the fellow that brought the letter, as follows:</P>
<P>The fifth day after you had left me, as I was musing in the garden, my maid told me a person had a letter to deliver me from you. I began to tremble with timorous apprehensions, and my whole frame felt violent disorders. I ordered the bearer to be brought to me; and when I had read the letter, grief locked up my tongue, and I had not power to speak for some time. When I had recovered speech, I asked the fellow where you were. Madam, said he, he is at Don Floria's country-house, (naming a friend of mine, that my wife had heard me often mention) and knowing you had never a coachman, my master sent me to conduct you to your husband. I would not spend time in dressing myself, but just as I was, with my maid and the two Indians, pursued our journey. I never once dreamed of any treachery, though I always doubted your false friend; but as he had never been to visit me in your absence, it wiped away all suspicions of him. I observed that the coachman, by his looks, did not like the company of my servants, but I was too much concerned for you think of it much.</P>
<P>We congratulated one another again at our happy deliver|ance, and admired the workings of divine providence, and the second cause, my friendly physician.</P>
<P>My wife expressed a great desire to see him, to return him acknowledgments for his inspired advice, and, in the morning I promised her to go to him, if we could get any convenient carriage; for we were not very fond of making use of the coachman that brought her out.</P>
<P>I deferred his examination <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill the next day, being too much fatigued to do it then, though I had ordered he should want nothing but his liberty; for I considered him only as an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to work his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">. When I was up in the morning, I ordered him to be brought before me; but, after
<PB N="213" REF="046409_0211_10215FBCFB8DC9E0">
some time, they brought me word he had made his escape, by creeping through the cieling of the room, and throwing down the shingles, for it was a single apartment near the garden. I was a little uneasy at his getting away as well as my wife, for fear his master should make some attempt upon us in the house where we were, it being a quarter of a mile from the village, and the gentleman my friend had but few servants; therefore, it was thought the safest course for us to go immediately to Lima. And as soon as we could procure mules we set out, and reached that city without any molestation.</P>
<P>I heard nothing of the faithless Roderigo for several days, neither did I think it strange; for I imagined, if he had any shame left, he would not dare to appear publickly at Lima; but if he did, I had resolved to take my friendly physician's advice, (which proved so successful to me in my distress) to show my resentment in slighting him.</P>
<P>One night, as soft repose had locked up our senses, we were alarmed from our downy sleep, by a fearful cry of Fire! fire! I arose, and ran into my wife's apartment, where she remained frighted almost to death: and as people generally, on the alarm of fire, know not what they do, she ran to the chamber where the maids lay, and dressed herself in her servant's cloaths. The maid being equally frighted, when she found she had no cloaths to put on, clapped on her mistress's which I had brought af|ter her, and was running down stairs to free herself from the danger. As she was going through the hall, I observed four men in masks seized her, and carried her off. I followed her with my sword in my hand, till one of the villainous company came behind me, and run me through the back. My servants, who came after me, bore me in faint with loss of blood, but by good fortune, the wound did not prove dangerous, though well meant.</P>
<P>We could never come by the truth how the house was set on fire, though it was soon extinguished: but we were assured it must be by some one of the domestics. It was easy to judge Don Roderigo was the cause of it, by running away with the maid, as mistaking her for my wife, because she had in the hurry put on her mistress's cloaths and veil.</P>
<P>I was advised by my best friend to summon him before the supreme judge, for it was dangerous to let him go on with im|punity.
<PB N="214" REF="046409_0212_10215FBF83328310">
But he would not obey the summons, therefore he was designed to be out-lawed by due course of law. But as that takes up several months, I was obliged to keep a guard in my house, for I received several menacing letters frequently from him, either thrown over the wall, or left so that we could never secure any person that brought them. While our suit was go|ing on, our new viceroy arrived, who proving a friend to Don Roderigo, a <HI>Noli prosequi</HI> was issued out, and I was obliged to stand at the whole charge of the law-suit. This violent and un|just proceeding of the viceroy's, raised my ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l to that degree, that I sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> many warm things against his administration, which came to his knowledge; for there are generally poor spirited wretches in all governments, that have no other merit than to improve tales, and feed the ears of their superiors with nauseous flattery and lies.</P>
<P>I was sent for to the viceroy, and examined concerning these reports; and so far incensed him with my replies to his ques|tions, that if I had not met with some friends that palliated the matter, I don't know how far his resentment would have carried him. I was dismissed with my liberty, but with a multitude of menaces, if, for the future, I should give my tongue another loose; and I soon found the effects of his rese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tment, by losing a small place in the government; but as providence had put me above wanting it, I was not much grieved at the loss.</P>
<P>My wife begged me to remove from Lima, a place where I had received so many insults; and it was not improbable but I might receive more, which proved but too true.</P>
<P>In a few days after I had appeared before the viceroy, the maid that was forced away (by being mistook for my wife) came home miserably ill used, and brought me a letter from the un|grateful Don Roderigo, which you may read if you please: [Upon that he took the letter out of his pocket, and I found it as follows:]</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The insolence of this letter was not to be borne, and I was as impatient to meet him, as he could be to meet with me; and I must own to you, I thirsted for his blood, for his usage was beyond the nature of man to bear. I examined the poor girl of what she knew of the wretch, who informed me that they put her into a coach, and carried her a league out of town; but when they found their mistake, the usage she bore from them was insupportable, and the brute Roderigo told his servants, if they were pleased to make use of her in the vilest manner, they were welcome. The wretches that served such a villain, must have very near the same sentiments of honour and honestly, or they would seek another master; they were too forward to neglect such a cruelty, and four of them by turns ravished her. Strangers to the nature of the wretches, who are superiors in this part of the world, would imagine such deeds should find punishment by law: But alas! justice has fled the place, and we may expect more mercy from the worst of cannibals than is to be found here.</P>
<P>The poor creature in a little time felt the farther effects of their cruelty; for they gave her a distemper that ended her life.</P>
<P>Before her death she gave me knowledge of the place where they led her; for they had not any caution in their villainous proceeding, but as soon as they had gratified their lust and cru|elty, turned her out of doors.</P>
<P>I had no farther need of any thing to wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t my revenge; but I must own the death of this unfortunate poor creature added fuel to the fire. My wife was almost distracted at the unhappy accident, and had no other consolation, but that she had esca|ped their cruel hands.</P>

I did not acquaint her with my intention of seeking this vil|lain, but I made it my only business; I went to the place the poor maid had directed me to, where I had information that he had left the place, and now resided in Lima. I was very sorry he had changed his habitation, because I should find it a more difficult thing to execute my resentment with safety in Lima. But, however, I sent him the following letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>THY usage to me is not to be borne; therefore if thou hast that spirit, (which I much question, from thy villany, for villains are always cowards) meet me in St. Justin's field to-morrow at six in the morning; as I imagine there is no second in thy villany, I shall expect thee alone; and I hope thou wilt not fail to meet the injured.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>I chose St. Justin's field, for the conveniency of a small pub|lic house which over-looked it, where I went before day, that I might discover if he came alone; for I had but little reason to expect fair play from such a villain. When the time came, I saw him go by the house alone&punc; I let him pass by me, to see if he was not followed by any of his cursed crew; but finding none, I hasted after him, into the middle of the field, and called to him; he turned about, and, with the image of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell in his face, cried, I thought your resentment would have brought you first into the field; but as I am here before you, it speaks me no coward, though your vile scrawl would intimate as much. Come, said I, no words, thy breath is poison to me, it will in|fect the air; Only this, Sir, said he, as you had not named any particular weapons, I have made bold to bring a pair of pistols with me; and to let you see I have some honour, you shall take your choice. I g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ve him no answer, but took one, and we agreed to stand at su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> a distance. As I was going to fire, he cried out, Hold! I will tell you one secret more before we engage, and that is this, your pistol is only charged with pow|der, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ine with ball, which I put in since you made the choice; and now prepare for death, be assured this is the last moment of thy life. I did not give myself time to answer, but fired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pistol and then hurled it at him&punc; and had the good for|tune to cut him in the face with it; and in the confusion and surprise, his pistol went off without hurting me. Now, said
<PB N="217" REF="046409_0215_10215FC823718068">
I, thou wretch! we are once more on equal terms, and Heav|en, I hope, will favour the justest cause. We drew, and in a few passes I laid him for dead on the ground; though in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">encounter I had received a dangerous wound in the breast. I went home, notwithstanding my hurt, and sent secretly for a surgeon of my acquaintance, who dressed me, and told me I was in no danger.</P>
<P>My wife was very much grieved at the accident, though she could not but be pleased at Roderigo's death, yet her fears in|creased, as imagining I should suffer for it by the violent tem|per of the viceroy: but her grief began to blow over, when, in several days after, no enquiry was made, nor even any notice taken of his death.</P>
<P>I was very much surprised at it, imagining I had really killed him.</P>
<P>As soon as my wound was well, I went to the little house to enquire if they knew any thing of the body: (for the owner of the house was formerly my servant, and a man of much prob|ity, who knew all my story;) he informed me, that a little while after I past by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> house home again, five persons r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> that way, and coming to the body, seemed to mourn over it, and went the road that leads to St. Dominic; (a village about half a mile from the place where we fought.)</P>
<P>I imagined they had buried him privately in that village, and went home to acquaint my wife, who shared my contentment.</P>
<P>I now went abroad as I was wont, and all the discourse was of Don Roderigo's sudden disappearing. Servants and all had left his house, but no one suspected any thing of his death. Some of my acquaintance told me they imagined this to be some trick of his, and that he only lay dormant to meditate some mischief to me.</P>
<P>I seemed to come into their fears, but in my mind slighted their advice, as imagining I had nothing to fear. I past on a whole month without any danger at all; but as I was going one day across the bridge to a ware-house I had in the sub|urbs, a fellow came up to me, and privately asked me if I would be a chapman for some East-India goods. He told me a long
<PB N="218" REF="046409_0216_10215FC9AD7920E8">
story, that he was obliged to make up a cargo and leave this part of the world, for his credit began to fail, and if he did not get away speedily, his creditors would lay him up. We went to a neighbouring tavern, where he read me his bill of par|cels. He told me he had been encouraged to offer his goods to me, from the fairness of my character; and was coming to wait on me when he had the good fortune to meet me. The next day was agreed on for me to go and view the goods, for I was not to pay for them till they were brought to my ware|house. Accordingly, as appointed, I went to the house of the person, in Benedictine-street. I was shown into a room till the goods were brought; but as I was looking on some paint|ings, five men rushed out of a closet in the room, and seized me. They disarmed me, and took out every thing that was in my pockets, went out, and locked me in. You may imagine the surprise I was in, which was very much increased when I saw my enemy Don Roderigo enter the room. I in my confusion thought I had seen a ghost, for he looked very pale; but he soon convinced me of the contrary. And have I got you at last? said he, I will now revenge myself at leisure; but to com|plete my revenge, I have sent a token for your wife, that I may ravish her before thy face; and then I'll devise tortures to rack every joint about thee. He gave me to know that he had sent my watch for a token, and that she would bring such a sum of money to pay for the goods. The torment of my soul no tongue can express; and I am assured, if they had not ta|ken my sword from me, I had put an end to my wretched life.</P>
<P>The inhuman villain insulted me so much, that I rushed upon him, unarmed as I was, and had certainly choaked him, if his wicked assistants had not dragged me from him.</P>
<P>It is well, said he, I have no other passion but lust reigning in my breast at this instant; but when I have satiated my de|sires on thy wife, I'll then add another pang for this usage; but, in the mean time, I'll leave you to think of this matter alone, for I fancy you don't much care for my company.</P>
<P>As soon as he had made an end of this speech, he and his gang went out, and fastened the door, on the other side. I'll give you leave to imagine the confusion of my thoughts. I remained some time without moving; but accidentally casting my eyes on the door, I observed there was a bar to shut it
<PB N="219" REF="046409_0217_10215FCB53F7ADD8">
on the inside. I immediately barred it, and began to look about to see if I could find any thing for my defence; but to my grief could perceive nothing. I entered the closet, and searched there, but to no purpose. Looking upon the floor of the clo|set, I perceived one of the boards seemed to be loose: I essayed to pull it up, but wanted some engine to effect it. I at last thought of the bar of the door, ran to it, and by main force wrenched it from the staple: for I thought if it would not serve me to make my escape, it would serve me to defend myself: but I easily forced up the board, and with my bar beat down the cieling under me. I was resolved to explore the hidden place, what ever was the consequence; for it could not be worse than to remain where I was. I therefore ventured down, though something of a difficult descent; for the joists were so close together, I had much ado to force my body through; but at last, with much difficulty, I pressed through, and had a desperate fall to the ground.</P>
<P>I soon found I had got into a cooper's cellar, for there were several pipe staves, and tools to work with. I seized upon some of them, and by force wrenched open the cellar door, which led me once more into the street before Don Roderigo's house. I did not give myself time to consider, but ran towards the bridge to get to my own house; but just as I entered the Cordeliers street, I met my wife with her maid, and the wretch that had decoyed me to the house. I ran upon him, seized him by the throat, and flung him over the bridge, where he met with the reward of his villany. I had not power of speech to inform my wife of the accident, but made signs for her to go home. By this time it was dark; and the profligate villain Don Roderigo, fancying his cursed emissary staid too long, came out of his door which faced the bridge. As soon as I discovered him, I ran towards him, and seized him; Now villain, said I, I will not part with thee till thou hast rendered up thy soul to hell. We both struggled, and I kept him down; but the rest of his company coming up to his assistance, I quitted him; and running to see if I could meet with some one armed, I had the good fortune to light on you. As soon as I received your sword, I ran back, and just met the villain as he was entering his door. I ran the weapon into his very heart; and I believe you was a better witness of his death than myself, seeing you were found near the body.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="046409_0218_10215FCEE52A6780">
As soon as I saw him fall, I made the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of my way home, not imagining you would meet with any farther damage than the loss of your sword.</P>
<P>The darkness of the night, I fancy, concealed me from the servants that came to the assistance of their master, for I never once was suspected; or perhaps if they did know me, fear kept them from discovering me.</P>
<P>When I heard of your trial&punc; I came myself into court, and if you had been condemned, resolved to have discovered the truth; but finding you were to be banished to Baldivia, I concealed the fact, imagining I had it in my power to gain your freedom, by paying your ransom; which was the reason I came now to wait upon you, to offer you my service in that or any thing else that lies in my power. I returned him thanks for his offer; and considering his story, I told him I was glad I was in some sort an instrument of his revenge. He would force upon me a ring, and two hundred pieces of gold, and begged he might be ranked in the number of my friends. He made me many visits, and once brought his wife with him. She was a very handsome wo|man, and seemed to have a great deal of wit. She made me several very handsome compliments in behalf of her husband, and begged I would accept of their pictures set round with fine oriental pearls.</P>
<P>He accompanied me on board, when our vessel was to set sail, putting in the captain's hands, fresh provision, and several <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orts of good liquor, to comfort me in my voyage.</P>
<P>I had the happiness to have pirates for my fellow-sufferers, and the viceroy had given out, to take off all censure from him&punc; that I encouraged them in their piracy.</P>
<P>We took our leaves, with protestations of a lasting friendship; and I lived as merrily as I could till the day we had the good fortune to meet with you, which has not given me any reason to change my humour.</P>
<P>We were mightily diverted with the relation of Don Pedro, and I found I was not deceived when I took him for a man that understood the world.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="046409_0219_10215FD1F4106E20">
We had now gained the Streights of Gibraltar; and had en|tered the Mediterranean Sea. But I must confess I could not see the African shore, without numbers of sighs for misfortunes past; and I found my griefs renewed with the remembrance; and all the mitigation I had was the affectionate concern from Don Ferdinand, to whom I had told my whole story. We had not made a day's sail in the Mediterranean, ere we perceived two sail making towards us. I must own, I had no desire to engage, being so richly laden; and therefore, by the advice of both ships' company, made all the sail I could to avoid them. But our vessels being foul with so long a voyage, and never once cleaned during our whole course, they gained upon us, do what we could. When we found there was no getting from them without fighting, we were as much determined on the other hand to sight our ships to the bottom of the sea rather than sur|render. Having fixed this resolution, we prepared for the en|gagement; and when we had got all things in readiness, we lessened our sails that they might come up to us. I ordered every sailor to load as many arms as they could, and not to fire a gun till I gave them orders; but as soon as ever they had fired the great guns, to discharge our small arms upon them. I could not prevail upon Don Ferdinand to keep below, though I saw fear strongly painted in his face. When they came within pistol-shot of our ship, they hailed us and commanded us to strike immediately. We made no other answer than with our guns and small arms, which surprised them, and did them a great deal of damage in their rigging; for cutting the topsail halliards with our shot, the topsail fell down upon the cap, and hindered their ship's way very much; and I believe we might have made our escape. But I perceived the Villars was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ard put to it, (our Spanish man of war, whom I had named the Villars, in remembrance of that dear one.) By this time we were prepared again, and I ordered every man, as soon as they had discharged, to lie flat upon their bellies till we had received the fire of the enemy; which accordingly we did. They fired in upon us, but killed us not one man. Then our hands rose up together, and fired in our small shot.</P>
<P>We had so damaged their rigging with this broadside, that we fell a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> till we were ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ged again, and then I gave our men orders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fire into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the ship, and point their guns low on purpose; which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> found had the desired effect; for they had several shots betw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> wind and water, so that they
<PB N="222" REF="046409_0220_10215FD380D3A3B0">
were obliged to heel the ship on the starboard side, to prevent the water running in on the larboard. Seeing-there was not much to be feared from her, I bore down to assist the Villars, because she was over-matched. But when her antagonist found my design, and understood the condition of the other ship, she made all the sail she could, and fled for it. We did not think fit to follow her, but sent a boat on board to enquire how it stood with them in the Villars. They sent me word they had lost eight men, had three wounded, and were very much mauled in their rigging, as well as their hull, and had received a shot between wind and water, and the ship leaked very much. I bad them search for the leak; but there was no coming at it: there|fore I ordered them to get out as many of the goods as they could, and bring them on board me; the weather proving very favourable, they went to work as fast as they could.</P>
<P>Our men brought me word that the ship we had engaged was sinking. They fired several guns for assistance, and their con|sort being almost out of sight, I bore down to help them all I could; but before we could come to them she sunk to the bot|tom. The men had put out their long-boat and barge, and were got in them, and made towards us. As soon as they came within hearing, they called out for quarter, which I promised them they should have. There were 123 of them; and as their number exceeded ours, we were obliged to confine them, for fear they should take it in their heads to set upon us.</P>
<P>The captain was killed in the engagement, but the lieutenant informed me they were two men of war, of forty guns each, set out from Barcelona to cruise upon the coast; and manned each with two hundred men, but the rest of their crew were either killed, or being wounded sunk with the ship. I did not think it proper to carry them to Italy, for fear it should prove prejudicial to Don Antonio: and understanding, that in remov|ing the goods on board the Villars, they found out the leak and stopped it: I intended to put them on board her, and give them the ship with their liberty; but first I ordered out the guns and ammunition, and her goods, leaving them nothing but provisions and water, which they returned me many thanks for, and so we parted.</P>
<P>The next day there arose such a storm as we had never felt before, and continued in the utmost violence for fourteen days,

so that now we were in danger of drowning, and I believe most would have parted with their wealth to have been safe on shore. At last we discovered land, but were very much surprised to find it Candia, for now we began to be in fear of the Turkish pirates. So we resolved to steer for Zant as fast we could, and there make dividend of our prize money and goods. And accordingly we arrived there safely the third of September 1698.</P>
<P>The island of Zant belongs to the Venetians, therefore we were out of danger from the Turks. The town, which bears the same name with the island, is above a mile in length, seated upon a beach of the bay. It is built mostly of stone, and has a noble look from the sea. To the west of the town stands the castle, built on a high and very steep hill, where most of the merchants dwell, and is very near as big as the city be|low. It is a bishop's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee, and the governor is of the nobility of Venice. The chief commodities they deal in are wine, oil, and currants, which are esteemed of the best growth. They grow on vines like other grapes, and are gathered in July, and then packed in hogsheads, ready for the merchants.</P>
<P>Our men being well pleased they were out of danger, and in a place where wine was to be bought cheap, trafficed so much for that commodity, that most of them fell into dangerous disea|ses; therefore I resolved to leave Zant, and make for Sapienza, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n island with a good harbour, not inhabited, where they would not be under the like temptation, so we came to an anchor there September 8. I ordered twelve guns on shore, and raised a platform capable of defending us from the insults of an enemy. In a pleasant green we put up a large tent, and others smaller by it, for the officers and sailors; but I having but one bed put up on shore, Don Ferdinand was forced to lie with me, though, as I thought, very unwillingly. Our sharing the ready money took us up four days; I reserved a fourth part to my owners, which amounted to upwards of sixty thousand pounds; and a twelfth part for myself, which, with what presents and other things that I had, amounted to the value of 50,000 pounds. Every sailor from first to last shared above twelve hundred pounds a piece; but when we came to divide the goods, we knew not which way to go about it; so with one common consent of the sailors, I was obliged to accept of them, without paying one penny for them.</P>
<P>We set sail for Ostia the next day, after we had finished our
<PB N="224" REF="046409_0222_10215FD786C70FC8">
dividend, and arrived there November 1, after a voyage of two years and seven months, and the richest prize that ever came into any port of Italy. I sent a letter to Don Antonio, to give him notice of my arrival, and advice to come and take care of his cargo. In two days, he, Donna Isabella, and her little son, came on board in a pleasure-boat. I found they were in mourning, and I told them I was afraid to ask them who it was; for they informed me that Isabella's father had been dead above two years, but they had resolved never to wear any other colour till they had seen me. Never was a more tender meeting between friends than between us; and I must confess, for some time all my cares lay hushed.</P>
<P>When I came to inform Don Antonio of the wealth I had brought home, he stood amazed: for besides the money which I told him of, the goods I had on board exceeded in value the freight I went out with. I could hardly prevail upon him to accept of such a sum of money, till I informed him it was but barely his due, and that I had very near as much to my own share.</P>
<P>I presented Don Ferdinand to Antonio and his lady, who seemed very much pleased with him; and Don Pedro, out of his free merry humour, told me, he hoped I would not forget him, because he was older, for he thought he had more right to my friendship than Don Ferdinand, seeing he was an older acquaintance. I let them into his life and humour; they re|ceived him very friendly, and we all went to Don Antonio's villa together.</P>
<P>After staying a week, I began to be tired with so much plea|sure, and therefore begged leave of Don Antonio to visit Rome, only to shew Don Ferdinand that celebrated place. Don Anto|nio sent before to his palace to prepare for our reception, and the next-day we followed. We visited all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, ancient and modern, where we might see the grandeur of the ancient Romans by those stupendous ruins still left. As Rome was formerly a nursery of war and greatness, it is now a nursery of arts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> chiefly painting, architecture, and musick. There have flourished in one century, La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">o, Doa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hino, Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tro du Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tona, the Possines, Camassei.

<PB N="225" REF="046409_0223_10215FDAE67F8B88">
Then Palladio, Vitruvius, Scammozi, Pozza, and many more famous for architecture. Then the divine Corelli for music, whose sweet compositions will be always new; and we may say by him, as a great English poet said of our countryman Shake|speare, that the former had pulled up the roots of music, as the latter of poety, and transplanted them into their own gardens, where all those that follow must borrow a branch from them.</P>
<P>I shall not say any thing more of Rome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">or of Naples, where we went once more upon Don Ferdinand's account. I would have persuaded him to have begun his studies at Rome, (for I supposed him a Roman Catholic) but he would not hear of it, and begged he might go with me into England, which I prom|ised him he should.</P>
<P>Donna Isabella had an orphan cousin that lived with her, of a vast fortune, beautiful to a miracle; who, having seen Don Ferdinand, fell desperately in love with him, but he did not seem to have the least regard for her. Don Antonio discovered to me the secret, and pitying by experience, his kinswoman, de|sired I would forward the match. But when Don Ferdinand understood my desires, he fell upon his knees and begged I would never mention it more; for he had made a solemn resolution never to marry any woman breathing. I pressed him all I could, and laid the folly of such a rash resolution before him; but it was preaching to a tempest, and all my arguments had no power upon him. On the other hand, the merry Don Pedro was as deep in love with Dom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Felicia, which was the name of the orphan lady. But his manner of courtship was so odd, and out of the way, that he caused more diversion than we could have imagined. If she went to bed, he would lay himself down at her chamber-door, and sing songs all night; so that if she had any inclination to have rested, he was resolved she should not; and he would often say, he intended to plague her into a compliance. If she went into the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">en, he was sure to follow her close; or even at church, he would often tell her, it was in vain to pray for a blessing from heaven, when she was committing mur|der with every look. In short, he would often force a smile from the afflicted lady herself.</P>
<P>I was still endeavouring with Don Ferdinand to forget his ras<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|vow: but he desired me, in such moving terms, not to intreat him further, that I resolved never to trouble him any more upon
<PB N="226" REF="046409_0224_10215FDD3844E458">
that theme. Notwithstanding which, I begged of Donna Isa|bella to try what she could do with him, for I imagined com|plaisance might work upon him more than friendship. She sent for him into her closet, and they remained together several hours; and I was very much pleased the next day to see him walking in the garden, with only Donna Felicia. I did not think proper to interrupt them, but when I had an opportunity, I declared my satisfaction. and told him I easily forgave his not comply|ing with me, and yielding to the persuasion of Donna Isabella. He seemed to be in some confusion as what I said to him, which I attributed to his denying me, and his condescension to Donna Isabella. But in a few days&punc; after that, I was something more surprised to see Don Pedro eagerly addressing Donna Felicia, and she regarding him more favourably than usual. And my surprise was increased, when Donna Isabella told me the nup|tial day was fixed between Don Pedro and Donna Felicia. I told her I was very well pleased the lady had so soon forgot h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> violent passion: but I added, that the stronger the flame, the shorter the duration. If so, returned Donna Isabella, we may hope your passion is buried long since. I told her, I did not love like others, for I was resolved to carry mine with me to the grave. By what I have formerly heard from you, returned Donna Isabella, as well as my husband, you have not the least glimpse of hopes. Madam, said I, that is the reason I must despair: for no other fire shall ever warm my breast, but what was kindled there by my first flame. We had much discourse upon the same subject, and Donna Isabella told me at last, I was a pattern for all faithful lovers.</P>
<P>When we were at Naples, I had provided goods and conve|niency of sending to St. Salvador, according to my promise given to Don Jaques: and the vessel being to touch at Ostia, was to send to me for my letters to Don Jaques. I desired Don Fer|dinand to write to his father, but he begged to be excused, for fear it should fall into the hands of his lady; and for the same reason he begged I would be cautious how I mentioned him. I told him he should see what I had wrote, before I sent it; which was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>

<PB N="227" REF="046409_0225_10215FDFA8BB4EA0">
the manner of doing it stamps a double value on the obligation. If there is no way to repay the mighty debt, yet I shall with the utmost gratitude remember Don Jaques, and his kind ben|efits.

Whatever letters you are pleased to honour me with, direct for me at the palace of Antonio de Al|vares in Rome, who will take care to send them to me where|ever I am; for as yet, I am undetermined where to settle my|self, but I have England in view.</HI></P>
</POSTSCRIPT></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I wrote this letter in the Portuguese language, and shewed it to Don Ferdinand, who approved of what I had written.</P>
<P>I had disposed of the rest of my goods on board, and the mon|ey amounted to upwards of fifteen thousand pounds; but I could not prevail upon Don Antonio to accept of one penny.</P>
<P>No, my dear friend, said he, you have already brought me to the fortune of a nobleman; though it is not worldly wealth I covet. I have all the earth contains, in the possession of my adorable wife: and even that, my greatest happiness, is owing to you; and all the allay of joy I have, is, that I cannot see you as blest as I am. But, continued he, time, that wears out all things, will, I hope, cure this amorous sickness of your soul. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et him know my grief was fixed as destiny, and I had nothing else to do but to wing to the place where the joy of my life did once reside; with this only hope, that the lively imagination of my loss would put an end to all my sorrows, by sinking me into the arms of death.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="046409_0226_10215FE2C50873C0">
He was so very much concerned for me, that he could not avoid shedding tears; and used all the arguments he could to persuade me to reside in Italy. I told him I had more reason to go for my native country than what I had given him, and that was the education of young Don Ferdinand, who begged to cul|tivate his studies in England.</P>
<P>I turned all my money into bills of exchange, well knowing the casualities that attend travellers: and I intended to go by land to Flanders with Don Ferdinand, my two faithful Indians, and one servant more.</P>
<P>All my Spanish sailors that I had picked up by the way, had, by my consent, their discharge, and were gone to their several homes, in circumstances beyond their expectations&punc; though they all declared, if I intended another voyage, they would never for|sake me. Some of my English s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lors had married Italian wo|men, and so designed to settle in Italy.</P>
<P>When I desired Don Antonio to take charge of the ship, he told me he had nothing to do with it, declaring it was mine, and therefore desired I would make no more words about it; for, said he, you don't know, but you may meet with some|thing more to change your mind, and we may have the sat|isfaction of seeing you once more.</P>
<P>In a few days after this, the nuptials were celebrated be|tween Don Pedro and Donna Felicia, who designed for Spain, (as soon as I left Italy) where he intended to take up the mortgage of his estate, the time being almost expired. I must own, the uncertainty of womens' tempers gave me much re|flection: and I thought this marriage was a very odd thing.</P>
<P>I now began to think of my journey: but first I ordered a gold-smith to make me every way the same parcel of plate as I received as a present from Don Jaques de Ramirez, which I presented to Donna Isabella, that she might remem|ber me. She gave me many thanks for it, but seemed very unwilling to accept of it a great while. I told her, as mer|rily as I could, if she made any more words about it, I would return the ship that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore her name, and would be no longer under her command. Well, said she, I'll accept it; but as you allow me to be your owner, I'll give you orders in wri|ting,
<PB N="229" REF="046409_0227_10215FE5162FDEE0">
that you must not break it open till you come in such a latitude, that is, a fortnight after you are settled in Eng|land. I promised to obey he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> punctually. The next day she gave me a sealed paper, which, she told me, were the orders she mentioned.</P>
<P>I had given my lieutenant charge of the ship, with direc|tions to make for Bristol, with all the expedition practicable.</P>
<P>The next day, being February 6, 1699, I took my leave of all my acquaintance; and, notwithstanding I am not used to weep, could not forbear shedding some tears at parting with such true friends as Don Antonio and his lady had proved. I rode the first day overwhelmed with melancholy, and not one thought of being possessed with such a fortune, from noth|ing in so short a time, ever entered my breast. But see|ing Don Ferdinand by his countenance, partake of my sor|row, I was forced to appear much less melancholy, to oblige him to be so too.</P>
<P>I would have shewn him the rarities of Italy in our trav|els, but he seemed very little inclined to curiosity; and we arrived at Antwerp without any adventure. We staid some time there to recover the fatigue of our journey, but more upon Don Ferdinand's account, seeing he was something in|disposed, having never travelled on horseback so far before.</P>
<P>As we approached the town, he and my Indians were sur|prised to see the manner of begging. The boys and girls would run before you, and of a sudden stop short, stand up|on their heads, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their hands, saying their prayers all the while.</P>
<P>The city of Antwerp is finely situated upon the River Scheld; it is very well fortified, and upon the walls are planted trees that give an agreeable shade, and make it pleasant walking. The castle, both strong and beautiful, was founded by the Duke of Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a. The city in bigness may compare with Bris|tol; their streets spacious, and houses very magnificent. The church of Sancta Maria, their cathedral, is superb build|ing; and of that neatness, that the emperor Charles the Vth of Germany, would often say, "It was only fit to be kept in a case." The inside is as glorious and neat as the out|side. The paintings were performed by Sir Peter Paul Reu|bens,
<PB N="230" REF="046409_0228_10215FE790C24498">
an inhabitant of Antwerp, and are equal to any thing that ever he did. The Jesuits' church is also very beauti|ful, adorned with abundance of curious marble pillars, and all the pannels painted by the same hand as the other. There are several more beautiful churches and chapels; but, as these mentioned are the chief, we shall take no farther no|tice of them.</P>
<P>The third of April (having pretty well recovered our fa|tigue by a rest of ten days) we set out for Calais, being the shortest cut for Dover, and arrived there April the 6th, making short stages.</P>
<P>From this place we might behold the white cliffs of Do|ver. I must own I had some secret satisfaction in viewing my native country; and the next day, early in the morn|ing we embarked, and reached the town by noon, having a very favourable passage. Here landing, I had like to have lost one of my Indians. Slinging his horses into the boat, he would get upon the back of one of them, thinking he would go out quietly. But just upon the instant, a vessel riding by the pier, fired a gun, and frighted the horse to such a degree, that he plunged into the sea, and swam from the shore; and the Indian, being thrown off with the start, had his foot so entangled in the stirrup, that (notwithstand|ing his skill in swimming) he must have inevitably perished, if the other Indian seeing the misfortune, had not plunged in, and with a knife cut the string. He then took the horse by the bridle with one hand, and swimming with the oth|er, brought him safe to shore.</P>
<P>Don Ferdinand not being over pleased with riding on horse|back, we took the flying-coach the next day, and safely ar|rived at London. I ordered my English servant, and the two Indians, with our baggage, to make two days of it; and gave them directions to wait at the place where the coach inned, till I sent for them.</P>
<P>When we arrived at London, I did not care to go to any of my acquaintance, but rather chose to lie at a bagnio for a day or two; but I sent privately for my uncle's clerk, that had endeavoured to prevent my b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing kidnapped, by put|ting a letter in my pocket, mentioned in the beginning of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to me according to my desire, but
<PB N="231" REF="046409_0229_10215FEA01005CE8">
was overjoyed and surprised to see me, though he hardly knew me at first, for I had not sent him my name.</P>
<P>He informed me that my uncle had been dead above a year, and left his estate to his eldest son, and his business to his youngest and him: but they would often talk of me, not believing I was in the land of the living; yet they had increased my small estate with their utmost care, intending, if ever I came back again, to restore it to me. I let him into my whole history, and he was very much pleased to hear that I had gained such a plentiful fortune. I got him to provide us convenient lodgings and private, for I did not intend to go abroad much; and also to go to the inn to fetch my servants.</P>
<P>My two Indians spoke English very well, and I had learnt them to write and read; and being in modern habits, they were not much gazed at.</P>
<P>The time being expired that I was to look into my com|mission, (as Donna Isabella called it) I resolved to break it open, having some curiosity. But it was gone, and, not|withstanding all my search, I could not gain any tidings of it. I could not imagine how I should lose that and noth|ing else. I must own I was very uneasy, fearing it might be something of importance I was to do for Donna Isabella; therefore I dispatched a letter to Italy to tell them of my safe arrival, and my loss of the packet, and to send me a fresh one, with directions where to write to me.</P>
<P>While I staid in town I purchased an estate of 2,000l. a year in Somers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tshire, and yet had 25,000l. left, which I employed in the publik funds. And now I had se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">led my estate, as well as the affairs of Don Ferdinand. I was wil|ling to forward him in his studies, and proposed to send him to Oxford with a tutor. But he still begged to stay a little longer with me.</P>
<P>I therefore took a resolution of going to Bristol, only with Don Ferdinand and one servant, with no other business than to see the place where my lost treasu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> once lived.</P>
<P>When we were arrived, I enquired which was the house that Mr. Villars, late merchant, formerly dwelt in. We
<PB N="232" REF="046409_0230_10215FED3862B528">
soon found it out, but were informed one Captain Kendrick dwelt there. I was inquisitive to know if there was any tidings of one Susan, who was formerly maid to Miss Vil|lars, daughter to the deceased merchant, and at last got in|formation that she lived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> country-house near the sea-side.</P>
<P>I went immediately away for the place, though near thirty miles off, and late in the evening. Before we had rode far the skies became gloomy, and a violent storm threatened us, which soon overtook us with so much fury, that we were for|ced to put into a little house out of the road for shelter. When we came within, we could not see any body in it but a little child, playing with some toys it had before it; and all we could get out of it was, that Mamma would come by and by. It was as lovely a child as ever I saw, and we were still admiring it when a man and woman came in. They were much amazed to find us there; but I beg|ged their pardon, and told them the storm drove us in to take shelter.</P>
<P>The man told us we were very welcome to such as his house afforded, but he feared we should find but poor ac|commodation. In short, the storm kept up i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, its full force, and now it grew dark, and we were two miles from any inn; and to add to our distress, we were strangers to the road. The man seeing us so put to it, told us he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut two beds, but we should be welcome to them such as they were.</P>
<P>I told him I would gratify him for his trouble, and there|upon gave him a guinea. He was very well pleased with my present, and began to shew it in his looks, as well as the woman. I gave him another, to provide us something to eat, and to take care of our horses. He said he had but bad stable-room, but if I pleased he would take my servant, and all the horses, with one of his own, to bring him back again, and leave them at an inn in the neighbouring village. I agreed to it, and while he was gone, I asked the good woman many questions about the child which we saw there, and soon found it was none of their own, but a gentlewoman's a stranger to them, and one they had never seen but once. Why, said I, how are you paid for the keeping of it? She seemed amazed at my question, and was some time before she answered me; but at last she said she was always very well paid.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="046409_0231_10215FEEF6E33948">
I finding she did not much care for talking upon that subject, changed the discourse. Soon after the man came in, we went to supper. I would have had Don Ferdinand to have lain with me; but the man understanding we usual|ly lay asunder, would give us both beds, and they would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it up. I asked them where the child lay, and they told me in a cradle. I began to be concerned for the infant, though without giving any reason. When we had supped, we went to bed, and had but little rest; and when we rose in the morning. (it proving fair and pleasant) we re|solved to walk to the inn where our horses were, with our host for our guide. When we arrived, I dismissed him with another guinea, and would have got immediately on horse-back, but Don Ferdinand was so very much disordered that he was not able to mount. I was very much concerned for his indisposition, and begged he would repose himself there, while I pursued my journey, with a promise to re|turn the next day, or send my servant for him. He con|sented that it should be so, and I set forward.</P>
<P>Coming to a place where several roads met, I was con|founded to know the right, and therefore was some time at a stand, not knowing which to take: But hearing several voices in an adjacent barn, I made up to it on foot, giv|ing my horse to my man. The nearer I approached, the more noise they made; but I could not understand them. This awakened my curiosity, and I stole softly to the barn, where I could observe, through a crevice, (unseen) upwards of twenty gypsies, sitting in a huddle, with a child in the midst, stark naked, which they were rubbing over with wal|nut shells; and every time it cried, they set up that con|fused noise: But I was very much surprised to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in that child the features of that I had seen the night before at my country landlord's. I beckoned my servant to come near with my horses; being armed, I made to the barn-door, and forced it open. I asked them in an imperious manner, what they were doing with the child; and farther, affirm|ing they had stole it from such a place, giving them to un|derstand I had people coming to apprehend them. Upon hearing this, they all took to their heels; and some (I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound) that had come there with crutches, ran very nimbly away without them; but the child was left behind. I now be|gan to consider with myself what I had done, and that I had gotten a child, but did not know what to do with it. They
<PB N="234" REF="046409_0232_10215FF170816F48">
had rubbed the poor thing all over with the green walnut-shells, that made him look like one of their fraternity. By good fortune they had left his clothes behind them, as also some rags, which I suppose were to be put on instead of the others.</P>
<P>My man and I dressed it as well as we could, and aukwardly enough, but when we had finished (notwithstanding my haste) I resolved to go back again, and enquire into the affair. When we came to the inn, I gave the infant to the care of the wo|man of the house till my return; and understanding Don Fer|dinand was gone to rest, I proceeded to my host's house with|out disturbing him. When we arrived there, I met the wo|man at the door. Pray, said I to her, good woman, where is the child that I saw here last night? Where is the child? the woman replied sharply, why, the child's in his cradle asleep. Let me see it, said I. No, said she, I won't disturb it for you nor no one else. I told her peremptorily I would see it that instant, in spite of her, for I feared some foul play. She find|ing me resolute, and alighting from my horse, said, Well, Sir, since you are so desirous, I'll go and bring it to you. When she was gone, I began to imagine myself mistaken, and that children might be very like, without being the same; but I knew a gui|nea would reconcile her to my rudeness. I staid waiting a con|siderable time, taken up with several thoughts, and not observing how long I had waited, till my man told me the old woman was long a coming. I began to call, and nobody answering, I order|ed him to go in, and seek for her. He came out again, and told me she was not in the house, nor any one else; but that he be|lieved she had slipped out of the back door, and got away through the garden. I began to think there was something very extraor|dinary in the adventure of the child, and resolved to be strict in the examination. I entered the house myself, and searched, but to no purpose. I sent my man in the mean time in pursuit of the woman, but he returned without her. There was never a neighbouring house to enquire nearer than the village where I left the child. So I had just got on horseback, in order to go back, when I perceived the man coming towards his own house. I spurred on to meet him, and he seemed much concerned. I seized him by the collar, and told him I came to secure him for the murder of the child I saw at his house last night. The man was in such a terrible fright at what I said, that he was more dead than alive. Sure, Sir, said he, it cannot be, it is not murdered.

frighted the poor fellow so much, that he told me, if I would have a little patience, he would tell me all he knew concerning it (still crying, I hope it is not murdered.) I told him the child was safe. We went back to his house, where, after the fellow had a little composed himself, he made the following relation:</P>
<P>About three years ago, a gentlewoman came to my wife, and made a bargain with her to keep this infant, and by paying us handsomely, we imagined it belonged to some person of distinc|tion, for we received ten pounds every quarter, and that before it was due. The lady would often take the child for a day or two, and return it again. My wife being a worldly woman, laid several plots how to know the child's extraction, but to no pur|pose; for, by all circumstances, we believed the parents did not care for owning it. One day my wife told me she had a design in her head, but she would not disclose it till she could be sure of succeeding; and when the lady came the next time to take the child away for a day as usual, my wife was in conference with her for some time. And when she was gone, she told me that she had prevailed upon the lady to pay her one hundred pounds before-hand, and that she brought her to it, by telling her we would make a purchase of the house we live in. In short, my wife who wears the breeches, made me consent to carry on the deceit: and the next day the lady brought the child, and the hundred pound, and gave it my wife, without any thing under my hand, and left us in a small time after. When she was gone, my wife discoursed to me after this manner:</P>
<P>Husband, we have now one hundred and fifty pounds, (for we had been very saving) besides our goods and cattle, which will fetch us one hundred more. With this money we may go into my country, which was the Isle of Man, and live contentedly all our lives, without any fear of bad crops and ill markets. Well, said I, but what will become of the child? I quickly found by her expressions, that she resolved to murder it. I was struck with horror at the proposition, and notwithstanding her violent tem|per, opposed her in it; and told her upon no conditions would I consent to do so barbarous a deed. I found her so sixt upon the design of murder, that I was at last, as the lightest evil, obli|ged to consent to her selling it to a company of gypsies, but with the greatest reluctance in the world, which was executed this morning. But we had disposed of every thing before-hand, with
<PB N="236" REF="046409_0234_10215FF6B964EEA0">
intention to have gone to Bristol two days hence; for we were assured the lady would not come again for some time.</P>
<P>When he had done, I informed him how I came to meet with the child. I then began to examine if he did not know where the lady lived; and at last he confessed he dogged her to her house one day, set on by his wife, but would never discover it to her, for fear of her playing some trick. I prevailed with him to go with me, and shew me the house, with the promise of a re|ward, and letting him go afterwards. We set out, after he had got a horse, and in two hours arrived at a pleasant house, sur|rounded by a small river, and almost covered with trees. I stop|ped some time to view it, and through a little avenue saw two women gathering flowers; one had her face turned towards us, which the man said was the woman that used to come to see the child, and that was the place she carried it to. I ordered my man to take the horses to the next town, about half a mile off, and come to me again. But I needed not have bid my host to have gone about his business; for he, being fearful of the event, got away without our perceiving it.</P>
<P>When my man was gone, I walked about to view the house, but I had lost sight of the women, and it began to rain again. I stood up for shelter from the weather under a large oak, and had but just got there, when a woman came out of the gate with her mistress's service to invite me in. I was very well pleased with the invitation, and went into the house, where I was met by the gentlewoman, a very handsome lady. She told me, as I looked like a gentleman, she desired I would take shelter there till the storm was over. I returned her the thanks her civility deserved, and we sat down, but were immediately interrupted with a ringing at the gate; and I perceived through a small win|dow, a gentleman in a scarlet cloak alight from his horse, and go in quite through the house. The lady begged my pardon, and told me, she was obliged to keep another lady company, whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that person was there, but would wait on me as soon as possible again. As my curiosity had brought me there, I had no thoughts of going away till I had satisfied it in some measure. I could hear the man's voice very plain, who seemed to threaten a lady with a great many hardships as to her fortune, if she would not consent to his love. The lady answered in so low a voice, that I could not hear what she said, but I found her answers did but enrage him the more. They talked a great while, and at last they seemed to be silent. I hearing the door open, stopped
<PB N="237" REF="046409_0235_10215FF9D87B3258">
back into the room where the lady had left me. She came to me again, and sat down. I hope, Sir, said she, you'll pardon my rudeness, but I could not wait on you before. Madam, I replied, I ought to beg your pardon, for taking possession of your house here, who am an utter stranger to you. We were interrupted in our compliments by the voice of a person that screamed out Mur|der! murder! We both ran out, and coming to the door where the noise was, we found it shut, and the voice still calling out for help. I burst it open with my foot, and with my sword in my hand, ran into the room, where I found the gentleman that came in the cloak endeavouring to force a lady. I gave him a stroke on the head, and bid him turn about and defend himself; which he did, with many bitter exclamations. But after several passes, I had the good fortune to disarm him; and he having re|ceived several wounds, dropped down with the loss of blood. The lady he had attempted was still in a swoon; and the bustle had brought several women-servants into the room. I retired into the chamber I came from, but desired the lady to take some care of the wretch, who deserved death; but I wished he might survive, to prevent further trouble. She took my advice, and sent to the next town for a surgeon, who soon came, and my man along with him by accident. Perceiving his wounds were not dangerous, (for I stood by while the surgeon dressed him) and finding the house in too much confusion to be better informed concerning the child, I was about to take my leave. But the lady I had so timely rescued, having recovered her fright, desired she might thank me for so great a providence. I was easily per|suaded to stay, and immediately a lady came into the room. But, good God! what transports did I feel, when in that lady I be|held every feature of dear Miss Villars. Our eyes were fixed upon each other, and the sight of me raised such a tumult of joy in her breast, that, combating with her unsettled heart, she fell down in a swoon again. The other lady at first knew not the meaning of our disorder; but when I called her my dear wife, and other extravagant expressions of my love, she soon guessed the truth, and seemed as much transported as we were. Words would but wrong the sentiments we felt for each other. There|forefore let the reader, if possible, guess the joy of two lovers meeting after imagining each other no longer in this world. We thought it was all a dream; but at last, being sweetly convinced of the reality, we sent privately for the parson, and were tied by the outward ceremony of the church, whose hearts had been di|vinely
<PB N="238" REF="046409_0236_10215FFB63B34070">
united long before; and that night, I once more took pos|session of what I valued above all the world could give.</P>
<P>The next day, I sent for Don Ferdinand to partake in our joy, but was informed his indisposition had increased upon him so much, that it was dangerous to remove him. This was some al|lay to our joy, for I had a real friendship for him. I told my dear wife the obligation I had to his father. I now desired to know the particulars of her wonderful escape, which she related to me after the following manner:</P>
<P>You know, said she, when we parted at Mequinez, our hearts foreboded something would follow prejudicial to our loves. I was not acquainted with Mustapha's escape; if I had, it is very probable, I might have avoided the misfortune that befel me; but he got a vessel to carry him to Sall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, (as he informed me when I was their prisoner again) and by the way met with his master Hamet, who wrote a letter to the governor of Mammora, and sent Mustapha with it, while he intended to wait near the coast to guard us back. When they had seized me, they hurried me away immediately on board a vessel, and sailed upon the in|stant; and before night met with Hamet, where I was carried on board. He upbraided me in terms that gave me to expect worse treatment from him; but I told him, rather than submit to his nauseous love, I would starve myself to death, if I could find no other means to rid me of my life. The next day, a storm arising of a sudden, blew down one of their masts, and drove them back again; within sight of Mammora; but to avoid it, they ran beyond it, and the storm continued. In the evening it began to abate, and he steered his course back again; but before it was dark, a ship appeared in view. And notwithstanding he had lost several men in a former engagement, he resolved to set upon this vessel; and it growing calm, he got up to her with rowing. The other vessel knowing what she was, began with us first, and fired very briskly.</P>
<P>The fight continued about an hour, as near as I could guess; for all my employment was to pray that some lucky shot would end my life, which was so burdensome to me. When the noise of the ordnance ceased, I had not curiosity enough to go to see how affairs stood. But judge my surprise and pleasure, when I tell you the first man that entered the cabin, was the mate that I bad made captain, as I mentioned to you in the relation of my first misfortune.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="046409_0237_10215FFD24338078">
How, madam! cried he, is it you! thank Heaven my voyage is at an end. Come, Madam, continued he, I'll carry you to one who thinks her life a burden till you are safe, as your danger is owing to her. I had not power to return him an answer, or ask him who it was he meant, I was so confounded with thought. He carried me on board of his own ship, where he brought Miss Susan to me. My heart was so full of joy, that for a moment you had slipt out of my memory.</P>
<P>The ship of Hamet's was just sinking, for they had shot her be|tween wind and water, and could not come to stop it. They had taken out as many of their goods as the time would permit, and all the men that were wounded before she sunk. I let them into your story, and the mutual affection we had; and in return the captain gave me the following account of their getting away from Sallee.</P>
<P>You know, Madam, said he, the Moors were not very strict in searching us; and I had at the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of them, (judging what they were) secured all the merchants' money designed for trade as well as what I had of my own, about my cloaths, and in a great fur-cap, which I wore upon my head.</P>
<P>Hamer being satisfied with you, and what he found besides, would not fell us for slaves, but gave us the liberty of walking about the town, with a small allowance of provision, till we could send a person to England, for a thousand pounds, which was the ransom of both ship and men. In a little time, I became ac|quainted with one of the Jews of Sallee, whom I prevailed upon, by the force of money, to buy the ship, and pay for our ransom, which he did, without any one's concerning themselves about it. We did all we could to find you out, but to no purpose: so we were obliged to set sail for England.</P>
<P>In car voyage home, Miss Susan informed me with your story, not concealing even her own part in it; and I found her so sin|cere in her repentance, that I could not help pitying her, which soon became a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> passion, and when we arrived in England, the ceremony of the church compleated my happiness. We ac|quainted Ms. Kendrick, your ladyship's guardian and steward, with your misfortune; who, with the advice of us, fitted out the ship in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with a sufficient quantity of money for your ransom, if it were possible for us to hear of you; and by meeting with you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, we have comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">led what we intended. I return|ed
<PB N="240" REF="046409_0238_102160011AA42120">
them many thanks, (especially Miss Susan, who would accom|pany her husband, in hopes to meet with me.) I desired captain Morrice, (which was the name of Miss Susan's husband) to steer towards Mammora, but he told me it was no safe: for as there was a war proclaimed between France and England, the ambassa|dor could not answer for it if he did not make us a prize; and we were further informed by one of the renegado prisoners, that he was very well assured they were sailed for France.</P>
<P>Upon this notice we directed our course with this hope, that you would soon arrive in England, and find me out; for I re|membered, in the story of my misfort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nes, I gave you marks enough to let you know where I was to be found. Before we made the English coast, I found myself with child, and the very imagination had like to have cost me my life, for fear the father of the unborn infant would not come time enough to save my credit; for though I was well assured of your honour, yet I knew the censuring world would be apt to blame my conduct. I could hide nothing from the faithful Susan, who joined her fears with mine.</P>
<P>When we came into Bristol channel, I consulted with Susan about my management, and I at last resolved to live private, till I could hear some news of you. But I was obliged to let Mr. Kendrick my steward into the knowledge of my arrival, though he was a stranger to my condition.</P>
<P>I sent to London, in hopes of hearing some news of you; but you having kept the name of your uncle secret in your relation our endeavours proved fruitless.</P>
<P>My melancholy increased with my condition; and for fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a discovery, I went into Wales, with a relation of Miss Susan's, and was delivered of a boy, that proved the greatest comfort of my sinking heart; for in his face was every feature of his dear father. I brought him back again here, and had put him to nurse, as a child to a relation of Miss Susan's, and had resolved but this very day to have sent for him home, that I might always have the satisfaction of having him in my sight.</P>
<P>My steward finding I was under a necessity of living private, began to talk to me of love; and often proceeded so far (after finding I disdained his passion) to tell me, if I would not consent to make him my husband, he would take care my estate should
<PB N="241" REF="046409_0239_1021600369E22EE8">
come into his hands. Though I could have soon broke his de|signs as to my fortune, yet my solitary dwelling pleased me so well, that I gave him good words, which did but more encou|rage his insolence, till it arrived at that pitch you so happily de|livered me from.</P>
<P>I soon found, by my wife's relation, that the infant I had so marvelously saved was our own child. When I related the ac|cident of meeting with the child, my wife expressed so much fear, terror, tenderness, and joy, that I thought the different passions would have taken away her understanding. By this we may learn, there is a ruling providence that regulates every action of our lives, when they tend to virtue.</P>
<P>Mr. Kendrick (the person that made the attempt upon my wife) was soon informed of our happy meetings; and his wounds mending every day, he begged we would favour him with a visit, which we complied with, when he asked pardon for all past of|fences in such a sincere manner, that we were easily prevailed up|on to forgive him.</P>
<P>He sent for all the books of accounts and writings that belong|ed to my wife's estate, and delivered them up to us.</P>
<P>The same day, Captain Morrice arrived from France; where he went by the desire of my wife, as her last hope, to know if he could gain any intelligence of me. He was so very diligent in his commission, that he got to the speech of Monsieur de St. O|lon, who informed him or my pursuing the vessel, and returning, and of my voyage to Italy. I rewarded him by several handsome presents for his trouble, and found in all his actions, a downright blunt sincere honesty, which drew me into a friendship for him. I now began to think of Don Ferdinand's illness, and resolved to go with my wife to make him a visit; and my dear wife was so impatient to embrace the child, she would not let me stay to fin|ish my affairs with Mr. Kendrick.</P>
<P>As we were upon our journey, we were met by a relation of mine, son to that barbarous uncle that had kidnapped me. He was in the country when I arrived at London. Notwithstanding the injury I had suffered from his father, I could not help receiv|ing him with the utmost affection: for we were both of an age, and very like as to our persons, being brought up together till
<PB N="242" REF="046409_0240_10216004F4362E30">
the death of my father, which created a friendship for each other.</P>
<P>He brought me a packet from Italy, and in it one inclosed from Don Jaques, sent from St. Salvador. I broke open that first, which was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>I HOPE the distance of climates has no force upon your friendship; mine here has rather received an addition, though I am overwhelmed with a very great misfortune. My daughter (in whom all my hopes centered) is, I fear, entirely lost: for the very day you left us, was the last time my eyes beheld her. We have some reason to fear the relations of the person who died by your sword, have used some clandestine means, and perhaps have privately murdered her, to be reven|ged on us for that accident, though of their own seeking. In short, I am weary of this hateful place, and shall do my endea|vour to seek repose in some other part of the world; and rely|ing upon your good-natured friendship, I hope to have the hon|our very shortly after your receiving this, to embrace you in England, for I am preparing to leave St. Salvador with the soonest.

</LETTER>
<P>What words can express the amazement I felt at the reading this last letter! My thoughts were confounded in reflection, and a chaos of ideas possessed my brain. I was in so much confusion, that I thought of returning home again, to consider of this strange turn. Recollected circumstances convinced me how blind I was in not discovering it sooner. My soul was immediately filled with the most tender pity; and I had not the use of words to de|clare my sentiments to my wife and cousin. Sometimes I would imagine it was all a fictitious dream: yet at last I was not dis|pleased, that I had it in my power to restore to Don Jaques his long lost daughter. My wife was as much concerned as I was, and my cousin could hardly be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ieve it. I soon found that she had taken care the packet should not fall in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> my hands; and that convinced me she would not have her disguise discovered. The next day we resolved to visit her, and form my resolution from my observation.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the inn, we found her dressed at a table, with paper, pens, and ink before her. She saluted them, and seemed mightily pleased with my good fortune, and was very much concerned her indisposition would not admit of her waiting on me, to partake in my contentment. Her weakness was so prevalent that she could hardly utter her words. She knew noth|ing of my receiving the packet from my cousin; but after we had sat some time. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her the letter from her father; which, as soon as she had read, she fell backward upon the bed in a swoon.</P>
<P>The noise we made at this accident brought several people into the room; and among the rest my landlady, who it seems, had fell desperately in love with her, as imagining her to be a man. She made such outward complainings, that if our minds had been at ease, she would have produced much mirth; but among her actions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> buttoned her cloaths, to give her breath, and soon
<PB N="245" REF="046409_0243_1021600D5DD53500">
discovered her mistake in the object of her wishes. When she found by her breasts that she&punc; was a woman, she ran down the stairs with the utmost precipitation, and left us alone to recover her. When we had brought her to her senses again, she soon found that we had discovered her sex; and the grief and shame at the accident had like to have thrown her again into her swoon|ing. It was some time before we could bring her to herself; but she found by my discourse, that I understood the whole secret.</P>
<P>After a long pause, she said, I did not intend to let my frailty be known to you till after my death; but since it is discovered, I beg you will have some regard to my memory, and I shall die contented. I begged her not to talk of death, but live to com|fort her grieved parents. It is too late, said she, to talk of any comfort, for I have called my greatest friend, Death, to my aid, who is just now arrived. Upon uttering these words, a deadly paleness possessed her face, and trembling seized her limbs; she had just strength enough to declare to us that she had taken a dose of poison, provided for the occasion, bought of an apothe|cary of the town; and that she was just going to write a letter to me, but was prevented by our sudden appearance, whose contents were only to see her secretly buried, and, if possible, to conceal her sex and story from the world. She had hardly made an end, before her speech forsook her, and life in all appearance fled the beauteous dwelling. My wife was not present at this accident, her eager desire having carried her to her child; but she came in before it was over. My cousin seemed more oppressed with grief than any of us, for love had taken full possession of his heart.</P>
<P>While sorrow had locked up all our tongues, the apothecary came in, in a strange confusion; for the report had soon dispers|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">self all over that little village. Sir, said he to me, don't be concerned at the condition you see the gentleman in, for he is not dead, he has only took a sleeping po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">on. I partly guessed his design, when he applied to me for poison; and the extraordinary price he paid for it, convinced me it was for some sinister design, and therefore I happily imposed upon him.</P>
<P>This news revived us all again, especially my cousin, who I thought would have gone distracted for joy; and to see him impa|tient watching for her life's return, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we may call i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ly gave me further proof that one look, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> sufficient to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> love for|ever in the soul. The apothecary, during this interval of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> into her mouth, to help the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="246" REF="046409_0244_1021600FAF13D970">
and at last she opened her unwilling eyes, and gazed around her as if she had been in the other world: but we soon convinced her of the apothecary's deceit, at which she seemed in the utmost confusion, and gave us to understand that life was forced upon her against her inclination, and she should shake it off.</P>
<P>We gave her all the comfort we were capable of, and my wife told her, if she talked any longer of death, it was only that she could not bear to see us happy. This as it were roused her from her lethargy. Well then, said she, I will live, if it be only to convince you that I am pleased to see my captain blessed; for she would always call me so. After we had a little composed her, we left her with my cousin to look after my child, who was in the same place; which had proved the secret instinct of na|ture; for at the first sight in the house of his unnatural nurse, I could not help feeling a tender regard for him. When we had satisfied our inn, we prevailed upon Donna Blanca (now no longer Ferdinand) to come into the coach with us, and we arrived that evening at Bristol; where we took possession of the house (which Captain Kendrick had lived in) that belonged to my wife. We staid some time there to settle my wife's affairs, and as much to recover Donna Blanca's indisposition.</P>
<P>My cousin by his assiduity, gained very much of her esteem, but she freely declared, she had no room in her heart for love; but notwithstanding, with much importunity, we prevailed upon her to accept him for a husband, and her esteem soon came up to a more tender passion. As soon as the ceremony was over, we took a journey to London to settle our affairs there, and provide for my expected guests.</P>
<P>One morning, as we were pursuing our journey, coming near the skirts of a wood, we heard several groans, which alarmed us; but as we had too many people about us armed to fear any thing, we came out of the coach to know the reason&punc; where we found a woman weltering in blood, being stabbed in several places with a sword. When I came to take a nearer view, I found it was the wife of my former master, (the watch-maker.) I could not help having compassion for any person, in that condition, therefore or|dered her to be taken up and put in the coach. Donna Blanca opened her breast, and stopped up her wounds as well as she could, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll we could get a surgeon that I had ordered to be sent for. She soon knew me, and cried out, Sure heaven has sent you, that know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay guilt, to be witness of my repentance. The wrongs I have

done my husband have pursued me to my grave. When I had robbed him of all I could lay my hands on, I made my escape to Ireland, changed my name, and set up for a greater fortune than I really was. I had many suitors, but heaven, to punish me, made me place my affections on a person that courted me for my mon|ey: and though I soon understood he had but a very little estate, yet love prevailed with me to make him my husband. He soon spent both his own and my fortune, and by contracting many debts was forced to fly for England; and finding no relief, took to the highway, where he has committed many robberies. He lodged me in a neighbouring village; but our place of meeting was gen|erally in this wood, for fear of a discovery. This morning he came, according to appointment, where he began his discourse af|ter this manner: I had no inclinations for you when I first mar|ried you, but now I utterly abhor you, therefore I am resolved to part with you; but I have another reason besides my hatred to you, which is this; I have it in my power to marry an old wo|man very rich; and therefore it is necessary to send you out of the world, for fear our marriage should come to her ears, and spoil my fortune. He followed his discourse with these wounds which he gave me, and rode into the wood; I not once offering to open my mouth; for astonishment had tied up my tongue. I told her, I hoped heaven had given her all her punishment in this world. That's all the hope I have, said she, in my unfeigned re|pentance; for I feel death approaching. We observed she was just expiring; and before the surgeon came, she gave up her last breath, calling upon heaven for mercy. I gave orders for her fu|neral, and sent after the murderer, but to no purpose. But I heard he was taken on the highway, some time after, and execu|ted at Worcester, where he confessed the murder of his wife. Thus we see the hand of heaven, though slow in punishment, yet always overtakes the guilty. When I had given directions for her funeral, we pursued our journey, and arrived safe at London.</P>
<P>Don Antonio and his lady arrived first in a private capacity; not caring to make a show according to their birth, to be taken no|tice of. And in a few days after came Don Jaques and his lady, in a ship of their own, in company with the Isabella, which my lieutenant commanded, that had sprung a leak, which obliged her to put into Lisbon to refit, where Don Jaques joyfully met with her.</P>
<P>I had desired Donna Blanca once more to put on her boy's cloaths; for I intended agreeably to surprise her parents.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="046409_0246_10216013F217AF48">
I was obliged to take lodgings for Don Jaques's family, they intending to take a convenient house in the city. As soon as mu|tual caresses were over, grief again took possession of their souls for the loss of their child. After condoling with them for some time, I begged them to hope for the best, and that it was possible to hear of her again. They shook their heads, and told me, that thought was long over, and they had no hope but in time to wear away their unhappy loss.</P>
<P>I told them I had a kinsman (as much as I could remember the features of their beautiful daughter) as like her as a man could be like a woman. They expressed a great desire to see him. I told them I had invited him with another relation to sup with us on purpose. We had taken care before, that Donna Blanca should ombre her face, and speak nothing but English, on purpose to carry on the deceit. Till the time of their coming, we spent it in relating our accidents in the voyage. I told them how much I was surprised at the likeness of my cousin to their daughter; for I had given them to understand it was a relation I had never seen before I left England, which was truth.</P>
<P>When the time I had appointed came, Donna Blanca and my cousin entered. I presented them to Don Jaques and his wife, as my relations, and they saluted them as utter strangers. But when they saw and heard Donna Blanca, they burst into tears at the great resemblance in both voice and features, as they said, to their daughter. She carried it on as long as she could, speaking Eng|lish all the white; but at last her tears prevailed so much upon her tenderness, that she begged leave to retire, but would return immediately. I made an apology for my kinsman to Don Jaques and his wife, and told them he would return in a very little time. The space of their absence was filled with sighs and tears: and as I knew their grief would be soon over, never attempted to com|fort them.</P>
<P>When they were ready they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a servant to tell me a gen|tleman wanted to speak with me. I retired, came in again im|mediately, and told them our company would be increased, for another relation and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were just coming in to sup with us; and upon that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> leading by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Don|na Blanca.

joy by tears, kisses, and embraces; and his lady coming to her|self, had like to have stifled her with her transports.</P>
<P>They did not ask any reasonable questions till the torrent of their joy was poured out. After the first transports were over, Donna Blanca told her own story. She said, the first time I di|ned at their house at St. Salvador, love flew into her heart; and knowing the modesty due to her sex, she was resolved never to discover it till she found the state of mine; yet finding her pas|sion daily increase, and understanding the day of my departure, she procured secretly the habit of a man, with all other necessa|ries, and conveyed herself on board the boat that carried the pres|ents her father had sent me; and counterfeited the letter she gave me as from her father. Every thing answered my wish, said she, but I soon found my captain had no heart to bestow. It is need|less to tell how many bitter sighs and tears that knowledge cost me; but it is now buried in oblivion. Then she proceeded to beg their pardon for her rash folly, as she called it; and they were too much overjoyed not to forgive her every thing; and they expressed a great deal of satisfaction in that they could now call me a relation. We lived in all the contentment imaginable, returning heaven our grateful thanks for its bounteous mercy. And now I am settled, I'll take leave of my reader with this couplet of the poet:
<Q><L><HI>O never let a virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s mind d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">spair,</HI></L>
