<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR illu&s;trious Performance exhibited to the Public on that mo&s;t important que&s;tion, whether <HI>A&mdash;a</HI> was known to the A&mdash;s, reflects the highe&s;t honor not only to you but to your ancient, worthy, and ve|nerable Predece&s;&s;ors, and may well be tacked as an appendix to the wondrous Magnalia: Herein is verified that &s;aying, Every genera|tion grows wi&s;er and wi&s;er. It mu&s;t afford am|ple &s;atisfaction not only to the inqui&s;itive Gen|tleman you mean to gratify, but fill the whole world with wonder and amazement at the gro&s;s &s;tupidity and indolence of many centu|ries pa&s;t. Worthy and great Writers have al|ways had envious opponents, and in propor|tion to their great and &s;erviceable di&s;cove|ries and endeavors for the welfare of the com|munity expect their attacks: But what &s;hall we &s;ay of &s;uch men who are continually emitting their contagious poi&s;on? You doubt|le&s;s remember the &s;aying of the Poet,
<Q><L>&mdash;Jam &s;aevus apertam,</L>
<L>In rabiem caepit verti jocus et per hone&s;tas</L>
<L>Ire minax impun&eacute; domos.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays a libel in his day, which took
<PB N="6" REF="012965_0004_0F9040FC0C5EA810">
away a man's good name was puni&s;hed with death. By this means the honor of families are ruined, and highe&s;t po&s;ts and greate&s;t titles are rendered cheap and vile in the &s;ight of the people, the noble&s;t virtues and mo&s;t exalted parts expo&s;ed to the contempt of the vicious and ignorant. And as this cruel prac|tice tends to the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of all truth and humanity among us, it de&s;erves the ut|mo&s;t dete&s;tation, abhorrence and di&s;courage|ment of all who have either the love of their country or the honor of their religion at heart.
<Q><L>He who filches from me my good name,</L>
<L>Enriches not him&s;elf, but makes me poor indeed.</L>
<BIBL>Shak</BIBL></Q>
The&s;e men together with their adherents who take plea&s;ure in reading them, may be ju&s;tly ranked with the murderer and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. Every good man &s;ets as high a value on his name as on his life, and tho&s;e who privily a&s;&s;ault the one would de&s;troy the other, could they do it with the &s;ame &s;ecrecy and impunity. How many there are of this character among us public pamphets and news-papers mani|fe&s;tly evince. <HI>O tempora! O mores!</HI></P>
<P>I need not here remind you of the va&s;t di&s;proportion between a libel again&s;t gover|ment and a private member of community. That you may be armed again&s;t an a&s;&s;ault of this nature, remember that a private de&s;ire of re&s;entment &s;ubdued denominates a man great, And that if you are led away with the cen|&s;ures or applau&s;es of men, when wi&s;dom &s;hall be ju&s;tified of her children you will be found de&s;ti|tute of tho&s;e graces which adorn human nature.</P>
<P>Having had an opportunity of knowing
<PB N="7" REF="012965_0005_0F9040FCC06A0C70">
the &s;entiments, with regard to your motives, of a number of per&s;ons of the above de&s;crib|ed character, I &s;hall here pre&s;ent you a &s;peci|men of a few of them for your animadver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay you have catched an epidemical di&s;temper called by <HI>Juvenal</HI> an itch of writing.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay you have long in vain been in pur&s;uit of a Diploma from <HI>North-Britain,</HI> but de&s;pi&s;ing the modern method of obtaining it, continue impatiently &s;eeking it through the channel of merit.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay you expre&s;&s;ed a huge fancy to be cho&s;e Pre&s;ident of <HI>Harvard</HI>-College, and that you are now endeavoring to convince the ho|norable Electors of their egregious mi&s;take in not calling you to that important tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay you are encouraged from the effects of a former harangue on Liberty, pro|ductive of a boon.</P>
<P>Others that one of the BEST of men is the intended object of your keen re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Others that you are employed as a Popi&s;h Incendiary to foment &s;trife.</P>
<P>Others are &s;o ill natured as to &s;ay you are influenced by the fair Daughters of Liberty, on who&s;e account you have already &s;uffered a dire flogging at an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council.</P>
<P><HI>Cum multis aliis quae nunc pre&s;cribere</HI> won't do.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the &s;urmi&s;es of this rude herd with regard to your motives: Nor do I find their &s;entiments with regard to your mo&s;t excellent Performance more favorable; for in general they &s;ay, their expectations be|ing rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch (from the name of the Author and grandeur of the &s;ub|ject)

they are as greatly di&s;appointed as at the production of <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s teaming mountain.</P>
<P>You'll need abundance of grace and pa|tience while I tran&s;cribe their arguments again&s;t you. The learned <HI>Keckerman,</HI> you &s;ay, judges that <HI>A&mdash;a</HI> was known to the A&mdash;ts. They &s;ay you begin well; but you &s;hould have let them known he was infallible. You go on and &s;ay, if the matter be examin|ed with judgment and proper care and ac|curacy, we &s;hall find rea&s;on to believe that this large part of the world was <HI>really</HI> known to the A&mdash;ts.</P>
<P>How hone&s;t <HI>Madoc</HI> came to take it into his head to vi&s;it <HI>A&mdash;a</HI> you don't know, nor how he got out of it you can't tell; but he left monuments of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> language and cu&s;toms. What of the language found a|mong the <HI>Indians</HI> you do not &s;ay; nor cu&s;toms, whether eating when hungry, or Prie&s;ts &s;porting with their female pari&s;hio|ners. But they a&s;k, upon &s;uppo&s;ition it were true that <HI>Madoc</HI> was in <HI>A&mdash;a,</HI> does that prove your point?</P>
<P>As to <HI>E&s;lotiland,</HI> it being agreed by all to be part of <HI>A</HI>&mdash;, as you &s;ay, the point mu&s;t be given up, as it was di&s;covered by the <HI>Frizeland</HI> Fi&s;hermen and the <HI>Polonian,</HI> ever &s;ince the year 1456: But they &s;ay you beg the que&s;tion, and it &s;eems they had &s;uch a knowledge of it, that they nor their neighbors ever troubled their heads any further with it.</P>
<P><HI>L. Anneus Seneca,</HI> you &s;ay, foretold that another world &s;hould be found out, and in one of his dramatic pieces, &s;ays, <HI>Thyphis</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="012965_0007_0F9041009232EB98">
&s;hould di&s;cover new worlds; but what that can be to your purpo&s;e they can't tell, unle&s;s he did di&s;cover new Worlds and <HI>A&mdash;a</HI> was included in the number.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Metellius Celer,</HI> Procon&s;ul of <HI>Gaul</HI> having a number of <HI>Indians</HI> pre&s;ented him by the <HI>Suevian</HI> King, you imagine them waf|ted by violent gales of long continuance (they &s;uppo&s;e in <HI>Indian</HI> canoes with large &s;tores of provi&s;ions) from <HI>Labrador</HI> or <HI>Newfoundland</HI> to the <HI>German</HI> &s;hore. This &s;eems to appear very &s;trange to 'em&punc; and fancy they mu&s;t have had wet hides now and then: But they &s;eem inclined to think you are not well &s;kill'd in the geography of this part of the globe, or with the turbulence of the atlantic ocean, and rather think they came from <HI>Lunar He&s;peria,</HI> as frogs are &s;aid to de&s;cend <HI>ex nubibus</HI> in a &s;hower of rain. But &s;uppo&s;e it true, what kind or degree of knowledge could the <HI>Sue|vians</HI> have had from tho&s;e rude &s;avages?</P>
<P>Mention, you &s;ay, has been made repeat|edly of two i&s;lands called <HI>Atlantides,</HI> ten thou&s;and &s;tadia di&s;tant from <HI>Lybia,</HI> and cal|led by <HI>Pliny, He&s;perides,</HI> which the learned <HI>Ortellius</HI> &s;uppo&s;es to be the i&s;lands of <HI>Hi&s;pa|niola</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> and <HI>Diadorus Siculus</HI> tells us that the people of tho&s;e i&s;lands in habit places near the ocean, and therefore they mu&s;t be the inhabitants of <HI>Cuba</HI> becau&s;e &s;urrounded by the ocean.
<Q>Here were the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> fields, the &s;eat of the ble&s;&s;ed, and, as the above author &s;ays, the inhabitants were very hap|py indeed.</Q>
Logical arguing, de&s;ervant of a Pre&s;ident&s;hip!</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012965_0008_0F904101DB6686C0"><HI>Plato</HI> has given particular account, you &s;ay, of the <HI>Atlantic I&s;land,</HI> as publi&s;hed by <HI>Serranus,</HI> and of its being peopled by <HI>Neptune</HI> with chil|dren begot of a mortal woman. They &s;ay one would think you were in one of your youthful freaks, and imagined the gods were &s;ubject to like pa&s;&s;ions with your&s;elf. They &s;ay if they under&s;tand you right the argu|ment &s;tands thus: <HI>Neptune</HI> was an ancient god, from his nature mu&s;t have known the extent of his juri&s;diction, the atlantic ocean being bound we&s;t on the <HI>A&mdash;an</HI> &s;hore, of con&s;equence he mu&s;t have known it; there|fore <HI>A&mdash;a</HI> was known to the A&mdash;ts. That it received its name from King <HI>Atlas,</HI> and <HI>Hercules</HI> pillars was
<Q>its ea&s;tern bounds; that it was a mo&s;t broad i&s;land, had pow|erful kings, and what el&s;e they cannot tell, except they had grievous wars, in which the <HI>Athenians</HI> oppos'd them&s;elves and be|came conquerors. <HI>Plato,</HI> you &s;ay, is not &s;ingular herein, but <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> con|firm it.</Q>
They &s;ay you do them great honor. <HI>Plato</HI> &s;ays further, the greate&s;t i&s;land of the we&s;tern ocean was lo&s;t, &s;ituated be|tween the <HI>Azores</HI> and <HI>Canaries,</HI> and that there were
<Q>reliques of it, you &s;ay, <HI>Becman</HI> thought, believed, and &s;ays might be lengthily proved.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Hoffman</HI> and <HI>Bochart</HI> are of opinion that <HI>Plato</HI>'s atlantis is to many <HI>A&mdash;a</HI>: And indeed, you &s;ay, if it was larger than <HI>Lybia</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> it looks as if it were really <HI>A&mdash;.</HI></Q>
Thus you are endeavoring to prove, that what is now and ever was unknown to
<PB N="11" REF="012965_0009_0F90410200E913F8">
us a &s;unken i&s;land was known, in order to prove that the terra firma on which we now dwell was known to the A.....ts.</P>
<P>The probability ari&s;ing from the accounts of pa&s;&s;ages of ve&s;&s;els through the atlantic one way and the other mu&s;t be barely probable, and of <HI>Endoxus</HI>'s voyage in the days of our Grandfathers to <HI>Cales</HI> mu&s;t have been round by the edges as St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s voyages were, or by lucky chance.</P>
<P>But now you call, they &s;ay, to a re&s;pectful notice of <HI>Hanno,</HI> the famous <HI>Carthagenian,</HI> who wrote Periplum, which has not been your lot to &s;ee, and therefore can make no ob&s;ervations. 'Tis a pity! But you &s;ay he gives an account of a voyage pro&s;ecuted around the coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and found lands in the atlantic ocean. Surely it was a &s;pae|rical round, if he found any of the main of <HI>A.....a.</HI></P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not omit to take notice, that the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> mu&s;t have had the knowledge of it, for <HI>Diadorus Siculus</HI> beforementioned in his De fabulo&s;is antiquorum ge&s;tis) &s;ays, that certain <HI>Phoenicians</HI> were ca&s;t on a mo&s;t fertile i&s;land oppo&s;ite to <HI>Africa,</HI> and you, to accommodate your&s;elf, note that if it was oppo&s;ite to <HI>Africa</HI> it mu&s;t have been an <HI>A.....n</HI> i&s;land: But pray, Reverend Sir, with profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, why not one of the <HI>Azores,</HI> or even St. <HI>Helen'</HI>s? And if &s;o, no wonder the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> did not divulge <HI>A.....a</HI> to the <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>Upon &s;uppo&s;ition that <HI>Silenas</HI> gave <HI>Midas</HI> information, as you &s;ay, that <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="012965_0010_0F904102CBAAFFE0">
and <HI>Africa</HI> were i&s;lands, and of the exi&s;tence of another world who&s;e magnitude was im|men&s;e and infinite, will it follow from thence that <HI>A.....a</HI> was known to the A.....ts? Do not you Prie&s;ts preach up unknown worlds, and &s;ome of you live as though you were not willing to part with a certainty for an uncertainty?</P>
<P>As for <HI>Hanuo</HI>'s voyage beforerementioned, when you leave the <HI>Herculian</HI> pillars, the <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> you find about ten thou&s;and &s;tadia from <HI>Lybia</HI> the large i&s;lands of <HI>Atlantides</HI>; but go|ing again to reconnoitre them, on your return, &s;ay you can't find 'em, to your great di&s;ap|pointment, and conclude they are de&s;troyed by a flood or earthquake: Surely, they &s;ay, it mu&s;t have been <HI>Cape Flyaway,</HI> frequently &s;een by mariners in the atlantic ocean. And fur|ther, this voyage has mi&s;led you a thou&s;and &s;tadia from your point, and no wonder, &s;ince they mu&s;t have been de&s;titute of a compa&s;s: For leaving <HI>Lybia</HI> on the left (the coa&s;t lying nearly north and &s;outh) and &s;ailing thirty days (meet with impediments, and no doubt it was very lucky if they ever found their way back, though you don't &s;ay they ever did; but you might have made the &s;tory for them as you did for <HI>Madoc</HI>) &s;teer &s;outh. If <HI>Lybia</HI> was on the left their cour&s;e mu&s;t have been nearly &s;outh, notwith&s;tanding which, you imagine it probable that they mu&s;t have found &s;ome of the <HI>A&mdash;an</HI> i&s;lands, or &s;ome part of the we&s;tern continent it&s;elf, which they &s;ay must be as impo&s;&s;ible as for de&s;igning Prie&s;ts to receive the rewards of the faithful.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012965_0011_0F90410386993968"><HI>Grotius</HI>'s conception of the peopling <HI>A.....a</HI> from <HI>Europe</HI> (notwith&s;tanding what you have &s;aid of <HI>Serranus</HI>) upon &s;uppo&s;ition that <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> and <HI>Cuba</HI> were the &s;eats of the ble&s;&s;ed as you imagine, and as you &s;ay the rout is po&s;&s;ible and not unnatural, pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Europe</HI> through <HI>Norway</HI> into <HI>Iceland,</HI> thence by <HI>Frizeland</HI> into <HI>Greenland,</HI> and &s;o in|to <HI>E&s;totiland,</HI> mu&s;t needs make a dreary tra|vel for the heavenly Pilgrims: No wonder the emigrants never returned to give account of their &s;ituation, in this new <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> How greatly doth it dignify the Prie&s;thood that the rewards of virtue are &s;o much more ea&s;ily obtained in the&s;e modern days!</P>
<P>They readily allow that <HI>A&mdash;a</HI> was well peopled four or five thou&s;and years ago, and that when <HI>Columbus</HI> arrived here he found multitudes of inhabitants: But what is that to your purpo&s;e? You have been endeavor|ing to prove they originated from <HI>Europe,</HI> and where not, though they have cho&s;en to o|mit it 'till now. But does <HI>Columbus</HI> &s;ay he found any of his countrymen among them, any Whites, or any others that could give any account of their ri&s;e from <HI>Europe,</HI> or any o|ther of the known part of the globe? If he had you would undoubtedly have &s;nap'd at it, they &s;ay, to help you out of the &s;udds, and they wonder you did not a&s;&s;ert that he did.</P>
<P>As to your &s;uppo&s;itions, conjectures, and deductions with regard to <HI>Gog, Magog,</HI> &amp;c. they are &s;o various, and all drawn to help your important cau&s;e, they &s;ay they are not worthy an an&s;wer, and had you ever read
<PB N="14" REF="012965_0012_0F904104433559A0">
the 38th and 39th chapters of <HI>Ezek.</HI> you would have been better informed. How incon&s;i&s;tent the glorious ri&s;e of the we&s;tern empire from that race, with the 39th chap|ter from 11th to 17th ver&s;e, unle&s;s your fer|tile brain produces a Phoenix. But how|ever, there &s;eems to be one ob&s;ervation of Dr. <HI>Grew</HI>'s worthy of note, which you &s;eem to hug as making much to your point, name|ly, that there were no Blacks found in <HI>A.....a,</HI> and you therefore ob&s;erve there could be no removes from <HI>Africa.</HI> But pray, learned Sir, with defference to your &s;uperior knowledge in antiquity, were there found any Whites? and if not, why does not the argument bear as much again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed removes from <HI>Europe</HI>? But, pray Sir, how came the inha|bitants yellow? They are of opinion, you imagine, by their carrying on their backs large packs of provi&s;ion and nece&s;&s;ary cloath|ing for the performance of their long travel, as you have chaulk'd out the road, their hides by intermitting colds and heats were gra|dually tann'd and became &s;o.</P>
<P>As to what you advance from the Scrip|tures and progre&s;s of the Apo&s;tles, they leave your be&s;t friends to judge of its ab&s;urdity. How are the &s;acred Scriptures tortur'd and warp'd to ba&s;e purpo&s;es! No wonder they are held in &s;uch contempt by the unde&s;cerning part of mankind, when Prie&s;ts would cram down any thing for truth that &s;uits their turn; and they imagine your lugging in the Scriptures to help you (had you a common chance) would have been a great

The good e&s;teem of the High Sons, or in other words, a good reward is all you care for, they &s;ay. Commending your cunning to pre|vent drowning, you wi&s;ely omit touching on the tender point of Legi&s;lative Right as pa&s;t your depth; but, they &s;ay, you di&s;cover your &s;elf as well &s;kil'd in the my&s;tery of merchan|dize as in the &s;cience and art of geography and navigation, when you a&s;&s;ert that the <HI>A&mdash;ans</HI> have &s;uffer'd great lo&s;s by the <HI>Britons</HI> in their trade and commerce.
