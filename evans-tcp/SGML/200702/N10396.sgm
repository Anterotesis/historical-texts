<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT, BY THE ENGLISH EDITOR.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT is far from being the De&s;ign of this Pamphlet to ca|lumniate private Characters, or to inflame the Pa&s;|&s;ion of the Reader, by any bitter, per&s;onal Invectives. The Author intends nothing more, than to lay before the Pub|lic a fair and impartial State of Facts; and &s;ubmits the Propriety of the Conclu&s;ions drawn from tho&s;e Facts, to the cool Determination of every unbia&s;&s;ed Under&s;tanding. The Editor mo&s;t heartily concurs with the Author, in wi&s;h|ing that a due Attention to the &s;everal Con&s;iderations here|in &s;ugge&s;ted, may &s;erve to convince the unprejudiced, that the Oppo&s;ition of the</HI> Colonies <HI>to certain Mea&s;ures, did not owe its Ri&s;e to any Di&s;affection to the Mother Country, or Di&s;loyalty to their Sovereign&mdash;that it may al&s;o prevent the undue Influence of Mi&s;repre&s;entation&mdash;and prove, in &s;ome Degree, the happy Occa&s;ion of tempering the Deci&s;i|ons of the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Parliament, with an equitable Re&s;pect to the Claims of pa&s;t Services; and a candid Regard to the Jealou&s;ies and Re&s;entments, natural to a People who

<HEAD>A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE RISE, PROGRESS, SERVICES AND SUFFERINGS, OF NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>AMERICA, <HI>New-England</HI> in particular, was fir&s;t &s;ettled by a pious People from <HI>England,</HI> who were not allowed to wor&s;hip their Maker according to his In&s;titutions, in their native Country, without the Mixture of human Inventions. Animated therefore by the be&s;t of Principles, they were &s;pirited to attempt a Settlement at a Di&s;tance from <HI>Britain,</HI> that &s;o they might enjoy a Wor&s;hip purely Scriptural, and leave the &s;ame to their Po&s;terity. They accordingly provided all Things nece&s;&s;ary for their Removal, at their own Ex|pence, and &s;ailed for an unknown Country. Their fir&s;t Arrival was at <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> which is &s;ituated in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay;</HI> and they &s;at down at a Place they call <HI>New-Plymouth,</HI> utterly unknown, and in the advance of Winter. Wherever they turned their Eyes, the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s &s;urrounded them: Fatigued with their boi&s;terous Voyage, di&s;appointed of their expected Country, <HI>Virginia;</HI> without any Pro&s;|pect of human Succour, without the Help or Favour of <HI>England,</HI> with|out a Patent, without a Promi&s;e of their religious Liberties, without

convenient Shelter from the Weather, and their Hard&s;hips almo&s;t beyond the Power of Language to de&s;cribe. Clambs, Oy&s;ters, and Lob&s;ters were their daily Food; their Cloathing &s;oon became Rags and Skins of Bea&s;ts; their Pro&s;pects on the Sea were exten&s;ive, but afforded no Relief; on the Land their Views were limited to a few Rods, by a Wilderne&s;s altogether in the Dre&s;s of uncultivated Nature. Their only Neighbours, the mo&s;t &s;avage, cruel and Blood|thir&s;ty of all the human Race, over numbered them a Thou&s;and to One, and were united to de&s;troy them while few and weak. The&s;e are a Few of the numberle&s;s Sufferings which attended their fir&s;t Set|lements; &s;o that, in le&s;s than five Months after their Arrival, a|bove half the Company died; yet the Survivors bore all their Mi&s;|fortunes with a chri&s;tian Fortitude and Patience, as extraordinary as their Trials. "Brown Bread and the Go&s;pel is good Fare," they u&s;ed to &s;ay to one another, for their mutual Encouragment to Pati|ence and Endurance. Thus they were carried on, and &s;oon began to encrea&s;e in Numbers; &s;o that when the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> in <HI>No|va-Scotia,</HI> di&s;turbed them, they rai&s;ed an Army in 1690, under Sir WILLIAM PHIPPS, and took that Fort, and therewith the whole Country of <HI>Acadia,</HI> which was afterwards ceded to the <HI>French,</HI> at the Treaty of <HI>Ry&s;wick.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Year the <HI>New-Englanders</HI> rai&s;ed three Thou&s;and Men, to make an Attempt upon <HI>Canada,</HI> but failed of Succe&s;s; after having &s;u&s;tained the Lo&s;s of a Thou&s;and Lives, and the Expence of fifteen Thou&s;and Pounds.</P>
<P>About eighteen Years after they made another Attempt again&s;t <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> but had not the former Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Near the &s;ame Time, Queen ANNE &s;ignified her royal Intention to reduce <HI>Canada;</HI> and making the &s;ame known to the <HI>New-England|ers,</HI> they acceded to every Mea&s;ure with great Alacrity; but the Par|liament did not proceed on the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The next Year, <HI>New-England</HI> rai&s;ed an Army, and took <HI>Port-Roy|al,</HI> with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of only five Hundred <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops; &s;ince which Time the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Province, by the Vigilance of their late
<PB N="7" REF="013177_0006_0F929166266529A0">
Governor SHIRLEY, in &s;ending Provincial Troops to their timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance, has &s;aved that Fort two or three Times from falling into the Enemy's Hand; and it is owing to their Aid that it is now in the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> together with the whole Country of <HI>No|va-Scotia.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after, they rai&s;ed more than their Quota, in the unfortunate Expedition again&s;t <HI>Canada,</HI> under General HILL; and &s;u&s;tained a great Lo&s;s of Men, together with an heavy Expence.</P>
<P>In 1703, <HI>Jamaica</HI> being threatened with an Inva&s;ion, applied to <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> for Help; the Inhabitants of that Province rai&s;ed two Companies, and &s;ent them under the Command of Colonel WALTON and Captain LARAMORE; which timely aid arrived &s;afe to the I&s;land, but very few of them ever returned to their own Country.</P>
<P>In 17740, they rai&s;ed many Hundred Men, and made an Attempt upon the I&s;land of <HI>Cuba;</HI> but failing of Succe&s;s, mo&s;t of tho&s;e Men were unhappily buried on that I&s;land.</P>
<P>In 1745, the <HI>New-England</HI> Provinces &s;et on foot an Expedition a|gain&s;t <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> under General PEPPEREL; and rai&s;ed three Thou|&s;and five Hundred Men, who were embarked on board a &s;ufficient Number of Tran&s;ports, with Provi&s;ions, Artillery, and every Nece&s;|&s;ary for a Campaign, guarded by a Number of armed Ships. In this important Bu&s;ine&s;s they were &s;ucce&s;sful. <HI>Great-Britain</HI> knew nothing of this Attempt, neither did any other Colony afford any A&s;&s;i&s;tance; nor was there any, except from Admiral WARREN, who came from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> with four Ships of War, and joined the Fleet before <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> when the Conque&s;t was half compleated; &s;o that he did not fire a Gun at any of the &s;trong Fortre&s;&s;es of the Enemy; and the City of <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> together with the I&s;lands of <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> and <HI>St. John's</HI> &s;urrendered to the <HI>New-England</HI> Forces. And although the Land and Sea Forces went forth as equal Adventurers (according to a previous Agreement at <HI>Bo&s;ton)</HI> yet when a great Trea&s;ure, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> a <HI>French</HI> Ship from the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> two <HI>French</HI> Ships from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and &s;everal other Ships of immen&s;e Value (which put into <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="013177_0007_0F929166A2B521C0">
to recruit in their way Home) fell into our Hands by Means of this Capture; the Admiral ordered them to <HI>England</HI> for Condemnation, and the Property was all divided among the King's Ships, and not one Farthing of it was ever enjoyed by the <HI>New-England</HI> Troops; except a &s;mall Sum which Capt. FLETCHER received after near as much expended in his Application to obtain it. Thus, by Means of this Undertaking of <HI>New-England,</HI> double, if not treble the Ca&s;h was brought into <HI>England,</HI> that ever <HI>England</HI> paid for this important Piece of Service; and the Conque&s;t it&s;elf was very &s;oon after given up to the <HI>French,</HI> to buy a Peace for the <HI>Dutch. New-England</HI> was indeed paid the Expence of this Expedition by the Crown; but at &s;uch a low Rate, that many were ruined in their Fortunes. The Benefit of all the&s;e Conque&s;ts accrued to this Nation, and <HI>New-England</HI> was obliged to &s;et down where it began, with this Difference only, that they lo&s;t nine|teen Hundred of their be&s;t Men.</P>
<P>In 1746, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;et on foot an Expedition again&s;t Canada. <HI>New-England</HI> was de&s;ired to rai&s;e its Quota of Men, and a great Ex|pence was incurred for that Purpo&s;e; but We&s;terly (&s;ome &s;ay, <HI>F&mdash;h</HI>) Winds blew &s;o hard, and &s;o long, on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ports, that the Fleet de&s;tined for that Service did not get out of the Har|bours, and this Expedition came to nothing. Here it may be mentioned, that near the &s;ame Time, the Duke <HI>D'Anville, </HI> with about 20 Sail of <HI>French</HI> Ships of the Line, was &s;uffered to approach the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-England,</HI> undi&s;turbed; though he came to revenge the taking of <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> and the Reduction of <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI> by the <HI>New-Englanders.</HI> Divine Providence was plea&s;ed to interfere; the Fleet was &s;cattered, and only a few Ships returned to <HI>France,</HI> hav|ing done <HI>New-England</HI> no Damage, except putting them to a con&s;i|derable Expence in watching their Motions, and preparing to give them a proper Reception; and making Captures of a Number of the Fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>During the la&s;t War, <HI>New-England</HI> at every call, rai&s;ed its Quota of Men, and joined the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops. The Numbers rai&s;ed, and the Chearfulne&s;s with which they were rai&s;ed, will hardly find Cre|dit
<PB N="9" REF="013177_0008_0F9291678454EEB8">
in the Annals of Hi&s;tory. And although at the Beginning of the War, through a Mi&s;take in Mea&s;ures, the Nation met with great Di&s;couragement, and was almo&s;t ready to fall a Prey into the Ene|my's Hand; yet no &s;ooner was that great Mini&s;ter (yet living) ad|vanced to the Helm of national Affairs, and the be&s;t and mo&s;t faith|ful Officers appointed to command the Troops, but it &s;et <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> in Triumph. Every Mea&s;ure propo&s;ed, was adopted; and, as one In&s;tance, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Province rai&s;ed &s;even Thou&s;and Men to &s;erve in one Campaign, and paid and cloathed them; be&s;ides three Thou&s;and more which were, at the &s;ame Time, in pay on their own more immediate Service. All the&s;e together amounted to a Fourth Part, of all the Men in the whole Province, capable of bearing Arms. In this &s;pirited Manner they proceeded, until the War was fini&s;hed; which &s;wept away a large Proportion of their fighting Men, and involved the Province in a Debt, which will not be paid in fifty Years.</P>
<P>It may now be enquired, how <HI>New-England</HI> behaved under all the Sufferings and Services before-mentioned? Did they de&s;pair? No. War was almo&s;t their continual Employment, when the Mother Country was at Peace, us well as when it was at War. From their fir&s;t Arrival to the End of the la&s;t War, &s;carce a Village was &s;ettled, but what was broken up once, or oftner by the Savages. Men, Women, and Children, whole Families, Villages and Towns, were murthered, &s;calpt, and captivated, and their whole Sub&s;tance committed to the Flames. It may be &s;aid with Truth, that mo&s;t of the inland Towns were once or twice, &s;oaked with the Blood of their Inhabitants. Did they Murmur at being thus oppre&s;&s;ed, while wholly neglected by the Nation? No. Did they grow di&s;affected to the national Intere&s;t? The contrary to all this was manife&s;t. They loved and revered the Nation to a Degree of Exce&s;s and Enthu&s;ia&s;m. New Glory to the Crown, new Acqui&s;itions of Territory, Happi|ne&s;s, and Wealth to <HI>England,</HI> were ever as much a Source of Joy to <HI>New-England,</HI> as to the Nation it&s;elf: And every Misfortune that befel the Parent Country, as deeply affected the <HI>New-England</HI> Colo|nies.
<PB N="10" REF="013177_0009_0F929168211B43F8">
However &s;trange this may &s;eem, it is an undoubted Truth. If the Nation pro&s;pered, they fought with reiterated Vigour, and bore Hard&s;hips with Patience and Fortitude; nay, &s;uch was their Sincerity, and the Strength of their Affections and Regard for the Mother Country, that the News of any dark Cloud gathering over <HI>England,</HI> would mo&s;t vi&s;ibly &s;ink their Spirits and di&s;til in Tears. On &s;uch Occa&s;ions, the adver&s;e A&s;pect of Affairs was the melancholy Topic of their Con&s;ultations at the General Court; and whether any thing could be done by them to prevent the approaching Dan|ger, became the principal Object of their Attention. If you went into their Churches, they would be often found Praying, Fa&s;ting, and Weeping, that the impending Evil might be averted; and the fame was ob&s;ervable in private Families.</P>
<P>Thus they went on, from Year to Year, and from Age to Age, with an invincible Attachment to a Country, to which, be&s;ides Love, they owed nothing but a dear bought Charter, and the Birth of a few of their Fore-Fathers.</P>
<P>It may now be con&s;idered&punc; of what Advantage <HI>New-England</HI> is to the Mother Country, more e&s;pecially above the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands, con&s;idering the Charge the Nation, has been put to, to &s;ecure and defend them &s;eparately. At fir&s;t Glance, the Difference is nearly, as Something is to Nothing; at lea&s;t, till the Commencement of the la&s;t War. What numerous Fleets and Armies have, at all Times, been employed in the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands, both in Peace and War? Who can tell the Millions Sterling, tho&s;e I&s;lands have co&s;t the Nation, to &s;ecure, protect, and defend them? Even in a Time of general Peace, an Expedition mu&s;t be &s;et on foot, to &s;up|pre&s;s a few <HI>Caribbs</HI> (of late) <HI>St. Vincent's;</HI> the very Thought of which creates a Blu&s;h. <HI>New-England</HI> has, for all that Time, been <HI>intirely</HI> left to its own Fate. In common there was not &s;o much Sea Force, as would amount to an armed Long-Boat, provided at the Co&s;t of the Crown; not a &s;ingle Officer, or private Man in Pay of the Crown (till &s;ince the la&s;t Peace) though the War was ever &s;o hot, and Danger ever &s;o threatning. God alone appeared to be the
<PB N="11" REF="013177_0010_0F92916B22B79A90">
Guardian of <HI>New-England,</HI> and carried the Inhabitants through the many Difficulties which attended their Struggle, under the Au&s;pices of his gracious Providence&mdash;a Struggle, which has rai&s;ed, as it were, an Empire to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown, and a va&s;t Fund of Wealth and Glory to the Nation.&mdash;Rivers of Blood were laid in the Foundation, at the &s;ole Expence of the Inhabitants of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>Great Numbers of <HI>New-England</HI> Men are trained up to the Sea, in Fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els, and on other Voyages; &s;o that it is a good Nur|&s;ery for the Royal Navy. The Refu&s;e of their Fi&s;h, together with all Kinds of Provi&s;ions, Hor&s;es and Lumber, they carry to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> without which the <HI>I&s;landers</HI> could not make Sugar, &amp;c. &s;o cheap as they now do. And &s;hould <HI>New-England</HI> &s;top the Trade to the I&s;lands, a Plantation there would hardly be worth Acceptance, if the <HI>I&s;landers</HI> mu&s;t be &s;upplied with Provi&s;ions from <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The be&s;t Sort of Fi&s;h is &s;ent to <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and the <HI>Straits;</HI> the neat Proceeds of which are remitted to <HI>England</HI> in Ca&s;h. Oil, Bone, Ma&s;ts for the Royal Navy, Timber of all Kinds (which is now &s;ent home in Rafts) Ships of every Kind, Pot-A&s;h, Furrs, &amp;c. &amp;c. (many of which <HI>England</HI> was obliged to other Nations for, before <HI>New-England</HI> was knows) are the immediate Exports to <HI>Great-Bri|tain.</HI> In return for all, they receive the Manufactories of <HI>England,</HI> and thereby give Bread to Thou&s;ands of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects. Thus all their Labour centers in <HI>England,</HI> excepting their daily Food.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t northern Colonies (e&s;pecially <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay)</HI> while the national Debt has been contracting, have been at almo&s;t an infinite Expence of Blood and Trea&s;ure, to defend them&s;elves; and in a Number of In&s;tances, to carry their Arms into the Enemies Country, by which his Maje&s;ty's Service has been greatly promoted for a Century pa&s;t, until the Commencement of the la&s;t War. With a very little Help from <HI>Connecticut</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire</HI> Colonies only, they have been the grand Barrier of many of his Maje&s;ty's other Colonies on the Continent; at lea&s;t &s;o much, that it may be affirmed, had they not exerted them&s;elves, more than all the other Colonies together, with the Nation's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the laying Du|ties
<PB N="12" REF="013177_0011_0F92916C305667A8">
on the Colonies had been a needle&s;s Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eventy Years ago, LOUIS the 14th of <HI>France,</HI> who fir&s;t projected the Conque&s;t of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> might have accompli&s;hed his De&s;igns, if <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> had not effectually covered the whole Country. <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> (both of them Royal Governments) were by their Situa|tion &s;omewhat expo&s;ed. As to the former, their Trade and Inter|cour&s;e with the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> gave them great Advantage, in turning the Heat of the War from their own Doors, to tho&s;e of <HI>Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay.</HI> Re&s;pecting the latter, near a Fourth part of <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts</HI> Province, was added to <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and after this Addi|tion of Territory, which was &s;o much expo&s;ed to the Enemy, and which <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> was unable to defend; the Province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> at a very great Expence, defended it for them; <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> has not yet paid one Farthing of the Expence, although Application was made to <HI>England</HI> for that Purpo&s;e, and Re&s;titution was promi&s;ed, or el&s;e that the Territory &s;hould be returned; neither of which Promi&s;es hath ever been performed.</P>
<P>Let us now inquire, whether <HI>New-England</HI> hath not a ju&s;t Right to expect &s;ome peculiar Advantages, as the Fruit of their Sufferings, Services, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, have they not Rea&s;on to expect, and an unque&s;tionable Right to claim, a national Confidence in their future Attachment to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t? This is a Que&s;tion of great Importance; be|cau&s;e if they had good Rea&s;on and clear Right to expect this Opinion from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> then every oppre&s;&s;ive Mea&s;ure is unju&s;t, arbitrary and cruel. And if it be con&s;idered, how unnatural any Oppre&s;&s;ion of our fellow Subjects mu&s;t be, who have given &s;uch unparallelled Evidence, of their Adherence to the national Good; and how likely to introduce Di&s;traction, and beget Di&s;tru&s;t and Di&s;affection, &s;urely, common Prudence will direct a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter to avoid or Repeal &s;uch impolitic Ruinous, and oppre&s;&s;ive Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Again, have they not both Rea&s;on and Right to expect &s;ome <HI>pecu|liar</HI> Advantages, particularly &s;uch, as were not balanced, much le&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="013177_0012_0F92916CA4908CC8">
over-balanced, by any pecuniary Advantages? Doth not the Lo&s;s of fourteen or fifteen Thou&s;and Men (which they &s;u&s;tained during the la&s;t War) be&s;ides a very heavy Debt yet remaining, after twelve Years Taxes, to the Amount of at lea&s;t four Shillings in the Pound, de&s;erve &s;ome Compen&s;ation, at lea&s;t &s;uch as will place them on an equitable Adju&s;tment with the other <HI>American</HI> Provinces.</P>
<P>Again, have they not good Rea&s;on to expect, as all their Labour centers in <HI>England,</HI> that it &s;hould excu&s;e them from being taxed, to pay the national Debt? e&s;pecially while they Support a Government of their own. And that all Taxes &s;hould be laid con&s;i&s;tently with <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberty, and be void of all Partiality, no ju&s;t Man can po&s;&s;i|bly deny. Ought not the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation to re&s;t &s;atisfied, and con|tent, with the &s;ame Kind of Services from them, as from his Maje&s;|ty's other Subjects? This is certain, they have done as much for the national Glory, and have exulted in it. Why then, &s;hould they not &s;hare in the &s;ame Immunities? At lea&s;t be exempted from the &s;ame Oppre&s;&s;ions? And why &s;ubmit to Taxes, unle&s;s by their own Re|pre&s;entatives?</P>
<P>Let us now inquire, into the Nece&s;&s;ity of taking or impo&s;ing Du|ties, on the Colonies; or whether there was any Authority for &s;uch a Step, while their Charters continued in Force? The Que&s;tion &s;hall not be, about the Nece&s;&s;ity the Nation was under, of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Colonies. No doubt, it &s;tands in need of Help from them; but &s;uch Help &s;hould be in Proportion to the Ability of the re&s;pective Colonies, and to the Expences the Nation hath been put to, in pro|tecting, &s;ecuring, and defending them &s;everally. But the true Inquiry &s;eems to be, what was the Nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing this Money by Autho|rity of Parliament.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that this Mea&s;ure, &s;o extremely alarming, to the Colonies, was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to obtain their Help, is very &s;trange. The Rea|&s;on is, that the Colonies were never a&s;ked, if they would rai&s;e a Sum them&s;elves, on a Requi&s;ition from <HI>England.</HI> This Method was taken in Time of War, in rai&s;ing Men; and when it is con&s;idered,
<PB N="14" REF="013177_0013_0F92916D794C8C70">
how cheerfully they complied with every Reque&s;t, although heavy, and burthen&s;ome to the la&s;t Degree, and, with what an entire Confidence in his Maje&s;ty's Wi&s;dom, this was done; it mu&s;t needs creat &s;ome Wonder, that this Method for rai&s;ing Money, to di&s;|charge the national Debt, never was propo&s;ed to them. There was the greate&s;t Probability from long Experience, as well as from the good Di&s;po&s;ition the Colonies then manife&s;ted, that it would have been complied with, and the Money paid into the Exchequer, with|out Half the Di&s;tre&s;s on the People; and with Three Parts in Four of more clear Revenue to the Crown, than by the pre&s;ent Duty, or Tax in the Way &s;ince adopted. There would have been no In|fringement on Charter Rights, no Di&s;affection from the Parent Country; and no Regret, that they had fought and bled for Chains, would have been heard among the Inhabitants. Suppo&s;ing this Method had failed, the Steps which have been taken, might have had &s;ome &s;eeming Appearance of Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>It may now be enquired, whether the Crown has received any Benefit from the&s;e Duties or not?</P>
<P>Here then let it be con&s;idered, what va&s;t Sums of Money are fir&s;t paid to the Officers, and others who receive their Saleries out of this Revenue (and the unlimited Power the Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners have, of increa&s;ing the Number of Officers under them) which are &s;o many, that there were but about Eighty-five Pounds paid into the Exchequer, the la&s;t Year. Farther what Numbers of Men of War, and Swarms of armed Ve&s;&s;els, and armed Boats, and how many Regiments of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Troops are al&s;o emyloyed, under Pre|tence of of protecting the Officers of this Revenue, who&s;e Pay comes from another Quarter? This mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily leave a large Ballance again&s;t the Nation.</P>
<P>Did not the People of <HI>New-England</HI> undergo &s;uch Hard&s;hips and Sufferings as have been &s;tated, in the fir&s;t Settlement of the Country? Did they not make a Conque&s;t of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> once and again? Did they not always exert them&s;elves for the national Intere&s;t, by com|plying with every Requi&s;ition for that Purpo&s;e? Have they not behaved them&s;elves dutifully, and ever loyally to the Crown of <HI>Eng|land?</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="013177_0014_0F92916F839A8FC8">
And have their Services and Sufferings been attended with the Expence of &s;o much Blood and Trea&s;ure, that they have even rai&s;ed an Empire to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and are they al|lowed to have and maintain a Government of them&s;elves, by a Charter under the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and all this at the &s;ole Ex|pence of the Inhabitants? If &s;o, then every Mea&s;ure already taken, or which may be about to be taken by the Parent Country, that is grievous to them, is but an unkind Return; it is not treating them as every Father is wont to treat his Children, and if &s;uch Treatment &s;hould be continued, it will, perhaps, end in the utter Ruin of the whole Family.</P>
<P>If the foregoing Repre&s;entation of <HI>New-England</HI> be true, (as all unprejudiced Men, who have Knowledge of the Hi&s;tory, will wit|ne&s;s,) the following Remarks may be made.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Can it be for the Intere&s;t of the Nation, to continue the Duties on the Colonies, when the Expence of collecting them, is double, if not treble, the Amount of the whole Duties collected?</P>
<P>Secondly. Can it be for the Inetre&s;t of the Nation, to lo&s;e the Affections of four or five Millions of brave, loyal and loving Sub|jects, always inured to manly Freedom, who have never thought it too much to venture their Lives and Fortunes, and every Thing dear and valuable to them, if by any Means they could add to the Glory, Wealth and Oppulence of the Nation? This they have done, at all Times, where there was the lea&s;t Probability of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Finally, Can it be for the Intere&s;t of the Nation, to keep up an armed Force in <HI>New-England,</HI> e&s;pecially in Time of Peace? How vauge is the Pretence, for thus affronting, and even murthering &s;ome of the Inhabitants, corrupting their Morals by Debauchery, Drunkenne&s;s, Prophanene&s;s, &amp;c.! Sins but little known among them, until Troops were quartered upon them. Surely &s;uch a Torrent of Evils, as has ru&s;hed in upon them by Means of the Mea&s;ures taken by the Mother Country, is a far greater Puni&s;hment, than all the Hard&s;hips and Difficulties they endured, from their fir&s;t Settle|ment, to the End of the la&s;t War. In all tho&s;e Hard&s;hips and Sufferings, there was no general Complaint or Murmurings. But
<PB N="16" REF="013177_0015_0F92916FC2059FB8">
how far this is from being the Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, is manife&s;t to the World; and there is no Doubt, but they would rather have conti|nued, to have fought <HI>Canada</HI> to the Knees in Blood, with their Charter Rights in full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, than to be freed even from &s;o dreadful a Calamity, and have the Evils before-mentioned heaped upon them. Let me add, that all Men of Sobriety, who have the national Intere&s;t at Heart, tremble to think, what the End of the&s;e Proceedings will be.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, notwith&s;tanding the hard Treatment the Col|onies have met with of late Years, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> In having Duties or Taxes impo&s;ed upon them, by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, quartering Troops in the capital Town, wre&s;ting <HI>Ca&s;tle-William</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>A Fortre&s;s built on an I&s;land, three Miles from Bo&s;ton, commanding all Ships that enter the Harbour; it has upwards of</HI> 100 <HI>large Cannon, a Number of Mortars, and every Nece&s;&s;ary &s;uitable for a Fortification.</HI></NOTE> out of the Hands of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> which built, furni&s;hed and maintained it, at their &s;ole Expence; without either paying the Province for the Fort and its Artillery, or &s;o much as promi&s;ing that the Crown of <HI>England</HI> would pay for it; be&s;ides the numerous other dreadful Evils which have attended the&s;e Mea&s;ures.&mdash;Nothwith&s;tanding the&s;e Things the Colonies do not wholly de&s;pair, but continue to be loyal and loving Subjects to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, hoping that the Influence of Individuals will be of &s;hort Continuance. They never have doubted, that if the Nation &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately once attend to the Services which the Colonies have done it, of what Importance they mu&s;t ever be to its Intere&s;ts, and that all their pa&s;t Services have been effected in the Enjoyment of their civil and religions Rights and Pri|vileges, the Nation would grant them the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof for the Time to come. In this Hope, under God, they have hitherto per&s;e|vered; nay, &s;o well grounded do they &s;uppo&s;e this Hope to be, that however &s;trange it may &s;eem, though the Mea&s;ures which have &s;o much aggrieved them, were adopted by the repre&s;entative Body of the Empire, they do not yet give it up; although it is like hoping again&s;t Hope.</P>
