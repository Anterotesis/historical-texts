<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS waits upon you with my thanks for &s;ending me the Lord Bi&s;hop of Landaff's &s;ermon, preached la&s;t February before the Society for the propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign parts; though I am &s;orry it was accom|panied with your de&s;ire, after I had carefully read it, to give you my thoughts concerning tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages in it which relate to the American Colonies. You could not have &s;elected a per&s;on better fit|ted to an&s;wer your de&s;ign, &s;o far as a warm affection for this as well as the Mother-Country, and a &s;trong attachment to the intere&s;t and honor of both, may be e&s;teemed requi&s;ite qualifications; but you might, in regard of lei&s;ure and abilities, with much more propriety, have enjoined this &s;ervice on &s;ome others of your acquaintance: However, my obligations to you are &s;uch, that I could not excu&s;e my &s;elf from attempting that, which, I join with you in thinking, ju&s;tice to the Colonies requires &s;hould be done upon this oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010579_0004_0F80D0A7B51182A0">Had the character you mention, as given the Briti&s;h Colonies, been contained in a di&s;cour&s;e delivered by a common Clergy-man, before a common audience, it would, I believe, have given you no unea&s;ine&s;s; as you would not have been apprehen&s;ive of any harm from it: But, as it is exhibited in a &s;ermon, preached before the incor|porated Society for the propagation of the Go&s;pel in foreign parts, many of whom are high in rank, and &s;u&s;tain the greate&s;t character, no wonder your concern was moved; e&s;pecially, as this re&s;pectable body of men have virtually made them&s;elves patrons of the &s;ermon. So we are authori&s;ed to think from their voting the preacher thanks for it, and de&s;iring him to deliver to them a copy of it for the pre&s;s; unle&s;s it may be &s;aid, this was only a matter of form and ceremony; to &s;uppo&s;e which would reflect di&s;honor on its dignified author. We, in this part of the world, mu&s;t be &s;hamefully impious and immoral, to de&s;erve what is here &s;aid of us; or, if we do not, very unhappy to be publickly placed in &s;o injurious a point of light. Whether we are the one, or the other, I &s;hall now examine.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip &s;ays, Pag. 6. "Since the di&s;|covery of the new world, the &s;ame provi&s;ion hath not been made of mini&s;ters, nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of Chri&s;tianity among tho&s;e who removed thither; e&s;pecially in the Briti&s;h Colonies". If
<PB N="7" REF="010579_0005_0F80D0A7E24B53D0">
the complaint here made, &s;o far as the Colonies without di&s;crimination are concerned in it, lies in this, that they have not provided them&s;elves with mini&s;ters <HI>epi&s;copally ordained,</HI> they readily own the fact. But, &s;urely, his Lord&s;hip does not think, that &s;uch mini&s;ters are <HI>&s;o nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that Chri&s;tianity cannot be &s;upported without them. This doctrine was taught, and believed, in former times, when bigotry and oppre&s;&s;ion were the characteri&s;tic of &s;ome that were placed in high offices both in church and &s;tate; but, in the pre&s;ent day of enlarged knowledge and free|dom of inquiry, it is hoped there is no Arch-Bi&s;hop, or Bi&s;hop in England, of &s;uch contracted principles. Certainly, his Lord&s;hip is more ca|tholic in his &s;entiments: Otherwi&s;e He might have been more exten&s;ive in his complaint, by tak|ing in Scotland, Holland, and many of the reform|ed prote&s;tant churches in Europe; for they, as truly as the Briti&s;h Colonies in America, are not provided with mini&s;ters "nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of Chri&s;tianity" among them, if Epi&s;copal ones only are &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. It is therefore probable, the meaning of the charge again&s;t the Colonies is, that they had provided them&s;elves with no mini&s;ters at all, or had been &s;o &s;canty in their provi&s;ion, that Chri&s;tianity, on this ac|count, mu&s;t &s;ink and die, having no better a &s;up|port. But this, affirmed of the Colonies with|out di&s;tinction, or limitation, is &s;o contrary to the
<PB N="8" REF="010579_0006_0F80D0A8A060AE58">
truth of fact, and might have &s;o ea&s;ily been known to be &s;o, that I cannot but wonder at his Lord&s;hip's charge. It can, with honor to him, be in no way accounted for but by &s;uppo&s;ing, that he was &s;ome how or other &s;trangely mi&s;in|formed. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, we in New-England, now have, and all along from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Country have had, a full provi&s;ion of Go&s;pel-mini&s;ters. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Within the limits of New-England, there are now, at the lowe&s;t computation, not le&s;s than five hundred and fifty mini&s;ters, &s;ome Pre&s;byterian, mo&s;tly Congregational, who have been regularly &s;eparated to the pa&s;toral charge of as many chri|&s;tian &s;ocieties; having been fir&s;t educated, and graduated, at one or other of our colleges. They may be ju&s;tly farther characteri&s;ed as men of a good moral conver&s;ation. For &s;o &s;acred a regard is paid here to the apo&s;tle Paul's directions to Timothy and Tius, that a mini&s;ter is &s;urely di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office, if it appears, that he is not "blame|le&s;s as a &s;teward of God, &s;ober, holy, ju&s;t and tem|perate in all things." It has been &s;aid by &s;trangers who have come among us, and by &s;ome Church-Clergymen too, that the work of the mini&s;try is not more faithfully and diligently performed in any part of the chri&s;tian world.</NOTE> Had they been con&s;ecrated after the mode of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church at home, and his Lord&s;hip had known their num|ber and ju&s;t character, he would, I doubt not, have rever&s;ed what he has here laid, and have &s;poken largely in commendation of, at lea&s;t, the&s;e parts of the American world.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010579_0007_0F80D0A96C0A8940">The &s;ermon goes on, pag. ibid. "A &s;canda|lous neglect, (this of not making a provi&s;ion of mini&s;ters) which hath brought great and de&s;erv|ed reproach both on the adventurers, and on the goverment whence they went; and under who&s;e protection and power they &s;till remained in their new habitations". How far the government at home have brought upon them&s;elves "de&s;erved reproach" for this "&s;candalous neglect", I pre|&s;ume not to &s;ay; but this I will venture to &s;ay, that they were as deficient in "protecting" the adventurers, as in "providing mini&s;ters" for them. It is well known here, if not in England, that it was from them&s;elves, without any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from the government whence they came, that they founded and &s;ettled this new world, amid&s;t a thou&s;and hard&s;hips, and in oppo&s;ition to the furious malice of the Indian &s;avages, with whom they were at war, at one time and ano|ther, at a va&s;t expence of blood and trea&s;ure, as long as they lived; and their po&s;terity after them were many years expo&s;ed to like difficulties and dangers, and went chearfully through them without help afforded to them from the native home of their fathers.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip proceeds, pag. ibid.
<Q>To the adventurers, what reproach could be ca&s;t, hea|vier than they de&s;erved? Who, with their native &s;oil, abandoned their native manners and
<PB N="10" REF="010579_0008_0F80D0AA27007B58">
religion; and e'er long were found in many parts living without remembrance or knowledge of God, without any Divine wor&s;hip, in di&s;&s;olute wickedne&s;s, and the mo&s;t brutal profligacy of manners. In&s;tead of civili&s;ing and converting barbarous infidels, as they undertook to do, they became them&s;elves infidels and barbari|ans. And is it not &s;ome aggravation of their &s;hame, that this their neglect of religion was contrary to the pretences and conditions under which they obtained Royal grants, and public authority to their adventures? The pretences and conditions were, that their de&s;ign was, and that they &s;hould endeavour, the enlargement of Commerce, and the propagation of chri&s;ti|an faith. The former they executed with &s;incerity and zeal; and in the latter mo&s;t no|toriou&s;ly failed.</Q>
A &s;tranger to the hi&s;tory of the&s;e adventurers would be obviou&s;ly and unavoidably led, from the de&s;cription in this paragraph, to conceive of them, "in many parts" at lea&s;t, as impious, profligate and di&s;&s;o|lutely wicked to the highe&s;t degree of guilt. A blacker character could not have been given of them.</P>
<P>But, in "what parts" were the adventurers thus lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of God and religion? His Lord&s;hip has not told us in direct terms; but he has &s;o clearly and fully pointed out the ad|venturers
<PB N="11" REF="010579_0009_0F80D0AB806A2F98">
he had in view, by certain de&s;criptive marks, that we can be at no lo&s;s to know his meaning in the limiting words, "many parts" Such are the&s;e that follow, "their not civili&s;ing and converting the barbarous infidels, as they UNDERTOOK TO DO"; their neglect of this in|&s;tance of religion "in contrariety to the PRETEN|CES and CONDITIONS under which they obtained ROYAL GRANTS"; and, finally, tho&s;e pretences and conditions declaring, that "their DESIGN WAS, and that THEY WOULD ENDEAVOUR, THE PROPAGATION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH". There were no adventurers to Ame|rica, who undertook to convert the native-barba|rians, and to whom Royal grants were made upon this condition, unle&s;s it were tho&s;e who came into New-England. The&s;e therefore mu&s;t be the adventurers his Lord&s;hip had more e&s;pe|cially in his eye.</P>
<P>And of the&s;e he declares, "that, with their na|tive &s;oil, they abandoned their native manners and religion". His Lord&s;hip could not affirm this from per&s;onal knowledge, as the&s;e adventurers were all dead long before he came into being. And it is difficult to &s;ay whence he could collect &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing an account. It is not contained in any hi&s;tory that was ever wrote, either of them, or of the &s;ettlement of the Country by them. No Mi&s;&s;ionary from the Society, it is candidly believed, could be &s;o ba&s;ely wicked, as
<PB N="12" REF="010579_0010_0F80D0ABE5017ED8">
to tran&s;mit it home, it is &s;o &s;landerous and fal&s;e: Nor can it ea&s;ily be conceived how his Lord|&s;hip could come by it, unle&s;s from &s;ome one, or more, who, being di&s;affected to the Colonies, and maliciou&s;ly &s;et again&s;t them, took an un|bounded liberty in &s;peaking evil of them, even from their fir&s;t beginnings. The&s;e adventurers have &s;ometimes been blamed for having too much religion; but never before, within my knowledge, for having none, or for having lo&s;t what they had in their "native" land.</P>
<P>It is acknowledged, if their "native religion" lay in a blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Church-power, arbitrarily exerci&s;ed, they did "abandon" it; and their virtue hereby di&s;covered will be &s;poken of to their honor, throughout all generations, by tho&s;e acquainted with it, who really believe, in its ju&s;t latitude, this undoubted Go&s;pel-truth, namely, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t only is &s;upreme Head and Lord of the chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>But if by "abandoning their native religion" is meant, their renouncing the doctrines of Chri|&s;tianity as held forth in the thirty nine articles of the Church of England, the rever&s;e of what is here &s;aid is the truth. The&s;e indeed are the doctrines that were handed down from them to their children and children's children; in&s;omuch that they are to this day the &s;tandard of ortho|doxy; and there are comparatively few but are
<PB N="13" REF="010579_0011_0F80D0AC79E7E5F8">
orthodox in this &s;en&s;e, unle&s;s among tho&s;e who profe&s;s them&s;elves members of the Epi&s;copal Churches. Or if by "abandoning their native religion" the thing intended is, "that e'er long they were found without remembrance, or know|ledge of God, or any divine wor&s;hip", as the charge again&s;t them goes on in the next words; it mu&s;t be plainly &s;aid, it is altogether ground|le&s;s. There is no fact relative to the Country more certain, than that the&s;e adventurers &s;o far "remembred and knew God", as to make it one of their fir&s;t cares to provide for the carrying on, maintaining and upholding the wor&s;hip of him, which they did wherever they extended their &s;ettlements; and their po&s;terity have con&s;tantly took the like care all along to the pre&s;ent day. There is therefore no &s;en&s;e in which the above repre&s;entation can comport with truth but this, that God cannot be wor&s;hipped, at lea&s;t &s;o as that it may be proper to &s;ay he is, unle&s;s the wor&s;hip be carried on according to the manner of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Engli&s;h Church. Some of the Society's Mi&s;&s;ionaries, I have rea&s;on to believe, are much inclined to think thus; but I would not &s;upect &s;uch a thing of his Lord&s;hip. What he has here &s;aid I would rather attribute to mi&s;information.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be allowed, that the&s;e adventurers had "native manners"; otherwi&s;e they could not, upon leaving their "native &s;oil, "abandon
<PB N="14" REF="010579_0012_0F80D0AD1FBDFDE8">
them". But, they mu&s;t have abandoned them to an enormous height of guilt, to ju&s;tifie their being charged "with di&s;&s;olute wickedne&s;s, and the mo&s;t brutal profligacy of manners". The&s;e words are &s;o gro&s;ly reproachful, that I could &s;carce believe my own eyes, when I &s;aw them in his Lord&s;hip's &s;ermon. He mu&s;t certainly, however in&s;en&s;ible of it, have corre&s;ponded, by word, or writing, with &s;ome vile Calumniator.</P>
<P>It would be inju&s;tice to the fir&s;t fathers of New-England, if I did not &s;ay upon this occa&s;ion, that &s;ome of them were exceeded by few, in point of natural, or acquired accompli&s;hments; and by far the greater part of them were emi|nently holy men; pious toward God, jealous of the honor of Chri&s;t as &s;ole head of the Church, &s;ober, ju&s;t, kind, meek, patient, di&s;engaged in their affection to things on the earth, and intirely re&s;igned to the alwi&s;e righteous Governor of the univer&s;e. And of this they exhibited the &s;trong|e&s;t evidence by their truly chri&s;tian deportment under far greater tryals than good men are ordi|narily called to. They for&s;ook every thing near and dear to them in their native land, from a regard to him who is "King in Sion". And when they removed to the then American wilds, and found them&s;elves &s;eparated from their friends by a wide Ocean, without the conveniences, and often in want even of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, &s;ur|rounded with difficulties, and expo&s;ed to all
<PB N="15" REF="010579_0013_0F80D0B084160158">
manner of hard&s;hips and dangers, what could tempt them to continue here, if they had been tho&s;e "infidels, barbarians, di&s;&s;olutely wicked and brutal profligates", they are repre&s;ented by his Lord&s;hip to have been? What, in this ca&s;e, could have prevented their return to their friends, and the comforts of their native home? As they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have lo&s;t all con&s;cience towards God, if they ever had any, Church impo&s;itions could have been no ob&s;tacle in their way. They might, in &s;hort, with infi|nitely more rea&s;on, have been &s;poken of as fools, or mad-men, than irreligious profligates. It may, I believe, be &s;aid with &s;trict truth, there are none, now in England, of any deno|mination, in high or low office, or none at all, who are under circum&s;tances that put it in their power to give &s;uch indubitable proof of their being truly upright good men. And I wi&s;h they may never &s;ee the time when they will have opportunity, by &s;imilar tryals, to give as good evidence of their integrity. The Mi&s;&s;ionaries from the Society at home may be e&s;teemed there men of uncommon attainments in Chri&s;tian piety, di&s;covered in their zeal to pro|mote the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t; but they never yet exhibited, and, in all probability, will never be able to exhibit, like ample proof that this is their real character. No Mi&s;&s;ionary was ever &s;ent hither, till the Country, through a va&s;t extent, was &s;ubdued, cultivated and &s;ettled, &s;o
<PB N="16" REF="010579_0014_0F80D0B1183710F0">
as to render living here comfortable and plea|&s;ant. And as they are mo&s;tly fixed in popu|lous towns, in which they may ea&s;ily be fur|ni&s;hed with conveniences, and are expo&s;ed to no hard&s;hips or hazards but what are common to mankind in general; they can have oppor|tunity to give no other than common evidence of the goodne&s;s of their character; and while they give this, we will own our&s;elves &s;atisfied with it, though others &s;hould not be &s;atisfied with that which is much &s;tronger, in regard of much more important men.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add here, The adventurers to this then inho&s;pitable land, mu&s;t have the honor of being owned the original &s;ettlers of a Country, which, in time, if not prevented by oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, will probably enlarge the Briti&s;h Empire in extent, grandeur, riches and power, far beyond what has ever yet been known in the world. It is pity, after &s;uch a long cour&s;e of labors, hard&s;hips, dangers and &s;ufferings, as they heroicly went through, to prepare the way to what the Country now is, and may be in after times; I &s;ay, it is pity their a&s;hes &s;hould be raked into, and their memory treated with reproach, greater than which was never de&s;erved by any of the &s;ons of Adam, in any part of the earth. They are gone to receive the reward of their fidelity to their Savior and Lord; and their reward, it
<PB N="17" REF="010579_0015_0F80D0B1CDA61078">
may be, will be inhanced by means of the un|de&s;erved obloquies that have been ca&s;t upon them in this &s;ermon.</P>
<P>As to the charge, in the next words that, "in&s;tead of civili&s;ing and converting barba|rous infidels, as they undertook to do, they became them&s;elves infidels and barbarians"; and that it was "&s;ome aggravation of their &s;hame, that this their neglect of religion was contrary to the pretences and conditions, under which they obtained Royal grants, and public authority to their adventures": As to this charge, I &s;ay, it would, I believe, if fa&s;tened upon any other body of men, profe&s;&s;ing godli|ne&s;s, be e&s;teemed highly unchri&s;tian. Had a hint only of this nature been &s;ugge&s;ted, rela|tive to the Society in who&s;e audience this cen&s;ure was delivered, this, and much wor&s;e, would have been &s;aid of it, and de&s;ervedly too. And yet, that Society have, without all doubt, been as deficient in their endeavours to pro|pagate the Go&s;pel in the&s;e "foreign parts", where it was mo&s;t needed, and in contrariety to the de&s;ign of their incorporation too, as was ever true of the&s;e adventurers. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>What has been done by the&s;e adventurers may be &s;een in the general account that is given of their labors in &s;ome following notes. And if the facts there related &s;hould be &s;et in contra&s;t with the ab&s;tracts of the Society, relative to the Indians, it will appear at once, that, from the time of their incorporation to this day, they have done little, very little, in compari&s;on therewith. Their prin|cipal care has been to propagate the church of England; and this, not &s;o much in tho&s;e places, where there was real need of Mi&s;&s;ionaries for the in&s;truction of people in the knowledge of Chri&s;t, or to &s;et up the wor&s;hip of God among them, as where there was a fullne&s;s of means for &s;uch in|&s;truction, and divine wor&s;hip was already &s;et up, and as generally and devoutly attended as in Eng|land it &s;elf. Many thou&s;ands of pounds &s;terling have been thus expended, where there was no want of it for the propagation of the Go&s;pel, unle&s;s that means the propagation of the Epi&s;copal mode of &s;erving God. And what has been the effect of this va&s;t expence? If we look over the Society's ab&s;tracts, we &s;hall find one account from their Mi&s;&s;ionaries is, "We have bapti&s;ed &s;o many with|in &s;uch a time; &s;o many adult, and &s;o many chil|dren, white or black": Every one of which might as well have been bapti&s;ed without a &s;hilling of this expence, if it might have been done by mini|&s;ters not <HI>epi&s;copally</HI> qualified for this work. Another account amounts to this, "There is the pro&s;pect of a Church in this and the other place; we have been invited to preach here and there; &s;o many have profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves members of the Church, and more are inclined this way". But of whom are the&s;e declarations made? Not of tho&s;e, who were brought up in ignorance of the chri&s;tian religion; not of tho&s;e, who were de&s;titute of the means of &s;alvation; not of tho&s;e, who had not the opportu|nity, and did not in fact make u&s;e of it, to attend the public wor&s;hip of God: No; but of per&s;ons that have only changed, or were inclinable to change, one mode of religiou&s;ly &s;erving God for another; and too often, there is rea&s;on to think, without having thorowly inquired into matters of this nature. Sometimes an account is given of the "good morals of the people of their charge". It might, I believe, with exact ju&s;tice, be &s;aid, the&s;e were as good before, as &s;ince, their going to Church. The plain truth is, had one half the money been &s;pared, for other u&s;es, that has been expended upon New-England, tho&s;e places on the American Continent which need it much more, might have been better provided with the means of &s;alvation: Without all controver&s;ie, the <HI>poor Indians</HI> might have had more laborers &s;ent to them, both in the capacity of mini&s;ters and &s;chool-ma&s;ters; and, it is probable, a large harve&s;t of &s;ouls would, by this time, have been gathered in for Chri&s;t from among them. It is generally thought here, if a le&s;s proportion of this money was employed for the &s;upport of a party, and a far greater for carrying the Go&s;pel to the numerous aboriginal natives, who are totally ignorant of the true God, and of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it would be as honorary to the Society, and as "acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Savior, who will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth".</P>
<P>I &s;hall not think it un&s;ea&s;onable, or improper, to &s;ubjoin here, We are e&s;pecially grieved that the Society at home are not more zealous in their en|deavours to propagate the Go&s;pel among the <HI>Indian natives,</HI> as an effectual bar, a few years &s;ince, was laid in the way of our exerting our&s;elves to this purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t by the in&s;trumentality of a <HI>Corpo|ration</HI> among our &s;elves. The &s;tory is briefly this. Upon the conclu&s;ion of the late war, a general &s;pirit was rai&s;ed in the people here to endeavour the enlargement of the Redeemer's kingdom, by &s;end|ing the Go&s;pel to the Tribes of Indians on our we&s;tern borders. They were de&s;irous this affair &s;hould be put under the management of &s;ome a|mong our &s;elves of well-e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation for wi&s;dom, judgment and piety, and that they &s;hould be <HI>incorporated</HI> by an act of the Government to this end. Two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling were, in a few days, &s;ub&s;cribed, in Bo&s;ton only, upon this condition. An incorporating act was accordingly prepared, and pa&s;&s;ed by the whole Legi&s;lature of this Province, and &s;ent home for his Maje&s;ty's ap|probation, without which it could not continue in force. But it &s;oon met with a negative, by means whereof this whole money was lo&s;t, and as much more we had good rea&s;on to expect would have been &s;ub&s;cribed, be&s;ides the income of many hun|dred pounds &s;terling that had been devoted to the &s;ervice of the Indians. It is hoped, the accounts we have had are not true, that the negative upon this act was principally owing to the influence of &s;ome of the mo&s;t important members of the Society for the propagation of the Go&s;pel. We are con|tent not to have the honor of employing our own money in endeavours to Go&s;peli&s;e the&s;e Indians, if the Society will heartily and thorowly engage in it. We &s;hall rejoice to find, by their ab&s;tracts, that needful Mi&s;&s;ionaries are &s;ent to them; and far from throwing any ob&s;tacles in their way, we will do all in our power to encourage and help them.</P></NOTE> For, by far

<P>Our complaint is, that the charge here brought again&s;t the&s;e adventurers has really no foundation for its &s;upport.

And it is really unkind, I may rather &s;ay cruelly hard, to repre&s;ent them to the world, as "becoming them&s;elves infidels and barbarians", in&s;tead of u&s;ing their endeavours to "convert babarous infidels". It is not ea&s;ily conceivable, wherein they could have exerted them&s;elves with more zeal, or in more prudent ways, in endeavouring to enlarge the borders of Chri&s;t's kingdom in the&s;e "uttermo&s;t parts of the earth", by mak|ing the native barbarians the members of it. It was out of their power to &s;upport Mi&s;&s;ion|aries among the&s;e heathen; but, in other ways, they laid them&s;elves out, to the utmo&s;t of their power, as they had opportunity, for their in&s;truction in the "knowledge of God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom to know is life eternal". And by their labors, e&s;pecially as encouraged and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the London-Society, and more privately, they &s;o far effected the conver&s;ion

number of churches, under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, were gathered, con&s;i&s;ting of INDIAN members, many of whom gave proof of the reality of their conver&s;ion, by their walking in the faith and order of the Go&s;pel, &s;o as to a|dorn the doctrine of him, whom they now called their only Savior and Lord.

<P>His Lord&s;hip proceeds,
<Q>the pretences and conditions were, that their de&s;ign was, and that they &s;hould endeavour, the enlarge|ment of commerce, and the propagation of chri&s;tian faith. The former they executed with &s;incerity and zeal; in the latter mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly failed.</Q>
He then adds in the immediately following paragraph,
<Q>Their failure herein might well have been expect|ed. Religion and traffic, their two profe&s;&s;ed objects, are but ill yoke-fellows, being apt to draw quite different ways: And men who with de&s;perate hardine&s;s invade unknown

Some of the adventurers to this part of the world might have the affair of commerce principally in their view; but, notwith&s;tanding their "&s;incerity and zeal", they &s;oon found their mi&s;take in woful di&s;appointment, and mo&s;tly returned home. The &s;ettlers of this part of America were men of another turn. <HI>Liberty to wor&s;hip God agreably to the dictates of con&s;cience</HI> was the <HI>grand motive</HI> to their removal hither; and the <HI>enjoyment of this liberty</HI> at &s;o great a di&s;tance from <HI>oppre&s;&s;ive power</HI> was their &s;upport under heavier tryals than can ea&s;ily be conceived of by tho&s;e who have never been in a wilderne&s;s-country. It might therefore be well expected of &s;uch men, if of any in the world, that they &s;hould not be guilty of "notorious failures"; as it is certain they were not. It is acknow|ledged, if "religion and traffic" had been their "two profe&s;&s;ed objects", they would have been "but ill yoke-fellows", for the rea&s;ons his Lord&s;hip a&s;&s;igns.

Good may be, has been, and, I tru&s;t, is now done by tho&s;e, in who&s;e view there was a re|gard to the honors and riches of this world, as well as the promotion of Chri&s;tianity; and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of others, in who&s;e de&s;ign the objects united were religion and traffic. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An illu&s;trious in&s;tance we have of this in Mr. Thomas Mayhew, the fir&s;t of this name in Ame|rica. He came over as a merchant to the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, in the early times of that plantation, and, meeting with di&s;appointments in his bu&s;ine&s;s, he procured, in 1641, a Grant or Patent of Sir Fer|dinando Gorges, the Earl of Sterling's agent, for Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, &amp; Eli&s;abeth I&s;les, to make an Engli&s;h &s;ettlement. He was Governor as well as Patentee of the&s;e I&s;lands. This led him, tho' now about 55 years of age, to learn &s;o much of the language of the natives as was needful to under|&s;tand and di&s;cour&s;e with them. And as he grew in this acquirement, he was greatly helpful to his &s;on Thomas, now a preacher to them, in the pious work of making them Chri&s;tians. Upon the lo&s;s of this his excellent and only &s;on in 1657, though now in the 70th year of his age, an holy zeal for the glory of God, and a mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate charity for the &s;ouls of the peri&s;hing Indians, kindle up in his brea&s;t. They rai&s;e him above all tho&s;e ceremonies, forms and di&s;tinctions that lay in the way, and which he accounted as nothing in competition with their eternal &s;alvation; and he thereupon re&s;olves, having no pro&s;pect of a regular mini&s;ter, to do his utmo&s;t to carry on the good work that had been begun among them, notwith&s;tanding all external difficulties and di&s;couragements. He frequently vi&s;ited, conver&s;ed with, and in&s;tructed this poor people. He went once a week to &s;ome of their plantations. At &s;o advanced an age, he &s;et him|&s;elf with unwearied diligence to perfect him&s;elf in their difficult language; and, tho' a Governor, yet was not a&s;hamed to become a preacher among them. He ordinarily preached to &s;ome of their a&s;&s;emblies one day every week as long as he lived. And his heart was &s;o exceedingly engaged in the &s;ervice, that he &s;pared no pains, nor fatigues at &s;o great an age therein; &s;ometimes travelling on foot nigh twenty miles through the woods to preach and vi&s;it, where there was no Engli&s;h hou&s;e near to lodge at in his ab&s;ence from home. In a few years time, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e religious <HI>Indians</HI> who taught on the Lord'-day, he per&s;uaded the natives on the we&s;t-end of the I&s;land to re|ceive the Go&s;pel, who had many years been ob&s;ti|nately re&s;olved again&s;t it; &s;o that now the Indians on the I&s;les of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket might ju&s;tly bear the name of Chri&s;tian. The number of their adult, on both the&s;e I&s;lands, was then about three thou&s;and. He went on labori|ou&s;ly in this noble work of promoting the &s;alvation of the &s;ouls of the&s;e Indians to the 93d year of his age, when he died to the great lamentation both of the Engli&s;h and Indians.&mdash;When the incorporated Society at home &s;hall &s;ee fit, in their pious zeal for the propagation of the Go&s;pel, to employ Mi&s;&s;ion|aries, as they might ea&s;ily do, among the <HI>Indian heathen</HI> &s;ettled all over this Continent, who &s;hall exert them&s;elves with like re&s;olute diligence and fidelity, to "turn th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> from darkne&s;s to light", in oppo&s;ition to all the difficulties and hard&s;hips they may be called to contend with, we will "highly e&s;teem them in love for their work's &s;ake"; and, in&s;tead of treating their names with reproach, we will greatly "honor them in the Lord".</NOTE>

<P>By the fir&s;t recited words in this pa&s;&s;age, the idea obviou&s;ly and intentionally conveyed to the world is, that our Planters, being en|gaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s of traffic, might be the occa&s;ion of communicating the knowledge of

him&s;elf, pag. 10. in the&s;e words,
<Q>Now this great evil, irreligion, might at fir&s;t have ea&s;i|ly been prevented growing in our Colonies; but the &s;ame evil, having been &s;uffered to grow, hath been found &s;o hard to expel, that now, after more than 60 years diligent endeavour, it is very far from being era|dicated.</Q>
If by irreligion, the great evil &s;poken of, is meant, the great impiety of &s;erv|ing God, without doing it after the mode of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church at home, it is acknow|ledge, its "growth was not prevented at fir&s;t", if it might have been; and it has been "&s;uffer|ed to grow" ever &s;ince, without interruption, until about the time of the Revolution in Eng|land, and &s;ince then by the Society for the propa|gation of the Go&s;pel in foreign parts. And it is hoped, by at lea&s;t twenty nine in thirty thro'|out New-England, that it will, in&s;tead of be|ing eradicated, go on to grow, even to the end of time, notwith&s;tanding all efforts that may be made to the contrary. If this be "irreli|gion", we are not a&s;hamed to glory in it, tho' we &s;hould be accounted "fools for thus glory|ing"; nor are there wanting tho&s;e here, who would e&s;teem it "better to die than that any man", or body of men, "&s;hould make their glorying void" in this re&s;pect. But if by the "growth of irreligion" his Lord&s;hip would be under&s;tood to mean, the increa&s;e of irreverence towards God, expre&s;&s;ed in an unbecoming

treatment of his name, perfections, and govern|ing authority; unrighteou&s;ne&s;s towards men, di&s;covered in the various ways of fraudulent and oppre&s;&s;ive dealing; and a di&s;regard to the great chri&s;tian law of &s;obriety, made manife&s;t by an indulgence to pride, luxury, extrava|gance, uncleane&s;s, and tho&s;e other lu&s;ts which argue the want of due &s;elf-government: I &s;ay, if this is what his Lord&s;hip means, by "the growth of irreligion", he had no need to have looked &s;o far for it as the&s;e di&s;tant regions. Unle&s;s the land which gave our fore-fathers birth is greatly abu&s;ed, both by its own inhabi|tants, and others who have been there, it does not come at all behind the Colonies in this kind of growth, even heightned in malignity: While yet, the whole body of <HI>duly authori&s;ed</HI> Clergymen, &s;uperior and inferior, have, if they have done their duty, been diligently employ|ing their time and pains, for more than 60 years many times told, to give check to it; and under the advantage too of that e&s;tabli&s;h|ed mode of performing divine &s;ervice, which, for a long time, was not in u&s;e here. And if the abounding growth of iniquity could not be prevented at home by the united force of &s;o many regularly ordained mini&s;ters, high and low, faithfully laboring to promote &s;o good a de&s;ign, and in conformity to the pre&s;cribed order of the be&s;t religious e&s;tabli&s;hment in the world; why &s;hould it be thought &s;trange, if

<P>What the true &s;tate of the &s;outhern Colonies is, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The pre&s;ent Arch-Bi&s;hop of Canterbury, in his &s;ociety-&s;ermon, preached, in 1741, when he was Bi&s;hop of Oxford, &s;peaking of more of the Briti&s;h Colonies than one, &s;ays, pag. 5.
<Q>There were &s;carce any foot&s;teps of Chri&s;tianity left, beyond the meer name. No Teacher was known, no religious a&s;&s;embly held; the Lord's-day di&s;tingui&s;hed only by more general di&s;&s;olutene&s;s; the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m not admini&s;tred for near twenty years to|gether, nor that of the Lord's &s;upper for near &s;ix|ty, among many thou&s;ands of people, who did not deny the obligation of the&s;e duties, but lived notwith&s;tanding in a &s;tupid neglect of them.</Q>
The more &s;outhern Colonies, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, are here held forth to view; as the de&s;cription cannot, with &s;o much as the &s;hadow of truth, be applied to any other. And according to this repre&s;entation of them, they were certainly fit objects of the Society's compa&s;&s;ionate regards; e&s;pecially as they were in|corporated principally with a de&s;ign to extend their care to &s;uch of the Plantations, who&s;e &s;tate was thus deplorably &s;ad. One would therefore naturally think that, in proportion to their ability, and the need of the&s;e places, they would have &s;ent Mi&s;&s;io|naries to perform the offices of religion among them. And yet, if we look over their ab&s;tracts, we &s;hall find, that their pious zeal has chiefly di&s;covered it &s;elf in mi&s;&s;ions to other Colonies, where Teachers abound, the wor&s;hip of God on Lord's-days is ge|nerally and religiou&s;ly attended, and the &s;acraments of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper are as duly admi|ni&s;tred as in England it&s;elf; and this to the COM|PARATIVE NEGLECT of the above de&s;cribed places, where there was &s;carce any &s;en&s;e or appearance of Chri&s;tianity. What is here &s;aid of the Society's conduct is as true a fact, as that their ab&s;tracts re|late the truth. It can, as I imagine, be accounted for upon no principle but this, that they think they &s;hall better an&s;wer the great de&s;ign of their incorpo|ration by zealous endeavours to make converts from Pre&s;byteriani&s;m and Congregationali&s;m to Epi&s;co|pacy, than by propagating the go&s;pel in places that have no Teacher, no public wor&s;hip of God, no &s;a|craments, nor any foot&s;teps of Chri&s;tianity beyond the meer name. If this is really their principle, it is hoped they will not be aver&s;e openly to avow it in words, as they virtually do in their practice.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e places are then &s;poken of, pag. ibid. where the &s;tate of things was "a little better", but &s;till" la|mentably bad". The more northern Colonies mu&s;t be here intended. But why are they repre&s;ented as in circum&s;tances lamentably bad? For no rea&s;on that we know of here that could move the compa&s;|&s;ion of the Society, but this, that EPISCOPACY had not got &s;uch &s;trong footing here as they might de|&s;ire. And however "affecting repre&s;entations might be made" of our deplorable condition by "the in|habitants in the&s;e parts, by Governors, or principal per&s;ons of note", to u&s;e the language of the &s;ermon, a becoming regard to their honor as men of truth, obliges us to &s;ay, that their repre&s;entations mu&s;t re|&s;pect our &s;tate chiefly in this point of view, viz. the non-pervalence of the Church among us. This, I know, is, in the judgment of &s;ome, the mo&s;t deplo|rable &s;tate a people can be in, however highly fa|vored they may be with the means of grace, under another mode of admini&s;tration, though more agre|able to the purity and &s;implicity of the go&s;pel.</P></NOTE> I leave to be de&s;cribed by tho&s;e who are

But this notwith&s;tanding, I will be bold to &s;ay, true Chri&s;tianity is not <HI>more generally</HI> better practi&s;ed in any part of the world. There is not a town, or village, within the&s;e largely extended Colonies, (Rhode-I&s;land Co|lony excepted) unle&s;s &s;o lately &s;ettled as not to have had time for it, but is furni&s;hed with a hou&s;e for the wor&s;hip of God, and a mini&s;ter &s;et apart for the admini&s;tration of Go&s;pel-ordi|nances in it; and, at the&s;e hou&s;es, there is every Lord's-day, and at other times al&s;o, a general re&s;ort of the people to attend on the public &s;ervices of religion. I &s;hould not wrong the truth, &s;hould I &s;ay, that neither the Lord's-day, or his wor&s;hip on that day, are more uni|ver&s;ally and devoutly regarded by any people on the earth. And as to the moral and chri|&s;tian virtues of faith in the being, perfections, revelations, and government of God, love to

<P>I &s;hall add here, whatever growth of vice there may be in the&s;e parts, it is as vi&s;ible in the cures of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries from the Society, as where they are neither employed, or de&s;ired. And from hence it may be ju&s;tly concluded, as the&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries, through the pious care of the Society, are as numerous here as any where on the American Continent, that this growth, in whatever degree it may prevail, is not owing to the want of <HI>validly ordained mini&s;ters,</HI> or <HI>any &s;pecial mode of performing divine wor&s;hip</HI>; but to other cau&s;es. What the&s;e are it would be ea&s;y, were it needful, to point out. They have operated, it may be, more powerfully in corrupting the nation at home, than its depen|dant Colonies.

<Q>The want of Seminaries in the&s;e parts, for the edu|cation of per&s;ons to &s;erve in the mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel: A great di&s;advantage; &s;o great, that there is rea&s;on to apprehend, it may one day undo all that the Society have been for many years laboring to do.</Q>
Had his Lord|&s;hip thought it worth while to have more fully informed him&s;elf of the &s;tate of things in this part of the world, he would have found no rea|&s;on for complaint upon this head. Seminaries for the education of per&s;ons to &s;erve in the mi|ni&s;try, or any other calling that would make a learned education proper, are, it may be, rather too numerous in the Colonies. They are more multiplied here, in proportion, than in Eng|land; though there may be no compari&s;on be|tween their endowments. We have no le&s;s than &s;ix public Seminaries in North-America. Two of them, one at Virginia, the other at New-York, are Epi&s;copal colleges; and a third, that at Philadelphia, has an Epi&s;copal Clergy|man at its head. The other three are open to the &s;ons of Church-men, in common with the &s;ons of others; and they are admitted with the &s;ame freedom, and, I may add, without any previou&s;ly required oaths, or &s;ub&s;criptions.
<PB N="40" REF="010579_0038_0F80D0CBCC920098">
The mo&s;t re&s;pectable of the&s;e Colleges for long &s;tanding, &amp; endowments, is that at Cambridge in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Province. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the fir&s;t College in the American world. So far back as 1636, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts General A&s;|&s;embly gave &pound;400 towards it's ri&s;e. In the next following year but one, the memorable <HI>John Har|vard</HI> left, by his la&s;t will, one half of his e&s;tate to carry on the &s;ame good de&s;ign. And this year, 1638, gives date to the foundation of this College. It has ever &s;ince been known by the name of HAR|VARD COLLEGE. It was errected principally for the Education of our &s;ons to &s;erve in the work of the Mini&s;try, that, as Churches were multiplied, there might be no want of &s;utably qualified per&s;ons to take the pa&s;toral care of them. And from hence only they were &s;upplied much the greater part of a century; and with more than a few of &s;uch as made a &s;hining figure in their day. Mo&s;t of the be&s;t cha|racter in the Country for acquired accompli&s;hments, who have &s;erved either in Church or State, were educated here, at lea&s;t until other Colleges were erected. It may be &s;aid of this, without reflection, that, in con&s;equence of donations, in former days and more lately, from our own people, and from abroad, it is the be&s;t endowed of any College on the American Continent, though it may be below all compari&s;on with the Colleges in Europe. That excellently good and catholic Gentleman, Mr. THOMAS HOLLIS of London, ought always to be mentioned with honor as one of its greate&s;t bene|factors. His liberal hand, be&s;ides kindly benefiting the College other ways, was &s;tretched out to e&s;tab|li&s;h two profe&s;&s;ors in it; the fir&s;t, in 1722, for in|&s;truction in Divinity; the other, in 1727, to teach the Mathematicks and Philo&s;ophy: Both which e&s;tabli&s;hments have been greatly conducive to the good education of the Students here. His worthy Nephew, and Heir, of the &s;ame name, and the like benevolent Spirit, has, for many years, made this College the &s;pecial object of his generous bounty; and it &s;till keeps flowing in upon it, as from a never-failing fountain. No one can enter the College-Library-Chamber, but he will have full in his eye a large collection of very valuable and curi|ou&s;ly cho&s;en books, and be told in golden cha|racters that they are his gift. I would yet &s;ay here, as this College has &s;hewn &s;o much candor and ca|tholici&s;m in its &s;entiments and conduct towards the Church of England; and as it has been &s;o helpful to the Society at home in &s;upplying them with mo&s;t of their Mi&s;&s;ionaries for the northern Colonies, it would have been but a decent compliment, if it had been accounted worthy of &s;ome &s;mall part of the large &s;um lately collected throughout England for the benefit of Seminaries in the&s;e parts of the world. Such as were of Church-principles might have been educated for the <HI>Indian-&s;ervice</HI> with as much freedom here as el&s;ewhere; and, probably, as many might have gone from hence upon the noble de&s;ign of carrying the Go&s;pel to the barba|rous natives.</NOTE> There is

It may be farther &s;aid to the honor of this College, and in proof of their being actuated, not by a &s;pirit of bigotry, but the noble &s;pirit of true chri&s;tian liberty, that, far from obliging their youths of Church-principles to join in public wor&s;hip, where it is carried on after the Con|gregational

mode, they have excu&s;ed them from it by a &s;tanding law made on purpo&s;e: Only, by the &s;ame law, they are laid under ob|ligations not to neglect divine &s;ervice perform|ed in the Epi&s;copal Church near the College; and in ca&s;e of ab&s;ence, without &s;ufficient rea|&s;on, they are &s;ubjected to the &s;ame fine the o|ther youths are, if they groundle&s;ly ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the place where God is wor|&s;hipped in our way. I &s;hall only add here, all the churches of every other denomination re|ceive con&s;tantly a full &s;upply for the mini&s;try from this and the other Seminaries; and &s;o might the church of England, if they plea&s;ed. There is no ob&s;tacle in the way, unle&s;s from them&s;elves. If therefore it has happened, that "&s;everal Churches have &s;tood vacant, becau&s;e none could be found to officiate in them", and that the "&s;ame want hath been an hinderance to the proper work of the Society, and mu&s;t needs prove an effectual bar to any farther con|&s;iderable progre&s;s in it", as his Lord&s;hip &s;peaks, pag. 20. it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed, not to the "want of Seminaries" here, of which there are enough already; but to &s;ome other cau&s;e. The Church-intere&s;t can be in no danger from this quarter.</P>
<P>Another di&s;advantage, attending the propa|gation of the Go&s;pel in the&s;e foreign parts, his Lord&s;hip takes notice of, pag. 21. in the fol|lowing

words,
<Q>What encouragement have the inhabitants of the&s;e regions to qualify them&s;elves for holy orders, while, to obtain them, they lie under the nece&s;&s;ity of cro&s;&s;ing an immen&s;e Ocean, with much inconveni|ence, danger and expence; which tho&s;e who come hither on that errand can but ill bear. And if they have the fortune to arrive &s;afe, being here without friends, and with|out acquaintance, they have the &s;ad bu&s;ine&s;s to undergo, of pre&s;enting them&s;elves un|known to per&s;ons unknown, without any re|commendation or introduction, except cer|tain papers in their pocket. Are there not circum&s;tances in this ca&s;e, &s;ufficient to deter every ordinary courage, and to dampt the mo&s;t adventurous &s;pirit.</Q></P>
<P>It is acknowledged, it would be a great di&s;|couragement to the &s;ons of the Church from qualifying them&s;elves for holy orders, and I may &s;ay to others al&s;o educated in the princi|ples of the Country from taking them, if, in order to obtain them, they mu&s;t cro&s;s a wide ocean at THEIR OWN EXPENCE. But this, I pre&s;ume, is rarely, if ever the ca&s;e. They are, as we &s;uppo&s;e upon good information, freed from this di&s;couragement by being well pro|vided for, if not by the Society in part at lea&s;t, by tho&s;e who expect the benefit of their labors. As for my &s;elf, was I a candidate for holy or|ders,
<PB N="44" REF="010579_0042_0F80D0CE33802888">
I &s;hould e&s;teem it a happy circum&s;tance in the ca&s;e, to have &s;o fair an opportunity to vi&s;it the land of our fore-father's nativity. And I believe there are few but are en|couraged by this very thing that is repre&s;ent|ed as a matter of &s;o great di&s;couragement. Their "being there without friends, and with|out acquaintance", is a difficulty made by ima|gination only. As they go from hence upon the nobly profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of taking holy orders, that they may be validly commi&s;&s;i|oned to propagate the Go&s;pel, it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould long want "friends or acquaint|ance", if it were only among the members of the Society, they are &s;o numerous, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o earne&s;tly engaged in promoting this pious de&s;ign. It is true, the "bu&s;ine&s;s of pre|&s;enting them&s;elves unknown to tho&s;e unknown friends would be &s;ad", if they had no "recom|mendation except certain papers in their pock|et". It is fit they &s;hould have the&s;e papers in readine&s;s to be &s;een. Their moral qualificati|ons can be known, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, only in this way. But it is as proper they &s;hould have knowledge in their heads, as papers in their pockets. And it is hoped, the Society &s;end no Mi&s;&s;ionaries but &s;uch as are able to recommend them&s;elves in the former, as well as the latter of the&s;e ways.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip now comes to the la&s;t and greate&s;t inconvenience, "the want of Bi&s;hops

in our Colonies". "This", &s;ays he, pag. 22.
<Q>Be&s;ides other di&s;advantages attending it, appears, in particular, to be the fundamental cau&s;e of the want of native Mini&s;ters. The one removed; the other, it &s;eems, would cea&s;e of cour&s;e. For can it be imagined, could or|ders be had on the &s;ame terms there as el&s;e|where, that a number of the natives &s;uffici|ent for the &s;ervice of the Church, would not offer them&s;elves in tho&s;e, as they do, in all other parts of Chri&s;tendom.</Q></P>
<P>The want of "native mini&s;ters", if this is really the ca&s;e, is not, I believe, owing to any of the cau&s;es his Lord&s;hip has mentioned, not excepting that of there being "no Bi&s;hops in the Colonies". If I may &s;peak here with the &s;ame freedom that I think, I would &s;ay, there is, in one re&s;pect, an obvious difference between our people, and tho&s;e who profe&s;s them&s;elves Church-men. The former generally &s;end their &s;ons to one or other of our Colleges with a view to their being educated for the mini&s;try; this is rarely done by the latter. Should any a&s;k the rea&s;on of this;&mdash;it mu&s;t be plainly &s;aid, our Churches are numerous for a new Country, many of them large, and well capable of pro|viding for their mini&s;ters; and, by a &s;wift in|crea&s;e of inhabitants and new-&s;ettlements, they are daily growing both in number and ability to &s;upport their Clergy. There is herefrom
<PB N="46" REF="010579_0044_0F80D0CFBAB51168">
the pro&s;pect of a tolerable provi&s;ion for our &s;ons, if educated to &s;erve in the mini&s;try. Whereas, there are very few Epi&s;copal churches that "&s;tand upon their own legs";&mdash;and by far the greater part of the other are &s;mall in num|ber, weak in ability, and in&s;ufficient to main|tain their own mini&s;try, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Society at home. It is this that di&s;courages the Church-people from bringing up their &s;ons for Clergymen. They chu&s;e rather to provide for them &s;ome other way. And as to pro&s;elytes from us, the temptation ordinarily is &s;o &s;mall, that few are overcome by it until they have found there was little or no pro&s;pect of their being employed to greater advantage. No one need now be at a lo&s;s to a&s;&s;ign the true cau&s;e of the "want of native mini&s;ters".</P>
<P>But if Bi&s;hops &s;hould be &s;ent to the Colonies, the people would generally turn Church-men;&mdash; the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate of things would &s;oon be inverted;&mdash;Epi&s;coparians would quickly ex|ceed the other denominations of Chri&s;tians, as much as they now exceed them.</P>
<P>This, without all doubt, is the grand point aimed at; and there may be &s;ome, both at home and here, who really think all this would &s;peedily come into event. But tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the genius, temper and principles of the Coloni&s;ts, at lea&s;t in tho&s;e parts where they are mo&s;t numerous, have not the
<PB N="47" REF="010579_0045_0F80D0D05FE471A8">
lea&s;t motion of fear excited in them from the pro&s;pect of any &s;uch effect of the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops. They are rather concerned, lea&s;t it &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of hurtful con&s;equences both to them and us. Such con&s;equences would certainly be the effect, if the&s;e Bi&s;hops &s;hould make u&s;e of their SUPERIORITY, as mo&s;t probably they would, &s;ooner or later, to influence our great men here, and much grea|ter ones at home, to project, and endeavour to carry into execution, mea&s;ures to force the growth of the Church. It may be relied on, our people would not be ea&s;y, if re&s;tained in the exerci&s;e of that "liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made them free"; yea, they would ha|zard every thing dear to them, their e&s;tates, their very lives, rather than &s;uffer their necks to be put under that yoke of bondage, which was &s;o &s;adly galling to their fathers, and occa|&s;ioned their retreat into this di&s;tant land, that they might enjoy the freedom of men and chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip &s;peaks, pag. ibid. of the want of Bi&s;hops, as the "more heavily lamentable", becau&s;e "all &s;ects of Prote&s;tant chri&s;tians at home, and all &s;ave one (meaning the Church of England) throughout the Colonies, have the full enjoyment of their religion".</P>
<P>A &s;tranger to the Colonies would be apt to think, from this cau&s;e of lamentation, that the
<PB N="48" REF="010579_0046_0F80D0D3C90CD178">
Epi&s;copal Churches here, in&s;tead of enjoying the liberty that is common to the other denominations of chri&s;tians, were in a &s;tate of religious oppre&s;&s;i|on: Whereas the real truth is, not the lea&s;t re|&s;traint is laid upon their chri&s;tian liberty. They wor&s;hip God when, where, and how they plea&s;e, without hindrance or mole&s;tation: Yea, they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other denominations in this re&s;pect, that they are the only objects of the pious charitable help of the riche&s;t Society in all England incorporated upon a religious de&s;ign. And they are be&s;ides, within the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Province, [how it is in the other Colonies I know not] favoured by a &s;tanding law that excu&s;es them from paying towards the &s;upport of any mini&s;ters but their own.</P>
<P>But they have "no Bi&s;hops". Very true; and they have no ju&s;t rea&s;on for complaint up|on this head. For, let it be con&s;idered,</P>
<P>Throughout an extent of territory more than 500 miles in length, comprehending &s;even Pro|vinces, the four New-England ones, and tho&s;e of New-York, the Jer&s;ies, and Pen&s;ylvania; I &s;ay, throughout the&s;e largely extended Provin|ces, &s;o well inhabited that they contain more than a million of &s;ouls, there are not, by the be&s;t infor|mation I can get, more than eight or nine Epi&s;copal churches that &s;upport them&s;elves. All the re&s;t, to the amount of about &s;ixty, more or le&s;s, chiefly made up of converts from the other denomina|tions
<PB N="49" REF="010579_0047_0F80D0D4634CBE40">
of Chri&s;tians, are &s;o far upheld in their ex|i&s;tence by the Society at home, at the expence of not le&s;s than &s;ome thou&s;ands &s;terling per an|num, that, &s;hould this be withdrawn, they would &s;oon &s;ink away for want of needed a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In&s;tead now of being contented with the receipt of &s;o much pious charity, they think it hard, and complain of it as a mo&s;t lamentable thing, that as many thou&s;ands &s;terling more are not annually laid out for the maintainance of Bi&s;hops among them. Is this rea&s;onable? Would Church-men them&s;elves think it &s;o in regard of other denominations of chri&s;tians be&s;ides them|&s;elves? Should any of the&s;e denominations, in like circum&s;tances, make the like complaints, in|&s;i&s;ting that they were not &s;uffered "fully to en|joy their religion", none, it may be, would treat their complaints with more contempt, than tho&s;e who are them&s;elves &s;o loud in making them. And yet, I know not, in regard of real merit, but other denominations would have as good a right to complain, as tho&s;e who profe&s;s them|&s;elves members of the Church of England. For they are the de&s;cendants from ance&s;tors, who &s;ubdued &amp; cultivated this rude wilderne&s;s, amid&s;t a thou&s;and difficulties &amp; hazards, &s;o as to make it the plea&s;ant fruitful land we now behold it; here|by adding to the extent, &s;trength and glory of the Briti&s;h Crown: Nor has that &s;acred Maje&s;ty who wears it more loyal &s;ubjects, even in Eng|land it&s;elf: And as they are far more numerous
<PB N="50" REF="010579_0048_0F80D0D5822B9290">
than the Epi&s;coparians, they are in proportion more able, and I am &s;ure they would be as willing, to exert them&s;elves, if called to it, at the peril of their lives, in defence of his Per&s;on and Domi|nions.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip farther mentions it as an aggra|vating circum&s;tance attending the want of Bi&s;h|ops, that "even the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition within a Province lately added to the Briti&s;h Dominions, is compleatly allowed in all points; it hath Bi&s;h|ops and Seminaries".</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed, if Bi&s;hops are allowed in that Province, they are provided for by e&s;tabli&s;hments within it&s;elf, when the inhabitants were &s;ubjects of the King of France; not at the expence of the Briti&s;h Crown or Nation, as it mu&s;t be if Bi&s;hops are &s;ent to &s;uper-intend the Epi&s;copal churches in the Colonies; which makes a wide difference be|twixt the two ca&s;es. But be this as it may, the fact it&s;elf may be e&s;teemed certain, as it is affirm|ed by his Lord&s;hip, who&s;e &s;ituation leaves no room to &s;u&s;pect a mi&s;take in a matter of this na|ture. And an a&s;toni&s;hing one it is to us in the&s;e parts of the world! THE ROMISH SUPERSTITI|ON COMPLEATLY ALLOWED IN ALL POINTS! What more &s;urpri&s;ing! What more oppo&s;ite to one of the great ends propo&s;ed by King William IIId, in incorporating the Society for the propa|gation of the Go&s;pel in the&s;e foreign parts! What could more powerfully ob&s;truct one main
<PB N="51" REF="010579_0049_0F80D0D59F9EF880">
branch of their proper bu&s;ine&s;s, the prevention, or extirpation, of Popery in the Colonies! We may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, his Lord&s;hip, and the whole incorporated body of which he is a member, are &s;trongly affected with grief at this COMPLEAT ALLOWANCE; and that they will unite in all pro|per remon&s;trances upon &s;o important an occa&s;ion. How far articles of capitulation may have made way for &s;uch an <HI>allowance,</HI> I pretend not to judge; but if, in virtue of any of them, it was made ne|ce&s;&s;ary, a con&s;ent to them was highly impolitic, and may be of dangerous con&s;equence to the Briti&s;h intere&s;t, more e&s;pecially in that part of America.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip concludes what he had to &s;ay upon the head of Bi&s;hops with the&s;e words, pag. 25. "This point obtained, [the mi&s;&s;ion of Bi&s;hops to the Colonies] the American Church will &s;oon go out of its infant &s;tate; be able to &s;tand upon its own legs; and with|out foreign help &s;upport and &s;pread it&s;elf. THEN THE BUSINESS OF THIS SOCIETY WILL HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE HAPPY ISSUE INTENDED."</P>
<P>The conduct of the Society has, for many years, given us rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect their MAIN VIEW was to EPISCOPISE the Colonies; but we were never before, that I know of, told &s;o in direct terms. His Lord&s;hip, in the pre&s;ence of the Society them&s;elves, has not only &s;pecified
<PB N="52" REF="010579_0050_0F80D0D662623B18">
their BUSINESS, but in plain words declared, that it will be brought to its INTENDED HAP|PY ISSUE, if they may "but have Bi&s;hops, and the Church go out of its infant &s;tate &s;o as to &s;upport and &s;pread it&s;elf". We are firmly per|&s;uaded, if their proper bu&s;ine&s;s is here pointed out, and they pro&s;ecute it with the greate&s;t vi|gor, the "happy i&s;&s;ue they intend" will never take place, according to their de&s;ire, at lea&s;t in the New-England Colonies. The&s;e, for &s;cores of years, have been the &s;pecial object of their &s;ol|licitous care; and may have co&s;t them, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, more a great deal than thirty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. And what has been the effect? There has gradually been the ri&s;e of about thirty three Epi&s;copal churches, by far the greater part of which are &s;o &s;mall in number, and to this day &s;o in&s;ufficient for their own &s;upport, that, &s;hould the Society's pious charity towards them be di&s;|continued, there would be no probable hope of their long continuance in being: Whereas, the Congregational and Pre&s;byterian churches only, without any charitable help from abroad, and in oppo&s;ition to all efforts to prevent it, have in|crea&s;ed to the number of 550; and they go on increa&s;ing, as much in proportion beyond the E|pi&s;copal churches as they exceed them in number and ability. Why then &s;hould the Society expect "the happy i&s;&s;ue they intend"? There is no rea|&s;onable room for hope in the ca&s;e: E&s;pecially, if it be remembered, that we, in the&s;e parts, not

only know the ERRAND of our fore-fathers into this Country, but have been well indoctrinated in the PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIAN LIBERTY. "Old grudges and jealou&s;ies" are no "ob&s;tacles" in the way of our going over to the Church; and as to "ob&s;olete piques &amp; groundle&s;s fears", they are as fully "extingui&s;hed" here as in "England". We prefer our own mode of wor&s;hip and di&s;ci|pline to that of the Engli&s;h church; and we do it upon principle, as really believing that it comes nearer to the purity and &s;implicity of Go&s;pel- direction. And as the&s;e are the generally pre|vailing &s;entiments in New-England, and their con|duct has all along been generally conformable hereto, we have no fearful apprehen&s;ions of a de|parture herefrom; but are rather fully per&s;uaded, they will &s;tand fa&s;t: to their principles, and clo&s;ely adhere to that mode of wor&s;hip which has hither|to been in u&s;e among them, whatever attempts may be made to turn them a&s;ide.</P>

<P>AS you &s;aid nothing to me of the Society-&s;ermon, preached by Dr. Warburton, Lord Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, in 1766, I conclude you had not &s;een it. While I was fini&s;hing the foregoing remarks, his Lord&s;hip's third vol. of &s;ermons on various occa&s;ions, in which this was contained, was put into my hands. It will not, I believe, be unacceptable, if I tran&s;cribe two or three pa&s;&s;ages in it for your peru&s;al.</P>
<P>Pag. 65.
<Q>But though the zeal of the fir&s;t Coloni&s;ts (rekindled by this violent remove to the other Hemi|&s;phere) kept religion alive and active, yet their poverty di&s;abled them from &s;upplying fuel to the vital flame; I mean, provi&s;ion for A PREACHING MINISTRY. In&s;omuch, that without the kindly a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Mother Country, this new chri|&s;tian Common-wealth had been, as the Roman hi&s;torian expre&s;&s;es it of the imperial City in it's cradle, Res unius Aetatis. Again&s;t this danger, a timely aid was to be provided. And the Foun|ders of our Society,</Q>
&amp;c. We doubt not his Lord|&s;hip's thorow acquaintance with the hi&s;tory of other more important Countries, even from their fir&s;t ri&s;e; but the &s;tory of this has certainly been below his notice. Otherwi&s;e, he would have known, that &s;ome of the "fir&s;t Coloni&s;ts" were men of ample fortunes for that day.&mdash;He would have known al&s;o, if it was their unhappine&s;s to be poor, that, notwith&s;tanding their poverty, they did in fact "&s;upply fuel to the vital flame", that is, make provi&s;ion for a PRECHING MINISTRY; in&s;omuch, that, "without any kindly a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Mother-Country", they had a &s;uffi|ciency of Mini&s;ters for the performance of the public offices of religion, wherever they extended their &s;et|tlements.
<PB N="55" REF="010579_0053_0F80D0D8DE0D63D0">
He would have known farther, that there had been nearly the revolution of an age, if a century may be &s;o called, and an increa&s;e of Churches to &s;ome hundreds, with Pa&s;tors at the head of them, before the exi&s;tence of that incorporated body which was to &s;upply a <HI>preaching Mini&s;try,</HI> without which religion could not be kept alive. And He would have known moreover, that, &s;ince the incorporation of this Society, the growth of Churches, and their &s;upply with Mi|ni&s;ters, at lea&s;t in the New-England Colonies, has been much more than ten times greater without any help from them, than where they have afforded it at an immen&s;e expence.</P>
<P>Pag. 67.
<Q>Here then we might well leave the&s;e contentious people to them&s;elves, did not a mi&s;er|able circum&s;tance &s;till call for our rejected charity: I mean, the &s;preading GENTILISM in the Colonies them&s;elves.</Q>
Not a brutal ignorance of God, as among the Savage natives; but a BLASPHEMOUS CONTEMPT of his holy di&s;pen&s;ations, among our <HI>Philo&s;ophic Coloni&s;ts</HI>". With what truth, or ju&s;tice, this reproach is ca&s;t upon the Colonies may be &s;een in the foregoing remarks. Only it may be &s;aid here, if there are any "Philo&s;ophic Coloni&s;ts" who "bla&s;|pheou&s;ly contemn God's holy di&s;pen&s;ations", they are not confined to the de&s;cendants from "Fanatics"; but may as well be looked for in the Church, that has been the &s;pecial object of the Society's care; they them&s;elves being judges.</P>
<P>It follows in the next words,
<Q>The origine of which folly was, however, no more than this.&mdash; The rich product of the Plantations &s;oon &s;upplied the Coloni&s;ts with all the conveniences of life. And men are no &s;ooner at ea&s;e, than they are ready
<PB N="56" REF="010579_0054_0F80D0D9802AADC8">
addre&s;&s;ed to plea&s;ure. So that the &s;econd venture of our Coloni&s;ts was for <HI>the luxuries of &s;ocial life:</HI> Among which the commodity called FREE-THINK|ING was carefully con&s;igned to them, as that which gave a reli&s;h and &s;ea&s;oning to all the re&s;t.&mdash;Thus it came to pa&s;s, that the VERY PEOPLE, who&s;e fathers were driven for con&s;cience-&s;ake into the <HI>wa&s;te and howling wilderne&s;s,</HI> is now AS READY TO LAUGH AT THAT BIBLE, the mo&s;t precious relict of their ruined fortunes, as at their ruffs and collar|bands.</Q>
Surely, his Lord&s;hip would not have &s;aid this, had it not been told him by &s;ome, profe&s;&s;ing an acquaintance with the po&s;terity of tho&s;e, who were driven into this wilderne&s;s. But be they who they may, "the truth was not in them".&mdash;They could not more ba&s;ely or fal&s;ely have &s;poken evil of them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, the reproachful light in which the Colonies are placed, more e&s;pecially in the two la&s;t Society-&s;ermons, may po&s;&s;ibly tend to move the com|pa&s;&s;ion of &s;erious good people at home, and enlarge the exerci&s;e of their pious charity towards us; but the growth of the Church here, the great thing in view, will rather &s;uffer than gain by it. Were the&s;e, and a few more &s;ermons breathing the &s;ame Spirit, to be reprinted and di&s;per&s;ed among the Coloni&s;ts, it would, I am per&s;uaded, di&s;&s;erve the Church much more, than the mi&s;&s;ion of as many Bi&s;hops as could be wi&s;hed, would &s;erve it.</P>
