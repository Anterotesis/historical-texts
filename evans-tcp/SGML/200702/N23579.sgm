<P>WHY did I &s;uffer my&s;elf to be hurried from Boulogne?

and a retro&s;pect &s;till wor&s;e. You are the only friend in whom I dare confide, and to ea&s;e the fulne&s;s of a woe-fraught heart, I mu&s;t inform you, that Stamford has proved a villain. You are thunder&s;truck! While I fancy my&s;elf as ju&s;t awak|ened from a dream of horror.</P>
<P>You knew not that my parents were people of large fortune. In &s;hort it was a &s;ecret which I arrived not at my&s;elf till after you had left our convent. But it is now ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould be ac|quainted with circum&s;tances which contributed to render me totally neglected by and unknown to my neare&s;t relatives.&mdash;</P>
<P>My mother being of a gay di&s;po|&s;ition could not be per&s;uaded that happine&s;s was mo&s;tly found in do|me&s;tic life: but from adhering too &s;trictly to an ill formed judgment, plunged into a vortex of plea&s;ure and lo&s;t &s;ight of it for ever.

every wi&s;h, till he &s;u&s;pected &s;he had formed an attachment of the tendere&s;t nature for an officer in the navy. He &s;poke very har&s;hly to her on the &s;ubject; but being innocent of the crime alluded to, my mother thought her&s;elf ill treat|ed. Con&s;equently di&s;regarded his reproaches, &s;et his threats at defi|ance; and merely for the &s;ake of bravado kept up her acquaintance with the captain. A conduct &s;o de|rogatory from prudence furni&s;hed conver&s;ation for the town. My fa|ther &s;oon quitted England; his e&s;|tates were mortgaged; and my mo|ther left with child of me, and to|tally de&s;titute. Her relations had imbibed a &s;trong notion of her guilt, and po&s;itively refu&s;ed &s;eeing her. Her &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;honor had not gone farther than appearance. They had treated her with indignity, and her &s;pirit was too high to permit a vin|dication of her conduct to tho&s;e who were &s;o ea&s;ily prejudiced a|gain&s;t her; and though reduced to

Fortunately a friend in the country, who had heard of her &s;i|tuation, died; and from motives of compa&s;&s;ion left her &s;ixty pounds a year.

<P>I need not animadvert on the time you and I pa&s;&s;ed at the con|vent: but date the ri&s;e of mi&s;|fortune from the time my mother met Mr. Stamford.</P>
<P>He had been acquainted with my father; and when &s;he was &s;eized with that dreadful di&s;ea&s;e which terminated life, &s;he claimed his protection for her orphan child (who was the only daughter of his friend) and conjured him to do the utmo&s;t in his power in &s;triving to find whether my father was yet alive; and if he were to convey me to him even if in the Ea&s;t In|dies, having been informed he went there on leaving England.

<HEAD>To Mademoi&s;elle D'Aubigny, at St. Omer's.</HEAD>
<P>You are impatient to know why my name is changed, and &s;till more the particulars of Stamford's perfidy.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="031198_0010_0FEB4F5E857BD2E8">A month had &s;carce elap&s;ed after my mother's funeral, when I expre&s;&s;ed my wi&s;h of going to St. Omer's. Mr. Stamford objected to it; &s;aid I was &s;carce fifteen and be|ing a hand&s;ome girl, de&s;titute of fortune, and apparently of friends, would be &s;ubjected to a number of in&s;ulting offers from men of rank, merely from the want of a pro|tector.</P>
<P>Convinced of his having my intere&s;t at heart, I felt &s;atisfied with the refu&s;al, though mortified in the idea of not &s;eeing my dear Ma|rianne &s;o &s;oon as I had hoped for. However it was nece&s;&s;ary that my imagination &s;hould be kept on the wing of expectation; con&s;equently a fortnight after he informed me that a letter from England had given him intelligence of my fa|ther's return from the Indies; and in a jocular tone, a&s;ked 'if I &s;hould not be afraid of cro&s;&s;ing the ocean?' 'Can you put the que&s;tion to me, my dear &s;ir?' I replied with quick|ne&s;s,
<PB N="13" REF="031198_0011_0FEB4F6021ACD598">
'Shall I not go to claim the ble&s;&s;ing of an only parent, and vin|dicate the conduct of an injured mother?' Tears bur&s;t from my eyes, which the hypocrite wiped away, while he bid me prepare for our voyage on the following morn|ing.</P>
<P>We embarked on board the packet, and at &s;ix o'clock the &s;ame evening landed at Dover.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations I experienced from imagining my&s;elf in the &s;ame nation with my father, are inde&s;cri|bable; and I had actually conned over every expre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s which I meant to make u&s;e of, to &s;often the &s;everity of his anger to|wards the memory of my poor de|pared mother; but the plea&s;ing il|lu&s;ion vani&s;hed on Mr. Stamford's propo&s;ing our &s;taying that night at the inn Unaccu&s;tomed to follow the dictates of my own rea&s;on, when oppo&s;ed by that of another, I acquie&s;ced in his de&s;ire, and re|tired early to re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031198_0012_0FEB4F61CEFB4BF0">About one o'clock, I was awaken|ed by &s;ome one opening the door of my chamber, and in&s;tantly de|manded who was there? No an|&s;wer was returned.</P>
<P>I li&s;tened, but every thing was perfectly quiet. Recollecting that Mr. Stamford &s;lept in the adjoining apartment, and concluding no one would dare offer to mole&s;t me while under his protection (having before our landing taken the pre|caution to de&s;ire I would call him father till my own was found), I quieted my fears, and was going to &s;leep once more; on a &s;udden, the bed curtains were drawn a&s;ide, though it was &s;oftly as po&s;&s;ible. 'Gracious God,' exclaimed I, what can be the meaning of this? Where is Mr. Stamford?' continued I, &s;tart|ing up at the &s;ame time. 'Be not alarmed, my dear D'Arcy, (&s;aid a voice which I knew to be his) I mean not to hurt you.' However I found he was upon the point of getting into bed. Oh! Marianne, I

&s;hudder even now, though &s;ecured from the danger. I jumped out on the other &s;ide, &s;creaming mo&s;t vio|lently; he caught my hand and begged I would be pacified; but it was too late, my cries had awak|ened the people who &s;lept in the inn, and they had a&s;&s;embled at the door and were demanding ad|mittance. Fear gave me &s;trength, I di&s;engaged my&s;elf from his hold and ran to open the door. The fir&s;t per&s;on who pre&s;ented him&s;elf to my view was Mr. O&s;born. Re|gardle&s;s of every thing, but my e&s;|cape from Stamford, I threw my arms around him and implored pro|tection for the &s;ake of heaven, but fainted the moment that the &s;en|tence had e&s;caped my lips. Stam|ford took this opportunity of &s;aying I was his wife, but had eloped and gone with a vagrant fellow to France, whither he had followed and was bringing me back; but that determined not to &s;tay with him, I had behaved in that manner,
<PB N="16" REF="031198_0014_0FEB4F6B67EF2118">
in hopes &s;ome one el&s;e would fa|vour my e&s;cape a &s;econd time. Every per&s;on pitied the unfortu|nate hu&s;band, while I got abu&s;ed as an infamous creature, till the chamber-maid (an innocent girl, who had only been there a few days) &s;aid, 'Laws, &s;ir, I thought as how the lady called you father la&s;t night?' Staggered by the dread of being di&s;covered, he he&s;itated and was beginning a plau&s;ible &s;tory about my de&s;iring he would &s;uffer it. But Mr. O&s;born's humanity was not to be trifled with, he in|&s;i&s;ted that every &s;yllable the other advanced was fal&s;e, and declared he would not relinqui&s;h my cau&s;e, nor quit the room till I returned to a&s;|&s;ure him of the truth (for they had taken me into another apartment on my fainting).</P>
<P>Stamford putting on a &s;tern air, a&s;ked,
<Q>If he meant to doubt his word? Said that room was his, and no one &s;hould &s;tay in it longer than he cho&s;e.</Q>
This behaviour gave
<PB N="17" REF="031198_0015_0FEB4F6D08AE1B60">
every one pre&s;ent a &s;u&s;picion, from what the girl had &s;aid, that I was ill-treated; and after my recovery, the landlady having a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in putting my clothes on, they all en|tered the apartment, eager to hear in what manner I could ju&s;tify my|&s;elf.</P>
<P>You know my mother took infi|nite pains, in &s;triving to perfect me in the Engli&s;h tongue, con&s;equent|ly I found no difficulty in making them under&s;tand me. I related that part of my &s;tory, which concern|ed Stamford, in an artle&s;s &s;train, while he with dreadful imprecati|ons, contradicted all I had advanced. Provoked to the la&s;t degree, I told him,
<Q>that let what I had &s;aid be true or fal&s;e, I was determined not to continue any longer under his protection.</Q>
'Stop, madam,' &s;aid the wretch,
<Q>you are my ward at lea&s;t, and whoever dares to pro|tect you, &s;hall find the laws of this country will afford me ample re|venge.</Q>
<Q>You need not be inform|ed,</Q>
<PB N="18" REF="031198_0016_0FEB4F71A9DE0480">
returned Mr. O&s;born,
<Q>that the laws of this country will not permit an unprotected female to be injured by the brutal machi|nations of a villanous guardian; and to convince you I am as well quainted with the laws of Eng|land as your&s;elf, if, the lady will tru&s;t to my honour, in commiting her&s;elf to my care till we arrive in town, I will place her under the immediate protection of my mother and &s;i&s;ter, and bid defi|ance to all your efforts in an at|tempt to regain her. My name is O&s;born, you are at liberty to u&s;e your plea&s;ure in regard to law. Favour me with your hand, madam,</Q>
turning to me,
<Q>and al|low me to lead you out of this room; my carriage will not be long; getting ready, and the mo|ment it is we will &s;et out.</Q>
So &s;ay|ing he led me out of the room in triumph.</P>
<P>Stamford raved, and would cer|tainly have &s;truck Mr. O&s;born, had
<PB N="19" REF="031198_0017_0FEB4F73471A2550">
not a gentleman who was going to France the next morning prevented the blow; in &s;hort, he was obliged to make a pri&s;oner of him till we had left the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I did not at the time, con&s;ider the impropriety of con&s;enting to ac|company an elegant young man, alone in a po&s;t chai&s;e; reflecting not a moment that the judgment of the world is decided by appear|ances, gladly accepted the offer al|mo&s;t before it was made. I mu&s;t re&s;ign the pen this moment, hear|ing Mi&s;s O&s;born's foot on the &s;tairs, con&s;equently cannot conclude this till to-morrow.</P>
<P>* * * * * * *</P>
<P>Once more I am &s;eated at my writing-de&s;k, to &s;atisfy my Mari|anne's apprehen&s;ions for my &s;afety. In the cour&s;e of our journey my de|liverer &s;aid, 'He &s;hould not have been at Dover, but in the expectati|on of meeting the Chevalier Chat|telherhault and his &s;i&s;ter, the packet was arrived in which they were to have came, con&s;equently he con|cluded
<PB N="20" REF="031198_0018_0FEB4F7B300935F0">
him&s;elf at liberty to return to town.'</P>
<P>In a very delicate manner, he hinted, that my &s;ituation was both aukward and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and really wi&s;hed I could be prevailed on to a&s;&s;ume the name of Chattelherhault, till my father could be applied to. I objected to it, by &s;aying, his friends mu&s;t certainly arrive at a knowledge of the impo&s;ition, and for ever after I &s;hould be regarded by them in a degrading light. Mr. O&s;born begged my pardon for hav|ing propo&s;ed what was di&s;agreeable to me, but &s;aid, 'he only wi&s;hed me to a&s;&s;ume that name on my intro|duction to them, till he found an op|portunity of making them acquiant|ed with my &s;tory, as his father, though a good hearted man, had his peculiarities; however, as I was apparently aver&s;e to the propo&s;al, he would relinqui&s;h the thought.'</P>
<P>A thou&s;and painful ideas ru&s;hed on my mind at the moment he was &s;peaking; Sir John O&s;born might
<PB N="21" REF="031198_0019_0FEB4F7CED590A10">
command me to leave his hou&s;e that in&s;tant; I was a friendle&s;s, an unprotected &s;tranger in the nation. Could I but gain an a&s;ylum for a week, my father might be found; I &s;hould be acknowledged as his daughter, and the fraud pa&s;&s;ed on Sir John's family would be looked over, when they under&s;tood I was &s;ole heire&s;s to a man of large for|tune.</P>
<P>This thought determined me. I told him he was at liberty to act as he thought proper. Now imagine me in the character of a French lady of fa&s;hion, arrived in England, to be introduced at the Briti&s;h court. Oh! Marianne, this attempt at vi|vacity, however it might appear like my&s;elf when at Boulogne, but ill &s;uits me at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>You, no doubt, think me highly blameable, and conclude I cannot e&s;cape detection; but to &s;atisfy your doubts I mu&s;t inform you, Mr. Osborn has written to the Che|valier, who promi&s;es to remain in

France, and keep his &s;i&s;ter &s;till at their chateau, till he hears further from him.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit telling you, when we arrived in St. James's Square, Mr. Osborn told Sir John, that the Chevalier arrived with me in the packet, but an affair of honour de|manding his return to France, he had entru&s;ted me to his care.</P>
<P>It is near three weeks &s;ince I have been here, but the anxiety I &s;uffered at Dover has confined me to my room ever &s;ince; I even dread the idea of finding my &s;elf in a good &s;tate of health, merely from the fear of being detected. However let fate do with me as it will,</P>

<P>WHAT can be the rea&s;on for my not having heard from you? Surely my Marianne can never mean to de&s;ert me becau&s;e I am in di&s;tre&s;s!

Fortunately her brother was engaged, before the party was made, or he would have been our e&s;cort. We were in the &s;tage box. At the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t act, Stamford appeared in the oppo&s;ite one; a dreadful &s;ickne&s;s &s;eized me, and I could only articulate, "I am very ill. Lady O&s;born allow me to leave the theatre." Terrified at the alteration in my looks, neither her lady &s;hip or daughter would &s;uf|fer me to go alone, but quitted the hou&s;e in&s;tantly with me; and 'twas with the utmo&s;t difficulty I was

kept from fainting in the carriage: the dread of his following, and claiming me when it &s;lopt, operated &s;o &s;orcibly on my mind. Mr. O&s;born is now convinced of the im|propriety of my remaining any longer with his family, and has at length promi&s;ed, that the Chevalier &s;hall write an excu&s;e for being ob|liged to defer his vi&s;it, and likewi&s;e de&s;iring my return immediately. Though he &s;till in&s;i&s;ts, that I have nothing to fear from Stamford, be|cau&s;e when he finds I am counte|nanced by people of rank, he will drop all hopes of regaining me. But I know his di&s;po&s;ition too well, to imbibe a notion of the kind; and &s;hall be perfectly mi&s;erable, till &s;afe in the protection of my deare&s;t D'Aubigny.&mdash;Should Stamford di&s;|cover with whom I am, how, or in what manner &s;hall I be extricated?

Picture to your&s;elf an old &s;oul near &s;eventy years of age, who&s;e hair had once been dark, but from the ravages of Time, turned three parts white, Imagine this hoary hair, frizzed, not to &s;ay dre&s;t, into no form whatever, &s;ome long, dangling from what &s;he terms the toupee, while the re&s;t &s;o &s;hort, appears envi|ou&s;ly peeping from under a very &s;mall fa&s;hionable white bonnet, which, to make the owner look more like an old ewe dre&s;t lamb|fa&s;hion, mu&s;t be &s;tuck on one &s;ide,

with her veil pinned up, to di&s;co|ver a broad red face, ornamented with what I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he calls dim|ples; but what even I cannot find a &s;imile for. Her twinkling grey orbs look a&s;kaunce on a bottle no&s;e, and her mouth, when laughing, might ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for a ga&s;h from ear to ear; but what deity mu&s;t I invoke to a a&s;&s;i&s;t me in de&s;crib|ing her nonpareils of teeth? which are decayed nearly to the gums, and what few &s;tumps remain in &s;ight are quite &s;ufficient to turn the &s;tronge&s;t &s;tomach. Her per&s;on, fat and un|weildy, is decked out in a blue &s;atin gown, ornamented with cocq-le-coc riband, and a petticoat of the &s;ame &s;taring colour, with a pink cloak, trimmed with black lace. I will give you a flight &s;ketch of her con|ver&s;ation pre&s;ently. It &s;eems &s;he has &s;everal children: but a &s;on whom &s;he calls Jacky is her favourite, becau&s;e he happens to be one of the mo&s;t egregious fops living; the daughter

who accompanied her, is her aver|&s;ion. The poor thing has the mi&s;|fortune to be amiable. I mu&s;t bring you acquainted with her by the name of Nan, which her mamma in thick li&s;p calls her in every com|pany. In her u&s;ual &s;tile, Mrs. Cri&s;p was rallying me on Grenvill's ac|count, and Mrs. Rawlins, to &s;hew her wit, began with a loud laugh: 'and, I dare &s;ay matrimony would agree with you.

The &s;equel will &s;hew I wanted not &s;cope for ridicule.

Wil|ling to humour the joke, I replied, 'Oh none, madam, and I a&s;&s;ure you I have no objection to the marriage &s;tate; the difficulty lies in getting the other &s;ex in the mind.' Ah, I know you girls, all loves to get the men in your &s;uit; but its us widows they make up to for wives: but come now I will tell you where to go to know who is to be your hu&s;band.

'How long did he &s;ay it is to be before Mi&s;s Rawlins is married,' interrupted Mrs. Cri&s;p looking &s;ignificantly at me.

<P>My dear Mademoi&s;elle D'Aubig|ny has permitted me the honour of writing you an account, Madam, of the rencontre with the cruel man who de&s;igned my ruin. The day arrived that he expected would con|&s;ign the trembling victim to his treacherous charge once more. To prevent it, your affectionate Mari|anne was in St. James's Square by nine in the morning, as well as to prepare me for the much dreaded &s;cene, which was to en&s;ue at twelve. We were to be a&s;&s;embled in the drawing-room at eleven, and you may ea&s;ily conceive I was more dead than alive, led into it. Five minutes had &s;carcely e&s;cap&s;ed when

a Sir Thomas Stuart Morell was an|nounced.

I had put on a bonnet with a veil, that whatever change my looks a&s;|&s;umed might not be &s;o readily no|ticed. Sir Thomas, with a familiar &s;mile, began congratulating him&s;elf on the unexpected felicity of &s;eeing me in England; as he approached the &s;mile vani&s;hed, and a look of

<Q>whether I had forgot my old friend, Sir Thomas?</Q>
The Chevalier gave not any of us time to reply, for catching him by the arm ha&s;tily, &s;aid,
<Q>You may take another opportunity of paying your re&s;pects to my &s;i&s;ter, Sir Thomas, &s;he knows I have a me&s;|&s;age of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to you from Mon&s;ieur Houliers, and can readily pa&s;s it over.

I do not repeat this from my own know|ledge of it's having been &s;aid, Ma|dam, but from what your dear niece has &s;ince told me, for &s;eated between her and Mi&s;s O&s;born, it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty I could &s;upport

The Chevalier, and Sir Thomas had been ab&s;ent ten minutes, when the parlour bell was rung, and a &s;ervant &s;ent to &s;ay the favour of my company was de&s;ired by the gentlemen, I aro&s;e, and but for Mr. O&s;born, who immedi|ately offered his hand to lead me down &s;tairs, I mu&s;t have fallen; my legs trembled, and I tottered; &s;trength had nearly for&s;aken me; he &s;aw Sir John's eyes were on me, and &s;aid,

Sir Thomas bowed on my entrance. I bur&s;t in|to tears, he came towards me, and taking one hand while Mr. O&s;born held the other, &s;aid, 'Will you ex|cu&s;e me, Madam?' 'Pardonnez moi, Mon&s;ieur,' interrupted the &s;pright|ly Frenchman, &s;natching it from him:
<Q>no, cur&s;e me if &s;he &s;hall.

She is a charming girl; her vivacity is tinctured with ex|qui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;he would have done the utmo&s;t in her pow|er to &s;erve you. Never yet was &s;he known to turn a deaf ear to the tale of &s;orrow, or di&s;regard the tears of a daughter of affliction; however, talking of what might have been effected is lo&s;ing time; we mu&s;t now turn our thoughts on what is likely to prove mo&s;t advantageous.</Q>
He &s;topt, expect|ing an an&s;wer. Mr. O&s;born and the Chevalier were denied by &s;ur|prize the power of articulation, while I &s;obb'd aloud in giving my gratitude vent. 'Come,' &s;aid he, breaking &s;ilence,

Interrupting him, Mr. O&s;born ha&s;tily &s;aid,
<Q>I thank you, Sir, in my own, and the La|dy's name, for your proffered kind|ne&s;s, but &s;he has a friend above who will hardly allow her to ac|cept it.</Q>

<Q>I am &s;atisfied then. But &s;hould her power be in&s;ufficient, Madam,</Q>
(turning to me,)
<Q>mine may be commanded to add force to it.</Q>
<Q>Oh, Sir Thomas, your goodne&s;s has made bankrupt my gratitude; words are too poor to expre&s;s my &s;en&s;e of &s;uch exce&s;s of friend&s;hip, and I mu&s;t be &s;ilent in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of an inability to

<Q>To effect the &s;ilence which will &s;end us up to the la|dies,</Q>

(at the &s;ame time making an attempt, which Mr. O&s;born pre|vented, to &s;alute me.)
<Q>It is a liber|ty, Frank, &s;aid he, I have never pre&s;umed to take with Mi&s;s Beau|foy, neither will I permit you to make &s;uch an advantage</Q>
<Q>I un|der&s;tand the force of his intention perfectly,</Q>
cried Sir Thomas,
<Q>and I don't think it a bad one, if we re|flect, it's mo&s;t likely the family will wonder at our long ab&s;ence: allow me, Madam,</Q>
(offering his hand) 'to lead you up &s;tairs.' We had hardly got into the drawing-room before a loud rap at the door warned us of our vi&s;itant's approach; my newly acquired friend led me to a &s;eat next Mademoi&s;elle D'Au|bigny, and took him&s;elf the vacant one on the other &s;ide of me. The

&s;ound of foot&s;teps a&s;&s;ured me that another moment would pre&s;ent my greate&s;t enemy to view, and totally uncon&s;cious of either words or ac|tions, I exclaimed, 'Oh &s;hield me, heaven,' and caught fa&s;t hold of the Baronet's arm; the Chevalier imme|diately came acro&s;s the room.
<Q>Let me conjure you,</Q>
(&s;aid he in a half whi&s;per)
<Q>to recollect I am &s;uppo&s;|ed to be your brother; your be|haviour will not only betray your|&s;elf and me, but &s;ubject O&s;born to the reproaches of his family.</Q>
The door opened, unheeding what he had ju&s;t &s;aid, I gave an involun|tary &s;cream; but it proved to be one of the &s;ervants, &s;ent by Stam|ford to &s;ay he begged to &s;peak with Sir John in private: the Chevalier objected to his going down to him, &s;aid him&s;elf alone was empowered to &s;et matters right, and with leave of the company he &s;hould take the liberty of de&s;iring Mr. Stamford to walk up &s;tairs.
<Q>But my dear Che|valier,

con&s;ider, the &s;ight of him will occa&s;ion your &s;i&s;ter &s;o much terror, That door, Sir John, be|longs to a convenient clo&s;et. I &s;hall beg the favour of Sir Thomas to &s;tep in with her, till I require him to bring her forward.</Q>
Happy, you may be a&s;&s;ured, Madam, I was, at any reprieve, though of the &s;hort|e&s;t duration. We ju&s;t entered the clo&s;et as Stamford did the room; and I felt as if I could &s;hrink into nothing at the very &s;ound of his voice. He acco&s;ted Sir John,
<Q>I am &s;orry, Sir, to have occa&s;ion|ed either your&s;elf or family any concern on the bu&s;ine&s;s which I am now come: that</Q>
(continued he, looking around the room, and fixing his eyes on Mr. O&s;born)
<Q>is the man with whom my ward e|loped, and I demand her at his hands.</Q>
Mr. O&s;born reddened, it &s;eems, and told him that if he dared to in&s;i&s;t on having a Lady with whom he had no right, he would
<PB N="128" REF="031198_0126_0FEB50DE26F7C0F8">
lead him out of the hou&s;e by the no&s;e; and not &s;uffering it to re&s;t there, would make a point of po&s;t|ing him in every coffee-hou&s;e about town.
<Q>It is a matter of indiffer|ence to me, Sir, with whom your ward eloped, &s;aid the Chevalier, but I mu&s;t de&s;ire you will be more careful in future of pointing out any relation of mine as a fit object for giving unnece&s;&s;ary unea&s;ine&s;s to, or you will find I am not of &s;uch a placid nature, as tamely to put up with an in&s;ult offered to any part of my family, e&s;pecially where a &s;i&s;ter's &s;afety is endanger|ed, my own honour is more nearly concerned to protect it.</Q>
<Q>Pardon me, Sir,</Q>

<Q>for contradicting the a&s;&s;ertion of mak|ing a claim on your &s;i&s;ter. I have an undoubted right over the lady whom I &s;aw in Sir John's carriage, and will maintain that right, in &s;pite of your's or that gentleman's threats,</Q>

'Don't imagine,' (&s;aid Stamford) looking contemp|tuou&s;ly,
<Q>I am not to be <HI>bullied</HI> out of my right in Mi&s;s Beaufoy. You are deceived, Sir John, in the &s;up|po&s;ition of Mademoi&s;elle Chattel|herhault's being in your hou&s;e; the per&s;on who is here, your &s;on has &s;tolen from me.</Q>
<Q>You certain|ly are deceiving your&s;elf</Q>

<Q>the &s;tory does not ap|pear probable to me, nor will it I fancy gain credit in any court of equity; therefore you mu&s;t excu&s;e me, if I &s;ay your plot &s;hould have been deeper laid to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</Q>
<Q><PB N="130" REF="031198_0128_0FEB50E42D934838">Sdeath, Sir, I &s;corn your mean in|&s;inuation of my laying a plot; however I came not here to con|tend, concluding from your rank that your behaviour would be con&s;i&s;tent with that of a gen|tleman's. I have waited on you, that you may take your choice of re&s;igning the lady quietly, or &s;uf|fering a higher power to wre&s;t her from you.</Q>
<Q>I have no right over her, &s;he has a brother, and I am apt to believe if your eloquence was as fluent as Cicero's, it would hardly prevail on him to re&s;ign her.</Q>
<Q>But that brother, as you plea&s;e to call him, &s;hall be com|pelled to re&s;ign her very &s;hortly.</Q>
<Q>What method will you adopt to oblige him?</Q>
a&s;ked the Chevalier tauntingly.
<Q>Apply to the Chan|cellor,</Q>
replied he,
<Q>and you will find your&s;elf obliged to accede to my claim.</Q>
<Q>On the Chancellor's deci&s;ion the cau&s;e &s;hall re&s;t,</Q>
&s;aid Mr. O&s;born:
<Q>his known integrity
<PB N="131" REF="031198_0129_0FEB50E769EB6E18">
will guide him to pronounce judg|ment again&s;t a ra&s;cal, though he were to gain the fir&s;t intere&s;t in the world to back him in an infamous pro&s;ecution.</Q>
<Q>Take that epithet to your&s;elf,</Q>
&s;aid Stamford,
<Q>it does not belong to me.</Q>
<Q>I have never committed an action that merits it,</Q>
(returned O&s;born,)
<Q>but you wanted not inclination to be guil|ty of that which di&s;graces the man.</Q>
<Q>An altercation in the hear|ing of ladies is pitiful,</Q>
(interrupt|ed the Chevalier)
<Q>we mu&s;t take another opportunity of meeting to &s;ettle the affair.</Q>
<Q>It may be con|cluded immediately, by Sir John's giving Mi&s;s Beaufoy into my care,</Q>
replied Stamford:
<Q>If I harboured Mi&s;s Beaufoy,</Q>
(&s;aid Sir John, an|grily,)
<Q>I could not be &s;urprized at your conduct; but &s;ince I have repeatedly a&s;&s;ured you, that I have never to my knowledge &s;een her, I think your uncommon behavi|our requires an explanation; and
<PB N="132" REF="031198_0130_0FEB50EA98B8B088">
I mu&s;t, and do, in&s;i&s;t on your giv|ing me one before you leave this hou&s;e.</Q>
<Q>Why not &s;uffer the per|&s;on whom you call Chattelher|hault to face me, and what you now call uncommon behaviour, will appear extraordinary no long|er.</Q>
<Q>There is not any nece&s;&s;ity for your &s;eeing her now,</Q>
(&s;aid O&s;|born,)
<Q>neither &s;hall you be allow|ed that &s;atisfaction, till &s;upported by good authority for demanding it. Then I will take care to expo&s;e your villany as it de&s;erves.</Q>
'Don't be &s;o ha&s;ty, Henry' (inter|rupted his father,)
<Q>I &s;ee no impro|priety in the gentleman's being permitted to &s;ee Mademoi&s;elle Chattelherhault; and think the Chevalier cannot have any objec|tion, as it will end the conte&s;t, by convincing him of his error.</Q>
<Q>If you think, Sir John, it will con|vince Mr. Stamford of his error, my permi&s;&s;ion is granted; but he has imbibed the idea &s;o &s;trongly
<PB N="133" REF="031198_0131_0FEB50EF120E6FC0">
of my &s;i&s;ter's being his ward, that I very much que&s;tion if he does not &s;wear more po&s;itively after &s;ee|ing her to what he has had the ef|frontery to affirm already.</Q>
<Q>Im|po&s;&s;ible,</Q>
replied Sir John,
<Q>be|&s;ides, Morell's a&s;&s;ertion mu&s;t have weight, his word has never yet been doubted; nor can it, I tru&s;t, be di&s;puted now. We have ano|ther witne&s;s that certainly will gain credit;</Q>
&s;o &s;aying he came towards to clo&s;et. 'Oh Sir,' I ex|claimed, as the door was about opening,
<Q>I may now conclude my|&s;elf a lo&s;t creature, indeed.</Q>
<Q>Have courage, Madam,</Q>
replied Sir Thomas,
<Q>this bu&s;ine&s;s will termi|nate much better than I expected.</Q>
<Q>Will you be kind enough to bring Mademoi&s;elle Chattelherhault, forward, Sir, and let this unplea|&s;ant affair be put an end to at once,</Q>
&s;aid Sir John, as pulling the door open. In a moment I found my&s;elf in the &s;ame room with
<PB N="134" REF="031198_0132_0FEB50F0A53705F8">
Stamford. Horror thrilled through every vein: in&s;tead of coming to|wards me, as I expected, he looked agha&s;t, for, having ari&s;en and ad|vanced to meet us, at &s;ight of Sir Thomas he retreated a few paces and &s;tood in the attitude of &s;urprize. 'Stuart!' cried he, recovering him|&s;elf, 'How came you here?'
<Q>Op|pre&s;&s;ed innocence demanded my attendance. Mr. Stamford, pain|ful remembrance tells me you were the companion of my youth; this is the fir&s;t time of our meet|ing, &s;ince I embarked years back for India. I did not then expect the next time of &s;eeing you to be obliged to renounce the friend&s;hip you &s;o &s;trongly proffered me.</Q>
<Q>Whatever has been in&s;inuated to injure me in you good opinion is fal&s;e as hell. It is a vile &s;tory trumpt up to glo&s;s over their own conduct, that will not bear a &s;cru|tiny. However, arguing longer is needle&s;s. Had you &s;ent me word

'Hold,' &s;aid Sir Thomas,
<Q>he &s;ays &s;he is my child, Great God! is there truth in the a&s;&s;ertion?</Q>
'Not a word,' &s;aid the Chevalier, (exultingly rubbing his hands for joy,)
<Q>now we may &s;ing Old Ro&s;e and burn the Bellows, as I've heard you Engli&s;h &s;ay. Oh, I<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> diable,</Q>
(exclaimed he altering his tone) 'O&s;born get help.' (For I had fainted in his arms)
<Q>Too &s;ure|ly there is,</Q>
&s;aid Sir Thomas, (un|heeding my in&s;en&s;ibility)&mdash;
<Q>&s;ay, quickly &s;peak. Where is her mo|ther? is &s;he &s;till my wife, or has &s;he forgot &s;he had a hu&s;band? Fool; madman that I was, continued he, &s;tamping his feet, &s;he was inno|cent of my accu&s;ation, and I have
<PB N="136" REF="031198_0134_0FEB50F70A7A9248">
been the murderer of an hone&s;t man. Where is &s;he? But why wi&s;h to add to the mi&s;ery I en|dure, from a knowledge of her abode? Her name is changed, no longer Stuart, but Beaufoy. No wonder my enquiries proved a|bortive. Tell me, yet I dread to hear, is this my own child, of was her mother married again before &s;he was born?</Q>
<Q>Her name is Beaufoy,</Q>
(replied Stamford)
<Q>re|member your's is Stuart.</Q>
<Q>Oh Chri&s;t!</Q>
(exclaimed he &s;triking his hand on his forehead)
<Q>tell me no more; &s;he is incon&s;tant and I re|nounce her. Yet let me know all, proofs will a&s;&s;i&s;t me in tearing her once-loved image from my fond mind. Vainly I flattered my&s;elf, when cheri&s;hing the thought my fortune would atone for the ill u&s;age &s;he had &s;u&s;tained.</Q>
During the whole of this unconnected ad|dre&s;s to Stamford, lady and Mi&s;s O&s;born were &s;triving to recover me,
<PB N="137" REF="031198_0135_0FEB50FB77009CB8">
while Mademoi&s;elle D'Aubigny, eager to learn my doom, could at|tend to no one but the afflicted ba|ronet. The fir&s;t &s;entence I heard pronounced, after gaining my re|collection, was by her.
<Q>Suffer me to entreat, Sir</Q>
(&s;aid &s;he)
<Q>you will not pay any attention to what that vile man &s;ays. The mother of this young lady never had more than one hu&s;band. He went a|broad, and &s;he quitted England, to re&s;ide in France.</Q>
<Q>You have infu&s;ed fre&s;h life, throughout my &s;hattered frame, madam,</Q>
(replied he). 'But why' (&s;peaking with a|vidity)
<Q>commit the care of her child to him?</Q>
<Q>There was no other on the &s;pot to who&s;e care &s;he thought &s;he could entru&s;t her with &s;o much &s;afety.</Q>
<Q>Why place her under any other protection than her own?</Q>
'Oh Sir Thomas,' (re|plied Mademoi&s;elle D'Aubigny) looking mournfully at him&mdash;'What,' (cried he ha&s;tily) 'Is &s;he dead?'

'Oh God,' (finding &s;he forbore to an&s;wer)

<Q>I &s;hall be happy to receive you, Sir; at pre|&s;ent I have bu&s;ine&s;s of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, and mu&s;t bid you good morning.</Q>
O&s;born would have &s;topt him, but was prevented by his father, while the Baronet in an agony of grief, flung him&s;elf in|to a chair, vowing never to know comfort more.
<Q>My dear Chattel|herhault,</Q>

<Q>&s;o I mu&s;t &s;till call you, what my|&s;tery is this? Do for heaven's &s;ake, if the ta&s;k will not be too painful, explain it. Will you believe any thing I &s;hall hereafter advance, Mi&s;s O&s;born, returned I, &s;triving to conceal my half averted face with a handkerchief, after di&s;co|very of my being an impo&s;tor?
<PB N="139" REF="031198_0137_0FEB51006A3EAE98">
You have gained &s;o much on my e&s;teem, that I could not &s;u&s;pect your veracity, though conviction &s;tared me in the face, and be a&s;|&s;ured, whatever is in my power &s;hall not be omitted, in &s;triving to make you happy.</Q>
Sir Thomas, &s;tarting from his &s;eat, came with ha&s;ty &s;trides towards me.
<Q>Why if you really are my daughter, did you &s;ubmit to exchange the anti|ent name of Stuart, for that of Beaufoy?</Q>
<Q>That que&s;tion, Sir, re|minds me I mu&s;t not be too &s;an|guine: Dare I flatter my&s;elf in the illu&s;ive hope of your being my father, when your's is called Mo|rell?</Q>
<Q>It is not Morell, neither had I
&s;uffered that name &s;hould take place of mine, but for an e&s;tate, which I fondly intended to make your mother's life ea&s;y with. Imagine not, that I have totally renounced it. No, the name of Stuart I pride my&s;elf more in than the empty title, annexed

<P>BEFORE I conclude my narra|tive, Madam, I cannot refrain from telling you, that however ridicu|lous Sir Thomas's pride of family may appear to tho&s;e who have not to boa&s;t of their alliance with one, I mu&s;t own, I have my life through inherited, in &s;ome degree, his di&s;|po&s;ition. I have felt it eminently when a child, if cha&s;tifed by tho&s;e I conceived my inferiors, though hardly knowing what the pride of family-ance&s;try meant, and my &s;ta|tion in life degraded at the &s;ame time. As I increa&s;ed in years, my mind became more enlightened. I con&s;idered every per&s;on endued with merit my more than equal; but if treated with impunity, by tho&s;e who were my &s;uperiors in point of fortune alone, my &s;pirit
<PB N="142" REF="031198_0140_0FEB510980DE7150">
could not brook it, neither could I forbear reflecting at the moment, that the great grandfathers of tho&s;e very people were mo&s;t likely beg|ging their bread, while mine were moving in all the &s;plendour of afflu|ence. The painful idea has wounded my feelings to an exce&s;s&mdash;when a ray of con&s;olation darting on my mind has di&s;pelled the gloom and rai&s;ed my &s;oul &s;uperior to low ma|lice. I have triumphed in an inward &s;elf-a&s;&s;urance, that time would rai&s;e me infinitely above their level; the time is now arrived. The claims of &s;ociety demand my civility to|wards tho&s;e people; but friend|&s;hip's &s;acred tie di&s;owns them all. You will readily excu&s;e the hauteur that appears to guide the preced|ing lines, they are written feeling|ly; I have been repeatedly ill treat|ed, by the very people who profe&s;t mo&s;t friend&s;hip for me; yet if I know my own heart, it will never permit the actuation (if I may be

I have &s;urely &s;aid enough, Madam, to tire you with ob&s;ervation; now proceed to dia|logue. In an&s;wer to Sir Thomas's reflection on my mother for chang|ing her name, I told him,
<Q>that de|&s;erted by her friends, &s;he had on|ly a trifling pittance to &s;upport her&s;elf, and con&s;idered a very &s;hort time might render her a mo|ther, former rank could not be &s;upported; &s;he therefore deter|mined that the family of Stuart &s;hould not be wittingly in&s;ulted by an unfeeling world in her; and renounced the name.

Rea&s;on for&s;ook my brea&s;t a whole twelve-month; at length returned; yes, cruelly returned, with double force, to awaken me to an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e of complicated mi&s;ery. So &s;he is really dead? Be&s;t of women, ejaculated he, your life I rendered wretched; to your memory I will be ju&s;t. Such meek forbearance to vindicate your conduct demands the tribute.

His la&s;t &s;peech, delivered mourn fully, af|fected me, if po&s;&s;ible, more than the former ones. I could make no reply: taking my &s;ilence for a mark of di&s;gu&s;t, he cried, pu&s;hing me from him.
<Q>Go, I find you hate me, you may from former beha|viour have &s;ufficient cau&s;e for it, but I will not tamely &s;ubmit to receiving contempt from you; though con&s;cious of having me|rited it.</Q>

'Leave me, quickly' replied my father,

O&s;born and the Chevalier &s;upported me down &s;tairs, where I acquainted the family with the occa|&s;ion of my mother's unfortunate lo&s;s of happine&s;s. Luckily I am po&s;&s;e&s;t of a letter which my father &s;ent her the day of taking his departure: hap|pening to be looking over a &s;mall ca&s;ket of her's the preceding even|ing, that I had not till then opened, I found it tied with a piece of black &s;ilk twi&s;t, to which was &s;u&s;pended a &s;mall parcel; on opening it, I found a pair of diamond ear-rings. On the paper was written:
<Q>The&s;e were the la&s;t ornaments Mr. Stuart purcha&s;ed for me; all my other appendages to dre&s;s I have long &s;ince di&s;po&s;ed of; but determined

to pre&s;erve the&s;e, (unle&s;s my child was de&s;titute of the nece&s;&s;aries of life) as reliques of his affection for an ungrateful woman.</Q>
I gave Lady O&s;born the letter to peru&s;e, and through it have confirmed my|&s;elf the daughter of Sir Thomas. Mi&s;s O&s;born was in raptures with her brother, for a&s;&s;uming &s;o proper a &s;pirit at Dover. Sir John &s;aid,
<Q>As it had turned out, there was no harm done; but he hoped Hen|ry would be more careful in fu|ture. I might have borne the mo&s;t infamous character for any thing he knew to the contrary; he had only my own word for what I had advanced; and it was two to one, if every &s;yllable had not prov|ed fal&s;e.</Q>
'Well, well,' &s;aid Mi&s;s O&s;born, in a lively tone,
<Q>you find it has not proved fal&s;e, my dear Sir. I think in&s;tead of rebuking Henry for what is pa&s;t, you ought to thank your &s;tars on your knees, night and morning, for be&s;towing

&s;uch a kind hearted fellow of a &s;on on you; for my own part, I &s;hall certainly think the better of him all my life to come. Hone&s;tly &s;peaking, Sir John,</Q> continued &s;he drily.
<Q>Do you really think you de&s;erve him?</Q>
Immediately al|tering her tone to a fearful one,

<Q>However I have &s;poilt you my&s;elf by too much encouragement, and cannot blame any other per&s;on for it.</Q>
'Ah, Sir,' (in a tone of raillery)
<Q>too late you find the fatal effects of not checking young &s;aucebox in her infancy. But what do you &s;ay now, to be&s;towing me on &s;ome hone&s;t John Trot kind of a man, who will give me all my own way,

<Q>what do you mean? How can you talk &s;o? You do not con&s;ider whom you are talking before.</Q>

My father coming in, put an end to the conver&s;ation and relieved my embarra&s;&s;ment: &s;oon after the family agreed they would not be interrupted by vi&s;i|tants, and gave orders to be denied to whoever called on them that day.

<P>Surprize, and ec&s;tacy united, have nearly deprived me of the little rea|&s;on I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.

Well; but the &s;ecret, lord I had almo&s;t forgotten that, though my heart, my head, my thoughts, all, all, are full of the &s;ubject.

in&s;olent manner you ever heard of. You will &s;carcely credit, that &s;o flighty a toad as Sir John frequently calls me, could ever be won by the man who took pains to convince her he was not blind to her faults. Ah, you may &s;tare! It is ab&s;olutely true. I have been flattered by one, treated with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive re&s;pect by another, while a third more impe|tuous than either of the others, has dared to be jealous of the very peo|ple I de&s;pi&s;ed; but not one, except Hamilton, pre&s;umed to &s;ay that I inherited the foibles of the whole of my &s;ex.

Love, he had never &s;o much as &s;poken of to me; yet the attention he paid me,
<PB N="158" REF="031198_0156_0FEB513B473B5180">
was remarked by all my acquaint|ance. At this period his uncle died, and he became the Marquis of D&mdash; his vi&s;its from being fre|quent, were withdrawn on a &s;ud|den; if by chance we met, a cool|ne&s;s that pierced my &s;oul was &s;ub&s;ti|tuted for the warmth of friend&s;hip I had been accu&s;tomed to experi|ence. Hurt&mdash;beyond de&s;cription hurt, at a change of conduct I had not wittingly given any occa&s;ion for, I determined his image &s;hould be era&s;ed from my mind though it co&s;t me my life accompli&s;hing. In this &s;tate of mind I continued when Grenvill's fir&s;t vi&s;it was permitted; he was &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to a degree. I &s;trove to regard him in the light of one who was de&s;tined for my hu&s;|band. It availed me little, and him &s;till le&s;s: my heart would not &s;uf|fer the le&s;&s;on of affection to take root in my mind, for a character &s;o oppo&s;ite to that it had acknow|ledged for it's lord, and when he

He expo&s;tulated; but my heart was now too firmly at|tached to it's fir&s;t choice to &s;uffer whatever he could urge to prevail. His di&s;mi&s;&s;ion was the con&s;equence; &s;ince that, how often has my pride been piqued and love wounded, by the Marquis's treatment of me at the hou&s;es of different friends where we have met. I have witne&s;&s;ed his polite attention to every other fe|male in company, while I alone was neglected; or received the di&s;|tant civility due to an utter &s;tranger. In&s;tead of &s;uffering a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits to become vi&s;ible at tho&s;e times, as a &s;erious &s;oul like your|&s;elf would have done, I have con|quered my feelings in &s;ome degree, and to &s;upport a &s;hew of equal in|difference have coquetted with ev|ery other man in company; but this gaiete was forced, and generally

The rea&s;on he gives for the affected in|difference I pen with plea&s;ure, be|cau&s;e it is an a&s;&s;urance that his heart was incapable of change, as my own was of being alienated. His mother wi&s;hed him to marry la|dy Sarah Gibbons; to oblige her, he owns he did his utmo&s;t in &s;triving to e&s;trange his affections. It is well for me though the trial failed of ef|fect; and the behaviour I lamented in &s;ecret was merely an effort to comply with her wi&s;h. Hang lady Sarah, I was going to &s;ay, &s;he has
