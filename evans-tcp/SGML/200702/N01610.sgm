<BIBL>Joh. II. 17.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The Zeal of thy Hou&s;e hath Eaten me up.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE are at this time concerned with a people profe&s;&s;ing a <HI>Zeal for the Hou&s;e of God</HI> that has <HI>Eaten up</HI> a Little part of their E&s;tates, which they have devoted unto the Building of the <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> wherein We are now A&s;&s;embled be|fore Him. Our concern with them, is not only to a&s;&s;ure them, that what the <HI>Zeal</HI> has <HI>Eaten up,</HI> will not be Lo&s;t, but al&s;o to remind them of o|ther and further Operations, where|in their <HI>Zeal</HI> is to be demon&s;trated: That &s;o their <HI>Zeal for the Hou&s;e of
<PB N="4" REF="001913_0004_0FB9D5EBD5146878">
God,</HI> may be uniform, and be univer|&s;al, &amp; be ju&s;tified. <HI>Hearken, my Be|loved Brethren.</HI> I do now &s;ome|thing more than fetch a <HI>Red hot Stone</HI> from the <HI>Altar,</HI> for this pur|po&s;e, to keep alive the <HI>Flame</HI> of your <HI>Zeal:</HI> I bring the pattern of our admirable SAVIOUR, Even, <HI>our God, who is a con&s;uming Fire.</HI> When the P&s;almi&s;t, who is Renowned in all Ages for the <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e of God,</HI> which was flaming in him, gave this Account of him&s;elf, <HI>The Zeal of thy Hou&s;e hath Eaten me up,</HI> we may &s;ay, <HI>I pray thee, of whom &s;pake the P&s;almi&s;t this? Of him&s;elf, or of &s;ome other Man?</HI> The An&s;wer mu&s;t be, He was a Type of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> in what he <HI>Spake.</HI> It was foretold of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> That <HI>the Lord &s;hould come into His Temple, and act as a Refiner there.</HI> Our SA|VIOUR coming into the <HI>Temple,</HI> and purging the <HI>Temple</HI> of the <HI>Mo|ney-changers</HI> there, would have drawn the minds of the People unto the
<PB N="5" REF="001913_0005_0FB9D5EE1C7FFD70">
Con&s;ideration of that famous Pro|phecy. Whether it had this Effect or no, the minds of His Di&s;ciples, were drawn to con&s;ider <HI>another</HI> Pro|phecy; and what was to be found in the <HI>Sixty ninth P&s;alm</HI> concerning Him. Every <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> was to pay <HI>half a Shekel</HI> yearly to the &s;ervice of the <HI>Temple.</HI> When any Man brought a <HI>Shekel,</HI> to change for Two <HI>Half-Shekels,</HI> there was a <HI>profit</HI> Exacted by the <HI>changer:</HI> And when the <HI>Shekel</HI> was brought for Two, there was a <HI>Double</HI> profit Exacted for the change. The like <HI>unlawful gains</HI> were made by &s;elling of Cattle for the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> there. Our SAVIOUR having His Holy Soul, inflamed with a ju&s;t <HI>Zeal,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Di&s;honesties</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;i|ons</HI> committed by the&s;e <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Harpies,</HI> appears with a <HI>Scourge</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;mall Cords in His Hand, threatning of them, and the guilty Thieves fled before Him: GOD in our SAVI|OUR Struck them with &s;uch a dread, that they could not &s;tand be|fore Him.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001913_0006_0FB9D5F02EBFD1B8">
The <HI>Zeal</HI> which our SAVIOUR Exerted on this Occa&s;ion, made His Di&s;ciples, to remember the De&s;cripti|on which the Holy SPIRIT had a|bove a Thou&s;and years before given of Him; in this pa&s;&s;age, <HI>The Zeal of thy Hou&s;e hath Eaten me up.</HI> I hope you ob&s;erve, That they who atten|tively Read the Word of God, will have the advantage from it; A Profitable and a Comfortable <HI>Re|membrance</HI> of what they have Read. Agreeable pa&s;&s;ages of what they have Read, will be Occa&s;ionally <HI>Remembred</HI> with them. You al&s;o ob&s;erve; That all the Characters of the promi&s;ed REDEEMER, given in the <HI>Ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> are an&s;wered in our Ble&s;|&s;ed JESUS. Nothing was Prophe&s;i|ed concerning the REDEEMER to come, which we don't find an&s;wered in our Lovely JESUS.</P>
<P>But the principal Thing to be now ob&s;erved is this.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001913_0007_0FB9D5F570168FE8">
The Zeal of the Hou&s;e of GOD, will mightily po&s;&s;e&s;s them, who have an Heart after the Heart of GOD.</P>
<P>A <HI>David,</HI> who was a <HI>Man after the Heart of GOD,</HI> was one that could &s;ay, <HI>The Zeal of thy Hou&s;e hath Eaten me up.</HI> The Antitype of <HI>David,</HI> and the Man who was GOD as well as Man, and had an <HI>Heart</HI> the mo&s;t <HI>after the Heart of GOD,</HI> that ever was in the World, could much more &s;ay, <HI>The Zeal of thy Hou&s;e ha's Eaten me up.</HI> Such a <HI>Zeal</HI> mu&s;t be in every One, who would have his <HI>Heart</HI> found <HI>after the Heart of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>We will Enquire, fir&s;t. What is meant by <HI>Zeal</HI> in General?</P>
<P>To this the An&s;wer is; That <HI>Zeal</HI> is an Affection to the <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> of God in an <HI>Inten&s;e De|gree. Zelus e&s;t Inten&s;us Gradus affecti|onis.</HI> Every Good Man has his <HI>Af|fections,</HI> towards God and the Things that plea&s;e Him. Now, as the
<PB N="8" REF="001913_0008_0FB9D5F779B22058">
Word <HI>ZELE,</HI> comes from a Theme, that Signifies, <HI>To be Boiling hot;</HI> So, When our well-placed <HI>Affections,</HI> are <HI>Boiling Hot,</HI> or, when we are, what we read, Rom. XI. 11. <HI>Fer|vent in Spirit, Serving the Lord,</HI> then have we a <HI>Zeal of GOD.</HI> In <HI>Zeal,</HI> there is fir&s;t, a <HI>Love</HI> to GOD: and a very Inten&s;e <HI>Love,</HI> But then this <HI>Love</HI> mu&s;t operate in a <HI>Sorrow</HI> for, and an <HI>Anger</HI> at what is di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD; An <HI>Indignation</HI> again&s;t Every Thing, that is a <HI>Provocation</HI> to GOD. <HI>Zeal</HI> is a Compo&s;ition of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Grief,</HI> and <HI>Wrath:</HI> an Holy mixture of all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, belongs unto it.</P>
<P>We will Enquire; Secondly, What is meant, by being <HI>Eaten up</HI> with <HI>Zeal?</HI></P>
<P>To this the An&s;wer is; Be&s;ure it intends, that the <HI>Zeal</HI> does <HI>mightily po&s;&s;e&s;s</HI> them in whom it is. Then does the <HI>Zeal</HI> of a Man <HI>Eat him up,</HI> when it makes an <HI>Entire oblation</HI> of his All unto GOD. The <HI>Fire</HI> did
<PB N="9" REF="001913_0009_0FB9D5F88B6C3D78">
<HI>Eat up,</HI> what was upon the <HI>Altar.</HI> An Holy Man, does that thing, Rom. XII. 1. <HI>Pre&s;ent your &s;elves unto GOD.</HI> He laies his <HI>All</HI> as on the <HI>Altar</HI> before the Lord, and <HI>Zeal</HI> comes like a <HI>Fire,</HI> &s;o to con&s;ume it all, that GOD only &s;hall have the <HI>Re|gards</HI> of all, the <HI>U&s;es</HI> of all. The <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> of GOD, mu&s;t Engro&s;s all our <HI>Faculties;</HI> mu&s;t em|ploy all our <HI>Thoughts,</HI> all our <HI>Time,</HI> all our <HI>Strength.</HI> We are to <HI>Love the Lord our God with all our Heart;</HI> And the Intere&s;ts of GOD mu&s;t <HI>Swallow up</HI> all our Intere&s;ts. Then the <HI>Zeal of GOD</HI> has <HI>Eaten us up.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Our Main Enquiry is, <HI>What is the Zeal of the HOUSE of GOD, which is mightily to po&s;&s;e&s;s us!</HI> or, How are we to demon&s;trate our &s;elves <HI>mightily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> with the ZEAL of the HOUSE of GOD? You &s;hall have the An&s;wer to this, in the&s;e Articles.</P>
<P>I. We are to be <HI>Zealou&s;ly Concerned,</HI> that we may Enjoy the <HI>Church</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="001913_0010_0FB9D5FBA123A868">
our SAVIOUR, and have the Enjoy|ment of all the <HI>Ordinances,</HI> which are in the Church admini&s;tred unto them who wait upon Him. What is the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD? We are told; 1 Tim. III. 15. <HI>The Hou&s;e of GOD is the Church of the Living GOD.</HI> There mu&s;t be awakened in us a <HI>Zealous Con|cern,</HI> to have the <HI>Church-State</HI> of the Go&s;pel, Erected, Pre&s;erved, Suppor|ted among us. The <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e of GOD</HI> is defective in us, if we delay to come into the <HI>Church-State</HI> of the Go&s;pel, and to join unto the Societies that a&s;&s;ociate for the Wor&s;hip of GOD our SAVIOUR. That &s;uch a <HI>Church-State</HI> may be car|ried on, we &s;hould be willing to lay out what &s;hould be Nece&s;&s;ary. It mu&s;t be <HI>nouri&s;hed</HI> with what we have: El&s;e we cannot &s;ay, That the <HI>Zeal</HI> of it has <HI>Eaten us up.</HI> A Servant of GOD, was at much Expence, that &s;o the Wor&s;hip of GOD, might be maintained. It was He, who &s;aid, <HI>The Zeal of thy Hou&s;e hath Eaten me
<PB N="11" REF="001913_0011_0FB9D5FDD6C42BB8">
up.</HI> And for this cau&s;e he al&s;o &s;aid, 1 Chron. XXIX. 3. <HI>I have &s;et my Affection to the Hou&s;e of my GOD.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD, His <HI>Ordi|nances</HI> are di&s;pen&s;ed. The <HI>Zeal</HI> of that <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> mu&s;t make us prize our <HI>Opportunities</HI> to be partakers of the&s;e <HI>Ordinances.</HI> We mu&s;t be <HI>Glad,</HI> when we have <HI>Opportunities</HI> to draw near unto GOD in His <HI>Hou&s;e;</HI> and at|tend upon the Exerci&s;es wherein GOD is to be there met withal. This was the <HI>Zeal</HI> of old &s;o Expre&s;s'd; P&s;al. CXXII. 1. <HI>I was glad, when they &s;aid unto me, Let us go into the Hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI> We mu&s;t be <HI>Sad,</HI> when we are depriv'd of, debarr'd from, <HI>Opportunities,</HI> to meet with GOD in His <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> and there have <HI>our Fel|low&s;hip with the Father, and with His Son Je&s;us Christ.</HI> So was the <HI>Zeal</HI> Expre&s;s'd of Old; P&s;al. CXLII. 4. <HI>When I remember the&s;e things, I pour out my Soul in me; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the Hou&s;e of GOD.</HI> Such ought our
<PB N="12" REF="001913_0012_0FB9D6016EDF2D10">
<HI>Zeal</HI> to be for the <HI>Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD, that we &s;hould think much of <HI>no pains</HI> to come unto it. We &s;hould have &s;uch a Value for what is to be done, and heard, and had in the <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> of the Faithful, that we &s;hould begrutch no Labour, no Travel, for coming at them. A &s;mall matter &s;hould not be made our Excu&s;e for not Coming at them. We &s;hould e&s;teem an <HI>Hour</HI> there, to be <HI>better than a thou&s;and el&s;ewhere.</HI> Our E&s;teem for what is to be found there, &s;hould <HI>overcome</HI> all the <HI>Diffi|culties</HI> of Coming thither. Then does the <HI>Zeal</HI> of the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> indeed <HI>Eat us up,</HI> when no Difficulties in the Way can &s;tand before it. The <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e of GOD,</HI> will Ena|ble a Man to &s;ay with him, P&s;al. XXVI. 8. <HI>I have Loved the Habitati|on of thy Hou&s;e.</HI> It will make a man Delight in &s;uch Devotions as are performed at the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD. It will give him a Delight in <HI>praying</HI> to GOD, in <HI>Hearing</HI> from GOD, in
<PB N="13" REF="001913_0013_0FB9D603478D1B00">
<HI>Prai&s;ing</HI> of GOD, in &s;itting at the <HI>Holy Table,</HI> and in ob&s;erving all that our Lord has required there. And a <HI>Zeal for the Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD, will be accompanied with a <HI>Zeal for the Day</HI> of GOD: The <HI>Lords&punc; Day,</HI> which is a Day Principally &s;et apart for the&s;e Devotions. 'Tis a welcome Day to a Man, who has the <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD <HI>Eating</HI> him up. The <HI>Sab|bath</HI> is a Delight unto him. When the <HI>Ordinances</HI> in the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of our SAVIOUR, are more to us, than our <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary Food,</HI> and our Souls feed up|on them, then the Zeal of His Hou&s;e hath <HI>Eaten us up.</HI></P>
<P>II. We &s;hould be <HI>Zealou&s;ly Con|cerned,</HI> that the <HI>Church</HI> of our SAVI|OUR may be purified from all <HI>Cor|ruptions,</HI> and nothing that will <HI>Corrupt Religion</HI> may be remaining there. When was it, that our Saviour &s;aid, <HI>The Zeal of thy Hou&s;e hath Eaten me up:</HI> It was when He was cha&s;ing out of the <HI>Temple,</HI> the Corruptions which had crept into it. There is
<PB N="14" REF="001913_0014_0FB9D605F09A3320">
now in the Minds of Men, a Natural Tendency to <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Folly.</HI> The <HI>Spirit which works in the Children of Di&s;obedience,</HI> improves the Tendency with a Cur&s;ed <HI>Efficacy.</HI> Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that Things Abomi|nable to the Holy GOD, Speedily and Ea&s;ily get into His <HI>Hou&s;e:</HI> The <HI>Church</HI> of GOD can't continue long undefiled; but <HI>Roots of Bitterne&s;s</HI> are continually &s;pringing up in it, where|by <HI>many are defiled.</HI> Now, we mu&s;t have in us a <HI>Zealous Concern,</HI> to &s;ee the Church re&s;cued from the <HI>Abo|minations</HI> which the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> or the <HI>Sin of Man, </HI> has introduced into it. The <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD, is very notably to be employ'd on that work; Dan. VIII. 14. <HI>The Sanctuary &s;hall be clean&s;ed. Zealous Reformers</HI> are they that have the <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e of GOD</HI> acting of them.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t have a <HI>Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Re|formation</HI> of Abu&s;es that are got into the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD, and pro&s;ecute the <HI>Reformation</HI> with a <HI>Vigour</HI> in our

Application to it; with a <HI>Venture</HI> of our All for the Accompli&s;hment of it. When the <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e of GOD,</HI> was burning in the Soul of <HI>Elijah,</HI> he could &s;ay, 1 Kings XIX. 10. <HI>I have been very Jealous for the Lord of Ho&s;ts; for the Children of I&s;rael have for&s;aken thy Covenant, and thrown down thine Altars.</HI> The <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e of</HI> GOD mu&s;t make us Indu&s;trious to re&s;tore and pre&s;erve <HI>Sound Doctrine</HI> there. We mu&s;t Vin|dicate the <HI>Truth,</HI> and Suppre&s;s <HI>Here|&s;ies</HI> by u&s;ing all proper Methods of Conviction upon them. Our Zeal is thus called for; Jude 3. <HI>Earne&s;tly contend for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints. Go&s;pel Truths</HI> mu&s;t be precious to us. We are to <HI>buy the Truth</HI> at any rate, but <HI>&s;ell it</HI> at no rate in the World. We are to be <HI>Valiant for the Truth upon Earth;</HI> And &s;trive to an Agony rather than part with it, and &s;pend All in the Defence of it, and &s;uffer any Death rather than <HI>Deny</HI> it. The <HI>Liberties</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001913_0016_0FB9D612126463A8">
of the <HI>Church</HI> are to be livelily de|clared for, livelily adher'd to. We are to <HI>Stand fa&s;t</HI> in them. If any make unju&s;t Inva&s;ions on them, we are to with&s;tand the <HI>Invaders.</HI> The <HI>Zeal of the Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD mu&s;t make us do our part, that the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of GOD may be there managed, only according to the <HI>Divine Appointments,</HI> and not be polluted with <HI>Humane In|ventions.</HI> Our <HI>Zeal</HI> mu&s;t Signalize our Di&s;like of that Iniquity; Mat.

The <HI>Zeal</HI> of the Great GOD Him&s;elf is peculiarly di&s;play'd, in the matters of the <HI>Se|cond Commandment.</HI> And our <HI>Zeal</HI> mu&s;t make us thoughtful, that the <HI>Images</HI> may not be brought unto the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of GOD, which may Violate His <HI>Holy Commandment</HI> there. Once

<P>It's probable that this latter part of our Text, does more immediately and directly intend, that the Lord Je&s;us would bring upon <HI>Jezebel</HI> &amp; her wick|ed followers, &s;uch <HI>remarkable de&s;truct|ive Judgments</HI> for their wicked works; as &s;hould <HI>demon&s;trate to all the Church|es</HI> that heard of them, <HI>that he knew their hearts. Jezebel</HI> pretended to be a <HI>Prophete&s;s,</HI> extraordinarily In&s;pired and taught of God, tho' indeed &s;he was not. So, calling her &s;elf a <HI>Pro|phete&s;s,</HI> &s;he pretended that her <HI>Doct|rines were Divine;</HI> and might very likely in&s;inuate, that 'twas but a part of <HI>Chri&s;tian Liberty</HI> to practice &s;uch <HI>Fornication</HI> and <HI>Idolatry,</HI> as &s;he incou|couraged.

<PB N="17" REF="001913_0062_0FB9D6A45546C318">
Judgments therefor, as &s;hould <HI>fully con|vince the Churches</HI> (for their awaken|ing, warning, caution) that he knew the <HI>wickedne&s;s of their hearts,</HI> and was righteous in the Judgments he inflict|ed for their Crimes. God &s;ometimes executes &s;uch remarkable vengeance on the wicked, that a man &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>Veri|ly he is a God that Judgeth in the earth.

It's un&s;peakably dangerous for Per&s;ons or Churches, to provoke the Lord Je&s;us by acting contrary to his Word; for he can <HI>remove the can|dle&s;tick</HI> out of it's place, <HI>fight against them with the rod of his mouth, come on them</HI> (&s;uddenly) <HI>as a thief, kill them with death,</HI> and <HI>&s;pue them out of his mouth</HI> (as he threatens in ca&s;e of Im|penitence and non amendment) Rev. 2. 5, 16, 23. <HI>and</HI> 3. 3, 16. If they provoke him to anger, he can tear them to pieces &s;o that none &s;hall deli|ver them; he can terribly plague and puni&s;h them both in this World and in the next. On the other hand, if

they keep the word of Chri&s;t's pati|ence, uphold and maintain his <HI>Doc|trine, Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline</HI> as his word directs; and in all things approve them&s;elves to him; he can and will do for them, all that infinite Wi&s;dom (accompani'd with Infinite Love) &s;ees be&s;t for them. What great and <HI>precious Promi&s;es</HI> in the&s;e Epi&s;tles to the <HI>A&s;ian Churches,</HI> are there made to tho&s;e that are faithful in &s;erving of Chri&s;t?

<P>And as all particular Churches, &s;hould make Gods glory their end and his Word their rule; &s;o &s;hould <HI>you</HI> who purpo&s;e (God willing) to attend and uphold his Wor&s;hip and Ordi|nances <HI>in this place.</HI> To you there|fore that have been at con&s;iderable pains and co&s;t, in building this Hou&s;e
<PB N="27" REF="001913_0072_0FB9D6D9EF9194F0">
for the Wor&s;hip of God, I would &s;ay a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Examine your &s;elves concerning what you have done in this matter.</HI> Was it with a true and hearty aim, at the furtherance of Gods glory and the In|tere&s;t of Religion; that you engag'd in this affair, and have been at &s;uch pains and expence in it? I would not be mi&s;taken, I do not charge nor chal|lenge any of you in this matter; how|ever I think it's not improper, for you to examine your own hearts in this affair. If upon examination you find, that you have regularly and &s;incerely approv'd your hearts to God in this affair; then be <HI>thankful</HI> that God has enabled you to <HI>expend &s;o much</HI> for his &s;ervice, and that he has <HI>Inclin'd</HI> you thus to <HI>honour him with your Sub&s;tance;</HI> and you &s;hould humbly hope and tru&s;t, that the&s;e your gifts and offer|ings do and &s;hall find acceptance with God thro' Chri&s;t. It's a good and great thing, when in matters of this nature per&s;ons can truly &s;ay, as <HI>David</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="001913_0073_0FB9D6DAF0EE0040">
about his <HI>Preparations</HI> to build the <HI>Temple,</HI> 1 Chron. 29. 17.&mdash;<HI>As for me, in the uprightne&s;s of mine heart I have willingly offered all the&s;e things.</HI> And as you &s;hould be <HI>thankful,</HI> &s;o far as you have <HI>approv'd your &s;elves to God</HI> in this affair; &s;o you &s;hould be <HI>thank|ful</HI> al&s;o for the <HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> you have had. The be&s;t means can't command &s;uc|ce&s;s, Eccl. 9. 11. <HI>The race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong, neither yet bread to the wi&s;e, nor riches to men of under&s;tanding, nor favour to men of skill: but time and chance happeneth to all men.</HI> Men might labour in the fire, and &s;pend their &s;trength for very vanity, if God did not &s;mile on and &s;ucceed their Endeavours, P&s;al. 127. 1. <HI>Except the Lord build the Hou&s;e, they labour in vain that build it.</HI> It is therefore owing to kind Providence, not only that per&s;ons have <HI>contributed</HI> of their <HI>e&s;tates to build this Hou&s;e;</HI> but al&s;o that <HI>Materials</HI> have been provi|ded, <HI>Labourers</HI> and <HI>Artificers pre&s;erved and a&s;&s;i&s;ted,</HI> and <HI>that the Hou&s;e is thus

fini&s;hed and perfected. Be thankful</HI> to God for this. But if upon examina|tion any of you find, that you have acted from <HI>by, &s;ini&s;ter</HI> ends, not truly aiming at the furtherance of Gods glory and the Intere&s;t of Religion, or not <HI>chiefly</HI> aiming at the&s;e things; this calls for your humiliation before God, and flying to the blood of Je&s;us for pardon.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Approve your &s;elves to God for the future.</HI> Be Chri&s;tians not only in word, but in deed and in truth, Dont content your &s;elves, with any thing &s;hort of true unfeign'd repen|tance of &s;in, and faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. A <HI>New Meeting-Huu&s;e</HI> (if it were as co&s;tly and magnificent as <HI>Solomons Temple</HI>) <HI>New Seats, New Pews,</HI> with|out a <HI>New Heart;</HI> can never Intitle you to an <HI>habitation</HI> or <HI>&s;eat</HI> in the <HI>New Jeru&s;alem</HI> which is above. <HI>Sabbaths, Meeting-Hou&s;es, Ordinances, Mini&s;ters;</HI> as to <HI>Man's profit,</HI> are all of them ap|pointed to this end <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to <HI>bring Souls nearer to God in Christ, and make them

more meet for glory.</HI> If you content your &s;elves with externals in Reli|gion, without having your hearts &s;in|cere and upright with God; then you &s;atisfy your &s;elves meerly with <HI>means,</HI> neglecting the <HI>end,</HI> they were appointed for; and thus to do, would be great folly and wickedne&s;s indeed. Live therefore as becomes the Chil|dren of God, the members of Chri&s;t, the living Temples of the Holy Spi|rit; being holy in heart and life, holy in all manner of conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Maintain Religion in your Fami|lies.</HI> Be religious in your own hou|&s;es, as well as in the Hou&s;e of God. Maintain a con&s;tant cour&s;e of <HI>&s;ecret Prayer,</HI> Mat. 6. 6. <HI>Enter into thy clo&s;et, and when thou hast &s;hut the door, pray to thy Father which is in &s;ecret; and thy Father which &s;eeth in &s;ecret &s;hall reward thee openly.</HI> Maintain a con&s;tant cour&s;e of <HI>Family-Prayer</HI> every <HI>morn|ing and evening.</HI> Re&s;olve as <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> of old, Jo&s;h. 24. 15. <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI> Let
