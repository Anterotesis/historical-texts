<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Bo&s;ton, January 21, 1768.</HEAD>
<P>I Found it nece&s;&s;ary to call the A&s;&s;embly &s;ooner than I intended, and they accordingly met on December 30th. I deferred giving your Lord&s;hip any Account of their Proceedings till they &s;hould become intere&s;ting enough to de&s;erve your Lord&s;hip's Notice. The fir&s;t 18 Days were &s;pent in preparing Remon&s;trances again&s;t the Act for impo&s;ing new Duties, and directing the Application of them for the Support of the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice &amp; the Govern|ment. A few Days before the Meeting of the A&s;&s;embly the Speaker of the Hou&s;e was with me, and in the Cour&s;e of Conver&s;ation informed me that it was intended to remon|&s;trate again&s;t the late Acts, and a&s;ked my Opinion upon it. I told him that if they were determined upon that Step, I would advi&s;e them to do it in &s;uch a Manner that the Terms of their Remon&s;trance might not nece&s;&s;arily come before Parliament; for I knew that however cautiou&s;ly it might be worded, it could not be free from a Claim of a Right to an Exemption from Acts of this kind, and I was well a&s;&s;ured that however favourable the Parliament had been to them heretofore, it was at pre&s;ent by no Means di&s;po&s;ed to bear with a farther Di&s;pute of their Authority &s;o &s;oon after it had been &s;o &s;olemnly declared to be inherent in them, and e&s;pecially in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, which was of Port Duties which had heretofore been admitted to belong to Parliament, and now were to be taken away by a Refinement which however it might read in American News-Papers, would never be heard in the two Hou&s;es; which allowed of no Di&s;tinctions in what they &s;hould think fit to enact for Ame|rica. I added, that if they &s;hould think proper to addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty's Secretary of State upon this Occa&s;ion, it was my official Bu&s;ine&s;s to take the Charge of it, and I &s;hould
<PB N="4" REF="011176_0003_0F862BCEDBDE2F90">
faithfully remit it, whatever the Contents were; and if they put it into other Hands, I &s;hould remon&s;trate again&s;t it as being irregular and uncon&s;titutional for any Addre&s;&s;es to pa&s;s from an A&s;&s;embly (where the King has a Repre&s;entative pre&s;iding) to his Maje&s;ty, either directly or indirectly, except thro' the Mediation of his Repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the A&s;&s;embly met, the Hou&s;e ordered the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms, which was regi&s;tered in the Secretary's Office, to be brought in and read, and then appointed a Committee to con&s;ider the State of the Province and report. This Committee reported a Letter to Mr. DeBerdt their Agent, and another to your Lord&s;hip: the&s;e being very long, they took many Days Con&s;ideration, in which many offen&s;ive Pa&s;&s;ages were &s;truck out; tho' I am told there &s;tilll remain, at lea&s;t in the Letter to Mr. DeBerdt, &s;everal bold Expre&s;&s;ions. The&s;e two Letters took up 18 Days, after which the Committee reported an Addre&s;s to the King, which was concluded and agreed upon in 4 or 5 Days more. When the two fir&s;t Letters were fini&s;hed, I directed the Secretary to a&s;k the Speaker to let me have a Sight of them, as I had been always u&s;ed to do in like Ca&s;es, without ever being refu&s;ed. The Speaker &s;aid he mu&s;t advi&s;e about it, and afterwards told the Secre|tary that there was an Order of the Hou&s;e that no Copies &s;hould be taken, and therefore he could not let me have them. The Secretary replied that that was no Objection to my &s;eeing them, for that I did not want any Copy, and would give him any A&s;&s;urance that no Copy &s;hould be taken, whil&s;t in my Hands; and advi&s;ed him to &s;ee me. The Speaker came to me and repeating his Difficulties, offered to take the Opinion of the Hou&s;e. I told him he &s;hould new move the Hou&s;e in my Name, for I would not put it in their Power to refu&s;e me this; that I had already waited five Days for a Sight of tho&s;e Papers; and if he would not let me have it now, I &s;hould take it as a Refu&s;al, and &s;hould acquaint the Secretary of State with it; he &s;till &s;aid that he would endeavour to get Leave to &s;hew them to me, but nothing has been done. I mu&s;t add, that I by no Means apprehend this to be an Affront to my Per&s;on, but my Office; for at this Time the Speaker him&s;elf &s;eemed uncommonly de&s;irous by &s;ome other Means to per&s;uade me of his Re&s;pect; and the Hou&s;e, from the Time of the opening the Se&s;&s;ion to this Day, has &s;hewn their Di&s;po&s;ition to avoid all Di&s;pute with me, every Thing having pa&s;&s;ed with as much good
<PB N="5" REF="011176_0003_0F862BCEDBDE2F90">
Humour as I could de&s;ire, except only their continuing to act in addre&s;&s;ing the King, remon&s;trating to the Secretary of State, and employing a &s;eparate Agent, as if they were the States General of the Province, without a Governor or a King's Council.</P>
<P>It is the Importance of this Innovation, without any Wilfulne&s;s of my own, which induces me to make this Re|mon&s;trance to your Lord&s;hip, at a Time when I have a fair Pro&s;pect of having in all other Bu&s;ine&s;s nothing but Good to &s;ay of the Proceedings of this Hou&s;e, I mean &s;o far as their Di&s;po&s;ition has hitherto appeared.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Bo&s;ton 30th January 1768.</HEAD>
<P>I Received your Lord&s;hip's Letter No. 11, by the Novem|ber Mail, which arrived here this Day Se'nnight, the October Mail which has other Letters of your Lord&s;hip for me, is not arrived here, tho' by the Accounts we have it is daily expected; I have therefore at pre&s;ent only to &s;ay, that I &s;hall regard the Letter now received rather for my own In&s;truction, than a Direction to others. The Time is not yet come when the Hou&s;e is to be moved again&s;t popular Printers, however proflgiate and flagitious. But if there was a View of Succe&s;s, I &s;hould by no Means think is proper to make &s;uch an Attempt now when the Hou&s;e &s;hows &s;o good a Di&s;po&s;ition to a Reconciliation to Government, of which they have given good Proof, &s;ince the Date of my former Letter. They have acted in all Things, even in their Remon&s;trance (as far as I who have not been allowed a Sight of it can learn) with Temper and Moderation: They have avoided &s;ome Subjects of Di&s;pute, and have laid a Foundation for removing &s;ome Cau&s;es of former Alterca|tions: I &s;peak this only from private Report, nothing of this Kind very material having as yet come up to me.</P>
<P>But in one Thing the Hou&s;e has &s;hown it&s;elf contra-agent to the Faction, who want again to embroil America. There is no doubt but the principal De&s;ign in forming the&s;e Re|mon&s;trances was to &s;et an Example to the Re&s;t of America, and produce a general Clamour from every other A&s;&s;embly again&s;t the late Acts. This was partly defeated by my re|fu&s;ing to call the A&s;&s;embly before the u&s;ual Time; and again by the Hou&s;e re&s;olving to form their Remon&s;trance
<PB N="6" REF="011176_0004_0F862BCF823212A0">
in &s;uch a Manner that it &s;hould not of Nece&s;&s;ity be made public; but tho' this la&s;t Intention was quite incon&s;i&s;tent with the Purpo&s;e of communicating the Sub&s;tance of their Remon&s;trance to the other A&s;&s;emblies, yet it did not di&s;cou|rage the Party from attempting it; the Hou&s;e was accord|ingly moved that a Day be a&s;&s;igned to take into Con&s;idera|tion the Propriety of informing the other Governments with their Proceedings again&s;t the late Acts, that, if they thought fit, they might join therein. Upon the Day this was &s;trongly oppo&s;ed and fully debated; it was &s;aid by the Oppo&s;ers of the Motion, that this would be con&s;idered at Home as ap|pointing another Congre&s;s, and perhaps the former was not yet forgot. Upon the clo&s;e of the Debate, it was carried in the Negative by at lea&s;t 2 to 1. No one Tran&s;action in the Hou&s;e has given me &s;o great Hopes that they are return|ing to a right Sen&s;e of their Duty and their true Intere&s;t, as this has done; and I hope it will make &s;ome Atonement for their Remon&s;trances.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Bo&s;ton, February 18, 1768.</HEAD>
<P>BY my Letter No. 2, I informed your Lord&s;hip that a Motion in the Hou&s;e for circulating a Copy of their Proceedings again&s;t the late Acts of Parliament to all the A&s;&s;emblies on the Continent had been rejected by above 2 to 1; and that I formed promi&s;ing Conclu&s;ions from this Defeat of the factious Party; but I was too ha&s;ty in my Approbation of the Conduct of the Hou&s;e. This was too great a Point to be given up, the Party therefore re&s;olved to make another Effort, and having prepared the Way by privately tampering with, and influencing Particulars, they moved that all the former Proceedings upon this Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be obliterated out of the Journal, which being agreed to, the Way became clear for another Motion that a Com|mittee &s;hould be appointed to prepare a circular Letter to the &s;everal Speakers of the A&s;&s;emblies upon the Continent, containing an Ab&s;tract of their Remon&s;trances again&s;t the late Acts, and a de&s;ire that the other A&s;&s;emblies <HI>would join</HI> with them; a Letter was pre&s;ently reported and agreed to by the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I knew that this was pa&s;t, I got the Speaker to come to me, and in the Pre&s;ence of the Secretary required a Copy of the Circular Letter that I might tran&s;mit it to your Lord&s;hip, to whom I &s;aid I &s;hould be obliged to &s;end an Account of this extraordinary Proceeding, which I feared would be thought &s;imilar to the Congre&s;s in 1765. He &s;aid that he did not doubt but that it would be ea&s;ily obtained, with the Leave of the Hou&s;e. He accordingly asked the Leave of the Hou&s;e the next Day, which he not only ob|tained for the Copy in Que&s;tion, but al&s;o for the other Pro|ceedings of which he had refu&s;ed me the Sight &s;ome Time before.</P>
<P>I now &s;end your Lord&s;hip a Copy of this Circular Letter, which I would animadvert upon, if the Time would per|mit; at pre&s;ent I will only make two Ob&s;ervations, 1&s;t. That this pre&s;ent Undertaking is calculated to inflame the whole Continent, and engage them to join together in another Di&s;pute with the Parliament about the Authority of the latter; altho' the pre&s;ent Subject Matter was profe&s;&s;edly allowed by the Americans them&s;elves to be within the Bounds of the Power of Parliament at the Time of the former Di&s;pute. 2dly, That the Di&s;tinctions, by Means of which they now transfer the Matters contained in the late Act of
<PB N="8" REF="011176_0005_0F862BD026157B30">
Parliament, from the Range of what they Before conceded to Parliament, to that of what they before denied, is equally conclu&s;ive of all Acts of Parliament impo&s;ing Duties in any of the American Ports, and con&s;equently if the la&s;t Act &s;hould be given up to tho&s;e Pretentions, all other Acts of American Revenue mu&s;t follow. I &s;hall write fully to your Lord&s;hip upon this Subject when I have Lei&s;ure to review the Proceedings of this Se&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Bo&s;ton, March 5th, 1768.</HEAD>
<P>YESTERDAY I prorogued the General A&s;&s;embly, after a Se&s;&s;ion of above nine Weeks, the greate&s;t Part of which was &s;pent in animadverting upon, and counterworking the late Acts of Parliament concerning the Revenue, &s;o that there was not Time eno' to do the Provincial Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor even all of that which I recommended to them at the open|ing of the Se&s;&s;ion, &s;ome of the Productions of the&s;e Animad|ver&s;ions will come to your Lord&s;hip directly from the Speaker of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Circular Letter to the Re&s;t of the Colonies, I have already &s;ent to your Lord&s;hip; there is a Letter I am told from the Hou&s;e to the Lords of the Trea&s;ury, but there is no Occa&s;ion for my communicating that; I now &s;end a Copy of the Re&s;olves of the Hou&s;e upon Importations and Manu|factures; it is &s;o decently and cautiou&s;ly worded, that at another Time it would &s;carce have given Offence: but they boa&s;t of it, as it was meant to be a Confirmation of the Bo&s;ton Re&s;olves.</P>
<P>On February 28th appeared in the Bo&s;ton Gazette a viru|lent Libel again&s;t me&mdash;I had never before taken any Notice of the Libels publi&s;hed in the Bo&s;ton Gazette; but this was attended with &s;o many Circum&s;tances of Flagitiou&s;ne&s;s that I did not think I could with Safety to the Government pa&s;s it by unnoticed; I therefore next Morning laid it before the Council at a very full Board, there being 20 pre&s;ent, which is the whole Number but 3. It was received with general Dete&s;tation; mo&s;t of the Gentlemen &s;poke to te&s;tify their Abhorrence of it, and it was remarkable that &s;ome of tho&s;e who heretofore had been inclined to the popular Side, were mo&s;t loud in their Re&s;entments of this Outrage. In the
<PB N="9" REF="011176_0005_0F862BD026157B30">
End they unanimou&s;ly advi&s;ed me to lay it before the two Hou&s;es of the General Court, that is, them&s;elves in their Legi&s;lative Capacity, and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. This I did by a Me&s;&s;age to each, in the Terms inclo&s;ed which are the &s;ame except in the proper Di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>The Board appointed a Committee to prepare an An&s;wer to my Me&s;&s;age, which was reported and agreed upon una|nimou&s;ly by the &s;ame Number as before mentioned: In the Hou&s;e which was grown thin and evacuated by the Friends of government in greater Proportion than the Opponents. It had not the &s;ame Succe&s;s. They labour'd with all their Might to prevent the Paper being cen&s;ured. It was debat|ed a whole Afternoon, and adjourned to the next Morning, during which Interval all the u&s;ual Practices of tampering with the Members were employed, and the next Day upon a Vote the Con&s;ideration of the Libel was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The chief Argument u&s;ed for this Purpo&s;e was that as there was no Name u&s;ed, it was not a Libel in Law, and would not be con&s;idered &s;o in a Court of Ju&s;tice, it was finally agreed that the Me&s;&s;age as inclo&s;ed &s;hould be &s;ent to me. The Faction carried their Points by &s;mall Majorities; upon the la&s;t Que&s;tion the Numbers were 39 to 30, the greater of which is about one third Part of the whole Hou&s;e; upon this Occa&s;ion&mdash;behaved in the Hou&s;e like a Madman; he abu&s;ed every one in Authority, and e&s;pecially the Coun|cil in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Terms.</P>
<P>The next Morning he came into the Council Chamber, before the Board met, and having read the Council's Addre&s;s, he with Oaths and Imprecations vowed Vengeance upon the whole Council at the next Election, and told one Councellor who happened to be there, that he never &s;hould &s;it at that Board after his Year was out. This is the Man who makes &s;uch a Di&s;turbance about my u&s;ing my Negative in the Ap|pointment of Councellors; the annual Election of whom is the Canker Worm of the Con&s;titution of this Government.</P>
<P>It may be expected that after &s;uch &s;trong Declarations again&s;t this Libel, the Council would have joined with me in the Pro&s;ecution of the Printers, but that could not be brought about; it was known that I intended to move that Bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore one of the Board in the Name of &s;ome of my Friends was &s;ent to me to advi&s;e the contrary. It was &s;ugge&s;ted it would be better to leave the Matter where it &s;tood, with a continued Unanimity of the (almo&s;t) whole Council, than by proceeding farther to divide them,
<PB N="10" REF="011176_0006_0F862BD0EF9F44D8">
e&s;pecially as it was thought probable that a Vote for a Pro|&s;ecution might not be obtained. It was &s;atisfied with the&s;e Rea&s;ons, and declined making any further Motion. This is one of the Con&s;equences of that fatal Ingredient in this Con&s;titution, the Election of the Council, which will always weaken this Government, &s;o that the be&s;t Management will never make it's Weight capable of being put in the Scales again&s;t that of the People, tho' the late Act of Parliament will do much toward it. However, I ordered the Attorney General to procure Informations, &s;o that if a Pro&s;ecution may hereafter be thought advi&s;eable, it may be practicable. But after all, the&s;e Printers are an&s;werable to Great-Britain, an Hundred Times more than they are to this; and while that Debt remains un&s;atisfied, we ought not to complain that it is not paid here.</P>
<P>I had intended when I prorogued the General Court to have made a &s;hort Speech to the Hou&s;e in An&s;wer to their la&s;t Me&s;&s;age on your Lord&s;hip's Letter; but their publi&s;h|ing that Me&s;&s;age in one of their Papers, and that virulent Libel in the next, &s;hewed &s;uch a determined De&s;ign to mi&s;|repre&s;ent me to the People, that I was obliged to enter more fully into my Ju&s;tification than I intended to have done at fir&s;t; and accordingly I delivered the Speech inclo&s;ed: I Approbation it has received from all Parties in this Town; it is intended to open the Eyes of the People, to the Wickedne&s;s of this factious Junto, though perhaps they will not &s;ee it clearly 'till they feel &s;ome of the Effects of it's Machinations, which cannot fail of coming upon them in &s;ome Shape or other, as they are now going on.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Bo&s;ton, March 12, 1768.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE I wrote my la&s;t the Superior Court has been opened at Bo&s;ton, upon which Occa&s;ion the Chief Ju&s;tice (Lieutenant-Governor) made a long and forcible Charge to the Grand Jury upon the Subject of the Libels publi&s;hed in the Bo&s;ton Gazette, and particularly that which has been lately animadverted upon by the Council. This &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected the Grand Jury and all the Hearers of it, that it left no Doubt in the Mind of any one pre&s;ent, that the Grand Jury would find a Bill again&s;t the Printers. And
<PB N="11" REF="011176_0006_0F862BD0EF9F44D8">
they them&s;elves had &s;o little Doubt of it, that as &s;oon as they came out Court they &s;ent for the Attorney General, and directed him to prepare a Bill again&s;t the next Morning.</P>
<P>But in the Interval, the Faction who conducts that Paper, was indefatigable in tampering with the Jury, &s;o that when the Bu&s;ine&s;s was re&s;umed the next Day, that Bill was op|po&s;ed &s;o effectually that it pa&s;&s;ed in the Negative by a &s;mall Majority, &s;ome &s;ay of one only. Upon this Occa&s;ion the Managers of the Paper were &s;een publickly, to haunt the Grand Jury-men wherever they went.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible People who have a Regard for their Country are much concerned at this Defeat of Ju&s;tice. They &s;ay that it is a Symptom of &s;uch extreme Weakne&s;s in the Government, that it affords little Hopes of its Recovery. And indeed I do not expect the Government will ever recover its Authority with|out Aid from &s;uperior Powers. If the Oppo&s;ition was di|rected only again&s;t Per&s;ons and Mea&s;ures, a Reconciliation might and would &s;oon take Place, and all might be well again. But Men and Mea&s;ures are only nominal Defendants, the Authority of the King, the Supremacy of Parliament, the Superiority of Government, are the real Objects of the Attack, and a general levelling of all the Powers of Govern|ment, and reducing it into the Hands of the whole People, is what is aimed at, and will, at lea&s;t in &s;ome Degree, &s;uc|ceed, without &s;ome external A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Council which formerly u&s;ed to be revered by the People, has lo&s;t its Weight, and notwith&s;tanding their late &s;pirited Exertion, is in general timid and irre&s;olute, e&s;pecially when the annual Election draws near. That fatal Ingredient in the Compo|&s;ition of this Con&s;titution is the Bane of the whole, and never will the Royal Scale be balanced with that of the Peo|ple till the Weight of the Council is wholly put into the former. The making the Council independent of the Peo|ple (even tho' they &s;hould &s;till receive their original Appoint|ment from them) would go far to cure all the Di&s;orders which this Government is &s;ubject to. But my Lord, whil&s;t I am treating of the Con&s;titutional Imbecility of the Coun|cil, I mu&s;t not forget my Promi&s;e that I would repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty the public-&s;pirited Conduct of the Council during this la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion. I mu&s;t therefore beg Leave to a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, that in many Tran&s;actions in this la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, the Council have in general &s;hown great Attention to the Sup|port of the Government and the Welfare of the People, and have upon many Occa&s;ions &s;hewn a Re&s;olution and Stea|dine&s;s

in promoting his Maje&s;ty's Service, which would have done Honour to his Maje&s;ty's Appointment if they had wholly held their Places under it, which makes it more to be lamented that &s;uch Men &s;hould be &s;ubjected to be con|tinually threatned to be turned out of their Places, when|ever they exerci&s;e the Dictates of their own Judgments in Contravention to the Fury of a &s;editious Demagogue.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit to do Ju&s;tice to the &s;pirited Conduct of the Lieutenant Governor, in his Function of Chief Ju&s;tice.

Where there is a Failure of this Exertion, it will ari&s;e either from the Defaults of Juries, or from the Controul which in this defencele&s;s Government the common People &s;ometimes exerci&s;e over of Laws, e&s;pecially the Laws of Great-Britain. The Chief Ju&s;tice has been much pre&s;t to print his Charge; but has hitherto declined it. However, he has reduced it to writing, that if it &s;hould be mi&s;repre|&s;ented in the Bo&s;ton Gazette (as from the great Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s which reigns here is very probable) he may be able to ju&s;tify him&s;elf. In the mean Time, as he has begun with the&s;e Printers, he will I dare &s;ay, pur&s;ue his Purpo&s;e; and as the Publication of this Paper is a Crime committed in every County in the Province; it is probable, that ano|ther Grand Jury may not be &s;o regardle&s;s of their Oath and their Duty to their Country, as this has been.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Bo&s;ton, March 19th 1768.</HEAD>

<P>I Expected that the Appointment of Commi&s;&s;ioners of Cu&s;toms, in America, would have made it unnece&s;&s;ary for me to have troubled your Lord&s;hip with any Repre&s;en|tations upon the Subject of the Cu&s;toms. But I &s;ee &s;uch an Oppo&s;ition to the Commi&s;&s;ioners and their Officers, and &s;uch a Defiance to the Authority by which they are ap|pointed continually growing, that I can no longer excu&s;e my informing your Lord&s;hip of the Detail of Facts from whence the mo&s;t dangerous Con&s;equences are to be expected.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011176_0007_0F862BD1A6A82DE0">
It is &s;ome Time &s;ince there have been frequently Reports of In&s;urrections intended, in which it has been &s;aid the Hou&s;es of one or more of the Commi&s;&s;ioners and their Offi|cers would be pulled down; two were more particularly fixed upon. Upon one of the&s;e Nights a Number of Lads about 100, paraded the Town with a Drum and Horns, pa&s;&s;ed by the Council Chamber whil&s;t I was &s;itting there in Council, a&s;&s;embled before Mr. Paxton's (a Commi&s;&s;ioner's) Hou&s;e, and Huzza'd, and to the Number of at lea&s;t 60 ju&s;ty Fellows (as I am a&s;&s;ured) inve&s;ted Mr. Burch's (another Commi&s;&s;ioner's Hou&s;e) for &s;ome Time, &s;o that his Lady and Children were obliged to go out of the back Door to avoid the Danger which was threatened. This Kind of Di&s;tur|bance was kept up all the Evening, and after all was treated at the Diver&s;ion of a few Boys a Matter of no Con&s;equence. This was I think on March the 4th.</P>
<P>After this it was reported that the In&s;urrection was po&s;t|poned till March 18th, which was the Anniver&s;ary of the Repeal of the Stamp-Act, upon which Day Effigies were to be exhibited, and two Per&s;ons, Mr. Paxton a Commi&s;&s;ioner, and Mr. Williams one of the In&s;pectors General, were men|tioned as devoted to the Re&s;entment of the Mob. I took all the Pains I could to di&s;cover the Truth of this Report, but could get no other An&s;wer, but A&s;&s;urances that no &s;uch Thing would be done or &s;uffered. On the very Day before I &s;poke with the mo&s;t knowing Men I could procure, who were very po&s;itive that no Effiges would be hung up, and yet late that Evening I had certain Advice that Effigies were prepared, but it was too late to do any Thing, and my Information was of that Nature I could not make u&s;e of it in Public.</P>
<P>Early the next Morning the Sheriff came to me to inform me that the Effigies of Mr. Paxton and Mr. Williams were hanging upon Liberty-Tree. I had the Day before ap|pointed a Council to meet, and I now &s;ent round to get them together as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible it might be. Before I went to Council I learned that the Effigies had been taken down by &s;ome of the Neighbours without any Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>At Council I &s;et forth in &s;trong Terms the Atrociou&s;ne&s;s of this In&s;ult, the Danger of it's being followed by actual Violence, and the Nece&s;&s;ity there was of providing for the Pre&s;ervation of the Peace of the Town. But all I could &s;ay made no Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Council, they per&s;evered in treating the Affair as of no Con&s;equence, and a&s;&s;uring
<PB N="14" REF="011176_0008_0F862BD26EACE5F8">
me that there was no Danger of any Commotion. After they had given their Opinion as in the inclo&s;ed Copy of the Minutes, I received a Letter from the Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;etting forth the In&s;ult they had received, the Danger they appre|hended, and de&s;iring the Protection of the Government. I communicated this to the Council, and propo&s;ed that they &s;hould recon&s;ider this Bu&s;ine&s;s, but finding them not inclined to depart from their Opinion as before given; I adjourned the recon&s;ideration till the Afternoon. In the Afternoon upon the Que&s;tion being put to them again they adhered to their former Opinion.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mentioned before, that under all the&s;e A&s;|&s;urances I had, that there would be no Di&s;turbances, it was never under&s;tood that the Day, the Anniver&s;ary of the Repeal of the Stamp-Act &s;hould not be celebrated; accord|ingly at break of Day there were beating of Drums, and firing of Guns heard, and the whole Town was adorned with Ships Colours, and to add to the Celebration the Fea&s;t of Saint Patrick being the Day before was po&s;tponed to this Day.</P>
<P>However, great Pains were taken by the Selectmen of the Town, and &s;ome other Gentlemen, that the Fe&s;tivity &s;hould not produce a Riot in the Evening, and &s;o far it &s;ucceeded that it produced Terror only, and not actual Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>There was a Number of Gentlemen dined at two Taverns near the Town Hou&s;e, upon the Occa&s;ion of the Day. The&s;e broke up in good Time; after which many of the &s;ame and other Gentlemen kept together at the Coffee-Hou&s;e (one of the Taverns) all the Evening. The&s;e prevented the lighting a Bonfire in that Street, which was &s;everal Times attempted, and would probably have been a Prelude to Action. But the a&s;&s;embling a great Number of People of all Kinds, Sexes and Ages, many of which &s;hewed a great Di&s;po&s;ition to the utmo&s;t Di&s;order, could not be prevented. There were many Hundreds of them paraded the Streets with Yells and Outcries which were quite terrible. I had in my Hou&s;e Mr. Burch one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners and his Lady and Children, who had the Day before moved to our Hou&s;e for Safety.</P>
<P>I had al&s;o with me the Lieutenant-Governor and Sheriff of the County. But I had taken no Steps to fortify my Hou&s;e, not being willing to &s;how an Apprehen&s;ion of Dan|ger to my&s;elf. But at one Time there was &s;o terrible a Yell from the Mob going by, that it was apprehended that they were breaking in, but it was not &s;o. However, it
<PB N="15" REF="011176_0008_0F862BD26EACE5F8">
cau&s;ed the &s;ame Terror as if it had been &s;o; and the Lady, a Stranger to this Country, who cho&s;e our Hou&s;e for an A&s;ylum, has not recovered it as yet. They went on and inve&s;ted Mr. Williams's Hou&s;e, but he &s;hewed him&s;elf at a Window, and told them that he was ready for their Recep|tion, and they went off, and either did not intend or dared not to attack his Hou&s;e. They al&s;o at two different Times about Midnight made Outcries about Mr. Paxton's Hou&s;e, out of mere Wantonne&s;s to terrify his Family. The whole made it a very terrible Night to tho&s;e who thought them&s;elves Objects of the popular Fury; and yet if I &s;hould complain of it, I &s;hould be told that it was nothing but the common Effects of Fe&s;tivity and Rejoicing, and there was no Harm intended.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will perhaps a&s;k what I have been doing all this while, that this Spirit of Di&s;order is got to &s;uch a Pitch; I an&s;wer, every Thing in my Power to prevent it; &s;ince fir&s;t the&s;e Tumults were apprehended, the Commi&s;&s;io|ners, with whom (I mean 4 of the 5) I am upon the mo&s;t intimate Terms, have often a&s;ked me, what Support to their Office, or Protection for them&s;elves, I can afford: I an&s;wer, none in the World. For tho' I am allowed to proceed in the Ordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Government without Interrup|tion; in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a popular Oppo&s;ition to the Laws of Great-Britain founded upon the Pretentions of Rights and Priviledges, I have not the Shadow of Authority or Power. I am ju&s;t now in the Situation I was in about two Years ago, &s;ure to be made obnoxious to the Madne&s;s of the People, by the Te&s;timony I am obliged to bear again&s;t it, and yet left expo&s;ed to their Re&s;entment without any po&s;&s;ible Re&s;ort of Protection. I am then a&s;ked why I don't apply for Troops as well to &s;upport the King's Government as to protect the Per&s;ons of his Officers. I an&s;wer, becau&s;e I don't think it proper or prudent to make &s;uch Application upon my own Opinion only.</P>
<P>All the King's Governors are directed to take the Advice of the Council in Military Movements; and in this Govern|ment where the Governor is in a more peculiar Manner ob|liged to have the Advice of the Council for almo&s;t every Thing he does, it would be dangerous to act in &s;uch an important Bu&s;ine&s;s without &s;uch Advice. And it is in vain to put &s;uch a Que&s;tion to the Council, for, con&s;idering the Influence they are under from their being Creatures of the People, and the per&s;onal Danger they wou'd by &s;ubject to in
<PB N="16" REF="011176_0009_0F862BD324FB7BC8">
a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the re&s;training them, it is not probable that the utmo&s;t Extremity of Mi&s;chief and Danger would induce them to advi&s;e &s;uch a Mea&s;ure. I have once before tried the Experiment when the Danger was more urgent and im|mediate than is now; and the Succe&s;s then fully convinced me that it is to no Purpo&s;e ever again to repeat the Que&s;tion. His Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters have within the&s;e three Years been fully acquainted with the Defencele&s;s State of this Govern|ment, and therefore I tru&s;t that I &s;hall be excu&s;ed leaving it entirely to the Admini&s;tration to determine upon a Mea|&s;ure, which they are much more able to judge of, and be an&s;werable for, than I can be. I &s;hall have Danger and Trouble enough when &s;uch Orders arrive, tho' I keep ever &s;o clear of advi&s;ing or promoting them. The&s;e, my Lord, are the An&s;wers I have given to the Commi&s;&s;ioners in the Cour&s;e of Conver&s;ation which I have thought proper to re|capitulate in this Place for my own Vindication if it &s;hould be needful. I &s;hould have mentioned before, but for not interrupting the Narrative, that in the Debate at the Council one Gentleman &s;aid that there were A&s;&s;ociations formed for pre&s;erving the Peace of the Town; I &s;aid that I had not been made acquainted with them, that if there were any &s;uch they ought to have been formed with my Privity, and confirmed by my Authority. That if a general A&s;&s;ociation for &s;upporting the Authority of the Government and pre|&s;erving the Peace of the Town could be brought about, it would be of great Service, and I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee it &s;et about immediately. Upon this a Councellor got up with Vehemence, and &s;aid, that &s;uch a Sub&s;cription was illegal and uncon&s;titutional, and he &s;hould prote&s;t again&s;t it, as tending to bring an Approbium on the Town. I &s;aid that at a Time when a Sub&s;cription was handed about the Town in direct Oppo&s;ition to the Parliament and People of Great-Britain, and was every Day enforced by Menaces, and other unfair Methods, it was very extraordinary at that Board to hear a Sub&s;cription for the Support of Government and Pre|&s;ervation of Peace called illegal. That I &s;hould not endea|vour to pre&s;s a Mea&s;ure which would derive its chief Efficacy from being voluntary, but I feared they would &s;ee the Expe|diency of &s;uch a Mea&s;ure when it was to late. From this and the generality of the A&s;&s;urances that no Mi&s;chief would be done, I am to under&s;tand that the Pre&s;ervation of the Peace of this Town is to depend upon tho&s;e who have the Command of the Mob, and can re&s;train them (and of cour&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="011176_0009_0F862BD324FB7BC8">
let them loo&s;e) when they plea&s;e, and Civil Authority is not to interpo&s;e in this Bu&s;ine&s;s; and indeed I have with Atten|tion ob&s;erved that all the A&s;&s;urances that no Mi&s;chief was intended at pre&s;ent, are founded upon the Impropriety of u&s;ing Violence at a Time when they were applying to the Government and Parliament of Great-Britain for Redre&s;s. But it is inferred, and &s;ometimes expre&s;ly declared, that when they have Advice that the Redre&s;s which they expect is de|nied, they will immediately proceed to do them&s;elves Ju&s;tice. And it is now become common Talk that they will not &s;ub|mit to Duties impo&s;ed by Parliament, not only tho&s;e im|po&s;ed by the late Acts, but all others which rai&s;e a Revenue. This is public Talk&punc; as for the &s;anguine Expectations which the Faction, from who&s;e Cabinet all the&s;e Troubles have ari&s;en, has formed for comptrolling and triumphing over Great-Britain; I dare not repeat what I have heard till their Purpo&s;es become more apparent.</P>
<P>In this Narrative I have taken no Notice of the Town Meetings, Meetings of Merchants, Sub&s;criptions for not im|porting Engli&s;h Goods, Propo&s;als for Manufactures, &amp;c. which have been carrying on before and during the whole aforementioned Time. I intend to make a &s;eperate Letter upon the&s;e Subjects, which po&s;&s;ibly may accompany this, as I am not at pre&s;ent apprized of a Conveyance &s;afe enough to tru&s;t this by.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Shelburne, dated Bo&s;ton, March 21&s;t, 1768.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t Letter I omitted giving your Lord&s;hip an Ac|count of the meetings of the Merchants, &amp;c. within the time I was de&s;cribing, as I re&s;erved it for a &s;eperate Letter; as the two Subjects are not nece&s;&s;arily connected, and I can't &s;ay how far they are really &s;o. The&s;e Proceedings how|ever &s;o immediately followed a particular Tran&s;action, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to begin the Narrative with that.</P>
<P>About the middle of February one Malcom a Trader who about 18 Months before made him&s;elf famous by a vi|olent and riotous Re&s;i&s;tance to the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Officers, endeavouring to &s;earch his Hou&s;e for uncu&s;tomed Goods, (of which there is a very full Account in your Lord&s;hip's
<PB N="18" REF="011176_0010_0F862BD4273D5D48">
Office) expecting a Schooner laden with Fyal Wines to come in, a&s;ked an Officer of the Cu&s;toms, what Indulgence he might expect in regard to the Duties. The Officer an&s;wer|ed him, none at all; he mu&s;t pay the whole Duties; Mal|com replied, he was glad to know what he had to tru&s;t to. Some days after the Schooner came in, and was ordered to anchor among the I&s;lands 5 Miles below the Town. From thence the Cargo, con&s;i&s;ting as is &s;aid, of above 60 Pipes of Wine was landed in the Night, and carried in Drays to dif|ferent Cellars, each Load being guarded by a Party of Men with Clubs. This bu&s;ine&s;s employed a number of men the greate&s;t part of the night, and was as notorious, by the noi&s;e it occa&s;ioned for many Hours together, as if it had been done at noonday. The Lading of the Schooner was al&s;o public|ly known &amp; talked of long before &s;he arrived. She appeared plainly when &s;he came up to Town by well-known Marks to have been lightened a yard or more, and was evidently too light to bear the Sea. Neverthele&s;s the Ma&s;ter went to the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e, and Swore that &s;he came from Suranam in Balla&s;t, and had landed nothing &s;ince &s;he left that Port.</P>
<P>Two or three Days after, this Malcom procured a Meeting of &s;ome Merchants and Traders at which he pre&s;ided. Their Deliberations were Sanguine, and full of high Pre|ten&s;ions; but nothing was determined upon, but to call a general Meeting of the Merchants on Friday March 4th. This may be &s;aid, to be the fir&s;t movement of the Merchants again&s;t the Acts of Parliament: all the proceedings before were carried on at Town Meetings, and were rather upon Refinements of Policy than concern for Trade. There ne|ver was le&s;s Rea&s;on for the Merchants to complain of the Regulations of Trade than at pre&s;ent; there never was a greater Plenty of Money, or a more apparent Balance of Trade in their Favour, of which the State of Exchange with London, which now is, and for a long time, has been at Par, is an irrefragable Evidence. However, the Mer|chants are at length dragged into the Cau&s;e, their Intercour&s;e and Connections with the Politicians, and the &s;ear of op|po&s;ing the Stream of the People, have at length brought it about again&s;t the Sen&s;e of an undoubted Majority both of Numbers, Property and Weight. Accordingly the Re&s;ult of this Meeting was, that a Sub&s;cription for not importing any Engli&s;h Goods, except for the Fi&s;hery for 18 Months, &s;hould be prepared and carried round the Town, and a Committee was appointed for that purpo&s;e. This was the &s;ame night
<PB N="19" REF="011176_0010_0F862BD4273D5D48">
that the little Mob with the Drum pa&s;&s;ed by the Town-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the Sub&s;cription Paper fir&s;t going round the Town, it met with no great &s;ucce&s;s; A great many declined it as indeed it cannot fail being ruinous to the Generality of Traders. Upon this, all Engines were &s;et to Work to in|crea&s;e the Sub&s;cription; &s;ome were told they would be ob|noxious to the lower &s;ort of people; others were threatened with the re&s;entment of the higher: Some were made afraid for their Per&s;ons and Hou&s;es; others for their Trade and Credit. By &s;uch means the &s;ub&s;cription has been filled by numbers, who if at Liberty would prote&s;t again&s;t the force put upon them, and neither intend nor can comply with the Terms, and there are &s;till remaining enough of the mo&s;t re&s;|pectable Merchants in the Town, Non-Sub&s;cribers, to defeat this Scheme, even if the Sub&s;cribers were to keep to their promi&s;e&punc; and it never can be carried into execution without the interpo&s;ition of the Mob. But it is &s;carce a Secret with any of them, that the chief Intent of this Sub&s;cription is to rai&s;e an Alarm among the Merchants and Traders of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate the foregoing Narrative, I &s;end your Lord|&s;hip their own Account of the Meeting on the 18th, with a Li&s;t of the Toa&s;ts as u&s;ual. There is al&s;o in the &s;ame Pa|per, a piece containing a Sneer upon the late Proceedings of Parliament; the whole Wit of which ari&s;es from the com|mon A&s;&s;ertion, that the Parliament has no Right to impo&s;e Duties in the American Colonies&mdash;no more than they have in Portugal. In the &s;ame is al&s;o the Letter to your Lord|&s;hip, and the Addre&s;s to the King is in another of the &s;ame Papers, and in others. This &s;hews that the chief u&s;e of the&s;e Letters is to inflame the other Colonies: for unle&s;s they preferred this Service to the obtaining Redre&s;s from Home, they could not be &s;o deficient in Duty, Re&s;pect and even common Civility, as to publi&s;h in America an Addre&s;s to the King, and a Letter to his Mini&s;ter of State; before they could have come to hand in England. Heretofore even a complimentary Addre&s;s to the King never u&s;ed to be pub|li&s;hed in America, till it appeared there in the Gazette. In &s;hort, your Lord&s;hip may depend upon it, that nothing le&s;s than the Abolition of all the Acts impo&s;ing Duties is propo&s;ed. When that is done, the Tran&s;ition to all other Acts of Par|liament will be very &s;hort and ea&s;y.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to inform your Lord&s;hip that a great Riot has happened in this Town la&s;t Evening, which had very bad Con&s;equences, tho' happily there were no Lives lo&s;t. The Collector and Comptroller of this Port &s;eized a Sloop for openly and forcibly landing a Cargo of Wines without paying Duty, and by Means of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Romney Man of War &s;ecured her. Upon their Return Home they were attacked by a Mob with Clubs, Stones and Brickbats; Mr. Harri&s;on the Collector was much brui&s;ed, particularly in the Brea&s;t, but kept his Legs &s;o as to e&s;cape thro' an Alley. Mr. Hallowell, the Comptroller, <HI>was knocked down and left on the Ground covered with Blood.</HI> He has many Wounds and Brui&s;es, but none dangerous to Life. Mr. Har|ri&s;on's Son, a young Gentleman not in any Office, who ac|companied his Father, was knocked down and dragged by the Hair of his Head, and would have been killed, if he had not been got into a Hou&s;e by &s;ome Standers by. In another Part of the Town Mr. Irvine, under the Board of Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, was attacked by another Mob, very much beat and abu&s;ed, and would probably have been killed if he had not been re&s;cued by two of the Mob, and enabled to e&s;cape thro' an Hou&s;e. This Gentleman was no Ways concerned in the Seizure.</P>
<P>After this they went to Mr. Hallowell's Hou&s;e, and began to break the Windows and force an Entry, but were divert|ed therefrom by A&s;&s;urances that Mr. Hallowell was almo&s;t killed, and was not at Home. They then went to Mr. Harri&s;on's and broke his Windows: but he not being at Home, and the Owner of the Hou&s;e entreating them to de|part they left it. Then they went to Mr. Williams's Hou&s;e, one of the In&s;pectors general, who was then at a Di&s;tance from Bo&s;ton, and broke near an hundred Panes, and did other Damage to the Hou&s;e, but upon Mrs. Williams ap|pearing and a&s;&s;uring them, that he was ab&s;ent, and only &s;he was at Home they departed. Happily they did not break into any Hou&s;e, for if they had got at a Cellar, the Mi&s;chiefs would have been greater and more exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>After this they went to a Wharf were lay a Plea&s;ure Boat belonging to Mr. Harri&s;on, built by him&s;elf in a particular and elegant Manner. This they took out of the Water,
<PB N="21" REF="011176_0011_0F862BD69CFDAD38">
and carried it into the Common and burnt it. By this Time there were about 500, &s;ome &s;ay, 1,000 Men gathered to|gether whil&s;t the Boat was burning. Some Gentlemen, who had an influence over them, per&s;uaded them to depart: this was debated and put to the Vote, whereupon Proclamation was made, "each Man to his Tent." Before this they were harangued by a Leader, who among others, u&s;ed the&s;e Words as they have been reported to me. "We will &s;up|port our Liberties, depending upon the &s;trength of our own Arms and God." Whil&s;t they were upon the Common, they got &s;ome Rum, and attempted to get more: if they had procured it in Quantity, God knows where this Fury would have ended. And now the Terror of the Night is over, it is &s;aid to be only a Prelude to further Mi&s;cheifs, the Threats again&s;t the Commmi&s;&s;ioners and all the Officers of the Board being renewed with as great Malice as ever.</P>

<P>P. S. June 13. This Morning early I received a Letter from the Commi&s;&s;ioners, informing me of &s;ome Parti|culars from whence they concluded that they were im|mediately expo&s;ed to further Violences, and therefore they on Saturday Evening took Sheltor on Board the Romney Man of War. That it being nece&s;&s;ary to pro|vide for their further Security, they de&s;ire that their Families and Officers may be received, accommodated and protected at the Ca&s;tle, I immediately an&s;wered this, by inclo&s;ing an Order to the Captain of the Ca&s;tle to receive them accordingly.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY my Letter No. 5, I informed your Lord&s;hip of a Riot which happen'd on the 10th of June in the Evening, and that upon my laying the Matter before the Council, they advi&s;ed that &s;uch of the Board as were Ju&s;tices of the Peace &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t me to a&s;certain the Facts, after which the whole &s;hould be taken into Con&s;ideration. I &s;hould have added, that there was then no Apprehen&s;ion in the Council that there would be a Repetition of the&s;e Violences, nor indeed did any &s;uch immediate Danger appear to me whil&s;t I &s;taid in Bo&s;ton which was till Sun&s;et, when I went to my Country Hou&s;e about 4 Miles from Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The next Day being Sunday, I heard &s;ome loo&s;e Reports that there was to be another Ri&s;ing. Early in the Afternoon the Son of Mr. Harri&s;on, the Collector, came to me and &s;aid that his Father apprehended that his Life would be in Danger if he &s;taid in Bo&s;ton, and de&s;ired I would give an Order that he &s;hould be received at the Ca&s;tle I accordingly gave him &s;uch an Order. The next Morning being Monday the 13th, a little after 5 o'Clock, I received a Letter from the Commi&s;&s;ioners, which is mentioned in the P. S. of my la&s;t; a Copy of which, together with my An&s;wer, and my Order to the Commander of the Ca&s;tle, I herewith inclo&s;e; immediately after, I went to Town, and ordered the Coun|cil to be &s;ummoned to meet at Nine o'Clock. Before I went to Council, the Sheriff came to inform me that there was a mo&s;t violent and virulent Paper &s;tuck up upon Liberty Tree, containing an Invitation to the Sons of Liberty to ri&s;e that Night to clear the County of the Commi&s;&s;ioners and their
<PB N="23" REF="011176_0012_0F862BD739680F68">
Officers, to avenge them&s;elves of the Officers of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, one of which was by Name devoted to Death; there were al&s;o &s;ome indecent Threats again&s;t the Governor, if he did not procure the Relea&s;e of the Sloop which was &s;eized. Afternoon as I came to the Town-Hou&s;e where the Council Chamber is, I found &s;everal HandBills which have been cir|culated round the Town, &s;tuck up there; an exact Copy of which follows.</P>

<P>THE Sons of Liberty reque&s;t all tho&s;e who in this Time of Oppre&s;&s;ion and Di&s;traction, wi&s;h well to and would pro|mote the Peace, good Order and Security of the Town and Province; to a&s;&s;emble at Liberty-Hall under Liberty-Tree, on Tue&s;day the 14th In&s;tant, at Ten o'Clock Forenoon preci&s;ely.</P>

<P>When I got into the Council Chamber in the Morning after waiting for a full Board, I told them that there was no Time to enquire of the Particulars of the former Riot which was accidental, when we were immediately threaten'd with new Di&s;turbances premeditated; I therefore laid before them the Informations I had received, and de&s;ired that they would take into Con&s;ideration the Nece&s;&s;ity of providing for the Peace of the Town, and the proper Means of doing it: But notwith&s;tanding all, I could not bring them to any Conclu&s;ion, or even to &s;tate a Que&s;tion. All that was done in the Morn|ing was to cen&s;ure an Expre&s;&s;ion in the Commi&s;&s;ioners Letter, which obliged me to write the Letter the &s;econd of that Date. About One o'Clock they de&s;ired me to adjourn the Council 'till 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, that in the mean Time they might inform them&s;elves of the Probability of new Di&s;tur|bances ari&s;ing.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Printed Paper was laid before the Council; but it was not con&s;idered as an Implication of Danger; neither was the Impropriety of the Sons of Liberty appointing a Meeting to &s;ecure the Peace of the Town, when the Governor and Council were &s;itting upon that Bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;eemingly to little Purpo&s;e, taken much Notice of. I laid be|fore them the Letter of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of that Day; but a Di&s;po&s;ition to cen&s;ure it rather than to an&s;wer it appearing I po&s;tponed the Con&s;ideration of that Letter 'till after the Determination of the main Que&s;tion. Fre&s;h Attempts were made to get rid of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and it was again propo&s;ed,
<PB N="24" REF="011176_0013_0F862BD88D78F598">
as it had been in the Morning, that I &s;hould lay the Bu&s;ine&s;s before the General Court by a Me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es. I called for the Journal of the Hou&s;e, and &s;hewed them that when I pur&s;ued this Method (upon the Stamp-Act Riots) with the Advice of the Council, I was told by the Hou&s;e that it was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Executive Government to quell Riots, and the Legi&s;lature had no Right to interpo&s;e, unle&s;s new Laws were wanted. That there was as much Rea&s;on for them to give the &s;ame An&s;wer now; and I did not care to receive it twice. But the Bias &s;till running this Way, I was obliged to give it up, and leave it to the Council to rai&s;e a Committee of both Hou&s;es to con&s;ider of this Bu&s;ine&s;s, altho' I had many Objections to this Mea&s;ure: But I could not help my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the Cour&s;e of the&s;e Debates, I told them that if this had been the fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Kind, I &s;hould have a&s;ked their Advice, Whether I &s;hould not &s;end to the General for Troops? But having tried it at a Time when there was at lea&s;t as much Danger as now, and found them utterly aver&s;e to it, let the Danger be ever &s;o great and imminent, it would be in vain to repeat the Que&s;tion; however, I was ready to do it, if any one Gentleman would propo&s;e it. I was an|&s;wered, that they did not de&s;ire to be knocked on the Head: I &s;aid that I did not de&s;ire that they or I &s;hould; but I was ready to take my Share of the Danger if they would join with me, tho' I could not alone in &s;o unpopular a Mea&s;ure, for if I did, I mu&s;t quit the Government at lea&s;t for the pre|&s;ent: I added, that tho' I was well a&s;&s;ured, that if I put this Que&s;tion every Gentleman would an&s;wer in the Negative, yet I doubted not but every one would be glad to &s;ee the Peace of the Town re&s;tored by this Method, if it &s;hould appear to be the only one left. No An&s;wer was given.</P>
<P>By the removing this Bu&s;ine&s;s into the General Court, it is taken out of my Hands any further than the final Con&s;ent or Di&s;&s;ent to what &s;hall be &s;ent up to me. It is not with my Approbation, nor entirely to my Di&s;&s;atisfaction; for as I cannot conduct the Bu&s;ine&s;s as it ought to be, it may be be&s;t for me to have little Hand in it.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Come now to give your Lord&s;hip an Account of the Meeting at Liberty-Tree in Pur&s;uance of the printed Notice, a Copy of which I in&s;erted in my la&s;t. Your Lord|&s;hip mu&s;t know that Liberty-Tree is a large Old Elm in the High Street, upon which the Effigies were hung in the Time of the Stamp-Act, and from whence the Mobs at that Time made their Parades. It had &s;ince been adorned with an In|&s;cription, and has obtained the Name of Liberty-Tree, as the Ground under it has that of Liberty-Hall. In Augu&s;t la&s;t, ju&s;t, before the Commencement of the pre&s;ent Troubles, they erected a Flag-Staff, which went through the Tree, and a good deal above the Top of the Tree. Upon this they hoi&s;t a Flag as a Signal for the Sons of Liberty, as they are called; I gave my Lord Shelburne an Account of this Erection at the Time it was made. This Tree has often put me in Mind of Jack Cade's Oak of Reformation.</P>
<P>Upon this Staff the Flag was flying early in the Morning on Tue&s;day; at the Time appointed there were a&s;&s;embled they &s;ay at lea&s;t 4,000 Men, many having come out of the Country for that Purpo&s;e; &s;ome of the principal Gentleman of the Town attended in order to engage the lower People to concur in Mea&s;ures for Peace and Quiet. One of the Select-Men was cho&s;en Moderator or Chairman, when it was found that they could not do Bu&s;ine&s;s there, they adjourned to the Town-Hall. Here it was objected that they were not a legal Meeting; to obviate this, they adjourned to the Afternoon, that in the mean Time the Select-Men might call a Town-Meeting to legali&s;e the A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they met in a large Meeting Hou&s;e, the Town-Hall being not large enough for the Company, and
<PB N="26" REF="011176_0014_0F862BD981D6F668">
Mr. Otis was cho&s;en Moderator. Many wild and violent Propo&s;als were made, but warded off. Among the&s;e were, <Q>that every Captain of a Man of War that came into this Harbour, &s;hould be under the Command of the General Court:</Q> Another was, <Q>that if any Per&s;on &s;hould pro|mote or a&s;&s;i&s;t the bringing troops here, he &s;hould be deemed a Di&s;turber of the Peace, and a Traitor to his Country,</Q> but nothing was done finally but to pa&s;s a Petition to the Governor, and to appoint a Committee of 21 Per&s;ons to Re&s;ort to his Country Hou&s;e (where I then was) and pre&s;ent it to him; and to appoint a Committee to prepare In&s;tructions for their Repre&s;entatives, and a Letter to Mr. DeBerdt, as their Agent, after which they Adjourned to the next Day.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Evening the Committee which was in general very re&s;pectable, attended me in a Train of 11 Chai&s;es: I received them with all po&s;&s;ible Civility, and having heard their Petition, I talked very freely with them upon the Sub|ject, but po&s;tponed giving a formal An&s;wer till the next Day, as it &s;hould be in Writing. I then had Wine handed round, and they left me highly plea&s;ed with their reception, e&s;pe|cially that part of them which had not been u&s;ed to an In|terview with me. The next Day Mr. Otis having received my An&s;wer in Writing, reported the whole, took Notice of the polite Treatment they had received from me, and con|cluded that he really believed that I was a well wi&s;her to the Province: this from him was uncommon and extraordinary. The An&s;wer was univer&s;ally approved, &s;o that ju&s;t at this Time I am popular: Whenever my Duty obliges me to do any Thing which they don't like, there's an end of my po|pularity, and therefore I do not expect to enjoy it a Week. I &s;hould here mention that I am not &s;ure that the Appoint|ment of the Committee for preparing In&s;tructions, &amp;c. which I have mentioned to have been done on the fir&s;t Day, was not on the &s;econd, but it is not material. They then Ad|journed to Friday next in the Afternoon. There was but one Thing mentioned in the Petition that I could do: And that I had promi&s;ed the Select Men 2 Days before that I would do: this was to &s;ettle with Capt. Corner, Command|er of the Romney, a Regulation for impre&s;&s;ing Men, &s;o that it might not hurt the Town. And this I had &s;ettled long before; only there happened to be one &s;ingle Breach of it by an inferior Officer again&s;t his Orders. And indeed the Mob of the Town had lately u&s;ed him and his Officers &s;o very ill, that he was di&s;engaged from any Promi&s;e he had
<PB N="27" REF="011176_0014_0F862BD981D6F668">
made, if he had de&s;ired it. I accordingly went on Board the Romney, attended by three of the Council, and had a full Conference with the Captain, in which he acted with the utmo&s;t Candor and good Nature, and after recapitulating the Injuries he and his Officers had received, renewed the Engagement concerning pre&s;&s;ing, and profe&s;&s;ed a De&s;ire of making that Service agreeable to the Town. In the Afternoon I went to the Council, and having &s;ent for the Select Men, I reported to them what had pa&s;&s;ed with the Captain, and after having &s;hown them how much it was the Intere&s;t of the Town to cultivate a good Under&s;tanding with the Commanders of the King's Ships, I exhorted them to u&s;e their Influence over the Common People, &s;o as to di&s;|po&s;e them to treat the Captain, his Officers and Men, in &s;uch a Manner as might procure his favour, at lea&s;t avert his Re|&s;entment: And one of the Gentlemen who accompanied me, engaged to attend the Town Meeting and Report what had pa&s;&s;ed at this Interview as of his own Accord, it being not thought proper that the Governor and Council &s;hould appear to have any Corre&s;pondence with a Meeting &s;o originated and compo&s;ed as this was.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 18<HI>th,</HI> 1768.</P>
<P>I am able now to proceed in my Narrative of the Town Meeting. Ye&s;terday in the Afternoon they met according to their Adjournment. The Gentleman of the Council who had engaged to report our proceedings with Capt. Corner, did it in &s;uch a manner as gave great Satisfaction both in re|gard to me and the Captain. But no Me&s;&s;age was voted either to me or Captain Corner; to me it was needle&s;s, but to him requi&s;ite, as they have in a manner interdicted him and his Officers of the Town. All they did was to in|&s;truct their Repre&s;entatives; the only In&s;truction I hear of is, to enquire if any Per&s;ons have been Writing for the King's Ships or Troops to come here, and who? that they might be di&s;tingui&s;hed as Enemies to their Country. They broke up quietly, and there is an End of the Meeting.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners and their Families, and Officers are &s;till on Board the Romney, where they proceed in their Bu&s;ine&s;s. The Town won't hear of their return to Bo&s;ton; and it is much better that they &s;hould not until the Que&s;tion is determined. I hear that they are to fix their Re&s;idence at the Ca&s;tle next Monday. The Romney is fell down and now <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">es off the Ca&s;tle towards the Town; there is a Sloop <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of 16 Guns ju&s;t come in, which being &s;tationed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

the other &s;ide the Ca&s;tle, will complete the command of all the approaches to the Ca&s;tle, there are al&s;o other Ships of War expected in, &s;o that the retreat of the Commi&s;&s;ioners has been very timely and very well circum&s;tanced, and their &s;ecurity is now effectually provided for. Your Lord&s;hip may wonder at my dwelling upon this: but if there is not a Re|volt, the Leaders of the Sons of Liberty mu&s;t fal&s;ify their Words, and change their Purpo&s;es. For my Part, when I con&s;ider the defencele&s;s State of this Town, I cannot think they will be &s;o mad as to attempt to defend it again&s;t the King's Forces: But the Lengths they have gone alrea|dy are &s;carce &s;hort of Madne&s;s.

<P>I HAVE the Honor to receive your Lord&s;hip's Letters No. 6 &amp; 7, together with the Duplicates, &amp;c. inclo&s;ed in the Cover of the fir&s;t. Upon the Receipt of them I con&s;ulted the Lieutenant-Governor and the Secretary about the be&s;t Manner of excepting the Orders contained in No. 7, and we all agreed that it would be be&s;t to &s;tay till the Town-Meetings, continued by Adjournments, were over, and the People a little compo&s;ed.

<P>I cannot fore&s;ee what will be done upon this Occa&s;ion, whether Prudence will get the better of Faction, or not, I know not how to hope that they will comply; if they do not your Lord&s;hip may depend upon it I will obey my Orders. It happens very lucky that I am at pre&s;ent &s;een in a very favourable Light by the People, and that may prevent my being charged as the Author or Advi&s;er of this Mea&s;ure, as at other Times I &s;hould certainly be.

<P>However, I &s;han't put too great Confidence in them: I &s;hall act with all proper Caution; and if I find my&s;elf ob|liged to Di&s;&s;olve the A&s;&s;embly, I &s;hall end the Se&s;&s;ion by Prorogation, and Di&s;&s;olve them by Proclamation. By the&s;e Means the Shock will become gradual; and I &s;hall be able to &s;tep out of the Way 'till the Wonder is over. Indeed I intended when this Se&s;&s;ion was over, to take a little Relaxa|tion; as I find the Multiplicity of Bu&s;ine&s;s of late, and the Attention which the Importance of it has obliged me to give to it, has impaired my Health.</P>

He &s;aid that the King appointed none but Boys for his Mini&s;ters; that they had no Education but travelling through France, from whence they returned full of the &s;lavi&s;h Principles of that Country; that they knew nothing of Bu&s;ine&s;s when they came into their Offices, and did not &s;tay long enough in them to ac|quire that little Knowlege which is gained from Experience; that all Bu&s;ine&s;s was really done by the Clerks, and even they were too frequently changed to under&s;tand what they were about; that the People in England did not know what the Rights of Engli&s;hmen were; that there was not a Per|&s;on in England capable of compo&s;ing &s;o elegant, &s;o pure, and &s;o nervous a Writing as the Petition to the King which pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I give your Lord&s;hip a Specimen of this Rhap&s;ody; and it was remarked that in his general Cen&s;ure of the Admi|ni&s;tration of the King's Government, no Exception was made of the Mini&s;ters who favoured America by the Repeal of the Stamp-Act, and by other Indulgencies, by the Abu&s;e where|of this very Faction has ro&s;e to this Head: all were involved in one common Obloquy. I quote the&s;e Sayings from the Months of tho&s;e who heard them delivered in the Hou&s;e, which was laid quite open, both Doors and Gallery upon this Occa&s;ion, but neither they nor I can pretend to Exactne&s;s of Words, but the Sub&s;tance. I dare &s;ay, does not vary materially. In another Part of his Speech, he pa&s;&s;ed an Encomium on Oliver Cromwell, and extolled the Times pre|ceding his Advancement, and particularly the Murder of the King. The Re&s;ult was the appointing a Committee to take the Me&s;&s;age, &amp;c. into Con&s;ideration, which Committee con|&s;i&s;ted intirely of the mo&s;t violent of the Heads of the Faction, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Repre&s;entative&s; of the Town of Bo&s;ton, and three of tho&s;e whom I had re&s;i&s;ted to admit into the Council upon Account of their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> by their &s;omenting

the Troubles of the Government, with two others: thus the Hou&s;e &s;eemed to prejudge this Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Appoint|ment of the Committee; and indeed the Appointment of a Committee at all &s;hewed a Di&s;po&s;ition rather to agree than &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day Morning June 23d, upon an Application from the Committee, a Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to me de&s;ir|ing Copies of my In&s;tructions upon this Occa&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">II.</NOTE> of your Lord&s;hip's Letter (of which I had given an Extract) and of a Letter of your Lord&s;hip's No. 6, which I had communicated to the Council, and Copies of my Letters to your Lord&s;hip upon the Subject. The next Morn|ing (June 24) I returned an An&s;wer with a Copy of the 5th and 6th Paragraphs of the Letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">III.</NOTE> which concluded the whole. In my An&s;wer I caution them to provide for the Tax Bill; I had a Hint given me that they intended to omit that Bu&s;ine&s;s, on Purpo&s;e to oblige me, in Ca&s;e I di&s;&s;olved this A&s;&s;embly, by popular Clamour and real Inconvenience, to call another A&s;&s;embly immediately after, which I by no Means think proper, nor my&s;elf to be at Liberty &s;o to do. I therefore thought proper to counter|work this Intention.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 28.</P>
<P>SINCE the former Date I have been obliged to keep Watch upon the Proceedings of the Hou&s;e, having been told that the very Rever&s;e of di&s;avowing the Proceedings of the late Hou&s;e is preparing. They have been much elated within the&s;e 3 or 4 Days by &s;ome Letters they have received in An&s;wer to the circular Letter. I &s;hall inclo&s;e printed Copies of what have been publi&s;hed in the Papers here. I am told that there is al&s;o a circular Letter from the A&s;&s;embly of Virginia arrived; I had it from a Gentleman who &s;aid he &s;aw it at Rhode-I&s;land. If it is other than the Letter from Virginia now publi&s;hed, they keep it &s;ecret here, but I &s;hall &s;oon have a Copy of it. I keep a Look-out in the Hou&s;e, that if upon the Report of the Committee they &s;hould move for another Congre&s;s (as&mdash;in his Speech &s;aid, he hoped would &s;oon take Place) or another circular Letter, or any Thing that contravenes his Maje&s;ty's Requi&s;ition, I &s;hall immediately put a Stop to their Proceedings without waiting for an An&s;wer in Form. For which purpo&s;e to bring this Mat|ter to a Cri&s;is as &s;oon as may be, after having watched their Motions all this Morning. I put a Me&s;&s;age in the Secretary's Hands to be delivered to them this After|noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">IV.</NOTE> as in the inclo&s;ed Copy.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="011176_0017_0F862BDD275FA2B8">
<HI>July</HI> 1.</P>
<P>On the next Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">V.</NOTE> June 29&punc; the Hou&s;e &s;ent me a Me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring me to grant them a Rece&s;s, that they might con&s;ult their Con&s;tituents re&s;pecting the Requi|&s;ition. I knew that &s;uch an Indulgence would be liable to great Abu&s;e; but if I had thought it could have produced any good Effect, which I had not any Rea&s;on to expect, I did not think my&s;elf at Liberty to po&s;tpone the Con&s;ideration of this important Que&s;tion. I therefore returned an immediate An&s;wer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">VI.</NOTE> that I could not con&s;i&s;tently, with my Sen&s;e of my Duty, prorogue or adjourn the Court until I had received an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The next Morning I went early to the Council to watch the Proceedings of the Hou&s;e, having been informed that they intended to originate an Invitation for another Congre&s;s: in which Ca&s;e the Moment I got Intelli|gence of it, intended to Di&s;&s;olve them. The Hou&s;e kept them&s;elves locked up all the Morning, the be&s;t Part of which was &s;pent in preparing a Letter to your Lord&s;hip, which I am told is very lengthy; but as I have not &s;een it, and probably &s;hall not be allowed a Sight of it 'till it is printed in the News-Papers, I will &s;ay no more of it than that I am told that it is in the old Strain, complaining that they have been mi&s;repre&s;ented; though the pre&s;ent Cen&s;ure ari&s;es from an Act of theirs, which they have had circulated throughout his Maje&s;ty's Dominions. They then put the Que&s;tion, "Re&s;cind or not Re&s;cind," which was de|termined in the Negative, 91 to 17: Among the Majority were many Members who were &s;carce ever known upon any other Occa&s;ion to vote again&s;t the Government-&s;ide of a Que&s;tion, &s;o greatly has Infatuation and Intimidation gained ground. They then &s;ettled the An&s;wer to be given to me, and appointed a Committee to deliver it. After this, a Motion was made to appoint a Committee to prepare an Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, to de&s;ire him to remove the Governor, and ap|point another <HI>more agreeable</HI> to the People: This was carri|ed by a Majority of 5, and with this ended the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Morning.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome Doubts with my&s;elf, whether I ought not to di&s;mi&s;s the A&s;&s;embly, immediately after I knew for certain that the Hou&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed a Vote again&s;t Re&s;cinding. But upon a little Recollection, I thought it be&s;t to wait 'till re|ceived their An&s;wer, as I was not obliged to take Notice of this Vote, 'till it was notified to me in Form. In this I was
<PB N="33" REF="011176_0017_0F862BDD275FFA2B8">
influenced by a Con&s;ideration re&s;pecting my&s;elf: The Hou&s;e had appointed a Committee to prepare an Addre&s;s to get me removed: If I had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them in a ha&s;ty unformal Way, whil&s;t this Bu&s;ine&s;s was on the Carpet, it would have been &s;aid that I was afraid of the Enquiry. Whereas this is the third Time the Faction has moved to impeach me; the two former Times they had been obliged to give it up for want of Materials; and I was &s;ure that they had acquired none &s;ince their la&s;t Attempt of this Kind. And this Motion ended in the &s;ame Manner as the two former; after having endeavoured for two Hours together in the Afternoon to cook up &s;omething to found this Application on, and finding that I would not interrupt them in it, as I believe they expected and de&s;ired that I &s;hould, they were obliged to give it up them&s;elves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">VII.</NOTE> Upon this the An&s;wer which had all this while been detained, was &s;ent up to the Council Chamber, where I received it. Immediately after which I &s;ent up for the Hou&s;e, and Prorogued the General Court, intending to Di&s;&s;olve it by Proclamation.</P>
<P>Upon this Occa&s;ion there happened a Fracas in the Coun|cil &s;udden and unfore&s;een, but what probably will be improved by the Faction for their own Purpo&s;es. It &s;eems that the Evening before the Council had appointed a Committee to con&s;ider the State of the Province; which Committee had prepared an Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty concerning the late Du|ties, to be reported to the Board. I had all along declared that I &s;hould di&s;mi&s;s the General Court immediately upon receiving the An&s;wer from the Hou&s;e; I knew nothing of any Bu&s;ine&s;s being undone, not being acquainted with this; I had ordered the Secretary to prepare for the Prorogation by laying the Acts which had pa&s;&s;ed that Se&s;&s;ion on the Table, their Titles being to be read in the Pre&s;ence of the whole Court as has been my U&s;age; and the Acts were accordingly laid in Order. Whil&s;t I was thus waiting to receive the An&s;wer of the Hou&s;e, the Committee of the Board introduced this Addre&s;s: I te&s;tified my Surprize upon the Occa&s;ion, and ob&s;erved that they could not expect to go through that Bu&s;in|ne&s;s at that Time. Pre&s;ently after the Committee from the Hou&s;e attended; they were admitted and delivered their An|&s;wer. As &s;oon as that was done, I ordered the Secretary to call up the Hou&s;e; as &s;oon as the Hou&s;e entered, one of the Committee of the Council expo&s;tulated with me upon my call|ing up the Hou&s;e whil&s;t the Council was proceeding on the Addre&s;s, and was &s;o indecent as to appeal to the Hou&s;e. I
<PB N="34" REF="011176_0018_0F882BDDF4C7D7O">
&s;ilenced him: Another Gentleman interpo&s;ed; I &s;topt him al&s;o, and proceeded to the Prorogation.</P>
<P>When the Hou&s;e was gone out of the Council Chamber, I expo&s;tulated with the&s;e Gentlemen upon the Interruption they had given me, in the Pre&s;ence of the Hou&s;e, in executing his Maje&s;ty's po&s;itive Commands. I told them that I &s;hould have thought my&s;elf blameable, if I had &s;uffered 5 Minutes to in|tervene between receiving the An&s;wer and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the Hou&s;e; for I &s;hould have made my&s;elf an&s;werable for all they did in the Interval. This Proceeding could not be ju&s;tified and was really condemned by &s;ome other of the Council, and was in &s;ome Mea&s;ure apologized for; but it will not be in the Power of the Apologizers to prevent an ill U&s;e being made of it. I then informed the Council that I had no De|&s;ire to &s;top any Repre&s;entation which they wanted to make to the King, if it was conceived in decent and re&s;pectful Terms, as it &s;eemed to me, from hearing it read, this was. I therefore would let them introduce this into the privy Coun|cil; and if it appeared to be inoffen&s;ive, I would lay it be|fore his Maje&s;ty, though I &s;hould not agree with them in Opinion as to all their A&s;&s;ertions, as I pointed out &s;ome, where I &s;hould not. But this was not enough: It &s;eems that when the Addre&s;s was pa&s;t, there was a Petition to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and another to the Hou&s;e of Commons to be bro't in. I told them I could have nothing to do with them; I could not pretend to commnnicate with tho&s;e great Bodies; my Corre&s;pondence went no higher than his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters. After &s;ome Altercation, they &s;ubmitted to this, and were content with the Addre&s;s being brought into the privy Coun|cil, after it had received my Approbation. This compromi&s;e was very expedient to obviate the Mi&s;repre&s;entations, which this Bu&s;ine&s;s would otherwi&s;e be &s;ubject to.</P>
<P>Having carried my Narrative to this Length, I mu&s;t &s;u&s;|pend my Reflections upon the&s;e Events unto a farther Op|portunity. I will however here ob&s;erve that it may be &s;ug|ge&s;ted that I have not conducted this Bu&s;ine&s;s with Spirit; but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved to what a Weakne&s;s this Govern|ment is reduced, which makes the mo&s;t gentle Way of do|ing any Bu&s;ine&s;s the mo&s;t adviseable. I never intended to depart from his Maje&s;ty's Orders in the lea&s;t; but upon many Accounts I thought it be&s;t to di&s;&s;olve by Proclamation; and &s;uch Proclamation is already &s;igned, and bears Date the Day after the Prorogation. It was &s;aid, that it was well that I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them by Prorogation, and not by Di&s;&s;olution;
<PB N="35" REF="011176_0018_0F862BDDF4C7D70">
why, I don't know: But if any Triumph ari&s;es from it, it will be but &s;hort-lived; for the Di&s;&s;olution will be publi&s;h|ed in the Papers at the &s;ame Time with the Prorogation.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE the fir&s;t beginning of the Troubles of this Town to the pre&s;ent Time, I have frequently repre&s;ented to your Lord&s;hip's Office the Impracticability of my applying for Troops, either for the Support of the Authority of the Government, or the Power of the Magi&s;tracy; both of which have been continually in&s;ulted and made contemptible for near three years pa&s;t. The great Difficulty, which has attended this Mea&s;ure, has been, that I could by no Means get the Council to advi&s;e or concur in it, and neither by the due Con&s;ideration of my In&s;tructions and the Rules of other Governments, nor by the Forms of this Government, where the Governor is more connected with, and re&s;trained by the Council, than in the Governments which are merely royal, did I think my&s;elf authorized to introduce Troops into a Town not u&s;ed to them, upon my own Opinion only, and contrary to that of the Council, who I am directed to con|&s;ult and advi&s;e with in all Matters of Importance. And I have never imagined, that it would be expected of me that I &s;hould &s;eperate my&s;elf from the Council upon this Occa&s;ion, and make my&s;elf &s;olely an&s;werable for the Con&s;equences of the introducing Troops here, or the not introducing them, e&s;pecially as I have always under&s;tood that, &s;ince the Repeal of the Stamp-Act, the Intention of the Admini&s;tration was, that all Appearance of forcible and compul&s;ive Mea&s;ures &s;hould be avoided; and as I have con&s;tantly &s;ent Home Ac|counts of all Occurrences which could Influence this Que&s;tion. I have concluded that a Change of Mea&s;ures mu&s;t originate at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and that the fir&s;t Orders for quartering Troops at Bo&s;ton would come from thence.</P>
<P>In my Letter to the Earl of Shelburne, No. 8, of this Year, Par. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, I treat this Subject particularly as it relates to
<PB N="36" REF="011176_0019_0F862BDE84D365B8">
the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms. In my Letter to your Lord&s;hip, No. 6, which gives an Account of the Riot on June 10th, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners leaving the Town. I inform of what pa&s;&s;ed between me and the Council concerning &s;ending for Troops, from which it will appear to what little Purpo&s;e it is to put a Que&s;tion upon that Subject to the Council. However, this Bu&s;ine&s;s is now brought to &s;uch a Cri&s;is, that I could no longer avoid putting &s;uch Que&s;tion in Form: It has become nece&s;&s;ary to my own Ju&s;tification, and acquitting me of the Con&s;equences, if any Bad &s;hould ari&s;e of this Town remaining de&s;titute of Troops, and to give an Account of this Tran&s;action is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Letter.</P>
<P>On the 2d of July I received a Letter from General Gage, with two Packets for Col. Dalrymple at Halifax inclo&s;ed, informing me that he had received an Account of the Tu|mults at Bo&s;ton, and had &s;ent an Order to the Commanding Officer at Halifax for Troops, if they were wanted at Bo&s;ton. I &s;ent both Letters away, and wrote to General Gage, &s;etting forth the Rea&s;ons why I could not apply for Troops, but that I had &s;ent the Letters forward; for tho 'I thought it improper for me to require Troops, it was full as improper for me to prevent their coming if they were otherwi&s;e or|dered. In An&s;wer to this the General has &s;ent me a Copy of the Letter to Col. Dalrymple, by which I am informed that the Orders to him are only to collect the Troops toge|ther, but not to embark them till they are required by me. I have thereupon wrote to the General, that if the Troops are not to move from Halifax till I require them, they are like to continue there. For I cannot think it proper for me to make &s;uch a Requi&s;ition, without the Advice of Council, and there was no Probability of my obtaining &s;uch Advice; however, I would lay it before the Council. I have been le&s;s explicit on the&s;e Letters, as I &s;hall inclo&s;e Copies of them.</P>
<P>On Saturday July 23d I held a Council, where having in Part opened the Matters I had for their Con&s;ideration, they advi&s;ed, that in Regard to the Importance of the Bu&s;ine&s;s I would order all of the Council who lived within a Days Journey of Bo&s;ton, to be &s;ummoned to meet on the Wedne&s;|day following, and the Council to be adjourned till then. On Wedne&s;day the 27th there were fourteen met; and we proceeded to Bu&s;ine&s;s that Day and Friday following. As the Minutes of the Council are extended more than ordina|rily, they will be &s;ufficient to explain, what was done: There
<PB N="37" REF="011176_0019_0F862BDE84D365B8">
was &s;ome Altercation that was &s;carce worth remembring, but I am obliged to take Notice that I ob&s;erved with con|vern, that the popular Spirit upon this Occa&s;ion &s;hewed it|&s;elf higher in the Council than I had known it heretofore, and my endeavouring to moderate it, &s;ubjected me to Treat|ment different from what I have been u&s;ed of late to receive from that Board. But the&s;e Con&s;iderations are more pro|per for another Time and Place.</P>
<P>I &s;hall inform General Gage of the Re&s;ult of this Council, by which all Expectation of Troops coming to Bo&s;ton until Orders arrive from England is over. Perhaps if no great Mi&s;chief is done in the mean Time it may be much better for them to be ordered from England than to be brought here by the Order or Requi&s;ition of any one in America, as they will be introduced in a Manner much more authorita|tive. For my Part, I have acted herein for the be&s;t, accord|ing to my Judgment. I could not require Troops again&s;t the Opinion of the Council, without making my&s;elf an Ob|ject of popular Re&s;entment, which would probably, if it had produced no wor&s;e Effects, have obliged me to quit the Government. Now, my Lord, as I have no Leave of Ab|&s;ence to ju&s;tify my Departure, I mu&s;t have &s;tay'd till I was drove out by Force or apparent Danger. And if &s;uch an Event had happened, how could I have ju&s;tified my&s;elf in doing an Act with a Doubt of the Regularity of it, and a Fore&s;ight of it's ill Con&s;equences, which &s;hould produce &s;uch a Convul&s;ion in the State as obliging a Governor to quit his Po&s;t?</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from Governor Bernard to the Earl of Hill&s;borough, dated Bo&s;ton, 9th July, 1768.</HEAD>
<P>I Gave your Lord&s;hip a full account of the i&s;&s;ue of the pro|ceedings upon His Maje&s;ty's requi&s;ition, together with Copies of all Papers relating thereto. I &s;ent the original by a returned Expre&s;s to General Gage, to be forwarded by the Packet. The Duplicates I put into the hands of Capt. Smith, of the Brig&mdash;, which &s;ailed la&s;t Monday for Gla&s;gow. As there are other Ships now preparing to &s;ail, I &s;hall inclo&s;e &s;ome printed Copies of the Papers from the News-Papers, &s;ome of which may come to your Lord&s;hip's hands before either of my Letters. From the&s;e your Lord|&s;hip will &s;ee that I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the General Court by Proroga|tion, and Di&s;&s;olved them the next Day by Proclamation. This form of Proceeding&punc; tho' immaterial in the Effect, made this Bu&s;ine&s;s pa&s;s more ea&s;ily than I expected.</P>
<P>The Sons of Liberty keep up their Spirits &s;till: on Tue&s;|day Evening la&s;t pa&s;t, a number of them between 50 and 60, went out of Bo&s;ton at the clo&s;e of the Day, and having di|vided them&s;elves into two Parties, met on each &s;ide of an Hou&s;e in Roxbury, about three Miles from Bo&s;ton, which Mr. Robin&s;on, one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms has lately hired, with an intention, as is &s;uppo&s;ed from the Ma|noevre they practiced, to &s;urprize him there and prevent his e&s;cape. But he being at the Ca&s;tle, where he had re&s;ided &s;ince the Commi&s;&s;ioners have been driven thither for &s;afety, they did nothing but plunder his Fruit Trees, and break off the Branches thereof, and break down &s;ome of the Fences, and trample down the Garden, and did not, that I can learn, break into the Hou&s;e. After this, about Midnight, they went back to Bo&s;ton in a Body huzzaing all the Way. This is called a Frolick of a few Boys to Eat &s;ome Cherries.</P>
<P>La&s;t Night about 30 Men came on Board a Schooner ly|ing at a Wharf, which had been &s;eized for having Thirty Hog&s;heads of uncu&s;tomed Mola&s;&s;es on Board, and was then in the Cu&s;tody of two Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers, and having confined the two Officers to the Cabbin, carried off all the Mola&s;&s;es. When the Sloop was &s;eized which occa&s;ioned the
<PB N="39" REF="011176_0020_0F862BDFC9136128">
Riot in which the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers were ill treated, &amp; in Con&s;equence of which the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms were obliged to leave the Town, the greate&s;t part of the Re&s;ent|ment was expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t carrying the Sloop from the Wharf and putting her under the Care of the Man of War. This, they &s;aid, was an affront to the Town, as it contained an in&s;inuation that the Sloop would not have been &s;afe if it had been left at the Wharf in the Cu&s;tody of a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officer. Therefore when this Schooner was &s;eized, it was left at the Wharf under no other guard but 2 Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers. It would have been very ea&s;ily &s;ecured by laying it in the Stream, and putting a Guard on Board, either from the Romney or the Ca&s;tle; but I &s;uppo&s;e it was tho't be&s;t to try the Experiment. As every Seizure made or at|tempted to be made on Land at Bo&s;ton, for three Years pa&s;t, before the&s;e two In&s;tances, has been violently re&s;cued or prevented, it was ea&s;y to &s;ee what would be the Event of this, and I foretold it was certain. However, the Experiment has been made.</P>
<P>I have not received any Reque&s;t from the Commi&s;&s;ioners upon this Occa&s;ion, nor do I expect it: for they know I can do nothing. Your Lord&s;hip has ob&s;erved in my Letters No. 5 &amp; 6, that I con&s;ulted the Council upon the great Riot on June 10th, and after having, upon repeated Adjournments, endeavoured to bring them to &s;ome Re&s;olution, the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s was avoided by referring it to the General Court. After this a Committee of both Hou&s;es was appointed under the &s;pecious Title "To take the State of the Province into Con&s;ideration," when after &s;everal Meetings, as the two Bo|dies had different Purpo&s;es to &s;erve, they could come to no Conclu&s;ion. And &s;o this Matter re&s;ts: And I have no De|&s;ire to revive it again; as, in the pre&s;ent State of Things, the Advice of the Council will be timid, and the Executive Power of the Governor is perfectly impotent.</P>
<P>In Regard to the An&s;wer of the Hou&s;e, &s;o far as it relates to me, I will make but one Ob&s;ervation upon it: It is Felo de &s;e of its own Purport; it pretends to be the Voice of the People, and gives Evidence it&s;elf that is the Voice of a Faction. It charges the Governor with mi&s;repre&s;enting the Generality of the People, by a&s;&s;erting that the blameable Conduct of the Hou&s;e is to be imputed to a Faction prevailing there, and not to the People in general. Now if this is not true&punc; all the Injury the Governor has done the People, is by &s;etting them in a more favourable Light than they de&s;erved
<PB N="40" REF="011176_0021_0F862BDFE7E0CD20">
and therefore if the People wore to take Notice of it, there would be no Occa&s;ion for Pa&s;&s;ion or Re&s;entment. But it is otherwi&s;e with the Faction: if they are charged with more than belongs to them, it is natural that they &s;hould re&s;ent it: and therefore Pa&s;&s;ion, Malice and Abu&s;e become them, and are &s;uitable to their Character and the Occa&s;ion. From this Criterion, one may &s;afely pronounce that this An&s;wer is the violent Overflowing of a Faction, and not the cool Voice of a People. And yet my Lord, I do not intend to give up my Opinion of the Faction or the People, notwith&s;tanding the high Pitch to which the Wickedne&s;s of the former has rai&s;ed the Inflamation and Infatuation of a great Part of the latter.</P>
<P>I have been under &s;ome Concern for the Safety of the Ca&s;tle &s;ince the Commi&s;&s;ioners retired thither, not upon Ac|count of any Intelligence I had of an Intention to attack it, (for that at mo&s;t amounted but to idle Rumours) as from a Con&s;ideration of the Weakne&s;s of the Garri&s;on, and the Ea&s;e with which it might be &s;urprized. But I am relieved in this by the Care of Commodore Hood, who has &s;o well &s;up|plied us with Naval Force, that there are now about the Ca&s;tle one Fifty Gun Ship, two Sloops of 16 Guns, and two Cutters armed with Swivel Guns; &s;o that I am under no Concern for that Place. Be&s;ides I have lately received by Expre&s;s from General Gage &s;ome Di&s;patches for Colonel Dalrymple at Halifax, which I forwarded by one of the King's Cutters, and I am mi&s;taken if there is not among them an Order for at lea&s;t one Regiment to come here; altho' General Gage, who knows my Situation, where Death is publickly denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who are con|cerned in bringing Troops here, is &s;o kind as to conceal the Contents of the Di&s;patches from Me. One Regiment will &s;ecure the Ca&s;tle, but will not be &s;ufficient to awe the Town. This very Morning the Select Men of the Town ordered the Magazine of Arms belonging to the Town to be brought out to be cleaned, when they were expo&s;ed for &s;ome Hours at the Town-Hou&s;e. They were expo&s;tulated with for this im|prudent act; they excu&s;ed them&s;elves by &s;aying, that tho&s;e Arms were ordered to be cleaned <HI>two</HI> Months ago. I have been much pre&s;&s;ed to go to the Ca&s;tle, when Troops &s;hall ar|rive here. I do not choo&s;e to &s;hew a want of Re&s;olution as I don't feel the firmne&s;s of my Mind to fail, but I &s;hall not unnece&s;&s;arily expo&s;e my&s;elf to Danger where I can fore&s;ee it.

<P>I FIND my&s;elf obliged to add a Supplement to my Letter No. 10. which I &s;ent away To-day, by a Brig for Li|verpool, the Duplicate whereof will be inclo&s;ed with this. I had there informed your Lord&s;hip that 30 Hog&s;heads of Mola&s;&s;es which had been &s;eized for illicit Trade, together with the Schooner it was in, had been taken from thence out of the Cu&s;tody of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers who had the Care of it. This very Mola&s;&s;es was on the next Day return|ed and put on Board the Schooner again. The Account I have of this Affair is this: The People of the Town were di&s;&s;atisfied, that the A&s;&s;urances which they had made, that the Sloop which had been &s;eized before this, and put in the Cu&s;tody of the Man of War, would have been &s;afe if &s;he had been left at the Wharf in the Care of a Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officer, &s;hould be &s;o &s;oon fal&s;ified. The Selectmen of the Town therefore &s;ent for the Ma&s;ter of this Schooner, and upon his denying that he knew any Thing of the Mola&s;&s;es, told him that would not pa&s;s: For Nobody would take away his Mo|la&s;&s;es without his Privity; they thereupon ordered him to return the Mola&s;&s;es directly, under Pain of the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Town; which was immediately done. I dare &s;ay, nei|ther the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers, nor the Judge of the Admiralty, nor the Chief Ju&s;tice, nor the Governor, could have prevailed upon any one to run the Ri&s;k of informing where this Mo|la&s;&s;es was conveyed, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t in recovering it, if it had been again&s;t the Houmour of the People. But to &s;erve a Purpo&s;e of the People, the Select-Men in a &s;ummary Way can do this Bu&s;ine&s;s in a Trice. So we are not without a Govern|ment, only it is in the Hands of the People of the Town, and not of tho&s;e deputed by the King or under his Authority.</P>

<P>BY My Letter, No. 9, I informed your Lord&s;hip that at the Time I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the A&s;&s;embly, the Council was beginning to proceed upon a Petition to his Maje&s;ty, which Proceeding was interrupted by the Prorogation of the Gene|ral Court&punc; and that to take away all Pretence to charge me with intending to &s;top any Repre&s;entation which they want|ed to make to the King, I gave them Leave to proceed in this Bu&s;ine&s;s in the privy Council; and if the Petition was conceived in decent and re&s;pectful Terms, I promi&s;ed to &s;ub|mit the &s;ame to be laid before his Maje&s;ty, altho' I &s;hould not entirely agree with them upon the Subject-Matter.</P>
<P>I have now the Honour to tran&s;mit the Petition inclo&s;ed to your Lord&s;hip, and de&s;ire the favour that you would be plea&s;ed to lay the &s;ame before His Maje&s;ty for His mo&s;t gracious Con&s;ideration. I am not a Party in it, nor could I think it proper that I &s;hould be: and therefore this Ad|dre&s;s is not quite regular in Point of Form. But your Lord&s;hip will con&s;ider the Circum&s;tances before-mentioned, that it originated in the Legi&s;lative Council, altho' it was not compleated there, and will receive it as an Act of that Body to which the Concurrence of the Governor is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will ob&s;erve that I am de&s;ired to recom|mend the Prayer of the Petition. I have been always tender in expre&s;&s;ing my Di&s;approbation of Acts of Parliament, and was &s;o e&s;pecially in a Ca&s;e where I thought the Act had better have been &s;pared. But I can readily recommend that Part of the Petition which prays Relief again&s;t &s;uch Acts as are made for the Purpo&s;e of drawing a Revenue from the Colonies. For they are &s;o little able to bear the drawing

<P>I HAVE now an Opportunity of &s;ending your Lord&s;hip a printed Copy of the Letter of the Hou&s;e to your Lord|&s;hip; the Di&s;pute concerning publi&s;hing it having only de|layed it for a Week. As it is profe&s;&s;edly intended for the People more than for your Lord&s;hip, &s;o it is accompanied with Comments much more calculated to prepare the People to re&s;ent the Di&s;allowance of their Preten&s;ions than to induce your Lord&s;hip to endeavour to procure an Allowance of them.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw this Letter 'till it was in print: I find nothing in it that requires my An&s;wer. I am abu&s;ed upon a Sup|po&s;ition of my having mi&s;repre&s;ented them in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the circular Letter: I have looked over my Letters upon this Subject, and find nothing in them which is not admitted in the Letter to your Lord&s;hip. I never &s;aid that there was a thiner Hou&s;e when the Circular Letter pa&s;&s;ed than when it was rejected. I &s;aid that the Way was prepared for this &s;econd Vote by tampering with &amp; influencing Particulars; this was as notorious as that there was a Hou&s;e. There was another Rea&s;on for this contradictory Vote, which I did not a&s;&s;ign, that although the Number of the Hou&s;e was the &s;ame, yet it con&s;i&s;ted of many different Per&s;ons, which as the Number was le&s;s than two Thirds of the whole, and there was a Fortnight intervening between the two Votes, may be ea&s;ily conceived. The highe&s;t Charge again&s;t them, the era&s;ing the Journals of the Hou&s;e to &s;erve this Purpo&s;e, they admit: this &s;urely is a very <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ju&s;tifiable Proceeding.</P>
<P>The general Charge again&s;t me for Mi&s;repre&s;enting them is fal&s;e, and has not been &s;upported by any one In&s;tance. It has been my Mi&s;fortune to be Governor of this Province during a Time, when the mo&s;t favourable Repre&s;entation of the Proceedings of the A&s;&s;emblies, and the Doings of
<PB N="44" REF="011176_0023_0F862BE168203780">
the People mu&s;t occa&s;ion his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;plea&s;ure. Before this Time I &s;carce ever met the A&s;&s;embly without receiving from them Te&s;timonials of their Approbation of my Conduct. For the&s;e three Years pa&s;t it has been impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile the Duty of the Governor with plea&s;ing the People; and it would have been &s;o, if a Man of greater Ability than I pre|tend to, had been in my Place. Nothing le&s;s than a general Sacrifice of the Rights of the Sovereign State can make a Governor popular in this Place at this Time.</P>
<P>I &s;hall continue writing to your Lord&s;hip until I have communicated all I think nece&s;&s;ary for your Lord&s;hip's In|formation. When that will be, God knows. My Ideas are become too numerous and exten&s;ive for writing, and are fitter for a Conferrence than a Series of Letters. My Letter, as intended upon the Subject of calling another A&s;&s;embly, will be lengthy, comprehen&s;ive and important, but it does not require Ha&s;te as yet. The News-Papers which I inclo&s;e contain a Variety of Sedition and Calumny, be&s;ides that which the Letter di&s;pen&s;es.</P>

<P>THE dangerous State which this Government is in, makes it nece&s;&s;ary for me to acquaint your Lord&s;hip of every little Di&s;turbance which happens here, as one can|not fore&s;ee the Tendency of any of the Movements of the Sons of Liberty, and mu&s;t expect the wor&s;t Con&s;equences from each of them.</P>
<P>I &s;ent your Lord&s;hip a Copy of a Paper &s;tuck up in the Town Hou&s;e, inviting the Sons of Liberty upon Mr. Wil|liams (one of the In&s;pectors of the Cu&s;toms) his return to Town, to make him re&s;ign his Office or quit the Town. Mr. Williams returned from the Circuit about the Middle of la&s;t Week. On Friday la&s;t an Attack upon his Hou&s;e was planned: and to effect it, according to a preconcerted &s;ignal, they rung the Fire-Bells, and cried out Fire; and then di|rected the People to Mr. Williams's Hou&s;e, a Mob &s;oon a&s;|&s;embled there, and began to break into the Court-Yard; Mr. Williams kept in the Hou&s;e upon the Defen&s;ive with
<PB N="45" REF="011176_0023_0F862BE168203780">
Fire Arms, and afterwards went into the Court and there parlied with them. The Mob demanded that he &s;hould meet them at Liberty-Tree the next Day at Noon and there re&s;ign his Commi&s;&s;ion: He refu&s;ed to do either; but &s;aid he would be upon 'Change next Day at Noon, and would there be ready to give an An&s;wer to any Thing that &s;hould be Objected to him. By this Time &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates and other Gentlemen of the Town had got to the Place, and they per&s;uaded the Mob to accept of the Offer and to di&s;|per&s;e.</P>
<P>The next Day Mr. Williams attended by &s;everal Gentle|men, among whom were &s;ome of the Council; went about Noon into the Council-Chamber. There were about 1500 People a&s;&s;embled about the Town Hou&s;e: Mr. Williams went into the Balcony of the Council-Chamber, and told the People he was come according to his Promi&s;e, to An&s;wer any Objections which were urged again&s;t him. Nothing was offered: after a Quarter of an Hour's interval, he re|peated his Propo&s;al again; nothing was &s;aid except by an Ignorant Fellow, who&s;e Ab&s;urdity created laughter. After a little Stay, they all departed in &s;eeming good Humour, and Mr. Williams returned to his Hou&s;e, accompanied by the Gentlemen who had attended him, in Peace and Quiet.</P>
<P>This tran&s;action has flung great Di&s;grace upon, and given great Chagrin to the Faction; and I am told they are de|termined to retrieve it.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the directors of the Mob, dur&s;t not &s;hew their Faces at this Place, and upon this Occa&s;ion, left they &s;hould thereby acknowledge that they had &s;pirited them up to the la&s;t Night's Work. They now glo&s;s it over by giving out that the Mob of that Night were not the true Sons of Liberty, and acted without Authority, and an Adverti&s;e|ment is publi&s;hed in the Bo&s;ton-Gazette, &s;igned by a pre|tended Secretary of the Sons of Liberty, di&s;claiming the requiring Mr. Williams to appear upon Change, and threatning the Printer who &s;hould make U&s;e of the Name of the Sons of Liberty, <HI>without an authentic Order.</HI> Some|thing is to be done and &s;oon to recover the Spirit of the Sons of Liberty. I am told that &s;ome of the Chiefs of them are this Day to go to Mr. Williams and advi&s;e him as a Friend if he will not re&s;ign his Commi&s;&s;ion, to retire to the Ca&s;tle; if he does not his Hou&s;e will be de&s;troyed, and him&s;elf killed. What will be the End of this we mu&s;t wait to know.</P>

<P>Since I wrote the foregoing, I have &s;een Mr. Williams. He confirms this Account, and adds that the Mob expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;&s;atisfaction that tho&s;e who &s;et them on did not ap|pear to talk for them. Several of the Mob, and particularly the Captain, a noted Mob leader have declared their Appro|bation of Mr. Williams's Conduct, and that they will defend him again&s;t any other Attack. On the other Hand great Pains are taken to drive him out by intimidation: private Letters have been &s;ent to him; without a Name; and one of the Chiefs of the Faction declared publickly again&s;t his fool hardine&s;s in &s;taying in this Town, But Mr. Williams declares he will not go out of the Town, unle&s;s he is drove out by Force. He tells me he fears no Danger: And I am inclined to think he will &s;ucceed in his Defiance of the Fac|tion and their Tools. If he does he may do good Service in le&s;&s;ening the Terror which the Troops of the Faction have occa&s;ioned here.</P>

<P>YOUR Lord&s;hip will ob&s;erve from my Letter No. 9, and its Inclo&s;ures, that I &s;ignified to the Hou&s;e that, if I &s;hould be obliged to di&s;&s;olve the A&s;&s;embly, I &s;hould not think my&s;elf at Liberty to call another until I received His Ma|je&s;ty's Orders; therefore I was a&s;ked in Council, whether I had received a &s;pecial Order for that Purpo&s;e, or whether I drew it by Implication from any Part of your Lord&s;hip's Letter: I an&s;wered that I drew it from two Pa&s;&s;ages in your Lord&s;hip's Letter; Fir&s;t, I am ordered if I di&s;&s;olve the A&s;&s;em|bly to &s;end an Account of their Proceedings, that his Maje&s;ty may lay the &s;ame before his Parliament, to prevent &s;uch Conduct for the future. Now if I was to call another A&s;&s;em|bly
<PB N="47" REF="011176_0024_0F862BE22B614150">
without Order, it might not be in the Power of the King, or the Parliament, to prevent &s;uch Conduct for the future; for it would probably be repealed before any Provi&s;ion could be made again&s;t it. 2dly. Your Lord&s;hip &s;ignifies to me that if the Di&s;&s;olution &s;hould operate to the Di&s;continuance of any nece&s;&s;ary E&s;tabli&s;hments, Care will be taken for the Sup|port of Government.&mdash;By this it is plain, that your Lord&s;hip does not expect, that I &s;hould call a new A&s;&s;embly; for in &s;uch Ca&s;e your Lord&s;hip would have directed me to call upon the new A&s;&s;embly to renew the di&s;continued E&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P>But if your Lord&s;hip's Intention had not appeared &s;o plain, my own Di&s;cretion would have directed me, not to have called another A&s;&s;embly &s;oon after the Di&s;&s;olution of the former.&mdash;Such a Proceeding has &s;carce ever &s;ailed to produce bad Con&s;equences; in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e it would have the wor&s;t. The chief Alteration in the Hou&s;e would be in the Exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e few Members, or a great Part of them who, in the late Que&s;tion, dared to &s;ide with the King, and have &s;ince been held up in the public Papers, as Objects of the Re&s;entment of the People. It were to be wi&s;hed, that a new A&s;&s;embly might not be called untill the People had got into a better Temper, and had gained truer Notions of their Rights and Intere&s;t, than they have at pre|&s;ent: When that Time will come, God knows; it will de|pend more upon what is done at We&s;tmin&s;ter, than upon any Mea&s;ures that can be pur&s;ued here. I can therefore only &s;tate to your Lord&s;hip, the Inconveniencies which will attend the not calling the A&s;&s;embly, until the next General Election, and wait your Lord&s;hip's Orders.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual Time for the A&s;&s;embly's Meeting for the Win|ter Se&s;&s;ion, has of late been about the Middle of January.&mdash;The Se&s;&s;ion has u&s;ually la&s;ted about two Months; great Part of which has been lately &s;pent in political Squabbles, rather than in real Bu&s;ine&s;s. The ordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Se&s;&s;ion has been to elect Officers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Trea&s;urer, Commi&s;&s;a|ry, and Impo&s;t-Officer, and &s;ome le&s;&s;er of no great Signifi|cance, to grant Salaries to the Judges, and other Officers, and to the Pre&s;ident and Profe&s;&s;ors of the College, &amp;c. and to pa&s;s the Act of Tonnage and Impo&s;t. The Election of Officers may be po&s;tponed; for in &s;uch Ca&s;e, they would continue in their Offices by their former Appointment; and the Election is nothing more but the Continuance of the &s;ame Officers. The Grants of Salaries may be po&s;tponed, with|out any other Inconvenience than a Delay of Payment for
<PB N="48" REF="011176_0025_0F862BE2E6A68418">
about three Months. The not renewing the Impo&s;t-Bill, would, I believe di&s;continue that Revenue for about two Months, but I can't be certain of it, as I have not the Bill by me. The&s;e are the principal ordinary Inconveniencies which would ari&s;e from the not calling another A&s;&s;embly before next May; they mu&s;t be balanced by the Advantages pro|po&s;ed by the Su&s;pen&s;ion; and the whole will be governed by the Mea&s;ures which are taken for the Re&s;toration of the Government. And I mu&s;t beg your Lord&s;hip's Favor, that I may receive Orders, whether I am, or am not, to call the A&s;&s;embly; for when the u&s;ual Time &s;hall come, it will be quite nece&s;&s;ary, that the Governor &s;hould be able to vouch po&s;itive Orders for his not calling the A&s;&s;embly, if he is not to do it.&mdash;In Regard to the calling the new A&s;&s;embly in May, it will require much Con&s;ideration; but there is Time eno' for that as yet.</P>
<P>There is another Matter for Con&s;ideration in calling a new A&s;&s;embly, which I cannot overlook, becau&s;e it is a common Subject of Reflection; and yet I mu&s;t own I dare not give my Advice in it with that Freedom, with which I could wi&s;h to act in all publick Bu&s;ine&s;s; it is, whether, when a new A&s;&s;embly is called, it ought to meet at Bo&s;ton, or at &s;ome other Town. People imagine, that the principal Part, which Bo&s;ton (di&s;tingui&s;hed from other Towns) has taken in rai&s;ing and &s;omenting the pre&s;ent Troubles of the Province and the Continent, will probably incur, and de&s;erve the Cen&s;ure of having the Government removed from it; others &s;ay, that, if Bo&s;ton is &s;ubjected, and brought into order, the In|conveniences which the Government now feels, by being &s;eated there, would be removed. For my own part, I could &s;peak upon this Subject, where I could explain my&s;elf occa&s;ionally, but I know not how to write upon it; all that I can now &s;ay is, that, if the prevailing Faction &s;hould be effectually checked, and the terror of the Mobs re|moved, it might be better to keep the Government here; but undoubtedly, for the&s;e three Years la&s;t. Government has &s;uffered very much by its being &s;eated here. There are no two Towns on the Continent more contra&s;ted, in regard to Re&s;pect, and Duty to the King's Government both at Home and here, than Bo&s;ton and (the &s;econd Town in the Pro|vince) Salem.&mdash;And yet I could not recommend the removing the Government to Salem, otherwi&s;e than as a temporary Cen&s;ure; but this is a &s;ubject too delicate for public letters.</P>
<P>Having gone thus far, I find a great Deficiency from the want of a proper Repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent State of this
<PB N="49" REF="011176_0025_0F862BE2E6A68418">
Government, which is brought &s;o low, that it can never re|cover it&s;elf by any internal Means, without a Sacrifice of the Rights of the imperial Power: This is a nice Ta&s;k, and I wi&s;h I could do it in Per&s;on, if I cannot, I &s;hall have much Difficulty to repre&s;ent it in Writing, and will overcome it as well as I can.</P>

<P>I THINK it proper to inform your Lord&s;hip, that for above a Week pa&s;t there has been agitated among the Merchants of this Town a Sub&s;cription again&s;t import|ing Engli&s;h Goods.&mdash;It was begun by two principal Merchants who have all along abetted the Purpo&s;es of the Faction; at fir&s;t they met with very little Succe&s;s, but per|&s;evering in it, and Ways and Means being u&s;ed to pu&s;h it on, it was la&s;t Night reported at their third Meeting, that there was a &s;ufficient Number of Sub&s;cribers to carry the Matter into Execution, that there were forty who would not &s;ub&s;cribe, but would ob&s;erve the Re&s;triction, and thirty five who would neither &s;ub&s;cribe nor ob&s;erve. The latter I &s;up|po&s;e are to be brought to Rea&s;on by Mob-Law, otherwi&s;e thirty five Importers only, will defeat the Scheme.</P>
<P>There was the like Sub&s;cription &s;et about at the beginning of March la&s;t, of which I gave an Account in my Letter to my Lord Shelburne, No. 9. That was defeated by the Mer|chants of Philadelphia refu&s;ing to concur in the Mea&s;ure, and the Merchants of New-York thereupon declining it al&s;o, upon which tho&s;e of Bo&s;ton were obliged to give it up: but now I &s;uppo&s;e they a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of better Succe&s;s at tho&s;e Places, and expect to rai&s;e a Combination formidable enough to alarm Great-Britain, at the Meeting of the Par|liament. But, my Lord, the Futility of this Threat will be expo&s;ed by an Enquiry into the Quantity of Goods which have been lately ordered from Great-Britain, which has ex|ceeded

and anticipated the u&s;ual Quantities and Times in Order to provide for an Ab&s;tinence from Importation for a Year: This is profe&s;&s;ed by &s;ome, and is undoubtedly true of others, who are too attentive to their own Intere&s;t to de&s;i&s;t from Importation without taking Care not to have Occa&s;ion for it. But the Non-&s;ub&s;cribers, among which are &s;ome of the principal Importers of the Town, will effectually defeat this Scheme, if they are &s;ufficiently &s;ecured from Mobs, which it is &s;uppo&s;ed they and all others will be before the fir&s;t of January next.</P>

Weeks, is not yet come here; by it I expect to receive the Original of No. 10.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip's Ob&s;ervation of the Intention of the Fac|tion, to defeat all conciliating Mea&s;ures, will be fully con|firmed, if it is not a ready. Their Influence over the Courts of Ju&s;tice, e&s;pecially at Bo&s;ton, is carried to an enormous Length, of which there has been lately a mo&s;t extraordinary In&s;tance. On Monday Augu&s;t 22d, being the Day before the &s;itting of the Superior Court, there came out in the Bo&s;ton-Gazette a mo&s;t virulent Libel again&s;t the Chief Ju&s;tice, in which he was threatned, that if he gave any more &s;uch Charges as at the former Se&s;&s;ion, his private Life and Con|ver&s;ation &s;hould be expo&s;ed in that Paper, by which he is to be rendered odious to the People. The next Day when the Court was opened the Grand Jury was found to have among them &s;everal of the Abettors of the Bo&s;ton Mobs, and par|ticularly the famous is Capt. Malcolm, who having twice in a forcible Manner &s;et the Laws of Trade at Defiance with Succe&s;s, has thereby rai&s;ed him&s;elf to be a Mob Captain; and was actually the rai&s;er of the Mob which abu&s;ed the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers on the 10th of June la&s;t. This Man was tho't a fit Per&s;on to be upon a Grand Jury before whom his own Riots were to be enquired into. To account for this your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t know that in this Government, Juries, both, Grand and Petty, are not returned by and at the Election of the Sheriff, but by the Appointment of the &s;everal Towns and returned by the Con&s;tables.</P>
<P>This being the Ca&s;e, it was to no Purpo&s;e for the Chief Ju&s;tice to enter into Particulars concerning the late Riots: He therefore made his Charge general, except only vindicat|ing him&s;elf from an infamous Lie publi&s;hed in the Bo&s;ton-Gazette, a&s;&s;erting that he had received a Commi&s;&s;ion from England appointing him Chief Ju&s;tice. The Attorney-General had been ordered by me with the Advice of Council to pro&s;ecute the Rioters on the 10th of June. But when he came to lay it before the Grand Jury, no Evidence could be procured again&s;t any one Man. There had been 2 or 300 People who paraded and did great part of the Mi&s;chief in the public Streets in the Day time; and yet no Man could be found who dared to Charge any of them, And it is no wonder whil&s;t the Head of the Mob &s;at upon the Grand Jury ready to Mark tho&s;e who &s;hould te&s;tify again&s;t his Mob, And I &s;uppo&s;e the Attorney-General was not very earne&s;t in endeavouring to procure Evidence; as he mu&s;t
<PB N="52" REF="011176_0027_0F862BE46647FFB8">
&s;ee that before &s;uch a Grand Jury there was no Probabilty of getting a Bill found.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry my Lord, that I cannot continue to give the Council that Credit, which I have done in former Letters, immediately after the Vote in the Hou&s;e for not Re&s;cinding, &amp;c. The Council &s;uffered &s;o great a change that they don't appear to be the &s;ame Per&s;ons. And I can no longer de|pend upon them, for that a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which I have been u&s;ed to expect and often to receive of them, in &s;upport of the Rights of the Crown. They &s;eem to have caught the general Intimidation, to look upon the Cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent Govern|ment, to be de&s;perate, and to think that it is high Time that they &s;hould take Care of their Intere&s;ts with the pre|vailing Party of the People. And yet I am convinced that the&s;e Gentlemen or the greate&s;t part of them are in their Hearts Friends to Government, and would choo&s;e to be numbered among them, if they were Independent of the People. But it is a <HI>melancholick</HI> Truth, that this Govern|ment after a three Years War is <HI>a</HI> Length &s;ubdued, and in my Opinion will never recover it&s;elf, until &s;ome Amendment is made in the Con&s;titution, e&s;pecially in the Appointment and Stability of the Council.

<P>IN the Bo&s;ton Gazette of the 5th In&s;tant, appeared a Paper, containing a Sy&s;tem of Politicks, exceeding all former Exceedings. Some took it for the ca&s;ual Eai&s;ings of an occa&s;ional Enthu&s;ia&s;t. But I per&s;uaded my&s;elf it came out of the Cabinet of the Faction, and was preparatory to &s;ome actual Operations again&s;t the Government. In this Ver&s;wa&s;ion I con&s;idered that if the Troops from Halifax were to come here of a &s;udden, there would be no avoiding an In&s;urrection, which would at lea&s;t fall upon the Crown Officers, if it did not amount to an Oppo&s;ition to the Troops. I therefore thought it would be be&s;t that the Expectation of the Troops &s;hould be gradu|ally communicated, that the Heads, of the Faction might have Time to con&s;ider well what they were about, and pru|dent Men Opportunity to interpo&s;e their Advice. I there|fore
<PB N="53" REF="011176_0027_0F862BE46617FFB8">
took an Occa&s;ion to mention to one of the Council, in the Way of Di&s;cour&s;e, that I had private Advice that Troops were ordered hither, but I had no public Orders about it my&s;elf. This was on the 8th In&s;tant, and before Night it was thoroughly circulated all over the Town.</P>
<P>The Faction immediately took the Alarm; and at fir&s;t nothing was to be heard among them but Declarations that the Troops &s;hould not enter the Town. But nothing was done in Public, but appointing a Town-Meeting on Monday following. In private there were, as I am told two Meetings, the one a large one on Friday Night (the 9th) where it was the general Opinion that they &s;hould rai&s;e the Country, and oppo&s;e the Troops. The other Meeting as I am informed, was very &s;mall and private on Saturday Night at the Hou&s;e of one of the Chiefs, and there it was re&s;olved to &s;urprize and take the Ca&s;tle on the Monday Night following. I don't re|late the&s;e Accounts as certain Facts, but only as reported and believed. On Saturday Night an empty Turpentine Barrel was put up upon the Poll of the Beacon (which had been lately erected anew in a great Hurry by the Select Men without con&s;ulting me). This gave a great Alarm the next Day, and the Council &s;ent to me on Sunday Afternoon to de&s;ire I would order a Council, which I held at a Gentleman's Hou&s;e half Way between me and Bo&s;ton. Here it was de|bated what Means &s;hould be u&s;ed to take the Barrel down; and it was re&s;olved that the Selectmen &s;hould be de&s;ired to take it down, but they would not do it.</P>
<P>On the Monday at the Hall the Faction appeared &s;urround|ed with all its Forces. There were very few of the princi|pal Gentlemen there; &s;uch as were, appeared only as cu|rious and perhaps anxious Spectators; the Meeting was o|pened with Speeches much to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e as the Paper enclo&s;ed and fir&s;t mentioned. Nothing was then re&s;olved but to put two Que&s;tions to me, which your Lord&s;hip will &s;ee in the printed Account; and to appoint a general Com|mittee to con&s;ider and report. The next Day the Reports were made, upon which followed a Set of Speeches by the Chiefs of the Faction and no one el&s;e; which followed one another in &s;uch Order, and Method, that it appeared us if they were acting a Play, every Thing both as to Matter and Order, &s;eeming to have been preconcerted before hand. As they have printed their own Account to circulate it round the Province, I &s;hall only add to it, an Account of &s;ome of the&s;e Speeches, from the Tenor of which the general Inten|tion of the whole Tran&s;action will be fully explained.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="011176_0028_0F862BE750900D20">
I &s;hould have mentioned before, that in the Middle of the Hall where they met, were depo&s;ited in Che&s;ts the Town-Arms, amounting as it is &s;aid to about 400. The&s;e as I have before informed your Lord&s;hip, about 4 or 5 Months ago, were taken out of the Lumber Rooms, where they had lain for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, to be cleaned; and have &s;ince been laid upon the Floor of the Town-Hall to remind the People of the U&s;e of them. The&s;e Arms were often the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and were of &s;ingular U&s;e to the Orators in the way of Action. As the &s;ubject of their Debates turned upon Arming the Town and Country again&s;t <HI>their Enemies,</HI> the Probability of a French War was mentioned as a Pretence for Arming the Town, and a Cover for the frequent U&s;e of the Word <HI>Enemy.</HI> It was &s;aid that the <HI>Enemy</HI> would proba|bly be here before the Convention met, that is within ten Days; it was moved that the Arms &s;hould be now delivered out to oppo&s;e the <HI>Enemy;</HI> this was objected to, for that they might fall into Hands, who would not u&s;e them. But this flim&s;y Veil was not always kept on; it was often &s;aid, that they had a Right to oppo&s;e with Arms a Military Force, which was &s;ent to oblige them to &s;ubmit to uncon&s;titutional Laws, and when it was required to be more explicit, the Chairman &s;aid, that they under&s;tood one another very well, and pointing with his Hand, added there are the Arms; when an Attempt is made again&s;t your Liberties, they will be de|livered, our Declaration wants no Explication! And indeed it does not.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t it was moved that the Governor be de&s;ired to call an A&s;&s;embly, it was &s;aid to be to provide for the Safety of the Province, and put it in a Po&s;ture of Defence: It was there|upon, ob&s;erved that that would make Troops nece&s;&s;ary, and it was immediately &s;truck out: One cried out that they wanted a Head; this was over-ruled, for indeed it was too premature. Another an old Man, prote&s;ted again&s;t every Thing but ri&s;ing immediately, and taking all Power into their own Hands. One Man very profligate and abandoned, argued for Ma&s;|&s;acring their Enemies, his Argument was &s;hort,&mdash;Liberty is as precious as Life; if a Man attempts to take my Life, I have a Right to take his. Ergo, If a Man attempts to take away my Liberty, I have a Right to take his Life. He al&s;o argued that when a People's Liberties were threatened, they were in a State of War, and had a Right to de&s;end them|&s;elves. And he carried the&s;e Arguments &s;o far, that his own Party were obliged to &s;ilence him.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="011176_0028_0F862BE750900D20">
I will now make one Ob&s;ervation on one Pa&s;&s;age in the printed Declaration, to &s;hew to what Length is capable of being carried, a Preten&s;ion to an Exemption from the Autho|rity of Great-Britain. It has been heretofore argued that the Parliament has no Authority over the American Colo|ni&s;ts, becau&s;e they are not repre&s;ented in the Parliament of Great-Britain; and in Con&s;equence that the provincial A&s;|&s;emblies are to all Intents and Purpo&s;es the Parliament in Regard to the Subjects of the re&s;pective Colonies. This has been heretofore applied only to the rai&s;ing and di&s;po&s;ing of public Money, and now ob&s;erve a large Stride to a very differ|ent Bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e it is declared in an Act of the fir&s;t of William and Mary, that no Standing Army &s;hall be kept up in the Kingdom in Time of Peace but by Con&s;ent of Par|liament, therefore the King &s;hall not keep any Part of the Standing Army rai&s;ed and &s;upported by the Parliament in any American Province without the Con&s;ent of the Provincial A&s;&s;embly. And this Exemption is pleaded in Virtue of a Charter granted by King William, &amp;c. without the Authority of Parliament, and con&s;equently according to true Revolu|tional Principles not to be pleaded again&s;t the Parliament, as according to &s;uch Principles the King has no Power by his own Act only, to exempt any Subjects of Great-Britain from the Authority of Parliament.</P>
<P>I herewith inclo&s;e a Blank Copy of the Precept which the Selectmen of Bo&s;ton have u&s;ed in calling together the Convention: Surely &s;o daring an A&s;&s;umption of the Royal Authority was never practiced by any City or Town in the Briti&s;h Dominions, even in the Times of greate&s;t Di&s;order; not even by the City of London, when the great Rebellion was at the highe&s;t, and the Confu&s;ion ari&s;ing from thence mo&s;t urgent for &s;ome extraordinary Mea&s;ures. How large this Meeting will be, and what they will do, at pre&s;ent can only be gue&s;t at. But as they have hitherto pur&s;ued the Dictates of the Paper in the Bo&s;ton-Gazette, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed that they will go through with them, and exclude <HI>the Crown Officers,</HI> and re&s;ume <HI>the fir&s;t original Charter,</HI> which has no Ingredient of Royalty in it. It certainly will be &s;o&punc; if it is not prevented by Power from without: And I much doubt whether the Force already ordered by General Gage, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> two Regiments, will be &s;ufficient. For my own Part, if I had any Place of Protection to re&s;ort to, I would publi&s;h a Proclamation again&s;t the a&s;&s;embling the Convention. But I dare not take &s;o &s;pirited a Step without fir&s;t &s;ecuring my Retreat.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="011176_0029_0F862BE8923DC8D8">
It is now a great Que&s;tion whether the King's Troops will be &s;uffered to enter the Town or not: the general Opinion is in the Affirmative. The De&s;ign again&s;t the Ca&s;tle is now &s;o well known that it is probable that the very Names of the People who were enrolled for that Service to the Number of 500, or of the Chief of them will be di&s;covered. The Chiefs of the Party now own that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to hold the Ca&s;tle or the Town, tho' they &s;hould &s;eize and Garri&s;on them for the pre&s;ent. They therefore, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, &s;eem content that the Troops &s;hall &s;tay here, till the Parliament has determined upon their Re|mon&s;trances; as they &s;ay the Troops cannot remain here for two Years, if the Parliament refu&s;es to do them Ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>UPON the Receipt of your Lord&s;hip's Letter No. 16. I ordered a Council to be called on the Morning of Monday la&s;t; at which Time I communicated the two fir&s;t Paragraphs of your Lord&s;hip's Letter, and al&s;o a Letter from General Gage to me, wherein he writes, that, in Obedience to His Maje&s;ty's Commands, he had ordered two Regiments from Halifax to Bo&s;ton, the one to be quartered at Bo&s;ton, the other at Ca&s;tle William, and de&s;iring that Quarters might be provided for them.&mdash;The Council in&s;tantly re&s;orted to the Act of Parliament, and there it was read, that if there were no Barracks, the Troops &s;hould be quartered in the Public Hou&s;es, and if they were not &s;ufficient; then the Go|vernor and Council, or in their Default, the Ju&s;tices of Peace &s;hould hire Barns, Out-Hou&s;es, &amp;c. for them. They therefore &s;aid, that as there were no Barracks, they had nothing to do with it; for it was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Con&s;tables to billet them in the Publick Hou&s;es, and the Council had nothing to do till the Public Hou&s;es were full. I an&s;wered, that they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that this Act of Par|liament (which &s;eemed to be made only with a view to marching Troops) could not be carried into Execution in this Ca&s;e; for if the&s;e Troops were to be quartered in Pub|lic
<PB N="57" REF="011176_0029_0F862BE8923DC8D8">
Hou&s;es, and thereby mixt with the People, their Inter|cour&s;e would be a perpetual Source of Affrays and Blood|&s;heds; and I was &s;ure, that no Commanding Officer would Con&s;ent to having his Troops &s;eparated into &s;mall Parties in a Town, where there was &s;o public and profe&s;&s;ed a di&s;&s;af|fection to His Maje&s;ty's Briti&s;h Government; and as to hi|ring Barns, Out-Hou&s;es, &amp;c. it was mere trifling to apply that Clau&s;e to Winter Quarters in this Country, where the Men could not live but in Buildings with tight Walls and plenty of Fire Places; therefore the only Thing to be done was to provide Barracks, and to &s;ay, that there were none, was only true, that there was no Building built for that pur|po&s;e; but there were many public Buildings, that might be fitted up for that purpo&s;e with no great Inconvenience. At la&s;t what I &s;aid produced a Committee of Council, to confer with the Select-Men about providing Quarters for the Troops; and the Council was adjourned.</P>
<P>I had no Opinion of this Reference, but could not avoid con&s;enting to it.&mdash;I con&s;idered that the Select-Men were the Tools of the Faction, and the De&s;ign of the latter was to embarra&s;s the Bu&s;ine&s;s of providing Quarters, &s;o as to oblige the Officers to make good their own Quarters, and from thence, to ground an In&s;urrection of the People again&s;t the Invaders of their Property.&mdash;I was told 2 or 3 Days before this Council met that&mdash;explained the plan at the Town-Meeting, (or at &s;ome other Meeting about the &s;ame Time, I forget which) in the following Manner. "There are no Barracks in the Town, and therefore by Act of Parliament they mu&s;t be quartered in the public Hou&s;es; but no one will keep a public Hou&s;e on &s;uch Terms, and there will be no public Hou&s;es; then the Governor and Council mu&s;t hire Barns, Out-Hou&s;es, &amp;c. for them; but no Body is ob|liged to let them, no Body will let them, no Body will dare to let them. The Troops are forbid to quarter them&s;elves in any other Manner than according to the Act of Parlia|ment under &s;evere Penalties; but they can't quarter them|&s;elves according to the Act, and therefore they mu&s;t leave the Town, or &s;eize on Quarters contrary to the Act. When they do this, when they invade Property, contrary to an Act of Parliament, we may re&s;i&s;t them with the law on our Side."&mdash;So here is a Sy&s;tem to make an Act impracticable&punc; and then to oppo&s;e the King's Troops for not ob&s;erving it! In|deed the Act is impracticable enough without all this Con|trivance; but what is mo&s;t &s;urprizing is, that &s;o many Per|&s;ons
<PB N="58" REF="011176_0030_0F862BE9ABF612F8">
of Con&s;ideration and Property &s;hould join in &s;upporting a Scheme, which, if it is carried into its full Execution, mu&s;t involve this Town into univer&s;al De&s;olation and Ruin, in Order to &s;ave a few de&s;perate and wicked Mem from being made an&s;werable for their Crimes; and yet your Lord&s;hip will find the forementioned Sy&s;tem of Rea&s;oning adopted by Men, from whom one could not expect to have heard it &s;eriou&s;ly mentioned.</P>
<P>At the next Council, which was Ye&s;terday, the Committee reported, that the Selectmen had given for An&s;wer, that there was an Act of Parliament for the quartering the Troops, and they had nothing to do with it; but give it for their Opinion, that it would be mo&s;t for the Peace of the Town, that the two Regiments expected from Halifax &s;hould be quar|tered at the Ca&s;tle.&mdash;That in Regard to the Troops expected from Ireland, it was Time enough to think of them, as it would be a long Time before they would arrive, and mo&s;t probably they would not come before Winter; for Mr. Hancock, one of the Selectmen, had told them, that he had Advice from London, that the Troops ordered from Ireland would not &s;ail till after the Parliament met; and&mdash;,the Gentleman who reported, &s;aid, that if they were to &s;ail this Fall, it would be &s;o late, that probably they would not get in the&s;e Seas till Winter was &s;et in, and then they would be drove off the Coa&s;t.&mdash;In this Manner was your Lord&s;hip's po&s;itive Notice of the ordering the&s;e Troops to embark im|mediately, and his Maje&s;ty's Orders thereupon, treated.</P>
<P>After the Report was made, followed &s;everal Speeches, all tending to give Rea&s;ons, why they could not provide Bar|racks for the Reception of the Troops.&mdash;It was &s;trongly urged, that the Act of Parliament directed how to quarter the Troops, and they could not depart from it.&mdash;I reminded them, that at the la&s;t Council it was generally agreed, that it would never do to quarter the Troops in public Hou&s;es; for it would produce the utmo&s;t Di&s;order throughout the Town; and they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the Troops could not live in the Winter of this Country in Barns, Out-Hou&s;es, &amp;c.&mdash;That I did not want them to act again&s;t the Act of Parliament, but to carry into Execution the fir&s;t Part of it, which recommended the Troops being put into Barracks, as the mo&s;t preferable Di&s;po&s;ition, and thereby avoid re&s;orting to the latter Parts of it, which had been admitted by them to be impracticable&mdash;They an&s;wered, that if they were to follow the Act of Parliament, the Barracks at the Ca&s;tle,
<PB N="59" REF="011176_0030_0F862BE9ABF612F8">
which were in the Town of Bo&s;ton, mu&s;t be filled, before they could demand other Quarters.&mdash;That the Barracks at the Ca&s;tle would hold the whole of the two Regiments from Halifax.&mdash;I ob&s;erved, that they confounded the Words Town and Town&s;hip; that the Ca&s;tle was indeed in the Town&s;hip of Bo&s;ton, but was &s;o far from being in the Town, that it was di&s;tant from it by Water three Miles, and by Land &s;even.&mdash;Be&s;ides, in the General's Orders, there was an expre&s;s Di&s;tinction between the Town and the Ca&s;tle, one Regiment being to be quartered in the Town, and the other at the Ca&s;tle&mdash;That it could not thereby be intended, that both &s;hould be quartered at the Ca&s;tle&mdash;And in your Lord&s;hip's Orders, that the two Regiments from Ireland &s;hould be landed at Bo&s;ton, it could not be conceived, that your Lord&s;hip imagined, that the Ca&s;tle, which was known to &s;tand upon an I&s;land &s;ome Miles di&s;tant from Bo&s;ton, was in Bo&s;ton; and that in executing tho&s;e Orders, it would be &s;ufficient to land tho&s;e Regiments at the Ca&s;tle. But it was in&s;i&s;ted, that Town and Town&s;hip was the &s;ame, and that the Ca&s;tle was in the Town of Bo&s;ton; and that as the Act had di|rected the Barracks to be fir&s;t u&s;ed, neither the General's Letter nor your Lord&s;hip's could alter the Law; and one Gentleman added, that if there had been other Barracks in the Province, tho' at 50 Miles di&s;tant, they mu&s;t be filled, before any Quarters could be demanded at Bo&s;ton&mdash;I told them, that this fallacious Way of Rea&s;oning, however it might flatter them, would not pa&s;s el&s;ewhere; and particu|larly they never would be able to per&s;wade the commanding Officers, who are ordered to land their Troops at Bo&s;ton, to land them at the Ca&s;tle; and therefore, as the Officers would certainly bring their Troops into the Town, if no Barracks were provided for them, they would in their own Defence be obliged to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the public Buildings, and make Barracks for them&s;elves.&mdash;I was then told by one Gentleman, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the Troops would be under my Command, if they &s;hould come into Town, and take Quarters contrary to Laws, I &s;hould be charged as the Author of it.&mdash;I replied, that whatever Power I might have over the Troops, I certainly &s;hould not have that of requir|ing them to di&s;obey their Orders.&mdash;On the other Hand, I de&s;ired them to con&s;ider, what they would have to an&s;wer for, if, by refu&s;ing to concur with me in providing Barracks for the Troops, they &s;hould oblige them to provide their own Quarters, and thereby afford a Pretence for the Enemies

of the public Peace to draw the People into an Oppo&s;ition to the King's Troops, which they had in vain attempted to bring about previous to their landing.&mdash;I then gave them the Account of the Declaration of&mdash;upon this Sub|ject, as mentioned in Pa. 2 &amp; 3, of this Letter; and I might have added, that it was long ago &s;ince I fir&s;t heard, that it was the Intention of the Faction to embarra&s;s the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Quartering the Troops, and thereby &s;et them and the People together by the Ears&mdash;In the Cour&s;e of this Di&s;pute, it was frequently urged on the Side of the Council, that they had no Power to draw Money out of the Trea&s;ury for building or fitting up Barracks.&mdash;This Argument was always ready at hand, when any Plan was propo&s;ed for the Purpo&s;e&mdash;As I &s;aw we were like to ri&s;e without doing any Thing, I was reduced to make a Propo&s;al as my ultimate Effort.

I &s;poke this &s;o forcibly, that &s;ome of them were &s;taggered, and de&s;ired further Time to con&s;ider of it; I therefore adjourned the Council to this Day; and &s;ince, on Account of the Weather, To-morrow&mdash;I have &s;ince &s;poke with &s;everal of them, and they all tell me, that I &s;hall never get a Vote for providing Barracks for

<DATELINE><HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> <DATE><HI>Sept. 26th,</HI> 1768.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I NOW &s;end your Lord&s;hip a Copy of the Council's An|&s;wer to me concerning providing Barracks for the Troops, and what is extraordinary in Print; which &s;hall be explained in Order. In the P. S. of my la&s;t, I informed your Lord&s;hip that the Council &s;ent to me on Saturday to de&s;ire that I would meet them to receive their An&s;wer to my Propo&s;al of fitting up the Manufactory-Hou&s;e. At that Time there was a violent Storm of Wind &amp; Rain, and I was at my Country Hou&s;e at Roxbury 5 Miles from Bo&s;ton. I thought by their being in &s;uch an Hurry that they intended to do &s;omething; and as there was no Time to be lo&s;t, I determined not to regard the Weather, but &s;et out immediately for Bo&s;ton; and I therefore was &s;urprized to find that I was &s;ent for in &s;uch a Storm meerly to receive a Refu&s;al, for I was not in the Secret then, and did not know that all this Hurry and Drawing me through the wor&s;t Weather I almo&s;t ever tra|velled in, was to get their Writings thro', &s;o that they might put it in the public Papers on Monday.</P>
<P>I mentioned to your Lord&s;hip that they had taken back their An&s;wer to correct &s;ome Mi&s;takes; the&s;e Mi&s;takes were mentioning Sayings of mine which I never &s;aid, and couch|ing In&s;inuations which I did not ob&s;erve. Upon my explain|ing the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, it was &s;aid that nothing was intended again&s;t me, and that they would alter the Pa&s;&s;ages to my Satisfaction; and they offered to do it directly. I told them that I had rather that they &s;hould take it back and recon&s;i|der the whole; for it &s;eemed to me that it wanted Altera|tion upon their Account as well as mine. It was objected that it would cau&s;e the unnece&s;&s;ary Trouble of calling ano|ther Council; I an&s;wered that as there was nothing to be Advi&s;ed or Ordered, I would Con&s;ent that they &s;hould deli|ver the Paper, when corrected, to the Secretary, without calling a Council in form.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="011176_0032_0F862BEB299635B0">
They met early next Monday Morning in the Council Chamber, when they made &s;ome little Alterations to remove what I had excepted to, which however was not done fully. After which it was moved (neither my&s;elf nor the Secretary being pre&s;ent) that this An&s;wer &s;hould be printed in one of the Papers of that Day. This was oppo&s;ed, and occa&s;ioned &s;ome little Debate, when the Que&s;tion was put, and deter|mined in the Affirmative 7 to 3; among the 7 was one Gen|tleman who rather acquie&s;ced than approved; the other 6 being firm in this &s;y&s;tem. In the Cour&s;e of this Debate, and al&s;o in the fir&s;t bringing in this Paper, one Gentleman argued again&s;t it, and prote&s;ted again&s;t &s;ome Parts of it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> another took him a&s;ide and &s;aid, you had better not di&s;tin|gui&s;h your&s;elf in this Oppo&s;ition; the Council are determined not to alter a Word in this Paper, they are re&s;olved to ad|here to the people; the &s;ame la&s;t-mentioned Gentleman in arguing for the printing, &s;aid, I have no immediate commu|nication with them (meaning the Sons of Liberty) but I know pretty well what is going on by my intimately con|ver&s;ing with many of the middling People. I &s;ay it again and again, and would have it well under&s;tood, that if we don't print the An&s;wer to the Governor this Day, there will &s;oon be no Government.</P>
<P>Accordingly they immediately &s;ent for one of the Printers, of the Government Gazette, and ordered him to &s;top his Pre&s;s, and gave the only Copy of the An&s;wer to him, to &s;et the Pre&s;s by, immediately after it was fini&s;hed. I came into the Council Chamber a little after 11, and there I found one of the Council with the Printer correcting the Pre&s;s, after which, and not before, the Paper was delivered to me. I told the Gentleman that I would immediately repre&s;ent this to his Maje&s;ty as the highe&s;t In&s;ult that ever was put upon a King's Governor. He an&s;wered that there was no Intention of affronting <HI>me.</HI> I replied that mo&s;t probably there was not personally, for I had never de&s;erved to be ill u&s;ed by them: but there was a great affront put upon the King in his Repre&s;entative, &amp; it was my Bu&s;ine&s;s to re&s;ent that.</P>
<P>To &s;hew the high Nature of this U&s;urpation, I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve that the Council except in this Legi&s;lative Capacity have no Activity of their own without the Governor; they are by Charter appointed to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Governor, and therefore they cannot meet without the Governor, nor can act in any Bu&s;ine&s;s but what he propo&s;es. Indeed it has been u&s;ual to appoint Committers to prepare Papers
<PB N="64" REF="011176_0033_0F862BEBF5EC0BF0">
for the Council, but then &s;uch Papers are reported to the Governor in Council, and have no Validity until they are confirmed there. But for a Council to meet without the Governor, to appoint a Committee, to meet again and receive the Report of the Committee, to admit a Motion for print|ing their Proceedings, and put the Que&s;tion upon it, and to order the Proceedings to be printed without the Governor's Con&s;ent or Knowledge, and even before it was reported to him, is altogether a Tran&s;action never known or imagined before, and wholly illegal and uncon&s;titutional; there is but one Way to make it regular, and that is to con&s;ider the Council as meeting in their Legi&s;lative Capacity; this in|deed will make all right, and they will form an upper Hou&s;e to the A&s;&s;embly of Repre&s;entatives now &s;itting in Conven|tion, and then there will be nothing wanting to render it a complete General Court, but the Authority and Repre&s;en|tative of the King; if all this coming together does not operate &s;o as to produce an Amendment (at lea&s;t) of the Charter, wi&s;e and good Men who want to &s;ee the Authority of the King's Government re&s;tored, or rather rebuilt upon a more firm Foundation, will be di&s;appointed. There is but one rational Way of accounting for the&s;e Proceedings of the Council, &s;o contrary to their Conduct about &s;even Months ago, and this is, that they are de&s;irous to lend an Hand to the Convention, to bring about a Forfeiture of the Charter; which con&s;idering how they have heretofore been treated by their Con&s;tituents, they may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;ire.</P>
<P>As to the An&s;wer, I have little to &s;ay about it, having fully explained the Sy&s;tem it is founded upon in my Letter immediately preceeding. If it wants any Thing more I will add a Paragraph which one of the Council propo&s;ed to be in&s;erted in their An&s;wer to me, but it was rejected: this Paper has by chance fell into my Hands in the hand-writing of the Propo&s;er; and I will inclo&s;e a Copy of it. It fully &s;hews that there is an Intention of oppo&s;ing the Troops by embarra&s;&s;ing their Quarters and attaching them afterwards by Means of &s;uch Embarra&s;&s;ment, to ju&s;tify which a formal Sy&s;tem of Law is already prepared. As to what the Coun|cil have de&s;ired for the printing a formal An&s;wer to me, which I &s;ent a Copy of to your Lord&s;hip with my Letter No., your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t under&s;tand that &s;ince the Council (I mean the Majority of them in and about the Town of Bo&s;ton) have gone over to the popular Party (the Day of which Revolt is preci&s;ely fixed) they have been very fond in
<PB N="65" REF="011176_0033_0F862BEBF5EC0BF0">
Imitation of the Faction of the Hou&s;e, to do Bu&s;ine&s;s by Writings calculated for the Pre&s;s; the Paper referred to was plainly written for that purpo&s;e, but I prevented its be|ing publi&s;hed hitherto, and &s;hall, notwith&s;tanding this pub|lic Call added to many private. In regard to the pre&s;ent publication, upon the fir&s;t opening this Bu&s;ine&s;s I charged their proceedings with Secrecy, and the only pretence to evade this Charge is that I did not renew that Charge at every Adjournment, tho' the &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s was continued.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, I con&s;ider the Government as entire|ly &s;ubdued, the Outworks have been taken by Degrees, the Citadel, the Council, however remained to the King until within the&s;e 3 Months, now that is &s;urrendered, and the Garri&s;on has joined the Enemy, to &s;peak plain, now the Council co-operate with the Opponents of Government, and they who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t me, do all they can to embarra&s;s me; they who ought to join with me in executing the King's Commands, are at the Head of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them: What can I do, circum&s;tanced as this Government at pre&s;ent is? Ip&s;a Salus non pote&s;t Servare bane rempublicam. If the 3 Regiments ordered to Bo&s;ton were now quietly in their Quarters (which I don't &s;ee how they are like to be by the means of the Civil Power only) it would not follow that the Civil Government could re|&s;ume its Functions. It will take &s;ome time to recover that Intimidation and Lachere which has prevaded all Orders of Men. I &s;hall write more particularly upon this Subject when I write in An&s;wer to the other parts of your Lord&s;hip's Letter which the pre&s;ent Emergencies prevent.</P>

<P>IN my Letter No. 22, I informed your Lord&s;hip of the Origination of calling an A&s;&s;embly of Repre&s;entatives under the Name of a <HI>Committee of Convention,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="66" REF="011176_0034_0F862BECA7DA4928">
that is the Name of the Body, the Members al&s;o are all called Committees; &s;o that for Di&s;tinction &s;ake, we mu&s;t call the Body the Convention. This Convention is now &s;itting, they met on Thur&s;day, and did nothing that Morn|ing but choo&s;e a Chairman and a Clerk, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the late Speaker and the Clerk of the Hou&s;e. The &s;ame Morning I prepared a Me&s;&s;age to this Convention, and left it with Mr. Oliver the Secretary to deliver in the Afternoon. I wrote it wholly in my Hand, and my Name &s;o written was in the Title; but as it was not under&s;igned by me they refu&s;ed to receive it. This was only to gain Time to &s;end me a Me&s;&s;age before they acknowledged the Receipt of mine. As they print what they do, your Lord&s;hip will have their own Account of the&s;e Proceedings. The three Days la&s;t Week, they kept open Doors,&mdash;was then ab&s;ent. The two Days this Week they have kept the Doors &s;hut;&mdash;is with them. What|ever further tran&s;pires I will inform your Lord&s;hip of it.</P>
<P>It is now made a great Que&s;tion in what Manner Great-Britain will re&s;ent this Proceeding; for certainly, at the Fountainhead it was intended to provoke a Re&s;entment, the great Principle of the Faction being to rai&s;e and blow up Fire. Some &s;ay, and e&s;pecially in the Convention it&s;elf, that the Per&s;ons a&s;&s;embling would be by Act of Parliament rendered incapable of &s;erving in any public Office. But this &s;eems to be at once too confined, and too general a Cen&s;ure. The Towns who cho&s;e the&s;e Deputies (next to that who i&s;&s;ued the Summons) are an&s;werable for this Convention; and if they are a Majority of the Towns who &s;end Members, as their own Accounts at the lowe&s;t a&s;&s;ert, the Province is an&s;werable. It is therefore concluded that the mo&s;t proba|ble Con&s;equence will be the Forfeiture of the Charter. If this is the wor&s;t. It is an Event mo&s;t devoutly to be de&s;ired by every Well-wi&s;her to the Province.</P>

<P>THE Day my la&s;t Packet went out of the Harbour, brought in the Fleet from Halifax, with two Regi|ments on board under the Command of Lieutenant-Colonel
<PB N="67" REF="011176_0034_0F862BECA7DA4928">
Dalrymple. As &s;oon as I was informed of it. I went to the Ca&s;tle, and got there before the Ships got to Anchor. Soon after I &s;aw Col. Dalrymple, and informed him of all the Proceedings of the Council concerning his Quarters, and the Difficulties he was to encounter. And it was agreed that I &s;hould call a Council at the Ca&s;tle the next Morning, and invite the Colonel and the Commanding Officer of the Fleet to attend the Council.</P>
<P>The Council accordingly met at the Ca&s;tle the next Morn|ing, being Thur&s;day September 29th. The Commanding Officers likewi&s;e attended after the Bu&s;ine&s;s was opened, the Colonel acquainted them in a very genteel Manner that he was ordered to Quarter one of the Regiments at Bo&s;ton; That he hoped he was going among his Friends, and that his Men would on their Parts behave as &s;uch; That he &s;hould be glad if he could have Quarters in the Way of Barracks, where he could keep his Men under the Eyes of their Officers, and then he would engage that his Men &s;hould be kept in good Order. He added &s;everal kind Expre&s;&s;ions &s;ignifying his De&s;ire to conduct the Bu&s;ine&s;s in a Manner that &s;hould be mo&s;t ea&s;y and agreeable to the Town. He was an&s;wered, That they hoped he would ob&s;erve the Act of Parliament; and if he did, he would put both his Regi|ments in the Barracks at the Ca&s;tle, which were in the Town of Bo&s;ton, and capable of holding two Regiments: That when the Barracks were full, the Council had nothing to do with Quartering Troops till the public Hou&s;es were full. The Colonel &s;aid he would not di&s;pute whether the Ca&s;tle I&s;land was in the Town or not, they certainly were di&s;tinct Places in his Orders: That he was not u&s;ed to di&s;pute his Orders but obey them, and therefore &s;hould mo&s;t certainly march his Regiment in the Town; and if they a&s;&s;igned him Quarters in the public Hou&s;es he &s;hould take them: but then he could not an&s;werable for the good Order of his Men, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve, if they were intermixed with the Town People and &s;eperated from their Officers. I then interrupted and a&s;ked whether as the Colonel had now told them, that he mu&s;t and would march his Regiment into the Town, it would not be be&s;t to re|con&s;ider my Propo&s;al for fitting up the Manufactory Hou&s;e for a Barrack. It was ob&s;erved that it was not regular to put a Que&s;tion until the Board was cleared: The Gentle|men thereupon withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="011176_0035_0F862BED66100C90">
I then de&s;ired that in recon&s;idering my Propo&s;al for fitting up the Manufactory Hou&s;e, they would let me know what Objection they had to it: The only Objection worth Notice was that they had no Power to draw the Money. I told them that there was an Appropriation in the Trea&s;ury for contingent Services, which had much more Money upon it than would be wanted for this Bu&s;ine&s;s, which was a con|tingent Service. They &s;till declined it. I then told them that I would make one more Propo&s;al to them, which was, that if they would authorize me to fit up this Building, I would be an&s;werable it &s;hould be done at the Charge of the Crown. This al&s;o they refu&s;ed in writing, refering to their former An&s;wer. I then gave them to under&s;tand that tho&s;e Subterfuges would not di&s;appoint the Execution of the King's Commands; and that I by my&s;elf would a&s;&s;ign the Hou&s;e in Que&s;tion for a Barrack.</P>
<P>The next Morning when I got to the Ca&s;tle as u&s;ual to hold a further Con&s;ultation, Capt. Montre&s;or, an Engineer, arrived here, and brought Letters from General Gage, for me and the Colonel, wherein the General &s;ays, That by a Number of private <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from Bo&s;ton to New-York, and from the Narrative of the Proceedings of the Town Meeting at Bo&s;ton, it was reported and believed at New-York, that the People in and about Bo&s;ton had revolted, he therefore &s;ent Capt. Montre&s;or to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Forces as Engineer, and to enable them to recover and maintain the Ca&s;tle, &amp; &s;uch other Po&s;ts as they could &s;ecure. As Things were not &s;o bad as this came to, the Colonel thought proper upon the Authority of the&s;e new Orders, to alter his Plan, and land both Regi|ments at Bo&s;ton, without Lo&s;s of Time. I gave him a po&s;itive Order to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Manufactory Hou&s;e for one; and the other Regiment was to be encamped. This being Re&s;olved, the Fleet was immediately put into Motion, and by the next Morning commanded the whole Town&mdash;And this Day at Noon the Troops began landing, and were all paraded on the Common by Four in the After|noon, This was done not only without Oppo&s;ition, but with tolerable good Humor.&mdash;Thus this Bu&s;ine&s;s has been effected for the pre&s;ent, which would have had none of the&s;e Difficulties, nor have occa&s;ioned &s;uch a Parade, if it had not been for the undutiful Behaviour of the Council.</P>

<P>IN my Letter No. 25. I gave your Lord&s;hip an Account of the proceedings of the Convention, in this I propo&s;e to fini&s;h it. They &s;at exactly a Week, and their la&s;t Act I hereby &s;end your Lord&s;hip a printed Copy of, this and what I before &s;ent being all that has been printed. They have be&s;ides, as I am told, prepared a Petition to the King in the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame Terms as the former, and have &s;ent it to Mr. DeBerdt, with a long Letter of In&s;tructions, among which is, as is &s;aid, a Direction to give it into the King's own Hands. But I am not certain of this, as all this Bu&s;ine&s;s was done with a kind of Secrecy, into which it is &s;carce worth while to pry.</P>
<P>The chief Ob&s;ervation upon the&s;e Writings, is of their Moderation &s;o very different from the Temper of tho&s;e who called this Meeting. This is accounted for many Ways: many of the Deputies came down with In&s;tructions and Di&s;po&s;ition to prevent the Bo&s;toners involving the Province in the Con&s;equences of their own mad Devices: many of them were, from the Beginning &s;en&s;ible of the Impropriety and Danger of this proceeding, and were de&s;irous, by a moderate Conduct, to correct the One and ward off the other. My Me&s;&s;age (which was &s;aid to be very high, tho' I hope not too high for the Occa&s;ion) altho' it did not di&s;|per&s;e them, had the good Effect to keep them in Awe. Hence it was that &hellip;.., when he joined them, was perfectly came; and his Colleague Adams when he attempted to launch out in the Language u&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, was pre&s;ently &s;ilenced. And now the&s;e People a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Merit of the Moderation of tho&s;e whom they called together for very different purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>However therefore this temperate Conduct of the&s;e De|puties may in &s;ome Mea&s;ure apologize for the Towns who deputed them and for them&s;elves who a&s;&s;embled, it makes no Excu&s;e for tho&s;e who took upon them&s;elves to call them together. For whoever reads the Minutes of the Town-Meeting in which the &s;ummoning this Convention was or|dered, will ea&s;ily perceive that it was intended to have very different Effects from tho&s;e which it was i&s;&s;ued in.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Landing the two Regiments at Bo&s;ton on Saturday la&s;t with &s;uch di&s;patch and parade, which I informed Your Lord&s;hip of by No. 26, is like to have good Effects, and will at la&s;t, tho' it has not done it at pre&s;ent, produce Quar|ters for the Troops. On the Monday following I called the Council together, and laid before them a Requi&s;ition of Col. Dalrymple's for the u&s;ual Allowances under the Act of Par|liament. Again&s;t this it was argued that they were ready on their parts to comply with the Act of Parliament if the Col. would on his. If therefore the Col. would remove both the Regiments to the Ca&s;tle, they would provide the Allowances, otherwi&s;e not. This produced a good deal of Debate, after which I told them, that the Col. had de&s;ired that if they were di&s;po&s;ed to refu&s;e, he might be heard be|fore the Refu&s;al was made ab&s;olute, and I accordingly &s;ent for the Colonel.</P>
<P>He came with Capt. Smith, and I informed him of what was pa&s;&s;ing. He enforced his Requi&s;ition in very &s;trong Words, not without &s;ome Hints of the King's Re&s;entment which would follow their Refu&s;al. He &s;aid that he had en|camped one of the Regiments and was providing Barracks for the other, that they might be both con&s;idered to be in Barracks. If therefore they refu&s;ed the Allowances becau&s;e they were not in the Barracks at the Ca&s;tle, they took upon them&s;elves to determine upon the propriety of the King's &s;tationing His Troops at this or that place, and to pre&s;ume to di&s;pen&s;e with an Act of Parliament, unle&s;s the Troops were &s;tationed at &s;uch Places as they thought fit; altho' &s;uch propo&s;ed &s;tationing directly contradicted the Intention of the King's ordering the Troops to be &s;tationed here at all. This was the Sub&s;tance of the Colonel's and my own rea&s;oning upon the Occa&s;ion, which had much Weight, &s;o to induce the Council to de&s;ire me to give them Time to con&s;ider fur|ther of it; which I did upon their a&s;&s;uring me that they would draw up no more Papers for Publication; according|ly the Council was adjourned to this Day.</P>
<P>Upon this Day the Council met by them&s;elves in the Council Chamber, and two of the Council came to me to know if I could engage the Colonel to &s;end one of the Regi|ments to the Ca&s;tle, if they would provide for the other. I
<PB N="71" REF="011176_0036_0F862BEED8EFAAC0">
&s;aid, I could make no &s;uch Terms with the Colonel, but as he happened then to come in, they might hear from him|&s;elf. He &s;aid that his Orders were to &s;tation the two Regi|ments in the Town, but if Things were quiet, and the Troops well received and accommodated, he made no Doubt but the General would allow one Regiment to go to Ca&s;tle; for which Purpo&s;e he had already wrote. The Gentlemen returned to the Council, they continuing to &s;it by them&s;elves at the Council Chamber; when after many Debates it was determined to &s;upply the Troops by 8 again&s;t 5 in the Coun|cil then a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>Afternoon they came to me in a Body, and gave me an An&s;wer in Writing, wherein they re&s;olved that I &s;hould ap|point a Per&s;on to provide the Allowances, he undertaking <HI>"to run the Ri&s;que</HI> of the A&s;&s;embly paying the Charge of it." I told them that this Clau&s;e was di&s;abling as well as ena|bling; for by in&s;erting &s;uch a terrifying Provi&s;o, I &s;hould not be able to get any one to undertake it. If they meant nothing but to indemnify them&s;elves from being per&s;onally an&s;werable for this Charge, I would recommend this Clau&s;e "that &s;uch Provi&s;ion &s;hould be made on the Credit of the A&s;&s;embly, and not of the Particulars of the Per&s;ons compo|&s;ing the Governor and Council." Some Gentlemen approv|ed of this; but it was greatly oppo&s;ed, and it was urged that as there really was a great Ri&s;que that the A&s;&s;embly would not pay this Money, it was fitting that the Undertaker &s;hould know it; I a&s;ked them if the Troops were Barracked at the Ca&s;tle, whether they would have in&s;erted this Clau&s;e; they freely an&s;wered no, for then there would have been no doubt of the Legality of making &s;uch Allowances, now there was. I then told them that it plainly appeared that this di&s;cou|raging Clau&s;e was put in as a pre-judgment of what the A&s;&s;embly had to do in providing for this Expence, and a Dictation to them not to di&s;charge it: and &s;o it would by all knowing of this Proceeding. However, I in&s;i&s;ted upon the Que&s;tion of the Amendment I propo&s;ed being put, and it pa&s;&s;ed in the Negative. Upon which upon the unamended An&s;wer, I propo&s;ed a Per&s;on for Commi&s;&s;ary for this Pur|po&s;e; and he was approved. So here is a Subject for Di&s;|pute laid in Store again&s;t the next Meeting of the A&s;&s;em|bly.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="011176_0037_0F862BEEE4386660">
<HI>October</HI> 6.</P>
<P>This Morning I had with me Colonel Dalrymple&punc; and Mr. Godthwait the Per&s;on I appointed to make Provi&s;ion for the Troops. And being informed of the Terms upon which the Council had made this Appointment, Mr. Gold|thwait, with the Advice and Approbation of the Colonel, declined undertaking this Bu&s;ine&s;s; and the Colonel told me that he thought it was to no Purpo&s;e for me to apply any more to the Council upon this or any other Provi&s;ion for the Troops, for he &s;aw that they were determined to do no|nothing. And I mu&s;t add my&s;elf, that I am certain that the Provi&s;o was put in to defeat the whole Purpo&s;e. I am a&s;&s;ured that at fir&s;t they re&s;olved to make a po&s;itive Refu&s;al, and had drawn up near two Sheets of Paper of Arguments, to ju&s;tify this Refu&s;al. But this Paper being much excepted to, and generally di&s;approved, and a Vote being obtained to make a Provi&s;ion, the Opponents hit upon this Expedient to annul the Vote and render it ineffectual, and the Affirmers of the Vote with their Eyes open into this Expedient.</P>

<SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I FIND my&s;elf obliged to continue my Informations of the Council's Separation from and Oppo&s;ition to the Governor in the Execution of his Maje&s;ty's Commands. I &s;hould have been glad to have been excu&s;ed carrying the Account any further than where I have already laid it; but my Duty, and the Importance of the Subject, will not admit of my not proceeding.</P>
<P>In my Letter No. 24, I informed your Lord&s;hip that I had prevented the Publication of the Proceedings of the Council on July 27 and 29, la&s;t, by ordering the Secretary to deliver no Copies, thereof; which I then thought was an effectual Means of Prevention. Al&s;o in my Letter No. 28, I inform|ed that I con&s;ented to the Council's taking Time to con&s;ider of my Propo&s;al for their providing the Allowances for the Troops, upon their a&s;&s;uring me that they would draw up no
<PB N="73" REF="011176_0037_0F862BEEE4386660">
more Papers for Publication. And I might have added, that I expre&s;ly &s;tipulated that they &s;hould deliver into the Secretary's Hands <HI>all Papers</HI> which they &s;hould u&s;e upon this Occa&s;ion, without keeping <HI>any Copies</HI> thereof. And this Stipulation was, as I under&s;tood, unanimou&s;ly a&s;&s;ented to before we parted.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s there appeared on Monday la&s;t October 10th, in three of the News-Papers of that Day, a Publication of all the Proceedings on July 27th and 29th, and al&s;o the entire Minutes of Council on October 3d &amp; 5th, which are the Subject of the Stipulation before-mentioned. Upon my enquiring of the Secretary how the&s;e Papers came to be publi&s;hed, he &s;aid he under&s;tood that it was done <HI>by Order of the Council,</HI> but how they came by the Copies he did not know. He was &s;ure that no Copies came out of his Office; for he had kept the Originals in his own Cu&s;tody, and never &s;uffered them to be out of his Sight when they were in U&s;e.</P>
<P>The next Council Day October 12, I took an Opportunity to ob&s;erve upon this Publication, and reminded them of the A&s;&s;urances they had given that no Papers or Copies of Pa|pers &s;hould be kept out of the Cu&s;tody of the Secretary; and I de&s;ired to know from whom the Copies u&s;ed for the&s;e Publications were procured, as they did not come from the Secretary, and who committed them to the Pre&s;s? No An|&s;wer was given for the pre&s;ent; but when the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Council was over, and we had ro&s;e from the Table, Mr. <HI>Bowdoin,</HI> who upon this Separation of the Council has been the perpetual Pre&s;ident, Chairman, Secretary, and Speaker of this new Council, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, &s;aid that he was de&s;ired by the Council to inform me, that they had cau&s;ed this Publication, judging it nece&s;&s;ary to quiet the Minds of the People. Upon my ob&s;erving that they had promi&s;ed to keep no Copies of the Papers they had u&s;ed upon the la&s;t Occa&s;ion, he an&s;wered, that the Publication was not from Copies, but the Originals, I an&s;wered that they had promi&s;ed to deliver to the Secretary <HI>all</HI> Papers u&s;ed in that Bu&s;ine&s;s; but that I was obliged to him for being &s;o explicit; for their declaring that the Original Pa|pers of the&s;e Minutes of Council were with them, and that tho&s;e remaining with the Secretary were only Copies, was &s;uch an Avowal of their being a Board &s;eparate from and independant of the Governor, as I did not expect. But they were in the right to &s;peak out. I added that it might be doubted whether the Council by any &s;eparate Act of
<PB N="74" REF="011176_0038_0F862BEFA8481A70">
their own, could create a For&s;eiture of their Charter; but if they could, I &s;hould have no Doubt, but that their &s;epa|rating them&s;elves from the Governor, and acting as a com|pleat Body by them&s;elves, would amount to &s;uch a Forfeiture. And I either added, or had it &s;trongly in my Mind (I cannot &s;ay which) that the&s;e their Proceedings would probably be joined with other extraordinary Proceedings on the Part of the People, to infer a general Departure from the Con&s;titution of the Government, and an Inva&s;ion of the Royal Rights contrary to the Tenor of the Charter.</P>
<P>Mr. Bowdoin, in Ju&s;tification of him&s;elf and his A&s;&s;ociates, &s;aid that the People in their pre&s;ent Temper would not bear with the keeping the Proceedings in Council &s;ecret; for this Rea&s;on to quiet the People, they found them&s;elves obliged to make their Doings public, and could not &s;ubmit to an Injunction of Secrecy. I an&s;wered, that if they would &s;hew me any civilized Government upon Earth that did or could &s;upport it&s;elf under a continual and immediate Publication of the Re&s;ults of its mo&s;t intimate Councils, &s;o that before any of its Orders could be carried into Execution, they &s;hould be canva&s;&s;ed by Tavern Politicians, and cen&s;ured by News Paper Libellers, I would &s;ubmit to their Pre&s;criptions. But as I knew that Government could not be carried on upon the&s;e Terms, I &s;hould be obliged to de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty's In&s;tructions how to conduct my&s;elf under the&s;e Difficulties.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have before ob&s;erved that in opening this Coun|cil I ordered the Secretary to read the Oath of a Coun&s;ellor, Part of which is that <HI>they &s;hall not reveal what &s;hall be com|mitted to them in Secrecy;</HI> and I added that what I was now going to commit to them was in Secrecy. I added that I was &s;orry to ob&s;erve that &s;ome Matters which I had hereto|fore committed to them in Secrecy, had not only tran&s;pired, but been publi&s;hed, with the Particulars, which could not have been known abroad, if a due Regard had been had to the Oath. Upon this Mr. Bowdoin &s;aid that the Council were of Opinion that the Oath of Secrecy related only to &s;uch Matters as <HI>they</HI> &s;hould think and advi&s;e ought to be kept &s;ecret; and that the Governor had no Power to en|join them to Secrecy without their own Con&s;ent. I told them that this their Re&s;olution, which I now heard the fir&s;t of, was very extraordinary, for it argued, 1. That Matters committed <HI>to</HI> the Council in Secrecy &s;hould be committed by them&s;elves, which was a Contradiction in Terms; 2. That if Secrecy was not to be enjoined 'till after the Matters had
<PB N="75" REF="011176_0038_0F862BEFA8481A70">
been con&s;idered of and debated upon, they could not be <HI>committed</HI> in Secrecy; 3. That according to this, the Go|vernor could not commit any Matter in Secrecy to the Council, though enjoined by the King him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Merits of the &s;ubject Matter, your Lord&s;hip will ob&s;erve the extraordinary Circum&s;tance of a Coun&s;ellor denouncing to the Governor the Re&s;olution of the Council upon a Que&s;tion, or a Di&s;tinction of a Que&s;tion, which, though relative to the Conduct and Duty of the Council, was never moved or argued in Council before the Governor, and concerning which he has neither had an Opportunity to hear the Rea&s;ons which induced the Council to be of that Opinion, or to offer his own Rea&s;ons again&s;t it; and in Con&s;equence can make no Report of the Principles upon which &s;uch Opinion was founded.</P>
<P>Before I fini&s;h this Subject I mu&s;t mention a Fact of their Treatment of Mr. Oliver the <HI>King'</HI>s Secretary. This new Council met in the Council Chamber by them&s;elves, and by their own Appointment, and &s;ent for the Secretary. When he came, they examined him concerning an Entry in the Minutes of the Council, which to my Knowlege was read and approved of before they parted, but which, upon Recol|lection, did not &s;uit their Purpo&s;e, and therefore they di&s;|avowed.&mdash;During this Examination they kept him &s;tanding at the End of the Table, and at la&s;t a&s;ked him to &s;it down at the Bottom of the Table, he &s;aid, he knew of no Council where the Governor was not pre&s;ent, and withdrew.</P>
<P>Mr. Oliver, by his Rank in the Li&s;t of Coun&s;ellors, and the U&s;age of the Country, had a Right to take Place of much the greate&s;t Part of the Coun&s;ellors pre&s;ent, in all indifferent Places. But being full of their own &s;elf-a&s;&s;umed Dignity, they treated this Gentleman with a Rudene&s;s, which I &s;hould have been a&s;hamed to have &s;een practi&s;ed upon a Man of much le&s;s Rank and Merit, if I had been in the Chair.</P>
<P>The Difficulties I meet with in carrying His Maje&s;ty's Orders for Quartering the Troops into Execution, will, I fore&s;ee, occa&s;ion my being behind-hand in Letters due to your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>If therefore you &s;hould ob&s;erve in me a want of Punctu|ality, you mu&s;t not impute it to my Idlene&s;s; for I was never harder worked than I am at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>I HAVE received and laid before the King your Di&s;patches No. 29, 30, &amp; 31, and as every Circum&s;tance relative to the State of your Government is now before Parliament, I &s;hall hope to be able to &s;end you very &s;oon the Re&s;ult of their Proceedings. In the mean Time I am to acquaint you, that His Maje&s;ty approves your Conduct in every Part of it, and &s;ees with Concern and Di&s;&s;atisfaction, how greatly his Ser|vice is ob&s;tructed, and the Dignity and Spirit of His Govern|ment de&s;troyed, by the unwarrantable and unju&s;tifiable Be|haviour of the Council upon many Occa&s;ions, and more e&s;|pecially with Re&s;pect to Quartering His Maje&s;ty's Troops&punc; a Service in the facilitating of which they were called upon by every Con&s;ideration of Duty to the Crown, and of Re|gard to the Peace of the Public, to exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t of their Power.</P>

<P>I Have received and laid before the King your Di&s;patches No. 32 &amp; 33, which appear to contain only farther Ac|counts of the Ob&s;truction given by the Council to Govern|ment in general, and of their determined Re&s;olution to pur|&s;ue a Conduct that can have no other Effect than to defeat the Mea&s;ures His Maje&s;ty has thought fit to adopt, for re|&s;toring Peace and good Order in the Town of Bo&s;ton.</P>

As the State of the Province is &s;till under the Con&s;idera|tion of Parliament, I have nothing to add to what I have already &s;aid to you in my Letter No. 22 upon that Subject&punc; and have only to repeat to you, that as &s;oon as the Proceed|ings of Parliament are brought to a Conclu&s;ion, I &s;hall not fail to tran&s;mit to you the Re&s;ult of their Deliberations: In the mean Time, I am per&s;uaded there will be on your Part no Relaxation of that Attention to the Execution of your Duty, which does you &s;o much Credit, and that you will &s;teadily and firmly pur&s;ue every Con&s;itutional Mea&s;ure for the Support of His Maje&s;ty's Authority, and the Dignity of His Government.</P>

<P>HIS Maje&s;ty approves your Activity, and the Attention which you have &s;hewn to His Service in your Re&s;olu|tion to go to Bo&s;ton, and hopes that your Pre&s;ence there will greatly conduce to remove the Difficulties which have oc|curred in quartering the Troops, and to prevent any ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint on the Part of the Inhabitants, as well as to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Governor in reducing them to a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of their Duty, and in the Pre&s;ervation of the Peace and the Ex|ecution of the Laws, in which he appears, as far as the weak State of Government would admit, to have exerted a be|coming Spirit, and to have &s;hewn a due Regard to His Ma|je&s;ty's Service.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from the honorable Major-General Gage, to the Earl of Hill&s;borough, dated, Bo&s;ton, Nov. 3, 1768.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty's intentions Communicated to me in Your Lord&s;hip's Letter No. 12, re&s;pecting the Ship of War, which carries Lord Botetourt to his Government, and that which e&s;corts the Tran&s;ports to Bo&s;ton, has been made known to Commodore Hood, and I have acquainted the Com|modore with my Opinion that His Maje&s;ty's Service did re|quire tho&s;e Ships to remain in the American Seas. He is daily

expected here from Halifax and I hope to &s;ettle that Matter with him in Per&s;on, before I return to New-York.</P>
<P>Every thing now has the Appearance of Peace and Quiet in this Place, and I find &s;ome Pro&s;ecutions are commenced in the Court of Admiralty again&s;t two of the mo&s;t popular Lead|ers, who dared to violate the Laws in a very daring and open Manner; and it is hoped this Example will encourage the Civil Officers of every Degree to do their Duty without Fear, and to curb effectually the licentious and &s;editious Spirit which has &s;o long prevailed in this Place. Your Lord&s;hip will &s;ee that the Pre&s;ence of the Troops has already produ|ced &s;ome good Effects; and it appears very nece&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ty's Service, that both his Land and Sea Forces &s;hould be &s;trong in North America, for &s;ome Time to come; par|ticularly 'till the Affairs of America have been laid before Parliament, and the Re&s;olutions concerning the Colonies &s;hall be made known.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from the Earl of Hill&s;borough, to the honorable Major General Gage, dated Whitehall, Dec. 24, 1768.</HEAD>
<P>I Have this Day received and laid before the King your Di&s;patches from Bo&s;ton, dated the 31&s;t of October, and 3d &amp; 8th of November, numbered 18, 19 &amp; 20.</P>
<P>The Account contained in the&s;e Di&s;patches of the Conduct and Proceedings of the Council, and of the Inferior Magi&s;|trates at Bo&s;ton, upon the repeated Applications made to them for quartering his Maje&s;ty's Troops pur&s;uant to the Act of Parliament, is a farther Te&s;timony of the weak and di&s;ordered State of Government in the Province of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts Bay, and of the Di&s;po&s;ition that prevails in almo&s;t all Ranks of the People to ob&s;truct and embarra&s;s the King's Service, in a Ca&s;e in which His Maje&s;ty has &s;hewn &s;o great a Regard to the Peace and Security of a Town, where Go|vernment had been &s;o repeatedly in&s;ulted, and &s;et at Defiance.</P>
<P>As every Circum&s;tance relative to the State of the Pro|vince of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay is now before Parliament, I have only to expre&s;s to you his Maje&s;ty's Approbation of the Mea|&s;ures you have taken, in Concert with Governor Bernard, for providing for the Reception and Accommodation of the Troops during the Winter, and of the Caution you have u&s;ed to execute this Service in &s;uch a Manner as to avoid all Grounds of rea&s;onable Di&s;content, and to &s;ecure his Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="79" REF="011176_0040_0F862BF3FA08A4C8">
Officers from the Hazard to which the Uncertainty and want of Preci&s;ion in the Law might expo&s;e them in a Place where every Effect of Malice &s;eems to be exerted to en&s;nare and di&s;tre&s;s them.</P>
<P>For my own Part, I &s;hall not fail to &s;ubmit your Ob&s;erva|tions upon the Mutiny-Act to the Con&s;ideration of the re&s;t of His Maje&s;ty's Servants, and &s;hall be very happy if any Al|teration can be made therein, which without giving up the Principle, may render it more ea&s;y in the Execution, and le&s;s hazardous to the Officers.</P>
<P>As you appear to think that there is no Probability that any Inconveniency will ari&s;e from allowing the Provincial Garri&s;on to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ca&s;tle-William; the King is &s;atisfied with the Rea&s;ons you give for permitting them to remain in it for the pre&s;ent. What may be nece&s;&s;ary here|after in Re&s;pect to this Fortre&s;s, as well as to what you &s;ugge&s;t of building Barracks upon, and fortifying the Eminence be|hind Bo&s;ton, mu&s;t depend upon the future Conduct of that Town.</P>
<P>It has given great Plea&s;ure to the King to find by your Letter No. 19, that the Mea&s;ure of &s;ending Troops to Bo&s;ton, has been &s;o fully ju&s;tified by the Effects of it, which His Maje&s;ty hopes from the pre&s;ent Appearances, will finally produce that Spirit of Order and Obedience to lawful Go|vernment upon which the Happine&s;s and Security of Society depend.</P>

<P>I De&s;ired you would acquaint my Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty of my Arrival here the 15th, by a Ve&s;&s;el ju&s;t then about to &s;ail, Duplicate of which accompanies this.</P>
<P>Governor Bernard &s;ent me a Letter Ye&s;terday from Capt. Thomp&s;on, acquainting me of his Arrival in Hampton-Road in Virginia the 25th of la&s;t Month, with his Maje&s;ty's Ship Rippon under his Command, and that Lord Botetourt was landed the next Morning, and inclo&s;ing their Lord&s;hip's Order of the 25th of Augu&s;t, directing me, if the King's Service &s;hall in my Opinion require it, to take the &s;aid Ship under my Command, and employ her in &s;uch a Manner as I &s;hall judge be&s;t in the Execution of the Services intru&s;ted to my Care; but if Circum&s;tances of Affairs, &s;hall be &s;uch as to render her A&s;&s;i&s;tance unnece&s;&s;ary, to direct her Captain to repair without Lo&s;s of Time to Spithead, and to &s;end an Account of her Arrival to you: At pre&s;ent Things here are very quiet, and I flatter my&s;elf will remain &s;o, till the Re&s;olutions of Parliament are known, what turn they will then take, is uncertain. The Spirit of Oppo&s;ition to the Acts of Parliament of Great-Britain, is as high as ever, and general throughout the Colonies; it therefore &s;eems very prudent and nece&s;&s;ary to be as &s;trong in all Parts, and in all Re&s;pects as po&s;&s;ible; and there is no &s;aying now, how far the Rippon may be e&s;&s;entially &s;erviceable in the Spring. The pre&s;ent Sea&s;on is &s;uch as to render any Movements at Sea, of the King's Ships, very hazardous; and as the Di&s;tur|bances
<PB N="82" REF="011176_0042_0F862BF5A4FD44D0">
in Virginia and other Provinces to the Southward of this, are as great as they well can be, without actual Re|bellion. I have judged it right, upon con&s;ulting with Ge|neral Gage, to direct Captain Thomp&s;on to remain in Hamp|ton Road till further Orders, holding the Ship under his Command, in as great Readine&s;s for Service, as is con&s;i&s;tent with her Safety; for if Troops &s;hould be required to be carried from this Province to any other, or from any other to this, it is a Service not to be effected but in his Maje&s;ty's Ships, as Tran&s;port Ve&s;&s;els cannot be hired. The&s;e are my Rea&s;ons for detaining the Rippon in America, which I hope will prove &s;atisfactory to their Lord&s;hips; and if the Winter Re&s;olutions at Home (upon which the Obedience of the Co|lonies wholly depends) &s;hould re&s;tore Affairs here to any Degree of Order, I &s;hall immediately &s;end Capt. Thomp&s;on to England; and in the mean Time, if I &s;ee no Cau&s;e to the contrary, I &s;hall direct him to join me here, as &s;oon as the Severity of the Winter is over, by which he will be able to return Home with the greater Expedition, as the Po&s;t is five and twenty Days at &s;oone&s;t from this to Virginia, and very precarious from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The Hu&s;&s;ar and two Tran&s;ports are &s;till mi&s;&s;ing; I begin to be in Pain about them, as the Weather has been very tempe&s;tuous for many Days pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to remain here the Winter, keeping with me the Romney, Mermaid, two Sloops, and two Schooners; I have ordered the Gla&s;gow to Winter at Halifax, and a Schooner at Loui&s;bourg, a Sloop at Rhode-I&s;land, and the Deal-Ca&s;tle and a Schooner at New-York, where I &s;hall al&s;o &s;end another Frigate if the Hu&s;&s;ar &s;hould not arrive there; from the la&s;t Account of her, &s;he was without a Bow&s;prit, and from the Winds that have &s;ince prevailed, I do not ima|gine &s;he can reach this Port. She was &s;poke with &s;tanding in for Sandy-Hook about ten Days &s;ince, &s;o that I expect to hear of her Arrival by To-morrow's Po&s;t.</P>
<P>The Raven Tran&s;port which has Colonel Mackay on board, has been &s;poke with in Latitude 38. Longitude 66, with her Forema&s;t and Maintopma&s;t gone, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he is gone to the Southward.</P>

<P>I BEG you will be plea&s;ed to acquaint my Lords Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, that His Maje&s;ty's Ship Hu&s;|&s;ar is arrived at New-York; &s;he parted Company with two of the Tran&s;ports on the 30th of OCtober, between the I&s;lands of Madeira and Teneriffe, and with the other Six on the 3d of this Month, from Nece&s;&s;ity, by carrying away her Mizen-Ma&s;t and Main-top &s;ail-yard, which obliged her to carry Sail in a hard Gale of Wind at S .by W. &s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves very near the Shoals of Nantucket.

I have directed Capt.

Di&s;turbances &s;eem again to be renewed there, the General and Governor Bernard have been lately burnt in E&s;&s;igy, in a mo&s;t public Manner.</P>

<P>I HAVE had the Honour of writing to you very frequently of late, but as Affairs of this Country have been and &s;till are very intere&s;ting at Home, it mu&s;t be &s;atisfactory to their Lord&s;hips to hear often how they go; I beg now to acquaint you, that the People here are perfectly Quiet, and I am pretty &s;ure they will remain &s;o till the Re&s;olutions of Parliament are known, which I am in Hopes will re&s;tore Order and make it la&s;ting. There does not appear to me the lea&s;t Probability of the People's taking Arms. I think it cannot happen. Indeed &s;ome few of the Convention took Pains to bring the Ignorant and lower Cla&s;s into that Mind, and po&s;&s;ibly might have &s;ucceed had not the Troops arrived as they did; but tho&s;e few are now alarmed, and expect nothing le&s;s, than a Voyage to England again&s;t their Ineli|nations. The Council are now &s;itting without the Gover|nor, and preparing Addre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. to England; His Excel|lency has told them how uncon&s;titutional they act, but they &s;till go on. No account has yet been received of the Arrival of the Raven Tran&s;port with Colonel' Mackay on Board.</P>

<P>IN our former Memorials to your Lord&s;hips, we repre|&s;ented the Di&s;affection of the People here to the Revenue Laws, and from the many trea&s;onable Pub|lications that had been &s;pread through all the Provin|ces, and the Corre&s;pondence carried on by the &s;everal A&s;&s;emblies, we were per&s;uaded there had been a long con|certed and exten&s;ive Plan of Re&s;i&s;tance to the Authority of Great-Britain; and we believe, that the Seizure referred to in the inclo&s;ed Papers, has ha&s;tened the People of Bo&s;ton to the Commi&s;&s;ion of actual Violence &s;ooner than was intended.</P>
<P>From their outrageous Behaviour towards our Officers, and their repeated Threats of immediate Violence to our own Per&s;ons, we found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in Order to &s;ave His Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ion from further In&s;ult, and to pre&s;erve our Lives, to take &s;helter on Board His Maje&s;ty's Ship the Romney in Bo&s;ton-Harbour, from whence we are removed into Ca&s;tle-William to carry on the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Revenue; till we can receive &s;uch protection as will enable us to act in Safety at Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>We herewith lay before your Lord&s;hips Copies of our Minutes of the 13th and 14th In&s;tant, together with Copies of &s;everal Affidavits and Letters relative to our pre&s;ent Si|tuation agreable to the Schedule inclo&s;ed, and we beg Leave to &s;ubmit our Opinion, that nothing but the immediate Exertion of Military Power will prevent an open Revolt of

<P>MR. Harri&s;on, Collector of this Port, having laid before the Board on the 16th In&s;tant, an Information taken on Oath, &s;etting forth that the Tide&s;man placed on Board the Sloop Liberty, which arrived from Madeira on the 9th Day of May, had been forcibly confined on Board the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el, during which Time Part of the Cargo had been un|laden, before Entry thereof had been made at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e or Naval-Office, the Commi&s;&s;ioners referred the Matter to the Con&s;ideration of the Sollicitor; and in the Evening the Collector and Comptroller made Seizure of the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el, and delivered her into the Charge of the Ma&s;ter of his Maje&s;ty's Ship Romney, which lay near the Wharff where the Seizure was made, who immediately carried her along Side the &s;aid Ship, as there was a Mob a&s;&s;embled, who attempted to re&s;cue her.</P>
<P>The Collector and Comptroller, with the Son of the Col|lector, on their Return from the Wharff into Town, were attacked by a numerous and outrageous Mob, Mr. Irving, In&s;pector of Imports and Exports, who happened to be pa&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Way in his Return from the Wharff was likewi&s;e attacked by the Mob, who cried out, he is a Commi&s;&s;ioner, Kill him, Kill him; The&s;e &s;everal Per&s;ons were gro&s;ly in|&s;ulted, and much brui&s;ed, and e&s;caped with the utmo&s;t Ha|zard of their Lives, the Collector having been confined to his Bed and in great Danger from a Blow he received on his Brea&s;t with a Stone or Brick-bat thrown at him, and the Comptroller having been likewi&s;e confined to his Hou&s;e under the Care-of a Surgeon, from the Wounds and Brui&s;es he received; after the&s;e Violences committed on the Per&s;ons

of the Officers, the Mob proceeded to the Hou&s;es of the Collector and Comptroller, broke their Windows and tho&s;e of Mr. Williams In&s;pector General, and they concluded the Night with dragging the Collector's Boat from the Wharff through the Town to the Common, where they burnt it.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e Outrages were committing, the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers had every Rea&s;on to expect they &s;hould meet with the like In&s;ults, and therefore retired from their Hou&s;es, taking Shelter 'till after Midnight with their Families in the Hou&s;es of &s;ome Per&s;ons in their Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Early on the next Day, the Governor acquainted the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners that the Council would meet on the Affair of the Riot of the preceding Evening, and de&s;ired if the Board had any Thing to communicate to them thereon, that it might be laid before them; upon which the Chairman &s;ummoned the Commi&s;&s;ioners to meet, it not being a Board Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Copy 3.4.5.6</NOTE> when they wrote a Letter to Governor Ber|nard and the Collector, Comptroller, Mr. Irving and young Mr. Harri&s;on having &s;ent to the Board their Affidavits on this Affair, the Commi&s;&s;ioners immediately directed the Secretary to lay them before the Go|vernor in Council.<NOTE PLACE="marg">&mdash;7.</NOTE>&mdash;The Board received a Letter from Mr. Oliver Secretary of the Province, acquaint|ing them, that the Enquiry into the Affair of the Riot was referred to a Committee of the Council to be reported on Monday.</P>

<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners, con&s;idering this Application as a Me|nace, and finding no Mea&s;ures had been taken by the Go|vernor and Council for &s;ecuring the Peace of the Town, and the Governor having repeatedly told the Commi&s;&s;ioners that he could give them no Protection, and that he would not ap|ply to General Gage for Troops, unle&s;s the Council advi&s;ed

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honorable Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CONSIDERING my&s;elf in &s;ome Re&s;pects under your Protection, I beg Leave to lay before you the follow|ing &s;hort Account of an Attack made upon my Per&s;on la&s;t Night.</P>
<P>Returning by my&s;elf from the End of the Long Wharff in the Evening about nine o'Clock, I was attacked by a con&s;iderable Number of di&s;orderly People, who, after laying violent Hands on me, demanded if I belonged to the Man of War? To which I an&s;wered I did not. Their next Que&s;tion was, whether I belonged to the Board of
<PB N="94" REF="011176_0048_0F862BFB03E7C950">
Commi&s;&s;ioners, which I an&s;wered in the Affirmative. They then began to beat me with Clubs, Sticks, &amp;c. but &s;ome of the Ringleaders interpo&s;ing, and a&s;&s;uring me of their Protection, I walked pretty quietly up among&s;t them to that Part of the Wharff adjoining King-Street, where the Mob returning with me was joined by another of much &s;uperior Numbers. This Mob after dragging me from among&s;t my former Friends, &s;eized me by the Hair, Arms, &amp;c. whil&s;t others were beating me upon the Head with Clubs, calling out to murder or kill me. In this di&s;a|greeable Situation two Men meanly dre&s;&s;ed took Compa&s;&s;ion upon me, and with great Difficulty pulling me from among&s;t the Croud, got me conveyed through a Hou&s;e into a back Yard, and from thence into another Hou&s;e, where I remain|ed until the Mob moved me to &s;ome other Part of the Town.

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from the Collector and Comptroller of Bo&s;ton, to the Chairman, June 12, 1768.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE beg Leave to inform you in an&s;wer to your Letter, that the Propo&s;al made to us on Behalf of Mr. Han|cock, is, that the Sloop Liberty that has been &s;eized, and now under the Protection of the Romney Man of War, &s;hall be returned to Mr. Hancock's Wharff, and &s;uffered to lie there, till the Affair is i&s;&s;ued in the Court of Admiralty, and that he, Mr. Hancock, will give Security, that the &s;aid Sloop &s;hall be at forthcoming and re-delivered to us, in Ca&s;e the Decree &s;hall be in our Favour.</P>
<P>The Sub&s;tance of the &s;everal Informations we have had re&s;pecting the Stipulations in Behalf of the Mob, is, that a De&s;ign was formed, and concerted for a general In&s;urrection or A&s;&s;embly la&s;t Night, and in Con&s;equence thereof large Numbers of People were actually gathered together, and re|gularly formed into Parties under their re&s;pective Leaders in &s;everal Parts of the Town. That the Rea&s;on given for this Proceeding was to oblige by Force tho&s;e concerned in the Seizure to return the Sloop Liberty to the Wharff from whence &s;he had been taken. As the Con&s;equence of that Attempt might have been a general Outrage, or perhaps a Pillage of every Per&s;on concerned in the Cu&s;toms, and of tho&s;e who are accounted their Friends and Abettors; it has alarmed &s;everal Gentlemen of the Town, and induced them to make the Propo&s;al abovementioned for returning the Sloop to Mr. Hancock's Wharff, and to give Time for a Negociation to that Purpo&s;e, it was &s;tipulated with the principal Leaders and Managers of the Mob, that no farther Outrages &s;hould be committed, but that the People &s;hould remain quiet till Monday Night, which was the longe&s;t Term that could be obtained of them.</P>
<P>It appears evident to us, that a Plan for an In&s;urrection, of a very dangerous and exten&s;ive Nature, has long been in Agitation, and now brought nearly to a Cri&s;is; and that to put it in Execution, there was only wanting &s;ome Step to be taken by the Officers of the Cu&s;toms, that might be made a Handle of to Inflame the Minds of the People, which this Seizure has furni&s;hed them with.</P>
<P>Upon the whole we can only ob&s;erve, that as the Powers of Government in this Country, are in &s;o weak and ener|vated a State, and the Mob, by what we can learn, deter|mined upon their point, we &s;hould con&s;ider it as a Mea&s;ure

of Policy in the pre&s;ent Dilemma to take Mr. Hancock's Security, and relea&s;e the Sloop for the Pre&s;ervation of the Officers, and Tranquility of the Town, which we have Rea|&s;on to believe would otherwi&s;e be greatly endangered.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honorable Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Depo&s;itions, which we laid before your Honours, on the 11th In&s;tant, concerning the outrageous Man|ner in which we were attacked, and treated on the preceed|ing Evening, after making Seizure of the Sloop Liberty be|longing to Mr. Hancock, will be&s;t de&s;cribe what happened on that Occa&s;ion, and by our Letter of the 12th your Ho|nours will have ob&s;erved the inflamed Temper of the Peo|ple, and the Stipulations that were demanded for a Truce until the Monday; after which Period they &s;eemed deter|mined to take their own Mea&s;ures for Redre&s;s; the Event however has manife&s;ted that the Peace and Tranquility of the Town was not the Object they meant to &s;eek after; for no A&s;&s;urance was &s;ent on the Part of Mr. Hancock, either verbally or in writing, that he would agree to any Stipula|tions for the re-delivery of the Sloop; and we are of Opinion, that it was no Part of their De&s;ign to let go this Plea for breaking out into open Violence.</P>
<P>After the ruffian Treatment we had experienced on the Friday Evening, merely for executing our Duty, the Stipu|lation broke thro', knowing the prever&s;ene&s;s of the People, and the Temper of the Times, our Lives threatned, and hearing that even your Honours had been obliged to &s;eek Refuge on Board His Maje&s;ty's Ship in the Harbour, our own Safety's became a Con&s;ideration of a very &s;erious Na|ture. The Collector has had an Intimation, that he would be laid hold of by way of Reprizals and the Inveteracy again&s;t the Comptroller is &s;o general and confirmed, that they have both been obliged to leave the Town, and &s;eek for any A&s;ylum from the Fury of a di&s;tracted and enraged Mul|titude.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Collector is left in charge of his De|puty Mr. Sheaffe, and the Comptroller's with his Clerk, both capable of duly executing their re&s;pective Offices, &s;o long as any Officer belonging to the Cu&s;toms &s;hall be &s;uffered to re|main in this Place. But it is with deep Concern that we acquaint your Honors, of what we hear repeatedly from all Quarters, which is, that a general Spirit of In&s;urrection pre|vails, not only in the Town, but throughout the whole Pro|vinces;

<P>The Ferment among&s;t the People has greatly encrea&s;ed &s;ince the 10th In&s;tant, and we are per&s;uaded, that their Leaders will urge them to the mo&s;t violent Mea&s;ures, even to open Revolt; for one of their Demagogues in a Town-Meeting Ye&s;terday, &s;aid, if they were called on to Defend their Liberties, and Privileges, he hoped and believed they would one and all Re&s;i&s;t, even unto Blood.</P>

<P>AT Three Clock this Afternoon there was a very nu|merous Meeting of the Inhabitants of the Town of Bo&s;ton at Faneuil-Hall, when James Otis, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was cho&s;en Moderator. But before he came to the Hall, a Motion was made to exclude the Tide Waiters from being pre&s;ent, &s;eve|ral of them being then in the Meeting, but 'twas objected to, as having no Right to &s;uch a Proceeding, and that it would be be&s;t, every one &s;hould hear what was to be offered. When the Moderator came, he was u&s;hered into the Hall by an almo&s;t univer&s;al Clap of Hands. By this Time the Hall be|ing quite full, and a great number being Out&s;ide, the Meet|ing was adjourned from the Hall to Dr. Sewall's Meeting-Hou&s;e, as being much larger for that Purpo&s;e. The Doors of the Meeting-Hou&s;e were &s;oon opened, and the People crowded in, when Silence being called, a Motion was made, that a Paper in the Hands of one of the Select-Men might be read, which was a Petition of the Inhabitants of the Town of Bo&s;ton to His Excellency Governor Bernard, in which was repre&s;ented the Difficulties and Burthens the Town la|bours under; in particular with Regard to His Maje&s;ty's Ship Romney, now in our Harbour, and praying his Excellency would cau&s;e the &s;aid Ship to be removed; and a Committee of 21 Per&s;ons was cho&s;en to wait on his Excellency the Governor immediately at his Seat at Roxbury with the afore&s;aid Petition, and the &s;aid Committee are gone accordingly. In the &s;aid Petition Complaint was al&s;o made of the unlimited Power of the Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, and other Grievances; notwith&s;tanding little el&s;e was &s;aid about the Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, or the Riot that happened la&s;t Friday Evening. A Motion was then made, that the Meeting be adjourned till to-morrow Afternoon 4 o'Clock, which was agreed to by a large Majority, the Moderator fir&s;t making a Speech to the Inhabitants, &s;trongly recommend|ing Peace and good Order, and the Grievance the People labour under might in Time be removed; if not, and we were called on to defend our Liberties and Privileges, he hoped and believed we &s;hould one and all re&s;i&s;t even unto Blood; but, at the &s;ame Time, prayed Almighty God it might never &s;o happen.

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from a Gentleman of Character, dated Bo&s;ton, June 14th, 1768.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR.&mdash;this Morning delivered your kind Me&s;|&s;age; I am &s;incerely &s;orry for the III-behaviour of the People, which mu&s;t terminate in their Ruin and De&s;truc|tion.&mdash;There certainly is, among &s;ome of the mo&s;t wicked and abondoned, a &s;ettled Scheme to oppo&s;e even the King's Troops landing, if that &s;hould be attempted, and they are endeavouring to get the Country to join in that mo&s;t profli|gate and vile Undertaking; however, I think it is beyond all Doubt, but tho&s;e of Property, and the better Sort of People among us, will di&s;countenance &s;uch intolerable Mad|ne&s;s; and will, notwith&s;tanding the malicious and unrea&s;on|able Efforts of a few, lo&s;t to all Sen&s;e of Gratitude to their Mother Country, de&s;perate in their Fortunes, and in &s;hort devoid of all Principles except &s;uch as are peculiar to Devils, exert them&s;elves again&s;t &s;uch a Mea&s;ure, as &s;oon as they dare act in Conformity to their own Judgment.</P>
<P>It is my Opinion, that the Promoters of the pre&s;ent Evils are ready to unma&s;k, and openly di&s;cover their long and latent De&s;ign to rebel, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to involve this mi&s;er|able Country in Blood and Horror. Heaven avert the Evil! to commit to Writing the various Methods, by which they delude the ignorant and per&s;uade the vicious, would be ex|tremely tedious; but in general, nothing is left undone to accompli&s;h both.</P>
<P>One of their grand Objects is to &s;pread the Infection, and thereby bring all the Colonies to the very verge of a ge|neral revolt; if they are di&s;appointed in this, their Projects will drop of Cour&s;e.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I &s;till am, and will continue to be, Dear Sir, Your &s;incere Friend, and mo&s;t obedient Servant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>IT is with the utmo&s;t Concern, that I ob&s;erve a great Un|ea&s;ine&s;s and unu&s;ual Sourne&s;s in the Minds of the People in general; have much Grieved at the publick Abu&s;es of &s;ome great Per&s;onages among us, who, to &s;ay no more, have merited very different Treatment. Much might be &s;aid on that Head; but to pur&s;ue what was more immedi|ately in my Mind; I don't know, but fear, that the uproar of Friday Night is but a prelude of greater Di&s;turbances. And, Sir, as my regards for you are unfeigned, I would ju&s;t hint what I have noticed from the &s;everal Quarters, &amp;c. The People, as a People, are exceedingly aver&s;e to the Gentlemen of the Honorable Board of Commi&s;&s;ioners.&mdash;I have heard your Name oftene&s;t mentioned.&mdash;I have obviated many Things, and anticipated others, to the utmo&s;t of my poor Abilities.&mdash;I know that the&s;e convul&s;ions among the&s;e Peo|ple mu&s;t give you Unea&s;ine&s;s: but rou&s;e your Philo&s;ophy.&mdash;I fear there will be more confu&s;ion, tho' I do but gue&s;s, for I am in no Secret; yet at the &s;ame Time he that runs may read, that without &s;ome &s;peedy Interpo&s;ition a great Storm will ari&s;e; which God avert.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;incerely concerned to learn by Your Letter of the 15th In&s;tant, delivered to me by Mr. Elliot, Collector of this Port, that the Turbulent State of Affairs in the City of Bo&s;ton has laid you under the Nece&s;&s;ity to take Shelter at Ca&s;tle-William, and to have Occa&s;ion for the Aid of His Maje&s;ty's Forces.</P>
<P>My Inclination would lead me to Order Troops to march immediately for your Protection; but you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that it would be highly improper in me to Order Troops into a Province for the Purpo&s;e of quelling Riots, unle&s;s Application &s;hould be fir&s;t made to that End by the Civil Power.</P>
<P>I have yet heard nothing on this Subject from Governor Bernard, who mu&s;t be be&s;t acquainted with the Situation of Affairs in his Province, and the propere&s;t Judge how far &s;uch a Mea&s;ure would be expedient and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The Moment he applies to me for the Aid of the King's Forces to &s;upport His Maje&s;ty's Government on this or any other Occa&s;ion, they &s;hall move to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance with as much Di&s;patch as it &s;hall be po&s;&s;ible for them to do, and as many of them as he can in Rea&s;on demand.</P>
