<P>AS the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and pre&s;ervation of every ble&s;&s;ing that is dear to you call for it: May I be permitted to ob&s;erve that the happine&s;s of life, e&s;pecially to men free born, con&s;i&s;teth in the full enjoyment of their <HI>natural,</HI> civil and religious RIGHTS. The&s;e are the nerves of health, the bul|warks of &s;trength, and pillars of peace: Upon this foundation ALONE, the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of the people &s;tands. So dear is this ble&s;&s;ing, that all life, power and &s;acred argument, unite in ONE to con|firm it. <HI>Skin for &s;kin, and all that a man hath will he give for his Life;</HI> for the very LIFE of LIFE is LIBERTY.

but a living death?&mdash;Nature breathes freedom through all the beauties of creation, from the meane&s;t in&s;ect that moves, to the fowl of the air, and the fi&s;h of the &s;ea. Freedom is that very breath of life that GOD <HI>breathed into man when he became a living &s;oul:</HI> Therefore every man has the &s;ame natural and inherent right to every ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>freedom</HI> and LIBERTY, as he has to his own, exi&s;tence, and whoever deprives him of the enjoyment of his NATURAL RIGHT, is, in &s;criptural language, a <HI>mur|derer.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. iii. 15.</NOTE> For the inviolable pre&s;ervation of the RIGHTS of the people, is &s;o happy in the <HI>Engli&s;h con&s;titution,</HI> that no law can be made, but by the united power of the King, Lords, and Commons. The whole <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> authority is only a power of guardian-&s;hip or high <HI>tru&s;t</HI> committed to them by the PEOPLE for the &s;ecure pre&s;ervation and admini&s;trati|on of their RIGHTS. And this deligated power is &s;ubject to be revoked whenever the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them is <HI>violated,</HI> as they are no more than the peo|ple's <HI>Servants,</HI> in the high tru&s;t of power, to main|tain the rights of their <HI>Charter;</HI> and whenever this end is not an&s;wered by them, the people have a right to turn them out of their <HI>&s;teward&s;hip,</HI> and di&s;|po&s;e of it to tho&s;e whom they &s;hall think fit guardi|ans of their RIGHTS; for the law of nature is <HI>&s;elf pre&s;ervation,</HI> which will never be relingui&s;h'd by a people of any &s;oul or &s;pirit.</P>
<P>As the whole authority and power of the King, Lords, and Commons, as a legi&s;lative body, is <HI>origi|nally,</HI> and <HI>authoritatively,</HI> the power and rights of the people, &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ting in them only by the people's plea|&s;ure

and power, which right, and power will always remain in the people if government was di&s;&s;olved; and this makes it lawful in them to re&s;i&s;t whatever oppo&s;es their inherent RIGHTS, authority, and power.</P>
<P>THE power of the King is &s;o &s;ettled by the authori|ty of the people, that he is then, and only then &s;e|cure, great, and happy while he maintains the laws and rights of the &s;ubjects. The King can neither make, or &s;uffer to be made, by any authority what|ever, any breach upon the rights of the people, but at the &s;ame time HE makes the &s;ame breach upon his own rights, and thereby de&s;troys the dignity and &s;ecurity of his CROWN: So that it remains a &s;ettled point, that the happine&s;s of the King, and the pro&s;pe|rity of the people intirely depends upon this, namely, the King's pre&s;erving inviolable firm (according to his coronation oath) the laws, rights and previledges of the &s;ubjects; for if the King breaks this binding engagement, he thereby loo&s;es his original right to REIGN; nay, every plea of right, and power of authority, by which he holds his CROWN, or a&s;cend|ed, the Briti&s;h THRONE. For the right of the King to reign upon the throne of Great-Britain, lies in his being (by the happy revolution principles) &s;ettled by the choice of the people as their elect King, or guardian of their rights.</P>
<P>BUT when the&s;e walls (which are the walls of &s;alvation to the people) are broken down, either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Kingly, or Parliamentary power, then the King right to reign, and the obligations of the people to the King, or mini&s;try, may ju&s;tly cea&s;e. For when the
<PB N="8" REF="013014_0006_0F8FB02B8715EB48">
rights of the people are violated, their affections not only become alienated, but their oath of allegiance to the K&mdash;him&s;elf becomes void.</P>
<P>THEN you will &s;ay, why are all the&s;e complaints of a free election being controul'd?&mdash;A repre&s;enta|tive denied?&mdash;Murderers protected?&mdash;Juries with|held?&mdash;Magna Charta de&s;troyed?&mdash;Remon&s;trances unheard?&mdash;The laws and rights of the people vio|lated? For, if the &s;upreme power of authority lies in the rights of the people, and the&s;e rights are held by the threefold cord of the King, Lords, and Com|mons, who then can break them?</P>
<P>THIS que&s;tion brings the matter to a point; and will &s;hew the original cau&s;e of all the com|plaints, both of the Britons, and Americans. And the an&s;wer is, there is an overuling arbitrary power,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some term it an <HI>enormous up&s;tart</HI> power, or mini&s;terial reign, over the RIGHTS of the people.</NOTE> which ab&s;olutely controuls the King, Lords, and Commons:&mdash;This is the u&s;urped power that is the &s;pring, and cau&s;e of all the di&s;tre&s;&s;e&s;s and complaints of the people in England, or in America; it is a kind of a fourth power, that the con&s;titution knows nothing of, or has not provided again&s;t. It is true, the people have &s;uffered, or admitted the King, to choo&s;e his privy coun&s;el, mini&s;ters and favourites, but they never intended they &s;hould rule over them, in any re&s;pect, much le&s;s in the violation of their rights. This mini&s;terial <HI>throne,</HI> or arbitrary power, is what the people wi&s;h to &s;ee de&s;troyed; becau&s;e they ex|tend their u&s;urped authority infinitely too far, either for the &s;afety of the King, or the good of the people:
<PB N="9" REF="013014_0007_0F8FB02CA1B5DE18">
So that it is plain to the people, that nothing but a change of men, and mea&s;ures, will &s;ave the nation from ruin: For the Briti&s;h Crown always totters when the rights of the people &s;hake.</P>
<P>THIS mini&s;terial power, are a union of gentlemen, both of Lords and Commons, who, it is to be feared, that few of them fear GOD, or regard Man. The&s;e are (unhappy for the people) favoured to be around the King, as his council, favourites and flatterers; and they not acting as the guardians of the Briti&s;h Crown, and the <HI>rights of the people,</HI> but acting in the affairs of the nation by their di&s;potic will, making it the rule of authority and power: The peo|ple are ju&s;tly alarmed at their actions, &s;ince they mu&s;t intend thereby &s;uch a change in government, that mu&s;t effectually de&s;troy their rights, if not produce an en|tire revolution of the whole State. For their power and intere&s;t is &s;o great, that they can, and do pro|cure whatever laws they plea&s;e; having, (by power, intere&s;t, and the application of the people's money, to <HI>placemen,</HI> and <HI>pen&s;ioners,</HI>) the whole legi&s;lative authority at their command. So that it is plain, (not to &s;ay a word of a particular reigning arbitrary <HI>Stuarthal</HI> power among them) that the rights of the people are ruined, and de&s;troyed by mini&s;terial <HI>tyran|nical</HI> authority; and thereby, in a great mea&s;ure, the people have lo&s;t the grand intent of their royal char|ter, and are become a kind of &s;laves to the mini&s;ters of State, the people having forgot the feeling &s;en&s;ation of their original right that it is &s;till remaining in them; yet, no doubt but their &s;oul and &s;entiment, their life and &s;pirit, as Britons, will again rou&s;e, and recover the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; &s;ince now to remon&s;trate to the

The&s;e are called, (but fal&s;ly &s;o called) <HI>friends to Government.</HI></P>
<P>BUT will the &s;pirits of Britons bear this? No! not long. Oh England, how near is thy ruin? who&s;e prerogative it was to give laws to Kings, and power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Nations.</P>
<P>WAS this all, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I would, with &s;ympathy of &s;oul, be &s;olemnly &s;ilent in tears, for the breaches, inrodes, and growing ruins of England: But as it is too notorious before GOD, and Man, that this is nearly thy ca&s;e, Oh America, that the Briti&s;h mini&s;terial power, by an unju&s;t &s;overeignty, they claim over you, have already de&s;troyed your rights!&mdash;Thrown down your liberties!&mdash;De&s;pi&s;ed your charter!&mdash;Depriv|ed you of your &s;pirit of trade, nay, of your lives!!! But what is wor&s;e, they are now aiming at the final overthrow of all your RIGHTS as a people; did I &s;ay <HI>aiming?</HI> Have they <HI>not already</HI> de&s;troyed the an|cient rights of your <HI>forefathers,</HI> which was the life and glory of America? Namely, the power of mak|ing your own laws, and right of di&s;po&s;ing your own money? This natural right, the Briti&s;h mini&s;try have violently attacked, and done their utmo&s;t to de&s;troy.</P>

you? And if the mini&s;try &s;hall think it nece&s;&s;ary for their ba&s;e purpo&s;e, may we not expect the COUNCIL, and all executive courts will be made independent al&s;o? Allow them this, and the golden key of the rights of America, is then in the hands of the real enemies of every ble&s;&s;ing, and liberty that you po&s;&s;e&s;s, as a body politic. Your laws, (not to &s;ay your lives) are then no more your own, as Juries naturally follow Judges. Allow them an influence here, and you are not only born to bring your grey hairs, with &s;orrow, to the grave,&mdash;but your children, (if you tamely &s;ubmit) in&s;tead of calling you ble&s;&s;ed, will be ready to &s;ay with the prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> <Q>Cur&s;ed be the day wherein I was born; let not the day wherein my mother bear me be ble&s;&s;ed: Cur&s;ed be the man that brought tidings to my father, &s;aying, that a man child is born making him very glad; where|fore came I forth out of the womb to &s;ee labour, and &s;orrow; that my days &s;hould be con&s;umed with &s;hame.</Q></P>
<P>THEREFORE, with all the tremendiou&s;ne&s;s of dan|ger, with all the &s;olemnities of fear, with all the pathos of affection let me intreat you as men of re|fined, and ready under&s;tanding, to &s;ee that your rights, your lives, your lands, are all in danger; your rights, as you are taxed without your con&s;ent; your lives, as witne&s;s the bloody ma&s;&s;acre in your &s;treets; witne&s;s the <HI>exile,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So called in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, by a great Commoner.</NOTE> but military force in your ca&s;tle, to rule over you and your children with the bloody authority of WAR.&mdash;Your lands, as no doubt a land tax is preparing, or &s;oon will be pre|pared for you.&mdash;And will the re&s;pectable Ame|ricans,

Let your own laws, your rights, your children's rights, and birthrights, in&s;pire you with life, &s;oul, and &s;enti|ment to let the King of England the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment, or mini&s;try know, nay, your own governor, and judges know your power, and importance as a people; that you will not lo&s;e your rights; that you will not be oppre&s;&s;ed or impo&s;ed upon by Lord BUTE's di&s;potic dictation in the Cabinet, or by any of the &s;pirit or blood of the <HI>Stuart'</HI>s family, which flows through the veins of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, that you will &s;ooner lo&s;e your lives than your liberties. A&s;k them in the name of the Mo&s;t High, what right, either by the law of GOD, of nature, or of nations, they have to rule over you? Speak to them as bre|thren, as peers, and as men of equal authority with them&s;elves: And a&s;k,</P>
<P>WHAT right have they to tax you without your leave?&mdash;Or what right have they to de&s;troy your freedom as a people? Know this, the King of England has no right to do it, it is beyond his authority, as King; nay, his attempt to do it de|&s;troys at once his right to reign over you.&mdash;The hou&s;e of Commons have no right to do it; they are not your repre&s;entatives, nor members of this com|munity: And where they have no right (nor can they have any) of repre&s;entation, they can have none of taxation.&mdash;The hou&s;e of Lords cannot do it; for they are Peers of England, and not of America. This, Lord CHATHAM, and Lord CAMDEN, have boldly, as true friends to the freedom of Engli&s;h|men, declared, "that the Briti&s;h Parliament has no
<PB N="13" REF="013014_0011_0F8FB03163E97F28">
right to tax America; and that the mini&s;try are rebels to GOD, and the laws and rights of nature, in their attempting to do it, and therefore ought to be treat|ed as &s;uch by every man of &s;entiment, or &s;pirit of liberty": For who would nor oppo&s;e, with his whole &s;oul, &s;uch con&s;ummate tyranny, inju&s;tice, and robbery as this?&mdash;Tyranny to the la&s;t degree, to a&s;&s;ume a power of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, taxing, and com|manding his Maje&s;ty's American &s;ubjects: A pow|er which his Maje&s;ty cannot give; nor can the Briti&s;h Parliament it&s;elf in ju&s;tice a&s;&s;ume it. And yet the&s;e men, contrary to law, and rea&s;on, will dare to do it in the face of their King, as to his &s;afety, in the face of their country, as to their happine&s;s, and in the face of your rights, as Americans, at the expence of your liberties to enrich them&s;elves.</P>
<P>AND will the Americans bear this? Have you not your own laws? Your own repre&s;entatives? Your own judges? And your own council? Why then &s;hould they command you? Is it not enough for the Americans to feed and &s;upport England with their trade? (And are willing &s;o to do until the Engli&s;h &s;treets are paved with American gold) but mu&s;t they give away their rights, their forefather's rights, and their children's rights to a &s;et of Mini&s;terial Vul|tures?&mdash;Heaven forbid it.</P>
<P>FOR be it known that the Americans, according to the &s;pirit of their original compact with the King, are a perfect <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> within them&s;elves, and have no connection, as to government, but only with the King of England, as their King, to &s;ign and ratify

&s;uch laws, and immunities as the Americans may con&s;ent unto by their own repre&s;entatives.

Loo&s;e this power, and you are no longer <HI>free men,</HI> nor happy &s;ubjects, but <HI>American SLAVES.</HI> And why &s;hould the&s;e people, who were never in bondage to any man, be in a &s;tate of &s;lavery to any power upon the earth? when you cannot but know, that your oath of allegiance, and obedience, to the King, is only due to him, and to be continued by you; as he acts upon his coronation oath to maintain, inviolable firm, your rights, laws and liberties, as the fulfilment of that &s;overeign Kingly power, you have repo&s;ed in him, as the royal tru&s;tee of your rights; for if your rights are infringed, yet the power of rights, laws, and liberties, &s;till revolves in you as a people; then &s;urely no man, but he who is contented, (like that animal called an ASS, to be born a fool, and die a &s;lave) will be &s;ilent, if every thing valuable in life is taken from him by that PERSON, who &s;tands engaged, in a &s;acred oath, to defend him. What &s;hould we &s;ay of a father who either oppre&s;&s;ed his children, or his children's children, for his own emolument? What &s;hould we call him? Or rather, what &s;hould we not call him? For does not nature teach us that he &s;hould rather in|dulge his children, than &s;tretch his authority?</P>
<P>WILL not &s;uch arbitary proceedings tend im|mediately to alienate the affections of his Maje&s;ty's American &s;ons, and give them cau&s;e to look upon him as an enemy to their happine&s;s, and as one (by

And therefore if the life of liberty, and the &s;ecurity of their rights call for it, no doubt (if the &s;pirit of their fore|fathers remain in them) but they will think that they have as ju&s;t a right, before GOD and man, to oppo&s;e King, Mini&s;try, Lords, and Commons of England, when they violate their rights, as Ameri|cans, as they have to oppo&s;e any foreign enemy: and that this is no more, according to the law of nature, to be deemed rebellion, than it would be to oppo&s;e the King of France, &s;uppo&s;ing him now pre|&s;ent invading the land.</P>

<P>THIS has been the &s;afety of princes&mdash;the &s;ecurity of thrones&mdash;and the glory of Kings in all ages.

which we tread with their blood; they were faithful &s;ervants to the King of Kings, and ever loval &s;ubjects to their earthly &s;overeign. They al&s;o had the promi&s;e of a King, for him&s;elf and Succe&s;&s;ors, that they and theirs &s;hould enjoy all the liberties and immunities of natural-born &s;ub|jects within the Realm of England. Encouraged by &s;uch a promi&s;e, which they looked upon as &s;acred, they were ever ready, to the utmo&s;t of their ability, yea, and often beyond it, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the crown; never thinking their lives dear, when they could &s;erve their King and country, even with the lo&s;s of them.

<P>IT was a good remark, worthy the con&s;ideration of every man who loves his God, his King, or his country, that a late author makes. <Q>The people of both countries are united in the King, who is the head of the empire, the only coment of poli|tical bodies, to pre&s;erve <HI>union</HI> between the mem|bers of the empire, and between them and their political head.</Q> So then it is plain, that head and member, king and people are but one body, and are to be con&s;idered as &s;uch; if &s;o, then one part of the&s;e members have as ju&s;t a right, power and authority as the other, for all unites in <HI>one.</HI> And this the Briti&s;h parliament were &s;en&s;ible of, even in the charter granted to this Province, they therefore de&s;ired their american brethren &s;o many years back, not to make any law repugnant to the laws of En|gland.

<P>THEREFORE, Sir, With &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive reverence I humbly think that the argument brought to prove, that becau&s;e our predece&s;&s;ors &s;ubmitted to acts, or the power of parliament for &s;o long a time, that we ought to &s;ubmit likewi&s;e fails,&mdash;finally fails&mdash;for who has made the repugnant laws? Who is the cau&s;e of all this contention? Let England make no laws repugnant to the laws and rights of America, and all things will be mutually happy.</P>
<P>YOUR Excellency's other arguments taken from Feudal right &amp;c. &amp;c. is very tedious and
<PB N="7" REF="013014_0048_0F8FB0530EA7F018">
prolix, and I humbly conceive far from being con|clu&s;ive: For the pre&s;ent di&s;pute is not, whether the King of England has a Feudal right to the lands of America&mdash;but whether the Americans have a right to make their own laws, di&s;po&s;e of their own property, pay their own Governor and Judges, en|joy their own immunities as granted by charter to them, "as free and natural &s;ubjects, to all intents, con&s;tructions, and purpo&s;es, without the controul of any &s;upreme authority, of any government over them." If their right is good, they only a&s;k their own inheritance. But &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould appear clear by tho&s;e who are more adept in law phra&s;es, that the King has a Feudal right to the lands of America; I think the argument taken therefrom would revert much in favour of the American &s;ubjects, but what right a few people who fled from En|gli&s;h tyranny, who re&s;ided in Holland, and came as &s;trangers to the wiles of America, to &s;eek <HI>peace and liberty,</HI> amid&s;t the tribes of cruel &s;avages, can give any parliament on earth authority or power to rule over them, I cannot &s;ee; they appear to me from the foundation of &s;ettling America, to have a double right to be <HI>perfectly free,</HI> not only a right by the law of GOD, but a far greater right, than Engli&s;hmen have to their liberties, ina&s;much as the Americans obtained them at a dearer rate; they fought, they bled, they died purely for <HI>Liberty,</HI> and &s;hall not their children be free?</P>

<P>IT is no wonder then to &s;ee the Gentlemen of Bo&s;ton &s;o zealous for liberty, who &s;aw the guiltle&s;s victims of arbitrary authority expire before their eyes&mdash;no wonder their fire of liberty was kindled, to &s;tand their ground, to maintain the &s;pot their forefathers had bought, to command unarm'd their Governor to bani&s;h the bloody band of &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>NO wonder &s;uch men as the&s;e unite as a <HI>band of brethren</HI> to &s;tand up for, and take every prudent mea&s;ure to maintain tho&s;e liberties free from all infringments, that they have a natural and indubi|table right unto, and their happine&s;s is intere&s;ted therein.</P>
<P>GENERALLY the unhappine&s;s of Kings, Governors, and mini&s;ters originally ari&s;es from a <HI>tyrannical thought,</HI> that the people are made for them, and not they for the people; let mini|&s;ters con&s;ider them&s;elves not the churches lords, but the churches &s;ervants, and only direct the peo|ple by the laws of GOD and they would be happy.

Was Paul's GOD, or the chri&s;ti|an's GOD, in Paul's days&mdash;do you think that this was the GOD of love mentioned, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 16. They tell us indeed that GOD was love to Adam, before he fell, but when he fell he hated him and all mankind in him. But that Je&s;us Chri&s;t interceeded for them, and turn'd the wrath of the al|mighty into love, upon conditions of their repenting and being good, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t died to purcha&s;e the&s;e conditions; nay, the holy &s;pirit, and Heaven for them, if they will, but by prayer, and tears, live up to the terms of the Go&s;pel, (as they call it.)
