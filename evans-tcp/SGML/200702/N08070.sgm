<HEAD>Some Rea&s;ons, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>CONSIDERING the different Opinions a|mong the People of the Colony of <HI>Con|necticut,</HI> relative to the Conduct of the GO|VERNOR in taking, and of the COUNCILLORS in admini&s;tring the Oath enjoined by the Act of Parlia|ment, charging certain Stamp-Duties on the Colonies and Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> commonly called the Stamp-Act. And that &s;uch differing Sentiments, occa&s;ion Di&s;putes, Di&s;quietudes and Unea&s;ine&s;s among &s;ome of the Inha|bitants.</P>
<P>It may be expedient, and expected, that a brief Ac|count of the Rea&s;ons of that Conduct &s;hould be publi&s;h|ed, for the Information and Satisfaction of &s;uch as are de&s;irous to be acquainted with the &s;ame.</P>
<P>To the End therefore, that Truth may appear, in re|gard to that Matter; and that the Occa&s;ions of Unea&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="010297_0003_0F7E71FDE420D720">
concerning that Affair, may be removed. The fol|lowing Ob&s;ervations and Hints are offered to candid Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>It is well known to the People of this Colony, who have printed Copies of the Stamp-Act in their Hands; that all the then pre&s;ent Governors or Commanders in Chief of any Briti&s;h Colony, were expre&s;sly required be|fore the fir&s;t Day of November, 1765; and all who &s;hall hereafter be made Governors or Commanders in Chief of the Colonies and Plantations, or any of them before their Entrance into their Governments, to take a &s;olemn Oath, to do their utmo&s;t, that all, and every the Clau&s;es con|tained in that Act, &s;hould be punctually, and <HI>bona fide,</HI> ob&s;erved according to the true Intent and Meaning thereof, &s;o far as appertains unto the &s;aid Governors or Commanders in Chief re&s;pectively, under the like Pe|nalties, Forfeitures and Di&s;abilities, either for neglect|ing to take the &s;aid Oath, or for wittingly neglecting to do their Duty accordingly, as are mentioned and ex|pre&s;&s;ed in An Act made in the 7th and 8th Year of the Reign of King WILLIAM the Third, entituled, "An Act for preventing Frauds, and regulating Abu&s;es in the Plantation Trade." And that the Per&s;ons who have been, or &s;hall be appointed to admini&s;ter the Oath required to be taken by the &s;aid Act of King WILLIAM, are expre&s;&s;ly required to admini&s;ter the Oath required by the Stamp Act.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="010297_0004_0F7E71FEA2769DD8">
The Act of WILLIAM the Third, to which the Stamp Act refers, requires the &s;aid Governors or Commanders in Chief, to take the like Oath re&s;pecting the Clau&s;es in that Act; and al&s;o, re&s;pecting the Clau&s;es in An Act made in the 12^t^h Year of CHARLES the Second; and in another Act made in the 15^t^h Year of the &s;ame Reign: And that &s;uch Oath &s;hould be admini&s;tred by &s;uch Per|&s;ons as His Maje&s;ty, His Heirs or Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hould appoint; And by the afore&s;aid Act of WILLIAM, it is further enacted, that upon Complaint and Proof, be|fore His Maje&s;ty, His Heirs or Succe&s;&s;ors, or &s;uch as &s;hould be by him or them thereunto authori&s;ed and ap|pointed, by the Oath of two or more credible Witne&s;&s;es; that any of the &s;aid Governors or Commanders in Chief, have neglected to take the &s;aid Oath at the Times a|fore&s;aid, or have been wittingly or willingly negllgent in doing their Duty accordingly. The &s;aid Governor &s;o neglecting or offending, &s;hall be removed from his Government, and forfeit the Sum of One Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>And although it doth not appear, that any Per&s;ons were appointed in Con&s;equence of the Acts of the 12^t^h and 15^t^h of CHARLES the Second, to admini&s;ter the Oaths to the Governors, required to be taken by tho&s;e Acts (in both of which the Governors were required to be &s;worn, much to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, as in the Act of
<PB N="6" REF="010297_0005_0F7E71FF252D3640">
WILLIAM is mentioned) yet in Pur&s;uance of the Act of WILLIAM, the King appointed the Governor of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> to admini&s;ter that Oath to the Governor of <HI>Connecticut;</HI> upon which the Colony repre&s;ented to the King, the Hard&s;hips and Difficulties of &s;uch a Mea&s;ure, which obliged the Governor to go to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> to be qualified, before he could act in his Office with Safety. Upon which the King was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed by His Commi&s;&s;ion to a certain Number of the Coun|cil by Name, &amp;c. Which he calls his Council for the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> to appoint them, or any Three or more of them to admini&s;ter the Oath to the Governor; and that Commi&s;&s;ion &s;tands now directed to, and appoint|ing any Three or more of the Council of the Colony, for the Time being, to admini&s;ter that Oath to the Governor; (none el&s;e therefore, may do it) and the&s;e Per&s;ons, the Stamp Act expre&s;sly required to admini&s;ter the Oath, required by that Act, to be taken by the Governor.</P>
<P>By Virtue of that Commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal, lodged in the Secretary's Office, that Oath hath been admini&s;tred to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Governors of the Colony ever &s;ince; which is near Seventy Years.</P>
<P>The&s;e being the principal Facts, it may from thence be ju&s;tly ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. That as the Commi&s;&s;ion of King WILLIAM, to the Council of the Colony, was obtained on the Re|que&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="010297_0006_0F7E71FFEEB1F6D8">
que&s;t of the Colony; there can be no Doubt, but the Colony e&s;teemed it a great Favour, and thankfully ac|cepted it. And that &s;uch Reque&s;t and Acceptance mu&s;t imply on the Colony's Part, an Agreement to comform to it; and al&s;o, that the Council whom the People &s;hould elect for the King &s;hould act under and according to it. And this every Councillor by the Acceptance of his Office engages to do: And as it is a Maxim of Law in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, That the King hath an In|tere&s;t in, and a Right to the Service of all his Subjects; and more e&s;pecially to the Service of Tho&s;e who are the Officers of the Crown; and by that Means are un|der particular and expre&s;s Obligations to Obedience.</P>
<P>Every Governor and Councillor are bound, not only by their Allegience, but by their Office, and in the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e al&s;o, by Agreement or Contract, by accepting their Offices to which the afore&s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion is an|nexed, to yield Obedience to the Requirements of the King and Parliament.</P>
<P>It is taken for granted by the King and Parliament, That all his Maje&s;ty's Officers will obey their Com|mands. And on this Pre&s;umption, the Execution of Royal Commands, Acts of Parliament, and even Acts of Provincial Legi&s;latures are often made dependant. The King therefore, in every &s;uch Ca&s;e, expects all his Officers, as well tho&s;e which the People elect&punc; and
<PB N="8" REF="010297_0007_0F7E7200BA104DB8">
di&s;|ignate for him, as tho&s;e whom he, by his immediate Commi&s;&s;ion or Warrant appoints, will obey his Com|mands.</P>
<P>In Ca&s;e any Officers, who are immediately appointed by the Crown, refu&s;e Obedience; it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e they will be di&s;placed, and others more loyal and obedi|ent put in their Room. But the Government to which they belong, or for which they are appointed will be in no Danger of a Cen&s;ure in that Ca&s;e. It mu&s;t neverthele&s;s, be &s;uppo&s;ed, the Con&s;equence would be very different, if tho&s;e Officers whom the People elect, &s;hould refu&s;e &s;uch Obedience, and &s;o fru&s;trate the Intention and Requirements of the Act, in any particular; for, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, it may ju&s;tly be expected, the King will at lea&s;t appoint others, and that in another Government, in whom he can confide, and not continue the Honor of a Betru&s;tment to &s;uch, for the Time being, as the People &s;hould de&s;ignate, on whom he can have no Dependence. Yea, it is to be pre&s;umed, that if the Governor and Council, whom the People choo&s;e, &s;hould refu&s;e Obedience, the King, or the King and Parliament would deprive the People of the Privilege of electing &s;uch Officers; and then the whole Charter would be at once &s;truck up. That this would be the Event, in &s;uch Ca&s;e, mu&s;t be more than probable.</P>
<P>The Governor and the Councillors, apprehending their
<PB N="9" REF="010297_0008_0F7E7201CCC7A6F8">
Non-Compliance with the Stamp-Act, in the Particular afore&s;aid, would be fatal to the Charter Privileges grant|ed to the good People of this Colony (for which they have the tendere&s;t Regard, and highe&s;t Value) held them&s;elves bound to conduct &s;o as not to endanger, but rather, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ave them to them&s;elves, and the People, for who&s;e Welfare they were &s;eriou&s;ly concerned.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis not ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, that many entertain very mi&s;taken Apprehen&s;ions concerning the Part the Governor is bound to act by Virtue of the Oath he hath taken; they &s;uppo&s;e he is obliged to exert his power, as Governor, to enforce &s;aid Act upon the People, either by taking upon him&s;elf the Office of Stamp-Di&s;tributor, or appoint|ing &s;ome other to that Office, or the like. When in Truth no &s;uch Thing is expected or required&mdash;the Oath now taken, is not different from that which all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Governors have taken ever &s;ince the Act of Trade took Place; but that never made them Judges of Admiralty, Surveyors of the Woods, &amp;c. or empowered them to ap|point any. All that any former Governors were obliged to do, with Relation to the Act of Trade, or that the pre&s;ent Governors have to do with Regard to the Stamp-Act, is only to afford due Protection to the King's Officers; and, on proper Information, to prevent and pu|ni&s;h Frauds and Impo&s;itions. The Governor &s;wears, <Q>That he will do his utmo&s;t, that all, and every the Clau&s;es contained in &s;aid Act, be punctually and <HI>Bona fide</HI> ob&s;erved, according to the true Intent and Meaning thereof, &s;o far as appertains to him, as Governor.</Q> But here a Que&s;tion naturally ari&s;es, What additional Duty is incum|bent on the Governor, in Con&s;equence of his having taken this Oath? Indeed, little or nothing more than was his Duty before, and to which he was bound, by his Office-Oath, and the Rules of the Common Law. And the Oath required the Stamp-Act, is only to be con&s;idered as a further Security on the Governor, to di&s;charge that which he was be|fore bound to perform.</NOTE></P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e both the Go|vernor and Councillors, by a Refu&s;al, would have expo&s;ed
<PB N="10" REF="010297_0009_0F7E72023A5E98B0">
them&s;elves to the King's highe&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure; and what that means many have been made &s;en&s;ible of by fatal Ex|perience. There can be no Objections again&s;t &s;uch a Com|pliance with the expre&s;s Requirements of the Stamp-Act, unle&s;s they ari&s;e from the Force of &s;ome &s;uperior Law, or from the Force of &s;ome prior Oath which &s;uch Officers are under: To this it will readily be conceded, that Oath ought not to be again&s;t Oath, nor ought a &s;uperior Law to be di&s;obeyed by a Compliance with one &s;ubordinate to it; but if neither of the&s;e happen in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, the Objection vani&s;hes: And if on the Contrary, former Oaths, and a &s;uperior Law al&s;o, oblige to this Conduct, the Objection will appear yet more Groundle&s;s. That this is truly the Ca&s;e, will appear, if it be con&s;idered,</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Governor and Council were, by their Office-Oath, bound to &s;uch a Conformity to the Act.&mdash;It is well known to every one who hath in&s;pected the Governor's and A&s;&s;i&s;tant's Oaths, in the Colony-Law-Book, that they are &s;worn to maintain all the lawful Privileges of the Colony, &amp;c. By which they are bound to do their utmo&s;t for that Purpo&s;e: And the &s;ame Obli|gation lies upon them, not to neglect or refu&s;e doing that, the Omi&s;&s;ion of which would endanger the Lo&s;s of tho&s;e Privileges. This mu&s;t appear plain to every candid Rea|der
<PB N="11" REF="010297_0010_0F7E72031D110A40">
If therefore, the Governor and Council, whom the People choo&s;e, by their refu&s;ing Obedience to the Com|mands of an Act of Parliament, would endanger the Lo&s;s of the Privileges which they, and their Electors en|joy, as has been &s;hewn to be the Ca&s;e; it nece&s;&s;arily fol|lows, they are bound by their &s;aid Oaths, not to refu&s;e &s;uch Obedience; and al&s;o, that while they view Matters in this Light their Di&s;obedience, or Non-Compliance, could not, in their Opinion, come &s;hort of a Breach of their Office-Oaths. This &s;hews the greate&s;t Inju&s;tice, of being charged with Perjury, on Account of a Fulfilment of tho&s;e &s;acred Obligations comprehended in the Office-Oaths afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Let it be con&s;idered, Thirdly, That the Governor, by a refu&s;al to take the Oath, by the Time pre&s;cribed in the Act, would have expo&s;ed him&s;elf, be&s;ides what has been before mentioned, to the Penalty of being removed from his Government, and the Forfeiture of One Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling. And as his Tryal mu&s;t be before the King, or &s;uch Per&s;ons as he &s;hould appoint, there could be no avoiding a Condemnation, it would be to no Pur|po&s;e, unle&s;s to aggrevate the Offence, to plead any Thing again&s;t the Operation of the Act, before tho&s;e Judges.&mdash;A Judgment, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, would not only &s;ubject the Governor to the Payment of a large Fine, too heavy for
<PB N="12" REF="010297_0011_0F7E72039DEB7068">
a Governor of this Colony to bear; and to a Removal from his Office, but would al&s;o render him Infamous, and deprive him of any further U&s;efulne&s;s in Life: And how that would feel, let any Man, who has any Value for his Character and Reputation, make it his own Ca&s;e, and thereon candidly judge for him&s;elf, and in &s;o doing, he will judge for another.</P>
<P>It hath been objected, That although the Governor is &s;ubject, by the Act of Parliament, to a very &s;evere Penalty in Ca&s;e of his Neglect or Refu&s;al to take the Oath, yet no Penalty is impo&s;ed on the Council, in Ca&s;e they neglect or refu&s;e to admini&s;ter the &s;ame:&mdash;And though it might be wi&s;e and prudent, for the Governor to offer to take the Oath, and in a Sen&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for him &s;o to do; yet &s;urely the Council were under no &s;uch Obligation or Ne|ce&s;&s;ity to admini&s;ter the &s;ame:&mdash;And that, whatever might be &s;aid, by Way of Excu&s;e, on Account of the Governor, nothing can be &s;aid, in Favour of the Councillors, who undertook to admini&s;ter the &s;ame, as their Neglect or Refu&s;al expo&s;ed them to no Penalty at all.&mdash;</P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wered, That, although no parti|cular Penalty is expre&s;sly mentioned, in &s;aid Statute, to be inflicted on the Council, in ca&s;e they &s;hould refu&s;e or ne|glect
<PB N="13" REF="010297_0012_0F7E72056C298EA8">
to admini&s;ter the Oath required; yet, as the Com|mi&s;&s;ion expre&s;sly empowers and directs them to admini&s;ter the &s;ame, their Neglect, or Di&s;obedience would have been a great Breach of Tru&s;t, and &s;uch a high Contempt of the Authority both of the King and Parliament, as would be puni&s;hable even at Common Law. Is it not a known Rule of the Law, in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, where no particular Pe|nalty is expre&s;sly mentioned, that the Offender lies at the King's Mercy, and may be puni&s;hed at Di&s;cretion (&s;aving Life) either by the Courts of Common Law, or the Court of Chauncery? And 'tis apprehended, that the lea&s;t &s;uch Councillors could expect, would be to &s;uffer the &s;ame Pains and Penalties that the Governor would have incurred, had he been the faulty Party, and refu&s;ed to take the Oath. Let the impartial World candidly con&s;ider this, and &s;ay, Is it rea&s;onable the Councillors &s;hould expo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;uch a Sentence as this? If, as the Objection &s;uppo&s;es, the Penalty is too great for a Governor of this Colony bear, &s;urely, with more Rea&s;on it may be &s;aid, that 'tis much too heavy for any Councillors to endure!</P>
<P>This Matter, and the Con&s;equences, as they re|&s;pected the Governor, appeared &s;o clear to the Council, when di&s;cour&s;ed among them&s;elves, that the whole Council pre&s;ent, were of Opinion, it was advi&s;eable for the Governor to offer to take the Oath required:
<PB N="14" REF="010297_0013_0F7E7205E2581570">
They al&s;o &s;ee, that if one Governor was removed for Refu&s;al, another would be in the &s;ame Ca&s;e, and &s;o on. Therefore the Colony mu&s;t, in that Ca&s;e, give up all Pretence of having a Governor or Commander in Chief, unle&s;s he complied with the Act. And whether the Charter it&s;elf could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without &s;uch an Officer, is no difficult Que&s;tion to determine. If, therefore, it was the Governor's Duty to offer to take the Oath, it mu&s;t certainly be right for him to take it, in Ca&s;e the Council would admini&s;ter it: And that they were bound to admi|ni&s;ter it, has been clearly evinced: So that the Whole of their Conduct, in the Matter afore&s;aid, appears not only to be barely ju&s;tified; but al&s;o, that it de&s;erves the Applau&s;e of all who de&s;ire the Safety of the Privileges of the Colony. Whoever candidly con&s;ider the&s;e Things, will, as it is conceived, judge the Governor and Coun|cillors, by their afore&s;aid Conduct, acted the Part of faith|ful Officers to the Crown, and that of true Patriots to their Country. Upon the Whole then, it may be ju&s;tly concluded, they were moved from Principles of Loyalty to the King; from a &s;erious and tender Concern for the Privileges of the Colony; a con&s;cientious Regard to the &s;olemn Obligations of their Office-Oaths; and a ju&s;t Value for their own Intere&s;t, Reputation, and U&s;eful|ne&s;s in Life.</P>
