<HEAD>THE PRINCE of BRITTANY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1442, when the feudal &s;y&s;tem was prevalent in Europe, died John VI. Duke of Brittany. By his con&s;ort Joan, &s;i&s;ter of Charles VII, King of France, he left three &s;ons; Fran|cis, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; Peter, Count of Guingcamp; and Giles Lord of Chantoc&eacute;, whom, in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, we &s;hall call the Prince of Brittany. Their paternal uncle was the Con&s;ta|ble Arthur, Count of Richmond; an illu&s;trious Nobleman, who could triumph at once over the Engli&s;h, the mo&s;t formidable enemies of France, and over the courtiers of Charles; a conque&s;t this la&s;t, which co&s;t him, perhaps, greater efforts than the former.&mdash;Arthur had ju&s;t quitted his beautiful retreat, at the Ca&s;tle of Parthenay, with his new con&s;ort, Catharine of Luxenburgh, in order to be pre&s;ent at the approaching nupti|als of the Duke, his nephew.</P>
<P>Before we proceed further in this hi&s;tory, it will be proper to give &s;ome idea of the three Princes

of Brittany.&mdash;Francis, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions he&s;poke a weakne&s;s and effeminacy of &s;oul, was under the ab&s;olute guidance of his favourite, who, accord|ing to cu&s;tom, gave an ill direction to his very be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions. From this defect in his charac|ter proceeded, in the &s;equel, that atrocious mi&s;|conduct, which has forever ob&s;cured the lu&s;tre of all the good qualities he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Peter was not di&s;tingui&s;hed by a more manly under&s;tanding than his elder brother, A gloomy and petulant temper was rendered more di&s;gu&s;t|ing &s;till by a devotion tinctured with all the &s;u|per&s;tition of the times. Extremes of every kind, even the extremes of virtue, are to be avoided. Peter, although united to a mo&s;t beautiful Prin|ce&s;s, lived in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute celibacy; and, towards the end of his life, &s;ubmitted to all the au&s;terities of the mo&s;t rigid retirement.</P>
<P>The Prince of Brittany&punc; on the contrary, was endued with an independent &s;oul, which di&s;dain|ed every appearance of ob&s;truction. At the &s;lighte&s;t impul&s;e of inclination he was in&s;tantly decided. Wi&s;hes the mo&s;t trifling in reality were ruling pa&s;&s;ions with this ungovernable mind. In|attentive to con&s;equences, he would regard the pre&s;ent object only, &s;eize it with tran&s;port, and to the acqui&s;ition of it &s;acrifice every con&s;idera|tion of the future. Even his genero&s;ity was cha|racterized by this exce&s;&s;ive violence.&mdash;He &s;corned tho&s;e political ob&s;ervances &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to all men, and e&s;pecially to per&s;ons of his exalt|ed rank. Equally incapable of concealment and

re&s;traint, ever yielding to the fir&s;t &s;allies of his impetuous temper, he was hurried from impru|dence to imprudence, and from misfortune to misfortune; thus exhibiting to all the great ne|ce&s;&s;ity of endeavoring to acquire the habits of moderation and &s;elf-command. This indi&s;creet precipitancy of conduct, this dangerous vice (for we can hardly give it another name) rendered even his virtues u&s;ele&s;s and unproductive; vir|tues, that have only in&s;pired a too late and un|availing pity, the poor recompen&s;e of injured in|nocence&middot;</P>
<P>Francis was impatient to be inve&s;ted with the ducal mantle, and, as his fir&s;t con&s;ort was dead, to form a new alliance, that might flatter his am|bitious views. A daughter of James I, King of Scotland, in giving him her hand, added claims to her dowry, which &s;ome future contingencies might realize; it being &s;ettled, that if her father &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue male, I&s;abella &s;hould &s;ucceed to the throne, and &s;hare it with her hu&s;|band.</P>
<P>The double ceremony of the marriage and co|ronation of Francis had brought to his Court the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of the French Nobility. The magnificent entertainments, given on this occa|&s;ion, were &s;carcely terminated, when the Prince of Brittany reque&s;ted a private audience of the Duke:&mdash;"My brother," &s;aid he "it is impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train my impatience. You have now attain|ed

the &s;ummit of felicity. You po&s;&s;e&s;s the lovely wife who was once de&s;tined for me; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John VI, his two elde&s;t &s;ons being married, had de|manded this Prince&s;s for his younge&s;t; but the King of Scotland had then declined an alliances with this family.</NOTE> and one day, perhaps, I may &s;ee you on the throne of Scotland. My lot is yet uncertain; but it is in your power to render it completely happy. I love the mo&s;t adorable of women. I &s;hall become a prey to grief, if I delay any longer to lead the charming Alicia to the altar. Forgive me; my pa&s;&s;ion has hitherto been a &s;ecret to you. Unavoidable circum&s;tances have obliged me to conceal it. Her parents, bound by &s;ome indi&s;|creet promi&s;e, extorted from them in a moment of weakne&s;s, have been aver&s;e to this union. They are no more; and with them every ob&s;tacle has vani&s;hed. The family of Dinan, you are &s;en&s;ible, may a&s;pire to an alliance with Sove|reigns. Nothing is wanting but your approba|tion. As your liege &s;ubject, I humbly &s;olicit your favor: as your brother, I entreat it with all that ardour of affection which we owe to each o|ther. By either title. I hope to gain your con|&s;ent. My happine&s;s, my life it&s;elf is at &s;take. Let my nuptials now &s;peedily follow yours."</P>
<P>Francis a&s;&s;ures his brother that he would exert all his authority in his favor. He embraces him with faternal tenderne&s;s, and is as warmly inter|e&s;ted in his happine&s;s as in his own. The enrap|tured Prince already imagines him&s;elf the hu&s;band of Alicia.&mdash;He ha&s;tens to throw him&s;elf at her

feet: "No expre&s;&s;ions," &s;aid he, "can de&s;|cribe my joy. The Duke is informed of all. He knows, divine Alicia, he knows that I ido|lize you&mdash;that I am impatient to be yours. Ah! let the Duke reign over Brittany; let him allot me &s;till no more than the paltry e&s;tabli&s;hment I enjoy, unworthy as it is of my birth and right|ful claims: I will never more complain. Have I not obtained the &s;upreme felicity of my life? O my adorable mi&s;tre&s;s, am not I &s;uperior to my brother&mdash;to the greate&s;t Monarch in the world? Ah! &s;peak it, repeat a thou&s;and times, that the Prince of Brittany fir&s;t in&s;pired you with &s;en&s;ibil|ity. Can Virtue forbid the dear confe&s;&s;ion?"</P>
<P>He ki&s;&s;ed one of her hands with tran&s;port. In the exce&s;s of emotion tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ive tears e&s;caped him, which have &s;uch a powerful empire over a young and tender heart.&mdash;"Prince," an&s;wered Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan, "what do you wi&s;h&mdash; what can you require? Yes! I do not he&s;itate to &s;ay, it is you that have taught me I have a &s;oul, alas, but too &s;u&s;ceptible. But do you forget that my parents &s;till live in an uncle, who inherits their power over me? Has not the Mar&s;hal of Brittany an unconquerable aver&s;ion to you? Does he not compel me to endure the court&s;hip, or ra|ther the per&s;ecution, of Arthur de Montauban? My cruel guardian exacts implicit obedience.&mdash; He urges the &s;olemn engagement of my parents in favor of my per&s;ecutor. It is my duty, he &s;ays, to fulfil that promi&s;e&mdash;live&mdash;you &s;hall be mine," eagerly re&s;umed the Prince, "no power on earth &s;hall prevent our union. I adore you:
<PB N="8" REF="034417_0008_0FFD9742B8436D58">
your parents are no more: you are free: you are mine: I have my brother's con&s;ent: I have yours. Will the pre&s;umptuous Arthur &s;till con|tend with the brother of his Sovereign? But, my &s;uperior rank out of the que&s;tion, who can boa&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion that can vie with mine?&mdash;Oh, my divine mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;catter tho&s;e clouds: let us have no other pro&s;pect but the altar. Every thing be|&s;peaks our approaching happine&s;s&mdash;all is propiti|ous to an union which Heaven has already form|ed."</P>
<P>Such was the ardor, &s;uch was the impetuo&s;ity with which the Prince of Brittany loved and &s;poke. He could divine no ob&s;truction to his views. His happine&s;s, as it was exqui&s;ite in idea, was no le&s;s certain in expectation. He ran to communi|cate his tran&s;ports in his friend Tanguy, the Ba&s;tard of Brittany; while the charming Alicia &s;till refu&s;ed to harbour the flattering illu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Her apprehen&s;ions, indeed, were not without foundation. The Prince was &s;urrounded at court by implacable enemies, who were &s;ecretly con|triving his ruin, and who were actuated by every motive of revenge. Arthur de Montauban, hur|ried on by the efferve&s;cence of a pa&s;&s;ion, that heeded not the &s;anctity of laws, was impatient to be rid of a formidable rival. John de Hingant, Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber, did not fo&s;ter a le&s;s devouring flame; he had received &s;ome af|front from the Prince of Brittany; and offended Vanity is actuated by all the rage of jealous Love. With the&s;e two per&s;ons was a&s;&s;ociated

James d'E&s;pinay, Bi&s;hop of Rennes. They di|rected, at plea&s;ure, the weak under&s;tanding of the Duke; and, being informed of the conver|&s;ation which he had ju&s;t had with his brother, they erected their batteries, in order to combat and de&s;troy, if po&s;&s;ible, the object of their hatred.</P>
<P>Tanguy was not more &s;anguine than Alicia. He was not flattered by the illu&s;ions of an ima|gination which Love had led a&s;tray.&mdash;"My brother," &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Prince, "if the laws have forbidden me to pro|nonce a name &s;o dear, more indulgent Nature will permit it.&mdash;Yes, the mo&s;t affectionate of brothers, the mo&s;t zealous for your intere&s;t, &s;peaks to you now, Will you never open your eyes to the repre&s;entations of truth?

How can you hope that Bertrand de Dinan will con&s;ent to give you his niece, when he makes it a point of honor to fulfil the engagement of her parents&mdash;an engagement which they renewed in their dying moments&mdash; when Arthur de Montauban, in &s;hort, is named the happy"&mdash;"Proceed not, cruel man," inter|rupted the Prince; "Arthur do&s;t thou &s;ay!&mdash; Arthur the hu&s;band of Alicia!&mdash;Alicia in the arms of another&mdash;Dreadful idea!&mdash;Thou know|e&s;t me not&mdash;thou knowe&s;t&mdash;let me not be compel|led to it&mdash;I will not call the Engli&s;h to my aid&mdash; Brittany &s;hall fir&s;t &s;wim in blood&mdash;her towns &s;hall he laid in a&s;hes&mdash;Oh, my dear Tanguy, &s;ince the name of brother affects thee, I conjure the by the tender ties that unite us, not to wound Alicia?

of my brother. Once more Tanguy, do not deform with clouds the charming pro&s;pect before me. Thou delighte&s;t, my brother to torment me&mdash;Think how much I &s;uffer"&mdash;"Ah! my brother I &s;uffer &s;till more than you. I contem|plate with grief the variety of woes that await you&mdash;You are &s;en&s;ible how much I love you. But I cannot conceal from you the depth of the aby&s;s into which you are ha&s;tening to plunge. You have enemies"&mdash;"I de&s;pi&s;e them"&mdash;"I &s;corn the arts of a courtier; and I wi&s;h they may be perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that my contempt for them is even greater than my dete&s;tation."&mdash;"You are a Prince, my Lord."&mdash;"I am the lover of Alicia, and all my wi&s;hes are to be the hu&s;band. My dear Tanguy, forgive my tran&s;ports. I am di&s;tracted when the lea&s;t ob&s;tacle is pre&s;ented to the mo&s;t ardent love. I have opened my whole &s;oul to you. But I am very far from having re|cour&s;e to a vengeance which I my&s;elf abhor. So far from being in&s;tramental in bringing the cala|mities of war on my Prince and country, as I have ra&s;hly &s;aid, they &s;hall never find a more zea|lous defender than your brother. You talk of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;have I de&s;erved them? In one in&s;tance, indeed, I forgot my&s;elf: I affronted Hingant. But was not fault immediately followed by the ample confe&s;&s;ions? Ah? my friend, I bear a too &s;u&s;ceptible heart! Do not endeavor thus to deprive me at once of my hope&mdash;my life"&mdash;</P>
<P>The Prince could not utter this la&s;t affecting appeal to Friend&s;hip, without letting drop &s;ome natural tears; and Tanguy perceived, that
<PB N="11" REF="034417_0011_0FFD974B1FA0D128">
it was in vain to combat the fervors of &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion by expo&s;tulation, or to check the impetu|o&s;ity of &s;uch a temper, but by the language of &s;oothing tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor was the charming Alicia le&s;s an object of compa&s;&s;ion. Her irritated uncle, to whom her partiality for the Prince of Brittany was no &s;e|cret, overwhelmed her with reproaches. He in&s;i&s;ted with the haughty violence of authority, that &s;he &s;hould &s;acrifice the inclinations of her heart, by a pa&s;&s;ive compliance with the dying engagement of her parents. "<HI>Our</HI> hearts," &s;aid he, "know no other principle than Honor, no other law, no other pa&s;&s;ion. Love we leave to the vulgar, who are at liberty to follow their ca|pricious inclinations. In being exalted above the re&s;t of mankind, <HI>our</HI> duty is to combat, to &s;ubdue, to &s;acrifice our pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>Our</HI> prerog|ative is to mine an example to all around us. What are all the advantages of nobility, if we do not purcha&s;e them by the mo&s;t exalted virtues? Go to the altar with Arthur de Montauban&mdash; let me never &s;ee thee again but as his wife.&mdash; What would I &s;ay&mdash;I would rather &s;ee thee in thy grave than&mdash;but thou knowe&s;t thy duty&mdash; I expect ab&s;olute obedience."</P>
<P>In vain did Alicia pro&s;trate her&s;elf, all in tears, before the Mar&s;hal.&mdash;"Oh, my Lord! deign to hear me&mdash;you&mdash;you are now my father. You cannot doubt how much I loved my parents&mdash; how much I cheri&s;h and revere their memory. I am &s;till impre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful def|erence
<PB N="12" REF="034417_0012_0FFD974CBAE8E308">
to their commands. But could they di&s;|po&s;e of my hand without con&s;ulting this poor heart? Can my duty oblige me to render my&s;elf mi&s;erable for ever? Why did not the dear au|thors of my being remove me far from the pre&s;|ence of the Prince of Brittany? Why did they permit his vi&s;its&mdash;his conver&s;ations? His prince|ly rank has no charms with me. Oh, did you but know him&mdash;did you but read his heart like me&mdash;Oh, my uncle! let me rather die a hund|red times than &s;ub&s;cribe to this barbarous prom|i&s;e. At lea&s;t, let me be permitted, far from the court and the world, to bury my grief in &s;ome deep &s;olitude. There left wholly to my&s;elf&mdash;" "To your&s;elf!" re&s;umed the furious Mar&s;hal, as he retired; "you are not your own&mdash;you belong to your country, to your family, to honor.&mdash;They claim their victim, and they &s;hall have it."</P>
<P>The Duke &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to his brother, to de&s;ire him to repair to the palace. The Prince flew thither with an impatience, which be&s;poke a certainty, that the commencement of his happi|ne&s;s was approaching. "My brother," &s;aid the Duke, the moment he entered, "you know how much I have your happine&s;s at heart. The zealous affection of friend&s;hip would add, if po&s;|ible, to the powerful claims of Nature. But your brother, before he can li&s;ten to the&s;e claims; mu&s;t recollect that he is a &s;overeign. I have ob|ligations to my &s;ubjects&mdash;I have obligations to equity. I have &s;een the Mar&s;hal de Dinan&mdash;he is inflexible. Montauban has received his promi&s;e, and the &s;olemn promi&s;e of dying parents. In

&s;pite of me, in &s;pite of you, Montauban mu&s;t the hu&s;band of Alicia. You mu&s;t &s;ubdue your&s;e and imitate me."</P>
<P>The impetuous Prince clapped his hand to his &s;word. "I have no longer then," &s;aid he, "any &s;upport but this. It &s;hall cha&s;ti&s;e the in&s;o|lence of Arthur. Shall I yield Alicia to him? Cruel&mdash;you are not my brother&mdash;you are my ty|rant&mdash;my executioner!"&mdash;"Ah, my brother, my brother, I will forget the &s;overeign to whom the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are &s;o unbecoming. I pity your di&s;tre&s;s. I weep with you. Shed your tears in my bo&s;om. Lament the wretched fate, that has plunged you into a pa&s;&s;ion, which the Prince of Brittany mu&s;t ab&s;olutely &s;ubdue. We mu&s;t de|vote our&s;elves to our inferiors. So far from wi&s;h|ing to render the Mar&s;hal <HI>perjured,</HI> it is our duty&punc; my brother, to &s;upport, to guarantee his promi&s;e. Let ju&s;tice triumph, and leave the event to heav|en. I feel all the &s;everity of this refu&s;al. I &s;uff|er in <HI>your</HI> &s;ufferings. But place your&s;elf in my &s;ituation&mdash;be the &s;overeign&mdash;and dictate to me my duty. I appeal to your own deci&s;ion&mdash;I ap|peal to the Count of Richmond. I refer you to that wi&s;e and excellent friend. He loves you. He under&s;tands the laws of honor. I leave you to his advice, and to your own reflections."</P>
<P>The Prince of Brittany, di&s;tracted by the unex|pected refu&s;al of his brother, flies to throw him|&s;elf at the feet of Alicia. The &s;ervants of the Mar&s;hal in vain oppo&s;e his entrance. He finds
<PB N="14" REF="034417_0014_0FFD9752779AF858">
her alone, in her apartment, overwhelmed by the mo&s;t poignant grief. He pours forth all the tran&s;ports of a heart, di&s;tracted at the idea of lo&s;ing all that was dear to him in life. Alicia avows her pa&s;&s;ion for the Prince, with the beau|tiful ingeniou&s;ne&s;s of virtuous love. But &s;he urg|es the irre&s;i&s;tible ob&s;tacles to their union, in the dying engagement of her parents, and the obli|gations to her family and honor, which the Mar|&s;hal, her uncle, had been ju&s;t enforcing.&mdash;"Alas! Prince," &s;aid &s;he, "I mu&s;t give my hand to an|other; but my heart is &s;till&mdash;" "Go then, &s;aid the furious Prince; "let that heart in&s;tantly follow the pre&s;ent of the hand&mdash;I&mdash;I will &s;hew you what it is to love."&mdash;Then &s;eizing his &s;word, he was going to plunge it into his heart, not|with&s;tanding all the cries and efforts of the ter|rified Alicia, when, in that in&s;tant, he heard an unexpected voice:&mdash;"Stop, &s;top, I come to re|cal you to life."&mdash;The Prince beheld Tanguy.&mdash; "Ah! my brother," &s;aid he, "you love me&mdash; and would you wi&s;h me to live? Do you know the horrors that &s;urround me?"&mdash;"I know all; I know that the Mar&s;hal has &s;ecured the Duke in his intere&s;t. But the Con&s;table, your uncle, has &s;ent for you. He has had a long conver&s;ation with the Duke, and, I doubt not, was &s;ucce&s;sful." "My brother! Is it po&s;&s;ible? Shall Alicia yet be mine? And you, madam&mdash;you weep&mdash;divine mi&s;tre&s;s of my heart, forgive&mdash;forgive me if I have appeared to doubt your love." "Ah! Prince," &s;aid Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan, "how cruel have you been! But go&mdash;claim the protec|tion of the Court of Richmond. Let him gain
<PB N="15" REF="034417_0015_0FFD9754E1A2EA88">
the Duke&mdash;let him prevail upon my uncle&mdash;and you will &s;ee whether Alicia can love."</P>
<P>The Prince of Brittany ha&s;tened to the Con&s;ta|ble. The &s;ea&s;onable interference of Tanguy had re&s;tored him in &s;ome mea&s;ure from death to life; and he was now felicitating him&s;elf upon far different pro&s;pects. But the Con&s;table, who re|ceived him with all the expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s and e&s;teem, appeared, however, to entertain the &s;ame ideas with the Duke, of the ab&s;olute &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion due to parental authority, and of cer|tain indi&s;pen&s;able claims of family and honor. Sentiments, &s;o fatal to the plea&s;ing views which the Prince had once began to entertain, excited in his bo&s;om the &s;ame tran&s;ports of de&s;peration, which we have &s;een &s;o ea&s;ily kindled. "I adore Alicia," &s;aid he; "the mere idea of beholding her in the arms of another, drives me to di&s;trac|tion. If I &s;hould implore the King of En|gland&mdash;" "Prince, to the King of England I &s;end you. I have importuned the Duke to en|tru&s;t you with a negociation, equally important and honorable. I have offered to be re&s;pon&s;ible for you. The King of England loves you. Brought up in his court, you po&s;&s;e&s;s peculiar means of conciliating him.

pa&s;&s;ion, have ju&s;t threated to have recour&s;e to mea&s;ures of violence and guilt. Judge, from this, whether I e&s;teem you."&mdash;"Ah, my Lord," exclaimed the Prince, throwing him&s;elf into the arms of his uncle, and weeping with admiration, "you know me! Yes, I will &s;trive to merit this exce&s;s of genero&s;ity. The&s;e tears &s;peak how much I am affected by this exalted conduct. Yes, I will ju&s;tify your choice. I will employ every expedient to reconcile two nations that are our allies&mdash;to convince you that the Prince of Brittany, di&s;tracted by an unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion, is yet incapable of a di&s;honorable action. I ha&s;ten to execute my commi&s;&s;ion; and, after I have ful|filled my duty, I return to claim my reward. Remember, I conjure you, I can have no other than Alicia." "Hold, Prince: do not imagine that I purcha&s;e your fidelity by flattering your hopes. I e&s;teem you too well to apprehend any thing for your re&s;entment. No; I do not at|tempt to deceive you. I go &s;till farther; I de|clare that if your brother &s;hould have the weak|ne&s;s to con&s;ent to your wi&s;hes, I will be the fir&s;t to oppo&s;e them. You &s;ee that I &s;peak to you with a frankne&s;s, of which I am certain you will take no advantage. All that I can promi&s;e, and that honor will permit me to grant, with a view only to prepare you to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion incompatible with your duty, is to engage the Duke to po&s;tpone the marriage of Alicia till your return."</P>
<P>"What, my Lord&mdash;" "I have nothing more to &s;ay; I &s;hall wait you at the palace, that we may confer with you on your emba&s;&s;y."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="034417_0017_0FFD9758F608DAF0">The Duke, and the whole Council, greatly di&s;approved the choice of the mediator. They repre&s;ented to the Con&s;table, that to entru&s;t the Prince with a negociation of &s;uch a delicate na|ture, was to put arms in the hands of a madman, and to hazard the &s;afety of Brittany. They did not doubt that he would &s;olicit the King of En|gland to &s;upport him in his preten&s;ions, and to take part in his re&s;entment." "How little," an&s;wered Richmond, "do you under&s;tand man|kind! Nothing is &s;o flattering to human pride as a noble confidence. It nece&s;&s;arily in&s;pires &s;elf|e&s;teem; and whoever can e&s;teem him&s;elf, is ever cautious of de&s;cending to ignoble actions. Trea|&s;on is the height of turpitude. My nephew is violent and impetuous, but incapable of forget|ting his honor. I will an&s;wer for &s;ucce&s;s. The frankne&s;s of a &s;oldier is &s;ometimes a more certain re&s;ource than all the arts of a politician."</P>
<P>Francis confirmed to his brother the promi&s;e of their uncle, that the marriage of Alicia with Montaubon &s;hould be po&s;tponed till his re|turn, The Prince had made the nece&s;&s;ary prepa|rations for his departure; but it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to leave Brittany, without having &s;een Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan. He &s;hould have en|countered all hazards to procure with her a mo|ment's interview. But a variety of ob&s;tacles were to be overcome. Alicia, kept like a pri|&s;oner, at a ca&s;tle &s;ome leagues from the court, had only the liberty of deploring her hard fate
<PB N="18" REF="034417_0018_0FFD975C57AF81D0">
in &s;ecret. She waited for the fatal moment that was to &s;ubject her to an odious yoke. She would wander in an exten&s;ive park, which &s;eemed cal|culated to cheri&s;h that gloomy melancholy, which is almo&s;t in&s;eparable from an unfortunate love. Her languid &s;teps imperceptably led her to a lit|tle &s;olitary wood, into which the light of day could &s;carcely enter. It was divided by a tran&s;|parent brook, who&s;e gentle murmurs lulled the &s;oul to mu&s;ing; and, at &s;ome di&s;tance, was a &s;eat of turf. There did Alicia go, to ruminate as it were, on the &s;entiments that oppre&s;&s;ed her. The unfortunate, and lovers e&s;pecially, experience an exqui&s;ite &s;weetne&s;s of &s;en&s;ation, in indulging their tears, and cheri&s;hing their griefs; and what|ever can deepen their &s;orrows, they meet even with an eagerne&s;s of anticipation. For them has nature created "the haunts of meditation," tho&s;e &s;olitary glooms, tho&s;e torrents, tho&s;e grottos, tho&s;e romantic &s;cenes, that &s;peak not to the hap|py, but which addre&s;s with &s;uch energy the &s;ouls, who&s;e misfortunes exerci&s;e their &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan held in her hand a let|ter from the Prince, which &s;he repeatedly read, and bedewed with her tears. She &s;poke to it, as if it were capable of under&s;tanding and an&s;wering her affecting plaints. "Ah! too dangerous writ|ing," &s;aid &s;he, "why cannot I have the re&s;olu|tion to ca&s;t thee far from this impa&s;&s;ioned bo&s;om? Ah! what avails it thus to cheri&s;h a pa&s;&s;ion which it will &s;oon become criminal to avow? And could a flame &s;o pure be in&s;pired only to become crimi|nal? Sole object of my affections, alas! how little

is the unfortunate Alicia yet known to thee! Could&s;t thou ever imagine for a moment that my heart&mdash;thou art its only Lord. Thou wilt rule in it, I perceive too well, to my late&s;t &s;igh. I will repeat it to the Mar&s;hal, to Montaubon, to the Duke. No, Arthur&mdash;barbarous man! I never will pronounce the fatal vows. I will &s;wear, yes, I will &s;wear to love none but the Prince of Brittany; and I will die, I will be the victim of my haple&s;s love."&mdash;"You &s;hall live to receive my uncea&s;ing homage. I would die a hundred times for you, divide Alicia. Oh! how dear are the&s;e &s;entiments&mdash;the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions&mdash;how delicious to my &s;oul!"</P>
<P>Alicia is &s;tartled; but her terror is &s;oon di&s;&s;ipa|ted. She beholds at her feet the Prince of Britta|ny, who &s;eizes one of her hands, and, in the tran&s;ports of ec&s;tacy, covers it with his ki&s;&s;es and his tears.&mdash;"Is it you, Prince! you have heard me?"&mdash;"Do you reproach your&s;elf with having made me the happie&s;t of men? Are you appre|hen&s;ive that I &s;hall not merit a tenderne&s;s worthy of every &s;acrifice I can make? Be &s;atisfied with your&s;elf, dear mi&s;tre&s;s of a heart, that beats on|ly for the charming Alicia. My death is now po&s;t|poned: the Con&s;table has pa&s;&s;ed his word: thy nuptials with a dete&s;ted rival are deferred till my return, and then&mdash;thou never &s;halt be Arthur's. Promi&s;e me only to keep thy faith, thy heart, in|violate."&mdash;"Pre&s;erve my heart for you, Prince! Ah! is it for you to imagine I can ever give it to another? Can I take from you a &s;ingle moment
<PB N="20" REF="034417_0020_0FFD97605986F538">
of my life? Go&mdash;go well a&s;&s;ured that Alicia &mdash;Prince, you cannot too &s;oon return."</P>
<P>They renew the &s;olemn vow of everla&s;ting love, in &s;pite of every ob&s;truction. Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan takes one of her bracelets, interwoven with her hair, and pre&s;ents it to her lover, who &s;eizes it with rapture, and ki&s;&s;es it a thou&s;and times, puts it into his bo&s;om: "Never," &s;aid he, "&s;hall it leave my heart. It is the &s;eal of our engagement. Remember, divine Alicia, that I go far from you, a&s;&s;ured that all I adore will con|tinue faithful.&mdash;Let us retire, my friend," &s;aid he to Tanguy, who was waiting at &s;ome di&s;|tance; "I am now at the &s;ummit of felicity; I am beloved."</P>
<P>The two lovers are obliged to &s;eparate. The Prince had contrived to gain over one of the &s;er|vants of the Mar&s;hal, who had introduced him privately into the park. This man runs to ac|quaint him that the Lord of Dinan is coming. The Prince ha&s;tily retires, accompanied by Tan|guy, who undertakes during his ab&s;ence, to &s;end him intelligence of whatever related to his mi&s;|tre&s;s. The two friends, at length, embrace; they part; and the Prince of Brittany embarks for England.</P>
<P>The Prince of Brittany, as the Con&s;table had fore&s;een, met with the mo&s;t favorable reception from the King of England. He &s;ucceeded in eve|ry object of his emba&s;&s;y; and Henry, to evince his extreme &s;atisfaction in a mediator for whom
<PB N="21" REF="034417_0021_0FFD9763B1768960">
he had long entertained the greate&s;t per&s;onal re|gard, conferred upon him a pen&s;ion of 2000 no|bles.</P>
<P>Tanguy, in the mean time, corre&s;ponded con|&s;tantly with his friend. The charming Alicia, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, was the favorite object of his letters. But there was a &s;ubject le&s;s delightful, on which he found it nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to expatiate. He gave the Prince a minute account of the vari|ous artifices that were employed by his enemies, in order to ruin him in the e&s;timation of his bro|ther. But the Prince, attentive to nothing but what related to Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan, paid no regard to the machinations of Arthur and his fa|mily.</P>
<P>Montauban, &s;upported in his preten&s;ions by the Mar&s;hal, repaired one day to the apartmets of Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan. At a vi&s;it &s;o unex|pected &s;he could not conceal &s;ome &s;ymptoms of perturbation. "Ah! Madam," &s;aid he, "can this agitation, &s;o ill concealed, be propitious to my hopes?"&mdash;"Hold my lord; I will give you a convincing proof of confidence: I think you worthy of it. It is to a&s;&s;ure you that you may be certain of my e&s;teem, altho a tender &s;en|timent cannot.&mdash;"And what, Madam, can prevent you from rewarding with that tender &s;en|timent the ardent pa&s;&s;ion you have in&s;pired? I impatiently long for the happy ties."&mdash;"They are not yet formed, my lord. I would fain re|gard you as an object of e&s;teem, and as &s;uch, open my whole heart to you. I am incapable of

di&s;&s;imulation: I dread the inju&s;tice of deceiving you: I do not he&s;itate then to confe&s;s it to you. The Prince of Brittany only is"&mdash;"You have named the author of all my torments. My &s;u&s;|picions then are but too well founded. But you forget, Madam, that I have in my hand the &s;o|lemn promi&s;e of your parents and of your uncle; that I have the con&s;ent of your &s;overeign; that I have a right of your's. Yes, Madam, you mu&s;t be mine. Heaven has de&s;tined you to be my wife."&mdash;"Heaven, my lord! Heaven in&s;pires the inclinations; and for you I can only"&mdash; "Proceed, Madam," &s;aid Arthur, who&s;e cha|racter was not le&s;s impetuous than that of his ri|val, proceed; tell me that you dete&s;t me, that I am the mo&s;t odious of men&mdash;your enemy&mdash;your per&s;ecutor. Yes, I will be then the tyrant you dete&s;t. My &s;ole object now &s;hall be to ju&s;tify an aver&s;ion I have &s;o little de&s;erved. Never, never more will I &s;peak to you in the langauge of love. You &s;hall witne&s;s now the furious tran&s;ports of re|&s;entment. Your fate is decided. The Mar&s;hal and the Duke have ordered it. Ungrateful wo|man!

No, no; think not that I can entertain &s;uch &s;entiments. They never have approached&mdash;they never will approach my heart. From my mouth only have e&s;caped expre&s;&s;ions &s;o extraordinary to every &s;entiment of my &s;oul."&mdash;"It is u&s;ele&s;s, my lord, to repeat it: Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan was never formed to encourage a pa&s;&s;ion by illu&s;ive hopes. Load me

with reproaches; but you &s;hall never accu&s;e me of artifice and treachery. Be &s;upported by the con&s;ent of my uncle, and of my whole family: have recour&s;e too to the authority of your &s;ove|reign: di&s;po&s;e, like a tyrant, of my hand: my tears are all I can oppo&s;e to you; but my heart, that heart which you would tear, which you would de&s;troy&mdash;it never can be, it never &s;hall be your's. The Prince of Brittany&mdash;it &s;hall know no other lord, till death relea&s;e me from my woes. After this declaration, drag me to the altar.'&mdash; "Yes, I will drag you to the altar, a victim de|voted to my ju&s;t re&s;entment. Yes, I &s;hall know how to torture that heart which will not love&mdash; which my rival po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Henceforth will I li&s;|ten only to the dictates&mdash;to the &s;ugge&s;tions of vengeance."</P>
<P>Nor were the threats of Arthur ineffectual. The ruin of the Prince of Brittany was now pur|&s;ued with an inveteracy, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more determined. His enemies were even &s;o &s;uce&s;sful, as to excite in the brea&s;t of his brother, all the jealou&s;y and re&s;entment of &s;elf-love. This &s;enti|ment, which among all men is, perhaps, the mo&s;t predominant, when it actuates the conduct of a &s;overeign, is the dreadful &s;pring of the mo&s;t ex|travagant exce&s;&s;es. Francis was per&s;uaded to believe, that his brother had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf concerning him in very di&s;loyal terms, and that he only waited for an opportunity to excite a re|volt. Nor did they forget the friend&s;hip of the King of England, whom they repre&s;ented as a foe impatient to fall upon Brittany, on the fir&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="034417_0024_0FFD976AC9AB0578">
intimation from the Prince. In a word, the&s;e dete&s;table countries found means to &s;tifle the voice of nature, and to di&s;&s;olve its mo&s;t tender recol|lections. Weakne&s;s now a&s;&s;umed all the atroci|ou&s;ne&s;s of guilt; and every day &s;trengthened it in a character which was the &s;port of perfidy and malice.</P>
<P>The King of England continued to lavi&s;h upon the Prince a thou&s;and marks of unbound|ed friend&s;hip. One day he &s;urprized him mu|&s;ing in a melancholy attitude over a letter he had ju&s;t received. Henry, with the affectionate earne&s;tne&s;s of a friend, in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing the cau&s;e of a grief which was &s;o vi&s;ible in his countenance. The Prince, who could not re&s;i&s;t the generous in&s;tances of his augu&s;t friend, rela|ted the whole hi&s;tory of his pa&s;&s;ion for the beau|tiful Alicia, and the various ob&s;tacles to his hap|pine&s;s. The letter which he had ju&s;t received, informed him that Arthur and his parti&s;ans, were exerting all their influence to ha&s;ten the &s;olemni|zation of that marriage, which by an engage|ment, was not to take place till his return. It was added, that the Duke was on the point of yielding to their pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations, notwith|&s;tanding the Count of Richmond, who defended his ab&s;ent nephew, and urged the inviolable &s;anctity of a promi&s;e. Henry, who immediately entered into the re&s;entment of his friend, united perhaps &s;ome political views to tho&s;e of per&s;onal e&s;teem, in the offer which he made of &s;upport|ing his preten&s;ions by force of arms. "I am &s;en&s;ible," &s;aid the noble youth, "of the gene|rous
<PB N="25" REF="034417_0025_0FFD976E45160468">
warmth with which you conde&s;cend to enter into my concerns. Yes! I adore Alicia; and &s;he &s;hall be mine, or my rival and all his parti&s;ans, I my&s;elf &s;hall expire under a thou&s;and wounds. But, my lord, can I forget the glorious commi&s;|&s;ion with which I am honored? Can I, the mini&s;|ter of peace, whom the count of Richmond thought great enough to &s;oar above humanity, can I carry war into my country? Shall a brother &s;ee me again, at the head of ho&s;tile foreigners, de|voting our faire&s;t provinces to all the mi&s;eries of &s;laughter and de&s;olation. Alicia&mdash;I &s;hould for|feit all her tenderne&s;s &s;he would overwhelm me with her hatred&mdash;with contempt. And what mu&s;t I appear in my own eyes? A mon&s;ter of horror! You love me, Sire: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> nothing to me that can tarni&s;h my glory. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> would &s;ooner die."&mdash;"At lea&s;t," interrupted Henry, "receive a &s;lender proof of my e&s;teem. I will give you the &s;word of Con&s;table of England."&mdash;</P>
<P>I can only an&s;wer, Sire, by a new refu&s;al. This high dignity would oblige me to draw the &s;word again&s;t the king of France, my uncle; and never, never &s;hall he have to reproach me with &s;uch a violation of duty."</P>
<P>The intelligence which the Prince received from Brittany accelerated his return. He had &s;carcely left the Engli&s;h court when he learned that the Mar&s;hal De Dinan had departed this life His fortune &s;eems now to a&s;&s;ume a different a&s;pect
<PB N="26" REF="034417_0026_0FFD9770AF050490">
he indulges a thou&s;and plea&s;ing reveries: he an|ticipates a thou&s;and &s;cenes of exqui&s;ite delight and uninterrupted joy.</P>
<P>Proceeding towards Nantes, accompanied by his gentleman, he perceived a crowd of &s;pecta|tors, near a ca&s;tle, a few leagues from that city. He di&s;covers a &s;plendid proce&s;&s;ion: he &s;ees a young lady weeping, and encircled by many fe|male attendants, who were &s;upporting her in their arms: he approaches, he recollects&mdash;it is the adorable Alicia, whom Montauban was con|ducting to the altar, with the con&s;ent of her fa|mily and of Francis, who had &s;uffered him&s;elf to be overcome by the per&s;ecutions of his favorites. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe this &s;cene: the Prince, followed by his attendants, ha&s;tens to Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan, beholds her fainting, and forcing her from the arms of her women, places her, with the &s;ame precipitation, in tho&s;e of two chevaliers that were devoted to him, and whom he ordered to commit her to the care of one of his female relations, who&s;e re&s;idence was near the &s;pot. And now the arms were glitter|ing: Arthur, enraged to &s;ee his prey thus forced from him, endeavored to repo&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of it, and, at the head of his party, to wreak his ven|geance on the little troop that attended his rival. The latter exclaims, "Hold; &s;u&s;pend your rage: 'tis mine to combat for Alicia: Montauban is my only object. Approach, ra&s;h youth: I will de|rive no advantage from the re&s;pect which thou owe&s;t to the blood of thy &s;overeign. I love I adore Alicia, and thou dare&s;t to di&s;pute her with
<PB N="27" REF="034417_0027_0FFD97731E4079F0">
me! Be my equal now, that thou may'&s;t mea&s;ure &s;words with the man who mo&s;t dete&s;ts thee. Let one of us tinge this ground with his blood, and Alicia &s;hall be the conqueror's."</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly draws his &s;word, and, bidding Montauban to do the &s;ame, he commands his at|tendants to remain impartial &s;pectators of the com|bat. It begins with mutual fury. The Prince receives a wound: the blood &s;lows; and the at|tendants were going to interfere. "Forbear," &s;aid he, "I have &s;till &s;trength enough to pierce the bo&s;om of my enemy."&mdash;Their rage rekin|dles: Montauban is overthrown; "I die," &s;aid he, with a faltering voice: his friends rai&s;e him from the ground, and carry off their vanqui&s;hed lord; while the conqueror and his e&s;cort ha&s;ten to the ca&s;tle to which Alicia had been conveyed.</P>
<P>Who can imagine the con&s;ternation of the beautiful Alicia, when &s;he beheld her lover, now &s;inking under a wound, which, in his impati|ence to fly to her, he had utterly di&s;regarded. In the &s;evere illne&s;s that followed, he experien|ced all the affecting a&s;&s;iduity, that unbounded tenderne&s;s could in&s;pire. To his the noble youth, perhaps, was indebted for his recovery: and, in proportion as the apprehen&s;ions of Alicia, when her lover was at the wor&s;t, had bordered upon de&s;pair, were her endearing ec&s;tacies of expre&s;|&s;ion when he was pronounced to be out of dan|ger. "Divine Alicia," &s;aid the Prince, in one of the&s;e delicious moments, "I cannot yet be re&s;tored to life, till I am permitted to call you my
<PB N="28" REF="034417_0028_0FFD9774ABDA5D38">
wife. Let us prevent the return of a kind of in|ce&s;&s;ant fatality that pur&s;ues me. If I have only a few days to live, let me at lea&s;t die on the bo|&s;om of all I love. Let it be read on my tomb, <HI>The hu&s;band of Alicia repo&s;es here.</HI></P>
<P>How weak mu&s;t be the &s;ugge&s;tions of prudence to the ardent &s;olicitations of &s;uch a lover! In vain did Mademoi&s;elle de Dinan repre&s;ent to him the fatal con&s;equences of an union, to which the duke, his brother, had not yet con&s;ented. The Prince would li&s;ten only to the violence of his love. He a&s;&s;embles &s;ome of his gentlemen to be witne&s;&s;es of the ceremony, which was perform|ed by his chaplain. The Prince of Brittany is at la&s;t the happie&s;t of men. He has wedded&mdash;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the deare&s;t, the mo&s;t adorable of women; and Alicia, on her part, rejoices in a hu&s;band, or rather in a lover worthy of all her love.</P>
<P>Montauban had experienced a kind of re&s;urrec|tion. The thir&s;t of vengeance had re&s;tored him to life. He was di&s;tracted by all the emotions of rage, when he learned that his happy rival was united to Alicia by ties which death alone could di&s;&s;olve. Every thought, every effort of his &s;oul was now devoted to the de&s;truction of the Prince.</P>
<P>The great object with Arthur and his parti&s;ans was to poi&s;on the weak mind of Francis with &s;u&s;|picions of which it was too ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible; and, &s;o well did their artful in&s;inuations &s;ucceed, that the duke no longer regarded his brother, but
<PB N="29" REF="034417_0029_0FFD977723EAEA70">
as a guilty &s;ubject, who&s;e puni&s;hment it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ha&s;ten.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that appearances were not very favorable to the prince. His marriage, ac|compli&s;hed in &s;ome mea&s;ure by violence, was re|pre&s;ented as an outrageous defiance of the &s;ove|reign authority of his brother. His ab&s;ence from the court &s;eemed al&s;o a tacit declaration, that he intended no more to appear there. The principal head of accu&s;ation, that was urged a|gain&s;t him in all its forms, turned upon his un|bounded partiality for the Engli&s;h. He had been &s;o imprudent as to &s;end one of his gentle|men, Thomas de Le&s;quen, to London, to &s;olicit the payment of his pen&s;ion, which had been for &s;ome time in arrears. He even complained in his di&s;patches of the &s;everity of his brother to him; and he more than once touched upon the &s;canty e&s;|tabli&s;hment of his hou&s;hold. The&s;e letters, being intercepted, were &s;o many demon&s;trative proofs to Francis, that his brother was courting the pro|tection of the King of England. This appre|hen&s;ion gave reality to all the phantoms which it plea&s;ed the artful Montauban to pre&s;ent to his &s;o|vereign. He continually imagined that he &s;aw the Engli&s;h invading Brittany, and tearing the ducal coronet from him, to place it on the head of his brother.</P>
<P>The prince, however, &s;o far from being occu|pied by a &s;ingle object of ambition, was &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="30" REF="034417_0030_0FFD977A89F76058">
to no other happine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Ali|cia.

His enemies repre&s;ented the&s;e foreign archers to the Duke as &s;o many &s;ecret emi&s;&s;aries, who kept up the &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ention and revolt that actuated his brother.

<P>The Con&s;table, to whom the Prince had giv|en an account of his emba&s;&s;y, in a very circum|&s;tantial letter, had retired di&s;&s;atisfied with the Duke his nephew. He could not forbear, however, to write a letter of expo&s;tulation to him on his unnatural conduct to his brother; and while he urged every argument with the dignity of the Con&s;table and the Uncle, he forgot not the re&s;pect which was due from the &s;ubject to the Sovereign. This letter &s;eemed to make a great impre&s;&s;ion on the Duke, but Montauban, Hin|gant, and d'E&s;pinai, &s;oon recovered their won|ted &s;way. They would not appear openly to con|tradict a nobleman in &s;uch high credit as the Count of Richmond, who could not but have a great a&s;cendancy over his Sovereign.

At the &s;ame time, they contrived that a|nonymous intimations &s;hould be &s;ent to him, re|pre&s;enting his ruin as inevitable if he complied with the invitation of his brother.

His letter, replete with in&s;ulting mena|ces, was confided to the care of Hingant, who undertook to deliver it him&s;elf at Guildo. They doubted not that all po&s;&s;ibility of reconciliation was cut off from the unfortunate Prince; and that, on the peru&s;al of &s;uch a letter, he would fly into the mo&s;t ungarded invectives, which they would not fail to report. The plot &s;ucceeded beyond their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectation. When Hingant arrived at Guildo, he found the Prince in the mid&s;t of his Engli&s;h archers.

He indi&s;po&s;ed that Monarch towards the Prince, by repre&s;enting him as the mo&s;t zealous friend of the King of England, and an unnatural brother, who was on the point of revolting. He men|tioned the offer which Henry had made him of the &s;word of Con&s;table of England; and, at length, he prevailed upon Charles to &s;end a troop of hor&s;e to arre&s;t him. The Duke and his ba&s;e accomplices had contrived, that this &s;tretch of authority &s;hould be exerted by the King of France in order that the pri&s;oner might be regarded, as a &s;tate-criminal.</P>
<P>The Duke of Brittany had left the Court of France: the Count of Richmond, di&s;plea&s;ed with his conduct towards his brother, had not been re&s;erved in his expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;&s;atisfaction, and had even forborne to vi&s;it him. He is in|formed that a con&s;piracy has been formed again&s;t his nephew, the author of which had found means to intere&s;t in their plan the King of France. He forthwith repairs to that Monarch: "Am I rightly informed, Sire? The ruin of an unfortu|nate Prince is in agitation.

They have repre&s;ented him to me as a &s;editious &s;pirit, that panted for nothing more ardently than for an opportunity of inviting the Engli&s;h into his country; that, moreover, he dete&s;ted the French and their Sovereign."&mdash;The King added, that this la&s;t circum&s;tance had particularly affected him.&mdash;"Sire," an&s;wered the Count, a&s;toni&s;h|ed at what he heard, "you have been deceived.

<P>The Count, profiting of the King's permi&s;&s;ion, lo&s;es not a moment. He repairs with all expedi|tion to the Duke of Brittany, at Dinan.

Some guards appeared&mdash;"Madam, we have orders to &s;epa|rate you."&mdash;What is not my hu&s;band at liberty?" &mdash;"We obey, Madam, the commands of our So|vereign. We are to hold no conver&s;ation with you.

The Prince remains motionle&s;s; he is thunder&s;truck. Fetters are brought to him.&mdash; "Fetters?

the emotions they feel.&mdash;"There is nothing then in nature unfeeling but my brother! Tell me, I conjure you, what can have drawn upon me this exce&s;s of inju&s;tice and barbarity? Whither do you lead me? To death? Ah, dear Alicia! I &s;hall never &s;ee thee more."</P>
<P>The guards an&s;wer only by &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of compa&s;&s;ion, which &s;eem to e&s;cape reluctantly from them. They remove their pri&s;oner from Dinan to Rennes; thence to Chaetau Briant, and many other places&punc; and finally to the fortre&s;s of Har|douinaye.</P>
<P>The motive of this barbarous incon&s;i&s;tency in the Duke's conduct may ea&s;ily be divined. His return to nature had not been &s;ufficiently decided, to overcome the repre&s;entations of his brother's per&s;ecutors. Every thing he had &s;aid, in the mo|ments of pa&s;&s;ion, was repeated to the Duke with all po&s;&s;ible aggravations; or rather, the mo&s;t ab|&s;urd calumnies were invented; and even witne&s;|&s;es were &s;uborned to prove, that this victim of human malignity had formed the project of in|troducing the Engli&s;h into his country. In a word, they &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that a per&s;ecution was commenced again&s;t the Prince and it was determined at all events to find him guilty.</P>
<P>The Attorney-general Du Breil received orders to pro&s;ecute him. This re&s;pectable magi&s;trate ha&s;tens to his Sovereign's feet, paints to him all the horrors of the proceedings in which he was about to engage, and refu&s;es to give his &s;anction
<PB N="46" REF="034417_0046_0FFD97A1B37310F8">
to this iniquitous plot. The inflexible Duke ur|ges him to obey, and adds menaces to entreaty. Du Breil, at length, accepts the dreadful com|mi&s;&s;ion, but with the laudable de&s;ign to divert the &s;torm, or at lea&s;t, to weaken its effects.</P>
<P>Alicia had ha&s;tened to throw her&s;elf at the feet of Francis:&mdash;"Ah, my Lord by what unexpect|ed fatality have your &s;entiments changed in &s;o &s;hort a time? You permitted my hu&s;band to weep in your bo&s;om; you even &s;eemed to be affected with his tears; you were &s;o gracious at la&s;t, to grant us his pardon; and now&mdash;now, Sire, they have loaded him with chains; he is dragged from pri&s;on to pri&s;on.

I will remain here: I will expect every puni&s;hment if the &s;lighte&s;t ac|cu&s;ations again&s;t my hu&s;band have a &s;hadow of truth. Alas, his only crime has been to love me too much. Once more, I alone am guilty. On me only ought to be wreaked the vengeance of exa&s;perated jealou&s;y. Let Arthur de Montauban come and pierce my bo&s;om&mdash;but let my hu&s;band, my poor injured hu&s;band, be relea&s;ed."</P>
<P>In vain had the prince&s;s thus &s;acrificed her liber|ty, to &s;ecure that of her hu&s;band. This heroic action did not mitigate his &s;ate. His pro&s;ecution was continued; and the heads of accu&s;ation were tran&s;mitted to the Sene&s;chal of Rennes, in order to be laid before the States of Brittany.</P>
<P>Before this augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly the Count of Rich|mond appeared, like a tutelary god that would ha&s;ten to the protection of a mortal. He addre&s;|&s;ed the States in a &s;peech replete with the manly, unaffected, and pathetic eloquence of a &s;oldier. He entered into a full vindication of the charac|ter and conduct of his nephew; and he demon|&s;trated that the accu&s;ations again&s;t him had no other &s;ource than the implacable hatred of his enemies. Then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Duke, he urged all the con&s;iderations of ju&s;tice, and all the claims of nature. His &s;peech produced the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible effect on the whole a&s;&s;embly; and the Con&s;table retired, not doubting of their ef|fectual interpo&s;ition in favor of his nephew. The

moment he had left the hall, the Vi&s;count of R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">|han went to the Duke: "My Lord, &s;aid he, "may I pre&s;ume to hope that my voice will be heard after the Count of Richmond's? You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that as the relation of Arthur, I might be permitted to take part in his quarrel; but I am the fir&s;t to di&s;approve of his proceedings again&s;t the Prince. From this moment I declare my&s;elf his avowed enemy, if he does not pro&s;|trate him&s;elf before you, and &s;olicit the return of your fraternal tenderne&s;s. Yes, Sire, I conjure you, I entreat you to forgive the Prince. I for|get the affront he has offered to the hou&s;e of Mon|tauban; and I am &s;en&s;ible only to tho&s;e emotions of pity and tenderne&s;s which the &s;ituation of the Prince your brother mu&s;t excite."&mdash;The Vi&s;count now throws him&s;elf at the feet of Francis, and &s;eems &s;till more to influence the whole a&s;&s;embly in favor of the unfortunate Prince.</P>
<P>The Count of Richmond did not doubt that his &s;peech would produce the happy effects that might be expected from it. He received a letter from the king of France, who ordered him to repair to his court immediately; as the Engli&s;h were making new efforts to retake the places we had captured from them. The Con&s;table, who prid|ed him&s;elf in a rigid attention to his millitary du|ty, obeyed the &s;ummons without delay; after having left in Britanny &s;ome tru&s;ty friends; to carry on the good he had begun, and which he con&s;idered as nearly fini&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="034417_0049_0FFD79D02CFB3A70">But this great and good man was ma&s;taken. The States of Brittany refu&s;ed to decide on this important affair. The Prince continued &s;till to groan in pri&s;on; nor was his wife much le&s;s a captive than him&s;elf. The heart of Francis be|came more obdurate than ever. The favorites, by their infamous intrigues, pre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ented the &s;light|e&s;t appearances of any return to &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The Duke cau&s;ed memorials to be publi&s;hed in the Court of France, in which his brother was painted in the blacke&s;t colors. He was de&s;irous of infu&s;ing in the brea&s;t of Charles the too unre|lenting hatred by which he him&s;elf was actuated. Di&s;&s;atisfied with the conduct of the States, he pretended to e&s;tabli&s;h the pro&s;ecution upon new informations; the fir&s;t having afforded in&s;uffici|ent proofs. He &s;aw with regret that the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Attorney-general was indi&s;pen&s;able. He &s;ent therefore for Du Breil. When this re&s;|pectable magi&s;trate appeared, he loaded them with compliments and carre&s;&s;es. He then endeavored to color his proceedings again&s;t the Prince with the appearances of ju&s;tice; and at the &s;ame time he promi&s;ed, what &s;uch atrocious characters are apt to think irre&s;i&s;tible, all the honors and emo|luments which ambition and avarice could de&s;ire, in order to per&s;uade Du Breil to enter into his views&mdash;"Ah! Sire, &s;aid this virtuous magi&s;trate, "you have been plea&s;ed to applaud me for my love of ju&s;tice: but can I de&s;erve that applau&s;e, if I con&s;ent to adopt your pre&s;ent views? Shall

My whole conduct has been actuated by its mo|tives. Your brother cannot long be detained in pri&s;on. It is not <HI>my</HI> province, who am to ac|knowledge only the inflexible power of the laws; it is not my province to become the organ of compa&s;&s;ion; to plead the birth and youth of the Prince your brother; nor to enforce the tender and inviolable claims of nature. I contemplate neither rank nor age; I li&s;ten to no voice but the voice of truth, who&s;e mini&s;ter you have appoint|ed me. It is my duty, therefore, to declare, that the charges brought again&s;t the Prince are in&s;ufficient to convict him."&mdash;"What!" inter|rupted the Duke, "dare you re&s;i&s;t my authori|ty?"

<P>Du Breil, at the&s;e words, left the exa&s;pe|rated Duke. There were moments when the latter meditated the ruin of the venerable man; but he &s;oon adopted different thoughts. The bad man, in &s;pite of him&s;elf, feels a certain re&s;pect for virtue; and this, indeed, is not one of the &s;lighte&s;t torments that di&s;tract him. Francis de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s by legal methods, dropped the per&s;ecution he had commenced, and, in con|cert with his ba&s;e corrupters, formed &s;ome projects to effect the ruin of his brother.</P>
<P>In the mean time the unfortunate Prince was expo&s;ed to all the &s;ufferings which ingenious cru|elty could devi&s;e; and the&s;e &s;ufferings were aug|mented by the dreadful reflection that his Alicia, his adorable Alicia was &s;ubject to the &s;ame unre|lenting inhumanity. One day he received a let|ter from a centinel, which this man, in a whi&s;per, de&s;ired him not to open till he was alone. He is impatient to read it: the gaolers retire: trem|bling and precipitately, notwith&s;tanding his fet|ters, he opens it. From his beloved Alicia! He lavi&s;hes a thou&s;and ki&s;&s;es upon it. He reads all
<PB N="52" REF="034417_0052_0FFD97ABA5E88378">
the affecting effu&s;ions of tenderne&s;s and grief. He learns that this angelic wife, who had given her&s;elf as an ho&s;tage for her hu&s;band, is her&s;elf in captivity; &s;he deplores her fate, in not being per|mitted to &s;hare, in his pri&s;on, the &s;ufferings of her much injured Lord. She a&s;&s;ures him of that invariable love, which, even this accumulation of calamity, is &s;till the delight of her life; and &s;he implores him by all his tenderne&s;s for her, to write to the King of France, to entreat his in|terce&s;&s;ion with his brother; and for her &s;ake too to forget him&s;elf as it were, and to endeavor by every mode of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to di&s;arm the anger of that unnatural brother, and by repeated letters, if po&s;&s;ible, to conciliate his affection.&mdash;How of|ten did the Prince read again and again this pa|thetic letter! How often ki&s;s it, and bedew it with his tears. The &s;oldier, who brought it, fur|ni&s;hed him with the means of writing. His &s;lackened fetters permit him to u&s;e his hands; and he writes to the charming partner of his &s;oul all that augmented tenderne&s;s, and admiration, and &s;en&s;ibility could in&s;pire. For her he promi&s;es to live; for her to forget the proud feelings of his heart; and her injunctions in every in&s;tance to fulfil.</P>
<P>The hatred of Francis increa&s;e with every day; and as di&s;appointed love is inexorable, Arthur de Montauban, on his part, continued to flatter him&s;elf, that the death of the Prince would again put Alicia into his power. Impatient with this hope, he flies to the Duke who had &s;ent for him. He finds him attended by Hingant and Oliver du

Meel, a gentleman devoted to the hou&s;e of Mon|tauban, and one of his favorites in whom the Duke placed implicit confidence. They were de|clared enemies to the Prince of Brittany. "My friends," &s;aid Francis, burning with ungoverna|ble rage, "the laws, you &s;ee, refu&s;e to &s;erve me." The high credit of my uncle has prevented the &s;tates from coming to a deci&s;ion, and has even &s;ilenced my Attorney-general. Arthur, this wretch has cruelly injured you&mdash;he has robbed you of your wife&mdash;could not you undertake to re|venge?"&mdash;"How, my Lord?"&mdash;"You may ea&s;ily under&s;tand me. Cannot you imagine what ought to be the fate of an enemy, who is ab&s;o|lutely in our power?"&mdash;The countenance of Ar|thur fla&s;hes with indignation. There is a grada|tion in profligacy, at which the mo&s;t abandoned may &s;hudder.&mdash;"My Lord&punc;" &s;aid Arthur, "I have rea&s;on to dete&s;t the Prince; but my hatred would never &s;ugge&s;t to me &s;uch a &s;tep. I wi&s;h him torments equal to tho&s;e with which he has di&s;tracted me. As a &s;tate criminal, impatient to betray his country and his Sovereign into the hands of the Engli&s;h, doubtle&s;s merits death. But I! '&s;hall I be his executioner! Shall Arthur de Montauban degrade him&s;elf to &s;uch a degree? Sire, you have not a &s;ubject more devoted to your &s;ervice: But I dare di&s;obey my &s;overeign, when he commands an action, that would cover me with eternal infamy.' Permit me to retire."</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="034417_0054_0FFD97AF927455B0">The Duke appears a&s;toni&s;hed. He cannont conceive the motives of this refu&s;al; that a rival &s;hould he&s;itate a moment to get rid of a rival, when he is put into his power. From extreme weakne&s;s re&s;ults a cruelty as extreme; which was ab&s;olutely what rendered Francis more barbarous than Montauban. The Duke per&s;i&s;ts in his dread|ful project, and addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf next to Hin|gant, who &s;eems to con&s;ent to gratify the inhuman wi&s;hes of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>It is with regret, we confe&s;s, that we draw the picture of &s;uch horrors; a &s;overeign, a brother, permitting him&s;elf to be hurried into &s;uch dread|ful exce&s;&s;es! but it is the voice of hi&s;tory her&s;elf, which is here faithfully recorded; and we cannot too often repeat to men, to what a degree their pa&s;&s;ions, or rather their weakne&s;&s;es, may mi&s;lead them. Francis, who, &s;urrounded by other cour|tiers, might have di&s;played the virtues of Anto|ninus, is become the execration of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Hingant, on the fir&s;t appearances of con&s;ent that had e&s;caped him, felt all the horrors of re|mor&s;e. As &s;oon as he returned home, he &s;ent at midnight to the Attorney-general, reque&s;ting him to come immediately, as he had an affair of the greate&s;t moment to communicate. To this venerable magi&s;trate, in the utmo&s;t di&s;order, and with a faltering voice, he explained his embar|ra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation. The language of Du Breil, in return, was that of virtue her&s;elf when &s;he endea|vors to pre&s;erve her wandering votaries from in|evitable ruin: "There is no room," &s;aid he, to
<PB N="55" REF="034417_0055_0FFD97B2D9451208">
he&s;itate. It is far preferable, at all events, to di&s;obey the Duke, than to offend your con&s;cience and humanity. It is the voice of con&s;cience that now expo&s;tulates with you&mdash;that voice which would pur&s;ue you, were you &s;eated on a throne. The favor of a Sovereign is not to be compared to that &s;weet peace, that &s;un&s;hine of the &s;oul, which attends the happy man, un&s;ullied by reproach." &mdash;In a word, after a variety of other excellent ob&s;ervations, he exhorted the he&s;itating courtier to ab&s;ent him&s;elf immediately from court, and to fly, in cour&s;e, from guilt and infamy, and re|mor&s;e.</P>
<P>Hingant followed this advi&s;e: he ab&s;ented him|&s;elf from court. Francis exa&s;perated to find his cruelty thus di&s;appointed, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf next to Oliver du Meel, who, le&s;s &s;crupulous than Hin|gant, undertook every thing in concert with Ro|bert de Bou&s;&s;el, one of the guards of the Prince of Brittany.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Prince had found means to &s;end to the King of France a very long letter, which contained all the particulars of his dreadful &s;itua|tion. He informed that Monarch, that for three year pa&s;t, he had been wa&s;ting away his life in fetters, without having once had the liberty of producing his defence. His approaching death, he &s;aid, was inevitable, unle&s;s &s;ome protector of &s;uffering humanity would interpo&s;e in his favor. He concluded his letter (in which all he felt for his beloved Alicia was pathetically urged) by im|ploring the King to &s;ummon him to France, and
<PB N="56" REF="034417_0056_0FFD97B544B48B48">
to be him&s;elf his judge. "From your maje&s;ty only," &s;aid he, "I expect ju&s;tice. If I am guil|ty, you will puni&s;h me: if innocent, I &s;hall be ju&s;|tified by equity it&s;elf."</P>
<P>This letter was blotted in many places by the Prince's tears. Nor could Charles read it without weeping. In this &s;ituation he is &s;urpri&s;ed by his Chamberlain. William de Ko&s;nyvinen, a Cheva|lier of the highe&s;t probity:&mdash;You weep, Sire!

This interpo&s;ition was too re&s;|pectable to be oppo&s;ed. Alicia in her retreat, or rather in her pri&s;on, received this intelligence, with tran&s;ports of joy. Nor did the unfortu|nate Prince experience a revolution le&s;s &s;atisfac|tory.

To this dete&s;table being the con&s;pirators had recour&s;e; and him they brib|ed to fabricate, in the name of Henry, a letter addre&s;&s;ed to the Duke of Brittany, demanding the in&s;tant enlargement of the Prince, and threa|tening, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, to pour a con&s;iderable army into his dominions. The Duke, highly exa&s;perated at this letter, of the authenticity of which he had not a doubt, in&s;tantly revoked the order he had given to relea&s;e the Prince; and, li&s;tening only the dictates of his rage; he vowed from that moment his de&s;truction, which he &s;aid, he had but too long deferred. In a word, the Admiral of France was di&s;mi&s;ed, with|out that &s;ucce&s;s in his negociation of which he had not once made a que&s;tion. The cabal more|over, by their &s;ecret intrigues, had contrived to irritate the Engli&s;h, who actually declared war again&s;t the Duke, and demanded the enlargement of his brother; a circum&s;tance which could not fail to augment a thir&s;t of vengeance that was now become in&s;atiable.</P>

blow was the only an&s;wer that the Prince of Britany received, Then all his fortitude for&s;ook him: he bur&s;t into a torrent of tears. "Great God! could I ever expect to be treated with &s;uch indignity? has my brother given &s;uch orders? Could he not be &s;atisfied with the &s;ufferings I have endured? Mu&s;t he add infamy to them?"&mdash; But the&s;e mon&s;ters, &s;o far from being di&s;armed by expo&s;tulation and complaint, repeated their ill treatment. They removed from him that kind attendant who had enabled him to write to his wife and to the king of France; and he was ut|terly deprived of the &s;weet &s;atisfaction of hearing from Alicia, who was now more &s;trictly guarded than ever.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t abandoned men are incapable, &s;ome|times of re&s;i&s;ting the impre&s;&s;ions of pity; &s;o much is that &s;entiment natural, as it were, to the hu|man heart.

Barbarity is an impre&s;&s;ion that is foreign to you: it fatigues the &s;oul, and is ever productive of di&s;gu&s;t and remor&s;e.

<P>How omnipotent is Love! Had he been affect|ed by his own &s;uffering only, the Prince certain|ly would never have de&s;cended to &s;uch humilia|ting expre&s;&s;ions: but the fate of his beloved Ali|cia was to be decided; and the heart that truly loves, is &s;en&s;ible to a kind of pride, in thus vo|luntarily humbling it&s;elf for the dear object of its affection. What &s;acrifices are there which co&s;t

more than that of life! Humiliation is the &s;ad con|&s;ummation of misfortune; and, when pride is the victim, we have no other left to offer.</P>
<P>The unhappy pri&s;oner counts the day, the hours, the moments: he receives no an&s;wer. In the angui&s;h of de&s;pair, he writes another letter, if po&s;&s;ible more humiliating and affecting &s;till. He implores the &s;peedy &s;entence of death as a relief from in&s;upportable mi&s;ery; he implores his inexorable brother not to extend the pur&s;uit of vengeance beyond the grave; but to &s;pare, at lea&s;t, his memory; and to protect in her widow|hood the wretched and forlorn Alicia.&mdash;But in&s;tead of the&s;e letters, which, one would imagine, mu&s;t have melted the mo&s;t obdurate bo&s;om, the Duke had received others full of reproaches and menaces. The&s;e were counterfeited by the exe|crible Peter de la Ro&s;e. Francis, exa&s;perated by the&s;e letters, no longer affected moderation. It had been reported to him that the Prince, in a fit of de&s;piration, had declared that he would put an end to his life. "He may di&s;po&s;e of it as he plea&s;es," coldly an&s;wered the barbarian. The &s;lighte&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of a Sovereign are gathered with avidity; nor are Courtiers wanting to give them with ea&s;e an interpretation favorable to their Ma&s;ter's views. The words which the Duke had dropped, did not e&s;cape the enemies of the Prince, who in&s;tantly concerted the dete&s;table project of getting rid of their pri&s;oner. They prepared an order in the name of Francis, for the execution of the Prince. This order was carried to the keeper of the Great Seal for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;anction.
<PB N="65" REF="034417_0065_0FFD97CADA5C65D8">
Eon de Baldwin, which was the name of this ex|cellent man, (and &s;uch names, for the honor of humanity, and the con&s;olation of virtue, ought to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity) Eon de Baldwin, peremptorily refu&s;ed to put the &s;eal to this act of impo&s;ture and iniquity. He lo&s;t his place, and, gained immortal honor. The order, at length received its legal form from a more complai&s;ant hand, and Oliver du-Meel was charged to put it in execution.</P>
<P>The Con&s;table, who was &s;till obliged to be at the head of the army, could only conti|nue to importune the King of France by reiterat|ed di&s;patches. The enemies of the Prince want|ed not re&s;ources to prejudice Charles again&s;t his nephew, notwith&s;tanding the ince&s;&s;ant repre&s;en|tation of the virtuous Ko&s;nyvinen. By what &s;trange fatality has fal&s;hood thus almo&s;t ever an acce&s;s to the great?</P>
<P>Du Meel was now given to under&s;tand, that he mu&s;t ha&s;ten the unravelling of this abominable plot. He ob&s;erved to he&s;itate, whether from the powerful influence of remor&s;e, or from his appre|hen&s;ions that the Duke might afterwards repent, and puni&s;h him for a pliability &s;o fatal. Promi|&s;es, rewards, governments, a variety of dazzling anvantages for him&s;elf and his accomplices, are all di&s;played, and are too powerful at la&s;t. The Prince is now thrown into a dungeon &s;till deeper, and full of water. The grated window here o|verlooked

the ditch that &s;urrounded the fortre&s;s. It being now determined to &s;tarve their wretched victim, &s;everal days elap&s;ed without &s;upplying him with any kind of food.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Prince feels all the horror of his approaching fate. He utters the mo&s;t lament|able crimes: he implores the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all the pa&s;&s;engers whom he can perceive on the other &s;ide of the ditch: he extends his &s;uppliant hands through the bars. "It is the Prince of Britta|ny," he cried, "it is the Prince of Brittany, who be&s;eeches you for God's &s;ake, to be&s;tow a little bread and water."&mdash;No one dur&s;t &s;top even to hear him; &s;o much were all apprehen&s;ive of &s;uf|fering the &s;malle&s;t indication of pity to e&s;cape. How few are the exalted minds that can venture to undertake the defence of humanity, at the ex|pen&s;e of per&s;onal intere&s;t&punc; And how much ea&s;ier is &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the yoke of tyranny!</P>
<P>A poor woman, who was wont to &s;olicit chari|ty near the Ca&s;tle, was greatly affected by the de|plorable &s;ituation of the Prince. The name of this re&s;pectable creature is unknown; while the world is pe&s;tered with the names and &s;urnames of &s;o many illu&s;trious villains, who in reality, &s;hould he the reproach and execration of mankind. Are ingratitude and cruelty then natural to the human heart? Or, are the unfortunate alone endeed with &s;en&s;ibility? This woman, who had &s;carce a mor&s;el of bread her&s;elf to &s;upport a mi&s;erable ex|i&s;tence, had the re&s;olution to de&s;cend by night into the ditch, and to convey to the pri&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

his window, or rather &s;piracle, that mor&s;el of bread, and a &s;mall jug of water.&mdash;"My Lord," &s;aid &s;he, "I give you all I have. I would die to &s;erve you. Speak&mdash;what can I do for you? Alas! the great folks are then &s;ometimes as much to be pitied as we are! Oh, my Lord, cannot I be yet more u&s;eful to you?"&mdash;The Prince is &s;o af|fected by this generous action, that the tears, for &s;ome moments, interrupt his voice: at la&s;t, bro|ken by &s;obs, it finds a vent: It is you, excellent creature, that thus come to &s;uccour me, while every one el&s;e&mdash;my brother"&mdash;He cannot pro|ceed: he is choaked by tears.&mdash;"My Lord," re&s;umed the good woman, "I am certain the Duke cannot know your &s;ituation: I am deeply affected with it. Believe me, I will go and beg my bread with greater earne&s;tne&s;s than ever. I will bring every day whatever I can get. Oh, my Lord, it &s;hall all be yours&mdash;a very little will &s;uffice me."&mdash;The Prince now experienced &s;ome mitigation of mi&s;ery. How con&s;olatory is pity! He ince&s;&s;antly repeated: "This then is the only bo&s;om I have been able to &s;often!"</P>
<P>This woman, the heroine of &s;entiment, wait|ed for the hour of darkne&s;s, to bring her noctur|nal tribute of bread and water to the Prince. He could not &s;ee her again without apprehen&s;ions for her &s;afety: "If you &s;hould be di&s;covered," &s;aid he, "your life is in danger."&mdash;"Ah, my Lord," &s;he an&s;wered, "what is the ri&s;que of my life, compared to the &s;atisfaction of prolonging yours"&mdash;The Prince a&s;ks her &s;everal que&s;tions: he would fain learn from her what was the &s;itua|tion

<P>The good woman ran to throw her&s;elf at the feet of a Cordelier, who was her confe&s;&s;or. She related to him what &s;he had done for the Prince of Brittany: &s;he de&s;cribed the &s;ituation in which &s;he had found him? and &s;he &s;oon prevailed upon the good Friar to repair to the pri&s;oner. This man, worthy to fulfil the &s;acred functions of his mini&s;try, and who was actuated by its benevolent &s;pirits, expo&s;es him&s;elf to the danger of being apprehended, and follows the woman, who con|ducting him in the dark, brings him to the grat|ed window. She calls the Prince, who can find no words &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ive of his grateful feelings: "My Lord," &s;aid the Cordelier, "I only fulfil my duty; and who ought to fly to the &s;uccour of mi&s;ery, if not to the mini&s;ters of Re|ligion! Religion is the friend of the unfortunate: her bo&s;om is open to their complaints; and &s;he teaches us to &s;acrifice all, even life it&s;elf to her. The dictates of religion are more powerful than the common impre&s;&s;ions of humanity. Command then my zeal and be&s;t &s;ervices. Gracious God! what &s;avages! Are they men, are they Chri&s;ti|ans that treat you thus?"&mdash;The pri&s;oner with an

affecting air, extends an arm wa&s;ted away, to the Friar: "Alas, it is my brother!&mdash;I perceive," added he, "by the&s;e &s;entiments, the character of that true religion that in&s;pires you. Yes, Re|ligion only could have rendered you &s;o compa&s;|&s;ionate, &s;o charitable! I am for&s;aken by all the world. There are none to whom I can expre&s;s my &s;ufferings but God; and from him alone can I hope for compa&s;&s;ion. Believe me, generous &s;ouls," addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Friar and the woman, "&s;hould Heaven re&s;tore me to the world, my whole exi&s;tence &s;hall be employed to convince you both how deeply I am penetrated by your heroic goodne&s;s. Ah! I have found then two friends before I die."&mdash;"Oh, my Lord," an|&s;wered the woman, "we are the per&s;ons oblig|ed.

<P>The pri&s;oner now thought he could tru&s;t this worthy creature with a commi&s;&s;ion that required &s;ome addre&s;s. It was to gain admittance to the Prince&s;s, and to engage her to come there to &s;ee her dying hu&s;band. "If her hand," &s;aid the Prince, "could clo&s;e my eyes&mdash;if &s;he could receive my la&s;t &s;igh&mdash;go, my worthy benefactre&s;s, exert every effort.

The Friar is now en|gaged in admini&s;tering, according to the cu&s;tom of the Romi&s;h Church, the la&s;t con&s;olations of Religion. His penitent gives an ingenious reca|pitulation of his faults, and deplores them with the mo&s;t &s;incere contrition.

<P>The good father had not the power to an&s;wer; he wept bitterly with the pri&s;oner, who took his hand through the bars, and bedewed it with his tears: "Adieu, my dear benefactor, adieu once more. See the Duke, and forget not to &s;ay to what a tribunal I have cited him. But I have done with men: I now bid adieu to the world; I throw my&s;elf into the arms of God: he only can know the truth: he alone is the avenger of in|nocence."</P>
<P>The goaler and his attendants, who had hoped that hunger would rid them of their pri&s;oner, are

a&s;toni&s;hed to find him &s;till alive. He had con|cealed, in a corner of his dungeon, &s;ome pieces of bread, and a jug of water. Alas! what &s;u&s;te|nance for the brother of a Sovereign!</P>
<P>Oliver du-Meel cannot divine by what kind of prodigy his hopes are thus defeated. The wretch|es who breathed nothing but the death of their victim, and who dreaded that a return of frater|nal tenderne&s;s, in the heart of Francis, might de|prive then of the fruit of their vengeance, gave du-Meel to under&s;tand, that he mu&s;t ha&s;ten the end of his pri&s;oner. It was re&s;olved therefore to poi&s;on him. They affected therefore to com+pa&s;&s;ionate his &s;ituation; and &s;ome &s;oup was brot, which &s;o far from reviving him, was to put a pe|riod to his exi&s;tence. But the &s;trength of his con&s;titution overcame the effects which du-Meel expected from the poi&s;on; and the Prince &s;trug|ged again&s;t death, which, as it were, inve&s;ted him on every &s;ide.</P>
<P>He yields a moment to the violence of &s;uch complicated woes. That &s;leep which &s;prings from the exce&s;s of &s;ufferings, and which may be regarded as the bounty of nature, that tender mother ever intent to aid us; this overpowering &s;leep clo&s;ed the eye-lids of the pri&s;oner. He hears him&s;elf called by an affecting voice: he ha|&s;tens to the window: "Is it true? By what mir|acle? It is you, dear Alicia, it is you! In what a dre&s;s! A faint light of the moon permitted him to de&s;tingui&s;h objects. The Prince&s;s, (for it was indeed no illu&s;ive vi&s;ion) the Prince&s;s could not

forbear from uttering a piercing cry, when &s;he beheld her hu&s;band in this deplorable &s;ituation. She &s;unk, clinging to the bars, which &s;he be|dewed with her tears: "Dear Prince&mdash;dear hu&s;|band&mdash;is it thus a barbarous brother treats you? Oh!

My death is inevitable. But I have &s;een you, deare&s;t, be&s;t of women. It was the favor I implored of God, my &s;oul protector: he has granted it, and I now die content."</P>
<P>The good woman had found means to conquer every ob&s;truction.

Ali|cia, by means of a &s;heet cut into a proper di&s;gui&s;e, had contrived to leave her apartment in the night; and having put on the dre&s;s of the poor woman, to whom &s;he had left her own clothes, and been in&s;tructed in what manner &s;he &s;hould cro&s;s the ditch; &s;he had gained, under this concealment, the dreadful habitation of her lord! "No, dear|e&s;t Prince," &s;aid &s;he, impre&s;&s;ing her ki&s;&s;es and tears on one of his hands, "you &s;hall not die: I will go and embrace the knees of the cruel author of our woes: I will either &s;often his obdurate heart, or he &s;hall plunge the dagger in my bo|&s;om. It is my hu&s;band&mdash;my hu&s;band who &s;uffers

all the&s;e torments, who eats the bread of poverty! &mdash;Oh, Heaven! Heaven! can&s;t thou permit inju&s;|tice to enjoy &s;uch a triumph?"</P>
<P>A &s;udden noi&s;e is heard: torches are perceiv|ed; and a number of guards are di&s;tingui&s;hed. In an in&s;tant, the&s;e &s;avages ru&s;h through the ditch, and &s;eize the Prince&s;s, who &s;hrieking, clings to the bars, determined not to be torn from her hu&s;band: "Oh, mercile&s;s tigers, let us die at lea&s;t together. Will you refu&s;e us even this con&s;olation?"&mdash;"Barbarians," exclaims the Prince, "come hither; plunge your weapons in my bo&s;om; let not an innocent wife be the ob|ject of your rage. On me, on me only wreak your vengeance!"</P>
<P>The guards are deaf to both. The poor wo|man, in a dre&s;s &s;o un&s;uitable to her condition, had been apprehended; but neither menaces, nor even more violent treatment had been able to ex|tort her &s;ecret. A child, who was accidentally near the &s;pot, where Alicia had exchanged her dre&s;s, di&s;covered all. The good woman was thrown into a dungeon; and the almo&s;t expiring Prince&s;s was conveyed back to her apartment, where &s;he was treated with the utmo&s;t &s;everity of confinement.</P>
<P>The Duke had ju&s;t taken Avranches from the Engli&s;h: he was on the point of &s;etting out to &s;leep at Mount St. Michael, when he was inform|ed that a Friar de&s;ired to &s;peak with him in pri|vate. Already did his &s;oul experience the tor|ments

in&s;eperable from guilt. In vain he remov|ed from place to place, the idea of his brother ince&s;&s;antly pur&s;ued him, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> into his heart, and excited that angui&s;h, that terror of him&s;elf, which nothing could di&s;&s;ipate. He heard or fan|cied that he heard, the mo&s;t lamentable cries: it was, if one may &s;o expre&s;s it, an in&s;urrection of all his &s;en&s;es; and every object, as it were, a&s;&s;umed a voice, to reproach him for his inhu|manity. Nature, then, cannot be offended with impunity. How &s;weet the rever&s;e which Virtue knows: under the mo&s;t calamitous trials, &s;he pre&s;erves her wonted &s;erenity, and, in the favor|able te&s;timony of con&s;cience, finds a con&s;olation for every woe!</P>
<P>When the courtiers had retired, the Friar was introduced to the Duke, who thus addre&s;&s;ed him: "My good father, what is your bu&s;ine&s;s with me?" &mdash;"To prevent, my Lord, the height of inju&s;|tice and barbarity; to urge the rights of Nature and Religion.

<P>The Con&s;table whom he imagined to be at the head of the French army, ha&s;tily enters the a|partment, trembling with rage: "Wretch," he cried, "thou ha&s;t now arrived at the con&s;umma|tion of thy crimes!"&mdash;"My uncle, they will not be committed.

Yes, du-Meel perceiving that neither hunger nor poi&s;on could de&s;troy my nephew, has cau&s;ed him to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by wretches, worthy of executing thy abominable plea&s;ure. Yes, all is over! Thy bro|ther is no more! The King has permitted me to fly to his &s;uccour; and I am come to behold his corp&s;e, to weep over his &s;ad remains!

thee for ever. I will in&s;tantly repair to the King, who is now &s;en&s;ible how much he has been de|ceived; and I &s;hall demand ju&s;tice on thee and thy vile accomplices."</P>
<P>The Con&s;table, without waiting for a reply, ha&s;tily retired. The Cordelier was going to follow him: "My father," cried the Duke, al|ready &s;truck with the mo&s;t dreadful terror, "&s;top; remain with me; &s;upport me under this exce&s;s of mi&s;ery. The prediction is fulfilled: I hear&mdash;I &s;ee him&mdash;the dreadful &s;pectre&mdash;he pur|&s;ues me! Where &s;hall I hide my&s;elf? Great God! is there now no hope for me?

<P>In fact, remor&s;e, and &s;uper&s;tition united their dreadful force; and per&s;ecuted the Duke with uncea&s;ing terrors. Murmurs were heard in ev|ery part of Brittany: they augmented every day: the &s;oldiery felt a degree of horror in marching under the banners of &s;uch a leader. The faults of the unhappy Prince were all forgotten: his misfortunes were the melancholy theme of every tongue.

He expired &s;oon after in the arms of the Cordelier, who had never quitted him. He often pronounced before he died the name of his brother, who&s;e pale and bloody apparition he con&s;tantly imagined in his pre&s;ence. Sometimes he conjured him to grant his pardon; and often he would ca&s;t the odium of his guilt on the wick|ed Courtiers that had mi&s;led him. By a codicil to his will, he ordered a foundation to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed for the repo&s;e of the &s;oul of Giles of Brit|tany, at the Abbey of Boquien, where that Prince was interred.

<P>AT the age of twenty-two, Mrs. Falkland being left a widow, with an only daugh|ter, retired into the country, that &s;he might de|vote her future life to the education of her Ma|tilda; an employ &s;he was well qualified to under|take, as &s;he joined to the accompli&s;hed lady a well improved mind, and an elegant under&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>Under the tuition of &s;uch a mother, Matilda made a rapid progre&s;s in every branch of u&s;eful and ornamental knowledge; but unhappily for her, Mrs. Falkland was determined to rai&s;e the declining <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of her family by a profitable marriage.</P>
<P>The beauty and accompli&s;hments of Matilda, who had now reached her &s;eventeenth year, were
<PB N="84" REF="034417_0083_0FFD97F832FA79E0">
the topic of conver&s;ation among all the neigh|boring gentleman, and many offered them&s;elves as canditates for her affection. In this number was Edward Stanley, the only &s;on of a gentle|man who lived near the mother of Matilda. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fortune &s;ufficiently above the reach of want; was hand&s;ome in figure, and elegant in ad|dre&s;s. The&s;e however, were his lea&s;t important qualities&mdash;his temper was open and generous; his mind well &s;tored with u&s;eful learning, and gifted with every virtue that dignifies the nature of man. He had long admired Matilda. There &s;eemed to be, in her, a mind above "the level of the vulgar great." She had al&s;o been an at|tentive ob&s;erver of Edward; and di&s;covered in him, a di&s;po&s;ition, and education, much &s;uperi|or to that of any other gentleman. Mr. Stanley was, what every country gentleman &s;hould be, a man of real &s;en&s;e and &s;ound morals. He had be|&s;towed the greate&s;t care in educating his &s;on, and had the abundant &s;atisfaction to &s;ee the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven attend his endeavor. He often admired the great under&s;tanding of Mrs. Falkland, and the amiable character of her daughter; as per|&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of far more &s;en&s;e and accompli&s;h|ments, than many to whom Providence had giv|en abundance of wealth, and be&s;towed greater means of improvement. He had commenced an acquaintance with Mrs. Falkland and it was at the&s;e little interviews the flam<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> love caught the heart of Edward. He was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> longer the &s;ame; the ro&s;e of health, which before bloomed in his countenance, for&s;ook his cheek; he was never happy, but in the company of Matilda.

She &s;aw the angui&s;h which di&s;tracted his heart, and often the tear of pity &s;tole down her check when conver&s;ing with him. But &s;he knew her mother's determination; and reflected that, by encouraging a hopele&s;s attachment, &s;he would only bring mi&s;ery on both. She revealed to her mother the &s;ituation of Edward; and de&s;ired, as the only remedy, &s;he might be &s;ent to London, to try whether ab&s;ence would not obliterate her from his mind.</P>
<P>The departure of Matilda was carefully con|cealed from Edward. After waiting three days, in hopes of &s;eeing her, his anxiety could no lon|ger be &s;u&s;tained. He ventured to enquire whe|ther &s;he was gone; and could ill conceal his agi|tation, at the information. "To London!" &s;aid he; "and when will &s;he return?"&mdash;Not the&s;e two months," replied Mrs. Falkland. "Two months!" exclaimed Edward, and ru&s;hed out of the room.</P>
<P>He begged of his father to let him go to Lon|don for a few days. Mr. Stanley would have granted any thing el&s;e. "No, my dear Edward," &s;aid he; "I cannot con&s;ent you &s;hould mix in tho&s;e &s;cenes of riot and di&s;&s;ipation with which that city abounds, without a proper guide to &s;teer your cour&s;e. I intend &s;hortly to go thither my|&s;elf, and you may accompany me." Edward thanked his father, with a heavy heart; who nev|er gue&s;&s;ed the rea&s;on of his &s;on's demand.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="034417_0085_0FFD97FD189B0AB0">Matilda returned; and he embraced the earlie&s;t opportunity of paying his re&s;pects. She received him with &s;uch indifference, as &s;hot a dagger thro his heart. He parted from her nearly in a &s;tate of madne&s;s; &s;leep fled his pillow, and he &s;pent the night almo&s;t bordering on de&s;pair.</P>
<P>But the en&s;uing day fully explained the fatal cau&s;e of her behavior. An elegant carriage, with four hor&s;es appeared at Mrs. Falkland's door, accompanied with a proportionable number of at|tendants in &s;plendid liveries. Lord Oglethorpe was u&s;hered in, as the lover of Matilda.</P>
<P>Edward &s;carcely believed what he &s;aw. He took particular care to review his lord&s;hip, as he entered his coach, and gave him a look of merit|ed contempt: his lord&s;hip was the very e&s;&s;ence of a <HI>modern beau</HI>&mdash;too fine to be a man.</P>
<P>During a month, Lord Oglethorpe paid the greate&s;t attention to Matilda; he then &s;olicited her hand. Mrs. Falkland, elated to the very pinna|cle of imaginary bli&s;s, would now hardly own acquaintance with Mr. Stanley; who fore&s;aw, with infinite concern, the ruin of her daughter. But all his friendly cautions were treated with di&s;dain.</P>
<P>At length, the day was fixed; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Matilda, by marrying a nobleman, would <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the height of her mother's ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="034417_0086_0FFD97FEAD7947F8">Edward had been diligent to gain every infor|mation concerning Lord Oglethorpe; and the arrival of a gentleman from London, who came on a vi&s;it to his father, afforded an opportunity.</P>
<P>Mr. Melville was the &s;on of an eminent mer|chant in the city; a youth of a virtuous mind, and liberal education: by him he learned, that his lord&s;hip po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a plentiful portion of rich|es; and this was all, for he had neither under|&s;tanding or virtue. Edward perceived, in the mind of Melville, a congeniality of &s;entiments with his own, and determined to make him the friend of his youth. He related to him the whole of his love for Matilda, and her intended union with Lord Oglethorpe; then a&s;ked his advice con|cerning his future conduct.</P>
<P>Mr. Melville advi&s;ed him to go &s;ome di&s;tance from home, during the nuptials, as the &s;pectacle would be too painful for his feelings: but fir&s;t to obtain an interview with Matilda, and know how far her inclinations were in uni&s;on with her in|tended marriage. If he &s;hould find it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee her before he departed, to write a letter, which he would engage &s;he &s;hould receive.</P>
<P>Edward u&s;ed every means in his power to gain admi&s;&s;ion to Matilda. Finding all his efforts vain, he wrote the following letter&mdash;
<LETTER>

<P>He left this letter with his friend; who faith|fully delivered it to Matilda, the morning pre|ceding her nuptials. The unau&s;picious morn now arrived, when Matilda was to fall a victim to her mother's power. The ceremony was performed by his lord&s;hip's chaplain, at her mother's hou&s;e; after which, they departed to a hou&s;e belonging to a relation of Lord Oglethorpe's, &s;ome miles farther in the country.</P>

<P>"O! what a wretch!" &s;aid &s;he, after reading the letter; and &s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s on the floor. At this moment a &s;ervant entered the room, to inform her that a gentleman wi&s;hed to &s;ee her. The notice was &s;carcely delivered, when Edward appeared. At the &s;ight of him, &s;he &s;hrieked vi|olently&mdash;"Merciful Father!" cried Edward, "what di&s;a&s;ter is this!" She could make no re|ply, but gave him the letter.

<P>In a few hours &s;he recovered, &s;ufficiently to proceed to her mother's; but waited at Mr Stan|ley's, while Edward unfolded the dreadful &s;cene to Mrs. Falkland. "Good God!" exclaimed her mother, "Matilda ruined! The crime is mine. It was my mi&s;erable pride that has cau&s;ed this; and the remaining days of life will now be "few and evil!"

<HEAD>MIRANDA, OR THE DISCOVERY.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN INGOLDSBY was a &s;oldier of fortune; the younger &s;on of a younger branch of a great and re&s;pectable family; but his &s;word was his patrimony; and having enter|ed early into the profe&s;&s;ion of arms for a main|tenance, he pur&s;ued it with that enth&s;iua&s;tic &s;pi|rit of honor, which is dictated by the con&s;idera|tions of family pride, the hope of fame, the dread of di&s;grace, and the mo&s;t ardent love of glory, and of his country.</P>
<P>He married, too, like a &s;oldier: intere&s;t made no part of his compo&s;ition. He &s;aw and admir|ed his Emma; he formed an acquaintance with her; and found her mind the counterpart of her per&s;on: young, hand&s;ome, and gallant, he met with no difficulty in in&s;piring mutual regard, or in obtaining the con&s;ent of her father, a venera|ble, re&s;pectable, unbeneficed clergyman.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="034417_0096_0FFD981809CB6A70">Happine&s;s is neither confined to fortune or con|dition: the amiable couple loved, and love &s;up|plied all deficiencies. Love re&s;trained the gaity of Mr. Ingold&s;by's di&s;po&s;ition; and taught his amiable partner the prudence nece&s;&s;ary to regu|late expences, which were to be bounded by the pay of a lieutenant of foot.</P>
<P>Nor did the increa&s;e of their family, (for Hea|ven ble&s;&s;ed them with a female infant within the fir&s;t year after their marriage) add to their diffi|culties; it &s;erved only to augment the attention of the father, and the circum&s;pection of the mo|ther; and they rejoiced in the participation of their &s;canty po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to the offspring of love, the pledge of the tendere&s;t affection.</P>
<P>In the care and &s;uperintendance of their dar|ling daughter, did their years roll on in peacea|ble and humble content. If they heaved a &s;igh, it was for their Miranda's future welfare, if they breathed a wi&s;h, it was to &s;ee her placed in a &s;it|uation which might guard her again&s;t the attacks of poverty, and the de&s;igns of iniquity: from the former they were aware beauty and accom|pli&s;hments would prove no &s;hield; and they trem|bled when they reflected, that they might prove the mo&s;t powerful incitements to the latter.</P>
<P>The &s;weets of life are not to be enjoyed with|out its accompanying emb<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">erments. The&s;e di&s;|quietudes were augmented by a circum&s;tance as unexpected as it was alarming: they were in a moment de&s;tined to be torn from each other's

arms; or to purcha&s;e a continuance of the joys they had experienced in &s;ixteen years &s;ociety, by incurring an expence they were unable to &s;up|port, and ri&s;quing dangers and difficuties which female delicacy is little calculated to encounter. The regiment in which Mr. Ingold&s;by &s;erved, received orders to embark for America in tran&s;|ports already prepared for their reception.</P>
<P>On the communication of this intelligence, &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of their little plans of oeconomy and felicity, Mrs. Ingold&s;by earne&s;tly entreated, that &s;he and her daughter might be the companions of his voyage; &s;he enumerated in the mo&s;t lively and affectionate terms, all the advantages that might be derived from keeping their little fami|ly together; and &s;he di&s;played, in all the elo|quence of feeling grief, the horrors that mu&s;t await her and her daughter at the moment of their &s;eparation. No arguments were nece&s;&s;ary to convince him that what he wi&s;hed mu&s;t be right; he folded his Emma and Miranda to his bo&s;om; and whil&s;t he wept over the di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which all he held dear might be expo&s;ed, a &s;mile of approbation bur&s;t through the manly cloud, and he exulted in &s;uch a wife and &s;uch a daugh|ter. All the difficulties which the narrowne&s;s of their finances &s;ugge&s;ted, were obviated by a thou&s;|and arrangements, the ingenious devices of love; and the command of a company, which was con|ferred on Mr. Ingol&s;by before the embarkation, relieved them from no other anxiety than what concerned a future provi&s;ion for their Miranda.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="034417_0098_0FFD981D0EF1DDE0">Few events, differing enough from the com|mon occurences of life to be worth recording, happened either in the cour&s;e of their voyage, or on their arrival at Bo&s;ton: except that the a&s;&s;idu|ities of a young officer of another regiment, who accompanied them in the &s;ame tran&s;port, &s;eemed to have made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of the gentle Miranda; who li&s;tened to tales of love, &s;anctioned by the approbation of her pa|rents, and &s;ighed out her own confe&s;&s;ion in &s;trains of artle&s;s and irre&s;i&s;table harmony.</P>
<P>Mr. Mon&s;on was formed on the model which Capt. Ingold&s;by had in idea fixed on for the hu&s;|band of his Miranda. His manners were as mild as his &s;oul was brave: he carried command in one hand, and affection in the other; and his orders were obeyed with that mingled fear and love, with which inferiors in every &s;tation look up to tho&s;e who neither exert their powers in tyranny, nor &s;uffer them to fall into contempt by in pru|dent and ill-timed indulgence. To the qualifica|tions of a &s;oldier he added tho&s;e which mo&s;t high|ly adorn private life: he was lively, yet &s;teady; generous, without profu&s;ion; and, if his expen|ces ever exceeded the &s;tricte&s;t limits of prudence, the exce&s;s might be attributed to &s;ome acts of benevolence, to which his heart and his pur&s;e were always equally open. Nor was his income limited: for he was the only &s;on of a gentleman of fortune, who had indulged his propen&s;ity to arms at the expence of the mo&s;t acute and ago|nizing &s;en&s;ations; and who, with a parental af|fection as laudable as it is uncommon, &s;ubjected
<PB N="101" REF="034417_0099_0FFD981E944BD8B8">
to no re&s;trictions but in the choice of a wife, and in this grand object of the happine&s;s of his life, had only enjoined him to con&s;ider birth, education, and virtue, as the mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions &s;he could be&s;tow on him.</P>
<P>But both Captain Ingold&s;by, and Mr. Mon&s;on were too regardful of decency and propriety to ha&s;ten an event of &s;o much importance, till the father of the young gentleman had been acquaint|ed with the attachment; and letters from Mr. Ingold&s;by and the lover were prepared to be di&s;|patched by the fir&s;t &s;hips which &s;hould &s;ail for Europe: and the young &s;oldier conquered his impatience, by the &s;ugge&s;tions of con&s;cious dignity and rectitude in this di&s;charge of his fili|al duty.</P>
<P>But alas! the&s;e precautions were &s;oon render|ed fruitle&s;s, by events which di&s;&s;olved the bands of affection, rent a&s;under the ties of mutual love; darkened the faire&s;t pro&s;pects of future happi|ne&s;s, and involved in a gloom, apparently ever|la&s;ting, connubial joys, pre&s;ent and promi&s;ed!</P>
<P>On that day, which will ever he marked with horror in the remembrances of tho&s;e who feel for their country; and which will never revolve without renewing the mo&s;t acute angui&s;h in the bo&s;oms of tho&s;e who&s;e fathers, hu&s;bands, bro|thers, or relatives &s;uffered in the dreadful con|flict! that day, when the attack of Bunker's

Hill occa&s;ioned a carnage which thinned the Bri|ti&s;h ranks, and laid her heroes in the du&s;t! Cap|tain Ingold&s;by, and Mr. Mon&s;on, &s;tood foremo&s;t in the bloody conte&s;t; accident had placed them in the &s;ame brigade, and they &s;ought and fell to|gether; the body of the young officer being car|ried of by the Americans, and the mortally wounded Captain conveyed to the habitation of his wretched wife and daughter!</P>
<P>To attempt the de&s;cription of &s;uch a &s;cene, would require a pen in&s;pired by pity her&s;elf: let tho&s;e who wi&s;h to paint it, figure to them&s;elves a brave officer, un&s;tained by a &s;ingle act in life which he could po&s;&s;ibly recollect with regret, ex|piring of wounds received in the &s;ervice of his country; and with all the dignity of virtue, admi|ni&s;tering con&s;olation to the objects of his late&s;t af|fection! let them repre&s;ent the wife &s;inking under the load of accumulated woe, on the bo&s;om of the dying po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of her heart, and calling back his fleeting &s;pirits to guard her again&s;t giv|ing way to the impul&s;es of grief, and the impre&s;|&s;ions of de&s;pair! let them pourtray youth, beau|ty, and virtue, &s;tabbed with a double blow; and bereft, in one moment of a father unequalled in affection, of a lover unrivalled in fidelity, ex|claiming by turns for each, and with all the frenzy of inarticulate rage, arraigning the ju&s;|tice of Heaven, and the villainy of man! And, if they de&s;ire to revel in all the luxuries of woe, let them attend to the heart-piercing &s;hriek, which announced the departure of the brave, the regret|ed Ingold&s;by.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="034417_0101_0FFD982102755560">We &s;hall not follow the unfortunate mourners through the various progre&s;&s;ions of grief, from keen and piercing angui&s;h, to &s;ilent and corrod|ing melancholy: in the la&s;t &s;tate, they embarked for England; after having received every atten|tion which the governor and garri&s;on could offer, as a tribute to the memory of the decea&s;ed, and to the virtues and excellencies of the &s;urvivors.</P>
<P>On their arrival in England, the ca&s;e being made known to their benevolent &s;overeign, they were &s;oon relieved by his bounty from the appre|hen&s;ions of indigence; and on a pen&s;ion granted to the mother, and continued to the daughter in ca&s;e of her death, they retired to a village very remote from the metropolis, and rendered de&s;ira|ble to them by its being the re&s;idence of a mai|den <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Captain Ingold&s;by, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable portion of the virtues of her brother, and an affection for her niece which could only be exceeded by that of her mother.</P>
<P>As the fortunes of this lady, though large enough to gratify her wi&s;hes, were limited, &s;he and the widow agreed to join their narrow in|comes, and as Miranda was their mutual care, &s;o it was the earne&s;t wi&s;h of the aunt, that &s;he might be accommodated at their mutual expence; and they entered on their little plan with the mo&s;t affectionate intentions of rendering it as agree|able and comfortable to each other, as the nature of a &s;ituation, in which they each felt, though in different degrees, the pangs of &s;oftened but unabated grief, would admit.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="034417_0102_0FFD98260E575360">But as no retirement will conceal the charms of beauty, nor any circle, however confin|ed, prevent the fame of accompli&s;hments from &s;preading beyond its limit; Mr. Maxwell, a neighboring gentleman of fortune and character, was &s;oon captivated with the reports of Miran|da's excellencies, and as he was a widower not much pa&s;t the prime of life, and had yet an in|clination again to wear the &s;ilken chains of ma|trimony, he determined to vi&s;it the fair; and if he found her worthy his heart, to offer his hand; an offer which be doubted not would be accepted, as his per&s;on was far from being di&s;agreeable, his manners poli&s;hed and elegant, his character un|exceptionable, and his fortune very far above any expectations which orphan indigence could form.</P>
<P>To a man of Mr. Maxwell's con&s;equence, few excu&s;es were nece&s;&s;ary for a liberty, which how|ever improper among people of equal fortunes, cu&s;tom has unworthily commi&s;&s;ioned the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of wealth to take, with tho&s;e whole &s;ituations in life are le&s;s eminently favored by the &s;miles of the blind and undi&s;tingui&s;hing godde&s;s.</P>
<P>But Mr. Maxwell was not of a di&s;po&s;ition to avail him&s;elf of this unmerited &s;uperiority, he langui&s;hed for a proper introduction, and &s;uffer|ed all the pains of impatience till accident threw in his way the gratification of his wi&s;hes. The hou&s;e which the ladies inhabited was adverti&s;ed for &s;ale; and, under pretence of an intention to purcha&s;e, he obtained permi&s;&s;ion, in con&s;equence
<PB N="105" REF="034417_0103_0FFD982A4C0122A8">
of a proper reque&s;t, to in&s;pect it on a particular day, which at his in&s;tance had been named by the fair tenants.</P>
<P>On that day, Mr. Maxwell ha&s;tened to the vil|lage, and in the earlie&s;t moment that had been mentioned; he alighted at Mrs. Ingold&s;by's door, not without the mo&s;t flattering expectations that the politene&s;s of the ladies would prove in&s;trumen|tal to the attachment of the only object he had in view.</P>
<P>Nor where his hopes di&s;appointed; after he had viewed the hou&s;e and gardens with an air of an intended purcha&s;er, the refre&s;hment of tea was propo&s;ed to him, and being accepted with|out he&s;itation, he was introduced to the fair, the amiable, the &s;till mourning Miranda.</P>
<P>Prepared by the univer&s;al voice to admire, love was the immediate con&s;equence of a vi&s;it, which he reque&s;ted leave to repeat in terms with which civility could not refu&s;e to comply; and a very few days confirmed Mr. Maxwell the ardent, and the profe&s;&s;ed lover of Miranda.</P>
<P>But her heart was &s;till engaged, nor could &s;he abandon even an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion; &s;he wi&s;hed to indulge her regrets through life, and was aver&s;e to every propo&s;ition which tended to turn the edge of her melancholy, and mo&s;t to tho&s;e which offered a new object for the affections.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="034417_0104_0FFD982BD13AACD0">Yet the character, the fortune, the unobjec|tionable per&s;on of Mr. Maxwell, were urged to her by her only friends, with &s;uch energy, but mildne&s;s of per&s;ua&s;ion, that, enforced by the de|clarations of her admirer, that he hoped not to in&s;pire her with love, but to engage her friend|&s;hip, and opinion, that in accepting the hand of a man advanced in years, &s;he offered le&s;s violence to her former engagement, than if &s;he yielded to the &s;olicitations of a young and plea&s;ing lover; &s;he was prevailed on to promi&s;e Mr. Maxwell the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes; and a day, at no very con&s;iderable di&s;tance, was named for the completion of his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary preparations now engaged the attention of Maxwell and the two matron ladies; whil&s;t Miranda, like a &s;acrifice adorned with gar|lands for the altar, pa&s;&s;ively yielded to the a&s;&s;idu|ities of her friends, and &s;uffered the ornaments of her per&s;on, and the intended provi&s;ions of &s;ettlement, to be adju&s;ted, without interfering in the management, or participating in the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>But, a very few mornings before the appoint|ed day, when the intended nuptials were to take place, as Miranda was at breakfa&s;t with her mo|ther and aunt, a &s;ervant put into her hands a let|ter, which being known by the &s;uper&s;cription to be from Mr. Maxwell, &s;he immediately deliver|ed it to Mrs. Ingold&s;by, who, to the utter a&s;to|ni&s;hment of both her auditors, read aloud the contents of it as follows:

<HEAD>CHARIESSA</HEAD>
<P>CHARIESSA was the younge&s;t child of a wor|thy and active gentleman, who, though his name had a place in the will of a very opulent father, &s;uffered many hard&s;hips, in the early part of his life, from tne &s;cantine&s;s of his patrimony. His father was infected with that rediculous, or rather dete&s;table, pride, by which many per&s;ons are tempted to leave their younger children in ab|&s;olute indigence, from the vain and ab&s;urd pro&s;|pect of aggrandizing an elde&s;t &s;on; a project which was &s;ugge&s;ted to the old gentleman we are &s;peaking of by his di&s;covery of a genealogical table, which unluckily enabled him to trace his progenitors to the reign of Edward the Fourth, when it appeaaed that one of his ance&s;tors was high-&s;heriff for the county in which he re&s;ided.</P>
<P>As the father of Charie&s;&s;a had keenly felt all the evils ari&s;ing from an unju&s;t di&s;tribution of property, he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to leave whatever for|tune he might him&s;elf acquire, in equal propor|tions among his children. From a very fortu|nate marriage, and much unexpected &s;ucce&s;s in life, he was enabled, at his decea&s;e, to leave to his &s;on, and to each of his daughters, a portion equivalent to &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="034417_0109_0FFD9838081B7080">The &s;on had been educated in one of the fir&s;t merchantile hou&s;es in London; and, at the time of his father's death, was ju&s;t returned from a tour to the continent, where he had been engag|ed in fixing his future corre&s;pondencies, before he &s;ettled as a merchant.</P>
<P>He had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome few years in trade, when his uncle the elde&s;t brother of his father, died without i&s;&s;ue, and left him the family e&s;tate, on the condition of his quitting commerce entirely, and re&s;iding at the ancient &s;eat of the Trac|kums. He obeyed the injunction of the will, and retired into the country with his wife; who, tho a celebrated beauty, was a lady of infinite di&s;cretion, and di&s;tingui&s;hed thro life by the mo&s;t prudent attention to a numerous family.</P>
<P>Squire Trackum, as we &s;hall now call him, changed his manners with his place of abode; and quitted the grave addre&s;s of the important merchant, to a&s;&s;ume the boi&s;trous jocularity of the E&s;quires that &s;urrounded him. In a &s;hort time he was &s;o completely metamorpho&s;ed, that, in his fir&s;t vi&s;it to town, he greatly a&s;toni&s;hed and entertained his old acquaintance of the city; but his real character remained th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">me.</P>
<P>He now concealed, under the ma&s;k of ru&s;tic jovialty, that uncommon &s;hare of worldly wi&s;dom, which he formerly hid under the man|tle of &s;erious and &s;olemn frankne&s;s: he even car|ried into the field of rural &s;port that ince&s;&s;ant at|tention to intere&s;t which he u&s;ed to exert upon
<PB N="113" REF="034417_0110_0FFD98398C2688E0">
Change; and, in the very moment when he was galloping after a hare, would calculate the chan|ces of &s;ettling a daughter in marriage, or let|ting a farm to advantage. In one unguarded moment of real frankne&s;s, when he was warmed by the bottle, he boa&s;ted, to an intimate friend, that he never pa&s;&s;ed ten minutes in the company of any man, without con&s;idering how he might derive &s;ome degree of pecuniary or intere&s;ted advantage from his acquaintance.</P>
<P>Before the &s;quire a&s;&s;umed his rural character, Erinnis, the elde&s;t of his two &s;i&s;ters, had married a gentleman of a di&s;tant county, who was re&s;|pected as the de&s;cendant of an ancient family, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a large e&s;tate.</P>
<P>The unmarried Charie&s;&s;a, who&s;e temper, &s;ui|table to her plea&s;ing, elegant per&s;on, was &s;pright|ly, generous, and un&s;u&s;pecting, conceived a mo&s;t lively attachment to the wife and children of her brother, whom &s;he always regarded with &s;uch af|fectionate confidence, that &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be guided, in all important points, by his judge|ment and advice.</P>
<P>The provident <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ire, con&s;idering that a rich maiden aunt is an amiable prop to the younger branches of a very fruitful hou&s;e, had very early determined within him&s;elf, that his &s;i&s;ter, Chari|e&s;&s;a, &s;hould pa&s;s her life in &s;ingle ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and he doubted not but that he had &s;ufficient ad|dre&s;s
<PB N="114" REF="034417_0111_0FFD983BF948D738">
to confirm her an old maid, by the artful device of perpetually expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t friend|ly &s;olicitude for her marrying to advantage. He had per&s;uaded her, on his leaving London, to chu&s;e for her re&s;idence a provincial town, in the neighborhood of Trackum Hall; and by thus &s;ecuring her within the reach of his con&s;tant ob&s;ervation, and &s;tudying to increa&s;e the influ|ence which he had already acquired over her frank and affectionate &s;pirit, he took the mo&s;t ef|fectual precaution for accompli&s;hing his wi&s;hes. As Charie&s;&s;a was in that rank of life, in which matrimonial approaches are made rather in a &s;low and ceremonious, than a rapid and ardent man|ner, the watchful &s;quire had &s;ufficient time and opportunity to counteract the attempt of every man whom he found guilty, or whom he &s;u&s;pect|ed, of a de&s;ign on the heart and hand of this de|voted ve&s;tal.</P>
<P>By inducing his innocent &s;i&s;ter to believe, that he mo&s;t heartily wi&s;hed to &s;ee her well married; and by per&s;uading her, at the &s;ame time, to think highly of his penetration into the real characters of men&mdash;he brought the good and credulous Cha|rie&s;&s;a to &s;ee all her lovers exactly in that unfavor|able point of view, in which his own intere&s;t and artifice contrived to &s;hew th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">. In con&s;equence of her affectionate reliance <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> a&s;&s;iduous coun|&s;el, &s;he ab&s;olutely rejected the overtures of three gentlemen, who were generally e&s;teemed unex|ceptionable; but the friendly zeal of the vigi|lant &s;quire had di&s;covered that they were all ut|terly unworthy of &s;o excellent a creature as Cha|rie&s;&s;a.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="034417_0112_0FFD983F58BF9DF8">The mean de&s;igns of &s;elf intere&s;t are frequent|ly puni&s;hed with the heavy tax of &s;olicitude, con|cerning the many dangers to which they are com|monly expo&s;ed. It happened thus with our pru|dent and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;quire. He triumphed, in|deed, by putting every &s;uitor to flight, while Charie&s;&s;a re&s;ided within the reach of his indefat|igable attention; but then were periods, in which he was tormented by the re&s;tle&s;s appre|hen&s;ion of lo&s;ing all the fruits of his ungenerous labor.</P>
<P>Attached as &s;he was to the per&s;on and family of her brother, Charie&s;&s;a did not cea&s;e to love or to vi&s;it her &s;i&s;ter Erinnis; and &s;he re&s;olved to pa&s;s the &s;ummer of every third year at the hou&s;e of that lady, who was &s;ettled in a very di&s;tant part of the kingdom. Erinnis was one of tho&s;e extraordinary women, whom nature, in a fit of perver&s;ity, now and then produces, apparently for no purpo&s;e but that of proving a burden to them&s;elves, and a torment to all around them. Erinnis had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, like her &s;i&s;ter, youth and beauty, opulence and under&s;tanding; but &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them only to &s;hew that, valuable as the&s;e endowments are, they are utterly in&s;ufficient to &s;ecure happine&s;s or e&s;teem, without the noble ble&s;&s;ings of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">volent heart and a regulated mind. She was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rly married to Sir Gregory Gourd, a placid and hone&s;t baronet, who, in ra|ther an advanced &s;ea&s;on of life, had united him|&s;elf to this young lady, by the advice of his re|lations, for the two following purpo&s;es: fir&s;t, to pay off an incumbrance on his ancient e&s;tate with a part of her ample dower; and, &s;econdly, to
<PB N="116" REF="034417_0113_0FFD9841C3FDD1F0">
provide a male heir to that honorable hou&s;e, who&s;e antiquity he contemplated with a compla|cent and inoffen&s;ive pride. The luckle&s;s knight was doubly di&s;appointed in the&s;e his two favorite projects. As to the fir&s;t, indeed, he paid off a mortgage; but &s;oon found him&s;elf involved, by the profu&s;ion of his wife, in much heavier debts. As to his &s;econd hope, whether he had entered too far into the vale of years to be gratified in &s;uch an expectation; or whether nature, who had certainly given no maternal tenderne&s;s to the temper of Erinnis, had therefore wi&s;ely deter|mined that &s;he &s;hould never be a mother, I will not pretend to decide; but certain it is, that, vehemently as &s;he panted for this event, Erinnis had never any near pro&s;pect of producing a child. This di&s;appointment, from what cau&s;e &s;oever it might proceed, had &s;uch an ince&s;&s;ant tendency to inflame the natural contemptuous malignity of her &s;pirit, and &s;he in&s;ulted the poor &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive old knight with every humiliating outrage which an imperious wife can inflict on a terrified and un|re&s;i&s;ting hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Her pa&s;&s;ions, naturally vehement and acrimoni|ous were inflamed into fits of frenzy by her wi&s;hes in this point being di&s;appointed&punc; but, in the mo|ments of her mo&s;t intempe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> ab&s;urdity and ex|travagance&punc; &s;he con&s;tantly retained a con&s;idera|ble portion of hypocritical cunning; and, how|ever in&s;olent and injurious in her treatment of all her other relations, &s;he for ever expre&s;&s;ed, though in a di&s;gu&s;ting manner, the fonde&s;t af|fection for her &s;i&s;ter Charie&s;&s;a. This affection
<PB N="117" REF="034417_0114_0FFD984348599E78">
was partly real, and partly pretended. There was, indeed, &s;o engaging, &s;o pure, &s;o &s;ublime a &s;pirit of indulgent benevolence, in the char|acter of Charie&s;&s;a, that it could not fail to in&s;pire even malignity and madne&s;s with &s;ome portion either of love or re&s;pect. But this pa&s;&s;ionate at|tachment of Erinnis to her &s;i&s;ter aro&s;e chiefly from a mercenary motive.</P>
<P>Though Charie&s;&s;a was, in general, ble&s;&s;ed with good health and good &s;pirits, &s;he was frequently &s;ubject to certain feveri&s;h attacks, in which her life was &s;uppo&s;ed to be in danger; and Erinnis, who had &s;quandered enormous &s;ums in the public di&s;play of much aukward magnificence, and in many private articles of expence, was grown &s;o needy and rapacious, that &s;he looked forward, with all the eagerne&s;s of avarice, to the &s;everal thou&s;and pounds which &s;he was &s;ure of gaining if the good angel Charie&s;&s;a took her flight to Hea|ven. In her mo&s;t &s;tupifying fits of intoxication, and in her mo&s;t furious &s;allies of ill-humor, &s;he never lo&s;t &s;ight of this expected legacy. Cha|rie&s;&s;a, who&s;e pure and generous mind could hard|ly have been induced to believe that &s;uch an idea ever entered into any human brea&s;t, not only ne|ver &s;u&s;pected the profu&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of this pre|tended love, but gave a very &s;ingular and touch|ing proof of the genuine &s;i&s;terly affection and confidence with which her own heart was in&s;pir|ed. It happened that &s;he was attacked by a very dangerous fever, at the hou&s;e of Erinnis. After many days confinement to her bed, being alone with her phy&s;ician, &s;he &s;aid to him, in a very
<PB N="118" REF="034417_0115_0FFD9845B5A7A438">
calm and unembarra&s;&s;ed manner&mdash;"Pray, Sir, tell me very frankly, do you think I &s;hall die?" As her di&s;temper had ju&s;t taken a favorable turn, the doctor very chearfully replied&mdash;"No, indeed, my good Madam." Upon which &s;he exclaimed, in a very affectionate tone&mdash;"I am glad of it, for the &s;ake of my dear &s;i&s;ter!" Nor was this the exclamation of a feeble mind, afraid of death, and di&s;gui&s;ing that fear under the ma&s;k of affec|tion.</P>
<P>Charie&s;&s;a was a genuine Chri&s;tian, who, hav|ing weighed both this world and the next in the balance of rea&s;on and of faith, was at all times perfectly prepared for her natural di&s;&s;olution. Her exclamation was the dictate of a mo&s;t gene|rous and di&s;intere&s;ted tenderne&s;s. She had &s;een the artful Erinnis counterfeit &s;uch inordinate &s;or|row during the cour&s;e of her malady, and &s;he &s;o fondly believed the truth of that well-di&s;&s;embled affection, that, totally free from every &s;elfi&s;h idea, the innocent Charie&s;&s;a con&s;idered only the joy with which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her &s;i&s;ter would contem|plate her unexpected recovery.</P>
<P>Though her own affectionate and un&s;u&s;pecting temper made her receive with an amiable credu|lity, all the lavi&s;h endearments of Erinnis, Cha|rie&s;&s;a was very far from being blind to the many glaring faults of her turbulent &s;i&s;ter; but &s;he generou&s;ly found an excu&s;e for them, which con|verted them at once into objects of the tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion. She per&s;uaded her&s;elf, that the &s;al|low and ferocious appearance, in the altered
<PB N="119" REF="034417_0116_0FFD98491C931810">
countenance of Erinnis, proceeded entirely from a di&s;ea&s;e in her liver; and that all the furious perver&s;ities of her temper were owing either to the internal pain of this cruel di&s;order, or to the medicines which &s;he was tempted to try.</P>
<P>Under the influence of this kind idea, &s;he mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly laboured, not only to apol|ogize for the offen&s;ive irregularities in the con|duct and manners of Erinnis, but to counteract, to the utmo&s;t of her power, all the mi&s;chievous effects of her capricious and vindictive ill-hum|our. She rai&s;ed and comforted the poor knight, whenever &s;he &s;aw him reduced to a painful &s;tate of humiliation by the frantic in&s;olence of his wife; &s;he con&s;oled and rewarded the innocent and un|fortunate dome&s;tics, whenever &s;he found them &s;tript and di&s;carded by their turbulent and of|fended mi&s;tre&s;s; in &s;hort, &s;he endeavored to main|tain a degree of order, ju&s;tice, and decency, throughout a numerous hou&s;hold, under the cha|otic dominion of a malevolent, intoxicated fury: and whoever has &s;een her in this trying &s;ituation, has &s;een a perfect image of Charity; "believ|ing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things."</P>
<P>Although the peaceable and chearful &s;pirit of Charie&s;&s;a could find but little plea&s;ure in a hou&s;e like that of Erinnis, a compa&s;&s;ionate affection to her &s;i&s;ter made her very exact in her &s;tated vi&s;its: their duration always extended to &s;ix months, and &s;ometimes amounted to &s;even; a circum&s;tance which did not fail to increa&s;e the tormenting
<PB N="120" REF="034417_0117_0FFD984B917037D8">
fears of her di&s;tant brother Trackum, who al|ways contemplated the return of Charie&s;&s;a into his neighborhood with that &s;ort of &s;atisfaction which is felt by the tamer of a bird, on &s;eeing it, after fluttering to the limits of an exten&s;ive chamber, return, in an ea&s;y and voluntary manner, to the open door of its cage.</P>
<P>Charie&s;&s;a, however, was very far from feeling any degree of con&s;traint: &s;he departed on many of the&s;e di&s;tant vi&s;its, and returned as often to her own man&s;ion, without once &s;u&s;pecting the inquietude which her long ab&s;ence never failed to excite. Indeed, the fearful &s;quire might have &s;aved him&s;elf the pain of many teazing doubts, and many private perplexing enquiries, had he been capable of forming a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the heart and mind of Charie&s;&s;a: but this, indeed, he was not; and though he knew that the mag|nificent but lonely habitation of Erinnis was as much avoided as the den of a &s;avage, yet he trembled at the idea of the lovers that the un|guarded Charie&s;&s;a might meet in that pompous &s;olitude. He was a&s;&s;ured, that a ru&s;tic apothe|cary, and a more ru&s;tic divine, were the only frequent vi&s;itors at this dreary ca&s;tle; but, as he had no confidence in female delicacy or di&s;cretion, and as he found that the man of phy&s;ic and the man of God were both &s;ingle men, and that each would have many opportunities of being alone with Charie&s;&s;a, he greatly feared that &s;he and her fortune might fall a &s;acrifice to one or the other of the&s;e formidable a&s;&s;ailants. This groundle&s;s ter|ror, in&s;tead of being dimini&s;hed by time, in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="121" REF="034417_0118_0FFD984D5038B9A8">
with the increa&s;ing age of Charie&s;&s;a. The &s;quire was very coar&s;e in his idea of old maids: he concluded, that no virgin turned of forty, and left entirely to her own di&s;cretion, could re&s;i&s;t any matrimonial offer whatever; and, as his &s;i&s;ter had reached that deci&s;ive period on her la&s;t vi&s;it to Erinnis, his &s;pirits were not a little depre&s;&s;ed by his de&s;pair of her return in that &s;tate of ve&s;tal purity which he had &s;o zealou&s;ly wi&s;hed her to maintain. At length, however, his ap|prehen&s;ions were effectually terminated by an e|vent which, though much more probable than the dreaded marriage of Charie&s;&s;a, was not &s;o &s;tongly anticipated by the imagination of the di&s;|tant &s;quire. This event was the death of Erin|nis; who, having utterly worn out a good con&s;ti|tution by the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and di&s;graceful intem|perance, died, as &s;he had lived, in magnificent mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The tender Charie&s;&s;a paid the la&s;t office of af|fection to her unworthy &s;i&s;ter; and returned in a calm and pious &s;tate of mind from the abode of joyle&s;s grandeur, who&s;e vanity was now mo&s;t compleatly &s;hewn, to her own peaceful and com|fortable man&s;ion. Her di&s;po&s;ition was &s;till re|markably cheerful; and &s;he took too kind and too virtuous an intere&s;t in the general happine&s;s of the living, to think affected &s;orrow a proper compliment to the dead. She had too clearly &s;een all the various infelicity of Erinnis, not to con&s;i|der her relea&s;e as a ble&s;&s;ed event; and it plea&s;ed
<PB N="122" REF="034417_0119_0FFD9850B9961C78">
Heaven to reward the long and indulgent atten|tion which &s;he had paid to the bodily and mental infirmities of that unhappy relation with many years undi&s;turbed tranquilities to contemplate her intere&s;ting character at this &s;ea&s;on of her life; and, as I believe her to have been, for &s;everal years, one of the happie&s;t of mortals, I &s;hall en|large on the particular circum&s;tances which con|&s;tituted that happine&s;s, and minutely examine that invaluable ca&s;t of mind which enabled her to gain and to &s;ecure the rare&s;t and mo&s;t precari|ous of all human po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Charie&s;&s;a was about forty-two when &s;he returned to a con&s;tant re&s;i|dence in her own quiet and comfortable man&s;ion. She was naturally fond of &s;ociety; and her ea&s;y fortune enabled her to enjoy it in that temperate and rational manner which &s;uited her inclination. Having made many ju&s;t remarks on the different conditions of female life, &s;he was perfectly con|vinced, that &s;he had great rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with her own &s;ingle &s;tate; and no incidents aro&s;e that could make her wi&s;h to change it. Her pa|trimonial fortune had been much increa&s;ed by &s;ome con&s;iderable legacies; and &s;he enjoyed an income which by her prudent regulation of it, not only &s;upplied her with all the u&s;ual comforts of affluence, but furni&s;hed her with the exalted plea&s;ure of conferring happine&s;s on a &s;elected number of indu&s;trious poor. She had a &s;pacious and cheerful hou&s;e, that peculiarly plea&s;ed her own fancy; and a &s;et of intelligent and good-humored dome&s;tics, who were attached, more by affection than intere&s;t, to her per&s;on; and the neighboring &s;eat of her brother afforded her a

<P>Such were the external circum&s;tances that con|tributed to form the happine&s;s of Charie&s;&s;a; cir|cum&s;tances, indeed, highly de&s;irable in them|&s;elves, yet utterly in&s;ufficient to make a woman happy, without tho&s;e noble internal ble&s;&s;ings which were the true riches of Charie&s;&s;a. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the mo&s;t eminent degree, a chear|ful &s;implicity of heart, inexhau&s;tible benevolence, and unaffected piety. It was by the con&s;tant, yet mode&s;t exerci&s;e of the&s;e admirable qualities, that Charie&s;&s;a &s;ecured to her&s;elf, not only more felicity, but even more public regard and atten|tion, than was obtained by &s;ome &s;ingle ladies of her neighborhood, who were undoubtedly her &s;uperiors in the attractive endowments of beauty, opulence, and wit. Charie&s;&s;a, perhaps was ne|ver known in her life to utter a witty repartee; but &s;uch is the lively influence of genuine good-nature, that her conver&s;ation never failed to de|light, and her hou&s;e was frequented as the abode or benevolent vivacity.

that many of my di&s;contented fellow-creatures may be rendered otherwi&s;e by reading the fol|lowing narrative, written with the pen of expe|rience, I beg the favor of you to give it a pa&s;&s;|port to the public.</P>
<P>I was born to the inheritance of a &s;mall pater|nal e&s;tate, the income ari&s;ing from which would, in this age of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation, be reckon|ed a trifling one. Little, however, as it was I could not hope to &s;ee it increa&s;ed as I was not, being an only and a fondled child, with a tender con&s;titution, bred up to any bu&s;ine&s;s, though I re|ceived a very good education.</P>
<P>Having lo&s;t my father and mother as &s;oon as my education was fini&s;hed, I could not help think|ing that what had &s;erved us all three, would un|doubtedly, be &s;ufficient for me alone; e&s;pecially as I looked upon my orphan &s;ituation in a de&s;|ponding light, and had no de&s;ire to live in an ex|pen&s;ive manner.</P>
<P>So violent was my grief, &s;o deep was my af|fliction, on being deprived of my parents, that I gave my&s;elf up to de&s;pair, and accu&s;ed heaven of cruelty for &s;natching them away from me in&s;tead of being thankful for having enjoyed them &s;o long. Time however, and the tenderne&s;s with which the gentleman whom my father had ap|pointed to be my guardian, treated me, allevia|ted my &s;orrow&mdash;My friend&s;hip too for that gen|tleman's &s;on, who was remarkably formed to plea&s;e, who was as amiable in my eyes, as he was

agreeable, and who profe&s;&s;ed the &s;incere&s;t e&s;teem for me, not a little contributed to its alleviation.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s which I enjoyed with my young friend was exce&s;&s;ive, and I thought that nothing could make any addition to it: but while I was pluming my&s;elf on my peculiar felicity, and de|pending upon its continuance, I was extremely di&s;appointed; for the mo&s;t e&s;teemed companion of my heart was obliged to make a voyage to Li&s;|bon, his father's affairs rendering his pre&s;ence at that place ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>During his ab&s;ence, which affected me greatly, I became acquainted with one of the mo&s;t amia|ble girls in the world; and &s;oon fell &s;o de&s;pe|rately in love with her, that I had no re&s;t night or day, becau&s;e I had rea&s;on to believe that her father would think my fortune too &s;mall; and that he would expect a more advantageous match for a girl with her per&s;on and accompli&s;hments&mdash; Then&mdash;then I wi&s;hed, more ardently wi&s;hed, that I had been thrown in a way to improve my patri|mony, and to make it more worthy of the accep|tance of the only woman with whom I could be happy: without whom, indeed, I &s;hould be ac|tually wretched.</P>
<P>I had been fortunate enough, as I thought, to find &s;everal opportunities to make my addre&s;s to the lady; but the dread of being rejected by him, who had alone a right to di&s;po&s;e of her, kept me for a con&s;iderable time in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t rack|ing uncertainty; and I was weak enough to af|front

the memory of my once beloved and reve|rend parents by accu&s;ing them of having been cruelly inattentive to my future welfare&mdash;"Had I been brought up to bu&s;ine&s;s, I might have ena|bled, perhaps, to offer my&s;elf to this adorable creature, without fearing a refu&s;al either from her or her father!"</P>
<P>I was not, indeed, too far advanced in life to &s;ettle to bu&s;ine&s;s; but love engaged my thoughts &s;o much, and forbade me al&s;o to embark my little all on a precarious bottom, that, in&s;tead of endea|voring to increa&s;e my income by indu&s;try, I aban|doned my&s;elf to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>De&s;pair, at length, drove me to a&s;k the father of my Maria for his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>I was as I feared I &s;hould be, repul&s;ed with a peremptory denial.</P>
<P>This was a fini&s;hing &s;troke; I could not &s;up|port it&mdash;I murmured at Providence for not having given me the exact &s;um I wanted, fretted my&s;elf ill, and was &s;oon pronounced to be in danger.</P>
<P>My guardian and his family, who had ever be|haved in the tendere&s;t manner to me, well know|ing the cau&s;e of my di&s;order, informed Maria of my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>She, who had never been aver&s;e to me, on be|ing acquainted with it, flew to her father and with tears in her eyes, intreated him to let her come and &s;ee me.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="034417_0129_0FFD986936730E70">Moved by her &s;orrow, he complied with her re|que&s;t; but he was &s;o much more affected, at her return, by the account &s;he gave of my indi&s;po&s;i|tion, that he con&s;ented to our union.</P>
<P>Our marriage was to be &s;olemnized as &s;oon as my health was re&s;tored; and I believed my&s;elf to be the happie&s;t of men.</P>
<P>My wife's fortune was but little, if at all &s;upe|rior to mine. Her parents, however, reckoning upon her per&s;on and accompli&s;hments, had high|er views for her, and had flattered them&s;elves that &s;he would be rai&s;ed con&s;iderably by her ex|external attractions co-operating with her intrin&s;ic merit: they were con&s;equently, at fir&s;t, rather chagrined to &s;ee their &s;chemes defeated; but finding that &s;he was &s;atisfied with her lot, and that I continued extravagantly fond of her, they al&s;o became more contented.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after our marriage, her grand|father died, and left her only five thou&s;and pounds; but, at the &s;ame time, ordered five thou&s;and more to be paid on the birth of a &s;on; and in ca&s;e of our having only girls to be made over to another branch of the family.</P>
<P>This unkind, this unju&s;t procedure, rouzed my &s;entiments, and I in&s;ulted the memory of the decea&s;ed old gentleman with the keene&s;t invec|tives&mdash;I ought to have been thankful for his hav|ing remembered us at all, as he had a large fami|ly,
<PB N="134" REF="034417_0130_0FFD986AD034D1A8">
who wanted what he had bequeathed to us more than we did.</P>
<P>We were now perpetually wi&s;hing, and wi&s;h|ing with anxiety, to have a boy, to bring &s;o good a legacy home to us; but heaven, ju&s;tly offended, no doubt, at our unrea&s;onable di&s;quietude, &s;ent us only a female, who was to me, in particular very di&s;gu&s;ting merely as a female; and her mother was &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed with her &s;ex as to deny it nouri&s;hment from her own brea&s;t. The poor child, though as fine a one as ever was born, was turned out of the hou&s;e at the tendere&s;t age, not only to partake of the rude accommodations and homely fare of one of the lowe&s;t cottagers, but to run the ri&s;que of imbibing, with the milk of a &s;tranger, all the ill-blood and ill-humors with which that &s;tranger might be filled.&mdash;Thus did we throw away a trea&s;ure, of which we were not capable of e&s;timating the value.</P>
<P>My wife, not finding her&s;elf breeding again, &s;oon began to take a fancy to a different &s;tile of living&mdash;She had hitherto been &s;atisfied with pri|vacy, and paid a proper regard to dome&s;tic oecon|omy, as we were by no means in &s;plendid cir|cum&s;tances; but her di&s;appointment ari&s;ing from the birth of her daughter, had made a change in her temper; and the &s;ociety of &s;ome gay peo|ple of her own &s;ex, with whom &s;he &s;truck up an acquaintance, at fir&s;t, in order to di&s;&s;ipate her un|ea&s;ine&s;s, in&s;pired her with too &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion for plea&s;ure&mdash;Yet was not my fondne&s;s in the lea&s;t abated by her new propen&s;ities.&mdash;I &s;till doated on
<PB N="135" REF="034417_0131_0FFD986E367DA178">
her, and indulged her in the gratification of her heart's every wi&s;h. Ju&s;t about this time I receiv|ed a great deal of plea&s;ure, plea&s;ure very little expected, from my friend Theodore's return from Li&s;bon: his arrival gave me the greater delight, as I had flattered my&s;elf that he would, as a &s;in|cere friend, enjoy by the force of &s;ympathy, the happine&s;s which I felt in my lovely Maria's com|pany.</P>
<P>I flew to him, therefore, immediately, and pre&s;ented him to my wife with the highe&s;t enco|miums on each other, which, indeed, they both de&s;erved, and which they both &s;oon felt, neither proceeded from the extravagance of love, or the romantic ardour of friend&s;hip.&mdash;Few men were more agreeable than Theodore; few women more amiable than Maria.</P>
<P>I now began almo&s;t to forget my late di&s;ap|pointment in the arms of my wife, and in the conver&s;ation of my friend, between whom I &s;pent all my happy hours&mdash;My felicity was, in truth, &s;o complete, that I even thought not of the di|minution of our fortune.&mdash;My felicity, howe|ver,&mdash;(how can we expect permament felicity here?) was &s;oon interrupted.&mdash;My wife fell &s;ick of a fever&mdash;In a few days afterwards &s;he was de|clared to be ha&s;tening to her di&s;&s;olution, and in a few more expired in my arms.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the agonies which my &s;oul endured when I beheld the woman whom I had ever loved to di&s;traction &s;tretched out before

me a lifele&s;s corp&s;e&mdash;I behaved like a mad-man, and, in the height of my frenzy dared, impiou&s;ly dared, to accu&s;e the Almighty of having given her to me only to make me a thou&s;and times more mi&s;erable than I &s;hould have been, if I had never known her, by an early &s;eparation. I &s;tamped&mdash; I tore my hair&mdash;I committed innumerable irreg|ularities. When I grew &s;omewhat le&s;s di&s;turbed, I &s;unk into a &s;ullenne&s;s which nothing could re|move.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of my wife, my friend Theodore was obliged to &s;ettle abroad&mdash;His de|parture occa&s;ioned new murmurings, new im|pieties.</P>
<P>There was now but one object left to at|tract my attention; that object was my little girl, again&s;t whom, from her birth, my bo&s;om was &s;teeled.</P>
<P>Maria now had ju&s;t entered into her fourth year; but having been &s;hamefully neglected both by her mother and me, had contracted a great many low ways, under the tuition of her vulgar nur&s;e. I went to &s;ee her&mdash;but O, &s;harp reproach for having &s;o long &s;tifled parental affection in my bo&s;om&mdash;&s;he &s;creamed at the &s;ight of me&mdash;I was, indeed, a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>Pitying the poor child's &s;ituation, I took her home: however, as I gave my&s;elf no trouble a|bout her education, &s;he only exchanged as &s;he grew up, the coar&s;e dialect of the nur&s;e, for the pert language of the chambermaid&mdash;Forced by recollection to dwell on the lo&s;&s;es I had &s;u&s;tained,

certain of never &s;eeing my beloved wife again, and doubtful with regard to the reappearance of my friend, I &s;at either &s;tupified with &s;orrow, or raving with de&s;pair; unmindful of my moulder|ing fortune; unmindful of my injured daughter.</P>
<P>One day the maid came into my room telling me, that Mi&s;s was cutting her double teeth, and was very ill, adding, that &s;he wi&s;hed I would give her an anodyne necklace, which &s;he knew her mi&s;|tre&s;s had in her cabinet.</P>
<P>On being thus unnece&s;&s;arily, I thought, remind|ed of my wife, I was thrown into a violent rage and in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of my pa&s;&s;ion, &s;everely reprimanded the maid for her officiou&s;ne&s;s; but pa&s;&s;ing &s;oon afterwards through a room in which the young Maria lay on her lap in extreme pain, I was &s;truck with the re&s;emblance between her and her late lovely mother, a little while before &s;he expired.</P>
<P>A &s;igh, which I could not &s;uppre&s;s, heaved my bo&s;om; and as I hung over the innocent, the tears of paternal &s;en&s;ibility ru&s;hed from my eyes, and ru&s;hed down her pallid face.&mdash;I then ha&s;ten|ed to the cabinet to &s;earch for the necklace, or any thing that might probably relieve her.</P>
<P>In turning over &s;everal papers, which were in|termixed with my dear Maria's trinkets, I recog|nized the hand of Theodore.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed beyond expre&s;&s;ion at &s;o unexpected a &s;ight, I opened the letter with precipitation,
<PB N="138" REF="034417_0134_0FFD987489F502E0">
and read it with horror&mdash;I was &s;tabbed with the peru&s;al of it&mdash;Every word planted a dagger in my heart&mdash;It was&mdash;Oh, heaven!

<P>This heart-breaking di&s;covery made me quite furious&mdash;I now exclaimed again&s;t Providence in the mo&s;t daring and irreverent terms, for having &s;uffered me to be &s;o deceived, and de&s;pi&s;ed; &s;o gro&s;&s;ly impo&s;ed upon, and injuriou&s;ly treat|ed.

<P><PB N="139" REF="034417_0135_0FFD9878B6ABCDC8">From that fever, I, with great difficulty, re|covered, and &s;unk into a dejection which almo&s;t rendered me incapable of doing any thing.

in a proper light, and by endeavoring to make me &s;en&s;ible, that under the pre&s;&s;ure of any mi&s;|fortunes whatever, a thorough &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence is as much our intere&s;t as it is our duty.</P>
<P>I now began to reproach my&s;elf &s;everely for having behaved in &s;o unbecoming, &s;o unju&s;tifia|ble a manner; and tried to atone for my pa&s;t ill conduct, by making my&s;elf as well &s;atisfied as the &s;ituation of my affairs, which had been con&s;ide|rably injured by the extravagance of my wife, in con&s;equence of her immoderate love of plea&s;ure, would &s;uffer me to be.&mdash;Yet &s;till I could not bring my&s;elf to behold my little daughter with the eyes of an affectionate parent&mdash;I repined continually becau&s;e my child was not a &s;on, as I &s;hould have had, during the minority of a &s;on, the manage|ment of five thou&s;and pounds, which would have been of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to me. Setting a&s;ide her having been e&s;tranged from me for &s;o long a time, Maria had none of tho&s;e whinings, fond yearnings after me, which children generally have who are trained up under the in&s;pection of their fathers and mothers. Of this want of filial &s;en&s;ibility in my daughter, I complained in the bittere&s;t terms, to my good old neighbor, who told me that I had brought upon my&s;elf the di&s;|quietude which tormented me&mdash;"At the very time," continued he, "that the tender affections take root, you ca&s;t your daughter from you as if &s;he had been an alien; from your unfatherly be|havior, therefore, to her, during her infancy, ari&s;es her attention to you. Folly is its own pun|i&s;hment&mdash;However, it is not yet too late to make

her &s;en&s;ible, by a proper carriage, that you are her be&s;t friend; and po&s;&s;ibly, that de&s;pi&s;ed girl may turn out every thing you can wi&s;h her to be."</P>
<P>I li&s;tened a &s;econd time to the voice of rea&s;on&mdash; I began to apply my&s;elf to the education of my child. I hired, in the place, an elderly woman, recommended by my friend, who had been bred a gentlewoman, but having met with misfortunes, was glad, with a moderate allowance, to under|take the care of my family, and to teach my girl all kinds of needle work: in reading, writing, accompts, geography, French, and mu&s;ic, I was her only in&s;tructor; and by accompanying my in|&s;tructions with many rewards and few puni&s;hments, I at length carried my point &s;o far, as to make her love the father, while &s;he revered the ma&s;ter. I had at the &s;ame time the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee that &s;he improved every day in her per&s;on and manner, and became a very fine girl.</P>
<P>When &s;he was about eleven years old, my ex|cellent friend and neighbor (to whom I was in|debted for all the plea&s;ure I at la&s;t received as a parent, and to whom my daughter was al&s;o in|debted both for her father and her education; as I &s;hould not, probably, have behaved to her in a paternal way, or have taken any pains to render her an accompli&s;hed woman, if I had not been acquainted with him) was &s;uddenly taken ill, and died in a few days.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t news of his death was a blow which almo&s;t &s;tunned me&mdash;So deeply was I affected by it, that I gave my&s;elf up again to murmuring and de&s;pondence.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="034417_0139_0FFD9880A47D3790">While I was throwing out &s;ome very melan|choly effu&s;ions, dictated by de&s;pair, I was in|formed that he had left my daughter in his will, having few relations of his own, and none who were not richer than him&s;elf, ten thou&s;and pounds; five of which I was at liberty to improve by any &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s or traffic, the mo&s;t agreeable to me, till my daughter was &s;ix and twenty: with the other five &s;he was to be inve&s;ted on her being of age. I had, however, only the u&s;e of my five thou&s;and during the &s;tipulated term of years, on condition that I tied up a part of my e&s;tate which would produce an equivalent &s;um at the expir|ation of them, in ca&s;e I &s;hould be guilty of any embezzlements, or be di&s;abled by unfore&s;een contingencies from making a re&s;titution.</P>
<P>This was a noble legacy, as unmerited as it was unexpected; but it admini&s;tered no con&s;ola|tion to me for the lo&s;s of the worthy te&s;tator. The genero&s;ity of my excellent friend I remem|bered every hour with the &s;incere&s;t gratitude, and his &s;eparation from me eve<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> hour with the &s;incere&s;t regret. However, as I paid too great a regard to the memory of him whom I had &s;o ju&s;t|ly and &s;o highly e&s;teemed when living, to neglect the improvement of the &s;um for which I was re&s;|pon&s;ible, I offered my&s;elf to a &s;ober careful man, who had been his book keeper, to go into part|ner&s;hip with him, provided he would thoroughly in&s;truct me in his bu&s;ine&s;s; and he chearfully complied with my propo&s;al, as the &s;tock advanced by me would be of con&s;iderable advantage to him.</P>
<P>In this manner I obeyed my dear decea&s;ed friend's injunctions, and made an hone&s;t old &s;er|vant

of his happy. By &s;trictly attending to the duties of my new employment, I not only kept my mind from dwelling on any di&s;agreeable &s;ub|jects; but, in a few years, trebled the five thou|&s;and committed to my &s;teward&s;hip. When my daughter came of age, I made over ten thou&s;and pounds to her, and married her to a very amia|ble and de&s;erving young man, for whom &s;he had a great affection. With the remaining &s;um, ad|ded to my little patrimony, I re&s;olved to &s;pend the re&s;t of my days in doing all the good in my power, as my daughter and her hu&s;band were in too affluent circum&s;tances to wi&s;h for my decea&s;e. In acts of benificence, therefore, I have &s;pent my time from that happy aera, in &s;upplicating the Almighty's pardon for my pa&s;t offences, and in pouring forth prai&s;es to Him for all the ble&s;&s;ings which he has &s;howered on my unde&s;erving head. &mdash;Never am I &s;o happy, never do I feel &s;uch tran&s;porting &s;en&s;ations, as when I am offering up my fervent than&s;givings to the throne of grace &mdash;More and more am I every hour convinced, that the goodne&s;s of the Deity is equal to his power; that we ought ever to pay the mo&s;t im|plicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his decrees; and that whate|ver he permits to be is permitted for the wi&s;e&s;t ends.</P>
