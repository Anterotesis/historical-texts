<DIV1 TYPE="review">
<HEAD>From the Journal de Paris, May 7, 1786. Strictures on a Poem addre&s;&s;ed to the American Armies.</HEAD>
<P>A GREAT many remarkable circum&s;tances render this little performance worthy of the public atten|tion. It was compo&s;ed in America, in 1782, at the encamp|ment of general Wa&s;hington, when the Briti&s;h &s;till occupy|ing New-York and Charle&s;ton, the great cau&s;e of Ame|rican liberty was not then decided. The author is an American officer, writing in the mid&s;t of the tumult of a camp, and conciliating the occupations and duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, with that &s;ilence and meditation which every poetical compo&s;ition demands. The tran&s;lator is a French general officer (M. le M. de Chattellux) in whom the talents of a great military and literary cha|racter are acknowledged to be blended in a very extra|ordinary degree.</P>
<P>THE object of the work is to animate the citizens of America to the defence of their country. The marcl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the poet is ea&s;y and unaffected; his ideas are noble and ju&s;t, his &s;entiments amiable; and his tran&s;lator,
<PB N="7" REF="022578_0006_0FB9814CD88344C0">
animated with the &s;ame &s;pirit, and endowed with the &s;ame talents, has not only transfu&s;ed into our language the beauties of the original, but even added new ones to them.</P>
<P>THE tran&s;lator him&s;elf announces in his letter to Col. Humphreys, that he has not piqued him&s;elf upon being literal, and that he has taken &s;ome liberties in his tran&s;lation. But he is right in &s;aying that this liberty does not go &s;o far as independence: for that which he adds, is &s;o connected with the text it&s;elf, that it may be con&s;idered as a development of his author's idea; and what he retrenches (being commonly foreign to our idiom and phra&s;eology) would not have been pre&s;erved by the American author him&s;elf, if, more familiari&s;ed with our language, he had been plea&s;ed to tran&s;late his work into French. This liberty may be critici&s;ed: but we will &s;ay, in ju&s;tification of the tran&s;lator, that the author is very far from complaining of it.</P>
<P>THIS little poem is &s;carcely &s;u&s;ceptible of extracts, We will only cite the apo&s;trophe to Gen. Wa&s;hington, when he comes to take command of the American army.</P>

THE recital of the death of Brown, who peri&s;hed in an ambu&s;cade of &s;avages, of Scammel who was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated by a pi&s;tol-&s;hot in the reins, at the moment after he had &s;urrendered him&s;elf to a detachment of Engli&s;h, and that of Col.

The de&s;criptions of the author are full of ani|mation, his regrets of &s;en&s;ibility; and the tran&s;lator has not re&s;ted below his model.</P>
<P>THE reader will, moreover, remark with plea&s;ure, the contra&s;t which the author has had the art to intro|duce, in a &s;kilful manner, between the two very di&s;tinct parts of his poem. In the fir&s;t, he paints the dangers which America experienced, and the calamities of war which de&s;olated her for &s;o long a period. In the la&s;t he collects only delightful ideas and pictures of happine&s;s he unfolds to America the au&s;picious effects of that liberty &s;he had obtained, and the felicity &s;he is about to enjoy. He invites his fellow citizens, for whom the ta&s;k of glory is henceforth accompli&s;hed, to tran&s;port them&s;elves upon the borders of the lakes, and upon the fertile banks of the Belle Riviere<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The name by which the Ohio is known in French,</NOTE>, a river mo&s;t worthy of its name.

<P>IN fine, he predicts the future pro&s;perity of this na&s;|cent empire, which ri&s;es upon a plan dictated by wi&s;dom, and which will for ever remain the a&s;ylum of happine&s;s and liberty.</P>

<P>"I WAS with you, my dear Colonel, when, after a glorious campaign, you compo&s;ed in &s;ilence tho&s;e elegant ver&s;es, wherein you have di&s;played the whole extent of your genius, in only wi&s;hing to expre&s;s your patriotic &s;entiments. You made a my&s;tery of the mat|ter to me&mdash;and your mode&s;ty has expo&s;ed you to com|mit an unpardonable fault again&s;t the alliance that you have &s;o nobly celebrated; &s;ince the European nation, which has had the fir&s;t fruits of your poem, is preci&s;ely the Engli&s;h: but it is proper to acknowledge, on the pre&s;ent, as well as on many other occa&s;ions, this nation has proved that its enmity does not extend to merit and talents. All the public papers which are printed in London, have made your prai&s;es re&s;ound, and tho&s;e very papers have fir&s;t di&s;clo&s;ed your &s;ecret. It is true, I have &s;een &s;ome of them, the authors of which ap|peared to be vexed, that a compo&s;ition, in which the Engli&s;h are not treated with ceremony, &s;hould obtain the honors of public readings and public applau&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Morning Herald, and other Engli&s;h papers, made mention of the lecture of the poem in que&s;tion, made in public, apparently in clubs or other places, where people enter by ticket.</NOTE>; and who wi&s;hed to de&s;poil you of your mo&s;t illu&s;trious title, that of being an American, by making you to be born in, I known not what di&s;trict, of England. How|ever that may be, it is certain that France had rea&s;on to complain. Of no avail will it be for you to &s;ay, that your work is written in Engli&s;h; do you not know how much that language is in vogue among us, and how much we are di&s;po&s;ed to tran&s;late it?

your apartments, of a beautiful copy of your poem, printed at London with all the accuracy and magnifi|cence, which they always be&s;tow on every important work. It has, moreover, fallen to his lot to avail him|&s;elf of your ab&s;ence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This letter was addre&s;&s;ed to Col Humphreys, while he was in England.</NOTE> for making it known to his coun|trymen. For making it known! that is &s;aying too much: but at lea&s;t to give &s;ome idea to tho&s;e who are not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Engli&s;h language, to read it with facility. I have cau&s;ed the text to be printed with the tran&s;lation. This is a very generous proceeding, with which, I contend, you ought to be mightily &s;atisfied. Every reader who may be in a con|dition to compare one with the other, will often cry out: "he has not known how to render all the energy, all the beauty of the original:"&mdash;and that is exactly what I de&s;ire. There is not a pretty woman who does not pardon her painter for not making her as hand&s;ome as &s;he really is, whenever &s;he is placed by the &s;ide of her portrait; then not a compari&s;on but what proves to her advantage: and compari&s;on is of all prai&s;es the mo&s;t flattering, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t perceptible, the mo&s;t preci&s;e. My object will, therefore, be entirely completed, &s;ince all the critici&s;ms which I &s;hall merit, will turn to your glory. Being a tran&s;lator in pro&s;e, and a tran&s;lator who does not pique him&s;elf upon being literal, I &s;hould have much to fear from my author, if that author was not Colonel Humphreys, whom I wi&s;h in every point to make my model. He loves liberty too much, to be offended at what I have taken on this occa&s;ion: this liberty &s;hall not go quite to indepen|dence: this is all I promi&s;e in a&s;&s;uring him that I will always be more faithful to that friend&s;hip he has ac|corded me, than to the text of which I took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS TO THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PERHAPS the following little poem may be con&s;idered with the more indulgence by the public, after it &s;hall be known, that it was actually written, at a period</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While the American army was encamped at Peck's-kill, and the enemy occupied the heights of New-York and Charle&s;ton.</NOTE><HI>when the army was in the field, and the author &s;o far engaged in the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, as to have but little lei&s;ure for &s;ubjects of literature or amu&s;ement. And it will not be nece&s;|&s;ary to demon&s;trate to tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t knowledge of a military life, how unfavorable &s;uch a &s;tate is to poetical contemplation. This, it is pre&s;umed, may pertinently be urged in excu&s;e for the &s;lighter errors and inaccuracies of the performance: and the de&s;ign mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, alone for any of a different complexion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To in&s;pire our countrymen, now in arms, or who may, hereafter, be called into the field, with per&s;everance and for|titude, through every &s;pecies of difficulty and danger, to con|tinue their exertions for the defence of their country, and the pre&s;ervation of its liberties, is the object of this addre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="022578_0011_0FB98158D8332120">
<HI>For this purpo&s;e, it was imagined, no con&s;iderations could be more effectual, than the recollection of the pa&s;t, and the anticipation of the future. For, where is the man to be found, who, after all that has been done and &s;uffered&mdash;after &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion of blood and trea&s;ure has been expended&mdash;and &s;uch important advantages have been obtained&mdash;would ba&s;ely re|linqui&s;h and leave unfini&s;hed the illu&s;trious ta&s;k of rearing an empire, which, from its &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, mu&s;t &s;urpa&s;s all that have ever exi&s;ted, in magnitude, felicity, and duration?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Although the author entertains the mo&s;t &s;anguine expecta|tions of the gratitude and liberality, with which the continent will reward tho&s;e who have literally borne the heat and bur|den of the day of war&mdash;he has not in&s;i&s;ted on tho&s;e pecuniary or &s;lighter con&s;iderations; but has attempted to turn the at|tention to the future grandeur, happine&s;s and glory of the country for which we are now contending. The lands alrea|dy granted to the army, fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of a military &s;ettlement on the Ohio, or &s;ome of tho&s;e we&s;tern regions, who&s;e beauties can never be &s;ufficiently di&s;played, much le&s;s exag|gerated by de&s;cription. The mild temperature and &s;erenity of the air, the &s;alubrity of the climate, the fertility of the &s;oil, the luxuriance of its products, the extent of territory, and the amazing inland navigation, which tho&s;e boundle&s;s lakes and immea&s;urable rivers will open&mdash;cannot fail, one day, to render that garden of the world equal to the repre&s;entation given of it, in the conclu&s;ion of the poem. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a country, (re&s;cued from the hand of inva&s;ion) in a perfect &s;tate of freedom and &s;ecurity, will be a glorious com|pen&s;ation

for all our toils and &s;ufferings, and a monument of the mo&s;t unparalleled bravery and patrioti&s;m, to the remot|e&s;t po&s;terity. Stimulated with the love of glory, allured by the&s;e delightful pro&s;pects, and animated with the plea&s;ing hope of the &s;peedy fruition of tho&s;e rapturous &s;cenes&mdash;there are thou&s;ands who have drawn the &s;word, with a re&s;olution never to &s;heath it, until a happy period &s;hall be put to the conte&s;t. For him&s;elf, the writer declares, that having alrea|dy devoted what&s;oever talents and abilities nature has confer|red upon him, to the &s;ervice of his country&mdash;no efforts that can be made with his voice, his pen, or his &s;word, &s;hall ever be wanting to confirm its LIBERTIES and INDEPEN|DENCE.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Extract from the Columbian Magazine, for Oct. 1786. Remarks on "THE HAPPINESS OF AMERICA," a Poem.</HEAD>
<P>A LOVE of liberty, a &s;pirit of enterprize, fortitude in difficulties, and a military turn of mind, are con&s;picuous traits in the American character. Tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, if properly directed, will tend to the ag|grandizement and pro&s;perity of our infant republican empire.</P>
<P>AMERICA &s;tands high, al&s;o, in literary reputation: and &s;o great is the &s;pirit which now prevails in the United States, for the promotion of u&s;eful learning, and advancement of &s;cience, that, aided by the native geni|us of our people, we may rea&s;onably expect to arrive at the highe&s;t degree of eminence, in the&s;e re&s;pects. Nor have we cau&s;e to draw le&s;s favourable expectations, from the &s;pecimens that have been already exhibited, of the natural ta&s;te and propen&s;ity of our countrymen for the liberal and polite arts.</P>
<P>AMONG the patriots, &s;tate&s;men, heroes, philo&s;ophers, and arti&s;ts of this country, we find names that would do honour to any age or nation.&mdash;What a glorious con&s;tel|lation is formed by an a&s;&s;emblage of tho&s;e worthies, whom America has the honour of enrolling among her &s;ons!</P>
<P>AMIDST the favourite pur&s;uits of our countrymen, the mu&s;es have had their votaries;&mdash;nor have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> been un&s;ucce&s;sfully courted. Their genius &s;eems much delighted with our &s;ylvan &s;cenes. The face of nature, throughout the United States, exhibits the <HI>&s;ub|lime and beautiful,</HI> in the mo&s;t exalted degree. In al|mo&s;t every part of this country, we are &s;urrounded with
<PB N="31" REF="022578_0030_0FB9818907E729B0">
objects calculated to in&s;pire the mo&s;t elevated concep|tions of the imagination. Our mountains, vallies, plains, and rivers, are formed upon a great &s;cale; the extent of the country it&s;elf is great; and the whole is rendered magnificently beautiful, by the creating hand of the Al|mighty Architect! And, if we contemplate the emi|nently dignified part that has been recently acted on the va&s;t national &s;tage; with the &s;cenes of magnanimity, wi&s;dom, and patriotic virtue, which our gallant coun|trymen have exhibited thereon; we mu&s;t allow, that no|thing can afford more noble themes, for our native bards.</P>
<P>AMONG the literary productions of American genius, "A Poem on the Happine&s;s of America, addre&s;&s;ed to the Citizens of the United States," by Col. Humphreys claims a &s;uperior &s;tation. The beauties of this piece do great honour to the author, and di&s;cover that he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a truly patriotic &s;oul, as well as a mind animated with genuine poetic fire.</P>
<P>AS this elegant piece, by &s;ome unaccountable circum|&s;tance, has not yet made its appearance in the &s;hops of our book&s;ellers, we beg leave to pre&s;ent the public with a few quotations from it; reminding them, at the &s;ame time, of the imperfect idea of its merit, that mutilated parts of the piece mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to convey.</P>
<P>AS it is probable, that a new edition of this poem will &s;peedily be publi&s;hed, the public will then have the gratification of reading it entire.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION OF THE POEM ON THE HAPPINESS OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Poem, having pa&s;&s;ed through eight Editions in little more than four years, without having been accompanied with any introduction or preface, the writer hopes he &s;hall e&s;cape every uncandid imputa|tion, in offering with this Edition his acknowledgments for the flattering reception it has met with from the Public, together with &s;ome of the motives which origi|nally engaged him in this performance.</P>
<P>THE writer is happy, that he has cho&s;en a &s;ubject more intere&s;ting than almo&s;t any other to the feelings of his Countrymen; and that the topics introduced in its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion have not proved un&s;atisfactory to tho&s;e for who&s;e entertainment the work was de&s;igned. To the&s;e cau&s;es, rather than to its intrin&s;ic value as a compo&s;i|tion, he attributes the di&s;tingui&s;hed regard with which it has been honoured.</P>
<P>THE United States of America, when fir&s;t a&s;&s;uming the form of a nation, pre&s;ented a momentuous and aw|ful &s;pectacle to mankind. For the political welfare of the &s;pecies &s;eemed, in &s;ome &s;ort, involved in the event. The theatre was va&s;t, the plot new, the parts important, and the conduct of the action for a long time &s;o doubtful, as to produce di&s;tre&s;&s;ing apprehen&s;ions re&s;pecting its ter|mination. The Americans, who&s;e exertions and &s;uffer|ings
<PB REF="022578_0032_0FB9818DD6C7A270">
had been rewarded by the acqui&s;ition of Indepen|dence, were, however, at the end of the war, &s;urround|ed with threatening pro&s;pects. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, the writer endeavoured to &s;hew his countrymen the &s;u|perior advantages for happine&s;s which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to di&s;&s;ipate their gloomy apprehen&s;ions, by the exhibition of con&s;olatory anticipations, and to make them think fa|vourably of their own &s;ituation when compared with that of other nations. Many circum&s;tances con&s;pired to give facility to the execution of the ta&s;k he had imposed on him&s;elf. The ideas were principally &s;ugge&s;ted by the peculiarity of our condition. We began our political career, in a great mea&s;ure, free from the prejudice, and favoured with the knowledge of former ages and other nations. The amiable innocence and &s;implicity of man|ners, which re&s;ulted from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety in America, offered a curious &s;ubject for philo&s;ophical contemplation. Our minds, imperceptibly impre&s;&s;ed with the novelty, beauty or &s;ublimity of &s;urrounding objects, gave energy to the language which expre&s;&s;ed our &s;en&s;ations. While the &s;hades of changing nature, which diver&s;ified the &s;cenery through all the interme|diate &s;tages of &s;ettlement and population, from the rude grandeur of a wilderne&s;s, to the plea&s;ant land&s;capes of cultivation, afforded an exten&s;ive field for variegated de&s;cription. To an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;uch magnificent ima|ges, &s;o proper for poetry, were added a multitude of in|cidents derived from the delights of agricultural life, the ble&s;&s;ings of enlightened &s;ociety, and the progre&s;s of human improvements. The author, by thus availing him&s;elf of circum&s;tances, was enabled to gratify an ear|ly and decided propen&s;ity for contemplating the beauties
<PB REF="022578_0033_0FB9818F980C1CD8">
of creation; e&s;pecially under that point of view, in which they are mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly beneficial to his fellow men.</P>
<P>SINCE this Poem was written, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a general government, and the concurrence of fortu|nate events, &s;cenes of happine&s;s have been reali&s;ed in this country, which were con&s;idered by &s;ome altogether chi|merical. And the pro&s;pects, which are now expanding before our view, &s;eem peculiarly calculated to excite us to greater exertions, notonly for promoting the nation|al pro&s;perity, but even for producing &s;uch examples in civil policy as will tend e&s;&s;entially to the ameliora|tion of the human lot.</P>

<L>Thus long ago,</L>
<L>Ere heaving bellows learn'd to blow,</L>
<L>While organs yet were mute;</L>
<L>Timotheus with his breathing flute,</L>
<L>And &s;ounding lyre,</L>
<L>Could &s;well the &s;oul to rage, or kindle &s;oft de&s;ire.</L>
<L>But when divine Cecilia came,</L>
<L>Inventre&s;s of the vocal frame,</L>
<L>The &s;weet enthu&s;ia&s;t, from her &s;acred &s;tore,</L>
<L>Enlarg'd the former narrow bounds,</L>
<L>And added length to &s;olemn &s;ounds,</L>
<L>With nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before.</L>
<L>Let old Timotheus yield the prize,</L>
<L>Or both divide the crown;</L>
<L>He rais'd a mortal to the &s;kies,</L>
<L>She drew an angel down.</L>

<P>THE extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s with which the following Tragedy has been attended in the repre&s;entation, and the circum&s;tance of our having been jointly concerned in writing the Prologue and Epilogue, make an apology unnece&s;&s;ary for my in&s;cribing it to you. If the public, in judging my writings, has acted the part of a gene|rous patron, rather than of a rigid critic, this candid public ought to be informed how much it is owing to you, that my performances are no &s;till le&s;s worthy of its patronage. It is my boa&s;t, that we formed our ta&s;te together, and on the &s;ame models, Although you pre|ceded me &s;omewhat, in your cla&s;&s;ical &s;tudies; yet no &s;ooner had we &s;een each other at the place of our edu|cation, than (as I think I may be allowed to flatter my&s;elf) a certain &s;imilarity of genius, and congeniality of &s;oul, connected us by the ties of an undi&s;&s;oluble friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall not be accu&s;ed of having neglected real bu|&s;ine&s;s for poetical recreations. Had not the tumultu|ous &s;cenes, which commenced with the late war, &s;epa|rated our little &s;ociety, we might perhaps have inno|cently indulged our&s;elves con&s;iderably more in literary &s;peculations, than the circum&s;tances have &s;ince permit|ed. It is a con&s;olation that the occa&s;ion or tendency of our performances have conciliated the minds of our Countrymen to receive them with favour. I will not

<L>WELL, here I come&mdash;and almo&s;t out of breath,</L>

<HEAD>TO THE HONORABLE COL. JEREMIAH WADSWORTH, Pre&s;ident of the State Society of the Cincinnati in Connecticut, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNAVOIDABLE ab&s;ence will prevent me from performing the grateful ta&s;k, a&s;&s;igned me by the State Society of the Cincinnati, on the fourth day of July next. Though I cannot per&s;onally addre&s;s them, I wi&s;h to demon&s;trate by &s;ome token of affectionate re|membrance, the &s;en&s;e I entertain of the honor they have more than once conferred upon me by their &s;uffrages.</P>
<P>MEDITATING in what manner to accompli&s;h this ob|ject, it occurred to me, that an attempt to pre&s;erve the actions of General Putnam, in the archives of our State Society, would be acceptable to its members, as they had all &s;erved with great &s;atisfaction under his immedi|ate orders. An e&s;&s;ay on the life of a per&s;on &s;o elevated in military rank, and &s;o conver&s;ant in extraordinary &s;cenes, could not be de&s;titute of amu&s;ement and in&s;truc|tion, and would po&s;&s;e&s;s the advantage of pre&s;enting for imitation a re&s;pectable model of public and private vir|tues.</P>
<P>GENERAL Putnam is univer&s;ally acknowledged to have been as brave and as hone&s;t a man as ever America

produced; but the di&s;tingui&s;hing features of his character, and the particular tran&s;actions of his life are but im|perfectly known. He &s;eems to have been formed on purpo&s;e for the age in which he lived. His native cou|rage, un&s;haken integrity, and e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation as a &s;oldier, were nece&s;&s;ary in the early &s;tages of our op|po&s;ition to the de&s;igns of Great Britain, and gave un|bounded confidence to our troops in their fir&s;t conflicts in the field of battle.</P>
<P>THE inclo&s;ed manu&s;cript ju&s;tly claims indulgence, for its venial errors, as it is the fir&s;t effort in Biography, that has been made on this continent. The attempt I am con&s;cious is laudable, whatever may be the failure in point of execution.</P>
<P>I AM happy to find the Society of the Cincinnati is now generally regarded in a favorable manner. Man|kind, with fewer exceptions, are di&s;po&s;ed to do ju&s;tice to the motives on which it was founded. For our&s;elves, we can never recal to mind the occa&s;ion, without feel|ing the mo&s;t tender emotions of friend&s;hip and &s;en&s;ibili|ty. At the di&s;&s;olution of the army, when we retired to &s;eparate walks of life, from the toils of a &s;ucce&s;sful war, in which we had been a&s;&s;ociated during a very impor|tant part of our lives, the plea&s;ing idea, and the fond hope of meeting once a year, <HI>which gave birth to our fraternal in&s;titution,</HI> were nece&s;&s;ary con&s;olations to &s;oothe
<PB N="188" REF="022578_0189_0FB99D4991D03228">
the pangs, that tore our bo&s;oms at the melancholy hour of parting. When our hands touched, perhaps, for the la&s;t time, and our tongues refu&s;ed to perform their office in bidding farewel, Heaven witne&s;&s;ed and approved the purity of our intentions in the ardor of our affections. May we per&s;evere in the union of our friend&s;hip, and the exertion of our benevolence; regardle&s;s of the cen&s;ures of jealous &s;u&s;picion, which charges our de&s;igns with &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s, and in&s;cribes our actions to improper motives; while we realize &s;entiments of a nobler nature in our anniver&s;ary fe&s;tivities, and our hearts dilate with an ho|ne&s;t joy, in opening the hand of beneficence to the in|digent widow and unprotected orphan of our departed friends.</P>
<P>I PRAY you, my dear Sir, to pre&s;ent my mo&s;t re|&s;pectful compliments to the members of the Society, and to a&s;&s;ure them, on my part, that when&s;oever it &s;hall be in my power. I &s;hall e&s;teem it the felicity of my life to attend their anniv&egrave;r&s;aries.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM.</HEAD>
<P>TO treat of recent tran&s;actions and per&s;ons &s;till living, is always a delicate and frequently a thank|le&s;s office. Yet, while the partiality of friends, or the malignity of enemies, decides with ra&s;hne&s;s on every de|lineation of character, or recital of circum&s;tances, a con&s;olation remains, that di&s;tant nations and remoter ages, free from the influence of prejudice or pa&s;&s;ion, will judge with impartiality, and appreciate with ju&s;tice. We have fallen upon an aera &s;ingularly prolific in extraordi|nary per&s;onages, and dignified by &s;plendid events. Much is expected from the &s;elections of the judicious biogra|pher, as well as from the labours of the faithful hi&s;to|rian. Whatever prudential rea&s;ons may now occur to po&s;tpone the portrait of our own times, the difficulties which oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the execution, in&s;tead of being dimini&s;hed, will encrea&s;e with the lap&s;e of years. Every day will extingui&s;h &s;ome life that was dear to &s;ame, and obliterate the memorial of &s;ome deed which would have con&s;tituted the delight and admiration of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="022578_0191_0FB99D4E49DBC9D8">
So tran&s;ient and indi&s;tingui&s;hable are the traits of cha|racter, &s;o various and inexplicable the &s;prings of action, &s;o ob&s;cure and peri&s;hable the remembrance of human af|fairs, that, unle&s;s attempts are made to &s;ketch the pic|ture, while the pre&s;ent generation is living, the like|ne&s;s will be for ever lo&s;t, or only pre&s;erved by a vague recollection; di&s;gui&s;ed, perhaps, by the whim&s;ical co|lourings of a creative imagination.</P>
<P>IT will doubtle&s;s, hereafter, be an object of regret, that tho&s;e, who, having them&s;elves been con&s;picuous actors on the theatre of public life, and, who in conjunction with a knowledge of facts, po&s;&s;e&s;s abilities to paint tho&s;e characters, and de&s;cribe tho&s;e events, which (during the progre&s;s of the American Revolution) intere&s;ted and a|&s;toni&s;hed mankind, &s;hould feel an in&s;uperable reluctance to a&s;&s;ume the ta&s;k&mdash;a ta&s;k, which (if executed with fide|lity) mu&s;t, from the dignity of its &s;ubject, become grate|ful to the patriots of all nations, and profitable in ex|ample to the remote&s;t po&s;terity. Equally &s;evere will be the mortification of contemplating the reveries and fic|tions, which have been &s;ub&s;tituted by hacknied writers in the place of hi&s;torical facts. Nor &s;hould we &s;uppre&s;s our indignation again&s;t that cla&s;s of profe&s;&s;ional authors, who, placed in the vale of penury and ob&s;curity, at an immen&s;e di&s;tance from the &s;cenes of action, and all op|portunities of acquiring the nece&s;&s;ary documents, with in&s;ufferable effrontery, obtrude their fallacious and crude performances on a credulous public. Did the re&s;ult of their lucubrations terminate only in relieving their own di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or gratifying their individual vanity, it might be pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilent contempt. But the effect is exten&s;ive,

<P>ISRAEL PUTNAM, who, through a regular gradation of promotion became the &s;enior Major Gene|ral in the army of the United States, and next in rank to General Wa&s;hington, was born at Salem in the Pro|vince, now State, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, on the 7th day of January, 1718.

<P>ALTHOUGH our ance&s;tors, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this

land, amid&s;t the extreme pre&s;&s;ure of poverty and danger, early in&s;tituted &s;chools for the education of youth, de|&s;igned for the learned profe&s;&s;ions; yet it was thought &s;ufficient to in&s;truct tho&s;e de&s;tined to labor on the earth, in reading, writing, and &s;uch rudiments of arithmetic as might be requi&s;ite for keeping the accounts of their lit|tle tran&s;actions with each other. Few farmers &s;ons had more advantages, none le&s;s. In this &s;tate of mediocrity it was the lot of young Putnam to be placed. His early in&s;truction was not con&s;iderable, and the active &s;cenes of life, in which he was afterwards, engaged, prevented the opportunity of great literary improvement. His nume|rous original letters, though deficient in &s;chola&s;tic accu|racy, always di&s;play the goodne&s;s of his heart, and fre|quently the &s;trength of his native genius. He had a certain laconic mode of expre&s;&s;ion, and an unaffected epigrammatic turn, which characteri&s;ed mo&s;t of his writings.</P>

COURAGE, enterprize, activity and per&s;everance were the fir&s;t characteri&s;tics of his mind. There is a kind of mechanical courage, the offspring of pride, habit or di&s;|cipline, that may pu&s;h a coward not only to perform his duty, but even to venture on acts of heroi&s;m. Putnam's courage was of a different &s;pecies. It was ever attended with a &s;erenity of &s;oul, a clearne&s;s of conception, a de|gree of &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and a &s;uperiority to all the vici&s;&s;i|tudes of fortune, entirely di&s;tinct from any thing that can be produced by the ferment of blood, and flutter of &s;pirits; which, not unfrequently, precipitate men to ac|tion, when &s;timulated by intoxication or &s;ome other tran&s;ient exhilaration. The heroic character, thus founded on con&s;titution and animal &s;pirits, cheri&s;hed by education and ideas of per&s;onal freedom, confirmed by temperance and habits of exerci&s;e, was completed by the dictate of rea&s;on, the love of his country, and an invincible &s;en&s;e of duty. Such were the qualities and principles, that enabled him to meet unappalled the &s;hafts of adver&s;ity, and to pa&s;s in triumph through the furnace of affliction.</P>
<P>His di&s;po&s;ition was as frank and generous, as his mind was fearle&s;s and independent. He di&s;gui&s;ed no|thing; indeed he &s;eemed incapable of di&s;gui&s;e. Perhaps, in the intercour&s;e he was ultimately obliged to have with an artful world, his &s;incerity, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, outwent his di&s;cretion. Although he had too much &s;uavity in his nature to commence a quarrel, he had too much &s;en&s;ibility not to feel, and too much honor not to re&s;ent an intended in&s;ult. The fir&s;t time he went to Bo|&s;ton, he was in&s;ulted for his ru&s;ticity by a boy of twice his &s;ize and age; after bearing the &s;arca&s;ms until his
<PB N="199" REF="022578_0199_0FB998AF472BC8F0">
patience was worn out, he challenged, engaged and van|qui&s;hed his unmannerly antagoni&s;t, to the great diver|&s;ion of a crowd of &s;pectators. While a &s;tripling, his am|bition was to perform the labor of a man, and to excel in athletic diver&s;ions. In that rude, but ma&s;culine age, whenever the village-youth a&s;&s;embled on their u&s;ual occa&s;ions of fe&s;tivity; pitching the bar, running, leap|ing and wre&s;tling were favorite amu&s;ements. At &s;uch gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es (in which during the heroic times of ancient Greece and Rome, conque&s;t was con&s;idered as the promi&s;e of future military &s;ame) he bore the palm from almo&s;t every ring.</P>
<P>BEFORE the refinements of luxury, and the con&s;equent increa&s;e of expences had rendered the maintenance of a family inconvenient or burden&s;ome in America, the &s;exes entered into matrimony at an early age. Competence, attainable by all, was the limit of pur&s;uit. After the hard&s;hips of making a new &s;ettlement were overcome, and the evils of penury removed, the inhabitants enjoy|ed, in the lot of equality, innocence, and &s;ecurity, &s;cenes equally delightful with tho&s;e pictured by the glowing imagination of the poets in their favorite pa&s;toral life or fabulous golden age. Indeed the condition of man|kind was never more enviable. Neither di&s;parity of age and fortune, nor &s;chemes of ambition and grandeur, nor the pride and avarice of high-minded and mercenary pa|rents, interpo&s;ed tho&s;e ob&s;tacles to the union of congenial &s;ouls, which frequently in more poli&s;hed &s;ociety prevent, imbitter or de&s;troy all the felicity of the connubial &s;tate. Mr. Putnam before he attained the twenty-fir&s;t year of his age, married Mi&s;s Pope, daughter of Mr. John Pope
<PB N="200" REF="022578_0200_0FB998B0B39AA9B0">
of Salem, by whom he had ten children, &s;even of whom are &s;till living. He lo&s;t the wife of his youth in 1764. Some time after he married Mrs. Gardiner, widow of the late Mr. Gardiner, of Gardiner's I&s;land, by whom he had no i&s;&s;ue. She died in 1777.</P>
<P>IN the year 1739 he removed from Salem to Pom|fret, an inland fertile town in Connecticut, forty miles ea&s;t of Hartford: having here purcha&s;ed a con&s;iderable tract of land, he applied him&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully to agricul|ture.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t years, on a new farm, are not, however exempt from di&s;a&s;ters and di&s;appointments, which can only be remedied by &s;tubborn and patient indu&s;try. Our farmer, &s;ufficiently occupied in building an hou&s;e and barn, felling woods, making fences, &s;owing grain, plant|ing orchards and taking care of his &s;tock, had to encoun|ter, in turn, the calamities occa&s;ioned by drought in &s;ummer, bla&s;t in harve&s;t, lo&s;s of cattle in winter, and the de&s;olation of his &s;heep-fold by wolves. In one night he had &s;eventy fine &s;heep and goats killed, be&s;ides many lambs and kids wounded. This havoc was com|mitted by a &s;he-wolf, which, with her annual whelps, had for &s;everal years infe&s;ted the vicinity. The young were commonly de&s;troyed by the vigilance of the hunt|ers, but the old one was too &s;agacious to come within reach of gun-&s;hot: upon being clo&s;ely pur&s;ued &s;he would generally fly to the we&s;tern woods, and return the next winter with another litter of whelps.</P>
<P>THIS wolf, at length, became &s;uch an intolerable
<PB N="201" REF="022578_0201_0FB998BB68B31CF8">
nui&s;ance, that Mr. Putnam entered into a combination with five of his neighbors to hunt alternately until they could de&s;troy her. Two, by rotation, were to be con|&s;tantly in pur&s;uit. It was known, that, having lo&s;t the toes from one foot, by a &s;teel-trap, &s;he made one track &s;horter than the other. By this ve&s;tige, the pur&s;uers recognized, in a light &s;now, the route of this pernicious animal. Having followed her to Connecticut river, and found &s;he had turned back in a direct cour&s;e towards Pomfret, they immediately returned, and by ten o'clock the next morning, the blood-hounds had driven her in|to a den, about three miles di&s;tant from the hou&s;e of Mr. Putnam: The people &s;oon collected with dogs, guns, &s;traw, fire, and &s;ulphur, to attack the common enemy. With this apparatus &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts were made to force her from the den. The hounds came back badly wounded and refu&s;ed to return. The &s;moke of blazing &s;traw had no effect. Nor did the fumes of burnt brim&s;tone, with which the cavern was filled, com|pel her to quit the retirement. Wearied with &s;uch fruit|le&s;s attempts (which had brought the time to ten o'clock at night) Mr. Putnam tried once more to make his dog enter, but in vain. He propo&s;ed to his negro man to go down into the cavern and &s;hoot the wolf: the negro de|clined the hazardous &s;ervice. Then it was, that their ma&s;ter, angry at the di&s;appointment, and declaring that he was a&s;hamed to have a coward in his family, re&s;olved him&s;elf to de&s;troy the ferocious bea&s;t, left &s;he &s;hould e&s;cape through &s;ome unknown fi&s;&s;ure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rock. His neighbours &s;trongly remon&s;trated again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> en|terprize: but he knowing, that wild animal were in|timidated by fire, and having provided &s;everal &s;trips of

birch-bark, the only combu&s;tible material which he could obtain, that would afford light in this deep and dark&s;ome cave, prepared for his de&s;cent. Having, ac|cordingly, dive&s;ted him&s;elf of his coat and wai&s;tcoat, and having a long rope fa&s;tened round his legs, by which he might be pulled back, at a concerted &s;ignal, he entered head foremo&s;t, with the blazing torch in his hand.</P>
<P>THE aperture of the den, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of a very high ledge of rocks, is about two feet &s;quare; from thence it de&s;cends obliquely fifteen feet, then running horizontally about ten more, it a&s;cends gradually &s;ixteen feet towards its termination. The &s;ides of this &s;ubter|raneous cavity are compo&s;ed of &s;mooth and &s;olid rocks, which &s;eem to have been divided from each other by &s;ome former earthquake. The top and bottom are al&s;o of &s;tone, and the entrance, in winter, being covered with ice, is exceedingly &s;lippery. It is in no place high enough for a man to rai&s;e him&s;elf upright: nor in any part more than three feet in width.</P>
<P>HAVING groped his pa&s;&s;age to the horizontal part of the den, the mo&s;t terrifying darkne&s;s appeared in front of the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. It was &s;ilent as the hou&s;e of death. None but mon&s;ters of the de&s;ert had ever before explored this &s;olitary man&s;ion of horror. He, cautiou&s;ly proceeding onward, came to the a&s;cent, which he &s;lowly mounted on his hands and knees, until he di&s;covered the glaring eye-balls of the wolf, who was &s;itting at the extremity of the cavern. Started at the &s;ight of fire, &s;he gna&s;hed her teeth and gave a &s;ul|len growl. As &s;oon as he had made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;|covery,
<PB N="203" REF="022578_0203_0FB998BEFAC25FA8">
he kicked the rope as a &s;ignal for pulling him out. The people at the mouth of the den, who had li&s;tened with painful anxiety, hearing the growling of the wolf and &s;uppo&s;ing their friend to be in the mo&s;t im|minent danger, drew him forth with &s;uch celerity that his &s;hirt was &s;tripped over his head and his &s;kin &s;everely lacerated. After he had adju&s;ted his clothes and loaded his gun with nine buck-&s;hot, holding a torch in one hand and the mu&s;quet in the other, he de&s;cended the &s;e|cond time. When he drew nearer than before, the wolf, a&s;&s;uming a &s;till more fierce and terrible appear|ance, howling, rolling her eyes, &s;napping her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, was evidently in the attitude and on the point of &s;pringing at him. At the critical in&s;tant, he levelled and fired at her head. Stunned with the &s;hock, and &s;uffocated with the &s;moke, he immediately found him&s;elf drawn out of the cave. But having refre&s;hed him&s;elf, and permitted the &s;moke to di&s;&s;ipate, he went down the third time. Once more he came within &s;ight of the wolf, who appearing very pa&s;&s;ive, he applied the torch to her no&s;e; and per|ceiving her dead, he took hold of her ears, and then kicking the rope (&s;till tied round his legs) the people above, with no &s;mall exultation, dragged them both out together.</P>
<P>I HAVE offered the&s;e facts in greater detail, becau&s;e they contain a di&s;play of character; and becau&s;e they have been erroneou&s;ly related in &s;everal European pub|lications, and very much mutilated in the hi&s;tory of Con|necticut, a work as replete with fal&s;ehood as de&s;titute of genius, lately printed in London.</P>

PROSPERITY, at length, began to attend the agricul|tural affairs of Mr. Putnam. He was acknowledged to be a &s;kilful and indefatigable manager. His fields were mo&s;tly enclo&s;ed with &s;tone walls. His crops commonly &s;ucceeded, becau&s;e the land was well tilled and manured. His pa&s;tures and meadows became luxuriant. His cat|tle were of the be&s;t breed and in good order. His gar|den and fruit-trees prolific. With the avails of the &s;ur|plu&s;age of his produce, foreign articles were purcha&s;ed. Within doors he found the compen&s;ation of his labors in the plenty of excellent provi&s;ions, as well as in the happine&s;s of dome&s;tic &s;ociety.</P>
<P>A MORE particular de&s;cription of his tran&s;ition from narrow to ea&s;y circum&s;tances might be given; but the mind that &s;hall have acquired an idea of the habits of labor and &s;implicity, to which the indu&s;trious coloni&s;ts were accu&s;tomed, will readily &s;upply the omi&s;&s;ion. The effect of this gradual acqui&s;ition of property, ge|nerally favorable to individual virtue and public felici|ty, &s;hould not however be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence. If there is &s;omething fa&s;cinating in the charms of a country life, from the contemplation of beautiful land&s;capes; there is likewi&s;e &s;omething elevating to the &s;oul, in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being lord of the &s;oil, and having the pow|er of creating them. The man can &s;carcely be guilty of a &s;ordid action, or even de&s;cend to an ungenerous thought, who, removed from the apprehen&s;ion of want, &s;ees his farm daily meliorating and a&s;&s;uming whatever appear|ance he plea&s;es to pre&s;cribe. This &s;ituation converts the farmer into a &s;pecies of rural philo&s;opher, by in&s;piring an hone&s;t pride in his rank as a freeman, flattering the
<PB N="205" REF="022578_0205_0FB998C579D7E450">
natural propen&s;ity for per&s;onal independence, and nou|ri&s;hing an unlimited ho&s;pitality and philanthropy in his &s;ocial character.</P>
<P>BUT the time had now arrived, which was to turn the in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry into weapons of ho&s;tility, and to exchange the hunting of wolves, who had ravaged the &s;heep folds, for the pur&s;uit after Savages who had de&s;o|lated the frontiers. Mr. Putnam was about 37 years old, when the war between England and France, which preceded the la&s;t, broke out in America. His reputa|tion mu&s;t have been favorably known to the govern|ment, &s;ince among the fir&s;t troops that were levied by Connecticut, in 1755, he was appointed to the command of a company in Lyman's regiment of Provincials. I have mentioned his age at this period expre&s;sly to obvi|ate a prevalent opinion, that he was far advanced in life when he commenced his military &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As he was extremely popular, he &s;ound no difficulty in enli&s;ting his complement of recruits from the mo&s;t hardy, enterprizing, and re&s;pectable young men of his neighborhood. The regiment joined the army, at the opening of the campaign, not far di&s;tant from Crown|Point. Soon after his arrival at camp, he became ac|quainted with the famous partizan Captain, afterwards, Major Rogers; with whom he was frequently a&s;&s;ociated in traver&s;ing the wilderne&s;s, reconnoitring the enemy's lines, gaining intelligence, and taking &s;traggling pri&s;on|ers; as well as in beating up the quarters and &s;urpri&s;ing the advanced pickets of their army. For the&s;e opera|tions a corps of rangers, was formed from the irregulars.
<PB N="206" REF="022578_0206_0FB998CB8F5CE068">
The fir&s;t time Rogers and Putnam were detached with a party of the&s;e light troops, it was the fortune of the latter to pre&s;erve, with his own hand, the life of the former, and to cement their friend&s;hip with the blood of one of their enemies.</P>
<P>THE object of this expedition was to obtain an accurate knowledge of the po&s;ition and &s;tate of the works at Crown Point. It was impracticable to approach with their party near enough for this purpo&s;e, without being di&s;covered. Alone, the undertaking was &s;ufficiently hazardous on account of the &s;warms of ho&s;tile Indians, who infe&s;ted the woods. Our two partizans, however, left all their men at a convenient di&s;tance, with &s;trict orders to continue concealed until their return. Hav|ing thus cautiou&s;ly taken their arrangements, they ad|vanced with the profounde&s;t &s;ilence in the evening; and lay, during the night, contiguous to the fortre&s;s. Early in the morning, they approached &s;o clo&s;e as to be able to give &s;atisfactory information to the general who had &s;ent them, on the &s;everal points to which their at|tention had been directed: but Capt. Rogers, being at a little di&s;tance from Capt. Putnam, fortuitou&s;ly met a &s;tout Frenchman, who in&s;tantly &s;eized his fuzee with one hand, and with the other attempted to &s;tab him, while he called to an adjacent guard for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The guard an&s;wered. Putnam, perceiving the imminent danger of his friend, and that no time was to be lo&s;t, or farther alarm given by firing, ran rapidly to them, while they were yet &s;truggling, and with the but-end of his piece laid the Frenchman dead at his feet. The partizans, to elude pur&s;uit, precipitated their flight,
<PB N="207" REF="022578_0207_0FB998D038CE8E88">
joined the party, and returned without lo&s;s to the en|campment. Not many occa&s;ions occurred for partizans to di&s;play their talents in the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer.&mdash;The war was chequered with various fortune in differ|ent quarters&mdash;&s;uch as the total defeat of General Brad|dock, and the &s;plendid victory of Sir William John&s;on over the French troops commanded by the Baron Die&s;|kau. The brilliancy of this &s;ucce&s;s was nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ole the Americans for the di&s;grace of that di&s;a&s;ter. Here I might, indeed, take a pride in contra&s;ting the conduct of the Briti&s;h Regulars, who had been ambu|&s;caded on the Monongahela, with that of the Provinci|als (under John&s;on) who, having been attacked in their lines, gallantly repul&s;ed the enemy and took their Ge|neral pri&s;oner, did I con&s;ider my&s;elf at liberty to &s;well this e&s;&s;ay with reflections on events, in which Putnam was not directly concerned. The time for which the colonial troops engaged to &s;erve, terminated with the campaign. Putnam was re-appointed, and again took the field in 1756.</P>
<P>FEW are &s;o ignorant of war as not to know, that mi|litary adventures, in the night, are always extremely liable to accidents. Captain Putnam, having been com|manded to reconnoitre the enemy's camp at <HI>the Ovens,</HI> near <HI>Ticonderoga,</HI> took the brave Lieutenant Robert Durkee as his companion. In attempting to execute the&s;e orders, he narrowly mi&s;&s;ed being taken him&s;elf in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and killing his friend in the &s;econd. It was cu&s;tomary for the Briti&s;h and Provincial troops to place their fires round their camp, which frequently expo&s;ed them to the enemy's &s;couts and patroles. A
<PB N="208" REF="022578_0208_0FB998D1B6872EC8">
contrary practice, then unknown in the Engli&s;h army, prevailed among the French and Indians. The plan was much more rational; they kept their fires in the centre, lodged their men circularly at a di&s;tance, and po&s;ted their centinels in the &s;urrounding darkne&s;s. Our partizans approached the camp&mdash;and &s;uppo&s;ing the centries were within the circle of fires, crept upon their hands and knees with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible caution, until, to their utter a&s;toni&s;hment, they found them&s;elves in the thick|e&s;t of the enemy. The centinels, di&s;covering them, fired and &s;lightly wounded Durkee in the thigh. He and Put|nam had no alternative. They fled. The latter, being foremo&s;t and &s;carcely able to &s;ee his hand before him, &s;oon plunged into a clay-pit. Durkee, almo&s;t at the identical moment, came tumbling after. Putnam, by no means plea&s;ed at finding a companion, and believing him to be one of the enemy&punc; lifted his tomahawk to give the deadly blow&mdash;when Durkee, (who had follow|ed &s;o clo&s;ely as to know him) enquired whether he had e&s;caped unhurt. Captain Putnam, in&s;tantly recognizing the voice, dropped his weapon: and both, &s;pringing from the pit, made good their retreat to the neighbour|ing ledges, amid&s;t a &s;hower of random &s;hot. There they betook them&s;elves to a large log, by the &s;ide of which they lodged the remainder of the night. Before they lay down. Captain Putnam &s;aid he had a little rum in his canteen, which could never be more acceptable or nece&s;&s;ary; but on examining the canteen, which hung under his arm, he &s;ound the enemy had pierced it with their balls, and that there was not a drop of liquor left. The next day he &s;ound fourteen bullet holes in his blanket.</P>

IN the &s;ame &s;ummer a body of the enemy, con&s;i&s;ting of 600 men, attacked the baggage and provi&s;ion wag|gons at a place called the Half-way Brook; it being e|quidi&s;tant from Fort Edward, and the &s;outh end of lake George. Having killed the oxen and plundered the waggons, they retreated with their booty without hav|ing met with &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance as might have been expect|ed from the &s;trength of the e&s;cort. General Webb, up|on receiving intelligence of this di&s;a&s;ter, ordered the Captains Putnam and Rogers <Q>to take 100 volunteers in boats, with two wall-pieces and two blunderbu&s;&s;es, and to proceed down lake George to a certain point: there to leave the batteaux under a proper guard, and thence to cro&s;s by land &s;o as to harra&s;s, and if practicable, intercept the retreating enemy at the narrows.</Q> The&s;e orders were executed with &s;o much punctuality, that the party arrived at the de&s;tined place half an hour before the ho&s;tile boats came in view. Here they waited, under cover, until the enemy (igno|rant of the&s;e proceedings) entered the narrows with their batteaux loaded with plunder. Then the volunteers pour|ed upon them volley after volley, killed many of the oar&s;men, &s;unk a number of the batteaux, and would &s;oon have de&s;troyed the whole body of the enemy, had not the unu&s;ual precipitancy of their pa&s;&s;age (favored by the wind) carried them through the narrows into the wide part of South-Bay; where they were out of the reach of mu&s;quet &s;hot. The &s;hattered remnant of the little fleet &s;oon arrived at Ticonderoga and gave in|formation that Putnam and Rogers were at the narrows. A fre&s;h party was in&s;tantly detached to cut them in pieces, on their return to Fort Edward. Our partizans,

&s;en&s;ible of the probability of &s;uch an attempt, and being full twenty miles from their boats, &s;trained every nerve to reach them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; which they effected the &s;ame night. Next day, when they had returned as far as Sabbath-day-Point, they di&s;covered, on &s;hore, the before-mentioned detachment of 300 men, who had pa&s;|&s;ed them in the night, and who now, on perceiving our party, took to their boats with the greate&s;t alacrity, and rowed out to give battle. They advanced in line, main|taining a good mein and felicitating them&s;elves upon the pro&s;pect of an ea&s;y conque&s;t, from the great &s;uperi|ority of their numbers. Flu&s;hed with the&s;e expecta|tions, they were permitted to come within pi&s;tol-&s;hot be|fore a gun was fired. At once, the wall-pieces and blunderbu&s;&s;es, which had been brought to take them in the mo&s;t vulnerable point, were di&s;charged. As no &s;uch reception had been fore&s;een, the a&s;&s;ailants were thrown into the utmo&s;t di&s;order. Their terror and confu&s;ion were greatly encrea&s;ed by a well-directed and mo&s;t de|&s;tructive fire of the &s;mall arms. The larger pieces be|ing re-loaded, without annoyance, continued alternately, with the mu&s;quetry, to make dreadful havoc, until the route was completed and the enemy driven back to Ti|conderoga. In this action, one of the bark canoes con|tained twenty Indians, of whom fifteen were killed. Great numbers, from other boats, both of French and Indians were &s;een to fall overboard: but the account of their total lo&s;s could never be a&s;certained. Rogers and Putnam had but one man killed and two &s;lightly wound|ed. They now landed on the Point, and having refre&s;h|ed their men at lei&s;ure, returned in good order to the Briti&s;h camp.</P>

SOON after the&s;e rencounters, a &s;ingular kind of race was run by our nimble-footed Provincial and an active young Frenchman. The liberty of each was by turns at &s;take. General Webb, wanting a pri&s;oner for the &s;ake of intelligence, &s;ent Captain Putnam with five men to procure one. The Captain concealed him&s;elf near the road which leads from Ticonderoga to the Ovens. His men &s;eemed fond of &s;hewing them&s;elves, which un&s;oldi|erlike conduct he prohibited with the &s;evere&s;t reprehen|&s;ion. This rebuke they imputed to unnece&s;&s;ary fear. The ob&s;ervation is as true as vulgar, that per&s;ons, di&s;|tingui&s;hable for temerity, when there is no apparent danger, are generally poltroons whenever danger ap|proaches. They had not lain long, in the high gra&s;s, before a Frenchman and an Indian pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;the Indian was con&s;iderably in advance. As &s;oon as the former had gone by, Putnam, relying on the fidelity of his men, &s;prang up, ran and ordered them to follow. After run|ning about thirty rods, he &s;eized the Frenchman by the &s;houlders and forced him to &s;urrender: But his pri&s;on|er, looking round, perceiving no other enemy, and know|ing the Indian would be ready in a moment to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, began to make an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance. Putnam, finding him&s;elf betrayed by his men into a perilous dilemma, let go his hold, &s;tepped back and &s;napped his piece, which was levelled at the Frenchman's brea&s;t. It mi&s;&s;ed fire. Upon this, he thought it mo&s;t prudent to retreat. The Frenchman, in turn, chaced him back to his men, who, at la&s;t rai&s;ed them&s;elves from the gra&s;s; which his pur&s;uer, e&s;pying in good time for him&s;elf, made his e&s;cape. Putnam, mortified that the&s;e men had fru&s;trat|ed his &s;ucce&s;s, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with di&s;grace; and, not

long after accompli&s;hed his object. Such little feats, as the capture of a &s;ingle pri&s;oner, may be of infinitely more con&s;equence than &s;ome, who are unacquainted with military affairs, would be apt to imagine. In a country covered with woods, like that part of America, then the &s;eat of war, the difficulty of procuring, and the importance of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing good intelligence, can &s;carcely be conceived even by European commanders. They, however, who know its value, will not appreciate lightly the &s;ervices of an able partizan.</P>
<P>NOTHING, worthy of remark, happened during this campaign except the lo&s;s of O&s;wego. That &s;ort, which had been built by General Shirley to protect the peltry trade, cover the country on the Mohawk-River, and fa|cilitate an inva&s;ion of Canada by Frontenac and Niagara, fell into the hands of the enemy, with a garri&s;on of &s;ix|teen hundred men and one hundred pieces of cannon.</P>
<P>THE active &s;ervices of Captain Putnam, on every oc|ca&s;ion, attracted the admiration of the public, and indu|ced the Legi&s;lature of Connecticut to promote him to a majority in 1757.</P>
<P>LORD Loudon was then Commander in Chief of the Briti&s;h forces in America. The expedition again&s;t Crown Point, which, from the commencement of ho&s;tilities, had been in contemplation, &s;eemed to give place to a more important operation that was meditated again&s;t Loui&s;|bourg. But the arrival of the Bre&s;t &s;quadron at that place prevented the attempt; and the lo&s;s of Fort Wil|liam-Henry &s;erved to cla&s;s this with the two former un|&s;ucce&s;sful
<PB N="213" REF="022578_0213_0FB998EE29CF1060"> campaigns. It was rumored and partially credited at the time, that General Webb, who com|manded in the northern department, had early intima|tion of the movement of the French army, and might have effectually &s;uccored garri&s;on. The &s;ub&s;equent facts will place the affair in its proper light.</P>
<P>A FEW days before the &s;iege, Major Putnam, with two hundred men, e&s;corted General Webb from Fort Edward to Fort William-Henry. The object was to examine the &s;tate of this fortification, which &s;tood at the &s;outhern extremity of Lake George. Several abortive attempts having been made by Major Rogers and others in the night &s;ea&s;on. Major Putnam propo&s;ed to go down the lake in open day-light, land at Northwe&s;t-Bay and tarry on &s;hore, until he could make &s;atisfactory di&s;co|very of the enemy's actual &s;ituation at Ticonderoga and the adjacent po&s;ts. The plan (which he &s;ugge&s;ted) of landing with only five men and &s;ending back the boats, to prevent detection, was deemed too hazardous by the General. At length, however, he was permitted to proceed with eighteen volunteers in three whale-boats: but before he arrived at Northwe&s;t-Bay he di&s;covered a body of men on an i&s;land. Immediately upon this, he left two boats to fi&s;h at a di&s;tance, that they might not occa&s;ion an alarm, and returned him&s;elf with the infor|mation. The General, &s;eeing him rowing back with great velocity, in a &s;ingle boat, concluded the others were captured, and &s;ent a &s;kiff with orders for him alone to come on &s;hore. After advi&s;ing the General of the circum&s;tances, he urged the expediency of returning to make further di&s;coveries, and bring off the boats. Leave

was reluctantly given. He found his people, and, pa&s;|&s;ing &s;till onward, di&s;covered (by the aid of a good per|&s;pective gla&s;s) a large army in motion. By this time &s;everal of the advanced canoes had nearly &s;urrounded him, but, by the &s;wiftne&s;s of his whale-boats, he e&s;cap|ed through the mid&s;t of them. On his return, he in|formed the General minutely of all he had &s;een, and intimated his conviction that the expedition mu&s;t obvi|ou&s;ly be de&s;tined again&s;t Fort William-Henry. That Commander, &s;trictly enjoining &s;ilence on the &s;ubject, di|rected him to put his men under an oath of &s;ecrecy, and to prepare, without lo&s;s of time, to return to the Head Quarters of the Army. Major Putnam ob&s;erved <Q>he hoped his Excellency did not intend to neglect &s;o fair an opportunity of giving battle, &s;hould the enemy pre|&s;ume to land.</Q>&mdash;<Q>What do you think we &s;hould do here,</Q> replied the General. Accordingly, the next day he returned, and the day after Colonel Monro was ordered from Fort Edward, with his regiment, to rein|force the garri&s;on. That officer took with him all his rich baggage and camp equipage, notwith&s;tanding Major Putnam's advice to the contrary. The day following his arrival, the enemy landed and be&s;ieged the place.</P>
<P>THE Marquis de Montealm, Commander in chief for the French in Canada (intending to take advantage of the ab&s;ence of a large proportion of the Briti&s;h force, which he under&s;tood to be employed under Lord Lou|don again&s;t Loui&s;bourg) had a&s;&s;embled whatever men could be &s;pared from Ticonderoga, Crown Point and the other garri&s;ons; with the&s;e he had combined a con&s;i|derable corps of Canadians and a larger body of Indians
<PB N="215" REF="022578_0215_0FB998F091AAC420">
than had ever before been collected: making in the whole an army of nearly eight thou&s;and men. Our gar|ri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-five hundred and was com|manded by Colonel Monro, a very gallant officer; who found the means of &s;ending expre&s;s after expre&s;s to Ge|neral Webb, with an account of his &s;ituation and the mo&s;t pre&s;ling &s;olicitation for &s;uccour. In the mean time, the army at Fort Edward, which originally amounted to about four thou&s;and, had been con&s;iderably augmented by John&s;on's troops and the militia. On the 8th or 9th day after the landing of the French, General John&s;on (in con&s;equence of repeated applications) was &s;uffered to march for the relief of the garri&s;on, with all the Pro|vincials, Militia and Putnam's Rangers: but before they had proceeded three miles, the order was countermanded, and they returned. M. de Montealm informed Major Putnam, when a pri&s;oner in Canada, that one of his run|ning Indians &s;aw and reported this movement; and, upon being que&s;tioned relatively to the numbers, an|&s;wered in their figurative &s;tyle, <HI>"If you can count the leaves on the trees, you can count them."</HI> In effect, the operations of the &s;iege was &s;u&s;pended, and preparations made for re-embarking, when another of the runners reported that the detachment had gone back. The Mar|quis de Montcalm, provided with a good train of artillery, meeting with no annoyance from the Briti&s;h army, and but incon&s;iderable interruption from the garri&s;on, acce|lerated his approaches &s;o rapidly, as to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fort, in a &s;hort time after completing the inve&s;ti|ture. An intercepted letter from General Webb, ad|vi&s;ing the &s;urrender, was &s;ent into the Fort to Colonel Monro by the French General.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="022578_0216_0FB998F49864B488">
THE garri&s;on engaged not to &s;erve for eighteen months, and were permitted to march out with the honors of war. But the &s;avages regarded not the capitulation, nor could they be re&s;trained, by the utmo&s;t exertion of the Commanding Officer, from committing the mo&s;t outrageous acts of cruelty. They &s;tripped and plunder|ed all the pri&s;oners, and murdered great numbers in cold blood. Tho&s;e, who e&s;caped by flight, or the pro|tection of the French, arrived in a forlorn condition at Fort Edward: Among the&s;e was the Commandant of the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>THE day &s;ucceeding this deplorable &s;cene of carnage and barbarity, Major Putnam having been di&s;patched with his Rangers, to watch the motions of the enemy, came to the &s;hore, when their rear was &s;carcely beyond the reach of mu&s;quet &s;hot. They had carried off all the cannon, &s;tores and water-craft. The Fort was demoli&s;h|ed. The barracks, the out-hou&s;es and &s;uttlers booths were heaps of ruins. The fires, not yet extinct, and the &s;moke, offen&s;ive from the mucilaginous nature of the fuel, but illy concealed innumerable fragments of human &s;kulls and bones, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances carca&s;es half con&s;umed. Dead bodies, weltering in blood, were every where to be &s;een, violated with all the wanton mutilations of &s;avage ingenuity. More than one hun|dred women, &s;ome with their brains &s;till oozing from the battered heads, others with their whole hair wrench|ed collectively with the &s;kin from the bloody &s;kulls, and many (with their throats cut) mo&s;t inhumanly &s;tabbed and butchered, lay &s;tripped entirely naked, with their bowels torn out, and afforded a &s;pectacle too horrible for de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="022578_0217_0FB998F881CA2528">
NOT long after this misfortune, General Lyman &s;uc|ceeded to the command of Fort Edward. He re&s;olved to &s;trengthen it. For this purpo&s;e one hundred and fifty men were employed in cutting timber. To cover them, Captain Little was po&s;ted (with fifty Briti&s;h Regulars) at the head of a thick &s;wamp about one hundred rods ea&s;tward of the Fort&mdash;to which his communication lay over a tongue of land, formed on the one &s;ide by the &s;wamp, and by a creek on the other.</P>
<P>ONE morning, at day break, a centinel &s;aw indi&s;|tinctly &s;everal birds, as he conceived, come from the &s;wamp and fly over him, with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s. While he was ruminating on the&s;e wonderful birds, and endeavouring to form &s;ome idea of their colour, &s;hape and &s;ize, an arrow buried it&s;elf in the limb of a tree ju&s;t above his head. He now di&s;covered the quality, and de&s;ign of the&s;e winged me&s;&s;engers of fate, and gave the alarm. In&s;tantly the working party began to retreat along the de&s;ile. A large body of Savages, had con|cealed them&s;elves in the mora&s;s before the guard was po&s;ted, and were attempting in this way to kill the centinel without noi&s;e, with de&s;ign to &s;urprize the whole party. Finding the alarm given, they ru&s;hed from the covert, &s;hot and tomahawked tho&s;e who were neare&s;t at hand, and pre&s;&s;ed hard on the remainder of the unarmed fugi|tives. Captain Little flew to their relief, and, by pour|ing on the Indians a well-timed fire, checked the pur&s;uit, and enabled &s;uch of the fatigue-men as did not fall in the fir&s;t on&s;et, to retire to the fort. Thither he &s;ent for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his little party being almo&s;t over-powered by numbers. But the Commandant, imagining that the
<PB N="218" REF="022578_0218_0FB99906C12A3F90">
main body of the enemy were approaching for a gene|ral a&s;&s;ault, called in his out-po&s;ts and &s;hut the gates.</P>
<P>MAJOR Putnam lay, with his Rangers, on an I&s;land adjacent to the fort. Having heard the mu&s;quetry and learned that his friend Captain Little was in the utmo&s;t peril, he plunged into the river at the head of his corps, and waded through the water towards the place of en|gagement. This brought him &s;o near to the fort, that General Lyman, apprized of his de&s;ign, and unwilling that the lives of a few more brave men &s;hould be ex|po&s;ed to what he deemed inevitable de&s;truction, mount|ed the parapet and ordered him to proceed no farther. The Major only took time to make the be&s;t &s;hort apology he could, and marched on. This is the only in&s;tance in the whole cour&s;e of his military &s;ervice, wherein he did not pay the &s;tricte&s;t obedience to orders; and in this in&s;tance, his motive was highly commendable. But when &s;uch conduct, even if &s;anctified by &s;ucce&s;s, is pa&s;&s;|ed over with impunity, it demon&s;trates that all is not right in the military &s;y&s;tem. In a di&s;ciplined army, &s;uch as that of the United States became under General Wa&s;hington, an officer, guilty of a &s;lighter violation of orders, however elevated in rank or meritorious in &s;er|vice, would have been brought before the bar of a Court Martial. Were it not for the &s;eductive tenden|cy of a brave man's example, I might have been &s;pared the mortification of making the&s;e remarks on the con|duct of an officer, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics were promptitude for duty and love of &s;ubordination, as well as cheerfulne&s;s to encounter every &s;pecies of diffi|culty and danger.</P>

THE Rangers of Putnam &s;oon opened their way for a junction with the little handful of Regulars, who &s;till ob&s;tinately maintained their ground. By his advice, the whole ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly with &s;houts and huzzas into the &s;wamp. The Savages fled on every &s;ide, and were chaced, with no incon&s;iderable lo&s;s on their part, as long as the day-light la&s;ted. On ours only one man was killed in the pur&s;uit. His death was immediately re|venged by that of the Indian who &s;hot him. This In|dian was one of the runners&mdash;a cho&s;en body of active young men, who are made u&s;e of not only to procure intelligence and convey tidings, but al&s;o to guard the rear on a retreat.</P>
<P>HERE it will not be un&s;ea&s;onable to mention &s;ome of the cu&s;toms in war, peculiar to the aborigines, which, on the pre&s;ent as well as other occa&s;ions, they put in practice. Whenever a retreating, e&s;pecially, a flying party had gained the &s;ummit of a ri&s;ing ground; they &s;ecreted one or two runners behind trees, cop&s;es or bu&s;h|es to fire at the enemy upon their a&s;cending the hill. This commonly occa&s;ioned the enemy to halt and form for battle. In the interim the runners u&s;ed &s;uch dexterity as to be rarely di&s;covered, or if di&s;covered, they vani&s;hed behind the height and rejoined their brother-war|riors, who having thus &s;tolen a di&s;tance, were oftentimes &s;een by their pur&s;uers no more. Or if the pur&s;uers were too eager, they &s;eldom failed to atone for their ra&s;h|ne&s;s by falling into an abu&s;cade. The Mohawks, who were afterwards much employed in &s;couts under the or|ders of Major Putnam, and who were perfectly ver&s;ed in all the wiles and &s;tratagems of their countrymen, &s;hew|ed
<PB N="220" REF="022578_0220_0FB99909B0E66AD8">
him the mode of avoiding the evils of either alterna|tive. In &s;u&s;picious thickets, and at the borders of every con&s;iderable eminence, a momentary pau&s;e was made, while they, in different parts, penetrated or a&s;cended with a cautiou&s;ne&s;s that cannot be ea&s;ily de&s;cribed. They &s;eemed all eye and ear. When they found no lurking mi&s;chief, they would beckon with the hand and pro|nounce the word, "OWISH," with a long labial hi&s;&s;ing, the <HI>O</HI> being almo&s;t quie&s;cent. This was ever the watch-word for the main body to advance.</P>
<P>INDIANS, who went to war together, and who, for any rea&s;on found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eparate into different routes, always left two or three runners at the place of &s;epara|tion, to give timely notice to either party in ca&s;e of pur|&s;uit.</P>
<P>IF a warrior chanced to &s;traggle and lo&s;e him&s;elf in the woods, or be retarded by accident or wound; the party mi&s;&s;ing him, would frequently, on their march, break down a bu&s;h or a &s;hrub and leave the top pointing in the direction they had gone, that the &s;traggler, when he &s;hould behold it, might &s;hape his cour&s;e accord|ingly.</P>
<P>WE come to the campaign when General Abercrom|bie took the command at Fort Edward. That General ordered Major Putnam, with &s;ixty men, to proceed by land to South-Bay on Lake George, for the purpo&s;e of making di&s;coveries and intercepting the enemy's parties. The latter, in compliance with the&s;e orders, po&s;ted him|&s;elf at Wood-Creek, near its entrance into South Bay.
<PB N="221" REF="022578_0221_0FB9990AB64251E0">
On this bank, which forms a jutting precipice ten or twelve feet above the water, he erected a &s;tone parapet thirty feet in length; and ma&s;ked it with young pine-trees, cut at a di&s;tance, and &s;o artfully planted as to imitate the natural growth. From hence he &s;ent back fifteen of his men, who had fallen &s;ick. Di&s;tre&s;s for want of provi|&s;ions, occa&s;ioned by the length of march and time &s;pent on this temporary fortification, compelled him to devi|ate from a rule he had e&s;tabli&s;hed, never to permit a gun to be fired but at an enemy, while on a &s;cout. He was now obliged him&s;elf to &s;hoot a buck, which had jumped into the Creek, in order to eke out their &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ance until the fourth day after the completion of the works. About ten o'clock that evening, one of the men on duty at the margin of the Bay informed him, that a fleet of bark canoes, filled with men, was &s;teering to|wards the mouth of the creek. He immediately called in all his centinels and ordered every man to his po&s;t. A profound &s;tillne&s;s reigned in the atmo&s;phere, and the full moon &s;hone with uncommon brightne&s;s. The creek, which the enemy entered, is about &s;ix rods wide, and the bank oppo&s;ite to the parapet above twenty feet high. It was intended to permit the canoes in front to pa&s;s&mdash;they had accordingly ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, when a &s;oldier acci|dentally &s;truck his firelock again&s;t a &s;tone. The com|manding officer in the van canoe heard the noi&s;e and repeated &s;everal times the Savage watch-word OWISH! In&s;tantly the canoes huddled together, with their centre preci&s;ely in front of the works, covering the creek, for a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, above and below. The officers appeared to be in deep con&s;ultation and the fleet on the point of returning; when Major Putnam,
<PB N="222" REF="022578_0222_0FB9991536028DA8">
who had ordered his men in the mo&s;t peremptory man|ner, not to fire until he &s;hould &s;et the example, gave the &s;ignal by di&s;charging his piece. They fired. No|thing could exceed the inextricable confu&s;ion and appa|rent con&s;ternation occa&s;ioned by this well concerted at|tack. But, at la&s;t, the enemy finding, from the unfre|quency, (though there was no ab&s;olute intermi&s;&s;ion) in the firing, that the number of our men mu&s;t be &s;mall, re&s;olved to land below and &s;urround them. Putnam, apprehen&s;ive of this from the movement, &s;ent Lieute|nant Robert Durkee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the name of the brave Durkee will occur no more in the&s;e &s;heets, I may be indulged in mentioning his melancholy fate. He &s;urvived this war, and was appointed a Captain in that war which terminated in the ac|knowledgment of our Independence. In 1778 he was wounded and taken pri&s;oner by the Savages, at the battle of Wioming on the Su&s;quehannah. Having been condemned to be burnt, the Indians kept him in the flames with pitchforks, until he expired in the mo&s;t excruciating torments.</NOTE>, with twelve men, about thirty rods down the creek, who arrived in time to repul&s;e the party which attempted to land. Another &s;mall detach|ment, under Lieutenant Par&s;ons, was ordered up the creek to prevent any &s;imilar attempt. In the mean time, Major Putnam, kept up (through the whole night) an ince&s;&s;ant and deadly fire on the main body of the ene|my, without receiving any thing in return but &s;hot void of effect, accompanied with dolorous groans, mi&s;erable &s;hrieks and di&s;mal &s;avage yells. After day-break, he was advi&s;ed that one part of the enemy had effected a &s;anding con&s;iderably below, and were rapidly advancing to cut off his retreat. Appri&s;ed of the great &s;uperiority &s;till oppo&s;ed to him, as well as of the &s;ituation of his own &s;oldiers, &s;ome of whom were entirely de&s;titute of
<PB N="223" REF="022578_0223_0FB99915F0CCD7F8">
ammunition, and the re&s;t reduced to one or two rounds per man, he commanded them to &s;wing their packs. By ha&s;tening the retreat, in good order, they had ju&s;t time to retire far enough up the creek to prevent being enclo&s;ed. During this long continued action, in which the Americans had &s;lain at lea&s;t five times their own number, only one Provincial and one Indian were wounded on their &s;ide. The&s;e unfortunate men had been &s;ent off for camp in the night, with two men to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and directions to proceed by Wood-Creek as the &s;afe&s;t, though not the &s;horte&s;t, route. But hav|ing taken a nearer way, they were pur&s;ued and overtaken by the Indians, who, from the blood on the leaves and bu&s;hes, believed that they were on the trail of our whole party. The wounded, de&s;pairing of mercy, and unable to fly, in&s;i&s;ted that the well &s;oldiers &s;hould make their e&s;cape, which, on a moment's deliberation, they effect|ed. The Provincial, who&s;e thigh was broken by a ball, upon the approach of the Savages fired his piece and kil|led three of them; after which he was quickly hacked in pieces. The Indian, however, was &s;aved alive. This man, Major Putnam &s;aw, afterwards, in Canada; where he likewi&s;e learned that his enemy in the rencounter at Wood-Creek, con&s;i&s;ted of five hundred French and Indi|ans, under the command of the celebrated partizan Mo|lang, and that no party, &s;ince the war, had &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely, as more than one half of tho&s;e who went out never returned.</P>
<P>OUR brave little company, reduced to forty in num|ber, had proceeded along the bank of the creek about an hour's march, when, Major Putnam, being in front,
<PB N="224" REF="022578_0224_0FB99922CD5DD830">
was fired upon by a party ju&s;t at hand. He, rightly ap|preciating the advantage often obtained by a&s;&s;uming a bold countenance on a critical occa&s;ion, in a &s;tentoropho|nic tone, ordered his men to ru&s;h on the enemy, and pro|mi&s;ed that they &s;hould &s;oon give a good account of them. It proved to be a &s;cout of Provincials, who conceived they were firing upon the French; but the Commanding Officer, knowing Putnam's voice, cried out, <Q>that they were all friends.</Q>&mdash;Upon this the Major told him ab|ruptly, <Q>that friends or enemies, they all de&s;erved to be hanged for not killing more when they had &s;o fair a &s;hot.</Q> In fact, but one man was mortally wound|ed. While the&s;e things were tran&s;acted, a faithful &s;ol|dier, who&s;e ammunition had been early exhau&s;ted, made his way to the Fort, and gave &s;uch information, that Ge|neral Lyman was detached with five hundred men to co|ver the retreat. Major Putnam met them at only twelve miles di&s;tance from the fort, to which they returned the next day.</P>
<P>IN the winter of 1757, when Colonel Haviland was Commandant of Fort Edward, the barracks adjoining to the north-we&s;t ba&s;tion took fire. They extended within twelve feet of the Magazine, which contained three hun|dred barrels of powder. On its fir&s;t di&s;covery, the fire raged with great violence. The Commandant en|deavoured, in vain, by di&s;charging &s;ome pieces of hea|vy artillery again&s;t the &s;upporters of this flight of bar|racks, to level them with the ground. Putnam arrived from the I&s;land where he was &s;tationed, at the moment when the blaze approached that end which was contigu|ous to the Magazine. In&s;tantly a vigorous attempt was
<PB N="225" REF="022578_0225_0FB999274D036BC0">
made to extingui&s;h the conflagration. A way was open|ed by a po&s;tern gate to the river, and the &s;oldiers were employed in bringing water; which he, having mount|ed on a ladder to the eves of the building, received and threw upon the flame. It continued, notwith&s;tanding their utmo&s;t efforts, to gain upon them. He &s;tood, en|veloped in &s;moke, &s;o near the &s;heet of fire, that a pair of thick blanket mittens were burnt entirely from his hands&mdash;he was &s;upplied with another pair dipt in water. Colonel Haviland fearing that he would peri&s;h in the flames, called to him to come down. But he entreated that he might be &s;uffered to remain, &s;ince de&s;truction mu&s;t inevitably en&s;ue if their exertions &s;hould be re|mitted. The gallant Commandant not le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed than charmed at the boldne&s;s of his conduct, forbade any more effects to be carried out of the fort, animated the men to redoubled diligence, and exclaimed <Q>if we mu&s;t be blown up, we will go all together.</Q> At la&s;t, when the barracks were &s;een to be tumbling, Putnam de&s;cend|ed, placed him&s;elf at the interval, and continued from an ince&s;&s;ant rotation of repleni&s;hed buckets to pour water upon the Magazine. The out&s;ide planks were already con&s;umed by the proximity of the fire, and as only one thickne&s;s of timber intervened, the trepidation now be|came general and extreme. Putnam, &s;till undaunted, covered with a cloud of cinders, and &s;corched with the inten&s;ity of the heat, maintained his po&s;ition until the fire &s;ub&s;ided, and the danger was wholly over. He had contended for one hour and an half with that terrible element. His legs, his thighs, his arms, and his face were bli&s;tered; and when he pulled off his &s;econd pair of mittens, the &s;kin from his hands and fingers followed

them. It was a month before he recovered. The Com|mandant, to whom his merits had before endeared him, could not &s;tifle the emotions of gratitude, due to the man who had been &s;o in&s;trumental in pre&s;erving the Maga|zine, the Fort, and the Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>THE repul&s;e before Ticonderoga, took place in 1758. General Abercrombie, the Briti&s;h Commander in Chief in America, conducted the expedition. His army, which amounted to nearly &s;ixteen thou&s;and Regulars and Pro|vincials, was amply &s;upplied with artillery and military &s;tores. This well-appointed corps pa&s;&s;ed over Lake George, and landed, without oppo&s;ition, at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> point of de&s;tination. The troops advanced in columns. Lord Howe having Major Putnam with him, was in front of the cen|ter. A body of about five hundred men (the advance or pickets of the French army) which had fled at fir&s;t, be|gan to &s;kirmi&s;h with our left. "Putnam," &s;aid Lord Howe, "what means that firing?" <Q>I know not, but with your Lord&s;hip's leave will &s;ee,</Q> replied the for|mer. "I will accompany you," rejoined the gallant young Nobleman. In vain did Major Putnam attempt to di&s;&s;uade him, by &s;aying&mdash;<Q>My Lord, if I am killed, the lo&s;s of my life will be of little con&s;equence, but the pre&s;ervation of yours is of infinite importance to this army.</Q> The only an&s;wer was, Putnam, your <Q>life is as dear to you as mine is to me; I am deter|mined to go.</Q> One hundred of the van, under Major Putnam, filed off with Lord Howe. They &s;oon met the left flank of the enemy's advance, by who&s;e fir&s;t fire his Lord&s;hip &s;ell&mdash;It was a lo&s;s indeed; and particular|ly felt in the operations which occurred three days after|wards.

Examplary to the officer, a friend of the &s;oldier, the model of di&s;cipline, he had not failed to encounter every hard&s;hip and hazard. No|thing could be more calculated to in&s;pire men with the ra&s;h animation of rage, or to temper it with the cool per&s;everance of revenge, than the fight of &s;uch a hero, &s;o beloved, fallen in his country's cau&s;e. It had the effect. Putnam's party, having cut their way obliquely through the enemy's ranks, and having been joined by Captain D'Ell with twenty men, together with &s;ome other &s;mall parties, charged them &s;o furiou&s;ly in rear, that nearly three hundred were killed on the &s;pot, and one hundred and forty-eight made pri&s;oners. In the mean time, from the un&s;kilfulne&s;s of the guides, &s;ome of our columns were bewildered. The left wing, &s;eeing Put|nam's party in their front, advancing over the dead bo|dies towards them, commenced a bri&s;k and heavy fire, which killed a &s;erjeant and &s;everal privates. Nor could they, by &s;ounds or &s;ighs, be convinced of their mi&s;take, until Major Putnam, pre&s;erving (if Heaven had thus or|dained it) the lo&s;s of his own life to the lo&s;s of the lives of his brave a&s;&s;ociates, ran through the mid&s;t of the flying balls, and prevented the impending cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>THE tender feelings, which Major Putnam po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, taught him to re&s;pect an unfortunate foe, and to &s;trive,

by every lenient art in his power to alleviate the mi&s;e|ries of war. For this purpo&s;e, he remained on the field, until it began to grow dark, employed in collecting &s;uch of the enemy as were left wounded, to one place; he gave them all the liquor and little refre&s;hments which he could procure; he furni&s;hed to each of them a blanket; he put three blankets under a French &s;erjeant who was badly wounded through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and placed him in an ea&s;y po&s;ture by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> tree&mdash;the poor fellow could only &s;queeze his hand with an expre&s;&s;ive gra&s;p.

Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e impediments, the engineer, who had been employed to reconnoitre, reported, as his opinion, that the works might be carried with mu&s;quetry. The
<PB N="229" REF="022578_0229_0FB999386E577EB0">
difficulty and delay of dragging the battering cannon, over grounds almo&s;t impracticable, induced the adop|tion of this fatal advice&mdash;to which, however, a rumour that the garri&s;on, already con&s;i&s;ting of four or five thou|&s;and men, was on the point of being augmented with three thou&s;and more, probably contributed. The at|tack was as &s;pirited in execution as ill-judged in de&s;ign. The a&s;&s;ailants, after having been for more than four hours expo&s;ed to a mo&s;t fatal fire, without making any impre&s;&s;ion by their reiterated and ob&s;tinate proofs of valor, were ordered to retreat. Major Putnam, who had acted as an aid in bringing the Provincial regiments &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to action, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pre&s;erving order. It was &s;aid, that a great number of the enemy were &s;hot in the head, every other part having been concealed behind their works. The lo&s;s on our &s;ide was upwards of two thou&s;and killed and wounded. Twenty-five hundred &s;tands of arms were taken by the French. Our army, after &s;u&s;taining this havoc, retreated with &s;uch extraor|dinary precipitation, that they regained their camp at the &s;outhward of Lake George, the evening after the action.</P>

<P>A FEW adventures, in which the public intere&s;ts were little concerned, but which, from their peculiarity, ap|pear worthy of being pre&s;erved, happened before the conclu&s;ion of the year. As one day, Major Putnam chanced to lie, with a batteau and five men, on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Hud&s;on, near the Rapids, contigu|ous to which Fort-Miller &s;tood; his men on the oppo|&s;ite bank had given him to under&s;tand, that a large body of Savages were in his rear, and would be upon him in a moment.&mdash;To &s;tay and be &s;acrificed&mdash;to attempt cro&s;&s;|ing and be &s;hot&mdash;or to go down to the falls, with an al|mo&s;t ab&s;olute certainty of being drowned, were the &s;ole alternatives, that pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his choice. So in&s;tantaneou&s;ly was the latter adopted, that one man who had rambled a little from the party, was, of nece&s;&s;ity, left, and fell a mi&s;erable victim to &s;avage barbarity. The Indians arrived on the &s;hore &s;oon enough to fire many balls on the batteau before it could be got under way. No &s;ooner had our batteau-men e&s;caped, by fa|vor of the rapidity of the current, beyond the reach of mu&s;quet-&s;hot, than death &s;eemed only to have been avoided in one form, to be encountered in another, not le&s;s terrible. Prominent rocks, latent &s;helves, ab&s;orb|ing eddies, and abrupt de&s;cents, for a quarter of a mile, afforded &s;carcely the &s;malle&s;t chance of e&s;caping without a miracle. Putnam, tru&s;ting him&s;elf to a good Provi|dence, who&s;e kindne&s;s he had often experienced, rather than to men, who&s;e tendere&s;t mercies are cruelty, was now &s;een to place him&s;elf &s;edately at the helm, and af|ford

an a&s;toni&s;hing &s;pectacle of &s;erenity: his compani|ons, with a mixture of terror, admiration and wonder, &s;aw him, ince&s;&s;antly changing the cour&s;e, to avoid the jaws of ruin, that &s;eemed expanded to &s;wallow the whirl|ing boat. Twice he turned it fairly round to &s;hun the rifts of rocks. Amid&s;t the&s;e eddies in which there was the greate&s;t danger of its foundering, at one moment the fides were expo&s;ed to the fury of the waves; then the &s;tern, and next the bow glanced obliquely onward, with inconceivable velocity.&mdash;With not le&s;s amazement the Savages beheld him &s;ometimes mounting the billows, then plunging abruptly down, at other times &s;kilfully veering from the rocks, and &s;hooting through the only narrow pa&s;&s;age; until, at la&s;t, they viewed the boat &s;afely gliding on the &s;mooth &s;urface of the &s;tream be|low. At this &s;ight, it is a&s;&s;erted, that the&s;e rude &s;ons of nature were affected with the &s;ame kind of &s;uper&s;ti|tious veneration, which the Europeans in the dark ages entertained for &s;ome of their mo&s;t valorous champions. They deemed the man invulnerable, whom their balls (on his pu&s;hing from &s;hore) would not touch; and whom they had &s;een &s;teering in &s;afety down the rapids that had never before been pa&s;&s;ed. They conceived it would be an affront again&s;t the <HI>Great Spirit,</HI> to attempt to kill this favoured mortal with powder and ball, if they &s;hould ever &s;ee and know him again.</P>
<P>IN the month of Augu&s;t, five hundred men were em|ployed, under the orders of Majors Rogers and Putnam, to watch the motions of the enemy near Ticonderoga. At South-Bay they &s;eparated the party into two equal

divi&s;ions, and Rogers took a po&s;ition on Wood-Creek, twelve miles di&s;tant from Putnam.</P>
<P>UPON being, &s;ome time afterwards, di&s;covered, they formed a re-union, and concerted mea&s;ures for returning to Fort-Edward. Their march through the woods, was <HI>in three divi&s;ions by</HI> FILES, the right commanded by Ro|gers, the left by Putnam, and the centre by Captain D'Ell. The fir&s;t night they encamped on the banks of <HI>Clear River,</HI> about a mile from old Fort-Ann, which had been formerly built by General Nichol&s;on. Next morning, Major Rogers and a Briti&s;h officer, named Irwin, in|cautiou&s;ly &s;uffered them&s;elves from a &s;pirit of fal&s;e emu|lation, to be engaged in firing at a mark. Nothing could have been more repugnant to the military principles of Putnam than &s;uch conduct; or reprobated by him in more pointed terms. As &s;oon as the heavy dew which had fallen the preceding night would permit, the detachment moved in one body, Putnam being in front, D'Ell in center, and Rogers in the rear. The impervious growth of &s;hrubs, and under-bru&s;h that had &s;prung up, where the land had been partially cleared &s;ome years before, occa|&s;ioned this change in the order of march. At the moment of moving, the famous French partizan Molang, who had been &s;ent with five hundred men to intercept our party, was not more than one mile and an half di&s;tant from them. Having heard the firing, he ha&s;ted to lay an ambu&s;cade pre|ci&s;ely in that part of the wood mo&s;t favorable to his pro|ject. Major Putnam was ju&s;t emerging from the thicket, into the common fore&s;t, when the enemy ro&s;e, and with di&s;cordant yells and whoops, commenced an attack upon the right of his divi&s;ion. Surpri&s;ed, but undi&s;mayed&punc;
<PB N="233" REF="022578_0233_0FB99943CD8AA8D8">
Putnam halted, returned the fire, and pa&s;&s;ed the word for the other divi&s;ions to advance for his &s;upport. D'Ell came. The action, though widely &s;cattered, and prin|cipally fought between man and man, &s;oon grew gene|ral and inten&s;ely warm. It would be as difficult as u&s;e|le&s;s to de&s;cribe this irregular and ferocious mode of fight|ing. Rogers came not up: but, as he declared after|wards, formed a circular file between our party and Wood-Creek, to prevent their being taken in rear or en|filaded. Succe&s;sful as he commonly was, his conduct did not always pa&s;s without unfavorable imputation. Notwith&s;tanding, it was a current &s;aying in the camp, "that Rogers always <HI>&s;ent,</HI> but Putnam <HI>led</HI> his men to action," yet, in ju&s;tice, it ought to be remark|ed here, that the latter has never been known, in relat|ing the &s;tory of this day's di&s;a&s;ter, to affix any &s;tigma up|on the conduct of the former.</P>
<P>MAJOR Putnam, perceiving it would be impractica|ble to cro&s;s the creek, determined to maintain his ground. In&s;pired by his example, the officers and men behaved with great bravery: &s;ometimes they fought ag|gregately in open view, and &s;ometimes individually un|der cover; taking aim from behind the bodies of trees, and acting in a manner independent of each other. For him&s;elf, having di&s;charged his fuzee &s;everal times, at length it mi&s;&s;ed fire, while the muzzle was pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the brea&s;t of a large and well proportioned Savage. This <HI>warrior,</HI> availing him&s;elf of the indefen&s;ible atti|tude of his adver&s;ary, with a tremendous war-hoop &s;prang forward, with his lifted hatchet, and compelled
<PB N="234" REF="022578_0234_0FB9994586165598">
him to &s;urrender; and having di&s;armed and bound him fa&s;t to a tree, returned to the battle.</P>
<P>THE intrepid Captains D'Ell and Harman, who now commanded, were forced to give ground for a little di&s;|tance: the Savages, conceiving this to be the certain harbinger of victory, ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly on, with dread|ful and redoubled cries. But our two partizans, col|lecting a handful of brave men, gave the pur&s;uers &s;o warm a reception as to oblige them, in turn to retreat a little beyond the &s;pot at which the action had commen|ced. Here they made a &s;tand. This change of ground occa&s;ioned the tree to which Putnam was tied to be di|rectly between the fire of the two parties. Human ima|gination can hardly figure to it&s;elf a more deplorable &s;i|tuation. The balls flew ince&s;&s;antly from either &s;ide, ma|ny &s;truck the tree, while &s;ome pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;leeves and &s;kirts of his coat. In this &s;tate of jeopardy, unable to move his body, to &s;tir his limbs, or even to incline his head, he remained more than an hour. So equally bal|anced, and &s;o ob&s;tinate was the fight! At one moment, while the battle &s;werved in favor of the enemy, a young Savage, cho&s;e an odd way of di&s;covering his humor. He found Putnam bound. He might have di&s;patched him at a blow. But he loved better to excite the terrors of the pri|&s;oner, by hurling a tomahawk at his head, or rather it &s;hould &s;eem his object was to &s;ee how near he could throw it with|out touching him&mdash;the weapon &s;truck in the tree a number of times at a hair's breath di&s;tance from the mark. When the Indian had fini&s;hed his amu&s;ement, a French Ba&s;-Of|ficer (a much more inveterate &s;avage by nature, though de&s;cended from &s;o humane and poli&s;hed a nation) per|ceiving
<PB N="235" REF="022578_0235_0FB9994A7B54BC68">
Putnam, came up to him, and, levelling a fu|zee within a foot of his brea&s;t, attempted to di&s;charge it; it mi&s;&s;ed fire&mdash;ineffectually did the intended victim, &s;oli|cit the treatment due to his &s;ituation, by repeating, that he was a pri&s;oner of war. The degenerate Frenchman did not under&s;tand the language of honor or of nature: deaf to their voice, and dead to &s;en&s;ibility, he violently, and repeatedly, pu&s;hed the muzzle of his gun again&s;t Put|nam's ribs, and finally, gave him a cruel blow on the jaw with the butt of his piece. After this da&s;tardly deed he left him.</P>
<P>AT length the active intrepidity of D'Ell and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This worthy officer is &s;till living at Marlborough, in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</NOTE> Har|man, &s;econded by the per&s;evering valor of their follow|ers, prevailed. They drove from the field the enemy, who left about ninety dead behind them. As they were retiring Putnam was untied by the Indian who had made him pri&s;oner and whom he afterwards called ma&s;|ter. Having been conducted for &s;ome di&s;tance from the place of action, he was &s;tripped of his coat, ve&s;t, &s;tock|ings and &s;hoes; loaded with as many of the packs of the wounded as could be piled upon him; &s;trongly pinion|ed, and his wri&s;ts tied as clo&s;ely together as they could be pulled with a cord. After he had marched, through no plea&s;ant paths, in this painful manner, for many a tedious mile, the party (who were exce&s;&s;ively fatigued) halted to breathe. His hands were now immoderately &s;welled from the tightne&s;s of the ligature: and the pain had become intolerable. His feet were &s;o much &s;cratched that the blood dropped fa&s;t from them. Ex|hau&s;ted with bearing a burden above his &s;trength, and
<PB N="236" REF="022578_0236_0FB9994DC9798D68">
frantic with torments exqui&s;ite beyond endurance; he entreated the Iri&s;h Interpreter to implore as the la&s;t and only grace he de&s;ired of the Savages, that they would knock him on the head and take his &s;calp at once, or loo&s;e his hands. A French officer, in&s;tantly interpo&s;ing, ordered his hands to be unbound, and &s;ome of the packs to be taken off. By this time the Indian who captured him and had been ab&s;ent with the wounded, coming up, gave him a pair of moca&s;ons, and expre&s;&s;ed great indig|uation at the unworthy treatment his pri&s;oner had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>THAT Savage Chief again returned to the care of the wounded, and the Indians, about two hundred in num|ber, went before the re&s;t of the party to the place where the whole were, that night, to encamp. They took with them Major Putnam, on whom be&s;ides innumera|ble other outrages, they had the barbarity to inflict a deep wound with a tomahawk, in the left cheek. His &s;ufferings were in this place to be con&s;ummated. A &s;cene of horror, infinitely greater than had ever met his eyes before, was now preparing. It was determined to roa&s;t him alive.&mdash;For this purpo&s;e they led him into a dark fore&s;t, &s;tripped him naked, bound him to a tree, and piled dry bru&s;h with other fuel, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, in a circle round him. They accompanied their labors, as if for his funeral dirge, with &s;creams and &s;ounds ini|mitable but by &s;avage voices. Then they &s;et the piles on fire. A &s;udden &s;hower damped the ri&s;ing flame. Still they &s;trove to kindle it, until, at la&s;t, the blaze ran fiercely round the circle. Major Putnam &s;oon began to feel the &s;corching heat. His hands were &s;o tied that he could move his body. He often &s;hifted &s;ides as the fire
<PB N="237" REF="022578_0237_0FB999514B3D8C58">
approached. This &s;ight, at the very idea of which all but Savages mu&s;t &s;hudder, afforded the highe&s;t diver&s;ion to his inhuman tormentors, who demon&s;trated the delirium of their joy by corre&s;pondent yells, dances and ge&s;ticu|lations. He &s;aw clearly that his final hour was inevi|tably come. He &s;ummoned all his re&s;olution and com|po&s;ed his mind, as far as the circum&s;tances could admit, to bid an eternal farewel to all he held mo&s;t dear. To quit the world would &s;carcely have co&s;t a &s;ingle pang, but for the idea of home, but for the remembrance of dome&s;tic endearments, of the affectionate partner of his &s;oul, and of their beloved off&s;pring. His thought was ultimately fixed on a happier &s;tate of exi&s;tence, beyond the tortures he was beginning to endure. The bitter|ne&s;s of death, even of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> death which is accompanied with the keene&s;t agonies, was, in a manner, pa&s;t&mdash;na|ture, with a feeble &s;truggle, was quitting its la&s;t hold on &s;ublunary things&mdash;when a French officer ru&s;hed through the crowd, opened a way by &s;cattering the burning brands, and unbound the victim. It was Mo|lang him&s;elf&mdash;to whom a Savage, unwilling to &s;ee ano|ther human &s;acrifice immolated, had run and communicat|ed the tidings. That Commandant &s;purned and &s;everely reprimanded the barbarians, who&s;e nocturnal Powwas and helli&s;h Orgies he &s;uddenly ended. Putnam did not want for feeling or gratitude. The French Command|er, fearing to tru&s;t him alone with them, remained un|til he could deliver him in &s;afety into the hands of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE Savage approached his pri&s;oner kindly, and &s;eemed to treat him with particular affection. He of|fered
<PB N="238" REF="022578_0238_0FB99952B47FD990">
him &s;ome hard bi&s;cuit, but finding that he could not chew them, on account of the blow he had received from the Frenchman, this more humane Savage &s;oaked &s;ome of the bui&s;cuit in water and made him &s;uck the pulp-like part. Determined, however, not to lo&s;e his captive (the refre&s;hment being fini&s;hed) he took the mo|ca&s;ons from his feet and tied them to one of his wri&s;ts: then directing him to lie down on his back upon the bare ground, he &s;tretched one arm to its full length, and bound it fa&s;t to young tree; the other arm was ex|tended and bound in the &s;ame manner&mdash;his legs were &s;tretched apart and fa&s;tened to two &s;aplings. Then a number of tall, but &s;lender poles were cut down; which, with &s;ome long bu&s;hes, were laid acro&s;s his body from head to foot: on each &s;ide lay as many Indians as could convenienly find lodging, in order to prevent the po&s;&s;i|bility of his e&s;cape. In this di&s;agreeable and painful po&s;ture he remained until morning. During this night, the longe&s;t and mo&s;t dreary conceivable, our hero u&s;ed to relate that he felt a ray of cheerfulne&s;s come ca&s;ually acro&s;s his mind, and could not even refrain from &s;miling, when he reflected on this ludicrous groupe for a paint|er, of which he him&s;elf was the principal figure.</P>
<P>THE next day he was allowed his blanket and moca|&s;ons, and permitted to march without carrying any pack, or receiving any in&s;ult. To allay his extreme hunger, a little bear's meat was given, which he &s;uck|ed through his teeth. At night, the party arrived at Ticonderoga, and the pri&s;onor was placed under the care of a French guard. The Savages, who had been prevented from glutting their diabolical thir&s;t for blood,

took other opportunity of manife&s;ting their malevo|lence for the di&s;appointment, by horrid grimaces and angry ge&s;tures; but they were &s;uffered no more to offer violence or per&s;onal indignity to him.</P>
<P>AFTER having been examined by the Marquis de Montcalm, Major Putnam was conducted to Montreal, by a French officer, who treated him with the greate&s;t indulgence and humanity.</P>
<P>AT this place were &s;everal pri&s;oners. Colonel Peter Schuyler, remarkable for his philanthropy, genero&s;ity, and friend&s;hip, was of the number. No &s;ooner had he heard of Major Putnam's arrival, than he went to the Interpreter's quarters, and enquired, whether he had a Provincial Major in his cu&s;tody? He found Major Put|nam in a comfortle&s;s condition&mdash;without coat, wai&s;tcoat, or ho&s;e&mdash;the remnant of his cloathing mi&s;erably dirty and ragged&mdash;his beard long and &s;qualid&mdash;his legs torn by thorns and briars&mdash;his face ga&s;hed with wounds, and &s;wollen with brui&s;es. Colonel Schuyler, irritated be|yond all &s;ufferance at &s;uch a &s;ight, could &s;carcely re&s;train his &s;peech within limits, con&s;i&s;tent with the prudence of a pri&s;oner and the meekne&s;s of a Chri&s;tian. Major Put|nam was immediately treated according to his rank, cloathed in a decent manner, and &s;upplied with money by that liberal and &s;ympathetic patron of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<PB N="240" REF="022578_0240_0FB9995E8A64CC10">
&s;pirit can never be &s;atisfied with impo&s;ing ta&s;ks for its genero&s;ity to accompli&s;h. Apprehen&s;ive, if it &s;hould be known that Putnam was a di&s;tingui&s;hed partizan, his liberation might be retarded, and knowing that there were officers, who, from the length of their captivity, had a claim of priority to exchange; he had, by his happy addre&s;s, induced the Governor to offer, that what|ever officer he might think proper to nominate, &s;hould be included in the pre&s;ent cartel. With great politene&s;s in manner, but &s;eeming indifference as to object, he ex|pre&s;&s;ed his warme&s;t acknowledgements to the Governor, and &s;aid: <Q>There is an old man here, who is a Provin|cial Major, and wi&s;hes to be at home with his wife and children. He can do no good here, or any where el&s;e: I believe your Excellency had better keep &s;ome of the young men, who have no wife or children to care for, and let the old fellow go home with me.</Q> This ju&s;|tifiable fine&s;&s;e had the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>AT the hou&s;e of Colonel Schuyler, Major Putnam be|came acquainted with Mrs. Howe, a fair captive, who&s;e hi&s;tory would not be read without emotion, if it could be written in the &s;ame affecting manner, in which I have often heard it told. She was &s;till young and hand&s;ome her&s;elf, though &s;he had two daughters of marriageable age. Di&s;tre&s;s, which had taken &s;omewhat from the ori|ginal redundancy of her bloom, and added a &s;oftening palene&s;s to her cheeks, rendered her appearance the more engaging. Her face, that &s;eemed to have been formed for the a&s;&s;emblage of dimples and &s;miles, was clouded with care. The natural &s;weetne&s;s was not, however, &s;oured by de&s;pondency and petulance; but cha&s;tened by
<PB N="241" REF="022578_0241_0FB9995F762DF308">
humility and re&s;ignation. This mild daughter of &s;orrow looked as if &s;he had known the day of pro&s;perity, when &s;erenity and gladne&s;s of &s;oul were the inmates of her bo|&s;om. That day was pa&s;t, and the once lively features, now a&s;&s;umed a tender melancholy, which witne&s;&s;ed her irreparable lo&s;s. She needed not the cu&s;tomary weeds of mourning, or the fallacious pageantry of woe to prove her widowed &s;tate. She was in that &s;tage of affliction, when the exce&s;s is &s;o far abated as to permit the &s;ubject to be drawn into conver&s;ation, without opening the wound afre&s;h. It is then rather a &s;ource of plea&s;ure than pain to dwell upon the circum&s;tances in narration. Eve|ry thing con&s;pired to make her &s;tory intere&s;ting. Her fir&s;t hu&s;band had been killed and &s;calped by the Indians &s;ome years before. By an unexpected a&s;&s;ault in 1756 upon Fort Dummer, where &s;he then happened to be pre|&s;ent with Mr. Howe, her &s;econd hu&s;band, the Savages car|ried the Fort, murdered the greater part of the garri&s;on, mangled in death her hu&s;band, and led her away with &s;even children into captivity. She was for &s;ome months kept with them: and during their rambles &s;he was fre|quently on the point of peri&s;hing with hunger, and as often &s;ubjected to hard&s;hips &s;eemingly intolerable to one of &s;o delicate a frame. Some time after the career of her mi&s;eries began, the Indians &s;elected a couple of their young men to marry her daughters. The fright and di&s;gu&s;t which the intelligence of this intention occa&s;i|oned to the&s;e poor young creatures, added infinitely to the &s;orrows and perplexities of their frantic mother. To prevent the hated connection, all the activity of female re&s;ource was called into exertion. She found an oppor|tunity of conveying to the Governor a petition, that her
<PB N="242" REF="022578_0242_0FB9996764B15B38">
daughters might be received into a convent for the &s;ake of &s;ecuring the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls. Happily the pi|ous fraud &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time the Savages &s;eparated, and car|ried off her other five children into different tribes. She was ran&s;omed by an elderly French officer, for four hun|dred livres. Of no avail were the cries of this tender mother&mdash;a mother de&s;olated by the lo&s;s of her children, who were thus torn from her fond embraces, and re|moved many hundred miles from each other, into the ut|mo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of Canada. With them (could they have been kept together) &s;he would mo&s;t willingly have wandered to the extremities of the world, and accepted as a de&s;ira|ble portion the cruel lot of &s;lavery for life. But &s;he was precluded from the &s;weet hope of ever beholding them again. The in&s;ufferable pang of parting, and the idea of eternal &s;eparation planted the arrows of de&s;pair deep in her &s;oul. Though all the world was no better than a de|&s;ert, and all its inhabitants were then indifferent to her&mdash;yet the loveline&s;s of her appearance in &s;orrow had awakened affections, which, in the aggravation of her troubles, were to become a new &s;ource of afflictions.</P>
<P>THE officer, who bought her of the Indians, had a &s;on, who al&s;o held a commi&s;&s;ion, and re&s;ided with his fa|ther. During her continuance in the &s;ame hou&s;e, at St. John's, the double attachment of the father and the &s;on, rendered her &s;ituation extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. It is true, the calmne&s;s of age delighted to gaze re&s;pectfully on her beauty, but the impetuo&s;ity of youth was fired to mad|ne&s;s by the &s;ight of her charms. One day, the &s;on, who&s;e
<PB N="243" REF="022578_0243_0FB999693A4B7258">
attentions had been long lavi&s;hed upon her in vain, find|ing her alone, in a chamber, forcibly &s;eized her hand, and &s;olemnly declared, that he would now &s;atiate the pa&s;&s;ion which &s;he had &s;o long refu&s;ed to indulge. She recurred to intreaties, &s;truggles, and tears, tho&s;e pre|valent female weapons, which the di&s;traction of danger, not le&s;s than the promptne&s;s of genius is wont to &s;upply: while he, in the delirium of vexation and de&s;ire, &s;natch|ed a dagger, and &s;wore he would put an end to her life, if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted to &s;truggle. Mrs. Howe, a&s;&s;uming the dignity of con&s;cious virtue, told him, it was what &s;he mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hed, and begged him to plunge the poignard through her heart, &s;ince the mutual importu|nities and jealou&s;ies of &s;uch rivals, had rendered her life, though innocent, more irk&s;ome and in&s;upportable, than death it&s;elf. Struck with a momentary compunction, he &s;eemed to relent, and relax his hold&mdash;and &s;he, avail|ing her&s;elf of his irre&s;olution, or ab&s;ence of mind, e&s;caped down the &s;tairs. In her di&s;ordered &s;tate, &s;he told the whole tran&s;action to his father, who directed her, in future, to &s;leep in a &s;mall bed at the foot of that in which his wife lodged. The affair &s;oon reached the Governor's ears, and the young officer was, &s;hortly afterwards, &s;ent on a tour of duty to <HI>Detroit.</HI></P>
<P>THIS gave her a &s;hort re&s;pite; but &s;he dreaded his return, and the humiliating in&s;ults for which &s;he might be re&s;erved. Her children, too, were ever pre&s;ent to her melancholy mind. A &s;tranger, a widow, a captive, &s;he knew not where to apply for relief. She had heard of the name of Schuyler&mdash;&s;he was yet to learn, that it was only another appellation for the friend of &s;uffering hu|manity.
<PB N="244" REF="022578_0244_0FB9996AC22D5F80">
As that excellent man was on his way from Quebec to the Jer&s;eys, under a parole for a limited time, &s;he came with feeble and trembling &s;teps to him. The &s;ame maternal pa&s;&s;ion, which, &s;ometimes, overcomes the timidity of nature in the birds, when plundered of their callow ne&s;tlings, emboldened her, notwith&s;tanding her native diffidence, to di&s;clo&s;e tho&s;e griefs which were rea|dy to devour her in &s;ilence. While her delicate a&s;pect was heightened to a glowing blu&s;h, for fear of offend|ing by an inexcu&s;able importunity, or of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the rules of propriety, by repre&s;enting her&s;elf as being an object of admiration; &s;he told, with artle&s;s &s;impli|city, all the &s;tory of her woes. Colonel Schuyler, from that moment became her protector, and endeavored to procure her liberty. The per&s;on who purcha&s;ed her from the Savages, unwilling to part with &s;o fair a pur|cha&s;e, demanded a thou&s;and livres as her ran&s;om. But Colonel Schuyler, on his return to Quebec, obtained from the Governor an order, in con&s;equence of which, Mrs. Howe was given up to him for four hundred livres&mdash;Nor did his active goodne&s;s re&s;t, until every one of her five &s;ons was re&s;tored to her.</P>
<P>BUSINESS having made it nece&s;&s;ary that Colonel Schuyler &s;hould precede the pri&s;oners who were exchang|ed, he recommended the fair captive to the protection of his friend Putnam. She had ju&s;t recovered from the meazles when the party was preparing to &s;et off for New|England. By this time the young French officer had returned, with his pa&s;&s;ion rather increa&s;ed than abated by ab&s;ence. He pur&s;ued her where&s;oever &s;he went, and, al|though he could make no advances in her affection, he
<PB N="245" REF="022578_0245_0FB9996C666DDC30">
&s;eemed re&s;olved by per&s;everance to carry his point. Mrs. Howe, terrified by his treatment, was obliged to keep con&s;tantly near Major Putnam, who informed the young officer, that he &s;hould protect that lady at the ri&s;que of his life. However, this amorous and ra&s;h lover, in who&s;e boiling veins &s;uch an agitation was excited, that while he was &s;peaking of her the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This phy&s;ical effect, wonderful as it may appear, is &s;o far from being a fictitious embelli&s;hment, that it can be proved by the mo&s;t &s;olemn te&s;timony of more than one per&s;on &s;till living.</NOTE> blood would fre|quently gu&s;h from his no&s;trils, followed the pri&s;oners to Lake Champlain; and, when the boat in which the fair captive was embarked, had pu&s;hed from the &s;hore, he jumped into the Lake, and &s;wam after her until it row|ed out of &s;ight. Whether he peri&s;hed in this di&s;tracted &s;tate of mind, or returned to the &s;hore, is not known.</P>
<P>IN the long march from captivity, through an inho&s;|pitable wilderne&s;s, encumbered with five &s;mall children, &s;he &s;uffered incredible hard&s;hips. Though endowed with ma&s;culine fortitude, &s;he was truly feminine in &s;trength, and mu&s;t have fainted by the way, had it not been for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Major Putnam. There were a thou&s;and good offices which the helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of her con|dition demanded, and which the gentlene&s;s of his nature delighted to perform. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted in leading her little ones, and in carrying them over the &s;wampy grounds and runs of water, with which their cour&s;e was fre|quently inter&s;ected. He mingled his own me&s;s with that of the widow and the fatherle&s;s, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in &s;upplying and preparing their provi&s;ions. Upon ar|riving

within the &s;ettlements they experienced a recipro|cal regret at &s;eparation, and were only con&s;oled by the expectation of &s;oon mingling in the embraces of their former acquaintances and deare&s;t connections.</P>
<P>AFTER the conque&s;t of Canada in 1760, &s;he made a journey to Quebec, in order to bring back her two daughters whom &s;he had left in a convent. She found one of them married to a French officer. The other, having contracted a great fondne&s;s for the religious &s;i&s;|terhood, with reluctance, con&s;ented to leave them and return.</P>
<P>A FEW years previous to the war between Great Bri|tain and America, a que&s;tion of &s;ome con&s;equence aro&s;e re&s;pecting the title of the lands in Hin&s;dale (the town in which Mrs. Howe re&s;ided) in&s;omuch that it was deem|ed expedient, that an Agent &s;hould be &s;ent to England to advocate the claim of the town. It may be mention|ed as a proof of the acknowledged &s;uperiority of the un|der&s;tanding and addre&s;s of this gentlewoman, that &s;he was univer&s;ally de&s;ignated for the mi&s;&s;ion. But the di&s;|pute was fortunately accommodated to the &s;ati&s;faction of the people, without their being obliged to make u&s;e of her talents.</P>
<P>WE now arrive at the period, when the prowe&s;s of Britain, victorious, alike by &s;ea and by land, in the new and in the old world, had elevated that name to the zenith of national glory. The conque&s;t of Quebec, opened the way for the total reduction of Canada. On the &s;ide of the Lakes, Amher&s;t having captured the po&s;ts
<PB N="247" REF="022578_0247_0FB99979C6B77798">
of Ticonderoga and Crown-Point, applied him&s;elf to &s;trengthen the latter. Putnam, who had been rai&s;ed to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and pre&s;ent at the&s;e ope|rations, was employed the remainder of this and &s;ome part of the &s;ucceeding &s;ea&s;on in &s;uperintending the par|ties, which were detached to procure timber and other materials for the fortification.</P>
<P>IN 1760 General Amher&s;t, a &s;agacious, humane, and experienced commander, planned the termination of the war in Canada, by a bloodle&s;s conque&s;t. For this pur|po&s;e, three armies were de&s;tined to co-operate by differ|ent routes again&s;t Montreal, the only remaining place of &s;trength the enemy held in that country. The corps formerly commanded by General Wolfe, now by Ge|neral Murray, was ordered to a&s;cend the river St. Law|rence; another (under Col. Haviland) to penetrate by the I&s;le Aux Noix; and the third, con&s;i&s;ting of about ten thou&s;and men, commanded by the General him&s;elf, after pa&s;&s;ing up the Mohawk-river, and taking its cour&s;e by the Lake Ontario, was to form a junction by falling down the St. Lawrence. In this progre&s;s, more than one occa&s;ion pre&s;ented it&s;elf manife&s;t the intrepi|dity and &s;oldier&s;hip Lieutenant Colonel Putnam. Two armed ve&s;&s;els ob&s;tructed the pa&s;&s;age and prevented the attack on O&s;wegatchie. Putnam, with 1000 men, in 50 batteaux, undertook to board them. This daunt|le&s;s officer, ever &s;paring of the blood of others, as pro|digal of his own, to accompli&s;h it with the le&s;s lo&s;s, put him&s;elf (with a cho&s;en crew, a beetle and wedges) in the van, with a de&s;ign to wedge the rudders, &s;o that the ve&s;&s;els &s;hould not be able to turn their broad&s;ides or
<PB N="248" REF="022578_0248_0FB9997D18DCDE40">
perform any other manoeuvre. All the men in his little fleet were ordered to &s;trip to their wai&s;tcoats, and ad|vance at the &s;ame time. He promi&s;ed, if he lived, to join and &s;hew them the way up the &s;ides. Animated by &s;o daring an example, they moved &s;wiftly, in pro|found &s;tillne&s;s, as to certain victory or death. The peo|ple on board the &s;hips, beholding the good countenance with which they approached, ran one of the ve&s;&s;els on &s;hore, and &s;truck the colors of the other. Had it not been for the da&s;tardly conduct of the &s;hip's company, in the latter, who compelled the Captain to haul down his en&s;ign, he would have given the a&s;&s;ailants a bloody re|ception. For the ve&s;&s;els were well provided with &s;pears, nettings, and every cu&s;tomary in&s;trument of annoy|ance as well as defence.</P>
<P>IT now remained to attack the fortre&s;s, which &s;tood on an I&s;land, and &s;eemed to have been rendered inacce&s;&s;ible by an high abbattis of black-a&s;h, that every where projected over the water. Lieutenant Colonel Putnam propo&s;ed a mode of attack, and offered his &s;ervices to carry it in|to effect. The General approved the propo&s;al. Our partizan, accordingly, cau&s;ed a &s;ufficient number of boats to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itted for the enterprize. The &s;ides of each boat were &s;urrounded with fa&s;cines (mu&s;quet proof) which covered the men compleatly. A wide plank, twenty feet in length, was then fitted to every boat in &s;uch manner, by having an angular piece &s;awed from one extremity, that, when fa&s;tened by ropes on both &s;ides of the bow, it might be rai&s;ed or lowered at plea&s;ure. The de&s;ign was, that the plank &s;hould be held erect, while the oar&s;men forced the bow with the utmo&s;t exertion again&s;t the abat|tis;
<PB N="249" REF="022578_0249_0FB9997E32A7B278">
and that, afterwards, being dropped on the pointed bru&s;h, it &s;hould &s;erve as a kind of bridge to a&s;&s;i&s;t the men in pa&s;&s;ing over them. Lieutenant Colonel Putnam, having made his di&s;po&s;itions to attempt the e&s;calade in many places at the &s;ame moment, advanced with his boats in admirable order. The garri&s;on, perceiving the&s;e extraordinary and unexpected machines, waited not the a&s;&s;ault, but capitulated. Lieutenant Colonel Putnam, was particularly honored by General Amher&s;t, for his ingenuity in this invention, and promptitude in its ex|ecution. The three armies arrived at Montreal, within two days of each other; and the conque&s;t of Canada be|came compleat without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle drop of blood.</P>
<P>AT no great di&s;tance from Montreal, &s;tands the Savage village, called Cochnawaga. Here our partizan found the Indian Chief, who had formerly made him pri&s;oner. That Indian was highly delighted to &s;ee his old ac|quaintance, whom he entertained in his own well-built &s;tone hou&s;e, with great friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality; while his gue&s;t did not di&s;cover le&s;s &s;atisfaction in an oppor|tunity of &s;haking the brave Savage by the hand, and proffering him protection in this rever&s;e of his military fortunes.</P>
<P>WHEN the belligerent powers were con&s;iderably ex|hau&s;ted, a rupture took place between Great Britain and Spain, in the month of January, 1762, and an ex|pedition was formed that campaign, under Lord Albe|marle, again&s;t the Havannah. A body of Provincials, compo&s;ed of five hundred men from the Jer&s;eys, eight hundred from New-York, and one thou&s;and from Con|necticut,
<PB N="250" REF="022578_0250_0FB999812EE46CD0">
joined his Lord&s;hip. General Lyman, who rai&s;ed the regiment of one thou&s;and men in Connecticut&punc; being the &s;enior officer, commanded the whole: of cour&s;e, the immediate command of his regiment developed upon Lieutenant Colonel Putnam. The fleet, that carried the&s;e troops, &s;ailed from New-York, and arrived &s;afely on the coa&s;t of Cuba. There a terrible &s;torm aro&s;e, and the tran&s;port, in which Lieutenant Colonel Putnam had embarked with five hundred men, was wrecked on a rift of craggy rocks. The weather was &s;o tempe&s;tu|ous, and the &s;urf, which ran mountain-high, da&s;hed with &s;uch violence again&s;t the &s;hip, that the mo&s;t experien|ced &s;eamen expected it would &s;oon part a&s;under. The re&s;t of the fleet, &s;o far from being able to afford a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, with difficulty rode out the gale. In this deplor|able &s;ituation, as the only expedient by which they could be &s;aved, &s;trict order was maintained, and all tho&s;e people, who be&s;t under&s;tood the u&s;e of tools, in&s;tantly employed in con&s;tructing rafts from &s;pars, plank, and whatever other materials could be procured. There happened to be on board, a large quantity of &s;trong cords, (the &s;ame that are u&s;ed in the whale fi&s;hery) which, be|ing fa&s;tened to the rafts, after the fir&s;t had with incon|ceivable hazard reached the &s;hore, were of infinite &s;er|vice, in preventing the others from driving out to &s;ea, as al&s;o in dragging them athwart the billows, to the beach: by which means, every man was finally &s;aved. With the &s;ame pre&s;ence of mind, to take advantage of circum&s;tances, and the &s;ame precaution to prevent con|fu&s;ion, of &s;imilar occa&s;ions, how many valuable lives, prematurely lo&s;t, might have been pre&s;erved as ble&s;&s;ings to their families, their friends, and their country. As

&s;oon as all were landed, Lieutenant Colonel Putnam for|tified his camp, that he might not be expo&s;ed to in&s;ult, from the inhabitants of the neighboring di&s;tricts, or from tho&s;e of Carthagena, who were but twenty-four miles di&s;tant. Here the party remained unmole&s;ted &s;e|veral days, until the &s;torm had &s;o much abated, as to permit the convoy to take them off.

<P>ALTHOUGH a general peace among the European powers was ratified in 1763, yet the Savages, on our we&s;tern frontiers, &s;till continued their ho&s;tilities. After they had taken &s;everal po&s;ts, General Brad&s;treet was &s;ent in 1764, with an army again&s;t them. Colonel Put|nam, then, for the fir&s;t time, appointed to the command of a regiment, was on the expidition; as was the In|dian

Chief, (whom I have &s;everal times had occa&s;ion to mention as his capturer) at the head of one hundred Cochnawaga-warriors. Before General Brad&s;treet reach|ed Detroit, which the Savages inve&s;ted, Captain D'Ell, the faithful friend, and intrepid fellow-&s;oldier of Colo|nel Putnam, had been &s;lain in a de&s;perate &s;ally.

But the garri&s;on, (commanded by Major Gladwine, a brave and &s;en&s;ible officer) had been &s;o much weakened, by the lurking and in&s;iduous mode of war, practi&s;ed by the Savages, that not a man could be &s;pared to co-operate in an attack up|on them. The Commandant would even have di&s;&s;uaded Captain D'Ell from the attempt, on account of the great di&s;parity in numbers; but the latter, relying on the di&s;cipline and courage of his men, replied, <Q>God for|bid, that I &s;hould ever di&s;obey the orders of my Ge|neral,</Q> and immediately di&s;po&s;ed them for action. It was ob&s;tinate and bloody. But the va&s;tly &s;uperior num|ber of the Savages, enabled them to enclo&s;e Captain D'Ell's party on every &s;ide, and compelled him, finally, to fight his way, in retreat from one &s;tone-hou&s;e to ano|ther. Having halted to breathe a moment, he &s;aw one of his brave&s;t &s;erjeants, lying at a &s;mall di&s;tance, wound|ed through the thigh, and wallowing in his blood. Whereupon he de&s;ired &s;ome of the men, to run, and bring the &s;erjeant to the hou&s;e, but they declined it. Then declaring, <Q>that he never would leave &s;o brave a &s;oldier in the field, to be tortured by the Savages,</Q> he ran and endeavoured to help him up&mdash;at the in&s;tant, a volley of &s;hot dropped them both dead together. The
<PB N="251" REF="022578_0253_0FB9998D88AA3360">
party continued retreating, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, until they regained the Fort; where it was found, the conflict had been &s;o &s;harp, and la&s;ted &s;o long, that only fifty men remained alive, of the five hundred, who had &s;allied.</P>
<P>UPON the arrival of General Brad&s;treet, the Savages &s;aw, that all further efforts, in arms, would be vain, and, accordingly, after many fallacious propo&s;als for a peace, and frequent tergiver&s;ations in the negociation, they con|cluded a treaty, which ended the war in America.</P>
<P>COLONEL Putnam, at the expiration of ten years from his fir&s;t receiving a Commi&s;&s;ion, after having &s;een as much &s;ervice, endured as many hard&s;hips, encountered as many dangers, and acquired as many laurels as any officers of his rank, with great &s;atisfaction, laid a&s;ide his uniform and returned to his plough. The various and uncommon &s;cenes of war in which he had acted a re&s;pect|able part, his intercour&s;e with the world and intimacy with &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in the army, joined with occa&s;ional reading, had not only brought into view what|ever talents he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed from nature, but, at the &s;ame time, had extended his knowledge and poli&s;hed his man|ners to a con&s;iderable degree. Not having become in|flated with pride or forgetful of his old connections, he had the good fortune to po&s;&s;e&s;s entirely the good will of his fellow citizens. No character &s;tood fairer in the public eye for integrity, bravery and patrioti&s;m. He was employed in &s;everal offices in his own town, and not unfrequently elected to repre&s;ent it in the General A&s;|&s;embly. The year after his return to private life, the minds of men were &s;trangely agitated, by an attempt of
<PB N="253" REF="022578_0254_0FB9998EB422F450">
the Briti&s;h Parliament, to introduce the memorable Stamp Act in America. This germe policy, who&s;e growth was repre&s;&s;ed by the moderate temperature in which it was kept by &s;ome admini&s;trations, did not fully di&s;clo&s;e its fruit until nearly eleven years after|wards. All the world knows how it then ripened into a civil war.</P>
<P>ON the twenty-&s;econd day of March 1765, the Stamp Act received the royal a&s;&s;ent. It was to take place in America on the fir&s;t day of November following. This innovation &s;pread a &s;udden and univer&s;al alarm. The political pul&s;e in the Provinces, from <HI>Main</HI> to <HI>Georgia</HI> throbbed in &s;ympathy. The A&s;&s;emblies, in mo&s;t of the&s;e colonies, that they might oppo&s;e it legally and in con|cert, appointed Delegates to confer together on the &s;ub|ject. This fir&s;t Congre&s;s met, early in October, at New|York. They agreed upon a Declaration of Rights and Grievances of the Coloni&s;ts; together with &s;eparate Ad|dre&s;&s;es to the King, Lords, and Commons of Great Bri|tain. In the mean time, the people had determined, in order to prevent the &s;tamped paper from being di&s;tribut|ed, that the Stamp Ma&s;ters &s;hould not enter on the ex|ecution of their office. That appointment, in Connecti|cut, had been conferred upon Mr. Inger&s;ol, a very dig|nified, &s;en&s;ible and learned native of the colony, who, upon being &s;olicited to re&s;ign, did not, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, give a &s;ati&s;factory an&s;wer. In con&s;equence of which, a great number of the &s;ub&s;tantial yeomanry, on hor&s;eback, furni&s;hed with provi&s;ions for them&s;elves, and provender for their hor&s;es, a&s;&s;embled in the ea&s;tern counties, and began their march for New|Haven to receive the re&s;ig|nation

of Mr. Inger&s;ol. A junction with another body was to have been formed in Branford. But having learn|ed at Hartford, that Mr. Inger&s;ol would be in town the next day to claim protection from the A&s;&s;embly, they took quarters there and kept out patroles during the whole night, to prevent his arrival without their know|ledge. The &s;ucceeding morning they re&s;umed their march and met Mr. Inger&s;ol in Wethersfield. They told him their bu&s;ine&s;s, and he, after &s;ome little he&s;ita|tion, mounted on a round table, read his re&s;ignation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The curious may be plea&s;ed to know that the Re&s;ignation was expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e explicit terms:</P>

<P>COLONEL Putnam, who in&s;tigated the people to the&s;e mea&s;ures, was prevented from attending by accident.

<P>SUCH unanimity in the Provincial A&s;&s;emblies, and de|ci&s;ion in the yeomanry, carried beyond the Atlantic, a conviction of the inexpediency of attempting to enforce the new Revenue Sy&s;tem. The Stamp Act being re|pealed, and the mea&s;ures in a manner quieted, Colonel Putnam continued to labor with his own hands, at farm|ing, without interruption, except (for a little time) by the lo&s;s of the fir&s;t joint of his right thumb from one ac|cident, and the compound fracture of his right thigh from another&mdash;that thigh, being rendered nearly an inch &s;horter than the left, occa&s;ioned him ever to limp in his walk.</P>
<P>THE Provincial Officers and Soldiers from Connecti|cut, who &s;urvived the conque&s;t of the Havannah, ap|pointed General Lyman to receive the remainder to their prize-money, in England.

Lyman, with Colonel Putnam, and two or three others went to explore the &s;ituation. After a tedious voyage, and a laborious pa&s;&s;age up the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, they accompli&s;hed their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>GENERAL Lyman came back to Connecticut with the Explorers, but &s;oon returned to the Natchez: theer form|ed an E&s;tabli&s;hment and laid his bones. Colonel Put|nam placed &s;ome laborers with provi&s;ions and farming uten&s;ils upon his location, but the encrea&s;ing troubles &s;hortly after ruined the pro&s;pect of deriving any advan|tage from that quarter.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking of the troubles that en&s;ued, I not only omit to &s;ay any thing, on the obnoxious claim a&s;&s;erted in the Briti&s;h declaratory act, the continuation of the duty on tea, the attempt to obtrude that article upon the Americans, the abortion of this project, the Bo&s;ton Port Bill, the alteration of the charter of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and other to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ics of univer&s;al notoriety; but even wave all di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of irritations on the one part, and &s;uppli|cations on the other, which preceded the war between Great-Britain and her colonies on this continent. It will ever be acknowledged by tho&s;e who were be&s;t ac|quainted with facts, and it &s;hould be made known to po|&s;terity, that the king of England had not, in his exten|&s;ive dominions, &s;ubjects more loyal, more dutiful, or more zealous for his glory than the Americans; and that nothing &s;hort of a melancholy per&s;ua&s;ion, that the <Q>mea&s;ures which for many years had been &s;y&s;tematical|ly pur&s;ued, by his mini&s;ters, were calculated to &s;ub|vert, their con&s;titutions,</Q> could have di&s;&s;olved their

powerful attachment to that kingdom, which they fond|ly called their <HI>parent country.</HI> Here, without digre&s;&s;ion to develope the cau&s;e, or de&s;cribe the progre&s;s, it may &s;uffice to ob&s;erve, the di&s;pute now verged precipitately to an awful cri&s;is. Mo&s;t con&s;iderate men fore&s;aw it would terminate in blood. But, rather than &s;uffer the chains (which they believed in preparation) to be rivetted, they nobly determined to &s;acrifice their lives. In vain did they deprecate the infatuation of tho&s;e tran&s;atlantic coun&s;els which drove them to deeds of de&s;peration. Convinced of the rectitude of their cau&s;e, and doubtful of the i&s;&s;ue, they felt the mo&s;t painful &s;olicitude for the fate of their country, on contemplating the &s;uperior &s;trength of the nation with which it was to contend. America, thinly inhabited, under thirteen di&s;tinct colo|nial governments, could have little hope of &s;ucce&s;s, but from the protection of Providence and the unconquera|ble &s;pirit of freedom which pervaded the ma&s;s of the people: it is true, &s;ince the peace, &s;he had &s;urpri&s;ingly encrea&s;ed in wealth and population&mdash;but the re&s;ources of Britain almo&s;t exceeded credibility or conception. It is not wonderful then, that &s;ome good citizens, of weak|er nerves, recoiled at the pro&s;pect: while others, who had been officers in the late war, or who had witne&s;&s;ed by travelling, the force of Britain, &s;tood aloof. All eyes were now turned to find the men, who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of mi|litary experience, would dare, in the approaching hour of &s;evere&s;t trial, to lead their undi&s;ciplined fellow-citi|zens to battle. For none were &s;o &s;tupid as not to com|prehend, that want of &s;ucce&s;s would involve the leaders in the puni&s;hment of rebellion. Putnam was among the fir&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;picuous who &s;tepped forth. Although
<PB N="260" REF="022578_0260_0FB9999DC3EBB920">
the Americans had been, by many who wi&s;hed their &s;ubjugation, indi&s;creetly as indi&s;criminately &s;tigmatized with the imputation of cowardice&mdash;he felt&mdash;he knew for him&s;elf, he was no coward; and from what he had &s;een and known, he believed that his countrymen, dri|ven to the extremity of defending their rights by arms, would find no difficulty in wiping away the ungenerous a&s;per&s;ion. As he happened to be often at Bo&s;ton, he held many conver&s;ations on the&s;e &s;ubjects with General Gage, the Briti&s;h Commander in Chief, Lord Piercy, Colonel Sheriff, Colonel Small, and many officers with whom he had formerly &s;erved, who were now at the Head Quarters. Being often que&s;tioned, <Q>in ca&s;e the di&s;pute &s;hould proceed to ho&s;tilities, what part he would really take?</Q> He always an&s;wered, <Q>with his country, and that, let whatever might happen, he was prepared to abide the con&s;equence.</Q> Being interrogated <Q>whether <HI>he,</HI> who had been a witne&s;s to the prowe&s;s and victories of the Briti&s;h fleets and ar|mies, did not think them equal to the conque&s;t of a country which was not the owner of a &s;ingle Ship. Regiment or Magazine?</Q> He rejoined, that <Q>he could only &s;ay, ju&s;tice would be on our &s;ide, and the e|vent with Providence: but that he had calculated if it required &s;ix years for the combined forces of Eng|land and her Colonies to conquer &s;uch a feeble coun|try as Canada; it would at lea&s;t, take a very long time for England alone to overcome her own widely extended Colonies, which were much &s;tronger than Canada: That when men &s;ought for every thing dear, in what they believed to be the mo&s;t &s;acred of all cau&s;es, and in their own native land; they would have
<PB N="261" REF="022578_0261_0FB999A347B7A1B8">
great advantages over their enemies, who were not in the &s;ame &s;ituation; and that, having taken into view all circum&s;tances, for his own part, he fully believed that America would not be &s;o ea&s;ily conquered by England as tho&s;e gentlemen &s;eemed to expect.</Q> Be|ing once, in particular, a&s;ked, <Q>whether he did not &s;eriou&s;ly believe that a well appointed Briti&s;h army of five thou&s;and veterans could march through the whole continent of America? He replied bri&s;kly,&mdash;no doubt, if they behaved civilly and paid well for every thing they wanted</Q>&mdash;"but"&mdash;after a moment's pau&s;e added&mdash;<Q>if they &s;hould attempt it in a ho&s;tile manner (though the American men were out of the que&s;tion) the women, with their laddles and broom|&s;ticks, would knock them all on the head before they had got half way through.</Q> This was the tenor, our hero hath often told me of the&s;e amicable inter|views. And thus, (as it commonly happens in di&s;putes about future events, which depend on opinion) they parted without conviction: no more to meet in a friend|ly manner, until after the appeal &s;hould have been made to Heaven, and the i&s;&s;ue confirmed by the &s;word. In the mean time, to provide again&s;t the wor&s;t contingen|cy, the militia in the &s;everal Colonies was &s;edulou&s;ly trained; and tho&s;e &s;elect companies, the flower of our youth, which were denominated minutemen, agreeably to the indication of their name, held them&s;elves in rea|dine&s;s to march at a moment's warning.</P>
<P>AT length the fatal day arrived, when ho&s;tilities com|menced. General Gage, in the evening of the 18th of April, 1775, detached from Bo&s;ton the Grenadiers and
<PB N="262" REF="022578_0262_0FB999AA6653CC50">
Light Infantry of the Army, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Smith, to de&s;troy &s;ome military and other &s;tores depo&s;ited by the Province at Concord. About &s;unri&s;e the next morning, the Detachment, on marching into Lexington, fired upon a company of militia who had ju&s;t re-a&s;&s;embled: for having been alarmed late at night, with reports that the Regulars were advancing to de|moli&s;h the &s;tores, they collected on their parade, and were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with orders to re-a&s;&s;emble at beat of drum. It is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the affidavits of more than thirty per&s;ons who were pre&s;ent, that the fir&s;t fire, which killed eight of the militia, then beginning to di&s;per&s;e, was given by the Briti&s;h, without provocation. The &s;park of war, thus kindled, ran with unexampled rapi|dity, and raged with unwonted violence. To repel the aggre&s;&s;ion, the people of the bordering towns &s;pontane|ou&s;ly ru&s;hed to arms, and poured their &s;cattering &s;hot from every convenient &s;tation upon the Regulars; who, after marching to Concord, and de&s;troying the Maga|zine, would have found their retreat intercepted, had they not been reinforced by Lord Piercy with the bat|talion companies of three regiments, and a body of ma|rines. Notwith&s;tanding the junction, they were hard pu&s;hed, and pur&s;ued until they could find protection from their &s;hips. Of the Briti&s;h, two hundred and eigh|ty-three were killed, wounded and taken. The Ame|ricans had thirty-nine killed, nineteen wounded, and two made pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>NOTHING could exceed the celerity with which the intelligence flew every where, that blood had been &s;hed by the Briti&s;h troops. The country, in motion, ex|hibited but one &s;cene of hurry, preparation, and revenge.

Putnam, who was plowing when he heard the news, left his plough in the middle of the field, unyoked his team, and without waiting to change his clothes, &s;et off for the theatre of action. But finding the Briti&s;h re|treated to Bo&s;ton, and inve&s;ted by a &s;ufficient force to watch their movements, he came back to Connecticut, levied a regiment (under authority of the Legi&s;lature) and &s;peedily returned to Cambridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>An article, void of foundation, mentioning an interview between General Gage and General Putnam appeared in the Engli&s;h Gazettes, in the&s;e words: <Q>General Gage, viewing the American army with his tele&s;cope, &s;aw General Putnam in it, which &s;urpri&s;ed him; and he contrived to get a me&s;&s;age delivered to him, that he wanted to &s;peak to him.

Though the Commanding Officers from the four colonies of New-England, were in a man|ner independent, they acted harmoniou&s;ly in concert. The fir&s;t attention had been prudently directed towards forming &s;ome little redoubts and intrenchments; for it was well known, that lines, however &s;light or untenable, were calculated to in&s;pire raw &s;oldiers with a confidence in them&s;elves. The next care was to bring the live &s;tock from the I&s;lands in Bo&s;ton bay, in order to pre|vent the enemy (already &s;urrounded by land) from mak|ing u&s;e of them for fre&s;h provi&s;ions. In the latter end of May, between two and three hundred men were &s;ent to drive off the &s;tock from Hog and Noddle I&s;lands, which are &s;ituated on the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of Bo&s;ton har|bor. Advantage having been taken of the ebb-tide,

when the water is fordable between the main and Hog-I&s;land, as it is between that and Noddle-I&s;land the de&s;ign was effected. But a &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;ued, in which &s;ome of the marines, who had been &s;tationed to guard them, were killed: and as the firing continu|ed between the Briti&s;h water-craft and our party, a re|inforcement of three hundred men, with two pieces of artillery, was ordered to join the latter. General Put|nam took the command, and having him&s;elf gone down on the beach, within conver&s;ing di&s;tance, and <HI>ineffectually</HI> ordered the people on board an armed &s;chooner to &s;trike, he plied her with &s;hot &s;o furiou&s;ly that the crew made their e&s;cape, and the ve&s;&s;el was burnt. An armed &s;loop was likewi&s;e &s;o much di&s;abled as to be towed off by the boats of the fleet. Thus ended this affair, in which &s;everal hundred &s;heep, and &s;ome cattle were removed from under the muzzles of the enemy's cannon, and our men, accu&s;tomed to &s;tand fire, by being for many hours expo&s;ed to it, without meeting with any lo&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Provincial Generals, having received advice, that the Briti&s;h Commander in Chief, de&s;igned to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights on the penin&s;ula of Charles Town, detached a thou&s;and men in the night of the 16th of June, under the orders of General Warren, to entrench them&s;elves upon one of the&s;e eminences, named Bunker Hill. Though retarded by accidents, from be|ginning the work until nearly midnight, yet, by dawn of day, they had con&s;tructed a redoubt about eight rods &s;quare, and commenced a brea&s;t-work from the left to the low grounds: which an in&s;ufferable fire from the &s;hip|ping, floating batteries, and cannon on Cop's Hill, in Bo&s;ton, prevented them from compleating. At mid-day
<PB N="267" REF="022578_0267_0FB999B8AE0D5650">
four battalions of foot, ten companies of Grenadiers, ten companies of Light Infantry, with a proportion of Ar|tillery, commanded by Major General Howe, landed under a heavy cannonade from the &s;hips, and advanced in three lines to the attack. The Light Infantry, being formed on their right, was directed to turn the left flank of the Americans: and the Grenadiers, &s;upported by two battalions, to &s;torm the redoubt in front. Mean|while, on application, the&s;e troops were augmented by the 47th Regiment, the 1&s;t Battalion of Marines, toge|ther with &s;ome companies of Light Infantry, and Gre|nadiers, which formed an aggregate force of between two and three thou&s;and men. But &s;o difficult was it to reinforce the Americans, by &s;ending detachments a|cro&s;s the Neck, which was raked by the cannon of the &s;hipping, that not more than fifteen hundred men were brought into action. Few in&s;tances can be produced in the annals of mankind, where &s;oldiers, who never had before faced an enemy, or heard the whi&s;tling of a ball, behaved with &s;uch deliberate and per&s;evering valor. It was not until after the Grenadiers had been twice repul|&s;ed to their boats, General Warren &s;lain, his troops ex|hau&s;ted of their ammunition, their lines in a manner en|filaded by Artillery, and the redoubt half filled with Briti&s;h Regulars, that the word was given to retire. In that forlorn condition, the &s;pectacle was a&s;toni&s;hing as new, to behold the&s;e undi&s;ciplined men, mo&s;t of them without bayonets, di&s;puting with the butt end of their mu&s;quets again&s;t the Briti&s;h bayonet, and receding in &s;ullen de&s;pair. Still the Light Infantry, on their left, would certainly have gained their rear, and exterminat|ed this gallant corps, had not a body of four hundred

Connecticut men, with the Captains, Knoulton and Che&s;ter, after forming a temporary brea&s;t-work, by pul|ling up one po&s;t and rail fence, and putting it upon ano|ther, performed prodigies of bravery. They held the enemy at bay, until the main body had relinqui&s;hed the heights, and then retreated acro&s;s the Neck, with more re|gularity, and le&s;s lo&s;s than could have been expected. The Briti&s;h, who effected nothing but the de&s;truction of Charles Town, by a wanton conflagration, had more than one half of their whole number killed and wound|ed: the Americans, only three hundred and fifty-five kill|ed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing. In this battle, the pre&s;ence and example of General Putnam, who arrived with the re|inforcement, were not le&s;s con&s;picuous than u&s;eful. He did every thing that an intrepid and experienced officer could accompli&s;h. The enemy pur&s;ued to Winter Hill&mdash;Putnam made a &s;tand, and drove them back under cover of their &s;hips.</P>
<P>THE premature death of Warren, one of the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious patriots that ever bled in the cau&s;e of Free|dom; the veteran appearance of Putnam, collected, yet ardent in action; together with the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenery and intere&s;ting groupe around Bunker Hill, rendered this a magnificent &s;ubject for the hi&s;toric pencil. Ac|cordingly Trumbull, formerly an Aid-de-Camp to Ge|neral Wa&s;hington, afterwards Deputy Adjutant General of the northern Army, now an arti&s;t of great celebrity in Europe, hath fini&s;hed this picture with that boldne&s;s of conception, and tho&s;e touches of art which demon|&s;trates the ma&s;ter.

<P>AFTER this action, the Briti&s;h &s;trongly fortified them|&s;elves on the Penin&s;ulas of Bo&s;ton and Charles Town:
<PB N="270" REF="022578_0270_0FB999BF713970C0">
while the Provincials remained po&s;ted in the circumja|cent country in &s;uch manner as to form a blockade. In the beginning of July, General Wa&s;hington, who had been, con&s;tituted by Congre&s;s, Commander in Chief of the American forces, arrived at Cambridge to take the command. Having formed the army into three grand divi&s;ions, con&s;i&s;ting of about twelve Regiments each, he appointed Major General Ward to command the right Wing, Major General Lee the left Wing and Major Ge|neral Putnam the re&s;erve. General Putnam's alertne&s;s, in accelerating the con&s;truction of the nece&s;&s;ary defences, was particularly noticed and highly approved by the Commander in Chief.</P>
<P>About the 20th of July, the declaration of Congre&s;s &s;etting forth the rea&s;ons of their taking up arms, was proclaimed at the head of the &s;everal divi&s;ions. It con|cluded with the&s;e patriotic and noble &s;entiments, <Q>In our own native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birth-right, and which we ever enjoyed until the late violation of it; for the protection of our pro|perty, acquired &s;olely by the hone&s;t indu&s;try of our forefathers and our&s;elves; again&s;t violence actually

<P><Q>With an humble confidence in the mercies of the &s;upreme and impartial Judge and Ruler of the Uni|ver&s;e, we mo&s;t devoutly implore his divine goodne&s;s to conduct us happily through this great conflict, to di&s;po&s;e our adver&s;aries to reconciliation on rea&s;onable terms, and, thereby, to relieve the empire from the calamities of civil war.</Q>&mdash;As &s;oon as the&s;e memorable words were pronounced to General Putnam's Divi&s;ion, which he had ordered to be paraded on Pro&s;pect Hill, they &s;houted in three huzzas aloud, amen! Whereat (a cannon from the Fort being fired as a &s;ignal) the new <HI>Standard,</HI> lately &s;ent from Connecticut, was &s;uddenly &s;een to ri&s;e and unrol it&s;elf to the wind. On one &s;ide was in&s;cribed in large letters of gold, "AN APPEAL TO HEAVEN," and on the other, were delineated the armo|rial bearings of Connecticut, which, without &s;upporters or cre&s;t, con&s;i&s;t, uno&s;tentatiou&s;ly, of <HI>Three Vines:</HI> with this motto, "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Literally, <HI>"He who tran&s;planted them will &s;upport them,"</HI></NOTE> <HI>"Qui tran&s;tulit, &s;u&s;tinet;"</HI> alluding to the pi|ous confidence our forefathers placed in the protection of Heaven, on tho&s;e three allegorical Scions&mdash;KNOW|LEDGE&mdash;LIBERTY&mdash;RELIGION&mdash;which they had been in&s;trumental in tran&s;planting to America.</P>
<P>THE &s;trength of po&s;ition on the enemy's part, and want of ammunition on ours, prevented operations of magni|tude from being attempted. Such diligence was u&s;ed in
<PB N="272" REF="022578_0272_0FB999C70007B4A8">
fortifying our camps, and &s;uch precaution adopted to pre|vent &s;urprize, as to en&s;ure tranquillity to the troops during the winter. In the &s;pring, a po&s;ition was taken &s;o menacing to the enemy, as to cau&s;e them, on the 17th of March 1776, to abandon Bo&s;ton: not without con&s;i|derable precipitation and dereliction of royal &s;tores.</P>
<P>As a part of the ho&s;tile fleet lingered for &s;ome time in Nanta&s;ket road (about nine miles below Bo&s;ton) Ge|neral Wa&s;hington continued him&s;elf in Bo&s;ton, not only to &s;ee the coa&s;t entirely clear, but al&s;o to make many indi&s;pen&s;able arrangements. His Excellency, propo&s;ing to leave Major General Ward with a few regiments, to fini&s;h the fortifications intended as a &s;ecurity again&s;t an attack by water, in the mean time di&s;patched the great|er part of the army to New-York, where it was mo&s;t probable the enemy would make a de&s;cent. Upon the &s;ailing of a fleet with troops in the month of January, Major General Lee had been &s;ent to the defence of that city; who, after having cau&s;ed &s;ome works to be laid out, proceeded to follow that fleet to South-Carolina. The Commander in Chief was now exceedingly &s;olicit|ous that the&s;e works &s;hould be completed as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible, and accordingly gave the following</P>

NEARLY at the &s;ame moment, a detachment of a thou and Continentals was &s;ent to occupy Governor's-I&s;land, a Regiment to fortify Red Hook, and &s;ome companies of Riflemen to the Jer&s;ey &s;hore.

About Chri&s;tmas, 1777, he committed to the Delaware a num|ber of kegs, de&s;tined to fall among the Briti&s;h fleet at Phila|delphia: but his &s;quadron of kegs, having been &s;eparated and retarded by the ice, demoli&s;hed but a &s;ingle boat. This cata&s;|trophe, however, produced an alarm, unprecedented in its na|ture and degree; which has been &s;o happily de&s;cribed in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ong, by the Hon. Francis Hopkin&s;on, that the e|vent it celebrates will not be forgotten, &s;o long as mankind &s;hall continue to be delighted with works of humour and ta&s;te.</P>

who, having received whatever in&s;tructions could be communicated to him in a &s;hort time, (went too late in the night) with all the apparatus under the bottom of the Eagle, a &s;ixty-four gun &s;hip, on board of which the Briti&s;h Admiral, Lord Howe, commanded. In coming up, the &s;crew, that had been calculated to perforate the copper &s;heathing, unluckily &s;truck again&s;t &s;ome iron plates, where the rudder is connected with the &s;tern. This accident, added to the &s;trength of tide, which pre|vailed, and the want of adequate &s;kill in the &s;erjeant, oc|ca&s;ioned &s;uch delay, that the dawn began to appear, whereupon he abandoned the Magazine to chance, and (after gaining a proper di&s;tance) for the &s;ake of expedi|tion, rowed on the &s;urface towards the town. General Putnam, who had been on the wharf, anxiou&s;ly expect|ing the re&s;ult, from the fir&s;t glimmering of light, beheld the machine near Governor's I&s;land, and &s;ent a whale|boat
<PB N="284" REF="022578_0284_0FB999ECE7F05998">
to bring it on &s;hore. In about twenty minutes af|terwards, the magazine exploded, and blew a va&s;t co|lumn of water, to an amazing height, in the air. As the whole bu&s;ine&s;s had been kept an inviolable &s;ecret, he was not a little diverted with the various conjectures, whether this &s;tupendous noi&s;e was produced by a bomb, a meteor, a water-&s;pout, or an earthquake. Other operations of a mo&s;t &s;erious nature, rapidly &s;ucceeded and prevented a repetition of the experiment.</P>
<P>ON the twenty-&s;econd day of Augu&s;t the van of the Briti&s;h landed on Long-I&s;land, and was &s;oon followed by the whole army, except one Brigade of He&s;&s;ians, a &s;mall body of Briti&s;h, and &s;ome convale&s;cents, left on Staten-I&s;land. Our troops on Long-I&s;land had been command|ed during the &s;ummer by General Greene, who was now &s;ick; and General Putnam took the command, but two days before the battle of Flatbu&s;h. The in&s;tructions to him (pointing in the fir&s;t place to deci&s;ive expedients for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;cattering, unmeaning and wa&s;teful fire of our men) contained regulations for the &s;ervice of the guards, the Brigadiers and the Field officers of the day; for the appointment and encouragement of proper &s;couts; as well as for keeping the men con&s;tantly at their po&s;ts; for preventing the burning of buildings (except it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for military purpo&s;es) and for pre&s;erving private property from pillage and de|&s;truction. To the&s;e regulations were added, in a more diffu&s;e though not le&s;s &s;pirited and profe&s;&s;ional &s;tyle, re|flections on the di&s;tinction of an army from a mob; with exhortations for the &s;oldiers to conduct them&s;elves man|fully in &s;uch a cau&s;e, and for their Commander to op|po&s;e

the enemy's approach with detatchments of his be&s;t troops: while he &s;hould endeavor to render their advance more difficult by con&s;tructing abbattis, and to entrap their parties by forming ambu&s;cades. General Putnam was within the lines, when an engagement took place on the 27th, between the Briti&s;h army and our advanced Corps, in which we lo&s;t about a thou&s;and men in killed and mi&s;&s;ing, with the General Sullivan and Lord Sterling made pri&s;oners. But our men (though attacked on all &s;ides) fought with great bravery; and the enemy's lo&s;s was not light.</P>
<P>THE unfortunate battle of Long-I&s;land, the ma&s;terly retreat from thenoe, and the actual pa&s;&s;age of part of the ho&s;tile fleet in the Ea&s;t River above the town, precluded the evacuation of New-York. A promotion of four Majors General, and &s;ix Brigadiers, had previou&s;ly been made by Congre&s;s. After the retreat from Long-I&s;land, the main army, con&s;i&s;ting for the moment, of &s;ixty Bat|talions (of which twenty were Continental, the re&s;idue Levies and Militia) was, conformably to the exigencies of the &s;ervice, rather than to the rules of war, formed in|to fourteen Brigades. Major General Putnam com|manded the right grand Divi&s;ion of five Brigades, the Majors General Spencer and Greene the center of &s;ix Brigades, and Major General Heath the left, which was po&s;ted near King&s;bridge, and compo&s;ed of two Brigades. The whole never amounted to twenty thou&s;and effective men; while the Briti&s;h and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> forces under Sir William Howe, exceeded twenty-two thou&s;and: indeed the Mini&s;ter had a&s;&s;erted in Parliament, that they would con&s;i&s;t of more than thirty thou&s;and. Our two center

divi&s;ions, both commanded by General Spencer in the &s;ickne&s;s of General Greene, moved towards Mount Wa&s;hington, Harlem Heights and Horn's Hook, as &s;oon as the final re&s;olution was taken, in a Council of War, on the twelfth of September, to abandon the city. That event, thus circum&s;tanced, took effect a few days after.</P>
<P>ON Sunday the fifteenth the Briti&s;h, after &s;ending three &s;hips of war up the North River to Bloomingdale, and keeping up, for &s;ome hours, a &s;evere cannonade on our lines, from tho&s;e already in the Ea&s;t River, landed in force at Turtle Bay&mdash;our new Levies commanded by a &s;tate Brigadier General, fled without making re&s;i&s;t|ance. Two Brigades of General Putnam's Divi&s;ion, or|dered to their &s;upport, notwith&s;tanding the exertion of their Brigadiers, and of the Commander in Chief him|&s;elf, who came up at the in&s;tant, conducted them&s;elves in the &s;ame &s;hameful manner. His Excellency then ordered the Heights of Harlem, a &s;trong po&s;ition, to be occupied. Thither the forces in the vicinity, as well as the fugitives, repaired. In the mean time Ge|neral Putnam, with the remainder of his command and the ordinary out-po&s;ts, was in the city. After having cau&s;ed the Brigades to begin their retreat by the rout of Bloomingdale, in order to avoid the enemy, who were then in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the main road leading to King&s;bridge, he galloped to call off the pickets and guards. Having my&s;elf been a Volunteer in his Divi|&s;ion, and acting Adjutant to the la&s;t Regiment that left the city, I had frequent opportunities that day of be|holding him, for the purpo&s;e of i&s;&s;uing orders and en|couraging

the troops, flying, on his hor&s;e covered with foam, wherever his pre&s;ence was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary. With|out his extraordinary exertions the guards mu&s;t have been inevitably lo&s;t, and it is probable the entire Corps would have been cut in pieces. When we were not far from Bloomingdale, an Aid-de-Camp came from him at full &s;peed, to inform, that a column of Briti&s;h Infantry was de&s;cending upon our right. Our rear was &s;oon fired upon, and the Colonel of our regiment (who&s;e order was ju&s;t communicated for the front to file off to the left) was killed on the &s;pot. With no other lo&s;s, we joined the army, after dark, on the Heights of Harlem.</P>
<P>BEFORE our Brigades came in, we were given up for lo&s;t by all our friends. So critical indeed was our &s;itu|ation, and &s;o narrow the gap by which we e&s;caped, that the in&s;tant we had pa&s;&s;ed, the enemy clo&s;ed it by ex|tending their line from river to river. Our men, who had been fifteen hours under arms, harra&s;&s;ed by march|ing and countermarching, in con&s;equence of ince&s;&s;ant a|larms, exhau&s;ted as they were by heat, and thir&s;t (for the day proved in&s;upportably hot, and few or none had canteens, in&s;omuch that &s;ome died at the brooks where they drank) if attacked, could have made but feeble re|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>IF we take into con&s;ideration the debilitating &s;ickne&s;s which weakened almo&s;t all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> troops, the hard duty by which they were worn down in con&s;tructing num|berle&s;s defences, the continual want of re&s;t they had &s;uffered (&s;ince the enemy landed) in guarding from noc|turnal &s;urprize, the de&s;pondency infu&s;ed into their

minds by an in&s;ular &s;ituation, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inferiority to the enemy in di&s;cipline, together with the di&s;advantageous term upon which, in their &s;tate of &s;epa|ration, they might have been forced to engage; it ap|pears highly probable that day would have pre&s;ented an ea&s;y victory to the Briti&s;h. On the other &s;ide, the Ame|rican Commander in Chief had wi&s;ely countenanced an opinion, then univer&s;ally credited, that our army was three times more numerous than it was in reality. It is not a &s;ubject for a&s;toni&s;hment, that the Briti&s;h, ignorant of the exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, impo&s;ed upon as to the numbers by reports, and recollecting what a few brave men, &s;lightly entrenched, had performed at Bunker Hill, &s;hould proceed with great circum&s;pection. For their reproaches, that the Rebels (as they affected to &s;tyle us) loved digging better than fighting, and that they earthed them&s;elves in holes like foxes, but ill concealed at the bottom of their own hearts the profound impre&s;&s;ion that action had made. Cheap and contemptible as we had once &s;eemed in their eyes, it had taught them to hold us in &s;ome re&s;pect. This re&s;pect, in conjunction with a fixed belief that the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit of our oppo&s;ition mu&s;t &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide, and that the inexhau&s;tible re&s;ources of Britain would ultimately triumph without leaving any thing to chance (not the avarice or treachery of the Bri|ti&s;h General, as the factious of his own nation wi&s;hed to in&s;inuate) retarded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eir operation, and afforded us lei|&s;ure to re&s;cue from annihilation the mi&s;erable relics of an army, ha&s;tening to di&s;&s;olution, by the expiration of enli&s;tments, and the country it&s;elf from irretrievable &s;ubjugtaion.

<P>THAT night our &s;oldiers, exce&s;&s;ively fatigued by the &s;ultry march of the day, their cloaths wet by a &s;evere &s;hower of rain that &s;ucceeded towards the evening, their blood chilled by the cold wind that produced a &s;udden change in the temperature of the air, and their hearts &s;unk within them by the lo&s;s of baggage, artillery, and works in which they had been taught to put great con|fidence, lay upon their arms, covered only by the clouds of an uncomfortable &s;ky. To retrieve our di&s;ordered af|fairs, and prevent the enemy from profiting by them, no exertion was relaxed, no vigilance remitted on the part of our higher officers.

The warmth of enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;eemed to be ex|tingui&s;hed. The force of di&s;cipline had not &s;ufficiently occupied its place to give men a dependence upon each other.

General Wa&s;hington rode quickly to the out|po&s;ts, for the purpo&s;e of preparing again&s;t an attack, if the enemy &s;hould advance with that de&s;ign. Lieutenant Colonel Knowlton's Rangers (a fine &s;election from the ea&s;tern Regiments), who had been &s;kirmi&s;hing with an advanced party, came in and informed the General that a body of Briti&s;h were under cover of a &s;mall eminence at no con&s;iderable di&s;tance. His Excellency, willing to rai&s;e our men from their dejection by the &s;plendor of &s;ome little &s;ucce&s;s, ordered Lieutenant Colonel Knowl|ton with his Rangers, and Major Leitch with three Companies of Weedon's Regiment of Virginians, to gain their rear; while appearance &s;hould be made of an at|tack in front. As &s;oon as the enemy &s;aw the party &s;ent to decoy them, they ran precipitately down the hill, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome fences and bu&s;hes, and commenced a bri&s;k firing at long &s;hot. Unfortunately Knowlton and Leitch made their on&s;et rather in flank than in rear. The enemy changed their front, and the &s;kirmi&s;h at once became clo&s;e and warm. Major<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Major Leitch, after langui&s;hing &s;ome days, died of a locked jaw.</NOTE> Leitch having received three balls through his &s;ide was &s;oon borne from the field, and Colonel Knowlton (who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o gallantly at the battle of Bunker-Hill) was mortally wounded immediately after.

Among the troops not engaged, who during the action were throwing earth from the new trenches, with an alacrity that indicated a determination to defend them, every vi&s;age was &s;een to brighten, and to a&s;&s;ume, in|&s;tead of the gloom of de&s;pair, the glow of animation. This change, no le&s;s &s;udden than happy, left little room to doubt that the men, who ran the day before at the &s;ight of an enemy, would now (to wipe away the &s;tain of that di&s;grace, and to recover the confidence of their General) have conducted them&s;elves in a very different manner. Some alteration was made in the di&s;tribution of Corps to prevent the Briti&s;h from gaining either flank in the &s;ucceeding night. General Putnam, who com|manded on the right, was directed in orders, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould attempt to force the pa&s;s, to apply for a reinforcement to General Spencer, who commanded on the left.</P>

GENERAL PUTNAM, who was too good a hu&s;band|man him&s;elf, not to have a re&s;pect for the labors and improvements of others, &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;econded the views of the Commander in Chief in preventing the deva&s;ta|tion of Farms, and the violation of private property.

The &s;ame policy of keeping our army as compact as po&s;|&s;ible; the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of avoiding being forced to ac|tion; and the &s;ame precaution to prevent the interrup|tion of &s;upplies, reinforcements or retreat, that lately dictated the evacuation of New-York, now induced Ge|neral Wa&s;hington to move towards the &s;trong grounds in the upper part of We&s;t Che&s;ter County.</P>

accidental fires, advancing the public works, as well as in regard to other important objects were perfect|ly military and proper. But his health was, for a while, impaired by his unrelaxed exertions.</P>
<P>THE Commander in Chief, having in &s;pite of all ob|&s;tacles made good his retreat over the Delaware, wrote to General Putnam (from his Camp above the Falls of Trenton, on the very day he recro&s;&s;ed the river to &s;ur|pri&s;e the He&s;&s;ians) expre&s;&s;ing his &s;ati&s;faction at the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of that General's health, and informing, that, if he had not him&s;elf been well convinced before of the enemy's intention to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of Phila|delphia, as &s;oon as the fro&s;t &s;hould form ice &s;trong e|nough to tran&s;port them and their artillery acro&s;s the Delaware, he had now obtained an intercepted letter which placed the matter beyond a doubt. He added, that, if the citizens of Philadelphia had any regard for the town, not a moment's time was to be lo&s;t until it &s;hould be put in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible po&s;ture of defence; but lea&s;t that &s;hould not be done, he directed the removal

of all public &s;tores, except provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for imme|diate u&s;e, to places of greater &s;ecurity. He queried whether, if a party of Militia could be &s;ent from Philadelphia to &s;upport tho&s;e in the Jer&s;eys about Mount Holly, it would not &s;erve to &s;ave them from &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? At the &s;ame time, he &s;ignified (as his opinion) the expediency of &s;ending an active and influential Officer to in&s;pirit the people, to encourage them to a&s;&s;emble in arms, as well as to keep tho&s;e already in arms from di&s;banding; and concluded by manife&s;ting a wi&s;h that Colonel For|man, whom he de&s;ired to &s;ee for this purpo&s;e, might be employed on the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE enemy had vainly, as incautiou&s;ly imagined that to over-run was to conquer. They had even carried their pre&s;umption on our extreme weakne&s;s and expect|ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, &s;o far as to attempt covering the country, through which they had marched, with an exten&s;ive chain of Cantonments. That link, which the po&s;t at Trenton &s;upplied, con&s;i&s;ted of a He&s;&s;ian brigade of In|fantry, a Company of Cha&s;&s;eurs, a Squadron of Light Dragoons and fix Field Pieces. At eight o'clock in the morning of the twenty-&s;ixth of December, Gene|ral Wa&s;hington, with twenty-four hundred men, came upon them (after they had paraded) took one thou&s;and pri&s;oners, and repa&s;&s;ed the &s;ame day without lo&s;s to his encampment. As &s;oon as the troops were recovered from their exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, General Wa&s;hington re|cro&s;&s;ed a &s;econd time to Trenton. On the &s;econd of January, Lord Cornwallis with the bulk of the Briti&s;h army advanced upon him, cannonaded his po&s;t, and of|fered him battle: but, the two armies being &s;eparated
<PB N="300" REF="022578_0300_0FB9955E3B09D888">
by the interpo&s;ition of Trenton Creek, General Wa&s;h|ington had it in his option to decline an engagement; which he did for the &s;ake of &s;triking the ma&s;terly &s;troke that he then meditated. Having kindled fre|quent fires around his camp, po&s;ted faithful men to keep them burning, and advanced centinels who&s;e fide|lity might be relied upon, he decamped &s;ilently after dark, and, by a circuitous route, reached Princeton at nine o'clock the next morning. The noi&s;e of the firing, by which he killed and captured between five and &s;ix hun|dred of the Briti&s;h Brigade in that town, was the fir&s;t notice Lord Cornwallis had of this &s;tolen march. Ge|neral Wa&s;hington, the project &s;ucce&s;sfully accompli&s;hed, in&s;tantly filed off for the mountainous grounds of Mor|ris Town. Meanwhile his Lord&s;hip, who arrived by a forced march at Princeton, ju&s;t as he had left it, finding the Americans could not be overtaken, pro|ceeded without halting to Brun&s;wick.</P>
<P>ON the fifth of January 1777, from Pluckemin, Ge|neral Wa&s;hington di&s;patched an account of this &s;econd &s;ucce&s;s to General Putnam, and ordered him to move im|mediately with all his troops to Cro&s;&s;wicks, for the pur|po&s;e of co-operating in recovering the Jer&s;eys: an event which the pre&s;ent fortunate juncture (while the enemy were yet panic-&s;truck) appeared to promi&s;e. The Ge|neral cautioned him, however, if the enemy &s;hould &s;till continue at Brun&s;wick, to guard with great circum|&s;pection again&s;t a &s;urpri&s;e: e&s;pecially, as they, having recently &s;uffered by two attacks, could &s;carely avoid being edged with re&s;entment to attempt retaliation. His Excellency farther advi&s;ed him to give out his

&s;trength to be twice as great as it was; to forward on all the baggage and &s;cattering men belonging to the Divi&s;ion de&s;tined for Morris Town; to employ as many &s;pies as he &s;hould think proper; to keep a number of hor&s;emen, in the dre&s;s of the country, going con&s;tantly backwards and forwards on the &s;ame &s;ecret &s;ervice; and la&s;tly, if he &s;hould di&s;cover any intention or motion of the enemy that could be depended upon and might be of con&s;equence, not to fail in conveying the intelligence as rapidly as po&s;&s;ible by expre&s;s to Head Quarters. Major General Putnam was directed &s;oon after to take po&s;t at Princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ton; where he continued until the &s;pring. He had never with him more than a few hundred troops, though he was only at fifteen miles di&s;tance from the enemy's &s;trong garri&s;on of Brun&s;wick. At one pe|riod, from a &s;udden diminution, occa&s;ioned by the tar|dine&s;s of the militia, turning out to replace tho&s;e who&s;e time of &s;ervice was expired, he had fewer men for duty than he had miles of frontier to guard. Nor was the Commander in Chief in a more eligible &s;ituation. It is true, that, while he had &s;carcely the &s;emblance of an army, under the &s;pecious parade of a park of artillery, and the impo&s;ing appearance of his Head Quarters, e|&s;tabli&s;hed at Morris Town, he kept up in the eyes of his countrymen, as well as in the opinion of his enemy, the appearance of no contemptible force. Future gene|rations will find difficulty in conceiving how a handful of new-levied Men and Militia, who were nece&s;&s;itated to be inoculated for the Small-Pox in the cour&s;e of the win|ter, could be &s;ubdivided and po&s;ted &s;o advantageou&s;ly, as, effectually to protect the inhabitants, confine the ene|my,

curtail their forage, and beat up their quarters, without &s;u&s;taining a &s;ingle di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>IN the battle of Princeton, Capt. M'Pher&s;on, of the 17th Briti&s;h Regiment, a very worthy Scotchman, was de&s;perately wounded in the lungs and left with the dead. Upon General Putnam's arrival there, he found him langui&s;hing in extreme di&s;tre&s;s, without a &s;urgeon, without a &s;ingle accommodation, and without a friend to &s;olace the &s;inking &s;pirit in the gloomy hour of death. He vi&s;ited and immediately cau&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible com|fort to be admini&s;tered to him. Captain M'Pher&s;on, who contrary to all appearances recovered, after having demon&s;trated to General Putnam the dignified &s;en&s;e of obligations which a generous mind wi&s;hes not to con|ceal, one day in familiar conver&s;ation demanded&mdash;<Q>pray, Sir, what countryman are you?&mdash;An American, an&s;wered the latter.&mdash;Not a Yankee?&mdash;&s;aid the other. A full-blooded one, replied the General. By G&mdash;d, I am &s;orry for that, rejoined M'Pher&s;on, I did not think there could be &s;o much goodne&s;s and genero&s;ity in an American, or, indeed in any body but a Scotchman.</Q></P>
<P>WHILE the recovery of Captain M'Pher&s;on was doubtful, he de&s;ired that General Putnam would per|mit a friend in the Briti&s;h army at Brun&s;wick to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in making HIS WILL. General Putnam, who had then only fifty men in his whole command, was &s;adly embarra&s;&s;ed by the propo&s;ition. On the one hand, he was not content that a Briti&s;h Officer &s;hould have an opportunity to &s;py out the weakne&s;s of his po&s;t,
<PB N="303" REF="022578_0303_0FB99562D5EDCCD0">
&mdash;on the other, it was &s;carcely in his nature to refu&s;e complying with a dictate of humanity. He luckily bethought him&s;elf of an expedient, which he ha&s;tened to put in practice. A Flag of Truce was di&s;patched with Captain M'Pher&s;on's reque&s;t, but under an injunc|tion not to return with his friend until after dark. In the evening, lights were placed in all the rooms of the College, and in every apartment of the vacant hou&s;es throughout the town. During the whole night, the fifty men, &s;ometimes all together and &s;ometimes in &s;mall de|tachments, were marched from different quarters by the hou&s;e in which M'Pher&s;on lay. Afterwards it was known, that the Officer who came on the vi&s;it at his re|turn reported, that General Putnam's Army upon the mo&s;t moderate calculation could not con&s;i&s;t of le&s;s than four or five thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>THIS winter's campaign (for our troops con&s;tantly kept the field after regaining a footing in the Jer&s;eys) has never yet been faithfully and feelingly de&s;cribed. The &s;udden re&s;toration of our cau&s;e from the very verge of ruin, was interwoven with &s;uch a ti&s;&s;ue of in&s;cru|table cau&s;es and extraordinary events, that, fearful of doing the &s;ubject greater inju&s;tice by a pa&s;&s;ing di&s;|qui&s;ition than a purpo&s;ed &s;ilence, I leave it to the lei|&s;ure of abler pens. The ill policy of the Briti&s;h doubt|le&s;s contributed to accelerate this event. For the man|ner, impolitic as inhuman, in which they managed their temporary conque&s;ts, tended evidently to alienate the af|fections of their adherents, to confirm the wavering in an oppo&s;ite intere&s;t, to rou&s;e the &s;upine into activity, to a&s;&s;emble the di&s;per&s;ed to the Standard of America, and
<PB N="304" REF="022578_0304_0FB99566744AB418">
to infu&s;e a &s;pirit of revolt into the minds of tho&s;e men, who had from nece&s;&s;ity &s;ubmitted to their power. Their conduct in warring with fire and &s;word again&s;t the im|becility of youth and the decrepitude of age; again&s;t the Arts, the Science&s;, the curious Inventions and the elegant improvements in civilized life; again&s;t the me|lancholy Widow, the mi&s;erable Orphan, the peaceable profe&s;&s;or of humane Literature, and the &s;acred Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, &s;eemed to operate as powerfully, as if purpo&s;ely intended to kindle the dormant &s;park of re|&s;i&s;tance into an inextingui&s;hable flame. If we add, to the black catalogue of provocations already enumerat|ed, their in&s;atiable rapacity in plundering friends and foes indi&s;criminately; their libidinous brutality in vi|olating the cha&s;tity of the female &s;ex, their more than Gothic rage in defacing private Writings, public Re|cords, Libraries of learning, Dwellings of individuals, Edifices for education and Temples of the Deity; to|gether with their in&s;ufferable ferocity (unprecedented indeed among civilized nations) in murdering on the field of battle the wounded while begging for mercy, in cau&s;ing their pri&s;oners to fami&s;h with hunger and cold in Pri&s;ons and Pri&s;on-Ships, and in carrying their ma|lice beyond death it&s;elf by denying the decent rites of &s;epulture to the dead,&mdash;we &s;hall not be a&s;toni&s;hed that the Yeomanry in the two Jer&s;eys, when the fir&s;t glim|mering of hope began to break in upon them, ro&s;e as one man, with the unalterable re&s;olution to peri&s;h in the generous cau&s;e or expel their mercile&s;s invaders.</P>

But the enemy did not remove from their winter-quarters until the &s;ea&s;on arrived when green forage could be &s;upplied. In the intermediate period, the corre&s;pondence on the part of General Putnam with the Commander in Chief con&s;i&s;ted principally of re|ports and enquiries concerning the treatment of &s;ome of the following de&s;criptions of per&s;ons: either of tho&s;e who came within our lines with flags and pretended flags, or who had taken protection from the enemy, or who had been reputed di&s;affected to our cau&s;e, or who were de&s;igned to be comprehended in the American Proclamation, which required that tho&s;e who had taken protections &s;hould give them to the neare&s;t American Officer, or go within the Briti&s;h lines. The letters of his Excellency in return, generally advi&s;ory, were in|dicative of confidence and approbation.</P>
<P>WHEN the Spring had now &s;o far advanced that it was obvious the enemy would &s;oon take the field; the Commander in Chief, after de&s;iring General Putnam to give the officers who was to relieve him at Princeton all the information nece&s;&s;ary for the conduct of that po&s;t,

appointed that General to the command of a &s;eparate Army in the Highlands of New-York.</P>
<P>IT is &s;carcely decided, from any documents yet pub|li&s;hed, whether the prepo&s;terous plans pro&s;ecuted by the Briti&s;h Generals in the Campaign of 1777, were al|together the re&s;ult of their Orders from home, or whe|ther they partially originated from the contingences of the moment. The &s;y&s;tem, which, at the time, tended to puzzle all human conjecture, when developed &s;erved, al&s;o, to contradict all rea&s;onable calculation. Certain it is, the American Commander in Chief, was for a con|&s;iderable time &s;o perplexed with contradictory appear|ances, that he knew not how to di&s;tribute his troops, with his u&s;ual di&s;cernment, &s;o as to oppo&s;e the enemy with equal pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in different parts. The gathering tempe&s;ts menaced the northern Frontiers, the po&s;ts in the Highlands and the City of Philadelphia: but it was &s;till doubtful where the &s;ury of the &s;torm would fall. At one time Sir William Howe was forcing his way by land to Philadelphia, at another relinqui&s;h|ing the Jer&s;eys, at a third facing round to make a &s;ud|den inroad, then embarking with all the forces that could be &s;pared from New-York, and then putting out to &s;ea&mdash;at the very moment when General Burgoyne had reduced Ticonderoga, and &s;eemed to require a co|operation in another quarter.</P>
<P>ON our &s;ide, we have &s;een that the old Continental Army expired with the year 1776: &s;ince which, inven|tion had been tortured with expedients and zeal with efforts to levy another. For on the &s;ucce&s;s of the re|cruiting
<PB N="312" REF="022578_0312_0FB9957B94FE6B90">
&s;ervice depended the &s;alvation of the country. The &s;ucce&s;s was &s;uch as not to puff us up to pre&s;ump|tion, or depre&s;s us to de&s;pair. The army in the Jer|&s;eys, under the orders of the General in Chief, con&s;i&s;ted of all the troops rai&s;ed &s;outh of the Hud&s;on: that in the northern department, of the New-Hamp&s;hire Brigade two Brigades, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and the Brigade of New-York, together with &s;ome irregular Corps: and that in the Highlands of the remaining two Bri|gades of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, the Connecticut Line con&s;i&s;ting of two Brigades, the Brigade of Rhode-I&s;land and one Re|giment of New-York. Upon hearing of the lo&s;s of Ticonderoga, and the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h towards Al|bany, General Wa&s;hington ordered the northern army to be reinforced with the two Brigades of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts then in the Highlands&mdash;and, upon finding the army un|der his immediate command out-numbered by that of Sir William Howe, which had by the circuitous route of the Che&s;apeak invaded Penn&s;ylvania, he al&s;o called from the Highlands one of the Connecticut Brigades and that of Rhode-I&s;land to his own a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>IN the neighbourhood of General Putnam there was no enemy capable of exciting alarms. The army left at New-York &s;eemed only de&s;igned for its defence. In it were &s;everal entire Corps, compo&s;ed of Tories who had flocked to the Briti&s;h &s;tandard. There was, be&s;ides, a band of lurking mi&s;creants, not properly enrolled, who &s;taid chiefly at We&s;t Che&s;ter: from whence they infe&s;t|ed the Country between the two armies, pillaged the cattle and carried off the peaceable inhabitants. It was an unworthy policy in Briti&s;h Generals to patronize
<PB N="313" REF="022578_0313_0FB99583837A3688">
Banditti. The Whig inhabitants on the edge of our lines, and &s;till lower down, who had been plundered in a mercile&s;s manner, delayed not to &s;trip the Tories in return. People, mo&s;t nearly connected and allied, fre|quently became mo&s;t exa&s;perated and inveterate in ma|lice. Then the ties of fellow&s;hip were broken&mdash;then, friend&s;hip it&s;elf being &s;oured to enmity, the mind rea|dily gave way to private revenge, uncontroled retali|ation and all the deforming pa&s;&s;ions that di&s;grace huma|nity. Enormities, almo&s;t without a name, were perpe|trated&mdash;at the de&s;cription of which, the bo&s;om, not fro|zen to apathy, mu&s;t glow with a mixture of pity and indignation.

The information of this intended enterprize, conveyed to him through &s;everal channels, was corroborated by that obtained and tran&s;mitted by the Commander in Chief.</P>
<P>IT was not wonderful that many of the&s;e Tories were able, undi&s;covered, to penetrate far into the country and even to go with letters or me&s;&s;ages from one Briti&s;h Ar|my to another. The inhabitants, who were well affected to the royal cau&s;e, afforded them every po&s;&s;ible &s;upport, and their own knowledge of the different routes gave them a farther facility in performing their peregrina|tions.

<P>IMPORTANT tran&s;actions &s;oon occurred. Not long after the two Brigades had marched from Peek's-Kill to Penn&s;ylvania, a reinforcement arrived at New-York from Europe. Appearances indicated that offen&s;ive o|perations would follow. General Putnam, having been reduced in force to a &s;ingle Brigade in the field, and a &s;ingle Regiment in garri&s;on at Fort Montgomery, re|peatedly informed the Commander in Chief that the po&s;ts committed to his charge mu&s;t in all probability be lo&s;t, in ca&s;e an attempt &s;hould be made upon them; and that, circum&s;tanced as he was, he could not be re&s;pon|&s;ible for the con&s;equences. His &s;ituation was certainly to be lamented, but it was not in the power of the Commander in Chief to alter it, except by authori&s;ing him to call upon the Militia for aid&mdash;an aid always pre|carious; and often &s;o tardy, as when obtained to be of no utility.</P>
<P>ON the fifth of October, Sir Henry Clinton came up the North River with three thou&s;and men. After mak|ing many feints to mi&s;lead the attention, he landed, the next morning, at Stony Point, and commenced his march

over the mountains to Fort Montgomery. Governor Clinton, an active, re&s;olute and intelligent officer, who commanded the Garri&s;on, upon being appri&s;ed of the movement, di&s;patched a letter by expre&s;s to General Putnam for &s;uccor. By the treachery of the me&s;&s;en|ger the letter mi&s;carried. General Putnam, a&s;toni&s;hed at hearing nothing re&s;pecting the enemy, rode, with General Par&s;ons and Colonel Root his Adjutant General, to reconnoitre them at King's Ferry. In the mean time, at five o'clock in the afternoon, Sir Henry Clinton's co|lumns, having &s;urmounted the ob&s;tacles and barriers of nature, de&s;cended from the Thunder-Hill, through thick|ets impa&s;&s;able but for light troops and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author of the&s;e Memoirs, then Major of Brigade to the fir&s;t Connecticut Brigade, was alone at Head-Quarters when the firing began. He ha&s;tened to Colonel Wyllys, the &s;enior officer in camp, and advi&s;ed him to di&s;patch all the men not on duty to Fort Montgomery, without waiting for or|ders. About five hundred men marched in&s;tantly under Colonel Meigs; and the author, with Doctor Beard&s;ley, a Surgeon in the Brigade, rode at full &s;peed through a bye-path, to let the garri&s;on know, that a reinforcement was on its march. Not|with&s;tanding all the ha&s;te the&s;e officers made to and over the river, the Fort was &s;o completely inve&s;ted, on their arrival, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to enter.

redoubts. The garri&s;on, in&s;pired by the conduct of their leaders, defended the works with di&s;tingui&s;hed va|lor. But, as the po&s;t had been de&s;igned principally to prevent the pa&s;&s;ing of &s;hips, and as an a&s;&s;ault in rear had not been expected, the works on the land &s;ide were incomplete and untenable. In the du&s;k of twilight the Briti&s;h entered with their bayonets fixed. Their lo&s;s was incon&s;iderable. Nor was that of the garri&s;on great. Governor Clinton, his brother General James Clin|ton, Colonel Dubois, and mo&s;t of the officers and men effected their e&s;cape under cover of the thick &s;moke and darkne&s;s that &s;uddenly prevailed. The capture of this fort by Sir Henry Clinton, together with the con|&s;equent removal of the chains and booms that ob&s;tructed the navigation, opened a pa&s;&s;age to Albany, and &s;eemed to favor a junction of his force with that of General Burgoyne. But the latter having been compelled to capitulate a few days after this event, and great num|bers of Militia having arrived from New-England, the &s;ucce&s;sful army returned to New-York&mdash;yet not before a detachment from it, under the Orders of General

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the army in the Highlands had been &s;o much weakened (for the &s;ake of &s;trengthening the armies in other quarters) as to have occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of Fort Montgomery, yet that lo&s;s was productive of no con&s;equences. Our main army in Penn&s;ylvania, after having contended with &s;uperior force in two inde|ci&s;ive battles, &s;till held the enemy in check. While the &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;s, which attended our arms at the North|ward, gave a more favorable a&s;pect to the American af|fairs, at the clo&s;e of this campaign, than they had ever before a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>WHEN the enemy fell back to New-York by water, we followed them a part of the way by land. Colonel Meigs, with a detachment from the &s;everal Regiments in General Par&s;ons's Brigade, having made a forced march from Crompond to We&s;t-Che&s;ter, &s;urpri&s;ed and broke up for a time the band of freebooters, of whom he brought off fifty, together with many Cattle and Hor&s;es which they had recently &s;tolen.</P>
<P>SOON after this enterprize, General Putnam advanced towards the Briti&s;h lines. As he had received intelli|gence that &s;mall bodies of the enemy were out with or|ders from Governor Tryon to burn Wright's Mills, he prevented it by detaching three parties of one hundred men in each.

<P>WHILE General Putnam quartered at New-Rochel, a &s;couting party which had been &s;ent to We&s;t Farms, below We&s;t-Che&s;ter, &s;urrounded the hou&s;e in which Colonel James Delancey lodged, and, notwith&s;tanding he crept under the bed the better to be concealed, brought him to Head-Quarters before morning. This Officer was exchanged by the Briti&s;h General without delay, and placed at the head of the Cow-Boys, a licen|tious Corps of irregulars, who, in the &s;equel, commit|ted unheard-of depredations and exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>IT was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to &s;ee &s;o beautiful a part of the country &s;o barbarou&s;ly wa&s;ted; and, often to witne&s;s &s;ome peculiar &s;cene of female mi&s;ery. For mo&s;t of the female inhabitants had been obliged to fly within the lines po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one army or the other. Near our quarters was an affecting in&s;tance of human vici&s;&s;itude. Mr. William Sutton of Maroneck, an inoffen&s;ive man, a merchant by profe&s;&s;ion, who lived in a decent fa&s;hion, and who&s;e family had as happy pro&s;pects as almo&s;t any in the country, upon &s;ome imputation of Toryi&s;m went to the enemy. His wife, oppre&s;&s;ed with grief in the
<PB N="320" REF="022578_0320_0FB99594C999AC10">
di&s;agreeable &s;tate of dereliction, did not long &s;urvive. Bet&s;ey Sutton, their elde&s;t daughter, was a mode&s;t and lovely young woman, of about fifteen years old, when at the death of her mother, the care of five or &s;ix young|er children devolved upon her. She was di&s;creet and provident beyond her years. But when we &s;aw her, &s;he looked to be feeble in health&mdash;broken in &s;pirit&mdash;wan, melancholy, and dejected. She &s;aid <Q>that their la&s;t cow, which furni&s;hed milk for the children, had lately been taken away&mdash;that they had frequently been plundered of their wearing apparel and furni|ture, &s;he believed, by both parties&mdash;that they had little more to lo&s;e&mdash;and that &s;he knew not where to procure bread for the dear little ones, who had no father to provide for them</Q>&mdash;<HI>no mother</HI>&mdash;&s;he was go|ing to have &s;aid&mdash;but a torrent of tears choaked articu|lation. In coming to that part of the country, again, after &s;ome campaigns had elap&s;ed, I found the habita|tion de&s;olate and the garden overgrown with weeds. Upon enquiry, I learnt, that, as &s;oon as we left the place, &s;ome ruffians broke into the hou&s;e, while &s;he lay in bed, in the latter part of the night: and that, having been terrified by their rudene&s;s, &s;he ran half-naked into a neighbouring &s;wamp, where &s;he continued until the morning&mdash;there the poor girl caught a violent cold, which ended in a con&s;umption. It fini&s;hed a life with|out a &s;pot&mdash;and a career of &s;ufferings commenced and continued without a fault.</P>
<P>SIGHTS of wretchedne&s;s always touched with com|mi&s;eration the feelings of General Putnam, and prompt|ed his generous &s;oul to &s;uccor the afflicted. But the
<PB N="321" REF="022578_0321_0FB9959A33F6E310">
indulgence, which he &s;hewed (whenever it did not mi|litate again&s;t his duty) towards the de&s;erted and &s;uffer|ing families of the Tories in the State of New-York, was the cau&s;e of his becoming unpopular with no in|con&s;iderable cla&s;s of people in that State. On the other &s;ide, he had conceived an unconquerable aver&s;ion to ma|ny of the per&s;ons, who were entru&s;ted with the di&s;po&s;al of Tory-property, becau&s;e he believed them to have been guilty of peculations and other infamous practices. But, although the enmity between him and the Seque&s;|trators was acrimonious as mutual; yet he lived in ha|bits of amity with the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters in public departments, as well as in private life.</P>
<P>His character was al&s;o re&s;pected by the enemy. He had been acquainted with many of the principal Officers in a former war. As flags frequently pa&s;&s;ed between the out-po&s;ts, during his continuance on the lines, it was a common practice to forward News-Papers by them; and as tho&s;e printed by Rivington, the Royal Printer in New-York, were infamous for the fal&s;ehoods with which they abounded, General Putnam once &s;ent a Packet to his old friend General Robert&s;on with this Billet: <Q>Major General Putnam pre&s;ents his Compli|ments to Major General, Robert&s;on and &s;ends him &s;ome American News-Papers for his peru&s;al&mdash;when Gene|ral Robert&s;on &s;hall have done with them, it is reque&s;t|ed they be given to Rivington, in order that he may print &s;ome truth.</Q></P>
<P>LATE in the year we left the lines and repaired to the Highlands. For upon the lo&s;s of fort Montgomery,
<PB N="322" REF="022578_0322_0FB9959B0BA15F08">
the Commander in Chief determined to build another fortification for the defence of the river. His Excellen|cy, accordingly, wrote to General Putnam to fix upon the &s;pot. After reconnoitering all the different places propo&s;ed, and revolving in his own mind their relative advantages for offence on the water and defence on the land, he fixed upon WEST POINT. It is no vulgar prai&s;e to &s;ay, that to him belongs the glory of having cho&s;en this rock of our military &s;alvation. The po&s;i|tion for water batteries, which might &s;weep the chan|nel where the river formed a right angle, made it the mo&s;t proper of any for commanding the navigation; while the rocky ridges, that ro&s;e in awful &s;ublimity be|hind each other, rendered it impregnable, and even in|capable of being inve&s;ted by le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and men. The Briti&s;h, who con&s;idered this po&s;t as a &s;ort of American Gibraltar, never attempted it but by the treachery of an American officer. All the world knows that this project failed, and that We&s;t Point continues to be the receptacle of every thing valuable in military preparations to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>IN the month of January, 1778, when a &s;now two feet deep lay on the earth, General Par&s;ons's Brigade went to We&s;t Point and broke ground. Want of co|vering for the troops, together with want of tools and materials for the works, made the pro&s;pect truly gloo|my and di&s;couraging. It was nece&s;&s;ary that means &s;hould be found, though our currency was depreciated and our trea&s;ury exhau&s;ted. The e&s;timates and requi|&s;itions of Colonel la Radiere, the Engineer who laid out the works, altogether di&s;proportioned to our circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="323" REF="022578_0323_0FB9959CDAA99F60">
&s;erved only to put us in mind of our poverty, and, as it were, to &s;atirize our re&s;ources. His petulant behavior and unaccommodating di&s;po&s;ition added fur|ther embarra&s;&s;ments. It was then that the patrioti&s;m of Governor Clinton &s;hone in full lu&s;tre. His exertions to furni&s;h &s;upplies can never be too much commended. His influence, ari&s;ing from his popularity, was unli|mited: yet he he&s;itated not to put all his popularity at ri&s;que, whenever the federal intere&s;ts demanded. Not|with&s;tanding the impediments that oppo&s;ed our progre&s;s, with his aid, before the opening of the campaign, the works were in great forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to a re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, an enquiry was to be made into the cau&s;es of military di&s;a&s;ters. Major General M'Dougall, Brigadier General Hunting|ton and Colonel Wiggle&s;worth compo&s;ed the Court of Enquiry on the lo&s;s of Fort Montgomery. Upon full knowledge and mature deliberation of facts on the &s;pot, they reported the lo&s;s to have been occa&s;ioned by want of men, and not by any fault in the Commanders.</P>
<P>GENERAL Putnam, who during the inve&s;tigation, was relieved from duty, as &s;oon as Congre&s;s had approv|ed the Report, took command of the right Wing of the Grand Army, under the Orders of the General in Chief. This was ju&s;t after the Battle of Monmouth, when the three armies which had, la&s;t year, acted &s;epa|rately, joined at the White Plains. Our effective force, in one camp, was at no other time &s;o re&s;pectable as at this juncture. The army con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixty regular Re|giments of foot formed into fifteen Brigades, four Bat|talions
<PB N="324" REF="022578_0324_0FB995A05A4B1058">
of Artillery, four Regiments of Hor&s;e and &s;e|veral Corps of State Troops. But as the enemy kept clo&s;e within their Lines on York-I&s;land, nothing could be attempted. Towards the end of Autumn, we broke up the Camp, and went fir&s;t to Frederick&s;burg, and thence to winter quarters.</P>
<P>IN order to cover the country adjoining to the <HI>Sound,</HI> and to &s;upport the garri&s;on of <HI>We&s;t Point,</HI> in ca&s;e of an attack, Major General Putnam was &s;tationed for the winter at Reading in Connecticut. He had under his Orders the Brigade of New-Hamp&s;hire, the two Bri|gades of Connecticut, the Corps of Infantry commanded by Hazen, and that of Cavalry by Sheldon.</P>
<P>THE troops, who had been badly fed, badly cloathed, and wor&s;e paid, by brooding over their grievances in the lei&s;ure and inactivity of winter-quarters, began to think them intolerable. The Connecticut Brigades form|ed the de&s;ign of marching to Hartford, where the Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly was then in Se&s;&s;ion, and of demanding redre&s;s at the point of the bayonet. Word having been brought to General Putnam, that the &s;econd Brigade was under arms for this purpo&s;e, he mounted his hor&s;e, galloped to the Cantonment and thus addre&s;&s;ed them: <Q>My brave lads, whither are you going? Do you in|tend to de&s;ert your Officers, and to invite the enemy to follow you into the country? Who&s;e cau&s;e have you been fighting and &s;uffering &s;o long in, is it not your own? Have you no property, no parents, wives or children? You have behaved like men &s;o far&mdash;all the world is full of your prai&s;es&mdash;and po&s;terity
<PB N="325" REF="022578_0325_0FB995A3F92862A0">
will &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed at your deeds: but not if you &s;poil all at la&s;t. Don't you confider how much the country is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the war, and that your officers have not been any better paid than your&s;elves? But we all expect better times, and that the Country will do us ample ju&s;tice. Let us all &s;tand by one another' then, and fight it out like brave Soldiers. Think what a &s;hame it would be for Connecticut-men to run away from their Officers.</Q>&mdash;After the &s;everal Regiments had received the General as he rode along the line <HI>with drums beating and pre&s;ented arms;</HI> the Ser|geants, who had then the command, brought the men <HI>to an Order,</HI> in which po&s;ition they continued while he was &s;peaking. When he had done, he directed the acting Major of Brigade to give the word for them to &s;houlder, march to their Regimental parades and lodge arms. All which they executed with promptitude and appa|rent good-humor. One Soldier only, who had been the mo&s;t active, was confined in the quarter-guard: from whence, at night, he attempted to make his e&s;cape. But the centinel, who had al&s;o been in the mutiny, &s;hot him dead on the &s;pot, and thus the affair &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of winter, while General Putnam was on a vi&s;it to his out-po&s;t at Hor&s;e-Neck, he found Governor Tryon advancing upon that town with a corps of fifteen hundred men&mdash;to oppo&s;e the&s;e, General Put|nam had only a Picquet of one hundred and fifty men, and two iron field pieces without hor&s;es or drag-ropes. He, however, planted his cannon on the high ground by the meeting-hou&s;e, and retarded their reproach by firing &s;everal times, until, perceiving the hor&s;e (&s;up|ported
<PB N="326" REF="022578_0326_0FB995A773D30F30">
by the infantry) about to charge, he ordered the picquet to provide for their &s;afety by retiring to a &s;wamp inacce&s;&s;ible to hor&s;e; and &s;ecured his own by plunging down the &s;teep precipice at the church upon a full trot. This precipice is &s;o &s;leep, where he de&s;cend|ed, as to have artificial &s;tairs compo&s;ed of nearly one hundred &s;tone-&s;teps for the accommodation of foot pa&s;|&s;engers. There the Dragoons, who were but a &s;word's length from him, &s;topped &s;hort. For the declivity was &s;o abrupt that they ventured not to follow: and, before they could gain the valley by going round the brow of the hill in the ordinary road, he was far enough be|yond their reach. He continued his route unmole&s;ted to Stanford, from whence, having &s;trengthened his pic|quet by the junction of &s;ome militia, he came back a|gain, and in turn, pur&s;ued Governor Tryon in his re|treat. As he rode down the precipice, one ball, of the many fired at him, went through his beaver. But Go|vernor Tryon, by way of compen&s;ation for &s;poiling his hat, &s;ent him &s;oon afterwards, as a pre&s;ent, a complete &s;uit of cloaths.</P>
<P>IN the Campaign of 1779, which terminated the ca|reer of General Putnam's &s;ervices, he commanded the Maryland line po&s;ted at Butter-milk falls, about two miles below We&s;t Point. He was happy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the friend&s;hip of the officers of that line, and in living on terms of ho&s;pitality with them. Indeed there was no family in the army that lived better than his own. The General, his &s;econd &s;on Major Daniel Putnam, and the writer of the&s;e Memoirs compo&s;ed that family. This campaign, principally &s;pent in &s;trengthening the works
<PB N="327" REF="022578_0327_0FB995A9DD0A1500">
of We&s;t Point, was only &s;ignali&s;ed for the &s;torm of Sto|ny Point by the Light Infantry under the conduct of General Wayne, and the &s;urpri&s;e of the po&s;t of Powles Hook by the Corps under the command of Colonel Henry Lee. When the army quitted the field and march|ed to Morris Town into winter-quarters, General Put|nam's family went into Connecticut for a few weeks. In December, the General began his journey to Morris Town. Upon the road between Pomfret and Hartford he felt an unu&s;ual torpor &s;lowly pervading his right hand and foot. This heavine&s;s crept gradually on, and until it had deprived him of the u&s;e of his limbs on that &s;ide, in a con&s;iderable degree, before he reached the hou&s;e of his friend Colonel Wad&s;worth. Still he was unwilling to con&s;ider his di&s;order of the paralytic kind, and endeavoured to &s;hake it off by exertion. Having found that impo&s;&s;ible, a temporary dejection, di&s;gui&s;ed however under a veil of a&s;&s;umed chearfulne&s;s, &s;ucceeded. But rea&s;on, philo&s;ophy, and religion, &s;oon reconciled him to his fate. In that &s;ituation he has con&s;tantly re|mained, favored with &s;uch a portion of bodily activity as enables him to walk and to ride moderately; and re|taining unimpaired his reli&s;h for enjoyment, his love of plea&s;antry, his &s;trength of memory, and all the faculties of his mind. As a proof that the powers of memory are not weakened, it ought to be ob&s;erved, that he has lately repeated from recollection all the adventures of his life, which are here recorded, and which had for|merly been communicated to the compiler in detached conver&s;ations.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your favor of the 20th of May I received with much plea&s;ure. For I can a&s;&s;ure you that among the many worthy and meritorious Officers, with whom I have had the happine&s;s to be connected in &s;ervice through the cour&s;e of this war, and from who&s;e cheerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the various and trying vici&s;&s;i|tudes of a complicated conte&s;t, <HI>the name of a</HI> PUTNAM <HI>is not forgotten:</HI> nor will be, but with that &s;troke of time which &s;hall obliterate from my mind the re|membrance of all tho&s;e toils and fatigues, through which we have &s;truggled for the pre&s;ervation and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Rights, Liberties</HI> and <HI>Indepen|dence</HI> of our <HI>Country.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR congratulations on the happy pro&s;pects of Peace and Independent &s;ecurity, with their attendant ble&s;&s;ings to the UNITED STATES, I receive with great &s;ati&s;faction; and beg that you will accept a return of my gratulations to you on this au&s;picious event&mdash;
<PB N="329" REF="022578_0329_0FB995AC845DD7F8">
an event, in which, great as it is in it&s;elf and glorious as it will probably be in its con&s;equences, you have a right to participate largely, from the di&s;tingui&s;hed part you have contributed towards its attainment.</P>
<P>BUT while I contemplate the greatne&s;s of the ob|ject for which we have contended, and felicitate you on the happy i&s;&s;ue of our toils and labors, which have terminated with &s;uch general &s;ati&s;faction; I la|ment that you &s;hould feel the ungrateful returns of a Country, in who&s;e &s;ervice you have exhau&s;ted your bodily &s;trength, and expended the vigor of a youth|ful con&s;titution. I wi&s;h however, that your expec|tations of returning liberality may be verified. I have a hope, they may:&mdash;but &s;hould they not, your ca&s;e will not be a &s;ingular one. <HI>Ingratitude has been experienced in all ages,</HI> and REPUBLICS <HI>in particular, have ever been famed for the exerci&s;e of that unnatural, and</HI> SORDID VICE.</P>
<P>THE SECRETARY AT WAR, who is now here, in|forms me that you have ever been con&s;idered as en|titled to full pay, &s;ince your ab&s;ence from the field; and that you will &s;till be con&s;idered in that light un|til the clo&s;e of the war: at which period you will be equally entitled to the &s;ame emoluments of half-pay or commutation, as other officers of your rank. The &s;ame opinion is al&s;o given by the Pay Ma&s;ter Gene|ral, who is now with the army, impowered by Mr. Morris for the &s;ettlement of all their accounts, and who will attend to your's whenever you &s;hall think

proper to &s;end on for the purpo&s;e; which it will pro|bably be be&s;t for you to do in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>I ANTICIPATE, with plea&s;ure, the day (and that I tru&s;t not far off) when I &s;hall quit the bu&s;y &s;cenes of a military employment, and retire to the more tran|quil walks of dome&s;tic life. In that, or whatever other &s;ituation Providence may di&s;po&s;e of my &s;utu days, THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE MANY FRIEND|SHIPS AND CONNECTIONS I HAVE HAD THE HAP|PINESS TO CONTRACT WITH THE GENTLEMEN OF THE ARMY, WILL BE ONE OF MY MOST GRATE|FUL REFLECTIONS. <HI>Under this contemplation, and impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;entiments of benevolence and regard, I commend you, my dear Sir, my other friends, and, with them, the intere&s;ts and happine&s;s of our dear Coun|try to the</HI> KEEPING AND PROTECTION OF ALMIGHTY GOD.</P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the la&s;t Anniver&s;ary of Independence, my dear fellow-citizens! we have been witne&s;&s;es to the complete e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new general government: On an event of &s;uch magnitude, the voice of congratu|lation has already been heard from one extreme of our land to the other. But as our felicitations can never be more grateful than at the time, when we are convened to commemorate the birth of our nation; it may per|haps be expected, from the ta&s;k I am called upon to perform this day, that I &s;hould be the organ for expre&s;&s;|ing the part we bear in this univer&s;al joy. I feel a con|fidence, from the &s;en&s;ations of my own heart, that every bo&s;om in this a&s;&s;embly beats high at the thought of our country's happine&s;s. Even the ardent eyes and the animated countenances of all who compo&s;e it, atte&s;t how &s;incerely they rejoice in the pro&s;pect before them. But, in the mid&s;t of our rejoicings, we ought to remember, that no occa&s;ion can be more &s;uitable than the pre&s;ent, for employing our reflections on our political &s;ituation. I will therefore hope for your indulgence, while I make a few ob&s;ervations on the American Revolution: on the nece&s;&s;ity which afterwards appeared for e&s;tabli&s;hing a general government of more energy than the original confederation: on the nature of the government which has lately been carried into effect: and on the national pro&s;perity which we may rea&s;onably expect will re&s;ult from the faithful admini&s;tration of that government.</P>
<P>AT the commencement of the late war with Great
<PB N="334" REF="022578_0333_0FB995B7140EEB10">
Britain, when we thought our&s;elves ju&s;tifiable in re&s;i&s;ting to blood, it was known to tho&s;e be&s;t acquainted with the different conditions of the combatants, and the pro|bable co&s;t of the prize in di&s;pute, that the expence, in compari&s;on with our circum&s;tances as coloni&s;ts, mu&s;t be enormous&mdash;the &s;truggle protracted, doubtful and &s;evere. It was known that the re&s;ources of Britain were almo&s;t inexhau&s;tible, that her fleets covered the ocean, and that her troops had harve&s;ted laurels in every quarter of the globe. Not then organi&s;ed as a nation, or known as a peo|ple on the earth, we had no preparations. Money, the nerve of war, was wanting. The &s;word was to be forged on the anvil of nece&s;&s;ity: the trea&s;ury to be created from nothing. If we had a re&s;ource, unknown to our enemy, it was in the unconquerable re&s;olution, to our citizens, the con&s;cious rectitude of our cau&s;e, and a confident tru&s;t that we &s;hould not be for&s;aken by Heaven. The people wil|lingly offered them&s;elves to the battle; but the means of arming, clothing and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them; as well as of providing the general implements of ho&s;tility were only to be found in anticipations of our future wealth. Bills of credit were emitted: monies borrowed for the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing emergencies: and our men in the field unpaid for their &s;ervices. At this time the magnanimous mo|narch of France reached a fo&s;tering hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t in re&s;|ening us from ruin. In this manner, peace, attended with every circum&s;tance that could gratify our rea&s;onable de|&s;ires, was at length obtained. But a load of debt was left upon us. The fluctuation of our paper currency, and the con&s;equent frequency of &s;peculation in it, had, in too many in&s;tances, occa&s;ioned vague ideas of proper|ty,
<PB N="335" REF="022578_0334_0FB995B851467C40">
produced licentious appetites, and corrupted the morals of men. To the&s;e immediate con&s;equences of a fluctuating medium of commerce, may be joined a tide of circum&s;tances, that flowed together from &s;ources mo&s;tly opened during and after the war. The ravage of farms, the conflagration of towns, the diminution of agriculture, the extinction of trade, the embarra&s;&s;ment of &s;ome who were indebted to Briti&s;h merchants before the war, the privation in all (during its continuance) of many conveniences of life, the &s;ub&s;equent influx of mer|chandize, the tempting facility of procuring it without pre&s;ent payment, the growing ta&s;te for extravagance, and the habit&mdash;too &s;oon acquired!&mdash;of deferring or elu|ding &s;ati&s;faction for ju&s;t obligations, now began to over|whelm the continent with private di&s;tre&s;s, bankruptey and breach of faith.</P>
<P>FROM this period al&s;o our public affairs were &s;een to decline. I will a&s;k your attention for a moment, while I &s;peak of the un&s;ati&s;factory part of our old confedera|tion, and the nece&s;&s;ity that became apparent for in&s;titut|ing a different form of government. It is not a &s;ub|ject of wonder that the fir&s;t project of a federal govern|ment, formed on the defective models of &s;ome foreign confederacies, in the mid&s;t of a war, before we had much experience in political affairs; and while, from the concurrence of external danger, and the patriotic impul&s;e of the moment, implicit obedience was yielded to the requi&s;itions of an Advi&s;ory Council, &s;hould have been imperfect. Our a&s;toni&s;hment ought rather to be excited, that, feeble and inefficient as the government was, it not only carried us in &s;afety through the war,
<PB N="336" REF="022578_0335_0FB995BA6C2C6D08">
but kept us from &s;everance until another could be &s;ub|&s;tituted. By the original confederation, the right to make demands on the &s;everal &s;tates for &s;uch pecuniary &s;upplies as might be nece&s;&s;ary for defraying the expen|ces of the war, and for &s;upporting the government of the Union, together with &s;ome other &s;pecific preroga|tives of &s;overeignty, were committed to Congre&s;s. But Congre&s;s, con&s;tituted in mo&s;t re&s;pects as a diplomatic body, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no power of carrying into execution a &s;ingle re&s;olution, however urgently dictated by prudence, policy, or ju&s;tice. The individual communities, know|ing there exi&s;ted no power of coercion, treated with ne|glect, whenever it &s;uited their convenience or caprice, the mo&s;t &s;alutary mea&s;ures and the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;itions of Congre&s;s. Experience taught us, that the powers given by the members of the union to their federal head, were not &s;ufficient to enable it to accom|pli&s;h the purpo&s;es for which the body politic had been formed. We now touched on the hour of humiliation. The confederacy was found to be a government in name, rather than in reality. Hence the intere&s;t due on our public debts remained unpaid. Hence many a veteran was reduced to unmerited di&s;tre&s;s. Hence we were continually liable on our own part to have infractions made upon treaties, which were equally honorable, ad|vantageous and &s;acred. Hence we were in danger of having our faith become as proverbial as that of Car|thage, and our name the &s;corn of the earth. Hence there was a nation, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, excluded our ve&s;&s;els from its ports, burdened our commerce with in|tolerable impo&s;itions, introduced its &s;hips into our car|rying trade, and, becau&s;e we were de&s;titute of a retali|ating
<PB N="337" REF="022578_0336_0FB995BB62ECFE88">
power, refu&s;ed to enter into a commercial treaty with us. With a debt accumulating from the nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining repeated loans; with a credit much im|paired for the want of punctuality, and apprehen&s;ion of national bankruptcy; with cries for ju&s;tice from the widow, the fatherle&s;s, and the &s;oldier worn out in his country's defence, a&s;cending to that Being who hath purer eyes than to behold iniquity with impunity, who is a God of vengeance as well as a God of ju&s;tice&mdash;whither could we turn for &s;uccor? where could we fly for refuge?</P>
<P>THE veil that concealed this melancholy and afflicting picture was at la&s;t withdrawn. The wi&s;e and the good &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ight, none but the ignorant or the wicked re&s;ted unconcerned. Even fearfulne&s;s &s;eized, in many in&s;tances, upon tho&s;e well-meaning politicians, who&s;e &s;ecurity had been produced by the &s;cantine&s;s of their information, and the confinement of their views to the local advantages of the &s;tates to which they belong|ed. Then it was that men, better informed and more conver&s;ant in civil affairs, began to dread that a free, yet efficient government, the object which animated in life, and &s;oothed in death, tho&s;e heroes who had &s;ealed their principles with their blood, mu&s;t &s;till be lo&s;t: that the pro&s;pect of national happine&s;s, which invigorated our arms and cheered our hearts through the perilous &s;truggle for Independence, mu&s;t vani&s;h for ever from our view: and that the hope of e&s;tabli&s;hing the empire of rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, philo&s;ophy and religion, throughout the exten&s;ive regions of the new world, would be con&s;idered but the illu&s;ion of a heated imagination. And what
<PB N="338" REF="022578_0337_0FB995BFA9FD9688">
could be more mortifying to every true patriot, than to perceive our countrymen ready to ru&s;h headlong on their ruin&mdash;ready to de&s;troy the a&s;ylum which was ju&s;t offer|ed for &s;uffering humanity&mdash;ready to verify the predic|tions of our foes, that our Independence would prove a cur&s;e to its votaries&mdash;and (by fru&s;trating the faire&s;t op|portunity ever afforded for a people to become great and happy in the enjoyment of freedom) to confirm the dete&s;table doctrine that mankind, unequal to the ta&s;k of governing them&s;elves, were made for a &s;tate of &s;lavery?&mdash;Thus our old confederation &s;eemed pa&s;&s;ing away. Our day of political probation appeared expiring. The <HI>Re|public</HI> was about to a&s;&s;ume, if I may be allowed the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, a renovated body, prepared for a more perma|nent &s;tate of exi&s;tence in bli&s;s or woe. Life and death were in our option. The fir&s;t was involved in UNION under a good general government&mdash;the la&s;t in SEPERA|TION into a number of mi&s;erable fragments of empire. So long as &s;trength mu&s;t be deemed preferable to weak|ne&s;s, harmony to confu&s;ion, peace to war, happine&s;s to mi&s;ery, and Independence to &s;ubjugation, the American People (who will always judge right when they &s;hall have the means of information) could not he&s;itate to prefer the former. Nor is it unworthy of remark, that, amid&s;t the variety of opinions which prevailed re&s;pect|ing the &s;y&s;tem of government proper to be adopted, no man was found &s;o hardy as to outrage the feelings of his countrymen, by openly advocating coun&s;els of di&s;u|nion. And may we not, uninfluenced by &s;uper&s;tition, believe that Heaven infu&s;ed the idea into our Legi&s;la|tures, to convoke a national a&s;&s;embly, at this intere&s;ting and awful cri&s;is!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="022578_0338_0FB995C3C8201BD0">
THE re&s;ult is &s;o well known, that I forbear to dilate upon it. Happily the &s;pirit of accommodation, that in|fluenced the Convention, has been diffu&s;ed among their countrymen. The adoption of the government by &s;o many communities, di&s;tinct in their views and intere&s;ts, will be an immortal memorial, of victory gained by en|lightened rea&s;on over brutal force. Can we contemplate a whole People, like a nation of Philo&s;ophers, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing and agreeing on a form of government: can we con|template a work &s;o va&s;t in its import, and &s;o wonderful|ly effected&mdash;not by violence and blood&s;hed, but by de|liberation and con&s;ent&mdash;without exclaiming in rapturous admiration, behold a new thing under the fun! and without uttering in grateful adoration, lo, this is indeed the LORD's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes!&mdash;</P>
<P>WITHOUT pre&s;uming to tre&s;pa&s;s on your patience &s;o far as to attempt to anali&s;e the Con&s;titution, or to de|mon&s;trate its merits by logical deductions; I may per|haps be permitted ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that it appears, to be, in its formation, a government of the people, that is to &s;ay, a government in which all power is derived from, and at &s;tated periods, reverts to them&mdash;and that, in its operation, it is a government of laws made and executed by the fair &s;ub&s;titutes of the people alone. The elec|tion of the different branches of Congre&s;s by the free men, either directly or indirectly, is the pivot on which turns the fir&s;t wheel of government&mdash;a wheel which communicates motion to the whole machine: At the &s;ame time, the exerci&s;e of this right of election &s;eems to be &s;o regulated, as to afford le&s;s opportunity for cor|ruption and influence; and more for &s;tability and vo|lition
<PB N="340" REF="022578_0339_0FB995C78424B6F8">
than has u&s;ually been incident to popular govern|ments. Nor could the members of Congre&s;s exempt them&s;elves from the con&s;equences of any unju&s;t or ty|rannical acts, which they might impo&s;e upon others. For, in a &s;hort time, they will mingle with the ma&s;s of the people. Their intere&s;ts mu&s;t therefore be the &s;ame, and their feelings in &s;ympathy with tho&s;e of their Con&s;titu|ents. Be&s;ides, their re-election mu&s;t always depend upon the good reputation which they &s;hall have main|tained, in the judgment of their fellow citizens. Hence, we may be induced to conclude, that this government is le&s;s obnoxious to well-founded objections, than mo&s;t which have exi&s;ted in the world. And, in that opinion we may be confirmed on three accounts: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e every government ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of powers ade|quate to the purpo&s;es for which it was in&s;tituted: <HI>Se|condly,</HI> becau&s;e no other, or greater powers, appear to be delegated to this government, than are e&s;&s;ential to attain the objects for which it was in&s;tituted, to wit, the &s;afety and happine&s;s of the governed: and, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> becau&s;e it is clear, that no government, before introduced among mankind, ever contained &s;o many checks or &s;uch effica|cious re&s;traints, to prevent it from degenerating into any &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;i&s;ted upon, becau&s;e it is well under&s;tood, that the impotence of Congre&s;s under the former confederation, and the in|expediency of tru&s;ting &s;ufficiently ample prerogatives to a &s;ingle body, gave birth to the different branches which con&s;titute the pre&s;ent general government. Convinced that the balances, ari&s;ing from the di&s;tribution of the Legi&s;lative, Executive, and Judicial Powers in this go|vernment, are the be&s;t which have hitherto been in&s;titu|ted;
<PB N="341" REF="022578_0340_0FB995C8C5B2FFE8">
I pre&s;ume not to a&s;&s;ert that better may not &s;till be devi&s;ed. To avoid a wanton levity of innovation on the one hand, and an unalterable practice of error on the other, are points in policy equally de&s;irable; though, I believe, a con&s;titutional power to effect them never before exi&s;ted. Whether the mode which is pointed out in this Con&s;titution, for procuring amendments, be not the wi&s;e&s;t, and apparently the happie&s;t expedient that ever has been &s;ugge&s;ted by human prudence, I leave every unprejudiced mind to determine. If, in the mean time, it was a given point, that the late federal govern|ment could not have exi&s;ted much longer; if without &s;ome &s;peedy remedy a di&s;&s;olution of the Union mu&s;t have en&s;ued; if without adhering to the Union we could have no &s;ecurity again&s;t falling a prey to foreign inva&s;ion or dome&s;tic u&s;urpation; if upon our adherence to the Union depended the protection of our property at home, and the profits of our commerce abroad; if the almo&s;t unanimous agreement of the federal Convention upon this plan of government (under the local pre|judices and various expectations of the States) could be deemed little &s;hort of miraculous; if there was an ea&s;y provi&s;ion made for the correction of &s;uch errors as &s;hould be found, from the imbecillity of human nature, to have in&s;inuated them&s;elves into it; and if, upon a rejection previous to amendments, there did not appear any pro|bability that the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem could be &s;oon enough amended, or any other &s;ub&s;tituted in its place by another Convention&mdash;&s;urely no<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this time the States of North-Carolina and Rhode|I&s;land had not acceded to the general Government.</NOTE> &s;tate ought to have rejected it

without pondering well on the con&s;equences. Becau&s;e, enarchy and civil war, with an eventual government of chance or force, appeared but too probable con&s;equen|ces of a general rejection.</P>
<P>UNDER &s;uch circum&s;tances, it was doubtle&s;s the part of wi&s;dom to adopt the Con&s;titution. I pretend to no un|u&s;ual fore&s;ight into futurity, and therefore cannot un|dertake to decide what may be its ultimate fate. If a promi&s;ed good &s;hould terminate in an unexpected evil, it would not be a &s;olitary example of di&s;appointment. If the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven &s;howered thick around us, &s;hould be &s;pilled on the ground, or converted to cur&s;es, through the fault of tho&s;e for who&s;e u&s;e they were prof|fered, it would not be the fir&s;t in&s;tance of folly or per|ver&s;ene&s;s in &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals. The ble&s;&s;ed religion, revealed in the word of God, will remain an eternal and awful monument, to prove that the be&s;t in&s;titutions may be abu&s;ed by human depravity; and that they may even, in &s;ome in&s;tances, be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the vile&s;t of purpo&s;es, Should hereafter, tho&s;e who are in|tru&s;ted with the management of this government, in|cited by the lu&s;t of domination, and prompted by the &s;upinene&s;s or venality of their con&s;tituents, break down the barriers of this Con&s;titution, and trample on the pro&s;|trated rights of humanity: it will only &s;erve to &s;hew, that no compact among men, however provident in its con&s;truction, and &s;acred in its ratification, can be pro|nounced everla&s;ting and inviolable&mdash;and, if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s my&s;elf&mdash;that no wall of words&mdash;that no mound of parchment, can be &s;o formed as to &s;tand again&s;t the &s;weeping torrent of boundle&s;s ambition on the one &s;ide,
<PB N="343" REF="022578_0342_0FB995CEA1BCAC48">
aided by the &s;apping current of corrupted morals on the other. But until the people of America &s;hall have lo&s;t all virtue; until they &s;hall have become totally in&s;en|&s;ible to the differences between liberty and &s;lavery, un|til they &s;hall have been reduced to &s;uch poverty of &s;pi|rit as to be willing to &s;ell that pre-eminent ble&s;&s;ing of rational beings, the <HI>birth-right of freedom;</HI> in &s;hort, un|til they &s;hall have been found incapable of governing them&s;elves, and ripe for a ma&s;ter&mdash;the&s;e con&s;equences, &s;hould fondly hope, can never arrive.&mdash;</P>
<P>I PROCEED now, in the order propo&s;ed, to treat of the head that was re&s;erved for the conclu&s;ion of this di&s;|cour&s;e: I mean, the national pro&s;perity which we may rea&s;onably expect will re&s;ult from the faithful admini|&s;tration of this government. My chief de&s;ign, in men|tioning a few circum&s;tances eminently calculated to pro|mote our happine&s;s as a people, is, to increa&s;e a di&s;po|&s;ition to make the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible u&s;e of tho&s;e circum&s;tan|ces. Can there be any pur&s;uit more con&s;onant to the dictates of rea&s;on and nature, than that who&s;e object is the promotion of the happine&s;s of our Country? To embrace this object in its utmo&s;t limit, our imaginations mu&s;t expand with the dimen&s;ions of a Continent, and extend with the revolutions of futurity.</P>
<P>THE preliminary ob&s;ervation, that a free government ought to be founded on the information and morals of the people, will here find its proper place. Happily our citizens are remarkably in&s;tructed by education, docile to duty, and ingenious for making improvements. More knowledge is, perhaps, at this moment diffu&s;ed among
<PB N="344" REF="022578_0343_0FB995D150656728">
them, than among any other people under Heaven. The conduct and i&s;&s;ue of the late war may be a criterion to decide, whether they are de&s;titute of wi&s;dom in the ca|binet, or fortitude in the field. For inve&s;tigation of the rights of man, for ingenuity in applying principles al|ready di&s;covered to works of mechani&s;m, for inventions in u&s;eful arts, and for re&s;earches in &s;everal branches of philo&s;ophy, few have gone before them. Even for ef|forts of genius, in &s;ome of the finer arts, they are thought, by the be&s;t judges, &s;carcely to have been excelled in the pre&s;ent age. The world has applauded their public writings, for the good &s;en&s;e and manly diction by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed. Yet it is not for us, who claim no more than to be upon a level with our fellow-men, to encourage one another in entertaining too high an opinion of our&s;elves. It is enough, that we do not feel a degrading con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of belonging to that inferior cla&s;s of mortals, in which &s;ome of the Philo&s;ophers of Europe have had the pre&s;umption to place us. On the contrary, peculiar fields of nature and contemplation are peculiarly favorable to the expan&s;ion of the human pow|ers. If we po&s;&s;e&s;s any grandeur of &s;oul, any penetra|tion of thought, any combination for project; the great &s;cenes of nature with which we are &s;urrounded, and the great political drama in which we are required to take a part, will call them into action. When wereflect up|on our relative &s;ituation, we cannot con&s;ider our&s;elves as members of a petty community, or as being acting for a fleeting moment. We are not, like many of the European States, limited to our pre&s;ent numbers. Though it &s;hould be the primary object of our rulers to promote the immediate felicity of a nation, as &s;ingular in its ori|gin
<PB N="345" REF="022578_0344_0FB995D363F96960">
as new to political life; yet they cannot forget, that the happine&s;s of countle&s;s millions who are to draw their fir&s;t breath in America may depend, in a great de|gree, on the di&s;cipline, in&s;titutions and examples of this generation. For certain it is, the population of our country mu&s;t encrea&s;e almo&s;t beyond the power of cal|culation. The &s;tream of people, wave propelling wave, mu&s;t, with the lap&s;e of years, roll back to the lake of the woods. From our geographical po&s;ition, it is not for kings and parliaments, with their a&s;&s;umed omnipo|tence, to &s;top tho&s;e waves in their proper cour&s;e. It is not for impolitic princes, vainly checking our com|merce for momentary gain, to prevent us from becom|ing a commercial, a rich, and a powerful people. Had they really a de&s;ign of accompli&s;hing this&mdash;it would be advi&s;able to begin with annihilating our natural ad|vantages, with drying up our innumerable navigable ri|vers, and with &s;terili&s;ing the uncommon fertility of our &s;oil.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE benign effects, which, in all human probability, will be produced by the faithful admini&s;tration of this government, mu&s;t not be entirely pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence, though they can be but imperfectly noticed. Hitherto, for want of an efficient government, the felicities that were pro|mi&s;ed by our &s;ituation, and the advantages that were ex|pected from our Independence, have not equalled our hopes. The harve&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings, &s;own in fields fattened with the blood of heroes, hath mocked our expectations. But under the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, being uncommonly protected in our per&s;ons and our acqui&s;itions, we &s;hall have uncommonly favorable opportunities for encrea&s;|ing
<PB N="346" REF="022578_0345_0FB995D5A99D6970">
and enjoying our natural re&s;ources. We have pur|cha&s;ed wi&s;dom by experience. Though mankind are believed to be aver&s;e to the coertions of government; yet no &s;ooner had our countrymen felt the inconveni|ences ari&s;ing from the feeblene&s;s of our former confede|ration, than they &s;eemed willing to inve&s;t a new Con|gre&s;s with a farther portion of their original rights, for the purpo&s;e of being more fully protected in the enjoy|ment of the remainder. Thus the di&s;po&s;itions our Coun|trymen have been gradually matured to receive an ener|getic government. Heaven be thanked that we have liv|ed to &s;ee its wonders, in our native land not le&s;s in dark|ne&s;s and tempe&s;t, than in &s;un&s;hine and ferenity! Now the clouds, that ob&s;cured our political horizon, are bur&s;t|ing away. The dawn of happine&s;s begins to appear. We cannot refrain from experiencing the con&s;olatory joys of futurity, in contemplating the immen&s;e de&s;erts, yet untrodden by the foot of man, &s;oon to become fair as the garden of God, &s;oon to be animated by the acti|vity of multitudes, and &s;oon to be made vocal with the prai&s;es of the MOST HIGH. Can it be imagined that &s;o many peculiar advantages, of &s;oil and of climate; for agriculture, for navigation, and eventually for manufac|tures, were lavi&s;hed in vain&mdash;or that this va&s;t continent was not created and re&s;erved &s;o long undi&s;covered, as a Theatre for tho&s;e glorious di&s;plays of Divine power and goodne&s;s, the &s;alutary con&s;equences of which will flow to another Hemi&s;phere, and extend through the intermi|nable &s;eries of ages! Should not our &s;ouls exult in the pro&s;pect?&mdash;Though we &s;hall not &s;urvive to perceive, with the&s;e bodily &s;en&s;es, but a &s;mall portion of the ble&s;&s;ed effects which our revolution will occa&s;ion in the re&s;t of
<PB N="347" REF="022578_0346_0FB995D729705278">
the world; yet we may enjoy the progre&s;s of human &s;oci|ety, and human happine&s;s, in anticipation.&mdash;We may re|joice in a belief, that intellectual light will yet illumi|nate the dark corners of the earth; that freedom of en|quiry will produce liberality of conduct; that mankind will rever&s;e the ab&s;urd po&s;ition, that the <HI>many</HI> were made for the <HI>few:</HI> and that they will not continue &s;laves in one quarter of the globe, when they can become free men in another.</P>
<P>WITH &s;uch animating pro&s;pects before us; with a &s;pirit of indu&s;try becoming every day more prevalent; with habits of oeconomy, fir&s;t prompted by nece&s;&s;ity, now acquiring force from fa&s;hion; with di&s;po&s;itions that a reverence for public and private ju&s;tice &s;hould form the ba&s;is of our national character&mdash;we only wanted a good government, well admini&s;tered, to e&s;tabli&s;h our happi|ne&s;s at home and our re&s;pectability abroad. This is the time for fixing our national character and national man|ners. For this purpo&s;e, the integrity, the talents and the examples of &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of illu&s;trious per|&s;onages, as tho&s;e who are now employed in the general government were highly requi&s;ite. Notwith&s;tanding the unanimous &s;uffrage of our countrymen in favor of the Supreme Magi&s;trate, &s;uper&s;edes the propriety of my mentioning the circum&s;tances of his coming again into public life, the &s;entiments entertained of his character, and the benefits expected from his admini&s;tration; yet I may be allowed to &s;ay, that no &s;election of Sages, in this or any other country, ever merited the confidence of their fellow citizens more than the members of the pre&s;ent Congre&s;s. If then the body of worthy citizens
<PB N="348" REF="022578_0347_0FB995DC32614720">
will co-operate with the general and &s;tate governments, in endeavors to promote the public felicity; if the mini&s;ters of religion will exert them&s;elves in their holy functions to di&s;&s;eminate peace and good-will among men; if the executive officers of government will not bear the &s;word of ju&s;tice in vain, but be a terror to evil doers and a prai&s;e to &s;uch as &s;hall do well: we may congra|tulate our&s;elves upon having lived at &s;o important a period; and &s;een the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a government, calculated to promote the permanent pro&s;perity and glo|ry of our nation.</P>
