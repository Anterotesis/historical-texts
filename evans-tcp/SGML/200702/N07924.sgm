<HEAD>Brief REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of the Halifax letter, who now affects to call him&s;elf only the editor, begins his defence with "a &s;erene and compo&s;ed &s;urvey of a &s;torm, taken in a calm, after the tumult of the waves had &s;ub&s;ided." This is a &s;peci|men of the methodical di&s;po&s;ition of his ideas, and of the regularity and clearne&s;s of his modes of think|ing. He gives us a flouri&s;h on the "blood and im|men&s;e trea&s;ure of her &s;ubjects that Great-Britain has lavi&s;hed for the &s;ecurity of the colonies, as well as her own importance and dignity." Were none of tho&s;e &s;ubjects Americans? Was no part of tho&s;e im|men&s;e &s;ums rai&s;ed by the northern colonies? It is ac|knowledged with gratitude, and hath very generally impre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t &s;entiments of duty and loyalty, that his pre&s;ent and late Maje&s;ty, with their re&s;pec|tive parliaments, were graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give the colonies far greater protection, &s;upport and encou|ragement, than had ever been received from all the Princes their royal predece&s;&s;ors together. But our notable editor &s;hould not have forgotten that the&s;e colonies ever di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by the mo&s;t unbounded loyalty. Their inviolable attachment to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment in his Maje&s;ty's illu&s;trious family; their love to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution and go|vernment, from which, under God, they derive their greate&s;t happine&s;s, have been, at all times, acknow|ledged
<PB N="4" REF="010116_0003_0F7CE91F67FB2350">
by &s;ome of the mo&s;t inveterate of their ene|mies. That the northern colonies on the continent have ever exerted their mo&s;t &s;trenuous efforts in the common cau&s;e of the whole empire, will not be de|nied but by tho&s;e who are fearle&s;s of ridicule, and intirely lo&s;t to any &s;en&s;e of honor or &s;hame. I will al&s;o venture to affirm, they will be ever found ready on any future occa&s;ion, to convince tho&s;e of their mi&s;takes, who may entertain any kind of doubt of their loyalty. I believe there were few &s;o terrified and alarmed, even in the&s;e dark and gloomy days of the American commanders preceding an Amher&s;t, a Wolfe and a Monkton, as to have "gladly compoun|ded for a barrier at Albany." It was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that a change of Generals would bring on &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial a change of mea&s;ures, as at lea&s;t, to &s;ecure his Maje&s;ty's ancient territories. The event of things happily proved this, and a great deal more. I remem|ber tho&s;e days, and own I was one who was greatly terrified and alarmed at the rapid progre&s;s the French were &s;uffered to make, while ten thou&s;and of the be&s;t troops in the world were kept parading at Hali|fax, and &s;pent the &s;ummer in mock-battles and &s;ieges. If the editor then had his re&s;idence there, I pre&s;ume he was well plea&s;ed to &s;ee the Briti&s;h forces &s;o wi&s;ely employed, while the Canadians were bringing fire and &s;word into the bowels of the continent. I am pretty certain, he and all tho&s;e of his &s;tamp in Ame|rica, would have been grieved at an Albany barrier, for this plain rea&s;on; they were in hopes to join in chanting <HI>Te Deum</HI> with their French Catholic Brethren in the churches, chapels and meeting-hou&s;es of Bo&s;ton, New-York and Newport. Upon all oc|ca&s;ions, during the war, they manife&s;ted their joy and exultation at any little &s;ucce&s;s of the French&mdash;

but kept vigils and &s;evere fa&s;ts when they were drub|bed. The Halifaxian is at this time very intimate with a &s;et of gentry who are in combination to vil|ify the colonies, and depreciate every &s;ervice they have rendered the crown. He is at no lo&s;s any ev'|ning to find &s;ome <HI>of his old gang,</HI> who, if fame &s;peaks true, as I believe &s;he does for once, have crack'd many a bottle of true &s;terling to the health of J&mdash;m-y S&mdash;t, as the&s;e pretty lads call him when they are about half &s;eas over, and imagine them&s;elves out of danger. Such is the little, dirty, drinking, drabbing, contaminated knot of thieves, beggars and tran&s;ports, or the worthy de&s;cendents of &s;uch, collected from the four winds of the earth, and made up of Turks, Jews and other Infidels, with a few renegado Chri|&s;tians &amp; Catholics, and altogether formed into a club of &s;carce a dozen, at N&mdash;p&mdash;t. From hence proceed Halifax-letters, petitions to alter the colony forms of government, libels upon all good coloni&s;ts and &s;ub|jects, and every evil work that can enter into the heart of man. The&s;e are &s;ome of the gentry, who all of a &s;udden are become the mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects in Ame|rica; and have had the impudence to attempt to per|&s;uade all England that the re&s;t of the coloni&s;ts are as great rebels as ever appeared in arms for the Preten|der, not excepting tho&s;e choice friends, of, that learn|ed apothecary and barber-&s;urgeon of a man of war Dr. Smallbrain, the lying hi&s;toriographer, of the fir&s;t expedition to Loui&s;bourg, whom he has bro't the <HI>beau monde</HI> to call the <HI>in&s;urgents</HI> of 1745. Our edi|tor and his adherents, have from time to time, in the NewportMercury and el&s;ewhere <HI>&s;ub ro&s;a</HI> talked pretty loudly of "dragooning the coloni&s;ts into better manners," and &s;aid, "G&mdash;d d&mdash;m their blood, they &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee the difference between martial and

The&s;e are two cant terms of the <HI>junto</HI> for meeting-hou&s;es and prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters.

<P>I &s;hould not have thought the above vain threats worth citing, but as they &s;how what a ble&s;&s;ed advo|cate any admini&s;tration hath in the editor and his <HI>junto.</HI> What an opinion &s;hould we have of our &s;u|periors, if, which God forbid, it were to be formed from what we know of the&s;e wretches? Should the editor think it again&s;t the laws of Polemicks to apply to him, or the Halifax letter-writter, who cho&s;e to be anonymous, even what I know hath been &s;aid by divers of the <HI>junto,</HI> let him recollect that the &s;ame editor in the defence of the letter&punc; hath not only
<PB N="7" REF="010116_0006_0F7CE922E1BFC158">
made the writer of the vindication of the colonies an&s;werable for every thing that hath been thought, &s;poken, written, printed or publi&s;hed in America, <HI>an|ticatholicon,</HI> for &s;everal years pa&s;t. He hath without &s;ufficient authority, affirmed, that the author of the <HI>Rights of the Briti&s;h colonies a&s;&s;erted and proved,</HI> and the writer of their <HI>Vindication</HI> again&s;t the editor's foul a&s;per&s;ions, is the &s;ame per&s;on. This, if true, he did not know, and therefore in <HI>foro con&s;cientiae</HI> approxi|mates to lee&s;ing-making. Does this &s;how his hu|mane and &s;erenely &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition of avoiding any thing that looks like a per&s;onal conte&s;t. He certainly mu&s;t be lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of honor, or when he was not only treated like a gentleman, but with infinitely more lenity than he de&s;erved, and nothing &s;aid that could be called naming him, he would not have u&s;ed this expre&s;&s;ion, "The rights of the Briti&s;h colonies a&s;&s;erted, of which this Bo&s;ton writer was the author." This is certainly equivalent to naming who he thinks the writer of the Vindication, as the author of the Rights a&s;&s;erted gave his name to the public. Not content with this, he has made the writer of the Vindication an&s;werable for pieces which he declares he never &s;aw, 'till he read them in the de|fence. He has made him intimate with gentlemen he never heard of, and confederate with wri|ters he never gue&s;&s;ed at. The writer of the Vindi|cation has more than once &s;aid in my hearing, "that he knows not any more than the dead who that Providence writer" is, but he believes him to be a match for all the Jacobites &amp; Jew-jobbers in Newport.</P>
<P>With regard to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, I &s;olemnly declare, and defy the Editor to prove the contrary, and I have heard the author of the Rights of the Briti&s;h colonies a&s;&s;erted, &s;ay as much, I never was
<PB N="8" REF="010116_0007_0F7CE923478F9F88">
directly nor indirectly concerned in, or knowing to the compo&s;ing or publi&s;hing of one pamphlet or other piece, by the Editor cited, or any other, except the Rights of the Colonies a&s;&s;erted, and the Vindica|tion, of which I own I was the publi&s;her, and the author of the fir&s;t is well known; and if there is any thing offen&s;ive in either, I am heartily &s;orry, and am well a&s;&s;ured the author never intended any &s;uch thing, and has given me authority in his name, humbly to a&s;k pardon for the lea&s;t iota that may have di&s;plea&s;ed his &s;uperiors, humbly imploring as he at fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ed his diffidence of him&s;elf, that they would candidly impute any &s;lip to the "agony of his heart, rather than to the pravity of his will." I as much di&s;approve of many things that have been publi&s;hed, as the Editor pretends to. But in a point of &s;uch importance, and in regulations at lea&s;t new, is it to be wondered at, that there &s;hould be &s;ome diver|&s;ity of &s;entiments? Should any imprudencies have e&s;caped any, all "candid Philanthropes," but &s;uch as the Editor, will make benevolent allowances for, tho&s;e who have been born and bred in the wilds of Ame|rica, and have had little opportunity to learn the Eu|ropean urbanity and manners, unle&s;s they could take them from a few &s;trollers, &s;traggling pedlars &amp; tran&s;|ports, which were the principal &s;chool-ma&s;ters of polite|ne&s;s the letter writer conver&s;ed with, before the late war, &s;ince the opening of which, many fine gentlemen have vi&s;ited the colonies. As the country becomes poli&s;hed, I hope it will grow in virtue and good manners &amp; avoid the lea&s;t appearance of any thing that may offend. The colonies have been long indulged with a more ample &s;ubordinate legi&s;lation, than the wi&s;dom of admini&s;tration thinks the good of the whole Empire will admit of their enjoying any longer.

on Great-Britain was never tho't of, much le&s;s wi&s;hed for or de&s;ired. During the la&s;t war, his late and pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty were graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to avail them&s;elves of all the aids in the power of their loyal &s;ubjects the northern coloni&s;ts, by the royal requi&s;itions &s;ignified by their re&s;pective mini&s;ters of &s;tate, to the &s;eve|ral provincial a&s;&s;emblies. In con&s;equence of the&s;e, and of our lives and fortunes being ever devoted to their Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, men from time to time were chear|fully rai&s;ed, and monies granted by the provincial repre&s;entatives of the people, who in reflecting on the honour and happine&s;s of being enabled to &s;erve their King &amp; country in this way, had al&s;o the plea&s;ure of contemplating their own importance in &s;ociety.&mdash;No di&s;agreeable &s;entiment this, even to the "good and virtuous men" of the Editor's acquaintance, if <HI>many</HI> &s;uch there are. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the provincial a&s;|&s;emblies for the future, will probably be confined to the "little low local affairs of their petty corpo|rations," as they are con&s;idered by the Editor. A very great friend of the colonies, as he is plea&s;ed to &s;tyle him&s;elf, in a late M. Gazette, has carried the matter &s;o far, as to &s;ay in effect, that the American colonies are of no more importance, than the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Africa.&mdash;That the inhabitants of Cape-Coa&s;t-Ca&s;tle&punc; who may not con&s;i&s;t of more than a captain, two &s;ubalterns, fifty non-commi&s;&s;ion officers and privates, ten &s;trumpets and their brats, have as much pretence to hope to be be indulged with returning members of parliament as all N. America, which has at this pre&s;ent writing, nearly as many inhabitants as there are in Scotland or Ireland, more than three millions of which are whites, and as great a proportion of them, as in any part of the Briti&s;h empire, without any reflection,

true and loyal &s;ubjects, who fear God, honour the King, reverence his parliament, and daily pray for the pro&s;perity of Great-Britain. Am I a man, and mu&s;t not &s;peak? Tears relieve me a moment! Thank God there is no law humane or divine, again&s;t treating a Halifax letter-writer as he de|&s;erves. Tho' &s;ome of the colonies &s;hould not in all things think with the very ingenious, learned, polite and delicate writer of a pamphlet intitled, <HI>Regulati|ons lately made concerning the colonies, and the taxes impo&s;ed on them con&s;idered;</HI> yet none but the bigoted N&mdash;t Editor would thence infer, that all the continent of America were about to become <HI>in&s;urgents.</HI> As there cannot be the lea&s;t doubt but the views of ad|mini&s;tration are intentionally the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t; &s;o the law pre&s;umes with me, that they are really &s;o on the whole. We at this di&s;tance can &s;ee but very im|perfectly. Tis the duty of all humbly and &s;ilently to acquie&s;ce in all the deci&s;ions of the &s;upreme legi&s;la|tive. I will, however, pre&s;ume to utter one &s;hort prophecy, namely, that nine hundred and ninety nine in a thou&s;and of the colonies, will never once entertain a thought but of the mo&s;t profound duti|ful and loyal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience to the wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s of our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign, and to the authority of parliament, in all ca&s;es and po&s;&s;ible contingencies. Any informations of a con|trary di&s;po&s;ition in the coloni&s;ts, tran&s;mitted from America, upon a &s;trict enquiry, will be found to be at lea&s;t very great mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>I have mentioned the pamphlet, intitled, <HI>Regula|tions, &amp;c.</HI> but as a friend of mine, who is much plea&s;ed with that performance, and at his lei&s;ure, is preparing a critical and candid review of it, with a &s;incere de&s;ign to conciliate as far as po&s;&s;ible every

man in America to the &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures there di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, it is needle&s;s to make many ob&s;erva|tions on it here, e&s;pecially as the bare naming it in a day, much more any compari&s;on be|tween that and the Halifax letter, will, I fear, be con&s;idered as an outrageous affront to the real merit of the European, if &s;o, I a&s;k his pardon for it. The reader will there find the coloni&s;ts, not only treated like men, but gentlemen, and Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.&mdash;None of your Draconic laws, nor inqui&s;itorial grid-irons to broil hereticks on, are li&s;p'd, or I believe tho't of, much le&s;s openly threatned and wi&s;hed for, as by the Halifaxian.&mdash;We &s;ee the traces of genius in every &s;entence, often in the choice of a &s;ingle letter in the alphabet.&mdash;The tenderne&s;s of a parent, the prudence of a Ne&s;tor, the legi&s;lative &s;kill of a Solon, and a Lycurgus are di&s;played, in&s;tead of the rage, malice and fury of an Ore&s;tes, tearing out the bowels of his mother, &s;tabbing his &s;i&s;ter, killing his own &s;ons and his daughters, and plucking out his own eyes; all which are very faint traits of the madne&s;s of the Halifaxian. In the European we al&s;o find a perfect knowledge of our con&s;titution, laws, political intere&s;ts, internal police, and &s;tate of trade and commerce thro' the globe.&mdash;Of all this in the Halifaxian, verily nothing. The European tells us, we are a part, an e&s;&s;ential part of the empire of Great Britain, and a beloved part, entitled to every benefit of the be&s;t con&s;titution on earth. The Halifax Tar|tar will not allow his countrymen any greater rights and privileges than the Creoles allow the Ethiopians, or his brother Sythians afford their captives. <HI>Quic|quid e&s;t vocis ac linguae omne in i&s;tum turpi&s;&s;imum calumniae que&s;tum contuli&s;ti!

What little &s;kill you have in the ma|nagement of your voice, hath been employed in &s;ing &s;ong, as your pen hath been in &s;canda|lizing your country. Dare you behold the light? Dare you face the forum, the city and the a&s;&s;embly of your injured fellow-countrymen?" I &s;hall pa&s;s over what the Editor &s;ays of the Providence writer, as he calls him, and of the honourable gentleman, except where he has bro't the Vindication in que&s;tion. Tho&s;e gentlemen are able to defend them&s;elves a|gain&s;t this doughty champion for Great-Britain, as he vainly &s;tiles him&s;elf. The Editor, in order to &s;up|port his charge again&s;t the colonies, of di&s;loyalty and di&s;affection to Great Britain, has been grubbing up all the little pieces that have been publi&s;hed in any of the News-Papers on the continent. He will have it again, contrary to what he mu&s;t know to be true, that "numberle&s;s pamphlets" have been publi&s;hed upon the occa&s;ion. If prior to the Halifax letter, he can name above four, and one &s;ince be&s;ides the Vindication again&s;t him, I will give him the weight in gold of all that have been publi&s;hed. This dic|tator has given the author of the &s;entiments of a Bri|ti&s;h North-American, a place in his black catalogue. The Editor's grand charge is again&s;t the motto of this piece, taken from Phaedrus, which being only a fable of an old man and his a&s;s, &s;urely none but a jack-a&s;s could have been offended at it. Phae|drus could be no offender again&s;t the &s;tatutes of G.B. Phaedrus was certainly no &s;ubject of Great Britain, nor could he know any thing of her munici|pal laws and cu&s;toms. But the trea&s;on is not in

the motto it &s;eems, but "the application of the above fable to the &s;ubject of taxing the colonies, &s;hews clearly the author's opinion, that under the pre&s;ent parliamentary regulations, it is matter of in|difference what Prince we are &s;ubject to, whether a George or a Lewis, as a certain gentleman expre&s;&s;ed it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Halifax defence, p 8.</NOTE> The humanity and philanthropy of this attack on a gentleman who has been long in a very ill &s;tate of health, and now unable to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, is very remarkable. What an eagle-eyed fellow is this Editor, and would be governor, at e&s;pying plots, trea&s;on and rebellion, in all but his own club? Be|cau&s;e Phaedrus his a&s;s tho't it a matter of indifference who&s;e pack &s;he carried, therefore the <HI>North American</HI> is of opinion, that it is a matter of indifference what prince or power we are &s;ubject to, whether a George or a Lewis. This is exactly of a piece with the law, the truth, the &s;incerity, the logic and philanthropy of the Editor in his other productions. As to the allu|&s;ion of George and Lewis, the author of the Senti|ments has no concern in it.&mdash;'Tis &s;uppo&s;ed to relate to an expre&s;&s;ion wilfully mi&s;repre&s;ented by the Editor, and was very different from the manner in which it is cited. Tho&s;e who plea&s;e may &s;ee the whole &s;tory in the vindication of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of M.

The con&s;titution, rea&s;on, the nature of &s;overeignty and of a &s;upreme legi&s;lative, all concur to make it nece&s;&s;arily the duty of all &s;ubjects to acquie&s;ce in the pre&s;umption that even the inmo&s;t intentions of the &s;upreme power, have ever for their favourite object the good of the whole community.

being in &s;hort the dernier re&s;ort for law &amp; ju&s;tice, there can be no appeal from it, as there would be if private opinions and interpretations could have any authori|ty, or were allowed to be &s;et up and con&s;idered as of any weight in the &s;cale again&s;t it. But general rules hinder not, nor were de&s;igned to prevent mo|de&s;t and humble enquiries after truth and rea&s;on. Should this be the ca&s;e, it would tend much to &s;top the progre&s;s of all human improvement. The Editor to be &s;ure is bound by his conce&s;&s;ion, that the <HI>rea|&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of mea&s;ures may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, this is <HI>argu|mentum ad hominem</HI> as to him, and &s;hould not be taken back. We have better authority than his, I mean among others, the opinion of the author of the <HI>New Regulations con&s;idered,</HI> who, I am certain, is &s;o fair and hone&s;t an enquirer after truth, that he would be freely willing others &s;hould enquire for them&s;elves, as well as he. If none were to enquire into the rea&s;on and meaning of laws, we &s;hould have no judges nor lawyers, unle&s;s perhaps &s;uch as the Editor. I have ever tho't that the whole &s;cience of law, and the fair and ju&s;t practice of it, was found|ed in the &s;tudy, interpretation and right application and execution of the rea&s;on, meaning and intention of the laws, and con&s;equently of the legi&s;lative. There is nothing in all this that can in the lea&s;t impeach their power, right and authority to make laws. To apply this rea&s;oning to the pre&s;ent times, the author of the book called the new regulations, &amp;c. is of opinion with me "that the colonies are ju&s;tly bound by all acts of parliament wherein they are named." That the parliament have a "clear, ju&s;t equitable and lawful authority, from the nature of a &s;upreme legi&s;lative or &s;overeign power of a &s;tate, and by the Briti&s;h con&s;titution in particular, to im|po&s;e

We mu&s;t not plead poverty till there is an end of the &s;candalous con&s;umption of Holland's Tea, and We&s;t-India produce in this country. The bane of the northern colonies has been Holland and We&s;t-India goods. With regard to &s;ome of tho&s;e of New England, there has been another very impoveri&s;hing drain, &mdash;they have ever bought great part of their bread, and it &s;eems at pre&s;ent impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade them even to attempt to rai&s;e it.

<P>I have had &s;ome peculiar opportunities to get the exact number of the inhabitants, and am as well informed as I think po&s;&s;ible, of the quantity of wool.

impo&s;ed upon me of clearing my&s;elf from a contra|diction, or the heinous crime of retracting my er|rors, when convinced of them, which la&s;t &s;eems in the opinion of the Editor, to be by far the mo&s;t aggravated tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the two, tho' he is plea&s;|ed to give a &s;neering commendation, which has much more of the hi&s;&s;ing and grinning of Pandemonium, than the angelic joy &s;hown on the return of a prodigal, or penitence of any other &s;inner. I will now &s;hew not only that the Editor has not pointed out any contradiction in the Vindication, but al&s;o that it is po&s;itively con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and al&s;o with the doc|trine advanced in the Rights of the colonies a&s;&s;erted, and with the truth. The Editor has not pretended to cite any pa&s;&s;age, either from the Rights a&s;&s;erted, or the Vindication, again&s;t him, that contains any thing that is an expre&s;s denial or even a direct que&s;tion of the ju&s;t power right and authority of the parliament over the colonies. He cites the former part of the pa&s;&s;age above-mentioned, page 22, and compares it with the&s;e words taken from the Rights of the colo|nies a&s;&s;erted, "When the parliament &s;hall think fit to <HI>allow</HI> the coloni&s;ts a repre&s;entation (i. e. as the Editor takes it, and as it was meant) a repre&s;entation in fact in the hou&s;e of commons, the equity of their taxing the colonies will be as clear as their power is at pre&s;ent of doing it without, if they plea&s;e." Now let the Editor keep &s;ight of the dictinction he made, which I grant is a ju&s;t one, and almo&s;t the only one I have known him make, and his difficulty to recon|cile me mu&s;t vani&s;h.

The &s;afe&s;t way in &s;uch a ca&s;e is humbly to acquie&s;ce in the deci&s;ions of parliament, and the di&s;po&s;als of providence. This I mo&s;t &s;incerely and without re|&s;erve do, and advi&s;e all men to do the &s;ame. The &s;upreme legi&s;lative of Great-Britain, and the do|minions, if the &s;tamp act is pa&s;&s;ed, relating to Ame|rica, have, as they have an undoubted right to do, impo&s;ed internal as well as external taxes on us, and as they have tho't it expedient, rea&s;onable, nay ab&s;olutly nece&s;&s;ary, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances and exigencies of the &s;tate, laboring under a debt of 130 millions. I wi&s;h, and begin to hope, it may on the whole be for the intere&s;t of all parts of the Empire.</P>
<P>But with regard to the Editor, I would a&s;k him, if while a bill is pending, arguments may be urged from <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> expediency, &amp;c. for or again&s;t it, why not from equity, equality and inequality? May not the propriety or impropriety of a mea&s;ure be go|verned by the equity, rea&s;onable equality, or unrea|&s;onable inequality. This is all I contend for, which is &s;hort of the Editor's claim, who re&s;erves the li|berty of writing and publi&s;hing, for any thing that appears, after a bill is pa&s;&s;ed the parliament, which is more than I think ought to be allow'd with the great freedom at lea&s;t, which he contends for. My rea&s;on is, &s;uch freedoms allow'd, with regard to the right, exerci&s;e of a juri&s;diction, in par|ticular in&s;tances, would bring government, and all courts into contempt. If the editor therefore thinks I have been incon&s;i&s;tent, he mu&s;t think he has been much more &s;o, as I &s;hall &s;hew in the in|&s;tance of the per&s;ecution he complains &s;o loudly of as an infringement of his liberty and the liberty of the pre&s;s.

The &s;cene changes, the general a&s;&s;embly re&s;ent the in&s;ult, the printer is &s;ent for, I &s;uppo&s;e more to frighten him than any thing el&s;e; the champion Editor fell into panics which he has not got rid of &s;ince. The affair was managed with candor, the governor not appearing, which I &s;uppo&s;e was the rea&s;on that the lieutenant-governor, who was not &s;o immediately attacked, pre&s;ided. After a rea|&s;onable &s;weating, the printer was very prudently per|mitted to return to his beloved trembling Editor. In&s;tantly the Newport-Mercury began the vindicati|on of injured <HI>liberty and property.</HI> The <HI>tribunitian</HI> veto then &s;ounded as loud in this notable paper, as formerly the <HI>clanking</HI> of chains and the marching of <HI>dragoons.</HI> But this la&s;ted only three or four weeks, when the noble courage of the Editor revived again, and having found his great independent &s;oul, which on this tragical occa&s;ion, fame &s;ays lay two or three days hid in a hay-mow or a hen-roo&s;t, he &s;et about his defence, in which he de&s;cribes with &s;erene plea|&s;ure his hair-breadth e&s;cape. It will be at lea&s;t grant|ed to be po&s;&s;ible, that the general a&s;&s;emblies have a ju&s;t power and lawful authority to commit for contempt. If they have &s;uch a right, I rea&s;on thus from Martinus again&s;t M-r-t-n and company.&mdash; The a&s;&s;embly had a good, clear, ju&s;t and equita|ble right, power and authority to have committed

If they had &s;o committed them, it could not have been complained of as again&s;t ju&s;tice or equity, they having a right to commit. But yet a commitment would have been again&s;t rea&s;on and pru|dence, as it might either have made them too con&s;i|derable, or have cramped the liberty of the pre&s;s. The end being an&s;wered as it was hoped by the pannic, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. What is there contradictory in all this? What is there wrong but the Editor's &s;till per&s;i&s;ting to abu&s;e a government that has di&s;co|vered &s;o much lenity towards him? Sure I am, that if my &s;uperiors in Europe or America have taken any umbrage at any thing I have &s;aid or written, I am &s;orry for it, and whether they forgive me or not, I promi&s;e I will do my utmo&s;t not only never to of|fend them again, but in all things try to convince them I am not the man, the malice and ill-will of &s;ome have induced them to repre&s;ent me. I have been &s;o large in proving that the Editor has not &s;hewn any incon&s;i&s;tency in me, that mo&s;t I flatter my&s;elf will be of the mind, I have proved that the whole I have advanced on the &s;ubject is con&s;i&s;tent. But to convince all, even the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate, I mu&s;t offer a word or two more. The pa&s;&s;age cited by the Editor above, taken with the context and whole tenor of the book, and if the Editor plea&s;es with the <HI>Rights of the colonies a&s;&s;erted</HI> too, prove that the argu|ment was placed, not on a denial or &s;ugge&s;tion of the want of power and authority in the parliament to tax the colonies. All that I ever pretended was, that an American return of members &s;eemed to me but a rea&s;onable indulgence, upon the exerci&s;e, or rather re&s;umption into their own hands, of that part

of &s;upreme legi&s;lation which, con&s;i&s;ts in rai&s;ing taxes for the &s;upport of government, the protection and defence of the whole empire. I never &s;aid nor tho't the coloni&s;ts could demand or claim <HI>ex debito ju&s;titiae,</HI> as Lord Coke has it, an actual repre&s;entation in the hou&s;e of commons. Upon the rea&s;onablene&s;s of an actual American repre&s;entation I placed my foot, and built my only hope and de&s;ire, and that not for my&s;elf, nor for the Americans only, but becau&s;e I thought it would be for the intere&s;t of the whole empire, and be one means of an&s;wering &s;ome very great purpo&s;es, and among others, that of mo&s;t perfectly conciliating the obedience and reve|rence of every individual in the empire to the &s;u|preme legi&s;lative of Great-Britain, a grand object, which has been ju&s;tly tho't worthy the views and contemplation of Maje&s;ty it&s;elf, and is by our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign accordingly recommended for the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his greate&s;t council, in his la&s;t &s;peech, from the throne, truly worthy a Briti&s;h-born Prince, and a patriot King.</P>
<P>It was determined in parliament la&s;t year that ex|ternal taxes &s;hould be rai&s;ed on the coloni&s;ts. I &s;uppo&s;e that internal taxes are granted and impo&s;ed before now. This it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee any time the&s;e &s;even years would &s;oon be the ca&s;e. It is in|conte&s;table that we are virtually and in law repre|&s;ented in the hou&s;e of commons, and in the whole parliament. But after all this, there may be a que&s;|tion, whenever the admini&s;tration &s;hall plea&s;e to make one of it, namely, whether notwith&s;tanding the undoubted power and authority of Great-Britain to tax her colonies, and altho' they are already vir|tually repre&s;ented in the hou&s;e of commons, and as part of the whole with the whole in the &s;upreme
<PB N="36" REF="010116_0035_0F7CE94274AF7128">
legi&s;lative of the whole, yet as the American do|minions are &s;uch a va&s;t portion of territory, and contain &s;o many good and loyal &s;ubjects, it is or may not be expedient and for the public utility to indulge them with the election and return of a few members. But this being a matter not of right but of favor, if de&s;ired, mu&s;t be humbly a&s;ked as &s;uch. For tho' as Lord Coke &s;ays, the return of members in Eng|land is a matter of right in, and not of grace to, the privileged boroughs, &amp;c. yet the ca&s;e of the co|loni&s;ts is different. The&s;e never had a right to re|turn members. Therefore it mu&s;t be an indulgence when granted. The general a&s;&s;embly here tax and think they have a right to tax their out towns. Tho&s;e towns do and mu&s;t think them&s;elves rightly taxed, when they have all other privileges but that of returning a member. Whether and when they &s;hall receive this priviledge depends on the determination of the a&s;&s;embly. And when once granted it becomes a right, and they are ever after entitled to a writ <HI>ex debito ju&s;titiae.</HI> The ca&s;e is ju&s;t the &s;ame between Great-Britain and her colonies. The parliament of Great-Britain has a right to tax London. London has a right to return members. The&s;e are di&s;tinct independent rights. Some great towns there return no members, yet are taxed. The&s;e when it &s;hall be tho't proper, will be actually repre&s;ented; and when the admini&s;tration thinks it rea&s;onable, it can permit an actual repre|&s;entation of the colonies. There can be no de|cree without a judge, who that is we have &s;een. The parliament will ever con&s;ult the good of the whole. To make my meaning clear to the meane&s;t capacity; the juri&s;diction and authority of a court is one thing, the manner of exerci&s;ing that juri&s;diction is another.
<PB N="37" REF="010116_0036_0F7CE94555809BB0">
This matter &s;hall be exemplified from the court of a ju&s;tice of the peace, to the high court of parliament. A ju&s;tice has a legal, ju&s;t and equitable authority, to try a cau&s;e of 40<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. He tries the cau&s;e, gives judg|ment erroneou&s;ly. His judgment is yet a ju&s;t judgment and an equitable judgment, if his error was thro' a blamele&s;s ignorance of law, or of &s;ome fact, one of which is to be pre&s;umed. Here are three things, 1. A right to hold courts, or of juri&s;diction. 2. This right of juri&s;diction actually and hone&s;tly exerci&s;ed. 3. A right of appeal in the party again&s;t whom an errone|ous judgment is given. This will hold in the higher executive courts, 'till we come to the dernier re&s;ort of the common law, the hou&s;e of Lords. Even the chan|cery of Great-Britain is but a kind of appeal from &s;trict law, to more free, generous and equal princi|ples of ju&s;tice, rea&s;on and good con&s;cience. There is &s;omething &s;imilar with regard to the parliament. Government knows of no appeal from their deci&s;i|ons, it is true, they being as to the &s;ubject next in power and authority to God. Their juri&s;diction, power and authority, thro' the whole &s;tate and its dependencies, is uncontroulable. They exerci&s;e it on &s;uch objects as they think fit. All that can be done is a meek and patient acquie&s;cence in their deter|minations, with a humble hope that as all humane deci&s;ions and determinations depend ultimately upon a knowledge of facts and circum&s;tances, when new light from thence appears, that the &s;upreme legi&s;la|tive, ever watchful and vigilant for the good of the whole, will appeal of it&s;elf to its own further expe|rience and information, and alter &s;uch former laws as they &s;hall think fit.

<P>The Editor boa&s;ts of his "freedom from a da&s;|tardly, temporizing &s;pirit that dares not &s;peak out what every body knows to be true." One would think there was no great heroi&s;m in telling all the world what they knew before. The Editor has quite mi&s;taken his talent again, it certainly lies in &s;peaking out boldly in many in&s;tances what neither he or any body el&s;e knows or believes to be true. I don't &s;ay this is the ca&s;e in the revival of the trite ob&s;ervations upon the illicit trade between the colo|nies and Holland, and other parts of Europe. He &s;ays this is a "va&s;t prejudice to Great-Britain and her manufactures," and he might have added, of in|finite damage and hurt to the colonies them&s;elves. Not only the intere&s;ts of the fair trader, but the character, the lives and health of the whole continent have eventually been &s;acrificed, or &s;ubjected to great danger, for the emolument of a few contraband tra|ders in this way, and their patrons in each province. Many in a province have never been able to thrive, it would &s;oon &s;poil the bu&s;ine&s;s. But why does not the Editor &s;peak out, and tell all he knows of this trade? I defy his noble courage to do it. A word or two from &s;o important a per&s;onage, might be very &s;ea&s;onable. Why does he not tell the mini&s;try of the only po&s;&s;ible method to &s;top &s;muggling from Europe, and that without any &s;everity? Let him give not only the out-lines, but the whole of a bill for this purpo&s;e on the back of a card, that would execute it&s;elf, and render it as impo&s;&s;ible for him and his friends to trade from any part of Europe but Great-Britain, to

advantage, as from the moon. If he knows not how to effect this, which e'er long mu&s;t be effected, let him learn a mode&s;t &s;ilence. The Editor has confe&s;&s;ed, that money is nearly if not altogether his <HI>&s;ummum bonum.</HI> He &s;ays he is not "&s;o ignorant of the world as not to know that money is almo&s;t become the &s;upreme good; and the obligations of con&s;cience and duty, are but feeble re&s;traints, when pro&s;pects of great gain pre&s;ent them&s;elves! <HI>This is true every where.</HI>" He then gravely proceeds to prove it is true of every <HI>one.</HI> After this, the reader may if he can, doubt whether God or mammon is the mo&s;t de&s;irable object of, and mo&s;t &s;erved by this hero.</P>
<P>The Editor's contemptable flirt at a Pro&s;odian, and his <HI>auceps &s;yllabarum,</HI> reminds me of what I have &s;een in a MS. the antiquity of which indeed does not pretend to vie with the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ndelian marbles, but I will venture to affirm it is of as good authority as half tho&s;e that furni&s;hed Martynus Scriblerus, the fir&s;t, or Dr. Bently the &s;econd, with their <HI>variae lectiones.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See letter, p. 2.</NOTE> In this MS codiel. <HI>&s;yllabarum</HI> is read <HI>fa|bularum,</HI> which I take to be the truth, and agreeable to the emendation &s;ugge&s;ted, have re&s;tored the text. And 'tis &s;ubmitted to the impartial public, whether 'tis not now compleat. The whole pa&s;&s;age is &s;o perfect a de&s;cription of &s;ome lawyers, not only in Cicero's time but at this day, that I have ventured to prefix the whole pa&s;&s;age to the&s;e remarks, where if they properly belong, in the name of truth let them remain, I de&s;ire the reader not to transfer them. If any have a better claim to them than I and their <HI>in|delible indefea&s;ible</HI> known claim, can in a court of equity be &s;upported, let them go, I am not over fond of them.

"And &s;o my Lord Editor, you think a learned lawyer is in him&s;elf nothing, unle&s;s to compleat and give the la&s;t poli&s;h to his edu|cation, and fit him for practice and accumulation, he is properly taught to become all things to all men and women too.
