<OPENER><SALUTE>To Sir GEORGE SAVILLE, Baronet,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not only as the brighte&s;t ornament to the following e&s;&s;ays, in the cau&s;e of indepen|dence, that the writer u&s;es the liberty of prefixing to them your name, but being of opin|ion, that your actions will al&s;o be&s;t illu&s;trate the principles he wi&s;hes to inculcate, he hopes to de|rive from it all the advantages of a well-&s;elected motto. Feeling only for the public, you will &s;uffer even your own merits to be made the theme of prai&s;e, &s;o long as the public intere&s;ts &s;hall be thereby promoted. It is thus that your exam|ple will have its due effect; it is thus that your patrioti&s;m will be reflected from a thou&s;and mir|rors; and that, in&s;tead of exerting a &s;ingle voice in the &s;enate, you will harangue from a thou&s;and ro&s;trums at once; inciting in all the nations, to whom are known the Engli&s;h laws and language, a love of virtue, and a re&s;olution to be free. It is this appeal to di&s;tingui&s;hed worth in real life, that gives the &s;ure&s;t efficacy to the precepts of the morali&s;t; it is this which induces the lips of the orator with the powers of per&s;ua&s;ion, and is the kindling incentive to a virtuous emulation. How glorious the privileges of patriotic virtue! Not limited by the &s;canty mea&s;ure of per&s;onal labours, not confined to one age or empire, they extend to unborn times and nations, and the
<PB N="vi" REF="014673_0004_0F948C5CC80EF148">
patriot is the common ble&s;&s;ing of human kind. As an Ari&s;tides, a Brutus, or a Cato, hath oft given birth to Briti&s;h patrioti&s;m; &s;o &s;hall Bri|tons, in &s;ome di&s;tant period, and future Ameri|cans, catch the &s;ame generous flame from the great example of the Saville of the&s;e days.</P>
<P>Such indeed is the pre&s;ent low e&s;tate of public &s;pirit among&s;t us, that a man hath need of &s;ome fortitude, who, among&s;t the generality, would &s;o much as contend for the reality of its exi&s;tence. Nay, it hath not been di&s;carded by the bulk of the gro&s;s-minded vulgar only, but our very phi|lophers too, &s;o deep is the taint, have told us, that wi&s;dom is not the portion of that man, who can &s;acrifice his time and his peace, by taking an active part in public affairs; and yet, notwith|&s;tanding the doctrines of the&s;e epicurean &s;ages, and as little regarding the united ridicule of the thou&s;ands, and the ten thou&s;ands of their impli|cit di&s;ciples, I am not a&s;hamed to acknowledge my&s;elf one of tho&s;e weak mortals, who can be|lieve, that the ea&s;e and luxury of life are con|temptible in the eyes of a good man, when his country demands his labours, his coun&s;el, or his &s;word. Being of of opinion then, that patrioti&s;m is a real, an exalted virtue, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily think, that to decline its duties, is a meanne&s;s un|worthy the manly character, and that its wilful violation, is the mo&s;t atrocious of crimes. I be|lieve too, that this virtue burns with no &s;mall ardour in many a Briti&s;h bo&s;om; nay, I am cre|dulous enough to think, that be&s;ides the in&s;tance I have particularly &s;ingled out, it is to be found
<PB N="vii" REF="014673_0005_0F948C5E18FC29F8">
even in the Hou&s;e of Commons: there, I con|fe&s;s, its growth is not very abundant; for, it is not of a nature to thrive in the &s;ame &s;oil, which the occa&s;ional occupier mu&s;t needs &s;ow with the noxious &s;eeds of pro&s;titution and bribery ere he can &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Happy, could we &s;ay of this &s;eed, that <Q>it is &s;own in corruption, it is rai&s;ed in incorruption; it is &s;own in di&s;honour, it is rai&s;ed in glory:</Q> but we are a&s;&s;ured, by unerring wi&s;dom, that <Q>men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thi&s;tles;</Q> and our own experience hath invariably taught us, that in the Hou&s;e of Commons, <Q>a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit</Q> alone. And until there &s;hall be opened clean doors into that Hou&s;e, by which the members may enter undefiled, by the ba&s;e arts practi&s;ed in elections, mu&s;t we not know, that the real patriot, he who is incapable of de|bauching or invading the rights of his fellow-citizens, is to be looked for without tho&s;e walls, and not within them? And except the&s;e unpol|luted doors &s;hall be opened without much farther delay, will not that Hou&s;e, already the &s;ink of corruption, inevitably become the putrid grave of the con&s;titution?&mdash;though not, I tru&s;t, its annihilation. How &s;evere, or how la&s;ting might be this convul&s;ion, this di&s;&s;olution of the &s;tate, it is difficult to imagine, but that, as heretofore, it would only peri&s;h for a &s;ea&s;on, like a grain of &s;eed-corn, and, like that, be re&s;tored again, with a reduplication of the principles of life and vigour; I am happy in having an a&s;&s;ured confi|dence.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="014673_0006_0F948C5E8993FB08">
Since I am now addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to the pub|lic, Sir George, no le&s;s than to your&s;elf, it is fit I &s;hould remind them, that your parliamentary integrity, is only a natural con&s;equence of tho&s;e means by which you became a member. In one, as in the other, neither corrupting nor cor|rupted, you &s;tand a noble exception to a general rule; in which, we clearly &s;ee, how valuable would be an independent, an upright parliament. Let but the whole of the repre&s;entative body be elected by the unbribed, and unbia&s;&s;ed &s;uffrages of the freeholders, and we &s;hould once more be|hold the Hou&s;e of Commons an a&s;&s;embly of pa|triots, the terror, not the tool of bad mini&s;ters; the bulwark, not the abu&s;ers of the people.</P>
<P>Perhaps too, the public may be more indebted to you than they &s;eem to con&s;ider, for having, by an uniform conduct, through a &s;eries of years, effectually overturned the darling, but infamous maxim of modern politicians that <HI>every man hath his price,</HI> a &s;entiment which could only ari&s;e in the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t degenerate heart. Notwith|&s;tanding the contrary is a truth, far better e&s;ta|bli&s;hed than any the mo&s;t notorious hi&s;torical fact whatever, all hi&s;tory being enriched with numer|ous in&s;tances of it; and that it might be corro|borated in the humble and unrecorded &s;cenes of private life, by every man, who&s;e friends are &s;e|lected from the wi&s;e and good; and notwith|&s;tanding every human heart ought to revolt at &s;o &s;hocking a propo&s;ition, yet, it is certain, &s;uch is the prevalence of any opinion, how ridiculous &s;o|ever, which falls in with our &s;ordid devotion to
<PB N="ix" REF="014673_0007_0F948C5F3707EBD0">
avarice, that ma&s;ter-vice of the times! that we continually find this degrading maxim in the mouths, even of tho&s;e who&s;e characters in the world are yet re&s;pectable. This &s;trange lan|guage is very often to be imputed to a weak in|tellect, or extreme ignorance, and very often to an ab&s;ence of thought, or that wretched &s;upine|ne&s;s of &s;oul, which, for the &s;ake of ea&s;e, always adopts the mode of thinking and &s;peaking which is mo&s;t in fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>But when men of under&s;tanding, of reflec|tion, and learning, become the controver&s;ial champions of this tenet; when they enter the li&s;ts in form, make a di&s;play of their armour, and their arms, and boldly challenge all oppo|nents, what are we to think? Little do they &s;eem to reflect, that they have no way of com|ing off with honour, but by retiring from the field, and wholly abandoning a bad cau&s;e; for &s;o long as they maintain it, do they not, in the very act, proclaim them&s;elves villains in grain, or at be&s;t, only negatively hone&s;t, for want of tempta|tion to be otherwi&s;e, and tacitly acknowledge, it would be a madne&s;s in you to intru&s;t them with any &s;ecret or depo&s;it, by means of which they could advance their fortune, without hazard from your re&s;entment or a gibbet?</P>
<P>The&s;e unhappy men, do not only forfeit by this conduct, all title to tru&s;t and confidence in &s;ociety, but what is &s;till wor&s;e, they expre&s;sly exclude them&s;elves from the benefits of religion, &s;aying, in effect, that our Saviour's mi&s;&s;ion, for the purpo&s;es of teaching morality, and be&s;towing
<PB N="x" REF="014673_0008_0F948C60039622F8">
&s;alvation on mankind, &s;o far from being an in|&s;tance of divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, was exe|cuted like the vague &s;chemes of purblind mortals, to no manner of purpo&s;e; for, &s;o long as it is their a&s;&s;ertion, that every man hath his price; &s;o long do they a&s;&s;ert, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to obey the laws of Chri&s;t even in a tolerable degree; and to deny, that chri&s;tianity is capable of in&s;piring her followers with an incorruptible integrity, is not only to betray a total ignorance of its doctrines, but to make war upon fact, and the common con&s;ent of mankind. Thus is this hackneyed pro|po&s;ition, examined either by the rules of rea&s;on or religion, evidently involved in palpable ab&s;ur|dity, and in rank impiety.</P>
<P>For the mo&s;t part, they who propagate this wretched opinion, know not what they do; and would be exceedingly &s;hocked, did they perceive, how they were at once &s;ubverting their own mo|ral principles, and &s;apping the very foundations of all integrity in &s;ociety both public and private. So dangerous, is it, unthinkingly, to &s;wim with the &s;tream of popular opinion! e&s;pecially &s;ince it is become the great ma&s;ter-&s;troke of the arch-enemies of religion and virtue, to turn the cour&s;e of this current in their favour, and to make it the vehicle of that poi&s;on they are for ever pour|ing in at the fountain head, in order to taint a thoughtle&s;s world, They u&s;e all the arts of a &s;ubtile and ingenious addre&s;s, to withdraw our attention and re&s;pect from authors of &s;terling me|rit, and to in&s;inuate them&s;elves upon us as our only infallible guides. Under the ma&s;k of
<PB N="xi" REF="014673_0009_0F948C60F83CF130">
candour, they are mo&s;t deci&s;ive and dogmatical, infecting with arrogance tho&s;e ductile minds, which before were adorned with humility.</P>
<P>In a &s;tile of Attic elegance, they inculcate a frivolous and vitiated ta&s;te; teachers of intellec|tual ab&s;traction and refinement, they promote &s;en&s;uality; with an o&s;tentation of humanity, they loo&s;en the bands of &s;ociety; profe&s;&s;ors of morali|ty, they demon&s;trate that it hath no foundation; deep in all philo&s;ophy, they a&s;&s;ure us that truth is the only thing we ought to pur&s;ue; that it is mo&s;t difficult to attain, except with their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and when attained, they &s;hew us as clearly, that it is not worth our pains; and, like &s;uperior intelligences, &s;o very refined and &s;piritual, (as they would have you believe) as to look down upon human nature as upon a lower order of beings, and to contemplate, with an unmoved indiffer|ence and compo&s;ure, the blindne&s;s and preju|dices, the little pa&s;&s;ions and anxieties of a fretful and mi&s;erable world, they inform us that wi&s;|dom con&s;i&s;ts in this &s;ublime apathetic in&s;en&s;ibili|ty, while they, all the while are, in reality, &s;acrificing their own tranquillity, in carrying on perpetual ho&s;tilities again&s;t the invincible powers of truth, religion, and common &s;en&s;e, and yield|ing up the guidance of their re&s;tle&s;s and indefa|tigable pens to pride, &s;pleen, vanity, caprice, and &s;ordid avarice.</P>
<P>By pro&s;tituting to the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es a fla&s;hy wit and &s;pecious eloquence, they captivate the &s;hallow, the luxurious and the gay; while, for the reli&s;h of tho&s;e who have under&s;tandings
<PB N="xii" REF="014673_0010_0F948C6186D66590">
&s;ome-what &s;uperior, but more gloom and male|volence in their hearts, they &s;ea&s;on their pernici|ous compo&s;itions with a poignant irony and ridi|cule, which is u&s;ually heightened in proportion as the object is &s;acred or divine.</P>
<P>When referring to the Deity, and to the in|comprehen&s;ible things of heaven and eternity, one might expect, even of a philo&s;opher, &s;ome diffidence, &s;ome &s;obriety and decency; but this were too great a conde&s;cen&s;ion from the mad genius of Geneva, the &s;cribbling buffoon of Fer|ney, or that "fatte&s;t hog of Epicurus's &s;tye," the "&s;ee-&s;aw &s;ceptic from the remote&s;t North<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heroic Epi&s;tle to Sir W. Chambers.</NOTE>." With the&s;e "men of renown," as leaders of the van, and the Walpolian &s;tate-pro&s;titute to conduct the rear-guard; even the di&s;orderly, the coward clans of vice and &s;eduction, are an over-match for the feeble guards of virtue in mo&s;t fa&s;hi|onable minds.</P>
<P>By &s;trengthening the party of the di&s;&s;olute, and encouraging the unmanly, unprincipled, im|pious, and di&s;&s;ipated &s;pirit, which marks the character of the times, and by making a je&s;t of every thing &s;erious and noble; they in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the unguarded bo&s;oms of that cla&s;s of triflers, and become their oracles. The bu|&s;ine&s;s is now done, for the fa&s;hionable world is the mint, where common opinion fir&s;t obtains its &s;tamp and currency; circulating thence throughout the community like current coin, and, like that too, giving con&s;equence to its po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or
<PB N="xiii" REF="014673_0011_0F948C63DFC7D570">
in proportion to his &s;tore of this fictitious, this imaginary wealth.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that in almo&s;t every fa&s;hionable circle, from the peer to the 'prentice, from the profound writer of &s;tuff, called <HI>E&s;&s;ays on the Origin of Evil,</HI> to the novel reading mi&s;s in her teens, we are for ever pe&s;tered with tra&s;h, that is the bane of morality, and the di&s;grace of ra|tional beings. And while the polite praters vain|ly imagine they are di&s;playing their own talents and erudition, their knowledge and liberal way of thinking; they are only the mere ecchoes of tho&s;e teachers of fal&s;ehood; the &s;imple and obe|dient tools, by who&s;e agency tho&s;e cunning en|gineers are undermining all the defences of religion, of public &s;pirit, and of private virtue.</P>
<P>It is matter of no &s;mall a&s;toni&s;hment and con|cern, to ob&s;erve how much an indifference to moral rectitude, a habit of evading the toil of thinking and this pa&s;&s;ive re&s;ignation to the &s;entiments and principles of others, debilitate the human mind, though naturally active and vi|gorous, and &s;ubject it to the reproach of yield|ing to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t credulity, and even of a&s;&s;enting to manife&s;t contradictions. Nothing is more common, than for tho&s;e, who have the Walpo|lian maxim we have been &s;peaking of always at their tongue's end, to form to them&s;elves, I know not how, an ideal di&s;tinction between pub|lic integrity and private hone&s;ty. While they lay it down, as a fixed principle, that the &s;enator may be corrupted by a court bribe, to injure or oppre&s;s his country they will yet allow, that he
<PB N="xiv" REF="014673_0012_0F948C63FB626098">
is rigidly ju&s;t in all his private dealings; that he is the kinde&s;t landlord, the gentle&s;t ma&s;ter, the tendere&s;t relation, the true&s;t friend; &s;o very mo|derate in &s;elf-gratification, and of &s;o humane a nature, as to bound his expences very far within his income, and to di&s;tribute large &s;ums in &s;ecret charities, with a minute attention to the mea|&s;ures of di&s;tre&s;s among&s;t the objects of his benefi|cence. And, is it to be believed, that &s;uch a man&mdash;that a Saville is to be made a traitor?&mdash;Ye ecchoes of ab&s;urdity, think and blu&s;h!</P>
<P>But whatever hopes may be entertained of the ingenuous majority of mi&s;taken per&s;ons, I know there is yet a party, who&s;e incapacity for a gene|rous thought, or who&s;e malignity is &s;uch, that when, by the mention of his name as a &s;incere patriot, they have been &s;truck dumb with unelu|dible conviction, and obliged, in their own de&s;pite, to confe&s;s his virtue, have yet &s;ought to tarni&s;h its lu&s;tre, by ba&s;e in&s;inuations, to the pre|judice of his under&s;tanding. The&s;e in&s;idious creatures are not &s;paring of cold panegyrics on his general character; but, with much pity for the weakne&s;s of a well-meaning man, they la|ment that he &s;hould be &s;o deluded; they are amazed, for&s;ooth, that he can fancy he is &s;erv|ing the public, by oppo&s;ing and embarra&s;&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ary and wi&s;e mea&s;ures of government; they are &s;orry, that &s;uch a man &s;hould keep in countenance others, who only act the patriot, in order to obtain their own fooli&s;h ends; and they mu&s;t needs &s;ay, they think him &s;omewhat too much attentive to popular clamours and popular
<PB N="xv" REF="014673_0013_0F948C64D27989B8">
prai&s;e, and too much guided by a blind popular zeal.</P>
<P>But what they are mo&s;t anxious to inform you of, with &s;ome parade they affect to &s;uppre&s;s. In tenderne&s;s to him, they do not choo&s;e to &s;peak freely on that head&mdash;there is no nece&s;&s;ity to ex|plain them&s;elves&mdash;they are convinced he is ig|norant how much he is impo&s;ed on&mdash;but they take care, however, before they have done, by certain circumlocutions, by broken &s;entences, and unambiguous givings-out; to inform you, in pretty plain terms, that he is no better than the dupe of a dangerous party, a mere puppet, played off by the crafty leader of a faction, at|tached to his intere&s;t by flattery alone, and court|ed, not for his own intrin&s;ic importance, but merely to grace the cau&s;e with a name, upon which the &s;illy multitude have thought fit to be&s;tow an unmerited popularity. What a return for the labours of a life, devoted to the &s;ervice of that community, of which the&s;e wretches com|po&s;e a part! But no benefits can touch the vi|prous heart of ingratitude! Nor &s;hall malice and envy ever &s;leep, while a &s;park of virtue remains to ble&s;s mankind! Merit, however rai&s;ed to &s;uch an elevation, is a mark placed far above the idle efforts of their fever-&s;haken di&s;tempered nerves. Expo&s;ing their own hideous de&s;ormity, they ag|grandize by the contra&s;t, that virtue they mean to depreciate, and madden with &s;elf-inflicted tor|ment, their peculiar cur&s;e. The&s;e ingrates to their benefactor, &s;tupid as they are, ought to know, that though his character, like things
<PB N="xvi" REF="014673_0014_0F948C65870E1378">
mo&s;t &s;acred, may be profaned, yet that the broad aegis of wi&s;dom and virtue renders it invul|nerable.</P>
<P>Forgive me, Sir George, that I &s;ay the&s;e things in an addre&s;s to your&s;elf! As humility it&s;elf, in a private &s;tation, cannot decline to make tho&s;e hone&s;t boa&s;ts which be&s;peak its merit, when that is ba&s;ely traduced, or ungratefully forgotten; &s;o the public labourer, will not be offended, that his hone&s;t fame is held up to his country|men, for the purpo&s;es of exalting truth, and &s;ubduing fal&s;ehood, as an incitement to a &s;teady and high &s;pirited patrioti&s;m, and an encourage|ment to the timid in the public cau&s;e: while to tho&s;e foul harpies, who wallow in the filth of corruption, and batten at the ever-bleeding wounds of their country; and to tho&s;e minor mi&s;creants, doomed by their dulne&s;s, and their abject meanne&s;s, to remain the drudges of wicked|ne&s;s, without its wages; it &s;hall &s;erve as an ada|mantine mirror, before who&s;e brightne&s;s, if they have the power to open their fa&s;cinated eyes, they &s;hall then &s;hrink at the withering bla&s;t, like adders in a con&s;uming fire; praying, but pray|ing in vain, to lo&s;e the bitter con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own infamy,</P>
<P>I &s;hall likewi&s;e hope for your pardon, on this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e you under&s;tand the world well enough, to know the endle&s;s &s;hifts and eva&s;ions of the di&s;ingenuous and perver&s;e, who per&s;i&s;t, with unparalleled effrontery, to deny the mo&s;t undoubted truths, until they are borne down by the weight of demon&s;tration and the force of
<PB N="xvii" REF="014673_0015_0F948C66058EF558">
facts. They will deny, in turn, the exi&s;tence of every command in the decalogue; and you will di&s;pute with them in vain, until you open the bible, and reduce them to the nece&s;&s;i|ty, of either giving up their argument or their &s;en&s;es. So, when any one &s;hall undertake to re|ply to the&s;e maligners of mankind, if he content him&s;elf with proving ever &s;o clearly from nature, from rea&s;on, or religion, that a real patriot may be found, he had as well argue with the &s;tones under his feet, unle&s;s he produce the man, and put it upon his adver&s;aries to di&s;prove the fact.</P>
<P>If by tho&s;e, who are them&s;elves incapable of a generous &s;entiment, and cannot believe a di&s;|intere&s;ted affection can warm the human brea&s;t, I &s;hould be accu&s;ed of an unworthy de&s;ign to flatter you in this epi&s;tle; I &s;hall be ready to ac|knowledge the charge, whenever they prove that I have, in any particular, exceeded the truth or endeavoured to mi&s;lead you into a deviation from the paths of honour. And I would ob&s;erve, that he, who is the profe&s;&s;ed friend to every virtue, and the declared enemy of every vice, may in|deed, and ought to be applauded; and puts it out of the power of even a Decius (Shake&s;pear's Julius Cae&s;ar.) to flatter him&mdash;except to acts of goodne&s;s. Not having any favourite vice to be &s;oothed, he is only a&s;&s;ailable on the &s;ide of virtue; and the exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction, ari&s;ing from the ju&s;t prai&s;e of virtue, being one of the

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ame motives, which fir&s;t prompted me to publi&s;h the following letters &s;epa|rately, have, upon farther con&s;ideration, determined me to do it in a collective form. To the generality, it may not, perhaps, be a recom|mendation of them, when I a&s;&s;ure my readers, they wholly proceed from a &s;trong conviction of mind, and a zeal for the cau&s;e of liberty, and not from a view of &s;erving, or of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing any party or particular per&s;on what&s;oever, except the arguments they contain &s;hall make converts to my political creed concerning America; I fear they are not very likely to plea&s;e any party, for Britons of all parties and of almo&s;t all deno|minations, &s;eem far too unanimous in wi&s;hing to tyrannize over their brethren on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic.</P>
<P>Happy, mo&s;t happy, &s;hould the writer e&s;teem him&s;elf, could he entertain any flattering hopes, that his plain and humble pen might in&s;pire his countrymen with more generous &s;entiments! But are not his countrymen the brave &s;ons of freedom? lovers of ju&s;tice, and by nature gene|rous? He will then&mdash;he mu&s;t entertain the&s;e
<PB N="xx" REF="014673_0018_0F948C6874E09348">
plea&s;ing hopes. To know, that he had thus in|fluenced a &s;ingle individual, would afford him reflections, that would more than counter-balance the ordinary evils of life.</P>
<P>If, however, he had no other &s;atisfaction on this occa&s;ion, it would yet be &s;ufficient, that his American kindred &s;hould &s;ay, <Q>There was ONE Engli&s;hman an advocate for our freedom;</Q> but I tru&s;t there are, in the private and indepen|dent walks of life, many of the &s;ame &s;entiment; and that their numbers will daily increa&s;e, as a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the parliamentary preten&s;ions to the &s;overeignty of America, &s;hall more and more di&s;cover their total want of foundation; and, I am very far from de&s;pairing, that this truth &s;hall, ere long be acknowledged even by the mini&s;ter and the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>We may naturally expect, however, that they will be the la&s;t among&s;t the intelligent to receive this doctrine; for long and e&s;tabli&s;hed habits form, even in liberal minds, very inveterate pre|judices. Accu&s;tomed &s;o long to govern, and ha|bituated to the regular exerci&s;e of authority, they will find it very difficult to believe, that it ought to be lodged in any other hands; and they mu&s;t be above the common weakne&s;&s;es of our nature, could they part with it without an internal &s;truggle, &s;ince a love of power is, perhaps, the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">-rooted of all the human pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But, for the honor of human nature, and the glory of this free nation, I mu&s;t believe, that our
<PB N="xxi" REF="014673_0019_0F948C68F98115A8">
legi&s;lators will, in the end, gain this noble victory them&s;elves. Could I &s;uppo&s;e a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter of State to have a few lei&s;ure moments, from the drudgery of his office, and the wor&s;e drudgery of &s;opping the hungry hounds that are forever ready to devour him; from directing the endle&s;s &s;chemes and manoeuvres of the mini&s;terial cam|paign, and from &s;uperintending their operation.</P>
<P>Could I &s;uppo&s;e a mini&s;ter, I &s;ay, to have &s;o much lei&s;ure from all the&s;e avocations, for &s;eri|ou&s;ly contemplating the pre&s;ent alarming &s;ituati|on of his country, and for be&s;towing a little fore|thought upon what will probably be its &s;ate, in a very &s;hort period of time, unle&s;s &s;ome great re|formations take place; and, could I farther &s;up|po&s;e this mini&s;ter, turning his eyes within him|&s;elf, to meditate upon what it is from which he can hope to derive any real &s;atisfaction; to exa|mine thoroughly the cobwebs of all my&s;terious and arbitrary policy, and the rotten pillars of his &s;tate and power; and, when &s;ufficiently di&s;gu&s;t|ed with their loath&s;omene&s;s and folly, could I then imagine him to revolve in his mind, how plea&s;ant it would be to carry on the public bu&s;i|ne&s;s on a liberal and &s;imple plan, pure from cor|ruption, and uniformly friendly to freedom; I have not a doubt but he would mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h to embrace &s;uch a plan.</P>
<P>How gladly, if a man of &s;en&s;e, and a lover of integrity, would he exchange for it, his toils and perplexities, his provocations, his anxieties, and di&s;tracting cares; but above all, that con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="xxii" REF="014673_0020_0F948C69B8773B10">
of criminality, which no &s;tate-nece&s;&s;ity can effectually craze from the mind of a mini&s;ter, who, wanting the fortitude to for&s;ake the wretched &s;y&s;tem of the ba&s;e-minded Walpole, continues to work the wheels of government by the &s;treams of corruption, and who, by being involved in the labyrinths, unavoidable in all &s;y&s;|tems but the right one, and, in order to avoid the mo&s;t fatal of all imputations to a mini&s;ter, that of doing nothing, finds him&s;elf obliged to commit frequent violations on the mo&s;t &s;acred rights of his fellow-&s;ubjects, &s;o that he may get forward at any rate with the work of the day, and keep the people amu&s;ed, by letting them &s;ee he is doing &s;omething.</P>
<P>Until fair experiment &s;hall have convinced me of the contrary, I &s;hall never, I believe, think otherwi&s;e, than that the mo&s;t practicable &s;y&s;tem of government is, at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t &s;im|ple, upright, coercive and immoveable. Founded in freedom, and the common good of the people, it will cheri&s;h the &s;pirit of liberty as its vital prin|ciple; having no dangerous or &s;elfi&s;h de&s;igns, it will affect no my&s;tery: knowing the nece&s;&s;ity of virtue, and the advantages of integrity, it will di&s;|countenance vice, &s;uppre&s;s corruption of every kind, and be inflexible to ju&s;tice; and thus, by affording general protection, it will find unani|mous &s;upport.</P>
<P>But, it being our more immediate bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent, to confine our ideas of reformation to
<PB N="xxiii" REF="014673_0021_0F948C6BCBCEC420">
what regards the North-American colonies, which make, at this unhappy time, no &s;mall addi|tion to that burthen which galls the mini&s;terial &s;houlder. I have only to add, that I mu&s;t firm|ly hold my confidence, that our pre&s;ent mini&s;ter would, in the following letters, meet with the nece&s;&s;ary hints and rudiments, from which, with|out the &s;malle&s;t difficulty, he might plan the means for ea&s;ing him&s;elf of it; to the infinite advantage and glory of his country, to his own honor and &s;atisfaction, and to the inexpre&s;&s;ible happine&s;s of the whole people of America.</P>
<P>As I am certain, that no party principles will betray me, to have written from any other mo|tives than tho&s;e I profe&s;s; &s;o when I a&s;&s;ure the reader, that the &s;tile and manner in which I have done it are my very be&s;t, I hope he will be con|vinced, that I have not folly enough to a&s;pire at literary fame; and that his candour will over|look the very many imperfections of this little work.</P>

<P>EVEN the mo&s;t ignorant perceive this to be a cri&s;is of the utmo&s;t importance to Great-Britain, and to North America: but it doth not appear that the mo&s;t &s;age have yet formed a plan of proceedings that is likely to give content to both parties. With deference to the &s;enti|ments of others, and with a &s;incere de&s;ire of rendering a &s;ervice to my country, permit me to offer a few thoughts on the &s;ubject, and to throw &s;ome hints in your way, which I do not perceive to have been as yet &s;tarted by any political writer. It is mo&s;t deeply to be lamented, that pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice, pride and &s;elf-intere&s;t, have evidently too much influence over the minds of mo&s;t men, to &s;uffer them to decide impartially and equitably in &s;uch delicate conjunctures as the pre&s;ent. We want now to di&s;cover, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a princi|ple of la&s;ting union between our colonies and the mother country; while the mea&s;ures of admini|&s;tration, the deliberations in parliament, the &s;en|timents of political writers, and the language of the people at large, all tend to prove, that the mo&s;t probable event will be mutual jealou&s;y, ani|mo&s;ity, and &s;trife.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="014673_0024_0F948C71D504A168">
It is the misfortune of this country, &s;urely without nece&s;&s;ity, that &s;chemes of reformation, and plans of a great and comprehen&s;ive nature, for the general benefit of the people, are rarely or never formed before hand in the peaceful clo&s;et of a provident mini&s;ter; and, it is as unu&s;u|al for them to attain their completion by di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate contemplation, and the calm determi|nations of wi&s;dom. On the contrary, we &s;uffer every trivial error and irregularity to ripen into mi&s;chief before we think of reformation; when we undertake it at la&s;t with minds heated to fermentation, and we perform it with ra&s;hne&s;s and violence. Let not, however, on this great occa&s;ion, any thing &s;o intemperate and faulty mark your deliberations, nor leave a &s;tain upon your mea&s;ures. Reflect, that the fate of empires is now in &s;u&s;pence, and that the balance is in your hands. No patriots of any age or country ever had a nobler opportunity of immortalizing their &s;ame; nor, what is infinitely more to be de&s;ired, of obtaining the inward reward of &s;elf-approbation for having given happine&s;s to milli|ons. Remember your duty to mankind; re|member your duty to God. Let not the breath of anger or re&s;entment &s;ully your councils; let not jealou&s;y or ambition poi&s;on your brea&s;ts, nor hang upon your tongues. Be calm, contem|plative, candid, prudent, wi&s;e; let ju&s;tice and benevolence rule your hearts; in one word, be Chri&s;tians! embracing with love and charity your American brethren; and con&s;ulting their happi|ne&s;s equally with your own.</P>
<P>The two grand que&s;tions now to be decided are; 1. Whether or not the Briti&s;h parliament or
<PB N="27" REF="014673_0025_0F948C73E3E8AC38">
legi&s;lature, hath the right of &s;overeignty over North America? And, 2. Whether or not a Briti&s;h parliament hath a right to tax the North Ame|ricans (1)?</P>
<P>Although the latter que&s;tion be properly in|volved in the former (2), &s;ince taxation is a part of legi&s;lation, yet being extremely &s;imple and well under&s;tood, I &s;hall con&s;ider it fir&s;t, in order to get rid of it; &s;o as it may not embarra&s;s our di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the other, which it will be nece&s;|&s;ary for us to treat with all po&s;&s;ible per&s;picuity. As for tho&s;e who, with great warmth, maintain the right of parliament to tax the North Americans, &s;urely they are rather to be pitied than argued with! Mu&s;t they not be totally ignorant of the principles of that ine&s;timable con&s;titution, under which they have the happine&s;s to live? How then &s;hall we expect them to be acquainted with the principles of the law of nature, from whence they flow? When I meet a man inclined towards this opinion, I do not contradict him; and I be&s;eech him to avoid di&s;putation above all things. I beg of him al&s;o to dive&s;t him&s;elf totally of every previous inclination for &s;eeing the point in this or in that light; to con&s;ult immediately the great Mr. Locke, and other authors of note, and after a careful examination of the arguments for and again&s;t the que&s;tion, to decide upon it him&s;elf impartially and hone&s;tly. I remind him likewi&s;e, that it is his intere&s;t, as well as for the advantage of his country, that he &s;hould di&s;cover the truth: but a matter of total indifferency on which &s;ide it lies. If this fail to &s;et him right, I do not di&s;|pute with him my&s;elf, nor do I a&s;&s;ume the counte|nance or manner of an opponent; but I intimate
<PB N="28" REF="014673_0026_0F948C752099BFB8">
to him, that, were he of my opinion, it would afford him great &s;atisfaction of mind; &s;ince it gives me a con&s;i&s;tency of &s;entiment, by which I &s;ee every right of legi&s;lation perfectly con&s;onant with the freedom and the happine&s;s of mankind; and I then &s;imply &s;tate my rea&s;ons for holding it. I have ever found this appeal to a man's own heart and under&s;tanding, the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful way of en|lightening the one, and improving the other. Very few indeed of tho&s;e with whom I have thus rea&s;oned, on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject of American tax|ation, have gone away un&s;atisfied, or found a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of reading, in order to be convinced: but ignorance and ob&s;tinacy, heated by former de|bate, have &s;ometimes rendered my endeavours ineffectual; and &s;uch as were notorious for a vi|cious ambition, or &s;ervility to the ruling powers, have generally remained immoveable, though without producing one ju&s;t or wi&s;e argument in &s;upport of their &s;entiments, or rather their a&s;&s;erti|ons. Such men are not aware how much they lay open to the light that part of their characters they always mean to hide; and that there is as much di&s;hone&s;ty in that di&s;po&s;ition which denies an evident truth, as in that which gives a fal&s;e evidence, or takes a pur&s;e. It would have re|quired no learning, but only common &s;en&s;e and common hone&s;ty, to have known that a man hath no property, in that which another 'can <HI>by right</HI> take from him <HI>without his con&s;ent,</HI>' had not the world been pe&s;tered with writers of corrupt hearts, who, for wicked ends, have brought this clear propo&s;ition into di&s;pute, and involved it in a ca&s;ui&s;tical jargon, which per&s;ons of plain &s;en&s;e, and too bu&s;y or too indolent for reflection, are apt
<PB N="29" REF="014673_0027_0F948C75C5741A58">
to mi&s;take for learning and &s;uperior &s;kill; and to compliment it, fir&s;t with doubting, and then de|nying upon tru&s;t, what they once under&s;tood and believed. But I tru&s;t, that characters &s;o weak as the&s;e, &s;o profligate as tho&s;e, will have no in|fluence with the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature; that its deli|berations will be carried on with too much wi&s;|dom and too much dignity to give a hearing to the drivelings of &s;hallow and impudent praters; or to &s;uffer the un&s;eemly violence of &s;urious and tyrannical &s;pirits, to di&s;compo&s;e that &s;erenity and dive&s;tment from pa&s;&s;ion, which ought ever to be ob&s;erved in the pre&s;ence of his Maje&s;ty, and in the awful councils of the nation. Here I mu&s;t expre&s;s my concern, that it &s;hould &s;eem to be thought by very &s;en&s;ible men, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to appeal to ancient times, in order to a&s;certain the right of a free &s;ubject not to be taxed without his con&s;ent, either in per&s;on or by repre&s;entation. With as much rea&s;on might we go about to prove, that no ancient King had a right to take from every &s;ubject at his good plea&s;ure, an eye or an ear. It is &s;ufficient that we know any maxim in our law, to be at the &s;ame time a maxim of the law of nature, or demon&s;trably deducible from its fundamental principles. What is it to the pur|po&s;e, whether &s;uch a maxim was received and acquie&s;ced in only ye&s;terday, or a thou&s;and years ago? Truth is not the le&s;s truth, though man|kind were in ignorance of it until lately. No mathematician, in demon&s;trating an a&s;tronomi|cal problem, thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to prove the pro|perties of a triangle, a circle, or an ellip&s;is; why then &s;hould the politician wa&s;te his time and em|barra&s;s his argument, with proving principles and
<PB N="30" REF="014673_0028_0F948BC00DF60150">
axioms univer&s;ally a&s;&s;ented to by all ju&s;t rea&s;on|ers? not but that a maxim carries more weight and authority with it, as this of the nece&s;&s;ary con|nection between taxation and repre&s;entation, when we find it has been the uniform &s;entiment of all ages; and references to antient times, and to various hi&s;tories, &s;erve very properly to illu&s;|trate political arguments; &s;ometimes facilitating their reception among the timid and &s;u&s;picious, who are apt to &s;hrink at bold and hone&s;t truths, to which they have not been familiarized.</P>

<P N="1">(1) Let me recommend to the readers peru&s;al, an excellent pamphlet, under the title of Letters from a Farmer in Penn&s;yl|vania, to the inhabitants of the Briti&s;h Colonies. It is printed for Almon.</P>
<P N="2">(2) I think a noble Lord has lately a&s;&s;erted the contrary; but we &s;hall probably be of the &s;ame &s;entiment, when we come to an explanation of our words. I here mean that ju&s;t legi&s;lation only which is founded on liberty, and in which the people, either per&s;onally, or by their repre&s;entatives, have a &s;hare. Every other &s;pecies of legi&s;lation, being clearly an infringement on the inherent rights of mankind, is totally excluded from my ideas of government; &s;o that con&s;ining my&s;elf to a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> govern|ment, where the people have a &s;hare, it &s;till appears to me, that taxation is a part, and included in the general idea of legi&s;lation. If it be the &s;ole province and exclu&s;ive right of that branch, which con&s;i&s;ts of the people or their repe&s;entatives, to grant money for the &s;upport of government; yet taxation is not com|pleted, nor can it be carried into execution, until the other bran|ches of the con&s;titution have given their concurrence. A mere free gift of the Commons, without an act of legi&s;lation, would not be a <HI>tax;</HI> and we mu&s;t remember, that though it be wi&s;ely provided, that in all taxations, the Commons alone &s;hall <HI>give and grant,</HI> yet, that the Lords are not exempt from <HI>paying.</HI> May we not therefore &s;ay, with propriety, that taxation is a part of legi&s;lation.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March</HI> 22, 1774.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TO every man of candour, I apprehend it mu&s;t be evident, that 'Parliament hath not the rights of &s;overeignty over his Ma|je&s;ty's American &s;ubjects.' Every &s;pecies, in|deed of declamation and &s;ophi&s;try, have been made u&s;e of in order to &s;hew that it hath, becau&s;e it gratifies the pride of Engli&s;hmen in general, to think that, that legi&s;lature, in which they feel them&s;elves to have a &s;hare, &s;hould govern half the world: but there are not wanting an ho|ne&s;t few who think more ju&s;tly and more gene|rou&s;ly. Among&s;t this number, a writer who &s;ub|&s;cribes him&s;elf A. B. in the Public Adverti&s;er of the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d, de&s;erves the thanks of every friend to freedom. Except in his idea of the country of America, having been by the prerogative the property of the crown, which, in the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age, &s;ignifies the <HI>King exclu&s;ively,</HI> I en|tirely agree with him in &s;entiment. He hath clearly and elegantly refuted the notion of par|liamentary &s;overeignty; he has, with a generous warmth becoming an Engli&s;hman, appealed to the manly &s;en&s;e and to the virtue of his country|men (1). It would be an endle&s;s, as well as an u&s;ele&s;s work, to follow the many daily writers along all the mazes they wander through, in or|der to a&s;&s;ert the &s;overeignty of parliament, and to ju&s;tify admini&s;tration in the har&s;h mea&s;ures they are now carrying into execution. Notwith&s;tand|ing their laboured and fine-&s;pun performances, there is in reality no difficulty in the ca&s;e. We
<PB N="32" REF="014673_0030_0F948BC0F46669D8">
have no need of profound learning, nor an inti|mate acquaintance with antiquity, nor even of the hi&s;tory of the re&s;pective provinces and their different origins; neither do we want copies of grants, charters, or acts of parliament, in order to judge of the que&s;tion before us. If we com|prehend but the mo&s;t well known principles of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution; if we comprehend but a few of the plain maxims of the law of nature, and the cleare&s;t doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, all which are &s;o &s;imple and plain, as to be under|&s;tood by hundreds, nay thou&s;ands, of plain men who know not that they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o u&s;e|ful a trea&s;ure, we have knowledge enough on this occa&s;ion. The only requi&s;ite wanting be|yond this, is a heart &s;trictly devoted to truth and virtue, without which we &s;hall never under|&s;tand any doctrine that does not &s;oothe our pa&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel of civil as well as religious &s;alvation <Q>is hid from the wi&s;e and prudent, and revealed unto babes;</Q> that is, unto tho&s;e who are not puffed up with vanity and fal&s;e learning, nor blinded by pride, ambition, and &s;elf-intere&s;t, but who&s;e minds are in a &s;tate of humility and inno|cence. But we have our political Popes, who would fain have us di&s;tru&s;t our common &s;en&s;e and our feelings, and believe implicitly in their infallibility; nor do I doubt, but they would prove as faithful guardians of civil, as the Roman Pope is of religious, liberty, was it once put into their hands.</P>
<P>It is a capital error in the rea&s;onings of &s;everal writers on this &s;ubject, that they con&s;ider the li|berty of mankind in the &s;ame light as an e&s;tate
<PB N="33" REF="014673_0031_0F948BC1B0D51170">

Hence too we are told, that the&s;e men have a right to more, tho&s;e to le&s;s, and &s;ome to none at all. But a title to the liberty of mankind is not e&s;tabli&s;hed on &s;uch rotten foundations: 'tis not among mouldy parchments, nor in the cob|webs of a ca&s;ui&s;t's brain we are to look for it; it is the immediate, the univer&s;al gift of God, and the &s;eal of it is that free-will which he hath made the noble&s;t con&s;tituent of man's nature. It is not derived from any one, but original in every one; it is inherent and unalienable. The mo&s;t antient inheritance cannot &s;trengthen this right; the want of inheritance cannot impair it. The child of a &s;lave is as free-born, according to the law of nature, as he who could trace a free ance&s;|try up to the creation. Slavery in all its forms, in all its degrees, is an outrageous violation of the rights of mankind; an odious degradation of human nature. It is utterly impo&s;&s;ible that any human being can be without a title to liberty, except he him&s;elf hath forfeited it by crimes which make him dangerous to &s;ociety.</P>

<P>"The daily papers abound &s;o much in idle declamation again&s;t the northern colonies, that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;uch admirable rea&s;ons are ad|vanced in mo&s;t companies, where the conver&s;ation turns upon this important topic, why force &s;hould be u&s;ed to bring them to obedience.

The &s;ame motives, which induce their rulers to abridge their privileges, make the people of England willing to abridge the liberties of Ame|rica. The &s;ubjects of the King of Great-Britain con&s;ider them&s;elves as the &s;overeigns of his Ma|je&s;ty's American &s;ubjects; for, if the Hou&s;e of Commons have a legi&s;lative power over the colo|nies, the people of England mu&s;t have the &s;ame right ultimately, as the Hou&s;e derive all their power from the people by election. But it would be worth an enquiry how the people of England obtained this &s;overeignty. Was it by the free confe&s;&s;ions of the American provinces? By no means; or, did it re&s;ult from the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h laws or government upon the migration of oppre&s;&s;ed religioni&s;ts and their &s;ettlement in tho&s;e regions, which, by the prero|gative, were the property of the crown, (2) and which the King, by the &s;ame prerogative, had the power of alienating without the con&s;ent of the people of England, particularly when &s;uch alienation was made to a part of his own &s;ub|jects? It would be difficult to &s;hew that this was the ca&s;e, and I believe it has never been attempt|ed. That the King &s;hould have the &s;overeignty of the colonies is but rea&s;onable, is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h laws. If Engli&s;h &s;ubjects &s;ettle upon the lands of the crown out of this realm, with the King's permi&s;&s;ion and con&s;ent, they do not thereby become a &s;tate independent of the kingly power; as they were &s;ubjects in England, &s;o are they &s;ubjects in their new country;
<PB N="38" REF="014673_0036_0F948BCA12BCE7D0">
but they do not become &s;ubjects of &s;ubjects; de&s;|picable indeed would be their &s;ituation were &s;uch the ca&s;e. On the contrary, they have the &s;ame rights which they had before, and the &s;ame &s;o|vereign executive power. The rights of En|gli&s;hmen are not confined to this little &s;pot of land; but they follow the per&s;on as a &s;hadow follows the &s;ub&s;tance; however, it may vary its &s;ituation, whether it goes North, We&s;t, Ea&s;t, or South. The Hou&s;e of Commons can claim no power of impo&s;ing laws on the coloni&s;ts, for they derive no &s;uch power by election. The power of the Commons of Great Britain is circum|&s;cribed; from the &s;pirit of the laws, they have only a legi&s;lative power, and that power, bears relation to the purpo&s;e for which it was given; which was to impo&s;e laws upon the people of Great-Britain, but by no means the people of America, becau&s;e the power of the electors ex|tended only to them&s;elves. The three orders united, i. e. the parliament have a mo&s;t exten&s;ive power over the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, becau&s;e every power in the &s;tate meets in that body: but con&s;idered with re&s;pect to the Colonies, their preten&s;ion to &s;uch a power there cla&s;hes with the legi&s;latures of tho&s;e Colonies, they can never &s;ub&s;i&s;t together in the &s;ame place. As to the re|lation of parent and child, in which Great-Britain and the colonies are &s;aid to &s;tand by &s;ome ingeni|ous men, I confe&s;s it would be a tolerable good figure in a rhetorical flouri&s;h, or would &s;ound very prettily in metre; but with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,

when the rights of many opulent and populous provinces are in que&s;tion, &s;omething more than a &s;imile or allu&s;ion ought to decide it.

<P>AT the &s;ame Time that I hold that "Par|liament hath not the Rights of Sovereignty over his Maje&s;ty's American Subjects," and that "the&s;e rights re&s;ide in them&s;elves," I do not mean to promote an ungrateful for&s;aking of the mother country by her children, to &s;ever and e&s;trange the &s;ons from the fathers; but where filial duty and obedience cea&s;es, to &s;ub&s;titute in its &s;tead a brotherly affection, a manly and inde|pendent friend&s;hip, which naturally takes place where the parent hath truly loved and exerci&s;ed his authority for the &s;ole end of promoting the welfare of the child, without a view to &s;elf intere&s;t, or the gratification of pride, ambition, or other vicious pa&s;&s;ion. I would con&s;ider the American governments, like that of Ireland, as &s;i&s;ter kingdoms; and I would cement a la&s;ting union with them as between the &s;eparate branches of one great family. (1) We know that it is impo&s;&s;ible to effect &s;uch a family union, if the arrogance of the elder branch expect to govern the others, or even demand their homage; and how much more &s;o, if it demand the u&s;e of their pur&s;es at its own di&s;cretion, as a return for former a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or under pretence of maintain|ing the honor and intere&s;t of the whole combined family. But while every one is left independent,
<PB N="42" REF="014673_0040_0F948BCD0B9AC788">
and no other influence is made u&s;e of but that of &s;incere brotherly affection, a reciprocation of good offices, and a fair repre&s;entation of the general advantage of the whole, there is little doubt but that all will be ready to contribute their re&s;pective &s;hares, and that due re&s;pect and de|ference will ever be paid to the elder hou&s;e. Fa|mily pride, no le&s;s than tho&s;e advantages which re&s;ult from unions of &s;uch a nature, will produce this effect, except we be a&s;hamed of our family. I hope a &s;elfi&s;h and tyrannical &s;pirit in the Eng|li&s;h, will not make the Americans a&s;hamed of their de&s;cent: but illu&s;tration is mi&s;leading us a|gain into the tempting, but un&s;ure, path of ana|logy. Let us quit it once more before we lo&s;e fight of the direct road.</P>
<P>Every one of tho&s;e writers, who endeavour to &s;upport the preten&s;ions of parliament to the &s;ove|reignty of America by any &s;hew of ab&s;tract rea|&s;oning, have, &s;o far as they have fallen under my ob&s;ervation, either &s;at out upon defective premi&s;es, or from good ones, have drawn &s;al&s;e conclu|&s;ions; as needs mu&s;t be in this ca&s;e, until truth become a changeling. Plain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and an in|genuous mind, are &s;ufficient to guard any one a|gain&s;t their &s;ophi&s;try: but we have need of a lit|tle more penetration, and to be &s;omewhat con|ver&s;ant in affairs, when we would di&s;pute with a different &s;ort, who plunge headlong into the depths of politics, and hurry us unprepared into all the intricacies of commerce; placing at once before our eyes, in an indirect point of view, that

multiplicity of wheels within wheels, pulleys upon pulleys, and &s;prings upon &s;prings, which be|long to the complicated machines of government and trade, in&s;tead of directing our attention to the fir&s;t principles of motion, and the few ma&s;ter &s;prings on who&s;e movements all the re&s;t depend in a regular order and &s;ubordination. By the&s;e means they endeavour to confound, when they cannot convince us. But the&s;e are di&s;hone&s;t arts, the common tricks of de&s;igning men in every &s;phere. They are too &s;tale and hackneyed, however, to impo&s;e upon men of &s;ound and cul|tivated under&s;tandings. The&s;e know, that go|vernment and trade, as well as every &s;cience whatever, are e&s;tabli&s;hed on a very &s;mall number of &s;undamental principles of the utmo&s;t &s;impli|city, &s;ince they mu&s;t be &s;elf-evident, or they are no principles at all; and they know al&s;o, that tho&s;e who mean hone&s;tly, do always ultimately refer every maxim, by clear inferences, to &s;ome one or other of the&s;e &s;imple, &s;elf-evident princi|ples. All the &s;ubtleties and refinements, all the ar|guments that the wit of men can invent, will never be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify and &s;pecies of arbitrary do|minion, while we retain a knowledge of this &s;hort and &s;imple propo&s;ition&mdash;"the good of &s;o|ciety is the end of civil government." nor will they ever ju&s;tify a di&s;cretionary taxation by a prince or government, the people being unrepre|&s;ented, &s;o long as we know, that "a man hath no property in that which another can by right take from him without his con&s;ent."</P>

One of the mo&s;t &s;pecious arguments made u&s;e of in &s;upport of a &s;overeign power in parliament over the Americans, is that drawn from a &s;uppo&s;|ed nece&s;&s;ity of equipping a powerful armament at a &s;hort notice, for the protection of the <HI>whole em|pire,</HI> as the&s;e gentlemen will have it: hereupon we are a&s;ked, if his Maje&s;ty is to have impo&s;ed upon him the arduous ta&s;k of fir&s;t obtaining a ma|jority in two Hou&s;es of Commons in Europe, and about thirty provincial a&s;&s;emblies in America, be|fore he can rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies? and the interrogators &s;eem to plume them&s;elves much up|on the impo&s;&s;ibility of carrying on the executive part of government under &s;uch re&s;traints. Let me in return a&s;k how we draw &s;upplies from Ireland? Are they voted in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons? Then, in the fir&s;t place, I an&s;wer that if an empire be too large, and its parts too widely &s;eparated by immen&s;e oceans, or other im|pediments, to admit of being governed on the principles e&s;&s;entially belonging to all free govern|ments, it is an overgrown empire, and ought to be divided before it fall to pieces. The welfare and happine&s;s of mankind &s;upercede every other po&s;&s;i|ble claim or preten&s;ion to govern. When we find our&s;elves &s;ubject to a di&s;tant power, which cannot po&s;&s;ibly govern us on any other principles than tho&s;e of tyranny, we have an inherent right, by the law of nature, and it is an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to our&s;elves and to our po&s;terity, to &s;hake off &s;uch an unju&s;t yoke, and to erect a free government among&s;t our&s;elves.

<P>E&s;tabli&s;h the mode of governing which the&s;e per&s;ons contend for, and there will &s;till be the &s;ame inevitable delay, with regard to the Ameri|can &s;upplies, as they would have us believe is pe|culiar to the mode which the people there claim a right to exerci&s;e. For though a Briti&s;h Parlia|ment might <HI>vote</HI> them with their u&s;ual alacrity, yet we mu&s;t &s;end to America to <HI>collect</HI> them.

But the truth is, we &s;hould not defer the equipment of any nece&s;&s;ary arma|ment one moment on this account (2). Do we

at pre&s;ent wait for the a&s;&s;embling of Parliament, and a vote of &s;upplies, before we arm in any ju&s;t cau&s;e in which the &s;afety, the intere&s;t or honour of the &s;tate is concerned? Doth not the executive branch of government, by virtue of its own pow|ers and in di&s;charge of its duty, put the &s;tate in a po&s;ture of defence upon every alarm without lo&s;s of time, and then apply to parliament for its ap|probation and &s;upport? Is it ever with-held in a ju&s;t cau&s;e? hath the government no re&s;ources, no ways and means of its own, for di&s;charging or contracting for the future di&s;charge of, the&s;e prompt expences of the &s;tate? If the uncertainty of meeting with like &s;upport from America, as they find in Great-Britain, &s;hould be a clog upon our mini&s;ters in their warlike projects, might it not be fortunate for the people of both countries? Would it not make them extremely cautious and prudent how they involved us in continental poli|tics and in German wars? No ingenuous man will, however, entertain a &s;erious doubt of the readi|ne&s;s of the Americans to contribute their &s;hare to every nece&s;&s;ary expence of government, &s;o long as they &s;hall find them&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their freedom (3).</P>

Perhaps I may be a&s;ked, why do I, while the Americans are thus &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively inclined towards parliamentary &s;overeignty, officiou&s;ly endeavour to withdraw their re&s;pect and obedience; therefore, as a general an&s;wer on this head, let me &s;ay once for all, that it is the dictate of my con&s;cience; the &s;ame as it would be to warn any indivi|dual again&s;t ignorantly or heedle&s;sly acquie&s;cing in any &s;elfi&s;h, crafty, or unju&s;t preten&s;ions of another per&s;on, which, in its na|tural and unavoidable con&s;equences, mu&s;t end in his own di&s;tre&s;s, and the ruin of his children, and all this without even benefiting his oppre&s;&s;or; but, on the contrary, rendering him criminal and unhappy, and preparing the way for his ha&s;ty downfal. If an or|dinary regard to ju&s;tice, and the duties of humanity, would have required this at our hands, in a ca&s;e where only a few individuals were concerned, how much more is it the duty of a good citizen to &s;ound the alarm, when he &s;ees millions, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of millions thro' future ages, in danger of &s;inking into &s;lavery, with all it's attendant cur&s;es! and I moreover think it my duty, to &s;eize this occa&s;ion, of advancing my opinions again&s;t the &s;up|po&s;ed and pretended right of &s;overeignty in the Briti&s;h parliament over America, becau&s;e too many writers, through misjudgment, di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, or a ba&s;e pro&s;titution to the lu&s;t of tyrannic power, have taken advantage of this acquie&s;cence on the part of the coloni&s;ts, and of this principle with regard to the &s;overeignty being &s;o generally acknowledged, as a good political axiom; to deduce from it a right in parliament even to <HI>tax</HI> the colonies.

Could they, during every rece&s;s of Parliament, vi&s;it their re&s;pective counties, as the members can in Great-Britain?

Mu&s;t they re&s;ide a thou&s;and or fifteen hundred leagues from their e&s;tates and compting-hou&s;es, in order to &s;erve their country in parliament? Surely &s;o weak a &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment mu&s;t have been the vi&s;ionary &s;ugge&s;ti|on of a dream!

Do the obligations of friend&s;hip deprive the per&s;on obliged of his future freedom and inde|pendency? Doth not an attempt to en&s;lave, can|cel, in a moment, every former obligation? The&s;e declaimers &s;hould keep in mind, that voluntary good offices are moral and religious, not civil or political, obligations.

Every hone&s;t, un|prejudiced man, who will rea&s;on, and not wran|gle, mu&s;t acknowledge, that government's fir&s;t object was, as indeed it always ought to be, to extend the commerce of this kingdom. This was the end: the countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance giv|en to American &s;ettlers, was only the means, and therefore could be no more than a &s;econdary con|&s;ideration.

America, therefore, is not ungrateful; but is not rather Great-Britain unwi&s;e, ambitious, and tyrannical? The obligations, in fact, were mutual, and as equivalent as the nature of things would admit; &s;o that it would be a very nice, perhaps an impo&s;&s;ible, but certainly an u&s;ele&s;s &s;peculation, to decide which party hath been mo&s;t benefited. The attempt is in&s;idious, and he who makes it, is no friend either to America or Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Many definitions of government have been given us, and a multitude of arguments employ|ed, in order to &s;hew the well known nece&s;&s;ity of one central &s;upreme power being &s;omewhere lodged in every empire, which &s;hall be all &s;uf|ficient of it&s;elf to perform the whole of legi&s;la|tion, and con&s;equently taxation, as an e&s;&s;ential part of it. But this will make nothing for the claims of parliament to the &s;overeignty of Ame|rica. On the rever&s;e, it only points out more &s;trongly the error which mo&s;t people have fallen into in their notion of the Briti&s;h empire. They will have it, that the Briti&s;h empire comprehends within it all his Maje&s;ty's dominions in America; whereas the American governments, except that of Newfoundland, are independent nations, hav|ing within them&s;elves the rights and the actual powers of legi&s;lation, which cannot be taken from them, and lodged in the hands of Briti&s;h legi&s;la|tors, without a manife&s;t wrong, and the &s;ubvert|ing of &s;o many free governments. Here we &s;hall be told, that our Kings, in granting them
<PB N="54" REF="014673_0052_0F948BDB434FB7A0">
their original charters and privileges, only exer|ci&s;ed a prerogative which they derived from the con&s;titution; wherefore the Americans are &s;till dependent upon, and owe allegiance, not to the King alone, but to the &s;tate of Great-Britain. But &s;till I maintain, that the inherent rights of mankind, above all, their freedom, are not to de|pend on ca&s;ui&s;tical niceties and logical di&s;tincti|ons, (which, by the way, mu&s;t be fal&s;e, when they would di&s;prove the&s;e rights) but are theirs inde|pendently of all the Kings, all the governments in the univer&s;e. Kings and con&s;titutions of go|vernment are the creatures, not the creators, of the&s;e rights. They are held immediately of God him&s;elf, who gave them. Had the original charters to the American &s;ettlers been granted on the expre&s;s and &s;ole condition of acknowledging the &s;overeignty of parliament, even all that would not have bettered our pre&s;ent title one jot; for freedom, notwith&s;tanding all that &s;ophi&s;try may &s;ay to the contrary, cannot be alienated by any human creature; much le&s;s can he en&s;lave his po&s;terity; and, therefore, &s;uch a contract could only be binding, &s;o far and &s;o long as freedom &s;hould not be infringed by it; but, with regard to a virtue in it, of depriving a future people, many nations, of their freedom, it would be null and void in its own nature to all intents and pur|po&s;es; and 'tis a mockery to our common-&s;en&s;e, to plead it as an authority to this end.</P>

one and the &s;ame thing. Even the <HI>intention</HI> of the planters will not make it &s;o, where the rights of mankind, and the nature of things are not adapted to it; where growing colonies are &s;o &s;ituated and &s;o circum&s;tanced, that, in the nature of things, they cannot be governed by the parent &s;tate on the principles of ju&s;tice and freedom; it is &s;urely paying little re&s;pect to our under&s;tand|ings, and &s;hocks every feeling of a free mind, to a&s;&s;ert, that they mu&s;t neverthele&s;s &s;ubmit to its oppre&s;&s;ive rule, Having denied that America, when we drop the popular language, and &s;peak correctly, is a part of the Briti&s;h empire, it will naturally be expected I &s;hould &s;ay what are, and where are its limits, The Briti&s;h empire, then, I hold to be confined to the Briti&s;h I&s;les (I), and to the various <HI>&s;ettlements and factories of our trade</HI> in the different parts of the world, including <HI>the government of Newfoundland;</HI> together with the garri&s;ons of <HI>Gibralter</HI> and <HI>Minorea.</HI> As to the We&s;t india i&s;lands, they, as well as the continen|tal colonies, certainly have a right to their inde|pendency, whenever they &s;hall think proper to demand it, as they contain within them&s;elves every nece&s;&s;ary of legi&s;lation; but, if it be their choice, to acknowledge the &s;overeignty of the Briti&s;h Parliament, as I apprehend it may, be|cau&s;e, I believe, it will be their <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> I &s;ee no objection in that ca&s;e to its being exerci&s;ed.

in the Hands of Almighty God of bringing about, in his due time, that univer&s;ality of chri&s;tianity, that harmony and happine&s;s among the nations of the earth, which are intimated in the prophetic writings.

<P>We are told, that empire hath been ob&s;erved to make its progre&s;s we&s;tward; that every empire hath had its infancy, its youth, its vigour, its declen&s;ion, its death; and that they nece&s;&s;arily follow each other with the &s;ame certainty as in the frail life of man; and la&s;tly, we are re|minded, that Great-Britain hath pa&s;t her meridi|an, and empire is now ri&s;ing fa&s;t in America. To the fir&s;t, I an&s;wer, that empire mu&s;t needs have travelled we&s;tward from its &s;ource, except Europe had remained a de&s;art; that it al&s;o travell|ed Ea&s;t, South, and North, as well as We&s;t, witne&s;s China, Indo&s;tan, Aby&s;&s;inia, Ru&s;&s;ia; and that it hath already been in America, witne&s;s Peru and Mexico; and that it hath al&s;o taken retro|grade cour&s;es, witne&s;s Turky and the Per&s;ian em|pire under Nadir Shah; and with regard to mo|dern Europe, I can &s;ee no probability why it

To the &s;econd argument, I have only to &s;ay, that analogical rea&s;oning is always very fallacious, and that there is no analogy between things <HI>mortal</HI> and <HI>immortal.</HI> To the third, I mu&s;t repeat, that Great-Britain, having in her con&s;titution the principles of renovation and recovery, from cor|ruption and decay, and the &s;eeds of immortality (which no other &s;tate ever had) is in no great danger of a declen&s;ion, &s;o long as this World is likely to la&s;t; and that the Briti&s;h North American &s;tates having, all of them, chri&s;tianity void of per&s;ecution, as a light from Heaven; Briti&s;h freedom as a &s;oul, and a &s;pirit of com|merce as the breath of life; it mu&s;t be thought next to an impo&s;&s;ibility that any one of them &s;hould ever &s;wallow up all the re&s;t, and then ex|tend its conque&s;ts beyond the Atlantic and Paci|fic Oceans.

<P>WHEN we talk of a&s;&s;erting our &s;overeign|ty over the Americans, do we fore&s;ee to what fatal lengths it will carry us? Are not tho&s;e nations encrea&s;ing with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity? Mu&s;t they not, in the nature of things, cover in a few ages that immen&s;e continent like a &s;warm of bees? Do we vainly imagine, that we can then hold the reins of government, and hurl our thunders on the heads of the di&s;obedient? Where are we to &s;top? or, &s;hall we pretend to circum&s;cribe America populations? To &s;ay, 'thus far &s;hall ye go, and no farther?' No! Swollen in|deed mu&s;t we be with the pride of dominion, and drunk with the fumes, if we can fooli&s;hly ima|gine the&s;e things (1). It is high time that we opened our eyes to the unintentional encroach|ments we have been making upon the liberties of mankind, and to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting bounds to our dominion. Without the American conti|nent, the Briti&s;h empire will be large enough in all rea&s;on. But if government per&s;i&s;t in main|taining our &s;overeignty there, it may po&s;&s;ibly oc|ca&s;ion our own de&s;truction, but can be produc|tive of no good to us, either pre&s;ent, or future. After all that has been done to alarm the Ameri|cans for their rights as free men, and calling up their attention to a thorough inve&s;tigation of them; after the flame of oppo&s;ition hath been
<PB N="66" REF="014673_0064_0F948BEA2ECD4708">
kindled in every brea&s;t, and now annimates them as one man, it will be in vain to &s;teer any middle cour&s;e; to adopt mea&s;ures for <HI>light oppre&s;&s;ions,</HI> and compelling obedience to laws <HI>moderately tyranni|cal.</HI> We mu&s;t either relinqui&s;h at once our claim to &s;overeignty, or fix on their neck with &s;trong hand the galling yoke of &s;lavery. We mu&s;t either conquer our&s;elves or them. Ju&s;tice, wi&s;dom, humanity, and religion leave us without a doubt which to prefer; and, &s;hould the latter be determined on, woe be to Great-Britain! We may, indeed, by means of fleets and armies, main|tain a precarious tyranny over the Americans for a while; but the mo&s;t &s;hallow politicians mu&s;t fore&s;ee what this would end in (2). It would expo&s;e us to the certain attacks of all our Europe|an rivals; and, when we found the nece&s;&s;ity of courting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Americans, we &s;hould de&s;ervedly find them the bittere&s;t of our enemies. With the nations of Europe we con|tend for commerce, for glory, and &s;ome imagina|ry objects; with tho&s;e of America, the conte&s;t would be for the deare&s;t rights, the very dignity of humanity. After the &s;truggles of intere&s;t and prowe&s;s, a tolerable reconciliation may take place, but eternal enmity and hate always &s;ucceed tho&s;e between a free people and their tyrants. From the &s;pirit of freedom, which hath in all ages glow|ed in the bo&s;oms of true Engli&s;hmen, and which hath brought to its pre&s;ent perfection our glori|ous con&s;titution in defiance of every attempt to cru&s;h it; we ought to know, that until we can extingui&s;h this &s;pirit in the brea&s;ts of the Ameri|cans,
<PB N="67" REF="014673_0065_0F948BEDE9844BC0">
and eradicate from their very nature its fir&s;t and noble&s;t principles, &s;elf-pre&s;ervation and free-will, that all our efforts to bow them down in &s;ubjection to our authority mu&s;t finally be ineffectual, and will recoil &s;ooner or later perhaps with tenfold retribution upon our&s;elves. There are &s;ome politicians who think, that pre&s;ent expediency is a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification of any mea|&s;ures; and who, from the ideas of re-imbur&s;ing our&s;elves for the charges of the la&s;t war, of &s;up|plying the pre&s;ent exigencies of the &s;tate, and &s;e|curing our power over the American commerce, make no &s;cruple to bid us draw the accur&s;ed &s;word, and en&s;lave our children and our brethren. But, be it known to them, that though our very exi&s;tence as a nation, depended on violating the expre&s;s laws of God, it mu&s;t not be done. And if their ignorance, which may be implied from the folly of their propo&s;al, hath not yet made the di&s;covery, let them be told that policy, na|tional as well as individual, mu&s;t have ju&s;tice and the laws of God for its ba&s;is, or, 'tis the policy of villains, the policy of &s;ots and fools. Can the legi&s;lature of Great-Britain, I once more a&s;k, govern the Americans on the true principles of freedom? For the rea&s;ons I have already given, I believe it to be impo&s;&s;ible (3). As to their re|imbur&s;ing us the &s;ums of money &s;pent on their ac|count in the la&s;t war, they will do it, if we act wi&s;ely and ju&s;tly, in the only way it is po&s;&s;i|ble they &s;hould, and in the only way we expected of them when we undertook the war; that is, by a commerce beneficial to this kingdom. And by
<PB N="68" REF="014673_0066_0F948BEE1433E000">
leaving them to their own independency, the charges of government may be greatly retrenched.</P>
<P>Thus far had I written, when the political tracts of a reverend Dean fell into my hands. They amply &s;upply all the examples and expla|nations nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate my principles, and and &s;hew to a demon&s;tration the ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity, in a political light, of relinqui&s;hing our claims to the &s;overeignty of America; to which the whole tenour of my letters point, and with which they are to conclude. But I am far from &s;ub&s;cribing to this gentleman's doctrine as to the rights of &s;overeignty. If I could acknowledge the truth of that, I &s;hould very much doubt of the propriety of his propo&s;ed &s;eparation of Ame|rica from Great-Britain; for giving up one's right, cannot be thought a good rule for promoting his intere&s;t. But in this ca&s;e, as is very frequent, his common-&s;en&s;e hath been obliged to &s;ubdue his learning before he arrived at truth. While metaphy&s;ical refinements teach him to think, that Britain hath a right to govern America, the in|vincible force of truth extorts from him an ac|knowledgment that &s;he mu&s;t, if governed by true policy, relinqui&s;h it. 'Tis a pity &s;o able a writer had not di&s;covered that the Americans have a right to choo&s;e their own governors, and thence inforced the nece&s;&s;ity of his propo&s;ed &s;eparation as a religious duty, no le&s;s than a mea&s;ure of nati|onal policy. In &s;o doing, he would have been con&s;i&s;tent; there would then have been no ob|&s;curity nor would his &s;entiments of right and ex|pediency have been at variance; but his conclu|&s;ion
<PB N="69" REF="014673_0067_0F948BEF17800D60">
would naturally and evidently have flowed from his premi&s;es, &s;upported by that trite, but true and mo&s;t excellent maxim, that hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy. But, perhaps, &s;ome may be of opinion, that the propriety of a &s;eparation is more &s;trongly enforced, by its appearing to be the on|ly re&s;ult he could po&s;&s;ibly arrive at through the medium of opinions that pointed the direct contrary way, The &s;ame opinions have, in all other writers, led them only to con&s;ider, by what means the unity of the whole Briti&s;h empire (taking in America) might be be&s;t pre&s;erved; how the &s;upreme legi&s;lative power might be be&s;t &s;upported, and enforce obedience to the utmo&s;t bounds of this va&s;t dominion. Every project for this purpo&s;e (without a &s;ingle exception) being embarra&s;&s;ed with a &s;undamental incompatibility, a radical error in &s;uppo&s;&s;ing a right, where, in truth, there is none, hath been vi&s;ionary, oppre&s;|&s;ive, &s;anguinary, and totally impracticable; &s;o difficult it is to &s;trive again&s;t the &s;tream of nature and truth.</P>
<P>The Dean, with more good &s;en&s;e, with an ex|ten&s;ive in&s;ight into the human heart and the &s;prings of commerce, and with the temper of a philo&s;ophic, unintere&s;ted looker-on, hath nobly abandoned the full per&s;ua&s;ion of his own mind on the point of right; and, while he thinks we are entitled to govern, fore&s;ees and demon&s;trates the fatal con&s;equences of attempt|ing it. He accordingly advi&s;es us to &s;eparate in good humour, and tru&s;ts to our mutual intere&s;ts for its producing, in fact, a real and
<PB N="70" REF="014673_0068_0F948BEF740B2A78">
&s;incere union, and this, he &s;ays, is "the only means of living in peace and harmony with them."</P>
<P>In the whole cour&s;e of his work, wherever the di&s;pute of right is not immediately in view, his rea&s;onings flow &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and in &s;pite of him&s;elf, from the feelings of right in his own heart. In page 12, he &s;ays, <Q>For I am not for charging our colonies in particular with being &s;inners above others, becau&s;e, I believe, (and if I am wrong, let the hi&s;tories of all co|lonies, whether antient or modern, from the days of Thucydides down to the pre&s;ent time, confute me if it can; I &s;ay, 'till that is done, I believe) that it is the nature of them all to a&s;|pire after independence, and to &s;et up for them|&s;elves as &s;oon as ever they find that they are able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without being beholding to the mother-country. And if our Americans have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves &s;ooner on this head than others have done, or in a more direct and daring manner, this ought not to be imputed to any greater malignity, or ingratitude in them than in others, but to that bold, free con&s;titution, which is the prerogative and boa&s;t of us all. We our|&s;elves derive our origin from tho&s;e very Saxons who inhabited the lower parts of Germany, &amp;c. </Q>What can more fully prove the right of independence in colonies, too far removed to be governed on the principles of freedom by the mo|ther country, than this univer&s;al, this uniform, invariable feeling of all mankind, in all ages, than that <Q>it is the nature of them all to a&s;pire
<PB N="71" REF="014673_0069_0F948BF034F16FB0">
after it.</Q> Shall we reject the unvarying te&s;ti|mony of nature &s;peaking home to our hearts, and pin our faith upon the fine-&s;pun, cobweb &s;ubtle|ties of our learned ca&s;ui&s;ts and court-lawyers? or &s;hall we, with more &s;afety, rely upon the letter of an old mu&s;ty charter, penned before this que&s;|tion was &s;o much as thought of? Hath nature left her&s;elf &s;o much without a witne&s;s to the truth in the human brea&s;t, that we mu&s;t give our&s;elves wholly up to the direction of &s;uch blind guides as the&s;e? Fie! fie! If much learning hath not made us mad, it hath at lea&s;t in this, and many &s;imi|lar ca&s;es, made us ignorant. It is to be lamented, that &s;uch a blaze of truth, as there is in the above ob&s;ervation, did not di&s;cover to the writer the fal|laciou&s;ne&s;s of his original po&s;ition of parliamen|tary right to govern the colonies; when all the while, it is the expre&s;s, the &s;ole purport of this work to prove, that parliament in continuing to a&s;&s;ert this right, cannot promote either the wel|fare of Great-Britain or America.</P>

See the appeal above mention|ed, page 50.) and as an artful pretence for denying them leave of &s;ettlement, and that &s;hare in the peltry trade which they are mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for enjoying.

A chain of feeble forts in a wilderne&s;s, or the pronouncing this wilderne&s;s to be part of the province of Quebec, will form a mighty barrier truly, again&s;t the &s;warms that will one day pour we&s;tward, from the too populous &s;tates upon the &s;ea coa&s;t! I do not, however, deny, that even <HI>this</HI> mode of preventing anarchy, blood&s;hed, and cruelty for the pre&s;ent, is not better than none; but I think this is not the <HI>right</HI> way. To have con&s;ented, under our own guaranty, to a partition of this country among&s;t the bordering colonies, according to their re&s;pective &s;ituations, and as far as the ju&s;t claims of the Indians would admit, would have been at once an act of ju&s;tice and wi&s;e policy; or, if the enlarge|ment of the&s;e re&s;pective colonies would be impolitic, on account of the future balance of power of that continent, and the general arbitration of Great-Britain hereafter &s;poken of, then it might have been &s;tipulated with them, that their &s;everal emigrants into this de&s;ert country, &s;hould be independent of them, and left to form a new &s;tate or new &s;tates, under laws to be given them for a free government on their fir&s;t &s;ettlement, and &s;uitable limita|tions of country, for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving the future equilibrium and general peace. There cannot be a wor&s;e, or more narrow policy, than to give any check to American population; for, by tho&s;e means, Britain will lo&s;e &s;o many cu&s;tomers for her manufactures, and the colonies, by having their emigrations

I wi&s;h it may not be in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes&mdash;I wi&s;h it may not be very &s;oon.</P>
<P>(3) In framing the Quebec Act, it were much to have been de&s;ired, that none of the other Colonies had been &s;o much as thought of, it might then, perhaps, have breathed pure wi&s;|dom and benevolence; but, having interwoven in it that fatal po|licy. which is daily &s;owing the &s;eeds of di&s;cord between Great-Britain and America, I am inclined to think, it is ju&s;tly cen&s;ur|able in a high degree; and that it is far le&s;s beneficial to the Cana|dians than it ought to be, although it may be very true, that they are at pre&s;ent incapable of receiving all the rights and privileges, and the full liberty of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, yet that will be no ju&s;tifi|cation of us, for intailing on their po&s;terity &s;o much &s;ervitude to an arbitrary power, as by this act is ve&s;ted in the governor and council; all at the appointment of the crown <HI>during plea&s;ure.</HI> To have had an a&s;&s;embly, wherein the people &s;hould have been re|pre&s;ented, they had an undoubted right; to deny it them is ty|rannical, and a mere eva&s;ion, to in&s;inuate the impracticability of &s;uch a plan. Surely that power, which now totally deprives them of this e&s;&s;ential to freedom, had been exerted more agreeable to the principles of ju&s;tice and humanity; had it granted them but the rude&s;t model of an a&s;&s;embly, containing within it the &s;eeds of freedom, to have germinated and expanded with their pro&s;pe|rity, and their advancement in arts and knowledge! Tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the contrary, mu&s;t be little acquainted with the origin and ri&s;e of almo&s;t all the free &s;tates that have flouri&s;hed in the world, and mu&s;t conceive the Canadians to be more &s;tupid and barba|rous than the Hottentots or Samoiedes. As to any intention of our mini&s;ters to promote in this act the intere&s;ts of Popery, I think they may &s;tand freely acquitted of them; and though I am of opinion, the religious part of it might be amended, yet I can|not but &s;mile at the terrors that have been expre&s;&s;ed on this occa|&s;ion, as if his Holine&s;s was at the very door of St. Paul's. No; the error of the legi&s;lature hath been in not &s;eeing, that the mo&s;t perfect freedom in America, is not only compatible with, but is now become nece&s;&s;ary to, the pro&s;perity of Great-Britain; and its crime, if a crime hath been committed, in &s;eeking to &s;upport a tottering tyranny over the antient colonies, by erecting an arbi|trary government in Quebec. For the &s;ake of Britons on both

&s;ides of the Atlantic equally; for the &s;ake of the Canadians, and for the &s;ake of freedom's holy cau&s;e univer&s;ally, I &s;incerely hope a little reflection on an end &s;o abominable, and the &s;till more abomina|ble means, will di&s;po&s;e our legi&s;lators to retrieve, e're it be too late, &s;uch an uncon&s;titutional and alarming &s;tep. The act of parlia|ment of which we have been &s;peaking, as well as two other me|morable ones, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the writer fir&s;t began to publi&s;h the&s;e letters &s;eparately in a news-paper, are thought by &s;ober and re|flecting men, to be melancholy records of human pa&s;&s;ions and in|firmity; affording us mo&s;t &s;triking admonitions, that in national conduct, as well as in that of individuals, a mi&s;taken principle of action, if not for&s;aken, or one fal&s;e &s;tep, if unretrieved in time, may ea&s;ily hurry us on to lengths of folly and wickedne&s;s, at which we &s;hould once have &s;huddered with horror, but can after|wards per&s;i&s;t in to our utter de&s;truction, regardle&s;s of all the mi&s;e|ries we at the &s;ame time bring upon others. Will rational and moral beings never learn, that without ju&s;tice, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould ever be wi&s;dom in the councils of a nation? or can &s;tate&s;men believe it will obtain their acquittal at the la&s;t tribunal, to plead, that in their private capacity, "they did ju&s;tice and remembered mercy," though in their public &s;tations, they vio|lated the&s;e &s;acred regards; and through a fal&s;e notion of &s;erving and aggrandizing their country, they endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h ty|ranny, and to intail on millions and millions, the deadlie&s;t cur&s;e that can imbitter life? In what light mu&s;t a truly good and wi&s;e man behold a law, which is at once a yoke of bondage to one colony, and a &s;courge to the re&s;t! Although greater mi&s;eries, previou&s;ly endured, together with an ignorance in the value of, and the requi&s;ites to, freedom, may cau&s;e the poor Canadians, in their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, to receive it with joy and thank|fulne&s;s; will that ju&s;tify towards them, &s;o ungenerous, &s;o mean a policy?</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March</HI> 28, 1774.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE, my la&s;t letter was &s;ent to the Printer, I have a &s;econd time looked into the pub|lication therein referred to; and finding it likely to make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on its readers, as well as that there is the mo&s;t &s;triking incon&s;i&s;t|ency between its foundation and &s;uper&s;tructure&punc; I perceive that I cannot well pa&s;s it over without a regular though conci&s;e examination of its third and fourth tract. The&s;e alone being immediate|ly to the point, I &s;hall confine my ob&s;ervations to them, without taking notice of the re&s;t of the book.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the third tract, entitled, <Q>A Letter from a Merchant in London to his Nephew in America,</Q> I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve an appeal to <HI>the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution</HI> treated with ridicule, and an attempt made to &s;ub&s;titute in place of this only genuine authority, <HI>the letter of the &s;latutes,</HI> or even of Magna Charta it&s;elf; for the&s;e may all be imperfect, though as I have prov|ed in a former letter the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution cannot. A proceeding of this kind in an anony|mous writer, or one of no credit, would, I con|fe&s;s, have given me an alarm of danger, and a &s;u&s;|picion of &s;ome deep de&s;ign again&s;t the cau&s;e of truth: it certainly is very far from being a re|commendation of the pre&s;ent work. May we not a&s;k what is meant by removing the appeal from <HI>the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution,</HI> to &s;omething
<PB N="76" REF="014673_0074_0F948BF594FBCBB0">
which is called "the con&s;titution it&s;elf," (page 93 94) and what that &s;omething is&punc; It is not defined, nor can I under&s;tand what it is, unle&s;s it be a &s;omething which hath its &s;ole exi&s;tence in the varying and un&s;teady letter of the &s;tatute law, and therefore may be one thing to-day, and another to-morrow, as it was once tyranny and popery, and is at pre&s;ent freedom and true religion. If the author will be candid, he mu&s;t acknowledge&punc; that his di&s;tinction of "the con&s;titution it&s;elf," from the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, is unlogical, and a palpable contradiction. How can any thing be &s;et in contradi&s;tinction to its e&s;&s;ence? That <Q>Magna Charta is the great foundation of Eng|li&s;h liberties&punc; and the ba&s;is of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution,</Q> I mu&s;t po&s;itively deny. It is in|deed a glorious member of the &s;uper&s;tructure, but of it&s;elf would never have exi&s;ted, had not the con&s;titution already had a ba&s;is, and a firm one too. And as to this charter being the "foundation of Engli&s;h liberty," that was evidently otherwi&s;e; &s;ince it was an exertion of this very liberty that produced the charter; extorting it from an en|croaching King, as a meer formal declaration of rights, already known to be the con&s;titutional in|heritance of every Engli&s;hman. Be&s;ides I have el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved, that the original and only real foundations of liberty were, by the Almighty architect, laid together with the foundations of the world, when this right was ingrafted into the nature of man at his creation; and therefore it cannot be held, after the manner of an external property or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by charters and titles of
<PB N="77" REF="014673_0075_0F948BF79EA18998">
human fabrick. We ought to be careful to pre|&s;erve a go&s;pel purity in our civil as in our religi|ous con&s;titution; for they are both founded on the word of God. If the religious be more ex|pre&s;s and clear, the civil is more ancient, and no le&s;s divine, though only revealed to us by a ge|neral and fainter impre&s;s on the mind and heart of man. If the Dean will not admit the decrees of Popes and councils as of equal authority with the word of God, he will not &s;urely maintain, that a Magna Charta ought to come in competi|tion with the &s;pirit of a con&s;titution, who&s;e ba&s;is is <HI>internal ju&s;tice and inherent liberty;</HI> a Magna Charta, notoriou&s;ly known to have been extorted by the &s;word, and formed and ratified in the heat of a ho&s;tile contention. Nor will he, it is to be hoped, plead "the public &s;tatutes of the realm," (p. 4.) when they militate again&s;t the &s;pirit, or go&s;pel purity of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t remark, that his quotations of them, in order to prove the &s;overeignty of parliament, have not the weight of fair evidence in the trial now before the tribunal of the pub|lic; &s;ince they &s;tand in the place, and in the nature of parties concerned. It is the&s;e very "public &s;tatutes of the realm," arrogating a right to govern and to tax the Americans which are cal|led in que&s;tion; therefore their te&s;timony goes for nothing, If the cau&s;e be given in their fa|vour, then it will be time enough for them to operate; but if it goes again&s;t them, they mu&s;t all be condemned as u&s;urpations. We are now ar|guing what is ju&s;t and right, and <HI>ought to be</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="014673_0076_0F948BF7B9E98408">
practi&s;ed, not what <HI>has been</HI> practi&s;ed by tho&s;e who had the power in their hands; not what they have been plea&s;ed, in their declarations to <HI>call</HI> ju&s;t and and right. Although Parliament &s;hould enact, that rea&s;on and truth &s;hould no longer be rea&s;on and truth, yet plain and hone&s;t people would be apt to call them rea&s;on and truth &s;till, and to rely upon them with the &s;ame a&s;&s;urance they do at pre&s;ent. Hence it is, and ever will be, a truth as evident and as uncontrovertible as any law of nature can be, that "an American," not|with&s;tanding the ingenuity of this author, and all that has been, or can be &s;aid to the contrary, has a right to in&s;i&s;t, <Q>that according to the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, he ought not to be taxed without his own con&s;ent, given either by him&s;elf or by a repre&s;entative in parliament;</Q> I will not add "cho&s;en by him&s;elf;" becau&s;e that, with regard to each individual, were we di&s;po&s;ed to cavil, would lead us into u&s;ele&s;s and puerile di&s;putations, (p. 93.) Every man of &s;en&s;e admits of the pro|priety of virtual repre&s;entation, &s;o far as it an|&s;wers the ends and purpo&s;es of a real one, <HI>but no farther.</HI> I am &s;incerely &s;orry to ob&s;erve a writer, &s;o much entitled to re&s;pect as the Dean of Gloce&s;|ter, employ his talents in an endeavour to mi&s;lead us into an opinion, that the Americans are virtually repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parliament. It were a &s;uitable and an innocent exerci&s;e of parts in a young di&s;putant at college; but will it bear to be gravely debated upon by a political writer! Well might a noble Lord exclaim, <Q>for as to the di&s;tinction of a virtual repre&s;entation, it is &s;o
<PB N="79" REF="014673_0077_0F948BF887148FA0">
ab&s;urd, as not to de&s;erve an an&s;wer; I there|fore pa&s;s it over with contempt.</Q> And if au|thorities are to have their weight, that, I pre|&s;ume of this noble Lord, who pre&s;ided with &s;o much dignity and lu&s;tre, in the noble&s;t court of equity in the world, will be allowed to preponde|rate again&s;t the Dean's, at lea&s;t in the judgment of every one who reads the tracts before us. If our author had duly weighed the a guments he has quoted from Judge Fo&s;ter, in his 4th tract, (p. 27.) he would have found, that they made nothing for &s;uch a virtual repre&s;entation <HI>as he con|tends for.</HI> The Judge, it is plain, was not &s;o ir|rational as to think of the welfare of <HI>two &s;eparats nations</HI> (for &s;o we may &s;urely e&s;teem Britain and America, think as we will of <HI>empire</HI>) inhabiting, with re&s;pect one to the other, <Q>the ends of the earth,</Q> as being a fit object of con&s;ultation to a &s;ingle national a&s;&s;embly; and that the deputies of one of the&s;e nations could be e&s;teemed the re|pre&s;entatives of the other. As to the imagination of Great Britain and America being <HI>one empire,</HI> the&s;e are only words that &s;erve to blind, to amu&s;e, and to confound incon&s;iderate rea&s;oners.</P>
<P>How often mu&s;t it be repeated, that pride, ambition, and lu&s;t of dominion, are not, <HI>on any pretence what&s;oever,</HI> to be gratified at the expence of nations; and that the <HI>&s;ole end</HI> of civil govern|ment is to promote the good of the people? If an empire become too wide and unwieldy for this purpo&s;e, I do a&s;&s;ert, that by the laws of nature, which are the laws of God, <HI>it is no empire,</HI> that is to &s;ay, not a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> empire. It therefore mu&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="014673_0078_0F948BF9312281A8">
be divided, unle&s;s we admit that tyranny can be rightfully e&s;tabli&s;hed, which God forbid! In our own ca&s;e, I only want it to be done in form, as it is already done in fact, in which the Dean agrees with me; <Q>for &s;ays he, (p. 12) an un|doubted fact it is, that from the moment in which Canada came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, an end was put to the &s;overeignty of the mother-country over her colonies (1).</Q> I mu&s;t now take notice of one argument, in fa|vour of virtual repre&s;entation, that our author &s;eems to value him&s;elf upon, as of &s;ufficient force to decide the general di&s;pute with the Americans, and, at the &s;ame time, the much litigated que&s;|tion of the Middle&s;ex election.&mdash;We find it in a note, (p. 29) <Q>Surely the nation might have expelled Mr. Wilkes, or have &s;truck his name out of the li&s;t of committee, had it been a&s;&s;em|bled, and had it thought proper &s;o to do. What then &s;hould hinder the deputies of the nation from doing the &s;ame thing? and which ought to prevail in this ca&s;e, the nation in general, or the county of Middle&s;ex?</Q> Now, this argument is evidently fallacious; for the Hou&s;e of Commons doth <HI>not</HI> an&s;wer to the <HI>ima|gined committee</HI> of Judge Fo&s;tter, to which it is here compared; for that was a &s;imple <HI>democratical</HI> council. Our national committee con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Lords,</HI> as well as Commons? and therefore, according to the Dean's premi&s;es, that "the na|tion might have expelled Mr. Wilkes," it is the nece&s;&s;ary conclu&s;ion, that nothing le&s;s than the na|tional committee, namely, our compleat legi&s;la|ture
<PB N="81" REF="014673_0079_0F948BFA425749F8">
of King, Lords, and Commons, had a right to &s;trike his name out of the li&s;t. I entirely agree with this writer, that the member cho&s;en and re|turned by certain individuals, is the repre&s;entative of the whole nation; &s;o that what is generally called a virtual, is, in fact, a real repre&s;entation; but, at the &s;ame time, I mu&s;t &s;ay it doth not ap|pear to be very con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution,</HI> (if that expre&s;&s;ion will not give of|fence) that a Dunwich or an Old Sarum, contain|ing half a dozen cottagers, &s;hould have the chu|&s;ing of as many of the&s;e national repre&s;entatives as a Norwich or a Bri&s;tol; nor that a Weymouth &s;hould return as great a number as the metropolis, who&s;e citizens, according to our author, (p. 99) form <Q>a body as re&s;pectable as the greate&s;t of our colonies with regard to <HI>property,</HI> and &s;u|perior to many of them with re&s;pect to <HI>num|bers.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Is not this an abu&s;e that calls aloud for reform|tion? Can any thing be more notorious, than that a great majority of the national repre&s;entatives are elected by a &s;mall number of indigent and cor|rupt men, who profe&s;&s;edly make a trade of vo|ting, and who gratify, in the very act, a &s;ordid &s;elf-intere&s;t, in direct violation of the rights and intere&s;ts of the nation collectively. The&s;e electors being <HI>primarily</HI> the repre&s;entatives of the nation, may be called the <HI>elective repre&s;entatives;</HI> and are an&s;werable to the nation for the exerci&s;e of that great tru&s;t. If they pervert it from the end for which it was given them, and transfer it to bad men for their own &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, it is fit
<PB N="82" REF="014673_0080_0F948BFC8B63F078">
<HI>they &s;hould be deprived of it,</HI> in order to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hing a more ju&s;t and &s;afe mode of electing the <HI>legi&s;lative repre&s;entatives</HI> of the nation. But to return; I am of opinion, the Dean might as well have &s;pared his reproaches of "folly and ab&s;urdity" upon the po&s;itions of the Americans, concerning their want of an adequate repre&s;enta|tion, (p. 98) and have omitted his compari&s;on of the &s;tate of the city of London, although it <Q>hath long enjoyed, before the colonies were ever thought of, the three-fold power of juri&s;|diction, legi&s;lation, and taxation <HI>in certain ca&s;es;</HI> for, if no man in his &s;en&s;es ever yet &s;uppo&s;ed, that the city of London either was or could be exempted, by her charters, from parliamentary juri&s;diction, or parliamentary taxes;</Q> it is full as evident that no man in his &s;en&s;es can &s;ee any ju&s;t &s;imilitude, with re&s;pect to parliamentary juri&s;diction and taxation between <HI>a metropolis,</HI> the very central point of a nation, and <HI>an entire kindred nation,</HI> which hath ari&s;en in the new world, at the di&s;tance of three thou|&s;and miles from the parent &s;tate, and beyond the va&s;t Atlantic Ocean. <HI>It is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ecurity of the liberty and property of the citizens of London,</HI> to be &s;ubject to parliamentary juri&s;|diction and taxation! but this &s;ubjection <HI>would not be con&s;i&s;tent</HI> with the &s;ecurity of the American nations. May not a man in his &s;en&s;es believe, that a kindred nation, or a colony, if you plea&s;e, may be capable of managing its own concerns; and that it is full as likely to do it faithfully as the legi&s;lators of its mother country? May not a

Would the independency of any colony or kindred nation in America, nece&s;&s;arily create any &s;uch confu&s;ion, any &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tency in the government of Great-Britain, as would follow from the independency of, and a &s;eparate &s;upreme legi&s;lation in, the capital city?</P>

<P>WHEN our reverend author is not in a jeering humour, he will acknowledge that it is, in reality, <Q>unrea&s;onable, un|ju&s;t and cruel,</Q> to tax an unrepre&s;ented people (for I deny that America is repre&s;ented at We&s;tmin&s;ter) again&s;t their own con&s;ent. (P. 100.) But <Q>&s;trange, exclaims the Dean, that you did not di&s;cover the&s;e bad things before! Strange, that tho' the Briti&s;h parliament has been, from the beginning, thus <HI>unrea&s;onable,</HI> thus <HI>unju&s;t</HI> and <HI>cruel</HI> towards you, by levy|ing taxes on many commodities, outwards
<PB N="84" REF="014673_0082_0F948BFF09E0AFC0">
and inwards; nay, by laying an internal tax, the po&s;t-tax, for example, on the whole Briti&s;h empire in America; and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, by making laws to affect your property, your paper currency, and even to take away life it|&s;elf if you offended again&s;t them: &s;trange and unaccountable, I &s;ay, that after you had &s;uffered this &s;o long, you &s;hould not have been able to have di&s;covered that you were without repre&s;ent|atives in the Briti&s;h parliament, <HI>of your own electing,</HI> till this enlightening tax upon paper opened your eyes! And what a pity is it, that you have been &s;laves for &s;o many generations, and yet did not know that you were &s;laves until now.</Q> Now, &s;trange and unaccountable as this may appear to the Dean, it has been by means of the very &s;ame kind preci&s;ely that our eyes have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively opened to &s;ee the ju&s;t rights of the people, the due limits of authority in their rulers, in every particular in which they are now legally a&s;certained. A rude and infant nation of hu&s;bandmen, having no pre&s;&s;ing occa|&s;ion, is not very logical or critically learned in the law, and all its remote con&s;equences. It mu&s;t move progre&s;&s;ively towards the acqui&s;ition of knowledge as well as &s;trength. This know|ledge will always be fir&s;t confined to reflecting individuals, before it will &s;pread at large among&s;t the people; and many &s;uch individuals among&s;t the Americans, by the Dean's own account, (P. 4, and 5,) have had "their eyes open" the&s;e hundred years and upwards. The bulk of a nation mu&s;t be made to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">eel,</HI> before they rea&s;on with tolerable accuracy, or lay much &s;tre&s;s upon

their governors keeping &s;trictly within the pale of ju&s;t and legal authority. Even &s;elf-evident truths are not di&s;cerned, until the attention of mankind is called upon by nece&s;&s;ity, or &s;ome other powerful cau&s;e, to examine the &s;ubject in which they exi&s;t. The divine right of Kings, and their ab&s;olute power too, might have remain|ed in the creeds of all nations to this day, had not too liberal an exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers taught them to rea&s;on by making them <HI>feel.</HI> No man in any country, ever thought of &s;crupulou&s;ly defining the proper powers of taxation, while he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no|thing worth taxing; nor of limiting the exerci&s;e of &s;uch powers, &s;o long as the contributions re|quired were trifling to him, the occa&s;ions of rai&s;ing them apparent to all men, and the appli|cation of them known to, and approved by, every individual. It is, when a &s;tate begins to ri&s;e into &s;ome degree of political con&s;equence, and the operations of its government are become too &s;ecret and complex to be penetrated by the vulgar eye, and at the &s;ame time grow expen&s;ive to the peo|ple, that they, not knowing what is going for|ward, and &s;u&s;picious of &s;ome ill towards them|&s;elves, begin to inve&s;tigate the legal powers of taxing, and how far they ought to be exerci&s;ed; nor &s;hall we exceed the truth, if we add, that all their jealou&s;y and vigilance have been little enough, in the happie&s;t age and nation, for guard|ing again&s;t the king-craft and tyranny of their ru|lers. While too in&s;ignificant to become the objects, or the tools of ambition, they remain in ignorance; it is the alarm of chains, and the
<PB N="86" REF="014673_0084_0F948C0147C9A318">
di&s;like of burthens, that <Q>enlighten them and open their eyes.</Q> After what has been &s;aid, I &s;hould hope it was quite unnece&s;&s;ary to refute the feeble arguments we find in p. 101, 102, 103, drawn from the freedom which an American now is permitted to enjoy, of voting for a member of the Briti&s;h parliament. We mu&s;t remember, however, that he cannot do this without being a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> freeholder, or holding &s;ome property which makes him at lea&s;t a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;ubject; and it is therefore <HI>as a Briton,</HI> not <HI>as an American,</HI> he is repre&s;ented. But to trace this rope of &s;and any farther, would really be to mock my readers, and I have already &s;ufficiently replied to all &s;uch &s;orry &s;ubtleties. If the true and proper relation, in which this country &s;tands with regard to the colonies, hath not, in all particulars, been accu|rately defined by mutual agreement and declaratory laws; but there are to be found &s;ome little incon|&s;i&s;tencies, as there needs mu&s;t be in &s;uch a con|nection &s;o long as Great-Britain, through a love of rule, finds means to evade a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of <HI>the que&s;tion of right;</HI> which, I pray, is the cour&s;e that a wi&s;e and good man ought to pur&s;ue, in or|der to reconcile all contradictions, and to obtain a ju&s;t idea of what is fit to be done for the reme|dying the&s;e inconveniences? Ought not the wel|fare of the whole people, without any partiality for countries, to out-weigh, in his mind, every other con&s;ideration?

how antient, how &s;pecious &s;oever, that is evi|dently incompatible with this object? Surely he will not lo&s;e &s;ight of the true, the only ends of government, and labour to harden the heart and &s;trengthen the hands of tyranny! Nor will he, &s;urely, di&s;regard the plain and obvious dictates of rea&s;on and nature, and, in defence of a bad cau&s;e, &s;toop and &s;train to catch at every little flaw and defect in forms and precedents! But one fal&s;e &s;tep in rea&s;oning, frequently mi&s;leads a good man into opinions and di&s;putations prejudicial to truth. However, when the good of the public &s;hall ul|timately appear to be the end he aims at, we mu&s;t make charitable allowances for his mi&s;takes. Such allowances I am di&s;po&s;ed to make to the au|thor of the tract; but yet as a well-wi&s;her, and in perfect good humour, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay he has indulged too freely a &s;pirit, I will not &s;ay a talent, of ridicule; he is too &s;upercilious even to his ne|phew, and is apt to &s;neer &s;omewhat out of &s;ea&s;on, and when a &s;atirical opponent might very ea&s;ily retort it upon him with double force. Neither doth he appear to me quite &s;o cool, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and impartial, as becomes a man who takes upon him to elucidate a di&s;puted que&s;tion on which de|pends the welfare, perhaps the exi&s;tence of na|tions. He mu&s;t have been a poor ca&s;ui&s;t, indeed, not to have obtained a victory over an antagoni&s;t of his own making: but we need not quarrel with him for beating him, &s;ince he &s;hewed him &s;o much mercy and good manners.

into the mouth of a wrongheaded ignorant boy? Had it not been more to the advantage of his knowledge and eloquence, to have impre&s;&s;ed conviction upon the mind of an experienced and able man, one who was well acquainted with the hi&s;tory, the laws, and the con&s;titution of both Great-Britain and the colonies? But in that ca&s;e, decency would have confined him to argument, in&s;tead of &s;neer and ridicule, and to a carriage &s;uited to an equal, in&s;tead of that &s;uper|cilious &s;uperiority a&s;&s;umed over the booby ne|phew; and this would have deprived his letter of its principal force and &s;pirit. <Q>But let that pa&s;s,</Q> and let us proceed to what is more to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Our author proves, very &s;atisfactorily, that the cau&s;e of contention between us and the colonies, is no recent affair&mdash;not the factious contrivance of a Lord Chatham, or a Lord Cambden, as the hi&s;torians of the day would have it, but exi&s;ted in no &s;mall force &s;o early in the la&s;t century as 1670, (p, 5,) and in 1696, (p. 6,) gave oc|ca&s;ion to a very remarkable act, for the very pur|po&s;e chiefly of a&s;&s;erting the &s;overeignty of parlia|ment. Acts of Parliament do not take place on &s;uch occa&s;ions until the mi&s;chief to be remedied is already at &s;ome degree of ripene&s;s; and ac|cordingly it appears, that the colonies had for a con&s;iderable time previous to 1696, &s;hewn a di&s;|po&s;ition to doubt, to di&s;pute, and in &s;ome &s;ort to oppo&s;e the authority of the Engli&s;h Parliament. Their eyes began to be open, and nature made them feel their inherent rights as men, long be|fore

they could define them. On the other hand, fal&s;e definitions of law and right, have as long &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed the feelings of equity in the minds of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the power. Let us make true definitions, and con&s;ult our true feelings, and we &s;hall then no longer doubt of the right of in|dependence in the Americans; I &s;ay true feelings, becau&s;e, without we are circum&s;pect, we are continually acquiring fal&s;e ones, as well as fal&s;e opinions; and the latter has a wonderful power in generating the former. Witne&s;s the daily and perpetual &s;everities we &s;ee practi&s;ed towards chil|dren, to the injury both of body and mind, by in|judicious parents, who yet want neither humani|ty nor tenderne&s;s, and who act upon principle. A fal&s;e &s;y&s;tem begetting fal&s;e feelings, while they are injuring and puni&s;hing their children, they think they are &s;erving them and con&s;ulting their true happine&s;s; and they con&s;equently feel &s;elf-approbation for a conduct that ought to in&s;pire horror and &s;elf-reproof. Now, with regard to our American children and kindred, let us dive&s;t our&s;elves of every intere&s;t, of every pa&s;&s;ion, of eve|ry prejudice; let us pluck from our hearts that deep-rooted love of rule, and for a moment put our&s;elves in their places; and then, deliberately and &s;olemnly laying our hand upon our heart, remembering that we are chri&s;tians, and an&s;wera|ble at the awful tribunal of the Deity for our ve|ry thoughts; let us a&s;k our&s;elves the&s;e plain que&s;|tions: is not the end of government to the Ame|ricans the &s;ame as to all other people, that is to &s;ay, the welfare and happine&s;s of the &s;ociety?

Can there be welfare and happine&s;s without free|dom? Can freedom exi&s;t under a taxation, at the di&s;cretion of the legi&s;lature of another, and that a di&s;tant, a luxurious, a nece&s;&s;itous country? Is it agreeable to common-&s;en&s;e to imagine, that an American repre&s;entation in the Briti&s;h-Parliament could an&s;wer the true ends of repre&s;entation to the people of that country? or, is it po&s;&s;ible, ac|cording to any plan which human wi&s;dom hath yet conceived, that the Parliament of Great-Bri|tain &s;hould govern the many and multiplying na|tions of America on the true principles of free|dom, or without a certainty of &s;inking her&s;elf un|der the weight of empire? And is it fit that, on the authority of a few logical di&s;tinctions, (ad|mitting they were ju&s;t, which, by the way, they are not) and for the &s;ake of proudly maintaining an ab&s;olute, a decea&s;ed claim to an empty &s;ove|reignty, (for &s;o it is confe&s;&s;ed to be, by its advo|cate the Dean) that we &s;hould forget all the&s;e con|&s;iderations, all the ties of con&s;anguinity and af|fection, all the feelngs of humanity, and the di|vine le&s;&s;ons of our holy religion, and enforce the obedience of the Americans to an odious tyranny by fire and &s;word?</P>
<P>It is matter of the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment to me, that a writer, &s;o learned and &s;o clear &s;ighted as the Dean, &s;hould have &s;o far over-looked all arguments of this nature, as to have left him&s;elf without a ju&s;t, a moral rea&s;on, as well as a political one, for his propo&s;ed &s;eparation. As to the matter of fact, concerning the po&s;&s;ibility of keeping the &s;ove|reignty in our hands he and I are well agreed,

as I have already &s;hewn in my quotation from p. 12; nay, we both agree, that we have it not to keep, that it is already gone, never to be reco|vered but by conque&s;t, never more to be held but with greater armies, and at a greater expence than ever this country &s;upported in any war.

their authority over their American colonies but very imperfectly, in as-much as they can|not re&s;train them from breaking through tho&s;e rules and regulations of exclu&s;ive trade, for the &s;ake of which all colonies &s;eemed to have been originally founded.

and Great Britain into one common empire; or, if this propo&s;al &s;hould be found imprac|ticable, whether on account of the difficulties attending it on this &s;ide the Atlantic, or becau&s;e that the Americans them&s;elves would not con|cur in &s;uch a mea&s;ure; then,</P>
<P>Thirdly, to declare open war again&s;t them as rebels and revolters; and after having made a perfect conque&s;t of the country, then to govern it by military force and de&s;potic &s;way; or if this &s;cheme &s;hould be judged (as it ought to be) the mo&s;t de&s;tructive, and they lea&s;t eligible of any; then,</P>
<P>Fourthly, To propo&s;e to con&s;ent that Ame|rica &s;hall become the general &s;eat of empire, and that Great-Britain and Ireland &s;hould be governed by viceroys &s;ent over from the court-re&s;idencies either at Philadelphia or New-York, or at &s;ome other American imperial city; or, if this plan of accommodation &s;hould be ill|dige&s;ted by home-born Engli&s;hmen, who, I will venture to affirm, would never &s;ubmit to &s;uch an indignity; then,</P>
<P>Fifthly, to propo&s;e to &s;eparate entirely from the colonies, by declaring them to be a free and independent people, over whom we lay no claim, and then by offering to guarentee this freedom and independence again&s;t all foreign invaders whom&s;oever.</P>
<P>Now, the&s;e being all the plans which, in the nature of things, &s;eem capable of being pro|po&s;ed, let us examine each of them in their or|der.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="95" REF="014673_0093_0F948C0D5152A588">
I &s;hall not need my&s;elf to accompany the Dean throughout this examination, in order to point out the fatal policy of attempting, and total im|practicability of executing, any one of the four fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;chemes, &s;ince he has done it &s;o ef|fectually him&s;elf as to need no a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But though I agree with him in the re&s;ult, that they are all both impolitic and impracticable, yet I differ widely from him in &s;everal arguments in|troduced in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and no le&s;s in the fundamental principles he frequently argues from. When he talks of the mother country governing 'in the manner &s;he ought to do;' (p. 18) and according to the original terms of the con&s;titution, I pre&s;ume we are to under&s;tand the con&s;titution to be &s;ome one individual con|tract between the mother country and her race of colonies, &s;ome certain deed &s;igned and &s;ealed be|tween them and her in due form. Is this the &s;ame con&s;titution he told us of in p. 94, of which Magna Charta was the ba&s;is? But if terms or conditions be the marks of our con&s;titution, it may indeed be a colony charter, a marriage act, a &s;tamp act, or, in &s;hort, any act of Parliament, or of the crown either, &s;o that it will be a mat|ter of very little con&s;equence, whether it have Magna Charta for its ba&s;is, or any ba&s;is at all, be&s;ides that of the &s;tatute in being. Since he lays &s;o much &s;tre&s;s on tho&s;e original terms, by which the colonies are bound to &s;uffer their re&s;|pectable mother to govern as he thinks <Q>&s;he ought to do,</Q> let us warn him not to rely too much upon analogical rea&s;oning, &s;ince it is apt
<PB N="96" REF="014673_0094_0F948C0E8CEAA018">
to prove too much. If he means that Great-Britain ought to be obeyed by her colonies, be|cau&s;e &s;he is their mother, becau&s;e &s;he produced them, and gave them their law, and that her contracts with them, when in their infancy ought to bind them forever, he would do well to remember, that no civil contract, between a parent and an infant child, affecting the future property of that child, can po&s;&s;ibly have any va|lidity, becau&s;e of the child's being, at the time, in the power of the parent; becau&s;e it dares not object to it, it cannot reject any terms &s;he may plea&s;e to dictate. I need not tell our author, that in the eye of the law, and agreeable to the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, &s;uch a contract is e&s;teemed no better than a fraud, or an act of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t tyranny.</P>
<P>Before I take my final leave of the four fir&s;t of our author's propo&s;als, I mu&s;t make two ob&s;ervations upon what appears on the face of them. In the fir&s;t place, let me reque&s;t the reader to mark attentively the obvious &s;entiment, the unambiguous language of the &s;econd pro|po&s;al. When the Dean is off his guard, and when the mi&s;taken principles he adopted, re&s;pect|ing the &s;overeignty of parliament over America, are for a moment out of &s;ight, &s;ee how naturally, how unavoidably he allows all I contend for!&mdash;Here he admits, by direct and unavoidable im|plication, that parliament hath not the rights of &s;overeignty over America; he admits, that Ame|rica is not a part of the Briti&s;h empire, or he could not po&s;&s;ibly propo&s;e <Q>to atempt to per&s;uade
<PB N="97" REF="014673_0095_0F948C0EF3B64030">
the colonies to &s;end repre&s;entatives to &s;it in the Briti&s;h parliament, in order to incorporate America and Great Britain into one common empire.</Q> In the next place, I want to know, when, under the idea of an union, he has propo&s;ed to con&s;ent, that the &s;eat of empire be transferred from Great Britain to America, why <Q>every home-born Engli&s;hman</Q> &s;hould con&s;ider it as <Q>&s;uch an indignity,</Q>&mdash;The an&s;wer is plain, becau&s;e he would become a &s;lave; and while America &s;hall be governed at We&s;tmini&s;ter, the Americans will be &s;laves. If our dignity con&s;i&s;t in governing other nations again&s;t their wills, it is a dignity we ought to be a&s;hamed of; but if it be the genuine offspring, and the a&s;&s;ociate of our liberty and independence, in God's name let our American kindred enjoy it as well as our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>We now come to the con&s;ideration of the Dean's fifth and la&s;t propo&s;al of an amicable and friendly &s;eparation, concerning which he very ju&s;tly demands p. 50, <Q>and, in fact, what is all this but natural, and even the nece&s;&s;ary corollary to be deduced from each of the former rea&s;ons and ob&s;ervations?</Q> For, if we neither can govern the Americans, nor be governed by them; if we can neither unite with them, nor ought to &s;ubdue them, what remains, but <Q>to part with them on as friendly terms as we can?</Q> This propo&s;al, and the invincible arguments in its &s;upport, make ample amends for all the errors in the foregoing parts of his work. He &s;hews him&s;elf to be ma&s;ter of this
<PB N="98" REF="014673_0096_0F948C0FB340C5F8">
part of his &s;ubject; and it cannot be too much recommended to tho&s;e whom I addre&s;s in the&s;e letters, and to the people in general, to make them&s;elves well acquainted with what he advan|ces. His much &s;uperior knowledge of our American commerce, places the good policy of a &s;eparation from America in a much &s;tronger point of light than it was in my power to have done: but I flatter my&s;elf, I have &s;ufficiently proved, that we could not have kept that coun|try in &s;ubjection without being tyrants. When ju&s;tice and policy both point the &s;ame way, no|thing but determined wickedne&s;s, or a wilful blindne&s;s can occa&s;ion us to take a wrong cour&s;e. With the favour of the reader, I mu&s;t here re|peat one of the fir&s;t ob&s;ervations I made on the Dean's work, as it &s;trikes me afre&s;h with re|doubled force every time I con&s;ider it, and and that is, that the propo&s;ed declaration of the independence of America, is a conclu&s;ion in di|rect oppo&s;ition to his original premi&s;es. In his ab&s;tract rea&s;onings on government, and the re|lation of colonies to the parent &s;tate, he falls&mdash;the common fate of genius on flippery ab&s;tract ground, into an error in fundamentals, laying it down as a principle, that 'parliament hath the rights of &s;overeignty over America;' and con&s;equently, that 'America is actually a part of the Briti&s;h empire.'</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principles he &s;ets out upon; but behold the re&s;ult of all his &s;ubtle, all his la|boured rea&s;onings!&mdash;At the end of a &s;econd work upon the &s;ubject, and after exhau&s;ting the
<PB N="99" REF="014673_0097_0F948C10D20ACE10">
chaotic trea&s;uries of &s;ophi&s;try for arguments in &s;upport of the&s;e principles, he concludes with a propo&s;al to the legi&s;lature, to declare that par|liament doth not claim the&s;e rights. Nay, but a minute before, and, as I have ob&s;erved when off his guard, he acknowledges that parliament hath not the&s;e rights, and even propo&s;es 'to at|tempt to per&s;uade the colonies to agree to an uni|on.' There is &s;omething too irreconcileable in the idea as before remarked, of giving up one's rights, in order to promote one's intere&s;t; but fal&s;e principles will ever produce fallacious rea|&s;onings. How can we po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay more for an amicable &s;eparation from America, than that the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of it took, as it were by &s;torm, a mind naturally &s;trong and vigorous, and forti|fied with all the powers of art again&s;t the attack! The Dean, in journeying to the great, the im|perial city of truth, who&s;e eternal foundations occupy a rock that overlooks the country around, unfortunately &s;ets off in a mi&s;t of prejudice.</P>
<P>Sometimes he takes a direct contrary cour&s;e; &s;ometimes intervals of a clearer light keep him &s;teady in the right road; but then again, as the den&s;ity of the mi&s;t either totally ob&s;tructs his view, or di&s;covers truth in faint glimmerings, he fre|quently deviates into bye paths and hollow ways, to the danger of being lo&s;t, even when near his journey's end. At la&s;t, however the &s;un of con|viction bur&s;ts forth in meridian blaze, the mi&s;t is gone, and he arrives at the eternal city. But after having thus propo&s;ed a &s;eparation, <Q>as the the only means of living in peace and harmony

He took the helm in a &s;torm, when no other mini&s;ter was to be found who could guide it; and he has given us through|out his admini&s;tration, very ample proofs of his intrepidity? Are we not, at this moment under a general con&s;ternation at what may be the con&s;e|quences of his intrepidity? Shall he dare in a &s;ingle act that has no precedent, to &s;hock this whole nation? Shall he dare to hurl a ra&s;h and mi&s;guided vengeance on the town of Bo&s;ton, and bid a bold defiance to all America, and yet want courage to adopt a mea&s;ure of the greate&s;t wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; a mea&s;ure which, to execute, he may e&s;teem the glory of his life?

<P>There are conjunctures in the affairs of king|doms when none but an intrepid &s;tate&s;man can &s;tem a head-long torrent of popular zeal, or avert a gathering &s;torm which threatens his authority. If the urgent nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e &s;hall not admit of temperate mea&s;ures, but &s;hall demand a daring act of temporary violence, &s;uch a &s;tate&s;man, if he be wi&s;e and virtuous al&s;o, will avail him&s;elf of the &s;hort-lived calm that &s;ucceeds the conflict, and before the di&s;contents of the people can break forth afre&s;h with redoubled and irre&s;i&s;table im|petuo&s;ity, he will effectually remove them, by removing their cau&s;es, and by giving them a &s;e|curity again&s;t future alarms.

<P>(1) The Bo&s;ton Port Bill.</P>
<P>(2) Notwith&s;tanding the act for the better regulating the govern|ment of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, and notwith&s;tanding the Quebec Act, I will not yet part with my hope, that the eyes of the legi&s;lature will &s;oon be opened; and that the&s;e acts, as well as the other, will only prove temporary acts of violence. They have all been pa&s;&s;ed before the minds of the mini&s;ters have had time to cool.</P>
<P>(3) I would not have the reader imagine, I mean to ju&s;tify every tarring and feathering rioter at Bo&s;ton, and all di&s;orderly pro|ceedings in America indi&s;criminately. Some of the people, I doubt not, may have been to blame; for the commonalty of that country mu&s;t have had a portion of wi&s;dom and patience, which hath not at any time before been found in the world, had all their expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment for ill u&s;age, been confined within the bounds of moderation. When governors become tyrants, &s;hall we wonder, that an injured and in&s;ulted people become riot|ous and unruly! Have ambitious and encroaching rulers ever yet thought of rendering <HI>&s;atisfaction,</HI> of making <HI>reparation,</HI> for the cruelle&s;t injuries they have &s;o con&s;tantly committed; and have they not always thought them&s;elves wonderfully gracious and conde&s;cending, when they have merely <HI>cea&s;ed to oppre&s;s?</HI> but if a free people, finding their humble petitions, and mo&s;t dutiful remon&s;trances &s;cattered to the winds with contempt, be|ing &s;tung with a &s;en&s;e of accumulated wrongs, and feeling an in|dignation at being treated like &s;laves and villains, do but a&s;&s;ault the meane&s;t mi&s;creant in the train of power; 'tis rebellion! felony! trea&s;on! Goals and gibbets, ball and bayonet, mu&s;t here be the correctives. Is this human polity! Are the&s;e the proceedings of men, of fellow creatures, of fellow chri&s;tians?
<PB N="103" REF="014673_0101_0F948C149B188218">
When merely <HI>cea&s;ing to oppre&s;s,</HI> is all the reparation required for a long train of injuries and in&s;ults; &s;hall authority, with whom wi&s;dom ought ever to re&s;ide, become deaf to that voice which called her into being, and think it meritorious to per&s;i&s;t in doing wrong?</P>
<P>So univer&s;ally have I heard the Bo&s;tonians condemned for de|&s;troying the <HI>tea,</HI> and the action pronounced illegal and rebellious, that I have taken &s;ome pains to examine all the particulars of that affair. Now, to my agreeable di&s;appointment, and to the be&s;t of my judgment, in&s;tead of an act of rebellion, I find it one reflecting honour, and &s;tamping the character of good &s;ubjects, on tho&s;e who performed it; in&s;tead of being illegal it appears to me to be warranted by the law of nature, the great original of all human laws, when ju&s;t. Tho&s;e who would wi&s;h to think ju&s;tly, and to &s;peak hone&s;tly of this matter, will do well to examine for them&s;elves. When they &s;hall have &s;o done, with care and candour, and admitting on my part, for the &s;ake of taking no advantage in the argument, the Bo&s;tonian character to be as black as malignantly repre&s;ented, I &s;hould be glad to propo&s;e to them this plain que&s;tion: <Q>What was po&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t wi&s;e and virtuous per&s;ons on earth, in the place of the Bo&s;tonians, to have done, in order to have performed their duty to the utmo&s;t towards God and their Country?</Q>&mdash;To have &s;hewn a pa&s;&s;ive obedience to an unju&s;t act of parliament, in a ca&s;e of &s;uch mo|ment, and of &s;o critical a nature, would have been trea&s;on to their country, and therefore not acceptable, I imagine, to God. I have introduced in various conver&s;ations, with &s;en&s;ible men, the &s;ame que&s;tion I here propo&s;e, but never yet, I can aver with the &s;tricte&s;t veracity, have I met with a &s;olution of it, which did not confirm me in an opinion, that as wi&s;e and virtuous men, as good citizens, and true patriots, <HI>they could not po&s;&s;ibly have acted otherwi&s;e than as they did.</HI></P>
<P>They had only this one alternative; they were driven to this dilemma by their magi&s;trates, <HI>either to &s;uffer an in&s;idious attempt again&s;t their &s;acred rights and liberties to take effect, or to de&s;troy the hated in&s;trument.</HI> Having had <HI>no other choice,</HI> they mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily have either <HI>done</HI> this, or <HI>&s;uffered</HI> that. Which ought to be have been cho&s;en by every brave and hone&s;t man, I leave the reader to determine. 'Tis vi&s;ionary, even to childi&s;hne&s;s, to &s;ay, they might have permitted the tea to have been landed, and yet have defeated the tax, by unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ing to have purcha&s;ed it. The conductors of that noble action mu&s;t have been patriots indeed, and mo&s;t wonderfully wi&s;e, to have left their country, by going this way to work, at the di&s;cretion and mercy of the mo&s;t ignorant and vicious of its inhabitants, to have relied upon the prudence and &s;elf-denial of every tea-drinker in America!

that the wi&s;dom of each well-meaning individual was not to be de|pended on for fore&s;eeing all the ill con&s;equences of purcha&s;ing a pound of tea, nor their re&s;olution in preventing them; I fear there might have been &s;ome traitors to the public cau&s;e, &s;ome tools of government or the India Company, or &s;ome &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons at lea&s;t, in whom to have confided, for not &s;etting the ex|ample, and u&s;ing all their cunning to &s;educe others, would not have argued any extraordinary degree of prudence.</P>
<P>What teacher of morals or politics, ever was lunatic enough to build all his hopes of &s;erving his country, on an expectation of bringing <HI>every individual</HI> of it to be of one mind, and as unani|mou&s;ly to act up to the &s;ame rigid principle of virtue? and which of us would care to ri&s;k the &s;afety of the city of London from &s;ome dreadful calamity, on a confidence that every female, from the fine lady to the wa&s;herwoman, every man, from the mini&s;ter of &s;tate down to the blackguard, might be prevailed upon totally to ab&s;tain from the u&s;e of tea, porter, or gin, <HI>except the temptation was re|moved out of their way.</HI></P>
<P>To all my readers, except tho&s;e unhappy ones, who have learn|ed the fatal art of occa&s;ionally clo&s;ing the mental eye, &s;o as to ad|mit ju&s;t &s;o much, and no more of the light of truth as their pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices will bear; I mu&s;t needs think, it would be reflecting upon their under&s;tandings and their ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, to attempt any farther proof of my propo&s;ition, that the Bo&s;tonians did what was &s;trictly con&s;onant to right and ju&s;tice in de&s;troying the tea; but, in order to open the &s;elf-clo&s;ed, winking eyes of the prejudiced, I will propo&s;e one more compari&s;on, which, I apprehend, will be admitted as a fair one, &s;ince it is agreed on all hands, except by the calm advancers of direct fal&s;ehoods and lies, and the bold denyers of demon&s;tration, that with regard to taxa|tion, the coloni&s;ts, as legitimate &s;hoots from a parent &s;tock of freedom, have at lea&s;t an equal right to be their own tax-ma&s;ters as the people of Ireland, which was a conquered, and every one knows, a very rebellious kingdom for many ages.</P>
<P>Let then the reader only &s;ub&s;titute Ireland and Dublin, for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay and Bo&s;ton, and try the cau&s;e over again in his own mind. If he plea&s;es, we will &s;uppo&s;e, that in&s;tead of a duty on tea, we &s;hould attempt to touch the pockets of the Iri&s;h, by a duty on certain &s;tamped papers, being publications of gro&s;s im|moralities and bla&s;phemies, tending to debauch the minds of the people, and fit them for &s;lavery; and that an a&s;&s;ocation of hone&s;t citizens of Dublin, more mindful of their duty to God and their country, than of obedience to an ordinance they held to be &s;ub|ver&s;ive of their liberties, &s;hould find this precious cargo, preci&s;ely in a &s;imilar &s;ituation with the tea at Bo&s;ton; that the Lord Mayor, the magi&s;trates, and revenue myrmidons, like the Bo&s;ton governor

and officers of Cu&s;toms, &s;hould all ab&s;olutely refu&s;e their per|mi&s;&s;ion and clearances for its departure from the port, and the &s;hip &s;hould be well impri&s;oned by &s;urrounding batteries; then, what is to be done? what cour&s;e is to be pur&s;ued? Shall tho&s;e, who ought to be the guides and guardians of the city, admit the&s;e pernicious compo&s;itions within their walls; patiently behold them di&s;played in the &s;hops, hawked about the &s;treets, and di&s;per&s;ed throughout the country, with every art of invitation to tho&s;e in|clined to purcha&s;e?</P>
<P>Is the city to be deluged with the&s;e impieties, and it's man|ners, morals, and liberties undermined, rather than <HI>an united company of merchants trading in mi&s;chief</HI> &s;hould lo&s;e their property? a property not only detrimental in it&s;elf, but in this ca&s;e made a venture, with the direct intention of betraying a brave and generous nation into obedience to a de&s;potic ordinance, containing in it the &s;eeds of a more complete tyranny, and u&s;ed as the mo&s;t tempting bait to lure the &s;illy multitude into the political mou&s;e|trap; and therefore, on the principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and agreeable to the &s;pirit of the law of nature and nations, &s;ubject to be de&s;troyed, <HI>if not removed upon fair warning.</HI> Are the city guardians, I &s;ay, to ob&s;erve all this, and content them&s;elves all the while with a patriotic re&s;olve, not to buy or to read a &s;ingle paper, and with preaching to the unli&s;tening people to follow their example? If this, in the enlightened and virtuous city of Dublin, would be an experiment, that even a driveller would hardly dream of making; how much le&s;s &s;afe would it have been for the American patriots to have hazarded their all, on the univer|&s;al good &s;en&s;e, on the piety and public &s;pirit of the people, in the <HI>&s;tupid,</HI> the <HI>hypocritical,</HI> the <HI>impious,</HI> the <HI>ungrateful,</HI> and <HI>rebellious</HI> town of Bo&s;ton!</P>
<P>What then, I once more a&s;k, ought the patriots of Dublin or of Bo&s;ton to have done? What! but with indignation to have ca&s;t the hated in&s;trument of tyranny into the &s;ea! whither its pro|prietors de&s;erved al&s;o to have followed it headlong. Is it for this wi&s;e, brave, and generous action, that not only the actors of it, but the whole people of Bo&s;ton, are now &s;marting under the heavie&s;t vengeance of Great-Britain! of a people who have hi|therto ju&s;tly prided them&s;elves in being the undaunted re&s;i&s;ters of tyrants! Fie, boa&s;ters, fie! Britannia blu&s;hes for your degenera|cy; &s;he di&s;owns ye for her &s;ons. When a pawnbroker knowingly puts arms into the hands of a highwayman or ruffian, does any law in&s;ure to him payment for the &s;ame, at the hands of any one who being a&s;&s;aulted, &s;eized and de&s;troyed them?

<P>I mu&s;t therefore repeat, that the de&s;troyers of the tea at Bo&s;ton were, in my opinion, a band of virtuous patriots, who&s;e names, when once made public, will doubtle&s;s be held in eternal venera|tion by their countrymen; and that the glorious <HI>illegality</HI> (if every &s;tatute, <HI>whether ju&s;t or unju&s;t,</HI> be properly comprehended in the word law) they atchieved, was an act of ab&s;olute moral and poli|tical <HI>nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and therefore exempt from even good laws; of &s;in|gular wi&s;dom, of &s;trict ju&s;tice, and remarkable temper and forbear|ance, con&s;idering their provocations &s;ince it was done in <HI>&s;elf-de|fence,</HI> with the greate&s;t good order and decency, and unaccom|panied with incivility to any one, or the &s;malle&s;t damage to any thing in the &s;hips be&s;ides the treacherous tea.

&s;eparate &s;tate, and dictate the terms of general ac|commodation without any fear of even <HI>future</HI> di&s;|&s;atisfactions. To deny the&s;e conclu&s;ions, would be to deny that effects follow their cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The author of the tracts has already proved, that it is not our power, but the &s;uperior advan|tage of our trade, which &s;ecures to us the com|merce of the Americans, or that can &s;ecure it to us. We &s;hall &s;till have the &s;ame power to awe America into a faithful ob&s;ervance of her treaties, that we now have, to enforce a di&s;puted and odi|ous &s;overeignty, and with this manife&s;t advan|tage, that treating with each &s;tate &s;eparately, we &s;hall only have one at a time to contend with; whereas we have experienced by our &s;tamp and tea projects, that while we pretend to govern the whole, the whole will unite to re&s;i&s;t us.</P>
<P>That bond of union once di&s;&s;olved, and the na|tural and nece&s;&s;ary jealou&s;y of each other taking place, Great-Britain, as the common umpire, will become in effect the general &s;overeign, &s;o long as &s;he interpo&s;es her good offices for maintaining the common independence; and this her own intere&s;t will always dictate. Great Britain, will of cour&s;e take care, in the fir&s;t place, to recover all her debts in America, which, in&s;tead of bad debts, as they are now too ju&s;tly e&s;teemed to be, will, in the tran&s;ports of their gratitude for a de|clared and guaranteed independence, be punctu|ally paid, though with their la&s;t &s;hilling. Not to mention that fear of offending, (for Great-Bri|tain will then become truly formidable to each &s;eparate &s;tate) would effectually produce this ef|fect
<PB N="113" REF="014673_0111_0F948C2097A9EC20">
we &s;hall, by the league &s;ecure on the mo&s;t la&s;ting foundation, every advantage of trade with America we now enjoy, and by the &s;eparation relieve our&s;elves from many heavy expences it now co&s;ts us; for a proof of which, I again refer to the Dean's work: we may then di&s;band &s;o much of our expen&s;ive and uncon&s;titutional &s;tand|ing army, as we now keep up on account of A|merica; and in&s;tead of being execrated, as we now are, for that fleet which blocks up their ports, and is commi&s;&s;ioned to humble Bo&s;ton to the du&s;t, and through her &s;ides, to gall every province on the continent, they will readily con|&s;ent to its pre&s;ence for &s;eeing to the exact ful|filling of their treaties, and they will then look upon it with a friendly&punc; an affectionate and re|&s;pectful eye, while they con&s;ider it as their &s;ure protector again&s;t inva&s;ion, their refuge in di&s;tre&s;s, and the avenger of their wrongs.&mdash;Not being able to pay Great-Britain in &s;ub&s;idies of ready money for her protection and friend&s;hip, they will grant her an equivalent in <HI>exclu&s;ive trade;</HI> and they will enter into &s;ome general &s;tipulation for the mode and the mea&s;ure of payment for any &s;uch extraordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;hips as they may at any time &s;olicit, or we, penetrating the de&s;igns of our common enemies, may &s;end to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

the face of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier be &s;een in North-America.</P>
<P>A Flanders or a Germany, on the other &s;ide of the globe would be a grave wide enough to &s;wallow the whole &s;trength and trea&s;ure of this kingdom. The Americans are in no condition to &s;et them&s;elves up as a maritime power, or to &s;upport a navy fit to guard their own coa&s;ts, but mu&s;t rely upon Great-Britain for their &s;afety by &s;ea, as indeed it will ever be their intere&s;t &s;o to do, knowing by experience, that with regard to them, <HI>&s;he is not a conquering,</HI> but a commercial &s;tate; and having rea&s;on to conclude, that a con|federacy of their maritime &s;tates would probably terminate, like that of Greece, in wars upon one another, and be perverted to an&s;wer the ends of ambition to &s;ome one, in&s;tead of protection to all. After what has been &s;aid, I need not point out (but for the &s;ake of my timid and uninformed reader) that it will be totally unnece&s;&s;ary, and unbecoming the dignity of parliament, to he&s;itate a moment in pa&s;&s;ing the act of declaration, for fear the Americans &s;hould not afterwards con&s;ent to the league. 'Tis ab&s;urd to imagine they will act in contradiction to the principles of <HI>&s;elf intere&s;t and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation,</HI> merely becau&s;e they &s;hall be free from controul; nor is it more po&s;&s;ible to conceive, how they &s;hould object to a treaty with Great-Britain, merely becau&s;e &s;he had ju&s;t done them an act of magnanimity and genero&s;ity un|parallelled in hi&s;tory, and given them an unde|niable proof, that &s;he was intitled to their un|bounded confidence, particularly in its not being

po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould have <HI>any de&s;ign upon their li|berties.</HI> Be&s;ides Great-Britain, until &s;he have re&s;igned her a&s;&s;umed &s;overeignty as the mother country, cannot, on the principles of equity, as before illu&s;trated, give any validity to a contract with her children, while held in &s;ubjection to her authority. No! the generous &s;pirit that &s;hall &s;et them free, will di&s;dain the meanne&s;s of a proceeding &s;o little and &s;o di&s;tru&s;tful; and that wi&s;dom which could form &s;o comprehen&s;ive a plan, will de&s;pi&s;e the crookedne&s;s and folly of &s;uch a narrow policy.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a faint &s;ketch of the many and great benefits of an American league&mdash;the reader's imagination and judgment will fini&s;h the picture. If then he can think, that they do not infinitely preponderate again&s;t the advantages to be hoped for from per&s;i&s;ting to a&s;&s;ert our odious &s;overeignty, and plundering the colonies by ar|bitrary tax-gathers, I have only to &s;ay, that he and I can &s;carcely be made of the &s;ame common materials of humanity; but I &s;hall begin to li&s;ten to tho&s;e profound &s;ages, who&s;e acute penetration, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a certain micro&s;copic &s;pecies of philo|&s;ophy, hath di&s;covered, that the Mo&s;aic revela|tion is a fable, and that, in&s;tead of one, there are indeed many different races of men. On the one hand, the mo&s;t we can expect is a forced and reluctant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, with &s;ome advantages in trade; but the&s;e even for a very, <HI>very &s;hort period.</HI> Mean while, di&s;content and dete&s;tation, brooding in the bo&s;oms of the coloni&s;ts, will na|turally generate a rancorous hate and abhorrence;

which, aided by our re&s;tle&s;s enemies the French, will &s;hortly terminate in defiance and revenge. On the other hand&mdash;but repetition is needle&s;s. In &s;hort, the multiplying millions of America, mu&s;t either be our deadly foes, or our &s;teadfa&s;t friends. Great-Britain, take thy choice!</P>
<P>What remains, but that we renew our appeal to the manly &s;en&s;e and magnanimity of the great council of this kingdom; a kingdom, great and happy above all the kingdoms of the earth; a council the mo&s;t augu&s;t in the whole world, as nur&s;ed in the bo&s;om of freedom, and trained in the true principles of ju&s;t government and pure religion, of which they are the guardians! If men, thus favoured of heaven, thus enlightened, thus elevated, &s;hall not &s;et examples of &s;terling virtue, where, alas! &s;hall we find it? Con&s;ult then your own hearts, ye legi&s;lators of Great-Britain! Be true to your own feelings, and let the moral &s;en&s;e prevail. If ye are con&s;cious of a love of power, know that 'tis the genuine offspring of the love of liberty. This the root, that the branch. If your hearts be held in the curling branch's clo&s;e embrace, think how, in the hearts of all men, the tenacious root &s;trikes to the bottom, and twines it's cla&s;ping &s;ibres around the very &s;prings of life, never to lo&s;e their hold!</P>
<P>Remember that ye are now to decide on the fate of nations&mdash;perhaps your own. Remember the great legi&s;lator beholds your doings. Be your doings like unto his doings. Be tender to hu|manity; be firm to freedom; be inflexible to ju&s;tice. Emancipate in one god-like act, a long

roll of nations, who&s;e names it is tedious to re|count. In one act, lift up the well-plea&s;ing name of Great-Britain to Heaven, and &s;pread her matchle&s;s fame to the ends of the wondering earth. The depth of her wi&s;dom, the tran&s;cen|dency&punc; of her virtue, &s;hall be unexampled, and this act remain a monument of her great feli|city, an everla&s;ting model of ju&s;tice, and a theme of prai&s;e to all nations, and to all ages.

<P>(1) In order to obviate &s;ome objections, which, I fore&s;ee, both well meaning and ill de&s;igning per&s;ons may be ready to offer to this part of my propo&s;al, let me ob&s;erve to them, that this nego|ciation will not be attended with tho&s;e difficulties and embarra&s;s|ments, which their imaginations or their artifice may po&s;&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t. We may pre&s;ume, that our commi&s;&s;ioners would have the outlines of the propo&s;ed league ready &s;ketched out, from the mo&s;t approved general regulations of the acts of trade and navi|gation, which now relate to the colonies collectively, and taking in &s;uch other conditions as &s;hould be evidently calculated for the mutual benefit of Great Britain and North-America; one as the planting, the other as the manufacturing country; one as the cli|ent, the other as the patron.

<PB N="118" REF="014673_0116_0F948C25734A9D80">
&s;hould be any in&s;uperable difficulties &s;tarted by them, when they &s;hould come to enter into their re&s;pective &s;eparate treaties.</P>
<P>How the trade of a colony can be limited, and its manufactures re&s;tricted by the mother-country, on the principles of ju&s;tice, <HI>ex|cept with its own free con&s;ent,</HI> I confe&s;s I have not eyes to di&s;cover. If it can be made appear, that the Briti&s;h Parliament hath a right to &s;ay to an American, <Q><HI>you &s;hall not</HI> make a hat to cover your head, nor a &s;hoe to defend your foot; <HI>you &s;hall not</HI> manufacture a piece of cloth to keep out the cold, nor a knife wherewithal to cut your victuals; why, I pray, may it not likewi&s;e &s;ay, give us the money out of your pocket?</Q> To obtain a little money may be thought, and by Mr. Grenville and his di&s;ciples was thought, as <HI>convenient</HI> to the &s;tate, as the employment of our manufacturers.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving, that not only the unrea&s;oning multitude, but the members in both hou&s;es of Parliament, minority as well as majo|rity, not even excepting the hone&s;t oppo&s;ers of American taxati|on, all &s;eemed to agree, that Great-Britain hath a right to bind the colonies by her regulations and re&s;trictions in and upon their trade, navigation and manufactures; I, for a long time, &s;uffered my own rea&s;on to be borne down, and my feelings &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of &s;uch re&s;pectable, though not infallible authority; but, the &s;elf evident fallaciou&s;ne&s;s of this propo&s;ition for ever re|curring upon me, and &s;triking my mind with redoubled force every time I con&s;idered it, I was at la&s;t obliged to yield to the force of an irre&s;i&s;tible internal conviction, and to reject that doc|trine as erroneous, and as a national prejudice, ari&s;ing from <HI>prece|dents,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by the mother country, when her children were helple&s;s new born babes, and carefully in&s;tilled into their minds while growing up, as among the &s;acred precepts of filial piety; from the &s;elf-flattering and &s;elf-intere&s;ted &s;ugge&s;tions of Briti&s;h minds; and from the general acknowledgement of the Americans them&s;elves. One of their judicious and truly patriotic writers (before referred to p. 30. in a note to the fir&s;t letter) on this head, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus:&mdash;<Q>Great-Britain has prohibited the manufacturing iron and &s;teel in the&s;e colonies, without any objection to her <HI>right</HI> of doing it. The like right &s;he mu&s;t have to prohibit any other manufacture among us. Thus &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an undi&s;puted <HI>preceaent</HI> on that point. This au|thority, &s;he will &s;ay, is founded on the <HI>original intention</HI> of &s;ettling the&s;e colonies; that is, that &s;he &s;hould manufacture for them, and that they &s;hould &s;upply her with materials. The <HI>equity</HI> of this policy, &s;he will al&s;o &s;ay, has been univer|&s;ally acknowledged by the colonies, who never have made the lea&s;t objection to &s;tatutes for that purpo&s;e; and will further appear, by the mutual benefits &s;lowing from this u&s;age, ever &s;ince the &s;ettlement of the&s;e colonies.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Our great advocate, Mr, Pitt, in his &s;peeches on the de|bate, concerning the repeal of the <HI>&s;tamp-act,</HI> acknowledged,
<PB N="119" REF="014673_0117_0F948C265DB63F38">
that Great Britain could re&s;train our manufactures. His words are the&s;e:&mdash;This kingdom, as the &s;upreme governing and legi&s;lative power,</Q> [even this great man hath not got over the little idea of nations remaining in perpetual &s;ubjec|tion to nations from which they &s;prang] has ALWAYS <Q>bound the colonies by her regulations and RESTRICTIONS in trade, in navigation, in MANUFACTURES, in every thing, <HI>except that of taking the money out of their pockets,</HI> WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. Again, he &s;ays, we may bind their trade, CONFINE THEIR MANUFACTURES, and exerci&s;e every power whatever, <HI>except that of taking their mo|ney out of their pockets,</HI> WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.</Q> [The&s;e are pretty large conce&s;&s;ions to the pride and ambition of Great Britain, and yet &s;he is not &s;atisfied with them.] <Q>Here then, my dear countrymen, ROUSE you&s;elves, and behold the ruin hanging over your heads. If you ONCE ad|mit, that Great Britain may lay duties upon her exportations to us, <HI>for the purpo&s;e of levying money on us only,</HI> &s;he will then have nothing to do, but to lay tho&s;e duties on the articles which &s;he prohibits us to manufacture,&mdash;and the tragedy of American liberty is fini&s;hed. We have been prohibited from procuring manufactures, in all ca&s;es any where, but from <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> (except linens, which we are permitted to import directly from Ireland.) We have been prohibited, in &s;ome ca&s;es, from manufacturing for our&s;elves, and may be prohibited in others. We are, therefore, exactly in the &s;itu|ation of a city be&s;ieged, which is &s;urrounded by the works of the be&s;iegers in every part <HI>but one.</HI> If that is clo&s;ed up, no &s;tep can be taken, <HI>but to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion,</HI> If Great Bri|tain can order us to come to her for nece&s;&s;aries we want, and can order us to pay what taxes &s;he plea&s;es before we take them away, or when we land them here, we are as abject &s;laves as France or Poland can &s;hew in wooden &s;hoes and with uncomb|ed hair.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Perhaps the nature of the nece&s;&s;ities of dependent &s;tates, cau&s;ed by the policy of a governing one, for her own benefit, may be elucidated by a fact mentioned in hi&s;tory. When the Carthaginians were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the i&s;land of Sardinia, they made a decree, that the Sardinians &s;hould not rai&s;e <HI>corn,</HI> nor get it any other way <HI>than from the Carthaginians.</HI> Then, by impo&s;ing any taxes they would upon it, they drained from the mi&s;erable Sardinians any &s;ums they plea&s;ed; and whenever that oppre&s;&s;ed people made the lea&s;t movement to a&s;&s;ert their liberty, their tyrants &s;tarved them to death, or &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>But why, I want to know, are the colonies to be held for ever in the &s;ituation of <HI>cities be&s;ieged?</HI> Why is the mother-country to be the <HI>&s;ole judge</HI> of &s;uch re&s;trictions as may be con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>ori|ginal
<PB N="120" REF="014673_0118_0F948C26F497C690">
intention</HI> of &s;ettling colonies; &s;eeing that this original inten|tion was not, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the intention of the <HI>legi&s;lature,</HI> but the intention of <HI>the emigrants them&s;elves,</HI> when they fled from per|&s;ecution, mi&s;ery, and want, to take &s;helter in the more friendly wilds of America? Why are the &s;elfi&s;h and arbitrary terms pre|&s;cribed by <HI>one party,</HI> to be implicitly received by the <HI>other,</HI> in a commercial affair of <HI>mutual concern,</HI> and profe&s;&s;ed by the dic|tating party, to be for their <HI>mutual advantage? Voluntary con&s;ent</HI> and <HI>agreement, independent bargain</HI> and <HI>contract,</HI> are in the very e&s;&s;ence of all <HI>equitable</HI> dealings in trade. I pre&s;ume the Ame|ricans may be as good judges, as the people who ridiculou&s;ly <HI>a&s;|&s;ume the right</HI> of judging for them, what it is <HI>their</HI> advantage to re&s;trict them&s;elves to in manufactures and trade; and will be ready to take care to confine them&s;elves to &s;uch branches, as will be mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with that fir&s;t political maxim, of &s;ecuring at all events, <HI>the protection of Great-Britain,</HI> and her <HI>valuable trade,</HI> from which they have benefits to expect, that no other European market can yield them. To acknowledge their independency, and to form with them a friendly league, is therefore the only method, <HI>on the principles of equity,</HI> of laying them under re&s;tric|tions in trade and manufactures, for the exclu&s;ive advantage of their protectors; but continuing to impo&s;e the&s;e re&s;trictions by <HI>our own authority</HI> and by <HI>force,</HI> as it deeply affects them in their property, by <HI>preventing money coming into their pockets,</HI> (which is very nearly allied, when done unju&s;tly, to <HI>taking it out of their pockets without their con&s;ent</HI>) is undoubtedly tyrannical.</P>
<P>When our legi&s;lators, and others, dive&s;ting them&s;elves of every &s;elfi&s;h and arbitrary bias, (the characteri&s;tics of little and uncultivated minds) and guarding again&s;t all &s;ugge&s;tions, but tho&s;e of truth, ju&s;tice, and benevolence, &s;hall have duly reflected on this very important que&s;tion, I flatter my&s;elf they will per|ceive the wi&s;dom of our <HI>anticipating</HI> the Americans in a candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of it, and will agree with me, in &s;entiment, that America cannot&punc; according to any ideas of ju&s;tice or freedom, be laid under re&s;trictions of any kind, for the purpo&s;e of &s;trengthening and aggrandizing the &s;tate or legi&s;lature of Great Britain, <HI>except with her free-will and con&s;ent,</HI> independently and volunta|rily given by expre&s;s &s;tipulation and contract; and con&s;equently, that they will &s;ee the moral as well as the political nece&s;&s;ity, for the propo&s;ed DECLARATION and LEAGUE; and that, in fact, it remains for Great Britain to choo&s;e, whether by acting the deaf and haughty tyrant, &s;he &s;hall &s;ink her&s;elf into poverty and con|tempt, or, by a conduct worthy her&s;elf and her boa&s;ted know|ledge, and love of freedom, &s;he &s;hall render her&s;elf, not only the all-powerful guarantee of the independence, and monopolizer of the trade of America, but at the &s;ame time the dreaded, the dictatorial arbiter of Europe.</P>

<P><HI>AMERICAN Independence the intere&s;t and Glory of Great-Britain.</HI> A New Edition, To which is added a copious Appendix, containing two additional Let|ters to the Legi&s;lature; a Letter to Edmund Burke, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> controverting his Principles of American Government. And a Po&s;t&s;cript, containing new Agruments on the Subject; a Draught of a Bill propo&s;ed to be brought into Parliament for re&s;toring Peace and Harmony between Great-Britain and Briti&s;h America, and for perpetuating the &s;ame. Together with the e&s;&s;ential Materials for a propo&s;ed grand Briti&s;h League and Confederacy, to be entered into by Great-Britain and all the <HI>States</HI> of Briti&s;h Ame|rica: The whole of which &s;hews beyond Denial or Doubt, that by granting the Coloni&s;ts an un|re&s;trained civil Freedom and <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> Indepen|dence

<P>Of the former edition of this performance an account was given in our Review for November la&s;t. Re&s;pecting the Appendix, it may be pro|per to ob&s;erve, that in the letter to Mr. Burke our Author's general opinions of the right of the Coloni&s;ts are applied in oppo&s;ition to the argu|ments which had been alledged to &s;upport the American Declaratory Act. The propo&s;ed Bill for rendering the Colonies independent of the le|gi&s;lative authority of Parliament is founded on tho&s;e principles of which we before gave a general account; but the particular application of them in the 'draught' before us well de&s;erves con&s;ider|ation. The latter part of the Po&s;t&s;cript contains &s;everal important additional propo&s;als, re&s;pecting the future admini&s;tration of government in the &s;everal &s;tates, as parts of the propo&s;ed 'Grand Briti&s;h League and Confederacy,' among which we &s;hall extract the following:</P>

<P>"During the &s;hort &s;pace of time indeed that remains of that winter's day, to the evening of which we may hope to continue the de&s;potic lords of North-America, tho&s;e immen&s;e divi&s;ions of country we have affected to make by our char|ters and by act of parliament on a late memorable occa&s;ion, may, like all other arbitrary compen|diums, be <HI>convenient to us,</HI> &s;o long as we deter|mine to continue arbitrary rulers; or it might hereafter be favorable to the ambition of &s;ome one American &s;tate hungering to &s;wallow up its neighbours, to have its territory like that of the ambitious Catherine reaching from the &s;alt ocean to the fre&s;h water &s;eas in midland, and thence to the &s;alt ocean again quite acro&s;s the va&s;t con|tinent; but in neither ca&s;e would it be de&s;irable or good for <HI>the people of tho&s;e countries."</HI></P>

We have already enumerat|ed in the foregoing draught for an act of parlia|ment eighteen &s;tates already formed; and by &s;uch a divi&s;ion of the remaining country by the grand confederacy as we have propo&s;ed, provi&s;ion might be made for the future gradual and quiet e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of nineteen more at lea&s;t, all of ample extent, and every one having a very con&s;iderable frontier acce&s;&s;ible to &s;hipping and upon waters which are at this time navigated by the Briti&s;h navy."</P>
<P>"Thus each of the&s;e numerous &s;tates, by the &s;ame means that would enable it through com|merce to become a re&s;pectable member of the grand Briti&s;h confederacy, would be effectually &s;ubject to the controul and influence of Great-Britain, their common maritime protector and umpire, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the harmony of the whole. According to this &s;y&s;tem no &s;tate adjoining to the two great rivers &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;hores on both &s;ides; as navigations of &s;uch magnitude and importance &s;hould be always boundaries and frontier."</P>

<P>THESE Letters were publi&s;hed (in London) a few months &s;ince. The Writer con&s;iders the American Colo|lonies as di&s;tinct independent States. His arguments are chiefly derived from the &s;pirit of our Con&s;titution, and the liberal principles of rea&s;on and equity, on which he contends, that communities governed by a power in which they have neither controul or participa|tion, are in a &s;tate of &s;lavery.&mdash;That the freedom and happine&s;s of a people &s;uper&s;ede every po&s;&s;ible claim of government&mdash;That mankind have a better right to pre&s;erve their liberties than any power can have to abridge them&mdash;That the di&s;tance of the colonies ren|ders it impo&s;&s;ible to govern them by autho|rity of parliament, without &s;ubverting the principles of all free Governments.</P>
