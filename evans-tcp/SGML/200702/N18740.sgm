<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Captivity, Sufferings &amp; Deliverance, OF Mrs. Jemima Howe.</HEAD>
<P>AS Me&s;&s;rs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 27, 1755.</NOTE> Caleb Howe, Hilkiah Grout, and Benjamin Gaffield, who had been hoeing corn in the meadow, we&s;t of the river, were returning home, a lit|tle before &s;un&s;ent, to a place called Bridgman's Fort, they were fired upon by twelve Indians, who had ambu&s;hed their path. Howe was on hor&s;eback, with two young lads, his child|ren, behind him. A ball, which broke his thigh, brought him to the ground. His hor&s;e ran a few rods and fell likewi&s;e, and both the lads were taken. The Indians in their &s;avage manner, coming up to Howe, pierced his body with a &s;pear, tore off his &s;calp, &s;tuck a hatchet in his head, and left him in this for|lorn condition. He was found alive the morning after, by a party of men from Fort Hin&s;dale; and being a&s;ked by one of the par|ty whether he knew him, he an&s;wered, yes, I know you all. The&s;e were his la&s;t words, though he did not expire until after his friends had arrived with him at Fort Hin&s;dale. Grout was &s;o fortunate as to e&s;cape unhurt. But Gaffield, in attempting to wade through the river, at a certain place which was indeed
<PB N="4" REF="024343_0003_0FC61F7B6308AC78">
fordable at that time, was unfortunately drowned. Flu&s;hed with the &s;ucce&s;s they had met with here, the &s;avages went directly to Bridgman's Fort. There was no man in it, and only three women and &s;ome children, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Mrs. Jemima Howe, Mrs. Submit Grout, and Mrs. Eunice Gaffield. Their hu&s;bands, I need not mention again, and their feelings at this juncture I will not attempt to de&s;cribe. They had heard the enemies guns, but knew not what had happened to their friends. Ex|tremely anxious for their &s;afety, they &s;tood longing to embrace them, until at length, concluding from the noi&s;e they heard without that &s;ome of them were come, they unbarred the gate in a hurry to receive them; when lo! to their inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;appointment and &s;urpri&s;e, in&s;tead of their hu&s;bands, in ru&s;hed a number of hideous Indians, to whom they and their tender offspring became an ea&s;y prey; and from whom they had nothing to expect, but either an immediate death, or a long and doleful captivity. The latter of the&s;e, by the favor of Providence, turned out to be the lot of the&s;e unhappy women and their &s;till more unhappy, becau&s;e more helple&s;s, children. Mrs. Gaffield had but one, Mrs. Grout had three, and Mrs. Howe &s;even. The elde&s;t of Mrs. Howe's was eleven years old, and the younge&s;t but &s;ix months. The two elde&s;t were daughters, which &s;he had by her fir&s;t hu&s;band, Mr. William Phipps, who was al&s;o &s;lain by the Indians, of which, I doubt not
<PB N="5" REF="024343_0004_0FC61F7CDD47A6B8">
but you have &s;een an account in Mr. Doolit|tle's hi&s;tory. It was from the mouth of this woman that I lately received the foregoing account. She al&s;o gave me, I doubt not, a true, though to be &s;ure, a very brief and im|perfect hi&s;tory of her captivity, which I here in&s;ert for your peru&s;al. It may perhaps af|ford you &s;ome amu&s;ement, and can do no harm; if after it has undergone your critical in&s;pection, you &s;hould not think it (or an a|bre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">tion of it) worthy to be pre&s;erved among the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ords you are about to publi&s;h.</P>
<P>The Indians (&s;he &s;ays) having plundered and put fire to the Fort, we marched as near as could judge, a mile and a half into the wools, where we encamped that night. When the morning came, and we had advanced as much farther, &s;ix Indians were &s;ent back to the place of our late abode, who collected a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> more plunder, and de&s;troyed &s;ome other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that had been left behind,; but they did not return until the day was &s;o far &s;pent, that it was judged be&s;t to continue where we were, through the night. Early the next morning we &s;et off for Canada, and continued our march eight days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, until we had reached the place where the Indians had left their canoes, about fifteen miles from Crown Point. This was a long and tedious march; but the captives, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, were enabled to endure it with le&s;s trouble and difficulty, than they had rea&s;on to expect. From &s;uch &s;avage ma&s;ters, in &s;uch indigent
<PB N="6" REF="024343_0005_0FC61F7F09320CB8">
circum&s;tances, we could not rationally hope for kinder treatment than we received. Some of us, it is true, had a harder lot than others; and, among the children, I thought my &s;on Squire had the harde&s;t of any. He was then only four years old, and when we &s;topped to re&s;t our wearly limbs, and he &s;at down on his ma&s;ter's pack, the &s;avage mon&s;ter would often knock him off; and &s;ometimes too, with the handle of his hatchet. Several ugly marks, indented in his head by the cruel Indians, at that tender age, are &s;till plainly to be &s;een.</P>
<P>At length we arrived at Crown Point, and took up our quarters there, for the &s;pace of near a week. In the mean time &s;ome of the Indians went to Montreal, and took &s;everal of the weary captives along with them, with a view of &s;elling them to the French. They did not &s;ucceed, however, in finding a market for any of them. They gave my younge&s;t daughter, Submit Phipps, to the Governor, de Vaudreuil, had a drunken frolick, and re|turned again to Crown Point, with the re&s;t of their pri&s;oners. From hence we &s;et off for St. John's, in four or five canoes, ju&s;t as night was coming on, and were &s;oon &s;urrounded with darkne&s;s. A heavy &s;torm hung over us. The found of the rolling thunder was very terrible upon the waters, which at every fla&s;h of expan&s;ive lightning, &s;eemed to be all in a blaze. Yet to this we were indebted for all the light we enjoyed. No object could we di&s;cern any longer than the fla&s;hes la&s;ted.
<PB N="7" REF="024343_0006_0FC61F8014DF6DF8">
In this po&s;ture we &s;ailed in our open tottering canoes, almo&s;t the whole of that dreary night. The morning indeed had not yet begun to dawn, when we all went a&s;hore; and having collected a heap of &s;and and gravel for a pil|low, I laid my&s;elf down, with my tender infant by my &s;ide, not knowing where any of my other children were, or what a mi&s;erable condition they might be in. The next day, however, under the wing of that ever pre&s;ent and all-powerful Providence, which had pre|&s;erved us through the darkne&s;s, and imminent dangers of the preceding night, we all arrived in &s;afety at St. Johns.</P>
<P>Our next movement was to St. Francois, the metropolis, if I may &s;o call it, to which the Indians, who led us captive, belonged. Soon after our arrival at their wretched capi|tal, a council, con&s;i&s;ting of the chief Sachem, and &s;ome principal warriors of the St. Fran|cois tribe, was convened; and after the cere|monies u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions, were over, I was conducted and delivered to an old &s;quaw, whom the Indians told me, I mu&s;t call my mother. My infant &s;till continuing to be the property of its original Indian owners. I was neverthele&s;s permitted to keep it with me a while longer, for the &s;ake of &s;aving them the trouble of looking after it, and of maintaining it with my milk. When the weather began to grow cold, &s;huddering at the pro&s;pect of approaching winter, I acquainted my new mother that I did not think it would be po&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="8" REF="024343_0007_0FC61F8AB9826598">
for me to endure it, if I mu&s;t &s;pend it with her, and fare as the Indians did. Li&s;ten|ing to my repeated and earne&s;t &s;olicitations, that I might be di&s;po&s;ed of among &s;ome of the French inhabitants of Canada, &s;he, at length, &s;et off with me and my infant, at|tended by &s;ome male Indians, upon a journey to Montreal, in hopes of finding a market for me there. But the attempt proved un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, and the journey tedious indeed. Our provi&s;ions were &s;o &s;canty as well as in&s;ipid and un&s;avory, the weather was &s;o cold, and the travelling &s;o very bad, that it often &s;eem|ed as if I mu&s;t have peri&s;hed on the way. The lips of my poor child were &s;ometimes &s;o benumbed, that when I put it to my brea&s;t, it could not, till it grew warm, imbibe the nouri&s;hment requi&s;ite for its &s;upport. While we were at Montreal, we went into the hou&s;e of a certain French gentleman, who&s;e lady, being &s;ent for, and coming into the room where I was, to examine me, &s;eeing I had an infant, exclaimed &s;uddenly in this manner, <Q>Damn it, I will not buy a woman that has a child to look after.</Q> There was a &s;will|pail &s;tanding near me, in which I ob&s;erved &s;ome cru&s;ts and crumbs of bread &s;wiming on the &s;urface of the grea&s;y liquor it contained: Sorely pinched with hunger, I &s;kimmed them off with my hands and eat them; and this
<PB N="9" REF="024343_0008_0FC61F8C06F7D810">
was all the refre&s;hment which the hou&s;e af|forded me. Some where in the cour&s;e of this vi&s;it to Montreal, my Indian mother was &s;o unfortunate as to catch the &s;mall pox, of which di&s;temper &s;he died, &s;oon after our re|turn, which was by water, to St. Francois.</P>
<P>And now came on the &s;ea&s;on when the In|dians begun to prepare for a winter's hunt. I was ordered to return my poor child to tho&s;e of them, who &s;till claimed it as their proper|ty. This was a &s;evere trial. The babe clung to my bo&s;om with all its might; but I was obliged to pluck it thence, and deliver it, &s;hrieking and &s;creaming, enough to penetrate a heart of &s;tone, into the hands of tho&s;e un|feeling wretches who&s;e tender mercies may be termed cruel. It was &s;oon carried off by a hunting party of tho&s;e Indians, to a place call|ed Me&s;&s;i&s;kow, at the lower end of Lake Champlain, whither, in about a month after, it was my fortune to follow them. I had pre&s;erved my milk, in hopes of &s;eeing my be|loved child again. And here I found it, it is true, but in a condition that afforded me no great &s;atisfaction; it being greatly emaciated, and almo&s;t &s;tarved. I took it in my arms, put its face to mine, and it in&s;tantly bit me with &s;uch violence, that it &s;eemed as if I mu&s;t have parted with a piece of my cheek. I was per|mitted to lodge with it that, and the two fol|lowing
<PB N="10" REF="024343_0009_0FC61F8D551D9BF0">
nights; but every morning that inter|vened, the Indians, I &s;uppo&s;e on purpo&s;e to torment me, &s;ent me away to another wig|wam, which &s;tood at a little di&s;tance, though not &s;o far from the one in which my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed infant was confined, but that I could plainly hear its ince&s;&s;ant cries, and heart rending la|mentations. In this deplorable condition I was obliged to take my leave of it, on the morning of the third day after my arrival at the place. We moved down the Lake &s;ever|al miles the &s;ame day; and the night follow|ing was remarkable on account of the <HI>great earthquake</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">November 18, 1755.</NOTE> which terribly &s;hook that howling wilderne&s;s. Among the i&s;lands hereabouts we &s;pent the winter &s;ea&s;on, often &s;hifting our quarters, and roving about from one place to another; our family con&s;i&s;ting of three per|&s;ons only, be&s;ides my&s;elf, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> my late mother's daughter, whom therefore I called my &s;i&s;ter, her &s;anhop, and a pappoo&s;e. They once left me alone two di&s;mal nights; and when they returned to me again, perceiving them &s;mile at each other, I a&s;ked what is the matter? They replied, that two of my child|ren were no more: One of which, they &s;aid, died a natural death, and the other was knocked on the head. I did not utter many words, but my heart was &s;orely pained within
<PB N="11" REF="024343_0010_0FC61F94E354FF88">
me, and my mind exceedingly troubled with &s;trange and awful ideas. I often imagined, for in&s;tance, that I plainly &s;aw the naked car|ca&s;es of my decea&s;ed children hanging upon the limbs of the trees, as the Indians are wont to hang the raw hides of tho&s;e bea&s;ts which they take in hunting. It was not long, how|ever, before it was &s;o ordered by kind Provi|dence, that I &s;hould be relieved in a good mea&s;ure from tho&s;e horrid imaginations; for as I was walking one day upon the ice, ob|&s;erving a &s;moke at &s;ome di&s;tance upon the land, it mu&s;t proceed, thought I, from the fire of &s;ome Indian hut, and who knows but &s;ome one of my poor children may be there. My curio&s;ity, thus excited, led me to the place, and there I found my &s;on Caleb, a little boy between two and three years old, whom I had lately buried, in &s;entiment at lea&s;t; or rather imagined to have been deprived of life, and perhaps al&s;o denied a decent grave. I found him likewi&s;e in tolerable health and circum&s;tances, under the protection of a fond Indian mother; and moreover had the hap|pine&s;s of lodging with him in my arms one joyful night. Again we &s;hifted our quarters, and when we had travelled eight or ten miles upon the &s;now and ice, came to a place where the Indians manufactured &s;ugar which they extracted from the maple trees. Here an In|dian
<PB N="12" REF="024343_0011_0FC61F99171EE648">
came to vi&s;t us, whom I knew, and could &s;peak Engli&s;h. He a&s;ked me why I did not go to &s;ee my &s;on Squire. I replied that I had lately been informed that he was dead. He a&s;&s;ured me that he was yet alive, and but two or three miles off, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Lake. At my reque&s;t he gave me the be&s;t directions he could to the place of his abode. I re&s;olved to embrace the fir&s;t opportunity that offered of endeavoring to &s;earch it out. While I was bu&s;y in contemplating this affair, the Indians obtained a little bread, of which they gave me a &s;mall &s;hare. I did not ta&s;te a mor&s;el of it my&s;elf, but &s;aved it all for my poor child, if I &s;hould be &s;o lucky as to find him. At length, having obtained of my keepers leave to be ab&s;ent for one day. I &s;et off early in the morning, and &s;teering, as well as I could, according to the directions which the friendly Indian had given me, I quickly found the place, which he had &s;o accurately marked out. I beheld, as I drew nigh, my little &s;on without the camp; but he looked, thought I, like a &s;tarved and mangy puppy, that had been wallowing in the a&s;hes. I took him in my arms, and he &s;poke to me the&s;e words, in the Indian tongue: "Mother, are you come?' I took him into the wigwam with me, and ob&s;erving a number of Indian children in it, I di&s;tributed all the bread
<PB N="13" REF="024343_0012_0FC61F9ADF2ED578">
which I had re&s;erved for my own child, a|mong them all, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have given great offence. My little boy appeared to be very fond of his new mother, kept as near me as po&s;&s;ible while I &s;taid, and when I told him I mu&s;t go, he fell as though he had been knocked down with a club. But having rec|ommended him to the care of Him that made him, when the day was far &s;pent, and the time would permit me to &s;tay no longer, I departed, you may well &s;uppo&s;e with a heavy load at my heart. The tidings I had received of the death of my younge&s;t child had, a little before, been confirmed to me be|yond a doubt, but I could not mourn &s;o heart|ily for the decea&s;ed, as for the living child.</P>
<P>When the winter broke up, we removed to St. John's; and, through the en&s;uing &s;um|mer, our principal re&s;idence was at no great di&s;tance from the fort at that place. In the mean time, however, my &s;i&s;ter's hu&s;band having been out with a &s;couting party to &s;ome of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, had a drunken frolick at the fort, when he returned. His wife, who never got drunk, but had often ex|perienced, the ill effects of her hu&s;band's in|temperance fearing what the con&s;quence might prove, if he &s;hould come home in a moro&s;e and turbulent humour, to avoid his in&s;olence, propo&s;ed that we &s;hould both re|tire,
<PB N="14" REF="024343_0013_0FC61F9E960C2270">
and keep out of the reach of it, until the &s;torm abated. We ab&s;conded accordingly, but &s;o it happened, that I returned, and ven|tured into his pre&s;ence, before his wife had pre&s;umed to come nigh him. I found him in his wigwam, and in a &s;urly mood; and not being able to revenge upon his wife, becau&s;e &s;he was not at home, he laid hold of me, and hurried me to the fort; and, for a trifling con&s;ideration, &s;old me to a French gentleman, who&s;e name was Saccapee. 'Tis an ill wind certainly that blows no body any good. I had been with the Indians a year lacking four|teen days; and, if not for my &s;i&s;ter, yet for me, 'twas a lucky circum&s;tance indeed, which thus at la&s;t, in an unexpected moment, &s;natched me out of their cruel hands, and placed me beyond the reach of their in&s;olent power.</P>
<P>After my Indian ma&s;ter had di&s;po&s;ed of me in the manner related above, and the moment of &s;ober reflection had arrived, perceiving that the man who bought me had taken the ad|vantage of him in an unguarded hour, his re&s;entments begun to kindle, and his indigna|tion ro&s;e &s;o high, that he threatened to kill me if he &s;hould meet me alone, or if he could not revenge him&s;elf thus, that he would &s;et fire to the fort. I was therefore &s;ecreted in an upper chamber, and the fort carefully
<PB N="15" REF="024343_0014_0FC61FA13A135EE0">
guarded, until his wrath had time to cool. My &s;ervice in the family to which I was now ad|vanced, was perfect freedom, in compari&s;on of what it had been among the barbarous In|dians. My new ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were both as kind and generous towards me as I could any ways expect. I &s;eldom a&s;ked a fa|vor of either of them, but it was readily granted: In con&s;equence of which I had it in my power, in many in&s;tances, to admini&s;|ter aid and refre&s;hment to the poor pri&s;oners of my own nation, who were brought into St. John's during my abode in the family of the above-mentioned benevolent and ho&s;pitable Saccapee. Yet even in this family &s;uch trials awaited me as I had little rea&s;on to expect, but &s;tood in need of a large &s;tock of prudence, to enable me to encounter them. Mu&s;t I tell you then, that even the good old man him|&s;elf, who con&s;idered me as his property, and likewi&s;e a warm and re&s;olute &s;on of his, at that &s;ame time, and under the &s;ame roof, be|came both exce&s;&s;ively fond of my company; &s;o that between the&s;e two rivals, the father and the &s;on, I found my&s;elf in a very critical &s;ituation indeed, and was greatly embarra&s;&s;ed and perplexed, hardly knowing many times, how to behave in &s;uch a manner as at once to &s;ecure my own virtue, and the good e&s;teem of the family in which I re&s;ided, and upon which
<PB N="16" REF="024343_0015_0FC61FA254731F68">
I was wholly dependent for my daily &s;upport. At length, however, through the tender com|pa&s;&s;ion of a certain Engli&s;h gentleman,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. Peter Schuyler, then a pri&s;oner.</NOTE> the Governor de Vaudreuil being made acquaint|ed with the condition I had fallen into, imme|diately ordered the young amorous Sacca|pee, then an officer in the French army, from the field of Venus to the field of Mars, and at the &s;ame time al&s;o wrote a letter to his father, enjoining it upon him, by no means to &s;uffer me to be abu&s;ed, but to make my &s;ituation and &s;ervice in his family as ea&s;y and delightful as po&s;&s;ible. I was moreover under un&s;peakable obligations to the Governor upon another ac|count. I had received intelligence from my daughter Mary, the purport of which was, that there was a pro&s;pect of her being &s;hortly married to a young Indian of the tribe of Saint Francois, with which tribe &s;he had continued from the beginning of her captivity. The&s;e were heavy tidings, and added greatly to the poignancy of my other afflictions. However, not long after I had heard this melancholy news, an opportunity pre&s;ented, of acquaint|ing that humane and generous gentleman, the commander in chief, and my illu&s;trious bene|factor, with this affair al&s;o, who in compa&s;&s;ion for my &s;ufferings, and to mitigate my &s;orrows, i&s;&s;ued his orders in good time, and had my daughter taken away from the Indians, and
<PB N="17" REF="024343_0016_0FC61FA493CA21B0">
conveyed to the &s;ame nunnery where her &s;i&s;ter was then lodged, with his expre&s;s injunction; that they &s;hould both of them together, be well looked after, and carefully educated, as his adopted children. In this &s;chool of &s;uper&s;ti|tion and bigotry, they continued while the war in tho&s;e days between France and Great-Britain la&s;ted. At the conclu&s;ion of which war, the Governor went home to France, took my olde&s;t daughter along with him, and married her then to a French gentleman, who&s;e name is Cron Lewis. He was at Bo&s;ton with the fleet under Count de E&s;taing, [1778] and one of his Clerks. My other daughter &s;till continuing in the nunnery, a con|&s;iderable time had elap&s;ed after my return from captivity, when I made a journey to Canada, re&s;olving to u&s;e my be&s;t endeavours not to return without her. I arrived ju&s;t in time to prevent her being &s;ent to France. She was to have gone in the next ve&s;&s;el that &s;ailed for that place. And I found it extremely dif|ficult to prevail with her to quit the nunnery and go home with me. Yea, &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, and all the per&s;ua&s;ions and arguments I could u&s;e with her, were to no effect, until after I had been to the Governor, and obtained a letter from him to the &s;uperintendant of the nuns, in which he threatened, if my daughter &s;hould not be immediately delivered into my
<PB N="18" REF="024343_0017_0FC61FA9AD7E58D8">
hands, or could not be prevailed with to &s;ub|mit to my parental authority, that he would &s;ent a band of &s;oldiers to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in bringing her away. Upon hearing this &s;he made no farther re&s;i&s;tance. But &s;o extremely bigoted was &s;he to the cu&s;toms and religion of the place, that after all, &s;he left it with the greate&s;t reluctance, and the mo&s;t bitter lamentations, which &s;he continued as we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treets, and wholly refu&s;ed to be comforted. My good friend, Major Small, whom we met with on the way, tried all he could to con&s;ole her; and was &s;o very kind and obliging as to bear us company, and carry my daughter behind him on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>But I have run on a little before my &s;tory, for I have not yet informed you of the means and manner of my own redemption, to the accompli&s;hing of which, the recovery of my daughter ju&s;t mentioned, and the ran&s;oming of &s;ome of my other children, &s;everal gentle|men of note, contributed not a little; to who&s;e goodne&s;s, therefore, I am greatly in|debted, and &s;incerely hope I &s;hall never be &s;o ungrateful as to forget. Col. Schuyler in particular was &s;o very kind and generous as to advance 2700 livres to procure a ran&s;om for my&s;elf and three of my children. He accompanied and conducted us from Mon|treal to Albany, and entertained us in the mo&s;t

friendly and ho&s;pitable manner a con&s;iderable time, at his own hou&s;e, and I believe entirely at his own expen&s;e.</P>
<P>I have &s;pun out the above narrative to a much greater length than I at fir&s;t intended, and &s;hall conclude it with referring you, for a more ample and <HI>brilliant</HI> account of the captive heroine, who is the &s;ubject of it, to Col. Humphrey's hi&s;tory of the life of Gen. I&s;rael Putnum, together with &s;ome remarks upon a few clau&s;es in it. I never indeed had the plea&s;ure of peru&s;ing the whole of &s;aid hi&s;tory, but remember to have &s;een, &s;ome time ago, an extract from it in one of the Bo&s;ton new&s;papers, in which the Colonel has extolled the beauty and good &s;en&s;e, and rare accompli&s;hments of Mrs. Howe, the per&s;on whom he endeavors to paint in the mo&s;t lively and engaging colours, perhaps a little too highly, and in a &s;tyle, that may appear to tho&s;e who are acquainted with her at this day, romantick and extravagant. And the Colonel mu&s;t needs have been mi&s;informed with re|&s;pect to &s;ome particulars that he has mentioned in her &s;tory. Indeed, when I read the extract from his hi&s;tory to Mrs. Tute, (which name &s;he has derived from a third hu&s;band, who&s;e widow &s;he now remains) &s;he &s;eemed to be well plea&s;ed, and &s;aid, at fir&s;t, is was all true, but &s;oon after contradicted the circum&s;tance of

her lover's being &s;o bereft of his &s;en&s;es when he &s;aw her moving off in a boat at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the &s;hore, as to plunge into the water after, in con&s;equence of which he was &s;een no more. It is true, &s;he &s;aid; that as &s;he was returning from Montreal to Albany, &s;he met with young Saccapee on the way, That &s;he was in a boat with Col. Schuyler, that the French officer came on board the boat, made her &s;ome hand&s;ome pre&s;ents, took his final leave of her, and departed, to outward appearance, in tolerable good hu|mour.</P>
<P>She moreover &s;ays, that when &s;he went to Canada for her daughter, &s;he met with him again, that he &s;howed her a lock of her hair; and her name likewi&s;e, printed with vermil|ion on his arm. As to her being cho&s;en agent to go to Europe, in behalf of the people of Hin&s;dale, when Col. Howard obtained from the government of New-York a patent of their lands on the we&s;t-&s;ide of Connecticut river, it was never once thought of by Hin&s;dale people until the above-mentioned extract ar|rived among them, in which the author has in&s;erted it as a matter of undoubted fact.</P>
