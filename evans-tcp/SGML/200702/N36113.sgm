<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HAVING returned from the We&s;t|ward&mdash;I now &s;it down, agreeable to your reque&s;t, to give you an account of my journey&mdash;</P>
<P>TWO days after you left my hou&s;e, Mr. <HI>Camber</HI> and my&s;elf, after providing our&s;elves with provi&s;ions, began our journey, deter|mining to penetrate the We&s;tern Wilderne&s;s as far as prudence and &s;afety would permit. We travelled for thirteen days in a we&s;terly direction, without meeting any thing uncom|mon or worthy de&s;cription, except a very great variety of birds and wild bea&s;ts, which would frequently &s;tart before us&mdash;and, as we had our mu&s;kets, contributed not a little to our amu&s;ement and &s;upport. The land we found exceedingly rich and fertile, every where well watered, and the variety of berries, nuts, ground-nuts, &amp;c. afforded a very comfortable living.</P>
<P>ON the 14th day of our travels, while we were ob&s;erving a high hill, at the foot of which, ran a beautiful &s;tream, which pa&s;&s;ing into a &s;mall plain, after a few windings, lo&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="047150_0003_102252FE7AFD97D0" MS="y">
it&s;elf in a thicket&mdash;and ob&s;erving the agreea|ble picture&s;que pro&s;pect, which pre&s;ented it&s;elf on all &s;ides, we were &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ound of a voice, which &s;eemed at no great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t we were uncertain whether the voice was an human one, or that of &s;ome bird; as many extraordinary ones inhabited the&s;e wilds. After li&s;tening &s;ome time, the voice cea&s;ed and we then determined to proceed up the hill, from whence, we judged, the &s;ound to come; that we might, if po&s;&s;ible, discover what voice it was that &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed us. Accordingly, cro&s;&s;ing the brook, we proceeded up the hill; and having arrived near the &s;um|mit, we again di&s;tinctly heard a voice &s;inging in our own language, a mournful &s;ong. When the voice cea&s;ed, we ob&s;erved a &s;mall foot path, which we followed; and arriving at the top of the hill, pa&s;&s;ing round a large rock, then thro a thicket of bu&s;hes, at the end of which, was a large opening: Upon our arrival here, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible amazement, we beheld a beautiful young Lady! &s;itting near the mouth of a cave!&mdash;She, not ob&s;erving us, began a|gain to &s;ing. We now attempted to approach her; when a dog, which we had not before ob&s;erved, &s;prung up and began to bark at us; at which &s;he &s;tarted up, and &s;eeing us, gave a &s;cream and &s;wooned away. We ran to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and having lifted her up, &s;he &s;oon recovered; and looking wild at us, exclaim|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">&mdash; Heavens! Where am I?&mdash;And who, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">m whence are you?&mdash;We de&s;ired her to be under no unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;told her we were travel|lers
<PB N="4" REF="047150_0004_10225300128A3740">
&mdash;that we came only to view the country; but that in all our travels, we had not met with any thing that had &s;urpri&s;ed us &s;o much, as her extraordinary appearance, in a place which we imagined totally unfrequented.</P>
<P>AFTER a little conver&s;ation, having con|vinced her of our peaceable di&s;po&s;itions, and that we intended her no injury, &s;he invited us into the cave, when &s;he refre&s;hed us with &s;ome ground-nuts, a kind of apples, &s;ome Indian cake, and excellent water.&mdash;We found her to be an agreeable, &s;en&s;ible Lady; and after &s;ome conver&s;ation, we reque&s;ted to know who &s;he was, and how &s;he came to this place. She very readily complied with this reque&s;t, and began her &s;tory as follows:&mdash;</P>
<P>"STRANGERS, your appearance and con|ver&s;ation, entitle you to my confidence; and, tho my &s;tory cannot be very intere&s;ting or en|tertaining&mdash;yet it may po&s;&s;ibly excite your pity, while it gratifies your curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>"I WAS born near <HI>Albany,</HI> in the year 1760&punc;&mdash;My father was a man of &s;ome con&s;e|quence, and of con&s;iderable e&s;tate in the place where he lived.&mdash;I was his only child, and had I continued with him, po&s;&s;ibly, I might have been happy. In the fifteenth year of my age, my father received into his family a young Gentleman of education, as his clerk: This young man, by his ea&s;y politene&s;s&mdash;his good &s;en&s;e, and agreeable manners, &s;oon gained the e&s;teem of all the family.&mdash;He had not been long with us, before he conceived an unfortu|nate pa&s;&s;ion for me; and, as he had frequent:
<PB N="5" REF="047150_0005_1022536DA17A82C8">
opportunities of conver&s;ing with me&mdash;his in|&s;inuating addre&s;s, added to a &s;en&s;ible, enga|ging conver&s;ation, &s;oon found way to my heart: He quickly perceived that I was not indifferent to him&mdash;and took occa&s;ion to de|clare his pa&s;&s;ion; which he did with &s;o much ardour, and yet, with &s;o much mode&s;ty, that I readily acknowledged a mutual attachment.</P>
<P>AFTER this, we &s;pent together many happy evenings, vowing mutual love, and fondly an|ticipating future happine&s;s. We were how|ever obliged to conceal our attachment from my father; who, as he was exce&s;&s;ively eager in pur&s;uit of riches, we had no rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e he would countenance our loves, or con|&s;ent to my marriage with a man de&s;titute of fortune.</P>
<P>IT happened, one evening, as we were di&s;|cour&s;ing by our&s;elves in a little garden, ad|joining our hou&s;e, that we were overheard by my father; who, either &s;u&s;pected our at|tachment to each other, or from &s;ome other motives, had purpo&s;ely concealed him&s;elf in this place, where he knew we u&s;ually walked. Next morning, my father, with an angry countenance, upbraided my lover with treach|erou&s;ly engaging his daughter's affections&mdash; and after calling him many hard names, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed him, with peremptory order never a|gain to enter his hou&s;e. It was in vain to re|mon&s;trate; he in&s;i&s;ted on being obeyed&mdash;and ordered me to my chamber, where he confin|ed me. My lover then wrote to my father, &s;tating to him our &s;ituation&mdash;reque&s;ted leave
<PB N="6" REF="047150_0006_1022536F35E21CF8">
to addre&s;s me, and informed him of our mutual engagements, with the rea&s;on for not &s;ooner con&s;ulting him. To this, my father ordered the young Gentleman to trouble him no fur|ther with his impertinence, nor ever to think of any further connection with me. By means, however, of an old &s;ervant, long attached to my lover, we found means to carry on a corre&s;pondence&mdash;and, in about a month after, we contrived matters, that I had an interview with my lover: I then agreed to quit my fath|er's hou&s;e, and retire into the country, to &s;ee whether my ab&s;ence would not &s;often his heart &mdash;and induce him to con&s;ent to my happine&s;s. I therefore packed up &s;ome clothes, and other things, and left my father's hou&s;e in the even|ing of the tenth of May, 1777, and retired &s;e|veral miles into the country, to a little hut, where my lover left me, and went in di&s;gui&s;e, to &s;ee what effect my ab&s;ence had upon my father. In five days he returned, and inform|ed me, that, my father, enraged at my elope|ment, had hired &s;everal men to &s;earch the country, in pur&s;uit of us; and that he threat|ened vengeance to us both&mdash;and declared, that he would be the death of the man who car|ried off his daughter. Thunder-&s;truck at this account, I knew not what to do&mdash;to attempt a reconciliation with my father was vain&mdash; or if po&s;&s;ible to be effected, my lover mu&s;t be &s;acrificed to it, which would make me in&s;up|portably unhappy. In order to elude the &s;earch of tho&s;e who were in pur&s;uit of us, we propo&s;ed to move further into the country,
<PB N="7" REF="047150_0007_102253717B06C378">
and there to wait till time &s;hould calm my fa|ther's rage, or effectually cool his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>WE accordingly left the hut, and travelled at an ea&s;y rate, for four days, determining to avoid being taken.&mdash;But, O! how &s;hall I re|late the horrid &s;cene that followed?&mdash;To|wards the evening of the fourth day, we were &s;urrounded and made pri&s;oners, by a party of Indians!&mdash;who led us about two miles, and then barbarou&s;ly murdered my lover! cutting and mangling him in the mo&s;t inhuman man|ner! then, after tying him to a &s;take, they kindled a fire round him! and, while he burnt, they ran round, &s;inging and dancing! rejoic|ing in their brutal cruelty!! I was at a few rods di&s;tance during this tran&s;action! and this &s;cene had well nigh deprived me of life. I fainted away, and lay &s;ome time motionle&s;s on the ground:&mdash;When I recovered my &s;en&s;es&punc; I perceived that my guard had joined his com|panions, &s;ome of whom were &s;eated round in rings, and others continued &s;inging and danc|ing. Seeing them all engaged, I withdrew by degrees, into the bu&s;hes, and being out of &s;ight, I got up and &s;tood for about an hour:&mdash; I then &s;at down by the &s;ide of a tree, and be|ing overcome by fatigue, and the &s;ight I had &s;een, I either fainted or fell a&s;leep, and knew nothing till the next morning, about &s;even o'clock. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe my feelings&mdash;or for you to conceive a &s;ituati|on more wretched than mine, at this time.&mdash; Surrounded, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, on all &s;ides with danger, I knew not what to do, without a
<PB N="8" REF="047150_0008_1022537411BBDB20">
guide to direct, or friend to protect me. Of|ten I was upon the point of returning, and endeavouring to find, and deliver my&s;elf a pri|&s;oner to tho&s;e Indians, to who&s;e cruelty I had &s;o lately been a witne&s;s; and, had I then &s;een them, I certainly &s;hould have delivered my&s;elf into there power. At length I got up, and after walking &s;ome time, I re&s;olved to &s;eek &s;ome place of &s;helter, where I might be &s;ecure from &s;torms by day, and from bea&s;ts by night; where I might dwell till a period &s;hould be put to my mi&s;erable exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>WITH this view, I wandered about for fourteen days, without knowing whither I went. By day, the &s;pontaneous produce of the earth &s;upplied me with food&mdash;by night the ground was my couch, and the canopy of hea|ven my only covering. In the afternoon of the fifteenth day I was &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing a man, of a gigantic figure, walking towards me&mdash;to run I knew would be vain, and no le&s;s vain to attempt to hide. He &s;oon came up with me, and acco&s;ted me in a language I did not under&s;tand, and after &s;urveying me for &s;ome time, he took me by the hand, and led me to his cave; having entered, pointed to a &s;tone &s;eat on which I &s;at down; he then gave me to eat &s;ome nuts and &s;ome Indian cake, af|ter which, he &s;tretched him&s;elf out on a long &s;tone, covered with &s;kins, which he u&s;ed as a bed, and &s;everal times motioned to me to lay my&s;elf be&s;ide him. I declined his offer, and at length he ro&s;e in a pa&s;&s;ion, and went into another apartment of the cave, and brought
<PB N="9" REF="047150_0009_1022537649EBDF08">
forth a &s;word and hatchet. He then motion|ed to me, that I mu&s;t either accept of his bed, or expect death for my ob&s;tinacy. I &s;till de|clined his offer, and was re&s;olved to die rather than comply with his de&s;ire. He then brought a walnut bark, and having bound me, pointing towards the ea&s;t, intimating that he left me till morning, to con&s;ider his propo&s;al; he then re|turned to his bed, and, happily for me, he &s;oon fell a&s;leep. Having the liberty of my teeth, I &s;oon made out to bite the bark in two, with which he had bound me, by which I found means to liberate my&s;elf while he continued &s;leeping. As I con&s;idered this as the only op|portunity I &s;hould have of freeing my &s;elf from him&mdash;as I expected that he would u&s;e violence when he waked, to make me partake of his bed, and, as I knew I could not e&s;cape him by flight, I did not long deliberate&mdash;but took up the hatchet he had brought, and &s;ummoning re&s;olution, I, with three blows, effectually put an end to his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I THEN cut off his head, and next day, hav|ing cut him in quarters, drew him out of the cave, about half a mile di&s;tance; when after covering him with leaves and bu&s;hes, returned to this place. I now found my&s;elf alone, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this cave, in which are &s;everal apartments. I here found a kind of Indian corn, which I planted, and have yearly rai&s;ed a &s;mall quantity. I here contented my&s;elf as well as my wretched &s;ituation would permit&mdash; here have I exi&s;ted for nine long years, in all which time this faithful Dog, which I found in the cave, has been my only companion, and
<PB N="10" REF="047150_0010_1022537966A77A30">
you are the only human beings, who ever heard me tell my tale."</P>
<P>HERE &s;he fini&s;hed her narration, and, after &s;hedding a plentiful &s;hower of tears, and a little conver&s;ation, &s;he reque&s;ted us to take re&s;t, which reque&s;t we willingly complied with.</P>
<P>NEXT morning &s;he conducted us thro' the cave, in which were four apartments, one of which appeared pretty deep in the earth, in which was a &s;pring of excellent water&mdash;in the other three were nothing very remarkable, except four &s;kulls, which we &s;uppo&s;ed were or per&s;ons murdered by the owner of the cave, or of his former companions. We found al&s;o three hatchets, four bows, and &s;everal arrows, one large tinder box, one &s;word, one old gun, and a number of &s;kins of dead bea&s;ts, and a few clothes. The bows, &s;ome arrows, the &s;word, and one hatchet, we brought, away, which are now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>AFTER continuing in the cave five days, we propo&s;ed returning home, and reque&s;ted the Lady to accompany us. At fir&s;t &s;he re|fu&s;ed to quit her cave; but after &s;ome per&s;ua|&s;ion, &s;he con&s;ented.</P>
<P>"GENTLEMEN, &s;aid &s;he, I tru&s;t my&s;elf to your protection&mdash;I have no rea&s;on to que&s;tion your good intentions, and willingly believe, from my &s;mall acquaintance with you, that you will not &s;eek to heap affliction upon a weak woman, already borne down with mi&s;|ery and &s;orrow."</P>
<P>WE together left the cave, on the morning of the &s;ixth day after our arrival in it, and tra|velling
<PB N="11" REF="047150_0011_1022537B0AF5E498">
the way we went, arrived at my hou&s;e in &s;eventeen days. After re&s;ting about a week, we accompanied the Lady, agreeable to her de&s;ire, to her father's hou&s;e&mdash; The old man did not at fir&s;t recognize his daughter, but being told who &s;he was, he looked at her for &s;ome time, and them tenderly embraced her, crying, "<HI>0 ! my child, my long lo&s;t child! I do once more &s;old thee in my arms!</HI>" He then fainted away. We with difficulty brought him to life; but the &s;cene had overcome him; he opened his eyes, and being a little recov|ered, reque&s;ted to know where &s;he had lived &s;o long, and what had happened to her, &s;ince her leaving his hou&s;e. We de&s;ired him to wait till he &s;hould be better recovered, but he beg|ged to be &s;atisfied immediately, ob&s;erving that he had but a few moments to live. She then briefly related what had happened to her, and the tragical death of her lover.&mdash; He &s;eemed much affected, and when &s;he had fini&s;hed, he took her by the hand, and affec|tionately &s;queezed it, acknowledging he had been unju&s;tly cruel to her, and a&s;ked her for|givene&s;s, and attempted to &s;ay &s;omething more &mdash;but immediately fainted; all our endeavors to recover him were in vain, he lay about &s;even hours, and then expired.</P>
<P>HE left a hand&s;ome fortune to his daughter, who, notwith&s;tanding his cruelty, was deeply affected at his &s;udden and unexpected death.
<PB N="12" REF="047150_0012_10225780F86F6340" MS="y">
This adventure, the mo&s;t &s;ingular and extra|ordinary of my life, I have communicated, agreeable to your de&s;ire, as it really happen|ed, without addition or diminution; and am Sir, your's, &amp;c.</P>
