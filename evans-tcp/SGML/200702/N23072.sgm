<P>ON the coa&s;t of Cornwall is a &s;mall vil|lage, &s;ituate on a ri&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ll, which commands a view of the &s;ea. A chapel, built on the &s;ummit, is its principal edifice; thi|ther did the hearts of its humble inhabitants repair to invoke the mercy of their Creator, and oft did they implore him to protect &s;uch of their friends and relations as were expo&s;|ed to the boi&s;terous element below it. Nor was this the only purpo&s;e to which this &s;im|ple building was adapted; frequently did its white front borrow aid from the moon, and
<PB N="4" REF="030497_0003_0FE6F54239B671D0">
&s;erved as a land mark to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed marin|ers, who were driven within its view.</P>
<P>This village, which I &s;hall call Birtland, might have been ju&s;tly de&s;cribed as &s;ecluded from the world. No proud lord u&s;urped its happy domain. No legal plunderer attended to &s;ettle tho&s;e trifling differences between man and man, which, without &s;uch interference, might be &s;oon adju&s;ted; but which, when ap|plied, frequently proves wor&s;e than the evil. At Birtland, the age of primitive innocence &s;till exi&s;ted; at Birtland, all was union and perfect tranquillity.</P>
<P>Within two miles of this happy village &s;tood an ancient ca&s;tle, formerly the re&s;idence of the hou&s;e of Ha&s;tings. Many were the illu&s;trious Earls of Huntingdon who had drawn their fir&s;t and la&s;t breath of life within its then peaceful <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. Every heir of that di&s;tingui&s;hed title <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf by deeds of unbounded munificence. They were as remarkable for their benevolence and ho&s;pitality, as the cour|tiers of the pre&s;ent age are for their arrogance and boundle&s;s ambition. At THEIR door, ne|ver was the tale of woe rejected, nor did a petitioner crave in vain. The wealthy and the indigent were equally unknown; and the hearts and pur&s;es of the&s;e noble lords were ever open to the tears of the unhappy. To obtain their protection, it was nece&s;&s;ary only to &s;olicit it; for no guileful wanderer ever bent his way to the happy but retired ca&s;tle of Led|&s;tone.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030497_0004_0FE6F5464B025818">Many centuries had pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;tate of bli&s;s, when time, which is ever working miracles, (hitherto fatal to mankind!) &s;tretched the cloud of fate over this humble corner of England. The <HI>la&s;t</HI> Earl of Huntingdon <HI>died.</HI> His gener|o&s;ity had over-reached his power, and his e&s;|tates were involved! That of Led&s;tone was an object of too much importance to be aband|oned by the rapacious creditors; it was there|fore agreed that it &s;hould be put up to &s;ale, and parted with by public auction.</P>
<P>A gentleman, the &s;on of a wealthy merchant in the city, was the highe&s;t bidder, and to him was that property con&s;igned. He was a young man, not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very &s;hining abilities, who had been educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool, and was thence &s;ent to Oxford. But &s;tudy was ill adapted to his ta&s;te; he left both the&s;e places in di&s;gu&s;t, and prevailed (but not without diffi|culty) on his father, to &s;uffer him to pa&s;s two or three years on the continent, by way of giving a fini&s;h to his education.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon after his return to England, that he determined to marry, but he had frequently the mortification to find his propo&s;als rejected. Money was no object to him, as he was &s;ure to inherit, on the death of his father, a con&s;ider|able fortune; but he wi&s;hed to ennoble his name, hitherto be&s;t known upon 'Change, and was at lenght fortunate enough to &s;ucceed in his addre&s;&s;es, with the only daughter of a new-created Iri&s;h peer, who had been &s;ucce&s;sful in his claim to the title of his ance&s;tors, and who&s;e greate&s;t advantage was her title.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="030497_0005_0FE6F5464F856380">It was &s;oon after this marriage took place, that he became the purcha&s;er of Led&s;tone, which he knew only by report&punc; having never vi&s;ited the We&s;t of England. In London, Lady Jane was equally a &s;tranger. She had pa&s;&s;ed her life in Dublin but remained unnotic|ed there until her father was created an Earl. They &s;et out for London too &s;oon afterwards for her to fix her choice among her old acquaint|ance, who were many of them at length be|come her new admirers.</P>
<P>Mr. James Martindale was the fir&s;t monied man who &s;olicited the hand of Lady Jane; and to his fortune, more than to him&s;elf, was &s;he immediately devoted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP II.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Martindale hired a ready-furni&s;hed hou&s;e in the vicinity of Portman-Square; and on the fourth of June, ju&s;t five weeks after her marriage, Lady Jane Martindale was pre&s;ented at St. James's. Her per&s;on was ra|ther hand&s;ome than otherwi&s;e, and it was on this occa&s;ion decorated with all the parapher|nalia of birth-day magnificence. To be admi|red, it was nece&s;&s;ary only that &s;he &s;hould be &s;een; and to <HI>her,</HI> the knee of adulation was &s;oon bent. The Earl of C&mdash;, on whom the fetters of matrimony &s;at lightly, was her
<PB N="7" REF="030497_0006_0FE6F551CA7064D0">
devoted &s;lave for the evening; and her eyes received an additional portion of brilliancy, as her conque&s;ts became multiplied.</P>
<P>In Mr. Martindale's bo&s;om very different were the &s;en&s;ations which aro&s;e on that occa&s;i|on. He gazed on the beauties of his wife, and his vanity was flattered by their effect, but his heart trembled as he viewed her, and the pangs of jealou&s;y racked his &s;oul. He endeavoured to appear regardle&s;s of the admiration he &s;aw la|vi&s;hed on her; but by degrees he drew nearer to the door of the antechamber, and their wait|ed with anxiety the hour of twelve, at which time his &s;ervants and equipage were ordered to attend.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as their arrival was announced, Mr. Martindale hurried Lady Jane out of the room, and attempted to put on her cloak, which a footman had given into his hands. But Lord C&mdash;di&s;puted with him th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> office, and the rules of good breeding obl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> the hu&s;band to relinqui&s;h it. Yet he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> avoid perceiving a &s;ignificant look, and a &s;queeze of the hand, which each be&s;towed on the other, as Lord C&mdash;Handed Lady Jane to her carriage; and this was, to a weak mind, almo&s;t proof po&s;itive of their guilt. But in this idea he was wholly mi&s;taken: Lord C&mdash;had not entertained an idea beyond the amu&s;ement of the pre&s;ent hour, and Lady Jane &s;aw nothing in the emaciated peer that could po&s;&s;ibly turn her thoughts towards him on the &s;ucceeding one.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="030497_0007_0FE6F551CF6FA900">The time now arrived when every fa&s;hiona|ble family prepared to leave town. Lady Jane had already made the acqui&s;ition of numberle&s;s acquaintance, but her heart had not &s;elected a friend. It was almo&s;t a matter of indifference to her whether &s;he went, and to her hu&s;band's inclinations &s;he appeared willing to accede.</P>
<P>Mr. Martindale's determination was to go to Led&s;tone; but when &s;he heard of its &s;eclu&s;ion, her heart recoiled at the idea, and &s;he reque&s;t|ed his approbation of a prior excur&s;ion to Wey|mouth or Brighthelm&s;tone. He became howe|ver ab&s;olute in his intentions; and as her father had immediately after her marriage returned to Ireland, it became nece&s;&s;ary for her to draw &s;ome one over to her intere&s;ts; nece&s;&s;ity, ra|ther than choice, directed her to old Mr. Mar|tindale. He was exactly calculated for &s;uch an employment. He had been in his younger days a general admirer of pretty women, and the charms of his new daughter-in-law lo&s;t no|thing in his opinion. He perfectly agreed with her, that to tran&s;plant a large e&s;tabli&s;h|ment <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">to the de&s;erts of Cornwall, would be attended with a heavy expence, be&s;ides the probability that exi&s;ted of their di&s;liking the &s;ituation, and &s;peedily returning. Lady Jane and the old gentleman had many conver&s;ations on the &s;ubject, and agreed to expo&s;tulate warm|ly with Mr. Martindale, whom however they had the mortification to find <HI>inexorable.</HI> All they could obtain was a few days delay, and a promi&s;e that their &s;tay in the country &s;hould not exceed &s;ix months.</P>

<P>IN a few days, part of Mr. Martindale's re|tinue &s;et forward on their journey into the We&s;t. The&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of her Lady&s;hip's un|derwoman, who was, during this &s;ummer campaign, to act al&s;o in the capacity of hou&s;e-keeper;&mdash;a French valet;&mdash;a French cook;&mdash; a running footman, and three or four more. Every thing was there in readine&s;s for the reception of the&s;e nobel and novel gue&s;ts; for the ca&s;tle was inhabited by an old &s;teward and his family, whom the late Earl of Huntingdon had &s;tationed in it; and as they had never re|ceived notice to quit the premi&s;&s;es, they &s;till enjoyed, in &s;ome of the rooms at the end of it, peacable and quite po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the&s;e imitators of greatne&s;s pa&s;&s;ed through the village of Birtland, they were &s;truck with the appearance of its humble inha|bitants; who, mi&s;taking them for their &s;uper|iors, crowded forth to bid them welcome. The bells, though few in number, echoed the&s;e warm plaudits of the heart; and every tenant, with uplifted eyes, prayed Heaven to ble&s;s them!</P>
<P>Stunned with applau&s;es for which they were unprepared, and which they did not rightly
<PB N="10" REF="030497_0009_0FE6F5530B0A85D8">
comprehend, they an&s;wered only by a loud laugh; and arriving at the ca&s;tle, where they &s;oon made them&s;elves known, were received with humble civility by the worthy &s;teward his wife, and daughter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Drapery could not help &s;huddering as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;pacious hall which led to the inhabited part of the ca&s;tle. The ma&s;&s;y door clo&s;ed with a tremendous noi&s;e; it re|&s;ounded through the vaulted roof, and petrified her with horror. On the high arched win|dows of painted gla&s;s, were handed down to po&s;terity the emblazoned arms of the newly expired title of Huntingdon; and the unwieldy armour which had formerly defended the lives of its illu&s;trious wearers, now hanging up and neglected, borrowed a faint light from the feeble glimmerings of the moon, &s;carcely &s;een enough to be ob&s;erved through the heavy ca&s;ement.</P>
<P>She reque&s;ted to be &s;hewn to the appartment allotted her, where &s;he gave orders that her fellow-tarvellers &s;hould attend. She expre&s;&s;ed to them the greate&s;t di&s;gu&s;t at every thing &s;he &s;aw, and the utter impo&s;&s;ibility there was of her being ever able to accu&s;tom her&s;elf among &s;uch Hottentots. "She was &s;ure," &s;he &s;aid,
<Q>that all Mr. Martindale's money would be but a poor compen&s;ation, if Lady Jane was to linger away the be&s;t part of her life in &s;uch an odious retirement. She wondered how he could think of bringing an Earl's daugh|ter to &s;uch a horrible di&s;tance from every
<PB N="11" REF="030497_0010_0FE6F55D2B7B83F8">
thing alive. For HER part, &s;he was &s;ure SHE could not &s;tay there, and &s;he hoped to find that her Lady would &s;oon be of the &s;ame opinion.</Q></P>
<P>In le&s;s than a week, Lady Jane and Mr. Martindale arrived at Led&s;tone. When the loquacious Mrs. Drapery &s;aw the butler (to whom &s;he was by do means aver&s;e), &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that if &s;he had not been certain of HIS coming down, &s;he could not have prevailed on her&s;elf to remain there a day after &s;he had deli|vered up her charge to her Lady; for that the place was a de&s;ert, and the evening winds were &s;o rough, that &s;he already found her con|&s;titution DAMAGED by them; and it was be|come ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her to return to London, were it only for the benefit of her health.</P>
<P>Lady Jane and Mr. Martindale, who &s;aw nothing in their new habitation otherwi&s;e than they had expected to find it, pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal days in vi&s;iting the ca&s;tle and its environs. Lady Jane was particularly attentive to the narations of the old &s;teward, who not unfrequently rub|bed his hand acro&s;s his eyes, as he dwelt on the prai&s;es of his late-loved Lord. In a &s;mall clo|&s;et adjoining the hall, of which he had entreat|ed to keep the key, he was wont to review and admire the tattered robes in which Henry third Earl of Huntingdon &s;at in judgment on the trial of the charming and unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots. The&s;e he &s;hewed Lady Jane, la|menting &s;orely the day, that, in depriving the

county of its FIRST ornament, robbed HIM of his be&s;t friend&mdash;HIS ONLY BENEFACTOR.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind of Lady Jane was by nature &s;u&s;ceptible of tender &s;entiments, and of &s;oft impre&s;&s;ions; yet her heart was as uncon&s;ci|ous of their primitive &s;ource, as of their &s;ub&s;e|quent con&s;equence; and &s;he had hitherto be|held every one with general indifference. She however po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an immoderate degree of pride and o&s;tentation, and was emulous to out|vie all who dared a&s;pire to equality with her; a&s;&s;uming a forbidding air of loftine&s;s, which often offended the &s;ocieties &s;he lived in. But, over-ruled at length by the recollection of the more exemplary conduct of &s;ome of the amiable part of her female acquaintance in London, and el&s;ewhere, &s;he in &s;ome mea&s;ure conquered that di&s;agreeable HAUTEUR; and the tender and growing impul&s;e of nature beginning to in&s;pire her with ideas more con&s;onant to the texture of her di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he became thoughtful, and rather melancholy; deriving her chief plea&s;ure from wandering in unfrequented paths, and ex|ploring and forcing tracks through the mazy and mo&s;t intricate parts of the fore&s;t, which lay at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the park.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030497_0012_0FE6F55E73FBA9B8">In one of the&s;e &s;olitary perambulations, chance had directed her &s;teps to the ruins of a very ancient, and once capacious tower, &s;ituate on the &s;umit of a &s;tupendious cliff. Thence &s;he could ob&s;erve, with the help of a &s;mall tele&s;cope which &s;he carried in her pocket, the various objects which the ocean continually pre&s;ented to her view, and which with their novelty and variety together, became every day more plea&s;|ing and intere&s;ting to her fancy.</P>
<P>Mr. Martindale ro&s;e one morning early in the month of September, before his u&s;ual hour, to take the diver&s;ion of &s;hooting; his game|keeper having apprized him the preceding even|ing of a covey of partridges which frequented a wheat-&s;tubble near a plea&s;ure ground adjoin|ing the park; not that Mr. Martindale di&s;co|vered any more enjoyment in the pur&s;uit of ru|ral plea&s;ures, than did his lady; but his time hanging rather heavy on his hands, and as &s;he did not permit him to beguile any part of it in a&s;&s;ociating with tho&s;e whom her own choice had not approved, and pointed out as proper com|panions for him, he was obliged to &s;eek amu&s;e|ment in que&s;t of plea&s;ures which nature had not given him either ta&s;te or inclination to enjoy.</P>
<P>Lady Jane had ri&s;en at her u&s;ual hour, and was preparing for breakfa&s;t, when Mr. Mar|tindale tired of his vi&s;ionary &s;cheme of plea&s;ure, returned heartily fatigued in the pur&s;uit of it.</P>
<P>The moment they had enjoyed their early repa&s;t, Lady Jane with eager &s;teps precipitate+ly
<PB N="14" REF="030497_0013_0FE6F55E79609940">
bent her way to her much-favoured &s;pot; which &s;he had no &s;ooner a&s;cended, than &s;he in|&s;tantly di&s;covered through her gla&s;s a &s;mall boat making for the &s;hore; and excited by cu|rio&s;ity, &s;he advanced with deliberate attention down the &s;andy beach, towards the edge of the water. As the boat approached nearer her view, &s;he thought &s;he perceived in it five per|&s;ons, together with &s;ome ca&s;ks which they had &s;towed, and piled up in a regular pyramid, in the &s;tern of their little bark. The tide having recently laved, and now retired from, its bea|chy limits, had cau&s;ed the &s;and under foot to be exceedingly wet; and what would have wonderfully terrified Lady Jane at any other time, and on any other occa&s;ion, now &s;timu|lated her boldly to venture on; and &s;he walked, or rather waded, almo&s;t knee-deep in the briny ocean, till &s;he came within reach of the float|ing objects which &s;he had fir&s;t di&s;covered; but having left her gla&s;s within the tower, &s;he could &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;h of what &s;ex or age the per&s;ons were, until they approached nearer.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon &s;ecurely landed in a place where &s;he had not been accu&s;tomed to meet with human beings (&s;he having dedicated this de&s;erted &s;pot to &s;olitude, and her own reflecti|ons); and the unexpected &s;ight our mariners experienced of a beautiful and elegant female, who &s;eemed to be lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment, could not fail to excite in them an equal degree of &s;urpri&s;e. After &s;ome little conver&s;ation, they reque&s;ted to be informed of the neare&s;t town,
<PB N="15" REF="030497_0014_0FE6F561E56666E0">
or village; having come, they &s;aid, on &s;hore for the purpo&s;e of procuring fre&s;h water for their ve&s;&s;el, a &s;mall brig, bound from Green|ock to London, which lay at anchor at the di&s;|tance of about two leagues.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who chiefly addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Lady Jane, appeared to be a military man, a|bout fifty years of age. He had a complacency of manner which indicated the gentleman; his countenance beaming that ineffable &s;weetne&s;s which generally be&s;peaks the mind at ea&s;e. This gentleman introduced to her his friend who accompanied him (the other three were &s;ailors, bu&s;ily employed in la&s;hing the boat to the remains of what had formerly been a light|hou&s;e.) The dre&s;s of the latter, who was ma|ny years younger, denoted him a Highlander; and the gracefulne&s;s of his mein in&s;tantly caught the attention of Lady Jane. She invited them both to the ca&s;tle, and promi&s;ed to &s;end &s;er|vants thence to render their men and boat e|very a&s;&s;i&s;tance their &s;ituation required.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al they thankfully accepted; and inwardly congratulated them&s;elves on the no|vel and &s;trange adventure with which chance had &s;o far favoured them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>ON their arrival at the ca&s;tle refre&s;hments of every kind were by Lady Jane's order &s;et before her gue&s;ts. She enquired for Mr. Martindale, but was informed by the butler that he was gone out on hor&s;eback, and had left orders to tell her lady&s;hip that he &s;hould re|turn to dinner by five. She apologized for his ab&s;ence, and entreated them to relinqui&s;h all idea of going back to their ve&s;&s;el with the evening's tide; ob&s;erving, that the days were now &s;hort and clouded&mdash;the nights long and dark; and &s;he farther alleged, that their igno|rance of the coa&s;t might lead them into un|avoidable difficulties, and imminent dangers, which &s;he would by no means advi&s;e them to encounter, and which would dimini&s;h with the return of day-light. She inwardly wi&s;hed (but from what cau&s;e &s;he knew not) that Mr. Mar|tindale &s;hould &s;ee them, and approve what &s;he had done. She felt eager to ju&s;tify her con|duct to him, perhaps from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;elf-created unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he had never before ex|perienced. Her fluttering heart beat high with a de&s;ire of &s;he knew not what; and her falter|ing tongue &s;eemed almo&s;t deprived of utterance, as her eye, involuntarily and con&s;tantly met tho&s;e of the young and accompli&s;hed Caledoni|an. She wi&s;hed, &s;he &s;aid, to detain them till
<PB N="17" REF="030497_0016_0FE6F56AE8ED18B8">
Mr. Martndale's return; and even when he did return, &s;he feared the day would be too far &s;pent for them to hazard with &s;afety the at|tempt of regaining their &s;hip:&mdash;&s;he at la&s;t hint|ed to the elder gentleman, who &s;eemed anxi|ous to depart, the kind of impropriety there would be in their going away without &s;eeing him. This objection had &s;ufficient force, to counter-balance, in their minds, every other.</P>
<P>Having drawn from them a promi&s;e &s;he too ardently wi&s;hed, &s;he reque&s;ted their attendance in the park and gardens, whither they cheer|fully con&s;ented to accompany her. In one of the walks &s;he perceived by accident that her dre&s;s had materially &s;uffered from her excur&s;i|on on the &s;ands; &s;he then left her vi&s;itors to the care of the gardener, whom &s;he directed to point out to them every object worthy their attention, and proceeded to the ca&s;tle to change her clothes; de&s;iring the gardener to re-con|duct the gentlemen there, as &s;oon as their curi|o&s;ity had been &s;ufficiently gratified.</P>
<P>On her lapy&s;hip's return &s;he retired to her appartment, and ordered her woman's atten|dance there. The article of dre&s;s, which had been neglected &s;ince her &s;eclu&s;ion in the coun|try, as a matter of indifference, now became an object of importance. Mrs. Drapery was one of tho&s;e accommodating abigails who are ever ready to flatter and encourage the follies and vices of their employers, and &s;he neglected nothing on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to adorn the per&s;on of her lady; &s;ignificantly adding,

<P>Before the etiquette of dre&s;s was finally ad|ju&s;ted, Mr. Martindale entered the room &s;ome|what abruptly; having been informed by the &s;ervants of his new vi&s;itors, and wi&s;hing, pre|vious to his &s;eeing them, to know of Lady Jane who they were, and what were the motives that had thus induced them to take up their re|&s;idence in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Lady Jane briefly related to her hu&s;band each circum&s;tance; contenting her&s;elf with ob&s;erv|ing, that although &s;he had not enquired their names, &s;he was &s;ure, from the little &s;he had &s;een of them, that they were per&s;ons of no in|ferior rank: &s;he ju&s;tly remarked that the laws of ho&s;pitality were of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the ha&s;ty zeal with which &s;he had pre&s;&s;|ed them to wait his return. Mr. Martindale coincided with her opinion, and left her to do honour to his gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, Mrs. Drapery, finding her&s;elf emboldened by her lady's vi&s;ible embarra&s;&s;ment (which together with the atten|tion to her dre&s;s had not e&s;caped her), begged pardon for informing her lady&s;hip, that &s;he knew perfectly well who the gentlemen were, having enquired of the &s;ailors, who had &s;atisfi|ed her in every re&s;pect. They were both, &s;he &s;aid, Scots. The old gentleman, who&s;e name was <HI>Stuart,</HI> had been many years Colonel of
<PB N="19" REF="030497_0018_0FE6F57305362AE0">
the <HI>Mountaineers;</HI> but had retired from the &s;ervice about two years. His lady was lately dead, and the lo&s;s of her had taken &s;uch an e|effect on his mind, that he had re&s;olved to tra|vel; and a &s;ea voyage had been particularly recommended to him, as being the mo&s;t likely to recruit both his &s;pirits and his health. The young gentleman&punc; who&s;e name was <HI>Glencairn,</HI> was di&s;tantly related to the decea&s;ed Mrs. Stu|art, who had one only child, a daughter, now educating in a convent at Calais. She was to come over on their arrival in London, and to return with them. Mrs. Drapery indeed FAN|CIED, but it was only her own conjecture, that the Colonel had thoughts of uniting the young couple; as the young gentleman had no other rea&s;on for coming over, than that of keeping the Colonel company; and of return|ing with him to Scotland, as &s;oon as Mi&s;s Stu|art &s;hould have joined them.</P>
<P>Lady Jane was not &s;o regardle&s;s as &s;he ap|peared to be of the information given by her officious waiting-woman. She, however, a&s;|&s;umed an air of compo&s;ure &s;he was doomed ne|ver more to feel, and with ha&s;ty &s;teps joined the gentlemen below.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>COLONEL Stuart had been in the mean time equally communicative to Mr. Martindale; he had con&s;idered it as incum|bent on him to introduce him&s;elf and friend to his acquaintance. Mr. Martindale, &s;oon after Lady Jane's appearance, retired to his dre&s;&s;|ing-room, whence he &s;ent to reque&s;t her at|tendance for a few minutes; when he inform|ed her, that &s;he was not mi&s;taken in the fa|vourable opinion &s;he had entertained of the &s;trangers; and proceeded to tell her all with which Colonel Stuart had made him acquaint|ed. She did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to mention to him the cenver&s;ation &s;he had held with her maid; but pretended to li&s;ten with curio&s;ity to what he related; which differed in nothing more than his &s;ilence on the &s;ubject of Mi&s;s Stuart, who &s;he naturally concluded had not been mentioned.</P>
<P>Lady Jane returned to the &s;aloon, where &s;he &s;urpri&s;ed Glencairn drawing &s;ounds of &s;weete&s;t melody from Mr. Martindale's flute, which lay on the table. He laid it down when &s;he appeared, but by her de&s;ire took it up a|gain, and played once more, at Colonel Stuart's reque&s;t,
<Q>I wi&s;h I was where Helen lies!</Q>
<PB N="21" REF="030497_0020_0FE6F57424A001D0">
in a manner &s;o peculiarly his own, that Lady Jane, for the fir&s;t time in her life, felt the power of mu&s;ic over a &s;u&s;ceptible mind. She was at that moment alive to the mo&s;t tender &s;en&s;ations; her &s;oul vibrated to the touch, and &s;he felt a pang of exqui&s;ite enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>&mdash;He cea&s;ed;&mdash;and her eyes more ex|pre&s;&s;ive than her tongue, &s;olicited his connu|ance. He &s;miled con&s;ent, and then play|ed
<Q>Ab&s;ence ne'er &s;hall alter me.</Q>
The words &s;unk deep into her heart; her fine eyes gli&s;tened;&mdash;and &s;he had but ju&s;t time to turn them on Colonel Stuart, as Mr. Martin|dale entered the room.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation became general, and din|ner was announced. It was a dome&s;tic <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and Lady Jane being without a female friend, had no excu&s;e to leave the room when it was over. Mr. Martindale and the Colonel enter|ed into a long conver&s;ation, and the old war|rior-&s;eeming for a moment to forget his griefs, gloried as he recounted his former exploits.</P>
<P>Tea, and le&s;s intere&s;ting airs on the flute beguiled the remainder of the evening; and an early &s;upper was ordered, as our vi&s;itors were under the nece&s;&s;ity of departing by day-break. Lady Jane gave orders that coffee &s;hould be prepared for them, and after an hour or two pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ocial delight, they reciprocally bade adieu.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="030497_0021_0FE6F57429657D08">The Colonel expre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Martindale his wi&s;h of meeting with him in town; but &s;aid that as he might not be appri&s;ed of the time when the Led&s;tone family arrived there; and as he was ignorant al&s;o in what part of it he &s;hould fix his &s;hort abode, he begged of Mr. Martindale to take the trouble to enquire after him at the Duche&s;s of G&mdash;'s in St. Jame's Square, who would be able to a&s;certain whe|ther he &s;till remained an inhabitant of London, or was returned (which was more likely) to the &s;eque&s;tered mountains of Scotland.</P>
<P>Lady Jane had no &s;ooner retired into her dre&s;&s;ing-room, than &s;he gave orders to Mrs. Drapery (who, as I before ob&s;erved, now acted in the double capacity of her woman and hou&s;e-keeper) to ri&s;e at a very early hour, that nothing might be wanting to complete the ele|gant ho&s;pitality the &s;trangers had experienced at Led&s;tone. She retired to bed, but did &s;he retire to re&s;t?&mdash;Ah, no!&mdash;The image of Glencairn was before her; &s;he pretended drow&s;ine&s;s, and in &s;ecret &s;ilence wept her cares to &s;leep. Mr. Martindale, fatigued by the exerci&s;e and events of the day, and uncon&s;cious of the thorns of di&s;content which invincible LOVE had &s;trewed over his wife's pillow,
<Q>Snor'd out the watch of night.</Q></P>
<P>Lady Jane li&s;tened at day break, but &s;he heard nothing. All was hu&s;hed in profound &s;ilence. They had departed an hour before their appointed time: but they had not e&s;caped
<PB N="23" REF="030497_0022_0FE6F57E144EA778">
the anxious vigilance of Mrs. Drapery; who fearful of offending her lady by not &s;eeing them, and fearful al&s;o, of her own weakne&s;s &s;hould &s;he tru&s;t her&s;elf to &s;leep, had prevailed on her friend the butler to pa&s;s the intermediate time with her in the hou&s;e-keeper's room, over a comfortable bottle of madeira, which he was to provide from the cellar as &s;oon as the family was retired to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Drapery, though a keen woman, was by no means de&s;titute of female weakne&s;s: &s;he repo&s;ed an implicit confidence in the butler, and at once informed him of her &s;u&s;picions re|lative to her lady, and the young gentleman; who (&s;he mu&s;t ob&s;erve) was of a figure to cap|tivate any lady's heart, She did not know (or had not &s;en&s;e enough to find out) that Mr. Old&s;on, the butler, was warmly in his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t; not from any ra&s;h confidence <HI>that</HI> hitherto in&s;en&s;ible ma&s;ter had repo&s;ed in him, but from a &s;en&s;e of the lucrative place he en|joyed. Mr. Old&s;on therefore made few com|ments on her ob&s;ervations, but trea&s;ured up in his mind, every circum&s;tance that might lead hereafter to a farther a&s;cendancy over Mr. Martindale; as he had already prevailed on him in many trivial occurrences, which had turned out in the end to his own advantage.</P>
<P>Soon after the bottle of madeira was ex|hau&s;ted, Mrs. Drapery told him &s;he heard a noi&s;e; but &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be too early for the &s;trangers to be thinking of their departure. She however li&s;tened, and heard it repeated;
<PB N="24" REF="030497_0023_0FE6F57E1A11B4C0">
it was, &s;he &s;aid, the &s;ound of feet gently mo|ving down the great &s;tair-ca&s;e. Mr. Old&s;on li&s;tened, but heard nothing. Mrs. Drapery &s;till per&s;i&s;ted that &s;he DID hear a noi&s;e; and as &s;he had encouraged the idea of gho&s;ts haunting the ca&s;tle, &s;he reque&s;ted Mr. Old&s;on to accom|pany her up the &s;tair-ca&s;e leading from her room; at the top of which they &s;aw our five travellers ready to depart. Mrs. Drapery's eyes in&s;tantly fixed on tho&s;e of Glencairn; who an&s;wered them by a &s;ign that he had &s;omething to communicate. It was ea&s;y for her to turn Mr. Old&s;on's attention to the other, while &s;he privately received from his hands a guinea, and a &s;lip of paper carefully folded and &s;ealed. The&s;e &s;he immediately conveyed to her pocket, while Mr. Old&s;on was making his bow to the Colonel, in acknowledgement of what he had from a very different motive conveyed to him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Drapery and Mr. Old&s;on &s;aw the tra|vellers depart, and then retired to their re|&s;pective rooms. The former cautiou&s;ly placed her pockets under her head, as fearful that her &s;ecret &s;hould be di&s;covered, and by that means the confidence of her lady be lo&s;t for ever.</P>

<P>IT was not difficult for Mrs. Drapery to under&s;tand the u&s;e it was intended &s;he &s;hould make of both the objects &s;he had received; yet &s;he was not &s;ufficiently mi&s;tre&s;s of her lady's thoughts to hazard a forward avowal of her conduct in receiving them. When &s;he attend|ed Lady Jane in the morning, &s;he could not a|void perceiving that &s;he had been in tears; and &s;he pre&s;umed to enquire with evident &s;ymp|toms of affection, <HI>if her lady&s;hip was unwell?</HI> At this unexpected que&s;tion, Lady Jane gave vent to her full heart, and &s;trove not to con|ceal her emotion. She imprudently leaned on her woman's bo&s;om, and, in apparent agony, a&s;ked whether the gentlemen were gone, and if &s;he had &s;een them? Mrs. Drapery told her that they were; and that &s;he had attended them according to her lady&s;hip's order. She drew by degrees the letter out of her pocket, and entreated her lady&s;hip's pardon for the liberty &s;he took in offering it to her peru&s;al. She a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he had no time to return it after it had been put into her hands; and that pity for the poor young gentleman's &s;or|row at his departure had afterwards induced her to &s;ecrete it, until &s;he might &s;ee him a+gain.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="030497_0025_0FE6F57FAAD437D8">Lady Jane took the letter with &s;eeming re|luctance, and found it to contain the following words:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Be not offended, Madam, at the pre&s;ump|tion of a &s;tranger, who till he &s;aw you, never dreamt of love. His profound re&s;pect for your name and character will condemn him to mi&s;ery and future &s;ilence; and he would not have hazarded this liberty, had he not read in your eyes an expre&s;&s;ion of ten|derne&s;s which they have too &s;urely, and probably too fatally, conveyed to the de&s;|ponding heart of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>EDWARD GLENCAIRN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Lady Jane trembled as &s;he read the letter, which &s;he immediately conveyed into her pock|et, and Mrs. Drapery delighted in the &s;ucce&s;s of her undertaking; for although &s;he felt that cu&s;tom, and the laws of decency, would re|quire that &s;he &s;hould maintain her place as a &s;ervile dependant, &s;he from this moment con&s;i|dered her&s;elf the bo&s;om friend of her lady; and exulting in what had pa&s;&s;ed, began to &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf the appointed and convenient confidante of every future action of her life.</P>
<P>From this unhappy period, &s;he began to ex|ert the influence &s;he had obtained over the mind of her hitherto &s;potle&s;s lady; and avail|ing her&s;elf of anadvantage common to low minds, did not fail NOW AND THEN to remind her, by a gentle hint, that &s;he was in her power. Lady Jane's youth, and ignorance of the world, induced her to be &s;ilent where &s;he might have been allowed to complain; but
<PB N="27" REF="030497_0026_0FE6F588A5091828">
her timid &s;oul as apprehen&s;ive of the injurious con&s;truction her hu&s;band might put on the ad|venture, and &s;he re&s;olved to &s;uffer in &s;ilence. She had no wi&s;h. no intention to deceive him; yet &s;he &s;ighed as &s;he reflected on the merits of Glencairn, whom &s;he de&s;paired of &s;eeing more.</P>
<P>We will now return to our mariners. They had a tedious and rather perilous pa&s;&s;age to London, where they landed in three weeks. Colonel Stuart's fir&s;t care was to di&s;patch a me&s;&s;enger to a mercantile hou&s;e in the city, whether his letters were addre&s;&s;ed. He re|ceived one from Mi&s;s Stuart, earne&s;tly reque&s;t|ing him to go to her. She informed him that her health had been for &s;ome months gradually declining; but that &s;he had hitherto avoided mentioning that circum&s;tance to him, waiting till &s;he heard of his arrival in London; alledg|ing, that &s;he was &s;ufficiently acquainted with his feelings, to be convinced that had he known her &s;ituation &s;ooner, he would have ha&s;tened his journey from Scotland, probably to the prejudice both of his health and conven|ience.</P>
<P>Colonel Stuart had not &s;een his daughter &s;ince her mother's death, as &s;he had been near four years at Calais. He &s;poke of her &s;eldom; but his thoughts often dwelt with rapture on the idea of once more folding his trea&s;ure to his heart, and retracing in her growing fea|tures the re&s;emblance of his lo&s;t and lamented wife! Alas! what were the &s;en&s;ations he ex|perienced
<PB N="28" REF="030497_0027_0FE6F588A8F4E8B8">
at the peru&s;al of her fatal letter! It was a deep &s;tub to his wounded mind, and it became nece&s;&s;ary for him to call religion and rea&s;on to his aid, to prevent him from immedi|ately &s;inking under the weight of it.</P>
<P>All that friend&s;hip could &s;ugge&s;t&mdash;all that the mo&s;t tender &s;ympathy could invent, were on this trying occa&s;ion warmly exerted by the amiable Glencairn towards his unhappy friend. He urged the po&s;&s;ibility of Mi&s;s Stuart's being too ea&s;ily alarmed about her&s;elf; that the me|lancholy in&s;eparable from a mona&s;tic life had probably induced her to give way to ideas which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> their principle origin from her &s;eclu&s;i|on;&mdash;that the mo&s;t effectual means to be em|ployed towards promoting her recovery, were to amu&s;e her mind; which had &s;carcely began to unfold it&s;elf, ere the event of her mother's death, and her father's &s;ub&s;equent corre&s;pon|dence, &s;tamped an impre&s;&s;ion on it, that time, and a more &s;uitable way of life, would be (in <HI>his</HI> opinion) alone capable to efface.</P>
<P>The voice of con&s;olation in&s;en&s;ibly gained upon the Colonel; his misfortunes grew ligh|ter as he li&s;tened to the advice of his friend; his heart in a few hours recovered in &s;ome mea&s;ure its former &s;erenity; and in&s;tead of wa&s;ting time in deploring the evil that threat|ened him, he endeavoured to avert it by ha&s;t|ening to join and cheri&s;h her, who, &s;ince the death of his wife, &s;eemed doubly entitled to his care and protection.</P>

<P>NOTHING material occurred during their journey to Calais; but Glencairn, to whom every object was new, was &s;urpri&s;ed at the different &s;cenes that pre&s;ented them&s;elves. Often, however, did his imagination retrace the image of Lady Jane Martindale; &s;he was the fir&s;t woman he had ever beheld with emo|tion, and her expre&s;&s;ive looks had taught him to believe that he was not indifferent to her. He lamented both the cau&s;e and its effect, that had, by preventing their continuing in Lon|don, deprived him of being pre&s;ented at the Duche&s;s of G&mdash;'s, where he could ob|tain the only chance of the Colonel's hearing of, or &s;eeing Mr. Martindale. But the&s;e reflec|tions he was obliged to conceal; they remain|ed with his &s;ecret buried in his heart- and he was under too many obligations to the Colonel not to endeavour (at lea&s;t) to &s;uppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>When they landed at Calais, and had reach|ed Mon&s;iur De&s;&s;in's hotel there, Colonel Stu|art found him&s;elf fatigued and agitated by his journey. He reque&s;ted Glencairn to go immediately to the convent, with a note from him to the &s;uperior, de&s;iring her to &s;end Mi&s;s Stuart, with the bearer, his friend. Glen|cairn had formerly &s;een her; but it was dur|ing
<PB N="30" REF="030497_0029_0FE6F589EA2F7BF8">
tho&s;e days of infancy on either &s;ide, that had left but few traces behind them. He de|livered his letter at the gate of the convent, and was conducted to the parlour, on one &s;ide of which, was a large grate; and on the other &s;ide, a curtain that was drawn. In a few minutes it was removed, and pre|&s;ented to his view a form that nature had tak|en pride in adorning.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Stuart (for it was her&s;elf) was the mo&s;t fini&s;hed picture of human perfection. She rai&s;ed her blue eyes as he addre&s;&s;ed her, and politely reque&s;ting him to wait a few minutes, di&s;appeared to put her&s;elf in readine&s;s to ac|company him.</P>
<P>She &s;oon rejoined him in the parlour, and they proceeded on foot to the hotel. She ac|cepted his arm, and he perceived with ex|treme &s;orrow that &s;he had &s;carcely &s;ufficient &s;trength to proceed. Yet &s;he did not once complain, but pa&s;&s;ed the &s;hort time in making a thou&s;and tender enquiries about her father.</P>
<P>The meeting between them was highly af|fecting; they were equally &s;en&s;ible of the changes each other's looks had experienced, yet neither dared to acknowledge that they perceived any alteration. It was but too evi|dent that Mi&s;s Stuart was in the early &s;tage of a con&s;umption, which appeared to be fa&s;t ha&s;t|ening this beauteous blo&s;&s;om to a premature decay. It was &s;oon determined that &s;he &s;hould immediately leave the convent; that the next morning her expences &s;hould be paid there;
<PB N="31" REF="030497_0030_0FE6F59410556198">
and her clothes taken away; and that they &s;hould allow them&s;elves a few days repo&s;e at Calais, before they fixed on any plan their inclinations might for the pre&s;ent lead them to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Stuart had contracted an intimacy in the convent with a Mi&s;s Beaumont, a young lady of French extraction, and &s;omewhat old|er than her&s;elf. The very &s;lender fortune &s;he was to inherit, had induced her parents to per|&s;uade her to take the veil, to which &s;he was perfectly reconciled. Having lived in the con|vent &s;ince &s;he was &s;ix years old, &s;he had not a wi&s;h to &s;ee the world, but had partly re&s;olved to enter on her noviciate the following year.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Stuart called there the next morning, and took leave of her friend. They agreed to corre&s;pond during the remainder of their lives, and that no intere&s;ting circum&s;tance &s;hould oc|cur to the one, with which the other &s;hould not become acquainted.</P>
<P>Our travellers had been near a week at Calais, and Colonel Stuart thought it time to fix their departure. But whither were they to go? He wi&s;hed, for his own gratification, to return home; but he thought it would be, at that time, a wrong mea&s;ure to adopt on his daughter's account. For this he had a double motive: Winter was &s;etting in, and he na|turally conceived that the keen bla&s;ts of the North would have too powerful an influence over her delicate and affected frame. He feared
<PB N="32" REF="030497_0031_0FE6F5941432BB08">
al&s;o, from the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility he preceived her to po&s;&s;e&s;s, that &s;he might receive a fatal blow to her peace, when, on her return to her fir&s;t home, every object which appeared there would remind her of its lo&s;t ornament, her mother!&mdash;The Colonel had, &s;ince her death, found a melancholy plea&s;ure in arrang|ing every thing at Allan-Bank for her reception. All that had belonged to Mrs. Suart, he had collected carefully for her daughter; but he had no idea of the faded form he was to meet; he had &s;een her a healthy, though delicate girl; and he naturally expected to find in her im|proved under&s;tanding, and formerly lively di&s;|po&s;ition, the companion be&s;t &s;uited to &s;ooth the angui&s;h of his mind, whenever he reflected on the virtues of that incomparable wife of which the grave had robbed him!</P>
<P>In the evening, when Mi&s;s Stuart had retired to her appartment, the Colonel rang for ano-bottle of Mon&s;ieur De&s;&s;in's be&s;t Burgundy, and imparted to Glencairn his reflections of the day. He ob&s;erved, that having nothing to con&s;ult but their re&s;pective inclinations, he had en|tertained an idea of their traveling South; that he thought his beloved Mary's health required change of air, and he conceived it po&s;&s;ible THAT of Italy might re&s;tore it. She would al&s;o derive many advantages from &s;uch a TOUR, that were not to be met with in Scotland. It would afford her a fine-opportunity of improv|ing her&s;elf in mu&s;ic, of which &s;he was pa&s;&s;ion|ately fond; and &s;he would by travelling gain a &s;ufficient knowledge of the world, to conquer
<PB N="33" REF="030497_0032_0FE6F5954FDC6CC0">
that awkward ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which gave her a childi&s;h air of &s;implicity, and which it would be nece&s;&s;ary for her to overcome before &s;he pre|&s;ided at his hou&s;e, of which, alas! &s;he was now become &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s. Glencairn could not with any propriety appear to di&s;approve this &s;cheme, and nothing remained but to ob|tain Mi&s;s Stuart's approbation (of which they could have no doubt); and that obtained, they re&s;olved to quit Calais, and pa&s;s through Pro|vence to Nice.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Stuart was, as they expected, plea&s;ed with the propo&s;al; and nothing was wanting to complete the &s;atisfaction of the party, but a more cheerful acquie&s;cence on the part of Glen|cairn, who vainly endeavoured to forget his predilection for Lady Jane Martindale. He experienced an inquietude hitherto unknown to him, when he reflected on the impo&s;&s;ibility there now was of his communicating to her his &s;entiments, and the knowledge of his &s;ituation. He dared not hazard writing to her by the po&s;t; and though the &s;ailors had told him Mrs. Drapery's name, his re&s;pect and delicacy forbade his addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to her. He was forced therefore for the pre&s;ent to relinqui&s;h all hope of &s;eeing, hearing of, or writing to her; and he felt the force of Rochefoucault's ju&s;t ob|&s;ervation, that
<Q>Ab&s;ence le&s;&s;ens &s;mall pa&s;&s;ions, and encrea&s;es great ones.</Q>

They were attended only by a French &s;ervant who had travelled all his life, &s;poke a little Engli&s;h, and whom De&s;&s;in had recom|mended.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over every natural incident that occurred to them, and ob&s;erve only that they reached Nice &s;oon after the time they had calcu|lated to do &s;o; when, after pa&s;&s;ing a few days at the hotel, they hired by the month an ele|gant villa in its environs.</P>
<P>The Colonel had procured letters of credit on the Engli&s;h banker there, and they were all alike charmed with their new &s;ituation. Their &s;ervant Louis had been there frequently, and was become their <HI>Proveditore-Generale.</HI> Mi&s;s Stuart hired a maid for her&s;elf, by name Jo&s;ephine, which, with an Italian cook, com|pleated their family.</P>
<P>Colonel Stuart was an independent, though
<PB N="35" REF="030497_0034_0FE6F59E4CFEFB08">
not a rich man. His income had never been involved, and it produced him from five to &s;ix hundred pounds a year. He had no one to pro|vide for but his daughter.</P>
<P>With his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Glencairn it was otherwi&s;e, He was an orphan, without a friend in the world but the Colonel, who (having been ma|ny years intimate with his decea&s;ed father, di&s;|tantly related to Mrs. Stuart, and who was a younger brother of high birth, who&s;e fortune peri&s;hed with his life) had adopted this <HI>child of love,</HI> and promi&s;ed never to de&s;ert him. He adhered to his word, and was &s;ufficiently pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of his young ward, to WISH that a future attachment might take place be|tween him and his daughter, that his fortune might by their marriage equally devolve on both. With this view, he had &s;pared no pains to cultivate the mind of the young Edward, who repaid his tender care with all that filial duty and &s;incere affection could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>It was with this young couple, as with all our untravelled i&s;landers, who&s;e extent of E|uropean knowledge carries them no father than the boundaries of England; every object be|yond Dover becoming a matter of wonder. Thus it was with our North Britons. Mi&s;s Stuart and Glencairn were lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment at every new &s;cene which pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their view, and they &s;eemed to fancy them&s;elves in|habitants of another world. They were left almo&s;t entirely to them&s;elves; for Colonel Stu|art was a man of &s;uch &s;trict honour, and had
<PB N="36" REF="030497_0035_0FE6F59E50DB46F0">
withal &s;o much family-pride, that he believed it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould derogate from either: his only apprehen&s;ion was, that neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed &s;ufficient confidence to explain tho&s;e mutual &s;entiments which he thought mu&s;t be in&s;epara|ble from both. In this opinion he was not al|together mi&s;taken. Their time pa&s;&s;ed away in innocent delight; and Mi&s;s Stuart's health be|ginning vi&s;ibly to mend, they amu&s;ed them|&s;elves in vi&s;iting every curio&s;ity, with which the charming country they were now become inhabitants of, abounded.</P>
<P>To the vicinity of Nice, innumerable were the picture&s;que &s;cenes which met their ravi&s;h|ed eyes. How beautiful do the maritime Alps appear, as they ri&s;e from the ocean! from whence a&s;cending by gentle degrees, they form a &s;uperb amphitheatre, bounded by Mount|albano, projecting into the &s;ea, and over hang|ing the town. On the other &s;ide, where pro|&s;pects le&s;s &s;tupendous allure the eye, how charming do the richly cultivated plains ap|pear, while they pre&s;ent to the view the vines, the citrons, the oranges, the bergamots, and every luxury which Earth can furni&s;h to her inhabitants!&mdash;The gardens, which are during the winter months equally profu&s;e of the &s;weete&s;t flowers, convinced them, that in that terre&s;trial paradi&s;e the Lord of all had been peculiarly bounteous, and that to be happy it was nece&s;&s;ary only to forget every disappoint|ment that had hitherto awaited them in this &s;ublunary world.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="030497_0036_0FE6F59F61398228">But how vain is every endeavour to com|mand the feelings of the human heart!&mdash;They ri&s;e &s;uperior to controul, and if they reign at all, they reign with tyranny. Glencairn mu&s;t have been more than mortal, le&s;s than man, could he have re&s;ided under the &s;ame roof with the all fa&s;cinating Mary, without feeling the power of her improving charms. He was not blind to them, but often in &s;ecre|cy lamented his way ward de&s;tiny, which &s;eem|ed determined in &s;pite of every oppo&s;ition to &s;eparate them through life. An idea, prior to his &s;eeing Mary, had taken full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him. He had beheld Lady Jane Martindale, and his heart had vowed to her everla&s;ting love. He even cheri&s;hed the certainty of her hu&s;band's not being IMMORTAL; and he con|ceived it po&s;&s;ible for a time to arrive, nay, he even believd it to be not far di&s;tant, when he might return to England, and claim her as his own.</P>
<P>How vi&s;ionary is every &s;cheme of future bli&s;s, and how precarious are the wi&s;hes of man!&mdash;He builds his hope on a &s;hadow; and &s;carcely has he time to admire the fabric his imagination has rai&s;ed, ere it vani&s;hes, and his dream of happine&s;s at once di&s;appears!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<P>WE will now return to Led&s;tone, where nothing material occured during the &s;ummer and autumn months, more than has been mentioned. Lady Jane and Mr. Mar|tindale lived peaceably together, &s;eldom con|tradicting each other, but particularly agree|ing on one point, that of looking forward with plea&s;ure to the de&s;tined time of their re|turn to London. Lady Jane &s;ometimes, in|deed, recollected Glencairn; but tho&s;e emoti|ons &s;he had experienced at fir&s;t &s;eeing him, had &s;ub&s;ided into a languid indifference, and her thoughts became every day more devoted to the idea of the plea&s;ures &s;he &s;hould enjoy in the gay metropolis. She did not however ne|glect at times vi&s;iting her favourite &s;pot; but it was now winter, and the coldne&s;s of the weather prevented her &s;itting there as former|ly, watching the bo&s;om of the deep.</P>
<P>She was one morning returning from it, and near the hou&s;e, when &s;he perceived Mr. Martindale coming towards her with a letter in his hand. His countenance bore the vi&s;ible marks of di&s;content. He took her arm within his; and &s;lightly ob&s;erving that he had &s;ome|thing unplea&s;ant to communicate, but without mentioning of what nature, they proceeded to the library, where, without hi&s;itation&punc; he
<PB N="39" REF="030497_0038_0FE6F5A75D2939A8">
read to her the letter. It was from his father. It fir&s;t contained a few vague enquiries after them, and then informed them, that being at length tired of a &s;ingle life, he had re&s;olved to marry a &s;econd time. He had partly, he &s;aid, fixed his choice. The Lady (he ob&s;erved) was not of a di&s;tingui&s;hed family, neither did &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s a brilliant fortune; but &s;he had ma|ny good qualities, and he had no doubt of the approbation &s;he would meet with from his &s;on and daughter, to whom he hoped in a few months to introduce her as his wife. He nei|ther mentioned her name, her age, nor her per&s;on; and of the&s;e, various were the opini|ons they entertained. Mr. Martindale highly re&s;pected his father, and dreaded &s;eeing him the dupe of what he naturally &s;uppo&s;ed to be (from the caution ob&s;erved in the letter) an indi&s;creet engagement. Another motive too, and in &s;ome brea&s;ts it would have been a more powerful one than it was in that of Mr. Mar|tindale, was <HI>&s;elf-intere&s;t.</HI> The old gentleman had, on the death of his wife, &s;ettled all his landed property on his &s;on; but he had a great deal of ready money; five thou&s;and pounds of which he had given him on his marriage, be|&s;ides his mother's jointure of two thou&s;and pounds a year, which was, in ca&s;e of Lady Jane's &s;urviving him, to be her portion for life. He had been indeed particularly liberal on that occa&s;ion, having pre&s;ented Lady Jane with the late Mrs. Martindale's jewels, which were of con&s;iderable value, and he had pur|cha&s;ed every thing for them, &s;uch as equipa|ges, plate, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="030497_0039_0FE6F5A76119A9D0">It was impo&s;&s;ible they could fore&s;ee with plea&s;ure an union which would divide, if it did not wholly alienate, the affections of Mr. Mar|tindale from his family. After they had con|&s;ulted together for &s;ome time on the &s;ubject, they agreed to &s;et out for London with all convenient expedition. Mr. Martindale an|&s;wered his father's letter, but in terms almo&s;t as equivocal as his own. He expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at the half confidence repo&s;ed in him, and concluded by wi&s;hing him every happine&s;s in whatever &s;ituation he might hereafter find <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; but he did not give the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of his intention of going to town, which was in hopes, if it were not already too late, to fru&s;trate the old gentleman's pre&s;ent intenti|ons.</P>
<P>As they had no hou&s;e there, they were on their arrival obliged to put up at an hotel; and had on that account left all their &s;ervants, ex|cepting Mrs. Drapery and the butler, at Led|&s;tone. They had not been there many minu|tes, before Mr. Martindale &s;ent for a hackney|coach, and went to his father's hou&s;e in the city. But how great was his a&s;toni&s;hment, when, on knocking at the door, a footman in an unknown livery appeared at it, and inform|med him, that the hou&s;e was now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another family; Mr. Martindale having been married about a month, and that he re&s;i|ded in Devon&s;hire Place!</P>
<P>Mr. Martindale &s;mothered as much as po&s;&s;i|ble his indignation and &s;urpri&s;e. He directed
<PB N="41" REF="030497_0040_0FE6F5AA5889B530">
the coachman to return to the hotel, and gave him&s;elf up to his reflections in this fir&s;t in&s;tance of duplicity on his father; for it was evident to him, that he was actually married at the time he wrote to him; and that the ceremony mu&s;t have been performed in a very private manner, not a &s;ingle news-paper having announced it.</P>
<P>When he returned to Lady Jane, and in|formed her what had pa&s;&s;ed, he had the &s;ati&s;|faction to find that her feelings were perfectly congenial with his own: &s;he per&s;uaded him to wait till the next day for farther intelligence; and amid&s;t a thou&s;and conjectures&mdash;apprehen&s;i|ons&mdash;and uncertainties&mdash;they pa&s;&s;ed the even|ing, and retired early to re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>MR. James Martindale, at a &s;ea&s;onable hour, di&s;patched his own &s;ervant with a dutiful, yet cool billet of congratulation to his father, reque&s;ting to know at what, hour he might be premitted to wait on him.</P>
<P>Though it was but ju&s;t two o'clock when the valet was &s;ent on his errand, he found the crowd of &s;ervants and carriages &s;o great at Mr. Martindale's door, that it had more the appear|ance
<PB N="42" REF="030497_0041_0FE6F5AA5DB83EF0">
of the Exhibition at Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e, than of belonding to a citizen.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome minutes before he could prevail on one of the footmen to carry up the note he was intru&s;ted with. After waiting a con&s;idera|ble time for an an&s;wer, a verbal one was brought him by another powdered coxcomb, which was &s;imply Mr. Martindale's compli|ments, and that he would call at the hotel within an hour. Lady Jane was &s;tanding at one of the windows of it about four o'clock, when a &s;umptuous vis-a-vis &s;topped at the door. Mr. Martindale was &s;itting by the fire-&s;ide, reading a new pamphlet, when Lady Jane's precipitate exclamation, of "Good "God! this cannot be your father!" in&s;tantly drew him towards her. They thought they recog|nized his features, though di&s;gui&s;ed under a &s;mall wig, made to look like his own hair; which gave &s;o great an alteration to his coun|tenance, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them at the fir&s;t moment to a&s;certain whether or no it was really him they &s;aw. They were however &s;oon convinced, as he hobbled out of his carri|age &s;upported by two &s;ervants in yellow and &s;ilver liveries: the plain blue and buff, which had been the family &s;tandard of many years, was to all appearance di&s;carded, with the brown bob of former and more re&s;pectable days.</P>
<P>Mr. Martindale received the congratulations of his &s;on and daughter with much &s;eeming plea|&s;ure; and apologized with rather a di&s;concert|ed air for the &s;ecrecy he had ob&s;erved towards
<PB N="43" REF="030497_0042_0FE6F5B52B9637E8">
them; alledging as his rea&s;on for it, the ap|prehen&s;ions he had entertained for their di&s;ap|proveing his marriage; to which however he was very certain no rea&s;onable objection could be &s;tated, unle&s;s it was that of a di&s;parity of years; Mrs. Martindale being extreamly young, and extreamly hand&s;ome. He was commi&s;&s;ioned by her, he &s;aid, to &s;ay a thou&s;and kind things to them both; and to a&s;&s;ure them of her regret at finding her&s;elf engaged not only for that day, but for the &s;ucceeding one; but &s;he hoped they would not refu&s;e her the favour of their company to &s;upper that night at twelve, after the opera, where &s;he was going. To this they a&s;&s;ented, more from curio&s;ity than inclination, and the old bridegroom took his leave.</P>
<P>Mr. Martindale, in going down the &s;tair|ca&s;e with his father, enquired the former name of his mother-in-law; but received a very laconic an&s;wer, that it was <HI>Harvey;</HI> of a fami|ly of the North of England, with which he could not po&s;&s;ibly be acquainted.</P>
<P>He returned, and &s;at down in &s;ullen &s;ilence; but Lady Jane laughed. She had no envy in her compo&s;ition, and was prepared to admire the &s;uperior beauties of Mrs. Martindale, with|out a wi&s;h to outvie them, or to find them any way inferior to the old gentleman's di&s;|cription.</P>
<P>At the appointed hour they went to De|von&s;hire-Place. Mrs. Martindale was but ju&s;t
<PB N="44" REF="030497_0043_0FE6F5B52F722DE0">
returned home, having lounged, &s;he &s;aid, long|er than &s;he intended in the &s;aloon of the opera-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>If her vi&s;itors were &s;truck with the beauty of her per&s;on (than which nothing could be more captivating), they were not le&s;s &s;o with the dazzling &s;plendour of her dre&s;s, A rich gold mu&s;lin, made into a Circa&s;&s;ian robe, with a turban of white crape, ornamented with a profu&s;ion of diamonds, gave her the appear|ance of an ea&s;tern prince&s;s; but there was an air of levity in her manner, that in&s;tantly caught the attention of young Mr. Martindale; who had &s;carcely beheld her, ere his heart formed a wi&s;h that no violent intimacy might in future take place between her and his wife.</P>
<P>The more he &s;aw of this youthful bride (who&s;e appearance did not be&s;peak her age to be more than &s;eventeen), the le&s;s he liked her; and while he drew her into a conver&s;ation, in which he perceived that her ignorance and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency were predominant, he plea&s;ed him&s;elf on the compari&s;on he could not avoid making between her, and the le&s;s beautiful, but more lovely and unadorned Lady Jane; who having, &s;ince the &s;mall portion of know|ledge &s;he had obtained of her heart, lo&s;t a con|&s;iderable &s;hare of that pride which had ever been her greate&s;t foible, was become infinitely more intere&s;ting to &s;ociety, and more amiable in the eyes of her hu&s;band. In HER was blend|ed all that increa&s;ing &s;en&s;ibility could be&s;tow on an intelligent mind. Polite without flatte|ry,
<PB N="45" REF="030497_0044_0FE6F5B6A91F2150">
&s;he every day gained on the e&s;teem of tho&s;e who knew her. Mrs. Martindale, by endea|vouring to appear the woman of fa&s;hion, for which &s;he was never intended, was at times e|ven vulgar; and her ob&s;cure origin was not counterbalanced by the graces of her mind. Nature had been, it is true, profu&s;ely lavi&s;h on her per&s;on; but her di&s;po&s;ition was avaricious and mean. She di&s;liked Lady Jane's &s;uperior birth, but &s;he had cunning to di&s;&s;emble; and endeavoured to flatter her into a belief, that &s;he had never &s;een any woman with whom &s;he &s;o much longed to cultivate a friend&s;hip, as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>We will now take leave of this family party for the night; they parted, not without a vo|luntary offer from Mrs, Martindale to break off all acquaintance with tho&s;e of her &s;ociety whom Lady Jane might not approve. I will next inform my readers who was Mrs. Martin|dale; which, together with the little &s;ketch I have drawn of her di&s;po&s;ition, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure enable them to account for the tenor of her future conduct; at lea&s;t, if they think as I do, that a low mind never attains any degree of excellence, however the per&s;on may be ex|alted. The heart when <HI>good</HI> is incorruptible, however the mind may be overuled by the force of cu&s;tom and of example: but when both the&s;e are bad, the &s;tain is indelible, and can never be expunged.</P>

<P>MRS. Martindale was one of the many children of a re&s;pectable trade&s;man in Newca&s;tle, and on a vi&s;it to her elder &s;i&s;ter, married to a corn-factor in the city, when Mr. Martindale fir&s;t &s;aw her. He &s;oon became en|amoured; for his heart was not &s;ufficiently fro|zen by age to be able to with&s;tand the reno|vating <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of youth and beauty. The idea, however, of marrying her, or any other woman, did not once occur to him. The &s;i&s;ter, who was artful and de&s;igning, perceived his inclinations, and determined to turn his weak|ne&s;s to the advantage of her family. She invit|ed, or rather forced him into all their parties; and finding, after a few weeks, that he did not make any overtures towards her &s;i&s;ter's e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, &s;he told him with much apparent concern, that &s;he found her &s;i&s;ter's character had &s;uffered materially from his con&s;tant atten|dance on her; that &s;he had lo&s;t by it a very eli|gible marriage; the gentleman (who was a young officer) having withdrawn his addre&s;&s;es in con&s;equence of it, and that it was become nece&s;&s;ary for him to di&s;clo&s;e his intentions, of whatever nature they might be.</P>
<P>This was a trial for which the old gentleman
<PB N="47" REF="030497_0046_0FE6F5C1DA4D7988">
was not prepared. He he&s;itated, as undeter|mined what to an&s;wer; till on being told that there was no alternative between his marrying Mi&s;s Harvey, or &s;eeing her no more, he was weak enough to wipe the tears from his eyes, and in half-broken &s;entences, extorted by FEAR, as well as LOVE, he promi&s;ed to offer her his hand. In le&s;s than half an hour he had con|&s;ented to fall into the &s;nare that was laid for him. The family de&s;ired the engagement might be kept &s;ecret, in order to avoid, they &s;aid, the ill-natured &s;arca&s;ms and reflections the world would ca&s;t upon his age: but the truth was, they dreaded the advice of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his REAL FRIENDS, and hurried him into <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> of ha&s;ty marriage, without allowing him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to con&s;ider what he had to expect <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Having been thus prevailed on without dif|ficulty, he thought of nothing but his intended bride. He was profu&s;e in his pre&s;ents to her; and on her mentioning; that &s;he thought the ci|ty air inimical to her health, he di&s;patched an agent, of her &s;i&s;ter's recommending, in pur&s;uit of a hou&s;e at the we&s;t end of the town. This tru&s;ty and well-cho&s;en amba&s;&s;ador made choice of the one in Devon&s;hire-Place&punc; and &s;o exactly did he an&s;wer the confidence repo&s;ed in him, that he actually made, in Mr. Martindale's name, an agreement for the purcha&s;e of it; &s;o that no farther trouble was impo&s;ed on the old gentleman, than to &s;ign the bonds which were two days afterwards put into his hands. It is true that he ONCE accompanied the ladies to
<PB N="48" REF="030497_0047_0FE6F5C1DE2F9D88">
look at it; but was there a fault that he could po&s;&s;ibly find with a hou&s;e fit for the reception of any nobleman's family? Could any hou&s;e be too good for Mi&s;s Harvey? Could any ex|penditure that lay within the compa&s;s of Mr. Martindale's drafts, be extravagant?</P>
<P>The furniture of his hou&s;e in the city was to be the next con&s;ideration. There was not e|nough of it, neither was it &s;ufficiently modern to be tran&s;planted into Devon&s;hire Place. The mo&s;t fa&s;hionable uphol&s;terer in town was there|fore immediately applied to, and directed to change it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his fancy directed. He was to be allowed one thou&s;and pounds, over and above the value of what he took from the city; and of which he, as the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable, and con|&s;equently the mo&s;t con&s;cientious trade&s;man, was to be &s;ole apprai&s;er. That furniture was not, as I ob&s;erved, &s;uited to the pre&s;ent ta&s;te, but it was co&s;tly in the extreme; and was e|qually good, though not equally ornamental, in the inferior as in the be&s;t apartments. The late Mrs. Martindale's dre&s;&s;ing-room was fitted up in the mo&s;t expen&s;ive manner; innumera|ble were the rich ornaments it contained; the beautiful inlaid and Indian cabinets, the tall mandarians, and fine China jars, were not the mo&s;t remarkable. The boxes belonging to her toilette were, like tho&s;e of the rich, but nar|row-minded Lady S&mdash;, of &s;ilver inlaid with rubies; the bird-cages were of &s;ilver wire, and every article di&s;played <HI>grandeur,</HI> if not (according to modern ideas <HI>elegance.</HI> Some of the&s;e Mi&s;s Harvey wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve; till a
<PB N="49" REF="030497_0048_0FE6F5C30FA9C018">
gentle hint from her &s;i&s;ter reminded her, that as they had been the property of the late Mrs. Martindale, who had doubtle&s;s &s;et a value on them beyond their intrin&s;ic worth, it was pro|bable that, if they were in <HI>her</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, her &s;on might wi&s;h to obtain them for Lady Jane to keep in remembrance of her. Nothing therefore was to be given into his hands, but a large portrait of his mother, with which he was to be favoured on his return to town; Mi&s;s Harvey MODESTLY ob&s;erving, that, con&s;cious of her own unworthine&s;s, &s;he &s;hould fear a ri|val in that picture whenever Mr. Martindale looked at it, as he would naturally draw a com|pari&s;on between his two wives, which could not fail to be an unfortunate one to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e was &s;oon ready; the jewels, wed|ding clothes, and equipages, &s;oon bought; and nothing remained but to fix the happy day, which &s;oon arrived. But the one previous to It was marked by a little event, which it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary to mention in the next chap|ter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XIII.</HEAD>
<P>ON the morning preceding the day that was to make Mr. Martindale the happi|e&s;t or mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men, he perceived that an unu&s;ual gloom over&s;pread the fine coun|tenance of his de&s;tined bride. He pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his lips, and entreated to be informed of the cau&s;e. She bur&s;t into tears, and &s;ud|denly withdrew, leaving him and her &s;i&s;ter together.</P>
<P>From HER, he anxiou&s;ly prayed to know the meaning of &s;o &s;udden, &s;o alarming a chan|ge; tenderly enquiring if he had left any thing undone by which it was po&s;&s;ible for him to prove &s;till farther the extent of his affection. The emotion too vi&s;ible on every feature of his face, and the eagerne&s;s with which he conjured her to explain in what he had offend|ed, forced at length, from this TENDER rela|tion, the avowal of a conver&s;ation her &s;i&s;ter had held with her; which amounted to no|thing nore than a childi&s;h idea that had en|tered her head; a kind of fear, that if &s;he was wretched enough to &s;urvive Mr. Martindale, his &s;on, unmindful of his father's tenderne&s;s might divert her of all his goodne&s;s had lavi&s;h|ed on her. He might po&s;&s;ibly in the end turn her out of her hou&s;e, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it,

as his heir. It was not (&s;he was very &s;ure) from any mercenary motive that her &s;i&s;ter had encouraged this thought; it was that of a young girl fund of magnificence as a child of a new toy, and like that, fearful of loo&s;ing it. This was a &s;ufficient hint for the too generous and too credulous Mr. Martindale; he &s;ent immedi|ately for his attorney; and gave him in&s;tructi|ons to draw up a marriage &s;ettlement, by which he gave her the hou&s;e in Devon&s;hire Place, with all its appendages; together with all the ready money he &s;hould die po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, &s;tocks, dividends, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. allotting only one thou&s;and pounds of it as a legacy to Mr. Mar|tindale, or Lady Jane if &s;he &s;urvived him; his landed property having been, as I before &s;aid, already &s;ettled on his &s;on.</P>
<P>In a few hours all was &s;igned, &s;ealed, and delivered; and he expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude at be|ing told how to remove the imaginary grief that had for a moment been &s;uffered to prey on HER, to who&s;e happine&s;s he was determined to devote the remainder of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The next morning the &s;un &s;hone re&s;plendent on the nuptials of Mr. Martindale. They were &s;o|lemnized as agreed on in a private manner; and in the evening he conducted his bride to HER OWN hou&s;e in Devon&s;hire Place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Martindale &s;oon gained a complete a&s;cendancy over her doting hu&s;band, which was &s;trengthened by her apparent attach|ment to Lady Jane, who continued to be &s;o great a favourite with him, that her &s;anction &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to every thing &s;he undertook. She had art enough to twi&s;t her&s;elf round the heart of that lady, who repo&s;ed in her an unlimited confidence, and they became in&s;e|parable. They met with univer&s;al admiration; but their manners were &s;o different, that the admirer of the one was &s;eldom that of the o|ther. Mrs. Martindale's beauty and levity attracted the notice of all the gay men, while Lady Jane's increa&s;ing &s;en&s;ibility gave her an air of <HI>froideur,</HI> that forbade them every hope-of encouragement.</P>
<P>Mr. Martindale, &s;enior, though extrava|gant in the gratification of his wife's plea|&s;ures, was not wholly unmindful of his &s;on's intere&s;ts. He purcha&s;ed a &s;mall hou&s;e for him in Argyle Street, to which he was prompted by his wife</P>
<P>Lady Jane believed her to be only the art|le&s;s, giddy girl &s;he appeared. Little did &s;he
<PB N="54" REF="030497_0053_0FE6F5CE1AC10790">
&s;u&s;pect the &s;nake &s;he was fo&s;tering in her bo|&s;om, which waited only with envenomed ran|cour to &s;ting her beyond the reach of human remedies.</P>
<P>Among the crowd of fluctuating admirers that paid their devotions at the &s;hrine of beauty, Lord Darnley was the mo&s;t con&s;picuous for his attentions to Mrs. Martindale. He was lately married to a very young lady, who&s;e large fortune had been in part appropriated to the payment of his lord&s;hip's early debts. He was fond of his wife, yet not &s;ufficiently &s;o to lay any embargo on his inclinations whenever they led him to indulge a momentary caprice.</P>
<P>He con&s;idered Mrs. Martindale an ea&s;y con|que&s;t, which, when once obtained, would be &s;oon forgotten. With this view he laid clo&s;e &s;iege to her at every public place &s;he frequent|ed; nor did &s;he give his lord&s;hip any rea&s;on to doubt the &s;ucce&s;s of his enterpri&s;e. Vanity was her ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and to that &s;he was e|ver ready to &s;acrifice every moral con&s;iderati|on. Lady Jane either did not, or would not perceive this growing intimacy; &s;he conceived Mrs. Martindale's levity to be her be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t any attachment of the heart, and &s;he felt no alarms on her account.</P>
<P>Lord Darnley was rather an elegant than a hand&s;ome man. Perfectly ver&s;ed in every le&s;|&s;on of LOVE, he had &s;eldom met with a denial where he had once taken the pains to ingra|tiate him&s;elf. He was at this time bu&s;ily em|ployed
<PB N="55" REF="030497_0054_0FE6F5D9B52FA578">
in rai&s;ing a regiment of light dragoons for the &s;ervice of his country; and a de&s;ire of rendering him&s;elf con&s;picuous according with his notions of patrioti&s;m, he &s;pared no expence to complete it. Seldom a day pa&s;&s;ed in which his emi&s;&s;aries did not inveigle new victims to &s;atiate the rapacious thir&s;t of ruthle&s;s war! His lord&s;hip, equally a candidate for the fields of Mars and of Venus, divided his time between both. His morning hours were devoted to the mi&s;ery and ruin of many poor and worthy fa|milies; his evening ones to the more plea&s;ing amu&s;ement of endeavouring to &s;educe the af|fections of any woman, to whom he might wi&s;h for the moment to render him&s;elf agreeable. Not that I mean to infer, that Lord Darnley was a bad man, he was only a fa&s;hionable one. Nur&s;ed in the lap of luxury by a mo&s;t indulgent mother, his earlie&s;t wi&s;hes had not been left un|gratified. He had been returned from the continent about two years, where his extrava|gance was &s;o unbounded, that it became nece&s;&s;|ary to recall him; and he had been married, one year, to the amiable lady before mention|ed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Martindale was elated by Lord Darn|ley's attention to her. Her eyes &s;ought him every where, and he perceived it; nor was it long before an opportunity offered, that, in making him ma&s;ter of her per&s;on, bani&s;hed the &s;lender impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made on his mind. He met with little or no re&s;i&s;tance when he hinted at a private a&s;&s;ignation; which being fixed, and effected at the hou&s;e of her conve|nient,
<PB N="56" REF="030497_0055_0FE6F5D9B900E928">
milliner, pa&s;&s;ed without &s;u&s;picion a|mong her attendants.</P>
<P>Lord Darnley was no &s;ooner a happy lover, than he was a &s;atiated one. He had never &s;een any woman but Lady Darnley for whom he had conceived a &s;entiment beyond that of momentary pa&s;&s;ion; and had &s;he not been his wife, it is mo&s;t probable that in her alone, all his inclinations would have centered; but how &s;trange is, it that every thing lo&s;es a por|tion of its value from the moment we have an indi&s;puteable claim on it! The virtuous Lady Darnley, who had not a particle of coquetry in her di&s;po&s;ition, had married the man of her choice, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">or had &s;he a wi&s;h equal to that of plea&s;ing him. We might be led to &s;uppo&s;e from the remark I have ju&s;t made (and from that only), that had he been more &s;teady in his conduct towards her, &s;he might have been more indifferent. She knew that he had er|rors, but &s;he did not know the extent of them; and &s;he fondly hoped, that her unremiting at|tention to his happine&s;s, and con&s;tant properi|ty of conduct, would at length overcome them. She knew Lady Jane, and Mrs. Martindale, by report only; her approaching confinement, which &s;he expected every hour, keeping her con&s;tantly at home, without other &s;ociety than her mother, who was come for the fir&s;t time in her life to London, for the purpo&s;e of attending her at that trying moment.</P>
<P>When the new&s;papers announced Lady Darnley's delivery, Mrs. Martindale plea&s;ed
<PB N="57" REF="030497_0056_0FE6F5DB4726EAD8">
her&s;elf with the idea of monopolizing his lord|&s;hip's con&s;tant attendance; and having menti|oned to her hu&s;band the polite attentions that Lady Jane and her&s;elf had received from him, &s;ignified her intention of &s;ending him a card for the next evening &s;he &s;hould receive company, and of introducing his lord&s;hip to his acquain|tance. To this no objection could be made, and Mrs. Martindale took an early opportunity of di&s;patching invitations to &s;everal of her ac|quaintance, among whom Lord Darnley was not forgotten.</P>
<P>Lady Jane, who had no &s;u&s;picion of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and who really liked Lord Darn|ley, though &s;he had not particularly appeared to do &s;o, was glad of this opportunity of bring|ing Mr. James Martindale acquainted with him al&s;o; and of becoming by the&s;e means known to Lady Darnley, when her confinement &s;hould be over.</P>
<P>Mrs Martindale's a&s;&s;embly was brilliant in the extreme; for &s;he had been very particular on that occa&s;ion, and had her&s;elf &s;elected from her vi&s;iting-book, &s;uch names as &s;tood foremo&s;t in the gaudy catalogue of rank.</P>
<P>At the appointed hour, &s;he &s;aw her rooms fill to her heart's &s;atisfaction, but in vain &s;he looked for Lord Darnley!&mdash;She grew inat|tentive to her vi&s;itors, walked &s;ucce&s;&s;ively thro' the rooms, and looked continually at her watch, which &s;he fancied lo&s;t <HI>time.</HI> &s;he could not account for his ab&s;ence. It was on HIS ac|count
<PB N="58" REF="030497_0057_0FE6F5DB4CDF5D48">
&s;he had that evening a&s;&s;embled all that was mo&s;t fa&s;hionable in town, and had &s;tudied to rai&s;e her con&s;equence by the &s;election of her company; yet he was the only per&s;on who did not appear. At eleven, the party began to di&s;per&s;e; the duche&s;s of G&mdash;and her love|ly daughters were ju&s;t taking their leave, when Lord Darnley was announced.</P>
<P>The &s;udden appearance of the &s;un breaking through the thick clouds of a mi&s;ty morning, could not convey a more genial warmth to the dew-damp traveller, than did the &s;ight of Lord Darnley to Mrs. Martindale; her eyes bright|ened as &s;he led him towards Mr. Martindale, who received him with the utmo&s;t politene&s;s. But the electrical &s;hock of mortification in&s;tant|ly &s;ucceeded, when, in a voice &s;carcely arti|culate, he enquired for Lady Jane. There was an air of &s;orrow and confu&s;ion in his coun|tenance, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for her to mi&s;|con&s;true. Mrs. Martindale had more pride than love; and with a haughty &s;neer turning ha&s;tily from him, &s;he informed his lord&s;hip, that &s;he had la&s;t &s;een Lady Jane at cards in the ad|joining room. He immediately went there. The party had ju&s;t broke up, and &s;he was &s;tand|ing near the door (waiting for Mr. Martindale, who was gone to enquire for the carriage), when Lord Darnley approached her. He took her hand, with a freedom &s;he had never ob|&s;erved in him, and in a faltering voice whi&s;per|ed&mdash;OH LADY JANE, IN YOU I HOPE TO FIND A FRIEND!&mdash;Struck at his appearance, which indicated a &s;en&s;ibility of which &s;he had
<PB N="59" REF="030497_0058_0FE6F5E7AB218100">
not hitherto &s;uppo&s;ed him capable, &s;he eagerly a&s;ked, what could have thus affected him? The tears ru&s;hed into his eyes, and he could only &s;ay "Lady Darnley"&mdash;as Mr. Martindale informed her their carriage was up. She return|ed ha&s;tily to wi&s;h Mrs. Martindale good-night; introduced Mr. James Martindale to Lord Darnley, who handed her into it, and they parted for the night.</P>

<P>LORD Darnley did not return up &s;tairs, but de&s;iring that his &s;ervants might be called, threw him&s;elf into the carriage, and or|dered it home. His heart was affected, and for once he &s;acrificed the rules of politene&s;s to its feelings. When he arrived there, he flew to Lady Darnley's apartment, without having &s;poken to any one; but alas! little did he ex|pect the &s;cene that awaited him; He knocked gently at the door, fearful of di&s;turbing her re|po&s;e: but receiving no an&s;wer, he opened it. The curtains were all undrawn. On one &s;ide of the bed, he &s;aw her mother gra&s;ping her hands; on the other, the nur&s;e was chafing her temple with har &s;horn;&mdash;but &s;he, alas, was gone for ever!&mdash;A moment convinced him of the fatal truth; the next that &s;ucceeded it, de|prived him of his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="030497_0059_0FE6F5E7AF05A4B8">It was on the ninth-day after Lady Darn|ley's delivery of her fir&s;t child. Some unfa|vourable &s;ymptoms had appeared in the morn|ing, but they were not &s;ufficiently &s;o to alarm the phy&s;icians, or nur&s;e, of any immediate dan|ger. Yet a fatal pre&s;entiment had taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lord Darnley from the fir&s;t hour &s;ince her lying-in; and this was &s;trengthened by &s;ome oblique, yet gentle hints that had been given him by the angle of purity her&s;elf; who had unfortunately &s;topped her cariage one morning by accident at the door of Mrs. Mar|tindale's milliner, where &s;he bought &s;ome things, and gave a card, with orders that o|thers &s;hould be &s;ent to her. The officious Frenchwoman told her, that &s;he was &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t be beholden to Lord Darnly, or Mrs. Martindale, for the honour of her lady&s;hips cu&s;tom, as &s;he was that lady's milliner, and had frequently &s;een his lord&s;hip at her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I do not believe that this French milliner (or indeed any other milliner) could plead igno|rance in &s;uch a &s;ituation. She could not &s;up|po&s;e that Lord Darnley (who&s;e name had been mentioned to her by Mrs. Martindale) had met that lady there &s;ecretly, and in a private room, for any good purpo&s;e. No. But the di&s;covery of the intrigue to Lady Darnley might prove in the end beneficial to her, and &s;he was not of a nature to reflect on the delicate feelings of <HI>a woman of honour.</HI> The&s;e, were therefore to be &s;acrificed to her own mercenary and barbarous di&s;po&s;ition; and &s;he planted a thorn in the brea&s;t of that &s;potle&s;s lady; it fe&s;|tered
<PB N="61" REF="030497_0060_0FE6F5E8CFD200C8">
there, and was her companion to the grave.</P>
<P>Lady Darnley had a few days after the birth of her child, which was a daughter, mo&s;t earn|e&s;tly implored her lord to promi&s;e her that he would never neglect this only pledge of their love. She conjured him to cheri&s;h her for her mother's &s;ake; as &s;he had imbibed, &s;he &s;aid a &s;trange idea, that her FIRST child would be al|&s;o her LAST. She gently added (&s;queezing his hand, and convul&s;ed almo&s;t with agony as &s;he &s;poke), that &s;he hoped he would in future point out to her a better example than the Mrs. Martindale whom &s;he had never &s;een, but of whom &s;he had heard MORE than &s;he thought proper to reveal to him, till after her recovery. Lord Darnley with truth declared, that he had never been in Mrs. Martindale's hou&s;e; that he had only formed a &s;light acquaintance with her at different public places; but he did not mention the French milliner, nor any other circum&s;tance that could tend to corroborate their intimacy.</P>
<P>On the day that he received Mrs. Martin|dale's card, he was half inclined to &s;hew it La|dy Darnley; but her weak health and &s;pirits prevented him. Yet he had no ju&s;t ground to &s;u&s;pect her approaching di&s;&s;olution. Her phy|&s;icians had not, as I &s;aid, even hinted at danger and if his mind was painfully awake to the ap|prehen&s;ion of it, he could impute it only to tho&s;e fears which a timid &s;uper&s;tition, and not reality, had induced him to give way to. He
<PB N="62" REF="030497_0061_0FE6F5E8D4430300">
told her that he was engaged to an a&s;&s;embly that evening, but he did not &s;ay where; and his ac|quaintance was &s;o numerous, that without the help of the milliner, or &s;ome of her confede|rates, Lady Darnley could not have &s;u&s;pected it to be at Mrs. Martindale's &s;he however DID &s;u&s;pect it, and received private intelligence of that lady's hou&s;e being open the &s;ame evening, and that Lord Darnley's carriage made one of the number at her door.</P>
<P>When the me&s;&s;enger who was &s;ent to en|quire into the truth of this unwelcome news returned from executing his commi&s;&s;ion, Lady Darnley in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing him; nor could the tender entreaties of her mother prevent her from diving into the truth. Her di&s;order (in|&s;eparable from her &s;ituation) had that day taken a turn, and marked her death as certain; &s;he received the information of it with all the for|titude that a mind already wa&s;ted to heaven could experience. She de&s;ired that Lord Darn|ley might be immediately &s;ent for; and her footman, eager to obey the orders of his much-loved lady, ha&s;tened on the wings of anxiety to meet his lord. But when he reached De|von&s;hire Place, he heard only that he had been there for a very &s;hort time, and was returned. Lord Darnley was at home a few minutes be|fore his &s;ervant; but it was already too late for him to catch the expiring breath of his lovely, his virtuous, his already &s;ainted wife!</P>
<P>His grief became unbounded; he ki&s;&s;ed her pale lips, and invoked the God of Heaven to
<PB N="63" REF="030497_0062_0FE6F5ECD6B8C5C0">
witne&s;s the integrity of his heart!&mdash;He had been guilty of errors, he felt he had, of fatal ones; but little did he imagine what would be their dreadful con&s;equences; for, in the fir&s;t parox&s;yms of phren&s;y, he condemned him&s;elf as being the &s;ole author of her death. He or|dered his little girl to be brought into the room, and ki&s;&s;ed her with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic and fervent affection. He joined her little face to that of her &s;en&s;ele&s;s mother; and pointed out each re&s;embling feature. It was a &s;olemn, an aw|ful &s;cene; and he was at length forced out of the room; his expre&s;&s;ions of grief becoming &s;o violent, as to threaten with injury his own health.</P>
<P>Lord Darnley would not be told, nor &s;uffer him&s;elf to reflect, that an over delicate con&s;ti|tution had &s;oon &s;urrendered it&s;elf to a malady, which was &s;o powerful as to baffle every effort of art. To this was to be imputed Lady Darn|ley's early death. His feeling heart taught him fir&s;t to con&s;ider his own mi&s;conduct; and he alternately upbraided his child, and him&s;elf, as the authors of their irreparable lo&s;s.</P>

<P>MRS. Martindale &s;eldom or ever took up a new&s;paper; and a cold (of which &s;he made the mo&s;t) had confined her for &s;ome days at home; during which &s;he did not &s;ee Lady Jane, who was gone to pa&s;s a week at Oxford, on a vi&s;it to one of Mr. Martindale's brother collegians.</P>
<P>On the evening of their return, they went to Devon&s;hire Place, and &s;taid &s;upper. Mrs. Martindale appointed two o'clock the next day to call on Lady Jane, as they were to go to|gether to be&s;peak dre&s;&s;es for the en&s;uing ma&s;|querade.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Martindale arrived in Argyle Street, &s;he found Lady Jane in tears; who told her that Mr. Martindale was ju&s;t gone out to enquire into the truth of a para|graph they had ob&s;erved in <HI>The World,</HI> which mentioned Lady Darnley's death. They did not however wait his return, but &s;topped into the carriage as &s;oon as it arrived, ordering the coachman to drive &s;lowly towards Cavendi&s;h Square; and to &s;top, if he &s;aw his ma&s;ter.

<PB N="65" REF="030497_0064_0FE6F5F55EBEFCA8">
and followed by many coaches and weeping at|tendants. The footman's enquiries were an|&s;wered by the name of <HI>Lady Darnley.</HI></P>
<P>Lady Jane let down the fore-gla&s;s, and or|dered the coachman to return; but Mrs. Mar|tindale de&s;ired that he might fir&s;t proceed to Donnelly's in Tavi&s;tock Street; having no idea, &s;he &s;aid, of being di&s;appointed of her ma&s;|querade dre&s;s, becau&s;e Lady Darnley (a wo|man whom &s;he had never &s;een) was dead. Lady Jane endeavoured as much as po&s;&s;ible to conceal her grief; fearing to expre&s;s even a &s;entiment of pity, le&s;t it &s;hould be con&s;trued in|to one of love, for a man for whom &s;he had hitherto felt nothing more than a &s;i&s;terly affect|ion: but who&s;e pre&s;ent misfortune was in it|&s;elf &s;ufficient to intere&s;t a heart po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of le&s;s exqui&s;ite feelings than her own.</P>
<P>Mrs. Martindale ordered a Turki&s;h habit. Lady Jane did not order any thing. She &s;hould be contented, &s;he &s;aid, to appear as an humble attendant on the fair Grecian, not having at that time &s;pirits to encounter the wit of the different characters &s;he &s;hould meet with there.</P>
<P>They returned to Argyle Street, and parted at the door. Mr. Martindale was at home, expecting Lady Jane. He perceived her me|lancholy, and enquired its cau&s;e.

Duche&s;s of G&mdash;'s, but &s;he found her&s;elf unequal to it, and was going to &s;end a card of apology. This &s;he did, and they pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the day in a dome&s;tic, but not a very cheerful t&ecirc;te-&aacute;t&ecirc;te.</P>
<P>The next morning, while Mr. Martindale was out, a &s;ervant of Lord Darnley brought a note from him to Lady Jane, reque&s;ting that he might be permitted to wait on her for a few minutes, if &s;he was alone and di&s;engaged. His &s;ituation precluded the po&s;&s;ibility of a denial, had &s;he not even wi&s;hed to &s;ee him. There is an unde&s;cribable plea&s;ure attendant only on minds &s;u&s;ceptible of fine feelings, in li&s;tening to a tale of woe, and &s;ympathizing with the pathetic narrator. Lord Darnley, the happy and the acknowledged admirer of Mrs. Mar|tindale, had not excited in Lady Jane any alarming &s;en&s;ation; but Lord Darnley mi&s;era|ble, and &s;electing HER as a friend in his mis|fortunes, might become a dangerous compani|on.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than half an hour, Lord Darnley was in Argyle Street. Lady Jane gave orders that no per&s;on &s;hould be admitted, and was almo&s;t equally affected with him&s;elf. He took this opportunity to unbo&s;om him&s;elf to her. He &s;aid, that whatever might be the &s;entiments of his heart towards her, he con&s;idered that in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and her own, an avowal of them would be a violation of decency <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to them&s;elves and to the memory of the d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> departed, who was then only on the road <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="67" REF="030497_0066_0FE6F5FE59665990">
her quiet home!&mdash;But the intercour&s;e of friend|&s;hip was not to be prohibited, and he felt THAT of Lady Jane was nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervati|on of his exi&s;tance; which he valued only for the &s;ake of the haple&s;s infant that had &s;urvived its mother. He then lamented in the mo&s;t af|fecting manner the fatal error of a moment, that had tempted him to be&s;tow a thought on the DISSIPATED, the UNPRINCIPLED <HI>Mrs. Martindale!</HI>&mdash;(Here Lady Jane gazed on him with a&s;toni&s;hment.)&mdash;He hoped, he &s;aid, that her generous heart would in&s;truct her to pardon a connection into which he had been inadver|tently drawn, at the &s;ame time that (he could not help owning it) &s;he alone was the object of his re&s;pect and admiration; and that it would teach her to feel for a man who had NOW a claim on her pity, but who had hitherto de&s;er|ved her utmo&s;t contempt. He then told her of the conver&s;ation he had held, with Lady Darnley, &s;oon after her lying-in, and among the number of his confe&s;&s;ions, the French mil|liner was not forgotten.</P>
<P>Lady Jane was too much confu&s;ed by what &s;he had heard, to know in what manner to re|ply to him. She had too high an opinion of his <HI>honour</HI> to doubt his <HI>word</HI>; yet &s;he could not have &s;uppo&s;ed that Mrs. Martindale would have carried her imprudence beyond what &s;he had conceived to be an unmeaning levity. Yet how nece&s;&s;ary did it appear to her at this mo|ment for an entire explanation to take place, when Lord Darnley implored her pardon for having dared to &s;urmi&s;e that &s;he had been the
<PB N="68" REF="030497_0067_0FE6F5FE5D3EA9F0">
confidante of that vile woman; who had not &s;crupled to declare to him, that Lady Jane had admited more than one favoured lover; but that her regard and pity for both Mr. Martin|dales had prevented her hitherto divulging what in the cour&s;e of time could not fail to be publicly known.</P>
<P>Lady Jane could not without the mo&s;t poig|nant emotion here that her fair &s;ame had been traduced; and by the woman too who &s;hould have been the fir&s;t to defend it. How cruel, how de&s;perate was her condition! for, while Lord Darnley was &s;peaking, &s;he recollected having ob&s;erved that &s;everal of her female ac|quaintance had latterly behaved towards her with uncommon re&s;erve&punc; although no one had been friendly enough to intimate in what &s;he had offended. But &s;he had not &s;uffered it at the time to make any great impre&s;&s;ion on her; as &s;he was perfectly con&s;cious of her innocence, and attributed it only to &s;ome trivial cau&s;e, with which &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly hereafter be|come acquainted.</P>
<P>But now &s;he felt mortified indeed! She found that Lord Darnley had been the FIRST per&s;on prejudiced again&s;t her, and &s;he could have wi&s;hed it to be the rever&s;e. In HIS eyes, &s;he wanted to appear perfect She knew not how to exculpate her&s;elf from calumnies &s;o at|rocious, nor how to convince Lord Darnley of the fal&s;ehood of her accu&s;er. She entreated his lord&s;hip to make allowances for the agitati|on into which his di&s;cour&s;e had thrown her, as
<PB N="69" REF="030497_0068_0FE6F5FF9E0DEC88">
an apology for the little &s;he could at that mo|ment urge in her ju&s;tification; &s;he reque&s;ted his advice how to act, and inwardly re&s;olved, let what would be the con&s;equence, to abide by it. She begged he would direct her how to proceed in a matter of &s;uch importance to the peace of the whole family; ob&s;erving that &s;he was too inexperienced to judge for her&s;elf; and that in con&s;equence of the avowal he had made, &s;he conceived him to be the only per&s;on who was able (or who indeed might be willing) to advi&s;e her.</P>
<P>He told her, that he &s;aw no alternative be|tween a &s;eparation taking place among them all, or her eternal &s;ilence on the &s;ubject. He beg|ged for God's &s;ake that &s;he would not expo&s;e her&s;elf to farther in&s;ults and mortifications; but that &s;he would &s;uffer her&s;elf to be wholly advi&s;ed by him, and continue to live as before: at the &s;ame time he exacted a promi&s;e from her, that &s;he would immediately acquaint him by letter, &s;hould any now manoeuvres of Mrs. Martindale's intervene, to render the di&s;cove|ry of her treachery unavoidable.</P>
<P>Lady Jane promi&s;ed faithfully to adhere to all he &s;aid, he then entreated her to honour his little girl &s;ometimes with her attention. He was going he &s;aid to let his hou&s;e in Cavendi&s;h Square, and to &s;end her with her nur&s;e to that of a gardener at Li&s;&s;on-Green, near Paddington, in who&s;e wife he could confide. She was to remain there &s;ome time, as he was going out of town the next day, to pa&s;s a few months at
<PB N="70" REF="030497_0069_0FE6F6DD155B3578">
the head quarters of his regiment. He then a|ro&s;e to take his leave of Lady Jane; gave her the child's direction; and re&s;pectfully, but pre|cipitately withdrew.</P>
<P>Lady Jane was no &s;ooner alone, than &s;he gave vent to her oppre&s;&s;ed heart. But Lord Darnley had enjoined on her the harde&s;t ta&s;k po&s;&s;ible to a generous mind, that of di&s;&s;imulati|on, and &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf for the fir&s;t time obliged to practi&s;e it. She was compelled therefore to command her feelings, and to endeavour to compo&s;e her appearance. Her heart was to become the &s;ole repo&s;itory of tho&s;e cares, which, alas! &s;he had not a friend to divide.</P>
<P>When Mr. Martindale returned home, he ironically a&s;ked Lady Jane, whom &s;he had &s;een?&mdash;She mentioned Lord Darnley's vi&s;it, but in her confu&s;ion omitted telling him of his reque&s;t that &s;he &s;hould &s;ometimes &s;ee his child. He ob&s;erved that her eyes were red with weep|ing; but how, he &s;aid, could it be otherwi&s;e, while &s;he made Lord Darnley's griefs her own? She began to excu&s;e her&s;elf; he &s;carcely deigned to an&s;wer her, and withdrew to his apartment.</P>
<P>Several weeks pa&s;&s;ed without any change taking place. Lady Jane often pondered on the extraordinary confe&s;&s;ion that had been made her; but &s;he &s;trictly fulfilled her promi&s;e, and buried her &s;ecret within her <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">hing brea&s;t. She even endeavoured as far as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> po&s;&s;ible to bani&s;h the remembrance of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="71" REF="030497_0070_0FE654EEC325CD28">
even hinted to Mrs. Martindale, that &s;he &s;u&s;|pected her mi&s;conduct; and judging from the purity of her own heart, &s;he wi&s;hed, rather than &s;he hoped, that it might be the la&s;t fa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ing of which &s;he &s;hould be ever able to accu&s;e her. She was even &s;o generous in her &s;entiments as in THAT ERROR of Mrs. Martindale's to find an excu&s;e for her cruelty towards her&s;elf. She knew that it was impo&s;&s;ible for &s;o young and &s;o beautiful a woman to be fond of a hu&s;band who was old enough to be her grandfather; and &s;he was convinced that it proceeded &s;olely from a jealou&s;y that had ari&s;en in con&s;equence of the love &s;he bore Lord Darnley. The more &s;he reflected on HIS advanatges, the le&s;s &s;he won|dered at the choice Mrs. Martindale had made.</P>

<P>MR. Martindale became overbearing, and was at times even in&s;olent to Lady Jane. She was no longer in HIS opinion the amiable <HI>Contra&s;t</HI> to Mrs. Martindale; he conceived her virtues to dimini&s;h, and her beauties to decay. Yet he was the only one who &s;u&s;pected either, or who had at lea&s;t dared to &s;ay &s;o. I &s;hould indeed except Mrs. Martindale; who not only viewed her with the eye of hatred, but who al&s;o became indefatigable in her endeavours to poi&s;on the mind both of the old gentleman and his &s;on again&s;t her. Yet &s;he took her mea&s;ures &s;o artfully, that Lady Jane had no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he ever held any private conver&s;ation with them about her.</P>
<P>They were one evening at the Duche&s;s of G&mdash;'s, and Lady Jane was particularly &s;truck with the appearance of a young lady, who never cea&s;ed to look at her. She enquir|ed her name, and found that it was <HI>Mi&s;s Stuart.</HI> She reque&s;ted another lady to introduce them to each other, and particularly a&s;ked after the Colonel. She would have added another name to his, but her re&s;olution for&s;ook her. A far|ther acquaintance was mutually propo&s;ed, and accepted, and Mr. Martindale waited on Colo|nel

Stuart, at his lodgings in Cumberland-&s;treet, the next day. But he did not conde&s;cended to inform Lady Jane at his return of what had pa&s;&s;ed there, neither did he once mention the name of <HI>Glencairn.</HI></P>
<P>In a few days Lady Jane paid a morning vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Stuart, having left a card there the preceding evening. She was admitted, and found that lovely girl &s;itting at a frame for em|broidery. Glencairn was reading to her, and the Colonel was examining different charts which lay on the table. Lady Jane coloured. Glencairn was vi&s;ibly agitated, and in&s;tantly turning to the Colonel, &s;olicited him to walk out; to which the other a&s;&s;enting, they &s;oon di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Stuart, with the freedom of youth and innocence, gave Lady Jane a long account of her travels, which were, &s;he &s;aid, pathetically ended by her witne&s;&s;ing the &s;olemn &s;cene of her friend Mi&s;s Beaumont's renunciation of this life, to pur&s;ue, according to her own ideas, the &s;ure&s;t road to happine&s;s in the next.</P>
<P>They were talking over this, and other matters, when the po&s;tman's knock announced letters; and a &s;ervant delivered one to Mi&s;s Stuart, which Lady Jane entreated her to read without ceremony. She &s;aid it was from Mi&s;s Beaumont (who&s;e name was changed to mother Saint Etienne), congratulating her&s;elf and family on their &s;afe return to England, and lamenting the probability that exi&s;ted of
<PB N="74" REF="030497_0073_0FE6F5FFA418A578">
her &s;eeing them no more. She read it through|out; and then gave it to Lady Jane, reque&s;t|ing her to peru&s;e that charming &s;pecimen of fe|male friend&s;hip and letter-writing. In it, the following pa&s;&s;age fixed all her attention:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>The only point, my dear Mi&s;s Stuart, on which we could ever di&s;agree during our long re&s;idence together in this peaceful con|vent, was that of my &s;eclu&s;ion from the world. When I declared to you that my re&s;olution was fixed on taking the veil, how many dangerous objections did you not hold out to me, in hopes to alter the &s;ettled pur|po&s;e of my heart! You invited me to live with you, and mo&s;t tenderly a&s;&s;ured me, that no future change in your &s;ituation &s;hould be able to effect one in your &s;entiments towards me. Nor was this the only allure|ment you placed before me. Alas! you em|ployed a more dangerous one &s;till, by en|deavouring to unite the duties of religion and worldly affection. You went &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ure me, that my &s;acrifice would be ac|ceptable to God him&s;elf; who, you &s;ay, &s;ent us into this world for the benefit of &s;o|ciety; &s;o that we have no more right to ab|&s;tract our&s;elves from it, than we have to lay down our life when we are weary of it. The world, you told me, abounds with pure and &s;ocial delights; but they can be on|ly enjoyed by tho&s;e who hold an intercour&s;e with it. Yet have you not &s;ometimes, my dear friend, inadvertently owned to me that you are not happy?&mdash;And if YOU, formed
<PB N="75" REF="030497_0074_0FE6F6075B241EC0">
by nature for all its ble&s;&s;ings, are not &s;o, how can you imagine that I, a &s;tranger even in idea, &s;hould be willing to renounce for it a way of life that I have been taught to be|lieve is preferable to every other? You went &s;o far as to a&s;&s;ure me, that your heart has made its choice, and unfortunately fixed it&s;elf where it has no hope of return. That the only man to whom you could wi&s;h to unite your&s;elf is, as you have every rea&s;on to believe, attached el&s;ewhere; and that you &s;u&s;pect, from the hints he has given, that the object of his love is&mdash;<HI>married!</HI></P>
<P>Would not this idea, my dear Mi&s;s Stuart, rather frighten a young novice from the world, than encourage her to enter it?&mdash;I have read of love, though I never felt its in|fluence; and I am thankful that I have nei|ther the inclination nor the power to add one to its numberle&s;s victims.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Lady Jane peru&s;ed this part of the letter with particular emotion; &s;he too &s;urely gue&s;&s;ed that it alluded to Glencairn and her&s;elf, of which &s;he was fully convinced when Mi&s;s Stu|art a&s;ked her <HI>What &s;he thought of Glencairn?</HI> This que&s;tion, which might not have pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ingular, had it not been accompanied with an unea&s;y air of con&s;traint that denoted an over anxious curio&s;ity, &s;uffu&s;ed Lady Jane's coun|tenance with con&s;cious blu&s;hes, that did not e&s;cape the penetrating eyes of Mi&s;s Stuart. Each had &s;poken &s;ufficiently plain to be under|&s;tood by the other, that neither was &s;atisfied.
<PB N="76" REF="030497_0075_0FE6F6075F7E0AD0">
Lady Jane's &s;ilence and vi&s;ible embarra&s;&s;ment were as expre&s;&s;ive as could be the mo&s;t eloquent language. The letter had thrown them into a &s;tate of unea&s;y perplexity; it had di&s;turbed their peace, and was from that moment the &s;ubject to both of many painful reflections.</P>
<P>Lady Jane frequently met Glencairn; and &s;he could not perceive without emotion, and &s;orrow&punc; the tender langour that clouded his fine countenance; con&s;idering as &s;he did, that his attachment to her was the &s;ole cau&s;e of it. Her heart &s;eemed divided between him and Lord Darnley. She was uncon&s;cious of giving the preference to either, and &s;he indulged the pure &s;entiments of innocent affection for both. Mrs. Martindale was continually fabricating tales to her di&s;advantage; &s;he repre&s;ented Lord Darn|ley to her acquaintance as an unprincipled li|bertine, who had taken an advantage of the in|troduction &s;he had given him in her hou&s;e, and had endeavoured by hints too plain to be mi&s;|con&s;trued, to &s;educe her affections from it. She &s;incerely wi&s;hed, &s;he &s;aid, that Lady Jane might not be deceived in the more favourable opinion &s;he had formed of him; for &s;he intimat|ed that her lady&s;hip entertained a very high one. Mrs. Martindale did not openly inveigh again&s;t her, for that might have led to a conviction of the truth; but &s;he wounded her under the ma&s;k of apparent regard; and while &s;he flatter|ed and care&s;&s;ed her, &s;he murdered her repo&s;e, and meditated her final de&s;truction.</P>

<P>THESE ladies continued to be as much together as formerly, and time appeared to have almo&s;t obliterated the remembrance of Lord Darnley, when a circum&s;tance interfered-that was laudable in its cau&s;e, but mo&s;t pernici|ous in its effect. Lady Jane had as I before obd+&s;erved) neglected mentioning to her hu&s;band the promi&s;e &s;he had made him, of &s;ometimes vi&s;iting his daughter. Her time had indeed been &s;o much taken up with other engagements, that &s;he had not yet found a lei&s;ure hour to at|tend to it. She however one morning felt a &s;trong inclination to &s;ee the child; ordered the carriage, and went to Paddington. She found the little cherub looking perfectly well, and &s;taid with it above an hour. She then de&s;ired the nur&s;e would make Mi&s;s Darnley, and her|&s;elf, ready to accompany her; that &s;he would take them for an airing a little farther on the road, and &s;et them down on her return.</P>
<P>They had not proceeded half a mile, before they were met by Mrs. Martindale's carriage, who was in it, with her old man. They both &s;topped; and Mrs. Martindale, giving a &s;ig|nificant look at her hu&s;band, ob&s;erved, <HI>How extreamly odd it was, that they &s;hould meet by accident on the &s;ame road.</HI> Her eyes were in|&s;tantly
<PB N="78" REF="030497_0077_0FE6F60B79ECBC40">
directed to the nur&s;e and child; and both of them appearing in deep mourning, did not leave a doubt who they were. She propo|&s;ed their returning in Lady Jane's coach, and &s;ending back their own; which was complied with. Her motive for doing this, was to di&s;|cover where the child lived. But in that &s;he was di&s;appointed; Lady Jane having determin|ed at that moment to take it to Argyle-&s;treet. She therefore ordered the coachman to drive there, telling the nur&s;e &s;he would &s;end them &s;afe back in the evening.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he returned home, &s;he &s;ent the nur&s;e into the Steward's room, and, taking the child in her arms, went into Mr. Martin|dale's dre&s;&s;ing-room, and begged leave to in|troduce a &s;tranger to his acquaintance, the infant daughter of Lord Darnley. She &s;aid this with a vi&s;ible confu&s;ion, which aro&s;e in con&s;equence of feeling her&s;elf obliged to relate the circum&s;tance of meeting Mr. and Mrs. Martindale, without which it was po&s;&s;ible for him to &s;urmi&s;e that he would not have been informed of her vi&s;it.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE gentle Mi&s;s Stuart became every day more attached to Glencairn, while Mr. Coutenay, an intimate acquaintance of her father's, was as pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her. Mr. Courtenay was a gentleman of Ireland, of con&s;iderable fortune, but de&s;cended from an ob&s;cure family, and many years older than Mi&s;s. Stuart. Yet &s;uch was the nature of Mary, that the&s;e di&s;advantages, had even the want of mo|ney been annexed to them, would have been no impediment to her union with him, had her father wi&s;hed it, and her affections been di&s;en|gaged. But &s;he cheri&s;hed the flatterer, Hope. She believed all that it &s;ugge&s;ted, and &s;he real|ly thought that &s;he &s;hould yet &s;ee the day, when Glencairn would renounce his attach|ment, of which &s;he was no longer uncertain as to the object. Alas! the ro&s;es began once more to fade on her lavely cheek; her &s;pirits gradually for&s;ook her; and her father, per|ceiving both, at length tenderly que&s;tioned her. He mentioned Glencairn, and entreated to be informed of the &s;ituation of her mind, re&s;pect|ing him.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Stuart's heart repo&s;ed on the bo&s;om of this indulgent father; &s;he acknowledged to him
<PB N="80" REF="030497_0079_0FE6F612F80CF020">
her attachment for Glencairn; but &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too much pride ever to &s;uffer that attachment to overcome her rea&s;on. She had ob&s;erved an indifference in his manner towards her, that had con&s;iderably augmented &s;ince their return to England; and &s;he was de|termined rather to &s;acrifice her peace for ever, than to con&s;ent, were he even to urge it, to owe the happine&s;s of being his, to a &s;entiment of pity oniy, with which &s;he might in&s;pire him. Glencairn's heart was, &s;he was well a&s;&s;ured, devoted to another. She did not wi&s;h to di&s;avow that <HI>he</HI> alone would ever remain the object of her mo&s;t &s;ervent affections; but &s;he would never owe the gratification of indulging them to the chance that deprived him of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing that more fortunate woman, and to a &s;entiment that mu&s;t render her acceptance of him de&s;picable in her own eyes, and &s;till more &s;o in her father's.</P>
<P>Sentiments &s;uch as the&s;e could not fail to &s;trengthen in Colonel Stuart, that opinion of his lovely daughter, which had hitherto fallen little &s;hort of adoration. He coincided in all &s;he &s;aid, and gloried in the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes. For what wi&s;h could be &s;o dear to him, as that of &s;eeing his Mary, though &s;truggling with &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, heroic enough to &s;ubdue them? He pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om, and a&s;&s;ur|ed her, that he preferred her happine&s;s to eve|ry worldly con&s;ideration; but that there was <HI>one</HI> beyond the limits of this life, which hung heavy on his mind. He alluded to the period of his own exi&s;tance, which from the cour&s;e of
<PB N="81" REF="030497_0080_0FE6F617372CB5C8">
nature, and his own habitual complaints, was not likely to be prolonged many years. To &s;ee his Mary &s;ettled, was to en&s;ure a happy termination of his days; to leave her without a protector, would embitter his la&s;t moments, the approach of which he wi&s;hed to meet with|out a pang, as they ha&s;tened him to a re-union with her angelic mother!</P>
<P>As he uttered the la&s;t &s;entence, the tears quivered in his expre&s;&s;ive eyes, and gently for|ced their pa&s;&s;age down his venerable cheeks. Mary felt the weight of his argument, but could not command re&s;olution enough to &s;ay &s;he would accept the thrice-proffered hand of Mr. Courtenay: &s;he conjured the Colonel never to mention the &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation to any one; and &s;he &s;till hoped, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he might be at length enabled to eradicate from her mind tho&s;e ideas which &s;he had hitherto &s;o ra&s;hly and &s;o fondly entertained. But &s;he did not tell him ALL &s;he thought; her heart had made its election, and &s;he knew that every en|deavour would be vain to contend again&s;t it. She inwardly determined to cheri&s;h the remem|brance of Glencairn, and, leaving the chance of their future union to him&s;elf, &s;he in &s;ecret re&s;olved never to enter into an engagement that might on her &s;ide impede it.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for Glencairn to be ignor|ant of the attachment he had in&s;pired, neither did he attempt to appear &s;o. He deeply la|mented it, and, with a candour &s;eldom practi&s;|ed among elegant young men, he a&s;&s;ured Co|lonel

Stuart that his friend&s;hip for the lovely Mary exceeded even the bounds of brotherly love. He wi&s;hed, he &s;aid, for the &s;ake of his own peace, and he believed he might with|out vanity&punc; include that of Mary al&s;o, that his heart had not been entangled in a fatal at|tachment, from whence he was never likely to derive a hope of happine&s;s; he added, that he had too delicate a &s;en&s;e of honour to offer her his hand, while he had not a heart to be&s;tow with it. Mi&s;s Stuart, he ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, merited the fir&s;t offerings of the pure&s;t. How could he propo&s;e to make her wretched, by endeavouring to unite her to a man who had it not in his power to forget another; and for whom his love was &s;o criminal, that at the &s;ame time he owned it to his friend, he felt a degree of remor&s;e at lea&s;t equal to it?</P>
<P>Colonel Stuart &s;incerely pitied, and endea|voured to &s;ooth him, for he too had once felt the force of an irre&s;i&s;tible attachment.

<P>Colonel Stuart li&s;tened with a&s;toni&s;hment to the confe&s;&s;ion he had heard; and when he reflected that Glencairn's &s;ole dependance was on him&s;elf, his heart was filled with the fond|e&s;t e&s;teem for his character. Souls, he &s;aid, &s;uch as tho&s;e of Glencairn and his daughter, were &s;urely paired in heaven. Earthly vici&s;&s;i|tudes might for a time &s;eperate, but never could wholly di&s;unite them; and his mind, &s;anguine as Mary's, &s;till pre&s;aged a certainty of future felicity. But, from Glencairn, no|thing could be at pre&s;ent expected. When Co|lonel Stuart &s;aw that he was bent in following his fate, he in&s;i&s;ted, in token of their mutual friend&s;hip, as well as of the tender regard he bore to the memory of his decea&s;ed father, that he &s;hould accept from him a &s;mall annuity of one hundred pounds; and he extorted from him a promi&s;e, that &s;hould he perceive any al|teration in his &s;entiments re&s;pecting Lady Jane Martindale, that he would return to him as his &s;on. To &s;pare the delicacy of Mary, it was
<PB N="84" REF="030497_0083_0FE6F622BA78D388">
nece&s;&s;ary to invent &s;ome plau&s;ible &s;tory; and they agreed to inform her, that unfore&s;een bu|&s;ine&s;s relative to a friend in Scotland (whom they named) would detain Glencairn longer in London, than it would be convenient for the Colonel to &s;tay there. She received the intel|ligence with le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e than they expected, and her father &s;ignified to her his intention of returning to Allanbank the week follow|ing.</P>
<P>On the evening before they were to &s;et out, they all appeared alike affected at their approch|ing &s;eparation. Glencairn knew too well his influence over the heart of Mary, not to dread that her feelings would be overpowered by it; and he mentioned as by chance to the Colonel, before her, that he hoped to join them in Scot|land within a month. While he &s;poke, he ca&s;t a &s;ide-look at Mi&s;s Stuart; he &s;aw her colour change, and the tears which &s;he vainly endea|voured to &s;uppre&s;s. run down her cheeks. He ha&s;tily called for a candle; pretended a drow&s;ine&s;s he was never farther from feeling, and ro&s;e to take his leave. He ki&s;&s;ed Mi&s;s Stuart with the mo&s;t fervent affection; pre&s;&s;ed the Colonel's hand to his heart; and a tear fell on it: he &s;oftly articulated the word <HI>fare|well</HI>&mdash;and retired to his bed-chamber, where he threw him&s;elf on the &s;ofa, and indulged the effu&s;ions <HI>of a heart torn by angui&s;h and de&s;paire.</HI></P>

<P>GLENCAIRN remained near an hour in this &s;tate of agonizing reflection, and was at length rou&s;ed from it by hearing Colonel Stuart and his daughter retire to their apart|ments. He had been reflecting &s;eriou&s;ly on his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and on every thing that had pa&s;&s;ed; but above all, on the fatherly ten|derne&s;s he had ever experienced from Colonel Stuart, and the recent proof of it; on the &s;in|cere affection of his lovely daughter;&mdash;on the &s;ituation of Lady Jane Martindale&mdash;<HI>a married woman!</HI>&mdash;on the di&s;&s;ipated cour&s;e of life &s;he led;&mdash;the cold indifference with which &s;he ap|peared to receive his la&s;t vi&s;it;&mdash;and the hints that had been given him, which gained ground every day, and appeared to taint the purity of her character. All the&s;e con&s;iderations darted like a ray of light on his bewildered mind, and he formed the RESOLUTION to throw him&s;elf at the &s;ame moment at Colonel Stuart's feet, and to implore from him the hand of his daugh|ter. It was a &s;udden and a violent deci&s;ion, that admitted not of reflection. He dreaded to meet with oppo&s;ition from his heart, &s;hould he con&s;ult it; he was no &s;tranger to its weekne&s;s, and he felt that it required all his fortitude to enable him to accompli&s;h his pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="030497_0085_0FE6F623F9023918">Fired by the momentary impul&s;e, he went to the door of Colonel Stuart's apartment, and gently knocking there, reque&s;ted admi&s;&s;ion, and attention to what he had to communi|cate.</P>
<P>The Colonel was not in bed; he had ju&s;t ri|&s;en from his knees, where it was his nightly cu&s;tom to pro&s;trate him&s;elf before his God, in fervent meditation. He was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;|ed at &s;eeing Glencairn, who had not yet begun to undre&s;s, and who, apologizing for his in|tru&s;ion, proceeded to &s;upplicate that he might find in him the tender advocate, not the inflex|ible judge.</P>
<P>He then told him that the purport of his noc|turnal vi&s;it was to implore once more his farther protection and advice. He begged that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t him to follow his own example, and point out to him the path of rectitude which &s;hould direct him to &s;hun the dangerous practi|ces of a world he had already rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e a deceitful one. He a&s;&s;ured him, that he had &s;eriou&s;ly pondered on the &s;entiments of his heart, and was convinced that on the exertions of his rea&s;on his future happine&s;s depended. He was now determined to pur&s;ue that line of con|duct that would be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to his friend and benefactor, and was come to intreat his permi&s;&s;ion to return with him to Scotland; where he doubted not but rea&s;on would &s;oon teach him to overcome a mad attachment, of which he had &s;een the folly, and was therefore re&s;olved to &s;ubdue.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="030497_0086_0FE6F62EF3EAB5E0">Colonel Stuart learned with rapture this hap|py a&s;&s;urance of his pupil's return to virtue; and &s;o indulgent was this excellent man to tho&s;e failings he had never known, that he would have con&s;idered him&s;elf the author of his de|&s;truction, had he not accepted his proffered re|pentance. How many virtuous minds are de|&s;troyed by the want of this indulgence! and how much more laudable is it in a parent, or a friend, to draw a veil over the faults of youth, than to expo&s;e them in the face of day, and, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, augment them by their unkindne&s;s! What a contra&s;t to tho&s;e charac|ters in &s;uch a man as Colonel Stuart! He might be ju&s;tly de&s;cribed as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a thou|&s;and virtues, without a &s;ingle fault; or, if he HAD a fault it proceeded from the unbounded benevolence of his heart, which taught him to view mankind in general with an eye of affecti|on, of which few were de&s;erving. But though he had experienced like others the poi&s;onous effects of ingratitude, he had not yet learned to think ill even of tho&s;e who had proved them|&s;elves unworthy of having known him, His hou&s;e, his heart, and his pur&s;e, were alike ex|tended to all; and it was fortunate for him&s;elf, and his family, that he was a &s;tranger in the gay world, where he mu&s;t have inevitably fal|len a prey to the de&s;igning.

<P>WHEN Mi&s;s Stuart ro&s;e in the morn|ing, &s;he was &s;urprized that Glencairn was to accompany them. Her heart rejoiced, as &s;he interpreted this change in his intentions to the impo&s;&s;ibility he found of leaving her. Their journey was a plea&s;ant one; it was whol|ly undi&s;turbed by care or regret, for &s;he had left nothing in London that could tempt her to wi&s;h ever to return there. But her &s;en&s;&s;ibility was painfully tried, when &s;he fir&s;t beheld Al|lanbank. The old hou&s;e-keeper, who had li|ved there ever &s;ince the Colonel's marriage, welcomed her home with unfeigned joy. She conducted her towards the apartment that had been formerly her late mi&s;tre&s;s's; but when they approached the door of it, Mi&s;s Stuart gave a faint &s;hriek, and fainted in her arms. The worthy Mrs. M'Kenzie was alarmed, but would not open the ill-clo&s;ed wounds of her venerable ma&s;ter's heart, by making him wit|ne&s;s a &s;cene that &s;he knew would be only mo|mentary. She returned to the room where &s;he had left the gentlemen, and giving an expre&s;|&s;ive look at Glencairn, he in&s;tantly followed her. She conducted him up &s;tairs, where they found Mi&s;s Stuart attended by a hou&s;e-maid, and beginning to recover. Glencairn flew to
<PB N="90" REF="030497_0089_0FE6F6301F527A78">
&s;upport her with the tendere&s;t care. She rai&s;|ed her fine eyes, fir&s;t to Heaven, as if to invoke the fainted &s;pirit of her mother, and then turn|ed them with ineffable &s;weetne&s;s upon him; he felt all that &s;he would expre&s;s, and his feelings were worked up to the highe&s;t pitch of grate|ful enthu&s;ia&s;m. He involuntarily dropped on one knee before her, and taking her hand in his, he &s;upplicated the Almighty to &s;trengthen him in his re&s;olution, that he would never, ne|ver for&s;ake her! He aro&s;e when he had ut|tered this prayer. It came from the inmo&s;t re|ce&s;&s;es of his heart, and had been pronounced in too awful a manner for him to retract it; neither would he have done &s;o at that moment, for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lady Jane Martindale her|&s;elf. Mi&s;s Stuart had heard the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ound; it &s;unk from her ear to her heart; &s;he received, and cheri&s;hed it there, as an old friend whom &s;he had been long expecting, and who was at length returned to for&s;ake her no more.</P>
<P>She was now enabled to look over her apart|ment with more compo&s;ure. Her piano-forte had been placed there by the Colonel's order, that &s;he might be reconciled to the &s;ight of it. Glencairn went to his flute, and they pa&s;&s;ed an hour in that happy harmony proceeding from the union of &s;ouls. When alone, Glencairn took the opportunity of offering his heart and hand to Mary. With what mode&s;t joy did &s;he accept the tender a&s;&s;urances of both! She long|ed to ru&s;h into her father's arms, and tell him of her promi&s;ed felicity; but virgin delicacy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">d a re&s;traint on her inclinations, and &s;he left
<PB N="91" REF="030497_0090_0FE6F63A2B5ACCF8">
to Glencairn the ble&s;&s;ed ta&s;k of making him hap|py; for &s;he well knew that his heart, like her own, had been long &s;et on their union. He was not le&s;s anxious than her&s;elf to impart their conver&s;ation to the Colonel, which he did not however find an opportunity of doing, till after Mi&s;s Stuart had left them for the night.</P>
<P>Colonel Stuart received the declaration with an air of re&s;erve that &s;urprized Glencairn, and filled him with confu&s;ion. He de&s;ired that he would allow him&s;elf time to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the nature of the &s;olemn engagement into which he &s;o &s;uddenly and &s;o lightly appeared to wi&s;h to enter. He con&s;idered it, he &s;aid, a duty in|cumbent on him to admoni&s;h them both, and to exhort them to do nothing ra&s;hly; and how could he avoid believing that Glencairn only deceived him&s;elf in his pre&s;ent ideas, when little more than a week had elap&s;ed &s;ince he had in the mo&s;t ingenuous manner acknowledg|ed his inviolable attachment to Lady Jane Mar|tindale? How was he to reconcile &s;uch incon|&s;i&s;tencies?&mdash;He added, that he had too high an opinion of the mind he had taken pride and plea&s;ure to adorn, to imagine for a moment that &s;elf-intre&s;t would have the power to bias one of his actions; at the &s;ame time he owned that his daughter was in that point worthy his attention; and if he doubted his love for her, it proceeded from a fear that he did not know him&s;elf &s;ufficiently to be able to an&s;wer for his future conduct towards her throughout life.</P>
<P>Glencairn endeavoured to wave the&s;e &s;eem|ing
<PB N="92" REF="030497_0091_0FE6F63A2FED0330">
objections. He could not, he &s;aid, di&s;avow his fir&s;t inclination, but he had (at lea&s;t he thought he had) &s;ubdued it. They parted with a promi&s;e from the Colonel, that in the conver|&s;ation he &s;hould have with Mi&s;s Stuart on the &s;ubject, he would not &s;ay any thing that might tend to impede their mutual happine&s;s. In|deed the Colonel knew enough of his daughter's &s;entiments to be convinced, that although no|thing could alter her love for Glencairn, were he once to exert his parental authority, and forbid her to marry him, &s;he would obey him, though at the certain expen&s;e of her happine&s;s, and the probable one of her life.</P>
<P>Colonel Stuart, the next morning, when breakfa&s;t was over, reque&s;ted his daughter's at|tendance in his &s;tudy, where they remained a con&s;iderable time, during which Glencairn did not find his &s;ituation of &s;u&s;pen&s;e perfectly com|fortable. He was at length relieved from it by their appearance, and he perceived that they had both been in tears. The Colonel took a hand of each of his children (as he was wont to call them), and joining them, he with humid eyes be&s;towed on each his ble&s;&s;ing. He could not &s;ay much, for his heart was full, but he de&s;ired that their marriage might take place in two months from that time; &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary ar|rangement with re&s;pect to his fortune being in|di&s;pen&s;able previous to that event. Glencairn &s;aluted the blu&s;hing Mary; they mutually embraced, and thanked the Colonel, and the day was &s;pent as may be &s;uppo&s;ed from the&s;e virtuous minds, each deriving comfort from the happine&s;s of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="030497_0092_0FE6F63D7058F400">Nothing appeared to be wanting at Allen|bank to complete the extent of human felicity. Mi&s;s Stuart became more intere&s;ting as &s;he was more beloved; for though Glencairn was con|&s;cious that he &s;hould not lead her to the altar with that enthu&s;ia&s;tic pa&s;&s;ion that borders on madne&s;s, and which &s;eldom la&s;ts long, his e|&s;teem for, and his opinion of her augmented daily; and Colonel Stuart's winter of life which had been hurried on by grief more than age, appeared on this occa&s;ion to be impeded in its progre&s;s by a renovating &s;pring. They had few vi&s;itors at Allanbank; &s;ome poor Scotch lairds were their principle neighbours, who having never gone beyond the Highlands, were &s;o ignorant and uninformed, that their &s;ociety was rather courted through benevo|lence, than di&s;claimed through pride. It was the intention of the family to pa&s;s &s;ome of the next winter months at Edinburgh. The Colo|nel had a numerous acquaintance there in Mrs. Stuart's lifetime; but &s;ince he had lo&s;t her, and was &s;eparated from his daughter, he neglected every worldly concern. They would not, how|ever, find it difficult to meet with &s;ociety, whenever they vi&s;ited that charming city; for their virtues &s;ecured them friends, wherever they appeared.</P>

<P>I HAVE already ob&s;erved, that the conduct of Mr. Martindale towards Lady Jane was wholly altered. A vi&s;ible coolne&s;s had ta|ken place, and her ears were perpetually a&s;&s;ail|ed by the enumeration of Mrs Martindale's vir|tues. Whatever &s;he &s;aid, was a law both to her hu&s;band and his &s;on, and Lady Jane's life became more in&s;upportable, as her &s;en&s;ibility acquired more &s;trength. She had latterly con|tracted an intimacy with the two Mi&s;s Field|ings, daughters to the late Admiral of that name. They had been intimates of Lady Darnley. The elde&s;t was remarkably accom|pli&s;hed; &s;he was almo&s;t unrivalled on the harp|&s;icord, and &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;oul capable of the mo&s;t refined &s;entiments. Lady Jane was very partial to this young lady, who appeared to be greatly affected by her &s;ituation. She frequently mentioned her di&s;like to Mrs. Mar|tindale; and though Lady Jane had &s;trictly a|voided even hinting at her mi&s;conduct with Lord Darnley, Mi&s;s Fielding gave her rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he was not ignorant of it.</P>
<P>It was now Lent; and Mi&s;s Fielding was ve|ry con&s;tant in her attendance at the Oratorios.
<PB N="95" REF="030497_0094_0FE6F646C40F6DC0">
She had one evening &s;olicited Lady Jane's com|pany in her box at Dury-Lane, who had lat|terly &s;eldom gone into public, but was tempted to accept the invitation, as Giornovich, whom &s;he had never &s;een, was to play there. She had heard much of that charming performer, but found that report, &s;o lavi&s;h in his prai&s;e, was yet unequal to convey a ju&s;t idea of his me|rit. It was <HI>The Me&s;&s;iah</HI> that was performed; and at th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">d of the third part of it, that di|vine mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">n, with an enchanting harmony that can be equalled only in heaven, varied the plaintive <HI>lullaby</HI> in a manner &s;o exqui&s;itely pa|thetic, as to draw tears from the feeling heart of Lady Jane. She took out her pencil, when it was over, and wrote on the back of a letter the following extempore lines:
<Q><L>Seraphic &s;trains the tender feelings move,</L>
<L>And Mu&s;ick melts the &s;oul to heav'n-born love!</L>
<L>Thy powers, oh Giornovich! in&s;pire the brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And give the wounded mind a tran&s;ient re&s;t;</L>
<L>But, while thy notes impa&s;&s;ion'd bo&s;oms plea&s;e,</L>

<L>They leave a new invader of my peace!</L></Q>
She had ju&s;t fini&s;hed the fir&s;t effort of her poe|tical talent, which &s;he intended to correct at lei&s;ure, and was conveying ha&s;tily to her pock|et, when the box door opened, and Lord Darnley made his unexpected appearance. He
<PB N="96" REF="030497_0095_0FE6F646C96F2940">
bowed with infinite grace to the Mi&s;s Field|ings, darted a contemptuous look on Mrs. Mar|tindale (who had obtruded her&s;elf on the par|ty, from a very &s;light invitation), and with more apparent plea&s;ure than prudence &s;miled on Lady Jane, and &s;eated him&s;elf immediately behind her. He told her, he had been in town but a few hours; that he had fir&s;t vi&s;ited THEIR little charge, and then called in Argyle-Street; but hearing from her &s;erva<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> that &s;he was gone to Drury-Lane, he had ta<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">n the li|berty to follow her there.</P>
<P>Mrs Martindale who was pretending to adju&s;t her handkerchief, did not lo&s;e a word of this &s;peech; but &s;aid, loud enough to be heard in the next box, That now one impediment was removed, on his lord&s;hip's &s;ide, &s;he thought the other might be ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed; for &s;he was pretty &s;ure that young Mr, Martindale would not have much objection to &s;ee his name added to the li&s;t of happy hu&s;bands in Doctors commons. This was too gro&s;s an in|&s;ult to be patiently endured; but Lord Darn|ley, however confu&s;ed, was too well-bred a man to recriminate. Lady Jane faintly a&s;ked her what &s;he meant; and pleading the exce&s;|&s;ive heat of the hou&s;e as an excu&s;e for leaving the Mi&s;s Fieldings, reque&s;ted Lord Darnley (who was the only gentleman in the box) to &s;ee her to her carriage, where &s;he in&s;i&s;ted, however reluctantly, on his taking his leave.</P>
<P>Mr. Martindale was already in bed, and &s;he was obliged to defer &s;peaking to him till morn|ing.
<PB N="97" REF="030497_0096_0FE6F6499B2FA010">
Mrs. Drapery informed her, that Lord Darnley had been there, but, on finding her lady&s;hip was out, had reque&s;ted to &s;ee her wo|man. That &s;he went to the coach door, and he a&s;ked her many que&s;tions about the &s;tate of the family; telling her,
<Q>That he would do hand&s;omely by her, if &s;he would keep his &s;ecret, which was, to tell her lady, that in con&s;equence of letters he had received from town, which mentioned the di&s;agreeable &s;i|tuation into which her lady&s;hip was thrown by the machinations of Mrs. Martindale, he was arrived, fully determined to protect her with his life.</Q></P>
<P>Old&s;on, the butler, had watched this inter|view; and whether jealou&s;y of Mrs. Drapery, or &s;ome other &s;u&s;picion, aro&s;e in his mind, I know not; but he in&s;i&s;ted on her telling him all that had pa&s;&s;ed. Nay, he was &s;o re&s;olved on knowing it, that he even threatened Mrs. Dra|pery to retract his promi&s;e of marriage to her, if &s;he did not immediately confe&s;s every thing to him. Any other menace Mrs. Drapery might po&s;&s;ibly have with&s;tood; but that of a di&s;appointment in love was too powerful. She candidly acknowledged the confidence Lord Darnley had placed in her, but fir&s;t obtained a promi&s;e from Mr. Old&s;on of his &s;ilence on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed to pre&s;uade her not to mention it to her lady; but this tru&s;ty confidante, recol|lecting Lord Darnley's offer to <HI>do hone&s;tly by her,</HI> longed for the moment when &s;he &s;hould be at
<PB N="98" REF="030497_0097_0FE6F649A1B99B20">
liberty to divulge the &s;ecret of which &s;he had been till then in painful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lady Jane felt a glow of &s;atisfaction ri&s;e on her cheek, as &s;he li&s;tened to Mrs. Drapery's information. Situate as &s;he then was, every proof of regard, even from the mo&s;t indifferent per&s;on, became dear to her. The cruel and unmerited treatment &s;he every day endured, had the &s;ame effect on her gentle mind that a &s;tormy &s;ea has on a mariner. Her heart panted for re&s;t, for &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf environed by ene|mies where &s;he might naturally have expected friends. She felt that matters were drawing to a cri&s;is, that would &s;oon determine her fu|ture fate.</P>
<P>The next morning &s;he told Mr. Martindale of the in&s;ult that had been offered to her at the Oratorio. He &s;eemed perfectly indifferent, and &s;aid &s;he might thank her&s;elf for it: that when a married woman had once openly admitted the addre&s;&s;es of another man, her hu&s;band could not be blamed for di&s;carding her. That he had no cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t Lord Darn|ley, as he conceived that he had acted only as every other gay man would do in the &s;ame &s;i|tuation; and he fini&s;hed by telling her that &s;he was perfectly at liberty to follow Lord Darn|ley's fortunes wherever they might lead her.</P>
<P>That calm &s;erenity of mind which had ever dignified the exemplary character of Lady Jane Martindale, now entirely for&s;ook her. She
<PB N="99" REF="030497_0098_0FE6F651F90EC408">
uttered the mo&s;t piercing complaints again&s;t her unfeeling hu&s;band for his inju&s;tice and cruelty towards her, and the mo&s;t bitter invectives a|gain&s;t the infamous Mrs. Martindale; and when &s;he &s;aw that it was impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade him of her innocence, &s;he found it nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to mea&s;ures the mo&s;t repugnant to her feelings, and at once to declare&punc; all &s;he knew: &s;he then entered into a minute detail of the intrigue that had been carried on between Mrs. Martindale and Lord Darnley at the French milliner's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Martindale rang for his hat, and went immediately to his father's, telling Lady Jane he &s;hould return pre&s;ently. He did &s;o; and his countenance was inflamed by anger, as he a&s;ked her,
<Q>How &s;he dared to a&s;per&s;e the cha|racter of of a virtuous woman?</Q>
She had en|deavoured, he &s;aid, to de&s;troy that of Mrs. Martindale, becau&s;e &s;he had refu&s;ed to become a partner in her vices. She was jealous, he &s;uppo&s;ed, of Mrs. Martindale's &s;uperior beauty and qualifications, and of the attention Lord Darnley had, like other men, paid her. He advi&s;ed her to take up her re&s;idence with THEIR charge, at Paddington, and limited her to three days to remove her effects from his hou&s;e: he excepted his mother's jewels, which he in&s;i&s;ted on having immediately re&s;tored to him. He then rang the bell, which was an|&s;wered by Old&s;on, whom he commanded in a peremptory manner no longer to con&s;ider La|dy Jane as his mi&s;tre&s;s, and to make known that &s;uch were his injunctions to all the other
<PB N="100" REF="030497_0099_0FE6F65201377278">
dome&s;tics. Old&s;on would have &s;poken, but was prevented by a look that forbade all po&s;&s;ibi|lity of a reply. He then ordered a chai&s;e and four to be immediately got in readine&s;s from the neare&s;t inn, and told Old&s;on to prepare to ac|company him.</P>
<P>The triumph of pa&s;&s;ion was &s;oon over; and a tear of pity. and perhaps of remaining ten|derne&s;s (which he u&s;ed every effort to &s;up|pre&s;s), fell down his cheeks as he took hold of Lady Jane's hand: when turning his head on the other &s;ide, he bade her an eternal adieu. He threw bank notes on the table to the value of five hundred pounds, and then tore him&s;elf from her in a paroxy &s;in of agony that fell little &s;hort of her own.</P>

<P>IN a moment like this, how was Lady Jane Martindale to proceed? Were I to a&s;k a hundred people, I &s;hould receive a hundred different opinions; but Lady Jane had no time for reflection. The arrow had been aimed at her heart, and it was lodged there. She order|ed Mrs. Drapery into her pre&s;ence; who, with many tears, be&s;ought her to compo&s;e her|&s;elf. She de&s;ired her to pack up in a box by them&s;elves, all the jewels and trinkets that old Mr. Martindale and his &s;on had once given to her, but of which &s;he was no longer the mi&s;|tre&s;s; and then a&s;ked as a favour, what but two hours before &s;he had a right to command, that one of the &s;ervants might go for a hack|ney coach, that &s;he might call at two or three places &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary, while her wo|man was packing up her clothes, as &s;he de&s;ired. She was going fir&s;t to &s;ee Mrs. Martindale; for though her noble heart &s;hrunk from the idea of &s;upplicating her enemy, yet &s;he thought it a duty &s;he owed her&s;elf, to explain to that lady, as matters now &s;tood, the nece&s;&s;ity that had driven her to give &s;uch a painful explana|tion of every circum&s;tance that could tend to corroborate her own innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="030497_0101_0FE6F6548A6A65A8">With &s;wollen eyes, which &s;he endeavoured as much as po&s;&s;ible to conceal by her long lace veil, &s;he &s;tepped into the coach, and ordered it to Devon&s;hire-Place. Alas! the &s;ervants there had not only received orders never more to ad|mit her, but were even in&s;olent enough to ex|pre&s;s before the coachman their a&s;toni&s;hment at her calling there. She then went to Mi&s;s Fielding's and had the &s;atisfaction to find that her friend was at home. They knew nothing more of the mi&s;intelligence than what had pa&s;&s;|ed at the oratorio, and entreated her to return home, and to inform them the next morning in what manner it had been &s;ettled. Lady Jane, after a &s;hort vi&s;it, returned to Argyle-Street, and found a &s;ervant of old Mr. Martin|dale's, who had brought a note from his &s;on, and only waited for an an&s;wer to leave town. In it he de&s;ired her to &s;end him an inventory, directed to Led&s;tone, of the things &s;he had left there, which he &s;aid &s;hould be &s;ent to her wherever &s;he might appoint, as he was going to &s;ell that e&s;tate. It contained al&s;o a reque&s;t that &s;he would quit Argyle-Street as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and that &s;he would not attempt mak|ing Mrs. Drapery the companion of her &s;lights as it would be the means of preventing that per|&s;on's being re&s;pectfully &s;ettled with Old&s;on, and he doubted Lady Jane's future ability of re|compen&s;ing her, if &s;he attempted to prevent it.</P>
<P>Lady Jane po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed too much of the pride in&s;eparable from a noble mind. to be required a third time to quit the hou&s;e. She ea&s;ily
<PB N="103" REF="030497_0102_0FE6F65F18E29EE8">
perceived that Drapery's views on Old&s;on &s;u|per&s;eded all affection for her&s;elf; and that al|though he would willingly have &s;uffered her for the pre&s;ent to accompany her, yet he fear|ed his ma&s;ter's di&s;plea&s;ure were &s;he to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Lady Jane de&s;ired Old&s;on to change for her a fifty pounds note; &s;he gave ten to Mrs. Dra|pery more than was due to her for the trouble &s;he had in packing up her things, which &s;he de&s;ired her to take care of till &s;he &s;ent for them. Another ten &s;he gave to Old&s;on to divide a|mong the &s;ervants, be&s;ides two guineas for him|&s;elf; and in a fit of wild de&s;pair, unaccompani|ed by a &s;ingle attendant, and without having ta&s;ted of the dinner that the &s;ervants had as u&s;ual prepared, and placed before her, &s;he &s;ent for a hackney coach at ten o'clock at night, and ordered the coachman to drive her which way he plea&s;ed, till &s;he &s;hould otherwi&s;e direct him.</P>

<P>THE coachman proceeded on a journey he could not rightly comprehend, and at length &s;topped at the turnpike beyond We&s;t|min&s;ter-bridge. Lady Jane was ruminating whither &s;he &s;hould go, when &s;he was rou&s;ed from her reverie by a demand for the toll. Her memory brought &s;everal per&s;ons to her recollection, but &s;he dreaded to meet with a cool reception, wherever &s;he appeared, and made known her &s;tory. Of Lord Darnley's addre&s;s &s;he was ignorant, and the latene&s;s of the hour would alone have prevented her cal|ling on him. She de&s;ired the coachman would drive her to Li&s;&s;on Green, where &s;he found that the family was already in bed. She knock|ed repeatedly, and at length with &s;ome diffi|culty obtained admi&s;&s;ion into the nur&s;e's bed|chamber.</P>
<P>She apologized for her un&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it, and the my&s;tery of its appearance, di&s;charged the coach, and by down by the &s;leeping infant. But &s;he could neither compo&s;e her&s;elf, nor let the nur&s;e, till &s;he had made &s;ome enquiries re|&s;pecting Lord Darnley. The an&s;wer was pro|ductive of the only &s;atisfaction it was at that moment in her power to receive, as &s;he found
<PB N="105" REF="030497_0104_0FE6F6609CC72060">
that he had promi&s;ed to be there the next morn|ing by twelve o'clock, She &s;oon after clo&s;ed her wearied eye-lids, and &s;unk to momentary re&s;t.</P>
<P>Lord Darnley was punctual to his appointed hour; and giving his hor&s;e to the groom, ran eagerly up &s;taris. Nothing could equal his a|mazement at &s;eeing Lady Jane there, pale, di&s;hevelled, and half-dre&s;t, &s;itting with his child on her knee. She aro&s;e as he entered, and giving mi&s;s Darnley into the nur&s;e's arms, de|&s;ired &s;he would retire with her into the garden, while &s;he &s;poke to her Lord. But when &s;he began to relate her mournful tale, &s;he found her&s;elf wholly unable to proceed. She cla&s;ped her hands in &s;peechle&s;s agony, and lifting up her eyes to <HI>Him</HI> who could alone &s;upport and &s;trengthen her in the hour of affliction, &s;he bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>When &s;he had a little recovered her&s;elf, &s;he explained, as well as &s;he was able, her unde|&s;erved &s;ituation; leaving the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;al of her&s;elf to the &s;uperior judgment of Lord Darnley, who&s;e protection was the only one &s;he could now claim. He took her hand, and thanking her for the confidence with which &s;he honoured him, be&s;ought her permi&s;&s;ion to go in&s;tantly to town in order to provide for her a more &s;uitable apartment. He left her, and in le&s;s than three hours returned in a po&s;t|chai&s;e, in which &s;he gladly accompanied him &s;he knew not, nor cared not whither.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="030497_0105_0FE6F660A088CBE0">The temporary re&s;idence that Lord Darnley had procured for Lady Jane, was at a lodging hou&s;e in Great Cumberland Street; and he took one for him&s;elf within a few doors of it, which happened to be the &s;ame that had been occupied by Colonel Stuart and his family. But this he did not know; and not choo&s;ing at once to inform Lady Jane of his being &s;o near a neighbour, &s;he al&s;o remained ignorant of it. Lord Darnley had called her in both hou&s;es Lady Findlater, and &s;aid &s;he was a baronet's widow. This had been agreed on in the chai&s;e, to prevent &s;u&s;picion or enquiry. He pa&s;&s;ed &s;e|veral hours of the day with her, and &s;he &s;aw no other per&s;on. His valet, who u&s;ually at|tended her, was a new one, who fortunately had not &s;een or heard of her before. But it was nece&s;&s;ary to intru&s;t the nur&s;e, who was a decent woman, and to be depended on. She was moreover a&s;&s;ured that &s;he would lo&s;e her place from the moment there was the lea&s;t cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that &s;he had betrayed her Lord.</P>
<P>From her they &s;oon received intelligence, that &s;he had been &s;everal times followed by dif|ferent people whom &s;he did not know, as &s;he went in and out of town with Mi&s;s Darnley; in con&s;equence of which it became nece&s;&s;ary to remove them, and they were &s;ent to Bromp|ton.</P>
<P>A fatality is frequently attendant on different &s;ituations in life, which eludes all that the mo&s;t watchful vigilance can &s;urmi&s;e to prevent it. It was &s;o in the pre&s;ent incident. Not all the
<PB N="107" REF="030497_0106_0FE6F669CB17BCA8">
caution ob&s;erved both by Lady Jane and Lord Darnley, nor the fidelity of the nur&s;e could counteract the decree of fate. Great effects proceed frequently from trivial cau&s;es, which can be neither fore&s;een nor prevented.</P>
<P>Lord Darnley's valet perceived that there was &s;ome my&s;tery about Lady Findlater; but being a country fellow, who knew nothing of London, and being much confined at home, he had no opportunity of talking over his Lord's affairs among his fellow-&s;ervants; and the nur&s;e, who was rather a pretty girl, hardly conde|&s;cended to &s;peak to him. Lord Darnley had one morning written to Lady Jane, and in|tru&s;ted as u&s;ual the note to his &s;ervant; who thought this a good opportunity to &s;atisfy the curio&s;ity of their landlady, with whom he had frequently conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject. She was overjoyed at his offer, and particularly &s;o as he reque&s;ted her to give it into the lady's own hands, which was a charge he al&s;o had received from his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>She took the note, and went directly to the door of the apartment, which was to her un|&s;peakable a&s;toni&s;hment, opened by Lady Jane Martindale, who was as much confu&s;ed as her|&s;elf; &s;he fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected that it was &s;ome trick put upon her by her family, till &s;he learned that Lord Darnley was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Colonel Stuart's former lodgings in her hou&s;e. She en|treated her to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t inviolable &s;e|crecy, which was faithfully promi&s;ed, without any intention of performing it&middot;</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="030497_0107_0FE6F669CECFF630">This &s;lender circum&s;tance laid a la&s;ting foun|dation for every &s;ub&s;equent event of Lady Jane's life. The moment the landlady returned home, &s;he put on her hat and cloak with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, and telling the valet &s;he was going to market, without any farther explanation, po&s;t|ed directly to Mr. Martindale's hou&s;e in Ar|gyle Street, whither &s;he had once been on a vi&s;it to Mrs. Drapery, in company with Jo|&s;ephine, Mi&s;s Stuart's Neapolitan maid. Mrs. Drapery was at home, and in the act of writ|ing to her dear Old&s;on, who was &s;till at Led|&s;tone with his ma&s;ter. As &s;oon as &s;he had heard ALL, &s;he pre&s;ented her vi&s;itant with a gla&s;s of her be&s;t cordial, and begged to have the HO|NOUR of her company another time, as &s;he was ju&s;t fini&s;hing an important letter, and feared being too late for the po&s;t. The&s;e two wor|thy females exchanged &s;everal polite curte&s;ies, and parted highly &s;atisfied with each other; the one having communicated all &s;he knew, and the other having heard all &s;he wi&s;hed; for they were till that moment ignorant of Lady Jane's de&s;tination. Mrs. Drapery added ano|ther &s;heet to her already voluminous packet; and as &s;oon as &s;he had di&s;patched it, and fini&s;h|ed her dinner, &s;he &s;ent for every one of the &s;ervants into the hou&s;keeper's room, to whom &s;he related the whole of this marvellous tale.</P>
<P>Mrs. Drapery was now &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e; con&s;equently whatever &s;he &s;aid, was the grand rule of their actions. I mu&s;t indeed except a York&s;hire groom; who having &s;at like
<PB N="109" REF="030497_0108_0FE6F66AD67C2250">
the re&s;t open-mouthed to hear pronounced the &s;entence of his lady's condemnation, declared "he would go to her that very moment, and know in what he could &s;erve her, for that &s;he was as good a lady as ever broke bread; and he was certain that as for York&s;hire, there was never a gentleman in the whole country that would have turned &s;uch a tender-hearted lady out of doors, but that he had heard the&s;e Lon|doners would do any thing. He did not care for his ma&s;ter; he might hang him if he liked, and keep his wages into the bargain; but that now he knew where to find his lady, he would go and offer his &s;ervice to her; ay, and &s;tick by her, if &s;he would let him, without a farth|ing wages, as long as he lived."</P>
<P>Mrs. Drapery expatiated on the re&s;entment of an enraged ma&s;ter, and the de&s;truction that would inevitably overtake him, and finally pre|vent his ever getting another place, &s;hould he per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a fooli&s;h &s;cheme:&mdash;but all would not do; nothing could induce Tom to relin|qui&s;h his pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; and with all the blunt hone&s;ty and feeling of a TRUE YORK|SHIREMAN, he went immediately to his ma&s;|ter's &s;tables, where, giving up his charge of the &s;addle-hor&s;es to the coachman, he packed up his all in a &s;mall bundle, and without taking leave of his a&s;&s;ociates, whom his heart cur&s;ed for their cruelty, he walked with aching &s;teps towards Great Cumberland Street.</P>
<P>In his way thither, he reflected for the fir&s;t time of his life on what he was about. He had
<PB N="110" REF="030497_0109_0FE6F66ADAF6EC70">
given up his place, and all the intere&s;t he had, without having any ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that Lady Jane would befriend him. What was he to do if &s;he refu&s;ed him an a&s;ylum?&mdash;Tom had no friends in London; they were all in|habitants of Ripon; yet Tom did not repent, He already had received full compen&s;ation for any hard&s;hips he might in future undergo. He had experienced that inward joy, that inde|&s;cribable felicity of having given way to the genuine feelings of an hone&s;t heart. He did not &s;uppo&s;e that his lady would &s;uffer him to want; but if &s;he did, he &s;hould only be reduc|ed to temporary nece&s;&s;ity, and that too in a noble cau&s;e; <HI>the cau&s;e of injured innocence.</HI> His friends were indu&s;trious, hard-working people, who would not, he was very &s;ure, di&s;mi&s;s him becau&s;e he did not bring them <HI>Gold.</HI> No; they had ever prayed him to remain a|mong them &s;teady to the plough, as his fore|fathers had been; but Tom had &s;een laced live|ries in the neighbourhood of Ripon; and more from the generous motive of thinking he could henceforward add to the little wealth al|ready po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his family, than any &s;elf-in|tere&s;ted principle of his own, he had &s;et out on his perilous journey, TO SEE THE WORLD.</P>

<P>TOM was at fir&s;t refu&s;ed admittance; till by his &s;obs and tears, and his a&s;&s;everati|on that he had left his place for no other rea&s;on than to wait on his lady, he prevailed on the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e to go up &s;tairs a &s;econd time, and &s;he con&s;ented to &s;ee him, He briefly related by what means he had di&s;covered her re&s;idence, and begged her lady&s;hip's pardon for his boldne&s;s in coming after her, and the mo|tive which had induced him to do &s;o. Lady Jane thanked him for his attention, and draw|ing five guineas from her pur&s;e advi&s;ed him to return to his place, or, if he did not choo&s;e that, &s;he would recommend him, &s;he &s;aid, to Lord Darnley, who would procure him ano|ther. Tom looked fir&s;t at the money, and then wi&s;tfully at Lady Jane; for he feared to offend, as he begged to be excu&s;ed taking it; and he ventured to hint, that, not &s;eeing any &s;ervants about her, he thought &s;he could but ill &s;pare it; and all he implored was, that &s;he would keep him in her &s;ervice. The poor creature pleaded &s;o powerfully, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he could without cruelty re&s;i&s;t him; &s;o ordering him to put the money in his pocket, &s;he &s;uffered him to enter on the plea&s;ing ta&s;k of rendering him&s;elf a faithful attendant on her.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="030497_0111_0FE6F66EDF036078">Lady Jane employed the remainder of the morning in writing a long narative of facts to her father. She endeavoured to prepare him in the mo&s;t delicate and pathetic manner for the knowledge of her misfortunes, and anticipated the total forgetfulne&s;s of the&s;e, in his &s;ympa|thizing tenderne&s;s. She ob&s;erved that &s;he had only quitted an unplea&s;ant home, to return to her native happy one; and &s;he reque&s;ted his ap|probation of her joining him immediately in Ireland. With eager expectation &s;he told him &s;he &s;hould wait his reply, which would in eve|thing determine her future conduct. Her hours appeared to grow lighter from the moment her letter was given to the po&s;tman, and &s;he fol|lowed in idea its ha&s;ty progre&s;s during the night; forming a thou&s;and plea&s;ing conjectures on the event of its &s;ucce&s;s. Lord Darnley had for the fir&s;t time neglected vi&s;iting her that e|vening; but when he called the next morning, he found her more cheerful than he had hither|to &s;een her; and as the day was remarkably fine, he propo&s;ed their going in a hackney coach to &s;ee Mi&s;s Darnley at Brompton, and walking in one of the retired paths of its neigh|bourhood. Lord Darnley returned to dinner with her, and had been ju&s;t propo&s;ing to ac|company her to Ireland as &s;oon as &s;he received her father's an&s;wer; telling her, that now the Martindales knew where to find them both, he doubted not but that all po&s;&s;ible means would be tried to ha&s;ten a divorce: and he hoped to receive, as &s;oon as it was pronounced, her hand from her father. He had never &s;poken &s;o open|ly before. In tho&s;e few words were compre|hended
<PB N="113" REF="030497_0112_0FE6F677F1BF7D28">
all &s;he wi&s;hed to hear, and &s;he felt elat|ed at the idea of being re&s;tored to happine&s;s. Their conver&s;ation was interrupted by the en|trance of Tom, who brought a letter that had been put into his hands by one of the &s;ervants from Argyle-&s;treet; it was addre&s;&s;ed to Lady Jane; &s;he knew her hu&s;band's hand on the direction, which was all he had written. In the blank cover was a letter to him&s;elf, which had been &s;ent to Led&s;tone, and was from thence forwarded by him. It bore the Iri&s;h po&s;t-mark, and was &s;ealed with black. Lady Jane &s;aw the &s;ignature, and fainted away. Her heart fore|boded its dreadful contents; there was no need of her reading it, to be convinced of <HI>this, her greate&s;t misfortune!</HI> Lord Darnley took it up, and found that it contained an affecting re|que&s;t from the &s;teward to Mr. Martindale, that he would break the news of the Earl's &s;udden death to Lady Jane in the tendere&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible- He had departed this but two hours before it was written, con&s;equently no know|ledge codld be had of the &s;ituation in which he had left his affairs; but the &s;teward added, that as he had rea&s;on to believe his lor&s;t&s;hip had left Mr. Martindale &s;ole executor, he entreated that gentleman to come with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to Dublin.</P>
<P>Lady Jane &s;oon recovered from her &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility; but her heart was turned to woe, and &s;he bore this afflicting circum&s;tance with more compo&s;ure at the moment than might have been expected. She looked up to Lord Darn|ley as HER ONLY FRIEND, for where in the

va&s;t univer&s;e could &s;he claim another?&mdash;He &s;incerely felt for and pitied her, and he promi&s;|ed her every a&s;&s;i&s;tance, at this di&s;mal junct|ure, that &s;he could derive from his affection, his &s;ociety, and advice. But &s;he was deeply affected by her recent lo&s;s; and her grief was of the mo&s;t dangerous kind, as it grew into a &s;ettled melancholy, which increa&s;ed daily. She continually pondered on her &s;ituation, and at length, without con&s;ulting Lord Darnley, or even mentioning the circum&s;tance to him, &s;he wrote to Mi&s;s Fielding, giving her a cir|cum&s;tantial detail of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and entreating to &s;ee her. She gave Tom orders to wait for an an&s;wer, and he brought back her own letter, un&s;ealed, in a blank cover. She found her&s;elf DESPISED AND REJECTED, and a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ad ideas filled her very &s;oul. The wounded mind will, like the drown|ing man, catch at every &s;hadow of a &s;ub&s;tance; and Lady Jane, penetrated with Lord Darn|ley's attentive friend&s;hip, in&s;en&s;ibly attached her&s;elf to him. He could now prevail on her with le&s;s difficulty to accompany him in riding, walking, &amp;c, till by degrees &s;he gave her&s;elf up irrecoverably to him, and refu&s;ed nothing to a man whom &s;he with confidence con&s;idered as her future hu&s;band and natural protector.</P>
<P>Lady Jane and Lord Darnley were more publickly together than formerly, but &s;till kept their re&s;pective lodgings. In le&s;s than a month after her father's death, &s;he received a &s;econd letter from the &s;teward, written at the de&s;ire of Mr. Martindale, who was, he informed

The Colonel was perfectly ignorant whether he was living or dead. But as old age brings reflecti|on, and draws us naturally back to our fir&s;t attachments, Mr. Stuart at la&s;t recollected that he had a brother, who he had lately heard was not only living, but was a widower, with an only daughter. He wrote rather a kind letter to the Colonel, giving a long account of him|&s;elf. He had been married, he &s;aid, twice; and had three children, none of whom &s;urvi|ved; and his la&s;t wife, who was al&s;o his la&s;t tie in that country, was lately dead. He com|plained of his age and infirmities, and acknow|ledged that he had made a con&s;iderable fortune
<PB N="117" REF="030497_0116_0FE6F68186038530">
in the ea&s;t, which in was his intention to be|queath to his niece. He de&s;ired that the Colo|nel would either embark in the fir&s;t &s;hip de&s;tin|ed to India, or that he would &s;end over &s;ome per&s;on, in whom he could place confidence, to attend to the &s;ettling of his affairs; he added, that in ca&s;e of his dying before &s;uch a one arri|ved, he had already taked care to make a will in favour of Mi&s;s Stuart, his niece.</P>
<P>The Colonel exulted but little in his daugh|ter's unexpected pro&s;pect of future fortune. She had enough to make her happy, and they co|veted no more Yet it was nece&s;&s;ary on every account to accede to her uncle's reque&s;t. She might have a large family, and it was a duty incumbent on him not to neglect a circum&s;tance that had the appearance of turning out &s;o much to her advantage, and &s;o far beyond their ex|pectation. To ca&s;t away a gift that was as it were thrown into their lap, would be, accor|ding to Colonel Stuart's ideas, to render them+&s;elves; unworthy the di&s;pen&s;ations of provi|dence in their favour. The only difficulty was, to determine on who was proper to go over. It was a long perilous voyage to be undertaken by the Colonel; and he could not think of &s;e|parating Glencairn and his daughter, at a mo|ment when they were on the point of marri|age, and when every thing &s;eemed to &s;mile propitious on their union.</P>
<P>When he met them, his countenance bore the vi&s;ible marks of perturbation and anxiety; and it was &s;ome time before he could collect
<PB N="118" REF="030497_0117_0FE6F68189BAAD48">
him&s;elf &s;ufficiently to impart to them the con|tents of the letter. Glencairn and Mary watched each other's countenance while he was reading it; but when the Colonel &s;ignified his intention of fir&s;t joining their hands, and then leaving them while he made the long, long voyage, Mary at once declared that &s;he would rather relinqui&s;h every earthly advantage than &s;uffer her father to undertake it. To her, and to Glencairn, no increa&s;e of fortune could bring increa&s;e of happine&s;s; and why &s;hould they traver&s;e &s;eas to ri&s;k the lo&s;s of THAT, of which they were already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>Glencairn &s;tood in a delicate &s;ituation. His wandering heart prompted him to in&s;i&s;t on being the deputed per&s;on, yet he feared two unkind con&s;tructions that might be put on it if he did &s;o; and the&s;e were, indifference towards Ma|ry, and &s;elf intere&s;t. If either of them pre|ponderated, it was not &s;urely the letter. He a&s;ked Mary what he &s;hould do?&mdash;She expect|ed, yet was not immediately prepared for the que&s;tion. It was about the time when the In|diamen were to &s;ail; and while Colonel Stuart retired to his &s;tudy to write to a friend in Lon|don in order io make proper enquiries about them, Mi&s;s Stuart and Glencairn walked into the garden, where they agreed that there was no alternative between his going to India, and the lo&s;s of her uncle's favour and fortune.</P>
<P>When Colonel Stuart &s;aw that it was in vain to oppo&s;e Glencairn's re&s;olution, &s;trengthened by the con&s;ent of Mary, he told him he &s;hould
<PB N="119" REF="030497_0118_0FE6F68BE9102948">
leave it entirely to him&s;elf, and his daughter, whether their marriage &s;hould take place before or after his return; but Mi&s;s Stuart begged to continue in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation till he did &s;o. She thought &s;he &s;hould be better able to bear his ab&s;ence as her friend, than as her hu&s;band: they were already betrothed; &s;he could not doubt his love for her; and &s;he con&s;idered the &s;acrifice he was about to make, as the greate&s;t proof that he could give of it.</P>
<P>The Colonel u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch in for|warding every nece&s;&s;ary preparation for Glen|cairn's departure; and he &s;oon received an an|&s;wer from the friend to whom he hnd written, who was one of the Ea&s;t India Directors, in|forming him that his pa&s;&s;age was taken on board the Melville Ca&s;tle, which was to &s;ail in three weeks. The arrival of this letter cau&s;ed a few pearly drops to trickle down the cheeks of Mary; but the blow was given, and it was too late to recede.</P>

<P>WE will pa&s;s over the melancholy &s;epa|ration, and, leaving Colonel and Mi&s;s Stuart at Allanbank in better health than &s;pi|rits, accompany Glencairn to London.</P>
<P>As he approached the gay metropolis, his mind dwelt on the idea of Lady Jane Martindale. E|very carriage that he met he fancied to contain her, and every well dre&s;t per&s;on he &s;aw he an|xiou&s;ly looked at, as &s;uppo&s;ing he could receive from them &s;ome information of her. On the morning after his arrival, he waited on the Di|rector with a letter from Colonel Stuart; but finding he was gone to Blackwall, to dine on board the Melville Ca&s;tle, he ordered a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and followed him. He was introduced by that gentleman to Captain Dundas and the other officers, and was much plea&s;ed both with his acquaintance and his birth there. He was informed that the &s;hip was to go down the river in ten days. He returned to town with his new friend in the evening, and on their way could not forbear a&s;king him if he was acquaint|ed with the Martindale family?&mdash;By report on|ly, was the reply; and indeed he &s;aid the late tran&s;actions of that family were not calculated to make any per&s;on wi&s;h to know more of them.
<PB N="121" REF="030497_0120_0FE6F68D74DECE28">
This led to an explanation, and, when they arrived, to the peru&s;al of a new&s;paper a few days old, which was at the Director's, and contained a long account of the ELOPEMENT of Lady Jane Martindale with Lord Darnley, <HI>&amp;</HI>c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Glencairn was engaged to &s;tay &s;upper, but retired to his hotel as &s;oon as it was over; and finding that a porter kept watch all night, he put on a great coat, and walked immediately to Argyle Street. When he approached the hou&s;e, he heard the &s;ound of fiddles, and people danc|ing: he at once di&s;believed the report, think|ing it very unlikely, if it were true, that Mr. Martindale &s;hould have a ball in his hou&s;e. He was however &s;oon convinced of his error, when he &s;aw &s;everal odd-looking men reeling out of it, and heard them hallooing for coaches for the LADIES. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the mo&s;t decent-looking one, who told him it was Mrs. Drapery's birth-day, and that all the no|blemen's gentleman and ladies' women of the neighbourhood were a&s;&s;embled to celebrate it; that Mr. Martindale was at his county &s;eat in Cornwall, and that Lady Jane was gone off with Lord Darnley. Glencairn thanked his informer, and returned to his apartment. He had appointed a week from that day to go on board the &s;hip, and was determined to employ the whole of it in making enquiries after her. He flattered him&s;elf that it would be in his power to "recall the wanderer home;" and &s;hould he fail in the attempt, it was &s;till a laud|able one. He thought he &s;aw her de&s;titute of
<PB N="122" REF="030497_0121_0FE6F68D79BE64F8">
money, and of friends; and might he not &s;up|ply the place of both?&mdash;Yet, he again reflect|ed, was &s;he de&s;erving &s;uch attention from him, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ght he not to be with-held from &s;hewing it by his &s;acred engagement to Mary Stuart? The gentle, the virtuous, the faithful Mary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but, alas! the &s;econd place in his re|gard; he was more rivetted by honour, than he was bound by love.</P>
<P>The next morning, the Director favoured him with a vi&s;it, and in&s;i&s;ted on his dining with him. They talked of Colonel Stuart, and Glencairn &s;lightly touched on his engagement with his daughter; but as &s;everal gentlemen were pre&s;ent, many words did not pa&s;s on the &s;ubject. Glencairn drank freely of Cape and a variety of other wines. His life had hitherto been one continued &s;cene of &s;obriety, and it was not to be wondered at, in the pre&s;ent mo|ment, that the liquor &s;taggered his rea&s;on, and at length wholly overcame it. To this might be added the di&s;ordered &s;ituation of his mind, and both threw him into a &s;tate of temporary madne&s;s. He &s;tole away from the Director's hou&s;e, and went directly to Mr. Martindale's; where, on enquiring for Mrs. Drapery, he &s;oon gained admi&s;&s;ion. She immediately knew him; confirmed all he had heard; told him where to find Lady Jane; and fini&s;hed by &s;ay|ing that had he come &s;ooner to town, he would have probably had the preference over Lord Darnley.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hed as he was with wine, and inflamed

by the &s;ubject, he &s;carcely gave her time to fi|ni&s;h the &s;entence, ere he directed his wayward &s;teps towords Great Cumberland Street. No &s;ooner was the &s;treet door opened, than he im|petuou&s;ly ru&s;hed forward, and, without making any enquiry at Lady Jane's apartment, abrupt|ly entered it. She &s;tarted, and was terrified by his appearance, and received him with di&s;|tant civility. His pa&s;&s;ion knew no bounds. Love, jealou&s;y, and rage, were cou&s;picuous in his countenance; he called her <HI>infamous,</HI> and ungrateful, and vowed to be the death of Lord Darnley, if &s;he did not in&s;tantly con&s;ent to go off with him. At the word <HI>infamous,</HI> &s;he &s;huddered. Her &s;oul di&s;dained the menace, and the accu&s;er; yet &s;he was &s;tung by his ex|pre&s;&s;ions. Was that the language &s;he de&s;erved, or had been accu&s;tomed to?&mdash;Was there NO di&s;crimination? no more gentle epithet for a heart nearly broken by accumulated misfor|tunes, but which had plunged into an illegal, though almo&s;t unavoidable connection?&mdash;She had been thrown headlong down a precipice, and was now accu&s;ed, and reproaches, becau&s;e &s;he fell! Glencairn had not arrived time e|nough to &s;natch her from impending ruin; but he &s;eemed to triumph in her misfortune, and to take an unmanly advantage of it to in&s;ult her. She felt that her &s;ituation laid her open to the frowning cen&s;ures of the world, but he was the la&s;t per&s;on that &s;hould remind her of it. She had not rea&s;on to expect to meet with lenity from her female acquaintance, after the KIND le&s;&s;on Mi&s;s Fielding had taught her. Alas! were all the SEEMING virtuous charac|ters

<P>LADY Jane prevailed at length on Glen|cairn to retire; which however &s;he was not able to accompli&s;h till he had extorted from her a promi&s;e to con&s;ider of his propo&s;als, and to &s;end him a definitive an&s;wer to them in the morning. She al&s;o obtained his word, that he would not take any &s;teps again&s;t Lord Darn|ley which might interfere with her pre&s;ent &s;tate of negative peace, till &s;he had &s;ome farther con|ver&s;ation with him. But &s;he was relieved from all apprehen&s;ions of that kind early the next day by a few lines &s;he received from him, in which he bade her a long adieu. He a&s;&s;ured her that he felt the impropriety of which he had been guilty the proceeding evening, and he entreated her to forgive it, as with his rea|&s;on a proper &s;en&s;e of his duty had returned; and that le&s;t he &s;hould in another moment of involuntary inebriation be tempted to offend her again in the &s;ame manner, he had deter|mined on going on board the Melville Ca&s;tle that day; being re&s;olved to fulfill to the ut|mo&s;t the confidence repo&s;ed in him. He would willingly, he added, lo&s;e his life in her defence; but he owed the pre&s;ent pre&s;ervation of it to the intere&s;ts of Colonel Stuart, and his family; he was intru&s;ted by them with the depo&s;it of
<PB N="127" REF="030497_0126_0FE6F6A394A2DA28">
their future fortune; it was a &s;acred engage|ment, which, when once fulfilled, would leave him nothing to hope for, and nothing to fear.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort po&s;t&s;cript he added, that his de&s;ti|nation was to return to England as &s;oon as he had &s;een Mr. Stuart, and received his com|mands; when he would find out if po&s;&s;ible where &s;he re&s;ided, and in what &s;ituation. He concluded thus abrubtly, as if fearful of &s;aying more than he intended; yet it was ea&s;y to trace his bewildered mind in every line.</P>
<P>Lady Jane had certainly an attachment for Lord Darnley; but it was rather the compul&s;i|on of gratitude, than the effu&s;ion of love. She had lately ob&s;erved in him an air of con&s;traint, and &s;ometimes of moro&s;ene&s;s, that &s;he had not before perceived; yet &s;he con&s;idered it both her duty and inclination to apprize Lord Darn|ley of their interview. He pau&s;ed while &s;he related it; then &s;eeming &s;uddenly to recollect him&s;elf, advi&s;ed her if po&s;&s;ible to marry Glen|cairn. He did not, he &s;aid, mean to keep up the boyi&s;h farce of deceiving her; but he could not in honour to him&s;elf, or ju&s;tice to his daughter, marry her him&s;elf. His fortune &s;he knew was not large. Yet he could &s;pear out of it an annuity of one hundred pounds, which he would &s;ettle on her in addition to whatever allowance might be made her by Mr. Martin|dale, after the divorce bill had pa&s;&s;ed. She mu&s;t not, he added, expect to &s;ee him &s;o fre|quently as &s;he had hitherto done; it might
<PB N="128" REF="030497_0127_0FE6F6A3985D9068">
prevent his forming an HONOURABLE connecti|on, which he owed to the infancy and &s;ituation of his daughter.</P>
<P>Lady Jane li&s;tened to this &s;peech in &s;ilent a|&s;toni&s;hment; and, when it was over, ironical|ly thanked his lord&s;hip for the KINDNESS of his intentions; but a&s;&s;ured him that it was the la&s;t time &s;he would degrade her&s;elf by &s;eeing him. With an air of dignity, uncontaminated by pa&s;&s;ion of any kind, &s;he commanded him to re|tire, and never more to in&s;ult her either by his pre&s;ence, or his offers of mi&s;placed genero&s;i|ty, or wound her feelings by unmerited con|tempt. She was at lea&s;t his equal in point of rank; and in &s;entiment, far his &s;uperior. She loved the little Loui&s;a with almo&s;t the &s;ame maternal tenderne&s;s &s;he &s;hould have felt, had Heaven ble&s;&s;ed her with a child; but her pride had been too gro&s;sly in&s;ulted to allow her to give farther proofs of it. She repeated her wi&s;h of &s;eeing him no more, and with haughty, but determined re&s;olution, forbade him to intrude farther on her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Lord Darnley looked aba&s;hed, and mortifi|ed; he endeavoured to &s;tammer out an excu&s;e; but finding it would avail nothing, he made a low bow and withdrew.</P>
<P>In new, and alarming a&s;&s;aults of fortune, if there be lei&s;ure for reflection, the mind retires into its citadel; and there, rejecting every u&s;e|le&s;s or ordinary companion, admits alone tho&s;e rare energetic powers, who&s;e vigour can repel,
<PB N="129" REF="030497_0128_0FE6F6A4B79FB348">
or vigilance elude, the fury of the &s;torm. In &s;uch a dilemma, &s;he naturally thought of Glen|cairn; not as the future happy rival of Lord Darnley; not as her champion, whom &s;he might expect to find bold in his revenge of her injuries;&mdash;but, as a friendly divinity, who&s;e &s;oothing pity, if it could not di&s;&s;ipate, would at lea&s;t effu&s;e a &s;ympathetic balm. Yet it was not until after &s;ome &s;truggles that &s;he determined to write, and reque&s;t &s;eeing him once more; and di&s;patched Tom with a letter to that effect, to Black-wall.</P>
<P>He lo&s;t no time after receiving it in obeying her &s;ummons; and drew from her full a confe&s;&s;i|on of her intimacy with Lord Darnley, and his &s;ub&s;equent conduct. He &s;aid little in re|ply, but &s;oon after excu&s;ed him&s;elf on pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s which would detain him half an hour, and went directly to Lord Darnley's lodging, determined to demand &s;atisfaction for the ungentlemanly and cruel treatment that he had exerted towards an unhappy and unprotect|ed woman. His lord&s;hip having probably en|tertained &s;ome &s;u&s;picions on that head, had paid off his lodgings, and left town an hour before Glencairn arrived there.</P>
<P>Cruelty and cowardice are &s;o clo&s;ely connect|ed, as to be deemed almo&s;t in&s;eparable. The man who would wantonly torture and de&s;troy even the lea&s;t of God's creatures, will be &s;eldom found to po&s;&s;e&s;s that degree of courage which naturally belongs to the Lord of the creation, and which habitual vice only can do away.
<PB N="130" REF="030497_0129_0FE6F6A4C0595EE8">
He will tyrannize over tho&s;e unhappy victims whom the chance of fortune has rendered &s;ub|&s;ervient to his power; but he will &s;hrink from tho&s;e who can reign over HIM, and &s;tand agha&s;t at the appearance of &s;uperior virtue. A man of real courage is a man of &s;trict honour; he will, like the tried warrior, pity, and releave as far as he is able, the le&s;s fortunate vanqui&s;hed; but he will de&s;pi&s;e the pitiful prerogative of exult|ing over, and adding to, accumulated woes. Such were the oppo&s;ite characters of lord Darn|ley, and Glencairn.</P>
<P>In two days more the Melville-Ca&s;tle was to go down the river; and Glencairn's engage|ments were of too &s;erious a nature to be broken. He &s;aid nothing to Lady Jane of his knowledge of Lord Darnley's departure; but reque&s;ted her to per&s;evere in not &s;eeing him; and advi|&s;ed her to retire to &s;ome more private lodging, where &s;he might wait the i&s;&s;ue of the matter now pending in law. He told her that he ho|ped to return to England in fifteen or eighteen months; and he begged her not to forget that &s;he had one friend left, who would never de&s;ert her intere&s;ts, though the &s;acrifice of his ever|la&s;ting peace mu&s;t be made to the memory of her &s;ufferings, and his own feeble condition. With the&s;e words he left her, but ah, in what a &s;itu|ation!&mdash;no friends, no &s;ociety, not even an acquaintance to whom &s;he might pour out her griefs and her mind di&s;turbed almo&s;t beyond the powers of reflection! Towards evening &s;he walked out, and her &s;teps were involuntari|ly directed towards Brompton. She would
<PB N="131" REF="030497_0130_0FE6F6AECD367240">
have pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e which contained M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> Darnley; but by accident &s;he looked up, and &s;aw her playing in her nur&s;e's arms, at the window. She was then about eight months old. Lady Jane could not re&s;i&s;t the temptati|on; but running eagerly up &s;tairs; ki&s;&s;ed her with ardent affection, while the tears &s;tream|ed down her cheeks. The object of her walk was to find out a cheap lodging in a decent fa|mily; in this &s;he &s;oon &s;ucceeded, and took it from the following day.</P>
<P>She returned home, and was &s;itting over a &s;lender &s;upper, rapt in melancholly ideas, when a loud knock at the &s;treet-door, and a hackney&punc; coach &s;topping at it, arre&s;ted her attention. Tom informed her that it was an old gentle|man, who declined &s;ending up his name, but particularly reque&s;ted to &s;ee her. She was in that &s;tate of torpid in&s;en&s;ibility which renders us alike indifferent to every thing, and &s;he gave orders that he &s;hould be admitted. This unex|pected vi&s;itor was old Mr. Martindale; at &s;ight of him her tears flowed afre&s;h, but he bade her be comforted. Nothing, he &s;aid, that lay within HIS power &s;hould be wanting to &s;often the rigour of her de&s;tiny. He had called to a&s;&s;ure her of it; and would repeat his vi&s;its, though he wi&s;hed his family might re|main ignorant of them. The &s;ettlement, he &s;aid, of two thou&s;and pounds per annum that had been made on her marriage, and was to de&s;cend to her in ca&s;e &s;he &s;urvived her hu&s;band, would &s;till hold good if there was no divorce, and that &s;he refu&s;ed to &s;ign any bond that might
<PB N="132" REF="030497_0131_0FE6F6AED1E4DB38">
be propo&s;ed to her, till &s;he had been advi&s;ed how to act. His &s;on had been already inform|ed by his coun&s;el, that there did not exi&s;t any ju&s;t plea for a divorce; and he was determined not only to appri&s;e her of what &s;he ought to do, but al&s;o from time to time acquaint her with what &s;teps were to be taken, and his opinion of them. He &s;taid with her near an hour; and promi&s;ing to call on her next evening at Brompton, took his leave of her with every ap|pearance of pity and regard.</P>
<P>She received the next morning a long con&s;o|latory letter from Glencairn; but as it contain|ed nothing more than a repetition of his friend|&s;hip and good wi&s;hes, we will not tran&s;cribe it; but take for the pre&s;ent our leave of him, wi&s;h|ing him a pro&s;perous voyage to India, and a &s;afe and happy return to Britain.</P>
<P>Mr. Martindale went as he had promi&s;ed to Brompton; and &s;aid he was authori&s;ed by his &s;on to make known to her in what manner he cho&s;e, that he &s;hould henceforwards continue to allow her one hundred pounds per annum; and that he had given orders to his banker to pay her immediately five hundred pounds, as a pre|&s;ent from him&s;elf. She had hitherto thought of, and now cared, &s;o little about pecuniary mat|ters, that &s;he was perfectly &s;atisfied with his propo&s;al to execute a deed of &s;eparation, that &s;hould preclude the po&s;&s;ibility of her debts falling on her hu&s;band. This was agreed on, and &s;igned by both parties the following day, and every thing appeared to be terminated to

<P>FROM the time of Glencairn's departure, Mi&s;s Stuart's health began to relap&s;e into its former &s;tate of declining &s;trength. Fre|quent faintings, lo&s;s of appetite, and a total de|jection of &s;pirits, were the alarming fore-run|ners of what was &s;oon confirmed to be a rapid decline. The Colonel and her&s;elf received &s;e|veral letters from him, and in the la&s;t, dated from the Downs, he took his long farewell. But the&s;e, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;uaging her grief at his lo&s;s, vi&s;ibly augmented it. She perceived a chilly re&s;erve in his manner of addre&s;&s;ing her, that was incon&s;i&s;tent &s;he thought with the na|ture of their engagement; and his &s;ilence re|&s;pecting Lady Jane Martindale (an account of whom they had &s;een in the papers) was to Ma|ry the &s;ure&s;t proof of his not being indifferent about it. In a few weeks Mr. Courtenay be|came their vi&s;itor; but knowing the &s;ituation of her heart, he dropped all preten&s;ions to be her lover, and gloried but in the title of her &s;incere and &s;ympathizing friend. He divided with the Colonel his attentions to her; and his naturally cheerful di&s;po&s;ition often forced a &s;mile from her pale and placid countenance,
<PB N="134" REF="030497_0133_0FE6F6B15CDD57E0">
while it &s;econded the anxious wi&s;hes of her ve|nerable father, by &s;ometimes enabling him to a&s;&s;ume an air of gaiety from which his heart was very far removed.</P>
<P>Many months pa&s;&s;ed in which their hours were thus uniformly, and not unplea&s;ingly di|vided. The Colonel and Mr. Courtenay ge|nerally rode out; and when the cold was not too &s;evere (for it was now winter) Mi&s;s Stu|art frequently accompanied them behind a &s;er|vant, for &s;he was too weak to venture alone on hor&s;e-back. They had one morning in the month of December extended their ride beyond its u&s;ual bounds, when they were overtaken by a &s;udden &s;torm. The hail&s;tones pelted them with fury, and thick flakes of &s;now fell in a|bundance over them. They found them&s;elves nine miles from Allanbank, and were obliged to take &s;helter in a &s;mall cottage, till they could di&s;patch their attendant to the neare&s;t town where a chai&s;e might be procured, and which was at a much greater di&s;tance. They did not reach home till near &s;even o'clock in the even|ing, and the &s;torm had not yet abated.</P>
<P>They had but ju&s;t changed their wet clothes, and were &s;itting round the blazing fire, wait|ing their early &s;upper, when <HI>Keeper,</HI> the faith|ful hou&s;e-dog, announced by his loud barking, the unu&s;ual appproach of vi&s;itors. He was &s;oon echoed by &s;everal other dogs, who&s;e peaceful &s;lumbers he had di&s;turbed, as they lay &s;tretched round the comfortable hearth of the ho&s;pitable parlour. The rain pattered again&s;t
<PB N="135" REF="030497_0134_0FE6F6B9CAF1B260">
the windows, and the wind loud whi&s;tled through the trees, which hardly &s;uffered them to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the rattling of carriage wheels, till it ap|proached clo&s;e to the outward gate. Mary's heart fir&s;t bounded high with fluttering expec|tation, and then &s;unk with dire di&s;may.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Allanbank &s;oon a&s;&s;embled at the door; from whence, after a &s;hort interval of painful &s;u&s;pence, they could perceive, by the glimmering light of the different candles they held, a female form, which, lightly tripping up the lawn, was enquiring of every one &s;he &s;aw, whether Mi&s;s Stuart was there? On be|ing an&s;wered in the affirmative, &s;he flew to her embrace, and, without giving Mary time to recollect her&s;elf, a&s;ked her if &s;he had quite for|gotten her old friend, Sophia Beaumont?</P>
<P>Mary drew back with fear, as thinking &s;he beheld her gho&s;t; for how could mother St. Etienne, a confirmed nun of one of the &s;tricte&s;t orders in France, be not only liberated from her confinement, but al&s;o a &s;olitary wanderer in a remote part of a kingdom to which &s;he was an entire &s;tranger? A moment's pau&s;e con|vinced her; and that moment drew a tear of blood from her heart, as it brought to her re|membrance the &s;ituation of <HI>per&s;ecuted France!</HI> that country in which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the happie&s;t hours of uncon&s;cious infancy; where &s;he had &s;o often witne&s;&s;ed the gay dance, the fe&s;tive board, the jocund &s;ong, and all the &s;prightly attributes of light-footed felicity. Alas! how &s;ad, how bitter, how &s;udden,
<PB N="136" REF="030497_0135_0FE6F6B9CEA02018">
how heart-breaking, was now the va&s;t re|ver&s;e!</P>
<P>Mary welcomed her friend with unfeigned &s;atisfaction, and when &s;upper was over, Mi&s;s Beaumont began her pathetic narration. She dwelt with pity on the violation of every &s;acred in&s;titution. The Catholic religion, who&s;e out|ward forms pourtrayed the exce&s;s of romantic &s;uper&s;tition, now &s;tood unma&s;ked, and terrible to view. The &s;avage chiefs of France, who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ands were perpetually employed in &s;hedding without mercy the blood of innocents, had laid low the buildings that were devoted to the &s;er|vice of God, and at length dared to deny his name. Nor did &s;he forget (while the tear of pity &s;treamed down her cheeks, and down tho&s;e of her auditors) the holy &s;i&s;terhood of her now violated, but once &s;acred, a&s;ylum. Tho&s;e aged and venerable nuns, who&s;e life had been &s;pent within its quiet walls, and who, devoted &s;ince childhood to their religion, had peaceably and uniformly fulfilled its duties, were now torn by the rough hand of violence from their &s;olitary cells, and expo&s;ed to buffet with the &s;torms of a world they had never &s;een, and of which they had coveted only A GRAVE!</P>
<P>The great clock &s;truck twelve; and, by re|minding them of the latene&s;s of the hour, re|lea&s;ed the compa&s;&s;ionate hearts under the roof at Allanbank from dwelling farther on the me|lancholy tale; and Mi&s;s Beaumont, fatigued by her long journey, was glad to retire as &s;oon as &s;he had &s;atisfied them of the means which brought her thither. An Engli&s;h family to
<PB N="137" REF="030497_0136_0FE6F6BC4440DE00">
whom &s;he was unknown had conducted her by the way of Oftend to London, and &s;upplied her with money more than &s;ufficient to defray her expences to Scotland. This charming girl, though French by birth, was calculated to a|dorn human nature; her heart recoiled at the horrors exerci&s;ed by her ferocious countrymen, horrors &s;o great they want a name, and beggar all de&s;cription!</P>

<P>IT would be difficult to meet with minds more perfectly congenial than were tho&s;e of Mary Stuart and Sophia Beaumont. They were charmed with the &s;ociety of each other, yet Mi&s;s Beaumont's delicacy was wounded by her being wholly dependent on her friends. From this motive &s;he wi&s;hed, after a few months re&s;idence at Allanbank, to remove from it till &s;uch time as &s;he might be able to with|draw her &s;lender fortune out of the hands of her family. She was an adept at all kinds of needle-work, and thought it might be practica|ble for her to gain a maintenance at Edin|burgh; but Mi&s;s Stuart's precarious &s;tate of health would not permit her to hint at it. She was every day &s;omewhat weaker than the for|mer one; yet with that flattering hope which is almo&s;t con&s;tantly attendant on her fatal di&s;or|der, &s;he derived the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of her recovery with the approaching &s;pring. Mi&s;s Beaumont and Mr. Courtenay were inde|fatigably attentive to her; but the Colonel was too well aware of her danger, not to &s;tand him&s;elf in need of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance he endeavour|ed to give his dying daughter.</P>
<P>Let &s;toicks enjoy their frigid in&s;en&s;ibility,

and philo&s;ophers boa&s;t the command of pa&s;&s;ions they never felt; but where is the heart endued with NATURAL TENDERNESS, that could have refrained &s;ympathizing with Mi&s;s Beau|mont in her feelings for her friend?&mdash;Courte|nay's could not. His admiration of her amia|ble di&s;po&s;ition, which was &s;o feelingly di&s;play|ed on this melancholy occa&s;ion, led him by de|grees to a more tender &s;entiment, which he had &s;ome rea&s;on to think did not remain long unnoticed by the lovely Sophia.</P>
<P>It was an union that Mi&s;s Stuart ardently wi&s;hed; and the deep blu&s;hes which had once over&s;pread Mi&s;s Beaumont's face on hearing his name inadvertently mentioned, confirmed her in the opinion &s;he had formed of their mu|tual attachment. I have already &s;aid that Mr. Courtenay po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable fortune in Ireland; but his generous &s;oul di&s;dained the idea of hoarding money, and it was not unu&s;ual for him to exceed the bounds of his income by deeds of charity and benevolence. He was at this time about fifty years of age; and had ram|bled &s;ufficiently about the world, to wi&s;h to be at length quietly &s;ettled in it. He had partly determined on going to Ireland for that pur|po&s;e, when he &s;aw Mi&s;s Beaumont. His pa&s;|&s;ion for Mi&s;s Stuart had worn away in propor|tion as his hopes of being united to her dimi|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Stuart &s;ent for him one morning into her dre&s;&s;ing-room; and taking from a drawer a miniature of her&s;elf that had been done in Italy
<PB N="140" REF="030497_0139_0FE6F6C6D2145B60">
(and which, contrary to her expectation, Glen|cairn had not a&s;ked for at his departure), pre|&s;ented it to him. She reque&s;ted that he would give it to Mi&s;s Beaumont; adding, that &s;he was greatly mi&s;taken in her conjectures if &s;he did not receive it with additional &s;atisfaction from his hands.</P>
<P>This &s;peech was too flattering to the wi&s;hes of Mr. Courtenay, to be mi&s;under&s;tood by him. His next care, after giving the picture as de&s;ir|ed, was to open his mind to Colonel Stuart, and to repeat to him what had pa&s;&s;ed. The young ladies had already come to an explanati|on on the &s;ubject; and before evening it was re&s;olved on, with the hearty concurrence of all parties, that Mr. Courtenay &s;hould receive the hand of Sophia.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than three weeks he had made an ho|nourable &s;ettlement on his fair intended; and &s;oon after, the marriage was &s;olemnized. Mi&s;s Stuart in&s;i&s;ted on being pre&s;ent at the ceremo|ny, but fainted before it was over, and was with difficulty conveyed from the church to her chamber. Her heart rejoiced at the happine&s;s of her friend: but it brought &s;ad recollections to her mind, and was near &s;ubduing the little &s;trength that was left her. Mr. Courtenay hi|red a &s;mall hou&s;e that was fortunately vacant in the neighbourhood of Allanbank, as they were determined not to leave Mi&s;s Stuart till the curtain of death had been gently drawn o|ver the la&s;t &s;cene of her exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="030497_0140_0FE6F6C80C4BA4E0">They had been &s;ettled there about ten months, and Mrs. Courtenay's &s;ituation was &s;uch as to require every precaution and care that a fond hu&s;band, and anxious friend, could be&s;tow on it, when it unfortunately happened that &s;he was one evening &s;itting with Mi&s;s Stuart in her apartment, and the London new&s;papers arrived. Mrs. Courtenay opened them, and began to read; but had not proceed|ed far, when &s;he &s;aw the words Melville Ca&s;tle. Eager to &s;atisfy her own impatience, and that of her unhappy friend, &s;he began to go through the paragraph; but &s;topped in the middle of it, gave a loud &s;cream, and fell in hy&s;terics on the floor. Her cries &s;oon brought the &s;ervants up &s;tairs, who were followed by the Colonel and Mr. Courtenay. The fatal my&s;tery was in|&s;tantly revealed; the alarming paragraph &s;tat|ed that the Melville Ca&s;tle was arrived &s;afe at Madras; but that a boat belonging to her had &s;unk at the entrance of the harbour, and that all the per&s;ons on board had unfortunately pe|ri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Stuart di&s;played the mo&s;t heroic forti|tude on this occa&s;ion; her fears for her friend &s;uper&s;eded every &s;elfi&s;h pang, and &s;he &s;eemed to &s;oar above mortality. She &s;hed no tears, but &s;weetly &s;miled as Mrs. Courtenay recover|ed, and even endeavoured to per&s;uade them that &s;he had a pre&s;entiment of Glencairn's not being of the number of tho&s;e unhappy pa&s;&s;en|gers. A premature delivery, and the death of her child, were the only ill con&s;equences that befel Mrs. Courtenay; and which, by detain|ing

her at Allanbank, was not unaccompanied by con&s;olation to Mi&s;s Stuart, who was too ill to vi&s;it at her hou&s;e, and derived her greate&s;t comfort on attending her, in a room adjoining to her own. Mrs Courtenay &s;oon recovered; but it was to witne&s;s a &s;cene which, though &s;he had long expected, &s;he was ill prepared for. Mi&s;s Stuart found her&s;elf one day &s;o much better, that &s;he reque&s;ted they would all indulge her by dining in her room. She had dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to receive, as &s;he &s;aid, her vi&s;itors, with unu&s;ual care. When dinner was over, &s;he de&s;ired Mr. Courtenay to lead her to the piano-forte; when faintly touching the di&s;cordant &s;trings, &s;he endeavoured to go through her fa|vourite air,
<Q>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</Q>
which &s;he attempted to accompany with her voice; but her &s;trength failed in the attempt, and &s;he &s;unk motionle&s;s on the chair. When &s;he came to her&s;elf, &s;he affectingly took a hand of her father's, and repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips. She then for the fir&s;t time acknowledged to them all, that &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of her ap|proaching di&s;&s;olution. She begged the Colonel would comply with her reque&s;t, and, in ca&s;e of Glencairn's returning to England, that he would make him his heir; &s;aying, &s;he could not die in peace unle&s;s &s;he obtained the promi&s;e of that which lay neare&s;t to her heart. In half-broken &s;entences he a&s;&s;ured her of it, and bade her be comforted.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="030497_0142_0FE6F6D1CBED96C0">Towards evening &s;he begged of Mr. Courte|nay to read prayers to her, and de&s;ired that all the &s;ervants might be called up &s;tairs to join in the pious &s;cene.

But when her father drew near; when &s;he felt his arms clinging round her wai&s;t, as if to &s;hield her from the tyrant who was advancing with ha&s;ty &s;teps to &s;eparate them for ever, &s;he faintly articulated the word <HI>farewell;</HI> her head &s;unk on his bo&s;om, and with a deep and heavy &s;igh <HI>&s;he expired!</HI></P>

<P>MRS. Courtenay re&s;igned to her hu&s;band the melancholy office of con&s;oling the afflicted Colonel, who vainly endeavoured to reconcile him&s;elf to the &s;ad &s;eparation. He however derived comfort from the idea that it could not be of long duration, for he felt that he &s;hould not long &s;urvive his Mary. He took a mournful plea&s;ure in decorating her &s;en&s;ele&s;s cor&s;e with &s;uch flowers as his humble green-hou&s;e could &s;upply. He watched the &s;ad proce&s;&s;ion as it moved from the hou&s;e; at the head of it, was the faithful M'Kenzie, bending her pal&s;ied frame towards the earth in &s;peechle&s;s woe. Mr. Courtenay &s;upported her; nor did his manly countenance lo&s;e &s;ight of its dignity while over&s;pread with the tears of affection and &s;ympathy. Eight young Highland girls bore the precious burden to its de&s;tined home; and the &s;olemn &s;cene was conducted with that &s;ilent awe which intermingles it&s;elf with pious re&s;ig|nation to the in&s;crutable will of Heaven.</P>
<P>The ceremony over, the mourners return|ed; and by degrees, Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay left Colonel Stuart's hou&s;e to inhabit once more their own. Yet they continued as one family, and omitted nothing that could tend towards
<PB N="145" REF="030497_0144_0FE6F6D2E6021658">
alleviating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their venerable friend. But this care was not long allotted them. In a few weeks, Colonel Stuart entreat|ed them to give up their hou&s;e, and to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Allanbank; con&s;idering it as their depo&s;it till, by the unavoidable arrangement of his affairs, it might hereafter become nece&s;&s;ary, through Glencairn's return, for them to re|linqui&s;h it.</P>
<P>He &s;oon after made his will, and di&s;po&s;ed of every thing as his daughter had directed; allot|ting only &s;ome trifling legacies to Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay; a &s;mall but &s;ufficient annuity to Mrs. M'Kenzie; and remembrances to his other dome&s;tics in proportion to their age and &s;ervices. He farther &s;tipulated, that in ca&s;e of Glencairn's death without i&s;&s;ue, his whole pro|perty was to devolve to Mrs. Courtenay, and HER heirs for ever. The bu&s;ine&s;s of life being finally &s;ettled, the excellent Colonel Stuart re|&s;igned his breath, while glorifying his Redeem|er that had heard his prayer, and was going to re&s;tore him to his Mary.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay remained in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Allanbank. Exemplary patterns of dome&s;tic felicity, they had already pa&s;&s;ed three years there; during which Heaven ble&s;&s;ed them with two children; nor did they know a day's &s;eparation, till Mr. Courtenay went to Ireland for &s;ix weeks, on bu&s;ine&s;s relative to his own affairs. His amiable Sophia refu&s;ed all &s;ociety but that of her children and the worthy M'Kenzie; who being now too old to interfere
<PB N="146" REF="030497_0145_0FE6F6D2EB654890">
in hou&s;ehold management, was become her con&s;tant companion. They could not hear of Glencairn, though they had u&s;ed every endea|vour to know his fate, on the return of the Melville Ca&s;tle. All they could di&s;cover, was, that he was not of the number of the drowned pa&s;&s;engers in the boat. They had landed him at Madras; and from their not ha|ving received any tidings of him &s;ince, they concluded that he was either removed to &s;ome more di&s;tant part of India, or died &s;oon after his arrival there. But they did not appropriate any part of his intended fortune to their own u&s;e; they &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavoured to accumu|late, and enjoyed the plea&s;ing, di&s;intere&s;ted hope, that &s;till exi&s;ted, of his return to the full enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>Let us now revert to the ill-treated Lady Jane Martindale; who, hurried progre&s;&s;ively from one fal&s;e &s;tep to another, found many Lord Darnleys, but few friends. Old Mar|tindale frequently vi&s;ited her; but &s;hocking to relate! &s;oon convinced her, by his propo&s;als, of the depravity of his mind. He told her that her future fortune was in his hands, and that he would provide for, or for&s;ake her, accor|ding to her treatment of him. He que&s;tioned her as to the &s;tate of her pre&s;ent finances; and on finding that her thoughtle&s;s extravagance had reduced them to the lowe&s;t ebb, he threw a fifty pound not on the table, and endeavour|ed to extort from horror and fear, a &s;acrifice that in a generous brea&s;t mu&s;t be ever &s;acred to love alone.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="030497_0146_0FE654EE91654EE0">Fallen as &s;he already was in her own e&s;teem, and in that of others, &s;he yet could not hear a &s;entiment &s;o degrading to humanity, without feeling a mixture of terror and &s;urpri&s;e. Though reduced to the la&s;t exigences, &s;he would fain have returned the note to its de&s;picable owner: but he in&s;i&s;ted on leaving it; and, &s;hewing evident &s;ymptoms of di&s;appointment and confu|&s;ion, &s;oon after took his leave.</P>
<P>Lady Jane gave her&s;elf up a prey to inward de&s;pair, and outward di&s;&s;ipation. While the tears ro&s;e in crim&s;on torrents from her heart, &s;he wildly decorated her per&s;on with the in&s;ig|nies of joy; and &s;ought a tran&s;itory relief in fal&s;e plea&s;ures, while &s;he continued to be a &s;tranger to every real one. The doors that &s;heltered virtue, were clo&s;ely barred again&s;t her approach; tho&s;e of vice, only, &s;tood upon to receive her. In every new lover, &s;he &s;ought a friend; in every new lover, &s;he gained an enemy. She had heard of Mi&s;s Stuart's death, but to Glencairn's fate &s;he was wholly indiffer|ent. Several weeks elap&s;ed without her hear|ing any thing more of old Mr. Martindale; and &s;o invincible was her pre&s;ent aver&s;ion to him, that although from motives of prudence &s;he was with-held from publickly expo&s;ing him, &s;he rejoiced at her deliverance from the &s;ight of &s;o unworthy, &s;o unprincipled a relati|on.</P>
<P>She was one day waited on by an elderly gentleman, who&s;e appearance prejudiced her warmly in his favour. He &s;poke the language
<PB N="148" REF="030497_0147_0FE6F6DD18FD3F50">
of pity, and of friendly advice; &s;ounds to which &s;he had been long unaccu&s;tomed. After the nece&s;&s;ary introduction, he informed her that Mr. Martindale, &s;enior, died &s;uddenly two days before, in an apoplectic fit, and that his will had been that morning read&punc; a codicil was found to have been lately added to it, by which he ratified to Lady Jane the enjoyment of the two thou&s;and pounds per annum, in ca&s;e of her &s;urviving her hu&s;band; but that he had not bequeathed her, for temporary &s;upplies, any legacy whatever.</P>
<P>Lady Jane cared &s;o little about worldly con|cerns, that &s;he heard of this di&s;appointment without the lea&s;t di&s;compo&s;ure. Her mind had now yielded to that &s;tate of hurried perplexity, that did not allow her time to reflect on all the mi&s;eries attending her haple&s;s &s;ituation. She had taken an elegant hou&s;e in town; and its expences were uncea&s;ingly defrayed by the di|vers &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to her attention. All inter|cour&s;e between her and the little Loui&s;a Darn|ley had been long &s;ince prohibited by the un|feeling lord; who, callous to misfortunes of which he had been a principle author, now wantonly regarded her, wherever he met her, with the piercing look of ineffable contempt. The affection &s;he once bore him was totally ob|literated; and &s;he could meet him and Mi&s;s Fielding together, which was not unu&s;ual&punc; be|holding them with the &s;ame degree of contempt which they did not fail manife&s;ting towards her upon every occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="030497_0148_0FE6F6DE295C8040">A black coach, and all the outward trappings of woe, were the tokens by which &s;he &s;oon de&s;cried Mrs. Martindale; who daily paraded the Park and Bond-&s;treet with all the &s;olemnity of DECENT widowhood. To this was oppo&s;ed the gaudy equipage of Lady Darnley, late Mi&s;s Fielding; but this did not excite in the brea&s;t of Lady Jane, one &s;en&s;ation of &s;orrow, envy, or &s;urpri&s;e. Her feelings were howe|ver powerfully affected by a premeditated in&s;ult &s;he received from Lady Darnley, a few days after her marriage; who having &s;topped her carriage one morning at a &s;hop in Bond-&s;treet, was &s;peaking to one of the people at the coach door, when Lady Jane pa&s;&s;ed by. Mi&s;s Darn|ley was with her, and eagerly called to Lady Jane; when Lady Darnley &s;uddenly drew the &s;pring blind, to prevent her enjoying the &s;len|der &s;atisfaction of even looking at her.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Martindale did not long remain a widow. Ere the long twelvemonth was expired, during which it was nece&s;&s;ary for her to &s;ubmit to the doleful attire, and to put up with a corner of one of her drawing room windows being darkened by a hatchment, &s;he made a promi&s;e that when once the happy peri|od arrived, &s;he would be&s;tow her hand on a more &s;uitable lover than &s;he had found in her old man. Captain O'Trigger, who&s;e commi&s;|&s;ion centered in a da&s;hing cockade, had paraded his ponies about the city of Bath during &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons. But, though the gaming tables were in general propitious to him, the cho&s;en &s;ocie|ties were not &s;o. The mi&s;&s;es all vowed, that Captain O'Trigger was the fine&s;t fellow in Bath; but the mammas and guardians gave him &s;o little encouragement, that the Captain at length thought it be&s;t to beat a precipitate retreat, and try his &s;ucce&s;s in London. He was a fine, tall, hand&s;ome looking man; neat, but prepo&s;terous in his dre&s;s, and fond to a de|gree of his per&s;on. No man knew better than him&s;elf the names of all the different e&s;&s;ences and pomatums imported from India and France. From the powerful otto of ro&s;es, down to the more reviving, but more humble lavender wa|ter,
<PB N="151" REF="030497_0150_0FE6F6E724169620">
his dre&s;&s;ing-room was the repo&s;itory of them all; which, together with his ponies, a few fans from Italy, and &s;ome pots of rouge warranted vegetable (the two latter articles he re&s;erved for the happy fair on whom he might hereafter fix his choice,) compo&s;ed the whole &s;tock in trade of this FASHIONABLE MILITARY HERO.</P>
<P>Captain O'Trigger, who&s;e mode&s;ty was not in the habit of laying any embargo on his in|clinations, no &s;ooner beheld our young widow, and was informed who &s;he was, than he deter|mined to lay clo&s;e &s;iege to her; and as an ad|vantageous marriage was the fir&s;t grand object of his pur&s;uit, he was re&s;olved to transform his character into exactly any one that he might find on father enquiry would be mo&s;t likely to determine her in his favour.</P>
<P>He began to try the whole battery of his ar|tillery again&s;t the vain Mrs. Martindale; fir&s;t, by the aid of a &s;mall gla&s;s, &s;u&s;pended to a black ribbon, and dangling from his neck; with which he a&s;&s;ailed her wherever &s;he went; while the expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>a damned fine woman!</HI> was uttered JUST loud enough to catch her ear. At fir&s;t &s;he thought his accents favoured rather too much of the brogue; but at length cu&s;tom reconciled her to him, and &s;he hazarded not ere long to avow a di&s;tingui&s;hed preference to Captain O'Trigger over the re&s;t of his com|petitors,</P>
<P>He &s;oon became the acknowledged intended
<PB N="152" REF="030497_0151_0FE6F6E727F03670">
of the beautiful widow; not that &s;he cared for him in her heart, but her vanity was gratified at the idea of mortifying her rivals, whom her opinion had magnified into a much greater number than even Captain O'Trigger him&s;elf could lay rea&s;onably any claim to.</P>
<P>The la&s;t few weeks of Mrs. Martindale's funeral appearance were dedicated to preparati|ons for her approaching nuptials; on the &s;trength of which, her favourite Captain was enabled to cut a much greater figure than be|fore. A &s;umptuous vis a-vis was building at Hatchett's, by HIS expre&s;s order; and in which his ta&s;te &s;hone con&s;picuous. She was per|fectly convinced of the &s;incere attachment of this <HI>Knight of Indu&s;try,</HI> and in giving him her hand, be&s;towed on him al&s;o her OWN hou&s;e in Devon&s;hire-place; and every appendage of lux|ury &s;he parted with in his favour, with as lit|tle difficulty as &s;he her&s;elf had formerly obtain|ed them.</P>
<P>For &s;ome months the torch of Hymen blazed with unremitting ardour; but the in&s;tability of human happine&s;s &s;oon overpowered, and at length wholly extingui&s;hed it. Mrs. Martin|dale (now Mrs. O'Trigger) was fatally con|vinced that &s;he was the dupe of a de&s;igning for|tune-hunter; for &s;uch in reality was her cho&s;en mate.</P>
<P>It would be needle&s;s to detail the many oc|currences which led to the &s;ad rever&s;e of for|tune &s;he was henceforward fated to undergo.
<PB N="153" REF="030497_0152_0FE6F6E9B404A680">
Her hu&s;band's extravagance manife&s;ted it&s;elf at the gaming-tables, and el&s;ewhere. Her mo|ney &s;heltered him from a goal, but its &s;ource was not inexhau&s;tible; and &s;he had no &s;ooner deprived her&s;elf of every future comfort, for his pre&s;ervation, than he left her to lament her error in ob&s;curity and poverty. Captain O'Trigger, after &s;elling her hou&s;e and all &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;t of, at length wholly de&s;erted her; and the only account &s;he ever after received of him was that of his having returned to a for|mer wife in Ireland, with whom he had fled to &s;ome di&s;tant clime, far beyond the reach of law, ju&s;tice, honour, or humanity.</P>
<P>Lady Jane Martindale continued for a time to run the giddy round of thoughtle&s;s di&s;&s;ipati|on; but her heart, that had ever unwillingly yielded to its dictates, was &s;oon tired of its tran|&s;ient gratifications, and &s;ighed after the hum|ble &s;cenes of peaceful retirement. But the&s;e, alas! were no longer within the boundary of her own acqui&s;ition. She had no friend to &s;up|port her tottering &s;teps; no &s;oothing hand was &s;tretched forth to yield her comfort; no con&s;o|latory parental voice remained to welcome her out of the path of vice, She was, as it were, left alone in the va&s;t univer&s;e; the &s;mall &s;alary allotted her by Mr. Martindale &s;he duly re|ceived; and hitherto temporary additions to it from her acquaintance had not failed her; but &s;he knew the&s;e could not la&s;t long, and &s;he had acquired experience enough to teach her that they would exi&s;t no longer than &s;he was inclin|ed
<PB N="154" REF="030497_0153_0FE6F6E9B9875F08">
to &s;acrifice her happine&s;s to the enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, &s;he had already continued &s;ome years, anxious to exchange it, yet not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing re&s;olution enough to effect it, when &s;he was one morning &s;urpri&s;ed by the appear|ance of Glencairn. He was &s;o much altered in per&s;on, that &s;he had at fir&s;t &s;ome difficulty to recollect him; but his heart was the &s;ame. He had already been in Scotland, where he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Colonel Stuart's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">tate; &s;till in&s;i&s;ting, that Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay &s;hould not quit Allanbank. His voyage to India had not been pro&s;perous. Mr. Stuart's affairs were, when he arrived there, in &s;o deranged a &s;itua|tion, that, at his death, which happened &s;oon afterwards, they were found to be little worth the trouble that had been taken on their ac|count; and he was at length obliged to aban|don them, after having obtained but a very &s;lender advantage in favour of his friend and patron. But the re&s;idue of Colonel Stuart's fortune was yet more than &s;ufficient to an&s;wer any purpo&s;e of his own. He had liberality of &s;entiment &s;ufficient to make every allowance in favour of Lady Jane Martindale's mi&s;taken conduct; and while he could yet entertain the hope of making HER happy, the prai&s;e, or the cen&s;ure of an ill-judging world were to him e|qually indifferent.</P>
<P>He prevailed on her to accompany him to Edinburgh, where &s;he &s;oon convinced him that the genuine uprightne&s;s of her heart had
<PB N="155" REF="030497_0154_0FE6F6F3E907D090">
remained uncontaminated by <HI>fa&s;hionable levity.</HI> Nor was &s;he long there, before, by her admi&s;|&s;ion into a re&s;pectable family, and the delicate caution ob&s;erved by Glencairn in his vi&s;its to her, &s;he gained that countenance and re&s;pect which had been wrenched from her in England by the iron hand of cruelty, inju&s;tice, and op|pre&s;&s;ion. Not a year had pa&s;&s;ed after this hap|py tran&s;ition, before the death of Mr. Mar|tindale, by liberating her from the mo&s;t &s;acred, and mo&s;t abu&s;ed of engagements, enabled her to be&s;tow her hand, and large encrea&s;e of for|tune, on him who had &s;o nobly de&s;erved them. The amiable Mrs. Courtenay &s;hone forth on this occa&s;ion the bright repre&s;entative of SPOT|LESS virtue. She knew how to pity tho&s;e er|rors &s;he had never known; and tho&s;e tempta|tions which, as &s;he &s;weetly, &s;aid, &s;he might not have been able to have with&s;tood, had fate dealt by her with the &s;ame &s;everity it had done towards Lady Jane Martindale. The pomp of widowhood would have been but ill di&s;played by that hitherto unfortunate lady. She neither affected the weeds of &s;orrow, nor the trophies of joy; but with all the decorum due to her|&s;elf, and to tho&s;e with whom &s;he was now &s;o happily connected &s;he &s;urrendered, as &s;oon as decency would permit, the name of <HI>Martindale,</HI> and became entitled to the more happy one of <HI>Glencairn.</HI></P>

his un&s;haken fidelity. Lady Jane proved her|&s;elf the woman of honor and gratitude, by the con&s;tant rectitude and unremitting care of her conduct; nor was Glencairn le&s;s remarkable as a hu&s;band, than he had hitherto been from his &s;teady attachment as a lover, to the <HI>object of his fir&s;t choice.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. O'Trigger plunged into exce&s;s of wan|ton depravity; and a refu&s;al of Lady Jane's propo&s;al to receive and protect her at Allan|bank was the only in&s;tance of denial &s;he ex|perienced from her indulgent hu&s;band. His acquie&s;cence to pecuniary offers was not how|ever with-held from her, while any hope re|mained of her de&s;erving &s;uch an act of kindne&s;s; but her life was at length wholly ab&s;orbed by drunkenne&s;s and debauchery; and the pre|mature end of it was well calculated to afford a &s;triking example to A BAD HEART!</P>
<P>Nothing was wanting to augment the felici|ty of Glencairn, but an encrea&s;e of his family; and even that was almo&s;t compen&s;ated by the recollection that Mr. and Mrs. Courtenay were his heirs.</P>
<P>We will now take leave of Lady Jane Glen|cairn, and her happy hu&s;band. Con&s;tant pat|terns of connubial happine&s;s, their lives were &s;pent in the exerci&s;e of every &s;ocial virtue; and Lady Jane proved the happy <HI>Contra&s;t</HI> be|tween <HI>unavoidable error and premeditated <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ice.</HI></P>
