<P>BEING a&s;&s;embled here on &s;uch a &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, when we have before us a <HI>&s;orrowful Spectacle,</HI> one of our Fellow-Creatures under a Sentence of Death, for his Crimes committed, to be &s;peedily exe|cuted; it is very fit it &s;hould be accompanied with the <HI>Word of God and Prayer</HI>; that when &s;uch a numerous Audience of Chri&s;tians are together, not out of Curio&s;i|ty, we tru&s;t, but in a &s;erious Frame, with their Hearts affected, to con&s;ider the &s;orrowful Effects of Sin, and what <HI>Folly is in the Hearts of the Children of Men while they live,</HI> and how &s;oon for it, <HI>they go down to the dead</HI>; that they, as well as the Per&s;on him&s;elf, may receive &s;ome <HI>&s;ea&s;onable Divine In&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P>And having bin de&s;ir'd by the <HI>Reverend Pa&s;tor</HI> of the Church in this <HI>Town,</HI> to &s;tand in his Place on this Occa|&s;ion; I have turned my Tho'ts on this &s;erious Subject,&mdash; the <HI>Words</HI> which I have now read unto you; which &s;ugge&s;t unto us &s;ome of the mo&s;t affecting Motives <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> engage Per&s;ons again&s;t any manner of Irregularity, and that we &s;hould always <HI>&s;tand in awe, and not &s;in again&s;t God.</HI> This is the Improvement we &s;hould make of the <HI>In&s;tances</HI> of <HI>Judgment</HI> executed upon Men for their Ini|quities, and of the Admonitions and Warnings of the

<HI>Word,</HI> in both which <HI>the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, again&s;t the Ungodline&s;s and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of Men.</HI></P>
<P>In this Chapter, which is the <HI>Conclu&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Job</HI>'s Di&s;|cour&s;e with his <HI>Friends,</HI> he makes a very large and &s;o|lemn <HI>Defence</HI> of his Innocence and Integrity, and that he was clear of the Crimes that his Friends either charg'd upon him, or might &s;uppo&s;e him to be guilty of; which was not in way of O&s;tentation, but ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Vindication of him&s;elf. Happy the Man who&s;e Heart was thus upright towards God! This was his Con&s;olati|on in the <HI>day of evil.</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall not &s;tay to con&s;ider the Particulars in which this holy Man acquits him&s;elf.&mdash; The Words of the <HI>Text</HI> come in as the Rea&s;on why he avoided all <HI>har&s;h or &s;evere</HI> Dealing towards his <HI>Servants,</HI> which were very numerous. He con&s;idered God as <HI>his Judge,</HI> as well as <HI>his and their Creator,</HI> (v. 15.) and therefore he would not do any <HI>unequal or unrighteous</HI> thing to them.&mdash; Upon this Suppo&s;al, or if I &s;hould do &s;o&mdash;<HI>what then &s;hould I do when God ri&s;eth up?</HI>&mdash;&amp;c. God &s;o &s;uperiour to me and all Men, of infinite Power, and inflexible Ju&s;tice!</P>
<P>In this and divers other Pa&s;&s;ages in the Chapter, he &s;hews the Rea&s;on of his <HI>e&s;chewing Evil</HI>: It was becau&s;e he had a devout Regard to God, and
<Q>feared him, and that his Piety was at the Bottom of his Ju&s;tice and Charity, and this (as one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE> well ob&s;erves) crowns the Proof of his Sincerity.</Q></P>
<P>To give &s;ome Explication of the Words&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;<HI>When God ri&s;eth up</HI>&mdash;Such Po&s;tures of &s;itting and ri&s;ing&mdash;, are attributed to God, only figuratively, or after our manner of &s;peaking. God is &s;aid to <HI>&s;it on his Throne,</HI> in Allu&s;ion to earthly <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Judges,</HI> who &s;it and hear Cau&s;es, and give Sentence.

the <HI>actuating</HI> of his Power. Thus <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> prays, <HI>Numb.</HI> 10.35. <HI>Ri&s;e up, Lord, and let thine Enemies be &s;cattered.</HI> And thus his Church are taught to pray, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 68.1. When any expo&s;e them&s;elves to God's Di&s;plea&s;ure by Sin, they have Rea&s;on to put this trembling Que&s;tion to them&s;elves, <HI>What &s;hall I do, when God ri&s;eth up?</HI> The Expre&s;&s;ion imports, 1. <HI>Enquiry,</HI> as one asking Coun&s;el and Advice, not knowing what to do. Or, 2. It &s;igni|fies, or is the Language of Grief and Trouble, as one bemoaning his &s;ad Condition, perplexed with the Tho'ts of what he has done, or the Fears of what he &s;hall &s;uffer.</P>
<P><HI>And when he vi&s;iteth, what &s;hall I an&s;wer him?</HI></P>
<P>To vi&s;it is, in Scripture Sen&s;e, 1. &s;ometimes to <HI>&s;hew Favour</HI> and Kindne&s;s, as <HI>Luk.</HI> 1.68. <HI>God hath vi&s;ited</HI> and redeemed his People&mdash;, and v. 78. This was a mo&s;t gracious Vi&s;it indeed.</P>
<P>It is not meant in this Sen&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. To vi&s;it is to manife&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure, and to <HI>execute Judgment.</HI> Exod. 32.34. Neverthele&s;s, <HI>in the day when I vi&s;it, I will</HI> vi&s;it <HI>their Sin upon them.</HI> i. e. In way of Puni&s;hment; they &s;hall &s;uffer the &s;orrowful Effects of their Sin. And <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.9. and</P>
<P N="3">3. It &s;ignifies to <HI>call to an Account.</HI> This is the Office of a Superiour towards tho&s;e under his Charge and In|&s;pection. (<HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 4.9.)</P>
<P>In this and the &s;econd Sen&s;e this Expre&s;&s;ion may be under&s;tood. And the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> imports, that he &s;hould not be able to an&s;wer when God &s;hould call him to an Account, for any contemptuous Treatment or <HI>Unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI>: That he could not <HI>excu&s;e</HI> him&s;elf, nor expect to e&s;cape his righteous Judgment, nor could he deliver him|&s;elf out of his righteous Hand.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not con&s;ider the Words with the reference they have to tho&s;e ju&s;t preceeding, but as carrying in them a powerful <HI>Re&s;traint</HI> from <HI>all manner</HI> of Sin.</P>
<P><HI>Doctrine.</HI> They are very weighty Que&s;tions, which Per&s;ons &s;hould put clo&s;ely to them&s;elves, as a good Means to prevent their &s;inning, &mdash;<HI>What they &s;hall do
<PB N="8" REF="004326_0006_100411BB63704FB8">
when God ri&s;eth up? and when he vi&s;iteth, what they &s;hall an&s;wer him?</HI> Or,</P>
<P>That <HI>the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of God's vi&s;iting and judging Per&s;ons for their Sins, would be a happy Means to prevent their &s;inning again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P>In the 23d. v. of this Chapter, <HI>Job,</HI> to the like Pur|po&s;e, profe&s;&s;es, <HI>De&s;truction from God was a Terrour to me!</HI> Well may it be &s;o: It is &s;o to Nature, and it is &s;o to a gracious Soul.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>&s;ervile Fear</HI> in &s;ome, avoiding Evil, or <HI>Sin,</HI> only for fear of Evil or <HI>Puni&s;hment.</HI> But there is al&s;o a <HI>filial Fear,</HI> which &s;hould be laboured for and che|ri&s;hed. This &s;anctified Affection is attempered with Love to God, and does not afflict and di&s;quiet the Soul in its way, but keeps it from wandering out of the <HI>way of Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>It is becau&s;e Men don't <HI>con&s;ider,</HI> that they are not a|fraid of the Judgments of God. The want of Con&s;ide|ration is the great Mi&s;ery of Men! They <HI>con&s;ider not that they do evil.</HI> And they con&s;ider not what will <HI>be the Con&s;equences</HI> of their doing evil: And &s;o they dare to <HI>omit</HI> the Duties which God requires of them, and to <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;s</HI> his &s;acred Laws. Divine Coun&s;els and Per|&s;wa&s;ions prevail not, to any good Purpo&s;e, becau&s;e they do not &s;et them&s;elves to ponder and con&s;ider. This is God's complaint of his People, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.3. <HI>I&s;rael doth not know, my People doth not con&s;ider.</HI></P>
<P>There are very weighty Con&s;iderations which God &s;ets before Men to keep them in awe, that they might not dare to &s;in again&s;t him; &s;ufficient to over balance their corrupt Inclinations, and the &s;tronge&s;t Temptati|ons which they are expo&s;ed to; but this is their Un|happine&s;s, they will not <HI>apply</HI> their Hearts thereunto. It would &s;urely be of very powerful Tendency to pre|vent Men's &s;inning, if they would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, <HI>What they &s;hould do in the end thereof</HI>! as <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.31.</P>
<P>This may be evident, if we con&s;ider the <HI>following Heads.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="004326_0007_100453646B8D94F8" MS="y">1. That &s;uch Tho'ts will lead them into the Con&s;ide|ration that their <HI>Probation Time will come to an end.</HI> That there will certainly be an <HI>end of their Time,</HI> and Action, and manner of Life. God hath placed Men here on Earth in a &s;tate of <HI>Trial for Eternity.</HI> They have a great Bu&s;ine&s;s to do, and but a &s;hort Time to do it in. There is a Time and Sea&s;on for every lawful Bu&s;ine&s;s Men have to pro&s;ecute, but none for Sin. If Men would but con&s;ider, &s;urely they mu&s;t conclude, that God in <HI>who&s;e Hands their Breath is, and who&s;e are all their Ways,</HI> will bring their Opportunities to a Period; and that they know not how &s;oon: That he will not wait al|ways, and it may be not long. A few Weeks or Days, or for ought they know, an <HI>Hour</HI> may bring them to an End. If they pre&s;s'd home this Tho't; God &s;hall not always be as one &s;till and &s;ilent; he will put a Period to their Days, and then as there &s;hall be an End of all their worldly Enjoyments and Pur&s;uits, of all their &s;en|&s;ual Gratifications, of all their Sports and Plea&s;ures, &s;o al&s;o of all their <HI>Advantages</HI> of &s;eeking the Favour of God, and making Provi&s;ion for their Souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. As this leads them to con&s;ider that a righteous God will call them <HI>to an Account</HI> for all that they do. This is the Purport of the Words&mdash;, <HI>When God ri&s;eth up, and when he vi&s;iteth</HI>&mdash;. And this may refer to <HI>three</HI> di|&s;tinct <HI>Periods.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) God does often <HI>in this Life</HI> reckon with Men, or manife&s;t his Di&s;plea&s;ure for their Sins, in the <HI>Strokes of his Hand upon them.</HI> Thus the <HI>Lord is known by the Judgments which he executes. (P&s;al.</HI> 9.16.) He &s;aith concerning his People, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.9. <HI>Shall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e things</HI>&mdash;? And Ch. 14.10. <HI>I will remember their Iniquity, and vi&s;it their Sin&mdash;. Ho&s;.</HI> 9.9. Sometimes he vi&s;its them in Wrath, and puni&s;hes them in his &s;ore Di&s;plea&s;ure; &s;ometimes in Mercy, and to reduce them from the Error of their Ways, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89.32. He hath a great variety of Methods whereby he vi&s;its and cha&s;ti|zes them for their Sins in this Life, as he threatned
<PB N="10" REF="004326_0008_100453694A720AB0">
them <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.14&mdash;39. He brings Wars, Scarcity, Fa|mine, and &s;ometimes &s;ore &amp; mortal Sickne&s;s, <HI>&s;ore Sickne&s;s, and of long continuance,</HI> and all to vindicate his own Name and Honour, becau&s;e Men would not con&s;ider their Ways, and turn from their Sins.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) God vi&s;its all Men at the <HI>Day of Death.</HI> And this &s;ometimes by the Hand of <HI>Humane Ju&s;tice,</HI> or by his own immediate Hand&mdash;. It may be &s;uitable on this Occa&s;ion, to mention <HI>&s;uch Crimes</HI> as the Laws of this Land have made <HI>Capital,</HI> or to be puni&s;hed with <HI>Death.</HI> Po&s;&s;ibly it may prevent &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;inning in Igno|rance of their Danger.&mdash; As, the <HI>murdering</HI> of any Per|&s;on, which is to be puni&s;hed with <HI>Death,</HI> by the Laws of God, and the Laws of all civilized Nations. And a Woman being delivered when <HI>alone</HI> of a <HI>&s;purious Child,</HI> tho' the Child may happen to be <HI>&s;till born,</HI> or <HI>die,</HI> yet &s;he is liable to &s;uffer as a <HI>Murderer,</HI> not calling for Help. So the <HI>burning</HI> of a dwelling <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> or other Hou&s;e or Parcel thereof, or any Hou&s;e built for <HI>publick U&s;e,</HI> any Barn having Corn, Grain or Hay therein, any Mill, Malt-Hou&s;e, Store-Hou&s;e, Shop or Shops, when done wilfully by any Per&s;on above the Age of Sixteen Years, the &s;ame is adjudg'd a <HI>Felon,</HI> and to &s;uffer the <HI>Pains of Death.</HI> And &s;o the abominable Sin of <HI>Buggery,</HI> with Mankind or Bea&s;t, and the Sin of <HI>Rape or Ravi&s;hment</HI>; as al&s;o <HI>Polygamy,</HI> or having more than one Wife at the &s;ame Time&mdash;. For <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> of any kind, and particularly <HI>counterfeiting the King's Great or Privy Seal</HI>: For <HI>counter|feiting the Seal of the Province</HI>: For counterfeiting the <HI>Bills of publick Credit.&mdash;A&s;&s;ault and Robbery</HI> upon a <HI>&s;econd Conviction.</HI> And for <HI>Burglary,</HI> or a Per&s;on's break|ing and entring a Dwelling Hou&s;e in the Night, with a felonious Intent to rob or &s;teal, or do any other Felony, being convicted thereof, &s;hall <HI>&s;uffer the Pains of Death.</HI> For which Crime the <HI>poor Pri&s;oner</HI> here, has been ad|judg'd to &s;uffer Death.</P>
<P>But if it be by the Hand of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> or the <HI>Providence</HI> of God, or in what Manner &s;oever, it is an awful <HI>Vi&s;it</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="004326_0009_10045413E33F8B58">
to every unrighteous Man, every impenitent Sinner; for then the <HI>Reward of his Hand &s;hall be given him.</HI> I&s;a. 3.11. We are a&s;&s;ured concerning Men in common, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27.) <HI>It is appointed unto Men once to die, and after that the Judgment.</HI> Tho' we know not what man|ner of <HI>Proce&s;s</HI> there &s;hall be at Death, yet this we are &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ur'd of from many Pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Scripture,</HI> that every particular Per&s;on's Judgment is pa&s;s'd <HI>at Death,</HI> and their State irrever&s;ibly determined by the glorious Judge. The <HI>Spirits of the ju&s;t</HI> are <HI>made perfect,</HI> and the Souls of the wicked are pre&s;ently &s;ent into the Place of Torments. <HI>Prov.</HI> 14.32.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The great Judge will come to <HI>vi&s;it</HI> and call all Men to an Account <HI>at the Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</HI> This we are plainly a&s;&s;ured of in the <HI>&s;acred Oracles,</HI> that God &s;hall judge both the Righteous and the wicked. God <HI>hath appointed a Day in which he will judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Act. 17.31. No Man &s;hall e&s;cape this Judgment of God. <HI>We mu&s;t all appear before the Judg|ment-Seat of Chri&s;t.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.10. Then the <HI>Books &s;hall be opened,</HI> and all that have liv'd and died from <HI>Adam</HI> to the end of Time, &s;hall be judged out of them. <HI>Rev.</HI> 20.12. This was what the World was warned of &s;o long ago as the Days of <HI>Enoch,</HI> Jude, v. 14,15. Thus there will be a &s;trict Account taken what <HI>Rules</HI> they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, what Bonds and Obligations they have vi|olated, what <HI>Evils</HI> they have done, and what <HI>Duties</HI> they have left undone. Then Sinners mu&s;t <HI>&s;tand forth</HI> before the va&s;t Multitude, however reluctant, mi&s;erable and a&s;hamed they may be! Then they &s;hall be call'd to an Account how they have improv'd the <HI>outward En|joyments</HI> God gave them; whether they honoured the Lord with their Sub&s;tance, and were <HI>ju&s;t and hone&s;t</HI> in all their Dealings and Concerns with Men. Whether they were <HI>merciful, kind and charitable</HI>; &mdash; and how they govern'd their <HI>bodily Appetites</HI> and Inclinations; whether they were <HI>&s;ober, cha&s;t and temperate</HI>; and whether they were good and faithful and obliging in the &s;everal <HI>Relati|ons</HI>

In Sum, we are taught <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12.14. <HI>God &s;hall bring into Judgment every Work, with every &s;ecret Thing, whether it be good or evil.</HI> Then the Lord who is <HI>a God of Knowledge,</HI> and by whom <HI>Actions are weighed,</HI> (1 Sam. 2.3.) and who knows <HI>all Hearts,</HI> will not only di&s;cover "who and what was good, and what "was bad, but <HI>how good</HI> and <HI>how bad,</HI> every thing was, that was done by Men.</P>
<P>And in this <HI>great Audit,</HI> this <HI>Vi&s;itation Day,</HI> who will be able to an&s;wer! We are a&s;&s;ured that the <HI>ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in the Judgment.</HI> The Lord <HI>acknowledgeth the way of the Righteous</HI>; only tho&s;e &s;hall be in Safety, who have a Principle of Holine&s;s wrought in them, and the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to them.</P>
<P>Would not &s;uch Tho'ts clo&s;ely pre&s;s'd upon the Mind, greatly re&s;train Per&s;ons from all Ways of Sin, and pro|mote their Repentance for Sin?</P>
<P N="3">3. By &s;uch Tho'ts they would be led to di&s;cern the <HI>Vanity</HI> and In&s;ufficiency of tho&s;e <HI>Pleas and Excu&s;es,</HI> whereby they endeavour to quiet them&s;elves in their &s;in|ful Neglects and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. Sometimes Per&s;ons excu&s;e them&s;elves that they were drawn and enticed into Sin by <HI>in&s;naring Companions</HI>: And it is too true, that this has bin the Bane of many a one!

Do the&s;e and &s;uch Con&s;iderations melt your Heart, and make you &s;en&s;ible that it is an <HI>Evil Thing and bitter,</HI> that you have <HI>for&s;aken the Lord,</HI> and that his <HI>Fear hath not been in your Heart</HI>?</P>
<P>Have you been fir&s;t, brought to &s;ee <HI>your &s;elf,</HI> in a Spiritual Sen&s;e, a poor helple&s;s, wretched, <HI>undone Creature</HI>; and that you can make no amends, no Satisfaction to Divine Ju&s;tice for your Offences, by your Prayers or Tears or Promi&s;es? But yet that you are a <HI>Pri&s;oner of Hope:</HI> You have read and heard, <HI>This is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all Acceptation, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the World to &s;ave Sinners,</HI> even <HI>the Chief.</HI> Hath this been joyful Tidings to you?</P>
<P>Do you indeed believe <HI>that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, the Son of the Living God?</HI> and that as a glorious <HI>High Prie&s;t,</HI> he appears in the Heavens for us? And is <HI>able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come unto God by him</HI>? Then let not the <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> of your Sins di&s;courage your <HI>betaking your &s;elf to him,</HI> nor prevent your pleading and tru&s;ting in the infinite Merits of the <HI>all &s;ufficient Saviour.</HI> God can pardon great Sins, and &s;ave the chief of Sin|ners, con&s;i&s;tent with the Honour of his <HI>Ju&s;tice, Holine&s;s and Truth.</HI> When the Apo&s;tle mentions the <HI>black Catalogue</HI> of Sinners, among which are the <HI>unrighteous</HI> and <HI>Thieves,</HI> (1 Cor. 6.9.10.) he &s;aith, <HI>Such were &s;ome of you, but ye are ju&s;tified,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, this is the <HI>Work mo&s;t plea&s;ing to God,</HI> that you can perform&punc; to <HI>believe in the Name of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and put your tru&s;t in his perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that you <HI>commit your Soul</HI> into his Hands, that he would &s;ave it from <HI>Sin</HI> and from the Hands of your Spiritual <HI>Enemies,</HI> and from Eternal <HI>Death.</HI> You are ju&s;t going to appear before <HI>the Judge of all the Earth</HI>! Does this fill you with dread, under a Sen&s;e of your Guilt, and that you have nothing to an&s;wer? Let this Tho't be your &s;upport, That CHRIST graciou&s;ly offers to be your Saviour, and a&s;&s;ures you, <HI>that who&s;oever cometh unto him, he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t him out.</HI> If you can now under&s;tandly come unto him <HI>weary and heavy laden with your Sins,</HI> de&s;irous to be &s;aved from all Sin, and to be made <HI>holy</HI> and fit for the Heavenly

Inheritance, then your E&s;tate will be &s;afe. This mi&s;erable Death will not &s;eparate you from his Favour. <HI>Unbelief</HI> will <HI>damn you,</HI> but if you believe in Chri&s;t, your other Sins will not.</P>
<P>O may the wonderful <HI>Love of Chri&s;t,</HI> who was <HI>hanged on a Tree,</HI> to &s;ave us from Eternal Death, affect and draw your Heart unto him.</P>
<P>Now call to Mind that memorable In&s;tance of one of the <HI>Thieves</HI> who were <HI>crucified</HI> with Chri&s;t, who, confe&s;&s;ing that they ju&s;tly &s;uffered, as <HI>receiving the due Reward of their Deeds,</HI> &s;aith unto Chri&s;t, <HI>Lord, remember me, when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom.</HI> (Luk. 23.41, 42.) So under a Sen&s;e of your own rightful Suffering, humbly look unto Je&s;us, with this dy<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> Wi&s;h, and fervent Prayer, <HI>Lord remember me now</HI> thou art <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">alted in thy <HI>Heavenly Kingdom.</HI>&mdash; Lord Je&s;us <HI>receive my Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>Give Honour to God,</HI> as far as you can, by bear|ing Te&s;timony to his righteous Laws,&mdash;by <HI>publick Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of your Sins, taking Shame to your&s;elf. Ju&s;tifying a righteous <HI>Providence,</HI> and your <HI>Judges,</HI> and be in <HI>Charity</HI> with all Men.</P>
<P>And give <HI>Warning</HI> unto others, that they may not &s;in again&s;t God as you have done, nor run into any evil and wicked Ways <HI>which lead to De&s;truction and Perdition!</HI> And particularly the <HI>Young People,</HI> that they do not hearken to the Temptations of Satan and evil Men; but <HI>fear God in their Youth,</HI> and beware of all <HI>beginnings of Departing from</HI> God.&mdash; I am glad you have been di&s;po&s;ed to make Confe&s;&s;ion of your Sins and give Warn|ing to Sinners, may they <HI>hear and fear and turn from their Wick|edne&s;s</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P>If you are enabled by Divine Grace to comply with the Coun&s;els given you, and are heartily de&s;irous thus to <HI>give Glory to God,</HI> you &s;hall be among tho&s;e in whom free Grace <HI>&s;hall be for ever admired,</HI> and exalted! Which may God grant, for his Mercies Sake in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. To whom be Glory for ever. AMEN.</P>
