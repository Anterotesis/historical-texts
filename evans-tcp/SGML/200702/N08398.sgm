<P>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Per&s;ons whom this doth, &s;hall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-&s;econd Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and Sixty-&s;even, PERSONALLY came and appeared <HI>Gabriel Manigault, John Neu&s;ville, John Chapman, John Gordon, Thomas Shirley,</HI> and <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> Merchants, dwelling in Charles-Town, in the Province afore&s;aid, who being &s;everally and duly &s;worn upon the Holy Evangeli&s;ts of Almighty God, made Oath and declared, That on or about the Twenty-&s;ixth Day of May la&s;t pa&s;t, there having been divers Complaints among the Merchants in the &s;aid Place, of enhanced Fees and Exactions at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, &s;ince the Arrival of <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Collector of the Cu&s;toms; &s;everal of which Com|plaints were founded upon Circum&s;tances and Facts, within their own Knowledge; and al&s;o having heard that the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had contrary to the Practice of his Predece&s;&s;or in Office, the late <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> demanded and received Fees for granting or &s;igning Indico Certificates; and further, that he had particularly required and in&s;i&s;ted upon every decked Boat and Schooner going to any of the neighbouring Rivers and Plantations within this Province, whether loaden or light, to take out Regi&s;ters, and al&s;o Permits from him the &s;aid Collector, as well as to enter into Bond; for which Bond and Permit, a certain Sum of Money was to be paid to the &s;aid Collector, and One-third Part of the &s;aid Sum to the Comptroller of the Cu&s;toms: They the &s;aid <HI>Gabriel Manigault, John Neu&s;ville, John Chapman, John Gordon, Thomas Shirley,</HI> and <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> did then, and at the particular De&s;ire of a great Majority of the Merchants and Traders in Charles-Town, (and under&s;tanding at the &s;ame Time, that it would al&s;o be particularly agreeable to the Collector to have an Interview and Ecclairci&s;&s;ement with the Merchants) wait upon him the &s;aid Collector at his own Hou&s;e, as a Committee from the Body of Merchants, to Addre&s;s and Remon&s;trate to him, upon the gene|ral Complaints abovementioned. At their fir&s;t Vi&s;it, the Collector not being pre|pared to receive them, they the &s;aid Committee retired, and waited upon him again, by his own Appointment, the Day following; and then <HI>Gabriel Manigault,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;peaking on Behalf of the Re&s;t, informed the Collector of the general Com|plaint of Merchants and Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els, that the Fees taken at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e were of late greatly increa&s;ed, and that it had been al&s;o alledged, that Fees for &s;igning Indico Certificates, contrary to Law and Cu&s;tom, had of late been demanded, and taken by him the &s;aid Collector: That the Merchants were very &s;orry that there was any ground for Complaint, and that it was their earne&s;t Wi&s;h and De&s;ire, to maintain a right Under&s;tanding, and to live in Harmony with him the &s;aid Collector, as they had heretofore had the Happine&s;s of in the Time of the late Collector, Mr. <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain:</HI> To the fir&s;t Complaint, the Collector replied, that he could not Account for the Advance of Fees in any other Way than the Multiplicity of Bonds and Certificates required by late Acts of Parliament: To the &s;econd Complaint, his An&s;wer was by no means Satisfactory, INASMUCH as his Apology was only this, That upon a Demand made of Mr. <HI>James Poyas,</HI> by the Collector's Clerk, for a Fee upon an Indico Certificate, which the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Poyas</HI> had paid, but murmured at it, as being an Exaction, the Collector had called to him as he was going out of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and &s;aid, "don't pay it Mr. <HI>Poyas,</HI> don't pay it;" whereas it was remarked to the Collector, that if in&s;tead of calling to Mr. <HI>Poyas</HI> not to pay the Fee, he had forbid his Clerk to receive it, and Chid him for his Pre&s;umption, that would have been more effectual. FURTHER the &s;aid Committee &s;ay, That in order to be explicit with the Collector, in one other In&s;tance of what they apprehended to be an Exaction of Fees, and which was mentioned by Mr. <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> in the Ca&s;e of the Ship <HI>Anne, George

<P>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Per&s;ons whom this doth, &s;hall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-eighth Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and Sixty-&s;even, PERSONALLY came and appeared <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the Committee of the Merchants, and others, Traders in Charles-Town, and who hath been a Briti&s;h Merchant TWENTY-THREE YEARS; who being duly &s;worn upon the Holy Evangeli&s;ts of Almighty God, maketh Oath and declares, That the Collector <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> often endeavoured to per&s;uade him the Deponent, that there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for every Coa&s;ting Schooner or Schooners that pa&s;&s;ed Fort <HI>John&s;on,</HI> to enter into Bond to him the Collector, and take out a Permit for Six Months; that there was no Medium between regularly entering and clearing &s;uch Schooners, although in Balla&s;t, and only going to &s;ome of the neighbouring Plantations every Voyage, and taking &s;uch Certificates as he propo&s;ed; that if they did not comply with one or other, Seizure and Forfeiture mu&s;t inevitably follow; and therefore he de&s;ired the &s;aid <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> to u&s;e his Influence with other the principal Merchants, that they might comply with his, the Collector's Propo&s;ition; adding, that &s;everal low Per&s;ons had offered to take &s;uch Permits, but that he cho&s;e to begin at the other End, or with other Sort of People; to which the &s;aid <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> replied in general, that he by no means thought it improper that &s;ome Part of the Coa&s;ting Trade &s;hould be under due Regulation; but that in the exten&s;ive Manner that the Collector required, it would
<PB N="5" REF="010748_0003_0F81745EB8891D30">
Di&s;tre&s;s the Province in general; that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to comply with it, and that it would an&s;wer no good End to the Public; and be&s;ides, that if the Collector's Permits were to guard them effectually again&s;t Seizures from the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers on board of his Maje&s;ty's Ships, he the Deponent was of Opinion that &s;uch Permits might have a dangerous Tendency, and be made a Cloak for illicit and irregular Trade; but that neverthele&s;s, if there was any Act of Parlia|ment obliging &s;uch &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els to take Certificates, he &s;hould for his own Part, pay due Obedience to it as far as po&s;&s;ible, and &s;hould al&s;o recommend the &s;ame to his Friends. The Collector a&s;&s;ured the Deponent, that it was in his Power to compel all &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els to enter and clear every Trip they made to and from the Plantations: To which the Deponent replied, that he believed the Collector might by an Exten&s;ion of his Power, create a great deal of Trouble to the People in Carolina, but that he was likewi&s;e certain, the Collector might al&s;o avoid giving them &s;uch Trouble, and yet not relax from his Duty; and that in his Opinion a mere Exertion of Power would finally be attended with no real Service to the King, nor was it to be &s;et in Competition with the Affections of a whole Province, or Words to that Effect: And about the &s;ame Time the Deponent a&s;ked the Collector to favour him with a Sight of any Act of Parliament from whence he derived &s;uch Power and Authority, and al&s;o to inform him what Price or Fee he would demand for &s;uch Half yearly Certificates: The Deponent has forgot what An&s;wer the Collector gave to the fir&s;t Que&s;tion, but he knows that the Collector never &s;hewed him his Authority by Law, in Support of his Demand: But to the &s;econd, the Collector a&s;ked him what he thought of <HI>Half a Guinea</HI> for the Bond and Certificate; this Deponent an&s;wered, that if the Ca&s;e was really as the Collector had repre&s;ented to him, he thought the Collector's Demand was rather Indulgent. This Deponent further declares, that on the &s;ame Day, he heard the Honourable <HI>John Drayton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and his Son <HI>William Henry Drayton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;everally a&s;k the Collector what was to be the Fee for &s;uch Bond and Certificate; and that the Collector replied to one <HI>Three Pounds Fifteen Shillings</HI> Current Money, and to the other <HI>Seven Pounds</HI> Current Money: That about the &s;ame Time he was informed by <HI>John Wragg,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> that the Collector had demanded of him an <HI>Engli&s;h Guinea</HI> for &s;uch Bond and Certificate; and he was al&s;o further informed, and hath &s;ince found it to be true, that the Collector had granted &s;everal of his Certificates at various Prices, &s;ome at <HI>Thirty Shillings,</HI> &s;ome at <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> Currency, and &s;o forth: That upon hearing the Collector him&s;elf vary &s;o much in his Demand, and al&s;o his declining or omitting to &s;hew this Deponent his Authority, derived from any Statute or Act of Parliament, as well as doubting the Legality of his Permits to pa&s;s Fort <HI>John&s;on,</HI> he thought and &s;aid, that the Collector did not Tread upon firm Ground, and therefore doubted whether he had any Authority for the Demands which he had made: And the &s;aid <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> al&s;o declareth, that about that Time, while he was further conver&s;ing with the Collector on the Subject above|mentioned in the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, the Collector informed him that Captain <HI>Hawker,</HI> of his Maje&s;ty's Sloop <HI>Sardcine,</HI> had &s;iezed one of the Coa&s;ting Schooners belonging to this Province; adding, that if he was to join Captain <HI>Hawker,</HI> in an Information or Pro&s;ecution again&s;t the &s;aid Schooner, &s;he would certainly be condemned as forfeited; to which this Deponent replied, that he hoped then that HE the Collector would not join Captain <HI>Hawker,</HI> becau&s;e if there was any Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t have been the Effect of Inadvertence and Ignorance, &s;ince it was evident no Fraud was de&s;igned, as the Ve&s;&s;el had actually come into this Port or Harbour, under the immediate View of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers; the Collector an&s;wered no, by no Means would he join Captain <HI>Hawker</HI>; but at the &s;ame Time advi&s;ed the Deponent very earne&s;tly, to &s;peak to other Merchants, and to comply with his forementioned Propo&s;ition and Demand, which he added would be their only, or be&s;t Way, and then &s;aid he, your Ve&s;&s;els may &s;ail in Safety.</P>
<P>THIS Deponent further declareth, That in Con&s;equence of the Invitation or Permi&s;&s;ion given by the Collector, he directed <HI>George Forten,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> together with <HI>John Hopton,</HI> Clerk to this Deponent, to wait upon the Col|lector at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, with all his Papers received at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, at the clearing out the &s;aid Ship, in order to obtain a particular Account of the &s;everal Items, making up the &s;aid Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds.</HI> And that the &s;aid <HI>George
<PB N="6" REF="010748_0004_0F8174605CC60338">
Forten,</HI> and <HI>John Hopton,</HI> did accordingly attend the Collector at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e; from whence being returned, they informed this Deponent that the Collector had received them very angrily, and &s;aid, that as the Merchants were &s;o exact with him, he would be &s;o to them, and that not one Indulgence &s;hould be granted to them after that Time; and that he the Collector then produced an Account of his Fees for the &s;aid Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> which amounted to <HI>Fourteen Pounds Two Shillings and Six-pence</HI>; that he demanded immediate Payment of the additional <HI>Two Shillings and Six-pence,</HI> Carolina Currency, and declared that not one of the Ship's Papers &s;hould go out of the Office until the &s;ame was paid: That they attempted to expo&s;tulate upon this new Account, in order to &s;hew certain Over-charges therein; but that the Collector would not hear them, but very wrathfully di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, &s;aying he would not lo&s;e his Time in Di&s;putes: Which &s;everal Particulars will appear more at large in a Prote&s;t made by the &s;aid <HI>George Forten, John Hopton,</HI> and <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> on the fir&s;t of June, 1767, and is hereunto annexed. [<HI>Vide No.</HI> 1] And the &s;aid <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> further &s;aith, That notwith&s;tanding the Behaviour of the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> as la&s;t abovementioned, &s;o contrary to his Promi&s;es made to the Committee of Merchants, as well as to him&s;elf in particular; and notwith&s;tanding his own Conviction, that the Collector had exacted Fees more than was due to him in that Ca&s;e abovementioned, by in&s;erting &s;ome Charges that were Fictions, as well as by a Duplicity of others; yet willing as much as in him lay, to pre&s;erve Harmony, and keep up a good Under&s;tanding with the Collector, and al&s;o to &s;hew all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect to one of his Maje&s;ty's Officers, in &s;o high a Rank as the Collector of the Cu&s;toms, he went on the Day following, (to wit, the 29th of May) to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and there addre&s;&s;ed the Collector in re&s;pectful Terms, and de&s;ired to Remon&s;trate upon the Subject of the Charges abovementioned; that the Collector went towards his De&s;k as if he meant to examine into the &s;aid Complaint, but &s;uddenly turned about, and in &s;ome Warmth, &s;aid it was an Holyday, that he was bu&s;y, and &s;hould be more &s;o pre&s;ently: Whereupon the Deponent an&s;wered, that he &s;aw the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e open, and therefore came in, not merely to a&s;k a Favour, but to apply for Redre&s;s in a Matter wherein he thought him&s;elf aggrieved, and that he now reque&s;ted the Collector to inform him whether he would grant him &s;uch Redre&s;s or not: The Collector then de&s;ired him to defer the Bu&s;ine&s;s until the Saturday Afternoon following, and then if the Deponent would attend him at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, he would Retro&s;pect the Account aforementioned: And the &s;aid <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> further &s;aith, That having other Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to tran&s;act at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, he went there on Saturday Morning, and that the Collector then told him he need not be at the Trouble of coming in the Afternoon according to Appointment, for he determined to return no Part of the Fees taken for clearing out the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> and that he took that as an Opportunity to inform the Deponent; whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> thinking him&s;elf greatly injured, and oppre&s;&s;ed by the &s;aid Collector, cau&s;ed the Prote&s;t before referred to, to be extended on Behalf of him&s;elf and others, Owners of the &s;aid Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> (to wit, on the fir&s;t of June, 1767).

The Clerk informed him <HI>Ten Shillings</HI> each Certificate, which the Deponent was proceeding to pay, but the Clerk added, that he mu&s;t al&s;o pay for &s;earching the Cockets; to which the Deponent replied, that he imagined he the Clerk had no right to make him pay for that; whereupon the Collector, <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> without &s;aying one Word, came in a Pa&s;&s;ion from a di&s;tant Part of the Room, took up the five Certificates, tore them in Pieces, and told the Deponent that he &s;hould go and procure a Certificate from the Searchers before he would grant him any Certificates, and that he might &s;eek his Remedy where he plea&s;ed. The &s;aid <HI>John Edwards</HI> further &s;aith, That on the Twelfth Day of June la&s;t pa&s;t, he went to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e to clear the Ship <HI>Fair American, John Min&s;hall,</HI> Ma&s;ter, for <HI>Liverpool</HI>; that the Collector ob&s;erving one Pipe of Wine in&s;erted in the Manife&s;t; he a&s;ked if the King's Duty was paid for it, and was an&s;wered that it was imported by Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Brailsford</HI> and <HI>Chapman,</HI> of Charles-Town, Merchants, and the Duty &s;ecured; which was confirmed by Mr. <HI>Hatley,</HI> the Collector's Clerk, who a&s;&s;ured him, more than once, that the Duty was &s;ecured; neverthele&s;s, the Collector (merely as the Deponent believes, to impede his Bu&s;ine&s;s and to put him to Trouble) refu&s;ed to clear the Ship before Me&s;&s;rs. <HI>Brailsford</HI> and <HI>Chapman</HI> were &s;ent for to pay the &s;aid Duty.

The Deponent then endeavoured to exculpate him&s;elf, by repeating the Collector's own Words, &s;poke in Pre&s;ence of &s;o many People as were then in the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e; but the Collector interrupted, and threatened to turn him down Stairs out of the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e; which the Deponent conceiving to be grievous and injurious Treatment to one of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects, who had always demeaned him&s;elf becomingly to all his Maje&s;ty's Officers; and al&s;o a great Impediment and Hinderance to Commerce, as well as a Di&s;couragement to his Maje&s;ty's dutiful Subjects, Briti&s;h Merchants re&s;iding in America, did pre&s;ume to Reply, That while he had Bu&s;ine&s;s to do in Office Hours, he had a good Right to be in the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and that if the Collector turned him out, it mu&s;t be at his own Peril.

And it appears to us, that &s;uch further or additional Fees or Charges as can or may be legally demanded and taken by the Collector, for

And the&s;e Deponents do further declare, That it was always their earne&s;t De&s;ire and Wi&s;h, and they have the greate&s;t Rea&s;on to believe ALSO, that it was the earne&s;t Wi&s;h and De&s;ire of the Merchants in Charles-Town, to have liquidated and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed with the pre&s;ent Collector, <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> &s;ome &s;uch, or other rea&s;onable and equitable, legal or cu&s;tomary Fees, for the Government both of the Collector and the Merchants. And in their Opinion, nothing on their Part hath been wanting to bring the &s;ame to Effect, as they are fully convinced, that they are &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed and willing to pay all lawful Duties and Cu&s;toms; but too tender of their Rights and Liberties as Briti&s;h Subjects, to &s;ubimt tamely to repeated illegal Impo&s;itions.</P>

To which the &s;aid Collector in reply, a&s;ked, "if he had not a Bill of the Fees as u&s;ual from each Officer?" and the &s;aid <HI>George Forten</HI> an&s;wered, you mi&s;under|&s;tand me, Sir,&mdash;I de&s;ire a particular Account of your own Charges making up <HI>Fourteen Pounds,</HI> 'tis a con&s;iderable deal more than I ever paid before in this Port to the Collector, for which Rea&s;on my Owners at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> will require me to explain that Article.&mdash;That the Collector with &s;ome warmth an&s;wered, I have no Objection to giving what you demand; but &s;ince the Merchants require &s;o much Exactne&s;s in me, I &s;hall u&s;e the &s;ame Method towards them, and whatever comes within the Verge of Acts of Parliament, &s;hall be &s;trictly complied with, and not one Indul|gence &s;hall be granted to them hereafter; perhaps your Fees may exceed my Charge, which I find they do by <HI>Two Shillings and Six-pence</HI>; and then producing an Account of Particulars, amounting to <HI>Fourteen Pounds Two Shillings and Six-pence,</HI> demanded Payment of the Deficiency of <HI>Two Shillings and Six-pence</HI> Currency, (equal to <HI>Four-pence</HI> Sterling) otherwi&s;e he the Collector declared not one of his Papers &s;hould go out of the Office.</P>
<P>JOHN HOPTON, depo&s;eth and &s;aith, That upon the Collector's &s;peaking as la&s;t above-mentioned, he took up the &s;aid Account, of which the following is an exact Copy, and the Original hereunto annexed compared therewith, by me, the the &s;aid Notary, <HI>VIZ.</HI>

And &s;aid to the Collector, Sir, you have charged here to make up your Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> paid on Saturday, <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> for a Po&s;t-Entry, which was not made, nor even thought of before Monday; therefore there &s;till appears an over Charge of <HI>Seventeen Shillings and Six-pence</HI> for clearing out: The Collector angrily an&s;wered, that he knew, or could fore&s;ee on Saturday, that &s;uch an Entry mu&s;t be made, therefore the whole was &s;till right: That he <HI>John Hopton</HI> then ob&s;erved to the Collector, that there was a Charge for Cockets, whereas none &s;uch were had or applied for, and therefore there was no Room for that Article to be charged: That the Collector then a&s;ked where is the Ve&s;&s;el bound to, is &s;he not bound for <HI>Li&s;bon</HI>? he the &s;aid Deponent an&s;wered no, &s;he is bound to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and therefore had no Cockets.&mdash;That the Collector then with great warmth, &s;aid it was no Matter, or he did not care for that, and added, "I again repeat, that I am entitled to the whole Sum which is &s;et down, and if you cannot &s;ee the Propriety of my Charge, I cannot help you:" And the &s;aid <HI>John Hopton</HI> further &s;aith, That the Collector's An&s;wer being un&s;atisfactory, both to Captain <HI>Forten</HI> and him&s;elf, and being prompted thereto by a Sen&s;e of his Duty, he took the Liberty, but with all Deference to the Collector, to proceed and &s;ay unto him, I &s;hall be glad, Sir, to have other Articles in the Account made plainer, &s;ome of which I think were ne|ver had, nor even applied for: In An&s;wer to which, the Collector continuing angry, &s;aid, "I have done, and will do no more in the Affair; I have no Time to lo&s;e, and will not have my Time taken up in Di&s;putes of this Nature." Whereupon <PB N="29" REF="010748_0015_0F8174718319C320">
the &s;aid <HI>John Hopton,</HI> (having fir&s;t paid the aforementioned odd <HI>Two shillings and Six-pence</HI> Currency, for which the Ship's Papers were detained) together with Captain <HI>Forten,</HI> retired from the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>HENRY LAURENS, doth further declare, That after having heard the Re|ception which Captain <HI>Forten</HI> had met with from the Collector, &s;o contrary to his the Collector's Promi&s;es, when he de&s;ired that Captain <HI>Forten</HI> &s;hould wait upon him with his Papers; he the &s;aid <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> went on the Twenty-ninth of May afore&s;aid to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, and then and there, in Pre&s;ence of <HI>I&s;aac Mazyck,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Mr. <HI>William Banbury,</HI> de&s;ired to Remon&s;trate to the &s;aid Collector upon the Subject above-mentioned; a&s;&s;uring the &s;aid Collector, that there were in his &s;aid Account certain Articles, which ought not to be charged therein; that the Collector &s;eemed to be proceeding to examine into the &s;aid Complaint, but, on a &s;udden, &s;aid in &s;ome warmth, that it was a Holyday, that he was bu&s;y, and &s;hould be more &s;o pre&s;ently: Whereupon the &s;aid Deponent replied, that he thought him&s;elf aggrieved; that he did not come to a&s;k any Favours, but applied for Redre&s;s, which he conceived he had a Right to apply for at the Collector's own Hou&s;e, or even in the Street, Holyday or no Holyday, and reque&s;ted the Collector to inform him whether he would grant him &s;uch Redre&s;s or not: In An&s;wer, the Collector de&s;ired him to defer the Bu&s;ine&s;s until next Day, and appointed Three o'Clock Saturday Afternoon for the Deponent <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> to attend him at the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e; at which Time and Place he promi&s;ed to retro&s;pect his &s;aid Account, in order, as the Deponent under&s;tood, to allow and return for any illegal Charges. And this Deponent, <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> further &s;aith, That having other Bu&s;ine&s;s at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, he went there on the Morning of the &s;aid Saturday, about Eleven o'Clock, when the Collector informed him, that he had fully con&s;i|dered the Affair of his Fees on the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> and was determined not to return any Part of the Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds,</HI> taken for clearing her out; and that therefore the Deponent need not be at the Trouble of coming at Three o'Clock, according to the former Appointment: Further the Deponent &s;aith, That the Po&s;t-Entry before-mentioned was not fore&s;een, nor even expected by him when the Ship <HI>Anne</HI> was cleared out; that the Alteration in the Ship's Clearance, (called and charged upon this Occa&s;ion a Po&s;t-Entry) was on Account of twelve Barrels of Rice, taken from on board the Ship, in order to accommodate certain Pa&s;&s;engers.</P>

<P>THE Attorney-General having &s;ug|ge&s;ted to the Court, that he had re|ceived from the Crown-Office, an Affidavit made by <HI>John Logan,</HI> of Charles-Town, Merchant, charging the Honourable <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with Extortion in his Office of Collector of his Maje&s;ty's Cu&s;toms for the Port of Charles-Town; and al&s;o a Recognizance which the &s;aid <HI>John Logan</HI> had entered into, to pro&s;ecute and give Evidence again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> at this pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ions; that he had learned that the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> had quitted this Province, having evaded entering into Security to an&s;wer the &s;aid Pro&s;ecution, and was therefore now not amenable to the Ju&s;tice of this Court: And the Attorney-General having further &s;ugge&s;ted that the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Moore</HI> had behaved towards him in &s;uch a Manner as made him, from a Point of Delicacy, decline giving out a Bill of Indictment to the Grand Jury again&s;t him the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> without the Directions of the Court, which he there|fore prayed. The Court having taken the Premi&s;es into Con&s;ideration, and it ap|pearing that the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Moore</HI> bad been repeatedly guilty of a Breach of Pro|mi&s;e to Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Pringle,</HI> who being applied to, to bind him over to an&s;wer the &s;aid Pro&s;ecution, had behaved to him with great Lenity and Politene&s;s, and tru&s;t|ing to his Promi&s;es, had delayed binding him over; the Court therefore con&s;idering that the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Moore</HI> had taken a very ungenteel Advantage of the Lenity which had been &s;hewn him, by withdrawing him&s;elf from Ju&s;tice, directed the Attorney-General to give out a Bill of Indictment to the Grand Jury again&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> upon the Evidence of the &s;aid <HI>John Logan,</HI> which was done accordingly.</P>

<P>AND having heard all Parties, by their Proctors and Advocates, relative to the Legality of the Seizure in this Ca&s;e; I am of Opinion, upon a View of the &s;everal Acts of Trade re&s;pecting this Point, and particularly the 7th and 8th William III, Chapter 22d, Section 20th, and the Statutes made in the 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th Years of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's Reign, that nothing, in the&s;e &s;everal Acts can be con&s;trued to lay any unnece&s;&s;ary Re&s;traint upon the Trade and Corre&s;pondence of his Maje&s;ty's American Subjects, when any Goods or Commodities are carried merely for the U&s;e and Su&s;te|nance of the &s;aid Colonies; or, in other Words, when &s;uch Goods are carried only from one Port or Place to another Port or Place in the &s;ame Colony. And fora&s;much as it does appear manife&s;t to me, from the &s;e|veral Proofs in this Cau&s;e, that the Ve&s;&s;el in Que&s;tion has been con&s;tantly employed within the &s;aid Province, without putting further out to Sea than her Burthen, or the Coa&s;t made nece&s;&s;ary for the Safety of her Navi|gation to and from this Port; and there is not the lea&s;t Shadow of Pretence, that the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el has at any Time been employed in any illicit Trade what&s;oever, or that any Fraud has been committed or intended, whereby his Maje&s;ty's Revenue can be dimini&s;hed or affected, or the fair Trader undermined or prejudiced, contrary to any of the wi&s;e Provi&s;ions of any Revenue-Laws, or Laws of the Cu&s;toms. I DO THERE|FORE, under the particular Circum&s;tances of this Ca&s;e, ADJUDGE, ORDER, SENTENCE AND DECREE, That the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el and Cargo are not liable, and ought not to be condemned and confi&s;cated.</P>
