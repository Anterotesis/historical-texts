<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t undertook this Let|ter, I had no further intention than to give information upon a mo&s;t important &s;ubject, for a few leading men in the great Council of the Nation; who&s;e great influence, if well directed, might give ea&s;e, felicity, and content, to the whole empire: But when I came to reflect upon the difficulty, which the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men meet with, to &s;tem the torrent of prejudice and delu|&s;ion, that the enemies of England have, with infinite art and indu&s;try, &s;pread through the land, I &s;aw it nece&s;&s;ary to be more particular in reciting facts, in order to rectify many pa&s;t errors; and &s;hall therefore now explain every alle|gation, for the benefit of any man who can read, or claim the lea&s;t under&s;tand|ing. I blame no Mini&s;ter, or State&s;man, farther than in proportion as he may

<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GIVE me leave to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you par|ticularly. I am per&s;uaded of your love of ju&s;tice and equity; and it is happy you live in a country ble&s;t with liberty; admitting every one to publi&s;h his &s;entiments, to give information, and even advice to the greate&s;t men, without the lea&s;t impeachment of their honour or under&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>This little piece may be &s;ingular; as it looks back to the fundamental principles of the con&s;titu|tion, and the very fir&s;t dawnings of Engli&s;h free|dom; it is meant to &s;upport the almo&s;t obliterated idea of Engli&s;h dignity, which has been long &s;ince dropt, or &s;hamefully abu&s;ed, by many political writers, and is almo&s;t buried in the rubbi&s;h of an|tiquity. But as the vigour of our con&s;titution, and the very exi&s;tence of the empire depends upon its revival, by mea&s;ures re&s;ulting from this noble prin|ciple; I, in the name of every well-wi&s;her to this country be&s;eech you, particularly, who are in|ve&s;ted with power, to pre&s;erve or de&s;troy the
<PB N="2" REF="011065_0006_0F854C81FB9094B8">
happine&s;s of millions, to weigh well the important point, at this very important moment, and &s;igna|lize your&s;elf, by uncommon efforts, to &s;ave this great and mighty nation, from falling a &s;acrifice to a &s;et of men, who&s;e de&s;igns are, fir&s;t to di&s;tract us with fatal divi&s;ions among our&s;elves, then con|&s;ign us over to our enemies, who have long &s;ince paid down the price.</P>
<P>'Tis nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to inform you, that, whatever I a&s;&s;ert I can prove; my intelligence comes from the very fountain: I have the &s;anction of men who &s;tand foremo&s;t in reputation, wealth, and in|fluence; my facts are &s;uch as the prede&s;tinarian mu&s;t allow to have been from decrees eternal, nor can time immemorial change them into delu&s;ion. But &s;uffer me to &s;u&s;pend the explanation of my plan, and keep back for a moment the conviction I intend to fix upon you, that it may finally &s;trike with fuller evidence, and leave the &s;tronger im|pre&s;&s;ions. And fir&s;t let me a&s;k this &s;ingle que&s;tion &mdash;Is there any method by which the enemies of Great-Britain can rea&s;onably hope to conquer, or de&s;troy us, but by forming di&s;&s;entions, &s;tirring up prejudices, di&s;affection, di&s;agreement, and divi&s;ions; which may eventually bring us to a fatal civil war, or render us unable to unite with &s;pirit, vigour, and &s;ucce&s;s in our own defence? This is their im|mediate intere&s;t; this is their be&s;t policy; this is the point they &s;hould keep in view, and what they are re&s;olved to effect.&mdash; Every good &s;ubject of the&s;e kingdoms, will reply, Mo&s;t undoubtedly, mo&s;t evidently.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="011065_0007_0F854C82C0B3EE80">It is known to all men, well acquainted with the world, and motives of their conduct, that invete|rate enemies may, from &s;ecret and ambitious de&s;igns, under the cover of &s;olemn treaties, or high enco|miums of e&s;teem, be apparently our friends. The Spainards formerly, and the French of late, have attempted univer&s;al monarchy by arms. The Spainards were beat out of that humour in 1588, by the lo&s;s of the general Armada: the French, by the battles of Hock&s;tade and Ramillies; but they then thought proper to eke out the lyon's &s;kin with the fox's tail; and, at Utrecht, they had the addre&s;s to unravel the victories of the war. The little remains of the &s;ame &s;pirit, then left, in|duced them to avail them&s;elves of the death of Charles the &s;ixth; they over-run Germany by the divi&s;ion of the princes, even to Bohemia; but were again forced to their arts, by way of treaty. They have &s;ince attempted to over-run Germany by &s;urpri&s;e, and were preparing to do the &s;ame in A|merica; but being beaten out of both, they once more had recour&s;e to treaties, and formed the late peace; by what means, and how obtained, I will not &s;ay; but thus, you &s;ee, the enemies of Great-Britain have played a game, ever by b*****y, &s;ucce&s;sful, and often exceeding their warme&s;t ex|pectation. 'Tis therefore contrary to common &s;en&s;e, to &s;uppo&s;e they will quit the cards, while they have every thing to expect.&mdash;No; experi|ence tells us, they have &s;teadily pur&s;ued their &s;uc|ce&s;s ever &s;ince the peace.&mdash;We know (but we dare not yet impeach)&mdash; has for &s;everal years &s;ince the peace, actually re|ceived

from the court of France, &pound;**** a year, for &s;ervice undertaken, and promi&s;ed to be executed, for them. But this is is no &s;trange thing; for there was an Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, formerly, who &s;tood a pen&s;ioner to that court.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the death of the Abbe De Boys, it was found that he had re|ceived a pen&s;ion from England; and among the papers of tho&s;e mi|ni&s;ters who died about the time when the parliamentary pro&s;ecutions begun, upon the famous South-Sea year, 1720. it appeared that one of them had received &pound; 16,000 a year pen&s;ion from France.&mdash;Nor is this a new thing; Philip De Comenes proves, that all the great men of England, and even the King him&s;elf, took pen&s;ions from Lewis XI.</NOTE> And though we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e there has been an in&s;tance lately, yet there can be no impropriety in looking back at the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued; &s;ince our artful enemies, before and &s;ince the late peace, have been admit|ted into our kingdom, and have ardently endea|voured to gain admittance into our councils al&s;o. I hope they have been di&s;appointed; for 'tis evi|dent, to every man of common &s;en&s;e, that their de&s;igns are to divide us, by rai&s;ing fal&s;e &s;u&s;picions, prejudices, and jealou&s;ies again&s;t each other; and &s;o di&s;tract us, by inte&s;tine quarrels, as to weaken our &s;trength, which, when united, is, by their dear experience, found irre&s;i&s;table.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By letters from many Engli&s;h gentlemen in France, &s;ince the peace, we have been informed, that the&s;e were their con&s;tant medi|tations; and when they &s;aw an approaching rupture with our &s;ubjects in America, even the common people exhibited the livelie&s;t &s;ymptoms of joy at the news; and the hopes of all were once more revived, that England would &s;till in &s;ome future day, be conquerable.&mdash; And, by letters from our friends in America, we are with the highe&s;t confidence a&s;&s;ured, that there came a French agent over to New-York, from the court of France, who, to prevent &s;u&s;picion, came by way of Hi&s;paniola; and, while the unea&s;ine&s;s la&s;ted, gave con|&s;tant intelligence of matters to his employers; and, no doubt had they got intelligence, that our &s;ubjects in America were once fairly divided and unhinged from the mother-country, they would immedi|ately have excited the whole body of Canadians to take up arms a|gain&s;t our colonies, while they attacked us in &s;ome other &s;en&s;ible part, either here, or in our colonies, and &s;o &s;ecured to them&s;elves u|niver&s;al empire; for, whatever &s;tate holds the provinces of North-America, may hold the full balance of power to the world, and give it laws.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="011065_0009_0F854C842866A2D8">I am &s;orry that I am furni&s;hed with &s;uch facts; but &s;o it happen'd, that &s;oon after the late peace took place, &s;everal per&s;ons of known integrity and tried abilities, grew every day more and more out of fa&s;hion. The famous Financier then took the lead; and in&s;tead of an eligible and con|&s;titutional method of reducing our debts and taxes, he immediately proceeded in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mea|&s;ures, which all tended to divide and di&s;tract us. He began with extending the exci&s;e laws over the makers of cyder; which &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e (for &s;ome men will believe there was a French influence prevailing &s;ome where, and cannot forget a former mini&s;ter's taking a pen&s;ion from that court) was but a leading mea&s;ure towards bringing the ma|kers of &s;mall-beer, (in their own hou&s;es) under the &s;ame odious laws; which mu&s;t have been attended with murmurs, and dangerous divi&s;ions; and thereby directly have an&s;wered the de&s;igns of our enemies.</P>
<P>General warrants came next; which, by their mi&s;chievous, dangerous nature, and fatal tendency, and the efforts made to e&s;tabli&s;h them as legal (which in their con&s;equences mu&s;t &s;o certainly have utterly demoli&s;hed every future claim to Liberty in this kingdom) leaves us no po&s;&s;ible doubt, whether our Gentle Shepherd had, or had not, adopted French politics; becau&s;e the Grand Monarch him|&s;elf

could never have devi&s;ed a better engine of &s;lavery.&mdash;But I mu&s;t lead you on, if not already convicted, to other mea&s;ures, which were equally de&s;tructive, and, if continued, mu&s;t have been at|tended with the &s;ame unhappy and dreadful con&s;e|quences.&mdash;Re&s;trictions on our trade.&mdash;He had the influence to fit out a number of our men of war; which, from the expence, parade, and mighty blu&s;tering in giving proper in&s;tructions, one might have imagined, had been de&s;igned for &s;ome grand and capital expedition; and though it did not a|&s;toni&s;h all Europe, as &s;ome preparations of this kind have done, yet it a&s;toni&s;hed all men of com|mon &s;en&s;e, who ever reflected on the con&s;equence, except tho&s;e few who knew the cau&s;e. This Grand Armada, for &s;o I choo&s;e to call it, as it re&s;embles the Invincible Armada, both in the motives of its out&s;et, and fate they met with; one was attended with the lo&s;s of the Spani&s;h power, the other with the lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h trade. One was de|&s;igned to en&s;lave mankind; the other, if there was any de&s;ign at all, to impoveri&s;h, and hereafter en|&s;lave the Engli&s;h empire. The brave officers of this &s;quadron, were now made (under oath) real cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers; not for England but for Spain and France; for, by this means, the French have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of a great &s;hare of this mo&s;t advantageous trade.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The nature of this trade with the Spainasds is this&mdash;The Spaniards who live in Mexico, where they work their &s;ilver mines, find it doubly their intere&s;t to purcha&s;e Briti&s;h manufactures from the Engli&s;h merchant, in our We&s;t-India i&s;lands, or in any of our ports in North-America; becau&s;e they can buy &s;uch goods as they want cheaper of our merchants than of their own; be&s;ide &s;aving the indulto or duty, and many other charges upon their money, which it is &s;ubjected to, if &s;ent to Old Spain.&mdash;They therefore take every opportunity po&s;&s;ible to purcha&s;e of us; and can any Engli&s;h|man be &s;o mad as to &s;top a trade, in which we receive in return, for every thing that we make in England, hard &s;ilver?&mdash;All the nations in Europe, who make manufactures, are exerting their utmo&s;t &s;kill, and go every length to &s;ecure to them&s;elves this lucrative trade.&mdash; None ever had it, in proportion to us, till &mdash;, at a va&s;t expence to the government, put a &s;top thereto, by obliging the Spaniard to purcha&s;e of the French and Dutch! The merchants here, who &s;end goods to America, are in a &s;tate, little &s;hort of bankruptcy; for our merchants in America, u&s;ed to make mo&s;t of their payments in this &s;ilver, collected from the Spaniard. If this imperious, head-&s;trong, ob&s;tinate financier, had meant to do his own country any &s;ervice, he &s;hould have taken ju&s;t the contrary me|thod. The men of war, which, if there had been occa&s;ion of &s;end|ing them out, &s;hould have been ready to protect us in this trade; the officers &s;hould have had &s;ecret verbal in&s;tructions, or hints to explain matters in this light to the &s;everal governors through America; that their utmo&s;t endeavours were expected to &s;ecure the trade from plun|der, which &s;ometimes happens for want of their authority. Thus every merchant and manufacturer in England, would have had punctual and immediate payment for his goods, and full em|ployment for double the hands he now employs; and many have been in &s;plendid, ea&s;y circum&s;tances, who are now, by rea&s;on of this fatal &s;troke, &s;tarving. Not a farmer, not a &s;oldier, not a &s;ailor, not a man of whatever rank in England, but now feels the difference. The rich, would have had more wealth, the poor hungry wretch would have had bread, and the man now &s;hivering for want of clothes, would have been &s;heltered in &s;oft wool from the chilling winds. Upon the mo&s;t moderate calculation, 'tis believed we have lo&s;t the &s;um of fifteen or twenty millions of dollars by this fatal mea&s;ure, which would otherways have come into this kingdom. A gentleman lately arrived from the We&s;t-Indies, declares upon his honour, that he &s;aw in one day &s;even Spani&s;h &s;loops come into St. Eu&s;tatia bay, (a Dutch port) with dollars to purcha&s;e European manufactures. He endeavoured to per&s;uade &s;ome of them to go to the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, but was an&s;wered, the Engli&s;h did not know their own minds, nor could they yet put any confidence in them.</P>
<P>N. B. Tho&s;e in&s;tructions have cea&s;ed &s;ince the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of our great Financier from office.</P></NOTE> Can any man imagine the

then mini&s;ter &s;o totally lo&s;t to common &s;en&s;e, and &s;o totally blind to the nation's intere&s;t, as to have done this under proper motives and influence? the the lea&s;t that can be &s;aid, or the be&s;t apology that
<PB N="8" REF="011065_0012_0F854C86DBFEF630">
can po&s;&s;ibly be made for him, is, that he wanted capacity and di&s;cernment. But it makes no dif|ference to the nation, whether our ruin comes by blunders, or by iniquity; the mini&s;ter who brings &s;uch calamities upon us, from either, ought to be re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>
<P>Our manufacturers, or Spittal-field weavers, in the mean time, complained that the French eva|ded our prohibitory laws again&s;t their &s;ilks, by fir&s;t &s;ending them to the ports from whence our laws admit &s;ilks, paying a certain duty, &amp;c. and prayed for redre&s;s.&mdash;Had they &s;trictly ob&s;erved this mini&s;|ter's conduct, they would never have given them|&s;elves the trouble to attend him in the manner they did; for they mu&s;t have concluded, he was too well bred, and too bu&s;y in pu&s;hing other mat|ters, to give them the relief they wanted; for they wanted a national preference, and laws to &s;ecure Engli&s;h manufactories, and Engli&s;h intere&s;t; and as they were ignorant of his de&s;igns, their expec|tations mu&s;t be acknowledged natural. But the manner in which he found means to di&s;appoint them is well known.&mdash;Our merchants applied for pay|ment of the Canada Bills, as agreed upon by the definitive treaty; but were put off, with empty promi&s;es, and the common-place profe&s;&s;ions of &s;in|cerity in office; the only thing they could ever obtain, and the only thing in his department of bu&s;ine&s;s, that he can, with any ju&s;tice, be &s;aid to be ma&s;ter of. At la&s;t, tho&s;e bills &s;unk &s;o low as 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> and were looked upon as lo&s;t; which were, in a few months after, by the hone&s;t nego|ciation of the men who &s;ucceeded this mini&s;ter,

fixed and actually paid, at near 40 <HI>per cent.</HI> and gives a mo&s;t &s;triking proof of his inability, or un|worthine&s;s to take any lead in matters of &s;tate.</P>
<P>But, to proceed, fre&s;h blunders were now me|diating (I mean in the Gentle Shepherd's admini|&s;tration; for he father's &s;o many, that his idea will ever &s;tand connected with blunders of &s;tate) he turned his wi&s;dom towards re&s;training the trade of, and taxing our Briti&s;h colonies; which indeed &s;tood in need of &s;ome attention, but of a contrary nature; for they had been at their full &s;hare of expence with Great-Britain, and Ireland, in pro&s;ecuting the war.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The line of colonies had in actual &s;ervice through the general cour&s;e of the late war above 20,000 men, which they paid and cloth|ed them&s;elves. The difficulty of rai&s;ing them, where the price of la|bour is &s;o extremely high, was very great, and mo&s;t of the colonies found it nece&s;&s;ary to give for encouragement every year from 5l, to 15l. &s;terling per man, to inli&s;t for the yearly campaign, for labour was once as high as 4s. 6d. per day. The debts which the provinces had to pay their own governments, ju&s;t as we do in England, made taxation on land much higher than it is here, and in &s;ome colonies equal in almo&s;t every thing el&s;e. There never was therefore a &s;tran|ger ab&s;urdity than pretending that the&s;e provinces &s;hould pay us for defending them, and till the late war they have ever defended them|&s;elves. Va&s;t numbers of their be&s;t &s;ailors were likewi&s;e con&s;tantly in our men of war, which obliged them to give 20 guineas per man fre|quently, to come only to England &mdash;</P>
<P>When Admiral Saunders was about to proceed for Quebec in the year 1759. he acquainted the people of Bo&s;ton, that he wanted a number of good &s;eamen, upon which, they immediately &s;ent him a great number of their be&s;t &s;ailors, who almo&s;t all continued in the Fleet till the peace took place.</P></NOTE> The late peace had taken mo&s;t of the articles of remittance out of their reach, by the re|ver&s;ion of the &s;ugar i&s;lands and We&s;t India trade to the French; va&s;tly in debt to England for ma|nufactures, in debt to them&s;elves for the large &s;ums i&s;&s;ued for the &s;upport of their troops; re|&s;tricted

by the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers of our men of war from their natural trade with Spani&s;h Ameri|ca:&mdash;but, in&s;tead of giving any relief to tho&s;e poor makers of brick (which might have been done by extending their trade to foreign markets) he immediately took away the little &s;traw they had left; he took away all their paper currency;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;udden reduction of this paper money was a dreadful cala|mity to the provinces, for they had always remitted all their &s;pecie, of gold and &s;ilver to England for goods. This paper &s;erved them for common circulation, and an&s;wered ju&s;t as well as &s;o much gold, where they took care to keep the &s;um within bounds. And if it ever fell in value, &s;terling debts to the northward of Virginia, were always paid in &s;terling, therefore the Engli&s;h merchant could not &s;uffer by it; they gave the very be&s;t &s;ecurity for redeeming it, which were lands, of the whole province, and it was to them ju&s;t as bank notes or navy bills are to us. Whatever therefore may be &s;aid in favour of a &s;olid medium, nothing can exceed the ill-judged time and moment of an attempt to take it away; for the merchants who owed money to G. B. had none left to pay, or any po&s;&s;ible method of getting it, in any &s;ea&s;onable time, but from among the Spaniards. This door was &s;hut up to them, as well as to us, by our wi&s;e mini&s;ter's officers of floating Spani&s;h cu&s;tom-hou&s;es. This has left our merchants in England, who traded to America, in a &s;tate little &s;hort of bankruptcy, and the merchants in America in a &s;till wor&s;e condition. Lands in America mu&s;t be &s;old to pay debts, ju&s;t as chattels are in England; and there was an in&s;tance in the province of New-Jer&s;ey, of one merchant &s;u|ing &s;eventy &s;hop-keepers for debt; the &s;eventy had lands, and their lands were &s;old at public auction for no more than the &s;um owing, by which means &s;eventy families were deprived of their &s;ub&s;tance for want of this paper currency. In the province of Connecticut, their provincial or governmental taxes and arrearages, were a year or two &s;ince &pound;80,000 to be di&s;charged within the year, and though the officers of government filled the jails with people, till they would contain no more, and de&s;trained upon every man's property, lands, hou&s;es, and chattels, they could collect no more of the tax than &pound;7000, or thereabouts. A true &s;tate of the whole may at any time be &s;een in the hands of their agent, Mr. John&s;on, now here.</P>
<P>The taxes were &s;o high upon the town of Bo&s;ton, that every man who appeared in a good way of bu&s;ine&s;s, or lived in a decent hou&s;e, was taxed from 10<HI>l.</HI> to 20<HI>l.</HI> per. annum.

<P>THERE are three things, in which I would be more particular than I could be in the &s;hort hints I &s;ent your Lord&s;hip, and without an intention to reflect on any one mini&s;ter, as I am ignorant who were the authors of the late mea&s;ures, ju&s;t

delineate them, as they lie in my own mind, for your lord&s;hips con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The popular cry was, That as we had been at a great expence to drive away the French, and &s;ave the Americans, it was but rea&s;onable they &s;hould refund part of that expence.</P>
<P>This pretence took with many unthinking people, who did not con&s;ider, that wherever the enemy made their &s;tronge&s;t efforts, there the grand expence would ari&s;e.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e this effort had been made in any other part of the Briti&s;h dominions; for in&s;tance, had they landed in Scotland, and made a rapid progre&s;s, as they did in the late rebellion; would you, after the war was over, have taxed all the counties from which they were driven, with a new tax, to refund that particular expence, on tho&s;e who, during the cour&s;e of the war, furni&s;hed a rea&s;onable quota both of men and money, exerted them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, and our whole expence centered again in England; as all the money &s;pent on our fleet, and in our colonies, certainly did: Doth not &s;uch a demand appear very ab&s;urd? Was not this expence in|curred to pre&s;erve his Maje&s;ty's dominions, and pre&s;erve our trade, as well as &s;ecure American property, and hereby &s;ecure our own, &s;o inti|mately connected with them?</P>
<P>What &s;ums have in the la&s;t war, been ex|pended to pre&s;erve Hanover? (which never re|turn to Great Britain more); do you, now the war is over, make a demand on them, or any of the German Princes, for &s;aving them from the ravage of the French?</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="011065_0030_0F854C93E41751A0">Why then &s;hould our infant colonies, labour|ing under their &s;everal provincial debts, con|tracted for the common cau&s;e, and who furni&s;hed men for every expedition, be &s;ingled out, and loaded with &s;uch a burthen? a burthen far &s;u|perior to their ability! a burthen which will eventually terminate on England; which every merchant connected with America, and the thou|&s;ands of manufacturers employed by tho&s;e mer|chants, mu&s;t al&s;o feel; under which they will groan, and by which they will be ruined.</P>
<P>Another thing is, &s;ending troops to defend America; which, indeed, has a great appear|ance of care over them, but really is as ab&s;urd as it is needle&s;s. To &s;end regular troops to a peo|ple, who in a former war not only defended them&s;elves, but fitted out an expedition, which &s;ucceeded in taking the French capital fortre&s;s of Louisbourgh, and thereby furni&s;hed their mother-country with a premium to purcha&s;e peace.</P>
<P>A people who, in the la&s;t war, without any regular troops to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, defeated the French regulars under De&s;kow; and, had they been timely &s;upported, would have drove the French out of Canada, without that heavy expence which is now complained of, and America, called on to refund; an expence which was chiefly occa&s;ioned by the &s;upine neglect and timid efforts of the mini&s;try of her mother-country, which gave the French time to pour in troops on the continent of America.</P>
<P>Can this people, with nothing but Indians be|hind

them, from whom they have defended them&s;elves an hundred years, when French re|gulars are entirely removed from the continent, have any occa&s;ion for regular troops to defend them? If they are not nece&s;&s;ary, it is creating a large expence, to carry and &s;upport an u&s;ele&s;s, nay, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, a di&s;&s;olute &s;et of men, to live in idlene&s;s among them, and deprave the manners of the people, which is of no &s;mall importance in infant colonies, where the utmo&s;t indu&s;try is nece&s;&s;ary to their own well-being, and their utility to their mother-country.</P>
<P>If the calling on the Americans to refund ex|pences neglect and timidity occa&s;ioned, and ex|pences which aro&s;e for the defence of his Maje&s;|ty's dominions, and the &s;ecurity of <HI>our commerce</HI>; and if regular troops are not nace&s;&s;ary for the defence of that people, the whole &s;y&s;tem of levying taxes falls to the ground, and there is no pretence for doing of it, in the violation of their charters; charters that will ever be held &s;acred by all true Engli&s;hmen, e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who&s;e forefathers fled into the wilderne&s;s, to avoid the intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion, and arbitrary power of the <HI>faithle&s;s</HI> Stuarts, who looked upon the people's charters as wa&s;te-paper.</P>
<P>It appears, the late mini&s;try were determined to load America with taxes, without any regard to their charters; this, they mu&s;t needs think, would &s;it hard on a free and brave people who&s;e liberties, inviolably maintained, would always occa&s;ion an acce&s;&s;ion of people to cultivate our exten&s;ive acqui&s;itions, as well as conciliate the
<PB N="28" REF="011065_0032_0F854C96A9E98DA0">
minds of the Canadians to an Engli&s;h govern|ment. Taxes would, I &s;ay, &s;it hard on them, e&s;pecially &s;uch as would impoveri&s;h the whole country, occa&s;ion great di&s;content and animo&s;ity; therefore, to &s;tifle the popular odium, and the ferment of above <HI>a million</HI> of an oppre&s;&s;ed peo|ple, and not for their defence, land forces were nece&s;&s;ary to be quartered among them, and crui|&s;ers on their coa&s;t, to prevent illicit trade; but, in reality, to keep the colonies in awe, and carry into execution the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, which &s;ome people have &s;poke out; <HI>The Colonies are growing rich and powerful, and mu&s;t be kept under</HI>; which, I believe, your Lord&s;hip has heard.</P>
<P>How ab&s;urd is this! Doth not, and will not, all the riches and power of the colonies centre in England, and make us rich and powerful? has it not really done &s;o already? On the con|trary, if you &s;tunt the growth of the colonies, don't you hurt your&s;elves? Is giving the dead pal&s;ey to the limbs, the way to promote the health of the body?</P>
<P>Whatever falacious rea&s;oning may be urged, there is a mutual intere&s;t between Great Britain and her colonies, which will ever unite them; while &s;entiments of liberty prevail, and are pur|&s;ued, and the mon&s;ter Oppre&s;&s;ion, bani&s;hed from the heart and head of an Engli&s;h mini&s;try, and they act in character as Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>Here is a continental connection, worth main|taining and cultivating; which, if duly improved, will furni&s;h us with the trea&s;ures of the South, and the nece&s;&s;aries of the North; that riches
<PB N="29" REF="011065_0033_0F854C97018F3B20">
and power, which alone can &s;ecure us, by a <HI>Family Compact of our own,</HI> which will bid defi|ance to the Compact of Popi&s;h Powers.</P>
<P>The la&s;t thing I &s;hall trouble your Lord&s;hip with, at pre&s;ent, is the equity of <HI>our</HI> taxing America; which I will fairly &s;tate as it lies in my mind.</P>
<P>All the colonies but Georgia, and Nova Sco|tia, were originally &s;ettled by per&s;ons drove from their native country, in tho&s;e reigns which, by oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;tained the glory of Britain; though, by the like oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, &s;he was &s;upplied with manufacturers from the neighbouring con|tinent, to our un&s;peakable advantage.</P>
<P>Yet, oppre&s;&s;ion was &s;o much the ta&s;te of tho&s;e times, that it drove out a number of the King's &s;ubjects, who took &s;helter in a de&s;art, that they might enjoy their civil and religious liberties, uncontrouled and unmole&s;ted. They were then in a &s;tate of nature, under no civil government but what they formed them&s;elves, when they had e&s;tabli&s;hed their &s;everal &s;ettlements, out of regard to their mother-country, they &s;ent home their &s;everal agents, to tender their new acqui|&s;itions to their mother-country, on certain con|ditions then agreed on by the &s;everal parties, and ratified by their re&s;pective charters, which they looked on as &s;acred, and make their boa&s;t of, like our <HI>Magna Charta</HI> of England.</P>
<P>If you con&s;ider the thou&s;ands that have been expended in &s;ettling Georgia, and Nova Scotia, you will better judge of the merit of the other colonies, which &s;ettled them&s;elves, without any
<PB N="30" REF="011065_0034_0F854C97BA6A7F90">
expence to their mother-country. Without &s;uch a &s;urrender, therefore, Great Britain could have no pretence to any authority over them; for the right was founded in compact; and the &s;ame compact that gives Great Britain any rightful authority over them, &s;ecures the privileges &s;ti|pulated in that compact; which is, the <HI>&s;ole right of taxing them&s;elves,</HI> by their own repre&s;enta|tives; in which all the charters agree, however in other circum&s;tances they may differ; there|fore, any attempt to break in upon their char|ters, mu&s;t meet with the &s;ame reception from them, as an Engli&s;h mini&s;try would find from the violation of our <HI>Magna Charta</HI>; can you wonder then at any thing that has happened in Virginia, or any of the other provinces, by invectives again&s;t a mini&s;try that violates their <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and deprives them of the privileges of Engli&s;hmen? an army, therefore, is nece&s;&s;ary to carry &s;uch mea&s;ures into execution, though not nece&s;&s;ary for the peoples defence.</P>
<P>It was always the ambition and glory of the Hou&s;e of Hanover to maintain the privileges of Engli&s;hmen inviolable; and it will be a &s;tanding mark of infamy on any mini&s;ter who &s;tains that glory, by the lea&s;t violation of them in America.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit to your Lord&s;hip's determination, which is his Maje&s;ty's intere&s;t; to rule in the hearts of a free people in America, as well as in England; or, by de&s;troying their medium of commerce, which they have found u&s;eful for above an hundred years, and by laying burthens upon them, which they cannot but look upon as
<PB N="31" REF="011065_0035_0F854C985FB6D9C8">
acts of arbitrary power; which makes them &s;laves, in&s;tead of Engli&s;hmen?</P>

<P>If the facts repre&s;ented to your Lord&s;hip ap|pear evident, and the rea&s;oning ju&s;t, their im|portance will apologize for this great freedom taken with your Lord&s;hip, in opening the unre|&s;erved &s;entiments of,</P>

<P>It is now received, as an undoubted propo&s;i|tion, that the &s;trength, riches, and influence of Great Britain, depend upon commerce: whate|ver therefore dimini&s;hes our commerce, mu&s;t impoveri&s;h and weaken our national influence.</P>
<P>Our commerce has been greatly curtailed in mo&s;t parts of Europe; and we have therefore only our connection with America to tru&s;t to, as the &s;ource of our &s;trength, riches, and feli|city.

Every thing, therefore, that interrupts and weakens the mutual confidence which has been remarkable for a hundred years pa&s;t be|tween Great Britain and her colonies, mu&s;t en|feeble the &s;trength, and dimini&s;h the riches of this country.</P>
<P>The advantages to be drawn from our Ameri|can colonies, mu&s;t ari&s;e, not from taxes of any kind, but from extending our trade. Whate|ver mea&s;ure &s;traitens and cramps our trade, can never be compen&s;ated by any taxation; nor can any thing be an equivalent for the decay of that mutual harmony, and friendly intercour&s;e, which are the nece&s;&s;ary cement of our trade with them.</P>
<P>So deep a &s;car was made with the late Stamp Act, as is not yet entirely healed. Making any fre&s;h wounds in our commerce, if per&s;i&s;ted in, mu&s;t unavoidably occa&s;ion painful &s;en&s;ations, not only in America but in Great Britain; and be felt not merely by the merchants, but by every manufacturer with whom they are connected; and no one corner of the kingdom will e&s;cape the baneful influence. To put any difficulties on our American trade, will inevitably dimini&s;h our exports to that country, from their inability to pay the merchants for the manufactures im|ported by them; which inability will be the &s;ame, whether the people in America re&s;olve to take goods, or not. The Governors and Judges being independent on the people, which mu&s;t render the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice precarious, will be a further di&s;couragement to trade, and will rai&s;e

fre&s;h, in the minds of the Americans, the evils that attended &s;uch a mea&s;ure, when their fore|fathers left this their native country.</P>
<P>When the merchants dare no longer venture their &s;ub&s;tance on &s;uch uncertainties, the Ame|ricans will be under the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing their own manufactures, though contrary to their pre&s;ent ta&s;te and inclination. To prevent them pur&s;uing this only re&s;ource and remedy, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t manife&s;t inju&s;tice, and as ab&s;urd as to make a law obliging them to go naked.</P>
<P>The only method to &s;ecure our mutual inte|re&s;ts, and effectually prevent the Americans thinking &s;eriou&s;ly of manufactures, mu&s;t be to encourage cultivating their lands, and extending their commerce, and thereby enabling them to pay for the various merchandizes of Great Bri|tain, which at pre&s;ent lie on hand for want of a market, and will leave thou&s;ands of our poor unemployed, ripe for tumults and confu&s;ion.</P>
