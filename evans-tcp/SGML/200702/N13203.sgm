<P>THE ma&s;ters of Rea&s;on have decided, that when doctrines and practices have been fairly examin|ed, and proved to be contrary to Truth, and injurious to Society, then and not before may Ridicule be law|fully employed in the &s;ervice of Virtue.</P>
<P>This is exactly the ca&s;e of the grand American Re|bellion; it has been weighed in the balance, and found wanting: able writers have expo&s;ed its princi|ples, its conduct, and its final aim. Rea&s;on has done her part, and therefore this is the legitimate moment for Satire.</P>
<P>Accordingly the following Piece is offered to the Public. What it is found to want of Genius, the Author cannot &s;upply; what it may want of Correction, he hopes the candor of the Public will excu&s;e on account of the fugitive nature of the &s;ubject: next year the publication would be too late; for in all probability there will then be no Congre&s;s exi&s;ting.</P>
