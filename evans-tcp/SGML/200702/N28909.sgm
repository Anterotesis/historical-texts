<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>AT the foot of the mountains which &s;e|parate Savoy from Switzerland, there lived, at the end of the la&s;t century, in a humble village, and a yet more humble cottage, a poor Savoyard. In his youth he had travel|ed through Germany with a marmot, and, by the exhibition of this animal's tricks and gam|bols, had not only gained a livelihood, but had al&s;o, by his extraordinary frugality, &s;a|ved a tolerable capital. With this he return|ed homewards, re&s;olving to build him&s;elf a little cottage in his native country, to take a wife, and to &s;pend the remainder of his days in quiet. As he pa&s;&s;ed through Swabia in his way home, he became acquainted with a poor but lively young maiden, who plea&s;ed him extremely. He made known his &s;entiments
<PB N="4" REF="038544_0003_10125323856A2390">
to her, his &s;uit was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;he accompanied him as his wife into Sa|voy.</P>
<P>After an union of thirty years uninterrupt|ed happine&s;s, &s;he died, and left him &s;ix &s;ons, the three elder of whom were &s;ettled in France in the bu&s;ine&s;s of cleaning &s;hoes; the two next worked in the mines of their own country; and the younge&s;t, as his mother's favourite, was &s;till at home. He was a &s;tout comely youth of &s;eventeen, and would, if bet|ter dre&s;&s;ed have excelled in appearance ma|ny Barons and Counts, and have engaged the attention of many fair ladies. "It mu&s;t not go on thus any longer," &s;aid his old father to him one day; "here, if you work like a bea&s;t of burden, you can &s;carcely earn dry bread; follow the example of your brothers, and go into &s;ome other country. They have &s;uc|ceeded by this means and &s;o did I, and there is no fear of your not doing the &s;ame. The &s;ooner you go, the better; I give you my ble&s;&s;ing, and for your mother's &s;ake, a dollar for your journey, and thus furni&s;hed you are &s;ecured from want."</P>
<P>The young Wolfgang, for &s;uch was the name which his mother had given him, ac|cepted the ble&s;&s;ing and the money, and &s;at out the next morning. The charming de&s;|criptions

this tender parent had often given him of her native country, had long excited his curio&s;ity, and he now determined to gra|tify it by going thither. Before he arrived there, he laid out his whole capital in mou&s;e-traps and hatchels, which he under&s;tood how to make him&s;elf, and which his father told him were a welcome commodity in every German village. The truth of this he &s;oon experienced. He perfectly under&s;tood the German language, and with the innate elo|quence of all Savoyards, knew &s;o well how to recommend his ware to the old mothers and the young maidens, that his capital was often returned in a week with rea&s;onable profit; be&s;ides which, he had generally a bit of bread given him, &s;ometimes a dinner or &s;upper, and always a night's lodging. By all the&s;e means he was enabled, as early as from Nuremberg, to remit two dollars to his father by a fellow countryman, who was returning home.</P>
<P>From Nuremberg he went into Baireuth, and wandered accidentally into the neigh|bourhood of the celebrated Fichtelberg, Here, as he came one evening, quite fatigued; into a village, he knocked in vain at &s;everal doors for admi&s;&s;ion, being every where, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, turned away contumeliou&s;ly, and was thus obliged to do what had &s;eldom happened to him, &s;eek his night's lodging at

the public-hou&s;e. Scarcely had he entered the door when the ho&s;t came towards him cap in hand, and expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t &s;atis|faction at having the happine&s;s and the ho|nour of entertaining &s;o illu&s;trious a gue&s;t. With a profu&s;ion of the&s;e compliments, he compelled the Savoyard to go into a little parlour, and, without paying any regard to his remon&s;trances again&s;t this, he called to his wife, who was in the kitchen preparing &s;upper for her &s;ervants&mdash;"Kate, give up whatever you are about! kill the fine&s;t chick|en! mull &s;ome wine! cook the be&s;t of every thing that you have in the hou&s;e! the long expected gue&s;t is arrived! make ha&s;te, and let nothing be wanting!" The ho&s;te&s;s wel|comed this news with loud acclamations of joy, and prepared to execute the&s;e orders with the greate&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>Wolfgang, who could only imagine that they were in &s;ome error re&s;pecting him, now &s;eized the hand of the bu&s;y ho&s;t. "Sir," he &s;aid, "you mu&s;t be mi&s;taken about me; I am only a poor Savoyard who &s;ells mou&s;e-traps and hatchels, and how can I, therefore, de&s;erve &s;uch a reception?"</P>

<P>The ho&s;t ran up and down, rin&s;ed the gla&s;&s;es, brought a clean table-cloth, and clean|ed the tin &s;poons with chalk, while Wolfgang &s;at, not knowing what to think of the&s;e pre|parations. He was often tempted to doubt whether the ho&s;t was in his right &s;en&s;es; but all the re&s;t of his actions, and particularly the accuracy with which he heard him in the next room, noting down to every gue&s;t his mug of beer, convinced him to the contrary, and increa&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>WOLFGANG, as &s;oon as he was alone, began to reflect on his unexpected good for|tune. He could not imagine how the&s;e peo|ple came to di&s;tingui&s;h a poor Savoyard by &s;uch kind behaviour, unle&s;s from &s;ome mi&s;|take, and only compo&s;ed him&s;elf by the re|collection of his not having by any means contributed to this. The &s;oft bed &s;oon pre|vented all farther reflection, for he fell into a &s;ound &s;leep, out of which he was fir&s;t awa|kened, late the next morning, by a gentle knock at his door. He aro&s;e, and dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf ha&s;tily, opened it to &s;ee who was there, when the ho&s;te&s;s &s;tepped in with coffee, and every thing proper for breakfa&s;t; hoped her gue&s;t had &s;lept well, and a&s;ked if he would permit a gentleman out of the neighborhood to breakfa&s;t with him. Wolfgang replied, that he had nothing to command here, and con&s;equently as little to permit; that a break|fa&s;t, as well as &s;uch a vi&s;it, was to him an un|de&s;erved and unexpected compliment, and mu&s;t entirely depend on the gentleman's in|clination to do him this honor.</P>
<P>The ho&s;te&s;s went out, and returned in a few minutes with a rather elderly looking
<PB N="14" REF="038544_0013_1012533C4DBBE268">
gentleman, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;uit of green clothes laced with gold. Wolfgang's embarra&s;&s;ment at the &s;ight of him was very great; he had never been u&s;ed to vi&s;its of this kind, and knew not what to under&s;tand by it. The only conjecture that &s;eemed plau&s;ible to him was, that this gentleman was come with the view of &s;etting the ho&s;t right re&s;pecting the incomprehen&s;ible error that he had fallen in|to with regard to him. It was therefore no wonder that he &s;tood quite confounded, and began to tremble, and, but from the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s that he had in no way contributed to this error, he would not have been able to &s;upport him&s;elf; but confu&s;ed as he was, he &s;oon &s;aw, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment, that his vi&s;iter was not in a better &s;ituation: for after making many &s;ilent bows, and then a profu|&s;ion of compliments, begging pardon for the liberty which he had taken, and &s;peaking of unexpected happine&s;s and honor, he re|mained quite at a lo&s;s; and endeavoured, by coughing frequently, to conceal his confu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Little as Wolfgang knew of the world, he &s;oon perceived that this gentleman was not come to threaten, or injure him in any way; and he waited quietly for what was to follow this extraordinary behaviour. He entreated the &s;tranger to &s;it down, who, in return, a&s;|&s;ured
<PB N="15" REF="038544_0014_1012533ECED31EC8">
him that he could not on any account obey his commands, till he did the &s;ame him|&s;elf. They then &s;at down together, and the bu&s;y ho&s;te&s;s began to pour out the coffee.</P>
<P>Wolfgang now learned from her conver&s;a|tion, that his vi&s;iter was a per&s;on of rank, and Lord of the Manor of this village; and that he had a fine ca&s;tle about a mile and a half from thence, where it was his plea&s;ure to en|tertain all foreigners.</P>
<P>The noble Baron, who&punc; as I &s;hall conceal his real name, will be called the Baron von Tiefenthal, confirmed every thing that the ho&s;te&s;s &s;aid, and added, that he would e&s;teem it a real happine&s;s and honor if Wolfgang would vi&s;it him, and &s;pend &s;ome time at his ca&s;tle. Much &s;urpri&s;ed as he had already been with the Baron's vi&s;it, he was now in|finitely more &s;o at his invitation; his amaze|ment was indeed &s;o great, that he had not power to make him any an&s;wer.</P>

<P>She withdrew, with a deep courte&s;y, and left Wolfgang to look into the box at his plea&s;ure; it &s;tood there for &s;ome time un|locked, but at la&s;t he opened it, and broke out into new wonder and tran&s;ports at the &s;ight of the &s;plendid clothes which it contain|ed. I &s;hould be too diffu&s;e if I were to de|&s;cribe all the awkward, comical proce&s;s of his dre&s;&s;ing; he was more than an hour about it, but was at la&s;t equipped like one of the fir&s;t beaux. He had on a &s;uit of blue laced clothes; his long black hair, which he u&s;ual|ly
<PB N="21" REF="038544_0020_1012534DD8C53B78">
wore twi&s;ted in a hard queue, was untied, and carele&s;sly put up with a comb, the re&s;t of it fell in ringlets about his face, better than any hair dre&s;&s;er could have done it, as it curl|ed naturally; a large hat, which, after the cu&s;tom of that time, was al&s;o laced and orna|mented with a feather, gave him completely the look of a cavalier; at lea&s;t, &s;o the ho&s;te&s;s a&s;&s;erted, who had been for &s;ome time at the door; this was confirmed afterwards by the ho&s;t, and, at la&s;t, by the Baron von Tiefen|thal him&s;elf, who embraced him, called him his newly-found, his &s;econd &s;on; and con|ducting him to the carriage, drove away with him with the greate&s;t delight.</P>
<P>Wolfgang permitted all this in &s;ilence; he really believed him&s;elf dreaming, and dread|ed awakening too &s;oon from &s;o agreeable an illu&s;ion. He was continually examining his fine clothes, or &s;troking down the ruffles of his &s;hirt, and felt the greate&s;t impatience to have an opportunity of viewing him&s;elf in a looking-gla&s;s. The Baron was very talka|tive, and often entreated him quite to forget his former rank. Wolfgang an&s;wered merely in mono&s;yllables, and fir&s;t remarked, almo&s;t at the end of their ride, that he had been ve|ry ungrateful to the ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s, and ne|ver thanked them for the generous reception which they had given him.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="038544_0021_1012534F738D8E38">"If you are &s;o con&s;cientious," an&s;wered Tiefenthal, "you may do this to-day, but perhaps you will be able to reward the&s;e peo|ple in another manner." As he ended this &s;peech, they &s;topped at the ca&s;tle. A &s;ervant a&s;&s;i&s;ted them both out of the carriage; and Wolfgang going up the &s;teps to the hou&s;e, by the &s;ide of his new ho&s;t, was carried by him into a room, where they found his daugh|ter palying upon the harp&s;ichord. "There, Loui&s;a," &s;aid the Baron, "I bring you a gue&s;t who has promi&s;ed to walk, and &s;ing, and read pretty books with you, to pa&s;s away your time when I am hunting."</P>
<P>After this introduction Wolfgang made &s;ome awkward bows, and would have &s;aid &s;omething of the favor and honor of being ac|quainted with her; but he could not arrange his ideas properly, and was obliged to leave it to her imagination to fill up what he had murmured in broken &s;entences. Loui&s;a, who had been already apprized of his arrival, paid her compliments to him, and congratu|lated her&s;elf on having the happine&s;s of be|coming acquainted with a man who was &s;o much of a traveller. "Italy," &s;he &s;aid," has always been de&s;cribed to me as a Paradi&s;e, and I hope to hear from you a more particu|lar account of that charming country." Wolf|gang, whom Nature had endowed with a
<PB N="23" REF="038544_0022_1012535222DF3B18">
good portion of wit and under&s;tanding, now &s;ummoned all his powers in order to make &s;ome reply to the fair lady. He a&s;&s;ured her, &s;omewhat diffu&s;ely indeed, but yet with a great deal of <HI>naivete,</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;ible Italy &s;hould de&s;erve to be called a Paradi&s;e, becau&s;e it wanted the principal requi&s;ite, a fair Eve; but that Germany ju&s;tly de&s;erved that appellation, becau&s;e he now enjoyed in it the happine&s;s of paying his re&s;pects to the faire&s;t Eve in the world.</P>
<P>Father and daughter united in admiring, and laughing at this &s;ally, and Wolfgang got time to examine him&s;elf in a large looking gla&s;s, to which he &s;tood oppo&s;ite. He found that, dre&s;&s;ed in his fine clothes, he was really hand&s;ome, and might very well perform the part of cavalier: this conviction made him vain, and le&s;&s;ened his ba&s;hfulne&s;s; he look|ed about more unre&s;ervedly, and fixed his eyes full on Loui&s;a's; &s;he was not able to bear this rather free look, and ca&s;t her's mo|de&s;tly to the ground. Wolfgang was a very fine man, and Loui&s;a one of the mo&s;t delicate of woman; but there was a &s;triking contra&s;t be|tween them, as will appear from the follow|ing de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>Wolfgang was in per&s;on tall, &s;trong, and well-made; his complexion was &s;un-burnt,
<PB N="24" REF="038544_0023_10125355BADD2B08">
he had a high colour in his cheeks, and large black eyes, with altogether a hand&s;ome face, and long &s;hining black hair.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a was rather little, her form remark|ably fine, if any thing rather too &s;lender, her hair very light, her complexion delicately fair, the colour in her cheeks pale, and her eyes of the cleare&s;t blue.</P>
<P>A &s;ummons to table put an end to their conver&s;ation. Loui&s;a pre&s;ented her hand to Wolfgang; but he, in&s;tead of accepting it, made a &s;ilent bow, and went out of the room before her, and &s;he followed, in the full con|viction that this mu&s;t be the cu&s;tom in Italy. His ru&s;tic behaviour at table was viewed by her in the &s;ame light; and informing her opi|nion of him, &s;he determined that when he was better acquainted with German manners, and had acquired a little French politene&s;s, he would be a very agreeable man, and high|ly de&s;erving her e&s;teem.</P>

<P>THE company at table had ju&s;t emptied their la&s;t gla&s;s of wine, in which the Baron and his daughter had once more drank the
<PB N="25" REF="038544_0024_101253584884EC68">
health of their new gue&s;t, as the &s;ound of a po&s;t-horn drew them to the window. A carriage with four fine hor&s;es drove up to the door, and the Counte&s;s von M&mdash; alighted from it.</P>
<P>The Baron von Tiefenthal, who never re|membered having the honor of a vi&s;it from her before, ha&s;tened with his daughter to meet her excellency. Wolfgang remained in the room, and was thinking, with great anxiety, how long this agreeable dream would la&s;t, as the Baron returned, handing in the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>All his former confu&s;ion was now renew|ed, for he knew not how he ought to behave to this lady, and yet &s;incerely wi&s;hed not to put his kind ho&s;t to the blu&s;h for him. Tief|enthal had in the meantime conducted the Counte&s;s to the &s;ofa, and turning to Wolf|gang, &s;aid, "Her Excellency the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;." Then turning towards her, and pre&s;enting him to her, "This," he &s;aid, "is a very good friend of mine from abroad, who will do me the honor of &s;pending &s;ome time at my ca&s;tle." Wolfgang bowed very profoundly to her, and to his a&s;toni&s;hment &s;he continued &s;tanding, and returned his &s;a|lutation in the mo&s;t courteous manner.</P>

<P>AS Wolfgang and the Counte&s;s got out of the carriage, &s;he pre&s;ented her hand to him, and he, by this time, under&s;tood that he ought to accept a hand &s;o offered. They went arm in arm, through the dark avenue, and the Counte&s;s di&s;played all her &s;en&s;ibility in admiring the beauties of nature, on which
<PB N="37" REF="038544_0036_101253760428F8D0">
Wolfgang let her expatiate without inter|ruption, for he was occupied with feelings of a different kind. His companion's arm lay negligently in his, and the novelty of this &s;ituation to him, excited emotions which he had never felt before. He now fir&s;t &s;aw, as his eyes wandered in&s;en&s;ibly towards her, that the Counte&s;s was a young and beautiful woman. Her large eyes, her full cheeks, and fine per&s;on, plea&s;ed him extremely, and fully employed his imagination. Might I, thought he, but once call &s;uch a woman mine, &s;uch a woman mu&s;t be heaven upon earth! I would willingly part with my laced coat again, willingly work for my bread the&s;e &s;ix years, if I might but one day have &s;uch a woman; willingly&mdash;But it would be tire&s;ome, if I were to relate all the projects which came into his head. Tho&s;e, who have been in &s;i|milar circum&s;tances, will be very well able to fill up the cha&s;m which I leave here; and tho&s;e, who have never felt any thing of the kind, will thank me for dropping the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Seldom, very &s;eldom, and that only in phlegmatic mortals, is love accu&s;tomed to come on &s;lowly, &s;tep by &s;tep: it comes on, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, in full gallop, &s;ur|pri&s;es the &s;ecure unawares, and generally wounds him mortally. Like the water-&s;pout no rain, not even a &s;ingle drop of moi&s;ture

previou&s;ly falling, announces its approach; the cloud bur&s;ts &s;uddenly, and the unprepar|ed traveller, finds him&s;elf up to the neck in water, and carried forward by the potent &s;tream, before he knows whence the power came which hurries him irre&s;i&s;tibly down in|to the valley. Any body is welcome to laugh at this &s;imile; it appears laughable even to me, and, neverthele&s;s, I &s;hall let it remain; becau&s;e a water-&s;pout and impetuous love have often very &s;imilar effects, both being de&s;tructive, but pa&s;&s;ing away again rapidly. The black cloud promi&s;es refre&s;hment to the thir&s;ty land, and always lays it de&s;olate. The lover hopes to enjoy the mo&s;t perfect felicity in the arms of his beloved, and &s;inks under the too abundant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the happine&s;s for which he &s;ighed.</P>
<P>But to return to Wolfgang, whom my readers left, like the un&s;u&s;pecting traveller up to the neck in water, or to lay a&s;ide my &s;imile, falling de&s;perately in love. The Counte&s;s, at la&s;t, quite tired of talking with|out having any an&s;wer&mdash;for it is very hard to find one&s;elf not attended to&mdash;was &s;ilent for &s;ome time, and then a&s;ked him, rather with a tone of reproof, why he &s;poke &s;o little, and paid no attention to what &s;he &s;aid? Wolf|gang took no more notice of this que&s;tion, than he had done of what had pa&s;&s;ed before.
<PB N="39" REF="038544_0038_1012537A12540058">
He looked towards heaven, and offered up a &s;ilent prayer that he might one day be ble&s;&s;ed with the object of his wi&s;hes, forgetting that &s;he was now by his &s;ide. His per&s;evering &s;ilence made the Counte&s;s ob&s;erve him atten|tively, and, not unacquainted with love and its &s;ymptoms, &s;he &s;oon decided that he was under the influence of that pa&s;&s;ion; and con|jectured that his imagination now carried him back to the beloved of his heart, with whom he was perhaps wi&s;hing to enjoy this glorious evening. As nothing is more tor|menting than a curio&s;ity to learn the truth of &s;uch, an idea, &s;he re&s;olved to gratify it; and her &s;peaking only being of no effect, &s;he took more forcible means of rou&s;ing him.

<P>IN the certain conviction that this was a me&s;&s;enger from the Baron von Tiefenthal, &s;ent to bring him back to his ca&s;tle, Wolf|gang followed him, and without ob&s;erving the way which they went, gave him&s;elf up to his own thoughts. The&s;e, as is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, dwelt entirely on the beautiful Counte&s;s. She had made &s;o forcible an im|pre&s;&s;ion on his heart, it was &s;o full of her charms, that he beheld nothing but her image.

<P>"When the poor &s;allen one perceived the con&s;equences of her folly, and mourn|ed it with the bittere&s;t tears and lamen|tations, the &s;educer &s;wore to be a father to her child, and left her, as he &s;aid, only to obtain his father's con&s;ent to their union, and then return to her arms.

the wretch if he would mary her, whom he had for&s;aken, and become the acknowledg|ed father of her child.</P>
<P>"With her I have followed his foot&s;teps till we came to this cottage, and here &s;he has given birth to a child who has no father. Nurtured with mi&s;ery, with tears in its mo|ther's womb, it died in the hour of its birth, and went out of the world a ba&s;tard!

<P>The &s;ight of the &s;uffering female and the dead child, with the har&s;h language of the injured father, had made &s;o &s;trong an im|pre&s;&s;ion on Wolfgang's ingenuous heart, that he wept bitterly, and inwardly cur&s;ed the author of all the&s;e &s;orrows as fervently as the wretched parent him&s;elf. It was now his turn to &s;peak, for the old man was &s;ilent, and
<PB N="55" REF="038544_0054_10125396DE88F0B8">
awaited his determination; but he was too much affected, at pre&s;ent, to attempt enter|ing on the explanation nece&s;&s;ary to his ac|quittal, and indeed felt that it would be in pain till the &s;wooning female was recovered. For as it plainly appeared from the old man's di&s;cour&s;e that her &s;educer was not known ei|ther to him or his &s;on, &s;he was con&s;equently the only per&s;on who could, at once, &s;et right this mi&s;take. As he began therefore to re|cover him&s;elf, and to reflect on what had pa&s;&s;ed, he waited anxiou&s;ly for the moment when her returning &s;en&s;es would enable her to &s;ee this error, and acknowledge his inno|cence.</P>
<P>But this moment came not. Tortured and debilitated as &s;he had been by all her &s;ufferings, this unfortunate creature could not &s;upport the account of her betrayer's be|ing walking arm in arm with another wo|man, at the very time when, according to her hopes and ideas, he was returning to her. This la&s;t blow &s;napped the thread of life; and while her father was endeavouring to &s;often the heart of her &s;educer towards her, her &s;oul was flown to a better world, there to receive a recompence for all its wrongs.</P>

<P>Self-defence and pre&s;ervation are me|chanical. Every one who falls, without knowing it, puts his hand before his face, as in the greate&s;t danger of being injured by the fall; and every one who is attacked, en|deavors to defend him&s;elf on the &s;ame mechanical principle. When the old man,
<PB N="60" REF="038544_0059_101253A4F3412F70">
therefore, aimed the &s;econd pi&s;tol at Wolf|gang, the latter &s;eized his arm, and &s;truggled with him for it. James ha&s;tened to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his father, and, at this moment the pi&s;tol went off, and &s;hot him through the head, as he was bending forward to lay hold of Wolfgang's arm.</P>
<P>James fell in&s;tantly, and, in his fall, ex|tingui&s;hed the light which &s;tood by Clara's corp&s;e. The old man had been thrown down in the &s;cuffle; and, not knowing that he had killed his &s;on, he called to him for help, and raved with the greate&s;t de&s;pe|ration.</P>
<P>Wolfgang, who merely wi&s;hed to &s;ave his life, not revenge him&s;elf, took this oppor|tunity of trying to make his e&s;cape. He had reached the door ju&s;t as it was opened, in a great hurry, by a pea&s;ant who lived in the &s;ame cottage, and who now came in with his &s;ervants on the alarm of hearing the pi&s;tols, with a firebrand, by way of light, in his hand. They forced Wolfgang back; and &s;eeing James in the agonies of death, and the old man &s;truggling upon the ground raving with all the frenzy of de&s;pair, on the murder of his child, it is no wonder that they took the former for the perpetrator of this deed, and, without li&s;tening to his ex|cu&s;es,
<PB N="61" REF="038544_0060_101253A7656C6220">
bound him, and dragged him out of the hou&s;e directly. They threw him down in the yard, and one of the &s;ervants was left to watch him, while the others returned into the room to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e within.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort interval, the pea&s;ant came out again, and ordered his &s;ervant to make ha&s;te, and put the hor&s;es to the waggon, and carry the murderer before the Ju&s;tice imme|diately. He &s;tood guard him&s;elf while the &s;ervant went to execute this order; and though Wolfgang earne&s;tly endeavoured to prove his innocence to him, his proofs made not the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the pea&s;ant. "Defend your&s;elf as you can before the Ju&s;tice," he &s;aid; "it is of no u&s;e your doing it to me. But it will be a hard matter for you to prove your innocence there. The wounded man is already dead; the old man lies in the la&s;t extremity, and will &s;oon be dead al&s;o. How it is with the daughter I do not know yet my&s;elf, but probably not much better, for &s;he is as cold as ice, and as &s;tiff as a board. It is very po&s;&s;ible that you may have the lives of all the&s;e to an&s;wer for, I would not take one of them on my con|&s;cience."</P>
<P>Wolfgang, who &s;huddered as much at this account as the good-hearted pea&s;ant him&s;elf,
<PB N="62" REF="038544_0061_101253A903453FF0">
now entreated that they would carry him either to the Baron von Tiefenthal, or the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;. "Both know me," he added, "and both will atte&s;t my inno|cence."</P>
<P>"Tell all this to our Ju&s;tice," &s;aid the pea&s;ant; "if he believes what you &s;ay, it is no concern of mine; I have fulfilled my duty, and wa&s;h my hands of it. But you may be &s;ure that I &s;hall openly witne&s;s again&s;t you what I &s;aw and heard. It is dete&s;table to murder any man, but it is doubly dete&s;table and cruel to murder &s;uch excellent people; and if you are the &s;tray bird, whom the unhappy young creature &s;ought for &s;o earne&s;tly, the Lord be merciful to your poor &s;oul! You will then certainly be damned; for the favour of the great is not current in heaven; the nobleman reckons for no more than the pea&s;ant there."</P>
<P>With &s;uch very poor con&s;olation the cot|ager entertained his pri&s;oner till the &s;ervant had put the hor&s;es to the waggon. Wolf|gang begged that if they would not quite un|do the cords with which he was bound, they would, at lea&s;t, loo&s;en them a little, as they ob&s;tructed the circulation of the blood, and occa&s;ioned him almo&s;t intolerable pain.

He now gave the hor&s;es a whip, and drove on to the left. The troop of hor&s;emen followed them at fir&s;t, and af|terwards took another route.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe Wolfgang's feelings is impo&s;|&s;ible. Of all the enigmatical occurrences which had befallen him for the la&s;t two days the dreadful incidents at the cottage, and his pre&s;ent extraordinary deliverance appear-to him the mo&s;t &s;o; and though he could only &s;uppo&s;e, as in the former in&s;tance, that they originated in mi&s;take, he perplexed him&s;elf in vain to find out from whence the&s;e mi&s;takes could ari&s;e, and becau&s;e &s;o confu&s;ed with a multiplicity of conjectures on the &s;ubject, that he lay, for &s;ome time, like a per&s;on in a dream. But, as his blood began to circulate again freely, and re&s;tored the full powers of his under&s;tanding, he gradu|ally lo&s;t the recollection of his pa&s;t, in the examination of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and, from the &s;ingular di&s;cour&s;e and behaviour of his deliverers, he &s;oon concluded that he was not in very good company. At fir&s;t he re|&s;olved to enter into conver&s;ation with his
<PB N="66" REF="038544_0065_101253B2C520ED60">
driver; but when he con&s;idered that, by this means, they might ea&s;ily di&s;cover their error re&s;pecting him&s;elf, and that this man might not be plea&s;ed to find he was carrying an entire &s;tranger, he thought it be&s;t to be &s;ilent. Reflecting then on the fate of the poor &s;er|vant, and the indifference with which he was murdered, he believed, not without rea&s;on, that the end of this adventure was to be dread|ed, and therefore determined, while it was po&s;&s;ible, to make his e&s;cape.</P>
<P>As he made this re&s;olution, they were go|ing up a &s;teep, woody hill. It was &s;o dark that Wolfgang could &s;ee neither the hor&s;es nor driver; and taking advantage of this fa|vourable ob&s;curity, he crept &s;lowly and &s;ilent|ly out of the waggon. They were then at the top of the hill, and to his great joy the man drove on very fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Alone, and without any knowledge of the country, Wolfgang &s;tood, for &s;ome time, un|decided what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue. At fir&s;t he thought of going back to a village at the bot|tom of the hill, through which they had pa&s;|&s;ed; but then recollecting that the hor&s;emen might be behind, whom he by no means wi&s;hed to meet, he gave up that idea, and &s;ought for a bye-way, which might carry him in &s;ecurity, either to the right or left of the
<PB N="67" REF="038544_0066_101253B53AF2CA30">
road. After groping forward for a little while, he &s;aw, notwith&s;tanding the darkne&s;s, a road open to the left, upon which he walk|ed forward as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. This became gradually narrower, and was &s;o &s;teep and rugged that poor Wolfgang laid down at la&s;t quite tired, glad rather to await the return of day there, than to go on any farther in &s;uch uncertainty.</P>
<P>He &s;oon fell a&s;leep, and did not awake again till the &s;un was ri&s;en, and gave him an opportunity of examining his new lodging, which was in a craggy dell amid&s;t &s;ome high rocks, from whence, in the dark, he mu&s;t have vainly endeavoured to find his way out. After clambering about now for a con&s;ider|able time, he came to a kind of path which led him from his rockey vale into one of a far more agreeable nature. A beautiful mea|dow, enamelled with flowers, and &s;urround|ed by a thick wood, lay before him; and the lowing of a little herd of cattle, which was grazing not far off, gave him hopes that he was near &s;ome inhabited place. Still trem|bling from the ye&s;terday's adventure, he wi&s;hed fir&s;t to &s;ee &s;omething of the inhabi|tants of this valley from a di&s;tance before he ventured among&s;t them, and with this view &s;tood for &s;ome time under a tree; but as he &s;aw no living creatures be&s;ides the herd,

<P>The maiden took a little ba&s;ket of cherries upon her arm, and went out without even looking at Wolfgang; who&s;e a&s;toni&s;hment, during this conver&s;ation, had exceeded all that he had felt before, and by no effort of his under&s;tanding could he form any conjecture that &s;eemed plau&s;ible enough to elucidate this my&s;tery. The te&s;timony of his &s;en&s;es almo&s;t convinced him that the maiden, who had ju&s;t left the room, was the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, with whom he had been walking

the preceding evening, and from whom he was &s;o unplea&s;antly &s;eparated; and the &s;ight of her rekindled in his bo&s;om the pa&s;&s;ion he then felt for her, and which the unfortunate adventure of the night had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but not extingui&s;hed. Several times he was about to a&s;k her the rea&s;on of her being there, and in &s;o different a dre&s;s; but her not ap|pearing to know him, and her generally in|different and even repul&s;ive behaviour to|wards him checked this inclination.</P>
<P>As he &s;till farther revolved in his mind the &s;trange circum&s;tances of the Counte&s;s being there in that dre&s;s; being &s;ent out to watch for him, and invite him thither; of her behaving &s;o kindly to him the day before, and now, as if &s;he did not know him; of how they knew that he would come that way; and how he, a poor Savoyard, could be of any importance to their happine&s;s, he became more and more perplexed. Unable to &s;olve this in any other way, he began at la&s;t to think that he was pur&s;ued by &s;ome ho&s;tile enchanter, who by his delu&s;ions brought him into all the&s;e unaccountable ad|ventures.</P>
<P>Some old romances, in which he had learnt to read, had rather given him a turn for the marvellous; and his heated imagina|tion

<P>In the meanwhile the old woman, who&s;e face nearly re&s;embled the phy&s;iognomy of a witch, as they are de&s;cribed in Feenmarchen, and other romances of the kind, was &s;etting the room in order. Wolfgang, who examin|ed her accurately during this time, took her for the wife of the &s;orcerer, and had ju&s;t re|&s;olved to be on his guard again&s;t her, as &s;he had fini&s;hed her bu&s;ine&s;s, and came towards him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER walking till he was quite faint and tired, Wolfgang pau&s;ed, and took off the mantle given him in the night by the hor&s;e|man who drove the waggon, and which he had from that time kept wrapped about him, and folding it up, carried it under his arm. By the height of the &s;un and his extreme hun|ger, he gue&s;&s;ed it mu&s;t be about noon, as he came to a more open part of the wood, which he judged to be near the end of it, and going on with renewed alacrity at this pro&s;|pect, he &s;oon arrived at its termination. The joy which this at fir&s;t gave him was of &s;hort duration; for on looking down a valley directly before him, he perceived, to his utter di&s;may, that he was oppo&s;ite the &s;ame hou&s;e from whence he had e&s;caped that morning. Firmly convinced now that he was enchanted and con&s;trained by the art of the old woman to return to this place, he had almo&s;t re&s;olv|ed to re&s;ign him&s;elf quietly to a fate which &s;eemed unavoidable, as he heard a voice not
<PB N="77" REF="038544_0076_101253CE94AF6518">
far from him; and giving way mechanically to his fear, he &s;prung into the thicket, and concealed him&s;elf under a bu&s;h. He di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the &s;ound of foot&s;teps very plainly, and looking &s;tedfa&s;tly towards the quarter from whence they came, to his great a&s;ton|i&s;hment &s;aw the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;ap|proaching, dre&s;&s;ed as a lady. She was read|ing, and walked &s;lowly, followed by two &s;er|vants, one of whom he immediately recol|lected as a&s;&s;i&s;ting to put him into the carriage the day before. A little dog, which was run|ning after her, coming up to his hiding-place, began barking &s;o violently that the Counte&s;s took notice of it, and &s;topping, ordered one of the &s;ervants to &s;ee what occa&s;ioned his making &s;uch a noi&s;e. Poor Wolfgang was now &s;oon di&s;covered lying, drawn together in the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible compa&s;s; and like a hair when it is &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;itting, looking at the dog, not knowing which way to fly; and the man returned to his mi&s;tre&s;s with the infor|mation, that the foreign gentleman, who was with her ye&s;terday, lay not far off under a bu&s;h.</P>
<P>"How, the Signor here!" cried out the Lady, and tried to make her way towards him. Now or never; you mu&s;t fly the en|chantre&s;s, thought Wolfgang, and cho&s;e the
<PB N="78" REF="038544_0077_101253D02CFAA218">
former. As he heard her drawing near, he therefore &s;tarted up, and ran into the thicket. The noi&s;e that he made betrayed his flight to the Counte&s;s, who called very earne&s;tly af|ter him, "Stop, Signor! only hear me! I have &s;omething very important to &s;ay to you. Indeed I will not a&s;k you what you were do|ing here!" But all her entreaties to him to &s;top, had no other effect than to increa&s;e his impatience to get away.</P>
<P>As long as I can e&s;cape this Syren's voice by flying, thought he, it is happy for me, while he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly endeavoured to get through the underwood. His purpo&s;e was &s;oon an&s;wered, for the Counte&s;s was not able to follow him, as her clothes hung in the bu&s;hes: and before &s;he could di&s;engage them, he was out of the &s;ound of her voice. He arrived at la&s;t, quite fatigued, at the foot of a high hill, which he mu&s;t either pa&s;s over, or return through the wood; his fear decided for the former, but his extreme wearine&s;s in|duced him to re&s;t a little before he commen|ced this arduous undertaking.</P>
<P>He had wrapped him&s;elf again in his man|tle, and laid down in hopes of getting to &s;leep as the approach of &s;omebody di&s;turbed and alarmed him. He looked up with anxiety
<PB N="79" REF="038544_0078_101253D3C0EDB390">
and &s;aw to his utter amazement that it was the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, as he had &s;een her in the morning at the old woman's in her pea&s;ant's dre&s;s, and with the ba&s;ket on her arm. Though he crept clo&s;e to the hill, (for he was unable to fly) it was impo&s;&s;ible but &s;he mu&s;t &s;ee him, as &s;he came along a foot|path, which he had not perceived before, di|rectly oppo&s;ite to where he lay. She &s;tared at him, and &s;tood &s;till in apparant irre&s;olu|tion. In order to conceal her embarra&s;&s;ment, &s;he began to tie her &s;hoe-ribbon, which had got loo&s;e, and glanced &s;ideways at Wolfgang as he &s;tood there in his mantle like a &s;tatue. He had now an opportunity of &s;eeing one of the prettie&s;t feet in the world; but he purpo&s;ely turned a&s;ide his head, to avoid, as he believed, a temptation thrown in his way by the devil.</P>
<P>When &s;he had tied her &s;hoe, &s;he &s;urveyed him attentively, but did not dare to advance; and he was &s;till &s;ilent, but involuntarily &s;tole a look every now and then at this charming creature. At la&s;t &s;he began to &s;peak. "Sir," &s;he &s;aid, timidly, and came two &s;teps nearer to him, "I hope I have nothing to fear from thee. I am ha&s;tening home, for my mother is certainly expecting me with impatience, and I entreat thee not to prevent my going."</P>

<P>"Go, in God's name! I do not de&s;ire your company! But do not betray me. And if you have any compa&s;&s;ion for the unfortunate, tell me the neare&s;t way out of this place."</P>
</SP>
<P>She now took courage, and darted by him as quick as an arrow. When &s;he was about three &s;teps from him, &s;he turned about, and &s;aid, "Sir if thou art the unhappy murderer whom they have been &s;eeking for to-day in the wood, fly directly over the frontiers; go up the hill to the right, and &s;traight down from thence thou wilt find the way, and may&s;t get there before night." Having &s;aid this, &s;he &s;oon vani&s;hed, and left him in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nothing was really more probable than that he was taken for a murderer, and pur|&s;ued as &s;uch; yet it &s;eemed much more pro|bable to him that this caution was only the deceit of the &s;orcere&s;s, who, by means of her colleague, wanted to frighten him into fol|lowing the path to the right, that he might come again to her dwelling, and at la&s;t fall into her &s;nare. He re&s;olved therefore to con|tinue his cour&s;e to the left, and rather to re|main all night under a tree&mdash;rather to die for want of refre&s;hments, than to go any more into that neighbourhood; and exerting
<PB N="81" REF="038544_0080_101253D8E92470B0">
all his &s;trength, he began to climb the hill. After much labour he arrived at the &s;ummit of it, from whence he overlooked the whole country, and &s;aw at his feet a large village, towards which he went, re&s;olved there to en|quire his way to the Baron von Tiefenthal's, and if po&s;&s;ible to obtain from him his pa&s;&s;port his clothes, and his wares, and then for ever leave a country in which he thought the wel|fare of his &s;oul in danger.</P>
<P>Near him as the village appeared to lie, owing to his fatigue, and accidentally taking the longe&s;t way, he did not get there till the evening. Wrapt in his mantle, and without a hat, for he had lo&s;t that, he knew not where, the night before he went into the ale|hou&s;e of the village, and &s;eating him&s;elf at the neare&s;t table, a&s;ked for a gla&s;s of beer and a bit of bread. The ho&s;t, an unwieldy corpulent man, who was &s;itting in an old arm-chair, was the only per&s;on in the room, and he let him a&s;k two or three times before he went out to fetch what he de&s;ired. At la&s;t he brought the refre&s;hment &s;o much wanted by Wolfgang, who ate and drank heartily, without ob&s;erving that the ho&s;t &s;tood by ex|amining him very narrowly.&mdash;"From whence come you thus alone?" &s;aid he, after &s;ome time; "and which way are you going?"</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>WOLFGANG lay weeping upon the cold damp earth, bemoaning his misfortunes, and prote&s;ting his innocence in vain; for no one was near to hear and an&s;wer him. The mo&s;&s;y walls indeed re-echoed his &s;ighs, but this afforded him very little con&s;olation. Far bet|ter than that was the &s;ucce&s;s of his efforts to &s;et his hands at liberty. The cord, with which they were bound, was accidentally loo&s;ened in the waggon, and the negligent attendants had not examined it, as they well knew that even with the u&s;e of his hands, he could not force his way through the two iron doors which guarded the entrance of the cave. He was thus able to wind them gra|dually
<PB N="87" REF="038544_0086_101253E7E116CB70">
out of their bonds, and render his &s;ituation by this means &s;omewhat le&s;s irk|&s;ome.</P>
<P>Though he had a hard bed, yet he had a quiet con&s;cience; and thus, in con&s;equence of extreme bodily fatigue, he &s;oon fell a&s;leep. About midnight he was awakened by a kind of dull continued knocking; and, &s;tarting up &s;till confu&s;ed with &s;tupor, he rubbed his eyes to &s;ee from whence this proceeded, but in the darkne&s;s which &s;urrounded him he could di&s;tingui&s;h nothing, and awaited, in trem|bling &s;ilence, the event of this noi&s;e, which &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the farther part of the cave, and varied frequently in the &s;ound. Notwith&s;tanding his being unable to &s;ee, fear kept his eyes turned towards this place, when, all at once, he heard a loud crack, and &s;aw a &s;udden ray of light which fell on the oppo&s;ite wall; and after the noi&s;e of &s;omething falling, as if not far from him, the light encrea&s;ed, and by degrees illuminated the whole cave. His hair &s;tood now an end, and he would have moved from the place where he lay, but all his faculties were cen|tred in his ears and eyes; he was otherwi&s;e paraly&s;ed with terror, and had not the pow|er to &s;tir.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="038544_0087_101253EA56B86BE8">A tall black man now came down into the cave, almo&s;t clo&s;e to Wolfgang, with a belt acro&s;s his &s;houlder, marked with &s;everal kinds of necromantic figures. In his right hand he carried a lighted torch, in his left a long &s;taff, and under his arm he had a roll of white cloth which he laid upon the ground. Another man &s;oon followed him, who ap|peared to be dre&s;&s;ed in white, and had &s;ome tools in his hands; but what they were Wolf|gang was not able to di&s;criminate, for he was nearly deprived of all his &s;en&s;es by this un|expected appearance. With the little &s;trength he had remaining, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the ground, and, with an agitated and horrible voice, cried out, All good &s;pirits prai&s;e God!' Scarcely had he uttered the&s;e words, before the torch fell from the &s;orcerer's hand, and he and the other man vani&s;hed directly.</P>
<P>The torch continued burning, and as Wolf|gang came by degrees to the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es, it occurred to him that light was better than darkne&s;s; for terror increa&s;ed with the latter, and le&s;&s;ened with the former. He therefore mechanically &s;eized it, and trembling, &s;ur|veyed his dwelling. At his feet lay the bun|dle, and near it a pickaxe and &s;hovel, which the &s;orcerer and his companion had le&s;t behind them. In looking carefully about to &s;ee if they were hidden there, he &s;aw the
<PB N="89" REF="038544_0088_101253ECC8FA7258">
opening which they had made, and through that the &s;tarry &s;ky and the moon, who&s;e rays then fell upon him. At this &s;ight the love of freedom, prevalent in every man, but mo&s;t in the impri&s;oned man, bani&s;hed all terror from the heart of Wolfgang, and he thought only of being at liberty.</P>
<P>Without knowing the contents of it, he took the roll of white cloth under his arm, and did not forget the pickaxe, in order, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this, to relea&s;e him&s;elf from his &s;etters. Holding the torch in his hand, he went through the opening, and came into a garden; and having now light enough from the moon, he threw the torch back into the cave, and ha&s;tened forwards. He had &s;carcely gone a hundred &s;teps before he came to an open door, and through that to a plain, the extent of which he was not able to di&s;cern. He &s;at down on the out&s;ide of the garden|wall, and &s;triking his fetters with the pickaxe the fa&s;tening of them gave way; and thus de|livered, he walked bri&s;kly along the plain. Being now de&s;irous of &s;eeing what the bun|dle contained, he untied it as he went, and found a very hand&s;ome green coat and wai&s;t|coat. The&s;e, thought he, are, without doubt, given me by the &s;orcerer with &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign, and I certainly would not put them on, if I knew how otherwi&s;e to get to
<PB N="90" REF="038544_0089_101253EE63BEAA50">
the Baron von Tiefenthal's. But, as I am ignorant of the way thither, and mu&s;t, there|fore, inquire it of &s;omebody, it is very likely that, in my pre&s;ent clothes, I may be again taken for a murderer, and as &s;uch, dragged anew to pri&s;on. It appeared probable to him be&s;ides, that he &s;hould be pur&s;ued as &s;oon as his flight out of the cave was di&s;covered, and that he &s;hould be known directly by the &s;ame means.</P>
<P>All the&s;e rea&s;ons were &s;o weighty, that they not merely overcame his fears of the clothes, but gave him courage to put them on, which he did immediately, and threw his blue-laced &s;uit, which &s;eemed to him at fir&s;t &s;o beauti|ful, into the next bu&s;h. He then walked on con&s;idering over the adventures of this night. That a &s;orcerer tormented him, and would for &s;ome purpo&s;e &s;educe him, no longer, in his opinion, admitted of a doubt, after the ex|perience of the la&s;t two days, and his having, not above an hour before, &s;een him face to face. Yet, that he could not mean very ill by him, as he always delivered him from the greate&s;t dangers, appeared probable, and of this he was &s;till more convinced, as he felt, by chance, in the pocket of his new clothes, and found a leathern pur&s;e &s;tored with twelve &s;ine new dollars, and &s;ix &s;hining pieces of gold. He had never in his life been the
<PB N="91" REF="038544_0090_101253F0D9408210">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;o large a &s;um; his joy was, therefore, very great, and if his con&s;cience whi&s;pered him that he ought not to keep the devil's money, his inclination to it per&s;uaded him, on the other hand, that one piece of it offered to the church, when he returned to his native country, would propitiate the whole &s;in. The power of the &s;orcerer was al&s;o become le&s;s terrible to him, &s;ince he found that he and his colleagues fled directly on his uttering an exorci&s;m. But then again reflection painted to him, in &s;trong colours, the danger of &s;taying any longer in this en|chanted country. A beautiful female and a large &s;um of money are &s;nares, thought he, that will conduct me &s;oon to the aby&s;s which he has prepared for me, and then &s;orrow and repentance will be too late.</P>
<P>The importance of the&s;e con&s;iderations confirmed Wolfgang in his intention of going to the Baron von Tiefenthal's ca&s;tle; and if he found him, as he had rea&s;on to believe he was, in league with the &s;orcerer, to get po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, by &s;ome artifice, of his own clothes, and, above all things, of his pa&s;&s;ports, and then to fly away by night.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e projects and re&s;olutions he had reached the end of the plain, and come to the borders of a wood, into which he did
<PB N="92" REF="038544_0091_101253F41C073778">
not much like to enter at this late hour; but yet the dread of being pur&s;ued, and &s;ooner di&s;covered in the open country, determined him, at la&s;t, to give the preference to the former. The moon was now going down, and his fears increa&s;ing with the increa&s;ing darkne&s;s; and the thickne&s;s of the under|wood making it difficult for him to advance, he threw him&s;elf down under a tree, there to await the dawn of day. Anxiety would not &s;uffer him to &s;leep; every little noi&s;e, even a falling leaf, was magnified by his terrors into a &s;ubject of alarm, that kept him con&s;tantly on the watch.</P>
<P>As the fir&s;t rays of the &s;un illuminated the country, he ro&s;e from his hard bed, and, in hopes of finding a road, &s;tole, like a frighten|ed roe, to the end of the wood, and looked to|wards the open plain which lay before him. He &s;oon &s;tarted back trembling, then rub|bed his eyes, and looked again, and trembled &s;till more violently. Willingly would he have per&s;uaded him&s;elf that he had &s;een wrong, but the third time that he ventured to look confirmed his terror.</P>
<P>The fatal hou&s;e, from which he had not been able to get away the day before, was now directly over again&s;t him. "Am I then condemned everla&s;tingly," he cried out
<PB N="93" REF="038544_0092_101253F6927192A8">
at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, "to wander about this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">cerer's hou&s;e! What have I done, that I mu&s;t go headlong into the &s;nare which he has &s;pread for my ruin? But if," added he re&s;olutely, "all the powers of hell unite to lead me into this enchantment, I will yet, as long as it is po&s;&s;ible, wre&s;tle again&s;t the devili&s;h tempta|tion!" Armed with this re&s;olution, he turn|ed quick about, and pre&s;&s;ed, on the contrary &s;ide, through the bu&s;hes into the wood.</P>

<P>A FOOT PATH, at which Wolfgang &s;oon arrived, &s;eemed, by his view of it, to wind down the hill as if it would carry him far from the hou&s;e. Plea&s;ed with this pro&s;pect he in&s;tantly &s;truck into it, and, after &s;ome time, was &s;o fortunate as to come to the high road, where he had not proceeded many &s;teps before he &s;aw a carriage, at a little di&s;|tance, coming towards him. To e&s;cape this he would, with all his heart, have run to ei|ther &s;ide of the wood, to hide him&s;elf among the trees; but, before he could notice it, a
<PB N="94" REF="038544_0093_101253F82E684F60">
dog, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> with the carriage, came bark|ing after him, and detained him, by bringing to his mind the ye&s;terday's &s;imilar adventure. He endeavoured, in vain, to keep him off, for his eagerne&s;s to follow him was not to be &s;ubdued, and had ju&s;t taken up &s;ome &s;tones to drive him away, if it was po&s;&s;ible, as the coach drove pa&s;t him.</P>
<P>"Heavens! that is the Signor!" <HI>cried a Female Voice.</HI> "Papa, the Signor is here!"</P>

<P>"It is fortunate for me that I have met with you, for it is entirely on your account that I was now going to vi&s;it the lady, who&s;e charms have made you quite forget your fir&s;t and &s;incere friends. I could not have brought my&s;elf to do this, if I had not con&s;idered it as certain, that the crafty Counte&s;s had expre&s;sly &s;tipulated with you never to come to my ca&s;tle again, and there|fore thought this the only means I &s;hould have of delivering to you my&s;elf the packet you left at my hou&s;e, which, I imagined, might contain matters of importance, and of &s;eeing you once more. The&s;e being the only objects of my vi&s;it, this unexpected
<PB N="95" REF="038544_0094_101253FAC8140610">
meeting gives me great plea&s;ure, as I can ful|fil them here. I mu&s;t own to you, at the &s;ame time, that it gives me great concern to have lo&s;t you &s;o &s;oon. I had indulged plea&s;ing dreams of the future&mdash;but they are pa&s;t; I am awakened, and perceive clearly that dreams are not always fulfilled."</P>
</SP>
<P>Wolfgang would have let the Baron &s;peak for an hour if he had cho&s;en it, without in|terrupting him, as he did not under&s;tand his di&s;cour&s;e, and had not courage to a&s;k for an explanation of it, as the meeting him in the wood, in this manner, appeared to him like enchantment. The Baron was now &s;ilen,t expecting his an&s;wer; but Wolfgang &s;tood, with the two great &s;tones in his hand, which he had &s;eized to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the dog, with &s;taring eyes, and not &s;peaking a word, awaiting the moment in which Tiefen|thal, according to his promi&s;e, would deliver him his property, the object, at pre&s;ent, of all his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a, at length, broke this &s;ilence. She was dre&s;&s;ed to-day more advantageou&s;ly than ever; and a more attentive ob&s;erver than Wolfgang in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation could be, mu&s;t have noticed that this was done pur|po&s;ely. A light &s;traw hat, which appeared, by mere accident, to be put on &s;ideways,
<PB N="96" REF="038544_0095_101253FE5945D170">
di&s;covered her light hair falling in natural curls. This hat, it is true, rather hid the langui&s;hing right eye of the fair Loui&s;a, but then it gave to the left a more exten&s;ive range for its operations. The fre&s;h morning air had over&s;pread her face with an agreeable colour, which was yet more heightened by the contra&s;t of her entirely white dre&s;s. Thus dangerou&s;ly equipped, &s;he &s;tood now before Wolfgang, and &s;hut out every other pro&s;pect from his eyes. "Signor," &s;he &s;aid coaxingly, and took his hand which &s;he held with both her's, "I have al&s;o abundant rea|&s;on to complain of your leaving us &s;o abrupt|ly. I al&s;o dreamt, like my father, of enjoying your agreeable and in&s;tructive conver&s;ation for a long time. I hoped that you would compen&s;ate to my good father the lo&s;s of his &s;on, by &s;ucceeding to his place. All the&s;e charming pro&s;pects are now vani&s;hed. My father mourns anew, and I have no more a brother! With you, dear Signor, it certainly remains to revive our hopes! What the Ba|ron would not venture to do, I, as a woman may, with more right to expect, at lea&s;t with more hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. As, perhaps, it is not mere chance that has brought us together &s;o unexpectedly, and as the pre&s;ence of the certainly charming Counte&s;s does not anni|hilate all the force of my petition, I venture boldly to pre&s;s you, to entreat of you to re|turn

<P>Loui&s;a pau&s;ed, and Tiefenthal, who &s;tood there full of expectation, like a General who has &s;ent the flower of his troops again&s;t the valiant foe, was &s;tartled and grew pale as he found all his hopes di&s;appointed, him&s;elf and his army totally defeated by Wolfgang's an|&s;wer.</P>

Circum&s;tances, that I am not able to relate, con&s;train me to leave this country as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; and I was actual|ly walking this way, in order to fetch my &s;mall &s;tock of clothes and the re&s;t of my things, and then forever to bid it farewell!"</P>

whi&s;pered to his daughter, as he handed her into the carriage, to a&s;k for a &s;imilar remem|brance. Loui&s;a fulfilled her father's com|mands, and the &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed Wolf|gang made ha&s;te to gratify her wi&s;h. It had rained, and in order not to &s;oil her hand, he looked for &s;ome clean pebbles, which he pre|&s;ented to her, with the wi&s;h that they might become precious &s;tones to ornament her hair. Loui&s;a received the pre&s;ent and the wi&s;h with many hand&s;ome acknowledgments, and Tie|fenthal once more repeated his regret at be|ing &s;o &s;oon, &s;o unexpectedly, &s;eparated from his new friend. But as Wolfgang made no other an&s;wer than by a &s;ilent &s;hrug of the &s;houlders, there was nothing left for the Ba|ron to do, but to order the coachman to drive on; and the man, giving his hor&s;es a whip, the carriage was &s;oon out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Happy as a poor &s;inner who has obtained pardon at the place of execution, Wolfgang now breathed freely, and &s;tepping a&s;ide into the thicket, began to unpack his parcel. He found there his Savoyard jacket, his pa&s;&s;port, &s;ome clean linen, his wares, and at la&s;t Loui&s;a's portrait very beautifully painted in miniature, and &s;et with pearls. Well plea&s;ed with the langui&s;hing maiden, who appeared to &s;mile at him, he looked at the picture for &s;ome time; but when he con&s;ider|ed

that &s;he was certainly the daughter of a &s;orcerer who per&s;ecuted him, he ca&s;t it away, and began to change his dre&s;s.

His hunger, which had been for &s;ome time very con&s;iderable, increa&s;ed on the &s;ight of the &s;moaking chimnies, and he re&s;olved to go thi|ther to &s;atisfy it, and then proceed on his way into Saxony.

<P>While the maiden opened the pur&s;e, and was looking at the gold and &s;ilver with great delight, Wolfgang &s;eized the favourable mo|ment, and, urged on by anxiety, clambered up the rock.

<P>AS it may perhaps be a long time before the poor maiden overtakes the flying youth, or may even be po&s;&s;ible that &s;he quite lo&s;t him in the thick underwood, I will, in the meantime, relate another hi&s;tory for the amu&s;ement of my readers, which at fir&s;t &s;ight may appear to be out of its place here, and to be as di&s;tinct from this as any other hi&s;to|ry in the world; but which they will &s;oon perceive to be very properly introduced, as having a particular connection with the &s;tory recorded in the preceding chapters.</P>
<P>Ten years previous to the adventures of our Savoyard, there lived, in the neighbour|hood of the Fichtelberg, a &s;turdy young vil|lage ale-hou&s;ekeeper, who had formerly tra|velled in many foreign countries as a, butcher,
<PB N="106" REF="038544_0105_1012541650E78F78">
but returned home, on the death of his fa|ther to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as heir, of this ale-hou&s;e where the old man had gained an hone&s;t live|lihood.</P>
<P>He married a hand&s;ome young wife, and lived jovially with her. His only employ|ments the whole day were, calling to her to go to the cellar when his gue&s;ts wanted beer, and &s;itting and drinking with them. He left the care of his farm to his &s;ervants, and never &s;aw his corn or his bea&s;ts before he carried them to the market-town to be &s;old, from whence he never failed to come home intoxi|cated.</P>
<P>That &s;uch alehou&s;e-keeping, and &s;uch farming, could only end in ruin, my readers of any &s;en&s;e will already have fore&s;een. I &s;hall therefore only add as a warning to the imprudent, that at the end of three years, the ineffectual dunning of his creditors was fol|lowed by a &s;eizure and &s;ale of his property; and that Jacob, for &s;o was this di&s;orderly ho&s;t called, being &s;till pur&s;ued by many di&s;con|tented claimants, cut him&s;elf a &s;tick from the next tree, and with this la&s;t remains of his he|reditary portion, wandered once more into the wide world. He left his wife and child as &s;ecurity to his creditors, who were really
<PB N="107" REF="038544_0106_10125419B20D9170">
&s;o compa&s;&s;ionate as to allow them a mainte|nance.</P>
<P>Entirely unu&s;ed to labour, and wanting &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, he begged his way into Italy as a Pilgrim, and laughed at the pious zeal of the fools, who &s;upported him in his holy purpo&s;e with plentiful alms, while he was in reality a heretic. Before he reached Rome, he fell in with &s;ome banditti who were going thither in company to the Jubilee. The ability of the man, his &s;trength, his intrepidity, induced this troop to accept him as a member, and ini|tiate him into their my&s;teries.</P>
<P>Jacob was &s;oon one of the mo&s;t adventu|rous and formidable of the Italian banditti. No one executed a murder, or any de&s;perate undertaking, with &s;uch cold blooded re&s;olu|tion. He was &s;oon renowned among&s;t his brethren for his great achievements, and wherever any hazardous enterpri&s;e was de|termined on, however di&s;tant, the German Jacob was con&s;tantly &s;ent for, who for double pay always undertook and accompli&s;hed the deed to the great increa&s;e of his fame. By the&s;e means it was no wonder, that, notwith|&s;tanding a life of plea&s;ure and expence, he &s;oon ama&s;&s;ed a hand&s;ome fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="038544_0107_1012541C243ECB18">His numerous murders having, at length, created a general alarm in the country, the officers of ju&s;tice were every where on the watch for him; and, as the de&s;cription of his per&s;on was circulated throughout Italy, he re&s;olved to avoid the &s;torm which threatened him, and till it was &s;ub&s;ided again, to return into Germany.</P>
<P>After &s;even long years, when his wife, wearied with fruitle&s;s &s;orrow and expectati|ons, had given him up for lo&s;t; when his neighbours and acquaintance never hoped to &s;ee him again, he arrived, dre&s;&s;ed as an opu|lent batcher, with a hand&s;ome cart and two fine hor&s;es, at the public hou&s;e of his native village. All the inhabitants, who &s;oon col|lected about him, were a&s;toni&s;hed at his re&s;|pectable appearance, envied his wife, whom they had before compa&s;&s;ionated, and were quite &s;tupified with &s;urpri&s;e when the often|tatious Jacob poured out a great bag of &s;e|quins upon the table, and calling to his yet un&s;atisfied creditors, paid them the principal and intere&s;t of his debt with friendly thanks.</P>
<P>The whole country &s;oon re&s;ounded with Jacob's return and great good fortune. Every one was amazed at it, and every one a&s;ked how he had acquired it; but no one could give any account of this, becau&s;e Jacob him|&s;elf
<PB N="109" REF="038544_0108_1012541E943A9AA8">
an&s;wered every que&s;tion of the kind with a my&s;terious laugh, or yet more my&s;terious &s;hrug of his &s;houlders. Often, when he ge|nerou&s;ly paid the reckoning at a drinking bout for his former friends and neighbours, and thus awakened their curio&s;ity anew, they importuned him to tell them by what means he had made his fortune. And once, when the alehou&s;e-keeper of a neighbouring vil|lage pre&s;&s;ed him more &s;trongly than all the others, and directly taxed him with having &s;tolen it, he wi&s;ely re&s;olved to mi&s;lead this man from his but too ju&s;t and and alarming idea, and to give him one le&s;s dangerous: "Neighbour," he &s;aid to him as they parted, "in order to obviate your unju&s;t &s;u&s;picious, I will relate my whole hi&s;tory to you, which I have not yet related to any one. You may perhaps at &s;ome future time derive the great|e&s;t advantage from it, and will then own with gratitude that I have rewarded you with good for evil. Come to me early to|morrow morning, and then, to you confu&s;i|on, you &s;hall hear every thing."</P>
<P>The curious ho&s;t came to Jacob the next morning; and fir&s;t begging pardon for his in|con&s;iderate prattle the day before, then claimed the performance of his promi&s;e. "I will keep to it as a man of honour," &s;aid Ja|cob,

<P>Jacob then began the following hi&s;tory, which he had devi&s;ed long before: and which as my readers, after the above relation, will know at once was entirely fabulous.</P>
<P>"Neighbour," he &s;aid, "you will recol|lect that people often come into our country out of Italy, who deal in mou&s;e-traps and hatchels, or &s;ometimes bring dancing mar|mots.
<PB N="111" REF="038544_0110_10125422CA4EB7B8">
You mu&s;t know al&s;o that under this pretence the&s;e people &s;teal to our Fichtel|berg, and having, from their &s;uperior know|ledge, the means of di&s;covering the trea&s;ure concealed there, they return home laden with great wealth, and laugh heartily at us &s;tupid Germans."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Host.</SPEAKER>
<P>"That to be &s;ure I know very well I have actually &s;een one of them &s;tealing about here. My father was alive at that time, and was with me when I met him in the field; he told me then, that one of the&s;e Italian hatchel-men had &s;aid once to his fa|ther, we were very &s;tupid people that we did not make a better u&s;e of the trea&s;ure which was laying about here every where. He had often, he added, &s;een a herd&s;man throw a &s;tone after a cow which was worth twice the value of the cow it&s;elf. My grand|father entreated the &s;tranger to teach him the art of finding out the&s;e trea&s;ures. He ap|pointed him therefore to meet him the next day upon a rock; but as my grandfather came there, he was terrified at the &s;ight of a great black he-goat, and ran back to his hou&s;e, and could not recover him&s;elf for a long time."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jacob.</SPEAKER>
<P>"It is very agreeable to me that you are already &s;o well informed on this &s;ub|ject,
<PB N="112" REF="038544_0111_101254266161DE30">
as I can for that rea&s;on go on with my hi&s;tory without digre&s;&s;ion. When I kept the alehou&s;e in the village; an Italian hatchel|man came to me one eevning complaining of a violent cholic, and begged for a lodging.&mdash;I pitied him, and out of true Chri&s;tian charity let him want for nothing. Six weeks he lay ill at my hou&s;e, and I took care of him all that time without any recompence. As he recovered his health, he expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t gratitude to me. 'I &s;hall never forget what you have done for me,' he &s;aid, at parting; '&s;hould any misfortune ever befall you in Germany, then come to Rome, and vi&s;it the church of St. Peter. We &s;hall certainly meet there, and it will be a plea&s;ure to me to re|ceive and entertain you in this manner,'&mdash;At the time I laughed at this odd invitation; but when my creditors &s;eized all my property, and were afterwards continually teazing me, then it came into my mind; and as I had no|thing more to lo&s;e here, I re&s;olved to try how far I might confide in this man's fair &s;peeches.</P>
<P>"I begged my way to Rome, and vi&s;ited St. Peter's Church every day, but never met the Italian, and had at la&s;t quite forgotten his promi&s;e. I was a&s;king alms once in a broad &s;treet not far from thence, when a gentleman
<PB N="113" REF="038544_0112_10125428D5FE66D0">
looked out of the window of a great palace, made a &s;ignal to me, and immediately &s;ent a &s;ervant down to conduct me to him. I was carried through many &s;tately rooms, the &s;plendour and beauty of which quite dazzled me, and came at la&s;t into a cabinet, where a gentleman in a brocaded night-gown &s;at up|on a &s;ofa, and was taking &s;nuff out of a gold|en box. After commanding the &s;ervant fir&s;t to reach me a chair, and then to withdraw; 'Sit down,' he &s;aid to me; '&s;it down, good Jacob, you mu&s;t be much tired with your long journey. How does your wife? how is your child?&mdash;I &s;tood perfectly a&s;toni&s;hed at this &s;peech, and could not imagine how it could po&s;&s;ibly be, that &s;o fine a gentleman at Rome &s;hould know me, my wife, and child.</P>
<P>He noticed my &s;urpri&s;e, and a&s;ked me, laughing, if I then really did not know him. 'No,' &s;aid I, trembling, 'I do not know your Excellency.' Without &s;aying a word more, he aro&s;e, and left the room. I had now an opportunity of examining the cabinet, which was extremely magnificent, being ornament|ed with a profu&s;ion of gold and &s;ilver ve&s;&s;els of various kinds; and I was tempted more than once, to put one of them at lea&s;t into my pocket.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="038544_0113_1012542A6FE57598">"After about a quarter of an hour the door opened again, and the poor hatchel|man, whom I once lodged in my hou&s;e, and had now &s;ought for &s;o long in vain at Rome, came in. He was in the &s;ame clothes which he wore then, and had hatchels and mou&s;e-traps upon his back. 'Buy a hatchel! buy a mou&s;e-trap!' he cried, as he walked up and down the room. 'Well,' &s;aid he at la&s;t, as I &s;tared him in &s;ilence, 'do you not know me yet?' 'I know you well,' I an&s;wered; 'but how you come here, how you dare venture into this room to walk about, and cry your wares, is a que&s;tion, that, with the help of all my under&s;tanding, I cannot an&s;wer to my|&s;elf.'&mdash;'But I will explain it to you in a mo|ment,' he replied.</P>
<P>"On &s;aying this, he began to undre&s;s him|&s;elf, by fir&s;t throwing off &s;ome fal&s;e hair which he had upon his head; and then run|ning out for a moment, he returned in his brocaded night-gown. 'Now do you know me?' he &s;aid; 'now do you believe that the mou&s;e-trap dealer and I are the &s;ame per|&s;on?'&mdash;'I believe it, I an&s;wered, becau&s;e my eyes convince me of it, though my under|&s;tanding is &s;till inclined to contradict them.' 'It &s;hall &s;oon be demon&s;trated as clearly to that, as to your eyes,' &s;aid he. 'Sit down by me, &s;it down; make no ceremony, and li&s;ten

to me patiently. The compa&s;&s;ion which you &s;o di&s;intere&s;tedly exerci&s;ed towards me de|&s;erves not only reward but confidence. In the &s;ame proportion in which I now place confidence in you, &s;hall al&s;o be your re|ward.'</P>
<P>'I am de&s;cended (he continued) from a poor, but very old and once re&s;pected noble Italian family. My father, from nece&s;&s;ity, &s;erved in an inferior office under the Pope, and when he died, left me without money, without friends, and con&s;equently without any other pro&s;pect than that of &s;tarving. I am not a&s;hamed to own that, like you, I once a&s;ked alms in the &s;treets of Rome; and was fed for &s;ome years as a poor &s;cholar, with the beggars' broth of the Capuchins. As I was one evening fainting with hunger and thir&s;t, begging at a very late hour, I met a hoary old man with a knotty &s;tick and a little lantern in his hand. He held the light to my face, and examined it narrowly for a long time, and then commanded me to follow him in a &s;olemn manner. I &s;hould deviate too much from the purpo&s;e of my narrative, if I related to you, circum&s;tantially, how this &s;ingular man, by degrees, won my affections. He provided me with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, in&s;tructed me in various &s;ciences, and at la&s;t took me into his hou&s;e: He was in &s;hort
<PB N="116" REF="038544_0115_10125430D2747CC0">
quite a father to me, for to him I owe all my knowledge, and all my riches.</P>
<P>'As he grew older and weaker, he taught me the rare, but in Italy not quite forgotten art, of di&s;covering trea&s;ures concealed in the earth; and of di&s;cerning, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t apparantly common &s;tones, precious &s;tones of infinite value. As he had always a&s;pired to the knowledge of the highe&s;t &s;ciences, and &s;till hoped to find out the &s;ecret of the bal|&s;am of eternal life, he had but &s;eldom, and only in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, made u&s;e of this glorious means of becoming rich with very little trouble. He died without having at|tained his object, and left me his writings, his in&s;truments, and a moderate &s;um of mo|ney. With this I immediately re&s;olved to travel about the world, and, by means of my ine&s;timable art, to collect a &s;ufficient fortune to pa&s;s away my life in independence and enjoyment.</P>
<P>'From the papers of my fo&s;ter-father I clearly perceived, that the German Fichtel|berg was the &s;pot where the greate&s;t trea&s;ures lay concealed in the bowels of the earth, and that this hill was al&s;o remarkable for a profu&s;ion of precious &s;tones. It appeared likewi&s;e, that by attending to the proper &s;ea|&s;on and, hour, it was extremely ea&s;y to get
<PB N="117" REF="038544_0116_1012543345146E28">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a portion of the&s;e riches. After the example, therefore, of many others who were in the &s;ecret, and who, as it was rela|ted in the&s;e manu&s;cripts, had already ama&s;&s;ed fortunes there, I went to the Fichtelberg as a hatchel and mou&s;e-trap dealer. But at your hou&s;e I mu&s;t have ended my life with|out having attained my purpo&s;e, if it had not been for the kindne&s;s and attention of your good heart, for my di&s;ea&s;e was extremely &s;tubborn.</P>
<P>'I &s;hall now recompen&s;e you for the di&s;|intere&s;ted compa&s;&s;ion you exerci&s;ed towards me at that time. I would willingly have done it at parting, for I had at that time great wealth in my power; but I feared to excite &s;u&s;picions in your neighbourhood that might prejudice me and any others of my countrymen who came after me, and thence prudently re&s;olved to defer the reward till a more &s;ea&s;onable opportunity. Without hav|ing occa&s;ion for more than common acute|ne&s;s, I plainly perceived that your hu&s;band|ry went on mi&s;erably; that you were plun|dered by your &s;ervants, and that your credi|tors would ultimately &s;eize all your proper|ty. On that account, when I bade you fare|wel, I invited you to Rome, in hopes of be|ing, able to reward you there without creat|ing any jealou&s;y again&s;t you, or any &s;u&s;pici|on

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>THE generous Marquis faithfully per|formed his promi&s;e. I lived entirely with him; he appointed me his Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, and I &s;oon became his principal fa|vourite. When any one wanted to &s;olicit a favour from him, they applied to me; and if I gave them my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they were certain of &s;ucce&s;s. You will ea&s;ily imagine that this kind of life was very agreeable to me; I had money always as plenty as hay, and took many opportunities of turning it to a good account. I mu&s;t to my &s;hame own to you, that in an eternal round of plea&s;ure I forgot my native land, and every thing that I had left behind me; and for years never thought even of my wife and child. But at la&s;t I grew tired of this &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation,
<PB N="119" REF="038544_0118_101254386AF96760">
and began to be very frugal and &s;teady, and to think often of my poor child and my for|&s;aken wife. I became in &s;hort &s;o unea&s;y, that frequently I was not able to conceal my tears from my benefactor.</P>
<P>"Several times he enquired the cau&s;e of this dejection; and when I could no longer withhold it from him, he promi&s;ed to re|move it immediately. 'I &s;ee,' he &s;aid, 'that you are become home-&s;ick; I cannot blame you for it, nor am I &s;urpri&s;ed at it, for I have been in foreign countries my&s;elf, and well know what it is to langui&s;h after one's native land. I love you, and would willingly have you always with me; but as my fir&s;t wi&s;h is to promote your happine&s;s, I will, without he&s;itation, &s;acrifice my incli|nation to your's. Come to me at the &s;ame hour to-morrow-morning, and I will, in the meantime, take care to provide you with a comfortable independence.' I left him, and no day in my life ever appeared to me &s;o long as this; I could neither eat nor &s;leep for joy, that I &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee my wife and child again.</P>
<P>"I was with the Marquis the next morn|ing before the appointed hour, and found him in earne&s;t conver&s;ation with his elde&s;t &s;on. 'Are you here already,' he cried, laugh|ing,
<PB N="120" REF="038544_0119_1012543B2E99D710">
as he came to meet me. 'Your ha&s;te clearly proves that I was not deceived in my ye&s;terday's conjecture. Go in peace; and that you may never experience any want in Germany, take this bag of gold with you; it contains eight thou&s;and &s;equins, which I hope will be &s;ufficient to &s;upport you and your wife and child decently.</P>
<P>"You may readily &s;uppo&s;e, neighbour, how I was &s;tartled at &s;o large a pre&s;ent. I could not &s;peak; I threw my&s;elf, weeping, at the feet of my benefactor, and knew not how to expre&s;s my gratitude. The good old man rai&s;ed me up, kindly a&s;&s;uring me once more that he would never cea&s;e to be my friend; and that I might boldly return to him, if through any accident I was again re|duced to di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. The young Marquis then putting in, &s;aid, 'Dear Jacob, I have a reciprocal &s;ervice to a&s;k of you. My father has revealed to me to-day that I mu&s;t &s;oon travel into Germany, and vi&s;it your na|tive place. There is yet much concealed trea&s;ure remaining there, which we &s;tand in need of for the further aggrandizement of our family. I &s;hall al&s;o appear in the cha|racter of a hatchel and mou&s;e-trap dealer, and &s;earch for the&s;e trea&s;ures. Should any misfortune befal me there, then, for the &s;ake

of my father's kindne&s;s, be you my friend, and I will reward it to your children.'</P>
<P>'Dear, dear &s;on of my great benefactor!' I cried out quite tran&s;ported, 'as &s;oon as you come to our village, put up at my hou&s;e. I will attend and take care of you as the apple of my eye. I will accompany you every where, and conduct you again in &s;afety to the arms of your father.'</P>
<P>'Thanks! a thou&s;and thanks for your good intentions,' &s;aid the Marquis, 'but my &s;on cannot take advantage of them. He mu&s;t not, during his journey, go to the hou&s;e of any friend or acquaintance; for if he did, the aim of it would be lo&s;t.

<P>The inqui&s;itive ho&s;t appeared now quite contented and full of joy, and was already building a thou&s;and ca&s;tles in the air. The cunning Jacob laughed within him&s;elf, and was rejoiced that he had &s;o completely de|ceived him, and could now enjoy his plunder in peace.</P>
<P>The &s;plendid pro&s;pects which the ho&s;t was now ince&s;&s;antly dreaming of, made him often mu&s;ing and thoughtful; he no longer worked &s;o diligently as he had done, but loved be&s;t to &s;it in &s;ome corner, where he might, without being di&s;turbed, bu&s;y him&s;elf with the idea of his future fortune. His wife was offended at this unu&s;ual behaviour in her hu&s;band, and re&s;olved to find out the rea&s;on of it. Whoe|ver
<PB N="125" REF="038544_0124_10125447B5828068">
knows any thing of women, will know very well how continually they plague their hu&s;bands on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and will al|ready have prophe&s;ied that &s;he carried her point at la&s;t. In fact &s;he was very &s;oon the joint po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Nothing oppre&s;&s;es a weak mind like a &s;e|cret, or gives it the fancied importance it wi&s;hes for, like being able to reveal one. Thus Catherine, for &s;uch was the name of our mu&s;ing ho&s;t's wife, was no &s;ooner mi&s;tre&s;s of this, than &s;he combed her hair &s;mooth, put on her Sunday gown, and ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle of the Lord of the Manor. She had &s;erved there &s;ix years as cook, with great diligence and hone&s;ty, and was for this rea|&s;on always well received in the family, and now hoped to acquire much greater con&s;e|quence there from the nature of her pre&s;ent errand. She went from the kitchen directly up to the apartment of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the ca&s;tle, and was conducted by her to her papa, who was no other than the Baron von Tie|fenthal. As he inferred from the importance of her look that &s;he had &s;ome weighty intel|ligence to communicate, he &s;poke very cour|teou&s;ly to her, and offered her a chair. This &s;et Catherine's tongue a going, and the Ba|ron was minutely informed of the above mar|vellous hi&s;tory. The Counte&s;s von M&mdash;
<PB N="126" REF="038544_0125_10125449543946D0">
al&s;o learnt it a &s;hort time after, much in the &s;ame manner, as &s;he was buying &s;ome flax of Catherine, and won her confidence by her affable behaviour.</P>
<P>Ho&s;t, Baron, and Counte&s;s, now all fabri|cated their particular plans how to decoy the young Marquis, when he appeared, as a hatchel and mou&s;e-trap dealer, in their neighbourhood; and to entitle them&s;elves, by the mo&s;t attentive beneficence, to a part, or perhaps the whole, of his great trea&s;ures. By Catherine's prudent management &s;he per|&s;uaded her hu&s;band to reveal the &s;ecret, that he knew already, to the Baron; and the Ba|ron prevailed on the ho&s;t to promi&s;e, that he &s;hould have immediate information of the ar|rival of the young Marquis.</P>
<P>The Baron von Tiefenthal was the eco|nomical &s;on of a very extravagant father, and it was with difficulty that he could &s;upport his &s;ituation with an inheritance encumber|ed with the debts of the latter. He was ve|ry naturally therefore extremely rejoiced that &s;o fortunate an opportunity was likely to be pre&s;ented to him of di&s;encumbering his e&s;tate. His daughter was now marriageable, and who can blame the good father that he wi&s;h|ed to bring about a match between her and the rich Marquis? and the more certainly
<PB N="127" REF="038544_0126_1012544BC564CC60">
to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e, he confided his whole plan to her beforehand.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s von M&mdash; was the lively widow of an old di&s;agreeable hu&s;band, who, to her great joy, died &s;oon after their marri|age, and left her the unlimited po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large fortune. Being much inclined to &s;how, luxury, and di&s;&s;ipation, &s;he had, with|in two years, nearly run through this for|tune, when &s;he heard from the good natured ho&s;te&s;s this lucky &s;ecret. It was therefore equally natural that &s;he &s;hould al&s;o devi&s;e every means to decoy the expected Marquis to her&s;elf, and thus hope to &s;ecure an inex|hau&s;tible &s;ource of riches.</P>
<P>In her early youth the Counte&s;s had ten|derly loved, and been beloved by, a hand|&s;ome Lieutenant; and in con&s;equence of this amour, at &s;eventeen &s;he became the mother of a daughter, who&s;e birth was &s;o carefully concealed that the Counte&s;s was never &s;u&s;|pected, though &s;he remained at her father's hou&s;e. The child was immediately com|mitted to the care of a poor par&s;on's widow.</P>
<P>When the Counte&s;s became a widow her&s;elf, &s;he took her daughter and this old woman to live near her; for notwith&s;tand|ing the general giddine&s;s of her character,
<PB N="128" REF="038544_0127_1012544F5A564F40">
&s;he loved the former with maternal affection. This child of love, who&s;e name was Emily, was extremely like her mother; but with|out making any remarks on this &s;triking re&s;emblance, &s;he was unanimou&s;ly held, by the good natured pea&s;ants, to be the daugh|ter of the par&s;on's widow; and in order to avoid more critical ob&s;ervers, &s;he lived with her in a retired cottage built for them by the Counte&s;s in her park; to which, after the death of her hu&s;band, &s;he had added part of a neighbouring wood.</P>
<P>The real mother of this child, who wi&s;hed to e&s;tabli&s;h her darling re&s;pectably, thought the pre&s;ent a fine opportunity to endeavour to accompli&s;h her object; and by throwing her in his way, hoped that &s;he might capti|vate the inexperienced Marquis. With this view, Emily had been &s;ent every day du|ring the whole &s;ummer, to the &s;ummit of the Fichtelberg, to await his coming, and, by the in&s;tructions of her mother, &s;he was to do all in her power to attract and detain him.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ituation of affairs when the innocent Wolfgang arrived in this country. By all tho&s;e who were intere&s;ted in the com|ing
<PB N="129" REF="038544_0128_10125451CF4C1B70">
of the expected Marquis, he was taken for him, and for this rea&s;on was received by them with &s;o much honour.</P>
<P>It is now certain that no &s;orcerer deluded him when he thought he &s;aw the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, &s;ometimes as a fine lady, and &s;ometimes as a pea&s;ant girl. Nor was it more extraordinary, when he was in a park laid out after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion, that he &s;hould by various ways, con&s;tantly come again to the hou&s;e &s;ituated at the end of it and to which all the&s;e ways purpo&s;ely led.</P>
<P>But then who was the old man whom Wolfgang &s;o unde&s;ignedly murdered? Who the poor for&s;aken female? Who were the hor&s;emen who relea&s;ed him the fir&s;t time? And who the &s;orcerer who relea&s;ed him the &s;econd time out of captivity?</P>
<P>The&s;e que&s;tions I cannot po&s;&s;ibly an&s;wer now. The time will come when my rea|ders will learn every thing; but the where and the when I mu&s;t leave undetermined; becau&s;e the little Atalante has overtaken the panting Wolfgang, notwith&s;tanding his great advantage of her, and is holding him fa&s;t by the arm. And it is proper now to li&s;ten to

In running he had &s;tumbled over a &s;tick, and, though he had indeed endeavoured to per&s;erve his balance, after tottering up and down for &s;ome time, like a nine-pin when it is touched by the ball, the di&s;proportion of gravity at la&s;t drew him backwards to the ground: he fell among&s;t the ela&s;tic branches of &s;ome young beeches, which rocked him up and down, and made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to ri&s;e, be|cau&s;e every &s;upport which he caught at was too weak, and let him &s;ink again.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="038544_0131_10125459754AC2E0">In this &s;ituation the pur&s;uing dam&s;el over|took him. She laid hold of his arm, but prudently did not draw him from it, as he was now no longer able to fly, but remained in her power. In running after him the bu&s;hes had often caught her; one of them had half torn off her handerkerchief, another &s;natched it quite away; but entirely occu|pied with the de&s;ire to overtake the flying youth, &s;he perceived nothing of this. But as Wolfgang uncovered his eyes, and from an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e drew her towards him, and boldly &s;natched a ki&s;s, &s;he became at once &s;en&s;ible of her lo&s;s, and &s;pringing from his arms with all her &s;trength, in extreme confu&s;ion turned her back to him.</P>
<P>It would have been ea&s;y for him now to fly, but the tables were turned, and at this moment, if the maiden had flown, Wolfgang would have followed her, as a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly as &s;he had followed him before. Devils and &s;orcery were altogether vani&s;hed from his re|membrance, and he thought only of the hea|ven in the dam&s;el's arms.

<PB N="136" REF="038544_0135_10125463934B29C8">

<P>Wolfgang was very glad, from this relati|on, to be more and more confirmed in his conjecture, that his &s;uppo&s;ition about the devil and &s;orcery had been an error. Cer|tainly, he thought, as the Counte&s;s von M&mdash; and this maiden are different per&s;ons, the other &s;orcerer-like adventures may probably have ari&s;en from equally natural cau&s;es. Wi&s;hing to inve&s;tigate this &s;till more clearly, he re&s;olved to continue his que&s;tions; and hoped from the information of his beloved maiden, to obtain &s;atisfactory explanations on the&s;e heads. He was ju&s;t going to a&s;k how it could po&s;&s;ibly be, that from various,
<PB N="138" REF="038544_0137_10125467A32A5990">
and apparently contrary ways, he always returned to the &s;ame hou&s;e, from which he believed him&s;elf far di&s;tant, when all at once a great noi&s;e behind them caught his attenti|on. He turned about in&s;tantly, and &s;aw two men in ma&s;ks &s;tanding before him. "We have you at la&s;t, my Lord Marquis!" they called out, jeeringly; and before Wolfgang could recover him&s;elf, and make any an&s;wer, one of them &s;tabbed him twice in the body with a dagger, and then they both made their e&s;cape into the thicket.</P>
<P>Wolfgang &s;unk, rattling in the throat, to the earth; his eyes clo&s;ed, and the afflicted de&s;pairing Emily &s;oon &s;aw no &s;igns of life in him. She at la&s;t recollected, that if it were po&s;&s;ible for any a&s;&s;i&s;tance yet to be of &s;ervice to him, her mother, who had &s;ome &s;kill in the u&s;e of certain herbs, was mo&s;t likely to render it efficaciou&s;ly. She ha&s;tened there|fore, to her, and &s;oon returned, weeping and out of breath, with the old woman. As they came to the place where Wolfgang was at|tacked by the murderers, a profu&s;ion of blood plainly pointed out where he had lain; but the body was gone. They perceived a bloody track from this &s;pot, which they followed, and it led them down through the thicket, and brought them at no great di&s;tance to the edge of the &s;haft of an old mine, where the

<P>Emily and the old woman &s;tood for &s;ome time quite di&s;con&s;olate by the &s;ide of this hor|rible grave.

The fear that the murderers might return once more and plunge them, as evidence of their guilt, into the dreadful aby&s;s, at length rou&s;ed the old woman to think of returning; and Emily, entirely ab&s;orbed in her &s;orrow, followed her in &s;ilence.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN Wildner became a &s;oldier ra|ther from nece&s;&s;ity than inclination; becau&s;e
<PB N="140" REF="038544_0139_1012552D2C38D8B8">
his father, Colonel Wildner, though he left behind him a high reputation for courage and integrity, &s;carcely left a pittance of for|tune &s;ufficient to pay the expences of his funeral. The &s;on, who had always main|tained as di&s;tingui&s;hed a character for virtue and bravery as the father, at forty years old had only ri&s;en to the rank of Captain. With the &s;omewhat more liberal income which he then enjoyed, he began to feel in its full force the truth of the &s;aying, "That it is not good for man to be alone." He &s;ought therefore for a helpmate among&s;t the daughters of the land, and &s;oon found one in the per&s;on of a par&s;on's daughter, who was indeed poor in worldly wealth, but rich in the qualities which mo&s;t la&s;tingly &s;ecure the happine&s;s of the marriage &s;tate.</P>
<P>Wildner began fir&s;t to live in her &s;ociety, and his wife and two children became &s;o dear to him, that he would not have exchang|ed his &s;ituation for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of kingdoms. After a few years of enjoyment, a war, which de&s;olated his native land, tore him from the only ble&s;&s;ing that the world had ever afforded him, and which he re&s;igned, on the call of duty, with infinite reluctance.</P>
<P>When he returned home for the fir&s;t time, after an ab&s;ence of ten years, he found his
<PB N="141" REF="038544_0140_101229C75B0A2A38">
wife dead, and his two children, a boy and girl, under the care of a near relation, who&s;e extraordinary kindne&s;s to his for&s;aken wife and babes gave &s;ome con&s;olation to the af|flicted hu&s;band. As the&s;e children were nearly grown up, the father took his &s;on with him, to join the army now ready to march, to oppo&s;e an enemy which had ju&s;t rekindled the flame of war again&s;t his coun|try. His daughter, an almo&s;t perfect model of con&s;ummate beauty, and with a mind of the mo&s;t untainted innocence, continued un|der the protection of her &s;econd mother; and nothing but the hope that the welfare of his darling would be &s;ecure under &s;uch protecti|on, could have enabled the father to &s;upport this &s;eparation with any fortitude.</P>
<P>The fo&s;ter-mother of Clara had hitherto lived in the town; but longing for quiet, a not unnatural con&s;equence of age, &s;he moved into a neighbouring village, and there, in the calm of &s;olitude, devoted the remainder of her days to God. Clara accompanied her thither, and from her gentle &s;entimen|tal character, &s;oon found a thou&s;and plea&s;ures in the country, that &s;he had never felt in the town. It was a luxury to the native &s;im|plicity of her &s;oul, to leave her downy pillow early in the morning, and contemplate, from an adjoining hill, the maje&s;tic ri&s;ing of the
<PB N="142" REF="038544_0141_101229C900E3A558">
&s;un. Her heart expanded, with the reviving animation of nature, to the &s;ublime&s;t emoti|ons of delight. She adored the omnipotence of God in this glorious picture; &s;he wor&s;hip|ped him in every blade of gra&s;s, and in every drop of dew which &s;hone like chry&s;tal upon its delicate texture and vivid hue.</P>
<P>Nothing opens the heart, and awakens every dormant feeling in the human &s;oul, to a &s;tate &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ion, as the &s;e|rene beauty of &s;uch a morning. Every thing lives, every thing moves, every thing expre&s;|&s;es, in its own peculiar manner, its participa|tion in the joys of this moment. The lowing of the herds, the bleating of the &s;heep, the &s;inging of the birds, the hum of the in&s;ects, all fill the great chorus which hails the return of day. But it is a &s;cene only to be felt, not de&s;cribed. No poet, no painter, can do it ju&s;tice; it is too great, too &s;ublime, to come within the limits of their powers. Whoever really feels and enjoys it, will own with me, that at no other time he ever finds his mind elevated towards the Sovereign of the Uni|ver&s;e with &s;uch a fervor of devotion. The heart overflows with an exce&s;s of feeling; one &s;tretches out one's arms, and longs to embrace the utmo&s;t bounds of creation; the gra&s;p is too mighty, and the full &s;oul &s;eeks a
<PB N="143" REF="038544_0142_1012546D891220D8">
kindred mind to &s;hare the&s;e overpowering emotions.</P>
<P>As Clara &s;at, in one of the fine&s;t mornings of the &s;pring, under the &s;hade of a &s;tately old oak, with all the&s;e &s;en&s;ations newly awakened in her bo&s;om, &s;he was &s;een by the young Baron von Tiefenthal, who lived in a town not far di&s;tant. He had been &s;ent thither by his father for the purpo&s;e of pur|&s;uing his &s;tudies; but in&s;tead of fulfilling this, devoted him&s;elf to all kinds of di&s;&s;ipati|on. He was hunting in this romantic coun|try, as he now &s;aw, unnoticed by her, the beautiful Clara. The power of her charms had an in&s;tantaneous effect on him. In the cour&s;e of his licentious amours, he had never &s;een the bloom of &s;uch a cheek, the expre&s;|&s;ion of &s;uch an eye, and &s;till le&s;s any thing like the innocent plea&s;ure which was paint|ed on her lovely face, evidently ari&s;ing from her enjoyment of the beauties of nature, as &s;he contemplated the &s;urrounding country.</P>
<P>Tiefenthal, who&s;e intemperate pa&s;&s;ions were already highly excited, re&s;pectfully ap|proaching the fair creature. "I am fortu|nate," he &s;aid, "to find here a congenial &s;oul, which can feel what I feel, and will there|fore pardon my breaking in on the&s;e feelings which my heart is full of, and &s;o ardently
<PB N="144" REF="038544_0143_10125470004686B0">
wi&s;hes to &s;hare with one of &s;imilar &s;enti|ments."&mdash;Clara &s;tarted up, alarmed, and would have flown, if her heart had not felt this &s;imilarity too powerfully; or if the youth who &s;tood before her, had not been &s;o hand|&s;ome, and had not &s;upplicated &s;o urgently for her longer &s;tay. One word brought on another. The di&s;&s;embler knew &s;o well how to play his part; talked &s;o much of the beau|ties of nature, of the plea&s;ures they held out to the admirers of them, that the un&s;u&s;pect|ing female &s;oon found his company agree|able, and was not di&s;plea&s;ed when he pro|mi&s;ed to come there again the next morning, and &s;hare with her this rational delight.</P>
<P>I &s;hould deviate from my purpo&s;e, and extend my hi&s;tory to many volumes, if I &s;hould continue to relate thus circum&s;tanti|ally the whole account of the &s;eduction of the artle&s;s Clara. I will therefore be as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. She &s;aw the beautiful youth again the next and many following days. She found his conver&s;ation extremely agreeable, and giving way to the impul&s;e of nature, &s;he &s;oon loved him with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, without having any idea of his villainy, and her own danger. But before two months were elap&s;ed he had taken ad|vantage of her innocence, and &s;he became his victim.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="038544_0144_1012547199BB91F8">Clara felt her fall very deeply, and in the fir&s;t bitter moments of regret, determined never to &s;ee the youth again. But his per|&s;ua&s;ions, and the pleadings of her own heart, for him, were &s;o powerful, that notwith&s;tand|ing her re&s;olution, &s;he &s;aw him again in the evening, and from that time received his clan|de&s;tine vi&s;its in a remote chamber in the hou&s;e of her fo&s;ter mother. The natural con|&s;equence of this connection en&s;ued; and as &s;oon as Clara was &s;en&s;ible of it, &s;he claimed from her lover the fulfilment of his &s;olemn engagements, and entreated him with angui&s;h to conceal her &s;hame, and marry her as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Tiefenthal renewed his promi&s;es, and then left her, in order, as he &s;aid, to mention the &s;ubject to his father, and to obtain his con&s;ent to their marriage. But this was only a pre|tence to deceive her, for he returned immedi|ately to the town; and while the anxious Clara was praying for the &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of his errand, and his &s;peedy return, he had for|gotten her in the arms of pro&s;titution. One evening when he was drunk, a quarrel aro&s;e between him and one of his companions, from whom he would forcibly have taken a favourite girl, and he was &s;tabbed by him in the &s;cuffle, and died without having repented &mdash;without having even confe&s;&s;ed the crimes
<PB N="146" REF="038544_0145_101254740FF5B180">
that he had committed here below. His fa|ther was informed of his mi&s;erable end, and as he very naturally endeavoured to draw a veil over it, his being dead was but little known, and the manner of his death &s;till le&s;s.</P>
<P>While the corp&s;e of Tiefenthal was moul|dering in the grave&punc; and his &s;oul gone to its dreadful account, Clara was impatiently ex|pecting his return. Every day increa&s;ed her &s;orrow, and al&s;o made her &s;ituation more con&s;picuous, till at la&s;t &s;he was no longer able to conceal this, and much le&s;s her tears from the watchful eye of her fo&s;ter-mother. She owned to her the rea&s;on of her &s;orrow; and the dreadful intelligence had &s;uch an ef|fect on her, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it threw her into a deadly &s;ickne&s;s. Before &s;he died &s;he wrote to Cap|tain Wildner, informing him of Clara's un|happy &s;ituation, and or the probability of her own death.</P>
<P>On the very day in which the wretched Clara had buried her invaluable, and now for ever lo&s;t friend, her father and brother returned, and entered her room in a violent agitation. She fainted away at the &s;ight of them, and was only recovered, after &s;ome time, by the affectionate care&s;&s;es of her fa|ther. He &s;oothed her angui&s;h, and promi&s;ed
<PB N="147" REF="038544_0146_101254775B6590A8">
never to think har&s;hly of her; and al&s;o to pardon her &s;educer if he would repair the in|jury that he had been guilty of, and reward her too tender love by making her his wife. As &s;he &s;till believed that her lover was &s;in|cere, and now with his father, the Captain did not go to the town, where, by minute en|quiries, he would probably have learnt his dreadful end; but he &s;et out with her direct|ly for the village in which was the Baron von Tiefenthal's ca&s;tle. His intention was, fir&s;t to &s;peak with the young man, and if he found him faithful, then to talk with the old Baron on the ju&s;tice due to his daughter; but if he found young Tiefenthal a villain, unmindful of his engagements, he then re&s;olved to take fearful vengeance on the traitor.</P>
<P>Before &s;he could reach the village, poor Clara, overcome by fatigue and anxiety, fell dangerou&s;ly ill. In con&s;equence of this they &s;topped at a cottage, the owners of which re|ceived them with kindne&s;s, and entertained them in the be&s;t manner they were able. After two days of &s;evere &s;uffering, Clara, ra|ther before her time, was delivered of a boy. Both mother and child were almo&s;t dead; and unfortunately in this part of the country there was no medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be obtain|ed. The poor di&s;con&s;olate old father often <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for hours by her bed&s;ide in &s;ilence and
<PB N="148" REF="038544_0147_10125479D1F198F0">
de&s;pair; but when now and then Clara ap|peared to revive, and cla&s;ped her crying in|fant to her brea&s;t, he was comforted again, and hoped that all might yet be well.</P>
<P>In conver&s;ation with his kind ho&s;t, he learned that the old Baron von Tiefenthal's Ca&s;tle was only about nine miles from thence; that his &s;on was a profligate youth, the ter|ror of all parents who had hand&s;ome daugh|ters, and of all hu&s;bands who had hand&s;ome wives; and that he was now the declared lover of the beautiful Counte&s;s von M&mdash;. Whe|ther he was at pre&s;ent with his father, or ro|ving about el&s;ewhere, the old pea&s;ant, who &s;el|dom left his &s;olitude, could not tell.</P>
<P>This heart-rending di&s;cription of the &s;edu|cer of his child induced the Captain to &s;end his &s;on to the village, which lay near the ca&s;tle, to learn &s;ome farther particulars re|&s;pecting young Tiefenthal, and whether he was now in the country. He went the &s;ame day on which the old Baron brought poor Wolfgang with him to his hou&s;e. Many of the inhabitants of the village, who in pa&s;&s;ing, took him for his &s;on, warned their daughters of him in the pre&s;ence of young Wildner; and when he made farther enquiries about him, he heard the &s;ame account that had already been given to his father. "We &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="149" REF="038544_0148_1012547B6D8AD428">
him," they added, "dead; but weeds do not die, and now we mu&s;t take care, or we &s;hall live to &s;ee new di&s;tre&s;&s;es brought among&s;t us by his debaucheries."</P>
<P>When the &s;on returned with this lamenta|ble account to his father, both, glowing with indignation, vowed to revenge them&s;elves on the traitor, if he would not render full and complete &s;atisfaction to the injured Clara. Young Wildner went out again, and &s;wore to his father not to return till he brought the be|trayer with him.</P>
<P>He met the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;'s coach as &s;he was carrying Wolfgang to her ca&s;tle; and being informed by a pea&s;ant that it was her, and that her companion was no doubt the young Baron von Tiefenthal, he followed the carriage with ha&s;ty &s;teps, and overtook them walking in the grove. His impatience for revenge did not permit him to a&s;k for any explanation; he only peremptorily com|manded Wolfgang to follow him, who inno|cently complied with this demand.</P>
<P>The &s;equel of this melancholy &s;tory is al|ready known to my readers, and it would therefore be &s;uperfluous to relate it again.</P>

<P>ON the evening of the &s;ame day, in which poor Wolfgang was &s;o barbarou&s;ly murdered, the innocent Emily, &s;eated under the &s;hade of a lime, wept &s;incerely this unexpected misfortune. He was, in their &s;hort acquaint|ance, become very dear to her, and was al|ways pre&s;ent to her imagination, as he had knelt before her, when they &s;ilently, but ex|pre&s;&s;ively pledged to each other mutual fide|lity. To have lo&s;t him in a moment after, and that without a hope of ever &s;eeing him again, were circum&s;tances of &s;uch bewilder|ing horror, that all attempts to reconcile her&s;elf to them were vain. Not far from her &s;at her fo&s;ter-mother and the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, with di&s;appointment &s;trongly depict|ed on their countenances, in earne&s;t conver|&s;ation. All their plans and hopes were de|feated by Wolfgang's death, and the thought|le&s;s Counte&s;s felt, for the fir&s;t time, a real anxiety how to di&s;engage her&s;elf from her debts, and leave an unencumbered e&s;tate to her daughter. They had ju&s;t come to a re&s;o|lution
<PB N="151" REF="038544_0150_1012548135BDC448">
to have the dead body drawn out of the &s;haft early the next morning, and to ap|propriate to them&s;elves whatever they might find in the pockets of the decea&s;ed, as a law|ful inheritance, as a young pea&s;ant ran by them in the utmo&s;t ha&s;te; angui&s;h and fear were painted on his brow, and his terrible groans made them notice and &s;top him.

"I was ga|thering berries in the wood near the &s;haft&mdash;there is &s;omething alive in it&mdash;it moaned&mdash;I ran away! and now I always think it is com|ing after me!"</P>

<P>"That is my poor Savoyard!" cries Emily, &s;tarting up; "Oh if he yet lives, how happy I &s;hall be!" "Yes, indeed, how happy we &s;hall be!" cry the Counte&s;s and the old wo|man.&mdash;"I will go to him! I mu&s;t &s;ee him and comfort him!" cries Emily, and &s;he was going forwards. The prudent old woman detained her, and convinced her that to com|fort him was impo&s;&s;ible, till they had obtain|ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance to draw him from the &s;haft.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the neighbouring vil|lage were &s;ummoned; and, furni&s;hed with co<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s, poles, and ladders, &s;et out to accom|pli&s;h
<PB N="152" REF="038544_0151_10125483A64B6BC8">
this purpo&s;e. On the way it fir&s;t occur|red to the Counte&s;s, that perhaps the depth of the &s;haft might baffle all their endeavours; but an old pea&s;ant, who walked next to her, a&s;&s;ured her to the contrary, for that one of his calves had fallen in there the year before, and that he had ventured down to re&s;cue it, and did not find the hole above forty feet deep, and the bottom of it was overgrown with &s;oft mo&s;s. He offered to go down now with a rope, and bind the unfortunate per&s;on who had been thrown in there, when tho&s;e on the out&s;ide could draw him up, and after|wards him&s;elf. This comfortable account drew them all on with increa&s;ing ha&s;te, and they came to the mouth of the &s;haft in a very &s;hort time. Emily was the fir&s;t there, and bending over the edge, &s;he called to her dear Savoyard, and was an&s;wered by a deep moan.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ant went down, and &s;oon called out, "Draw him up, I have fa&s;tened him well. He is &s;till alive, and &s;peaks, but it is in a language that I do not under&s;tand." Every one took hold of the ropes, and drew with united &s;trength; Emily her&s;elf was among&s;t them, and was anxiou&s;ly careful that her Wolfgang might not be wounded anew in this operation. At la&s;t the load came near, and with one effort more it lay before them, when they all became &s;peechle&s;s with
<PB N="153" REF="038544_0152_101254854569A690">
a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing, not the hoped-for Sa|voyard, but a hand&s;omely dre&s;&s;ed woman. She moaned lamentably, and kept her right hand upon her heart. Her clothes were bloody, and when they examined her, they found a dagger plunged, up to the hilt, in her left brea&s;t. As &s;he endeavoured, in vain, to draw this out, a good-natured pea&s;ant rendered her this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and a &s;tream of blood flowed after it. The unfortunate wo|man once opened her large blue eyes, and then expired in the arms of the Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>Emily very earne&s;tly entreated the pea&s;ant in the &s;haft, to &s;earch if there was not &s;till another body to be found. But he a&s;&s;ured her, on his honour, there were no more.</P>
<P>Deceived in their hopes, the whole com|pany wandered back in a melancholy di&s;po|&s;ition, fully convinced by this double proof, that there mu&s;t be robbers and murderers harboured in the wood. The Counte&s;s re|&s;olved, therefore, to have it &s;earched tho|roughly the next day, and, in the meanwhile, for the greater &s;ecurity of her darling, to take her, and her fo&s;ter-mother, with her to the ca&s;tle. The corp&s;e of the &s;tranger was al&s;o brought there, and they examined her clothes and her pockets, but found not the lea&s;t clue to lead them even to gue&s;s who &s;he
<PB N="154" REF="038544_0153_10125487BB6E6E88">
might be; they only di&s;covered that this poor murdered woman was very big with child. This dreadful &s;ight excited new compa&s;&s;ion in the heart of the Counte&s;s; &s;he wept very &s;incerely for her, and the next day had her buried in her family vault.</P>
<P>Early the en&s;uing morning, the pea&s;ants from the village a&s;&s;embled again, and went, with the &s;ervants of the Counte&s;s, to &s;earch the wood; and if they did not take the mur|derers, at lea&s;t to alarm them by this atten|tion, and probably remove them from thence. They returned, in the evening, without &s;uc|ce&s;s; for, notwith&s;tanding their extreme dili|gence, they had neither found any traces of Wolfgang, nor of the murderers. After this, Emily returned to the cottage with the old woman, and the Counte&s;s re&s;olved to go and re&s;ide, for &s;ome time, in the neighbouring town, partly to bani&s;h care, and partly to execute a plan which &s;he had formed, for the payment of her mo&s;t urgent debts.</P>
<P>The day before that fixed on for her de|parture, a &s;tranger arrived at the ca&s;tle, and enquired of the &s;ervants if the Counte&s;s von M&mdash; lived there. On being an&s;wered in the affirmative, he de&s;ired to &s;ee her, and, when he was conducted to her, he pre&s;ented her with a ca&s;ket carefully &s;ealed up, and
<PB N="155" REF="038544_0154_1012548B09E52460">
begged for a certificate that he had delivered it faithfully. The Counte&s;s opened the ca&s;ket directly, and found, to her great a&s;toni&s;hment, that it contained four thou&s;and &s;equins, and a quantity of jewels which were apparently of great value. She examined it with the greate&s;t care, but found neither let|ter nor any thing el&s;e, by which &s;he could at all imagine from whom this magnificent pre|&s;ent came, or whether it was properly allot|ted to her. But the addre&s;s, to which &s;he again referred, appeared to prove this clear|ly. She enquired in vain of the bearer for farther &s;atisfaction, for he was unable to gra|tify her curio&s;ity.&mdash;"I am," he &s;aid, "a No|tary and Magi&s;trate of the little town of W&mdash;, which lies four miles from hence. Ye&s;ter|day afternoon a carriage arrived there, and &s;topped at the Golden Sun, and a gentleman who had been dangerou&s;ly wounded, was lifted out of it by his &s;ervants. He de&s;ired that a &s;urgeon might be &s;ent for directly; but as the only one who lives in our town, was gone into the country, this reque&s;t was of no avail. He then begged to have a notary &s;ent for, and I was &s;ummoned to him immediate|ly. He &s;poke to me at fir&s;t in Italian, but as I did not under&s;tand him, he &s;poke to me in German. His fir&s;t enquiries were about the next town, and whether he &s;hould meet with a &s;kilful &s;urgeon there. When I had
<PB N="156" REF="038544_0155_1012548D81028B80">
given him information on the&s;e particulars, he a&s;ked if I knew where your Excellency lived. On my a&s;&s;uring him that I did, he or|dered his valet to reach him this ca&s;ket. With much difficulty he wrote a very &s;hort note, and laid it in the ca&s;ket, which he then &s;eal|ed up him&s;elf, and dictated the direction that is upon it to his valet. At la&s;t he delivered it to me with the mo&s;t urgent reque&s;t to bring it over my&s;elf to your Excellency without de|lay. This I faithfully promi&s;ed; and he then gave me, as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, a pur&s;e of fifty ducats for my trouble, and ordered his &s;ervants to carry him again to his carriage. Before I could &s;et out, he drove pa&s;t my hou&s;e; and what &s;urpri&s;ed me very much, went a quite contrary way than the directi|on which I had given him to the capital."</P>

<P>Before the Notary took leave of the Coun|te&s;s, &s;he made him a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent, and
<PB N="159" REF="038544_0158_1012549503375570">
earne&s;tly entreated him to enquire which way the Marquis was gone; and if he learnt where he was, to let her know directly. The Notary promi&s;ed to do this, and the better to keep his word, left the ca&s;tle immediately.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s examined the pre&s;ent to Emily once again, and found that it was more than &s;ufficient for the payment of her mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing debts; but as it belonged en|tirely to her darling, &s;he was too con&s;cien|tious not to &s;how it to her, and a&s;k her con|&s;ent fir&s;t, before &s;he appropriated it to this purpo&s;e. She &s;ent for her; and fir&s;t relating the incident which had ju&s;t occurred, then mentioned her wi&s;h to apply this trea&s;ure to the liquidation of her debts, to which &s;he a&s;|&s;ented without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>Emily, who was as firmly convinced as the Counte&s;s that no other than her dear Savoyard could have &s;ent her this magnifi|cent pre&s;ent, wept and lamented him &s;incere|ly. "He became dear to me," &s;he &s;aid, "in the few moments of our acquaintance, and will eternally continue &s;o from this dying proof of his love for me. Oh! could I but &s;ave him, could I but nur&s;e and comfort him! I would willingly pa&s;s my life with him, even if it was to be in poverty." The Counte&s;s en|deavoured to con&s;ole her, and attained her
<PB N="160" REF="038544_0159_10125497722AE928">
end completely, as &s;he clearly proved to her, that a man, endowed with &s;uch &s;upernatural &s;trength, would certainly al&s;o have the means to heal his wounds. "If he could," &s;he ad|ded, "re&s;cue him&s;elf out of the &s;haft with|out any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if he could, in &s;o &s;hort a time, provide him&s;elf with a carriage, hor&s;es, and &s;ervants, he, no doubt, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of re&s;toring him&s;elf to health, by his &s;uperior knowledge probably in the u&s;e of &s;imples. In the meanwhile only wa&s;t pa|tiently; he will &s;ooner or later return quite recovered, and make you the happie&s;t of women." Emily promi&s;ed to be ea&s;y, and looked anxiou&s;ly towards the day in which &s;he &s;hould again &s;ee the beloved of her heart.</P>
<P>Before two days were pa&s;&s;ed, the Coun|te&s;s had &s;old the jewels; and being now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ixty thou&s;and florins, on the third day &s;he &s;atisfied the greater part of her cre|ditors. As &s;he &s;at down to table in the even|ing, in company with her Emily, much ea|&s;ier in her mind on being relieved from the&s;e incumbrances, a me&s;&s;enger on hor&s;eback ar|rived at the ca&s;tle. He brought her a letter from the Notary, in which he informed her, that he had been fortunate enough to di&s;co|ver the route which the Marquis had taken, and followed him to the next Saxon frontier town, where, to his great grief, he found
<PB N="161" REF="038544_0160_101254991133E670">
him in his coffin, and &s;aw him buried the &s;ame day. That to the &s;urpri&s;e of every bo|dy, his &s;ervants had vani&s;hed immediately af|ter his death, and left no traces of which way they were flown. That the magi&s;trate of the town had been called in to take charge of whatever he might have left; but that, ex|cepting &s;ome few clothes, and a little linen, there was not any thing found. It was there|fore a well grounded pre&s;umption, that his &s;ervants had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of whatever papers and money he might have had with him, as &s;oon as their ma&s;ter was dead, and had di&s;appeared on that account.</P>

<P>EMILY, on this fre&s;h di&s;appointment of her fonde&s;t hopes, felt all her &s;orrow renew|ed with the greater keenne&s;s. She mourned in Wolfgang, a lover and benefactor, who had, in her opinion, undeniably proved in the latter his &s;incerity in the former character. Gratitude and love thus, combined to fill her &s;oul with a lively grief, that &s;he did not at|tempt
<PB N="162" REF="038544_0161_1012549B89AE87E8">
to di&s;&s;emble. In vain her noble mo|ther &s;ought to con&s;ole her; &s;he rejected all con&s;olation, and withdrew, unperceived from the company, in order to be able to weep without interruption.</P>
<P>The evening was delightful; the full moon, with her melancholy light, illuminated the whole region, and invited Emily to wander down the avenue of the Ca&s;tle, at the end of which &s;he &s;tood &s;till, ab&s;orbed in her di&s;tre&s;&s;|ful feelings. In this &s;ituation, without having heard any previous noi&s;e, &s;he felt her&s;elf all at once &s;eized by &s;omebody with very &s;trong arms, who held her from behind, while ano|ther &s;topped her mouth, and covered her head; and then lifting her up, they carried her off with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te. After run|ning for &s;ome minutes, they put her into a carriage, but &s;till covered up, and drove off directly; and now as the rattling of the wheels would prevent her cries being heard, they took the bandage from her mouth.</P>
<P>She wept and complained in vain, for they appeared not to mind her, as &s;he received no an&s;wer, though &s;he perceived plainly that &s;omebody &s;at on each &s;ide of her. When they had driven for about an hour, the carriage &s;topped. Emily was lifted out, and not|with&s;tanding her earne&s;t remon&s;trances, they
<PB N="163" REF="038544_0162_1012549DF94CEA30">
undre&s;&s;ed her to her &s;hift. In her efforts to re&s;i&s;t them &s;he pulled off the cloth that co|vered her head, and &s;aw to her great amaze|ment, that &s;he was in a wood; that it was two men who were undre&s;&s;ing her, and that two others &s;tood by with lighted torches. Believing her&s;elf to be, without doubt, in the hands of tho&s;e villains who had murdered her poor Wolfgang before her eyes, &s;he fully expected to &s;hare the &s;ame fate; and, over|come with apprehen&s;ion, &s;unk into a &s;woon, out of which the was fir&s;t rou&s;ed by the &s;hak|ing of the carriage. To her great a&s;toni&s;h|ment &s;he found her&s;elf quite dre&s;&s;ed again; and this a&s;toni&s;hment was increa&s;ed, as &s;he perceived that &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed as a man. The day now began to dawn, and &s;he looked with &s;urpri&s;e alternately at her&s;elf, at the fine car|riage, and at her conductors; an old gentleman &s;at on her left hand, and oppo&s;ite to her two dome&s;tics, who carefully ob&s;erved all her mo|tions; the former held a &s;melling bottle in his hand, and addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Emily in a lan|guage of which &s;he under&s;tood not a word. Quite confounded by all the inexplicable cir|cum&s;tances of her &s;ituation, &s;he remained for &s;ome time &s;ilent; but as &s;he began to recover from this, and to feel with renewed force her cruel &s;eparation from her mother, &s;he was entirely overcome, and, beginning to weep bitterly, fell at the feet of the old man.&mdash;
<PB N="164" REF="038544_0163_101254A148FE0850">
"Whoever thou art," &s;he &s;aid, "let me hope for compa&s;&s;ion from thy age, and they vene|rable countenance! What have I done that I am treated in this manner? Whither do&s;t thou carry me? Oh, take me again to my di&s;con&s;olate mother, or at lea&s;t leave me at liberty!"</P>
<P>The old gentleman &s;miled rather con|temptuou&s;ly, and made a long &s;erious ha|rangue in the &s;ame, to her unintelligible lan|guage, as he &s;poke before; and notwith&s;tand|ing her repeatedly a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he did not under&s;tand him, he went on with yet more &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and at la&s;t pulled out a dag|ger and a pi&s;tol, which he held to her brea&s;t with terrible threats; and Emily, trembling and weeping, &s;hrunk from him into the cor|ner of the carriage.</P>
<P>A repetition of &s;uch &s;cenes frequently took place between this poor captive and the old gentleman, who &s;he ob&s;erved was treated by the others with great reverence. They tra|velled very fa&s;t, only &s;topping occa&s;ionally for very &s;hort intervals; and previou&s;ly to the&s;e, bandages were always put over Emily's eyes and mouth, and &s;he was made to &s;it up|on the floor of the coach, and obliged often to remain &s;ome hours in this &s;ituation. She &s;oon took notice that it was only in uninha|bited

places that they allowed her the privi|leges of &s;ight and &s;peech, or ever permitted her to get out of the carriage, at which times the old gentleman always kept watch over her at a little di&s;tance, and never cea&s;ed to threaten her terribly. All kinds of refre&s;h|ments were offered to her, but &s;he &s;tubborn|ly refu&s;ed them, till the old man con&s;trained her to eat by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> pi&s;tol.</P>
<P>Emily, who had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> before been &s;epa|rated for a day from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ter mother, was dreadfully hara&s;&s;ed by a behaviour to which &s;he was &s;o entirely unaccu&s;tomed, and by a thou&s;and painful apprehen&s;ions as to the fate to which &s;he might be de&s;tined. She was un|able to &s;leep, and, but for her youth and vi|gorous con&s;titution, mu&s;t have &s;unk under the fatigue and di&s;tre&s;s which &s;he &s;uffered. The idea of making her e&s;cape was con&s;tant|ly pre&s;ent to her, and particularly during the night, when her conductors were over|powered with &s;leep; but &s;he &s;oon perceived that this would be impracticable, as two &s;er|vants, who &s;at upon the box all day, always rode by the &s;ide of the carriage at night, and waked the guards within whenever they came to a place where they were to take fre&s;h hor&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="038544_0165_101254A5586D3068">Four days and five nights they went on in this manner, and poor Emily was become extremely weak, when at the dawn of the fifth day they &s;topped at a hou&s;e, without her conductors having as u&s;ual put the bandages upon her eyes and mouth. To her great a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;atisfaction the door of the carriage was opened, and &s;he was urged to get out, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hewn into a room. But her joy was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> when &s;he heard that all the inhabi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> of the hou&s;e &s;poke the &s;ame language, with which &s;he was daily tormented by her conductors; and &s;he was now convinced that &s;he was in a country where this was the native language. They brought her &s;ome coffee, which &s;he &s;wallow|ed with great eagerne&s;s, not having had any thing of the kind during her journey; and the old gentleman took more pains to entertain her than ever. On Emily's again a&s;&s;uring him that &s;he did not under&s;tand one word of what he &s;aid, he ended the conver&s;ation with reproaches; and &s;he plainly &s;aw that he made complaints of her behaviour to the owner of the hou&s;e, and &s;hewed him a letter which greatly excited his &s;urpri&s;e; but &s;he was already &s;o much u&s;ed to riddles, that this appeared indifferent to her, and, mu&s;ing with|in her&s;elf, &s;he did not pay them any farther attention.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="038544_0166_101254A8B4F868D8">They &s;oon &s;et out again on their journey, and travelled now more lei&s;urely, putting up regularly at the inns, where &s;he was liberally provided with every thing, and a particular table was always prepared for her. In the evening, as the old gentleman conducted her to a &s;eparate bed chamber, he gave her a parcel of women's apparel, at &s;ight of which &s;he once more felt real plea&s;ure. Out of gra|titude &s;he ki&s;&s;ed the hand of the old man, who endeavoured to prevent her &s;hewing him this re&s;pect; and ki&s;&s;ing her's in return, he then withdrew, and left her to examine the clothes, which &s;he found much hand&s;omer than tho&s;e &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to wear.</P>
<P>One of Emily's great concerns had been, the being obliged to be dre&s;&s;ed like a man; and her awkward comical manner in this dre&s;s had often excited the &s;miles of her con|ductors, and as often made her blu&s;h. A long mantle, which they had given her, was her only con&s;olation, and &s;he was never content|ed but when &s;he could cover her&s;elf in it en|tirely. Every female, who imagines her&s;elf for a moment in Emily's &s;ituation, will not probably be &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;he put on this long wi&s;hed-for dre&s;s directly, and throwing her&s;elf upon the bed, &s;lept &s;oftly after her ex|ce&s;&s;ive fatigue.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="038544_0167_101254AB28D1EF98">On the evening of the tenth day, after this metamorpho&s;is, they travelled later than u&s;ual. The old gentleman was this day more than commonly eloquent; his manner was urgent, and often affecting, and Emily could under&s;tand plainly that he was very &s;olicitous for an an&s;wer from her. But however wil|lingly &s;he would have gratified him, it was not in her power; &s;he could only reply to him by tears and ge&s;tures, and was obliged to bear patiently his thru&s;ting her from him, and the renewal of all his former threats. About midnight he became quiet, and the carriage &s;oon &s;topped at a large building, which &s;tood in a wild country, &s;urrounded with wood.</P>
<P>Emily, who had hitherto been always pro|jecting plans for her e&s;cape, which &s;he &s;till hoped to accompli&s;h, was in terrible con&s;ter|nation when &s;he &s;aw this building, on account of its being &s;o entirely different from all tho&s;e to which &s;he had been habituated. An in|ward foreboding pointed it out to her as the boundary of her journey; and though &s;he hoped indeed now for &s;ome explanation of this enigmatical affair, &s;he al&s;o feared to ex|perience new misfortunes. After knocking a long time, and ringing a great bell, &s;ome|body came to one of the windows; and after making many enquiries of tho&s;e waiting with|out,
<PB N="169" REF="038544_0168_101254ACC74501F8">
the door was at la&s;t opened. Two wo|men, who&s;e &s;trange dre&s;s excited Emily's ad|miration, came out with lamps in their hands, and received her as &s;he was li&s;ted out of the carriage; and likewi&s;e a letter, which was delivered to them by the old gentleman. The door was &s;hut again directly, and Emily's a&s;toni&s;hment was extreme, to find her&s;elf left by all her hitherto conductors, and only in the company of the two women.</P>
<P>They carried her through a long pa&s;&s;age, &s;paringly lighted by one lamp, till they came to a little room which they forced her to en|ter. They talked to her for &s;ome time, but &s;he did not under&s;tand them, and they were as much at a lo&s;s when &s;he an&s;wered them in German. At length they left her alone, and her di&s;tre&s;s and fear were much increa&s;ed when &s;he began to examine her room nar|rowly. In one corner of it there was a &s;traw bed, upon which lay an indifferent woollen cover; next to this &s;tood a little altar, and upon it there were a crucifix and &s;ome other images: a &s;mall wooden table and a &s;tool completed the inventory of the furniture of this place. My readers will immediately un|der&s;tand that Emily was in the cell of a con|vent; but this &s;he could not gue&s;s, as &s;he was educated in the Prote&s;tant religion, and from her youth had lived in a &s;olitude, where
<PB N="170" REF="038544_0169_101254AF5CFDBCD8">
&s;he never even &s;aw any Catholic clergy, or could acquire any idea of a cloi&s;ter. It was not at that time the cu&s;tom of writers to make romantic hi&s;tories of Monks and Nuns, and con&s;equently &s;he could not, through &s;uch me|diums, become acquainted with the cu&s;tom and appearance of convents. It is ea&s;y to pardon her, therefore, if &s;he feared and be|lieved, from this indifferent furniture, that &s;he was in a pri&s;on, and gave her&s;elf up to &s;orrow. She ran to the window, to breathe the free air, and tranquillize her beating heart; but the clo&s;e grate which &s;urrounded it frightened her back, and contributed to confirm her the more in her terrible conjec|ture.</P>
<P>It was pa&s;t midnight, and &s;he was extreme|ly tired with her long journey, but yet &s;ound no inclination to &s;leep. She &s;tarted indeed with horror from the bed, upon which, ac|cording to the &s;ugge&s;tions of her ardent ima|gination, many innocent victims had lain convul&s;ed with agony. As &s;he was dwelling on this idea, &s;he all on a &s;udden heard the &s;ound of a dull bell, and &s;oon after a noi&s;e in the whole building, &s;ucceeded by a murmur of praying mournfully. This &s;he immediate|ly concluded to be the carrying &s;ome poor &s;inner to the place of execution, having often heard from her fo&s;ter-mother accounts of this
<PB N="171" REF="038544_0170_101254B2A39E4558">
kind; and, &s;uppo&s;ing her&s;elf to be now in danger of a &s;imilar fate, &s;he &s;unk to the ground in a &s;woon.</P>
<P>Early in the morning the Nuns found her in a lamentable &s;ituation; the fatigue and terror that &s;he had undergone had brought on a violent fever, attended with delirium; &s;he raved dreadfully, and fancied every Nun who came near her was one of the &s;ervants of the executioner. The&s;e feeble creatures could with difficulty get her into bed, and they were obliged to gird her down in order to keep her there.</P>
<P>In this manner lay the poor lo&s;t Emily, &s;lowly langui&s;hing out her exi&s;tence; for all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the Nuns attempted to admini&s;ter to her, and that of the &s;piritual and bodily phy&s;icians, who were called in to her directly, was of no avail, for the fever continued to rage unabatedly, and the deli|rium increa&s;ed. On the twentieth day of her &s;uffering &s;he received general ab&s;olution, and the extreme unction, without being at all &s;en&s;ible of what they were doing to her; and on the evening of the &s;ame day, the Nuns an|nounced to the Abbe&s;s that the &s;ick &s;tranger was even then expiring.</P>

<P>THE &s;lumbering powers of ju&s;tice having been once more awakened in Italy again&s;t the daring banditti, the former colleagues of Jacob, they continued, after his departure, to experience &s;o vigorous a pro&s;ecution, that, no longer finding any pro&s;pect of &s;afety in their native land, the majority of them re|&s;olved to follow the example of their re|nowned companion, and retire till the &s;torm was laid; and in the meantime determined to pay him a vi&s;it in Germany. "We may po&s;|&s;ibly," &s;aid they among them&s;elves, "find &s;omething to do there; the cold-blooded Germans will perhaps &s;uffer us quietly to gain a livelihood on their highways till we can return hither without danger."</P>
<P>Jacob was very much &s;urpri&s;ed one day at meeting two of his mo&s;t intimate comrades in one of the &s;treets of the capital, and to learn from them that there were twenty others be|&s;ides them&s;elves likewi&s;e in the neighbour|hood.
<PB N="173" REF="038544_0172_101254B6B1C1CEE8">
Their joy at this unexpected rencon|tre was much greater than his, becau&s;e he had at that time firmly re&s;olved never to en|gage in robbery and murder again, but to en|joy his lately acquired fortune in quiet. But in this company he was &s;oon induced to give up his re&s;olution, and to unite in their &s;cheme of highway robbery. He carried them into a wood through which the road to Saxony lay; and before the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t day, after they were lodged there, this ban|ditti, eager for prey, had robbed three car|riages, and murdered as many men. The&s;e unu&s;ual accounts frightened the whole coun|try; every one talked of the&s;e murders, and every one armed them&s;elves again&s;t the mur|derers.</P>
<P>As one of the banditti Ventured once into a village to buy provi&s;ions, he was, on &s;ome &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, arre&s;ted by the pea&s;ants, as one of the perpetrators of the&s;e recent murders, and carried before the ma|gi&s;trate to be examined. When the re&s;t of the troop heard from their tru&s;ty Jacob, that their comrade would be conveyed in the evening from the village Judge to the office of the inqui&s;ition, they waited in the road for him; and while they believed that they were re&s;cuing their comrade, they &s;et poor Wolfgang at liberty, who was then carried

as a pri&s;oner the &s;ame way. His e&s;cape therefore was no more &s;upernatural than his being taken up for a thief on entering the ale hou&s;e of the village, wrapt in the very mantle which had been &s;tolen from the ho&s;t, or than his being &s;u&s;pected as a murderer, after the de&s;cription given of him by Captain Wildner.</P>
<P>Wolfgang was at that time unknown to him&s;elf, carried to the ca&s;tle of the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, becau&s;e the village in which they arre&s;ted him lay within her juri&s;diction, and there, as my readers will recollect, he was confined in a cave for want of a better pri&s;on. In this cave, according to the ac|count of a foreigner, a hunt&s;man who had often &s;ojourned there, a great trea&s;ure was burried. The &s;teward of the Counte&s;s, who had often, as he waited on her at table, heard her talk of the great trea&s;ure which lay concealed in this country, heard about this time from a pea&s;ant what was &s;aid by the hunt&s;man, in con&s;equence of which, he &s;ent for him directly. The hunt&s;man not only maintained the truth of his account, but a&s;&s;ured the &s;teward that this trea&s;ure might ea&s;ily be obtained; and he engaged to &s;earch for it, for him, if he would give him a new coat and wai&s;tcoat, &s;ome linen, twelve
<PB N="175" REF="038544_0174_101254BCB642CAF8">
new dollars, and &s;ix new ducats for the &s;pi|rit who guarded it.</P>
<P>The &s;teward agreed to every thing, and promi&s;ed to bring the pre&s;ent with him to the place; and the cunning hunt&s;man hoped to e&s;cape with it, and elude the expected per|formance of his engagement. The &s;imple &s;teward was in his room, preparing him&s;elf by praying and &s;inging, for this undertaking, when Wolfgang was brought pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle, and without his knowledge confined in the cave. When he came, equipped with his pre&s;ent, and whatever el&s;e was requi&s;ite for their employment, to the door of this place, which was u&s;ually open, and found it barred, the hunt&s;man, who was eager for the prize, a&s;&s;ured him that this was the only night that the trea&s;ure could be rai&s;ed without danger; and advi&s;ed that they &s;hould go down through the air-hole of the cave, which was re&s;olved on, and they enlarged it with their tools for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The hunt&s;man who had often practi&s;ed frauds of this kind, was dre&s;&s;ed as a &s;orcerer, in order to make more impre&s;&s;ion on the fooli&s;h &s;teward. Wolfgang, who&s;e imagina|tion was full of &s;orcerers, really took him for one, and, terrified at the &s;ight of him, uttered a violent ejaculation, which equally terrify|ing
<PB N="176" REF="038544_0175_101254BF27BCB2F0">
them, they made their e&s;cape as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, leaving all their things behind them, and thus pointed out to Wolfgang the means of effecting his e&s;cape, and left him in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their bundle, which he took away with him.</P>
<P>The village ho&s;t, whom Jacob impo&s;ed on with his well invented tale, and who, by his loquacity had occa&s;ioned &s;o much re&s;pect to be paid to, and &s;o many misfortunes to befall poor Wolfgang, met Jacob the morning after this adventure. He told him that the young Marquis was actually arrived, in the charac|ter of a mou&s;e-trap and hatchel dealer, and had &s;taid one night at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Jacob li&s;tened attentively to this account, and learnt, on further enquiry, that, not|with&s;tanding his promi&s;e, his neighbour had not kept his &s;ecret, but had related the hi&s;to|ry that he entru&s;ted him with, to others; and that the Baron von Tiefenthal, and the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, were now eagerly en|deavouring to decoy the &s;uppo&s;ed Marquis to their hou&s;es, that they might create to them&s;elves, by their attention, an ample claim to his remunerations. He promi&s;ed his neighbour, who was jealous of this, to take an opportunity of informing the young
<PB N="177" REF="038544_0176_101254C0C6E31790">
Marquis of the&s;e de&s;igns, and then ha&s;tened forwards.</P>
<P>Sooner or later thought Jacob, as he went along, it will be di&s;covered, that the Mar|quis, who&s;e coming I have foretold, is only a poor mou&s;e-trap and hatchel-dealer, and I &s;hall then be known for a liar, and perhaps draw on my&s;elf a judicial examination. It will be be&s;t, therefore, that I prevent this di&s;covery, by removing the object who would occa&s;ion it out of the way. He con&s;ulted with his comrades on this, and went out, with one of them, to &s;earch for the innocent creature who was to be their &s;acrifice. They went with this view through the wood be|longing the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, and &s;aw, from a little di&s;tance, Wolfgang and Emily come down the hill together. They recog|nized their victim directly, and &s;tealing near, &s;tabbed him twice with a dagger, and left him, as they hoped, dead. They purpo&s;ely &s;pared Emily, that &s;he might &s;pread the news of his death in the country, and likewi&s;e the belief that he was really a per&s;on of emi|nence, becau&s;e he was murdered without be|ing robbed, by two men in ma&s;ks, who called him Marquis.</P>

<P>LOVE acknowledges no rank, no laws; it derides all threats, defies all dangers, and overcomes all the impediments, which like a barrier, oppo&s;e them&s;elves again&s;t it. If any evidence were yet wanting of the truth of a propo&s;ition already &s;o clearly proved, it is &s;till farther confirmed by the hi&s;tory of the young Duche&s;s R&mdash;, which I &s;hall now relate to my readers.</P>
<P>The Duke of R&mdash;, her father, was a man of the fir&s;t rank and fortune in Italy. She was his only child, and the heire&s;s to his great property; in addition to which, &s;he was univer&s;ally allowed to be one of the mo&s;t beautiful women of her time. With the&s;e attractions, it was not &s;urpri&s;ing that a multitude of lovers &s;acrificed to her charms the incen&s;e of flattery and adoration; and that the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed families in Italy courted her alliance. But to his homage &s;he was in&s;en&s;ible; for &s;he had long loved in
<PB N="179" REF="038544_0178_101254C68AD17090">
&s;ecret, with the tendere&s;t affection, a young Marquis, who was indeed extremely hand|&s;ome, but &s;o poor, that for want of any other means of living, he had for &s;ome years &s;erved her father as his ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e. She, who had before &s;eldom rode out, now found her only plea&s;ure in this exerci&s;e, which gave her an opportunity of being in the company of this beloved object; a part of who&s;e &s;er|vice it was, to ride by the &s;ide of any of the family when they went out on hor&s;eback. Often when they went through a &s;olitary wood in this manner, &s;he would purpo&s;ely by a quick gallop, leave the ho&s;t of &s;ervants far behind them; and when they were thus alone, her u&s;ual timidity gave way to an elo|quent, but yet perfectly mode&s;t expre&s;&s;ion in her fine countenance, of the inward &s;enti|ments of her heart.</P>
<P>The happy ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e at la&s;t un|der&s;tood her, and the&s;e young inexperienced children &s;oon gave them&s;elves up entirely to the guidance of their tender pa&s;&s;ion. As they frequently lo&s;t them&s;elves in the thick|e&s;t parts of the woods, and were &s;ome hours before they returned to their followers, the mo&s;t attentive of the&s;e probably conceiv|ed &s;u&s;picions of them, and immediately im|parted their conjectures to the old Duke. Without giving any rea&s;on for it to his daugh|ter,
<PB N="180" REF="038544_0179_101254C900DB9AC0">
he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e di|rectly from his &s;ervice, and hoped, in this manner, to avoid making the affair public, and put an end at once to what he thought a mere romance. But this precaution came too late; a month &s;ooner perhaps the young Duche&s;s might have been able to forget her lover, but now &s;he was reminded of him eve|ry day, every hour, by the con&s;equences of their pa&s;&s;ion, which, together with the an|gui&s;h occa&s;ioned her by this &s;eparation, made the unfortunate Marquis a thou&s;and times more dear to her. She &s;oon found an oppor|tunity of writing to him, and in this letter &s;o|lemnly avowed not to expo&s;e her&s;elf to the dreaded wrath of her parents, but to follow the impul&s;e of her affections, and fly with him into the wide world. Full of anxiety, &s;he made preparations for this flight with the greate&s;t caution and expedition, and when &s;he accompli&s;hed it, took with her all her jewels, and a ca&s;ket of her father's full of gold.</P>
<P>When the old Duke heard of the elope|ment of his only child, he was quite raving, and &s;wore to &s;acrifice all his fortune if he could but &s;ee her again, and take his revenge on her, and the companion of her flight. He &s;ent out &s;couts after them to all countries, &s;upplied them with large &s;ums of money, and made them take an oath not to return with|out
<PB N="181" REF="038544_0180_101254CA9B30E448">
the delinquents. But one after another returned without having attained their object, till the hou&s;e governor of the Duke was the only one &s;till remaining in pur&s;uit of them. His letters were the &s;ole comfort, the forlorn hope of the di&s;tracted father; for this man al|ways wrote word that he was on the track of the fugitives, and expected yet to overtake them.</P>
<P>This au&s;tere, but faithful &s;ervant, had cho|&s;en four men in Italy for his companions, who&s;e capacities for &s;uch a &s;ervice he knew from experience; and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e excellent blood-hounds, he had always di&s;covered the route of the per&s;ecuted lovers, who perceiving that they were followed, con|tinued their flight without intermi&s;&s;ion. They had already wandered through France, and the greater half of Germany, when they ar|rived at Leip&s;ic; and here, as they had not for a long time had any fre&s;h alarm of being pur&s;ued, they re&s;olved to re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame hotel at which the Marquis and the Dutche&s;s put up, lodged the Baron|e&s;s von Z&mdash;, from Dre&s;den. This Lady, attracted by the angelic countenance, and the whole appearance of the Dutche&s;s, &s;ought to become acquainted with her, and &s;he, happy to meet with &s;uch a per&s;on in a foreign
<PB N="182" REF="038544_0181_101254CD1192E6C0">
country, who appeared to take a cordial in|tere&s;t in her fate, encouraged this acquaint|ance, which &s;oon became a &s;incere friend&s;hip. As the Dutche&s;s was one day about to open her whole heart to the Barone&s;s, the Mar|quis came into the room in great embarra&s;&s;|ment, and in a few words made known to her, that her father's old hou&s;e-governor was that moment arrived at Leip&s;ic, and had put up at a neighbouring hotel. "I pa&s;&s;ed by," added the terrified Marquis, "as he &s;tepped out of the carriage, and can hardly doubt but that he mu&s;t have &s;een and known me."</P>
<P>This account overwhelmed the Dutche&s;s with affliction; and as the amiable Barone&s;s enquired into the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s, they revealed their &s;ituation to her, and entreated to have her advice and protection. "I will endeavour," &s;aid the Barone&s;s, quite affected, "to procure you an a&s;ylum. You mu&s;t fly, but fly in &s;uch a manner that your followers &s;hall not be able to di&s;cover you any more. On the populous highways from one great town to another, you will always be tracked, and never enjoy any re&s;t. I have a friend in Bayreuth, who, like you, has felt the power of love; and I will &s;end you to her, where you will be kindly received, and may live &s;e|curely under her protection till this &s;torm is over, and the anger of your parents is &s;often|ed."
<PB N="183" REF="038544_0182_101254D0592D4C18">
They thanked her mo&s;t cordially for this advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;et out the &s;ame night. The Barone&s;s &s;ent her gentleman with them, and gave them a letter to the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;; for this was the friend to who&s;e attention &s;he recommended them.</P>
<P>This old &s;ervant, who knew all the bye-roads, conducted them happily over the frontiers, and they almo&s;t believed them&s;elves out of the reach of danger, as they were now not above five miles from the Counte&s;s's ca&s;|tle, when they were &s;topped in a wood by &s;ix men in ma&s;ks. The&s;e were &s;ome of Ja|cob's comrades, who were lurking here for booty, and hoped to obtain it from the&s;e travellers; but this time their expectations were deceived. The Marquis's &s;ervants were well armed, and re&s;i&s;ting their attack, wound|ed them &s;o &s;everely, that they were glad to &s;eek their &s;afety in flight, though unfortu|nately not till they had wounded the Mar|quis, who&s;e only &s;olicitude had been to pro|tect the Duche&s;s from their a&s;&s;aults.</P>
<P>Being apprehen&s;ive that this might be the party &s;ent after them by the Duke, and that they would return to the pur&s;uit of them, the Marquis entreated the &s;ervants to drive on again with the utmo&s;t &s;peed. The blood was all this time flowing fa&s;t from his wounds,
<PB N="184" REF="038544_0183_101254D2CDE60778">
and when they came to the end of the wood, they ventured to make a pau&s;e, that they might endeavour to &s;top it. But he, more anxious about his beloved Dutche&s;s than for him&s;elf, &s;aid earne&s;tly, "Do not mind me, but a&s;&s;i&s;t her, and &s;ave her if po&s;&s;ible; for I fear much that this alrrm may bring on her premature delivery, and make our farther progre&s;s impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>The Barone&s;s's gentleman was of the &s;ame opinion, and therefore advi&s;ed the hiring a carriage in the next village, "in which," he added, "I will carry the Dutche&s;s to the Counte&s;s's, where &s;he will find &s;afety and con&s;olation in the arms of a friend, while you go on to the neare&s;t town, and put your&s;elf under the care of a &s;urgeon. I will come to you there, and if your wounds do not prevent it; will conduct you unnoticed to the ca&s;tle, and thus fru&s;trate all further pur&s;uit."</P>
<P>The Marquis approved of this plan, and conjured the gentleman to put it into execu|tion without delay, as he found his wounds grow &s;o extremely painful as ab&s;olutely to require a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They were ju&s;t &s;etting off again, as a well dre&s;&s;ed farmer pa&s;&s;ed them in a light carriage. The gentleman called to him, and a&s;ked if he would, for double the u&s;ual pay, carry a lady, who was taken ill
<PB N="185" REF="038544_0184_101254D4662F11F8">
in con&s;equence of a fright, to the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;'s ca&s;tle. The man in&s;tantly agreed to it, and they all rejoiced that &s;o fa|vourable an opportunity had occurred to forward their &s;cheme. The &s;till fainting Dutche&s;s was put into the carriage directly, and the gentleman &s;eated him&s;elf by her; and in their hurry a little medicine che&s;t, in the form of a chatulle, was all that they took with them. The poor Marquis was thus parted from this beloved object without be|ing able to bid her farewell; but the hope of &s;eeing her again &s;oon made him &s;upport this &s;eparation with tolerable fortitude.</P>
<P>It is with &s;orrow that I acquaint my read|ers of the&s;e hopes being di&s;appointed, from the unfortunate circum&s;tance of the Dutche&s;s's falling into the hands of the formidable Ja|cob; for he was the man in who&s;e-carriage &s;he was placed. It was in the morning of this day that he had murdered poor Wolf|gang, and he was now going to vi&s;it his com|rades in the wood, to hear what they had made of their day's work. The pre&s;ent op|portunity of acquiring, in all probability, a con&s;iderable booty, was too enticing for him to let it pa&s;s by unemployed. He purpo&s;ely carried <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> charge the wrong way; and &s;top|ping in a remote part of the park, while the gentleman was bu&s;y in endeavouring to re|vive
<PB N="186" REF="038544_0185_101254D6E0CCE960">
the Duche&s;s, he thru&s;t daggers into the hearts of both of them. His fir&s;t care, after this deed, was to &s;ecure all the property of the decea&s;ed, and then to conceal their bo|dies. He carried the murdered gentleman a con&s;iderable way to a &s;tream of water, which he knew to be of a great depth; but as this fatigued him very much, and the fear of being di&s;covered filled him with anxiety, he threw the body of the Duche&s;s into a neighbouring &s;haft, which he thought deep enough to con|ceal his villainy from all the world. He then ha&s;tened to his companions, to whom he gave an account of this tran&s;action; but be|ing at the &s;ame time alarmed le&s;t the hand of Ju&s;tice &s;hould be rai&s;ed again&s;t them by the friends of the&s;e victims, and that they &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed in their retreat, he warned them of this, and advi&s;ing them to retire for a few days, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him&s;elf in carrying &s;uch of them as were wounded over the frontiers. Thence it came, that the hunt&s;men and pea&s;ants, who &s;earched the wood the next day, found no traces of the robbers.</P>

<P>THE wounded Marquis, not meeting with a &s;urgeon in the next town, and perceiv|ing his debility increa&s;e, di&s;patched the Nota|ry from thence, with all the jewels which he had with him, be&s;ides a large &s;um of money, to the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, with whom he flattered him&s;elf the Dutche&s;s was then ar|rived in &s;afety, and whom he wi&s;hed, in ca&s;e of his death, to &s;ecure from all danger of fu|ture want; and as her name was Emily, from thence aro&s;e the mi&s;take of the Coun|te&s;s, already known to my readers, in &s;uppo&s;|ing this depo&s;it was a pre&s;ent to her daugh|ter. He &s;et out again directly, and took the road to a little Saxon town, where, accord|ing to the account of his ho&s;t, he would find a &s;kilful &s;urgeon: but too much enfeebled by the lo&s;s of blood, he died after the fir&s;t dre&s;|&s;ing of his wounds. He had previou&s;ly di|vided the remainder of his money among&s;t his &s;ervants, and advi&s;ed them to withdraw immediately after his death, that they might
<PB N="188" REF="038544_0187_101254DCF0252A30">
elude the &s;earch of the Duke's emi&s;&s;aries, and thus e&s;cape his vengeance. To one of them he confided a ring of great value, and a let|ter to the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, in which he informed her of his approaching fate, and con|jured her to be a mother to his Emily, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that in her pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances &s;he might not be informed of his death.</P>
<P>This treacherous &s;ervant re&s;olved to make his advantage of this tru&s;t; and fir&s;t de&s;troy|ing the letter, he went to Leip&s;ic in order to &s;ell the ring, and then intended to return to his native country. As he was going through one of the &s;treets of this town, he was met by companions of the Duke's hou&s;e governor, who knowing him directly for an Italian, &s;oon made an acquaintance with him, and heard, over a gla&s;s of wine, the whole hi&s;to|ry of his unfortunate ma&s;ter; and that the young Dutche&s;s, for he could not gue&s;s to the contrary, was with the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, and there expected the arrival of the Marquis.</P>
<P>Rejoiced at this di&s;covery, they carried the traitor directly to the bed of their &s;ick chief, who was &s;o enfeebled by the unu&s;ual fatigue, of their hara&s;&s;ing journey, that he had been confined to it for many days. His illne&s;s had
<PB N="189" REF="038544_0188_101254DE8F45AB00">
rather been a check to their enquiries after the fugitives, and he already feared to have lo&s;t all traces of them, when he was unex|pectedly delighted by this account. He pro|mi&s;ed the betrayer a thou&s;and fequins, if he would, by craft, get the Dutche&s;s into their hand; and he immediately undertook this, and the plan of carrying her off was projected the &s;ame night.</P>
<P>As the hou&s;e-governor had no expectation of being able to travel at pre&s;ent, and wi&s;h|ed not to lo&s;e any time in the execution of this &s;cheme, he confided the pro&s;ecution of it to one of his comrades, who was once Captain to the con&s;table of Mantua, and who knew very well how to conduct an enterprize of this kind. He had three companions with him, who&s;e courage he had already proved on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, but who all, like him&s;elf were unacquainted with the per&s;on of the young Dutche&s;s. The hou&s;e-governor promi&s;ed to follow them as &s;oon as he was well enough; and if he &s;hould not overtake them on the road, he ordered them to carry their pri&s;oner to the Convent della Redemp|tione, to the Abbe&s;s of which he gave them a letter. He al&s;o gave them letters to the Duke, and furni&s;hed them with money in abundance for their journey. One of them went for|ward, in order to be&s;peak <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> at the &s;tage
<PB N="190" REF="038544_0189_101254E103D41E28">
neare&s;t to the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;'s ca&s;tle; and their informer, who knew the road, was to he their coachman. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hou&s;e-governor commanded them to u&s;e the great|e&s;t precaution in all Prote&s;tant countries, becau&s;e he had an idea that the young Dutch|e&s;s, who &s;poke German fluently, would be immediately re&s;cued and protected, if &s;he called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and offered to adopt that belief. He provided them with both men's and woman's clothes for her; and charged them to dre&s;s her as a man till they got into Italy. From the fir&s;t &s;tage, where the betrayer was to receive his reward if they accompli&s;hed their project, he engaged to come back to Leip&s;ic with the hor&s;es, and acquaint the hou&s;e-governor with their &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>They &s;at out on the third day, and arrived in the evening of the fifth, ju&s;t at twilight, at a little di&s;tance from the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;'s ca&s;tle. According to their pre-con|certed plan, the traitor was to go thither, and to &s;ay in &s;ecret to the Dutche&s;s, that the Marquis, who was much better, had di&s;|patched him to warn her of the Counte&s;s, as he had certain proof that &s;he was in un|der&s;tanding with the emi&s;&s;aries of her father, and would &s;hortly deliver her to them. That he therefore conjured her to follow his me&s;|&s;enger
<PB N="191" REF="038544_0190_101254E46FB99720">
privately to the carriage, in which he was waiting not far off, to receive her with open arms. In this trap they all hoped the inexperienced Dutche&s;s would be caught, be|cau&s;e this faithle&s;s &s;ervant was confided in by the Marquis; and, on account of his know|ledge of the German language, had been ve|ry valuable to them.</P>
<P>He &s;tole down the ca&s;tle avenue with this view, as Emily was walking there bewail|ing her Wolfgang. The &s;hade of the trees, and the pale illu&s;ive light of the moon, led him into the error of &s;uppo&s;ing her to be the young Dutche&s;s; and he returned to his comrades to give them an account of this fortunate incident. Quite delighted at this information, they went &s;oftly down the walk, and &s;eized Emily ju&s;t as &s;he was &s;eating her&s;elf upon a bank of turf. That the error re&s;pecting her was not immediately detected, aro&s;e from the circum&s;tance which I have al|ready mentioned, of none of the&s;e men, ex|cepting her own treacherous &s;ervant, know|ing the Dutche&s;s; and he had now remained with the carriage in order to be ready in his office, as coachman, to &s;et off the moment that they had &s;ecured her.</P>
<P>As they undre&s;&s;ed Emily in the wood; this traitor fir&s;t perceived his mi&s;take, and was

more than once half inclined to di&s;cover it to his comrades; but as he con&s;idered that he &s;hould thereby lo&s;e his promi&s;ed recompence, he re&s;olved to keep his own &s;ecret. Be the unkown who &s;he will, he thought, &s;he will at la&s;t be known; and whatever &s;he may have endured, will probably be made ample amends for it. He let them go on therefore, and when they were happily arrived at the de&s;tined &s;tage, with &s;ome trepidation he a&s;ked for his reward; and when he had obtained this, he promi&s;ed indeed to carry the account of their proceedings to the hou&s;e-governor; but in&s;tead of doing it, he left the hor&s;es to run in the next wood, and went directly to Tyrol, on his way to his native town.</P>
<P>His departure made it impo&s;&s;ible for Emily and her conductors to come to any explana|tion, as none of them under&s;tood a word of German, and &s;he as little of Italian. Not|with&s;tanding this centainly doubtful circum|&s;tance, it never came into the mind of the otherwi&s;e &s;en&s;ible Captain, that there was any mi&s;take in this affair; for he was firmly convinced that the Dutche&s;s was only acting a part, becau&s;e &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf among&s;t &s;tran|gers, whom &s;he thought &s;he could mi&s;lead by affecting a total ignorance of her native lan|guage. Emily's eyes, her hair, her whole countenance, her &s;ize, an&s;wered &s;o exactly to
<PB N="193" REF="038544_0192_101254E88ADB24F0">
the de&s;cription of the fugitive, which he had often &s;tudied with great attention, that to que&s;tion this being her, &s;eemed almo&s;t impo&s;|&s;ible; and if he ever had any doubts of it, they were all at an end when he &s;aw a dia|mond cro&s;s upon her neck, exactly corre&s;|ponding to that de&s;cribed as worn by the Dutche&s;s, and which Emily had taken from among&s;t the jewels &s;ent by the Marquis, re|&s;olving to wear it as an everla&s;ting remem|brance of him. The impenetrable di&s;&s;imula|tion of his pri&s;oner, therefore, added much to her offence in the eyes of her conductor, and he often, for hours together, endeavoured in vain to impre&s;s her with this idea.</P>
<P>The joy of the old Duke was very great when he heard from the Captain of his daughter's being found, and placed in the convent. In the violence of his anger, on her fir&s;t going off, he had threatened to murder her with his own hand if he ever &s;aw her again; but time, and the long-felt ab&s;ence of this only and beloved child had moderated this terrible re&s;olution; and he was even con|&s;idering whether he &s;hould not forgive her, when a me&s;&s;enger arrived from the convent with an account of her being dangerou&s;ly ill, and not likely to recover. This intelligence, and her di&s;con&s;olate mother's mournful &s;hriek, made him tremble, and he directly
<PB N="194" REF="038544_0193_101254EA28A00E10">
re&s;olved that they &s;hould &s;et out together to vi&s;it their &s;ick child, and if their forgivene&s;s could &s;ave her, to grant it without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t after the Nuns had informed the Ab|be&s;s of Emily's death, the Duke and Dutche&s;s arrived at the convent, langui&s;hing to em|brace their daughter. The Abbe&s;s re|ceived her exalted gue&s;ts with a &s;orrowful countenance, and announced to them the fatal news of her decea&s;e. The Duke, &s;truck to the heart, remained &s;ilent for &s;ome time; at la&s;t he cried out, "It is hard, very hard, to have lo&s;t my only child &s;o long, and now to find her dead!" He tottered to a chair, and, without farther complaint, &s;at quite ab&s;orbed in his deep feelings. The old Dutche&s;s, weeping and lamenting bitterly, ha&s;tened to the cell to vi&s;it the death-bed of her daughter. "If I can no more," &s;he cried, "pre&s;s my living child to my brea&s;t, nothing &s;hall hinder me from ki&s;&s;ing her corp&s;e, and dying with her!" She threw her&s;elf down by Emily, and ki&s;&s;ed her pale face; but &s;tarted back, as &s;he, with a deep &s;igh, rai&s;ed her&s;elf up and &s;tared at the unknown Dutche&s;s. To de&s;cribe the &s;en&s;ations of the latter is not po&s;&s;ible. For one moment, her joy at finding her child, whom &s;he believed dead, &s;till liv|ing, was inexpre&s;&s;ible; but terror and a&s;to|ni&s;hment in&s;tantly &s;upplanted her joy, as &s;he
<PB N="195" REF="038544_0194_101254EE4A615170">
perceived that in&s;tead of being her, this was a per&s;on whom &s;he had never &s;een, before. The Nuns &s;tood by in amazement, and nei|ther party at all knew how to account for this extraordinary circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Emily &s;unk back upon her bed directly; &s;he felt her&s;elf better, but extremely weak. Her death-like &s;leep had been the cri&s;is of her fever, and the awakening her would have been very dangerous, if &s;he had not fallen into it again immediately. She was fa&s;t a&s;leep before the Dutche&s;s got breath to en|quire of tho&s;e about her the particulars of her being brought thither; on hearing which, &s;he was convinced that the conductors of Emily were either deceived them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion, or had deceived them for the &s;ake of the reward that they had offered for this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As Emily was the only per&s;on from whom the Dutche&s;s could hope for an explanation of this my&s;tery, &s;he recommended her ear|ne&s;tly to the care of the Nuns, and returned to the Duke to acquaint him with the mi&s;|take &s;he had di&s;covered. Without a mo|ment's delay he &s;ent off a me&s;&s;enger to the Captain who had left Emily at the convent, to de&s;ire that he would come to him, and in the meantime he continued there to await
<PB N="196" REF="038544_0195_101254F0B7FA1FB8">
her recovery. He heard from the Nuns that the &s;tranger &s;poke only German; but as he was ma&s;ter of that language, this was of no con&s;equence to him, and he was very impa|tient to &s;ee her. On the fourth day from her beginning to amend, &s;he found her&s;elf much better, and was able to conver&s;e; and, as ac|cording to the &s;trict rules of the place, no man, the phy&s;ician and confe&s;&s;or excepted, was permitted to vi&s;it the cells of the Nuns, &s;he was brought into an outward room, where the Duke was expecting her.</P>
<P>Emily wept for joy at being once more ad|dre&s;&s;ed in her mother tongue, which had a happier effect on her than all the medicines &s;he had taken. She an&s;wered all the Duke's enquiries; and it was with grief he found, that &s;he could not give him any account of his daughter.</P>
<P>The&s;e unhappy parents experienced ano|ther &s;imilar di&s;appointment on the arrival of the Captain, who heard of this mi&s;take with a&s;toni&s;hment. He owned that he had at fir&s;t almo&s;t doubted him&s;elf whether this could be the Dutche&s;s, but was confirmed in her being &s;o, on &s;eeing the brilliant cro&s;s upon her brea&s;t, which exactly an&s;wered the de&s;cripti|on of that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was &s;aid to wear. Her refu&s;|ing to &s;peak Italian he therefore con&s;idered
<PB N="197" REF="038544_0196_101254F255328768">
as mere di&s;&s;imulation, and had purpo&s;ely con|cealed it from her father, left it &s;hould &s;till more inflame his anger again&s;t her.</P>
<P>The cro&s;s was now produced, and imme|diately recognized by the Duke and Dutche&s;s as belonging to their daughter, and they pre&s;|&s;ed Emily to tell them where, and from whom &s;he had obtained it.</P>
<P>The innocent Emily related every thing that &s;he really knew, and much more that &s;he believed &s;he knew. She a&s;&s;ured the Duke that &s;he had received this cro&s;s, together with many other jewels, and a large &s;um of money from her lover, who was called the Marquis Lanego. He had been, &s;he &s;aid, &s;ome time about in their country, as a mou&s;e-trap and hatchel dealer, and had collected a great deal of the trea&s;ure which lay concealed in the Fichtelberg. That on the day in which they had fir&s;t become acquainted, he was mortally wounded in her pre&s;ence by two men in ma&s;ks, and, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, killed upon the &s;pot; but that &s;he heard of him af|terwards with a carriage, hor&s;es, and &s;ervants, travelling to a neighbouring town, from whence he had &s;ent her the money and jewels as a token of remembrance, and that he had died at another town upon the frontiers of Saxony.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="038544_0197_101254F3FB66D150">At fir&s;t the Duke con&s;idered this account as the delirium of her fever; but as &s;he con|&s;tantly repeated the &s;ame &s;tory, he knew not at la&s;t what to think or believe. The ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, who ran away with his daugh|ter, was named Lanego: he could only there|fore &s;uppo&s;e that this, in his e&s;timation, great villain, had &s;hamefully for&s;aken her, and di&s;|&s;ipated her fortune with another woman. If this was the ca&s;e, then his child, he reflected, might now be langui&s;hing in the mo&s;t ex|treme mi&s;ery; and wretched at this idea, he thought directly of going into Germany to &s;eek for her, but previou&s;ly he de&s;ired once more to talk with Emily, and begged her to relate the whole &s;tory circum&s;tantially. She accordingly did &s;o; and as &s;he now found that the Duke was in &s;earch of his daughter, whom the Marquis had carried off, it came at once into her mind whether the lady they had drawn out of the &s;haft might not be this daughter.</P>
<P>The Duke, on farther enquiry, was by degrees nearly convinced that this murder|ed lady was his child; but, in order to ob|tain greater certainty on this point, he re&s;olv|ed to go into Germany immediately. He concealed from the poor mother the new fears that he entertained, and flattered her
<PB N="199" REF="038544_0198_101254F8680A36B0">
with hopes of conducting his beloved daugh|ter again to her arms. With this pro&s;pect the Dutche&s;s &s;uffered him to go quietly, and on the third day he &s;et out with the Captain and Emily. The joy of the latter was with|out bounds, when &s;he heard that &s;he was to return to her native country, and &s;ee her mo|ther and the Counte&s;s again. This joy made her very talkative, and with the <HI>naivete</HI> of her manner &s;he often charmed the Duke from his reveries, and almo&s;t annihilated every &s;u&s;picion which he had &s;ecretly indulged again&s;t her. He began to believe her account to be literally true, and that &s;he, as well as his own daughter, had been innocently de|ceived by the arts of the Marquis. She won the heart of the Duke &s;o much during their long journey, that he often &s;wore in &s;ecret, if he found his own child dead, and Emily re|ally faultle&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould &s;upply her place to him, and &s;hould be his heire&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a journey of four weeks, the travellers arrived at the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;'s e&s;tate. Emily's heart overflowed with joy, as &s;he di&s;covered from a di&s;tance the turrets of the ca&s;tle, and the little white cottage in the wood. Her unaffected expre&s;&s;ions of de|light drew tears from the Duke, and &s;he confirmed her intere&s;t in his heart as &s;he ten|derly wiped away tho&s;e tears; and repeated|ly a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he would do every thing in her power to comfort him, if he did not find his child again.</P>
<P>As they drove into the court yard of the ca&s;tle, and the &s;ervants di&s;covered Emily, every one of them broke out into a loud cry of joy, and ran into the hou&s;e, which &s;oon re&s;ounded with the united &s;hout of "Emily is here again! Emily is here again!" The Counte&s;s von M&mdash;flew impetuou&s;ly to the window, and fell back in a &s;woon as &s;he &s;aw her child, whom &s;he believed to be dead.
<PB N="201" REF="038544_0200_101254FC79BC2AA8">
Emily hurried up &s;tairs, and found her in this &s;ituation; but her tears and her ki&s;&s;es &s;oon revived the fainting Counte&s;s; but &s;he could not &s;peak&mdash;&s;he could only feel, and locked her child in her arms.</P>
<P>The old Duke &s;tood there &s;peechle&s;s, and beheld this meeting with tears in his eyes. He was fully &s;en&s;ible of the delight it mu&s;t be to embrace a child again under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, from the eagerne&s;s with which he longed for it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When Emily was able to &s;peak, &s;he en|quired after her fo&s;ter-mother, and wi&s;hed to &s;hare her joy with her. On this the ma|ternal heart of the Counte&s;s was no more ma&s;ter of it&s;elf; &s;he knew that Emily mu&s;t take the old woman for her mother, and &s;he was envious of another's bearing away this tender appellation from her.&mdash;"Your old fo&s;ter-mother," &s;aid the Counte&s;s, "has died during your ab&s;ence; but Heaven has pre&s;erved your true mother in me. You are my child, and all the world &s;hall know that you are &s;o, and honour you as &s;uch."</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e of all the dome&s;tics pre&s;ent was very great; but the Counte&s;s continued her di&s;cour&s;e, and pre&s;ented Emily to them all, as her child, and as her heire&s;s. She &s;aw,
<PB N="202" REF="038544_0201_101254FEEEC9C0B0">
&s;he thought only of her; and was too much taken up for &s;ome time to notice the Duke, who had no inclination to interrupt &s;uch a &s;cene. After &s;he became a little more com|po&s;ed &s;he perceived him, and Emily pre&s;ent|ed him to her, her deliverer, her father.</P>
<P>"I am happy," &s;aid the Duke, almo&s;t over|come, "to have re&s;tored a lo&s;t child to your arms; but I am very &s;elfi&s;h, for I a&s;k of you a like return. It were cruel now to check your enjoyment; but when you can turn your attention to me, pity an afflicted father, who has &s;ought a lo&s;t child for a full year, and who hopes to learn tidings of her from you. Is my daughter really dead? Was &s;he the &s;tranger to whom you generou&s;ly gave a decent grave? Yet I do not wi&s;h to hear it to day; In the uncertainty of my fate, I will &s;atisfy my&s;elf with partaking your joy, and hoping that the &s;ame may yet be mine. But if my daughter really lives, then no longer delay the ble&s;&s;ed moment when I &s;hall pre&s;s her again to my childle&s;s bo&s;om." After a pau&s;e, the Duke added, "I know, I feel that it is in contradiction to my reque&s;t; but I can no longer &s;ubdue the emotions of my heart, which impetuou&s;ly demands intelli|gence of its darling."</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="038544_0202_1012550287C96880">The Counte&s;s, who was but ju&s;t relieved from a &s;imilar &s;ituation, was deeply affected by the Duke's di&s;tre&s;s, and found, with real &s;orrow, from his an&s;wers to her enquiries, that &s;he was under the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of rob|bing him of all hope. "Unfortunate old man," &s;he &s;aid, "your daughter is too &s;ure|ly dead! It is but too true that I fulfilled the la&s;t mournful duty to her, and that &s;he lies buried in the vault of my chapel."</P>
<P>The Duke gna&s;hed his teeth, and mur|mured &s;ome unintelligible words. "Oh, Madam!" he cried out at la&s;t, "the &s;e|vere&s;t torments are nothing to what I feel. To be childle&s;s in my old age, and not to have the &s;atisfaction of retaliating on the author of my mi&s;eries, what he has &s;o cruelly inflicted on me, my poor wife, and our only child, is too much. Mother or a child, pity me! If he is yet alive, and you know it, and conceal him from me, then may the cur&s;e fall on you, which my bleeding heart now teems with again&s;t him, but which my tongue has not power to utter!"</P>

<P>"Your affliction is ju&s;t, but the revenge you &s;eek, if it were po&s;&s;ible, would not &s;often it. The Marquis is dead; he was, as well as your daughter, murdered by a de&s;|perate banditti. He had, no doubt, injured

you, but he was faultle&s;s towards her. To the la&s;t hour of his life he loved her with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, and never would have &s;e|parated him&s;elf from her, but with the hope of its being for her &s;ecurity, and that it would be but for a &s;hort time."</P>

<P>The Counte&s;s related to the old Duke the hi&s;tory of the unfortunate lovers, as I have already related it to my readers. She had heard it from the Barone&s;s von Z&mdash;, who had vi&s;ited her, in the expectation of find|ing them under her protection. In&s;tead of which &s;he only heard the melancholy cata&s;|trophe, as &s;he did not doubt it would prove to be, of their fate; and the coffin of the murdered lady being opened to a&s;certain this, &s;he immediately knew her to be the young Dutche&s;s. As it appeared from the Barone&s;s, that Emily and Lanego were the names of the&s;e lovers, the Counte&s;s was &s;atisfied that the ca&s;ket &s;ent by the Notary was de&s;tined for the decea&s;ed, not for her daughter; and that the wounded Marquis who had &s;ent it, was not, as &s;he had &s;up|po&s;ed,
<PB N="206" REF="038544_0205_1012550A02E6A530">
the Savoyard who had been lately in that neighbourhood. There &s;till remained a my&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s in this affair, which the Counte&s;s and Barone&s;s could not &s;olve; but in forming their conjecture on it, they were induced to believe, that it mu&s;t have been the emi&s;&s;aries of the irritated Duke who were the murderers of the&s;e untimely victims, and they often execrated this unnatural revenge. But in another week this riddle was quite unfolded.</P>
<P>The wounded banditti put them&s;elves un|der the care of the &s;ame &s;urgeon who had dre&s;&s;ed the wounds of the decea&s;ed Marquis; and being &s;u&s;pected by him, they were, on his advice, arre&s;ted by the officers of ju&s;tice, and they immediately confe&s;&s;ed their guilt. Soon afterwards, the renowned Jacob was al&s;o taken as he was attempting to fly, and committed to pri&s;on. He was &s;ubject to the Counte&s;s, and con&s;equently was brought before her ju&s;ticiary, who, as was the cu&s;tom with tho&s;e who would not voluntarily con|fe&s;s their crimes, put him to the rack, and &s;oon extorted his confe&s;&s;ion. He not only acknowledged his recent murders, but al&s;o that he had deceived his neighbour, who had related it again to the Baron von Tiefenthal and the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, with a fabu|lous account of the means by which he had
<PB N="207" REF="038544_0206_1012550C744CF250">
acquired his fortune; and that the&s;e, tru&s;ting to his word, had taken a poor Savoyard for a Marquis, and that he had, for his own &s;ecu|rity, murdered the innocent creature.</P>
<P>This confe&s;&s;ion enabled the Counte&s;s to prove clearly to the Duke the innocence of the Marquis, and the mi&s;take of Emily; and this operated &s;o powerfully on him, that his ardent de&s;ire of revenge was extingui&s;hed, and &s;ucceeded by a deep &s;orrow. The idea of the per&s;ecuted lovers flying from one place to another, and being compa&s;&s;ionated by &s;tran|gers, who had endeavoured to protect them from his anger, affected him very &s;en&s;ibly. He wept bitterly; and though the tears flowed principally for his daughter, they fell al&s;o for the Marquis, whom he would now willingly have accepted for his &s;on-in-law. He begged pardon of the Counte&s;s for his injurious ex|pre&s;&s;ions towards her, and thanked her &s;in|cerely for the interment of his child. "To|morrow," he &s;aid," I will vi&s;it her &s;ad re|mains, and mourn over her coffin, which I will take with me; and if my old wife a&s;ks me whether I do not bring back her daughter, I will give it to her. That moment will cer|tainly be her la&s;t! but of what u&s;e are child|le&s;s parents in the world? They are like an arid tree, which if it is not thrown into the fire, only &s;tands mouldering to decay."</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="038544_0207_1012550EEB462BB8">The Counte&s;s endeavoured in vain to &s;ooth the old Duke; but the &s;oothings of Emily, who was already dear to him, and who became &s;till dearer, on being quite clear|ed from his &s;u&s;picions, were of much more ef|fect. "Be you," he cried out, tran&s;ported, as &s;he fell weeping upon his neck, "be you my &s;econd Emily. Fate has not brought you to my arms in vain. I feel that only your &s;ociety can con&s;ole me."</P>
<P>The Duke indeed &s;poke truly; for though he wept frequently, he always became calm when Emily wiped away his tears, and call|ed him father. As the Counte&s;s was very eager to learn how her daughter came into Italy, and met with him, he gave her the hi&s;|tory of her adventure, and &s;he then regretted that &s;he had never made &s;uch enquiries after her, as might have led to the di&s;covery of this circum&s;tance. But as &s;he was in her own mind fully convinced that &s;he al&s;o was mur|dered, nothing el&s;e had in her de&s;pair occur|ed to her, but to beg of the Ju&s;ticiary to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible means of making the banditti own where they had concealed the body, that &s;he might at lea&s;t have the &s;atisfaction of giving it honourable burial. But all the efforts of the Ju&s;ticiary to this effect were of cour&s;e of no avail; and the Counte&s;s was de|nied
<PB N="209" REF="038544_0208_10125510891758C8">
her wi&s;hed-for con&s;olation, of vi&s;iting the grave of her child.</P>
<P>In recounting over this &s;eries of events, it did not e&s;cape the recollection of the Counte&s;s, that &s;he was accountable to the Duke for the money and jewels which &s;he had received from the Marquis, as being the property of his daughter. "That I acknow|ledge my&s;elf your debtor," &s;he &s;aid, "and fully intend to repay what fell thus acci|dentally into my hands, will &s;ufficiently appear, from a letter which I wrote to you a month ago, mentioning this bu&s;ine&s;s, and the unhappy fate of the Dutche&s;s. At that time, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, my child was dead, and every thing on earth was become indifferent to me, I offered to repay the value of this de|po&s;it immediately, by the &s;ale of my e&s;tate; but now that I have her again, I wi&s;h to leave her my e&s;tate, and hope, from your genero&s;ity, to obtain time to re&s;tore, by pru|dent management, what &s;aved me from ruin."</P>
<P>The Duke a&s;&s;ured the Counte&s;s, that he never &s;hould de&s;ire, nor accept of any re&s;titu|tion; and as the Counte&s;s refu&s;ed this, he turned to Emily, and conjured her to grant this fir&s;t reque&s;t of her new father. Unable

to with&s;tand his earne&s;t entreaties, &s;he grate|fully accepted his munificent pre&s;ent, and put an end to this generous contention.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle now &s;hared a general joy, excepting the old Duke; for the lo&s;s of his child was too re|cent and too deeply felt, for him to take a part in it. As they were about to &s;it down to &s;upper, the Counte&s;s a&s;ked Emily, if &s;he thought no more of her Wolfgang. "It is not hand&s;ome," &s;he &s;aid, "thus &s;oon to have forgotten &s;o tender a lover."</P>
<P>Emily's cheeks were &s;uffu&s;ed with a deep blu&s;h at this que&s;tion. "Forgotten!" &s;he an&s;wered; "I &s;hall never forget him! He was very dear to me before, and his death and his innocence make his memory yet dearer to me. I &s;hould forget all my pa&s;t misfortunes, if he was but &s;till alive!"</P>

<P>At this moment Wolfgang came into the room, &s;imply, but very genteely dre&s;&s;ed. He had heard long before of Emily's arrival, and
<PB N="212" REF="038544_0211_101255194B8D88E8">
hurried to &s;ee her as &s;he came up &s;tairs, and thus thought him&s;elf prepared for this inter|view; but all his re&s;olution vani&s;hed as he approached to ki&s;s her hand, and congratulate her on her happy return. He trembled, he looked earne&s;tly at Emily; tears of joy &s;tart|ed into his eyes, and he could only &s;igh.</P>
<P>Emily was in a &s;imilar, or even more con|fu&s;ed &s;ituation. This unexpected meeting with a man whom &s;he loved, and lamented as dead, was almo&s;t too much for her. She in|voluntarily gave him one hand, and catch|ing his with the other, &s;unk &s;obbing into his arms.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s witne&s;&s;ed this mutual over|flow of tenderne&s;s with much emotion. "Sig|nor Tartini," &s;he &s;aid to Wolfgang, "you are right; the bond of pure love is eternal!"&mdash; "Yes indeed, eternal!" he cried out, quite tran&s;ported.&mdash;"Eternal! eternal!" &s;tammer|ed Emily after him.&mdash;As &s;he recovered a lit|tle from her a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;he began to a&s;k how it was po&s;&s;ible that he yet lived; that he who was &s;o dreadfully wounded, now &s;tood before her quite well?</P>
<P>As the like que&s;tion will no doubt be a&s;ked by my readers, I will relate his hi&s;tory in the
<PB N="213" REF="038544_0212_1012551BB98BD3A8">
mo&s;t conci&s;e manner po&s;&s;ible, to them and the enquiring Emily at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Wolfgang had indeed received two &s;tabs with a dagger from the wicked Jacob; but one of them had only bent a rib, and the other, from his giving a &s;udden turn, had on|ly cut the fle&s;h without injuring any vital part; but overcome by pain and terror, he fell apparently lifele&s;s to the ground, Jacob, in general unerring in his blow, believing him dead, e&s;caped with his colleague; and Emily went to fetch the old woman.</P>
<P>Wolfgang revived &s;hortly after, and his imagination picturing to him the&s;e murder|ers, as in league with the &s;orcerers, he exert|ed all his &s;trength, and fled. Notwith&s;tand|ing he endeavoured to tie up his wounds, they bled very much, and at the end of the wood he &s;unk down quite exhau&s;ted. There he was found by a &s;hepherd, who took him to his cottage, and tended him carefully. As per&s;ons of this de&s;cription have commonly &s;ome practical knowledge in phy&s;ic, he ap|plied the juice of certain herbs to his wounds, and nature operating yet more powerfully than the medicine, in four weeks he was able to leave his &s;traw bed.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="038544_0213_1012551E2FBC4E70">About this time his benefactor, who lived in a &s;olitary place, heard from a hunt&s;man who pa&s;&s;ed by his flock, the hi&s;tory of the banditti, with all the particulars before re|lated. The circum&s;tance of this di&s;covery be|ing made, by means of &s;ome wounded men belonging to this troop, excited &s;u&s;picions in the mind of the &s;hepherd. Perhaps, he thought, my gue&s;t is one of the&s;e wretches; and the certainty of his being an Italian con|firming this conjecture, in order to purify him&s;elf from all imputation of guilt for hav|ing harboured him, he left the flock to his &s;on's care, and went to the Ju&s;ticiary of the Counte&s;s, to whom he revealed what he &s;u&s;|pected. He, very naturally from this ac|count, immediately arre&s;ted Wolfgang, and threw him into pri&s;on.</P>
<P>His examination, by leading to the know|ledge of who he was, entirely exculpated him from the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, and gave the Counte&s;s the &s;atisfaction of finding that her Savoyard yet lived. He was directly relea&s;ed from con|finement, and as his wounds had grown wor&s;e in pri&s;on, &s;he took him into her hou&s;e to be taken care of till he was perfectly reco|vered. She was, by Jacob's confe&s;&s;ion, ap|prized of her error of his being a rich Mar|quis, and having the knowledge of concealed trea&s;ures; but as her heart was peculiarly
<PB N="215" REF="038544_0214_10125520A5707900">
open to compa&s;&s;ion by the lo&s;s of her child, and as he had &s;uffered &s;o much from her mi&s;|take about him; and had become dear to her daughter, inclination, as well as ju&s;tice, led her to pay him this attention.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s often vi&s;ited Wolfgang dur|ing this time; and be&s;ides her di&s;covering ma|ny good qualities in him, he gained on her af|fections by the cordial &s;hare he took in her affliction for the lo&s;t Emily, whom he lament|ed with &s;o much unfeigned tenderne&s;s, that &s;he wept in return with him, and was often obliged, in the mid&s;t of her own &s;orrow, to give him con&s;olation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Wolfgang's health was re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, the Counte&s;s gave him the appella|tion of her Secretary, clothed him properly, and let him eat at her table. He felt the&s;e beneficences deeply, &s;tudied with great dili|gence, and was not a&s;hamed at the age he then was, to learn to write, in order to be|come worthy of the title which his benefac|tre&s;s had at fir&s;t be&s;towed upon him &s;o unde|&s;ervedly. His continued application, his &s;in|cere gratitude, and his uncea&s;ing regret for Emily, &s;o won the heart of the Counte&s;s, that &s;he &s;oon loved him as her &s;on. It was in &s;hort with her as with the old Duke, that &s;he felt a cha&s;m in her heart, and wi&s;hed to fill it
<PB N="216" REF="038544_0215_1012552318D5B638">
up; thus &s;he hoped that Wolfgang would le&s;&s;en, if not &s;upply, the lo&s;s of Emily to her, when Emily her&s;elf appeared.</P>
<P>I will not be prolix on the conclu&s;ion to which my hi&s;tory now tends, as I hope my readers gue&s;s it already.</P>
<P>At the end of three months, Wolfgang and Emily were, with the con&s;ent of the noble mother, man and wife. If any of my readers wonder that a lady of rank could &s;o readily marry her only child to a poor young Savoy|ard pea&s;ant, I mu&s;t courteou&s;ly entreat them to remember, that &s;he was an illegitimate child, and having no pedigree of high decent, could never expect that a LEGITIMATE NO|BLE would marry her.</P>
<P>The old Duke, who became daily more at|tached to the&s;e young people, was pre&s;ent at their nuptials. His fir&s;t intention had been, to leave the ca&s;tle immediately after the full conviction of his misfortune, with the body of his dead child; but before he could &s;et out, he received advice by a courier of the death of his wife, who was unable to &s;upport the certain lo&s;s of her daughter, which &s;he had learned from the Counte&s;s's letter, &s;oon after his departure. He now therefore &s;tood more in need of con&s;olation, and was ea&s;ily pre|vailed
<PB N="217" REF="038544_0216_10125524B2F29A40">
on to &s;tay and receive it from Emily, who made it her &s;tudy to &s;often his affliction.</P>
<P>By the advice of the Duke, the Counte&s;s von M&mdash; &s;oon &s;old her e&s;tate, and went with him and her children into Italy. He there endowed our young Savoyard with con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and by his influence got him rai&s;ed to nobility; and the family of Wolfgang &s;till flouri&s;hes there in great af|fluence and re&s;pectability.</P>
<P>The Duke married the Counte&s;s von M&mdash;, and lived with her and his adopted children, during the remainder of his life, in perfect happine&s;s.</P>
