<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Matt. 19, 18.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;<HI>Je&s;us &s;aid, Thou &s;halt do no Murder.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE Words of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> are quoted from the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> of the <HI>ten Command|ments,</HI> which God publi&s;hed from <HI>Sinai,</HI> in the hearing of the main Body of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, and wrote on <HI>two Tables of Stone,</HI> that they might be a <HI>&s;tanding perpetual Rule</HI> for the Direction of their Conduct towards Him and one another. And as <HI>all</HI> the&s;e Commandments (the Fourth only excepted, and this only in part) are grounded on <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and not <HI>meer po&s;itive In&s;titution,</HI> they are <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> obligatory, &s;o far as Mankind are under Advantages to become ac|quainted with them. This is particularly true of the <HI>Commandment</HI> I have ju&s;t read to you; becau&s;e it took ri&s;e from that <HI>Fitne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Propriety</HI> of Action, which is everla&s;tingly due from Men towards each other, as they are <HI>all of one Blood,</HI> and endowed with the &s;ame <HI>common Right</HI> to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of Life here on Earth. And this <HI>Commandment</HI> is <HI>eminently</HI> bind|ing upon us <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as it has been adopted by our great Ma&s;ter and Lord into <HI>his Religion,</HI> and makes one of the important <HI>Laws of his Kingdom. Je&s;us &s;aid,
<PB N="6" REF="007168_0004_102ADE09EE07A548">
Thou &s;halt do no Murder.</HI> In di&s;cour&s;ing to which Words, I &s;hall endeavour two Things.</P>
<P>I. Fir&s;t, <HI>Explain</HI> the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> in which we are here commanded to <HI>do no Murder.</HI></P>
<P>II. Secondly, <HI>Enforce</HI> the Command, by repre&s;enting the <HI>horrid Nature,</HI> and <HI>enormous Guilt</HI> of the Sin of <HI>Murder.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall then conclude the Di&s;cour&s;e with the pro|per <HI>Application.</HI></P>
<P>I. Fir&s;t, I am to <HI>explain</HI> the Command, <HI>Thou &s;halt do no Murder.</HI></P>
<P>And it is plain, if one Man &s;hould &s;lay another by <HI>meer Chance,</HI> as we vulgarly &s;peak; that is, when he had no <HI>Intention</HI> to do it, nor any Thought of being the occa&s;ion of Hurt to him, in the lea&s;t, it is a <HI>Mi&s;|hap</HI> only, and not the <HI>Crime</HI> here cautioned again&s;t. Accordingly we find, that God him&s;elf, in this Ca&s;e, frees a Man from <HI>Guilt,</HI> ordaining that he &s;hall live. Deut. 19. 4, 5. <HI>Who&s;o killeth his Brother ignorantly, whom he hated not in Time pa&s;t, as when a Man goeth into the Wood with his Neighbour to hew Wood, and his Hand fetcheth a &s;troke with the Ax to cut down the Tree, and the Head &s;lippeth from the Helve, and lighteth upon his Neighbour that he die, he &s;hall&mdash;live.</HI> Only, it ought to be remembred here, <HI>Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI> is a <HI>Fault;</HI> and &s;hould we, in this Way, be the <HI>occa&s;ion,</HI> tho' <HI>accidental|ly,</HI> of the <HI>Death</HI> of another, we might have ju&s;t rea|&s;on for unea&s;y Reflections on our&s;elves; much more, if we were engaged in <HI>that</HI> which was in it &s;elf <HI>unwar|rantable</HI> and <HI>&s;inful.</HI></P>
<P>Again, If one Man &s;hould take away another's Life, in <HI>nece&s;&s;ary Self-Defence;</HI> as when, by being <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> and <HI>unavoidably</HI> a&s;&s;aulted, he is obliged to repel Force with
<PB N="7" REF="007168_0005_102ADE33C5A8D270">
Force, or run the Ri&s;que of lo&s;ing his own Life, he is not chargeable with the Sin of <HI>Murder.</HI> In Ca&s;es of this Sort, the Fault lies not with him that <HI>&s;lays,</HI> but with him who is <HI>&s;lain.</HI> The Man who was thus com|pelled to &s;mite his Brother is innocent. There is in|deed the Guilt of Blood; but it is wholly chargeable upon him who gave the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> for exerting the <HI>un|alienable Right,</HI> which Men have to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> them&s;elves. The <HI>Scripture</HI> therefore &s;ays, <HI>Exod.</HI> 22. 2. <HI>If a Thief be found breaking up, and be &s;mitten that he die, there &s;hall be no Blood &s;hed for him.</HI> He is him&s;elf the <HI>proper &s;ole</HI> Cau&s;e of this Evil; and ought therefore to be the <HI>only</HI> Sufferer for it. Tho' great Care &s;hould be taken, that Men do not needle&s;ly expo&s;e them&s;elves to the <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ity</HI> of exerting their <HI>Right of Self-Defence:</HI> nor &s;hould they ever exert this Right, in this <HI>extreme</HI> Ca&s;e, unle&s;s when the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> is <HI>real,</HI> and <HI>apparently un|avoidable.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, <HI>Enemies</HI> may be <HI>&s;lain</HI> in <HI>War,</HI> with|out any Breach of this <HI>Command:</HI> Always provided, the <HI>War</HI> is engaged in upon <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Rea&s;ons; as, to redre&s;s Injuries, guard again&s;t Wrongs and Violence, and &s;ecure the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Enjoyment of valuable Rights and Privileges; all other Methods having prov|ed ineffectual. In this Ca&s;e, it is rather a <HI>Virtue</HI> than a <HI>Crime,</HI> to be in&s;trumental in curbing the In&s;olence of Enemies, and weakning their Strength to injure and op|pre&s;s; tho' in the doing of it, Numbers of them &s;hould be <HI>&s;lain.</HI> They are indeed the <HI>faulty Cau&s;es</HI> of their own Death. The oppo&s;ing them with <HI>Force</HI> may pro|perly be con&s;idered as an Act of <HI>publick Ju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary Self-Defence;</HI> and tho&s;e who are <HI>active</HI> herein, in&s;tead of being <HI>faulted,</HI> ought to be <HI>applauded:</HI> And the more &s;ucce&s;sful they are in reducing <HI>&s;uch Enemies</HI> to <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> or <HI>De&s;truction,</HI> the more worthy they are of <HI>Honour.</HI> But if <HI>Wars</HI> are come into <HI>meerly</HI> to &s;erve the Ends of <HI>Pride, Ambition, Avarice,</HI> or any other <HI>Lu&s;t,</HI> either of the <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> or <HI>Mind,</HI> the <HI>Lives</HI> which are taken
<PB N="8" REF="007168_0006_102ADE0C3552AA50">
away in <HI>&s;uch Wars</HI> are really &s;o many <HI>horrid Murders.</HI> How far the <HI>immediate In&s;truments</HI> may be chargeable with <HI>Blame</HI> in God's Sight, may be difficult to deter|mine; but it is, at once, evident, that their <HI>Employers,</HI> the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates</HI> of the Earth, are, in this Ca&s;e, <HI>inhuman, cruel, barbarous Butchers</HI> of their Fellow-Men, and will be treated <HI>as &s;uch</HI> by the <HI>King of Kings,</HI> who <HI>re&s;pecteth not the Per&s;ons of Men;</HI> but will <HI>render to all,</HI> whether high or low, without favour or Affec|tion, <HI>according to their Deeds,</HI> in the Day of the appear|ing of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t to judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In fine, If Men are <HI>put to Death</HI> for <HI>Capital Crimes</HI> by Authority from the <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate,</HI> who is <HI>God's Mi|ni&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>holds the Sword</HI> for this very Purpo&s;e, it is not a Tre&s;pa&s;s upon my Text; but an act of <HI>publick Service,</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>well-being of Society;</HI> which could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if wicked and violent Men &s;hould be &s;uffered, with Impunity, to invade the Rights of others, as their ungoverned Lu&s;ts might prompt them thereto.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ca&s;es being excepted, the Sin forbidden in this <HI>Commandment,</HI> is the <HI>voluntary taking away another's Life without Cau&s;e, or without a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary one:</HI> Upon what <HI>Motive</HI> &s;oever it is done, whether from Hatred, or Malice, or Envy, or Revenge, or pre&s;umed Safety, or pretended Reparation of Honour: Or, by what <HI>Means</HI> &s;oever it be effected; whether by direct Violence, or fraudulent Contrivance; in an open, or clande&s;tine Manner; immediately by our&s;elves, or by the In&s;tru|mentality of others. Or if Life &s;hould not be <HI>actually</HI> taken away, yet is this Commandment violated, at lea&s;t, in the all &s;eeing View of God, if it was <HI>endeavoured,</HI> and &s;uch Endeavour would have taken Effect, had it not been counter-acted by &s;ome unfore&s;een Turn or o|ther in the Conduct of Providence; as in the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who entered into a Con&s;piracy to kill <HI>Paul,</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="007168_0007_102ADE362FB93960">
laid wait for him, in pro&s;ecution of this bloody De&s;ign, but were hindred, beyond their own Intention, from ac|compli&s;hing it; <HI>Acts</HI> 23. 12, 14.</P>
<P>This now is the Crime which is here forbidden; and it is a <HI>more</HI> or a <HI>le&s;s</HI> aggravated one, in proportion to the <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> that attend it. If the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> upon another's Life was not <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> excited; but took ri&s;e from <HI>cool, deliberate, &s;ettled, Hatred and Malice,</HI> it is <HI>Murder</HI> in the <HI>gro&s;&s;e&s;t</HI> Sen&s;e. Nor will the <HI>Manner</HI> in which it was committed make any con&s;iderable Dif|ference in the <HI>Degree of Guilt.</HI> It is <HI>Murder of the deepe&s;t Dye.</HI></P>
<P>It is <HI>Murder</HI> al&s;o, tho' in a <HI>le&s;s</HI> criminal Sen&s;e, when Life is taken away, not from a <HI>&s;ettled Principle</HI> of <HI>calm</HI> and <HI>deliberate</HI> Malice, but in con&s;equence of <HI>&s;udden An|ger</HI> heightened into <HI>Rage</HI> and <HI>Fury.</HI> What Allowances <HI>human Laws,</HI> under &s;ome Governments, may make for &s;udden Tran&s;ports of Pa&s;&s;ion, and how far, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, they may be &s;atisfied without the <HI>Blood</HI> of the guilty Per&s;on, I pretend not to determine; but, in true <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> it is evidently <HI>unfit,</HI> that <HI>Life</HI> &s;hould be continually expo&s;ed to hazard, from the turbulent and ungoverned Wrath of Men. This would be to &s;ubject quiet and peaceable Members of Society to the greate&s;t <HI>Hard&s;hips,</HI> by <HI>con&s;tructively</HI> giving Encourage|ment to <HI>angry Men</HI> to vent their Fury on them. It is plain, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Life is not &s;o &s;trongly guard|ed and &s;ecured as it might be, and ought to be, in well regulated Society, if <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> Men may be indulged the Liberty of &s;laying their Neighbours; provided they are able to plead, they were in a <HI>Fit of Rage,</HI> not hav|ing the government of them&s;elves, and not knowing what they did. This, at be&s;t, is only making one Crime an Excu&s;e for another; which if allowed as valid, and &s;ufficient to wipe off the <HI>Guilt of Blood,</HI> no one can enjoy his Life with &s;afety. That <HI>Anger</HI> in|crea&s;ing

into Rage, which hurries a Man on wickedly and injuriou&s;ly to invade his Neighbour, and deprive him of Life, is <HI>murderous</HI> in the Eye of <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and in the Eye of God, and it is Pity if it is not, in all Places, &s;o e&s;teemed, by the <HI>Law of Man.</HI> I now proceed,</P>
<P>II. In the &s;econd Place, to <HI>enforce</HI> the Command in my Text, by repre&s;enting the <HI>horrid Nature</HI> of this Sin of <HI>Murder.</HI></P>
<P>It is indeed one of the <HI>blacke&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>mon&s;trous</HI> Sins, and &s;o e&s;teemed both by <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>It is mentioned by Name, in the &s;acred Writings, as a Sin which is eminently <HI>hateful</HI> to <HI>God. P&s;alm 5. 6. The Lord will abhor the bloody Man. Prov. 6. 16, 17. Hands that &s;hed innocent Blood are an Abomination to the Lord.</HI> And he has accordingly te&s;tified his great Di&s;|plea&s;ure again&s;t this Sin, even from the Beginning of the World. That was his Language to <HI>Cain,</HI> the Son of the fir&s;t Man that ever lived, upon having <HI>murdered</HI> his Brother <HI>Abel. Gen. 4. 10, 11. 12. What ha&s;t thou done? The Voice of thy Brother's Blood crieth to me from the Ground. And now thou art cur&s;ed from the Earth, which hath opened her Mouth to receive thy Brother's Blood from thy Hand.&mdash;A fugitive and a Vagabond &s;halt thou be in the Earth.</HI> An awful Puni&s;hment this! And well might <HI>Cain</HI> break forth, and &s;ay, as in the Words that next follow, <HI>My Puni&s;hment is greater than I can bear!</HI> It may be worthy Ob&s;ervation, The mo&s;t awfully &s;evere and exten&s;ive Judgment God, was ever plea&s;ed to vi&s;it this World of ours with, was <HI>its De&s;truction by a Deluge of Water,</HI> one Family only excepted; and the Rea&s;on is given, <HI>Gen. 6. 11. Becau&s;e the Earth was filled with Violence.</HI> And it was to prevent <HI>&s;uch Violence</HI> in the <HI>new Generations</HI> that might proceed out of the Loins of <HI>Noah,</HI> that God made it a <HI>&s;tanding perpetual Law. Gen.</HI> 9. 5, 6. <HI>At the Hand of every Man's Bro|ther

will I require the Life of Man. Who&s;o &s;heddeth Man's Blood, by Man &s;hall his Blood be &s;hed.</HI> And when he took upon him&s;elf the more <HI>&s;pecial Government</HI> of the Nation of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he peremptorily annexed the Sentence of <HI>Death,</HI> to the Law again&s;t <HI>Murder.</HI> And that it might be known what Murder was, he &s;ays, concerning every Man that &s;hould kill his Neighbour, as in <HI>Numb.</HI> 35. 16. <HI>And if he &s;mite him with an In&s;tru|ment of Iron, &s;o that he die, he is a Murderer: The Mur|derer &s;hall &s;urely be put to Death.</HI> It follows, in the next Ver&s;e, <HI>And if he &s;mite him with throwing a Stone, and he die: he is a Murderer: The Murderer &s;hall &s;urely be put to Death.</HI> It is yet added in the following Ver&s;e, which may be worthy of Notice, upon this Occa&s;ion, <HI>or if he &s;mite him with a hand-weapon of Wood (wherewith he may die) and he die; he is a Murderer: The Murderer &s;hall &s;urely be put to Death.</HI> And it is farther ob&s;ervable, the Sovereign Lord of Life was plea&s;ed mo&s;t &s;olemnly, and in expre&s;s Words, to prohibit <HI>the taking any Sati&s;|faction for the Life of a Murderer,</HI> as in the 30th and 31&s;t Ver&s;es of this Chapter, <HI>Who&s;o killeth any Per&s;on, the Murderer &s;hall be put to Death&mdash;ye &s;hall take no Satisfaction for the Life of a Murderer; but he &s;hall &s;urely be put to Death.</HI> And that this Law might not be evaded, by the Flight of <HI>Murderers</HI> to any of the <HI>Cities of Refuge</HI> (a Number of which were appointed for the Protection of tho&s;e, who tho' they had <HI>killed others,</HI> yet were not chargeable with <HI>Murder</HI>) he particularly ordained, <HI>Deut.</HI> 19. 12. <HI>That they &s;hould be fetched thence, and delivered into the Hands of the Avenger of Blood, that they might die.</HI></P>
<P>But more than all this, the holy God, to &s;ignify his great Indignation again&s;t this Sin of <HI>Murder,</HI> has par|ticularly rank't it, in the Revelation of his Will by his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, among tho&s;e <HI>Crimes</HI> which, if not repented of, will certainly be a Bar in the Way of Men's obtaining <HI>Life in Heaven,</HI> according to 1 <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="007168_0010_102ADE53B7AB4820">
3. 15. <HI>No Murderer hath eternal Life;</HI> yea, he has mentioned it, by Name, as a <HI>Sin</HI> that will, without &s;incere Repentance, expo&s;e Men to the <HI>&s;econd Death,</HI> or, which means the &s;ame Thing, <HI>the Fire of Hell,</HI> accor|ding to <HI>Rev.</HI> 21. 8. <HI>Murderers &s;hall have their Part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone: which is the &s;econd Death.</HI></P>
<P>And as this Sin of <HI>Murder</HI> is thus &s;ingularly <HI>foul</HI> and <HI>black</HI> in the E&s;teem of <HI>God,</HI> &s;o it is likewi&s;e in the Account of <HI>Man.</HI> It is indeed a Crime that is <HI>&s;hocking</HI> to the human Mind, unle&s;s when abandoned to all Sen&s;e of what is right and fit: Nor are there many, however debauched in their Principles, and di&s;&s;olute in their Manners, but would find within them&s;elves <HI>unea&s;y Emotions</HI> of Soul at the Thought of committing a <HI>bar|barous Murder;</HI> adopting the Language of <HI>Hazael,</HI> and &s;aying, <HI>Is thy Servant a Dog that he &s;hould do this Thing?</HI> All civilized Nations have, as one, united in ranking <HI>Murder</HI> among the mo&s;t <HI>enormous Crimes,</HI> and guarding again&s;t it by enacting <HI>Laws</HI> with the Sanction of <HI>Death.</HI> We know indeed of no People, however rude and un|cultivated, in other Re&s;pects, but have entertained a kind of <HI>Horror</HI> at the Sin of <HI>Murder;</HI> judging it wor|thy of &s;ome remarkable Puni&s;hment. Hence the <HI>Bar|barians,</HI> at <HI>Melita,</HI> rea&s;oned among them&s;elves, as in <HI>Acts</HI> 28. 4. <HI>No doubt this Man is a Murderer&punc; whom, tho' he hath e&s;caped the Sea, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Vengeance &s;uffereth not to live.</HI> And even <HI>Murderers</HI> them&s;elves, when they come coolly to reflect upon what they have done, are commonly filled with great <HI>inward Remor&s;e;</HI> turning upon them|&s;elves with the keene&s;t re&s;entments of their Folly. And &s;hould they e&s;cape the <HI>Vengeance</HI> of Man, they &s;carce ever after enjoy them&s;elves, or take Comfort in Life.

chu&s;ing rather to die by the <HI>Hands of Ju&s;tice,</HI> than to drag on Life under the unea&s;y Sen&s;ations of a con|tinually Self-condemning Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>And it is upon <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Grounds, that <HI>Mur|der</HI> is thus reckoned by <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> as one of the <HI>blacke&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>mon&s;trous</HI> Crimes, and felt to be &s;o by <HI>Murderers</HI> them&s;elves: For it carries in it, in an high Degree, <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s, Inju&s;tice,</HI> and <HI>Impiety;</HI> each of which are in them&s;elves great Breaches upon the Law of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Charity,</HI> or <HI>Love</HI> to our Neighbour is the <HI>&s;econd</HI> &s;um|mary <HI>Commandment;</HI> and like the fir&s;t, which requires <HI>Love to God,</HI> it is great and important. <HI>On the&s;e two Commandments hang the Law and the Prophets,</HI> the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> and the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> We are de&s;titute of all Virtue and Religion, if we do not <HI>love God;</HI> and it is a vain Thing to pretend that we love God, if we love not our Neighbour al&s;o. For as the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;peaks, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4. 20. <HI>If a Man &s;ays that he loves God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Liar; for he that loveth not his Bro|ther, whom he hath &s;een, cannot love God whom he hath not &s;een.</HI> And what &s;tronger Evidence can a Man give, that he don't love his Brother, than embruing his Hands in his Blood? This is the &s;tronge&s;t Proof of his be|ing entirely void of that Chri&s;tian Temper which is kind, and gentle, and peaceable, and apt to put one upon walking with all Lowlin&s;s, and Meekne&s;s, and Long|&s;uffering; forbearing and forgiving one another in Love. To be &s;ure, when one Man is urged on to &s;lay ano|ther from <HI>Hatred</HI> and <HI>Malice, deliberate</HI> and <HI>premeditated,</HI> he di&s;covers <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s,</HI> in the highe&s;t Degree; yea, <HI>Inhumanity</HI> and <HI>Barbarity</HI> reign in him, in|&s;tead of <HI>Good-Will</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian Piety.</HI> To hate a Brother to the Death is the utmo&s;t Pitch of Hatred. And if, in imitation of our Ma&s;ter and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and out of re&s;pect to him, we ought to be

willing to lay down our Lives for the Brethren, it mu&s;t be a mo&s;t enormous Breach of <HI>Chri&s;tian Charity</HI> for a Man wilfully, and without Cau&s;e, to take away his Brother's Life.</P>
<P><HI>Judgment</HI> is as <HI>weighty</HI> a matter of God's Law as Mercy; for the Lord our God hath particularly required it of us <HI>to do Ju&s;tice.</HI> But the <HI>Murderer</HI> outragiou&s;ly tran&s;gre&s;&s;eth the Rule of Right; invading his Neigh|bour's Property, in the mo&s;t indi&s;putable Ca&s;e: For the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Life is what he claims by <HI>immediate Grant</HI> from the great Sovereign of the Univer&s;e. And by invading this Right he does him the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible Injury; for he deprives him of the mo&s;t <HI>valuable Good.</HI> Nothing indeed, in all the World, is &s;o precious as Life; for it is the <HI>Foundation</HI> of all other Enjoyments, and ju&s;tly preferable to them all. The Father of Lies therefore &s;pake Truth, when he &s;aid, as in <HI>Job</HI> 2. 9. <HI>Skin for Skin, all that a Man hath will he give for his Life.</HI> Nor can the Lo&s;s of it be repaired or compen&s;ated. He that lo&s;eth his Life, lo&s;eth therewith all future Capacity of Enjoyment in this World, without any Po&s;&s;ibility of recovering it again. It is therefore the highe&s;t and mo&s;t aggravated Injury that can be done to a Man to take away his Life unju&s;tly. It, in a manner, in|finitely &s;urpa&s;&s;es every other Evil, whether in Name, E&s;tate, or bodily Welfare in any Kind; for the&s;e <Q>have their Mea&s;ure, and may be capable of &s;ome Reparation: But this is altogether extreme and ir|reparable.</Q></P>
<P>Be&s;ides it ought to be remembred here, when a Man wickedly &s;lays his Brother, he not only, at once, turns him out of all Capacity of enjoying any farther Good in this World, but deprives him of the Time he might otherwi&s;e have had to make Preparation for <HI>another World,</HI> and may be the <HI>Means</HI> of his being <HI>tormented,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>comforted</HI> there.

not only robs him of his <HI>temporal Life,</HI> and all <HI>Temporal Good</HI> therewith; but of his <HI>Space for Repen|tance,</HI> and Opportunity to make his Peace with God, and to get into good Terms with Heaven: And if he &s;hould <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> di&s;patch him into the other World, and in his Sins too, as, it may be feared, is too often the Ca&s;e, he is, in a Sen&s;e, the Murderer of his <HI>Soul,</HI> as well as Body, and may properly be charged with bringing upon him the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> as well as the <HI>fir&s;t Death.</HI> A very &s;erious and awful Truth this! And if it were duly attended to, might, under the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, be happily influential to re&s;train from the horrid Sin of <HI>Murder.</HI> It is not confined, in its Con&s;equences, to the pre&s;ent World; but may prove <HI>injurious</HI> to our poor innocent Brother, innocent as to us, beyond the Grave, in the <HI>Re&s;urrection World.</HI> Many a poor Sinner, it may be feared, by the Murder of his Body, has been <HI>virtually</HI> and <HI>con&s;tructively</HI> murdered in his <HI>Soul</HI> al&s;o.

<P>I may &s;till add here, the <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> involved in the Sin of <HI>Murder,</HI> affects others be&s;ides the Man him&s;elf that is turned out of Life.

<P>It argues al&s;o <HI>Impiety</HI> again&s;t God, and to a great Degree; for it is a downright Encroachment upon, and U&s;urpation of, that <HI>Right over Life,</HI> which the So|vereign Lord of the Univer&s;e has re&s;erved to be exer|ci&s;ed by <HI>him&s;elf only,</HI> or by his <HI>Vice-gerents</HI> in certain Ca&s;es, wherein the Good of Society may make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary.&mdash;And it is, in another Re&s;pect, an high Indig|nity offered to God; for it di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es him of his <HI>ju&s;t Property,</HI> by virtually robbing him of a <HI>Creature</HI> whom his Hands have formed; yea, of a <HI>Servant</HI> and <HI>Subject,</HI> from whom he might have received a Revenue of Honour and Service.

If any &s;hould&punc; cur&s;e, we &s;hall be ready to ble&s;s; if any &s;hould re|vile, we, in&s;tead of reviling again, &s;hall leave our Ca&s;e with God, who judgeth righteou&s;ly; and in&s;tead of being overcome with Evil, we &s;hould overcome Evil with Good. And being thus fitted in the Temper of our Minds for the Society of Angels and glorified Saints, we &s;hall, in God's Time, be admitted to dwell with them in that World, where there is no Variance nor Strife, but everla&s;ting Peace and Concord, and tho&s;e mutual Offices of Love and Friend&s;hip, which will make us the Delight of one another, and the Delight of God, from who&s;e Pre&s;ence will flow to us Rivers of Plea&s;ure for evermore. God grant it may be the Portion of us all, for his Mercy's Sake, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
