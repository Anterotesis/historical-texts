<HEAD>INTERESTING HISTORY OF THE Baron de LOVZINSKI.</HEAD>
<P>MY hi&s;tory pre&s;ents a frightful ex|ample of the in&s;tability of fortune. It is indeed very flattering, but it is al&s;o &s;ome|times very dangerous, to have an ancient title to &s;u&s;tain, and a large e&s;tate to pre|&s;erve. The &s;ole de&s;cendant of an illu&s;|trious family, who&s;e origin is lo&s;t in the darkne&s;s of remote ages, I have a right to a&s;pire to, and to occupy the fir&s;t em|ployments in the republic which gave me birth, and yet I behold my&s;elf con|demned to langui&s;h in a foregin coun|try, amid&s;t an indolent and inglorious ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The name of Lovzin&s;ki is honorably mentioned in the annals of Poland, and that name is about to peri&s;h with my&s;elf?

I know that an au&s;tere philo&s;ophy eithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rejects or de&s;pi&s;es vain titles and corrup+ting riches; and perhaps I &s;hould con&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my&s;elf if I had lo&s;t only the&s;e; but, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> weep for an adored &s;pou&s;e, I &s;earch after a beloved daughter, and I &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> never more revi&s;it my native land.

<P>To &s;ay that it was the re&s;emblance of our characters, and the &s;ympathy of our di&s;po&s;itions, that occa&s;ioned my attach|ment to M. de P&mdash;, would be to pay my&s;elf too flattering a compliment; however that may be, we both lived to|gether in the mo&s;t intimate familiarity.</P>
<P>How happy, but how fleeting is that time of life, when one is unacquainted with ambition, which &s;acrifices every thing to the de&s;ire of fortune and the glory that follows in her train, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ove, the &s;upreme power of which ab&s;orbs and concentres all our faculties upon one &s;ole object! that age of innocent plea&s;|ures, and of confident credulity, when the heart, as yet a novice, follows the

<P>The confident of all the &s;ecrets of M. de P&mdash;, I my&s;elf undertook nothing with|out fir&s;t intru&s;ting him with my de&s;igns; his coun&s;els regulated my conduct, mine determined his re&s;olution; our youth had no plea&s;ures which were not &s;hared, no misfortunes which were not &s;olaced by our mutual attachment.</P>
<P>With what chagrin did I not perceive that fatal moment arrive, when my friend, obliged by the commands of a father to depart from War&s;aw, prepared to take leave of me! We promi&s;ed to pre&s;erve for ever that lively affection which had con&s;tituted the chief happine&s;s of our youth, and I ra&s;hly &s;wore that the pa&s;|&s;ions of a more advanced age &s;hould ne|ver alter it.</P>

my lei&s;ure moments with &s;ome u&s;eful pur|&s;uit. I therefore cultivated the French language, already e&s;teemed throughout all Europe; I read with delight tho&s;e fa|mous works, the eternal monuments of genius, which it had produced; and I wondered, that notwith&s;tanding &s;uch an ungrateful idiom, &s;o many celebrated po|ets, &s;o many excellent philo&s;ophers and hi&s;torians, ju&s;tly immortalized, had been able to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by its means.</P>
<P>I al&s;o applied my&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to the &s;tudy of geometry; I formed my mind in a particular manner to the pur&s;uit of that noble profe&s;&s;ion which makes a hero at the expence of one hundred thou&s;and unfortunates, and which men le&s;s human than valiant have called the grand art of war! Several years were employed in the&s;e pur&s;uits, which are equally difficult and laborious; in &s;hort, they &s;olely occupied my thoughts. M. de P&mdash;, who often wrote to me, no longer received any but &s;hort replies, and our corre&s;pondence began to langui&s;h by neglect, when at length love fini&s;hed the triumph over friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>My father had been for a long time intimately connected with Count Pula&s;ki.
<PB N="8" REF="037849_0005_100F848D7270BC28">
Celebrated for the au&s;terity of his man|ners, famous on account of the inflexibil|ity of his virtues, which were truly repub|lican, Pula&s;ki, at once a great captain and a brave &s;oldier, had on more than one occa&s;ion &s;ignalized his fiery courage, and his ardent patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>In&s;tructed in ancient literature, he had been taught by hi&s;tory the great le&s;&s;ons of a noble di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, an immovea|ble con&s;tancy, an ab&s;olute devotion to glo|ry. Like tho&s;e heroes to whom idola|trous but grateful Rome elevated altars, Pula&s;ki would have &s;acrificed all property to the pro&s;perity of his country; he would have &s;pilled the la&s;t drop of his blood for its defence; he would even have immolated his only, his beloved daugh|ter, Lodoi&s;ka.</P>
<P>Lodoi&s;ka! how beautiful! how love|ly! her dear name is always on my lips, her adored remembrance will live for ever in my heart!</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t moment that I &s;aw this fair maid, I lived only for her; I aban|doned my &s;tudies; friend&s;hip was entire|ly forgotten. I con&s;ecrated all my mo|ments to Lodoi&s;ka. My father and hers could not be long ignorant of my attachment; they did not chide me for

it; they mu&s;t have approved it then? This idea appeared to me to be &s;o well found|ed, that I delivered my&s;elf up without &s;u&s;picion, to the &s;weet pa&s;&s;ion that enchant|ed me; and I took my mea&s;ures &s;o well, that I beheld Lodoi&s;ka almo&s;t daily, ei|ther at home, or in company with my &s;i&s;|ters, who loved her tenderly:&mdash;two &s;weet years flew away in this manner.</P>
<P>At length Pula&s;ki took me one day a&s;ide, and addre&s;&s;ed, me thus: "Your father and my&s;elf have formed great hopes of you, which your conduct has hitherto ju&s;tified; I have long beheld you employ|ing your youth in &s;tudies equally u&s;eful and honorable. To-day&mdash;(He here per|ceived that I was about to interrupt him) What would you &s;ay? Do you think to tell me any thing I am unacquainted with? Do you think that I have occa&s;ion to be hourly witne&s;s of your tran&s;ports, to learn how much my Lodoi&s;ka merits to be beloved?

love it&s;elf, like the ba&s;e&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ions, is either de&s;picable or dangerous, if it does not offer to generous hearts an ad|ditional motive to excite them towards honor.</P>
<P>"Hear me: Our monarch for a long time in a &s;ickly habit of body, &s;eems at length to approach towards his end. His life, become every day more precarious, has awakened the ambition of our neigh|bors. They doubtle&s;s prepare to &s;ow di|vi&s;ions among us; and they think that by over-awing our &s;uffrages, they will be en|abled to force upon us a king of their own chu&s;ing. Foreign troops have al|ready dared to appear on the frontiers of Poland; already two thou&s;and Poli&s;h gentlemen have a&s;&s;embled, on purpo&s;e to puni&s;h their audacious in&s;olence. Go and join your&s;elf with tho&s;e brave youths; go, and at the end of the campaign return covered with the blood of our enemies, and &s;hew to Pula&s;ki a &s;on-in-law worthy of him!"</P>
<P>I did not he&s;itate a &s;ingle moment; my father approved of my re&s;olutions, but being unable to con&s;ent without pain to my precipitate departure, he pre&s;&s;ed me for a long lime again&s;t his bo&s;om, while a tender &s;olicitude was depicted in

all his looks; his adieus &s;eemed to be i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;picious; the trouble that agitated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eart &s;eized upon my own; our tears were mingled on his venerable cheeks. Pula&s;ki, who was pre&s;ent at this moving &s;cene, &s;toically reproached us for what he termed a weakne&s;s. Dry up your tears, &s;aid he to me, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre&s;erve them for Lo|doi&s;ka; it belongs only to childi&s;h lovers who &s;eparate them&s;elves from each other for five or &s;ix months, to weep in this manner! He in&s;tructed his daughter in my pre&s;ence, both of my departure, and of the motives which determined me to it. Lodoi&s;ka grew pale, &s;ighed, looked at her father with a face &s;uffu&s;ed with blu&s;hes, and then a&s;&s;ured me in a trem|bling voice, that her vows &s;hould be of|fered up for my &s;afe return, and that her happine&s;s depended on the &s;afety of Lovzin&s;ki.</P>
<P>Encouraged in this manner, what dan|gers had I to fear? I departed according|ly, but in the cour&s;e of that campaign, there happened nothing worthy of nar|ration; the enemy, equally careful with our&s;elves to avoid any action which might produce an open war between the two nations, contented them&s;elves with fa|tiguing us by means of frequent marches:
<PB N="12" REF="037849_0007_100F8490F96567B8">
we, on the other hand, bounded our views to following and ob&s;erving them; and they only &s;eemed to oppo&s;e them&s;elves to us, in tho&s;e parts where the open coun|try afforded them an opportunity of ma|king good their retreat.</P>
<P>At the end of the campaign they pre|pared to retire on purpo&s;e to take up their winter quarters in their own coun|try; and our little army compo&s;ed al|mo&s;t wholly of gentlemen, &s;eparated &s;oon after.</P>
<P>I returned to War&s;aw full of joy and impatience; I thought that Love and Hy|men were about to be&s;tow Lodoi&s;ka on me. Alas! I no longer had a father. I learned, on entering the capital, that Lovzin&s;ki died of an apoplexy on the night before my arrival. Thus I was deprived, of even the &s;ad con&s;olation of receiving the la&s;t &s;ighs of the mo&s;t tender of parents; I could only offer up my &s;or|rows at his tomb, which I bathed with my tears!</P>
<P>&mdash;"It is not," &s;ays Pula&s;ki to me&punc; who was but little moved with my pro|found &s;orrow&mdash;"it is not by barren tears that you can do honour to a father &s;uch as thine. Poland in him regrets a Citi|zen&mdash;a hero, who would have been of

<P>"Of all the rights which the death of your father tran&s;mits to you, the mo&s;t noble is undoubtedly that of a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the Diet, in which you are to repre&s;ent him; it is there, where he will revive in you&punc; it is there, where you ought to exhibit a courage infinitely more difficult to be &s;u&s;|tained than that which con&s;i&s;ts only in braving death in the field of battle!</P>
<P>"The valour of a &s;oldier is nothing more than a common virtue; but they are not ordinary men who on awful emer|gencies, pre&s;erving a tranquil courage, and di&s;playing an active penetration, di&s;cover the projects of the powerful who cabal, di&s;concert the enterpri&s;es of the intrigu|ing, and confront the de&s;igns of the fac|tious; who, always firm, incorruptible, and ju&s;t, give not their &s;uffrages but to tho&s;e whom they think mo&s;t worthy of them; whom neither gold nor promi&s;es can &s;educe, whom prayers cannot bend, whom menaces cannot terrify.</P>
<P>"The&s;e were the virtues which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="14" REF="037849_0008_100F8494D0238010">
your father; this is the precious inheritance which you ought to be de&s;ir|ous of &s;u&s;taining.&mdash;The day on which the &s;tates a&s;&s;emble for the election of a king, will be the epoch on which the pre|tentions of many of our fellow-citizens, more occupied with their private intere&s;ts than jealous of the pro&s;perity of their country, will be manife&s;ted, as well as the pernicious de&s;igns of the neighbouring powers, who&s;e cruel policy it is, to de&s;troy our &s;trength by dividing it.</P>
<P>"I am deceived, my friend, if the fa|tal moment is not fa&s;t approaching, which will forever fix the de&s;tinies of our coun|try&mdash;its enemies have con&s;pired its ruin; they have &s;ecretly prepared for a revolu|tion, but they &s;hall not con&s;ummate their purpo&s;es while my arm can &s;u&s;tain a &s;word! May that God, who is the pro|tector of the republic, prevent all the horrors of a civil war! But that extremi|ty, however frightful it appears, may per|haps become nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er my&s;elf that it will be but a &s;hort, although per|haps a violent cri&s;is, after which the re|generated &s;tate will a&s;&s;ume its ancient &s;plendour.</P>
<P>"You &s;hall &s;econd my efforts, Lov|zin&s;ki; the feeble intere&s;ts of love ought
<PB N="15" REF="037849_0008_100F8494D0238010">
to di&s;appear before more &s;acred claims. I cannot pre&s;ent my daughter to you du|ring this awful moment of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, when our common country is in danger; but I promi&s;e to you, that the fir&s;t days of peace &s;hall be marked by your union with Lo|doi&s;ka.</P>
<P>Pula&s;ki did not &s;peak in vain. I felt that I had now more e&s;&s;ential duties to fulfil than tho&s;e of love; but the cares with which my mind was occupied, were hardly able to alleviate my grief. I will even avow to you, without blu&s;hing, that the &s;orrow of my &s;i&s;ters, their tender friend&s;hip, and the care&s;&s;es more re&s;erved but no le&s;s plea&s;ing of my mi&s;tre&s;s, made a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on my heart than the patriotic coun&s;els of Pula&s;ki. I beheld Lodoi&s;ka tenderly affected with my irre|parable lo&s;s, and as much afflicted as my|&s;elf at the cruel events which forced us to defer our union; my chagrin, by be|ing thus divided with that lovely woman, &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ibly to dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>In the mean time the king dies, and the Diet is convoked. On the day that it was to open, at the very in&s;tant when I was about to repair to the a&s;&s;embly, a &s;tranger pre&s;ented him&s;elf, and de&s;ired to &s;peak to me in private. As &s;oon as my
<PB N="16" REF="037849_0009_100F849892FBAA38">
attendants were retired, he enters my apartment with precipitation, throws him|&s;elf into my arms, and tenderly embraces me. It was M. de P&mdash;! Ten years, which had elap&s;ed &s;ince our &s;eparation, had not &s;o much changed his features as to prevent me from recognizing him, and te&s;tifying my joy and &s;urpri&s;e at his un|expected return.</P>
<P>"You will be more a&s;toni&s;hed," &s;ays he to me, "when you know the ca&s;e. I have arrived this in&s;tant, and am about to repair to the meeting of the Diet; would it be pre&s;uming too much on your friend&s;hip to reckon on your vote?"</P>
<P>"On my vote! and for whom?"</P>
<P>"For my&s;elf," continues he with vi|vacity; "it is not now time to recount to you the happy revolution that has ta|ken place in my fortune, and which at pre&s;ent permits me to entertain &s;uch ex|alted hopes: it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that my ambition is at lea&s;t ju&s;tified by a majority of &s;uffrages, and that it is in vain that two feeble rivals would attempt to di&s;pute with me the crown which I pretend.</P>
<P>"Lovzin&s;ki," adds he, embracing me again, "if you were not my friend, and I e&s;teemed you le&s;s, perhaps I &s;hould en|deavour

<P>"I behold it with grief, and you know it as well as my&s;elf, that for &s;everal years pa&s;t our Poland, become enfeebled, owes its &s;afety to nothing el&s;e than the di&s;tru&s;t of the three great powers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;&s;ia, Pru&s;&s;ia, and the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</NOTE> which &s;ur|round it, and the de&s;ire to enrich them|&s;elves with our &s;poils, may in one moment re-unite our divided enemies.</P>
<P>"Let us prevent, if we can, this inau|&s;picious triumvirate from di&s;membering the republic. Undoubtedly, in more fortunate times, our ance&s;tors were able to maintain the freedom of their elec|tions; it is nece&s;&s;ary however that we &s;hould yield to that nece&s;&s;ity, which is become inevitable.</P>
<P>"Ru&s;&s;ia will nece&s;&s;arily protect a king, whom &s;he her&s;elf has elevated; in receiv|ing

<P>"The&s;e are the rea&s;ons which have determined my conduct; I do not aban|don part of our rights, but to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t precious of them.

<P>We repaired to the Diet together; I voted for M. de P&mdash;. He in effect obtained the majority of the &s;uffrages; but Pula&s;ki, Zuremba, and &s;ome others, declared them&s;elves in favour of Prince C&mdash;. Nothing was decided amid&s;t the tumult of this fir&s;t meeting.</P>
<P>When the a&s;&s;embly broke up M. de P&mdash; invited me to accompany him to the place, which his &s;ecret emi&s;&s;aries had already prepared for him in the capital.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Diet for the election of the kings of Po|land is held half a league from War&s;aw, in the open air, on the other &s;ide of the Vi&s;tula, near the village of Vola.</NOTE>
<PB N="19" REF="037849_0010_100F849A7037DF40">
We &s;hut our&s;elves up together during &s;everal hours, and renewed the promi&s;es of a friend&s;hip that &s;hould endure forever. I then too informed M. de P&mdash; of my intimate connection with Pula&s;ki, and of my love for Lodoi&s;ka. He repaid my confidence with more important commu|nications; he informed me of the events which had led to his approaching gran|deur; he explained to me his &s;ecret de|&s;igns; and I left him, convinced that he was le&s;s occupied with a de&s;ire of his own elevation, than with that of re&s;toring Po|land to its ancient pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the&s;e ideas, I flew to|wards my future father-in-law, burning with the de&s;ire of adding him to the par|ty of my friend. Pula&s;ki was walking at a great pace up and down the chamber of his daughter, who appeared equally agita|ted with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Behold," &s;aid he to Lodoi&s;ka, the moment that he &s;aw me enter, "behold that man whom I e&s;teem and whom you love! He has &s;acrificed us both to his blind friend&s;hip."

with his de&s;igns; this very morning at the Diet, you voted for him; you have deceived me:&mdash;but do you think that you &s;hall deceive me with impunity?"</P>
<P>I be&s;ought him to hear me, and he con&s;trained him&s;elf &s;o far as to pre&s;erve a &s;tern &s;ilence: I then informed him that M. de P&mdash;, whom I had for a long time neglected, had agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed me by his unexpected return.</P>
<P>Lodoi&s;ka appeared charmed to hear me commence my ju&s;tification.&mdash;"You &s;hall not deceive me in the &s;ame manner as if I were a credulous woman," &s;ays Pula&s;ki.&mdash;"But it &s;ignifies not&mdash;pro|ceed.</P>
<P>I then recounted to him the particu|lars of the &s;hort conver&s;ations that I had with M. de P&mdash; before I repaired to the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>"And the&s;e are your projects!" ex|claims he. "M. de P&mdash; &s;ees no other remedy for the misfortune of his fellow-citizens than their &s;lavery! He propo&s;es this, one of the name of Lovzin&s;ki, ap|proves of it; and they de&s;pi&s;e me &s;o much as to tempt me to enter into this infamous plot! Shall I behold the Ru&s;&s;ians com|manding in our provinces in the name of a Pole?"</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="037849_0011_100F849C4BAE3048">"The Ru&s;&s;ians, &s;ay I with fury; the Ru&s;&s;ians reign in my country!" On this Pula&s;ki, advancing towards me with the greate&s;t impetuo&s;ity, cries out: "Perfid|ious youth! you have deceived me, and you would betray the &s;tate! Leave my hou&s;e this very moment, or know that I &s;hall order you to be dragged out of it!"</P>
<P>I frankly acknowledge that an affront &s;o cruel, and &s;o little merited, di&s;armed me of my prudence: in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of my fury, I placed my hand upon my &s;word; and quicker than lightning Pula&s;|ki brandi&s;hed his in the air.</P>
<P>His daughter, his di&s;tracted daughter, ru&s;hed forward, and precipitated her&s;elf upon me, crying out: "Lovzin&s;ki, what are you about to do?" On hearing the accents of a voice &s;o dear to me, I recal|led my wandering rea&s;on; but I percei|ved that a &s;ingle in&s;tant was about fore|ver to bereave me of my Lodoi&s;ka! She had left me to throw her&s;elf into the arms of her father. He, cruel man, beheld my grief, and &s;trove to augment it: "Go, traitor!" &s;ays he, "be gone&mdash;you be|hold Lodoi&s;ka for the la&s;t time!"</P>
<P>I returned home in a &s;tate of de&s;pera|tion. The odious names which Pula&s;|ki
<PB N="22" REF="037849_0012_100F849F69DDC9E8">
had lavi&s;hed on me, returned uncea|&s;ingly to my reflection. The intere&s;ts of Poland, and tho&s;e of M. de P&mdash;, ap|peared to be &s;o intimately connected to|gether, that I did not perceive in what manner I could betray my fellow-citizens by &s;erving my friend; in the mean time I was obliged either to abandon him, or re|nounce Lodoi&s;ka forever. What was I to re&s;olve? what part &s;hould I take? I pa&s;&s;ed the whole night in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t cruel uncertainty: and when the day appeared, I went towards Pula&s;ki's hou&s;e, without yet having come to any determination.</P>
<P>The only dome&s;tic who remained there informed me, that his lord had de|parted at the beginning of the night, with his daughter, after having fir&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all his people. Think of my de&s;pair on hearing this news. I a&s;ked to what part Pula&s;ki had retired. But my que&s;tion was in vain, he informed me that he was certainly ignorant of the place of his de&s;tination.</P>
<P>"All I can tell you," &s;ays he, "is that you had &s;carce gone away ye&s;terday evening, when he heard a great noi&s;e in the apartment of his daughter. Still ter|rified at the &s;cene which had taken place

between you, I approached the door, and li&s;tened. Lodoi&s;ka wept: her furious father overwhelmed her with injuries, be|&s;towed his malediction upon her, and I my&s;elf heard him exclaim: "To love a traitor, is to be one! Ungrateful wretch! I &s;hall conduct you to a place of &s;afety, where you &s;hall henceforth be at a di&s;|tance from &s;eduction."</P>
<P>Could I any longer doubt the extent of my mi&s;ery? I in&s;tantly called for Bo|le&s;las, one of the mo&s;t faithful of my do|me&s;tics: I ordered him to place tru&s;ty &s;pies about the palace of Pula&s;ki, who &s;hould bring an account of every thing that pa&s;&s;ed there; and commanded that if the count returned to the capital before me, he &s;hould follow him wherever he went. Having given the&s;e in&s;tructions, and not yet de&s;pairing of &s;till finding the family at one of their &s;eats in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, I my&s;elf &s;et out in pur|&s;uit of my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I accordingly &s;earched through all the domains of Pula&s;ki, and a&s;ked concern|ing Lodoi&s;ka of all the pa&s;&s;engers whom I met, but without &s;ucce&s;s. After hav|ing &s;pent eight days in fruitle&s;s enquiry, I re&s;olved to return to War&s;aw, and I was not a little a&s;toni&s;hed, on my arrival, to
<PB N="24" REF="037849_0013_100F84A0FA9DFB40">
find a Ru&s;&s;ian army encamped on the banks of the Vi&s;tula, almo&s;t under the very walls of that city.</P>
<P>It was night when I entered the capi|tal: the palaces of the grandees were all illuminated, an immen&s;e multitude filled the &s;treets; I heard the &s;ongs of joy; I beheld wine flowing in rivulets in the public &s;quares: every thing announced to me that Poland had a king.</P>
<P>Bole&s;las, who expected me with im|patience, informed me that Pula&s;ki had returned alone on the &s;econd day after my departure; and that he had not &s;tirred from his own palace but to repair to the Diet, where, in &s;pite of his efforts, the a&s;|cendancy of Ru&s;&s;ia became every day more manife&s;t. "During the la&s;t a&s;&s;em|bly held this very morning," adds he, M. de P&mdash; united almo&s;t all the &s;uf|frages in his favor, and was about to be declared king, when Pula&s;ki pronounced the fatal <HI>Veto:</HI> at that in&s;tant twenty &s;a|bres were brandi&s;hed in the air. The fierce palatine of &mdash;, whom the count had in&s;ulted in the former a&s;&s;embly, was the fir&s;t to ru&s;h forwards, and gave him a ter|rible wound on the head. Zaremba, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome others, drew to the defence of their friend: but all their efforts would have
<PB N="25" REF="037849_0013_100F84A0FA9DFB40">
been unable to have &s;aved him, if M. de P&mdash; had not ranged him&s;elf on their &s;ide, exclaiming at the &s;ame time, that he would &s;acrifice with his own hand, the fir&s;t per&s;on who dared to approach him. On this the a&s;&s;ailants retired. In the mean time Pula&s;ki, fainting with the lo&s;s of blood, was carried off the field in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. Zaremba departed al&s;o, &s;wearing to avenge his friend. Having thus become ma&s;ter of the deliberations, the numerous partizans of M. de P&mdash; in&s;tantly proclaimed him &s;overeign.</P>
<P>"Pula&s;ki, who had been carried to his palace, was &s;oon re&s;tored to life; and the &s;urgeons who attended him, declared that his wounds, although dangerous, were not mortal. In that &s;tate, although lan|gui&s;hing under the mo&s;t cruel torments, contrary to the advice of all his friends, he ordered him&s;elf to be lifted into his carriage, and before noon he left War&s;aw, accompanied by Mazeppa and a few male-contents."</P>
<P>It was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to have announ|ced wor&s;e news to me. My friend was upon the throne, but my reconciliation with Pula&s;ki appeared henceforth impo&s;|&s;ible, and in all appearance Lodoi&s;ka was lo&s;t forever. I knew her father &s;o well
<PB N="26" REF="037849_0014_100F84A688996698">
as to be under apprehen&s;ions le&s;t he &s;hould proceed to extremities with his daughter. I was affrightened at the pre&s;ent, I dur&s;t not look forward towards the future; and my heart was &s;o devoured with cha|grin, that I did not go out, even to felici|tate the new king.</P>
<P>One of my people, whom Bole&s;las di&s;|patched after Pula&s;ki, returned at the end of the fourth day: He had followed him fifteen leagues from the capital; when a|bout that di&s;tance, Zaremba, who percei|ved a &s;tranger at a little di&s;tance from the carriage, began to conceive &s;u&s;picions. As they proceeded, four of his followers, who had concealed them&s;elves behind the ruins of an old hou&s;e, &s;urpri&s;ed my courier, and conducted him to Pula&s;ki. He, with a pi&s;tol in his hand, forced him to acknowledge to whom he belonged. "I &s;hall &s;end you back to Lovzin&s;ki," &s;aid the fierce republican, "on purpo&s;e to announce from me, that he &s;hall not e&s;|cape my ju&s;t vengeance." At the&s;e words they blindfolded my &s;ervant, who could not tell where they carried him. At the end of four-and-twenty hours they returned, and tying a handkerchief once more about his eyes they put him into a carriage, which having &s;topped at length,
<PB N="27" REF="037849_0014_100F84A688996698">
after a journey of &s;everal hours, he was ordered to de&s;cend. Scarce had he put his foot upon the ground but his guards departed at a full gallop: on which he removed the bandage, and found him&s;elf preci&s;ely on the &s;ame &s;pot as that on which he had been fir&s;t arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>This intelligence filled me with unea&s;i|ne&s;s; the menaces of Pula&s;ki terrified me, much le&s;s on my own account than on Lodoi&s;ka's, who remained in his power: In the mid&s;t of his fury he might &s;acrifice her life! I re&s;olved therefore to expo&s;e my&s;elf to every &s;pecies of danger, on pur|po&s;e to di&s;cover the retreat of the father, and the pri&s;on of his only child.</P>
<P>On the &s;ucceeding day, after informing my &s;i&s;ters of my de&s;ign, I left the capital: Bole&s;las alone accompanied me, and I pa&s;&s;ed for his brother. We wandered over all Poland, and I then percieved that the fears of Pula&s;ki were but too well ju&s;tified by the event. Under pre|tence of obliging the inhabitants to take the oath of fidelity to the new king, the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;cattered about in the pro|vinces, de&s;olated the country, and com|mitted a multitude of exactions in the cities.</P>
<P>After having &s;pent three months in
<PB N="28" REF="037849_0015_100F84A8314914A8">
vain enquiries, de&s;pairing of being able to find Lodoi&s;ka, touched with the mo&s;t lively grief for the fate of my country, and weeping at one and the &s;ame time for her misfortunes and my own, I was about to return to War&s;aw, to inform the new king of the exce&s;&s;es committed by tho&s;e foreigners in his &s;tates, when an ad|venture that at fir&s;t &s;eemed to be very in|au&s;picious, forced me to a very different re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The Turks having declared war again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia, the Tartars of Budziac and the Crimea made frequent incur&s;ions into Volhynia, where I then was. Four of tho&s;e robbers attacked us one afternoon, as we were leaving a wood near O&s;tro|pol. I had imprudently neglected to load my pi&s;tols; but I made u&s;e of my &s;abre with &s;o much addre&s;s and good luck, that in a &s;hort time, two of them fell cov|ered with wounds. Bole&s;las encountered the third: the fourth attacked me with great fury; he gave me a &s;light cut upon the leg, but received a terrible &s;troke in return, that di&s;mounted him from his hor&s;e and felled him to the ground. Bo|le&s;las at the &s;ame moment perceived him|&s;elf di&s;encumbered from his enemy, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the noi&s;e made by his comrade's fall

took to flight. He whom I had ju&s;t van|qui&s;hed, then addre&s;&s;ed me in very bad Poli&s;h, and &s;aid, "a brave man like you ought to be generous. I beg my life of you; in&s;tead of putting me to death, &s;uc|cour me, relieve me, bind up my wounds and a&s;&s;i&s;t me to ari&s;e."</P>
<P>He demanded quarter with an air &s;o noble, that I did not he&s;itate for a mo|ment. I accordingly de&s;cended from my hor&s;e, and Bole&s;las and my&s;elf hav|ing helped him to ari&s;e, we dre&s;&s;ed his wounds. "You behave well:" &s;ays the Tartar to me; "you behave well!" As he &s;poke we beheld a cloud of du&s;t, and in a moment after, more than three hundred Tartars ru&s;hed upon us full &s;peed. "Be not afraid, dread nothing," &s;ays he whom I had &s;pared; "I am the chief of this troop." Accordingly, by means of a &s;ign, he &s;tops his followers, who were on the point of ma&s;&s;acring us; and &s;peaking to them in their own lan|guage, which I was unable to compre|hend, they in&s;tantly opened their ranks on purpo&s;e to permit us to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>"Brave man," exclaims their captain, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me once more, "had I not rea&s;on to &s;ay you behaved well? You left me my life, and I now &s;ave

I therefore &s;aid to Bole&s;las; "Let us immediately make for the ca&s;tle that he has now pointed out to us; I am well acquainted with this &s;ame Dourlin|&s;ki by name; Pula&s;ki has &s;ometimes &s;po|ken to to me concerning him: he per|haps is not ignorant of the place to which the Count has retired; and it is not im|po&s;&s;ible but that with a little addre&s;s we may be able to draw the &s;ecret from him.

opportunity of looking at my wound, which was found to be but &s;uperficial.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> frugal repa&s;t was &s;erved up for us in the kitchen. We were afterwards conducted to a lower chamber, where two beds were prepared for us. The dome&s;tics then left us with|out any light, and immediately locked the door of the apartment.</P>
<P>I could not clo&s;e my eyes during the whole of the night.

<P>After having walked about for a few minutes, I &s;at down on a &s;tone bench, which was placed at the foot of a tower, who&s;e ancient architecture I had been &s;ome time con&s;idering. I remained for a few &s;econds enveloped in reflection, when a tile fell at my feet. I thought it had dropped from the roof of this old

building; and to avoid the effects of a &s;imilar accident, I went and placed my|&s;elf at the other end of the &s;eat. A few moments after, a &s;econd tile fell by my &s;ide. The circum&s;tance appeared &s;ur|pri&s;ing: I aro&s;e with &s;ome degree of in|quietude, and attentively examined the tower. I perceived at about twenty-five or thirty feet from the ground, a narrow opening. On this I picked up the tiles which had been thrown at me, and on the fir&s;t I di&s;covered the following words, written with a bit of plai&s;ter:</P>
<P>"LOVZINSKI, IS IT YOU! DO YOU STILL LIVE!"</P>
<P>And on the &s;econd the&s;e:</P>
<P>"DELIVER ME! SAVE LODOISKA."</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how many different &s;entiments occupied my mind at one and the &s;ame time: my a&s;toni&s;hment, my joy, my grief, my embarra&s;&s;ment, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. I examined once more the pri&s;on of Lodoi&s;ka, and plotted in my own mind how I could pro|cure her liberty. She at length threw down another tile, and I read as follows:</P>
<P>"At midnight, bring me paper, ink, and pens; and to-morrow an hour after &s;un-ri&s;e, come and receive a letter.&mdash; Begone."&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="037849_0018_100F84B3401A5630">Having returned towards my chamber, I called to Bole&s;las, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in re-entering through the window. I then informed my faithful &s;ervant, of the unex|pected accident that had put an end to my wanderings and redoubled my inqui|etude.</P>
<P>How could I penetrate into this tow|er? How could we procure arms? By what means were we to deliver Lo|doi&s;ka from captivity? How could we carry her off under the eye of Dourlin&s;ki, in the mid&s;t of his people, from a fortifi|ed ca&s;tle? and &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;o many ob&s;tacles were not un&s;urmountable, could I attempt &s;uch an enterprize during the &s;hort delay pre&s;cribed by Tit&s;ican?</P>
<P>Did not the Tartar enjoin me to &s;tay with Dourlin&s;ki three days, but not to remain longer than eight?</P>
<P>Would it not be to expo&s;e our&s;elves to the attacks of the enemy, to leave this ca&s;tle before the third, or after the expi|ration of the eighth day? Should I re|lea&s;e my dear Lodoi&s;ka from a pri&s;on, on purpo&s;e to deliver her into the hands of robbers, to be forever &s;eparated from her either by &s;lavery or death? This would be a horrible idea!</P>
<P>But wherefore was &s;he confined in &s;uch

a frightful pri&s;on? The letter which &s;he had promi&s;ed would doubtle&s;s in&s;truct me: It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to pro|cure paper, pen and ink.

<P>It was broad day light when they came to &s;et us at liberty, and informed us that Dourlin&s;ki was at lei&s;ure and wi&s;hed to &s;ee us.

He demanded who we were. "My bro|ther and my&s;elf," replied I, "belong to Count Pula&s;ki. My ma&s;ter has entru&s;ted me with a &s;ecret commi&s;&s;ion to you. My brother accompanies me on another ac|count. Before I explain, I mu&s;t be in private, for I am charged not to &s;peak but to you alone."</P>
<P>"It is very well," replies Dourlin&s;ki&punc; "your brother may retire, and you al&s;o," addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his &s;ervants; "be|gone! As to him (pointing to a per&s;on who was his confident) he mu&s;t remain, and you may &s;peak any thing before him."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="037849_0019_100F79A1D0B5F828">"Pula&s;ki has &s;ent me,"&mdash;"I &s;ee very well that he has &s;ent you," &s;ays the Palatine, interrupting me&mdash;"to de|mand of you&mdash;" "What?"&mdash; "news of his daughter." "News of his daughter! Did Pula&s;ki &s;ay &s;o?"&mdash; "Yes my lord, he &s;aid that his daughter was here."&mdash;I perceived that Dour|lin&s;ki in&s;tantly grew pale; he then look|ed towards his confident, and &s;urveyed me for &s;ome time in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"You a&s;toni&s;h me," rejoins he at length, "In confiding a &s;ecret of this im|portance to you, it nece&s;&s;arily follows that your ma&s;ter mu&s;t have been very imprudent."</P>
<P>No more than you, my lord, for have not you al&s;o a confident: Grandees would be much to be pitied if they could not rely upon any of their dome&s;tics. Pu|la&s;ki has charged me to inform you, that Lovzin&s;ki has already &s;earched through a great part of Poland, and that he will undoubtedly vi&s;it the&s;e cantons."</P>
<P>"If he dares to come here," replies he with great vivacity, "I will provide a lodging for him, which he &s;hall inhabit for &s;ome time. Do you know this Lov|zin&s;ki?"</P>
<P>"I have &s;een him at my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e in War&s;aw."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="037849_0019_100F79A1D0B5F828">"They &s;ay he is hand&s;ome?"</P>
<P>"He is well made, and about my &s;ize."</P>
<P>"His per&s;on?"&mdash;"is prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; it is&mdash;"</P>
<P>"He is a wretch," adds he, interrup|ting me in a great pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;"Oh that he were but to fall into my hands!"</P>
<P>"My lord, they &s;ay he is brave&mdash;".</P>
<P>"He! I will lay any wager, any &s;um of money, that he is only calculated to &s;e|duce women! O that he would but fall into my hands!" Then a&s;&s;uming a le&s;s ferocious tone, he continues thus, "It is a long time &s;ince Pula&s;ki wrote to me&mdash; where is he at pre&s;ent?"</P>
<P>"My lord I have preci&s;e orders not to an&s;wer that que&s;tion: all that I dare to &s;ay, is, that he has the &s;tronge&s;t rea|&s;ons for neither di&s;covering the place of his retreat, nor writing to any per&s;on, and that he will &s;oon come and explain them to you in per&s;on."</P>
<P>Dourlin&s;ki appeared exceedingly a&s;|toni&s;hed at this information; I could di&s;cover &s;ome &s;ymptoms of fear in his countenance. At length, looking at his confident, who &s;eemed equally embarra&s;|&s;ed with him&s;elf, he proceeded: "You &s;ay that Pula&s;ki will come here &s;oon:" "Yes, my lord, in about a fortnight, or a little

later." On this he again turned to his attendant; but in a &s;hort time affecting as much calmne&s;s as he had before di&s;|covered embarra&s;&s;ment; "Return to your ma&s;ter." added he; "I am &s;orry to have nothing but bad news to communi|cate to him&mdash;tell him that Lodoi|&s;ka is no longer here." I my&s;elf became &s;urpri&s;ed in my turn at this information. "What! my lord, Lodoi&s;ka&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Is not longer here, I tell you!&mdash; To oblige Pula&s;ki, whom I e&s;teem, I un|dertook, although with great repugnance, the ta&s;k of confining his daughter in my ca&s;tle: nobody but my&s;elf and he (point|ing to his confident) knew that &s;he was here. It is about a month &s;ince we went, as u&s;eful, to carry her provi&s;ions for the day, but there was nobody in the apart|ment. I am ignorant how it happened; but what I know well is, that &s;he has e&s;|caped, for I have heard nothing of her &s;ince.&mdash;She mu&s;t undoubtedly have gone to join Lovzin&s;ki at War&s;aw, if perchance the Tartars have not intercepted her in her journey."</P>
<P>My a&s;toni&s;hment on this became ex|treme. How could I reconcile that which I had &s;een in the garden, with that which Dourlin&s;ki now told me? There
<PB N="39" REF="037849_0020_100F84B7A3D5D7E8">
was &s;ome my&s;tery in this bu&s;ine&s;s, which I became exceedingly impatient to be acquainted with: I was however ex|tremely careful not to exhibit any appear|ance of doubt. "My lord, &s;aid I, "this is bad news for my ma&s;ter!"&mdash; "Undoubtedly, but it is not my fault."</P>
<P>"My lord, I have a favour to a&s;k of you."</P>
<P>"Let me hear it."&mdash;"The Tar|tars are ravaging the neighbourhood of your ca&s;tle&mdash;they attacked us&mdash; we e&s;caped as it were by a miracle. Will you permit my brother and my&s;elf to re|main here only for the &s;pace of two days?"</P>
<P>"For two days only I give my con|&s;ent,"</P>
<P>"Where do they lodge?" &s;ays he to his attendant. "in an apartment below ground," was the reply.</P>
<P>"Which overlooks my gardens?" re|joins Dourlin&s;ki, interrupting him with great agitation.</P>
<P>"The &s;hutters are well fa&s;tened," adds the other.</P>
<P>"No matter&mdash; You mu&s;t put them el&s;ewhere." The&s;e words made me tremble.</P>
<P>"It is not impo&s;&s;ible, but,"&mdash; continues the confident, and then whi&s;|pered
<PB N="40" REF="037849_0021_100F84BA371793A0">
the re&s;t of the &s;entence in his ear.</P>
<P>"Right," &s;ays the Baron; "and let it be done in&s;tantly." Then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, know that your brother and you mu&s;t depart the day after to|morrow: before you go, you &s;hall &s;ee me again, and I will give you a letter for Pula&s;ki."</P>
<P>I then went to rejoin Bole&s;las in the kitchen, where he was at breakfa&s;t, who &s;oon after pre&s;ented me with a little bot|tle of ink, &s;everal pens, and &s;ome &s;heets of paper, which he had procured without difficulty. I panted with de&s;ire to write to Lodoi&s;ka; and the only difficulty that now remained, was to find a commodi|ous place where I might not be di&s;cover|ed by the curio&s;ity of Dourlin&s;ki's people.</P>
<P>They had already informed Bole&s;las that we could not again be admitted into the apartment where we had &s;pent the preceding night, until the time &s;hould arrive when we were to retire to re&s;t. I &s;oon, however, bethought my&s;elf of a &s;tratagem which &s;ucceeded to admira|tion.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants were drinking with my pretended brother, and politely invited me to help them to empty a few fla&s;ks.</P>
<P>I &s;wallowed, with a good grace, &s;ever|al
<PB N="41" REF="037849_0021_100F84BA371793A0">
gla&s;&s;es of bad wine in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: in a few minutes my legs &s;eemed to totter, my tongue faultered: I related a hundred plea&s;ant and improbable tales to the joy|ous company; in a word, I acted the drunken man &s;o well, that Bole&s;las him|&s;elf became a dupe to my &s;cheme, and actually trembled le&s;t, in a moment when I &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to communicate every thing, my &s;ecret &s;hould e&s;cape.</P>
<P>"Gentlemen," &s;aid he, to the a&s;toni&s;h|ed Bacchanals, "my brother's head is not very &s;trong to day: it is perhaps in con|&s;equence of his wound; let us not there|fore either &s;peak to or drink any more with him; for I am afraid of his health, and indeed you would oblige me exceed|ingly if you would a&s;&s;i&s;t me to carry him to his bed,"&mdash;"To his own bed?" &s;ays one of them: "that is impo&s;&s;ible! But I will mo&s;t willingly lend him my chamber." They accordingly laid hold of me, and conveyed me into a garret, of which a bed, a table, and a chair formed the &s;ole moveables. Having &s;hut me up in this paltry apartment, they in&s;tantly left me. This was all I wanted, for the moment that I was alone, I immediately &s;at down to write a long letter to Lo|doi&s;ka.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="037849_0022_100F84BE1F973C08">I began by fully ju&s;tifying my&s;elf from the crimes of which I had been accu&s;ed by Pula&s;ki: I then recounted every thing that had occurred &s;ince the fir&s;t moment of our &s;eparation, until that when I had entered the ca&s;tle of Dourlin&s;ki: I detail|ed the particulars of my conver&s;ation with the Baron: I concluded by a&s;&s;uring her of the mo&s;t tender and the mo&s;t re&s;|pectful pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;wore to her, that the moment &s;he gave me the nece&s;&s;ary inform|ation concerning her &s;ituation, I would expo&s;e my&s;elf to every danger, in order to fini&s;h her horrid captivity.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my letter was &s;ealed, I de|livered my&s;elf up to a variety of reflec|tions, which threw me into a &s;trange per|plexity. Was it actually Lodoi&s;ka who had thrown tho&s;e tiles into the garden? Would Pula&s;ki have had the inju&s;tice to puni&s;h his daughter for an attachment which he him&s;elf had approved? Would he have had the inhumanity to plunge her into a frightful pri&s;on? And even if the hatred he had &s;worn to me had blind|ed him &s;o much, how was it po&s;&s;ible that Dourlin&s;ki would thus have conde&s;cended to have become the mini&s;ter of his ven|geance?</P>
<P>But, on the other hand, for the&s;e three

la&s;t long months, on purpo&s;e to di&s;gui&s;e my&s;elf, I had only worn tattered clothes: the fatigues of a tedious journey, and my chagrin, had altered me greatly; and who but a mi&s;tre&s;s could have been able to di&s;cover Lovzin&s;ki in the gardens of Dourlin&s;ki? Be&s;ides, had I not &s;een the name of Lodoi&s;ka traced upon the tile? Had not Dourlin&s;ki him&s;elf acknowledg|ed that Lodoi&s;ka had been a pri&s;oner with him? It is true, he had added that &s;he had made her e&s;cape: but was not this incredible? And wherefore that ha|tred which Dourlin&s;ki had avowed a|gain&s;t me, without knowing my per&s;on? What occa&s;ioned that look of inquietude, when it was told him, that the emi&s;&s;aries of Pula&s;ki occupied a chamber that look|ed into his garden? And why above all that look of terror, when I announced to him the arrival of my pretended ma&s;ter?</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances were well cal|culated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow me into the greate&s;t agi|tation.

from my debauch. I had but little difficulty in convincing him that my inebriety was mere affectation; after which we went down together to the kitchen, where we &s;pent the re&s;t of the day. What a night! none in my whole life ever appeared &s;o long, not even that which followed.</P>
<P>At length the attendants conducted us to our chamber, where they &s;hut us up, as on the former occa&s;ion, without any light: it was yet two tedious hours until midnight. At the fir&s;t &s;troke of the clock, we gently opened the &s;hutters and the ca&s;ement. I then prepared to jump into the garden; but my embarra&s;&s;ment was equal to my de&s;pair, when I found my&s;elf ob&s;tructed by means of iron bars. "Be|hold," &s;aid I to Bole&s;las, "what the cur|&s;ed confident whi&s;pered in his ear! be|hold what his odious ma&s;ter approved, when he &s;aid, <HI>let it be done in&s;tantly!</HI> behold what they have been working at during the day! it was on this account that they prevented us from entering the chamber."</P>
<P>"My lord, they have &s;tood on the out&s;ide," replies Bole&s;las: "for they have not perceived that the &s;hutter has been forced."</P>
<P>"Alas! whether they have perceiv|ed

<P>"Yes without doubt it in&s;ures thy death!" repeats a per&s;on, at the &s;ame time opening the door: and immediately after, Dourlin&s;ki, preceded by &s;everal armed men, and followed by others car|rying flambeaux, enter our pri&s;on <HI>&s;abre in hand.</HI> "Traitor!" exclaims he, while addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me with a look in which fury was vi&s;ibly depicted, "I have heard all&mdash;I know who you are&mdash;your &s;ervant has di&s;covered your name. Trem|ble! Of all the enemies of Lovzin&s;ki, I am the mo&s;t implacable!"</P>
<P>"Search them continues he, turning to his attendants: they accordingly ru&s;h|ed in upon me; and as I was without arms, I made a u&s;ele&s;s re&s;i&s;tance. They accordingly robbed me of my papers, and of the letter I had ju&s;t written to Lodo|i&s;ka. Dourlin&s;ki exhibited a thou&s;and &s;igns of impatience while reading it, and was &s;carce able to contain him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Lovzin&s;ki," &s;ays he to me, endeav|ouring to &s;mother his rage, "I already de&s;erve all your hatred; I &s;hall &s;oon merit it &s;till more: in the mean time
<PB N="46" REF="037849_0024_100F84C3B4AA8B40">
you mu&s;t remain with your worthy con|fident in this chamber, to which you are &s;o partial."</P>
<P>After uttering the&s;e words, he left me; and having double-locked the door, he placed a centinel on the out&s;ide, and another in the garden, oppo&s;ite to the window.</P>
<P>Figure to your&s;elf the horrible &s;ituation into which Bole&s;las and my&s;elf were now plunged. My misfortunes were at their height; but tho&s;e of Lodoi&s;ka affected me more than my own! How great mu&s;t be her unea&s;ine&s;s! She expects Lovzin|&s;ki, and Lovzin&s;ki abandons her! But no&mdash;Lodoi&s;ka knows me too well; &s;he can never &s;u&s;pect me of &s;uch ba&s;e perfidy. Lodoi&s;ka! &s;he will judge of her lover by her&s;elf; &s;he will think Lovzin&s;ki par|takes her lot, &s;ince he does not &s;uccour her&mdash; Alas! the very certainty of my misfortunes will augment her own!</P>
<P>On the next day, they gave us provi|&s;ions through the grating of our window; and by the quality of the viands which they furni&s;hed us with, Bole&s;las augured the mo&s;t &s;ini&s;ter events. Being however le&s;s unhappy than my&s;elf, he &s;upported his fate much more courageou&s;ly. He offered me my &s;hare of the mean repa&s;t
<PB N="47" REF="037849_0024_100F84C3B4AA8B40">
which he was about to make; I would not eat: he pre&s;&s;ed me; but it was in vain! for exi&s;tence was become an in|&s;upportable burden to me.</P>
<P>"Ah! live!" &s;aid he at length, &s;hed|ding a torrent of tears: live! and if not for Bole&s;las, let it be for Lodoi&s;ka! The&s;e words made the mo&s;t lively im|pre&s;&s;ion on my mind; they even reani|mated my courage: and hope having once more re-entered my heart, I embra|ced my faithful &s;ervant. "O my friend!" exclaimed I at the &s;ame time with tran&s;|port, "my true friend! I have been the occa&s;ion of thy ruin, and yet my misfor|tunes affect thee more than thine own! Yes, Bole&s;las! yes! I will live for Lo|doi&s;ka; I will live for thee: if ju&s;t hea|ven &s;hall re&s;tore me to my fortune and rank, you &s;hall &s;ee that your ma&s;ter is not ungrateful!" We now embraced once more.</P>
<P>Ah! how much do misfortunes con|nect men together! how &s;weet it is, when one &s;uffers, to hear another unfortunate addre&s;s a word of con&s;olation to him!</P>
<P>We had groaned in this pri&s;on for no le&s;s than twelve days, when &s;everal ruf|fians came to drag me forth on purpo&s;e to conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Dourlin&s;ki. Bole&s;las
<PB N="48" REF="037849_0025_100F84C77348E418">
wi&s;hed to follow, but they repul&s;ed him with violence: However they permitted me to &s;peak to him for a &s;ingle moment. I then drew from a private pocket a ring which I had worn for ten years, and &s;aid to Bole&s;las: "This ring was given to me by M. de P. when we were at col|lege together at War&s;aw: take it, my friend; and pre&s;erve it for my &s;ake. If Dourlin&s;ki this day con&s;ummates his trea&s;on by my a&s;&s;ination, and if he &s;hould at length permit you to leave this ca&s;tle, go find your king, recall to his memory our ancient attachment, recount my mis|fortunes to him: he will recompen&s;e you, and &s;uccour Lodoi&s;ka. Adieu my friend!"</P>
<P>After this, I was conducted to the apartment of Dourlin&s;ki. As &s;oon as the door opened, I perceived a lady in a chair, who had ju&s;t fainted away. I ap|proached her&mdash;it was Lodoi&s;ka! Hea|vens! how much did I find her altered! but &s;he was &s;till hand&s;ome! "Barbari|an!" exclaimed I, addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Dourlin&s;ki; and at the voice of her lover, Lodoi&s;ka recovered her &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>"Ah, my dear Lovzin&s;ki," &s;ays &s;he, looking wi&s;tfully at me, "do you know what this infamous wretch has propo&s;ed?
<PB N="49" REF="037849_0025_100F84C77348E418">
do you know at what price he has offered me your liberty?"</P>
<P>"Yes," cries the furious chieftain, "yes, I am determined upon it: you &s;ee that he is in my power; and if in three days I do not obtain my wi&s;hes, he &s;hall be no more!" I endeavored to throw my&s;elf on my knees at the feet of Lo|doi&s;ka; but my guards prevented me: "I behold you again, and all my ills are forgotten, Lodoi&s;ka&mdash;death has now no longer any thing terrifying in its a&s;pect."</P>
<P>"Wretch," added I, looking &s;ternly at Dourlin&s;ki, "know that Pula&s;ki will avenge his daughter! know that the king will avenge his friend!"</P>
<P>"Let him be carried away!" was the only reply made by the ferocious Pal|atine.</P>
<P>"Ah!" exclaimed Lodoi&s;ka, "my love has been your ruin!" I was about to an&s;wer, but the attendants dragged me out, and re-conducted me to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Bole&s;las received me with inexpre&s;&s;ible tran&s;ports of joy; he avowed to me that he thought me lo&s;t for ever, and I re|counted to him that my death was but de|ferred. The &s;cene of which I had been a witne&s;s confirmed all my &s;u&s;picions; it was evident that Pula&s;ki was ignorant
<PB N="50" REF="037849_0026_100F84C910041900">
of the unworthy treatment which his daughter experienced; it was al&s;o evi|dent that Dourlin&s;ki, old, amorous and jealous, was determined, at any rate, to &s;atisfy his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the mean time, two of the days allowed by Dourlin&s;ki for the determina|tion of Lodoi&s;ka, had already expired; we were now in the mid&s;t of the night which preceded the fatal third; I could not &s;leep, and I was walking ha&s;tily about my pri&s;on. All at once I heard the cry of "to arms! to arms!" The mo&s;t frightful howlings prevailed on the out&s;ide, and a great commotion took place within the ca&s;tle. The centinel placed at our window, left his po&s;t. Bo|le&s;las and I were able to di&s;tingui&s;h the voice of Dourlin&s;ki, calling and encoura|ging his followers; and we &s;oon di&s;tinct|ly heard the cla&s;hing of &s;words, the cries of the wounded, and the groans of the dying. The noi&s;e, which at fir&s;t was very great, &s;eemed at length to die away. It recommenced &s;oon after; it redoubled; and at length we heard a &s;hout of "Vic|tory!"</P>
<P>To this frightful tumult, a &s;till more frightful &s;ilence en&s;ues. In a &s;hort time, a low crackling &s;ound is heard to ap|proach

us; the air &s;eems to hi&s;s with violence; the night becomes le&s;s dark&punc; the trees in the garden a&s;&s;ume a red and warm tint; we fly to the window: the flames are devouring the ca&s;tle of Dour|linski! they approach the chamber in which we were confined, from all &s;ides; and, to overwhelm me with new horror, the mo&s;t piercing &s;hrieks are uttered from that tower in which I knew Lodoiska was impri&s;oned!</P>
<P>The fire becoming every moment more violent, was about to communicate to the chamber in which we were &s;hut up, and the flames already began to curl around the ba&s;e of the tower in which Lodoiska was immured!</P>
<P>Lodoiska uttered the mo&s;t dreadful groans, to which I an&s;wered by cries of fury. Bole&s;las ru&s;hed from one part of the pri&s;on to another, like a madman; he &s;ent forth the mo&s;t terrible howlings; he attempted to bur&s;t open the door with his hands and feet. As for my&s;elf, I re|mained at the window, and &s;hook, amid&s;t my tran&s;ports of fury, tho&s;e ma&s;&s;ive iron bars which I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nable to bend.</P>
<P>All of a &s;udden, the dome&s;tics who had lately mounted the battlements, de|&s;cend with precipitation, and open the

<P>By their dre&s;s and their arms, I know them to be Tartars: their chief arrives &mdash;it is Tit&s;ican!</P>

<P>I in&s;tantly throw my&s;elf on his neck: &mdash;"Tit&s;ican!&mdash;Lodoiska!&mdash;a lady!&mdash;the faire&s;t of women!&mdash; in that tower!&mdash;about to be burnt alive!"</P>
<P>The&s;e were the incoherent expre&s;&s;ions by which I made my feelings known.</P>

<P>That which was on the point of de|&s;troying, &s;aved us! The flames, formerly &s;mothered, began to extend with greater rapidity; but the &s;moke was di&s;&s;ipated.

<P>I remained nearly an hour in this &s;itu|ation. They tremble for my life; and Bole&s;las weeps aloud. I again recover my &s;en&s;es, on hearing the voice of Lodo|iska, who returning to her&s;elf, calls me her deliverer. The appearance of every thing was altered; the tower was entire|ly in ruins. The Tartars, however, had &s;topped the progre&s;s of the flames; they had de&s;troyed one part of the ca&s;tle, on purpo&s;e to &s;ave the remainder; in fine, we had been carried into a large &s;aloon, where we were &s;urrounded by Tit&s;ican and &s;ome of his &s;oldiers. Others of them were occupied in pillaging and in bring|ing away the gold, &s;ilver, jewels, plate, and all the precious effects which the flames had &s;pared.</P>

hands again&s;t his forehead, and, uttering the mo&s;t horrible bla&s;phemies, he re|proached heaven for its ju&s;t vengeance.</P>
<P>In the mean time, my lovely mi&s;tre&s;s holds my hand cla&s;ped in hers. "Alas," &s;ays &s;he at length, with tears in her eyes, "alas! you have &s;aved my life, and your own is &s;till in danger! Nay, even if we e&s;cape death, &s;lavery awaits us!"</P>
<P>"No, no, Lodoiska, be comforted, Tit&s;ican is not my enemy; Tit&s;ican will put a period to our misfortunes&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly, if I am able," ex|claims the Tartar, interrupting me: "you are in the right, brave man! (adds he) I &s;ee that you are not dead, and I am happy: you always &s;ay, and do good things; and you have there (turning to Bole&s;las) you have there a friend who &s;econds you admirably."</P>
<P>On this I embrace Bole&s;las:&mdash;"yes, Tit&s;ican, yes, I have a friend, who &s;hall always be dear to me!&mdash;"</P>
<P>The Tartar again interrupts me:&mdash; "What! were not you both confined in an apartment below ground, and was not this lady in a tower? What was the rea|&s;on of that? I will lay any wager con|tinues he with a &s;mile, that you have ta|ken this female from that old wretch,

(pointing to Dourlinski) and you are in the right; for he is a dotard, and &s;he is beautiful! Come&mdash;inform me of every thing."</P>
<P>I now di&s;cover my own name to Tit|&s;ican, that of Lodoiska's father, and ev|ery particular that had occurred to me until that moment. It belongs to Lodo|iska, I ob&s;erve in conclu&s;ion, to make us acquainted with what &s;he has been obli|ged to &s;uffer from the infamous Dourlin|ski, ever &s;ince &s;he has been in his ca&s;tle!</P>
<P>"You know," replies Lodoiska, "that my father obliged me to leave War&s;aw, on the day that the Diet was opened. He fir&s;t conducted me to the territories of the Palatine of&mdash;, at only twen|ty leagues di&s;tance from the capital, to which he returned, on purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the meeting of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>"On that very day when M. de P.&mdash; was proclaimed king, Pulaski took me from the ca&s;tle of the Palatine, and con|ducted me here, thinking that I &s;hould be better concealed. He charged Dour|linski to guard me with, extraordinary &s;trictne&s;s; and, above all things, to take e&s;pecial care to prevent Lovzinski from di&s;covering the place of my retreat. He then left me, as he informed me, on pur|po&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="037849_0029_100F84D3482AD200">
to a&s;&s;emble and encourage the good citizens to defend his country, and to puni&s;h traitors. Alas! the&s;e important avocations have made him forget his daughter, for I have never &s;een him &s;ince.</P>
<P>"A few days after his departure, I began to perceive that the vi&s;its of Dour|linski had become more frequent than u&s;ual; in a &s;hort time, he hardly ever quitted the apartment a&s;&s;igned me for a pri&s;on. He deprived me, under &s;ome trifling pretext, of the only female attend|ant whom my father had left me; and to prevent any per&s;on (as he &s;aid) from knowing that I was in his ca&s;tle, he him|&s;elf brought me the food nece&s;&s;ary for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and pa&s;&s;ed whole days along with me. You cannot conceive, my dear Lovzinski, how much I &s;uffered from the continual pre&s;ence of a man, who was odious to me, and who&s;e infa|mous de&s;igns I was &s;u&s;picious of: he even dared to explain him&s;elf to me one day: but I a&s;&s;ured him that my hate &s;hould al|ways be the price of his tenderne&s;s, and that his unworthy conduct had drawn up|on him my &s;overeign contempt.</P>
<P>"He an&s;wered me coldly, that in time I &s;hould accu&s;tom my&s;elf to &s;ee him, and
<PB N="58" REF="037849_0030_100F84D4D75C1A40">
to &s;uffer his a&s;&s;iduities; nay, he did not in the lea&s;t alter his u&s;ual conduct, for he entered my chamber in the morning, and never retired until night. Separated from all I loved, I had not even the feeble con&s;olation of being able to enjoy the &s;weet recollection of pa&s;t happine&s;s. A witne&s;s to my misfortunes, Dourlinski took plea&s;ure in augmenting them.</P>
<P>"'Pulaski,' &s;ays he to me, 'com|mands a body of Poli&s;h troops; Lovzin|ski betraying his country, which he does not love, and a woman concerning whom he is indifferent, &s;erves in the Ru&s;&s;ian ar|my, where he will be cut off during &s;ome bloody engagement: be&s;ides, if he &s;ur|vives, it is evident that nothing can ever reconcile your father to him.'</P>
<P>"A few days after, he came on pur|po&s;e to announce to me, that Pulaski, during the night, had attacked the Ru&s;|&s;ians in their camp; and that, amid&s;t the confu&s;ion that en&s;ued, my lover had fallen by the hand of my father. The cruel Palatine even made me read a nar|rative of this event, drawn up with every appearance of the truth, in a kind of pub|lic gazette, which doubtle&s;s he had pro|cured to be printed expre&s;sly for the pur|po&s;e: be&s;ides, on perceiving the barba|rous
<PB N="59" REF="037849_0030_100F84D4D75C1A40">
joy which he affected on this occa|&s;ion, I thought the news but too true.</P>
<P>"Pitile&s;s tyrant! cried I, you enjoy my tears and my de&s;pair; but cea&s;e to per&s;ecute me, or you will &s;oon &s;ee that the daughter of Pulaski is her&s;elf able to avenge her own injuries!</P>
<P>"One evening that he had left me &s;ooner than u&s;ual, after I had retired to bed, I heard my door open very &s;oftly. By the light of a lamp, which I kept al|ways burning, I beheld my tyrant advan|cing towards my bed. As there was no crime of which I did not believe him to be capable, I had fore&s;een this event; and I had even taken mea&s;ures to render it un&s;ucce&s;sful. I accordingly armed my&s;elf with a long &s;harp knife, which I had the precaution to conceal beneath my pillow; I overwhelmed the wretch with the reproaches which he &s;o ju&s;tly merited; and I vowed, if he dared to advance, that I would poignard him with my own hand.</P>
<P>"He retired, with &s;urpri&s;e and affright vi&s;ibly delineated on his countenance: 'I am tired,' &s;aid he as he went out, 'with experiencing nothing but &s;corn; and if I were not afraid of being over|heard, you &s;hould &s;oon perceive what a

<P>"He now withdrew. A few mo|ments after, his confident entered with a pi&s;tol in his hand. I mu&s;t however do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that he wept while he announced to me the orders of his lord.</P>
<P>"'Dre&s;s your&s;elf, madam; you mu&s;t in&s;tantly follow me!'&mdash;This was all he was able to &s;ay to me.</P>
<P>"He then conducted me to that very tower, where, without you, I &s;hould this morning have peri&s;hed: he &s;hut me up in that horrible pri&s;on; it was there that I had l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngui&s;hed for more than a month, without fire, without the light of heaven, and almo&s;t without clothes; with bread and water for my food; for my bed a few tru&s;&s;es of &s;traw: this was the de|plorable &s;tate to which the only daughter of a grandee of Poland was reduced!</P>
<P>"You &s;hudder, brave &s;tranger, and yet believe me, when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I do not recount to you any more than a &s;mall part of my &s;ufferings. One thing

however, rendered my mi&s;ery le&s;s in&s;up|portable: I no longer beheld my tyrant.

<P>Tit&s;ican was li&s;tening to the &s;tory of our misfortunes, with which he appeared to be deeply affected, when one of his centinels approached, and &s;ounded an alarm. He immediately left us in great ha&s;te, on purpo&s;e to run to the draw|bridge. We heard a great tumult, and began to pre&s;age &s;ome inau&s;picious event.</P>
<P>While we remained plunged in con|&s;ternation,&mdash;"Lovzinski, Lodoiska, cowardly and perfidious pair!" exclaim|ed Dourlinski, unable to contain his joy, &mdash;"you have hoped to be able to elude my vengeance, and e&s;cape my cha&s;ti&s;e|ment.

<P>"&mdash;They can only revenge you, vil|lain!" cries Bole&s;las, interrupting him in the mid&s;t of his threats, and &s;eizing at the &s;ame time an iron bar, with which he pre|pared to knock him down; I, however, in&s;tantly interpo&s;ed and prevented him from executing this act of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Tit&s;ican returned in a few minutes: "It is only a fal&s;e alarm," &s;aid he to us; "it is nothing more than a &s;mall detach|ment which I di&s;patched ye&s;terday, on purpo&s;e to &s;cour the country&mdash;they had orders to rejoin me here; and they have brought me &s;ome pri&s;oners: every thing is quiet, and the neighbourhood does not appear to be in the lea&s;t commotion."</P>
<P>While Tit&s;ican yet &s;poke to me, a number of unfortunates, who&s;e luckle&s;s fate had delivered them into the hands of the enemy, were dragged before him. We fir&s;t beheld five, who b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> bound, walked by the &s;ide of their conquerors, with a downca&s;t and melancholy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>The &s;ixth now appeared: "O Hea|vens! it is my father!" exclaims Lodo|iska, running at the &s;ame time towards him&mdash;I, too, threw my&s;elf at the feet of Pulaski. "Are you Pulaski?" &s;ays the Tartar chieftain, "'tis well; the event is lucky! Believe me, my friend, it is no more than an hour &s;ince I fir&s;t heard of you.

<P>"Tit&s;ican, &s;uch a thought is not wor|thy of you!" &s;ays Pula&s;ki, interrupting him.</P>

We &s;ent for him; on his arrival he examines the wound, and a&s;&s;ures us that it is but a &s;light one. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">famous Dourlinski, con&s;trained by his chains, and blinded by his de&s;pair, had happily been prevented from giving any other than an ill directed blow.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Tit&s;ican was informed that the life of Lodoiska was not in any danger, he prepared to take leave of us.</P>
<P>"I leave you," &s;aid he, "the five do|me&s;tics who accompanied Pulaski; pro|vi&s;ions for &s;everal days, arms, &s;ix excel|lent hor&s;es, two covered waggons, and the people belonging to Dourlinski in chains.

<P>At the&s;e words he lifts his hand to his head, and having &s;aluted us graceful|ly after the manner of his country, he gives the &s;ignal to depart: the Tartars mount their fleet cour&s;ers in an in&s;tant,

<P>They had been gone &s;carcely two hours, when &s;everal of the neighbouring nobility, &s;upported by a detachment of militia, came on purpo&s;e to inve&s;t the ca&s;tle of Dourlin&s;ki.</P>
<P>Pula&s;ki him&s;elf went out to receive them: he related the particulars of all that had occurred; and &s;ome, gained over by his eloquence, promi&s;ed to follow us to the palatinate of Lublin.</P>
<P>They a&s;ked for only two days to pre|pare every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the expe|dition, and actually came and rejoined us at the appointed time, to the number of &s;ixty.</P>
<P>Lodoi&s;ka having a&s;&s;ured us that &s;he was now able to undergo the fatigues of a journey, we placed her in a commodi|ous carriage, which we had luckily been able to procure for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After having re&s;tored Dourlin&s;ki's people to liberty, we abandon the two co|vered waggons to them, in which Tit&s;i|can, acting with his u&s;ual genero&s;ity, had left part of his immen&s;e booty: this we divided among them in equal proportions.</P>
<P>We arrived, without meeting with any accident, at Polowi&s;k, in the Palatinate
<PB N="77" REF="037849_0039_100F84E661ABF6F0">
of Lublin, this being the place which Pu|la&s;ki had appointed for the general ren|dezvous. The news of his return hav|ing gone abroad, a croud of mal-contents in the &s;pace of le&s;s than a month, flocked to, and increa&s;ed our little army to &s;uch a degree, that we &s;oon found it to a|mount to no le&s;s than 10,000 men.</P>
<P>Lodoi&s;ka entirely cured of her wound, and perfectly recovered from her fatigues, had regained her u&s;ual &s;pirits, and appear|ed in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all her former beauty. Pula&s;ki one day called me into his tent, and &s;poke as follows. "Three thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians have appeared, as you well know, upon the heights above, and at no greater di&s;tance than half a league from us: take, in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing night, three thou&s;and cho&s;en men, and go and cha&s;e the enemy from the advan|tageous po&s;ts which they now occupy. Recollect that on the &s;ucce&s;s of a fir&s;t at|tempt depends almo&s;t always that of the campaign; recollect that you are about to avenge your country's wrongs; recol|lect too, my friend, that to-morrow I &s;hall learn thy victory, and that to-mor|row al&s;o thou &s;halt e&s;pou&s;e Lodoi&s;ka!"</P>
<P>I began my march about ten o'clock. At midnight we &s;urpri&s;ed our enemies in
<PB N="78" REF="037849_0040_100F84EA2745E4E0">
their camp. Never was a defeat more complete: we killed &s;even hundred men; we took nine hundred pri&s;oners; we &s;ei|zed all their cannon, the military che&s;t, and the ammunition.</P>
<P>At break of day Pula&s;ki marched out to join me with the remainder of the troops: he brought Lodoi&s;ka along with him: we were married in Pula&s;ki's tent. All the camp re&s;ounded with &s;ongs of gladne&s;s: valour and beauty were cele|brated in joyous epithalamiums: it &s;eem|ed to be the fe&s;tival of Venus and Mars; and it might be truly &s;aid, that every &s;ol|dier appeared to be impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame &s;entiments as my&s;elf, and that they all partook of my happine&s;s.</P>
<P>After I had given up the fir&s;t days of &s;o dear an union entirely to love, I began to think of recompen&s;ing the heroic fidel|ity of Bole&s;las. My father-in-law pre|&s;ented him with one of his ca&s;tles, &s;itu|ated at &s;ome leagues from the capital; and Lodoi&s;ka and my&s;elf added to this princely donation, a con&s;iderable &s;um of ready money, on purpo&s;e to enable him to lead an independent and tranquil life.</P>
<P>He fir&s;t refu&s;ed to leave us; but we commanded him to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his ca&s;tle, and live peaceably in
<PB N="79" REF="037849_0040_100F84EA2745E4E0">
that honourable retreat which his &s;ervices had &s;o amply merited. On the day of his departure I took him a&s;ide: "You mu&s;t go in my name," &s;aid I, "and wait up|on our monarch at War&s;aw: inform him that I am united in the bonds of Hymen to the daughter of Pula&s;ki: &s;tate to him that I am armed on purpo&s;e to cha&s;e out of his kingdom tho&s;e foreigners who are ravaging it; and tell him, in particular, that Lovzin&s;ki, a foe to the Ru&s;&s;ians, is not the enemy of his king."</P>
<P>The recital of our operations during eight &s;ucceeding years of bloody war would be unintere&s;ting. Sometimes van|qui&s;hed; much oftener victorious; equal|ly great in the mid&s;t of a defeat, as formi|dable after a victory, and always &s;uperior to events, Pula&s;ki attracted and fixed the attention of all Europe, whom he a&s;toni&s;h|ed by his long and vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. Obliged to abandon one province, he made incur&s;ions into, and performed new prodigies of valour in another: and it was thus, that, in marching &s;ucce&s;&s;ively thro'|out all the palatinates, he &s;ignalized in each of them, by &s;ome glorious exploit, that eternal hatred which he had &s;worn again&s;t the enemies of Poland.</P>

accu&s;tomed to the tumult of a camp, Lo|doi&s;ka accompanied us every where. Of five children which &s;he had borne me, an only daughter remained to us, about eighteen months old. One day, after a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate engagement, the victorious Ru&s;&s;ians precipitated them&s;elves towards my tent, on purpo&s;e to plunder it. Pu|la&s;ki and my&s;elf, followed by &s;ome no|bles, flew to the defence of Lodoi&s;ka, whom we &s;aved with difficulty; my daughter, however, had been carried off.</P>
<P>This lovely child, by a &s;age precaution which her mother had wi&s;ely made u&s;e of in tho&s;e times of inte&s;tine commotion, had the arms of our family impre&s;&s;ed, by means of a chemical preparation, under her left brea&s;t: but my &s;earch after my daughter has hitherto been ineffectual.&mdash; Alas! Dorli&s;ka, my dear Dorli&s;ka, either exi&s;ts in &s;lavery, or exi&s;ts no more!</P>
<P>This lo&s;s affected me with the mo&s;t lively &s;orrow.

<P>It, however became at length nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould abandon this &s;ituation, as provi&s;ions were beginning to be &s;carce. Pula&s;ki, on this occa&s;ion, came to my tent; and having ordered every one to retire, when he alone remained, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed me as follows:</P>
<P>"Lovzin&s;ki, I have ju&s;t rea&s;on for complaining of your conduct.

We are indeed bathed in Ru&s;&s;ian blood: our fellow citizens are avenged; but they are not &s;aved: nay, even in a &s;hort time we may be able no longer to defend them."</P>
<P>"You a&s;toni&s;h me, Pula&s;ki! Whence the&s;e &s;ini&s;ter auguries?"</P>
<P>"I am not alarmed without rea&s;on. Con&s;ider our pre&s;ent po&s;ition: I am forc|ed to awaken in every heart the love of its country; I have found no where but degenerate men born for &s;lavery, or weak ones, who, although penetrated with a &s;en&s;e of their misfortunes, have bounded all their views to barren complaints.</P>
<P>"Some true citizens are indeed, ran|ged under my &s;tandards; but eight long and bloody campaigns have le&s;&s;ened their number, and almo&s;t extingui&s;hed them. I become enfeebled by my very victories; our enemies appear more numerous after their defeats."</P>
<P>"I repeat to you, Pula&s;ki, once more, that you a&s;toni&s;h me! In circum&s;tances no le&s;s di&s;a&s;trous, no le&s;s unhappy, than the pre&s;ent, I have beheld you &s;u&s;tain your&s;elf by your courage. * * *</P>

<P>"What preparations have you made for &s;o great an enterprize?"</P>

&s;acrificed, when it is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of your country.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly mount my hor&s;e, and make &s;uch ha&s;te, that I arrive by the middle of next day at Czen&s;tachow. I here found forty brave men waiting for me, and de|termined for the mo&s;t hazardous enter|prize.</P>
<P>"Gentlemen," &s;aid I to them, "we are now met on purpo&s;e to carry a king out of the mid&s;t of his own capital.&mdash; Tho&s;e capable of attempting &s;uch an en|terprize, are alone capable of effecting it: either &s;ucce&s;s or death awaits on us!"</P>
<P>After this &s;hort harrangue we prepare to depart. Kaluv&s;ki, forewarned of our de&s;ign, had already procured twelve wag|gons, loaded with hay and &s;traw, each of which was drawn by four good hor&s;es.</P>
<P>We in&s;tantly di&s;gui&s;e our&s;elves as pea|&s;ants; we hide our clothes, our &s;abres, out pi&s;tols, and the &s;addles of our hor&s;es, in the hay with which our waggons were partly filled; we agree upon certain &s;igns, and I give them a <HI>watch-word,</HI> to be u&s;ed according to circum&s;tances. Twelve of the con&s;pirators, commanded by Ka|luv&s;ki, enter into War&s;aw, accompanied by as many waggons, which they them|&s;elves conduct. I divide the re&s;t of my
<PB N="89" REF="037849_0045_100F84F75174CBB8">
little troop into &s;everal brigades, on pur|po&s;e to avoid &s;u&s;picion: each is ordered to march at &s;ome di&s;tance from the other, and to gain the capital by different gates.</P>
<P>We depart, and on Saturday the 2d of November, 1771, arrive at War&s;aw, and lodge together at a convent belonging to the Dominicans.</P>
<P>On the next day, which was Sunday, and which will for ever form a memora|ble epoch in the annals of Poland, one of my people of the name of Stravin&s;ki, being covered with rags, places him&s;elf near the collegiate church, and &s;oon after proceeds demanding charity even at tho gates of the royal palace, where he ob|&s;erves every thing that pa&s;&s;ed. Several of the con&s;pirators walked up and down the fix narrow &s;treets, in the neighbour|hood of the great &s;quare, where Kaluv&s;ki and my&s;elf were po&s;ted. We remain in ambu&s;cade during the whole day, and part of the afternoon.</P>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock at night the king leaves the palace; he is followed, and is &s;een to enter the hotel of his uncle, the grand chancellor of Lithunia.</P>
<P>All our followers receive notice of this event, and a&s;&s;emble in&s;tantly: they throw off their mi&s;erable cloaths, &s;addle
<PB N="90" REF="037849_0046_100F84FB61637088">
their hor&s;es, and prepare their arms, in the large &s;quare belonging to the convent, where their movements are entirely con|cealed. They then &s;ally forth, one after the other, under favour of the night. Too well known in War&s;aw to hazard appearing there, without di&s;gui&s;ing my|&s;elf, I &s;till wear my pea&s;ant's dre&s;s, and I mount an excellent hor&s;e, capari&s;oned, however, after the common manner.</P>
<P>I then point out my followers the dif|ferent po&s;ts in the &s;uburbs, which I had a&s;&s;igned them before our departure from the convent, and they were di&s;per&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that all the avenues to the palace of the grand chancellor were carefully and &s;trictly guarded.</P>
<P>Between nine and ten o'clock at night, the king comes forth on purpo&s;e to re|turn home; and we remark, with joy, that his attendants were far from being numerous.</P>
<P>The carriage was preceded by two men, who carried <HI>flambeaux,</HI> &s;ome offi|cers of his &s;uit, two gentlemen and an e&s;quire followed. I know not what was the name of the grandee in the coach along with the king. There were two pages, one to each door, two hay dukes running by the &s;ide of the equipage, and
<PB N="91" REF="037849_0046_100F84FB61637088">
three footmen, in the royal livery be|hind.</P>
<P>The king proceeds &s;lowly: part of my people a&s;&s;emble at &s;ome di&s;tance; twelve of the mo&s;t determined &s;pring forward: I put my&s;elf at their head, and we advance at a good pace.</P>
<P>As there was a Ru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on at that very moment in War&s;aw, we effect to &s;peak the language of tho&s;e foreign|ers, &s;o that our petty troop might be mi&s;|taken for one of their patroles.</P>
<P>We overtake the carriage at about a hundred and fifty paces from the grand chancellor's palace, and exactly between tho&s;e of the bi&s;hop of Cracow and of the late grand general of Poland.</P>
<P>All of a &s;udden we pa&s;s the heads of the foremo&s;t hor&s;es, &s;o that tho&s;e who preceded, found them&s;elves &s;eparated from tho&s;e who &s;urrounded the royal equipage.</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly give the &s;ignal agreed upon. Kaluv&s;ki gallops up, with the remainder of the con&s;pirators: I pre&s;ent a pi&s;tol to the po&s;tilion, who in&s;tantly &s;tops; the coachmen is fired upon, and preci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itated beneath the wheels. Of the two hay-dukes who endeavoured to defend their prince, one drops, pierced with two

<P>He him&s;elf, however, pre&s;erving the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s in the mid&s;t of the dan|ger, had now de&s;cended from his car|riage, and was &s;triving to regain his un|cle's palace on foot. Kaluv&s;ki arre&s;ts and &s;eizes him by the hair; &s;even or eight of the con&s;pirators &s;urround, di&s;|arm, overpower him, and, pre&s;&s;ing him between their hor&s;es, make off at a full gallop towards the end of the &s;treet.</P>
<P>During this moment, I confe&s;s that I thought Pula&s;ki had ba&s;ely deceived me; that the death of the monarch was re&s;ol|ved upon, and that a plot had been formed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him.</P>
<P>All of a &s;udden I form my re&s;olves; I clap &s;purs to my hor&s;e, overtake the little band, cry out to them to &s;top, and threat|en to kill the fir&s;t per&s;on who &s;hould dare to di&s;obey me.</P>

Kaluv&s;ki and his followers &s;top at the &s;ound of my well known voice. We mount the king on hor&s;eback, make off at full &s;peed, and regain the ditch that &s;urrounded the city, which the mon|arch is con&s;trained to leap, in company with us.</P>
<P>At that moment a panic terror takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my troop; at fifty paces di&s;|tant from the ramparts, there were no more than &s;even who &s;urrounded the per|&s;on of the king.</P>
<P>The night was dark and rainy, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;mount every in&s;tant, on purpo&s;e to &s;ound the mora&s;s with which we were &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e on which the monarch rode fell twice, and broke his leg at the &s;econd fall; during the&s;e violent move|ment, his maje&s;ty lo&s;t his <HI>peli&s;&s;e,</HI> and the &s;hoe belonging to his left foot.</P>
<P>"If you wi&s;h that I &s;hould follow you, (&s;ays he to us) you mu&s;t furni&s;h me with another hor&s;e and a pair of boots."</P>
<P>We remount him once more, and, on purpo&s;e to gain the road by which Pula&s;|ki had promi&s;ed me to advance, we re|&s;olve to pa&s;s through a village called
<PB N="94" REF="037849_0048_100F85005C89FFF0">
Burakow; but the king exclaims, "Do not go that way; there are Ru&s;&s;ians there!"</P>
<P>I immediately change our <HI>route</HI>; but in proportion as we advance through the wood of Beliany, our number continues to dimini&s;h. In a &s;hort time, I perceive nobody around me but Kaluv&s;ki and Stravin&s;ki: a few minutes after, we are challenged by a Ru&s;&s;ian centinel on hor&s;ehack, at who&s;e voice we in&s;tantly &s;top, greatly alarmed for our &s;afety.</P>
<P>"Let us kill him!" cries the ferocious Kaluv&s;ki, pointing to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. I in|&s;tantly avow to him, without di&s;gui&s;e, the horror which &s;uch a propo&s;ition in|&s;pired me with. "Very well, you may then take upon you the ta&s;k of conducting him," adds this cruel hearted man who immediately after precipitates him&s;elf in|to the woods. Stravin&s;ki follows him, and I alone remain with the king.</P>
<P>"Lovzin&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">," &s;ays he, addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to me, as &s;oon as they were out of &s;ight; "it is you, I can no longer doubt it; it is you, for I well remember your voice!" I utter not a &s;ingle word in re|ply. He then mildly adds, "It is cer|tainly you Lovzin&s;ki! Who would have thought this ten years ago?"</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="037849_0048_100F85005C89FFF0">We find our&s;elves at that moment near to the convent of Beliany, di&s;tant no more than a &s;ingle league from War|&s;aw.</P>
<P>"Lovzin&s;ki," continues the king, "per|mit me to enter this convent, and &s;ave your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t follow me," was my only an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"It is in vain," rejoins the monarch, "that you are di&s;gui&s;ed; it is in vain that you endeavour to a&s;&s;ume a feigned voice: I know you well, I am fully a&s;&s;ured that you are Lovzin&s;ki: ah, who would have &s;aid &s;o ten years &s;ince? You would then have lo&s;t your life, on condition of pre&s;erving that of your friend."</P>
<P>His maje&s;ty now cea&s;es to &s;peak; we advance &s;ome time, in profound &s;ilence, which he again breaking, exclaims. "I am overcome with fatigue&mdash;<HI>if you wi&s;h to carry me alive, permit me to repo&s;e my&s;elf for a &s;ingle moment.</HI>"</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;i&s;t him to de&s;cend from his hor&s;e; he &s;its down upon the gra&s;s, and making me &s;it down by his &s;ide, he takes one of my hands and pre&s;&s;es it between his own:</P>
<P>"Lovzin&s;ki, you whom I have &s;o
<PB N="96" REF="037849_0049_100F8503727340B0">
much loved, you who know better than any one the purity of my intentions, how comes it obout that you have taken up arms again&s;t me? Ungrateful Lovzin&s;ki! &s;hall I never find you but among&s;t my mo&s;t bitter enemies? Do you return but on purpo&s;e to &s;acrifice me?"</P>
<P>He then, in the mo&s;t affecting lan|guage, recapitulates the plea&s;ure, of our early youth; our more intimate connec|tion at an age approaching to manhood, the tender friend&s;hip which we had &s;worn to each other, and the regard which he had ever treated me with &s;ince that pe|riod. He &s;poke to me of the honours with which he would have loaded me du|ring his reign, if I had been ambitious to merit them: he reproached me more particularly re&s;pecting the unworthy en|terpri&s;e of which I appeared to be the leader, but of which, he &s;aid, he was well a&s;&s;ured that I was no more than the in&s;tru|ment.</P>
<P>He threw all the horror of the plot upon Pula&s;ki, repre&s;enting to me, at the &s;ame time, that the author of &s;uch an at|tempt was not the &s;ole culpable per&s;on; that I could not charge my&s;elf with its execution without committing a crime; and that this odious complai&s;ance, &s;o
<PB N="97" REF="037849_0049_100F8503727340B0">
highly trea&s;onable in a &s;ubject, was infi|nitely more in a friend. He concluded by pre&s;&s;ing me to re&s;tore him to his liber|ty: "Fly," &s;aid he to me; and be a&s;|&s;ured, if I encounter any of the Ru&s;&s;ian patroles, I &s;hall tell them that you have pur&s;ued an oppo&s;ite road from that which you have taken."</P>
<P>The king continued to pre&s;s me with the mo&s;t earne&s;t entreaties: his natural eloquence, augmented by the danger of his &s;ituation, carried per&s;ua&s;ion to my heart, and awakened the mo&s;t tender &s;en|timents there.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s that I &s;taggered; I balan|ced the circum&s;tance for &s;ome time in my own mind, but Pulaski at length tri|umphed.</P>
<P>I thought that I &s;till heard the fierce republican reproaching me with my pu&s;il|lanimity. The love of one's country has perhaps its fanatici&s;m and its &s;uper&s;ti|tions: but if I was then culpable, I am &s;till &s;o; I am more than ever per&s;uaded that in obliging the king to remount his hor&s;e again, I performed an action that reflected honour on my patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>"Is it thus," &s;ays he to me, in a me|lancholy accent, "that you reject the prayer addre&s;&s;ed to you by a friend?
<PB N="98" REF="037849_0050_100F850782A19968">
that you refu&s;e the pardon offered to you by your king? Well then, let us be gone. I deliver my&s;elf up to my unhappy fate, or rather I abandon you to yours."</P>
<P>We now re-commence our journey once more; but the entreaties of the monarch, his arguments, his reproaches, his very menaces, the &s;truggles which I felt within my&s;elf, effected me in &s;uch a manner, that I no longer could di&s;cern my way. Wandering up and down the country, I kept no one certain road: after half an hour's fatigue we found our|&s;elves at Marimont, and I was greatly alarmed at &s;eeing us thus return towards War&s;aw, in&s;tead of leaving it at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>At about a quarter of league beyond this, we unfortunately fell in with a party of Ru&s;&s;ians. The king immediately di&s;|covers him&s;elf to the commanding offi|cer, and then in&s;tantly adds. "In the cour&s;e of the preceding afternoon, I hap|pened to bewilder my&s;elf during the chace; this good pea&s;ant, whom you &s;ee here, in&s;i&s;ted on my partaking a frugal repa&s;t in his cottage; but as I thought that I perceived &s;ome of the &s;oldiers of Pulaski roaming in the neighbourhood, I was de&s;irous of returning to War&s;aw immediately, and you will oblige me
<PB N="99" REF="037849_0050_100F850782A19968">
much by in&s;tantly accompanying me thither.</P>
<P>"As to you, my friend," continues he, turning at the &s;ame time towards me, "I am not at all &s;orry that you have given your&s;elf this u&s;ele&s;s trouble, for I am as much plea&s;ed at returning to my capital attended by the&s;e gentlemen (pointing at the &s;ame time to the e&s;cort) as in accompanying you any farther.&mdash; However, it would be improper that I &s;hould leave you without any recompence; what are you de&s;irous of? Speak&mdash;I will grant you any favour which you may de|mand of me!"</P>
<P>It will be ea&s;y to conceive how much I was alarmed, for I was &s;till doubtful of the king's intentions. I endeavoured to di&s;cover the true meaning of his equivo|cal di&s;cour&s;e, which mu&s;t be either full of a bitter irony, or magnanimous addre&s;s. M. de P&mdash; left me for &s;ome time in this cruel uncertainty: "I behold you great|ly embarra&s;&s;ed," continues he at length, with a gracious air; "you know not what to choo&s;e! Come then, my friend, embrace me: there is indeed more hon|or than profit in embracing a king (adds he with a &s;mile;) however, it mu&s;t be al|lowed, that in my place, many monarchs
<PB N="100" REF="037849_0051_100F850A9752B7E8">
would not be at this moment &s;o generous as my&s;elf!" On uttering the&s;e words, he in&s;tantly departs, leaving me penetrated with gratitude, and confounded with &s;o much true greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>However, the danger which the king had &s;o generou&s;ly relieved me from, it be|gan every moment to a&s;&s;ail me again. It was more than probable a great number of couriers expedited from War&s;aw, had &s;pread about on all &s;ides the a&s;toni&s;hing news of the king's having been carried off. Already, without doubt, the ravi&s;h|ers were warmly pur&s;ued. My remark|able dre&s;s might betray me in my flight, and if I once more fell into the hands of any of the Ru&s;&s;ians, better informed of the circum&s;tance, all the efforts of the king would not be able to &s;ave me. Sup|po&s;ing Pula&s;ki had obtained all the &s;ucce&s;s which he expected, he mu&s;t &s;till be at a great di&s;tance: a journey of ten more leagues at lea&s;t remained for me to per|form, and my hor&s;e was entirely &s;pent with fatigue: I endeavoured however to &s;pur him on, but he had not got five hun|dred paces before he fell under me.</P>
<P>A cavalier, well mounted, happened to pa&s;s along the road by the &s;ide of me, at this very moment; he perceiving the
<PB N="101" REF="037849_0051_100F850A9752B7E8">
poor animal tumble down, and thinking to amu&s;e him&s;elf at the expence of an un|fortunate pea&s;ant, he began to banter me about my &s;ituation. Piqued at his buf|foonery, I re&s;olved to puni&s;h him for his raillery, and &s;ecure my own flight at one and the &s;ame time: I, therefore, in&s;tant|ly pre&s;ent one of my pi&s;tols to his brea&s;t, and oblige him to &s;urrender his own hor&s;e to me: nay, I acknowledge to you, that forced by the peculiarity of my &s;ituation, I de&s;poiled him even of his cloak, which being very large, hid all my rags beneath it, which otherwi&s;e might have di&s;cover|ed me. I then ca&s;t my pur&s;e full of gold at the feet of the a&s;toni&s;hed traveller, and &s;prang forward as fa&s;t as my new hor&s;e would carry me.</P>
<P>Luckily for me, he was fre&s;h and vig|orous. I dart forward twelve leagues, with all the &s;wiftne&s;s of an arrow: at length I think I hear the firing of can|non, and I in&s;tantly conjecture that my father-in-law was at hand, and was em|ployed in fighting the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>I was not deceived&mdash;I arrive on the field of battle at the very moment when one of our regiments had given way. I in&s;tantly di&s;cover my&s;elf to the fugitives, and having rallied them beneath a neigh|bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing

hill, I attack the enemies in flank, while Pulaski charged them in front with the remainder of his troops. Our manoeuvres were &s;o well concerted, and &s;o admirably executed, that the Ru&s;&s;ians were entirely routed, after experiencing a terrible carnage.</P>
<P>Pulaski deigned to attribute to me the honour of their defeat: "Ah!" cries he, embracing me, after hearing the par|ticulars of my expedition&mdash;"ah! if your forty followers had but equalled you in courage, the king would have been at this very moment in my camp! But the Dei|ty does not will it. I am grateful, how|ever, that you have been pre&s;erved to us; and I return you thanks for the important &s;ervice which you have rendered me: but for you, Kaluvski would have a&s;&s;inated the monarch, and my name would have been covered with an eternal oppro|brium!</P>
<P>"I might have been able," added he, "to have advanced two miles farther: but I rather cho&s;e to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this re&s;pectable po&s;t, on account of the &s;ecurity of my camp. Ye&s;terday, in the cour&s;e of my march, I &s;urpri&s;ed and cut to pieces a party of Ru&s;&s;ians; this morn|ing I beat two more of their detachments
<PB N="103" REF="037849_0052_100F850D2E704E40">
&mdash;but another con&s;iderable corps having collected the remainder of the vanqui&s;h|ed, took advantage of the night, on pur|po&s;e to attack me. My &s;oldiers, fatigued with the toil of a long march, and three &s;ucceeding engagements, began to fly; but victory returned to my camp at your approach. Let us entrench our&s;elves here; we will wait for the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and fight while we yet have a drop of blood remaining!"</P>
<P>In the mean time, the camp re&s;ounded with the cries of gladne&s;s, and our victo|rious &s;oldiers mingled my prai&s;es with tho&s;e of Pulaski. At the noi&s;e of my name, repeated by a thou&s;and tongues, Lodoiska ran to her father's tent. She convinced me of the exce&s;s of her tender|ne&s;s, by the exce&s;s of her joy at our meet|ing; and I was obliged once more to commence the recital of the dangers from which I had e&s;caped. She could not hear of the &s;ingular genero&s;ity of the mo|narch, when I was in the power of the Ru&s;&s;ians, without &s;hedding tears: "How magnanimous he is!" exclaims &s;he, amid&s;t a tran&s;port of joy: "how worthy of being a king, he who &s;o generou&s;ly pardoned you! How many &s;ighs has he &s;pared a wife whom you for&s;ake! how many tears

the loving wife whom you are not afraid of &s;acrificing! Cruel Lovzinski, are not the dangers to which you daily expo&s;e your&s;elf &s;ufficient&mdash;"</P>
<P>Pulaski here interrupts his daughter with a certain degree of har&s;hne&s;s: "In|di&s;creet and weak woman!" exclaims he, "is it before me that you dare hold &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e as this?"</P>
<P>"Alas!" replies &s;he in a mild accent; "alas! mu&s;t I forever tremble for the life of a father and a hu&s;band?" Lodoiska al&s;o made the mo&s;t affecting complaints to me, and &s;ighed after a more happy fu|turity, while fortune was preparing for us the mo&s;t cruel rever&s;e.</P>
<P>Our Co&s;&s;acks, placed at the out-po&s;ts, now came in from all parts, and inform|ed us that the Ru&s;&s;ian army was ap|proaching. Pulaski reckoned on being attacked at the break of day: but he was not: however, about the middle of the following night I was informed that the enemy were preparing to force our en|trenchments.</P>
<P>Pulaski always ready, always active, was actually defending them: during the cour&s;e of this fatal night, he achieved ev|ery thing that might have been expected from his valour and experience.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="037849_0053_100F850F03532688">We repel the a&s;&s;ailants no le&s;s than five different times, but they return un|cea&s;ingly to the charge, pour in fre&s;h troops at every new attack, and, during the la&s;t one, penetrate into the very heart of our camp by three different avenues, at one and the &s;ame time.</P>

<P>It indeed belonged to a noble Pole, who had &s;erved during &s;ome time in our army. Mici&s;las in&s;tantly comes forth, and offers an a&s;ylum, which he advi&s;es us, however, to make u&s;e of for a few hours only. He informs us, that a very a&s;toni&s;hing piece of news had &s;pread a|broad on the former evening, and began to be confirmed, according to which the king him&s;elf had been carried away out of War&s;aw, that the Ru&s;&s;ians had pur&s;ued the con&s;pirators, and brought back the monarch to his capital; and that, in fine, it was talked of putting a price upon the head of Pula&s;ki, who was &s;u&s;pected of be|ing the author of this trea&s;on.</P>
<P>"Believe me," &s;ays he, "when I a&s;|&s;ure you, whether you have been engaged or not in this bold plot, that you ought to fly; leave your uniforms here, which will a&s;&s;uredly betray you: I will in&s;tant|ly &s;upply you with clothes which are le&s;s remarkable: and as to Lodoi&s;ka, I my|&s;elf will conduct her to the place which you have cho&s;en or your retreat."</P>

<P>Pula&s;ki repre&s;ents to his daughter, that &s;he is not able to &s;u&s;tain the fatigue inci|dent to &s;uch a long journey, and be&s;ides we &s;hould be liable to continual dangers.</P>
<P>"The greater the peril is," replies &s;he, "the more I ought to partake it with you. You have repeated to me a hundred times, that the daughter of Pula&s;ki ought not to be an ordinary woman.

<P>Pula&s;ki now communicates to us the de&s;ign which he had formed of taking refuge in Turkey. He hoped to be employed in a &s;ituation equal to his rank and his abilities, in the armies of the grand &s;ignior, who had for the two la&s;t years with &s;ome difficulty &s;u&s;tained a di&s;a&s;trous war again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as the day appeared, we re|tired into the wood: hid either in the trunks of trees, or in thick groves of pines, we waited impatiently for the re|turn of night, on purpo&s;e to continue our march.

<P>One day as Lodoi&s;ka, &s;till di&s;gui&s;ed as a pea&s;ant, returned from a neighbouring hamlet, where &s;he had gone on purpo&s;e to purcha&s;e the provi&s;ions which &s;he was now conveying to us, two Ru&s;&s;ian ma|rauders attacked her at the entry of the fore&s;t in which we were concealed.</P>

<P>Ju&s;tly alarmed at this intelligence, we remain but a few hours in this town, where we, however found means to pur|cha&s;e &s;ome hor&s;es without being di&s;cov|ered.</P>
<P>We then pa&s;s the De&s;na above Czer|nicove;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Czernicove, or Czernikou, is a con&s;id|erable town and is the capital of the duchy of the &s;ame name.

<P>It was now again become nece&s;&s;ary to

fly once more, and once more to change our route; we therefore in&s;tantly made for the immen&s;e fore&s;ts which cover the face of the country between the Sula and the Zem, in the dark retreats of which we hoped to find &s;helter from our foes.</P>
<P>We at length di&s;cover a cavern, in which we were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of taking up our abode. A &s;he-bear di&s;|putes with us the entrance into this a&s;y|lum equally &s;olitary and frightful; we a&s;&s;ail, we kill her, and devour her young.</P>
<P>Pula&s;ki was wounded in this encoun|ter: Lodoiska, worn out with fatigue and di&s;tre&s;s, was &s;carcely able to &s;upport her exi&s;tence: the winter was approach|ing, and the cold was already exce&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Pur&s;ued by the Ru&s;&s;ians in the inhabit|ed parts; menaced by wild and ferocious animals in this va&s;t de&s;art; de&s;titute of any arms but our &s;words; reduced in a &s;hort time to eat our very hor&s;es; what was to become of us?</P>
<P>The danger of the &s;ituation to which my father-in-law and my wife were re|duced, had become &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, that no other fear any longer alarmed me. My per&s;onal &s;afety, hitherto &s;o dear to me, did not now &s;ugge&s;t it&s;elf once to my mind: I felt only for theirs. I re&s;olved,

therefore, to procure to them at any rate tho&s;e &s;uccours which their &s;ituation re|quired, which was &s;till more deplorable than my own; and leaving them both with the promi&s;e of rejoining them in a &s;hort time, I take a few of the diamonds belonging to Lodoiska, and follow the &s;tream of the Warsklo.</P>
<P>It is well known that a traveller, be|wildered amid&s;t tho&s;e va&s;t countries, and reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of wandering a|bout without a compa&s;s, and without a guide, is obliged to follow the cour&s;e of a river, becau&s;e it is upon its banks that the habitations of mankind are mo&s;t com|monly to be met with.</P>

<P>I make ha&s;te to &s;ell my diamonds, to purcha&s;e powder, arms, and provi&s;ions of all kinds, different uten&s;ils, and &s;ome coar&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary furniture; every thing, in fine, which I judged mo&s;t pro|per to relieve our mi&s;ery, and &s;often our misfortunes.&mdash;With the&s;e I load a wag|gon, drawn by four good hor&s;es, of which I was the only conductor.</P>
<P>My return was equally tedious and dif|ficult; no le&s;s than eight whole days ex|pired before I arrived at the entrance of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>It was there that, terminating my di&s;a|greeable and dangerous journey, I was about to &s;uccour my father-in-law and my wife; that I was about to revi&s;it all that was mo&s;t dear to me in the world; and yet I felt none of tho&s;e tran&s;ports of joy which &s;uch an event &s;eemed likely to in&s;pire.</P>

<P>Certain it is, however, that I experi|enced an involuntary unea&s;ine&s;s: my mind became di&s;pirited, di&s;mayed, and &s;omething, I know not what, &s;eemed to whi&s;per to me, that the mo&s;t unhappy moment of my whole life was fa&s;t ap|proaching.</P>
<P>On my departure, I had placed &s;everal flint&s;tones at certain di&s;tances, on purpo&s;e to enable me to retrace my road; but I could not now di&s;cover them. I had al|&s;o cut off with my &s;abre large pieces of the bark of &s;everal trees, which I could not now perceive. I enter the fore&s;t, however: I hollow with all my &s;trength: I di&s;charge my gun from time to time, but nobody an&s;wers me. I dared not tru&s;t my&s;elf among the trees and &s;hrubs for fear of lo&s;ing my way back again; neither could I wander too far from my waggon, which was &s;tored with provi&s;ions &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Pula&s;ki, his daughter, and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The night, which now approached, obliged me to give over my &s;earch, and I pa&s;s it in the &s;ame manner as the former. Rolled up in my cloak, I lay down be|neath my waggon, which I had carefully
<PB N="118" REF="037849_0060_100F8522E8B2F9D0">
&s;urrounded with my larger moveables, and which thus &s;erved me as a rampart again&s;t the wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>I could not &s;leep; the cold was ex|tremely inten&s;e; the &s;now fell in great abundance; at break of day I looked a|round, and found all the ground covered with it. From that moment I formed the mo&s;t horrible and the mo&s;t &s;ini&s;ter pre&s;ages: the &s;tones which might have pointed out the path I was to have ta|ken, were all buried, and it appeared im|po&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever be able to di&s;cover my father-in-law and my wife.</P>
<P>Had the hor&s;e, which I had left with them at my departure, afforded them &s;uf|ficient &s;u&s;tenance ever &s;ince? Had not hunger, cruel hunger, obliged them to fly from their retreat? Were they &s;till con|cealed in tho&s;e frightful de&s;erts? If they were not there, where &s;hould I be able to find them? Where, without them, &s;hould I drag out my mi&s;erable exi&s;t|ence?</P>
<P>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>
<P>But could I believe that Pula&s;ki had abandoned his &s;on-in-law? that Lodoiska had con&s;ented to &s;eparate her&s;elf from

<P>The&s;e de&s;perate reflections at length determined my conduct, and I no longer examined whether or not, in removing at a di&s;tance from my waggon, I was in danger of never finding it again. To car|ry &s;ome provi&s;ions to my father-in-law and wife, to &s;uccour Pula&s;ki and Lodo|i&s;ka&mdash;the&s;e were now the only &s;entiments that occupied my mind.</P>
<P>I accordingly &s;eize my fowling piece, take &s;ome powder and &s;hot, and load one of my hor&s;es with nece&s;&s;aries: I pierce into the woods much farther than during the former evening; I again hollow with all my &s;trength; I again make frequent di&s;charges with my gun. The mo&s;t me|lancholy &s;ilence reigned around me.</P>
<P>I now find my&s;elf in a part of the fo|re&s;t where the trees were &s;o extremely thick, that there was no longer any pa&s;|&s;age for my hor&s;e: I, therefore, tie him to a tree, and my de&s;pair getting the bet|ter of every other con&s;ideration, I &s;till

<P>Hope gives me new &s;trength, and I therefore in&s;tantly follow the traces which are &s;till fre&s;h. Soon after I di&s;cover Pu|la&s;ki almo&s;t naked, emaciated with hun|ger, and &s;o changed as &s;carce to be known even by me!</P>

<P>"Alas!" &s;ays he, "you will &s;ee her there!" The tone of voice in which he pronounced the&s;e words made me trem|ble.

<HEAD>THE STORY OF Alcander and Septimius. Taken from a Byzantine Hi&s;torian.</HEAD>

<P>In this city, and about this period, Al|cander and Septimius were fellow &s;tu|dents together; the one, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle rea&s;oner of all the Lyceum; the other the mo&s;t eloquent &s;peaker in the academ|ic grove. Mutual admiration &s;oon beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t friend&s;hip. Their fortunes were nearly
<PB N="134" REF="037849_0068_100F8538E9EB9140">
equal, and they were natives of the two mo&s;t celebrated cities in the world; for Alcander was of Athens, Septimius came from Rome.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of harmony they lived for &s;ome time together, when Alcander, af|ter pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t part of his youth in the indolence of philo&s;ophy, thought at length of entering into the bu&s;y world; and, as a &s;tep previous to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a lady of exqui|&s;ite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremo|nies were performed; and nothing now remained but her being conducted in tri|umph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom.</P>
<P>Alcander's exultation in his own hap|pine&s;s, or being unable to enjoy any &s;atis|faction without making his friend Septi|mius a partner, prevailed upon him to in|troduce Hypatia to his fellow-&s;tudent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found him&s;elf equally happy in friend&s;hip and love. But this was an in|terview fatal to the future peace of both; for Septimius no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but he was &s;mitten with an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion; and though he u&s;ed every effort to &s;up|pre&s;s de&s;ires at once &s;o imprudent and
<PB N="135" REF="037849_0068_100F8538E9EB9140">
unju&s;t, the emotions of his mind in a &s;hort time became &s;o &s;trong, that they brought on a fever, which the phy&s;icians judged incurable.</P>
<P>During this illne&s;s, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondne&s;s, and brought his mi&s;tre&s;s to join in tho&s;e am|iable offices of friend&s;hip. The &s;agacity of the phy&s;icians, by the&s;e means, &s;oon di&s;covered that the cau&s;e of their patient's di&s;order was love; and Alcander being appri&s;ed of their di&s;covery, at length ex|torted a confe&s;&s;ion from the reluctant dy|ing lover.</P>
<P>It would but delay the narrative to de|&s;cribe the conflict between love and friend&s;hip in the brea&s;t of Alcander on this occa&s;ion; it is enough to &s;ay, that the Athenians were at this time arrived at &s;uch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exce&s;s. In &s;hort, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young Roman. They were married privately by his connivance, and this un|looked for change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the con&s;titution of the now happy Septimius. In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and &s;et out with his fair partner for Rome. Here,
<PB N="136" REF="037849_0069_100F853B9DCC18F8">
by an exertion of tho&s;e talents which he was &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, Septimius, in a few years, arrived at the highe&s;t dig|nities of the &s;tate, and was con&s;tituted the city judge or praetor.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Alcander not only felt the pain of being &s;eparated from his friend and his mi&s;tre&s;s, but a pro&s;ecution was al&s;o commenced again&s;t him, by the relations of Hypatia, for having ba&s;ely given up his bride, as was &s;ugge&s;ted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to with&s;tand the influence of a powerful party. He was ca&s;t and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to rai&s;e &s;o large a &s;um at the time appointed, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were confi&s;ca|ted, he him&s;elf was &s;tripped of the habit of freedom, expo&s;ed as a &s;lave in the market-place, and &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>A merchant of Thrace becoming his purcha&s;er, Alcander, with &s;ome other companions of di&s;tre&s;s, was carried into that region of de&s;olation and &s;terility.&mdash; His &s;tated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious ma&s;ter, and his &s;uc|ce&s;s in hunting was all that was allowed

him to &s;upply his precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of &s;ea&s;on &s;erved but to aggravate his un&s;hel|tered di&s;tre&s;s. After &s;ome years of bon|dage, however, an opportunity of e&s;cap|ing offered; he embraced it with ardour; &s;o that, travelling by night, and lodging in caverns by day, to &s;horten a long &s;to|ry, he at la&s;t arrived in Rome. The &s;ame day on which Alcander arrived, Septimius &s;at admini&s;tering ju&s;tice in the forum, whither our wanderer came, ex|pecting to be in&s;tantly known, and public|ly acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he &s;tood the whole day among&s;t the crowd, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of; but he was &s;o much altered by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hard&s;hips, that he con|tinued unnoticed among the re&s;t; and, in the evening, when he was going up to the praetors chair, he was brutally repul&s;ed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another: for night coming on, he now found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking a place to lie in and yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated and in rags, as he was, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

of the citizens would harbour &s;o much wretchedne&s;s; and &s;leeping in the &s;treets might be attended with interruption or danger: in &s;hort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs with|out the city, the u&s;ual retreat of guilt, poverty, and de&s;pair. In this man&s;ion of horror, laying his head upon an in|verted urn, he forgot his mi&s;eries for a while in &s;leep; and found, on his flinty couch, more ea&s;e than beds of down can &s;upply to the guilty.</P>
<P>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their re|treat; but, happening to di&s;agree about the divi&s;ion of their plunder, one of them &s;tabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was found next morning, dead, at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enqui|ry, an alarm was &s;pread; the cave was examined, and Alcander being found, was immediately apprehended, and accu|&s;ed of robbery and murder. The cir|cum&s;tances again&s;t him were &s;trong, and the wretchedne&s;s of his appearance con|firmed &s;u&s;picion. Misfortune and he were now &s;o long acquainted, that he at la&s;t became regardle&s;s of life. He dete&s;t|ed

a world where he had found only ingratitude, fal&s;ehood, and cruelty; he was determined to make no defence; and thus, lowering with re&s;olution, he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribunal of Septimius. As the proofs were po&s;itive again&s;t him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a mo&s;t cruel and ignominious death, when the attention of the multitude was &s;oon divi|ded by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehend|ed &s;elling his plunder, and, &s;truck with a panic, had confe&s;&s;ed his crime. He was bro't bound to the &s;ame tribunal, and ac|quitted every other per&s;on of any partner|&s;hip in his guilt. Alcander's innocence therefore appeared, but the &s;ullen ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct remained a wonder to the &s;urrounding multitude; but their a&s;ton|i&s;hment was &s;till further increa&s;ed, when they &s;aw their judge &s;tart from his tribu|nal to embrace the &s;uppo&s;ed criminal. Septimius recollected his friend and for|mer benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy. Need the &s;equel be related?

<P>WE frequently find that when the mind has been long em|ployed on one object, a &s;light derange|ment of the rea&s;oning faculty is the con|&s;equence, which is often better remedied by gentle &s;oothing treatment, than by more violent methods.</P>
<P>Lucy Belgrove was the daughter of a gentleman of con&s;iderable property, in the we&s;t of England. She was a young lady of a tender and delicate frame of body, and a lively and &s;u&s;ceptible imagi|nation. The peru&s;al of romances, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a pa&s;toral kind, was her principal amu&s;ement, which at length had &s;o powerful an effect on her fancy, that &s;he &s;ighed for nothing &s;o much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> plea&s;ure of lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding the life of an Ar|cadian

She would wander from morning to night about the fields, furni&s;hed by fancy with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ewes and lambs, with a crook in her hand, and all the ap|purtenances of the pa&s;toral life, &s;upreme|ly happy in her vi&s;ionary occupation.</P>
<P>As, notwith&s;tanding this innocent phrenzy, &s;he was of a truly beautiful per|&s;on, a delicate and amiable di&s;po&s;ition, and heire&s;s to a large fortune, &s;he had nu|merous admirers and &s;uitors; but none of the&s;e were &s;o much as permitted to tell their tender tales of love; the heart and the imagination of the lady were entirely engro&s;&s;ed by another object: &s;he turned a deaf ear to all their amorous complaints, and &s;ought the woods and &s;hady groves.</P>
<P>At length, a young gentleman in the neighbourhood, who had long admired her beauty and amiable qualities, while he pitied the peculiar derangement of her mind, determined to try the effect of hu|mouring her in her pa&s;toral phrenzy. He a&s;&s;umed the habit of an Arcadian &s;wain, followed her into the fields with his crook and his pipe, and playing on the latter, &s;oothed her with pa&s;toral airs. Approaching her with mode&s;t diffidence

he wooed her as a &s;hepherd enamoured of a &s;hepherde&s;s. In this character &s;he li&s;tened to him.

<P>"INABILITY, by rea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s, has till now, prevented my acknowledging the re|ceipt of your favour of the "Child's Spelling Book" &s;ome time &s;ince; I have peru&s;ed it with plea&s;ure; and e&s;teem it a very valuable per|formance, and well adapted and calculated for the u&s;e and benefit of &s;chools; and &s;hall, as I have opportunity, recommend it accordingly.</P>

<P>"TWO copies of the "Child's Spelling Book," viz. one of the fir&s;t, and the other of the &s;econd edition, pre&s;ented by you, came to hand &s;ome time &s;ince: I thank you, &s;ir, for them. Various things, needle&s;s to mention, have pre|prevented my writing till now.</P>
<P>"By your de&s;ire, I have examined, with care, the material parts of the book, and think it well adapted to an&s;wer the de&s;ign of its publication. I view it as a u&s;eful introduction to the larger Spelling Books; and have freely recommended it. It begins to be introduced into our &s;chools; and probably in a &s;hort time, will generally be purcha&s;ed by parents for their <HI>younger</HI> child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en. The moderate price is a &s;econdary recommend|ation to per&s;ons in indigent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB REF="037849_0073_100F85459CB2D510">In the &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion you have made a very valuable addition; particularly, by in&s;ert|ing the young child's Catechi&s;m, &s;undry excel|lent Hymns, and a copious collection of Rules for the behaviour of children, calculated to form them betimes, not only to morality but to a poli&s;hed behaviour in the various places which they fill in &s;ociety, and relations which they &s;tand to mankind around them.</P>
