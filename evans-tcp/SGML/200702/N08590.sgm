<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE following piece was written but a &s;hort time before the repeal of the &s;tamp-act; and as the &s;ubject of it was of the mo&s;t general and important nature, the trifling altera|tion of circum&s;tances which a few months have produced, cannot prevent it's being as applicable to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our affairs, as to tho&s;e di&s;a|greeable controver&s;ies, in which we have been heretofore unhappily involved. The conciliating &s;pirit which prevailed upon the fir&s;t intelligence of the &s;tamp-act's being repealed, prevented its pub|lication then; though the author was ever per|fectly convinced, the colonies would not long have any rea&s;on to flatter them&s;elves, that the repeal of this act was a &s;acrifice to liberty; or that it pro|ceeded from any thing more than an apprehen&s;ion of the ill con&s;equences which our brethren of <HI>Britain</HI> mu&s;t have felt from the oeconomical re&s;o|lutions which we had formed. Upon examining the debates, previous to the repeal, if any one could have doubted the &s;en&s;e of the legi&s;lature, the act for &s;ecuring the dependence of the colo|nies, would have reduced it to a &s;ufficient degree of certainty. Indeed, if this act had been more equivocal, the billeting act was explicit enough to have pointed out clearly to every common under|&s;tanding, their <HI>generous meaning</HI>&mdash;A meaning evidenced by &s;uch mea&s;ures as could not but ex|cite the mo&s;t alarming apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>In mixt forms of government, where the deli|cacy of the con&s;titution requires the &s;tricte&s;t at|tention,
<PB N="4" REF="010986_0004_0F852EF67AEDC120">
to the movements of each di&s;tinct part, jealous fears frequently intervene, upon the &s;light|e&s;t appearance of irregularity. The hi&s;tory of <HI>England,</HI> alone, will furni&s;h us with facts &s;uffi|cient to &s;upport this a&s;&s;ertion; &s;ince every man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of hi&s;torical know|ledge, mu&s;t certainly have ob&s;erved, that before any mea&s;ure of importance could obtain the ne|ce&s;&s;ary approbation of the three e&s;tates of the kingdom, it fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed a &s;evere and critical exami|nation; le&s;t a &s;uperior addre&s;s in either of the parties intere&s;ted, &s;hould give them&s;ome particu|lar advantage&mdash;le&s;t a de&s;igning mini&s;ter &s;hould extend the prerogative of the crown, or an artful commoner increa&s;e the liberty of the &s;ubject. A few thou&s;ands added to the military li&s;t, have a|larmed the whole nation; and a body of troops, not equal to tho&s;e upon the <HI>American</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, have with the mo&s;t terrible apprehen&s;ions, been con&s;idered as a formidable army,&mdash;&s;o aver&s;e have the people of <HI>England</HI> ever been, to tru&s;t their liberties, even with the be&s;t of men, that they have cho&s;en to depend upon the precarious aid of &s;ub&s;idiary troops, rather than put arms into the hands of their own countrymen: while there was the lea&s;t probability that tho&s;e arms might be employed to the &s;ubver&s;ion of liberty. This conduct, I only mean to remark as con&s;i&s;t|ent with the genius of liberty: and, though its policy, when critically examined, may not appear altogether unexceptionable, yet will the <HI>jealous caution</HI> which produced it, be ever con&s;idered as the grand bulwark of freedom. When I apply my&s;elf to con&s;ider the &s;ituation of the coloni&s;ts, I cannot but ob&s;erve that they labour under diffi|culties peculiar to them&s;elves. They have not only to guard their libertles again&s;t the encroach|ments
<PB N="5" REF="010986_0005_0F852EF69983E7F8">
of the royal prerogative, but even to pro|tect their property again&s;t the inva&s;ions of their more powerful brethren. The people of <HI>England</HI> have only one &s;ingle defence to make for the pre|&s;ervation of their freedom; and, if the &s;y&s;tem of venality and corruption, which now &s;o generally prevails, does not gradually lead them into a &s;tate of &s;lavery, no open violence can ever affect it. Far different is the &s;ituation of the divided <HI>Ame|ricans.</HI> Of them every di&s;tinct colony has hither|to been con&s;idered as a particular plantation of the crown, and been governed by &s;uch loo&s;e, di&s;|cretionary powers as were better calculated to &s;up|port the <HI>de&s;po&s;iti&s;m</HI> of a mini&s;ter than the <HI>liberties</HI> of the &s;ettlers. They are now con&s;idered as dan|gerous rivals, and their unprotected intere&s;ts mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice to tho&s;e of their jealous brethren. An artful, de&s;igning mini&s;ter would naturally en|deavour to conciliate the affections of tho&s;e who more immediately &s;urround the throne, by re|moving any burthens from their &s;houlders, and &s;ixing them upon tho&s;e, by who&s;e murmurs and complaints, he could not be &s;o immediately af|fected. To gratify the de&s;ires of his &s;elfi&s;h coun|trymen, and flatter them with the appearance of an <HI>unnatural &s;uperiority;</HI> he would willingly &s;ub|&s;cribe to any acts for the limiting our trade, and re&s;training our manufactures: But perfectly con|vinced that the <HI>Americans</HI> will neither be &s;o &s;tupid as not to perceive the iniquity of the&s;e mea&s;ures, nor &s;o pa&s;&s;ive as patiently to &s;ubmit to their be|ing carried into execution, he prudently prepares to &s;upport them by means as infamous and op|pre&s;&s;ive as tho&s;e which are to be &s;upported. Though our <HI>European</HI> neighbours are driven from the continent; and, though our &s;avage enemies have long &s;ince laid down the hatchet, yet have
<PB N="6" REF="010986_0006_0F852EF78B422420">
our careful guardians left us with a very con&s;idera|ble body of troops, and are daily &s;ending over fre&s;h &s;upplies&mdash;<HI>to protect us from any future dangers;</HI> when it cannot but be evident to every man of common knowledge, that in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, we are both able and willing to defend our own frontiers, without putting the govern|ment to the trouble of tran&s;porting troops for that purpo&s;e, at &s;uch an immen&s;e expence. We have now &s;ixteen regiments di&s;tributed through the different colonies&mdash;mo&s;t of them in&s;tead of being a defence to our frontiers, are a burthen to our maritime cities; where they are, by virtue of an act of the Briti&s;h parliament, to be plentifully &s;upplied with nece&s;&s;aries at the expence of the place where they may be quartered; and as the quartering them depends altogether upon the ar|bitrary will of the commanding officer, he is ab|&s;olutely ve&s;ted with a power of oppre&s;&s;ing any &s;in|gle colony, which may have been &s;o unfortunate as to have incurred the re&s;entment of tho&s;e who appointed him.</P>
<P>When the mini&s;try, re&s;olved to burthen us with &s;o many troops, it was not thought proper to make the u&s;ual requi&s;itions to the different a&s;&s;em|blies for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. The power of parliament had met with an unexpected oppo&s;ition, in their fir&s;t attempts to enforce the &s;tamp act. Urged by a prudent attention to their own inte|re&s;ts, they had indeed determined to repeal this oppre&s;&s;ive act; but le&s;t this extraordinary conce&s;|&s;ion &s;hould be con&s;idered as an acknowledgment of right, they determined to exert their authority once more in a manner &s;o explicit, as &s;hould leave us no room to doubt their meaning.</P>
<P>One act is pa&s;&s;ed to declare the dependence of the colonies upon the <HI>imperial crown and parlia|ment
<PB N="7" REF="010986_0007_0F852EF836BFD2C8">
of Great-Britain;</HI> and that dependence is immediately proved by a law for billeting &s;oldiers in America, and for obliging tho&s;e places, in which the commanding officer may think proper to quarter them, to grant certain very ample &s;up|plies of nece&s;&s;aries. Upon application to the go|vernment of New-York, the general a&s;&s;embly of that province &s;hewed their readine&s;s to comply with every thing that might be required for the accommodation of tho&s;e troops which had con|tributed to the valuable acqui&s;itions in <HI>America.</HI> They framed a law for the purpo&s;e, and granted a &s;ufficiency of &s;uch articles as they conceived mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;oldiers: They did not indeed comply with every particular contained in the act of parliament&mdash;perhaps it might not be in their power. If any thing was to be given by the coloni&s;ts for the accommodation of the &s;oldiery, &s;urely they were the be&s;t judges, of their own abilities, as well as of tho&s;e articles which they could mo&s;t conveniently procure. If the parliament had thought proper to have ordered porter in&s;tead of &s;mall beer, and gin in&s;tead of rum, they would &s;carcely have procured a &s;uffici|ent quantity, had they even &s;ought it with fixt bayonets. Although the inhabitants could not but be alarmed at a requi&s;ition &s;upported by the whole legi&s;lative authority, yet did they prudently decline taken notice of &s;uch an <HI>extraordinary pro|cedure,</HI> and very mode&s;tly re&s;olved to comply with the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of the act without any immediate reference to the <HI>act it&s;elf.</HI> Some triffling alterati|ons were indeed made in the &s;tipulated allowances; but &s;o incon&s;iderable were they that I believe the &s;oldiery complained but little of the alteration; and I cannot think that the greate&s;t enemy to A|merica ever imagined that the freemen of New-York,
<PB N="8" REF="010986_0008_0F852EF8D135EDF8">
when they u&s;ed a di&s;cretionary power in granting a &s;hare of their own private property, for the u&s;e of the army, and were hardy enough to deviate, in &s;ome minute particulars, from the directions of the Briti&s;h parliament, would ever have excited &s;o violent&mdash;&s;o unju&s;tifiable a re|&s;entment. A re&s;entment expre&s;&s;ed by a proceed|ing the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and uncon&s;titutional&mdash;&s;uch a proceeding as mu&s;t prove, beyond all po&s;&s;i|bility of contradiction, that whatever conce&s;&s;ions we may receive from a prudent attachment to their own intere&s;t, we can expect nothing from a generous attention to the &s;pirit of their own hap|py con&s;titution, or from an hone&s;t reluctance to invade the natural rights of their fellow-&s;ubjects.</P>

<BIBL>CLAUD.</BIBL>
<P>MR. PITT, has frequently declared that the freemen of Great-Britain have no right to take money out of our pockets, without fir&s;t ob|taining our con&s;ent; and yet their repre&s;entatives in parliament have re&s;olved, without deigning to con&s;ult us, that we &s;hall pay a certain &s;um for furni&s;hing the &s;oldiery with particular nece&s;&s;aries. Unwilling to revive a conte&s;t, which had ju&s;t be|fore been &s;ettled &s;o much to our &s;atisfaction, we declined renewing the di&s;pute with regard to the legality of the act. We were contented to receive it as a <HI>rea&s;onable requi&s;ition,</HI> though not as <HI>a bind|ing law;</HI> and, con&s;ulting our own abilities and conveniency, we granted &s;uch articles as we thought would an&s;wer <HI>the de&s;ign of the act.</HI> In this conduct. &s;o remarkably temperate, we have incurred the highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of the Briti&s;h par|liament,
<PB N="9" REF="010986_0009_0F852EFE355AEF80">
and are expo&s;ed, as a puni&s;hment due to our offences, to one of the mo&s;t general, and &s;e|vere&s;t penalties which the hand of power could in|flict. An act has pa&s;&s;ed to &s;trip us of our legi&s;la|tive power, and render us unable to provide for our&s;elves in a &s;ituation of the mo&s;t imminent dan|ger; becau&s;e we have outrageou&s;ly refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe to our own ruin. We have mode&s;tly a|voided controverting a point of the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> impor|tance, le&s;t we &s;hould draw upon our&s;elves a charge of <HI>ob&s;tinacy</HI> and <HI>malevolence.</HI> We have complied with the <HI>meaning,</HI> though not with the <HI>letter</HI> of the act. We have evidenced the mo&s;t grateful and complying di&s;po&s;ition, and are neverthele&s;s doomed to receive the puni&s;hment of the mo&s;t re|bellious oppo&s;ition. If our every act is thus liable to be mi&s;con&s;trued, and we are patiently to receive &s;uch &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement, we mu&s;t at once renounce the name of free-men, and accommodate our|&s;elves to a &s;tate of <HI>abject va&s;&s;allage.</HI></P>
<P>We may not perhaps, ju&s;t now feel any imme|diate ill con&s;equences from this re&s;traint upon our legi&s;lation; but when we are to determine upon the purity or ju&s;tice of any particular act, we are to con&s;ider all the effects which it may probably, or even po&s;&s;ibly produce. Suppo&s;e (for in&s;tance) that our &s;avage neighbours &s;hould once more wantonly invade our frontiers&mdash;to what a hor|rid &s;ituation &s;hould we be reduced! Our lives and fortunes expo&s;ed to the attacks of a barbarous enemy, without our being able to rai&s;e either men or money for our protection. Can the greate&s;t enemy to America think of our being reduced to a &s;ituation &s;o truly di&s;tre&s;sful, without accu&s;ing of the mo&s;t unnatural &s;everity, tho&s;e who arro|gate to them&s;elves an ab&s;olute power of directing and re&s;training our every action, in &s;uch a man|ner
<PB N="10" REF="010986_0010_0F852EFEE7838E08">
as may be&s;t an&s;wer their own partial purpo&s;es? In this amazing exertion of parliamentary power, the &s;ingle colony of New-York is not alone con|cerned. It may hereafter be the fate of every o|ther province, unle&s;s they now cordially unite in &s;uch an application as may confirm their liberty, or e&s;tabli&s;h their &s;ubordination upon &s;ome regular principles.</P>
<P>I am no favourer of violent mea&s;ures. I would endeavour to &s;upport our preten&s;ions by force of rea&s;oning, not by force of arms; but yet I would anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h that nothing may intimidate us in|to an acquie&s;cence with the mea&s;ures of oppre&s;&s;ion. We may be compelled to &s;ubmit, but never to relin|qui&s;h our claim to the privileges of the free-men.</P>
<P>When we complain of the violent proceedings in the late admini&s;trations, let us con&s;ider the al|terations which a century has produced in our con&s;titution. We have now a &s;tanding army of one hundred and twenty regiments. Scarce a fa|mily of rank but what has &s;ome military connec|tions; and even in the hou&s;e of commons there are too many gentlemen of the &s;word. No won|der then, that we are alarmed with &s;uch <HI>&s;pirited re&s;olves</HI>&mdash;that execution is to preceed judgment; and that the inhabitants of a colony are regarded as <HI>dependent va&s;&s;als,</HI> by tho&s;e who have been ac|cu&s;tomed to con&s;ider a legion of <HI>free &s;ubject,</HI> as a band of <HI>ab&s;olute &s;laves</HI>&mdash;points of honour now take place of points in law, and <HI>Magna Char|ta</HI> it&s;elf mu&s;t give way to that <HI>furor militaris</HI> which &s;o univer&s;ally prevails. The hand which be&s;tows a truncheon can never be guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion, and the will of an artful mini&s;ter, will become the law of a whole nation.</P>
<P>I am no enemy to the pre&s;ent military e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, but as I conceive it may influence and en|danger
<PB N="11" REF="010986_0011_0F852F011E634C00">
our liberties; nor have I any re&s;entment again&s;t the inhabitants of that country, which gave birth to my ance&s;tors, but when I con&s;ider them as exerting their &s;uperior power to reduce their fellow &s;ubjects to a &s;tate of &s;ubordination in|con&s;i&s;tent with their natural rights, and not to be reconciled to the &s;pirit of their own con&s;titution. I admire and revere the well regulated government of Great-Britain, and only wi&s;h to have our own &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;o excellent a &s;tandard.</P>
<P>As a coloni&s;t, my mo&s;t ambitious views extend no further than the rights of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject. I cannot comprehend how my being born in Ame|rica &s;hould dive&s;t me of the&s;e; nor can I conceive why the liberty and property of a free born Ame|rican &s;hould not be protected from every inva&s;ion with the &s;ame caution, which has ever been exert|ed to guard the privileges of an Engli&s;hman. If we are entitled to the liberties of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects we ought to enjoy them <HI>unlimitted and unre&s;trained.</HI> If our preten&s;ions to the&s;e are without any foundation, why are we left unacquainted with the cau&s;e and nature of our &s;ubordination? In acts of the greate&s;t &s;olemni|ty and notoriety, we have been flattered with the title of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects&mdash;we have received with the blood of our ance&s;tors, the &s;pirit of liberty, and our hearts naturally retain an utter abhor|rence of &s;lavery. We have carefully examined tho&s;e glorious charters, granted to the virtuous re|&s;olution of our brave fore-fathers; and the re&s;ult of our examination cannot but inform us&mdash;that liberty is only to be &s;upported by a &s;teady op|po&s;ition to the fir&s;t advances of arbitrary power. The conduct of the coloni&s;ts has been mo&s;t mali|ciou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented, and they have been &s;tigma|tized as <HI>riotous</HI> and <HI>rebellious,</HI> when tho&s;e who are un-influenced by prejudice, cannot but di&s;cover
<PB N="12" REF="010986_0012_0F852F01D14A3178">
that their warme&s;t wi&s;hes ri&s;e no higher than to a connection, founded upon <HI>natural right;</HI> and that their pre&s;ent re&s;entment could only be excited by the horrid apprehen&s;ions of being reduced to a &s;tate of <HI>&s;lavi&s;h dependence.</HI></P>
<P>I am not &s;o great a &s;tickler for the indepen|dence of the colonies, but I am ready to acknow|ledge the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of lodging in &s;ome part of the community a <HI>re&s;training</HI> power, for the regulating and limiting the trade and manufactures of each particular county or colony, in &s;uch a manner as might mo&s;t effectually promote the good of the whole; and I &s;hould not ob&s;tinately object to the ve&s;ting this power in the parliament of Great-Britain, if the violent mea&s;ures which have lately been carried into execution, did not afford me too much rea&s;on to believe, that every conce&s;&s;ion which might at this time be made from a <HI>principle of nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> and a regard to the public utility, would be immediately con&s;idered as an acknow|ledgment of &s;uch a <HI>&s;ubordination,</HI> as is totally in|con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of our con&s;titution. If a laudable motive of moderation, and a generous attention to the welfare and tranquility of the whole community, &s;hould induce a ready &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to every regulation which the Briti&s;h parlia|ment may think nece&s;&s;ary to frame, the ill con&s;e|quences which may po&s;&s;ibly attend &s;uch a tempe|rate conduct, may draw upon us, a charge of <HI>un|pardonable negligence.</HI> In a &s;y&s;tem &s;o complicated as ours, where one power is continually encroach|ing upon the other, and where the general ba|lance is &s;o fluctuating and precarious; a &s;pirit of compliance and moderation in the pre&s;ent age, may lay a foundation for the &s;lavery and depen|dence of future generations; who will have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to charge us with having ba&s;ely

<P>In the pur&s;uit of all political mea&s;ures, if we are not cautious in pre&s;erving the <HI>appearance</HI> of liberty, we may in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;e the <HI>reality</HI> it&s;elf. As men attentive to our own particular intere&s;ts, we cannot but di&s;cover the many advantages which the coloni&s;ts would nece&s;&s;arily have over their brethren of <HI>Britain,</HI> in the cour&s;e of a <HI>free unin|terrupted commerce;</HI> but, as men of rea&s;on and integrity, we do not indulge a wi&s;h to enjoy the&s;e advantages at the expence of our fellow &s;ubjects. We &s;hall ever readily &s;ub&s;cribe to &s;uch commerci|al regulations as may enable the inhabitants of Great-Britain, and Ireland, to meet us at all fo|reign markets upon an equal footing; but where the authority by which the&s;e re&s;trictions are to be framed, can with mo&s;t &s;afety and propriety be lodged, is now the &s;ubject of our inquiries.</P>
<P>The bolde&s;t advocates for the power of parlia|ment, cannot, at this day, without blu&s;hing, a&s;|&s;ert, that it is &s;overeign and &s;upreme in every re|&s;pect what&s;oever. That great man, who is, be|yond all contradiction, the be&s;t acquainted with the con&s;titution of his own country, and the mo&s;t &s;incerely attached to her true intere&s;t, never wi&s;hed to extend the legi&s;lative power of Britain, any further than might be e&s;&s;ential to her own pre&s;ervation; by e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch regulations as were indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to prevent her falling a prey to her ri&s;ing colonies. As there was an immediate nece&s;&s;ity of placing this power &s;ome|where, the parliament of Great-Britain could

urge a claim founded in an appearance of rea&s;on, and &s;upported by a &s;uperiority of &s;trength; and yet rea&s;onable as this claim appeared to be, it could never be maintained, upon the principles of their own government. The commons of Britain might indeed with great propriety propo&s;e regulations for the trade, and re&s;trictions for the manufactures of tho&s;e by whom they were ap|pointed; but how they can, with any face of equity, re&s;olve to extend the&s;e regulations and re&s;trictions to tho&s;e from whom they have received no delegated power, is what I cannot easily com|prehend. Would they but admit to their gene|ral council a certain number of deputies, proper|ly authorized from every colony, to &s;upport the intere&s;ts of their con&s;tituents, to explain the na|ture of their &s;ituation, and remon&s;trate again&s;t any acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, then indeed whatever com|mercial regulations they might think proper to form, would be fixed upon a con&s;titutional ba&s;is, and their authority remain for ever undi&s;puted; as I can never be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean that it &s;hould extend to any other than &s;uch matters which im|mediately relate to commerce; while the internal policy of each colony &s;hould &s;till be regulated by its proper repre&s;entatives, in conjunction with the deputy of the crown; and their liberty &s;hould only be re&s;trained and their property fairly di&s;po|&s;ed of by tho&s;e who are legally ve&s;ted with that au|thority. I am very &s;en&s;ible, that to fix a repre|&s;entation in parliament for the purpo&s;es of com|merce only, would be attended with many incon|veniencies; but every man who has the cau&s;e of liberty, and the intere&s;t of his country at heart, would rather accept &s;uch a partial, di&s;advantage|ous e&s;tabli&s;hment as might immediately be obtain|ed, than &s;ubmit to &s;uch an unnatural &s;tate of &s;ub|ordination,

as mu&s;t continually keep alive the &s;pirit of contention, and finally involve us in in|evitable ruin.</P>
<P>The friends of parliamentary power lo&s;e them|&s;elves in contemplating the idol they have rai&s;ed; and to confirm the veneration which they have entertained, they annex to it the idea of omnipo|tence and infallibility. It is a received maxim of the law&mdash;"that the king can do no wrong;" and yet our brave forefathers were not &s;o deluded by this royal dogma as to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;tripped of their invaluable rights and privileges by the arbitrary fiat of a wicked prince; and if they were ju&s;tifiable in their re&s;olute oppo&s;ition to the unwarrantable encroachments of a power which had been con&s;idered as &s;acred. by a long hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; how very rea&s;onably may we conceive that our conduct will be &s;trictly de|fen&s;ible when we unanimou&s;ly oppo&s;e the violent proceedings of a body which we may be &s;aid, from day to day, to have fa&s;hioned with our own hands. As the original design of delegating power, was, that it might be exerci&s;ed for the good of the whole community, there cannot be a greater ab&s;ur|dity in polities, than to &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e whom we have ve&s;ted with a rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary authority, are not accountable to us if they &s;hould by any con&s;ideration, be led weakly and wanton|ly to abu&s;e it. The doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive obedience to the tyrannic will of a wicked prince has long &s;ince been exploded, and tho&s;e who have endeavoured to inculcate the&s;e &s;lavi&s;h principles, have de&s;ervedly been treated with the utmo&s;t rigour of the law.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Sacheverel's trial.</HI></NOTE> If liberty be the object which we pur&s;ue, and &s;lavery the

<P>The natural right which every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, to re&s;train, by every po&s;&s;ible method, the progre&s;s of arbitrary, lawle&s;s government, is not at this day to be controverted; and though it may be in|&s;inuated, that the too warmly and too frequently pre&s;&s;ing this doctrine, may excite a &s;pirit of licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s; yet in an&s;wer to this, I mu&s;t beg leave to remark, that the cau&s;e of liberty cannot be too care|fully cultivated, &amp; that tho&s;e principles by which it is be&s;t &s;upported, cannot be too often or too &s;trongly inculcated. Should the parliament of Britain, by an act of power, atempt to &s;trip their con&s;ti|tuents of &s;ome important, unalienable right; would they not meet with as certain and violent oppo&s;ition, as if the crown, by an exertion of its prerogative, &s;hould endeavour to dive&s;t them of &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed privilege? The King of Great-Britain is ve&s;ted with an exten&s;ive, but not an un|limitted authority; and is him&s;elf bound by tho&s;e laws with the execution of which he is entru&s;ted. The repre&s;entatives of the nation, in parliament a&s;&s;embled, with ju&s;tice arrogate to them&s;elves many great and u&s;eful powers. They are tru&s;tees lawfully appointed for the freemen of Great-Bri|tain&mdash;<HI>nequid detrimenti capiat re&s;publica</HI> is the tenure of their appointment; and if they &s;hould from any principle of venality or corruption, be|tray their important tru&s;t, no man can doubt but that they are very rea&s;onably accountable to their
<PB N="17" REF="010986_0017_0F852F059BC081E8">
con&s;tituents for every part of their mi&s;conduct. Should an act of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature invade the rights of tho&s;e who clothed the law-makers with their legi&s;lative power, it could only be con&s;idered as a breach of tru&s;t; but if the &s;ame authority &s;hould be exerted to deprive us of our mo&s;t ine&s;ti|mable liberties, we mu&s;t very properly regard it as an act of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. Such violence has lately been offered to the legi&s;lature of New-York in particular, and &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion will with great rea&s;on be complained of by the colonies in general, when they more clearly di&s;cover the ill ten|dency of tho&s;e &s;tatutes, which have lately been framed under a pretence of regulating our com|merce. I cannot think it nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a minute examination of every particular &s;tatute. The nature and importance of tho&s;e duties which have been impo&s;ed upon &s;uch articles as we are un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of importing from Great-Britain only, have been very clearly and accurately ex|plained by a late judicious writer.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Author of the Farmer's letters.</HI></NOTE> For my part I have only laboured to impre&s;s the princi|ples of liberty upon the minds of my country|men; and to draw from tho&s;e principles &s;uch clear an forcible conclu&s;ions as might carry with them conviction even to the mo&s;t prejudiced.

<P>The Lords and Commons with the approba|tion of the Crown, agree to regulate their trade by well placed re&s;trictions, and &s;ettle the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of their manufactures in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall be mo&s;t conducive to the public good.

<PB N="20" REF="010986_0020_0F852F07E2FFFDD0">
of ingenious &s;ophi&s;try, that, upon the indi&s;pen|&s;ible principles of their own con&s;titution, the Lords and Commons of <HI>England</HI> can no more <HI>cove|nant</HI> with the Crown for the limitting and re&s;train|ing our natural liberty, than they can <HI>agree</HI> to <HI>give</HI> and <HI>grant</HI> the mo&s;t valuable of our property to be di&s;po&s;ed of for their own private purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The more I con&s;ider this maxim, which I have taken from my Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale,</HI> the more &s;en&s;ible am I of its weight and importance. To perceive its full force, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to look back to the fir&s;t dawn of freedom, when the good people of <HI>England,</HI> would no longer &s;ubmit to have their liberty and property arbitrarily di&s;po&s;ed of by the royal fiat. Con&s;cious of their own im|portance, they, at fir&s;t, only claimed a privilege of recommending by petition, &s;uch mea&s;ures as they might conceive nece&s;&s;ary for the public good. In this humble form did the &s;pirit of liberty fir&s;t appear, while the power of the crown continued for ages almo&s;t unlimitted in its extent, and un|controuled in its opperation. But, when an atten|tion to the true intere&s;ts of the nation, e&s;tabli&s;h|ed their manufactures and extended their com|merce, the common people readily &s;hook off their &s;ervile dependence upon their Lords, and gladly embraced an opportunity of acquiring that afflu|ence of riches which was the firme&s;t foundation of their future liberty. Tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ituation had lately been that of the mo&s;t abject va&s;&s;allage, now &s;uddenly found them&s;elves rai&s;ed, by their own indu&s;try, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth and in|dependence. Proud of &s;uch valuable and impor|tant acqui&s;itions, they only waited for that infor|mation, which was the child of time and experi|ence, to direct their &s;teps in the pur&s;uit of mea&s;ures which were to e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t &s;olid &s;ecurity
<PB N="21" REF="010986_0021_0F852F0897643860">
for that liberty and property which they had &s;o lately acquired.</P>
<P>Before &s;cience extended her happy influence over this ri&s;ing nation, their progre&s;s in the paths of liberty was but &s;low and irregular&mdash;interrupted by events which they were too &s;hort &s;ighted to fore&s;ee, and ob&s;tructed by revolutions which no human prudence could prevent. But, when their acqui&s;ition of knowledge, from a care|ful examination of the pa&s;t, enabled them not on|ly to regulate the pre&s;ent, but even to penetrate into the remote regions of future contingency, every revolving year furni&s;hed them with &s;ome opportunity to improve and enlarge their &s;y&s;tem of liberty. With every a&s;&s;i&s;tance which human wi&s;dom could be&s;tow, &s;upported by the experi|ence of ages, they have at la&s;t fixed the founda|tion of their freedom upon &s;uch principles as will forever &s;tand the te&s;t of the mo&s;t critical exami|nation. Careful to guard tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings for which they had &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly laboured, they e&s;tabli&s;hed this as a fundamental maxim&mdash;that no new regulation could be framed, nor any old law abrogated but by the <HI>general con&s;ent</HI> of the nation. Such a con&s;ent as mu&s;t be evidenced by a majority of votes in the different e&s;tates of the kingdom&mdash;the Lords in their proper per&s;ons a&s;&s;enting, while the &s;en&s;e of the common people is known from the voices of their repre&s;entatives. Can any thing le&s;s than infinite wi&s;dom elaborate a &s;y&s;tem more perfect than that which &s;o effectual|ly &s;ecures the happine&s;s of every individual&mdash;which admits no law as obligatory but upon tho&s;e who are <HI>expre&s;sly parties,</HI> or have actually &s;ub|&s;cribed to the obligation?</P>

<P>I have the highe&s;t veneration for the character and abilities of Mr. Pitt, and &s;carcely dare in|dulge my&s;elf in a train of rea&s;oning, which evi|dently points out to me the mo&s;t &s;triking incon|&s;i&s;tency in the &s;en&s;e of his &s;peech in January, up|on American affairs. From the be&s;t evidence which I am capable of receiving, I cannot but be clearly convinced that our liberty mu&s;t be only ideal, and our privileges chimerical, while the omnipotence of parliament can <Q>bind our trade, confine our manufactures, and exerci&s;e every power whatever except that of taking money out of our pockets without our con&s;ent.</Q> If this &s;overeign power, which they &s;o warmly a&s;&s;ert, &s;hould be once tamely conceded, to what trifling purpo&s;e have we exerted our&s;elves in our glorious oppo&s;ition to the Stamp-act. At be&s;t we have but put the evil day a far off.&mdash;We have not combated the reality, but the mode of oppre&s;&s;ion, we have only gained a temporary reprieve, 'till &s;ome future mini&s;|ter, with as little virtue and more abilities than Mr. G&mdash;, &s;hall think proper to employ this un|bounded legi&s;lative power for the horrid purpo&s;e of reducing three millions of people to a &s;tate of abject &s;lavery.</P>
<P>If our &s;overeign lords, the commons of England, have been led, by their ab&s;urd jealou&s;ly and envious partiality, under the direction of a ra&s;h and impoli|tic mini&s;ter, to &s;trike &s;o bold a &s;troke at both our liberty and property, what danger may we not ap|prehend from the &s;ame &s;elfi&s;h principles, when they may be influenced by the deep laid &s;chemes of &s;ome able &s;tate&s;man?

given up to their &s;pirited oppo&s;ition, the exce&s;s of their joy will not &s;uffer them to indulge any gloomy reflections upon that <HI>dangerous re&s;erve</HI> of <HI>legi&s;la|tion.</HI> The pre&s;ent evil averted, the warmth of their &s;anguine di&s;po&s;itions will not allow them to think that oppre&s;&s;ion may return at any other time, or in any other form. Their very gratitude and humility prevent their enquiring into a cau&s;e of the la&s;t importance. In the highe&s;t exultation of heart at a conce&s;&s;ion &s;carcely expected, they re|ceive as a matter of <HI>favour</HI> what they demanded as a matter of <HI>right,</HI> and, to avoid an appearance of arrogance in urging any new demands, they neglect the di&s;charge of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential duties to them&s;elves and their po&s;terity. Perhaps they will &s;carcely thank the man who &s;hall endeavour to convince them, that the &s;imple power of legi&s;|lation may as effectually ruin the colonies as that of taxation.</P>
<P>Let us borrow and improve upon a thought of our greate&s;t enemy. Mr. G&mdash;tells us that <HI>in|ternal</HI> and <HI>external taxes</HI> are the &s;ame in <HI>effect,</HI> and differ but in name. Mr. Pitt has indeed treated this opinion with &s;o little attention, that he has only an&s;wered it by a general a&s;&s;ertion, that <HI>there is a plain di&s;tinction between taxes levied for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, and duties impo&s;ed for the regulation of trade.</HI></P>
<P>Plain as this di&s;tinction is, my mo&s;t indu&s;trious enquiries have not yet led me to it; and I can|not but think with Mr. G&mdash;, that they are the &s;ame <HI>in effect.</HI>&mdash;The one is preci&s;ely determined, while the other is more uncertain and eventual; but, in proportion to the &s;um rai&s;ed, the effect will be exactly the &s;ame. It is taken for granted that the collection of a &s;tamp duty would drain
<PB N="29" REF="010986_0029_0F852F11ADC8D728">
us of all the &s;pecie which we receive as a balance in our We&s;t-India trade. If any exorbitant duty laid upon &s;ugar and mola&s;&s;es produces the &s;ame effect, in what does the difference con&s;i&s;t? By either means the trea&s;ury of England will be en|riched with the whole profit of our labour, and we our&s;elves &s;hall be reduced to that deplorable &s;tate of poverty, of which we have, at this very moment, a mo&s;t affecting in&s;tance. General as the calamity is now become, there are few &s;o un|informed as not to know that the power of legi&s;la|tion has done all this mi&s;chief, without any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from that of taxation. The &s;evere re&s;tric|tions impo&s;ed upon our trade, have made it im|practicable for us to an&s;wer every foreign demand, and, at the &s;ame time re&s;erve a &s;ufficient &s;tock to keep up that circulation of property &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the well being of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Involved in heavy debts, without any pro&s;pect of di&s;charging them&mdash;in want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, without the means of acquiring them, the very politic Mr. G&mdash;has furni&s;hed us with the mo&s;t intere&s;ting facts to prove the truth of his doctrine. As great an enemy as he may be to the colonies, he has at lea&s;t kindly be&s;towed upon them the mo&s;t irrefragable proof that internal and external taxes are the &s;ame in effect; and that they may be as effectually ruined by the powers of le|gi&s;lation as by tho&s;e of taxation.</P>
<P>When the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> arrogate to them&s;elves this &s;overeign juri&s;diction over the colonies, I &s;hould be glad to know on what prin|ciples they found their claim. Do they ground their preten&s;ions on the excellent principles of their own con&s;titution, or is this &s;uprema|cy a power <HI>virtually inherent</HI> in the name of
<PB N="30" REF="010986_0030_0F852F125E4724F8">
parliament? A name which &s;hould remind them of their original &s;tate of humility, when the di&s;tingui&s;hing power which they boa&s;ted was priviledge of <HI>&s;peaking their mind</HI> and remon|&s;trating their grievances. The Lords indeed may, with &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on, a&s;&s;ert a &s;upreme juri&s;diction over the whole body of the nation, as the highe&s;t court of judicature: But when an a&s;piring member of the Commons Hou&s;e confi|dently declares that he has a power to bind our trade, and re&s;train our manufactures, I &s;hould be glad to know whether he derived this power from the hone&s;t freemen his con&s;tituents, or whether he acquired it by virtue of his office? From his con&s;tituents he could receive no more power than they <HI>naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed;</HI> and, from his office he cannot rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed ve&s;ted with any other authority, than that of deciding upon the formalities, and punctilios annexed to it.</P>
<P>To gra&s;p at a juri&s;diction &s;o infinitely exten&s;ive, and &s;o little capable of limitation, is expre&s;sly de|claring, that, from the antiquity of their e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, they are become &s;overeigns of the new-di&s;covered world. Upon &s;uch arbitrary principles mu&s;t they ground their unrea&s;onable preten&s;ions; &s;ince no man in his &s;en&s;es will a&s;&s;ert that an inhabitant of <HI>Birmingham</HI> or <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> has a <HI>natural right,</HI> after having obtained the con|&s;ent of the Crown, to re&s;train, and prevent an indu&s;trious &s;ettler of the colonies from engaging in tho&s;e particular manufactures which may inter|fere with the bu&s;ine&s;s of his own profe&s;&s;ion. Ab|&s;urd as this a&s;&s;ertion is, either this mu&s;t be main|tained, or one full as pregnant with ab&s;urdity; &s;ince one may with as much rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;e this <HI>natural &s;uperiority</HI> in the freemen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>

as this <HI>acquired &s;overeignty</HI> in the collective body of their repre&s;entatives. Whatever rea&s;ons they may devi&s;e to &s;upport this extraordinary claim, the motives to their u&s;urpation are clearly evinced in that part of Mr. Pitt's &s;peech, where he &s;ays&mdash;<Q>if the legi&s;lative power of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> over <HI>America</HI> cea&s;es to be &s;overeign and &s;upreme, I would advi&s;e every gentleman to &s;ell his lands and embark for that country.</Q> A jealous fear, that, from the many natural advantages which we po&s;&s;e&s;s, we may, in &s;ome future age, rival our envious brethren in &s;trength and riches, has urg|ed them to exerci&s;e a piece of Ottoman policy, by &s;trangling us in our infancy. When we exa|mine into the nature of tho&s;e fears which have already proved &s;o fatal to our intere&s;t, the &s;lighte&s;t examination &s;hews them as contemptible and ill-grounded as were ever entertained by the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h of mankind.</P>
<P>Had not this refined policy of our <HI>Briti&s;h Ma|chiavel</HI> interfered, and rou&s;ed us to attention, we &s;hould, in all human probability, have continued for many centuries the faithful drudges of our indulgent mother; and <HI>Great-Britain</HI> would have increa&s;ed in &s;trength and riches in proportion to the population of her colonies. While our com|merce continued unre&s;trained we &s;hould indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly have cultivated every branch of it, that we might be enabled to pay punctually to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that balance which would every year increa&s;e; &s;ince our attention to the &s;ettling an immea&s;ura|ble extent of country, would effectually prevent our e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch manufactories as would fur|ni&s;h us with the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>Had I &s;ufficient information to enter into a minute detail of facts, I believe it would be no

difficult matter to prove, that, in the cour&s;e of our mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful commerce, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> receives nine-tenths of the profit, whil&s;t we are humbly contented with being well fed and clothed as the wages of our labour.</P>
<P>If this inferiority be the con&s;equence of a rea|&s;onable connection, why would they wi&s;h to re|duce us to a &s;tate of abject dependence? Or, if with the advantages which they already po&s;&s;e&s;s, a fair unlimited trade would bring into their hands all the &s;pecie which we could draw from the We&s;t-Indies, why would they wantonly u&s;e &s;uch dete&s;t|able mea&s;ures as they have lately pur&s;ued, to ef|fect the &s;ame purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>If the pre&s;ent &s;evere &s;y&s;tem of politics be the re&s;ult of unrea&s;onable jealou&s;y; I will venture to a&s;&s;ert that this very policy will counteract its own intention. Their di&s;tre&s;&s;es fir&s;t led the colo|ni&s;ts into enquiries concerning the nature of their political &s;ituation, and the ju&s;tice of the treatment which they had received. That ignorance which has kept them in a &s;tate of peaceable &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, fled before their eager re&s;earches after that information which was &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of their liberty. Enraged to find, that, while they had been amu&s;ed with the &s;pecious title of fellow &s;ubjects, and flattered with the rights of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> freemen, they were in reality treated as infants in policy, who&s;e every motion was to be directed by the arbitrary will of their jealous parent; when every &s;uch direction evi|dently tended to reduce the one to an abject &s;tate of dependence, and to rai&s;e the other to the mo&s;t <HI>exalted &s;uperiority.</HI> That both the&s;e purpo&s;es could ea&s;ily have been obtained, by mea&s;ures art|fully managed, is not to be doubted, &s;ince no|thing

<P>THE advocates for the &s;overeignty of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> enumerate among&s;t the other obli|gations by which we are bound, the favours which &s;he has con&s;tantly conferred. If we could rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e a whole political body actuated by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions which may influence an indi|vidual, then, indeed there would be &s;ome foun|dation for our grateful acknowledgements; but when we plainly perceive that the bounties which <HI>Great-Britain</HI> is &s;aid &s;o lavi&s;hly to have be&s;towed upon us, are meted out in the common political mea&s;ure, with an evident intention <HI>finally to pro|mote her own particular benefit,</HI> we can only &s;ay that her actions are the re&s;ult of good policy, not of great genero&s;ity. As for the &s;upport which
<PB N="34" REF="010986_0034_0F852F1A48017810">
they have given us in times of danger, if it did not immediately ari&s;e from the &s;ame motive which has produced their other favours, I am &s;till ama|zed that it &s;hould even be mentioned by tho&s;e who have lavi&s;hed &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure, for the maintenance of an <HI>imaginary balance,</HI> or in de|fending tho&s;e who never thanked them for their defence.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;uperficial examination mu&s;t &s;erve to convince us that the battles of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> could no where have been fought with &s;o much advan|tage as in the woods of America; where her troops could be &s;upplied with all the nece&s;&s;aries of life upon the ea&s;ie&s;t terms, and, from whence all the money which they expended immediately re|turned in immen&s;e payments for the extraordi|nary importations of her manufacture which the exigencies of the war required. Thus were the whole expences of the <HI>American</HI> war very far from le&s;&s;ening the &s;trength or riches of the na|tion; while her forces, which were not &s;ufficient to make a con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion upon the body of her natural enemy, were enabled to lop off one of its limbs. In affecting this glorious purpo&s;e, I will venture to mention the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they received from the provincial troops, as an aid of more importance than is generally allowed. I will even take the liberty to a&s;&s;ert, that the colo|ni&s;ts, in proportion to their <HI>real ability,</HI> did more for the general cau&s;e than could rea&s;onably have been expected, if not more than <HI>Great-Britain</HI> her&s;elf. This a&s;&s;ertion I fancy will gain more eredit now than it would have gained &s;ome time ago; &s;ince the eyes of the world are at la&s;t open, and they mu&s;t if they are not wilfully blind, plainly di&s;cover, that the e&s;timates of our wealth which have been received from ignorant or prejudiced

per&s;ons, are, in every calculation, gro&s;ly errone|ous. The&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations, which have been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, are very po&s;&s;ibly the off&s;pring of political invention, as they form the be&s;t apology for impo&s;ing upon us burthens to which we are altogether unequal. The ea&s;y faith which every ab&s;urd information obtained, and the preci|pitate mea&s;ures, which were the con&s;equence of this unrea&s;onable credulity, mu&s;t &s;ufficiently con|vince us, that while we are within the reach of parliamentary power, we &s;hall not be &s;uffered to riot in a &s;uperfluity of wealth, or to acquire any dangerous degree of &s;trength. Whatever advan|tages may hereafter pre&s;ent them&s;elves, from an increa&s;ed population or more extended trade, we &s;hall never be able to cultivate them to any valua|ble purpo&s;e; for, how much &s;oever we may po&s;|&s;e&s;s the ability of acquiring wealth and indepen|dence, the partial views of our &s;elfi&s;h brethren, &s;upported by the &s;overeignty of parliament, will mo&s;t effectually prevent our enjoying &s;uch invalu|able acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>If any alternation in our &s;y&s;tem of agriculture &s;hould furni&s;h us with a &s;ufficiency of the nece&s;|&s;ary articles for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the mo&s;t valuable manufactories, and an increa&s;e of popu|lation &s;hould enable us to carry them to the great|e&s;t advantage; the manufacturers of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> jealous of &s;uch a formidable encroachment, would ea&s;ily obtain the interpo&s;ition of our &s;overeign directors; who would very naturally ordain, that we &s;hould export our unwrought materials to be laboured by our more &s;kilful brethren, and di&s;|patch our &s;uperfluous inhabitants in &s;earch of a|nother vacant world: And, if the extent of our commerce &s;hould draw into our hands the

<P>The mea&s;ures which have already been pur&s;ued, almo&s;t give to conjecture the force of conviction; &s;ince no man can have been &s;o inattentive to the mo&s;t intere&s;ting facts as not to know, that the power of parliament exerted in the &s;ingle in&s;tance or re&s;training our trade, has already reduced us to <HI>inconceiveable di&s;tre&s;s.</HI> Denied the means of acquiring &s;pecie &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of a general circulation, and limitted in the emi&s;&s;ion of our paper currency, men of con&s;iderable real e&s;tates become unable to an&s;wer the mo&s;t trifling demands; and, when urged by creditors, per|haps as much perplexed as them&s;elves, their lands are &s;old by execution for le&s;s than half their for|mer value. This, as one of the mo&s;t &s;triking in|conveniences, attending the late un&s;ea&s;onable exertion of parliamentary power. I have &s;elected for ob&s;ervation, from a very exten&s;ive catalogue of grievances which it has already produced, and of which we are at this moment mo&s;t &s;everely &s;en&s;ible. I am led to a choice of this particular fact, from a con&s;ideration of the fatal con&s;e|quence by which it may po&s;&s;ibly be attended, &s;hould the merchants of England immediately demand a rigid payment of the general balance due to them. It is not an ea&s;y matter to conceive how much our property may be affected by &s;o un|&s;ea&s;onable a demand; &s;ince the calamity would by a regular connection, extend from the lowe&s;t to

<P>From the&s;e re&s;olves we may very rea&s;onably &s;up|po&s;e, that the repeal is more immediately found|ed upon the <HI>inexpediency</HI> of the act, than upon a conviction that they had exerted an <HI>uncon&s;tituti|onal power.</HI> Had they been willing to allow this act as inva&s;ive of an indi&s;putable right, they would not &s;o &s;everely have cen&s;ured us for our daring oppo&s;ition, and lavi&s;hed &s;uch prai&s;es upon tho&s;e who&s;e &s;elfi&s;h views or &s;lavi&s;h principles made them &s;o readily &s;ub&s;cribe to the infallibility and omni|potence of parliament.&mdash;A peaceable &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to the fir&s;t attacks of encroaching power, is altogether incompatible with the genius of liber|ty! nor could it rea&s;onably be expected, that in &s;uch a &s;udden and dangerous inva&s;ion of our mo&s;t ine&s;timable rights, the form of oppo&s;ition could be perfectly model'd by the hand of prudence. Violent and precipitate as our mea&s;ures were, they wanted nothing but &s;ucce&s;s to &s;anctify them; &s;ince the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver cannot but have di&s;|covered, that in the political world, right and wrong are merely <HI>arbitrary modes,</HI> totally depen|dent upon the ri&s;e and fall of contending parties.</P>

with the tyrannic conduct of a weak prince, made the bolde&s;t &s;truggles for the &s;upport of their langui&s;hing liberty, in their fir&s;t ill directed ef|forts under the unfortunate <HI>Monmouth.</HI> The ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e could not &s;ave them from the pains and penalties of <HI>open rebellion:</HI> But when a prince of military abilities gave them his powerful a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, they &s;uddenly effected the pre&s;ervation of their freedom, and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;o important an event by the title of <HI>a glorious revolution;</HI> &s;o much influence has &s;ucce&s;s, in rating the merit of our political conduct.</P>
<P>When the committee of the hou&s;e re&s;olve in the mo&s;t general and expre&s;&s;ive terms, that the authority of parliament over the colonies is <HI>&s;o|vereign and &s;upreme in every re&s;pect whatever,</HI> there is no rea&s;oning again&s;t &s;o formidable a re&s;o|lution, &s;upported by the power of the whole king|dom. We can only remark that the &s;ame hou&s;e heretofore re&s;olved to take under their own par|ticular direction, the rights of the people, the privileges of the lords, and the &s;overeignty of the crown; and, for a long time maintained this un|natural u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>If they did not &s;uffer the pa&s;&s;ions of the man to influence the judgment of the Senator, they would never treat that as a point of honour which &s;hould only be con&s;idered as a matter of right.</P>
<P>If, upon a cool, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enquiry, it may ap|pear, that the Commons of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have no <HI>natural or acquired &s;uperiority</HI> over the free|men of <HI>America,</HI> they will certainly do us the ju&s;|tice to acknowledge this very rea&s;onable indepen|dence, and not wickedly endeavour to en&s;lave millions to promote the honour and dignity of a few ambitious individuals.</P>
<P>In &s;upporting this doctrine of independence, I

have e&s;tabli&s;hed as an incontrovertible truth, this very accurate definition of my Lord C. J. <HI>Hale</HI>&mdash;That every act of parliament is a <HI>tripartite in|denture of agreement between the three e&s;tates of the kingdom.</HI> If this maxim be not di&s;putable I very humbly conceive, that every con&s;equence which I have drawn from it, is fairly and logically deduced; for it cannot, but with the mo&s;t glaring ab&s;urdity, be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the parties to the&s;e political agreements may legally bind tho&s;e who are not in any wi&s;e privy to them.</P>
<P>The very &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution requires, that general regulations framed for the government of &s;ociety, mu&s;t have the &s;anction of <HI>general approbation;</HI> and, that no man &s;hall be deprived of life, liberty or property, but by the force of tho&s;e laws to which he has voluntarily &s;ub&s;cribed. The&s;e principles once acknowledged as the foundation of Engli&s;h liberty, how can the coloni&s;ts be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>natural rights of mankind,</HI> or the <HI>peculiar privileges of Engli&s;hmen,</HI> while they are every day liable to receive laws framed by per&s;ons ignorant of their abilities&mdash;unacquainted with their nece&s;&s;ities, and evidently influenced by partial motives? If my zeal for the good of my country has not greatly clouded my judgment, I &s;till dare &s;o far depend upon the prin|ciples which I have e&s;tabli&s;hed, as to a&s;&s;ert, that, while the power of the Briti&s;h parliament is ac|knowledged <HI>&s;overeign and &s;upreme in every re|&s;pect what&s;oever,</HI> the liberty of <HI>America</HI> is no more than a flattering dream, and her privileges delu|&s;ive &s;hadows.</P>
<P>While I relate matters of fact, from the be&s;t evidence which I am capable of receiving, if I have mi&s;repre&s;ented them, I lie open to contra|diction;

and, when I recapitulate the principles from which I have drawn my train of rea&s;oning, I am not &s;o ob&s;tinately attached to my own opinion as to be proof again&s;t conviction. If I am guilty of any errors in the cour&s;e of this unconnected performance, they mu&s;t be attributed to my not having received &s;ufficient information, or to my want of ability in u&s;ing the materials which I had acquired. I have never wilfully mi&s;repre&s;ented a fact, nor de&s;ignedly drawn from it a falacious con&s;equence. I have not laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h any favourite &s;y&s;tem, and, with the vanity of a pro|jector, &s;upported it at the expence of my veracity.</P>
<P>But however trifling this performance my ap|pear, both my head and my heart have co-ope|rated in its production, and I really &s;at down <Q>to write what I thought, not to think what I &s;hould write</Q></P>
