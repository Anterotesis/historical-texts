<HEAD>THE REMARKABLE ADVENTURES OF JACKSON JOHONNET.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is &s;eldom a more difficult ta&s;k under|taken by man, than the act of writing a narra|tive of a per&s;on's own life; e&s;pecially where the inci|dents border on the marvellous. Prodigies but &s;el|dom happen, and the veracity of relaters of them is &s;till le&s;s frequently vouched for; however, as the di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence towards me have been too &s;triking not to make a deep and grateful impre&s;&s;ion, and as the principal part of them can be atte&s;ted to by living evidences, I &s;hall proceed, being confident that the candid reader will pardon the inaccuracies of an illiterate &s;oldier, and that the tender hearted will drop the tear of &s;ympathy, when they realize the idea of the &s;ufferings of &s;uch of our unfortunate country folks as fall into the hands of the we&s;tern Indians, who&s;e tender mercies are cruelties.</P>
<P>I was born and brought up at Falmouth, Ca&s;cobay, where I re&s;ided until I attained to the &s;eventeenth year of my age. My parents were poor, the farm we oc|cupied &s;mall and hard to cultivate, their family large and expen&s;ive, and every way fitted to &s;pare me to &s;eek a &s;eparate fortune; at lea&s;t the&s;e ideas had gain|ed &s;o great an a&s;cendancy in my mind that I deter|mined, with the con&s;ent of my parents, to look out for means of &s;upporting my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="025665_0003_0FCEBB777926C0A8">Having fixed on the matter firmly, I took leave of my friends and &s;ailed on the 1&s;t of May, 1791, on board a coa&s;ting &s;chooner for Bo&s;ton. Being arrived in this capital, and entirely out of employ, I had many unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, and more than once &s;incerely wi&s;hed my&s;elf at home with my parents; however, as I had &s;et out on an important de&s;ign, and as yet met with no misfortune, pride kept me from this act, while nece&s;&s;ity urged me to fix &s;peedily on &s;ome mode of obtaining a livelihood.</P>
<P>My mind was &s;everely agitated on this &s;ubject one morning, when a young officer came into my room, and &s;oon entered into conver&s;ation on the plea&s;ures of a military life, the great chance there was for an active young man to obtain promotion, and the grand pro&s;pect opening for making great fortunes in the we&s;tern country. His artifice had the de&s;ired effect; for after treating me with a bowl or two of punch, I enli&s;ted, with a firm promi&s;e on his &s;ide to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in obtaining a &s;erjeant's warrant before the party left Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>An entire new &s;cene now opened before me; in&s;tead becoming a &s;erjeant, I was treated &s;everely for my ignorance in a matter I had until then &s;carcely thought it, and in&s;ultingly ridiculed for remon&s;trating again&s;t the conduct of the officer. I &s;uffered great unea&s;ine&s;s on the&s;e and other accounts of a &s;imilar kind, for &s;ome time; at length, convinced of the futility of complaint, I applied my&s;elf to &s;tudy the exerci&s;e, and in a few days became tolerably expert. The begin|ning of July we left Bo&s;ton, and proceeded on our way to join the we&s;tern army. When we arrived at Fort Wa&s;hington I was ordered to join Capt. Phelon's company, and in a few days &s;et out on the expedition under General Harmar. Tho&s;e alone who have ex|perienced, can tell what hard&s;hips men undergo in &s;uch excur&s;ions; hunger, fatigue and toil were our
<PB N="5" REF="025665_0004_0FCEBB7AC7E40500">
con&s;tant attendants; however, as our expectations were rai&s;ed with the idea of ea&s;y conque&s;t, rich plun|der, and fine farms in the end, we made a &s;hift to be tolerably merry: For my own part, I had obtained a &s;erjeancy, and flattered my&s;elf I was in the direct road to honour, fame and fortune. Alas! how fluctuating are the &s;cenes of life! how &s;ingularly precarious the fortune of a &s;oldier! before a &s;ingle opportunity pre|&s;ented in which I could have a chance to &s;ignalize my&s;elf, it was my lot to be taken in an ambu&s;cade, by a party of Kickapoo Indians, and with ten others con&s;trained to experience &s;cenes, in compari&s;on of which our former di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;unk into nothing. We were taken on the banks of the Waba&s;h, and imme|diately conveyed to the upper Miami, at lead &s;uch of us as &s;urvived. The &s;econd day after we were taken, one of my companions, by the name of George Ai|kins, a native of Ireland, became &s;o faint with hunger and fatigue that he could proceed no further; a &s;hort council was immediately held among the Indians who guarded us, the re&s;ult of which was that he &s;hould be put to death: This was no &s;ooner determined on, than a &s;cene of horror began: The captain of the guard approached the victim, who lay bound upon the ground, and with his knife made a circular inci&s;ion on the &s;kull; two others immediately pulled off the &s;calp; after this they each of them &s;truck him on the head with their tomahawks; they then &s;tripped him naked, &s;tabbed him with their knives in every &s;en&s;i|tive part of the body, and left him weltering in blood, though not quite dead, a wretched victim to Indian rage and helli&s;h barbarity.</P>
<P>We were eight days on our march to the upper Mi|ami, during which painful travel, no pen can de&s;cribe our &s;ufferings from hunger, thir&s;t, and toil. We were met at the entrance of the town by above five hun|dred Indians, be&s;ides &s;quaws and children, who ap|proached
<PB N="6" REF="025665_0005_0FCEBB7BF38EB718">
by a mo&s;t hideous yelling made by our guard, and an&s;wered repeatedly from the village.&mdash; Here we were all &s;everely beaten by the Indians, and four of our number, viz. James Durgee, of Concord, Samuel For&s;ythe, of Beverly, Robert Deloy, of Mar|blehead, and Uzza Benton, of Salem, who all faint|ed under their heavy trials, were &s;calped and toma|hawked in our pre&s;ence, and tortured to death with every inflicted mi&s;ery that Indian ingenuity could in|vent.</P>
<P>It was the 4th of Augu&s;t when we were taken, and our unhappy companions were ma&s;&s;acred the 13th. News was that day received of the de&s;truction of L'Anguille, &amp;c. by General Harmar, numbers of &s;calps were exhibited by the warriors, and &s;everal pri&s;oners, among whom were three women and &s;ix children, carried through the village, de&s;tined to a Kickapoo &s;ettlement further we&s;tward. The fifteenth of Augu&s;t four more of my fellow pri&s;oners, viz. Lemuel Saunders, of Bo&s;ton, Thomas Thap, of Dor|che&s;ter, Vincent Upham, of Mi&s;tic, and Younglove Croxall, of Abington, were taken from us, but wheth|er they were ma&s;&s;acred or pre&s;erved alive, I am una|ble to &s;ay. After this nothing material occurred for a fortnight, except that we were &s;everal times &s;everely whipped on the receipt of bad news, and our allow|ance of provi&s;ions le&s;&s;ened, &s;o that we did not fall an immediate &s;acrifice to the fire or tomahawk, but Heav|en had otherwi&s;e decreed.</P>
<P>On the night following the 30th of Augu&s;t, our guard, which con&s;i&s;ted of four Indians, tired out with watching, laid down to &s;leep, leaving only an old &s;quaw to attend to us; Providence &s;o ordered that my companion had by &s;ome means got one of his hands at liberty, and having a knife in his pocket, &s;oon cut the withes that bound his feet, and that which pin|ioned my arms, unperceived of the old &s;quaw, who
<PB N="7" REF="025665_0006_0FCEBB7D6C31D3D8">
&s;at in a drow&s;y po&s;ition, not &s;u&s;pecting harm, over a &s;mall fire in the wigwam.</P>
<P>I ruminated but a few moments on our &s;ituation; there was no weapon near us, except my companion's knife, which he &s;till held; I looked on him to make him ob&s;erve me, and the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;prang and gra&s;ped the &s;quaw by the throat to prevent her making a noi&s;e, and my comrade in a moment di&s;patched her for the world of &s;pirits. He then &s;eized a tomahawk, and my&s;elf a rifle, and &s;triking at the &s;ame in&s;tant, di&s;patched two of our enemies; the &s;ound of the&s;e blows awakened the others, but before they had time to ri&s;e, we renewed our &s;trokes on them, and luckily to &s;o good effect as to &s;tun them, and then repeating the blow we &s;unk a tomahawk in each of their heads, armed our&s;elves completely, and taking what provi|&s;ions the wigwam afforded, we committed our&s;elves to the protection of Providence, and made the be&s;t of our way into the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The compa&s;s of a volume would &s;carce contain the events of our progre&s;s through the wilderne&s;s, but as they were intere&s;ting to none but us, I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve generally, that the difficulties of the journey were too great to have been endured by any who had le&s;s intere&s;t than life at &s;take, or a le&s;s terrible enemy than Indians to fear. Hunger, thir&s;t and fatigue were our con&s;tant companions, and of a truth we could de|clare that weari&s;ome nights were appointed unto us: We travelled hard day and night, except the few hours ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for repo&s;e, that nature might not &s;ink under her oppre&s;&s;ion, at which period one con&s;tantly watched while the other &s;lept. In this tire&s;ome mode we proceeded until the 15th of Septem|ber, having often to &s;hift our direction on account of impa&s;&s;able bogs, deep mora&s;&s;es and hideous precipices, without meeting any adventure worthy note. On the morning of the 15th, as we were &s;teering nearly a
<PB N="8" REF="025665_0007_0FCEBB7F0530EB20">
north cour&s;e in order to avoid a bog that intercepted our cour&s;e S. E. we found the bodies of one old man, a woman and two children newly murdered, &s;tript and &s;calped. This horrid &s;pectacle chilled our blood; we viewed the wretched victims, and from what we could collect from circum&s;tances, we concluded that they had been dragged away from their homes, and their feet being worn out, had been murdered inhumanly and left weltering in their blood. We were at a great lo&s;s now to determine what cour&s;e to &s;teer; at length we pitched on a direction about northwe&s;t, and walked on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape the &s;avages, if practicable. About noon this day we came to a good &s;pring, which was a great relief to us, but which we had great rea&s;on, a few minutes after, to believe would be the la&s;t of our earthly comforts. My companion, Richard Sackville, a corporal of Capt. Newman's company, &s;tepped a&s;ide into a thicket on &s;ome occa|&s;ion, and returned with the account that a few rods di&s;tant he had di&s;covered four Indians with two mi&s;|erable wretches bound, &s;itting under a tree, eating; and that if I would join him, he would either relieve the captives or peri&s;h in the attempt: The re&s;olution of my worthy comrade plea&s;ed me greatly; and as no time was to be lo&s;t, we &s;at immediately about the ex|ecution of our de&s;ign: Sackville took the lead, and conducted me, undi&s;covered, within fifty yards of the Indians. Two of them were laid down, with their mu&s;kets in their arms, and appeared to be a&s;leep; the others &s;at at the head of the pri&s;oners, their mu&s;kets re&s;ting again&s;t their left &s;houlders, and in their right hands each of them a tomahawk, over the head of their pri&s;oners: We each cho&s;e our man to fire at, and, taking aim deliberately, had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee them both fall; the others in&s;tantly &s;tarted, and &s;eem|ing at a lo&s;s to determine from whence the a&s;&s;ault was made, fell on their bellies, and looked carefully around,
<PB N="9" REF="025665_0008_0FCEBB806B1E1DD0">
to di&s;cover the be&s;t cour&s;e to take; meantime we had re-charged, and &s;hifting our po&s;ition a little, im|patiently waited their ri&s;ing; in a minute they rai&s;ed on their hands and knees, and having, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, di&s;covered the &s;moke of our guns ri&s;ing above the bu&s;hes, attempted to crawl into the thicket on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. This gave us a good chance, and we again fired, at different men, and with &s;uch effect that we brought them both down; one lay motionle&s;s, the other crawled along a few yards; we loaded in an in|&s;tant, and ru&s;hed towards him, yet keeping an eye on him, as he had reached his comrade's gun, and &s;at up|right in a po&s;ture of defence. By our noi&s;e in the bu&s;hes he di&s;covered the direction to fire; alas! too fatally, for by his fatal &s;hot I lo&s;t my faithful comrade and friend Sackville. At this moment the two pri&s;|oners, who were clo&s;e pinioned, endeavoured to make their e&s;cape towards me, but the de&s;perate &s;avage again fired, and &s;hot one of them dead; the other gained the thicket within a few yards of me: I had now once more got ready to fire, and di&s;charged at the wounded Indian; at this di&s;charge I wounded him in the neck, from whence I perceived the blood to flow &s;wiftly, but he yet undauntedly kept his &s;eat, and having new charged his guns, fired upon us with them both, and then fell, &s;eemingly from faintne&s;s and lo&s;s of blood. I ran in&s;tantly to the pinioned white man, and having unbound his arms, and armed him with the unfortunate Sackville's mu&s;ket, we cautiou&s;ly ap|proached a few yards nearer the wounded Indian, when I ordered my new comrade to fire, and we could per|ceive the &s;hot took effect, yet the &s;avage lay motion|le&s;s. As &s;oon as my companion had re-loaded, we approached the Indian, whom we found not quite dead, and a tomahawk in each hand, which he flour|i&s;hed at us, &s;eemingly determined not to be taken alive. I felt for my own part determined to take him
<PB N="10" REF="025665_0009_0FCEBB81F5474070">
alive, if po&s;&s;ible, but my new comrade prevented me by &s;hooting him through the body. I now inquired of my new companion what cour&s;e we ought to &s;teer, and whence the party came, from who&s;e power I had relieved him; he informed me with re&s;pect to the cour&s;e, which we immediately took, and on the way let me know that we were within about three days march of Fort Jeffer&s;on; that he and three others were taken by a party of ten Waba&s;h Indians four days before, in the neighbourhood of that fort; that two of his companions, being wounded, were immediately &s;calped and killed; that the party, at the time of taking him, had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;even other pri&s;on|ers, three of whom were committed to the charge of a party of four Indians; what became of them he knew not; the others being worn down with fatigue, were ma&s;&s;acred the day before, and which I found to be tho&s;e who&s;e bodies poor Sackville di&s;covered in the thicket; that the other two Indians were gone to|wards the &s;ettlements, having &s;worn to kill certain per|&s;ons who&s;e names he had forgotten, and that de&s;truc|tion &s;eemed to be their whole drift.</P>
<P>My comrade, who&s;e name on inquiry I found to be Gregory Sexton, formerly a re&s;ident of Newport, Rhode-I&s;land, I found to be an excellent wood&s;man, and a man of great &s;pirit, and &s;o grateful for the de|liverance I had been in&s;trumental in obtaining for him, that he would not &s;uffer me to watch for him to &s;leep, but one hour in the four and twenty, although he was &s;o fatigued as to have ab&s;olute need of a much greater proportion; neither would he permit me to carry any of our baggage.</P>
<P>From the time of being joined by Sexton, we &s;teer|ed a S. E. cour&s;e, as direct as po&s;&s;ible, until the 18th towards night, directing our cour&s;e by the &s;un and the mo&s;s on the trees by day, and the moon by night; on the evening of the 18th, we providentially fell in
<PB N="11" REF="025665_0010_0FCEBB8393F85DA0">
with an American &s;couting party, who conducted us &s;afely, in a few hours, to Fort Jeffer&s;on, where we were treated with great humanity, and &s;upplied with the be&s;t refre&s;hments the fort afforded, which to me was very acceptable, as I had not ta&s;ted any thing, except wild berries and ground nuts, for above a week.</P>
<P>This fort is &s;ituated in a fertile country, within a few miles of the &s;pot where Braddock's defeat took place. I walked over the ground where the action happened, a few days after our arrival at Fort Jeffer|&s;on, and viewed it very attentively; having a com|panion with me who was able to de&s;cribe the differ|ent po&s;itions of the Engli&s;h army on that very unhap|py day. In many places we ob&s;erved human bones &s;trewed on the ground, which remained uncon&s;umed, and excited melancholy &s;en&s;ations. Many of the trees around &s;till &s;hew the &s;cars of balls which grazed them in the action. Alas! how little did I think at the time of viewing the&s;e things, that an army of Americans, nearly equal in number to general Brad|dock's, was de&s;tined in a few days to experience a &s;im|ilar defeat, and fly acro&s;s this melancholy &s;pot: This however was the ca&s;e, and my&s;elf, &s;o often in danger, and &s;o repeatedly the &s;ubject of &s;ignal deliverances, was by de&s;tiny to be an actor in the tremendous &s;cene; and once more, almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly, to e&s;cape alive, while death, in its mo&s;t dreadful &s;hape, appear|ed in every direction, and &s;eemed to be in&s;atiable in his de&s;ire of victims.</P>
<P>The week after our arrival at Fort Jeffer&s;on, I was able to return to my own regiment, which, the latter end of October, joined the we&s;tern army, on an expe|dition again&s;t the Indians of the Miami Village, the place in which I had &s;uffered &s;o much, and &s;o recently, and where I had beheld &s;o many cruelties perpetrated on the unfortunate Americans. It is ea&s;ier to con|ceive than de&s;cribe the perturbation of my mind <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="12" REF="025665_0011_0FCEBB8980D73D90">
this occa&s;ion&mdash;the ri&s;k I &s;hould run, in common with my fellow &s;oldiers, &s;eemed heightened by the certainty of torture that awaited me in ca&s;e of being captured by the &s;avages. However, the&s;e reflections only oc|ca&s;ioned a firm re&s;olution of doing my duty vigilantly, and &s;elling my life in action as dear as po&s;&s;ible, but by no means to be taken alive, if I could evade it by any exertion &s;hort of &s;uicide.</P>
<P>My captain &s;hewed me every kindne&s;s in his power on the march, indulged me with a hor&s;e as often as po&s;&s;ible, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e his influence to obtain a commi&s;&s;ion for me, if I conducted well the pre&s;ent expedition;&mdash;poor gentleman! little did he think he was &s;oon to expire, gallantly fighting the battles of his country! I ha&s;ten now to the mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of my &s;hort narrative, the de&s;cription of Gen. St. Clair's defeat, and the &s;cenes which &s;ucceeded it.</P>
<P>On the 3d of November we arrived within a few miles of the Miami Village. Our army con&s;i&s;ted of about 1200 regular troops, and nearly an equal num|ber of militia. The night of the 3d, having rea&s;on to expect an attack, we were ordered under arms about midnight, and kept in order until ju&s;t before day light; at which time, &s;couts having been &s;ent out in various directions, and no enemy di&s;covered, we were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the parade to take &s;ome refre&s;hment. The men in general, almo&s;t worn out with fatigue, had thrown them&s;elves down to repo&s;e a little: But their re&s;t was of &s;hort duration, for before &s;unri&s;e the Indians began a tremendous attack upon the militia, &s;oon threw them into di&s;order, and forced them to re|tire before them precipitately, into the very heart of our camp.</P>
<P>But alas! what were my feelings, when &s;tarting from my &s;lumbers, I heard the mo&s;t tremendous fir|ing all around, with yellings, horrid whoopings, and expiring groans in dreadful di&s;cord &s;ounding in mine
<PB N="13" REF="025665_0012_0FCEBB8AFB06D318">
ears. I &s;eized my arms, ran out of my tent with &s;everal of my comrades, and &s;aw the Indians with their bloody tomahawks and murderous knives butchering the flying militia. I flew towards them, filled with de&s;peration, di&s;charged my firelock among them, and had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee one of the tawny &s;avages fall, who&s;e tomahawk was at that in&s;tant elevated to &s;trike a gallant officer, who was then engaged &s;word in hand with a &s;avage in front. My example, I have rea&s;on to think, animated my companions. Our own compa|ny now reached the place we occupied, and aided by the regulars of other companies and regiments, who joined us indi&s;criminately, we drove the Indians back into the bu&s;h, and &s;oon after formed in tolerable order, under as gallant commanders as ever died in defence of America. The firing cea&s;ed for a few minutes, but it was like the interval of a tornado, calculated, by an in&s;tantaneous, dreadful rever&s;e, to &s;trike the deeper horror. In one and the &s;ame minute, &s;eemingly, the mo&s;t deadly and heavy firing took place in every part of our camp; the army, expo&s;ed to the &s;hot of the enemy, delivered from the ground, fell on every &s;ide, and drenched the plains in blood, while the di&s;|charge from our troops, directed almo&s;t at random, I am fearful did but little execution. Orders were now given to charge with bayonets, we obeyed with alac|rity; a dreadful &s;warm of tawny &s;avages ro&s;e from the ground and fled before us; but alas! our officers, rendered con&s;picuous by their exertions to &s;timulate the men, become victims to &s;avage ingenuity, and fell &s;o fa&s;t, in common with the re&s;t, that &s;carce a &s;hot &s;pent in vain.&mdash;Advantages gained by the bayonet were, by this means, and want of due &s;upport, lo&s;t again, and our little corps obliged, in turn, repeat|edly to give way before the Indians.&mdash;We were now reduced to le&s;s than half our original number of regular troops, and le&s;s than a fourth part of our officers, our
<PB N="14" REF="025665_0013_0FCEBB8C6EE4EDB8">
hor&s;es all killed or taken, our artillery men all cut off, and the pieces in the enemy's hands; in this dread|ful dilemma we had nothing to do but to attempt a retreat, which &s;oon became a flight, and for &s;everal miles, amid&s;t the yells of Indians, more dreadful to my ears than &s;creams of hateful fiends to my ideas, amid&s;t the groans of dying men, and the dreadful &s;ight of bloody ma&s;&s;acres on every &s;ide, perpetrated by the In|dians on the unfortunate creatures they overtook, I endured a degree of torture no tongue can de&s;cribe, or heart conceive; yet, I providentially e&s;caped un|hurt, and frequently di&s;charged my mu&s;ket, as I am per&s;uaded, to effect.</P>
<P>Providence was plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain my &s;pirits and pre&s;erve my &s;trength, and although I had been &s;o far &s;pent previous to &s;etting out on the expedition, as to be unable to go upon fatigue for &s;everal days, or even to bear a moderate degree of exerci&s;e, I reached Fort Jeffer&s;on the day after the action, about ten in the morning, having travelled on foot all night to effect it.</P>
<P>Thus have I made the reader acquainted with the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;cenes of my life; many of them are extraordinary, &s;ome of them perhaps incredible, but all of them founded in fact, which can be atte&s;ted by numbers. Gen. St. Clair, in con&s;equence of my &s;uf|ferings, and what he and others were plea&s;ed to call &s;oldier-like exertions, pre&s;ented me with an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion, on joining the remains of my old compa|ny, in which &s;tation I mean to &s;erve my country again, as far as my &s;lender abilities will permit; tru&s;ting that the &s;ame kind, protecting Providence, which hath covered my head in the day of battle, and &s;hielded me repeatedly in the hour of danger, will di&s;po&s;e of me as to infinite wi&s;dom &s;eems be&s;t; and if I die in the cau&s;e of my country, may the remembrance of my &s;ufferings, e&s;capes, per&s;everance through divine &s;up|port and repeated mercies received, kindle a flame of

heroi&s;m in the brea&s;t of many an American youth, and induce him, while he reads the &s;ufferings of his unfor|tunate countrymen, to exert him&s;elf to defend the worthy inhabitants on the frontiers from the depreda|tions of &s;avages; who&s;e horrid mode of war is a &s;cene to be deprecated by civilized nature, who&s;e ten|der mercies are cruelties, and who&s;e faith is by no means to be depended on, though pledged in the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties. The reader will permit me to clo&s;e a &s;hort, but to me an extremely intere&s;ting narrative, with a few lines compo&s;ed, as a &s;ong, by my worthy comrade Sackville, a few days before his death, dur|ing his hour to watch while I &s;lept.</P>

<OPENER>[To the tune of&mdash;<HI>"LIBERTY TREE."</HI>]</OPENER>
<LG>
<L>AMERICANS, ri&s;e at the voice of di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>'Tis virtue to &s;uccour the brave:</L>
<L>The force of your arms di&s;tant realms &s;hall confe&s;s,</L>
<L>Join'd with tho&s;e whom your valour may &s;ave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Savage nations &s;hall learn by your conduct to ri&s;e</L>
<L>Above the untractable &s;tate,</L>
<L>Drop their cu&s;toms of malice, and learn from the wi&s;e,</L>
<L>To be civiliz'd, gentle and great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But tho&s;e who pre&s;ume again&s;t rea&s;on and right,</L>
<L>To &s;pread terror, de&s;truction and fire,</L>
<L>Shall perceive the advantage of art in the fight,</L>
<L>Shall be taught real worth to admire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wilderne&s;s then &s;hall bloom forth as the ro&s;e,</L>
<L>Tall fore&s;ts give place to rich grain,</L>
<L>While unity, peace and contentment di&s;clo&s;e</L>
<L>Their beauties to crown the domain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The native delighted&mdash;&s;ecured in his claim,</L>
<L>And in&s;tructed to &s;tick to his word,</L>
<L>Shall abandon the tomahawk, arrow and flame,</L>
<L>And the hoe &s;hall take place of the &s;word.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our eagle &s;hall then his wide pinions extend,</L>
<L>To the ocean that rolls in the we&s;t,</L>
<L>Di&s;&s;ention and di&s;cord be brought to an end,</L>
<L>And the world be permitted to re&s;t.</L>
