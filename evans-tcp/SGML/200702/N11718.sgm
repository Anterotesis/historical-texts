<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>following pages contain an an&s;wer to one of the mo&s;t artful, in&s;idious and pernicious pamphlets I have ever met with. It is addre&s;&s;ed to the pa&s;&s;ions of the popu|lace&punc; at a time when their pa&s;&s;ions are much inflamed. At &s;uch junctures&punc; cool rea&s;on and judgment are too apt to &s;leep: The mind is ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on&punc; and the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures will,</HI> therefore&punc; <HI>be thought the mo&s;t &s;alutary. Po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions will pa&s;s for demon&s;tration with many rage for &s;incerity and the mo&s;t glaring ab&s;urdities and fal&s;hoods will be &s;wallowed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The author of</HI> COMMON SENSE. <HI>has availed him&s;elf of all the&s;e circum&s;tances. Under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip to America, in the pre&s;ent calamitous &s;ituation of affairs, he gives vent to his own private re&s;entment and ambition, and recommends a &s;cheme which mu&s;t infallibly prove ruinous. He propo&s;es that we &s;hould renounce our allegiance to our &s;overeign, break off all connection with Great-Britain, and &s;et up an independent empire of the republican kind. Sen|&s;ible that &s;uch a propo&s;al mu&s;t, even at this time&punc; be &s;hock|ing to the ears of Americans; he in&s;inuates that the</HI> novel|ty <HI>of his &s;entiments is the only</HI> ob&s;tacle <HI>to their</HI> &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;that, <Q><HI>perhaps they are not yet &s;ufficiently fa&s;hionable to procure them general favour; that a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a &s;uperficial appearance of being right&punc; and rai&s;es at fir&s;t a formidable outcry in defence of cu&s;tom.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>In this he imitates all other enthu&s;ia&s;ts and vi&s;ionary a&s;|&s;ertors of paradoxes, who were con&s;cious that the common feelings of mankind mu&s;t revolt again&s;t their &s;chemes: The author, however, though he did not intend it here, pays a compliment to the Americans; for this amounts to a confe&s;|&s;ion, that amid&s;t all their grievances, they &s;till retain their allegiance and loyalty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="014809_0004_0F94DAB939F64990">
<HI>With the &s;ame view, I pre&s;ume, to make his pamphlet go down the better, he prefixes the title of</HI> Common Sen&s;e <HI>to it&mdash;by a figure in rhetoric, which is called a</HI> Catachre&s;is, <HI>that is, in plain Engli&s;h&punc; an abu&s;e of words. Under this title, he counteracts the cleare&s;t dictates of rea&s;on&punc; truth, and common &s;en&s;e, Thus have I &s;een a book written by a popi&s;h bigot, entitled.</HI> Mercy and Truth; or Charity maintained; <HI>in which the author very devoutly and chari|tably damns all heretres.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I find no</HI> Common Sen&s;e <HI>in this pamphlet but much</HI> un|common <HI>phrenzy. It is an outrageous in&s;ult on the com|mon &s;en&s;e of Americans; an in&s;idious attempt to per&s;on their minds&punc; and &s;educe them from their loyalty and true&s;t intere&s;t. The principles of government laid down in it, are not only fal&s;e, but too ab&s;urd to have ever entered the head of a crazy politician before. Even Hobbes would blu&s;h to own the author for a di&s;ciple. He unites the vio|lence and rage of a republican. with all the enthu&s;iam and folly of a fanatic. If principles of truth and common &s;en&s;e, however, would not &s;erve his &s;cheme, he could not help that by any other method than by inventing &s;uch as</HI> would, <HI>and this he has done.</HI></P>
<P><HI>No per&s;on breathing, has a deeper &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es of America, than I have&mdash;or would rejoice more to &s;ee them removed, and our liberties &s;ettled on a perma|nent, con&s;titutional foundation. But this author's propo|&s;al, in&s;tead of removing our grievances&punc; would aggravate them a thou&s;and fold. The remedy is infinitely wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. It would be like cutting off a leg, becau&s;e the toe happened to ache.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is probable that this pamphlet&punc; like others&punc; will &s;oon &s;ink in oblivion&mdash;that the de&s;tructive plan it holds out will &s;peedily be forgotten, and vani&s;h like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion; yet while any hone&s;t man is in danger of being &s;educed by it&mdash;whil&s;t there is even a po&s;&s;ibility that the dreadful evils it is calculated to produce &s;hould overtake us. I think it a duty which I owe to God&punc; to my King and Country, to counteract&punc; in this manner, the poi&s;on it con|tains. Nor do I think it le&s;s a duty thus to vindicate our
<PB N="vii" REF="014809_0005_0F94DAB9F97A6E88">
honourable Congre&s;s, and my injured countrymen in gene|ral, from the duplicity and criminal in&s;incerity with which this pamphlet virtually charges them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The reader, however mu&s;t not expect that I &s;hould &s;ub|mit to the drudgery of returning a di&s;tinct an&s;wer to every part of a pamphlet&punc; in which the lines in many places are out-numbered by fal&s;hoods: and where the author's malice and antipathy to monarchical government, mi&s;repre&s;ent al|mo&s;t every thing relative to the &s;ubject. I have done, not|with&s;tanding&punc; what I conceive to be &s;ufficient&mdash;I have deve|loped his leading principles, and obviated &s;uch mi&s;repre|&s;entations as are apte&s;t to mi&s;lead the unwary. I have, moreover, &s;hewn that this &s;cheme is big with ruin to Ame|rica&mdash;that it is contrary to the &s;entiments of the coloni&s;ts, and that in a reconciliation with Great-Britain, on &s;olid, con&s;titutional principles, excluding all parliamentary taxa|tion, the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of this continent, are on|ly to be &s;ought or &s;ound.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I neither have nor can po&s;&s;ibly have any intere&s;ts &s;epa|rate from tho&s;e of America&mdash;any object in view but her welfare. My fate is involved in her's. If &s;he becomes a conquered country, or an independent republic, I can pro|mi&s;e my&s;elf no advantage or emolument in either ca&s;e; but mu&s;t inevitably &s;hare with millions in the evils that will en|&s;ue. This I can declare, before the &s;earcher of hearts, is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Can the author of</HI> Common Sen&s;e <HI>do the &s;ame? Can he truly and &s;incerely &s;ay that he has no honour, power, or profit in view &s;hould his darling republican &s;cheme take place? If not then he is an intere&s;ted, prejudiced per&s;on, and very unfit to advi&s;e in this matter. We &s;hould be di&s;|tru&s;tful of his judgment, and on our guard again&s;t what he recommends.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The author calls him&s;elf an</HI> Engli&s;hman, <HI>but whether he is a native of</HI> Old England <HI>or</HI> New England, <HI>is a thing I neither know nor care about. I am only to know him by the features he hath here exhibited of him&s;elf, which are tho&s;e of an avowed violent Republican, utterly aver&s;e and unfriendly to the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. He hath not pre|fixed
<PB N="viii" REF="014809_0006_0F94DABAB98D75A0">
fixed his name to his pamphlet; neither &s;hall I prefix mine to this. But as I fear his abilities ju&s;t as little as I love his republican cau&s;e. I hereby pledge my&s;elf that in ca&s;e he &s;hould reply, and publi&s;h his name; I al&s;o&punc; &s;hould I think it nece&s;&s;ary to rejoin&punc; &s;hall publi&s;h my name. I honour ge|nius wherever I meet with it; but dete&s;t its pro&s;titution to bad purpo&s;es. The few &s;aint glimmerings of it that are thinly &s;cattered through this pamphlet&punc; are but a poor com|pen&s;ation for its malevolent, pernicious de&s;ign; and &s;erve only to rai&s;e our indignation and abhorrence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I hope the reader will di&s;tingui&s;h&mdash;where there is a real difference&mdash;between this Republican's cau&s;e, and that of America. If not and if he is not willing to li&s;ten calmly to truth. I advi&s;e him to &s;top here and lay down this pamph|let. But if the ca&s;e be otherwi&s;e, I have only to be&s;eech him, whil&s;t peru&s;ing the&s;e</HI> STRICTURIS, <HI>to remember that they were written to promote our reconciliation with a King and nation whom, not long &s;ince we &s;incerely loved and e&s;teemed. The bittere&s;t enmity I know is that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the&s;e who were once friends&punc; but have fallen out. On &s;uch occa&s;ions&punc; and while our re&s;entment is high, the advice which tends to gratify that re&s;entment may be the mo&s;t welcome. But when our pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub&s;ide our for|mer affections will al&s;o return; and we &s;hall then look upon him to be much more our friend who would calm our re&s;ent|ment&punc; than him who would inflame it From our former connection with Great Britain, we have already derived numberle&s;s advantages and benefits; from a clo&s;er union with her, on proper principles, we may derive &s;till greater benefits in future Duty gratitude, intere&s;t, nay Provi|dence&punc; by its all-wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations, loudly call on both coun|tries to unite, and would join them together; and may in|famy be the portion of that wretch who would put them a&s;under.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. STRICTURES <HI>on the Author's A&s;&s;ertions concerning</HI> "the Origin and De&s;ign of Government in general; and his Remarks on the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution."</HEAD>
<P>WRITERS on politics, like tho&s;e on philo&s;ophy, are very apt to be warped by prejudice, and the &s;y&s;tems they have previou&s;ly adopted. They often draw general conclu&s;ions from particular premi&s;es, and form their judgement of human na|ture, not from a general view of mankind in their various &s;ituations; but from the conduct of a few individuals, and the particular &s;tate of things at the time they wrote. Whil&s;t &s;ome of them pretend to delineate the true &s;tate of human nature, perhaps they only give us a di&s;gu&s;ting picture of their own dark and gloomy minds. Moreover, tho&s;e wri|ters are charged with founding their principles, not on na|ture and fact, but on their own prejudices, on improbable &s;uppo&s;itions and imaginary ca&s;es, which never had an cri&s;t|ence. Hence that variety of vi&s;ionary political fabrics that have been rai&s;ed, contradictory to each other, and repug|nant of common &s;en&s;e, and which will not bear the te&s;t of &s;ober examination. Some of them indeed may do very well on paper; but can never be reduced to practice, unle&s;s a race of beings, very different from men, can be found for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014809_0008_0F94DABC39865950">
Whil&s;t writers of this &s;ort amu&s;e them&s;elves with <HI>Utopian</HI> &s;y&s;tems, and go no further, they may be borne with, and pa&s;s without much cen&s;ure. Their works may be read like other romances or fictions. But if they pre&s;ume to loo&s;e the bands of &s;ociety, and overturn governments that have been formed by the wi&s;dom of ages, to make way for their own crude &s;y&s;tems, and thereby entail mi&s;ery and ruin upon mil|lions; it is then ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to examine tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, point out their de&s;tructive tendency, and unma&s;k the de|ceivers that propo&s;e them.</P>
<P>The author of a pamphlet, fal&s;ely and ab&s;urdly entitled COMMON SENSE, is not only chargeable with a large por|tion of the above defects, in common with other political &s;y&s;tem-makers, but al&s;o with the further de&s;ign of rending the Briti&s;h empire a&s;under. To realize his beloved &s;cheme of Independent Republicani&s;m, he would per&s;uade the co|loni&s;ts to renounce their allegiance to our true and lawful liege &s;overeign King GEORGE III&mdash;plunge them&s;elves into a tedious, bloody, and mo&s;t expen&s;ive war with Great Britain&mdash;and ri&s;que their lives, liberties and property on the dubious event of that war.</P>
<P>This is the principal object his pamphlet has in view; other things are only mentioned as conducive to that end. To prepare the reader for it&mdash;to take off that horror which every hone&s;t man and well-informed friend of America mu&s;t naturally feel at a propo&s;al &s;o wicked and ruinous; he fir&s;t treats of &s;ome other matters which he fa&s;hions to his purpo&s;e. He poi&s;ons the fountain that the &s;tream may be rejected. With this de&s;ign, he delivers his &s;entiments on government, the Engli&s;h con&s;titution and monarchy. I &s;hall now very briefly examine what he has offered on the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>He tells us, that <Q>&s;ome writers have confounded &s;ocie|ty with government;</Q> and then &s;upplies us with a di&s;tincti|on which is to &s;et all right. He &s;ays, <Q>Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedne&s;s.</Q> We may rea&s;onably pre&s;ume there are neither wants nor wicked|ne&s;s in Heaven. According to this doctrine then, there can be no &s;ociety nor government there; and yet we are a&s;&s;ured of the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="014809_0009_0F94DABCF98B23E0">
This di&s;tinction is not only inaccurate, but it is al&s;o found|ed on fal&s;e principles; and we might expect the rever&s;e of both, when the errors of others are profe&s;&s;edly corrected. Our wants do not produce &s;ociety; nor are they the fir&s;t or principal cau&s;e of it. Did this gentleman ever know of any one that was born out of &s;ociety? Are we not by an act of Providence in our birth, made members of &s;ociety? A &s;tate of &s;ociety is the natural &s;tate of man; and by the con|&s;titution of his mind and frame he is fitted for it. Not on|ly his wants and weakne&s;s require it, but his inclinations, his noble&s;t faculties impel him to it; and the more perfect tho&s;e faculties are, the better is he fitted for &s;ociety. As nature has thus made us members of &s;ociety, without any choice or will of ours; &s;o, whatever happine&s;s or perfection we are capable of, can only be attained in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>This writer's account of the origin of government is equally exceptionable with that of the origin of &s;ociety. I can no more a&s;&s;ent to it than to Hobbes's notion,&mdash;<Q>that mankind are naturally in a &s;tate of war, and that go|vernment in founded in &s;uperior power of force.</Q></P>
<P>Since Providence hath formed us for &s;ociety, and placed us in it from the time of our fir&s;t exi&s;tence, I am of Hook|er's opinion,&mdash;<Q>that &s;ociety could not be without govern|ment, nor government without law,</Q> though mankind were ever &s;o virtuous. For what is government, but the regulation of &s;ociety by laws? It is well known to all who are conver&s;ant in hi&s;tory, that the different &s;tates, the differ|ent forms of government which have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the world, and of which we have any records, had their origin from a variety of cau&s;es peculiar to each. Of the&s;e I &s;peak not, but of government in general, herein following my republican guide.</P>
<P>As we cannot doubt but the benevolent author of our being, wills our happine&s;s in the &s;tate where he hath placed us, he &s;urely wills al&s;o the means which lead to that end&mdash;tho&s;e means are order and government. Thus far I hold, with the be&s;t republican writers on this &s;ubject, the divine right of government, who&s;e end is the good of mankind; yet without appropriating that right to any particular form,
<PB N="12" REF="014809_0010_0F94DABDB984DE68">
exclu&s;ively of others. Were men as virtuous as angles; yet, if collected in large &s;ocieties, there mu&s;t be a variety of &s;tates and conditions among them; and wherever &s;uch &s;ocieties are, government will be indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But not to enter deeply into this &s;ubject, which would be foreign to my de&s;ign, I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that man is a moral agent, and thereby fitted to be governed by laws:&mdash;He is born in &s;ociety, who&s;e ends cannot be obtained, but by &s;ub|ordination, order and the regulation of laws; and where the&s;e are, there is government. I conclude, therefore, that government is agreeable to the will of the Deity&mdash;that it has its origin in the nature and &s;tate of man&mdash;that in framing governments by mutual compact, men act according to the law of their nature, and dictates of rea&s;on, which thus point out the only effectual way to attain happine&s;s and avoid evil. I draw my principles from nature and fact, without having recour&s;e to &s;y&s;tem&mdash;the never failing refuge of weak minds, and of party writers.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the origin he a&s;&s;igns to government, our author &s;eems to think the only bu&s;ine&s;s of government is to <HI>puni&s;h;</HI> for, he &s;ays, that as &s;ociety is a "patron," &s;o government is "a puni&s;her." But to think thus, betrays an equal ignorance of the principles of government, and of matter of fact. Numberle&s;s ble&s;&s;ings flow from government, be&s;ides the &s;ecurity re&s;ulting from a re&s;traint of vice by pu|ni&s;hing the vicious. Were there no wickedne&s;s, there would probably be little occa&s;ion for penal laws; but are the&s;e the only laws enacted by government? The criminal law of any &s;tate makes but a &s;mall part of its general code. It is Livy, I think, who &s;omewhere defines government to be, <Q>The empire of laws, and not of men.</Q> According to this definition, the laws of our author's government, <HI>produced by wickedne&s;s,</HI> would exerci&s;e a mo&s;t tyrannical &s;way&mdash;being de&s;igned only to <HI>puni&s;h,</HI> they would probably re&s;emble the laws of Draco, which were &s;aid to be written in blood. Per&s;ons who entertain &s;uch notions of government, may be well calculated to form a &s;anguinary code of laws, and after|wards to execute them; for, as we may &s;uppo&s;e their princi|ples are congenial with their minds and di&s;po&s;ition, doubtle&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="014809_0011_0F94D9F1D98182B0">
they would feel very well inclined to inflict every kind of puni&s;hment without &s;cruple.</P>
<P>To evince the truth of his a&s;&s;ertion, that <Q>Government is produced by wickedne&s;s,</Q> our author adds, <Q>Govern|ment, like dre&s;s, is the badge of lo&s;t innocence; the pa|laces of Kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of Paradi&s;e.</Q> This is mighty <HI>florid</HI>&mdash;what pity that it has no &s;olidity! Ju&s;t &s;o, &s;ay I&mdash;ploughing and &s;owing, like dre&s;s, are the badges of lo&s;t innocence: The farmer's cottage, barn, &s;table, and hog-hou&s;e are built upon the ruins of the bowers of Paradi&s;e; I cannot &s;ee that this <HI>pretty</HI> &s;entence proves any thing but the author's enmity to Kings and monarchical go|vernments: For if he would hereby &s;hew the inexpediency of either, the &s;ame argument will equally &s;hew the inexpe|diency of ploughing and &s;owing, of the farmer's cottage, barn, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Having thus laid his foundation, the author proceeds to erect his &s;uper&s;tructure; and I a&s;&s;ure you, gentle reader, the one is perfectly &s;uitable to the other. <Q>In order to gain a clear and ju&s;t idea of the de&s;ign and end of government,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>let us &s;uppo&s;e a &s;mall number of per&s;ons &s;ettled in &s;ome &s;eque&s;tered part of the earth, unconnected with the re&s;t; they will repre&s;ent the fir&s;t peopling of any country, or of the world. In this &s;tate of natural liberty,</Q>&mdash;well! what would they fir&s;t do or think of? Why.&mdash;<Q>&s;ociety will be their fir&s;t thought</Q> This indeed might po&s;&s;ibly happen, were we to &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e per&s;ons had dropped from the clouds, or &s;prung out of the earth, and could all &s;peak the &s;ame language. On any other principle, the ca&s;e here &s;tated is utterly devoid of probability.</P>
<P>The author in this, follows the example of &s;ome other manufacturers of political &s;y&s;tems, who fly to fiction, when matters of fact &s;hould be related: But as he has managed things, his fiction is contradictory and replete with ab&s;urdity. For he &s;uppo&s;es that tho&s;e per&s;ons <Q>&s;ettled in &s;ome &s;eque&s;|tered part of the earth,</Q> had emigrated&mdash;<Q>that the fir&s;t difficulties of emigration had bound them together;</Q> and yet gravely tells us, "their fir&s;t thought," when &s;ettled, "would be &s;ociety!" I opine this thought would &s;trike them, and had been practi&s;ed long before.</P>

<P>It would be a wa&s;te of time to trace this gentleman's won|derful colony any further; which is &s;o far from <Q>repre&s;ent|ing the fir&s;t peopling of any country,</Q> that I &s;incerely be|lieve it repre&s;ents the fir&s;t peopling of no one country &s;ince the days of Adam; at lea&s;t my memory does not furni&s;h me with one parallel in&s;tance at pre&s;ent; and &s;ome parts of his &s;cheme are de&s;titute even of the fainte&s;t probability. It is very likely, however, that he had the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the&s;e Briti&s;h colonies in view, while thus helping us <Q>to gain a clear and ju&s;t idea of the de&s;ign and end of government.</Q> Many circum&s;tances favour this &s;uppo&s;ition; but there is not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance between them. The fir&s;t Briti&s;h emi|grants to America, were in a &s;tate of Society before their emigration;&mdash;in England they jointly applied for grants of land here&mdash;they received grants, charters and in&s;tructions, which ve&s;ted them with a legal title to tho&s;e lands, and marked the outlines of tho&s;e governments that were to be formed here. When tho&s;e emigrants found them&s;elves in America, they did not then fir&s;t think of &s;ociety; for they were in a &s;tate of &s;ociety before, and the governments they erected here, were conformable to the plans they had pre|viou&s;ly received in England.</P>
<P>After fini&s;hing this goodly political edifice, the author is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow &s;ome <Q>remarks on the &s;o much boa&s;ted con&s;titution of England.</Q> He a&s;&s;ures us&mdash;<Q>he draws his idea of the form of government from a principle in nature which no art can overturn, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the
<PB N="15" REF="014809_0013_0F94DABF39751370">
more &s;imple any thing is, the le&s;s liable it is to be di&s;|ordered, and the ea&s;ier repaired when di&s;ordered; and with this maxim in view, he offers his remarks.</Q> But he in&s;tantly forgets his promi&s;e, and pays no regard to this maxim. Ab&s;olute monarchy is, pa&s;t all doubt, the &s;imple&s;t form of government; yet this gentleman prefers democracy, which is infinitely more complex, and the mo&s;t liable to di&s;orders of any. The truth is, that this principle was u&s;hered in, purely to contra&s;t it with the complex nature of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and thereby prejudice the reader again&s;t the latter. Let me add, that if, as he him&s;elf declares, <Q>we are never in a proper condition of doing ju&s;tice to others, while we continue under the influence of &s;ome leading partiality;</Q> this partial, avowed republican, is one of the unfitte&s;t per&s;ons breathing to offer remarks on the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. He cannot hold the &s;cales of ju&s;tice with an even hand.</P>
<P>"That the con&s;titution of England was noble," &s;ays he, <Q>for the dark and &s;lavi&s;h times in which it was erected, is granted.</Q> This is conde&s;cending&mdash;it would be more &s;o, had he informed us what "dark and &s;lavi&s;h times" he re|fers to. The con&s;titution of England, as it now &s;tands, was fixed at the revolution, in 1688&mdash;an aera ever memorable in the fair annals of Liberty. It was then that the limits of royal prerogative on the one hand, and the liberties and pri|vileges of the &s;ubject, on the other; were a&s;certained with preci&s;ion. But certainly that was neither a "dark nor &s;lavi&s;h time." It would not be worth while to contend with a man that could a&s;&s;ert it. The lamp of &s;cience never &s;hone brighter in any country than in Britain, nor did patriots of greater fame ever adorn the cau&s;e of freedom, than tho&s;e who &s;tood forth to a&s;&s;ert her liberties, at that di&s;tingui&s;hed period. If our author means any time before that, it is impertinent to the purpo&s;e, nor am I concerned about it. What is it to us, what the con&s;titution of England was two or three hundred or a thou&s;and years ago? That con&s;titu|tion, as fixed at the revolution, as it <HI>now</HI> &s;tands, is what we are intere&s;ted in.</P>

"But that it is imperfect," he continues, <Q>&s;ubject to con|vul&s;ions, and incapable of producing what it &s;eems to promi&s;e, is ea&s;ily demon&s;trated.</Q> If he will be plea&s;ed to inform me of any political con&s;titution, of human contri|vance, that was or is perfect, and not &s;ubject to convul&s;ions, I &s;hall be obliged to him, and readily give it the preference to that of England. But until he, or &s;ome other per&s;on does &s;o, I &s;hall continue in my pre&s;ent firm belief, that the con&s;titution of England approaches the neare&s;t to perfection&mdash;that it is productive of the greate&s;t happine&s;s and benefit to the &s;ubject, of any con&s;titution on earth. Nor &s;hall I he&s;itate to prefer it, in the&s;e re&s;pects, to any con&s;titution that antiquity can boa&s;t of.</P>
<P><Q>But the con&s;titution of England is &s;o exceedingly com|plex, that the nation may &s;uffer for years together, without being able to di&s;cover in which part the fault lies.</Q> The&s;e are matters that fall not within my line&mdash;I leave them to &s;uch <HI>profound, eagle-eyed</HI> politicians as our author. One thing is certain, that if any man is aggrieved, either in his per&s;on or property, he mu&s;t &s;oon know it; and in either ca&s;e he has a &s;peedy remedy by the con&s;titution of England. The late legal deci&s;ion in favour of Mr. Wilkes, (no favour|ite of the court or mini&s;try)&mdash;re&s;pecting general warrants, evidently demon&s;trates the &s;ecurity enjoyed by an Engli&s;h &s;ub|ject, the equity and &s;uperior excellence of the Briti&s;h con&s;ti|tution. But what is the complexne&s;s of that con&s;titution to us? The con&s;titution of the colonies is very &s;imple; each being admini&s;tered by a governor, council and a&s;&s;embly. Let our liberties, property and trade be once &s;ecured on a firm con&s;titutional bottom, and the complexne&s;s of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution cannot in the lea&s;t affect us.</P>
<P>Having hitherto &s;kirmi&s;hed only at a di&s;tance, our author prepares now for a nearer and more formidable attack on the Engli&s;h con&s;titution; &s;uch as &s;eems to threaten it with total demolition. <Q>By examining its component parts, he finds them to be the ba&s;e remains of two ancient tyrannies, compounded with &s;ome new republican materials. 1&s;t, The remains of monarchial tyranny in the per&s;on of the King. 2d, The remains of ari&s;tocratical tyranny in the

per&s;ons of the Peers. 3d the new republican materials, in the per&s;ons of the Commons; the two former being hereditary, are independent of the people, and therefore in a con&s;titutional &s;en&s;e contribute nothing towards the freedom of the &s;tate.</Q></P>
<P>Here are &s;everal hard words; and as &s;ome readers may not well under&s;tand them, I &s;hall beg leave to explain them. The learned reader will the more readily excu&s;e me, as this method may be&s;t elucidate the &s;ubject before us, and deve|lope this vile medly of jargon and mi&s;repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>It is, I think, generally admitted by political writers, that there is in every &s;tate, whatever its form of government may be, a &s;upreme, ab&s;olute power. The di&s;tribution of this power is what con&s;titutes the different forms of govern|ment; and that form is be&s;t, which mo&s;t effectualy &s;ecures the greate&s;t &s;hare of happine&s;s to the whole. There are u&s;ually reckoned three forms of government, called <HI>&s;imple,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e which are compounded of all three, or only two of the three. The fir&s;t is Monarchy, when the &s;upreme power of a &s;tate is lodged in one per&s;on. When this power is placed in the hands of a few, or &s;mall number of nobles, it is called an Ari&s;tocracy, which is the &s;econd form of &s;imple government. The third is, where the &s;o|vereign power is lodged in the people at large, and this is called Democracy.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e forms is &s;ubject to abu&s;e, and often has been aubu&s;ed. The abu&s;e of monarchy is called tyranny&mdash;The abu&s;e of ari&s;tocracy is called oligarchy&mdash;The abu&s;e of democracy is called anarchy; though the word tyranny may be applied to the abu&s;e of any of them. Our republican au|thor applies it to the two former, even when not abu&s;ed; and through his whole pamphlet he makes no di&s;tinction between the right u&s;e and abu&s;e of a thing. If he happens to di&s;like it, as in the ca&s;e of monarchy, however re&s;trained and cal|culated for the benefit of the &s;ubject, it is reprobated by the gro&s;s&mdash;it is nothing but <HI>tyranny.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be improper to ob&s;erve here, that monarchi|cal governments are be&s;t adapted to exten&s;ive dominions; po|pular governments to a &s;mall territory. It is al&s;o worthy of
<PB N="18" REF="014809_0016_0F94DAC17980F668">
ob&s;ervation, that, although there have been, and &s;till are many ab&s;olute monarchies; yet no government was ever purely ari&s;tocratical or democratical&mdash;owing probably to the unavoidable evils incident to each&mdash;or to the impracticable|ne&s;s of forming either. This is candidly owned by Harring|ton, a noted republican writer. "Though for di&s;cour&s;e," &s;ays he, <Q>politicians &s;peak of pure ari&s;tocracy, and pure democracy, there is no &s;uch thing as either of the&s;e in nature or example.</Q> Algernos Sidney, another republi|can writer, acknowledges the &s;ame<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See his works, page 132.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>As each of the&s;e &s;imple forms would be attended with numberle&s;s inconveniences, it has been the opinion of the wi&s;e&s;t men in every age, that a proper combination of the three, con&s;titutes the be&s;t government. It is the peculiar, di&s;tingui&s;hing glory of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, that it is a happy mixture of the&s;e; &s;o tempered and balanced, that each is kept within its proper bounds, and the good of the whole thereby promoted.</P>
<P>For what is the con&s;titution&mdash;that word &s;o often u&s;ed&mdash;&s;o little under&s;tood&mdash;&s;o much perverted? It is, as I conceive&mdash;<HI>that a&s;&s;emblage of laws, cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions which form the general &s;y&s;tem; according to which the &s;everal powers of the &s;tate are di&s;tributed, and their re&s;pective rights are &s;ecured to the different members of the community.</HI> By imparti|ally examining the component parts of the Engli&s;h con&s;ti|tution, it will be found, that the &s;upreme power is di&s;tributed in the be&s;t manner to attain this important end&mdash;the &s;ecurity of their re&s;pective rights to all the members of the community. The&s;e parts are,&mdash;</P>
<P>I. The King; who has the executive power, and other prerogatives, which are all &s;o ordered, &s;o re&s;trained within con&s;titutional limits, as to prevent their being injurious. He can take no man's money, or property of any kind, without a law pa&s;&s;ed by the other branches of the legi&s;lature for that purpo&s;e. He can take no man's life, before the per|&s;on has had a trial, and is condemned by his peers. He can deprive no man of his liberty, unle&s;s the per&s;on has vi|olated the laws of the &s;tate. And this is what our <HI>candid</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="014809_0017_0F94DAC239774DC0">
republican calls the "ba&s;e remains of monarchical tyranny."</P>
<P>II. The Peers; who are one branch of the legi&s;lature, and in &s;ome ca&s;es have a &s;hare in the judicial power. They have other privileges al&s;o, but all circum&s;cribed &s;o as to pre|vent injury to others. As the&s;e are chiefly hereditary, and are ve&s;ted with large property, they are equally independent of the crown and people, and deeply intere&s;ted in the welfare of the &s;tate. Hence they form a &s;trong barrier again&s;t any encroachment from either of the other branches, and give &s;tability to the con&s;titution. The&s;e are what our <HI>gentle</HI> republican calls "the ba&s;e remains of ari&s;tocratical tyranny."</P>
<P>III. The Hou&s;e of Commons; the members of which are cho&s;en by the people; without who&s;e con&s;ent, no mo|ney can be levied, nor law pa&s;&s;ed to bind the &s;ubject; and who are them&s;elves, as well as others, bound by the laws that are enacted. The&s;e are what our author calls the "new republican materials." But why <HI>new?</HI> The Hou&s;e of Com|mons was not fir&s;t formed at the Revolution. Its origin is hid in the remote depths of antiquity. It may be traced with certainty for near &s;ix hundred years back;&mdash;&s;ome, e&s;pe|cially republican writers, trace it much further; although it may have undergone &s;everal variations before the revoluti|on. Calling it <HI>new,</HI> therefore, is ju&s;t of a piece with many other of our author's expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme power of the &s;tate is di&s;tributed among the&s;e three branches of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, in &s;uch a manner, that the con&s;titution has almo&s;t all the advantages of each of the three &s;imple forms of government, and &s;carcely any of their inconveniences. On pre&s;erving an equal poize in each of the&s;e branches, depends the good of the whole: No pru|dent man, therefore, no real friend of Briti&s;h Liberty, will ever wi&s;h to &s;ee any of them pa&s;s the con&s;titutional limits; or attempt to throw power into any of them which would de|&s;troy the balance.</P>
<P>This is a plain, conci&s;e repre&s;entation of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution. It is &s;ufficient to refute our Republican's mi&s;re|pre&s;entation of it, ju&s;t as relating truth, in other ca&s;es, is a &s;ufficient refutation of fal&s;hood. But left he, or my reader, &s;hould think that I mean to &s;kip over any thing that has the
<PB N="20" REF="014809_0018_0F94DAC2F97588A0">
appearance of argument, I &s;hall follow him a little further on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><Q>To &s;ay, that the con&s;titution of England is an union of three powers reciprocally checking each other is farcical,</Q> he tells us. This is a new and &s;hort method of confutation, &s;uch indeed as nothing can with&s;tand. How happy is it for mankind, that this acute rea&s;oner has not thought proper to employ it, in &s;hewing the nullity of the&s;e reciprocal duties and obligations &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between hu&s;band and wife, parent and child, ma&s;ter and &s;ervant! They mu&s;t all have infalli|bly vani&s;hed, and have been annihilated by a few <HI>farcical</HI> &s;trokes of his pen! Yet &s;o it happens, that the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men, the warme&s;t advocates of liberty, have viewed this reciprocal check of the three branches of the legi&s;lature, not as "farcical, unmeaning or contradictory;" but as the mo&s;t effectual method that human wi&s;dom could devi&s;e to promote happine&s;s and liberty.</P>
<P>Still, however, he in&s;i&s;ts,&mdash;that "to &s;ay the Commons are a check upon the King, pre&s;uppo&s;es two things. 1. That "the King is not to be tru&s;ted without being looked after." I think no man &s;hould be tru&s;ted with uncontrouled power during life.&mdash;No, not even a <HI>&s;elf-denying, humble</HI> Republi|can. <Q>Or that a thir&s;t of ab&s;olute power is the natural di&s;ea&s;e of monarchy.</Q>&mdash;Not a jot more &s;o than of repub|licani&s;m. 2. That <Q>the Commons by being appointed for that purpo&s;e, are either wi&s;er or more worthy of confi|dence than the King. But as the &s;ame con&s;titution which gives the Commons a power to check the King, gives af|terwards the King a power to check the Commons; it a|gain &s;uppo&s;es that the King is wi&s;er than tho&s;e, whom it has already &s;uppo&s;ed to be wi&s;er than him. A mere ab&s;urdity!</Q></P>
<P>There is, I confe&s;s, a palpable ab&s;urdity here; but it lies in our author's <HI>&s;uppo&s;itions</HI> concerning what the con&s;titu|tion <HI>&s;uppo&s;es;</HI> not in the mutual check which the King and Commons have upon each other. Is it not highly ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that a man, becau&s;e he has a con&s;titutional check upon others, mu&s;t therefore be wi&s;er than tho&s;e others? A common con&s;table has, in many ca&s;es, a check upon his
<PB N="21" REF="014809_0019_0F94DAC3B975B780">
fellow &s;ubjects; does it therefore follow that he mu&s;t be wi&s;er, or that the con&s;titution <HI>&s;uppo&s;es</HI> he is wi&s;er than they?</P>
<P>The remaining part of this &s;ection is &s;uch mi&s;erable &s;tuff, that it would only be flinging away time to <HI>expo&s;e</HI> it;&mdash;it is not worthy of <HI>confutation.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of declamation again&s;t the Engli&s;h con&s;titution that would di&s;grace a &s;chool-boy. Some expre&s;&s;ions, indeed, &s;uch as the&s;e, <Q>That the En|gli&s;h con&s;titution is too incomprehen&s;ible to be within the compa&s;s of de&s;cription,&mdash;that no power can be from God that needs checking,</Q> with others of the &s;ame kind, &s;eem to flow from in&s;anity, and to be rather the effu&s;ions of a di&s;|tempered brain, than the language of a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>common,</HI> or any other, <HI>&s;en&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this head by referring my reader to the te&s;timony of one of the be&s;t judges in &s;ubjects of this &s;ort, and the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of juri&s;prudence, that any age has pro|duced, in favour of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution,&mdash;I mean the celebrated MONTESQUIEU. His te&s;timony will out-weigh, with the judicious, the &s;illy declamations of ten thou&s;and &s;uch <HI>Politica&s;ters</HI> as our republican author. The pa&s;&s;age I allude to is in Book xi. Chap.6. <HI>Of the Spirit of Laws,</HI>&mdash;though many others of the &s;ame kind are inter&s;per&s;ed in that excellent work.</P>

In the next place, the crudities here o&s;tered concerning he|reditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, are not new&punc; but borrowed from other writers.&mdash;Mo&s;t of them may be found in a &s;mall treati&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Grounds and Rea&s;ons of Monarchy con&s;idered and exem|plified in the Scotch Line, &amp;c.</HI> BY JOHN HALL, <HI>of</HI> Gray's Inn, <HI>R&s;quire; bound with</HI> Harrington's <HI>works.</HI></NOTE> written by one John Hall, a pen&s;ioner under Oliver Crom|well; and I have nothing to do with John Hall, but with the author of Common Sen&s;e.

<P>But it will be proper to be&s;tow a few minutes in examin|ing what is here alledged concerning monarchy in general; again&s;t which this republican mar&s;hals a formidable ho&s;t of arguments. The reader will remember, that monarchy may be either ab&s;olute; or mixed and combined with the other &s;imple forms of government. Our author makes no di&s;|tinction between the&s;e; and although all he &s;ays, and a thou|&s;and times more that might be &s;aid, were true with re&s;pect to the former; yet all this would not militate in the lea&s;t again&s;t the mild and tempered monarchy of Great-Britain. Let us, however, attend to his arguments.</P>
<P><Q>In the early ages of the world, according to &s;cripture chronology, there were no kings; the con&s;equence of which was, there were no wars; it is the pride of kings which throws mankind into confu&s;ion. Holland without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this la&s;t century, than any of the monarchical governments in Europe.</Q> It were needle&s;s, at pre&s;ent, to determine how early kings began to reign; e&s;pecially as we find by &s;cripture chronology and &s;cripture hi&s;tory, that there was murder, violence and war;&mdash;that "the earth was filled with violence"&mdash;long enough before we hear a &s;yllable about kings,&mdash;I may &s;ay before there were any. Referring tho&s;e di&s;orders, therefore, to
<PB N="23" REF="014809_0021_0F94DAC5397CDBA0">
that origin, is unfair and untrue. Melchizedec is one of the fir&s;t kings we read of; he lived in the times of patriarchal &s;implicity, and his character is re&s;pectable, being not only a king, but al&s;o "the prie&s;t of the mo&s;t High God," This account of kings is very different from our author's.</P>
<P>The in&s;tance of Holland is injudiciou&s;ly &s;elected, to &s;hew that &s;tates which have no kings, are therefore exempt from war. There has not been a general war in Europe for a cen|tury pa&s;t, in which Holland was not deeply engaged; except the very la&s;t, and this was more owing to inability than any other cau&s;e. Every page almo&s;t of the hi&s;tory of the <HI>Seven United Provinces,</HI> is a refutation of our author's a&s;&s;ertion. His in&s;inuation, that &s;tates which have not kings, are ex|empt from, and not addicted to war, is equally groundle&s;s. Republics have been as much involved in wars as other &s;tates. The &s;everal republics of Greece inli&s;ted under the banners of Sparta, on one &s;ide, or tho&s;e of Athens on the other&mdash;both republics waged a mo&s;t bloody war for thirty years to|gether. And what is very remarkable, they were plunged into this war by Pericles, a popular Athenian, and celebra|ted &s;peaker; who being impeached for <HI>embezling the public money</HI> and applying it to his <HI>own private u&s;e,</HI> took this terri|ble method to divert an enquiry. The war ended in the de|&s;truction of Athens. The &s;ingle republic of Rome, made greater havoc of the human &s;pecies, &s;hed more blood, dif|fu&s;ed more wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery through the earth, and was guilty of more cruelty, oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny, than perhaps any <HI>three</HI> monarchies that can be mentioned in the whole compa&s;s of ancient hi&s;tory. If a few &s;mall republics of modern date, have more re&s;pite from war than &s;ome mo|narchies, it is more owing, like their very exi&s;tence, to their particular &s;ituations, the jealou&s;y of neighbouring powers, and other &s;imilar circum&s;tances, than to the nature of their government.</P>

ca&s;es of &s;ickne&s;s, is &s;aid to have been taken from the croco|dile&mdash;of admini&s;tring cly&s;ters, from the Ibis, an Egyptian bird. The&s;e &s;eem to be of wor&s;e than heathen origin; yet mankind u&s;e them without &s;cruple; and perhaps their di&s;ci|pline might not be ami&s;s for our author, con&s;idering his &s;tate of mind. If a thing is good in it&s;elf, I conceive it to be a matter of very little moment, who it was that fir&s;t in|troduced it. I am clearly of opinion al&s;o, that democracy, our author's favourite &s;cheme of government, was of hea|theni&s;h origin, as well as monarchy: And &s;ince he is &s;o a|ver&s;e to any thing heatheni&s;h, I would beg leave to remind him, that fal&s;hood, deceit, and &s;peaking evil of dignities, are heatheni&s;h crimes, and expre&s;sly forbidden by &s;cripture.</P>
<P>But the wor&s;t is yet to come; for <Q>government by Kings, was the mo&s;t pro&s;perous invention the devil ever &s;et on foot for the promotion of idolatry. The heathens paid divine honours to their decea&s;ed Kings.</Q> If the devil was the author of this invention, for the purpo&s;e here al|ledged, then I aver he was mi&s;taken in his foreca&s;t; or el&s;e he &s;oon retained all the Heathen republics in his &s;ervice, to promote the &s;ame end. For it is a mo&s;t notorious, undeni|able fact, that the ancient republics&mdash;Rome, Carthage, Athens, &amp;c. were as infamous for every &s;pecies of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t abominable idolatry, as any monarchies whatever. Let the Floralia of Rome, and human &s;acrifices offered at Carthage, to mention no other in&s;tances, &s;erve as proofs of this. The truth is, that idolatry had &s;pread its gloomy reign almo&s;t univer&s;ally over the Heathen world. The form of government in any &s;tate, neither promoted nor retarded it any more than the &s;hape of their &s;hields, or the form of their wi&s;kers. The pure&s;t &s;y&s;tem of religion, that Heathen antiquity can boa&s;t of, prevailed in Per&s;ia, where monarchy was e&s;tabli&s;hed; the remains of which religion are &s;aid to be preferred to this day among the inhabitants of Indo&s;tan.</P>
<P>But <Q>Heathens paid divine honors to their decea&s;ed Kings.</Q> The more fools they, no doubt; however, they did the &s;ame to their decea&s;ed heroes, and benefactors in ge|neral, whether Kings or not, whether male or female. If

this argument, therefore, is of any force again&s;t govern|ment by Kings, it is of equal force again&s;t any improvement in agriculture; again&s;t cleaning &s;tables, and killing &s;nakes; for Heathens paid divine honours to decea&s;ed per&s;ons for all tho&s;e exploits. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to return a grave an|&s;wer to &s;uch &s;ophi&s;try; e&s;pecially, when the author may, perhaps, care as little for the Bible, as he does for the Alco|ran or Sha&s;thah, only as it may &s;erve his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>From Heatheni&s;m, our author flies next to &s;cripture for arguments again&s;t monarchy. Were I a par&s;on I &s;hould be better qualified to deal with him in this way. However, as I am a &s;incere believer in divine revelation, I &s;ometimes read the Scripture for in&s;truction&mdash;nor am I a&s;hamed to own it&mdash;Boyle, Locke, and Newton, did the &s;ame. I al&s;o have re|cour&s;e &s;ometimes to a few commentators, which the clergy|man of the place where I live, hath recommended to me. Thus furni&s;hed, I &s;hall venture to examine his &s;cripture ar|guments. One con&s;olation to me is, that he &s;eems to be an equal adept in theology and juri&s;prudence.</P>
<P><Q>The will of the Almighty, as declared by Gideon and Samuel (&s;ays our republican) expre&s;ly di&s;approves of go|vernment by Kings.</Q> So it might on tho&s;e particular occa&s;ions, and for &s;ome peculiar rea&s;ons; and yet our go|vernment by Kings at this time, may be as acceptable to the Almighty, as any other government. <Q>All anti-monar|chical parts of &s;cripture (he continues) have been &s;mooth|ly glo&s;&s;ed over in monarchical governments.</Q> If &s;o, our author has profited by the practice, and has greatly improv|ed on it; for he has entirely &s;lipt over (without giving even a <HI>&s;mooth glo&s;s</HI>) all the monarchical parts of Scripture, except one, which, I &s;hall immediately con&s;ider; after a&s;&s;uring the reader, that I never have met with the anti-monarchical parts of Scripture. In the bible, I am &s;ure they are not. The Jewi&s;h polity, in which the Almighty him&s;elf conde|&s;cended to be King (and thence called a Theocracy) is ra|ther in favour of monarchy than again&s;t it; though I am not clear, that any one &s;pecies of regular government is more acceptable to the Deity now than another; whatever prefer|ence

<P><Q>Render unto Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ar's, is the Scripture doctrine of courts,</Q> &s;ays our author; and pray is it not Scripture doctrine in other places, as well as courts? Is it not the doctrine of Him who is the Saviour of men? The words are part of an an&s;wer which our Saviour returned to an in&s;idious que&s;tion that was propo&s;ed to him by &s;ome emi&s;|&s;aries from the Phari&s;ees, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Whether it was lawful to pay tribute to Cae&s;ar, i. e. the Roman Emperor, or not? Judaea was at this time &s;ubject to the Romans. The Gaulo|nites, or Zealots, a &s;ect or party &s;o called, affirmed that the Jews, being God's people, &s;hould not acknowledge any other Lord, nor pay tribute to an heathen power&mdash;others affirm|ed the contrary&mdash;the determination was therefore put to Je|&s;us, with de&s;ign to en&s;nare him. His deci&s;ion, which was for paying the tribute, was grounded on the then practice and e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims of the Jews. They held, that where|ever the money of any per&s;on, bearing his title and image, was current, the inhabitants thereby acknowledged that per|&s;on for their &s;overeign. Since, therefore, the Jews owned this of Cae&s;ar, by admitting his money, which bore his title and image, our Saviour told them, they &s;hould al&s;o pay him tribute. For he ordered the tribute money to be brought, and the Jews owning that it bore Cae&s;ar's image and &s;uper&s;pription, or title,&mdash;<Q>Render, therefore (&s;ays he) to Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ars,</Q> i. e. &s;ince you acknowledge his &s;overeignty over you by admitting his coin, render to him the tribute which, on your own principles, is thereby due.</P>
<P>If this text has been applied to &s;upport monarchical go|vernment any further than to &s;hew, that whatever is by cu&s;|tom, law, or otherwi&s;e, ju&s;tly due to &s;overeigns, &s;hould be punctually paid, whether it be tribute, obedience, honour, &amp;c.&mdash;if, I &s;ay, it has been applied to &s;upport monarchy any further than this, it mu&s;t be by &s;ome per&s;on who under&s;tood it as little as our author; though not for the rea&s;on he a&s;|&s;igns, and which in truth makes again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="014809_0025_0F94DAC8397F3D00">
But I ha&s;ten to the pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, in which our republican author triumphs mo&s;t; which, he &s;ays, <Q>are di|rect and po&s;itive, and admit of no equivocal con&s;truction. That the Almighty has in them entered his prote&s;t a|gain&s;t monarchical government, is true, or el&s;e the Scrip|ture is fal&s;e.</Q> On the contrary, I aver, that the Al|mighty has not there entered his prote&s;t again&s;t monarchical government, further than the Jews had departed from a former permi&s;&s;ion he had given them to chu&s;e Kings, and that the Scripture is not fal&s;e. Let us now &s;ee how a little common &s;en&s;e, rea&s;on and truth, will help to clear up the matter.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ages alluded to by the author, are in 1 Sam. viii. where the I&s;raelites a&s;&s;embled in a tumultuous manner, and de&s;ired Samuel to make them <Q>a King, to judge them like all the nations;</Q> which offended Samuel, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure was di&s;plea&s;ing to the Almighty. That &s;imply de|&s;iring a King, could not be a crime, is undeniably evident; becau&s;e the Almighty had long before expre&s;sly permitted it, had directed the mode of chu&s;ing a King, and pre&s;cribed the line of conduct the King &s;hould ob&s;erve, when cho&s;en. This is done in Deuteronomy xvii. 14&mdash;20; and I &s;hall here lay a few of the pa&s;&s;ages before the reader.</P>
<P><Q>When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and &s;halt &s;ay, I will &s;et a King over me, like as all the nations that are round about me; thou &s;halt in any wife &s;et him King over thee whom the Lord thy God &s;hall chu&s;e: one from among thy brethren &s;halt thou &s;et King over thee: thou maye&s;t not &s;et a &s;tranger over thee which is not thy brother.</Q></P>
<P>The Almighty then proceeds to give directions for the King's conduct, thus cho&s;en; all, wi&s;ely &s;uited to the Jewi&s;h &s;tate, both in a religious and political view. The King "was not to multiply hor&s;es;" to prevent any intercour&s;e with Egypt, which &s;upplied other nations with hor&s;es; and be&s;ides, cavalry was not &s;uited to the hilly country of Ju|daea. The King was <Q>not to multiply wives, that his heart turn not away;</Q> as happened to Solomon when he di&s;obeyed this precept: Nor "greatly multiply gold and &s;il|ver
<PB N="28" REF="014809_0026_0F94DAC8F96E4D10">
to him&s;elf," which would introduce luxury and di&s;&s;olu|tion of manners.</P>
<P>The directions go on&mdash;<Q>And it &s;hall be when he, i. e. the King, &s;itteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he &s;hall write a copy of this law in a book, and it &s;hall be with him, and he &s;hall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law, and the&s;e &s;tatutes to do them: that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not a&s;ide from the commandment&mdash;to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom; he and his children in the mid&s;t of I&s;rael.</Q></P>
<P>Now, after this, I leave the reader to judge, whether government by Kings could be di&s;plea&s;ing to the Almighty; or, whether de&s;iring a King, according to this permi&s;&s;ion, and the&s;e directions, could be a crime in the I&s;raelites. It is impo&s;&s;ible that either can be true. The crime of the&s;e people, therefore, when they de&s;ired a King of Samuel, "to judge them like all the nations," mu&s;t be attributed to &s;omething el&s;e. And upon examination, we &s;hall find, that their error lay in the <HI>manner</HI> of their a&s;king a King&mdash;in the <HI>principles</HI> on which they acted&mdash;in a <HI>di&s;regard</HI> of the venera|ble old prophet&mdash;but chiefly in a <HI>neglect</HI> of the <HI>directions</HI> a|bove mentioned. This will appear evident from a bare re|cital of facts.</P>
<P>Samuel, by his faithful admini&s;tration, had re&s;tored the purity of religion, and re&s;cued the nation from the ho&s;tile attempts of their enemies. Debauched by pro&s;perity, as too frequently happens, dazzled with the lu&s;tre of a &s;plen|did court, and de&s;irous of its pomp, the people tumultu|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;embled to de&s;ire a King, who would re&s;emble the de&s;potic Kings which &s;urrounded them. They covered their real de&s;ign with the pretext of Samuel's age and infirmities, and his &s;ons irregularities, which was in&s;ulting the prophet's mi&s;fortunes. This is evidently implied in their own words, and in the &s;equel.</P>
<P><Q>Behold, (&s;ay they to Samuel) thou art old, and thy &s;ons walk not in thy ways; now make us a King to judge us like all the nations.</Q> Hereby Samuel, who had faith|fully
<PB N="29" REF="014809_0027_0F94DAC9B96BB8E8">
&s;erved them, had been di&s;placed; and &s;uch a de&s;potic Prince as they de&s;ired, had de&s;troyed the theocracy they were under. Accordingly, the Almighty tells Samuel, <Q>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I &s;hould not reign over them.</Q> i. e. It is not thee &s;o much as me, that they have rejected. Although Samuel was ungratefully treated; yet they &s;till more wicke<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> ne|glected the directions given by the Almighty. Pride and ambition, &s;timulated them to &s;eek a King, not &s;uch as the Almighty had directed them to chu&s;e; but &s;uch as the nati|ons had; and &s;uch as would overturn the theocracy. This was virtually rejecting the Almighty from being their King.</P>
<P>Samuel, however, was directed to hearken to the people; but as the &s;ame time to lay al&s;o before them, the nature of that monarchy they de&s;ired; a monarchy like tho&s;e around them. The ea&s;tern nations, it is well known, were under de&s;potic monarchs, the <HI>manner</HI> or nature of which, Samuel accordingly de&s;cribes to the I&s;raelites, to try, whether they would per&s;i&s;t in their choice after hearing it. Kings of this &s;ort <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> take their &s;ons and appoint them for him&s;elf <Q>for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and to be his hor&s;emen&mdash;he would take their daughter<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> confectioners, and to be cooks, and to be bakers, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>This whole pa&s;&s;age is a de&s;cription of the ea&s;tern de&s;potic monarchs, which Samuel held up to the I&s;raelites, with de&s;ign to deter them from chu&s;ing &s;uch; and this is the pa&s;&s;age which our author &s;ets down, enriched with his own mo&s;t <HI>judicious</HI> comments, to &s;hew that God <Q>entered his prote&s;t again&s;t monarchical government in general.</Q> Whereas, in truth, it is only an account of the then de&s;potic monar|chies of the Ea&s;t, which Samuel was directed to lay before the I&s;raelites, that they might &s;ee how incon&s;i&s;tent &s;uch a monarchy was with their peculiar &s;tate and circum&s;tances; and this again with de&s;ign to divert them from chu&s;ing &s;uch.</P>
<P>Ambition and pride, however, got the better of duty and intere&s;t with the people&mdash;a ca&s;e that happens but too fre|quently. They &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on having the King they had &s;et their hearts on&mdash;<Q>That we al&s;o, &s;ay they, may be like other nations.</Q> Hereby &s;hewing the greate&s;t blindne&s;s to their
<PB N="30" REF="014809_0028_0F94DACA796A9008">
own happine&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ted in being unlike the other nations, by having God him&s;elf for their King; and &s;uch a Judge or King as would be his DEPUTY, not an ab&s;olute Prince. The Almighty at la&s;t conde&s;cended to their infirmi|ties, and gave them a King: but as in the ca&s;e of the ritual law, he tempered his ju&s;tice with mercy. He gave them Saul, who proved a &s;courge; yet he ordered matters &s;o that the general end of his di&s;pen&s;ation to the Jews was not de|feated. Saul's &s;ucce&s;&s;or was "a man after his own heart," by a zealous attachment to, and punctual execution of, the Mo&s;aic law in his regal character; and David again, in our author's phra&s;e, <Q>to the evil of monarchy, added that of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;</Q> which it &s;eems, however, the Al|mighty did not di&s;approve of.</P>
<P>The reader is now left to determine freely, whether the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages make in the lea&s;t again&s;t government by Kings; and whether this republican's perver&s;ion of them, either through real or affected ignorance, &s;hould have any weight to influ|ence us again&s;t our &s;overeign. For my part, I think the ca&s;e &s;o plain, that I &s;hall not be&s;tow another word upon it; only to add the following reflections of a learned writer on the above tran&s;action. <Q>The &s;ecret &s;pring of the people's conduct (&s;ays he) was the ambition of their leaders, who could live no longer without the &s;plendor of a regal court&mdash;where every one of them might &s;hine a di&s;tingui&s;hed officer of &s;tate. This is was that made their demand cri|minal; for their chu&s;ing regal, rather than ari&s;tocratical, vice-roys, was a thing plainly indulged to them by the law of Mo&s;es, Deuteronomy xvii. As therefore ambiti|on only was in the view of the ringleaders, and no fool|i&s;h fears for the &s;tate, or hopes of bettering the public admini&s;tration, it is evident to all acquainted with the ge|nius of this time and people, that compliance with their demand mu&s;t have ended in the utter de&s;truction of the Mo&s;aic religion, as well as law.</Q> With this writer the mo&s;t celebrated commentators on this pa&s;&s;age agree.</P>
<P>Thus ambition &s;et the I&s;raelites on de&s;iring a King; our republican author &s;hould reflect, whether the &s;ame princi|ple does not actuate and lead him to reject his lawful &s;overeign.</P>

<P>IF the per&s;on who was capable of &s;o vile a pro&s;titution of Scripture, as we have &s;een in the preceeding &s;ection, &s;hould equally pro&s;titute the words, Rea&s;on, Argument, Common Sen&s;e, in this, it is not to be wondered at. That this is the ca&s;e, will appear by a near examination. From the author's defultory way of writing, and want of method in de|livering

his thoughts, it is not ea&s;y to follow him,&mdash;howe|ver, I mu&s;t do as well as I can.</P>
<P>In this &s;ection before me, this Gentleman unfolds his grand &s;cheme of a revolt from the Crown of England, and &s;etting up an independent republic in America. He leaves no method untried, which the mo&s;t experienced practitioner in the art of deceiving could invent, to per&s;uade any people to a mea&s;ure which was again&s;t their inclinations and intere&s;t, that was both di&s;agreeable and de&s;tructive. He un&s;ays in one place what he had &s;aid in another, if it happens to &s;erve the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; he cants and whines; he tries wit, raillery and declamation by turns. But his main attack is upon the pa&s;&s;ions of his readers, e&s;pecially their pity and re|&s;entment,&mdash;the latter of which is too apt to be predominant in mankind. As for him&s;elf, he &s;eems to be every where tran&s;ported with rage&mdash;a rage that knows no limits, and hurries him along, like an impetuous torrent. Every thing that falls in with his own &s;cheme, or that he happens to dis|like, is repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t aggravated light, and with the mo&s;t di&s;torted features. Such a malignant &s;pirit I have &s;eldom met with in any compo&s;ition. As often as I look in|to this &s;ection, I cannot forbear imagining to my&s;elf a guilty culprit, fre&s;h reeking from the la&s;hes of indignant ju&s;tice, and raging again&s;t the hand that inflicted them. Yet I can|not per&s;uade my&s;elf, that &s;uch fire and fury are genuine marks of patrioti&s;m. On the contrary, they rather indicate that &s;ome mortifying di&s;appointment is rankling at heart; or that &s;ome tempting object of ambition is in view; or proba|bly both. I always adopt the famous Bi&s;hop Berkeley's max|im in &s;uch ca&s;es,&mdash;<Q>I &s;ee a man rage, rail and rave; I &s;u&s;|pect his patrioti&s;m.</Q></P>
<P>That the&s;e ob&s;ervations are ju&s;tified by the author's own words, I &s;hall now proceed to evince; and I doubt not but the candid reader will con&s;ider what I &s;ay in the &s;en&s;e it is meant&mdash;is directed again&s;t this republican's ruinous &s;cheme of Independency. <HI>This</HI> and this <HI>only,</HI> is what I combat. My mo&s;t ardent wi&s;h&mdash;next to future happine&s;s&mdash;is, to &s;ee tran|quillity re&s;tored to America&mdash;our Liberties, Property and Trade &s;ettled on a firm, generous and con&s;titutional plan,
<PB N="35" REF="014809_0033_0F94DACE395E14B8">
&s;o that neither of the former &s;hould be invaded, nor the latter impoliticly or unju&s;tly re&s;trained; that in con&s;equence of this, a perfect Reconciliation with Great-Britain were ef|fected, an union formed, by which both countries, &s;upport|ing and &s;upported by each other, might ri&s;e to eminence and glory, and be the admiration of mankind till time &s;hall be no more. In &s;uch a plan, the real intere&s;t of America is indubitably to be &s;ought; and could my influence avail, there would not be a di&s;&s;enting voice in the colonies&mdash;all would unite as one man, and u&s;e every effort, to have &s;uch a plan &s;peedily &s;ettled.</P>
<P>The author of Common Sen&s;e &s;ays, <Q>He has no other preliminaries to &s;ettle with the reader, than that he would dive&s;t him&s;elf of prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;uffer his rea&s;ons and feelings to determine for them&s;elves.</Q> I have no objection to the&s;e preliminaries. They are &s;uch as I my&s;elf would chu&s;e to &s;ettle with the reader; provided his feelings are not tho&s;e of rage and re&s;entment, which are ex|ceedingly improper to determine in matters of &s;uch moment. It is not improbable indeed, that every republican who is as prejudiced, intere&s;ted, and vindictive as him&s;elf, will agree with him in all his extravagancies; and &s;o perhap they would, though an angel from Heaven were to a&s;&s;ure them that they are wrong. But I am confident the readers of that &s;tamp make but a very &s;mall number at pre&s;ent in Ame|rica.</P>
<P>After ob&s;erving, that <Q>many writers have embarked in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, with various de&s;ings, he &s;ays, they have all been ineffectual, and the period of debate is clo&s;ed. Arms, as the la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, decide the con|te&s;t; the appeal was the choice of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the con|tinent accepted the challenge.</Q> That an appeal was made by the King to arms for the deci&s;ion of this unhappy con|te&s;t, on the 19th of April, the period our author &s;ixes, is a matter in which I am not quite clear; but more of this pre&s;ently. If &s;uch a challenge was accepted by the Ameri|cans, I am &s;ure it was with great reluctance. They de&s;ired it not; although this writer, by his manner of expre&s;&s;ion, in&s;inuates they did. But he the&s;e matters as they will, cer|tain
<PB N="36" REF="014809_0034_0F94DACEF963F888">
it is, that the peried of debate did not then clo&s;e. The challenge was not accepted &s;o as to exclude an amicable ac|commodation. Since that time, the Honourable Continen|tal Congre&s;s petitioned the King, and tran&s;mitted addre&s;&s;es to the inhabitants of Great-Britain and Ireland, to facilitate a reconciliation. Nor can I conceive it po&s;&s;ible, that any one, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;anguinary wretch, who hopes to profit by our confu&s;ions, &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;ee the conte&s;t finally de|cided by arms.</P>
<P><Q>By referring the matter from argument to arms, a new aera of politics is &s;truck&mdash;all plans, propo&s;als, &amp;c. prior to the 19th of April&mdash;are like the almanacks of la&s;t year; which, tho' proper then, are &s;uperceded and u&s;ele&s;s now.</Q> I &s;hall not undertake a decide on the value of old almanacks, as I am not an almanack-maker&mdash;the au|thor may know more of the matter. But he here takes for granted what &s;hould have been proved, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the matter or conte&s;t was ultimately referred from argument to arms. If the &s;en&s;e of our Congre&s;s, and of the inhabitants of this continent at large, is any rule to judge by, all plans and propo&s;als, even tho&s;e prior to the 19th of April, are not u&s;ele&s;s. A free people, who have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their rights and liberties, are very ju&s;tifiable in &s;hewing they will not tamely give them up without a &s;truggle. But no people, except &s;ome tribes of &s;avages, who aim at the total exter|mination of their enemies, will ever lo&s;e fight of argument and negociation, to terminate &s;uch di&s;putes. To in&s;inuate the contrary of the Americans, is at once doing them the greate&s;t inju&s;tice, and offering them the greate&s;t in&s;ult. No people under Heaven are le&s;s &s;anguinary, or de&s;erve &s;uch a character le&s;s.</P>
<P>Our author repeats the &s;ame &s;entiment el&s;ewhere. "No man," &s;ays he, <Q>was a warmer wi&s;hes for reconciliation than my&s;elf, before the fatal 19th of April, 1775; but the moment the event of that day was made known, I re|jected the hardened, &s;ullen tempered Pharaoh of Eng|land for ever; and di&s;dain the wretch, that with the pre|tended title of father of his people, can unfeelingly hear of their &s;laughter, and compo&s;edly &s;leep with their blood

upon his &s;oul.</Q> This is the man, gentle reader, who declares, <Q>he is not induced by motives of pride, party or re&s;entment, to e&s;pou&s;e the doctrine of &s;eparation and independence;</Q> no, no; and if you will take his own word for it, he is by no means for <Q>inflaming or exagge|rating matters!</Q> The reader mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that a per|&s;on who can thus &s;et truth and decency at defiance, and is regardle&s;s of even the appearance of con&s;i&s;tency, has a great advantage over his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>That the expedition to Lexington was ra&s;h and ill-judged&mdash;that it was ri&s;king the peace of the continent, and wan|tonly involving fellow &s;ubjects in blood, for a mo&s;t incon&s;ide|rable object&mdash;I &s;hall mo&s;t readily allow; and our author has my leave to load that expedition with all the reproaches he can invent. I di&s;approve the de&s;ign of it as much as he&mdash;I lament its effects much more. And from whatever un|happy circum&s;tances it aro&s;e, I am well a&s;&s;ured, from the very be&s;t authority, that the King's orders to all his Com|manders or Generals on this continent, were to act <HI>only on the defen&s;ive,</HI> and in &s;upport of the laws. Now, after <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ving &s;uch re&s;training orders how the blood of tho&s;e who were killed on either <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> di&s;tance of 3000 miles from him, could be "on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">" inconceivable. If this Republican, therefore, rejected his Sovereign, on account of the unfore&s;een blood-&s;hed at Lexington, it was only be|cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> little attachment to him before; and this op|portunity was only &s;eized by the author to give went to a di&s;affection which only &s;lumbered before. Thus, by wilful &s;landers, to poi&s;on the minds of fellow &s;ubjects, and &s;ow di&s;affection among them, which may be productive of gene|ral mi&s;ery, is a crime of &s;uch complicated guilt, that none but men of the mo&s;t abandoned profligate hearts, are capa|ble of committing.</P>
<P>After all, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign any good rea&s;on, why a reconciliation with Great-Britain, which was &s;o proper be|fore the Lexington affair, &s;hould be &s;o improper afterwards. Our author, indeed, in his u&s;ual way, dogmatically a&s;&s;erts it; but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> will not pa&s;s for proofs. If peace and reconciliation on con&s;titutional grounds, and proper &s;ecurity

for our &s;everal rights, were de&s;irable and advantageous be|fore the 19th of April, 1775, mu&s;t they not have been equal|ly &s;o after the event of that unfortunate day? Let rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e an&s;wer.</P>
<P><Q>But as &s;o much has been &s;aid of the advantages of re|conciliation,</Q> continues our author, <Q>it is but right we &s;hould examine the contrary &s;ide of the argument, and inquire into the material injuries which the colonies &s;u&s;|tain, and always will &s;u&s;tain by being connected with Great-Britain.</Q> He alledges, indeed, &s;everal evils which he &s;uppo&s;es would attend that connection; but cautiou&s;ly a|voids any mention of the numberle&s;s evils and calamities which we mu&s;t infallibly &s;uffer by breaking it off. As in a former ca&s;e, &s;o in this al&s;o, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;upply his omi&s;&s;ion in due time.</P>
<P>"Some have a&s;&s;erted," he tells us, <Q>that as America hath flouri&s;hed under her former connection with Great|Britain, that the &s;ame connection is nece&s;&s;ary towards her future happine&s;s. Nothing can be more fallacious.</Q> He adds&mdash;<Q>We may as well a&s;&s;ert, that becau&s;e a child hath thrived upon milk, that it is never to have meat.</Q> How|ever glib this quaint &s;imile may run upon paper; or however convincing it may appear to &s;hallow readers; yet, in truth, when examined, it contains a palpable impropriety, and is impertinent to the ca&s;e before us. Great-Britain is figura|tively called the Parent State of the colonies; their connec|tion, therefore, may be properly compared to the <HI>relation</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between parent and child. But to compare our <HI>connection</HI> with Great-Britain to the <HI>literal food</HI> of a child, a thing different from, and not nece&s;&s;arily belonging to that <HI>relation,</HI> is manife&s;tly ab&s;urd, and a violation of the proprie|ty of language; as all who are judges of the nature of lan|guage mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible. The <HI>relation</HI> of parent and child ends not, when the latter has arrived to maturity, although the u&s;e of <HI>milk</HI> may be laid a&s;ide; and that relation may be &s;till nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of both; the &s;ame may be truly affirmed of <HI>connection</HI> with Great-Britain. But if we mu&s;t &s;tretch the &s;imile further, we find &s;omething analogous to the literal food of a child, it is the litteral &s;upport afford|ed
<PB N="39" REF="014809_0037_0F94DAD13978CC90">
by Great-Britain to the colonies, in their infant &s;tate <HI>for|merly;</HI> and the admini&s;tration of the colonies <HI>now,</HI> as well as the general laws of regulation &s;he may make for us. As to any &s;upport now, in the above &s;en&s;e, it is confe&s;&s;ed the colonies in general do not require it. With re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration of the colonies, and regulating laws proper for them, the&s;e &s;hould certainly be varied, and adapted to our maturer &s;tate. The want of this is the true &s;ource of our pre&s;ent calamities; and the attainment of it, by a re|conciliation and con&s;titutional union with Great-Britain, is what every hone&s;t American &s;hould earne&s;tly wi&s;h for. But the remedy propo&s;ed by our author, would re&s;emble the conduct of a ra&s;h, froward &s;tripling, who &s;hould call his mother a d-mn-d b&mdash;ch, &s;wear he had no relation to her, and attempt to knock her down.</P>
<P>"But even this," &s;ubjoins our author, <Q>is admitting more than is true; for I an&s;wer, roundly, that America would have flouri&s;hed as much, and probably much more, had no European taken any notice of her. The com|merce by which &s;he hath enriched her&s;elf, are the nece&s;|&s;aries of life, and will always have a market while eating is the cu&s;tom of Europe.</Q> If no European power had taken any notice of America, that is to &s;ay, if none had been at the expence or trouble of di&s;covering it, and &s;ettling colonies in it; there is great probability that America had not flouri&s;hed, but remained to this day as &s;avage a wilder|ne&s;s as when Columbus or Cabot fir&s;t de&s;cribed its coa&s;ts.&mdash;But to pa&s;s over this blunder. Let the reader only turn to any hi&s;tory of the &s;ettlement of the Briti&s;h colonies, and then judge what had been the condition of Virginia, the fir&s;t co|lony, and latterly of Georgia and Nova-Scotia, if Great-Britain had not &s;upported them. They mu&s;t as infallibly have peri&s;hed, as an infant without its proper food, had not Great-Britain afforded her aid and &s;upport; which have been more or le&s;s extended to the colonies in general. Even after they had &s;urmounted their fir&s;t difficulties, what had been their fate, had not Great-Britain protected them? If &s;o happens that avarice, ambition and fighting, are cu&s;toms of Europe as well as eating. This being the ca&s;e, &s;ome other
<PB N="40" REF="014809_0038_0F94DAD1FA312BC8">
European power would indubitably have &s;eized all the&s;e co|lonies, in their infant &s;tate, had not Great-Britain held out her protection.</P>
<P>And here much matter of grief is pre&s;ented to this poor Gentleman. He pathetically laments, that&mdash;<Q>Alas! we have been long led away by ancient prejudices, and made large &s;acrifices to &s;uper&s;tition&mdash;not con&s;idering that the motive of Great-Britain in protecting us, was intere&s;t, not attachment;</Q> and then he &s;pins out a tedious, affected &s;entence of her <Q>not protecting us from our enemies on our account, but from her enemies on her own account,</Q> &amp;c. Suppo&s;ing this were true, where is the harm? Great-Britain actually <HI>did</HI> protect us; and it is a matter of little moment to us, what her motives were. If &s;he received be|nefit by it, &s;o much the better. Mutual intere&s;t is the &s;tronge&s;t bond of union between &s;tates, as the hi&s;tory of mankind te&s;tifies; and certainly that nation would act a mo&s;t ab&s;urd, as well as wicked part, which lavi&s;hed away its blood and trea&s;ure, without any pro&s;pect of national advantage in return. But I firmly believe, that his a&s;&s;ertions on this head are as fal&s;e, as they are ungenerous; and that Great-Britain, in protecting us, was actuated by motives of affection and attachment, as well as intere&s;t. The whole of her conduct to the colonies, till lately, evinces it&mdash;the Americans them&s;elves have acknowledged it. Great-Britain, no doubt, derived many advantages from the colonies; but &s;hould we under|value her protection on that account, or a&s;cribe it to &s;ordid motives only? It is every man's intere&s;t as well as duty to be hone&s;t; would it, therefore, be candid, generous or true, to &s;uppo&s;e, that every hone&s;t man is actuated by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s only?&mdash;But candour and truth are things that have nothing to do with the procedure of this dark republican, who aims at utterly effacing every trace of former affection and friend|&s;hip between Great-Britain and the colonies; and like a fiend that delighted in human mi&s;ery, would arm them with the mo&s;t deadly, irreconciliable hatred again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>But he denies that Britain is the parent country of the&s;e colonies. He <Q>reprobates the phra&s;e, as being fal&s;e, &s;elfi&s;h, narrow and ungenerous.&mdash;Europe, (&s;ays he) and not
<PB N="41" REF="014809_0039_0F94DAD2B988F548">
England, is the parent country of the colonies.</Q> It is an ob&s;ervation of Epictetus, <Q>That if a man will contra|dict the mo&s;t evident truths, it will not be ea&s;y to find ar|guments wherewith to confute him&mdash;that the di&s;po&s;ition to contradict &s;uch truths, proceeds from want to candor and mode&s;ty.</Q> He moreover adds&mdash;that when <HI>&s;ome ad|venturous</HI> &s;pirits in his time, undertook to deny the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t evident truths&mdash;<Q>This denial was admired by the vulgar for &s;trength of wit and great learning.</Q></P>
<P>Whatever circum&s;tances can denominate any country to be the parent &s;tate or country of colonies, may be truly pre|dicated of England, with re&s;pect to the&s;e American colonies. They were di&s;covered at the Expence of the Engli&s;h crown&mdash;fir&s;t &s;ettled by Engli&s;h emigrants, and the governments erect|ed here were formed on the model of the Engli&s;h govern|ment, as nearly as the &s;tate of things would admit. The coloni&s;ts were deemed Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, and entitled to all the privileges of Engli&s;hmen. They were &s;upported and protect|ed at the expence of Engli&s;h blood and trea&s;ure. Emigrants, it is true, re&s;orted here from other countries in great num|bers; but the&s;e were not entitled to all the privileges of En|gli&s;h &s;ubjects, till naturalized by an act of the Engli&s;h legi&s;la|ture, or &s;ome A&s;&s;embly here; and the prodigious confluence of &s;trangers into the colonies, is a proof of the mild and li|beral &s;pirit by which they were cheri&s;hed and admini&s;tered. If the&s;e particulars do not entitle England to the appellation of mother-country to the&s;e colonies, I know not what can; and the&s;e particulars cannot be predicated of any other coun|try in Europe be&s;ides England.</P>
<P>The author tells us, however&mdash;<Q>that the phra&s;e parent or mother country, hath been je&s;uitically adopted by the King and his para&s;ites, with a low papi&s;tical de&s;ign of gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakne&s;s of our minds.</Q> I conceive the pre&s;ent King, or his para&s;ites, as he calls them, were not the fir&s;t or only per&s;ons who a|dopted this phra&s;e; and, therefore, it could not an&s;wer &s;uch a de&s;ign. The phra&s;e hath already been u&s;ed, both here, and in Britain, &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the colonies.</P>
<P>But this curious ob&s;ervation was introduced purely to
<PB N="42" REF="014809_0040_0F94DAD37996F350">
in|&s;inuate the King is a papi&s;t; which has ju&s;t as much truth in it, as to in&s;inuate that he is a Mahometan or Gentoo; for there is not a firmer prote&s;tant in Great Britain, than his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty. The in&s;inuation might have &s;ome effect on the credulous weakne&s;s of &s;ome ignorant people, who have harboured &s;uch an opinion; and I have heard the Quebec|bill alledged as a proof of it, by which, they &s;aid, <Q>pope|ry was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Canada, and the King had violated his coronation oath.</Q></P>
<P>An examination of the Quebec bill, falls not within the compa&s;s of my de&s;ign. It has undergone the &s;crutiny of much abler hands; &s;ome of which have affirmed, and others denied, that popery was thereby e&s;tabli&s;hed. I di&s;like the bill, chiefly becau&s;e it ve&s;ts the Governor and his Council with exorbitant power. It is certain, however, that the popi&s;h clergy of Canada, complain of the bill, and think them&s;elves in a wor&s;e &s;ituation by it, than the articles of ca|pitulation and &s;urrender left them. By its exempting &s;uch Canadians as come over to the prote&s;tant religion, from pay|ing any eccle&s;ia&s;tical dues to their prie&s;ts, it would &s;eem, as if the bill was intended to dimini&s;h the number of papi&s;ts. Be all this as it may, it is pa&s;t any doubt, that the King did not in the lea&s;t violate his coronation oath by a&s;&s;enting to that bill. This will evidently appear by in&s;pecting the oath it&s;elf: and as the removal of mutual prejudices to faciliate a reconcilia|tion, is my principal view; as the oath is &s;hort, and has been &s;een by few, I &s;hall here in&s;ert it. The coronation oath is admini&s;tered by one of the archbi&s;hops or bi&s;hops, in the following words and manner&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>The archbi&s;hop &s;hall &s;ay,</HI> Will you &s;olemnly promi&s;e and &s;wear, to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereunto belonging, according to the &s;tatutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and cu&s;toms of the &s;ame? <HI>The King &s;hall &s;ay,</HI> I &s;olemnly promi&s;e &s;o to do.</P>
<P><HI>The archbi&s;hop.</HI> Will you, to your power, cau&s;e law and ju&s;tice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments? <HI>King.</HI> I will.</P>
<P><HI>The archbi&s;hop.</HI> Will you to the utmo&s;t of your power maintain the laws of God; the true profe&s;&s;ion of the go&s;pel,
<PB N="43" REF="014809_0041_0F94DAD439D87CA8">
and the prote&s;tant reformed religion, e&s;tabli&s;hed by law? And will you pre&s;erve unto the bi&s;hops and clergy of this realm, and to the churches committed to their charge, all &s;uch rights and privileges, as by the law do or &s;hall apper|tain unto them, or any of them? <HI>King.</HI> All this, I pro|mi&s;e to do.</P>
<P><HI>After this the King, laying his hand on the holy go&s;pel, &s;hall &s;ay,</HI> The things which I have here before promi&s;ed, I will perform and keep: So help me God. <HI>And then &s;hall ki&s;s the book.</HI></P>
<P>This is the coronation oath, and mode of admini&s;tering it, as pre&s;cribed by law; and the reader mu&s;t &s;ee that is has no more relation to the &s;tate of religion in Canada, a con|quered province, than to the &s;tate of religion in Minorca, a conquered i&s;land, the inhabitants of which are papi&s;ts, and enjoy as great, if not greater privileges than the Canadians.</P>
<P>"But admitting," continues our author, <Q>that we were all of Engli&s;h de&s;cent, what does it amount to? Nothing. Britain being now an open enemy, extingui&s;hes every other name and title; and to &s;ay that reconciliation is a duty, is truly farcical.</Q> Here the <HI>farcical</HI> argument meets me again; and what &s;hall I &s;ay to it?

promote our happine&s;s and intere&s;t, to mention nothing el&s;e, be a duty, then reconciliation is our duty.</P>
<P>He el&s;ewhere enlarges on this head. <Q>Bring the doc|trine of reconciliation,</Q> &s;ays he, <Q>to the touch-&s;tone of nature, and then tell me, whether you can hereafter love, honour and faithfully &s;erve the power that carried fire and &s;word into your land!</Q> All this, and a great deal more of the kind, can only proceed from a &s;uppo&s;ition of the author, that others are as vindictive and unforgiving as him&s;elf. When &s;tates go to war, mutual acts of ho&s;tility mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue; and to think that no reconciliation &s;hould afterwards take place between them, is as contrary to every dictate of humanity and religion, as to think that a private per&s;on &s;hould never forgive a private injury, or be reconciled to him that offered it. I lament as much as any one, the blood that has been &s;hed, and the deva&s;tation that has been made during this conte&s;t: But the&s;e have been comparatively &s;mall, if we con&s;ider the torrents of blood that have flowed, the wide-&s;pread ruin that has attended the frequent de&s;tructive wars between England and Scotland; yet the&s;e nations are now happily united&mdash;they mutually love, honour, and faithfully &s;erve each other.</P>
<P>The author refers us to the &s;tate of Bo&s;ton, and paints the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of its inhabitants in the &s;tronge&s;t colours, to &s;timulate the revenge of Americans, and bani&s;h every idea of reconciliation with Britain. I &s;incerely take part in the calamities of Bo&s;ton, and other places that have &s;uffered. I

feel the mo&s;t tender &s;ympathetic pity for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their inhabitants. But how the &s;hedding of more blood, or &s;preading equal deva&s;tation along the whole &s;ea coa&s;t of this continent&mdash;the inevitable con&s;equences of not li&s;tening to re|conciliation&mdash;how the&s;e, I &s;ay, can alleviate the misfortunes of the people of Bo&s;ton, or any other &s;ufferers, in what I am not able to &s;ee.</P>
<P>"Much hath been &s;aid," he tells us, <Q>of the united &s;trength of Britain and the colonies; that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world: But this is a mere pre&s;umption; the fate of war is uncertain&mdash;the next war may not turn out like the la&s;t.</Q> But he chaunts quite another tune, when he would hold up the advantages of a &s;eparation from Britain. In that ca&s;e he avers&mdash;<Q>'Tis not in the power of England, or of Europe, to conquer Ame|rica&mdash;nay, our pre&s;ent numbers are &s;ufficient to repell the force of the whole world!</Q>&mdash;This is only one &s;ample among a thou&s;and, of the duplicity and contradiction which run through his pamphlet.</P>
<P>After telling us, what is very true, that we have no bu&s;i|ne&s;s to "&s;et the world at defiance," he adds, as an induce|ment to &s;eparate from Britain&mdash;<Q>Our plan is commerce; and that well attended to, will &s;ecure us the peace and friend&s;hip of Europe, becau&s;e it is the intere&s;t of Europe to have America a free port. Her trade will always be a protection, and her barrenne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver will &s;e|cure her from invaders.</Q>&mdash;Yes, yes; no doubt, if Ame|rica were once to throw off her connection with Britain, the golden age would be re&s;tored! The Millennial &s;tate would commence. <Q>Men would in&s;tantly beat their &s;words into plough-&s;hears, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks. Na|tion would not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, not learn war any more.</Q> Such are the happy times our author promi&s;es us, if America were an independent republic! But until he can give us &s;ome a&s;&s;urance that may be relied on, that am|bition, pride, avarice, and all that dark train of pa&s;&s;ions which u&s;ually attend them, will be extingui&s;hed in the hu|man brea&s;t, and will no more exert their baneful influence, I mu&s;t beg leave to doubt the truth of his a&s;&s;ertions&mdash;I mu&s;t

que&s;tion, whether we &s;hall live in perpetual peace with Eu|rope, or even with each other, after our revolt from England.</P>
<P>The argument or rea&s;on he advances for it here, is con|tradicted by general experience and matter of fact. A flou|ri&s;hing trade naturally increa&s;es wealth; and for this and other rea&s;ons, as naturally leads to war. Carthage, Ve|nice and Holland&mdash;all commercial republics&mdash;were frequent|ly engaged in bloody wars, in the days of their pro&s;perity. Nor is "barrenne&s;s of gold and &s;ilver" any &s;ecurity again&s;t war or inva&s;ions. Experience and fact are equally again&s;t this po&s;ition. I never heard of the gold or &s;ilver mines of Flanders. The Low Countries are entirely barren of both; but they are remarkable for their fertility, good pa&s;turage, manufactures, and formerly, for trade; yet I may &s;ay, each field there is a field of blood, and has been the &s;cene of &s;ome dreadful carnage. Great-Britain and France have few or no gold and &s;ilver mines; yet they have been theatres of bloody wars, as long as any record we have of either reaches. On the other hand, South America &s;upplies half the globe with gold and &s;ilver; and yet, &s;trange to tell, on our author's principles, no rival power has ever contended with Spain or Portugal for the dominion of South America! No invaders have attempted to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them.</P>
<P>The truth is, that mines producing tho&s;e metals are ra|ther injurious than beneficial to any country. They unbrace the nerves of indu&s;try, induce &s;loth, and damp the &s;pirit of commerce. Spain was one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing, power|ful monarchies in Europe, when this continent was di&s;cover|ed. Peru and Mexico then poured their immen&s;e trea&s;ures into her lap, and have been doing &s;o ever &s;ince; yet Spain, ever &s;ince, has been on the decline, and is dwindled, not|with&s;tanding her gold and &s;ilver, into a &s;tate, I may &s;ay, of in&s;ignificance. The country that abounds in fertile fields and luxuriant pa&s;turage&mdash;that produces the nece&s;&s;aries of life in abundance&mdash;that furni&s;hes the various materials for in|du&s;try and art, and the articles for an exten&s;ive commerce; &s;uch a country, though barren of gold and &s;ilver, is the mo&s;t inviting to ambition, the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to inva&s;ions; and &s;uch a country is North-America.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="014809_0045_0F94DAD7397601B8">
But our author now waxes &s;o exceedingly warm, and a&s;&s;umes &s;o terrific an air, that I almo&s;t dread to approach him. "I challenge," &s;ays he, <Q>the warme&s;t advocate for reconciliation, to &s;hew a &s;ingle advantage that this coun|try can reap by being connected with Great-Britain, I re|peat the challenge, not a &s;ingle advantage is derived.</Q></P>
<P>The po&s;itive, dogmatical manner in which this challenge is repeated, reminds me of an ob&s;ervation made by the ex|cellent Dr. Beattie, which applies, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, as exactly, as if this blu&s;tering challenge had given ri&s;e to its "In reading &s;ceptical books," &s;ays the worthy Doctor, <Q>I have often found, that the &s;trength of the author's at|tachment to his paradox, is in proportion to its ab&s;urdi|ty. If it deviates but a little from common opinion, he gives him&s;elf but little trouble about it; if it be incon&s;i&s;|tent with univer&s;al belief, he conde&s;cends to argue the matter, and to bring what, with him, pa&s;&s;es for a proof of it; If it be &s;uch as no man ever did or could believe, he is &s;till more conceited of his proof and calls it demon&s;tration, but if it is inconceivable, it is a wonder if he does not take it for granted.</Q> Our republican takes it for granted, that no advantage could re&s;ult from our future connection with Great-Britain&mdash;a parodox which I think, mu&s;t be utterly in|conceivable to every other human under&s;tanding. Brimful, however, of this conceit, he throws down his gauntlet, and offers this challenge; leaving his readers to &s;tare a conveni|ent time, and to he&s;itate which they &s;hould admire mo&s;t&mdash;the ab&s;urdity of taking this point for granted&mdash;or, the <HI>for|titude of face</HI> that could advance &s;uch a parodox.</P>
<P>I think it no difficult matter to point out many advantages which will certainly attend our reconciliation and connection with Great-Britain, on a firm, con&s;titutional plan. I &s;hall &s;elect a few of the&s;e; and that their importance may be more clearly di&s;cerned, I &s;hall afterwards point out &s;ome of the evils which inevitably mu&s;t attend our &s;eparating from Britain, and declaring for independency. On each article I &s;hall &s;tudy brevity.</P>
<P N="1">1. By a reconciliation with Britain, a period would be put to the pre&s;ent calamitous war, by which &s;o many lives
<PB N="48" REF="014809_0046_0F94DAD7F982DAC8">
have been lo&s;t, and &s;o many more mu&s;t be lo&s;t, if it con|tinues. This alone is an advantage devoutly to be wi&s;hed for. This author &s;ays&mdash;<Q>The blood of the &s;lain, the weeping voice of nature cries, 'Tis time to part.</Q> I think they cry ju&s;t the rever&s;e. The blood of the &s;lain, the weep|ing voice of nature cries&mdash;It is time to be reconciled; it is time to lay a&s;ide tho&s;e animo&s;ities which have pu&s;hed on Britons to &s;hed the blood of Britons; it is high time that tho&s;e who are connected by the endearing ties of religion, kindred and country, &s;hould re&s;ume their former friend|&s;hip, and be united in the bond of mutual affection, as their intere&s;ts are in&s;eparably united.</P>
<P N="2">2. By a Reconciliation with Great-Britain, Peace&mdash;that faire&s;t off&s;pring and gift of Heaven&mdash;will be re&s;tored. In one re&s;pect Peace is like health; we do not &s;ufficiently know its value but by its ab&s;ence. What unea&s;ine&s;s and anxie|ty, what evils, has this &s;hort interruption of peace with the parent-&s;tate, brought on the whole Briti&s;h empire! Let eve|ry man only con&s;ult his feelings&mdash;I except my antagoni&s;t&mdash;and it will require no great force of rhetoric to convince him, that a removal of tho&s;e evils, and a re&s;toration of peace, would be a &s;ingular advantage and ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P N="3">3. Agriculture, commerce, and indu&s;try would re&s;ume their wonted vigor. At pre&s;ent, they langui&s;h and droop, both here and in Britain; and mu&s;t continue to do &s;o, while this unhappy conte&s;t remains un&s;ettled.</P>
<P N="4">By a connection with Great-Britain, our trade would &s;till have the protection of the greate&s;t naval power in the world. England has the advantage, in this re&s;pect, of eve|ry other &s;tate, whether of ancient or modern times. Her in&s;ular &s;ituation, her nur&s;eries for &s;eamen, the &s;uperiority of tho&s;e &s;eamen above others&mdash;the&s;e circum&s;tances to menti|on no other, combine to make her the fir&s;t maritime power in the univer&s;e&mdash;&s;uch exactly is the power who&s;e protection we want for our commerce. To &s;uppo&s;e, with our author, that we &s;hould have no war, were we to revolt from England, is too ab&s;urd to de&s;erve a confutation. I could ju&s;t as &s;oon &s;et about refuting the reveries of &s;ome brain-&s;ick enthu&s;ia&s;t. Pa&s;t experience &s;hews that Britain is able to defend our com|merce,
<PB N="49" REF="014809_0047_0F94DAD8B975D2D8">
and our coa&s;ts; and we have no rea&s;on to doubt of her being able to do &s;o for the future.</P>
<P N="5">5. The protection of our trade, while connected with Bri|tain, will not co&s;t us a <HI>fiftieth</HI> part of what it mu&s;t co&s;t, were we our&s;elves to rai&s;e a naval force &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6. Whil&s;t connected with Great-Britain, we have a boun|ty on almo&s;t every article of exportation; and we may be better &s;upplied with goods by her, than we could el&s;ewhere. What our author &s;ays is true&mdash;<Q>that our imported goods mu&s;t be paid for, buy them where we will;</Q> but we may buy them dearer, and of wor&s;e quality, in one place than another. The manufactures of Great-Britain confe&s;&s;edly &s;urpa&s;s any in the world&mdash;particularly tho&s;e in every kind of metal, which we want mo&s;t; and no country can afford linens and woollens, of equal quality cheaper.</P>
<P N="7">7. When a Reconciliation is effected, and things return into the old channel, a few years of peace will re&s;tore every thing to its pri&s;tine &s;tate. Emigrants will flow in as u&s;ual from the different parts of Europe. Population will advance with the &s;ame rapid progre&s;s as formerly, and our lands will ri&s;e in value.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages are not imaginary but real. They are &s;uch as we have already experienced; and &s;uch as we may derive from a connection with Great-Britain for ages to come. Each of the&s;e might ea&s;ily be enlarged on, and others added to them; but I only mean to &s;ugge&s;t a few hints to the reader.</P>
<P>Let us now, if you plea&s;e, take a view of the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion. Suppo&s;e we were to revolt from Great-Bri|tain, declare our&s;elves Independent, and &s;et up a Republic of our own&mdash;what would be the con&s;equence?&mdash;I &s;tand a|gha&s;t at the pro&s;pect&mdash;my blood runs chill when I think of the calamities, the complicated evils that mu&s;t en&s;ue, and may be clearly fore&s;een&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible for any man to fore|&s;ee them all. Our author cautiou&s;ly avoids &s;aying any thing of the inconveniences that would attend a &s;eparation. He does not even &s;uppo&s;e that any inconvenience would attend it. Let us only declare our&s;elves independent, break loo&s;e from Great-Britain, and according to him, a Paradi|&s;aical &s;tate will follow! But a prudent man will con&s;ider and
<PB N="50" REF="014809_0048_0F94DAD9795A4810">
weigh matters well before he con&s;ents to &s;uch a mea&s;ure&mdash;when on the brink of &s;uch a dreadful precipice, he mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily recoil, and think of the con&s;equences, before he advances a &s;tep forward. Suppo&s;ing then we declared for Independency,&mdash;what would follow? I an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. All our property throughout the continent would be unhinged; the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, and mo&s;t violent convul|&s;ions would take place. It would not be here, as it was in England at the Revolution in 1688. That revolution was not brought about by any defeazance or di&s;annulling the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. JAMES II, by abdicating the throne, left it vacant for the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; accordingly his eld|e&s;t daughter and her hu&s;band &s;tept in. Every other matter went on in the u&s;ual, regular way; and the con&s;titution, in|&s;tead of being di&s;&s;olved, was &s;trengthened. But in ca&s;e of our revolt, the old con&s;titution would be totally &s;ubverted. The common bond that tied us together, and by which our property was &s;ecured, would be &s;napt a&s;under. It is not to be doubted but our Congre&s;s would endeavour to apply &s;ome remedy for tho&s;e evils; but with all deference to that re&s;pect|able body, I do not apprehend that any remedy in their pow|er would be adequate, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time. I do not chu&s;e to be more explicit; but I am able to &s;upport my opinion.</P>
<P N="2">2. What a horrid &s;ituation would thou&s;ands be reduced to who have taken the oath of allegiance to King; yet con|trary to their oath, as well as inclination, mu&s;t be compelled to renounce that allegiance, or abandon all their property in America! How many thou&s;ands more would be reduced to a &s;imilar &s;ituation; who, although they took not that oath, yet would think it incon&s;i&s;tent with their duty and a good con&s;cience to renounce their Sovereign; I dare &s;ay the&s;e will appear trifling difficulties to our author; but whatever he may think, there are thou&s;ands and thou&s;ands who would &s;ooner lo&s;e all they had in the world, nay life it&s;elf, than thus wound their con&s;cience. A Declaration of Indepen|dency would infallibly di&s;unite and divide the coloni&s;ts.</P>
<P N="3">3. By a Declaration for Independency, every avenue to an accommodation with Great-Britain would be clo&s;ed; the &s;word only could then decide the quarrel; and the &s;word
<PB N="51" REF="014809_0049_0F94DADA395CE7F0">
would not be &s;heathed till one had conquered the other.</P>
<P>The importance of the&s;e colonies to Britain need not be enlarged on, it is a thing &s;o univer&s;ally known. The great|er their importance is to her, &s;o much the more ob&s;tinate will her &s;truggle be not to lo&s;e them. The independency of America would, in the end, deprive her of the We&s;t-Indies, &s;hake her empire to the foundation, and reduce her to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t mortifying in&s;ignificance. Great-Britain there|fore mu&s;t, for her own pre&s;ervation, ri&s;k every thing, and exert her whole &s;trength, to prevent &s;uch an event from taking place. This being the ca&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4. Deva&s;tation and ruin mu&s;t mark the progre&s;s of this war along the &s;ea coa&s;t of America. Hitherto, Britain has not exerted her power. Her number of troops and &s;hips of war here at pre&s;ent is very little more than &s;he judged ex|pedient in time of peace&mdash;the former does not amount to 12,000 men&mdash;nor the latter to 40 &s;hips, including frigates: Both &s;he, and the colonies, hoped for and expected an ac|commodation; neither of them has lo&s;t &s;ight of that de&s;ire|able object. The &s;eas have been open to our &s;hips; and al|though &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes have unfortunately happened, yet a ray of hope &s;till cheared both &s;ides that, peace was not di&s;tant. But as &s;oon as we declare for independency, every pro&s;pect of this kind mu&s;t vani&s;h. Ruthle&s;s war, with all its aggra|vated horrors, will ravage our once happy land&mdash;our &s;ea|coa&s;ts and ports will be ruined, and our &s;hips taken. Tor|rents of blood will be &s;pilt, and thou&s;ands reduced to beg|gary and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>This melancholy conte&s;t would la&s;t till one &s;ide conquered. Suppo&s;ing Britain to be victorious; however high my opini|on is of Briti&s;h Genero&s;ity, I &s;hould be exceedingly &s;orry to receive terms from her in the haughty tone of a conqueror. Or &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a failure of her manufactures, commerce and &s;trength, that victory &s;hould incline to the &s;ide of Ame|rica; yet who can &s;ay in that ca&s;e, what extremities her &s;en&s;e of re&s;entment and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation will drive Great-Britain to? For my part, I &s;hould not in the lea&s;t be &s;ur|prized, if on &s;uch a pro&s;pect as the Independency of Ameri|ca, &s;he would parcel out this continent to the different Eu|ropean
<PB N="52" REF="014809_0050_0F94DADAF960A4F8">
Powers. Canada might be re&s;tored to France, Flo|rida to Spain, with additions to each&mdash;other &s;tates al&s;o might come in for a portion. Let no man think this chi|merical or improbable. The independency of America would be &s;o fatal to Britain, that &s;he would leave nothing in her power undone to prevent it. I believe as firmly as I do my own exi&s;tence, that if every other method failed, &s;he would try &s;ome &s;uch expedient as this, to di&s;concert our &s;cheme of independency; and let any man figure to him&s;elf the &s;ituation of the&s;e Briti&s;h colonies, if only Canada were re&s;tored to France!</P>
<P N="5">5. But &s;uppo&s;ing once more that we were able to cut off every regiment that Britain can &s;pare or hire, and to de&s;troy every &s;hip &s;he can &s;end&mdash;that we could beat off any other European power that would pre&s;ume to intrude upon this continent: Yet, a republican form of government would neither &s;uit the genius of the people, nor the extent of America.</P>
<P>In nothing is the wi&s;dom of a legi&s;lator more con&s;picuous than in adapting his form of government to the genius, man|ners, di&s;po&s;ition and other circum&s;tances of the people with whom he is concerned. If this important point is overlook|ed, confu&s;ion will en&s;ue; his &s;y&s;tem will &s;ink into neglect and ruin. Whatever check or barriers may be interpo&s;ed, nature will always &s;urmount them, and finally prevail. It was chiefly by attention to this circum&s;tance, that Lycurgus and Solon were &s;o much celebrated; and that their re&s;pec|tive republics ro&s;e afterwards to &s;uch eminence, and acquired &s;uch &s;tability.</P>
<P>The Americans are properly Britons. They have the manners, habits, and ideas of Britons; and have been ac|cu&s;tomed to a &s;imilar form of government. But Britons never could bear the extremes, either of monarchy or re|publicani&s;m. Some of their Kings have aimed at de&s;poti&s;m; but always failed. Repeated efforts have been made to|wards democracy, and they equally failed. Once indeed republicani&s;m triumphed over the con&s;titution; the de&s;po|ti&s;m of one per&s;on en&s;ued; both were finally expelled. The inhabitants of Great-Britain were quite anxious for the re|&s;toration
<PB N="53" REF="014809_0051_0F94DADBB96D2FE8">
of <HI>royalty</HI> in 1660, as they were for its expul&s;ion in 1642, and for &s;ome &s;ucceeding years. If we may judge of future events by pa&s;t tran&s;actions, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, this would mo&s;t probably be the ca&s;e of America, were a re|publican form of government adopted in our pre&s;ent ferment. After much blood was &s;hed, tho&s;e confu&s;ions would termi|nate in the de&s;poti&s;m of &s;ome one &s;ucce&s;sful adventurer; and &s;hould the Americans be &s;o fortunate as to emancipate them&s;elves from that thraldom, perhaps the whole would end in a limited monarchy, after &s;hedding as much more blood. Limited monarchy is the form of government which is mo&s;t favourable to liberty&mdash;which is be&s;t adapted to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and temper of Britons; although here and there among us a crack-brained zealot for democracy or ab&s;olute monarchy, may be &s;ometimes found.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the un&s;uitablene&s;s of the republican form to the genius of the people, America is too exten&s;ive for it. That form may do well enough for a &s;ingle city, or &s;mall territo|ry; but would be utterly improper for &s;uch a continent as this. America is too unwieldy for the feeble, dilatory ad|mini&s;tration of democracy. Rome had the mo&s;t exten&s;ive dominions of any ancient republic. But it &s;hould be re|membered, that very &s;oon after the &s;pirit of conque&s;t car|ried the Romans beyond the limits that were proportioned to their con&s;titution, they fell under a de&s;potic yoke. A very few years had clap&s;ed from the time of their conquering Greece and fir&s;t entering A&s;ia, till the battle of Pharfalia, where Julius Cae&s;ar put an end to the liberties of his coun|try. Cae&s;ar him&s;elf was the fir&s;t who entirely &s;ubdued the Gauls, though near neighbours, and that penetrated into Britain. Had it not been for the rival&s;hip between Sylla and Marius, who were a check upon each other, Rome had &s;ur|rendered her liberties before to one or other of tho&s;e tyrants. Holland is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable republic in Europe, at pre&s;ent; yet the &s;mall kingdom of Ireland is more than <HI>twice</HI> as large as the <HI>Seven United Provinces.</HI> Holland, in|deed, has con&s;iderable colonies in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies; but the&s;e are under as rigid and arbitrary an admini&s;tration as any colonies of France or Spain.</P>

<P N="6">6. In fine. Let us, for a moment, imagine that an American republic is formed, every ob&s;tacle having been &s;urmounted; yet a very &s;erious article &s;till remains to be en|quired into, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>expence</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it. It be|hoves tho&s;e who have any property, to think of this part of the bu&s;ine&s;s. As for our author, it is more than probable he has nothing to lo&s;e; and like others in the &s;ame predica|ment, is willing to tru&s;t to the chapter of accidents and chances for &s;omething in the &s;cramble. He cannot lo&s;e; but may po&s;&s;ibly again. His own maxim is certainly true&mdash;<Q>The more men have to lo&s;e, the le&s;s willing are they to venture*;</Q> and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> &s;ay I.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain, with preci&s;ion, the ex|pence that would be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of this New Republic. It would be very great undoubtedly&mdash;it would appear intolerable to the Americans, who have hitherto paid &s;o few taxes. I &s;hall ju&s;t hint at a few articles.&mdash;</P>
<P>Our author a&s;&s;erts the nece&s;&s;ity of our having a na|val

force when independent. It is granted&mdash;we could not be without one. The reader, however, will not expect that I &s;hould either adopt, or formally refute his hopeful &s;cheme&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That merchant &s;hips, armed, &s;hall be employed for our defence&mdash;that is to &s;ay&mdash;That &s;hips, when on trading voyages to Europe, Africa, the Ea&s;t or We&s;t Indies, or tak|ing in their ladings at tho&s;e places, &s;hall defend the trade and coa&s;ts of America! <Q>This, he &s;ays, would be uniting the &s;inews of commerce and defence, and making our &s;trength and riches play into each others hands.</Q> The thought, I believe, is original, and the plan entirely his own&mdash;it might entitle him to a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;eat among the &s;age profe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Laputa,</HI> who, according to SWIFT, were employed in <Q>extracting &s;un-beams out of cucumbers, calcining ice in|to gun-powder, and making fire malleable,</Q> and other &s;uch ingenious inventions.</P>
<P>This Gentleman thinks that, <Q>50 or 60 &s;hips, mount|ing 20, 30, 40, or 50 guns, with a few guard-&s;hips, would keep up a &s;ufficient navy.</Q> Let us take a medium of the fir&s;t of tho&s;e numbers, and &s;uppo&s;e the American navy to con&s;i&s;t partly of <HI>fifty-five</HI> &s;hips, each mounting 50 guns. The preci&s;e co&s;t of building a 50 gun &s;hip in Eng|land, is &pound;.14,355 &s;terl. Fifty-five &s;uch &s;hips would co&s;t &pound;.789,525 &s;terling.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome larger &s;hips; not only to act as "guard&s;hips," but to make our navy re&s;pectable, and without which it could nor an&s;wer the intended purpo&s;e. Ships of 74 guns are reckoned the mo&s;t &s;erviceable; and the Briti&s;h navy has at this time no le&s;s than <HI>forty-four</HI> &s;uch, that could be fitted for actual &s;ervice on the &s;horte&s;t notice; be&s;ides about <HI>ten</HI> more of the &s;ame &s;ort, mo&s;t of which could be got ready in a little time. The Ameri|can navy would require at lea&s;t <HI>thirty</HI> of the&s;e, and our har|bours in the middle and &s;outhern colonies, would not conve|niently admit larger &s;hips. The co&s;t of building a 74 gun &s;hip in England, is exactly &pound;.27,200 &s;terl. The co&s;t of 30 &s;uch &s;hips would be &pound;716,000.</P>
<P>To the above &s;hips it would be indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to add &s;ome frigates, which are very u&s;eful in &s;ecuring the &s;eas
<PB N="56" REF="014809_0054_0F94DADDF961D1C0">
and for various kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s where larger &s;hips would be unwieldy, and not an&s;wer &s;o well, Frigates of 32 guns, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0 guns, are reckoned the mo&s;t &s;erviceable. <HI>Twelve</HI> of each &s;ort would be as few as our trade and coa&s;ts would re|quire. The co&s;t of building a 32 gun frigate is &pound;.7480 &s;terl. Twelve &s;uch frigates would amount to &pound;.89,760 &s;terl. The building a 20 gun frigate co&s;ts in England &pound;.4370 &s;terling; twelve &s;uch frigates would amount to &pound;.52,440 &s;terling.</P>
<P>Cannon, &s;mall-arms, ammunition, anchors, cables, &amp;c. are all &s;eparate articles from that of building; and are &s;o ex|pen&s;ive, that a &s;hip of war, when fitted for actual &s;ervice, with &s;ix months pay and provi&s;ions, is generally reckoned, to co&s;t one thou&s;and pounds &s;terling for every gun. But as it would be difficult to a&s;certain preci&s;ely the expence of the&s;e&mdash;or that of docks, ar&s;enals, founderies, rope-walks, manu|factories for &s;ail-cloth, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which are nece&s;&s;ary to|wards keeping up a regular navy, I &s;hall not enter into a minute detail of them; but take them by the gro&s;s, and compute them at a third of the above co&s;t. Con&s;idering the high price of labour in America, this computation will be deemed very moderate.</P>

<P>This number of &s;hips, amounting to <HI>one hundred and nine,</HI> is a very moderate navy indeed for this continent.

<P>The annual expence is next to be con&s;idered. The cer|tain, annual expence of a 50 gun &s;hip in England, and for which provi&s;ion is always made by government, is &pound;.18,200 &s;terl.&mdash;that of a 74 gun &s;hip, is &pound;.33,800 &s;terl. of a 32 gun frigate, &pound;.11,440 &s;terl.&mdash;of a 20 gun frigate, &pound;8,320. This is allowed for wear and tear, victualling and wages. Repairs and expence of ammunition, are different articles; which, as they cannot be a&s;certained, I &s;hall pa&s;s over. The certain annual expence of an American fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of the above &s;hips, would therefore be as follows&mdash;</P>

<P>It is not improbable that the American fleet might very from this li&s;t, as to the number and &s;ize of the &s;everal &s;hips, ju&s;t as circum&s;tances might require: Yet certain I am, that in ca&s;e we became independent of England, a fleet <HI>equal</HI> in force to the above, and attended with <HI>equal</HI> expence, would be inde&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary. If we are to have any foreign commerce, we mu&s;t, like England, Holland, France, &amp;c. keep &s;hips of force in foreign parts, to protect that commerce; be&s;ides tho&s;e which are nece&s;&s;ary to defend our coa&s;ts, har|bours, and trade near home.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering our exten&s;ive line of &s;ea-coa&s;t, and our no le&s;s exten&s;ive frontiers, along which &s;o many thou&s;ands of &s;avages are &s;ettled, I think America, when independent, cannot keep le&s;s than 30 regiments of infantry in con&s;tant pay, each regiment con&s;i&s;ting of 700 men; the whole a|mounting to 21,000 men. The &s;mall republic of Holland has an army of 40,000 men in time of peace. As matters are now circum&s;tanced throughout Chri&s;tendom, no &s;tate can
<PB N="58" REF="014809_0056_0F94DADF7959DAB0">
pre&s;erve its independency without a &s;tanding army. The nation that would neglect to keep one, and a naval force, if it has any &s;ea coa&s;t, mu&s;t infallibly fall a prey to &s;ome of its ambitious and more vigilant neighbours.</P>
<P>The annual expence of an Engli&s;h regiment, con&s;i&s;ting of 700 men, is nearly &pound;.15,743 &s;terl: And the expence of rai&s;ing, cloathing, and arming foot &s;oldiers, is about &pound;.6 a man; which will amount to &pound;4,200 for a regiment of 700 men. Thus the annual expence of 30 regiments would be &pound;.472,290 &s;terl; and the charge of rai&s;ing, arming, &amp;c. would be &pound;.126,000 &s;terl. Moreover we &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome regiments of cavalry, to be di&s;tributed in or near the large towns and cities. Let us &s;uppo&s;e &s;ix re|giments to be rai&s;ed of 300 men each. The annual expence of an Engli&s;h regiment of dragoons, of 300 men, is nearly &pound;.16,187 &s;terl. The annual expence of &s;ix &s;uch regiments would be &pound;.97,122 &s;terl; be&s;ides the charge of hor&s;es, arming, &amp;c. which is computed at 30 guineas per man, and would amount to about &pound;56,700 &s;terl.</P>

However, to avoid fractions, let it be &s;tated at three millions&mdash;even this &s;um carries hor|ror in the very idea of it; and yet many deluded people flat|ter them&s;elves that they will pay no taxes, if we are once In|dependent! Suppo&s;ing then that Canada, Nova-Scotia, and
<PB N="59" REF="014809_0057_0F94DAE039FF1F48">
Florida were joined to the thirteen colonies now united, the number would be &s;ixteen. The above &s;um equally di|vided among them would be &pound;.187,500 &s;terl; which is nearly equal to 833,333 Spani&s;h milled dollars, (reckoning a dollar at 4s.6d. &s;terl.) <HI>annual</HI> expence to each colony. But it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that Rhode-I&s;land is a &s;mall colony&mdash;that the three little counties of Newca&s;tle, Kent and Su&s;&s;ex upon Delaware, are reckoned as a colony&mdash;that Nova-Sco|tia, Georgia and Florida are very young colonies: None of the&s;e therefore could po&s;&s;ibly contribute an equal &s;hare with the older and larger colonies; the expence of the latter mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be proportionably greater, to make up the defi|ciency: Suppo&s;ing the inhabitants of all the&s;e colonies amount to <HI>three millions</HI>&mdash;and I am of opinion their number is not greater&mdash;each individual, man, woman, and child, black and white, would have <HI>twenty &s;hillings</HI> &s;terling, i. e. above four Spani&s;h dollars to pay <HI>annually</HI> for defraying the public ex|pence. Or, taking every &s;eventh per&s;on for a Taxable, which I think is near the u&s;ual proportion, and that this &s;um were to be paid by a Poll-tax, then every Taxable in the colonies mu&s;t pay &pound;.7 &s;terl. i. e. about 32 Spani&s;h dollars <HI>annually</HI> for the public expence, over and above what he has paid in times pa&s;t.

&s;trike; will make a load of debt, that mu&s;t prove ruin|ous to this continent.</P>
<P>I have not knowingly exaggerated a &s;ingle article in the above e&s;timate; and were the trial made, I verily believe the expence would be found much greater. For I have formed this e&s;timate according to the &s;tate of things in England; but it is well known that wages and the price of labour in general, are much higher in America than in England. Labour mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be dear in every country where land is cheap, and large tracts of it un&s;ettled, as is the ca&s;e here. Hence an American regiment co&s;ts us <HI>double</HI> what a Briti&s;h regiment, of equal number, co&s;ts Britain. Were it proper to be explicit, and de&s;cend to particulars, I could evince this pa&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt; and I appeal for the truth of it to tho&s;e gentlemen among us who are acquainted with the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>Where the money is to come from which will defray this enormous annual expence of <HI>three millions,</HI> &s;terling, and all tho&s;e other debts, I know not; unle&s;s the author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> or &s;ome other ingenious projector, can di&s;cover the <HI>Philo&s;opher's Stone,</HI> by which iron and other ba&s;e metals may be tran&s;muted into gold. Certain I am, that our commerce and agriculture, the two principal &s;ources of our wealth, will not &s;upport &s;uch an expence. The whole of our ex|ports from the Thirteen United Colonies in the year 1769, amounted only to &pound;.2,887,898 &s;terl.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Campbell's Political Survey of Great-Britain,</HI> Vol. 2.</NOTE>; which is not &s;o much, by near half a million, as our annual expence would be, were we Independent of Great-Britain. Tho&s;e exports, with no incon&s;iderable part of the profits ari&s;ing from them, it is well known, centered finally in Britain, to pay the merchants and manufacturers there for goods we had im|ported thence; and yet left us &s;till in debt! What then mu&s;t our &s;ituation be, or what the &s;tate of our trade, when op|pre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a burthen of annual expence! When eve|ry article of commerce, every nece&s;&s;ary of life, together with our lands, mu&s;t be heavily taxed, to defray that expence!</P>
<P>Such is the load of debt and expence we &s;hould incur by this Writer's hopeful exchange of our connection with Great
<PB N="61" REF="014809_0059_0F94DAE1B956C988">
Britain for Independency and Republicani&s;m! And all this, after being exhau&s;ted by a tedious war, and perhaps our &s;hipping and &s;ea-ports de&s;troyed! This is a very &s;erious mat|ter; which is obvious to every under&s;tanding, and which no &s;ophi&s;try can evade. All who have any prudence or com|mon &s;en&s;e left, or any property to lo&s;e, will pau&s;e and con|&s;ider well, before they plunge them&s;elves into &s;uch a dread|ful &s;ituation. How little do tho&s;e who de&s;ire this &s;ituation, know what they are about, or what they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Our author frequently refers us to Holland, as if that were the only land of liberty&mdash;crowned with every ble&s;&s;ing, and exempt from every evil. But hear a little plain truth. The national debt of Holland is much greater, in propor|tion, than that of England. The taxes in Holland far ex|ceed not only tho&s;e in England, but even tho&s;e in France, in&s;omuch that a certain writer declares he &s;carcely knows any thing they have which has e&s;caped taxation, "except the air they breathe." Navy more,&mdash;the people at large have no voice in chu&s;ing the members of their &s;everal Senates, as we have in chu&s;ing Repre&s;entatives. The members of each Senate, upon any vacancy, elect new members; and the deputies from tho&s;e Senates, con&s;titute the <HI>States Gene|ral.</HI> So that in fact, the people have no &s;hare in the government, as with us; "they have nothing to do but pay and grumble," as Lord Che&s;terfield ob&s;erves. Yet this is the country our author holds up for imitation; and if we were to follow his advice, I have not the lea&s;t doubt but we &s;hould &s;oon re&s;emble them in paying heavy taxes, as well as in every other matter.</P>
<P>But here it may be &s;aid&mdash;<HI>That all the evils above &s;pecified, are more tolerable than &s;lavery.</HI> With this &s;entiment I &s;in|cerely agree&mdash;any hard&s;hips, however great, are preferable to &s;lavery. But then I a&s;k, is there no other alternative in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? Is there no choice left us but &s;lavery, or tho&s;e evils? I am confident there is; and that both may be equally avoided? Let us only &s;hew a di&s;po&s;ition to treat or negociate in earne&s;t&mdash;let us fall upon &s;ome method to &s;et a treaty or negociation with Great Britain on foot; and if once properly begun, there is a moral certainly that this
<PB N="62" REF="014809_0060_0F94DAE27957BBB8">
un|happy di&s;pute will be &s;ettled to the mutual &s;atisfaction and intere&s;t of both countries. For my part, I have not the lea&s;t doubt about it.</P>
<P>It would be improper and needle&s;s for me to enlarge on the particulars that &s;hould be adju&s;ted at &s;uch a treaty. The mature&s;t deliberation will be nece&s;&s;ary on the occa&s;ion, as well as a generous regard to every part of the Empire, I &s;hall ju&s;t beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t my opinion on a few points&mdash;I think America &s;hould in&s;i&s;t, that the claim of parliament|ary taxation be either explicitly relinqui&s;hed; or el&s;e, &s;uch &s;ecurity given as the ca&s;e will admit, and may be equivalent to a formal relinqui&s;hment, that this claim &s;hall not be ex|erted. When this mo&s;t important point is gained, America &s;hould con&s;ider, that there is a great difference between having her money wre&s;ted from her by others, and not giv|ing any of it her&s;elf, when it is proper to give. While &s;he is protected, and &s;hares in the advantages re&s;ulting from be|ing a part of the Briti&s;h Empire, &s;he &s;hould contribute &s;ome|thing for that protection and tho&s;e advantages; and I never heard a &s;en&s;ible American deny this. Moreover, &s;he &s;hould &s;tipulate for &s;uch a freedom of trade as is con&s;i&s;tent with the general welfare of the State; and that this intere&s;ting object be &s;ettled in &s;uch a manner as to preclude, as much as po&s;&s;ible, any impolitic, or injurious infringements here|after. All this may be ea&s;ily done, if both &s;ides are only di&s;po&s;ed for peace; and there are many other particulars which would be exceedingly beneficial to America, and might be obtained, as they could not interfere with the in|tere&s;t of Great Britain or any other part of the empire. We have abundant proof of this as well as &s;everal good hints to proceed on, in the late conce&s;&s;ions to Nova-Scotia from government.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked&mdash;what probability is there that Bri|tain will enter on &s;uch a treaty, or li&s;ten to propo&s;als of this kind? Is &s;he not preparing for war, and fitting out a for|midable armament again&s;t the colonies? I an&s;wer&mdash;there is every rea&s;on to believe that &s;he will enter on &s;uch a treaty, if it is de&s;ired; and that &s;he will li&s;ten to rea&s;onable propo|&s;als. It is her intere&s;t to do &s;o. To hold the&s;e colonies

by the &s;word only, were &s;he ever &s;o powerful, would be holding them by a very precarious, expen&s;ive tenure. Such a Union with the Colonies as well promote their intere&s;t equally with her's, is the only effectual way of attaching them to her. Is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that Great Britain does not &s;ee this? Or that &s;he is not &s;en&s;ible of it? Be&s;ides, it has been openly and expre&s;sly declared in Parliament that <HI>taxation is given up</HI> by the Mini&s;try; we are al&s;o a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome very re&s;pectable names have been lately added to the ad|vocates of America; and Commi&s;&s;ioners have been appointed to treat with us. All the&s;e things are in our favour, and promi&s;e a pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue to a negociation, if once begun. The Briti&s;h armament will not in the lea&s;t impede a treaty. Belligerent-Powers, when on the eve of peace, always make as vigorous preparations for war, as if there was no thoughts of peace. America al&s;o is preparing for war, which is no more than a prudent &s;tep. It need not prevent her from treating; and &s;he may thereby obtain better terms.</P>
<P>But a Declaration for Independency on the part of Ame|rica, would preclude treaty intirely; and could an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e. We actually have already every advantage of Independency, without its inconveniences. By a Decla|ration of Independency, we &s;hould in&s;tantly lo&s;e all a&s;&s;i&s;tance from our friends in England. It would &s;top their mouths; for were they to &s;ay any thing in our favour, they would be deemed rebels, and treated accordingly.</P>
<P>Our author is much elated with the pro&s;pect of foreign &s;uc|cour, if we once declare our&s;elves Independent; and from thence promi&s;eth us mighty matters. This, no doubt, is intended to &s;pirit up the de&s;ponding&mdash;all who might &s;hrink at the thought of America encountering, &s;ingly and un&s;upported, the whole &s;trength of Great-Britain. I believe in my con&s;cience, that he is as much mi&s;taken in this, as in any thing el&s;e; and that this expectation is delu&s;ive, vain and fallacious. My rea&s;ons are the&s;e, and I &s;ubmit them to the readers judgement.</P>
<P>The only European power from which we can po&s;&s;ibly receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is France. But France is now at peace with Great-Britain; and is it probable that France would interrupt that peace, and hazard a war with the power which lately
<PB N="64" REF="014809_0062_0F94DAE3F959D2E0">
reduced her &s;o low, from a <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> motive of aiding and protecting the&s;e Colonies? The fate of Cor&s;ica may teach us how <HI>ready</HI> European &s;tates are to act on <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> motives, in &s;uch ca&s;es. France has now a pacific King; her finances are in a very ruinous &s;tate; both which circum&s;tances will naturally tend to keep her quiet. If it be &s;aid&mdash;That the exclu&s;ive trade of America would be a &s;ufficient inducement for France to engage on our &s;ide&mdash;I an&s;wer&mdash;That &s;he never can have our exclu&s;ive trade, till the power of Great-Britain is totally annihilated. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing France were able to effect this&mdash;(a &s;uppo&s;ition not very probable)&mdash;yet the other European &s;tates are too jealous of her&mdash;too deeply intere&s;ted in pre&s;erving a due ballance of power, which is a principal object in European politics, ever to &s;uffer &s;uch an event to take place.</P>
<P>It is well known that &s;ome of the French and Spani&s;h Coloni&s;ts, not long &s;ince, offered to put them&s;elves under the protection of England, and declare them&s;elves Independent of France and Spain; but England rejected both offers. The example would be rather dangerous to &s;tates that have colo|nies&mdash;to none could it be more &s;o than to France and Spain, who have &s;o many and &s;uch exten&s;ive colonies. <Q>The practice of courts are as much again&s;t us</Q> in this, as in the in&s;tance our author mentions. Can any one ima|gine, that becau&s;e we declared our&s;elves Independent of England, France would <HI>therefore</HI> con&s;ider us as really Inde|pendent! And before England had acquie&s;ced, or made any effort worth mentioning to reduce us? Or can any one be &s;o weak as to think, that France would run the ri&s;que of a war with England, unle&s;s &s;he (France) were &s;ure of &s;ome extraordinary advantage by it, in having the colonies un|der her <HI>immediate juri&s;diction?</HI> If England will not protect us for our trade, &s;urely France will not.</P>
<P>But I have &s;ome <HI>facts</HI> to alledge further on this head, which will have great weight with all &s;ober, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;ons. As for tho&s;e who give them&s;elves up to pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice, they are &s;carcely capable of judging. Like men who are drawn in and whirled about, by &s;ome impetuous vortex, they have lo&s;t the proper command of them&s;elves.</P>

The &s;everal European &s;tates who have colonies on this continent, or the adjacent i&s;lands, are exceedingly jealous of tho&s;e colonies, left they &s;hould a&s;pire to independency. He mu&s;t be totally ignorant of the &s;tate of things in Europe who is not &s;en&s;ible of this. The great di&s;tance of America from Europe contributes to rai&s;e that jealou&s;y; and it is height|ened by our growing &s;trength and importance, and our en|terprizing &s;pirit. Hence it was that France lately &s;ent &s;uch a number of regular troops to Martinico; and di&s;armed all the inhabitants, to whom the defence of that i&s;land was chiefly committed formerly. The profe&s;&s;ed rea&s;on for di&s;|arming the inhabitants was to prevent their joining the North Americans in their conte&s;t with Great-Britain. This infor|mation comes from a gentleman who was then at Martinico, and lately arrived on this continent. The inhabitants of the French We&s;t-Indies, it is probable, would willingly join us, and &s;hake off the de&s;potic yoke under which they groan; but this di&s;po&s;ition in them will only &s;erve to alarm France the more, and induce the latter to oppo&s;e, rather than a&s;&s;i&s;t us.</P>
<P>Di&s;countenancing <HI>our</HI> independency by France, would only be &s;uch a return as Britain will naturally expect, and mo&s;t probably receive, for a &s;imilar conduct in her to the French inhabitants of Hi&s;paniola. Not long after the conclu&s;ion of the late war, tho&s;e inhabitants were driven by the mo&s;t gla|ring oppre&s;&s;ion, to take up arms. The French Governor applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Engli&s;h Admiral, then on the We&s;t-India &s;tation. Several &s;hips were &s;ent immediately by the latter, with the promi&s;e of more, if nece&s;&s;ary. The in|&s;urrection was quelled by the Governor's in&s;idiou&s;ly drawing the leaders of the in&s;urrection into a treaty, and then making pri&s;oners of them&mdash;a circum&s;tance not very inviting to place much faith in French promi&s;es or genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>The King of Denmark's late proclamation, in which he declares, that <HI>the e&s;tates of &s;uch of his &s;ubjects as &s;hall join the Americans, will be forfeited,</HI> is a further proof of the di&s;po|&s;ition of European powers, who have &s;ettlements in America.</P>
<P>Let any man calmly reflect on the&s;e particulars; and then judge whether it is probable that France or any other Euro|pean
<PB N="66" REF="014809_0064_0F94DAE579681F08">
&s;tate that has profe&s;&s;ions on this quarter of the globe, will contribute to erect an independent empire in America; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that this new empire, from its proximity, mu&s;t, &s;ooner or later, infallibly &s;wallow up tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. I am firmly of opinion, that our Decla|ration of Independency will have an effect directly contrary to what our author &s;ugge&s;ts, and what &s;ome warm people expect. I think it infinitely more likely that it will produce a coalition or treaty between the &s;everal European nations, who have &s;ettlements in America, to guarantee and &s;ecure their re&s;pective &s;ettlements to each other; than that any of the&s;e nations will co-operate with our de&s;ign, and thereby lend a hand to injure them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nay, further; I can whi&s;per a &s;ecret to the author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> provided he will let it go no further&mdash;which is&mdash;That France and Spain have <HI>actually made an offer of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> to Great-Britain, in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t with the Colonies. This intelligence comes from &s;uch authority as would remove all doubt about the matter, even from our zealous Republican, were I at liberty to mention that autho|rity.</P>
<P>Indeed were France ever &s;o willing and able to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, the experiment would be imprudent in us, and hazard|ous to the highe&s;t degree. There is &s;carcely an in&s;tance recorded in hi&s;tory of Foreigners being called in to a&s;&s;i&s;t in dome&s;tic quarrels, that it did not prove ruinous to tho&s;e that &s;ought their aid. The ancient Britons invited the Saxons to a&s;&s;i&s;t them again&s;t the Picts&mdash;the Picts were &s;ub|dued; and the Britons en&s;laved. One in&s;tance more I can|not forbear mentioning. The Etolians and other Greek &s;tates called in the Romans to a&s;&s;i&s;t them again&s;t Philip of Macedon, one of Alexander's Succe&s;&s;ors. Philip was redu|ced; and the Roman yoke was impo&s;ed on the Grecian &s;tates. Sen&s;ible of their error, when it was too late, and anxious for deliverance from the Romans, the Etolians applied for Aid to Antiochus, who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the remains of Alexander's A&s;iatic Dominions. The Romans now em|ployed Philip to &s;ubdue Antiochus and the Etolians, as be|fore they had employed the Etolians to &s;ubdue Philip. The
<PB N="67" REF="014809_0065_0F94DAE639D38B08">
Roman yoke was more confirmed and made heavier. Were we to call in France on this occa&s;ion; and &s;hould our uni|ted force &s;ucceed again&s;t Britain, &s;omething &s;imilar to this would probably follow.</P>
<P>I have heard the ca&s;e of Holland's revolt from Spain, and Queen Elizabeth's affording aid to the former, mentio|ned as parallel to ours. But in&s;tead of being parallel, the ca&s;es differ in every circum&s;tance. Elizabeth, embarra&s;&s;ed greatly by Roman Catholics at home, was then at war with Philip IId. of Spain&mdash;a cruel, gloomy tyrant, who had late|ly introduced the inqui&s;ition into the low countries, where hundreds of his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects were &s;acrificed by that bloody court. This was the real cau&s;e of the Dutch revolt; though civil matters partly mingled with it. Elizabeth by a&s;|&s;i&s;ting the Dutch, &s;erved two important purpo&s;es. One was to protect the prote&s;tants who were every where threatned with de&s;truction. The other was, to di&s;tre&s;s her implaca|ble enemy, who aimed at no le&s;s than the utter ruin of her religion, crown and kingdom. The Dutch &s;tates offered Elizabeth the &s;overeignty of their country; but &s;he refu&s;ed it, having no de&s;ign of that &s;ort. It is more than probable the French king would not be &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted, mode&s;t and &s;elf-denying as Elizabeth was, were we to make him the like offer. Such was the ca&s;e of Holland; yet &s;ome have been &s;o &s;illy as to compare our pre&s;ent ca&s;e with that of the Dutch.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider this matter as you will, view the Declaration of Independency in what light you plea&s;e; the ruin of Ameri|ca mu&s;t be the inevitable con&s;equence. Our author's ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and zeal therefore, that we &s;hould declare our&s;elves Independent, &s;erves only to prove that he him&s;elf is de&s;pe|rate; and that he would gladly bring this whole continent in|to the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>
<P>But our author repeatedly tells us&mdash;<Q>That to expend &s;o many millions for the &s;ake of getting a few vile acts re|pealed, is unworthy of the charge.</Q> Now to pa&s;s over the gro&s;s in&s;ult here offered to the Continental Congre&s;s, who had this important object principally in view, in the &s;pirited mea&s;ures they have taken: I an&s;wer&mdash;That if five times as many millions had been expended, America would be an

immen&s;e gainer, provided tho&s;e acts are repealed, and her liberties, property, and trade, and &s;ettled on a firm ba&s;is, by a Con&s;titutional Union with Great-Britain. Were that mea|&s;ure once effected, the peace and pro&s;perity of this continent would be as immutably and certainly &s;ecure as any thing in this world can. We &s;hould be the happie&s;t people in the world. The Americans have fully evinced, to the convic|tion of the mo&s;t incredulous, that they have an high &s;en&s;e of their liberties, and &s;ufficient &s;pirit to vindicate tho&s;e li|berties. Their numbers, &s;trength, and importance, will be daily increa&s;ing; the&s;e will command re&s;pect from Great|Britain, and in&s;ure to them a mild and equitable treatment from her. She will not hereafter be over anxious to con|tend, or come to blows with them. This I think is clear to demon&s;tration; and hence we may learn to &s;et a proper value on the rant which this author throws out, as if Ame|rica would be perpetually embroiled with England hereafter, unle&s;s we declare for independency.</P>
<P>For my part, I look upon this pamphlet to be the mo&s;t injurious, in every re&s;pect, to America, of any that has appeared &s;ince the&s;e troubles began. Its natural and nece&s;|&s;ary tendency is, to produce jealou&s;y, di&s;&s;ention and di&s;union among us. The Continental Congre&s;s, the &s;everal Provin|cial Congre&s;&s;es and A&s;&s;emblies, have all unanimou&s;ly and in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, di&s;claimed every idea of Independency. They have repeatedly declared their abhorrence of &s;uch a &s;tep; they have as often declared their firm attachment to our Sovereign and the Parent State. They have declared that placing them in the &s;ame &s;ituation that they were at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war, was their only object; that when this was done, by repealing the obnoxious acts, our former har|mony and friend&s;hip would be re&s;tored. I appeal to the reader whether all this has not been done from one end of the continent to the other.</P>
<P>Yet here &s;teps forth a writer, who avers with as much a&s;|&s;urance as if he had the whole continent at his back, and ready to &s;upport his a&s;&s;everations.&mdash;That Independency is our duty and intere&s;t&mdash;That it was folly and ra&s;hne&s;s to go to the expence we have been at for &s;ake of repealing tho&s;e
<PB N="69" REF="014809_0067_0F94DAE7B9700678">
obnoxious acts; and moreover, loads with the mo&s;t oppro|brious terms, that Sovereign and Nation to which we had de|clared our attachment! In what light can this be viewed in Britain? Mu&s;t it not weaken the influence of our friends&mdash;&s;trengthen the hands of the mini&s;try&mdash;and give weight to every thing our enemies have &s;aid to our di&s;advantage? Mu&s;t it not induce people to &s;u&s;pect our candour&mdash;that all our declarations were in&s;incere, fallacious&mdash;intended only to a|mu&s;e and deceive?&mdash;It is as much to vindicate my injured countrymen from this di&s;grace, which they de&s;erve not, as to oppo&s;e the de&s;tructive project of Independency, that I ap|pear on this occa&s;ion&mdash;a project which is as <HI>new</HI> as it is de|&s;tructive.</P>
<P>I have now con&s;idered every thing in this Incendiary's pamphlet, that de&s;erves notice. If &s;ome things are pa&s;&s;ed over, it is not becau&s;e they are unan&s;werable; but becau&s;e they are not worthy of an an&s;wer. I have on purpo&s;e omit|ted every &s;ubject, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which might tend to rai&s;e jealou&s;y among the coloni&s;ts; &s;uch as religion, the claims of &s;ome colonies on others, be&s;ides many more of the &s;ame kind. But it was more difficult to avoid &s;peaking of the&s;e, than to point out what prolific &s;ources of animo&s;ity, bitterne&s;s and bloody conte&s;ts they mu&s;t infallibly prove, were America to become independent. The whole is freely &s;ubmitted to the reader's candid, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate judgment.</P>
<P>The Author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> may probably call me <Q>a di&s;gui&s;ed tory, a prejudiced man,</Q> or what in his e&s;timation <Q>will be productive of more calamities to this continent than all others&mdash;a moderate man.</Q> But I am too con&s;cious of the &s;incerity of my own heart, and of the rectitude of my intentions, to pay any regard to whatever he is plea&s;ed to call me. Who indeed would be ambitious of his appro|bation, when he expre&s;sly reprobates Moderation&mdash;that offspring of true wi&s;dom and &s;ound judgment? The welfare of America is what I wi&s;h for above any earthly thing. I am fully, firmly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly per&s;uaded, that our author's &s;cheme of Independency and Republicani&s;m, is big with ruin&mdash;with inevitable ruin to America. Again&s;t this &s;cheme therefore, which totally changes the ground we &s;et
<PB N="70" REF="014809_0068_0F94DAE8799AE320">
out on, as an hone&s;t man, as a friend to human nature, I mu&s;t and will bear te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Let the &s;pirit, de&s;ign and motives which are undeniably evident in our re&s;pective pamphlets, decide which &s;hould be attended to mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The author of <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> is a violent &s;tickler for Democracy or Republicani&s;m only&mdash;every other &s;pecies of government is reprobated by him as tyrannical: <HI>I</HI> plead for that con&s;titution which has been formed by the wi&s;dom of ages&mdash;is the admiration of mankind&mdash;is be&s;t adapted to the genius of Britons, and is mo&s;t friendly to liberty.</P>
<P><HI>He</HI> takes plea&s;ure in aggravating every circum&s;tance of our unhappy di&s;pute&mdash;would in&s;pire others with the &s;ame rage that in&s;tigates him&s;elf, and would &s;et his fellow &s;ubjects to cutting each others throats. <HI>I</HI> would mo&s;t gladly, were it in my power, draw a veil of eternal oblivion over any er|rors which Great Britain or the colonies may have fallen into&mdash;I would willingly per&s;uade them to mutual harmony and union; &s;ince on the&s;e their mutual happine&s;s and inte|re&s;t depend.</P>
<P><HI>He</HI> is evidently goaded on by ambition and re&s;entment, to &s;eek for the gratification of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions in an independent republic here; which would reduce America to the &s;ame de&s;perate &s;tate with him&s;elf: <HI>I</HI> have no intere&s;t to &s;erve but what is common to my countrymen&mdash;but what every Ame|rican of property is concerned in equally with me.</P>
<P><HI>He</HI> places him&s;elf at the head of a party; and &s;purns from him with the utmo&s;t contempt and indignation, all who will not enli&s;t under his banner: <HI>I</HI> am of no party, but &s;o far as the welfare of America is aimed at; and I believe there are many who aim at this in every party. I have not learnt to pace with &s;uch intire acquie&s;cence in the trammels of any party, as not to de&s;ert it, the moment it de&s;erts the intere&s;t of my country.</P>
<P><HI>He</HI> recommends a new, untried romantic &s;cheme, at which we would at fir&s;t have &s;huddered&mdash;which is big with in|evitable ruin, and is the la&s;t &s;tage of political phrenzy. <HI>I</HI> am for pur&s;uing the &s;ame object, and acting on the &s;ame princi|ples and plan with which we &s;et out, when this conte&s;t began, and of who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s there is a moral certainty.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="014809_0069_0F94DAE93A9B6718">
This, as far as I can know or &s;ee, is the true &s;tate of our ca&s;e&mdash;let Heaven and Earth judge between us.</P>
<P>America is far from being yet in a de&s;perate &s;ituation. I am confident &s;he may obtain honourable and advantagious terms from Great Britain. A few years of peace will &s;oon retrieve all her lo&s;&s;es. She will rapidly advance to a &s;tate of maturity, whereby &s;he may not only repay the parent &s;tate amply for all pa&s;t benefits; but al&s;o lay under the greate&s;t obligations. America, till very lately, has been the hap|pie&s;t country in the univer&s;e. Ble&s;t with all that nature could be&s;tow with the profu&s;e&s;t bounty, &s;he enjoyed be|&s;ides, more liberty, greater privileges than any other land. How painful is it to reflect on the&s;e things, and to look for|ward to the gloomy pro&s;pects now before us! But it is not too late to hope that matters may mend. By prudent ma|nagement her former happine&s;s may again return; and con|tinue to encrea&s;e for ages to come, in a union with the pa|rent &s;tate.</P>
<P>However di&s;tant humanity may wi&s;h the period; yet, in the rotation of human affairs, a period may arrive, when, (both countries being prepared for it) &s;ome terrible di&s;a&s;ter, &s;ome dreadful convul&s;ion in Great Britain, may transfer the &s;eat of empire to this we&s;tern hemi&s;phere&mdash;where the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, like the Phoenix from its parent's a&s;hes, &s;hall ri&s;e with youthful vigour and &s;hine with redoubled &s;plendor.</P>
<P>But if America &s;hould now mi&s;take her real intere&s;t&mdash;if her &s;ons, infatuated with romantic notions of conque&s;t and empire, ere things are ripe, &s;hould adopt this repub|lican's &s;cheme: They will infalibly de&s;troy this &s;miling pro|&s;pect. They will di&s;member this happy country&mdash;make it a &s;cene of blood and &s;laughter, and entail wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery on millions yet unborn.</P>
