<P><HI>AS this di&s;cour&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly fall into the hands of &s;ome who have not &s;een the account of the Life and Crimes of I&s;aac Fra&s;ier, which was publi&s;hed on the day of his Execution, it is thought proper that &s;ome of the principal Facts relating to him &s;hould be here in&s;erted.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He was born at North-King&s;ton, in the Colony of Rhode-I&s;land, Feb.</HI> 9, 1740. <HI>His Father died while he was a Child, and his Mother's poverty obliged her to bind him out as an apprentice at the age of eight Years. He was &s;o unhappy as to be brought up in an irreligious Family, in which he was not &s;o much as taught to read, nor had any religious In&s;tructions given him: He was never &s;ent to any place of public Wor&s;hip, tho' he lived near enough to have con&s;tantly attended it. In con&s;equence of the&s;e things he was entirely ignorant of the fir&s;t Principles of Religion. He early di&s;|covered a thievi&s;h Di&s;po&s;ition. His Mother corrected him for this when he lived with her; but after he left her, he met with no re|&s;traints: On the contrary, his Mi&s;tre&s;s would receive the things he had &s;tolen, and even employ him to &s;teal &s;mall things for her.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A foundation being thus laid, as he advanced in years he grew in wickedne&s;s: From &s;tealing Trifles he proceeded to &s;teal things of Value. At length he went into the practice of breaking open and robbing Hou&s;es; and was in near thirty In&s;tances guilty of Bur|glary. He was fir&s;t convicted of this Crime at New-Haven, and was whipt, cropt, and branded. After committing the &s;ame Crime in a number of In&s;tances, he was pro&s;ecuted to a &s;econd Conviction at Fairfield in Augu&s;t, 1766. He here received the &s;ame puni&s;h|ment as before, and was &s;olemnly warned that death would be his puni&s;hment on a third Conviction: Yet he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in the Prac|tice, and committed ten or a dozen Burglaries between his &s;econd and third Conviction; at length he was committed to pri&s;on for
<PB REF="010926_0003_0F852BE59C0A1DA8">
breaking up a Shop in Fairfield in the night, and robbing it of Goods to the value of an hundred pounds lawful money. Soon after his impri&s;onment, he &s;et fire to the Goal at midnight, and con&s;umed it with the Goaler's appartment and the Court Hou&s;e. He was tried at Fairfield, April</HI> 27, 1768, <HI>on two &s;everal Indictments, the one for Burglary in the third In&s;tance, the other for burning the Goal, &amp;c. found guilty on both, and received Sentence of Death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Government of Connecticut have always been remarkably tender of putting per&s;ons to Death. Such was the lenity of the Judges in this Ca&s;e, that the Warrant for Execution was not &s;igned till four Months after Sentence. By this means opportunity was given the Pri&s;oner to apply for mercy to the General A&s;&s;embly, with whom the Power of pardoning &s;uch offences is lodged. He petiti|oned accordingly; but his Offences were &s;o many and great, that it was tho't nece&s;&s;ary to leave him to &s;uffer. During this Period he found means to break the Goal at New-Haven, which had been the Place of his Confinement &s;ince his burning that at Fairfield. The &s;econd Night after his E&s;cape, he broke open and robbed three Shops at Middletown. After committing &s;everal other Thefts, he was bro't back to the Goal from whence he e&s;caped, and ordered to be executed at Fairfield on the</HI> 7<HI>th of September. As he had before broken out of five or &s;ix different Pri&s;ons, he &s;eems to have flattered him&s;elf with the hope of making one more E&s;cape. And this hope, 'tis tho't by many, did not leave him till the day of Execution. But when he found he mu&s;t die, he behaved with decency and an appear|ance of Concern, both at the Sermon (which was preached at his de&s;ire) and at the Place of Execution.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Exce&s;&s;ive Wickedne&s;s, the Way to an untimely Death.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ECCLESIASTES, vii. 17.</BIBL>
<Q><L>"Be not over-much wicked; neither be thou fooli&s;h:</L>
<L>"Why &s;houlde&s;t thou die before thy Time?"</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the melancholy occa&s;ion on which we are now a&s;&s;em|bled, requires a plain &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uch an one as is adapted not to gratify curio&s;ity, but to lead us to a reli|gious improvement of the awful &s;ight now before our eyes; I &s;hall not &s;pend any part of the little time allowed me, in critical remarks on the words now read, or on their connec|tion with tho&s;e that go before, or that follow them; nor &s;hall I entertain you with the opinion of this or the other learned expo&s;itor concerning them. The plain and obvious &s;en&s;e of the words, and what mu&s;t immediately &s;trike the mind of every one that attentively hears or reads them is, <HI>That exce&s;s in wickedne&s;s is the height of folly, becau&s;e it tends to, and is likely to end in an untimely death.</HI> This is a truth worthy of our &s;erious con&s;ideration at all times, but e&s;pecially on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, when we are come together to &s;ee it verified in a particular in&s;tance. I hope therefore for your &s;erious attention while I endeavour to illu&s;trate this truth, by &s;hewing,</P>
<P>I. When a man may be &s;aid to be "over-much wicked." And,</P>
<P>II. That an untimely death is what this leads to, and is likely to end in&mdash;and while I apply the&s;e things to the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010926_0005_0F852BE799411298">
I. I am then, in the fir&s;t place, to explain the expre&s;&s;ion of being "over-much wicked;" or, to &s;hew, when this may be &s;aid of any per&s;on in particular. To which it may be &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">1. A man may be "over-much wicked" in re&s;pect to the <HI>kind</HI> or &s;ort of &s;in he commits.</P>
<P>Sin is ju&s;tly &s;tiled "the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law." And the word <HI>tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> implies <HI>exce&s;s</HI> or going too far; it means <HI>going beyond</HI> the bounds or limits pre&s;cribed. All &s;ins of com|mi&s;&s;ion, all offences again&s;t negative precepts, do therefore con&s;i&s;t in exce&s;s. When the divine law &s;ays, "Thou &s;halt not" do this or that, he that does it tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the law, he pa&s;&s;es over or goes beyond the bounds &s;et him. So that e|very tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion may be &s;aid to be over-much.</P>
<P>But yet all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are not equal: Some have greater evil in them than others. He that commits one &s;in, does in|deed as really tran&s;gre&s;s the Divine Law as he that com|mits another; for the law allows of no &s;in at all: But in &s;ome kinds of &s;in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is greater, or there is a further departure from the rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s; and con|&s;equently &s;ome &s;ins do in their nature or kind imply greater exce&s;s than others. And a man may he &s;aid to be "over-much wicked" on account of the &s;ort or kind of &s;in he com|mits.</P>
<P>In &s;ins again&s;t the &s;econd table of the moral law, the comparative evil, or the degree in which one &s;in exceeds ano|ther, may be judged of by the damage or injury done either to a particular per&s;on or to the public. The Divine Law which requires me to "love my neighbour as my&s;elf," and forbids my hating any per&s;on, is tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by hatred ex|pre&s;&s;ed in reproachful and provoking words; but the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion is not &s;o great, as when hatred is di&s;covered by rob|bing him of his goods, burning his hou&s;e, wounding his per&s;on, or taking away his life. In the&s;e ca&s;es the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="7" REF="010926_0006_0F852BE888608030">
or exce&s;s is proportioned to the injury done to a par|ticular per&s;on. But then crimes are likewi&s;e to be con&s;ider|ed as they affect the community. And in this view &s;ome of them have a greater degree of evil in them, or are more ex|ce&s;&s;ively wicked than others. Every thing that di&s;turbs the peace and &s;afety of the public is evil. Now this is done by tattling, tale-bearing, lying and defamation; whence it is that the&s;e kinds of vices are puni&s;hable as breaches of the peace. But the happine&s;s of mankind, con&s;idered as form|ed into &s;ociety, is much more affected by robbery, burglary, burning hou&s;es, and &s;uch like crimes, which are therefore ju&s;tly e&s;teemed greater tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. And indeed if men cannot be &s;ecure in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, if they cannot re&s;t &s;afely in their beds, but mu&s;t be in continual danger of having their hou&s;es broken open and plundered, or burnt over their heads, while they are a&s;leep, the happine&s;s of &s;ociety is at an end, and government is in effect di&s;&s;olved; for &s;uch a &s;tate is little, if at all, better than a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>A per&s;on therefore who commits the&s;e greater offences, the&s;e more enormous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, may well be con&s;idered as being "over-much wicked."</P>
<P N="2">2. The man is over-much wicked who repeatedly and frequently commits the &s;ame crime.</P>
<P>The frequent repetition of any fault renders a per&s;on highly criminal. A man by the long and habitual practice of wickedne&s;s of the lower kinds, may contract greater guilt and expo&s;e him&s;elf to a more &s;evere condemnation, than would have re&s;ulted from the commi&s;&s;ion of a much greater crime in a &s;ingle in&s;tance. A truth worthy of the very &s;erious con|&s;ideration of all &s;uch per&s;ons as indulge them&s;elves in &s;maller &s;ins, and think they are &s;ecure &s;o long as they ab&s;tain from gro&s;s and &s;candalous violations of the Divine Law.</P>
<P>Now if a man become "wicked over-much" by frequently
<PB N="8" REF="010926_0007_0F852BE915A07408">
repeating and living long in the practice of &s;ins of a lower kind, what amazing guilt mu&s;t he contract, and what an awful condemnation has he to expect, who lives long in the habitual practice of great tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, or frequently repeats the &s;ame enormous crimes? When &s;uch vices as imply great exce&s;s in the very nature of them, are frequently re|peated and long lived in, it cannot be doubted that men are "over-much wicked." They are &s;o in the &s;ight of GOD, the unerring Judge of the World. Hence that threatning, "But GOD &s;hall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy &s;calp of &s;uch an one as goeth on &s;till in his tre&s;pa&s;&s;es."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxviii. 21.</NOTE> All the enemies of GOD &s;hall be de&s;troyed, but this &s;hall e&s;pecially be the ca&s;e of him that <HI>goeth on &s;till</HI> in his tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. The man that frequently commits the &s;ame &s;in, or lives in the habitu|al practice of it, &s;hall by no means e&s;cape. And hence ap|pears the ju&s;tice of tho&s;e human laws which inflict higher puni&s;hments on a &s;econd or third conviction of the &s;ame crimes.</P>
<P N="3">3. Men are "over-much wicked" when they per&s;i&s;t in their &s;inful practices, notwith&s;tanding their having had plain and repeated warnings of their danger.</P>
<P>A man mu&s;t be &s;tupid to a degree that can &s;carce be &s;up|po&s;ed, who goes on for any con&s;iderable time, in the practice of gro&s;s wickedne&s;s, without feeling &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s in his own mind, on the account of it. There are &s;ea&s;ons in which con&s;cience mu&s;t awake, and when it will be heard. Or, if the con&s;ciences of &s;inners are ever &s;o hardened and even "&s;eared with an hot iron," yet when they practi&s;e &s;uch crimes as expo&s;e them to the &s;troke of human laws, they mu&s;t &s;ure|ly have at &s;ome times very unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions, and even di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fears of being detected. "In the dark they dig through hou&s;es which they had marked for them&s;elves in
<PB N="9" REF="010926_0008_0F852BE9DBF68DD8">
the day-time: They know not the light. For the morning is to them as the &s;hadow of death: If one know them, they are in the terrors of the &s;hadow of death."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxiv. 16, 17.</NOTE> One would imagine, did not experience prove the contrary, that the thief who had been in great danger of being detected, and had felt the&s;e TERRORS OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, &s;hould "&s;teal no more, but labour working with his hands," for his &s;upport. And his returning to &s;uch practices after &s;uch warn|ings, argues his being wicked over-much; it proves that he is to an awful degree under the power of &s;atan and his own heart's lu&s;ts, and it is a dreadful token of his being given over to ruin and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e ca&s;es in which human laws inflict higher puni&s;h|ments on a &s;econd or third conviction, and e&s;pecially where death is the penalty on a third conviction, a per&s;on has &s;till plainer and more &s;olemn warnings given him. Tho&s;e low|er puni&s;hments are de&s;igned to reform the offender, and they are well &s;uited to an&s;wer this de&s;ign. He ought to look on them as warnings of more &s;evere puni&s;hments to be expec|ted if he refu&s;es to be reformed, and "&s;till goes on in his tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." And he that being thus often reproved, har|deneth his neck, has nothing to expect but that he &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ways in which men render them&s;elves ex|ce&s;&s;ively vicious. When a man commits the gro&s;&s;er kinds of &s;in; when he frequently repeats the &s;ame vice; or when he per&s;i&s;ts and hardens him&s;elf in his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions under &s;olemn warnings; in each of the&s;e ca&s;es a man may be &s;aid to be "over-much wicked." But when all the&s;e circum|&s;tances concur and unite in the &s;ame per&s;on; when his crimes are of the higher kinds greatly injurious to particular per&s;ons, and utterly incon&s;i&s;tant with the &s;afety and happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="010926_0009_0F8C692C97F750A0">
of the community; when &s;uch crimes have been fre|quently committed and long lived in; and when lighter puni&s;hments, in&s;tead of detering and reforming the offender, do but render him more bold and pre&s;umptuous; then is the per&s;on in a very high degree wicked over-much. His character is compleat and fini&s;hed: The mea&s;ure of his &s;ins is filled up, and the man is ripe for de&s;truction.</P>
<P>But I proceed to the &s;econd thing propo&s;ed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>II. That an untimely death is what exce&s;&s;ive wickedne&s;s tends to, and what it may rea&s;onably be expected to i&s;&s;ue in.</P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation may be illu&s;trated and confirmed by the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. Being "over much wicked" tends to &s;horten the life of a man, or to bring death &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e it would have come according to the ordinary cour&s;e of things.</P>
<P>There is "a &s;ea&s;on and a time for every purpo&s;e under the &s;un," and God "has made every thing beautiful in his time:" Among other things "there is a time to die."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. iii. 1, 2, 11.</NOTE> Old age is, according to the cour&s;e of nature, the time to die. When nature is worn out, and can no longer di&s;charge its functions, it is time they &s;hould cea&s;e: When the &s;ea&s;on for either doing or getting good in this world is over, it is time to leave it: When the earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle is gone to decay, and is no longer a proper habitation for the rational &s;oul to re&s;ide in, and exert its noble powers and ca|pacities, it is the proper time for its being di&s;&s;olved, and for the &s;oul's entering upon another and more perfect &s;tate of exi&s;tence, in which its capacities of Action and of Enjoy|ment &s;hall no longer be clogged and prevented from exert|ing them&s;elves as they now are. And there &s;eems to be a propriety and beauty in leaving this world when a man can no longer be either u&s;eful or comfortable in it; e&s;pecially if he be prepared for a more exalted and perfect &s;tate of ex|i&s;tence.
<PB N="11" REF="010926_0010_0F852BEA93C31118">
Hence we have that de&s;cription of the death of a good man in old age, "Thou &s;hall come to thy grave in a full age, like as a &s;hock of corn cometh in his &s;ea&s;on."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job v. 26.</NOTE> Old age being thus the "time to die," according to the cour&s;e of nature, the death of a per&s;on in youth or middle age, is &s;tiled <HI>untimely,</HI> or a man is in &s;uch a ca&s;e &s;aid to die before his time, that is, before the time which nature &s;eems to point out for dying, or before the time, to which, according to the ordinary cour&s;e of things under the government of Divine Providence, his con&s;titution might have held out, and &s;o he might have lived u&s;efully and comfortably.</P>
<P>Now exce&s;&s;ive wickedne&s;s tends to an untimely death in this &s;en&s;e. It has both a natural and a moral tendency to this: And the tendency is &s;o &s;trong that it may rea&s;onably be expected, that this will be the i&s;&s;ue and event.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s of any kind does in its own nature tend to weaken, wear out and de&s;troy the human con&s;titution: It introduces di&s;orders, pains and weakne&s;s, which all tend to the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the body, and frequently bring on death &s;ooner than it would have come in the cour&s;e of nature. This is e&s;peci|ally true of &s;ome particular kinds of wickedne&s;s, and per|haps of none more than Intemperance and exce&s;&s;ive lu&s;t. "Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;ea iv. 11.</NOTE> "They die in youth" who&s;e "life is among the unclean."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxvi. 14.</NOTE> And then all kinds of wickedne&s;s, e&s;pecially when practi&s;ed in an exce&s;&s;ive degree, tend to procure an untimely death as they provoke GOD, the &s;overeign ruler of the world, to cut men off in the mid&s;t of their days. Hence we have &s;uch threat|nings as the&s;e, "Bloody and deceitful men &s;hall not live out half their days,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. lv. 23.</NOTE> and "he that getteth riches and not by right, &s;hall leave them in the mid&s;t of his days, and at his end &s;hall be a fool."<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xvii. 11.</NOTE> The&s;e threatnings a righteous GOD carries into execution in various ways; &s;ometimes by di&s;|ea&s;es,
<PB N="12" REF="010926_0011_0F852BEB651725D0">
and at other times by accidents, all of which are under his direction and accompli&s;h his plea&s;ure. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. Being "over-much wicked" tends to an untimely death as it expo&s;es a man to capital puni&s;hment, or to be cut off by the &s;word of civil ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It is commonly &s;aid of one that has &s;uffered death as a malefactor, that <HI>he came to an untimely end.</HI> And there is a propriety in the expre&s;&s;ion; for &s;uch an one dies &s;ooner than he would have done in the ordinary cour&s;e of things; he dies while his &s;trength is firm in him, before his con&s;tituti|on is exhau&s;ted and death become nece&s;&s;ary according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature: He dies before the &s;ea&s;on which the wi&s;e man calls the "time to die;" and therefore when, humanly &s;peaking, he might have lived longer.</P>
<P>Now if we take the expre&s;&s;ion of a man's dying before his time in this &s;en&s;e, or under&s;tand by it his &s;uffering a vi|olent death from the hand of civil ju&s;tice, it is true that be|ing wicked over-much expo&s;es a man to it.</P>
<P>Civil Magi&s;tracy is an "ordinance of GOD," and a very important and nece&s;&s;ary one. The great end and de&s;ign of it, is the public good; or the &s;ecurity, the peace and hap|pine&s;s of civil &s;ociety. This end cannot be attained unle&s;s magi&s;trates are ve&s;ted with &s;ufficient power to puni&s;h male|factors, and that with &s;uch a degree of &s;everity that others may be re&s;trained from imitating them. Accordingly GOD has committed the &s;word to the magi&s;trate, and con&s;tituted him "the revenger to execute wrath on him that doeth evil."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 4.</NOTE> Some crimes are &s;o great and of &s;o pernicious a na|ture that nothing can expiate them, or &s;ecure the public from the ruinous effects of them, but the death of the crimi|nal: Accordingly GOD has, in mercy to the community, committed the &s;word to the magi&s;trate, and con&s;tituted him
<PB N="13" REF="010926_0012_0F852BEC22AC28E0">
"a revenger to execute wrath" on &s;uch per&s;ons. It has in con&s;equence hereof been allowed in all ages and nations, that the civil magi&s;trate has a ju&s;t right in &s;ome ca&s;es to in|flict capital puni&s;hments, or to take away the life of a male|factor. One of the laws GOD gave to mankind in general was, "who&s;o &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. ix. 6.</NOTE> There can therefore be no doubt that murder is to be puni&s;hed with death: Nor is this the only crime that may ju&s;tly be thus puni&s;hed. When GOD him&s;elf conde&s;|cended to become the King of the Jewi&s;h nation, and in this character gave them a body of judicial laws, he ordered that &s;everal other crimes be&s;ides murder, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death. Now, though the laws given peculiarly to the Jews, do not nece&s;&s;arily oblige other nations to whom they were not given; yet, &s;ince they came from GOD, it mu&s;t be al|lowed that there was nothing unju&s;t either in the laws them|&s;elves, or in the penalties with which they were inforced.</P>
<P>Human laws, con&s;ider crimes in a political view; and the &s;cale by which the evil of them is mea&s;ured and determi|ned, is their tendency to de&s;troy the public good, or the &s;afety and happine&s;s of &s;ociety. If, therefore, there are crimes, the prevalence of which will certainly de&s;troy the &s;afety and &s;e|curity, and even the being of &s;ociety; and at the &s;ame time, men are not to be detered or re&s;trained from practi&s;ing them by any other method, it is lawful for the magi&s;trate to put them to death. The right of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation belongs to communities as well as to particular per&s;ons. This right will ju&s;tify a private man in taking away the life of one that a&s;&s;aults them, when he can no other way defend his own life again&s;t him; and it will as fully vindicate the magi&s;trate in putting to death the criminal, again&s;t who&s;e de&s;tructive prac|tices the public cannot otherwi&s;e be &s;ecured and defended.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010926_0013_0F852BECD7CCFCB0">
It can hardly be doubted, that a long continued cour&s;e of hou&s;e-breaking, and robbery is as de&s;tructive of the being and happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety, as a &s;ingle in&s;tance of murder; and more &s;o than &s;ome crimes that were made capital by the Jewi&s;h law; and if this be granted, the ju&s;tice of puni&s;hing it with death &s;eems evident. By the law of Mo&s;es a man was ju&s;tified who killed the per&s;on he found breaking up his hou&s;e in the night.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxii. 2, 3.</NOTE> It &s;eems therefore that this crime did, in the judgment of the Divine Lawgiver, amount to a forfeiture of life. For as every man has a right to his life, it is murder to kill a man who has not forfeited his life: But in this ca&s;e, the killing was allowed, and therefore the forfeiture mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now, if a cour&s;e of hou&s;e-breaking and robbery be ju&s;tly puni&s;hable with death, it is plain that being in this way over-much wicked is the way for a per&s;on to die before his time.</P>
<P>I will but ju&s;t add,</P>
<P N="3">3. Death is always untimely to the per&s;on who is unpre|pared for it: And in this &s;en&s;e he that is wicked over-much is in the utmo&s;t danger of dying before his time.</P>
<P>Death is untimely whenever it comes before that great and important de&s;ign for which life was given, is an&s;wered: And it had been better not to have lived at all, than in this re&s;pect to have lived in vain. We are &s;ent into this world as probationers for an eternal &s;tate. The great end for which life is given, and on the account of which it is worth having, is that men may obtain a right to, and the nece&s;&s;ary quali|fications for, a &s;tate of complete and everla&s;ting happine&s;s, in that un&s;een world into which they enter at death: That they may obtain the pardon of their &s;ins and acceptance with GOD through the blood of JESUS CHRIST his Son, and be made meet for the inheritance of the &s;aints in light.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="010926_0014_0F852BEDA1A3ADD8">
Being "over-much wicked" directly tends not to prepare men for heaven, but to render them "ve&s;&s;els of wrath fitted for de&s;truction." By frequently repeating &s;inful actions, and per&s;i&s;ting in them under warnings and reproofs, men trea&s;ure up to them&s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and reve|lation of the righteous judgment of GOD. Nor can a man take a more direct way to die before his time, that is, before he is prepared for death, than by being over-much wicked. For re&s;olutely per&s;i&s;ting, and going to great exce&s;s, in tho&s;e things for the &s;ake of which the wrath of GOD comes on the children of di&s;obedience, is by no means the way to obtain the mercy of GOD, through CHRIST to eternal life: But it is the way to harden men in &s;in and impenitence, and to ren|der them the proper objects of the everla&s;ting indignation and wrath of the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY.</P>
<P>But it is time to apply what has been &s;aid to the pre&s;ent &s;o|lemn occa&s;ion. And how can I more properly do this, than by &s;aying, "This day is this &s;cripture fulfilled," before your eyes, and may your "eyes affect your hearts!" You have now before you a man that has been "over-much wicked;" one that has rendered him&s;elf notorious by the practice of great and enormous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, &s;uch acts of inju&s;tice and violence as are de&s;tructive of civil &s;ociety, and utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of the community. His crimes have been frequently repeated and carried to an a&s;to|ni&s;hing exce&s;s: He has per&s;i&s;ted in them under warnings and reproofs, and to an awful degree hardened his heart un|der rebukes and puni&s;hments. The lighter puni&s;hments in|flicted on him, and even the &s;entence of death and pro&s;pect of execution, have been &s;o far from bringing him to true re|pentance, that they have not re&s;trained him from repeating his crime, and that in a number of in&s;tances. He has been a remarkable in&s;tance of impenitence: Seldom does the cor|ruption

of human nature &s;hew it&s;elf in &s;o &s;trong and affecting a light: Few men, it is to be hoped, have &s;o entirely &s;old them&s;elves to do evil. And now you all &s;ee the end of &s;uch a cour&s;e. He now &s;tands before you in the character of a condemned malefactor, and one that is in an hour or two to receive the due reward of his evil deeds, even death from the &s;troke of public ju&s;tice. He has to an awful degree been "over-much wicked," and is now agreeable to the threaten|ing contained in my text, to "die before his time." He is to die while a young man, but twenty-eight years of age, and when according to the ordinary cour&s;e of things he might have lived much longer. He comes to an <HI>untimely end,</HI> as he is to &s;uffer a violent death, in the execution of a legal &s;entence. And I pray GOD his death may not prove untimely in a &s;till wor&s;e &s;en&s;e, by coming upon him while he is unprepared for it.</P>
<P>So melancholy a &s;pectacle &s;ugge&s;ts &s;everal u&s;eful re|flections, and mu&s;t &s;urely engage our minds to fix and dwell upon them.</P>
<P>The whole world would be no con&s;ideration at all to induce any one of us to &s;tand in the place, or be in the condition of the criminal before us; &s;hall we not then carefully avoid, and be continually on our guard again&s;t every thing that tends to bring us into &s;o unhappy a &s;tate? We all have the &s;ame corruptions of &s;oul, the indulgence of which has rendered this man &s;o exce&s;&s;ively wicked, and brought him into the unhappy condition in which we now behold him. He therefore who gratifies any of the &s;inful inclinations of his own heart, takes the direct road to ruin and de&s;truction. Every indulgence of a vicious appetite &s;trengthens it, and renders it the more difficult for him afterward to &s;ubdue or even re&s;train it. Every act of &s;in of any kind &s;trengthens the habit: And every &s;tep a man takes in a cour&s;e of vice,
<PB N="17" REF="010926_0016_0F852BEF15BB3F68">
brings him nearer to that exce&s;s in wickedne&s;s of which we have &s;o deplorable an example now before our eyes. Men grow extremely wicked by degrees. When they fir&s;t en|gage in &s;inful practices they intend to keep within &s;ome bounds, and to be but moderately vicious; and perhaps would tremble at the thought of committing tho&s;e greater crimes which they afterwards run into without remor&s;e or concern. By practi&s;ing &s;maller &s;ins they are emboldened to commit greater iniquities. And this is what may rea&s;on|ably be expected, as it is exactly agreable to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> on of human nature. Every act of &s;in &s;trengthens <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> inclination of the &s;inner, and at the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> weakens the natural re&s;traints from &s;in, &s;uch as the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of con&s;cience, a regard to reputation, fear of &s;hame, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> puni&s;hment. Now it is not to be wondered at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> from one degree of wickedne&s;s to another until they arrive at the greate&s;t exce&s;s, when they are thus continually &s;trength|ening their own vicious inclinations, and at the &s;ame times abating the force of all tho&s;e principles which were implant|ed in them on purpo&s;e to &s;erve as natural pre&s;ervatives and re&s;traints from &s;in. E&s;pecially con&s;idering that by the habi|tual practice of wickedne&s;s, though in a lower degree, men provoke an holy GOD to withhold from them the re&s;traints of his Providence and Grace, and to leave them to be as vile as unbridled corruption can make them, and &s;o to bring them&s;elves to an untimely death in this world, and to an aw|fully aggravated condemnation in the world to come.</P>
<P>This is the ca&s;e particularly with regard to &s;ins of unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s or di&s;hone&s;ty. Men &s;eldom, if ever, begin with the higher degrees of this kind, &s;uch as hou&s;e-breaking, rob|bery and murder; but they fir&s;t practice the arts of cheat|ing and defrauding; from thence they proceed to the lower kinds of pilfering and theft, and are by degrees brought <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|der

the power of &s;atan, and hardened in &s;in till they are pre|pared to commit all iniquity with greedine&s;s. "So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain" until at length "he taketh away the life of the owners thereof."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> And indeed it may generally be expected, that he who will be guilty of hou&s;e-breaking and robbery, will (if re&s;i&s;ted, or like to be ap|prehended) take away the life of a man.</P>
<P>Now, if this be the way in which men become "over-much wicked, &s;o as to die before their time," of how great importance is it that their vicious inclinations in&s;tead of being gratified and &s;trengthened, &s;hould be re&s;i&s;ted and curbed in early life; and that tho&s;e principles in human nature, which &s;erve to re&s;train men from gro&s;s &s;ins, &s;hould be kept alive and &s;trengthened? Much of this kind may be done by a re|gular and virtuous education: And a criminal neglect of family religion, in&s;truction and government is frequently the means of bringing per&s;ons to infamy and damnation. When family religion and in&s;truction are neglected; when no or|der or government is maintained in private hou&s;es; when the reins are thrown loo&s;e on the necks of giddy and thought|le&s;s youths; when children who have not di&s;cretion to go|vern them&s;elves, are not governed by others; and when ma&s;|ters care not where their &s;ervants are, or how they are em|ployed, in the night, &s;o that they do but perform their daily ta&s;k; what can be expected, but that they will go from lower to higher degrees of wickedne&s;s, until they arrive at the mo&s;t infamous and the mo&s;t ruinous exce&s;&s;es? The ca&s;e is &s;till wor&s;e when heads of families by their own vicious examples encourage their children and &s;ervants in tho&s;e evil practices, which all their authority &s;hould be exerted in pre|venting and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing. To &s;uch unnatural parents, to &s;uch cruel ma&s;ters, (if any &s;uch are now pre&s;ent) I mu&s;t &s;ay, look on the criminal now before you, under &s;entence of

death and going to execution, and think &s;eriou&s;ly what ago|nies you would feel were you to &s;ee a child or a &s;ervant of your own, any one whom Providence had committed to your care, in&s;truction and government, in his condition; and to reflect on your&s;elves as having been in&s;trumental in bringing him into it. And here I cannot help wi&s;hing that the mi&s;tre&s;s of this unhappy per&s;on, who he &s;ays not only encouraged, but employed him, when a boy, in &s;tealing things of &s;mall value, were now pre&s;ent to &s;ee what &s;he was criminally in|&s;trumental in bring him to.</P>
<P>A principal de&s;ign of public execution is, that others may fear and do no more &s;o wickedly. Let the in&s;tance before us be improved with this view. Let it engage all who have the education and government of others committed to them, to bring them up in a virtuous, religious manner; to give them proper in&s;truction, and to maintain a due govern|ment over them; to encourage in them every thing that is virtuous and prai&s;e-worthy; to curb the fir&s;t appearances of vice in them; and to re&s;train them from &s;uch practices, and &s;uch company as lead to it. Let all beware of habituating them&s;elves to the lower kinds and degrees of wickedne&s;s, le&s;t they be hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, and lead by in&s;en&s;ible &s;teps to the greate&s;t exce&s;s in wickedne&s;s, even &s;uch as &s;hall bring them into the melancholy condition of the unhappy per&s;on now before us.</P>
<P>It is owing to the re&s;training grace of GOD, that any &s;in|ners are kept from the greate&s;t exce&s;s in wickedne&s;s. But this grace is ordinarily afforded in the&s;e ways; and therefore we ought to be careful and diligent in the u&s;e of &s;uch means. And he that does not by the u&s;e of them endeavour to pre&s;erve him&s;elf, and all committed to his care, cannot rea&s;onably expect that GOD will keep him or them.</P>
<P>After all, it mu&s;t be owned that &s;uch re&s;traints as may be
<PB N="20" REF="010926_0019_0F852BF15D09B358">
expected in the&s;e ways, will not ab&s;olutely &s;ecure &s;inners from the danger of being &s;o exce&s;&s;ively wicked as to die before their time. There is no &s;afety in a &s;tate of impenitence and un|belief. In order to a per&s;on's being in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, it is not &s;ufficient that his corruptions be under &s;ome pre&s;ent re&s;traints, but they mu&s;t be really &s;ubdued and even morti|fied by the &s;anctifying operations of the Spirit of CHRIST. Nor indeed is habitual grace a complete &s;ecurity in this ca&s;e; for though "he that is born of GOD doth not commit &s;in"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 9.</NOTE> &s;o as to live in the practice of it, yet it is not impo&s;&s;ible but he may in a &s;ingle in&s;tance commit a capital crime. The lively and continual exerci&s;e of grace is the only way to be &s;afe and &s;ecure. Let &s;inners then be awakened to flee for refuge to the hope &s;et before them in the go&s;pel. Let the terrors of hu|man, as well as tho&s;e of the Divine Law, excite and quicken them hereto. Let none re&s;t &s;atisfied or think them&s;elves &s;e|cure till they experience the regenerating and &s;anctifying in|fluences of the Holy Spirit, changing them into the love and the image of GOD. And let not believers content them&s;elves with grace already received, but let them be careful to live in the exerci&s;e of it, and to grow and increa&s;e in it. Let it be their care to maintain a con&s;tant and lively &s;en&s;e of the glorious perfections and the continual pre&s;ence of GOD. And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> them, in the &s;teady practice of the duties of piety and de|votion, maintain communion with GOD in CHRIST.

It is of the la&s;t importance that you be thoroughly convinced of all your &s;ins of heart and life; and particularly of the crime for which you are to &s;uf|fer; that you be deeply humbled for the extreme evil and the amazing folly you have been guilty of; and that, under a &s;en&s;e of your being a guilty and ju&s;tly condemned creature, you make your flight to the hope &s;et before peri&s;hing &s;in|ners in the go&s;pel, even to the infinitely rich, and infinitely free grace of GOD exerci&s;ed through JESUS CHRIST, the all-&s;ufficient Mediator of the new Covenant. And it is of infi|nite importance that you do this immediately, &s;ince you are now within an hour or two of the eternal world.</P>
<P>Your &s;ins go before you to judgment. They have been too open and notorious to be denied, and too great and ag|gravated to admit of any &s;ort of excu&s;e. Be&s;ides &s;maller crimes, of which your own con&s;cience mu&s;t doubtle&s;s accu&s;e you, and which were the &s;teps by which you proceeded to greater, you have in &s;ome very high in&s;tances tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the eternal law of ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, in violently tak|ing away the property of other per&s;ons. You have in a &s;ur|pri&s;ing number of in&s;tances, broken into their hou&s;es, and robbed them of their &s;ub&s;tance, and in one in&s;tance &s;et their dwelling on fire, wa&s;ted their goods, and endangered their lives. Your crimes of hou&s;e-breaking and robbery have been frequently repeated: You have per&s;i&s;ted in them after hav|ing been convicted and puni&s;hed a fir&s;t and &s;econd time; and that when you well knew, and was &s;olemnly warned of it, that death was the penalty on a third conviction. Nay you have &s;hewn your&s;elf wicked and hardened to a degree we &s;hould &s;carcely have thought human nature capable of, were we not convinced by the fact; for even after &s;entence of death had pa&s;&s;ed upon you for this crime, no &s;ooner did you obtain liberty by breaking pri&s;on, than you immediately re|turned to the practice of the &s;ame wickedne&s;s. Thus have
<PB N="22" REF="010926_0021_0F852BF65742FC90">
you, though often reproved, hardened your neck, and now you &s;ee the con&s;equence, you are &s;uddenly to be de&s;troyed and that without remedy. The peace and well-fare of the public, and the &s;afety and &s;ecurity of particular per&s;ons render it nece&s;&s;ary that your forfeited life &s;hould be taken away. Ju&s;tice requires that you &s;hould &s;uffer; and it is nece&s;&s;ary that you be made a public example to deter others from committing &s;uch wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>And, if your crimes de&s;erve &s;o awful a puni&s;hment from man, what do they de&s;erve from GOD? The bo|dily death you are now to &s;uffer, is nothing when com|pared with the death of the &s;oul, that eternal death which means an endle&s;s exi&s;tence in a &s;tate of exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery; and which your &s;ins ju&s;tly de&s;erve. You have in an high-handed manner, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws and trampled on the authority of GOD, the &s;overeign ruler of the world: You have greatly offended and provok|ed HIM who is able to de&s;troy both &s;oul and body for|ever. The ju&s;t penalty of the Divine Law, which you have broken, is that death which con&s;i&s;ts in being ca&s;t into the "lake of fire." And if death from the hand of man be &s;o terrible, what mu&s;t that be which comes immediately from the hand of the Lord GOD Almigh|ty? If you can &s;carce &s;upport your&s;elf under the near pro&s;pect of your approaching execution, how can your heart endure or your hands be &s;trong when GOD &s;hall enter into judgment with you?
