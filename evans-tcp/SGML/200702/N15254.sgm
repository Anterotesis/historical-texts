<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of this Third Part of the Gram|matical In&s;titute of the Engli&s;h Language, is to furni&s;h common Engli&s;h Schools with a va|riety of exerci&s;es for reading and &s;peaking, at a &s;mall expence. Colleges and Academies are al|ready &s;upplied with many excellent collections for this purpo&s;e; among which, the <HI>Art of Speaking, Enfield's Speaker, Enfield's Exerci&s;es, the Precep|tor, the Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,</HI> are u&s;ed with great reputation. But the&s;e are too large and expen&s;ive for the body of the people to purcha&s;e, who cannot afford a &s;chool for their children but a few months in a year. The want of &s;ome &s;mall books of this kind, has confined mo&s;t of our &s;chools to the u&s;e of the Bible, the &s;ize of which and the &s;mallne&s;s of the type, has occa|&s;ioned di&s;tinct portions of it, particularly the P&s;alms and the New Te&s;tament, to be printed &s;eparately on a larger type. But to the common and &s;ole u&s;e of the Bible or any part of it in &s;chools, there are two capital objections.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the &s;tyle is &s;o uniform and &s;o different from that of the pre&s;ent age, that chil|dren, who are confined to it, never acquire a com|plete knowledge of words, and of the modern manne, of writing, to read other books with tol|erable propriety.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, it has often been ob&s;erved by men of piety, that &s;uch a common u&s;e of the Bible, is a kind of pro&s;titution of divine truth to &s;ecular purpo&s;es&mdash;that children are in&s;en&s;ibly led, by a habit of familiarity, to con&s;ider that &s;acred work, or at le&s;t to treat it as a book of no more
<PB N="4" REF="019364_0003_0FAB4B1E97B82C90">
importance than any human per&s;ormance; and that, being accu&s;tomed in early life to repeat it often, and many times with the utmo&s;t reluctance, they imbibe a di&s;gu&s;t for it, which their &s;ub&s;equent conviction of its importance, is &s;eldom able to conquer. If therefore the Bible were read two or three times in a week, with that &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s it de&s;erves, and its precepts explained by the in&s;truc|tor, merely with a view to impre&s;s, upon young minds, moral and religious truths, there is no doubt but &s;uch a u&s;e would have a more perma|nent effect upon the principles and conduct of po&s;terity, and the awful &s;olemnities of in&s;piration would e&s;cape profanation, from the levity and wickedne&s;s of &s;chool-boys.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ubit it the&s;e ideas to the feelings of every per&s;on. For my part I freely own that I have often &s;huddered at the &s;ight of thoughtle&s;s boys, laughing while they mention the name of Jehovah, and repeating the in|vitations of divine mercy and the denunciations of infinite wrath, with the &s;ame indifference as they would rehear&s;e an unimportant paragraph of a news paper.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the following work, I have endeavoured to make &s;uch a collection of e&s;&s;ays as &s;hould form the morals as well as improve the knowledge of youth.</P>
<P>Of the pieces here &s;elected, &s;ome are borrow|ed from Briti&s;h writers of eminence&mdash;&s;ome are fugitive American publications&mdash;&s;ome are taken from the manu&s;cripts of my friends&mdash;and a few are my own compo&s;ition. Whenever I have been indebted to Engli&s;h books I have invariably given credit to the author or compiler.</P>
<P>It is found by experience that Dialogues, as bearing a near re&s;emblance to the common talk
<PB N="5" REF="019364_0004_0FAB4B1F59326C98">
of children, are the be&s;t calculated to prevent or break ill habits of reading, and to teach them an ea&s;y unaffected pronunciation. This will ac|count for the number admitted into this collec|tion.</P>
<P>In the choice of pieces, I have not been inat|tentive to the political intere&s;ts of America. Se|veral of tho&s;e ma&s;terly addre&s;&s;es of Congre&s;s, written at the commencement of the late revolu|tion, contain &s;uch noble, ju&s;t and independent &s;entiments of liberty and patrioti&s;m, that I can|not help wi&s;hing to transfu&s;e them into the brea&s;ts of the ri&s;ing generation.</P>
<P>This part completes the &s;y&s;tem I had propo&s;ed to publi&s;h for the u&s;e of &s;chools. To refine and e&s;tabli&s;h our language, to facilitate the acqui&s;i|tion of grammatical knowledge, and diffu&s;e the principles of virtue and patrioti&s;m, is the ta&s;k I have laboured to perform; and whether the &s;ucce&s;s &s;hould equal my wi&s;hes or not, I &s;hall &s;till have the &s;atisfaction of reflecting that I have made a laudable effort to advance the happine&s;s of my country.</P>

<HEAD>RULES FOR READING AND SPEAKING.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE I. Let your articulation be clear and di&s;tinct.</HEAD>
<P>A GOOD articulation con&s;i&s;ts in giving every letter and &s;yllable, its proper proportion of &s;ound.</P>
<P>Let each &s;yllable and the letters which com|po&s;e it, be pronounced with a clear voice, without whining, drawling, li&s;ping, &s;tammering, mum|bling in the throat or &s;peaking through the no&s;e. Avoid equally a dull, drawling habit and too much rapidity of pronunciation; for each of the&s;e faults de&s;troys a di&s;tinct articulation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE II. Ob&s;erve the &s;tops and make the proper pau&s;es, but make no pau&s;e where the &s;en&s;e requires none.</HEAD>
<P>The characters we u&s;e as &s;tops are extremely ar|bitrary and do not-always mark a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the voice. On the contrary, they are often employed to &s;eparate the &s;everal members of a period, and &s;how the grammatical con&s;truction. Nor when they are de&s;igned to mark pau&s;es, do they always determine the length of tho&s;e pau&s;es; for this depends much on the &s;en&s;e and the nature of the &s;ubject. A &s;emicolon, for example, requires a longer pau&s;e in a grave di&s;cour&s;e, than in a lively and &s;pirited declamation. However, as children
<PB N="8" REF="019364_0006_0FAB4B2ED587F680">
are incapable of nice di&s;tinctions, it may be be&s;t to adopt at fir&s;t &s;ome general rule with re&s;pect to the pau&s;es,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, where the propertion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, colon and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, is fixed at one, two, four, &s;ix.</NOTE> and teach them to pay the &s;ame at|tention to the&s;e characters as they do to the words. They &s;hould be cautioned likewi&s;e again&s;t pau&s;|ing in the mid&s;t of a member of a &s;entence, where the &s;en&s;e requires the words to be clo&s;ely con|nected in pronunciation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE III. Pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention to accent, empha&s;is and cadence.</HEAD>
<P>Let the accented &s;yllables be pronounced with a proper &s;tre&s;s of voice; the unaccented, with lit|tle &s;tre&s;s of voice, but di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>The important words of a &s;entence, which I call naturally emphatical, have a claim to a con|&s;iderable force of voice; but particles, &s;uch as, <HI>of, to, as, and,</HI> &amp;c. require no force of utterance, unle&s;s they happen to be emphatical, which is rarely the ca&s;e. No per&s;on can read or &s;peak well, unle&s;s he under&s;tands what he reads; and the &s;en&s;e will always determine what words are emphatical. It is a matter of the highe&s;t con|&s;equence therefore, that a &s;peaker &s;hould clearly comprehend the meaning of what he delivers, that he may know where to lay the empha&s;is. This may be illu&s;trated by a &s;ingle example. This &s;hort que&s;tion, <HI>Will you ride to town to day?</HI> is capable of four different meanings, and con&s;e|quently
<PB N="9" REF="019364_0007_0FAB4B305FFD06A0">
quently of four different an&s;wers, according to the placing of the empha&s;is. If the empha&s;is is laid upon <HI>you,</HI> the que&s;tion is, whether <HI>you</HI> will ride to town or <HI>another per&s;on.</HI> If the empha&s;is is laid on <HI>ride,</HI> the que&s;tion is, whether you will <HI>ride</HI> or go on <HI>foot.</HI> If the empha&s;is is laid on <HI>town,</HI> the que&s;tion is, whether you will ride to <HI>town</HI> or to <HI>another place.</HI> If the empha&s;is is laid on <HI>to day,</HI> the que&s;tion is, whether you will ride <HI>to day</HI> or &s;ome <HI>other day.</HI> Thus the whole mean|ing of a phra&s;e often depends on the empha&s;is; and it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be laid on the proper words.</P>
<P>Cadence is a falling of the voice in pronoun|cing the clo&s;ing &s;yllable of a period<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">We may ob&s;erve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> good &s;peakers always pronounce upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">; for altho' they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the voice according to the various ideas they expre&s;s, yet the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame pitch of voice. Accent and empha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s require'no elevation of voice, but a more forcible expre&s;&s;ion on the &s;ame key. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> la&s;t &s;yllable only of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; which &s;yllable i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a actually pronounced with a lower tone of voice; but when words of &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s clo&s;e a period, all the &s;yllables but the la&s;t, are pronounced on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ame key as the re&s;t of the &s;entence.</NOTE>. This ought not to be uniform; but different at the clo&s;e of different &s;entences.</P>
<P>But in interrogative &s;entences, the &s;en&s;e often requires the clo&s;ing word or &s;yllable to be pro|nounced with an elevated voice. This, however, is only when the la&s;t word is emphatical; as in this que&s;tion, "Betrave&s;t thou the &s;on of man with a ki&s;s?" Here the &s;ubject of enquiry is, whe|ther the common token of love and benevolence is pro&s;tituted to the purpo&s;e of treachery; the force of the que&s;tion depends on the la&s;t word, which is therefore to be pronounced with an ele|vation
<PB N="10" REF="019364_0008_0FAB4B309D7BCE48">
of voice. But in this que&s;tion, "Where is <HI>boa&s;ting</HI> then?" the emphatical word is <HI>boa&s;ting,</HI> which of cour&s;e requires an elevation of voice.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t natural pitch of voice is that in which we &s;peak in ordinary conver&s;ation. Whenever the voice is rai&s;ed above this key, pronunciation is difficult and fatiguing. There is a difference between a <HI>loud</HI> and a <HI>high</HI> voice. A per&s;on may &s;peak much <HI>louder</HI> than he does in ordinary di&s;|cour&s;e, without any elevation of voice; and he may be heard di&s;tinctly, upon the &s;ame key, ei|ther in a private room or in a large A&s;&s;embly.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="rule">
<HEAD>RULE IV. Let the &s;entiments you expre&s;s be accompanied with proper tones, looks and ge&s;tures.</HEAD>
<P>By <HI>tones</HI> I mean the various modulations of voice by which we naturally expre&s;s the emotions and pa&s;&s;ions. By <HI>looks</HI> I mean the expre&s;&s;ion of the emotions and pa&s;&s;ions in the countenance.</P>
<P><HI>Ge&s;tures</HI> are the various motions of the hands or body which corre&s;pond to the &s;everal &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions which the &s;peaker de&s;igns to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;hould be perfectly natural. They &s;hould be the &s;ame which we u&s;e in common con|ver&s;ation. A &s;peaker &s;hould endeavour to feel what he &s;peaks; for the perfection of reading and &s;peaking is, to pronounce the words as if the &s;en|timents were our own.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on is rehear&s;ing the words of an angry man, he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame furious look, his eyes &s;hould &s;lash with rage, his ge&s;tures &s;hould
<PB N="11" REF="019364_0009_0FAB4B3159733A70">
be violent, and his utterance rapid and vehe|ment. But if he utters the &s;entiments of bene|volence and kindne&s;s, his countenance &s;hould put on a &s;mile, his eye-lids &s;hould be drawn nearer to|gether than u&s;ual, and his voice &s;hould be &s;oft and inviting: An example of the fir&s;t we have in the&s;e words, "Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his Angels." An example of the latter, in the fol|lowing,&mdash;"Come, Ye ble&s;&s;ed of my father, in|herit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world." And the per&s;on, who pronounces the&s;e two &s;entences with the &s;ame voice, looks and ge&s;tures, mu&s;t be a total &s;tranger to the rules of reading and oratory.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe with words all the various pa&s;&s;ions that affect us; they can be learn|ed only from ob&s;erving per&s;ons under the opera|tions of them.</P>
<P>All good &s;peaking mu&s;t ari&s;e from feeling; and when we would utter with propriety the words of another per&s;on, we &s;hould endeavour as much as po&s;&s;ible to put our&s;elves in his place and make his &s;entiments our own. If a reader or &s;peaker is not intere&s;ted in what he &s;ays, his pro|nunciation will <HI>certainly</HI> be without animation, <HI>probably</HI> without propriety.</P>
<P>Let this fundamental rule, therefore, be im|pre&s;&s;ed upon the learner's mind; <HI>That whatever he reads or &s;peaks &s;hould be pronounced ju&s;t as tho' the &s;entiments were his own.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>TO be very active in laudable pur&s;uits, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of a man of merit.</P>
<P>There is an heroic innocence, as well as an he|roic courage.</P>
<P>There is a mean in all things. Even virtue it&s;elf has its &s;tated limits; which not being &s;trictly ob&s;erved, it cea&s;es to be virtue.</P>
<P>It is wi&s;er to prevent a quarrel beforehand, than to revenge it afterwards.</P>
<P>It is much better to reprove, than to be angry &s;ecretly.</P>
<P>No revenge is more heroic, than that which torments envy, by doing good.</P>
<P>The di&s;cretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to pa&s;s over a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Money, like manure, does no good till it is &s;pread. There is no real u&s;e of riches, except in the di&s;tribution; the re&s;t is all conceit.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="019364_0011_0FAB4B32D6CC5978">
A wi&s;e man will de&s;ire no more than what he may get ju&s;tly, u&s;e &s;oberly, di&s;tribute cheerfully, and live upon contentedly.</P>
<P>A contented mind, and a good con&s;cience, will make a man happy in all conditions. He knows not how to fear, who dares to die.</P>
<P>There is but one way of fortifying the &s;oul a|gain&s;t all gloomy pre&s;ages and terrors of mind; and that is, by &s;ecuring to our&s;elves the friend|&s;hip and protection of that Being who di&s;po&s;es of events, and governs futurity.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy is then only valuable, when it &s;erves for the law of life, and not for the o&s;ten|tation of &s;cience.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>WITHOUT a friend the world is but a wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>A man may have a thou&s;and intimate acquain|tances, and not a friend among them all. If you have one friend, think your&s;elf happy.</P>
<P>When once you profe&s;s your&s;elf a friend, en|deavour to be always &s;uch. He can never have any true friends, that will be often changing them.</P>
<P>Pro&s;perity gains friends, and adver&s;ity tries them.</P>
<P>Nothing more engages the affections of men, than a hand&s;ome addre&s;s, and graceful conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>Complai&s;ance renders a &s;uperior amiable, an equal agreeable, and an inferior acceptable.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s of ceremony &s;hews want of breeding.
<PB N="14" REF="019364_0012_0FAB4B33A881DF80">
That civility is be&s;t, which excludes all &s;uper|fluous formality.</P>
<P>Ingratitude is a crime &s;o &s;hameful, that the man was never yet found, who would acknow|ledge him&s;elf guilty of it.</P>
<P>Truth is born with us; and we mu&s;t do vio|lence to nature, to &s;hake off our veracity.</P>
<P>There cannot be a greater treachery, than fir&s;t to rai&s;e a confidence, and then deceive it.</P>
<P>By others' faults, wi&s;e men correct their own.</P>
<P>No man hath a thorough ta&s;te of pro&s;perity, to whom adver&s;ity never happened.</P>
<P>When our vices leave us, we flatter our&s;elves that we leave them.</P>
<P>It is as great a point of wi&s;dom to hide igno|rance, as to di&s;cover knowledge.</P>

<P>CUSTOM is the plague of wi&s;e men, and the idol of fools.</P>
<P>As to be perfectly ju&s;t, is an attribute of the divine nature; to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o to the utmo&s;t of our abil|ities, is the glory of man.</P>
<P>No man was ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> down with the injuries of fortune, unle&s;s he had before &s;uffered him&s;elf to be deceived by her favours.</P>

tho&s;e that are mo&s;t forward in doing them.</P>
<P>By taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy; but in pa&s;&s;ing it over, he is &s;uperior.</P>
<P>To err is human; to forgive, divine.</P>
<P>A more glorious victory cannot be gained o|ver another man, than this, that when the injury began on his part, the kindne&s;s &s;hould begin on ours.</P>
<P>The prodigal robs his heir, the mi&s;er robs him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We &s;hould take a prudent care for the future, but &s;o as to enjoy the pre&s;ent. It is no part of wi&s;dom, to be mi&s;erable to-day, becau&s;e we may happen to be &s;o to-morrow.</P>
<P>To mourn without mea&s;ure is folly; not to mourn at all, in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Some would be thought to do great things, who are but tools and in&s;truments; like the fool who fancied he played upon the organ, when he only drew the bellows.</P>
<P>Though a man may become learned by ano|ther's learning, he never can be wi&s;e but by his own wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>He who wants good &s;en&s;e is unhappy in ha|ving learning; for he has thereby more ways of expo&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is ungenerous to give a man occa&s;ion to blu&s;h at his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in one thing, who perhaps may excel us in many&punc;</P>
<P>No object is more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ing to the eye, than the &s;ight of a man whom you have obliged; nor any mu&s;ic &s;o agreeable to the ear, as the voice of one that owns you for his benefactor.</P>

<P>A good word is an ea&s;y obligation; but not to &s;peak ill requires only our &s;ilence, which co&s;ts us nothing.</P>
<P>It is to affectation the world owes its whole race of coxcombs. Nature in her whole drama never drew &s;uch a part; &s;he has &s;ometimes made a fool, but a coxcomb is always of his own mak|ing.</P>
<P>It is the infirmity of little minds to be taken with every appearance, and dazzled with every thing that &s;parkles; but great minds have but
<PB N="17" REF="019364_0015_0FAB4B4F4A16B3E0">
little admiration, becau&s;e few things appear new to them.</P>
<P>It happens to men of learning, as to ears of corn; they &s;hoot up, and rai&s;e their heads high, while they are empty; but when full, and &s;well|ed with grain, they begin to flag and droop.</P>
<P>He that is truly polite, knows how to contra|dict with re&s;pect, and to plea&s;e without adulation; and is equally remote from an in&s;ipid complai|&s;ance, and a low <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">amiliarity.</P>
<P>The failings of good men are commonly more publi&s;hed in the world than their good deeds; and one fault of a de&s;erving man, &s;hall meet with more reproaches, than all his virtues, prai&s;e: &s;uch is the force of ill will, and ill nature.</P>
<P>It is harder to avoid cen&s;ure, than to gain ap|plau&s;e; for this may be done by one great or wi&s;e action in an age; but to e&s;cape cen&s;ure, a man mu&s;t pa&s;s his whole life without &s;aying or doing one ill or fooli&s;h thing.</P>
<P>When Darius offered Alexander ten thou|&s;and talents to divide Asia equally with him, he an&s;wered, the earth cannot bear two &s;uns, nor Asia, two kings. Parmenio, a friend of Alexan|der's, hearing the great offers Darius had made, &s;aid, were I Alexander, I would accept them. So would I, replied Alexander, were I Parmenio.</P>
<P>Nobility is to be con&s;idered only as an imagi|nary di&s;tinction, unle&s;s accompanied with the practice of tho&s;e generous virtues by which it ought to be obtained. Titles of honour confer|red upon &s;uch as have no per&s;onal me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, are at be&s;t but the royal &s;tamp &s;et upon ba&s;e metal.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="019364_0016_0FAB4B4F574DD200">
Though an honourable title may be conveyed to po&s;terity, yet the ennobling qualities which are the &s;oul of greatne&s;s are a &s;ort of incommunica|ble perfections, and cannot be transferred. If a man could bequeath his virtues by will, and fet|tle his &s;en&s;e and learning upon his heirs, as cer|tainly as he can his lands, a noble de&s;cent would then indeed be a valuable privilege.</P>
<P>Truth is always con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and needs nothing to help it out. It is always near at hand, and &s;its upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware: whereas a lie is trouble&s;ome, and &s;ets a man's invention upon the rack; and one trick needs a great many more to make it good.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure which affects the human mind with the mo&s;t lively and tran&s;porting touches, is the &s;en&s;e that we act in the eye of infinite wi&s;|dom, power, and goodne&s;s, that will crown our virtuous endeavours here with happine&s;s hereaf|ter, large as our de&s;ires, and la&s;ting as our im|mortal &s;ouls; without this, the highe&s;t &s;tate of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e is in&s;ipid, and with it, the lowe&s;t is a paradi&s;e.</P>

<P>HONOURABLE age is not that which &s;tandeth in length of time, nor which is mea|&s;ured by number of years; but wi&s;dom is the grey hair unto man, and un&s;potted life is old age.</P>
<P>Wickedne&s;s, condemned by her own witne&s;s, is very timorous, and being pre&s;&s;ed with con&s;ci|ence, always foreca&s;teth evil things: for fear is

nothing el&s;e, but a betraying of the &s;uccours which rea&s;on offereth.</P>
<P>A wi&s;e man will fear in every thing. He that contemneth &s;mall things &s;hall fall by little and little.</P>
<P>A rich man beginning to fall is held up of his friends; but a poor man being down is thru&s;t away by his friends; when a rich man is fallen he hath many helpers; he &s;peaketh things not to be &s;poken, and yet men ju&s;tify him; the poor man &s;lipt and they rebuked him; he &s;poke wi&s;e|ly, and could have no place. When a rich man &s;peaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and look, what he &s;aith they extol it to the clouds; but if a poor man &s;peak, they &s;ay, what fellow is this?</P>
<P>Many have fallen by the edge of the &s;word, but not &s;o many as have fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from it, and hath not pa&s;&s;ed through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor been bound in her bonds; for the yoke thereof is a yoke of ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, and the bands thereof are bands of bra&s;s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e death thereof is an evil death.</P>
<P>My &s;on, blemi&s;h not thy good deeds, neither u&s;e uncomfortable words, when thou give&s;t any thing. Shall not the dew a&s;&s;uage the heat? &s;o is a word better than a gift. Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a gracious man.</P>
<P>Blame not, before thou ha&s;t examined the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> under&s;tand fir&s;t, and then rebuke.</P>
<P>If thou woulde&s;t get a friend, prove him fir&s;t

and be not ha&s;ty to credit him; for &s;ome men are friends for their own occa&s;ions, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble.</P>
<P>For&s;ake not an old friend, for the new is not compareable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old thou &s;halt drink it with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A friend cannot be known in pro&s;perity; and an enemy cannot be hidden in adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>Admoni&s;h thy friend; it may be he hath not done it; and if he hath, that he do it no more. Admoni&s;h thy friend; it may be he hath not &s;aid it, or if he hath, that he &s;peak it not again. Ad|moni&s;h a friend; for many times it is a &s;lander; and believe not every tale. There is one that &s;lippeth in his &s;peech, but not from his heart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue?</P>
<P>Who&s;o di&s;covereth &s;ecrets lo&s;eth his credit, and &s;hall never find a friend to his mind.</P>
<P>Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the &s;orrows of thy mother: how can&s;t thou recompen&s;e them the things they have done for thee?</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;o much worth as a mind well in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>The lips of talkers will be telling &s;uch things as pertain not unto them; but the words of &s;uch as have under&s;tanding are weighed in the balance. The art of fools is in their mouth, but the tongue of the wi&s;e is in their heart.</P>

<P>THE latter part of a wi&s;e man's life is taken up in curing the follies, prejudices, and fal&s;e opinions he had contracted in the former.</P>
<P>Cen&s;ure is the tax a man pays to the public for being eminent.</P>
<P>Very few men, properly &s;peaking, live at pre|&s;ent, but are providing to live another time.</P>
<P>Party is the madne&s;s of many, for the gain of a few.</P>
<P>To endeavour to work upon the vulgar with fine &s;en&s;e, is like attempting to hew blocks of marble with a razor.</P>
<P>Super&s;tition is the &s;pleen of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>He who tells a lie is not &s;en&s;ible how great a ta&s;k he undertakes; for he mu&s;t be forced to in|vent twenty more to maintain that one.</P>
<P>Some people will never learn any thing, for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;on, becau&s;e they under&s;tand every thing too &s;oon.</P>
<P>There is nothing wanted to make all rational and di&s;intere&s;ted people in the world of one reli|gion, but that they &s;hould talk together every day.</P>
<P>Men are grateful, in the &s;ame degree that they are re&s;entful.</P>
<P>Young men are &s;ubtle arguers; the cloak of
<PB N="22" REF="019364_0020_0FAB4B532494CEA0">
honour covers all their faults, as that of pa&s;&s;ion all their follies.</P>
<P>Economy is no di&s;grace; it is better living on a little, than out-living a great deal.</P>
<P>Next to the &s;atisfaction I receive in the pro&s;|perity of an hone&s;t man, I am be&s;t plea&s;ed with the confu&s;ion of a ra&s;cal.</P>
<P>What is often termed &s;hyne&s;s, is nothing more than refined &s;en&s;e, and an indifference to common ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on in&s;en&s;ibly fixes upon &s;ome degree of refinement in his di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ome mea&s;ure of thought which he thinks worth exhibiting. It is wi&s;e to fix this pretty high, although it occa|&s;ions one to talk the le&s;s.</P>
<P>To endeavour all one's days to fortify our minds with learning and philo&s;ophy, is to &s;pend &s;o much in armour, that one has nothing left to defend.</P>
<P>Deference often &s;hrinks and withers as much upon the approach of intimacy, as the &s;en&s;itive plant does upon the touch of one's finger.</P>
<P>Men are &s;ometimes accu&s;ed of pride, merely becau&s;e their accu&s;ers would be proud them&s;eves if they were in their places.</P>
<P>People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> quently u&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion, I am in|cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to think &s;o and &s;o, not con&s;idering that they are &s;peaking the mo&s;t literal of all truths.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty makes large amends for the pain it gives the per&s;ons who labour under it, by the prejudice it affords every worthy per&s;on in their favour&punc;</P>
<P>The difference there is betwixt honour and
<PB N="23" REF="019364_0021_0FAB4B53E15F0F70">
hone&s;ty &s;eems to be chiefly in the motive. The hone&s;t man does that from duty, which the man of honour does for the &s;ake of character.</P>
<P>A liar begins with making falshood appear like truth, and ends with making truth it&s;elf appear like falshood.</P>
<P>Virtue &s;hould be con&s;idered as a part of ta&s;te; and we &s;hould as much avoid deceit, or &s;ini&s;ter meanings in di&s;cour&s;e, as we would puns, bad language, or fal&s;e grammar.</P>
<P>The higher character a per&s;on &s;upports, the more he &s;hould regard his minute&s;t actions.</P>

<P>DEFERENCE is the mo&s;t complicate, the mo&s;t indirect, and the mo&s;t elegant of all compliments.</P>
<P>He that lies in bed all a &s;ummer's morning, lo&s;es the plea&s;ure of the day: he that gives up his youth to indolence, undergoes a lo&s;s of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>Shining characters are not always the mo&s;t a|greeable ones. The mild radiance of an eme|rald, is by no means le&s;s plea&s;ing than the glare of the ruby.</P>
<P>To be at once a rake, and to glory in the char|acter, di&s;covers at the &s;ame time a bad di&s;po&s;iti|on, and a bad ta&s;te.</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible to expect that mankind will take advice, when they will not &s;o much as take warning.</P>
<P>Although men are accu&s;ed for not knowing
<PB N="24" REF="019364_0022_0FAB4B54D33B1880">
their own weakne&s;s, yet perhaps as few know their own &s;trength. It is in men as in &s;oils, where &s;ometimes there is a vein of gold which the own|er knows not of.</P>
<P>Fine &s;en&s;e and exalted &s;en&s;e are not half &s;o va|luable as common &s;en&s;e. There are forty men of wit for one man of &s;en&s;e; and he that will car|ry nothing about him but gold, will be every day at a lo&s;s for want of ready change.</P>
<P>Learning is like mercury, one of the mo&s;t powerful and excellent things in the world in &s;kilful hands; in un&s;kilful, mo&s;t mi&s;chievous.</P>
<P>A man &s;hould never be a&s;hamed to own he has been in the wrong; which is but &s;aying, in other words, that he is wi&s;er to-day than he was ye&s;terday,</P>
<P>Wherever I find a great deal of gratitude in a poor man, I take it &s;or granted there would be as much genero&s;ity if he were a rich man.</P>
<P>Flowers of rhetoric in &s;ermons or &s;erious di&s;|cour&s;es, are like the blue and red flowers in corn, plea&s;ing to tho&s;e who come only for amu&s;ement, but prejudicial to him who would reap the profit.</P>
<P>It often happens that tho&s;e are the be&s;t people, who&s;e characters have been mo&s;t injured by &s;landerers; as we u&s;ually find that to be the &s;weete&s;t fruit, which the birds have been pecking at.</P>
<P>The eye of a critic is often like a micro&s;cope, made &s;o very fine and nice, that it di&s;covers the atoms, grains, and minute&s;t articles, without ever comprehending the whole, comparing the parts, or &s;eeing all at once the harmony.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="019364_0023_0FAB4B56AA2DB2F0">
Men's zeal for religion is much of the &s;ame kind as that which they &s;hew for a foot-ball: whenever it is conte&s;ted for, every one is ready to venture their lives and limbs in the di&s;pute; but when that is once at an end, it is no more thought on, but &s;leeps in oblivion, buried in rubbi&s;h, which no one thinks it worth his pains to rake in|to, much le&s;s to remove.</P>
<P>Honour is but a fictious kind of hone&s;ty; a mean, but a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;titute for it, in &s;ocie|ties which have none: it is a &s;ort of paper-credit, with which men are obliged to trade, who are de|ficient in the &s;terling ca&s;h of true morality and religion.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of great delicacy &s;hould know the cer|tainty of the following truth: there are abun|dance of ca&s;es which occa&s;ion &s;u&s;pen&s;e, in which whatever they determine they will repent of their determination; and this through a propen&s;ity of human nature to fancy happine&s;s in tho&s;e &s;chemes which it does not pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The chief advantage that ancient writers can boa&s;t over modern ones &s;eems owing to &s;impli|city. Every noble truth and &s;entiment was ex|pre&s;&s;ed by the former in a natural manner, in word and phra&s;e &s;imple, per&s;picuous, and inca|pable of improvement.

<P>Pride is undoubtedly the origin of anger; but pride, like every other pa&s;&s;ion, if it breaks loo&s;e from rea&s;on, counteracts its own purpo&s;es.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. AGATHOCLES and CALISTA.</HEAD>
<P>CALISTA was young and beautiful, endowed with a great &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of wit and &s;olid &s;en&s;e. A|gathocles, who&s;e age very little exceeded her's, was well made, brave and prudent. He had the good fortune to be introduced to Cali&s;ta's: where his looks, wandering indifferently over a numer|ous circle, &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed and fixed upon her.</P>
<P>But recovering from the &s;hort extacy occa&s;ion|ed by the fir&s;t &s;ight, he immediately reproached him&s;elf, as being guilty of rudene&s;s to the re&s;t of the company; a fault which he had endeavoured to correct, by looking round on other objects. Vain attempts! they were attracted by a power|ful charm, and turned again towards Cali&s;ta. He blu&s;hed as well as &s;he, while a &s;weet emotion, till then un&s;elt, produced a kind of fluttering in his heart, and confu&s;ion in his countenance.</P>
<P>They both became at the &s;ame time, more ti|mid, and more curious. He was plea&s;ed with gaz|ing at Cali&s;ta; which he could not do without trembling: whil&s;t Cali&s;ta, &s;ecretly &s;ati&s;fied with this flattering preference, ca&s;t her eyes on him by &s;tealth. They were both under an apprehen&s;ion, but e&s;pecially Cali&s;ta, of being caught by the o|ther in the fact; and yet caught they were almo&s;t every moment.</P>
<P>The hour of &s;eparation came, which to them appeared too &s;udden: melancholy were the re|flections they made on the rapidity of of time. Imagination, however, did not permit, them to be
<PB N="46" REF="019364_0044_0FAB4B7DD82751B0">
entirely ab&s;ent from each other: for the image of Cali&s;ta was deeply engraved on the mind of Agathocles: and his features were as &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on that of Cali&s;ta. They both appear|ed le&s;s cheerful, the re&s;t of the day. A lively &s;entiment, which they did not well comprehend them&s;elves, entirely employed their minds, in &s;pite of every attempt to divert them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Two days pa&s;&s;ed without &s;eeing one another again: and, tho' this interval of time had been filled up either by bu&s;ine&s;s or recreations; yet they both, notwith&s;tanding, experienced a wea|rine&s;s and di&s;&s;atisfaction in their minds, for which they could no way account. But the moment, which brought them together again, explained it to them: the perfect contentment they felt in each other's company, made them &s;en&s;ible of the real &s;ource of their melancholy.</P>
<P>Agathocles took more courage that day: he addre&s;&s;ed Cali&s;ta in a mo&s;t obliging manner, and had the happine&s;s to conver&s;e with her for the fir&s;t time. As yet he had &s;een only her outward charms; but now he di&s;covered the beauty of her mind, the integrity of her heart, the dignity of her &s;entiments, and the delicacy of her wit; but what charmed him the mo&s;t, was the opinion he con|ceived that &s;he did not judge him unworthy of her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>From this time he made her frequent vi&s;its, in every one of which he di&s;covered &s;ome new per|fection in the fair Cali&s;ta. This is the character|i&s;tic of true merit; it gains by being expo&s;ed to the eye of a judicious per&s;on. A man of &s;en&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="019364_0045_0FAB4B7EB7700FF8">
will &s;oon di&s;like a coquette, a fool, or a giddy woman: but if he falls in love with a woman of merit, time, far from weakening, will only &s;trengthen and augment his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fixed inclination of Agathocles convinc|ed him now that what he felt for Cali&s;ta, was love, and that of the mo&s;t tender nature. This he knew; but Cali&s;ta did not as yet know it, or at le&s;t had not learnt it from his lips. Love is ti|merous and diffident. A bold &s;uitor is not the real lover of the lady whom he addre&s;&s;es: he &s;eeks for nothing but plea&s;ure. Agathocles at la&s;t re&s;olved to open his heart to Cali&s;ta; but he did not do it in the affected language of a roman|tic pa&s;&s;ion. "Lovely Cali&s;ta, &s;aid he ingenuou&s;ly, it is not mere e&s;teem that binds me to you, but a mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and tender love. I feel that I cannot live without you: can you without vio|lence to your inclinations, con&s;ent to make me happy? I may love you without offence; 'tis a tribute due to your merit: but may I flatter my|&s;elf with the hopes of &s;ome &s;mall return?"</P>
<P>A coquette would have affected to be di&s;plea&s;|ed at &s;uch a declaration. But Cali&s;ta not only li&s;tened to her lover without interrupting him, but an&s;wered him without ill-nature, and gave him leave to hope. Nor did &s;he put his con&s;tan|cy to a tedious trial: the happine&s;s for which he &s;ighed was no longer delayed than was nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the ceremony. The marriage &s;ettle|ments were ea&s;ily regulated betwixt the parties: for intere&s;t was out of the que&s;tion: the chief ar|ticle con&s;i&s;ted in the mutual exchange of hearts; which was already fulfilled.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="019364_0046_0FAB4B7F62AEEBE8">
What will be the lot of this new-married cou|ple? The happie&s;t, I may venture to foretel, that mortals can enjoy upon earth. No plea&s;ures are compareable to tho&s;e that affect the heart; and there are none, as I have ob&s;erved before, that affect it with &s;uch exqui&s;ite delight, as loving and being beloved. To this tender union we can ne|ver apply the words of Democratus, that <HI>the plea|&s;ure of love is but a &s;hort epilep&s;y.</HI> He meant, with|out doubt, that mere &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, which has &s;o little in it of the nature of love, that a man may enjoy it without loving, and love without ever enjoying it.</P>
<P>They will be con&s;tant in their love. This I dare al&s;o to predict; and I know the rea&s;on. Their affection is not founded on the dazzling charms of beauty: they are both the friends of virtue; they love each other on this account; they will, therefore, continue to love, as long as they are virtuous; and their union it&s;elf is a pledge of their per&s;everance: for nothing &s;o much fecures our continuance in the paths of virtue, as to have perpetually before our eyes the example of a per&s;on whom we love.</P>
<P>Nothing is capable to di&s;turb their happine&s;s, but tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters and misfortunes, from which their love cannot &s;helter them. But, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a rever&s;e of fortune, would not their fate in this regard be common with that of the re&s;t of mankind? Tho&s;e who have never ta&s;ted the plea|&s;ures of love, are not exempt from the like ca&s;ual|ties; and the lover is, at le&s;t, a gainer in regard to tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which con&s;titute no &s;mall part of the happine&s;s of life.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="019364_0047_0FAB4B822498AAE8">
Be&s;ides, even love it&s;elf will greatly dimini&s;h the &s;en&s;e of their misfortunes. For love has the peculiar property of alleviating the &s;ufferings of two fond hearts, and of rendering their plea&s;ures more exqui&s;ite. By this communication of di&s;|tre&s;s, they &s;eem to divide its weight: and, on the contrary, by participation their &s;atisfaction is doubled. As a &s;quadron of hor&s;e is with greater difficulty broke thro' by the enemy, in propor|tion to its clo&s;ene&s;s: &s;o the happy pair re&s;i&s;ts the attacks of adver&s;ity with &s;o much the more &s;trength and &s;ucce&s;s, as they are more clo&s;ely unit|ed.</P>

<P>MORE than forty years ago, an Engli&s;h phi|lo&s;opher, who&s;e works have &s;ince been read and admired by all Europe, re&s;ided at a little town in France. Some di&s;appointments in his native country had fir&s;t driven him abroad, and he was afterward induced to remain there, from having found, in his retreat, where the connections even of nation and language were avoided, a perfect &s;eclu&s;ion and retirement, highly favourable to the developement of ab&s;tract &s;ubjects, in which he excelled all the writers of his time.</P>
<P N="2">2. Perhaps in the &s;tructure of &s;uch a mind, the finer and more delicate &s;en&s;ibilities are &s;eldom

known to have place, or, if originally implanted there, are in a great mea&s;ure extingui&s;hed by the exertions of inten&s;e &s;tudy and profound inve&s;ti|gations. Hence the idea of philo&s;ophy and un|feelingne&s;s being united, has become proverbial, and in common language, the former word is of|ten u&s;ed to expre&s;s the latter. Our philo&s;opher has been cen&s;ured by &s;ome, as deficient in warmth and feeling; but the mildne&s;s of his manners has been allowed by all&punc; and it is certain that if he was not ea&s;ily melted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> compa&s;&s;ion, it was, at le&s;t, not difficult to awaken his benevolence.</P>
<P N="3">3. One morning. while he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at bu&s;ied in tho&s;e &s;peculations which afterwards a&s;toni&s;hed the world, an old female dome&s;tic, who &s;erved him for a hou&s;ekeeper, brought him word, that an el|derly gentleman and his daughter had arrived at the village, the preceding evening, on their way to &s;ome di&s;tant country, and that the father had been &s;uddenly &s;iezed in the night with a dan|gerous di&s;order, which the people of the inn, where they lodged, feared would prove mortal: That &s;he had been &s;ent for, as having &s;ome knowledge of medicine, the village &s;urgeon being then ab&s;ent; and that it was truly piteous to &s;ee the good old man, who &s;eemed not &s;o much af|fected by his own di&s;tre&s;s, as by that which it cau&s;ed to his daughter.</P>
<P N="4">4. Her ma&s;ter laid a&s;ide the volume in his hand, and broke off the chain of ideas it had in|&s;pired. His night-gown was exchanged for a coat and he followed his gouvernan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ick man's apartment. It was the be&s;t in the little
<PB N="51" REF="019364_0049_0FAB4B8DD56F4E00">
inn where they lay, but a pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry one notwith|&s;tanding. Our philo&s;opher was obliged to &s;toop as he entered it. It was floored with earth, and above were the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not pla&s;tered, and hung with cobwebs.</P>
<P N="5">5. On a &s;hock-bed, at one end, lay the old man whom he came to vi&s;it; at the foot of it &s;at his daughter. She was dre&s;&s;ed in a clean white bed-gown; her dark locks hung loo&s;ely over it as &s;he bent forward, watching the languid looks of her father. The philo&s;opher and his hou&s;e|keeper had &s;tood &s;ome moments in the room without the young lady's being &s;en&s;ible of their entering it.</P>
<P N="6">6. Mademoi&s;elle! &s;aid the old woman at la&s;t, in a &s;oft tone. She turned, and &s;howed one of the fine&s;t faces in the world. It was touched not &s;poiled with &s;orrow; and when &s;he perceiv|ed a &s;tranger, whom the old woman now intro|duced to her, a blu&s;h at fir&s;t, and then the gentle ceremonial of native politene&s;s, which the afflic|tion of the time tempered, but did not extingui&s;h, cro&s;&s;ed it for a moment and changed its expre&s;&s;i|on. It was &s;weetne&s;s all, however, and our philo&s;opher felt it &s;trongly.</P>
<P N="7">7. It was not a time for words; he offered his &s;ervices in a few &s;incere ones. "Mon&s;ieur lies mi&s;erably ill here," &s;aid the gouvernante; "If he could po&s;&s;ibly be moved any where." "If he could be moved to our hou&s;e," &s;aid her ma&s;ter. He had a &s;pare bed for a friend, and there was a great room unoccupied next to the gouvernante's. It was contrived accordingly.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="52" REF="019364_0050_0FAB4B8E6D1E6270">
8. The &s;cruples of the &s;tranger, who could look &s;cruples, tho' he could not &s;peak them, were overcome, and the ba&s;hful reluctance of his daughter gave way to her belief of its u&s;e to her father. The &s;ick man was wrapt in blankets and carried acro&s;s the &s;treet to the Engli&s;h gen|tleman's. The old woman helped the daughter to nur&s;e him there. The &s;urgeon, who arrived &s;oon after, pre&s;cribed a little and nature did much for him; in a week he was able to thank his be|nefactor.</P>
<P N="9">9. By that time his ho&s;t had learned the name and character of his gue&s;t. He was a prote&s;tant and clergyman of Switzerland, called <HI>La Roche,</HI> a widower, who had lately buried his wife, after a long and lingering illne&s;s, for which travelling had been pre&s;cribed; and was now returning home, after an ineffectual journey, with his only child, the daughter we have mentioned.</P>
<P N="10">10. He was a devout man, as became his pro|fe&s;&s;ion. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed devotion in all its warmth, but with none of its a&s;perity; I mean that a&s;peri|ty which men, who are called devout, &s;ometimes indulge. The philo&s;opher, tho' he felt no devo|tion, never quarrelled with it in others. His gou|vernante joined the old man and his daughter, in the prayers and thank&s;givings which they put up on his recovery; for &s;he too was a heretic, in the phra&s;e of the village.</P>
<P N="11">11. The philo&s;opher walked out with his long &s;taff and his dog, and left them to their prayers and thank&s;givings. "My ma&s;ter," &s;aid the old woman, "alas! he is not a chri&s;tian; but he is
<PB N="53" REF="019364_0051_0FAB4B8F1FC8CF70">
the be&s;t of unbelievers."&mdash;Not a chri&s;tian! ex|claimed Mademoi&s;elle <HI>La Roche,</HI> "yet he &s;aved my father! Heaven ble&s;s him for it; I would he were a chri&s;tian."</P>
<P N="12">12. "There is a pride in human knowledge, my child," &s;aid her father, "which often blinds men to the &s;ublime truths of revelation; hence there are oppo&s;ers of chri&s;tianity amongmen of virtuous lives, as well as among tho&s;e of di&s;&s;ipated and licentious characters, Nay, &s;ometimes I have known the latter more ea&s;ily converted to the true faith than the former, becau&s;e the fume of pa&s;&s;ion is more ea&s;ily di&s;&s;ipated than the mi&s;t of fal&s;e theory and delu&s;ive &s;peculation." "But this philo&s;opher" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid his daughter, "alas! my father, he &s;hall be a chri&s;tian before he dies."</P>
<P N="13">13. She was interrupted by the arrival of their landlord&mdash;He took her hand with an air of kind|ne&s;s&mdash;She drew it away from him in &s;ilence; threw down her eyes to the ground and left the room. "I have been thanking God," &s;aid the good <HI>La Roche,</HI> "for my recovery." "That is right," replied his landlord. "I &s;hould not wi&s;h," continued the old man, he&s;itatingly, "to think-otherwi&s;e; did I not look up with grati|tude to that Being, I &s;hould barely be &s;atisfied with my recovery, as a continuation of life which, it may be, is not a real good. Alas! I may live to wi&s;h I had died, that you had left me to die, Sir, in&s;tead of kindly relieving me (he cla&s;ped the philo&s;opher's hand); but when I look on this renovated being as the gift of the Almighty, I feel a far different &s;entiment&mdash;my heart dilates
<PB N="54" REF="019364_0052_0FAB4B8FE7BE4D18">
with gratitude and love to him; it is prepared for doing his will, not as a duty, but as a plea|&s;ure, and regards every breach of it, not with di&s;|approbation, but with horror."</P>
<P N="14">14. "You &s;ay right, my dear Sir," replied the Philo&s;opher; "but you are not yet re-e&s;tab|li&s;hed enough to talk much&mdash;you mu&s;t take care of your health, and neither &s;tudy nor preach for &s;ome time. I have been thinking over a &s;cheme that &s;truck me to day, when you mentioned your intended departure. I was never is Switzerland; I have a great mind to accompany your daugh|ter and you into that country. I will help to take care of you by the road; for, as I was your fir&s;t phy&s;ician, I hold my&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for your cure."</P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>La Roche'</HI>s eyes gli&s;tened at the propo&s;al; his daughter was called and told of it. She was equally plea&s;ed with her father; for they really loved their landlord&mdash;not perhaps the le&s;s for his infidelity; at le&s;t that circum&s;tance mixed a &s;ort of pity with their regard for him&mdash;their &s;ouls were not of a mould for har&s;her feelings&mdash;hatred never dwelt with them.</P>
<P N="16">16. They travelled by &s;hort &s;tages; for the philo&s;opher was as good as his word, in taking care that the old man &s;hould not be fatigued. The party had time to be well acquainted with one another, and their friend&s;hip was encrea&s;ed by acquaintance. <HI>La Roche</HI> found a degree of &s;implicity and gentlene&s;s in his companion, which is not always annexed to the character of a learn|ed or a wi&s;e man.</P>
<P N="17"><PB N="55" REF="019364_0053_0FAB4B909D099800">
17. His daughter, who was prepared to be afraid of him, was equally undeceived. She found in him nothing of that &s;elf-importance which &s;u|perior parts, or great cultivation of them is apt to confer. He talked of every thing but philo&s;o|phy and religion; he &s;eemed to enjoy every plea|&s;ure and amu&s;ement of ordinary life, and to be intere&s;ted in the mo&s;t common topics of di&s;|cour&s;e; when his knowledge or learning at any time appeared, it was delivered with the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s and without the le&s;t &s;how of dogma&punc;|ti&s;m.</P>
<P N="18">18. On his part, he was charmed with the &s;o|ciety of the good clergyman and his lovely daughter. He found in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the guilele&s;s man|ner of the earlie&s;t times, with the culture and ac|compli&s;hments of the mo&s;t refined ones. Every better feeling, warm and vivid; every ungentle one, repre&s;&s;ed or overcome. He was not ad|dicted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o love; but he felt him&s;elf happy, in be|ing the friend of <HI>Mademoi&s;elle La Roche,</HI> and &s;ometimes envied her father the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a child.</P>
<P N="19">19. After a journey of eleven days, they ar|rived at the dwelling of <HI>La Roche.</HI> It was &s;itua|ted in one of tho&s;e valleys in the canton of Berne, where nature &s;eems to repo&s;e in quiet, and has en|clo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">her retreat with mountains inacce&s;&s;ible. A &s;trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that &s;pent its fury in the hills above, ran in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ont of the hou&s;e, and a broken water-fall was seen through the woods that covered its &s;ides; below, it circled round a tufted plain, and form|ed a little lake in front of a village, at the end of
<PB N="56" REF="019364_0054_0FAB4B9191D834F0">
which appeared the &s;pire of <HI>La Roche'</HI>s church, ri&s;ing above a clump of beeches.</P>
<P N="20">20. The philo&s;opher enjoyed the beauty of the &s;cene; but to his companions it recalled the memory of a wife and parent they had lo&s;t. The old man's &s;orrow was &s;ilent; his daughter &s;obb'd and wept. Her father took her hand, ki&s;&s;ed it twice, pre&s;&s;ed it to his bo&s;om, threw up his eyes to heaven; and having wiped off a tear that was ju&s;t about to drop from each, began to point out to his gue&s;t &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;triking objects which the pro&s;pect afforded. The philo&s;opher interpreted all this; and he could but &s;lightly cen&s;ure the creed from which it aro&s;e.</P>
<P N="21">21. They had not been long arrived, when a number of <HI>La Roche'</HI>s pari&s;hioners, who had heard of his return, came to the hou&s;e to &s;ee and wel|come him. The hone&s;t folks were awkward, but &s;incere, in their profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip. They made &s;ome attempts at condolence; it was too delicate for their handling; but <HI>La Roche</HI> took it in good part. "It had plea&s;ed God;" &s;aid he and they &s;aw he had &s;ettled the matter with him|&s;elf. Philo&s;ohpy could not have done &s;o much with a thou&s;and words.</P>
<P N="22">22. It was now evening, and the good pea&s;ants were about to depart, when a clock was heard to &s;trike &s;even, and the hour was followed by a par|ticular chime. The country folks, who came to welcome their pa&s;tor, turned their looks towards him at the &s;ound; he explained their meaning to his gue&s;t. "That is the &s;ignal," &s;aid he, "for our evening exerci&s;e; this is one of the nights of
<PB N="57" REF="019364_0055_0FAB4B9242E0A9F0">
the nights of the week in which &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pa|ri&s;hioners are wont to join in it; a little ru&s;tic &s;aloon &s;erves for the chapel of our family, and &s;uch of the good people as are with us; if you choo&s;e rather to walk out, I will furni&s;h you with an attendant; or here are a few old books which may afford you &s;ome entertainment within.</P>
<P N="23">23. "By no means," an&s;wered the philo&s;o|pher; "I will attend Madamoi&s;elle at her de|votions." "She is our organi&s;t," &s;aid <HI>La Roche;</HI> "our neighbourhood is the country of mu&s;ical mechani&s;m, and I have a &s;mall organ, fitted up for the purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;ting our &s;inging." "'Tis an additional inducement," replied the other, and they walked into the room together.</P>
<P N="24">24. At the end &s;tood the organ mentioned by <HI>La Roche;</HI> before it was a curtain, which his daughter drew a&s;ide, and placing her&s;elf on a &s;eat within, and drawing the curtain clo&s;e, &s;o as to &s;ave her the awkwardne&s;s of an exhibition, began a voluntary, &s;olemn and beautiful in the highe&s;t degree. The philo&s;opher was no mu&s;ician, but he was not altogether in&s;en&s;ible to mu&s;ic; this fa&s;tened on his mind more &s;trongly, from its beauty being unexpected.</P>

<P N="27">27. <HI>La Roche'</HI>s religion was that of &s;entiment, not theory, and his gue&s;t was aver&s;e from di&s;pu|tation; their di&s;cour&s;e did not therefore lead to que&s;tions concerning the belief of either; yet would the old man &s;ometimes &s;peak of his, from the feelings of a heart impre&s;&s;ed with its force and wi&s;hing to &s;pread the plea&s;ure he enjoyed in it. The ideas of his God, and his Saviour were &s;o congenial to his mind, that every emotion of it naturally awakened them. A philo&s;opher might have called him an enthu&s;ia&s;t; but if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fervour of enthu&s;ia&s;ts, he was guilt|le&s;s of their bigotry.

<P N="29">29.

<P N="34">34.

<P N="35">35. About three years after, our philo&s;opher was on a vi&s;it at Geneva; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he made to <HI>La Roche</HI> and his daughter, on his former vi|&s;it, was recalled to his mind, by the view of that range of mountains, on a part of which they had often looked together. There was a reproach too,

conveyed along with the recollection, for his hav|ing failed to write to either of them for &s;everal months pa&s;t. The truth was, that indolence was the habit mo&s;t natural to him, from which he was not ea&s;ily rou&s;ed by the claims of corre&s;pondence, either of his friends or his enemies; when the latter drew their pens in controver&s;y, they were often an&s;wered as well as the former.</P>
<P N="36">36. While he was he&s;itating about a visit to <HI>La Roche,</HI> which he wi&s;hed to make, but found the effort rather too much for him, he received a let|ter from the old man, which had been forwarded to him from Paris, where he had then fixed his re&s;idence. It contained a gentle complaint of the Philo&s;opher's want of punctuality, but an a&s;|&s;urance of continued gratitude for his former good offices, and, as a friend whom the writer con&s;idered intere&s;ted in his family, it informed him of the approaching nuptials of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>La Roche,</HI> with a young man, a relation of her own and formerly a pupil of her father's, of the mo&s;t noble di&s;po&s;itions and re&s;pectable character.</P>
<P N="37">37. Attached from their earlie&s;t years, they had been &s;eparated by his joining one of the &s;ub&s;idiary regiments of the Canton, then in the &s;ervice of a foreign power. In this &s;ituation, he had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf as much for courage and military &s;kill, as for the other endowments which he had cultivated at home. The term of his &s;ervice was now expired and they expected him to re|turn in a few weeks, when the old man hoped, as he expre&s;&s;ed it in his letter, to join their hands and &s;ee them happy before he died.</P>
<P N="38"><PB N="62" REF="019364_0060_0FAB4BA1DD4921A0">
38. Our philo&s;opher felt him&s;elf intere&s;ted in this event; but he was not, perhaps, altogether &s;o happy in the tidings of Mademoi&s;elle <HI>La Roche's</HI> marriage, as her father &s;uppo&s;ed him. Not that he ever was a lover of the Lady; but he thought her one of the mo&s;t amiable women he had &s;een, and there was &s;omething in the idea of her being another's for ever, that &s;truck him, he knew not why, like a di&s;appointment. After &s;ome little &s;peculation on the matter, however, he could look on it as a thing fitting, if not quite agreeable, and determined on his vi&s;it to &s;ee his old friend and his daughter happy.</P>
<P N="39">39. On the la&s;t day of his journey, different ac|cidents had retarded his progre&s;s; he was be|nighted before he reached the quarter in which <HI>La Roche</HI> re&s;ided. His guide however, was well acquainted with the road and he found him&s;elf in view of the lake, which I have before de&s;cribed, in the neighbourhood of <HI>La Roche's</HI> dwelling. A light gleamed on the water, that &s;eemed to proceed from the hou&s;e; it moved &s;lowly along as he proceeded up the &s;ide of the lake and at la&s;t he &s;aw it glimmering through the trees and &s;top at &s;ome di&s;tance from the place where he then was.</P>
<P N="40">40. He &s;uppo&s;ed it &s;ome piece of bridal merri|ment, and pu&s;hed on his hor&s;e that he might be a &s;pectator of the &s;cene; but he was a good deal &s;hocked, on approaching the &s;pot, to find it pro|ceeded from the torch of a per&s;on clothed in the dre&s;s of an attendant on a funeral, and accompa|nied by &s;everal others, who like him, &s;eemed to

have been employed in the rites of &s;epulture.</P>
<P N="41">41. On the philo&s;opher's making enquiry who was the per&s;on they had been burying? one of them, with an accent more mournful than is common to their profe&s;&s;ion, an&s;wered, "Then you knew not Mademoi&s;elle, Sir! you never beheld a lovlier." <HI>La Roche!"</HI> exclaimed he in reply"&mdash;"Alas it was &s;he indeed!" The ap|pearance of grief and &s;urpri&s;e which his counte|nance a&s;&s;umed, attracted the notice of the pea|&s;ant with whom he talked.</P>
<P N="42">42. He came up clo&s;e to the philo&s;opher&mdash;"I preceive, Sir, you were acquainted with Ma|demoi&s;elle <HI>La Roche."</HI> "Acquainted with her: Good God! when&mdash;how&mdash;where did &s;he die? Where is her father." "She died, Sir, of heart|break, I believe; the young gentleman to whom &s;he was &s;oon to be married, was killed, in a duel by a French Officer, his intimate companion, and to whom, before their quarrel, he had often done the greate&s;t favours&punc;"</P>
<P N="43">43. "Her worthy father bears her death, as he has often told us a Chri&s;tian &s;hould; he is even &s;o compo&s;ed as to be now in his pulpit, ready to deliver a few exhortations to his pari&s;hioners, as is his cu&s;tom with us on &s;uch occa&s;ions. Follow me, Sir, and you &s;hall hear him." He followed the man without an&s;wering.</P>
<P N="44">44. The Church was dimly lighted, except near the pulpit, where the venerable <HI>La Roche</HI> was &s;eated. His people were now lifting up their voices to that being whom their pa&s;tor had taught them ever to ble&s;s and revere. <HI>La Roche</HI> &s;at, his figure bending gently forward, his eyes half-clo&s;ed
<PB N="64" REF="019364_0062_0FAB4BA35AA5E258">
lifted up in &s;ilent devotion. A lamp pla|ced near him, threw its light &s;trongly on his head and marked the &s;hadowy lines of his age acro&s;s the palene&s;s of his brow, thinly covered with grey hairs.</P>
<P N="45">45. The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed,&mdash;<HI>La Roche</HI> &s;at for a moment and nature wrung a few tears from him. His people were loud in their grief. The philo|&s;opher was not le&s;s affected then they. <HI>La Roche</HI> aro&s;e. "Father of mercies" I &s;aid he, "forgive the&s;e tears; a&s;&s;i&s;t thy &s;ervant to lift up his &s;oul to thee; to lift to thee the &s;ouls of thy people! My friends! it is good &s;o to do; at all &s;ea&s;ons it is good; but in the days of our di&s;tre&s;s, what a pri|vilege it is!

When every other &s;upport fails us, when the fountains of worldly comfort are dried up, let us then &s;eek tho&s;e living waters which flow from the throne of God. It is only from the belief of the goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom of a &s;upreme Being that our calamities can be borne in the manner which becomes a man."</P>
<P N="46">46. "Human wi&s;dom is here of little u&s;e; for in proportion as it be&s;tows comfort, it repre&s;&s;es feeling, without which we may cea&s;e to be hurt by calamity, but we &s;hall al&s;o cea&s;e to enjoy happi|ne&s;s.

<P N="47">47. "You behold the mourner of his only child, the la&s;t earthly &s;tay and ble&s;&s;ing of his de|clining years!

But I look to|wards him who &s;truck me; I &s;ee the hand of a father amid&s;t the cha&s;tenings of my God."</P>
<P N="48">48.

50. Such was the exortation of <HI>La Roche;</HI> his audience an&s;wered it with tears. The good old man had dried up his at the altar of the Lord; his countenance had lo&s;t its &s;adne&s;s and a&s;&s;umed the glow of faith and hope. The philo&s;opher followed him into his hou&s;e. The in&s;pir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tion of the pulpit was pa&s;t; the &s;cenes, they had la&s;t met in, ru&s;hed again on his mind; <HI>La Roche</HI> threw his arms around his neck and watered it with his tears. The other was equally affected; they went together in &s;ilence into the parlour, where the evening &s;ervice was wont to be performed.</P>
<P N="51">51. The curtains of the organ were open; <HI>La Roche</HI> &s;tarted back at the &s;ight.&mdash;"Oh my friend," &s;aid he and his tears bur&s;t forth again. The philo&s;opher had now recollected him&s;elf; he &s;tept forward and drew the curtain clo&s;e&mdash;the old man wiped off his tears and taking his friend by the hand, "You &s;ee my weakne&s;s," and he, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the weakne&s;s of humanity; but my comfort is not therefore lo&s;t."

<P>IF we examine impartially that e&s;timate of plea|&s;ure, which the higher ranks of &s;ociety <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> to form, we &s;hall probably be &s;urpri&s;ed to find how little there is in it, either of natural feeling or real &s;atisfaction. Many a fa&s;hionable volup|tuary, who has not totally blunted his ta&s;te or his judgement, will own, in the intervals of recol|lection, how often he has &s;uffered from the in&s;ipi|dity or the pain of his enjoyments; and that, if it were not for the fear of being laughed at, it would &s;ometimes be worth while, even on the &s;core of plea&s;ure, to be virtuous.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> to whom I had the plea&s;ure of being introduced at Florence, was a character much beyond that which di&s;tingui&s;hes the gene|rality of Engli&s;h travellers of fortune.</P>
<P>His &s;tory was known to &s;ome of his country|men who then re&s;ided in Italy; from one of whom, who could now and then talk of &s;omething be&s;ides pictures and operas, I had a particular recital of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. He had been abroad at an early period of
<PB N="68" REF="019364_0066_0FAB4BB349510668">
life, &s;oon after the death of his father had left him ma&s;ter of a very large e&s;tate, which he had the good fortune to inherit, and all the inclinati|on natural to youth to enjoy. Though always &s;umptuous, however, and &s;ometimes profu&s;e, he was ob&s;erved never to be ridiculous in his ex|pen&s;es; and though he was now and then talk|ed of as a man of plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation, he al|ways left behind him more in&s;tances of benefi|cence, than of irregularity.</P>
<P N="4">4. For that re&s;pect and e&s;teem in which his character, amid&s;t all his little errors, was general|ly held, he was &s;uppo&s;ed a good deal indebted to the &s;ociety of a gentleman who had been his companion at the univer&s;ity, and now attended him rather as a friend than a tutor. This gentle|man was unfortunately &s;eized at Mar&s;eilles with a lingering di&s;order, for which he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking a &s;ea-voyage, leaving Sir <HI>Ed|ward</HI> to pro&s;ecute the remaining part of his in|tended tour alone.</P>
<P N="5">5. De&s;cending into one of their valleys of Piedmont, where notwith&s;tanding the ruggedne&s;s of the road, Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> with a prejudice natu|ral to his country, preferred the conveyance of an Engli&s;h hunter to that of an Italian mule, his hor&s;e unluckily made of fal&s;e &s;tep and fell with his rider to the ground, from which Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was lifted by his &s;ervants with &s;carce any &s;igns of life. They conveyed him on a litter to the neare&s;t hou&s;e, which happened to be the dwelling of a pea&s;ant rather above the common rank, before who&s;e door &s;ome of his neighbours were a&s;&s;em|bled
<PB N="69" REF="019364_0067_0FAB4BBB11743748">
at a &s;cene of rural merriment, when the train of Sir <HI>Edward</HI> brought up their ma&s;ter in the condition I have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P N="6">6. The compa&s;&s;ion, natural to his &s;ituation, was excited in all; but the owner of the man&s;ion, who&s;e name was <HI>Venoni,</HI> was particularly moved with it. He applied him&s;elf immediately to the care of the &s;tranger, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his daughter, who had left the dance &s;he was engag|ed in, with great marks of agitation, &s;oon re&s;tor|ed Sir <HI>Edward</HI> to &s;en&s;e and life.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Venoni</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome little &s;kill in &s;urgery and his daughter produced a book of receipts in medicine. Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> after being blooded, was put to bed and tended with every po&s;&s;ible care by his ho&s;t and his family. A con&s;iderable degree of fever was the con&s;equence of his acci|dent; but after &s;ome days it abated: and in lit|tle more than a week, he was able to join in the &s;ociety of <HI>Venoni</HI> and his daughter.</P>
<P N="8">8. He could not help expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at the appearance of refinement in the conver&s;ati|on of the latter, much beyond what her &s;ituation &s;eemed likely to confer. Her father accounted for it. She had received her education in the hou&s;e of a Lady, who happened to pa&s;s through the valley, and to take &s;helter in <HI>Venoni'</HI>s cottage (for his hou&s;e was but a better &s;ort of cottage) the night after her birth.</P>
<P N="9">9. "When her mother died," &s;aid he, "the Signora, who&s;e name, at her de&s;ire, we had given the child, took her home to her own hou&s;e; there &s;he was taught many things of which there is no

<P N="10">10. But Sir <HI>Edward</HI> had now an opportunity of knowing <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> better than from the de&s;cripti|on of her father. Mu&s;ic and painting, in both which arts &s;he was a tolerable proficient, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> had &s;tudied with &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> felt a &s;ort of plea&s;ure from her drawings, which they had never given her before, when they were prai&s;ed by Sir <HI>Edward;</HI> and the family concerts of <HI>Venoni</HI> were very different from what they had formerly been, when once his gue&s;t was &s;o far re|covered as to be able to join in them. The flute of <HI>Venoni</HI> excelled all the other mu&s;ic of the val|ley; his daughter's lute was much beyond it; Sir <HI>Edward'</HI>s violin was finer than either.</P>

But his conver&s;ation with <HI>Loui&s;a</HI>&mdash;It was that of a &s;uperior order of beings! &s;cience, ta&s;te, &s;entiment! it was long &s;ince <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> had heard the&s;e &s;ounds; amid&s;t the ignorance of the valley, it was luxury to hear them; from Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> who was one of the mo&s;t engaging figures I ever &s;aw, they were doubly delightful. In his coun|tenance there was always an expre&s;&s;ion animated and intere&s;ting; his &s;ickne&s;s had overcome &s;ome|what of the fir&s;t, but greatly added to the power of the latter.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Loui&s;a'</HI>s was no le&s;s captivating and Sir <HI>Ed|ward</HI> had not beheld it &s;o long without emotion. During his illne&s;s, he thought this emotion but gra|titude, and when it fir&s;t grew warmer, he checked
<PB N="71" REF="019364_0069_0FAB4BBC2E951450">
it, from the thought of her &s;ituation and of the debt he owed her. But the &s;truggle was too ineffectu|al to overcome, and of con&s;equence increa&s;ed, his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="13">13. There was but one way in which the pride of Sir <HI>Edward</HI> allowed of its being gratified. He &s;ometimes thought of this as ba&s;e and unworthy; but he was the fool of words which he had often de&s;pi&s;ed, the &s;lave of manners which he had of|ten condemned. He at la&s;t compromi&s;ed mat|ters with him&s;elf; he re&s;olved, it he could, to think no more of <HI>Loui&s;a:</HI> at any rate, to think no more of the ties of gratitude or the re&s;traints of virtue.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> who tru&s;ted to both, now commu|nicated to Sir E<HI>dward</HI> an important &s;ecret. It was at the clo&s;e of a piece of mu&s;ic, which they had been playing in the ab&s;ence of her father. She took up her lute and touched a little wild melancholy air, which &s;he had compo&s;ed to the memory of her mother. "That," &s;aid &s;he, "no|body ever heard except my father; I play it &s;ome|times when I am alone and in low &s;pirits. I know not how I came to think of it now; yet I have &s;ome rea&s;on to be &s;ad."</P>
<P N="15">15. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> pre&s;&s;ed to know the cau&s;e; after &s;ome he&s;itation &s;he told it all. Her father had fixed on the &s;on of a neighbour, rich in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, but rude in manners, for her hu&s;band. Again&s;t this match &s;he had always prote&s;ted as &s;trongly, as a &s;en&s;e of duty and the mildne&s;s of her nature would allow; but <HI>Venoni</HI> was ob&s;tinately bent on the match, and &s;he was wretched from the
<PB N="72" REF="019364_0070_0FAB4BBCE21B6E18">
thoughts of it. "To marry where one cannot love,&mdash;to marry &s;uch a man, Sir <HI>Edward!"</HI> It was an opportunity beyond his power of re&s;i&s;tance. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> pre&s;&s;ed her hand; &s;aid it would be profanation to think of &s;uch a marriage; prai&s;|ed her beauty, extolled her virtues; and con|cluded by &s;wearing that he adored her.</P>
<P N="16">16. She heard him with un&s;u&s;pecting plea&s;ure, which her blu&s;hes could ill conceal. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> improved the favourable moment; talked of the ardency of his pa&s;&s;ion, the in&s;ignificancy of cere|monies and forms, the inefficacy of legal engage|ments, the eternal duration of tho&s;e dictated by love; and in fine, urged her going off with him, to crown both their days with happine&s;s. <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> &s;tarted at the propo&s;al. She would have reproach|ed him, but her heart was not made for it; &s;he could only weep.</P>
<P N="17">17. They were interrupted by the arrival of her father with his intended &s;on-in-law. He was ju&s;t &s;uch a man as <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> had repre&s;ented him, coar&s;e, vulgar and ignorant. But <HI>Venoni,</HI> tho' much above their neighbour in every thing but riches, looked on him as poorer men often look on the wealthy, and di&s;covered none of his im|perfections. He took his daughter a&s;ide, told her he had brought her future hu&s;band, and that he intended they &s;hould be married in a week at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P N="18">18. Next morning <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> was indi&s;po&s;ed, and kept her chamber. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was now per|fectly recovered. He was engaged to go out with <HI>Venoni;</HI> but before his departure, he took
<PB N="73" REF="019364_0071_0FAB4BBDD705B128">
up his violin and touched a few plaintive notes on it. They were heard by <HI>Loui&s;a.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. In the evening &s;he wandered forth to in|dulge her &s;orrows alone. She had reached a &s;e|que&s;tered &s;pot, where &s;ome poplars formed a thicket, on the banks of a little &s;tream that wa|tered the valley. A nightingale was perched on one of them and had already begun its accu&s;tom|ed &s;ong. <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> &s;at down on a withered &s;tump, leaning her cheek upon her hand.</P>
<P N="20">20. After a little while, the bird was &s;cared from its perch, and flitted from the thicket. <HI>Lou|i&s;a</HI> ro&s;e from the ground and bur&s;t into tears! She turned, and beheld Sir <HI>Edward.</HI> His coun|tenance had much of its former langour; and when he took her hand, he ca&s;t on the earth a melancholy look and &s;eemed unable to &s;peak his feelings.</P>
<P N="21">21. "Are you not well Sir <HI>Edward?"</HI> &s;aid <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> with a voice faint and broken. "I am ill indeed" &s;aid he, "but my illne&s;s is of the mind. <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> cannot cure me of that. I am wretched; but I de&s;erve to be &s;o. I have broken every law of ho&s;pitality and every obligation of gratitude. I have dared to wi&s;h for happine&s;s and to &s;peak what I wi&s;hed, though it wound|ed the heart of my deare&s;t benefactor&mdash;but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will make a &s;evere expiation."</P>
<P N="22">22. "This moment I leave you, <HI>Loui&s;a!</HI> I go to be wretched; but you may be happy; happy in your duty to a father, happy, it may be, in the arms of a hu&s;band, whom the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a wi&s;e may teach refinement and &s;en&s;ibility. I
<PB N="74" REF="019364_0072_0FAB4BBE559FDF98">
go to my native country, to hurry through &s;cenes of irk&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s or ta&s;tele&s;s amu&s;ements; that I may, if po&s;&s;ible, procure a &s;ort of half-oblivion of that happine&s;s which I left behind, a li&s;tle&s;s en|durance of that life which I once dreamed might be made delightful with <HI>Loui&s;a."</HI></P>
<P N="23">23. Tear&s;&punc; were the only an&s;wer &s;he could give. Sir <HI>Edward'</HI>s &s;ervants appeared, with a carriage, ready for his departure. He took from his pocket two pictures; one he had drawn of <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> he fa&s;tened it round his neck, and ki&s;&s;ing it with rapture, hid it in his bo&s;om. The other he held out in a he&s;itating manner. "This," &s;aid he, "if <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> will accept of it, may &s;ome|times put her in mind of him who once offended, who can never cea&s;e to adore her. She may look on it perhaps after the original is no more; when this heart &s;hall have forgot to love and cea&s;ed to be wretched."</P>
<P N="24">24. <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> was at la&s;t overcome. Her face was fir&s;t pale as death; then &s;uddenly, it was cro&s;&s;ed with a crim&s;on blu&s;h. "Oh! Sir <HI>Edward!"</HI> &s;aid &s;he, "what&mdash;what would you have me do!" He eagerly &s;eized her hand and led her, reluctant, to the carriage. They entered it and driving off with furious &s;peed, were &s;oon out of &s;ight of tho&s;e hills which pa&s;tured the flocks of the unfortunate <HI>Venoni.</HI></P>
<P N="25">25. The virtue of <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> was vanqui&s;hed; but her sense of virtue was not overcome. Nei|ther the vows of eternal fidelity of her &s;educer, nor the con&s;tant and re&s;pectful attention, which he paid her, during a hurried, journey to England, could
<PB N="75" REF="019364_0073_0FAB4BBF1CF8D308">
allay that angui&s;h which &s;he &s;uffered at the recol|lection of her pa&s;t, and the thoughts of her pre|&s;ent &s;ituation. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> felt &s;trongly the pow|er of her beauty and of her grief. His heart was not made for that part which, it is probable, he thought it could have performed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it was &s;till &s;ub|ject to remor&s;e, to compa&s;&s;ion and to love.</P>
<P N="26">26. The&s;e emotions perhaps, he might &s;oon have overcome, had they been met by vulgar vi|olence or reproaches; but the quiet and up|braiding &s;orrows of <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> nouri&s;hed tho&s;e feel|ings of tenderne&s;s and attachment. She never mentioned her wrongs in words; &s;ometimes a few &s;tarting tears would &s;peak them; and when time had given her a little more compo&s;ure, her lute di&s;cour&s;ed melancholy mu&s;ic.</P>
<P N="27">27. On their arrival in England, Sir <HI>Edward</HI> carried <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> to his &s;eat in the country. There &s;he was treated with all the ob&s;ervance of a wife; and, had &s;he cho&s;en it, might have commanded more than the ordinary &s;plendor of one. But &s;he would not allow the indulgence of Sir <HI>Edward</HI> to blazen with equipage, and &s;how that &s;tate which &s;he wi&s;hed always to hide, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to for|get. Her books and her mu&s;ic were her only plea&s;ure; if plea&s;ure they could be called, that &s;erved but to alleviate mi&s;ery, and, to blunt, for a while, the pangs of contrition.</P>
<P N="28">28. The&s;e were deeply aggravated by the recol|lection of her father; a father left in his age to feel his own misfortunes and his daughter's di&s;grace. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was too generous not to think of pro|viding for <HI>Venoni.</HI> He meant to make &s;ome atone|ment
<PB N="76" REF="019364_0074_0FAB4BBFD493FD78">
for the injury he had done him, by that cruel bounty which is reparation only to the ba&s;e, but to the hone&s;t, is in&s;ult. He had not, howe|ver, an opportunity of accompli&s;hing his pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P N="29">29. He learned that <HI>Venoni,</HI> &s;oon after his daughter's elopement, removed from his former place of re&s;idence, and as his neighbours had reported, had died in one of the village of Savoy. His daughter felt this with angui&s;h the mo&s;t poignant, and her affliction, for a while, refu&s;ed con&s;olation. Sir <HI>Edward'</HI>s whole tenderne&s;s and attention were called forth to mitigate her grief; and after its fir&s;t tran&s;ports had &s;ub&s;ided, he car|ried her to London in hopes that objects new to her and commonly attractive to all, might con|tribute to remove it.</P>
<P N="30">30. With a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of feelings like Sir <HI>Edward'</HI>s, the affliction of <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> gave a certain re&s;pect to his attentions. He hired her a hou&s;e &s;eparate from his own, and treated her with all the delicacy of the pure&s;t attachment. But his &s;olicitude to comfort and amu&s;e her was not at|tended with &s;ucce&s;s. She felt all the horrors of that guilt which &s;he now con&s;idered, as not only the ruin of her&s;elf, but the murderer of her father.</P>
<P N="31">31. In London Sir <HI>Edward</HI> found his &s;i&s;ter, who had married a man of great fortune and high fa&s;hion. He had married her, becau&s;e &s;he was a fine woman, and admired by fine men; &s;he had married him, becau&s;e he was the wealthi|e&s;t of her &s;uitors. They lived, as is common to
<PB N="77" REF="019364_0075_0FAB4BC5D4B33D78">
people in &s;uch a &s;ituation, nece&s;&s;itous with a princely revenue, and very wretched amid&s;t per|petual gaiety.</P>
<P N="32">32. This &s;cene was &s;o foreign from the idea Sir <HI>Edward</HI> had formed of the reception which his country and his friends were to afford him, that he found a con&s;tant &s;ource of di&s;gu&s;t in the &s;ociety of his equals. In their conver&s;ation fan|ta&s;tic, not refined, their ideas were frivolous and their knowledge, &s;hallow; and with all the pride of birth and in&s;olence of &s;tation, their principles were mean and their minds ignoble. In their pretended attachments, he di&s;covered only de|&s;igns of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; and their plea&s;ures, he ex|perienced, were as fallacious as their friend&s;hips.</P>
<P N="33">33. In the &s;ociety of <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> he found &s;en&s;ibi|lity and truth; hers was the only heart that &s;eemed intere&s;ted in his welfare: &s;he &s;aw the re|turn of virtue in Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> and felt the friend|&s;hip which he &s;hewed her. Sometimes, when &s;he perceived him &s;orrowful, her lute would leave its melancholy for more lively airs, and her coun|tenance a&s;&s;umed a gaiety it was not formed to wear. But her heart was breaking with that angui&s;h which her genero&s;ity endeavoured to conceal from him; her frame, too delicate for the &s;truggle of her feelings, &s;eemed to yield to their force; the colour faded in her cheek, the lustre of her eyes grew dim.</P>
<P N="34">34. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> &s;aw the&s;e &s;ymptoms of decay with the deepe&s;t remor&s;e. Often did he cur&s;e tho&s;e fal&s;e ideas of plea&s;ure, which had led him to con&s;ider the ruin of an artle&s;s girl, who loved
<PB N="78" REF="019364_0076_0FAB4BC69BB47FB0">
and tru&s;ted him, as an object which it was luxury to attain. Often did he wi&s;h to blot out from his life a few guilty months, to be again re&s;tored to an opportunity of giving happine&s;s to that family, who&s;e un&s;u&s;pecting kindne&s;s he had re|paid with the treachery of a robber, and the cru|elty of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P N="35">35. One evening, while he &s;at in a little parlour with <HI>Loui&s;a,</HI> his mind alternately agitated and &s;oftened with this impre&s;&s;ion, a <HI>hand-organ</HI> of a remarkable &s;weet tone, was heard in the &s;treet; <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> laid a&s;ide her lute and li&s;tened: the airs it played were tho&s;e of her native country, and a few tears which &s;he endeavoured to hide, &s;tole from her on hearing them. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> ordered a &s;ervant to fetch the organi&s;t into the room: he was brought in accordingly and &s;eated at the door of the apartment.</P>
<P N="36">36. He played one or two &s;prightly tunes, to which <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> had often danced in her infancy: &s;he gave her&s;elf up to the recollection, and her tears flowed without control. Suddenly the mu|&s;ician changing the &s;top, introduced a little me|lancholy air of a wild and plaintive kind. <HI>Loui&s;a</HI> &s;tarted from her &s;eat and ru&s;hed up to the &s;trang|er.&mdash;He threw off a tattered and black patch. It was her father! &s;he would have &s;prung to em|brace him; he turned a&s;ide for a few moments and would not receive her into his arms. But nature at la&s;t overcame his re&s;entment; he bur&s;t into tears and pre&s;&s;ed to his bo&s;om his long-lo&s;t daughter.</P>
<P N="37">37. Sir <HI>Edward</HI> &s;tood fixed in a&s;toni&s;hment
<PB N="79" REF="019364_0077_0FAB4BCA9E990200">
and confu&s;ion.&mdash;"I come not to upbraid you," &s;aid <HI>Venoni;</HI> "I am a poor, weak, old man, un|able for upbraidings; I am come but to find my child, to forgive her, and to die! When you &s;aw us fir&s;t, Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> we were not thus. You found us virtuous and happy; we danced and we &s;ung, and there was not a &s;ad heart in the valley where we dwelt. Yet we left our dancing, our &s;ongs and our cheerfulne&s;s; you were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and we pitied you."</P>
<P N="38">38. "Since that day the pipe has never been heard in <HI>Venoni'</HI>s fields; grief and &s;ickne&s;s have brought him almo&s;t to the grave; and his neigh|bours who loved and pitied him, have been cheerful no more.

<P N="39">39. "But &s;he &s;hall &s;hed no more," cried Sir <HI>Ed|ward;</HI> "you &s;hall be happy and I will be ju&s;t.

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. EMILIUS, or Dome&s;tic Happine&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THE government of a family depends on &s;uch various and oppo&s;ite principles, that it is a matter of extreme delicacy. Perhaps there is no &s;ituation in life in which it is &s;o difficult to be|have with propriety, as in the conte&s;t between <HI>pa|rental authority</HI> and <HI>parental love.</HI> This is un|doubtedly the rea&s;on why we &s;ee &s;o few happy fa|milies. Few parents are both loved and re&s;pect|ed, becau&s;e mo&s;t of them are either the dupes or the tyrants of their children.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some parents, either from a natural weak|ne&s;s of mind, or an exce&s;s of fondne&s;s, permit and even encourage their children in a thou&s;and little familiarities, which render them ridiculous and by dimini&s;hing the re&s;pect which is due to their age and &s;tation, de&s;troy all their authority. Others, ruled by a partial and blind affection,
<PB N="81" REF="019364_0079_0FAB4BCCC16C97F0">
which can deny nothing to its object, indulge their children in all their romantic wi&s;hes, how|ever trifling and fooli&s;h; however degrading to their dignity or injurious to their welfare. Others, &s;oured by misfortunes, or grown peevi&s;h and jealous by the lo&s;s of youthful plea&s;ures, and an acquainta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce with the deceit and the folly of the world, attempt to re&s;train the ideas and the en|joyments of youth by the rigid maxims of age.</P>
<P N="3">3. The children of the fir&s;t cla&s;s often offend by &s;illy manners and a kind of good-natured di&s;|re&s;pect. Tho&s;e of the &s;econd, are generally proud, whim&s;ical and vitious. Tho&s;e of the third, if they are &s;ubdued, when young, by the rigour of parental di&s;cipline, forever remain moro&s;e illibe|ral and un&s;ociable; or if, as it commonly hap|pens, they find means to e&s;cape from re&s;traint, they abandon them&s;elves to every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pecies of li|centiou&s;ne&s;s. To parents of the&s;e de&s;criptions may be added another cla&s;s, who&s;e fondne&s;s blinds their eyes to the mo&s;t glaring vices of their chil|dren; or invents &s;uch palliations as to prevent the mo&s;t &s;alutary corrections.</P>
<P N="4">4. The ta&s;te for amu&s;ements in young people is, of all others, the mo&s;t difficult to regulate by the maxims of prudence. In this article, pa|rents are apt to err, either by extreme indulgence on one hand or immoderate rigour on the other. Recollecting the feelings of their youth, they give unbounded licence to the inclinations of their children; or having lo&s;t all reli&s;h for amu&s;e|ments, they refu&s;e to gratify their mo&s;t moderate de&s;ires.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="82" REF="019364_0080_0FAB4BCD9BC5C1A8">
5. It is a maxim which univer&s;ally holds true, that the be&s;t method of guarding youth from <HI>criminal</HI> plea&s;ures, is to indulge them freely in tho&s;e that are <HI>innocent.</HI> A per&s;on who has free acce&s;s to reputeable &s;ociety, will have little incli|nation to frequent that which is vitious. But tho&s;e, who are kept under con&s;tant re&s;traint, who are &s;eldom indulged in amu&s;ements, who are per|petually awed by the frowns of a parent, or &s;our|ed by a di&s;appointment of their mo&s;t harmle&s;s wi&s;hes, will at times break over all bounds to gratify their ta&s;te for plea&s;ure, and will not be anxious to di&s;criminate between the innocent and the criminal.</P>
<P N="6">6. Nothing contributes more to keep youth within the limits of decorum, than to have their &s;uperiors mingle in their company, at proper times, and participate of their amu&s;ements. This conde&s;cen&s;ion flatters their pride; at the &s;ame time, that re&s;pect for age, which no familiarities can wholly efface, naturally checks the extrava|gant &s;allies of mirth, and the indelicate rudene&s;&s;es which young people are apt to indulge in their jovial hours.</P>
<P N="7">7. That awful di&s;tance at which &s;ome parents keep their children, and their abhorrence of all juvenile diver&s;ions, which compel youth to &s;a|crifice their mo&s;t innocent de&s;ires, or veil the gra|tification of them with the mo&s;t anxious &s;ecrecy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> direct a tendency to drive young per&s;ons into a profligate life, as the force of vitious ex|amples. It is impo&s;&s;ible to give, to the age of <HI>twenty,</HI> the feelings or the knowledge of <HI>&s;ixty;</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="019364_0081_0FAB4BCE2ADBD510">
as it would be folly to wi&s;h to clothe a child with grey hairs, or to &s;tamp the fading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> autumn on the bloom of May. Nature has giv|en to every age &s;ome peculiar pa&s;&s;ions and ap|petites; to moderate and refine the&s;e, not to &s;tifle and de&s;troy, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of common pru|dence and parental care.</P>
<P N="8">8. I was led into this train of reflections by an acquaintance with the family of Emilius, which is a rare in&s;tance of dome&s;tic felicity. Parents in|dulgent to their children, ho&s;pitable to their friends and univer&s;ally re&s;pected; their &s;ons equal|ly generous, mode&s;t and manly; Emilia, an on|ly daughter, the pride of her parents, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every accompli&s;hment that can honour her&s;elf, or endear her to her friends; an ea&s;y fortune and a di&s;po&s;ition to enjoy and improve it to the purpo&s;es of humanity; perfect harmony in dome&s;tic life and unaffected &s;atisfaction in the plea&s;ures of &s;o|ciety: Such is the family of Emilius.</P>
<P N="9">9. Such a family is a little paradi&s;e on earth; to envy their happine&s;s is almo&s;t a virtue. Con|jugal re&s;pect, parental tenderne&s;s, filial obedience and brotherly kindne&s;s are &s;o &s;eldom united, in a family, that when I am honoured with the friend|&s;hip of &s;uch, I am equally ambitious to participate their happine&s;s and profit by the example.</P>
<P N="10">10. Emilia's &s;ituation mu&s;t be peculiarly a|greeable. Her parents delight to gratify her in every amu&s;ement; and contented with this, &s;he knows no wi&s;h beyond the &s;acred bounds of ho|nour. While, by their indulgence, &s;he enjoys e|very rational plea&s;ure, &s;he rewards their generous
<PB N="84" REF="019364_0082_0FAB4BCEE3B92FF8">
care, by a dutiful behaviour and unblemi&s;hed manners.</P>
<P N="11">11. By thus di&s;charging the reciprocal duties of their re&s;pective &s;tations, the happine&s;s of each is &s;ecured. The &s;olicitude of the parent and the obedience of the child, equally contribute to the bli&s;s of the little &s;ociety; the one calling forth every act of tenderne&s;s, and the other di&s;played in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the filial virtues.</P>
<P N="12">12. Few families are de&s;tined to be &s;o happy as that of Emilius. Were I to choo&s;e the &s;itua|tion where I could pa&s;s my life with mo&s;t &s;ati&s;|faction, it would be in this dome&s;tic circle. My hou&s;e would then be the re&s;idence of delight, unmingled with the anxieties of ambition or the regret of di&s;appiontment. Every act would be dictated by love and re&s;pect; every countenance would wear the &s;mile of complacence; and the little unavoidable troubles, incident to the hap|pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;ituation, would only &s;erve to increa&s;e our friend&s;hip and improve our felicity, by making room for the exerci&s;e of virtue.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. EMILIA, or the Happine&s;s of Retirement.</HEAD>
<P>AS I was conver&s;ing with Emilia, a few days pa&s;t, I a&s;ked her whether &s;he was content|ed to live &s;o remote from the re&s;ort of company. She an&s;wered in the affirmative, and remarked further, that her &s;ituation enabled her to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between <HI>real</HI> friends and <HI>complimentary;</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="019364_0083_0FAB4BCF9F9BE758">
for if &s;he lived in a more public place, &s;he might be vi&s;ited by crouds of people, who were civil in|deed, but had no motive for calling on them, but to &s;pend an idle hour and gaze at the bu&s;y multitude.</P>
<P N="2">2. I was plea&s;ed with the remark, and was na|turally led to con&s;ider &s;uch a retired &s;ituation as a fortunate circum&s;tance for a young Lady of delicacy. Not only the happine&s;s of a family, but the character of young women, both in a mo|ral and &s;ocial view, depends on a choice of pro|per company. But this is not all. The frequen|cy of company, e&s;pecially if it furni&s;hes a variety of new objects, has a pernicious effect on the di&s;|po&s;itions of female minds.</P>
<P N="3">3. Women are de&s;tined by nature to pre&s;ide over dome&s;tic affairs. Whatever parade they may make abroad, their <HI>real</HI> merit and <HI>real</HI> char|acters are known only at home. The behaviour of &s;ervants, the neatne&s;s of furniture, the order of a table and the regularity of dome&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s, are the deci&s;ive evidences of female worth. Per|haps &s;weetne&s;s of temper does not contribute more to the happine&s;s of their partners and their families, than a proper attention to the&s;e articles.</P>
<P N="4">4. For this rea&s;on, whatever has a tendency to divert the mind from the&s;e concerns and give them a turn for empty &s;how, endle&s;s noi&s;e, and ta&s;tele&s;s amu&s;ements, ought to be carefully avoid|ed by young Ladies, who wi&s;h for re&s;pect beyond the pre&s;ent moment. Mi&s;&s;es, who are perpetu|ally &s;urrounded with idle company, or even live in &s;ight of it, though they may be fortunate e|nough to pre&s;erve their innocence, are &s;till in
<PB N="86" REF="019364_0084_0FAB4BD06D4D2718">
hazard of contracting &s;uch a fondne&s;s for di&s;&s;ipa|tion and folly, as to unfit them for the &s;uperin|tendance of a family.</P>
<P N="5">5. Such women, if they ever marry, mu&s;t be unhappy them&s;elves, or render their families &s;o. To indulge their former ta&s;te for plea&s;ure, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily neglect the duties of their &s;tation, and leave their families without a mi&s;tre&s;s; or if they attempt to di&s;charge tho&s;e duties, it mu&s;t be at the expen&s;e of their prevailing de&s;ires&mdash;a &s;acrifice that mu&s;t produce at le&s;t a temporary di&s;quietude in their own minds.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another danger to which young women, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of per&s;onal charms, are expo&s;ed in pub|lic places, is the flattery and admiration of men. The good opinion of a fop will hardly flatter a woman of di&s;cernment; much le&s;s their ordinary compliments which are commonly without mean|ing. But the heart is often &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, that it is difficult at fir&s;t to di&s;tingui&s;h between a cox|comb and man of worth; or if it is ea&s;y for an accurate ob&s;erver, yet there is great danger that vanity and inexperience will make young Ladies overlook the di&s;tinction.</P>
<P N="7">7. Few minds are effectually &s;ecured again&s;t the attacks of flattery. It is a poi&s;on the more fatal, as it &s;eizes human nature in its weake&s;t part. In youth, when the pa&s;&s;ions are in full vi|gour and the judgement feeble, female minds are peculiarly liable to be corrupted by the conta|gious influence of pretty civilities and affected ad|miration.</P>
<P N="8">8. With whatever &s;cruples they may at fir&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="019364_0085_0FAB4BDDCD654688">
li&s;ten to the prai&s;es that are be&s;towed on their real or pretended charms, a con&s;tant &s;train of flatter|ing addre&s;&s;es, accompanied with ob&s;equious com|plai&s;ance, &s;eldom fails of giving them too high an opinion of them&s;elves. They are in&s;en&s;ibly led to believe that they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtues to which they are really &s;trangers. This belief &s;a|tisfies them without attempting any further im|provement, and makes them to depend, for repu|tation in life, on good qualities, the fancied ex|i&s;tence of which begins and ends with the fal&s;e|hood of cu&s;tomary compliments.</P>
<P N="9">9. Such Ladies, before marriage, are u&s;ually vain, pert, affected and &s;illy; and after marriage, haughty di&s;appointed and peevi&s;h. The mo&s;t perfect beauty mu&s;t fade, and cea&s;e to command admiration; but in mo&s;t in&s;tances, the nuptial hour puts a period to that exce&s;s of flattering at|tention, which is the happine&s;s of giddy females. The longe&s;t term of admiration mu&s;t be &s;hort; that which depends &s;olely on per&s;onal attractions, is often momentary.</P>
<P N="10">10. The more flattery is be&s;towed upon young Ladies, the le&s;s, in general, are they &s;olicitous to acquire virtues which &s;hall en&s;ure re&s;pect when admiration &s;hall cea&s;e. The more they are prai&s;|ed in youth, the more they expect it in advanced life, when they have le&s;s charms to command it. Thus the exce&s;&s;ive complai&s;ance of admirers, which is extremely plea&s;ing at <HI>&s;ixteen,</HI> proves at <HI>forty,</HI> a &s;ource of mortification and di&s;content.</P>
<P N="11">11. I would by no means in&s;inuate that young Ladies ought to be kept total &s;trangers to com|pany
<PB N="88" REF="019364_0086_0FAB4BDDDB981258">
and to rational profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem. It is in company only that they can acquaint them&s;eves with mankind, acquire an ea&s;y addre&s;s, and learn numberle&s;s little decor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ms which are e&s;&s;ential and cannot be taught by precept. Without the&s;e, a woman will &s;ometimes deviate from that dig|nity and propriety of conduct, which, in any &s;itu|ation will &s;ecure the good-will of her friends, and prevent the blu&s;hes of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P N="12">12. A fondne&s;s for company and amu&s;ement is blameable only when it is indulged to exce&s;s, and permitted to ab&s;orb more important concerns. Nor is &s;ome degree of flattery always dangerous or u&s;ele&s;s. The good opinion of mankind we are all de&s;irous to obtain; and to know that we po&s;&s;e&s;s it, often makes us ambitious to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>No pa&s;&s;ion is given to us in vain; the be&s;t ends are &s;ometimes effected by the wor&s;t means; and even female vanity, properly managed, may prompt to the mo&s;t meritorious actions.</P>
<P N="13">13. I &s;hould pay Emilia but a very ill com|pliment to a&s;cribe her virtues to her local &s;itua|tion; for no per&s;on can claim as a virtue what &s;he has been in no danger of lo&s;ing. But there is no retirement beyond the reach of temptation, and the whole tenor of her conduct proves that her unblemi&s;hed morals and uniform delicacy proceed from better principles than nece&s;&s;ity or accident.</P>
<P N="14">14. She is loved and flattered, but &s;he is not vain; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> company is univer&s;ally coveted, and yet &s;he has no airs of haughtine&s;s and di&s;dain. Her cheerfulne&s;s in company &s;hews that &s;he has

a reli&s;h for &s;ociety; her contentment at home and attention to dome&s;tic concerns, are early &s;pe|cimens of her happy di&s;po&s;ition; and her decent unaffected abhorrence of every &s;pecies of licenti|ous behaviour, evinces, beyond &s;u&s;picion, that the innocence of her heart is equal to the charms of her per&s;on.</P>

<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Character of JULIANA.</HEAD>
<P>JULIANA is one of tho&s;e rare women who&s;e per&s;onal attractions have no rivals, but the &s;weetne&s;s of her temper and the delicacy of her &s;entiments. An elegant per&s;on, regular features, a fine complexion, a lively expre&s;&s;ive counte|nance, an ea&s;y addre&s;s, and tho&s;e blu&s;hes of mo|de&s;ty that &s;often the &s;oul of the beholder; the&s;e are her native beauties, which render her the ob|ject of univer&s;al admiration. But when we con|ver&s;e with her, and hear the melting expre&s;&s;ions of unaffected &s;en&s;ibility and virtue that flow from her tongue, her per&s;onal charms receive new lu&s;tre, and irre&s;i&s;tibly engage the affections of her acquaintances.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sen&s;ible that the great &s;ource of all happi|ne&s;s, is purity of morals and an ea&s;y con&s;cience, Juliana pays con&s;tant and &s;incere attention to the duties of religion. She abhors the infamous, but fa&s;hionable vice of deriding the &s;acred in&s;tituti|ons of religion. She con&s;iders a Lady without virtue as a mon&s;ter on earth; and every accom|pli&s;hment.
<PB N="90" REF="019364_0088_0FAB4BDF5B05D4D8">
without morals, as polite deception. She is neither a hypocrite nor an enthu&s;ia&s;t; on the contrary, &s;he mingles &s;uch cheerfulne&s;s with the religious duties of life, that even her piety carries with it a charm, which in&s;en&s;ibly allures the profligate from the arms of vice.</P>
<P N="3">3. Not only the general tenor of her life, but in particular her behaviour at church, evinces the reality of her religion. She e&s;teems it not only criminal in a high degree, but extremely unpo|lite, to behave with levity in a place con|&s;ecrated to the &s;olemn purpo&s;es of devotion. She cannot believe that any per&s;on, who is &s;oli|citous to treat all mankind with civility, can laugh in the temple of Jehovah and treat her great benefactor with heedle&s;s neglect.</P>
<P N="4">4. In polite life, the manners of Juliana are peculiarly engaging. To her &s;uperiors, &s;he &s;hows the utmo&s;t defference and re&s;pect; to her equals, the mo&s;t mode&s;t complai&s;ance and civility; while her in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">iors of every rank, experience her kind|ne&s;s and affability. By this conduct &s;he &s;ecures the love and friend&s;hip of all degrees. No per|&s;on can de&s;pi&s;e her, for &s;he does nothing that is re|diculous; &s;he cannot be hated, for &s;he does in|jury to none; and even the malevolent whi&s;pers of envy are &s;ilenced by her mode&s;t deportment and generous conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="5">5. Her conver&s;ation is lively and &s;entimental; free from fal&s;e wit, frivolous minutene&s;s, and af|fectation of learning. Although her di&s;cour&s;e is always under the direction of prudence, yet it appears un&s;tudied; for her good &s;en&s;e always
<PB N="91" REF="019364_0089_0FAB4BE014C352A8">
furni&s;hes her with thoughts &s;uited to the &s;ubject, and the purity of her mind renders any caution in expre&s;&s;ing them almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary. She will not lead the conver&s;ation; much le&s;s can &s;he &s;tun the ears of company with perpetual chat or interrupt the di&s;cour&s;e of others. But when occa|&s;ion offers, &s;he acquits her&s;elf with ea&s;e and grace; without the airs of pertne&s;s or the confu&s;ion of ba&s;hfulne&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. But if the conver&s;ation happens to turn upon the foibles of either &s;ex, Juliana di&s;co|vers her goodne&s;s by her &s;ilence or by inventing palliations. She dete&s;ts every &s;pecies of &s;lander. She is &s;en&s;ible that to publi&s;h and aggravate human errors, is not the way to correct them; and ref|ormation, rather than infamy, is the wi&s;h and the &s;tudy of her life. Her own amiable example is the &s;evere&s;t of all &s;atires upon the faults and the follies of her &s;ex, and goes farther in di&s;counte|nancing both, than all the cen&s;ures of malicious detraction.</P>
<P N="7">7. Altho' Juliana po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es every accompli&s;h|ment that can command e&s;teem and admiration; yet &s;he has neither vanity nor o&s;tentation. Her merit is ea&s;ily di&s;covered without &s;how and pa|rade. She con&s;iders, that haughtine&s;s and con|tempt of others, always proceed from meanne&s;s; that true greatne&s;s is ever acce&s;&s;ible; and that &s;elf recommendation and blu&s;tering preten&s;ions, are but the glittering decorations of empty heads and trifling hearts.</P>
<P N="8">8. However &s;trong may be her de&s;ire of u&s;e|ful information or however lively her curio&s;i|ty,
<PB N="92" REF="019364_0090_0FAB4BE0D6C331B8">
yet &s;he re&s;trains the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions within the bounds of prudence and good breeding. She deems it impertinent to the highe&s;t degree, to be prying into the concerns of other people; much more impertinent and criminal does &s;he deem it, to indulge an officious inqui&s;itivene&s;s, for the &s;ake of gratifying private &s;pleen in the propagati|on of unfavourable truths. So exceedingly deli|cate is &s;he in her treatment of her fellow creatures, that &s;he will not read a paper or hear a whi&s;per, which a per&s;on does not wi&s;h to have known, even when &s;he is in no danger of detection.</P>
<P N="9">9. The &s;ame delicate attention to the feelings of others regulates her conduct in company. She would not, for the price of her reputation, be found laughing or whi&s;pering with one in the company. All nods, grimaces, fly looks and half &s;peeches, the cau&s;e of which is not known, are carefully avoided by her and reprobated as the height of ill breeding and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in&s;ult to the company. Whenever this happens be|tween two per&s;ons, the re&s;t of the company have a ju&s;t right to con&s;ider them&s;elves the object of their ridicule. But it is a maxim of Juliana, that &s;uch conduct is a breach of politene&s;s, which, no oddities or mi&s;takes that happen in public com|pany, can excu&s;e or palliate.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is very common for per&s;ons, who are de&s;titute of certain accompli&s;hments which they admire in other people, to endeavour to imitate them. This is the &s;ource of affectation, a fault that infallibly expo&s;es a per&s;on to ridicule. But
<PB N="93" REF="019364_0091_0FAB4BEFCE575F18">
the ornaments of the heart, the dre&s;s and the man|ners of Juliana, are equally ea&s;y and natural. She needs not to a&s;&s;ume the <HI>appearance</HI> of good qua|lities which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in <HI>reality;</HI> nature has given too many beauties to her per&s;on, to require the &s;tudied embelli&s;hments of fa&s;hion; and &s;uch are the ea&s;e and gracefulne&s;s of her behaviour, that any attempt to improve them would le&s;&s;en the dignity of her manners.</P>
<P N="11">11. She is equally a &s;tranger to that &s;uperci|lious importance which affects to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;mall, but nece&s;&s;ary concerns of life; and that &s;queami&s;h fal&s;e delicacy which is wounded with every trifle. She will not neglect a &s;ervant in &s;ickne&s;s becau&s;e of the meanne&s;s of his employment; &s;he will not abu&s;e an animal for her own plea&s;ure and amu&s;e|ment; nor will &s;he go into fits at the di&s;tre&s;s of a favourite cat.</P>
<P N="12">12 Her gentle &s;oul is never di&s;turbed with di&s;|content, envy or re&s;entment; tho&s;e turbulent pa&s;&s;ions which &s;o often de&s;troy the peace of &s;oci|ety as well as of individuals.</P>
<P>The native firmne&s;s and &s;erenity of her mind for|bid the intru&s;ion of violent emotions; at the &s;ame time he heart, &s;u&s;ceptible and kind, is the &s;oft re&s;idence of every virtuous affection. She &s;u&s;tains the unavoidable &s;hocks of adver&s;ity, with a calmne&s;s that indicates the &s;uperiority of her &s;oul; and with the &s;mile of joy or the tear of tender|ne&s;s, &s;he participates the plea&s;ures or the &s;orrows of a friend.</P>
<P N="13">13. But the di&s;cretion and genero&s;ity of Julia|na, are particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the number
<PB N="94" REF="019364_0092_0FAB4BFC592921B0">
and &s;incerity of her attachments. Her friend&s;hips are few, but they are all founded on the princi|ples of benevolence and fidelity. Such confidence do her &s;incerity, her con&s;tancy and her faithful|ne&s;s in&s;pire, that her friends commit to her brea&s;t, their mo&s;t private concerns, without re&s;erve and without &s;u&s;picion. It is her favourite maxim, that a nece&s;&s;ity of exacting promi&s;es of &s;ecrecy, is a burle&s;que upon every preten&s;ion to friend&s;hip. Such is the character of the young, the amiable Juliana. If it is po&s;&s;ible for her to find a man who knows her worth and has a di&s;po&s;ition and virtues to reward it, the union of their hearts mu&s;t &s;ecure that unmingled felicity in life, which is re&s;erved for genuine love, a pa&s;&s;ion in&s;pired by &s;en&s;ibility and improved by a perpetual inter|cour&s;e of kind offices.</P>

<P>In almo&s;t every age, in repeated conflicts, and long and bloody wars, as well civil as foreign, again&s;t many and powerful nations, again&s;t the open a&s;&s;aults of enemies, and the more dangerous treachery of friends, have the inhabitants of your i&s;land, your great and glorious ance&s;tors, main|tained their independence and tran&s;mitted the rights of men and the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty to you their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Be not &s;urprized therefore, that we, who are de|&s;cended from the &s;ame common ance&s;tors, that we, who&s;e forefathers participated in all the rights, the liberties and the con&s;titution you &s;o ju&s;tly boa&s;t, and who have carefully conveyed the &s;ame fair inheritance to us, guarantied by the plighted faith of government, and the mo&s;t &s;olemn compacts with Briti&s;h Sovereigns, &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;urrender them to men, who found their claims on no prin|ciples of rea&s;on, and who pro&s;ecute them with a de&s;ign that by having <HI>our</HI> lives and property in ther power, they may with the greater facility en&s;lave <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The cau&s;e of America is now the object of univer&s;al attention: It is at length become very &s;erious. This unhappy country has not only
<PB N="155" REF="019364_0153_0FAB4A0EDA3C33A8">
been oppre&s;&s;ed, but abu&s;ed and mi&s;repre&s;ented; and the duty we owe to our&s;elves and po&s;terity, to your intere&s;t, and the general welfare of the Briti&s;h empire, leads us to addre&s;s you on this very important &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Know then,</HI> THAT we con&s;ider our&s;elves, and do in&s;i&s;t that we are and ought to be, as free as our fellow &s;ubjects in Britain, and that no power on earth has a right to take our property from us without our con&s;ent.</P>
<P>That we claim all the benefits &s;ecured to the &s;ubject by the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and particu|larly that ine&s;timable one of trial by jury.</P>
<P>That we hold it e&s;&s;ential to Engli&s;h liberty, that no man be condemned unheard, or puni&s;hed for &s;uppo&s;ed offences, without having an oppor|tunity to be heard in his defence.</P>
<P>That we think the legi&s;lature of Great-Britain is not authori&s;ed by the con&s;titution to e&s;tabli&s;h a religion, fraught with &s;anguinary and impious tenets, or, to erect an arbitrary form of govern|ment in any quarter of the globe. The&s;e rights, we, as well as you, deem &s;acred. And yet, &s;acred as they are, they have, with many others been re|peatedly and flagrantly violated.</P>
<P>Are not the proprietors of the &s;oil of Great-Britain lords of their own property? Can it be taken from them without their con&s;ent? Will they yield it to the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of any man, or num|ber of men whatever?&mdash;You know they will not.</P>
<P>Why then are the proprietors of the &s;oil of America, le&s;s lords of their property than you are of your's? or why &s;hould they &s;ubmit it to the di&s;|po&s;al
<PB N="156" REF="019364_0154_0FAB4A1185CCB9D8">
of your parliament, or any other parliament or council in the world, not of their election? Can the intervention of the &s;ea that divides us, cau&s;e di&s;parity in rights, or can any rea&s;on be given, why Engli&s;h &s;ubjects who live three thou&s;and miles from the royal palace, &s;hould enjoy le&s;s li|berty than tho&s;e who are three hundred miles di&s;|tant from it?</P>
<P>Rea&s;on looks with indignation on &s;uch di&s;tinc|tions, and freemen can never perceive their pro|priety. And yet however chimerical and unju&s;t &s;uch di&s;criminations are, the parliament a&s;&s;ert that they have a right to bind us in all ca&s;es without exception, whether we con&s;ent or not; that they may take end u&s;e our property when and in what manner they plea&s;e; that we are pen&s;ioners on their bounty for all that we po&s;&s;e&s;s, and can hold it no longer than they vouch&s;afe to permit. Such declarations we con&s;ider as heri&s;ies in En|gli&s;h politics, and which can no more operate to deprive us of our property, than the interdicts of the Pope can dive&s;t Kings of &s;ceptres, which the laws of the land and the voice of the people have placed in their hands.</P>
<P N="3">3. At the conclu&s;ion of the late war&mdash;a war ren|dered glorious by the abilities and integrity of a mini&s;ter, to who&s;e efforts the Briti&s;h empire owes its &s;afety and its fame:&mdash;At the conclu&s;ion of this war, which was &s;ucceeded by an inglorious peace, formed under the au&s;pices of a mini&s;ter, of prin|ciples, and of a family unfriendly to the prote&s;tant cau&s;e, and inimical to liberty&mdash;We &s;ay, at this period, and under the influence of that man, a
<PB N="157" REF="019364_0155_0FAB4A12176359B8">
plan for en&s;laving your fellow &s;ubjects in Ameri|ca was concerted, and has ever &s;ince been pertina|ciou&s;ly carrying into execution.</P>
<P>Prior to this aera, you were content with draw|ing from us the wealth produced by our com|merce. You re&s;trained our trade in every way that could conduce to your emolument. You exerci&s;ed unbounded &s;overeignty over the &s;ea. You named the ports and nations to which alone our merchandize &s;hould be carried, and with whom alone we &s;hould trade; and though &s;ome of the&s;e re&s;trictions were grievous, we neverthele&s;s did not complain; we looked up to you as to our pa|rent &s;tate, to which we were bound by the &s;trong|est ties; and were happy in being in&s;trumental to your pro&s;perity and your grandeur.</P>
<P>We call upon you your&s;elves, to witne&s;s our loyalty and attachment to the common intere&s;t of the whole empire: Did we not, in the la&s;t war, add all the &s;trength of this va&s;t continent to the force which repelled our common enemy? Did we not leave our native &s;hores, and meet di&s;ea&s;e and death, to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms in foreign climes? Did you not thank us for our zeal, and even re-imbur&s;e us large &s;ums of mo|ney, which, you confe&s;&s;ed, we had advanced be|yond our proportion, and far beyond our abili|ties? You did.</P>
<P>To what cau&s;es then, are we to attribute the &s;udden change of treatment, and that &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery which was prepared for us at the re&s;torati|on of peace?</P>

They are lavi&s;h|ly &s;quandered on court favourites, and mini&s;terial dependants generally avowed enemies to Ame|rica, and employing them&s;elves, by partial repre|&s;entations, to traduce and embroil the colonies.</P>
<P N="5">5. For the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of government here, we ever were and ever &s;hall be ready to provide.

To enforce this uncon&s;titutional and unju&s;t &s;cheme of taxation, every fence that the wi&s;dom of our Briti&s;h ance&s;tors had carefully erected again&s;t arbitrary power, has been violent|ly thrown down in America, and the ine&s;timable right of trial by jury taken away, in ca&s;es that touch both life and property&mdash;It was ordained,

that whenever offences &s;hould be committed in the colonies again&s;t particular acts impo&s;ing va|rious duties and re&s;trictions upon trade, the pro|&s;ecutor might bring his action for the penalties in the Courts of Admiralty; by which means the &s;ubject lo&s;t the advantage of being tried by an hone&s;t uninfluenced jury of the vicinage, and was &s;ubjected to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of being judged by a &s;ingle man, a creature of the Crown, and accor|ding to the cour&s;e of a law, which exempts the pro&s;ecutor from the trouble of proving his ac|cu&s;ation, and obliges the defendant either to e|vince his innocence or to &s;uffer. To give this new Judicatory the greater importance, and as, if with de&s;ign to protect fal&s;e accu&s;ors, it is fur|ther provided, that the Judge's certificate of their having been probable cau&s;es of &s;eizure and pro|&s;ecution, &s;hall protect the pro&s;ecutor from acti|ons at common law, for recovery of damages.</P>
<P>By the cour&s;e of our law, offences committed in &s;uch of the Briti&s;h dominions in which courts are e&s;tabli&s;hed and ju&s;tice duly and regularly ad|mini&s;tered, &s;hall be there tried by jury of the vi|cinage.

<P N="7">7. It would be &s;ome con&s;olation to us, if the catalogue of American oppre&s;&s;ions ended here. It gives us pain to be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of reminding you, that under the confidence repo&s;|ed in the faith of government, pledged in a roy|al charter from a Briti&s;h Sovereign, the fore|fathers of the pre&s;ent inhabitants of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay, left their former habitations, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed that great, flouri&s;hing, and loyal colo|ny. Without incurring or being charged with a forfeiture of their rights, without being heard, without being tried, without law, and without ju&s;tice, by an act of Parliament, their charter is de&s;troyed, their liberties violated, their con&s;titu|tion and form of government changed: And all this upon no better pretence, than becau&s;e in one of their towns a tre&s;pa&s;s was committed on &s;ome merchandize, &s;aid to belong to one of the

<P>Nor are the&s;e the only capital grievances un|der which we labour.

<P>This was evidently the object of the act:&mdash;And in this view, being extremely dangerous to our liberty and quiet, we cannot forbear com|plaining of it, as ho&s;tile to Briti&s;h America&mdash;Super<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ded to the&s;e con&s;iderations, we cannot help deploring the unhappy condition to which it has reduced the many Engli&s;h &s;et|tlers, who, encouraged by the royal proclamation, promi&s;ing the enjoyment of all their rights, have purcha&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tates in that country.&mdash;They are now the &s;ubjects of an arbitrary government, de|prived of trial by jury, and when impri&s;oned cannot claim the benefit of the habeas corpus act, that great bulwark and palladium of Eng|li&s;h liberty:&mdash;Nor can we &s;uppre&s;s our a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that a Briti&s;h parliament &s;hould ever con|&s;ent to e&s;tabli&s;h, in that country, a religion that has deluged your i&s;land in blood, and di&s;per&s;ed impiety, bigotry, per&s;ecution, murder and rebel|lion through every part of the world.</P>

New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, the counties of Newca&s;tle, Kent and Su&s;&s;ex on De|laware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, and South-Carolina, deputed by the inhabitants of the &s;aid colonies, to repre&s;ent them in a Gene|ral Congre&s;s at Philadelphia, in the Province of Penn&s;ylvania, to con&s;ult together on the be&s;t methods to obtain redre&s;s of our afflicting griev|ances, having accordingly a&s;&s;embled and taken into our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration the &s;tate of public affairs on this continent, have thought proper to addre&s;s your province, as a member therein deeply intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>When the fortune of war, after a gallant and glorious re&s;i&s;tance, had incorporated you with the body of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, we rejoiced in the tru|ly valuable addition, both on our own and your account; expecting, as courage and genero&s;ity are naturally united, our brave enemies would become our hearty friends, and that the Divine Being would ble&s;s to you the di&s;pen&s;ations of his over-ruling providence, by &s;ecuring to you and your late&s;t po&s;terity the ine&s;timable advantages of a free Engli&s;h con&s;titution of government, which it is the privilege of all Engli&s;h &s;ubjects to enjoy.</P>
<P>The&s;e hopes were confirmed by the King's proclamation i&s;&s;ued in the year 1763, plighting the public faith for your full enjoyment of tho&s;e advantages.</P>

<P><PB N="167" REF="019364_0165_0FAB4A1F933C1280">
But &s;ince we have lived to &s;ee the unexpected time, when mini&s;ters of this flagitious temper have dared to violate the mo&s;t &s;acred compacts and obligations, and as you were educated under another form of government, have artfully been kept from di&s;covering the un&s;peakable worth of that form you are now undoubtedly entitl|ed to, we e&s;teem it our duty, for the weighty rea|&s;ons herein after mentioned, to explain to you &s;ome of its mo&s;t important branches.</P>
<P N="2">2. "In every human &s;ociety," &s;ays the celebrat|ed Marquis Beccaria, "there is an effort conti|nually tending to confer on one part the height of power and happine&s;s, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakne&s;s and mi&s;ery. The in|tent of good laws is to oppo&s;e this effort, and to diffu&s;e their influence univer&s;ally and equally."</P>
<P>Rulers, &s;timulated by this pernicious "effort," and &s;ubjects, animated by the ju&s;t "intent of oppo&s;ing good laws again&s;t it," have occa&s;ioned that va&s;t variety of events, that fill the hi&s;tories of &s;o many nations. All the&s;e hi&s;tories demon|&s;trate the truth of this &s;imple po&s;ition, that to live by the will of one man, or &s;et or men, is the production of mi&s;ery to all men.</P>
<P>On the &s;olid foundation of this principle, Eng|li&s;hmen reared up the fabric of their con&s;titution with &s;uch a &s;trength, as for ages to defy time, tyranny, treachery, internal and foreign wars: and, as an illu&s;trious author<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;quieu.</HI></NOTE> of your nation, hereafter mentioned, ob&s;erves, "They gave the
<PB N="168" REF="019364_0166_0FAB4A1F9FEE4548">
people of their colonies the form of their own government, and this government carrying pro&s;|perity along with it, they have grown great nations in the fore&s;ts they were &s;ent to inhabit."</P>
<P>In this form the fir&s;t grand right is, that of the people having a &s;hare in their own govern|ment, by their repre&s;entatives, cho&s;en by them|&s;elves, and in con&s;equence of being ruled by laws which they them&s;elves approve, not by edicts of men over whom they have no controul This is a bulwark &s;urrounding and defending their property, which by their hone&s;t cares and la|bours they have acquired, &s;o that no portion of it can be legally taken from them, but with their own full and free con&s;ent, when they in their judgement deem it ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary to give them for public &s;ervices, and preci&s;ely direct the ea&s;ie&s;t, cheape&s;t, and mo&s;t equal methods in which they &s;hall be collected.</P>
<P>The influence of this right extends &s;till farther. If money is wanted by rulers, who have in any manner oppre&s;&s;ed the people, they may retain it, until their grievances are redre&s;&s;ed; and thus peaceably procure relief, without tru&s;ting to de&s;|pi&s;ed petitions, or di&s;turbing the public tran|quility.</P>
<P N="3">3. The next great right is that of trial by jury. This provides, that neither life, liberty nor pro|perty can be taken from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, until twelve of his unexceptionable countrymen and peers of his vicinage, who from that neigbour|hood may rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to be acquaint|ed with his character, and the character of the
<PB N="169" REF="019364_0167_0FAB4A205B15C6E0">
witne&s;&s;es, upon a fair trial, and full enquiry face to face in open court, before us many people as choo&s;e to attend, &s;hall pa&s;s their &s;entence upon oath again&s;t him; an oath that cannot injure him, without injuring their own reputati|on, and probably their intere&s;t al&s;o; as the que&s;tion may turn on points that, in &s;ome degree, concern the general welfare; and if it does not, their verdict may form a prece|dent, that on a &s;imilar trial of their own, may militate again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Another right relates merely to the liberty of the per&s;on. If a &s;ubject is &s;eized and impri&s;oned, though by order of Go|vernment, he may, by virtue of this right, immediately obtain a writ, termed a Habeas Corpus, from a Judge, who&s;e &s;worn duty is to grant it, and thereupon to procure any illegal re&s;traint to be quickly enquired into and redre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>A fourth right is, that by holding lands by the tenure of ea&s;y rents, and not by rigorous and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;ervices, fre|quently forcing the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from their families and their bu&s;ine&s;s, to perform what ought to be done, in all well regulat|ed &s;tates, by men hired for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The la&s;t right we &s;hall mention regards the freedom of the pre&s;s. The importance of this con&s;i&s;ts, be&s;ides the ad|vancement of truth, &s;cience, morality, and arts in general, in its diffu&s;ion, of liberal &s;entiments on the admini&s;tration of Government, its ready communication of thoughts between &s;ubjects, and its con&s;equential promotion of union among them, whereby oppre&s;&s;ive officers are &s;hamed or intimidated into more honourable and ju&s;t modes of conducting affairs.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the invaluable rights, that form a con&s;iderable part of our mild &s;y&s;tem of government; that, &s;ending its e|quitable energy through all ranks and cla&s;&s;es of men, defends the poor from the rich, the weak from the powerful, the in|du&s;trious from the rapacious, the peaceable from the violent, the tenants from the lords, and all from their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P N="4">4. These are the rights, without which a people cannot be free and happy, and under the protecting and encouraging in|fluence of which, the&s;e Colonies have hitherto &s;o amazingly flouri&s;hed and increa&s;ed.

Is the "certainty and le|nity of the <HI>criminal</HI> law of England, and its benefits and ad|vantages," commended in the &s;aid &s;tatute, and &s;aid to "have been &s;en&s;ibly felt by you," &s;ecured to you and your de&s;cen|dants!

<P>Such is the precarious tenure of mere <HI>will,</HI> by which you hold your lives and religion. The crown and its Mini&s;ters are impowered, as far as they could be by Parliament, to e&s;|tabli&s;h even the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> it&s;elf among you.

No. The power of making laws for you is lodged in the Governor and Council, all of them dependant upon, and removeable at the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of a mini&s;ter.

<HEAD>EXTRACT from the AMERICAN CRISIS No. V. Addre&s;&s;ed to Sir WILLIAM HOWE, by THOMAS PAYNE, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>WHEN we take a &s;urvey of mankind, we can|not help cur&s;ing the wretch, who, to the un|avoidable mi&s;fortunes of nature &s;hall wilfully add the calamities of war. One would think there were evils enough in the world without &s;tudying to encrea&s;e them, and that life is &s;ufficiently &s;hort without &s;haking the &s;and that mea&s;ures it. The hi&s;tories of Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, are the hi&s;tories of human devils; a good man cannot think of their actions without abhorrence nor of their deaths without rejoicing. To &s;ee the bounties of heaven de&s;troyed, the beautiful face of nature laid wa&s;ts, and the choice&s;t works of creation and art tumbled into ruin, would fetch a cur&s;e from the &s;oul of piety it&s;elf. But in this country the aggravation is lengthened by a new combination of affecting circum&s;tances. Ame|rica was young, and compared with other coun|tries
<PB N="176" REF="019364_0174_0FAB4A2729035420">
was virtuous. None but a Herod of un|common malice would have made war upon in|fancy and innocence; and none but a people of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed fortitude dared, under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, have re&s;i&s;ted the tyranny. The natives, or their ance&s;tors, had fled from the for|mer oppre&s;&s;ions of England and with the indu&s;try of bees had changed a wilderne&s;s into a habita|ble world. To Britain they were indebted for nothing. The country was the gift of Heaven, and God alone is their Lord and Sovereign.</P>
<P>The time, Sir, will come when you, in a me|lancholy hour, &s;hall reckon up your mi&s;eries by your murders in America. Life, with you, be|gins to wear a clouded a&s;pect. The vi&s;ion of plea&s;urable delu&s;ion is wearing away, and chang|ing to the barren wild of age and &s;orrow. The poor reflection of having &s;erved your king will yield you no con&s;olation in your parting mo|ments. He will crumble to the &s;ame undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed a&s;hes with your&s;elf, and have &s;ins enough of his own to an&s;wer for.

<HEAD>FRAGMENT of an original Letter on the &s;lavery of the Negroes; written in the year 1776, by THOMAS DAY, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> (Lately publi&s;hed in London.)</HEAD>
<P>I am extremely fearful of expre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf ob|&s;curely upon &s;o ab&s;tract a &s;ubject, and mu&s;t therefore, though with the hazard of prolixity, attempt to place it in a different light.&mdash;If you ima|gine any number of the human &s;pecies a&s;&s;embled in &s;ome particular part of the globe, without any form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, it is evident, that the&s;e individuals may either live together in &s;uch a manner as to produce mu|tual comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or may be the cau&s;e of continual mi&s;ery to each other. No pro|po&s;ition in the mathematics can be inve&s;tigated with more preci&s;ion than the methods of conduct which have the&s;e contrary tendencies. Every di&s;|po&s;ition which inclines one man to a&s;&s;i&s;t another, or to avoid giving him offence, or doing him an injury, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contribute to the com|mon welfare; which would be perfect, were the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions cultivated in the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree. On the contrary, every di&s;po&s;ition which, either by fraud or violence, tends to interrupt the per&s;onal &s;ecurity of indivi|duals
<PB N="178" REF="019364_0176_0FAB4A28CCBBDB70">
or deprive them of tho&s;e things which they have acquired by their indu&s;try, is detrimental to the &s;um of happine&s;s, and would, if carried to the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, entirely de&s;troy that part of the &s;pecies.&mdash;In this view of things, morality ari&s;es from nece&s;&s;ity, and comprehends "certain rules of conduct founded upon the relations which beings endowed with particular faculties bear to each other; which rules, when properly ob&s;erved, produce happine&s;s to &s;ociety; but when violated or neglected, as nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ion mi&s;ery, as fire or pointed &s;ub&s;tances excite pain, when they act too forcibly upon the nerves."</P>
<P>I hardly think that the greate&s;t &s;keptic will deny the&s;e di&s;tinctions, founded upon facts as certain as the impre&s;&s;ion of any material &s;ub&s;tance upon our &s;en&s;es. If we now proceed a little farther, we &s;hall find that the di&s;po&s;itions, which produce the&s;e different kinds of conduct, are, by the morali&s;ts, ex|pre&s;&s;ed by different names, and enforced by differ|ent motives, according to their &s;everal &s;ystems; while natural religion adds its &s;anctions, and in|clines us to believe that the Deity him&s;elf, who has di&s;played &s;o great an attention to the happi|ne&s;s and pre&s;ervation of his creatures here, may extend his benevolence to another &s;tage of exi&s;tence and compen&s;ate the evil &s;ometimes unmeritedly &s;uffered below. But if we admit the evidence of revealed religion, the &s;cheme of human things is perfect as it is augu&s;t; the clouds which over&s;ha|dowed our horizon are di&s;&s;ipated, and the gradual progre&s;s of triumphant virtue, through dangers and difficulties, to eternal happine&s;s, is di&s;played and a&s;certained.</P>

2. Having laid down the&s;e principles, it is ea&s;y to apply them to the particular ca&s;e in que&s;tion. Slave|ry is the ab&s;olute dependance of one man upon another; and is, therefore, as incon&s;i&s;tent with all ideas of ju&s;tice as de&s;poti&s;m is with the rights of nature. It is a crime &s;o mon&s;trous again&s;t the hu|man &s;pecies, that all tho&s;e that practi&s;e it de&s;erve to be extirpated from the earth. It is no little, indirect attack upon the &s;afety and happine&s;s of our fellow creatures, but one that boldly &s;trikes at the foundation of all humanity and ju&s;tice. Rob|bers invade the property, and murderers, the life of human beings; but he that holds another man in bondage, &s;ubjects the whole &s;um of his exi&s;t|ence to oppre&s;&s;ion, bereaves him of every hope, and is, therefore, more dete&s;table than a robber and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in combined. But if no one who has com|mon feeling will commit the outrage, no one who has common &s;en&s;e will attempt to ju&s;tify it by ar|gument; &s;ince it would involve him in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t inextricable contradictions. He mu&s;t al|low that every man has, by nature, a right to live, yet that every other man has a right to rob him of it; that every man has an equal right to &s;ub&s;i&s;|tance, yet that every other may deprive him of all the means; and that while every individual is ju&s;tified by nature and the Deity, in pur&s;uing his own happine&s;s by all innocent methods, every o|ther individual is equally ju&s;tified in making him mi&s;erable. In &s;hort, it is reducing every thing to the &s;tate before de&s;cribed, from which right and ju&s;tice are equally excluded.</P>
<P>Of you, &s;ir, who &s;ay you have &s;everal &s;laves, I beg leave to a&s;k what are the rights you claim
<PB N="180" REF="019364_0178_0FAB4A2A164216F0">
over them? Is your power circum&s;cribed by no bounds, and are there particular beings who bring into the world all the rights which you your&s;elf can pretend to, but have &s;o entirely lo&s;t them by being tran&s;ported into another country, as to be beyond the protection both of nature and nature's God?</P>
<P>Surely, &s;ir, unle&s;s I am deceived in you, you are a man both of honour and humanity. You &s;tart at the idea of wanton and unprovoked barbarity. You would not murder a &s;lave to &s;hew your dex|terity, nor maim him to prove your &s;trength; you would not da&s;h an in&s;ant upon the ground to &s;eed your dogs, even tho' he were black; nor would you rip up the belly of his mother while &s;he was &s;uck|ling him, to improve your &s;kill in anatomy. You neither would, nor <HI>dare</HI> you commit actions like the&s;e; you feel that you have no right to do them; or, if you have, that every other man has an equal and &s;uperior right to de&s;troy you like a bea&s;t of prey. What then are your rights? I anticipate your an&s;wer: You will feed and clothe your Ne|groes, you will treat them with humanity and ten|derne&s;s, and then you have a right to a moderate advantage from their labours. All this, &s;ir, is well; and could I conceive you had ever acted in another manner, I &s;hould never have troubled you with this tedious letter. While your negroes choo&s;e to &s;tay with you upon the&s;e terms, this is a fair and equitable compact. But what if they &s;hould choo&s;e to leave you, will you let them go? if you do, you are a man of honor, &s;en&s;e, and hu|manity; but I fear no We&s;t-Indian.</P>
<P>Are there no whips, no gibbets, no puni&s;h|ments more dreadful than death it&s;elf for contuma|cious
<PB N="181" REF="019364_0179_0FAB4A2ADBD23140">
&s;laves? And what is this but claiming the dete&s;table power I have mentioned above, that of making other beings mi&s;erable, for your intere&s;t or amu&s;ement? Who, Sir, gave you a title to their labours, or a right to confine them to loath&s;ome drudgery? and if you have no right to this, what are the puni&s;hments you pretend to inflict, but &s;o many additional outrages? Has a robber a claim upon your life becau&s;e you withhold your pro|perty; or a ravi&s;her to a woman's blood, becau&s;e &s;he defends her cha&s;tity!

If there is an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American pa|triot, &s;igning re&s;olutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other, brandi&s;hing a whip over his affrighted &s;laves.</P>
<P N="4">4. If men would be con&s;i&s;tent, they mu&s;t admit all the con&s;equences of their own principles; and you and your countrymen are reduced to the di|lemma of either acknowledging the rights of you
<PB N="184" REF="019364_0182_0FAB4A2E8AEC6AD0">
Negroes, or of &s;urrendering your own.&mdash;If there be certain natural and univer&s;al rights, as the de|clarations of your Congre&s;s &s;o repeatedly affirm, I wonder how the unfortunate Africans have in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">rred their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">feiture.&mdash;Is it the antiquity, or the virtues, or the great qualities of the Engli&s;h Ame|ricans, which con&s;titutes the difference, and en|titles them to rights from which they totally ex|clude more than a fourth part of the &s;pecies?&mdash;Or do you choo&s;e to make u&s;e of that argument, which the great Monte&s;quieu has thrown out as the &s;evere&s;t ridicule, that they are black and you white; that you have lank, long hair, while theirs is &s;hort and woolly?</P>
<P>The more attentively you con&s;ider this &s;ubject, the more clearly you will perceive, that every plea, which can be advanced upon it, is the plea of intere&s;t and tyranny combating humanity and truth. You cannot hide from your &s;elf, that every title you can alledge mu&s;t be a title founded upon fraud or violence, and &s;upported by open and a|vowed inju&s;tice, that a man who is born free can never forfeit his inheritance by &s;uffering op|pre&s;&s;ion; and that it is a contradiction to urge a purcha&s;e of what no one has a right to &s;ell? Nor does it make any difference whether the unfortu|nate victims pa&s;s from one to another, or from one to a thou&s;and ma&s;ters, any more than whether a nation be en&s;laved by a fir&s;t, or by hundredth ty|rant. There can be no pre&s;cription again&s;t truth and ju&s;tice; and the continuance of the evil is &s;o far from ju&s;tifying, that it is an exaggeration of the crime. What would you &s;ay to a man in private life, who &s;hould pretend to be no thief, becau&s;e he
<PB N="185" REF="019364_0183_0FAB4A2E97D3CEC8">
only bought &s;tolen goods; or that he was no vil|lain, becau&s;e he did not forge a deed him&s;elf, but only paid another to do it, and enjoyed the e&s;tate by that honourable &s;ecurity? Yet this is literally the title which the Americans plead to the unfortunate inhabitants of Africa. You do not go to Africa to buy or &s;teal your Negroes; perhaps, becau&s;e you are too lazy and luxurious: but you encou|rage an infamous pitile&s;s, race of men to do it for you, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly receive the fruits of their crimes. You do not, merciful men, reduce your fellow creatures to &s;ervitude! No, men of your independent &s;pirits, that have taken up arms a|gain&s;t the government that had protected and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed them, rather than pay a tax of three-pence; that have laid the axe to the root of all human au|thority, and in&s;tead of drinking the bitter waters of civil abu&s;es and pre&s;criptive obedience, have a&s;cended to the living fountains of truth, ju&s;tice and nature, would never make flagitious attempts upon the liberties and happine&s;s of their brethren! Yes, gentlemen, men of liberal minds like yours, acknowledge all mankind to be their equals.&mdash;Leave hereditary tyrants and their flatterers to make di&s;tinctions unknown to nature, and to de|grade one part of the &s;pecies to brutes, while they equal the other with gods!&mdash;You know that this is the greate&s;t of all corruptions, and as &s;uch you dete&s;t it.&mdash;What! are not all men naturally equal? And are not all civil di&s;tinctions, when legitimate, the permission of the people, and con&s;equently &s;ubordinate to their power and controul? Did you not carry the rights of men into the uncultivated de&s;ert and the howling wilderne&s;s? Not of
<PB N="186" REF="019364_0184_0FAB4A2F789ABCE8">
Frenchmen, nor of Germans, nor of Engli&s;h|men, but of men;&mdash;men, the fir&s;t and &s;upreme di&s;tinction, who, created for freedom and happi|ne&s;s, tran&s;port to every &s;oil the inherent preroga|tives of their nature.</P>
<P>Yes, gentlemen, as you are no longer Engli&s;h|men, I hope you will plea&s;e to be men; and, as &s;uch, admit the whole human &s;pecies to a participa|tion of your unalienable rights. You will not, therefore, drag a trembling wretch from his cot|age and his family; you will not tear the child from the arms of his frantic mother, that they may drag on a loath&s;ome exi&s;tence in mi&s;ery and chains; you will not make depredations upon your un|offending neighbours, and after having &s;pread de|&s;olation over a fertile country, reduce the innocent inhabitants to &s;ervitude. To do this, you mu&s;t be mon&s;ters, wor&s;e, I fear, than a majority of the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Engli&s;h Mini&s;try.&mdash;But you are men tremblingly alive to all the rights and feelings of the kind, and I believe &s;ome of you at le&s;t are Chri&s;tians. Your wor&s;t actions therefore, the greate&s;t crimes which even your e|nemies can object, are only that you are the voluntary cau&s;es of tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs?&mdash;You en|courage the Engli&s;h pirate to violate the laws of faith and ho&s;pitality, and &s;timulate him to new exce&s;&s;es by purcha&s;ing the fruits of his rapine&mdash;Your avarice is the torch of treachery and civil war, which de&s;olates the &s;hores of Africa and &s;hakes de&s;truction on half the maje&s;tic &s;pecies of man.</P>
