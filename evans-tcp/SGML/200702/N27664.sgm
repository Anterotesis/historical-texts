<HEAD>THE CONFESSION OF JOSEPH BAKER, (CANADIAN BY BIRTH.)</HEAD>
<P>Con&s;idering the awfulne&s;s of my &s;ituation, the dreadful tribunal before which I mu&s;t appear, there to give an account to a jealous and much-offended (but ju&s;t and merciful God) of all my vile and wicked crimes, committed at this early time of life, I deem it a duty I owe to captain Wheland, and to the community, in general, to give a clear and circum&s;tantial account of the horrid act, and of all the circum&s;tances leading thereto, &s;o that &s;uch of my fellow-men as follow the &s;eas, might take warning at my fate, and learn to fear God; to &s;hun &s;uch wicked prac|tices, and thereby avoid tho&s;e di&s;agreeable feelings which I have and am now &s;uffering, and the igno|minious and untimely end to which I mu&s;t &s;hort|ly be brought.</P>
<P>I was born in the year 1779, at Les-trois-riviers, in Canada, in a &s;treet called Forge-&s;treet. I was eighteen years old when I left my father, and went to Lake Champlain, from there I went to Virginia, on Lake Champlain, being &s;ixty miles from the line of Canada: In June, 1799, I work|ed my pa&s;&s;age in a boat from thence to Albany and New-York, where I went to work in company with another Canadian, at making &s;taves, and continued in that employment 8 days, at two dol|lars per day; to the other man, with whom I worked, I lent money to pay for his lodging, and gave the remainder of my money and clothes in
<PB N="3" REF="036873_0003_100B287DB0FC0230">
his charge, with all which he run off: I then went in the country to one colonel Robi&s;ts, twen|ty-one miles from New-York, and got from him a recommendation to obtain work at the &s;hip-car|penter's bu&s;ine&s;s. On my return to New-York, there I became acquainted with one Pierre Lewis Lacroix, (who is now under the unhappy &s;entence with my&s;elf, for the &s;ame crime.) One evening I went to a tavern in company with Lacroix; and, in conver&s;ation, he a&s;ked me where I lodged? I told him where my lodgings were, and the next day he (in company with Brous, now under the &s;ame &s;entence al&s;o) called upon me: they told me I was a fool to &s;tay in &s;uch a country as this was, when, if I would go the We&s;t-Indies and work at my trade, I could get five dollars per day. They told me of an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el at New-York, mount|ing eighteen guns, which was bound to Jamaica, with a cargo of flour and lumber. I went and entered on board of this ve&s;&s;el as &s;hip-carpenter. There were &s;even Italians and Frenchmen on board this ve&s;&s;el, who propo&s;ed to me to enter into a &s;ecret con&s;piracy for &s;uprizing the captain and crew on her voyage to the We&s;t-Indies, and make our&s;elves ma&s;ters of the &s;hip and cargo: But I would not agree to their propo&s;al, and, therefore, quitted the &s;hip; in con&s;equence of which, Pierre Lewis Lacroix and Jo&s;eph Brous, quitted her al&s;o. I came to Philadelphia on the twentieth of Augu&s;t, 1799, and took up lodgings at a board|ing hou&s;e in Water-&s;treet, in company with Pierre Lewis Lacroix: The before-mentioned Brous, having found out where we lodged, came and took lodgings in the &s;ame hou&s;e. As I did not like the company of Brous, I told Pierre Lewis Lacroix, to let us go, and look out for a ve&s;&s;el that was going to the We&s;t-Indies, and quit Brous. We found one captain Wheland who was bound to St. Thomas. I enquired of him if he wanted any hands: he told me he wanted two,
<PB N="4" REF="036873_0004_100B2881EA2BBEF0">
and &s;hipped Lacroix and my&s;elf at twenty-five dol|lars per month, Lacroix and my&s;elf then went to another part of the city to lodge, till the ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be ready to &s;ail; but, unfortunately, we meet with Brous in the &s;treet, and he a&s;ked me to lend him three dollars, for the purpo&s;e of pay|ing his board. I accordingly lent it to him, and told him I never wanted to &s;ee him any more. The next Monday morning Lacroix and my&s;elf went on board the ve&s;&s;el to &s;tay; and, to our great &s;urprize, we &s;aw Brous on board at work. I then a&s;ked him if he was &s;hipped with the ve&s;&s;el? he told me he was to work his pa&s;&s;age. We told him that this was not the way to go to the Havannah, as he &s;aid he meant to do. He told me he would find &s;ome ve&s;&s;el at St. Kitts that would be going to the Havannah. After which, the captain took him to the merchant to &s;ign articles to work his pa&s;&s;age. The merchant a&s;ked him what country|man he was: he told him he was an Italian. The merchant told him it was not true, for he was a Frenchman, and he had no pa&s;&s;age for him. After|wards the captain told him to go on board to work, and he would pay him for what he did: the captain that afternoon told him he would give him his pa&s;&s;age, although the merchant had re|fu&s;ed it. He accordingly went on board the ve&s;&s;el, and we &s;ailed from Philadelphia, bound to St. Thomas, on the 27th Augu&s;t, 1799. The 4th Sep|tember following, being at &s;ea, Brous a&s;ked me if I would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in taking the ve&s;&s;el. I told him I would not. After which, he put the &s;ame que&s;tion to Lacroix. He al&s;o told him he would have noth|ing to do with it; but he continually harra&s;&s;ed us for three days to con&s;ent to his wicked propo&s;al: Lacro&s;e then told him, that if he would take the ve&s;&s;el, he (Lacroix) would take her into port. He then a&s;ked me to take &s;ome poi&s;on out of the me|dicine-che&s;t, and put &s;ome in the &s;oup, for the pur|po&s;e of de&s;troying the captain, and the three other
<PB N="5" REF="036873_0005_100B28836E9C7308">
men. I told him that I had not &s;o hard an heart as to kill any man. I then a&s;ked him if he had a heart hard enough to kill a man? yes, &s;ays he, and if I had fifty of them tied hand and foot, I could kill them all, and my father at the head of them too. I told him that my heart was not &s;o hard as all that come to Brous then told me that he was an officer in the &s;ervice of the French Republic; and &s;aid, that if I did not con&s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t in taking the ve&s;&s;el, that the fir&s;t French crui&s;er they came up with, he would report me thereto, and have me &s;hot. I told him I was not a Frenchman, but was a Canadian. He told me that he would re|port me to be a Frenchman, and not a Canadian, and that general de Forneaux would take his word before he would mine. I told him that I would &s;ee that, and he &s;aid it was very well. I was in hopes every day that &s;ome American or Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el would come in &s;ight, as I intended to have reported to captain Wheland what Brous had &s;aid; but, unfortunately for us, we met with none. About two days after Brous and I had had the foregoing conver&s;ation, Brous again a&s;ked me (at about 10 o'clock at night) if I was ready to help him to take the ve&s;&s;el? I told him I would have no|thing to do with it. He then replied, "I will begin, and you mu&s;t take care of your&s;elf," and called me a coward. Next night, about ten o'clock, he cal|led me to light a candle. I, accordingly, was about doing &s;o, when the mate a&s;ked me where I was go|ing: I told him I was about lighting a candle for the binnacle, and when I brought up the candle, I found the mate lying dead on the companion. Brous had an axe in his hand, and Lacroix had a hand&s;pike in his, &s;tanding &s;ide by &s;ide. They told me to go down and take the captain's &s;word, and if he was a-&s;leep, to run it through his body, and if I did not do it, they would kill me: I went down, but I could not find it in my heart to kill the cap|tain, but &s;truck him on the hand with a hatchet:
<PB N="6" REF="036873_0006_100B28872D7BD450">
he then jumped up, and made a catch at me, and I then &s;truck him on the head. Immediately I ran up on deck: Brous then attempted to kill me, be|cau&s;e I had not killed the captain: I told him I had not the heart to kill him.</P>
<P>Lacroix &s;tood on the companion, with a hand|&s;pike in his hand, to kill the fir&s;t man that came up. The &s;upercargo came up, with a pi&s;tol in each hand, and Lacroix knocked him down with the hand&s;pike: Lacroix then told me to lower the peak of the chain-&s;ail; but, ju&s;t as I was going to do it, I ob&s;erved the &s;upercargo coming after me, with a pi&s;tol in each hand, to kill me. I then look|ed behind me, and &s;aw a &s;tick, which I picked up and &s;truck him with, and knocked him down. All this time the captain was below, and called out to La|croix. I a&s;ked what he wanted; he told me to &s;ave his life. Brous told the captain to come up; the captain &s;aid, "you will kill me if I do." I told him to &s;tay down, and &s;urrender him&s;elf a pri&s;oner of war. The captain then &s;aid he would. Lacroix then went down to bring up &s;ome liquor, and called me down to help to bring up the &s;upercargo on deck. Brous and my&s;elf went down and brought him up. We then laid him down till Lacroix brought &s;ome liquor to wa&s;h his wounds, but Brous &s;aid he would give him liquor enough; and immediately threw him overboard, though he was yet living. Brous told us to come along with him and kill the &s;ailor in the forca&s;tle: I told him I would not. Brous bid me go down to the &s;ailor. I accordingly did &s;o. the &s;ailor a&s;ked me if I wanted to kill him? I told him, that I did not, but that Brous did. He a&s;ked me where Brous was: I told him he was on deck, laying in wait to kill him: he then jumped on deck to catch Brous, but, before he could get to him, Brous &s;truck him with a hand&s;pike, and kil|led him. He then threw him overboard. We had now killed all but the captain, who con&s;idered him|&s;elf as a pri&s;oner of war. About four days after,
<PB N="7" REF="036873_0007_100B2888B4376E80">
Lacroix found a bottle of opium in the medicine|che&s;t; he told me to take care of it. I took it, and hid it: Brous came to me afterwards, and a&s;ked me where the bottle was? he &s;aid he wanted to give &s;ome to the captain to drink, &s;o as it might kill him: I told him I had lo&s;t it; but, a little time after, he found another bottle of the &s;ame kind, which he &s;aid he would keep him&s;elf, and give it to the cap|tain to drink, as &s;oon as we &s;aw a ve&s;&s;el heave in &s;ight; &s;o that he might &s;ay that all hands had died on board, except us three I told the captain of his danger, that Brous was determined to kill him the very fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el we &s;aw. The captain &s;aid he could not help it; but he would do the be&s;t he could to &s;ave him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The next day the captain told me he was &s;ick, and de&s;ired me to go and get &s;ome ham for him: La|croix and my&s;elf went down to get &s;ome for him, and when we went down, the captain took the axe and knocked Brous down. He then immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ocked down the foreca&s;tle, &s;o that we could not get up. Lacroix told me to a&s;&s;i&s;t him below, in cut|ting the ma&s;t down, &s;o that it might fall, and tear up the deck, that we might get out: I told him that I did not want to do &s;o, and, in con&s;equence of my refu&s;al, he abu&s;ed me very much, and &s;aid I was a coward. We were fourteen days in the hold before we got to St. Bartholomews, and, during that time, we lived upon flour and water, and &s;ome liquor. After we arrived at St. Bartholomews, the captain put us on board an American armed ve&s;&s;el, the lieu|tenant of which abu&s;ed us in a violent manner, and put ropes round our necks: we remained in this &s;ituation three days, and then we were taken to St. Kitts, where we were put in pri&s;on and kept in irons, on five ounces of bread and water per day for nine|teen days. We were then put on board the United States &s;loop of war Ganges, and were in irons eigh|teen days, &s;leeping on deck all the while. Brous and Lacroix told me to declare my&s;elf a French|man,
<PB N="8" REF="036873_0008_100B288BC38CAD18">
at the peril of my life. They al&s;o told me, if I would con&s;ent to this declaration, each of them would give me the 700 dollars; to which I con&s;ented. We arrived at Philadelphia on the 12th of Novem|ber, 1799, and were landed from on board the Ganges, conducted to pri&s;on under guard, and im|mediately lodged in the cells. 'Tis but ju&s;tice I owe to the in&s;pectors, and to every keeper about the pri&s;on, to &s;ay, that we have always been treated with every degree of humanity, and, in every re&s;|pect, as well as the nature of our &s;ituations could admit of, received full allowance, nor were we ever put in irons until after we received the fatal (tho' ju&s;t) condemnation of death, (and that by order of the court.)</P>
<P>And now, having fini&s;hed my narration, and the time approaching fa&s;t when I mu&s;t &s;uffer the ju&s;t reward due to the horrid crime in which I have been too great a participator, there remains no|thing move for me to add, but to declare that I die in the full belief of the Roman Catholic religion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that I have truly and &s;incerely repented of my ma|nifold &s;ins and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and, as I place a firm reliance on the mercies of Almighty God, I hum|bly be&s;eech him to manife&s;t his ble&s;&s;ed declaration upon me, and be to me "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, delaying indignation, and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth, keeping mercy for thou&s;ands, forgiving iniquity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in; that it may plea&s;e him to number me among&s;t tho&s;e thou&s;ands for whom he has declared he will keep mercy; and that, through the blood and me|rits of my ble&s;&s;ed redeemer, my &s;ins may be purged away, and my &s;oul admitted into the man&s;ions of eternal bli&s;s. AMEN.</P>
