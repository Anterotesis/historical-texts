<HEAD>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t celebrated writers of former a|ges have happily illu&s;trated and re|commended intere&s;ting and important truths by allegory, or fable; and by their agreeable manner in the figurative &s;tyle, have ever been highly acceptable. Through tho&s;e &s;ilvery channels, e&s;&s;ential truths have been propitiou&s;|ly conveyed, which were very unlikely to have been otherwi&s;e &s;o cordially entertained. As &s;uch a method of writing hath always prov|ed both plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive, it is highly probable it will be continued in practice thro' &s;ucceeding ages. The introduction of imag|inary beings hath, perhaps &s;ome degree of propriety in the &s;cenes pre&s;ented in the fol|lowing memoirs, which are laid in those re|gions where the mo&s;t &s;tupendous fabulous le|gends originated. If fable hath been hither|to &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed (as both &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory appear to evince) for the in&s;truction and entertainment of mankind;&mdash;if trees have been &s;ummoned to &s;peak; the floods to lift up their voice; and the various orders of inferior exi&s;tences, in language in|telligible, to rebuke and reform;&mdash;if a proph|et's madne&s;s hath been corrected by a moral le&s;&s;on from his in&s;ulted bea&s;t; the vicious and cruel reprehended and reclaimed by talking birds and &s;inging trees; why may not adole|&s;ence, or even riper years, be &s;till in like man|ner di&s;ciplined? Doth the mighty Hercules come forward, in ancient &s;tory, with his tre|mentous

club, to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of tho&s;e baleful mon&s;ters which di&s;turbed the peace of &s;ociety; why &s;hall not a Prince of China, in a later age, advance upon the theatre of the world, though with le&s;s formidable weapons than was that of the redoubtable hero;&mdash;with victorious eloquence and alluring manners to correct and reform the ra&s;h&punc; and untutored, and re&s;tore the haple&s;s wanderer to the paths of true virtue and honor, and con&s;equent fe|licity; and, having atchieved the mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous exploits, e&s;tabli&s;h a grand &s;ociety cement|ed by love? As then, the de&s;ign of fable is agreeably to convey the mo&s;t &s;alutary truths that they may be effectually impre&s;&s;ed upon the minds of tho&s;e readers who are apt to be di&s;gu&s;ted with dry treati&s;es of morality; let it &s;till be permitted to lend its benevolent aid for our entertainment and in&s;truction, till the expected aera fully arrives when genuine un|mixed truth &s;hall &s;hine forth with charms &s;u|perceding the nece&s;&s;ity of the fa&s;cinating blan|di&s;hments of fictitious tales. However, the works of imagination, when &s;ub&s;ervient to rea|&s;on and virtue, will never fail to be admired.</P>
<P>The Author of the &s;ub&s;equent Memoirs looks for no other commendation than that which is merited by an hone&s;t attempt to ad|vance, to the utmo&s;t of his &s;lender abilities, the real felicity of his country and mankind. He thinks of his talent at compo&s;ition as far be|low tho&s;e of the worthy and excellent writers of

His country may well boa&s;t the literary produc|tions of eminent e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts of both &s;exes: and, to the ri&s;ing generation, it is indeed a mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting circum&s;tance, that female literary merit hath pre&s;ented &s;o brilliant an addition to our national glory.&mdash;Happy talents, Con&s;tan|tia, are confe&s;&s;edly thine!

It is thou, too, who ha&s;t dignified thy &s;ex. To thee is it highly indebted for thy excel|lent vindication of its rights, a&s;certaining its importance, and celebrating its &s;hining vir|tues.

<P>IN that charming &s;ea&s;on of the year, when &s;mil|ing nature dre&s;&s;ed in all its loveline&s;s, pre&s;ents the mo&s;t enchanting &s;cenes;&mdash;the philo&s;ophic and contemplative Nytan, Prince of China, had retired with &s;everal &s;elect friends, who&s;e minds were con|genial with his own, that they might enjoy the lux|uries of &s;pring, in a delightful retreat he had form|ed a few miles from the metropolis. It was a re|ce&s;s romantically &s;ituated, almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed by rocky precipices and woods, and a very high wall extending to the &s;ea &s;hore. His building was con|&s;tructed in the mo&s;t elegant rural ta&s;te, containing a variety of beautiful and well furni&s;hed apartments. It was &s;ituated on a gradually ri&s;ing ground, pre|&s;enting from its windows the mo&s;t delightful and picture&s;que &s;cenes; not in the lea&s;t, incommoded by a number of trees nearly adjoining, which tow|ered gay and maje&s;tic, and who&s;e wide &s;preading branches, tempering the &s;un's meridian rays, waved over the lofty roofs. Among tho&s;e &s;elect friends were his amiable &s;i&s;ters, with each a friend of their own &s;ex, beautiful and highly accompli&s;hed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of congenial minds, exalted by nature, and refined by education. Here they enjoyed alternately the &s;ub|lime plea&s;ure of &s;ocial conver&s;e, &s;tudy, and contem|plation&mdash;&s;ometimes in delicious walks; at others,
<PB N="10" REF="038495_0009_10122C70F16CF440">
reclined in &s;ome cho&s;en &s;pot on the &s;oft and verdant turf; or viewing the diversified &s;cenes from an ele|vated rock amid the &s;portive lambs. All the plea&s;|ing variety of feathered &s;ong&s;ters &s;eemed to be here. collected on purpo&s;e to regale them with their &s;pright|ly and animated notes. Philo&s;ophic and elevated minds, like theirs, could not fail of enjoying the plea&s;ures of &s;o romantic and charming a rece&s;s with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite reli&s;h.</P>
<P>The Emperor and Empre&s;s &s;ometimes graced this lovely retreat with their pre&s;ence; which fail|ed not to yield an highly augmented addition to its plea&s;ures. Here their beloved and affectionate daughters were happy indeed. In the company of their fond brother, and two worthy Mandarins, his mo&s;t endeared friends, and who had gained the hearts of the two &s;i&s;ters by the mo&s;t tendere&s;t a&s;&s;iduities. They were nearly arrived to that age when every charm expands. Their minds formed with native genius and worth were greatly improved by &s;tudy and reflection, and every parental and fraternal attention. Happy lovers! &s;anctioned as &s;uch by the parents and relatives of each party, to enjoy, in this undi&s;turbed &s;eclusion from the cares of life, and the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, the &s;oothing, the enrapturing con|ver&s;e of the fair mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of their affections, to aid their &s;tudies in the various branches of litera|ture they were delightfully exploring! Sweetly glid|ed on the golden hours; and every &s;ucceeding &s;un aro&s;e to pre&s;ent them with new plea&s;ures! What matter of deep regret that &s;uch felicity &s;hould be interrupted by any adver&s;e occurrence! yet &s;uch was the appointed de&s;tiny. The Prince was &s;um|moned, one day, from this delicious retirement, to at|tend his father at court. He took leave of the little in|chanting a&s;&s;embly, with the promi&s;e of a &s;peedy re|turn. But it was a promi&s;e which Heaven had de|creed
<PB N="11" REF="038495_0010_10122C72857775B8">
&s;hould never be fulfilled. A long, an afflict|ing &s;eparation that moment commenced from the deare&s;t friends of his tender and affectionate heart. He had but lately returned from an important tour through the Empire; and had flattered himself with the &s;ublime&s;t enjoyments of the vernal &s;eason with tho&s;e friends, in a temporary &s;eclusion from the re&s;t of the world. The iniquitous cau&s;e of his being curtailed of tho&s;e enjoyments, and the &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucceeding events, I proceed to unfold.</P>
<P>RENIEN had reigned till this eventful period, one of the happie&s;t &s;overeigns that ever adorned the il|lu&s;trious throne of the va&s;t empire of China. Ble&s;&s;|ed in the love and e&s;teem of his &s;ubjects, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom and prudence, a tender and generous heart, his virtues diffu&s;ed &s;erenity and fe|licity every where around him. Through nations, far and near, his fame was celebrated for innumer|able great and good actions. The mi&s;eries of pov|erty and oppre&s;&s;ion were &s;carcely known, in China, in his propitious days:&mdash;Propitious tranquil and &s;erene,&mdash;till now&mdash;towards the clo&s;e of his life (for no earthly bli&s;s is alloted unexceptionably perfect;) when the &s;ecret ambitious and too &s;ucce&s;sful ma|chinations of Sanden one of his chief minsi&s;ters, be|gan to di&s;turb his repo&s;e, threatening the convul|&s;ion and di&s;organization of the Empire. The cha|racter and growing virtues of his only &s;on, Prince Nytan, were too much for the envious heart of that mini&s;ter to endure? who, however &s;pecious his ap|pearances, was an inveterate enemy to the good, and, it was by the profounde&s;t di&s;&s;imulation only, that he had maintained his place at court, or any degree of re&s;pect among mankind. He therefore employed every wicked art to fix an indelible &s;tain of the deep|e&s;t hue upon the reputation of the Prince,&mdash;to bla&s;t the faire&s;t character for loyalty, virtue and probity;
<PB N="12" REF="038495_0011_10122C7414186CA8">
and to effect a period to tho&s;e wi&s;e and benevolent &s;chemes for the public weal, in the forming and pro&s;ecution of which, the &s;on acted in concert with his royal parent. "If, &s;aid the plotting Sanden to him&s;elf, I can accompli&s;h the di&s;grace of the Prince and his adherents&mdash;if I can procure them to be ex|iled, if not de&s;troyed; as the Emperor is now in the decline of life, and numbers are oppo&s;ed to his virtues and political views, who will unite with me in the perfecting my de&s;igns; I &s;hall &s;oon be in a fair way of obtaining the &s;overeign power, and en|joying plea&s;ures uncontrouled." To accompli&s;h his black &s;cheme of villainy, whil&s;t the prince was ab&s;ent on his tour, (which was near fourteen months) he had &s;ecretly promoted an in&s;urrection in a di&s;|tant part of the empire, and had laid his plans &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, as to render it, an indubitable fact to millions, that the Prince was its chief promoter;&mdash;that he had per&s;uaded many of great influence to di&s;|affect the minds of the people towards the Emper|or, as imposed on by intriguing courtiers, who were aiming under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, at a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> rev|olution, This &s;cheme &s;o far &s;ucceeded that the Em|peror i&s;&s;ued orders to apprehend his &s;on: and his being &s;ent for to court was only a trick of Sanden's, to effect his confinement without alarming his faith|ful and powerful friends in the rece&s;s; who there waited, indeed, a long time, with the utmo&s;t im|patience, for his promi&s;ed return! Before he had reached Pekin, he was &s;eized by Sanden's &s;oldiers, and hurried away to an old ca&s;tle on the &s;ea coa&s;ts, amid&s;t craggy rocks, and gloomy woods; a place wholly at the di&s;po&s;al and command of that wicked mini&s;ter, as were its gloomy inhabitants of fiends and murderers. Such were the effects of the cai|tiff's calumnious lies.&mdash;Vile &s;landerer! Inhuman perpetrator of the foule&s;t mi&s;chief! Ingrateful mur|derer
<PB N="13" REF="038495_0012_10122C767AE32648">
of the pure&s;t fame, and betrayer of innocence the mo&s;t &s;potle&s;s and perfect! What dreadful pun|i&s;hment can atone for thy unparralelled outrage to virtue and friend&s;hip, loyalty and patrioti&s;m! A &s;landerer&mdash;an incendiary&mdash;a traitor and betrayer.&mdash;What character can be deemed more infamous, more pernicious than thine; the &s;landerer is indeed the wor&s;t of murderers. He over whelms the univer&s;e with mi&s;chiefs and deaths! He is an a&s;&s;a&s;s&s;in who &s;tabs in the dark; who de&s;troys his neighbour's peace and felicity by depriving him of his good name, of his affectionate friends, far dearer to him than life: and yet vile and pernicious as is the cha|racter of a &s;landerer, how many thou&s;ands are there, in regions called civilized, to whom it may be too ju&s;tly imputed; and in which the defamer is every where heard, and the tongues of mi&s;chief are per|petually fomenting di&s;cord in every family, in eve|ry &s;ociety. Are they the &s;ons of rea&s;on, are they reflecting beings, who, profe&s;&s;ing the greate&s;t of virtues, are guilty of the wor&s;t of vices, and&punc; like Sanden, with &s;pecious pretentions to real goodne&s;s, are undermining the friends of virtue, and the &s;av|iours of mankind, that vice, anarchy and ruin may reign triumphant! Ah! barbarous de&s;troyer of the peace and felicity of thy un&s;u&s;pecting friends! Such offences as thine are indeed of the blacke&s;t hue! but vengeance, ju&s;t vengeance pur&s;ues thee! dread darkne&s;s and dire de&s;pair are on the way to arre&s;t thee, and thy enormous crimes &s;hall affright and torture thy guilty &s;oul!</P>
<P>Too often does it happen that the wi&s;e are fatal|ly deceived&mdash;the wi&s;e the generous and the good&mdash;by the &s;pecious the in&s;idious friend. It is a le&s;|&s;on of momentous in&s;truction! It &s;hould rou&s;e us to be more effectually on our guard; and it &s;hould
<PB N="14" REF="038495_0013_10122C7927AB0F50">
likewi&s;e in&s;truct us to be more con&s;tantly dependent on the heavenly power. It is not in vain that we are &s;uffered to feel the cruel effects of deception, of fallacious friend&s;hip. They are de&s;igned to ren|der us more invariably &s;en&s;ible where our &s;afety lies, to attach us more firmly to the cele&s;tial, the all-powerful the unchangeable FRIEND.&mdash;O happy expected age of perfection! when the great and the wi&s;e &s;hall confide, unre&s;ervedly, in the &s;ource of wi&s;dom, and nations re&s;t on the Almighty arm!</P>
<P>The &s;olitary &s;ituation, of the Ca&s;tle in which the Prince was confined, was well adapted to the trai|tor's infamous de&s;ign. No habitations were adja|cent to it, only a few mi&s;erable huts of mi&s;erable inhabitants; and the frightful reports of its being occupied by evil &s;pirits, deterred the poor wretches, oppre&s;&s;ed as they were by Sanden (on who&s;e lands they but barely exi&s;ted) as well as many others, from invading its precincts, or advancing under its moul|dering walls. In this dreary building was the Prince immured, in a &s;mall paltry detached cham|ber, with a boy only to attend him. An oath was impo&s;ed on him not to &s;tir from his chamber but by &s;pecial leave from the Emperor, and not to at|tempt an e&s;cape from his pri&s;on. For his enemies were &s;en&s;ible that their &s;tronge&s;t guards, and wi&s;e&s;t precautions might po&s;&s;ibly be defeated. The boy, who was devoted to Sanden, and bribed very high, was to &s;leep with him for greater &s;ecurity. A guard, likewi&s;e, was &s;tationed, and &s;trongly intere&s;ted to prevent the pri&s;oner's re&s;cue, though his oath was &s;ufficient &s;ecurity, with whom it was truly &s;ac|red and inviolable, though impo&s;ed again&s;t rea|&s;on and humanity. Yet all the&s;e precautions failed to compo&s;e the fearful and guilty mind of Sanden A wicked magician had taught the mini&s;ter his en|chantments; by the power of which he imagined
<PB N="15" REF="038495_0014_10122C7B41B368D8">
he had rendered the ca&s;tle inacce&s;&s;ible to all but his depraved minions, and the Prince's confinement mo&s;t effectual again&s;t any art or &s;tratagems of his own. The Prince however, was far &s;uperior to him in magic &s;kill; though he di&s;dained the u&s;e of it to di&s;honorable purposes.&mdash;But thus it ever is with the wicked, guilty mind. Fearful and mi&s;|tru&s;tful, it calls in every aid, to impo&s;e on it&s;elf; adding guilt to guilt, crime to crime, outrage to out|rage; it enlarges the &s;tructure of its villainies; till the pondrous load, unable to &s;upport it&s;elf on its iniquitous ba&s;is falls, and cru&s;hes the builder in its ruin!&mdash;</P>
<P>[The hi&s;torians of <HI>Xuntien,</HI> who wrote Memoirs of <HI>Ravenzer,</HI> (the nation celebrated in the following books;) do indeed give a different account of the Prince's misfortune, and of the great events that followed it: One a&s;&s;erting that he was immediate|ly bani&s;hed to a de&s;olate i&s;land; where, finding a few men who had been &s;hipwrecked, he united with them and a great number of his countrymen who fol|lowed his fortune, in forming a government for them&s;elves.

Nothing is &s;aid of the wonder|ful magical operations, or of the Prince's inter|cour&s;e with a &s;uperior order of beings. It is only remarked, that the Prince, in his earlier years, was fa&s;cinated by the charms of <HI>occult &s;cience,</HI> and the conver&s;ation of magicians; but that he, after|wards, thought very differently of the&s;e men, and their art, which may be indeed a &s;tate of the matter neare&s;t to probability. <HI>Zerrinn</HI> a&s;&s;erts that the Prince held conver&s;e with, and was directed by Angels; and places the epoch of his exi&s;tence many ages

<P>&mdash;Thus he &s;eemed to be effectually &s;ecured in his little chamber; where, too, he was liable to &s;uffer on account of his health through the failure
<PB N="17" REF="038495_0016_10122C7F17C69BE0">
of proper exerci&s;e. Yet &s;uch was the wi&s;dom and &s;agacity of this young man, (for he had &s;carcely &s;een his nineteenth year) that he found means, without violating his oath, both to pre&s;erve his health, and to free him&s;elf from the power of his enemy. The learning and &s;cience he had acquired, were im|men&s;e for one of his years. As he grew up from infancy he di&s;covered a &s;urpri&s;ing genius. An in|dulgent parent had afforded him every advantage for the mo&s;t fini&s;hed education, that could be derived from the be&s;t in&s;tructors; and he &s;oon out&s;tripped his competitors in &s;tudy, making the mo&s;t rapid advances in all the branches of polite learning, and every accompli&s;hment that might render him ami|able, re&s;pectable and u&s;eful. Nature had formed him perfectly beautiful and graceful in his per&s;on. With an unaffected goodne&s;s of heart, he united the mo&s;t engaging and winning addre&s;s, which, with his benevolent actions, had endeared him to all ranks of men. It can therefore be no matter of wonder, that the news of his impri&s;onment, and the pretended occa&s;ion of it, awakened a&s;toni&s;hment and the &s;incere&s;t grief in every heart excepting that of the infamous author, and tho&s;e of the few a&s;&s;imilated to his vile character. His mo&s;t powerful friends, among which where tho&s;e who had, at length, re|turned to town from the rece&s;s, vehemently remon|&s;trated to the Emperor again&s;t &s;uch har&s;h treatment of his &s;on, but in vain. He an&s;wered them, that he had obtained &s;ome of his incendiary letters;
<PB N="18" REF="038495_0017_10122C812C939348">
(which were indeed the forgeries of Sanden,) and that he could at pre&s;ent act no otherwi&s;e than he had done. He however felt the mo&s;t poignant grief, (as well may be conceived on the account of a &s;on &s;o greatly beloved and admired by both his royal parents, as well as by every good citizen. The Empre&s;s his mother, his &s;i&s;ters, and his deare&s;t friends were incon&s;olable; but could prevail noth|ing in the Prince's favour. The affliction of the Empre&s;s was almo&s;t too much for her to &s;u&s;tain. A violent fever &s;eized her; and her life was &s;oon deemed to be in eminent danger. The friends of the Prince u&s;ed every means, in their power, to detect the con&s;piracies formed again&s;t him, and to di&s;per&s;e the &s;torm gathering over the Empire. But matters were &s;o managed by Sanden, and the powers he had engaged on his &s;ide, that they could accompli&s;h but little. Ereng and Yerrie the di&s;con&s;olate &s;i&s;ters, were ever urging them to exertions in behalf of their beloved brother; &s;o that they were at length, con&s;trained to amu&s;e them with flattering hopes but ill founded.</P>
<P>In the mean time Prince Nytan was patiently enduring his confinement and improving him&s;elf with a few rare and invaluable books, without which he never travelled far from his father's palace. They in&s;tructed him in &s;ecrets of nature but little known in the world; and &s;o va&s;t was his genius, that he had already made improvements in the arts by which wonders are performed, beyond the knowledge of the authors of tho&s;e books; the happy effects of which improvements will be evidenced from the &s;equel; from which it will appear how this won|derful man could appear abroad in di&s;tant countries, and accompli&s;h great and glorious things, and yet remain all the while in his little pri&s;on, doing al|mo&s;t every thing he plea&s;ed except embracing his
<PB N="19" REF="038495_0018_10122C841B2A21D0">
beloved parents, &s;i&s;ters and friends. Before he could enjoy that happine&s;s, he had great things to effect for the good of mankind; and &s;till greater were to &s;ucceed them.</P>
<P>He had purcha&s;ed, in his tour &s;everal little pic|tures, which he had fixed on the walls of his cham|ber, on each &s;ide his couch. One, neare&s;t his view, (which he had picked up from a miry place in the road,) he was very frequently looking at; &s;tudying certain figures of writing at the bottom of it, in|telligible only to him&s;elf and their author. We &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently the extraordinary &s;ervices this picture rendered him, of which he became exceed|ing fond, not without rea&s;on.</P>
<P>His chamber had but one large window, which afforded him, as he reclined on his couch a very ex|ten&s;ive and delightful pro&s;pect; and from which he beheld the reflected &s;plendors of a magnificent tow|er, and a number of beautiful buildings that ap|peared above the di&s;tant hills and groves. This pro&s;pect entertained him in his momentary relaxa|tions from his &s;tudies. Literary pur&s;uits were ever his chief plea&s;ure, as thereby he became more ca|pable of &s;erving mankind. To the&s;e his retirement was adapted, and he knew how to an&s;wer the calls of health for the exerci&s;es of walking, riding, and the charms of conver&s;ation, by a diet adapted to his &s;edentary circum&s;tances. He conver&s;ed with books, he &s;tudied and contemplated the glorious works of nature; but he did not forget the Great Source of Being, and the underived origin of all intellectual light. He conver&s;ed with the God of nature, and his great knowledge in the occult &s;cience, and the deep my&s;teries he had learned, were by him improv|ed for the good of mankind.&mdash;Unhappy fate! that a Prince &s;o worthy &s;hould be excluded from the world, after having been fal&s;ely and &s;landerously ac|cused

of &s;editious practices again&s;t his country, a|gain&s;t his Sovereign, and a parent too for whom he would have freely laid down his life! But &s;uch are often the events of this imperfect &s;tate of ex|i&s;tence. The good &s;uffer by the wicked. Yet let not the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Almighty be ar|raigned. For wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es are the vir|tuous defamed and pro&s;ecuted, virtue is tried, and fortitude, under trials, made illu&s;trious. Thus the good are refined for the enjoyment of higher plea|&s;ures, and more exalted bli&s;s. Of the&s;e important truths, Nytan was far from being in&s;en&s;ible; who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;oul, formed to receive every &s;acred impre&s;&s;ion, and &s;alutary in&s;truction. Now Ge&s;|&s;eng &s;aid he to his boy, (who was &s;itting pen&s;ive on a low &s;offa by the &s;ide of his bed,) I &s;hall have a proof of my patience under trying circum&s;tances, and of the &s;incerity of my profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the decrees of Heaven.&mdash;O &s;age in&s;tructor of man! let thy preceps and example be ever pre&s;ented to my thoughts! Thy great &s;oul divinely illuminated, la|boured for perfection. I a&s;pire to be like thee. Thy bright examples will ince&s;&s;antly &s;trive to imi|tate, and whil&s;t I patiently and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively endure, I will exert my&s;elf to improve in every thing by which I may, in future, &s;erve and ble&s;s mankind, for who&s;e &s;ervice only would I wi&s;h to live. All are my brethren, of one benevolent, glorious, Al|mighty Father. I love them as &s;uch. I weep over their mi&s;eries, I am humbled for their errors, and my own. Without the power of doing them good, to me life would be in&s;ipid, worthle&s;s and intolerable. May kind heaven protect my &s;overeign parents, my &s;i&s;ters my friends and fellow citizens; and in its own time, bring to light the dark plots of our enemies, and effectually defeat their malicious de|&s;igns. Then will my integrity &s;hine forth with a

<P>Perceiving the boy was affected, he a&s;ked him whether he could, by any means, convey a letter to his &s;i&s;ters, without injury to the tru&s;t impo&s;ed in him. For Nytan would not, for the world. &s;olicit of him a favor contrary to the injunctions he had received from his ma&s;ter, and the dictates of his con|&s;cience. 'No, my lord, replied Ge&s;&s;eng, I am un|der oath. I dare not attempt it.' 'Nor dare I, returned the Prince, to pur&s;uade you to betray a tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you. To break an oath is to tempt the vengeance of Heaven. The vile&s;t that ever di&s;|honored our country and its laws, never yet could be &s;o fool-hardy. Swear to me that you have no orders that touch my life.&mdash;Why Ge&s;&s;eng are you &s;ilent? Then I perceive you have &s;uch orders.'&mdash;' I dare not, my lord, to make you any reply on this &s;ubject,' an&s;wered Ge&s;&s;eng.&mdash;'Enough&mdash;poor deluded boy! exclaimed the Prince; I well know that you, of your&s;elf, can have nothing again&s;t me. You are bribed high. The temptations of gold and diamonds have prevailed again&s;t humanity, and ren|dered you, perhaps, in de&s;ign a murderer.&mdash;But O! Ge&s;&s;eng; can you be proof again&s;t the tremendous vengeance of the Almighty, which mu&s;t inevitably fall upon a murderer? &s;ooner or later you mu&s;t feel it. What then will avail the riches heaped up|on you, by your vile emyloyer?&mdash;But do you not already perceive he mu&s;t be a villain?&mdash;Nay do you not di&s;cern that he mu&s;t be your greate&s;t enemy who

could in&s;tigate you to the perpetration of &s;o black a crime? Are you not, by this time, convinced, that &s;uch a man mu&s;t be the traitor and enemy to his country, and indeed to all the world; and not the per&s;ecuted Nytan? I &s;ee you are convinced. I &s;ee you &s;tagger from your horrid purpo&s;e, and that I have no further cau&s;e of fear.'</P>
<P>The boy fell upon his knees; and with cla&s;ped hands, and tears gu&s;hing out.&mdash;'Never, never, cried he, will I be guilty of &s;o black a deed. If die I mu&s;t&mdash;I will rather die. Forgive me, dear Prince, and I &s;olemnly &s;wear, in the &s;acred pre&s;ence of the avenger of wrongs, that I will, henceforth, be care|ful of your life, though at the expen&s;e of my own.</P>
<P>'It is well, replied Prince Nytann, and happy for you, my boy,&mdash;and Heaven be prai&s;ed on your own account, as well as for my&s;elf. But let us re|tire to re&s;t. I will love you, and con&s;ult my pillow for our mutual &s;afety. Upon which,&mdash;tru&s;t me, my dear boy, the happine&s;s and &s;afety of many thou|&s;ands depend.

They then re|tired to bed. But Nytan &s;lept but little. He re|volved a thou&s;and important things in his mind. He had been now three weeks &s;hut up in his cham|ber, with no other company than Ge&s;&s;eng. For, not one of the guards of the ca&s;tle appeared before him. He bore his misfortune with a philo&s;ophic tranquility becoming the greatne&s;s of his mind, and one who fore&s;aw great con&s;equences that would a|ri&s;e from it, important to him&s;elf, his family and minkind.</P>
<P>There were a &s;et of enthu&s;ia&s;ts in different prov|inces of China, who were wholly devoted to their hypocritical prie&s;ts. They had never the counte|nance

of the Emperor, though tolerated under cer|tain wi&s;e re&s;trictions. Renien, the Emperor, who was very learned and a great writer, had, in &s;ome of his publi&s;hed works, (which were of great rep|utation throughout all China, and other countries,) expo&s;ed the ab&s;urdities of tho&s;e religious &s;ects; &s;o that their prie&s;ts were daily lo&s;ing their con&s;equence. The greate&s;t body of them was in the province where the in&s;urrection began. Hence Nytan was led to conclude, not without good rea&s;on, that his enemy had made u&s;e of tho&s;e prie&s;ts and their di&s;ciples to promote rebellion in the empire, and he was pre|paring a letter to his father, repre&s;enting his &s;u&s;|picions, and urging various weighty rea&s;ons that induced him to conclude they were well founded. How to convey his letter he had not been able to determine. He had only inclo&s;ed it in one to his &s;i&s;ters, who, he was confident would be the very la&s;t to believe any thing derogatory to his character, hitherto unimpeached.</P>
<P>A religion that contains in its bo&s;om the &s;eeds of vice and oppre&s;&s;ion, and which tends to enflame in|&s;tead of de&s;troying vicious inclinations, ought to be expo&s;ed by every friend of virtue and the intere&s;ts of mankind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Through the influence of fal&s;e religions, that which inculcates real piety and humanity, hath but little influ|enced men inclined to imbibe errors&mdash;to pervert truth&mdash;to be religiou&s;ly as well as philo&s;ophically deceived.</NOTE> Such was the &s;entiments which pre|vailed in the court of Renien. The &s;ects of enthu|&s;ia&s;ts, and the promoters of fanatici&s;m, were therefore inimical to the reigning power of China, and might well be &s;uppo&s;ed to exert them&s;elves when they could act with apparent &s;afety again&s;t it. 'Tho&s;e ba&s;e prie&s;ts, then, &s;aid the impri&s;oned Mandarin, were the props on which the plotting mini&s;ter built his revolu|tionary

Their total de&s;truction will be the happie&s;t and mo&s;t glorious aera of which the world ever boa&s;ted. How fortunate will it prove to me; Ge&s;&s;eng, if my letter finds acce&s;s to my father and &s;overeign.' This was the general te|nor of the Prince's conver&s;ation with his boy in the morning while he was &s;hewing him his jewels and diamonds, which were of &s;uch high value that ei|ther of them was &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e &s;everal large provinces. One he pre&s;ented to Ge&s;&s;eng, as an earne&s;t of what he might expect in future. 'Now my dear boy, &s;aid he let us wa&s;h and dre&s;s for the day&mdash;and eat our breakfa&s;ts with merry hearts. I have a &s;trong pre-&s;entiment of &s;ome favourable event today or before we &s;hall &s;ee the &s;un ri&s;e again above the hori&s;on. See you that portrait, continued Nytan, looking at his favorite picture.? Tho&s;e characters you &s;ee at the bottom of it, inform me of things that excite in me the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes. When you go out to the guard, remember the nece&s;&s;ary cau|tions I have given you: be di&s;creet: punctually ob|&s;erve what I may have occa&s;ion to &s;ay to you. The time will come, when (if you are now faith|ful to me) you will have the be&s;t rea&s;ons to con&s;ider your pre&s;ent attendance, on me, as the mo&s;t fortunate of events.

<P>IT was on the very day of this &s;ea&s;onable com|mencement of friend&s;hip between Prince Nytan and his boy, that the vile mini&s;ter of mi&s;chief had given the latter a potion of poi&s;on for the pri&s;oner, which was to be &s;low in its fatal operation, that his death might be con&s;idered as the effect of &s;ickne&s;s owing to his clo&s;e confinement, to chagrin, and being de|prived of tho&s;e exerci&s;es to which he had been be|fore daily accu&s;tomed. The boy had delivered up the poi&s;on to his newly acquired friend; at the &s;ame time &s;hewing him a large &s;um of gold and &s;everal valuable diamonds which he had received from San|den, with the promi&s;e of ten times as much, when the work of death was done. 'Reserve all &s;aid Nytan, for the mi&s;erable labourers who live about this ca&s;tle, and others. You will never want it. As &s;oon, therefore, as you have opportunity di&s;tribute it in alms. Remember what our great law giver hath &s;aid;&mdash;<HI>Be ble&s;&s;ed, and render thy&s;elf fortunate by deeds of charity; thus re&s;embling according to thy mea&s;ure, the giver of all things.'</HI> 'My dear Prince, cried the boy, (now &s;oftened with contrition, grat|itude and love,) how ble&s;&s;ed am I already in your friend&s;hip and &s;alutary coun&s;els! I &s;hall mo&s;t cer|tainly do as you &s;ay, in this, and in every thing. Indeed, my dear and mo&s;t re&s;pected &s;ir, I feel my|&s;elf, as it were, another kind of being than what I formerly was, before I revealed the black de&s;ign. I was far from being happy. I had fears and trem|blings, with painful reluctance; and &s;u&s;pected my employer of a de&s;ign upon my own life, to prevent his being di&s;covered after the poi&s;on &s;hould have de|&s;troyed you.

and a &s;lavi&s;h dependence upon a ba&s;e, wick|ed man!' 'It is highly probable, an&s;wered Nytan, that, to prevent all po&s;&s;ible means of di&s;covery, he would have taken your life. Let us now act with prudence and caution; and rely upon the Supreme di&s;po&s;er of events. Perhaps, one day more may free us from any further danger.</P>
<P>While the boy was gone down into the ca&s;tle to prepare dinner, Nytan &s;at down before his window, con&s;ulting one of his books; and comparing what he found in it, with the intelligence he had obtained from the characters at the bottom of his favorite picture, which hung on the wall by the &s;ide of his bed. He had ju&s;t attainted to what he was in &s;earch of all the forenoon, when the boy entered with their dinner. He made no communications to Ge&s;|&s;eng; and appeared, all the time of dinner, in a deep &s;tudy. Ge&s;&s;eng eat with him in &s;ilence: when the little dining table was removed, he was di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed till &s;un&s;et to take the air, and prepare &s;upper. The door being &s;hut, locked and barred on the out|&s;ide, as had been u&s;ual; Nytan laid him&s;elf on his couch, the window being open, contemplating the gay and beautiful pro&s;pects before him, and the per|fections of the Great Creator and Upholder of the u|niver&s;e. At the head of his couch, on his right hand, &s;tood a little cabinet, containing his books, and among other things, a &s;mall &s;pying-gla&s;s. He took the &s;pying-gla&s;s in his hand and looking thro' it clearly di&s;cerned &s;everal large bodies of armed troops, both hor&s;e and foot, pa&s;&s;ing over the hills, which greatly &s;urpri&s;ed him. An army marching through the country &s;o near the capital was a &s;ight never &s;een but once before in his father's reign; which was the only time he had ever beheld &s;uch an appearance of war as was now before his eyes. He viewed them attentively a con&s;iderable
<PB N="27" REF="038495_0026_10122C9550EFD890">
while, as they de&s;cended one hill, marched along the valley beneath, and a&s;cended over another, till at lengh they pa&s;&s;ed out of &s;ight. Inflamed as he was with the de&s;ire of knowing what was going for|ward, and the de&s;ire of being pre&s;ent where his eyes now could no more reach;&mdash;he had but one re|&s;ource. Folding his hands together, and fixing his eyes upon his favourite picture,&mdash;'Go, cried he pretty picture! fly quickly, and bring me intelli|gence what bu&s;ine&s;&s; tho&s;e troops are upon, and who employs them. You can do no le&s;s for one that loves you, and &s;aved you from near peri&s;hing in the mire. Suffer me not to die here with terror.' The pic|ture flew directly out of the window, and was gone out of &s;ight in a moment. Now, &s;hall &s;oon be &s;at|isfied, &s;aid the Prince to him&s;elf, my &s;weet little picture, I &s;ee, is grateful for the &s;ervice I have done it. It will be here again pre&s;ently with the tidings I now am mo&s;t anxious to hear. I &s;hall learn how my father is employed, and what my mortal enemy is doing. I &s;hall reap the fruits of my deep re&s;earches and unwearied &s;tudies. I will therefore compo&s;e my&s;elf to &s;leep, till Ge&s;&s;eng arrives with &s;upper.&mdash;And &s;oundly he &s;lept, till the boy's key rattling in the lock rouzed him. He aro&s;e quick|ly, and &s;at over again&s;t the window to take his &s;up|per. The &s;un was now &s;etting and it was time for the picture to return. Nytan eat his &s;upper in eager expectation; but the picture came not. He grew impatient, and ordered a chaffing-di&s;h of coals, into which he ca&s;t a perfume. Then &s;aying over a few my&s;terious words&mdash;the picture obeyed not the &s;ummons. Nytan was greatly &s;hocked at this. It was a &s;ummons, he imagined, ever to be obeyed. But now it failed.

matter I have done my duty. I &s;hall certainly, therefore, know before day, whence this unexpect|ed delay ari&s;es, if I &s;leep not, and I feel not well enough to &s;it up. Should I &s;leep, Ge&s;&s;eng, I &s;hall be nearly undone.' 'Heaven forbid it, my deare&s;t Prince, cried Ge&s;&s;ing, I will mo&s;t certainly keep you awake. I will &s;ing to you, and talk all the time.' 'Singing, an&s;wered the Prince, would a|larm the guard; and I would not, on any account, it &s;hould interrupt me, to night. But reach me that vial and a gla&s;s. This, added he, will keep me awake, (drinking a gla&s;s from the vial) I had like to have forgot. Give me a gla&s;s every two hours. You &s;ee the vial is again repleni&s;hed, and do you take two little wafers, which you will find in the lowe&s;t draw of my cabinet. They will &s;erve to keep you wakeful. But they have no effect upon tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed their eighteenth year: neither does the liquor in the vial an&s;wer any purpo&s;e to tho&s;e who are under that age.'</P>
<P>The boy having eat the wafers, and placed a lamp at the bed's head, they both lay down and fell to reading. They read for &s;everal hours. Ge&s;|&s;eng had ri&s;en to give the Prince his third gla&s;s,&mdash;when, on a &s;udden, a great light &s;hone into the win|dow. The boy &s;tartled, let fall the vial, which was broken in pieces. Hark! exclaimed the Prince, what &s;weet mu&s;ic is that I hear? It draws nearer to the window. They li&s;tened till the mu&s;ic ad|vanced directly under their window. The light was like mid-day. They di&s;tingui&s;hed a female voice, and heard di&s;tinctly the&s;e words, Maidens, give place. Let me come under the window, and a&s;k leave of the beautiful and accompli&s;hed Prince Nytan, to pre&s;ent my&s;elf before him, and give him his beloved picture; and let him know what delay|ed its return.' Nytan &s;prang from his bed to the
<PB N="29" REF="038495_0028_10122C9A07143D98">
window in a moment, and cryed, 'You are hearti|ly welcome; but whoever you are, you mu&s;t tell me by what means you can be with &s;afety, conveyed to a place &s;o very high from the ground. Be&s;ides, my chamber is &s;o &s;mall, that it can by no means contain half the gay company you mu&s;t have with you, and which, likewi&s;e, were it in my power I &s;hould be very glad to entertain. For I a&s;&s;ure you I am nearly tired out with this &s;olitary life.'&mdash;He was about to add further,&mdash;When a beautiful little yellow-bird flew into the window by the &s;ide of him, and perched on the corner of the cabinet. Nytan turned about from the windows, to &s;ee what a pretty bird he had in his chamber; and the boy advancing to take it in his hands. 'Touch me not, pretty youth, &s;aid the yellow-bird. You &s;ee, Prince, I have made bold, on the welcome you have ju&s;t giv|en me, and it is to put an end to your concern. I have brought you your faithful picture; and there it hangs in its place. As it is a little a&s;hamed on account of its keeping you &s;o long in a painful &s;u&s;|pen&s;e. I have undertaken to &s;peak for it, and to ac|quaint you with what you want to know. But, fir&s;t, I mu&s;t inform you who I am, and of the intere&s;t I take in your future fortunes. Know, then, that I am the merry and good natured Fairy Leingreing, who&s;e palace is at the bottom of the &s;ea that rolls its waves again&s;t the walls of this ca&s;tle. I was journeying through the air, from Per&s;ia, when I met your picture flying in &s;uch a prodigious hurry, that one could not get a &s;ingle word out of it. I was almo&s;t affronted to &s;ee it pa&s;s by without deigning to give an an&s;wer of two words to my kind &s;aluta|tion. So I even turned my cour&s;e after it to know the cau&s;e of &s;uch a piece of rudene&s;s. By a tali&s;|man in the golden chain, which you &s;ee about my neck, I found the cour&s;e the picture had taken&punc;
<PB N="30" REF="038495_0029_10122C9C205129B0">
though it was gone out of &s;ight; and quickening my &s;peed, I &s;oon came up with it. For I could fly as &s;wiftly as the fleete&s;t of all the choice pictures that adorn my grandmother's palace in the i&s;land of pictures. I found it fluttering about among the re|bellious troops; till, at length it darted into the gen|eral's pocket, and in&s;tantly flew out again, into the air, with his written directions. Away it darted through the clouds, giving me a &s;ide glance, with a forbidding air. But I flew after it, with velocity enough to overtake it. You, Prince, are too wi&s;e and knowing, young as you are, not to di&s;cern, that like a good natured fairy, I had but little difficulty in being reconciled to a picture, a relation of my grandmother's, and to detain it till we had done &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides getting news. For indeed no time was to be lo&s;t. The rebel troops were march|ing, as we found by the orders, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the &s;tronge&s;t citadels, for your enemy and fal&s;e accu&s;er. Another army, under the command of a wicked Genie, was advanced, (as we likewi&s;e found by tho&s;e &s;ame orders) near the capital City. And your father was in eminent danger of loo&s;ing both his empire and his life. For rebellion had made a rapid progre&s;s, through the influence of the mad fanatics, whom the fal&s;e mini&s;ter had found means to engage on his &s;ide. But you &s;hall hear in a few words how matters are at the pre&s;ent moment. The chief commander, having no orders to produce, mu&s;t wait till he gets them renewed; and as to the commanding Genie, I have ordered him to his old confinement. His army, finding their leader to be run away, will quarrel among them&s;elves, and be di&s;per&s;ed. The Prie&s;ts and their &s;illy dupes I am about to handle pretty &s;everely. But you Prince mu&s;t remain no longer here.' 'Ah &s;weet bird re|plied Nytan, that I very well know, yet an oath

confines me to this chamber, and you are &s;ensible it is impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould violate it. To regard it, therefore, as it becomes me; and at the &s;ame time to ab&s;ent my&s;elf from this ca&s;tle and my coun|try. I have accompli&s;hed the means of &s;eparating my chamber from the ca&s;tle, and tran&s;porting it, with my&s;elf and my companion, to Mount Cauca&s;us, where I have &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s.' Very well, replied the yellow-bird; but let us have &s;omething to eat fir&s;t. For I am very hungry, and &s;tand in need of a good &s;upper, con&s;idering the work I have to do be|fore to morrow night.&mdash;Yet, after a &s;econd thought, we can &s;up after your chamber has begun its aerial journey; (for I mean to go with you, it being noth|ing out of my way,) and, our repa&s;t being already prepared by my girls below; as we mount in the air, they &s;hall hand it into your chamber door.' 'Thank you with all my heart, for your company, &s;weet bird and accompli&s;hed Fairy, rejoined Nytan, we &s;hall &s;oon be in motion from hence." Then pronouncing &s;ome my&s;tical words well under&s;tood, and in&s;tantly obeyed by the invi&s;ible fairies and ge|nies, the chamber flew off, with a terrible noi&s;e, and launched into the air. Then, fixing a &s;pear of gold and &s;everal other metals, in a hole on the out|&s;ide of the window, pointed towards the mount, the chamber pur&s;ued its de&s;tined cour&s;e. In the mean|time, the Fairy's girls handed into the door, two large bowls covered, one of gold, the other of burnt china, and a flaggon of wine; taking their leave with the following complimentary &s;ong&mdash;</P>

<P>The guards were frightened out of their wits. For the ca&s;tle &s;hook and trembled as though it was falling in pieces. Some of them ru&s;hing forward, and thinking to enter the little chamber, fell head|long through the aperture which u&s;ed to be clo&s;ed at the chamber door. Others ran out into the court|yard to hear the fine mu&s;ic in the air. See the mu|&s;icians they could not. For both they and the cham|ber were rendered invi&s;ible. The happy travellers now uncovered their bowls, and fixing their table near the open window, began their midnight repa&s;t. Ge&s;&s;eng handed them wine in cups of gold; a&s;king the little yellow bird's ble&s;&s;ing, as he placed the cup before it. 'That you have with all my heart, re|plied the yellow bird. Regard the councils of this amiable friend of yours, and mine: Be faith in his &s;ervice, and my ble&s;&s;ing will ever follow you. It will not be long before your fidelity and attach|ment, to this lovely, worthy young man, will be more effectually tried; and I agreeably flatter my|&s;elf, that, in the trial, you will come off with ap|probation and honor. You &s;erve the &s;on of a great and renouned Emperor, and a &s;on, worthy of a fa|ther &s;o great, &s;o wi&s;e, and &s;o good;&mdash;a &s;on, whom I &s;incerely love and re&s;pect; and who&s;e intere&s;ts I &s;hall ever regard and advance, to the utmo&s;t of my power: and likewi&s;e tho&s;e of all his faithful adhe|rents: In doing which, I am well &s;atisfied that I &s;hall be &s;erving the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind.</P>
<P>BOTH Ge&s;&s;eng and the Prince were greatly af|fected with tho&s;e generous commendations: and the little bird, or fairy, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf particular|ly

to Nytan, thus continued her di&s;cour&s;e. 'I &s;hall leave you pre&s;ently, &s;aid &s;he, and, as your &s;tay will be but &s;hort where you are now going, take this ring, and wear it con&s;tantly. If at any time, you &s;hall have occa&s;ion for my pre&s;ence, rub it, and I &s;hall immediately appear before you. If you only want to hear from me, &s;end the picture, which will be proud of flying on your errants as long as her de&s;|tined hour permits her. I am now going to the i&s;land of pictures to &s;ee its relations; with whom I have &s;ome affairs of con&s;equence. Con|cerning which I may be, hereafter, permitted to acquaint you.' They then conver&s;ed together on a variety of entertaining and improving &s;ubjects&punc; till day was almo&s;t ready to appear, and the chamber re&s;ted on the &s;ummit of mount Cauca&s;us. The Fairy, as &s;he perceived it, bid them farewell, and bent her cour&s;e to the i&s;land of pictures.&mdash;The pal|ace of libraries was one of the greate&s;t wonders in the world, for its prodigious dimen&s;ions, and the infinite number of valuable books it contained. The good Genies who loved learning, had been for &s;everal thou&s;ands of years collecting them for their own u&s;e, and for the u&s;e of their particular favour|ites. By his art, Prince Nytan could command one of tho&s;e Genies, who dwelt at certain &s;sea&s;ons in a magnificent grotto on one &s;ide of a va&s;t rock. His bu&s;ine&s;s, then, was with the Genie, to procure from him the keys of the palace, and to obtain di|rections about the way to it, and the admi&s;&s;ion of his little chamber in the grand apartment of libra|ries, which was &s;pacious enough to admit fifty &s;uch chambers, and without his chamber being admitted into that apartment, which contained the books he was de&s;irous of peru&s;ing, he had no means of enjoy|ing that plea&s;ure and advantage. Having, therefore,
<PB N="34" REF="038495_0033_10122CA45A7E8820">
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his boy in &s;earch of the Genie, he next com|mi&s;&s;ioned the picture to the yellow-bird with his letters to his father and &s;i&s;ters, which he had forgot to deliver to it; reque&s;ting the good bird to fly into the palace window, whil&s;t they were at breakfa&s;t, and drop them into their tea-cups. Soon after the picture was gone on this errand, he beheld from his window, Ge&s;&s;eng leading towards it a little fright|ful looking old man, who&s;e head was ten times larger than the re&s;t of his whole body, and with on|ly one large eye, which was fixed in the middle of his forehead. He wore a mon&s;trous cap.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He wore a mon&s;trous Cap, re&s;embling female head|dre&s;&s;es in the reign of oddities.</NOTE> He held in his right hand, a &s;cimetar three yards in length; and advanced with a low and &s;olemn pace. The boy would have been frightened almo&s;t out of his wits, had not the old man encouraged him, by telling him he was as harmle&s;s as a fly.&mdash;Keep your eyes off from me, &s;aid he, laughing, if you don't like my looks. Nytan him&s;elf was, at fir&s;t, a little &s;tartled at the &s;ight of &s;o hideous an object. For he had never &s;een him before, nor indeed, any thing half &s;o ugly and di&s;gu&s;ting. When the old man was arrived to the door of the chamber, he lay down his &s;cimitar on one &s;ide of it. Nytan and his boy helped him in, and &s;eated him on a low &s;offa. 'I am giddy-headed, and weak with old age, &s;aid he, as he dropped on the &s;offa. Nothing could have tempted me to &s;o long a walk before eating my breakfa&s;t, but you mu&s;t me obeyed. Let me then know your further commands; and when you have given me &s;omething to eat, I &s;hall go about them with more cheerfulne&s;s.' 'I want the keys of the palace of libraries, replied the Prince. I am going thither to &s;tudy awhile in my chamber.' 'How
<PB N="35" REF="038495_0034_10122CA670ADC6D8">
can that be? returned the old man; or rather the Genie E&s;dren. But why, continued E&s;dren, would you go &s;o va&s;t a journey over the ocean, &s;ince it is in my power, on certain conditions, to procure you, in le&s;s than two hours, as many books, as you want.' 'What are the conditions, a&s;ked Prince Nytan?' 'They are only, replied the old man, that you u&s;e your endeavours to render me a &s;trong and hand|&s;ome youth like your&s;elf.' As Nytan was about to return an an&s;wer to the Genie; with a &s;mile, his picture re-entered the window and took its place on the wall. 'Picture, cried the Prince, here is a de|formed Genie, above a thou&s;and years old, who has made me the unrea&s;onable reque&s;t to re&s;tore to him youth, &s;trength and beauty.' 'As de|formed as I am, returned the Genie, I would not change conditions with you; &s;ince the &s;tate I am in is be&s;t, for the time it is to la&s;t, which is but very &s;hort. What the Creator cau&s;es us to be, is al|ways the be&s;t condition for us, and we ought always to be re&s;igned and thankful. And yet, Prince, your plea&s;antry being &s;et a&s;ide, &s;uch are the conditions; and I would have you exert your&s;elf in my behalf. Per|haps you are de&s;tined to be in&s;trumental in that change of my circum&s;tances which it is appointed &s;hould &s;oon take place.' 'The reque&s;t of E&s;dren is not &s;o unrea&s;onable neither, &s;aid the picture, and I believe you can do for him with my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I long to &s;ee him in a le&s;s hideous form. And he &s;hall fetch you twenty of the be&s;t volumes in the palace of libraries, which you may &s;tudy in your chamber, while you are travelling over &s;eas and lands: but fir&s;t let me give you &s;ome little account of the man. From being one of the hand&s;ome&s;t of Genies, who have the privilege of immortality, and the perpetual bloom of youth with all its vigour and activity, the accidental indulgence of a &s;ingle
<PB N="36" REF="038495_0035_10122CA8167E31A8">
thought contrary to rectitude, required the tran&s;|formation into this ugly figure, for a certain term of time. We, good Genies, and Fairies, are apt to err once in a while, and dearly do we &s;mart for it. Such is our de&s;tined lot, till the hour of con|firmation in the highe&s;t abodes of perfection, to which we eagerly &s;oar. But, the moment for his re-a&s;&s;uming his proper form and vigour is arrived. Catch the drops, you perceive di&s;tilling from me, in the palm of your hand, and pour them on his head.' Prince Nytan did as he was commanded. The old man ro&s;e up, threw his cap out of the window, and &s;tood ready for his approaching renovation.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the &s;on of Renien, poured the drops on the head of E&s;dren, than he &s;aw be|fore him, in&s;tead of a deformed old man, a youth as gay and hand&s;ome as him&s;elf. He threw his arms round his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him again and again. Ge&s;&s;eng leaped for joy.&mdash;The chamber &s;hook and trembled.&mdash;The picture congratulated E&s;dren, and,&mdash;O wonderful to relate!&mdash;leaving its &s;tation on the wall, &s;tood before them, a lady of a mo&s;t beautiful and maje&s;tic form!&mdash;It was Puria, the wife of E&s;dren! &s;he flew into his open arms! rap|ture &s;ucceeded rapture, and congratulations &s;ucceed|ed congratulations.</P>
<P>All this happened within twelve minutes after the Genie had entered the Prince's chamber. Nytan thought proper to remind him how weak and hun|gry he was, not long &s;ince; and a&s;ked him whether he had lo&s;t his appetite, or intended to live only up|on love? If it be &s;o, continued he, it were ill to in|terrupt your care&s;&s;es. The admonition was gra|ciou&s;ly received, and they were about to &s;it down to eat, when, E&s;dren recollecting him&s;elf, propo&s;ed breakfa&s;ting in his garden, on a terrace, from which they would enjoy a fine pro&s;pect. This being read|ily
<PB N="37" REF="038495_0036_10122CAAD664ECE8">
agreed to; and Nytan fixing the &s;pear in its hole they found them&s;elves, in&s;tantly on the terra&s;s. There is no occa&s;ion, &s;aid he, of leaving my cham|ber, to which, you know, I am indi&s;pen&s;ably con|fined to &s;ince we are now in your garden, and have every advantage of the pro&s;pect from the win|dow. Here then, let Ge&s;&s;eng &s;pread the table, and &s;et on our breakfa&s;t. But O! fair lady! &s;ay, how am I to return the &s;urpri&s;ing obligations you have laid upon me? 'By not thinking of them at all, replied &s;he. It is but ju&s;t nothing as to what I hope to &s;erve you in. When you picked me up, from the miry canal, only as a fine picture to hang in your chamber, you did me a great kindne&s;s, of which, in &s;ome future day you may be better in|formed. As &s;oon as we have done eating, we mu&s;t ha&s;ten after your books, and having brought them to you, our family calls us away immediately, to look after its affairs. In the mean time, you may remain in our garden as long as you plea&s;e, and make u&s;e of the grotto in our ab&s;ence, after we have &s;erved your pre&s;ent occa&s;ions.' 'But dear la|dy, returned Prince Nytan, you have not informed me about my letters.' 'I was about to tell you, an&s;wered &s;he, that your father, &s;i&s;ters and friends are well; the Empre&s;s, your mother, &s;lowly re|covering from the di&s;ordered &s;tate of health into which your cruel u&s;age had thrown her. You will at a proper &s;ea&s;on, have further communications from the Emperor's Court.' 'Alas! cried the Prince, I fear I have been too bold and forward in troubling that worthy lady, the fairy of the &s;ea, with my letters.' 'Far from &s;o, replied the wife of E&s;|dren, you only oblige her, in laying your com|mands upon her; and, therefore, make your&s;elf perfectly ea&s;y and happy on her account. We are
<PB N="38" REF="038495_0037_10122CACEEED36D0">
all intere&s;ted, highly intere&s;ted in your welfare. You can do us no greater plea&s;ure than to command our &s;ervices. We &s;hall never be weary of doing you kind offices.' Nytan was about to expre&s;s his grate|ful acknowledgments, but &s;ilence was enjoined him, and E&s;dren bid him ob&s;erve the maidens on the green below, who were preparing to dance for the entertainment of the company. The Prince was all attention, whil&s;t the maidens performed &s;everal dan|ces, after the manner of the Chine&s;e, and, likewi&s;e of the &s;everal countries in which E&s;dren alternately re&s;ided. They concluded with the following &s;ong, addre&s;&s;ed to &s;pring, it being that &s;ea&s;on of the year; and a farewell compliment to their gue&s;ts, the Prince and Ge&s;&s;eng, who&s;e uncommon beauty and loveli|ne&s;s had excited their affection, and in&s;pired their cheerfulne&s;s and vivacity.</P>

<P>The maidens, one after another, a&s;cended the ter|race, and advanced to the window; which being low, the Prince reached out, and ki&s;&s;ed them, pre|&s;enting each with a diamond ring to wear for his &s;ake. Ge&s;&s;eng went out, and made them a low bow, as they were retreating from the window. E&s;dren, and his fair partner then retired in order to proceed to the palace of libraries; fixing but two hours for their journey and return. Prince Nytan was now in good &s;pirits, having received &s;o many marks of regard and affection. He &s;at down at his window, waiting the return of his re&s;pectable and kind friends. Ge&s;&s;eng in the mean time, was going in and out from the grotto for his amu&s;ement, and preparing, from the Genie's garden and kitch|en, a recruit of provi&s;ions, as he had been ordered, for the next adventure his lord was determined to make over the immen&s;e ocean.</P>
<P>Thus time pa&s;t very agreeably, till E&s;dren and his con&s;ort returned, which they did in little more than an hour, though their journey was above two thou|&s;and miles. The twenty volumes being handed in|to

the chamber, and the friends parting with re|luctance, and many care&s;&s;es and affectionate em|braces; the two adventurers being &s;eated, and the door &s;hut, the chamber mounted in the air, and pa&s;|&s;ing over the ocean, was &s;oon out of &s;ight. Their cour&s;e was directed to an i&s;land in the Indies.

<P>A MIND po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;cious rectitude, Heav|en's choice&s;t gift to the Denizens of earth; as it voluntarily re&s;ts its whole de&s;tiny with the faithful protecting power whence it originated; it calmly beholds the vici&s;&s;itudes of life, convinced, beyond a doubt fortune that vi&s;its or awaits it, is wi&s;ely and benevolently appointed; and that the re&s;ult of all will prove its highe&s;t good, its perfect felicity. Ah! how happy is the allotment of the being thus forti|fied again&s;t the ills of life! That &s;uch ought to be the mind of every human being, the character the Deity hath exhibited of him&s;elf, as the never fail|ing friend of all the intelligent creation, &s;ufficient|ly evinces to the wi&s;e and di&s;cerning. They are certain of a kind &s;upport under, and a compleat relief from every affliction in the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable moment; for which, in the &s;evere&s;t and darke&s;t trials, they patiently wait, and with a lively re&s;ignation. Such was the mind of the per&s;ecuted Prince Nytan, when he experienced &s;o wonderful an interpo&s;ition in his behalf; when powers &s;uperior to humanity, ro&s;e, indignant, for the protection of virtue, and the de|feat of its malicious foes. Under &s;uch mighty pro|tection he &s;oars aloft, and traver&s;es the va&s;t ocean to di&s;tant lands, bending his cour&s;e to his de&s;tined i&s;land. Yet, though virtuous, great, and wi&s;e, &s;ome events mu&s;t needs occur, in the cour&s;e of &s;o
<PB N="42" REF="038495_0041_10122CB62BE23120">
well directed a life, to remind him of his depen|dence; and that he is &s;till to improve in prudence and circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>Ge&s;&s;eng, inadvertantly leaned again&s;t the cham|ber door; which being carelesly fa&s;tened by a &s;tring, the &s;tring gave way, the door flew open, and he fell backwards into the ocean. The door, indeed had a lock, but it had been rendered u&s;ele&s;s by the &s;hock the chamber had received on its &s;eparation from the ca&s;tle. Prince Nytan turned his head to the door, on hearing the cry of Ge&s;&s;eng as he fell, and perceiving he was gone, immediately cau&s;ed his chamber to de&s;cend to the &s;urface of the water. But, as he was reaching out his hand to him, a mon&s;trous fi&s;h &s;wallowed him down his throat. Nytan was obliged in&s;tantly to retreat, with his chamber, from the mon&s;ter, and the convul&s;ions he made in the Wa|ter. But &s;uddenly recollecting him&s;elf, and glanc|ing an eye at the tape&s;try on the wall at &s;ome my&s;|terious characters and drawings, he took up his mag|ic gla&s;s, and reconnoitred the fi&s;h. The fi&s;h, ob|&s;erving him, called out to him with a loud voice, 'O! gracious mandarin, Prince of lords! cried he, I have pre&s;erved the boy from peri&s;hing. In return for this piece of &s;ervice, &s;ave an unfortunate Genie from the malice of the wicked Gendor, who having thus transformed me&punc; as you &s;ee, confined me below the depths of the &s;eas. You have only to throw your magic &s;pear at me, and I &s;hall appear in my proper &s;hape, enter with the lad into your chamber, and place the &s;pear in your hand.' 'Thou lie&s;t vile mi&s;creant! replied Nytan, thou art that very Gendor, whom thou taxe&s;t with malice. In&s;tantly deliver up my boy; or the vengeance of E&s;dren, and the &s;on of Renien, &s;hall inflict upon thee a more dreadful puni&s;hment.'</P>
<P>The affrighted trembling Gendor, immediately
<PB N="43" REF="038495_0042_10122CB7BB089068">
vomited out Ge&s;&s;eng, and bid him&s;elf in the bottom of the ocean. Ge&s;&s;eng &s;wam towards the chamber, and &s;oon found him&s;elf in &s;afety with his beloved lord, who helping him to &s;trip, rubbing him with cloths till his &s;kin was dry, bade him repo&s;e him|&s;elf on the bed; where covering him with the &s;heet and counterpane, and giving him a gla&s;s of cordial, he &s;at down by him congratulating him on his fortuate e&s;cape, and at the &s;ame time vehement|ly accu&s;ing him&s;elf for his neglect of the door and lock, which he &s;oon after, rendered properly &s;e|cure. Ge&s;&s;eng took all the blame to him&s;elf; as &s;aid he, 'To look after &s;uch things was my bu&s;i|ne&s;s.' Prince Nytan a&s;&s;ured him he intended him not an indirect reproof, and that if one was to blame, &s;o was the other. 'I &s;urely, continued the Prince, ought to have looked about me a little better. But, you only, my dear boy have been the &s;ufferer.' Then ki&s;&s;ing him, he advi&s;ed him to endeavour to get a little &s;leep, which would be of &s;ervice to him after the violence and purturbation he had undergone.</P>
<P>The next morning the I&s;land appeared in view, and, before the &s;un had well ri&s;en, they were land|ed on the &s;ummit of a hill, not far from its centre. The Prince, now having his &s;pying-gla&s;s improved to his mind, (through which he could now &s;ee al|mo&s;t every thing above a thou&s;and miles round him, with as much per&s;picuity as though he was upon the very &s;pot to which he directed the gla&s;s;) now looked through it round the i&s;land, which appeared to be very large, and as he afterwards found, above three hundred leagues in length, and two hundred in breadth. It likewi&s;e appeared to be very fruitful and plea&s;ant. He next directed the gla&s;s to his father's palace. The windows of the palace, and of his father's clo&s;et being open he dis|tinctly &s;aw him at his table, indicting a letter, which
<PB N="44" REF="038495_0043_10122CB94E99FDC8">
he perceived to be to himself; having read the whole of it, he beheld his father &s;ign his name, with joy too, he &s;aw him fold the letter, &s;uper&s;cribe, and &s;eal it; then deliver it to the me&s;&s;enger in wait|ing; who went away with it. The contents of it were congratulatory, and affectionate. They like|wi&s;e gave him his liberty, which was the greate&s;t joy to Nytan; who now looked upon him&s;elf as free from his oath, and to go in and out as he plea&s;|ed. He therefore gave a &s;hout of rapturous joy, embraced his beloved Ge&s;&s;eng, and taking him by the hand 'Now &s;aid he, my lovely friend, we will walk and reconnoiter the i&s;land with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure.' They went out together, and de&s;cended the hill into an agreeable vale encompa&s;&s;ed with woods, except &s;everal openings which afforded a de|lightful pro&s;pect.&mdash;This i&s;land was inhabited by thirty men who had e&s;caped from &s;hipwreck, and was unknown to any others but Genies and Fairies, one of whom, who&s;e name was Ravenzar, owned a palace under ground, in the heart of the i&s;land, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed va&s;t riches. Tho&s;e men had lived on the i&s;land about eight years, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on what the i|&s;land afforded, having &s;everal pieces of ground en|clo&s;ed for wheat, &s;heep and cattle, and little huts. Ravenzar who him&s;elf, un&s;een found means to con|vey them into the i&s;land, could ea&s;ily afford them better accommodations in a place from whence it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to free them&s;elves; but he thought be&s;t for them to remain as they were, till they had acquired fixed habits of virtue, and a con|tempt for the vices and luxuries of the country from whence they originated. To this purpo&s;e the good Genie con&s;tantly a&s;&s;i&s;ted them. Prince Nytan knew all this, and fell in with the noble de&s;igns of Ra|venzar. Be&s;ides, he had been informed, by &s;ome characters on his tape&s;try, than the hour was not
<PB N="45" REF="038495_0044_10122CBB64F597F8">
far off, when he &s;hould obtain from the Genie, an immen&s;e trea&s;ure for benevolent and charitable pur|po&s;es. It was on the knowledge of the&s;e, and oth|er things re&s;pecting the i&s;land, that he had &s;et out, and arrived to it.</P>
<P>Ge&s;&s;eng had greatly improved, under the tuition of &s;o wi&s;e and generous a Prince, con&s;idering the &s;hort time he had been with him. As it would there|fore, be now of great advantage to them both, Ny|tan began to acquaint the youth with &s;ome of his great and benevolent de&s;igns. All his purpo&s;es were nobly di&s;intere&s;ted, and effectually tending to the good of others; e&s;pecially of the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of mankind, the poor, and the oppres&s;&s;ed. Such a life as was that of this Prince was indeed invaluable. He formed, in him&s;elf the truly great character and no man can with propriety be called great, any further than he is benevolent and virtuous, a pro|moter of the happine&s;s of his fellow creatures; in doing which this accompli&s;hed Prince and chief mandarin was ever bu&s;y. The greater part of the nights he was in&s;tructing young Ge&s;&s;eng; improving and invigorating his mind with the mo&s;t u&s;eful learn|ing, and virtuous precepts. Ge&s;&s;eng, too, was em|ployed, the be&s;t part of each day, in the &s;tudy of &s;uit|able books.</P>
<P>Prince Nytan now communicated to this well in|&s;tructed youth, his bu&s;ine&s;s on the i&s;land (which he denominated the i&s;land of Ravenzar) and his de&s;ign likewi&s;e of vi&s;iting nations and kingdoms; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to kindle the &s;acred flame of philanthropy in foreign courts, where, it appeared from what he had learned, to be almo&s;t, if not altogether extin|gui&s;hed by vice, luxury, and intemperance. 'Tho&s;e, &s;aid he, who are in exalted &s;tations, &s;hould not de&s;ire to live but to ble&s;s mankind, and render them &s;till
<PB N="46" REF="038495_0045_10122CBE8AF35C28">
happier. The longed-for period I hope is not far di&s;tant, when true knowledge and virtue will diffu&s;e their &s;alutary influence through every region of the habitable world. Let us do all in our power to bring forward the happy aera. But, it is now time for us to return and prepare breakfa&s;t. I expect Raven|zar will be with us, in a few minutes. How plea&s;|ant and refre&s;hing is a walk after &s;o long a confine|ment. I hope to have a more plea&s;ant one pre&s;ent|ly, when we &s;hall vi&s;it the Genie's palace, and the few not altogether unhappy inhabitants of the i&s;land.'</P>
<P>'Ah! Prince, thou wilt for once be di&s;appoint|ed! for this is the only walk thou art to enjoy for &s;everal years yet to come.

Be wary, and omit nothing. Remember the ne|glected lock. I am not permitted to render my&s;elf vi&s;ible, nor again to addre&s;s thee till &s;ometime af|ter thou &s;halt return to this i&s;land.

<P>THE fortunate &s;on of Renien found his tape&s;try had not deceived him, when he peru&s;ed the deed of gift from Ravenzar, which was written on a marble &s;lab in letters of gold, and witne&s;&s;ed by four other Genies, his friends who lived in the in|terior of Africa, and who had ju&s;t called to carry him thither, on affairs of highe&s;t moment. The marble &s;lab, on which the deed was written, was framed with gold and diamonds, and bordered with beautiful paintings of romantic &s;cenes. It was hung up on the wall, in the Prince's chamber, by the &s;ide of his couch, in the place of his favorite picture. It was indeed a noble ornament there. His liberal benefactor could well &s;pare the palace, and trea&s;ures, as likewi&s;e the i&s;land, as he owned &s;everal other palaces in different parts of the world, equally enriched with gold and diamonds, and va&s;t tracts of land, equal to any in the mo&s;t fertile coun|try. But rich, profu&s;ely rich as Prince Nytan was now become, he valued not his trea&s;ures, but as they &s;erved to promote the happine&s;s of others. The hour when he &s;hould again vi&s;it this i&s;land was wrote on the &s;lab; and was di&s;tanced three years and an half from that of his leaving it.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the chamber progre&s;&s;ed with an unprece|dented

velocity, the Prince and Ge&s;&s;eng, were pur|&s;uing their &s;tudies; till they found them&s;elves on the continent of Africa. Nytan clothed him&s;elf mag|nificently, and put on his head a crown of gold, a pre&s;ent from Ravenzar, as was likewi&s;e a golden &s;ceptre. He then &s;ent out Ge&s;&s;eng to a&s;&s;emble be|fore him, the king of the country, and his nobles on bu&s;ine&s;s of high import to their future grandeur and felicity; ordering Ge&s;&s;eng to repre&s;ent in be|coming terms, the impracticability of his leaving his habitation, or pa&s;&s;ing over the thre&s;hold of his door, till he had vi&s;ited other nations, and fulfilled his high commi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>To contract the relation of Re&s;hang, let it &s;uf|fice to &s;ay, the Prince was cordially received by king Zanger and his nobility who entered into his benevolent views, and eagerly imbibed his in&s;truc|tions; gratefully accepting the u&s;eful books pre|&s;ented to them in their own tongue. Here the Prince, having been &s;tationary five weeks, took leave of the king, the nobility and gentlemen, and with Ge&s;&s;eng, bent his cour&s;e to other regions, promi&s;|ing them to vi&s;it them again in &s;ome future period, when he hoped the king and him&s;elf &s;hould be able to congratulate each other on the &s;ucce&s;s of their en|deavors for the good of that kingdom, and when he likewi&s;e hoped to find their &s;alutary influence extend|ed to the neighbouring petty kingdoms. They like|wi&s;e &s;ettled the means of their corre&s;pondence while ab&s;ent from each other.</P>
<P>After Prince Nytan had &s;pent near three years and an half, (as was determined) in&s;tructing kings and their &s;ubjects, in a great number of barbarous nations, and laid the foundation of future happy revolutions; he at length, bent his cour&s;e to the i|&s;land of Ravenzar, and ha&s;tened to accompli&s;h tho&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="038495_0049_10122CC68380D5D8">
great and noble de&s;igns he had &s;o much at heart. He therefore, with eagerne&s;s, exerci&s;ed his &s;kill to accelerate his progre&s;s. Perhaps, wi&s;e and good as he was, he was rather too impatient; and Heaven might &s;ee fit a little to check the rapidity of his thoughts and the incredible velocity <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> flying vehicle.&mdash;On a &s;udden, the air was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> darken|ed!&mdash;When Nytan, lifting up his eyes, beheld a formidable body of gigantic mon&s;ters, blazing with fire, and rolling va&s;t mountains down the &s;kies up|on his chamber! A&s;toni&s;hment &s;eized him! come hither Ge&s;&s;eng, cried he, and &s;ee what fatal mi&s;|chief is ready to cru&s;h us!&mdash;The youth beheld&mdash;trembled and turned pale! he &s;unk to the floor and embraced the knees of his lord, in &s;peechle&s;s ter|ror! the Prince, however, had the pre&s;ence of mind to recollect what he had long &s;ince learned from cele&s;tial &s;cience, that, in the moment of greate&s;t di&s;|tre&s;s, deliverance was at hand. He knew that &s;ome|thing mu&s;t occur to relieve a mind in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion as was his, or he mu&s;t &s;uddenly peri&s;h; &s;u&s;|pended as he was in the air, in &s;o &s;lender a vehicle, which was now arre&s;ted in its progre&s;s;&mdash;the bot|tomle&s;s ocean beneath him, and tremendous ruin ru&s;hing down from above, urged on by the ven|geance of malicious &s;pirits, of &s;uperior power! Re|po&s;ing in the Almighty, he accidentally ca&s;t his eyes upon the ring on his finger, and rubbing it hard, at the &s;ame time flinging open his chamber door, the fairy Leingreing in&s;tantly entered. The Prince embraced her with joy! Ge&s;&s;eng ki&s;&s;ed her hand in rapture! immediately a mo&s;t dreadful hur|ricane arose! loud thunders roared, and awful light|nings glared! the univer&s;e &s;eemed to be one ma&s;&s; of fire! and all nature convul&s;ed and di&s;&s;olving! the Fairy &s;uddenly locking the door, commanded the chamber to the bottom of the ocean. It in|&s;tantly

de&s;cended, at the moment Prince Nytan clos|ed the window; but almo&s;t as in&s;tantaneou&s;ly a|gain immerged from the waves, and a&s;cended into the air; when all was calm! The mountains were melted, rent and &s;cattered; the bodies of tho&s;e wick|ed Genies, (for &s;uch they were) were annihilated; and tho&s;e mi&s;chievous &s;pirits, &s;eized with panic terror, never afterwards dared to appear a&s;&s;em|bled.</P>
<P>Thus the fortunate &s;on of Renien experienced a third deliverance from the efforts of his malicious and vengeful enemies. The &s;econd was from the &s;uddenly conceived &s;tratagem of the huge Leviathan, who &s;wallowed up Ge&s;&s;eng, and who&s;e further in|tention was, when the Prince &s;hould have thrown his &s;pear, as he reque&s;ted of him, to vani&s;h with that tali&s;man to the bottom of the &s;ea; well know|ing that the Prince being deprived of it, mu&s;t in|evitably peri&s;h. This &s;tratagem of the wicked Ge|nie, transformed into a mon&s;trous fi&s;h, was as &s;ud|denly defeated, as conceived and attempted. Was not &s;uch an event de&s;igned to admoni&s;h the young adventurer of the importance of the mo&s;t careful at|tention to the minute&s;t affairs? That it was &s;o, was fully a&s;certained to him by the memento from Ra|venzar&mdash;remember the neglected lock: and &s;hould not this la&s;t terrible event effectually &s;erve to &s;olem|nize his mind, in&s;pire weighty reflections, &s;hew him his dependance, and re&s;train his vivacity and over-eagerne&s;s in his pur&s;uits? The in&s;tructions, deducible from both, were indeed of the la&s;t con&s;e|quence to his conduct and &s;ucce&s;s through life. Neither were they lo&s;t upon the Prince any more than were the good coun&s;els of the Fairy. He renew|ed his confidence in the arbiter and di&s;po&s;er of worlds, and conductor of the de&s;tinies of their in|habitants, who, he well knew, could remove moun|tains,
<PB N="52" REF="038495_0051_10122CCA2B5790D8">
&s;hould they ob&s;truct his progre&s;s in accom|pli&s;hing the good of mankind: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> effect which was all he de&s;ired. For, to be him&s;elf happy without beholding the happine&s;s of his fellow creatures, was the furthe&s;t of all things from the wi&s;h of his noble and generous heart. He could by no means be ble&s;t in him&s;elf, but in &s;ure pro&s;pect of the felicity of every exi&s;tence in the creation. The fairy Leing|reing continued with Prince Nytan till his arrival at the i&s;land of Ravenzar. She informed him what &s;he had done with the rebellious prie&s;ts, and of the fate of the arch rebel Sanden. The prie&s;ts were confined to the mines for a certain time; which being expired, they were to exi&s;t &s;eparately, and at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from each other, in a &s;tate of trial, and with a &s;canty allowance. The treacherous and manoeuvering mini&s;ter was &s;ecluded in a grove on the very i&s;land to which Nytan was now ha&s;ten|ing, and &s;urrounded with perpetual darkne&s;s; in which condition he was to remain till the Fairy's de&s;igns upon him, &s;hould be accompli&s;hed by Ny|tan him&s;elf; to which purpo&s;e &s;he gave him &s;uita|ble in&s;tructions. Being now &s;afely landed on the i&s;land, Leingreing bid him and Ge&s;&s;eng an affec|tionate adieu; acquainting them that Ravenzar was &s;till in the interior of Africa, and would be &s;ome time detained from vi&s;iting them; and on that ac|count it was he had made over to the Prince, his i&s;land, palace and trea&s;ures. She likewi&s;e inform|ed them, that the entrance into the Genie's palace would be rendered vi&s;ible to them as they were walking.</P>
<P>The fairy Leingreing being gone, the Prince and Ge&s;&s;eng went to a fountain and bathed. The &s;un was &s;etting, when they returned to the chamber; where after taking &s;ome refre&s;hment, and &s;ecuring the door and window, they retired to bed, leaving
<PB N="53" REF="038495_0052_10122CCC9FE28960">
two wax candles burning on a marble table, which &s;tood at the bed's head. There was nothing to di&s;|turb their repo&s;e. Nytan's was the more &s;weeten|ed by renewed liberty. 'Though I long to be with my parents, my &s;i&s;ters, and other friends, &s;aid the Prince, as he was dre&s;&s;ing in the morning, yet &s;o are the duties of my life circum&s;tanced, that it will not be in my power to enjoy &s;o great a plea&s;ure, till I have been through Europe, and effected &s;ome very important things for my&s;elf and this i&s;land. How|ever it affords me a great &s;atisfaction that my dear Fairy has informed me they were in good health; that the mon&s;ter rebellion, was cru&s;hed, and fanat|aci&s;m breathing its la&s;t. Agreeable tidings the&s;e, my Ge&s;&s;eng! they will animate our zeal in the cau&s;e of liberty, of truth and virtue. Let us ha&s;ten, then, to the little community of this i&s;land, which we have been &s;o long prevented from vi&s;iting. After|wards we will de&s;cend into the palace of our bene|factor.'&mdash;</P>
<P>The enterprizing &s;on of Renien, had already per|formed exploits of benevolence, which no confine|ment found means to baffle, or &s;chemes and enter|prizes of malevolence to defeat&mdash;enterprizes con|ducted by great, but wicked &s;pirits; beings endow|ed with an immortal &s;trength and activity. It is true, indeed, he was not unaided.

Yet all&mdash;all, throughout the boundle&s;s regions of creation, are animated, guided, and rendered happily &s;ucce&s;sful, by its omnipotent Lord, in every glorious work of benevolence and love!

an unre&s;erved confidence in, and &s;ecret application to the great creator of worlds, and conductor of all their operations.</P>
<P>The Prince and his companion having breakfa&s;t|ed, walked out on the banks of the river, &s;haded by the fine&s;t trees, of various kinds, be&s;ides fruit trees, which where on either &s;ide their way. Following the cour&s;e of the river, they &s;oon reach the huts of the inhabitants, who were not a little &s;urprized at the &s;ight of two &s;trangers. The Prince a&s;&s;embling them under the &s;hades of a venerable oak, acquaint|ed them with his de&s;igns, and gained their concur|rence. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e men had been very infirm, the chief of the time of their inhabiting the i&s;land. The &s;pot on which they re&s;ided, was exceeding plea&s;ant. The mountains and woods formed a mag|nificent amphitheatre around them, &s;ituated as they were in an exten&s;ive valley, inter&s;per&s;ed with a va|riety of groves and fruit trees of all kinds, and flow|ers, which perfumed the air, whil&s;t the feathered &s;ong&s;ters entertained them with their charming melody. They were gradually regaining health, and were indeed greatly plea&s;ed and animated with the behaviour and de&s;igns of their new friend and benefactor, who next bent his cour&s;e towards the lofty ridge of mountains that divided the i&s;land into two equal parts. Through a va&s;t rock among the&s;e mountains, he entered the Genie's (or rather his palace, with Ge&s;&s;eng. Striking the rock with his foot, it opened, and di&s;covered to them a &s;tairca&s;e of white marble, which they de&s;cended, the rock clo&s;ing upon them. There was a glimmering light, which increa&s;ed as they de&s;cended, till all was bright refulgent day. As they walked on, a va&s;t hall ap|peared before them, at the end of a &s;pacious court paved with black marble. The gate of the hall, at their approach, unfolded its two golden leaves. On
<PB N="55" REF="038495_0054_10122CD1AB2DB218">
entering, they were &s;truck with the beauty, gran|deur and magnificence of every thing that &s;aluted their eyes. In the middle of the hall was a large table &s;pread and loaded with provi&s;ions of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite kind. Above the table, on rai&s;ed alcoves, &s;tood forty maidens, and the &s;ame number of young men, who all bid the Prince welcome to his palace, adding that they were his &s;ervants, and ready to o|bey his commands. 'My benevolent friend, an|&s;wered Prince Nytan, increa&s;es my obligations, in commi&s;&s;ioning you to &s;erve me. I have bu&s;ine&s;s for you, which I doubt not the &s;ervants of &s;o great and good a lord, as Ravenzar, will perform with plea&s;ure. But you are &s;till to con&s;ider your&s;elves as belonging to him, and only graciou&s;ly lent to me. After we have eaten and viewed the palace and gar|dens, we &s;hall find &s;ome agreeable employment for you. Come then, Ge&s;&s;eng, let us partake of the boun|ties of our common friend and benefactor.' Whil&s;t they &s;at eating, the ladies entertained them with a concert of mu&s;ic, which was performed in that charming perfection of which fairies were &s;o capa|ble. When they were ri&s;en from the table, the Prince de&s;ired two of the young men to at|tend him, and &s;hew him the buildings and apart|ments of the palace. Leaving the hall, they walked through a &s;pacious gallery, viewed a number of magnificent chambers, and the immen&s;e riches in the trea&s;ury apartments. They went, next, into the gardens; which were large, and beyond de&s;|cription beautiful. But that which gave an inex|pre&s;&s;ible addition to tho&s;e enchanting &s;cenes, was the appearance of above thirty of the mo&s;t charming female forms, ju&s;t ri&s;en from the chry&s;tal fountain, in which they had been bathing, and covering them|&s;elves with their milk white robes! The Prince and his attendants, being unob&s;erved by them turn|ed
<PB N="56" REF="038495_0055_10122CD337CDC828">
into another alley of the gardens. Still the love|ly females were in view through the grove of trees, where they made a &s;tand till they advanced from the fountain. Prince Nytan then moved towards them, and addre&s;&s;ed them in the polite&s;t terms. After which they all walked together, and &s;eated them|&s;elves in a &s;uperb &s;aloon: when one of the ladies, who appeared to be the elde&s;t, knowing the Prince by the de&s;cription that had been previou&s;ly given of his per&s;on, made him the following &s;en&s;ible addre&s;s. 'We are commanded, noble and generous youth, by our kind protector, to acquaint you with our lit|tle hi&s;tory, as one who will become intere&s;ted in the felicity of our future lives. Though you &s;ee us among beings of a &s;uperior order, we are of the race of mortals. Snatched from de&s;truction, when in &s;waddling clothes, de&s;erted as we were by un|natural parents of the different countries in which we were born, by the benevolent and compa&s;&s;ion|ate Ravenzar; under his fatherly care we have been nouri&s;hed and brought up in this palace, now your property. The all accompli&s;hed and paternal Ra|venzar has &s;pared no pains in our education, that might render us fit to appear in the world, and u&s;e|ful in whatever &s;phere of life it is allotted for us to move. By him we are now committed to your care and direction. What improvements we have made you are to be the judge, and a&s;&s;ign us to &s;uch depart|ments as to you &s;hall appear mo&s;t elegible. To you, therefore, we cheerfully re&s;ign our&s;elves, repo&s;ing in you an unre&s;erved confidence as our friend and future guide.' When the lady uttered this la&s;t &s;en|tence, they all ro&s;e from their &s;eats, and paid Ny|tan the re&s;pect he &s;o ju&s;tly merited, who conver&s;ed with them with that mode&s;ty and &s;uperior &s;en&s;e &s;o natural to him. After which they went together into the hall. The waiting maidens and young
<PB N="57" REF="038495_0056_10122CD6ADB5C840">
men, paid the ladies that deference in which they had always been in&s;tructed. Prince Nytan then ac|quainted them, that he &s;hould be ab&s;ent from them a day or two in the is&s;land; and, if longer, he &s;hould &s;end them word. Then ordering the two young men who attended him into the garden, to follow him and Ge&s;&s;eng, he returned into the i&s;land. 'I am about to &s;hew you, &s;aid he to the two young men, as they followed him towards the huts, our little &s;o|ciety, and to &s;et you and your felllow &s;ervants to work for us.'&mdash;'Which we &s;hall do with the great|e&s;t plea&s;ure, replied the young men. Every command of yours, mo&s;t re&s;pected Prince, will be to us an in|di&s;pen&s;able obligation. Our &s;ervice, time, and abili|ties are ever yours.' 'Well then, my friends, re|turned Nytan, (for &s;uch I &s;hall ever call you) you now &s;ee before you, the diminutive dwellings of the inhabitants of the i&s;land. You are this day to pro|vide them with better ones. Before morning let me have thirty new hou&s;es compleated on this &s;pot of ground over which we are walking. Let them be, likewi&s;e, furni&s;hed with every thing nece&s;&s;ary and convenient. Be&s;ides there mu&s;t be out hou&s;es, wells and gardens, with all things needful to each. I mu&s;t have likewi&s;e a large palace, with a &s;pacious and magnificent garden for my&s;elf with every nece&s;|&s;ary building and furniture. All the buildings mu&s;t be of grey poli&s;hed marble The hall, which mu&s;t be erected in the middle of my palace, mu&s;t be &s;uffi|ciently large to entertain a thou&s;and gue&s;ts, without being in the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed for want of room. In the hall, too, a table mu&s;t be &s;pread with the mo&s;t &s;uitable provi&s;ions, by the middle of next day, with twenty waiters to attend. Before this la&s;t is done, one half of the gold and diamonds in the palace un|der ground mu&s;t be depo&s;ited in the trea&s;ury in my

palace. Several &s;ervants, male and female are al&s;o to attend, in future, on each inhabitant of the i&s;land, who are to dine in my hall on the morrow. When all is compleated give me notice.</P>
<P>The two young men bowed, &s;ignifying their cheerful obedience, and retired. Prince Nytan, then having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Ge&s;&s;eng to look after his cham|ber, and to wait there for him, directed his cour&s;e to the wood where his once dangerous and inveter|ate enemy was confined. The darkne&s;s in which he had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> involved, was now di&s;per&s;ed, and he found <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> employed in reading, reclined on a &s;offa under a magnificent canopy &s;urrounded by fragrant trees and flowers, with a carpet of green, before him of nature's forming.</P>
<P>'Ah! worthy and amiable &s;on of the illu&s;trious Renien, exclaimed Sanden, as &s;oon as he perceived the Prince advancing towards him, how rejoiced am I to &s;ee you, now no longer your enemy, but henceforward your mo&s;t &s;incere and zealous friend! I am confident, you will rejoice in the new forma|tion of a heart very early &s;educed and perverted by evil &s;pirits. I was apprized by the fairy, your friend, and mine, of your coming hither, and have been impatiently expecting you. O then, much injured Prince! let this meeting corre&s;pond with the wi&s;hes and reque&s;ts of &s;o charming a fairy as Leingreing, the &s;overeign lady of the &s;ea; and make what trial you think proper of the &s;incerity of my profe&s;&s;ions. I am wholly devoted to you.'</P>
<P>'Add no more, replied the generous &s;on of Re|nien, from henceforward, we are friends. As &s;uch, let me embrace Sanden, and now, lay upon me your commands, and they &s;hall be punctually fulfilled.' After many tears, Sanden re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Though, my dear Prince, I have the mo&s;t ardent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to vi&s;it my family, and to throw my&s;elf at my

&s;overeign's feet, yet I am ready, with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, to attend you, wherever you are going, that I may be perpetually convincing you of the &s;inceri|ty of my friend&s;hip and love.'</P>
<P>'It is mo&s;t rea&s;onable, an&s;wered Prince Ny|tan, that you &s;hould fir&s;t return home, and be|&s;ides, in &s;o doing, you will, at this juncture, be&s;t &s;erve our common cau&s;e, at the &s;ame time that you gratify your own wi&s;hes, which are highly com|mendable, and which, I perceive, corre&s;pond with the &s;entiments of the Fairy, our common friend.&mdash;Ob&s;erve yonder exhibition, &s;tationary in the air.' Sanden lift up his eyes, and beheld, in the air, a repre|&s;entation of a large ve&s;&s;el, and an I&s;land to which the ve&s;&s;el was arrived, and ca&s;ting anchor. As they both viewed the ve&s;&s;el, the i&s;land di&s;appeared, and the ve&s;&s;el moved forward, de&s;cending to the &s;ea &s;hore, to which a tall figure, on its deck pointed. 'Then we mu&s;t even follow it, &s;aid Nytan. This calls you immediately home. As we are walking, I will con&s;ider, and afterwards propo&s;e to you what ad|vantages I would derive from this unexpected &s;a|vor.'</P>
<P>When the two friends had walked in &s;ight of the &s;ea, they e&s;pied the ve&s;&s;el. The i&s;land was on all &s;ides &s;urrounded with rocks of that prodigious height, that no mortal could penetrate into it without the aid of &s;uperior power. Before they e&s;pied the ve&s;|&s;el, they had a&s;cended a mountain which overlooked the rocks. The fairy Leingreing now de&s;cended in a chariot, drawn by winged hor&s;es, and &s;aluting the Prince and Sanden&mdash;'Come, mount into the chariot, &s;aid &s;he, and let us away. They were no &s;ooner &s;eated with the fairy, in the chariot, than the hor&s;es expanded their &s;able wings, and cour&s;ed their way&punc; between the earth and heavens, down to the &s;ea &s;hore, where the ve&s;&s;el lay at anchor. In a
<PB N="60" REF="038495_0059_10122CDC314B2400">
few minutes the travellers, with the Fairy their conductor, were on board, and the ve&s;&s;el &s;et &s;ail. The &s;on of Renien then propo&s;ed, that after the ve&s;&s;el was arrived at Pekin, and Sanden re&s;tored to his friends and his &s;overeign, he &s;hould reque&s;t of the Emperor, in his name, to &s;end the &s;hip back loaded with goods, and families of the poore&s;t &s;ort, to &s;ettle in his i&s;land; acquainting the Emperor with the condition of the i&s;land, and the progre&s;s he was making in its &s;ettlement. This being a|greed to, and a letter wrote and delivered to San|den, for the Emperor, they &s;eparated with affec|tionate embraces; the &s;hip pur&s;ued its cour&s;e, and the fairy conveyed Prince Nytan, in her aerial cha|riot, to his chamber; where Ge&s;&s;eng was waiting his coming, and had made ready his &s;upper. The &s;un had now but one hour to fini&s;h his diurnal cour&s;e, when the Fairy and Prince entered the cham|ber, and &s;at down to &s;upper; enjoying the delight|ful pro&s;pects from the window and conver&s;ing on the mo&s;t u&s;eful and entertaining &s;ubjects. Supper being ended, they walked out, and &s;eated them&s;elves on a mo&s;&s;y couch, where the woods afforded them an agreeable &s;hade. They had a fine pro&s;pect of the river before them, of the lawns and groves on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and a ridge of mountains covered with hanging rocks and woods. The birds charm|ed them with their harmonious notes. The whole &s;cene around them was enchantingly romantic and picture&s;que; and led them into an affecting con|ver&s;ation on the glorious and magnificent &s;cenes of creation, till their minds were elevated, and enrap|tured! and in the warm effu&s;ions of their grateful and admiring hearts they poured forth in the fol|lowing ode:&mdash;</P>

The harmonious &s;ound of the voices of this re&s;pec|table company, well corre&s;ponded with the exalted &s;entiments they conveyed perhaps to the li&s;tening ears of invi&s;ible &s;uperior beings.

His &s;ervants obeyed, he walked on, with Ge&s;&s;eng, to the men who inhabited the huts, to con|gratulate, and introduce them to their new buildings, which the intervening groves prevented them from ob&s;erving. But, when Nytan brought them forth, and in view of the buildings and gardens, great in|deed was their a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration. Every thing, indeed, they beheld, was beautiful, grand, and elegant. Their hou&s;es which were of grey poli&s;hed marble, &s;tood in a circular form, at proper di&s;tances from each other and made a noble and magnificent appearance.

Here, being all &s;eated, they were fur|ni&s;hed, by the Prince and Ge&s;&s;eng, with delicious wines and fruits, as a refre&s;hment after walking.

They were the fir&s;t inhabitants of a once &s;olitary i&s;land; the founders of a community mo&s;t illu&s;trious and re|&s;pectable. The men had learned virtue and wi&s;|dom in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity. They were hardly pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life; and through temper|ance and proper exerci&s;e, were fa&s;t recovering their former &s;trength, alertne&s;s and activity. Their minds were well informed, and capable of greater improve|ments under the advantages they were now to obtain, with re&s;pect to which, Prince Nytan had as yet but
<PB N="66" REF="038495_0065_10122CE9F455E748">
executed a &s;mall part of his generous de&s;igns. Their per&s;ons were agreeable and commanded a great &s;hare of re&s;pect. The female part of this a&s;&s;embly, (who&s;e number exceeded that of the men by one on|ly, if we except Ge&s;&s;eng and the Prince,) might with &s;trict ju&s;tice be called perfect beauties. For, it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible that nature her&s;elf, with all her art and power, could add a greater lu&s;tre to her charms, or education to their accompli&s;hments. It could, therefore, be no manner of wonder, if the men became fa&s;cinated with &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of female beauty, lu&s;tre and dignity. After they had dined, and &s;eparated to different apartments, one of the men, who u&s;ed the greate&s;t freedom with Prince Nytan, reque&s;ted of him to be informed from what part of the creation he had drawn together &s;uch amazing prodigies of beauty and loveline&s;s; and where they intended in future to di&s;po&s;e of them|&s;elves. 'Alas! exclaimed he, if they are to leave us, I know not what will become of us. For all my friends appear to be enamored beyond the po&s;|&s;ibility of recovery. When they left the hall and bid us adieu&punc; every man of us was &s;eized with de|&s;pair.'&mdash;'Oh! replied the prince, you talk indeed like a romantic lover! and if all your friends are in your &s;ituation, we &s;hall hear of nothing but flames and darts, deadly wounds from cupid's fatal bow and quiver! &s;ure nothing can be done for you, con|tinued the Prince, laughing, in &s;uch de&s;perate cir|cum&s;tances;&mdash;lo&s;t to every thing but love! but, if my friend, it be really as you &s;ay,&mdash;perhaps I have but one remedy for this &s;udden and violent &s;torgee, and that is to hurry away tho&s;e dangerous beauties as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.'</P>
<P>Prince Nytan had commi&s;&s;ioned all the &s;ervants of Ravenzar to the &s;ubterranean palace, for &s;eve|ral things he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for among
<PB N="67" REF="038495_0066_10122CEC0ED4EBB8">
which the principal article was a large collection of books; the maiden &s;ervants were employed in hou&s;ehold affairs. He now retired to his chamber in the palace; where he found the books ranged in good order on the &s;helves round his clo&s;et. Ex|amining them he found they were a mo&s;t valuable collection on every art and &s;cience, and the be&s;t hi&s;|tories, many of them in the &s;everal languages he under&s;tood. He &s;at down at his clo&s;et window which looked into the &s;pacious and magnificent gar|den, limited only by the mountains that divided the i&s;land in two equal parts. The pro&s;pect before him was &s;ublimely grand and beautiful, and adapted to excite, in a mind like his, the mo&s;t noble and generous ideas. While he &s;at at the window in delightful contemplation, one of the &s;ervants entered to know his further commands. 'To-morrow &s;aid the Prince, you are to make a wide pa&s;&s;age through the va&s;t mountainous rocks that environ this i&s;land, and form a convenient and &s;afe harbour for my &s;hip. This done, you mu&s;t complete a hundred more dwelling hou&s;es, with every thing needful about them. They are for my expected countrymen. Acquaint me when all is fini&s;hed.'</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the new-ri&s;ing city &s;pent the afternoon in removing from their huts to the new buildings. The ladies, having apartments allotted them in the palace &s;pent part of the time, after din|ner, in viewing them, and the re&s;t in roving in par|ties, through the delicious garden. Ge&s;&s;eng, for his part, paid a vi&s;it to the &s;olitary chamber, were he &s;at alone, meditating on the unrivalled charms of the younge&s;t of the female orphans. She was a|bout his own age, that is to &s;ay, nearly eighteen, and had made at fir&s;t &s;ight, the tendere&s;t impre&s;|&s;ions upon his heart. In &s;hort, every man except|ing the Prince, had placed his affections on a lady.

So that the one and thirty orphans were all &s;udden|ly furni&s;hed with lovers, whom they likewi&s;e re|garded with equal affection: and the re&s;ult as will appear in the following book, was exceeding hap|py for both parties.</P>

<P>THE happy company, at Nytan's palace, already noticed, walked in parties, in the garden. Sometimes they reclined on the green banks, &s;had|ed by lofty pines and elms; at others, in delightful alcoves. On one &s;ide of the garden was a large and beautiful pavilion, &s;ituated on one of the highe&s;t hills, and the windows of which afforded the mo&s;t en|chanting pro&s;pects of woods and lawns, hills and val|leys, fields and grazing cattle, of the river, and the new buildings. A &s;tream of water ran winding by it, widening to the other &s;ide of the garden, part|ly &s;haded with groupes of trees and was mo&s;t plea&s;|ant to view, from the palace windows. Nytan took with him to the pavilion, &s;everal of the men whom he chanced to meet, as he walked out; and who were converting with an equal number of ladies. Here the maidens brought them tea, wine, bread and fruit, with which likewi&s;e, the other parties were &s;erved, in the alcoves, and under the &s;hades, where they were found reclining. In this manner they pa&s;&s;ed great par of &s;everal days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. At night they were all a&s;&s;embled in the hall to &s;up|per. In the mean time love ever active and enter|prizing,
<PB N="70" REF="038495_0069_10122CF36238FC80">
was perpetually exerting it&s;elf, in all its various and refined arts of per&s;ua&s;ion and endear|ment, upon the hearts of the two &s;exes, whether in companies &s;eparate, in one a&s;&s;embly, or alone, in the rece&s;&s;es of the chamber, or the groves. Tho&s;e with Nytan in the pavilion, were di&s;cerned by him to have made great progre&s;s in the tender, mutual affection which &s;hould ever precede the intimate and indi&s;&s;oluble tie of Hymen's bands. The con|ver&s;ation turned upon the refined and exalted plea|&s;ures of dome&s;tic life. The men, who had been well educated, di&s;covered excellent minds, and ju&s;t &s;entiments, in di&s;cour&s;ing upon that &s;ubject. The ladies appeared to be exceedingly gratified by every thing they advanced. Nytan &s;ung them a fine &s;ong, in prai&s;e of a dome&s;tic life, and the marriage &s;tate; and the company applauded him with the highe&s;t commendations. Several in&s;truments of mu&s;ic were on one of the tables. The ladies, at the reque&s;t of the Prince, took them in their fair hands, and hav|ing tuned them, played &s;everal fine airs, accompanied with their charming voices. The men were in raptures! and prevailed upon them to gratify them over and over again with their inimitable perfor|mances. This continued, till night brought all the company together in the hall. Ge&s;&s;eng was like|wi&s;e returned to them. He had an unu&s;ual air of gaiety that night, and made &s;wift advances in the af|fections of the fair mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart. Supper being over, the remainder of the evening was &s;pent in mu&s;ic and dancing and &s;prightly conver&s;ation, till the &s;ea&s;onable hour, of repo&s;e admoni&s;hed them to retire to their &s;everal apartments. At parting the men &s;ignified, their intentions of lodging, in fu|ture, in their new habitations. Nytan gave to each man two &s;ervants to attend upon him till they &s;hould hereafter be better provided for, on that &s;core, as
<PB N="71" REF="038495_0070_10122CF4EF787740">
he told them with a great deal of gaiety. The men, however, continued their daily vi&s;its to the palace, to enjoy the charms of female conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The &s;ix hundred hou&s;es, which Prince Nytan had ordered to be built, being compleatly fini&s;hed, he took &s;everal of his workmen to his little chamber, which &s;till remained where it fir&s;t landed; and or|dered them to erect a female &s;tatue on its roof, with a globe in one hand, and an olive branch in the oth|er; and the emblematical dove on its head. The whole to be ornamented with gold and diamonds. This was done in half an hour, and made a grand and beautiful appearance. Nytan looked on the workmen with admiration, to &s;ee with what a|&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, and con&s;ummate &s;kill and ingenuity they worked off, and erected the &s;tat|ue; which being compleatly fini&s;hed, &s;eemed to be a real living exi&s;tence, and to repre&s;ent the Prince's &s;weet and amiable di&s;po&s;ition, and peace and fe|licity to the world: He, being perfectly &s;ati&s;ied with the workman&s;hip, immediately &s;et all the workman to building hou&s;es, and laying out roads. Two, on each &s;ide his palace, were cut out through the mountains. And the river, which had many branches winding about the i&s;land, and which ran under the rocks into the ocean, was rendered navi|gable, from the harbour two hundred miles, and within twenty of its &s;ource. Whil&s;t the&s;e va&s;t works were going on, our diligent philanthropi&s;t retired to his little chamber for the re&s;t of the day, where he pa&s;&s;ed the time in reading till the &s;un was &s;itting. When, ri&s;ing, and about to return to the palace, a &s;plendid and beautiful picture came flut|tering into the window, with a little cage of gold wire hanging to it, enclo&s;ing a fine blue-bird. The picture fixing it&s;elf on the wall of the chamber. o|ver again&s;t the Prince, cried, 'O mo&s;t excellent

Prince and chief mandarin of China! behold what a lovely bird I have brought you! I was commi&s;|&s;ioned, with it to you, from my good aunt, the fai|ry Perieng. The bird is to accompany you in your travels, and you will find it a very diverting com|pany. You mu&s;t hang the cage clo&s;e to your win|dow, that it may enjoy the &s;weet refre&s;hing breezes, and the fine pro&s;pects. But, Prince, though it is now &s;un-&s;et, you mu&s;t take a trip with us to the i|&s;land of pictures, and &s;ee how we live. There is no night there. However, you may ea&s;ily get back to your palace before bed time.' 'Thank you, gracious, lovely picture! replied Nytan, for your &s;weet bird, as likewi&s;e for your kind invitation, of which I &s;hall avail my&s;elf, and &s;et out this mo|ment.' So &s;aying he &s;et his chamber in motion through the air; and half an hour conveyed them to the i&s;land of pictures. But how greatly was the Prince a&s;toni&s;hed, to &s;ee there, a va&s;t and magnifi|cent palace, of an amazing height, and almo&s;t bound|le&s;s dimen&s;ions! and illumined by four &s;uns at each corner of the lofty open roof! which dart|ed a &s;pendor beyond mortal &s;uffrance! but Prince Nytan was, for a while, rendered capable of endur|ing it. They de&s;cended into the court, and walked up to the grand porch.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is not unlike &s;ome my&s;terious de&s;criptions of the affairs of the &s;uperior order of beings.

<P>This i&s;land was famous for nothing be&s;ides the palace, and its inhabitants, in a va&s;t wood, the mi&s;|tre&s;s of which was the fairy Perieng, who was &s;ev|eral

thou&s;and years old. The pictures of the palace were wives of Genies, who though good genies, were, for &s;ome little inadvertences, &s;entenced to a &s;tate of gentle di&s;cipline, and bani&s;hment from their con&s;orts, who were &s;tationary in the va&s;t hall of the palace, in a &s;tate of contemplative confinement, till their hu&s;bands &s;hould be re&s;tored to them. Some|times indeed they were allowed to make excur&s;ions a|broad, or were &s;ent on important errants, at which times they were to take &s;pecial care not to fall a&s;leep, le&s;t &s;ome di&s;agreeable accident &s;hould befall them; as was the ca&s;e with the one Nytan picked up from a miry canal, &s;omewhat di&s;figured, but &s;till retain|ing its internal lu&s;tre. The fairy Perieng was her aunt, and all the others were her relations. Hence it was that &s;he took care of them, and was al|ways attentive to their fortunes, and happy in their rational improvements, and progre&s;s in virtue and wi&s;dom. She gave them the form of pictures, likewi&s;e, in compliment to her &s;ex as the faire&s;t part of the creation. Some of them, in their ex|cur&s;ions, went through a variety of adventures be|fore they could get back again to the palace, and their happier &s;tations in the hall.</P>
<P>After they had gone through the grand porch, they beheld before them an old lady, of very dimin|utive &s;ize, (for &s;uch was her de&s;tined figure for two hundred years,) &s;tanding at the foot of her throne, waiting their approach. It was the fairy Perieng. 'I wanted much to &s;ee you young man, &s;aid &s;he to Prince Nytan. Follow me into my clo&s;et. Then &s;ending away the picture, on &s;ome new errand, &s;he u&s;hered the Prince into her clo&s;et, where the con|tinued with him in conver&s;ation for the &s;pace of three hours and an half, giving him many &s;age coun&s;els for the direction of his future conduct.
<PB N="74" REF="038495_0073_10122CFB72384320">
She then carried him into the great hall, where ev|ery thing he &s;aw, was amazing, and pa&s;t adequate de&s;cription. The walls were looking-gla&s;s mixed with flames of fire. In the&s;e were the pictures fix|ed, in frames of fire, gold and diamonds; appear|ing every moment, of the pictures, the living orig|inals, and that, with a &s;plendor too dazzling for the eyes of mortals. They &s;ang &s;everal charming &s;ongs, complimenting the Prince, and his blue-bird. The hall being wholly open above, the &s;plendors of the palace overpowered the Prince, and he fainted. The fairy Perieng therefore ordered her &s;ervants to convey him to his chamber, where coming to him|&s;elf, he heard the voice of the Fairy&mdash;'Return quick|ly, beloved Prince, and pro&s;perity attend thee.</P>
<P>The Prince found his blue-bird very merry com|pany on the way home. 'But what am I to do? &s;weet bird, cried he, as the chamber re&s;ted on the ground in its former &s;tation, will you &s;uffer me to take you with me to my palace?' 'O by no means, replied the bird. But I will tell you how to plea&s;e me. Tran&s;port the chamber into your garden, in &s;ome ob&s;cure grove, there to remain invi&s;ible to ev|ery one but your&s;elf: and come and &s;ee me every day, and as often, each day as po&s;&s;ible. I &s;hall then be very well contented, with the window and door of the chamber left open, and &s;omething to eat and drink.' 'I will do every thing you &s;hall de|&s;ire,' returned Nytan,&mdash;'Then love me exce&s;&s;ively, rejoined the blue-bird, and I will &s;ing you the mo&s;t charming and diverting &s;ongs in the world, and tell you the fine&s;t &s;tories, when you &s;hall be in|clined to hear me.' 'Which will be as often as po&s;&s;ible, added Nytan, for you talk, and look &s;o en|chantingly, that nothing can plea&s;e me like your &s;weet company.' 'Ah! returned the blue-bird. I wi&s;h with all my heart you may never be weary of

me.' 'Heaven forbid exclaimed the Prince, &s;uch excellence &s;hould peri&s;h! and now my charming prattler! we are in the place of your choice. See what a lovely grove of trees and fragrant flowers &s;urround us, except the little opening before your window, which commands &s;ome of the fine&s;t views of the garden. What further orders have you for your devoted friend?' 'Go, an&s;wered the bird, to your company in the hall, bid them good night, and go to bed, and dream of your little lovely blue-bird till morning.' 'I will obey you to the utmo&s;t of my power, replied the Prince and &s;o &s;weet lovely bird, good night.' Good night, good night, cried the blue-bird: adieu charming young man, adieu!</P>

<P>Prince Nytan was &s;hewn, by the fairy Perieng, &s;everal mo&s;t valuable curio&s;ities, among which was a mo&s;t ancient Chine&s;e manu&s;cript, tracing that em|pire to its original, and relating many great and wonderful things of which the world is ignorant. She promi&s;ed him, the manu&s;cript &s;hould be put in|to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, after a cerrtain number of years. 'Be very careful and tender of the little blue-bird I &s;ent you, added the Fairy; and you may one day, find your account in it, and know further than you can at present, how much your powerful friends are intere&s;ted in your happine&s;s and pro&s;perity. To-morrow, you mu&s;t go to the palace of libraries, and load your chamber with the be&s;t books compo&s;|ed by Genies and Fairies, and likewi&s;e, by men of the greate&s;t learning and experience. There, al&s;o, you will find many finely wrote books by learned and ingenious women. Tho&s;e you have divide among the men and women you have with you. You will
<PB N="76" REF="038495_0075_10122CFFA0992760">
find no difficulty in gaining admi&s;&s;ion into the pal|ace: here are the keys.</P>
<P>The next morning, the Prince furni&s;hed his men with a further &s;upply of books from his own col|lection, and &s;et out with his chamber and blue-bird, for the palace of libraries. He &s;pent &s;everal hours there, examining the books. Each di&s;tinct libra|ry was compo&s;ed by one author only. Having load|ed his chamber, leaving &s;carcely room for him&s;elf and the blue-bird, (which entertained and charmed him all the while, with its &s;weet melody and con|ver&s;ation,) they returned before &s;un-&s;et. The morn|ing following he &s;upplied his friends with books. Then taking his &s;pying-gla&s;s, he went up to the roof of his palace, and looked out for his expected &s;hip; though the time was far from being elap&s;ed which he had allowed for the voyage, yet he knew not with what expedition the Emperor might tran&s;|act his affairs. Be&s;ides, he had a mind to &s;ee his father and the family. He viewed the palace&mdash;the grand metropolis and all the great cities, as far as the gla&s;s could afford the pro&s;pect. At length, he &s;aw the &s;pacious windows of his father's breakfa&s;t|ing apartment open, the Emperor, Empre&s;s, his &s;i&s;ters, and &s;everal other ladies enter and &s;eat them|&s;elves at the breakfa&s;t table. They all appeared to be very merry and in good health; which gave the &s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure to &s;o affectionate and dutiful &s;on. After viewing them again and again, he was obliged to deny him&s;elf of &s;o delightful a gratification, and de&s;cend to look after his important affairs. He of|ten made u&s;e of his gla&s;s, and never failed of &s;eeing his friends in good health, rendering thanks to Heaven for &s;o de&s;irable a privilege, when &s;o far &s;eparated from his paternal home. The Prince frequently took Ge&s;&s;eng with him to his clo&s;et, for &s;everal hours, and like wife the men,
<PB N="77" REF="038495_0076_10122D013974B998">
three or four at a time, that they might con&s;ult to|gether on affairs of con&s;equence to their future pro&s;|perity. And they were all daily employed, be&s;ides, in the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;tudies.</P>
<P>In the mean time his little blue bird was not ne|glected. There was an inchanting &s;weetne&s;s in its tongue, which often drew him to the cage. In honor to his lovely bird, which was perpetually talking and &s;inging of love, he erected, on the roof of the little chamber, at the four corners, cupids of gold, who&s;e &s;pread-out wings were &s;tudded with diamonds, as were the architives of the door and window. So that the whole out&s;ide of the chamber being gold and diamonds, made a mo&s;t &s;plended and glorious appearance; e&s;pecially when open to the &s;un. Whereas, to gratify the favorite bird, it was now concealed in a retired grove. The Prince took his bird out to view tho&s;e ornaments. He was anxious to know whether, (as &s;he examined them with apparent eagerne&s;s and &s;urpri&s;e,) they afford|ed an additional plea&s;ure to his &s;weet companion. 'My dear Prince, &s;aid the blue-bird, you have highly honored me, and convinced me more than ever of your friend&s;hip. Ah Prince! let us make us friends to the utmo&s;t, whil&s;t in this &s;tate of ex|i&s;tence; for, if we gain no friends here, we can by no means expect to find them on our appearance in the future world. You have many and valuable friends. Go, Prince, ha&s;ten and make us as many as you can. We can never po&s;&s;e&s;s too many worthy heorts. Gain them in every region. Your talents, your accompli&s;hments, your engaging per&s;on and manners, your divine philanthropy; the&s;e will ev|ery where commend you to the great and good.'</P>
<P>At length, the expected &s;hip arrived. From the lofty roof of his palace, Nytan with joy beheld her &s;afe moored in the harbour. He beheld and recog|nized
<PB N="78" REF="038495_0077_10122D045FF25840">
the countenances of his beloved countrymen, and ha&s;tened in his chariot to the &s;hore; leaving orders for twenty chariots to follow him. His friends were quickly adverti&s;ed of this arrival, and wanted no other &s;ummons to follow their beloved benefactor. What a glorious &s;cene was it to &s;ee this noble &s;on of Renien embracing and congratu|lating his countrymen, though the poore&s;t in all his fathers exten&s;ive empire! They were men, women and children; and though poor, yet wi&s;ely &s;elected. Not a few among them, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed knowledge and virtue, in a very eminent degree, though hitherto unfortunate, through various cau&s;es. They were conducted, &s;ome to the palace, others to the hou&s;es of the inhabitants; be&s;ides large tents were imme|diately erected, that every individual might be a|greeably accommodated. Fea&s;ts and entertainments now &s;ucceeded each other every day. The mer|chandize of the &s;hip was conveyed from the har|bour, and divided among the new &s;ettlers, who now became rich. At length they were conducted to their new-prepared habitations, with their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in chariots, and other convenient carriages, attended by Prince Nytan, Ge&s;&s;eng, and a few of their friends; the new roads being compleatly laid out and fini&s;hed for ea&s;y travelling. This was in|deed a plea&s;ant journey to them all, through a fine country, abounding with every thing, and which might well be called the garden of the world. The Prince and his friends continued with them &s;everal days, when all being &s;ettled to their wi&s;hes and far beyond their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations;&mdash;the Prince returned to be witne&s;s to a new and unex|pected &s;cene of wonder and joy. As he came within view of his palace, and the thirty new buildings, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the &s;pacious openings crowd|ed with men, women and children, who, by their
<PB N="79" REF="038495_0078_10122D05EE50C7F0">
dre&s;s appeared to be of foreign countries. He knew too much to fear an inva&s;ion, nor was he long in de|termining by what means &s;o va&s;t a multitude of people had found their way into an i&s;land guarded by powers that no human wit or force could &s;uc|ce&s;sfully oppo&s;e. He, therefore ju&s;tly concluded his friendly fairies and Genies had brought &s;ome worthy &s;ettlers to repleni&s;h it. This was indeed the ca&s;e. A me&s;&s;enger on hor&s;eback, rode up to the prince, and acquainted him that Ravenzar wait|ed for him in the hall of his palace. As he was ha&s;tening thither with the utmo&s;t expedition, he &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed his friend the Genie, by the dig|nity and benevolence of his countenance, advancing from the outer court of the palace to meet him. Ny|tan alighted from his chariot. They were in&s;tant|ly in each other's arms. After many endearing ca|re&s;&s;es, the Prince pre&s;ented to him Ge&s;&s;eng, and his other friends, whom the Genie cordially embraced. Shouts aro&s;e from the chariots&mdash;' For ever live the great Ravenzar, and the all accompli&s;hed Nytan! Hail! happy friends and inhabitants of this highly favored i&s;land! in true glory and &s;plendor forever flouri&s;h!&mdash;The two friends, and tho&s;e about them, bowed to the people, and then went up into the hall, where the orphan ladies, and their attendants, received them with joyful congratulations. An entertainment was &s;oon prepared, at which they all &s;at down, and every countenance expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t heartfelt plea&s;ure. The conver&s;ation at table, was gay and lively, and becoming gue&s;ts &s;o worthy, &s;o all-accompli&s;hed. After eating and conver&s;ing a|while, the company retired to the garden to walk; all but the two illu&s;trious friends, who remained, conver&s;ing in the hall till towards evening, when Ravenzar went down into the &s;ubterranean palace. The new &s;ettlers, who were no le&s;s than eighteen

thou&s;and, were accommodated with magnificent tents, &s;erved with every thing for which they had occa&s;ion, be&s;ides the be&s;t provi&s;ions the i&s;land afford|ed. This multitude, of all ages and &s;exes, had been long training up, by good fairies and genies, in ru|ral rece&s;&s;es, and &s;ubterranean palaces, for this fa|vored i&s;land; this happy a&s;ylum from a world of vice, luxury and oppre&s;&s;ion. A fleet, of twelve va&s;t &s;hips, wafted them to the abodes of peace, freedom and virtue.&mdash;The genie Ravenzar retired not mere|ly to re&s;t, but to provide for the new inhabitants. He, therefore, who could ea&s;ily perform the great|e&s;t things, cau&s;ed his immen&s;e palace, with its buildings and gardens, to immerge from the bowels of the earth, and form them&s;elves into four &s;pacious &s;treets, of elegant buildings. His gardens were divided into a great many, and one to each dwelling|hou&s;e. Be&s;ides, a great number of hou&s;es were built, gardens laid out, and all compleatly fini&s;hed that very night. So that, in the morning, the fam|ilies had nothing to hinder them from taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their new habitations, and preparing to en|ter upon their &s;everal occupations. Ravenzar hav|ing very early given them notice, and ordered eight hundred &s;ervants to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in conveying to their hou&s;es, their wives, children, and goods; before &s;un-&s;et they were all happily &s;ettled. The Genie then repaired to the palace, and reque&s;ted Prince Nytan to a&s;&s;emble, in the hall, the thirty original inhabitants, with the one and thirty orphan ladies. He then &s;eated him&s;elf at the upper end of the hall, waiting their attendance. When they were all a&s;|&s;embled, together with Ge&s;&s;eng and the Prince, Ravenzar addre&s;&s;ed them in the following &s;peech:</P>
<P>'Re&s;pectable and beloved friends! as I am un|der the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving you in a few hours, I have called you together, that I may fulfil the re|maining
<PB N="81" REF="038495_0080_10122D09A6D9FFC8">
offices of friend&s;hip and love, which are to conduce to the perfection of your future felicity. My&s;elf and my worthy frend and fellow labourer, Nytan, have been con&s;tantly attentive to every thing that might effectually conduce to your happi|ne&s;s and glory. You will, from henceforward, be left a long time to your&s;elves, to form agreeably to your wi&s;hes, a perfect happy nation, which will encrea&s;e, in &s;trength and efficacy, through every &s;ucceeding age. Our beloved Nytan, mu&s;t vi&s;it other countries. Yet, &s;till, though ab&s;ent from you, we &s;hall be attentive to your intere&s;t. The great power and abilities, with which I am inve&s;t|ed, mu&s;t be in perpetual exertion: it is my happi|ne&s;s that they &s;hould be &s;o;&mdash;whil&s;t I &s;oar on high, invi&s;ible to mortals, or vi&s;it every region of the hab|itable world; promoting as much as po&s;&s;ible, its welfare, and defeating the nefarious plots of its en|emies. I boa&s;t not of my powers. Having noth|ing but what I derive from the benificence of Hea|ven.&mdash;Should the Supreme withhold his benign in|fluence, I mu&s;t &s;oon be bereft of all my worth and abilities; even become unworthy the attention of the lovely, amiable children I &s;natched from ruin, and nurtured; who&s;e minds I have formed to vir|tue, and adorned with every valuable accompli&s;h|ment. Let our eyes be ever directed to the author of our exi&s;tence, and from whom we derive every ble&s;&s;ing. Let unfeigned virtue, and true glory be our invariable practice and pur&s;uit. True glory is founded only in the works of benificence and love; in the&s;e it will be impo&s;&s;ible for us to con|tinue, without the &s;acred energy of the glorious Al|mighty Being, who&s;e we are. In him, therefore, let us place the mo&s;t unre&s;erved confidence. His power will &s;upport, his wi&s;dom will direct, his love

will render us compleatly ble&s;&s;ed.&mdash;You, the fir&s;t inhabitants of this fertile and delightful i&s;land.; you only, of all the happy thou&s;ands that have arrived here to live with you as brethren; you, I &s;ay, are the only per&s;ons de&s;titute of female partners for life, and, of con&s;equence, your happine&s;s is far from be|ing compleat. But this mu&s;t be no longer. Take, then, the partners your eyes have already &s;elected. They &s;tand before you. Take, each of you, the fair ones hand you have cho&s;en; their hearts I know, are yours.'&mdash;He cea&s;ed &s;peaking.&mdash;Each man then advanced to the fair orphans, and took the hand he had cho&s;en;&mdash;Nothing loth.&mdash;Ra|venzar then proceeded:&mdash;'One is yet left &s;olitary. My admired, and loved Ge&s;&s;eng, &s;he is yours. I know her to be the choice of your heart.'&mdash;Take then the fair one's hand.&mdash;Ge&s;&s;eng was not long in obeying.&mdash;The attendants were witne&s;&s;es to their mutual vows of con&s;tancy and love, and the Genie pronounced each couple married in the &s;ight of Heaven. Each &s;aluted his bride. The two friends congratulated them, and gave them their ble&s;&s;ing. Their attendants followed their example: and mirth and fe&s;tivity concluded the day, and the evening. The day following, too, was a day of general fea&s;ting and congratulation; and perfect felicity reigned throughout the whole i&s;land; if we except the poor &s;olitary blue-bird, concealed in the grove. All the re&s;t of the birds were hap|py.&mdash;O Prince! could you not have found a place, at lea&s;t, in one of the hall windows, for &s;o lovely and beautiful a bird, who&s;e &s;weet notes out-rivalled all the &s;ong&s;ters of the grove! Ha&s;ten Prince! you can do no le&s;s than carry the merry tidings to your lovely travelling companion. She will welcome you with a thou&s;and care&s;&s;es!&mdash;The truth is, the little blue-bird cho&s;e rather to remain in its retire|ment; and was &s;ufficiently content with vi&s;its from

the Prince, two or three times a day, with &s;ome|thing for it to eat, and the &s;ight of his engaging per|&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e mariages being happily con&s;ummated, the Genie Ravenzar departed; and the newly arrived families being mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ettled in dif|ferent parts of the i&s;land, mo&s;t of them applied them&s;elves to agriculture and manufactures. In|&s;tructors, of both &s;exes, were appointed for the children. A magnificent hall was erected, for pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s. Legi&s;lators were cho&s;en; a council of Elders, and a Pre&s;ident. Laws and regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed. A book of records was kept in the hall chamber. In a word, every thing nece&s;&s;ary, and advantageous, was e&s;tabli&s;hed with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate wi&s;dom. The leading men were of the thirty fir&s;t inhabitants; (who had made large ad|ditions to the knowledge and di&s;cernment they bro't with them into the i&s;land,) and likewi&s;e, of tho&s;e who were from the Empire of China. The be&s;t in&s;tructors were cho&s;en for the youth, from fifteen years of age to twenty&mdash;who were educated in the principles of virtue and liberty, and every art and &s;cience. The grand metropolis was called Xun|tien,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xuntien, alias Pekin. The former name was a|dopted.</NOTE> after that of China. To the hou&s;es of the fir&s;t inhabitants, (who now took their wives home) were added, by the &s;ervants of the Genie, two thou|&s;and, as yet unimproved, being re&s;erved for the Chine&s;e whom Ge&s;&s;eng, (now amba&s;&s;ador to China) was commi&s;&s;ioned to bring in the fleet, which was to &s;ail immediately for that kingdom of &s;plendor.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">A modern name for China, is &s;aid to be Tamin, i. e. the Kingdom of Brightne&s;s.</NOTE> Tho&s;e hou&s;es, with the thirty belonging to the fir&s;t

<P>Ge&s;&s;eng having &s;ailed with the fleet, Prince Ny|tan took a &s;olemn and affectionate leave of his nu|merous friends, a&s;&s;embled in the public hall, in a valedictory addre&s;s, which he concluded with the following &s;olemn and truly intere&s;ting words:&mdash;</P>
<P>'We who are &s;o highly favored&mdash;we, who are &s;o eminently enlightened, can never fail in the re&s;olves we have formed, to &s;eek tho&s;e plea&s;ures to indulge tho&s;e gratificatioas, to pur&s;ue tho&s;e &s;chemes of life only which Heaven approves. Every in|dulgence contrary to this, we well know to be ir|rational, and mu&s;t tend to the &s;ubver&s;sion of the un|paralleled tranquility, health and happine&s;s we en|joy. Heaven's high will is our felicity. Its will therefore mu&s;t be ours, &s;o long as con&s;cious recti|tude of heart is known to in&s;ure our bli&s;s. Yes: rectitude will ever di&s;tingui&s;h and ennoble our ac|tions; the will of the Supreme will be ever our guide.</P>
<P>'Many of us, (in preceding years, in the coun|tries which gave us birth,) have been &s;ated to con|te&s;t with men who would have deprived us of free|dom and en&s;laved our minds. But we have been di|vinely taught to think and act as becomes the free|born children of the Highe&s;t; and our liberties and privileges are here perfectly &s;ecure from inva&s;ion. Let all our actions unchangeably evince our grate|ful hearts.</P>

'Let us be ever pointing out to each other, in every &s;ublime view, the unrivalled beauties of pure virtue, the tran&s;porting plea&s;ures of undi&s;&s;embled love and benevolence, while a &s;trict uniform, invariable temperance, in&s;ures to us all the bli&s;s of which our natures are capable.</P>
<P>'We are now become a nation;&mdash;a nation col|lected indeed, by Divine Providence, from many others;&mdash;a nation trained and di&s;ciplined to real virtue. Such we &s;hall continue, if we cea&s;e not to reverence our&s;elves. For we &s;hall think with a|ver&s;ion and abhorrence of every vice. No more &s;hall any of us glory in infamy and court de&s;truc|tion, as in other countries which cele&s;tial interpo&s;i|tion alone can &s;ave. Alas! to what a plight are &s;ome of them reduced! to what inexplicable mi&s;e|ries are they &s;wiftly ha&s;tening! they are &s;truggling in fires that will &s;hortly con&s;ume them, unle&s;s pre|vented by the kind interference of the gracious pow|er. But I go, citizens to plead with them. I &s;hall remind them of the dignity of their origin; and &s;hew them how beautiful they will look, when adorned with real goodne&s;s. To many I &s;hall &s;ay, (and many I &s;hall convince) the truly happy, worthy and illu&s;trious, are the virtuous, the generous and the benevolent. It is &s;uch the Creator loves, approves and ble&s;&s;es;&mdash;the tender, &s;ympathizing hearts in &s;acred uni&s;on with his own, by virtue &s;weetly form|ed. Many, (I &s;hall &s;ay) have harangued finely on religion, benevolence, humanity, who in the prac|tice of them were errant cowards. And who are more mean and da&s;tardly than tho&s;e, that, with all their fine &s;peeches, pious and benevolent preten&s;ions, be|hold unmoved their fellow-creatures &s;uffering a|round and in the mid&s;t of them; yea, add to their mi&s;eries by their oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures! what kind

of religion is that, without bowels of compa&s;&s;ion? ye vile pretenders to goodne&s;s! &s;hrink and hide your heads forever; or, yet become worthy the human forms ye wear! Whence, (I &s;hall add) whence ari&s;e the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es among mankind, but from the &s;elfi&s;h contemptible tempers of the powerful and rich among you? when we can brave|ly deny our&s;elves to &s;erve the indigent and reclaim the vicious; when we can give up our ardent pur|&s;uits of ambition and &s;en&s;uality, and per&s;evere, a|again&s;t all embarra&s;&s;ments, in promoting the good of every individual, however low and deba&s;ed:&mdash;when we can thus nobly live to the creation, we &s;hall wear, with real honor, the name of men, of a &s;pecious gloriou&s;ly formed, by omnipotence and love, for the true enjoyment of exi&s;tence. But your ignoble ideas, your churli&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, your dete&s;|table pride and vanity, your vices, of every kind, place you below the brutal creation. Nay; the mo&s;t noi&s;ome and loath&s;ome of the inferior tribes of exi&s;tence are far more excellent than you. If there be a &s;park of goodne&s;s buried among you, let it e|merge from the darkne&s;s and ruin in which it hath been &s;o long involved. Awake to real honour and glory! and become brilliant con&s;tellations in the un&s;ullied galaxy of the virtuous &s;ons and daughters of freedom and truth, who&s;e &s;plendors illuminate the world, and are as unfading as the day of Heav|en! Experience the exalted plea&s;ures of undi&s;&s;em|bled virtue and benevolence, and henceforward la|bor to do good, to render others happy. The gen|erous labors of love, while they exalt and refine you for the high and grand enjoyments of immortals, will likewi&s;e add the greate&s;t &s;trength and glory to your national intere&s;ts, and evince, in the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious point of view, how dear they are to Heav|en.'</P>

'In this manner, citizens, &s;hall I inculcate &s;a|cred intere&s;ting truths in the Countries to which I am called. As for us, confirmed as we are in the enjoyment of virtue, freedom and truth, we &s;hall act like tho&s;e who rightly e&s;timate their value: and, re&s;pecting, adoring and loving the benificent author of our being we &s;hall love and re&s;pect each other as the wonderful and glorious workman&s;hip of his hands, reared into exi&s;tence, and clothed with his comeli|ne&s;s, to be ever glorious and amiable in his eyes and in the eyes of each other.

<P>THE king of Per&s;ia at his decea&s;e, having no other child than a daughter, left her the heir of his dominions. She was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;uperior under&s;tanding and incomparable beauty. Her en|gaging manners and &s;hining accompli&s;hments had attracted univer&s;al love and re&s;pect. It was, there|fore, with univer&s;al &s;ati&s;faction the people &s;aw her a&s;cend the throne of Per&s;ia. Every day &s;he gave fre&s;h proofs of her &s;uperior talents, wi&s;dom and prudence, and though &s;carce two and twenty, her illu&s;trious actions rai&s;ed her a fame beyond any of her predece&s;&s;ors; and drew to her court, princes of the neighbouring kingdoms, who &s;olicited her hand; but in vain. Her affections being engaged, &s;he had neither a hand nor a heart to yield them. Tho&s;e princes, therefore, gave over their &s;olicitations, and returned home with di&s;appointment and chagrin. One of them carried his re&s;entment &s;o far, as to enter the Queen's dominions with a great army, which &s;pread ruin and deva&s;tation wherever it advan|ced. The Queen oppo&s;ed this de&s;troying power with all the force &s;he could rai&s;e in an emergency &s;o &s;udden and unexpected. But victory was decid|ing in favor of her enemy, when Prince Nytan ar|rived on the confines of her dominions, where he

&s;oon became informed of tho&s;e unju&s;t and cruel dep|redations. 'I mu&s;t go, &s;aid he to his blue-bird, and cha&s;ti&s;e this invader, if Heaven conde&s;cends, to aid my arm.' 'Go, replied the blue-bird, and when you have &s;ucceeded, marry the Queen of Per|&s;ia, and bring her hither, that I may &s;ee a Prince&s;s of whom I heard &s;o much talk. I &s;hall wait impa|tiently for you, and may pro&s;perity attend you.' 'Ah! fair and beautiful bird! (if &s;uch thou really art) I &s;hall have no fancy to marry any Queens, whil&s;t I can enjoy thy &s;weet company. What bird ever &s;ang, ever talked like thee? I was never half &s;o well entertained and charmed!' Such was the Prince's return to the blue-bird; which he had long before conjectured to be more than a mere bird; though who, or what, he was &s;till at a lo&s;s. 'Well, rejoined the blue-bird, dear flattering Prince! ha&s;|ten away to the &s;uccour of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and re|turn quickly to the bird who be&s;t loves you.' 'If &s;o, returned he, I have the highe&s;t rea&s;on to be &s;ati&s;|fied. But, tell me mo&s;t accompli&s;hed lady!

In my ab&s;ence, (which I hope will be but a few hours) three young women will attend you, whom I have bribed largely to be faithful to the tru&s;t I have re|po&s;ed in them.'&mdash;What is all this fine &s;peech to a poor little blue-bird? exclaimed the bird. How|ever take me, if you plea&s;e to the apartment you have provided for me.'

Thus &s;aying &s;he flew out of her window, and the Prince &s;aw her enter that of her new apartment.' Therefore, fixing his magic &s;pear in its place, directed towards the field of war, which he had reconnoitred with his gla&s;s, his chamber mounted aloft in the air, and its &s;plendors glittered to the &s;un.</P>
<P>When Prince Nytan was arrived to the martial field, he found the Per&s;ians almo&s;t vanqui&s;hed and &s;urrounded by the enemy. With &s;word in hand he &s;oon fought his way through the thicke&s;t of his op|po&s;ers; joined and rallied the Per&s;ian army, and in le&s;s than an hour, obtained a compleat victory; taking the Prince, and twenty thou&s;and pri&s;oners.&mdash;'Go, &s;aid the victorious &s;on of Renien to the captive Prince, and by afflictions, learn humanity and virtue.

nece&s;&s;ary; while, at the &s;ame time, they are ren|dered glorious to me, only as an in&s;trument in the hand of the uncontrouled Sovereign of the Univer&s;e, to bring good out of evil.

When you have been taught to think with me, we &s;hall perhaps, meet again.' Having &s;aid thus, a|greeable to Ravenzar's coun&s;el, he ordered the roy|al pri&s;oner to be chained in a dark room, and, treat|ed as a madman, till the public affairs of Per&s;ia were &s;ettled. Then he was to be bani&s;hed human &s;ociety, and conveyed into a va&s;t fore&s;t, far di&s;tant from the kingdom, which, by his manners, he had di&s;graced and forfeited. 'We take no lives, added the hero; nor hath one been lo&s;t.

<P>Having ordered the numerous pri&s;oners, to be con|fined, and guarded, till it &s;hould be determined in council, in what manner they were to be di&s;po&s;ed of; Prince Nytan ha&s;tened to &s;eek the Queen.&mdash;But no queen was to be found. This cau&s;ed a great alarm, and excited the deepe&s;t concern. For the queen Selina, was loved by all, almo&s;t to adoration. She had gone abroad on pretence of hunting and retured not. Her attendants, &s;uddenly mi&s;&s;ing her, &s;earched every where in vain;&mdash;returned to the pal|ace with the melancholy tidings;&mdash;with great num|bers they went back to the fore&s;t renewing their &s;earch after their Queen; in which they were conti|nally employed. The a&s;toni&s;hed hero di&s;patched a &s;till greater number on the &s;ame important errand; and taking leave of the officers of the army, only for the night, ha&s;tened to his expecting bird. 'Wel|come,

brave Nytan! I &s;ee victory triumphs in your countenance: and yet &s;omething appears to di&s;turb you. How is the Queen of Per&s;ia?' 'Alas replied he, I know not. The Queen is mi&s;&s;ing, and no where to be found. Early mu&s;t I go in que&s;t of her.'&mdash;'Hardly &s;o, an&s;wered the voice of one en|tering the apartment. The Prince turned and be|held the Fairy of the i&s;land of pictures advancing to the blue-bird which de&s;cended from the corner of a &s;offa, (where it was &s;itting) to meet her. Be|fore that Prince Nytan had time to &s;peak, the fairy Perieng, touched the bird gently with her wand. She had no &s;ooner &s;poken, when, in&s;tead of a little blue-bird, a mo&s;t charming lady, and of a maje&s;tic countenance, appeared before them, arrayed in a robe of &s;ky-blue &s;atin, and her head adorned with a crown of gold and diamonds!&mdash;'There cried the Fairy Perieng, is the Queen you would go in que&s;t of. Carry home to her palace and marry her. But &s;tay, on &s;econd thought, I will go with you. Fetch hither thy chamber. For this purpo&s;e, am I come to give you Queen Selina in marriage, and to make merry with you on &s;o happy on occa&s;ion. Let us ha&s;ten, then to put and end to the grief of the mo&s;t loyal &s;ubjects, who deplore their beloved Queen as lo&s;t.' Nytan &s;oon brought his chamber to the Fairy and Queen; who entering with him, they were in a minute, at the gate of the Queen's palace. When the Queen appeared before her hou&s;ehold and tho&s;e of the nobility and ladies, who were at the palace, their joy was unbounded! The glad tidings &s;oon circulated far and wide, and thou&s;ands flocked to the palace to ble&s;s their eyes with a &s;ight of their beloved Queen who&s;e ab&s;ence they had &s;o deeply regretted, and whom they had almo&s;t given over as irrecoverably lo&s;t! The Queen conducted her vic|torious hero and lover, with the fairy Perieng, to
<PB N="95" REF="038495_0094_10122D294B06E428">
her great hall, and placed them on her throne. The hall was immediately crowded with the nobility and ladies, and va&s;t numbers of others, congratulating their Queen, and be&s;towing a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings on Prince Nytan, who &s;at by her &s;ide. The dignity, maje&s;ty, and benevolence that &s;hone forth in the countenance of the fairy Perieng excited their pro|founde&s;t re&s;pect and e&s;teem. They bowed to the ground before her; when, ri&s;ing from her &s;eat, &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed the numerous and joyful a&s;&s;embly.&mdash;'My worthy and re&s;pected friends! In the hero before you, I pre&s;ent you the &s;on of Renien, &s;ove|reign of the va&s;t Empire of China; the illu&s;trious &s;on, of an illu&s;trious father, who has been, &s;o many years, every where celebrated for wi&s;dom, virtue, bril|liant accompli&s;hments an dinnumerable great and be|nevolent actions. The &s;on is worthy to &s;hare, with your Queen; the throne of Per&s;ia; your Queen, an ine&s;timable gift of Heaven to you, and the man who found worthy of her hand. That man is the valorous Prince before you,&mdash;Prince Nytan, who in one happy moment, has turned away de&s;truction from your kindom, and re&s;tored to you your belov|ed Queen. They have &s;ometime loved, though un|known to each other; however my&s;terious my words may appear to you. Superior powers direct|ed their de&s;tiny. Since, then, it is the will of the Supreme, let their hands be united, who&s;e hearts are already one. And, long may they live, under the guidance of Heaven, to diffu&s;e ble&s;&s;ings through Per&s;ia; and far and wide wherever their influence is, in future times, to extend.' The &s;peech of the fairy Perieng was received with univer&s;al approba|tion, and acclamations of joy. The marriage was, that day, &s;olemnized; and great rejoicings were made throughout the kingdom, with fea&s;tings, which la&s;ted a whole month. Prince Nytan's wonderful

chamber was placed on a plea&s;ant hill in the Queen's garden, in a grove, till his further occa&s;ions &s;hould call for it. But, that which was very &s;urpri&s;ing to the Prince, was, to find the Queen's palace and garden exactly like tho&s;e at Ravenzar. The apart|ments of the palace, the courts, the avenues;&mdash;in a word, he could find nothing about the palace and gardens, within or without but what, was as much like tho&s;e in Ravenzar, as if the one was copi|ed from the other. So that when the Queen introduced him to the chamber for his private re|tirement, he imagined him&s;elf &s;uddenly and in&s;en|&s;ibly tran&s;ported to his own in the i&s;land. Like|wi&s;e, when he entered the clo&s;et, and looked out of the window, and viewed the lovely pro&s;pect, he coudl not refrain crying out to the Queen, 'Why, Selina, can you explain to me the&s;e phenomena. Am I in my own palace, or am I not? if not, never was there, in every thing, &s;o perfect a re&s;em|blance. The chamber, its furniture, the clo&s;et, books, garden, hills, groves, and the whole pro&s;pect, have the mo&s;t perfect likene&s;s! How can all this po&s;&s;ibly be? 'I can account for the&s;e wonderful things, (an&s;wered the fairy Perieng, entering the clo&s;et) much better, I believe, than your Queen. It is the work of Ravenzar, who fore&s;eeing every thing, ordered his &s;ervants to build, and fini&s;h off your palace and gardens exactly like tho&s;e of your Selina; that you who &s;o greatly re&s;emble her in per&s;on and accompli&s;hments, might re&s;emble her in every thing el&s;e.' 'How much replied the Prince, am I in all things obliged to that great and good Genie! one might be almo&s;t ready to think, continued the Prince, that Ravenzar was as much in love with Selina&mdash;'As who? interrupted the fai|ry, I hope you are not going to be jealous. How|every, it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that one who has been in love,

and who takes &s;uch infinite plea&s;ure in obliging his friends, mu&s;t well know the delight lovers take in forming every thing to each other's fancy. And, as the Queen's palace, and garden's were unrivalled in beauty and perfection, how could he better oblige you both than by taking care, that tho&s;e of yours &s;hould want in nothing of the original from which they are copied?' 'Dear fairy, returned Prince Nytan, you inflame my love and gratitude, to my worthy benefactor to the highe&s;t pitch.' 'Well, re|joined the fairy Perieng, I fore&s;ee, it will not be a great many months, before Queen Selina's curio&s;i|ty will conduct her to Ravenzar, that &s;he may ex|amine with her own eyes &s;o perfect a copy of her own ta&s;te in building and laying out magnificent gardens. For, I can a&s;&s;ure you, that all you find here, was built and compleated by her own direc|tions. Her father's buildings being old and de|cayed, all was renewed, and the gardens enlarged and laid out as you &s;ee them. Be&s;ides, the more you &s;hall examine, the greater will be your convic|tion of the perfect likene&s;s.'</P>
<P>They &s;at down at the clo&s;et window, and con|ver&s;ed a great while, on the beauties of the pro&s;pect and the grand and magnificent appearance of the di&s;tant mountains. Here they examined four ca&s;|kets, who&s;e contents were of immen&s;e value in jew|els and intere&s;ting papers. They were pre&s;ents from the fairy, containing memoirs, delightful, en|tertaining and in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>The fairy Perieng, having &s;pent above a month with the new married pair, and &s;een Prince Ny|tan e&s;tabli&s;hed, with Queen Selina, in the throne of Per&s;ia; bid them and the court adieu, and returned to her i&s;land; promi&s;ing to vi&s;it them often, where|ever their happy de&s;tiny &s;hould &s;tation them.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="038495_0097_10122D2F2BD2A4A8">
The generous attention, of this royal pair, to the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the kingdom of Per&s;ia, was &s;oon manife&s;ted in numberle&s;s acts of genero&s;ity and humanity, and the effects of the wi&s;e&s;t policy were felt and enjoyed by every individual through|out the kingdom. The poore&s;t of their &s;ubjects were con&s;idered, and treated by them as their own children. This conduct lays the only &s;ure founda|tion for the happine&s;s of kingdoms, &s;tates, or com|monwealths; when that attention to the lowe&s;t cla&s;|&s;es in &s;ociety, and to the wants and morals of the poore&s;t, is paid, which unfeigned humanity dictates, in oppo&s;ition to the covetous di&s;po&s;ition, which fal&s;e ideas and fal&s;e ta&s;tes have rendered &s;o univer&s;ally prevalent. Such an attention, &s;o becoming men of genius, wealth or power, meet with the approbation of Heaven, and en&s;ure true glory and felicity. Such an attention is the never failing fruit of real virtue and benevolence: and without it, no nation &s;hall long flouri&s;h. The want of it has ever been 'followed, and ever will be by the decline and ruin of the be&s;t &s;tates or kingdoms.&mdash;Such were the &s;en|timents entertained by Nytan and Selina, the &s;ove|reigns of Per&s;ia; and to which all their actions con|&s;tantly agreed. To render every cla&s;s, and every individual of &s;ociety indu&s;trious, virtuous and hap|py, their efforts were unremitted. And as to &s;o benevolent and noble a purpo&s;e, they &s;pared no pains, &s;o likewi&s;e, they withheld no co&s;t or expence. They journeyed through their dominions, enquired into the circum&s;tances of every one, and &s;upplied ev|ery want. They appointed weekly fea&s;ts and alms for the poor and helple&s;s; and per&s;ons, worthy of &s;acred tru&s;t, to look after them, and afford them ev|ery a&s;&s;i&s;tance, every convenience, every in&s;truction. Such in&s;tances of cele&s;tial humanity and love to mankind were never before exhibited with half the

&s;incerity, and per&s;evering attention. Per&s;ia &s;carce ever knew what felicity and pro&s;perity were, be|fore this happy aera! or &s;aw, as now, crowned heads fea&s;ting with the poore&s;t and meane&s;t of their &s;ub|jects! this was a glory re&s;erved for Nytan and Se|lina! every heart loved them; Every tongue ble&s;|&s;ed them, and cried, O cele&s;tial king and Queen! Live forever! Here all the public affairs were tran&s;acted with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate &s;kill and wi&s;|dom. All officers were diligent and faithful. For true and able men were appointed to every office, in every department. All in&s;tructors were as &s;in|cere as learned, and as faithful as wi&s;e; &s;elected from the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and mo&s;t bevolent. But as the royal philanthropi&s;ts were of too great value and too much wanted in the world, to remain always in one kingdom; and as the time drew nigh when they were to vi&s;it other regions, and in&s;truct the citizens of other nations in true wi&s;dom and hap|pine&s;s, they became indefatigable in making pro|vi&s;ion for the future peace and &s;ecurity of Per&s;ia. Seminaries were founded; and the king had pro|cured a number of Genies to pre&s;ide over them. Nothing was omitted, by the royal pair, that could conduce to the happine&s;s of the kingdom in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the &s;overeignty. The fine&s;t pieces were wrote, both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, embelli&s;hed and enforced with all the beauties, elegancies, and pathos of the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, in prai&s;e and commendation of every virtue, and of the &s;tudy of the works of the glorious and benifi|cent creator, and in commendation of arts and &s;ci|ences, agriculture, indu&s;try, &s;ocial and dome&s;tic happine&s;s. The&s;e were publi&s;hed, and di&s;tributed gratis, in every family, be&s;ides thou&s;ands of copies being for &s;ale, in every great town or city. A great many noble examples enforced every precept and
<PB N="100" REF="038495_0099_10123FB3534F5C00">
in&s;truction, and with a charming authority, every argument. The adorers of fire were no where to be found, in tho&s;e happy days; but the true knowl|edge of, and re&s;pect to the Deity, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> admira|bly influential throughout all Per&s;ia. The ladies of highe&s;t rank, and the nobility were virtuous, gen|erous, and exemplary. See, ye great! what hap|pine&s;s ye may diffu&s;e! and learn what it is to be truly great and illu&s;trious; to be worthy of life and all its rich variety of ble&s;&s;ings! the amiable Queen had done wonders in training up her &s;ubjects to virtue and happine&s;s, &s;o that the work of reformation became the ea&s;ier, e&s;pecially when two &s;uch great minds, as her own and her royal hu&s;band's, acted in concert, &s;econded, too, with the cheerful and unremit|ted co|operation of great numbers of the highe&s;t order.</P>
<P>As for the royal pri&s;oner, he was committed to the hands of a genie, who took plea&s;ure in fulfilling the commands of Nytan, ever tending to accompli&s;h both public and private good. The pri&s;oner, then, was borne away by invi&s;ible hands to a far di&s;tant wilderne&s;s, and there left a &s;olitary and de&s;er|ted heing; yet &s;till under the eye of the invi&s;i|ble genie, who&s;e name was Pharenon, and who took care, with &s;everal occa&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tants, like him&s;elf invi&s;ible and unperceived, to pre&s;erve him from the fury of the wild bea&s;ts of the de&s;ert. After he had worn out his clothes, he wondered about naked, his intellects for the mo&s;t part being deranged, &s;o that he &s;carce knew what he did, living upon any thing he chanced to find except that now and then, &s;ome|thing better than the de&s;ert afforded was thrown in his way, by means of Pharenon. One day towards its clo&s;e, as he was wandering, perfectly naked, a company of Banditti came upon him; who, after diverting them&s;elves with him awhile, tied him up by his hands to the limb of a tree, beat him
<PB N="101" REF="038495_0100_101224E1E9F70EA8">
cruelly, and left him hanging. Night came on He was near expiring. Two hungry lions ru&s;hed from the thickets, and made the wilderne&s;s re&s;ound with their tremendous roaring. They were ju&s;t upon tearing in pieces the naked and helple&s;s prey, when the Genie Pharenon appeared in a flame of fire! The lions in&s;tantly fled. The benevolent and compa&s;&s;ionate Genie, a&s;&s;uming the form of a young man, untied the naked &s;ufferer, laid him on the ground, and forced down his throat a cordial, at which he revived from a fit of fainting. He then anointed him all over with an healing &s;pecific oint|ment, wrapped him in &s;heets which he had ordered to be brought, and conveyed him, from the woods to a hou&s;e, where he was put in bed, and &s;erved with things nece&s;&s;ary and comfortable. The Genie could not refrain weeping over him, and exclaiming&mdash;'It is enough ill-fated Prince! thy &s;ufferings and di&s;|grace are at an end! thy mind hath been &s;ufficient|ly exerci&s;ed, and will pre&s;ently appear refined, like gold from the furnace. Be comforted, happy days are before thee! here you will want for nothing, and when capable of ea&s;y travelling, you will be conducted to a more agreable man&s;ion.' The Prince expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude to Heaven, and to Pharenon for his kindne&s;s. 'I am now in&s;tructed, &s;aid the Prince, to be humane; and I hope the in&s;truction will not be lo&s;t upon me and that I &s;hall live to be grateful.' Pharenon was as good as his word to the Prince. As &s;oon as he was capable of travel|ling, he removed him by ea&s;y &s;tages, to a palace he owned in that country; nor failed of any kind of|fice. In his hands he remained till he was perfect|ly recovered.</P>
<P>When the royal and illu&s;trious pair were acquaint|ed, by Pharenon, of the mi&s;eries to which the un|fortunate Prince had been &s;ubjected, (though their
<PB N="102" REF="038495_0101_10122D32D7CB4730">
&s;ource was his ungovernable pa&s;&s;ions) they neither could refrain from weeping, notwith&s;tanding they were acquainted with his happier &s;ituation. Such were their &s;ympathi&s;ing feelings for the human race. All indeed were grieved for his &s;ufferings, and re|joiced to find they were ended; that he was in &s;uch good hands, and that there was rea&s;on to hope he would now render him&s;elf worthy, who was once &s;o de&s;picable, and become, in future, a ble&s;&s;ing and ornament to his country. Their hopes were not di&s;appointed. After continuing a year with Phare|non, he was re&s;tored to his family and kingdom. the twenty thou&s;and pri&s;oners were &s;ent home, full of the prai&s;es of Nytan and Selina, and of the un|precedented kind and generous u&s;age they had ex|perienced. Their Prince now became the father and benefactor of his people, reformed, to the ut|mo&s;t, every thing ami&s;s. In a few months after his re&s;toration, he vi&s;ited the Per&s;ian court, where he was cordially received, and entertained with that re&s;pect and magnificence which none but &s;uch as Nytan and Selina knew how to exhibit.</P>
<P>Nytan had paid &s;everal vi&s;its to the confines of Per&s;ia, where he had purcha&s;ed him&s;elf an hou&s;e, and &s;ome lands, with the de&s;ign of &s;ettling upon the lands a greater number of poor people, that could &s;carcely get bread to eat. This de&s;ign he accom|pli&s;hed, and left the poor people, in a fair way of improvement in virtuous indu&s;try; intending ma|ny of them for Ravenzar. To people that i&s;land with valuable citizens, and to &s;ow the &s;eeds of vir|tue in the hearts of men. He now &s;et out for Eu|rope, bidding adieu to his Queen, and the court. They were much affected at the thought of parting. For the king &s;oon but an end to their grief by tel|ling his lovely queen and all pre&s;ent that they had no cau&s;e for parting with him &s;o reluctantly; that
<PB N="103" REF="038495_0102_10122D3517D17538">
he was going on Heaven's errands; and knew his own &s;afety and theirs; likewi&s;e, that by means of his expeditious mode of travelling, he &s;hould be of|tener with them than they were imagining. Thus all tears were dried up, and they parted in good &s;pirits!</P>
<P>King Nytan had been now about 13 months al|mo&s;t wholly in the court and kingdom of Per&s;ia. By means of Pharenon, he had heard from the Em|peror his father, and the court of Pekin. His &s;i&s;|ters were married to the worthy mandarins; who, with the Emperor and Empre&s;s, were in good health. Under the influence of a wi&s;e and good &s;overeign, virtue and indu&s;try generally prevailed; which was the more extraordinary con&s;idering of what an immne&s;e body of people the Chine&s;e empire is compo&s;ed. There being no le&s;s than three hun|dred millions under the government of one man. They allow of no emba&s;&s;ies but from Ravenzar. As amba&s;&s;ador Ge&s;&s;eng had been there; from whom, on his return, Nytan had received letters informing him of his arrival with two thou&s;and families, of the health of every one, and that all things were pro&s;perous; nothing being capable of adding to their felicity, but his pre&s;ence. The king having an&s;wered Ge&s;&s;eng, and &s;ent away his letters, &s;et out for Europe, where his chamber &s;oon re&s;ted, on the borders of a va&s;t fore&s;t; not far from which was a flouri&s;hing city. Leaving his chamber, rendered invi&s;ible and inacce&s;&s;able, he travelled on foot, to the city, and entered one of the be&s;t inns, which was crowded with company. He introduced him&s;elf as a foreigner, making the tour of Europe. Ingra|tiating him&s;elf with the company, he &s;oon learned all he wanted to know. In the morning, hiring hor&s;es, and a &s;ervant, he rode on to the next city, and put up at the inn mo&s;t frequented by the citi|zens, and by travellers. He walked alone, and pon|dered
<PB N="104" REF="038495_0103_10122D37BA3FAAB8">
on what adventures might await him in this new &s;cene. 'Have I &s;aid he to him&s;elf, exchanged my happy &s;ituation for the&s;e cities, where par|ties &s;trive and rage, and every dire form of wicked|ne&s;s &s;talks at noon day. De&s;titute of acquaintance and friend to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t. But I correct my|&s;elf. A friend I have; and one of infinitely more value than the wi&s;e&s;t, the be&s;t, the lovelie&s;t the mo&s;t powerful and mo&s;t faithful of all I have left behind.&mdash;A friend, though invi&s;ible, yet ever pre&s;ent and ever ready to aid. O how dared I to indulge a &s;in|gle de&s;ponding thought, &s;ince the be&s;tower of friends is mine. O let me never again a moment forget my friend omnipotent and omnipre&s;ent, in who&s;e &s;ervice too, I am engaged. I will walk, and &s;ee what adventure will greet me.' He was &s;oon in|formed a war ju&s;t commenced between that and the neighbouring kingdom. He enquired into the merits of their controver&s;y, introduced him&s;elf to the princi|pal men; entered a volunteer in the &s;ervice; and e|quipping him&s;elf as a &s;oldier, was received at head quarters. The occa&s;ion of the war appeared to be ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. He was &s;oon promoted; di&s;|covering &s;uch wi&s;dom, prudence and valor, as en|deared him to the whole army in that country. In a word, he became chiefly in&s;trumental in gaining a &s;peedy and deci&s;ive victory, and peace on the mo&s;t ju&s;t and honorable terms. While in the army, he was &s;ucce&s;sful in correcting and reforming many errors in di&s;cipline, (for he had &s;tudied war as well as peace) and reforming &s;everal vicious officers. His pre&s;ence every where excited, in the minds of men, the ju&s;te&s;t notions of the dignity of human nature. He commanded univer&s;al re&s;pect, e&s;teem and love. With &s;everal he formed an agreeable friend&s;hip. In the metropolis, he was received with the honours he merited. The monarch em|braced

him, and clo&s;eted him for &s;everal days. He found the king to be highly accompli&s;hed, and at|tentive to the intere&s;ting &s;ubjects on which Nytan conver&s;ed: that on which he mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted was of the nece&s;&s;ity of a greater attention's being paid to the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es in &s;ociety. He rea&s;oned with &s;uch ju&s;tne&s;s and energy, that the monarch's eyes were opened to &s;cenes of national happine&s;s, which he had before imagined could never be reali&s;ed. He re&s;olved, therefore, upon new &s;chemes for the pro&s;|perity and happine&s;s of his kingdom.</P>
<P>Having performed the&s;e important &s;ervices he re|turned to his chamber, where he pa&s;&s;ed two days and nights in contemplation, and re&s;t from his in|ce&s;&s;ant exertions for the good of his fellow creatures. Solitary as the hermit, he prepared his own meals; and walked in the day-time, with a book, under the &s;hades of the fore&s;t. He feared no banditti, or &s;av|age invaders, having it in his power, by his art, to pre&s;erve both him&s;elf and his chamber from the rav|ages of wild bea&s;ts, or the &s;ons of violence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There he &s;ervently implored Heaven's guidance in his future actions.</NOTE> On the third day, he cau&s;ed his chamber to a&s;cend, and in a few minutes, was in his garden in Per&s;ia. The Queen was ju&s;t ri&s;en, and opening her window, be|held her beloved lord advancing from the grove. She quickly de&s;cended the &s;tair ca&s;e, and ran into his arms! words fall to expre&s;s the joy of the loving pair!&mdash;I have but just called, &s;aid King Nytan, to &s;ee how you do, and then I mu&s;t away again to Europe, where I have &s;carcely done half my allotted work.' 'One day, at lea&s;t, my dear lord!' replied the Queen.' 'No my Selina, it cannot be, returned the king: at noon I mu&s;t leave you. Let us retire
<PB N="106" REF="038495_0105_10122D3BF0E5AB70">
unnoticed, to your apartment, or rather to my clo&s;|et; where you mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me in chu&s;ing &s;ome books I mean to carry with me. Let breakfa&s;t be order|ed there. I &s;hall be with you, a few hours; and I would be unnoticed by more than one or two &s;er|vants, that I may not be too long hindered from my return. I &s;hall order matters &s;o that this will be my la&s;t journey to Europe, at lea&s;t for &s;ome years. Then my lovely Selina, I hope to give my&s;elf up to you at Ravenzar, for &s;everal months.' Before noon, Pharenon brought a packet of letters from the African monarch, which gave them a va&s;t deal of plea&s;ure. That monarch had greatly improved his &s;ubjects, and expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude to Nytan in the warme&s;t terms; who had but ju&s;t time enough to return his an&s;wer, by the Genie. He embraced Se|lina, who attended him to his flying chamber. She left not the hill, till the chamber, a&s;cending the &s;kies, and traver&s;ing the airy regions, was out of &s;ight. The Queen excu&s;ed to her hou&s;ehold and the court, &s;o &s;ecret and ha&s;ty a vi&s;it from her lord, on account of the nece&s;&s;ity he was under of di&s;patching his af|fairs in Europe, that he might return to them the &s;ooner, to lay before them matters of great moment, which concerned their future welfare. Nytan now &s;pent near eight weeks in travelling through other parts of Europe than tho&s;e he had vi&s;ited.&mdash;His time was wholly employed with the poore&s;t pea&s;ants, at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from cities and large towns. A|mong them he di&s;tributed the books, with which he had loaded his chamber. They were in the lan|guage of the country in which they lived. The king was perpetually giving them good advice and in&s;truction. He &s;ettled them on good farms, which he purcha&s;ed. He &s;elected &s;uch per&s;ons as he &s;ound mo&s;t capable of receiving good councils, and profit|ing by them in a more comfortable &s;ituation of life.
<PB N="107" REF="038495_0106_10122D3D84A0B528">
Of the&s;e, he had under his tuition, about twelve thou&s;and, in different parts of Europe. Among them were a number of in&s;tructors, to whom the royal philanthropi&s;t was very much attached, on ac|count of their virtues and good under&s;tandings. He &s;upplied them with books, as likewi&s;e a number of fe|males, who merited his attention, as capable of the greate&s;t improvements.</P>
<P>The&s;e great things being &s;o far happily accom|pli&s;hed, the king bade his &s;ocieties farewell. A thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings followed him to his travelling chamber; which he now &s;aw fit to render vi&s;ible. The pea&s;ants, with wondering eyes, beheld it a&s;cend in the air, and convey their benefactor to di&s;tant re|gions.</P>
<P>It was night when he arrived at his palace in Per|&s;ia. He went directly to his apartment and &s;olaced him&s;elf in the arms of his lovely Queen.</P>
<P>In the morning the king pre&s;ented him&s;elf to his people, and appointed a number of the nobility, and plebians to attend him, and the Queen, on a tour through the kingdom. The plea&s;ure and joy of their loving &s;ubjects, wherever they appeared, can &s;carely be de&s;cribed, on the one hand; and on the other, their grief, when they acquainted them of their propo&s;ed departure, from Per&s;ia. The lat|ter was only mitigated by their promi&s;e of vi&s;iting them as often as po&s;&s;ible, and providing &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the throne who would in every thing, follow their examples. The la&s;t was fulfilled without delay, on their return from the tour. Rave&s;co and Fatima, were crowned and proclaimed king and queen of Per&s;ia. Their known virtues and accompli&s;hments render|ed them highly acceptable, and their whole conduct ever gave univer&s;al &s;atisfation. Nytan and Selina now prepared for their departure. The Queen would carry nothing away, excepting a few things
<PB N="108" REF="038495_0107_10122D4027E1D6C0">
nece&s;&s;ary and convenient: and would allow of but one maid and one man &s;ervant to attend them Re|lations &s;he had none, though numbers of dear friends, with whom &s;he know not how to part. Nytan how|ever adju&s;ted that affecting circum&s;tance to her &s;at|isfaction, by propo&s;ing that tho&s;e to whom &s;he was mo&s;t attached, &s;hould, after a while, be tran&s;ported to Ravenzar.</P>
<P>On the morning of their departure, the palace, courts, and gardens were crowded with weeping &s;pectators. Nytan and Selina, from the hill lifted up their hands and ble&s;&s;ed them; and, entering the aerial vehicle, &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of Per&s;ia, and their di&s;con&s;olate friends! &s;uch indeed were the whole kingdom! men, women, and children, every where, with &s;ighs and tears, bewailed the lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained, in a king and queen, who loved them as they were beloved! but &s;uch alas! are the chan|ges and vici&s;&s;itudes of human life! in which we are only relieved by the lively expectation of a &s;tate of higher, of con&s;ummate perfections where no chan|ges can effect even a momentary grief!&mdash;So rapid was their voyage to the i&s;land of Ravenzar; &s;o &s;ud|den their exchange of one country of friends for an|other; that whil&s;t the Per&s;ians were lamenting their lo&s;s, and returning with tears and &s;ighs to their re|&s;pective abodes, the citizens of Ravenzar were re|joicing and congratulating them on their arrival there! Nytan and Selina had now di&s;robed and di|ve&s;ted them&s;elves of the en&s;igns and honors of roy|alty, and were become only members of the com|munity of Ravenzar. But, their great accompli&s;h|ments, their &s;hining virtues, their unparalleled mod|e&s;ty and &s;weetne&s;s of behaviour, procured them a ven|eration and love, an e&s;teem and honor, which few crowned heads, in any age or country, were ever capable of commanding; and which daily increa&s;ed
<PB N="109" REF="038495_0108_10122D4243AF92B0">
as they progre&s;&s;ed in life;&mdash;like rivers, enlarging as they flow on from their &s;ource, enriching their banks on either &s;ide, till they mingle with the va&s;t expan&s;e of waters!</P>
<P>But, left it &s;hould be imagined, that Selina's vir|tues po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that degree of refinement e&s;&s;ential to the rendering her fame as pure and unfullied as it hath been exhibited; in that &s;he was unju&s;tifiable in retiring from her invaded country, to confine her|&s;elf with a Prince with whom &s;he had become en|amoured merely from the de&s;cription and repre&s;en|tations given of him by the fairy Perieng; it &s;hould be related, that the queen was governed by that wi&s;e and good fairy, who knew what was to happen; and who &s;aw no harm in transforming a fair lady for awhile, into a beautiful blue-bird.</P>
<P>Ge&s;&s;eng was &s;itting with his lovely partner, at one of the palace windows, which looked into the garden, when the chamber de&s;cended to its wonted &s;tation in the retired grove. They &s;oon beheld its dazzling &s;plendors; and &s;at not gazing till it became &s;tationary on its flowery lawn, and vi&s;ible only to the &s;ong&s;ters of the wood. In&s;tantly they left their &s;eats, and Olivia her pencil and drawings. They ob&s;erved two unknown per&s;ons, (as they glanced their eyes through the &s;tairca&s;e window, in their de&s;cent) emerge from the grove. But, as they al|ways appeared in a becoming dre&s;s for company, they had no new arrangements to make, on the &s;core of dre&s;s. They therefore immediately ran out in que&s;t of their friend and benefactor, whom they had no doubt of finding returned. How great was their &s;urpri&s;e to &s;ee him leading up the alley a beautiful lady, attended by a man and maid &s;ervant; as they now di&s;cerned them to be, whom they glanced at from the &s;tair ca&s;e window! As Nytan and Selina
<PB N="110" REF="038495_0109_10122D43ED79F3D8">
approached, they &s;oon perceived how matters were;&mdash;the intimate union of the happy pair was vi&s;ible in their countenances!&mdash;Joy! cried Ge&s;&s;eng, and ran into the welcome arms of his friend.&mdash;'All hail! lovely pair,' exclaimed gayly, the e|qually lovely partner of Ge&s;&s;eng, and embraced Seli|na. Their embraces were renewed with &s;weete&s;t congratulations! The dome&s;tics gathered round them, and followed them into the hall. Selina thought &s;he was in that in Per&s;ia! The news of their arrival made a rapid progre&s;s through the city, and the palace was &s;oon crouded. Meanwhile, Nytan led his Selina through the palace, and up to his chamber and clo&s;et. She was filled with &s;ur|pri&s;e, admiration and delight, in ob&s;erving the per|fect re&s;emblance of every thing to the palace and gardens &s;he left in Per&s;ia. 'Why, cried &s;he, have I been travelling, in a few minutes all over the world, and now find my&s;elf on a &s;udden, in my own palace, when I imagined my&s;elf to be di&s;tanc|ed from it thou&s;ands of miles? What wonders are the&s;e?'&mdash;'What wonders? replied Nytan, you are indeed in your own palace; and you be|held from the window your own gardens. Is all this &s;o &s;trange?&mdash;'If I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch hap|pine&s;s, I owe it to the kinde&s;t of men! re|turned Selina.'&mdash;'O my incomparable Selina! ex|claimed the enraptured hu&s;band, what infinite ob|ligations am I under to be ever kind, tender and affectionate to the fir&s;t of women! all I am all I ever &s;hall be are thine&mdash;forever thine! May Hea|ven daily and hourly increa&s;e the power of Nytan to render him&s;elf worthy of its ine&s;timable gift! as the happy years roll on, the charms of Selina &s;hall receive new lu&s;tre, and every day add to the felicities of her life! Every &s;ucceeding hour &s;hall in|crea&s;e the tenderne&s;s and affection of the happie&s;t of
<PB N="111" REF="038495_0110_10122D4613344280">
men! may that of his Selina be ever equal to her worth! it will then be complete and permanent.' He would perhaps, have exhau&s;ted him&s;elf in the ef|fu&s;ions of love and gratitude, had not the appear|ance of Ge&s;&s;eng, and the &s;houts of the people arre&s;t|ed his attention. He went down into the hall, and mingled embraces with his congratulating friends. Joy and gladne&s;s circulated throughout the i&s;land of Ravenzar. None could be greater. None could be more &s;incere. Nytan propo&s;ed, to his numer|ous friends, an entertainment, the next day at his own expence, in the city hall. Accordingly, there a grand fe&s;tival was celebrated; when the wonders of Ravenzar were commemorated. The &s;ucceed|ing week, Nytan and Ge&s;&s;eng, with their conjugal partners, went through a cour&s;e of vi&s;its in the city. Ge&s;&s;eng &s;urpri&s;ed his lord with a relation of the great things Ravenzar had been doing in his ab&s;ence. Through the va&s;t ridge of mountains, he had made eight more roads, with gradual a&s;cents, on each &s;ide the roads, to the mountains heights; on which he had built hou&s;es and furni&s;hed them with inhabi|tants. He had likewi&s;e, built a number of towns and cities, and &s;ettled a family in every hou&s;e. So that the whole number of citizens, men, women and children, that compo&s;ed the community, were an hundred thou&s;and. An amazing populating rapid|ity! but, what cannot fairies and genies perform? and there were many of them a&s;&s;i&s;ting in this glo|rious and benevolent work. 'I mu&s;t &s;oon further contribute my &s;hare towards increa&s;ing the number of our citizens, &s;aid the admiring &s;on of Renien, I have numbers in different parts of the world pre|pared for our i&s;land: and I intend it &s;hall not be long before they are here. You mu&s;t go my Ge&s;|&s;eng, and fetch more from China.' 'Many of the&s;e la&s;t, replied Ge&s;&s;eng, are from thence. Be&s;ides,
<PB N="112" REF="038495_0111_10122D48B4C64100">
they are all in&s;tructed in the Chine&s;e language, like tho&s;e &s;ettled here before them.' 'Very well, re|turned Nytan, you will however, I hope proceed with your fleet, once more, on this bu&s;ine&s;s, to Chi|na, and when you are there, I &s;hall &s;oon be with you. We will take our wives with us, and may kind and indulgent Heaven pro&s;per us, as it hath hitherto done.' Nytan was as good as his word; and Ge&s;&s;eng returned with his fleet, to China tak|ing with him his wife Olivia. His friend with Selina, &s;oon followed them, in his aerial vehicle. But before Nytan &s;at out he &s;ummoned two pow|erful genies. 'Ha&s;ten &s;aid he to them, to Per&s;ia, and fetch hither the men, women and children I have appointed. They will cheerfully obey your orders. And when they are here, furni&s;h them with hou&s;es and lands, and all things they &s;hall want.' The genies immediately proceeded on their errand. To conclude in a few words, Nytan and Selina, Ge&s;|&s;eng, and Olivia, were for &s;everal days, happy with their friends in China. After which the two for|mer, promi&s;ing another vi&s;it the next year, took leave of the Emperor and Empre&s;s, their &s;i&s;ters, brothers in law, and the court, and returned to Ra|venzar; where not long after, Ge&s;&s;eng and Olivia &s;afely arrived in the fleet, having three hundred fam|ilies. The genies likewi&s;e brought from Per&s;ia, &s;even thou&s;and new citizens, all of whom were &s;et|tled to their &s;ati&s;faction, and far beyond their ex|pectations.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e who were la&s;t introduced into the i&s;land, by Ravenzar, was a beautiful and highly accompli&s;hed lady Amelia. She was of high de&s;cent in a foreign country; but per&s;ecuted and driven thence, on account of her inflexible attach|ment to liberty, and to a few friends, of both &s;exes, who nobly dared to oppo&s;e the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures of an arbitrary an tyrannical government. Through their influence and exertions, great numbers became re&s;olutely engaged in freedom's cau&s;e. War was its inevitable con&s;equence. The zealous friends of the be&s;t of cau&s;es were indefatigable and per&s;evering till they had formed, and brought into the field, an army of twenty thou&s;and men, which unhappily was far exceeded by the oppo&s;ing tyrants; who&s;e innumerable cohorts poured in upon them, from all quarters, like a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s torrent. Victory was then permitted to decide in favour of the &s;courgers of mankind. Amelia and her friends being defeated, &s;he found means with a few adherents, to e&s;cape to a fore&s;t, under who&s;e gloomy &s;hades, they imagin|ed they might re&s;t awhile &s;ecure from pur&s;uers. But there they found but a temporary retreat. A party of the enemy, which had been &s;earching the
<PB N="114" REF="038495_0113_101224D69DA4E1E8">
fore&s;t, came upon them. They bravely oppo&s;ed force to force. But valorous and de&s;perate as they were, they were incapable of long re&s;i&s;ting ten times their number; and, had not unexpected aid appear|ed, they mu&s;t at lea&s;t, have yielded to death, or the chains of tyrants.&mdash;A man in flaming armour, dart|ed like lightning upon their conquering foes; and in&s;tantly they were &s;cattered, like pillars of &s;moke before the tempe&s;tuous wind! the terrific warrior no &s;ooner a&s;&s;aulted than he defeated and di&s;|per&s;ed, and, not a &s;ingle oppo&s;er, was from that moment either to be &s;een or heard. Whil&s;t Ame|lia and her little company were wondering at this &s;udden deliverance, the Victor approached, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed them in the following terms&mdash;'Valiant and worthy friends! Heaven be prai&s;ed, that &s;ent me to re&s;cue you from the power of a dete&s;table herd of tyrants and debauchees, who are the di&s;grace of hu|manity. Your brave re&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e murderers of the human &s;pecies, does you the greate&s;t honor. For&s;ake then, this land of &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion, and follow me to a country of freedom and bli&s;s. Thither will I conduct you in &s;afety; even where you will find that virtue, glory and felicity, which you have in vain though nobly exerted your&s;elves to promote and e&s;tabli&s;h here.' It was the great, the mighty genie Ravenzar who addre&s;&s;ed them; who was an&s;wered with the mo&s;t grateful acknowl|edgments, and ready acceptance of his proffered friend&s;hip and protection. He led them out of the fore&s;t, taking Amelia's hand, and committing two little girls &s;he had with her, to the care of his &s;er|vants, who were then ju&s;t come up to the com|pany. He conver&s;ed with them, as they walk|ed towards the road, on &s;uch &s;ubjects as tended to in&s;pire them with just sentiments of his character and di&s;intere&s;ted views, informing them who he
<PB N="115" REF="038495_0114_10122D4C66B57838">
was, and giving them a conci&s;e hi&s;tory of the place whither he intended to conduct them. 'How fatally &s;aid he, do tho&s;e tyrants, under the &s;pecious pretexts of liberty, and virtue, amu&s;e millions of people! You have &s;een, how little they could reli&s;h your ju&s;t remon&s;trances again&s;t their covetous di&s;po&s;itions, their vanity, intemperance, and hypocri&s;y. I will convey you my worthy friends, to a country, where truth and virtue are under&s;tood, and where liberty is more than an empty &s;ound to impo&s;e upon tho&s;e who are willing to be deceived.'</P>
<P>Amelia and her adherents readily followed the genie Ravenzar on board his fleet, and arrived in &s;afety to the happy i&s;land; where they &s;oon expe|rienced the unbounded genero&s;ity of their new friends; who placed them in &s;ituations of life mo&s;t agreeable to their inclinations, and the wi&s;e poli|cies and arrangements of the country, enriching them at the &s;ame time, far beyond their expectations, or even their de&s;ires. Amelia, with her two beauti|ful girls, cho&s;e a retired &s;ituation. Tho&s;e girls, the one eight, the other nine years of age, were the orphan daughters of her decea&s;ed brother, and had lived with her ever &s;ince the lo&s;s of her parents. As &s;he was exceeding fond of them, &s;he had &s;pared no pains in their education. She was therefore, furni&s;hed, agreeably to her wi&s;h as, with a large and well built hou&s;e delightfully &s;ituated about twenty miles from Xuntien, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the pub|lic road, and &s;urrounded by the noble&s;t growth of trees; having a fine large garden, in which it &s;tands upon an eminence that affords a fine pro&s;pect of the country, a branch of the river, hills, lawns, fields and groves, and the dwellings of the farmers on each &s;ide the water. In this romantic villa, Amelia &s;ettled, with her lovely nieces, and a few attendants, of both &s;exes. After a while, &s;he kept
<PB N="116" REF="038495_0115_10122D4F0C6C9290">
open doors, entertaining all &s;orts of company. For, in Ravenzar, there were none unworthy of her ho&s;|pitality, friend&s;hip, or e&s;teem. A large number, of both &s;exes, of learning and fine accompli&s;hments, con&s;tantly re&s;orted to her villa, often continuing there for &s;everal weeks. With the&s;e &s;he enjoyed all the &s;uperior plea&s;ures of a country life. Though the &s;ituation, was retired, it was by no means a &s;ol|itary one to her, who loved &s;ociety. Some times they walked in the exten&s;ive garden and groves; at others they vi&s;ited the indu&s;trious farmers, who were far from being ignorant, or unconver&s;ible, as is the case in &s;ome countries. Amelia likewi&s;e, had her hour of profitable employment, &s;tudy, embroidering and drawing. From her company and a&s;&s;ociates, great mutual advantages were derived, and which extended to the community; which is every greatly &s;erved by the rich, who are virtuous, in whatever &s;phere of life they move. Amelia not only read, and &s;tudied, but &s;he wrote elegantly and &s;ublimely, in pro&s;e and ver&s;e: and her conver&s;ation was always highly entertaining, as well as beneficial and in&s;truct|ing. If her per&s;on was beautiful, her mind was &s;till more &s;o: and though not exceeding twenty|three years of age, there were not many in the world, much older, that, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a greater &s;hare of knowledge, wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion. Among the gay young noblemen of her native country, &s;he had many admirers, who &s;ought her hand. But their manners and principles &s;he abhorred; and the pro&s;|pects of accumulated &s;plendor and magnificence, which they &s;et before her, &s;he deemed not worth a &s;ingle thought. But a few weeks before &s;he was driven from her native home, &s;he was addre&s;&s;ed by a merchant of fine accompli&s;hments, and gentle manners. His name was Philenor. For him &s;he entertained the tendere&s;t &s;entiments, and they had
<PB N="117" REF="038495_0116_10122D516E617578">
exchanged mutual vows of love and con&s;tancy. But he was now lo&s;t to Amelia! Philenor had &s;ailed to a far di&s;tant country; where he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have bid adieu to this life. To indulge in &s;i|lent, unnoticed grief for one, to whom &s;he once fondly hoped to be united, was that which gave the fir&s;t ri&s;e to her inclination for retirement. But, rea&s;on and virtue came to her aid; and, at length, convinced of the criminality of yielding to &s;ecret unavailing &s;orrow; with her former views, &s;he therefore, changed her plan; and courted &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Amelia however, frequently indulged her&s;elf in &s;olitary walks; enjoying the mo&s;t delicious plea&s;ure in the contemplation of the beauties of nature; ex|alting her thoughts from the wonders of creation, to the con&s;ideration of the power, glory and maje&s;|ty of the Creator. As &s;he rambled through, the fragrant groves; as &s;he walked over the carpets of living green, and amid&s;t the flowers and deli|cious &s;weets which exuberant nature had &s;pread around her;&mdash;&s;he &s;eemed to tread on enchanted ground, or as roving amid the luxuries of a &s;econd paradi&s;e!&mdash;In &s;ome cho&s;en &s;pot &s;ecure from ob&s;er|vation, &s;he would often take from her pocket, a lit|tle writing de&s;k; and reclining on the mo&s;&s;y bank, pour out, on paper, the effu&s;ions of a heart ever grateful to its divine former. The following peice may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of her talent in poetry. It was unde&s;ignedly dropped, in one of her morning walks: and to that accident we owe the plea&s;ure of tran&s;cribing it for the peru&s;al of tho&s;e who have a ta&s;te for poetical compo&s;ition. It is addre&s;&s;ed to the Creator, on the di&s;play of his glory and good|ne&s;s in the Creation and perfection of man.</P>

<P>Sublime thoughts like the&s;e, di&s;covered an eleva|tion of mind but &s;eldom equalled by the contem|poraries of Amelia, or in any age of the world. The works of creation, with which we are &s;urround|ed and in which we are involved, do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> afford a mo&s;t &s;atisfactory evidence of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in|tentions of the divine architect, with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to the pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s of man. A greater degree of felicity, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence, is only prevented by his weakne&s;s: and yet, out of this weakne&s;s ari&s;es his future immea&s;urable height of bli&s;s!</P>
<P>Not long after the return of Nytan, and his friends, from China, Selina propo&s;ed an excur&s;ion into the country, of which &s;he had heard &s;uch un|common panegyric's. Nothing could have been propo&s;ed more agreeable to him, as he was &s;en|&s;ible it would greatly conduce to the health as well as plea&s;ure of his fair &s;pou&s;e. Ge&s;&s;eng and Olivia were equally plea&s;ed with it, for the like rea&s;ons. They &s;at out on a fine morning, on hor&s;eback. As they rode through the city, they made an addition of two couple to the company; two &s;ervants only attending them. They rode &s;everal miles on the verdant flowery banks of the river. The tall and maje&s;tic oaks afforded them an agreeable &s;hade and defence from the &s;corching beams of the &s;un. Turning into one of the great roads that were cut out through the mountains, the pro&s;pects before them, and on each &s;ide, were luxuriantly magnifi|cent; which were &s;ucceeded by tho&s;e of alternate groves, fields and vales, buildings and planta|tions. After travelling near two hours, through tho&s;e dellghtful &s;cenes, they entered a gloomy wood.
<PB N="125" REF="038495_0124_10122D633B088C80">
Though the road was excellent: yet the dark &s;hade of the lofty trees, excluding the rays of the &s;un, gave the appearance of night; exciting a plea&s;ing horror and agreeable &s;olemnity for the &s;ucceeding hour; and they conver&s;ed but little. Having rode through the wood, they &s;aw before them a large well built hou&s;e, with an high wall of black marble, which they ob&s;erved to extend through groves of trees, and over hills, to a great di&s;tance. This was Amelia's Villa. On one &s;ide appeared to them part of a branch of the river, which in various windings, ran through the i&s;land; and a number of well con|&s;tructed hou&s;es on its banks. The &s;cenes, here, were delightfully romantic! 'Every thing invites us, &s;aid Olivia, to re&s;t here; and &s;ee who inhabits this retired man&s;ion.' 'You are very right lady re|plied Nytan. My curio&s;ity is excited, and, I doubt not, that of every one. Be&s;ides it is high time for us to re&s;t, and procure &s;ome refre&s;hment, where there is no doubt of our being welcome. The inhabi|tants of Ravenzar are the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable people in the world. I will ride on, if you plea&s;e, and make the fir&s;t appearance. He then quickened his hor&s;e's pace. But Selina's did not choo&s;e to be left behind, &s;o they both advanced together to the gate, which they found open. Alighting, and leaving their hor&s;es, they cro&s;&s;ed the court to a large hall, in which Amelia was reclining on a &s;offa; who &s;eeing two &s;trangers advancing, aro&s;e to meet them with an air of gaity and engaging familiarity.&mdash;'Sweet lady, &s;aid Nytan, give me leave to pre&s;ent you with a &s;i&s;ter, who mu&s;t certainly look upon you as her &s;econd &s;elf, you &s;o greatly re&s;emble her.' He was indeed &s;truck with the fine appearance of Amelia, and her likene&s;s to his Selina. They &s;aluted and embraced her, as was cu&s;tomary in this i&s;land of pure undi&s;&s;embled love. The Prince &s;aid a thou|&s;and

plea&s;ant things. None could be a more gal|lant and compa&s;&s;ionate admirer of the fair &s;ex. Struck, and enraptured, as he was, with the loveli|ne&s;s, and likeline&s;s of the two ladies, Which cried he, is Selina, and which is Amelia? Sure you are twin-&s;i&s;ters&mdash;what a &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;emblance of two of the mo&s;t perfect beauties nature ever formed!' The ladies were quite merry with his gallantry. 'I think however, added he, Silena may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a little palene&s;s. Then, con&s;cious of the occa&s;ion of this di&s;tinction, which could not but excite &s;ome anxious &s;en&s;ations, at the &s;ame time that it flattered his mo&s;t plea&s;ing hopes; he tenderly &s;eated them both on a &s;offa, calling upon his fellow travellers, who were entering the hall, to participate with him in the joy and plea&s;ure of &s;o unexpected and invaluable an acqui&s;ition to their &s;ociety. Amelia ro&s;e to receive them but in&s;tantly &s;unk lifele&s;s on the &s;offa! Every one was frightened, and ran to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Two lovely girls who were at work in a contiguous apartment, the door of which opened into the hall, flew to her with a &s;melling bottle. It &s;oon produced &s;igns of return|ing life! when Amelia opening her eyes, fixed them on the a&s;toni&s;hed and enraptured Philenor! it was indeed Philenor him&s;elf who&s;e &s;udden un|looked-for appearance had overcome the tender A|melia. 'O! exclaimed &s;he, Philenor, I had re|&s;igned you to Heaven; as lo&s;t to me for the pre&s;|ent life!'&mdash;'Heaven, replied he has rewarded your re&s;ignation by re&s;toring to you, your faithful lover, who will never more leave you! little indeed, did I ever expect this felicity! But my misfortunes are now amply recompen&s;ed. Yes. It was for this joyful event, that I was invited to the happy i&s;land of Ravenzar, and introduced to the illu&s;trious
<PB N="127" REF="038495_0126_10122D66749C27A8">
friends who have conducted me to the trea&s;ure of my heart!</P>
<P>Great was the joy of the company on &s;o fortunate an occurrence, which was brought forward in the manner following. Philenor was taken off a wreck by Ge&s;&s;eng, ju&s;t before his la&s;t arrival. The men would mo&s;t probably all have peri&s;hed, had not de|liverance been &s;o &s;ea&s;onably &s;ent them. A friend|&s;hip &s;oon commenced between two young men &s;o nearly re&s;embling each other, as did Ge&s;&s;eng and Philenor, both in age and &s;entiment. The latter had been in the country with the &s;eamen, &s;aved with him from the wreck, to view a &s;pot of land which has been recommended to them for their pre&s;ent re&s;idence, or future &s;ettlement, if they cho&s;e to con|tinue on the i&s;land; with regard to which they were to be wholly at their own aption. Ge&s;&s;eng had mentioned them, to Nytan with good commen|dations; highly prai&s;ing Philenor, as one who would do great honor to their &s;ociety. Adding, that he intended to introduce him, on his return from the country. It had been the intention of Philenor to return to his native home, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible by &s;uch means as &s;hould be concerted between him&s;elf Ge&s;&s;eng and Nytan. To return thither he pleaded indi&s;pen&s;able obligations. He, therefore, purpo&s;|ed to be at court, as &s;oon as he had determined mat|ters with his &s;eamen. Nytan, with his party of plea&s;ure had been gone from the palace, but an hour, when Philenor arrived there: and receiving directions had immediately followed them: over|taking them ju&s;t as Nytan had preceded his com|pany, and entered Amelia's gate. Thus it happen|ed that he &s;o unexpectedly appeared before her; who, having now recovered her pre&s;ence of mind, or|dered refre&s;hments to be brought into the hall. In the mean time, her new friends were congratulating
<PB N="128" REF="038495_0127_10122D689EA882C0">
her and her lover on &s;o happy a meeting, and &s;aving a thou&s;and plea&s;ant things. 'But I hope, &s;aid Ny|tan, we are not &s;oon to lo&s;e you. Philenor, I have learned, intended to return in a few days, to his country, doubtle&s;s, in que&s;t of his Amelia. But, now he has found her, I hope that intention will be laid a&s;ide; e&s;pecially when he is informed what has happened. He cannot, &s;carcely, imagine it can be for his Amelia's &s;afety, (if for his own) to return, at pre&s;ent, whatever he may do hereafter.' 'I think with you, my lord, replied Philenor on this &s;ubject. But I leave all to Amelia.' 'Then, &s;aid Selina, we may all keep up our &s;pirits! mine I confe&s;s were a little deranged, at the very idea of loo&s;ing Amelia. But, I dare to &s;ay, &s;he will not he in a hurry to vi&s;it a country &s;o abandoned as to per&s;ecute &s;uch excellence, and force her to flee from her native home. What &s;ay you, my charming friend!' O! dear lady, replied Amelia, I can add nothing to your arguments for my re|maining here, as in a happy a&s;ylum; after I have related to Philenor my misfortunes;&mdash;only that if I may take his word, we are never more to be &s;epa|rated.' 'No an&s;wered Philenor, mo&s;t certainly never. The idea of being &s;eparated, is intelerable for a moment! be&s;ides, if you, Amelia, chu&s;e to continue here for life, I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity make the &s;ame choice.

Our friend Nytan, can inform you, there are the be&s;t of lands at your &s;ervice.' 'And the &s;incere&s;t friends, &s;aid Nytan. Whatever a&s;&s;i&s;tance you may require, in re&s;pect of

Be&s;ides you will have apart|ments in my palace, and a &s;pacious elegant building of your own, nearly oppo&s;ite to it, in the city. We have, likewi&s;e trea&s;ures of money and jewels, which you are to command as your own. Let us then, my friends ha&s;ten to Xuntien, and &s;ee the&s;e amiable lovers united. Afterwards, we &s;hall find means to procure them intelligence from their na|tive country.' Philenor and Amelia, with the mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments, yielded them&s;elves to the advice and conduct of their generous friends; who propo&s;ed to conduct them immediately to Xun|tien.</P>
<P>Refre&s;hments were now brought in, and &s;et be|fore the company. Nytan and Selina, after they had all dined, propo&s;ed a walk in the garden, which being agreed to, they went thither. They found it to be laid out in ta&s;te. The two little girls were likewi&s;e with them, and admired for their beauty and behaviour. Olivia propo&s;ed to take them to Xuntien, declaring they &s;hould not be buried in the country. It is time for them, added &s;he, to &s;ee company. 'Have they been always, Amelia, con|tinued &s;he, thus &s;ecluded from the world?' 'Far from &s;o, replied Amelia: my hou&s;e is frequented by all &s;orts of people. We have &s;eldom two days without company, and the girls have always their &s;hare of it.' 'Well returned Olivia, we mu&s;t have them up to town, however.' 'By all means, ad|ded Nytan, we &s;hall on no account, con&s;ent to their being left; and I believe, Amelia, mu&s;t &s;hut up her hou&s;e, for two or three months at lea&s;t. We

&s;hall be very loth to part with her, and her beauti|ful neices, in le&s;s time.' Amelia expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t acknowledgments to her friends; adding that all &s;hould be as they thought proper. 'Well, then, replied Nytan, let us prepare to &s;et out, or it will be night before we reach Xuntien.' When they were returned to the hou&s;e, Amelia was not long in arranging her affairs. She com|mitted the care of her villa to her faithful &s;ervants, and her carriage was brought to the door; in which &s;he, with Philenor, and her two neices, entered, and all &s;et forward for Xuntien. The weather was fine, the company gay and cheerful. They made but one &s;hort &s;tage, about half way; and be|fore &s;un-&s;et, reached Nytan's palace; who led his company into a &s;pacious and magnificent apartment, the windows of which where open to the garden. Nothing could ever exceed the gaiety and &s;plendor of this apartment! It &s;eemed to be all alive with portraits large as were once the living originals; and paintings of romantic rural &s;cenes, all done in the utmo&s;t perfection of art. The&s;e were the ta|pe&s;try work of the orphan ladies. Neither would it be ea&s;y to find any fine pro&s;pects &s;uperior, if e|qual, to tho&s;e which the windows of this apartment afforded. Here tea was brought, and other refre&s;h|ments &s;uitable to the time and and occa&s;ion. Eve|ry one took what they plea&s;ed from a large marble table, which &s;tood under the window, loaded with every delicacy which nature provides to recruit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> travellers. After &s;itting an hour as the e|vening was delightful, and the moon &s;hone out with unu&s;ual lu&s;tre, they walked out into the garden. The air was perfumed with nature's &s;weets, and the brightne&s;s of the evening invited them to con|tinue walking till the hour of &s;upper. This was &s;erved up in the pavilion; the mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;itua|tion

It can &s;carcely be imagined&mdash;magnificent, delicious and inchanting as was every thing around them, that &s;o re&s;pectable and accom|pli&s;hed a company of friends could be wanting in con|ver&s;ation on &s;uch delightful and intere&s;ting &s;ubjects as the wonders of creation, the events of life, and their own knowledge and experience mu&s;t in&s;pire and dic|tate. When they met from the alleys and winding paths, in which each party had been &s;trolling, Philenor introduced &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the various man|ners of nations, and the heights of luxury and fal&s;e magnificence to which &s;ome had arrived; and on the fatal con&s;equences of vice and di&s;&s;ipation. He in&s;tanced &s;everal flouri&s;hing kingdoms, who&s;e de|&s;truction he ventured to prophecy, would ere long be the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of their extravagancies and vices. These subjects were renewned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and led to others equally intere&s;ting. 'One great cau&s;e &s;aid Nytan, of the mi&s;ery and ruin of nations, (little attended to) is intemperance in eat|ing and drinking. Men drown their rational facul|ties, by indulging their appetites. They load their bodies with bad humours, and &s;trengthen the fal&s;e appetites which they have acquired, weakening and de&s;troying their con&s;titutions. When the body is di&s;ordered by intemperance, the powers of the mind are, likewi&s;e weakened and depraved. Fal&s;e ideas of the enjoyment of life, are entertained, and produce innumerable expen&s;ive luxuries which render the rich bankrupt and oppre&s;&s;ive.

'All this have I &s;een realized, added Eudemon, [he being one of the company who joined the par|ty at Xuntien,] in the country from which I origin|ated. In former times, continued he, when the leading men of &s;ociety were virtuous and wife, &s;o|ber and temperate, my countrymen were influenced by their example; and enjoyed in a very remarka|ble degree the happine&s;s of civil and dome&s;tic life. But an unhappy negligence and over&s;ight in the all-important care and education of children, cau&s;ed intemperance gradually to take root, till it &s;pread, like an infectious di&s;ea&s;e, in every family; till, at length, temperance and &s;obriety, were words which had wholly lo&s;t their original &s;ignification, and mu&s;t now be con&s;idered as importing a decent kind of viciou&s;ne&s;s, very well comporting with virtue or re|ligion. In fine, every amiable grace and virtue be|came quite different things from what they formerly were; and men of intere&s;t and influence, who val|ued them&s;elves upon the excellency of their moral characters, were, accordingly, e&s;teemed as good men&mdash;the be&s;t of men; whil&s;t fa&s;hionable temper|ance was undermining their con&s;titutions, and load|ing them with di&s;ea&s;es; having already polluted their minds.&mdash;O unhappy country! how art thou e&s;tranged from thy ancient &s;implicity of manners, which arrayed thee with glory; from tho&s;e illu&s;|trious virtues, with which thou wa&s;t anciently a|dorned! how di&s;graceful is the di&s;tinction of men of character, wealth and influence now become, in di&s;cerning eyes, if there is any reality in virtue, if there be, in nature, any &s;uch things as true glory and real felicity!&mdash;di&s;graceful&mdash;becau&s;e &s;uch pa&s;s for great and good, benevolent and u&s;eful, generous and brave, who&s;e only real &s;olicitude is to gratify their avarice and ambition, their pa&s;&s;ion for luxuri|ous extravagant plea&s;ures, and fooli&s;h magnificence;

<P>'You indeed &s;peak melancholy truths, rejoined Ny|tan. What &s;cenes of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s have &s;uch men brought upon mankind in every age, as well as in the pre&s;ent; &s;ome of which I have my&s;elf been witne&s;s to, not long ago: and where the lower cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, who ought to be cheri&s;hed and cultivated to the utmo&s;t, are u&s;ed as beings crea|ted only for &s;lavery and impo&s;ition. They have religion: and what is it? The engine of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion: the religious leaders op|pre&s;&s;ing the people, at the &s;ame time that they gro&s;sly deceive them: in this they are leagued with tho&s;e who are called the great ones; but who may more ju&s;tly be denominated bea&s;ts of prey, devour|ing mon&s;ters, or, the plagues and tormentors of mankind. Such are the effects of unre&s;trained ap|petites and pa&s;&s;ions; rendering them never-cea&s;ing plagues to each other, de&s;troying virtue and &s;inceri|ty, truth and humanity from the world. Cu&s;tom has long rendered their vices and hypocri&s;y con&s;i&s;|tent with virtue, piety, &s;incerity and uprightne&s;s. And many, impo&s;ing upon them&s;elves, imagine that for their virtue and good deeds (re&s;pected as &s;uch) their names will be immortali&s;ed. But the immortality of their fame, will prove the immor|tality of their di&s;grace! The luxury, the profu&s;e magnificence of the rich and powerful are totally

repugnant to the principles and &s;entiments of a tru|ly virtuous mind. Though in a &s;ituation like ours, magnificence and &s;plendor are unavoidable. Since gold, diamonds, and pearls are our readie&s;t and cheape&s;t materials for building and ornament; and the trea&s;ures we po&s;&s;e&s;s, can &s;carcely ever be ex|hau&s;ted; by means of which likewi&s;e, we are ren|dered more capable of exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s. But perfect temperance pre&s;ides at our tables, and real virtue regulates our actions. The&s;e are all the gifts of our heavenly benefactor. It is through his &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure that we are temperate and virtuous, and gratitude in&s;pires and animates our exertions to render others as happy as our&s;elves.&mdash;But alas! What multitudes are there who mo&s;t mi&s;erably &s;uffer through the mi&s;taken ideas of liv|ing which they have imbibed and cheri&s;hed! and how many are there, who endure every hard&s;hip for a name or to accompli&s;h &s;ome imaginary valuable purpo&s;e; and that with a &s;urpri&s;ing fortitude and per&s;everance; who yet have not the courage to practice a ju&s;t temperance, and thereby procure to them&s;elves health, true plea&s;ure and tranquility, for a long &s;eries of years!&mdash;What ab&s;urdity and incon|&s;i&s;tency is here!&mdash;and which, tho&s;e who could &s;ub|due armies, and e&s;tabli&s;h empires, have not been a|ble, as to them&s;elves to obviate!

&s;aid to enjoy life. Our happine&s;s greatly de|pends upon the proper government and arrange|ment of our thoughts; which can never be &s;o a|ranged and governed without the &s;tricte&s;t temper|ance both in eating and drinking, and bodily exer|ci&s;e. For by the prevalency of bad humors, ari&s;|ing from intemperance, the mind becomes clouded and enervated; the rea&s;oning powers are deprived of their natural freedom and influence. Some in|dulge and pamper them&s;elves to that degree, that they can hardly think or crawl: others &s;tupify their &s;en&s;es, and drown their rational faculties with &s;trong drink. No man can enjoy the free exerci&s;e of the powers of his body or mind, who lives intem|perately. What a wide difference &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between &s;uch an one, and the man who is governed by the &s;tricte&s;t temperance! The former is erroneous in his judgement, wild in his projects, di&s;ordered in imagination, unhappy in his memory, depraved in his principles, a &s;lave to his pa&s;&s;ions, re&s;tle&s;s, &s;ick, di&s;ea&s;ed and ha&s;tening to a premature and mi&s;er|able death. The latter is wholly from tho&s;e evils; &s;uffers no inconveniences from his own conduct; his pa&s;&s;ions and appetites being &s;ub&s;ervient to his rea&s;on and his felicity. He enjoys a &s;ound mind in a healthy and vigorous body increa&s;es in wi&s;dom and experience; and armed with virtue and manly reflection, is always prepared for every event of life. He lives quietly through a long &s;eries of happy years, and grows ripe for a glorious immortality. Temperance and &s;obriety are indeed of the highe&s;t con&s;equence, both to the happine&s;s and the u&s;efulne&s;s of life. Experience evinces to every one who has made a fair trial of the &s;alutary effects of temper|ance, that, as is a man's temperance in his diet, &s;o is the &s;erenity, freedom and equality of his mind: and if there is a perpetual &s;amene&s;s in

At length fevers were brought upon them, and a varie|ty of &s;ymptoms and forerunners of incurable di&s;ea&s;|es, in the end &s;eized them. Whereas, tho&s;e who were guided by their rea&s;on (few as they were) were free from tho&s;e complaints, and enjoyed a great de|gree of health to old age. Their health would have been more perfect, and they would have lived ma|ny years longer had they been more perfect in the art of temperance. But mo&s;t of the people a|mong us, (for I am &s;peaking of my former coun|trymen) &s;eemed to act more like children, who hank&egrave;r and fret after every thing that is to be eat or drank: and with regard to children, the indul|gent parents very readily gratify them in their de|&s;ires, too often to their ruin.

with which temperance crowns her faithful vota|trires. I would addre&s;s them, continued Laertes, in &s;uch moving language as the following:&mdash;If tem|perance be the be&s;t pre&s;ervative of health, the friend of nature, and the offspring of virtue, the &s;ource of indu&s;try, and of every great and good action; if &s;he leads to true glory and renown, as &s;he fits the mind and body for every valuable purpo&s;e and em|ployment; if &s;he gives length of days, and perma|nent enjoyment; and if, on the other hand an in|temperate cour&s;e inevitably leads to irreparable mi&s;|ery; then let the&s;e weighty con&s;iderations rouze you from your unmanly indulgencies! break loo&s;e from the &s;hameful the di&s;graceful fetters with which vice would forever en&s;lave you, before they become too firmly rivited to be rent a&s;under.&mdash;Before it be too late, be intreated to &s;pare your&s;elves, ere the wanton wa&s;te of your natural &s;trength can never be repaired; before unavailing regret and angui&s;h be forced upon you, and cruel reflection awakes, like a giant refre&s;hed with wine; at once da&s;hing in pieces, every delu&s;ive hope, and inflicting tortures that can never be fully expre&s;&s;ed! For what can be conceived more dreadful than the condition of a per&s;on, who by his intemperance, has filled his bo|dy with loath&s;ome, incurable, tormenting di&s;ea&s;es! add to this the agonizing reflection, that by his own folly he hath rendered, the plea&s;ant and delight&s;ome &s;ummer of life, a dreary winter of premature old age, loaded with infirmities, di&s;orders, and racking pains! Thus would I endeavor to awaken my fel|low creatures to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their folly and mad|ne&s;s in de&s;troying them&s;elves by their intemperance, and may ten thou&s;and tongues and pens be employ|ed, in &s;o laudable an attempt, with all the mo&s;t per|&s;ua&s;ive and alluring charms and parapra&s;e of unrival|led

<P>It was thus this worthy company pa&s;t the even|ing, in conver&s;ing on &s;ubjects the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to mankind; who&s;e perfect felicity was among their fonde&s;t wi&s;hes, and to promote which they were never wanting in the mo&s;t vigorous exertions.

The time of repo&s;e being arrived, they retired, to their &s;everal apartments. In the morning after break|fa&s;ting, they re&s;umed their garden walks. Not that bu&s;ine&s;s was neglected.

Here &s;he con|tinued till the hour of breakfa&s;t; and indulging her poetic and pro&s;aic genius, compo&s;ed the following little pieces on temperance and the glories of crea|tion.</P>

<P>IT was on the fir&s;t day of the eighth year of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ravenzar, at noon they arriv|ed; after a long ab&s;ence in various parts of the world. Prince Nytan had tran&s;acted the affairs of his friend, effected an happy revolution in his native country, which held for &s;everal years, in which Rodrigo &s;wayed the &s;ceptre. A counter revolution dethroned him. He was the friend of Nytan, the pupil of Ravenzar. By their aid, he with a few adherents to virtue, was &s;oon rendered &s;ecure and happy in this favoured i&s;le. The Prince with his illu&s;trious friends, had vi&s;ited the court of Renien, after having compleated his other affairs abroad.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It was about this time, (as related by a Chine&s;e wri|ter, <HI>Lein&s;han</HI>) the Emperor Renien paid a vi&s;it to his &s;on, and was received by his friends and fellow citizens with the greate&s;t re&s;pect.</P><P>Another writer relates, that the ve&s;&s;el which conveyed the Emperor, was by a &s;torm, drove on the rocks and &s;plit to pieces. That the fairy Leingreing de&s;cended to his re&s;cue, in a magnificent vehicle drawn by dragons. She was accompanied by two females of exqui&s;ite beau|ty. The &s;pacious vehicle received the whole company of the Emperor, his two daughters and attendants. Kin|dred minds, when they meet, &s;oon become united in the bands of endearing friend&s;hip. They were all &s;afely con|veyed, by the fairy to Prince Nytans palace, where they remained &s;everal days when the Fairy announced her purpo&s;e of departing with her lovely companions. Ereng and Yerrie, the Emperors daughters, were &s;eized with the mo&s;t poignant grief at the thoughts of a &s;eparation from their newly-acquired friends. They were twin &s;i&s;ters; and the Fairy had lately taken them into her protection, having relieved them from the deepe&s;t poverty and afflic|tion. This &s;tory is affecting and intere&s;ting. The Fai|ry Leingreing was conveying them to a rece&s;s &s;he had pro|vided for them; where they were to compleat their ed|ucation, and after a &s;eries of happy events they were to become inhabitants of Ravenzar. The Fairy perceiving the grief occa&s;ioned by this &s;eparation, a&s;&s;ured them of an happy meeting in a few months in the Emperors palace. The Emperor after enjoying &s;everal weeks the plea&s;ures of Ravenzar returned to his own dominions, full of its won|der's; and it was a plea&s;ure to a mind like his to ac|knowledge the &s;uperiority of Ravenzar.</P></NOTE>

This was the day of their return to their beloved fellow-citizens. The &s;hore was crowded to re|ceive them, and congratulate their arrival. The &s;un beamed forth with unu&s;ual &s;plendors, and na|ture added new graces to her enchanting &s;miles!</P>
<P>A grand fea&s;t was &s;erved up in the hall and the courts and lawns around it; and the whole city en|tertained, without the lea&s;t confu&s;ion among &s;o va&s;t a multitude. There were concerts of mu&s;ic at proper intervals, and the illu&s;trious a&s;&s;embly broke not up till long after the u&s;ual hour of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Philenor and Amelia had been per&s;uaded to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> all thoughts of returning to their country villa;

and the neices of Amelia were become &s;o attached to the families of Prince Nytan and Ge&s;&s;eng, that nothing could afford them more plea&s;ure than the re&s;ignation of the villa. They were now accom|modated with buildings and gardens adjoining the Prince's. For which purpo&s;e the mountains were levelled to a great extent. One high wall enclo&s;ed all the gardens and buildings of the three friends. Nothing ever equalled their beauty and magnifi|cence. The re&s;igned villa was made a pre&s;ent to Randor, one of the &s;ailors &s;hip-wrecked with Phi|lenor. He manufactured the fine&s;t of linen. Thus was this &s;ailor rai&s;ed from the lowe&s;t &s;tate of wretch|edne&s;s, by means of Ravenzar and the three friends; and placed in the happie&s;t &s;ituation in the fine&s;t country in the world. The unfortunate and op|pre&s;&s;ed are jyoifully received by the citizens of Ra|venzar, formed by Heaven to benevolence. The Deity ever looks with melting pity on the uni&s;era|ble and de&s;titute. Not one e&s;capes his all-&s;eeing eye; and for every one he appears, at the proper hour and moment of relief. The Prince frequent|ly &s;pent a &s;olitary hour in his chamber in the grove, the chamber which reminded him of pa&s;t affecting &s;cenes. There he often thought of his rural retreat in China, and the happine&s;s it afforded his friends. He was &s;till fond of that plea&s;ant rece&s;s of his own forming. There he likewi&s;e wrote to his &s;i&s;ters. The following extract from one of his letters is at once expre&s;&s;ive of his fondne&s;s for that retirement, and the affectionate and exalted &s;entiments of his heart. And his memoirs of Elvina are far from unentertaining. The &s;i&s;ters, when they received the epi&s;tle, were &s;itting together in one of its mo&s;t delightful chambers over their tea. It gave indeed an heightened reli&s;h to their evenings repa&s;t. The Prince, after relating &s;ome intere&s;ting dome&s;tic af|fairs,

thus continues, 'And why are we &s;evered from each other at &s;o great a di&s;tance? Is it not to ren|der our plea&s;ure more extatic, when we meet? Add to this, the other plea&s;ures of ab&s;ent friends in each other, and the plea&s;ing, the tran&s;porting expecta|tion of futute meeting.&mdash;O! my dear &s;i&s;ters, how far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes is our felici|ty here?

But &s;oon, very &s;oon will you conver&s;e with a few of us, in your happy rece&s;s. Ah! &s;acred, volup|tuous retirement! Thee &s;hall we often revi&s;it; thy romantic apartments&mdash;thy delicious walks. There &s;hall we talk of the refined happine&s;s of our highly privileged &s;ociety; and deplore with you, the vices and errors of that world from which we are detach|ed. How far, how exceeding far, are mankind di&s;tanced from ju&s;t ideas of living&mdash;from the true enjoyment of exi&s;tence. The&s;e ari&s;e only from a ju&s;t knowledge of the Deity, con&s;tant dependance upon and unre&s;erved confidence in him. Hence we rea&s;on ju&s;tly, think and act wi&s;ely; and our day is al|ways clear and &s;erene. Whereas, in the world, (tho&s;e excepted to whom we have a commi&s;&s;ioned acce&s;s) men really live together more like infernals than rationals.

<P>Elvina &s;till retains, in a great mea&s;ure, her pe|culiarities and gloomine&s;s of mind, notwith&s;tanding her change of condition.

Which they mu&s;t do, if he made but to de&s;troy; gave exi&s;tence but to annihilate. For a continuation of that being is of all things the mo&s;t de&s;irable. And do we know we mu&s;t forever cea&s;e to exi&s;t, that our life may be the more mi&s;erable? This makes the Creator a malevolent being, who merits the cur&s;e of his creatures. Then every thing great, good, and glorious, are &s;ources of mi&s;ery, and vain is virtue. Neither have we need of grateful hearts. What have we for which to be thankful, if born only to &s;ee good, and then forever to be deprived of it. If it be &s;o, God and his creation are utterly contemptible. No wonder men depraved and vicious, proud and in&s;olent harbor &s;uch ideas; they are the offspring of vice and ill-nature.

Thus writes Prince Nytan, to his beloved and a|miable &s;i&s;ters, from his little retired chamber; once the pri&s;on of his confinement, when decoyed from their agreeable &s;ociety in the rece&s;s; in which they &s;till, with their invaluable friends, &s;pent ma|ny a delightful hour.</P>
<P>One day when he was enjoying a &s;olitary hour in his little chamber in the garden, who &s;hould enter its door but Sanden and Roderigo, arm in arm.&mdash;He was both &s;urprized and tran&s;ported. Springing from his &s;eat&mdash;How agreeably &s;udden and unlooked for is this! cried he. Welcome dear|e&s;t friends! I am overjoyed to &s;ee you! 'Ah my Prince! returned Sanden, this &s;ituation, this apart|ment! well am I reminded of a cruel traitor and enemy, and of his attrocious crimes! What cele&s;tial goodne&s;s would he have bla&s;ted!' A &s;hower of tears &s;ucceeded tho&s;e words. The in&s;ide of the cham|ber he knew, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome alterations, to be the &s;ame in which his Prince had been formerly con|fined, and de&s;tined to death. The Prince was great|ly affected for a moment. But recollecting him|&s;elf&mdash;'My deare&s;t Sanden, cried he, how happy have my little misfortunes rendered me, by procuring me your invaluable friend&s;hip! Such, my Roderigo, is Sanden, both to you and me, that nothing can ever di&s;turb our mutual felicity.' 'Well replied San|den, our worthy and amiable friend &s;hall, at con|venient time, be made acquainted with all. You mu&s;t ha&s;ten with us to the palace, to &s;ee the illu&s;|trious company we have brought you, and learn how it has happened, that we, whom you believed to be thou&s;ands of miles di&s;tant from each other, now meet in Ravenzar.</P>
<P>Ge&s;&s;eng was arrived with his fleet from China, and Ravenzar and Roderigo from the country of the latter, with great numbers of worhty families.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="038495_0155_10123F5671BDBFD8">
Inexpre&s;&s;ibly joyful was the meeting of the&s;e friends and the newly acquired citizens. They were fea&s;ted &s;everal days by the inhabitants of Xuntien. Ravenzar left them on the third day from their arrival: and, as the fleet was &s;oon to return to China, Roderigo cho&s;e to accompany Sanden, and vi&s;it that renowned empire; from whence, after a few weeks, he returned to his beloved friends; and was accommodated with Philenor's man&s;ion in Xuntien, till further arrangements were made in his favor by the vigilence of the Prince and the citizens.</P>
<P>The principle men of Xuntien and the other cit|ies, now often a&s;&s;embled with Prince Nytan to con|&s;ult on the intere&s;ts of their country, and plan &s;chemes of utility the mo&s;t wi&s;e, the mo&s;t benevolent and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive. Here (writes an hi&s;torian of Xuntien) was a government of a mo&s;t &s;uperior kind; great|ly re&s;embling that of an higher order of beings, who&s;e exi&s;tence is beyond the ken of human &s;ight, except when &s;uch of them as are commi&s;&s;ioned from Heaven render them&s;elves vi&s;ible, and hold conver&s;e with the wi&s;e and virtuous of mankind.&mdash;Here (in this new-formed community) was di&s;played the mo&s;t con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, and the mo&s;t excellent exam|ples of virtue, piety, and di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence. Here was become univer&s;ally habitual, a tranquil|ity and happine&s;s for incalculable years. Here the citizens, of both &s;exes, increa&s;e beauty, and vig|or, and every amiable accompli&s;hment, as they ad|vance in life. Many, &s;everal hundred years old have &s;till all the bloom and energy of youth, the mo&s;t perfect exerci&s;e of the mental powers; and wait, in cheerful expectation of the approaching period when, with immortality, all nations &s;hall be forever united in the mo&s;t pure and the mo&s;t &s;ublime enjoy|ment

of exi&s;tence. Happy community &s;o highly privileged! with whom exalted intelligences &s;upe|rior to humanity often a&s;&s;ociate! here, too, the ten+ants of the fore&s;ts have have put off their &s;avage na|ture, and rejoice with man! here no noxious ani|mal lives, nor a creature perpetrates mi&s;chief, or excites a fear! Such is the reward of virtue like that of the citizens of this favored i&s;le!</P>
<P>Roderigo now employed mo&s;t of his time in &s;tu|dying the affairs and manners of the country; was exceedingly happy in the friend&s;hip of his fellow-citizens, and &s;oon became mo&s;t eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for his abilities and his exertions for the public good. A peculiar circum&s;tance had attend|ed him, even from his earlie&s;t years, and very unac|countable, con&s;idering his many amiable qualities:&mdash;He affected not female &s;ociety, though few were more capable of rendering them&s;elves agreeable to the mo&s;t engaging of the fair. His mind was ex|alted, his heart tender and benevolent, and his ex|terior perfectly formed. This peculiarity is to be accounted for only from the &s;ecret influence of Ra|venzar on his mind, lea&s;t an attachment &s;hould in|terfere with a &s;eries of events that were to be pro|ductive of his future felicity in the connubial &s;tate. Neither is it unfrequent, in this world of my&s;teries and eccentricities, that things, unaccountable to hu|man wi&s;dom and di&s;cernment, are in the chain of events wi&s;ely ordered, and in their proper place. However, the perfection of the female character, now pre&s;ented to him, began to in&s;pire other &s;en|timents in his heart, than &s;uch as he perhaps with too mu&s;t rea&s;on had indulged in his native country.</P>

<P>THE mild and calm region of peace and health; where unaffected mode&s;ty and &s;weet affabili|ty rendered beauty and wit enchanting, and minds cultivated with real &s;cience; was the bli&s;sful lot of Nytan, and the friends with whom he was &s;urround|ed&mdash;in a country de&s;tined to be the riche&s;t &s;ample, to the world, of nature in all her loveline&s;s, per|fection and felicity. But his generous heart, ex|panding with benevolence towards the human race, admitted not of his confinement, even to friends and citizens &s;o worthy and amiable, or to an i&s;land &s;o de|licious, &s;o exten&s;ive, and populated by thou&s;ands of inhabitants, every individual of which were ever ca|pable of affording him the mo&s;t agreeable entertain|ment, the &s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure. They were citizens who delighted only in real virtue, and who&s;e manners were pure and refined; and therefore could not fail of being always plea&s;ing and engaging to a mind formed like his. But he loved to range a|broad in que&s;t of adventures indeed of the mo&s;t excellent and &s;uperior kind; not in the pur&s;uit of vain, fooli&s;h ambition, wanton plea&s;ure; but

after objects of benevolence &s;uch objects as mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ively called for tho&s;e friendly aids, tho&s;e gen|erous attentions, which Nytan was formed, by the &s;ource of goodne&s;s, to in a world admini&s;ter, in olved in the di&s;graces and mi&s;eries in&s;eparable from folly and vice; in nations who&s;e great are &s;o meanly lit|tle, and who&s;e in&s;tructors and guides are &s;o ba&s;ely degenerate, &s;o uninformed in real wi&s;dom and vir|tue.&mdash;In the pur&s;uit of &s;uch adventures, through which only true glory is acquired, he was unwea|ried, bold and enterpri&s;ing; di&s;couraged by no la|bours or difficulties, deterred by no dangers.</P>
<P>It was on one of his benevolent excur&s;ions to Bagdad, he was accompanied by Philenor, Silena, Amelia and her lovely neices. Aledden, the grand vizier's &s;on, had no power to re&s;i&s;t the charms of Maria. He fir&s;t beheld her at the country &s;eat his father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a few miles from the city; at which he, with his gue&s;ts, were only refre&s;hing them&s;elves, in order to proceed to his mo&s;t favoured &s;eat twelve miles further, where were the mo&s;t magnificent gar|dens. It was there the grand vizier, having lately become a widower, chiefly re&s;ided. Aleddin's bu|&s;ine&s;s prevented his attending the company to that &s;eat, and the next day he was to go on urgent affairs to a far di&s;tant town. He had therefore but a mo|ments conver&s;ation with Maria, in which he ex|pre&s;&s;ed to her how painful was the obligation he was under to &s;eparate him&s;elf from her and her worthy and amiable friends. When they were gone forward on their route, he gave way to chagrin and grief at being &s;o unfortunately circum&s;tanced: when, on looking over the papers he was to take with him on his journey, he found to his joy, an e&s;|&s;ential document mi&s;&s;ing. This made it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould &s;et out in the evening to wait on his father for the paper he had neglected to leave.
<PB N="160" REF="038495_0159_10123F60C69F4448">
When he arrived within view of the hou&s;e, he was in raptures to &s;ee Maria on the road, far di&s;tanced from the re&s;t of the company, who were walking. He ha&s;tened to her, and, di&s;mounting from his hor&s;e, begged leave to attend her; informing her of the circum&s;tance that rendered him &s;o happy as to be|hold her once more before he &s;at out on his journey. In expre&s;&s;ing to her his affection he was heard by Maria with greate&s;t apparant indifference; and at length &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon his entirely dropping the &s;ubject. When they were arrived to the hou&s;e, he waited on his father in his clo&s;et, who &s;urpri&s;ed at his own negligence, gave him the paper, in&s;i&s;ting on his returning after &s;upper, and ha&s;tening his jour|ney. He knew the nece&s;&s;ity of this too well to ob|ject. He was happy however in the pre&s;ence of the fair object of his affection at &s;upper, and with the company and conver&s;ation of her illu&s;trious friends. Ritiring to a chamber, he penned an e|pi&s;tle to Maria, which having fini&s;hed, and left with a &s;ervant on whom he could depend to deliver to her, if po&s;&s;ible, that evening, he returned to the company, bade them adieu, and departed to prepare for his journey on the morrow.</P>
<P>When Maria peru&s;ed the epi&s;tle, it pre&s;ented to her a mind formed to her fonde&s;t wi&s;hes. At the bottom of it &s;he read the following lines&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>A mind &s;o &s;weetly form'd to love</L>

But Aleddin his heart reveals,</L>
<L>And not a &s;ingle thought conceals.</L></Q>
<P>As Aleddin had intreated for an an&s;wer to his e|pi&s;tle; Maria after &s;everal hours mu&s;ing on the &s;ubject of it, in a delightful grove whither &s;he often retired, at length took her pen, and complied with his reque&s;t. Their corre&s;pondence continued till his return when they became con&s;tant vi&s;itants to the grove, and admired together the plea&s;ant &s;cenes around it,</P>
<P>After a few days Philenor attended the grand vizier to his hou&s;e in town to a&s;&s;i&s;t him &s;ome bu|&s;ine&s;s. Amelia and Silena vi&s;ited the Sultana. Prince Nytan having &s;pent an hour in writing, walked out alone.</P>
<P>At a &s;mall di&s;tance from the hou&s;e, was a large wood. A plea&s;ant opening in it invited him to en|ter. One agreeable view &s;ucceeding another, drew him forward, till he found him&s;elf on the further &s;ide of the wood; and a va&s;t plain before him, which &s;eemed bounded only by the horizon. Find|ing him&s;elf &s;till inclined to walk, and excited by &s;ome degree of curio&s;ity to know what terminated &s;o exten&s;ive a plain, he pur&s;ued his cour&s;e over it till he &s;aw before him, a large building, environed by an high wall, be perceived one of the leaves of the gate open, which an increa&s;ed curio&s;ity deter|mined him to enter. When he had entered the gate, he walked through a grand porch of marble, furni&s;hed with &s;offas and a carpet of cloth of gold. He made a &s;tand in the court, and looked on all &s;ides to &s;ee if any one ob&s;erved him. But no crea|ture appeared, at which he was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed. He walked on to the hall, the gate of which was o|pen, having a curtain of &s;ilk and gold partly drawn before it. Here he made another &s;tand, and knock|ed
<PB N="162" REF="038495_0161_10123F64D144CAA8">
with his &s;taff, at the gate. No one yet appear|ing, he repeated knocking, but could make nobody hear. He then put a&s;ide the curtain, and entered the hall, calling aloud as he advanced into it; but to no purpo&s;e. He neither &s;aw nor heard any per&s;on or creature. The hall he ob&s;erved to be furni&s;hed with the mo&s;t profu&s;e magnificence. The windows being open, pre&s;ented to his view an exten&s;ive and delightful garden, and the birds charmed him with &s;weet melody; the only exi&s;ting beings he had per|ceived. He &s;at to one of the windows, &s;ome time, to re&s;t and entertain him&s;elf with the beautiful pro&s;|pects of beds of flowers, &s;pacious gravel walks lined with fruit trees, and di&s;tant groves, and rai&s;ed grounds which extended a great di&s;tance before him. At length he imagined he heard human cries in a di&s;tant part of the garden; and a door, which led into it, being open on the right hand, he ha&s;ten|ed through it, and walked down the garden, on the &s;ide from whence the &s;ounds he heard &s;eemed to ari&s;e. As he advanced nearer he was convinced they were the cries of a per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s. He quickened his pace, and entered, through a &s;mall gate, into a thick grove. In few minutes, he beheld too plainly, what had a|larmed him. In the centre of the grove, was a large vacancy, where three Africans were beating a man who was almo&s;t naked.</P>
<P>The building and the grounds about it, were the property of a rich Turk; who having lo&s;t a lovely and amiable wife, the month after his marriage, had retired thither from &s;ociety. He was attended only by a few African &s;laves, who taking advantage of his deep retirement, and incen&s;ed again&s;t him on account of former rigorous treatment, aimed at his death, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his trea&s;ures. Prince Nytan having freed the &s;ufferer, and &s;ecured the blacks was entertained by the Turk, Siedden, with
<PB N="163" REF="038495_0162_10123F67680047B8">
the mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments. One of the &s;laves, (di&s;&s;enting from the wicked purpo&s;es of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins,) they had confined; not daring to touch his life, becau&s;e he was of a great family in their own country; to which they intended returning; having &s;ecretly provided every thing for that pur|po&s;e. To this hone&s;t and worthy &s;lave, Sieddin gave his freedom, and a &s;um of money, by which he was enabled to return to Africa, if he thought proper. Nytan likewi&s;e per&s;uaded him to free the others, to pardon and di&s;mi&s;s them; offering a &s;up|ply of money from his own pur&s;e to defray their expences in returning home. He conver&s;ed with them in their own language. He enlightened their minds and in&s;pired them, at length with unfeigned contrition. Few &s;ons of Kings thought and acted like this Prince and heir to the Chine&s;e empire. Sieddin admired his virtues, li&s;tened with eagerne&s;s and delight to his in&s;tructive conver&s;ation, and ac|ceded with plea&s;ure, by him before unfelt, to his benevolent de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Thus was our amiable philanthropi&s;t acting in concert with Heaven in deducing good from evil. The di&s;&s;enting &s;lave, who&s;e name was Zaddguin, was tran&s;ported with joy at this unexpected turn of affairs, this divine interpo&s;ition to re&s;cue the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed and reclaim the vicious and abandoned. Prince Nytan learned of Zaddquin, that Africa &s;carcely ever produced a more amiable and virtu|ous monarch than was Mingeng, the &s;overeign of the realm of which he was a &s;ubject. 'He was an enemy to every &s;pecies of &s;lavery (&s;aid Zaddquin.) He &s;uffers none of his &s;ubjects to be concerned in that inhuman traffic. The Almighty, &s;aid he, will avenge it by a dreadful puni&s;hment.' 'Yes, an|&s;wered Nytan, the emancipation of the human race from every &s;pecies of &s;lavery is not far di&s;tant. The
<PB N="164" REF="038495_0163_10123F6A1C831280">
mi&s;ts of ignorance are fa&s;t di&s;per&s;ing. You, Zadd|quin, &s;hall carry a letter from me to your &s;overeign. He is the friend of humanity, and will become an in&s;trument of much good in the African world.'</P>
<P>Thus by the benign interpo&s;ition of Heaven and the friend of mankind, Zaddquin again beheld his native country, and his family. He pre&s;ented the Prince's letter to his &s;overeign. Mingeng profited by its in&s;tructions, and many of his &s;ubjects, after a corre&s;pondence was opened between him and king Zanger, whom the Prince recommended to his friend&s;hip, be&s;ides furni&s;hing him with &s;uitable books in his own language. U&s;eful knowledge be|gan to make a rapid progre&s;s through tho&s;e two Af|rican realms.</P>
<P>Sieddin became a convert to the principles of freedom and truth; between whom, and Prince Nytan, a corre&s;pondence was &s;ettled; when the lat|ter, taking leave of his newly acquired friends, &s;at out on his walk back to the grand vizier's. On his way through the wood, he beheld a youth engaged with two others, and fighting valiantly for his life. They were robbers who attacked him. The Prince advanced unob&s;erved, and, aiming a &s;tone at the head of one of the robbers, brought him to the ground: and a &s;econd &s;tone levelled the other robber at his &s;ide. The young man found him&s;elf at liberty, without &s;eeing the hand that did the execution on his adver&s;aries. Nytan &s;oon di&s;covered him&s;elf; and advancing to the youth congratulated him on his &s;afety, offering him&s;elf for company through the re&s;t of the wood.</P>
<P>'I am an inhabitant of this wood, replied the young man. The man&s;ion of my friends is not far from hence: and, as I am obliged to you for my life, let me prevail with you, my noble and gener|ous friend, to walk home with me, and take &s;ome

<P>This youth was of an hand&s;ome and engaging form; and there was &s;omething in his countenance that gave an additional charm to his addre&s;s, which agreeably compelled the Prince to accept of his in|vitation. They walked together in a path that led through the thicke&s;t of the wood. At length a grad|ual opening di&s;covered the young &s;tranger's &s;eque&s;|tered abode, which they &s;oon reached. The man|&s;ion was elegant, and &s;urrounded with a variety of fruit trees. They entered a hand&s;ome apartment, in which &s;at a man and a woman, who appeared in the vigor and bloom of youth. 'O reward the man who hath &s;aved me from robbers,'&mdash;Exclaimed the youth. 'Welcome Prince Nytan, cried they, ri&s;|ing. Your appearance exactly agrees with the grand vizier's de&s;cription of the fir&s;t of men.' And they cordially embraced. 'Such as I am &s;aid the Prince, I profe&s;s my&s;elf your friend and &s;ervant, and a &s;incere lover of you and yours.' 'What we &s;peak, &s;aid the beautiful woman, is warm from our hearts. The character given you by the grand vi|zier, was &s;ufficient to in&s;pire our love, re&s;pect and e&s;teem, amiable Prince, without the additional ob|ligation to affection and gratitude, on account of the &s;ervice you have rendered this youth, the riche&s;t trea&s;ure of which we boa&s;t. Pray Prince be &s;eat|ed; and henceforward call this hou&s;e, and its in|habitants, your own, and likewi&s;e all they po&s;&s;e&s;s. Now we have &s;een Prince Nytan under our roof, we can &s;ay we have lived to &s;ome valuable purpo&s;e.' The Prince, blu&s;hing, &s;at down, &s;aying he was bound to exert him&s;elf to become worthy of their affections. And I find continued he, I have more worthy and ine&s;timable friends than the grand vizier

had advi&s;ed me of. But, pray let me be no longer ignorant by what names to call them.'</P>
<P>'Call me Debournon, &s;aid the elder, and the young man, whom you have made forever obliged to you, Parcellus. My fair partner's name is Sa|bina. Is &s;he not fair and hand&s;ome, Prince, for a woman who has &s;een her two hundred and fiftieth year? and I am only a year older. There hath been no very perceivable alteration in our health's or per&s;ons, for above two hundred and thirty years. We are both the adopted children of your illu&s;trious friend Ravenzar.' How you a&s;toni&s;h me! replied Nytan. This day hath been to me a day of won|ders: and you, &s;ire, will be of my opinion, when I have related to you its events! But why are not you, with your little family (if I &s;ee all of it before me) inhabitants of the i&s;land of Ravenzar? For I am per&s;uaded you have been long (ere now) quali|fied for that happy country.' 'I will inform you, returned he, pre&s;ently. But fir&s;t let my Sabina &s;et before us refre&s;hment. And while we are eating and drinking together, I will relate to you our little hi&s;tory. Sabina then laid the cloth in another room, and placed the table before them, near a door, which being open, commanded a view of the gar|den, fields, and groves; the woods being on either &s;ide of the delightful pro&s;pect; which the declin|ing &s;un rendered the more beautiful and charming; whil&s;t the variety of birds entertained them with their &s;prightly &s;ongs.</P>
<P>Debournon re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e.&mdash;'My dear Prince, &s;aid he, illu&s;trious as you are, and of noble&s;t de&s;cent; yet your mind, far more noble, di&s;dains not the man of meane&s;t birth, who&s;e virtues render him a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, and prepare him for the enjoyment of &s;ublimer plea&s;ures and honors than this tran&s;itory &s;cene affords? Permit me to &s;ay, my
<PB N="167" REF="038495_0166_10123F70D79EFB58">
beloved and revered &s;ire, (interrupted Nytan) that I value not my&s;elf for being born a Prince, but on|ly for that degree of virtue and u&s;eful knowledge, which, by the bounty of Heaven I po&s;&s;e&s;s. I have renounced kingdoms; di&s;dained the titles of royal|ty and nobility, (they are beneath my ambition) and glory in being only a citizen of Ravenzar, formed by men, who had no honors of which to boa&s;t, but &s;uch as aro&s;e from their probity and benevolence. Tho&s;e only convey real honor to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Pardon, &s;ire my interruption, and let me intreat you to proceed in your relation.' 'My parents re&s;um|ed Debournon, were the meane&s;t of mechanics in Bagdad; yet, free from di&s;grace&mdash;they were hone&s;t and indu&s;trious. I lo&s;t them very early, and was left a poor friendle&s;s de&s;titute orphan. At a me|lancholy date, from my exi&s;tence, the benevolent genie Ravenzar was plea&s;ed to take notice of me; and, after a few nece&s;&s;ary gifts and good coun&s;els, he one day told me that if I inclined to agriculture, he would buy me a piece of ground, &s;tock it, and provide me with a &s;ervant to a&s;&s;ist my labour. I expre&s;&s;ed my gratitude, and the plea&s;ure I &s;hould take in a country life, provided I might have time to pro&s;ecute my &s;tudies. For I was exceeding fond of books, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an eager de&s;ire of learning every thing that was attainable from the few left me by my father. The Genie highly applauded my pa&s;&s;ion for &s;cience, and promi&s;ed me his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and a number of books. Labour, added he, if ex|erci&s;ed with a ju&s;t temperance, will be of great ad|vantage to your health; and render you better &s;it|ted for &s;tudy. In a word, before another month c|lap&s;ed from the decea&s;e of my father, who &s;urvived my mother but a year, that generous friend of the poor, &s;ettled me on a part of the&s;e lands which I now po&s;&s;e&s;s, and afterwards added to my farm a tract
<PB N="168" REF="038495_0167_10123F7404D80168F">
of land containing two thou&s;and acres. In a few years, by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I built this hou&s;e, and let out the &s;maller one I had occupied, to a tenant of his chu&s;ing, who had &s;ons old enough and capable of cultivating a thou&s;and acres to great advantage. My income increa&s;ed, I &s;oon grew rich, and capa|ble of affording a&s;&s;i&s;tance to others, after the noble example of my benefactor. Without my inform|ing him he knew of the charities I had be&s;towed, and applauded my genero&s;ity and the prudence and di&s;cretion with which I exerci&s;ed it. When I was arrived to the age of five and twenty, he entered my apartment with a young dam&s;el fair as the morn. 'I have brought you a worthy female partner, &s;aid he, &s;ay do you like her for a wife?' 'Who, an|&s;wered I, can be otherwi&s;e than charmed and cap|tivated with &s;o much beauty and loveline&s;s. If I might be &s;o happy as to gain the affections'&mdash;'You have gained them already, interrupted Ravenzar, &s;he is yours. I brought her up for you. Stand forth then and be married.' And married we were, before we knew, &s;carely, what we were about. The Genie having married, embraced, and pro|nounced his ble&s;&s;ing upon us, left us to our&s;elves; &s;aying as he went away, 'I will call upon you in the morning, and &s;pend &s;ome time with you. Let your wife ri&s;e early, and prepare us a good break|fa&s;t.' As he refu&s;ed to &s;tay to &s;upper, (it being that hour) we eat and drank by our&s;elves, and went to bed.</P>
<P>'Before &s;un-ri&s;e, the Genie was at the door, in his chariot drawn by eight hor&s;es. We were a&s;hamed to be found in bed; and ri&s;ing with the utmo&s;t expedition, went out to receive him, with the be&s;t excu&s;es we could make for not being earlier ri&s;ers, and being in waiting for his coming. Four men-&s;ervants followed him into the hou&s;e, bearing
<PB N="169" REF="038495_0168_10123F7658697748">
a trunk, which they &s;at down, and then retired. 'The trunk, and its contents are a pre&s;ent to you, my friends (&s;aid Ravenzar). It contains the mo&s;t valuable of diamonds. Exchange the greater part of them with the jewellers in Bagdad.&mdash;They are worth twelve thou&s;and pieces of gold.&mdash;Share them among the needy and unfortunate. Invi&s;ible pow|ers will direct your minds aright.' 'Ye are our guardian angels! exclaimed Sabina.' 'We are your be&s;t friends on earth, returned he. Un&s;een by you we in&s;truct you; and &s;ave you from innumer|able dangers, of which you are in&s;en&s;ible, and yet we our&s;elves are likewi&s;e in&s;tructed and &s;u&s;tained by &s;uperior power. All the happy intelligences, throughout the creation, of various orders,&punc; are continually &s;erving each other in kinde&s;t offices of love; and are attentive to the affairs of mankind. O! how great is the &s;ource of our be|ing, the Creator and upholder of the Univer&s;e! How good! how kind! how tender!&mdash;It is this&mdash;it is this, my friends, that enflames our love, and in&s;pires us, with unremitting activity, in copying after his works of benevolence and love I Renew then your &s;trength, ye children of my affection&mdash;from the &s;ame divine impetus &punc; in the labours, of your happy choice&mdash;of diffu&s;ing true knowledge and felicity, wherever your influence is appointed to extend!' Breakfa&s;t being ready, we &s;at down; with our re&s;pected gue&s;t, fea&s;ting our minds more rich|ly and luxuriantly with his di&s;cour&s;e; which charm|ed and enlivened, while it in&s;tructed. 'The city of Bagdad, &s;aid he, (re&s;uming his di&s;cour&s;e at the breakfa&s;t table) is large and full of people, of dif|ferent nations and religions as ab&s;urd as they are inimical to the real pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the profe&s;&s;ors. There are a few, however, and but a
<PB N="170" REF="038495_0169_10123F78B77D2F58">
few, who&s;e minds are not wholly perverted by er|roneous principles and depraved manners. Tho&s;e I &s;hall, in a &s;hort time, carry you to &s;ee; that com|mencing friend&s;hip with them, you may become in|&s;trumental of confirming them in real virtue and ju&s;t &s;entiments. The pre&s;ent Sultan is endowed with a great &s;hare of wi&s;dom, con&s;idering in what a depraved world he was brought up, and the ab&s;ur|dities and political errors of the times. He is &s;tu|dying a greater reform among his &s;ubjects; by which, he will an&s;wer the wife purpo&s;es of Heaven, as to future events. He is a friend to liberty, but will by no means &s;ucceed in his endeavours to pro|mote its cau&s;e. His life is thereby endangered: yet Heaven, for its own wi&s;e rea&s;ons, &s;uffers him to be too eager and too violent.'</P>
<P>'To live in a land of liberty, &s;aid Debournon, and under a mild government, where peace and good order are not only objects of &s;olicitous attention, but actually maintained; are temporal ble&s;&s;ings high|ly to be e&s;timated; not the lea&s;t of which is liberty of con&s;cience, and free enquiry.' 'I am going to take you on a tour through Europe in a few days, returned the Genie, and then you will &s;ee what ex|cellent u&s;e men make of liberty, and mild govern|ments. But the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing of mere &s;elfi&s;h things, can be but of &s;hort duration, and their con|tinuance very uncertain. The glory and happine&s;s, derived from undi&s;&s;embled virtue and benevolence, can have no period to their exi&s;tence. They &s;ur|vive the ri&s;e and fall of kingdoms and empires. They reach into eternity! Happy, tho&s;e minds el|evated above the follies and trifles that engage the attention of the greater part of mankind! they are Heaven-taught! they are divine! and are qualify|ing for the regions of uninterrupted bli&s;s! I was intending to &s;ay more of the Sultan, and the influ|ence
<PB N="171" REF="038495_0170_10123F7B3AB9B4E8">
of &s;ome of the principal men of &s;everal nations of Europe, but we &s;hall under&s;tand each other bet|ter, after we have made the tour of Europe. And I fancy, when you are again returned hither, you will be apt to prefer your reclu&s;e &s;ituation, to the fair|e&s;t pro&s;pects you will have found in the civilized nations, who&s;e leading men have been too unfortu|nate in forgetting to take proper care of them&s;elves, before they undertook the care of others. A &s;ad time of blunders, when wi&s;e men and politicians begin at the wrong end! you look as though you wondered how it &s;o happens. But I will tell you the cau&s;e in a few words. They want good hearts. They have exi&s;tence, but know not how to enjoy it: they boa&s;t in them&s;elves, and are ignorant of their own weakne&s;s, and blind to futurity, they &s;et their wills again&s;t God's. Yet for their good we gladly la|bour; and the happy re&s;ult is not far off.'</P>
<P>Ravenzar now ro&s;e from table, and bid us adieu. 'I &s;hall &s;ee you again, in two or three days, &s;aid he, as he entered his chariot, in the mean time, all happine&s;s attend you&mdash;the happine&s;s of virtuous and benevolent minds!'</P>
<P>'But not to weary you with too many particulars of a life of more than two hundred years, let it &s;uf|fice to add&mdash;that, I found my&s;elf va&s;tly improved in knowledge, after travelling, with Ravenzar, through the nations of Europe. On my return, I beheld, with rapture, my Sabina holding two lovely babes in her arms! they were twins, a boy and a girl. No words are capable of expre&s;&s;ing our mu|tual joy on this happy meeting, after an ab&s;ence of near eleven months. But, to contract my relation in as narrow limits as po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;in twenty years, Sabina bore me fifteen children, &s;ix daugh|ters, and nine &s;ons. Ravenzar vi&s;ited us often; and carried away with him all our children as &s;oon
<PB N="172" REF="038495_0171_10123F7D96C18BD8">
as they were arrived to years of di&s;cretion, and &s;et|tled them in different parts of the world, under his particular care and in&s;pection. We were recon|ciled to his proceedings, from the excellent rea&s;ons he produced. But they are now citizens of your Republic, though as yet, to you not per&s;onally known. We &s;hall however, &s;oon be with them there. And then they will be ready to afford you &s;ome agreeable entertainment in the hi&s;tory of their lives, till they commenced citizens of Ravenzar. With their hi&s;tory are nece&s;&s;arily interwoven &s;ome remarkable anecdotes of Sabina and my&s;elf. The Genie carried us, a number of times, to vi&s;it them. Sometimes we travelled with him in his aerial car, at others in his chariot, or on hor&s;eback; which plea&s;ingly varied the delights of our journeys, oc|ca&s;ioning &s;ome curious and profitable, as well as a|greeable adventures. My children's children are likewi&s;e di&s;per&s;ed in various countries. After the &s;ame manner, and for the &s;ame rea&s;ons as were ours, were they &s;eparated from their parents; who, however, cheerfully re&s;igned to &s;uperior wi&s;dom, patiently wait the day when they are to behold them in Ravenzar. Parcellus, the youth before you, is a native of China; and, (however it may &s;urprize my friend) is the brother of Ge&s;&s;eng, the compan|ion of your former travels. He was no one knew how) &s;eparated from his parents, at the age of e|leven. Ravenzar brought him to me, at the age of &s;eventeen. He was my a&s;&s;i&s;tant, friend and com|panion. Here he pur&s;ued his &s;tudies, and made the greate&s;t proficiency in all valuable &s;cience. His mind was early formed to virtue. He is wor|thy of your friend&s;hip and love.'</P>
<P>Nytan aro&s;e from his &s;offa&mdash;'Let me, then, &s;aid he, embrace the brother of Ge&s;&s;eng. You have, continued he, my friend&s;hip, and my love. Hence|forth,

We wait only leave from Ravenzar, replied Debournon.&mdash;But night admoni&s;hes us of re&s;t, and you will not leave us till morning. The grand vizier, promi&s;ed to introduce us to you, and your friends; which I expected he would have done before this.' 'Let us then retire to re&s;t, if you plea&s;e, returned the Prince; tomor|row, I purpo&s;e to bring my friends hither.

<P>THE variety of &s;urpri&s;ing adventures and plea&s;|ing di&s;coveries, con&s;equent upon a morn|ing's excur&s;ion, afforded Nytan the mo&s;t agreeable entertainment, as he walked to the Grand Vizier's &s;eat, after breakfa&s;ting with Debournon, and his engaging little family; to whom he was delight|ing him&s;elf with the thoughts of introducing his friends, as he entered the grand viziers court. Si|lena and Amelia, who &s;aw him, from the window of the apartment in which they were mournfully &s;itting, aro&s;e ha&s;tily, and went out to meet him. Their grief was too great to be concealed, however alleviated by her appearance. 'Alas! cried he, my lovely women! whence the &s;orrow &s;o &s;trongly de|pictured in your countenances, for the fir&s;t time, &s;ince the happy moments that united our hearts in the pure&s;t affection?' O my dear lord, replied Si|lena, (as they mutually embraced) can you inform us of Julia and Maria?&mdash;Julia and Maria! returned he, &s;urpri&s;ed, are they not with you? hath any thing ill befallen our lovely girls?'&mdash;Amelia was &s;peech|le&s;s with grief. She received the embraces of Ny|tan in &s;ilence; but with flowing tears, expre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t affliction. They &s;at down in the
<PB N="175" REF="038495_0174_10123F841881D590">
porch. Be comforted my dear Amelia, &s;aid Nytan. Your nieces, I perceive, have ab&s;ented them&s;elves longer than you expected, and you fear &s;ome di&s;|a&s;ter. But yield not to &s;uch fear. Repo&s;e in hea|ven. At this moment, I perceive my error, which hath occa&s;ioned your affliction.&mdash;My error, return|ed Amelia, in bringing my girls abroad in this evil and di&s;a&s;trous world.' 'Blame not your&s;elf, my dear friend, rejoined Nytan. Of my&s;elf I have had too good an opinion, I only am to blame. Nor will I re&s;t a moment till I re&s;tore your nieces to your arms. Silena, in&s;truct me what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue. I will &s;et out immediately. Where are Philenor and the grand Vizier?' 'They are gone in &s;earch, an&s;wered Amelia.' 'We have, added Silena &s;earch|ed every where in vain. But I am not without great hopes&mdash;if you enquire once more in Bagdad, where they were la&s;t &s;een.'&mdash;Selina then related all that had happened the preceding day, and that morn|ing. 'I go then to Bagdad, &s;aid he, but I conjure you, my dear ladies, he comforted. I &s;hall bring you agreeable tidings.</P>
<P>After &s;ome anxious enquiries, the Prince, by means of his little &s;pying gla&s;s di&s;covered the girls in Philenors new built man&s;ion. He immediately gladdened the hearts of Amelia and his Selina, with a relation of his &s;ucce&s;s, and carried them to De|bournon's At dinner they expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to &s;ee their admired ho&s;t, with his little family &s;ettled in their happy country, and likewi&s;e the grand vizier, whom they equally admired and re&s;pected.</P>
<P>They had &s;carcely ri&s;en from table, when they perceived Ravenzar's chariot. Debournon and Ny|tan ha&s;tened into the court to receive him. Alight|ing from the chariot, he was followed by Parcellus, who then handed out Sabina. 'I picked up the&s;e good people, &s;aid Ravenzar, in yonder field; and I

a&s;&s;ure you, my dear friends, I value my&s;elf on the acqui&s;ition. It is of that ine&s;timable worth that we &s;hould not know how to do without it. Such (contin|ued he, taking a hand of Debournon's, and one of Nytan's, and directing his expre&s;&s;ive eyes on Sa|bina and Parcellus; then on Selina and Amelia, who were advancing towards them, as they walked up the court)&mdash;&s;uch are the links of mutual affection, in which we are united by the divine &s;ource of life and love; that we mu&s;t be inevitably unhappy in the lo&s;s of one. But, the chain of love and friend|&s;hip can never be broken or impaired, by momen|tary &s;eparations, or ca&s;ualties incident to the pre&s;ent &s;tate. It will grow &s;tronger and brighter with the increa&s;e of years, and be perpetuated, through end|le&s;s revolving ages, in the world of perfection. Permit me, my dear friends, added he, (when the la&s;t mentioned ladies joined them) to felicitate you on this happy meeting; and which I may &s;afely venture to &s;ay, we &s;hall ever recollect with plea|&s;ure.' 'It is, I am per&s;uaded, replied Nytan, an un&s;peakable happine&s;s to us all, to &s;ee and hear our noble and generous friend and benefactor. Some of us have been afflicted of late: yet the indulgence of Heaven has converted that affliction into increa&s;|ing joy; and your pre&s;ence, mo&s;t beloved and re&s;|pected friend, exalts it to the highe&s;t.' 'The af|fliction of my friends, and their joy, are mine, re|turned Ravenzar.&mdash;But, added he, perhaps, what I have to communicate, may &s;erve to convince us, that our mutual joy and plea&s;ure is not now &s;o con&s;um|mate, but that it may admit of an higher elevation.' Being entered the apartment, and &s;eated, the Genie continued his di&s;cour&s;e; having by his la&s;t words, excited the curio&s;ity, and rai&s;ed the expectations of every one.</P>
<P>'The time is fulfilled, &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf

to Debournon and Sabina. You are no longer to live in this &s;tate of &s;eparation from your children. I am come to convey you to Ravenzar, and our oth|er friends, excepting Philenor, who will remain with the Grand Vizier, till, with his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, his affairs are &s;ettled; after which the aerial chamber will waft them to the abodes of peace and bli&s;s, to|gether with his &s;on Aleddin. I am further to in|form you&mdash;The Sultan was &s;lain by his jani&s;&s;aries a few hours pa&s;t; &s;o that there can be no &s;afety here for the grand vizier and his &s;on; nor for the amiable Sultana. She is to embark with us, in a ve&s;&s;el of my providing, which waits on the &s;hore. Your e&s;tate here, Debournon, you will not want. I have given it to the two robbers, who would have killed your beloved Parcellus.' He cea&s;ed &s;peak|ing. The company looked a&s;toni&s;hed! but their a&s;toni&s;hment was but momentary. They were too well taught, to mi&s;con&s;true the &s;entiments and in|telligence de&s;igned to be conveyed, in a gayly ab|rupt manner, by the la&s;t words of Ravenzar.&mdash;'O my benefactor and friend! the friend of all! exclaim|ed Debournon, then your beneficence will be rich|ly-repaid;&mdash;incapable as you are of irrational lib|erality. Something &s;ublimely great has influenced your procedure! the robbers then were not actual|ly &s;lain, as we imagined. They live&mdash;but no longer plunderers and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. They greatly live, hap|py converts to virtue, and will become the friends; no more the oppre&s;&s;ors of mankind. It mu&s;t be &s;o. And our joy will be boundle&s;s to day!' So ex|&s;tatic is the plea&s;ure which the reform of the vicious excites in the friends of humanity.</P>
<P>'They are indeed rendered converts to virtue, re&s;u|med Ravenzar. Extreme nece&s;&s;ity drove them to the road for plunder; whil&s;t others were doing the &s;ame,

with more &s;afety, in thrones or temples. While robbers they were under my eye. But I will not de|tain your attention, at pre&s;ent, in relating the means I have u&s;ed with them; the murders I have pre|vented from being perpetrated by their hands. On &s;ome future day, they will have it in their power to entertain you with their own hi&s;tory. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that as they are men of knowledge and penetration; they are likewi&s;e now become men of virtue and benevolence. And, as &s;uch, they are to &s;ucceed my Debournon in the &s;ame labours of love to mankind, in which he hath been here, &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;fully employed. He hath, in Ravenzar, a &s;pacious and delightful man&s;ion prepared; which he will exchange for this, and double the number of acres he enjoyed here; &s;ituated near the road to Terman, and about five miles from that city. The Sultana we &s;hall call upon. And what is there my friend, to hinder our &s;upping to night in Debour|non's man&s;ion in Ravenzar?'</P>
<P>The will of their powerful guardian friend, was to them a law. They learned it with an extatic plea&s;ure, and that night was it happily fulfilled.</P>
<P>Every thing fortunately occurred to ha&s;ten the marriages of the &s;everal parties. Almira, and &s;oon after her &s;i&s;ter Sapphira, embraced their mother, from whom they had been long &s;eparated. Her name was Adeline. She was full of the prai&s;es of the benevolent Ravenzar; who &s;aid &s;he, (relating her &s;tory to Almira) &s;oothed my griefs, a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with his advice, and at lengh conducted me to this &s;a|cred a&s;ylum, placed me in a plea&s;ant village among&s;t men and women, who are more like angels and &s;e|raphs than like children of the earth.' Sapphira had been &s;old for a &s;lave to Mahumed, though never treated as &s;uch. Roderigo was vanqui&s;hed by her beauty and uncommon mental accompli&s;hments

and their union was to take place on the &s;ame day of that of Maria with Alexis, Julia with Aleddin, and Parcellus with Almira. A large and brilliant company were a&s;&s;embled for &s;everal days at Debour|non's; from whence they rode out in parties on different routs. Ravenzar and Parcellus directed their cour&s;e to the boundaries of the i&s;land, on hor&s;e|back, through a va&s;t fore&s;t. I am about to &s;hew you, &s;aid Ravenzar to the latter, my private apart|ments that you may enjoy them at your lei&s;ure, in my ab&s;ence. Then I &s;hall introduce you to the &s;eat of our future re&s;idence, which you will find el|egant, and in every re&s;pect adapted to your ta&s;te. As they rode through the fore&s;t, Ravenzar di&s;cour&s;|ed on the expected future glorious date of the world. 'Many have wrote, &s;aid he, on this &s;ubject; and im|agine it to be only a &s;tate of uninterrupted &s;en&s;ual enjoyments; in which they are greatly deceived. It will be a &s;tate of the &s;ublime&s;t enjoyment, and of the con&s;ummation of every wi&s;h of the heart divine|ly formed for perfect and endle&s;s felicity. It is then the Deity will unfold his beneficent plan. To that &s;tate of perfection all things tend. It is then the divine architect will, with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;kill, adorn his creation in his own beauty and com|line&s;s in the mo&s;t eminent degrees. For this, he began his &s;tupendous work. For this light &s;prang from darkne&s;s, creation &s;hone forth in its various lu&s;tres, and intellectual day dawned upon the world. Nature had been very liberal in the be&s;towment of her gifts on the youth now travelling with Raven|zar. He had a clear perception of moral and natural beauties, and was a mo&s;t affectionate admi|rer of every thing beautiful, grand and &s;ublime. He was enraptured with the magnificent &s;cence of na|ture; and the progre&s;s he had already made in phi|lo&s;ophy, both natural and moral, excited in him a|doring
<PB N="180" REF="038495_0179_10123F90DBE0E2F8">
wonder, and ravi&s;hing delight in contem|plating the great power and goodne&s;s of the crea|tor. The excellent thoughts he expre&s;&s;ed, and his agreeable manners, were highly gratifying to his guardian friend and in&s;tructor. 'My dear Parcel|lus, &s;aid he, words fail to expre&s;s the plea&s;ure I I take in your happy turn of mind, and the improve|ments you have made in &s;cience and virtue. You will be a rich acqui&s;ition to all our dear and worthy friends, and one of the brighte&s;t ornaments of their &s;ociety. Infinitely happy will ye be in each other. Such are the recompen&s;es of attention to the pre|cepts of the wi&s;e; and va&s;t are the advantages you are now going to enjoy in this &s;ecure a&s;ylum from the many evils to which mankind are &s;till &s;ubject. Let us &s;trengthen each others hearts and hands in the performance of our &s;everal duties, co-operating with the Deity in his works of beneficence and love.'</P>

<P>YOU &s;ee yonder towering pile of rocks, who&s;e craggy &s;ummits &s;eem blended with the &s;ilver clouds, &s;aid Ravenzar, as they approached the boun|daries of the i&s;land. It is through <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> we are to enter my apartments. You mu&s;t remain here, whil&s;t I proceed forward to open us a pa&s;&s;age. When it is accompli&s;hed, you will perceive it, and ride up to me. Alight then, my Parcellus, and re&s;t awhile under the&s;e lofty trees, who&s;e tufted foliage will defend you from the meridian rays.' Having &s;aid this, he rode on to the rocks. Parcellus &s;eated him&s;elf on a mo&s;&s;y hillock, under the &s;hade of a Palmetto; &s;o as that he could di&s;tinctly ob&s;erve the Genies progre&s;s. When the Genie was advanced to tho&s;e &s;tupendous rocks, a dark vapour &s;uddenly concealed him wholly from the view of Parcellus. The Heavens lowered and gathered blackne&s;s! A tremendous peal of thunder &s;hook the &s;olid world! All nature trembled around! The youth was &s;eiz|ed with terror and con&s;ternation; It was as uni|ver&s;al ruin had commenced its awful de&s;olating ca|reer! but, &s;oon his fears were di&s;&s;ipated, by the re|turning light, and cheering &s;erenity of day. Ra|venzar again appeared to his view; he beheld a
<PB N="182" REF="038495_0181_10123F9640CF5238">
wide aperture in the rocks, through which the Ge|nie entered, making a &s;ign to him to ha&s;ten forward. Then mounting his hor&s;e he rode on to the aperture; which he had no &s;ooner entered, following Raven|zar, than it was rendered impenetrable by a black, fiery cloud; which &s;erved as a barrier again&s;t any intru&s;ion from without. But it is impo&s;&s;ible ju&s;tly to de&s;cribe the beauty and loveline&s;s of the pro&s;pect before him! The apartments, &s;even in number, &s;tood, at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, in a &s;pa|cious garden, laid out and furni&s;hed with inconceiv|able magnificence and gaity. They were of &s;olid gold; their roofs and windows of pure&s;t chry&s;tal gla&s;s; and partially &s;haded by tall and broad-leaved trees, who&s;e wide &s;preading branches waved gently over them; and had a mo&s;t enchanting effect on the whole &s;cenery to the eyes of tho&s;e either within or without the apartments. The gardens of Nytan, and &s;everal others on the i&s;land, with a number of buildings, are very far from being equalled in any part of the world. But here was a richne&s;s, a lux|uriancy and &s;plendor, exceeding tho&s;e. The groves, the fruit trees, and beds of flowers and fruits, were di&s;po&s;ed with inimitable art. The &s;pacious alleys were of gold and marble. The walls of this gar|den appeared to be of looking-gla&s;s and of a va&s;t height; reflecting the gay and beautiful &s;cenes they enclo&s;ed. At the di&s;tance of about twelve rods from the apartments, and on the right hand, as they advanced towards them, the ground was rai&s;ed a number of feet, with a gradual a&s;cent by &s;everal flights of &s;teps of &s;olid gold; beyond which at &s;ome di&s;tance, appeared, numbers of hills, clothed with verdure, ri&s;ing one above another and bounding the delicious pro&s;pect. Ravenzar and Parcellus, di&s;|mounting their hor&s;es, and turning them loo&s;e on the lawn, over which they had rode, walked to|wards
<PB N="183" REF="038495_0182_10123F982BD9AD70">
the fir&s;t apartment in their way. A beauti|ful youth to appearance, clothed in a white flowing robe, &s;tood at the door. It was E&s;dren: who per|ceiving Ravenzar and Parcellus, advanced to meet them: 'We have been expecting you, my broth|er, &s;aid he, to Ravenzar, but were not aware of your being attended by &s;o lovely a companion, to en|crea&s;e our plea&s;ure.' 'This is Parcellus, replied Ravenzar, of whom you have often heard me &s;peak, your friend and mine.' 'Let me then embrace our friend, &s;aid E&s;dren, folding Parcellus to his bo&s;om. You have other friends within, added he, lovely youth, who will rejoice to &s;ee you; and embrace you with a &s;incere affection.' They then walked into the apartment, where Parcellus was over|whelmed with plea&s;ure, and the care&s;&s;es of the il|lu&s;trious friends of Ravenzar; who were a&s;&s;em|bled, in this paradi&s;e, agreeably to their yearly cu&s;|tom. There were the fairy Perieng, Puria the con&s;ort of E&s;dren, the fairy Leingreing, and five others from the palace of pictures, attended by their hu&s;bands, who had been lately re&s;tored to them; all arrayed in robes; immortal youth and beauty blooming in their countenances! None other, than the regions of the ble&s;t above, could boa&s;t an a&s;&s;em|bly more illu&s;trious and brilliant; of manners and intercour&s;e more refined; or who&s;e mutual en|dearments were more extatic! After they had din|ed, they walked in parties; Parcellus with Raven|zar, and E&s;dren, who undertook to &s;hew him the other &s;ix apartments, which lay in their way, at convenient di&s;tances, and in the mo&s;t delightful &s;it|uations towards each other; having clu&s;ters of tall elms, and other beautiful trees, placed between them, &s;o as to afford an agreeable &s;hade to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ing from one to another. The fourth apartment was the large&s;t; having five galleries, and large clo&s;ets,
<PB N="184" REF="038495_0183_10123F9A9C577670">
one within another, filled with &s;helves of books of the mo&s;t &s;uperior kind. Having vi&s;ited them all, they proceeded forward through the garden, and a&s;cended the hills, from whence they had a com|pleat &s;urvey of the whole garden, and its innumer|able beauties. They &s;eated them&s;elves in an alcove under the &s;hade of mulberry trees, and entertained them&s;elves a long time with the lovely enchanting pro&s;pects. E&s;dren di&s;played the brighte&s;t talents in conver&s;ation, greatly to the in&s;truction of Par|cellus, to whom his di&s;cour&s;e was chiefly directed, &s;peaking of the delightful wonders of the place&mdash;'There was a time, &s;aid he, in my remembrance, (though many ages have &s;ince revolved) when this i&s;land, and mo&s;t of the neighboring continents, were buried in the ocean. By &s;low degrees, in &s;ome places, and in others by &s;udden convul&s;ions, the land emerged from the waters. At that di&s;tant pe|riod, other countries became lo&s;t in the ocean, as the&s;e revived from it.' He enlarged upon the va|rious changes he had ob&s;erved on the face of the globe, and on the revolutions among&s;t mankind: then de&s;canted on the beauties of creation. He likewi&s;e made a variety of &s;ublime ob&s;ervations on the di&s;pen&s;ations of Heaven towards the whole in|telligent creation. Ravenzar had his &s;hare in the con|ver&s;ation; whil&s;t Parcellus was all attention to the great and wonderful things he heard. His memo|ry ever retained the whole, and he then imagined he under&s;tood every thing uttered by tho&s;e &s;ages; who&s;e long experience had perfected them in the knowledge of the force and meaning, both of words and things. But an hundred years after convinced Parcellus, that he had but &s;uperficially and partially under|&s;tood the greater part of the conver&s;ation of that memorable day, evening and en&s;uing morning. Being at length di&s;po&s;ed to walk further&mdash;'Come,
<PB N="185" REF="038495_0184_10123F9DA27DAE70">
&s;aid Ravenzar, I will &s;hew you the baths on the other &s;ide the hills.' They aro&s;e, and, walking through a grove of fir trees, over the &s;ummits of the hills, de&s;cended to the baths, which were &s;ituat|ed under the wall of looking gla&s;s which there ter|minated the garden. Three golden buildings cov|ered the chry&s;tal fountains; on the hither &s;ides of which were rich &s;offas covered with &s;ilk and gold, and tables of &s;olid gold, &s;eparated from the fountains by partitions of gla&s;s, with curtains of green velvet: the roof of each building was of gla&s;s, and arched, like tho&s;e of the &s;even apartments, with the branches of tall and maje&s;tic elms and oaks bending over them. They were &s;urrounded by a &s;pacious lawn, on which were clu&s;ters of palm trees, orange, fig, and other fruit trees. On one &s;ide was a grove of pines, of a young growth, which a&s;cended part of the hills. On the other &s;ide was a wide alley, bordered with flowers, and various kinds of berries of a mo&s;t de|licious ta&s;te. This alley wound round the hills and communicated with others of the garden. 'Here; &s;aid Ravenzar, after refre&s;hing our&s;elves in one of the fountains, we will recline on &s;offas, and wait the arrival of our friends, who have already bathed and pur&s;ued another walk. The ladies will return in carriages for the purpo&s;es of bringing us provi&s;ions and in&s;truments of mu&s;ic: for here we &s;hall &s;pend the afternoon and evening.'&mdash;After they had bathed; Ravenzar opened a clo&s;et door; and &s;hewed a &s;mall library of entertaining volumes. They took each a book, and, reclining on &s;offas, amu&s;ed them&s;elves an hour with reading. After which, they aro&s;e, and a&s;cended the hills, looking round for their friends, who, by this time, &s;aid E&s;dren, mu&s;t be on the way hither. But not perceiving them, they &s;eated them&s;elves in the alcove, and li&s;tened awhile to the charming mu&s;ic of the variety of birds. 'How
<PB N="186" REF="038495_0185_10123F9F44E933C0">
ince&s;&s;ant, &s;aid E&s;dren, are the &s;ylvan chori&s;ters of nature's temple, in the prai&s;es of the creator! how lively and animating their notes; as if they emulat|ed the cele&s;tial mu&s;icians, who &s;weep their golden lyres in the heavenly temple above!&mdash;but &s;ee, our friends are approaching who will begin their melo|dious concert when the feathered &s;ong&s;ters &s;hall have cea&s;ed; not to re&s;ume their &s;prightly lays till the morning's dawn. Let us join our company on foot while the ladies proceed forward in their carriages, and make ready our evening's repa&s;t.' Being unit|ed, they took a different alley from that which the carriages pur&s;ued, which led them round the hills, on the right hand, through &s;everal delightful groves, and prolonged their walk till the ladies were pre|pared to &s;et at table. Having arrived, they all &s;at down to coffee, wine and cakes. All the variety of birds &s;eemed to have a&s;&s;embled on the trees, in that delicious rece&s;s below the hills, to regale them with their &s;weete&s;t melody! They advanced as near as po&s;&s;ible to the apartment, perching on the branches that hovered over and around it; exerting them|&s;elves, as in&s;pired with fre&s;h vigor to rai&s;e their highe&s;t and mo&s;t melodious notes, the nearer the hour of their re&s;t approached. The ravi&s;hed Parcellus could not refrain from expre&s;&s;ing it as his opinion, that the birds had attained a skill and vivacity be|yond their ordinary reach. It is really &s;o replied the fairy Perieng. Our pre&s;ence and the divine complacency, in&s;pire and exalt them; the divine complacency, which delights in rewarding our faith|ful and indefatigable labours for the good of man|kind, with &s;uch plea&s;urable retirements, as this, for our relaxation, by means of which we renew our &s;trength and vigor to pur&s;ue the works of ben|evolence and love.'</P>
<P>After their repa&s;t was fini&s;hed, &s;ome of the com|pany
<PB N="187" REF="038495_0186_10123FA1D7C9DFD0">
joined in a concert of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic; which with agreeable intervals of conver&s;a|tion, la&s;ted till day began to appear, and the milder &s;plendors of the moon to give way to brighter glo|ries. They returned to their partments; where the company taking leave of Ravenzar and Parcel|lus, a&s;cended their &s;plendid cars, and di&s;appeared. Parcellus lamenting their departure, expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf in the following extemporary di&s;tich, with flow|ing tears.&mdash;</P>
<Q><L>No glorious things can ever long remain:</L>
<L>The meteors &s;hine and di&s;appear again.</L>
<L>So deare&s;t, kinde&s;t friends alas! mu&s;t part;</L>
<L>Leave me to fruitle&s;s tears, and aching heart!</L></Q>
<P>'Your lines, ob&s;erved Ravenzar, are true with regard to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world. But it is a &s;tate that will &s;oon be over. Then all will be like us.&mdash;Come, my Parcellus, let us return to our lovely friends at Debournon's. Do you not long to &s;ee them? 'Indeed I do, my kind patron, re|plied he. Their company will reconcile me to the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e who have ju&s;t left us.' 'We &s;hall return in a four-wheeled carriage, re&s;umed Ravenzar. I have &s;undry articles to convey to your man&s;ion, to which I &s;hall carry you; it being &s;it|uated but half a mile on one &s;ide of our road. A carriage will likewi&s;e follow us with two large che&s;ts filled, the one with gold the other with dia|monds, for your u&s;e.' He then touched with his fore-finger a little golden ball, that hung by a wire to one of the pillars of the &s;offa on which they were &s;itting; immediately the &s;ound of a large bell was heard, as at di&s;tance: and pre&s;ently a door opened, and two &s;ervants appeared. Ravenzar ordered two four wheeled carriages to be made ready, the two
<PB N="188" REF="038495_0187_10123FA38863B098">
che&s;ts to be placed in one of them, and a trunk, that he de&s;cribed in another. 'And, added he, let eight &s;ervants be ready to attend me.' The &s;ervants in|&s;tantly di&s;appeared to fulfil his orders. 'While they are obeying my orders, &s;aid Ravenzar, I will &s;hew you where my &s;ervants live. When, at any time, in future you are here, and want attendants, you have only to touch this golden ball, and a &s;ervant will appear, and call others if you &s;hall have occa|&s;ion for them.' Saying this they de&s;cended a &s;tair ca&s;e, through the door by which the &s;ervant entered. At the bottom of the &s;tair-ca&s;e was a long gallery. They walked through it to an opening, which brought them into a &s;pacious lawn, where &s;tood four hand&s;ome buildings of grey marble. They entered the fir&s;t in their way; in which were two young men and women &s;itting at breakfa&s;t. 'We are come, &s;aid Ravenzar, to breakfa&s;t with you this morning.' 'You greatly honor your &s;ervants, re|plied one of the young men, who are always rejoic|ed to &s;ee our good ma&s;ter and his friends.' This he &s;aid ri&s;ing and placing two chairs at the table in which Ravenzar and Parcellus &s;eated them&s;elves; the young women pre&s;enting them with tea, cakes and honey. Ravenzar and Parcellus conver&s;ed with them with the greate&s;t cheerfulne&s;s and familiarity. When they had all breakfa&s;ted Ravenzar conducted his friend attended by the two young men, into the fields, cultivated by his &s;ervants, which were ex|ten&s;ive, and in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition. 'There is not now time, &s;aid the Genie, to view the mines of gold, and the pits where the diamonds are gathered, and the various employments follow|ed here. But my people will &s;hew you every thing at &s;ome other time.' A number of men and wo|men of very agreeable appearances, came from the other hou&s;es to pay their re&s;pects to their beloved
<PB N="189" REF="038495_0188_10123FA7567EAAC0">
employer, who received them with an affectionate regard; and ble&s;&s;ing them, he, with Parcellus, at|tended by the two young men, ha&s;tened back to the &s;tair ca&s;e, where the young men took their leave, and returned to their hou&s;e. 'Some of my people, &s;aid Ravenzar, at proper &s;ea&s;ons, work in my gar|den, keeping it always in good order. But none of them are seen, at any other time, above the&s;e &s;tairs, except when called. Their cheerful labours &s;upply me with whatever I want, while here; and they are amply rewarded; living always in plenty, and happy in each other. Their fields and habita|tions, are enclo&s;ed, on one &s;ide, by the wall of my garden; and, on the other, by the mountainous rocks which bend their craggy &s;ummits over the o|cean. Here is the broade&s;t exten&s;ion of the&s;e rocks, which run further, by a mile, into the i&s;land, than in any other part of it.'</P>
<P>The two carriages and the &s;ervants being ready, they entered them and &s;at forward for the aperture; four of the &s;ervants attending on hor&s;eback When arrived to the Aperture, the Genie pronounced &s;ev|eral words, and the clouds retreated on one &s;ide to make way for the carriages and hor&s;emen. As &s;oon as all were pa&s;&s;ed through, the cloud re&s;umed its &s;tation. As they pur&s;ued their way, Ravenzar pre|&s;ented Parcellus with a medal.&mdash;'On this medal, &s;aid he, are engraved the words which I u&s;ed for the removing the cloud. You will therefore be &s;ure to have it with you, my friend, whenever you &s;hall de&s;ign entering my apartments. But, &s;ee, before us, your buildings. They &s;tand in a gar|den of two hundred acres. We will, now, but ju&s;t look at them, depo&s;it the che&s;t and trunk, and give orders to the eight &s;ervants, henceforwards yours, and then ha&s;ten on to our dear friends.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="038495_0189_10123FA8F6A019B0">
Having viewed the buildings and gardens, and de|po&s;ited the trunk and che&s;sts, they expedited their cour&s;e to Debournon's.</P>
<P>On the evening following the marriages were &s;olemnized in the pre&s;ence of great numbers of con|gratulating friends. They were the next evening, to meet in Nytan's palace.</P>
<P>It was a mo&s;t agreeable entertainment to tho&s;e illu&s;trious friends on the intervening day, to read a paper publi&s;hed by Philenor, and di&s;per&s;ed in his native country, and the neighbouring kingdoms, and to learn the recent events con&s;equent upon it, which, at once &s;hew in a &s;triking light the depravi|ty of human nature; and how ineffectual, and to them&s;elves fatal, is the rage and vengeance of the &s;ons of pride again&s;t the children of virtue under the immediate protection and guardian&s;hip of hea|ven. The paper was entitled The Remembran|cer, of which the following is a part.&mdash;</P>
<P>'By that wi&s;dom which never errs is it decreed, that every atom of the creation, and every intellec|tual as well as &s;en&s;itive exi&s;tence, performs their de&s;tined rounds.

We have learned from every age (as far as hi&s;tory in&s;tructs) the awful effects of living without that attachment to the Supreme, which a|lone in&s;ures human felicity. Why are we no bet|ter improved by experience of pa&s;t times and our own? Is it that the mo&s;t dreadful de&s;truction is to reprove the ab&s;urdity and perver&s;ene&s;s of our tem|pers, the madne&s;s of our conduct?</P>
<P>The Deity is infinitely good and kind, as infin|itely perfect and glorious. To re&s;emble him is man's happine&s;s, his honor, his greatne&s;s. Alas! we are poor reali&s;ers of the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of exi&s;|tence, and cele&s;tial liberality. We are &s;hamefully unmindful of him who taught our &s;ouls to think! No wonder therefore we are mi&s;erable; no won|der we are &s;o di&s;appointed, embarra&s;&s;ed, bla&s;ted in our projects and pur&s;uits. In vain do we look for tranquility and bli&s;s, whil&s;t we re&s;pect not, love not the author of our being. What then is our re|ligion, of which we make &s;uch a parade? What the wor&s;hip we offer to Heaven? How much more like true wor&s;hippers would your religious a&s;&s;em|blies appear, did they meet, both rich and poor, on the appointed days, like affectionate brethren; in the genuine &s;pirit of love, relieving every want, en|couraging each other in true virtue and real good|ne&s;s with the &s;weetly per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence of the heart? then would they unque&s;tionably chant forth the &s;ongs of acceptable prai&s;e, and the air would re&s;ound with truly &s;acred melody. Then would they utter a thou&s;and charming things, &s;uch as an|gels might with delight and admiration li&s;ten to hear. New &s;cenes of plea&s;ure would open, as yet to them unknown. Then would they di&s;cern, that in each other, which the Deity beholds as infin|itely attractive&mdash;beauty and charms that never

cloy or fade. Such is the only wor&s;hip by Heaven approved. Away then&mdash;forever away with that dete&s;table kind by which divinity and humanity are in&s;ulted.&mdash;* * *</P>
<P>* * *&mdash;O ye rulers!&mdash;Ye rich and influ|ential! Is it not high time ye learned wherein true grandeur con&s;i&s;ts? How far are ye from entertain|ing ju&s;t ideas of living&mdash;of plea&s;ure&mdash;policy&mdash;oecon|omy&mdash;of virtue&mdash;of humanity&mdash;of true glory! oth|erwi&s;e, would ye re&s;t day or night, till by the &s;pirit of the Eternal, ye became well in&s;tructed to ble&s;s mankind?

<P>But this is but a &s;lender part of that intere&s;ting and alarming paper. The enraged powers &s;ent out va&s;t fleets to de&s;troy Ravenzar. They could never find it. A dreadful &s;torm di&s;per&s;ed them. They all mi&s;erably peri&s;hed. Such is the inevitable doom of the implacable enemies of God and man!

<P>EARLY in the evening the company were a&s;|&s;embled in Prince Nytan's hall. It is ea&s;i|er to imagine than de&s;cribe the refined &s;ocial plea|&s;ures of tho&s;e illu&s;trious friends, who with heaven's propitious &s;miles, had attained to the accompli&s;hment of their utmo&s;t wi&s;hes. Selina made a number of rich pre&s;ents to the newly married ladies, mo&s;t el|egantly adapted to the friend&s;hip and the liberality of her heart. Several weeks they pa&s;&s;ed together in a round of convivial plea&s;ures in the palace and in the city. But the Prince was now &s;uddenly cal|led away to the continent of Africa In the height of &s;weete&s;t &s;ocial bli&s;s, the deare&s;t friends mu&s;t part, and cheerfully &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, yield to Heaven's great behe&s;ts. A courier, &s;wift as the wind, had brought intelligence of an alarming nature.&mdash;'I am in&s;tant|ly to leave you my happy friends!&mdash;It is your glo|ry and mine that &s;ummons me hence; &s;ince we

are alike deeply intere&s;ted in the felicity of man|kind, and, under the direction of the &s;overeign parent, ince&s;&s;antly employed in promoting its weal, in preventing or mitigating its woe. Dire mi&s;|chief lours tremendous where we have been long labouring to in&s;ure mild virtue's tranquil reign! In &s;ilence, with pity's &s;ofte&s;t eye, you urge me to be gone; nor reluctant do I obey.'&mdash;It was thus Ny|tan bid his gue&s;ts adieu. He re&s;ted on the Afri|can &s;hore in Zanger's favored realm, and on the &s;pot where his royal friend had erected, in honor to his memory, a magnificent dome, and where, at the in&s;tant of his arrival, he re&s;ided. Enraptured he embraced his mo&s;t beloved of friends.</P>
<P>After mutual care&s;&s;es, Zanger ha&s;tily informed his friend of what he already knew too well; that Mingeng, (the King who&s;e hi&s;tory a preceeding page has introduced) was depo&s;ed and bani&s;hed his kingdom, now di&s;tracted and torn by party rage, and in danger of &s;oon becoming a prey to &s;urround|ing barbarous nations.</P>
<P>'Hinder me not a moment cried Nytan, I mu&s;t in&s;tantly be gone. On my return I am to take you, my dear Zanger, to our happy i&s;le, where my friends long to embrace you.'&mdash;He was &s;oon in the mid&s;t of the divided people. Sea&s;onable was his pre&s;ence, and happy in its con&s;equences was his benevolent interpo&s;ition. The leading men of each party he highly blamed, accu&s;ing them roundly of &s;hameful|ly di&s;ingenuous conduct towards each other, as un|happily hath in civil di&s;&s;entions, been too often the ca&s;e). All were highly incen&s;ed again&s;t him, and began to threaten his life. But they were ignorant of his worth, his abilities and powerful re&s;ources&mdash;in peace or war&mdash;in the cabinet or in the field; and how ea&s;ily he could fru&s;trate their nefarious pur|po&s;e. At the mo&s;t intere&s;ting cri&s;is he appeared in

their a&s;&s;embly, and having &s;olicited attention, de|livered the following memorable oration, with that pathetic all-commanding eloquence &s;o peculiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Re&s;pected citizens, the freedom of my interpo|&s;ition, I perceive, hath excited again&s;t me your re|&s;entment. Yet &s;uffer me once more to addre&s;s you, before I bid you adieu. Alas! what are men, when hurried and agitated by impetuous pa&s;&s;ions. You are dear to me as my own exi&s;tence; &s;ince we all are the indulged children of one common parent, that glorious being from whom originates every thing great, every thing good, every thing amiable and lovely. We mu&s;t re&s;emble our kind beneficents Creator, to be happy, to be honorable. Our devi|ation from rectitude is certain incalculable mi&s;ery and di&s;grace. But let us no longer deceive our|&s;elves, nor forget we are accountable for our ac|tions. Alas! it is high time the nations were ful|ly awakened to &s;entiments more becoming the dig|nity of their nature as the offspring of Heaven! How incon&s;i&s;tent hath our tempers and conduct been towards each other?&mdash;Incon&s;i&s;tent with what we would be, and with what we are &s;o ready to flatter our&s;elves we are! men of virtue and honor, great and good! We differ in our political views; and we are ever irritating each other by in&s;ulting language. From the public adverti&s;ers how &s;hame|fully is it evidenced. I have &s;een your re&s;entments and your per&s;onal altercations! In &s;ecret I wept&mdash;my heart bled for my brethren!</P>
<P>By what motives are we actuated in our politi|cal exertions? We, who profe&s;s to glory in virtue, genero&s;ity, courage, magnanimity;&mdash;in being pat|riots, philanthropi&s;ts? Of what &s;pecies is our future public and private felicity to con&s;i&s;t? You have peru&s;ed hi&s;tories, and have learned the follies of pre|ceding

times.&mdash;Are we never to be really wi&s;e and good; to ri&s;e &s;uperior to the degrading &s;olicita|tions of fal&s;e ambition, or &s;en&s;uality? And are we created only to wrangle and fight, afflict and devour each other? Wherefore do we pretend to po&s;&s;e&s;s the noble-exalted rational powers, while we thus act like irrationals?&mdash;If we po&s;&s;e&s;s a courage and fortitude to ri&s;k our health, our limbs and lives in ho&s;tile conflicts; to endure every thing in arduous, hazardous enterprizes;&mdash;Why have we not the cou|rage to arre&s;t the fatal deranging progre&s;s of cow|ardly &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s? The man uninfluenced by a &s;in|cere, undi&s;&s;embled philanthropy, (which indeed ex|i&s;ts not but with every virtue) however he may plume him&s;elf, and figure in the world, is but a cowardly pu&s;illanimous wretch: and, &s;ooner or la|ter, in the pre&s;ence of &s;uperior beings, he mu&s;t be covered with &s;hame. Nothing can be more true, or more worthy of &s;olemn thought.&mdash;What <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> have &s;uch multitudes of us been about? Im|mortal beings! gloriou&s;ly formed, when fir&s;t pro|duced from Deity's pla&s;tic hand! What, my breth|ren, have we been pur&s;uing! Alas! it is true that we have been pur&s;uing only our &s;hame!&mdash;Can there be any thing more contemptible in the eyes of the glorious and beneficent beings who encompa&s;s the eternal throne, than tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h minds that prefer their own gratifications to the good of thou&s;ands, whom they might greatly &s;erve by their affectionate attentions, and reform by their precepts and engag|ing examples? But we, by our temper and con|duct, and &s;ordid private views, are bla&s;ting every benevolent purpo&s;e of the generous heart. What a di&s;graceful circum&s;tance is it&mdash;how ba&s;e and pregnant with the mo&s;t terrific ruin&mdash;that the di|vine gifts of &s;peech and language are pro&s;tituted to the cruel murderous purpo&s;es of &s;lander and de|famation!

<P>But how, &s;ay you, &s;hall we induce each other to think alike, (who entertain &s;uch oppo&s;ite &s;enti|ments) and annihilate party &s;pirit?</P>
<P>Let us ponder well the dire re&s;ult of our pre&s;ent conduct. Let us with &s;olemnity apply to the &s;ource of wi&s;dom. To its guidance we mu&s;t yield, or be inevitably undone: to exi&s;t without it is dreadful; there are deepe&s;t horrors in the idea!</P>
<P>O my friends! let us ponder well at this mo|mentous cri&s;is! let us be awakened to &s;alutary healing truth before it be too late; nor plunge madly into di&s;tre&s;&s;ing de&s;olations beyond concep|tions the mo&s;t terrible! let us henceforth, then, unite in cheri&s;hing the &s;acred gentle &s;pirit of love. Let us determine to act di&s;intere&s;tedly;&mdash;to conduct as in the pre&s;ence of innumerable glorious pure and happy intelligences, who ever lean on om|nipotence; and as in his pre&s;ence. Who&s;e all per|vading eye &s;earches into the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of every heart. Let us for ever bani&s;h, (from this moment) pride and vain glory, and little-&s;ordid &s;elf with all the cowardly fears that always attend it. Let us have done with every &s;pecies of vice and intemperance. True temperance will be attended with every virtue&mdash;every attractive grace. Few indeed can be fairly allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o ine&s;tima|ble a gift of Heaven. Ignorant of its excellencies, men have not de&s;ired it;&mdash;they have not therefore a&s;ked it. For the &s;incere reque&s;t would never have been denied by the &s;ource of tenderne&s;s and love. A ju&s;t temperance would render us tranquil, &s;erene and happy. It would meliorate our hearts.

It would regenerate us, and render us divine. Yet every &s;en&s;e would be regaled with the variety of delicacies which liberal nature yields. But without a genuine temperance we can enjoy nothing. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, we &s;hall en|joy all things. Freed from the &s;olicitations of fal&s;e appetites, and racking de&s;ires, and of con&s;equence, from expences that oppre&s;&s;ion only can &s;upport; we &s;hall really po&s;&s;e&s;s more to enjoy, as we &s;hall have more to give;&mdash;like the giver of all, exi&s;ting to relieve the helple&s;s, and communicate happine&s;s. We &s;hould then ta&s;te the bli&s;s, we &s;hould prove the enrapturing felicities of wi&s;dom and philanthropy, divine, and no longer labour and rage to oppre&s;s and de&s;troy each other.

But the reputed temperance is below the grade to which I would have you &s;oar. The truly temperate enjoy perpetual health, have the due com|mand of the pa&s;&s;ions; and practice, with &s;ublime&s;t plea&s;ure every virtue.

and happy. What wonders the moving elo|quence of the heart and tongue accompli&s;h when employed on a &s;ubject like this! The bani&s;hed and depo&s;ed king was immediately recalled and rein&s;tat|ed. Nytan &s;wayed every mind. It was influ|ence he merited there to hold. And, though him&s;elf united to a Republic (great indeed) in &s;tronge&s;t bands of love, he attempted not innovations. The monarchy was rendered there propitious and hap|py, becau&s;e the people became the children and &s;ub|jects of undi&s;&s;embled virtue. To leave his new converts in the pur&s;uit of virtue, wi&s;dom and know|ledge, was his aim: and, happy con&s;equent events in that kingdom a future page may unfold. At pre&s;ent, the narrator hath arrived to the utmo&s;t lim|its of his intelligence. The &s;ucce&s;sful philanthro|pi&s;t, after three days, took leave of Mingen and his grateful applauding &s;ubjects, and repaired to the centre of a va&s;t wilderne&s;s of Africa, in which, en|vironed by impa&s;&s;ible rocks and impervious woods, the &s;plendors of Ravenzars palace glittered to the &s;un. Prince Nytan now for the fir&s;t time beheld it, being previou&s;ly informed of its &s;ituation by that illu&s;trious friend. There, &s;ecluded from the world, a large &s;ociety, con&s;i&s;ting of both &s;exes, were train|ing up, by Ravenzar, for the republic. Ravenzar was pre&s;ent to receive the friend of his heart. Sev|eral days they conver&s;ed together on &s;ubjects of highe&s;t import. After which, and having been mo&s;t agreeably entertained by the &s;ociety, they took leave of each other, and Nytan ha&s;tened to king Zanger, who fea&s;ted him two days with truly royal magnificence, all the principal men and women of the court being pre&s;ent. Yet was it a fea&s;t where true temperance pre&s;ided, however unu&s;ual at the tables of the great; and from which every one re|turned happy, rational and divine.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="038495_0200_10123FC0C023C058">
On the morning the king took leave of the court, and with Nytan, followed by the ble&s;&s;ings of the people, bid a long farewell to the continent of Af|rica.</P>
<P>'How ble&s;t exclaimed Zanger (as they gently prog|re&s;&s;ed through the air) are tho&s;e who render the pow|ers of art and &s;cience conducive to human felicity. What advantages have we in Africa thereby ob|tained. And what an acce&s;&s;ion of happine&s;s is thence derived to two powerful nations!' 'It is indeed glorious for us, replied his friend, that the divine gifts have enriched us with the power and the di&s;|po&s;itions to &s;erve each other. Ever new and en|rapturing are the &s;en&s;ations of the benevolent mind. Divine love in&s;pires its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors with all that is great and good: it views every object in its its true light; and con&s;tantly reali&s;es the delightful truth that the creator beholds, in the children of humanity, forms infinitely lovely and engaging; and, by his wonder-working power, moulds and refines them to perfect purity and innocence; a|dorning them in his own comeline&s;s, and rendering them for ever lovely to each other. Such a view animates us to every po&s;&s;ible exertion in &s;erving each other: and we contemplate, with horror and di&s;dain, tho&s;e &s;en&s;ual indulgencies which effemin|ate the mind, and cau&s;e it cowardly to &s;hrink from philanthropy's glorious, unparalleled career. Dif|ficulties &s;erve but to invigorate our re&s;olution, and &s;trengthen our confidence in the Supreme. What rich ble&s;&s;ings grow upon mankind from the multi|plied deeds of benevolence! their increa&s;ing hap|py effects both on the receiver and the be&s;tower, may be compared to tho&s;e prolific germs, which from the &s;lendere&s;t &s;ize advance in growth till they become the mo&s;t beautiful and the mo&s;t fruit|ful

of trees. But here the compari&s;on fails. Tho&s;e trees, however ornamental and u&s;eful, mu&s;t decay and die: but the works of benevolence undecaying flouri&s;h; and are the permanent &s;ources of plea|&s;ures the mo&s;t refined. The delightful &s;en&s;ations, ari&s;ing from the works of charity, are indeed di|vine. From the &s;ource of love and kindne&s;s they originate; and, like every thing divine, they for|ever exi&s;t, and forever beatify the beings in who&s;e brea&s;ts they are naturali&s;ed! How glorious is it, my friend, to be employed in the important work, however arduous, of correcting the errors of man|kind, of awakening their attention to virtue, of promoting univer&s;al peace and harmony! though it be indeed the mo&s;t difficult of all works. How long are men gaining ju&s;t ideas of virtue and hap|pine&s;s! ideas &s;ufficiently powerful to rouze all the energies of their minds to action! What difficult|ties ari&s;e from pa&s;&s;ions and the ignorance and de|pravity of men! but the more difficult the work, the more glorious will it appear in its final accom|pli&s;hment by the great, the wonder-working pow|er of God, with whom we co-operate. Its difficul|ty, yea, impo&s;&s;ibility, with us alone, and the num|berle&s;s impeding cau&s;es of genuine reform, lead us to reflect how con&s;ummate mu&s;t be the bli&s;s when it is univer&s;ally effected.</P>
<P>'Our growing numbers are indeed a &s;acred pow|erful confederacy of illu&s;trious per&s;onages under a divine influence, again&s;t every &s;pecies of vice and oppre&s;&s;ion; aconfederacy not only for our own feli|city, but for the promotion of real virtue and good|ne&s;s, and for the relief of the wretched, the de&s;ti|tute and the oppre&s;&s;ed, in every region. And, as it intrudes not on other nations, or &s;ocieties, it is it&s;elf &s;ecured again&s;t every foreign intru&s;ion. Guid|ed by the mo&s;t perfect wi&s;dom, and actuated by the

Every individual of our nation is well known to the admini&s;trators of the government, is indu&s;tri|ous, virtuous and happy. It contains the greate&s;t geniu&s;es of both &s;exes.&mdash;Such are Xarien Lateur, Zanthus, Debournon, and many others, by whom I have the happine&s;s to be always encircled, be&s;ides great numbers who live in the di&s;tant towns, villa|ges and cities.&mdash;Such are Zurien, Aranthus, Pherr|deng, and the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed women. A long li&s;t I might produce of female worthies, who&s;e ex|cellent precepts and examples are eagerly followed by every one of that amiable and re&s;pectable &s;ex. The Philanthropic &s;on of Renien was upon his fa|favorite topics. Zanger was mo&s;t plea&s;ingly enter|tained, who&s;e mind was formed to virtue and ben|evolence. He expatiated, in his turn on the de|lightful themes.&mdash;Prince Nytan pur&s;ued &s;everal excellent thoughts of his friend with the mo&s;t in|&s;tructive and charming eloquence.

<P>ZANGER, having by the aid of Pharenon, ac|quired the European languages, had made the grand tour. In which he &s;aw indeed, much to admire, but more to lament. Nothing excited in him more of &s;urpri&s;e and re&s;entment than tho&s;e principles, and that conduct, which tended to era&s;e the belief of the &s;ouls immortality, and of the Dei|ty's kind attentions to the works of his own hands; tho&s;e tenets which are e&s;tabli&s;hed indeed, by Di|vine authority, in the heart of every citizen of Ra|venzar. 'One would think &s;aid he, it were impo&s;|&s;ible that men of &s;en&s;e and learning could enter|tain the idea, that beings capable of &s;uch ennobling energies; refined &s;entiments and endearing affec|tions, as are evidently the human &s;pecies, were de|&s;igned for the enjoyment only of a temporary exi&s;|tence, and then utterly to peri&s;h, to be forever ex|punged from the creation. No wonder, continued Zanger, men of &s;uch &s;entiment are among the chief oppre&s;&s;ors of mankind, the perpetual plagues of &s;o|ciety.' He became however, acquainted with a
<PB N="207" REF="038495_0206_10123FD00BD7B530">
few of tho&s;e: who were worthy of his e&s;teem and affectionate attention. Yet no &s;ociety of men in the world appeared to him comparable to this, in which, through the friend&s;hip of Prince Nytan, he was now initiated. And he could not refrain from renewed expre&s;&s;ions of the high admi|ration and exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure with which he was affected, as they walked on to the pavilions of Le|ingreing, their common benefactre&s;s, 'O my friend, cried he, with what ravi&s;hing plea&s;ureable &s;en&s;ations am I overwhelmed, in beholding the un|rivalled charms of your country! wherever I walk, here, I meet only endearing countenances, encoun|ter kinde&s;t greetings; and am received with the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable, the mo&s;t cordial entertainment in every dwelling I enter. Here all is perfect love and &s;weetne&s;s! and the women&mdash;never did I be|hold more lovely! They are rather cele&s;tials, who have conde&s;cended to dwell on the earth to con&s;ole, to harmoni&s;e, to beatify mankind! What won|ders would a party of the&s;e angels effect, in the re|gions which gave me birth! their divine allure|ments would be irre&s;i&s;tible&mdash;the tout-en&s;emble of their matchle&s;s per&s;onal and mental charms&mdash;their &s;uperior knowledge, their per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, their unparalleled mode&s;ty, engaging manners and virtuous examples!&mdash;It mu&s;t be &s;o, my dear Prince&mdash;our fleet mu&s;t bear away a few of the&s;e invalua|ble commodities; &s;ince you have already told me, it is in contemplation in your a&s;&s;embly to &s;ettle &s;ev|eral families abroad, at different future periods, for the mo&s;t benevolent purpo&s;es.'</P>
<P>'And would it not, think you, replied Prince Nytan, be very hard parting with citizens, with friends &s;o dear?' 'The love of true glory, replied the king, removes every difficulty. Neither, my friend, would it be &s;o very hard parting, &s;ince all
<PB N="208" REF="038495_0207_10123FD28FC65C50">
would often meet again, notwith&s;tanding the great di&s;tance of the countries from each other. Be&s;ides, we are to reckon the peculiar plea&s;ures of epi&s;to|lary corre&s;pondence.' 'You argue eloquently, re|turned the philanthropic friend, and, I believe, when you make your benevolent and patriotic claim, it cannot fail of being approved and &s;anctioned with|out a di&s;&s;enting voice. Our females will indeed be excellent in&s;tructre&s;&s;es and guards to youthful age again&s;t the errors to which they are liable. They will &s;ea&s;onably relieve them from the often fatal effects of tho&s;e s&s;udden and unlooked-for incidents and a&s;&s;aults on their minds, which have deranged youth, who have, with determined &s;teps, &s;at out in the career of virtue, and have not been &s;ufficiently watched again&s;t by either parents, in&s;tructors, or guardians, in the countries, where I have vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>Zanger was about to introduce the former &s;ub|jects of di&s;cour&s;e when Nytan placed in his hands an epi&s;tle wrote by Amelia, to a young female whom &s;he had educated, and who re&s;ided with Randor in her former man&s;ion. 'This epi&s;tle, &s;aid the Prince, is a valuable &s;pecimen of the ideas with which our women in&s;pire their children. Amelia is an ex|cellent tutore&s;s. But we have many &s;uch in our country. Heaven is peculiarly intere&s;ted in the education of our children, and hath ble&s;&s;ed them with wi&s;e, faithful and indefatigable in&s;tructors and in&s;tructre&s;&s;es. Indeed there is not one amon&s;t them but might well a&s;toni&s;h, and put to the blu&s;h, the be&s;t in the mo&s;t civili&s;ed nations.

<HEAD>AMELIA to CHLORIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Chloris,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay in epi&s;tolary writing is beyond expectation agreeable. You will give me leave, in an&s;wer, to continue the important &s;ubject with which you concluded.&mdash;</P>
<P>Nature, ever attentive to her children; in&s;truct|ing each individual of all the immen&s;e variety of be|ings; inciting it to tho&s;e actions and di&s;po&s;itions which e&s;&s;entially contribute to, and con&s;titute its fe|licity; to our &s;ex &s;he points the mo&s;t rational con|duct and motives; &s;ea&s;onably advi&s;es us of every deviation from the path of rectitude. The happy ea&s;e and &s;erenity of the mind is proportionate to its attention to her &s;alutary dictates. Revere, my Chloris her &s;acred friendly voice. Obey her im|portant injunctions; in every in&s;tance yield to her pointed intimations. She invites our &s;ex to aim at every excellent accompli&s;hment, to become rich|ly adorned with all the amiable graces and virtues. Nor does &s;he leave us ignorant, that the genuine, ruling motive for acquiring every mental charm, mu&s;t be indi&s;putably, the lively con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its being plea&s;ing to the infinitely lovely and be|nificent author of our exi&s;tence; who, as he is the &s;ource of every perfection, (him&s;elf&punc; the perfection of beauty and loveline&s;s) infinitely and immutably great and glorious, good and kind; it becomes his grateful daughters whom he hath ble&s;&s;ed with an|gel forms, to love him &s;upremely; to a&s;pire, with the mo&s;t fervent ardor, to plea&s;e him who fir&s;t and be&s;t de&s;erves to be plea&s;ed. They &s;hould therefore, be ever &s;tudious to render them&s;elves lovely and all accompli&s;hed ultimately for his &s;ake. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="210" REF="038495_0209_10123FD75AEAAFA0">
this exalted &s;entiment, they may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to enjoy real felicity; &s;ince it divinely excites them to pur&s;ue, with unremitted zeal, the career of true virtue and honor; a&s;piring after that &s;plendid fame which is celebrated in the regions of con&s;ummate glo|ry and bli&s;s; exerting every energetic power to digni|fy each revolving day and year by tho&s;e virtuous and benevolent actions which will be pronounced intrin&s;ically valuable in future worlds, and prove to them riche&s;t &s;ources of joy innumerable ages hence. Thus, my Chloris, to live is to live to God, to the happy country we are de&s;tined to adorn, and to the world; and ju&s;tly to merit that di&s;tingui&s;hing and inchanting appellation&mdash;The fair part of the crea|tion; to be hourly improving in mental beauty and lu&s;tre; to &s;hine with a &s;till brighter and more ra|diant effulgence, till the illu&s;trious day of Heaven unfolds to our enraptured &s;ight! This is to an&s;wer the grand purpo&s;e of our exi&s;tence: this is to do ju&s;tice to our&s;elves, to the world, to its Creator.</P>
<P>How unnatural then, how uncharacteri&s;tic mu&s;t it appear, in a beautiful and accompli&s;hed female, (contemplating, in &s;ome retired moment, her own per&s;onal and mental attractions) to refrain addre&s;|&s;ing, with a fervent and grateful adoration, the di|vine author of her exi&s;tence, the underived origin of beauty and lu&s;tre ineffable, which irradiates intelli|gences around his throne; and who hath &s;o happily formed her mind and per&s;on, endowing her with the capability of higher perfections, and of approv|ing her&s;elf to him by every purpo&s;e of her heart, every action of her life. For this only, my amiable Chloris, let us <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and de&s;ire to live; to honor our beneficent creator, who hath &s;o highly honored us, in be&s;towing upon us &s;o re&s;pectable an exi&s;tence, and &s;o admirably forming the creatures of his pow|er and love;&mdash;to love him &s;upremely; to copy af|ter

him in his endearing expre&s;&s;ions of love and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The more we &s;tudy the creator, the more &s;hall we re&s;emble him. For the greater our advances in that knowledge of him, which ari&s;es from the contemplation of the immen&s;ely varied di&s;plays of his perfections, the more forcibly will his di&s;cerned beauties and excellencies attract our admiration and love; and, the object we mo&s;t admire and love, we &s;hall be ever principally &s;olicitous to imitate. What an immen&s;e, &s;tupendous plan of beneficence hath the Deity formed! What a profu&s;e di&s;play of won|ders&mdash;of benevolence, doth the univer&s;e exhibit to each intere&s;ted &s;pectator of its va&s;t and magnificent &s;cenes! all is the ine&s;timable product of infinite, of unchangeable goodne&s;s and love, and &s;urely, the more diligently we &s;tudy the divine benevolence in its multiform, grand and engaging di&s;plays, the more fervent will be our ardors, and the more generous our exertions in copying after tho&s;e exqui&s;itely wrought patterns exibited for our imitation, by that incomprehen&s;ibly glorious being, who enthroned with ineffable &s;plendors on high, is perpetually dif|fu&s;ing every form of happine&s;s through unnumber|ed worlds!&mdash;Let us my dear, with wonder&mdash;with awe&mdash;with gratitude&mdash;contemplate the rank we hold, and are de&s;tined to hold in the va&s;t uni|ver&s;e of God; and beware of entertaining too ex|alted an opinion of our&s;elves. Beings greatly &s;u|perior to us, notice our behaviour, and are intere&s;t|ed in our felicity, and Heaven's all-pervading eye penetrates the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of our hearts; in which he requires, and even &s;olicits the free&s;t re&s;|idence, and from which he would debar the minut|e&s;t and mo&s;t concealed &s;eat for pride and vanity. Neither are we to de&s;pi&s;e any of the inferior be|ings, from the unwarrantable conceit that we are

more worthy, more beautiful or happier than they. All the infinitely various orders of exi&s;tences, from the mo&s;t elevated Arch-angel down to the meane&s;t in&s;ect, po&s;&s;e&s;s their peculiar excellences and feli|cities; even the reptiles, from which we have been apt to &s;hrink with loathing, and innumerable wing|ed and creeping animals &s;carcely vi&s;ible to the &s;ight, (be&s;ides countle&s;s animalculae too minute for our &s;urvey, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome advantages of which we are in|capable, and enjoy perhaps, greater degrees of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure than our con&s;tructure allows us.
