<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author declares his abhorrence of a bigotted attachment to the low &s;ingulari|ties of a party, and profe&s;&s;es to act on the bene|volent and catholic principles of the go&s;pel; therefore hopes his readers will not conceive any obnoxious idea from the word CHURCH, as he u&s;es it in this di&s;cour&s;e, nor indulge or give way to jealou&s;y and prejudice &s;o far, as once to &s;u&s;|pect, that he means by this term, to point out any one denomination of Chri&s;tians, exclu&s;ive of all others&mdash;as di&s;tingui&s;hed by their location and other peculiarities. The church, in his &s;en&s;e of it, includes all the worthy profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;ti|anity, who conduct them&s;elves on their probation here, as tho&s;e that expect to be judged hereafter, by the great evangelical law of liberty. He fully believes the Apo&s;tle, when he &s;ays, "where the &s;pirit of the Lord is, there is liberty;" and doubts not, but this &s;pirit has been plentifully poured out, not only in the New-England colo|nies, but likewi&s;e on his Epi&s;copalian brethren in
<PB REF="015082_0004_0F95AAAD72844040">
the Southern provinces, for whom he has the highe&s;t e&s;teem and affection, and would not for his right hand, &s;peak or write any thing that might give umbrage or ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to &s;uch worthy patriots, &s;o ardently engaged in the common cau&s;e, and u&s;ing &s;uch vigorous, &s;pirited exertions for the defence and pre&s;ervation of A|merican liberty.&mdash;He is fully convinced of the ab&s;olute importance of uniting in the mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip, as chri&s;tian brethren and fellow-coun|trymen, in this glorious conte&s;t and &s;truggle, and fully &s;en&s;ible, that to give the ark a wrong touch in this critical moment, might be of un&s;peakably dangerous con&s;equence&mdash;But, however, appre|hends no hazard or danger of being mi&s;guided by the &s;criptures of truth, which con&s;ideration, amid&s;t all his diffidence, has prevailed with him to comply with the importunity of &s;ome of his friends, in con&s;enting to this publication. His earne&s;t wi&s;h and daily prayer is, that all differences and di&s;putes may terminate in the firme&s;t union and harmony of tho&s;e colonies, and that liberty inviolate, may be &s;ecured to every individual of every denomination, &s;o long as &s;un and moon &s;hall endure.</P>

<BIBL>REVELATION xii. 14, 15, 16, 17.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that &s;he might fly into the wilderne&s;s, into her place; where &s;he is nouri&s;hed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the &s;erpent. And the &s;erpent ca&s;t out of his mouth water as a flood, after the woman; that he might cau&s;e her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and &s;wallowed up the flood which the dragon ca&s;t out of his mouth. And the dragon was worth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her &s;eed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS prophetic book is entitled, The Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which he &s;ent and &s;ignified to his &s;ervant JOHN, by his angel; and which he received when in a &s;tate of bani&s;hment, in the i&s;le called Patmos, for the word of God, and the te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It plea&s;ed the All-wi&s;e and Omni&s;cient God, to give to this his faithful &s;ervant, a very full and glorious vi&s;ion of the things which then were, or of the &s;tate of the church at that time; and of the things which &s;hould be hereafter, or the then future &s;tate and condition of the church,
<PB N="8" REF="015082_0006_0F95AAAF9FE65608">
the &s;ea&s;ons of its flouri&s;hing and pro&s;perity, and of its declen&s;ion; its trials and &s;ufferings to the end of the world. Which vi&s;ion he was ordered to write, for the in&s;truction, &s;upport, and con&s;o|lation of God's &s;aints, in the wars and conflicts they might have with their enemies, in every age and period of time, till the old &s;erpent, the great dragon &s;hould be entirely overcome, and his king|dom compleatly de&s;troyed. "And ble&s;&s;ed is he that readeth, and they that hear the WORDS of this prophecy, and keep tho&s;e things which are written therein; for the time," that is, of their accompli&s;hment, "is at hand." The diligent and &s;erious &s;tudy of this &s;acred book ought not to be neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed, nor the things it contains be viewed as idle &s;peculations, and vain empty amu&s;ements; but every man is bound in duty, to attend to the things contained herein, as to matters of great importance, with all the wi&s;dom, &s;obriety and reverence he is capable of. It may with propriety be &s;tiled, "The &s;ure word of prophecy." The apo&s;tle John was &s;o highly favoured, as to behold a door opened in heaven; &s;o near to which he was brought as to look in, and &s;ee the glorious things tran&s;acted there, to confirm his &s;aith as to the truth of the&s;e won|derful predictions and prophecies to be accom|pli&s;hed on earth. Chap. iv. 1. and the fir&s;t voice which he heard, was as of a trumpet talking with him, which &s;aid, "Come up hither, and I will &s;hew thee things which mu&s;t be hereafter." Ac|cordingly God di&s;covered to him all the mo&s;t re|markable events that &s;hould befal his church, and the nations and kingdoms of the world, even to the clo&s;ing period when the angel &s;hould &s;tand up and &s;wear, that time &s;hould be no more:
<PB N="9" REF="015082_0007_0F95AAB1452C3418">
Which things he was ordered to pen down in dark, emblematical, and figurative language, the meaning of which, tho' it cannot be fully com|prehended in the pre&s;ent dark &s;tate of the church; yet may be &s;o far under&s;tood as to afford much &s;upport and encouragement to God's people in times of their greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and &s;uffering, and tend to e&s;tabli&s;h their belief of the truth of this part of divine revelation, and of the ruling pro|vidence of God which is con&s;tantly at work to fulfil and accompli&s;h the events herein predicted and foretold.</P>
<P>WITH a view to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in forming ju&s;t con|ceptions of the nature and de&s;ign of the&s;e pro|phecies and predictions, and to lead us to a right improvement of &s;uch providences of God by which they are fulfilled, I &s;hall make two or three ob&s;ervations, before I proceed directly to explain the pa&s;&s;ages that have been read.</P>
<P N="1">1. I WOULD ob&s;erve with all judicious com|mentators and expo&s;itors that have wrote on the &s;ubject, that Popery, or the reign and kingdom of the man of &s;in, the old &s;erpent, the dragon, its ri&s;e and progre&s;s, and its downfal and over|throw, is the greate&s;t, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, and the mo&s;t &s;triking part of this revelation of St. John. There has been a mortal enmity between the &s;eed of the woman, and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent, ever &s;ince the fall of man, and the promi&s;e of a Sa|viour for his recovery. The old &s;erpent, who &s;e|duced man by his temptations, to fall, has ever been u&s;ing his &s;ubtility and malice to defeat the purpo&s;es of divine grace, and to de&s;troy Chri&s;t's kingdom on earth; and has, in all ages of the world, been &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;tirring up agents and
<PB N="10" REF="015082_0008_0F95AAB1F9F134C8">
in&s;truments to accompli&s;h this diabolical and hell|i&s;h de&s;ign. Among all his crafty and &s;ubtle in|ventions, popery, which exalts the principal lead|ers and abettors of it, high in the honours and emoluments of this world, &s;eems mo&s;t cunningly devi&s;ed, and be&s;t adapted to an&s;wer his purpo&s;e; and has proved the mo&s;t formidable engine of terror and cruelty to the true members of Chri&s;t's church. And this has been the chief &s;ubject of prophecy &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t; and was foretold by &s;ome of the prophets under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation. And whatever difficulty and per|plexity there may be in many of the&s;e dark, my&s;terious pa&s;&s;ages, yet in this view, the appli|cation of mo&s;t of them is rendered ea&s;y and ob|vious. As popery has been the greate&s;t enemy, and the greate&s;t corrupter of chri&s;tianity, we may rationally conclude that more prophecies relate to that, than to any other di&s;tant event.</P>
<P>BY carefully reading and &s;tudying the prophe|cies given forth by Daniel, by St. Paul, and more fully by St. John, it will appear to be clearly and evidently foretold, that &s;uch a power as that of the Pope of Rome &s;hould be exerci&s;ed in the Chri&s;tian church, and &s;hould authori&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch doctrines and practices as are pub|licly taught and embraced by the wicked, corrupt members of that mother of harlots and abomi|nation. The time al&s;o is &s;ignified when, and how long it &s;hould prevail; and that at la&s;t, upon the expiration of this term, it &s;hould be de&s;troyed forevermore.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS popi&s;h my&s;terious leaven of iniquity and ab&s;urdity, by which the Chri&s;tian religion has been &s;o awfully adulterated and corrupted, has
<PB N="11" REF="015082_0009_0F95AAB2DD88F190">
not been confined to the boundaries of the Roman empire, nor &s;trictly to the territory of the Pope's u&s;urped authority and juri&s;diction; but has &s;pread in a greater or le&s;s degree, among almo&s;t all the nations of the earth; e&s;pecially among&s;t the chief rulers, the princes and noblemen thereof. When this great whore of Babylon, or papal Rome is de&s;cribed, Rev. xvii. 1. her bewitching, infatu|ating enchantments are &s;aid to be &s;uch, that the kings of the earth have been enticed, and in|flamed in their wicked lu&s;ts, to that degree as to have committed fornication with her; and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication or whoredom. They have been &s;o far corrupted and debauched by this mother of harlots, as to &s;acrifice every dictate of religion and rea&s;on, and even common &s;en&s;e, to tho&s;e alluring arts with which &s;he has been tempting them. The prophet I&s;aiah had long before this, foretold, "That &s;he &s;hould turn to her hire, and commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world, upon the face of the earth." I&s;aiah xxiii. 17.</P>
<P>WHEN the great red dragon, de&s;cribed, Revel. xii. having &s;even heads, and ten horns, and &s;even crowns upon his heads, made his fir&s;t public ap|pearance, his tail drew a third part of the &s;tars of Heaven, and did ca&s;t them to the earth. The apo&s;tle, under the&s;e &s;ymbolical characters and at|tributes of the great red dragon, undoubtedly meant to point our Satan or the Devil with his agents and in&s;truments, who are acting the part of avowed enemies to the church of Chri&s;t; and his drawing the &s;tars of Heaven with his tail, mu&s;t mean his &s;ubjecting the princes and potentates of
<PB N="12" REF="015082_0010_0F95AAB3791F9C88">
the earth, with great numbers of the clergy, to his tyrannical influence and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;cheme of government. The prophets often de&s;cribe the per&s;ecuting enemies of the church, under this emblem and figure. P&s;alm lxxiv. 13. "Thou breake&s;t the heads of the dragons in the waters, &amp;c." And when God comes to de&s;troy the&s;e ene|mies, he is &s;aid "to cut Rahab, and to wound the dragon," I&s;aiah li. 9. &s;ee al&s;o Ezekial xxix. 3. "Thus &s;aith the Lord God, behold, I am again&s;t thee Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the mid&s;t of his rivers, which hath &s;aid, my river is mine own, and I have made it for my&s;elf." When the frightful mon&s;ter of a bea&s;t, in &s;uch terrible array, is de&s;cribed, Rev. xiii. The dragon is &s;aid to give him his power, and his &s;eat, and great authority; and all the world wondered after the bea&s;t; and &s;aid, "Who is like unto the bea&s;t? Who is able to make war with the bea&s;t?" Which expre&s;&s;ions denote the great extent of his power and dominion, as well as the blind infatuation of his deluded &s;ubjects who made their boa&s;t of it. It is added, "And power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations, and all that dwell upon the earth, &s;hall wor&s;hip him, who&s;e names are not written in the book of life, of the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world." Now, it can admit of no doubt, but that there are multi|tudes of this character in other nations and king|doms, be&s;ides papal Rome. This is further evi|dent from chap. xiv. 8. when the angel comes to proclaim the fall of Babylon, the rea&s;on given why God thus proceeded in righteous vengeance and wrath, is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "Becau&s;e &s;he made all
<PB N="13" REF="015082_0011_0F95AAB5228182E8">
nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her for|nication." Her's was a kind of Circean cup, as one ob&s;erves, with poi&s;oned liquor, to intoxicate and inflame mankind to &s;piritual fornication. The prophet Jeremiah hath a&s;&s;igned much the &s;ame rea&s;on for her de&s;truction, chap. li. 7. "Ba|bylon hath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that made all the earth drunk; the nations hath drunken of her wine, therefore the nations are mad." When the &s;ixth angel poured out his vial, Rev. xvi. Three unclean &s;pirits like frogs, are &s;aid to come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the bea&s;t, and out of the mouth of the fal&s;e prophet, which are &s;aid to be &s;pirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of God Almighty. The&s;e unclean &s;pi|rits here compared to frogs, a very low-lived, inferior kind of animals, who are peeping and croaking in the dark holes and corners of the earth, mo&s;t probably repre&s;ent popi&s;h, Je&s;uitical mi&s;&s;ioners, or the tools and emi&s;&s;aries in general, of anit-chri&s;tian, tyrannical power, who are the &s;pirits of devils, and have free acce&s;s to the kings of the earth, and are &s;aid to be gone forth through the whole world, and are indu&s;triou&s;ly u&s;ing all their mo&s;t artful &s;tratagems, and diabolical craft and &s;ubtility, to impo&s;e upon mankind, and to engage them in the &s;upport and defence of the kingdom of Satan, in oppo&s;ition to the mighty ho&s;t mar&s;halled up by the Lord Almighty, for the overthrow and de&s;truction thereof. The&s;e &s;cripture prophecies and predictions that have now been cited, to which more might be added, were
<PB N="14" REF="015082_0012_0F95AAB5D2D99790">
it nece&s;&s;ary, make it abundantly evident and ma|nife&s;t that the anti-chri&s;tian, tyrannical &s;cheme of popery, in one &s;hape and form, and another, was to have a very exten&s;ive &s;pread and influence, not only thro' the territories of papal Rome, but thro' all the nations and kingdoms of the world in general, and that the kings and princes of the earth, as well as their &s;ubjects, were to be much intoxicated and infatuated therewith; to the great di&s;tre&s;s and perplexity of the true chuch of Chri&s;t, which, &s;o far as I have been able to ob&s;erve, has not been &s;uitably noticed and attended to by ex|po&s;itors and divines that have wrote on the &s;ub|ject; the want of which has occa&s;ioned much per|plexity and ob&s;curity in their comments on &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, which, in the right view of them, are full of &s;ignificance and importance. For in&s;tance, that pa&s;&s;age in the xiii. chap. of this my&s;terious book, where the image of the bea&s;t is &s;poken of, "I con|fe&s;s," &s;ays a great expo&s;itor, "I know not what the image of the bea&s;t is, di&s;tinct from the bea&s;t it&s;elf." The rea&s;on of which was, no doubt, his limiting and confining the&s;e prophecies to &s;o narrow a cir|cle, as papal Rome. Every man of common &s;en&s;e, knows that the image of a thing is &s;ome|thing different from the thing it&s;elf. Therefore, to make &s;en&s;e of the language here u&s;ed, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the apo&s;tle intended to de&s;cribe ano|ther per&s;ecuting tyrannical power, in &s;ome nation or kingdom of the world, which was a lively figure and re&s;emblance of that exerci&s;ed at Rome, the head-quarters of tyranny and per&s;ecution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the appendix.</NOTE>. Whe|ther that per&s;ecuting power be intended, that has in years pa&s;t, been &s;o cruelly and barba|rou&s;ly

exerci&s;ed in France, and other popi&s;h coun|tries, again&s;t the humble followers of Chri&s;t, to the ma&s;&s;acre and de&s;truction of &s;o many thou|&s;ands of prote&s;tants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the war with the Albigen&s;es and Walden&s;es, there were de&s;troyed of them, in France alone, one million,</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t in&s;titution of the JESUITS, to the year 1450, that is, in little more than thirty years, nine hundred thou|&s;and orthodox Chri&s;tians, were &s;lain. In the Netherlands alone, the Duke of ALVA boa&s;ted, that within a few years, he had di&s;patched to the amount of thirty &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ouls; and tho&s;e all by the hand of the common executioner. In the &s;pace of &s;carce thirty years, the INQUISITION de&s;troyed, by various kinds of torments, a hundred and fifty thou&s;and chri&s;ti|ans. Be&s;ides the&s;e, an innumerable multitude have been per|&s;ecuted to death, throughout all Europe, by the cruel hand of tyranny and per&s;ecution. As to the number that have been, and may yet be &s;lain in America, in the war and conflict with the bea&s;t, and the image of the bea&s;t, it cannot yet be a&s;certained.</P></NOTE>; or whether there be a refe|rence to the corrupt &s;y&s;tem of tyranny and oppre&s;|&s;ion, that has of late been fabricated and adopted by the mini&s;try and parliament of Great-Britain, which appears &s;o favourable to popery and the Roman catholic intere&s;t, aiming at the exten&s;ion and e&s;tabli&s;hment of it, and &s;o awfully threatens the civil and religious liberties of all &s;ound pro|te&s;tants; I cannot po&s;itively determine. But &s;ince the prophe&s;ies repre&s;ent this wicked &s;cheme of anti-chri&s;tian tyranny, as having &s;uch an exten&s;ive and univer&s;al &s;pread over the earth, like Nebu|chadnezzar's tree which reached unto heaven, and the light thereof to all the ends of the earth, it need not appear &s;trange or &s;hocking to us, to find that our own nation has been, in &s;ome degree, in|fected and corrupted therewith, and that &s;ome of our princes and chief rulers have had a criminal conver&s;e and familiarity with the old mother of harlots; and been &s;ipping of the golden cup of
<PB N="16" REF="015082_0014_0F95AAB833146A80">
her fornication, &s;o as to be intoxicated, if not whol|ly drunk with her poi&s;onous liquors. Before what is called the reformation, the man of &s;in reigned triumphant in our mother-country, without much check or controul; which reformation was not &s;et on foot on the pure&s;t principles of genuine chri&s;ti|anity, nor carried to perfection by King HENRY the Eighth, who is &s;o celebrated as the author of it. In the reign of Queen MARY, the doctrine and ceremonies of the catholic religion were re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and the Pope's authority and juri&s;diction acknowledged in full; and a very cruel, &s;evere per&s;ecution rigorou&s;ly carried on again&s;t the in|nocent, con&s;cientious profe&s;&s;ors of the prote&s;tant religion; and a mo&s;t tragical &s;cene of blood&s;hed and &s;laughter exhibited, as ever England beheld.</P>
<P>IF we pa&s;s from this dark and bloody period of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, and come down to the reign of the STUART family, we &s;hall find three or four of our kings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, &s;educed and infatuated by the enticing and bewitching inchantments of the old whore of Babylon, to that degree, as to drink deep of the intoxicating wine of her fornica|tion, to the entire de&s;truction of two of them; and to the great di&s;tre&s;s of the nation in general. How far the pre&s;ent mini&s;try have walked in this enchanting road, and how fond they are of the kind embraces of this old filthy harlot, the world will judge from their open attempts to propagate and e&s;tabli&s;h popery, that exotic plant, in the&s;e northern regions; which is not a native of our be|nign &s;oil, nor of our heavenly Father's planting; and their gathering up of armies profe&s;&s;edly Ro|man catholics to dragoon us into &s;lavery and bon|dage, or ma&s;&s;acre and butcher us and our fami|lies,

SINCE the&s;e prophecies and predictions, re|lating to the trials and &s;ufferings, the wars and conflicts of the church with her anti-chri&s;tian enemies and adver&s;aries, may be ju&s;tly taken in &s;uch a large, exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e and latitude; we may rationally conclude that many of them have re|ference to the &s;tate of Chri&s;t's church, in this American quarter of the globe; and will &s;ooner or later, have their fulfilment and accompli&s;h|ment among us. The providences of God in fir&s;t planting his church in this, then howling wilderne&s;s, and in delivering and pre&s;erving of it to this day, are in a manner unequalled, and mar|velous; and are reckoned among the mo&s;t glori|ous events that are to be found in hi&s;tory, in the&s;e latter ages of the world. And there are doubt|le&s;s yet more glorious events in the womb of providence, which the pre&s;ent commotion thro' the nation and land may (however unlikely in the view of &s;ome) be the means of bringing to pa&s;s. There is no part of this terraqueous globe better fitted and furni&s;hed in all e&s;&s;ential articles and ad|vantages, to make a great and flouri&s;hing empire; no part of the earth, where learning, religion, and liberty have flouri&s;hed more for the time. And as to the rapid increa&s;e of its inhabitants, and &s;wift population, it cannot be paralleled in all hi&s;tory. There is no part of the world where its inhabitants, through &s;uch a large extent of territory, are under &s;uch bonds and obligations, from &s;elf-intere&s;t, to keep in the &s;tricte&s;t union and harmony together. They have every motive and inducement to this, that can well be conceived
<PB N="18" REF="015082_0016_0F95AABB3B39BA58">
of. And this union, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, is become as general, perfect and complete, as could well be expected in &s;uch a corrupt di&s;order|ed world as this in which we live.</P>
<P>THESE United Colonies have ari&s;en to &s;uch a height as to become the object of public atten|tion thro' all Europe, and of envy to the mother from whence they derived; who&s;e unprovoked attack upon them in &s;uch a furious ho&s;tile man|ner, threatening their entire ruin, is an event that will make &s;uch a black and dark period in hi&s;tory, and does &s;o deeply affect, not only the liberty of the church here in the wilderne&s;s, but the pro|te&s;tant cau&s;e in general, thro' the chri&s;tian world, and is big with &s;uch con&s;equences of glory or terror, that we may conjecture at lea&s;t, without a &s;pirit of vanity and enthu&s;ia&s;m, that &s;ome of tho&s;e prophecies of St. John may, not unaptly, be applied to our ca&s;e, and receive their fulfil|ment in &s;uch providences as are pa&s;&s;ing over us.</P>
<P>I DO not mean to undertake a nice, exact cal|culation of the periods pointed out in this pro|phetic book; nor to range thro' the hi&s;tory of the world for events to find their accompli&s;hment. I am of opinion, that the church of Chri&s;t in every age, may find &s;omething in this book applicable to her ca&s;e and circum&s;tances; and all &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages that are &s;o, may lawfully be applied and improved by us accordingly. There are many ca&s;es which happen, that bear a near likene&s;s and re&s;emblance to each other, and which the &s;ame prophecy may well &s;uit, in the mo&s;t material parts of it. It has plea&s;ed that God who exerci&s;es a univer&s;al providence over all things, &s;o to di&s;po&s;e and order events, that the calamities and afflictions
<PB N="19" REF="015082_0017_0F95AABCCFC049A0">
of the church, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, run parallel one to another; and all the former efforts of that tyrannical per&s;ecuting power, called the <HI>bea&s;t,</HI> may be the types and figures, as it were, of his la&s;t and general effort again&s;t the faithful witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t, and the true members of his church.</P>
<P>THESE preliminary ob&s;ervations may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in explaining and improving the&s;e prophecies of St. John; particularly the pa&s;&s;ages that have been read, to the con&s;ideration of which I now pro|ceed.</P>
<P>VERSE 14. "And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that &s;he might fly into the wilderne&s;s, into her place, where &s;he is nouri&s;hed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the &s;erpent."</P>
<P>THE woman in this pa&s;&s;age, is repre&s;ented in ver&s;e 2. as in a pregnant &s;tate, travailing in birth, and in violent pangs to be delivered, which is doubtle&s;s de&s;igned as an emblem of the true church of Chri&s;t. She is el&s;ewhere &s;poken of as the &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t, who owns him&s;elf to be her head and hu&s;band. A woman, we know, is the weaker &s;ex, and looks to her hu&s;band for &s;upport and protection. So the church has always been the weake&s;t part of the world, in her&s;elf con&s;ider|ed, and had her dependence on Chri&s;t her head, for pre&s;ervation and &s;afety in times of peril and danger. This woman, the church, being in &s;uch a near relation to Chri&s;t, the brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, and expre&s;s image of his per&s;on, amid&s;t all her own natural weakne&s;s and infirmity, has never appeared contemptible; but the mo&s;t glorious &s;ociety that ever exi&s;ted in our world. She is the king's daughter, <HI>all glorious within.</HI> She
<PB N="20" REF="015082_0018_0F95AABE6D86F3F8">
is &s;poken of, ver&s;e 1. as being cloathed with the &s;un, and having the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve &s;tars; which is a magnificent de&s;cription of her comeline&s;s, beauty and lu&s;tre. She is enlightened, inve&s;ted and adorned with the rays of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which makes her form illu&s;triou&s;ly bright and maje&s;tic. She is in &s;uch a &s;tate of dignity and triumph, as to have the moon, with all &s;ublunary enjoyments and ter|rors, under her feet. And on her head, to com|pleat her glory, a crown of twelve &s;tars, an em|blem of her being under the light and guidance of the twelve in&s;pired apo&s;tles, who had been im|proved as ma&s;ter-builders under Chri&s;t, in laying the foundation of this honourable &s;ociety, and were &s;uch u&s;eful and di&s;tingui&s;hing ornaments to it. One would think that &s;uch a &s;ociety as this, would have nothing to fear from all the combined powers of earth and hell; and indeed, they have not in reality, &s;ince &s;tronger is he that is for them, than tho&s;e that are again&s;t them. How|ever, they are not exempted from trials and &s;uf|ferings in this world. We find, when the great red dragon appeared with his &s;even heads and ten horns, that frightful mon&s;ter the devil in&s;tigated the tyrannical per&s;ecuting powers of the earth, again&s;t this harmle&s;s and innocent woman, the amiable &s;pou&s;e of Chri&s;t. He had impudence and boldne&s;s enough to make an unprovoked at|tack upon her, which occa&s;ioned her to leave the imperial and wealthy abodes of earthly grandeur and magnificence, the courts and palaces of em|perors and princes, and retired to &s;ome ob&s;cure, &s;olitary condition, for the &s;weets of liberty and
<PB N="21" REF="015082_0019_0F95AABED5C80108">
peace. This furious attack of the great dragon on the woman, was an event of &s;uch importance, as to produce war in Heaven between the angels of light, and the angels of darkne&s;s. See ver&s;e 7. "Michael and his angels fought again&s;t the dragon; and the dragon fought, and his angels." This Michael was the tutelar angel and protector of the Jewi&s;h church. Daniel x. 12. And he performs here the &s;ame office of champion for the Chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P>He, and the good angels who are &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter to the heirs of &s;alvation, were the invi&s;i|ble agents on one &s;ide, as the devil and his evil angels were on the other. The vi&s;ible actors in the cau&s;e of chri&s;tianity, were believers, whether in a civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical character, with the glo|rious martyrs and confe&s;&s;ors. And in &s;upport of the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, were the per&s;ecuting powers of the world, with the whole dark train of the artillery of hell. In this great conflict and war, let it re|late to what period of the church it will, which I am not anxious to determine with mathematical certainty; we find that tho&s;e on the &s;ide of God and true religion, overcame their formidable ene|my, with all his confederate powers, by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their te&s;timony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. They were of &s;uch a brave, heroic &s;pirit, as to cheerfully expo&s;e them&s;elves to the greate&s;t dan|gers in this glorious cau&s;e; and many of them actually met death in the terrible conflict. But they fell, as one ob&s;erves, to ri&s;e, and triumph, and reign. The dragon being thus defeated and vanqui&s;hed at his head-quarters, pagan or papal Rome: He takes a wider &s;cope and range, thro'
<PB N="22" REF="015082_0020_0F95AABF7A3D2E00">
the other nations and kingdoms of the earth. He was doubtle&s;s greatly enraged at the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his fir&s;t encounter, and mar&s;hals up all his forces abroad, and proceeds with violence, to per&s;ecute the woman which brought forth the man-child. Upon this the woman has a &s;econd flight into a more di&s;tant and &s;olitary wilderne&s;s, "unto her place;" to prepare her for which, two wings of a great eagle were given her, which is not men|tioned in her fir&s;t flight; and probably &s;he did not then need them. There &s;eems an evident al|lu&s;ion here, to what God &s;aid to the children of I&s;rael, Exod. xix. 4. after their deliverance from cruel oppre&s;&s;ive &s;lavery in Egypt, when encamp'd before Sinai, and on their way to the good land of Canaan, "Ye have &s;een what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles wings, and brought you unto my&s;elf." He was not con|ducting them from a land of liberty, peace, and tranquillity, into a &s;tate of bondage, per&s;ecution and di&s;tre&s;s; but on the contrary, had wrought out a very glorious deliverance for them, and &s;et them free from the cruel hand of tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion, by executing his judgments in a mo&s;t terrible and awful manner, on the Egyptians, their enemies; and was now, by his kind provi|dence, leading them to the good land of Canaan, which he gave them by promi&s;e, for an everla&s;t|ing inheritance. Hence, as the trials and &s;uffer|ings of the Chri&s;tian church were parallel in &s;ome mea&s;ure, with tho&s;e of the Jewi&s;h, and there is a great &s;imilarity and likene&s;s in the manner of God's dealings with the one to the other; it mu&s;t be evident, that expo&s;itors have been mi&s;taken, when they repre&s;ent this flight of the woman into
<PB N="23" REF="015082_0021_0F95AAC041B466C0">
the wilderne&s;s, as denoting the church's going into greater peril, danger and affliction, where &s;he was to be more violently di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted, for a long time. The word WILDERNESS might po&s;|&s;ibly &s;ugge&s;t to their delicate, but inattentive minds, this frightful and &s;hocking idea. It is true, our fathers had the difficulties of an uncul|tivated wilderne&s;s to encounter; but it &s;oon, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven on their labour and in|du&s;try, became a plea&s;ant field or garden, and has been made to blo&s;&s;om like the ro&s;e. The pa&s;&s;age, in its mo&s;t natural, genuine con&s;truction, contains as full and ab&s;olute a promi&s;e of this land, to the Chri&s;tian church, as ever was made to the Jewi&s;h, of the land of Canaan. It is, in an appropriated &s;en&s;e, "her place;" where &s;he is nouri&s;hed, from the face of the &s;erpent. And the dealings of God in his providence, in bringing his church from a &s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution, into this good land, are very parallel and &s;imilar to his dealings with the I&s;raelites, in delivering them from the tyrannical power of the haughty, cruel monarch of Egypt, and conducting them to the good land of promi&s;e in Canaan. Thus, they that wait on the Lord, &s;hall renew their &s;trength; they &s;hall mount up with wings, as eagles; they &s;hall run, and not be weary, they &s;hall walk and not faint.</P>
<P>THUS the church, in this difficult, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ea&s;on, whenever it happened, was &s;upported and carried, as it were, on eagles wings, to a di&s;tant remote wilderne&s;s, for &s;afety and protection. And what period or event is there in all the hi&s;tory of her trials and per&s;ecutions, which the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions more exactly de&s;cribe, and to which they can be
<PB N="24" REF="015082_0022_0F95AAC1431C7A70">
applied with more truth and propriety, than to the flight of our fore-fathers into this then howling wilderne&s;s, which was a land not &s;own nor occu|pied by any ruling power on earth, except by &s;avages and wild bea&s;ts? It is an indi&s;putable fact, that the cruel hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny and per&s;ecution drove them out from their plea|&s;ant &s;eats and habitations, in the land of their nativity; and that the pure&s;t principles of religi|on and liberty, led them to make the bold adven|ture acro&s;s the wide Atlantic ocean; for which they &s;urely needed the two wings of the great eagle, to &s;peed their flight, and to &s;helter and co|ver them from danger, while &s;eeking a &s;afe re|treat from the relentle&s;s fury and &s;hocking cruelty of the per&s;ecuting dragon; and a &s;ecure abode for unadulterated chri&s;tianity, liberty and peace. It is remarked by the in&s;pired penman of this pro|phecy, and is worthy of notice, that when the woman fled into the wilderne&s;s, &s;he came INTO HER PLACE. This American quarter of the globe &s;eemed to be re&s;erved in providence, as a fixed and &s;ettled habitation for God's church, where &s;he might have property of her own, and the right of rule and government, &s;o as not to be controul'd and oppre&s;s'd in her civil and religious liberties, by the tyrannical and per&s;ecuting pow|ers of the earth, repre&s;ented by the great red dragon. The church never before this, had <HI>prime occupancy,</HI> or fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any part of this terraqueous globe, in any great extent of territo|ry. In all countries and kingdoms wherever Chri&s;tianity had been planted, before its intro|duction into this American wilderne&s;s, the ruling powers in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the property, and right
<PB N="25" REF="015082_0023_0F95AAC1C700BD68">
of juri&s;diction and dominion, were in oppo&s;ition to this benevolent in&s;titution; and the church had to make her way through the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible dif|ficulties and dangers. While thus in an enemy's land, her per&s;ecutions and oppre&s;&s;ions, her bloody trials and &s;ufferings furni&s;h out the chief &s;ubject of her hi&s;tory from her beginning to the pre&s;ent day, in other parts of the world, from which &s;he is not wholly exempted in this. However, her degree of peace and quiet re&s;t has been greater than &s;he has ever known &s;ince &s;he has had exi&s;tance and being. When that God, to whom the earth be|longs, and the fulne&s;s thereof, brought his church into this wilderne&s;s, as on eagles wings, by his kind, protecting providence, he gave this good land to her, to be her own lot and inheritance for ever. He planted her as a plea&s;ant and choice vine; and drove out the Heathen before her. He has tenderly nouri&s;hed and cheri&s;hed her in her infant &s;tate, and protected and pre&s;erved her amid&s;t innumerable dangers. He has done won|ders in his providence for our fathers; and for us their &s;inful po&s;terity: They, and we have many a time, &s;tood &s;till, and &s;een the &s;alvation of the Lord. The woman, the church of Chri&s;t, has &s;uch a gift and grant from Heaven, of this part of God's world, for the quiet enjoyment of her liberties and privileges, civil and religious, that no power on earth can have any right to invade, much le&s;s to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s her of them. And every attempt of this kind to oppre&s;s and en&s;lave her; mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely unrighteous, and a gro&s;s viola|tion of ju&s;tice and truth. He that has all power in heaven and on earth, who will &s;oon de&s;troy
<PB N="26" REF="015082_0024_0F95AAC51C5109E8">
the man of &s;in, and all his confederate powers, by the &s;pirit of his mouth, and brightne&s;s of his coming, declares in this prophecy, that the "wo|man" &s;hall be nouri&s;hed and pre&s;erved in her place here de&s;cribed, "from the face of the &s;erpent." The &s;erpent &s;poken of, is the great dragon, called the Devil and Satan; the chief directing agent in all the dark plots of tyranny, per&s;ecution and op|pre&s;&s;ion; from who&s;e malignant rage, the church has a promi&s;e of future protection. This old &s;erpent &s;hall never be permitted to &s;hew his de|formed face, much le&s;s to lift up his mon&s;trous head, and frightful horns in this place here given to the woman for a &s;afe retreat and &s;ecure abode, "for a time, and times, and half a time;" which probably means, "to the end of the world," or till all the times and periods &s;poken of in this prophetic book are fulfilled and accompli&s;hed. I know that expo&s;itors take the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, "for a time, and times, and half a time," to include only the period of one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty days, mentioned ver&s;e 6, and &s;o under&s;tood the phra&s;e "for a time," to mean one propheti|cal year, and "times," to mean two years, and "half a time," an half year; in the whole, three years and a half: But it &s;eems more natural, and more agreeable to the phra&s;eology of &s;cripture, as well as the connection of the&s;e prophecies, in the events foretold, to interpret this pa&s;&s;age as &s;igni|fying all future time indefinitely. Or, if we apply it to di&s;tinct periods, the fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, "for a time," I &s;hould think, might, with great propri|ety, be taken for the time or period, that hath al|ready been mentioned. This con&s;truction appears natural, and not in the lea&s;t forced or &s;trained.
<PB N="27" REF="015082_0025_0F95AAC840FFA168">
Then the "times" will mean &s;uch times or periods as follow after the fulfilment of the above; and the "half time," mu&s;t &s;ignify the clo&s;ing period, when time is near run out, and ju&s;t come to an end. Taking the pa&s;&s;age in its proper connection, and plaine&s;t and mo&s;t obvious &s;en&s;e, we may well under&s;tand it as containing a prophetic promi&s;e to the church, of &s;afety and pre&s;ervation, during the period that had been de&s;cribed above, and thro' all &s;ucceeding times, even to the end of the world. Not but what the old dragon, with his black train of tyrannical per&s;ecuting powers, might greatly afflict and di&s;tre&s;s her: Yet, with all his cunning, art, policy and power, &s;hall never be able to e&s;tabli&s;h his en&s;laving doctrines, nor to erect his head and horns, to exerci&s;e his u&s;urped authority and uncontrouled dominion, as in papal Rome. We may expect, however, that he will be putting forth mo&s;t violent &s;truggles and efforts for this ba&s;e, malignant purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>ONE objection of weight, I have again&s;t the current opinion of expo&s;itors, who interpret the pa&s;&s;age, "a time, and times, and half a time," to &s;ignify the &s;ame period as the thou&s;and two hundred and three-&s;core days, is, that this is di&s;|honourable to the &s;acred writer, and &s;hews that he rather meant to puzzle and perplex his readers, than to enlighten and in&s;truct them. I believe that all will allow, that the language u&s;ed in the 6th ver&s;e, is more plain and intelligible, and has a more fixed and determinate meaning, than that in the 14th ver&s;e. Now, to &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame period of time, is de&s;cribed in the one, as in the other, is to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Apo&s;tle, after he
<PB N="28" REF="015082_0026_0F95AAC8A3167BA0">
had de&s;cribed a thing in a plain, ea&s;y way to be under&s;tood, proceeds on to involve the &s;ame &s;ub|ject in a cloud of my&s;tici&s;m, darkne&s;s and ob&s;cu|rity, which could not tend, very much, to the improvement and edification of Chri&s;t's church. It is u&s;ual with all good writers, as they advance on their &s;ubject, to elucidate and illu&s;trate their meaning more and more, to &s;et it in a plainer and more intelligible point of light. And this is, e&s;pecially, the tone of all in&s;pired writers, and of St. John in particular. The light of revela|tion is like the path of the ju&s;t, &s;hining brighter and brighter in every page, till we come to the clo&s;e of it.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould my explanation of this pa&s;&s;age, after all, be di&s;puted, and the time, times, and half time, allowed to include no more, altoge|ther, than the period of twelve hundred and &s;ixty years, which I have taken to be included in that expre&s;&s;ion only, "a time," yet it will not mate|rially affect my &s;cheme. For, on the old plan of expo&s;ition, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that after the expira|tion of the&s;e twelve hundred and &s;ixty years, the trials and &s;ufferings of the church will be chiefly over; and that a &s;cene of great peace, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s will open and commence. Hence, if the prophetic promi&s;e in the text, extends no further than to that happy and ble&s;&s;ed period, the church will &s;afely get through the long &s;torm and tempe&s;t, rai&s;ed by the dragon; and &s;o, be ready for a &s;hare in the ble&s;&s;ings of that glorious and happy period to &s;ucceed; during which, we need not be very anxious about her &s;afety, con&s;idering other precious promi&s;es that are made in her favour.</P>

THE &s;erpent is &s;aid, ver&s;e 15, "to ca&s;t out of his mouth, water, as a flood, after the woman, that he might cau&s;e her to be carried away of the flood." This, perhaps, is one of the artifices, &s;ays a learned expo&s;itor, which the&s;e enormous creatures make u&s;e of, "to beat down their prey," when flying from them. The common &s;ignifica|tion of a flood is an inundation of water, &amp;c. The P&s;almi&s;t &s;ets forth extreme dangers, under the notion of a flood. P&s;alm lxix. 15. "Let not the water-flood overflow me." And the violent a&s;|&s;aults, and &s;ubtle temptations, and &s;udden incur|&s;ions of the Devil and his in&s;truments again&s;t the church, are compared to a flood, I&s;aiah lix. 19. "When the enemy &s;hall come in like a flood, the &s;pirit of the Lord &s;hall lift up a &s;tandard a|gain&s;t him." Which prophecy may refer to, and have its accompli&s;hments in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the church, about which we are treating. The oppre&s;&s;ive and per&s;ecuting power here figuratively de&s;cribed, under the emblem of the &s;erpent, which occa&s;ioned the flight of the woman, the church, into this wilderne&s;s, whenever it has prevailed, has been full of the mo&s;t inveterate malice and envy again&s;t her; and u&s;ed every art and &s;trata|gem to extirpate and de&s;troy her from the earth. Hence, the flood which the &s;erpent ca&s;t out of his mouth after the woman, may very naturally and properly be interpreted to &s;ignify all the &s;ubtle temptations, artful &s;chemes, and machinations of our enemies and adver&s;aries, to en&s;nare and cor|rupt us, and to de&s;troy our liberties and privileges, that we might be embarra&s;&s;ed again under the old tyrant, the dragon, and patiently &s;ubmit to the iron yoke, and galling chains of cruel oppre&s;&s;ion

and bondage; which machinations and contriv|ances have been too many to be enumerated in a &s;hort, conci&s;e di&s;cour&s;e. Every one acquainted with the hi&s;tory of our country, of the New-Eng|land colonies in particular, mu&s;t know, that there have been floods i&s;&s;ued from the mouth of the old &s;erpent, after the woman, to effect her de&s;truction and overthrow. Whenever a &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m has run high, and a lu&s;ting ambition after arbitra|ry power and lawle&s;s dominion has prevailed; when the dragon dare venture to put on and wear his long horns; the woman in the wilderne&s;s has felt the grievous di&s;tre&s;&s;ing effects. At &s;uch &s;ea|&s;ons, je&s;uitical emi&s;&s;aries, the tools of tyrannical power, have been employed to corrupt her doc|trines, and lead her into the belief of the darling doctrines of arbitrary <HI>power, pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non|re&s;i&s;tance;</HI> who, like the frogs that i&s;&s;ued out of the mouth of the fal&s;e prophet, who are &s;aid to have the &s;pirit of devils, have been &s;lyly creeping into all the holes and corners of the land, and u&s;ing their enchanting art and bewitching policy, to lead a&s;ide, the &s;imple and unwary, from the truth, to prepare them for the &s;hackles of &s;lavery and bondage. Thou&s;ands and millions of money, have, at one time and another, been expended for the purpo&s;es of bribery and corruption, to accompli&s;h this malignant de&s;ign. Evil, wicked men have been entru&s;ted with the chief command in one province and another, where the door has been open, to act as tools of a corrupt admini|&s;tration and tyrannical power, in forwarding and ripening their deep-laid &s;chemes, for the de&s;truc|tion of the woman. The colonies in America will not &s;oon forget the cruel and tyrannical admi|ni&s;tration

of Sir Edmond Andro&s;s, at Bo&s;ton, and his evil de&s;igns again&s;t them in general; and Lord Cornbury, at New-York; the late in&s;idious and traiterous conduct of Bernard and Hutchin&s;on, is &s;till more fre&s;h in every one's mind; and like|wi&s;e of Gage, Carlton, and Dunmore, who, by their ba&s;e, perfidious and cruel behaviour, have rendered them&s;elves univer&s;ally odious and dete&s;t|able to the American colonies. In the&s;e and &s;uch like ways, not to mention the unrighteous &s;ta|tutes re&s;tricting and interdicting our trade and commerce, the &s;tamp-act, &amp;c. we have had floods poured forth from the mouth of the &s;er|pent, which at length, have brought on a civil war. The dragon finding his artful temptations on the one hand, and his cruel menaces and threatenings on the other, ineffectual to gain the woman to a compliance with his terms, has at length become wroth with her, and brought over his troops and armies to make war with the rem|nant of her &s;eed. But, ble&s;&s;ed be God! all his efforts and &s;truggles have hitherto been un&s;ucce&s;s|ful; for the earth helped the woman. Ver&s;e 16. "And the earth opened her mouth, and &s;wal|lowed up the flood which the dragon ca&s;t out of his mouth."</P>
<P>IF this is taken in the literal &s;en&s;e, to &s;ignify that gro&s;s terre&s;trial element which &s;u&s;tains and nouri&s;hes us, it is &s;trictly true; in which &s;en&s;e &s;ome of the prophecies have been, and yet will, no doubt, be accompli&s;hed. The earth has ever helped the woman &s;ince her arrival to the&s;e &s;hores, with every article nece&s;&s;ary to her comfortable &s;upport. She has never wanted for nouri&s;hing food, and good raiment; has never known the

di&s;tre&s;&s;es ari&s;ing from &s;carcity of bread, pinching hunger and famine; has always, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement and cultivation of the country, had things convenient for her, and, as I tru&s;t, been contented with her lot and condition. The earth has, in a very remarkable manner, thro' the ble&s;|&s;ing of Heaven, been profu&s;e and liberal in her precious fruits and productions, the year pa&s;t, when the dragon has been wroth with the woman, and u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible &s;chemes and contrivances to di&s;tre&s;s her, and &s;tarve her into a compliance to his de&s;potic and arbitrary rule, by &s;hutting up her ports and harbours, and interdicting her trade and commerce, and cutting her off from all &s;up|plies from her fi&s;hery, a very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary branch of her trade and livelihood, by which thou&s;ands were maintained. I &s;ay, when the wo|man has, in the&s;e, and in &s;uch like ways, been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, &s;he has been helped in a very extraor|dinary way, by the earth. Our crops of all kinds have been plentiful. Our fruit-trees loaded with fruit, and pre&s;&s;ed down with their burdens. Our granaries are full. There is &s;uch an uncommon plenty of all kinds of good provi&s;ions for man and bea&s;t, that &s;ome incon&s;iderate per&s;ons are rea|dy to e&s;teem it rather a cur&s;e, than a ble&s;&s;ing; as we know not how to di&s;pen&s;e with, or di&s;po&s;e of it. But not to enlarge here.</P>
<P>SHOULD we take the expre&s;&s;ion in a figurative &s;en&s;e, to mean the men of the earth, and earthly powers, it may &s;till, with truth and propriety be applied to our pre&s;ent ca&s;e. For as the oppre&s;|&s;ive mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by the Briti&s;h parliament, &s;trike at our temporal intere&s;t and property, as well as our civil and religious privileges, it will
<PB N="33" REF="015082_0031_0F95AACDC68C9AF0">
engage tho&s;e of an earthly temper to exert them|&s;elves in the pre&s;ent &s;truggles; by which means the earth helpeth the woman. And be&s;ides, the va&s;t advantage of the&s;e American plantations, in point of traffic and merchandi&s;e, to all &s;uch as trade in &s;hips, will doubtle&s;s, if the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;|tem is pur&s;ued, engage the kingdoms of the world, and the merchants of the earth, to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the colonies, to &s;uch purpo&s;es as will, in their operation, greatly help the woman again&s;t the flood ca&s;t out of the dragon's mouth.</P>
<P>AND not only the earth, but the God that made it, nouri&s;heth the woman in the wilderne&s;s, a|mid&s;t the mo&s;t violent and cruel attempts of a tyrannical and per&s;ecuting power, and has rai&s;ed up per&s;ons of a martial, heroic &s;pirit, and endow|ed them with &s;kill, courage and fortitude, to de|fend and protect his church. The flood of the dragon that has been poured forth to the north|ward, in the Quebec bill, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery, and other engines and in&s;truments that have been &s;et to work, to bring the &s;avages down upon us, to our utter de&s;truction, have been chiefly &s;wallowed up by our late &s;ucce&s;sful enter|prizes again&s;t them; and the woman has received a great addition of &s;trength from this quarter, as a door is opened for breaking up the &s;eat of the dragon in Canada; and for bringing in the Hea|then tribes, perhaps, the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles, into firm league and friend&s;hip with her, for her future defence and protection. So that in&s;tead of being carried away with this flood, &s;he &s;tands on more firm ground, and is better e&s;tabli&s;hed than ever. Should we extend the meaning of the phra&s;e, &s;o as to take in other neighbouring powers
<PB N="34" REF="015082_0032_0F95AACE97DAA4C8">
of the earth, they have likewi&s;e helped the wo|man in her di&s;tre&s;&s;es and troubles, by affording a competent &s;upply of military in&s;truments and war|like &s;tores for her defence and protection; when all po&s;&s;ible precaution had been u&s;ed by her ene|mies, to deprive her of the&s;e u&s;eful articles, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; and the&s;e other powers &s;eem &s;o friendly di&s;po&s;ed, that it is highly probable, &s;hould the &s;erpent continue to per&s;e|cute and di&s;tre&s;s the woman, that they will &s;oon open their mouth, and &s;wallow up the whole flood, even all the fleets and armies which the dragon may ca&s;t out of his mouth.</P>
<P>THE probability or conjecture of neighbour|ing nations continuing to help the woman, the church, to that degree, as to &s;wallow up all the floods, the &s;erpent may ca&s;t out of his mouth after her, is founded, not only on their pre&s;ent friendly appearance, and the part which their in|tere&s;ted views may lead them to take in the pre|&s;ent controver&s;y, but on the &s;ure word of prophe|cy. See Rev. xvii. 16, 17. "And the ten horns which thou &s;awe&s;t upon the bea&s;t, the&s;e &s;hall hate the whore; and &s;hall make her de&s;olate and naked; and &s;hall eat her fle&s;h, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will." The&s;e ten horns, doubtle&s;s mean &s;ome of the kingdoms and princes of the earth, that have, for a long time, been under the influence of the bea&s;t, the great whore of Babylon, and had a great &s;hare with her, in the cruel and bloody work of tyranny, per&s;ecution and oppre&s;&s;ion. But the time is coming, and perhaps near at hand, when their league and friend&s;hip with her, will be di&s;&s;olved and broken; and their love turned
<PB N="35" REF="015082_0033_0F95AACF346EC290">
into hatred and a &s;pirit of revenge. They will turn with warm zeal and violence again&s;t her; and u&s;e all their &s;trength and power for her de|&s;truction and overthrow. The&s;e &s;hall hate the whore to a degree beyond what they ever loved her, and &s;hall make her de&s;olate and naked. They &s;hall &s;trip her of all her co&s;tly ornaments which they have lavi&s;hed away upon her, and ef|fectually humble her in&s;olence and pride, and ex|po&s;e her to public &s;hame and di&s;grace; in the heat of their indignation and zeal, &s;hall eat her very fle&s;h, and burn her with fire. They will do the mo&s;t thorough execution upon this old harlot, by whom they had been &s;o long infatuated and de|ceived; and wholly break up the &s;tupid &s;chemes of idolatry, with all the monuments of it, and bring the abettors and in&s;truments of tyranny and per&s;ecution to their condign puni&s;hment. This God will put into their hearts, by a &s;trong and powerful impre&s;&s;ion, to fulfil his will; and they &s;hall agree in it, to perform his purpo&s;e and de|&s;ign. This prediction or prophecy, it is thought by judicious expo&s;itors, refers to the de&s;truction of papal Rome, or to the demoli&s;hing of the Popi&s;h hierarchy in general; and that the kings of France are pointed out, as the principal in|&s;truments to effect it. They have, in years pa&s;t, contributed greatly to her growth and advance|ment; and done much at the cruel work of per|&s;ecution. It is not impo&s;&s;ible, nor improbable, that the time is coming, when their hearts will be turned again&s;t her, and be improved by Heaven, as the principal authors of her overthrow and ruin. France has been &s;atiated with the blood of Prote&s;tants, and 'tis to be hoped, will never thir&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="015082_0034_0F95AAD2D0345C78">
after it any more. She has already &s;hewn &s;ome tendency towards a reformation; and therefore may be judged very likely to effect &s;uch a revolu|tion. It appears from ver&s;e 17, that the infatu|ation of Popi&s;h princes will be permitted by di|vine providence, only for a certain limited period, till the words of God be fulfilled. And then their minds &s;hall be turned and their eyes opened; and they &s;hall ruin and de&s;troy all oppre&s;&s;ive, ty|rannical combinations, more eagerly than they e&s;tabli&s;hed them. Should our honourable Conti|nental CONGRESS, &s;ee fit, in their great wi&s;dom, at this difficult juncture, to open a free trade, and corre&s;pond with that nation, in a way in which our threatened rights and liberties might have &s;uch &s;ecurity and indemnification, as to be in no hazard or danger of any future encroach|ment on them, the &s;pirit of liberty might &s;pread and circulate with commerce; and from &s;mall &s;parks, kindle up into a bright and inextingui&s;ha|ble flame, in that, and in other kingdoms of the earth; and &s;o ha&s;ten the fulfilment of this pro|phecy, in the entire de&s;truction of the bea&s;t, or man of &s;in, and in the complete and glorious &s;al|vation of God's afflicted church.</P>
<P>THE dragon, in this &s;ituation, is repre&s;ented as much embarra&s;&s;ed in his black &s;y&s;tem of politics, in a &s;tate of great perplexity, and high paroxi&s;m of pa&s;&s;ion. Ver&s;e 17. "He was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her &s;eed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." Which may refer to the pre&s;ent war that is carry|ing on with &s;uch heat and fury again&s;t us; which &s;eems chiefly levelled again&s;t tho&s;e who mo&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="015082_0035_0F95AAD46F2A7680">
&s;trictly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly adhere to the pure, uncorrupted doctrine and wor&s;hip of our pious forefathers; and have not been &s;educed nor per|verted from the right ways of the Lord, but &s;till keep God's commandments, and have the te&s;ti|mony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in his pure go&s;pel. A|mid&s;t all our declen&s;ions and back-&s;lidings, our divi&s;ions and here&s;ies, our contentions and &s;epa|rations, there remain yet in the land a godly rem|nant of the true &s;eed of the woman, who have not been enticed away to wor&s;hip the bea&s;t, nor prevailed upon to receive his mark; who have never apo&s;tati&s;ed nor departed from the faith and practice of the church, as fir&s;t planted in the wil|derne&s;s; but have continued &s;tedfa&s;t and immove|able amid&s;t all the &s;torms of temptation, and vi|olent a&s;&s;aults of the adver&s;ary. And the&s;e &s;eem the principal objects which excite the wrath and re&s;entment of the dragon, and again&s;t which, the whole artillery of his indignation and vengeance has been pointed and aimed. Who, tho' few in number, yet with &s;uch other helps and advantages as they are furni&s;hed with, will overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their te&s;timony. Their fidelity, courage and zeal is &s;uch, that &s;hould it come to a ca&s;e of extremity, they will not love their lives unto the death. But this part of the prophecy will admit of a different interpretation, and as well &s;uit the pre&s;ent times.</P>
<P>BY the "remnant of her &s;eed," we may under|&s;tand tho&s;e worthy, true members of the church, &s;taunch friends to liberty and the prote&s;tant reli|gion, who remained &s;till in the mother-country, and did not come over with her when &s;he took her flight into this wilderne&s;s. There has, ever &s;ince

the &s;ettlement of the&s;e colonies, been numbers of pious, godly per&s;ons, on the other &s;ide of the water, who have been friendly and well-di&s;po&s;ed towards us, and have u&s;ed all their power and in|fluence to promote our growth, our wealth and pro&s;perity. This remnant of the &s;eed of the wo|man, &s;ince our troubles have begun in America, have exerted them&s;elves to their utmo&s;t in our fa|vour, to divert the impending &s;torm of vengeance from lighting on us; have made mo&s;t moving and affecting &s;peeches in parliament, on the &s;ub|ject; have publi&s;hed many u&s;eful pieces in vindi|cation of the colonies; and have been, to the la&s;t degree, faithful in corre&s;ponding with their friends on this &s;ide of the Atlantic, to inform of the in|trigues and dark plots that were contriving again&s;t us. The&s;e things, together with the di&s;appoint|ment, &s;hame and di&s;grace that have attended the enterprizes of the dragon again&s;t us, have rou&s;ed his wrath again&s;t them likewi&s;e, which appears by a very &s;evere and extraordinary proclamation, publi&s;hed to forbid this corre&s;pondence between them and us, on the highe&s;t penalty. And from the commotions that began to be rai&s;ed among them therefor, &s;hould this civil war continue, it is highly probable, that within the term of another year, it may flame forth from the very bowels of the kingdom, where it &s;eems to be already kindling up, and where our brethren, which keep the com|mandments of God, will unavoidably be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. But in the i&s;&s;ue hereof, it is to be hoped, that the dragon will be wholly con&s;umed and de&s;troy|ed; that the &s;eat and foundation of all tyranny, per&s;ecution and oppre&s;&s;ion, may be for ever de|moli&s;hed; that the horns, whether civil or eccle|&s;ia&s;tical,

<P N="1">1. WE learn from what has been &s;aid, the true cau&s;e, as well as the deplorable effects of all di&s;|&s;entions and violent commotions amid&s;t the Chri&s;tian &s;tates and kingdoms of the world; which, like terrible earthquakes, to which they are compared, often &s;hake them from the centre, and convul&s;e them to death and ruin. If we trace them up to their time, &s;ource, and origin, we &s;hall pre&s;ently find, by the help of &s;cripture-light, they all proceed from the inveterate envy and malice which the dragon has again&s;t the wo|man, and the war and conte&s;t he is carrying on again&s;t her, and her &s;eed. This is plainly held forth in the&s;e prophecies of St. John, and is the grand &s;ubject of them. It has, from the begin|ning, been the con&s;tant aim and de&s;ign of the dragon, &s;ometimes called the bea&s;t, and the &s;er|pent, &s;atan, and the devil, to erect a &s;cheme of ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny on earth, and in|volve all mankind in &s;lavery and bondage; and &s;o prevent their having that liberty and freedom which the Son of God came from heaven to pro|cure for, and be&s;tow on them; that he might keep them in a &s;tate of &s;ervile &s;ubjection to him|&s;elf.

He has been, and &s;till is the chief coun|&s;ellor and directing agent in all the dark plots of oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution again&s;t God's church, to effect her de&s;truction; that his own wicked &s;cheme of tyranny might have a full e&s;tabli&s;hment on earth, and bear down all before it. And it is truly marvellous what &s;ucce&s;s he has been permit|ted to have in accompli&s;hing this malignant de&s;ign: How, not only men of lower abilities and le&s;s di&s;cernment have been deluded and infatuated by him; but many kings and chief rulers in church and &s;tate, of whom better things might have been expected. Such, after they have been made drunk with the intoxicating wine of his fornication and whoredom, have been his chief in&s;truments in this cruel and bloody work. They are of &s;uch dark complexion in their coun&s;els, and pur&s;uing &s;uch black de&s;igns, that they are repre&s;ented as "a&s;cending out of the bottomle&s;s pit, to make war again&s;t the faithful witne&s;&s;es and &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to kill them." And who can count up the numbers that have been &s;lain by them? Rivers of blood have been &s;hed, at one time and another, in this terrible war and conflict which the tyrannical, per&s;ecuting powers of the earth have been in&s;tigated by Satan, to carry on again&s;t the church of Chri&s;t. In the fir&s;t begin|ning of the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, ten per&s;ecutions followed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively one after another, while the government of Rome was in the hands of pagan emperors.</P>
<P>IN this &s;truggle between Pagani&s;m and Chri&s;ti|anity, thou&s;ands of martyrs and confe&s;&s;ors were mo&s;t cruelly and barbarou&s;ly tormented, and put to death. The&s;e horrid ma&s;&s;acres of the &s;aints

may be emblematically, or figuratively repre&s;ent|ed in the 6th chapter of this prophetic book, in the 9th ver&s;e of which, the apo&s;tle is &s;aid to have &s;een under the altar, the &s;ouls of them that were &s;lain for the word of God, and for the te&s;timony which they held. And after Rome became Chri&s;tian, or rather Papal, and the man of &s;in made his public appearance, the woman and her &s;eed, the humble followers of Chri&s;t, fared yet wor&s;e, and were more hardly and cruelly dealt with than ever, by their per&s;ecuting enemies, who are inwardly galled in their con&s;ciences, and &s;aid to be tormented at their pure doctrines, plain faithful remon&s;trances, and exemplary lives. See chap. xi. 10. When this great red dragon was mounted on high, with his &s;even heads and ten horns, the fir&s;t object on which he exerci&s;ed his tyrannical and per&s;ecuting power, was the church, repre&s;ented in the&s;e prophecies by the woman and her &s;eed. Hence, when &s;he appeared pregnant, ready to bring forth children, when the go&s;pel began to have &s;ucce&s;s, and new converts were born, and added to the church, this dragon &s;tood ready to &s;eize and devour them, like a hungry lion, eagerly waiting for his prey; and has per|&s;ecuted her with rage and fiercene&s;s, not only thro' the imperial populous cities of Italy and Bohe|mia, France, Spain, and England, and thro' their colonies and plantations, even to the uttermo&s;t ends of the earth. When &s;he took the wings of the great eagle, and, under the protecting provi|dence of God fled into the wilderne&s;s, he conti|nued wroth with her, and poured forth floods of his indignation and vengeance again&s;t her. "Wo to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the

&s;ea," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "for the devil is come down to them, having great wrath, becau&s;e he knoweth that he hath but a &s;hort time." This dragon, the great enemy of God, and of his church, whatever &s;hape or form he has a&s;&s;umed, whether that of the &s;potted leopard, with the feet of a bear, and the mouth of a lion; whether his horns have been ten, or only two, like a lamb or goat, giving life unto the image of the bea&s;t; yet he has in every appearance, when he had oppor|tunity, di&s;covered the like fiercene&s;s and cruelty of temper, thir&s;ting for the blood of the &s;aints. When his &s;hape and form has wore a milder a&s;pect, he has yet &s;poke as a dragon; and when times would allow of it, exerci&s;ed all the power of the fir&s;t bea&s;t, cau&s;ing the earth, and them that dwell therein, to wor&s;hip him; giving forth tyrannical mandates and decrees, that as many as would not wor&s;hip the image of the bea&s;t, &s;hould be killed: Gathering all into his &s;ervice, both &s;mall and great, rich and poor, free and bond, &s;laves and &s;avages, catholics and barbarians, to accompli&s;h at any rate, his black and dark de&s;igns; pa&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t vigorous acts, and &s;evere edicts again&s;t tho&s;e who refu&s;ed compliance; enacting by his omipotent power, that they &s;hould not buy nor &s;ell, nor carry on any trade or commerce by land or &s;ea. Now, the admini&s;tration &s;eems here de|&s;cribed, that has for a number of years, been &s;o grievous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the&s;e colonies in Ame|rica, claiming an ab&s;olute power and authority to make laws, binding in all ca&s;es whatever, without check or controul from any; which has proceeded in the exerci&s;e of this de&s;potic, arbitrary power, to deprive one of them, of their mo&s;t e&s;&s;entail

FROM what has been &s;aid, we &s;ee rea&s;on gratefully to acknowledge and adore the kind, watchful providence of God, in pre&s;erving his church, the woman and her &s;eed, amid&s;t the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, the commotions and convul&s;ions that have been occa&s;ioned by the oppre&s;&s;ive tyran|nical powers of the earth. The great dragon, her formidable enemy, notwith&s;tanding his mighty &s;trength and power, cruelty and rage, has always been overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their te&s;timony, in all her wars and conflicts with him; which, in&s;tead of an&s;wer|ing

his de&s;ign to cru&s;h and de&s;troy her, have ever been over-ruled by her all-wi&s;e benevolent king, to promote her growth and advancement in the world. The church, though often &s;urrounded by the flames of per&s;ecution, like the burning bu&s;h which Mo&s;es beheld as a type and emblem of it, yet has never been con&s;umed. The gates of death and hell have never prevailed again&s;t her. Chri&s;t has been with her from the beginning, agreeable to his divine promi&s;e; and will &s;o continue to the end of the world. The blood of the faints and martyrs that has been &s;hed, and flowed down like rivers and &s;eas, has been like &s;eed planted for the church, and made it &s;pread thro' a wider compa&s;s, and grow fa&s;ter in the world. All the combined policy of earth and hell has not been able to over|throw and demoli&s;h this building of God, who has e&s;tabli&s;hed it, and will pre&s;erve it by his al|mighty power, till all the purpo&s;es of his redeem|ing love and grace are accompli&s;hed in the com|plete &s;alvation of his cho&s;en ones. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the trials, afflictions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the church have been very great; but the&s;e have been as a purifying furnace, to clean&s;e her from dro&s;s and corruption, and to make her &s;hine brighter in all the graces and virtues of Chri&s;ti|anity. Her enemies and adver&s;aries, in all their furious attacks and malicious encounters, have never gained any con&s;iderable and la&s;ting advan|tage to them&s;elves; but generally have come off with lo&s;s, di&s;appointment and &s;hame; and had their own weapons, and the blows they have &s;truck, retorted back on them, with redoubled force and vengeance. God promi&s;es to give pow|er to his faithful witne&s;&s;es and &s;ervants, "And if
<PB N="45" REF="015082_0043_0F95AADC6B3A9AC8">
any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies. And if any man will hurt them, he mu&s;t in this man|ner be killed." Rev. ii. 3, 5. If the enemies of the church, in the wars they &s;et on foot, take any of her members captive, they them&s;elves &s;hall go into captivity; and he that killeth them with the &s;word, mu&s;t be killed with the &s;word: Agreeable to the great law of retaliation, which is wi&s;ely adopted at this day, by the honourable Continental CONGRESS; and the execution of it in full, is warranted and ju&s;tified by this, and and other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred writ. Tho&s;e that have undertaken to di&s;tre&s;s and per&s;ecute the wo|man and her &s;eed, the faithful &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, have ever found the interprize dangerous and ruin|ous to them&s;elves. When the wicked per&s;ecu|ting tyrants of the earth, appear to have great power and &s;trength, &s;ome of a &s;elfi&s;h and time|rous turn of mind, may inadvertantly think it &s;afe&s;t to pay wor&s;hip and allegiance to them, and receive their mark, and &s;eek &s;helter and pro|tection under their wings, from the impending &s;torm: But they are mo&s;t artfully deluded and mi&s;taken. "The &s;ame," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, Rev. xiv. 10. "&s;hall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation. And he &s;hall be tormented with fire and brim&s;tone, in the pre|&s;ence of the holy angels, and in the pre&s;ence of the Lamb; and the &s;moke of their torment a&s;cend|eth up for ever and ever, and they have no re&s;t day nor night."</P>
<P N="3">3. WE may, in a peculiar manner, notice the kind dealings of God in his providence towards
<PB N="46" REF="015082_0044_0F95AADE0EA42B40">
this branch of his church, that he has planted as a choice vine, in this once howling wilderne&s;s. He brought her as on eagles wings from the &s;eat of oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution, "to her own place," has, of his unmerited grace, be&s;towed liberties and privileges upon her, beyond what are enjoyed in any other part of the world: He has nouri&s;hed and protected her from the face of the &s;erpent, and pre&s;erved her from being carried away to de&s;truction, when great floods of his wrath and vengeance have been poured forth after her. God has, in this American quarter of the globe, provided for the woman and her &s;eed, a fixed and la&s;ting &s;ettlement and habitation, and be&s;towed it upon her, to be her own property for ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the church has &s;uch a gift and grant of this good land, from that God to whom the earth belongs, and the fulne&s;s thereof; the pre&s;ent war &s;et on foot by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try and parliament, again&s;t her true and worthy members, the American &s;ons of liberty, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them hereof, is not only felonious and murderous, as &s;tiled by the noble Lord Mayor of London, in his excellent &s;peech on this &s;ubject; but &s;eems likewi&s;e a very bold and daring attack upon the &s;overeign prerogative of that Being, who is the Great Lord Proprietor of all, to whom vengeance belongeth; who has already in|terpo&s;ed in a very &s;ignal manner, to di&s;play his awful vengeance again&s;t this wicked nefarious undertaking, by plunging four thou&s;and of the&s;e our malignant foes in the ocean, with an hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling of their property; by &s;etting fire to two of their &s;hips with lightening from hea|ven; and by a late very &s;weeping &s;torm on the coa&s;ts of Great-Britain, to an immen&s;e de&s;truction of both men and &s;hipping; by which, and other remarkable providences in our favour, we have inconte&s;tible evidence, that God Al|mighty, with all the powers of heaven, are on our &s;ide. Great numbers of angels, no doubt, are encamping round our coa&s;t, for our defence and protection. Michael &s;tands ready, with all the artillery of heaven, to encounter the dragon, and to vanqui&s;h this black ho&s;t.</NOTE>. In this ju&s;t view of the di&s;tingui&s;hed

favours of heaven toward our fathers, and us their &s;inful po&s;terity, while on the one hand, we &s;ee abundant cau&s;e for thank&s;giving and prai&s;e to our almighty pre&s;erver, and mo&s;t gracious bene|factor; we may on the other hand &s;ee the greate&s;t rea&s;on for the deepe&s;t humiliation, repentance, and contrition of heart, for our vile abu&s;e and mi&s;improvement of the&s;e privileges and favours. What an amazing low &s;en&s;e have we had, of the worth of the uncommon gifts and bounties of heaven? How awfully have they been &s;lighted and undervalued by us? What a&s;toni&s;hing &s;tupi|dity, ingratitude and unthankfulne&s;s has reigned in our hearts? How lukewarm and indifferent have we been, in the mo&s;t important concerns of reli|gion? How carele&s;s and unconcerned about the intere&s;t and welfare of the church of Chri&s;t? How backward to come into fellow&s;hip and commu|nion with her, and to attend the rites and ordi|nances which di&s;tingui&s;h (at lea&s;t outwardly) God's children from the profane wicked world? How does iniquity abound among us, and the love of many wax cold? How has the gold become dim, the mo&s;t fine gold changed? What awful back|&s;lidings and declen&s;ions in this land, once dedi|cated to the Lord as a mountain of holine&s;s, and an habitation of righteou&s;ne&s;s, liberty and peace? Surely the great head of the church, who knows our works, mu&s;t have not a few, but many things again&s;t us. We have, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t that lively faith, zeal and brotherly love, &s;o con|&s;picuous in the temper and conduct of our pious fore fathers, and added &s;uch a beauty and lu&s;tre to their characters. The true and noble &s;pirit of primitive chri&s;tianity is &s;carce to be found among

us; have lo&s;t our fir&s;t love, the love of our e&s;pou|&s;als, and kindne&s;s of our youth. Our churches decline in doctrine, wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline; and have had awful &s;chi&s;ms and rents made in them. A &s;pirit of contention, divi&s;ion and &s;eparation has prevailed to the great wounding of the church, and to the di&s;honour and &s;hame of all the pro|moters and abettors thereof. How have the Pro|phets, the faithful witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t, been de|&s;pi&s;ed and treated with contempt; while prophe|&s;ying in &s;ackcloth; and the woman, the true church, in her plain dre&s;s of go&s;pel purity and &s;implicity, been ridiculed, and thought to have no beauty or comeline&s;s in her? How eager have many been, in their attention to lying de|ceivers, the frogs that have i&s;&s;ued out of the mouth of the fal&s;e prophet; and charmed and captivated with their croaking noi&s;e, full of di&s;|cord and confu&s;ion? How has the beauty of this plea&s;ant land of Immanuel been defaced, and its glory &s;poiled by the little foxes treading down our tender vines; and by the inroads of the wild boar of the wilderne&s;s? The&s;e things are ju&s;tly mat|ter of deep and &s;erious lamentation, as they are doubtle&s;s the cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent calamities and judgments with which we are vi&s;ited.</P>
<P N="4">4. As there &s;till remains among us, a godly remnant that have not apo&s;tatized from God, nor departed from the faith of the go&s;pel; and as the&s;e prophecies on which we have been treating, will, many of them, mo&s;t probably have their fulfilment in this land; there are yet &s;olid grounds of hope and encouragement for us, in this dark and gloomy day. Tho' we may, in God's righte|ous providence, be &s;orely rebuked and cha&s;ti&s;ed
<PB N="49" REF="015082_0047_0F95AAE159FCE0B8">
for our woful apo&s;tacies, declen&s;ions and back|&s;lidings; yet we have, I think, good rea&s;on to believe, from the prophecies, &s;o far as we are a|ble to under&s;tand them, and from the general plan of God's providence, &s;o far as opened to view, in pa&s;t and pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ations of it, that we &s;hall not be wholly given up to de&s;olation and ruin. It is not likely nor probable, that God will revoke the grant he has made of this land to his church. His gifts as well as calling are without repentance. It does not appear probable, that a per&s;ecuting, oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical pow|er, will ever be permitted to rear up its head and horns in it, notwith&s;tanding its pre&s;ent violent a&s;&s;aults and &s;truggles. Liberty has been planted here; and the more it is attacked, the more it grows and flouri&s;hes. The time is coming and ha&s;tening on, when Babylon the great &s;hall fall to ri&s;e no more; when all wicked tyrants and op|pre&s;&s;ors &s;hall be de&s;troyed for ever. The&s;e violent attacks upon the woman in the wilderne&s;s, may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome of the la&s;t efforts, and dying &s;truggles of the man of &s;in. The&s;e commotions and convul&s;ions in the Briti&s;h empire, may be leading to the fulfilment of &s;uch prophecies as relate to his downfal and overthrow, and to the future glory and pro&s;perity of Chri&s;t's church. It will &s;oon be &s;aid and acknowledged, that the kingdoms of this world, are become the king|doms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t. The vials of God's wrath begin to be poured out on his enemies and adver&s;aries; and there is falling on them a noi&s;ome and grievous &s;ore. And to &s;uch as have &s;hed the blood of &s;aints and prophets, to them, blood will be given to drink; for they
<PB N="50" REF="015082_0048_0F95AAE1F539DAC0">
are worthy. And they will gnaw their tongues of fal&s;ehood and deceit, for pain; and have the cup of the wine of the fiercene&s;s of her wrath; and be rewarded double. The Lamb &s;hall over|come them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings; and they that are with him, are called, and cho&s;en, and faithful. May the Lord &s;horten the days of tribulation, and appear in his glory, to build up Zion; that his knowledge might co|ver the earth, as the waters do the &s;eas; that wars and tumults may cea&s;e thro' the world, and the wolf and the lamb lie down together, and nothing hurt or de&s;troy throughout his holy mountain.</P>

<P>IN the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, the apo&s;tle &s;aw in vi&s;ion, two bea&s;ts coming up; which, as far as I am acquainted, expo&s;itors have generally explained as a two-fold figurative repre|&s;entation of the &s;ame event. But to me it appears, that as the bea&s;ts were very diver&s;e, the one from the other; &s;o very different events were fi|gured out by them. It is &s;aid, ver&s;e 1. "And I &s;tood upon the &s;and of the &s;ea, and &s;aw a bea&s;t ri&s;e up out of the &s;ea" i. e. out of the church, "having &s;even heads, and ten horns," &amp;c. And in the 11th ver&s;e, it is &s;aid, "And I beheld another bea&s;t coming up out of the earth," i. e. of an earthly extract, &s;pringing up from ve|ry terrene, &s;en&s;ual motives, "and he had two horns like a lamb, and he &s;pake as a dragon." This fir&s;t bea&s;t here de&s;cribed, has been well explained by expo&s;itors, and applied to the <HI>man of &s;in,</HI> to the ri&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery. But this &s;econd bea&s;t, with equal ju&s;tice and propriety, may be con&s;idered as figurative of, and fulfilled in what is called, King HENRY's refor|mation. Every one that is acquainted with the
<PB N="52" REF="015082_0050_0F95AAE8AE56D2D0">
per&s;onal character of that prince, cannot but be &s;en&s;ible, that the motives by which he was influen|ced to &s;eparate from the church of Rome, were of a very terrene, &s;en&s;ual, earthly nature; fitly de&s;cribed by the bea&s;t's coming up out of the earth. "And he had two horns," civil and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical power, "like a lamb," with a more mild, benign and favourable a&s;pect on the church, than the fir&s;t bea&s;t. King Henry, when he broke with the Pope, a&s;&s;umed the chief and &s;upreme authority in the Briti&s;h church, as well as nation; here decyphered by the "two horns." And "he &s;pake as a dragon." Witne&s;s, the many hot and cruel per&s;ecutions that have been carried on in the kingdom, &s;ince the reformation, to the de|&s;truction of multitudes of the faithful &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Altho' Henry a&s;&s;umed head&s;hip in the church as well as &s;tate; yet it was a work of time to get him&s;elf acknowledged and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in that character; in the accompli&s;hment of which, he may be &s;aid, "To do great won|ders," &amp;c. Ver&s;e 13, 14. "Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they &s;hould make an image to the bea&s;t, which had the wound by a &s;word, and did live," i. e. the fir&s;t bea&s;t, the Pope.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul, prophe&s;ied of the man of &s;in, 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 4. and de&s;cribes him as one, "Who oppo&s;eth and exalteth him&s;elf above all that is called God, or is wor&s;hipped; &s;o that he as God &s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;hewing him&s;elf that he is God." Claiming to be the head of the church, and a&s;&s;uming &s;upreme, &s;overeign, ab&s;olute authority in it, is here pointed out as the grand, pecular, and di&s;tingui&s;hing mark and cha|racter
<PB N="53" REF="015082_0051_0F95AAE8DA0BFFD0">
of the man of &s;in; mo&s;t clearly and plainly fulfilled in the Pope. Con&s;equently, head&s;hip and &s;upremacy in the church, mu&s;t be the pecu|liar and di&s;tingui&s;hing features of this image of the fir&s;t bea&s;t, which the &s;econd bea&s;t required to be made. And what can be a more clear, plain and expre&s;s fulfilment of this prophecy, than that &s;upremacy in the church, given to our kings, ever &s;ince the reformation, by the Briti&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution? Where can we find any thing in all hi&s;tory, that bids &s;o fair for an accompli&s;hment of this emblematical prediction, in the ri&s;ing of the &s;econd bea&s;t? Nothing but a fond partiality, of applying every thing that is bad, to the Pope, can, I conceive, prevent our embracing this ap|plication of the prophecy.</P>
<P>"LET not tho&s;e who are friends to the epi&s;co|pal form of church government, look upon them|&s;elves pointed at, by any thing I have here &s;aid. For real epi&s;copacy does not imply an alliance be|tween church and &s;tate; nor nece&s;&s;arily require an earthly head to the church; much le&s;s to inve&s;t the king with that character, as every one mu&s;t acknowledge who will plead for epi&s;copacy as the primitive form of the church, &s;et up by the apo&s;|tles. Becau&s;e all the kings of the earth, in their day, and for many years after, were &s;o far from being e&s;teemed heads to the church, that they were not &s;o much as members in it."</P>
<P>THE time prefixed for the continuance of the fir&s;t bea&s;t, is "forty and two months." See ver&s;e 5. But the number of the &s;econd bea&s;t is menti|oned in the 18th ver&s;e. "Here is wi&s;dom. Let him that hath under&s;tanding count the number of the bea&s;t: For it is the number of a man, and
<PB N="54" REF="015082_0052_0F95AAEA925B10F0">
his number is &s;ix hundred three&s;core and &s;ix." Ex|po&s;itors have, many of them, &s;uppo&s;ed that this number intended the period from the time the apo&s;tle's receiving this vi&s;ion, to the ri&s;ing of the fir&s;t bea&s;t. But as this is the number of the &s;e|cond bea&s;t, if it be applied in &s;uch a manner, it mu&s;t be taken for that period between the ri&s;e of the fir&s;t, and of the &s;econd bea&s;t. But as the continuance of the fir&s;t bea&s;t was limited to forty two prophetic months, or a thou&s;and two hundred and &s;eventy &s;even years; &s;o this number &s;ix hun|dred &s;ixty &s;ix, may denote the duration of the &s;econd bea&s;t.</P>
