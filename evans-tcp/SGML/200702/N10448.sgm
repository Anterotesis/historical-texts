<P>Mr. CHAIRMAN,</P>
<P>I heartily thank this re&s;pectable A&s;&s;embly for the honour they have conferred upon me, but want words to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e I feel of their kindne&s;s.

I con&s;ider the approbation of this company as an evidence, that they entertain a favourable opini|on of my good intentions, and as an encouragement for all to apply them&s;elves, in the&s;e unhappy times, to the &s;ervice of the public, &s;ince even &s;mall endeavours to promote that &s;ervice, can find a very valuable reward. I will try, during the remainder of my life, to remember my duty to our common country, and, if it be po&s;&s;ible, to render my&s;elf worthy of the honour for which I now &s;tand &s;o deeply indebted.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the committee for pre|paring a draught of in&s;truc|tions was appointed, it was con&s;ider|ed, whether it would not be proper, to form &s;ome kind of a &s;ketch, however imperfect it might be, of all the grievances of the colonies, and of cour&s;e of their con&s;titutional rights.</P>
<P>SUCH an attempt, tho' very rude, might be improved by better hands; and it &s;eemed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, no longer to con&s;ine our&s;elves to occa|&s;ional complaints and partial reme|dies, but, if po&s;&s;ible, to attain &s;ome degree of certainty concerning our lives, liberties and properties.</P>
<P>IT was perceived, that if the in&s;truc|tions &s;hould be formed on this plan, they would comprehend many and ve|ry
<PB N="vi" REF="013247_0005_0F90435288F01DD0">
important po&s;itions, which it would be proper to introduce, by previou&s;ly a&s;&s;igning the rea&s;ons, on which they were founded. Otherwi&s;e, the po&s;i|tions might not appear to the com|mittee to be ju&s;t. From this con&s;i|deration it became nece&s;&s;ary, to ren|der the in&s;tructions long and argu|mentative; and whoever candidly reflects on the importance of the oc|ca&s;ion, will think &s;uch a method very ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>THE draught of in&s;tructions being brought into the provincial commit|tee and read, and no objection being made to any of the principles a&s;&s;erted in them, it was not thought nece&s;&s;ary, that the argumentative part &s;hould continue any longer in them. The committee, that brought in the draught, therefore moved, that this part of the in&s;tructions might be &s;e|parated from the re&s;t. Whereupon the draught was re committed, for this purpo&s;e, to the committee, that brought it in. This was done.</P>

SEVERAL additions have been made to the other part, now called "An E&s;&s;ay," &amp;c. &s;ince the vote for pub|li&s;hing. The additions are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by crotchets, thus [ ] and in the&s;e it was not thought nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the &s;tile of in&s;tructions.

<P>AGREED that, in ca&s;e of any difference in &s;entiment, the que&s;tion be determined by the deputies voting by counties.</P>
<P>THE letters from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> of the 13th of <HI>May</HI> were then read, and a &s;hort account given of the &s;teps taken in con&s;equence thereof, and the mea&s;ures now pur&s;uing in this and the neigh|bouring provinces; after which the following. RESOLVES were pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>UNAN. 1. THAT we acknowledge our&s;elves, and the inhabitants of this pro|vince, liege &s;ubjects of his maje&s;ty king <HI>George</HI> the third, to whom they and we ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and will bear true and faithful allegiance.</P>
<P>UNAN. II. That as the idea of an uncon|&s;titutional independence on the parent &s;tate is, utterly abhorrent to our principles, we view the unhappy differences between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and the Colonies with the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and anx|iety of mind, as fruitle&s;s to her, grievous to us, and de&s;tructive of the be&s;t intere&s;ts of both.</P>
<P>UNAN. III, That it is therefore our ardent de&s;ire, that our ancient harmony with the mo|ther
<PB N="4" REF="013247_0010_0F904356490D5A30">
ther country &s;hould be re&s;tored, and a perpe|tual love and union &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us, on the principles of the con&s;titution, and an inter|change of good offices, without the lea&s;t in|fraction of our mutual rights.</P>
<P>UNAN. IV. That the inhabitants of the&s;e colonies are entitled to the &s;ame rights and li|berties WITHIN the&s;e colonies, that the &s;ubjects born in <HI>England</HI> are entitled to WITHIN that realm.</P>
<P>UNAN. V. That the power a&s;&s;umed by the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to bind the people of the&s;e colonies, "by &s;tatutes IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER," is uncon&s;titutional; and there|fore the &s;ource of the&s;e unhappy differences.</P>
<P>UNAN. VI. That the act of parliament, for &s;hutting up the port of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> is uncon&s;ti|tutional; oppre&s;&s;ive to the inhabitants of that town; dangerous to the liberties of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> colonies; and therefore, that we con&s;ider our brethren at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> as &s;uffering in the common cau&s;e of the&s;e colonies.</P>
<P>UNAN. VII. That the bill for altering the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in certain criminal ca&s;es within the province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay,</HI> if pa&s;&s;ed into an act of parliament, will be as uncon&s;titutional, oppre&s;&s;ive and dangerous, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the act above-mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="013247_0011_0F90435708530310">
UNAN. VIII. That the bill for changing the con&s;titution of the province of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by charter, and enjoyed &s;ince the grant of that charter, if pa&s;&s;ed into an act of parliament, will be uncon&s;titutional and dan|gerous in its con&s;equences to the <HI>American</HI> co|lonies.</P>
<P>UNAN. IX. That there is an ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity, that a congre&s;s of deputies from the &s;everal colonies be immediately a&s;&s;embled, to con&s;ult together, and form a general plan of conduct to be ob&s;erved by all the colonies, for the purpo&s;es of procuring relief for our &s;uffer|ing brethren, obtaining redre&s;s of our griev|ances, preventing future di&s;&s;en&s;ions, firmly e&s;tabli&s;hing our right, and re&s;toring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">armony between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her colonies on a con&s;titutional foundation.</P>
<P>UNAN. X. That, although a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the commerce of this large tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing province, with <HI>Great Britain,</HI> would greatly di&s;tre&s;s mul|titudes of our indu&s;trious inhabitants, yet that &s;acrifice and a much greater we are ready to offer for the pre&s;ervation of our liberties; but, in tenderne&s;s to the people of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as well as of this country, and in hopes that our ju&s;t remon&s;trances will&punc; at length, reach the

<P N="11"> XI.

<P N="12">XII.

<P>UNAN. XIII. That the venders of mer|chandize of every kind; within this province,
<PB N="7" REF="013247_0013_0F90435879AB1B78">
ought not to take advantage of the re&s;olves relating to non-importation in this province or el&s;e where; but that they ought to &s;ell their merchandize, which they now have, or may hereafter import, at the &s;ame rates they have been accu&s;tomed to do within three months la&s;t pa&s;t.</P>
<P>UNAN. XIV. That the people of this pro|vince will break off all trade, commerce, and dealing, and will have no trade, commerce, or dealing of any kind with any colony on this continent, or with any city or town in &s;uch colony, or with any individual in any &s;uch co|lony, city, or town, which &s;hall refu&s;e, de|cline, or neglect to adopt, and carry into exe|cution &s;uch general plan as &s;hall be agreed to in congre&s;s.</P>

<P>When once their &s;upernumeraries are become manu|facturers, it will require more than <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> policy to con|vert them into planters.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t think this point of &s;uch great importance, as to extend probably to the <HI>annihilation of manufacturers</HI> in our colonies&mdash;To conclude, it is in the propo&s;ed &s;ettle|ment on the <HI>Ohio</HI> we mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t</HI> look for hemp and flax; as &s;uch great numbers of the old <HI>American</HI> farmers have re|moved and &s;ettled there, which may, in tho&s;e fertile tracts, be cultivated in &s;uch abundance, as to enable us to under&s;ell all the world, as well as &s;upply our own con&s;umption. It is on tho&s;e high, dry, and healthy lands, that vineyards will be cultivated to the be&s;t advantage, as many of tho&s;e hills contain quarries of &s;tone, &dagger; and not in the unhealthy &s;ea-co&s;ts of our <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> colonies.

<P>What I &s;hall therefore venture to propo&s;e is, that the government, <HI>through the means of a few merchants</HI> acquaint|ed with the <HI>American</HI> trade, that can be tolerably de|pended upon, &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>factons</HI> at <HI>Bo&s;ton, Philadelphia, New York,</HI> and a few other ports, for the &s;ale of &s;uch car|goes of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manufactures as &s;hould be con&s;igned to them; and to con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch particularly as were mo&s;t manufactured in the province, with directions immediately and continual|ly to <HI>under&s;ell</HI> all &s;uch colony manufactures.

<P>But I laid it down as a rule to proceed upon, that <HI>trade, fi&s;hing,</HI> and <HI>manufacturing,</HI> were put an entire &s;top to among the colonies.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t dependance of our colonies, as well as all their people, is, to change the terms a little, upon corn worked into bread and iron wrought into implements; or, in other words, it is upon <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> agriculture and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> manufactures; for a people who do not po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e, to think of throwing off the yoke of another <HI>who &s;upplies them with them,</HI> is an ab&s;urd idea.

<P>Whatever pretence the chief ju&s;tice's opinion was founded on, it has been carefully repeated in many law books &s;ince.
