<HEAD>The LIFE of RICHARD BARRICK.</HEAD>
<P>I RIHCARD BARRICK, was born in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the month of February, in the year 1763, and brought up at the Foundling-Ho&s;pital: I never could read nor write. At ten years of age I went as an Apprentice to James Saunders, a Silk-weaver in <HI>Spittlefield</HI> Pari&s;h, lived with my ma&s;ter about three years, but he &s;tarved and froze me almo&s;t to death, for which I left him, and roved through the &s;treets, and frequently &s;tole &s;mall things from &s;hop-win|dows.</P>
<P>I went to <HI>Salt-petre Bank,</HI> and joined a gang of thieves. We &s;tole from many people for the &s;pace of a year; when I was taken up for &s;tealing a handkerchief, and carried before the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who &s;ent me to Gaol; I was tried and found not <HI>innocent;</HI> was complimented with thirteen &s;tripes, which is continental colours, &s;ignifying, that I &s;hould be honoured in <HI>America</HI> with the <HI>Hibernian</HI> coat of arms, that is, two &s;ticks <HI>rampant,</HI> one <HI>couch|ant,</HI> a &s;tring <HI>pendant,</HI> and an <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> at the end of it.</P>
<P>I joined my old gang again, and continued picking pockets for a year, and then was taken up and com|mitted to Gaol, and lay there eleven weeks for trial; then I was tried and found guilty. They told
<PB N="4" REF="018559_0003_0FA7B076254C2FF0">
me they would pardon me if I would enter on board one of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips; this I con&s;ent|ed to, but made my e&s;cape before I got to the &s;hip. I returned back to <HI>Salt-petre Bank,</HI> where I joined my old companions in iniquity; went on picking pockets for &s;ix months, and was apprehend|ed on &s;u&s;picion of Robbery, and was &s;ent on board a ve&s;&s;el, in which I came to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>Then I de&s;erted and went to <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and lived with Mr. Volentine Williams; I left him and lived with Mr. Kirk fifteen months, intending to learn the Paper-making bu&s;ine&s;s. During this time, I was as hone&s;t as the times would allow. I left Mr. Kirk, and went to <HI>Hor&s;e-Neck,</HI> intending to go to the place from whence I came, and follow my old trade of <HI>Ba&s;ket Making.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after this I and my comrades went to <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> with an intent to rob James Ulits; but the weather being very &s;evere, we turned back. On our return we met with a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el which we boarded and carried her into <HI>Stanford.</HI> We then went back to Mr. Ulits, in the night, and told him he mu&s;t get up, for his brother's child was very &s;ick.&mdash;He &s;uppo&s;ing us to be robbers, called for his firelock: We then forced in at the windows, and demanded his money. He &s;aid he had none; but his wife a&s;ked us how much we wanted? I an&s;wered one hundred pounds, Mr. Ulit went down cellar with a light in his hand, and we followed him; he took a horn from under a hog&s;head, which contain|ed one hundred and ninety odd guineas. He then attempted to count out our hundred pounds which we demanded; but we told him as he made &s;ome
<PB N="5" REF="018559_0004_0FA7B076C3B2C318">
re&s;i&s;tance at fir&s;t, we would take all he had. He then gave us another horn, which contained about forty guineas: Then he gave us a number of dollars. We went out of the hou&s;e, but &s;oon concluded that if he had &s;o many guineas, it was more than proba|ble he had &s;ome other &s;ort of gold; therefore we went back and demanded the remainder.&mdash;Then he gave us another horn containing thirty two half-Joes. we al&s;o took his plate and clothing, to the Value of four hundred dollars.</P>
<P>Soon after this, I was taken and put under guard on <HI>Long-I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>The Colonel ordered me from <HI>Long-I&s;land</HI> to <HI>New-York</HI> goal for trial; where I remained three weeks, and then broke goal.</P>
<P>I returned to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and was there re-taken for the &s;ame crime, and carried back to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>I broke out the &s;econd time and returned to <HI>Green|wich.</HI></P>
<P>Then I went to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and there I was taken up and committed to goal for <HI>Burglary,</HI> and tried for my life; but was acquitted. I was taken back to goal and had another trial and found guilty of theft. Then I was &s;ent back to the work-hou&s;e, to pick oakum for a month and pay fifteen pounds fine. (It may be noted here, that I had been confined in the dungeon in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> &s;ix weeks before.) I tarried in the work-hou&s;e one fortnight, and then run away and came to <HI>New-York,</HI> there I &s;tole a dozen &s;ilver &s;poons, out of a gold&s;miths ca&s;e. Then went to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and broke open a &s;hop, and &s;tole goods to the amount of one hundred dollars: And from thence to <HI>New-London,</HI> and met with one of my old friends; he and I broke open a hou&s;e and &s;tole &s;ome clothing. Then went to <HI>Providence,</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="018559_0005_0FA7B077785BDF28">
there I &s;tole a watch out of a man's pocket, but was taken; I gave the man five dollars and his watch, and he &s;aid no more about it. I then went to <HI>Bo&s;|ton,</HI> and got in company with one Poor; and one John Sullivan (the latter is now under &s;entence of death with me) we went to <HI>Winter's-Hill,</HI> and there robbed one Mr. Baldwin, for which crime Sullivan and my&s;elf are to &s;uffer Death, as being the ju&s;t re|ward of our demerits.</P>

<HEAD>The LIFE of ALEXANDER WHITE, a PIRATE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is to give &s;atisfaction to all enquiring friends, that I ALEXANDER WHITE, was born in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> in the County of <HI>Tryone,</HI> in the year of our Lord one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-two, and was brought up in the &s;aid place, and got what education my parents thought nece&s;&s;ary. After I grew up my mind being inclined to vi&s;it &s;trange Countries again&s;t my parent's will. I took my departure from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and went to <HI>England,</HI> and bound my&s;elf ap|prentice to learn the Mariners art, and &s;erved my Ma&s;ter faithfully, until it plea&s;ed him to give up my indentures.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="018559_0006_0FA7B078401CDAB8">
I &s;till followed the occupation of a Mariner, and improved my education until I thought fit to take the command of a ve&s;&s;el. I have been through ma|ny &s;cenes of life, and always endeavoured to &s;upport the character of an hone&s;t man, and believe that I was harmle&s;s to any body but my&s;elf. It is need|le&s;s for me to give an account how I &s;pent my life; for I have been in many parts of the world, but never did any thing that would cau&s;e me to blu&s;h, or be a&s;hamed, before I tran&s;acted this horrid crime that I am to &s;uffer for.</P>
<P>If you de&s;ire to know what this temptation did ari&s;e from; with &s;hame I will endeavour to in|form you: At fir&s;t when I met with Capt. White it was in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> My money being almo&s;t &s;pent, I agreed to go to <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> with him. Accordingly we pur&s;ued our intended voyage as far as <HI>New-York,</HI> and there we took on board our cargo, and came to a place called <HI>Cow-Harber,</HI> in <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and there tarried &s;ome days, and took on board the pa&s;&s;enger John Vail, and &s;ailed quick|ly from thence.</P>
<P>My mind being very unea&s;y on account of a young lady whom I propo&s;ed to marry, only the want of money prevented our being joined in the bands of Hymen. Being below her degree, and being a&s;hamed to own my nece&s;&s;ity, prolonged our being joined in wedlock. But love began to burn my poor and wounded heart; and being re&s;olved to go through any difficulty that might impede us, I in|tended to take the life of my fellow creature; one evening &s;eeing a good opportunity, I took up an axe, and with it I &s;truck Captain White overboard, and attempted to murder the pa&s;&s;enger al&s;o; but
<PB N="8" REF="018559_0007_0FA7B07A65FA2B00">
when I found I could not accompli&s;h my purpo&s;e &s;urrendered my&s;elf a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>I was confined for &s;ome time. Towards morn|ing we fell in with a ve&s;&s;el, which carried me into <HI>Plymouth</HI> as a pri&s;oner, and remained for a con|&s;iderable time, which I &s;pent in angui&s;h, imploring mercy of God, for the crime I had committed. I was then &s;ent to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and condemned to die by my own confe&s;&s;ion: And, agreeable to my inclination (choo&s;ing rather to die than live.) Time would fail me to give a particular account of this affair; but this is the truth that I have &s;et forth, which I declare as a dying man.</P>

<P>I JOHN SULLIVAN, was born in <HI>Ireland</HI> in the town of <HI>Limrick;</HI> was eighteen years old la&s;t April.</P>
<P>I inli&s;ted as a &s;older in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice in the year 1777, and took 5 pounds bounty; the Captain's name was Thomas, in the 36th regiment. Went to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> in order to join the army but de&s;erted.</P>
<P>I then went to <HI>Wales</HI> with an intent to inli&s;t the &s;econd time, but altered my mind, and entered on
<PB N="9" REF="018559_0008_0FA7B07A8DD81140">
board the <HI>Ceres</HI> frigate, in the king's &s;ervice, bound to <HI>New-York:</HI> I &s;taid on board near three weeks, and then de&s;erted. I went to <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and there was pre&s;&s;ed on board a Ve&s;&s;el, &s;taid on board eleven weeks, and then de&s;erted.</P>
<P>I entered on board a &s;loop bound to <HI>New-York&punc;</HI> but hauled in at <HI>Loyd's-Neck:</HI> When I landed I was di&s;covered and pur&s;ued, by the Doctor of my former ve&s;&s;el; he was on hor&s;e-back, and drove me into the water, but I was oblidged to come on &s;hore and &s;urrender; I then received thirty-nine la&s;hes.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night I de&s;erted and &s;wam to another ve&s;&s;el, commanded by one Kelley: the ma&s;ter and I combined together, and &s;tole the ve&s;&s;el, carried her into <HI>Stonington</HI> and &s;old her: I received about three hundred dollars for my &s;hare.</P>
<P>From <HI>Stonington</HI> I went to <HI>New-London,</HI> and entered on board a privateer John Buckley com|mander: I tarried on board three months; we took &s;ome prizes. I then entered on board another privateer, commanded by James Woodworth; after a month's crui&s;e was taken by the Briti&s;h, and carried into <HI>New-York,</HI> and put on board the Guard-&s;hip, where I remained three days, and then was put on board the <HI>Le&s;ophe,</HI> where I remained eleven weeks: She came to <HI>Staten-I&s;land,</HI> where I de&s;ert|ed.

In Augu&s;t one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty two I happened to fall in company with a lad; he and I laid down to re&s;t. After he got to &s;leep I &s;earched his pockets, and &s;tole one guinea and a crown. After this I entered on board a whale-boat with the per&s;on I &s;tole from, we went a cruize and came into <HI>Stonington,</HI> where I was accu&s;ed of &s;tealing the guinea and crown, but denied it: They &s;earched me and found the money tied up in the tail of my &s;hirt; they cut off my &s;hirt-tail and left me. I went to Col. Daverport and he gave me a pa&s;s to <HI>New-London.</HI> I there entered on board a pri|vateer commanded by I&s;aac Warner. We went about eight days crui&s;e, and by di&s;tre&s;s of weather got di&s;ma&s;ted: Our ve&s;&s;el being a wreck, and enable to defend our&s;elves, we were taken by a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el and carried to <HI>Burmudas.</HI> I then engaged with the Captain who took me pri&s;oner, to go to &s;ea with him. I took twenty dollars bounty. I never went on board after I received the money and clothes, but rode off on my ten toes and left them.</P>
<P>I went about &s;even miles to a piece called <HI>Cole-Lane,</HI> and engaged to go on board a pri|vateer, took twenty-four dollars from the Cap|tain and then bid them good night. I next went to <HI>St. George's;</HI> there I entered on board another privateer, Captain Hall commander, and took twen|ty-four dollars bounty, we went five weeks crui&s;e and then returned to <HI>Burmudas.</HI> Being de&s;titute of every thing, I endeavoured to help my&s;elf to that which Solomon &s;ays will an&s;wer all things; and knowing that one Gutherege kept a &s;tore there, I

took a partner with me and broke it open, where we found a barrel of dollars; we took our pockets and hats full, then went to a place called Salt Ket|tles, and changed the &s;ilver for gold.</P>
<P>Three weeks after this I entered on board Captpunc; Vezey, bound to <HI>St. Thomas's:</HI>&mdash;Peace being pro|claimed, I went to <HI>North Carloina.</HI> I went from thence to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> where I went to work three weeks: then I and my partner broke open a &s;tore in the day time, and took out twenty-four half-joes and &s;ome &s;ilver; my comrade was taken up on &s;u&s;|picion and carried before a Ju&s;tice, but made his e&s;cape; and as I was not &s;u&s;pected, was &s;ent to catch him; I followed on until I overtook him, and he and I contrived the matter between us, that he gave me his &s;hoes and buckels to carry and tell the injured people that I pur&s;ued him &s;o clo&s;e that he was obliged to drop his &s;hoes and buckels, and for this piece of villainy they rewarded (what they fal&s;ely called) my fidelity with two dollars.</P>
<P>I then went to <HI>Baltimore</HI> and entered my&s;elf on board a pilot boat, a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> went to <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> I then entered my&s;elf on board a tran&s;port bound to <HI>Scot|land.</HI> I &s;u&s;pected there was money on board, nor was my &s;u&s;picion groundle&s;s, for I and one more found a che&s;t, and breaking it open, took out 40 pounds, then made our e&s;cape to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after this I got a new comrade, and we broke open a &s;hop, and took out the value of 100 pounds in money and watches. I then went to <HI>Newbury-Port,</HI> where I entered on board Capt Wheelwright, bound to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> When I arrived there, I went into a trader's &s;hop and took to the value of 40 pounds in goods. Soon after this
<PB N="12" REF="018559_0011_0FA7B08A9340D928">
I took another comrade, and walking out we met: a man in the road: We told him we wanted &s;ome money and &s;ome we would have; he gave us three crowns. I then returned to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>On Friday night before Commencement, Barrick and I went to <HI>Roxbury</HI> with an intent to rob any per&s;on, but we were di&s;appointed. The next Mon|day night we went upon the old errand, but no booty. Soon after this we went to <HI>Winter's-Hill,</HI> and there we fell in with one Mr. Baldwin, and robbed him of his watch and money. I took the watch out of Mr. Baldwin's pocket, but Poor (the fellow who turned States Evidence) was the man that abu&s;ed and gave him heavy blows. For this la&s;t crime I am to &s;uffer death.&mdash;The&s;e are the mo&s;t capital crimes I have committed, and I &s;incerely wi&s;h that others may a|void the rocks on which I have &s;plit.</P>
