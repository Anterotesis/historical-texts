<P>SOLEMN and deeply affecting to the feeling mind is the pre&s;ent &s;cene!&mdash;We here behold a truly pitiable object, one of our guilty race, who, left to the guidance of an unin&s;tructed mind; or rather to the uncontrouled in|fluence of the direful pa&s;&s;ions, malice and revenge, has per|petrated a crime which freezes the mind with horror.&mdash; She has been &s;ummoned before the Civil Tribunal; and, after a fair and impartial trial, was convicted of the crime for which &s;he is this day to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>The cry of innocent blood hath <HI>entered into the ears of the</HI> LORD <HI>of Sabaoth</HI>; but this day will &s;ilence its claims. &mdash; YES; in a few hours, will be executed the fatal, the tremen|dous &s;entence which puts a period to the life of one, who had never learned to live.&mdash;In the beginning of life, a <HI>murderer,</HI> Ju&s;tice forbids that &s;he &s;hould live out half her days: for&mdash;

<HI>Who&s;e &s;heddeth Man's blood, by Man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 9.6.</NOTE> This is the voice of Ju&s;tice and of the GOD of Ju&s;tice: There|fore "<HI>a man that doth violence to the blood of any per&s;on, &s;hall flee to the pit&mdash;let no man &s;tay him.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 28.17.</NOTE></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on is all-important:&mdash;How &s;hall I an&s;wer its claims?&mdash;On the one hand, the poor pri&s;oner loudly claims every moment as her own: for that her la&s;t &s;ands are now falling, and that in a few hours &s;he mu&s;t launch into that world whence there is no return.&mdash;On the other hand, are the intere&s;ts of this numerous a&s;&s;embly of fellow-men, who are al&s;o &s;oon, very &s;oon to clo&s;e this mortal life; and the eternal &s;tate of each be determined according to his pre&s;ent improvement of divine in&s;truction.&mdash;And, how big with important in|&s;truction is the melancholy event, of which we are this day to be witne&s;&s;es!&mdash;Principally then to my Auditory let the pre&s;ent opportunity be devoted.</P>
<P>To this I the more readily con&s;ent, from a conviction of the impracticability of adapting a Di&s;cour&s;e, upon this occa&s;ion&punc; to the improvement of one who, until within a few weeks, was ignorant of the fir&s;t principles of Religion; having been left to heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s in a Chri&s;tian land. Yes; my brethren, this poor pri&s;oner, when committed to gaol, ap|peared to have no higher principle than the plea&s;ure of gratifying her ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;And &s;o far from having the fear of GOD before her eyes&mdash;<HI>O tell it not in Gath!</HI> &mdash;&s;he hath repeatedly declared to me, that &s;he did not know that there was a GOD, before &s;he was told it after her impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Are there any in this a&s;&s;embly who&s;e con&s;ciences reproach them with the &s;ame cruel inattention to <HI>their</HI> Children and Servants? Such are this day called to their duty in language which mu&s;t pierce a Parent's heart. May every &s;pectator of this day's painful &s;cene, learn the importance of faithfulne&s;s in the relations of Parent and Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019547_0005_0FABF95B36D5AC88">The melancholy event, which we are now called to con|template, &s;peaks to us in thunder from the Mercy-Seat.&mdash; Though wrath is kindled again&s;t us; yet HEAVEN addre&s;&s;es us as he did his cho&s;en people: <HI>Be thou in&s;tructed, O Jeru&s;a|lem, le&s;t my &s;oul depart from thee.</HI></P>
<P>I may not enlarge in &s;hewing the occa&s;ion of this pa&s;&s;age: &mdash;<HI>For this I &s;ay, brethren, the time is &s;hort.&mdash;What thou doe&s;t, do quickly.</HI>&mdash;In a word therefore: this pa&s;&s;age was delivered by the Prophet in the name of the LORD, at a time when Judah had almo&s;t filled up the mea|&s;ure of her iniquities, and exhau&s;ted the patience of her GOD. In the ver&s;e preceding our text we have her charac|ter. <HI>As a fountain ca&s;teth out her waters, &s;o &s;he ca&s;teth out her wickedne&s;s: violence and &s;poil is heard in her, before me continually is grief and wounds.</HI> Then follows our text: in which we behold the mercy and compa&s;&s;ion of her GOD. Though he had <HI>&s;ent unto them all his &s;ervants the Prophets, &s;aying, Obey my voice and I will be your GOD, and ye &s;hall be my people.

<P N="2">II. Con&s;ider the argument by which attention to this in|&s;truction is here enforced.&mdash;<HI>Le&s;t my &s;oul depart from thee.</HI></P>
<P>FIRST. We are to attend particularly to the in&s;truction which GOD, in righteous judgment, is <HI>this day</HI> calling us to receive.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="019547_0006_0FABF95BB40E7E08">Various are the ways in which the MOST HIGH in&s;tructs his people.&mdash;His works lie as an open volume to be read by all. <HI>The invi&s;ible things of GOD from the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made,</HI> even <HI>his eternal power and Godhead.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. 1.20.</NOTE>&mdash;His Word &s;peaks in plainer language; and <HI>is profitable to direct,</HI> to make <HI>the man of GOD perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 3.17.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the&s;e means of in&s;truction, without the &s;pecial influen|ces of divine grace, are of no avail:&mdash;For, the heart of the children of men being <HI>fully &s;et in them to do evil&punc; they hear|ken not, nor incline their ear. We have loved</HI> plea&s;ures, <HI>and after them will we go.</HI></P>
<P>But, when GOD &s;peaks in the thunders of <HI>Judgment; the people,</HI> if not left to a judicial blindne&s;s and hardne&s;s of heart, <HI>hear and fear and do no more &s;uch wickedne&s;s.

The Sen&s;es are an avenue by which there is an ea&s;y acce&s;s to the heart. When this is brought to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of virtue, the under&s;tanding is ea&s;ily convinced.</P>
<P>The melancholy event, of which we are this day to be witne&s;&s;es, con&s;idered with all its attendant circum&s;tances, addre&s;&s;es every tender feeling, and cannot fail to reach the heart.&mdash;Struck with horror at the bloody deed&mdash;Amazed at &s;uch an in&s;tance of <HI>cruelty</HI> and <HI>revenge</HI> in one &s;o young.&mdash; And every tender emotion of the &s;oul awakened at beholding this early victim &s;acrificed to Ju&s;tice:&mdash;Will not every one pre&s;ent, with earne&s;tne&s;s enquire&mdash;Wherefore has our land been thus &s;tained with a crime, which, with all its painful circum&s;tances, it has never known before? Wherefore are we called to this &s;cene of woe?&mdash;<HI>What doth the LORD require of us?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="019547_0007_0FABF95CAFB43050">I an&s;wer, <HI>in the name of the LORD,</HI> that ye re&s;olve with his Servant of old&mdash;<HI>I will behave my&s;elf wi&s;ely in a perfect way: I will walk</HI> WITHIN MY HOUSE <HI>with a perfect heart.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 101.2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Shameful and unpardonable, my brethren, is the almo&s;t univer&s;al neglect of family In&s;truction and Government. One of the truly unhappy con&s;equences of this neglect, we behold in the ignominious end of this poor girl who is now to pay the forfeit of life into the hands of ju&s;tice. <HI>Be thou in&s;tructed, O Jeru&s;alem, le&s;t my &s;oul depart from thee.</HI></P>
<P>When I reflect on the nature of the duties in which GOD is now in&s;tructing us, to which therefore we are now to at|tend; I could wi&s;h that the &s;peaker had been &s;uch an one as "Paul the <HI>Aged,</HI>" rather than the Youth whom the reque&s;t of the pri&s;oner has called to addre&s;s you upon this occa|&s;ion. But &s;ince this may not be, permit me, with that re&s;pect which is due to my auditory, in the warmth of love to my Country and the Souls of men, and with that fidelity which I owe to our great Ma&s;ter and LORD, to point out &s;ome of tho&s;e duties; to the di&s;charge of which you are obli|gated as <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI>; and to the neglect of which the melancholy &s;cene of this day is in a great mea&s;ure to be charged.</P>
<P N="1">I. Family Devotion, though a very unfa&s;hionable, is, however, a very important part of the duty of the Head of a family, if he would <HI>walk in his hou&s;e with a perfect heart.</HI> &mdash;"Every hou&s;e &s;hould be a Bethel, and every ma&s;ter of a family, in his hou&s;e, a prie&s;t of the MOST HIGH GOD." A daily <HI>reverential</HI> attendance upon this duty, early impre&s;&s;es the young mind with a &s;en&s;e of the divine omnipre&s;ence, and teacheth the fear of that GOD who&s;e <HI>eyes are in every place.</HI> Shall the heathen, my brethren, guided by the dim light of Nature, bow down at their family altars; and &s;hall the fa|milies, in which the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hines with the clear light of divine Revelation, pay no wor&s;hip to the true
<PB N="10" REF="019547_0008_0FABF96E2C2C6D08">
GOD?&mdash;Are there no family wants to be &s;upplied? No family ble&s;&s;ings to be acknowledged?&mdash;Or are we like I&s;rael of old, "who &s;at down to eat and drink and ro&s;e up to play?" &mdash;"She did not know, &s;aith GOD by his Prophet, that I gave her corn and wine and oil, and multiplied her &s;ilver and gold, which they prepared for Baal: Therefore will I return and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the &s;ea&s;on thereof; and I will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedne&s;s."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;ea 2.8, 9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. Children and Servants &s;hould be early taught to read. This is an advantage which the children in a family generally enjoy. But are not our &s;ervants, my brethren, too often for|gotten? How few have the means of in&s;truction? Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have, in&s;tead of being &s;purred to that applica|tion, without which there can be no proficiency, are con&s;tantly interrupted by our many calls. At length ambition flags, and, being di&s;couraged, they trifle away the little time allotted them. Their con&s;equent little progre&s;s is now imputed to a want of genius peculiar to their complexion.&mdash;Now, di&s;tingui&s;hed from his brethren, and highly favoured will be that &s;ervant, who is not left, either to heatheni&s;h darkne&s;s in a <HI>Chri&s;tian land,</HI> or to &s;pell out una&s;&s;i&s;ted the principles of Religion, and every truth which re&s;pects his eternal &s;alvation. Hard is their lot!&mdash;Humanity drop a tear.&mdash;I would here anticipate an objection which may perhaps be made to the idea of <HI>duty</HI> in the relation of Ma&s;ters to Servants.</P>
<P>Objection. Servants bought with our money are our ab&s;o|lute property: and may we not do as we will with our own?</P>
<P>While he, who is not &s;teeled to the feelings of a generous mind, blu&s;hes at this objection; I am not careful to an&s;wer in this matter. But, in a word;&mdash;they are not your own: for they <HI>are bought with a price.</HI> If you alienate them from his &s;ervice who hath <HI>bought them even with his own blood,</HI> the debt contracted on your part will, I fear, render you in|&s;olvent,
<PB N="11" REF="019547_0009_0FABF96E76A201F8">
and con&s;ign you to that pri&s;on whence there is no di&s;charge <HI>'till thou ha&s;t paid the uttermo&s;t farthing.</HI>&mdash;The blood of &s;ouls will be charged to your account.&mdash;Think well, &mdash;How will you di&s;charge it?&mdash;I ha&s;ten to another part of the duty under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="3">3. Early in&s;til the great principles of Religion and Vir|tue. &mdash;Tho&s;e under our care &s;hould be taught that great fir&s;t principle of Religion&mdash;<HI>There is a GOD.</HI>&mdash;As the young mind enlarges, it &s;hould be made acquainted with the glori|ous Perfections of GOD. This will lead to explain and en|force our obligations to him as our Creator, Pre&s;erver and Redeemer. Did the Redeemer when on earth take little children into his arms and ble&s;s them? Can <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> then forget to devote theirs to him who thus loved them?&mdash; Point them to their Saviour on the cro&s;s, and let his agoni|zing death teach them the evil of &s;in, and its dreadful puni&s;h|ment. The beauties of holine&s;s and its glorious rewards, are al&s;o to be &s;et before them in language adapted to their capacities, and calculated to reach the heart.</P>
<P>The beginning of our days is an important part of hu|man life.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t as the twig is bent the Tree is inclin'd."</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent periods of life will take their &s;tamp from that of childhood. Happy is it when the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions are in &s;avour of virtue. To effect this there mu&s;t <HI>be line upon line, and precept upon precept.</HI> The fir&s;t openings of the mind are to be carefully watched; and every opportunity of in|&s;tilling that which is good, faithfully improved.</P>
<P>Here, I am aware, will &s;tart up that frightful &s;pectre, <HI>pre|judice of education</HI>; with which &s;ome men appear panic-&s;truck. To deliver them&s;elves from this, they exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t: 'till at length, having effected their purpo&s;e, their lives &s;hew that to be delivered from, what they call, the prejudice of education is, in other terms, to be dive&s;ted of every virtuous and religious principle. Far be it, however, from any one to &s;uppo&s;e that we &s;hould have no higher &s;up|port
<PB N="12" REF="019547_0010_0FABF970722F6598">
for our principles in religion and virtue, than education. &mdash;A &s;lender &s;upport indeed!&mdash;No; my brethren, the mind properly cultivated will, when matured by age, know its own importance, and &s;earch <HI>whether tho&s;e things are &s;o</HI> which it had received as true.</P>
<P>That the mind of man, in the fir&s;t buddings of rea&s;on, di&s;covers an ardent thir&s;t for knowledge, and, incapable of determining the quality of what is offered, drinks in with avidity what is fir&s;t pre&s;ented is a truth which will not be di&s;puted.&mdash;Since then the mind cannot be kept a blank until brought to maturity: Tho&s;e, who do not chu&s;e to give vir|tuous principles the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t, unavoidably give this advantage to tho&s;e which are vicious. That Society may long be &s;ecured again&s;t the influence of minds thus early formed to the &s;ervice of the enemy of all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, will be the prayer of every friend to virtue and his country.&mdash; But to pur&s;ue our &s;ubject:</P>
<P>With the knowledge of GOD is connected that of our duty to Him, our Neighbour and our&s;elves. Every duty &s;hould be clearly explained and the di&s;charge of it &s;trictly enjoined. Thus did the Father of the faithful approve him|&s;elf faithful in all his hou&s;e:&mdash;GOD him&s;elf bearing witne&s;s for him. <HI>I know Abraham,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that he will command his children, and his hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the way of the LORD.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 18.19.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. To private in&s;truction is to be added the public in|&s;tructions of the Hou&s;e of GOD. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 87.2.</NOTE> Here tho&s;e committed to our care behold the wor&s;hip and order of the Go&s;pel, with its Ordinances and In&s;tructions:&mdash;hear the word of &s;alvation at the mouth of the <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of the</HI> LORD <HI>of Ho&s;ts</HI>:&mdash;and learn that <HI>fear of the LORD which is the beginning of wi&s;dom, and that knowledge of the holy which is under&s;tanding.</HI> For this purpo&s;e was the direction given, Deut. 31.12, 13.
<Q>Gather the people together, men and women and CHILDREN, and thy &s;tranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and
<PB N="13" REF="019547_0011_0FABF979B4CB32A0">
fear the LORD your GOD, and ob&s;erve to do all the words of this Law;&mdash;and that their CHILDREN, which have not known any thing, may hear and learn to fear the LORD your GOD.</Q></P>
<P>When we attend with our children upon the public in&s;truc|tion, the great object in view &s;hould be to train them up in the nurture and admonition of the LORD.&mdash;This, however, will not be the weightier matter of the law where the Pulpit is pro&s;tituted to &s;erve the intere&s;ts of a party&mdash;But, the faithful Mini&s;ter of that Religion which breathes Charity and good-will to man, will not di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in the &s;acred de&s;k, by uttering &s;evere invectives or artful in&s;inuations a|gain&s;t the Mini&s;ters and Churches of other denominations.&mdash; When this takes place, one &s;ays, <HI>I am of Paul</HI>; another, <HI>I am of Apollos.</HI>&mdash;But my brethren, let it be your concern that you and your children <HI>may be of CHRIST.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="5">5. The beginnings of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition are to be cultivated. This &s;uppo&s;es that we &s;tudy the di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e under our care: that we may be able to di&s;tingui&s;h the good from the bad. The tempers of mankind are vari|ous, and require as different modes of cultivation as the various &s;oils under the hand of the di&s;cerning hu&s;bandman. The tender benevolent di&s;po&s;ition is already fitted for the &s;eed. Ha&s;ten therefore to &s;catter the good &s;eed, and 'ere long it &s;hall <HI>yield a joyful crop.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t dawnings of that which is amiable and prai&s;e|worthy &s;hould be encouraged.&mdash;Particularly: that ingenuous &s;incerity which gives the impre&s;s of gold to every other virtue:&mdash;an un&s;haken attachment to truth:&mdash;a mode&s;t and re&s;pectful deportment towards Superiors: an obliging atten|tion to Equals: an ea&s;y conde&s;cention to Inferiors: and that compa&s;&s;ion for tho&s;e in di&s;tre&s;s which leads to imitate him who <HI>went about doing good.</HI> A mind, thus liberally endowed, &s;hould not be left unguarded again&s;t that by which <HI>many &s;trong men have been &s;lain.</HI> Therefore tho&s;e under our care &s;hould be early in&s;pired with &s;entiments which will rai&s;e them &s;uperior to irregular de&s;ires, and <HI>fle&s;hly lu&s;ts which war again&s;t

<P N="6">6. The beginnings of a vicious di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould receive an early and effectual check. Vices are like tho&s;e weeds which, having once taken root, are with the utmo&s;t diffi|culty de&s;troyed. A bad natural di&s;po&s;ition if not early &s;ub|dued will, 'ere long, bring forth nothing but briars and thorns, to pierce a parent's heart with many &s;orrows. To prevent this too often unhappy ca&s;e: the command of a parent &s;hould enforce the motives to virtue.

<P>Permit one to addre&s;s you upon this occa&s;ion, who acknow|ledges that he knows not the joys or &s;orrows of a <HI>Parent</HI>'s brea&s;t: yet, GOD forbid that he &s;hould be a &s;tranger to that re&s;pect and warmth of affection which becomes a <HI>Son:</HI> for <HI>he was his father's &s;on, tender and beloved in the &s;ight of his mother.</HI> Suffer me then: while with fidelity as in the &s;ight of GOD, yet affectionately and with all re&s;pect I <HI>intreat an elder as a father and the elder women as mothers.</HI></P>
<P>I do now be&s;eech you, in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, that you attend to the &s;olemn admonitions of Heaven this day. <HI>Be thou in&s;truc|ted, O Jeru&s;alem!</HI> Let this in&s;tance of aggravated wicked|ne&s;s in one &s;o young, alarm your fears for the little ones committed to your care, and engage you to be ju&s;t to your|&s;elves, to your <HI>Children,</HI> to Society and to your GOD. <HI>The cur&s;e of the Lord is in the hou&s;e of the wicked; but he ble&s;&s;eth the habitation of the ju&s;t.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 3.33.</NOTE></P>
<P>The happine&s;s of an affectionate parent depends much upon the conduct of his children. For the truth of this, fathers, I might appeal to your&s;elves: And doubt not, but that with feelings known only to a <HI>parent</HI> you would declare, with So|lomon, <HI>a wi&s;e &s;on maketh a glad father; but a fooli&s;h &s;on is the heavine&s;s of his mother.</HI></P>

Avoid it, pa&s;s not by it, turn from it, and pa&s;s away: for they &s;leep not except they have done mi&s;chief; and their &s;leep is taken away, unle&s;s they cau&s;e &s;ome to fall. For they eat the bread of wickedne&s;s and drink the wine of violence.

And may GOD in his infinite goodne&s;s, grant, that when you &s;hall take the places of your fathers, you may never have cau&s;e to feel the unutterable pangs of

that parent's heart, who has a <HI>&s;on that is a grief to his father, and bitterne&s;s to her that bare him.</HI></P>
<P>I would now turn my addre&s;s to the whole A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Men and Brethren,</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, in the name of the LORD, to con&s;ider &s;eri|ou&s;ly the things of which you are this day witne&s;&s;es. We have here a &s;triking evidence of the depravity of human nature; that we are indeed <HI>tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors from the womb.</HI> We here &s;ee the natural productions of a heart uncultivated and left to it&s;elf; that indeed, it <HI>is deceitful above all things and de&s;perately wicked.</HI> At one view we now behold the con&s;equences of the fir&s;t apo&s;tacy, and the i&s;&s;ue of actual tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. Surely <HI>the way of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors is hard:</HI> for <HI>he that pur&s;ueth evil pur&s;ueth it to his own death.</HI> Let us there|fore hear and fear and do no more wickedly. <HI>Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers, for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. If thou do that which is evil be afraid</HI>; for ye &s;ee brethren <HI>that they bear not the &s;word in vain; for they are the Mini&s;ters of GOD, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Wherefore be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>Let us learn from what we now behold, that <HI>it is an evil and bitter thing to for&s;ake the LORD our GOD.</HI> Doubtle&s;s the pity of every one pre&s;ent, is excited towards this criminal, thus in the beginning of life condemned to death, and now &s;urrounded by the officers of ju&s;tice, for execution. Indeed, that heart mu&s;t be pa&s;t feeling which can unmoved, be a witne&s;s to a &s;cene like this. But, while we indulge a generous pity for a fellow-creature in di&s;tre&s;s, let us fear le&s;t we fall into a wor&s;e condemnation, as criminals before the Tribunal of Heaven. For thus &s;aith the faithful and true Witne&s;s; <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 3.18.</NOTE> Is this pri&s;oner then condemned? So is the unbeliever.&mdash;Is &s;he held in bonds
<PB N="26" REF="019547_0024_0FABF98BAF8AF5A0">
unto the time of execution? So is the unbeliever fa&s;t bound in the chains of &s;in and fettered by his guilty pa&s;&s;ions unto the final, dreadful day of execution: that day in which <HI>he that made him will not have mercy on him, and he that formed him will &s;hew him no favour,</HI> Let us therefore brethren, <HI>take heed le&s;t there be in any of us an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living GOD. And when CHRIST who is</HI> the believer's <HI>life &s;hall appear, then may we al&s;o appear with him in glory.</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>After having devoted to the &s;ervice of my Auditory &s;o many of the&s;e, to the pri&s;oner, <HI>all-important moments,</HI> I mu&s;t now be indulged in addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to her, in a few words with great plainne&s;s of &s;peech.</P>
<P>To the Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P><HI>Hannah,</HI> the time for you to die is come.&mdash;Yes; poor girl!&mdash;in about two hours, your eyes will be &s;hut by death and you will not &s;ee the light of this &s;un again forever.&mdash; This is the la&s;t time that you will ever hear my voice from this place: for you are now going where I cannot &s;ee you; in&s;truct you; or even pray for you.&mdash;You are going where you will find that tho&s;e things which I have told you are true. &mdash;Yes, you will &s;oon &s;ee that there is a great GOD who loveth goodne&s;s and good people; but <HI>is angry with the wicked every day,</HI> and will puni&s;h forever tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ins are not pardoned before they die.&mdash;You will &s;oon &s;ee that Saviour who came into this world to &s;ave &s;inners. You will one day &s;tand before his Judgment-Seat, and if you do not, this day, truly repent of your wickedne&s;s and tru&s;t in him alone for mercy; he will pronounce again&s;t you a &s;entence infinitely more dreadful than that which has already been pronounced.&mdash;</P>
<P>You are now going to be hanged until you are dead: after that you will know, better than I can tell you, either the joys of Heaven, or the mi&s;eries&mdash;the mi&s;eries&mdash;O my &s;oul!&mdash;the mi&s;eries of hell. Oh <HI>Hannah!</HI> repent of your

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Public may wi&s;h to be informed more particularly re&s;pecting the criminal, <HI>Hannah Ocui&s;h,</HI> than they have yet been: we have collected the following particulars, which it may not be improper to annex as an appendix to the preceding di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>She was born at <HI>Groton.</HI>&mdash;Early in life &s;he di&s;covered the maliciou&s;|ne&s;s and cruelty of her di&s;po&s;ition: as appears from the following fact, which was repre&s;ented in evidence before the grand-jury. When about &s;ix years old, &s;he with a brother about two years older than her&s;elf, meet|ing a little girl at a di&s;tance from the neighbourhood, they endeavoured to get away her clothes and a gold necklace which &s;he had on.&mdash;After beating the child until they had almo&s;t killed her, they &s;tripped her, and di&s;puting about the divi&s;ion of the clothes the child recovered, and getting away came home, covered with blood. This affair was immediately ex|amined into, and the &s;elect-men of the town concluded to bind them both out.</P>
<P>Their mother, who is one of the <HI>Pequot</HI> tribe of indians, is an aban|doned creature, much addicted to the vice of drunkenne&s;s.&mdash;She, it &s;eems, not liking to have the girl bound out; brought her away and left her at a hou&s;e, about three miles from the city of <HI>New-London,</HI> promi&s;ing to return in a few days and take her away again. But &s;he did not return 'till after &s;everal months, when urging the family to keep her longer they at length con&s;ented.&mdash;She continued in this family until &s;he was appre|hended for the crime, for which &s;he was executed.</P>
<P>Her conduct, as appeared in evidence before the honorable Superior Court was marked with almo&s;t every thing bad. Theft and lying were her common vices. To the&s;e were added a maliciou&s;ne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition which made the children in the neighbourhood much afraid of her. She had a degree of artful cunning and &s;agacity beyond many of her years. &mdash;In &s;hort, her mind wanted to be properly in&s;tructed, and her di&s;po&s;ition to be corrected.</P>
<P>We now come to the particulars of the horrid crime for which &s;he &s;uf|fered.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t of July, 1786, at about 10 o'clock in the morning, the body of the murdered child was found in the public road leading from <HI>New-London</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="019547_0027_0FABF98F9366F6F8">
to <HI>Norwich,</HI> lying on its face near to a wall. Its head was covered with &s;tones, and a number lay upon its back and arms. Upon examining the body the &s;kull appeared to be fractured; the arms and face much brui&s;|ed, and the prints of finger-nails were very deep on the throat.&mdash;The neighbourhood were immediately engaged in making &s;earch and enquiry for the murderer. The criminal made u&s;e of her u&s;ual art, to prevent &s;u&s;picion.&mdash;She &s;aid that &s;he &s;aw four boys in her mi&s;tre&s;s's garden near where the child was found: that &s;he called to them for being in the gar|den and &s;oon after heard the wall fall down. After &s;earching and enquir|ing for the&s;e boys to no effect, &s;u&s;picions became &s;trong that &s;he was the guilty per&s;on. On the 22d, &s;he was clo&s;ely que&s;tioned, but repeatedly denied that &s;he was guilty. She was then carried to the hou&s;e where the body lay, and, being again charged with the crime, bur&s;t into tears and confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he killed her; &s;aying if &s;he could be forgiven &s;he would never do &s;o again. The particulars which &s;he then gave, and which ap|peared in the cour&s;e of the trial were as follow.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 21&s;t, &s;he went to a brook which is near her mi&s;tre&s;s's hou&s;e, to get a pail of water:&mdash;when at the brook, &s;he &s;aw the little girl come into the road, going to &s;chool. She immediately ha&s;tened home with the water, and &s;etting it down at the door, ran acro&s;s the gar|den to overtake the child:&mdash;when near her, the criminal jumped over the wall and called to her: offering her a piece of calicoe which &s;he then held in her hand. The child coming to her, &s;he &s;truck her on the head with a &s;tone which &s;he had taken up for the purpo&s;e, and repeating the blows the child cried out, <Q>Oh, if you keep beating me &s;o I &s;hall die.</Q> She continued the blows until the child lay &s;till. But after a few moments, &s;eeing that &s;he &s;tirred; &s;he took her by the throat and choaked her 'till &s;he was dead. Being a&s;ked why &s;he laid &s;tones upon the child. She &s;aid; it was to make people think that the wall fell upon her and killed her.&mdash; Upon being a&s;ked why &s;he killed her: &s;he &s;aid that &s;he had intended giv|ing her a whipping becau&s;e &s;he had complained of her in &s;trawberry time (about five weeks before) for taking away her &s;trawberries.</P>
<P>Such an in&s;tance of deliberate revenge and cruelty in one &s;o young, has &s;carcely a parallel in any civilized country.</P>
<P>When the criminal was fir&s;t committed to pri&s;on &s;he appeared unea&s;y with her &s;ituation; but after a little time &s;eemed to be quite contented and happy.&mdash;She would divert her&s;elf with the children that went to &s;ee her, and frequently would make very &s;hrewd turns upon tho&s;e per&s;ons who made &s;evere remarks upon her.</P>
<P>When arraigned at the bar, &s;he, at the direction of her council, plead "not guilty." During her trial &s;he appeared entirely unconcerned.&mdash; After the verdict was brought in, and &s;he was carried back to the pri&s;on; a per&s;on vi&s;ited her and told her what mu&s;t now be her puni&s;hment; and that &s;he mu&s;t prepare for death, and for another world: &s;he &s;eemed greatly affected, and continued in tears mo&s;t of the day.&mdash;After this &s;he &s;eemed as unconcerned as before, and was very backward in conver&s;ing with the per&s;on who had thus alarmed her fears. It appeared that &s;ome per&s;ons had been there afterwards and encouraged her with telling her that &s;he would not be hung.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="019547_0028_0FABF99089A02838">When &s;he was brought to the bar to receive &s;entence of death, her &s;tu|pidity and unconcern a&s;toni&s;hed every one. While that benevolent ten|derne&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hes his honor the Chief Ju&s;tice, almo&s;t prevented utterance, and the &s;pectators could not refrain from tears; the pri&s;oner alone appeared &s;carcely to attend.</P>
<P>About a fortnight before her execution &s;he appeared to realize her dan|ger, and was more concerned for her&s;elf. She continued nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate until the Monday night before her execution: when &s;he appeared greatly affected; &s;aying, that &s;he was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for her &s;oul. She conti|nued in tears mo&s;t of Tue&s;day, and Wedne&s;day which was the day of exe|cution. At the place of execution &s;he &s;aid very little&mdash;appeared greatly afraid, and &s;eemed to want &s;omebody to help her.&mdash;After a prayer a|dapted to her unhappy &s;ituation, was offered to HEAVEN, &s;he thanked the &s;heriff for his kindne&s;s to her, and then pa&s;&s;ed into that &s;tate which <HI>never</HI> ends.</P>
