<BIBL>ROMANS XIII. 1. 2.</BIBL>
<Q>THE POWERS, THAT BE, <HI>are ordained of God. Who&s;oever, therefore, re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT man is a peculiar object of &s;upreme re|gard, that his happine&s;s and comfort have employed the attention of the almighty creator and pre&s;erver of the univer&s;e, is a truth &s;o evident to all who will look round, attentively, that nothing but the blacke&s;t ingratitude and mo&s;t un|pardonable negligence can prevent their beholding and acknowledging. This, the whole face of na|ture proclaims. Scarcely a vi&s;ible object but man derives from it &s;ome u&s;e or convenience. Light and air, indeed, he enjoys in common with other animals; but numberle&s;s are the ble&s;&s;ings which are peculiar to man: Even tho&s;e very animals, which partake the common benefits, are &s;ubject to his controul and devoted to his u&s;e by their creator.</P>
<P>The di&s;pen&s;ations of God likewi&s;e, all, declare his love: Even the corrections are proofs of his regard; for <HI>He cha&s;teneth whom he loveth, and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he receiveth.</HI> The proofs of God's regard for man are, in &s;hort, &s;o many, and &s;o glaring in nature and the declarations of his
<PB N="06" REF="014793_0005_0F94A90B575FCB90">
word, that, a grateful mind, will readily acknow|ledge whence all his happine&s;s and ble&s;&s;ings come.</P>
<P>Liberal minds have been, ever, &s;tudious to <HI>"vindicate the ways of God to man."</HI> They have been con&s;tant in a&s;&s;erting, that God, in his provi|dence, is, uniformly, pur&s;uing the one grand ob|ject, <HI>the happine&s;s of mankind.</HI> It is, likewi&s;e, an opinion which &s;hould readily obtain our belief, that he intere&s;ts him&s;elf in every thing that concerns that happine&s;s; and that his providence interpo&s;es whenever it is endangered. Nay, it is highly im|pious, 'tis bla&s;phemous, to &s;uppo&s;e that every in|terpo&s;ition of God's providence is not from a bene|volent motive, and with a view to general good.</P>
<P>It is a truth, fully confirmed by daily experi|ence, that the happine&s;s of mankind depends, in a great mea&s;ure, on the well ordering of &s;ociety; on a right admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and a due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to wi&s;e and equitable laws. Since this is evident, beyond contradiction, it cannot be deemed an ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition that the providence of God interpo&s;es in events of &s;uch importance as the political regulations and government of &s;ociety; it is argument ari&s;ing from the infinite goodne&s;s of God, and is confirmed to us by numerous proofs, of divine te&s;timony; all which, clearly, evince the will and intentions of the deity; <HI>that man's welfare is the grand object of his di&s;pen&s;ations; that, with this view, he con&s;tituted laws for them, and that, for this end, he appointed rulers over them.</HI> This reflection mu&s;t occur to every one who will read the &s;criptures with becoming attention: But le&s;t it may have e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of &s;ome who hear me, I &s;hall lay before you a few remarkable
<PB N="07" REF="014793_0006_0F94A90C190CA4B8">
in&s;tances; from all which it will be evident, that <HI>the intentions of God, in the appointment of temporal rulers, was the advancement of general happine&s;s: That the elevation and aggrandi&s;ement of tho&s;e who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by him, proceeded from no partial attachment, but that they were cho&s;en merely for their virtue and piety, and con&s;equently, were better quali|fied to an&s;wer the benevolent de&s;igns of the Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t in&s;tances (Gene&s;is xli. ch.) of God's interpo&s;ition, in the appointment of a tem|poral ruler, is that of Jo&s;eph over the country of Egypt. It was, evidently, his di&s;cretion and wi&s;|dom that cau&s;ed Pharaoh to promote him to that honour, who rightly judged, that none could be &s;o wi&s;e and di&s;creet as him, who had given the &s;tronge&s;t proof of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;pirit of God. It is beyond a doubt, that Jo&s;eph's exaltation was by divine appointment, and to an&s;wer the gracious purpo&s;e of re&s;cuing from death not only Jacob and his hou&s;e (with whom he had entered into cove|nant) but to pre&s;erve Pharaoh and his people from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a &s;evere famine.</P>
<P>The command given to Mo&s;es (Deuter. xvi. 18, 19, 20) when he was ordered to appoint judges and officers over the children of I&s;rael, was, "<HI>Judges and officers &s;halt thou make thee, and they &s;hall judge the people with</HI> JUST JUDGMENT. <HI>Thou &s;halt not wre&s;t judgment, thou &s;halt not re&s;pect per&s;ons; that which is altogether ju&s;t &s;halt thou follow.</HI>"</P>
<P>Among other commands which Mo&s;es received, re&s;pecting the king which God fore&s;aw would be &s;et up among the I&s;raelites, he received this al&s;o (Deuter. xvii. 18 to the end) "<HI>And it &s;hall be when he &s;itteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he
<PB N="08" REF="014793_0007_0F94A90CD53002E0">
&s;hall write him a copy of this law in a book; and it &s;hall be with him, and he &s;hall read therein all the days of his life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his God; to keep all the words of this law and the&s;e &s;tatutes, to do them; that his heart be not lifted up above his bre|thren; and that he turn not a&s;ide from the command|ment, to the right hand or to the left, to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom.</HI>" The&s;e were the terms upon which favour and protection from Heaven were to be continued to rulers, even of DIVINE APPOINTMENT.</P>
<P>God's dealings with Saul, the fir&s;t per&s;on ap|pointed king over I&s;rael, were exactly after the&s;e conditions. Succe&s;s and victory were the fruits of his labours, whil&s;t he turned not a&s;ide from the <HI>holy commandment delivered.</HI> But the prophet Samuel tells us (1 Samuel, xv. ch.) <HI>when he turned back from following the Lord, the Lord al&s;o rejected him from being king.</HI> His &s;ucce&s;&s;our, David, by a more faithful admini&s;tration, continued to enjoy the kingdom to a good old age, and procured a con|ditional promi&s;e of it to his po&s;terity. This great and good man, far from being elated at the di&s;|tinction &s;hewn him by God, &s;aw, clearly, the true rea&s;on of his promotion and the purpo&s;e of God in appointing him: This he confe&s;&s;ed when he was anointed king in Hebron, and repeats among the la&s;t words which he &s;poke. The pro|phet Samuel tells us (2 Samuel, v. 12) <HI>"David perceived that the Lord had e&s;tabli&s;hed him king over I&s;rael, and that he had exalted his kingdom</HI> FOR HIS PEOPLE ISRAEL'S SAKE." In his dying hour he declared (2 Samuel, xxiii. 3) <HI>"He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t; ruling in the fear of God."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="09" REF="014793_0008_0F94A90D98408EA0">
The queen of Sheba ble&s;&s;ed God, <HI>who delighted to &s;et Solomon on his throne. "Becau&s;e,"</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>"thy God loved I&s;rael to e&s;tabli&s;h them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and ju&s;tice."</HI> (2 Chron. ix. 8)</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;criptures, the &s;pirit which runs through the whole of the evangelical writings, coincides to prove that the ble&s;&s;ings derived to mankind by the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, proceeded from the &s;ame divine principle of love. <HI>"Herein is love,"</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle John (1 John iv. 10) <HI>"not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and &s;ent his &s;on to be the propitiation for our &s;ins."</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the love of God to man is &s;o loudly proclaimed by the voice of nature, and the benevolence of his intentions &s;o clearly revealed in his word, and declared in all his di&s;pen&s;ations; yet there are not wanting in the world, tho&s;e, who though they cannot but a&s;&s;ent to the general truths, here a&s;&s;erted, yet deny them in effect. By a&s;&s;erting that contrary opinions are more agreeable to the word and will of God, and more favourable to the happine&s;s of mankind, they deny, in &s;ub&s;tance, what is demon&s;trably proved to be true. They in&s;i&s;t that, though rulers are bound to govern according to the immutable laws of equity, yet an obligation lies on Chri&s;tians to pay an exact obedience to <HI>all their commands:</HI> That no abu&s;e of power will ju&s;tify di&s;obedience; and, however contrary their laws may be to the benevolent de|&s;igns of the creator, that Chri&s;tians are bound to ob&s;erve them with the mo&s;t &s;trict conformity.</P>
<P>They agree that God's care and attention is em|ployed for the welfare of his creatures. They
<PB N="10" REF="014793_0009_0F94A90E54209298">
admit that &s;ocial regulations and the pre&s;ervation of order are nece&s;&s;ary; and that the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice is e&s;&s;ential to peace and &s;ecurity. They agree with us as to the end, but differ concerning the mode; while the mode they contend for, is, as we humbly conceive, de&s;tructive of that very end which all good men de&s;ire, and for which government was, at fir&s;t, e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The advocates for de&s;poti&s;m and an implicit obedience contend, that the licentious and refrac|tory di&s;po&s;ition of man requires a re&s;traint which only an uncontroulable power can lay upon him: That a &s;en&s;e of honour, of religious obligations, and regard for his fellow creatures, are motives too weak to influence him when his own de&s;ires and intere&s;t interfere: And that no power, but one independent and uncontroulable, would make laws &s;ufficiently rigorous to &s;ecure the peace of &s;ociety. They in&s;i&s;t that popular governments are in&s;ufficient for this end; as popular and other un|worthy motives, too often induce men to propo&s;e laws that are de&s;tructive, from their lenity. That it is nece&s;&s;ary an implicit obedience &s;hould be paid to every law of their impo&s;ing, in order to pre|&s;erve the authority of the legi&s;lature; without which, &s;ay they, order mu&s;t cea&s;e, peace be de&s;troyed, and ju&s;tice interrupted.</P>
<P>To give farther weight to the&s;e opinions, they add, that the all-wi&s;e God, fore&s;eeing the be&s;t method of conducting human affairs, has declared, in his revealed will, <HI>it &s;hall be &s;o;</HI> and, among other proofs, they bring in &s;upport of their doctrine the words of my text; which, they &s;ay, amount to a full proof, that God commands and expects
<PB N="11" REF="014793_0010_0F94A910A26E1258">
us to follow, implicity and blindly, every dictate of our &s;uperiours.</P>
<P>That God requires obedience from his people, to all laws that are equitable: That he expects them to be obedient to magi&s;trates and rulers, when <HI>their commands</HI> do not contradict <HI>his own,</HI> is, undoubtedly, true, and abundantly confirmed by his word: But I hope to be excu&s;ed when I can|not agree with them, that mankind are to follow every dictate of their &s;uperiours, without doubting or murmuring. It is a principle &s;o &s;lavi&s;h, that no man who con&s;iders him&s;elf in his true light, as de&s;cended from the common parent of his &s;pecies, can a&s;&s;ent to. It is a doctrine &s;o full of danger tending to de&s;troy every di&s;tinction between right and wrong, and to make ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice depend upon pa&s;&s;ion and caprice: It is a principle &s;o de|&s;tructive in it&s;elf; tending &s;o greatly, to deba&s;e the human mind, and to extingui&s;h every virtuous effort, that if de&s;erves to be rejected by every friend of truth and mankind: And I doubt not to prove, from the example of St. Paul's conduct, that he never meant, by the declaration in my text, to give &s;anction to the crimes of wicked and de&s;potick men.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, <HI>you would, then, have tho&s;e to be judges of right and wrong, from whom nothing is required but obedience; you would have tho&s;e, to govern, whom the laws were intended to re&s;train: How will &s;uch a mode an&s;wer the important point you contend for; the pre&s;ervation of order and ju&s;tice? A &s;y&s;tem of this kind, gives an opening for the mo&s;t flagitious and licentious practices; which, in&s;tead of &s;ecuring,
<PB N="12" REF="014793_0011_0F94A912943AA278">
mu&s;t de&s;troy that peace and harmony you recommend.</HI> I would wi&s;h to have it believed, that I am, by no means, an advocate for anarchy. I am, very fully, convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubordination in &s;ociety, in order to its happine&s;s: But I mu&s;t, &s;till, think, that this happine&s;s is not be&s;t promoted by a &s;cheme of de&s;poti&s;m. Was infallibility con|veyed to man with the powers of government, I would in&s;tantly &s;ub&s;cribe to the doctrine. But, unhappily for human nature, we &s;ee the old Latin proverb <HI>(humanum e&s;t errare)</HI> verified daily; and if any conclu&s;ions may be drawn from the practice and policy of courts and princes, through all ages of the world, we may venture to affirm that, abundantly more determinations have proceeded from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and ambition, than from di&s;inte|re&s;ted and benevolent motives.</P>
<P>Ignorance, darkne&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition, have, ever, had their &s;ource in oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice; while truth and &s;cience have been the con&s;tant attendants upon liberty. The &s;pirit of freedom will, indeed, &s;ometimes, if accompanied with imprudent con|duct in rulers, be attended with di&s;agreeable con|&s;equences: But, few in&s;tances can be &s;hewn where the&s;e con&s;equences have followed, when the publick good alone has influenced the councils of princes. Mankind can, in general, di&s;tingui&s;h between right and wrong; between ju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion; where they &s;ee their rulers actuated by principles of benevolence and a love of ju&s;tice, there needs little el&s;e, than this confidence, to &s;e|cure their obedience: And how happy have tho&s;e periods been, where &s;entiments, of mutual obli|gation and duty, have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between rulers
<PB N="13" REF="014793_0012_0F94A91346342668">
and their &s;ubjects. But how mi&s;erable the &s;tate of that people, who&s;e prince, di&s;daming the ties of humanity and ju&s;tice, trampling on their mo&s;t &s;acred rights, and &s;porting with their wretched|ne&s;s, impiou&s;ly conceits him&s;elf the anointed of God, and dares to pre&s;ume on the authority of Heaven to &s;anctify his crimes.</P>
<P>From the pronene&s;s of man's heart to &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and ambition, little pains need be taken to per|&s;uade him to the belief of opinions that are favour|able to his views and inclinations; the many mi&s;|chiefs which have ari&s;en in the would from the &s;ucce&s;sful arts of &s;ycophants are too notorious to be denied: Much happier would it be for mankind, were princes and rulers, taught, faithfully, to be|lieve the&s;e truths, <HI>that no character, however digni|fied, can give &s;anction to inhumanity and oppre&s;&s;ion; that ju&s;tice and benevolence are principles of univer&s;al obligation; that a mutual obligation &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the governed and their rulers; that the happine&s;s of mankind is the end of their appointment; and that the uprightne&s;s of their conduct will be their be&s;t &s;ecurity for the favour of Heaven and the obedience of their &s;ub|jects.</HI> Where princes are not deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e truths, we may expect nei|ther peace nor happine&s;s where they rule.</P>
<P>If we recur to experience, for &s;atisfaction con|cerning this doctrine, what will that teach us? Will it prove that truth and ju&s;tice have prevailed, more, in free countries? Or, that ignorance and errour have been the in&s;epa|rable attendants on freedom? Will it not, on the contrary, be evident, that in kingdoms where the&s;e principles have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, the mo&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="014793_0013_0F94A91395CD11E8">
in&s;olent tyranny, and mo&s;t violent oppre&s;&s;ions, have been exerci&s;ed upon the wretched &s;ubject by his lordly ruler? This is a truth, with which the world is, but too well, acquainted. How great a part of mankind are, at this day, &s;marting un|der the iron rod of power, and all the calamities which oppre&s;&s;ion can devi&s;e, or tyranny inflict, no one can be ignorant of who is, in the lea&s;t ac|quainted with the affairs of the world.</P>
<P>And can we &s;uppo&s;e, that God is di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e unhappy nations who, when &s;timulated to complaints by the bitter la&s;h of oppre&s;&s;ion, utter their di&s;quietude before him? Did he reprove that di&s;tingui&s;hed people the I&s;raelites, for complaining of the &s;evere treatment of Pharaoh, who <HI>made their lives bitter with hard bondage?</HI> Did he expect that they &s;hould pay a blind obedience to all his ordi|nances? Did he rebuke their murmurs, or refu&s;e to hear their complaints? Surely neither: <HI>"I have &s;een the affliction of my people which are in Egypt,</HI> &s;ays God to Mo&s;es (Exodus iii. ch.) <HI>and have heard their cry, by rea&s;on of their ta&s;k-ma&s;ters: For I know their &s;orrows, and am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians."</HI> What a deliverance he wrought for tho&s;e murmurers and complainers; and what judgment was exerci&s;ed on their oppre&s;|&s;ors, the &s;acred book of God declares.</P>
<P>Upon a review of the &s;ubject; and from con&s;i|dering the many arguments that convince us of God's gracious di&s;po&s;ition towards man: From con&s;idering him as impartial and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate; that he has, manife&s;tly, in his revealed will, de|clared his intentions in appointing temporal rulers, and, clearly, pointed out for them a line of con|duct,
<PB N="15" REF="014793_0014_0F94A9145418C298">
from which they may not deviate without incurring his di&s;plea&s;ure; I cannot be induced to believe, that God will be angry with his creatures for di&s;regarding the injunctions of tho&s;e who have departed from that rule of rectitude laid down by him, and who would force them into mea&s;ures, which, they are convinced, are neither for the advancement of his glory nor their own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Nor can I, upon a candid inquiry, admit that St. Paul meant, by the words of my text, to enjoin Chri&s;tians the practice of this doctrine. In order to under&s;tand him rightly, let us compare the doctrine with his own practices. It would hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed, of Paul, that he would prac|ti&s;e any thing that was contrary to the truths he was preaching: That an apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who was de&s;iring others to walk <HI>as they had him for an example,</HI> would, by the pattern of his life, lead mankind into fatal errours. Yet, we find it re|corded, in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, that this very man, when apprehended and puni&s;hed wrongfully and contrary to the laws and u&s;ages of the Romans, to which nation he was &s;ubject, and entitled to all the privileges of one of their free citizens, did not, tacitly and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, endure it, but com|plained aloud of their inju&s;tice; and appealed to the laws and con&s;titution of his country. We are told (Acts xxii. ch.) that the chief captain of the Roman garri&s;on, in order to &s;atisfy the Jews, was about to examine Paul by &s;courging, and had ordered him to be bound with throngs for that purpo&s;e; but we do not find that the apo&s;tle &s;ub|mitted to his authority, implicitly and without complaining: No; he condemned this conduct,
<PB N="16" REF="014793_0015_0F94A9151ED81E40">
as unju&s;t and tyrannical, and appealed to the Ro|man con&s;titution for that ju&s;tice which he was not like to meet with from the officer. "<HI>Is it law|ful for you,</HI> &s;ays he to the centurion, <HI>to &s;courge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</HI> This re|mon&s;trance had the expected effect; for we are told, <HI>the chief captain was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman and becau&s;e he had bound him;</HI> and, the next day, he was loo&s;ed from his bands.</P>
<P>When the high prie&s;t commanded Paul to be &s;mitten on the mouth, for a&s;&s;erting that, he had lived in all good con&s;cience, before God, until that day; he replied, "<HI>God &s;hall &s;mite thee, thou whited wall, for &s;itte&s;t thou to judge me</HI> AFTER THE LAW, <HI>and condemne&s;t thou me</HI> CONTRARY TO THE LAW?" By which &s;aying he has, clearly marked <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the line of conduct for tho&s;e in power; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> time, left the mo&s;t bitter and morti|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters"> reproof to tho&s;e who have not exerci&s;ed their authority agreeable to this rule.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixteenth chapter of the Acts, we are told <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> when the magi&s;trates of Philippi, &s;ent to di&s;mi&s;s Paul and Silas privately, after they had beaten them openly and uncondemned, who were Romans: they, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to obey the command: <HI>Nay verily,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul, <HI>but let them come, them&s;elves, and fetch us out:</HI> Nor did they go till the magi&s;trates <HI>came and be&s;ought them, and brought them out; and de&s;ired them to depart out of the city.</HI> Here is, beyond contradiction, an in&s;tance where this very Paul, who is &s;aid to have recom|mended pa&s;&s;ive obedience to Chri&s;tians, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to obey the command of magi&s;trates. The rea&s;on, why he did, is obvious; he meant to re|prove
<PB N="17" REF="014793_0016_0F94A915F9778C40">
prove them for the unju&s;t puni&s;hment, inflicted on him and Silas; and for exerci&s;ing their autho|rity in a tyrannical manner.</P>
<P>Again, when Fe&s;tus, willing to do the Jews a plea&s;ure, would have &s;ent Paul up to Jeru&s;alem, to be tried there, he loudly exclaimed again&s;t it; well knowing, how little ju&s;tice he might hope for in that city. <HI>I &s;tand at Cae&s;ar's judgment &s;eat, &s;aid he</HI> (Acts xxv. ch.) <HI>where I ought to be judged. To the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou, very well, knowe&s;t: For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing, worthy of death, I refu&s;e not to die; but if there be none of the&s;e things whereof the&s;e accu&s;e me,</HI> NO MAN MAY DELIVER ME UNTO THEM: <HI>I appeal unto Cae&s;ar.</HI> Here he, po&s;itively, denied Fe&s;tus's right to do what the Jews required; and appeals, for ju&s;tice, to the laws of his country; well knowing that, by them, no man could be delivered to death, <HI>before that he which is accu&s;ed have the accu&s;ers</HI> FACE TO FACE, <HI>and have licen&s;e to</HI> ANSWER FOR HIMSELF, <HI>concerning the crime laid again&s;t him.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the practice of that Paul, of whom it is a&s;&s;erted that he taught the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience. That he, ever, paid the mo&s;t &s;crupu|lous obedience to the e&s;tabli&s;hed and ju&s;t laws of the various nations he travelled through, is rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e. But that he endeavoured to im|pre&s;s Chri&s;tians with the belief that, they were to obey, implicitly, every dictate of power, however unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive, and however contrary to the divine will and intentions, is hardly to be imagined; becau&s;e it is, as we have in&s;tanced,
<PB N="18" REF="014793_0017_0F94A9169377C3C0">
incon&s;i&s;tent with his own conduct at Cae&s;area, at Philippi and at Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>St. Peter be&s;eeches us to &s;ubmit our&s;elves, <HI>to every ordinance of man.</HI> But are we, hence, to in|fer that this is without any exception whatever; or that Chri&s;tians are to pay no regard to the rec|titude of tho&s;e laws, of human authority, to which they pay obedience? This, certainly, never could have been St. Peter's meaning: for we find (Acts iv. ch.) that when he and John were forbid preaching, by the high prie&s;t and rulers, they actually refu&s;ed to comply. <HI>"Whether it be right,</HI> IN THE SIGHT OF GOD, &s;ay they, <HI>to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."</HI> But it may be &s;aid, the&s;e men were acting by immediate com|mand from their &s;aviour; and where his com|mand is po&s;itive, man's is not to be regarded. To which it may be an&s;wered: whenever oppre&s;|&s;ion and inju&s;tice are exerci&s;ed by the ruling pow|ers, the commands of God are broken: That God expects no obedience of his people to tho&s;e who live in daily violation of his commands; who de|&s;troy, by their acts of power, the cau&s;e of truth and the happine&s;s of mankind; and pervert, by their nefarious &s;y&s;tems, the very de&s;ign of &s;ocial regulations. If we would under&s;tand St. Peter, rightly, let us con&s;ider the whole of what he &s;ays, upon this &s;ubject, together (1 Peter ii. ch.) <HI>"Sub|mit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake, whether it be to the king, as &s;upreme, or unto governours, as unto them that are &s;ent by him for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well."</HI> The divine intention in the appoint|ment of temporal rulers, is, here, evidently, de|clared
<PB N="19" REF="014793_0018_0F94A91A430A9850">
to be for the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, to re&s;train vice and cheri&s;h virtue: And while they act conformably to the divine will, 'tis, doubtle&s;s, the duty of every Chri&s;tian a be obedient to their authority. But when they mi&s;take their commi&s;|&s;ion, when evil doers get rewards in&s;tead of pu|ni&s;hment, and the good meet per&s;ecution in&s;tead of prai&s;e; when, not ju&s;tice, but power and &s;elf aggrandi&s;ement are the objects of their pur&s;uit; when ambition prompts, not humanity and bene|volence; when pa&s;&s;ion rules unre&s;trained, and the voice of rea&s;on is drowned by the clamours of &s;en&s;e, will any body, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, &s;ay that it is the duty of Chri&s;tians to pay an entire obedi|ence to their &s;uperiours, or to con&s;ent to, and be aiding in the execution of their wicked purpo&s;es? If the example of apo&s;tles &s;hould have any influ|ence over us, doubtle&s;s no obedience is due, from Chri&s;tians, to the impious and unlawful commands of their &s;uperiours.</P>
<P>To apply this doctrine to our own ca&s;e, and the circum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent times, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider it in another light. Hitherto, I have con&s;idered it as it re&s;pects nations where princes are allowed an ab&s;olute domination; where the power of legi&s;lation is ve&s;ted, &s;olely, in the chief magi&s;trate. And if in countries, &s;o circum|&s;tanced, re&s;i&s;tance, or a di&s;regard to laws, in cer|tain ca&s;es, is not only ju&s;tifiable, but a nece&s;&s;ary duty; how much more ju&s;tifiable is re&s;i&s;tance in a limited monarchy, where the people have an equal &s;hare of <HI>the powers that be;</HI> that power which is ordained of God; the power of legi&s;lation? The
<PB N="20" REF="014793_0019_0F94A91A5F9017E8">
free exerci&s;e of which is the only &s;ecurity that can be found again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>As St. Paul has a&s;&s;erted, in my text, that <HI>the powers which be are ordained of God;</HI> it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to a&s;certain the line of obedience, to know in what hands power is lodged by the con&s;titution of our country. The nature of this con&s;titution having been frequently and fully ex|plained of late, by able pens; and the privileges of the &s;ubject clearly pointed out; I &s;hall &s;pend no time in expatiating on its excellencies and the ble&s;&s;ings which flow from it to mankind. It is &s;ufficient, for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to &s;ay, that by the con&s;titution of England, the lives, liberty and property of every individual are &s;ecured: That the commons, or the body of the people, make one branch of the legi&s;lature; and have a &s;hare of power: That they have not only the power of keeping and enjoying &s;ecurely, peaceably, and at their di&s;cretion the fruits of their hone&s;t indu&s;try, but al&s;o the power of making laws by their repre|&s;entatives, <HI>by them&s;elves cho&s;en;</HI> and that they are accountable to no laws but &s;uch as they in this manner a&s;&s;ent to. It is a fact, agreed to on all hands, that the &s;ubject of England is ve&s;ted with a &s;hare of power and legi&s;lation; and that, whil&s;t he choo&s;es to keep it, no earthly power can, law|fully, deprive him of this privilege. Allowing St. Paul's a&s;&s;ertion to be true, then, in the mo&s;t lite|ral and confined &s;en&s;e that any de&s;pot would choo&s;e to affix to it, it does not appear that, in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between Great Britain and her colonies, the coloni&s;ts are re&s;i&s;ting a power ordain|ed of God, a power to whom they owe obedience,
<PB N="21" REF="014793_0020_0F94A91B1B0D3B60">
an authority they are &s;ubjected to by the con&s;titu|tion of their country. The di&s;pute, as I conceive, is, <HI>whether the king's &s;ubjects in America, their lives and property, are at the</HI> ABSOLUTE DISPOSAL <HI>of the king and his &s;ubjects in England? Whether the legi&s;lature of Great Britain has a right to make laws, binding of America,</HI> IN ALL CASFS WHATSOEVER? The coloni&s;ts think that, if this be the ca&s;e, their &s;ituation is truly &s;lavi&s;h, and are ju&s;tly alarmed for the con&s;equences. They contend that their fellow &s;ubjects in Britain are but their equals: That the power ordained of God; that &s;hare of power which exi&s;ts in the people, is, equally, the privilege of every individual &s;ubject: They in&s;i&s;t that a Bri|ton cannot boa&s;t a &s;ingle ble&s;&s;ing from the con&s;titu|tion, but what an American is, equally, entitled to: They &s;ay the claim of the commons of Britain is an innovation; that it is unnatural, unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive; and de&s;tructive of that equal ju&s;tice and liberty which, by the con&s;titution, was meant to be &s;ecured to all. While, therefore, the colo|ni&s;ts are contending with their equals, only; with tho&s;e who are ordained to have no greater &s;hare of power than them&s;elves: While they refu&s;e obedience to tho&s;e who have no right to exact it; and a&s;&s;ert their rights when it would be highly criminal to re&s;ign them: tho&s;e rights which God has appointed them and the laws confirmed; I cannot be of opinion that they may be charged, ju&s;tly, with a breach of God's ordinances.</P>
<P>Were the people of the colonies labouring to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution; to aboli&s;h monarchy, or even to dimini&s;h the ju&s;t prerogative of the crown, they might, truly, be &s;aid to be re&s;i&s;ting the or|dinances
<PB N="22" REF="014793_0021_0F94A91BD426A548">
of God. But, upon an impartial exami|nation, it does not appear to be the ca&s;e: For whatever may be the wi&s;h of individuals, the bo|dy of the people are firm in their attachment to the con&s;titution; and all the great repre&s;entative bodies have warmly declared their loyalty, and an utter aver&s;ion to a change of government. In all their petitions and remon&s;trances, to the King and legi&s;lature of Britain, they &s;ay their only wi&s;h is to have their former privileges and liberties con|firmed. While, therefore, an oppo&s;ition is carried on upon the principle of &s;elf-defence. While they contend for the pre&s;ervation of that power which alone can render them &s;ecure and happy: While they do not aim at innovation, or to infringe the rights of others, the coloni&s;ts cannot, with the lea&s;t degree of ju&s;tice, be charged with re&s;i&s;ting the ordinances of God. The coloni&s;ts, as St. Paul was, are not free by purcha&s;e but by birth: Though not born in Britain, are as much entitled to the privileges of Engli&s;hmen, as St. Paul was to tho&s;e of a Roman citizen, though born at Tar&s;us. Like him, too, they have a&s;&s;erted their claim and appealed to the con&s;titution of their country for relief from the arbitrary will of man. But alas, their plea is rejected; it, therefore, re&s;ts with the infallible judge to decide the controver&s;y <HI>as to him &s;eemeth good.</HI></P>
<P>I am aware of the objection which the enemies of American freedom are con&s;tantly urging in fa|vour of their preten&s;ions. In my opinion, the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is not a greater ab|&s;urdity than the notion of America's being repre|&s;ented in the Briti&s;h parliament. To attempt a
<PB N="23" REF="014793_0022_0F94A91C96496608">
refutation of this incomprehen&s;ible doctrine would be vain: The voice of rea&s;on and of ju&s;tice are too feeble to be heard amid&s;t the clamours of am|bition and intere&s;t. Many members of the Briti&s;h &s;enate have, of late, intere&s;ted them&s;elves greatly to procure relief from &s;ub&s;cription to the articles of our church; and for this rea&s;on, principally, that the doctrines they contain are incomprehen&s;ible and ab&s;urd: Yet tho&s;e very members, who wi&s;h to be excu&s;ed from acknowledging, publickly, truths which they cannot comprehend, would compel the coloni&s;ts to &s;ub&s;cribe doctrines, which, they are convinced, are neither ju&s;t nor true. Con&s;cience <HI>may</HI> prompt the one, but the <HI>impartial</HI> world can be at no lo&s;s to determine what in|fluences the other re&s;olution. So blind is human nature to its own failings; &s;o deaf to the cries of honour and ju&s;tice, when &s;elf interferes, that what is ju&s;t one day is mo&s;t unju&s;t the next; what, at one time, is truth, is at another time errour.</P>
<P>Upon the principle of &s;elf, alone, can the conduct of the enemies of America be reconciled. The voice of God, of truth, of ju&s;tice, of humanity, are, totally, again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Sophi&s;try may guild over the fa&s;hionable doctrine of expediency, which is, now, become a &s;ub&s;ti|tute for truth and ju&s;tice: We may be told of the <HI>"dignity, &s;afety and welfare of the Briti&s;h empire."</HI> But can the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice add dignity to a &s;tate? Is the &s;afety of a nation increa&s;ed by a diminution of affection and confidence among the &s;ubjects? Or will the decrea&s;e of commerce add any thing to its welfare? And will any body &s;ay that Chri&s;tians are obliged to &s;ubmit, tacitly, to
<PB N="24" REF="014793_0023_0F94A91E4EB18150">
mea&s;ures &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent and de&s;tructive; to obey, pa&s;&s;ively, &s;chemes of expediency and human policy which contradict the laws of ju&s;tice and humanity? If the laws of God are more to be revered than tho&s;e of man's invention, &s;urely the Chri&s;tian is to be ju&s;tified in rejecting whatever is contrary to divine precept.</P>
<P>There, never, was a time when it was more nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the truth of the doctrine laid before you than the pre&s;ent. It has, long, per|plexed the minds of many pious and well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, who have been fluctuating between duty to God and to them&s;elves; and &s;o long as they have acted from con&s;cientious motives, and have endeavoured to make the laws of God the rule of their actions, their conduct is highly commend|able. But it is high time that the mi&s;ts of errour &s;hould be removed from the eyes of every Ame|rican, from every friend to truth and ju&s;tice; that while &s;elfi&s;h and unworthy motives actuate &s;ome, others may not be prevented, by bigotry, from uniting in the mo&s;t important cau&s;e that ever en|gaged their concern.</P>
<P>I would not be thought to &s;tand here, <HI>"a mo|ver of &s;edition"</HI> or an advocate for licentiou&s;ne&s;s. It would ill become this &s;acred place, and the character of a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, to in&s;pirit rebellion and foment di&s;order and confu&s;ion: But it becomes us, highly, to remove every im|pediment from the progre&s;s of truth and ju&s;tice to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of humanity and the common rights of mankind. In a particular manner, it becomes us to vindicate that holy religion we pro|fe&s;s; which does not &s;eem altogether free from
<PB N="25" REF="014793_0024_0F94A91F4866FC58">
danger &s;ince &s;ome late regulations in Britain. The temporal concerns of mankind claim the la&s;t regard of a Chri&s;tian: Things which end with this life, they &s;hould regard with the <HI>indifference of a gue&s;t that tarrieth but a day:</HI> But the cau&s;e of truth, immutable and eternal, &s;hould engage their warm|e&s;t and unremitted attention. The cau&s;e of an innocent and helple&s;s po&s;terity; of millions, yet unborn, plead &s;trongly for the utmo&s;t exertion of our care and vigilance, in defence of their rights: And gratitude to the memory of our ance&s;tors, &s;hould in&s;pire an awful reverence for that noble cau&s;e they have &s;o often &s;tood forth to defend, and which, through their glorious efforts (under God) has been, to this day, pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>To look towards futurity and contemplate po&s;|&s;ible events, is, at this day, painful: The mo&s;t con&s;olatory reflection we now have, is, that the cau&s;e of truth and ju&s;tice is the cau&s;e of God, and that his almighty arm is irre&s;i&s;tible. From the example of pa&s;t times we may, likewi&s;e, draw con&s;olation; the hi&s;tory of which proves, that zeal and unanimity, in a righteous cau&s;e, have often been an overmatch for numbers and power. Next to divine protection, let us place our hopes in, and exert all our faculties to effect this mo&s;t de&s;irable object. Let no man &s;trive, but who &s;hall, be&s;t, &s;erve the cau&s;e of truth and his coun|try. Let di&s;tinctions and prejudices cea&s;e; and let the flame of patrioti&s;m, alone, blaze out to an exce&s;s. O that it may ri&s;e to &s;uch height and power in the bo&s;om of every American, as to con|&s;ume
<PB N="26" REF="014793_0025_0F94A92001B0B188">
every engine and render uneffectual every effort of inju&s;tice, tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>May that great and gracious being, who&s;e friend|ly aid and interpo&s;ition are e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of his creatures, benignly &s;mile upon the cau&s;e of the injured and oppre&s;&s;ed, the ble&s;s all our virtu|ous endeavours. May civil di&s;cord cea&s;e: And may peace, with all its u&s;ual ble&s;&s;ings, be again re&s;tored; never to be interrupted by an unfriendly and unnatural conte&s;t between Great Britain and her colonies.</P>
