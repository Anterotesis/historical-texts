<P>I WAS born within ten miles of the town of Aberdeen, in the north of Scotland; of repu|table parents; at eight years of age, being a &s;turdy boy, I was taken notice of by two fellows belonging to a ve&s;&s;el, employed (as the trade then was) by &s;ome of the worthy merchants of Aberdeen, in that villain|ous and execrable practice, of &s;tealing young chil|dren from their parents, and &s;elling them as &s;laves in the plantations abroad, and on board the &s;hip ea&s;ily cajoled by them, where I was conducted between decks, to &s;ome others they had kidnapped in the &s;ame manner, and in about a month's time &s;et &s;ail for America. When arrived at Philadelphia the Captain &s;old us at about &s;ixteen pounds per head. What became of my unhappy companions I never knew; but it was my lot to be &s;old for &s;even years, to one of my countrymen, who had in his youth been kidnapped like my&s;elf, but from another town.</P>
<P>Having no children of his own, and commi&s;era|ting my condition, he took care of me, indulged me in going to &s;chool, where I went every winter for five years, and made a tolerable proficiency. With this good ma&s;ter, I continued till he died, and, as a re|ward for my faithful &s;ervice, he left me two hundred pounds currency, which was then about an hundred and twenty pounds &s;terling, his be&s;t hor&s;e, &s;addle, and all his wearing apparel.</P>
<P>Being now &s;eventeen years old, and my own ma&s;|ter, having money in my pocket; and all other ne|ce&s;&s;aries, I employed my&s;elf in jobbing for near &s;even years; when I re&s;olved to &s;ettle, and married the daughter of a &s;ub&s;tantial planter. My father-in-law made me a deed of gift of a tract of land that lay (un|happily for me, as it has &s;ince proved) on the fron|tiers of the province of Penn&s;ylvania, near the forks of Delaware, containing about two hundred acres, thirty of which were well cleared and fit for immedi|ate
<PB N="4" REF="048027_0003_1024DC96C230E1F0">
u&s;e, on which were a good hou&s;e and barn. This plea&s;ing me well, I &s;ettled on it, My money I ex|pended in buying &s;tock, hou&s;hold furniture, and im|plements for out of door work; and being happy in a good wife, my felicity was compleat: but in 1754, the Indians, who had for a long time before ravaged and de&s;troyed other parts of America unmole&s;ted, began now to be very trouble&s;ome on the frontiers of our province, where they generally appeared in &s;mall &s;kulking parties, committing great deva&s;tations.</P>
<P>Terrible and &s;hocking to human nature were the barbarities daily committed by the&s;e &s;avages! Scarce did a day pa&s;s but &s;ome unhappy family or other fell victims to &s;avage cruelty. Terrible, indeed, it prov|ed to me, as well as to many others; I that was now happy in an ea&s;y &s;tate of life, ble&s;&s;ed with an affec|tionate and tender wife, became on a &s;udden one of the mo&s;t unhappy of mankind: &s;carce can I &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock which forever recurs on recollecting the fatal &s;econd of October, 1754. My wife that day went from home to vi&s;it &s;ome of her relations; as I &s;taid up later than u&s;ual, expecting her return, none being in the hou&s;e be&s;ides my&s;elf, how great was my &s;urprize and terror, when about eleven o'clock at night, I heard the di&s;mal warhoop of the &s;avages, and found that my hou&s;e was be&s;et by them. I flew to my chamber window, and perceived them to be twelve in number. Having my gun loaded, I threatened them with death, if they did not retire. But how vain and fruitle&s;s are the efforts of one man again&s;t the united force of &s;o many blood thir&s;ty mon|&s;ters! One of them that could &s;peak Engli&s;h, threat|ened me in return, <Q>That if I did not come out, they would burn me alive,</Q> adding, however, <Q>That if I would come out and &s;urrender my&s;elf pri&s;oner, they would not kill me.</Q> In &s;uch deplorable cir|cum&s;tances, I cho&s;e to rely on their promi&s;es rather
<PB N="5" REF="048027_0004_1024DC9B156A8B40">
than meet death by rejecting them; and according|ly went out of the hou&s;e, with my gun in my hand, not knowing that I had it. Immediately on my ap|proach they ru&s;hed on me like tigers, and in&s;tantly di&s;armed me. Having me thus in their power, they bound me to a tree, went into the hou&s;e, plundered it of every thing they could carry off, and then &s;et fire to it, and con&s;umed what was left before my eyes. Not &s;atisfied with this, they &s;et fire to my barn, &s;table, and out hou&s;es, wherein were about 200 bu&s;hels of wheat, &s;ix cows, four hor&s;es, and five &s;heep, all which were con&s;umed to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Having thus fini&s;hed the execrable bu&s;ine&s;s about which they came, one of the mon&s;ters came to me with a tomahawk<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A tomahawk is a kind of hatchet, made &s;omething like our plai&s;terers' hammers, about two feet long, handle and all. They generally u&s;e it after firing their guns, by ru&s;hing on their enemies, and fracturing or cleaving their &s;culls with it, and very &s;eldom fail of killing at the fir&s;t blow.</NOTE> and threatened me with the wor&s;t of deaths, if I would not go with them. This I agreed to, and then they untied me, and gave me a load to carry, under which I travelled all that night, full of the mo&s;t terrible apprehen&s;ions, left my unhap|py wife &s;hould likewi&s;e have fallen into their cruel power. At day break, my infernal ma&s;ters ordered me to lay down my load, when tying my hands again round a tree, they forced the blood out at my fingers ends. And then kindling a fire near the tree to which I was bound, the mo&s;t dreadful agonies &s;eized me, concluding I was going to be made a &s;acrifice to their barbarity. The fire being made, they for &s;ome time danced round me after their manner, whooping, hol|lowing and &s;hrieking in a frightful manner. Being &s;atisfied with this &s;ort of mirth, they proceeded in another manner; taking the burning coals, and &s;ticks flaming with fire at the ends, holding them to my
<PB N="6" REF="048027_0005_1024DC9F56481230">
face, head, hands and feet, and at the &s;ame time threat|ening to burn me entirely if I cried out: thus tor|tured as I was, almo&s;t to death, I &s;uffered their bru|talities, without being allowed to vent my angui&s;h otherwi&s;e&punc; than by &s;hedding &s;ilent tears; and the&s;e being ob&s;erved, they took fre&s;h coals, and applied them near my eyes telling me my face was wet, and that they would dry it for me, which indeed they cruelly did. How I underwent the&s;e tortures has been matter of wonder to me, but God enabled me to wait with more than common patience for the deliv|erance I daily prayed for.</P>
<P>At length they &s;at down round the fire, and roa&s;ted the meat of which they had robbed my dwelling.&mdash;When they had &s;upped, they offered &s;ome to me: though it may ea&s;ily be magined I had but little appetite to eat, after the tortures and mi&s;eries I had &s;uffered, yet was I forced to &s;eem plea&s;ed with what they offered me, le&s;t by refu&s;ing it, they &s;hould re-a&s;|&s;ume their helli&s;h practices. What I could not eat, I contrived to hide, they having unbound me till they imagined I had eat all; but then they bound me as before: in which deplorable condition I was forced to continue the whole day. When the &s;un was &s;et, they put out the fire, and covered the a&s;hes with leaves, as is their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, that the white people might not di&s;cover any traces of their having been there.</P>
<P>Going from thence along the Su&s;quehannah, for the &s;pace of &s;ix miles, loaded as I was before, we arri|ved at a &s;pot near the Apalachian mountains, or Blue-hills, where they did their plunder under logs of wood. From thence they proceeded to a neighbour|ing hou&s;e, occupied by one John Snider and his fami|ly, con&s;i&s;ting of his wife, five children, and a young man his &s;ervant. They &s;oon got admittance into the unfortunate man's hou&s;e, where they immediately,
<PB N="7" REF="048027_0006_1024DCA0F3BF9EA0">
without the lea&s;t remor&s;e, &s;calped both parents and children: nor could the tears, the &s;hrieks, or cries of poor innocent children, prevent their horrid ma&s;&s;acre: having thus &s;calped them, and plundered the hou&s;e of every thing that was moveable, they &s;et fire to it, and left the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed victims amid&s;t the flames.</P>
<P>Thinking the young man belonging to this unhap|py family, would be of &s;ervice to them in carrying part of their plunder, they &s;pared his life, and loaded him and my&s;elf with what they had here got, and again marched to the Blue-hills, where they &s;towed their goods as before. My fellow &s;ufferer could not &s;up|port the cruel treatment which we were obliged to &s;uffer, and complaining bitterly to me of his being unable to proceed any farther, I endeavoured to ami|mate him, but all in vain, for he &s;till continued his moans and tears, which one of the &s;avages perceiving, as we travelled along, came up to us, and with his tomahawk gave him a blow on the head, which felled the unhappy youth to the ground, whom they imme|diately &s;calped and left. The &s;uddenne&s;s of this murder &s;hocked me to that degree, that I was in a manner motionle&s;s, expecting my fate would &s;oon be the &s;ame: however, recovering my di&s;tracted thoughts, I di&s;&s;embled my angui&s;h as well as I could from the barbarians; but &s;till, &s;uch was my terror, that for &s;ome time I &s;carce knew the days of the week, or what I did.</P>
<P>They &s;till kept on their cour&s;e near the mountains, where they lay &s;kulking four or five days, rejoicing at the plunder they had got. When provi&s;ions became &s;carce, they made their way towards Su&s;quehannah, and pa&s;&s;ing near another hou&s;e, inhabited by an old man, who&s;e name was John Adams, with his wife and four &s;mall children, and meeting with no re&s;i&s;tance, they immediately &s;calped the mother and her children before the old man's eyes. Inhuman and horrid as
<PB N="8" REF="048027_0007_1024DCA46B09AB70">
this was, it did not &s;atisfy them; for when they had murdered the poor woman, they acted with her in &s;uch a brutal manner, as decency will not permit me to mention. The unhappy hu&s;band, not being able to avoid the fight, intreated them to put an end to his mi&s;erable being; but they were as deaf to the tears and entreaties of this venerable &s;ufferer, as they had been to tho&s;e of the others, and proceeded to burn and de&s;troy his hou&s;e, barn, corn, hay, cattle and every thing the poor man, a few hours before, was ma&s;ter of. Having &s;aved what they thought proper from the flames, they gave the old man, feeble, weak, and in the mi&s;erable condition he then was, as well as my&s;elf&punc; burdens to carry, and loading them&s;elves like|wi&s;e with bread and meat, pur&s;ued their journey to|wards the Great Swamp. Here they lay for eight or nine days diverting them&s;elves, at times, in barbarous cruelties on the old man: &s;ometimes they would &s;trip him naked, and paint him all over with various &s;orts of colours: at othertimes, they would pluck the white hairs from his head, and tauntingly tell him, 'He was a fool for living &s;o long, and that they &s;hould &s;hew him kindne&s;s in putting him out of the world.' In vain were all his tears, for daily did they tire them&s;elves with the various means they tried to torment him; &s;ometimes tying him to a tree, and whipping him; at other times, &s;corching his &s;urrow|ed cheeks with red-hot coals, and burning his legs quite to the knees. One night after he had been thus tormented, whil&s;t he and I were condoling each other at the mi&s;eries we daily &s;uffered, 25 other In|dians arrived, bringing with them 20 &s;calps and three pri&s;oners, who had unhappily fallen into their hands in Conogocheague, a &s;mall town near the river Su&s;|quehannah, chiefly inhabited by the Iri&s;h. The&s;e pri&s;oners gave us &s;ome &s;hocking accounts of the mur|ders and deva&s;tations committed in their parts; a few

in&s;tances of which will enable the reader to gue&s;s at the treatment the provincials have &s;uffered for years pa&s;t. This party, who now joined us, had it not, I found, in their power to begin their violences &s;o &s;oon as tho&s;e who vi&s;ited my habitation; the fir&s;t of their tragedies being on the 25th of October, 1754, when John Lewis, with his wife and three &s;mall children, were inhumanly &s;calped and murdered; and his hou&s;e, barn, and every thing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, burnt and de&s;troyed. On the 28th, Jacob Miller, with his wife and &s;ix of his family, with every thing on his plantations, &s;hared the &s;ame fate. The 30th, the hou&s;e, mill, barn, 20 head of cattle, two teams of hor&s;es, and every thing belonging to George Folke, met with the like treatment, him&s;elf, wife, and all his mi&s;erable family, con&s;i&s;ting of nine in number, being &s;calped, then cut in pieces and given to the &s;wine. One of the &s;ub&s;tantial traders, belonging to the province, having bu&s;ine&s;s that called him &s;ome miles up the country, fell into the hands of the&s;e ruf|fians, who not only &s;calped him, but immediately roa&s;ted him before he was dead; then, like canni|bals, for want of other food, eat his whole body, and of his head made, what they called, an Indian pud|ding.</P>
<P>From the&s;e few in&s;tances of &s;avage cruelty, the de|plorable &s;ituation of the defencele&s;s inhabitants, and what they hourly &s;uffered in that part of the globe, mu&s;t &s;trike the utmo&s;t horror, and cau&s;e in every brea&s;t the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation, not only again&s;t the authors, but again&s;t tho&s;e who, through inattention, or pu&s;illanimous or erroneous principles, &s;uffered the&s;e &s;avages at fir&s;t, unrepelled, or even unmole&s;ted to commit &s;uch outrages, depredations, and mur|ders.</P>
<P>The three pri&s;oners that were brought with the&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="048027_0009_1024DCAEBB195560">
additional forces, con&s;tantly repining at their lot, and almo&s;t dead with their exce&s;&s;ive hard treatment, con|trived at la&s;t to make their e&s;cape; but being far from their own &s;ettlements, and not knowing the country, were &s;oon after met by &s;ome others of the tribes, or nations at war with us, and brought back. The poor creatures, almo&s;t fami&s;hed for want of &s;u&s;|tenance, having had none during the time of their e&s;|cape, were no &s;ooner in the power of the barbarians, than two of them were tied to a tree, and a great fire made round them, where they remained till they were terribly &s;corched and burnt; when one of the villains, with his &s;calping knife, ripped open their bel|lies, took out their entrails, and burned them be|fore their eyes, whil&s;t the others were cutting, pierc|ing, and tearing the fle&s;h from their brea&s;ts, hands, arms and legs, with red-hot irons, till they were dead. The third unhappy victim was re&s;erved a few hours longer, to be, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;acrificed in a more cruel manner; his arms were tied clo&s;e to his body, and a hole being dug, deep enough for him to &s;tand upright, he was put into it, and earth rammed and beat in all round his body up to his neck, &s;o that his head only appeared above ground; they then &s;calped him, and there let him remain for three or four hours, in the greate&s;t agonies; after which they made a &s;mal fire near his head, cau&s;ing him to &s;uffer the mo&s;t excruciating torments; whil&s;t the poor crea|ture could only cry for mercy, begging to be killed im|mediately, for his brains were boiling in his head; in|exorable to all he &s;aid, they continued the fire, till his eyes gu&s;hed out of their &s;ockets; &s;uch agonizing tor|ments did this unhappy creature &s;uffer for near two hours before he was quite dead. They then cut off his head, and buried it with the other bodies; my ta&s;k being to dig the graves; which, feeble and ter|rified as I was, the dread of &s;uffering the &s;ame fate enabled me to do.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="048027_0010_1024DCB21CF77760">
A great &s;now now falling, the barbarians were fearful, le&s;t the white people &s;hould, by their tracks, find out their &s;kulking retreats, which obliged them to make the be&s;t of their way to their winter-quarters, about two hundred miles farther from any plantations or inhabitants. After a long and painful journey, being almo&s;t &s;tarved, I arrived with this infernal crew at Alamingo. There I found a number of wig|wams, full of their women and children. Dancing, &s;inging, and &s;houting were their general amu&s;ements. And in all their fe&s;tivals and dances, they relate what &s;ucce&s;&s;es they have had, and what damages they have &s;u&s;tained in their expeditions; in which I now un|happily became part of their theme. The &s;everity of the cold increa&s;ing, they &s;tripped me of my cloathes for their own u&s;e, and gave me &s;uch as they u&s;ually wore them&s;elves, being a piece of blanket, and a pair of mocka&s;ons, or &s;hoes, with a yard of coar&s;e cloth, to put round me in&s;tead of breeches.</P>
<P>At Alamingo I remained near two months, till the &s;now was off the ground. Whatever thoughts I might have of making my e&s;cape, to carry them into execution was impracticable, being &s;o far from any plantations or white people, and the &s;evere weather rendering my limbs in a manner quite &s;tiff and mo|tionle&s;s: however, I contrived to defend my&s;elf again&s;t the inclemency of the weather as well as I could, by making my&s;elf a little wigwam with the bark of the trees, covering it with earth, which made it re&s;emble a cave; and to prevent the ill effects of the cold, I kept a good fire always near the door. My liberty of going about, was, indeed, more than I could have expected, but they well knew the im|practicability of my e&s;caping from them. Seeing me outwardly ea&s;y and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, they would &s;ome|times give me a little meat, but my chief food was Indian corn. At length the time came when they
<PB N="12" REF="048027_0011_1024DCB3B6427CD8">
were preparing them&s;elves for another expedition again&s;t the planters and white people; but before they &s;et out, they were joined by many other In|dians.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;now was quite gone, they &s;et forth on their journey towards the back parts of the pro|vince of Penn&s;ylvania; all leaving their wives and children behind in their wigwams. They were now a formidable body, amounting to near 150. My bu&s;ine&s;s was to carry what they thought proper to load me with, but they never intru&s;ted me with a gun. We marched on &s;everal days without any thing particular occurring, almo&s;t fami&s;hed for want of provi&s;ions; for my part, I had nothing but a few &s;talks of Indian corn, which I was glad to eat dry: nor did the Indians them&s;elves fare much better, for as we drew near the plantations they were afraid to kill any game, le&s;t the noi&s;e of their guns &s;hould alarm the inhabitants.</P>
<P>When we again arrived at the Blue-hills, about thirty miles from the Iri&s;h &s;ettlements before-men|tioned, we encamped for three days, though, God knows, we had neither tents nor any thing el&s;e to de|fend us from the inclemency of the air, having noth|ing to lie on by night but the gra&s;s. Their u&s;ual method of lodging, pitching, or encamping, by night, being in parcels of ten or twelve men to a fire, where they lie upon the gra&s;s or bru&s;h, wrapped up in a blanket, with their feet to the fire.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay here, a &s;ort of council of war was held, when it was agreed to divide them&s;elves into companies of about twenty men each; after which every captain marched with his party where he thought proper. I &s;till belonged to my old ma&s;ters, but was le&s;t behind on the mountains with ten In|dians, to &s;tay till the re&s;t &s;hould return; not think|ing it proper to carry me nearer to Conogocheague, or the other plantations.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="048027_0012_1024DCB565CCF8B0">
Here I began to meditate an e&s;cape, and though I knew the country round extremely well, yet I was very cautious of giving the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any &s;uch intention. However the third day after the grand body left us, my companions thought proper to traver&s;e the mountains in &s;earch of game for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, leaving me bound in &s;uch a manner that I could not e&s;cape: at night, when they returned, having unbound me, we all &s;at down together to &s;upper on what they had killed, and &s;oon after (be|ing greatly fatigued with their day's excur&s;ion) they compo&s;ed them&s;elves to re&s;t, as u&s;ual. I now tried various ways to try whether it was a &s;cheme to prove my intentions or not; but after making a noi&s;e and walking about, &s;ometimes touching them with my feet, I found there was no fallacy. Then I re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to get one of their guns, and, if di&s;cover|ed, to die in my defence, rather than be taken: for that purpo&s;e I made various efforts to get one from under their heads (where they always &s;ecured them) but in vain. Di&s;appointed in this, I began to de&s;pair of carrying my de&s;ign into execution: yet, after a little recollection, and tru&s;ting my&s;elf to the divine protection, I &s;et forwards, naked, and de|fencele&s;s as I was. Such was my terror, however, that in going from them I halted, and pau&s;ed every four or five yards, looking fearfully towards the &s;pot where I had left them, le&s;t they &s;hould awake and mi&s;s me; but when I was two hundred yards from them, I mended my pace, and made as much ha&s;te as I po&s;&s;ibly could to the foot of the mountains; when, on a &s;udden, I was &s;truck with the greate&s;t terror at hearing the wood-cry, as it is called, which the &s;avages I had left were making, upon mi&s;&s;ing their charge. The more my terror encrea&s;ed the fa&s;ter I pu&s;hed on, and, &s;carce knowing where I trod, drove through the woods with the utmo&s;t precipitation,
<PB N="14" REF="048027_0013_1024DCB9B225EFB8">
&s;ometimes falling and brui&s;ing my&s;elf, cutting my feet and legs again&s;t the &s;tones in a mi&s;erable manner. But faint and maimed as I was, I continued my &s;light till day-break, when, without having any thing to &s;u&s;tain nature, but a little corn left, I crept into a hollow tree where I lay very &s;nug, and returned my prayers and thanks to the divine being, that had thus far favoured my e&s;cape. But my repo&s;e was in a few hours de&s;troyed at hearing the voices of the &s;avages near the place where I was hid, threatening and talk|ing how they would u&s;e me, if they got me again. However, they at la&s;t left the &s;pot, where I heard them, and I remained in my apartment all that day without further mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>At night I ventured forwards again, frightened; thinking each twig that touched me a &s;avage. The third day I concealed my&s;elf in like manner as before, and at night travelled, keeping off the main road as much as po&s;&s;ible, which lengthened my journey many miles. But how &s;hall I de&s;cribe the terror I felt on the fourth night, when, by the ru&s;tling I made among the leaves, a party of Indians, that lay round a &s;mall fire, which I did not perceive, &s;tarted from the ground, and, &s;eizing their arms, ran from the fire among&s;t the woods. Whether to move forward or re&s;t where I was, I knew not, when to my great &s;urprize and joy, I was relieved by a parcel of &s;wine that made towards the place where I gue&s;&s;ed the &s;ava|ges to be; who, on &s;eeing them, imagined that they had cau&s;ed the alarm, very merrily returned to the fire, and lay again down to &s;leep. Brui&s;ed, crippled, and terrified as I was, I pur&s;ued my journey till break of day, when, thinking my&s;elf &s;afe, I lay down un|der a great log, and &s;lept till about noon. Before evening I reached the &s;ummit of a great hill, and look|ing out if I could &s;py any habitations of white people, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, I &s;aw &s;ome which I gue&s;&s;ed to be about ten miles di&s;tance.</P>

In the morning I continued my journey towards the neare&s;t cleared lands I had &s;een the day before, and, about four o'clock in the afternoon, arrived at the hou&s;e of John Bell, an old acquaintance, where knocking at the door, his wife, who opened it, &s;ee|ing me in &s;uch a frightful condition, flew from me, &s;creaming, into the hou&s;e. This alarmed the whole family, who immediately fled to their arms, and I was &s;oon acco&s;ted by the ma&s;ter with his gun in his hand. But on making my&s;elf known, (for he before took me to be an Indian) he immediately careffed me, as did all his family, with extraordinary friend&s;hip, the re|port of my being murdered by the &s;avages having reached them &s;ome months before. For two days and nights they very affectionately &s;upplied me with all nece&s;&s;aries, and carefully attended me till my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and limbs were pretty well recovered, and I tho't my&s;elf able to ride, when I borrowed of the&s;e good people (who&s;e kindne&s;s merits my mo&s;t grateful re|turns) a hor&s;e and &s;ome cloathes, and &s;et forward for my father-in-law's hou&s;e in Che&s;ter Country, about one hundred and forty miles from thence, where I arrived on the 4th day of January, 1755, (but &s;carce one of the family could credit their eyes, believing, with the people I had lately left, that I had fallen a prey to the Indians) where I was received and em|braced by the whole family with great affection; up|on inquiring for my dear wi&s;e, I found &s;he had been dead two months! This fatal news greatly le&s;&s;ened the joy I otherwi&s;e &s;hould have felt at my deliverance from the dreadful &s;tate and company I had been in.</P>
