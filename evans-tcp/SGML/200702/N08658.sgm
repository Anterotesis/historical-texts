<HEAD>A PREFACE ADDRESSED TO BRITISH COLONISTS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following explicit Ob&s;ervations, only for Corrections and Additions, were intended for the Pre&s;s in October, 1765, when his Maje&s;ty's Colonies were thrown into Commotions by the Stamp-Act, which may account for the Spirit and Freedom of them. They were fir&s;t prepared ha|&s;tily for three Weekly Papers, and recommended to the Printer's Correction, which indeed they greatly wanted, as new and but poorly dige&s;ted Con&s;idera|tions; and as they could not then reach the Pub|lick, are now expediently pre&s;ented to it; for tho' old Flames are greatly abated, they are not yet extingui&s;hed, but may &s;oon blaze afre&s;h, and even con&s;ume us, if not timely prevented, and by di&s;|clo&s;ing the genuine Source of a virtual Repre&s;en|tation, I have clearly &s;hewn, we are not any Way repre&s;ented in Parliament, and of Cour&s;e, that we cannot be con&s;titutionally taxed by it.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h Money-granters, &s;ay they, have a right to tax us: And their injurious Claim has no Ba&s;is but a pretended virtual Repre&s;entation, which is &s;urely but a fictious one; yet our mo&s;t learned and
<PB N="iv" REF="011073_0003_0F854B0BB8086BE0">
worthy Remon&s;trants, &s;o far as I have &s;een their Writings, have left that principal Matter in much Ob&s;curity; and our Freedom never can be &s;ecure, while we may be taxed at Home, under a Colour of Right, as I have clearly &s;hewn in another Place. My Arguments may have been rendered needle&s;s, by &s;uperior Labours on the &s;ame Subject, but I have not &s;een them in my Reclu&s;ion, and therefore &s;ends my own Sentiments abroad; for though our late Grievances are ju&s;tly redre&s;&s;ed, Affairs at Home are &s;till in a fluctuating Condition, and our very impatient Enemies, who can but poorly brook their late Di&s;appointment, yet bold|ly contend we are virtually repre&s;ented by Engli&s;h Commons, and may therefore, be regularly taxed by them.</P>
<P>The Stamp-Act was &s;oon repealed, according to our Prayer, and the importunate Clamours of En|gli&s;h Trade&s;men, after their Tone about us was changed, but a right of taxing us at Home, &s;aid to be founded on a virtual Repre&s;entation, is &s;till warmly in&s;i&s;ted on, even in open Contempt of all our former Remon&s;trances; and &s;urely our ine&s;ti|mable Freedom, as Engli&s;h Subjects, can never be out of Danger, while that unju&s;t Claim is &s;upport|ed by the Power of a Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature. The mo&s;t arbitrary Monarch in Being, may &s;ometimes attend to the humble Complaints of his grieved Subjects, as the Parliament lately did to ours, and &s;till maintain an ab&s;olute Dominion over them, nor was the late unju&s;t Tax taken off us as an arbitrary Impo&s;ition, but under a &s;pecious Pretence of Fa|vour, to a di&s;quieted People, and perhaps more to oblige Briti&s;h Trade&s;men than American Plan|ters. The injurious Claim &s;till exi&s;ts on which it was founded, and not meerly the Stamp-Act, but the momentous Right of Taxation, was and is the important Di&s;pute between England and us; and
<PB N="v" REF="011073_0004_0F854B0C8800A908">
as proper Repre&s;entatives, only may tax us con&s;ti|tutionally, our Adver&s;aries &s;ay, we are virtually repre&s;ented in Parliament, and may therefore be regularly taxed by it, yea, even as con&s;titutionally as Briti&s;h Non-Electors them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This is the only Source of the alarming Conten|tion before us, and if we are virtually repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h Senate, like Non-Electors at Home, we may of Cour&s;e be as ju&s;tly taxed by it as they are, which I now freely confe&s;s, and have clearly proved in the following Pages, would be very up|rightly indeed; but I think &s;ome of my &s;ucceeding Ob&s;ervations not only render &s;uch idle Preten&s;ions evidently groundle&s;s, but even ridiculous to a high Degree, notwith&s;tanding the profound Knowledge of their prejudiced Supporters. The&s;e are my pre&s;ent Conceptions, and &s;hould my brief Argu|ments on that Subject be indi&s;putably conclu&s;ive, and inconte&s;tably demon&s;trate we are not repre&s;ent|ed in Parliament at all, or become a &s;olid Foun|dation for more copious Rea&s;onings that do &s;o, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly be taxed in England, under the fainte&s;t Colour of a con&s;titutional Right, which is the grand Point we &s;hould invincibly prove, if we are able to do it, and not weakly content our&s;elves with the Repeal of the Stamp-Act.</P>
<P>To favour that great End is the principal Inten|tion of this Pamphlet, and yet, all my Arguments relative to it, take up much le&s;s Room, than pre|ceding and following Ob&s;ervations of another Kind, which are not quite in&s;ignificant, and per|haps may not prove intirely fruitle&s;s; but Brevity, Importance, and Clearne&s;s are often connected by the Learned, if the Encomiums of Fame are well grounded, and &s;ome unlearned Writers may po&s;&s;i|bly unite them by an happy Accident at lea&s;t. However improbably &s;uch Things may be, yet they are not utterly impo&s;&s;ible, and to prevent the
<PB N="vi" REF="011073_0005_0F854B0D2F983C10">
trouble of fruitle&s;s Critici&s;m, ill-natured Cavilling, and vain-glorious Carping, I confe&s;s my&s;elf a Stranger to Schola&s;tick Embelli&s;hments; but mu&s;t al&s;o take leave to ob&s;erve, that genuine mental Trea&s;ure, never &s;hould be contemned, for want of meer ine&s;&s;ential Ornaments; the mo&s;t curious De|vices and Impre&s;&s;ions, at Coining, can never heigh|ten the intrin&s;ick Worth of pure Gold, nor the Want of them impair it; and Bible-Wor&s;hipers &s;hould unanimou&s;ly acknowledge, that Providen|tial Di&s;putants them&s;elves, even the very greate&s;t of them, have been utter Strangers to them Arts and Sciences now called liberal.</P>
<P>This Truth mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed by well informed Scripturians; and yet a predicted Antichri&s;tiani&s;m is grown &s;o rampant, that I know a Chri&s;t-like Teacher, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as much human Learning as his Ma&s;ter, who is proudly contemned for Want of Scholar&s;hip, as well as cautiou&s;ly open Chri&s;tian Reprehen&s;ions, and not only by haughty learned Dei&s;ts, but &s;everal vain glorious Impo&s;tors al&s;o, bla&s;phemou&s;ly called Chri&s;tian Divines, and formerly honoured accordingly, while &s;ome of them evidently prefer notorious Courtezans to true Evangeli&s;ts, and while others, not quite &s;o audacious, with &s;ome renowned Laymen, dare impiou&s;ly keep &s;uch in|carnate Fiends in Countenance, and profanely help them to abandon Shame, becau&s;e they can drink Wine, wear Velvet, pervert Learning, &s;ooth the fa&s;hionably ungodly, and excite Laughter, though but very frothily, con&s;idering their Education and Experience.</P>
<P>True Advocates for a rigidly holy Go&s;pel will hardly e&s;cape Contempt, the Fear of God effectu|ally &s;tem evil Di&s;po&s;itions among nominal Chri&s;ti|ans, nor our &s;avage Enemies be reclaimed from Cruelty, while &s;uch Antichri&s;tian Apo&s;tles, &s;uch gracele&s;s Dictators, &s;uch traitorous Wretches are
<PB N="vii" REF="011073_0006_0F854B0DECC9D9D0">
awfully &s;uffered to pre&s;ide over the Church, and kindly &s;miled on by Probationers of Under&s;tanding, Reputation, and Influence. Well may a true A|po&s;tolical Zeal, Reproof, and inflexible Holine&s;s be ridiculed, and offen&s;ive Truth called abu&s;ive and &s;landerous, while their mo&s;t flagrantly perfidi|ous Enemies are honoured as Chri&s;tian Teachers, and while our Legi&s;latures connive at their horrid Trea&s;on, or at the evident Ungodline&s;s of any Per|&s;on called a Divine; their Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity is an In&s;ult to its &s;lighted Author, notwith&s;tanding they pretend to believe he will finally judge them.</P>
<P>I hate Bigotry, Super&s;tition, and &s;tupid prie&s;tly Dogmas, &s;anctimoniou&s;ly founded on trying Figures, as well as a holy &s;acerdotal Perfidy; but am &s;orry a pure practical Fear of our Heart viewing Creator, Judge, and Rewarder, &s;hould be ab&s;urdly deemed Folly, and the contrary Wi&s;dom, by any of our leading and learned Sages, or even their weake&s;t Inferiors of common Sen&s;e, for &s;uch Conclu&s;ions are far beneath the real Dignity of the human In|tellect, and never can favour the great <HI>Summum Bo|num</HI> of moral Agents, by exciting them to a no|ble voluntary Di&s;cipline, in the mid&s;t of a trying Patience, and free Probation, according to the Law of a pure rational Faith; and compul&s;ive Di&s;plays mu&s;t not, cannot wait upon a State Tryal, for there could be no Probation under con&s;training Exhibitions. Such deadly Notions cannot po&s;&s;ibly proceed from Wi&s;dom or Virtue, nor ever tend to the Promotion of either, but even quite the Re|ver&s;e, in a higher or lower Degree, whatever the mo&s;t idolized dei&s;tical Philo&s;ophers, or their mo&s;t under&s;tanding Votaries, may loftily &s;ay, or blindly think to the contrary; and even infatuated Athe|i&s;ts are more con&s;i&s;tent than Slighters of a confe&s;|&s;ed God. A carnal Clergy, and their learned Oppo|nents, have long exploded each others gro&s;s Errors,
<PB N="viii" REF="011073_0007_0F854B0EAB796CD0">
and fondly perverted Knowledge in favour of their own, with an equal mixture of Sophi&s;try, and Confidence; both Parties have evaded the Rigour of a brave &s;elf conquering Warfare, by wre&s;ting try|ing Figures in a different Manner.</P>
<P>But, after this flaming unfa&s;hionable Digre&s;&s;ion, which an&s;wers a &s;pecial Purpo&s;e, and &s;hould pro|mote a general Good, I mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that all the Pageantry of human Learning, can never make bad Men good Ones, nor injurious, ab&s;urd, trifling, or unintelligible Productions valuable and prai&s;e-worthy, nor the Want of it, render the Rever&s;e ju&s;tly contemptable, even in the lea&s;t De|gree, and e're many Years attend upon us, if I am not greatly deceived, the mo&s;t adored Gods of the Earth, notwith&s;tanding their Philo&s;ophical Om|ni&s;ciency, will be awfully &s;urprized at the alarming Dictates of an unlearned, yet ob&s;cure, and even much de&s;pi&s;ed Pen, after its Fortitude has out|braved a rigid Di&s;cipline, heavy Di&s;appointments, a pungent Ridicule, and other very grievous Trials.</P>
<P>Guilded Pills may be rank Poi&s;on, when un|guilded ones are conducive to Health; a fair Wo|man may be a ba&s;e Pro&s;titute, when a virtuous Matron has a contrary A&s;pect; and even a Man of great Capacity may be a Fool, when one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fewer Talents is truly wi&s;e, through a counter Application of Knowledge. Should I purcha&s;e immortal Happine&s;s with my one Talent, I am &s;urely wi&s;er than Men that buy endle&s;s Sorrows with ten; however, &s;uch knowing Fools may vaunt again&s;t me, and pernicious, or inadequate Argu|ments may be artfully cloathed with &s;hining Lan|guage, when divine Truth it&s;elf is de&s;titute of &s;uch delu&s;ive Ornaments.</P>
<P>Men &s;hould honour momentuous In&s;truction more than frivolous Niceties; and mo&s;t of the &s;uc|ceding
<PB N="ix" REF="011073_0008_0F854B0F614F2150">
Ob&s;ervations, or at lea&s;t the mo&s;t mate|rial of them &s;hould have been corrected by the Printer, when they were fir&s;t hurried very imper|fectly out of my Hands, and might all have been &s;oon put now into a modi&s;h Dre&s;s, by one or other of our learned Rabbins, had not weighty Con&s;ide|rations forbid it, which may timely appear to the World; but all the Punctilios of the Schools can never &s;ecure our Freedom, nor demon&s;trate the Parliament has no Right to tax us; and &s;hould my Arguments without them effectually do it, or ena|ble others to evince it inconte&s;tably, they &s;hould not be utterly de&s;pi&s;ed by learned Americans, even the mo&s;t eminent Profe&s;&s;ors in our Infant Semi|naries, how ju&s;tly &s;oever their Superiors at Home may contemn them, in the tran&s;cendently matured. Univer&s;ities of England.</P>
<P>I greatly prize the valuable Labours of good learned Writers, and would not offend any of them by the&s;e extorted Hints, nor meanly degrade hu|man Learning becau&s;e I am de&s;titute of it, but would gladly induce my learned Readers to guard again&s;t Prejudice, they will of Cour&s;e be tempted to imbibe, and to prefer e&s;&s;ential Worth to ine&s;&s;en|tial Decorations, how pretty &s;oever the latter may appear, le&s;t my own rough Performances &s;hould generally meet but a poor Reception, and perhaps much wor&s;e than they really de&s;erved. No doubt &s;uch inaccurate Ob&s;ervations, though ever &s;o wor|thy of a moral Re&s;pect, will be treated but coolly at lea&s;t by vain Criticks, that judge of Arguments as beaui&s;h Coxcombs do of Per&s;ons, and can al|low none to be valuable but what are fa&s;hionable; but however they may fare in the Hands of learn|ed Cavillers, I think they may be &s;ooner carped at than fairly refuted, and &s;eemingly di&s;dained than utterly contemned; and could &s;uch inartificial Re|&s;onings po&s;&s;ibly excite Envy, truly, great Men

<P>POLITICAL Briti&s;h Coloni&s;ts, exert your|&s;elves nobly, while your Ability may pro|bably favour a maltraited Country, which calls very loudly for your &s;peedy A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and bend humbly to Fear, e'er Di&s;pair waits upon us; a Fire is already kindled in our habitable De&s;arts, which, if not timely extingui&s;hed, may even rage into a general Conflagration, and finally con|&s;ume us; for we have not only plenty of Combu|&s;tibles, but have al&s;o great Rea&s;on to fear many ex|citing Bla&s;ts; and yet I doubt our Gentlemen of Under&s;tanding and Lei&s;ure, are generally amu&s;ing them&s;elves with u&s;ele&s;s Speculations, indige&s;ted I|deas, fruitle&s;s Complanits, dangerous Re&s;olutions, and unprofitable Prote&s;tations at lea&s;t, which never can defend our con&s;titutional Rights, either by convincing the Parliament of its oppre&s;&s;ive Error, or &s;teming its formidable Power again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Our open Colonies, in a State of Minority, are alarmingly threatned with unnatural Encroach|ments, from a haughty Parent Country, that &s;hould treat them affectionately, even with a tender Guar|dian Friend&s;hip; and we complain warmly of her arbitrary Treatment, but to what rational Purpo&s;e do we inveigh again&s;t it, while there are &s;o few rea&s;onable Efforts to avert the impending Danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I had &s;een no weighty Arguments on the Subject, when the&s;e Complaints were utter'd, in 1765, but &s;ome valuable Con&s;iderations upon it were then publi&s;hed, which came to Hand a few Days after, and I fear my Complaints have yet &s;ome Foundation; for great Emergencies require great Efforts, and no doubt, many able Writers have been much too negligent. I under&s;tand &s;ome very good Pens have lately been at Work; but one of the worthy Father's Twelve Letters, and one of the Virginia Monitor's florid Epi&s;tles, are all I have yet &s;een of their laud|able Productions, in the mid&s;t of a very &s;ingular Retirement; and I wi&s;h they may yet obtain many new A&s;&s;i&s;tants; for when imminent Danger is &s;wiftly approaching, no formidable Ca&s;|tle of Defence can be &s;peedily fini&s;hed, without a great Num|ber of good Arti&s;ts of different Kinds, and the Materials they &s;e|verally prepare, will ever be &s;cattered about for &s;ome Time, like the various Materials of other Artificers, before they are properly ranged in the much wanted Fortre&s;s, according to the Laws of a compleat Martial Architecture.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;uitable Hints may ju&s;tify my patriotick Complaints, and &s;hew more Labourers are much wanted to a&s;&s;i&s;t them wor|thy Men already employed, for &s;ufficient Materials mu&s;t be fitly prepared, before the great Work can po&s;&s;ibly be com|pleated; and the Materials of grand moral Structures, as well as others, mo&s;tly want &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Changes, and &s;ometimes very great ones, after they are fir&s;t collected from proper Fore&s;ts and Mines; &s;o as better Arti&s;ts have been too backward, I have endeavoured to forward the important Work a little, tho' I can but poorly attend on &s;uch Labours, and even but rough|ly perform them, as they are quite foreign to my proper Oc|cupation.</P></NOTE>.

Free Complaints, and bold Prote&s;tations, will &s;ure|ly inflame wilful Oppre&s;&s;ors; and &s;hould our Rights only be invaded, through a plau&s;ible Mi|&s;take, &s;ound Rea&s;oning and Evidence alone can remove it; nor may any Thing el&s;e ju&s;tify &s;pirited Declamations again&s;t our Superiors, however they may be palliated through &s;urpri&s;ing Provocations.

<P>My &s;ucceeding Freedom, without an argumen|tative Authority, would render me ju&s;tly obnoxi|ous to cen&s;ure, but I hope to ju&s;tify it by &s;ound geometrical Rea&s;oning, before I have done, and dare therefore introductively &s;ay, without any far|ther Prelude, hath a victorious England, with our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, exempted us from the Incur&s;ions of our French Neighbours, and partly intimidated our

Indian Enemies, that &s;he may tyrannically en&s;lave us her&s;elf? Should that be our deplorable Lot, would not their accidental Inroads, be le&s;s griev|ous than her perpetual Chains? And how intole|rable is lordly Oppre&s;&s;ion, from a hard hearted Parent, that &s;hould be our mo&s;t endearing Guar|dian and Protector! How &s;hocking are the arbi|trary Beginnings alluded to; and &s;hould Principals which gave them Exi&s;tence prove long liv'd and fruitful, what a horrid Brood of fatal Con&s;equences mu&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ively attend us, while we labour under the heavy and galling Yoak! Should our potent Mother greatly ama&s;s &s;uch mental Trea&s;ure, judge, my inattentive Brethren, yea, judge timely and ripely, what a fine Patrimony will de&s;cend to her American Children.</P>
<P>Let us even grant our late War was partly un|dertaking, and very gallantly maintained for our Intere&s;t, as well as the Advantage of Great-Britain, and that we &s;hould con&s;equently defray a &s;mall Part of the Expence, proportioned to our &s;traight Con|dition, if it is not fully done already, or help to &s;upport a &s;ufficient Number of &s;tanding Forces, which in peaceable Times will be but a few; and would our Circum&s;tances even admit of it, we never &s;hould maintain many to oppre&s;s us. Let us ever de&s;erve Fidelity and Affection, and not be en&s;laved under a Pretence of being guarded. We may be driven to Di&s;traction, then called Rebels, and treated accordingly; but Oppre&s;&s;ion only will cau&s;e a general Di&s;loyalty, whatever invidious Cla|mours, di&s;appointed Ambition and Avarice, may &s;ometimes rai&s;e again&s;t ju&s;t Monarchs; and when affectionate Subjects are rendered unea&s;y, by inju|rious Treatmen, they &s;hould not be loaded with cau&s;ele&s;s Expences, as dangerous Malecontents, through the immoral Jealou&s;y and Perver&s;ene&s;s of their Oppre&s;&s;ors, who naturally &s;u&s;pect Aver&s;ion they con&s;ciou&s;ly de&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="011073_0013_0F854B135C3515A8">
Let us be treated fairly, and behave dutifully, for we have &s;ome Property &s;cattered about in this exten&s;ive Wilderne&s;s, and &s;hould, doubtle&s;s, be at a rea&s;onable Expence, according to our &s;mall For|tunes and Occa&s;ions; but let our Enemies al&s;o confe&s;s it &s;hould be a voluntary one, and that we &s;hould be uprightly permitted, as free Briti&s;h Sub|jects, to grant or withhold our Money di&s;cretional|ly, without having it violently extorted from us. Let us be active, voluntary, and prudent Loyali&s;ts, and not pa&s;&s;ive Va&s;&s;als in arbitrary Chains.</P>
<P>But while we complain warmly of over-bearing Treatmen, let us wi&s;ely con&s;ider where it came from, and that it chiefly proceeded from our a&s;&s;um|ing Fellow Subjects; for we mu&s;t know the princi|pal Authors of it, before our Remon&s;trances can be properly directed: The Prince only pa&s;&s;ed the Law we complain of, after the Commons of En|gland, as our pretended Repre&s;entatives, had in|juriou&s;ly prepared it for his A&s;&s;ent; and the be&s;t and greate&s;t of Monarchs, as frail Men, may often be deceived by pernicious Schemes, which plau&s;i|bly advance their Revenues, or any other favou|rite Purpo&s;e, and more e&s;pecially young Princes, e'er mature Knowledge befriend them, which due Experience only may give. When plea&s;ing Offers have a fair Complexion, they are too frequently embraced without a proper Examination, and mo|mentous Affairs are often but &s;lightly viewed at very magnificent Courts; for they occur too often to occa&s;ion Surpri&s;e, or even a deep Attention, amid&s;t all the Interruptions attending Augu&s;t Roy|alty, unle&s;s &s;ome very alarming Circum&s;tances wait upon them.</P>
<P>We may thus clearly &s;ee how virtuous young Princes, who tenderly love their People, may &s;oon follow plau&s;ible gratifying De&s;igns, into very con|&s;iderable Errors, when even mo&s;t of the greate&s;t

Politicians in the Nation, artfully combine to de|ceive them about remote Colonies, in a very ex|ten&s;ive Empire. A Prince mu&s;t &s;urely be very tall indeed who can view his far di&s;tant Subjects clearly, when a great Number of very tall Men, and his own lofty De&s;ires al&s;o, &s;tand crouded before him, and &s;trive to intercept his Sight.</P>
<P>In the Ca&s;e before us, as the publick Debt is very heavy, the Nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing Money is con|&s;equently apparent; and a young Prince, under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, equally de&s;irous of increa&s;ing the Revenue, and mitigating the Burthens and Clamours of his &s;urrounding Subjects, might pa&s;s the Stamp-Act from equitable Motives, worthy of a good Monarch, without maturely con&s;idering the more di&s;tant Con&s;equences of it, when he was even much excited to give it Authority by the Publick, as well as private Council of England, and had no weighty Repre&s;entation again&s;t it. Let us but con&s;ider the prevailing Clamours of the Nation, the general Bent of the Parliament, the King's &s;trong Motives to concur with it, e&s;peci|ally in Money-Bills, and what Party &s;urrounded the Throne, when the Stamp-Tax was impo&s;ed, and then our Surpri&s;e at the royal A&s;&s;ent, mu&s;t intirely vani&s;h.</P>
<P>Briti&s;h Princes mu&s;t needs be very unwilling to di&s;&s;ent to Money-Bills, or any other Favourite Projection of the Money-granting Commons; and all Kings are naturally fond of Power, and rai&s;ing the Revenue; and though the Stamp-Act greatly wounded the Power of the Crown, and even ren|dered the Grants of our Sovereigns contemptable, &s;o far as it annulled the Force of our Charters, and made us fear more arbitrary Proceedings, yet, it gave the Prince a new Power over us, which might &s;eem more advantageous at that delu&s;ive Juncture; and no Wonder therefore, it obtained his A&s;|&s;ent,

<P>The morally thinking Part of us mu&s;t &s;ay, we ought to be taxed, according to our Circum&s;tances and Occa&s;ions, but not to defend exten&s;ive Con|que&s;ts we have no Advantage from, and which may perhaps injure our Trade at length, by help|ing to glut all our Markets abroad. We &s;hould doubtle&s;s be liable to expedient Impo&s;itions; but when and by whom they &s;hould be laid upon us, and what they &s;hould occa&s;ionally be, both in Na|ture and Degree, are the grand Matters in Debate; and if a&s;&s;uming Briti&s;h Commons have a Right to tax us at all, they have equally a Right to do it at Plea&s;ure, and even in what Manner they plea&s;e continually, which would reduce us to Va&s;&s;alage beyond Di&s;pute, for we could lay them under no con&s;titutional Obligation, as we &s;hould have no Power to continue or change them, however they behaved, and could have no Advantage Engli&s;h Non-Electors con&s;titutionally enjoy, as I hope to &s;hew clearly by and by.</P>
<P>No ab&s;olute Monarch is more independent of his People, than Briti&s;h Commons are of our Favours and Frowns; and &s;hould it even be our wretched Lot to be taxed by them, what good Treatment can we expect from lofty Oppre&s;&s;ors, after all our free and provoking Complaints, who treated our Petitions with the utmo&s;t Di&s;dain, before we had incured their formidable Di&s;plea&s;ure, for only be|ing repugnant to their Money-rai&s;ing Will!

<P>We came here to improve a lone&s;ome Wilder|ne&s;s, with Power to make whole&s;ome Laws for the gradual Advancement of our Intere&s;t; and what may all our Charters, provincial A&s;&s;emblies, and legi&s;lative Regulations avail us, if England &s;hould

This is not only a requi&s;ite Privilege, found|ed on true Morality, but even one in&s;eperably in|terwoven with the Law of Briti&s;h Taxations; and how hardy therefore mu&s;t Engli&s;h Senators be, that would cruelly rob us of it, when their arbitrary Dreams are exchanged for true Ideas!

Delegates only may tax us as Briti&s;h Subjects; and &s;uch Strangers to us and our Circum&s;tances are not blindly cho&s;en to repre&s;ent us; and if they dare outrun a con&s;titutional Ju&s;tice, they will hardly guard our Weal from natural Motives, as their private Intere&s;t has no Connection with ours.

<P>Were but Engli&s;h Politicians dive&s;ted of Preju|dice, they might find much better Employ than plotting again&s;t our Liberty, for great Regulations are wanting in this Part of the Briti&s;h Empire, both concerning the Demands of the Crown upon it, and apportioning our Grants to the various Cir|cum&s;tances of the Colonies; for we &s;hould judge of the Expediency or Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the form|er, with a Parliamentary Order, and con&s;titutional Freedom, and divide the latter regularly among us, which cannot be done in our pre&s;ent di&s;united Con|dition. I think it is very demon&s;trable, that all our Grants to the Crown &s;hould be general, for were Supplies ever &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and we ever &s;o able to grant them, I fear the King would not timely obtain an adequate A&s;&s;i&s;tance in our pre&s;ent loo&s;e Situation; and &s;hould all the Requi&s;itions of a Briti&s;h Mini&s;try, by highly expedient, which is no very probable Suppo&s;ition, yet the re&s;pective Quotas of many young Provinces, under various Advantages and Degrees of Improvement, could not be &s;o exactly pointed out at Home, as here; nor &s;hould unju&s;t Demands ever be granted, though ever &s;o fitly proportioned to our Circum&s;tances, yet &s;ome Colonies no doubt would comply with them, under the irregular Plan of &s;pecial Applica|tions,

and others reject the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Requi|&s;itions, &s;o keep Things in perpetual Di&s;order a|mong us, and con&s;equently in England al&s;o.</P>
<P>A great Number of unconnected Colonies, va|riou&s;ly inclined from the Influence of very diffe|rent Views and Apprehen&s;ions, will hardly come under regular Taxations for a publick Good, while each may con&s;titutionally reject any Part, or even the Whole of every Claim from the Crown; but were they politically united for the Purpo&s;e before us, all their private Views might be ju&s;tly over|ruled for a publick Utility, and our Sovereigns requi&s;ite Demands be &s;peedily honoured without either unrea&s;onable Burthens or Exemptions. Thus a general Aid would al&s;o kindly attend on every &s;pecial Emergency, and perhaps occa&s;ionally prevent in&s;upportable Exigencies, which might o|therwi&s;e di&s;tre&s;s particular Provinces alternately, while we are liable to the barbarous Incur&s;ions of bloody Savages; and &s;urely no &s;trait and &s;hort-&s;ight|ed provincial Patrioti&s;m, but the more generous Direction of a publick Spirit only, can po&s;&s;ibly ex|cite a Marylander to write in this Strain. A pro|vincial Utility no doubt &s;hould be favoured, when it &s;tands not in Competition with an imperial Good; but when a publick and private Intere&s;t happen to be temporary Rivals, the former &s;hould ever be wi&s;ely preferred, and even for the la&s;ting Security and Promotion of the latter.</P>
<P>For the&s;e weighty and obvious Rea&s;ons, let us have an American Parliament, as well as provin|cial A&s;&s;emblies, and be gently tied together, with the plea&s;ant Chords of a Sovereign Policy, in&s;tead of the galling Chains of a threatned Slavery. Let us throw our Mites dutifully into the imperial Trea&s;ury, but let us do it on a moral Plan, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and as loyal Engli&s;h Subjects, without a groundle&s;s and immoral Compul&s;ion.

<P>Where Voters and Non-Voters have the &s;ame Dependence and Intere&s;t, there cannot be a Legal without a virtual Repre&s;entation; and had our Co|lonies a &s;ufficient Number of faithful Delegates in the Briti&s;h Senate, well acquainted with all their Concerns, a Part of each provincial Society would be virtually repre&s;ented by them; but I mu&s;t be dreaming or delirious, if it be not even ridiculous to &s;ay we are now virtually repre&s;ented at <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> by a&s;&s;uming Strangers to us and our fluc|tuating Affairs, unle&s;s a Parliamentary Significati|on of the Words <HI>Virtually,</HI> and <HI>Repre&s;ented,</HI> be quite foreign to the common Acceptation of them.</P>
<P>Briti&s;h Non-Electors may be as ju&s;tly taxed at Home, as our Non-Voters are here; for the nume|rous Commons of England, are not only collected from every County, and every City, but even from more inferior Boroughs al&s;o than there are very con&s;iderable Towns in the Kingdom, though &s;ome large Towns want Borough Privileges, and have therefore properly before them, all the vari|ous Kinds of Manufactories, Modes of Agricul|ture, and Branches of Trade, a national Pro&s;pe|rity

This well known Fact will hardly be di&s;puted; and the immemorial Claim of the Money-granting Com|mons is intirely founded on this laudable Argu|ment, that as their numerous Con&s;tituents bear the principal Burthen, they &s;hould be permitted to grant or withhold their own Money occa&s;ionally, as their Delegates may deem to be mo&s;t expedient, when Matters are maturely debated among them. From the&s;e weighty Con&s;iderations, the Money|granting Repre&s;entatives of the People admit of no Direction from the higher Branches of the Le|gi&s;lature. They are cho&s;en and relied on by the Freemen of England; &s;o ju&s;tly contend they ought to promote and guard their rea&s;onable Inte|re&s;t, and therefore claim the &s;ole Right of forming Money Bills; but as this &s;ound Rea&s;oning holds good for their taxing the Inhabitants of that King|dom, it ab&s;olutely forbids their giving away our Money, who neither choo&s;e, know, nor have any Rea&s;on to tru&s;t a Majority of them; and clearly &s;hews we &s;hould be taxed by Per&s;ons of our own choo&s;ing, whom we confide in for that great Pur|po&s;e, among other occa&s;ional Requi&s;ites of Con|&s;equence.</P>

<P>The&s;e are undeniable Conclu&s;ions; &s;o let us &s;trive heroickly to &s;ave our ine&s;timable Privileges, and dutifully honour a Briti&s;h Prerogative. Let a con|&s;titutional Relation between Prince and Subjects, their Re&s;pective Rights, and mutual Obligations be ever inviolably pre&s;erved; for Princes may as rea&s;onably expect Favour from us, as we can ex|pect it from them, and never &s;hould be Slaves to our Avarice, Ambition or Caprice, while we are befriended by their Admini&s;tration. Let us render to Ce&s;ar all that &s;hould be Ce&s;ar's, and be ruled by him with a noble Sovereign Fidelity. Let us grant Money expediently, according to our Cir|cum&s;tances and Occa&s;ions, and the Crown advan|tagiou&s;ly apply it.</P>
<P>But e'er I take my Leave of this great Topick, I mu&s;t yet detect a Subterfuge relative to it; for our alarmingly overborne Colonies, according to our Enemies Preten&s;ion, are as much repre&s;ented in the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, and may be as ju&s;tly tax|ed by it, as Engli&s;h Bodies corporate without legal Delegates. Thus our lordly Antagoni&s;ts argue; and this fine Time &s;erving Pretence is intirely founded on Fal&s;hood, however plau&s;ible it may &s;eem to weak or prejudiced Minds; for notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome Engli&s;h Bodies corporate, which are far from being incon&s;iderable, have no Power to &s;end Delegates to Parliament, yet all the &s;pecial Intere&s;ts of &s;uch little common Wealths, which are but particular Sources of a national Utility, are open|ly before the Commons of that Kingdom; and though &s;uch private Communities are not repre|&s;ented
<PB N="29" REF="011073_0028_0F854B216435F948">
as incorporated Bodies, they are all directly repre&s;ented by the Knights of Shires, and &s;ome of them al&s;o, by the Delegates of Cities or Boroughs they vote for, and may likewi&s;e promote the Elec|tion of other Favourites greatly, and even have &s;ome of their own Members elected, for their re|&s;pective Counties, adjacent, or di&s;tant Boroughs. The&s;e inconte&s;table Truths &s;hew a wide Difference between &s;uch Bodies Corporate and our Colonies; and without &s;uch great Privileges, the former might even have a great Intere&s;t in Parliament, from an intimate Corre&s;pondence, and perhaps a more beneficial Connection with many of its Mem|bers, which far di&s;tant Americans could not procure.</P>
<P>Could &s;uch political Bodies not vote for either City or Borough Repre&s;entatives, nor have any of their own Members elected; and could no ad|vantagious Attachments flow from their Vicinity; yet, as all their Voters may choo&s;e County Dele|gates, they are even thus as fully repre&s;ented, as a great Part of the Briti&s;h Freeholders, in&s;tead of being in our Condition, and in every much contro|verted Election, but very few more than half the Voters them&s;elves may be repre&s;ented by Per&s;ons of their own choo&s;ing; and as a Majority of Elec|tors and Non-Electors may probably be of the &s;ame Opinion, from the great Intermixture of them&s;elves and Affairs, even the latter, as well as the former, may frequently be repre&s;ented by Men they approve.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e are re&s;pectably Conclu&s;ions about this important and much wre&s;ted Subject; and when Voters are even divided into the mo&s;t &s;tre|nuous Parties, they may &s;till have their joint Inte|re&s;t principally in View, and only differ in Opinion about the propere&s;t Advocates for it; and &s;hould Prejudice even blind each Party, or either of them,

and cau&s;e their principal Intentions to be ever &s;o oppo&s;ite, yet, as I have clearly evinced, the Com|mons cannot &s;erve their Con&s;tituents faithfully without favouring their warme&s;t Opponents in a &s;imilar Manner, from the great Affinity and Con|nection of their Intere&s;ts. Thus the various In|tere&s;ts at Home are regularly promoted, by Men intimately acquainted with them all, and as &s;peci|al Sources of a national Emolument; but were the &s;ame Gentlemen ever &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed to favour us, they could not po&s;&s;ibly repre&s;ent or befriend us effectually, for Want of proper Ideas of our chang|ing Affairs, and can therefore never tax us with a con&s;titutional Equity, either as Briti&s;h Non-Elec|tors, or any Kind of incorporated Bodies at Home. Were they even unanimou&s;ly our &s;incere Friends, which &s;urely they are not at pre&s;ent, we could not be virtually repre&s;ented by &s;uch Strangers; nor may any Per&s;on contend for &s;uch a Repre&s;entation, or the fictitious Right founded upon it, without a very weak Head, or a very bad Heart, and a palpable Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t needs appear now to be very demon&s;tra|ble at lea&s;t, and I think to be already briefly de|mon&s;trated, that we neither are virtually repre&s;ent|ed in Parliament, nor can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o repre&s;ent|ed at pre&s;ent; and that we may even tax England as ju&s;tly as &s;he can tax us, but not enforce arbitra|ry Impo&s;itions with an equal Power. Could that Idol, called Briti&s;h Freedom, even po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t a|mong us, while our Intere&s;t is di&s;po&s;ed of by Fo|reigners, without our Con&s;ent, and repugnant to our Will, or while we are re&s;trained from manu|facturing provincial Commodities, for our own U&s;e at lea&s;t, it would hardly be worth adoring and boa&s;ting of, according to the immemorial Cu&s;tom of Engli&s;hmen. Without oppre&s;&s;ive Taxations, the Scourges of Prohibition may drive us into
<PB N="31" REF="011073_0030_0F854B22E1338AD0">
Bondage, into ab&s;olute Bondage; but I mu&s;t leave the latter to other Writers, and clo&s;e my pre&s;ent Arguments again&s;t the former by only ju&s;t ob&s;erv|ing farther, that we &s;hould be viewed as genuine Branches of the Briti&s;h Family, and that the adja|cent People of Ireland, a conquered Country, might be much better repre&s;ented by Engli&s;h Se|nators, and more equitably taxed by them, than far di&s;tant Americans can po&s;&s;ibly be, unle&s;s the awfully different Sounds of <HI>Iri&s;h Parliament,</HI> and <HI>American A&s;&s;emblies</HI> intirely change the Nature of &s;uch Things; and yet I pre&s;ume they will hardly tax that contigious Kingdom, however over-borne Coloni&s;ts, already a much more numerous People, may be tyrannically forced to groan under arbitra|ry Burthens.</P>
<P>I have now drawn this much perverted Subject out of Darkne&s;s, and I think our mo&s;t &s;anguine Adver&s;aries, after reading my Ob&s;ervations upon it, can no more pre&s;ume to &s;ay, we are virtually repre&s;ented in England, and may be ju&s;tly taxed by her. Their virtual Repre&s;entation is now damn|ed with an argumentative Authority, much too powerful for all the Sanctions of Sophi&s;try, which no doubt was our greate&s;t one Thing needful from the Beginning; for all their Batteries again&s;t our Freedom, are erected upon it, and our mo&s;t con|fident Denials could never refute their confident A&s;&s;ertions, nor &s;hew the wide Difference between us and Briti&s;h Non-Electors, or Engli&s;h Bodies corporate, without &s;pecial Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>When their pretended virtual Repre&s;entation, and the nominal Right leaning upon it, are utter|ly annihilated by invincible Arguments, a naked Inju&s;tice only may en&s;lave us, which the wor&s;t of our imperial Senators will hardly avow; and yet many of them may be as deaf to Remon&s;trances again&s;t a Parliamentary De&s;poti&s;m, while they have
<PB N="32" REF="011073_0031_0F854B23B9892810">
any Colour of Right to favour it, as over-reaching Bargainers are to moral Rea&s;onings, that would per&s;uade them to annul their Kind of fair Con|tracts, and to forego Advantages they may legal|ly retain. While Innovators have an ideal Right, and colourable Intention, they always encroach as upright Men; and pungent Arguments may drive them gradually to Tyranny, under the Name of abu&s;ive Invectives, in&s;tead of exciting them to grant Redre&s;s. Warm moral Complaints again&s;t legal Preten&s;ions, or injurious Proceedings found|ed upon them, may &s;oon rai&s;e national Storms of a fatal Con&s;equence. Very lofty &s;uper&s;tructures without a good Foundation are more likely to cru&s;h than favour their Inhabitants, e&s;pecially in tempe&s;tuous Sea&s;ons; and I think the pre&s;ent A|&s;pect of our imperial Planets, does not portend very temporate Weather.</P>
<P>While Parliamentary Encroachments are neatly dre&s;&s;ed, with the Shadows of Right, and a plau&s;i|ble Purpo&s;e, they will ever be called ju&s;t and ex|pedient Exertions of Power; and Truth very warmly uttered again&s;t them, will not only be ex|ploded as &s;editious Calumny, but u&s;urping legi&s;la|tive Bigots will even think often it is &s;o, while they &s;eem to have any con&s;titutional Authority; and that Pretext mu&s;t be entirely taken from them e'er free Remon&s;trances effectually prevail, howe|ver &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oothing Petitions may now and then prove. Had we not many imperious Grenvils to &s;truggle with, one or a few of them could not hurt us; and &s;uch lordly Gentlemen, may kindly vouch&s;afe to grant humble Petitions, properly a|dapted to their &s;uppo&s;ed Excellency, but never can brook cutting Remon&s;trances again&s;t their mo&s;t injurious Tran&s;actions, while the lea&s;t Shew of Right waits upon them; &s;o we &s;hould entirely de|prive them of &s;uch Pleas, or &s;eem to give up our
<PB N="33" REF="011073_0032_0F854B246D457658">
Rights, and cringingly implore Favour, in&s;tead of boldly demanding Ju&s;tice by irritating Remon|&s;trances and provoking moral Complaints. While &s;uch Arrogators can maintain a pretended Right, they will nobly re&s;ent abu&s;ive Truth, and be ve|ry highly incen&s;ed at moral Slander. I am well acquainted with &s;uch nobly inglorious Tempers, and have purcha&s;ed my Ideas of them, at a very con&s;iderable Expence.</P>
<P>No doubt many Engli&s;h Senators have another Kind of Greatne&s;s, and gallantly &s;uppre&s;s Excite|ments to an ignoble Loftine&s;s of Mind; but we know not how many of them are well di&s;po&s;ed, as mo&s;t of them are utter Strangers, nor can we tell who may &s;ucceed them; &s;o if I have not already &s;hewn, inconte&s;tably &s;hewn, we are not repre&s;ent|ed in Parliament at all, I hope others will improve my Arguments on that Subject, or advance better on a new Foundation, if that may be done, and demon&s;trate it even &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly, that none may pre&s;ume to di&s;pute it. I think it is rendered indi&s;putable already; and &s;hould I greatly over va|lue my own Arguments, according to the Cu&s;tom of petty Scribblers, yet &s;urely it is capable of &s;uch a Demon&s;tration, and our threatned Welfare loud|ly calls for it.</P>
<P>Should the People of France, or any ab&s;olute Monarchy, argue ever &s;o ju&s;tly and wi&s;ely in fa|vour of Freedom, I &s;uppo&s;e their &s;tronge&s;t moral Rea&s;onings would hardly procure the wanted Ble&s;s|ing, but might probably draw new Evils upon them, if per&s;everingly and ardently advanced, much &s;ooner than weaker and le&s;s pungent Arguments; and perhaps no ab&s;olute Monarch is fonder of his un|limited Prerogative, than many Briti&s;h Commons now are; and others may be hereafter of an unli|mited Money-rai&s;ing Power; &s;o of Cour&s;e we mu&s;t clearly &s;hew their taxing Power is bounded,
<PB N="34" REF="011073_0033_0F854B25348CE950">
and that it does not extend to the Colonies, before our endangered Freedom can ever be &s;ecure, how|ever their De&s;igns may be repre&s;&s;ed a while. Encroachments proceed &s;lowly, while Shame or Fear can &s;tem them, but may gradually advance till their potent and enraged Authors, are rendered almo&s;t in&s;u&s;ceptible of either; and there mu&s;t be a very great Change of Times indeed, e're moral Rea&s;onings drive Men from an idolized con&s;tituti|onal Right, or any darling Claim that is deemed to be one; nor will parliamentary Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, wed|ed to idle Notions, add here le&s;s fondly to a favou|rite ideal Right, than to one the mo&s;t firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, until they are properly undeceived by forcible Exhibitions; and e're wilfully fal&s;e Preten|&s;ions to Right are openly detected, their immoral Authors will hardly recede from them, which &s;uf|ficiently ju&s;tifies my pre&s;ent Conclu&s;ions, let our Grievances proceed from Mi&s;take or De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Moral Arguments, indeed, &s;hould always be ho|noured by moral Agents that have Power to weigh them, but very rarely &s;ucceed when oppo&s;|ed to an ideal or pretended Right; and arrogating Encroachers will not only call Ab&s;urdity Rea&s;on, but, through an artificial Blindne&s;s, often deem it to be &s;o while it can be prettily cloathed with a plau&s;ibly gratifying Sophi&s;try; &s;o their a&s;&s;umed Right mu&s;t be utterly effaced before our Freedom can po&s;&s;ibly attend us in Safety, as Subjects to the Crown of Great-Britain; and the Support of one imperial Government is enough for England and her Colonies. A notional Right is a dangerous Weapon in the Hand of Oppre&s;&s;ive Power; and arbitrary Impo&s;itions upon us, while they have &s;uch a Foundation to befriend them, mu&s;t be glar|ingly injurious e're Strangers to our Circum&s;tances, highly prejudiced in their Favour, and much pro|voked by our galling Complaints again&s;t them,
<PB N="35" REF="011073_0034_0F854B25EFEFE190">
will even think them unju&s;t or unrea&s;onable, &s;o long as they are colourably applied; and &s;hould Re|dre&s;s abate our pre&s;ent Alarms, yet our Danger mu&s;t exi&s;t perpetually, while the Parliament can &s;upport its a&s;&s;uming Right of taxing us. Abated Flames may &s;oon revive through accidental Bla&s;ts when much Fuel is near them, and even rage more fiercely than ever; &s;o let our invaded Rights be explicitly a&s;certained before we have done, for they &s;hould now be ab&s;olutely fixed, as parliamen|tary Infringements may &s;hew us.</P>
<P>We labour already under more Grievances than the Stamp-Tax, which are far from being incon&s;idera|ble, and it is Time to know our Condition certain|ly; for we &s;hould not always wander in Darkne&s;s about a Matter of &s;uch va&s;t Importance, but have proper Limits fixed between us and the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, which never can be done con&s;titution|ally by a parliamentary Bill of Rights we had no Share in. As no Law can affect Briti&s;h Freemen without their Con&s;ent, it will be hard to &s;hew how we can be con&s;titutionally affected by any parlia|mentary Bill of Rights we never a&s;&s;ented to, and without &s;uch arbitrary Proceedings, had we but an American Parliament, the momentous Relation be|tween England and her Colonies might naturally induce their two great Legi&s;latures to proceed har|moniou&s;ly, and to &s;ecure a parental Precedency to our Mother Country, without Oppre&s;&s;ion, lordly Treatment, Complaints or Di&s;affection.</P>
<P>Let us draw Good out of evil Intentions, get our Rights clearly a&s;certained, and take every Handle from our Enemies; for when national En|croachments are brought into Being, they will hardly peri&s;h for Want of Sub&s;i&s;tence, while a pre|tended Right, and colourable Purpo&s;e may feed them, however they may be &s;tunted a while. A parliamentary De&s;poti&s;m may occa&s;ionally forbear
<PB N="36" REF="011073_0035_0F854B26A1258110">
to act offen&s;ively, while it is even defended by the &s;tronge&s;t Fortification and Garri&s;on on Earth; but we mu&s;t deprive it intirely of all Kinds of Sub&s;i&s;t|ence, that has any Appearance of con&s;titutional Provi&s;ion, before it will ever &s;urrender to our Plea|&s;ure, how loudly &s;oever our Heralds may &s;ummon it; and we can hardly force it otherwi&s;e to Sub|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>While the Parliament has Recour&s;e to arbitrary Bills of Right, it will hardly lay down an a&s;&s;umed Power again&s;t us it may colourably retain; for &s;urely French Edicts may operate again&s;t us as con|&s;titutionally as any arbitrary Briti&s;h Statute what|ever; &s;o let Order be drawn out of Confu&s;ion, and proper Boundaries be openly fixed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble between Engli&s;h Privileges and ours. A Bill of Right for Great-Britain may be regularly pro|po&s;ed in Parliament, as the Rights of that Nation are &s;olely divided between the King and People of it, and as no Bill can pa&s;s without the A&s;&s;ent of both Parties; and had we a Negative in the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, &s;uch Laws might con&s;titutionally ex|tend to us al&s;o, becau&s;e they could have no Force without our Concurrence; but as Matters are re|pugnantly circum&s;tanced, nothing can be more ar|bitrary than &s;uch Acts of Parliament, &s;o far as they affect the Colonies. This Doctrine may great|ly alarm our mo&s;t &s;oaring Enemies, that dream as wildly of a parliamentary Omnipotence, as Pa|pi&s;ts do of their Church's Infallibility; but it &s;urely proceeds from a con&s;titutional Pen, that hates Petulancy, as well as Encroachments; and &s;hould the Parliament have a Right to fix Limits between England and us, independent of our A&s;|&s;ent, it may as ju&s;tly alter &s;uch Limits at Plea&s;ure, and no French Monarch can be more ab&s;olute; &s;o let the Rights of each Party be con&s;titutionally a&s;|certained before our important Debates &s;ub&s;ide,
<PB N="37" REF="011073_0036_0F854B2767FDCEE8">
that invigorating Harmony may &s;trengthen the Em|pire, and inte&s;tine Feuds enervate it no more. The grand Di&s;pute is warmly commenced, and let it be pro&s;ecuted to a &s;overeign Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e Hints &s;hould be honoured by En|gli&s;h Encroachers, and American Writers again&s;t them, for they may be very u&s;eful to the latter, &s;o far as they turn the former and their fir&s;t Depen|dants in&s;ide out. I have been very explicit indeed, and we never &s;hould trifle in alarming Danger, when even a very formidable Power, we relied on for Protection, threatens us and our Po&s;terity with perpetual Chains.</P>
<P>Briti&s;h Commons pretend to defend the Rights of the Subject, as faithful and noble con&s;titutional Guardians; but I fear a great Number of them, after every ju&s;t Palliation in their Favour threw ours very ingloriou&s;ly away, when they fondly prepared the Stamp-Act for the royal A&s;&s;ent, and in other con&s;iderable In&s;tances al&s;o, which I mu&s;t wave at pre&s;ent; and we may well be as free in Remon&s;trances, that have argumentative Sanctions, as they have been in Attempts to en&s;lave us. They &s;hould not force us to complain, and then condemn us for complaining, for we had rather ble&s;s them as Friends, than cur&s;e them as Ene|mies; and &s;hould they have been deceived through Inclination, Precipitancy, and fal&s;e Shews of Right, we ought to render their &s;hocking Mi&s;take appa|rent, and the horrid Fruits of it dete&s;table, that we may obtain Redre&s;s, and prevent the like for the Future.</P>
<P>For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, I think my opene&s;t Language highly expedient, and con&s;equently very ju&s;tifia|ble; but Writers, much heated by great Provoca|tions, are often prejudiced in Favour of their cen|&s;uring Freedom, and &s;hould I ever be made con|&s;cious of &s;uch an Error, I am willing to make pub|lick
<PB N="38" REF="011073_0037_0F854B282C598018">
and adequate Reparation; for it is noble to make Satisfaction for known Injuries of any Kind, and Meanne&s;s only may excite Men to defend them, as I would fain per&s;uade our Superiors and others to believe. But while we inveigh freely again&s;t the a&s;&s;uming Hou&s;e of Commons, for the arbitrary Proceedings of a Majority, let us vir|tuou&s;ly remember &s;ome brave Men, a prai&s;e-wor|thy Minority, in that arrogating and &s;ometimes giddy A&s;&s;embly, which &s;corned temporizing Pur|&s;uits, and who&s;e laudable Efforts, though fruitle&s;s, call loudly for our grateful Acknowledgement and E&s;teem. When we complain the mo&s;t warmly of injurious Numbers, and the invincible Force of parliamentary Yeas again&s;t us, let us treat &s;uch over-borne Worthies with a lively Re&s;pect that is evidently due to their Merit.</P>
<P>Let &s;uitable Petitions humbly &s;ue for the favourable Influence of the Crown, and &s;pirited Remon&s;trances, from the Pre&s;s or otherwi&s;e, ful|ly evince our threatned con&s;titutional Rights, and clearly detect the groundle&s;s Claim of our a&s;&s;uming Fellow-Subjects again&s;t them, which &s;olid Arguments only may effect. Let us proceed in this Manner till our Grievances are removed, and our con&s;titutional Privileges firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, if that may be done. We may thus draw every true Briton to our Intere&s;t, leave our per&s;evering Enemies no Colour of an Excu&s;e, convert the fall|ing out of Friends to the Advancement of their Friend&s;hip, and perhaps timely convince our lofti|e&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ors, we are not meer Bea&s;ts of Burthen, created for their Service, but the Fellow-Creatures, and Fellow-Subjects of &s;uch great Men.</P>
<P>When we want Favours from the Parliament, and when it proceeds according to the genuine Dignity of a Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, let us humbly pre&s;ent our Petitions, and treat it with a dutiful Reverence, as our augu&s;t imperial Senate, but let
<PB N="39" REF="011073_0038_0F854B28E1ADA4A0">
us not flatter the Vanity, nor feed the Errors of imperious Fellow-Subjects, in the mo&s;t exalted Stations, that want oppre&s;&s;ively to lord it over us; for much le&s;s injurious Proceedings than we com|plain of, would even render a German Diet utter|ly unworthy of Honour. If Men are not really and e&s;&s;entially great, a lofty Situation cannot po&s;&s;ibly make them &s;o; and &s;prightly Dwarfs may not only climb very high, but even &s;olace greatly, and &s;hine bright|ly with Pageantry, on a very &s;oaring Eminence, when very great Men are in Trouble, and Ob&s;cu|rity at the Bottom of it; &s;o if our Freedom mu&s;t fall a Victim to potent Ambition, let it die ho|nourably, but not through our own Pertne&s;s, Pre|cipitancy, and fal&s;e Ideas of Honour. Should dreadful Times even forbid us to &s;peak Truth free|ly, let us not meanly utter Fal&s;ehood, but guard our Virtue with a &s;ullen Integrity, that nobly di&s;|dains to extend a Time-&s;erving Adulation, and never rail at Men for holding great Offices, but treat good Officers with a proper Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Indeed the greate&s;t frail Men are but fallible Creatures, and liable to plau&s;ibly mi&s;chievous Er|rors, but never can ignobly defend them when ful|ly di&s;clo&s;ed, for moral Eminence only is real Great|ne&s;s, &s;o if our Superiors have wandered after a colourable Deception, adapted to their Inclination, let them be now open to Conviction, as truly ho|nourable Men, and henceforth merit and obtain a re&s;pectful Submi&s;&s;ion, according to my ardent De&s;ire; but let us not meanly &s;ooth them, when we cannot honour them &s;incerely. Their Ability of Cour&s;e is greater than ours, as they have great|er Opportunities of Improvement; but our Argu|ments on this Subject, are no doubt generally much &s;uperior to theirs, and as &s;uch &s;hould be ho|noured by the greate&s;t of them, for they have not only con&s;trained us to ponder maturely, but &s;ound
<PB N="40" REF="011073_0039_0F854B29C0AF81B0">
Rea&s;oning does not &s;uit their Purpo&s;e, as Truth is intirely on our Side the Que&s;tion. As our Argu|ments have a &s;olid Foundation, an oppo&s;ite Sophi|&s;try can but have a fictitious one, and Nece&s;&s;ity is often the Mother of important Con&s;iderations, as well as other u&s;eful Inventions; and none truly great may immorally de&s;pi&s;e her argumentative Productions, when they openly call for Redre&s;s of Grievances, however ba&s;e Flattery may abu&s;e their Contemners.</P>
<P>I have dealt very plainly with our potent Di&s;|turbers, for I cannot be properly regarded with|out being clearly under&s;tood; and Compliments are no proper Return to male Treatment, nor do Opulence and Greatne&s;s always a&s;&s;ociate as friendly Companions, but are often great Strangers and Op|ponents to each other, as every Propriator of both, as well as Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the latter only, will freely confe&s;s in&s;tead of re&s;enting; and though the Stamp|Act obtained the Royal A&s;&s;ent, after &s;oaring En|gli&s;h Money-granters prepared it for that Purpo&s;e, yet &s;ome of my preceding Ob&s;ervations, as well as the Dignity of Monarchs, may &s;hew why the Crown &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed by Petition, while we freely explode their lordly Proceeding. They have already &s;purned at our humble Petitions; and now let us prudently re&s;ent their Di&s;dain, without any Kind of &s;editious or abu&s;ive Invectives, for no vir|tuous Loyali&s;ts can be plea&s;ed with the latter, when he coolly reflects upon them; and the former mu&s;t be approved by every real Friend of Briti&s;h Liber|ty, when it and the Cau&s;e of it are pre&s;ented to his Mind; for no true Briton, without Abhorrence, can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee Engli&s;h Subjects, even the remot|e&s;t Branches of them cruelly deprived of vital Freedom, and tyrannically buried alive in De&s;|poti&s;m.</P>

<P>I HAVE doubtle&s;s proved in my former E&s;&s;ay, among other Things of Importance, that En|gland cannot tax Americans con&s;titutionally, nor even without a manife&s;t Violation of a national Faith, in a Matter of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence; and I hope now to &s;hew her late Overbearings a|gain&s;t us were as far di&s;tant from true Policy as good Morals, which, indeed, in proce&s;s of Time, will ever be found to be in&s;eperably united.</P>
<P>As correct Maps have not yet di&s;clo&s;ed the Cer|tainly, let us take it for granted at pre&s;ent, that Briti&s;h Dominions, on the Continent of North-A|merica, are now equal to a Square of a Thou&s;and Miles, and then maturely con&s;ider what Colonies are wanted, and what a va&s;t Number of People may be &s;upported, and very advantageou&s;ly em|ployed, in that widely extended Empire. I think we have a rea&s;onable Hypothe&s;is before us; and &s;uch a prodigious Tract of Ground contains a Milli|on &s;quare Miles, or &s;ix Hundred and forty Milli|on Acres of Land, which would even be &s;ixteen Acres for each Individual, when equally divided among forty Million Inhabitants; and it will &s;ure|ly follow of Con&s;equence, that a truly political Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature can never treat People oppre&s;|&s;ively, haughtily, or even coolly, which are mo&s;t likely to forward the Settlement of it.</P>
<P>That exten&s;ive Territority we are now imper|fectly &s;urveying, is, perhaps, more than twelve times the Area of England and Wales, and would probably contain more than a hundred Million In|habitants, if crouded with People like them Countries; &s;o two Fifths of that va&s;t Number, or the forty Million I have a&s;&s;ined it to, would hardly overload it with Re&s;idents; for which
<PB N="42" REF="011073_0041_0F854B2B2C98C368">
weighty Rea&s;on, its pre&s;ent blooming Colonies &s;hould not be ra&s;hly &s;courged, but even very kind|ly treated, to induce proper Numbers to fill it up &s;peedily. They ought to be tenderly guarded by a jealous Love, that valuable Fruits may proceed timely, and even abundantly, from their very pro|mi&s;ing Blo&s;&s;oms, which the Storms of a jealous Tyranny would bla&s;t and prevent. Loyal Subjects can but poorly brook &s;uch injurious Tempe&s;ts, from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s they are not de&s;erved.</P>
<P>We have indeed Mountains, barren De&s;erts, Mora&s;&s;es and Waters, like other wide Empires on this terraqueous Globe; but our external Barrens, like &s;uch in other Places, as well as our fine Bays, Rivers and Lakes, may be internally fruitful, em|ploy a great Number of People, and not only be|&s;tow many Nece&s;&s;aries, but even much Wealth al|&s;o upon the Empire. The&s;e are natural, and therefore probable Conclu&s;ions; and as our im|provable Wilds want many new Colonies, can that important End po&s;&s;ibly be promoted by violently breaking down our Con&s;titutional Fences, that arbitrary Brutes of Prey may rudely &s;poil tho&s;e al|ready planted? Do not the Laws of true Policy, and even of true common Sen&s;e it&s;elf, as well as the Laws of common Ju&s;tice, and our excellent Con&s;titution, ab&s;olutely prohibit the prepo&s;terous Mea&s;ures alluded to? Can extending bad Treat|ment to good old Tenants induce other Hu&s;band|men to &s;truggle with many Hard&s;hips in &s;ettling difficult new Tenements for &s;uch Landlords?</P>
<P>When Briti&s;h Commons ra&s;hly extort &s;uch Que|ries, they could not po&s;&s;ibly be directed by true Policy, admit it could even exi&s;t in Oppo&s;ition to a con&s;titutional Ju&s;tice; and as they have viewed our large Continent it&s;elf but very imperfectly, at &s;o great a Di&s;tance, they can hardly properly re|pre&s;ent our little thriving Nur&s;eries upon it, which

change con&s;iderably every growing Sea&s;on, nor &s;ee clearly what trimming and other Improvements they &s;ucce&s;&s;ively want; for great Mountains are more vi&s;ible afar off than &s;mall artificial Mounts can be, and are even often di&s;covered when many of their own con&s;iderable Eminences and Cavities are not di&s;tingui&s;hable at all. While Men cannot &s;ee or overlook very great Things, they never can have clear Ideas of much &s;maller Matters con|nected with them; and potent Strangers may in|deed &s;end Force enough to plunder us, under a Colour of Law or otherwi&s;e, but never can repre|&s;ent us virtually, when they neither can clearly &s;ee us, our little changing Affairs, nor even the new World it&s;elf we live in. Before &s;uch Men virtual|ly repre&s;ent us, the common Signification of &s;uch Words mu&s;t be rever&s;ed.</P>
<P>After warmly encountering and partly &s;ubduing rude Fore&s;ts, dangerous Serpents, wild Bea&s;ts, and wor&s;e Savages, we now begin to make &s;ome Fi|gure on our Part of the Globe; and I &s;uppo&s;e it will hardly be denied, that &s;ome of our fir&s;t Settle|ments lately purcha&s;ed a Peace for Great-Britain, and that we chearfully a&s;&s;i&s;ted her afterwards in &s;tretching out this va&s;t Empire to its pre&s;ent ex|ten&s;ive Dimen&s;ions; and yet, after all our Loyal|ty and Bravery, added to the Importance of our Trade, what alarming Returns does &s;he make us! Do we de&s;erve that hard Treatment we meet with? May either Ju&s;tice or Wi&s;dom extent it? Can it even po&s;&s;ibly nouri&s;h our Loyalty or Affiance? Are galling Chains our righteous De&s;ert? May they and our extorted Complaints favour new Set|tlements, and help England to exchange our u&s;e|le&s;s Trees for u&s;eful Colonies of People?

Of Cour&s;e the Parliament has been lulled a&s;leep, and the Conduct complained of proceeded from a Dream, or our ancient lawgiving Mother, which has been deemed rigidly virtuous, and exceedingly wi&s;e, wants to gratify imperious Lu&s;t very wan|tonly, impoliticly, and even very unnaturally in her advanced Years, at the great Expence or Ruin of her legitimate Offspring, and hitherto dutiful Chil|dren. Alas! our Pro&s;pects are very gloomy indeed; and yet let us not cheri&s;h De&s;pair or Aver&s;ion, but even hope for the be&s;t, while we can prudently cheri&s;h buoying Expectations; for I would fain believe our pre&s;ent Grievances, how wilful &s;oever they may &s;ometimes appear, mu&s;t needs be the Effect of our Mother's &s;lumbering Delu&s;ions, and will &s;traight be removed when the old Empre&s;s awaketh. A virtuous Matron may have lacivious Dreams, and dete&s;t their Excitments when &s;he can deliberate freely; and even tender dreaming Pa|rents may receive bad Impre&s;&s;ions again&s;t a hopeful Progeny, yet greatly abhor them when truly deli|neated by Rea&s;on.

<P>But can our imperial Mother cruelly re&s;ent them, and enforce her arbitrary Impo&s;itions by a cau&s;ele&s;s Vengeance! can &s;he be &s;o greatly dege|nerated, &s;acrifice her Honour &s;o ignobly, pro&s;ti|tute her Power &s;o ba&s;ely, or even po&s;&s;ibly keep our Complaints alive, after our importunate Clamours awake her, and excite her to ponder maturely!

This will hardly be di&s;puted by unprejudiced Men of Un|der&s;tanding, for I think it may even be clearly demon&s;trated, by &s;ound common Sen&s;e it&s;elf, that true Briti&s;h Policy can neither curtail our Freedom, nor cramp our Trade; but guard the former, and promote the latter, which &s;hould not only favour the expeditious Settlement of new Plantations, and that perhaps very greatly indeed, but im|power us to deal much more freely at Home, than our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances will by any Means admit of; and al&s;o in&s;pire us with a noble Re&s;o|lution of defending a Briti&s;h Glory and Utility, at the Expence of our Lives and Fortunes oc|ca&s;ionally; which precious Fruits never can pro|ceed from arbitrary Scourgings.</P>
<P>But to wave a raging Jealou&s;y and Di&s;&s;affection, and all their de&s;tructive Con&s;equences, which are &s;urely the mo&s;t fiendi&s;h Offspring of Oppre&s;&s;ion; we yearly want more Briti&s;h Goods con&s;iderably than our Exports to that Nation can purcha&s;e; and were but proper Markets opened for all the re&s;t of our vendible Commodities, we could traffick more and more with our Mother Country, and throw more and more Ca&s;h into her Coffers &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, while a true Briti&s;h Policy, a con&s;titutional Ju&s;tice, and a &s;overeign Amity &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us; nor would any Thing more naturally facilitate the Settlement of new Colonies, than cau&s;ing tho&s;e already planted to flouri&s;h greatly.

<P>I hope England will be a&s;hamed, afraid, of &s;uch mon&s;trous Proceedings, and even run &s;wiftly from them before their direful Con&s;equences make her &s;hudder; and the&s;e Expectations &s;eem well grounded, for admit &s;he is very much de|generated, which I would not fondly believe, yet as her late Encroachments are &s;o glaringly re|pugnant to her own Intere&s;t, as well as a con&s;ti|tutional Ju&s;tice, I think they proceeded of Cour&s;e from Delu&s;ion, and mu&s;t vani&s;h when it is re|moved.

The&s;e are buoying and charitable Hopes, and let us yet cheri&s;h them in Spite of our gloomy Appearances; for Hi&s;tory and Experience may a|bundantly &s;hew us, that many famous Men, in the wi&s;e&s;t Ages, have wildly dreamed, with their Eyes open, in Favour of one darling View or other.</P>

<P>I HAVE already clearly proved, according to my own Conception, that the Stamp-Act wounds the royal Prerogative deeply, and is equal|ly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Honour of the Crown, a national Faith and Affiance, a con&s;titutional Ju|&s;tice, the fundamental Law of Briti&s;h Taxations, and true political Wi&s;dom, which &s;hould abun|dantly excite moral Agents to damn &s;uch brood|ing Evils, and all their horrid Offspring; but as arbitrary Tempers are exceedingly fond of mi&s;|chievous Encroachments, I mu&s;t yet &s;trive to render them more dete&s;table, by farther expo&s;ing their vieled Deformity, which is far from being fully di&s;clo&s;ed at pre&s;ent, and will even be much &s;ecreted when I have done, &s;o let others di&s;play it effectually at length. Such rude Pu&s;hes at our Freedom are very alarming, when &s;eriou&s;ly viewed in any Light, how &s;portive &s;oever we may &s;ome|times decry them, in the mid&s;t of our fluctuating Ideas, when Hope alternately gets the better of Fear, but are mo&s;t &s;hocking when we con&s;ider where they came from, and that they actually pro|ceeded from its nominal Guardians.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="011073_0056_0F854B399037AC20">
If powerful Friends &s;tood firmly by us, we might &s;afely de&s;pi&s;e the ba&s;e De&s;igns of much weaker Enemies, but &s;hould be very circum&s;pect and gallant too, when potent nominal Friends join eagerly with open Foes to en&s;lave us; and that wicked Law which threatens to de&s;troy our Free|dom, was the amazing Draught of its nominal Protectors; of Men that pretend nobly to defend con&s;titutional Rights and Privileges, again&s;t both regal U&s;urpations and mini&s;terial Corruptions. That Briti&s;h Commons thus a&s;&s;ume the Guardian|&s;hip of the Subject, is even inconte&s;tably notori|ous; and yet now our famous nominal Guardians, through the Plentitude of their Money-rai&s;ing Power, would freely damn the con&s;titutional Li|berty of their American Fellow Subjects, an ig|nobly intail perpetual Slavery upon us! We are thus experimentally in&s;tructed, that great Preten|&s;ions have &s;ometimes but &s;mall Foundations, and are not always &s;upported by great Realities; but &s;urely &s;uch Gentlemen mu&s;t be &s;urpri&s;ingly deceiv|ed, or Briti&s;h Electors might find much better Delegates, if Old-England is not even inexpre&s;&s;i|bly degenerated. A genuine Briti&s;h Patrioti&s;m, immemorially lauded by the greate&s;t Men, can ne|ver be a partial Di&s;po&s;ition highly inglorious.</P>
<P>Were &s;uch arrogating Mortals our be&s;t Advo|cates and Guardians, and &s;hould they adhere to their pre&s;ent Intention, how wretched indeed would our Circum&s;tances be! we &s;hould thus be treated like the holy Author of Chri&s;tianity, who was &s;acrificed by the nominal Friends of the Me&s;|&s;iah; and who is &s;till betrayed to a faithle&s;s Con|tempt by nominal Chri&s;tians, even the greate&s;t of them, our lofty High Prie&s;ts them&s;elves; but let us be truly thankful, for our Condition is not quite &s;o gloomy, unle&s;s our wounded Grants from the Crown be intirely murdered at length, which

&s;hould, no Doubt, be in&s;tantly healed, and invi|olably honoured for the future. Our Provincial Legi&s;latures, however diminutively they may be &s;poken of, are not confined to trifling By-Laws, like Companies and Towns corporate, but even our Fortunes, Reputations and Lives are as much &s;ubjected to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Acts as tho&s;e belonging to the Inhabitants of England are to the Statutes of that Nation; &s;o we may well be &s;uffered to tax our&s;elves di&s;cretionally, according to our Circum|&s;tances and Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Under what Colour of Ju&s;tice may a very di|&s;tant Legi&s;lature, unacquainted with our Ability and Occa&s;ions, or rather the a&s;&s;uming Commons of England, deprive us of that great con&s;tituti|onal Privilege! Such Briti&s;h Patriots would be highly inflamed, indeed, if a Prince on that Throne illegally demanded our Money, and threatned to &s;courge us for Non-compliance be|cau&s;e that Kind of arbitrary Exactions, if not timely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, might &s;oon bury their own Freedom, as well as ours, in the yawning Grave of De&s;poti&s;m; but while their own Rights &s;eem to be out of Danger, they can fondly deprive us of ours, and authori&s;e the Servants of the Crown to plunder us boldly, under a Colour of Law. If &s;uch Proceedings are con&s;i&s;tent with true Honour or the genuine Dignity of a Briti&s;h Parliament, I have hitherto been greatly mi&s;taken; and &s;urely &s;uch Men are not faithful Guardians of a con&s;ti|tutional Freedom, which &s;hould be equally main|tained in every Part of the Empire, but partial Sticklers for the Freedom of their own I&s;land only.</P>
<P>How di&s;honourable are &s;uch Stretches of invert|ed Power, of Power that &s;hould nobly defend them momentous Rights it aims to de&s;troy! and how could the Intriegues of a few re&s;tle&s;s Enemies

make us dread &s;uch parliamentary Encroachments, ere we &s;aw them, even in a free-thinking Age, wherein Briti&s;h Liberty is merely idolized! How could we &s;urmi&s;e great Men, exceedingly tena|cious of their own Freedom, could ingloriou&s;ly wre&s;t ours from us, and thus run from the Dig|nity of a Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature! Should the Court ever remove to this Continent, how would Great|Britain like &s;uch male Treatment! And &s;hould our imperial Power thus change its Situation, would not Americans have as much Right then to a|bu&s;e it as their Engli&s;h fellow Subjects have now? In a State of Trial, Probationers mu&s;t have Temp|tations to various Kinds of Evil, but &s;hould a bad Mini&s;try direct the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lator, or a good Parliament controul its injurious De&s;igns! Strong Men may extend evil Treatment to their weaker Brethren, as Experience too often evinces, but &s;trong Virtue never can produce it, nor &s;trong Rea&s;oning ever defend it.</P>
<P>The Stamp-Tax is evidently a partial Impo&s;ition, and was it ever &s;o equitable in its own Nature, that could not po&s;&s;ibly ju&s;tify an Arbitrary Taxa|tion; and judicious Briti&s;h Commons, as &s;taunch Engli&s;h Patriots, would be greatly alarmed at de&s;|potic Exactions from the Throne, that were ever &s;o rea&s;onable in them&s;elves, for they would be fully per&s;waded, as prudent fore &s;eeing Men, that De&s;poti&s;m, which began the mo&s;t plau&s;ibly, if not timely repelled, might gradually advance to intolerable Oppre&s;&s;ion; and can &s;ound Rea&s;on per&s;wade Engli&s;h Money-Granters it is better for us to be arbitrarily thumped by the Scepter and Mace al&s;o than by the former alone! When &s;uch Proceedings are placed in a proper Light, how cen&s;urable and defencele&s;s mu&s;t they appear? And what is the dreaded Power of a Royal Prerogative, when compared with &s;uch a boundle&s;s Money|rai&s;ing

We had better endure the Rod of an Ab&s;olute Mo|narch only, however we may dread it, than Ar|bitrary Scourgings from the Crown, and every Member of the Briti&s;h Parliament, or but even a majority of them al&s;o. We had better form a common Intere&s;t with all the Subjects of an Ab|&s;olute Monarchy, again&s;t the Power of a de&s;po|tical Ruler, than have ten Million fellow Subjects to help a Prince to en&s;lave us, and to keep us fa&s;t chained in Bondage.</P>
<P>The&s;e are very free Ob&s;ervations, and I &s;uppo&s;e our Adver&s;aries will call them Trea&s;on; but let impartial Readers &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, whether they or we are Enemies to the State, and that our Loy|alty cannot po&s;&s;ibly keep always alive, if it has no|thing but Poi&s;on to feed on.

<P>Should not Britain be a&s;hamed of her idle Clamours again&s;t us on Account of our late Irre|gularities, after &s;he had driven us forcibly into them; and &s;hould not our Lectures excite her to ponder maturely, to behave like her&s;elf for the future, to protect the Rights of all her Subjects impartially, and to &s;tigmatize criminal Innovators under their mo&s;t blazing Preten&s;ions of Patrioti&s;m?

<P>In our great monarchial Common-wealth, the Rights of the Crown and People &s;hould be equally guarded; for no Prince can &s;ufficiently befriend us without an adequate Power, nor the People be truly happy without Freedom and Security. The&s;e are well grounded Ob&s;ervations; and yet great Sticklers for parliamentary Privileges, frequently explode a whole&s;ome Power in others, that they may engro&s;s a noxious one them&s;elves; and per|haps many arbitrary Briti&s;h Taxers, if not Court Minions, could but poorly brook a beneficial Pre|rogative in the chief Magi&s;trate, while they are encroaching, even very injuriou&s;ly, as Senators; and doubtle&s;s the Court, if not cautiou&s;ly pre|vented, would &s;oon Monopolize all the Power of the free&s;t Nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e Conclu&s;ions are ju&s;tified by Hi&s;tory and Experience, and therefore &s;hould not our augu&s;t Hou&s;e of Lords, as a proper medium between the King and his People's Delegates, equally guard the Rights of Prince and Subject, and thus keep the publick Scales ever in good Order, that Common-wealth Affairs may be properly weighed in every Part of our exten&s;ive Empire?

<P>The greate&s;t of Men are &s;urely but fallible Creatures, and liable to injurious Mi&s;takes, even as exten&s;ive as their Influence, unle&s;s due Circum|&s;ection prevent it, for not only many famous Grecians and Romans of old, but even many ce|lebrated Politicians, Philo&s;ophers, and Divines of our more inlightned Day, have wandered &s;trangely after favourite Views into very gro&s;s Errors, and ra&s;hly wounding our Freedom is not the lea&s;t of them; for I will venture to prophe&s;y freely, with|out the illuminating Aid of a Prelate's Benedic|tion, that our roughly treated Colonies ere long, however they may be over-borne for a while, will either become &s;ome of the brighte&s;t Jewels in the Diadem of England, or pre&s;ent Crowns of Thorns to her Monarchs &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and I am as con|fident the greate&s;t Emolument of each Party ab|&s;olutely requires the former. The&s;e are now my deep-rooted Sentiments; and &s;hould the Opinion and Arguments of a Cottager, be ever &s;o loftily de&s;pi&s;ed by Proprietors of Palaces, yet Time will &s;urely determine, whether lordly Curtailors of our Rights, or prudent and loyal Remon&s;trants again&s;t them, are truly political and &s;ound Com|mon-wealth's Men.</P>

U&s;urpers, but our Allegiance and Advantage to Great-Britain, loudly demands that Protection, and yet it may &s;urely avail us but little, &s;hould our open Colonies be plundred, by England, which has more Power to hurt us than any other State; and as a Conflagration may actually proceed from a &s;mall Coal, or even a &s;ingle Spark of Fire, &s;o may Bondage, a compleat Bondage, if not timely prevented, from much &s;maller initial Encroach|ments than what we re&s;ent.

<P>A very Potent Nation may forcibly drive us into Slavery of one Kind or other, though per|haps not with the utmo&s;t Facility; but what Right hath England to demand our Allegiance, had we even no Grants at all from the Crown, without &s;e|curing to us the Privileges of Briti&s;h Subjects? Are we not Legitimate Children, have we not hitherto been Dutiful, is not a con&s;titutional Pa|trimony our ju&s;t Due, and may our Parents with|out Tyranny deprive us of it, and cruelly drive us into Bondage, with the Scourges of Ambition or Avarice! Have I not &s;hewn we are not Repre|&s;ented in Parliament at all, and can Engli&s;h Sub|jects be taxed ju&s;tly by any but their own Repre|&s;entatives?

Should not Briti&s;h Subjects po&s;&s;e&s;s Bri|ti&s;h Rights; and is not Freedom our Right by the &s;acred Law of Nature, as well as the Laws of our excellent Con&s;titution?

<P>The unaccountable Proceedings before us may be &s;omewhat palliated, but nothing can po&s;&s;ibly ju&s;tify them; for let us even &s;uppo&s;e the national Debt, the Expence of the late War, the Back|wardne&s;s of &s;ome wrangling Colonies in our pre|&s;ent loo&s;e Condition, and other Con&s;iderations of Con&s;equence, might naturally throw the Parliament into great Agitations about us, when its Spirits were much elated by a glorious Peace; yet when all this is granted, what could po&s;&s;ibly ju&s;tify an arbi|trary Impo&s;ition, before a con&s;titutional Demand had been made and perver&s;ely rejected! Arbitrary Stretches never can be expedient in peaceable Times, void of Emergencies, ere prudent con|&s;titutional Mea&s;ures have been utterly contemned; and of Cour&s;e the Stamp-Act was very unwar|rantably carried into Force, admit &s;uch de&s;potical Exertions of Power were &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary in very Alarming and dangerous Exigencies. Should our Superiors have had upright Intentions, they were very prematurely and ra&s;hly executed; but if they ran ha&s;tily after fal&s;e Ideas into &s;oothing Error, of a very awful Tendency, let them grant us Redre&s;s when their deadly Mi&s;take appears, and cautiou&s;ly pur&s;ue a con&s;titutional Ju&s;tice for the

<P>I know a &s;cheming Mini&s;try, and the Crown through it, are generally blamed for offen&s;ive Laws, as if the Parliament could do no Wrong, or was quite above Cen&s;ure; but whatever Re&s;pect may be intended by it, I think it but a very poor Compliment to the Lords and Commons of Eng|land, to be thus repre&s;ented as mere Cyphers, or pa&s;&s;ive Figures at be&s;t, occa&s;ionally u&s;ed by a few great Officers of State, and have therefore treated them with a much greater Re&s;pect, as free and vo|luntary Agents in a very important Station, that are morally accountable to the Publick for their Conduct, and even much more &s;o, than Men po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of but few Talents, a low Tru&s;t, and a &s;mall Influence can po&s;&s;ibly be. I cannot view or treat &s;uch great Men as meer inanimate Tools, taken up and u&s;ed at Plea&s;ure by State Artificers, for thus our famous Parliament would only be a pom|pous Shew, a fictitious Good, or a meer idolized Name, and even have le&s;s Power than impotent French Parliaments, while Briti&s;h Mini&s;ters had more than the Mini&s;try of France. I very much e&s;teem a good Mini&s;try, and hate the Proceedings of a bad one, but cannot think the Security of our rights leans upon the former, nor that the latter can rend them forcibly from us, or compel the Parliament to do it.</P>

<P>The&s;e Truths are even quite inconte&s;table; nor is it le&s;s indi&s;putable, that the injurious Proceed|ings of &s;uch great Men, may be as ju&s;tly exploded, as their Prai&s;e-worthy Tan&s;actions can be gratefully lauded. This &s;hould not only be acknowledged by the greate&s;t cen&s;ured Reader, but our &s;piritual Lords &s;hould even confe&s;s it in a very examplary Manner, and not treat me for &s;uch occa&s;ional Freedom, as haughty Jewi&s;h Doctors treated &s;he poor, &s;orrowful, unlearned, and freely reproving Author of Chri&s;tianity, for boldly promulgating that &s;acred Truth they pretend to defend; nor yet as Papi&s;ts treated inveighing Prote&s;tant Reformers; for great Profe&s;&s;ions can no more ju&s;tify the coun|ter Proceedings of dignified Prote&s;tants now, than they ju&s;tified the Crimes of Jewi&s;h and Popi&s;h Rabbins formerly.</P>
<P>As we are grieved by a parliamentary Di&s;poti&s;m, we &s;hould doubtle&s;s remon&s;trate directly again&s;t its injurious Supporters, how great &s;oever they ap|pear, and not content our&s;elves with branding the Conduct of an unju&s;t Mini&s;ter; for had not Mr. Granville many powerful Confederates, and was there but one over-bearing Mortal in England, he might ince&s;&s;antly plot again&s;t us in vain: And why &s;hould we flatter the Vanity of &s;uch an impe|rious Enemy, by fal&s;ly attributing our Grievances to his Influence?

Let our Com|plaints be directed into a proper Channel, for it is not a lordly Impotence, but the King, Lords and Commons of the Realm, that may drive our a|larmed Colonies farther into Thraldom, or re&s;tore and protect our Freedom.

<P>This explicit Rea&s;oning may be called abu&s;ive by incorrigible Delinquents, but it is &s;urely very far from being &s;o; and a moral Deformity &s;hould be occa&s;ionally expo&s;ed, when a natural one is compa&s;&s;ionately covered, for that is a proper Ob|ject of Di&s;grace, and this of Pity; and when the former is rendered dete&s;table, it may in&s;tantly be exchanged for Beauty, but the latter cannot be &s;o advantageou&s;ly bartered away. My Expre&s;&s;ions are very open on this provoking Occa&s;ion, and yet I would not wilfully offend any of my Superiors, nor even the lea&s;t or wor&s;t of the human Race; but as I treat indirect Proceedings and their Au|thors very freely, I expect my Ob&s;ervations will di&s;plea&s;e many in this pa&s;&s;ionate Age, but that is

Men view their pernicious Con|duct very partially whenever they do wrong through Mi&s;take or De&s;ign, and therefore reproving Free|dom &s;hould not only have a ju&s;t Foundation, but have its &s;olid Ba&s;is rendered apparent, el&s;e a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree of Re&s;entment in&s;tead of proper Convictions, and the moral Fruit of them will probably and almo&s;t certainly repay it.</P>
<P>Even very generous Unbelivers of a moral Di&s;|po&s;ition will be excited to cur&s;e rather than ble&s;s our ardent Divines, when &s;uch illuminated Wor|thies with a burning Zeal, angry Brow, glowing Cheeks, a prie&s;tly Authority, and great Anxiety for their Welfare, threaten Damnation for &s;lighting a very Sanctimonious prie&s;tly Jargon about our holy Sacraments, Grace, Election, Faith, Works, Law, Go&s;pel, Jews, Gentiles, Adam, Chri&s;t Man's Fall, our Impotence through it, Original Sin, imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Ju&s;tification, Sanc|tification, and Satisfaction through the Blood, Suf|ferings and Merits of the Me&s;&s;iah; for however &s;acred &s;uch Articles of Faith may be, yet what under&s;tanding Creature will cordially brook Threats of Ruin, or even but a &s;tern Reproof it&s;elf, for di&s;believing them, before he can &s;ee how they may be rationally a&s;&s;ented to, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly honoured?

<P>According to my Ideas, trying Symbols and Figures mu&s;t ever attend on a State of Divine Pro|bation, but can by no Means conceive how true Teachers can found Doctrines upon them, utterly repugnant to all the Plain Laws of God, and the Dictates of his Monitor in Probationers, and how wi&s;e moral Agents can piou&s;ly a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch Tenets or be damned for the contrary. I think al&s;o Bible Figures will be &s;oon defined, according to the Law of a rea&s;onable Faith; and that pure mortifying Documents will not be duly revered, while the mo&s;t &s;acred Prie&s;tly Ab&s;urdities are ever &s;o devout|ly mixed with them; nor can I even &s;ee the very Foundation of a modern Orthodoxy, or how the Me&s;&s;iah could bear the Sins of the World atoningly; but can ea&s;ily conceive how that ju&s;t and gallant Youth might &s;uffer for the unju&s;t, as a Soul con|victing Precedent, and noble Pattern of invincible Purity. I cannot &s;ee how our Creator can po&s;&s;ibly require or accept &s;uch Satisfaction; and &s;hould I even believe both undoubtedly, I could not per|ceive any Propriety in &s;uch Doctrine, or how the Sufferings of one Man could make adequate Satis|faction for the Sins of all Mankind; and I &s;uppo&s;e our Advocates for &s;uch a Propitiation, even the mo&s;t extravagant of them, will hardly &s;ay the Di|vine Nature &s;uffered. The Code of Probation is tryingly vailed, and letter Teachers, Antichri&s;tian Apo&s;tles, may very piou&s;ly wre&s;t its &s;acred Fi|gures, but never expound them according to the Law of a vital Faith.</P>

A true An&s;wer to &s;uch Que&s;tions, may not be very favourable to the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion upon Earth, or its mo&s;t celebrated Guardians; and were prie&s;tly My&s;teries ever &s;o divine, yet while I deem them to be impious, I can neither &s;incerely honour them, nor Threats or Cen&s;ure for contemning them, for no Per&s;on can &s;incerely honour Offen&s;ive Reproof or Threatnings but what he conceives ought to be revered.</P>

<P>I may incur the Di&s;plea&s;ure of haughty Mortals, but not of really great Men, if Truth, Decency, and clear Rea&s;oning always accompany my Free|dom; and nominally great Men, without e&s;&s;ential Greatne&s;s, are not only proper Objects of &s;uch al|lay'd Freedom as mine, but even of the keene&s;t decent Satyr can reach them; for indirect Proceed|ings are much more hurtful and blameable in Prin|ces, Noblemen, Philo&s;ophers, and Divines, than they can po&s;&s;ibly be in uncultivated Pea&s;ants, of a trifling Judgment and Influence. A common Gen|tleman, or to &s;peak more properly, a Per&s;on that might really be one, may even de&s;erve a &s;evere moral Cen&s;ure, for what a Dunce &s;hould be pitied; and when nominally great Men proceed indirectly, they &s;hould ever be more keenly reprehended than the Vulgar, but in a very different Manner, for as the latter have very gro&s;s Perceptions, as well as rude Pa&s;&s;ions, they mu&s;t often be very roughly treated, and even filled with intimidating Terror, ere they &s;ufficiently view an offen&s;ive Picture of their Conduct, or properly attend to the be&s;t Ad|moniton; and the former &s;hould be occa&s;ionally moved in a gentler or &s;harper Method, by the fair Dint of Rea&s;on alone. Plain Dealing al&s;o is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary on this Occa&s;ion, for when great Men ramble fondly after Prejudice, they hate to think they are going a&s;tray, and blindly gadding after a &s;oothing Delu&s;ion; &s;o rarely return from &s;uch favourite Wanderings, before they and their evil Tendency are explicitly di&s;clo&s;ed.

<P>According to the&s;e Ideas, I have endeavoured to place the Subject in a true Light, &s;o far as I have handled it, and to give our Superiors &s;uch open Conviction, through very explicit Arguments, as may rea&s;onably excite them to redre&s;s our Griev|ances, and abhor &s;uch Abu&s;es of Power for the fu|ture, but would not de&s;ignedly offend one of them by my very free&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions, which I think only repre&s;ent Matters ju&s;tly, and even for &s;o laudable a Purpo&s;e, as that of re-uniting Great-Britain and her much di&s;turbed Colonies, in the &s;acred Bands of a perpetual Amity; nor will any Per&s;on decry my Ex|plicitne&s;s, that would have duly honoured a le&s;s Di&s;|play. By &s;uitable Rea&s;onings, I may argumen|tatively influence the Parliament, according to our ardent De&s;ire, but could not po&s;&s;ibly bully it into Compliance, &s;hould I even &s;tupidly attempt it; and we &s;hould not wilfully exa&s;perate it again&s;t us. The greate&s;t moral Agents &s;hould honour Free|dom they have rendered nece&s;&s;ary, and no truly great Man can ever re&s;ent Plain Dealing, which the great Part of his own Nature cannot explode.

Nor can I be ju&s;tly obnoxi|ous to Cen&s;ure, for inter&s;per&s;ing Religious Hints with political Arguments, while our Divines have a Share in the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, for that E&s;ta|bli&s;hment greatly countenances &s;uch a Mixture.</P>
<P>My Balls fly not generally at the ba&s;e De&s;igns of a Single Mr. Grenville, but of a menacing Evil of a much higher Nature, for I had much rather &s;lay a Parliamentary De&s;poti&s;m, than &s;pend my Am|munition again&s;t the Malevolence of an impotent Swaggerer. I would not hang or burn him in Ef|figy, as the potent Oppre&s;&s;or of our Colonies, nor take his Life as an impenitent Offender, but &s;pare the haughty Criminal Time for Repentance, though perhaps to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I cannot always honour old Maxims, for &s;ome of them are but very poor Ones; and I think new Ones, awfully &s;uperior, will &s;oon be u&s;hered into a &s;ecure World, when it never le&s;s &s;u&s;pected them, and even without the great A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Bi&s;hop|prick,

a prie&s;tly Illumination, or a &s;chola&s;tick Om|ni&s;ciency, and not only from a Per&s;on very un|likely to &s;pread them, but al&s;o from a Place the the mo&s;t unlikely to produce them, according to the Ideas of earthly Gods. The&s;e are my deep rooted Conceptions, and I know not how they may fare abroad, but have Rea&s;on to fear many Sages will treat them as idle &s;anatical Notions; for my under&s;tanding Neighbours have long contemned them, and me for adhering blindly to &s;uch Whims, as Men of too profound Judgment to mind either; and as I could not drive their powerful Contempt away, I &s;eemed generally to be in&s;en&s;ible of it, as a Per&s;on having Ears that could not hear, and Eyes that could not &s;ee, but &s;ecretly cheri&s;hed my Sort of Vanity, according to the Cu&s;tom of &s;uch con|ceited Bigots, and never thought them altogether &s;o wi&s;e, nor my&s;elf quite &s;o fooli&s;h as their Words and Behaviour denoted. They or I have wandered &s;trangely, and perhaps the&s;e Lines may &s;hew &s;ome of my Readers which Party has blindly and proud|ly roamed.</P>
<P>My Arguments now draw near a Conclu&s;ion, and I think every Member of our high Court of Parliament, by conde&s;cending to weigh them de|liberately, may clearly view the Irregularity of the Stamp-Tax, and the &s;hocking Tendency of any Sort of arbitrary Proceedings, even in many important Re&s;pects, and that loyal Americans cannot be taxed at Home, under any Pretence whatever, with|out a manife&s;t Outrage again&s;t their con&s;titu|tional Rights. The idle Pretence of our being re|pre&s;ented in Parliament, the fictitious Right foun|ded upon it, and the wretched Policy which con|tended for them, mu&s;t now appear utterly con|temptible to all that will view their naked Deformity, as far as it is faithfully exhibited by this Picture; and yet it cannot even be coulourably di&s;puted, but

the Crown &s;hould have its rea&s;onable Demands oc|ca&s;ionally granted, as &s;oon at lea&s;t as our own De|legates can do it on a regular Plan, which no doubt is a Matter of very great Con&s;equence, that &s;hould be maturely con&s;idered and timely effected. Were but our numerous Colonies wi&s;ely united, for that very momentous Purpo&s;e, their own American Par|liament, extracted from Provincial A&s;&s;emblies, might con&s;titutionally weigh his Maje&s;ty's Requi|&s;itions, when occa&s;ionally convened, and dutifully honour all his rea&s;onable Demands, without arbi|trary Impo&s;itions, partial Exemptions, or unrea|&s;onable Burdens.</P>
<P>Thus publick Evils might nor only be regularly prevented, but a great Utility as cordially advanced throughout all the dangerous and favourable Vici&s;|&s;itudes of perpetual Ages, according to the ge|nuine Dictates of a con&s;titutional Policy; for as I have formerly &s;hewn, every valuable Occupation in our exten&s;ive Empire, has a con&s;iderable Num|ber of Voters, and while all them various Callings are duly favoured by wi&s;e and faithful Delegates, every Member of each Vocation which cannot elect them, is virtually repre&s;ented and befriended, and &s;hould con&s;equently be taxed by them, for the En|couragement and Support of a publick Welfare, which promotes his own private Benefits, and ren|ders them &s;ecure. Upon &s;uch a whole&s;ome E&s;ta|bli&s;hment, good Monarchs, and faithful Repre&s;en|tatives of loyal Subjects, might not only proceed very harmoniou&s;ly, but lay each other under mu|tual Obligations of a &s;overeign Nature, and always promote a publick Weal by the mo&s;t natural Kind of moral Policy: And &s;hould Briti&s;h Lords and Commons yet lay Impo&s;itions upon us, and thus render the Grants of the Crown de&s;picable, under a Pretence of advancing the royal Prerogative, I know no legi&s;lative Ve&s;tments they can now tax us

under, as their fine parliamentary Cloak of a vir|tual Repre&s;entation is even irreparably rended in Pieces. The Power of an Engli&s;h Legi&s;lature may &s;oon oppre&s;s us, and perhaps drive us into Bondage at Length, but a con&s;titutional Ju&s;tice cannot au|thori&s;e it to tax us, nor true Policy lead it to any Kind of arbitrary Proceedings, as my unlearned Pen has briefly demon&s;trated, and might much more illu&s;trate by expatiating greatly; &s;o well may learned ones render it con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>I have now clo&s;ed my open Ob&s;ervations on this important Subject, and I hope every judicious Reader of Candour will approve them, notwith|&s;tanding my &s;oaring Freedom and Cen&s;ure; for trifling will not do on &s;uch alarming Emergencies. Our Freedom is not only much wounded already, by a potent Ambition, but is even in great Danger of being intirely murdered by it, unle&s;s adequate Efforts prevent its threatned De&s;truction; and I have not only provided many valuable Materials for a &s;trong Fortre&s;s to defend it, but have al&s;o digged deep, cleared away the Rubbi&s;h, and laid its Foundation &s;urely on a very commanding Emi|nence: So let proper Arti&s;ts &s;peedily and formi|dably fini&s;h it, even according to the be&s;t Laws of Fortification.</P>
