<HEAD>CHAPTER I. Concerning the De&s;ign of the following Hi&s;to|ry&mdash;Epi&s;tle to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THO the following hi&s;tory &s;hould be found to contain no remarkable events to amaze the reader, yet it may lead him to at|tend to the progre&s;&s;ive &s;teps whereby others have ari&s;en from ob&s;cure poverty, and di&s;a&s;|trous conditions, to ea&s;y circum&s;tances. Tho no political &s;truggles will arre&s;t his atten|tion, no tragical &s;cenes convul&s;e his heart, yet a &s;ympathetic &s;igh may heave his gen|erous brea&s;t, while he follows an individual &s;truggling with difficulties which for a time &s;eem in&s;urmountable.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="025609_0012_0FCE0FF8041F38B8">
Hi&s;tories may detail the wa&s;teful &s;cenes of war; or celebrate, in poli&s;hed periods, the glories of victory and conque&s;t; or de&s;cribe the ri&s;e and fall of &s;tates and kingdoms.&mdash;I aim not at &s;cenes like the&s;e&mdash;Be it mine to write of worth, to detail tran&s;actions, and unfold virtues which dignify human nature, and extend the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. I &s;hall endeavor u&s;efully to amu&s;e a winter's even|ing, or profitably fill up a vacant hour, by the recital of tho&s;e means whereby that indi|vidual &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;truggled with uncom|mon difficulties, and ro&s;e to a degree of worth and con&s;equence, that might excite the envy of little minds, but would provoke the emulation of more noble &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence he gained was not owing to the caprice of fortune, but to the natural operations of well directed indu&s;try, uniform &s;obriety and virtue. The reader will follow the incidents of fortune attending his early days, the progre&s;s and means of his improve|ments; and the events that led to his &s;ub&s;e|quent condition. He will &s;ee an outca&s;t orphan floating on a boi&s;terous ocean, with|out a friendly hand extended to his relief, directing his little bark to a peaceful &s;hore. He will ob&s;erve the efforts of genius making improvements without means, and gaining
<PB N="15" REF="025609_0013_0FCE0FF98079A4A0">
rank in &s;ociety without friends. He will mark the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays of indu&s;try encounter|ing the rude wilderne&s;s, and follow its &s;teady operations, until he &s;ees the recumbent for|e&s;t blo&s;&s;oming as a ro&s;e, and the quiet po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or enjoying all the plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life, pur&s;uing rural occupations, and inherit|ing the fruits of his well earned property in the evening &s;hades of life.</P>
<P>To delineate the &s;everal parts of a good character, and con&s;ider the means that led to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of it, is no le&s;s agreeable than u&s;eful. To ob&s;erve the dawnings of genius, and notice the efforts of a well di&s;|po&s;ed mind to gain knowledge, worth and e&s;teem, opens to us the avenues leading to them. To po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e in the humble cot|tage, or &s;canty tenement, affords the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or more plea&s;ure than all the exten&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions of the haughty landlord, who is de&s;pi&s;ed by the di&s;cerning, and dete&s;ted by his cring|ing &s;ervile dependents. To enjoy the e&s;|teem of others, is de&s;irable; but to de&s;erve it, mu&s;t give exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In order to merit the e&s;teem of others, we mu&s;t become acquainted with the duties of our particular profe&s;&s;ions, occupations or &s;tations in life, and di&s;charge the duties of them in the mo&s;t u&s;eful and agreeable man|ner.
<PB N="16" REF="025609_0014_0FCE0FFAD91D7950">
He who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es real worth may al|ways expect the inward homage of the heart, even tho he does not receive external marks of re&s;pect from others; for true dignity of character does not con&s;i&s;t in riches, nor in any of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions of rank in &s;ociety which command external re&s;pect. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human affairs, men may ri&s;e to places in civil &s;ociety which &s;eem to re|quire this external re&s;pect, with very little per&s;onal merit. Their elevation is &s;o far from dignifying their character, that it makes their want of real dignity but the more con|&s;picuous. The man of real worth and good|ne&s;s is e&s;teemed for his per&s;onal qualities.</P>
<P>If he di&s;tingui&s;hes him&s;elf as the head of a well regulated family, or as a kind and u&s;e|ful neighbor, he as really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es preemi|nence of character as he who&s;e virtues are made more con&s;picuous by rea&s;on of his having a more exten&s;ive field to di&s;play them in. The man who &s;hines for a while in &s;ome dazzling qualities, unfounded in virtue, will, like the falling meteor, &s;ink into ob&s;curity, while the man of real and &s;olid worth lives in the grateful memory of man, when he can no longer exert his virtues for their good&mdash;Still they e&s;teem, &s;till they venerate his character. The public e&s;teem and re&s;pect

follow him into the la&s;t &s;tage of life, and em|balm his name in perpetual remembrance.</P>
<P>If the reader &s;hould find any amu&s;e|ment for an evening in the following &s;heets, the writer will feel him&s;elf much gratified. If the reader acquire no new ideas, nor any u&s;eful impre&s;&s;ions, let him a&s;k him&s;elf who is in fault. Let him con&s;ider for who&s;e improvement they were written, and that will &s;ugge&s;t all the apology the writer wi&s;hes both for the &s;tyle and manner in which they appear. If he is not di&s;couraged in the peru&s;al of a few pages, he will in &s;ome parts of the narrative &s;ee the &s;miles of new born happine&s;s, the glad&s;ome harve&s;t in&s;piring the cheerful &s;ong, and the glow of manly pride excited by ri&s;ing wealth and independence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Parentage of Charles Worthy&mdash;why called Poor Charles&mdash;the Death of his Father&mdash;the Cruelty of an oppre&s;&s;ive Neighbor.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES Worthy was the elde&s;t &s;on of Mr. George Worthy, who lived in the town of B&mdash;, a large and re&s;pectable town in the county of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word">. Tho he was poor, yet he was indu&s;trious and virtuous. He never repined at his &s;ituation, but en|deavoured to get as good a &s;upport for his family as his health would permit; and, al|tho he fared hard, yet he would often &s;ay, with pious &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&mdash;"It is better than I de&s;erve." His wife was a very meek, pious woman, and was contented with her con|dition. She made the be&s;t of every thing he brought home. She never had occa&s;ion to reproach him either with neglect, or with wa&s;ting what he earned; nor did &s;he fret and repine, as many do, becau&s;e &s;he had not &s;uch things as &s;he wi&s;hed for, and in|deed was &s;ometimes de&s;titute even of nece&s;|&s;aries. Her heart was &s;ometimes ready to bur&s;t with grief, when her children cried
<PB N="19" REF="025609_0017_0FCE1001CAE45480">
for bread, and &s;he had none to give them. But &s;he would comfort her&s;elf with this thought, "God will never leave nor for&s;ake them who tru&s;t in him;" that "he will &s;up|ply the faithful poor with bread." She in|&s;tructed her children as well as &s;he was able, and clothed them by her indu&s;try. Altho Mr. Worthy was not able to do as much for the &s;upport of his family as many poor peo|ple, on account of his feeble con&s;titution, yet he was kind to his wife, and affectionate in his conduct towards his children. This cir|cum&s;tance, as it endeared him to his family, rendered his death the more afflicting to them, e&s;pecially as it was occa&s;ioned by an act of great cruelty.</P>
<P>It was very unfortunate for Mr. Worthy, that the little &s;pot of land he owned joined to one of tho&s;e unfeeling wretches who &s;eem to delight in grinding the face of the poor. This oppre&s;&s;ive man was an overgrown farm|er, who had grown rich upon the &s;poils of tho&s;e who fell into his debt. This poor man had been obliged to take of him &s;ome nece&s;|&s;aries for his family, at a time when he was unable to work. Tho the amount was but &s;mall, yet he could not pay it when demand|ed, and was thrown into pri&s;on, by his mer|cile&s;s creditor, in the winter. The great
<PB N="20" REF="025609_0018_0FCE10032758E040">
di&s;tre&s;s of mind occa&s;ioned by the &s;ituation of his family, together with a violent cold, threw him into a fever, of which he died in about ten days.</P>
<P>That which added much to the di&s;tre&s;s of his afflicted widow, was, &s;he found it nece&s;|&s;ary to part with her children to &s;uch places as could be procured for them. But her elde&s;t &s;on, being able to afford her a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, remained with her, and being a very dutiful child, was a great comfort to his mother. He helped to &s;upport her, both by his labor, and by going to a&s;k alms of &s;ome of the neighbors, who&s;e charitable di&s;po|&s;ition contributed much to his mother's com|fort and &s;upport. Charles behaved him&s;elf in &s;o mode&s;t and clever a manner on all occa&s;ions, and e&s;pecially when he applied to any one for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he was known in all the neighborhood by the name of POOR CHARLES; for every one who knew him, loved and pitied him, except that hard hearted man who thru&s;t his father into pri&s;on, and was &s;o vexed that he could not get Charles into his &s;ervice, that he took every opportunity to afflict his poor mother. There are &s;ome people who &s;eem to think that the earth was created for them alone, and that they have a right to the &s;ervice of every one
<PB N="21" REF="025609_0019_0FCE1005A3E97F28">
on whom they can lay their hands; and therefore will wring the la&s;t farthing from their poor neighbors, without any regard to their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, or the calls of a dependent family.</P>
<P>Poor Charles, tho meanly clothed, was always clean, and was a very promi&s;ing boy. It was fortunate for him that he had been u&s;ed to work from his infancy, and was there|fore a &s;trong healthy boy. He had a great de&s;ire to learn; and tho he had little op|portunity at &s;chool, yet his mind kept pace with his body. It was a great grief to him that he could not go to &s;chool and learn, as many other boys did. But his mother, to whom he continued to pay all dutiful re|&s;pect, ob&s;erving his great eagerne&s;s to learn, was careful to in&s;truct him in reading by the dim torch that glimmered in her &s;olitary abode in the evening. She had been well taught in her early days, and, being a pious woman, had cultivated her mind as much as her &s;ituation would admit of, in the knowl|edge of letters as well as of religious truth. In both of the&s;e re&s;pects &s;he endeavored to communicate to her &s;on. In this &s;itua|tion this poor woman began to promi&s;e her|&s;elf &s;ome comfort in having a &s;on &s;o dutiful and amiable to continue with her. But alas,
<PB N="22" REF="025609_0020_0FCE1006D49E4648">
how often are we di&s;appointed in that on which we &s;eemed mo&s;t to rely!</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments of this poor woman are not yet at an end. They had been many and great, from various cau&s;|es. But that which reduced her to the la&s;t extremity, and indeed was thought to ha&s;t|en her to the grave, was the further cru|elty of that oppre&s;&s;ive neighbor, in tak|ing away her cow, to &s;ati&s;fy a demand which &s;he had every rea&s;on to believe her poor hu&s;band had laboured to di&s;charge while living. But as there were no legal evidence of it, the cow mu&s;t go to &s;ati&s;fy the demand. This cow was purcha&s;ed by the &s;avings they had &s;queezed out of their little earnings, and came lowing at the door every night to &s;upply them with a plenty of milk. This u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary creature was taken from her at a time when her health required the enjoyment of it. But neither the tears of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed widow, nor the cries of Poor Charles, who&s;e little heart was ready to bur&s;t on the occa&s;ion, could procure any lenity from this haughty unfeeling man.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance deprived her of the little remains of dome&s;tic plea&s;ure &s;he had till now enjoyed. As mo&s;t of the little furni|ture &s;he had went with the cow, and her
<PB N="23" REF="025609_0021_0FCE10084EC8FD08">
health was declining, &s;he began to think of a place for her &s;on, and to ca&s;t her&s;elf upon the public for a &s;upport. This was a mo&s;t grievous thing indeed to her. But being a pious woman, &s;he endeavoured patiently to &s;ubmit to her condition. As every thing on earth looked dark and gloomy, &s;he drew her con&s;olation from the pro&s;pects of an in|heritance fairer than any that the world could afford. Firmly relying on the wi&s;|dom and equity of Divine Providence, how|ever dark and my&s;terious in &s;ome of its operations, &s;he cheerfully committed her&s;elf and her children to the care of their heav|enly Father; and, "having ca&s;t anchor with|in the vail," &s;he re&s;olved to outride all the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts that beat on this boi&s;t|erous &s;hore.</P>
<P>I would only remark here, that a bad neighbor is one of the greate&s;t pe&s;ts inci|dent to our &s;ocial &s;tate. The unavoidable intercour&s;e of people of the &s;ame neigh|borhood makes their enjoyment of life very dependent on each other. When therefore an individual di&s;turbs the peace of tho&s;e about him, and vexes tho&s;e who&s;e quiet and happine&s;s he &s;hould &s;tudy, he becomes an object of hatred, perhaps of dread and de|te&s;tation
<PB N="24" REF="025609_0022_0FCE100B0CF93E48">
to all about him. This was truly the ca&s;e with this cruel neighbor. He was beloved by none, hated by mo&s;t, and de&s;|pi&s;ed by all; for he was trouble&s;ome to all around him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The Death of Charles' Mother&mdash;His Treat|ment at Mr. Gruff's&mdash;his fortunate E&s;|cape from that old Churl's.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not long before the death of Poor Charles' mother, that a di&s;tant rela|tion who lived in the town of F&mdash;, was pa&s;&s;ing that part of the country where they lived, and hearing of their &s;ituation, called to inquire after their welfare&mdash;or, what is more probable, to procure a likely boy for his own convenience, for he had been in|formed of Charles' good character. This is too often all the charity that actuates peo|ple in taking orphan children. They have their own ends to an&s;wer; and when that is done, little el&s;e is cared for. How few are there who con&s;ider the helple&s;s &s;tate of &s;uch children, and treat them with the tenderne&s;s which humanity and chri&s;tian charity dic|tate! The language of common conduct is&mdash;"They are poor, and if taught to labor well, that is enough. If they learn to read and to write, it is well&mdash;if not, it is no matter: As to their morals, let them take care of them&s;elves." This is the practical
<PB N="26" REF="025609_0024_0FCE100E87020588">
language of their guardians. But when they a&s;&s;ume the name of guardians, let them act in character. If &s;uch children are fed and clothed well, they will do the more &s;ervice. If well in&s;tructed, they will be the more u&s;eful; and if their morals are well guarded, they will be the more faithful. Ragged clothes, hard knocks, and hungry bel|lies, too often con&s;titute the charity &s;hown to orphan children.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was Poor Charles' mother bur|ied, than he began to experience the kind of charity his patron had in view.</P>

<P>He was put to hard labor, and kept ince&s;|&s;antly at it. He was meanly clad, and not much better fed. No generous ma&s;ter would have put a &s;lave to the &s;evere drudgery that was demanded of Charles. A boy of &s;o cheerful a di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;o ready and wil|ling to do every thing he was called to, ought to be encouraged and kindly treated. But when men are influenced by no motives but per&s;onal intere&s;t, or capricious pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t obedient and faithful of tho&s;e under them often fare wor&s;t. This was literally true in the ca&s;e of Charles; for the more he endeavoured to plea&s;e, the more he was abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conceal the real name of this per|&s;on, as I wi&s;h to expo&s;e his ba&s;ene&s;s as a warning to others, rather than his name as a
<PB N="28" REF="025609_0026_0FCE101454BC0390">
reproach to his &s;urviving friends. That which affected Poor Charles the mo&s;t, was, that Mr. Richard Gruff, for &s;o I &s;hall call him, would allow him no time for learning, on which his heart was very much &s;et. Mr. Gruff was a wealthy farmer, in the town of F&mdash;, and county of M&mdash;. He was one of tho&s;e churli&s;h beings, who, as they can|not enjoy any thing in life them&s;elves, will not &s;uffer tho&s;e about them to have any en|joyment. He thought it u&s;ele&s;s to give his children much learning; and much le&s;s did he regard the education of a charity boy. Charles was therefore defeated in all his attempts to get learning. His good di&s;po|&s;ition recommended him to every one who knew him except to Mr. Gruff, who &s;eemed to be in&s;en&s;ible to any thing gentle and ami|able. Indeed the marks of genius which he di&s;covered, &s;urprized many people who knew him. Already had he learned to read, tho but poorly, under the care of his moth|er. So that when he could get any little books from the children of the neighbor|hood, who loved him on account of his good di&s;po&s;ition, he would read them whenever he could find any opportunity. This procur|ed him many a &s;colding, and &s;ometimes a &s;evere whipping from Mr. Gruff, who could
<PB N="29" REF="025609_0027_0FCE1015E682B808">
&s;ee no advantage from boys reading "worth|le&s;s books," as he called them.</P>
<P>No arguments could prevail on this igno|rant, hard hearted man, to give Charles an opportunity at &s;chool to learn writing and arithmetic, tho he was growing fa&s;t, and be|gan now to be a large boy, and rendered Mr. Gruff great &s;ervice. This grieved Charles to the heart, and often made him a&s;hamed when in company with other boys. As he &s;aw no probability of &s;ucceeding in his wi&s;hes by entreaty, he determined to at|tempt it by his own ingenuity and appli|cation. Having no materials to begin with, and not being able to procure any of Mr. Gruff, nor money to purcha&s;e them, he con|&s;tructed a trap to catch quails and other game, that he might rai&s;e money to procure them him&s;elf. In the neighborhood of Mr. Gruff there lived a very worthy family by the name of Heathorn. This family had been very kind to Charles, and &s;eemed to compa&s;&s;ionate his ca&s;e. This was a fortu|nate circum&s;tance for Charles, for when he caught &s;ome game, he applied to Mr. Heath|orn to &s;end them to market the next time his man went, and to have the effects laid out in paper and an arithmetic book. Ink he could make him&s;elf from maple bark boiled
<PB N="30" REF="025609_0028_0FCE101A11F584D8">
with a little copperas, and quills he could gather without expen&s;e. At the time Mr. Heathorn's man was to return from market, Charles went over in the du&s;k of the even|ing, high fraught with expectation from the &s;ucce&s;s of the adventure. What then mu&s;t have been his &s;urprize and mortification, when he was informed that, by an unavoid|able accident, his game was lo&s;t, and none of the articles were procured. Poor Charles could no longer contain him&s;elf, but bur&s;t into a flood of tears, and lamented his un|happy fate in &s;uch melting &s;trains, that Mr. Heathorn was much affected on the occa&s;ion; and encouraged him to make another trial, a&s;&s;uring him that, at all events, the articles &s;hould be procured for him the next time he &s;ent to market. He al&s;o told Charles that "his &s;on Edward, who under&s;tood writing and cyphering very well, would be at home in a few days, and would afford him a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in learning him."</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Heathorn gave Charles a little paper, and lent him a &s;mall ink&s;tand till he could make one for him&s;elf, for his ingenuity was &s;uch, that he would &s;oon make almo&s;t any thing of which he had a model. Thus equipt and encouraged, Charles returned home in high &s;pirits, to
<PB N="31" REF="025609_0029_0FCE101B1E6A4528">
make his fir&s;t attempt at writing. No &s;ooner had he reached home, than, regardle&s;s of his &s;upper of &s;ky blue milk, he &s;at down by a dim candle to make his marks, which he did without interruption this evening, as Mr. Gruff was abroad. In the morning Charles ro&s;e earlier than u&s;ual, and was pur|&s;uing his de&s;ign with great attention. But the mortifications of this ill fated boy are not yet at an end; when Mr. Gruff got up, and found him at this bu&s;ine&s;s, he began a mo&s;t violent &s;torm, and in order to vent his &s;pleen at Charles for wa&s;ting his time, as he called it, he threw the ink&s;tand again&s;t the chimney back, and the paper into the fire, and ordered him immediately to the barn to take care of the cattle.</P>
<P>Thus deprived in an in&s;tant of what he held mo&s;t dear and valuable, he went out to execute the orders he had received. His heart was ready to bur&s;t on the occa&s;ion. Such barbarous treatment almo&s;t killed him. But his habits of obedience had been &s;uch from infancy, that he went without grumb|ling, and &s;ubmitted to this &s;everity with &s;ome degree of fortitude. An incident took place on this occa&s;ion which &s;hows the folly and danger of indulging violent pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;|pecially on trivial occa&s;ions. Mr. Gruff
<PB N="32" REF="025609_0030_0FCE101DEA461138">
paid dear for the indulgence of his pa&s;&s;ion at this time. Not &s;atisfied with de&s;troying Charles' paper and ink, be&s;ides u&s;ing very abu&s;ive language to him, he attempted to give him a blow, as he was going out at the door, but Charles being too &s;pry for him, jumped down the &s;teps out of his reach. The old churl lo&s;t the balance of him&s;elf in making this effort, and came tumbling after him to the bottom of the &s;teps, much to the injury of his head and &s;houlders.</P>
<P>As Charles was doing his morning's work, he reflected on his &s;ituation as almo&s;t de&s;pe|rate. His mind &s;eemed half di&s;tracted. He &s;ometimes thought of leaving Mr. Gruff pri|vately, and &s;eeking his fortune in the wide world&mdash;Here again a thou&s;and evils met him&mdash;No friends to throw him&s;elf upon&mdash;The &s;hame of running away&mdash;The difficulty of procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and many other things crowded in upon the mind. He recollected al&s;o the fate of John Shields, a lad who had not long before left his place with Mr. James Furniel. This lad, finding him&s;elf beyond the re&s;traints of a ma&s;ter or guardian, fell into many evil practices, and at la&s;t was brought into a very di&s;graceful condition, by means of connecting him&s;elf with &s;ome bad companions. Charles, tho young, had
<PB N="33" REF="025609_0031_0FCE10204BDA06F0">
con&s;ideration enough to think of the&s;e things, and to apprehend the danger he might be in from &s;uch a mea&s;ure; and therefore determined to put on re&s;olution to bear whatever &s;hould be laid upon him, and to do his duty whether others did theirs or not.</P>
<P>In this conduct of Charles we have a &s;trik|ing evidence of the u&s;efulne&s;s of early im|pre&s;&s;ions. Had the powers of nature been left like the wild fore&s;t without cultivation he would not have rea&s;oned thus. His mother had early impre&s;t his mind both with the duty and the &s;afety of being faithful. She a&s;&s;ured him that God would not leave nor for&s;ake tho&s;e who were true and faith|ful to their tru&s;t&mdash;that altho they might be brought to many &s;traits and difficulties, yet if they continued &s;teady in doing what they were &s;et about, and faithful to their tru&s;t, they might leave the event. The&s;e pious le&s;&s;ons had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on Charles' mind, e&s;pecially as he &s;aw an example of it in her, and being a lad of an enterprizing &s;pirit, he re&s;olved to continue faithful to Mr. Gruff, till he could get out of his hands in a proper way.</P>
<P>Nothing could divert him from the pur|&s;uit of the nece&s;&s;ary materials for writing
<PB N="34" REF="025609_0032_0FCE1023E9148E48">
and cyphering. Nor was it long before he obtained them by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Heathorn, who&s;e &s;on was now ready to aid his de&s;igns by any in&s;truction in his power. But &s;uch was Mr. Gruff's watchfulne&s;s le&s;t Charles &s;hould <HI>wa&s;te</HI> &s;ome of his time at this employment, that he was obliged to hide his paper. In order that he might &s;ecure it from Mr. Gruff's reach, he hid it in the garret, under the roof of the hou&s;e, where the &s;tiffened knee of his cruel per&s;ecutor could not bend in &s;earch for it. Hence this poor lad drew forth his apparatus as it were by &s;tealth, and watching his opportunities, made con&s;iderable advances, both in writing and arithmetic. All the money he could get, he laid out for books, paper, &amp;c.&mdash;and by his great application and per&s;everance he acquir|ed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of knowledge. His thir&s;t for knowledge was not abated by the difficulties he had to encounter; nor could any thing divert him from his pur&s;uit after it. A &s;pirit &s;o enterprizing could not fail of making progre&s;s without u&s;ual means.</P>
<P>Charles did not forget the good in&s;truc|tions his mother had given him, tho amid&s;t the hurry and confu&s;ion of worldly affairs at Mr. Gruff's there was no appearance of religion. He continued to repeat the pray|ers
<PB N="35" REF="025609_0033_0FCE1026767F2048">
his mother had taught, every night and morning; and it was a comfort to him in this unfriended &s;ituation, to recollect any thing his mother had taught him. He al|ways went to public wor&s;hip, and was very attentive while there. Indeed Mr. Gruff was exemplary in this re&s;pect. He was &s;el|dom ab&s;ent from public wor&s;hip, but his conver&s;ation, like that of Agricola, was wholly "about the oxen of the field." Charles would often mention, to tho&s;e to whom he could &s;peak freely, &s;omething the mini&s;ter &s;aid, which &s;howed he did not go there to laugh and play, as many boys do; but to hear and regard what was &s;aid. The clergyman, who was a kind benevolent man, ob&s;erved his attentivene&s;s, and took occa&s;ion to notice him &s;ometimes. As he knew the character of Mr. Gruff, he endeavoured to alleviate Charles' condition by &s;peaking kind|ly to him. He encouraged Charles to con|tinue to behave well, with an a&s;&s;urance that &s;uch never failed of doing well in the end. This was comfortable language to Charles. When he was relating this part of his hi&s;tory, which he often did in a circle of friends, he could &s;carcely &s;uppre&s;s the tears of gratitude for "the goodne&s;s of that excellent clergy|man," as he would expre&s;s it, and for that
<PB N="36" REF="025609_0034_0FCE1027CDF63418">
of Mr. Heathorn. Their benevolence &s;eem|ed &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted, and &s;o well applied, that it made an impre&s;&s;ion on Charles' heart that time it&s;elf could not efface.</P>
<P>Happy would it have been for Jeremy Demmond, and Mary Jennings, of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">, if &s;ome good people had taken compa&s;&s;ion on them, before the cruelties they experience|ed, and the hard blows they received on their heads, from tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate people to who&s;e care they were committed, had turned their brains, and made them di&s;tracted. They continued a long time, living monu|ments to all that part of the country, of the dreadful effects of &s;uch abu&s;es. It is a re|proach upon human nature, that in any in|&s;tances it &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t to feeling as to practice &s;uch cruelties upon tho&s;e helple&s;s orphans, who&s;e mi&s;fortunes put them into the power of others. It is a reproach upon &s;o|ciety that &s;uch cruelties &s;hould be &s;uffered in it. How many poor orphan children are daily &s;uffering unmerited abu&s;e from the un|relenting hands they fall into; without a friend in the world to &s;peak for them, or even to look compa&s;&s;ionately upon them! Some, no doubt, &s;ink under the weight of the&s;e abu&s;es, and find relief only in death. Others have their &s;pirits broken &s;o, that they
<PB N="37" REF="025609_0035_0FCE10298536D2D8">
become lifele&s;s and incapable of holding up their heads in &s;ociety; and being di&s;pirited, they have no power to make tho&s;e exertions which they might otherwi&s;e have done. This was not the ca&s;e indeed with Charles, for there were many who &s;eemed to pity him, and his &s;pirits were proof again&s;t all his &s;uf|ferings.</P>
<P>About this time an event took place that &s;u&s;pended his &s;ufferings for a while; and af|forded him an opportunity to give full proof of the goodne&s;s of his heart. It mu&s;t here be ob&s;erved, that among Mr. Gruff's many faults, covetou&s;ne&s;s, that dete&s;table vice which degrades men below the animals, was not the lea&s;t. So extremely did this mean &s;pirit prevail, that he would &s;ome|times endanger his life rather than not have it gratified. It well nigh co&s;t him his life, when on a cold evening he mounted his barefoot hor&s;e, for he was too covetous to be at the expen&s;e of having him &s;hod, to ride &s;ome di&s;tance on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s. On his return home, his hor&s;e fell on an icy place which a light &s;now had covered, and ran homeward with all &s;peed, leaving his rider &s;prawling on the ground. As Charles was returning from Mr. Heathorn's, whether he had taken this opportunity to go for im|provement
<PB N="38" REF="025609_0036_0FCE102E50321288">
in writing, &amp;c. the hor&s;e came on a full gallop; and Charles perceiving it to be Mr. Gruff's hor&s;e without the rider, &s;topt him, and apprehending that &s;ome di&s;a&s;ter had happened, led him back by the road he came. Having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;tance, he thought he heard the groaning of a per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, and, following the &s;ound, he arrived at the &s;pot where Mr. Gruff had fallen, and lay in a mo&s;t deplorable condition. He was &s;o di&s;abled by the fall, that he mu&s;t have peri&s;h|ed on the &s;pot, for it was extreme cold, had it not been for the good offices of Charles, who with great difficulty helped him home.</P>
<P>It was on this occa&s;ion, and during his confinement for the greater part of the win|ter, that Charles di&s;covered the goodne&s;s of his own heart. He expre&s;&s;ed great concern at the time, for what had happened, and con|tinued the mo&s;t faithful and careful attention to him, and to all his directions during his whole confinement. This was almo&s;t too much for Mr. Gruff to bear. It &s;oftened his heart, and made him repent of &s;ome of his ill natured treatment of Charles. The death of Mr. Gruff, not a great while after this, put a period to the &s;ufferings of Poor Charles at this place. As he had never been bound to Mr. Gruff, &s;o he con&s;idered him&s;elf at
<PB N="39" REF="025609_0037_0FCE102FC6764C00">
liberty to quit a place that was &s;o di&s;agree|able to him, which he did &s;oon after his death. As new pro&s;pects now open before him, and the &s;cene begins to brighten, we refer the reader to the next chapter for a fur|ther account of him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Charles' good conduct&mdash;his bravery and hu|manity in &s;aving a young officer&mdash;Lieutenant Smith's letter to his father concerning Charles&mdash;is invited to his father's hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was a mo&s;t fortunate e&s;cape for Charles Worthy. It opened the way for him to exert his native powers, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure to gratify his prevailing inclination, to improve his mind. Tho' he di&s;covered &s;uch a thir&s;t for knowledge, yet he never be|trayed the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to quit the bu&s;i|ne&s;s he had been &s;o far brought up in, that of farming. Indeed, he &s;eemed as am|bitious to excel in the art of farming as in the knowledge of letters. His views were not elevated above his employment, which proved a great advantage to him afterwards. He never felt &s;o happy as when con&s;cious of indu&s;triou&s;ly following his occupation, and faithfully di&s;charging the tru&s;t committed to him.</P>
<P>Charles was about &s;ixteen years old, when Mr. Gruff died, and of a healthy robu&s;t con|&s;titution. He had &s;erved there &s;everal years,
<PB N="41" REF="025609_0039_0FCE1033CF71B470">
but had very little more than the clothes on his back when he left that place. He was now to ca&s;t him&s;elf on the wide world, with|out a friend to a&s;&s;i&s;t, or even to advi&s;e him. His fir&s;t object was to go and vi&s;it his broth|ers and &s;i&s;ters, who were &s;cattered about in different places. The older ones had al|mo&s;t forgotten him, for he had never been allowed time to go and &s;ee them, and the younger ones &s;carce ever knew him. They were al&s;o almo&s;t grown out of his knowledge. But they were no &s;ooner made known to him, than he di&s;covered great brotherly affection for them, and &s;howed them every mark of affection in his power. He was much afflicted to find one of his lit|tle brothers in a very low &s;tate of health; and was induced to tarry and labor for Mr. Harding, with whom he lived, that he might have an opportunity of affording his broth|er every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power, until he died, which was not long after. Charles was very much grieved at the death of his broth|er, and Mr. Harding was de&s;irous of hav|ing Charles continue with him, but he cho&s;e to vi&s;it his little &s;i&s;ter, who was an infant when his father died, and was placed in the hands of a di&s;tant relation of his mother, in the town where &s;he lived and died. He
<PB N="42" REF="025609_0040_0FCE10362B1724A8">
the rather declined Mr. Harding's offer of &s;mall wages, as he hoped to find better bu&s;i|ne&s;s at this place. But being di&s;appointed in this re&s;pect, and finding his little &s;i&s;ter well provided for, he returned to Mr. Hard|ing on the terms he had propo&s;ed, which were but &s;mall, indeed, but were the be&s;t he could then obtain.</P>
<P>Charles had nothing in the world to rely upon but his own character. He &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of this, and endeavoured to recom|mend him&s;elf by his good conduct. He was not wholly free from the &s;allies of youth, but he carefully avoided the follies and ex|ce&s;&s;es too common among young men. He was generally &s;ober and grave, and always temperate. By pre&s;erving him&s;elf in this &s;tate, he was always fit for duty and enjoy|ment. He abhorred fal&s;ehood; and never u&s;ed any bad language, either ob&s;cene or pro|fane. His tongue was never polluted with the foul language of profane &s;wearing, and he would often check his companions whom he heard u&s;e it. How much more honorable would it be in young men to u&s;e the &s;ame caution, than to give a loo&s;e to their tongues in the manner they often do! What in|ducement can they have to it?

and u&s;ele&s;s practice. It al&s;o has a mo&s;t baneful influence on civil &s;ociety. It affords no evidence of wit or &s;en&s;e, of courage or good breeding. The lowe&s;t and mo&s;t aban|doned among men are great adepts in it, and in them it is con&s;idered as a mark of de|pravity. Will decent people practice the &s;ame as an evidence of their good breeding? The cu&s;tom of profane &s;wearing has a ten|dency to introduce perjury, and otherwi&s;e to injure the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. By making oaths familiar on all occa&s;ions, it le&s;&s;ens that veneration for the Deity, and that reverence for an oath which makes it u&s;eful on proper occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall pa&s;s over &s;everal years of Charles' life, after the death of Mr. Gruff, in which there were no incidents worthy of particu|lar notice. During this period he laid up a &s;mall &s;um of money, which his indu&s;try had acquired, and his prudence pre&s;erved. He had the good fortune to recommend him&s;elf to the e&s;teem of tho&s;e with whom he lived, and never wanted for employ. At length he was tempted by a con&s;iderable bounty to enli&s;t among the troops who were going to the frontiers again&s;t the &s;avages. It was dur|ing this campaign that Charles had an op|portunity of &s;howing him&s;elf to be both

brave and generous. His courage had been tried by &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes with the enemy. But about the beginning of October he was in a pretty &s;evere engagement, in which the enemy got the advantage. During this en|gagement, a young officer by the name of Smith was badly wounded, and left on the ground. Charles perceiving this, flew to his relief, and at the hazard of his own life, re&s;|cued him from the hands of the pur&s;uing enemy. In doing this, Charles was &s;lightly wounded in two places, which, tho not deep, bled profu&s;ely. But this generous young &s;oldier &s;eemed regardle&s;s of him&s;elf in his exertions to &s;ave this brave young officer, who&s;e wounds were &s;o much wor&s;e than his own.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Smith was carried to the fort, where the fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ings were performed, and in a &s;hort time was in a condition to be re|moved to the ho&s;pital at <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">. Charles &s;oon recovered of his wounds, &s;o far as to be able to attend Lieutenant Smith, who re|que&s;ted of the commanding officer permi&s;|&s;ion to keep him as a nur&s;e, until he &s;hould be recovered. This removal through rough roads did him a great injury, and threw him into a violent fever, which endangered his life. His wounds were painful, and his &s;itu|ation

truly deplorable; but the con&s;tant at|tention and great tenderne&s;s of Charles, was a great alleviation of his condition, and en|deared Charles very much to him. It was a con&s;iderable time before he recovered &s;o far as to write to his friends. During this interval, which &s;eemed very long to them, they could hear nothing of him. Various reports were circulated about him; but none that could be relied on. His parents who lived in the county of <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">, were very ap|prehen&s;ive that he was either killed, or made a pri&s;oner of by the &s;avages.

</LETTER>
<P>The receipt this letter di&s;pelled a thick cloud that had for &s;ome time hung over the family, and &s;pread joy through the hou&s;e. Mr. Smith prepared to go on immediately to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;on, and on his arrival found him in a fine way. The arrival of his father afforded one of tho&s;e affecting &s;cenes which intere&s;t the feelings of the heart. It was &s;uch as might naturally be expected at the fir&s;t meeting between an affectionate parent and a long lo&s;t &s;on. Nor was the &s;cene much le&s;s ten|der when Lieut. Smith pointed out Charles to his father, as the per&s;on of whom he had
<PB N="47" REF="025609_0045_0FCE1043AA6EE658">
written. Mr. Smith caught Charles by the hand, but had no power of utterance.&mdash;As &s;oon as he had a little recovered from the fir&s;t flow of his pa&s;&s;ions, occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t &s;ight of his &s;on's deliverer, he thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&mdash;"To you"&mdash;the tear &s;tarting in his eye&mdash;"to you I owe the liberty, the life of my &s;on&mdash;to you we owe the future peace and tranquillity of a much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family. If aught in my power can contrib|ute to your happine&s;s, name it, and it &s;hall be done." It was on this occa&s;ion that Charles conducted with a magnanimity pe|culiar to him&s;elf. He very mode&s;tly replied, with a low bow, "If he had been the means of adding to any body's happine&s;s, he was very glad; but what he had done for Lieu|tenant Smith, was no more than his duty, and nothing could be &s;o great a reward as the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing that." During Mr. Smith's tarry at the ho&s;pital with his &s;on, he had opportunity of &s;eeing the kind and benevolent di&s;po&s;ition of Charles. He was much plea&s;ed with him, and inquired of him where he had lived, and what had been his manner of life. Charles inform|ed Mr. Smith that "he had been bred a farmer, and not a &s;oldier;" and mode&s;tly related to him &s;ome of the hard&s;hips and
<PB N="48" REF="025609_0046_0FCE10464396FDB8">
&s;ufferings he had experienced at Mr. Gruff's, and "the di&s;advantages he laboured under on account of not being able to get learn|ing." Mr. Smith invited Charles to go to his hou&s;e, when his &s;on was able to return home, a&s;&s;uring him his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in improv|ing his mind, and offering him &s;mall wa|ges for the winter. This was very grateful to Charles, who&s;e term of enli&s;tment was now expired, and he knew not which way to turn him&s;elf. He therefore accepted Mr. Smith's offer with cheerfulne&s;s, and accom|panied him and his &s;on to his hou&s;e. It would be in vain to attempt a de&s;cription of the joy which their arrival occa&s;ioned. Im|agination mu&s;t &s;upply the deficiency of de|&s;cription.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. Some account of Mr. Smith, and his &s;ituation&mdash;Charles continues there &s;ome time&mdash;his pru|dence and improvements.&mdash;Anecdote of hone&s;t Jonny.</HEAD>
<P>AS Mr. Smith's hou&s;e became the place of Charles' re&s;idence for &s;ometime, and the theatre of &s;ome tran&s;actions important to this hi&s;tory, it cannot be thought improper to give a &s;hort account of him, and of his &s;ituation. Mr. Smith was an exten&s;ive land|holder, and a very re&s;pectable farmer in the town of S&mdash;, and county of<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">. His hou&s;e was a neat and convenient edifice, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the &s;outhern declivity of a hill, and commanded an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of well cultivated fields and meadows. His barn and granary were large and capacious; and were generally filled with the produce of his farm. His family and dome&s;tics were well fed, and kindly treated. The benevo|lent owner of this delightful retreat, &s;upport|ed the character of that genuine ho&s;pitality which in more modern times may appear ro|mantic. His family were examples of in|du&s;try, his hou&s;e the &s;eat of plenty, of peace
<PB N="50" REF="025609_0048_0FCE104C264A5A58">
and harmony. To the poor he was a daily benefactor. In every project for public good he took the lead; and was an example to all his neighbors, of regular and con&s;tant attendance on public wor&s;hip, with all his numerous family and dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>This was a paradi&s;e to Charles. He had never before been in &s;o well regulated a fam|ily. He &s;o ingratiated him&s;elf with Mr. and Mrs. Smith, that he continued with them a con&s;iderable time, and daily grew in their e&s;teem, as well on account of his amiable temper, as his faithfulne&s;s in their &s;ervice. It was during his re&s;idence here, that he made great proficiency in u&s;eful knowledge. The winter evenings, which mo&s;t other young people pa&s;&s;ed in a u&s;ele&s;s manner, if no wor&s;e, he &s;pent in reading, writing, arithmetic, &amp;c. This gave him a &s;uperiority to mo&s;t of the young people, both in knowledge and in writing well, and in readine&s;s at figures; and his ready wit, of which he had a good &s;hare, made him appear brilliant when he mixed with them. Charles derived many advan|tages from living in &s;o reputable a farmer's hou&s;e. Be&s;ides the many maxims of do|me&s;tic economy he learned from Mrs. Smith, with whom he was a favorite, he gathered many maxims from the experience of Mr. Smith, in the hu&s;bandry art.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="025609_0049_0FCE104D4F910FC8">
Having pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years in this &s;itua|tion, and laid up money enough to purcha&s;e a &s;mall tract of wild land, Charles began to think of looking for a &s;ettlement in life; but he did not think it prudent to take any &s;tep, e&s;pecially &s;o important an one as this, without advi&s;ing with Mr. Smith about it. This worthy patron approved his de&s;ign, and offered to lend him money, if he &s;hould &s;tand in need of more than he had. In this in&s;tance, Charles felt the benefit of a good character, he found the loan of a &s;mall &s;um nece&s;&s;ary to purcha&s;e a tract of land which was far preferable to that he had before in view. This was a tract in the frontier &s;et|tlements, which was to be &s;old on terms very advantageous to the purcha&s;er. By Mr. Smith's advice, Charles went on to view it, in company with a young man who was going on the &s;ame de&s;ign.</P>
<P>It was in this tour that Charles met with the following humorous affair, which de|&s;erves a place in the hi&s;tory of his adven|tures. The affair happened at a Mr. Scam|mon's, a man of &s;ome note in the back &s;et|tlements, to whom Mr. Smith had recom|mended Charles for advice. Mr. Scam|mon's ho&s;pitality was well known to many, and Charles reached his hou&s;e on Saturday
<PB N="52" REF="025609_0050_0FCE1051BA2A9060">
night, and was received with much courte&s;y on account of Mr. Smith's recommenda|tion. The next day they all went to pub|lic wor&s;hip at &s;ome di&s;tance, leaving only a Scotch lad to take care of the hou&s;e. This lad was rather a &s;tranger in that part of the country, and knew but little of the world he lived in. He had been taught, however, to read his bible. When the fa|mily were all gone, Jonny, for &s;o he was called, &s;at down very compo&s;edly to reading his bible. He had not been long at this employ|ment, before he was &s;urprized by the arrival of &s;everal men who made a &s;trange appear|ance, but with great familiarity were enter|ing the hou&s;e. This greatly alarmed the hone&s;t Highlander. But being educated in the habits of fidelity, he determined to de|fend the hou&s;e that had been left in his care. He therefore fa&s;tened the door, and, &s;eizing his broad &s;word, the only patrimony he en|joyed, put him&s;elf into a po&s;ture of defence. The Indians, however, regardle&s;s of the fright that Poor Jonny appeared to be in on this occa&s;ion, bur&s;t open the door, and without any ceremony, helped them&s;elves to &s;uch things as the hou&s;e afforded. This &s;o pro|voked the hone&s;t lad, that he ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of them, and in the language of his
<PB N="53" REF="025609_0051_0FCE10532A4A1C60">
own country, demanded who they were, and what they wanted. They under&s;tood about as much of his que&s;tion as he did of their an&s;wer, which was made in their own lan|guage. His pa&s;&s;ions were now wrought up to &s;uch a pitch, that his prudence entirely for&s;ook him. In the violence of his anger, he made a pa&s;s at one of them with his ru&s;ty &s;word, but fortunately mi&s;&s;ed his aim. This produced &s;o terrible a yell among them, that his fortitude in&s;tantly de&s;erted him, but his prudence &s;oon returned, and he took to his heels, leaving this horrible crew of infernals, as he &s;uppo&s;ed them to be, in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field. They were highly diverted at the con&s;ternation which their innocent free|dom had put this new comer to the country into. He made his way with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to the meeting hou&s;e, and running, with his hair all an end, to Mr. Scammons, informed him what was going on at home, and begged him to ha&s;ten with him to prevent further de&s;truction. Mr. Scammons inform|ed him that they were his friends, although they u&s;ed great freedom, yet it was common with that people, and a&s;&s;ured him he had nothing to fear from them.</P>
<P>This adventure Charles related to Mr. Smith on his return, and diverted the whole

family greatly with &s;everal other anecdotes of Jonny's hone&s;ty and &s;implicity. But what was of much more con&s;equence to Charles Worthy, than the adventures of the High|land lad, was, he had made a purcha&s;e of the land he went after. Mr. Smith heartily congratulated him on his becoming a land|holder, and told him he did not doubt but that he would one day be a wealthy farmer; that his indu&s;try would conquer the rough|ne&s;s of the fore&s;t; and his prudence would pre&s;erve the property he &s;hould acquire. He al&s;o informed Charles that he might make his hou&s;e his home in winter, till he could find one at his own place. This was a kind offer, and was mo&s;t thankfully accepted by him. At the proper &s;ea&s;on he went on to fell the trees, and prepare for a future har|ve&s;t, and to erect the nece&s;&s;ary buildings for his accommodation. Here he found many difficulties to grapple with; but his re&s;o|lution and per&s;everance carried him through them all, until he had &s;ubdued the wildne&s;s of the fore&s;t, and converted a &s;ufficient part of it into a fruitful field, to make it a de&s;irable place of &s;teady re&s;idence. Thus encourag|ed by the effects of his indu&s;try, and pre|pared for dome&s;tic life, by a dwelling &s;uit|able to begin life with in the country, he be|gan

now to think of a true &s;aying that "it is not fit for man to be alone." Tho Charles had acted with great di&s;cretion with regard to the &s;ex, by avoiding any appear|ances of attaching him&s;elf to one and an|other, yet they were not all alike indifferent to him. He was not at a lo&s;s where to offer him&s;elf. All his difficulty was about the manner of doing it with a probability of &s;ucce&s;s. On this occa&s;ion he had a mo&s;t critical, <HI>delicate</HI> part to act, as will appear by the following circum&s;tances.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of Timothy Puffum&mdash;young Mr. Worthy's marriage, &s;ettlement, and plea&s;ing pro&s;pects.</HEAD>
<P>YOUNG Mr. Worthy, for &s;o I &s;hall now call him, was a very mode&s;t youth, and had a heart of great &s;en&s;ibility and grat|itude. The&s;e were qualities that would recommend him to the parents of the young woman on whom he had placed his affection. But when he compared his circum&s;tances with their's, he &s;tarted at the idea of a&s;king their con&s;ent to his marrying one of their daughters. He al&s;o feared the imputation of ingratitude, and of violating the rights of ho&s;pitality, in forming an attachment with a female to who&s;e parents he had been in|debted by many acts of kindne&s;s. Indeed, every thing &s;eemed to be again&s;t him, except the countenance which Margrett, the young|e&s;t daughter of Mr. Smith, gave to his over|tures. This mutual and growing attach|ment was a &s;ecret to the family, and was &s;carce known unto them&s;elves until young Mr. Worthy's circum&s;tances enabled him to place this object of his affections in a toler|able
<PB N="57" REF="025609_0055_0FCE105C69CB0150">
&s;ituation. As &s;he had been well edu|cated in a farmer's hou&s;e, &s;he was the better qualified for a farmer's wife. Young Mr. Worthy was not in&s;en&s;ible of her worth; but he had difficulties to encounter that have not yet been named. The per&s;onal figure of &s;o blooming a girl had attracted the no|tice of &s;everal young men, and &s;he actually had an offer of marriage with a young man the only &s;on of Mr. Timothy Puffum, a man of large property, but very ignorant of the world, and had trained up his &s;on ac|cordingly. He had &s;everal daughters in|deed, but as it was not cu&s;tomary for daugh|ters to receive any great &s;hare of the e&s;tate, Timothy the &s;on was con&s;idered as the heir of a large e&s;tate.&mdash;Happy for daughters, that in modern times fathers are willing to own them as children in the di&s;tribution of their e&s;tates! However, as things then went, it was thought quite needle&s;s to bring up Timothy to any bu&s;ine&s;s; for why need one, who was heir to &s;o good a farm, learn to work upon it.&mdash;"I ob&s;erve, &s;aid old Mr. Puffum, that your mo&s;t riche&s;t merchants don't bring up their &s;uns to bu&s;ine&s;s; and I don't &s;ee for my part why our Tim needs be fetcht up as tho'f he was one of the mo&s;t vulgare&s;t &s;ort of fokes."</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="025609_0056_0FCE106062D63E50">
Timothy was trained up agreeably to the&s;e &s;entiments; and as his father had ex|perienced very little advantage from &s;chools when young, he was prevailed upon to keep him from &s;chool whenever his wife &s;aid "it is too cold or too wet for Timmy to go out; or, the poor boy is not well enough to go to &s;chool." Nothing can be more ruinous to children than &s;uch indulgence. It makes them peevi&s;h, fretful and unhappy. It learns them to be deceitful, and to pretend ill health, till they begin to imagine it real. It inter|rupts their learning, and di&s;courages them when they &s;ee their mates go before them. The con&s;equence of this mode of education was that Timothy Puffum, jun. proves a great blockhead. He could ride a hor&s;e well, and perform his part at a race or a &s;hooting match, and the like; but he had very little preten&s;ions to any improvements of mind, nor had he very great preten&s;ions to virtue.</P>
<P>He had but ju&s;t arrived at the age of man|hood when his father died, and left him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate, after paying a few legacies. Being now the proprietor of a large well cultivated farm, and con&s;iderable money at intere&s;t, he thought him&s;elf a good match for any lady in the country. What
<PB N="59" REF="025609_0057_0FCE1061A0A88CC8">
then mu&s;t have been his mortification when he found that Margrett Smith preferred a poor laboring young man to one of his fortune? It was this apparent preference that em|boldened young Mr. Worthy to broach the affair to her parents. Mr. and Mrs. Smith, both expre&s;&s;ed great &s;urprize at the propo&s;al. They rai&s;ed many objections, and declined for &s;ome time giving their con&s;ent. But upon finding that the attachment was too &s;trong to be broken, they yielded to the wi&s;hes of the young couple; and by con&s;ent of par|ents, young Mr. Worthy called the amia|ble and &s;prightly Margrett Smith his wife, the next chri&s;tmas eve. An event &s;o much wi&s;hed for on his part, and not objected to on her's, gave a new &s;pring to his &s;pirits, and he re&s;olved that nothing &s;hould be wanting on his part to de&s;erve the favor he had ob|tained. His fir&s;t object was to conciliate the minds of the parents to an event, to which they had con&s;ented with &s;ome reluctance; and as they were rational, good kind of people, he happily effected it. Probably they were actuated by the &s;ame maxim that Themi&s;tocles was, who married a daughter to a poor but de&s;erving man, &s;aying&mdash;"I love merit without wealth, better than wealth without merit."</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="025609_0058_0FCE1066570F07C8">
The &s;pring following their marriage, they bid adieu to their friends, and went to enter upon their new plantation, accompanied by her brother, whom Mr. Worthy had re&s;cued from the Indians, and who had been his friend in the affair or Margrett, and a prin|cipal in&s;trument in obtaining the con&s;ent of her parents. The &s;cene at parting was mo&s;t tender and affecting. The mother hung on the neck of the daughter, and with all the fondne&s;s of maternal affection, held her to her bo&s;om. While the father be&s;towed on them a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings, the children told the greatne&s;s of their pain by the profu&s;ion of their tears. But they were much relieved by the favorable accounts which young Mr. Smith brought back of their &s;ituation and pro&s;pects. This account he gave with all that ardor which we feel when we take a decided part in the affairs of another, and are deeply affected by their concerns. Young Mr. Smith had never forgotten his obligation to Mr. Worthy, and felt gratified at having an opportunity to repay &s;ome of the debt of grat|itude he owed him. Several circum&s;tances occurred in this tour which brought to his mind afre&s;h the whole of that &s;cene, which now led him to view Mr. Worthy as his deliverer and his brother.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="025609_0059_0FCE1068337566A0">
He repre&s;ented the &s;pot he had cho&s;en as a fertile &s;oil on the banks of a beautiful &s;tream that &s;oon empties it&s;elf into a large river, leaving a fine interval, and opening a mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pect. This &s;ituation invited many &s;ettlers, both on account of the goodne&s;s of the &s;oil, and the convenience of water carriage to market. It was on this cho&s;en &s;pot that Mr. Worthy fir&s;t felt him|&s;elf a freeholder, and independent of the caprice of others both for his exertions and his enjoyments. His farm, his hou&s;e, his barn, were objects which pre&s;ented new ideas to his imagination. The &s;ame objects never before made the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions on his mind. Whatever he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was his own. The knowledge he had acquired was the effect of his own exertions and per&s;evering application. The property he enjoyed was the fruit of his own labor; and his improvements were the effects of his own experience and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>His rural &s;ituation was no longer a gloomy &s;olitary retreat. The cheerfulne&s;s and pru|dence of his wife gave a new face to every thing; and he ta&s;ted new plea&s;ure in every enjoyment, and in every pur&s;uit. He went forth to his daily bu&s;ine&s;s with more alacrity and plea&s;ure than before, becau&s;e he now &s;aw that he did not labor for him&s;elf alone. His

joys were increa&s;ed by the &s;hare that Mar|gret took in them, and his &s;orrows were le&s;&s;en|ed by being divided.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Mr. Worthy's reflections on his own &s;ituation&mdash;birth of a &s;on&mdash;his humanity&mdash;tenderne&s;s to animals.</HEAD>
<P>THE birth of his fir&s;t &s;on was an event that almo&s;t overwhelmed Mr. Worthy with joy. Various motions of plea&s;ure thrilled through his heart on this occa&s;ion. He now felt him&s;elf acting in a new &s;phere, and moved by new obligations to fill up the duties of the relations of hu&s;band and father. As the number of their children afterwards increa&s;|ed, a &s;en&s;e of the obligations increa&s;ed, and with their growth the plea&s;ures of life grew al&s;o. What heart felt delight mu&s;t he have experienced when his little &s;on was able to go with him into the fields, and fol|low him with his prattle, in the opening fur|row? By this practice, the child drew in health with every breath, while he in&s;pired the parent's heart with joy through every vein. The Emperor of China, when plough|ing as an example to his kingdom,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Emperor of China is obliged to appear in the field at the head of his laborers in the &s;ea&s;on of plough|ing; and with his own hand hold the plough as an exam|ple of indu&s;try to the people of his kingdom. The Chi|ne&s;e are &s;aid to be an indu&s;trious people, and to under|&s;tand the vegetable &s;y&s;tem of nature better than any others. Their veneration for agriculture certainly ap|pears in this annual cu&s;tom of their Emperor's becoming a hu&s;bandman every &s;pring, in the encouragement given to it by their laws, and in the honors conferred on tho&s;e who excel in cultivating the ground.</NOTE> could not know the plea&s;ure he experienced.</P>

Mr. Worthy was not inattentive to the moral u&s;es to which many appearances in the natural world might be applied. The trees which drop their leaves and fruit in autumn, and bud again in the &s;pring, he con&s;idered as a lively emblem of the death and revivi&s;|cence, or ri&s;ing again of the human race. The difficulty that attended this doctrine he thought he &s;aw unfolded in the grain &s;pring|ing up after the apparent death of the &s;eed. The myriads of in&s;ects that ari&s;e from the earth, and play in the milder beams of the &s;etting &s;un, he thought afforded le&s;&s;ons of in|du&s;try to &s;hort lived man, and of the import|ance of a diligent improvement of the &s;hort &s;pace allotted him on earth. The a&s;toni&s;h|ing in&s;tinct of animals, which in many of them bears a &s;trong affinity to the boa&s;ted rea&s;on of man, gave him a high idea of their rights, and a thorough conviction of the moral obligation man is under to treat all animals with tenderne&s;s. His humanity was
<PB N="65" REF="025609_0063_0FCE10708DF950F8">
therefore tran&s;ferred to them on all occa|&s;ions. The &s;ervices of the laboring cattle he would reward by ample refre&s;hments and gentle u&s;age. The &s;trong and greedy he would re&s;train from oppre&s;&s;ing and injuring the weak and timid. Such was his tender|ne&s;s to animals that he would not &s;uffer the little birds that re&s;orted to his yard through di&s;tre&s;s of weather, to be mole&s;ted or injured. He e&s;teemed it a gro&s;s violation of the laws of ho&s;pitality to take advantage of the confi|dence they placed in him by taking &s;helter under his wing.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular mark of barbarity in man that he &s;hould perfidiou&s;ly take the advan|tage of the great and affecting di&s;tre&s;s which has induced the&s;e poor innocent birds to come and a&s;k of him that &s;canty pittance of grain and &s;eeds, which but for them would be lo&s;t; and murder them for pre&s;uming &s;o far on his clemency. The following affect|ing anecdote &s;hows both the cruelty and im|policy of it:&mdash;"Mr.<GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">, one of the mo&s;t famous and extraordinary farmers that has ever done honor to the &s;tate of Connecticut, by his timely and humane a&s;&s;i&s;tance in a hard winter, &s;aved the quails from being entirely de&s;troyed.

Every farmer who will u&s;e the &s;ame humanity, and be at a little pains to cheri&s;h the little birds that hover around him in winter, will find him&s;elf rewarded for his trouble by their various notes in &s;pring.</P>
<P>The various warblings of the birds which have &s;urvived the &s;everities of our climate, or returned from milder regions to &s;erenade us with the return of &s;pring, &s;urpa&s;&s;es de&s;|cription. The plea&s;ure which their tuneful notes afford an attentive ear, is thus beauti|fully de&s;cribed by an enlightened American farmer:&mdash;"I generally ri&s;e from my bed about that indi&s;tinct interval, which, properly &s;peaking, is neither night nor day; for this is the moment of the mo&s;t univer&s;al vocal choir.

in the con&s;truction of their ne&s;ts, ill provided as we may &s;uppo&s;e them to be with proper tools, their neatne&s;s, their convenience, al|ways make me a&s;hamed of the &s;lovenline&s;s of our hou&s;es. Their love to their dame, their ince&s;&s;ant careful attention, and the peculiar &s;ongs they addre&s;s to her while &s;he tediou&s;ly incubates, or &s;its upon their eggs, reminds me of my duty, could I ever forget it. Their affection to their helple&s;s little ones, is a lively precept; and, in &s;hort, the whole economy of what we proudly call the brute creation, is admirable in every circum&s;tance; and vain man, though adorned with the ad|ditional gift of rea&s;on, might learn from the perfection of in&s;tinct, how to regulate the fol|lies, and how to temper the errors which this &s;econd gift often makes them commit. This is a &s;ubject on which I have often be|&s;towed the mo&s;t &s;erious thoughts. I have often blu&s;hed within my&s;elf, and been greatly a&s;toni&s;hed, when I have compared the uner|ring path they all follow, all ju&s;t, all proper, all wi&s;e, up to the nece&s;&s;ary degree of per|fection, with the coar&s;e, the imperfect &s;y&s;|tems of men, not merely as governors and kings, but as ma&s;ters, as hu&s;bands, as fathers, as citizens. If ever man was permitted to receive and enjoy &s;ome ble&s;&s;ings that might

alleviate the many &s;orrows to which he is expo&s;ed, it is certainly in the country, when he attentively con&s;iders the&s;e ravi&s;hing &s;cenes with which he is every where &s;urrounded."</P>
<P>Few men who have devoted their time to labor, have di&s;covered a more contemplative turn of mind than Mr. Worthy. Indeed, it is too much the ca&s;e that men who labor on the earth, do not endeavor to &s;oar &s;uffi|ciently above it in their minds, though the wonders they every day behold might excite u&s;eful thoughts and reflections, did they prop|erly attend to them: To the&s;e Mr. Wor|thy was particularly attentive; and the plea&s;|ure he derived from the many wonderful things which his occupation led him to ob|&s;erve in the natural world, was very great. Be&s;ides the moral u&s;es and advantages he de|rived from his ob&s;ervations on the operations of nature, they a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in making prog|re&s;s in his bu&s;ine&s;s as a farmer. But his at|tention began now to be called to the educa|tion of his children. He con&s;idered them, as committed to his care for in&s;truction as well as provi&s;ion for their &s;upport; and that he was an&s;werable before him who gave them, for the di&s;charge of his duty, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;werable for their future char|acter.
<PB N="69" REF="025609_0067_0FCE10798F5E6AF0">
Being deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e &s;entiments, he watched with all parental attention the gradual unfolding of their rea|&s;on, and &s;tudied their different tempers with great care. For their little faults he would contrive little puni&s;hments, and &s;mall en|couragements for their good actions, with a variety of expedients dictated by the occa|&s;ion. The country being thinly &s;ettled, it was &s;ome years before they could enjoy the benefit of a &s;chool. Mr. Worthy was under the nece&s;&s;ity therefore of a&s;&s;i&s;ting his wife in teaching them to read, which he faithfully attended to, though the improvement of his farm and the variety of his bu&s;ine&s;s called him con&s;tantly to attend to other things. But he was at length relieved from this by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;chool in the town, for which he had been long &s;triving.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy reflection that &s;o little care is taken of the ri&s;ing generation in many of our new &s;ettlements. Many, it is to be feared, grow up literally "like the wild a&s;&s;es colt." This is laying a wretched foundation for the &s;ettlement of a new country. Re|mote from the power of good example, and the check of &s;hame, they too often partake of the wildne&s;s of the fore&s;t; and of the
<PB N="70" REF="025609_0068_0FCE107B0C5F7330">
di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of men unre&s;trained by religion, by law, or by the opinion of others. In this &s;ituation men are apt to become turbu|lent and factious. Ignorance and its de|&s;tructive attendants follow in gloomy train, and render a &s;ettlement wretched, which with due cultivation might have been flouri&s;hing and happy. Where the means of knowl|edge are neglected, and the ri&s;ing genera|tion grow up in ignorance, the means of re|ligion are u&s;ually neglected al&s;o. Where this is the ca&s;e, men pre&s;ently become rude in their manners, as well as vicious in their prac|tice. It is an undoubted truth, that the forms of public wor&s;hip regularly and decently at|tended, have a mo&s;t happy effect in civiliz|ing &s;ociety, as well as in cheri&s;hing devo|tion in the minds of pious men. Mr. Wor|thy was &s;o fully convinced of this that he did not &s;pare any expen&s;e or exertions in his power to induce tho&s;e about him to unite their efforts to erect a hou&s;e for public wor|&s;hip, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a mini&s;ter among them. This was effected after &s;ome time; and Mr. Worthy found him&s;elf very happy in being able to accompany his wife and little family &s;teadily to the duties of public devotion. How did his heart &s;well with joy to &s;ee the

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Timothy Puffum turns trader&mdash;his ruin.&mdash;Story of the Sloth and the Beaver of North and South America.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE things were going on thus pro&s;perou&s;ly with Worthy, and he was en|joying with his wife the peaceful fruits of virtuous and indu&s;trious lives, the ca&s;e was very different with Timothy Puffum. The way in which this young man had been &s;uffered to grow up has already been related, and the e&s;tate which fell into his hands at the death of his father. The farm which came to him in good order, &s;oon began to go out of repair, and as he had not been brought up to labor, nor even to the knowledge of any bu&s;ine&s;s, he knew not by what means to put it into order. Tho&s;e who under&s;tand the lea&s;t of bu&s;ine&s;s them&s;elves are the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome to do bu&s;ine&s;s for; and are mo&s;t apt to be peevi&s;h and fretful at tho&s;e whom they employ. This was the ca&s;e with young Mr. Puffum. Having the common di&s;ea&s;e of tho&s;e who have very little acquaintance with the affairs of hu&s;bandry, he conceited
<PB N="73" REF="025609_0071_0FCE10810FABBFD0">
he was ma&s;ter of the bu&s;ine&s;s; and being humored in every thing when he was a boy, he was &s;o peevi&s;h and ill humored that there was no plea&s;ing of him. He carried this to &s;o great a length, finding fault and quarreling with his workmen, that it became difficult for him to hire laborers. It was on this ac|count that Hodge, a faithful man who had the care of his farm, left him; and he was obliged to &s;ell &s;ome of his &s;tock to pay the arrears of wages due to Hodge, and to &s;ettle with the dairy woman, who left him on the &s;ame account. So that his affairs were in a wor&s;e train than ever.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance that ha&s;tened his ruin very much, was his marriage with a vain young girl of no good character, and who had nothing to recommend her but a tolerable out&s;ide figure, of which &s;he was &s;ufficiently vain, and cared for little el&s;e but dre&s;s and amu&s;ement. He was obliged to make &s;ale frequently of &s;tock and other things to gratify her gay fancy. His embarra&s;&s;ments became &s;o great after a while that he &s;carcely knew which way to turn him&s;elf. At length he thought of a plan to get rid of all his diffi|culties, and to put him&s;elf into a fine way of living. He &s;aw others flouri&s;h and pro&s;per in trade, and thought it an ea&s;y thing to get
<PB N="74" REF="025609_0072_0FCE1082AD228508">
a genteel living without any trouble. This was very plea&s;ing to his wife. She thought this was a great deal more better way than to be nothing but farmers, and to be obliged to work. Then, &s;aid &s;he, we can get every thing we want without paying for it, and how much more cleaverer that will be than to have to go to the &s;hops to lay out our money, and then have to &s;ell &s;omething or other to pay for it. Oh! I wi&s;h we had them now. I am tired of this dull poor way of &s;crubbing along. I hope you will get a good parcel of the mo&s;t fine&s;t ribbons and fathars &s;o that a body can have eno of them. The&s;e is the be&s;t things to &s;ell, for I want a good many now."&mdash;A fine cu&s;tomer indeed!</P>
<P>But Mr. Puffum did not need much per|&s;uading. He was therefore ea&s;ily induced to go and contract with a merchant for a quantity of goods, for the payment of which he pledged his farm. But what can he do with a &s;hop of goods, who could not take care of the affairs of a farm? He was unacquainted with accounts, and knew not either the qual|ity or value of goods, nor did he con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of being punctual in his pay|ments, but grew more carele&s;s and ex|travagant than before. He and his wife were their own &s;teadie&s;t cu&s;tomers, and were
<PB N="75" REF="025609_0073_0FCE1086C6E0A2A8">
every day con&s;uming their farm without perceiving it; and it was not long before dre&s;s, company and frolics had wa&s;ted the goods he had been entru&s;ted with, and not much payment made for them. The debt &s;till hung over him. He had no way to rai&s;e money to di&s;charge it, but by &s;elling his farm, which he was obliged to do at a great di&s;advantage, &s;o that it would not pay the debt. All their fine pro&s;pects were now at an end, and they had no means of living left them, but were reduced to extreme poverty and di&s;tre&s;s. He had no re&s;ource within him&s;elf, was not accu&s;tomed to labor, and was habituated to idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation. To their other di&s;tre&s;&s;es they added that of &s;trife and contention. They accu&s;ed each other as being the cau&s;e of all the evils that they now labored under. But this only made a bad matter wor&s;e. After living &s;ome time in this dreadful &s;ituation, he turned hor&s;e-jockey. Intemperance and gaming followed. Being poor and vicious, he become friendle&s;s and wretched. He continued in the prac|tice of many ruinous and di&s;graceful vices, till at length he died mi&s;erably in a loath|&s;ome jail.</P>
<P>The&s;e effects of idlene&s;s, extravagance and folly, may be u&s;efully contra&s;ted with

indu&s;try, in the following &s;tory, with which I &s;hall conclude this chapter. The Sloth is an animal of South America, and is &s;o ill formed for motion that a few paces are often the journey of a week, and &s;o indi&s;po&s;ed to move, that he never changes his place but when impelled by the &s;evere&s;t &s;tings of hun|ger. He lives upon the leaves, fruit and flowers of trees, and often on the bark it&s;elf, when nothing be&s;ides is left for his &s;u&s;te|nance. As a large quantity of food is nece&s;|&s;ary for his &s;upport, he generally &s;trips a tree of all its verdure in le&s;s than a fortnight; and being then de&s;titute of food, he drops down like a lifele&s;s ma&s;s, from the branches to the ground. After remaining torpid or &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;ometime, from the &s;hock received by the fall, he prepares for a journey to &s;ome neighboring tree, to which he crawls &s;o &s;lowly that his motion can hardly be perceived. When he has arrived, he a&s;cends the tree, and being half &s;tarved, &s;oon devours what|ever the branches afford. By con&s;uming the bark, he &s;oon de&s;troys the life of the tree; and thus the &s;ource from which his &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence is derived, is lo&s;t, and he has nothing le&s;t to &s;upport him. Such is the mi&s;erable &s;tate of this &s;lothful animal. How different are the comforts and enjoyments of the in|du&s;trious

In the months of June and July the Beavers a&s;&s;emble and form a &s;ociety, which generally con&s;i&s;ts of more than two hundred. They always fix their abode by the &s;ide of a lake or river; and in order to make a dead water, they erect, with incredible labor, a dam, per|haps eighty or a hundred feet long, and ten or twelve feet thick at the bottom. When this dike or dam is completed, they build their &s;everal apartments, which are divided into three &s;tories. The fir&s;t is below the level of the mole, and is for the mo&s;t part full of water. The walls of their habitations are perpendicular, and about two feet thick. If any wood project from them, they cut it off with their teeth, which are more &s;ervice|able than &s;aws; and by the help of their tails, they plai&s;ter all their work with a kind of mortar, which they prepare of dry gra&s;s and clay mixed together. In Augu&s;t or September, they begin to lay up their &s;tores of food; which con&s;i&s;ts of the wood of the birch, the plane, and of &s;ome other trees.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of Mrs. Worthy&mdash;Of old Mrs. Grudges, and her envious and ill natured &s;peeches.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO I have &s;aid but little of Mrs. Worthy; but as &s;he is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to bear an important part in the management of his dome&s;tic affairs, I think a more particu|lar account of her character and management, nece&s;&s;ary to this hi&s;tory. What has already been related &s;hows her wi&s;dom in the choice of a hu&s;band; for while Mr. Puffum, and his fooli&s;h vain wife, were &s;quandering away an e&s;tate in idlene&s;s and vanity, Mr. and Mrs. Worthy were reaping the fruits of their indu&s;try and economy in the increa&s;e of their e&s;tate, and in the peace and tranquillity of their hou&s;e. They &s;aw new beauties every day in their children, and had the &s;at|i&s;faction of &s;eeing that their care and in|&s;truction were not lo&s;t upon them, but be|&s;towed to good purpo&s;e. Mrs. Worthy agreed with her hu&s;band in the general plan of educating their children, which made this important branch of duty go on with more ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="025609_0078_0FCE1090CD2EADF8">
In the per&s;onal appearance of Mrs. Worthy there was &s;omething extremely plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting. It was &s;uch as made impre&s;|&s;ions favorable to her character at fir&s;t view, and gave you the idea of a re&s;pectable coun|try gentlewoman. Her countenance was the index of a cheerful, mode&s;t, contented mind. It be&s;poke the &s;en&s;ibility and benev|olence of her heart. Such indeed was her character. Tho &s;he had many difficulties to grapple with at their fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world, yet &s;he was always cheerful, and never repined at any thing. Some will make a bad matter wor&s;e by fretting, and &s;o create many unnece&s;&s;ary evils by refu&s;ing to be patient under tho&s;e which are unavoidable: and will not enjoy any thing becau&s;e they cannot have every thing. But Mrs. Wor|thy had more prudence and goodne&s;s than thus to di&s;turb her own, and her hu&s;band's peace of mind. Indeed &s;he had &s;uch an example of it in her neighbor, Mrs. Grudges, and of the ill effects of it in their family, that this, if nothing el&s;e, was enough to make her &s;ick of it. But Mrs. Worthy would often &s;ay&mdash;" If I can di&s;charge my duty, I am not anxious about my condition, nor do I think it worth while to pine for what I have not, &s;ince I have enough to &s;ati&s;fy all
<PB N="81" REF="025609_0079_0FCE10924D271C78">
my real wants, and doubt not but by our indu&s;try and prudence we &s;hall have things comfortable about us after a while."</P>
<P>She was a per&s;on of great &s;en&s;ibility, and took great plea&s;ure in helping the poor and needy. Touched with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, &s;he would &s;pare no pains to relieve them. She would go by day and by night among her &s;ick and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed neighbors. The poor|er &s;ort of them often experienced the effects of her benevolent heart in their &s;ickne&s;s, by the comfortable things &s;he would prepare and carry to them, for &s;he never went among them on &s;uch occa&s;ions bare handed. In this re&s;pect &s;he was a ble&s;&s;ing highly to be prized. How much does &s;uch a neighbor, who is kind and helpful, contribute to lighten the burden of life, and to promote its enjoy|ment? Such was the conduct of Mrs. Wor|thy, that all the neighbors who had any grat|itude were loud in her prai&s;e. There are &s;ome to be found in mo&s;t places who have envious di&s;po&s;itions, who cannot bear to &s;ee others pro&s;per, nor to hear them &s;poken well of. They &s;eem to think it is a reflection upon them&s;elves, and therefore will &s;ay hard things of them. This was remarkably the ca&s;e with their neighbor Grudges, whom I had occa&s;ion to mention before. She was not
<PB N="82" REF="025609_0080_0FCE1094228C0A38">
fretful, but envious to a great degree, and indeed I am inclined to think that they both proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e. This old vi|rago would always rail at Mrs. Worthy whenever &s;he heard others &s;peaking in her prai&s;e. "For my part, &s;he would &s;ay, I don't know as how &s;he's any better than &s;ome other foks. Some people loves to go galloping about from one place to another, &s;o they can get a little prai&s;e, but others are obliged to &s;tay to home, and keep to work. For my part I an't agoing to &s;ay nothing about any nabors. She may be well enough and good enough&mdash;but then&mdash;I know what I know." The&s;e oblique hints and flings are no uncommon things among envious and re&s;tle&s;s people. They are like dark clouds that only &s;how their grim edge above the horizon when they &s;end forth di&s;tant fla&s;hes of lightning, and muttering thunder. Her &s;peeches had no more effect on Mrs. Worthy, than &s;uch di&s;tant thunder has on our &s;pirits. Whenever &s;he heard of Mrs. Grudge's fooli&s;h talk (and there are tale bearers enough in every place to carry &s;uch intelligence) &s;he would only reply that "She was but doing her duty in endeav|oring to &s;erve her neighbors, and the more good it was in her power to do them, the

better and happier &s;he felt. Mrs. Worthy's goodne&s;s was not to be re&s;trained, or divert|ed, by the folly of this ill humored woman, for when &s;he fell &s;ick of a fever and &s;tood in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her neighbors, Mrs. Worthy was among the fir&s;t to vi&s;it her, and to do every thing &s;he could for her relief and comfort. This was rendering good for evil, and heaping coals of fire upon her head, which was the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible retaliation. By this kind of revenge, we gain the mo&s;t effec|tual and mo&s;t honorable conque&s;t over our adver&s;aries.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Further account of Mrs. Worthy&mdash;Of Mrs. Straton&mdash;Anecdote of her.&mdash;Of Mrs. Har|ris&mdash;A wi&s;e ob&s;ervation of her's.</HEAD>
<P>IF we now take a view of Mrs. Wor|thy's dome&s;tic character, we &s;hall find that her kind and obliging manners abroad were not the effects of o&s;tentation, nor a de&s;ire to gain a character abroad that &s;he did not &s;up|port at home. This is too often the ca&s;e both with men and women. They &s;how their good or ill breeding abroad, but their good or ill nature they &s;how at home. She was indeed one of Solomon's virtuous wives, who&s;e excellencies he beautifully de&s;cribes in the thirty fir&s;t chapter of Proverbs. "She looked well to the ways of her hou&s;e|hold, and did not eat the bread of idlene&s;s. Her children ro&s;e up and called her ble&s;&s;ed; her hu&s;band al&s;o, and he prai&s;ed her." Mr. Worthy was the happy man who found the ine&s;timable prize which royal wi&s;dom &s;ays "is above rubies." He had &s;en&s;e enough to di&s;cern it, and goodne&s;s enough to acknowledge it too, which is not always the
<PB N="85" REF="025609_0083_0FCE10989F66BDF8">
ca&s;e with men who have good wives. Mrs. Worthy carried cleanline&s;s to the highe&s;t pitch. She was of a very oppo&s;ite opinion to tho&s;e who &s;ay that &s;luts make the be&s;t butter. Every thing was in place&mdash;no con|fu&s;ion&mdash;no di&s;order; every thing was bright and clean. This nice method and arrange|ment in her hou&s;e enabled her to go on with her bu&s;ine&s;s to the be&s;t advantage. The want of this method is the occa&s;ion of that hurly burly and confu&s;ion which we &s;ee in &s;ome hou&s;es. There was an extraordinary in&s;tance of it in Mrs. Straton's hou&s;e. Here every thing was out of place, and the hou&s;e up in arms. It was in all re&s;pects a contra&s;t to Mrs. Worthy's.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of her per&s;on, becau&s;e it had become &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting to her hu&s;band on account of her carele&s;s, &s;lutti&s;h appear|ance. Before marriage her out&s;ide appear|ance was as good as any one in the circle of her acquaintance; but after marriage, &s;he grew very carele&s;s about her per&s;on, and from that to downright &s;lutti&s;hne&s;s. This is a very imprudent thing in a female, be|cau&s;e it digu&s;ts the man who&s;e affections and e&s;teem &s;he &s;hould always &s;tudy to pre&s;erve; and by pre&s;erving them, &s;he &s;ecures an in|fluence over him which &s;he can't acquire by
<PB N="86" REF="025609_0084_0FCE109A0E37F420">
any other means. There are many in&s;tan|ces of men being driven to taverns, and ex|ce&s;&s;es, which they never would have gone into, had they not found their own hou&s;es become &s;o di&s;agreeable to them through the imprudence of their wives. This was not the ca&s;e, indeed, with Mrs. Straton's hu&s;|band. He was a man of too much virtue, and had too much regard for his children to give way to the&s;e vices. But it was always a &s;ore mortification to him that his wife was &s;uch a &s;lattern. A friend of his called upon him one day when he was ab&s;ent from home. Mrs. Straton came to the door in her u&s;ual di&s;habille. Though well acquainted with her hu&s;band, he had no knowledge of her, and &s;uppo&s;ing her to be the &s;ervant maid, he a&s;ked her if Mr. Straton was at home. She &s;aid he was not. "Will you de&s;ire Mrs. Straton to come to the door?" &s;aid the gentleman. "I am &s;he, in&s;tead of a bet|ter," replied Mrs. Straton, with an aukward curte&s;y. Her per&s;onal appearance was a true picture of the hou&s;e within. Here every thing was at &s;ixes and &s;evens. Her kitchen and parlour were nearly akin to the earth, and all things were of a piece. It was her mi&s;fortune that &s;he had not been trained to neatne&s;s when a child, nor accu&s;tomed to
<PB N="87" REF="025609_0085_0FCE109B6676BDA0">
order and method when young. In that gay period, her out&s;ide appearance was as her hou&s;e now is, painted without, but un|clean within. Her dairy room<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Deane, in his excellent treati&s;e on hu&s;bandry, entitled "The New England Farmer," has given &s;ome di|rections on this head, which are worthy the attention of all farmers. The occupation of making butter and chee&s;e from milk, he ju&s;tly con&s;iders as a critical part of the farm|er's bu&s;ine&s;s: and that unle&s;s his wife or hou&s;e keeper is very diligent and indu&s;trious, and &s;ees minutely to the dairy her|&s;elf, it will prove unprofitable. The cows mu&s;t be milked at an early hour, and the utmo&s;t cleanline&s;s ob&s;erved. In order to pre&s;erve the temperature of the air in the dairy room, our ingenious author ob&s;erves, "A room in the cellar may be kept &s;o nearly of an equal coolne&s;s, that the milk will neither grow &s;our in &s;ummer nor freeze in winter; &s;o that nothing will ob&s;truct the ri&s;ing of the cream. There &s;hould be win|dows on the northern &s;ide. The&s;e &s;hould be opened in the coole&s;t of the mornings in &s;ummer to let in fre&s;h air. The room &s;hould be plai&s;tered and whitewa&s;hed, to increa&s;e the light and prevent in&s;ects. Every part &s;hould be extremely clear and &s;weet, and nothing &s;hould enter into it which can corrupt the air."</NOTE> was of a piece with the re&s;t, and almo&s;t &s;poiled what|ever was put into it. Her hu&s;band kept a large number of cows, but could have but lit|tle benefit from them, as the mo&s;t of whatever went into the hou&s;e was &s;quandered away and lo&s;t. Her hu&s;band would &s;ometimes complain that he had not as much butter and chee&s;e for market as &s;ome of his neighbors who had fewer cows. This would &s;et her

&s;colding at the children and maid for wa&s;t|ing the milk and butter. Her children were dirty and ragged. They were taught noth|ing but by hard blows. Their meals were never regular, and &s;eldom in &s;ea&s;on, and when brought on table, they appeared fitter for &s;ome other kind of animals than for ra|tional creatures.</P>
<P>I will now turn from &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting a &s;ight to a character more de&s;erving attention. Mrs. Harris, a native of Ireland, came over with her parents when quite young. Her parents acquired a decent living in the we&s;|tern part of New Jer&s;ey, where they &s;ettled at their fir&s;t coming over. They were good &s;ort of people, and endeavored to bring up Nelle, their only daughter, as well as they po&s;&s;ibly could. At the age of about two and twenty, &s;he married Mr. J. Harris, a wealthy farmer in New England, and was remarkable for good management. It was a maxim with her, that "to know the true character of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, you mu&s;t go into her garret and cellar." This worthy woman lived to a great age, an example of piety to her maker, of good order in her affairs, and of kindne&s;s to her fellow creatures. She lived much re&s;pected, and died greatly la|mented by all who knew her.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="025609_0087_0FCE109E4D2A6068">
Mrs. Worthy practi&s;ed upon Mrs. Har|ris's maxim, and was never a&s;hamed to have any part of her hou&s;e vi&s;ited by the be&s;t judges of good economy and cleanline&s;s at all times. Nor was &s;he a&s;hamed to appear if her friends called &s;uddenly upon her at any time. Her dre&s;s was always neat though plain, and indeed &s;he gloried in being dre&s;|&s;ed in the manufacture of her own hands. I &s;hall re&s;erve for the next chapter an ac|count of an incident which repre&s;ented her in an amiable point of light, and brought to view many good qualities which were well de&s;|cribed in a letter to a friend.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. A vi&s;it from a &s;tranger&mdash;Mr. Worthy's ac|count of his finding honey in the woods&mdash;Fable of the Bear and Bees.</HEAD>
<P>ON a certain day when the &s;un &s;hone with uncommon brightne&s;s, and every thing &s;eemed placid and &s;erene, a &s;tranger rode up to the door and di&s;mounted. Mr. Worthy was in the field attending to his bu&s;ine&s;s there. Mrs. Worthy was employed at the &s;ame time about her dairy, and was dre&s;&s;ed &s;uitably to her employment. The gentle|man who was well dre&s;t, knocked at the door, but without waiting for any ceremony, went in, and ob&s;erving the door open that led into the kitchen, he went directly for that. Here he found Mrs. Worthy engaged in the em|ployment ju&s;t mentioned. Such a vi&s;itor coming in &s;o unexpectedly, and quite a &s;tranger, &s;eemed a little to di&s;concert and embarra&s;s her at fir&s;t, for &s;he was a very mode&s;t woman. However, &s;he &s;oon recol|lected her&s;elf, and con&s;idered that &s;he was do|ing her duty, and was dre&s;t in character;

and &s;aid to the gentleman, who inquired af|ter Mr. Worthy, "if you will plea&s;e to walk into the other room, &s;ir, I will &s;end for Mr. Worthy, who is not far off," and told Dilla, her maid, to &s;how the gentleman to the par|lour. "If you plea&s;e, Madam, &s;aid he, I will &s;it here a little while, your kitchen is clean enough for me, and I have a curio&s;ity to &s;ee the operation of this bu&s;ine&s;s, for I have never &s;een a chee&s;e made in my life."</P>
<P>Mrs. Worthy went on with her work, and he &s;at till &s;he had completed it, a&s;king many que&s;tions about it without di&s;covering his name, and &s;he had too much mode&s;ty and good breeding to a&s;k<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The practice of a&s;king &s;trangers their names is &s;aid to&punc; be peculiar to New England; and it is the &s;ubject of much&punc; ridicule among foreigners&mdash;who are probably guilty of &s;ome other practices as ridiculous.</NOTE> it of him. At length he &s;aid to her "I perceive Madam, that I am quite a &s;tranger to you; but as I am about to purcha&s;e a farm, that I may retire from the noi&s;e and hurry of the town, I have made a journey to this part of the country, of which we hear great fame; and as far as I have &s;een, I think it an&s;wers the de&s;cription given of it. I have called to take advice of Mr. Worthy, and hope to have the happine&s;s to live not far from you." She could not all this time di&s;cover who he was.
<PB N="92" REF="025609_0090_0FCE10A3F38FC4A0">
She again de&s;ired him to walk into the other room, which he did; and &s;tepping into an adjoining room, &s;he adju&s;ted her clothes, and &s;oon appeared with great propriety. He then inquired whether &s;he did not re|collect a di&s;tant relation of her father who lived at <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">, who was the bearer of the let|ter by which they received the fir&s;t account of her brother's being wounded in an action with the Indians, and on the recovery. Mrs. Worthy replied that "&s;he remembered it perfectly well, and never &s;hould forget the joy which was &s;pread through the hou&s;e on that occa&s;ion; and that &s;he now recollected him by the &s;car in his forehead, which he had received in the early part of that cam|paign." A number of years, which alters every thing, had pa&s;&s;ed over &s;ince that time, and Mrs. Worthy had no other knowl|edge of him afterwards except that &s;he had heard that he was a merchant of &s;ome di&s;|tinction at <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">. After expre&s;&s;ing her plea|&s;ure at &s;eeing him again, and mutual inqui|ries after each others' welfare, he propo&s;ed to take a view of her hou&s;e if it was agreeable, &s;aying, "he perceived they had gotten things well about them." There are few women who could conduct with more dignity on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. She &s;eemed con&s;cious
<PB N="93" REF="025609_0091_0FCE10A840155108">
that there could not be any thing in the plain &s;tile of their hou&s;e that could gratify the ta&s;te of a per&s;on of his figure, but with|out making any apologies, which the weak|ne&s;s of pride often dictates, &s;he calmly told him "that they had nothing but what was in a farmer's &s;tile, and if it would be any gratification to him &s;he would with plea&s;ure go over the hou&s;e and &s;how him the few con|veniencies they enjoyed." When they had gone through, and returned to the &s;itting room, he gave Mrs. Worthy high applau&s;e for the order, &s;implicity and neatne&s;s which appeared through the whole; and was de|lighted with the many conveniences which Mr. Worthy's ingenuity had added to his hou&s;e. Mrs. Worthy ob&s;erved to him "that as to wine they did not pretend to it; but that &s;he could give him &s;ome mead, of her own make, from the honey of bees which Mr. Worthy had taken in the woods. He accepted a little of it, and declared to her that he thought it the fine&s;t he had ever ta&s;ted in his life. Mr. Worthy happening to come in at this time, and being introduc|ed by Mrs. Worthy to Mr. Blanford, for that was his name, the conver&s;ation turned on other &s;ubjects for a while. But Mr. Blanford, who had been a&s;ked to renew his
<PB N="94" REF="025609_0092_0FCE10A998250BA8">
draught of the mead, inquired how it was made, and in what manner the honey was taken of which it was made. Mr. Worthy cited him to his wife for an account of the manner of making the mead; and gave him the following account of the manner in which he took the bees in the woods.</P>
<P>"At the time when the cells are fulle&s;t of honey, I prepare the nece&s;&s;ary material for di&s;covering their retreat, and gathering their rich and u&s;eful &s;tores, which are much more profitable than is generally thought for; and though fatiguing, yet I am commonly rewarded for my labor. Be&s;ides the provi&s;ion I carry for my own u&s;e, and a &s;mall pocket compa&s;s to direct my cour&s;e, I take with me &s;ome wax and honey. With the&s;e articles I go into the woods, where I generally di&s;|cover &s;ome bees in motion. I ob&s;erve the cour&s;e they &s;teer, and follow them; and &s;ometimes di&s;cover their lodgment in this way, among large old trees. If I &s;ee no bees, I endeavor to draw their attention to me by burning &s;ome wax on a hot &s;tone; the fla|vor of the wax will &s;oon bring a number of them together. When the&s;e have loaded them&s;elves they fly off to make a depo&s;it of what they have gathered. They return for more, and &s;o on till they have taken all the
<PB N="95" REF="025609_0093_0FCE10AD537AADD8">
bait I have laid for them. I am particu|lar in ob&s;erving their different cour&s;es; and by the&s;e means I &s;eldom fail of finding their &s;tore hou&s;es. Thus I &s;ometimes find &s;everal &s;warms in one excur&s;ion, and mark the trees which contain them, that I may return home, and bring proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance for conveying the honey to my own hou&s;e. The quantity, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, that is contained in &s;ome of the&s;e large limbs, or trunks of trees, is truly a&s;toni&s;hing, and leaves me no doubt but this is the mo&s;t profitable game our farm|ers can hunt for, who live near to the woods. To &s;hew you, continued he, the prolific and beneficial effects of this little indu&s;trious creature, I can a&s;&s;ure you that the fir&s;t &s;warm I ever found in the woods was by accident, in the month of April, in a large hollow limb, which I &s;awed off and placed it in the &s;ame po&s;ition at home, and from that I had five &s;warms that year."</P>
<P>Mr. Blanford was plea&s;ed with this ac|count, and ob&s;erved that tho man was able by &s;tratagem, to detect them in their retreat, yet that the indu&s;try, good order and &s;ubordi|nation of the bees were admonitions to man for his di&s;po&s;ition to idlene&s;s, and his inat|tention to order and regularity at home, and his want of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government
<PB N="96" REF="025609_0094_0FCE10AF285E59C0">
abroad. But, like man, continued Mr. Blanford, they are liable to be corrupted, and become indolent when placed in a &s;itu|ation where indu&s;try is not nece&s;&s;ary to their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>He then related the &s;tory of "A Dutch merchant who was &s;ettled at Batavia, a large and flouri&s;hing town in the i&s;land of Java, and the capital of all the Dutch &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t Indies. This gentleman &s;ent for a hive of young bees from Poland, a king|dom far to the northward, to this warm and fertile place. This he did with a view to multiply the breed of this indu&s;trious in&s;ect, and regale him&s;elf with honey prepared un|der his own in&s;pection. The bees were placed in a large and beautiful garden, fur|ni&s;hed with the riche&s;t profu&s;ion of fragrant herbs and flowers. Plenty &s;oon corrupted their di&s;po&s;ition to labor, and the &s;tock of honey which they collected, during the fir&s;t months of their &s;ettlement, was of little value.&mdash;The expected winter did not en&s;ue, and as they continued to enjoy abundance in this happy climate, they became improvi|dent of futurity, and were no longer at pains to &s;tore their cells with that food which bountiful nature at all &s;ea&s;ons provided for them. Thus unfavorable was exce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="97" REF="025609_0095_0FCE10B055173B20">
abundance to the admired virtues of the bee. And no le&s;s injurious to many a well form|ed youth, is that affluence which hath been heaped together by parental toil, to gratify parental ambition; but which &s;erves either to nouri&s;h &s;loth, by &s;uper&s;eding the nece&s;|&s;ity of application; or to promote di&s;&s;ipa|pation and profligacy of manners, by giving a fal&s;e direction to activity." The danger of this, Mr. Blanford a&s;&s;ured Mrs. Worthy, was with him a very powerful rea&s;on for wi&s;hing to retire from a great and luxurious town, to the enjoyment of the more innocent and peaceful plea&s;ures of a country life. This gentleman was &s;o plea&s;ed with what he &s;aw at Mr. Worthy's, that he gave a partic|ular de&s;cription of it in a letter to his friend, which &s;hall appear in the next chapter.</P>

<P>WHEN Mr. Blanford had accom|pli&s;hed his purpo&s;e in calling on Mr. Wor|thy, he took his leave of the family, with many thanks for their civilities, and return|ed home. Soon after his return, he wrote a very de&s;criptive letter to a friend of his, who had ridiculed his idea of exchanging the plea&s;ures of the city for tho&s;e of the coun|try. This letter contains &s;o many u&s;eful ob&s;ervations and &s;entiments, as to merit a place here, notwith&s;tanding his going into many minute circum&s;tances that may not appear of importance.</P>

<P>The neatne&s;s of Mrs. Worthy's per&s;on was but a &s;ample of the neatne&s;s of her hou&s;e. Such order and regularity in the family,

&s;uch clean floors and uten&s;ils, &s;uch fragrance through the hou&s;e, from the fre&s;h flowers which decorated the chimnies, and from the neighboring fields, which were now in a high &s;tate of cultivation, made me in love with a farmer's life, and confirmed me in my re&s;o|lutions &s;oon to enjoy it. I am &s;o charmed with Mrs. Worthy's economy and good hou&s;ewifry, that I am tempted to give you a particular account of the hou&s;e and furniture.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy's hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of a com|modious kitchen, with a good pantry and wa&s;h hou&s;e adjoining, and an excellent dairy room. The parlour was a neat mid|dle &s;ized room. The dining, or family room, was large and convenient, ceiled up at the &s;ides, and ornamented with clean white ta|bles, and with chairs bottomed with the in|ner bark of elm, which Mr. Worthy in|formed me was more durable than flag. The cupboard, which was filled with the common uten&s;ils of the family, was plain, but clean. The kitchen, with every thing in it, appeared clean as our parlours. Her be&s;t room was as plea&s;ant as it was neat. The two windows, that looked into the gar|den, were ornamented on the out&s;ide with a honey&s;uckle, a &s;weetbrier, a ro&s;e tree and a je&s;&s;amine. The curtains were of a hand|&s;ome

red and white check, which Mrs. Wor|thy had made in the hou&s;e. The &s;hovel, tongs and handirons, were all of a piece with the re&s;t. Under the window &s;tood a large maple table, which for its bright poli&s;h re|&s;embled the looking gla&s;s which hung over it. On the other &s;ide was a cane couch, with cu&s;hions of patch work, made out of the bits which Mrs. Worthy had &s;ewed toge|ther while &s;he was young, and &s;ix chairs of the &s;ame kind. Several cheap prints hung round the room. Mr. Worthy was of opinion that the heart might be more or le&s;s affected by them. He therefore had procured tho&s;e that repre&s;ented our Saviour's birth and pa&s;&s;ion, the prodigal &s;on, &amp;c. In the other room he had the indu&s;trious apprentice, and pictures repre&s;enting &s;heep-&s;hearing, a farm yard and a harve&s;t field. The&s;e &s;erved at lea&s;t for amu&s;ement to the children. The parlour chamber was much in the &s;ame &s;tile of the parlour, with the ad|dition of a bed of furniture check. There was no toilet at which our ladies &s;pend &s;o much of their time, but a little white table covered with a napkin. The other cham|bers contained nothing worthy of notice, except the plain neatne&s;s that appeared there.</P>

You will, my dear &s;ir, naturally expect me to a&s;cend from the&s;e le&s;s important mat|ters to Mrs. Worthy's children. The elde&s;t, a daughter, named Dorcas, about fourteen, was gone to the weaver's with yarn of her own &s;pinning, for a piece of diaper. The &s;econd, a &s;on about twelve years old, was in the field with his father. He was named Henry Smith. The third, a &s;on in his elev|enth year, was weeding in the garden. The fourth, a daughter, almo&s;t nine, was a&s;&s;i&s;ting her mother. The fifth, a daughter, about &s;even, was &s;itting on a form, knitting. The &s;ixth, a &s;on about five, was &s;itting by his &s;i&s;|ter with a little book in his hand, and ap|peared much engaged in reading. Thus were they all employed, and each one &s;eemed &s;teady and intent upon their re&s;pective em|ployment. As I was &s;itting, and ob&s;erving the little brood acting under maternal direc|tion, I &s;aw the little boy whi&s;pering to his &s;i&s;ter, and had the curio&s;ity to li&s;ten to what he was telling her, and was delighted with the following dialogue between them. "Si&s;|ter, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, I am glad my name is Jo&s;eph." "Why are you glad of that Jo&s;e," &s;aid the little &s;i&s;ter? "Becau&s;e, &s;aid he, Jo&s;eph was a good man, and did a great deal of good. He was ju&s;t like my Daddy,
<PB N="103" REF="025609_0101_0FCE10BB16689280">
he gave away his corn to the poor folks who had'nt got any, and kept a great many poor little children from &s;tarving." This &s;peech almo&s;t brought tears in his little &s;i&s;ter's eyes, and &s;he replied with con&s;iderable emotion, "Well, I am glad my name is Mary too, for Mary was a very good woman, and &s;aid her prayers every night and every morning. She loved every body that was good, and never did any wicked things, and &s;he took good care of poor &s;ick folks, as Mamma al|ways does." I perceived by this conver&s;a|tion, that he was reading an abridgement of the hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph, and on inquiry I found the little girl had been reading &s;ome account of Mary. They were both impre&s;t with the characters of which they had been read|ing, and were de&s;irous of being like them. "Si&s;ter, &s;aid the little boy, if you are good now, you will be as good as &s;he was when you are grown up to be a woman; for Mamma &s;ays, the way to be good when we are grown up, is to be good when we are little&mdash;Think I &s;hall ever be as big as Jo&s;eph was?" "It is no matter, the little Mary replied, whether you ever be as big or not, if you are but as good as he; for I have heard Mamma &s;ay, that folks may be very good if they are not grown &s;o big as other folks. She &s;ays that Mary Do&s;&s;et, the poor

little old woman that comes here &s;ometimes&punc; is a good woman; and therefore that we mu&s;t not laugh at her becau&s;e &s;he is deform|ed, and is'nt as big as other folks."</P>
<P>I was delighted with this dialogue, which had been carried on in &s;o loud a whi&s;per as to attract our attention, and with &s;o much earne&s;tne&s;s that they did not perceive our noticing them until it was ended, when they returned to their re&s;pective employments: How happy mu&s;t the&s;e parents be? They &s;ee virtue blooming in the early &s;pring of life. They behold in their children that which will be the con&s;olation of declining years to their parents; and the perpetual &s;ource of &s;atisfaction to them&s;elves. They perceive their hearts forming to virtuous &s;en|timents, and hopeful characters.</P>
<P>Thus have I given you &s;ome faint de&s;crip|tion of farmer Worthy's dome&s;tic &s;tate. If you enjoy the de&s;cription as much as I did the &s;ight, your plea&s;ure is very great.

<P>As an evidence of his good opinion of Mrs. Worthy, he made her his almoner, by leav|ing a con&s;iderable &s;um of money in her hands, to be di&s;tributed among &s;ome poor families who had been driven in from the frontiers by the &s;avages, and were ju&s;t arrived in their neighborhood, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful circum|&s;tances Mrs. Worthy had repre&s;ented in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, in a very pathetic manner.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of Farmer Worthy, contra&s;ted with Mr. Slack&mdash;A gentleman falls from his hor&s;e&mdash;Of Mr. and Mrs. Belmont.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now time to take a more partic|ular view of farmer Worthy in the manage|ment of his family and affairs. He pur&s;ued his occupation with great indu&s;try; and ev|ery &s;pring he had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee his gra&s;s grow thicker by means of the manure and tillage he be&s;towed upon the ground; and it is an old &s;aying that "he is the be&s;t man in the kingdom who can make two &s;pears of gra&s;s grow where but one grew be|fore." He &s;aw his &s;tock encrea&s;ing, and every thing about him growing into better order and greater plenty. So that he could now guard again&s;t the evils of a drought by the remaining &s;tores of a former crop. His circum&s;tances were flouri&s;hing and pro&s;per|ous; but his pro&s;perity had not the effect which it too often produces. It makes &s;ome haughty and proud, others again it fills with covetous, avaricious de&s;ires, while it makes a third &s;ort fond of living too freely; they
<PB N="108" REF="025609_0106_0FCE10C3B5E7A308">
run into luxury and extravagance, and &s;o be|come negligent of their affairs. But it would be difficult to de&s;cribe with what gratitude farmer Worthy, and his wife, received the numerous ble&s;&s;ings which a bountiful Provi|dence &s;howered down upon them. They ever expre&s;&s;ed their thankfulne&s;s to the giver by an increa&s;ing zeal in his &s;ervice. They delighted more and more in keeping his &s;ab|baths, in &s;etting a good example, in wor|&s;hipping God with their hou&s;ehold, and in teaching them to know and fear the giver of all good things.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e was very different with Mr. Slack who had been a farmer of con&s;iderable pro&s;perous circum&s;tances while he continu|ed indu&s;trious and prudent. But when he had got into a good way for living, he began to grow vain and notional, and thought him|&s;elf above labor. So that he pre&s;ently be|became as negligent of his affairs out of the hou&s;e as his wife was within; and the peo|ple he hired &s;oon became as carele&s;s and negligent as him&s;elf. The con&s;equence of this was, that his affairs all went into con|fu&s;ion in a &s;hort time. His fences became bad, his cattle de&s;troyed his corn and mea|dows and did great damage to his neighbors' fields. He would patch up his fence &s;aying,
<PB N="109" REF="025609_0107_0FCE10C5D68DA2C8">
"That will do for the pre&s;ent." But this was only a trap and a &s;nare. By the&s;e means he lo&s;t his grain, and injured his neighbors', in&s;omuch that his crops made a poor appearance, while farmer Worthy's came in plentifully. This apparant differ|ence rai&s;ed the envy of Mr. Slack; and his wife's envy was excited by the notice that was taken of Mrs. Worthy who pa&s;&s;ed that way, while &s;he and her hu&s;band were de&s;pi&s;|ed by all ranks of people. They incurred the contempt and ridicule of the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible and fa&s;hionable people by their affect|tation of grandeur, and the hatred of many of the poorer but virtuous people by their inju&s;tice and want of kindne&s;s, for they were as carele&s;s about paying their debts as they were inattentive to their own affairs. They withheld the wages of the labourer, and ground the face of the poor. This was a very wicked thing in him, becau&s;e the labor|er is worthy of his hire; and he needs it who depends on his daily labor to furni&s;h his daily bread. Under the Jewi&s;h econo|my it was a divine ordinance that the wages of a laboring man &s;hould not be detained over night. "At this day thou &s;halt give his hire, neither &s;hall the &s;un go down up|on it, for he is poor."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxvi. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="025609_0108_0FCE10C6CEC60B20">
In farmer Worthy we &s;ee every thing dif|ferent. His affairs were all in the exacte&s;t order, and he lo&s;t nothing by carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. His hired men were well treated and punctually paid, his fields and meadows were put into the be&s;t order, his fences were &s;ea&s;onably repaired, &s;o that neither his own nor his neighbors' grain &s;uffered by his cat|tle. They were well fed and tenderly u&s;ed, for he was a very humane as well as hone&s;t man, and delighted in &s;eeing every creature about him happy. He u&s;ed often to &s;ay that "he thought it was very nece&s;&s;ary to have laws for the protection of the dumb bea&s;ts from the tyranny of cruel men, for that they were not given to us that we might vent our pa&s;&s;ions upon them in abu&s;es and ill u&s;age." Tho&s;e who lived in his hou&s;e, and labored in his fields, never failed to go away plea&s;ed with the treatment they receiv|ed both from him and Mrs. Worthy. They were always plea&s;ed with the order that run through the family, and particularly &s;o with his management among them.</P>
<P>An incident that gave Mr. Worthy an opportunity of di&s;covering the goodne&s;s of his heart, and opening the way to a more thorough knowledge of his dome&s;tic charac|ter, de&s;erves notice in this place. A gentle|man

by the name of Belmont met with a mo&s;t terrible fall from his hor&s;e as he was journeying near Mr. Worthy's. The af|frighted hor&s;e drew the rider &s;ome di&s;tance by the &s;tirrup, till that giving way left him in the road. Mr. Worthy, who had been witne&s;s to the di&s;a&s;ter, run with all &s;peed to his relief. He was much injured by the fall, and at fir&s;t &s;eemed breathle&s;s, but on being carried into the hou&s;e and laid on a bed, he began to di&s;cover &s;igns of life, and by the aid of &s;ome cool water, and chafing in the hands, he &s;o far recovered by the time the phy&s;ician came, as to inform who he was and from whence he came.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that Mr. Belmont, who had always lived in the town, conceived a very unfavourable opinion of the country people; he thought them ill natured and in|capable of humanity; and had therefore en|deavoured to di&s;&s;uade Mr. Blanford from any thoughts of a country life. An unfor|tunate event had now thrown him into the hands of a man who&s;e highe&s;t ambition it was to merit the &s;tyle of <HI>farmer,</HI> and where he was likely to be detained &s;ome time to experience the ho&s;pitality of a farmer's hou&s;e. As this was the ca&s;e, he propo&s;ed to Mr. and Mrs. Worthy, &s;ending for his wife, if agree|able
<PB N="112" REF="025609_0110_0FCE10CC49DC6A00">
to them. To his propo&s;al they cheer|fully con&s;ented, &s;aying, "that they were but plain farmers, and if Mrs. Belmont could put up with their way of living they &s;hould be glad to &s;ee her." She was accordingly &s;ent for, and in due time &s;he arrived. It was an unfortunate circum&s;tance that Mrs. Belmont was wholly unacquainted with a country life. Being &s;omewhat of a haughty woman too, and but little di&s;po&s;ed to con|form to the manners of others, &s;he di&s;cover|ed &s;igns of di&s;like on her arrival and looked awry at every thing &s;he &s;aw.&mdash;"Such &s;tuff," &s;he would &s;ay of the &s;alt beef and pork, &amp;c. that was brought upon table for dinner, "may do well enough for people in the country who work for their living, but it is enough to kill tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to delicate living."</P>
<P>Mr. Belmont bore the pain of his wounds, and the operation of dre&s;&s;ing them, with great patience; but the follies of his wife were in&s;upportable. She had enough of that kind of breeding which taught her to move gracefully in a polite circle, but had not &s;en&s;e enough to know that true polite|ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in behaving well to every body. Mr. Belmont began by this time to loo&s;e his former prejudices again&s;t country

people and farmers. He experienced &s;o much ho&s;pitality from Mr. and Mrs. Wor|thy that he endeavoured to &s;olve their feel|ings by gentle words and grateful acknow|ledgments. Being a well bred man, he knew how to make allowances for the dif|ference in the manners of people and of their living. Things continued in this way for &s;ome time, till at length Mr. Belmont had &s;o far recovered of his wounds as to think of endeavouring to return home. He therefore de&s;ired Mr. Worthy to let him know what compen&s;ation he &s;hould make them for the trouble he had occa&s;ioned, and the many civilities he had received dur|ing his confinement.&mdash;"I have no demand upon you, Sir, &s;aid Mr. Worthy; I con&s;ider it my duty to regard with care the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others. By &s;erving you Sir, I have had no view to my own benefit. It is not in your power to add any thing to the plea&s;ure I feel from having had it in my power to afford you relief." Mr. Belmont was amaz|ed at the noblene&s;s of his &s;pirit and the dig|nity of his attitude on this occa&s;ion; but could not prevail on him to accept any thing as a compen&s;ation. And as to Mrs. Bel|mont, &s;he was quite overcome by this act of genero&s;ity. Her own follies recurred upon
<PB N="114" REF="025609_0112_0FCE10CF1C22E950">
her mind with redoubled force, and quite put her to the blu&s;h. Every thing being prepared for their journey, they took an af|fectionate leave, with ideas of the farmers very different from tho&s;e they entertained before this event took place. Mrs. Belmont could not help being affected, touched and impre&s;&s;ed, by the unaffected ho&s;pitality with which they had been treated, and &s;ent Mrs. Worthy &s;ome hand&s;ome pre&s;ents. The dif|ferent &s;entiments both of them entertained of the farmers in general, and the high opin|ion they formed of Mr. Worthy and family, are expre&s;&s;ed by Mr. Belmont, in a letter to Mr. Blanford, &s;oon after his recovery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Containing Mr. Belmont's letter to Mr. Blan|ford in prai&s;e of a country life.&mdash;Anecdote of Sir Philip Sidney.</HEAD>
<P>DURING Mr. Belmont's confine|ment he had opportunity for many reflec|tions, and being out of the noi&s;e of the town, they took a turn different from what they probably would have done if he had been &s;urrounded by his friends in the gay &s;cenes of life. In this calm retreat he would con|template things in a more cool and rational light. To a mind thus at liberty to judge of things as they really are, there are many things in the fa&s;hionable circles of great towns which will appear fooli&s;h and vain. The rea&s;on of their not appearing &s;o to tho&s;e who are in the giddy round is, that they do not &s;top long enough at any one point to view them in a cool and deliberate manner. Mr. Belmont &s;eems to have been brought to a &s;tand long enough for this purpo&s;e, and to have turned his mind to this &s;ubject with &s;ome attention, and his ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject appear to be pertinent and good.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="025609_0114_0FCE10D4D5F59CD0">
In our towns, &s;aid he, where parade and &s;how are every thing, fa&s;hionable dre&s;s is con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t important things in life. There are few who &s;eem to pay any regard to the di&s;tinction of charac|ters as they re&s;pect virtue and under&s;tand|ing. In this &s;entiment our young men are confirmed by mo&s;t of the young ladies with whom they conver&s;e. But whatever may be the ideas of the fa&s;hionable part of the world about the&s;e things, and about the u&s;e|ful virtues of life, &s;uch as indu&s;try, &s;obriety and economy, I am convinced that the hu|man &s;pecies can only be &s;upplied with food and nece&s;&s;aries by a con&s;tant a&s;&s;iduity in cultivating the earth, and providing for their mutual wants. By labor every thing is pro|duced; without labor the mo&s;t fertile fields would &s;oon be overrun with fore&s;ts, the fine&s;t meadows become &s;tagnant waters, or wild and unyielding thickets, the flocks would run wild and be u&s;ele&s;s. I therefore con|clude that labor is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty of man, from which no one can have a right entirely to withdraw him|&s;elf. If therefore there is any difference be|tween one human being and another, that part of them mu&s;t be the mo&s;t valuable who cultivate the ground, and provide nece&s;&s;aries

The late experience I have had of this, at Mr. Worthy's, has taught me a new le&s;|&s;on, and given me a &s;pecimen of native good|ne&s;s and undi&s;tingui&s;hed philanthropy. As I was on my return from viewing my e&s;tate in the we&s;t, my hor&s;e took a &s;udden fright, and went from under me &s;o quick that I could not recover the &s;addle. My left foot &s;lip|ped into the &s;turrips, and I was dragged a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The fir&s;t thing that I can recollect after this dreadful fall, is that I was &s;urrounded by a family who&s;e com|pa&s;&s;ionate looks made a very deep impre&s;&s;ion on my mind. The children were bathed in tears, at the &s;ight of a man torn and bloody as I was. One of the children, indeed, lay very &s;ick at the time; but they &s;eemed to forget their own di&s;tre&s;&s;es for the pre&s;ent, and to be wholly ab&s;orbed by mine, which appeared &s;o much greater. The noble &s;pi|rited exertions of Mr. Worthy on this occa|&s;ion, convinced me that true elevation of mind might be found among farmers; and reminded me of the conduct of Sir Philip Sidney, in the battle near Zutphen, in the Low Countries. He was one of the brighte&s;t ornaments of Queen Elizabeth's court, and was a per&s;on of equal bravery and polite|ne&s;s. In the above mentioned action, he

di&s;covered <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> courage. Having lo&s;t two hor&s;es under him, as he was mounting the third, an unlucky &s;hot from the enemy's trenches broke his thigh. He returned to the camp, which was &s;ome di&s;tance off, on hor&s;eback. Being faint and parched with thir&s;t through fatigue and the lo&s;s of blood, he called for &s;ome water, which was pre&s;ently brought him; but ju&s;t as he was rai&s;ing the ve&s;&s;el to his mouth to drink, a poor wounded &s;oldier, who happened at that in&s;tant to be carried by, looked up to it wi&s;hfully; the gallant generous Sidney took the cup from his mouth before he had ta&s;ted the water, and gave it to the &s;uffering &s;ol|dier, &s;aying, "Thy nece&s;&s;ities are greater than mine."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Sir Philip was conveyed to Anhelm, and attended by the principal &s;urgeons of the camp. During &s;ixteen days, great hopes were entertained of his recovery; but the ball not being extracted, and a mortification en&s;uing, he pre|pared him&s;elf for death with the utmo&s;t piety and fortitude, and expired on the &s;eventeenth of October, 1586, in the thirty &s;econd year of his age.

But above all, govern your will and affections by the will and word of your Creator; in me beholding the end of this world, with all her vanities."</NOTE></P>
<P>This was an example, not only of the greate&s;t virtue and humanity, but al&s;o of
<PB N="120" REF="025609_0118_0FCE10E01D0638B8">
that elevated method of thinking which con|&s;tituted the true gentleman, whether he be a farmer or a profe&s;&s;ional man. For what is it that gives a &s;uperiority of manners, but the inclination to &s;acrifice our own plea&s;ures and intere&s;ts to the well being of others? An ordinary per&s;on might have pitied the poor &s;oldier, or would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, when he had fir&s;t taken care of him&s;elf; but who, in &s;uch a dreadful extremity as the brave Sidney was reduced to, would be ca|pable of even forgetting his own &s;ufferings to relive another, unle&s;s he had acquired the generous habit of always &s;lighting his own gratification for the &s;ake of his fellow crea|tures?</P>
<P>In Farmer Worthy I found all the marks of this &s;ame elevation of mind, which I think probable would have carried him to as great lengths of humanity and genero&s;ity in &s;imi|lar circum&s;tances. The goodne&s;s of his heart was expre&s;&s;ed by an uninterrupted &s;cene of kind actions, performed in &s;o obliging a manner as &s;eemed to double their value. But I do not intend to give you a detail of actions which related to my&s;elf only. The regularity of his proceeding in his family merits particular notice, and is worthy of the imitation of every one.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="025609_0119_0FCE10E1647C8F98">
No man could be more attentive to bu&s;ine&s;s than Mr. Worthy, yet this never inter|fered with the care of his children, nor the exemplary devotion of his hou&s;e. In all his proceedings he ob&s;erved method. This enabled him to have every thing move in its place and to pre&s;erve peace in his family. In order to this he found it nece&s;&s;ary to ri&s;e early in the morning. In the winter &s;ea&s;on the family were all up &s;o as to unite in family devotions as &s;oon as he could &s;ee to read in a large bible by day light. There was a dignity in his manner of attending this &s;ervice, far above what would have been ex|pected from a man of his education and man|ner of life, and a fervency in its performance which &s;hewed that it was not a matter of habit, but of choice and plea&s;ure. To this very proper and u&s;eful exerci&s;e &s;ucceeded breakfa&s;t, and to that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, to which every one went as they were directed. No difficulty or oppo&s;ition ever aro&s;e among any of them about the &s;ervices a&s;&s;igned them that I ever &s;aw or heard. In the evening Mr. Worthy generally em|ployed &s;ome time in reading, of which I perceived he was very fond. Some|times he would employ one of the children in reading for the common benefit. His
<PB N="122" REF="025609_0120_0FCE10E297A10AB0">
books I ob&s;erved were all of a moral nature and tendency. The &s;tories and characters they read would affect their minds and leave good impre&s;&s;ions upon them. As Mr. Worthy began the day with God, &s;o he clo&s;|ed it by acknowledging him before his fami|ly. This practice, be&s;ides its being a &s;uita|ble expre&s;&s;ion of piety to God, had a good effect on the minds of his family, both by leading them to be pious, and by promoting affection and harmony among them. It tended al&s;o to in&s;pire benevolence for others, and e&s;pecially for the afflicted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, for whom he always prayed mo&s;t fervently. It had a good effect al&s;o in keeping the fam|ily more together than they otherwi&s;e could have been, for the young people of the family were never out beyond that hour ex|cept on &s;pecial occa&s;ions. The &s;ame &s;teady cour&s;e carried him through the year, and all things pro&s;pered well with him. The &s;ab|bath was al&s;o ob&s;erved with great order and propriety. It was &s;trictly a day of re&s;t from all unnece&s;&s;ary labor. Every thing was &s;o adju&s;ted at the clo&s;e of the week as that the &s;abbath might be ob&s;erved in &s;uch a manner as be&s;t to an&s;wer its de&s;ign. Indeed, my dear Sir, I left this ho&s;pitable hou&s;e with ideas of a farmer's hou&s;e, and the advantages of

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Containing a further account of Mr. Slack&mdash;the fatal con&s;equences of intemperance&mdash;his death&mdash;Mr. Worthy's conduct with re&s;pect to him.</HEAD>
<P>IT was by means of this e&s;tabli&s;hed or|der, &s;teady indu&s;try and frugality, that Mr. Worthy was able now to encrea&s;e his prop|erty from the produce of his farm; his chil|dren grew up as olive plants round about him, and in all things he pro&s;pered well. In the mean time Mr. Slack became un&s;ucce&s;s|ful in almo&s;t every thing. His produce was much of it lo&s;t for want of being attended to in &s;ea&s;on. In winter his cattle and &s;heep died for want of care. His intere&s;t wa&s;ted away by degrees, till he got into debt, and this involved him in many difficulties. From the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments he might have extricated him&s;elf by indu&s;try and frugality; but in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the&s;e mea&s;ures to get out of his troubles, he began to drink hard. He would &s;eldom pa&s;s a tavern without &s;topping to drink; and to &s;pend
<PB N="125" REF="025609_0123_0FCE10E9B9FF7150">
his time and money, with idle and fooli&s;h people who followed a &s;imilar practice. Sometimes he would come home quite in di&s;gui&s;e with liquor, and frequently at a late hour too, which made great confu&s;ion in the hou&s;e. His wife would find fault with him, and very ju&s;tly too, for neglecting his bu&s;ine&s;s and wa&s;ting his &s;ub&s;tance; and for di&s;gui&s;ing him&s;elf &s;o too. He in turn would rail at her for de&s;&s;ing &s;o fine. So that they rendered each other very unhap|py. The con&s;equence was, that their chil|dren grew up like the wild a&s;&s;es' colt, and all their hou&s;ehold were at loo&s;e ends. The &s;abbath was regarded only as a day of idlene&s;s, and often produced &s;cenes of in|temperance. Their children and hired peo|ple got into a habit of gaming and drinking; from tho&s;e they &s;oon proceeded to quar|relling and fighting. They would ride the hor&s;es mo&s;t cruelly to taverns and frolicks, and when they came home late at night, would turn them out to &s;hiver in the cold without any proper care. Mr. Slack kept one hor&s;e for his own u&s;e, in better order than the re&s;t. But when he is in his cups he would whip and &s;pur him to &s;how his &s;pirits, and would ride him on &s;uch occa&s;ions very hard. It happened, as he was put|ting
<PB N="126" REF="025609_0124_0FCE10EAD3AB3F70">
his hor&s;e in &s;pirits when going to a tav|ern where he expected to meet &s;everal tav|ern haunters, his hor&s;e &s;tumbled over a roll|ing &s;tone, as he was in full gallop, whereby the rider was brought to the ground. Un|fortunately for Mr. Slack, the hor&s;e rolled over him and broke his thigh very badly. The hor&s;e &s;prang up and ran home with all &s;peed; but Mr. Slack lay in a mo&s;t terrible &s;ituation for &s;ome time. At length Mr. Worthy, who was on his way home from Mr. Jones', who was very &s;ick, and to who&s;e nece&s;&s;ities he had been admini&s;tering, came to the place where Mr. Slack lay groaning in a mo&s;t bitter manner. Mr. Worthy was much &s;urprized to find him in this &s;ituation, and like the good Samaritan came to his re|lief. But as he could not do any thing a|lone he rode with great ha&s;te to the neare&s;t hou&s;e for help to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying him home. He groaned out many ill &s;peeches again&s;t the hor&s;e, without recollecting the unprovoked blows and &s;purs he had given the poor creature. Mr. Worthy endeavor|ed to &s;oothe him, and to convey him along in the ea&s;ie&s;t manner he po&s;&s;ibly could. Mr. Slack was much &s;urprized at his ten|derne&s;s towards him, for he was con&s;cious of having done Mr. Worthy many injuries.
<PB N="127" REF="025609_0125_0FCE10EE49D9B2B0">
But Mr. Worthy never &s;uffered anger to lodge in his brea&s;t. If he was at any time reviled, he did not revile in return, but would do good to tho&s;e who did evil to him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Slack was very much afflicted at &s;eeing her hu&s;band brought home in &s;uch a plight. But Mr. Worthy comforted her by telling her that though it appeared to be a bad wound, yet that he hoped that it was not dangerous. He tried to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ur|geon in &s;etting the bone; and during the time of his confinement both Mr. Worthy and his wife &s;howed great kindne&s;s by fre|quently vi&s;iting, and by a&s;&s;i&s;ting in every way they could. They did not &s;tand aloof as Mr. Emmons did, and forbid any of his family going near them becau&s;e he was of|fended at Mr. Slack. He &s;eemed rather to rejoice at what had taken place than feel any &s;ympathy for him. Mrs. Slack now &s;aw the error of her conduct toward Mr. and Mrs. Worthy, and was a&s;hamed of it. She &s;aw that their humanity and tender|ne&s;s were not pretended but real virtues, and that they were not to be defeated by any injuries they had received.</P>
<P>Mr. Slack continued to grow wor&s;e till the &s;urgeon found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="128" REF="025609_0126_0FCE10EF4CD09420">
cut off the limb in order to prevent a mor|tification. Tho this terrible operation was performed &s;killfully, yet a fever, occa&s;ioned by the bad &s;tate his blood was in through intemperance, &s;eized him, and threatened his life. Mr. Worthy vi&s;ited him every day, and finding his fever rage to a high degree, he propo&s;ed to Mr. Slack to &s;end for Mr.&mdash;, the clergyman, to conver&s;e and pray with him. But what can the pre&s;ence of a mini&s;ter avail toward the &s;alvation of a poor creature who has &s;pent his days in vice and intemperance? Mr.&mdash;, however, came to vi&s;it Mr. Slack, but found him in &s;o broken a &s;tate of mind as to be incapable of much conver&s;ation. He would attempt to &s;ay &s;omething, but his di&s;tre&s;s and agony was &s;o great that he was interrupted and broken. He would frequently cry out&mdash;"O that I had &s;erved my Maker as faithfuly as I have my own lu&s;t and appetites! that I had kept his &s;abbath as good people do! how much better &s;hould I have been at this time?" His con&s;cience was awake to reflection, and filled him with mo&s;t dreadful horror. Every thing he &s;aw reminded him either of omi&s;|&s;ions of duty or commi&s;&s;ions of &s;in&mdash;"Your kindne&s;s, &s;aid he to Mr. Worthy, is almo&s;t too much for me. It reminds me of my
<PB N="129" REF="025609_0127_0FCE10F0DEA48F08">
unkindne&s;s to you, of the hard things I have &s;aid, and the ill things I have done to you. I now &s;ee my folly, and am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed more than I can expre&s;s about all my &s;ins." Mr. Worthy a&s;&s;ured him that he need not give him&s;elf any trouble or unea&s;ine&s;s on his ac|count, for that he had not laid up any thing again&s;t him, but wi&s;hed it was in his power to render him more &s;ervice. Mr. Worthy happened to be pre&s;ent when the agonies of death came on, and continued with him in that dreadful condition until death clo&s;ed the horrid &s;cene. He was greatly affected by the unhappy end of a man who had lived in &s;o loo&s;e and irregular a manner. When he con&s;idered the account which all rational creatures mu&s;t give of the improvement of their time, and talents, he could &s;carcely help trembling for tho&s;e who wa&s;te their time, precious time, and abu&s;e their rational powers, at taverns, and in the company of loo&s;e and profane people. Mrs. Slack doubt|le&s;s thought of the&s;e practices, and recol|lected by what means her hu&s;band was brought to his end. She therefore gave way to the violence of her pa&s;&s;ions, and was al|mo&s;t be&s;ide her&s;elf with grief. Mr. Worthy endeavored to comfort her and to reconcile her to what had taken place, as it was the
<PB N="130" REF="025609_0128_0FCE10F262EEFE40">
will of God. She &s;eemed at length to be more compo&s;ed; but her tranquillity was not of long continuance. Trouble of ano|ther kind came upon her. The e&s;tate was &s;eized by the creditors, and &s;he was left in a poor and de&s;titute condition. This is what every one may expect will be the ca&s;e with their families, who follow gaming and drink|ing, to the neglect of their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Farmer Worthy has a rational &s;cheme for the education of his children&mdash;Maxims of edu|cation.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few who con&s;ider con&s;e|quences, or trace effects up to their cau&s;es, &s;o as to gain &s;uitable in&s;truction and influ|ence from them. Mr. Slack could &s;ee the con&s;equences of conduct like his in other people, but did not con&s;ider them in his own ca&s;e. If he had looked forward, and con|&s;idered what mu&s;t be the effects of his loo&s;e, vague manner of living, he would have &s;hud|dered at the thought of being the occa&s;ion of ruin and di&s;tre&s;s to his family. He was not de&s;titute of regard to his wife, nor of af|fection for his children; and yet he pur&s;ued practices directly tending to their ruin, and which, in their con&s;equences, not only reduc|ed them to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, but di&s;qual|ified his children for life. In order to pre|pare children to live in the world, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to train them up in the knowledge of bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the habits of indu&s;try;
<PB N="132" REF="025609_0130_0FCE10F54B301320">
but if examples of a contrary nature are &s;et before them, all in&s;truction is vain and u&s;e|le&s;s. Childhood and youth may be con&s;id|ered as a term of apprentice&s;hip in which they are to be exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e employ|ments whereby they are to live. They are not only to be made acquainted with bu&s;i|ne&s;s as a practical &s;cience, but to be taught &s;elf government, and to be trained to the ex|erci&s;e of all tho&s;e amiable qualities whereby they will become good and agreeable, u&s;eful and happy.</P>
<P>Farmer Worthy appeared to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things upon his mind, and en|deavored to practice accordingly. His views were not confined merely to the tillage of the land, but he devoted his mind to more rational objects, the care of his family, and his own immortal intere&s;t. Indeed, he at|tended to the cultivation of the earth as a profe&s;&s;ional calling, which he deemed an honorable occupation, becau&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to man; and as it was the employment of Adam in innocence. He felt his dependence upon the Providence of God for every thing he enjoyed, and never failed to &s;eek his ble&s;&s;ing upon all his endeavors. But the education of his children was a matter that lay with great wait upon his mind. When he look|ed
<PB N="133" REF="025609_0131_0FCE10F7F2ED71F0">
around and &s;aw how little attention many farmers paid to the minds of their children, he was &s;hocked at the idea of having his chil|dren grow up with minds &s;o uncultivated. He would compare them to the fore&s;t that remains in its rude &s;tate without cultivation. He thought it the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of every parent to cultivate the minds of his children in knowledge and in the principles of virtue. This duty he endeavored to prac|ti&s;e in an uniform manner. In order to do it mo&s;t effectually, he &s;tudied very attentively the different tempers and di&s;po&s;itions of his children, and endeavored to govern them accordingly. This difference of di&s;po&s;ition appears at an early period, and any extremes ought to be corrected whenever an opportu|nity occurs. In a dome&s;tic &s;tate, opportuni|ties are frequently occurring. It is but to watch tho&s;e with care, and the work is done. Mr. Worthy &s;eems to have had a rational &s;cheme of managing his children, which he had dige&s;ted well in his own mind; and which may be reduced to the following max|ims, or leading principles of education.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions on the &s;en&s;es produce la&s;ting effects on the mind. They &s;hould therefore be &s;uch as will be favorable to virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="025609_0132_0FCE10F9769334E8">
Children, when very young, are taught by &s;igns. The&s;e &s;hould be &s;uch as to convey the be&s;t impre&s;&s;ions&mdash;Look grieved, not angry, at their bad actions&mdash;joyful at their good ones, and compa&s;&s;ionate at their trou|bles or pains.</P>
<P>To imitate others is a natural propen&s;ity in childhood&mdash;teach them to avoid danger, by avoiding it your&s;elves&mdash;remove fear where there is no danger, by coolne&s;s and cheer|fulne&s;s&mdash;accu&s;tom them from infancy to go in the dark, and they will never be affraid of it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e are their wor&s;t enemies, who talk to children of gho&s;ts, and apparitions, &amp;c.&mdash;Suf|fer no &s;uch per&s;on to tarry in your hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Stubbornne&s;s is an attempt to u&s;urp their authority. Let it be &s;ubdued by a &s;teady tone of voice and manner of treatment. If the child will not eat what is offered, let it have nothing, hunger will bring it to. If it refu&s;es to do as bidden, deprive it of a favor|ite thing.</P>
<P>To hear frequent complaints from chil|dren, tends to beget jealou&s;ies and ill will among them.&mdash;If then you would pre&s;erve harmony between them, &s;uffer them not to complain one of another.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="025609_0133_0FCE10FB20078A08">
Indulge not your children to exce&s;s&mdash;this would be giving them the authority over you, that you &s;hould pre&s;erve over them.</P>
<P>Cruelty to in&s;ects and animals generates cruelty to men&mdash;correct this di&s;po&s;ition with care&mdash;&s;ay with concern, "poor thing, it is capable of feeling pain as well as you, how would you like to be tortured &s;o?"</P>
<P>In the life they are ju&s;t beginning they will be expo&s;ed to many accidental evils&mdash;early enure them to bear the&s;e with firmne&s;s. "A young Spartan who had been trained to this, &s;uffered a fox which he had &s;tolen, to eat into his bowels rather than di&s;clo&s;e the theft."</P>
<P>Indu&s;try and virtue are as nearly allied as indu&s;try and riches. Let the plays of children be connected with indu&s;try&mdash;give &s;ons a &s;pot to till for their own amu&s;ement and profit&mdash;to daughters, a little bed in the garden, or a lamb to bring up for them&s;elves; and by various other ways unite indu&s;try and economy with amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Indu&s;try pre&s;erves good humor.&mdash;Let childhood be occupied with &s;ome employ|ment&mdash;nothing has a better effect on the di&s;po&s;ition, or better fits them for u&s;efulne&s;s and enjoyment in life.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="025609_0134_0FCE10FC30795CE0">
Idlene&s;s begets ill nature and peevi&s;hne&s;s. It is the parent of many vices&mdash;cure chil|dren of this di&s;po&s;ition by active diver&s;ions, and by making indu&s;try nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. "He that will not work, let him not eat."</P>
<P>Benevolence is the ba&s;is of many good and amiable qualities&mdash;Let this be cheri&s;hed by example, and by every method of encourag|ing charity in children. The practice of do|ing good cannot fail of improving a bene|volent di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>To be kind and beneficent, is to imitate the greate&s;t of all beings.&mdash;Convince your children that they cannot be more honorably employed than in relieving the indigent, not only with money, but by many kind offices.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of our pre&s;ent &s;tate de|pends much on the treatment we receive from others, and as we give we may expect to receive&mdash;fail not then to teach your chil|dren civility to all, poor as well as rich.</P>
<P>"Knowledge, &s;aid a great man, is as grateful to the under&s;tanding, as light to the eyes."&mdash;Di&s;courage not the curio&s;ity of your children, but encourage their inquiries after knowledge.</P>
<P>The appetites and de&s;ires of children gather &s;trength by indulgence. They will
<PB N="137" REF="025609_0135_0FCE10FF1751E4F8">
&s;oon become tyrants if too often gratified; but will make u&s;eful &s;ubjects under due reg|ulation&mdash;re&s;train them by authority when quite young, and as rea&s;on dawns explain to them the folly of unre&s;trained indulgence.</P>
<P>Habits of integrity will make children tru&s;t worthy.&mdash;Would you have your chil|dren faithful to a tru&s;t, early commit things to them in confidence, and require a faithful account.</P>
<P>A frank di&s;po&s;ition is as beautiful in char|acter as it is u&s;eful in &s;ociety&mdash;gain the con|fidence of children by gentle treatment, and they will not think of di&s;&s;embling.</P>
<P>Children feel unhappy when they have committed a fault, until they confe&s;s it. Let a confe&s;&s;ion procure pardon, they will con|fe&s;s to relieve their minds; this will le&s;&s;en the number of their faults, and increa&s;e their confidence in their parents.</P>
<P>Children are apt to think that happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in a fine hou&s;e or in riches.&mdash;To cure this error point out in&s;tances to the contrary, and &s;how them that the heart is the &s;eat of happine&s;s, and that no one can be unhappy who is contented with his lot.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Anecdote of little Jo&s;eph&mdash;Story of Robert and Hugh Hamilton&mdash;the good character and pro&s;perity of the former, and the badne&s;s and misfortunes of the other.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER &s;o much dry matter, I think a &s;tory founded on fact, which Mr. Worthy promi&s;ed little Jo&s;eph upon a certain occa|&s;ion, will be acceptable to the young reader. If properly regarded, it will be &s;erviceable to him al&s;o. The occa&s;ion of this promi&s;e was this. Mr. Worthy's little &s;on Jo&s;eph, as he was at play with &s;ome little boys, heard one of them, who was a new comer into the place, &s;peak bad words; and when his brother told him that he would tell his ma&s;ter if he did not leave off &s;peaking &s;uch wicked words, this bad boy replied, that "he did not care for his ma&s;ter. He would play truant when he had a mind to." This &s;peech &s;o &s;hocked the mind of little Jo&s;eph, that he ran directly home and told his mo|ther that he would not play with Billy Hil|ler any more, becau&s;e he &s;poke bad words,
<PB N="144" REF="025609_0142_0FCE110E80740720">
and was a very wicked boy. Mrs. Worthy was &s;o plea&s;ed with this piece of conduct in her little &s;on that &s;he related every circum|&s;tance of it to Mr. Worthy as &s;oon as he came home. He called Jo&s;eph a good boy for doing as he had done, and as a re|ward for his good conduct told him, that he would relate to him a &s;tory of two boys, which would &s;how him the happy effects of behaving well, and the fatal con&s;cequences of being wicked when young. But as the &s;tory was &s;omething lengthy and it was now time for Jo&s;eph to go to bed, Mr. Worthy told him that he would re&s;erve it till the next evening. This delay was a great trial to Jo|&s;eph's patience, for his curio&s;ity was greatly rai&s;ed. But being accu&s;tomed to obedience, he went directly to bed without any marks of impatience. The next evening Mr. Wor|thy, who was always careful to fulfil his pro|mi&s;es to his children, took care to be at home in &s;uch &s;ea&s;on as to di&s;charge his engagement to Jo&s;eph before his bed time. No &s;ooner was Mr. Worthy &s;eated in the hou&s;e than Jo&s;eph reminded his daddy of his promi&s;e, and he immediately related as follows.</P>
<P>In the town where Mr. Belmont lives, there lived, not many years ago, a gentleman by the name of Hamilton. This gentleman came
<PB N="145" REF="025609_0143_0FCE110FA2DABEA8">
over from Scotland and got a great e&s;tate by trading in that town. He had &s;everal child|ren, but lo&s;t them all except two &s;ons. Their names were Robert and Hugh. Their parents were &s;o affraid that &s;omething would happen to deprive them of the&s;e, that they had &s;carcely any comfort, and watched over them with great care. They were &s;o fond of them al&s;o, that they indulged them in every thing that they wi&s;hed for. They never could &s;ee any fine thing but they wanted it; and then it mu&s;t be bought for them. "O daddy, cried Jo&s;eph, I wi&s;h I could have all I want, I would &s;oon have &s;uch a fine gold laced hat as Mrs. Bel|mont &s;aid her little George has got, and &s;uch a little &s;word too as &s;he &s;aid he had." "Stay Jo&s;e, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, hear how they came out before you wi&s;h for &s;uch fooli&s;h things." Robert, tho naturally a good tempered boy, was much injured by being &s;o much indulg|ed. He would frequently be out of humor, but was very fond of his book, and had a great de&s;ire to learn. It was by means of this that his parents were able to keep him &s;teady at &s;chool. But Hugh, who was nat|urally cro&s;s, was very trouble&s;ome and un|mannerly. He hated his books and did not care whether he learnt to read or not. He
<PB N="146" REF="025609_0144_0FCE11110B48B3D0">
often played truant. His parents did not correct him for it; nor would they &s;uffer his ma&s;ter to do it. He grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, till he would &s;peak all manner of bad words, and fight with the boys, and made every body hate or de&s;pi&s;e him. At la&s;t his ma&s;ter became quite tired of being troubled with &s;uch an illnatured ba&s;e boy, and de&s;ired his father to &s;end him &s;omewhere el&s;e, for he could do nothing with him. This was a dreadful trouble to his parents. But they were obliged to &s;end him to a &s;chool in the country, where they hoped he would do better. They began now to &s;ee their error in indulging him too much, and endeavored to be more &s;trict with him. He behaved bet|ter for a little while, but they indulged him in coming home too often. In &s;hort, he was &s;o bad a boy that no body loved him where he now was. He was &s;o fretful and ill natured that he made more enemies than friends. When Mr. Hamilton found he did not learn, he blamed the ma&s;ter, and threatened to remove his &s;on to another place. This was very good news to the ma&s;ter, and to all the &s;cholars, for he was very trouble&s;ome to both, and would not attend to his book; and always cho&s;e to play with the wor&s;t boys that he could find,
<PB N="147" REF="025609_0145_0FCE111351D3DF90">
becau&s;e their wickedne&s;s afforded him &s;ome countenance.</P>
<P>In the mean time Robert was very &s;tudi|ous, and learnt &s;o well that he got before mo&s;t of the boys of his own age. He be|haved &s;o mannerly and plea&s;ant to every body, that every one who knew him loved him, and &s;poke well of him. This was a great comfort to his parents; but the conduct of Hugh gave them great pain. When they had arrived at &s;uch an age as to be put to bu&s;ine&s;s, Robert was put to a mer|chant in the &s;ame town, where he continued to recommend him&s;elf by his good conduct. But what to do with Hugh they knew not. At la&s;t they received a letter from an uncle of his in Scotland, who was of the &s;ame name. This gentleman informed Mr. Hamilton that he had ju&s;t buried his only &s;on; and under&s;tanding that he had one of the &s;ame name, he had written for him to come over and live with him. This appeared to be a fine opening both to new motives to behave well, and to be made an heir to a great e&s;|tate. Hugh was accordingly &s;ent to his un|cle; but he was &s;oon &s;urpri&s;ed and morti|fied to find what a dunce he was. He was &s;till more vexed when he di&s;covered him to be an ill natured, mi&s;chievous and wicked
<PB N="148" REF="025609_0146_0FCE1114CA56D5D8">
boy. Indeed, it was &s;ome time before his uncle di&s;covered how ba&s;e and vicious a lad he was, for he continued a good while to deceive him; but at la&s;t threw off all re|&s;traint. He kept the wor&s;t company he could find, was frequently out all night, drinking and gaming, and at all the vile&s;t hou&s;es that there was. Thus did Hugh conduct tho' his uncle offered to do every thing for him if he would behave well, that he would not only make him a man a bu|&s;ine&s;s but give him a great part of his e&s;|tate. But he had grown &s;o hardened and abandoned that he cared not for any thing that could be &s;aid. Mr. Hamilton, hearing of the ill conduct of his &s;on, wrote to him repeatedly to endeavor to reclaim him, and make him behave well.&mdash;"I am &s;ure, &s;aid Charles, he mu&s;t be a very wicked boy in|deed, daddy, if neither his uncle, money, nor his father's commands, could make him bet|ter." Yes, my &s;on, continued Mr. Wor|thy, but it is no more &s;trange than true, noth|ing could reclaim him, he had become &s;o bad, and was &s;o much under the influence of his ba&s;e companions. This conduct of a &s;on, &s;o tenderly beloved, broke his mother's heart; and his father was &s;o affected by her death and his conduct, both together, that
<PB N="149" REF="025609_0147_0FCE111927492CB8">
his health began to decline, and before Hugh was twenty one years old his father died, leaving the mo&s;t of his e&s;tate to Robert. This train of events &s;eemed to have a good effect on Hugh for a little while, which gave his uncle &s;o much hope of his ref|ormation that he gave him five hundred pounds to do bu&s;ine&s;s with; but his bad companions &s;oon made him &s;pend it all. He came over to America not long after this, for his uncle would have no more to do with him.</P>
<P>Robert had all this time been improving his mind, and had began to encrea&s;e his e&s;|tate con&s;iderably. He was e&s;teemed more and more by tho&s;e who knew him, both for his good nature and his hone&s;ty. Indeed he was good and kind to every body, and helped poor folks all he could. It was in this pro&s;perous &s;tate of Robert's affairs, that Hugh arrived in America. His pride was too great to &s;uffer him to go directly to his brother for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He therefore went to his old practice of gaming; but with &s;uch poor &s;ucce&s;s that he &s;oon lo&s;t the few &s;hillings that he had. His brother knew nothing of his return yet.&mdash;"O no, I dare &s;ay he did not know it, daddy, &s;aid, the little Mary, who had been all this time li&s;t|ening
<PB N="150" REF="025609_0148_0FCE111AB38525E0">
with great attention, for if he had known how poor he was he would have given him &s;omething tho' he was wicked."&mdash;Yes, my dear, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, he cer|tainly would, for people mu&s;t have &s;ome|thing to live upon if they are bad, that they may have opportunity to grow better."&mdash;This poor unhappy creature was now re|duced to the la&s;t farthing, and knew not which way to turn to get any thing to eat. In this dreadful condition he thought he would go and make him&s;elf known to his brother, who he knew had plenty of every thing. But he determined to try his luck once more, at one of tho&s;e low hou&s;es where wicked people re&s;ort to game and drink and carou&s;e all night. He had not been here long before he had a dreadful quarrel with one of his wicked companions, his &s;pirits being rai&s;ed by liquor. They &s;oon went from words to blows, but his antagoni&s;t was too mighty for him and gave him &s;uch a brui&s;ing that he ran into the &s;treet, and cried out murder! murder! Robert, who hap|pened to be pa&s;&s;ing in that part of the town, ju&s;t at this time, hearing this outcry, went that way, and &s;eeing &s;everal people ru&s;h out of the hou&s;e, he &s;eized the fir&s;t per&s;on he could catch, and draged him to a light.
<PB N="151" REF="025609_0149_0FCE111CA9E893A0">
He was &s;o dirty and bloody that Robert did not know who he was, nor did he once think that his brother was in this country. But as &s;oon as they came to the light, Hugh knew him, by a mark acro&s;s his chin by the kick of a hor&s;e when he was a child, and in|&s;tantly cried out, Oh my brother, my broth|er!&mdash;Robert was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear the voice of his brother Hugh, which he perfectly recollected, tho he had not &s;een him for many years. He took him immediately to his hou&s;e, and &s;ent for a &s;urgeon to dre&s;s his wounds. He &s;oon got well of tho&s;e by the great care and tenderne&s;s of his brother. His kindne&s;s had a good effect on Hugh for a while, and he was in hope that it might reform him.&mdash;"Did not he grow good, daddy, &s;aid the little Jo&s;eph, after his brother was &s;o good to him?"&mdash;"You will hear pre&s;ently my &s;on, replied Mr. Worthy, what effect it had upon him; but I can a&s;&s;ure you Jo&s;e, that if it is hard making bad boys become good, it is &s;till harder making bad men become better, becau&s;e they have been bad &s;o long, that they can hardly ever be turned away from their bad cour&s;es, and therefore it is very dangerous being bad boys."</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="025609_0150_0FCE111DD4ACFBE8">
"Mr. Robert Hamilton was doing a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s at this time, and wanted an a&s;&s;i&s;tant. He told his brother Hugh that he he &s;hould be welcome to continue in his hou&s;e; and that he would give him good wages if he would for&s;ake his wicked com|panions, and be &s;teady to bu&s;ine&s;s. He &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the offer, and promi&s;ed fair. His brother furni&s;hed him with good clothes, and &s;ome money. But it was not long before he returned to his old ways, and became wor&s;e than ever. His brother often talked to him about his conduct, advi&s;ed him to have more regard to his reputation, to con|&s;ider the con&s;equences of his conduct both in this world and in that which is to come. He would not regard the good advice of his brother nor any of his friends, but became tired of their dry preaching, as he called it, and determined to return to Scotland again, in hopes that his uncle, who was now dead, had left him &s;ome part of his e&s;tate. He em|barked on board a &s;hip as a private hand. They had a bad &s;torm on the pa&s;&s;age, when they thought that every &s;oul would have per&s;hed. Hugh was in dreadful di&s;tre&s;s, and reproach|ed him&s;elf bitterly for his conduct, which had driven him away from a place where he might have been very happy. The &s;torm
<PB N="153" REF="025609_0151_0FCE111F4D89AED8">
abated, and the &s;ea was again calm; but the &s;torm in his mind continued, and he was terribly agitated to think what a life he had lived. His trouble was renewed, and en|crea&s;ed &s;everal days afterwards, for when they had gotten near to the place where they were going, a wor&s;e &s;torm than the other aro&s;e, and it being very dark the &s;hip &s;truck the rocks, and poor Hugh Hamilton was da&s;hed to pieces among them." Jo&s;eph's little heart was ready to bur&s;t at the con|clu&s;ion of the &s;tory; and he &s;aid he was re|&s;olved never to play with Billy Hiller any more.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Mr. Worthy purcha&s;es books for his children&mdash;cultivates tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of heart&mdash;an affecting &s;tory of Jimmy the Rover.</HEAD>
<P>FARMER Worthy u&s;ed to &s;ay in the circle of his neighbors, "we farmers know that the ground mu&s;t be tilled, and good &s;eed mu&s;t be &s;own, if we expect to reap a crop. The &s;ame thing is true, &s;aid he, of our chil|dren. If we expect them to bear good fruit when they are grown up, we mu&s;t give them good in&s;truction, and govern them well now, while the &s;eeds of future conduct are &s;owing in their hearts." The ob&s;ervation was very ju&s;t and well applied. He accord|ingly took care to u&s;e various methods of in|&s;tructing and impre&s;&s;ing the minds of his children with virtuous principles. The method which he found mo&s;t plea&s;ing, as well as u&s;eful, was to furni&s;h them with books containing &s;tories of a moral tendency. The&s;e, he ob&s;erved, often left deep impre&s;|&s;ions on the mind, becau&s;e they intere&s;t
<PB N="155" REF="025609_0153_0FCE11247645B8F8">
the feelings of the heart, while the narrative inclines them to read. He therefore never begrudged the money he laid out for books, but purcha&s;ed many. From the&s;e he could collect a variety of u&s;eful and entertaining &s;tories, &s;uited to the different ages of his chil|dren. The&s;e he would &s;ometimes read to them, &s;ometimes cau&s;e them to read; and at other times would repeat &s;uch &s;tories as had come to his knowledge, which had a ten|dency to take hold of the heart. To the&s;e narratives his children would li&s;ten with great attention. Sometimes the tear of &s;en&s;ibility would &s;teal down their little cheeks at the tale of woe. At other times their hearts would dilate with joy, and the eye &s;parkle with plea&s;ure on a change of the &s;cene. By taking hold of their fine feelings in this man|ner, the heart was preparing for the di&s;|charge of that great chri&s;tian precept&mdash;"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep them that do weep."</P>
<P>One evening, as &s;everal of the children returned from a vi&s;it to a neighbor's child|ren at &s;ome di&s;tance, they found their fa|ther reclining on the &s;ettle which &s;tood near the kitchen door, much fatigued with the labor of the day. They flocked around him, eager to relate what they had &s;een. That
<PB N="156" REF="025609_0154_0FCE1126F3B65B88">
which had excited their curio&s;ity mo&s;t of all, was the pranks, and &s;trange talk of one Peggy Cummin, an Iri&s;h girl, who lived at Mr. Spencer's where they had been. Peggy had been a girl of good character, but being vi&s;|ited by a young man who wickedly pretend|ed that he was very fond of her, and as &s;oon as he could get into a way to live, would marry her, &s;he inadvertently gave way to his in&s;inuations, and then he left her in a &s;itu|ation truly deplorable. This took &s;uch deep hold on her mind that &s;he became delirious, and the town engaged Mr. Spencer to take care of Peggy and her child. The children &s;eemed greatly affected at the &s;ight of her, and could hardly tell how &s;he talked, and acted, and &s;obbed, without &s;hedding tears. When Mr. Worthy had heard them out, he &s;aid that if he were not &s;o very much fa|tigued, he would relate to them the &s;tory of Jimmy the Rover, who run crazy, and lived in the cave of Vanhine, in the back parts of Penn&s;ylvania. He told them, however, that they mu&s;t be patient with him till the next evening, and then he would gratify them with his affecting &s;tory.</P>
<P>The next evening, being reminded of his promi&s;e, he related the following account of James Mackormick, who came to this coun|try
<PB N="157" REF="025609_0155_0FCE1128C9858FA0">
to &s;eek his fortune. "He was indu&s;tri|ous, and pro&s;pered &s;o well that he married a very worthy de&s;erving girl, who had lived &s;ometime with Mrs. Vanhime, a very charit|able gentlewoman, who lived in a little town on the banks of the Delaware. He after|wards removed to another part of the coun|try, where he hoped to do better for him&s;elf, than where he then was. He &s;ucceeded quite well for &s;ome time, but meeting with &s;everal misfortunes, and his family fa&s;t en|crea&s;ing, he got involved, and the heirs of his creditor, who happened to die about this time, thru&s;t him into a loath&s;ome jail. This happened at a time when his wife was ill, and in con&s;equence of it became very dan|gerou&s;ly &s;ick. She went be&s;ide her&s;elf, and died not long after. To her death followed the death of his two younge&s;t children, one of them but an infant. The&s;e misfortunes drove him into a &s;tate of di&s;traction, and they relea&s;ed him from confinement. He &s;aid, "I have no home&mdash;the earth is my home. I will go up and down in it, till I find a cave where human foot will not come." He &s;tiled him&s;elf Jimmy the Rover. He wan|dered about from place to place, with his two remaining children, whom he called Venona and Penelope.&mdash;At length, in his
<PB N="158" REF="025609_0156_0FCE112B373C6180">
wanderings, he di&s;covered a deep cave under &s;ome rocks. This was not a very great di&s;|tance from the place where he had married his lovely Sylvia, as he always called his wife, when he &s;poke of her. Here he determin|ed to take up his abode. He called it the cave of Vanhime, after the name of the gen|tlewoman with whom his wife had lived. The pa&s;s into this cave was narrow. It was only large enough to contain him and his two children, and his faithful dog, who had long been the companion of his poverty. He would frequently wander all day about in the woods, while the children went to the lit|tle town not far off, to beg &s;ome provi&s;ion for their poor old daddy and them&s;elves. In the night they would lodge by their haple&s;s father." "What, &s;tay there all night daddy, &s;aid Henry?" "Yes, I believe they did, &s;aid the little Jo&s;eph. I am &s;ure I would not leave my daddy alone if he was poor and &s;ick." "nor I neither, &s;aid Dorcas," "nor I, nor I, &s;aid they all."&mdash;Venona and Penelope were dutiful children, continued Mr. Wor|thy, and could not be per&s;uaded to leave him. One day they went to the place where the gentlewoman lived, that I men|tioned before, not knowing any thing of her them&s;elves, but the dog knew her, though
<PB N="159" REF="025609_0157_0FCE112C0EC99D30">
he had not been that way for many years. She inquired their names, and found their place of retirement. This good lady fur|ni&s;hed them with many nece&s;&s;aries, and a&s;ked them if they would come and live with her. They thanked her, but &s;aid their daddy would be left alone if they did, and they could not leave him.&mdash;"Good children, &s;aid the good lady, you mu&s;t take good care of your daddy." She &s;ent for him to come to her hou&s;e. He came, but was not to be per&s;uaded out of his way of life. The &s;mall pox came about. His two children caught it. They were carried to an ho&s;pital&mdash;they died&mdash;he &s;aw them ga&s;ping for breath&mdash;yes, he &s;aw them expire&mdash;he wrung his hands&mdash;he could not &s;peak&mdash;he could not &s;hed a tear, his heart was too full.</P>
<P>After his children were buried, he vi&s;ited their graves daily. Here he poured out tears and lamentations to no purpo&s;e. Cur&s;o, his dog, always accompanied him in the&s;e gloomy vi&s;its. "Cur&s;o, &s;aid Jimmy, will never leave me." His &s;pirits began to fail him. He grew melancholy, and &s;eldom went fur|ther than the little town on the margin of the river. He would look at the river and &s;ay, "&s;o runs life as the water flows down." He called on Mrs. Vanhime. She would
<PB N="160" REF="025609_0158_0FCE112D9E534670">
have relieved him, but he would give to his dog whatever &s;he gave him for his own &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. Cur&s;o was unfortunately killed by an ill natured man who did not care whom he injured, nor how much he tortured ani|mals. This was the la&s;t &s;troke that could befal poor Jimmy the Rover. He betook him&s;elf to his cabin. Mrs. Vanhime kindly vi&s;ited him. She wept with him as he tried to relate his troubles&mdash;he grew more rational and calm. She offered him &s;ome nouri&s;h|ment&mdash;he would have taken it, but nature was too much exhau&s;ted. He &s;aid to her, with a &s;erene countenance, "Madam, I thank you for your goodne&s;s&mdash;you have been kind to me&mdash;you was &s;o to my dear Sylvia&mdash;&s;he is gone, I am going&mdash;God is ju&s;t&mdash;we &s;hall both be happy." Having &s;poke this, he ex|pired without a groan.</P>
<P>When Mr. Worthy had fini&s;hed this nar|rative he looked round and &s;aw all his little audience in tears; and plea&s;antly &s;aid to them, that though they might weep at the troubles and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of poor Jimmy; yet they had rea&s;on to rejoice in the happy ex|change he made, by dying in &s;o calm a man|ner. This compo&s;ed them in a good mea&s;ure; and a little affair took place &s;oon after, which gave birth to new in&s;tructions,

<HEAD>CHAP XIX. A little rupture takes place in the family&mdash;Mrs. Worthy interferes and bears te&s;timony again&s;t angry pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;their dangerous tendency illu&s;trated in the &s;tory of Cate Smithers.</HEAD>
<P>AFFECTING as the &s;tory of Jim|my the Rover was, a little affair took place not long after, which occa&s;ioned a rupture between the two younge&s;t &s;i&s;ters. This conte&s;t was about a trifle, indeed; but they di&s;covered &s;o much anger that Mrs. Wor|thy interpo&s;ed, and by her prudent manage|ment &s;oon &s;ettled the di&s;pute. They look|ed very much a&s;hamed, when they come to think what they had been doing, and would gladly have gone out of &s;ight of the family. But Mrs. Worthy &s;aid to them, in an affec|tionate manner, I perceive you are both a&s;hamed of your folly, and I am glad to &s;ee it. I pity you becau&s;e you puni&s;h your|&s;elves. Had you, my dear, addre&s;&s;ing her|&s;elf to the elder of the two contending &s;i&s;ters, given way to your little &s;i&s;ter's humor, there
<PB N="163" REF="025609_0161_0FCE113569B55E40">
would have been propriety in your conduct. You would have &s;hown that being older, you were wi&s;er al&s;o. Then turning to the younger &s;he &s;aid, My father u&s;ed to &s;ay&mdash;"He that gives a blow does not begin an af|fray, but he that returns it."&mdash;If you had given up what you thought was your's, when your &s;i&s;ter contended for it, you would have &s;hown that you had a mind &s;uperior to her, though you are younger. I hope, continued Mrs. Worthy, that neither of you will be guilty of the &s;ame folly any more; and added, that the fate of Cate Smithers was enough to convince any body of the folly and danger of indulging angry pa&s;&s;ions. She lived in a town where my father u&s;ed to be called on bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ometimes; and I will take an opportunity to tell it to you as he u&s;ed to do to us."</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was all this time &s;ilent, but was much plea&s;ed with what his wife &s;aid on this occa&s;ion, and al&s;o with the manner in which &s;he treated the &s;ubject. But as Mrs. Worthy had undertaken to root out this vicious pa&s;&s;ion, he did not interfere. She accordingly took a favorable opportunity to relate to her children what her father had formerly told to his family of one Cate Smithers, a remarkable ill natured girl, who
<PB N="164" REF="025609_0162_0FCE113754D943D8">
made her&s;elf and every body about her un|happy, by means of her ill humor and angry pa&s;&s;ions. As her children were all around her one evening, when the moon &s;hone bright and the air was remarkably &s;erene, &s;upper being ju&s;t cleared away, &s;he related the fol|lowing circum&s;tances concerning her.</P>
<P>Cate, &s;aid Mrs. Worthy, was not only an only daughter, but an only child. Her fond mother would not &s;uffer her to be con|tradicted in any thing. Cate was not very good humored naturally, but her temper and di&s;po&s;ition were made ten times wor&s;e by indulgence. Being always u&s;ed to have every thing give way to her humor, &s;he could not bear any inconvenience or contradiction. She would fly into a mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion if &s;he could not have every thing &s;he wanted. When &s;he was quite a child, if &s;he fell down, her mother would beat the floor. This taught her to revenge, and to &s;trike and kick every thing that &s;tood in the way. She could not look pretty becau&s;e her &s;pirits were &s;o often &s;tirred up by every trifle, that &s;he looked &s;our and cro&s;s. So that Cate Smi|thers, who might have been very hand&s;ome, was very homely, by rea&s;on of her being &s;o often angry; and no body liked her. She was forever fretting and complaining. Every
<PB N="165" REF="025609_0163_0FCE1138DB076348">
thing appeared wrong to her becau&s;e &s;he was not right her&s;elf. Her anger would take fire on every trivial occa&s;ion, and &s;he kept the hou&s;e mo&s;t of the time in a broil. This was a great trouble to her mother; but her pa&s;&s;ions had now &s;o got the upper hand, that there was no &s;topping them. At length her doating mother began to find her health decline. The weight of evils brought upon her by the ill humor of Cate, made her grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e.&mdash;"O mamma, &s;aid Margrett, what a wicked girl mu&s;t &s;he be to afflict her poor mother &s;o?" "Girls are always naughty, &s;aid Mrs. Wor|thy, when they afflict their mothers by any bad conduct, e&s;pecially by indulging them|&s;elves in anger." Margrett felt the re|proof and &s;aid no more. "Cate's mother, continued Mrs. Worthy, fell under the weight of tho&s;e evils. She died, lamenting that her poor unhappy daughter had not died at the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>What would not Cate have given now that &s;he could undo the evil &s;he had occa|&s;ioned? She was left without a friend in the world. She was hated by all who lived in the hou&s;e; but did not long &s;urvive her mother to &s;uffer the wretchedne&s;s of her con|dition in this world. It was very difficult
<PB N="166" REF="025609_0164_0FCE113CA2C07FE8">
with all her money, of which &s;he had enough, to prevail with any nur&s;e to take care of her in her la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;o often angry with them. No body re|gretted&punc; her death. Not a tear was &s;hed at her grave; and the only benefit her memory can be to the world is to warn every body again&s;t indulging angry pa&s;&s;ions."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Fal&s;hood detected and reproved&mdash;in&s;tances of the di&s;advantages of it in Henry Bramble and Jane Barnwell.</HEAD>
<P>IT was by the&s;e gentle and in&s;tructive mea&s;ures, that Mrs. Worthy &s;ettled the little di&s;putes which at any time aro&s;e in the fa|mily; &s;o that there was no noi&s;e or tumult, as is the ca&s;e in many families when a little jarring takes place between the children, which will be the ca&s;e in all families. Mr. Worthy guarded the morals of his children with equal care, and when he di&s;covered a di&s;po&s;ition in any of them to violate the truth, or to be unfaithful, he endeavored to make them a&s;hamed of it. He had been abroad on a certain occa&s;ion for a few days, and on his return home he found &s;ome mi&s;chief had been done. When he came to inquire into it, he di&s;covered a di&s;po&s;ition in one of his &s;ons, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed was in fault, to evade the truth; and though he did not tell a po&s;itive fal&s;hood, yet he attempted to de|ceive. This was very di&s;plea&s;ing to Mr.
<PB N="168" REF="025609_0166_0FCE113FDBB458A0">
Worthy, who always practi&s;ed and enjoined the &s;tricte&s;t integrity. He cea&s;ed therefore to inquire any further into the matter for the pre&s;ent; but took an early opportunity to &s;peak to his children on the importance of &s;peaking the truth. He dwelt on the ba&s;e|ne&s;s of all attempts to deceive. "An at|tempt to make another believe what was not true, he &s;aid, con&s;tituted the crime of fal&s;|hood, and was very offen&s;ive to him who knows every thing that pa&s;&s;es in the human heart." He &s;poke with &s;uch warmth, and great in|dignation, on the &s;ubject of deceiving, by which he &s;aid he meant fal&s;hood, that it was not long before the guilty boy di&s;covered his guilt by blu&s;hing, and an evident per|turbation of mind. When Mr. Worthy &s;poke &s;o pointedly of the ba&s;ene&s;s of lying, and of its dangerous tendency both in this world and in that which is to come; he could not help di&s;covering an unea&s;ine&s;s that marked him to be the guilty one. "I am glad," &s;aid Mr. Worthy, addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to him&mdash;"I am glad to perceive this confu&s;ion which a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your guilt has thrown you into."&mdash;The lad bur&s;t into tears, and confe&s;&s;ed the fact.&mdash;Mr. Worthy cea&s;ed to &s;ay any thing more directly to him. But went on to ob&s;erve to his children, that
<PB N="169" REF="025609_0167_0FCE1141442D36C0">
"to &s;peak the truth, always was noble and honorable; that truth was like good coin, it would pa&s;s every where; and that fal&s;ehood was like counterfeit money that would &s;oon be detected, and would not pa&s;s any where."</P>
<P>This truth, he &s;aid, might be e&s;tabli&s;hed by many in&s;tances; but one he particularly alluded to was, the unfortunate Henry Bram|ble, who &s;uffered &s;o much from the habit of telling fal&s;ehoods that he was obliged to leave it off for his own &s;afety. One day as he pa&s;&s;ed his father's field, he &s;aw a number of cattle breaking into it. He ran to call &s;ome boys, who were going to the river to &s;wim, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in driving them out; but the boys would not go, &s;aying "we don't believe a word of it; he is only going to make fools of us." He continued to &s;ay that it was true, and per&s;i&s;ted in it with &s;o much earn|e&s;tne&s;s that at la&s;t he prevailed on them to go with him, but he had been &s;o long in gaining credit with them, that the cattle had nearly de&s;troyed the corn. He &s;uffered great di&s;advantage on &s;everal accounts; for he became &s;o notoriou&s;ly bad at length, that his ma&s;ter could not believe one word he &s;aid, and forbid the boys of the &s;chool to play with him. This made him a&s;hamed of him&s;elf, and &s;eemed to effect &s;ome reforma|tion;
<PB N="170" REF="025609_0168_0FCE114394677708">
but that which brought him to be &s;en|&s;ible of the danger of &s;uch practices was the conduct of John Briggs, a &s;tout boy, who was offended at Henry for &s;ome fal&s;ehoods he had told about him. John took the opportunity to waylay Henry as he was going to &s;chool, and gave him a &s;ound flog|ging. Henry was no match for John, and therefore did not attempt to return the blows, but threatened to tell the ma&s;ter&mdash;"Tell him, tell him, &s;ays John, if you dare, and he will flog you for lying."&mdash;John took the advan|tage of this part of Henry's character to gratify his revenge upon him &s;everal times. Henry bore it with as much patience as he could, for &s;ome time. At la&s;t he made complaint to his father of the abu&s;es he re|ceived from John Briggs. Henry's father went to John's parents to complain of the abu&s;es his &s;on received. Without ever in|quiring into the truth of the ca&s;e, they told him that "there was no believing one word that Henry &s;aid." This was indeed a very painful reply, but it was all he could get; and John continued beating Henry till he had obtained full &s;atisfaction for the injury he had received from him. After this Henry grew more cautious of &s;peaking fal&s;ehood; and continued to tell the truth till he re|covered
<PB N="171" REF="025609_0169_0FCE1145FADC09F8">
his character, and found by his own experience, that truth was not only more natural and ea&s;y, but al&s;o more plea&s;ing and delightful than fal&s;ehood." He al&s;o re|minded them of the &s;tory of Jane Barnwel, who was always inventing fal&s;e &s;tories. If &s;he had broken any thing, &s;he would lay it to the cat or the dog, if it were any mi&s;chief that they could do, and they were beaten for her faults. Sometimes &s;he would lay it to the &s;ervants, and they mu&s;t &s;uffer for her fal&s;e|hoods. This made them hate her, and &s;he was de&s;pi&s;ed by all who knew her, for &s;uch conduct.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. The genero&s;ity of Charles toward Edward Fleming, who had injured him.&mdash;Mr. Worthy's conduct on this occa&s;ion, a good model for imitation.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING could be more plea&s;ing to Mr. Worthy or to his wife, than to &s;ee their children avoiding tho&s;e vices which tarni&s;h human nature, and acting on tho&s;e good principles which they had in&s;tilled in|to their minds. How highly then mu&s;t they have been gratified at the generous conduct of their &s;on Charles, toward Ed|ward Fleming, who was a very great rogue, and lived in the &s;ame town. He was called Rogue Ned, by all the boys, on account of his being full of rogui&s;h tricks. His mo|ther was a widow, and unable to manage him. It was a great grief to her that he did not incline to learn at &s;chool, nor to go with her to public wor&s;hip. This boy was about the age of Charles Worthy, who was a lad of a noble, generous mind, and &s;corned a little thing. Though Ned &s;ometimes treat|ed
<PB N="173" REF="025609_0171_0FCE1149C0383A88">
him ba&s;ely, and &s;tole his things, yet Charles never troubled his mother with any com|plaints again&s;t him. One day as Charles was pa&s;&s;ing where Ned was throwing &s;tones and playing the fool, he threw a &s;tone at Charles, probably not with an intention to injure him, but to gratify his rogui&s;h humor. The &s;tone however &s;truck him near the tem|ple, and though the wound was not deep, yet it bled profu&s;ely, and gave him &s;ome pain. Charles hurried home, and coming in all bloody, affrighted his mother exceedingly. But Charles endeavored to make light of it, and &s;aid, "he did not think that Ned meant to hurt him; and he did not doubt but it would &s;oon be well," and &s;o it proved.</P>
<P>It happened not long after this affair, that, as Charles was pa&s;&s;ing a piece of woods on his way to mill, he heard a &s;udden outcry, and a rattling among the limbs of the trees. He was frighted at fir&s;t, but hearing &s;ome|body call, as if in di&s;tre&s;s, he jumped from his hor&s;e and ran towards the place, where he found Ned in a dreadful &s;ituation. This arch rogue was &s;ent on an errand by his mother, but in&s;tead of going as he was directed, he went after bird's eggs. In this wicked de|parture from his duty, he met with this di&s;|a&s;ter, for having ventured too far out upon
<PB N="174" REF="025609_0172_0FCE114B252844A0">
a limb after a bird's ne&s;t, the limb broke and down came the haple&s;s boy much to his injury. Charles, like a humane, tender hearted lad, &s;howed great concern for his misfortune, and with much difficulty helped him to get upon his own hor&s;e, and carried him home to his mother. Mrs. Fleming was &s;o affected with the &s;ituation of her undutiful &s;on, and with the genero&s;ity of Charles, that &s;he well nigh fainted away. The afflicted mother could not help exclaim|ing, "This is really doing good for evil." On Charles's arrival home he related what had pa&s;&s;ed, and in the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate &s;train begged his father to &s;end &s;omething for the relief of the poor woman, and for Ned too. Mr. Worthy highly applauded this generous conduct of his &s;on; and a&s;|&s;ured him that to do good for evil, was the be&s;t retaliation in the world; and that the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done a benevolent action, would always be the be&s;t cordial for every painful &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>Agreeably to Mr. Worthy's u&s;ual practice, when he knew of any one in di&s;tre&s;s, he went to &s;ee what a&s;&s;i&s;tance Mrs. Fleming needed, and to vi&s;it the wicked boy, in hopes of making &s;ome good impre&s;&s;ions on his mind, by means of his bodily &s;ufferings. Mr. Worthy had
<PB N="175" REF="025609_0173_0FCE114D68E3A6C0">
tried before to reclaim him, but his attempts had hitherto been in vain. In hopes that he could now &s;often his heart, he carried him &s;ome comforting things, &s;uch as his pre|&s;ent &s;tate required. His goodne&s;s was re|ceived with gratitude by Mrs. Fleming. She was loud in the prai&s;es of his &s;on Charles, and &s;aid &s;he would give the world if Ed|ward po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame temper. Mr. Wor|thy took the opportunity to &s;ay many things to him on the &s;ubject of being dutiful to his mother, and of behaving well to every body. After &s;aying what he thought proper to Ed|ward, he returned home. It was on this occa&s;ion that his heart overflowed with grat|itude to heaven for the dome&s;tic ble&s;&s;ings he enjoyed; for when he came in, he found Mrs. Worthy &s;urrounded by her children, who were employed in working or reading. He offered up an ejaculation at the plea&s;ing &s;ight, and ble&s;t the God of the families of the earth, for his un&s;peakable goodne&s;s in granting him &s;o many lovely and dutiful children. Seating him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of his dome&s;tic circle, he &s;poke to them con|cerning the duty and plea&s;ure of humanity and charity. "What plea&s;ure, &s;ays he, does it afford, to relieve our fellow creatures in di&s;tre&s;s, to &s;ee their &s;orrow turned into joy?
<PB N="176" REF="025609_0174_0FCE114E97B48310">
The duty, he ob&s;erved, was founded in the common nature of man, and their common relation to the Creator, and the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;charging it, he &s;aid, aro&s;e from the liable|ne&s;s all are in to the &s;ame di&s;a&s;ters." He particularly mentioned that "this was a duty that &s;hould be exerci&s;ed not only to friends and acquaintance, but to all without di&s;|tinction. However di&s;agreeable others may be to us, or however unthankful, yet when troubles come upon them, we are bound to pity and relieve them."</P>

<P>THE tran&s;ition from humanity, to tenderne&s;s to animals, is &s;o ea&s;y and natural, that Mr. Worthy renewed the &s;ubject, after being interrupted a while, and ob&s;erved that tenderne&s;s to animals was connected with genero&s;ity and humanity.

<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations and many others of a like nature, which Mr. Worthy made, were very ju&s;t, and &s;howed him to be a man who thought and reflected a great deal; they were founded in nature, and were agreeable to the &s;cripture. Other animals only think of them&s;elves; but man is allowed to retrace the image that God fir&s;t implanted in him. He feels the warmth of devotion, of which the animals appear to have no &s;en&s;e. He feels a generous love unfelt by them. Every part of creation affords an exerci&s;e for vir|tue, and con&s;equently a &s;ource of plea&s;ure to him.&mdash;In&s;ects, birds, and animals, all en|joy what their beneficent Creator gives them. As they receive their exi&s;tence and &s;upport from the &s;ame fountain from which we derive our's, it mu&s;t be our duty to avoid hurting them, to thank him for what we receive, and to imitate him in doing good.</P>
<P>Then &s;hall we prove that we are &s;incere, when we pray to him; but we only affront him when we pray to him, and do not &s;trive to imitate his perfections, which he every where di&s;plays for our imitation, that we

may grow better and happier. Mr. Wor|thy, who had trea&s;ured up many u&s;eful ob|&s;ervations from his own knowledge, as well as many anecdotes from books, ob&s;erved that "at Mr. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word">'s they &s;eem to take plea&s;ure in tormenting every thing that falls in their way. Tho&s;e mu&s;t &s;urely have a bad heart who can delight in &s;uch things, in hurting and afflicting every creature that comes within their power. Such people can't be capable of much humanity. In|deed, continued Mr. Worthy, I have either read or heard of a man who was puni&s;hed in his own way for indulging this ba&s;e temper. He not only practi&s;ed cruelty to animals to a high degree, but al&s;o on his own family. He &s;eemed to delight in nothing &s;o much as in tantalizing them, and &s;eeing them mi&s;era|ble. He neglected the education of his children, and was an example of cruelty be|fore them. The con&s;equence was, that when he became old and unable to help him&s;elf, they neglected him. He grew old and fee|ble, but found no relief nor &s;upport from them; nay, they had no pity for him. He went &s;taggering about under the weight of his infirmities, which were the effect of his vices, e&s;pecially his cruelty, till at length he fell
<PB N="180" REF="025609_0178_0FCE11560AB77438">
into a ditch, and expired in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable condition.</P>
<P>"The &s;trength of affection that appears in &s;ome animals toward their young, Mr. Worthy further ob&s;erved, &s;hows the ba&s;ene&s;s of cruelty toward them. This, &s;aid he, is illu&s;trated in a mo&s;t &s;triking manner, in the following in&s;tance:&mdash;A dog which had all her litter taken away from her and drowned, (which, indeed, &s;eems the ea&s;ie&s;t way of di&s;patching them when it is nece&s;&s;ary) found out where they were thrown, and brought them one by one, and laid them at the feet of her cruel ma&s;ter&mdash;&s;he looked af|fectionately at them for &s;ome time, in dumb angui&s;h, then turning her eyes on the de&s;|troyer&mdash;&s;he expired."</P>
<P>The heart of a child, who is early bred to treat animals with tenderne&s;s, will be hu|manized at the period when, like wax, it takes every impre&s;&s;ion. Such an heart will be prepared to be an in&s;trument of much good to the world, when ripened by age. A child who is taught never wantonly to tread on an in&s;ect, nor to di&s;regard the ex|pre&s;&s;ive complaints of the &s;peechle&s;s bea&s;t, will not be able when grown up, to refu&s;e bread to the hungry, nor comfort to the af|flicted. Thus, while they are patronizing

the animal world, they are rendering them|&s;elves more u&s;eful to their fellow creatures, and laying in &s;tore for them&s;elves a good foundation again&s;t the time to come.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. In our mo&s;t pro&s;perous &s;tate we are liable to &s;udden changes&mdash;a di&s;tre&s;sful event throws a gloom over Mr. Worthy's hou&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Worthy filled up every page of life with &s;omething u&s;eful. While he taught his children, his grain was growing, and his herds were feeding; for he had not neglected any portion of that time which was nece&s;&s;ary to put the&s;e in their proper train. His early days had been attended with great difficulty, and every thing &s;eemed to go a|gain&s;t him. But the &s;cene had been chang|ed with him for a long time, and his pro&s;|perity &s;eemed &s;o fixed that he might begin to think with a good man of old, "that his mountain &s;tood &s;o &s;trong that it never could be moved." This is too commonly the ef|fect of continued pro&s;perity. It makes men &s;ecure. They are apt to think that tomorrow will be as today. It is po&s;&s;ible that this was the ca&s;e with Mr. Worthy, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould be reminded of the falibility of his condition.
<PB N="183" REF="025609_0181_0FCE115AA8E14178">
Be this as it may, he was taught by a &s;evere &s;troke, how frail he and his deare&s;t earthly enjoyments were. In the mid&s;t of his pro&s;perity, as he was &s;moothly &s;ailing down the current, a melancholy event took place which tried his fortitude as a man, and his re&s;ignation as a chri&s;tian&mdash;an event that &s;pread melancholy through the hou&s;e, and would have overwhelmed him and his wife with in&s;upportable grief, had they made no other provi&s;ion for an evil day than what worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions could afford. But to a good man nothing is evil but &s;in. The heart that is guarded by the exerci&s;es of pi|ety, is defended again&s;t the &s;harp arrows of affliction; and the tidings of evil, however &s;udden, do not &s;urpri&s;e it, becau&s;e it "is fixed, tru&s;ting in God."</P>
<P>Charles, now in the bloom of youth, as he was attempting to cro&s;s a mill pond fell in, and was drowned. The body was recover|ed with &s;ome difficulty; but there were no &s;igns of life. The tidings flew to his father and mother, who were thrown into great di&s;|tre&s;s. How then were they cut to the heart to &s;ee their beloved Charles brought in a lifele&s;s corp&s;e? No language can paint their di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;no heart conceive it, but &s;uch as have experienced the like! When they
<PB N="184" REF="025609_0182_0FCE115E2C5A37B0">
found every effort they made to recover him was in vain, they acquie&s;ced in the painful event, &s;aying, "The will of the Lord be done." They endeavoured to comfort their children, who were crying ready to break their hearts. This rational conduct of the parents had a good effect on the children, who followed their example in being quiet. Their conduct under this affliction was an example to all their neighbors. They were &s;en&s;ibly affected, indeed, by the death of &s;o amiable and promi&s;ing a &s;on; but they con&s;idered it as an event taking place under a wi&s;e Providence that ruleth over all, and as a proper trial of their chri&s;tian temper; and as they con&s;idered &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God to be a great chri&s;tian duty, &s;o they endeavored to be an example of it to all who &s;aw them.</P>
<P>The &s;olemnity with which the funeral was attended, was &s;uch as left a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of all who were pre&s;ent on the occa&s;ion, e&s;pecially the youth. Well might they be affected at the &s;ight of &s;o fine a flow|er cut down, and withering beneath the &s;troke of death! They &s;aw that life is but a vapour that appeareth for a little while and then vani&s;heth away. They heard the voice of Providence &s;peaking to them in
<PB N="185" REF="025609_0183_0FCE115F10B8A7A8">
language louder than &s;evenfold peals of thunder&mdash;"Be ye al&s;o ready, for the &s;on of man cometh at an hour ye think not of." The improvement which Mr. and Mrs. Worthy de&s;ired to make of this breech up|on their family, was to pay the more atten|tion to their remaining children, to be more careful than ever to "bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." This re&s;olution Mr. Worthy &s;ugge&s;ted to the clergyman, when on on a vi&s;it to his hou&s;e in con&s;equence of this affliction, who in reply to it, after &s;aying many comforta|ble things, ob&s;erved, that to &s;ea&s;on the pa&s;|&s;ions of youth with devotion is a mo&s;t im|portant article in their education. This is a &s;park, which if kindled in the mind at an early period, and con&s;tantly fanned by pa|rental care, will &s;eldom expire but with life. It may, indeed, appear to be extingui&s;hed for a time by the heats of youth, the allure|ments of vice, or the cares of the world; but will generally di&s;cover it&s;elf again, when age or misfortunes re&s;tore the mind to re|flection and con&s;ideration. Without devo|tion, what are the virtues of temperance, &s;o|briety and ju&s;tice, but qualities nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent &s;tate, and which men will prac|ti&s;e no longer than their own pre&s;ent con|venience

dictates? "Devotion," continued Mr. Villars, "opens the mind to great con|ceptions, fills it with &s;ublime ideas, and ex|tends it far beyond the regions of the mo&s;t exalted &s;cience, and &s;wells the &s;oul with the pure&s;t plea&s;ures. The mind being early in&s;pired with ju&s;t and high ideas of the maje&s;ty of God, and of his univer&s;al pre&s;ence, and often reimpre&s;&s;ed with this &s;en&s;e, will feel the full force of moral obli|gation. As naturally as the &s;prings that de&s;cend from the neighboring hills and &s;pread on the plains below, will produce fruit for the u&s;e of man; the child, thus trained, will feel its obligation to parents and to &s;ociety. Where the foundation is thus laid, &s;aid he, the &s;uper&s;tructure may be ea&s;ily rai&s;ed. Its ri&s;e and growth will be ob&s;erv|ed with delight. The child, thus trained, will be prepared to be incorporated into the body of men, whom it has been taught to treat with honor and re&s;pect; and will be able to di&s;charge the duties of that &s;tate of life to which he may be called in &s;ociety. As they are prepared in the be&s;t manner for the duties and enjoyments of life by a pious education, &s;o are they al&s;o prepared for death. That is, the parents have done all in their power to have their minds in

readine&s;s for &s;udden death, &s;hould it plea&s;e that God to whom they have been dedicat|ed, to take them away in that manner by death."&mdash;Mrs. Worthy melted into tears at this ob&s;ervation. Mr. Villars, ob&s;erving her trouble, only &s;aid, "Whatever may be their lot in the world, they mu&s;t be good, and endeavor to do good, if they would be happy either here or hereafter."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. Mr. Worthy vi&s;its Mr. Belmont&mdash;his recep|tion there&mdash;an affecting account of the death of Selina Belmont, by another hand.</HEAD>
<P>THE tranquillity of the hou&s;e being re&s;tored, and the minds of the family com|po&s;ed, Mr. Worthy made a journey to&mdash;, where Mr. Belmont lived. As his bu&s;ine&s;s led him to this place, he re&s;olved on making Mr. Belmont a vi&s;it, this being the fir&s;t time of his going there &s;ince that gentleman's misfortune at his hou&s;e. Mr. Worthy had no doubt of a kind reception from him, but was not &s;o certain with regard to Mrs. Bel|mont. He was made acquainted with her haughty &s;pirit, while at his hou&s;e, and &s;up|po&s;ed that a plain farmer, coming into her fine hou&s;e on a vi&s;it, might not be very welcome. But as he had receiv|ed a very pre&s;&s;ing invitation from Mr. Belmont, both when he left his hou&s;e, and by letter afterwards, he ordered his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o as to make a tarry of a day or two in town. When he found a little lei&s;ure from bu&s;ine&s;s, he took the opportunity to call on Mr. Bel|mont, who received him with the greate&s;t
<PB N="189" REF="025609_0187_0FCE11674B53E700">
ho&s;pitality, and what &s;urpri&s;ed him, was that Mrs. Belmont &s;eemed equally glad to &s;ee him. The welcome was &s;o friendly that he could have no doubt of its &s;incerity. Tho they received him in the mo&s;t courteous manner, yet Mr. Worthy ob&s;erved a mel|ancholy appearance to which they were not accu&s;tomed. This accorded to his own feel|ings at this time. It recommended Mrs. Belmont to him very much; for her mind was ca&s;t in a milder form than when he &s;aw her la&s;t. Their conver&s;ation was of a tenor different from what he expected, for their hearts had been taught to feel by one of tho&s;e &s;trokes, which never fail to &s;often every pa&s;|&s;ion, as well as to teach the mo&s;t u&s;eful le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>After cond<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ing with Mr. Worthy on ac|count of the untimely death of his amiable little &s;on, Mr. Belmont told him that he was not alone in affliction. "Its arrows, &s;aid he, are thrown at others, and their &s;harp points, pierce the heart with many a pang. No &s;ituation in life is exempt from this; and if the effects of our grief were as la&s;ting as they are deep and affecting, their influ|ence would cea&s;e but with life it&s;elf. But altho the effects from the con&s;ideration of death are not con&s;tant and prevailing, yet
<PB N="190" REF="025609_0188_0FCE11699E6F2340">
the&s;e thoughts will frequently pre&s;s upon the imagination, however little influence they may have on the mind in their rece&s;s." But, he ob&s;erved, that he had no need of the aid of imagination, that he felt all he &s;aid; and you may this day, &s;aid he, be taught by a &s;ympathetic enjoyment, that "it is better to go to the hou&s;e of mourning, than to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting." Saying this, he invited Mr. Worthy to go with him into another room. On opening the door of a large hall, which was darken|ed by the window &s;hutters, there appeared in the centre of the room, a &s;hrouded corp&s;e&mdash;Mr. Worthy, who had not been made ac|quainted with the melancholy circum&s;tance, &s;tood amazed at it, and at the &s;triking con|tra&s;t between the elegance of the room, and the humilitating &s;tate of death.&mdash;"There," &s;aid Mr. Belmont&mdash;a tear &s;uddenly &s;tarting in his eye, and his voice faltering&mdash;"There are the remains of the be&s;t, the lovelie&s;t child that ever lived to ble&s;s, or died to af|flict a parent's heart."&mdash;He would have pro|ceeded, but fullne&s;s of grief prevented his utterance&mdash;Mr. Worthy &s;tood motionle&s;s, and gazed with &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment.&mdash;When Mr. Belmont had recovered him&s;elf &s;o far as to go on, he ob&s;erved to Mr. Worthy&mdash;
<PB N="191" REF="025609_0189_0FCE10B5F0BC1300">
"This is the dear child of whom you heard us &s;o often &s;peak when at your hou&s;e. It is the lovely Selina&mdash;my only daughter! But the will of the lord is done, and &s;he is no more!"&mdash;He cea&s;ed, and turned from the affecting &s;ight.&mdash;To behold a young lady of her accompli&s;hments, torn from the arms of her doating parents in the bloom of youth and beauty, was a &s;ight that overpowered the manly fortitude of Mr. Worthy. He turned away; and as he walked along, the tear of &s;ympathy ran down his cheek. He &s;eemed for a while to forget his own afflic|tion, and to be &s;wallowed up in that of Mr. and Mrs. Belmont. The following account of her character and death, with moral re|flections upon it, was given by another hand.</P>
<P>"On the twenty &s;econd in&s;tant, at three o'clock in the morning, departed this life, Mi&s;s Selina Belmont, in the twenty fir&s;t year of her age.&mdash;To the beauty of her per&s;on, and the excellence of her natural di&s;po&s;ition, parents equally indulgent and attentive, had done the fulle&s;t ju&s;tice. Nothing had been &s;pared that could have any tendency to ac|compli&s;h her per&s;on, or cultivate her mind. The attempts of her parents had been at|tended with that &s;ucce&s;s which they com|monly meet when not prevented by mi&s;tak|en

fondne&s;s, or untimely vanity. She re|ceived admiration with a grace, and received it from all who knew her. Notwith&s;tanding the poli&s;h of her education, and her admira|ble per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, &s;he appeared to the ignorant, una&s;&s;uming, and to the plain|e&s;t people, unaffected. Her death may be a&s;cribed to the exce&s;s of her benevolence. A violent fever, occa&s;ioned by her unremit|ing attention to a &s;ick friend, cut off her parent's hopes in a few days&mdash;hopes which were ripening to reward all their care! Such dome&s;tic di&s;tre&s;&s;es open the pa&s;&s;age to the keene&s;t &s;en&s;ibility. They touch the heart in the tendere&s;t manner. The parents were looking forward to more advanced age, when Selina's virtues would be their comfort. But, alas, Selina is no more! She died at a time when every tongue was eloquent in her prai&s;e. In her, centered the admiration of the fa&s;hionable, and the e&s;teem of the virtu|ous. She combined gracefulne&s;s with dig|nity in her deportment, in &s;uch a manner as to appear &s;uperior to tho&s;e with whom &s;he mixed; yet this &s;uperiority was &s;o tempered with mode&s;ty as not to excite either envy or jealou&s;y. The tran&s;ition was &s;o great and &s;udden, that it &s;eemed like the painting of a dream. But, alas, the melancholly

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. Mr. Worthy returns home with tokens of gratitude from Mr. and Mrs. Belmont. They &s;end books to his children, from which he collects u&s;eful &s;tories&mdash;The &s;tory of Lu|cinda and Almerina.</HEAD>
<P>THE heart was now &s;oftened by af|fliction, and gave &s;cope to the exerci&s;e of the natural principles, unob&s;tructed by pride and vanity. It was on this occa&s;ion, that Mrs. Belmont di&s;covered the operation of the natural &s;entiments of gratitude. Be&s;ides the declaration of her &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s to her hu&s;band, and her&s;elf, while at his hou&s;e, in which he was very lavi&s;h, &s;he beg|ged his acceptance of a pre&s;ent to his wife. He took it and thanked her for her polite|ne&s;s. They al&s;o pre&s;ented him &s;everal books from their daughter's library, for the children, be&s;ides &s;ome other little matters. On his arrival home he was received by his wife and children, with that open hearted cheerfulne&s;s, which is the be&s;t evidence of
<PB N="195" REF="025609_0193_0FCE1172C850EFD0">
affection. This always afforded him the greate&s;t plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. When he had di&s;po&s;ed his affairs, &s;o as to &s;it down with his family, he related over what he had &s;een. When he came to tell of his reception at Mr. Belmont's, it was very grateful to his wife. But when he came to the melancholly account of what he had &s;een, Mrs. Worthy li&s;tened with a tearful attention; and the children were bathed in tears, at hearing about the death of poor Mi&s;s Selina Bel|mont.</P>
<P>When Mr. Worthy came to open the budget for his wife, he found it to be a &s;ilk gown, which &s;he accepted thankfully. The books, and little matters for the children, were brought forth, and pre&s;ented them from Mr. and Mrs. Belmont. The&s;e they received with many thanks. They were delighted with their pre&s;ents; but Mrs. Worthy ap|peared mo&s;t gratified by the books. She ob&s;erved, that "the other things were de&s;igned to adorn the out&s;ide, but books will help the under&s;tanding; and, for my part, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hall be much better plea&s;ed with having your heads furni&s;h|ed well within, than adorned without.

To behave well, to &s;tudy to know your duty to God and man, to love one another, and to be indu&s;trious, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he preferred to all the adorning in the world without it."</P>
<P>While a lengthy dialogue was carrying on among the children, and between them and their mother, Mr. Worthy was looking over the books he had brought home. In one of them he happened to meet with a &s;tory that applied to the ob&s;er|vation Mrs. Worthy made, concerning im|proving the mind in knowledge and vir|tue, rather than adorning the body. "In order to convince you more thoroughly of the truth of the&s;e things, &s;aid Mr. Wor|thy, I will read you a pretty &s;tory of a good lady who had two daughters, one of whom was very fond of gay dre&s;s, the other was very differently di&s;po&s;ed. He then read as follows, while they li&s;tened with great eagerne&s;s.</P>
<P>"There lived in the city of Fair Haven, a very good lady, who be&s;ides &s;everal &s;ons, had two daughters. The&s;e were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very different di&s;po&s;itions. She early taught them that, "a meek and quiet &s;pi|rit" was the true ornament of a female. It
<PB N="197" REF="025609_0195_0FCE1175E9776EC8">
gave her pain to find that notwith&s;tanding all her in&s;tructions, Lucinda, her elde&s;t daughter, had a growing fondne&s;s for gay dre&s;s, and for fine things; but it afforded her great plea&s;ure to find that Almerina, her younge&s;t daughter, was a good little girl, and had rather give her money, and even all the clothes &s;he could &s;pare, to the poor, than buy fine things to adorn her per&s;on. This good lady ob&s;erving the&s;e things, began to think by what means &s;he could cure her eld|e&s;t daughter of this fooli&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, and in&s;pire her with the &s;ame kind and benevo|lent di&s;po&s;ition that generally actuated Al|merina. In order to effect &s;o de&s;irable an end, &s;he took them both with her to vi&s;it a poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed woman, who had called at her door for charity. This poor woman was &s;o wa&s;ted with poverty that &s;he could afford but little nouri&s;hment to her infant, which &s;eemed half &s;tarved. This charitable wo|man found that &s;he lived in a &s;mall tene|ment not far off, and that her hu&s;band had got reduced through misfortune. Mrs. Goodwin, for that was the name of this charitable lady, took pains to inform her&s;elf as to the character of this poor woman, and her hu&s;band, and the cau&s;es of their poverty.
<PB N="198" REF="025609_0196_0FCE1177DE18F0D8">
When &s;he was convinced that it was the misfortune, and not the faults of her hu&s;|band, that had reduced them, &s;he went the more cheerfully to their relief. Having ob|tained this &s;atisfaction, Mrs. Goodwin and her two daughters followed the poor woman through a dark alley into a cold dark half cellar, where the cheerful rays of the &s;un never came. The hu&s;band, pale and wan through pain and poverty, &s;at on a form near a few cinders, the only fuel they had. Two half naked children &s;at &s;hivering by his &s;ide. The la&s;t mor&s;el of bread was gone, and wretchedne&s;s in the extreme, &s;tared them in the face.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of &s;o much poverty greatly af|fected Mrs. Goodwin. She could not con|ceal the tear that &s;tole down her check on this occa&s;ion. Her daughters, who&s;e little hearts were touched with the tendere&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ion, bur&s;t into tears. It was on this oc|ca&s;ion, that Lucinda fir&s;t felt the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame for throwing away her money for the meere&s;t trifles, when there were &s;o many &s;uffering for want of food and raiment. Her mortification was much increa&s;ed when &s;he &s;aw how much joy Almerina's pre&s;ents occa&s;ioned in this abode of di&s;tre&s;s. Lu|cinda

begged her mamma to permit her to give the children &s;ome of her fine things; but &s;he was informed that her fine clothes could do them no good. This vi&s;it afford|ed much relief to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family, but Lucinda had the mortification of coming away without having contributed in the lea&s;t towards it. She &s;aw the poor little children thanking her mamma and her &s;i&s;ter for the good things they gave them, and heard the poor man and his wife be&s;towing their benedictions upon them as the authors of their &s;upport and comfort, while they looked &s;hy at her, and &s;eemed to &s;heer off from her.</P>
<P>When they had left this dreary abode, and were on their return home, Mrs. Good|win a&s;ked Lucinda which &s;he thought af|forded the greate&s;t enjoyment, the plea&s;ure of relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, or that which fine clothes gave. But without waiting an an&s;|wer, &s;he replied to her own que&s;tion&mdash;"I know your &s;entiments already. I &s;aw your feelings. I am &s;ure you wi&s;hed your orna|ments further, that you might have had &s;omthing to be&s;tow on the&s;e poor children. You &s;aw, my dear, how thankful they were, and how much plea&s;ure your &s;i&s;ter enjoyed
<PB N="200" REF="025609_0198_0FCE118CCA3213B0">
in relieving them." To all this Lucinda con&s;ented by a blu&s;h and a tear. Her mo|ther a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he had great plea&s;ure in hoping that this vi&s;it would have a la&s;t|ing good effect upon her mind, and told her that there were multitudes of poor crea|tures in as bad a condition as tho&s;e whom they had &s;een. Mrs. Goodwin a&s;&s;ured Lu|cinda that prodigality and genero&s;ity could not be indulged together; that in order to be generous and charitable, we mu&s;t u&s;e econ|omy with what we have; and that we may be able to relieve others, it is nece&s;&s;ary to deny our&s;elves. When we have done good to our fellow creature, and given relief to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, we may thank God that he has made us his in&s;truments of mercy to others, and commit our&s;elves to &s;leep with a &s;atisfaction that trifles never can afford. That is a narrow mind indeed that &s;aves only for it&s;elf, to gratify the fancy and in|dulge the appetite. The benevolent curb both, that they may give &s;cope to the noble feelings of the heart. Tho&s;e who &s;quander away their money, defraud the poor of their portion, and deprive them&s;elves of the plea|&s;ure of doing good. Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be u&s;eful, mu&s;t govern their de&s;ires, and mu&s;t

not wait for objects of charity to come to them, but mu&s;t &s;ometimes &s;earch them out. In the country, where we live in the &s;um|mer, poverty is not u&s;ually attended with &s;uch circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s as we have this day been witne&s;s to; but in great towns, many families may be found in a &s;ituation &s;imilar to theirs. How many of our fellow creatures are there pining away in poverty and &s;ickne&s;s, in dark and wretched places, for the want of tho&s;e things which the finery of others would procure?"&mdash;Lucinda wept at this la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, recollecting the mi&s;ery &s;he had &s;een, and that having laid out all her money for fine clothes, it was not in her power to afford the &s;ufferers any relief&mdash;"Yes, continued Mrs. Goodwin, there are many &s;ecluded from the public eye, groan|ing with pain, emaciated by &s;ickne&s;s, and made wretched by poverty, who might be relieved, and rendered happy by the money which the taudry finery of many co&s;t, over and above decent and good dre&s;s." The &s;tory being fini&s;hed, the tear of &s;en&s;ibility &s;tarted from the eyes of the children, and they exclaimed, as though actuated by one &s;oul&mdash;"I could work all day to relieve them, and give them poor folks my be&s;t clothes rather than they &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed." It

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. Mr. Worthy's ob&s;ervations on the improve|ment of time, e&s;pecially on farmers employ|ing their evenings and lei&s;ure hours&mdash;of e&s;|tabli&s;hing &s;ocial libraries&mdash;Mentor's ob&s;er|vations on diligence, indu&s;try and a proper u&s;e of time.</HEAD>
<P>I WOULD not be under&s;tood to &s;ug|ge&s;t that either Mr. or Mrs. Worthy were wholly without faults in the management of their children, or in the government of their own pa&s;&s;ions. They often erred in both re|&s;pects. But it would be an unplea&s;ant ta&s;k to relate the foibles of tho&s;e who are con&s;tant|ly endeavouring to correct them&s;elves. It was their uniform wi&s;h that their children might "be as plants grown up in their youth, and come forward on the &s;tage of action under the influence of &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions as would make them the mo&s;t u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, and mo&s;t happy in them&s;elves. They are certainly entitled to much credit for the exertions they u&s;ed to effect their wi&s;hes, and if they erred at any time it was
<PB N="204" REF="025609_0202_0FCE118143F33EE8">
not for want of good intentions. They had watched, with parental care and anxiety, the dawn of their children's minds, and ac|cording to the be&s;t of their judgment, had endeavoured to in&s;truct, impre&s;s, and regu|late them. They now began to &s;ee the good effects of their exertion in the elde&s;t, who were advancing towards that period in which more manly exerci&s;es were required, as their conduct appeared to be the effect of more mature judgment. The younge&s;t &s;till required the attention proper for child|ren.</P>
<P>To vary the mode of treatment towards children in the &s;everal &s;tages, from eight to eighteen, and make it &s;uitable to all the in|termediate periods, and al&s;o to accommo|date it to the different &s;exes, is a ta&s;k that re|quires great watchfulne&s;s, and con&s;tant ex|ertion. The&s;e parents were fully &s;en&s;ible of the difficulty. They often conver&s;ed up|on it between them&s;elves, and ob&s;erved it to others; and found that they were not a|lone in the opinion. Difficult as the ta&s;k may &s;eem, yet in ju&s;tice to them, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, they managed it with great &s;kill. To keep them out of idlene&s;s, and give them proper &s;entiments of the value of time, and a careful improvement of it, was con&s;idered
<PB N="205" REF="025609_0203_0FCE11824FDAA3B8">
an object of great importance both to their virtue and happine&s;s. Their ideas on this head extended not only to diligence in the u&s;ual hours of labor, but to a proper u&s;e of tho&s;e hours which we call lei&s;ure. There is much time lo&s;t under the notion of lei&s;ure hours. The diligent and indu&s;trious econ|omi&s;t of time will find but few &s;uch hours.</P>
<P>"Tho the &s;hortne&s;s of life, &s;aid Mr. Wor|thy, is often a &s;ubject of great complaint by many people, yet there are very few, who make a ju&s;t e&s;timate of time. He who con|&s;iders its value, and is de&s;irous to employ it to the be&s;t advantage, will find that he has none to lo&s;e in idlene&s;s; nor will it hang heavy on his hands. There are many lei|&s;ure hours in a farmer's life, in which he could make con&s;iderable improvements, were they employed in a way which his oc|cupation &s;eems to point out. The very bu&s;ine&s;s of the farmer leads him out of the way of much information, except what ari&s;es from his own ob&s;ervation. There are &s;ea|&s;ons al&s;o which his bu&s;ine&s;s naturally af|fords for his improvement in knowledge. Tho the&s;e may be con&s;idered as a &s;mall portion, when compared with the whole, or even with that part which many others have, yet the intervals of re&s;t and lei&s;ure which every farmer has, would amount to
<PB N="206" REF="025609_0204_0FCE1183D24EBCB0">
more time, and afford a greater opportunity than may be thought of by many. "If, &s;aid he, the farmers devote their long even|ings, &s;ome to dozing, and others to u&s;ele&s;s amu&s;ements, they loo&s;e the only &s;ea&s;on that &s;eems to be a&s;&s;igned them by the very nature of their occupation for improvement." The&s;e were ob&s;ervations which Mr. Wor|thy made to a neighboring farmer, who was often complaining of the &s;hortne&s;s of life. They were &s;o ju&s;t that he felt the force of them, and cea&s;ed grumbling for a while. Much of the unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content that appears in many, ari&s;es from ignorance, and the want of re&s;ource within them&s;elves. How much ea&s;ier would labor &s;eem, were the farmers to employ their lei&s;ure hours in furni&s;hing their minds with materials nece&s;|&s;ary to carry on reflection and meditation while at labor. The mechanic labors, and the &s;tudent applies to his literary pur&s;uits, many more hours in the twenty four than the farmer does in his bu&s;ine&s;s. The labor of the latter is generally the mo&s;t fatiguing to the body, but le&s;s &s;o to the mind. It is a truth, however, e&s;tabli&s;hed on experience, that "much &s;tudy is a weari&s;omene&s;s to the <HI>fle&s;h.</HI>" But when the hu&s;bandman retires from the labors of the field, his mind with
<PB N="207" REF="025609_0205_0FCE1185A90F6DC8">
his body is at re&s;t. If his mind was em|ployed in &s;ome plea&s;ing pur&s;uit, it might contribute greatly to the relief of the body. It is an old &s;aying, dictated by wi&s;dom, and found true by experience, that "a cheerful heart does good like a medicine," and it is an ob&s;ervation of equal truth, that knowledge is as grateful to the mind, as light to the eyes. How &s;oothing then mu&s;t a book of &s;entimental improvement and entertain|ment, be to one fatigued by labor. While the plea&s;ant light of the ri&s;ing &s;un of know|ledge, was exhilirating the &s;pirits by a me|chanical operation on the &s;y&s;tem, the fatigue of the body would be forgotten in the mid&s;t of brighter &s;cenes.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;ocial libraries in our towns and pari&s;hes would have a happy ten|dency to encourage reading, and cultivating the mind and manners of our fellow citizens. It is a fact that mu&s;t afford peculiar plea&s;ure to every well wi&s;her to &s;ociety, to arts, or to religion, that the&s;e are already encrea&s;ing in our country.</P>
<P>The&s;e might ea&s;ily be e&s;tabli&s;hed in every town, by the exertion of a few individuals, fir&s;t to collect &s;mall contributions from tho&s;e who would be di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;ociate for that purpo&s;e. This would bring together a collec|tion
<PB N="208" REF="025609_0206_0FCE1187F533ACB8">
of books, to the u&s;e of which each propri|etor would have an equal right under certain regulations. The advantage of having acce&s;s to a variety of books, greater than any indi|vidual could own, would &s;oon be felt. The entertainment from books would be encrea&s;|ed; and the time now &s;pent in u&s;ele&s;s and co&s;tly amu&s;ements, would much of it be em|ployed in reading. The &s;avings by this piece of economy would &s;oon reimbur&s;e the expen&s;es of the library, and make yearly additions to it. This would &s;urely be a very happy change in the mode of expen&s;es, and probably in the cour&s;e of a few years would be found to be a great &s;aving of them. In order to make reading a general thing, and to induce young people profitably to fill up their vacant hours, it is nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h children with books &s;uitable to their age, with which the world abounds, and train them up in the habit of reading them. If they are accu&s;tomed to improve their time well, they will read for the &s;ake of employ|ment, rather than be idle, and when reading has become a habit, the plea&s;ure of it will encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>"Diligence and indu&s;try, &s;aid Mentor to his young friend, are material duties of the young. To no purpo&s;e are they endowed

In youth, &s;aid he, the habits of indu&s;try are mo&s;t ea&s;ily acquired&mdash;in youth the incentives to it are &s;tronge&s;t, from am|bition and from duty, from emulation and hope, from all the pro&s;pects which the begin|ning of life affords. If, deaf to tho&s;e calls, you already langui&s;h in flothful inactivity, what will be able to quicken the more &s;lug|gi&s;h current of advancing life? Indu&s;try is not only the in&s;trument of improvement, but the foundation of plea&s;ure. Nothing is &s;o oppo&s;ite to the true enjoyment of life as the relaxed and feeble &s;tate of mind in the in|dolent. He who is a &s;tranger to indu&s;try, may po&s;&s;e&s;s, but he cannot enjoy. It is la|bor only which gives the reli&s;h to plea&s;ure. It is the appointed vehicle of every good to man. It is the indi&s;pen&s;able condition of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;ound mind in a &s;ound body. Sloth is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with both, that it is hard to determine whether it be a greater foe to virtue or to health and hap|pine&s;s. It not only &s;aps the foundation of every virtue, but pours upon you a del|uge

of crimes and evils.&mdash;Fly, therefore, &s;aid Mentor, fly from idlene&s;s, as the certain parent both of guilt and ruin. I mean, continued Mentor, under the head of idle|ne&s;s, to include all that circle of trifling oc|cupations in which too many &s;aunter away their youth, perpetually engaged in frivolous &s;ociety, or in u&s;ele&s;s amu&s;ements; in the labors of dre&s;s, or in the o&s;tentation of their per&s;ons.&mdash;Is this the foundation, my young friend, which you lay for future u&s;efulne&s;s and e&s;teem? By &s;uch accompli&s;hments, do you hope to recommend your&s;elf to the thinking part of the world, and to an&s;wer the expectations of your friends and your country? Amu&s;ements, indeed, are allowa|ble, they are nece&s;&s;ary for youth as the re|laxation, but culpable as the bu&s;ine&s;s of life. They then become the gulph of time, and the poi&s;on of the mind. They ferment bad pa&s;&s;ions. They weaken the manly powers. They &s;ink the native vigor of youth into contemptible effeminacy and unmanline&s;s.</P>
<P>From &s;uch dangerous wa&s;te of time, there|fore, redeem your time, and &s;eek to fill it with employments which you may review with &s;atisfaction. The acqui&s;ition of knowl|edge is one of the mo&s;t honorable occupa|tions of youth. The de&s;ire of it di&s;covers a

liberal mind, and is connected with many accompli&s;hments, and many virtues. But though your train of life &s;hould not lead you to &s;tudy, the cour&s;e of education always furni&s;hes proper employment to a well di&s;po&s;ed mind. Whatever you pur&s;ue be emulous to excel. Generous ambition, and &s;en&s;ibility to prai&s;e, are among the marks of virtue, e&s;pecially at your age.</P>
<P>"No rank or condition of life can exempt any one from the duties of application and indu&s;try. Indu&s;try is the law of our being; it is the demand of nature, of rea&s;on, and of God. Remember always, my young friend, that the years which now pa&s;s over your head, leave permanent memorials behind them.

<P>MR. Blanford, of whom I had occa|&s;ion to &s;peak before, was &s;o plea&s;ed with the country, that he re&s;olved on making a purcha&s;e when a fair opportunity &s;hould of|fer. To gain a &s;ettlement in the neighbor|hood of Mr. Worthy, was an object with him. When, therefore, he heard that Mr. Slack's farm was upon &s;ale, he went to take a view of it. He purcha&s;ed the place, and as &s;oon as he could put his affairs in order, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The arrival of &s;uch a neighbor, was no&s;mall acqui&s;ition to Mr. Worthy, and Mr. Blanford afterwards owned to his friends that, "had it not been for Mr. Worthy, he knew not how he &s;hould have carried on his fir&s;t attempts at farming." An acquaintance commenced between them,
<PB N="213" REF="025609_0211_0FCE11914A9653C0">
and their families, which grew into intimacy, and became the bond of permanent friend|&s;hip. This intimacy was u&s;eful to both, by affording each an opportunity to a&s;&s;i&s;t the other in tho&s;e things wherewith he was mo&s;t acquainted.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was not only acquainted with agriculture but with the &s;everal branches of the hu&s;bandry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho the word hu&s;bandry is commonly u&s;ed as if it were perfectly &s;ynonymous with agriculture, it is in &s;trict|ne&s;s, a word of larger &s;ignification. It includes not only the bu&s;ine&s;s of tillage, and the care and management of vegetables, but extends to the rearing of cattle, &s;wine, poultry, &amp;c. and indeed, to every branch of rural econo|my."&mdash;<HI>Dr. Deane.</HI></NOTE> art, which he had &s;tud|ied as a practical &s;cience. He was therefore able to afford Mr. Blanford the advice which he frequently needed in carrying on his bu&s;ine&s;s to the be&s;t advantage. The fami|lies al&s;o, be&s;ides the u&s;ual offices of neighbor|ing kindne&s;s, were mutually beneficial to each other. The young ladies who came from town being unacquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, were de|&s;irous of knowing &s;omething of it. While Mrs. Worthy's daughters could a&s;&s;i&s;t them in learning &s;ome of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary employ|ments, they were ready to lend the aid of their in&s;truction in &s;ome of the finer parts of nee|dle
<PB N="214" REF="025609_0212_0FCE11938B92FB70">
work, and in giving their dre&s;s a little more fa&s;hionable air, which was very plea&s;|ing to the young Mi&s;s Worthys. But this intercour&s;e between the&s;e two families, too convenient and agreeable on many accounts, was not without its inconveniencies. Mrs. Worthy, perceiving that the gayer dre&s;s of the Mi&s;s Blanfords made her daughters un|ea&s;y with their plain dre&s;s, permitted them to &s;end &s;ome cloth of their own make to procure the nece&s;&s;ary articles of female at|tire. She did not, however, gratify them as far as they wi&s;hed, but as far as &s;he thought proper. In this Mrs. Worthy di&s;|covered great prudence; for on the one hand, if &s;he had wholly denied them this fe|male gratification, they would have been mortified and di&s;couraged; and on the oth|er, an unlimited indulgence would have been a great di&s;advantage, as the things they made were much more u&s;eful and durable than tho&s;e they bought; and be&s;ides, it is more re&s;pectable for a farmer's family to be cloth|ed in their own manufacture than in that which comes from abroad. Mrs. Worthy reconciled the minds of her daughters by the&s;e arguments, and by reminding them that the young ladies, who&s;e appearance had excited their ambition, had been bred
<PB N="215" REF="025609_0213_0FCE11951BB110C8">
up in town, where fa&s;hionable dre&s;s was much more attended to, than in the rural &s;tate wherein they lived; and al&s;o that Mr. Blanford could afford it much better than they. Mrs. Worthy pointed out many poorer families, who&s;e dre&s;s was as much plainer than theirs, as theirs was plain|er than the Mi&s;s Blanfords; telling them at the &s;ame time, that all judicious peo|ple would look upon them the better for appearing according to their &s;tation and em|ployment, and for &s;uiting their dre&s;s to the place where they lived. The Mi&s;s Blan|fords were delighted with Mrs. Worthy. They were loud in her prai&s;es to their friends in the the town, on account of her agreeable manners as a country gentlewo|man, and al&s;o on account of the &s;erene and placid mind which &s;he always di&s;covered. They often added to the little dome&s;tic cir|cle that &s;urrounded Mrs. Worthy in the af|ternoon or on a plea&s;ant evening. It was on one of tho&s;e occa&s;ions, as &s;he was &s;ur|rounded by her daughters, and their young friends, when the placid beams of the ri&s;ing moon had &s;oothed all their feelings, and the di&s;tant ca&s;cade gently murmured on their ears, that Mrs. Worthy plea&s;antly in&s;tructed them by the following fable.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="025609_0214_0FCE1197593337B8">
"Labor, the offspring of Want and the mother of Health and Contentment, lived with her two daughters in a little cottage, by the &s;ide of a hill, at a great di&s;tance from town. They were totally unacquainted with the great, and had kept no better com|pany than the neighboring villagers; but having a de&s;ire to &s;ee the world, they for&s;ook their companions and their habitation, and determined to travel. Labor went &s;oberly along the road with Health on her right hand, who by the &s;prightline&s;s of her conver&s;ation and &s;ongs of cheerfulne&s;s and joy, &s;oftened the toils of the way, while Contentment went &s;miling on the left, &s;upporting the &s;teps of her mother, and by her perpetual good hu|mor encrea&s;ing the vivacity of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>"In this manner they travelled over for|e&s;ts, and through towns and villages, till at the la&s;t they arrived at the capital of the kingdom. At their entrance into the city, the mother conjured her daughters never to loo&s;e &s;ight of her; for it was the will of Jupiter, &s;he &s;aid, that their &s;eparation &s;hould be attended with the utter ruin of all three. But Health was of too gay a di&s;po&s;ition to regard the coun&s;els of Labor; &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be debauched by Intemperance, and at la&s;t died in child birth of Di&s;ea&s;e.
<PB N="217" REF="025609_0215_0FD0043E5FC1A768">
Contentment, in the ab&s;ence of her &s;i&s;ter, gave her&s;elf up to the enticement of Sloth, and was never heard of after; while Labor, who could have no enjoyment without her daughters, went every where in &s;earch of them, till &s;he was at la&s;t &s;eized by La&s;&s;itude in her way, and died in mi&s;ery."</P>
<P>The young ladies expre&s;&s;ed the gratifica|tion they felt from the amu&s;ing fable; and were delighted with the engaging manner in which Mrs. Worthy introduced it. It was by her gentlene&s;s and good advice, and by encouraging their indu&s;try with due ap|plau&s;e, &s;howing tho&s;e young ladies when there on a vi&s;it, her daughters nice work, that they gained the a&s;cendency of them|&s;elves &s;o far, as to be able to &s;ee their finery without an unea&s;y feeling, or even a wi&s;h to &s;acrifice intere&s;t and convenience for the &s;ake of obtaining it. The Mi&s;s Blanfords, on the other hand, began to be more and more de&s;irous to imitate, and if po&s;&s;ible to equal, tho&s;e &s;amples of indu&s;try and ingenu|ity which the Mi&s;s Worthys exhibited. As this di&s;po&s;ition encrea&s;ed, it was ob&s;erva|ble that their regard for gay dre&s;s le&s;&s;ened; and it was not long before they could give &s;ome good &s;pecimens of their improve|ment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. Mr. Worthy corrects &s;ome fal&s;e notions in his children.&mdash;Story of Mr. Lordly&mdash;and Mr. Blanford's de&s;cription of a venerable oak.</HEAD>
<P>A SIMILAR &s;pirit began to make its appearance among Mr. Worthy's &s;ons. Of this &s;pirit he endeavored to cure them by many u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons. As they were pa&s;&s;|ing a beautiful meadow that abounded with various flowers, which were plea&s;ing to the eye, he a&s;ked his little &s;ons if they did not think that a plea&s;ant place to work in. "O yes, &s;ay they, it is &s;o &s;mooth and beautiful, that it mu&s;t be ea&s;ier to work there than in our field, where it is rough and hard; and be&s;ides, how charming mu&s;t them flowers make it?"&mdash;"My children, replied Mr. Worthy, you do not con&s;ider that there are many poi&s;onous weeds lurking about under tho&s;e flowers, which would de&s;troy your health, and give you pain. Ju&s;t &s;o it is with many who are rich; their circum&s;tances look fair and plea&s;ant, and they &s;eem to live
<PB N="219" REF="025609_0217_0FD004414D2CF0A8">
at ea&s;e; but under this appearance often|times lurk many evil weeds which poi&s;on all their enjoyments. They often envy the contentment that poor people enjoy. So true it is, "that man's life does not con&s;i&s;t in the abundance which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth." He recommended to them, contentment in their condition; and never to de&s;pi&s;e the poor, or covet the rich man's condition, be|cau&s;e both are liable to temptations and in|felicities; and neither of them de&s;titute of enjoyments. This truth, he &s;aid, was fully proved in the &s;tory of Mr. Lordly, who was a rich, but envious man, and oppre&s;&s;ed his neighbor Penury to a very great degree. As they had now reached their own field, Mr. Worthy &s;aid that he would take an op|portunity &s;oon to rehear&s;e it to them.</P>
<P>When the &s;un began to &s;corch them by its heat, and their fatigue required them to retire to the &s;preading oak, where they went to &s;eek re&s;t in the cooling &s;hade, Mr. Wor|thy renewed the &s;ubject, and told his chil|dren and the other laborers that as a reward for their diligence and exertions, and to re|lieve them from their fatigue, he would re|late to them the &s;tory he had mentioned.&mdash;"In a di&s;tant part of the country, and not many years ago, there lived a rich man who
<PB N="220" REF="025609_0218_0FD00442D78C9080">
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the means of &s;atisfaction and enjoyment, that the world could give, without the power of enjoying any thing. His wealth made him haughty and in&s;olent, and indolence made him fretful and peevi&s;h. He was troubled with many pains which aro&s;e from the manner of his living, and which made him very impatient. I &s;hall conceal his real name, and call him Lordly. There was a poor man whom I &s;hall call Penury, who lived not far from him. Mr. Penury was a harmle&s;s inoffen&s;ive man, and went &s;inging, or whi&s;tling, by Mr. Lordly's, to his daily labor. The health and happi|ne&s;s this poor man appeared to enjoy, ex|cited the envy of Mr. Lordly, who deter|mined to de&s;troy the little means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence that his family enjoyed. They were, like him&s;elf, robu&s;t and healthy, having no means of luxury, and being obliged to labor. He accordingly ordered his people to let loo&s;e his great ma&s;tiff dog upon the only cow the poor man owned, and from which his family drew much of their nouri&s;hment. The dog cha&s;ed her into a quagmire, where &s;he died, and then turned and devoured the co&s;&s;et lamb that followed her where ever &s;he went. It was all the lamb the poor man owned." Little Jo&s;eph, who was all attention to &s;uch
<PB N="221" REF="025609_0219_0FCF4B0172B7F2A0">
&s;tories, could not contain him&s;elf any long|er. He exclaimed again&s;t that rich man, who could be &s;o cruel to Mr. Penury; and "wi&s;hed &s;omebody had killed that great ugly dog before he had killed that poor lit|tle lamb." When each one had made his ob&s;ervation on the ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;uch con|duct, Mr. Worthy continued the &s;tory.&mdash;</P>
<P>"It happened that a war with the we&s;t|ern &s;avages broke out about this time. Mr. Penury, who &s;uffered many other cru|elties from Mr. Lordly, was willing to ri&s;que any thing, rather than continue to live near &s;o unju&s;t and cruel a man. He enli&s;ted a|mong the troops rai&s;ed for the defence of the frontier &s;ettlements. Leaving the &s;mall bounty he received with his family for their &s;upport and comfort, he went forward and joined his company. It &s;o happened that in the fir&s;t attack of the enemy Mr. Penury was taken pri&s;oner and the troops were rout|ed. The news of this defeat alarmed Mr. Lordly, who began now to apprehend him|&s;elf in danger, for the enemy poured down toward that part of the country where he lived. He determined to &s;eek his &s;afety by flight. But by attempting this acro&s;s the country, he fell in the way of a party of bold warriors, who had ventured far down
<PB N="222" REF="025609_0220_0FD00447794B8E88">
into the country. They made him their pri&s;|oner, and carried him into their own coun|try, where the &s;avages had carried Mr. Pen|ury a little before.</P>
<P>"They were not treated with tho&s;e acts of cruelty which often take place in &s;uch ca&s;es; but were put immediately to do their drudgery. Lordly, who had lived an idle life, made a poor figure at this bu&s;ine&s;s, while Penury, who had been accu&s;tomed to labor and hard fare, did his duty well, and plea&s;ed his new ma&s;ters very much. He grew daily in their e&s;teem, and was obliged to help his more unfortunate fellow pri&s;oner, to &s;ave him from the many &s;everities with which they threatened him. They made him a kind of &s;ervant to the other, and obliged him to obey him. Penury treated his new &s;ervant with great lenity and kindne&s;s, during the whole time they were in this &s;ituation. At la&s;t they were redeemed. But Penury had &s;o ingratiated him&s;elf with them that it was with difficulty his relea&s;e could be obtained. Returning to their native country, Mr. Lordly was fully convinced of the inju&s;tice of his former conduct, and of the equity of divine providence in his captivity, and &s;uf|ferings. As a compen&s;ation for the injuries he had formerly done to Mr. Penury, and
<PB N="223" REF="025609_0221_0FD0044988A1DAA8">
as an acknowledgment of the noble &s;pirit he di&s;covered during their di&s;tre&s;sful cap|tivity, he offered to &s;upport him ever after in ea&s;e. To which Mr. Penury replied, that he had been bred up to hard labor and coar&s;e fare&mdash;that as to idlenene&s;s and riches he &s;hould not know what to do with them; he had been very happy and contented without them, and that he de&s;ired nothing more than to be placed in his former &s;ituation, in which, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God and a good con&s;cience, he could enjoy him&s;elf undi&s;|turbed. Mr. Lordly was &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o much genero&s;ity in &s;o poor a man. He could not help reflecting, that many a princely &s;oul might be found in cottages, and many a philo&s;opher following the plough. He was made much wi&s;er than he ever was before, and probably than ever he would have been, had he not have been made &s;o by misfortune. He &s;aw, and acknowledged, the hand of providence in all he had been called to pa&s;s through, and re&s;olved for the future on a life of piety and charity."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as Mr. Worthy had fini&s;hed the a|bove narrative, Mr. Blanford arrived at the &s;hady oak, where this little group of farm|ers were refre&s;hing them&s;elves, and pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of their tarry under it, in
<PB N="224" REF="025609_0222_0FD0044B00D31328">
conver&s;ation &s;uited to his new employment. Ob&s;erving their cheerfulne&s;s and alacrity, which was renewed by the manner in which they had been pa&s;&s;ing their time, he made &s;everal ingenious ob&s;ervations, in a letter to Mr. Belmont, on the phy&s;ical effects of reading and conver&s;ation on the animal &s;pi|rits, or the natural connection between amu&s;e|ment and improvement of the mind, and re|covery from bodily fatigue. In this letter he &s;aid many things highly applauding Mr. Worthy's manner of proceeding in this re|&s;pect, and ob&s;erved, that altho he accom|pli&s;hed a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s, yet that there was never any hurry about it, nor were any in his &s;ervice ever overdone with hard labor; and he could not account for it in any other way, than that of his taking &s;o much pains to renew their &s;pirits by tho&s;e &s;entimental amu&s;ements which drew their attention from labor, and ani|mated them, by in&s;piring them with a gen|erous emulation for good and worthy actions.</P>
<P>Among many other things, he gave Mr. Belmont the following de&s;cription of the venerable oak, under who&s;e cooling &s;hade he found them at the above amu&s;ing employ|ment.&mdash;This old and lofty oak, &s;ays he, an|&s;wers
<PB N="225" REF="025609_0223_0FD00450019810D8">
the de&s;cription we have of that huge tree, at Huntingfield, in Suffolk, called Queen Elizabeth's Oak. This is &s;aid to be "eleven yards in circumference, at the height of &s;even feet from the ground; and from the condition of other trees of the &s;ame &s;ort in different parts of the kingdom, who&s;e age has been a&s;certained pretty well from hi&s;torical circum&s;tances, this mu&s;t be ad|judged to be not le&s;s than five or &s;ix hundred years old." Though this oak, which gave &s;hade and &s;helter to Mr. Worthy, was not of &s;o princely a &s;ize, nor can I determine preci&s;ely its age; yet this oak, like Queen Elizabeth's tree, &s;till retained &s;ome degree of vigor, though many of its boughs were broken off, and tho&s;e which remained, were approaching to decay. The principal arm, now bald with dry antiquity, &s;hoots up to a lofty height, and being hollow, with &s;everal cracks re&s;embling loop holes, through which the light &s;hines in its cavity, it gives us an idea of the winding &s;tairca&s;e in a lofty goth|ic turret, which, detached from the other ruins of &s;ome venerable pile, hangs totter|ing to its fall, and affects the mind of a be|holder after the &s;ame manner, by its great|ne&s;s and &s;ublimity."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. The plea&s;ures and advantages of dome&s;tic intercour&s;e and cheerfulne&s;s&mdash;How to pre|vent the inconvenience of unavoidable inter|ruptions at &s;chool&mdash;Plea&s;ant in&s;truction from the &s;criptures, acquaintance with them recommended, danger of making light of them&mdash;Cautions to farmers in a thunder &s;torm.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tory being ended, and it being time to quit the &s;hade, they all went cheer|fully to their labor, which &s;eemed now to pa&s;s on lightly. They continued to labor and re&s;t alternately, until the &s;etting &s;un in|vited them to quit the field of labor for the peaceful abode of the beloved family, where they found Mrs. and the Mi&s;s Blanfords on a vi&s;it. When they had wa&s;hed and put on &s;uitable clothes, they were all introduced to the company of their new friends; and each expre&s;&s;ed, either by words or by the vivacity of their countenance, the plea&s;ure they felt on this occa&s;ion. The vi&s;itants
<PB N="228" REF="025609_0226_0FD00454EDA4FB78">
were equally plea&s;ed with the neatne&s;s of their appearance and the propriety of their manners, which were free from that rough|ne&s;s which many times is to be &s;een among laboring young men. There was a mildne&s;s and gentlene&s;s in their manners which made them appear very amiable, and recommend|ed them very much to Mrs. Blanford, who was high in their prai&s;es to her hu&s;band. As &s;he was a lady of excellent under&s;tand|ing and di&s;cernment, it was much in their favor to be &s;o well approved of by her. When the vi&s;itors were gone, Henry related the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tory they had been entertained with, to his &s;i&s;ters, which amu&s;ed them for the evening. This was a kind of intercour&s;e which Mr. and Mrs. Worthy always encouraged their family to maintain among them&s;elves. If one was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any thing entertaining and agreeable, it was communicated to the re&s;t. They did not live together as too many families do, without &s;eeming, to have any affection for one another, or having any agreeable &s;ociety together; but they conver&s;ed together, and were never more delighted than in their own dome&s;tic circle. This often occa&s;ioned a &s;ight that made the parental brea&s;t heave with joyful &s;en&s;ations, when they beheld
<PB N="229" REF="025609_0227_0FD004566683F470">
their family li&s;tening to the tale of woe, or to the rehear&s;al of a more plea&s;ing &s;cene, which one would exhibit while the re&s;t at|tended. At other times, the parent's heart is dilated with joy, while the playful tricks and innocent mirth of the children, relax their minds, and prepare them for more vig|orous application, or contribute to health and vivacity. The plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life may be greatly encrea&s;ed by the&s;e inno|cent amu&s;ements. This kind of intercour&s;e &s;erves to &s;often the rougher mind and man|ners, and to create a cement of affection, and a tender &s;ympathy that can expire but with life.</P>
<P>In order to remedy the inconvenience ari&s;ing from the frequent interruption of boys at &s;chool, which is unavoidable in a farmer's bu&s;ine&s;s, Mr. Worthy would always either find a little lei&s;ure to hear them read at home, or take a &s;mall book in his pocket, that they might do it while re&s;ting under the &s;hady oak. At other times, and as they were more advanced, he helped their recollection of the &s;criptures by inquiring concerning the char|acter of the patriarchs and good men, of whom they give an account, and what was the influence of their character on their out|ward condition. He amu&s;ed his children
<PB N="230" REF="025609_0228_0FD00457E6F8F978">
by de&s;cribing more particularly the dre&s;s and manners of tho&s;e people&mdash;telling them how they lived&mdash;"Not in &s;uch hou&s;es as we do, but in tents, and under the &s;hade of trees as we now are." He not only amu&s;ed them by a de&s;cription of the rural manner of their life, but in&s;tructed them by relating their tran&s;actions, how they conducted in particular circum&s;tances, their obedience to the commands of God, and how well they pro&s;pered when they obeyed, and how &s;e|verely they were puni&s;hed for their di&s;obe|dience when they were guilty of it. This made them well acquainted, and greatly plea&s;ed with the hi&s;torical part of the Old Te&s;tament; it afforded them amu&s;ement, while it conveyed u&s;eful &s;entiments to the heart. In the &s;ame way he recommended the New Te&s;tament, which they read with growing plea&s;ure, as their minds opened to comprehend more and more of its excellent doctrines, and to &s;ee new beauties in the life and character of our Lord, and of his Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>"I don't know, &s;aid Mr. Worthy to his &s;ons, as they were re&s;ting the next day, of any thing more favorable to a young man's character than his being fond of his bible. That contains a mo&s;t glorious plan of grace&mdash;
<PB N="231" REF="025609_0229_0FD0045C062F38B0">
the be&s;t rules for conducting, with the &s;tronge&s;t motives to virtue. When he be|gins to think and &s;peak lightly of that, it is an evidence that he is lo&s;ing his principles of moral action; and he is in danger of be|ing led a&s;tray by vicious and unprincipled people. Having let go his hold of this grand pillar, he is liable to fall. So long as he reads his bible, he will be likely to mind &s;omething of what it contains. If he does not read it, and di&s;regards what it &s;ays as an idle tale, he will be like a ve&s;&s;el that is driven from its fa&s;tening, and floats on a wide and boi&s;terous &s;ea. There is a connection, con|tinued Mr. Worthy, between attention to this and pro&s;perity in the world&mdash;at lea&s;t, comfort and happine&s;s in it. This is the good man's riche&s;t trea&s;ure, his greate&s;t delight. There is not a truer &s;aying to be found than that of the wi&s;e man&mdash;"He that walketh uprightly, walketh &s;urely."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. x. 9.</NOTE> It is the &s;ure&s;t way to &s;ucce&s;s in our affairs; and whether we be rich or poor, it is the &s;afe&s;t way. I knew a per&s;on, &s;aid he, and I doubt not but there are thou&s;ands be&s;ide, who always kept his bible by his bed &s;ide, when a young man, and after reading a chapter, would offer up prayers and prai&s;es
<PB N="232" REF="025609_0230_0FD0045DD7915728">
to God. This was his con&s;tant practice. He was obliged to labor all day. This was almo&s;t the only time he could find for read|ing. By a con&s;tant u&s;e of this opportunity, &s;hort as it was, he became well acquainted with the &s;criptures. He was kept out of bad company by the influence of this prac|tice. He had only his hands to begin the world with. He began it with virtue, with indu&s;try, and a reliance on divine provi|dence. He lived to bring up a large family of children well by the &s;trength of his own indu&s;try&mdash;was beloved and re&s;pected by all who knew him, and found by his own happy experience that "the ways of wi&s;dom were ways of plea&s;antne&s;s"&mdash;I would therefore recommend it to you, my dear children, to make the &s;ame experiment."</P>
<P>A &s;udden gu&s;t of wind, with the appear|ance of a cloud at the we&s;tward, indicating a &s;hower, induced them to go immediately to the field to fini&s;h what they were doing; but it was not long before the violence of the tempe&s;t drove them from it. Mr. Worthy called on all hands to fly to yonder cop&s;e of wood for &s;helter, which they accordingly did. This place afforded them but an im|perfect cover from the rain and hail, which came down like a torrent, accompanied
<PB N="233" REF="025609_0231_0FD0045F51EFC048">
with &s;harp lightning, and heavy thunder. They were very wet, and &s;ome of his people were much frightened, and began to com|plain that they were not under the great oak. But Mr. Worthy compo&s;ed them by &s;aying they were much more &s;ecure where they now were, e&s;pecially from the effects of the lightning. He told them of the many in&s;tances of per&s;ons being killed by repairing to tall trees for a cover from a thunder &s;how|er&mdash;that he was always aware of danger from them, but that he had never been &s;o fully convinced of it as he was now, &s;ince &s;o many per&s;ons had been killed that &s;ea&s;on by flying to a large tree in the open field for &s;helter. "When, &s;aid he, they are caught in a &s;hower, they e&s;cape from the open field to a large tree that &s;tands in the middle of it, hang up their &s;cythes, or other tools made of iron, and &s;it or &s;tand directly under the point. The tree, being alone and a taller object than any near it, takes the light|ning, the iron attracts it, and conveys it to the man, and he is in&s;tantly lifele&s;s, without knowing him&s;elf to be in danger. And be|&s;ides, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, I begin to fear le&s;t this high wind &s;hould blow down the old limb that towers &s;o high, though it &s;hould not be &s;truck by the lightning." They
<PB N="234" REF="025609_0232_0FD00460E91113A8">
&s;eemed &s;atisfied with what Mr. Worthy &s;aid on the &s;ubject; but, how much more rea&s;on had they to be thankful, when in going home after the &s;hower was over, they found the limb broken off, which, in its fall, had unfor|tunately killed one of the cows who had fled thither for &s;afety.&mdash;This, &s;aid Mr. Worthy, is purely providential&mdash;you &s;ee that God has given to man more knowledge than to the bea&s;ts of the field. Had we re|&s;orted hither for &s;afety, this might have been the lot of &s;ome of us. You &s;ee we are in the hands of a kind pre&s;erver, who directs our way for us." On their return home there was great mourning for the poor cow; but the con&s;ideration of their e&s;cape from the danger, was a matter of &s;o great con&s;o|lation that they &s;oon forgot their misfortune.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy's &s;entiments about avoiding the highe&s;t trees in an open field, were very ju&s;t, and de&s;erve the attention of his brother farmers; and particularly that of hanging up their &s;cythes, &amp;c. over their heads. This is found to be more dangerous in a flat open country, than in fore&s;ts and among hills. It is ob&s;ervable that mo&s;t of the accounts of per&s;ons killed by lightning in the country, are in the above &s;ituation, during the time of harve&s;t and mowing.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX. The feeling heart is touched, in this chapter, by the lively picture of fraternal affection, amid&s;t the changes of fortune, between four brothers, named A&s;ia, Africa, Europe and America.</HEAD>
<P>STORIES, founded on fact, or on circum&s;tances which might ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed to happen in real life, may be made very u&s;eful in families.

<P>"A reputable merchant, by the name of Weatherly, who lived in Nan&s;emond, had four &s;ons; being &s;omewhat &s;ingular in his turn, he named them A&s;ia, Africa, Europe and America.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is now living in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a family bearing the&s;e names.</NOTE> The&s;e four brothers were trained up by their mother during childhood with great care. They lived together in re|markable good humor and harmony, tho &s;omewhat different in their natural temper and di&s;po&s;ition. But, before they were either of them fit for bu&s;ine&s;s the elde&s;t died, to the great grief of their parents. He was a promi&s;ing youth, but, alas, ere the virtues of his mind ripened into fruit, he was cut off! The opening flower clo&s;ed up, it faded away and was &s;een no more!" Mrs. Wor|thy could never read this without a tear. It afforded her a kind of luxurious grief, which &s;he delighted once in a while to in|dulge, that &s;he might not loo&s;e the plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion of her beloved Charles. "The
<PB N="237" REF="025609_0235_0FD0046B29CAE9E0">
death of the elde&s;t &s;on made Mr. and Mrs. Weatherly more attentive than ever to furth|er the education and good morals of the others. In her early care of them, &s;he had &s;o balanced their oppo&s;ite defects as to pro|duce the utmo&s;t harmony and brotherly af|fection and conde&s;cen&s;ion. She accu&s;tom|ed them to treat their elders with re&s;pect. This had a good affect in preventing any childi&s;h conte&s;ts for the preference, as each knew, and was contented with his own rank; and always waited his proper turn. It al&s;o made them behave with good manners to &s;trangers, be their condition in life what it might. They were never known to treat a beggar with in&s;ult or abu&s;e, but were always di&s;po&s;ed to charity.</P>
<P>Mr. Weatherly, being a man of a literary turn, determined too give his &s;ons a learned education. It was not long after they were &s;ent to the univer&s;ity, that he met with &s;uch heavy lo&s;&s;es in his bu&s;ine&s;s that he was ob|liged to take the benefit of the bankrupt act. This made his &s;ituation &s;o di&s;agreea|ble that he determined on a voyage to A|merica to collect &s;ome debts for the &s;up|port of his family, which he promi&s;ed to re|mit as fa&s;t as he could collect them. His wife and children were incon&s;olable at his

leaving them; but how were their &s;orrows encrea&s;ed, when on the return of the &s;hip, they not only had no remittances, but heard nothing of him. They &s;oon had little left for enjoyment but brotherly love, which rather encrea&s;ed than abated; nor any thing to recommend them to notice and e&s;teem but their good conduct. In this they &s;uc|ceeded well. As they heard nothing from their father it became nece&s;&s;ary for them to quit the univer&s;ity, and &s;eek &s;ome employ|ment that would afford them a living. Af|rica had &s;o far improved him&s;elf at the univer&s;ity as to get recommended as a pri|vate tutor in a family, where he received a &s;alary more than &s;ufficient for him&s;elf. He now felt him&s;elf happy in being able to af|ford his mother &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Europe obtained a place with a merchant; with whom he continued the term agreed on, and being a faithful active youth the merchant took him into partner&s;hip at the expiration of his apprentice&s;hip. America, tho young, embraced the offer of Mr. Thornton, an old friend of his father, to take a voyage with him to &s;ea. As nothing better offered, he continued in that way until he was appointed mate of a &s;hip up the Baltic." "Where is the Baltic daddy, &s;aid one of the children,

as he was reading." "It is, &s;aid he, a great gulph or &s;ea in Europe, that lies between Ger|many and Poland on the &s;outh, and Sweden on the north; from which run &s;everal other gulphs. It is remarkable that this &s;ea nev|er ebbs nor &s;lows, and yet there is a current that &s;ets through the &s;ound into the ocean, and it is generally frozen over three or four months in the year." Notwith&s;tanding his youth, continued Mr. Worthy, the own|ers of the &s;hip determined to give him the command of one of their large &s;hips on the fir&s;t vacancy.</P>
<P>"They had not yet been able to obtain any intelligence concerning their father. The &s;ucce&s;s that had hitherto attended them, compen&s;ated in &s;ome mea&s;ure the great lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tained by his ab&s;ence. But the pat|ron of Africa, happening to die about this time, deprived him of the means of further &s;upport. A train of unfortunate circum|&s;tances embarra&s;&s;ed the affairs of Europe, and after &s;ometime they became de&s;parate. In the&s;e reduced circum&s;tances he was mor|tified to live among his old acquaintance, and fooli&s;hly retired to a remote part of the country to &s;eclude him&s;elf from &s;ociety. While he was in this retired &s;tate there came along a company of &s;trolling players.
<PB N="240" REF="025609_0238_0FCE85C3621A6478">
He was over per&s;uaded to join them and go about the country acting with them. Previ|ous to the&s;e misfortunes, America, who had made &s;everal voyages up the Baltic, was invit|ed home to a more profitable employment in the &s;ervice of his brother and company. Having been ab&s;ent &s;everal years without &s;eeing his brothers, he embraced the offer the more cheerfully, as it would give him an opportunity not only of &s;eeing but of being frequently with them, as he &s;uppo&s;ed. The con&s;ideration of this renewed all the feelings of his early days, and got the better of every other con&s;ideration. He imme|diately left his employers without knowing what had happened to his brother, or even reflecting on the po&s;&s;ibility of it, and arrived ju&s;t in &s;ea&s;on to be witne&s;s to his brother's misfortunes.&mdash;So tran&s;itory is every pro&s;|pect in life!</P>
<P>"Being all reduced to circum&s;tances alike precarious, they had nothing left to comfort them&s;elves, or one another, but their mutual affection and brotherly love, which remained unbroken by &s;eparation, or by misfortune, or by the death of their mother, which hap|pened during the progre&s;s of the&s;e events, and which was a great trial to them. But the &s;trength of their affection was &s;oon to be

put to a &s;evere trial another way. This trial brought forth &s;ome in&s;tances of gener|o&s;ity, which ought to be re&s;cued from the moth of time, and &s;hould be pre&s;erved as an example to others.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now go back and take a view of Mr. Weatherly, whom we la&s;t &s;aw taking leave of his family for America; but find|ing his pro&s;pects all fore clo&s;ed he deter|mined for the Ea&s;t Indies, where he hoped in a little time to retrieve his circum&s;tances. He al&s;o determined that his family &s;hould not hear any thing from him, till he was able to relieve them from that poverty, and all tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he knew his ab&s;ence mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned. In the cour&s;e of a num|ber of years, during which time his family &s;uppo&s;ed him to be dead, he effected his purpo&s;e; and was now returned to make them rejoice in a participation of the fruits of his long ab&s;ence. No &s;ooner did Mr. Weatherly reach his native &s;hore, than he had the un&s;peakable mortification of &s;eeing his elde&s;t &s;on in this di&s;graceful &s;ituation of &s;trolling comedian. Tho long ab&s;ent, yet he recogni&s;ed him by a certain mark in his forehead, which left no doubt of its be|ing his &s;on. Rage and de&s;pair &s;eized him, and &s;uddenly leaving the place, he ha&s;tened
<PB N="242" REF="025609_0240_0FCE86E29C849150">
to find his other children, for he had already been informed of the death of his wife.</P>
<P>He &s;oon found where Africa, his &s;econd &s;on was, who, like an affectionate child, flew to his father's arms, on hearing that he was &s;till alive, and had arrived in that part of the world. After relating &s;omething of his ad|ventures, and the &s;ucce&s;s that had accom|panied them, he lamented the unfortunate circum&s;tances, and as he thought, di&s;graceful conduct of his elde&s;t &s;on, and a&s;&s;ured Africa that his brother Europe &s;hould be cut off from enjoying any &s;hare in the wealth he had acquired; but that he &s;hould immediately di|vide a large proportion of it between him and his younger brother. On finding his father thus determined to di&s;inherit his elde&s;t broth|er, Africa was much affected, but re&s;pect|fully thanked his father for his intended goodne&s;s to him. He &s;aid many things by way of apology for Europe, and endeavored by every method in his power to abate his father's re&s;entment; and nobly added, that his affection to his brother was &s;uch, that he could not think of accepting any fortune in which his brother was not to be a &s;harer. Mr. Weatherly was no le&s;s vexed than a&s;|toni&s;hed at this reply, which carried &s;uch an air of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s as left no room to doubt of its being his fixed determination.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="025609_0241_0FCE86E41C5C1DD8">
The arrival of his younger brother at this juncture, was very fortunate. He had ju&s;t arrived from &s;ea, and hearing of the return of his long lo&s;t father, he flew to the place where he then was, and entered ju&s;t as his brother was re&s;pectfully taking leave of his father. The &s;cene was truly affecting; and Mr. Weatherly, after many expre&s;&s;ions of affection for &s;o fine a &s;on, as he was plea&s;|ed to &s;tile him, and after a great deal of con|ver&s;ation, a&s;&s;ured America, "that he &s;hould inherit all his earnings, for that his brother Europe had rendered him&s;elf unworthy any part of his fortune, by his indi&s;cretion, and his other brother by his weakne&s;s and folly." America, with all the plainne&s;s and genero&s;|ity of a &s;eaman, plumply refu&s;ed accepting a farthing of it unle&s;s his brothers were allow|ed to come in for &s;hares. He declared to his father that although his elder brother might have erred, yet that he had an hone&s;t heart and a generous di&s;po&s;ition; and that, under his circum&s;tances, men were liable to do tho&s;e things they would not ju&s;tify in a different &s;ituation. There was &s;omething &s;o noble and frank in the manner in which America addre&s;&s;ed his father, and at the &s;ame time he &s;poke &s;o feelingly, that it produced a favorable effect upon him. Mr. Weatherly
<PB N="244" REF="025609_0242_0FCE86E68698DBA8">
could no longer retain any re&s;entment again&s;t an unfortunate &s;on, but declared that the generous manner in which his two &s;ons, and e&s;pecially America, had behaved, evinced to him that they were worthy of his favor, and al&s;o that they looked upon their brother Europe as de&s;erving the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The generous America, flew to inform his brothers of the happy change in his fa|ther's temper. It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the joy that this information gave them; and the hone&s;t &s;eaman felt more than he could expre&s;s. Their arrival in a harmonious and brotherly &s;ort, at their father's lodgings, bani&s;hed every prejudice from his mind, and in&s;pired the parent's heart with lively joy; while tran&s;ports of plea&s;ure filled the late un|fortunate Europe. Every thing being now amicably &s;ettled to mutual &s;atisfaction, they continued to live together in pro&s;perity, and on terms of affection and amity, &s;trength|ened by their late misfortunes."</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI. A &s;now &s;torm&mdash;a poor man peri&s;hes in it&mdash;Mr. Worthy's conduct on the occa&s;ion&mdash;a pathetic di&s;cour&s;e on charity&mdash;a poem on compa&s;&s;ion and charity.</HEAD>
<P>THE following winter was remark|ably &s;evere, and proved fatal to &s;everal per|&s;ons, who ventured too far in their attempts to beat through violent &s;now &s;torms. Many people are too venture&s;ome in this way. It is the more dangerous, as the cold &s;oon le&s;|&s;ens tho&s;e powers of exertion which they at fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s, and their efforts to &s;ave them|&s;elves dimini&s;h as the nece&s;&s;ity for making them encrea&s;es; great care &s;hould therefore be had by tho&s;e who are expo&s;ed to be out at all &s;ea&s;ons. They are often admoni&s;hed by the fate of others. About chri&s;tmas, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy nine, a man belonging to the &s;tate of Rhode I&s;land, left Bo&s;ton after a violent &s;now &s;torm had come on; the &s;now was drift|ed, and the whole atmo&s;phere was &s;o filled with it, that he could not &s;ee his way.
<PB N="246" REF="025609_0244_0FCE86ED541E44C0">
After &s;truggling in vain again&s;t the violence of the tempe&s;t, and in vain attempting to beat through the drifts of &s;now that were every moment encrea&s;ing, he, together with all his cattle, peri&s;hed on Bo&s;ton neck, and the next morning were found &s;tanding in a great &s;now bank, nearly covered up. This alarm|ing in&s;tance, near &s;o large a town, &s;hould make tho&s;e very cautious who live in a more thinly &s;ettled country. People may be induced to run great ri&s;ques in order to &s;ave expen|&s;es, but they &s;hould con&s;ider how dearly they may pay for the experiment, either by freezing partially, and &s;o being maimed, or by peri&s;hing. The fir&s;t alarming &s;ymptoms are a la&s;citude or indi&s;po&s;ition to action, and a drow&s;ine&s;s which inclines per&s;ons in this &s;ituation to lay down under a fence or any place of defence again&s;t the wind or &s;torm.&mdash;Here they in&s;en&s;ibly doze away into the &s;leep of death! Whenever any one is una|voidably reduced to this alarming &s;ituation, he &s;hould keep him&s;elf in motion, though he make no way ahead. The fir&s;t approach of &s;leepine&s;s &s;hould alarm, him with apprehen|&s;ions of death, which mu&s;t inevitably follow if he gives way in the lea&s;t to it. In&s;tead of doing this, he &s;hould walk back and forth in a little parade which he may make, even

if the &s;now is deep, often beating his hands, and otherwi&s;e exerting him&s;elf in different motions.</P>
<P>This being the fir&s;t winter after Mr. Blanford removed into the country, it ap|peared terrible to him; but he endeavored to make it as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible by often vi&s;iting at Mr. Worthy's. He happened to be caught there in a &s;torm of &s;now, again&s;t the violence of which he returned home with great difficulty. The next morning he was called upon, among others, to the relief of a family who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es he de&s;cribes in a pathetic manner in a letter to a friend:&mdash;"Hard by a cop&s;e of wood, and under the covert of a raggid cliff, &s;tood the hut of an indu&s;trious pea&s;ant, who&s;e early misfortunes, and numerous family, entailed poverty upon him. This poor man, taking his elde&s;t &s;on with him, went &s;ome di&s;tance into the woods in que&s;t of prey, to &s;upply the wants of a needy family, while another lad was di&s;|patched to procure a little meal to make a cake. This luckle&s;s man wandered far from his lonely cottage before he could obtain any game. There was already &s;ome &s;now on the ground, which, with the encrea&s;ing &s;torm that came on heavily towards night, made it impo&s;&s;ible to follow his track back again.
<PB N="248" REF="025609_0246_0FCE86F0DD8098D8">
The cold, which encrea&s;ed with the &s;torm, benumbed them &s;o as to make their motions languid. They wandered about this way and the other, endeavoring to face the &s;torm, as that gave them &s;ome direction towards home, till the darkne&s;s of the night prevented their being able any longer to keep any par|ticular cour&s;e. They endeavored to beat again&s;t it without knowing which way they went, or being able to make much way ahead. Here they wallowed about half buried in the &s;now banks, exerting their weary and enfeebled limbs, to reach the wi&s;hed for home, while the anxious wife prepares the be&s;t re|pa&s;t the humble roof afforded, to warm and refre&s;h them at their return. But, alas, how vain is all her care! While &s;he is thus em|ployed for their comfort, the blood chills and grows &s;tagnant in their veins! The darkne&s;s of the night brings on gloomy apprehen|&s;ions le&s;t &s;ome evil may have befallen her hu&s;band and her &s;on. As the evening ad|vances, her di&s;tre&s;s ri&s;es to half di&s;traction. The little ones hang about her, and, crying, a&s;k a father's return&mdash;"Why don't Daddy come&mdash;where is Dickie gone?"&mdash;Often does &s;he fly to the rattling wicket to receive him welcome&mdash;as often is &s;he deceived by the trembling of the door, before the violence of the &s;torm.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="025609_0247_0FCE86F75D208718">
In this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation does &s;he pa&s;s the night. The howling tempe&s;t without, and the more violent agitation within, formed a &s;cene that baffles all de&s;cription. In the morning, the &s;torm being over, &s;he &s;ent in|formation to the neare&s;t hou&s;e, that her hu&s;|band and &s;on were mi&s;&s;ing. Many people were &s;oon out &s;couring the woods. They &s;earched every place that &s;eemed probable, and at la&s;t they found the &s;on apparently ju&s;t expiring on the &s;tiffened corps of the father. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to attempt a de&s;cription of the poor woman's di&s;tre&s;s on this occa&s;ion; it was &s;uch as imagination may figure to it|&s;elf, as the natural effect of &s;o dreadful a ca|ta&s;trophe! A circum&s;tance that relieved her in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from the fir&s;t &s;hock, was, that her &s;on, who was in the dozing &s;tate already mentioned as a prelude to death, &s;oon revived, on proper applications, &s;o as to give hope of his recovery. It was on this occa&s;ion that my friend Worthy di&s;covered a genero&s;ity, and delicacy of mind, that indi|cates true greatne&s;s of &s;oul, and convinces me that not only many a philo&s;opher, but many a divine, and many a &s;aint, follows the plough. He addre&s;&s;ed the widow in lan|guage of tenderne&s;s and &s;ympathy; and a&s;|&s;ured her that &s;he might make her&s;elf ea&s;y
<PB N="250" REF="025609_0248_0FCE86FA58EC95B0">
with regard to a pre&s;ent &s;upply for her fa|mily; and that he would cau&s;e her &s;on to be tran&s;ported to his own hou&s;e, where every thing &s;hould be done to effect a total re&s;to|ration of the injured parts. The funeral of the unhappy victim, which was made at com|mon expen&s;e, principally by Mr. Worthy's influence, was attended with great &s;olemnity. A &s;ermon was given on the occa&s;ion by Mr. Villars. It was &s;hort, but pertinent and pa|thetic. It was on this occa&s;ion, that this wor|thy and truly pious clergyman, di&s;played with great force of language and warmth of expre&s;&s;ion, the vanity of the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and its liablene&s;s to di&s;appoint all our hopes and expectations; the frailty of man, and the numberle&s;s accidents to which he is here ex|po&s;ed. From a con&s;ideration of the vanity and tran&s;itory nature of all &s;ublunary things, he urged the importance of &s;ecuring an in|tere&s;t in a better &s;tate, and dwelt on the con|&s;olation that the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a &s;tate af|fords to mourners. On this part of the &s;ub|ject he could dwell with propriety, for the poor man who had fallen before the piercing cold, though very poor, had a regard for re|ligion, and whenever he could, he went to public wor&s;hip, though at the di&s;tance of &s;everal miles. This rendered him happier
<PB N="251" REF="025609_0249_0FCE86FC3B570E28">
while he lived, and rendered him fitter for the &s;udden death that had overtaken him.</P>
<P>Mr. Villars al&s;o took occa&s;ion to explain and recommend charity to the poor, and re|lief to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, as a great chri&s;tian duty, without which all preten&s;ions to religion were vain and fooli&s;h. "Men, &s;aid he, may appear to be devout, and may talk religi|ou&s;ly without expen&s;e; but the calls of charity bring them to the te&s;t, and will pre|&s;ently decide the que&s;tion, whether God or the world, duty or intere&s;t, preponderates." Mr. Villars was accu&s;tomed to view the mi&s;|eries of his fellow creatures with great ten|derne&s;s and humanity, and to relieve the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e who fell within his reach, as far as his own means would allow. He could therefore with good grace recommend to his hearers to "diffu&s;e a gleam of cheer|fulne&s;s over the &s;ufferings of the &s;olitary widow, and the needy fatherle&s;s, and to al|leviate their di&s;tre&s;sful condition, by &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as they could &s;pare. How hard, &s;aid he, is the lot of the poor? How pitiable the &s;tate of our fellow creatures, when de&s;|titute of every circum&s;tance that can allevi|ate, that can mitigate the &s;evere pangs of affliction, and afford common nece&s;&s;aries to the calls of a &s;urrounding, dependent family?
<PB N="252" REF="025609_0250_0FCE87029E4E3590">
How indi&s;pen&s;ible then is the obligation to exert our&s;elves in a&s;&s;i&s;ting our fellow crea|tures to render life at lea&s;t &s;upportable?" This pathetic addre&s;s had a good effect on the humane, if not on the moral feelings of the audience. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family re|ceived great relief, and places were provided for &s;everal of the children. Mrs. Worthy took one of tho&s;e children to bring up, and highly applauded the cheerfulne&s;s of her children, particularly of her daughters, in parting with &s;ome articles of their own clothing for the poor girls who were depriv|ed of their father.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. Mr. Worthy's ideas of economy&mdash;maxims concerning it&mdash;recommended and exemplifi|ed by Dr. Franklin&mdash;Fable of Avarice and Liberality.</HEAD>
<P>"LET nothing be lo&s;t," was a mot|to and con&s;tant injunction with Mr. Wor|thy. "It is is an old &s;aying, that a penny &s;aved, is as good as a penny earned." "I will venture to affirm, Mr. Worthy would &s;ay, it is better; for the &s;ame economy that teaches how to &s;ave a penny, will teach us al&s;o to make the be&s;t, and mo&s;t advantage|ous u&s;e of it." This &s;aving the effects of in|du&s;try from the devouring jaws of carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s and &s;quandering, does not imply the lea&s;t degree of par&s;imony or &s;tingine&s;s; but the mo&s;t prudent u&s;e and application of what we have acquired. "In mo&s;t of our hou&s;es, &s;aid Mr. Worthy to Mr. Blanford, when both their families were pre&s;ent, there is e|nough lo&s;t, and thrown away, of &s;ome one article, which if it were &s;aved with care, might purcha&s;e &s;ome other u&s;eful article for
<PB N="255" REF="025609_0253_0FCE8708A19CC068">
the family. I will in&s;tance, &s;aid he, in that of paper. I have no doubt but every fami|ly might &s;upply it&s;elf with paper every year for nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es, from the rags which are &s;wept out of doors and lo&s;t, or thrown into the fire and burnt." Here one of the Mi&s;s Blanfords blu&s;hed like crim&s;on, for &s;he had ju&s;t thrown a handful of linen &s;hreds into the fire. Mr. Worthy ob&s;erv|ing the blu&s;h, relieved her, and diverted them all with the &s;tory of Dr. Franklin's whi&s;tle.&mdash;"I recollect, &s;aid he, the &s;tory of Dr. Franklin, who when he was a &s;mall boy, had his pockets filled with coppers on a holiday. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this trea&s;ure, he &s;al|lied forth to a toy &s;hop to part with his cop|pers and plea&s;e his fancy. Being charmed with the &s;ound of a whi&s;tle, in the hands of a boy he met on the way, he voluntarily offered all his money for one. Returning home, he went whi&s;tling about hou&s;e, to the great annoyance of all the family, who under|&s;tanding the bargain, told him he had given four times as much for it as it was worth. This put him in mind of what good things he might have bought with the money he had lo&s;t. They laughed at him &s;o much that he cried for vexation; and the reflec|tion on what he had needle&s;sly lo&s;t, gave
<PB N="256" REF="025609_0254_0FCE870CDEFCEC20">
him more pain than the whi&s;tle gave him plea&s;ure. This want of economy, how|ever, was of great u&s;e to him afterwards, for when he was tempted to buy &s;ome un|nece&s;&s;ary thing, he would &s;ay to him&s;elf "Dont give too much for the whi&s;tle," and &s;o he &s;aved his money; and when he came on the &s;tage and ob&s;erved the conduct of others, he &s;aw many giving too much for their whi&s;tles. When, on the other hand, he &s;aw a man giving up every kind of com|fortable living, all the plea&s;ure of doing good to others, all the e&s;teem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of friend&s;hip, for the &s;ake of accumulating wealth; or, on the oth|er, &s;acrificing health, fortune, and whatever is valuable in life, to plea&s;ure, he would &s;ay, "Such men pay too dear for their whi&s;tles." The &s;tory amu&s;ed the company, and reliev|ed Mi&s;s Blanford from the confu&s;ion of mind into which the incident had thrown her; but it afforded a very in&s;tructive le&s;&s;on ever afterwards.</P>
<P>Mr. Blanford replied, "that he con&s;ider|ed economy as holding a middle rank be|tween avarice and prodigality; and that though it had no great brilliancy, and is by many con&s;idered as a tame indifferent quality,
<PB N="257" REF="025609_0255_0FCE870F89D05C10">
yet that it is the way to wealth, and has em|ployed the pens of &s;ome of the able&s;t writers. Dr. Franklin, who&s;e name will long live an honor to his country, employed many of his hours, even when occupied with national politics, in &s;tudying maxims of prudence and economy. Tho&s;e &s;ubjects indeed occupy a large proportion of his mi&s;|cellaneous writings. They are on that ac|count of un&s;peakably greater advantage to the world than if he had always &s;oared in the higher regions of &s;cience. Writings which are on a level with the public mind, are mo&s;t exten&s;ively u&s;eful. He therefore, who advances the mo&s;t maxims and be&s;t &s;uited to the exigencies of &s;ociety, does the mo&s;t benefit with his pen. Cer|tain it is, continued Mr. Blanford, that great part of the mi&s;eries of mankind are brought upon them&s;elves by the fal&s;e e&s;ti|mate they have made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whi&s;tles."</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy was as careful to &s;ave by economy as to acquire by indu&s;try. This gave him a great advantage over many who in their hurry about &s;omethings forget many others, and &s;o bring little to pa&s;s. They may be indu&s;trious in gathering, but
<PB N="258" REF="025609_0256_0FCE87105EA5A078">
kick over with their feet what their hands have gathered; while they are doing one thing, they undo another, and in their hurry bring nothing to pa&s;s. They run here and there, do a little of one thing, and a little of another, keep them&s;elves in a fret, their hou&s;e in a tumult, and at la&s;t leave every thing at &s;ixes and &s;evens. Mr. Worthy often &s;aid of &s;uch people, that they "let out at the &s;pile what they put in at the bung." He was never idle, and &s;eldom in a hurry. His bu&s;ine&s;s was well planned, and deliberate|ly executed. He laid out no more than could be fini&s;hed in &s;ea&s;on; never de&s;troy|ed what he had done by eagerne&s;s to do more than could be effected. He attended minutely to his affairs, and when the day clo&s;ed he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his cares with it. What|ever happened, he was &s;erene and temper|ate. He was thankful for pro&s;perity; but never di&s;compo&s;ed by cro&s;s accidents, be|cau&s;e he had taken proper care to guard again&s;t them. He never &s;uffered him&s;elf to be out of humor for what could not be prevented, nor anxious about events that were beyond the reach of human control. He was &s;ucce&s;sful in his bu&s;ine&s;s becau&s;e he ob&s;erved method, and by his economy he
<PB N="259" REF="025609_0257_0FCE8711D8074E60">
&s;aved an ample portion for the poor, who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing, every day came upon him.</P>
<P>The following fable confirms Mr. Blan|ford's definition of economy, and &s;hows it to &s;tand on a middle line between &s;olicitude and profu&s;ene&s;s. "In old time, when &s;ome grew rich and heaped up great &s;tores, while others &s;quandered away what they had got|ten, there lived by the &s;ide of a great field one of tho&s;e beings who never think of any thing but hoarding up great &s;tores of goods, and of having their coffers filled with gold. His name was <HI>Avarice.</HI> He owned all that va&s;t field which de&s;cended quite to the river on the &s;outh and extended to the mountain|ous country to the we&s;t. His granaries merely groaned under the oppre&s;&s;ion of his va&s;t crops. He better knew how to collect than to improve. <HI>Care</HI> &s;eized his brea&s;t, and deprived him of the happine&s;s he might otherwi&s;e have enjoyed.</P>
<P>Not far from him, on the &s;ummit of a beautiful ri&s;e, lived a maiden of uncommon beauty, in the bloom of youth. Her name was <HI>Liberality.</HI> Mild and gentle in her di&s;|po&s;ition, &s;he was ea&s;ily wrought upon by the appearance of want or di&s;tre&s;s in others. Her hou&s;e was the &s;eat of ho&s;pitality. Hither re&s;orted people of all cla&s;&s;es. Here
<PB N="260" REF="025609_0258_0FCE8713DD6FACD0">
the weary pilgrim would be &s;ure to find &s;helter and re&s;t. Her doors were open to all who were pa&s;&s;ing, and the be&s;t the hou&s;e afforded was brought forth and &s;et before them. She profu&s;ely &s;cattered the ble&s;&s;ings of her hand, and multitudes felt the effect of her genero&s;ity. But the extent of her fortune, though very great, was not equal to the extent of her genero&s;ity. Sad experience taught her that the objects of charity and of ho&s;pitality &s;hould not be univer&s;al, but &s;elected with care; for that in&s;tead of entertaining angels by an indi&s;|criminate reception of all, &s;he might &s;ome|times entertain harpies, and oftentimes give to the unde&s;erving. This di&s;covery was made too late to recover her circum|&s;tances. Her fortune was gone, and with that her friends. As &s;he &s;at one day reflect|ing on her&s;elf for the incautious manner in which &s;he had parted with her intere&s;t, Avarice called to upbraid her for the folly of which &s;he had been guilty. But when he entered the room where &s;he was &s;etting alone and &s;olitary, he was &s;truck with the beauty of her form, the gracefulne&s;s of her mein, and the placid amiablene&s;s of mind &s;hining in her countenance. In&s;tead of blaming, he propo&s;ed marriage to her, a&s;|&s;uring
<PB N="261" REF="025609_0259_0FCE8719E3CF2510">
her that he had more than he knew what to do with, and could not enjoy it alone. She mode&s;tly con&s;ented, on con|dition of his allowing her a certain pro|portion of it to be at her own di&s;po&s;|al. The conditions &s;ettled, the nuptials were celebrated with joy and fe&s;tivity; and they go on joyfully together. Avarice be|gan to ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of genero&s;ity; and Liberality to learn &s;ome of the caution of Avarice. The con&s;equence of this marriage was the birth of a beautiful little daughter in due time. It was, as the poet &s;ays,</P>
<LG>
<L>"A little maid of matchle&s;s worth.</L>
<L>Her face was mix'd of care and glee,</L>
<L>They chri&s;tened her ECONOMY!</L>
<L>And &s;til'd her fair di&s;cretion's queen,</L>
<L>The mi&s;tre&s;s of the golden mean.</L>

<L>Now LIBERALITY confin'd,</L>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII. This chapter concludes the hi&s;tory of Mr. Worthy.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Mr. Worthy followed his own maxims of economy, yet he never denied him&s;elf any of the nece&s;&s;aries, nor even the decent conveniences of life, that were within the compa&s;s of his means; and while he taught his &s;ons the maxims of fru|gality and prudence, which regulated his own conduct, his wife in&s;tructed her daugh|ters in the &s;ame art of making the mo&s;t of every thing. The knowledge of this art be|came the more nece&s;&s;ary for them, as they were now advancing towards that &s;tate wherein they would have occa&s;ion every day to practice it for them&s;elves. There is no one quality that unites &s;o many u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary properties in the female character as this. It was on account of Mrs. Wor|thy's elde&s;t daughter po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this knowl|edge to a high degree, that Mr. and Mrs. Blanford highly e&s;teemed her. Previous to their removing to the farm where they now
<PB N="263" REF="025609_0261_0FCE871D912B37C8">
re&s;ided, their &s;on George had conceived a &s;trong inclination for a &s;eafaring life. He was ab&s;ent at the time of their removal, and continued ab&s;ent for &s;ome time afterwards. He was attended by a variety of fortunes, having been &s;everal times ca&s;t away; and though more fortunate at others, yet he &s;uf|fered &s;o much that on his return, he was glad to quit the &s;eas, and retire with his father on the farm. He &s;oon became remarkably contented and &s;atisfied with his &s;ituation, con&s;idering he had been &s;o much abroad. He began to enter into all the plea&s;ures of their little circle of friends. Though their &s;ituation was rural, and their enjoyments of a nature &s;uited to the country, he partook of them with encrea&s;ing cheerfulne&s;s and de|light. He &s;carcely knew the cau&s;e of his growing attachment to a &s;cene, &s;o different from any thing to which he had been accu&s;|tomed, till he &s;ound his affections fixed on Mr. Worthy's elde&s;t daughter. He was enam|ored with her, not merely on account of the beauty of her per&s;on, though that was plea&s;|ing, but on account of the amiablene&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, the &s;prightline&s;s and vivacity of her mind, and the excellent manner in which &s;he had been educated. The affair was communicated to her parents, and their
<PB N="264" REF="025609_0262_0FCE8720C51DDC38">
permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it Mi&s;s Worthy was a&s;ked. There appeared no other objection to the young gentleman's propo&s;al, than that his education had been &s;o different from her's. Mr. Worthy feared that his habits in the fir&s;t part of life would be injurious to him in the country, and as a farmer. This difficulty, however, was le&s;&s;ening every day, by his en|crea&s;ing love of a country life. The affec|tion was mutual between young Mr. Blan|ford and Mi&s;s Dorcas Worthy, and the con|&s;ent of their parents was obtained. But pre|vious to their being married, he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of making a voyage to the We&s;t Indies to collect &s;ome debts, which he had left in bad hands, who had &s;everal times de|ceived him about payment. He &s;et &s;ail for Martinico, where he completed his bu&s;ine&s;s, after a detention of &s;everal months, and a great deal of perplexity, and embarked for home in the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el bound to his native town. Several other pa&s;&s;engers were on board the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, among whom were an Engli&s;h lady and her only daughter, a young lady of very elegant accompli&s;hments. The agreeable company on board the ve&s;&s;el, and the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of being &s;oon re&s;tored to his beloved Dorcas, together with a fine wind, lightened his &s;pirits, and made the
<PB N="265" REF="025609_0263_0FCE8722EF121450">
time he had been ab&s;ent, appear now but very &s;hort. They had nearly gained their pa&s;|&s;age, when there came on a violent &s;torm, which continued for &s;ome time. They were driven back again many leagues, and at la&s;t, by the violence of the wind, they were over|&s;et. It was on this occa&s;ion that young Mr. Blanford di&s;covered great fortitude and genero&s;ity. In the confu&s;ion of affairs, when each one &s;eemed ab&s;orbed in the care of him&s;elf, the two ladies and their waiting wo|man were left below in the cabin, from whence Mr. Blanford made an attempt, at the ri&s;que of his own life, to re&s;cue them. In this attempt he was &s;o happy as to be &s;ucce&s;sful, though Mrs. Farley, the mother of the young lady, was con&s;iderably injured in being pulled out of the cabin. They all remained on the &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el for &s;everal hours, to&s;&s;ed about by the boi&s;terous waves. At length the ma&s;ts gave way, and the deck being cleared of all incumbrances, the ve&s;&s;el righted up. They were now a mere wreck, floating about at the mercy of the wind and waves. In this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation, they continued more than fifty hours, when they di&s;covered a &s;hip to which they made &s;igns of di&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e being at length di&s;cover|ed by the people on board the &s;hip, the
<PB N="266" REF="025609_0264_0FCE872561855068">
Captain, who was a humane man, ran directly down for them, and took them all on board his own &s;hip, with every thing he could get from the wreck. Mr. Blanford was &s;o fortunate as to &s;ave his che&s;t, which contain|ed the principal part of the intere&s;t he had on board. The &s;hip was bound to Halifax, where they all arrived &s;afe in about twelve days. Young Mr. Blanford having been gone much longer than his friends expected, and hearing nothing of him, they grew ex|tremely unea&s;y about him. Mr. Blanford, who knew better about the nature of the bu|&s;ine&s;s he went upon than the re&s;t of the friends, was le&s;s unea&s;y about his &s;on. But a letter from a friend, informing that his &s;on had &s;ailed from the We&s;t Indies &s;ome time &s;ince, gave him great alarm. He &s;et out im|mediately for&mdash;, where he made every inquiry after intelligence about his &s;on, but could gain no more than that he had &s;ailed a number of weeks before, but had been heard nothing of &s;ince. In the&s;e di&s;tre&s;sful cir|cum&s;tances, with a heart ready to bur&s;t with grief, Mr. Blanford was about returning home with the melancholy probability that his &s;on was buried in a watery grave. In the morning, when he was going out of town, he met an old acquaintance who informed
<PB N="267" REF="025609_0265_0FCE8726E7F6F118">
him that a ve&s;&s;el had ju&s;t arrived from Ha|lifax with &s;ome pa&s;&s;engers on board, who, as he was informed, had been taken from a wreck at &s;ea. Mr. Blanford went immedi|ately to make inquiry, when to his joy and &s;urpri&s;e, the fir&s;t per&s;on he met coming from the &s;hip, was his lo&s;t &s;on. I need not attempt to de&s;cribe the mutual happine&s;s of this meeting, nor the tide of joy which aro&s;e in the family on their arrival home, after &s;ixteen months ab&s;ence. During this long ab&s;ence, and the fears that agitated her mind with regard to his &s;afety, Mi&s;s Worthy behaved with a mode&s;ty becoming her &s;ex; but was not able wholly to conceal the agitation of her mind. His unexpected arrival at a time when the apprehen&s;ions of his being lo&s;t were mo&s;t lively, was an incident too mighty for her. Immediately on his arrival at his father's, he flew to relieve her of tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions.&mdash;It was too much for her&mdash;the tide ro&s;e too high&mdash;&s;he fainted at the &s;ight of &s;o unexpected a vi&s;itant, but was &s;oon recovered. Tho&s;e incidents of fortune which had tried the &s;incerity of their mutual affections, &s;erved but to &s;trengthen their attachment to each other; and on the next new year's eve, their nuptials were celebrated in pre&s;ence of a number of their friends, who
<PB N="268" REF="025609_0266_0FCE872BED9A83C8">
gave every te&s;timony of their mutual joy and &s;ati&s;faction.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Worthy, who&s;e chief hap|pine&s;s it had been to &s;ee their children tak|ing to good cour&s;es, rewarding all their care by behaving well, and making them&s;elves e&s;teemed and beloved, now enjoyed the fruit of all their care and attention in &s;eeing them forming good connexions, and being able to acquit them&s;elves therein with honor and advantage. Young Mr. Blanford, &s;et|ting out in life with the advantage of a &s;mall farm given him by his father, and the &s;till greater advantage of a wife, who was perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of the bu&s;ine&s;s of her department, &s;oon began to flouri&s;h as a farmer, and in proce&s;s of time, became a wealthy farmer, and a re&s;pectable citizen. This connexion rendered the intercour&s;e between the two families, more frequent and agreeable. It was not interrupted by tho&s;e jealou&s;ies and competitions which &s;ometimes ari&s;e between neighbors, and which excite envyings, &s;trife and contentions. Their evenings, which were frequently &s;pent together, were never contaminated by foul breath of &s;candal and evil &s;peaking of others, as is too com|monly the ca&s;e; but in u&s;eful and plea&s;ant conver&s;ation&mdash;in ob&s;ervations on the gradual
<PB N="269" REF="025609_0267_0FCE872D9F066DB8">
progre&s;s of their &s;ettlements, and the ad|vances of agriculture&mdash;how the howling &s;wamp was converted into a plea&s;ing and u&s;e|ful meadow, and the rough ridge into a fine fruitful field. While the jocund di&s;cour&s;e goes round, the young people participate in the plea&s;ure which their parents &s;eem to en|joy in recounting their toils, and the &s;ucce&s;s attending them; and in turn, indulge them|&s;elves in youthful mirth. Mrs. Worthy would mix with them in their amu&s;ing &s;cenes in &s;o graceful a manner, that &s;he &s;eemed to be on a footing with them, and even to give life to their amu&s;ements, without letting down her dignity, or lo&s;ing a proper in|fluence over their minds, &s;o as to re&s;train them from every exce&s;s.</P>
<P>This intimacy between the families was productive of another effect, which was lit|tle thought of at fir&s;t, as the parties were quite young; but it was not long concealed from their parents, that Mr. Worthy's elde&s;t &s;on, Henry Smith, was &s;trongly attached to Mi&s;s Theodo&s;ia Blanford. Their youthful hearts were united by a bond too &s;trong to be broken, and their marriage was celebrat|ed a few months after the birth of a &s;econd child, to young Mr. Blanford. This being a &s;on, it was the occa&s;ion of great joy to all their friends.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="025609_0268_0FCE872F169203E0">
Mr. Worthy, who now &s;aw his children &s;ettling about him, conceived it proper to make a will, that no difficulty might ari&s;e to alienate the affections of his children from each other after his decea&s;e. In his will he made an equal di&s;tribution of his intere&s;t among all his children, and charged each one with whatever he gave them at their &s;ettle|ment. Thus, "&s;etting his hou&s;e in order, as he often expre&s;&s;ed it, that he might be &s;o far ready to receive his ma&s;ter's call." Mr. Worthy was much employed in offices in the town, wherein he acquitted him&s;elf much to his honor and their benefit; for he was truly a benevolent man and &s;tudied the good of others. He mode&s;tly declined all public employment, and public offices.
