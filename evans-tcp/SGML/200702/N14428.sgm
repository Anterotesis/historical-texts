<HEAD>A Narrative, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;avages who occa&s;ioned the following &s;cenes, were &s;ent from the Briti&s;h garri&s;on at Niagara, &s;ome time in the fore part of March, A. D. 1780, through a deep &s;now, on a wretched &s;kulking indian expedition, again&s;t a few &s;catter|ing people which they hoped to find about Su&s;|quehannah; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were making &s;ugar in the woods at that time of the year.</P>
<P>The number of indians which &s;kulked about We&s;tmorland at this time, was &s;ixteen: whether they all come from Niagara in company and &s;e|parated in the vicinity, or were &s;eparate parties from Niagara, I could never learn: but they ap|peared about We&s;tmorland in two parties of &s;ix and ten indians in different parts of the country; the party of ten appeared the next day after the party of &s;ix.</P>
<P>I will give a narrative of each in their turns.</P>
<P>The party of ten indians, after lurking about the &s;ettlement for &s;ome time, fir&s;t made their ap|pearance on Tue&s;day the 28th of March, at break of day, five miles below Plymouth &s;ettlement, where &s;undry people were &s;cattered about making maple &s;ugar, which is known to be a profitable branch of bu&s;ine&s;s here as in many parts of Ameri|ca: the manufacturers frequently build a litle
<PB N="4" REF="018273_0005_0FA5C977B25550A0">
hut near a maple grove, and continue boiling all night. In one of the&s;e huts was Mr. Up&s;on and Jonah Rogers, a lad thirteen years of age, they watched with the &s;ugar boiling-by turns; and at daybreaking Up&s;on having fini&s;hed his watch, was reclined on the floor a-&s;leep, and John was up, and at this time amu&s;ing him&s;elf in &s;ome trifles; when to his &s;urprize, a &s;avage &s;uddenly entered the hut, and immediately fired his piece through the bowels of Up&s;on, and with his toma|hawk &s;plit out his brains; a &s;econd of the&s;e frightful &s;emi-painted daemons immediately enter|ed, and &s;eized Jonah by the arm, when the whole gang pre&s;ently ru&s;hed into the hut, with their &s;hocking painted vi&s;ages and &s;avage &s;houtings, upon the devoted John, to who&s;e affrighted mind they pre&s;ented the utmo&s;t horrors of in&s;tant death, heightned by a glaring repre&s;entation of the infer|nal pit: they gave him to under&s;tand by their jargon dialect, which he partly under&s;tood, that he mu&s;t go with them; which in his pre&s;ent view was the more wretched alternative of in&s;tant death. He had no way to vent his horror but by immoderate crying, which the &s;avages &s;uppre&s;s'd by menaces of death; he then fell to &s;upplicating them with all his might, for liberty to go home; but the&s;e intreaties al&s;o the &s;avages &s;uppre&s;s'd by the &s;ame threats as before: thus the lad, advanc|ed far enough in life to anticipate the horrors of &s;avage cruelty and captivity, yet too young to &s;hare the full fortitude of manhood, not &s;uffered to vent his horror by crying, or daring to beg for
<PB N="5" REF="018273_0006_0FA5C97874554B08">
relief from his inexorable ma&s;ters, and not a mor|tal with whom to confer or condole, he was fix'd in a plethory of grief and di&s;pair, while the &s;ava|ges perfomed their dete&s;table cu&s;tom, by taking off the &s;calp of Mr. Up&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;avages next proceeded down the river, to a place called Fi&s;hing-Creek; where on Wedne&s;|day they &s;urpri&s;ed and took Me&s;&s;i. Peter Pence, Mo&s;es Van Campen and a lad named Mo&s;es Van Campen, nephew to the former. They continued lurking about until Friday, when they di&s;covered &s;ome &s;ugar works where the kettles were boiling; they concluded that the people had hid them&s;elves near by, whom they catch'd by the following &s;tratagem: they obliged the pri&s;oners to halloo, and call them out as if they were friends; this had the effect propo&s;ed, and brought out a Mr. Pike, with his wife and child; the man they re|tained as a pri&s;oner, but the woman and child they &s;pared, for the &s;ake of gratifying a humour of painting them in the indian manner, which they performed, and then &s;ent them home.</P>
<P>I may here ob&s;erve, that I don't remember to have heard an in&s;tance of the&s;e &s;avages offering to violate the cha&s;tity of any of the fair &s;ex who have fallen into their hands; this is principally owing to a natural inappetancy in their con&s;titutions; which circum&s;tance, were it otherwi&s;e, and were they equally nefarious in this, as in their other violations of the laws of nature and humanity, it would render their depredations, if po&s;&s;ible, much more demoniack than they are. This is an in|&s;tance,
<PB N="6" REF="018273_0007_0FA5C97926B8C3F8">
among numberle&s;s, which an ob&s;erving mind may perceive, where the wi&s;e Creator of all, in his a&s;&s;ignments of pa&s;&s;ions powers and proper|ties, has ballanced and &s;orted tho&s;e matters in a manner worthy of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;avages being now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of five pri&s;|oners, viz. Me&s;&s;rs. Pence, Van Campen, Pike, young Van Campen, &s;eventeen years of age, and Jonah Rogers, thirteen years old, together with a number of blankets, and a quantity of &s;ugar and indian meal which they had plundered in the &s;ugar-huts, which was all the provi&s;ion they had, they, without delay, &s;haped their cour&s;e for Nia|gara. They u&s;ually marched about 15 miles in a day. The lad Jonah, after being joined by the other pri&s;oners, recovered his &s;pirits, and being &s;omewhat humorous, rendered him&s;elf a great fa|vorite of the &s;avages. The pri&s;oners were mi&s;|erably &s;canted in their allowance of provi&s;ions, but Jonah grew bold and familiar, and had the addre&s;s to get as much as he plea&s;ed of any thing that the &s;avages had; &s;ome of which he u&s;ually imparted &s;ecretly to his fellow pri&s;oners, who were half &s;tarved, and obliged to &s;tagger along with all the baggage of the whole party, which was very hea|vy; and what rendered their duty doubly bur|then&s;ome the &s;now was up to their knees every &s;tep they trod, and all the chance any of them had for their lives, was from continuing this in|tolerable rout, 300 miles, to Niagara, without a|ny relief or refre&s;hment, excepting the hope of the &s;avages taking ven&s;ion, or other game by the
<PB N="7" REF="018273_0008_0FA5C97AA836C108">
way; and to render their condition completely de&s;perate, the indians, who&s;e &s;avage tempers can|not be &s;ufficiently gorged, &s;imply by the blood of their victims, but are greatly delighted in fre|quently reminding them of their approaching tortures, impoliticly informed the pri&s;oners that they were to be kept alive for the purpo&s;e of car|rying the baggage, until they had marched well toward Niagara, and then they &s;hould feel the tamahawk, and their &s;calps, not them&s;elves, be carried into Niagara; which &s;entence, it was ex|pected, would be put into execution, at lea&s;t on &s;ome of them, e&s;pecially on Mr. Pike, of whom they were apprehen&s;ive, on account of his having been a continental &s;oldier.</P>
<P>In the&s;e de&s;perate circum&s;tances, it is ea&s;y to conceive, that people would be led to meditate, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome way of e&s;cape; to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight, was impracticable, as the &s;avages were fleeter than them&s;elves, and would pur&s;ue with fire arms, with fatal effect on the fugitives; the only chance was to ri&s;e by night, di&s;arm and at|tack the &s;avages: but if we con&s;ider that the pri&s;oners had their hands carefully &s;ecured behind them both night and day, and carefully deprived of any uten&s;il that might be u&s;ed to &s;eperate their ligatures; and that the enemy were active and watchful, and more than double in number to tho&s;e who were able to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;uch an enterprize; and that the cruele&s;t death that &s;avages could in|flict, would be practi&s;ed on them, in ca&s;e their plot &s;hould be di&s;covered, or mi&s;carry; I &s;ay, if we
<PB N="8" REF="018273_0009_0FA5C97AD45667D8">
con&s;ider the&s;e things, we may form &s;ome idea of the bravery, or rather de&s;peration which in&s;pired &s;uch an attempt. Some one of them fir&s;t project|ed the enterprize, and when they had opportunity of conference on the march, the propo&s;al was made to the re&s;t, who all concurred on the fir&s;t motion, without the lea&s;t reluctance or he&s;i|tation in any one of them; and on the next Fri|day after they began their march, they re&s;olved to put the plan into execution the en&s;uing night. They faithfully promi&s;e each other by all the ties of honor and common calamity, to &s;tand by each other, and abide the combat, if fate &s;o required, even to the &s;pending their la&s;t drops of blood. Their plan expre&s;sly agreed on, was as follows: each one was to watch his opportunity, if po&s;&s;ible, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of &s;ome in&s;trument, wherewith to &s;eparate the cords which tied his hands behind him, and if any one &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to &s;ecure an in&s;trument, he was at night, when the indians were well a&s;leep, to cut him&s;elf loo&s;e; and then liberate the others him&s;elf, or reach the in&s;tru|ment to his neare&s;t fellow, as he &s;hould judge &s;afe&s;t, and to be handed if po&s;&s;ible, until all were loo&s;e; this done, each one was, with the utmo&s;t addre&s;s, dexterity and &s;tilne&s;s, to &s;ecure &s;uch arms and am|munition, as were mo&s;t contiguous, to him, and nimbly repair therewith to a certain &s;pot of rendez|vous, about two rods di&s;tant from where they couched by the &s;ide of a fire; when, if lei&s;ure would permit, they were farther to con&s;ult on the particular mode of attack, and to a&s;&s;ign to each
<PB N="9" REF="018273_0010_0FA5C97B6E5B14A8">
man his duty, or in whatever &s;tage of the plot af|ter they were loo&s;e, the &s;avagegs might take the alarm, each man was to catch &s;ome weapon, and without giving the &s;avages a moment's time to re|cover from their con&s;ternation, were to attack them with all fury, and at once put the matter to a fi|nal i&s;&s;ue. But when night came on, no one had been able to &s;ecure any kind of tool, wherewith to cut him&s;elf loo&s;e; they however, when the &s;av|ages were a&s;leep, &s;truggled and &s;trove to get their hands at liberty; but all in vain. The night pa&s;&s;ed without effecting any thing, and happily, without exciting the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>On Saturday it was agreed at all events to bring matters to a cri&s;is the en&s;uing night; they all as one declared they would march no farther toward Niagara. By Saturday night they had marched 75 miles; their lodging was as follows: after erecting a fire, they &s;pread down their blankets, of which they now had &s;uch a plenty as to afford them a comfortable bed and covering. One circum&s;tance worthy of notice in this place is, that the &s;avages were &s;o infe&s;ted with lice&punc; that they could not &s;leep quietly with their claoths on, and this being a cold night, they &s;tript off even their &s;hirts, and expo&s;ed them on &s;ome bu&s;hes to freeze, in order to thin the lice; whence it hap|pened, that when they turned out in the alarm at midnight, they were &s;tark naked. Pike had ob|&s;erved that the indian whom he was taught to call his ma&s;ter, when he went to &s;leep, laid his knife under his body, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of by
<PB N="10" REF="018273_0011_0FA5C97C56628B88">
the following art: pretending a great fondne&s;s for his &s;aid ma&s;ter, he begged the favour of &s;leep|ing at night by his &s;ide, and had the dexterity when the indians were a&s;leep, to extract the knife unperceived, wherewith he cut him&s;elf loo&s;e. Mr. Pence likewi&s;e being allowed a knife at &s;upper time, in&s;tead of returning it, droped and covered it in a certain place by the couch; and when the indians demanded his knife, he pretended that it had been &s;urrendered up, and &s;o it pa&s;&s;ed over; and when the &s;avages were a&s;leep, he re&s;umed his knife, and cut him&s;elf loo&s;e; and by means of the&s;e two knives, all the pri&s;oners were &s;oon at liberty, excepting Jonah, whom it was thought be&s;t not to awake; every one, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, got hold of &s;ome kind of weapon, expecting every moment the &s;avages would be upon their legs, give the yell of war, and commence a violent at|tack, with the inequality of ten to four; but &s;till they &s;lept. One grand object was &s;ecureing the fire arms; tho&s;e were all &s;et again&s;t a tree at the head of the couch, and were pre&s;ently removed to a place appointed, about two rods di&s;tant, by the &s;ide of a tree. Some ammunition they likewi&s;e &s;ecured; with which they even had lei&s;ure to prime their pieces, which the indians, previous to their lying down, had cautiou&s;ly unprimed. Thus in the &s;pace of a few lucky moments, the&s;e four men, with the mo&s;t cautious dexerity, deprived ten &s;av|ages, not only of their fire arms, but nearly of all their tomakawks, removed them to the &s;pot a&s;|&s;igned, and after a ha&s;ty, but very wi&s;e and pru|dent
<PB N="11" REF="018273_0012_0FA5C97E9742A6A0">
con&s;ultation, it was re&s;olved that two men &s;hould &s;tand by the guns, and fire upon the &s;ava|ges as they ro&s;e up, and during the conflict; the other two men took each a tomahawk, and with undaunted bravery, advanced to the couch where the ten indians lay, in order to commence the at|tack, one on each &s;ide of the couch; they uncov|ered the indians heads, and with an unerring blow, each &s;truck his tomahawk into the brains of an indian, killing both in an in&s;tant; the other eight indians &s;prang up the &s;ame moment, and at once perceived that their arms were not only taken from them, but fatally turned again&s;t them&s;elves, and moved by that cowardly qualm which naturally ri&s;|es in bo&s;oms that delight in cruelty, they &s;camp|ered off as quick as they aro&s;e, without giving the two men time to give a &s;econd blow. The two men who &s;tood by the guns, &s;aluted the indians as they aro&s;e, and pur&s;ued them as they fled with the &s;ame &s;alutation, as far as their naked precipi|tation would permit; they &s;orely wounded &s;ome, which appeared from a profu&s;ion of blood which they &s;prinkled on the &s;now as they fled: the &s;now at this time had a hard cru&s;t, yet not &s;o &s;trong but what they broke through almo&s;t every &s;tep; this had a &s;ad opperation on their naked &s;hins, which their pre&s;ent trouble and ha&s;te would not permit them to take any care of: &s;ome &s;mall de|fence for their legs in this race would have afford|ed them no &s;mall comfort, as they were oblig|ed to abandon them to the cru&s;t, which mang|led them mo&s;t pitifully, which appeared the
<PB N="12" REF="018273_0013_0FA5C98008A95C88">
next morning by the numberle&s;s fragments of fle&s;h and &s;kin, which they left by their tracks, many of which were as big as dollars. Jonah being a|&s;leep with the indians, &s;tarted in &s;urpri&s;e and con|fu&s;ion, and run off with them a few rods, but re|collecting the plan to which he had been privy, he leaped back to the company; Pike humour|ou&s;ly gave him a cuff on the ear, &s;aying, what you ra&s;cal, was you going to run off with the indians? They were now all enraptured with their deliver|ance and victory, which was every way compleat, equal, or even &s;uperior to the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of their fancy and fond wi&s;hes. Their joy was mix|ed with a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;o rare and &s;urpri&s;ing an event; which &s;o dazzled their imaginations, that they could &s;carcely believe and realize facts, &s;upported by the in&s;tant te&s;timony of all their &s;en&s;es. How great and &s;udden was their change of circum&s;tances! From the &s;evere&s;t &s;ufferings, and the mo&s;t ill-boding apprehen&s;ions of extreme woe, under &s;avage captivity, by a bold and manly execution of a wi&s;e concerted plan, they, in the &s;pace of a few minutes, vanqui&s;hed the whole party of &s;avages, &s;o &s;uperior in number, that they deemed it needle&s;s to keep a guard; po&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of their effects, and completely regained their liberty.</P>
<P>It was practiced in antient times, even by hea|then writers, in ca&s;es of &s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> deliverance to a&s;|cribe the efficiency thereof to the power of Deity; and it would be unpardonable in an American, at a day of &s;uch &s;triking manife&s;tations of divine
<PB N="13" REF="018273_0014_0FA5C9816CA36DE0">
patronage, not to a&s;cribe to the au&s;picious provi|dence of Deity, not only the more general and important &s;peciments of aid, but every &s;ubordinate in&s;tance, and in &s;pecial the pre&s;ent. Who can conceive, that men without &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance, could ari&s;e in the night, in &s;uch an attempt again&s;t &s;uch &s;uperior number of indians, who are alert and vigilent, and ever jealous in the extreme, cut them&s;elves loo&s;e, &s;ecure the arms, and perform all the nece&s;&s;ary tran&s;actions, moving about on the &s;now, crumping around their ears, without arou&s;|ing tho&s;e infernal dogs; and then, that they &s;hould in&s;tantly vanqui&s;h them, without a con|flict, when they could but know, that naked and de&s;titute, they mu&s;t inevitably and mi&s;erably freeze and &s;tarve, &s;hort of reaching any relief, which proved in fact to be their awful fate, their guilty con&s;ciences &s;ufficiently remon&s;trating a|gain&s;t turning about and &s;ubmitting to the mercy of their victors. They probably &s;et their faces toward Niagara, 230 miles di&s;tant, without arms, or a &s;crap of cloathing or food, and have never been heard of &s;ince, which occa&s;ioned great mournings at Niagara, as &s;ome pri&s;oners inform. It is probable that the operation of famine and fro&s;t, landed tho&s;e wretches, one after another, on a bed of &s;now, where they left the world, literally as naked as they came into it. Their horrid fate, had it fallen to the &s;hare even of wild bea&s;ts, ought to have moved compa&s;&s;ion in every human brea&s;t; but when we con&s;ider how richly tho&s;e mon&s;ters merited their fate by the mo&s;t un|provoked,
<PB N="14" REF="018273_0015_0FA5C982E794D3E8">
needle&s;s and voluntary ho&s;tilities, pro&s;e|cuted with the mo&s;t wanton &s;tretches of inhuman|ity and guilt, it moderates the pang of &s;ympathy, and con&s;trains the minds of the compa&s;&s;ionate, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to acquie&s;ce in the providential ex|erci&s;e of tho&s;e puni&s;hments, which human nature could not bare to inflict on the mo&s;t accummulat|ed guilt.</P>
<P>Our people &s;pent the remaining part of the night very agreeably by the fire &s;ide, without any fear of the vanqui&s;hed &s;avages. The booty which the indians left, was more than they could bring home, which determined them to make a raft of timber on the Su&s;quehannah, in order to tran&s;port them&s;elves, with their effects down the river; but this unluckily run aground, by which means they lo&s;t all their provi&s;ions and booty, excepting their fire arms, with which they made the be&s;t of their way home, having 75 miles to mea&s;ure back, without any provi&s;ions but what they could catch by the way. They travelled until Monday, when they killed a raccoon, and on Tue&s;day found the carca&s;s of a deer, lately killed; with which re|fre&s;hments they reached the &s;ettlements on Thur&s;|day. At their unexpected return, with the ac|count of their brilliant exploits, as we may well judge, they were heartily congratulated.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much of the ten &s;avages, I proceed to a tale of the &s;ix. The&s;e made their appearance on Monday the 27th of March, near a place called King&s;ton, within the limits of We&s;t|moreland, where they &s;oon kidnapped Thomas
<PB N="15" REF="018273_0016_0FA5C9830FD28980">
Bennet, with his &s;on, twelve years old, and a Mr. Hammond, and without delay, &s;et out for Niaga|ra. The treatment they received from the &s;ava|ges, was rough and menacing, e&s;pecially Bennet, with whom they had long been acquainted, and at who&s;e hou&s;e they had been entertained: Such is the perfidious nature of the&s;e wretches, like the immortal Arnold, and his brethren, that ho&s;tilities, and inhumanity exerci&s;ed on an old acquaintance, e&s;pecially a friendly one, but &s;erves more highly to &s;ea&s;on their ta&s;te for inhumanity and &s;avage tri|umph. In &s;hort, as to &s;ituation and pro&s;pects, the&s;e people were &s;imilar to tho&s;e who were pri&s;|oners to the other party of indians, which I need not repeat; they were reduced to the &s;ame de&s;per|ate alternative, which naturally in the&s;e brave men, produced a &s;imilar re&s;olution. On Tue&s;day they agreed to attack the &s;ix indians the en&s;uing night, with the inequality of two to &s;ix, they placing no dependence on the boy. They were to endeavour, in couching at night, to place them&s;elves as favourable as they could, and to take the be&s;t ob&s;ervation, as to where the indians placed their weapons, when they went to &s;leep, and by all means, each was to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of a tomahawk, and watching each the others motion, Bennet was to give the &s;ignal, when both were to ri&s;e in an in&s;tant, and addre&s;s them&s;elves to the indians with their tomahawks, in the true &s;avage ta&s;te.

to ari&s;e in the de&s;perate attempt, it &s;o happened that one of the indians began to &s;tir, and lift up his head, and pre&s;ently rai&s;ed up his body, and &s;at by the fire &s;ide, putting the fuel in order: Bennet determined &s;till to pur&s;ue the plan, and not let it die thus in embryo, began to &s;tretch him&s;elf as if ju&s;t awake from &s;leep, and entered into &s;ome &s;mall conver&s;ation with the indian, in order to amu&s;e him; be pre&s;ently aro&s;e, and &s;tood on his feet, turning him&s;elf by the fire, and watching a favour|able moment to put into execution the daring plan, which greatly &s;welled and heaved in their anxious bo&s;oms&punc; Hammond lay as if a&s;leep, though ready, and waiting the &s;ignal to &s;pring and &s;econd the blow of his fellow. Bennet began lei&s;urely to renew his reque&s;t for liberty to return home, promi&s;ing, that if he might go home, he would &s;upply them in a friendly manner with provi&s;ions, whenever they &s;hould apply; at this the indian turned up his face, pointing upwards with his finger; and in token of contempt, cries out with an indian accent, pee; at this in&s;tant, Bennit took his tomahawk, and with a violent blow buried it in the brains of the indian; Ham|mond &s;prang at the &s;ame time, and with a lucky blow killed another; the other four indians im|mediately aro&s;e, and turned to run, when Ham|mond, by a &s;econd blow, wounded a third deep|ly between his &s;houlders; Bennit's weapon was &s;o fa&s;tened in the indian's &s;kull, that he could not extract it for a &s;econd blow, but catched up a long indian &s;pear which was at hand, and before

they were out of reach, he pu&s;hed it quite thro' the trunk of a fourth indian's body, who ran off with the &s;ame in his body, as did likewi&s;e he that received a wound from Hammond, with the two &s;ound indians, never pre&s;uming to contend; though had they dared to face the a&s;&s;ailants, and put the matter to the i&s;&s;ue of bodily &s;trength, they might have had more than an equal chance; but properties of &s;uch oppo&s;ite natures as bravery and cruelty, cannot exi&s;t in the &s;ame brea&s;t. Our people from being pri&s;oners to &s;avages, &s;uddenly became pri&s;oners of rapture and amazement, at &s;uch an extraordinary deliverance, and victory. They &s;ecured the arms, and without delay return|ed home to their applauding friends. It appears by &s;ome after di&s;coveries, that the indians &s;kulk|ed about in the dark, until they perceived that our people had left the ground, when they came to the place, and picked up &s;ome provi&s;ions and cloathing, hid their dead between &s;ome logs, in which point the indians are very a&s;&s;iduous, and marched for Niagara. The two &s;avages who e&s;|caped unhurt at this time, were all that reached Niagara, out of &s;ixteen, to report the &s;orrowful fate to their &s;hamele&s;s employers.</P>
<P>To this narrative it may not be wholly imper|tenent to &s;ubjoin a few hints concerning the reli|gion, government, cu&s;toms and manners of the aborigines of this country.</P>
<P>As to religion, the&s;e aborigines, though they are perhaps the mo&s;t rude and illiterate of all the human race, yet the principle of natural religion
<PB N="18" REF="018273_0019_0FA5C9852C25ECF8">
are not wholly extingui&s;hed in them; and indeed, though &s;ome authors have amu&s;ed the world with tales of whole nations of athei&s;ts, more ab&s;urd to a man of thought, than the idea of nations of ideots and pigmies; yet I appeal to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, whether the grand leading ideas of an all-wi&s;e, all-ruling Being, the deathle&s;s na|ture of mind, and a futute reckoning would not naturally ari&s;e in the mind of every thinking man, with an irre&s;i&s;table conclu&s;ion, though he were dive&s;ted of all the partialities of education. The&s;e animals, though they trample on the rights of humanity, and the dictate of nature, yet &s;eem to have &s;ome confu&s;ed ideas of the&s;e leading points, as I have been informed. They addre&s;s the Su|preme Being under the title of the Great Man, and frequently pronounce mandates, pre&s;ages and oracles, which they pretend to receive from him, on many occa&s;ions, and more e&s;pecially at their powows, a kind of bea&s;tly ma&s;querade or frolic. There is a notion prevails among them, that when one is &s;lain in battle, if the enemy get his body, he will fare wor&s;e for it after his decea&s;e, and for this rea&s;on they will hazard their lives more to bring off the bodies of the &s;lain, than in almo&s;t any other attempt. A notable in&s;tance of this kind, we had a few years pa&s;t, in an action at We&s;tmorland: It is a&s;&s;erted, by all conver&s;ant a|mong the indians, that at their funerals they prac|tice burying bottles of rum, tomahawks, and &s;uch things as the de&s;ea&s;ed were mo&s;t fond of, with them in their graves. Such rude cu&s;toms,
<PB N="19" REF="018273_0020_0FA5C985F5B13D40">
con&s;onant to the ignorance of &s;avages, di&s;covers an a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e natural principles of religion. Tho&s;e who believe there is a God, and after a natural death, that they &s;hall &s;urvive in his pre|&s;ence and dominion, cannot &s;uppre&s;s the idea of retribution. It is &s;aid that among the&s;e &s;avages, when one commits any abominable crimes, which are &s;hocking in their view, they treat him with abhorrence, and &s;uppo&s;e that the vengeance of heaven will &s;urely overtake him.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are as wholly de&s;titute of any kind of government, as any of the human &s;pecies can be. There is no kind of animals which herd together, but have &s;ome kind of government: a|mong cattle, rank is determined by bodily &s;trength and activity; each one knows his &s;uperiors and inferiors, and when a &s;tranger is added to the flock, the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s is to determine his rank, which is ordinarily done without much &s;trife&punc; this &s;alutary regulation, &s;uited to their natures produces general tranquility. Gee&s;e that pa&s;s and repa&s;s our country, &s;pring and autumn, for change of climate, flying in regular wedges, with a cer|tain one at head to direct their way, have a kind of in&s;tinctive policy in a&s;&s;igning the time and place of rendezvous, and appointing an expert leader: &s;o the&s;e &s;avages when they hear the din of war, if there are white people inhuman enough to encourage them to &s;kulk, &s;urpri&s;e, kill and capattive the unwary or defencele&s;s, which are their only exploits, they repair to their &s;tandard, and appoint or acknowledge certain leaders, whom
<PB N="20" REF="018273_0021_0FA5C9874C7813E0">
they obey only in proportion to their natural talents, to awe, influence and command them: the&s;e are what they commonly &s;tile head warriors; be&s;ides which, e&s;pecially in times of peace, there are tho&s;e whom they &s;tile great men; and if one of the&s;e becomes eminent above the re&s;t, and &s;o continue for a number of years, perhaps he ob|tains the title of &s;achem, The&s;e great men are &s;uch to whom nature has been &s;omewhat more liberal in the be&s;towment of &s;en&s;e and &s;tability, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on divers oc|ca&s;ions, or have a commanding addre&s;s and de|portment; by &s;uch means they of cour&s;e obtain what I would call a natural authority: this kind of authority obviou&s;ly obtains among all man|kind, by an irre&s;i&s;table law of nature: con&s;picu|ous excellence commands ob&s;equious deference. I am well informed the&s;e great men have con&s;ider|able awe over the re&s;t, who pay a very con&s;idera|ble deference to their opinion and advice when they are under their in&s;pection, and free from &s;trong drink and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t we &s;hould form too re&s;pectable an idea of the&s;e great men, we may con&s;ider that they are drunk as often as they have cider, rum, or other &s;pirits, and are frequently guilty of as gro&s;s enormities as the re&s;t. The&s;e are the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent ideas I can form from the &s;mall infor|mation I have had, and the few ob&s;ervations I have made concerning rulers and authority among the indians, though I am willing to &s;ubmit to the opinion of any who may be otherwi&s;e and better
<PB N="21" REF="018273_0022_0FA5C98770143658">
informed, I think I have repre&s;ented them with as much dignity in the&s;e matters, as the &s;pecimens of their government will po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport. It is univer&s;ally acknowledged that there is no authori|ty among them that pretends to inflict any kind of puni&s;hment on tho&s;e who commit any kind of crimes; if this be &s;o, it is &s;ufficient to my pur|po&s;e, and without any comment, proves the e&s;&s;en|tials of government and authority to be wholly wanting. Murder is no very uncommon crime among them; they frequently gorge their unhal|lowed pa&s;&s;ions by mauling and &s;tabing the objects of them to death; and herein the fear of puni&s;h|ment does not much excite the caution of doing it by night, or in a &s;olitary, place but whenever their pa&s;&s;ions and malice impels; the perpetrator ex|pects perhaps to be called by &s;ome an ugly fel|low for a while, but is apprehen&s;ive of no puni&s;h|ment, unle&s;s &s;ome relative or friend of the &s;lain has bravery enough to avenge his death. I was &s;ome years pa&s;t at an indian &s;ettlement, and &s;aw a recent grave where a murdered indian had a few days before been buried; the murderer was about among the others, and though this was in the chief town of that tribe or nation, yet no other notice was taken of the matter, than that the more &s;teady people viewed the murderer as a wretch, whom the vengeance of heaven would &s;ome time over|take. If no avenger aro&s;e in that ca&s;e, as I doubt whether any did, I conclude the odium declined with time, adding one to their numberle&s;s &s;tigmas of national guilt. It is common for a relative or
<PB N="22" REF="018273_0023_0FA5C98832C0EF68">
friend in &s;uch a ca&s;e, to avenge the murder, and &s;ometimes the avenger meets the vengeance of a third, and &s;o on until &s;everal fall. I &s;ubmit to common &s;en&s;e the idea of a &s;overeign or &s;achem pre&s;iding over &s;uch a tribe.</P>
<P>Theft and robbery among them are venial crimes&punc; which renders their &s;mall property very precarious, and di&s;courages the acqui&s;ition of more, were they di&s;po&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>As to marriage, it is attended with &s;ome &s;mall ceremony among them; but an indian whenever he plea&s;es, turns off one wife and takes an other: it is a little extraordinary for a man and woman to live together during life. It is &s;aid that if their wives happen to be too familiar with another indian, the hu&s;band is apt enough to re&s;ent it, but not &s;o if with a white debauchee.</P>
<P>There is in the vicinity of &s;ome, if not all in|dian towns, a hou&s;e con&s;tructed, called the wo|man hou&s;e, to which their women periodically re|&s;ort; to this the males never pre&s;ume to approach, but if their bu&s;ine&s;s calls them that way, they &s;hun it by a circuitous walk; if the males have occa&s;ion to carry them any nece&s;&s;aries, they leave the &s;ame at a certain di&s;tance, where, when they are gone, the women go and fetch it; this cu&s;tom re&s;embles one ob&s;erved by the antient Jews. The manner of burying their dead, is to &s;eat the body on the &s;urface of the earth, with the trunk erect, and placing in his arms &s;uch things as u&s;ed to delight him in his life, and which they &s;uppo&s;e will be u&s;eful to him in future, they cover him
<PB N="23" REF="018273_0024_0FA5C989A8BE6798">
with a pile of earth; the&s;e piles are &s;ometimes flatted down by &s;ome means or other, and leave the bones and funeral trea&s;ure above ground.</P>
<P>The indians are univer&s;ally intemperate in drink|ing; both males and females never fail of intox|icating them&s;elves whenever they have the means. They are a mo&s;t lazy, indolent generation, e&s;peci|ally the males, who by their greater &s;trength, and total want of delicacy, oblige the &s;quaws to per|form all the mo&s;t laborious and fatiguing employ|ments; the&s;e, u&s;e has taught to carry the mo&s;t incredible burthens when they travel to and fro, and on all occa&s;ions, while the males walk in their company without offering to partake of the burthen.</P>
<P>A gentleman of veracity who had re&s;ided con|&s;iderably among them informed me, that he never ob&s;erved any of the males to attempt any dome&s;|tic labour, but at one particular time, when the &s;quaws were much involved in bu&s;ine&s;s, they pro|po&s;ed an entertainment, and invited the men to a&s;&s;emble and hoe a field of corn for them, which they accordingly did, and then partook of the re|pa&s;t which the &s;quaws had provided, which was a pig cooked with &s;ome indian corn and beans, the fle&s;h was carved into as many parts as their were gue&s;ts, of which my informant by &s;pecial invita|tion was one, each was pre&s;ented with his &s;hare of fle&s;h fixed on a &s;harpened &s;tick, and were told if any cho&s;e to refre&s;h them&s;elves with the &s;auce, and carry the fle&s;h home, they were at liberty &s;o to do; accordingly &s;ome eat their allowance on the &s;pot, and others bore theirs home.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="018273_0025_0FA5C98A697F9C88">The indians by way of ornament, pa&s;s a knife quite around the circumferrence of their ears, &s;e|parating an annular piece of cartilage, near half an inch in width, which they curiou&s;ly wind with wampum, but this is pre&s;ently broken by &s;ome accident in their &s;ylvan walks, and the &s;trips are left pendulous. They likewi&s;e paint one half of thir faces with a deep red, which gives them a ve|ry frightful appearance. What little cloathing that they wear, is made either of &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts, or &s;ome coar&s;e cloath when they can get it. The women wear a kind of petticoat reaching preci&s;ely to their knees, and the men &s;omething of &s;mall width fa&s;tened about their loins, and both &s;exes a blanket, which is their chief garment, thrown over the whole; if they happen to get a linnen &s;hirt, it is full mounted with ruffles of the &s;ame, &s;eldom fa&s;tened at the collar or wri&s;tbands, and never put off for wa&s;hing until it is worn to rags.</P>
