<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE formerly taken the liberty of holding &s;ome prefatory di&s;cour&s;e with my readers, on the &s;ubject of tho&s;e little hi&s;tories, which accident had enabled me to lay before them. This is pro|bably the la&s;t time I &s;hall make u&s;e of their indul|gence; and even, if this Introduction &s;hould be found &s;uperfluous, it may claim their pardon, as the parting addre&s;s of one, who has endeavoured to contribute to their entertainment.</P>
<P>I was favoured la&s;t &s;ummer with a vi&s;it from a gentleman, a native of <HI>France,</HI> with who&s;e father I had been intimately acquainted when I was la&s;t in that country. I confe&s;s my&s;elf particularly de|lighted with an intercour&s;e, which removes the barrier of national di&s;tinction, and gives to the in|habitants of the world the appearance of one common family. I received, therefore, this young
<PB N="iv" REF="017578_0003_0FBA6F4CEF91BC00">
Frenchman into that humble &s;hed, which Provi|dence has allowed my age to re&s;t in, with peculiar &s;atisfaction, and was rewarded, for any little at|tention I had in my power to &s;hew him, by acquir|ing the friend&s;hip of one, whom I found to in|herit all that paternal worth, which had fixed my e&s;teem, about a dozen years ago, in <HI>Paris.</HI> In truth, &s;uch attention always rewards it&s;elf; and, I believe, my own feelings, which I expre&s;&s;ed to this amiable and accompli&s;hed Frenchman on his leaving <HI>England,</HI> are &s;uch as every one will own, who&s;e mind is &s;u&s;ceptible of feeling at all. He was profu&s;e of thanks, to which my good offices had no title, but from the inclination that ac|companied them.&mdash;<HI>Ici, Mon&s;ieur,</HI> (&s;aid I, for he had u&s;ed a language more accommodated than ours to the le&s;&s;er order of &s;entiments, and I an&s;wered him, as well as long want of practice would al|low me, in the &s;ame tongue)&mdash;<HI>Ici, Mon&s;ieur, ob|&s;cur &amp; inconnu, avec beaucoup de bienveillance, mais peu de pouvoir, je ne go&ucirc;te point d'un plai&s;ir plus &s;incere, que de pen&s;er, qu'il y a, dans aucun quar|tier du monde, une ame honn&ecirc;te, qui &s;e &s;ouvient de moi avec reconnoi&s;&s;ance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="017578_0004_0FBA6F5037BBBB10">
But I am talking of my&s;elf, when I &s;hould be giving an account of the following papers. This gentleman, di&s;cour&s;ing with me on the &s;ubject of tho&s;e letters, the &s;ub&s;tance of which I formerly publi&s;hed under the title of <HI>The Man of the World,</HI> ob&s;erved, that if the de&s;ire of &s;earching into the records of private life were common, the di&s;covery of &s;uch collections would cea&s;e to be wondered at. "We look (&s;aid he) for the Hi&s;|tories of Men, among tho&s;e of high rank; but memoirs of &s;entiment, and &s;uffering, may be found in every condition.</P>
<P>"My father (continued my young friend) made, &s;ince you &s;aw him, an acqui&s;ition of that nature, by a whim&s;ical accident. Standing one day at the door of a grocery &s;hop, making enquiry as to the lodgings of &s;ome per&s;on of his acquaint|ance, a little boy pa&s;&s;ed him with a bundle of papers in his hand, which he offered for &s;ale to the ma&s;ter of the &s;hop, for the ordinary u&s;es of his trade; but they differed about the price, and the boy was ready to depart, when my father de|&s;ired
<PB N="vi" REF="017578_0005_0FBA6F51C241BE58">
a &s;ight of the papers, &s;aying to the lad, with a &s;mile, that, perhaps, he might deal with him for his book; upon reading a &s;entence or two, he found a &s;tile much above that of the ordinary manu&s;cripts of a grocery-&s;hop, and gave the boy his price, at a venture, for the whole. When he had got home, and examined the parcel, he di&s;covered it to con|&s;i&s;t of letters put up, for the mo&s;t part, according to their dates, which he committed to me, as having, he &s;aid, better eyes, and a keener curio|&s;ity, than his. I found them to contain a &s;tory in detail, which, I believe, would intere&s;t one of your turn of thinking a good deal. If you choo&s;e to undergo the trouble of the peru&s;al, I &s;hall take care to have them &s;ent over to you by the fir&s;t op|portunity I can find, and if you will do the Public the favour to dige&s;t them, as you did tho&s;e of <HI>An|ne&s;ly</HI> and his children."&mdash;My young Frenchman &s;peaks the language of compliment; but I do not choo&s;e to tran&s;late any further. It is enough to &s;ay, that I received his papers &s;ome time ago, and that they are tho&s;e which I have tran&s;lated, and now give to the world. I had perhaps treated them as I did the letters he mentioned; but I
<PB N="vii" REF="017578_0006_0FBA6F5340C31180">
found it a difficult ta&s;k to reduce them into nar|rative, becau&s;e they are made up of &s;entiment, which narrative would de&s;troy. The only power I have exerci&s;ed over them, is that of omitting letters, and pa&s;&s;ages of letters, which &s;eem to bear no relation to the &s;tory I mean to communi|cate. In doing this, however, I confe&s;s I have been cautious: I love my&s;elf (and am apt there|fore, from a common &s;ort of weakne&s;s, to imagine that other people love) to read nature in her &s;malle&s;t character, and am often more appri&s;ed of the &s;tate of the mind, from very trifling, than from very important circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>As, from age and &s;ituation, it is likely I &s;hall addre&s;s the Public no more, I cannot avoid taking this opportunity, of thanking it for the reception it has given, to tho&s;e humble pages which I for|merly introduced to its notice. Unknown, and unpatronized, I had little preten&s;ion to its favour and little expectation of it; writing, or arranging the writings of others, was, to me, only a fa|vourite amu&s;ement, for which a man ea&s;ily finds both time and apology. One advantage I drew
<PB N="viii" REF="017578_0007_0FBA6F5510D04E58">
from it, which the humane may hear with &s;atis|faction; I often wandered from my own woe, in tracing the tale of another's affliction, and, at this moment, every &s;entence I write, I am but e&s;caping a little farther from the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Of the merit or faults of the compo&s;ition, in the volumes of which I have directed the publi|cation, a &s;mall &s;hare only was mine; for their tendency I hold my&s;elf entirely accountable, be|cau&s;e, had it been a bad one, I had the power of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them; and from their tendency, I be|lieve, more than any other quality belonging to them, has the indulgence of their readers ari&s;en. For that indulgence I de&s;ire to return them my grateful acknowledgments as an editor; I &s;hall be proud with better rea&s;on, if there is nothing to be found, in my publications, that may forfeit their e&s;teem as a man.</P>

JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute;. A SENTIMENTAL NOVEL. IN A SERIES OF LETTERS.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I. JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute; TO MARIA DE RONCILLES.</HEAD>
<P>"THE friend&s;hip of your Maria misfor|tune can never deprive you of."&mdash;The&s;e were the words with which you &s;ealed that attach|ment we had formed in the bli&s;sful period of in|fancy. The remembrance of tho&s;e peaceful days we pa&s;&s;ed together in the convent, is often recall|ed to my mind, amid&s;t the cares of the pre&s;ent. Yet do not think me fooli&s;h enough to complain of the want of tho&s;e plea&s;ures which affluence gave us; the &s;ituation of my father's affairs is &s;uch as to exclude luxury, but it allows happine&s;s; and, were it not for the recollection of what he
<PB N="2" REF="017578_0009_0FBA6F5A82738488">
once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which now and then intrudes it|&s;elf upon him, he could &s;carce form a wi&s;h that were not gratified in the retreat he has found.</P>
<P>You were wont to call me the little philo|&s;opher; if it be philo&s;ophy to feel no violent di&s;tre&s;s from that change which the ill-fortune of our family has made in its circum&s;tances, I do not claim much merit from being that way a philo|&s;opher. From my earlie&s;t days I found my&s;elf un|ambitious of wealth or grandeur, contented with the enjoyment of &s;eque&s;tered life, and fearful of the dangers which attend an exalted &s;tation. It is therefore more properly a weakne&s;s, than a vir|tue, in me, to be &s;atisfied with my pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation.</P>
<P>But, after all, my friend, what is it we have lo&s;t? We have exchanged the life of gaiety, of tumults, of plea&s;ure they call it, which we led in Paris, when my father was a rich man; for the pure, the peaceful, the truly happy &s;cenes which this place affords us, now he is a poor one. Dependence and poverty alone are &s;uffered to complain; but they know not how often great|ne&s;s is dependent, and wealth is poor. Formerly, even during the very &s;hort &s;pace of the year we were at <HI>Belville,</HI> it was vain to think of that dome&s;tic enjoyment I u&s;ed to hope for in the coun|try;
<PB N="3" REF="017578_0010_0FBA6F5E8F4F2C98">
we were people of too much con&s;equence to be allowed the privilege of retirement, and ex|cept tho&s;e luxurious walks I &s;ometimes found means to take&mdash;with you, my dear, I mean&mdash;the day was as little my own, as in the mid&s;t of our win|ter hurry in town.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of this momentous law-&s;uit has brought us down to the level of tranquility. Our days are not now pre-occupied by numberle&s;s engage|ments, nor our time anxiou&s;ly divided for a rota|tion of amu&s;ements; I can walk, read, or think, without the officious interruption of polite vi&s;itors; and, in&s;tead of talking eternally of others, I find time to &s;ettle accounts with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Could we but prevail on my father to think thus!&mdash;Alas! his mind is not formed for contract|ing into that narrow &s;phere, which his fortune has now marked out for him. He feels adver&s;ity a defeat, to which the vanqui&s;hed &s;ubmit, with pride in their looks, but angui&s;h in their hearts. He is cut off from the enjoyment of his pre&s;ent &s;tate, while he puts him&s;elf under the cruel ne|ce&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;embling his regret for the lo&s;s of the former.</P>
<P>I can ea&s;ily perceive how much my deare&s;t mo|ther is affected by this. I &s;ee her con&s;tantly on the watch for every word and look that may di&s;|cover
<PB N="4" REF="017578_0011_0FBA6F60790A7A60">
his feelings; and &s;he has, too often, occa|&s;ion to ob&s;erve them unfavourable. She endea|vours, and commonly &s;ucceeds in her endeavour, to put on the appearance of cheerfulne&s;s; &s;he even tries to per&s;uade her&s;elf that &s;he has rea&s;on to be contented; but, alas! an effort to be happy, is always but an increa&s;e of our unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>And what is left for your JULIA to do? In truth, I fear, I am of little &s;ervice. My heart is too much intere&s;ted in the &s;cene, to allow me that command over my&s;elf, which would make me u&s;eful. My father often remarks, that I look grave; I &s;mile (fooli&s;hly I fear) and deny it; it is, I believe, no more than I u&s;ed to do formerly; but we were then in a &s;ituation that did not lead him to ob&s;erve it. He had no con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in him&s;elf, to prompt the ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>How often do I wi&s;h for you, MARIA, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me! There is &s;omething in that &s;mile of yours (I paint it to my&s;elf at this in&s;tant) which care and &s;orrow are unable to with&s;tand; be&s;ides the gene|ral effect produced by the intervention of a third per&s;on, in a &s;ociety, the members of which are afraid to think of one another's thoughts.&mdash;Yet you need not an&s;wer this wi&s;h of mine; I know how impo&s;&s;ible it is for you to come hither at pre&s;ent. Write to me as often as you can; you will not ex|pect

order in my letters, nor ob&s;erve it in your an&s;wers; I will &s;peak to you on paper when my heart is full, and you will an&s;wer me from the &s;ympathy of yours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. JULIA TO MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>I AM to vex my MARIA with an account of trifles, and tho&s;e too, unplea&s;ant ones, but &s;he has taught me to think, that nothing is in&s;ignifi|cant to her, in which I am concerned, and in&s;i&s;ts on participating, at lea&s;t if &s;he cannot alleviate, my di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I am every day more and more unea&s;y about the chagrin which our &s;ituation &s;eems to give my fa|ther. A little incident has ju&s;t now plunged him into a fit of melancholy, which all the attention of my mother, all the attempts at gaiety which your poor JULIA is con&s;trained to make, cannot di&s;&s;ipate or overcome.</P>
<P>Our old &s;ervant Le Blanc is your acquaintance; indeed he very &s;oon becomes acquainted with e|very friend and vi&s;itor of the family, his age prompting him to talk, and giving him the pri|vilege of talking.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="017578_0013_0FBA6F63627359E8">
Le Blanc had obtained permi&s;&s;ion, a few days &s;ince, to go on a vi&s;it to his daughter, who is married to a young fellow, &s;erving in the capacity of coachman at a gentleman's in the neighbour|hood of <HI>Belville.</HI> He returned la&s;t night, and, in his u&s;ual familiar manner, gave us an account of his expedition this morning.</P>
<P>My father enquired after his daughter: He gave &s;ome &s;hort an&s;wer as to her; but I &s;aw by his face that he was full of &s;ome other intelli|gence. He was &s;tanding behind my father, re&s;t|ing one hand on the back of his chair; he began to rubit violently, as if he would have given the wood a poli&s;h by the friction. "I was at <HI>Belville,</HI> Sir," &s;aid he. My father made no reply; but Le Blanc had got over the difficulty of beginning, and was too much occupied by the idea of the &s;cene, to forbear attempting the picture.</P>
<P>"When I &s;truck off the high road, &s;aid he, to go down by the Old Avenue, I thought I had lo&s;t my way; there was not a tree to be &s;een. You may believe me as you plea&s;e, Sir; but, I declare, I &s;aw the rooks that u&s;ed to build there, in a great flock over my head, croaking for all the world as if they had been looking for the A|venue too. Old La&s;une's hou&s;e where you, Mi&s;s, (turning to me) would frequently &s;top in your
<PB N="7" REF="017578_0014_0FBA6F689E7107A0">
walks, was pulled down, except a &s;ingle beam at one end, which now &s;erves for a rubbing-po&s;t to &s;ome cattle that graze there; and your roan hor&s;e, Sir, which the Marquis had of you in a pre&s;ent, when he purcha&s;ed <HI>Belville,</HI> has been turned out to gra&s;s among the re&s;t, it &s;eems; for there he was, &s;tanding under the &s;hade of the wall; and when I came up, the poor bea&s;t knew me, as a|ny chri&s;tian would, and came neighing up to my &s;ide as he was wont to do. I gave him a piece of bread I had put in my pocket in the morning, and he followed me for more, till I reached the very gate of the hou&s;e; I mean what was the gate, when I knew it; for there is now a rail run acro&s;s, with a &s;mall door, which Le Sauvre told me they call Chine&s;e. But after all, the Marquis is &s;el|dom there to enjoy tho&s;e fine things; he lives in town, Le Sauvre &s;ays, eleven months in the year, and only comes down to <HI>Belville,</HI> for a few weeks to get money to &s;pend in Paris."</P>
<P>Here Le Blanc pau&s;ed in his narration. I was afraid to look up to &s;ee its effect on my father; indeed the picture which the poor fellow had, in|nocently, drawn, had too much affected my&s;elf.&mdash;La&s;une's hou&s;e!&mdash;My MARIA remembers it; but &s;he knows not all the ties which its recollection has upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017578_0015_0FBA6F6A3A097F88">
I &s;tole however a &s;ide-long glance at my father. He &s;eemed affected, but di&s;dain was mixed with his tenderne&s;s; he gathered up his features, as it were, to hide the effect of the recital. "You &s;aw Le Sauvre then?" &s;aid he coolly.&mdash;"Yes," an&s;wered Le Blanc; but he is wonderfully al|tered &s;ince he was in your &s;ervice, Sir; when I fir&s;t di&s;covered him, he was in the garden picking &s;ome greens for his dinner; he looked &s;o rueful when he lifted up his head and &s;aw me! indeed I was little better my&s;elf, when I ca&s;t my eyes a|round. It was a &s;ad &s;ight to &s;ee! for the Marquis keeps no gardener, except Le Sauvre him&s;elf, who has fifty things to do be&s;ides, and only hires another hand or two, for the time he re&s;ides at <HI>Belville</HI> in the &s;ummer. The walks that u&s;ed to be trimmed &s;o nicely, are covered with mole-hills; the hedges are full of great holes and Le Sauvre's chickens were ba&s;king in the flower-beds. He took me into the hou&s;e, and his wife &s;eemed glad to &s;ee her old acquaintance, and the children clambered up to ki&s;s me, and Jeanot a&s;ked me a|bout his god-mother, meaning you, Madam, and his little &s;i&s;ter enquired after her hand&s;ome mi|&s;tre&s;s, as &s;he u&s;ed to call you, Mi&s;s. "I have got, &s;aid Nanette, two new mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, that are finer dre&s;&s;ed than &s;he, but they are much prouder and not half &s;o pretty;" meaning two of the
<PB N="9" REF="017578_0016_0FBA6F6BACF43590">
Marquis's daughters, who were at <HI>Belville</HI> for a few days, when their father was la&s;t there. I &s;miled to hear the girl talk &s;o, though Heaven knows my heart was &s;ad. Only three of the rooms are furni&s;hed, in one of which Le Sauvre and his family were &s;itting; the re&s;t had their windows darkened with cobwebs, and they e|choed &s;o when Le Sauvre and I walked through them, that I &s;huddered, as if I had been in a monument.</P>
<P>"It is enough, Le Blanc," &s;aid my mother, in a &s;ort of a whi&s;per. My father a&s;ked &s;ome in|different que&s;tion about the weather. I &s;at, I know not how, looking piteou&s;ly, I &s;uppo&s;e; for my mother tapped my cheek with the word Child; emphatically pronounced. I &s;tarted out of my reverie, and finding my&s;elf unable to feign a compo&s;ure which I did not feel, walked out of the room to hide my emotion. When I got to my own chamber, I felt the full force of Le-Blanc's de&s;cription, but to me it was not pain|ful; it is not on hearts that yield the &s;oone&s;t that &s;orrow has the mo&s;t powerful effects; it was but giving way to a &s;hower of tears, and I could think of <HI>Belville</HI> with plea&s;ure, even in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of another.&mdash;They may cut its trees, MARIA, and alter its walks, but cannot &s;o de|face it as to leave no traces for the memory of
<PB N="10" REF="017578_0017_0FBA6F6D270C23B8">
your JULIA!&mdash;Methinks I &s;hould hate to have been born in a town; when I &s;ay my native brook or my native hill, I talk of friends of whom the rememberance warms my heart. To me, even to me, who have lo&s;t their acquaint|ance, there is &s;omething delightful in the melan|choly recollection of their beauties; and, here, I often wander out to the top of a little broom-covered knoll, merely to look towards the quar|ter where <HI>Bellville</HI> is &s;ituated.</P>
<P>It is otherwi&s;e with my father. On Le Blanc's recital he has brooded the&s;e three days. The ef|fect it had on him is &s;till vi&s;ible in his counte|nance, and but an hour ago, while my mother and I were talking of &s;ome other &s;ubject, in which he was joining by mono&s;yllables, he &s;aid, all at once, that he had &s;ome thoughts of &s;ending to the Marquis for his roan hor&s;e again, &s;ince he did not chu&s;e to keep him properly.</P>
<P>They who have never known pro&s;perity, can hardly be &s;aid to be unhappy; it is from the re|memberance of joys we have lo&s;t, that the arrows of affliction are pointed. Mu&s;t we then tremble, my friend, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of pre&s;ent plea&s;ures, from the fear of their embittering futurity? Or does Heaven thus teach us that &s;ort of enjoyment, of which the rememberance is immortal? Does it

point out tho&s;e as the happy, who can look back on their pa&s;t life, not as the chronicle of plea&s;ure, but as the record of virtue?</P>

<P>Is it a want of duty in me to mention the weak|ne&s;s of a parent; Heaven knows the &s;incerity of the love I bear him!

"But I have heard him &s;ay, mamma, that in the&s;e little hard&s;hips, a man thinks him|&s;elf unfortunate, but is never unhappy; and you may remember he would always prefer riding to being drove in a carriage, becau&s;e of the enjoy|ment which he told us he &s;hould feel from a clean room and a cheering fire when he got home." At the word Carriage, I could ob&s;erve my mother &s;igh; I was &s;orry it had e&s;caped me; but, at the end of my &s;peech, we looked both of us at the hearth, which I had &s;wept but the moment be|fore; the faggots were crackling in the fire, and my little Fidele lay a&s;leep before it.&mdash;He prick|ed up his ears and barked, and we heard the
<PB N="13" REF="017578_0020_0FBA6F740554EDE0">
trampling of hor&s;es in the court. Your father is returned, cried my mother; and I ran to the door to receive him. "JULIA, is it not?" &s;aid he (for the &s;ervant had not time to fetch us a light) but he &s;aid it coldly. I offered to help him off with his &s;urtout. "Softly, child, &s;aid he, you pull my arm awry." It was a trifle, but I felt my heart &s;well when he &s;aid this.</P>
<P>He entered the room; my mother took his hand in hers, "You are terribly cold, my love." &s;aid &s;he, and &s;he drew his chair nearer to the fire; he threw a&s;ide his hat and whip, without &s;peaking a word. In the centre of the table, which was covered for &s;upper, I had placed a bowl of milk, dre&s;&s;ed in a way I knew he liked, and had garni&s;hed it with &s;ome artificial flowers, in the manner we u&s;ed to have our de&s;&s;erts done at <HI>Belville.</HI> He fixed his eyes on it, and I began to make ready my an&s;wer to a que&s;tion I &s;uppo&s;ed he would a&s;k, who had trimmed it &s;o nicely? But he &s;tarted ha&s;tily from his chair, and &s;natching up this little piece of ornament, threw it into the fire, &s;aying, "we had now no title to finery." This was too much for me; it was fooli&s;h, very fooli&s;h, but I could not help letting fall &s;ome tears. He looked &s;ternly at me, and, muttering &s;ome words which I could not hear, walked out of the room, and &s;lapped the door roughly be|hind

him. I threw my&s;elf on my mother's neck, and wept outright.</P>
<P>Our &s;upper was &s;ilent and &s;ullen; to me the more painful, from the mortifying rever&s;e which I felt from what I had expected. My fa|ther did not ta&s;te the milk; my mother a&s;ked him to eat of it with an affected ea&s;e in her manner; but I ob&s;erved her voice faulter as &s;he a&s;ked him: As for me, I dur&s;t not look him in the face; I trembled every time the &s;ervant left the room; there was a protection, even in his pre&s;ence, which I could not bear to lo&s;e. The table was &s;carcely uncovered, when my father &s;aid he was tired and &s;leepy; my mother laid hold of the op|portunity, and offered to accompany him to their chamber: She bid me good night; my father was &s;ilent; but I an&s;wered as if addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to both.</P>
<P>MARIA! in my hours of vi&s;ionary indulgence, I have &s;ometimes painted to my&s;elf a hu&s;band&mdash;no matter whom&mdash;comforting me amid&s;t the di|&s;tre&s;&s;es which fortune had laid upon us. I have &s;miled upon him through my tears; tears, not of angui&s;h, but of tenderne&s;s;&mdash;our children were playing around us, uncon&s;cious of misfor|tune; we had taught them to be humble and to be happy;&mdash;our little &s;hed was re&s;erved to us,

and their &s;miles to cheer it.&mdash;I have imagined the luxury of &s;uch a &s;cene, and affliction became a part of my dream of happine&s;s!</P>
<P>Thus far I had written la&s;t night; I found at la&s;t my body tired and drowzy, though my mind was ill di&s;po&s;ed to obey it: I laid a&s;ide my pen, and thought of going to bed; but I continued &s;itting in my chair, for an hour after, in that &s;tate of languid thinking, which, though it has not &s;trength enough to fa&s;ten on any &s;ingle object, can wander without wearine&s;s over a thou&s;and. The clock &s;triking one, di&s;&s;olved the enchantment; I was then with my MARIA, and I went to bed but to continue my dream of her.</P>
<P>Why did I wake to anxiety and di&s;quiet?&mdash;Sel|fi&s;h! that I &s;hould not bear without murmuring, my proportion of both!&mdash;I met my mother in the parlour, with a &s;mile of meekne&s;s, and &s;erenity on her countenance; &s;he did not &s;ay a &s;ingle word of la&s;t night's incident; and I &s;aw &s;he purpo&s;ely avoided giving me any opportunity of mentioning it; &s;uch is the delicacy of her conduct with re|gard to my father. What an angel this woman is! Yet I fear, my friend, &s;he is a very woman in her &s;ufferings.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="017578_0023_0FBA6F7AA330BA60">
She was the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;peaker of our company, while my father &s;at with us. He rode out &s;oon after breakfa&s;t, and did not return till dinner|time. I was almo&s;t afraid of his return, and was happy to &s;ee, from my window, &s;omebody riding down the lane along with him. This was a gentleman of con&s;iderable rank and fortune in our neighbourhood, the Count Louis de Montau|ban. I do not know how it has happened, but I cannot recollect having ever mentioned him to you before. He is not one of tho&s;e very in|tere&s;ting characters, which are long pre&s;ent with the mind; yet his worth is univer&s;ally acknow|ledged, and his friend&s;hip to my father, though of late acqui&s;ition, de&s;erves more than ordinary acknowledgment from us. His hi&s;tory we heard from others, &s;oon after our arrival here; &s;ince our acquaintance began, we have had it, at dif|ferent times from him&s;elf; for though he has not much frankne&s;s about him to di&s;cover his &s;ecrets, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a manly firmne&s;s, which does not &s;hrink from the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>His father was only brother to the late Francis Count de Montauban; his mother, the daughter of a noble family in <HI>Spain,</HI> died in child-bed of him, and he was &s;oon after deprived of his re|maining parent, who was killed at a &s;iege in <HI>Flan|ders.</HI> His uncle took, for &s;ome time, the charge
<PB N="17" REF="017578_0024_0FBA70D3A79721C0">
of his education; but, before he attained the age of manhood, he di&s;covered, in the Count's behaviour, a want of that re&s;pect which &s;hould have di&s;tingui&s;hed the relation from the depen|dent; and after having, in vain, endeavoured to a&s;&s;ert it, he took the re&s;olution of leaving <HI>France,</HI> and travelled a-foot into <HI>Spain,</HI> where he met with a very kind reception from the relations of his mother. By their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was afterwards enabled to acquire a re&s;pectable rank in the Spa|ni&s;h army, and &s;erved, in a &s;eries of campaigns, with di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation. About a year ago, his uncle died unmarried; by this event he &s;uc|ceeded to the family e&s;tate, part of which is &s;itu|ated in this neighbourhood; and &s;ince that time, he has been generally here, employed in &s;uperin|tending it; for which, it &s;eems, there was the greater nece&s;&s;ity, as the late Count who common|ly lived at the old hereditary &s;eat of his ance&s;tors, had, for &s;ome of the la&s;t years of his life, been en|tirely under the dominion of rapacious dome&s;tics, and &s;uffered his affairs in this quarter, to run, un|der their guidance, into the greate&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Though, in <HI>France,</HI> a man of fortune's re&s;idence at his country-&s;eat is &s;o unu&s;ual, that it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to enhance the value of &s;uch a neigh|bour, yet the circum&s;tance of Montauban's great fortune was a rea&s;on, I believe, for my father's
<PB N="18" REF="017578_0025_0FBA70D544DB3D88">
&s;hunning any advances towards his acquaintance. The Count at la&s;t contrived to introduce him&s;elf to us (which, for what rea&s;on I know not, he &s;eem|ed extremely anxious to do) in a manner that flat|tered my father; not by offering favours, but by a&s;king one. He had led a walk through a particu|lar part of his ground, along the cour&s;e of a brook, which runs al&s;o through a narrow neck of my father's property, by the intervention of which the Count's territory was divided. This &s;trip of my father's ground would have been a purcha&s;e very convenient for Montauban; but, with that peculiar delicacy which our &s;ituation re|quired, he never made the propo&s;ition of a pur|cha&s;e, but only reque&s;ted that he might have leave to open a pa&s;&s;age through an old wall, by which it was inclo&s;ed, that he might enjoy a continuation of that romantic path, which the banks of the ri|vulet afforded. His de&s;ire was expre&s;&s;ed &s;o polite|ly, that it could not be refu&s;ed. Montauban &s;oon after paid a vi&s;it of thanks to my father, on the occa&s;ion; this la&s;t was plea&s;ed with an incident, which gave him back the power of conferring an obligation, and therefore, I pre&s;ume, looked on his new acquaintance with a favourable eye; he prai&s;ed his appearance, to my mother and me; and &s;ince that day, they have improved their ac|quaintance into a very cordial intimacy.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="017578_0026_0FBA70DAA2696320">
In many re&s;pects, indeed, their &s;entiments are congenial. A high &s;en&s;e of honour is equally the portion of both. Montauban, from his long &s;er|vice in the army, and his long re&s;idence in <HI>Spain,</HI> carries it to a very romantic height. My father, from a &s;en&s;e of his &s;ituation, is now more jealous than ever of his. Montauban &s;eems of a melan|choly di&s;po&s;ition. My father was far from being &s;o once; but misfortune has now given his mind a tincture of &s;adne&s;s. Montauban thinks lightly of the world, from principle. My father, from ill-u&s;age, holds it in di&s;gu&s;t. This la&s;t &s;imilarity of &s;entiment is a favourite topic of their di&s;cour&s;e, and their friend&s;hip &s;eems to increa&s;e, from every mutual ob&s;ervation which they make. Perhaps it is from &s;omething ami&s;s in our nature, but I have often ob&s;erved the mo&s;t &s;trict of our attachments to proceed from an alliance of di&s;like.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething hard and unbending in the character of the Count, which, though my father applauds it under the title of magnanimity, I own my&s;elf womani&s;h enough not to like. There is a yielding weakne&s;s, which to me is more ami|able than the inflexible right; it is an act of my rea&s;on to approve of the la&s;t; but my heart gives its &s;uffrage to the fir&s;t, without pau&s;ing to inquire for a cau&s;e.&mdash;I am aukward at defining; you
<PB N="20" REF="017578_0027_0FBA70DCACA81930">
know what I mean; the la&s;t is &s;tern in Montauban, the fir&s;t is &s;miling in MARIA.</P>
<P>Mean time, I wi&s;h to feel the mo&s;t perfect gra|titude for his unwearied a&s;&s;iduities to oblige my father and his family. When I think on his un|common friend&s;hip, I try to forget that &s;everity, which holds me &s;omehow at a di&s;tance from him.</P>
<P>Though I meant a de&s;cription, I have &s;crawled through mo&s;t of my paper without beginning one. I have made but &s;ome &s;light &s;ketches of his mind; of his per&s;on I have &s;aid nothing; which, from a woman to a woman, &s;hould have been mentioned the &s;oone&s;t. It is &s;uch as becomes a &s;oldier, ra|ther manly than hand&s;ome, with an air of dignity in his mien that borders on haughtine&s;s. In &s;hort, were I to &s;tudy for a &s;entence, I &s;hould &s;ay, that Montauban was made to command re&s;pect from all, to obtain prai&s;e from mo&s;t, but to engage the affections of few.</P>
<P>His company to-day was of importance to us. By our&s;elves, every one's look &s;eemed the &s;py on another's. We were con&s;cious of remembering what all affected to forget. Montauban's conver|&s;ation reconciled us, without our being &s;en&s;ible of it.</P>
<P>My father, who (as it commonly happens to the aggre&s;&s;or in tho&s;e ca&s;es) had perhaps felt more from
<PB N="21" REF="017578_0028_0FBA70DE70AE2498">
his own har&s;hne&s;s, than either my mother or I, &s;eemed happy to find an opportunity of being re|&s;tored to his former familiarity. He was gayer, and more in &s;pirits, than I have &s;een him for a long time pa&s;t. He in&s;i&s;ted on the Count's &s;pend|ing the evening with us. Montauban at fir&s;t ex|cu&s;ed him&s;elf. He had told us, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, of his having appropriated the evening to bu&s;ine&s;s at home; but my father would li&s;ten to no apology, and the other was at la&s;t overcome. He &s;eems, indeed, to feel an uncommon attachment to my father, and to enjoy more plea|&s;ure in his company, than I &s;hould have expected him to find in the &s;ociety of any one.</P>
<P>You are now, in the account of corre&s;pondence, I do not know how deep, in my debt. I mean not to a&s;k regular returns; but write to me, I en|treat you, when you can; and write larger letters than your la&s;t. Put down every thing, &s;o it be what you feel at the time; and tell every incident that can make me pre&s;ent with you, were it but the making up of a cap that plea&s;es you.

<HEAD>LETTER IV. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</HEAD>
<P>YOU &s;aw, my friend, with what reluctance I left <HI>Spain,</HI> though it was to return to the country of my birth, to the inheritance of my fathers. I trembled when I thought what a &s;cene of confu&s;ion the &s;trange mi&s;management of my uncle had left me to di&s;entangle; but it required only a certain degree of fortitude to begin that bu&s;ine&s;s, and it was much &s;ooner concluded than I looked for. I have now almo&s;t wrought my&s;elf out of work, and yet the &s;ituation is not &s;o di&s;|gu&s;ting as I imagined. I have long learned to de|&s;pi&s;e that flippancy, which characteri&s;es my coun|trymen; yet, I know not how it is, they gain upon me in &s;pite of my&s;elf; and while I re&s;olve to cen&s;ure, I am forced to &s;mile.</P>
<P>From <HI>Paris,</HI> however, I fled, as if it had been infe&s;ted with a pe&s;tilence. Great towns certainly contain many excellent per&s;ons; but vice and folly predominate &s;o much, that a &s;earch after their oppo&s;ites is beyond the limits of ordinary en|durance; and, be&s;ides the &s;uperiority of num|bers, the fir&s;t are ever perked up to view, while the latter are &s;olicitous to avoid ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="017578_0030_0FBA70E569E15FE0">
In the country I found a different &s;tyle of cha|racter. Here are impertinents who talk non&s;en&s;e, and rogues who cheat where they can; but they are &s;omewhat nearer nature in both. I met with &s;ome female relations, who &s;tunned me with re|ceipts in cookery, and pre&s;criptions in phy&s;ic; but they did not dictate to my ta&s;te in letters, or my judgment in philo&s;ophy. Ignorance I can bear without emotion; but the affectation of learning gives me a fit of the &s;pleen. I make indeed but an aukward figure among them; for I am forced, by repre&s;enting my uncle, to &s;ee a number of our family friends, whom I never heard of. The&s;e good people, however, bear with me wonderfully, and I am not laughed at, as you predicted.</P>
<P>But they &s;ometimes pe&s;ter me with their civi|lities. It is their principle, that a man cannot be happy alone; and they tire me with their com|pany, out of pure good nature. I have endea|voured to undeceive them: The greater part do not under&s;tand my hints; tho&s;e who do, repre&s;ent me a &s;our ungracious being, whom <HI>Spain</HI> has taught pride and &s;ullenne&s;s. This is well, and I hope the opinion will propagate it&s;elf apace. One mu&s;t be &s;omewhat hated, to be independent of folly.</P>
<P>There is but one of my neighbours, who&s;e tem|per I find at all congenial to my own. He has
<PB N="24" REF="017578_0031_0FBA70E5B784CC90">
been taught by misfortune to be &s;erious: For that I love him; but misfortune has not taught him to be humble: For this I love him the more. There is a pride which becomes every man; a poor man, of all others, &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s it.</P>
<P>His name is Pierre de Roubign&eacute;: His family of that rank, which is perhaps always nece&s;&s;ary to give a fixed liberality of &s;entiment. From the con&s;equences of an unfortunate law-&s;uit, his circum&s;tances became &s;o involved, that he was obliged to &s;ell his paternal e&s;tate, and retire to a &s;mall purcha&s;e he had made in this province, which is &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of my territories here. My &s;teward pointed it out to me, as a thing it was proper for me to be ma&s;ter of, and hinted, that its owner's circum&s;tances were &s;uch as might induce him to part with it. Such is the language of tho&s;e devourers of land, who wi&s;h to make a wilderne&s;s around them, provided they are lords of it. For my part, I find much le&s;s plea&s;ure in being the ma&s;ter of acres, than the friend of men.</P>
<P>From the particulars of Mon&s;. de Roubign&eacute;'s &s;tory which I learned &s;oon after I came hither, I was extremely &s;olicitous of his acquaintance; but I found it not ea&s;y to accompli&s;h my de&s;ire, the di&s;tance which great minds pre&s;erve in adver|&s;ity, keeping him &s;ecluded from the world. By
<PB N="25" REF="017578_0032_0FBA70E7A86EF3C0">
humouring that delicacy, which ruled him in his acceptance of a new acquaintance, I have at la&s;t &s;ucceeded. He admits me as his gue&s;t, without the ceremony which the little folks around us oblige me to endure from them. He does not think him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of eternally talking to entertain me; and we &s;ometimes &s;pend a morning together, plea&s;ed with each other's &s;ociety, though we do not utter a dozen &s;entences.</P>
<P>His youth has been enlightened by letters, and informed by travel; but what is &s;till more valu|able, his mind has been early impre&s;&s;ed with the principles of manly virtue: He is liberal in &s;en|timent, but rigid in the feelings of honour.</P>
<P>Were I to mark his failings, I might ob&s;erve a degree of peevi&s;hne&s;s at mankind, which, though mankind may de&s;erve, it is the true&s;t indepen|dence not to allow them. He feels that chagrin at his &s;ituation, which con&s;titutes the victory of mis|fortune over us&mdash;but I have not known misfor|tune, and am therefore not entitled to ob&s;erve it. His family con&s;i&s;ts of a wife and daughter, his only &s;urviving child, who are equally e&s;timable with him&s;elf. I have not, at pre&s;ent, time to de|&s;cribe them. I have given you this &s;ketch of him, becau&s;e I think he is &s;uch a man as might be the friend of my Segarva. There are &s;o few in this trifling world, who&s;e mutual excellence de&s;erves
<PB N="26" REF="017578_0033_0FBA70EE4C6E7EC0">
mutual e&s;teem, that the intervention of an hun|dred leagues &s;hould not bar their acquaintance; and we increa&s;e the &s;en&s;e of virtue in our&s;elves, by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of virtue in others.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</HEAD>
<P>I DESCRIBED to you, in my la&s;t, the fa|ther of that family, who&s;e acquaintance I have chiefly cultivated &s;ince I came hither. His wife and daughter I promi&s;ed to de&s;cribe&mdash;at lea&s;t &s;uch a promi&s;e was implied&mdash;perhaps I find plea&s;ure in de&s;cribing them&mdash;I have time enough at lea&s;t for the de&s;cription&mdash;but no matter for the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>MADAME DE ROUBIGN&Eacute; has &s;till the remains of a very fine woman; and, if I may credit a picture in her hu&s;band's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was in her youth re|markably hand&s;ome. She has now a &s;ort of &s;till|ne&s;s in her look, which &s;eems the effect of re&s;ig|nation in adver&s;ity. Her countenance bears the marks of &s;orrow which we do not &s;o much pity as revere; &s;he has yielded to calamity, while her
<PB N="27" REF="017578_0034_0FBA70EF7908E038">
hu&s;band has &s;truggled under its pre&s;&s;ure, and hence has acquired a compo&s;ure, which renders that unea&s;ine&s;s I remarked in him more ob&s;erv|able by the contra&s;t. I have been informed of one particular, which, be&s;ides the difference of &s;ex, may, in a great mea&s;ure, account for this. She brought Roubign&eacute; a very con&s;iderable fortune, the greate&s;t part of which was &s;pent in that un|fortunate law-&s;uit I mentioned. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this makes the hu&s;band impatient under their pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, from the very principle of genero&s;ity, which leads the wife to appear con|tented.</P>
<P>In her conver&s;ation &s;he is guided by the &s;ame evenne&s;s of temper. She talks of the world as of a &s;cene where &s;he is a &s;pectator merely, in which there is &s;omething for virtue to prai&s;e, for charity to pardon; and &s;mooths the &s;pleen of her hu&s;|band's ob&s;ervations by &s;ome palliative remark which experience has taught her.</P>
<P>One con&s;olation &s;he has ever at hand: <HI>Religion,</HI> the friend of calamity, &s;he had cultivated in her mo&s;t pro&s;perous days. Affliction, however, has not driven her to enthu&s;ia&s;m; her feelings of de|votion are mild and &s;ecret, her expre&s;&s;ion gentle and charitable. I have always ob&s;erved your out|rageou&s;ly-religious, amid&s;t their &s;everity to their
<PB N="28" REF="017578_0035_0FBA70F028BEE498">
neighbours, manife&s;t a di&s;content with them|&s;elves; &s;pirits like MADAME DE ROUBIGN&Eacute;'s have that inward peace which is ea&s;ily &s;atisfied with others. The rapturous blaze of devotion is more allied to vanity than to happine&s;s; like the torches of the great it di&s;tre&s;&s;es its owner, while it flames in the eye of the public; the other, like the ru&s;h-light of the cottager, cheers the little fa|mily within, while it &s;eeks not to be &s;een of the world.</P>
<P>But her daughter, her lovely daughter!&mdash;with all the gentlene&s;s of her mother's di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he unites the warmth of her father's heart, and the &s;trength of her father's under&s;tanding. Her eyes in their &s;ilent &s;tate (if I may u&s;e the term) give the beholder every idea of feminine &s;oftne&s;s; when &s;entiment or feeling animates them, how eloquent they are! When Roubign&eacute; talks, I hate vice, and de&s;pi&s;e folly; when his wife &s;peaks, I pity both; but the mu&s;ic of JULIA's tongue gives the throb of virtue to my heart, and lifts my &s;oul to &s;omewhat &s;uperhuman.</P>
<P>I mention not the graces of her form; yet they are &s;uch as would attract the admiration of tho&s;e, by whom the beauties of her mind might not be under&s;tood. In one as well as the other, there
<PB N="29" REF="017578_0036_0FBA70F1A4A7E940">

<P>To the flippancy, which we are apt to a&s;cribe to females of her age, &s;he &s;eems utterly a &s;tran|ger. Her di&s;po&s;ition indeed appears to lean, in an uncommon degree, towards the &s;erious. Yet &s;he breaks forth at times into filial attempts at gaiety, to amu&s;e that di&s;quiet which &s;he ob&s;erves in her father; but even then it looks like a con|que&s;t over the natural pen&s;ivene&s;s of her mind. This melancholy might be held a fault in JULIA; but the fortune of her family has been &s;uch, that none but tho&s;e, who are totally exempted from thinking, could have looked on it with indiffe|rence.</P>
<P>It is only indeed, when &s;he would confer hap|pine&s;s on others, that &s;he &s;eems perfectly to enjoy it. The ru&s;tics around us talk of her affability and good humour with the livelie&s;t gratitude; and I have been witne&s;s to &s;everal &s;cenes, where &s;he di&s;pen&s;ed mirth and gaiety to &s;ome poor fa|milies in our neighbourhood, with a countenance as cheerful as the mo&s;t unthinking of them all.

<P>I am called from my de&s;cription by the ap|proach of her whom I would de&s;cribe.

<P>YOU rally me on the &s;ubject of the Count de Montauban, with that vivacity which I have &s;o often envied you the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. You &s;ay, you are &s;ure, you &s;hould like him va&s;tly. "What a ble&s;&s;ing, in a remote province, where one is in danger of dying of <HI>ennui,</HI> to have this &s;tiff, cru&s;ty, honourable Spaniard, to tea&s;e and make a fool of!"

He can talk of common things in a common way; and but ye&s;terday he danced with me on the green, amid&s;t a troop of hone&s;t ru&s;tics, whom I wi&s;hed to make happy at the &s;mall expence of &s;haring their happine&s;s. All this, I allow, at fir&s;t, &s;eemed foreign to the man; but he did not, as I have &s;een &s;ome of your wi&s;e people do, take great credit for letting him&s;elf down &s;o low. He did it with a de&s;ign of frank|ne&s;s, though &s;ome of his native loftine&s;s remained in the execution.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="017578_0039_0FBA70F9EFDF8610">
We are much in his debt on the &s;core of do|me&s;tic happine&s;s. He has become &s;o far one of the family as to be welcome at all times, a privi|lege he makes very frequent u&s;e of; and we find our&s;elves &s;o much at ea&s;e with him, that we never think even of talking more than we chu&s;e, to en|tertain him. He will &s;it for an hour at the table where I am working, with no other amu&s;ement than that of twi&s;ting &s;hreds of my catgut into whim&s;ical figures.</P>
<P>I think that he al&s;o is not the wor&s;e for our &s;o|ciety: I &s;uppo&s;e him the happier for it, from the change in his &s;entiments of others. He often di&s;|putes with my father, and will not allow the world to be altogether &s;o bad as he u&s;ed to do. My fa|ther, who can now be merry at times, jokes him on his apo&s;tacy. He appealed to me this morning for the truth of his argument. I told him, I was unable to judge, becau&s;e I knew nothing of the world. "And yet, (replied he gallantly) it is from you one &s;hould learn to think better of it: I never knew, till I came hither, that it contained any thing &s;o valuable as MADEMOISELLE DE ROUBIGN&Eacute;." I think, he looked fooli&s;h when be paid me this compliment. I curt&s;ied, with compo&s;ure enough. It is not from men like Montauban that one blu&s;hes at a compliment.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="017578_0040_0FBA70FE9F151F70">
Be&s;ides the general addition to our good-hu|mour, his &s;ociety is particularly u&s;eful to me. His di&s;cour&s;e frequently turns on &s;ubjects, from the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of which, though I am &s;omewhat afraid to engage in it, I always find my&s;elf the wi&s;er. Amid&s;t the toils of his military life, Montauban has contrived to find lei&s;ure for the pur&s;uit of every exten&s;ive and u&s;eful knowledge. This, though little &s;olicitous to di&s;play, he is always ready to communicate; and, as he finds me willing to be in&s;tructed, he &s;eems to find a plea|&s;ure in in&s;tructing me.</P>
<P>My mother takes every opportunity of encou|raging this &s;ort of conver&s;ation. You have often heard her &s;entiments on the mutual advantage of &s;uch intercour&s;e between the &s;exes. You well re|member her frequent mention of a male friend, who died &s;oon after her marriage, from whom, &s;he has told us, &s;he derived mo&s;t of the little ac|compli&s;hment her mind can boa&s;t of. "Men (&s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay) though they talk much of their friends, are &s;eldom ble&s;t with a friend. The na|ture of that companion&s;hip, which they mi&s;take for friend&s;hip, is really de&s;tructive of its exi&s;tence; becau&s;e the delicacy of the la&s;t &s;hrinks from the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> touch of the former; and that, however pure in their own &s;entiments, the &s;ociety which they &s;ee each other hold with third per&s;ons, is too

gro&s;s, not to break tho&s;e tender links, which are ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to friend&s;hip. Girls (&s;he &s;aid) ea&s;ily form a connexion of a more refined &s;ort; but as it commonly begins with romance, it &s;el|dom outla&s;ts the years of childhood, except when it degenerates into cabal and intrigue; but that the friend&s;hip of one of each sex, when &s;o cir|cum&s;tanced as to be di&s;tant from love (which &s;he affirmed might be the ca&s;e) has that combination of &s;trength and delicacy which is equally formed to improve and delight."</P>
<P>There may be much rea&s;on in her arguments; but I cannot, notwith&s;tanding my e&s;teem for him, ea&s;ily think of Montauban as my friend. He has not yet quite obliterated the fears I felt on our fir&s;t acquaintance. He has, however, done much to conquer them; and, if he goes on as he has begun, I know not what in time he may arrive at. Mean time I am contented with MARIA: Our friend|&s;hip has at lea&s;t endured beyond the period a&s;&s;ign|ed by my mother. Shall it not always endure?

<P>YOU complain of my &s;ilence. In truth I have nothing to &s;ay but to repeat, what is very unnece&s;&s;ary, my a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip to Segarva. My life is of a &s;ort that produces no|thing, I mean in recital.

<P>If the word &s;ociety is confined to our own &s;pe|cies, I enjoy very little of it. I &s;hould except that of the family I gave you an account of &s;ome time ago.

<P>I blu&s;h to tell you what a fool I am grown; or is it that I am nearer the truth than formerly? I begin to entertain doubts of my own dignity, and to think that man is not altogether formed for the &s;ublime place I u&s;ed to allot him. One can be very happy with much le&s;s trouble, than very

<P>After all, what is our boa&s;ted philo&s;ophy to our|&s;elves or others? Its con&s;equence is often borrow|ed, more from the language it &s;peaks, than the object it pur&s;ues, and its attainments valued, more from their difficulty, than their u&s;efulne&s;s. But life takes its complexion from inferior things; and Providence has wi&s;ely placed its real ble&s;&s;ings within the reach of moderate abilities. We look for a &s;tation beyond them; it is fit that we too &s;hould have our reward; and it is found in our va|nity.

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. JULIA TO MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>PITY me, MARIA, pity me! even that quiet which my letters of late de&s;cribed, which I was contented to call happine&s;s, is denied me. There is a fatality which every where attends the family of the unfortunate Roubign&eacute;; here, to the abodes of peace, perplexity pur&s;ues it; and it is de&s;tined to find new di&s;tre&s;s, from tho&s;e &s;can|ty &s;ources to which it looked for comfort.</P>
<P>The Count de Montauban&mdash;why did he &s;ee me? why did he vi&s;it here? why did I li&s;ten to his di&s;cour&s;e? though Heaven knows, I meant not to deceive him!&mdash;He has declared him&s;elf the lover of your JULIA!&mdash;I own his vir|tues, I e&s;teem his character, I know the gratitude too we owe him; from all tho&s;e circum&s;tances I am doubly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at my &s;ituation; but it is im|po&s;&s;ible, it is impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould love him.
<PB N="38" REF="017578_0045_0FBA71083068F5A8">
How could he imagine that I &s;hould? or how does he &s;till continue to imagine that I may be won to love him? I &s;oftened my refu&s;al, becau&s;e I would di&s;tre&s;s no man; Montauban of all men the lea&s;t; but &s;urely it was determined enough, to cut off all hopes of my ever altering my re|&s;olution.</P>
<P>Should not his pride teach him to cea&s;e &s;uch mortifying &s;olicitations? How has it, in this in|&s;tance alone, for&s;aken him? Methinks too, he has acted ungenerou&s;ly, in letting my mother know of his addre&s;&s;es. When I hinted this, he fell at my feet, and intreated me to forgive a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o earne&s;t as his, for calling in every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Cruel! that in this tendere&s;t concern, that &s;ex which is naturally feeble, &s;hould have other weakne&s;&s;es to combat be&s;ides its own.</P>
<P>I know my mother's gentlene&s;s too well to have much to fear from her; but the idea of my fa|ther's di&s;plea&s;ure is terrible. This morning, when I entreated my mother not to mention this matter to him, &s;he informed me of her having already told him. It was an affair, &s;he &s;aid, of &s;o much importance to his family, that &s;he dur&s;t not ven|ture to conceal it. There was &s;omething in the coolne&s;s of her words that hurt me; but I &s;tifled the an&s;wer which I was about to make, and only

ob&s;erved, that of that family I was the neare&s;t concerned. "You &s;hall judge for your&s;elf, my dear girl (&s;aid &s;he, re&s;uming the natural gentle|ne&s;s of her manner) I will never pretend to con|troul your affections. Your opinions I always hold it my duty to guide; experience, dearly bought perhaps, has given me &s;ome title to guide them. Believe me, there are dreams of roman|tic affection, which are apt to po&s;&s;e&s;s young minds, the reality of which is not to be found in nature. I do not blame you for doubting this at pre&s;ent; but the time will come when you &s;hall be con|vinced of its truth."</P>
<P>Is it &s;o, MARIA? Shall that period ever arrive, when my pre&s;ent feelings &s;hall be forgotten? But, if it &s;hould, are they not <HI>now</HI> my con&s;cience, and &s;hould I not be unju&s;t to Montauban and my&s;elf, were I <HI>now</HI> to act again&s;t them?</P>
<P>I have &s;een my father. He came into my room in his u&s;ual way, and a&s;ked me, if I cho&s;e to walk with him. His words were the &s;ame they were wont to be; but I could di&s;cover that his thoughts were different. He looked on me with a determined countenance, as if he prepared him|&s;elf for contradiction. I concealed my unea&s;ine&s;s, however, and attended him with that appearance

When he called me the &s;upport and &s;olace of his age; when he ble&s;&s;ed Heaven for leaving him, in the wor&s;t of his mis|fortunes, his JULIA to comfort him&mdash;why could I not then, amid&s;t my filial tears, when my heart &s;hould have poured it&s;elf out in duty and gratitude, why could I not then a&s;&s;ure him of its obedience?</P>
<P>Write to me for pity's &s;ake, write to me &s;pee|dily&mdash;A&s;&s;i&s;t me, coun&s;el me, guide me&mdash;But &s;ay not that I &s;hould li&s;ten to Montauban.</P>

<P>Let me tell him then of my pa&s;&s;ion for that lovelie&s;t of women; that it has prompted me to offer her a hand, which, he has &s;ometimes heard me declare, &s;hould never give away my freedom.

<P>To acquire &s;uch a friend as JULIA DE ROU|BIGN&Eacute;&mdash;but friend is a word in&s;ignificant of the connexion&mdash;to have one &s;oul, one fate with her! to participate her happine&s;s, to &s;hare her griefs! to be that &s;ingle Being to whom, the next to Divinity, &s;he pours out the feelings of her heart, to whom &s;he &s;peaks the gentle&s;t of her wi&s;hes, to whom &s;he &s;ighs the mo&s;t delicate of her fears! to grant tho&s;e wi&s;hes, to &s;ooth tho&s;e fears! to have &s;uch a woman (like our guardian-angel without his &s;uperiority) to whom we may unbo&s;om our own!&mdash;the creation of plea&s;ures is little; this is a creation of &s;oul to enjoy them!</P>
<P>Call not mine the language of doating love; I am confident how much rea&s;on is on my &s;ide, and will now hear Segarva with patience.</P>
<P>He will tell me of that fa&s;cinating power which women po&s;&s;e&s;s, when they would win us, which fades at once from the character of wife.&mdash;But I know JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute; well; &s;he has grown up under the eye of the be&s;t of parents, un&s;chooled in the practices of her &s;ex; &s;he is ig|norant

<P>He will remind me of the di&s;parity of age, and tell me of the danger of her affections wan|dering from one, whom, on compari&s;on with her|&s;elf, &s;he will learn to think an old man.&mdash;But JULIA is of an order of beings &s;uperior to tho&s;e whom external form, and the trifling language of gallantry, can attract. Had &s;he the flippancy of mind which tho&s;e &s;hallow qualities are able to al|lure, I think, Segarva, &s;he were beneath the e|lection of Montauban.</P>
<P>I remember our former conver&s;ations on the &s;ubject of marriage, when we were both of one &s;ide; and that, then, you ob&s;erved in me a cer|tain wakeful jealou&s;y of honour, which, you &s;aid, the &s;mile of a wife on another man would rou&s;e into di&s;quiet.&mdash;Perhaps I have been &s;ome times too ha&s;ty that way, in the &s;en&s;e of affronts from men; but the nicety of a &s;oldier's character, which mu&s;t ever be out of the reach of que&s;tion, may excu&s;e it.

<P>In &s;hort, I have canva&s;&s;ed all your objections, and, I think, I have an&s;wered them all. For|give me for &s;uppo&s;ing you to make them; and for|give me, when I tell you, that, while I did &s;o, methought I loved you le&s;s than I was wont to do.</P>
<P>But I am anticipating ble&s;&s;ings, which may ne|ver arrive; for the gentle&s;t of her &s;ex is yet cruel to Montauban. But, I tru&s;t, it is only the maiden coyne&s;s of a mind, naturally fearful.

<P>The character you have heard of the Count de Montauban is ju&s;t; it is perhaps even le&s;s than he merits; for his virtues are of that unbending kind, that does not ea&s;ily &s;toop to the opinion of the world; to which the world therefore is not pro|fu&s;e of its eulogium.

I have &s;ome-times ob|&s;erved this weakne&s;s in my father; but the pride that leads to virtue may be pardoned. He thinks of a man as his inferior, only that he may do him a kindne&s;s more freely. Savillon's family, in|deed, was not &s;o noble as his mind; my father warmly acknowledged the excellence of the la&s;t; but he had been taught, from earlie&s;t infancy, to con&s;ider a misfortune the want of the former.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="017578_0054_0FBA711CF2B85830">
After the death of old Savillon, my father's friend&s;hip and protection were transferred to his &s;on; the time he could &s;pare from &s;tudy, was com|monly &s;pent at <HI>Belville.</HI> He appeared to feel in his &s;ituation that dependence I mentioned; in mean &s;ouls, this produces &s;ervility; in liberal minds, it is the nur&s;e of honourable pride. There was a &s;ilent melancholy about Savillon, which di&s;dained the notice of &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers, and was never &s;atisfied with &s;uperficial acquire|ment. His endowments did not attract the eye of the world; but they fixed the e&s;teem and ad|miration of his friends. His friends indeed were few; and he &s;eemed not to wi&s;h them many.</P>
<P>To know &s;uch a man; to &s;ee his merit; to re|gret that yoke which Fortune had laid upon him&mdash;I am bewildered in &s;entiment again.&mdash;In truth, my &s;tory is the &s;tory of &s;entiment. I would tell you how I began to love Savillon; but the trifles, by which I now mark the progre&s;s of this attachment, are too little for de&s;cription.</P>
<P>We were frequently together, at that time of life when a boy and girl are not alarmed at being together. Savillon's &s;uperior attainments made him a &s;ort of ma&s;ter for your JULIA. He u&s;ed to teach me ideas; &s;ometimes he flattered me, by &s;aying that, in his turn, he learned from me.
<PB N="48" REF="017578_0055_0FBA71208CF3CBC0">
Our feelings were often equally di&s;gu&s;ted with many of the common notions of mankind, and we early began to form a league again&s;t them. We began with an alliance of argument; but the heart was always appealed to in the la&s;t re&s;ort.</P>
<P>The time at la&s;t came, when I began to fear &s;omething improper in our friend&s;hip; but the fears that &s;hould guard, betray us. They make pictures to our fancy, which the rea&s;on they call to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance cannot overcome. In my ram|bles through the woods at <HI>Belville,</HI> I have often turned into a different walk from that I fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to take, becau&s;e I &s;u&s;pected Savillon was there!&mdash;Alas! MARIA, an ideal Savillon at|tended me, more dangerous than the real.</P>
<P>But it was only from his ab&s;ence, I acquired a certain knowledge of my&s;elf. I remember, on the eve of his departure, we were walking in the garden; my father was with us. He had been commending &s;ome carnation &s;eeds, which he had ju&s;t received from an eminent flori&s;t at <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> Savillon was examining &s;ome of them, which my father had put into his hand; and &s;oon after, when we came to a &s;mall plot, which I u&s;ed to call my garden, he &s;owed a few of them in a par|ticular corner of it. I took little notice at the time; but not long after he was gone, the flowers
<PB N="49" REF="017578_0056_0FBA7121A54C4B48">
began to appear. You cannot ea&s;ily imagine the effect this trifling circum&s;tance had upon me. I u&s;ed to vi&s;it the &s;pot by &s;tealth, for a certain con|&s;cious feeling prevented my going openly thither, and watched the growth of tho&s;e carnations with the care of a parent for a darling child; and when they began to droop (I blu&s;h, MARIA, to tell it) I have often watered them with my tears.</P>
<P>Such is the account of my own feelings; but who &s;hall tell me tho&s;e of Savillon? I have &s;een him look &s;uch things!&mdash;but, alas! MARIA, our wi&s;hes are traitors, and give us fal&s;e intelli|gence. His &s;oul is too noble to pour it&s;elf out in tho&s;e trivial &s;peeches which the other &s;ex often addre&s;&s;es to ours. Savillon knows not the lan|guage of compliment; yet methinks from Savillon it would plea&s;e. May not a &s;en&s;e of his humble fortune prevent him from &s;peaking what he feels? When we were fir&s;t acquainted, JULIA DE ROU|BIGN&Eacute; was a name of &s;ome con&s;equence; fallen as &s;he now is, it is now her time to be haughty, and Savillon is too generous to think otherwi&s;e. In our mo&s;t exalted e&s;tate, my friend, we are not &s;o difficult to win, as we are &s;ometimes imagined to be: it unfortunately happens, that the be&s;t men think us the mo&s;t &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="017578_0057_0FBA7123AD897880">
I know I am partial to my own cau&s;e; yet I am &s;en&s;ible of all the impropriety with which my conduct is attended. My <HI>conduct,</HI> did I call it? It is not my <HI>conduct;</HI> I err but in <HI>thought.</HI> Yet, I fear, I &s;uffered the&s;e thoughts at fir&s;t without a|larm. They have grown up, unchecked, in my bo&s;om, and now I would controul them in vain. Should I know my&s;elf indifferent to Savillon, would not my pride &s;et me free? I &s;igh, and dare not &s;ay that it would.</P>
<P>But there is &s;omething tenderer and le&s;s tumul|tuous in that feeling with which I now remember him, than when his pre&s;ence u&s;ed to alarm me. Obliged to leave <HI>France,</HI> where Fortune had de|nied him an inheritance, he is gone to <HI>Martinique,</HI> on the invitation of an uncle, who has been &s;everal years &s;ettled in that i&s;land. When I think of the tract of ocean which &s;eparates us, my head grows dizzy as I think!&mdash;that this little heart &s;hould have its intere&s;ts extended &s;o far! that, on the o|ther &s;ide the Atlantic, there &s;hould exi&s;t a being, for whom it &s;wells with imaginary hope, and trembles, alas! much oftener trembles, with imaginary fear!</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;ituation, wonder not at my coldne&s;s to Montauban. I know not how it is; but, me|thinks, I e&s;teem him le&s;s than I did, from the pre|po&s;terous rea&s;on that he loves me when I would
<PB N="51" REF="017578_0058_0FBA712668D4FCD8">
not have him. I owe him gratitude in return, though I cannot give him love; but I involun|tarily refu&s;e him the fir&s;t, becau&s;e he a&s;ks the lat|ter, which I have not to be&s;tow!</P>
<P>Would that he had never &s;een your JULIA! I expect not a life of happine&s;s, but had looked for one of quiet. There is &s;omething in the idea even of peaceful &s;adne&s;s, which I could bear with|out repining; but I am not made for &s;truggling with perplexity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. JULIA TO MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>FROM your letters, MARIA, I always find comfort and &s;atisfaction: And never did one arrive more &s;ea&s;onably than the la&s;t. When the &s;oul is torn by contrary emotions, it is then we wi&s;h for a friend to reconcile us to our&s;elves: Such a friend am I ble&s;&s;ed with in you. Advice from my MARIA, is the language of wi&s;dom without its &s;everity; &s;he can feel what is due to nature, while &s;he &s;peaks what is required of pru|dence.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="017578_0059_0FBA7127A2DE9708">
I have ever thought as you do, "that it is not enough for a woman not to &s;werve from the duty of a wife; that to love another more than a hu&s;|band, is an adultery of the heart; and not to love a hu&s;band with undivided affection, is a vir|tual breach of the vow that unites us."</P>
<P>But I dare not own to my father the attachment from which the&s;e arguments are drawn. There is a &s;ternne&s;s in his idea of honour, from which I &s;hrink with affright. Images of vengeance and de&s;truction paint them&s;elves to my mind, when I think of his di&s;covering that weakne&s;s which I cannot hide from my&s;elf. Even before my mo|ther, as his wife, I tremble, and dare not di&s;|clo&s;e it.</P>
<P>How hard is the fate of your JULIA! Unhap|py from feelings which &s;he cheri&s;hed as harmle&s;s, which &s;till &s;he cannot think criminal, yet denied even the comfort of revealing, except to her MARIA, the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s! Amid&s;t the wreck of our family's fortunes, I &s;hared the com|mon calamity; mu&s;t I now be robbed of the little trea&s;ure I had &s;aved, &s;poiled of my peace of mind, and forbid the native freedom of my af|fections?</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="017578_0060_0FBA712E852C2C48">
I am called to dinner. One of our neighbours is below, a di&s;tant relation of Montauban, with his wife and daughter. Another &s;tranger, Li&s;ette &s;ays, is al&s;o there, a captain of a &s;hip, &s;he thinks, whom &s;he remembers having &s;een formerly at <HI>Belville.</HI> Mu&s;t I go then, and look unmeaning cheerfulne&s;s, and talk indifferent things, while my heart is torn with &s;ecret agitation? To feel di&s;tre&s;s, is painful; but to di&s;&s;emble it, is torture.</P>
<P>I have now time to think and power to expre&s;s my thoughts&mdash;It is midnight and the world is hu&s;hed around me! After the agitation of this day, I feel &s;omething &s;ilently &s;ad at my heart, that can pour it&s;elf out to my friend!</P>
<P>Savillon! cruel Savillon!&mdash;but I complain, as if it were fal&s;ehood to have forgotten her whom perhaps he never loved.</P>
<P>She too mu&s;t forget him&mdash;MARIA! he is the hu&s;band of another! That &s;ea-captain, who di|ned with my father to day, is ju&s;t returned from <HI>Martinique.</HI> With a beating heart I heard him que&s;tioned of Savillon. With a beating heart I heard him tell of the riches he is &s;aid to have ac|quired by the death of that relation with whom he lived; but judge of its &s;en&s;ations, when he
<PB N="54" REF="017578_0061_0FBA7130096AC058">
added, that Savillon was only prevented by that event, from marrying the daughter of a rich planter, who had been de&s;tined for his wife on the very day his uncle died, and whom he was &s;till to marry as &s;oon as decency would permit. "And before this time (&s;aid the &s;tranger) he mu&s;t be her hu&s;band."</P>
<P>Before this time!&mdash;While I was cheri&s;hing romantic hopes! or, at lea&s;t, while, amid&s;t my di&s;tre&s;s, I had pre&s;erved inviolate the idea of his faith and my own.&mdash;But whither does this de|lu&s;ion carry me? Savillon has broken no faith; to me he never pledged it. Hide me, my friend, from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my folly, or let it &s;peak till its expiation be made, till I have bani&s;hed Sa|villon from my mind.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I then bani&s;h him from my mind? Mu&s;t I forget the &s;cenes of our early days, the opinions we formed, the authors we read, the mu&s;ic we played together? There was a time when I was wont to retire from the profanity of vulgar &s;ouls, to indulge the remembrance!</P>
<P>I heard &s;omebody tap at my door. I was in that &s;tate of mind which every thing terrifies; I fancy I looked terrified; for my mother, when &s;he
<PB N="55" REF="017578_0062_0FBA713183072580">
entered, begged me, in a low voice, not to be alarmed.</P>
<P>"I come to &s;ee you JULIA (&s;aid &s;he) before I go to bed; methought you looked ill at &s;up|per."&mdash;"Did I mamma? (&s;aid I) I am well enough; indeed I am." She pre&s;&s;ed my hand gently; I tried to &s;mile; it was with difficulty I forbore weeping.</P>
<P>"Your mind, child (continued my mother) is too tender; I fear it is, for this bad world. You mu&s;t learn to conquer &s;ome of its feelings, if you would be ju&s;t to your&s;elf; but I can pardon you, for I know how bewitching they are; but tru&s;t me, my love, they mu&s;t not be indulged too far; they poi&s;on the quiet of our lives. Alas! we have too little at be&s;t! I am aware how ungracious the doctrine is; but it is not the le&s;s true. If you ever have a child like your&s;elf, you will tell her this, in your turn, and &s;he will not believe you."</P>
<P>I was now weeping outright: It was the only an&s;wer I could make. My mother embraced me tenderly, and begged me to be calm, and endea|vour to re&s;t. I gave her my promi&s;e to go &s;oon to bed: I am about to perform it; but to re&s;t, MARIA!&mdash;farewell!</P>

<P>WHILE I write, my paper is blotted by my tears. They fall not now for my&s;elf, but for my father; you know not how he has wrung my heart.</P>

<P>On his return in the evening, he found my mother and me in &s;eparate apartments. She has complained of a &s;light di&s;order, from cold I be|lieve, the&s;e two or three days pa&s;t, and had lain down on a couch in her own room, till my fa|ther &s;hould return.

"Iphigenia! (&s;aid my father, taking up the book) Iphigenia!" He looked on me piteou&s;ly as he repeated the word. I cannot make you un|der&s;tand how much that &s;ingle name expre&s;&s;ed, nor how much that look. He pre&s;&s;ed me to his bo&s;om, and as he ki&s;&s;ed me, I felt a tear on his cheek.</P>
<P>"Your mother is in her own chamber, my love." I offered to go and fetch her: He held my hand fa&s;t as if he would not have me leave him. We &s;tood for &s;ome moments thus, till my mother, who had heard his voice, entered the room.</P>
<P>We &s;at down by the fire, with my father be|tween us. He looked on us alternately, with an affected cheerfulne&s;s, and &s;poke of indifferent things in a tone of gaiety rather unu&s;ual to him; but it was ea&s;y to &s;ee how foreign tho&s;e appear|ances were to the real movements of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>There was, at la&s;t, a pau&s;e of &s;ilence, which gave them time to overcome him. We &s;aw a tear, which he was unable to repre&s;s, begin to &s;teal from his eye.

He had one hand in his &s;ide, the other pre&s;&s;ed on his bo&s;om, his figure &s;eeming to ri&s;e above it&s;elf, and his eye bent &s;teadily forward.&mdash;Methought, as I looked on them, I was above the fears of humanity!</P>

Le Blanc entered. "'Tis enough," &s;aid my father, taking one or two &s;trides through the room, his countenance &s;till pre&s;erving an air of haughtine&s;s. "Go to my chamber, (&s;aid he to Le Blanc) I have &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s for you." When they left the room I felt the weakne&s;s of my &s;oul return.

ju&s;t. Do not be alarmed, my love, things may turn out better than they appear. I was affected too much before &s;upper, and could not conceal it.

But my father, MARIA!&mdash;thus to bear at once the weakne&s;s of age, the gripe of poverty, the buffets of a world with which his &s;pirit is already at war!&mdash;there my heart bleeds again!

Had he been more perfectly indulgent, methinks I &s;hould have pitied him le&s;s.</P>
<P>I was alarmed, by hearing my mother's bell: She had been &s;eized with a &s;udden fit of &s;ickne&s;s, and had almo&s;t fainted.

In the morning a phy&s;ician was &s;ent for, who cau&s;ed her to be blooded, and we thought her the better for it; but that was only for a &s;hort time, and next night &s;he was wor&s;e than before, and complained of violent pains all over her body, and particularly her brea&s;t, and did not once &s;hut her eyes to &s;leep. They took a greater quantity of blood from her now than at fir&s;t, and in the evening &s;he had a bli&s;ter put on, and the doctor &s;at by her, part of the night.

My ma&s;ter, in|deed, that la&s;t night took her away, and prevailed on her to put off her clothes, and go to bed, and I heard him &s;ay to her in a whi&s;per, when they had got upon the &s;tairs, "My JULIA have pity on your&s;elf for my &s;ake; let me not lo&s;e both;"&mdash;And he wept, I &s;aw, as he &s;poke; and &s;he bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>The fourth day my lady continued much in the &s;ame way, but during the night &s;he wandered a good deal, and &s;poke much of her hu&s;band and daughter, and frequently mentioned the Count de Montauban. The doctor ordered &s;ome things, I forget their proper name, to be laid to the &s;oles
<PB N="65" REF="017578_0072_0FBA7148A2458770">
of her feet, which &s;eemed to relieve her head much; for &s;he was more di&s;tinct towards morning, and knew me when I gave her drink, and called me by my name, which &s;he had not done before, but had taken me for my young lady; but her voice was fainter than ever, and her phy&s;ician looked more alarmed, when he vi&s;ited her, than I have &s;een him do all the re&s;t of her illne&s;s. My ma&s;ter was then in the room, and pre&s;ently they went out together; my lady called me to her, and a&s;ked who had gone out; when I told her, &s;he &s;aid, "I gue&s;s the rea&s;on; but heaven be prai&s;ed I can think of it without terror."</P>
<P>Her daughter entered the room ju&s;t then; &s;he went up to her mother, and a&s;ked how &s;he found her&s;elf. More at ea&s;e, my child, (&s;aid &s;he) but I will not deceive you into hope; I believe this mo|mentary relief is a fatal &s;ymptom; my own feel|ings tell me &s;o, and the doctor's looks confirm them.&mdash;"Do not &s;peak &s;o, my deare&s;t mo|ther! for Heaven's &s;ake, do not!"&mdash;was all &s;he could an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The doctor returned along with my ma&s;ter. He felt my lady's pul&s;e; Mi&s;s JULIA looked up wildly in his face: My ma&s;ter turned a&s;ide his head; but my lady, &s;weet angel, was calm and gentle as a lamb. "Do not flatter me, (&s;aid
<PB N="66" REF="017578_0073_0FBA714F1A4A1E28">
&s;he, when the doctor let go her arm;) I know you think I cannot recover."&mdash;"I am not without hopes, madam, (he replied) though, I confe&s;s my fears are &s;tronger than my hopes."&mdash;My lady looked upwards for a moment, as I have often &s;een her do in health. Her daughter flung her&s;elf on the bed; I thought &s;he had fallen into a &s;woon, and wanted to lift her up in my arms, though I was all of a tremble, and could hardly &s;upport my&s;elf. She &s;tarted up, and would have &s;poken to her mother; but &s;he wept and &s;obbed, and could not. My lady begged her to be com|po&s;ed; my ma&s;ter could not &s;peak, but he laid hold of her hand, and with a &s;ort of gentle force, led her out of the room.</P>
<P>My lady complained of a dryne&s;s on her mouth and lips: The doctor gave her a gla&s;s of water, into which he poured a little &s;omewhat out of a phial; &s;he thanked him when &s;he had drunk it, and &s;eemed to &s;peak ea&s;ier: He &s;aid, he &s;hould leave her for a little: Mon&s;. de Roubign&eacute; came in. "Attend my daughter," &s;aid &s;he to me; and I thought &s;he wanted to be alone with my ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I found Mi&s;s JULIA in the parlour, leaning on the table, her cheek re&s;ting on her hand; when I &s;poke, &s;he fell a crying again. Soon after her
<PB N="67" REF="017578_0074_0FBA7150F21A9960">
father came in, and told her that her mother wi&s;hed to &s;ee her; She returned along with my ma&s;ter, and they were &s;ome time together.</P>
<P>When I was called, I found my lady very low, by rea&s;on, as I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he had worn her&s;elf out in &s;peaking to them. The doctor &s;aid &s;o too, when he returned; and in the afternoon, when I attended him down &s;tairs, he &s;aid to me, "That excellent lady is going fa&s;t." He promi&s;ed to &s;ee her again in two hours; but, before that time, we found &s;he had grown much wor&s;e, and had lo&s;t her &s;peech altogether: So he was fetched im|mediately; and when he came, he &s;aid nothing was to be done, but to make her as ea&s;y as po&s;|&s;ible, and offered to &s;tay with her him&s;elf, which he did till about three next morning, when the dear good lady expired.</P>
<P>Her daughter fainted away, and it was a long time before the phy&s;ician could recover her. It is wonderful how my ma&s;ter bears up, in order to comfort her; but one may &s;ee how heavy his grief is on him for all that. This morning Mi&s;s JULIA de&s;ired me to attend her to the chamber, where her mother's corp&s;e is laid. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear her &s;peak &s;o calmly as &s;he did; and, though I made &s;o free as to di&s;&s;uade her much at fir&s;t, yet &s;he per&s;uaded me &s;he could bear it well enough,
<PB N="68" REF="017578_0075_0FBA71529620EEA8">
and I went with her accordingly. But when we came near the door, &s;he &s;topped, and pulled me back into her room, and leaned on my arm, and fell into a violent fit of weeping; yet, when I begged her to give over thoughts of going, &s;he &s;aid &s;he was ea&s;y again, and would go. And thus two or three times &s;he went and returned, till, at la&s;t, &s;he opened the door, in de&s;peration as one may &s;ay, and I went in clo&s;e behind her. The fir&s;t &s;ight we &s;aw was Mon&s;. de Roubign&eacute; at the bed-&s;ide, bending over the corp&s;e, and holding one of its hands in his. "Support me, Li&s;ette," cried &s;he; and leaned back on me again. My ma&s;ter turned about as &s;he &s;poke; his daughter took courage, as it were, then, and walked up to the body, and took the hand that her father had ju&s;t let drop, and ki&s;&s;ed it. "My child!" &s;aid he. "My father!" an&s;wered my dear young lady, and they cla&s;ped one another in their arms. I could not help bur&s;ting into tears when I &s;aw them; yet it was not altogether for grief neither: I know not how it was, but I weep when I think of it yet. May Heaven ble&s;s them both, and pre&s;erve them to &s;upport one another!</P>
<P>My lady's bell rung, and &s;he a&s;ked me if I had written to you. When I told her I had, &s;he en|quired
<PB N="69" REF="017578_0076_0FBA715A26D01C88">

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. JULIA TO MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>AT la&s;t, my MARIA, I am able to write. In the &s;ad &s;ociety of my afflicted father I have found no re&s;traint on my &s;orrows. We have indulged them to the full: Their fir&s;t turbulence is &s;ub&s;ided, and the &s;till quiet grief that now pre&s;&s;es on my bo&s;om, is &s;uch as my friend may participate.</P>

'Your lo&s;s is common to thou&s;ands.' Such is the hackneyed con&s;olation of ordinary minds, un|availing even when it is true. But mine is not common: It is not merely to lo&s;e a mother, the be&s;t, the mo&s;t indulgent of mothers!&mdash;Think, MARIA, think of your JULIA'S &s;ituation; how helple&s;s, how forlorn &s;he is!&mdash;A father pur|&s;ued by misfortune to the wane of life;&mdash;but, alas! he looks to her for &s;upport! He has out|lived the la&s;t of his friends; and tho&s;e who &s;hould have been linked to him by the ties of blood, the &s;ame fatal di&s;putes, which ruined his fortune, have &s;haken from his &s;ide. Beyond him,&mdash;and he is old, and affliction bla&s;ts his age!&mdash;beyond him, MARIA, and but for thee,&mdash;the world were de&s;olate around me.</P>
<P>My mother! you have &s;een, you have known her. Her gentle, but a&s;&s;ured &s;pirit, was the tutelary power to which we ever looked up for comfort and protection: To the la&s;t moment it enlightened her&s;elf, and guided us. The night before &s;he died, &s;he called me to her bed-&s;ide:&mdash;"I feel, my child, (&s;aid &s;he) as the greate&s;t bit|terne&s;s of parting, the thought of leaving you to affliction and di&s;tre&s;s. I have but one con|&s;olation to receive or to be&s;tow: A reliance on that merciful Being, who, in this hour, as in all the pa&s;t, has not for&s;aken me! Next to that Being,
<PB N="71" REF="017578_0078_0FBA715DF18D16D0">
you will &s;hortly be the only remaining &s;upport of the unfortunate Roubign&eacute;.&mdash;I had, of late, looked on one mea&s;ure as the means of procuring his age an additional &s;tay; but I will not pre|&s;cribe your conduct, or warp your heart. I know the purity of your &s;entiments, the warmth of your filial affection: To tho&s;e and the guidance of Heaven&mdash;"She had &s;poken thus far with difficulty: Her voice now failed in the attempt. My father came into the room: He &s;at down by me: She &s;tretched out her hand, and joining ours, which were both laid on the bed, together, &s;he cla&s;ped them with a feeble pre&s;&s;ure, leaned back|ward, &s;eemingly worn out with the exertion, and looked up to Heaven, as if directing us thither for that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which her words had bequeathed us; her la&s;t words! for after that &s;he could &s;carce|ly &s;peak to be heard, and only uttered &s;ome bro|ken &s;yllables, till &s;he lo&s;t the power of utterance altogether.</P>
<P>The&s;e words cannot be forgotten! they pre&s;s upon my mind with the &s;acredne&s;s of a parent's dying in&s;tructions! But that mea&s;ure they &s;ugge&s;t|ed&mdash;is it not again&s;t the dictates of a &s;till &s;u|perior power? I feel the thoughts of it as of a crime. Should it be &s;o, MARIA; or do I mi&s;|take the whi&s;pers of inclination for the &s;ugge&s;tions of con&s;cience? Yet I think I have &s;earched my

bo&s;om impartially, and its an&s;wer is uniform. Were it otherwi&s;e, &s;hould it ever be otherwi&s;e, what would not your JULIA do, to &s;mooth the latter days of a father, on who&s;e gray hairs di|&s;tre&s;&s;es are multiplied!</P>
<P>Methinks, &s;ince this la&s;t blow, he is greatly changed. That haughtine&s;s of &s;pirit, which &s;eemed to brave, but, in reality, was irritated by misfortune, has left him. He looks calmly upon things; they affect him more, but hurt him le&s;s; his tears fall oftener, but they are le&s;s terrible than the &s;ullen gloom which u&s;ed to darken his a&s;pect. I can now mingle mine with his, free to affliction, without unea&s;ine&s;s or fear; and tho&s;e offices of kindne&s;s, which once my piety exacted, are now the offering of my heart.</P>
<P>Montauban has behaved, on this occa&s;ion, as became his character. How perfect were it, but for that weakne&s;s which regards your JULIA! He came to &s;ee my father the day after that on which my mother died. "I will not endeavour (&s;aid he) to &s;top the current of your grief: That com|fort which the world offers at times like the&s;e, flows not from feeling, and cannot be addre&s;&s;ed to it. Your &s;orrow is ju&s;t: I come to give you lei&s;ure to indulge it: Employ me in tho&s;e irk&s;ome offices, which di&s;tre&s;s us more that the tears they oblige

us to dry: Think nothing too mean to impo&s;e on me, that can any how relieve my friend."</P>
<P>And this friend his daughter is forced to de|prive him of. Such at lea&s;t is the common pride of the &s;ex, that will not brook any other con|nection where one is rejected. I am a&s;&s;ailed by motives on every hand; but my own feelings are &s;till unconquered. Support them, my ever faith|ful MARIA, if they are ju&s;t; if not&mdash;but they cannot be unju&s;t.</P>
<P>The only friend of my own &s;ex, whom I po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed be&s;ides thee, is now no more! We needed no additional tie; yet, methinks, in the grief of my heart, I lean upon yours with increa&s;ing af|fection. Thou too&mdash;I will not &s;ay pity&mdash;thou &s;halt love me more.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. JULIA TO MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE, this moment, received your an&s;wer to my la&s;t. Ah! my friend, it an&s;wers not as <HI>I</HI> wi&s;hed. Is this forwardne&s;s in me, to hear, with plea&s;ure, only the arguments on one &s;ide, when my conduct &s;hould be guided by tho&s;e on both?</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="017578_0081_0FBA716736B7C830">
You &s;ay, "it is from the ab&s;ence of Savillon, that the impre&s;&s;ion he had made on my heart has gained its pre&s;ent &s;trength; that the contemplation of di&s;tant objects is always &s;tronger than the &s;en&s;e of pre&s;ent ones; and that, were I to &s;ee him now, were I daily to behold him the hu&s;band of another, I &s;hould &s;oon grow tranquil at the &s;ight. That it is inju&s;tice to my&s;elf, and a want of that proper pride, which &s;hould be the con&s;tant attendant of our &s;ex, to &s;uffer this unhappy attachment to over|come my mind; and, that after looking calmly on the world, you cannot allow &s;o much force to tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, as our youth was apt to &s;uppo&s;e in them. That they are commonly vanqui&s;hed by an effort to vanqui&s;h them; and that the &s;inking under their pre&s;&s;ure, is one of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es of the mind, which, like certain di&s;ea&s;es of the body, the exerci&s;e of its better faculties will very &s;oon remove."</P>
<P>There is rea&s;on in all this; but while you argue from rea&s;on, I mu&s;t decide from my feelings. In every one's own ca&s;e, there is a rule of judging, which is not the le&s;s powerful that one cannot ex|pre&s;s it.&mdash;I in&s;i&s;t not on the memory of Sa|villon; I can forget him, I think I can&mdash;time will be kind that way&mdash;It is fit I &s;hould forget him, he is happy as the hu&s;band of another.&mdash;But &s;hould I wed any man, be his worth what

it may, if I feel not that lively preference for him, which waits not for rea&s;oning to per&s;uade its con&s;ent? The &s;ugge&s;tions I have heard of Montauban's unwearied love, his uncommon vir|tues, winning my affections in a &s;tate of wedlock, I have always held a very dangerous experiment; there is equivocation in tho&s;e vows, which unite us to a hu&s;band, our affection for whom we leave to contingency.&mdash;"But I already e&s;teem and admire him."&mdash;It is mo&s;t true;&mdash;why is he not contented with my e&s;teem and admiration? If tho&s;e feelings are to be ripened into love, let him wait that period when my hand may be his without a blu&s;h. This I have already told him; he almo&s;t owned the inju&s;tice of his reque&s;t, but pleaded the ardour of pa&s;&s;ion in excu&s;e. Is this fair dealing, MARIA? that his feelings are to be an apology for his &s;uit, while mine are not al|lowed to be a rea&s;on for refu&s;al?</P>
<P>I am called away by my father; I heard the Count's voice below &s;ome time before. There was a &s;olemnity in my father's manner of a&s;king me down, which indicates &s;omething important in this vi&s;it. You &s;hall hear what that is, before this letter is clo&s;ed.&mdash;Again! he is come to fetch me.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="017578_0083_0FBA717039132908">
MARIA! let me recover my &s;urpri&s;e! Yet why &s;hould I be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> at the genero&s;ity of Mon|tauban? I know the native noblene&s;s of his &s;oul&mdash;Was it in &s;uch a girl as me to enfeeble it &s;o long?</P>
<P>My father led me into the parlour. Montauban was &s;tanding in a pen&s;ive po&s;ture; he made me a &s;ilent bow. I was placed in a chair, &s;tanding near another, which the Count had occupied be|fore: He &s;at down. My father walked to the window; his back was to us. Montauban put him&s;elf once or twice into the attitude of &s;peak|ing; but we were &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>My father turned and approached us. "The Count has &s;omething to communicate, JULIA. Would you choo&s;e, Sir, that it &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed to her alone?" "No, (an&s;wered he) it is an ex|piation to both, and both &s;hould hear it made. I fear, I have, unwillingly been the cau&s;e of di&s;|quiet to a family, who&s;e &s;ociety, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, has been one of the chief &s;weeteners of my life. They know my gratitude, for the ble&s;&s;ing of that intimacy they were kind enough to allow me. When I wi&s;hed for a tenderer connexion, they could not blame my wi&s;h; but when I pre&s;&s;ed it &s;o far as to wound their peace, I was unworthy of the e&s;teem they had formerly given, an e&s;teem
<PB N="77" REF="017578_0084_0FBA7171500931B0">

<P>Such were the words of Montauban. I know not what an&s;wer I made: I remember a movement of admiration, and no more. At that in&s;tant, he &s;eemed nobler than ever; and when, in &s;pite of his firmne&s;s, a tear broke forth, my pity al|mo&s;t carried me beyond e&s;teem. How happy might this man make another!

And now I am much vexed, that I &s;hould have given you &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s in vain, and &s;end this to let you know of the happy deliverance my ma&s;ter has met with, from that mo&s;t generous of men the Count de Montauban; I &s;ay, the mo&s;t generous of men, as to be &s;ure he is, to advance &s;o large a &s;um without any near pro&s;pect of being repaid, and without ever being a&s;ked to do &s;uch a favour; for I verily believe my ma&s;ter would die before he would a&s;k &s;uch a fa|vour of any one, &s;o high minded he is, notwith|&s;tanding all his misfortunes. He is ju&s;t now gone to &s;ee the Count, for that noble-hearted gentle|man would not come to our hou&s;e, le&s;t, as Mon&s;. de Roubign&eacute; &s;aid, he &s;hould &s;eem to triumph in the effects of his own genero&s;ity. Indeed, the thing was done as if it had been by witchcraft, without one of this family &s;u&s;pecting &s;uch a mat|ter; and the procureur never came back at all,
<PB N="82" REF="017578_0089_0FBA717CA406A418">
only &s;ent a paper, di&s;charging the debt, to one of the men he had left behind, who, upon that, behaved very civilly, and went away with much better manners, for&s;ooth, than they came; but Le Blanc followed them to the village, where they met the procureur, and thus it was that we di&s;covered the debt to have been paid by the Count, who, it &s;eems, had &s;ent that letter, but without a name, which the procureur received, when he left us at the time I wrote your lady&s;hip la&s;t.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. de Roubign&eacute; is returned from his vi&s;it to the Count de Montauban, and has been a long time clo&s;eted with my lady, and, to be &s;ure, &s;omething particular mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed, but what it is I can not gue&s;s; only I am certain it is &s;ome|thing more than common, becau&s;e I was in the way when they parted, and my lady pa&s;&s;ed me, and I &s;aw by her looks that there had been &s;ome|thing. When &s;he went into her own chamber I followed her, and there &s;he &s;at down, leaning her arm on her dre&s;&s;ing table, and gave &s;uch a &s;igh, as I thought her heart would have bur&s;t with it. Then I thought I might &s;peak, and a&s;ked if &s;he was not well; Very well, Li&s;ette, &s;aid &s;he; but &s;he &s;aid it as if &s;he was not well for all that, breathing &s;trongly, as &s;he &s;poke the words, as one

does when one has run one's &s;elf out of breath. "Leave me child (&s;aid &s;he) I will call you again by and by." And &s;o I left her as &s;he bid me, and as I went out of the room, &s;hutting the door &s;oftly behind me, I heard her &s;tart up from her chair, and &s;ay to her&s;elf "The lot is ca&s;t!" I think that was it.</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter has been all this while in his &s;tudy, writing, and ju&s;t now he called Le Blanc, and gave him a letter for the Count de Montauban, and Le Blanc told me, as he pa&s;&s;ed, that Mon&s;. de Roubign&eacute; looked gayer and more in &s;pirits than u&s;ual, when he gave it him. My lady is &s;till in her chamber alone, and has never called me, as &s;he promi&s;ed. Poor dear &s;oul! I am &s;ure I would do any thing to &s;erve her, that I would, and well I may, for &s;he is the kinde&s;t, &s;weete&s;t lady to me, and &s;o indeed &s;he is to every body.</P>
<P>And now, Madam, I am &s;ure I &s;hould a&s;k a thou&s;and pardons for u&s;ing the freedom to write to you in &s;uch a manner, ju&s;t by &s;tarts, as things happen. But I am &s;en&s;ible your lady&s;hip will not impute my doing &s;o to any want of re&s;pect, but only to my de&s;iring to give your lady&s;hip an ac|count of the &s;ituation of my lady, and of this fa|mily, which you were &s;o conde&s;cending as to &s;ay,

<HEAD>LETTER XIX. JULIA TO MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>IN the intricacies of my fate or of my conduct, I have long been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider you my &s;upport and my judge. For &s;ome days pa&s;t the&s;e have come thick upon me; but I could not find compo&s;ure enough to &s;tate them coolly even to my&s;elf. At this hour of midnight. I have &s;ummoned up a &s;till recollection of the pa&s;t; and with you, as my other con&s;cience, I will unfold and examine it.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="017578_0092_0FBA7183E691FE30">
The ready zeal of my faithful Li&s;ette has, I under&s;tand, &s;aved me a recital of the di&s;tre&s;s, in which my father found him&s;elf involved, from the con&s;equences of that law-&s;uit we have often lamented. I could only &s;hare it with him; but a more effectual friend &s;tepped forth in the Count de Montauban. His genero&s;ity relieved my fa|ther, and gave him back to freedom and your JULIA.</P>
<P>The manner of his doing this was &s;uch as the delicacy of a mind, jealous of its own honour, would prompt in the cau&s;e of another's. I thought I &s;aw a circum&s;tance, previous to the Count's per|forming it, which added to that delicacy. My father did not then perceive this; it was not till he waited on Montauban, that the force of it &s;truck his mind.</P>
<P>When he returned home, I &s;aw &s;ome remains of that pride, which formerly rankled under the receipt of favours it was unable to return. "My JULIA, (&s;aid he) your father is unhappy, every way unhappy; but it is fit I &s;hould be humble&mdash;Pierre de Roubign&eacute; mu&s;t learn humility!" He ut|tered the&s;e words in a tone that frightened me; I could not &s;peak. He &s;aw me confu&s;ed, I be|lieve, and, putting on a milder a&s;pect, took my hand and ki&s;&s;ed it.&mdash;"Heaven knows, that, for

my&s;elf, I rate not life or liberty at much;&mdash;but, when I thought what my child mu&s;t &s;uffer&mdash;I alone am left to protect her&mdash;and I am old and weak, and mu&s;t a&s;k for that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which I am unable to repay." "The generous, Sir, (&s;aid I) know from their own hearts what yours can feel: All beyond is accident alone." "The generous, indeed, my child! but you know not all the ge|nero&s;ity of Montauban. When he tore him&s;elf from tho&s;e hopes which his love had taught him; when he renounced his preten&s;ions to that hand, which I know can alone confer happine&s;s on his life; it was but for a more delicate opportunity of relieving thy father.&mdash;I could not (&s;aid he) while I &s;ought your daughter's love, bear the ap|pearance of purcha&s;ing it by a favour; now, when I have renounced it for ever, I am free to the offices of friend&s;hip.&mdash;Had you &s;een him, JULIA, when he pronounced this <HI>for ever&punc;</HI> great as his &s;oul is, he wept! by Heaven he wept, at pro|nouncing it!&mdash;The&s;e tears, JULIA, the&s;e tears of my friend!&mdash;Would I had met my dungeon in &s;ilence! they had not torn my heart thus!"</P>
<P>MARIA, mine was &s;welled to a &s;ort of en|thu&s;ia&s;tic madne&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>I full at his feet.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="017578_0094_0FBA7189D2B26850">
"No, my father, they &s;hall not.&mdash;Amid&s;t the fall of her family, your daughter &s;hall not &s;tand aloof in &s;afety. She would have &s;hared the pri&s;on of her father in the pride of adver&s;ity; behold her now the partner of his humiliation! Tell the Count de Montauban, that JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute;; offers that hand to his genero&s;ity, which &s;he refu&s;ed to his &s;olicitation;&mdash;tell him al&s;o, &s;he is above deceit: She will not conceal the &s;mall value of the gift. 'Tis but the offering of a wretch, who would &s;omehow requite the &s;uf|ferings of her father, and the &s;ervices of his friend. If he &s;hall now reject it, that ugly debt, which his unhappine&s;s lays us under, will be repaid in the aba&s;ement &s;he endures; if he accepts of it as it is, tell him its mi&s;tre&s;s is not ignorant of the duty that &s;hould attend it."</P>
<P>My father &s;eemed to recover at my words; yet &s;urpri&s;e was mixed with the &s;atisfaction his coun|tenance expre&s;&s;ed. "Are the&s;e your &s;entiments, my love? pre&s;&s;ing my hand clo&s;er in his&mdash;The heroi&s;m of duty was wa&s;ted&mdash;I an&s;wered him with my tears. "Speak, (&s;aid he) my JULIA, coolly; and let not the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of your father warp your re&s;olution. He can endure any thing, even his gratitude &s;hall be &s;ilenced."&mdash;My for|titude revived again.&mdash;"There is &s;ome weak|ne&s;s, Sir, attends even our be&s;t re&s;olves: Mine

are not without it; but they are fixed, and I have &s;poken them." He a&s;ked if he might acquaint Mon&s;. de Montauban. "Immediately, Sir, (I an&s;wered) if you plea&s;e; the &s;ooner he knows my re&s;olution, the more will he &s;ee it flowing from my heart." My father went into his &s;tudy, and wrote a letter, which he read to me. It was not all I could have wi&s;hed, yet I could not mend it by correction. Who &s;hall give words to the &s;oul at &s;uch a time? My very thoughts are not accu|rate expre&s;&s;ions of what I feel: There is &s;ome|thing bu&s;y about my heart, which I cannot reduce into thinking.&mdash;Oh! MARIA!</P>
<P>Montauban came immediately on receipt of this letter; we did not expect him that night; we were at &s;upper. In what a &s;ituation was your JULIA while it la&s;ted? In this terrible interval, I was obliged to meet his eye &s;ometimes, in ad|dre&s;&s;ing ordinary civilities to him. To &s;ee him, to &s;peak to him thus, while the fate of my life was within the power of a few little words, was &s;uch torture, as it required the utmo&s;t of my re|&s;olution to bear. My father &s;aw it, and put as &s;peedy an end to our meal as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;We were left alone.</P>
<P>My father &s;poke fir&s;t, not without he&s;itation. Montauban was &s;till more confu&s;ed; but it was
<PB N="89" REF="017578_0096_0FBA718C24B3FF00">
the confu&s;ion of a happy man. He &s;poke &s;ome half &s;entences about the delicacy of my &s;entiments and his own, but was entangled there, and I think, not able to extricate him&s;elf. At la&s;t, turning fuller towards me, who &s;at the &s;ilent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;cene, (why &s;hould I &s;core through that word when writing to you? yet it is a bad one, and I pray you to forgive it) he &s;aid, he knew his own unworthine&s;s of that hand, which my genero&s;ity had now allowed me to hope for; but that every endeavour of his future life&mdash;the re&s;t was com|mon place; for his &s;ex have but one &s;ort of ex|pre&s;&s;ion for the exulting mode&s;ty of &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;My father put my hand in his&mdash;I was obliged to rai&s;e my eyes from the ground and look on him; his were bent earne&s;tly on me: There was too, too much joy in them, MARIA; mine could not bear them long.

Fallen as his fortunes are, not the wealth of worlds had pur|cha&s;ed it: To your friend&s;hip, to your virtue, he is ble&s;&s;ed in bequeathing it."&mdash;"I know its value &s;aid the Count, and receive it as the deare&s;t gift of Heaven and you."

<HEAD>LETTER XX. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</HEAD>
<P>GIVE me joy, Segarva, give me joy&mdash;the lovely JULIA is mine. Let not the torpid con&s;iderations of prudence, which your la&s;t letter contained, ri&s;e up to check the hap|pine&s;s of your friend, or that which his good fortune will be&s;tow on you. Tru&s;t me, thy fears are groundle&s;s&mdash;did&s;t thou but know her as I do!&mdash;Perhaps I am tenderer that way than u&s;ual; but there were &s;ome of your fears I felt a blu&s;h at in reading. Talk not of the loo&s;ene&s;s of marriage-vows in <HI>France,</HI> nor compare her with tho&s;e women of it, who&s;e heads are giddy with the follies of fa&s;hion, and who&s;e hearts are de|bauched by the manners of its votaries. Her virtue was ever above the breath of &s;u&s;picion, and I dare pledge my life, it will ever continue &s;o. But that is not enough; I can feel, as you do, that it is not enough. I know the noblene&s;s of her &s;oul, the delicacy of her &s;entiments. She would not give me her hand except from motives of regard and affection, were I ma&s;ter of millions. I rejoice that her own &s;ituation is &s;uch, as infers no &s;u&s;picion of intere&s;tedne&s;s in me; were &s;he
<PB N="91" REF="017578_0098_0FBA719371AF40E8">
not JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute;, I would not have wedded her with the world for her dower.</P>
<P>You talk of her former reluctance; but I am not young enough to imagine that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a marriage to be happy without that glow of rapture which lovers have felt and poets de&s;cribed. Tho&s;e &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion are not the ba&s;is for wed|ded felicity, which wi&s;dom would chu&s;e, becau&s;e they are only the delirium of a month, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion de&s;troys, and di&s;appointment follows. I have perfect confidence in the affection of JU|LIA, though it is not of that intemperate kind, which &s;ome brides have &s;hewn. Had you &s;een her eyes, how they &s;poke, when her father gave me her hand! there was &s;till a reluctance in them, a reluctance more winning than all the flu&s;h of con&s;ent could have made her. Mode&s;ty and fear, e&s;teem and gratitude, darkened and enlightened them by turns; and tho&s;e tears, tho&s;e &s;ilent tears, which they &s;hed, gave me a more &s;acred bond of her attachment, than it was in the power of words to have formed.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes allowed my&s;elf to think, or rather I have &s;uppo&s;ed you thinking, it might be held an imputation on the purity of her affection, that from an act of genero&s;ity towards her father, (with the circum&s;tances of which I was under the
<PB N="92" REF="017578_0099_0FBA6F81965360B8">
nece&s;&s;ity of acquainting you in my la&s;t) her hand became rather a debt of gratitude than a gift of love. But there is a deception in tho&s;e romantic &s;ounds, which tell us, that pure affection &s;hould be unbia&s;&s;ed in its di&s;po&s;al of a lover or a mi&s;tre&s;s. If they &s;ay, that affection is a mere involuntary impul&s;e, neither waiting the deci&s;ions of rea&s;on, or the di&s;&s;ua&s;ives of prudence, do they not in re|ality degrade us to machines, which are blindly actuated by &s;ome uncontrolable power? If they allow a woman rea&s;onable motives for her attach|ment, what can be &s;tronger than tho&s;e &s;entiments which excite her e&s;teem, and tho&s;e proofs of them which produce her gratitude?</P>
<P>But why do I thus rea&s;on on my happine&s;s? I feel no fears, no &s;u&s;picion of alloy to it; and I will not &s;earch for them in ab&s;tract opinion, or in di&s;tant conjecture.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day next is fixed for the day that is to unite us; the &s;hew and ceremony that mingle &s;o ill with the feelings of a time like this, our &s;ituation here renders unnece&s;&s;ary. A few of tho&s;e &s;imple or|naments, in which my JULIA meets the gave of the admiring ru&s;tics around us, are more congenial to her beauty than all the trappings of vanity or magnificence. We propo&s;e pa&s;&s;ing a week or two
<PB N="93" REF="017578_0100_0FBA6F838669A1D0">
here, before removing to Montauban, where I mu&s;t then carry my wife, to &s;hew my people their mi&s;tre&s;s, and receive that &s;ort of homage, which I hope I have taught them to pay from the heart. Tho&s;e relations of my family, who live in that neighbourhood, mu&s;t come and learn to love me better than they did. Methinks I &s;hall now be more ea&s;ily plea&s;ed with them than I formerly was. I know not if it is nobler to de&s;pi&s;e in&s;igni|ficant people, than to bear with them coolly; but I believe it is much le&s;s agreeable. The a&s;perities of our own mind recoil on it&s;elf. JULIA has &s;hewn me the bli&s;s of lo&s;ing them.</P>
<P>Could I hope for my Segarva at Montauban?&mdash;Much as I doat on my lovely bride, there wants the la&s;t approval of my &s;oul, till he &s;miles on this marriage and ble&s;&s;es it. I know, there needs on|ly his coming thither to grant this.&mdash;I antici|pate your an&s;wer, that now it is impo&s;&s;ible; but let it be a debt on the future, which <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> of your lei&s;ure is to pay.

The <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of your JULIA, I know, is ever the warme&s;t ob|ject of your wi&s;hes.&mdash;A&s;k me not, why I cannot an&s;wer even this directly&mdash;Be &s;atisfied when I tell you, that I ought to be happy.&mdash;Mon|tauban has every de&s;ire to make me &s;o.&mdash;</P>
<P>One thing I wi&s;h to accompli&s;h towards his peace and mine. The hi&s;tory of this poor heart I have entru&s;ted only to your memory and my own: I will endeavour, though I know with how much difficulty, henceforth to forget it forever. You mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me, by holding it a blank, which recollection is no more to full up. I know the

My hu&s;band has now a right to every better thought; it were un|ju&s;t to embitter tho&s;e hours, which are but half the property of JULIA DE MONTAUBAN, with the remembrance of former ones, which belonged to &s;adne&s;s and JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute;.</P>
<P>We are on the eve of our departure for the fa|mily ca&s;tle of Mon&s;. de Montauban. My father, who&s;e happine&s;s, at pre&s;ent, is a flattering te&s;ti|mony, as well as a &s;upport to my piety, accom|panies us thither, but is &s;oon to return home, where our cou&s;in, La Pelliere, whom you may remember having &s;een with my mother in <HI>Paris</HI> is to keep hou&s;e for him. This &s;eparation I can|not help looking to as a calamity; yet, I believe, his rea&s;ons for it are ju&s;t. What a change in a woman's &s;ituation does this momentous connexion make?&mdash;I will think no more of it.&mdash;Farewell.</P>
<P>Yet a few words, to own my folly at lea&s;t, if I cannot amend it. I went to a&s;&s;ort &s;ome little articles of dre&s;s for carrying home with me;

while I was rummaging out a drawer to find one of them, a little picture of Savillon, drawn for him when a boy, by a painter who was accidentally in our neighbourhood, cro&s;&s;ed me in the way. You cannot ea&s;ily imagine how this circum&s;tance di&s;concerted me. I &s;hut the drawer as if it had contained a viper; then opened it again; and again the countenance of Savillon, mild and thoughtful, (for even then it was thoughtful) met my view!&mdash;Was it a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>guilt</HI> that turned my eye involuntarily to the door of the ap|partment?&mdash;Can there be any in accidentally thinking of Savillon!&mdash;Yet I fear I looked too long, and too impa&s;&s;ionedly on this minature.

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. JULIA TO MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>MY father was with me this morning, in my chamber, for more than an hour. We &s;at, &s;ometimes &s;ilent, &s;ometimes &s;peaking inter|rupted &s;entences, and tears were frequently all the intercour&s;e we held. Li&s;ette coming in, to acquaint us that Montauban was in the parlour, waiting us, at length put an end to our interview. "JULIA, (&s;aid my father) I imagined I had much to &s;ay to you; but the importance of my thoughts, on your behalf, &s;tifles my expre&s;&s;ion of them. There are moments when I cannot help looking to that &s;eparation, which your marriage will make between us, as if it were the lo&s;s of my child; yet I have fortitude enough to re&s;i&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion, and to reflect that &s;he is going to be happy with the worthie&s;t of men. My in&s;truction for your conduct in that &s;tate you have ju&s;t entered
<PB N="102" REF="017578_0109_0FBA7012B0DBC830">
into, your own &s;entiments, I tru&s;t, would render unnece&s;&s;ary, were they in no other way &s;upplied, but I di&s;covered lately in your mother's bureau, a paper which &s;till farther &s;uper&s;edes their ne|ce&s;&s;ity. It contains &s;ome advices, which expe|rience and ob&s;ervation had enabled her to give, and her regard for you had prompted her to write down. 'Tis, however, only a fragment, which accident or diffidence of her&s;elf has prevented her completing; but it is worthy of your &s;erious per|u&s;al, and you will read it with more warmth than if it came from a general in&s;tructor." He left the paper with me; I have read it with the care, with the affection it de&s;erves; I &s;end a copy of it now, as I would every good thing, for the participation of my friend. She cannot read it with the intere&s;t of a daughter; but &s;he will find it no cold, nor common lecture. It &s;peaks, if I am not too partial to the be&s;t of mothers, the language of prudence, but not of artifice; it would mend the heart by &s;entiment, not cover it with di&s;&s;imulation. She, for who&s;e u&s;e it was written, has need of &s;uch a monitor, and would li&s;ten to no other; if &s;he has paid any debt to prudence, it was not from the obligation of wi&s;|dom, but the impul&s;e of feeling.</P>
<PB N="103" REF="017578_0110_0FBA7013E8691BA8">
<P>"For my Daughter JULIA.</P>
<P>"Before this can reach you, the hand that writes it and the heart that dictates, &s;hall be mouldering in the grave. I mean it to &s;upply the place of &s;ome cautions, which I &s;hould think it my duty to deliver to you, &s;hould I live to &s;ee you a wife. The precepts it contains, you have often heard me inculcate but I know that general ob&s;ervations on a po&s;&s;ible event, have much le&s;s force than tho&s;e which apply to our immediate condition. In the fate of a woman, marriage is the mo&s;t important cri&s;is: It fixes her in a &s;tate, of all others the mo&s;t happy, or the mo&s;t wretched; and though mere precept can perhaps do little in any ca&s;e, yet there is a natural propen&s;ity to try its efficacy in all. She who writes this paper, has been long a wife, and a mother; the experi|ence of one, and the anxiety of the other, prompt her in&s;tructions; and &s;he has been too happy in both characters to have much doubt of their truth, or fear of their reception.</P>
<P>"Sweetne&s;s of temper, affection to a hu&s;band, and attention to his intere&s;ts, con&s;titute the du|ties of a wife, and form the ba&s;is of matrimonial felicity. The&s;e are indeed the texts, from which every rule for attaining this felicity is drawn. The
<PB N="104" REF="017578_0111_0FBA70153A6422A8">
charms of beauty, and the brilliancy of wit, though they may captivate in the mi&s;tre&s;s, will not long delight in the wife: They will &s;horten even their own tran&s;itory reign, if, as I have &s;een in many wives, they &s;hine more for the attraction of every body el&s;e than of their hu&s;bands. Let the plea&s;ing of that one per&s;on be a thought ne|ver ab&s;ent from your conduct. If he loves you as you would wi&s;h he &s;hould, he would bleed at heart &s;hould he &s;uppo&s;e it for a moment with|drawn: If he does not, his pride will &s;upply the place of love, and his re&s;entment that of &s;uf|fering.</P>
<P>"Never con&s;ider a trifle what may tend to plea&s;e him. The great articles of duty he will &s;et down as his own; but the le&s;&s;er attentions he will mark as favours; and tru&s;t me, for I have experienced it, there is no feeling more delight|ful to one's-&s;elf, than that of turning tho&s;e little things to &s;o precious a u&s;e.</P>
<P>"If you marry a man of a certain &s;ort, &s;uch as the romance of young minds generally paints for a hu&s;band, you will deride the &s;uppo&s;ition of any po&s;&s;ible decrea&s;e in the ardour of your af|fections. But wedlock, even in its happie&s;t lot, is not exempted from the common fate of all &s;ub|lunary ble&s;&s;ings; there is ever a delu&s;ion in hope
<PB N="105" REF="017578_0112_0FBA7016C411A428">
which cannot abide with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The rapture of extravagant love will evaporate and wa&s;te; the conduct of the wife mu&s;t &s;ub&s;titute in its room other regards, as delicate, and more la&s;ting. I &s;ay, the conduct of the wife; for marriage, be a hu&s;band what he may, rever&s;es the prerogative of &s;ex; his will expect to be plea&s;ed, and ours mu&s;t be &s;edulous to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>"This privilege a good natured man may wave. He will feel it, however, due; and third per&s;ons will have penetration enough to &s;ee, and may have malice enough to remark, the want of it in his wife. He mu&s;t be a hu&s;band unworthy of you, who could bear the degradation of &s;uf|fering this in &s;ilence. The idea of power on either &s;ide, &s;hould be totally bani&s;hed from the &s;y&s;tem: It is not &s;ufficient that the hu&s;band &s;hould never have occa&s;ion to regret the want of it; the wife mu&s;t &s;o behave, that he may never con|&s;cious of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>"But my JULIA, if a mother's fondne&s;s de|ceives me not, &s;tands not much in need of cau|tions like the&s;e. I cannot allow my&s;elf the idea of her wedding a man, on whom &s;he would not wi&s;h to be dependent, or who&s;e inclinations a temper like hers would de&s;ire to controul. She will be more in danger from that &s;oftne&s;s, that
<PB N="106" REF="017578_0113_0FBA701B9FD2BE68">
&s;en&s;ibility of &s;oul, which will yield perhaps too much for the happine&s;s of both. The office of a wife includes the exertion of a friend: A good one mu&s;t frequently &s;trengthen and &s;upport that weakne&s;s, which a bad one would endeavour to overcome. There are &s;ituations, where it will not be enough to love, to cheri&s;h, to obey: She mu&s;t teach her hu&s;band to be at peace with him|&s;elf, to be reconciled to the world, to re&s;i&s;t mis|fortune, to conquer adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>"Alas! my child, I am here an in&s;tructre&s;s but too well &s;killed! The&s;e tears, with which this paper is &s;oiled, fell not in the pre&s;ence of your father, though, now, they but trace the re|membrance of what, then, it was my lot to feel. Think it not impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train your feelings, becau&s;e they are &s;trong. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of feel|ing will &s;ometimes overcome di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which the cold heart of prudence had been unable to en|dure.</P>
<P>"But <HI>misfortune</HI> is not always <HI>mi&s;ery.</HI> I have known this truth; I am proud to believe, that I have &s;ometimes taught it to Roubign&eacute;. Thanks be to that power, who&s;e decrees I reverence! He often tempered the angui&s;h of our &s;ufferings, till there was a &s;ort of luxury in feeling them. Then is the triumph of wedded love!&mdash;the tie that
<PB N="107" REF="017578_0114_0FBA701CAA4C6268">
binds the happy may be dear; but that which links the unfortunate is tenderne&s;s unutterable.</P>
<P>"There are afflictions le&s;s ea&s;y to be endured, which your mother has not experienced: Tho&s;e which a hu&s;band inflicts, and the be&s;t wives feel the mo&s;t &s;everely. The&s;e, like all our &s;harpe&s;t calamities, the fortitude that can re&s;i&s;t, can only cure. Complainings deba&s;e her who &s;uffers, and harden him who aggrieves. Let not a woman al|ways look for their cau&s;e in the inju&s;tice of her lord: They may proceed from many trifling errors in her own conduct, which virtue cannot blame, though wi&s;dom mu&s;t regret. If &s;he makes this di&s;covery, let them be amended without a thought, if po&s;&s;ible, at any rate without an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of merit in amending them. In this, and in every other in&s;tance, it mu&s;t never be forgot|ten, that the only government allowed on our &s;ide, is that of gentlene&s;s and attraction; and that its power, like the fabled influence of ima|ginary beings, mu&s;t be invi&s;ible to be complete.</P>
<P>"Above all, let a wife beware of communi|cating to others any want of duty or tenderne&s;s, &s;he may think &s;he has perceived in her hu&s;band. This untwi&s;ts, at once, tho&s;e delicate cords, which pre&s;erve the unity of the marriage-engage|ment.
<PB N="108" REF="017578_0115_0FBA701E3484A420">
Its &s;acredne&s;s is broken forever, if third parties are made witne&s;&s;es of its failings, or um|pires of its di&s;putes. It may &s;eem almo&s;t profane in me to confe&s;s, that once, when, through the malice of an enemy, I was made, for a &s;hort time, to believe, that my Roubign&eacute; had wrong|ed me, I dur&s;t not, even in my prayers to Hea|ven petition for a re&s;toration of his love; I prayed to be made a better wife: When I would have &s;aid, a more beloved one, my utterance failed me for the word."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXV. JULIA TO MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>WE have got to the end of our journey; and I am now the mi&s;tre&s;s of this man&s;ion. Our journey was too &s;hort and too &s;low; I wi&s;hed for &s;ome mechanical relief from my feelings in the rapidity of a po&s;t-chai&s;e; our progre&s;s was too &s;tately to be expeditious, and we reached not this place, though but &s;ix leagues di&s;tant, till the evening.</P>
<P>Methinks I have &s;uffered a good deal; but my heart is not callous yet; el&s;e wherefore was it wrung &s;o, at leaving my father's peaceful retreat;
<PB N="109" REF="017578_0116_0FBA7022AF843AF8">
I did not tru&s;t my&s;elf with looking back; but I was too well acquainted with the objects, not to recollect every tree from the &s;ide window as we pa&s;&s;ed. A little ragged boy, who keeps &s;ome &s;heep of my father's opened the gate for us at the end of the furthermo&s;t inclo&s;ure; he pulled off his hat, which he had adorned with &s;ome gay|coloured ribands in honour of the occa&s;ion; Montauban threw money into it, and the boy fol|lowed us, for &s;ome time, with a number of ble&s;&s;ings. When he turned back, methought I envied him his return. The full picture of the place we had left, ro&s;e before me; it needed all my re&s;olution, and all my fears of offending, to prevent my weeping outright. At our dinner on the road, I was very bu&s;y, and affected to be very much plea&s;ed; La Peiliere was a lucky com|panion for me; you know how full &s;he is of ob|&s;ervation on trifles. When we approached the hou&s;e, &s;he &s;poke of every thing, and prai&s;ed every thing; I had nothing to do but to a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>We entered between two rows of lime-trees, at the end of which is the gate of the hou&s;e, wide and rudely magnificent; its large leaves were opened to receive us by an old but fre&s;h-looking &s;ervant, who &s;eemed too hone&s;t to be polite, and did not &s;hew me quite &s;o much curte&s;y as &s;ome
<PB N="110" REF="017578_0117_0FBA70242A4A10A8">
mi&s;tre&s;&s;es would have expected. All the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances however were in a &s;tile, which my friend has heard me commend; yet was I weak enough, not perfectly to reli&s;h them when they happened to my&s;elf. There was a pre&s;aging gloom about this man&s;ion which filled my ap|proach with terror; and when Montauban's old dome&s;tic opened the coach-door, I looked upon him as a criminal might do on the me&s;&s;enger of death, My dreams ever &s;ince have been full of horror; and while I write the&s;e lines, the creaking of the pendulum of the great clock in the hall, &s;ounds like the knell of your devoted JULIA.</P>
<P>I expect you to rally me on my ideal terrors. You may remember, when we u&s;ed to &s;teal a mid|night hour's conver&s;ation together, you would laugh at my foreboding of a &s;hort period to my life, and often jeeringly tell me, I was born to be a great-grandmother in my time. I know the fooli&s;hne&s;s of this impre&s;&s;ion, though I have not yet been able to conquer it. But to me it is not the &s;ource of di&s;quiet; I never feel more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of my&s;elf than at tho&s;e moments when I indulge it the mo&s;t. Why &s;hould "I wi&s;h for long life? Why &s;hould &s;o many wi&s;h for it? Did we &s;it down to number the calamities of this world; did we think how many wretches there are of di&s;ea&s;e, of poverty, of oppre&s;&s;ion, of vice, (alas!

<P>MY readers will ea&s;ily perceive &s;omething particular, in the place where the follow|ing letters of <HI>Savillon</HI> are found, as they are ma|nife&s;tly of a date con&s;iderably prior to many of the preceding.

While I conjectured this rea&s;on for their pre&s;ent order, I was aware of &s;ome advantage, which the&s;e papers, as relating a &s;tory, might de|rive from an alteration in that particular; but, after balancing tho&s;e different con&s;iderations, without coming to any deci&s;ion, my indolence,

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI. SAVILLON TO BEAUVARIS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER a very unfavourable pa&s;&s;age, we are at la&s;t arrived at our de&s;tined port. A &s;hip is lying along-&s;ide of us, ready to fail for <HI>France,</HI> and every one on board, who can write, is now writing to &s;ome relation or friend the hard&s;hips of his voyage, and the period of his arrival. How few has Savillon to greet with ti|dings! to Roubign&eacute; I have already written; to Beauvaris I am now writing; and when I have excepted the&s;e, there is not in <HI>France</HI> a &s;ingle man, to whom I am entitled to write. Yet I mean not to cla&s;s them together: To Roubign&eacute;
<PB N="2" REF="017578_0123_0FBA70329FE67548">
I owe the tribute of e&s;teem, the debt of gratitude; for you I feel &s;omething tenderer than either. Roubign&eacute; has been the guide, the father of my youth, and him I reverence as a parent: You have been the friend, the brother, of my &s;oul, and with yours it mingles as with a part of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>You remember the circum&s;tances of our parting. You would not bid me adieu till the &s;hip was getting under way: I believe you judged aright, if you meant to &s;pare us both: The bu&s;tle of the &s;cene, the rattling of the &s;ails, the noi&s;e of the &s;ailors, had a mechanical effect on the mind, and &s;tifled tho&s;e tender feelings, which we indulge in &s;olitude and &s;ilence. When I went to bed, I had time to indulge them. I found it vain to attempt &s;leeping, and &s;carcely wi&s;hed to &s;ucceed in at|tempting it. About midnight I aro&s;e, and went upon deck. The wind had been fair all day, and we were then, I &s;uppo&s;e, more than thirty leagues from the &s;hore. I looked on the arch of Heaven, where the moon pur&s;ued her cour&s;e un|clouded; and my ear caught no &s;ound, except the &s;tilly noi&s;e of the &s;ea around me. I thought of my di&s;tance from <HI>France</HI> as of &s;ome illu&s;ive dream, and could not believe, without an effort, that it was not four and twenty hours &s;ince we parted. I recollected a thou&s;and things which I
<PB N="3" REF="017578_0124_0FBA7033E6DA3A60">
&s;hould have &s;aid to you, and &s;poke them, involun|tarily in the ear of night.</P>
<P>There was, my friend, there was one thing, which I meant to have told you at parting. Had you &s;taid a few moments longer in the room after the &s;eamen called us, I &s;hould have &s;poken it then; but you &s;hunned being alone with me, and I could not command even words enough to tell you, that I wi&s;hed to &s;peak to you in private Hear it now, and pity your Savillon.</P>
<P>JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute;!&mdash;Did you feel that name as I do!&mdash;Even traced with my own pen, what throbbing remembrances has it rai&s;ed!&mdash;You are acquainted with my obligations to her father: You have heard me &s;ometimes talk of her; but you know not, for I tremble to tell you, the power &s;he has acquired over the heart of your friend.</P>
<P>The fate of my father, as well as mutual in|clination, made Roubign&eacute; his friend; for this la&s;t is of a temper formed rather to delight in the pride of a&s;&s;i&s;ting unfortunate worth, than in the joy of knowing it in a better &s;ituation. After the death of my father, I became the ward of his friend's genero&s;ity: A &s;tate I &s;hould have brooked ill, had not JULIA been his daugh|ter.

From tho&s;e early days, when fir&s;t I knew her, I remember her friend&s;hip as making part of my exi&s;tence: Without her, plea&s;ure was vapid, and &s;orrow, in her &s;ociety, was changed into en|joyment. At that time of life, the mind has little re&s;erve. We meant but friend&s;hip, and called it &s;o without alarm. The love, to which at length I di&s;covered my heart to be &s;ubject, had conquered without tumult, and become de&s;potic under the &s;emblance of freedom.</P>
<P>The misfortunes of her family fir&s;t &s;hewed me how I loved.&mdash;When her father told them the ruined &s;tate of his fortune, when he prepared them for leaving the now alienated &s;eat of his ance&s;tors, I was a &s;pectator of the &s;cene. When I &s;aw the old man, with indignant pride, &s;tifling the angui&s;h of his heart, and pointing to the chai&s;e that was to carry them from <HI>Belville,</HI> his wife, with one hand cla&s;ping her hu&s;band's, the other laid on her bo&s;om, turning up to Heaven a look of re&s;ignation; his daughter, &s;triving to check her tears, kneeling before him, and vowing her duty to his misfortunes; then did I fir&s;t cur&s;e my poverty, which prevented me from throwing my&s;elf at her feet, and bidding her parents be happy with their JULIA!&mdash;The luxury of the idea &s;till ru&s;hes on my mind!&mdash;to heal the for|tunes of my father's friend; to ju&s;tify the ways
<PB N="5" REF="017578_0126_0FBA703970642348">
of Heaven to his &s;aint-like wife; to wipe the tears from the eyes of his angel daughter!&mdash;Beauvaris, our Philo&s;ophy is fal&s;e: Power and wealth are the choice&s;t gifts of Heaven: To po&s;|&s;e&s;s them indeed, is nothing, but thus to u&s;e them, is rapture!</P>
<P>I had them not thus to u&s;e; but what I could, I did. I attended his family to that antient man|&s;ion, which was now the &s;ole property of the once opulent Roubign&eacute;. With unwearied attention I &s;oothed his &s;orrows, and humbled my&s;elf before his misfortunes, as much as I had formerly re|&s;i&s;ted dependence on his pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>He felt the a&s;&s;iduity of my friend&s;hip, and I &s;aw him grateful for its exertion; yet would the idea of being obliged, often rankle in his mind; and I have &s;een him frequently look at me with an appearance of anger, when he thought I was con&s;cious of obliging him.</P>
<P>Far different was the gentle nature of his daugh|ter. She thanked me with unfeigned gratitude for my &s;ervices to her father, and &s;eemed &s;olici|tous to compen&s;ate with her &s;miles, for that wan of acknowledgment &s;he ob&s;erved in him.</P>
<P>Had my heart been free before, it was impo&s;|&s;ible to pre&s;erve its freedom now. A &s;pectator of
<PB N="6" REF="017578_0127_0FBA703AAF59A888">
all tho&s;e excellencies which, though &s;he ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, her pre&s;ent &s;ituation alone could give full room to exert; all that &s;ublimity of mind, which bore adver&s;ity unmoved; all that gentlene&s;s, which contrived to lighten it to her father, and &s;mooth the rankling of his haughty &s;oul! I ap|plauded the election I had made, and looked on my love as a virtue.</P>
<P>Yet there were moments of anxiety, in which I feared the con&s;equences of indulging this at|tachment. My own &s;ituation, the &s;ituation of JULIA, the pride of her father, the pride which it was proper for her&s;elf to feel: All the&s;e were pre&s;ent to my view, and &s;hewed me how little I could build on hope; yet it cheated me, I know not how, and I dreamed from day to day, of ble&s;&s;ings, which every day's reflection told me were not to be looked for.</P>
<P>There was, indeed &s;omething in the &s;cene a|round us, formed to create tho&s;e romantic il|lu&s;ions. The retreat of Roubign&eacute; is a venerable pile, the remains of ancient Gothic magnificence, and the grounds adjoining to it are in that &s;tile of melancholy grandeur, which marks the dwellings of our forefathers. One part of that &s;mall e&s;tate, which is &s;till the appendage of this once-re&s;pect|able man&s;ion, is a wild and rocky dell, where ta&s;te|le&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="017578_0128_0FBA703E5E696298">
wealth has never warred on nature, nor even elegance refined or embelli&s;hed her beauties. The walks are only worn by the tread of the &s;hepherds, and the banks only &s;moothed by the feeding of their &s;tocks. There, too dangerous &s;ociety! have I pa&s;&s;ed whole days with JULIA: There, more dangerous &s;till! have I pa&s;&s;ed whole days in thinking of her.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance, trifling in it&s;elf, added not a little to the fa&s;cination of the re&s;t. The &s;ame good woman who nur&s;ed me was al&s;o the nur&s;e of JULIA. She was too fond of her fo&s;ter-daughter, and too well treated by her, ever to leave the for|tunes of her family. To this re&s;idence &s;he at|tended them when they left <HI>Belville,</HI> and here too, as at that place, had a &s;mall hou&s;e and gar|den allotted her. It was &s;ituated at the extreme verge of that dell I have de&s;cribed, and was often the end of tho&s;e walks we took through it together. The good La&s;une, for that is our nur&s;e's name, con&s;idered us her children, and treated us, in tho&s;e vi&s;its to her little dwelling, with that &s;implicity of affection, which has the mo&s;t powerful effect on hearts of &s;en&s;ibility. Oh! Beauvaris! methinks I &s;ee the figure of La&s;une, at this moment, pointing out to your friend, with rapture in her countenance, the beauties of

her lovely daughter! She places our &s;eats to|gether; &s;he produces her &s;hining platters, with fruit and milk, for our repa&s;t; &s;he pre&s;&s;es the &s;miling JULIA, and will not be denied by Savil|lon!&mdash;Am I then a thou&s;and leagues di&s;tant?</P>
<P>Does JULIA remember Savillon?&mdash;Should I hope that &s;he does? My friend, I will confe&s;s my weakne&s;s; perhaps, it is wor&s;e than weakne&s;s; I have wi&s;hed&mdash;I have hoped, that I am not indifferent to her. Often have I been on the point of unloading my throbbing heart, of tel|ling her how pa&s;&s;ionately I loved, of a&s;king her forgivene&s;s for my pre&s;umption. I have thought, perhaps, it was vanity, that at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons &s;he might have an&s;wered and ble&s;&s;ed me; but I &s;aw the con&s;equences which would follow to both, and had fortitude enough to re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;e.&mdash;A time may come, when better fortune &s;hall en|title me to &s;peak; when the pride of Roubign&eacute; may not blu&s;h to look on Savillon as his &s;on.</P>
<P>But this is the language of vi&s;ionary hope! In the mean time, I am torn from her, from <HI>France,</HI> from every connection my heart had formed; ca&s;t, like a &s;hip wrecked thing, on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic, amid&s;t a de&s;ert, of all others, the mo&s;t dreadful, the de&s;ert of &s;ociety, with which no &s;ocial tie unites me!

I could not bear the formality of parting, and &s;tole from his hou&s;e by day-break. As I pa&s;&s;ed that hall, the door was open; I entered to take one la&s;t look, and bid it adieu! I had &s;at in it with JULIA the night before; the chairs we had oc|cupied were &s;till in their places; you know not, my friend, what I felt at the &s;ight: There was &s;omething in the &s;ilent attitude of tho&s;e very chairs, that wrung my heart beyond the power of language; and I believe, the &s;ervant had told me that my hor&s;es waited, five or &s;ix times over, before I could li&s;ten to what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>A gentleman has &s;ent to a&s;k, if my name is Savillon: If it is, he de&s;ires his compliments, and will do him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of waiting of me. I &s;tarted to hear my name thus a&s;ked for in <HI>Martinique.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. SAVILLON TO BEAUVARIS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now a week &s;ince I reached my uncle's, during all which time I have been &s;o much occupied in an&s;wering que&s;tions to the curio&s;ity of others, or a&s;king que&s;tions for the &s;atisfaction of my own, that I have &s;carce had a moment left for any other employment.</P>
<P>I have now &s;eized the opportunity of the re&s;t of the family being &s;till a-bed, to write to you on ac|count of this uncle, of him under who&s;e pro|tection I am to ri&s;e into life, under who&s;e guidance I am to thrid the mazes of the world. I fear I am unfit for the ta&s;k: I mu&s;t unlearn feelings in which I have long been accu&s;tomed to delight: I mu&s;t accommodate &s;entiment to conveniency, pride to intere&s;t, and &s;ometimes even virtue it&s;elf to fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>But is all this ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary?&mdash;I hate to believe it. I have been frequently told &s;o indeed, but my authorities are drawn either from men who have never entered the &s;cene at all, or en|tered
<PB N="12" REF="017578_0133_0FBA704950560D78">
it, re&s;olved to be overcome, without the trouble of re&s;i&s;tance. To think too meanly of mankind is dangerous to our reverence of virtue.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that in the&s;e wealthy i&s;lands, profit is the only medium of opinion, and that morality has nothing to do in the &s;y&s;tem; but I cannot ea&s;ily imagine that, in any latitude, the bo&s;om is &s;hut to tho&s;e plea&s;ures which re&s;ult from the exerci&s;e of goodne&s;s, or that hone&s;ty &s;hould be always &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful as to have the &s;neer of the million again&s;t it. Men will not be depraved beyond the per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ome motive, and &s;elf|intere&s;t will often be the parent of &s;ocial ob|ligation.</P>
<P>My uncle is better fitted for judging of this que&s;tion; he is cool enough to judge of it from experience, without being mi&s;led by feeling.&mdash;He believes there are many more hone&s;t dealings than hone&s;t men, but that there are more hone&s;t men than knaves every where; that common &s;en&s;e will keep them &s;o, even exclu&s;ive of prin|ciple; but that all may be vanqui&s;hed by adequate temptation.</P>
<P>With a competent &s;hare of plain u&s;eful parts, and a certain &s;teady application of mind, he en|tered into commerce at an early period of life.
<PB N="13" REF="017578_0134_0FBA704A660A7EB0">
Not apt to be &s;educed by the glare of great ap|parent advantage, nor ea&s;ily intimidated from his purpo&s;es by accidental di&s;appointment, he has held on, with &s;ome vici&s;&s;itude of fortune, but with uniform equality of temper, till, in virtue of his abilities, his diligence and his ob&s;ervation, he has acquired very con&s;iderable wealth. He &s;till, however, continues the labour of the race, though he has already reached the goal; not be|cau&s;e he is covetous of greater riches, but becau&s;e the indu&s;try, by which greater riches are acquired, is grown nece&s;&s;ary to his enjoyment of life. "I have been long, &s;aid he ye&s;terday, a very happy man; having has a little le&s;s time, and a little more money, than I know what to make of."</P>
<P>The opinion of the world he tru&s;ts but little, in his judgment of others; of men's actions he &s;peaks with caution, either in prai&s;e or blame, and is commonly mo&s;t &s;ceptical, when tho&s;e a|round him are mo&s;t convinced: For it is a maxim with him, in que&s;tions of character, to doubt a &s;trong evidence, from the very circum&s;tances of its &s;trength.</P>
<P>With regard to him&s;elf, however, he accepts of the common opinion, as a &s;ort of coin, which pa&s;&s;es current, though it is not always real, and often &s;eems to yield up the conviction of his own
<PB N="14" REF="017578_0135_0FBA704ED7E33FE8">
mind in compliance to the general voice. Ever aver&s;e to &s;plendid project in action or &s;plendid conjecture in argument, he contents him&s;elf with walking in the beaten track of things, and does not even venture to leave it, though he may, now and then, ob&s;erve it making &s;mall deviations from rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. He has &s;ometimes, &s;ince our acquaintance began, tapped me on the &s;houl|der, in the mid&s;t of &s;ome &s;entiment I was uttering, and told me with a &s;mile, that the&s;e were fine words, and did very well in the mouth of a young man. Yet he &s;eems not di&s;plea&s;ed with my feeling what him&s;elf does not feel; and looks on me with the more favourable eye, that I have &s;omething about me for experience and ob&s;er|vation to prune.</P>
<P>His plan of dome&s;tic economy is regular, but nobody is di&s;turbed by its regularity; for he is perfectly free from that rigid attention to method, which one frequently &s;ees in the hou&s;es of old batchelors. He has &s;en&s;e, or <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> enough, not to be troubled with little di&s;arrangements, and bears, with wonderful complacency, and con&s;equently with great ea&s;e to gue&s;ts, tho&s;e ac|cidents which di&s;turb the peace of other entertain|ments. Since my arrival we have had every day &s;omething like a fea&s;t, probably from a &s;ort of compliment which his friends meant to pay to
<PB N="15" REF="017578_0136_0FBA704FFAFE4798">
him and to me; but at his table, in its mo&s;t ele|vated &s;tyle, the government is nearly republican; he a&s;&s;umes very little, either of the trouble, or the dignity of a landlord, &s;atisfied with giving a general a&s;&s;urance of welcome and good-humour in his a&s;pect.</P>
<P>At one of tho&s;e dinners was a neighbour and intimate acquaintance of my uncle, a Mr. Dor|ville, with his wife and daughter. The young lady was &s;eated next me, and my uncle &s;eemed to incline that I &s;hould be particularly plea&s;ed with her. He addre&s;&s;ed &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e to her as might draw her forth to the greate&s;t advantage; and, as he had heard me profe&s;s my&s;elf as lover of mu&s;ic, he made her &s;ing, after dinner, till, I believe, &s;ome of the company began to be tired of their entertainment. After they were gone, he a&s;ked my opinion of Mademoi&s;elle Dorville, in that particular &s;tyle by which a man gives you to un|der&s;tand, that his own is a very favourable one. To &s;ay truth, the lady's appearance is in her fa|vour; but there is a jealous &s;ort of feeling, which ari&s;es in my mind, when I hear the prai&s;es of any woman but one; and, from that cau&s;e perhaps, I an&s;wered my uncle rather coldly. I &s;aw he thought &s;o, from the reply he made; I offered &s;ome awkward apology; he &s;miled, and &s;aid, I
<PB N="16" REF="017578_0137_0FBA70514D0A2280">
was a philo&s;opher. Alas! he knows not how little claim I have to philo&s;ophy in that way; if, indeed, we are &s;o often to profane that word, by affixing to it the idea of in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>To-day I begin bu&s;ine&s;s. My uncle and I are to view his different plantations, and he is to &s;hew me, in general, the province he means to allot me. I wi&s;h for an opportunity to be a&s;&s;iduous in his &s;ervice: Till I can do &s;omething on my part, his favours are debts upon me. It is only to a friend, like my Beauvaris, that one feels a plea|&s;ure in being obliged.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. SAVILLON TO BEAUVARIS.</HEAD>
<P>A THOUSAND thanks for your la&s;t let|ter. When you know how much I enjoyed the unwieldy appearance of the packet, with my friend's hand on the back of it, you will not grudge the time it co&s;t you. It is ju&s;t &s;uch as I wi&s;hed: Your &s;cene-painting is delightful. No man is more &s;u&s;ceptible of local attachments than I; and, with the Atlantic between, there is not a &s;tone in <HI>France,</HI> which I can remember with in|difference.</P>
<P>Yet I am happier here than I could venture to expect. Had I been left to my own choice, I &s;hould probably have &s;at down in &s;olitude, to think of the pa&s;t, and enjoy my reflections; but I have been forced to do better. There is an active duty, which rewards every man in the per|formance; and my uncle has &s;o contrived mat|ters, that I have had very little time unemployed. He has been liberal of in&s;truction, and, I hope, has found me willing to be in&s;tructed. Our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is, indeed, is not very intricate; but in the &s;imple&s;t occupations, there are a thou&s;and little

circum&s;tances, which experience alone can teach us. In certain departments, however, I have tried projects of my own: Some of them have failed in the end, but all gave me plea&s;ure in the pur&s;uit. In one I have been &s;ucce&s;sful beyond expectation; and in that one I was the mo&s;t deep|ly intere&s;ted, becau&s;e it touched the cau&s;e of hu|manity.</P>
<P>To a man not callous from habit, the treat|ment of the negroes, in the plantations here, is &s;hocking. I felt it &s;trongly, and could not for|bear expre&s;&s;ing my &s;entiments to my uncle. He allowed them to be natural, but pleaded nece&s;&s;ity, in ju&s;tification of tho&s;e &s;everities, which his over|&s;eers &s;ometimes u&s;ed towards his &s;laves. I ven|tured to doubt this propo&s;ition, and begged he would &s;uffer me to try a different mode of go|vernment in one plantation, the produce of which he had already allotted to my management. He con&s;ented, though with the belief that I &s;hould &s;ucceed very ill in the experiment.</P>
<P>I began by endeavouring to ingratiate my&s;elf with &s;uch of the &s;laves as could be&s;t &s;peak the language of my country; but I found this was a manner they did not under&s;tand, and that, from a white, the appearance of indulgence carried the &s;u&s;picion of treachery. Mo&s;t of them, to whom

&s;uffered it to drop to its former po&s;ture. "Can this man have been a prince in Africa?" &s;aid I to my|&s;elf.&mdash;I reflected for a moment.&mdash;"Yet what &s;hould he now do, if he has?&mdash;Ju&s;t what I &s;ee him do. I have &s;een a depo&s;ed-&s;overeign at <HI>Pa|ris;</HI> but in Europe, kings are artificial beings, like their &s;ubjects.&mdash;Silence is the only throne which adver&s;ity has left to princes."</P>
<P>"I fear, (&s;aid I to him) you have been &s;ome|times treated <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by the over&s;een; but you &s;hall be treated &s;o no more: I wi&s;h all my people to be happy." He looked on me now for the fir&s;t time.&mdash;"Can you &s;peak my language, or &s;hall I call for &s;ome of your friends who can explain what you would &s;ay to me?&mdash;"I &s;peak no &s;ay to you," he replied in his broken French.&mdash;"And you will not be my friend?"&mdash;"No."&mdash;"Even if I &s;hould de&s;erve it."&mdash;"You a white man."&mdash;I felt the rebuke as I ought.&mdash;"But all white men are not over&s;eers. What &s;hall I do to make you think me a good man?&mdash;U&s;e men goodly."&mdash;I mean to do &s;o, and you among the fir&s;t, Yambu."&mdash;"Be good for Yambu's people; do your plea&s;e with Yambu."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then the bell rung as a &s;ummons for the negroes to go to work: He made a few &s;teps to|wards
<PB N="22" REF="017578_0141_0FBA705A25CD3F00">
the door. "Would you now go to work (&s;aid I) if you were at liberty to avoid it?&mdash;"You make go for whip, and no man love go."&mdash;"I will go along with you, though I am not obliged; for I chu&s;e to work &s;ometimes, rather than be idle."&mdash;"Chu&s;e work, no work at all, &s;aid Yambu.&mdash;'Twas the very principle on which my &s;y&s;tem was founded.</P>
<P>I took him with me into the hou&s;e when our ta&s;k was over. "I wrought chu&s;e-work (&s;aid I) Yambu, yet I did le&s;s than you?"&mdash;"Yambu do chu&s;e-work then too?"&mdash;You &s;hall do &s;o al|ways, an&s;wered I: From this moment you are mine no more!"&mdash;"You &s;ell me other white men then? No, you are free, and may do what|ever you plea&s;e!&mdash;Yambu's plea&s;e no here, no this country?" he replied, waving his hand, and looking wi&s;tfully towards the &s;ea.&mdash;"I can not give you back your country, Yambu; but I can make this one better for you. You can make it better for me too, and for your people!"&mdash;"Speak Yambu that (&s;aid he eagerly) and be good man!"&mdash;"You would not (&s;aid I) make your people work by the whip, as you &s;ee the over&s;eers do?"&mdash;"Oh! no, no whip!"&mdash;Yet they mu&s;t work, el&s;e we &s;hall have no &s;ugars to buy them meat and clothing with,"&mdash;(He put his hand to his brow, as if I had &s;tarted

a difficulty he was unable to overcome.)&mdash;"Then you &s;hall have the command of them, and they &s;hall work chu&s;e-work for Yambu,"&mdash;He looked a&s;kance, as if he doubted the truth of what I &s;aid; I called the negroe with whom I had the fir&s;t conver&s;ation about him, and pointing to Yambu, "Your ma&s;ter (&s;aid I) is now free, and may leave you when he plea&s;es!"&mdash;Yambu no leave you," &s;aid he to the negroe warmly.&mdash;"But he may accompany Yambu if he chu&s;es."&mdash;Yambu &s;hook his head.&mdash;"Ma&s;ter, (&s;aid his for|mer &s;ubject) where we go? leave good white man, and go to bad; for much bad white men in this country."&mdash;Then if you think it better, you &s;hall both &s;tay; Yambu &s;hall be my friend and help me to rai&s;e &s;ugars for the good of us all: You &s;hall have no over&s;eer but Yambu, and &s;hall work no more than he bids you?&mdash;The ne|groe fell at my feet and ki&s;&s;ed them: Yambu &s;tood &s;ilent and I &s;aw a tear on his cheek.&mdash;"This man has been a prince in Africa!" &s;aid I to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I did not mean to deceive them. Next morn|ing I called tho&s;e negroes who had formerly been in his &s;ervice together, and told them that, while they continued in the plantation, Yambu was to &s;uperintend their work; that, if they cho&s;e to leave him and me, they were at liberty to go;
<PB N="24" REF="017578_0143_0FBA705F679433C0">

He has, accordingly, ever &s;ince had the command of his former &s;ub|jects, and &s;uperintended their work in a particu|lar quarter of the plantation; and, having been declared free, according to the mode pre&s;cribed by the laws of the i&s;land, has a certain portion of ground allotted him, the produce of which is his property. I have had the &s;atisfaction of ob|&s;erving tho&s;e men under the feeling of good treat|ment, and the idea of liberty, do more than al|mo&s;t double their number &s;ubject to the whip of an over&s;eer.

<P>I have been often tempted to doubt whether there is not an error in the whole plan to negro &s;ervitude, and whether whites, or creoles born in the We&s;t-Indies, or perhaps cattle, after the man|ner of European hu&s;bandry, would not do the bu&s;ine&s;s better and cheaper than the &s;laves do. The money which the latter co&s;t at fir&s;t, the &s;ick|ne&s;s (often owing to de&s;pondency of mind) to which they are liable after their arrival, and the proportion that die in con&s;equence of it, make the machine, if it may be &s;o called, of a plan|tation extremely expen&s;ive in its operations.

<P>Forgive the warmth of this apo&s;trophe: Here it would not be under&s;tood; even my uncle, who&s;e heart is far from a hard one, would &s;mile at my romance, and tell me that things mu&s;t be &s;o.

<P>SINCE the date of my la&s;t is a longer period than you allow between my letters; but my time has been more than commonly occupied of late. Among other employments was that of acquiring a friend. Be not however, jea|lous: My heart cannot own a &s;econd in the &s;ame degree with Beauvaris; yet is this one above the level of ordinary men. He enjoys al&s;o that pri|vilege
<PB N="28" REF="017578_0147_0FBA7067A370AD78">
which misfortune be&s;tows on the virtuous.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e, with whom my uncle's exten&s;ive dealings have connected him, he had mentioned with particular commendation, one Herbert, an Engli&s;hman, a merchant in one of the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India I&s;lands. Chance brought him lately to <HI>Martinique,</HI> and I was &s;olicitous to &s;hew every po&s;&s;ible civility to one, who, to the claim of a &s;tranger, added the character of a worthy and amiable man. Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as I was in his favour, my expectations fell &s;hort of the reality. I di&s;|covered in him a delicacy and finene&s;s of &s;enti|ment, which &s;omething beyond the education of a trader mu&s;t have in&s;pired; and I looked on him perhaps with the greater reverence, from the circum&s;tance of having found him in a &s;tation where I did not expect he would be found. On a clo&s;er inve&s;tigation, I preceived tincture of melancholy enthu&s;ia&s;m, in his mind, which, I was per&s;uaded, was not altogether owing to the na|tional character, but mu&s;t have ari&s;en from &s;ome particular cau&s;e. This increa&s;ed my regard for him; and I could not help expre&s;&s;ing it in the very &s;tyle which was &s;uited to its object, a quiet and &s;till attention, &s;ympathetic but not intru&s;ive. He &s;eemed to take notice of my behaviour, and looked as if he had found a per&s;on, who gue&s;&s;ed him to be unhappy, and to whom he could talk
<PB N="29" REF="017578_0148_0FBA70692706B900">
of his unhappine&s;s. I encouraged the idea with that diffidence, which I believe, is of all manners the mo&s;t intimate with a mind of the &s;ort I have de&s;cribed; and, &s;oon after, he took an opportu|nity of telling me the &s;tory of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>It was &s;imple, but not the le&s;s pathetic. In|heriting a con&s;iderable fortune from his father, he &s;et out in trade with every advantage. Soon after he was &s;ettled in bu&s;ine&s;s, he married a beau|tiful and excellent woman, for whom, from his infancy, he had conceived the tendere&s;t attach|ment; and, about a year after their marriage, &s;he ble&s;&s;ed him with a &s;on. But love and fortune did not long continue to &s;mile upon him. Lo&s;&s;es in trade, to which, though benevolence like his be more expo&s;ed, the mo&s;t prudent and unfeeling are liable, reduced him, from his former affluence, to very embarra&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances; and his di&s;tre&s;s was aggravated from the con&s;ideration, that he did not &s;uffer alone, but communicated misfor|tune to a woman he pa&s;&s;ionately loved. Some very con&s;iderable debts remained due to him in the We&s;t-Indies, and he found it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, for their recovery, to repair thither him|&s;elf, however terrible might be a &s;eparation from his wife, now in a &s;ituation of all others the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible. They parted, and &s;he was, &s;oon af|ter,
<PB N="30" REF="017578_0149_0FBA706E293CB788">
delivered of a girl, who&s;e promi&s;ing appear|ance, as well as that of her brother, was &s;ome con&s;olation for the ab&s;ence of their father.</P>
<P>His ab&s;ence, though cruel, was nece&s;&s;ary and he found his affairs in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that it promi&s;ed not to be long. Day after day, how|ever, elap&s;ed, without their final &s;ettlement. The impatience both of his wife and him was increa&s;ed, by the appearance of a conclu&s;ion, which &s;o repeatedly di&s;appointed them; till, at la&s;t he ventured to &s;ugge&s;t, and &s;he warmly ap|proved, the expedient of coming out to a hu&s;|band, who&s;e circum&s;tances prevented him from meeting her at home. She &s;et &s;ail with her chil|dren; but wife nor children ever reached the un|fortunate Herbert! They peri&s;hed in a &s;torm &s;oon after their departure from England.</P>
<P>You can judge of the feelings of a man, who upbraided him&s;elf as their murderer. An inter|val of madne&s;s, he informed me, &s;ucceeded the account he received of their death. When his rea&s;on returned, it &s;ettled into a melancholy, which time has &s;oothed, not extingui&s;hed, which indeed &s;eems to have become the habitual tone of his mind. Yet is it gentle, though deep, in its effects; it di&s;turbs not the circle of &s;ociety around him, and few, except &s;uch as are formed to di&s;|cover
<PB N="31" REF="017578_0150_0FBA706FED4CFC20">
and to pity it, ob&s;erve any thing peculiar in his behaviour. But he holds it not the le&s;s &s;acred to him&s;elf; and often retires from the company of tho&s;e, whom he has entertained with the good humour of a well-bred man, to arrange the me|morials of his much loved Emily, and call up the &s;ad remembrance of his former joys.</P>
<P>Having acquired a &s;ort of privilege with his di&s;tre&s;s, from my acquaintance with its cau&s;e, I entered his room ye&s;terday, when he had thus &s;hut out the world, and found him with &s;ome let|ters on the table before him, on which he looked, with a tear, not of angui&s;h, but of tenderne&s;s. I &s;topped &s;hort on perceiving him thus employed; he &s;eemed unable to &s;peak, but making a move|ment, as if he de&s;ired that I &s;hould come forward, put two of tho&s;e letters &s;ucce&s;&s;ively into my hand. They were written by his wife: The fir&s;t, &s;oon after their marriage. When &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s had called him away from her into the country; and the &s;econd, addre&s;&s;ed to him in the We&s;t-Indies, where, by that time, their ill-fortune had driven him. They plea&s;ed me &s;o much, that I a&s;ked his leave to keep them for a day or two. He would not ab&s;olutely refu&s;e me; but &s;aid they had never been out of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I pre&s;&s;ed him no fur|ther: I could only read them over repeatedly, and &s;ome parts, that &s;truck mo&s;t forcibly on my

memory, which you know is pretty tenacious, I can recollect almo&s;t <HI>verbatim.</HI> To another, it might &s;eem odd to write &s;uch things as the&s;e; but my Beauvaris is never inattentive to the language of nature, or the voice of misfortune.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t letter were the following expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<Q><P>You know not what feelings are here, at thus, for the fir&s;t time, writing to my Henry under the name of a hu&s;band.&mdash;A mixture of tenderne&s;s, of love, of e&s;teem, and confi|dence. A &s;omething, never experienced be|fore, is &s;o warm in my heart, that &s;ure it is, at this moment, more worthy of his love than ever.&mdash;Shall not this la&s;t, my Harry, not|with&s;tanding what I have heard from the &s;cof|fers among you men? I think it &s;hall. It is not a tumultuous tran&s;port, that mu&s;t &s;uddenly di&s;appear; but the &s;oft, &s;till plea&s;ure of a hap|py mind, that can feel its happine&s;s, and de|light in its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I have had little company &s;ince you left me, and I wi&s;h not for much. The idea of my Henry is my be&s;t companion. I have figured out your journey, your company, and your bu&s;ine&s;s, and filled up my hours with the pic|ture of what they are to you.</P></Q>

<P>John has ju&s;t taken away my chicken: You know he takes liberties.&mdash;"Dear heart, a leg and wing only.&mdash;Betty &s;ays, Madam, the chee&s;ecakes are excellent."&mdash;I &s;miled at John's manner of pre&s;&s;ing, and helped my|&s;elf to a chee&s;ecake. The poor fellow looked &s;o happy&mdash;"My ma&s;ter will &s;oon return," &s;aid he, by way of accounting for my puny dinner. He &s;et the wine upon the table: I filled out half a gla&s;s, and began to think of you; but, in carrying it to my lips, I reproach|ed my&s;elf that it was not a bumper: That was remedied as it &s;hould be. John, I believe, gue&s;&s;ed at the correction.&mdash;"God ble&s;s him!" I heard him &s;ay, muttering as he put up the things in his ba&s;ket.&mdash;I &s;ent him down with the re&s;t of the bottle, and they are now drinking your health in the Kitchen.</P></Q>
<Q><P>My cou&s;in Harriet has come in to &s;ee me, and is going on with the cap I was making up, while I write this by her. She is a better milliner than I, and would have altered it &s;omewhat; but I &s;tuck to my own way, for I heard you &s;ay you liked it in that &s;hape.&mdash;"It is not half &s;o fa&s;hionable, indeed, my dear," &s;aid Harriot; but &s;he does not know

<P>Of the other letter, I recollect &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<Q><P>Captain Lew&s;on has ju&s;t now been with me, but has brought no letter; and gives for rea&s;on, your having written by a &s;hip that left the i&s;land but a few days before him, meaning the Triton, by which I got your la&s;t; but I beg to hear from you by every opportunity, e&s;pecially by &s;o friendly a hand as Lew&s;on; it would en|dear a man, to whom I have rea&s;on to be grateful, much more to me, that he brought a few lines from you. Think, my deare&s;t Harry, that hearing from you is all that your Emily has now to expect, at lea&s;t for a long, long time.</P>
<P>Perhaps, (as you &s;ometimes told me, in former days, when, alas! we only talked of misfortunes) we always think our pre&s;ent ca|lamity

the bittere&s;t; yet, methinks, our &s;e|paration is the only evil, for which I could not have found a comfort. In truth, we were not unhappy: Health and &s;trength were left us: We could have done much for one another, and for our dear little ones. I fear, my love, you thought of me le&s;s nobly, than I hope I de&s;erved: I was not to be &s;hocked by any re|trenchment from our former way of living: I could have borne even the hard&s;hips of poverty, had it left me my Harry.</P></Q>
<Q><P>Your &s;weetmeats arrived very &s;afe under the care of Captain Lew&s;on: The children have profited by them, particularly Billy, who has &s;till &s;ome remains of the hooping-cough.

<P>Emmy, they tell me, will be a beauty. She has, to &s;ay truth, lovely dark blue eyes and a charming complexion. I think there is &s;omething of melancholy in her look; but this may be only my fancy. Billy is quite dif|ferent, a bold &s;pirited child; yet he is re|markably attentive to every thing I endeavour to teach him, and can read a little already, with no other tutor than my&s;elf. I cho&s;e this ta&s;k, to amu&s;e my lonely hours; for I make it a point of duty, to keep up my &s;pirits as well as I can.

<P>It is &s;omething to endeavour to comfort him. 'Tis perhaps a &s;elfi&s;h movement in our nature, to conceive an attachment to &s;uch a character; one that throws it&s;elf on our pity by feeling its di|&s;tre&s;&s;es, is ever more beloved than that which ri&s;es above them.&mdash;I know, however, without far|ther enquiry, that I feel my&s;elf plea&s;ed with being the friend of Herbert; would we were in <HI>France,</HI> that I might make him the friend of Beauvaris!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXX. SAVILLON TO BEAUVARIS.</HEAD>
<P>I BEGIN to &s;u&s;pect that the &s;en&s;ibility, of which your minds are proud, from which they look down with contempt on the unfeeling mul|titude of ordinary men, is le&s;s a ble&s;&s;ing than an inconvenience.&mdash;Why cannot I be as happy as my uncle, as Dorville, as all the other good people around me?&mdash;I eat, and drink, and &s;ing, nay I can be merry, like them; but they clo&s;e the account, and &s;et down this mirth for happine&s;s; I retire to the family of my own thoughts, and find them in weeds of &s;orrow.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="017578_0158_0FBA7081342A6690">
Herbert left this place ye&s;terday! the only man be&s;ides thee, whom my &s;oul can acknowledge as a friend. And him perhaps, I &s;hall &s;ee no more: And thee! my heart droops at this moment, and I could weep without knowing why.&mdash;Tell me, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, that you are well and happy; there is, methinks, a languor in your la&s;t letter&mdash;or is it but the livery of my own imagination, which the objects around me are con&s;trained to wear?</P>
<P>Herbert was a &s;ort of proxy for my Beauvaris; he &s;poke from the feelings of a heart like his. To him I could unbo&s;om mine, and be under|&s;tood; for the &s;peaking of a common language, is but one requi&s;ite towards the deare&s;t intercour&s;e of &s;ociety. His &s;orrows gave him a &s;acredne&s;s in my regard, that made every endeavour to &s;erve or oblige him, like the performance of a religious duty; there was a quiet &s;atisfaction in it, which calmed the rufflings of a &s;ometimes troubled &s;pirit, and re&s;tored me to peace with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He is &s;ailed for England, whither &s;ome bu|&s;ine&s;s material to a friend of his much loved Emily, obliges him to return. He yields to this, I perceive, as a duty he thinks him&s;elf bound to di&s;charge, though the &s;ight of his native country, &s;poiled as it is of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which it once

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for him, mu&s;t be no ea&s;y trial of his fortitude. He talks of leaving it as &s;oon as this affair will allow him, not to return to the We&s;t|Indies (for of his bu&s;ine&s;s there he is now inde|pendent) but to travel through &s;ome parts of Europe, which the employments of his younger years prevented him from vi&s;iting at an early period of life. If he goes to <HI>Paris</HI> he has pro|mi&s;ed me to call on you.&mdash;Could I be with you!&mdash;What a thought is there!&mdash;but I &s;hall not be forgotten at the interview.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received yours of the third of la&s;t month. I mu&s;t &s;till complain of its &s;hortne&s;s, though I dare not quarrel with it as it a&s;&s;ures me of your welfare. But get rid, I pray you, of that very bad practice, of &s;uppo&s;ing things unimportant at <HI>Martinique,</HI> becau&s;e you think them &s;o at <HI>Paris.</HI> Give me your intelligence, and allow me to be the judge of its con&s;equence.</P>
<P>You are partial to your friend, when you write in &s;uch high terms, of his treatment of Yambu. We think but &s;eldom of tho&s;e things which habit has made common, otherwi&s;e we &s;hould correct many of them; there needed only to give one's feelings room on this theme, and

they could prompt no other conduct than mine. Your approbation, however, is not lo&s;t upon me; the be&s;t of our re&s;olutions are bettered, by a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;uffrage of good men in their favour; and the reward is &s;till higher, when that &s;uffrage is from tho&s;e we love.</P>
<P>My uncle has &s;ent for me, to help him to en|tertain &s;ome company who are ju&s;t arrived here.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. SAVILLON TO BEAUVARIS.</HEAD>
<P>YOU &s;ay the letter, to which your la&s;t was an an&s;wer, was written in low &s;pirits; I confe&s;s I am not always in high ones; not even now, though I am ju&s;t returned from a little fea&s;t, where there was much mirth, and excellent wine. It was a dinner given by Dorville, on occa&s;ion of his daughter's birth-day, to which my uncle and I, among other of his friends, had been long invited. The old gentleman di&s;played all his wealth, and all his wit, in entertaining us; &s;ome of us thanked him for neither, though every one's complai&s;ance obliged them to eat of his dainties, and laugh at his je&s;ts.</P>
<P>It is after &s;uch a &s;cene, that one is often in a &s;tate the mo&s;t &s;tupid of any. The a&s;&s;umption of a character, in it&s;elf humiliating, di&s;tre&s;&s;es and wa&s;tes us, while the lo&s;s of &s;o much time, like the bad fortune of a game&s;ter, is doubly felt, when we reflect that fools have won from us. Yet it mu&s;t be &s;o in life, and I wi&s;h to overcome the &s;pleen of repining at it.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="017578_0162_0FBA708A27F629E0">
I was again &s;et next Mademoi&s;elle Dorville, and had the honour of accompanying &s;ome of the &s;ongs &s;he &s;ung to us. A vain fellow, in my circum&s;tances, might imagine that girl liked him. I believe there is nothing &s;o &s;erious in her mind, and I &s;hould be &s;orry there were. The theft of a woman's affections is not &s;o atrocious as that of her honour; but I have often &s;een it more terrible than that of her life; at lea&s;t, if living wretch|edne&s;s be wor&s;e than death: Yet is it reckoned a very venial breach of confidence, to endeavour to become more than agreeable, where a man feels it impo&s;&s;ible to repay what he may receive. Her father I am apt to believe, has &s;omething of what is commonly called a plot upon me; but as to him my con&s;cience is ea&s;y, becau&s;e, the coffers of my uncle being his quarry, it matters not much if he is di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>Were it not from a point of delicacy, not to run the &s;malle&s;t ri&s;k of being thought particular, I could, &s;ometimes, be very well entertained with the &s;ociety of Mademoi&s;elle Dorville. There is a &s;prightline&s;s about her, which amu&s;es, though it is not winning, and I ever found it &s;o ea&s;y to talk non&s;en&s;e to any other woman. I fancy this is always the ca&s;e, where there is no chance of
<PB N="44" REF="017578_0163_0FBA708BCDC1B2B0">
the heart being intere&s;ted: It is perfectly &s;o in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance with me.&mdash;Oh! Beauvaris! I have laid out more &s;oul in &s;itting five minutes with JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute; in &s;ilence, than I &s;hould in a year's conver&s;ation with this little Dorville.</P>
<P>The Conver&s;ation of women has perhaps a charm from its weakne&s;s; but this mu&s;t be, like all their other weakne&s;&s;es that plea&s;e us, what claims an intere&s;t in our affections, without of|fending our rea&s;on. I know not if there is really a &s;ex in the &s;oul: Cu&s;tom and education have e&s;tabli&s;hed one, in our idea; but we wi&s;h to feel the inferiority of the other &s;ex, as one that does not deba&s;e but endear it.</P>
<P>To their knowledge, in many things, we have &s;et limits, becau&s;e it &s;eems to encroach on the &s;oftne&s;s of their feelings, which we &s;uppo&s;e of that retiring kind, that &s;huns the keenne&s;s of ar|gument or enquiry. Knowledge or learning has often this effect among men: It is even &s;ometimes fatal to ta&s;te, if by ta&s;te is meant the effect which beauties have on our&s;elves, rather than the power of critici&s;ing on that which they ought to have on others.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="017578_0164_0FBA70912DEC7840">
There is a little world of &s;entiment made for women to move in, where they certainly excel our &s;ex, and where our &s;ex, perhaps, ought to be excelled by them. This is irre&s;i&s;tibly engaging, where it is natural; but of all affectations, that of &s;entiment is the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting. It is, I be|lieve, more common in <HI>France</HI> than any where el&s;e; and I am not &s;ure, if it does not proceed from our women po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the reality le&s;s. The daughter of Mon&s;. Dorville, when &s;he would be great, is always &s;entimental. I was forced to tell her to-day, that I hated &s;entiments, and that they &s;poiled the complexion. She looked in the gla&s;s, and began to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions about the Italian comedy.</P>
<P>My uncle, who had &s;taid &s;ome time behind me with Dorville, came in. He was very copious on the &s;ubject of Mademoi&s;elle. I was perfectly of his opinion in every thing, and prai&s;ed her in echo to what he &s;aid, but he had di&s;cernment enough to &s;ee an indifference in this, which I was &s;orry to find he did not like. I know not how far he meant to go, if we had been long together; but he found him&s;elf &s;omewhat indi&s;po&s;ed, and was obliged to go to bed.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="017578_0165_0FBA70926EEFEE20">
I &s;at down alone, and thought of JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute;.</P>
<P>My uncle is, this morning, really ill. I owe him too much, not to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at this. He is unea&s;y about his own &s;ituation, though, I be|lieve, without rea&s;on; but men, who like him, have enjoyed uninterrupted health, are apt to be apprehen&s;ive. I have &s;ent for a phy&s;ician with|out letting him know; for it was another effect of his good con&s;titution, to hold the faculty in contempt. At pre&s;ent, I am &s;ure, he will thank me, in his heart, for my precaution.</P>
<P>The doctor has been with him, and talks doubt|fully; that, perhaps, is unavoidable in a &s;cience, from its nature, &s;o uncertain; for this man has really too much knowledge to wi&s;h to &s;eem wi&s;er.</P>
<P>I find I mu&s;t conclude this letter, as the &s;hip, by which I am to &s;end it, is within a quarter of an hour of &s;ailing. Would it had been a few days later! a few days might do much in a fate like mine.&mdash;I cannot expre&s;s that &s;ort of doubt and fear which the look of futurity, at this mo|ment, gives me.</P>

Do not, for Heaven's &s;ake, do not fail to write me about the &s;ituation of Roubign&eacute; and his family.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. JULIA DE MONTAUBAN, TO MARIA DE RONCILLES.</HEAD>
<P>YOU mu&s;t not expect to hear from me &s;o often as formerly; we have, here, an even tenor of days, that admits not of much de|&s;cription. Comedies and romances, you know, always end with a marriage, becau&s;e after that, there is nothing to be &s;aid.</P>
<P>But I have rea&s;on to be angry with you for finding &s;o little to &s;ay at <HI>Paris,</HI> though I believe, the fault is in my&s;elf, or rather in your idea of me. You think I am not formed to reli&s;h tho&s;e articles of intelligence, which are called news in your great town; the truth is, I have often heard them with very little reli&s;h; but I know you have wit enough to make them plea&s;ant if you would; and even if you had not, do but write any thing, and I &s;hall read it with an intere&s;t.</P>
<P>You flatter me by your prai&s;es of the <HI>naivet&eacute;,</HI> in the picture I drew of our party of plea&s;ure. GOD knows, I have no talent that way; yet the groupe was fanta&s;tic enough, and, though I felt quite otherwi&s;e than merry next morning, when
<PB N="49" REF="017578_0168_0FBA709922F5D058">
I wrote to you, yet I found a &s;ort of plea&s;ure in de&s;cribing it. There is a certain kind of trifling, in which a mind not much at ea&s;e can &s;ometimes indulge it&s;elf. One feels an e&s;cape, as it were, from the heart, and is fain to take up with lighter company. It is like the theft of a truant boy, who goes to play for a few minutes while his ma|&s;ter is a&s;leep, and throws the chiding for his ta&s;k upon futurity.</P>
<P>We have very different company at pre&s;ent. Madame de Sancerre has been here the&s;e three days. Her hu&s;band was an acquaintance of Mon&s;. de Montauban in <HI>Spain,</HI> and, you will remember, we u&s;ed to be of her parties in town; &s;o &s;he is a gue&s;t of both &s;ides of the hou&s;e, though I believe no great favourite of either. She is a wit, you know, and &s;ays abundance of good things; and will &s;ay any thing, provided it be witty. Here, indeed, we give her &s;o little opportunity, that her genius is almo&s;t fami&s;hed for want of &s;ubject. At <HI>Paris,</HI> I remember her &s;urrounded with men of letters; they prai&s;ed her learning, and to us &s;he &s;eemed wonderful both as a &s;cholar and a critic; but here when I turn the di&s;cour&s;e on books, &s;he chu&s;es to talk of nothing but the <HI>beau monde.</HI> Her de&s;criptions, however, are diverting enough, and I believe &s;he is not the wor&s;e plea&s;ed with me, that I can only hear them without being
<PB N="50" REF="017578_0169_0FBA709AA389ABE8">
able to an&s;wer; for I think, if there is a member of our &s;ociety &s;he di&s;likes, it is that relation of the Count, whom I mentioned to you in my la&s;t, Mon&s;. de Rouill&eacute;, who is come to &s;pend &s;ome weeks here. From the account of his vivacity which I received from his kin&s;man, I thought Madame de Sancerre would have thought it a piece of high good fortune to have met him here; but, I &s;ee, I mi&s;took the thing; and that &s;he would reli&s;h his company better, if he were as &s;tupid as the re&s;t of us. I am of a different opinion, and begin to like him much; the better, that I was prepared to be &s;omewhat afraid of him; but I find in him nothing to be feared; on the contrary, he is my very &s;afe&s;t barrier again&s;t the &s;ometimes too powerful brilliancy of the lady.</P>
<P>Rouill&eacute; is con&s;titutionally happy; but his vi|vacity, though it &s;eems to be con&s;tant, does not appear to be unfeeling. It is not the cheerfulne&s;s of an unthinking man, who is ready to laugh, on all occa&s;ions, without leave of his rea&s;on, or what is wor&s;e, of his humanity; &s;ome &s;uch peo|ple I have &s;een, who&s;e mirth, was like the pranks of a madman, and, if not of con&s;equence enough to excite anger or fear, was entitled to our compa&s;&s;ion. Rouill&eacute; has the happy talent of hit|ting that point where &s;entiment mingles with good humour. His wit, except when forced in|to
<PB N="51" REF="017578_0170_0FBA709AA389ABE8">
to oppo&s;ition by the petulance of others, is ever of that gentle kind from which we have nothing to dread; that &s;ports it&s;elf in the level of or|dinary under&s;tandings, and plea&s;es, becau&s;e it makes no one di&s;plea&s;ed with him&s;elf. Even the natural gravity of Montauban yields to the win|ning liveline&s;s of Rouill&eacute;, and though the fir&s;t &s;eems to feel a little aukwardne&s;s in the attempt, yet he often comes down from the loftine&s;s of his own character, to meet the plea&s;antry of the other's.</P>
<P>Do not rally me on the favour of matrimony in the ob&s;ervation, if I venture to &s;ay, that Mon|tauban &s;eems to have re&s;umed &s;omewhat of his former dignity. Think not that I &s;u&s;pect the &s;malle&s;t diminution of his affection; but now, when the ea&s;e of the hu&s;band has re&s;tored him to his native character&mdash;I know not what I would &s;ay&mdash;Believe me, I mean nothing at all&mdash;I have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied and happy.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, I believe, he is now and then out of humour with this vi&s;itant of ours, Madame de Sancerre; and, it may be, thrown into &s;omewhat of a &s;everity in his manner, from the ob&s;ervation of an oppo&s;ite one in her. When &s;he utters, as &s;he does pretty often, any joke at which &s;he
<PB N="52" REF="017578_0171_0FBA709FE4FB4900">
laughs heartily her&s;elf, I laugh, &s;ometimes with good will, but oftener (out of complai&s;ance) without; Rouill&eacute; laughs, and is ready with his je&s;t in return; but Montauban looks graver than ever. Indeed, there is no re&s;ource for one who cannot laugh at a je&s;t, but to look grave at it.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h my MARIA could have accepted of the invitation he communicated by me &s;ome time ago. I think I &s;hould have &s;hewn him, in my friend, a liveline&s;s that would not have di&s;plea&s;ed him. Could you &s;till contrive to come, while Rouill&eacute; is here, you mu&s;t be charmed with one another. It would give me an opportunity of making up to you, for the many dull letters I have obliged you to read; but you taxed your&s;elf early with my corre&s;pondence; it was then, per|haps, tolerable; it has, of late, been a mere col|lection of egoti&s;ms, the egoti&s;ms too of a mind ill at ea&s;e&mdash;but I have given up making apologies or acknowledgements to you; they are only for common obligations: mine is a debt beyond their quittance.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</HEAD>
<P>I AM now three letters in your debt; yet the account of corre&s;pondence u&s;ed formerly to be in my favour. The truth is, that of facts I have nothing to write, and of &s;entiments almo&s;t as little. Of the fir&s;t, my &s;ituation here in the coun|try deprives me; and of the la&s;t, that quiet &s;ort of &s;tate I have got into is little productive. When I was unhappy as the lover of JULIA, or fir&s;t happy as her hu&s;band, I had theme enough, and to &s;pare. I can tell you, that I am happy &s;till; but it is a &s;ort of happine&s;s that would not figure in narration. I believe my JULIA is every thing that a good wife &s;hould be: I hope I am a good hu&s;band. I am neither young nor old e|nough for a doating one.</P>
<P>You will &s;mile and look back to certain letters and notes of mine, written &s;ome four or five months ago. I do not know why I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of them. Were Segarva to marry, he would write &s;uch letters for a while, and there never was a man who could write &s;uch letters
<PB N="54" REF="017578_0173_0FBA70A2E20BD9D0">
long. If there were, I am not &s;ure if I &s;hould wi&s;h to be that man. When we can|not be quite &s;o happy as others, our pride na|turally balances the account: It &s;hews us that we are wi&s;er.</P>
<P>Rouill&eacute;, who has been here for a week or two, is of a different opinion: He holds the happie&s;t man to be ever the wi&s;e&s;t. You know Rouill&eacute;'s di&s;po&s;ition, which was always too much in the &s;un for us; but the goodne&s;s of his heart, and the purity of his honour, are above the re&s;t of his cha|racter. With this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour, I hear him laugh at me, without re&s;entment; and by and by he &s;teals upon me, till I forget my&s;elf, and laugh with him. I am &s;ometimes gay; but I feel a &s;ort of trouble in gaiety. It is exactly the rever&s;e with Rouill&eacute;: He can be &s;erious, when he means to be &s;o; but, if we mean no|thing, he is gay, and I am &s;erious.</P>
<P>My wife is neither one nor t'other: There is &s;omething about her too gentle for either; but I think, her pen&s;ive &s;oftne&s;s de&s;erts more readily to Rouill&eacute;'s &s;ide than to mine, though one &s;hould imagine his manner the more di&s;tant from hers of the two. Rouill&eacute; jokes me on this: He calls her the middle &s;tage between us; but &s;ays, it is up|hill
<PB N="55" REF="017578_0174_0FBA70A7F52F99C0">
towards my &s;ide. "A &s;olitary ca&s;tle, and a &s;till evening (&s;aid he) would make a JULIA of me; but to be Montauban, I mu&s;t have a fog and a pri&s;on."</P>
<P>Perhaps if we con&s;ider matters impartially, the&s;e men have the advantage of us: The little cordialities of life are more frequently in u&s;e than its greater and more important duties. Some|body, I think, has compared them to &s;mall pieces of coin, which, though of le&s;s value than the large, are more current among&s;t men; but the parallel fails in one re&s;pect: A thou&s;and of the&s;e <HI>livres</HI> do not con&s;titute a <HI>louis;</HI> and I have known many characters po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all that the fir&s;t could give, who&s;e minds were incapable of the la&s;t. In this number, however, I mean not to include Rouill&eacute;.</P>
<P>We have another gue&s;t, who illu&s;trates my meaning better, the widow of Sancerre, whom you introduced to my acquaintance, a long time ago, in <HI>Spain.</HI> She was then nothing; for San|cerre con&s;idered all women nothing, and took care that, during his life, &s;he &s;hould be no ex|ception to the rule. He died; &s;he regained her freedom; and &s;he u&s;es it as one to whom it had long been denied. She is ju&s;t fool enough to be a wit, and carries on a perpetual cru&s;ade again&s;t
<PB N="56" REF="017578_0175_0FBA70A900D7CA30">
&s;en&s;e and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. I bear with her very im|patiently: She plagues me, I believe, the more. My wife &s;miles, Rouill&eacute; laughs at me; I am un|able to laugh, and a&s;hamed to be angry; &s;o I remain &s;ilent and &s;tupid.</P>
<P>Sometimes I cea&s;e to think of her, and blame my&s;elf. Why &s;hould I allow this &s;pleen of &s;en&s;e to di&s;qualify me for &s;ociety?&mdash;Once or twice I almo&s;t muttered things again&s;t my pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion.&mdash;JULIA loves me; I know &s;he does: She has that tenderne&s;s and gratitude, which will &s;ecure her affection to a hu&s;band, who loves her as I do; but &s;he mu&s;t often feel the difference of di&s;po&s;ition between us. Had &s;uch a man as Rouill&eacute; been her hu&s;band&mdash;not Rouill&eacute; neither, though &s;he &s;eems often delighted with his good humour, when I cannot be plea&s;ed with it.&mdash;</P>
<P>We are neither of us &s;uch a man as the writer of a romance would have made a hu&s;band for JULIA.&mdash;There, is indeed, a pliability in the minds of women in this article, which frequently gains over opinion to the &s;ide of duty.&mdash;Duty is a cold word.&mdash;No matter, we will canvas it no farther. I know the purity of her bo&s;om, and I think, I am not unworthy of its affection.</P>
<P>Her father I &s;ee much &s;eldomer than I could wi&s;h; but he is greatly altered of late, Since the
<PB N="57" REF="017578_0176_0FBA70AA653F9D30">
time of his wife's death, I have ob&s;erved him droop apace; but JULIA &s;ays, that the di&s;tre&s;s of their circum&s;tances kept up in him a &s;ort of fal&s;e &s;pirit, which, when they were di&s;embar|ra&s;&s;ed, left him to &s;ink under reflection. His fa|culties, I can ea&s;ily perceive, are not in that vi|gour they were wont to be; yet his bodily &s;trength does not much decline, and he &s;eems more con|tented with him&s;elf, than he was when in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his abilities. We wi&s;h him to live with us; but he has con&s;tantly refu&s;ed our reque&s;t, and it is a matter of delicacy to pre&s;s him on that point. We go to &s;ee him &s;ometimes: He receives us with &s;atisfaction, not ardour: Violent emotions of every kind appear to be quenched in him. It creates, methinks, a feeling of mingled com|placency and &s;adne&s;s, to look on the evening of a life and of a character like Roubign&eacute;'s.</P>
<P>Shall I not &s;ee you here &s;ome time this autumn? You gave me a &s;ort of promi&s;e, and I need you more than ever. I want the &s;ociety of &s;ome one, in who&s;e company I can be plea&s;ed, without the tax of thinking that I am filly for being &s;o.</P>

She &s;hould be contented with the affection &s;he knows I bear for her. I do not expect her to be romantically happy, and &s;he has no cau&s;e for unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;I am not unea&s;y nei|ther&mdash;yet I wi&s;h her to conquer this melancholy.</P>
<P>I was la&s;t night abroad at &s;upper: JULIA was a-bed before my return. I found her lute lying on the table, and a mu&s;ic-book open by it. I could perceive the marks of tears &s;hed on the pa|per, and the air was &s;uch as might encourage their falling: Sleep however had overcome her &s;adne&s;s, and &s;he did not awake when I opened the curtains to look on her. When I had &s;tood &s;ome moments, I heard her &s;igh &s;trongly through her &s;leep, and pre&s;ently &s;he muttered &s;ome words, I know not of what import. I had &s;ometimes heard her do &s;o before, without regarding it much; but there was &s;omething that rou&s;ed my attention now. I li&s;tened; &s;he &s;ighed again, and again &s;poke a few broken words; at la&s;t I heard her plainly pronounce the name <HI>Savillon,</HI> two or three times over, and each time it was accom|panied with &s;ighs &s;o deep, that her heart &s;eemed

bur&s;ting as it heaved them. I confe&s;s the thing &s;truck me, and, after mu&s;ing on it &s;ome time, I re&s;olved to try a little experiment this day at din|ner, to di&s;cover whether chance had made her pronounce this name, or if &s;ome previous cau&s;e had impre&s;&s;ed it on her imagination. I knew a man of that name at <HI>Paris,</HI> when I fir&s;t went thither, who had an office under the intendant of the marine. I introduced &s;ome conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of the fleet, and &s;aid, in an indifferent manner, that I had heard &s;o and &s;o from my old acquaintance Savillon. She &s;pilt &s;ome &s;oup &s;he was helping me to at the in&s;tant; and, &s;tealing a glance at her, I &s;aw her cheeks flu&s;hed into crim&s;on.</P>
<P>I have been ever &s;ince going the round of con|jecture on this incident. I think I can recollect once, and but once, her father &s;peak of a per|&s;on called Savillon re&s;iding abroad, from whom he had received a letter; but I never heard JULIA mention him at all. I know not why I &s;hould have forborn a&s;king her the rea&s;on of her being &s;o affected at the &s;ound; yet at the moment I per|ceived it, the que&s;tion &s;tuck in my throat. I felt &s;omething like guilt hang over this incident alto|gether&mdash;it is none of mine then&mdash;nor of JULIA'S neither, I tru&s;t&mdash;and yet, Segarva, it
<PB N="62" REF="017578_0181_0FBA70B5580EA548">
has touched me nearer&mdash;much nearer than I &s;hould own to any one but you.</P>
<P><HI>Nine at night.</HI></P>
<P>Upon looking over what I had written in the afternoon, I had almo&s;t re&s;olved to burn this let|ter, and write another; but it &s;trikes me as in|&s;incerity to a friend like Segarva, not to tru&s;t him with the very thought of the moment, weak as it may be.</P>
<P>I begin now to be a&s;hamed of the effect that trifle, I mentioned above, had upon me. JULIA is better and has been &s;inging to me the old Spa|ni&s;h ballad, which you &s;ent us lately. I am de|lighted with tho&s;e antient national &s;ongs, becau&s;e there is a &s;implicity, and an expre&s;&s;ion in them, which I can under&s;tand. Adepts in mu&s;ic are plea&s;ed with more intricate compo&s;itions; and they talk more of the plea&s;ure than they feel; and others talk after them, without feeling at all.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. SAVILLON TO HERBERT.</HEAD>
<P>I AM here in <HI>Paris,</HI> and fulfil the promi&s;e, which your friend&s;hip required of me, to write to you immediately on my arrival.</P>
<P>Alas! my reception is not &s;uch as I looked for. He, whom alone my arrival &s;hould have intere&s;ted my ever faithful Beauvaris!&mdash;he meets me not&mdash;we &s;hall never meet&mdash;he died, while I was imagining fond things of our meeting!</P>
<P>Gracious GOD! what have I done, that I &s;hould be always thus an outca&s;t from &s;ociety? When <HI>France</HI> was dear to me as life it&s;elf, my de&s;tiny tore me from her coa&s;t; now, when I an|ticipated the plea&s;ures of my return, is this the welcome &s;he affords me?</P>
<P>Forlorn and friendle&s;s as my early days were, I complained not while Beauvaris was mine: He was wholly mine, for his heart was not made for the world. Naturally re&s;erved, he &s;hrunk early from its notice; and, when he had lived to judge of its &s;entiments, he wi&s;hed not to be in the li&s;t of its friends.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="017578_0183_0FBA70BA81A2BB50">
His extreme mode&s;ty, indeed, was an evil in his fate; becau&s;e it deprived him of that pro|tection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which his &s;ituation required. Tho&s;e who might have been patrons of his merit, had not time to &s;earch for talents his ba&s;hfulne&s;s ob&s;cured. His virtues even &s;uffered imputation from it: Shy, not only of intimacy, but even of opinion and &s;entiment, per&s;ons who&s;e &s;ituation &s;eemed to entitle them to his confidence, com|plained of his coldne&s;s and indifference, and he was accu&s;ed of want of feeling, from what, in truth, was an exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility. This jewel, undi&s;covered by others, was mine. From infancy, each had accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to con&s;ider his friend but a better part of him&s;elf; and, when the heart of either was full, talking to the other was but unloading it in &s;oliloquy.</P>
<P>Forgive me, my dear Herbert, for thus dwell|ing on the &s;ubject. The only &s;ad comfort I have now left me, is to think of his worth: It is a privilege I would not wa&s;te, on common minds, to hear me on this theme; yours can under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>Why was I ab&s;ent from <HI>Paris?</HI> Too much did the latter days of Beauvaris require me! They &s;aw him &s;truggling with poverty as well as &s;ick|ne&s;s; yet the la&s;t letter he wrote me confe&s;&s;ed neither; and &s;ome little pre&s;ents, the produce of
<PB N="65" REF="017578_0184_0FBA70BBC1ABBFE8">
<HI>Martinique,</HI> which I &s;ent him, he would not con|vert into money, becau&s;e they came from me.</P>
<P>I am now &s;itting in the room, in which he died!&mdash;On that paltry bed lay the head of Beauvaris&mdash;on this de&s;k, whereon I write, he wrote!&mdash;Pardon me a while, I am unable to go on.</P>
<P>It is from the indulgence of &s;orrow, that we fir&s;t know a re&s;pite from affliction. I have given a loo&s;e to my grief, and I feel the relief, which my tears have afforded me. I am now returned to my hotel, and am able to recollect my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have not yet &s;een any acquaintance of Mon&s;. de Roubign&eacute;; this blow, indeed, did not allow me lei&s;ure or &s;pirits for enquiry; I feel as if I were in a foreign land, and am almo&s;t afraid of the noi&s;e and bu&s;tle I hear in the &s;treets. I have &s;ent, however, offering a vi&s;it to a particular young lady, of whom I &s;hall be able to get intelligence of Roubign&eacute;'s family; but my me&s;|&s;enger is not yet returned.</P>
<P>He has found her, and &s;he has appointed me to come to her to-morrow morning. You cannot
<PB N="66" REF="017578_0185_0FBA70BD5AFDF150">
imagine what a flutter the expectation of this vi&s;it has thrown me into; I am not apt to &s;tand in awe of pre&s;ages, but I could be very weak that way at this moment. My man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a happy vivacity, brought me in, after dinner, a bottle of Burgundy, which, he &s;aid, the land|lord a&s;&s;ured him was excellent. I have drunk three-fourths of it, by way of medicine; it has made my head &s;omewhat dizzy, but my heart is as heavy as before.</P>
<P>What a letter of egoti&s;m have I written! but you have taught me to give vent to my feelings, by the acquaintance you have allowed me with yours. To &s;peak ones di&s;tre&s;&s;es to the unfeeling is terrible; even to a&s;k the alms of pity is hu|miliating; but to pour our griefs into the bo&s;om of a friend, is but committing to him a pledge above the tru&s;t of ordinary men.</P>
<P>Do not, I be&s;eech you, forget your de&s;ign of travelling into <HI>France</HI> this &s;ea&s;on;&mdash;yet why &s;hould I a&s;k this? I know not where fortune may lead me! it cannot, however, place me in a &s;ituation, where the friend&s;hip of Herbert &s;hall be forgotten.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. SAVILLON TO HERBERT.</HEAD>
<P>BEAR with me, Herbert, bear with me. The fir&s;t u&s;e I make of that corre&s;pondence which you de&s;ired, is to pour out my mi&s;eries be|fore you! but you can hear them.&mdash;You have known what it is to love, and to de&s;pair as I do.</P>
<P>When I told you, my Beauvaris was no more, I thought I had exhau&s;ted the &s;um of di&s;tre&s;s, which this vi&s;it to <HI>Paris</HI> was to give me. I knew not then what fate had prepared for me&mdash;that JULIA, on whom my doating hear had re&s;ted all its hopes of happine&s;s;&mdash;that JULIA is the wife of another!</P>
<P>All but this I could have borne; the lo&s;s of for|tune, the decay of health, the coldne&s;s of friends, might have admitted of hope; here only was de&s;pair to be found, and here I have found it!</P>
<P>Oh! Herbert! &s;he was &s;o interwoven with my thoughts of futurity, that life now fades into a blank, and is not worth the keeping;&mdash;but I have a u&s;e for it; I will &s;ee her yet at lea&s;t&mdash;
<PB N="68" REF="017578_0187_0FBA70C2643B11F8">
Wherefore &s;hould I wi&s;h to &s;ee her?&mdash;Yet, me|thinks, it is now the only object that can prompt a wi&s;h in me.</P>
<P>When I vi&s;ited that lady, that MARIA DE RONCILLES, whom I knew to be the deare&s;t of her friends, &s;he &s;eemed to receive me with con|fu&s;ion; her tongue could &s;carce articulate the words that told me of JULIA'S marriage: She mentioned &s;omething too, of having heard of mine.&mdash;I am tortured every way with con|jecture&mdash;my brain &s;carce holds its recollection.&mdash;JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute; is married to another!</P>
<P>I know not what I &s;aid to this friend of her's at fir&s;t; I remember only that, when I had re|covered a little, I begged her to convey a letter from me to JULIA; &s;he &s;eemed to he&s;itate in her con&s;ent; but &s;he did at la&s;t con&s;ent. Twice have I written, and twice have I burnt what I had written&mdash;I have no friend to guide, to direct me&mdash;not even to weep to!</P>
<P>At la&s;t I have fini&s;hed that letter; it contains the la&s;t reque&s;t which the mi&s;erable Savillon has to make. This one interview pa&s;t, and my days have nothing to mark them with anxiety or hope.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="017578_0188_0FBA70C3E89849C8">
I am now more calmly wretched; the writing of that letter has releived for a while my &s;welling heart. I went with it my&s;elf to Madamoi&s;elle de Ron|cilles's; &s;he was abroad, &s;o I left it without &s;eeing her. You can judge of my feelings; I wondered at the indifference of the faces I met with in my way; they had no cares to cloud them, none at lea&s;t like Savillon's.&mdash;Why of all tho&s;e thou|&s;ands am I the mo&s;t wretched?</P>

<P>WHAT do you tell me! Savillon in <HI>Paris!</HI> unmarried, unengaged, raving of JULIA! Hide me from my&s;elf, MARIA, hide me from my&s;elf&mdash;Am I not the wife of Montauban?&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, and I know that character which as the wife of Montauban, I have to &s;upport: Her hu&s;band's honour and her own are in the brea&s;t of JULIA. My heart &s;wells, while I think of the &s;tation in which I am placed.&mdash;Relentle&s;s Ho|nour! thou trie&s;t me to the uttermo&s;t; thou en|joine&s;t me to think no more of &s;uch a being as Savillon.</P>

He came, uncon&s;cious of what Fortune had made of me; he came, elate with the hopes of &s;haring with his JULIA that wealth, which propitious Heaven had be&s;towed on him.&mdash;She is married to another!&mdash;I &s;ee him &s;tart back in amazement and de&s;pair; his eye wild and

haggard, his voice lo&s;t in the throb of a&s;toni&s;h|ment! He thinks on the &s;hadows which his fond hopes had reared&mdash;the dreams of happine&s;s!&mdash;Say not that he wept at the thought.&mdash;Had tho&s;e tears fallen upon JULIA'S grave, Memory! thou could&s;t not thus have &s;tung me. But, per|haps, gentle as his nature is, he was no weak enough to be overcome by the thought. Could he but think of me with indifference&mdash;Tell him, MARIA, what a wretch I am: A wife, without a wife's affection, to whom life has lo&s;t its reli&s;h, and virtue its reward. Let him hate me, I de&s;erve his &s;corn&mdash;yet, methinks, I may claim his pity.&mdash;</P>
<P>The daughter of Roubign&eacute;, the wife of Mon|tauban! I will not bear to be pitied. No; I will &s;tifle the grief that would betray me, and be mi&s;erable without a witne&s;s. This heart &s;hall break, this proud heart, without &s;uffering a &s;igh to relieve it.</P>
<P>Alas! my friend, it will not be.&mdash;That picture, MARIA, that picture! Why did I not bani&s;h it from my &s;ight? too amiable Savillon! Look there, look there! in that eye there is no &s;corn, no reproach to the unhappy JULIA: Mildne&s;s and melancholy!&mdash;We were born
<PB N="72" REF="017578_0191_0FBA70CAB89C1C78">
to be mi&s;erable!&mdash;Think'&s;t thou, MARIA, that at this moment&mdash;it is po&s;&s;ible&mdash;he is gazing thus on the re&s;emblance of one, who&s;e ill fated ra&s;hne&s;s has undone her&s;elf and him!&mdash;Will he thus weep over it as I do? Will he par|don my offences, and thus pre&s;s it?&mdash;I dare not! This bo&s;om is the property of Montauban.&mdash;Tears are all I have to be&s;tow. Is there guilt in tho&s;e tears? Heaven knows, I cannot help weeping.</P>
<P>I was interrupted by the voice of my hu&s;band giving &s;ome orders to his &s;ervant at the door of my apartment. He entered with a look of gaiety; but I fear by the change of his countenance, that he ob&s;erved my tears. I clapped on my hat to hide them, and told him, as well as I could, that I was going to walk. He &s;uffered me to leave him, without any further que&s;tion, I &s;trolled I knew not whither, till I found my&s;elf by the &s;ide of a little brook, about a quarter of a mile's di&s;tance from the hou&s;e. The &s;tillne&s;s of noon, broken only by the gentle murmuring of the water, and the quiet hum of the bees, that hung on the wild flowers around it; the&s;e gave me back my&s;elf, and allowed me the languor of thought; my tears &s;ell without controul, and almo&s;t with|out di&s;tre&s;s. I would have looked again on the
<PB N="73" REF="017578_0192_0FBA70CC449A2960">
picture of Savillon, for I could then have tru&s;ted my&s;elf with the &s;ight of it; but I had left it be|hind in my chamber. The thoughts of its being &s;een by my hu&s;band gave wings to my return. I hope he mi&s;&s;ed it; for I found it lying, as I had left it, on my dre&s;&s;ing-table, in the mid&s;t of &s;ome letters of compliment, which had been thrown carele&s;sly there the day before; and, when I went down &s;tairs, I di&s;covered nothing in his be|haviour that &s;hould have followed &s;uch a di&s;covery. On the contrary, I think, he &s;eemed more plea&s;ed than u&s;ual, and was particularly attentive to me. I felt his kindne&s;s a reproach, and my endeavours to return it &s;at aukwardly upon me. There was a treachery methought, in my attempts to plea&s;e him, and, I fear, the greater ea&s;e I meant to a&s;&s;ume in making tho&s;e attempts, I gave them only more the appearance of con&s;traint.</P>
<P>What a &s;ituation is mine! to wear the appear|ance of &s;erenity, while my heart is wretched, and the di&s;&s;imulation of guilt, though my &s;oul is uncon&s;cious of a crime!&mdash;There is &s;omething predictive in my mind, that tells me I &s;hall not long be thus; but I am &s;ick of conjecture, as I am bere&s;t of hope, and only &s;atisfy my&s;elf with concluding, that, in the mo&s;t fateful lives, there is &s;till a certain point, where the maze of de&s;tiny can bewilder no more!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XL. MONTAUBAN TO SEGARVA.</HEAD>
<P>LONQUILLEZ has not &s;lept on his po&s;t and chance has a&s;&s;i&s;ted his vigilance. Le Blanc came hither the morning after our con|ver&s;ation: Lonquillez managed his enquiry with equal acutene&s;s and caution: The other told every thing as the &s;tory of an old man&mdash;he &s;miled and told it. He knew not that he was delivering the te&s;timony of a witne&s;s&mdash;that the fate of his former mi&s;tre&s;s hung on it!</P>
<P>This Savillon lived at <HI>Belville</HI> from his earlie&s;t youth, the companion of JULIA, though a de|pendant on her father. When they were forced to remove thence, he accompanied their retreat, the only companion of Roubign&eacute;, whom adver&s;ity had left him to comfort it&mdash;but he had his
<PB N="79" REF="017578_0198_0FBA6F9EB1B18EC0">
reward: The company of the daughter often &s;up|plied the place of her father's. He was her ma&s;ter in literature, her fellow-&s;cholar in mu&s;ic and painting, and they frequently planned walks in concert which they afterwards trod together.&mdash;Le Blanc has &s;een them there, li&s;tening to the &s;ong of the nightingale.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am to draw the conclu&s;ion.&mdash;All this might be innocent, the effects of early intimacy and friend&s;hip; and on this &s;uppo&s;ition might re&s;t the quiet of an indifferent hu&s;band. But why was this intimacy, this friend&s;hip, &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed from me? The name of Savillon never mentioned, except in guilty dreams; while his picture was kept in her chamber for the adultery of the imagination!&mdash;Do I triumph while I pu&s;h this evidence?&mdash;Segarva whither will it lead me&punc;</P>
<P>The truth ri&s;es upon me, and every &s;ucceeding circum&s;tance points to one conclu&s;ion. Li&s;ette was to-day of a junketing party, which Lon|quillez contrived for the entertainment of his friend Le Blanc. Mention was again made of old &s;tories, and Savillon was a per&s;on of the drama. The wench is naturally talkative, and &s;he was then in &s;pirits from company and good cheer. Le Blanc and &s;he recollected interviews of their young
<PB N="80" REF="017578_0199_0FBA6FA4877F1CF8">
mi&s;tre&s;s and this hand&s;ome <HI>el&egrave;ve</HI> of her father. They were, it &s;eems, nur&s;ed by the &s;ame woman, that old La&s;une, for whom JULIA procured a little dwelling, and a pen&s;ion of four hundred livres, from her un&s;u&s;pecting hu&s;band. "She loved them (&s;aid Le Blanc) like her own children, and they were like brother and &s;i&s;ter to each other"&mdash;"Brother and &s;i&s;ter, indeed!" (&s;aid Li&s;ette.) She was more &s;agacious, and had ob|&s;erved things better.&mdash;"I know what I know, (&s;aid &s;he) but to be &s;ure, tho&s;e things are all over now, and, I am per&s;uaded, my mi&s;tre&s;s loves no man &s;o well as her own hu&s;band. What &s;ignifies what happened &s;o long ago, e&s;pecially while Mon&s;. de Montauban knows nothing about the matter?"</P>
<P>The&s;e were her words: Lonquillez repeated them thrice to me.&mdash;were I a fool, a driveller, I might be &s;atisfied to doubt and be unea&s;y; it is Montauban's to &s;ee his di&s;grace, and, &s;eeing, to revenge it.</P>

He went with Le Blanc to &s;ee La&s;une, whom that old man, it &s;eems, never fails to vi&s;it when he is here. Lonquillez told her, that Le Blanc had news for her about her fo&s;ter-&s;on. "Of my dear Savillion?" cried &s;he. "Yes (&s;aid Le Blanc) You will have heard, that he arrived from abroad &s;ome weeks ago; and I am told, that he is worth a power of money, which his uncle left him in the We&s;t-Indies"&mdash;"Ble&s;s him! Heaven's ble&s;s him! (cried La&s;une.) Then I may &s;ee him once more before I die. You never &s;aw him, (turning to Lonquillez) but Le Blanc remembers him well: The hand&s;ome&s;t, &s;weete&s;t, be&s;t con|ditioned&mdash;your mi&s;tre&s;s and he have often &s;at on that bench there&mdash;Lord pity my forgetfulne&s;s!&mdash;it was far from this place; but it was ju&s;t &s;uch a bench&mdash;and they would prefer poor Lazune's little treat to all the fine things at my ma&s;ter's&mdash;and how he would look on my &s;weet child! Well, well, de&s;tiny rules every thing; but there was a time, when I thought I &s;hould have called her by another name than Montauban,"&mdash;Lon|quillez was too much &s;truck with her words to ap|pear unaffected by them: She ob&s;erved his &s;ur|pri&s;e.&mdash;"You think no harm, I hope," &s;aid &s;he. He a&s;&s;ured her he did not. "Nay, I need not care, for that part, who hears me, yet &s;ome folks might think it odd; but we are all friends

<P>Such were her words; the memory of Lon|quillez is faithful, and he was intere&s;ted to re|member.&mdash;I drew my breath &s;hort, and muttered vengeance: The good fellow &s;aw my warmth, and tried to moderate it. "It is a matter, Sir, (&s;aid he) of &s;uch importance, that, if I may pre&s;ume to a vi&s;e, nothing &s;hould be be|lieved ra&s;hly. If my mi&s;tre&s;s loves Savillon, if he &s;till an&s;wers her fondne&s;s, they will &s;urely write to each other.

<P>I have agreed to his propo&s;al.&mdash;How am I fallen, Segarva, when &s;uch artifices are ea&s;y to me!&mdash;But I will not pau&s;e on trivial objections&mdash;the fate of Montauban is &s;et upon this ca&s;t, and the le&s;&s;er moralities mu&s;t &s;peak unheeded.</P>

<P>Not in the way he a&s;ks&mdash;let him come as the friend of JULIA DE ROUBIGN&Eacute;&mdash;Oh!

<P>When I look back on that life, how fateful has it been! Is it unju&s;t in Providence, to make this &s;o often the lot of hearts little able to &s;truggle with misfortune? or is it indeed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch hearts, that creates their misfortunes? Had I not felt as I have done, half the ills I complain of had been nothing, and at this moment I were happy. Yet to have wanted &s;uch a heart, ill|&s;uited as it is to the rude touch of &s;ublunary things&mdash;I think I cannot wi&s;h &s;o much. There will come a time, MARIA, (might I forebode

His affection for me is the only &s;en&s;e now quite alive about him, nay it too par|takes of imbecillity. He u&s;ed to embrace me with ardour: He now embraces me with tears.</P>
<P>Judge then, if I am able to meet Savillon, at this time, if I could allow my&s;elf to meet him at all. Think what I am, and what he is. The coolne&s;s I ought to maintain had been difficult at be&s;t; at pre&s;ent, it is impo&s;&s;ible. I can &s;carce think without weeping; and to &s;ee that form&mdash;</P>

Savillon was already a to|lerable de&s;igner; but he joined with me in be|coming &s;cholar to this man. When our ma&s;ter was with us, he u&s;ed &s;ometimes to guide my hand;

I am now thinking what I have to do with the hours that remain: Meet me like a man and help me to employ them as I ought. Nothing &s;hall drag me back to Europe, and therefore I would &s;hake off every occa&s;ion to revi&s;it it.</P>
<P>Though the externals of place and di&s;tance are not of much importance to me, yet there is &s;ome|thing in large towns that I wi&s;h to avoid. As you mention a de&s;ign of being in Dor&s;et&s;hire &s;ometime &s;oon, may I a&s;k you to make next week that time, and meet me at the town of Poole in that county? Incon&s;iderable and unknown as I am, there are circum&s;tances that might mark me out in Picardy; and therefore I &s;hall go by Dieppe to that port of <HI>England,</HI> where I know I &s;hall, at this &s;ea&s;on, find an opportunity of getting over the Atlantic.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLV. JULIA TO MARIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE hour is almo&s;t arrived! My hu&s;band has ju&s;t left me: He came into my room in his riding-dre&s;s.&mdash;"I &s;hall not be at home (&s;aid he) till &s;upper time, and Rouille&eacute;'s &s;hooting party will detain him till it is late." The con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my purpo&s;e pre&s;&s;ed on my tongue, while I an&s;wered him: I faltered and could hard|ly &s;peak. "You &s;peak faintly (&s;aid Montauban) You are not ill, I hope," taking my hand. I told him, truly, that my head ached a good deal, that it had ached all day, that I meant to try if a walk would do it &s;ervice. "Perhaps it may," an&s;wered he, and methought he looked &s;teadily, and with a &s;ort of que&s;tion, at me; or rather my own mind interpreted his look in that manner.&mdash;I believe I blu&s;hed.&mdash;</P>
<P>How I tremble as I look on my watch! Would I could recal my promi&s;e!</P>
<P>I am &s;omewhat bolder now; but it is not from having conquered my fear; &s;omething like de|&s;pair

a&s;&s;i&s;ts me.&mdash;It wants but a few minutes&mdash;the hand that points them &s;eems to &s;peak as I watch it:&mdash;I come, Savillon, I come!</P>
<P>How &s;hall I de&s;cribe our meeting? I am unfit for de&s;cribing&mdash;it cannot be de&s;cribed&mdash;I &s;hall be calmer by and by.</P>
<P>I know not how I got to the hou&s;e. From the moment I quitted my chamber, I was uncon&s;cious of every thing around me. The fir&s;t object that &s;truck my eye was Savillon! I recollect my nur&s;e placing me in a chair oppo&s;ite to where he &s;at&mdash;&s;he left us&mdash;I felt the room turning round with me&mdash;I had fainted, it &s;eems. When I recover|ed, I found her &s;upporting me in her arms, and holding a phial of &s;alts to my no&s;e. Savillon had my hands in his, gazing on me with a coun|tenance of di&s;tre&s;s and terror.&mdash;My eye met his, and, for &s;ome moments, I looked on him, as I have done in my dreams, unmindful of our &s;i|tuation.&mdash;The pre&s;&s;ure of his hand awaken|ed me to recollection. He looked on me more earne&s;tly &s;till, and breathed out the word JU|LIA!&mdash;It was all he could utter; but it &s;poke &s;uch things, MARIA!&mdash;You cannot under&s;tand its force. Had you felt it as I did!&mdash;I could not, indeed, I could not help bur&s;ting into tears.</P>

"My deare&s;t children," cried the good La|&s;une, taking our hands which were &s;till folded to|gether, and &s;queezing them in hers. The action had &s;omething of that tender &s;implicity in it, which is not to be re&s;i&s;ted. I wept afre&s;h; but my tears were le&s;s painful than before.</P>
<P>She fetched a bottle of wine from a cupboard, and forced me to take a gla&s;s of it. She offered another to Savillon. He put it by, with a gentle inclination of his head. "You &s;hall drink it, indeed, my dear boy, (&s;aid &s;he) it is a long time &s;ince you ta&s;ted any thing in this hou&s;e."&mdash;He gave a deep &s;igh and drank it.</P>
<P>She had given us time to recover the power of &s;peech; but I knew le&s;s how to begin &s;peaking than before. My eyes now found &s;omething in Savillon's, which they were a&s;hamed to meet.&mdash;La&s;une left us; I almo&s;t wi&s;hed her to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Savillon &s;at down in his former place: He threw his eyes on the ground&mdash;"I know not, (&s;aid he, in a faltering voice) how to thank you for the conde&s;cen&s;ion of this interview&mdash;our former friend&s;hip"&mdash;I trembled for what he &s;eemed about to &s;ay.&mdash;I have not forgotten it," &s;aid I, half interrupting him.&mdash;I &s;aw him &s;tart from his former po&s;ture, as if awaked by the &s;ound of of my voice."&mdash;"I a&s;k not (continued he) to

This was too much. When I could recollect my|&s;elf, I felt that it was too much. I would have
<PB N="102" REF="017578_0221_0FBA6FE16C6A8390">
retracted what I had &s;aid: I &s;poke of the duty I owed to Montauban, of the e&s;teem which his vir|tues de&s;erved.&mdash;"I have heard of his worth (&s;aid Savillon) I needed no proof to be convinced of it; he is the hu&s;band of JULIA."&mdash;There was &s;omething in the tone of the&s;e la&s;t words, that undid my re&s;olution again.&mdash;I told him of the fal&s;e intelligence I had received of his mar|riage, without which no argument of prudence, no paternal influence, could have made me the wife of another.&mdash;He put his hand to his heart, and threw his eyes wildly to Heaven.&mdash;I &s;hrunk back at that look of de&s;pair, which his countenance a&s;&s;umed.&mdash;He took two or three hurried turns through the room; then, re&s;uming his &s;eat, and lowering his voice, "It is enough (&s;aid he) I am fated to be mi&s;erable! but the contagion of my de&s;tiny &s;hall &s;pread no farther.&mdash;This night I leave <HI>France</HI> forever!"&mdash;"This night!" I exclaimed. "It mu&s;t be &s;o (&s;aid he, with a determined calmne&s;s) but before I go, let me depo&s;it in your hands this paper. It is a me|morial of that Savillon, who was the friend of JULIA!"&mdash;I opened it: It was a will, be|queathing his fortune to me. "This mu&s;t not be (&s;aid I), this mu&s;t not be. Think not, I conjure you, &s;o de&s;pairingly of life; live to enjoy that fortune, which is &s;o &s;eldom the reward of merit like thine. I have no title to its di&s;po&s;al." "You

To make it thine, was the purpo&s;e of my wi&s;hing to acquire it; to make it thine, is &s;till in my power." "I can|not receive this, indeed I cannot. Think of the &s;ituation in which I &s;tand." I pre&s;&s;ed the paper upon him: He took it at la&s;t, and pau&s;ing, as if he thought, for a moment&mdash;"You are right, there may be an impropriety in your keeping it.&mdash;Alas! I have &s;carce a friend, to whom I can intru&s;t any thing; yet I may find one, who will &s;ee it faithfully executed."</P>
<P>He was interrupted by La&s;une, who entered &s;omewhat hurriedly, and told me, Li&s;ette was come to fetch me, and that &s;he had met my hu&s;|band in her way to the hou&s;e. "We mu&s;t part then (&s;aid he) for ever!&mdash;let not a thought of the unfortunate Savillon di&s;turb the happine&s;s which Heaven allots to JULIA; &s;he &s;hall hear of him but once again&mdash;when that period arrives, it will not offend the happy Montauban, if &s;he drops a tear to the memory of one, who&s;e love was expiated by his &s;ufferings!"&mdash;MARIA! was it a breach of virtue, if then I threw my&s;elf on his neck, if then I wept on his bo&s;om?

<P>I was weak enough to call back Li&s;ette.

<P>My fears had given way to &s;leep; but their impre&s;&s;ion was on my fancy &s;till.

<P>THE writer of this letter has no title to addre&s;s you, except that which common friend&s;hip and common calamity may give him.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the fatal &s;cenes, which he has lately witne&s;&s;ed, his recollection was lo&s;t; when it re|turned, it &s;poke of Mademoi&s;elle de Roncilles, the fir&s;t, he believes, and deare&s;t friend of the mo&s;t amiable, but mo&s;t unfortunate Madame de Montauban The office he now undertakes is ter|rible; but it is nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;You mu&s;t &s;oon be told, that your excellent friend is no more!

<P>On the evening of Thur&s;day la&s;t, I was told Madam de Montauban was a good deal indi&s;|po&s;ed and had gone to bed before her u&s;ual time.
<PB N="112" REF="017578_0231_0FBA6FFB7112AEE0">
At a very &s;hort and &s;ilent &s;upper, I perceived her hu&s;band uncommonly agitated, and, as &s;oon as decency would allow me, withdrew and left him. Betwixt eleven and twelve o'clock. (I had not gone to bed) one of the maid-&s;ervants came to my room, begging I would in&s;tantly attend her to the chamber of her mi&s;tre&s;s, who was &s;o extremely ill, that without immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they feared the very wor&s;t con&s;equences. I had formerly &s;tudied a little phy&s;ic, and been in u&s;e to practice it in &s;ome particular campaigns, when abler a&s;|&s;i&s;tance could not be had. I ran down &s;tairs with the &s;ervant, de&s;iring my own man to &s;eek out a little ca&s;e of lancets and follow us. The girl in|formed her mi&s;tre&s;s of my being at the door of her apartment. She de&s;ired I might come in, and with that &s;mile, which &s;ickne&s;s could not quench, &s;tretched out her hand to me. I found her pul&s;e low and weak, and &s;he complained of a &s;trange fluttering at her heart, which hardly allowed her to &s;peak. I was afraid to venture on bleeding, and only gave her a little of &s;ome common re&s;toratives that were at hand. She found her&s;elf &s;omewhat relieved, and &s;at up in her bed &s;upported by her maid. Montauban entered the room: His coun|tenance &s;urpri&s;ed me: It was not that of di&s;tre&s;s alone, it was marked with turbulence and horror. It &s;eemed to hurt his wife. At that moment &s;he

was &s;carce able to &s;peak; but &s;he forced out a few broken words, begging him to leave the room, for that her illne&s;s affected him too much. He withdrew in &s;ilence. In a little time &s;he &s;eemed a good deal ea&s;ier; but her pul&s;e was &s;till lower than before. She ordered her maid to call Mon&s;. de Montauban again: "I dare not tru&s;t to future moments (&s;aid &s;he) and I have &s;omething im|portant to reveal to him."&mdash;I offered to leave the room as he entered.&mdash;"His friend may hear it"&mdash;&s;he &s;aid, in a faltering voice. She fixed her eye languidly, but &s;teadily on Montau|ban. He advanced towards her with an eager gaze, without uttering a word. When &s;he would have &s;poken, her voice failed her again, and &s;he beckoned, but with a mode&s;ty in her action, &s;ignifying her de&s;ire that he &s;hould &s;it down by her. She took his hand; he &s;eemed uncon&s;cious of her taking it, and continued to bend a look of earne&s;tne&s;s upon her.</P>

<PB N="114" REF="017578_0233_0FBA70009656AC78">
are allowed me to confe&s;s my offence, and intreat your forgivene&s;s."</P>
<P>"Thou wert guilty then?"&mdash;exclaimed her hu&s;band, &s;tarting from his &s;eat. She pau&s;ed in a&s;toni&s;hment at the impa&s;&s;ioned ge&s;ture he a&s;|&s;umed&mdash;"Speak!" cried Montauban, re|covering him&s;elf a little, his voice &s;uffocated with the word.</P>
<P>"When you have heard me (&s;aid JULIA), you will find I am le&s;s guilty than unfortunate; yet I am not innocent, for then I &s;hould not have been the wife of Montauban."</P>
<P>"When I became yours, my heart owned you not for the lord of its affections; there was an attachment&mdash;yet look not &s;o &s;ternly on me.&mdash;He, in who&s;e favour that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was formed, would not have wronged you if he could. His virtues were the objects of my affection; and had Savillon been the thing you fear, JULIA had been guiltle&s;s even of loving him in &s;ecret. Till ye|&s;terday he never told me his love; till ye&s;terday he knew not I had ever loved him."&mdash;</P>
<P>"But ye&s;terday," cried Montauban, &s;eeming to check the agitation he had &s;hewn before, and lowering his voice into a tone of calm &s;everity.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="017578_0234_0FBA70026BDE6860">
"For the offence of ye&s;terday, (&s;aid &s;he) I would obtain your pardon, and die in peace. I met Savillon in &s;ecret; I &s;aw the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, and pitied it.&mdash;Was it a crime thus to meet him? Was it a crime to confe&s;s my love, while I received the la&s;t farewell of the unfortu|nate Savillon? This is my offence&mdash;perhaps the la&s;t that JULIA can commit, or you forgive!"</P>
<P>He cla&s;ped his hands convul&s;ively together, and throwing up to Heaven a look of de&s;pair, fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s into my arms. JULIA would have &s;prung to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but her &s;trength was un|equal to the effort: Her maid &s;creamed for help, and &s;everal of the &s;ervants ru&s;hed into the room. We recovered the haple&s;s Montauban; he looked round wildly for a moment, then fa&s;tening his eye on JULIA&mdash;"I have murdered thee, he cried; that draught I gave thee&mdash;that draught was death!" He would have pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om; &s;he &s;unk from his embrace&mdash;her clo&s;ing eye looked piteous upon him&mdash;her hand was half &s;tretched to his&mdash;and a &s;ingle &s;igh breathed out her &s;oul to Heaven!</P>
<P>"She &s;hall not die," he cried, eagerly catch|ing hold of her hand, and bending over her life|le&s;s body with a glare of inconceivable horror in his a&s;pect. I laid hold of his arm, endeavouring
<PB N="116" REF="017578_0235_0FBA700408490478">
to draw his attention towards me; but he &s;eemed not to regard me, and continued that frightful gaze on the remains of his much injured wife. I made a &s;ign for the &s;ervants to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, and ta|king his hand began to u&s;e a gentle &s;ort of violence to lead him away. He &s;tarted back a few paces, without, however, altering the direction of his eye. "You may torture me (cried he, wildly), I can bear it all&mdash;Ha! Segarva there!&mdash;let them prove the hand-writing if they can&mdash;mark it, I &s;ay, there is no blood in her face&mdash;let me a&s;k one que&s;tion of the doctor&mdash;you know the effects of poi&s;on&mdash;her lips are white&mdash;bid Savillon ki&s;s them now&mdash;they &s;hall &s;peak no more, JULIA &s;hall &s;peak no more!"</P>
<P>Word was now brought me, that the phy&s;ician, who had been &s;ent for to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of JULIA, was arrived. He had come, alas! too late for her; but I meant to u&s;e his &s;kill on behalf of Montau|ban. I repeated my endeavours, to get him away from the dreadful object before him; and at la&s;t, though he &s;eemed not to heed the intreaties I made u&s;e of, he allowed him&s;elf to be conducted to his own apartment, where the doctor was in wait|ing. There were marks of confu&s;ion in this man's countenance which I wi&s;hed to di&s;&s;ipate. I made u&s;e of &s;ome expre&s;&s;ive looks to &s;ignify that he &s;hould appear more ea&s;y; and, a&s;&s;uming that man|ner
<PB N="117" REF="017578_0236_0FBA700621A7EBC8">
my&s;elf, begged Montauban to allow him to feel his pul&s;e.&mdash;"You come to &s;ee my wife, (&s;aid he, turning towards him)&mdash;tread &s;oftly&mdash;&s;he will do well enough when &s;he wakes. There!&mdash;(&s;tretching out his arm)&mdash;your hand trembles &s;adly; I will count the beatings my&s;elf&mdash;here is &s;omething ami&s;s; but I am not mad.&mdash;Your name is Arpentier, mine is Montauban&mdash;I am not mad."&mdash;The phy&s;ician de&s;ired him to get un|dre&s;&s;ed, and go to bed. I mean to do &s;o, for I have not &s;lept the&s;e two nights&mdash;but it is better not. Give me &s;ome potion again&s;t bad dreams&mdash;that's well thought on, that's well thought on."</P>
<P>His &s;ervant had begun to undre&s;s him. He went for a few minutes into his clo&s;et; he returned with his night-gown on, and his look appeared more thoughtful and le&s;s wild than formerly. He made a &s;light bow to the phy&s;ician: "I &s;hall &s;ee you when I ri&s;e, Sir.&mdash;Rouill&eacute;, is it not? (ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, and &s;queezing my hand)&mdash;I am not fit for talking ju&s;t now, I know I am not.&mdash;Good-night!" I left him, whi&s;pering his &s;ervant to &s;tay in the room, unperceived, if he could; but, at any rate, not to leave his ma&s;ter alone.</P>
<P>I know not how I was &s;o long able to command
<PB N="118" REF="017578_0237_0FBA700AD3676C28">
reflection. The moment I left Montauban, the horror of the &s;cene I had witne&s;&s;ed ru&s;hed upon my mind, and I remember nothing of what pa&s;&s;ed, till I found my&s;elf kneeling before the breathle&s;s remains of the ill-fated JULIA. The doctor was &s;tanding by me with a letter in his hand: It was written by Montauban, and had been found open on the table of his &s;tudy. Ar|pentier gave it me, &s;aying, it contained things which &s;hould be communicated only to the friends of the Count. From it I di&s;covered the dreadful certainty of what I had before gathered from the di&s;tracted words of Montauban. He had &s;uppo&s;ed his wife faithle&s;s, his bed di&s;honoured, and had revenged the imagined injury by poi&s;on.&mdash;My GOD! I can &s;carce, at this moment, believe that I have waked and &s;een this!</P>
<P>But his &s;ervant now came running into the room, calling for us to ha&s;ten into his ma&s;ter's chamber, for that he feared he was dead. We ru&s;hed into the room together&mdash;it was too true Montauban was no more! The doctor tried, he confe&s;&s;ed, without hope, &s;everal expedients to re|vive him; but they failed of &s;ucce&s;s. I hung over the bed, entranced in the recollection of the fate|ful events I had &s;een. Arpentier, from the habit of looking on the forms of death, was more ma|&s;ter of him&s;elf; after examining the body, and
<PB N="119" REF="017578_0238_0FBA700C2C6CD168">
pondering a little on the behaviour of the count, he went into the clo&s;et, where he found, on a &s;mall table, a phial uncorked, which he brought to me. It explained the fate of Montauban; a la|bel fa&s;tened to it, was in&s;cribed LAUDANUM; its deadly contents he had &s;wallowed in his deli|rium, before he went to bed.</P>
<P>Such was the conclu&s;ion of a life di&s;tingui&s;hed by the exerci&s;e of every manly virtue, and, except in this in&s;tance, un&s;tained with a crime. While I mourn the fate of his mo&s;t amiable wife, I recal the memory of my once dearly-valued friend, and would &s;helter it with &s;ome apology if I could. Let that honour which he wor&s;hipped plead in his defence.&mdash;That honour we have wor&s;hipped together, and I would not weaken its &s;acred voice; but I look on the body of Montauban&mdash;I weep over the pale corp&s;e of JULIA!&mdash;I &s;hudder at the &s;acrifices of mi&s;taken honour, and lift up my hands to pity and to ju&s;tice.</P>
