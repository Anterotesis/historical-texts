<P>IN a Committee of the whole Hou&s;e upon the American Papers, February 20th, 1775, Lord North made the following Motion:</P>
<P>"That it is the opinion of this Committee, that when the Governor, Council, and A&s;&s;embly, or General Court, of any of his Maje&s;ty's Provinces, or Colonies in America, &s;hall propo&s;e to make provi&s;ion, accord|ing to the condition, circum&s;tances, and &s;ituation of each Province or Colony, for contributing their proportion to the common defence; (&s;uch proportion to be rai&s;ed under the authority of the General A&s;&s;embly of &s;uch Province or Colony, and to be di&s;|po&s;able by Parliament) and &s;hall engage to make pro|vi&s;ion al&s;o for the &s;upport of the civil government, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in &s;uch Province or Colony, it will be proper, if &s;uch propo&s;al &s;hall be approved of by his Maje&s;ty and the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, for &s;o long as &s;uch provi&s;ion &s;hall be made accordingly, to forbear, in re&s;pect of &s;uch Province or Colony, to levy any duty, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment, or to impo&s;e any further duty, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment, except only &s;uch duties as it may be expedient to levy or impo&s;e, for the regulation of Commerce, the net produce of duties la&s;t mentioned, to be car|ried to the account of each Province or Colony re&s;pectively."</P>

In the cour&s;e of the debate upon the report of this re&s;oluti|on Major General Burgoyne &s;poke in &s;ub&s;tance as follows:</P>
<P>MR. SPEAKER,</P>
<P>FROM the time I have been under orders to &s;erve in America, I have thought it an unbecoming part to give my voice as a judge in any American que&s;tion, this upon your paper only excepted. But having taken &s;ome &s;hare in the debates of la&s;t year, which have been mi&s;repre&s;ented, and having appeared in &s;ome divi&s;ions this year, before I had any knowledge or &s;u&s;picion of my de&s;tination, I anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h to take this occa&s;ion to explain the motives upon which I have invariably acted: and notwith&s;tanding the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the debate, I ri&s;e with confidence in the Hou&s;e, that they will give that indulgence to my &s;ituation, which I &s;hould have little claim to upon any other preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>Sir, I think an explanation the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, both without doors and within, allu&s;ions and references are making continually to the &s;entiments of tho&s;e who are to act in the military department, a very important, but very unenviable lot.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of the licentious prints of the times, there have not been wanting &s;ugge&s;tions to the Public, that a &s;anguinary Mini&s;ter had cho&s;en the Generals be&s;t fitted by their inclina|tions to carry havock and de&s;truction through the continent of America: Within the&s;e walls we have been treated very differently, indeed; we have found an attention, a re&s;pect, a favor of opinion and of expre&s;&s;ion, that has imprinted upon my mind, and I am per&s;uaded equally upon the minds of my colleagues, a &s;incere &s;atisfaction and a deep &s;en&s;e of gratitude to Gentle|men on all &s;ides of the Hou&s;e.&mdash;But &s;till, Sir, I have ob&s;erved, through the cour&s;e of the debate&punc; an opinion to prevail, that a great latitude of orders is to be given; and that, in acting un|der
<PB N="5" REF="042784_0004_101C93BC86624700">
&s;uch latitude, we &s;hall be influenced by the &s;peeches we hear in this place, &s;ome of which are &s;uppo&s;ed to convey the mo&s;t inflammatory ideas others, ideas of the mo&s;t humiliating conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I do not know, Sir, that any &s;uch latitude will be given&mdash;at lea&s;t it will hardly extend to my inferior &s;tation. The utmo&s;t merit I &s;hall be able to claim, in this expedition, will probably be, that of an attentive, an a&s;&s;idious, circum&s;cribed obedience. But I can &s;peak with confidence of tho&s;e under whom I am to leave this country, as well as of the high and re&s;pectable officer who now commands in America; &s;uch men will not want the oratory of this Hou&s;e to give a due tone to their &s;pirit or humanity.</P>
<P>A noble &s;entiment fell from an honourable Gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colonel Barre.</NOTE> in my eye&mdash;"That bravery and compa&s;&s;ion were a&s;&s;ociate vir|tues."&mdash;May they remain blended on the minds of every military man in America!&mdash;Let the per&s;ua&s;ion uniformly prevail, that upon a review of our conduct hereafter; by our di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and impartial countrymen, our bravery will be judged by the te&s;t of our compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Should we inevitably be made the in&s;truments of puni&s;hment, let every action of the unhappy conflict be directed and marked by that temper, which ever ought to di&s;criminate the correction of the &s;tate, from the &s;udden and impetuous impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion and revenge.&mdash;But with the&s;e principles at the heart of every &s;oldier&mdash;and <HI>there</HI> they will be&mdash;for there is a charm in the very wanderings and dreams of liberty that di&s;arms an Engli&s;hman's anger&mdash;with the&s;e principles at the heart, care mu&s;t be taken, that the honour, the a&s;cendancy, the impre&s;&s;ion of the Briti&s;h arms be not in&s;ulted or dimini&s;hed in the hands of tho&s;e to whom they are intru&s;ted: and while we remember, we are contending again&s;t fellow &s;ubjects and brothers, it mu&s;t not be forgot we
<PB N="6" REF="042784_0005_101C93BFC9C8C6A8">
are contending in the cri&s;is, and for the fate, of the Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>An honourable young member<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Ackland.</NOTE> on the other &s;ide, who has entered into the army with a zeal that ju&s;tly entitles him to the e&s;teem of every officer, and who&s;e parliamentary &s;pirit and talents have this day proved him a mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition to this Hou&s;e&mdash;a&s;ked early in the dabate&mdash;Whether it could be &s;uppo&s;ed, tho&s;e Americans who denied the authority of Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, would accept the mode of Taxation propo&s;ed by the&s;e re&s;olutions? I believe they will not, and I differ with him &s;o far upon this occa&s;ion as to &s;ay, I do not like the re&s;olutions the wor&s;e upon that account. While they hold out conciliation to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to return to obedience and fidelity and mu&s;t be accepted by all rational men and well intentioned &s;ubjects, the refu&s;al of them will be as explicitly and deci&s;ively declaratory, as any manife&s;to could expre&s;s, of the principles upon which they act who continue to re&s;i&s;t, and it puts the di&s;pute upon clear ground.</P>
<P>Sir, in foreign war, the <HI>con&s;cience</HI> of the quarrel belongs to the State alone. the &s;oldier draws his &s;word with alacrity; the cau&s;e in which he engages re&s;ts between God and his Prince; and he wants no other excitements to this duty, than &s;uch as the glory of his Country, per&s;onal honour, and ju&s;t ambition will &s;ugge&s;t. In civil di&s;cord (without inquiring ca|&s;uitically whether in any or in what po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e a military &s;ervant of the Crown can be ju&s;tified, in declining a &s;ervice to which he is legally commanded) I believe a con&s;ideration of the cau&s;e will find its way to the brea&s;t of every con&s;cien|tious man, and in the execution of his duty he will feel &s;orrow and remor&s;e on one &s;ide, or &s;atisfaction and inward comfort on the other, according to the private judgment he entertains.&mdash;I perceive gentlemen on every &s;ide the hou&s;e acknowledge
<PB N="7" REF="042784_0006_101C6535EB256518">
the truth of this general ob&s;ervation.&mdash;off, I &s;hall be a&s;toni&s;hed if any gentleman denies the particular application of it.&mdash;Is there a man in England&mdash;I am confident there is not an officer or &s;oldier in the King's &s;ervice, who does not think the Parliamentary rights of Great Britain a cau&s;e to fight for, to bleed and die for? Sir, I will a&s;&s;ert, that the profe&s;&s;ed advocates of America have never ventured to meet this argu|ment fairly&mdash;They have always &s;hifted it to collateral inquiries, accu&s;ation, recrimination, and examination of the mea&s;ures by which we have been led into our pre&s;ent dilemma. Sir, pa&s;t errors may be great and manife&s;t, every admini&s;tration for ten years pa&s;t may have had their &s;hare.&mdash;It is not my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to ju&s;tify any&mdash;Inquries may be very proper at a proper time; but, as a Member of Parliament, I hold my&s;elf in|di&s;pen&s;ably called upon, to take up the que&s;tion upon this im|portant <HI>Now,</HI> this unparalleled moment in the Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory, when we tamely &s;uffer Government to be &s;u&s;pended&mdash;when we fit here the mere &s;hadow of authority&mdash;the phantom of a Parliament, a&s;&s;embling only to lament the &s;ub&s;tance we have lo&s;t, and to propo&s;e and &s;ubtili&s;e que&s;tions of our own impo|tency.</P>
<P>Sir, another method of evading a debate upon the true me|rits of this que&s;tion, has been to confound the under&s;tanding. Ingenious men will run changes upon real and virtual repre|&s;entation; external and internal taxes; revenue and regulation; till one's head grows dizzy with di&s;tinctions, and the mo&s;t gro&s;s ab&s;urdities and contradictions become for a moment &s;pecious: but it is not in rhethoric or &s;ophi&s;try to argue the great rational majority of the people of England, out of the plain, &s;imple propo&s;ition which is contained in the declaratory act of the &s;ixth of the pre&s;ent King.&mdash;The rea&s;on of the nation has been long convinced&mdash;the trial now only is, whether we have &s;pirit to &s;upport our conviction&mdash;Sir, if the whole body of the King|dom does not rou&s;e at this alarm, and &s;hake off that torpitude under which our public &s;pirit has long &s;hamefully langui&s;hed
<PB N="8" REF="042784_0007_101C93C4A41DF4D8">
&mdash;if every cla&s;s and di&s;tinction of men do not join in this great cau&s;e&mdash;if our merchants and manufacturers do not in one in|&s;tance take example from the Americans, and render it glori|ous by adapting it to a better cau&s;e&mdash;if they do not feel in&s;ult and affront in the &s;u&s;picion, that while one country dares the interruption of commerce to effectuate her chimerical claims, the other will not exert equal fortitude to vindicate her fundamental rights&mdash;if this be our wretched &s;tate&mdash;I agree, that the &s;ooner a formal &s;urrender is made, the better; let Great Britain revert to her primitive in&s;ignificancy in the map of the world, and the Congre&s;s of Philadelphia be the Legi&s;la|ture to di&s;pen&s;e the ble&s;&s;ings of Empire&mdash;Let us &s;pare the blood of our &s;ubjects, let us &s;pare the trea&s;ures of the &s;tate, but let us, at the &s;ame time, confe&s;s, we are no more a people.</P>
<P>Sir, after this avowal of my principles, it might be thought, that I &s;ought the &s;ituation in which I am going to be employed&mdash;I publickly declare I did not &s;eek it.&mdash;I will take leave to &s;ay on the part of my colleagues, it was &s;ought by none of us&mdash;but it was accepted with that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which is due from &s;ervants of the Crown, and with that &s;en&s;e of gratitude to his Maje&s;ty, which the importance of the tru&s;t required.&mdash;I feel an additional call of gratitude on my own part, for the honor my name receives in being cla&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e of the di&s;tin|gui&s;hed officers to whom I have alluded.</P>
<P>I will tre&s;pa&s;s no longer upon the time of the Hou&s;e. With the &s;entiments I have expre&s;&s;ed, I take leave of all Ameri|can que&s;tions, with the&s;e &s;entiments I &s;hall take leave of my country; I &s;hall endeavour to maintain them in arguments, if admitted to any intercour&s;e in America; I &s;hall enforce them to the be&s;t of my power, if called upon to act in the line of my profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;con&s;cientiou&s;ly covinced, that upon the due &s;up|port of them both here and on the other &s;ide the Atlantic, the exi&s;tence of this country and con&s;titution, directly, emphati|cally, and conclu&s;ively, depends.</P>
