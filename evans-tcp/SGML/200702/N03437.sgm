<P>THE ob&s;ervation of fe&s;tivals be|ing one of tho&s;e balls of con|tention, which have been to&s;s'd &s;o hotly in the religi|ous debates of this unhappy age, it may perhaps be ex|pected, that we &s;hould begin with a vindica|tion of this day's &s;olemnity, from the excep|tions that are wont to be taken again&s;t it, and that the one half of our &s;ermon &s;hould be &s;pent in apology for the other. But I
<PB N="2" REF="004195_0003_1003F85B81C0AF48">
hope we may well enough &s;pare the pains, and employ the time to better purpo&s;e; for you who are a&s;&s;embled in this hou&s;e, are per|&s;uaded, I tru&s;t, of the lawfulne&s;s of your own practice; and we cannot direct our &s;peech to tho&s;e that are ab&s;ent from it. And really it were to be wi&s;hed, that there were le&s;s noi&s;e &amp; debate about matters of this nature; and that being agreed in the more &s;ub&s;tantial parts of religion, we did all charitably ac|quie&s;ce in that excellent advice of the apo&s;tle, which he giveth in a parallel in&s;tance, <HI>Let not him that eateth, de&s;pi&s;e him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth:</HI> and then, as we &s;hall not abate any thing of that love and reverence, which we owe to the piety and truth of tho&s;e who differ from us in &s;o &s;mall matters, &s;o we might hope they would not be ha&s;ty to condemn us, if in compliance with the practice of the ancient church, and the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of our own, we take the occa&s;ion of this &s;ea&s;on, with thankfulne&s;s, to remember the greate&s;t benefit that ever was conferred on the chil|dren of men, and at this time perform that &s;ervice which can never be un&s;ea&s;onable. However, I am confident it is both more hard and nece&s;&s;ary to rectify and amend the abu&s;es of this &s;olemnity, than to ju&s;tify the right ob&s;ervation of it; to vindicate it from the di&s;honour of &s;ome of its pretended

friends, than to defend it from all the a&s;|&s;aults of aggre&s;&s;ors; and accordingly we &s;hall make it our work to per&s;uade you to &s;uch a deportment on this fe&s;tival, as may be&s;t &s;uit with the holy life and religion of that per&s;on who&s;e nativity we commemo|rate.</P>
<P>The text which we have cho&s;en may &s;eem &s;omewhat general, but yet it is ea&s;ily appli|cable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; e&s;pecially if we remember that it is an inference drawn from a prophecy, which tho' it had its lite|ral completion in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Da|vid'</HI>s throne, yet it was in a my&s;tical, and a more &s;ublime &s;en&s;e fulfilled in the incarnati|on and kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, as the apo|&s;tle in &s;everal places informeth us; <HI>for to which of the angels hath he &s;aid at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. i. 5.</NOTE>; whence he infers, that the angels them&s;elves are inferior to Chri&s;t, of whom this was &s;po|ken. The only difficulty of the words lieth in the &s;trange conjunction of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>joy</HI> and <HI>extream fear,</HI> which trembling &s;eems to import, but this will be more fully clear'd in the &s;equel of our di&s;cour&s;e. Mean while ye may ob&s;erve, that both the&s;e words, <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>trembling,</HI> are u&s;ed in the text, and in the
<PB N="4" REF="004195_0005_1003F7455C6CDEE8">
&s;cripture phra&s;e, u&s;ually import humility, and diligence, &s;olicitude and caution, and the fear of di&s;plea&s;ing, as being the mo&s;t proper qualifications of our obedience, either to God or man. Thus we are commanded to <HI>work out our &s;alvation with fear and trem|bling</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 10.</NOTE>; and &s;ervants are commanded to <HI>obey their ma&s;ters with fear and trembling</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 5.</NOTE>; &s;o the <HI>Corinthians</HI> are &s;aid to have <HI>received Titus being &s;ent to them, with fear and trembling</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vii. 15.</NOTE>; and <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> &s;aith of the angels, that they a&s;&s;i&s;t with <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>trembling.</HI> All which places do import &s;uch care and diligence, as are very nece&s;&s;ary and reconcileable to chearful &s;ervice. Reverence and fear to of|fend will be happily join'd with holy joy in the performance of our duty, there being nothing more plea&s;ant than to &s;erve him diligently whom we reverence, and fear to di&s;plea&s;e. Thus much for the explication. The text is too &s;hort to be divided into ma|ny parts, but doth naturally fall a&s;under in|to two, the former exciting and encouraging our joy, the latter qualifying and moderat|ing the &s;ame. Fir&s;t we are allowed, yea and commanded to rejoice, and then we are caution'd to do it with trembling, and ac|cordingly our di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall run in the&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="004195_0006_1003F71E54683670">
two heads; fir&s;t to exhort you to chearful|ne&s;s and joy, then to &s;et the right bounds and limits to the &s;ame; and having done this in general, we &s;hall endeavour to draw both the&s;e home to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t. Joy and chear|fulne&s;s are &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with religion, when rightly ordered, that we find them many times allowed and recommend|ed in &s;cripture. Thus in the la&s;t ver&s;e of the <HI>32d P&s;alm, Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous: and &s;hout for joy all ye that are upright in heart:</HI> And in ver&s;e 1. of the next <HI>P&s;alm, Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous, for prai&s;e is comely for the upright.</HI> So <HI>P&s;.</HI> xxxviii. 3. <HI>Let the righteous be glad, let them rejoice before the Lord, yea, let them exceedingly rejoice. P&s;alm</HI> cxlix. 5. <HI>Let the &s;aints be joyful in glory! let them &s;ing aloud on their beds.</HI> And that you may not think this a liberty proper only for the former di&s;pen&s;ations, but the chri&s;tians obliged to greater &s;everity, the apo&s;tle doth no le&s;s than three times give this admoniti|on to the <HI>Philippians, Rejoice in the Lord, rejoice always in the Lord, yea, I &s;ay rejoice;</HI> in rela|tion to this perhaps it was, that the old her|mit <HI>Palladius,</HI> having 500 &s;cholars, u&s;ed ne|ver to di&s;mi&s;s them without this admoniti|on, <HI>My friends be chearful; forget not, I be&s;eech you, to be chearful:</HI> this was the con&s;tant lecture he repeated, as often as St. <HI>John</HI> was
<PB N="6" REF="004195_0007_1003F865292D4A50">
wont to do the&s;e words, <HI>My little children, love one another.</HI></P>
<P>None of our natural inclinations were made in vain, and joy is neither an u&s;ele&s;s, nor a &s;mall pa&s;&s;ion, but if rightly ordered, may become an eminent exerci&s;e of religion, as proper a concomitant of thankfulne&s;s, as &s;orrow of repentance. Our devotion never &s;oareth higher, than when it is carried on the wings of joy and love, when our &s;ouls are filled with the &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, and we heartily applaud the <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, and all the prai&s;es of the crea|tures; and as joy is an excellent in&s;trument of devotion, &s;o a con&s;tant &s;erenity &amp; cheer|fulne&s;s of &s;pirit is a fit di&s;po&s;ition for our other duties: I &s;hould be loath to counte|nance any levity or di&s;&s;olution of &s;pirit, and I hope, before we have done, we &s;hall leave no ground to &s;u&s;pect &s;uch a de&s;ign: and yet I would not have you imagine, that inno|cence and &s;everity are in&s;eparable compani|ons, or that a free and chearful countenance is a certain &s;ign of an ill mind, or that men ought always to be &s;ad under the notion of being &s;erious I would not have you in love with a &s;tudied face, nor think it a crime to laugh, or &s;crupulou&s;ly to refu&s;e &s;uch inno|cent and ingenuous diverti&s;ements, as you find u&s;eful to refre&s;h your &s;pirits, and pre|&s;erve their alacrity; for chearfulne&s;s enlight|ens
<PB N="7" REF="004195_0008_1003F8291830B7F0">
the mind, and encourages the heart, and rai&s;eth the &s;oul (as it were) to breathe in a purer air: it misbecomes none but the wick|ed, in whom it is commonly a light mirth, and fooli&s;h jollity; as a curious dre&s;s may &s;et off an hand&s;ome face, which yet will render tho&s;e who are ugly, more ill-favour|ed: &s;o doth chearfulne&s;s exceedingly become good &s;ouls; in bad men it is mo&s;t ridiculous. On the other hand, a &s;ad and &s;ullen humour, a dumpi&s;h, moro&s;e, and melancholy di&s;po&s;i|tion is &s;o far from being commendable, that at be&s;t it mu&s;t be look'd upon as an infirmity and weakne&s;s in the be&s;t of tho&s;e in whom it re&s;ideth, and if purpo&s;ely affected or che|ri&s;hed, may de&s;erve a &s;everer cen&s;ure, being di&s;honourable to God, injurious to our neigh|bours, prejudicial to our &s;elves, and a thing highly unrea&s;onable. Fir&s;t, it is di&s;honour|able to God, on whom we profe&s;s to depend, and who thro' our moro&s;ene&s;s may be mi&s;|taken for a hard and &s;evere ma&s;ter: If you &s;hould ob&s;erve any man's &s;ervant to be al|ways &s;ad and dejected, and could not gue&s;s at the rea&s;on of it, you would be ready to conclude, that they were ill treated at home, and &s;erved an unkind tyrannical per&s;on: and therefore if we have any regard to the hon|our of our ma&s;ter, we ought carefully to a|void any thing from which tho&s;e that are &s;trangers to him, are apt to take occa&s;ion to
<PB N="8" REF="004195_0009_1003F751FAFE7E48">
entertain har&s;h and di&s;advantageous tho'ts of him and his &s;ervice. Again, it is injuri|ous to our neighbours, whom it doth deprive of the comforts of &s;ociety, and the innocent delights of more chearful conver&s;e, it being better to be confined to &s;olitude, than oblig|ed to live with tho&s;e who are always &s;ullen. They are not like to be good company to o|thers who are &s;o bad company to them&s;elves; nor will they ea&s;ily endure to &s;ee others chearful and plea&s;ant, when they cannot al|low them&s;elves &s;o much as to &s;mile. Pee|vi&s;hne&s;s and anger are the ordinary compa|nions of melancholy, and it is hard for &s;er|vants and friends to plea&s;e them in any thing who are accu&s;tom'd to &s;adne&s;s and di&s;con|tent. But this is not all, there is a greater mi&s;chief in the matter, for they who are &s;trangers to religion, and ob&s;erve them who pretend to it to be always &s;ad and melan|choly are thereby deterr'd from the &s;tudy of piety, as that which would imbitter their lives, &amp; deprive them of all their comforts; and they are apt to imagine, that if once they &s;hould undertake a cour&s;e of godline&s;s, they &s;hould never after enjoy a plea&s;ant hour, but by a melancholy humour, and au&s;tere behaviour, become a burden to them&s;elves, and a burden to all about them. Then they will think devotion a comfortle&s;s employ|ment, when they &s;ee men come from retire|ments
<PB N="9" REF="004195_0010_1003F727E198E420">
with &s;ad and heavy looks, moro&s;e and untowardly deportment; whereas really the &s;pirit of religion is in it &s;elf mo&s;t amiable, and mo&s;t lively, mo&s;t chearful, free and inge|nious, and it is only mens weakne&s;s, and not their piety, that ought to be blam'd for any &s;uch di&s;order in their minds.</P>
<P>Again, melancholy and &s;adne&s;s is prejudi|cial to our &s;elves, being an enemy to nature, and hurtful to bodily con&s;titutions, e&s;peci|ally when it grows prevalent and extreme, and therefore men are oblig'd to be chearful for the &s;ame rea&s;ons they take phy&s;ick, and to guard again&s;t melancholy as we would do again&s;t a di&s;ea&s;e. Be&s;ides, it is very trou|ble&s;ome to our &s;pirits, and will make us &s;mart even when we know not why: altho' melancholy mu&s;ings may be a very delightful entertainment to the mind, yet in a little time they grow to be very trouble&s;ome, con|trary to the nature of other births, they plea&s;e us much while we bring them forth, but prove a mi&s;erable torment when they are born. But which is much wor&s;e, it doth ex|ceedingly indi&s;po&s;e for the duties of religi|on. The eyes are not more darkned with fumes and vapours, than the under&s;tanding is, when tho&s;e &s;udden exhalations gather a|bout us. Clogs are not a greater impediment to the feet, than this humour to the motions of the &s;oul; it inclines not only to think
<PB N="10" REF="004195_0011_1003F866D9AEE3E0">
wor&s;e of our &s;elves, and our condition, than we need, but to do wor&s;e than otherwi&s;e we &s;hould. It repre&s;ents tho&s;e things as ex|ceedingly difficult which may be done with ea&s;e, and tho&s;e impo&s;&s;ible which have any con&s;iderable difficulty. It quite di&s;pirits us, and will not &s;uffer us to attempt any thing, becau&s;e we imagine we can do nothing; al|though perhaps in a heat it may pu&s;h us for|ward, yet it &s;uddenly &s;tays us, and makes us think we cannot go; if it catcheth fire it makes us wild, and when it hath &s;pent that flame, it leaves us dead and lumpi&s;h.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, &s;adne&s;s and dejection of &s;pirit in chri&s;tians, is a thing very unrea&s;onable; for why &s;hould they be &s;ad and heavy who &s;erve &s;o good a ma&s;ter, and who are a&s;&s;ur'd of an infinite reward for their faithful &s;ervice? If the favour of a prince, or hopes of &s;ome earthly advantage, can &s;upport and chear the minds of men, why &s;hould not religious people, who have the friend&s;hip of God, and &s;o many divine ble&s;&s;ings in pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the certain expectation of more and greater, cheri&s;h a perpetual joy, and ever be of good comfort? What &s;hould af|flict them, or ca&s;t them down? Is it world|ly cro&s;&s;es or fears? They have not their portions in things of this world, they are &s;trangers and pilgrims on earth, and cannot in rea&s;on be much &s;olicitous about their
<PB N="11" REF="004195_0012_1003F83240F066F8">
accommodation in an inn, which they are &s;o &s;hortly to leave. Be&s;ides, where is he that doth not enjoy more and greater com|forts than tho&s;e he is deprived and &s;tands in need of? Why then &s;hould&s;t thou not be more glad of what thou ha&s;t, than &s;orry for what thou wante&s;t? Perhaps thou ha&s;t lo&s;t part of thy fortune, but yet enjoye&s;t more than many who live happily enough not|with&s;tanding: thou wante&s;t money, but thou ha&s;t thy health; if that be impaired, thou enjoye&s;t the u&s;e of thy rea&s;on, which is infinitely more valuable; thou ha&s;t lo&s;t a friend, but perhaps thou ha&s;t many behind, and &s;hall that lo&s;s do more to make thee &s;ad, than all the re&s;t to make thee chearful; or wilt thou, like a peevi&s;h child, throw all a|way, becau&s;e &s;omething is taken from thee? I &s;ay not that moderate &s;adne&s;s is blameable on &s;uch occa&s;ions, but that our grief ought not to be indulged till it grow habitual; and &s;ure whatever our cro&s;&s;es and our fears be, we ought chearfully to acquie&s;ce in a con&s;tant dependance on the divine provi|dence; having that infinite wi&s;dom &amp; good|ne&s;s, and power, which made, and doth go|vern the world, to care for us, and the pro|mi&s;e of God for all tho&s;e things which he &s;ees nece&s;&s;ary or convenient for us. What is it then that &s;hould deject us, and deprive us of that joy which the text alloweth and
<PB N="12" REF="004195_0013_1003F75A9DC575C0">
commendeth? Is it the &s;en&s;e of our weak|ne&s;s, and the fear of mi&s;&s;ing that eternal happine&s;s for which we were creat<HI>e</HI>d? If thou be altogether gracele&s;s, &s;uch thoughts would &s;eldom trouble thee; but if thou be really concerned in religion, and have a mind to heaven in earne&s;t, if thou ha&s;t begun thy race, and art pre&s;&s;ing forward to obtain thy prize, thou ha&s;t no rea&s;on to be di&s;couraged or ca&s;t down; God loves thee better than thou do&s;t either him or thy &s;elf, and holi|ne&s;s is the genuine i&s;&s;ue of the divine nature, and therefore he cannot hide his face from it, he cannot de&s;ert it as an outca&s;t thing in the world, nay he is ready to cheri&s;h and a&s;&s;i&s;t it, and perfect that gracious work which him&s;elf hath begun. Away then with ground|le&s;s fears and di&s;pondent thoughts which di&s;honour God, &amp; weaken your own hands; encourage your &s;elves with the a&s;&s;urance of the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and chearfully perform that which is incumbent upon your &s;elves, check the &s;adne&s;s of your &s;pirits, and chide your &s;elf into better temper, as <HI>David</HI> did, in <HI>P&s;alms</HI> xlii &amp; xliii, he took up his droop|ing mind with this encouragement, <HI>Why art thou ca&s;t down, O my Soul,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But perhaps you will tell me, that chear|ful temper which we recommend, is very improper for the&s;e bad times wherein we live; and tho' we had no trouble on account
<PB N="13" REF="004195_0014_1003F836B4067F28">
of our intere&s;ts, the mi&s;eries of others might oblige us to &s;adne&s;s, and blunt and damp all our joys: I an&s;wer, compa&s;&s;ion indeed is a chri&s;tian virtue, and a good man will be con|cerned in the mi&s;eries under which he &s;ees his neighbour groan, &amp; be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his council, his labour, or his pur&s;e, if that will relieve him; but he is not obliged to &s;uffer the calamities of others to &s;ink &s;o deeply into his &s;pirit, as to di&s;turb the peace and harmony of his &s;oul; el&s;e &s;ince the world is a great ho&s;pital of mi&s;ery, and we &s;ee well nigh as many mi&s;erable per&s;ons as men, we mu&s;t needs draw as much mi&s;ery on our &s;elves, as all theirs doth amount to, and &s;o de&s;erve more compa&s;&s;ion than any of them. Again, if we partake of the mi&s;eries of others, &s;o may we in their happine&s;s; if we ought to mourn with tho&s;e that mourn, &s;o we ought to re|joice with them that rejoice; &amp; tho' mi&s;ery is far more frequent in the world than hap|pine&s;s, this can be no mea&s;ure for the whole creation; and for any thing we know, for one &s;inful wretch there may be ten thou&s;and holy and happy &s;pirits. However, all the mi&s;ery in the world carries no proportion to the in|finite happine&s;s of Almighty God, which ought to be the highe&s;t object of our joy, and may drown and &s;wallow up all the excu&s;es or pretences of exce&s;&s;ive &s;adne&s;s. We ought to rejoice in God, not only that he is our God, but that he is God infinitely holy, and
<PB N="14" REF="004195_0015_1003F86BCDBA05D8">
infinitely happy, that he is &s;elf-ble&s;&s;ed, glori|ous in all things, &amp; that his enemies cannot reach nor un&s;ettle his throne, this is the mo&s;t certain, and con&s;tant, the mo&s;t pure and hea|venly joy.</P>
<P>There remaineth yet one occa&s;ion of grief, which &s;ome may think enough to bani&s;h all joy from a chri&s;tian &s;oul, &amp; that is the mul|titude of &s;ins whereof we &amp; others are guilty; and certainly contrition &amp; zeal for the hon|our of God, are very nece&s;&s;ary duties; yet we were not born only to mourn, nor is the la|menting of &s;in all we have to do in the world: we love to &s;ee a &s;ervant &s;en&s;ible of his fault, but would be ill content if on that account he did nothing but weep. Sadne&s;s in con|trition is nece&s;&s;ary to make our repentance &s;erious, &amp; &s;adne&s;s of zeal to te&s;tify our con|cernment in God's intere&s;t, but on neither of the&s;e accounts ought we to grieve without term or mea&s;ure. As we ought to grieve that we have offended &s;o gracious a God, &s;o ought we to rejoice that the God whom we have of|fended is &s;o gracious; and &s;ince the greatne&s;s of God's mercy is as far above our &s;ins, as the heavens are above the earth, our faith and joy in God's mercy ought to be far above our &s;adne&s;s for our &s;ins. Whereas the bla&s;|phemies and oppo&s;itions of God's enemies, by his wi&s;dom and power, &s;hall turn to his glory our &s;adne&s;s for the&s;e oppo&s;itions mu&s;t end in joy, for the almighty power and &s;o|vereign
<PB N="15" REF="004195_0016_1003F83B9438ECF8">

<P>By this time I hope it doth appear, that joy and chearfulne&s;s are more allowable in chri&s;tians, than &s;ome men perhaps are ready to imagine. I &s;hall add no more to this pur|po&s;e, but that it is the privilege of a holy and religious &s;oul, that every thing he meets with may afford him occa&s;ion of joy; if he looks up to heaven, it puts him in mind of the man&s;ions that are preparing for him; if on the earth, it rejoiceth him to think of his intere&s;t in him who made and governs the &s;ame: if he con&s;iders the changes and revo|lutions of human affairs, it &s;atisfies him to remember that an unerring providence doth over-rule all their &s;eeming di&s;orders, and makes them all &s;erve to great and glorious de&s;igns; if he live long, he is glad of the large time he is allowed to do his work in; and if he die &s;oon, he is glad that he is &s;o &s;oon come to the end &amp; reward of his work; if he be richer than his neighbours, he re|joiceth in the opportunity of obliging them; and if they be richer than he, he rejoiceth that they have the plenty &amp; &s;plendor which riches afford; and that he wants the care and temptations that attend them. As many mi&s;eries as he &s;eeth, &s;o many arguments he hath to glorify God, and rejoice in his good|ne&s;s, &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ed be God that I am not

maim'd like that begging &s;oldier, nor fran|tick like the Bedlamite; nor in pri&s;on like that bankrupt; nor like the thief in the &s;hackles; nor in perpetual trouble like that coun&s;ellor of &s;tate.</P>
<P>But joy is a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o plea&s;ing unto nature, that mo&s;t men are ea&s;ily per&s;uaded unto it, tho&s;e e&s;pecially who have lea&s;t ground for it; and what we have &s;aid hitherto, may have the ill luck to be mi&s;taken or wre&s;ted by pro|fane per&s;ons, for the defence of their jollity and frolick&s;ome mirth: But it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that our exhortation to chear|fulne&s;s and joy, pre&s;uppo&s;eth men to be good and religious, and is addre&s;&s;ed to them on that pre&s;umption; for we &s;hould never en|courage men to rejoice and be chearful, while they are at enmity with their maker, at feud with the infinite Maje&s;ty of heaven, who&s;e lea&s;t frown is enough to confound them. We would not leave men to dance on the brinks of hell, nor wantonly exult in the way that leads to de&s;truction; another temper would better become their unhappy condition, and they ought to be thinking how a timely &s;or|row may lay a &s;ure foundation for a la&s;ting joy. Again, the joy which we commend, is a quite different thing from the levity and di&s;&s;olution of &s;pirit, which &s;ome per&s;ons would cover under that name. We allow not that light airy temper that is incon&s;i&s;tent with gravity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s; we would not
<PB N="17" REF="004195_0018_1003F83FEE4B6CD8">
have a man's life become a &s;port, nor mirth to become his whole employment; of &s;uch laughter we may &s;ay with the wi&s;e man, <HI>that it is mad, and of mirth, what doth it?</HI> The chear|fulne&s;s we have been &s;peaking of, mu&s;t &s;pring from the &s;en&s;e of the divine goodne&s;s, &amp; the con&s;cience of our &s;incerity in his &s;ervice; tho' we are not to refu&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of in|nocent acts to rai&s;e and recruit our natural &s;pirits when they faint and fail within us. Finally, that our chearfulne&s;s and joy may be allowable, it mu&s;t be rightly temper'd; which leads me to the &s;econd part of the text, which if it do not check, it doth at lea&s;t mix and qualify our joy; rejoice we may, but it mu&s;t be with trembling. Trembling is a natural effect and &s;ign of fear, and is here put for the thing &s;ignified. Now fear may &s;eem to be the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s and unprofitable pa&s;&s;ion in the mind, it is that which pre&s;ages mi&s;chief, and anticipates our mi&s;eries, giving them a being before they had any, and trou|bling us with the apprehen&s;ion of tho&s;e evils which may never befal us, and hindring us to guard again&s;t many which we might have prevented; betraying tho&s;e &s;uccors which rea&s;on offereth, as the wi&s;e &s;on of <HI>David</HI> tells us. The hi&s;torian &s;peaking of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> who in their flight flung away their weapons of defence, addeth this ob&s;ervation, <HI>Adco ti|mor ip&s;a auxilia reformidat;</HI> &s;uch is the nature of fear, that it not only makes us flee from
<PB N="18" REF="004195_0019_1003F87448B602D0">
danger, but from tho&s;e helps and &s;uccours which &s;hould keep it off. But as <HI>Alexander</HI> &s;aid of his fierce and &s;tately hor&s;e, <HI>qualem i&s;ti equum perdunt, dum eo per imperitiam uti ne&s;ci|unt,</HI> what a brave hor&s;e is lo&s;t for want of skill to manage him; &s;o we may &s;ay of fear, that they who would di&s;charge it, do lo&s;e an u&s;eful pa&s;&s;ion, not knowing how to order it. Fear doubtle&s;s is an excellent in&s;trument, both of rea&s;on, and of religion, and as all our pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o e&s;pecially fear, are as winds, which altho' they &s;ometimes drive us upon rocks, yet rightly improved may &s;well our &s;ails, and carry us on to the haven where we would be. Hence we find it &s;o frequently commanded in &s;cripture, and &s;o profitably practi&s;ed by wi&s;e and holy per&s;ons. The que&s;tion then is, what kind of fear and trem|bling is enjoin'd here in the text. And fir&s;t, as for the object, certainly the wrath &amp; di&s;|plea&s;ure of God is the mo&s;t proper and &s;ui|table object of our fear; it is this that we ought to look on as the greate&s;t evil, and to &s;hun with the greate&s;t care: and this fear, if rightly &s;eated in our &s;ouls, will make us watchful again&s;t the &s;maller &s;ins, and make us heartily &s;orry for the offences of others. But tho' the fear of God's di&s;plea&s;ure be more excellent and u&s;eful, yet the fear of our own mi&s;ery is not to be condemned. It is u&s;eful not only to wicked per&s;ons, whom tho' it do not make good, yet it keeps them from being

wor&s;e; but al&s;o to holy per&s;ons, whom the fear of hell hath many times helped forward to heaven. Our Saviour him&s;elf advi&s;eth us, to <HI>fear him who can ca&s;t both body and &s;oul into hell-fire;</HI> and that we may not forget it, he drives it home with an ingemination, <HI>yea, I &s;ay unto you fear him;</HI> where we are to ob|&s;erve, that <HI>qui</HI> imports as much as <HI>quia;</HI> the de&s;cription of the per&s;on carrieth the rea&s;on for which we ought to fear him. It were indeed to be wi&s;hed, that our &s;ouls were knit unto God by the more noble and generous pa&s;&s;ion of love, and that we needed neither rewards to draw us to our duty, nor puni&s;h|ments to cha&s;e us to our happine&s;s; and that we loved goodne&s;s as <HI>Cato</HI> was &s;aid to do virtue, becau&s;e he could not do otherwi&s;e; but this is with the hi&s;torian, <HI>votum accom|modare non hi&s;toriam,</HI> to pre&s;ent a wi&s;h rather than a character of an ordinary chri&s;tian; or as <HI>Xenophon</HI> did with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> to de&s;cribe ra|ther what he &s;hould be, than what he is; <HI>perfect love,</HI> as St. <HI>John</HI> tells us, <HI>ca&s;teth out all fear;</HI> but while our love is imperfect, it leaves room for &s;ome fear. Hell is certainly in our creed as well as heaven, and as the fear of it is ordinarily the fir&s;t &s;tep of conver&s;ion, &s;o it may be of u&s;e to quicken us, and pu&s;h us forward all along thro' our journey toward heaven. But if chri&s;tians fear may have hell for its object, what kind of fear may this be? In a word, it ought not to be &s;uch an anxious

and trouble&s;ome fear, as may di&s;turb our tranquility, or extingui&s;h our joy, or di&s;|courage our endeavours, but &s;o rational and mode&s;t, as may make us reverend in our love, and mode&s;t in our confidence, and cautious in our joy, that it neither betray us to, nor vent it &s;elf in any un&s;eemly expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>And thus much of the duty recommended in the text. 'Tis high time now to apply the&s;e general to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. We are a&s;&s;embled this day to commemorate the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing that ever was be&s;towed on the children of men; a ble&s;&s;ing wherein all the nations of the world are concern'd, and yet who&s;e fruits do as entirely redound to every good man, as if it had been de&s;ign'd for him alone: a mercy that doth at once a&s;toni&s;h and rejoice the angels, who in com|pari&s;on of us are unconcern'd in it. The&s;e <HI>mountains</HI> do leap for joy, becau&s;e the <HI>valleys</HI> were filled with a fruitful &s;hower, for when tho&s;e glorious &s;pirits did behold God &s;toop|ing to the condition of a man, &amp; man rai&s;ed above the lowline&s;s of his &s;tate, and the hap|pine&s;s of all the angels, they were tran&s;port|ed with the admiration of the my&s;tery and joy, for the felicity of their fellow-creatures; and did with the greate&s;t chearfulne&s;s per|form the emba&s;les they were &s;ent upon in this great affair. For having before adver|ti&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ed virgin of her miraculous conception, le&s;t her mode&s;ty &s;hould have
<PB N="21" REF="004195_0022_1003F847EF1F6678">
been offended at &s;o &s;trange an accident, and having removed the &s;u&s;picion of her betroth|ed husband, they rejoiced to bring the fir&s;t news of that infinite mercy which we remem|ber this day: for as <HI>certain &s;hepherds were feed|ing their flocks by night, an angel of the Lord ap|peared unto them, and the glory of the Lord &s;hone round about them;</HI> and when this glorious ap|pearance had confounded their &s;en&s;es, &amp; al|mo&s;t &s;cattered their under&s;tanding, the angel &s;aid unto them, <HI>Fear not for behold I bring unto you tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be unto all peo|ple; for unto you is born this day in the city of Da|vid, a Saviour, which is Chri&s;t the Lord; and &s;uddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly ho&s;t,</HI> the whole choir of glorious &s;pirits, who all join'd in this heavenly an|them, <HI>Glory to God on high, on earth peace, and good-will towards men.</HI> And may not that help to heighten &amp; advance our joy &amp; our thank|fulne&s;s? Can we be in&s;en&s;ible of our happi|ne&s;s, when angels do &s;o heartily congratulate it? 'Tis a nativity which we celebrate, &amp; any birth doth much rejoice per&s;ons intere&s;ted; a woman forgets her pangs when a man|child is born into the world.</P>
<P>But that our joy and thankfulne&s;s may be more excited, we &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the ex|cellency of the per&s;on who was born; &s;e|condly, the de&s;ign of his birth; and thirdly, glance a little at the circum&s;tances of it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, he was no common &amp; ordinary
<PB N="22" REF="004195_0023_1003F87D30C89DF0">
per&s;on who&s;e birth occa&s;ions our joy: if we &s;hall but fix our eyes on his humane nature, and con&s;ider tho&s;e excellencies that were ob|vious to the eyes of the world, we &s;hall yet acknowledge, that never &s;uch a per&s;on ap|peared on the face of the earth. It is he who&s;e nativity was promi&s;ed immediately after the fall, and &s;o exactly pointed at by the prophets many hundred years before it hap|pen'd, that the <HI>Jews</HI> could tell the place, and the very heathens had &s;ome knowledge of the time; for the world was big with ex|pectation, that the prophecies &s;hould then be fulfilled which foretold the birth of a great per&s;on. La&s;tly, it is he who&s;e very infancy not only &s;tartled a king, and made him fear his throne&punc; but al&s;o affrighted the powers of darkne&s;s, and &s;ilenced the heathen oracles, <HI>ille puer Hebraeus,</HI> &amp;c. who&s;e childhood puz|zled the knowledge of the aged, &amp; confound|ed the doctors of the law; who ruled the the cour&s;e of nature &amp; made the &s;trong winds obey him, and could walk on the billows of the &s;eas as on a pavement; who fed multi|tudes by his word, and healed all manner of di&s;ea&s;es without medicine; who could com|mand them to leap that were cripple, and make them &s;ee the heavens and the day, who had been born blind; &amp; who could ca&s;t de|vils out of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &amp; re&s;tore the fran|rick to their wits; who could break the gates of death, &amp; open the doors of the grave and call back the &s;pirits to the buried carca&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004195_0024_1003F84E473EB898">
It is he who by the mini&s;try of twelve fi|&s;hermen, made his religion, tho' contrary to the corrupt affections, and carnal intere&s;ts of men, quickly &s;ubdue the known world, and made it &s;ubmit to a crucified king. The doc|trine which he taught, ma&s;ter'd the under|&s;tanding of the mo&s;t learned philo&s;ophers, conquer'd the &s;pirits of the mo&s;t valiant commanders, and out-witted the cunning of the &s;ubtle&s;t politicians, it cancell'd the cere|monies of the <HI>Jews,</HI> confounded the wi&s;dom of the <HI>Greek,</HI> and in&s;tructed the rudene&s;s of the <HI>Barbarian;</HI> &amp; remains &s;till in the world a con&s;tant evidence of the author's wi&s;dom and power. And what &s;hall we &s;peak of the goodne&s;s and moral endowments of that hu|mane nature, which were as miraculous as his power: Nay, all his miracles were in|&s;tances of the one as well as of the other. Should we &s;peak of his ardent piety and de|votion, his love to God, and his zeal for his honour, his amiable meekne&s;s and humility, his univer&s;al charity &amp; compa&s;&s;ion even to|ward his bitter enemies, his venerable purity and temperance, that noble contempt of the world, &amp; all tho&s;e other virtues which &s;hined &s;o eminently in his whole conver&s;ation; a &s;ermon were too little for every particular. But this is not all, he was not only far above other men, but infinitely above the angels, being per&s;onally united to the divine nature; he was God as well as man, and by commu|nication
<PB N="24" REF="004195_0025_1003F87EB3A7BD58">
of properties, it may be &s;aid, that he whom we now behold in a cradle, hath his throne in the heaven, and filleth all things by his immen&s;ity; that he who is wrapt in &s;wadling clothes, is now cloathed in infinite glory; and he whom we find in a &s;table a|mong bea&s;ts, is the &s;ame with him encircled with millions of angels; in a word, that great per&s;on who&s;e nativity we celebrate, is divine|ly embodied, <HI>God made fle&s;h.</HI> This union of the divine and humane nature, is a my&s;tery great enough to confound our under&s;tand|ing, but not to trouble or &s;hake our faith, who know how they are, and are not able to give any account of the union betwixt the &s;oul &amp; the body, or of the parts of nature among them &s;elves, which yet we never call in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>And thus much of the dignity of Chri&s;t's per&s;on, which is the fir&s;t ground of our joy; we proceed to the &s;econd, the de&s;ign of his birth. He was Lord of the world, but came not into it to exerci&s;e dominion, nor as the <HI>Jews</HI> expected, to procure their temporal re|demption, and re&s;tore the kingdom to <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> He came not for &s;o mean a purpo&s;e as the <HI>Jews</HI> expected, to procure their temporal re|demption, to make his followers rich and honourable, fortunate or con&s;picuous in the world; nay, both by precept and example he taught them to contemn and de&s;pi&s;e all &s;uch empty trifles: but he came to deliver his peo|ple from everla&s;ting de&s;truction, &amp; from the
<PB N="25" REF="004195_0026_1003F7495B7D9518">
captivity of &s;in, and to teach them how by a holy life they might obtain an endle&s;s happi|ne&s;s. He came not indeed to purcha&s;e us li|berty to &s;in, without hazard, &amp; then to cover all our iniquities with his righteou&s;ne&s;s, to let us live as we li&s;t, and a&s;&s;ure us of pardon. Nay, it had neither been con&s;i&s;tent with his love to God, to have procur'd pardon for ob&s;tinate and incorrigible rebels; nor &s;o great a benefit to us to have obtain'd remi&s;|&s;ion without &s;anctification: Had we been deliver'd from all other puni&s;hment, &s;in it &s;elf would have made us mi&s;erable. But Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave his peo|ple from their &s;ins, <HI>Mat.</HI> i. 21. as well as from the di&s;mal con&s;equences of them; and to procure for us, <HI>that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might &s;erve him without fear, in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s before him,</HI> Luke i. 12. In a word, Chri&s;t came into the world to advance the glory of God, &amp; the happi|ne&s;s of the earth, by re&s;toring us to the fa|vour of our maker, and a conformity to him. And certainly if we have any &s;en&s;e of the evil of &s;in, or the mi&s;ery of hell, of the beauty of holine&s;s, or the glory of heaven, it mu&s;t needs be a matter of great joy to celebrate the birth of him, who doth deliver us from the one, and gives us a&s;&s;urance of the other.</P>
<P>It remaineth yet that we &s;peak of the cir|cum&s;tances of the nativity which we cele|brate; and many things pre&s;ent them&s;elves
<PB N="26" REF="004195_0027_1003F880384DCD98">
full of comfort and in&s;truction. We &s;hall only ob&s;erve our Saviour's coming into the world after that manner, which did be&s;t &s;uit with his de&s;ign. Indeed when a man &s;hould hear of the Son of God's coming down from heaven, &amp; making a progre&s;s into the lower world, he would be apt to think that his appearance would be with the greate&s;t &s;plen|dor and magnificence, and that the glory of heaven &s;hould continually attend and &s;igna|lize his per&s;on: at lea&s;t, that all the princes in the world &s;hould be &s;ummon'd to attend his reception, and that the heaven &s;hould bow at his pre&s;ence, and the earth tremble at the approach of his Maje&s;ty, and that all the clouds &s;hould clap together in an uni|ver&s;al thunder, to welcome his appearance; in&s;tead of all this pomp and grandeur, he &s;lips into the world (as they &s;ay) <HI>incognito,</HI> is born in a village, di&s;cover'd by &s;ome poor &s;hepherds, and found by them in a &s;table, and &s;uch an homely cradle as that afforded, only attended by his poor mother, who, tho' of royal blood, had nothing but goodne&s;s to make her eminent; and his education was an&s;werable to his ob&s;cure birth, &amp; his whole life a cour&s;e of humility and &s;elf-denial&punc; Now certainly this far be&s;t agrees with the de&s;ign of his appearance, who came not on &s;o mean an errand as to dazzle the eyes of mankind with the appearance of his glory, nor to amaze them with the terriblene&s;s of
<PB N="27" REF="004195_0028_1003F84FF87C01B8">
his Maje&s;ty, much le&s;s to make a &s;hew of the riches and gallantry of the world among them but to <HI>bring life and immortality to light,</HI> and lead men to eternal happine&s;s. In order to which it was nece&s;&s;ary, that by his ex|ample, as well as doctrine, he &s;hould di&s;pa|rage the vanities of the world, and bring them out of that credit and e&s;teem they had gotten among fooli&s;h men.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed no further on this &s;ubject; I hope it doth appear, that we have great rea&s;on to rejoice in the exaltation of the hu|mane nature, and the great &s;alvation pur|cha&s;ed to us by the incarnation of the Son of God. I &s;hall add, that even this joy ad|mits of holy fear, even on this occa&s;ion we mu&s;t rejoice with trembling. Salvation is come into the world, but wo to them that neglect it! The go&s;pel is preached, but there is great danger in &s;lighting it, let us therefore fear, <HI>le&s;t a promi&s;e being left us of en|tring into his re&s;t, any of us &s;hould come &s;hort of it,</HI> Heb. iv. 1. Little cau&s;e have ob&s;tinate &s;inners to rejoice on this fe&s;tival, the time is coming that they &s;hall wi&s;h, that either Chri&s;t had never come into the world, or they had never heard of him: <HI>Behold, this child is &s;et for the ri&s;e and fall of many,</HI> Luke ii 34. And they that are not the better, &s;hall be the wor&s;e for his coming. One way I mu&s;t name, that many men &s;et this child for their own fall, when they make this &s;olemn

anniver&s;ary, an opportunity of &s;inning &amp; de|bauchery, as if it were indeed a drunken <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and not a <HI>holy Je&s;us,</HI> whom they wor&s;hipped. What, Sirs, becau&s;e God be|came man, mu&s;t we therefore become bea&s;ts? Or think we to honour the child with di&s;|&s;olutene&s;s, who came to the world on de|&s;igns of <HI>holine&s;s.</HI> This it is, no doubt, that gives many men a prejudice again&s;t the fe&s;|tival it &s;elf, and perhaps is their mo&s;t &s;peci|ous Argument. We know an an&s;wer, but you may and ought to afford another, by removing any ground for &s;uch a pretence; indeed a forenoon's &s;ermon will never com|pen&s;ate an afternoon's debauch; nor will your &s;ervice in the church ju&s;tify your in|temperance at home. But as hereby at lea&s;t &s;ome time is redeem'd from the too fre|quent cour&s;es of the day, &s;o I wi&s;h the time we &s;pend here, may have &s;ome influence towards the right improvement of the re&s;t; that our behaviour on this &s;olemnity may be &s;uch, as &s;uits with the infinite holine&s;s of the per&s;on whom we profe&s;s to honour, <HI>that we may &s;erve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</HI></P>
