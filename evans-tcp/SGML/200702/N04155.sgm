<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> when he came down from the mo&s;t excel|lent Glory, to bring Life and Immortality to Light in a dark and mi&s;erable World, was plea&s;ed to in&s;truct Mankind in the important Things of Salvation by plain, and mo&s;t affecting <HI>Parables.</HI> Our <HI>Lord</HI> mo&s;t commonly taught the People in <HI>Para|bles</HI> (it being a u&s;ual Method of In&s;truction in the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Countries) and he rarely taught the People without a Parable.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mark</HI> 4.34.</NOTE></P>

unhappy one on the <HI>carele&s;s Multitude,</HI> as it is intima|ted to us in <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.10-11.</P>
<P>The <HI>Parable,</HI> in which our <HI>Text</HI> is contained, is a &s;hort, and very wonderful Repre&s;entation of the great Affair of our Salvation. We are taught what va&s;t Preparation God has made for the Recovery, and Happine&s;s of a &s;inful, peri&s;hing World, intimated in the 16 Ver. by <HI>a certain Man making a great Supper: Matthew</HI> tells us, that <HI>a certain King made a Marriage for his Son,</HI> in his 22 Chapt. By which we are to un|der&s;tand, <HI>GOD</HI> him&s;elf, the <HI>great King</HI> of Heaven, and Earth, who has made a great Supper, and a Fea&s;t of fat Things, in the Go&s;pel, for hungry and peri&s;hing Sinners. And when <HI>all Things were made ready</HI>; when a Saviour was provided; then many, even the whole <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation were invited to come to this Go&s;pel-Fea&s;t. The <HI>Servants</HI> of the Mo&s;t High <HI>GOD,</HI> the <HI>Prophets,</HI> were &s;ent forth to intreat them to accept of the rich Provi&s;ion <HI>God</HI> had made: but <HI>they all excu&s;ed them&s;elves</HI> (or the greater Part of them); one had bought a Piece of Ground and he mu&s;t needs go and &s;ee it; another had bought five Yoke of Oxen; and he mu&s;t go and prove them; a third had married a Wife and he could not come. Hereby not only is the Tem|per and Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Jews</HI> pointed out to us; but al&s;o of the <HI>greater Part</HI> of Men under the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI>; who have their Hearts and Affections &s;o much engag|ed in the Cares of the World, that they cannot con&s;ult the Intere&s;t of their immortal Souls.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Jews</HI> had thus &s;lighted the Invitations of a merciful <HI>God,</HI> and rejected the <HI>Saviour</HI> of their Souls: Then the Offers of Pardon and Reconciliati|on are tendered to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Chri&s;t then &s;ends forth his Servants, the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel into the <HI>Streets and Lanes of the City</HI>; that is, the <HI>Gentile World,</HI> to bring in hither the Poor, the

Maimed, the Halt, and the Blind: And the <HI>Lord</HI> of the Supper repeats his Command to his Servants with the greate&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s; <HI>go out into the High Ways, and Hedges, and compel them to come in:</HI> Take no Denial of them; don't be ea&s;ily put off by them: per&s;wade; yea bring them contrary to their Wills if po&s;&s;ible; and I will make them willing: Gather in great Numbers that <HI>my Hou&s;e may be full</HI>:</P>
<P>We have three Things intimated in the Words of the <HI>Text.</HI> 1&s;t The <HI>Kingdom</HI> or <HI>Church of God</HI> pointed out by the Term <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> which &s;ignifies to us the hap|py State and Condition of all &s;uch, who are brought into the Kingdom of Chri&s;t: They are like Men in a Hou&s;e protected from the Storms and Tempe&s;ts: They may re&s;t and refre&s;h them&s;elves: they may take their Plea&s;ure, fea&s;t and regale them&s;elves in this Hou&s;e. The Kingdom of God is compared to <HI>a great Hou&s;e</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2.20.</NOTE> where there are <HI>Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> &s;ome for <HI>Honour</HI> and &s;ome to <HI>Di&s;honour.</HI> 2dly, We have the <HI>mi&s;erable State of the Gentile World</HI>; and of <HI>all tho&s;e</HI> who are out of the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;et forth to us by tho&s;e who are in the High Ways and Hedges, who are Poor, Maimed, Halt and Blind. They are like Men expo&s;ed to the Storms and Severities of the Weather, who have no Hou&s;e nor Home to repair to, who are ready to peri&s;h with the Hunger and Cold; and are &s;o lame and maimed that they cannot help them&s;elves nor go any where to &s;ave their Lives: Sinners are poor, maimed and helple&s;s, expos'd to all the Storms of the Di&s;plea&s;ure and Wrath of God. 3dly, We have the <HI>Pity and Compa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">n of Chri&s;t</HI> towards &s;uch mi|&s;erable Creatures, and his Earne&s;tne&s;s for their Salva|tion. <HI>Go,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>to his Servants, and compel them to come into my Hou&s;e,</HI> where they may be healed of their Wounds and made rich.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005119_0006_1016AA1289816D08" MS="y">But it is my De&s;ign to con&s;ider the Words before us under the&s;e two general Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The <HI>Salvation</HI> of a <HI>&s;inful</HI> and <HI>mi&s;erable World,</HI> is a Matter, which our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is much en|gaged about.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould al&s;o have the <HI>Salvation</HI> of <HI>Sinners much upon their Hearts:</HI> And &s;hould u&s;e all <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> Methods to <HI>compel</HI> them into the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The <HI>Salvation</HI> of a <HI>&s;inful and mi&s;erable World</HI> is a Matter which our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is much enga|ged about.</HI></P>
<P>So he is repre&s;ented in the <HI>Parable,</HI> as willing to take no Denial; <HI>Compel him to come in</HI>; dont be turn'd off by their Refu&s;als; but intreat, and per&s;wade them over and over again. The Salvation of Sinners was a Work, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had his Mind upon from all Eternity: and he took great Delight in the Fore-thoughts of it: <HI>His Delights were with the Children of Men</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8.31.</NOTE> above what they were with the holy Angels of Heaven; but this could be upon no other Account but that of his being their <HI>appointed Saviour</HI> and <HI>Redeemer</HI>: He fore&s;aw all he was to do, and &s;uffer for them to bring them to <HI>God</HI> with Plea&s;ure. And the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> per&s;o|nating our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, &s;ays <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">P&s;a. 69.6.</NOTE> The <HI>Zeal of thine Hou&s;e hath eaten me up.</HI> He was &s;wallowed up with a Concern for the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> or <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> So much was the Mind of Chri&s;t in this Work, that he was <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Luk. 12.10.</NOTE> <HI>&s;traitned until it was accompli&s;hed</HI>: Nothing could di&s;|courage him from his Work. He would hearken to no Sugge&s;tions of going back from the Sufferings which were before him. And when the <HI>Apo&s;tle Peter</HI> once ventured to tell him, when &s;peaking of his approach|ing Sufferings, that &s;uch Things &s;hould not happen to

him, how &s;harply does he reprove him? <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">Mat. 16.23.</NOTE> <HI>Get thee behind me Satan thou art an Offence unto me.</HI> I will hear no &s;uch Thing from thee; for I am &s;et upon fini&s;hing the Work I am come into the World upon. His Heart was &s;o much &s;et upon it that he could deny him&s;elf of his Ea&s;e and Comfort that he might fulfil it: he could fa&s;t and pray whole Nights for Sinners, who had no Prayers to put up to God for them&s;elves. He was &s;o intent upon his Work, that he forgot his Food: or rather he made it <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">John 4.33, 34.</NOTE> his <HI>Meat and Drink to do the Will of his heavenly Father,</HI> in &s;aving Sinners. He lived, as it were, upon his Work, he took &s;o much Delight in it, and was &s;o much concerned to fini&s;h it. But the Engagedne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in this important Af|fair of our Salvation will more fully appear from the Con&s;ideration of the&s;e following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> mo&s;t <HI>freely,</HI> and <HI>readily un|dertook for Sinners</HI>; became obliged to pay the <HI>Price</HI> of their Redemption, and recover them from a State of <HI>Sin</HI> to <HI>God.</HI> When <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Father</HI> propo&s;ed the Recovery of a Number of the <HI>fallen</HI> Race of <HI>Adam</HI>; and made known the De&s;ign he had of a rich Di&s;play of his Grace in their Salvation; and declared, that in Order to this, &s;ome one mu&s;t become a <HI>Surety</HI> for them, and pay the <HI>full Price</HI> of their Redemption: Then it was there was Silence among the <HI>Angels</HI>: no one dar'd to &s;tep in between an <HI>offended God</HI> and <HI>&s;in|ful Man:</HI> Nor was any Man found, who could un|dertake this great Work: But now, behold the Wil|lingne&s;s and Readine&s;s of the <HI>Son</HI>! how freely does he offer him&s;elf on our Behalf! and &s;ay to the <HI>Fa|ther,</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10.6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>Lo! I am come to do thy Will.</HI> Here, <HI>I,</HI> thy <HI>only begotten Son,</HI> am; place all their Debt to my Ac|count: I will pay thee all: Turn all the Strokes of
<PB N="10" REF="005119_0008_1016AA1968A83FB8">
thy Di&s;plea&s;ure upon me: I will bear them. Don't pity nor &s;pare me; but &s;hoot thine Arrows at me; Cau&s;e thy Sword to awake again&s;t me. I will obey the Law they have broke. I will endure all that Pun|i&s;hment thine holy Law threatens for their Sins. I will &s;atisfy thy Law; and re&s;tore that Honour to thee which their Sins have took away. Now, if it were a Matter of Indifference with the <HI>Son of God,</HI> whether we were &s;aved or not, would he &s;o readily have &s;tept in, and become obliged to pay the whole Price of our Redemption? Would he have bound him&s;elf in a Covenant of Redemption to endure all that Puni&s;h|ment due to Sinners; if he was not much engaged for our Redemption? He was under no Obligation to us. He might have left us to peri&s;h in our Sins with|out the lea&s;t Inju&s;tice to us. Nor did he &s;tand in any Need of us; or the Services which he expects from us, whom he has redeemed; for he was infinitely hap|py in the <HI>Bo&s;om of his Father</HI> and could not be made more &s;o. Nor did the <HI>Father compel</HI> him hereto: It was his own <HI>voluntary</HI> Act: No &s;ooner did the <HI>Father</HI> make known his Purpo&s;es of Grace but the <HI>Son</HI> freely offered him&s;elf to &s;tand our <HI>Surety</HI>; and become obli|ged to pay the Debt we had contracted.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, The <HI>Incarnation</HI> of the <HI>Son of God</HI> &s;hews us, <HI>how much the Work of our Redemption</HI> was upon the <HI>Heart</HI> of the <HI>Son of God.</HI> It was an infinite Conde&s;cen|tion in the <HI>Son of God,</HI> who was equal with <HI>God</HI> in all his divine Perfections, to take upon him the <HI>Seed of Abraham</HI>; and be made <HI>like unto &s;inful Fle&s;h.</HI> The <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God</HI> had a full View of all the Mi&s;eries which &s;hould befal him in <HI>our Nature,</HI> when he came down, and a&s;|&s;umed <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI>; but yet, the&s;e did not terrify him: When the Fulne&s;s of Time was come, that he &s;hould come forth into the World, he readily le&s;t his <HI>Father's Bo&s;om,</HI> parted with the Joys and Glo|ries
<PB N="11" REF="005119_0009_1016AA1B2C0735B0">
of that happy World above; he became Man, and veiled his Glory in <HI>Fle&s;h</HI>: and with what agree|able Wonder and Surprize, &s;hould we contemplate this <HI>great My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, God manife&s;ted in the Fle&s;h?</HI> It is with Plea&s;ure the holy Angels de&s;ire to look in|to and under&s;tand this wonderful Tran&s;action. And had not the Salvation of Sinners been a Thing of the greate&s;t Concern with the <HI>Son of God,</HI> would he have become Man? been made under the Law, and be|come expos'd to the Reproaches, and Bla&s;phemies of a &s;inful World? would he have &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the Condemnation and Threatning of a broken Law; and by being made Man become nece&s;&s;itated to &s;uffer and die in our Stead? As the <HI>Son of God</HI> fore&s;aw all the&s;e Things when he became <HI>Man</HI>&punc; So nothing but infinite Love and Pity to us could move him to it.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The <HI>Laboriou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in <HI>fulfilling</HI> his <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> whil&s;t here on Earth, di&s;cover to us, how <HI>much engag'd</HI> he was to <HI>redeem lo&s;t</HI> and <HI>peri&s;h|ing Sinners.</HI> He was ince&s;&s;ant in his Labours, unwea|ried in his Pains to do good to the <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Bodies</HI> of Men. He went about from City to City, &s;eeking all Opportunities of relieving mi&s;erable Men. He bore the Griefs and carried the Sorrows of the Chil|dren of Men. He never turned a&s;ide from any mi|&s;erable Objects who &s;ought his Compa&s;&s;ion, refu&s;ing to help them. How indu&s;trious was he to reveal the great Purpo&s;es of divine Grace to Sinners, and the Way and Manner of our recovering the lo&s;t Image, and Favour of God: he took the utmo&s;t Plea&s;ure in acquainting Men with the Mi&s;eries of their natural State, in convincing them of the Nece&s;&s;ity they were under of obtaining Pardon and Reconciliation with an offended <HI>God.</HI> He did not &s;pend his Time in Sloth|fulne&s;s; but was careful to fini&s;h the Work he came
<PB N="12" REF="005119_0010_1016AA1E00F24B58" MS="y">
to do (k) before the Night come upon him wherein no Man can work. He was willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent in his Work&punc; He did not &s;pare him&s;elf; but encountered all Hard&s;hips and Difficulties; when they &s;tood in the Way of our Salvation: and what was it &s;tirred him up to all this Labour and Diligence but a <HI>Concern</HI> to fini&s;h the Work of our Redemption? this made him &s;o zealous in all the Matters of God's Hou&s;e. This it was made him deny him&s;elf of his Sleep, and forget his Food.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, That <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>deep Concern</HI> which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had for <HI>hardened</HI> and <HI>&s;ecure Sinners &s;hews how much their Sal|vation lay upon his Mind.</HI></P>
<P>However &s;tupid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Sinners were them|&s;elves; yet <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had a mo&s;t tender Pity for them; however unconcerned they were about their own Cir|cum&s;tances; yet <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was full of Thoughtfulne&s;s about them. When they rejected his gracious Invitations, and &s;leighted his meane&s;t Offers; Then <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">Mark 3.5.</NOTE> he was grieved at the Hardne&s;s and Impenitency of their Hearts. <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">Luke 19.41, 42.</NOTE> He <HI>wept</HI> over a &s;inful wretched World, who were neglecting the Things of their Peace. Our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Saviour</HI> knew what Mi&s;eries, and Torments Sinners were ha&s;tening upon them&s;elves; it fill'd him therefore with Pity to &s;ee them refu&s;ing the only Re|medy for their Souls, and going on ob&s;tinately in the broad Way to everla&s;ting Ruin, and this made the Son of God &s;o affected for them, his being &s;o much concerned for their Salvation.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> &s;o readily undertaking all <HI>tho&s;e &s;evere Sufferings</HI> which he endured for Sinners, &s;hows us <HI>how much his Heart is upon this Work.</HI></P>
<P>Sorrows were multiplied upon the <HI>Son of God.</HI> His whole Life was a Scene of Suffering and Sorrow.
<PB N="13" REF="005119_0011_1016AA20C25F9310">
Hence he is &s;tiled <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah 53.3.</NOTE> <HI>A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief.</HI> He was filled with inward Grief for our Sins and Follies: and he &s;u&s;tained outward Troubles of various Kinds. He became a Reproach of Men, and the Song of Drunkards: he had not where to lay his Head; although the Earth and the Fulne&s;s there|of was his. But why do I tell of the&s;e; they were light compared with what he met with in the <HI>Garden</HI> and at his <HI>Death.</HI> The very Fore-thought of his Suf|ferings was &s;o great that he <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot">Luke 22.44.</NOTE> <HI>&s;weat great Drops of Blood</HI>: The very Ve&s;&s;els of his Body bur&s;t under the pre&s;&s;ing Agony: how great was the Di&s;tre&s;s of his Mind which had &s;o great Power on his Body?

<P>He never murmured, nor complained under all his Sufferings; for they were what he was &s;o much en|gaged to fulfil: but would Chri&s;t have endured &s;o many bitter Things from the Hands of Sinners; if their Salvation was what he was not much concern|ed about?</P>

They are &s;et as <HI>Watchmen</HI> over <HI>God's</HI> People, and they are com|manded to warn them to repent of their Sins, they are <HI>Shepherds,</HI> and they mu&s;t pluck the <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Lambs</HI> out of the Mouth of the Lion and the Bear. <HI>God</HI> has very fully charged his Mini&s;ters to lay them&s;elves out, and improve all their Talents this Way; that <HI>I&s;rael may be gathered.</HI> And it is open Contempt of the di|vine Authority for them to neglect their great Bu&s;i|ne&s;s and &s;uffer Sinners to peri&s;h: if we have any Re|gard to the divine Authority and would not be found di&s;obedient to the great <HI>God,</HI> we mu&s;t apply our|&s;elves to our Work with the greate&s;t Diligence and Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Servants of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> have the <HI>Exam|ple of their Lord</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> to excite them to the greate&s;t Diligence and Carefulne&s;s in their Mini&s;try. Never was &s;uch Indu&s;try, Laboriou&s;ne&s;s, and Concern manife&s;ted in any Affair as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> di&s;covered in this
<PB N="25" REF="005119_0023_1016AA4049C32928">
great Affair of Man's Redemption. He was careful to fini&s;h his Work, to glorify his Father and &s;ave mi|&s;erable Men. <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Luke 10.21.</NOTE> He mourned and grieved when his Labours were not &s;ucceeded. And he rejoiced in Spirit when he had Succe&s;s. He denied him&s;elf all the Comforts of Life, that he might redeem Men from the Slavery of Sin and Satan. He could &s;pend whole Nights weeping and praying over Sinners. And &s;hall his Mini&s;ters think of the Labour, and Di|ligence of their <HI>Lord</HI> in his Work; Of his deep Con|cern for Sinners; And yet be &s;lothful in their Mini&s;try, and unconcerned about tho&s;e immortal Souls that are committed to their Charge? Had we a Sen&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Engagedne&s;s for the Salvation of Sinners, how would it quicken us to the greate&s;t Di|ligence?</P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>infinite Worth of the Souls of Sinners</HI> is a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for Mini&s;ters to be much con|cerned about them. One Soul is of more Worth than the whole World.<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Matth. 16.26.</NOTE> The Souls of Sinners are immortal: and if they are not brought home to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> they mu&s;t be for ever mi&s;erable beyond all Concepti|on. There is a va&s;t Eternity before us, whither all Men are daily ha&s;tning; and as there is a Heaven of Joy for pious and holy Souls; &s;o there is a Hell of Mi&s;ery for all the Ungodly; and this &s;hort Life is the only Opportunity Men have to &s;ecure the one, and e&s;cape the other: <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 11.3.</NOTE> As they are at Death &s;o they will be to all Eternity: <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">Rev. 22.11.</NOTE> he that is filthy at Death will remain &s;o. If Men die in their Sins they mu&s;t peri&s;h in them: There is no Hope for them; for God will take no more Pains with them, and make no more Offers to them. And when Mini&s;ters think of
<PB N="26" REF="005119_0024_1016AA46E5C265A8">
this, that they have immortal Souls to &s;ave which are of more Value than Millions of Worlds, is it not e|nough to &s;pirit them to the utmo&s;t Pains that they may bring them into the Kingdom of God? Can they willingly &s;uffer &s;uch precious Things to be lo&s;t? Will they not pray and weep over them Night and Day as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did, that they may not finally peri&s;h? We are unwilling a Hou&s;e &s;hould be con&s;umed with Fire, and can we be willing an immortal Soul &s;hould burn in the Flames of God's Wrath?</P>
<P>Fourthly, When Mini&s;ters con&s;ider, that <HI>they mu&s;t an&s;wer for all the Souls which peri&s;h through their Neglect,</HI> is it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be indifferent whether Sin|ners are &s;aved or not? The Souls of Men are &s;ome of tho&s;e precious Talents which are committed to Mini&s;ters. And their Lord will demand them of them another Day: When he &s;hall come to judge every Man, and give him according to his Works, then he will demand of his Mini&s;ters, what are become of the Souls committed to their Charge. Then he will ask this and that Servant of his, where is this and that Soul which was committed to thy Charge. And what Plea can tho&s;e Servants make who have not been faithful to their Tru&s;t? If Mini&s;ters have not taught Men their Duty; if they have not war|ned them again&s;t Sin; nor urged them to make &s;ure of eternal Life; <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 3.18.</NOTE> if they peri&s;h, their Blood will be required of them. But how awful is this Con&s;idera|tion, that Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give an Account of the Souls of their People? Is not this eno' to fill Mi|ni&s;ters with the deepe&s;t Concern, that none may pe|ri&s;h through their Neglect? Is not this enough to quicken Mini&s;ters to teach with all Diligence, to ex|hort with Earne&s;tne&s;s, and pray without Cea&s;ing?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="005119_0025_1016AA48A1490EA0">La&s;tly, When we con&s;ider the <HI>great and abundant Promi&s;es, Chri&s;t has made to all his faithful Mini&s;ters,</HI> who are indu&s;trious to per&s;uade Souls into his King|dom, we &s;ee what &s;ufficient Rea&s;on they have to be concerned to &s;ave Sinners. Every Soul, they are the happy In&s;truments of &s;aving, will be an Addition to their Joy, and a bright Gem in their Crown. <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Dan. 12.3.</NOTE> The more Souls are gathered to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> under their Mi|ni&s;try, the greater their Happine&s;s will be.</P>
<P>Could we obtain an earthly Crown by li&s;ting many Soldiers to &s;ome earthly King, would it not enliven us to compel Men into his Service? And &s;hall we not be as much concerned to fill up the Kingdom of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;ince he will be&s;tow on us not earthly Crowns, which &s;hall fade away; but unfadea|ble Crowns of Light and Glory? He who does mo&s;t for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and immortal Souls will have a di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Reward in that heavenly World. And are not the&s;e Things enough to fill the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;|pel with the greate&s;t Concern that they may fill up the <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> and Church of <HI>God</HI>? That Sinners may not be left to peri&s;h in the High Ways and Hedges, whil&s;t there is room enough in the Kingdom of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>The APPLICATION of the whole may be in the following U&s;es.</P>
<P>USE I. Of <HI>Information,</HI> and from what you have heard you may learn the&s;e following Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Salvation of Sinners is a Matter of the <HI>greate&s;t Importance,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them.</HI> The Son of God never would take &s;uch va&s;t Pains therefor, and be &s;o much concerned about it, if it were a Trifle, and a Thing of Indifferency, whether they
<PB N="28" REF="005119_0026_1016AA4E4E309568">
are &s;aved or peri&s;h. Would the Son of God ever have come down from Heaven, veiled his Glory in Fle&s;h? Would he voluntarily have &s;ubjected him|&s;elf to the Law and become obliged to obey it, who him&s;elf was the Author and Giver of it to Mankind? Would he &s;o freely entered upon a Life of Labour, Pain and Sufferings among&s;t Men? Would the eternal <HI>Son of God,</HI> who was the <HI>Brightne&s;s of his Father's Glory,</HI> &s;o readi|ly have &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the Cur&s;es and Reproa|ches of Men, if he is not engaged in this great and important Work of our Salvation? It was attended with the greate&s;t Difficulties; and the mo&s;t bitter Sufferings mu&s;t be endured before ever it could be compleated; all which the <HI>Son of God</HI> had a full View of, when he undertook it: and who can ima|gine that &s;o great a Per&s;onage as the <HI>Son of God</HI> &s;hould have his Mind from all Eternity upon this Work: That &s;o wi&s;e Coun&s;el &s;hould be held about it; that &s;uch va&s;t Preparations &s;hould be made for it; that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould take &s;uch infinite Pains to ac|compli&s;h it, and &s;uffer more than is po&s;&s;ible to con|ceive of, if it were a Trifle and a Thing of no great Concern? No verily the <HI>Son of God</HI> would never have born Reproach: He never would have fa&s;ted and cha&s;ti&s;ed his Soul; he never would have been grieved at the Hardne&s;s of Men's Hearts, nor would he have wept over &s;ecure Sinners, had he not &s;een their Salvation to be a Thing of the la&s;t Importance.&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. From what you have heard, you may &s;ee what <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Gratitude</HI> we owe the <HI>Son of God:</HI> That he &s;hould be &s;o much concerned, and do &s;o much for our Redemption. A Pity and Concern for others, and a Readine&s;s to help, and relieve, naturally commend Love and E&s;teem in other Ca&s;es; A poor Man loves the rich, when he &s;ees him condoling his Poverty,
<PB N="29" REF="005119_0027_1016AA4FD7FB8E90">
and ready to feed and clothe him: a &s;ick Man loves the Phy&s;itian, who has Compa&s;&s;ion on him under his Pains and Di&s;ea&s;es, who is ready to admini&s;ter for his healing: So whatever our Calamities be, our Love and E&s;teem is drawn out to &s;uch as have Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion for us, be it &s;o they only &s;peak comfor|table Words to us; how much more when they re|lieve us? But how much more is <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to be loved by us, who is concerned for us in Things of infinite Moment? who has pitied our mi&s;erable Souls under their &s;piritual Poverty, and dreadful Di&s;ea&s;es; Who has purcha&s;ed at the deare&s;t Rate for us all we want to remedy our mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances; Who offers us the Food of eternal Life, and Streams of living Water that we may never hunger and thir&s;t more; Who tenders the &s;potle&s;s Robes of his own Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s to cover our Nakedne&s;s; who tenders Gold tried in the Fire that we may be rich, who will heal all our Plagues and Infirmities and rai&s;e us to the highe&s;t Dignities and Honours, even to be Kings and Prie&s;ts to the Mo&s;t High <HI>God</HI>; who is concerned for us that we &s;hould not de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e Offers of Mer|cy; earne&s;tly knocks at the Doors of our Hearts until his Locks are wet with the Dews of Night: And be&s;eeches us to hearken to him; that we don't peri&s;h. Shall <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> do &s;o much for us and we have no Pity for our &s;elves, and no Love to him for it? This is bruti&s;h and mo&s;t horrid Ingratitude indeed!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If the <HI>Son of God</HI> is &s;o much concerned a|bout our Salvation does it lie &s;o much upon his Mind, then certainly we ought to be concerned a|bout it our &s;elves. Shall he fa&s;t for us, and we live in the Gratifications of the Fle&s;h our&s;elves? Shall he pray till his Soul is &s;pent and melted within him, and we re&s;train Prayer before <HI>God</HI>? Shall he weep and mourn over us, and we have no Tears to &s;hed for
<PB N="30" REF="005119_0028_1016AA52992C9868">
our &s;elves? Shall he agonize and &s;weat great Drops of Blood for us, and we not wre&s;tle and &s;trive to o|vercome the Enemies of our Souls? Can this be and yet we have any Sen&s;e of our State and the dreadful Mi&s;ery ha&s;tening upon us? Let us all be up, and about our Bu&s;ine&s;s, as <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath &s;et us an Example: Let us all endeavour to awaken in our own Minds the mo&s;t lively Concern for our eternal Well-Being by &s;erious Meditation and fervent Prayer to <HI>God</HI> to realize &s;piritual Things to our Souls. Let us often reflect upon <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Labour, his Prayers and his Tears for us. Let us often wonder and admire that he &s;hould have &s;uch Concern for us; and we be no more concerned for our own precious immortal Souls, which mu&s;t be happy or mi&s;erable, according to the Provi&s;ion we make for them in this &s;hort Life to all Eternity. We can't be too much concerned for them; We can't do too much for their Well-Being, the lit|tle while we have to live here.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Has <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the Salvation of Sinners &s;o much upon his Mind, then you &s;ee what Encourage|ment Sinners have to &s;eek Salvation by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>: He will a&s;&s;uredly <NOTE N="(y)" PLACE="foot">Heb. 7.25.</NOTE> &s;ave all that come to the <HI>Father</HI> in and by him, <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">John 6.37.</NOTE> nor will he ca&s;t out any that come to him for Life. He &s;tands with open Arms to receive repenting Sinners: He holds out a Scepter of Grace to them that they may come to God, with Boldne&s;s in this Way of Acce&s;s by the <HI>Blood of Chri&s;t.</HI> The <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> will reject none; but a&s;&s;ures us that all &s;hall be welcome. Who&s;oever will let <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rev. 22.17.</NOTE> him come, is the Language of the <HI>Son of God</HI> to Sinners. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> cannot deny him&s;elf: he will fulfil all his Pro|mi&s;es to &s;uch as depend upon him for Salvation. He is not only able to &s;ave Sinners, but he is willing to
<PB N="31" REF="005119_0029_1016AA54553BAB40">
undertake for them and re&s;cue them from the Jaws of De&s;truction: his Heart is &s;et upon this Work, he needs no large Intreaties to grant Salvation to you: are you but willing to be &s;aved by him and give divine Grace the Glory, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is ready: There is not the lea&s;t Backwardne&s;s on his Part: his Delights are with the Children of Men: He has paid the Price of your Redemption: he has &s;atisfied the Law, and appea&s;ed the incen&s;ed Wrath of <HI>God,</HI> he has &s;uffered the whole Penalty due for Sin: he has &s;hed his Blood to clean&s;e your Souls and wa&s;h out the Stains of Sin: and is it po&s;&s;ible after all this that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould deceive and di&s;|appoint you, and turn you off with Coldne&s;s when you come to him? No verily, Heaven and Earth may pa&s;s away but not the lea&s;t Jot of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Promi|&s;es fail: If <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;o much engaged in this Work; Here is all the Encouragement you want. What can you ask for more? He is able to &s;ave you; he has all you want, and he is perfectly willing. Let none therefore ever excu&s;e them&s;elves in their Sloth and Negligence in &s;eeking Salvation under any Pretence they have not Encouragement enough. But let all young and old look to the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> for Pardon and Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> If this is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mini&s;ters to com|pel Souls into the Kingdom of <HI>God,</HI> and if it is thus required of them to improve their utmo&s;t Endeavours to bring Souls to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> then they may ju&s;tly cry out with the <HI>Apo&s;tle, Who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e Things?</HI> Who is it knows, in all Re&s;pects, how to deal with immortal Souls in the momentous Affairs of Eterni|ty? Who is that <HI>Scribe</HI> in&s;tructed to the Kingdom of Heaven, who can bring out of his Trea&s;ure Things new and old, who can give to every one his Portion in their Sea&s;on? Who is it knows how and when to in&s;i&s;t upon the <HI>Terrors of the Law,</HI> and di&s;cover the
<PB N="32" REF="005119_0030_1016AA5841878E48">
terrible Wrath of God to the Sinner; and point out to him the Mi&s;eries and Agonies of the damned: and then can &s;o intermingle the <HI>Gentle Motives of the Go&s;pel</HI> as to excite the <HI>Hope of the Sinner.</HI> So that, on the one Hand, he may be &s;uitably concerned to &s;ave his Soul, and on the other, may not be hurried on to de&s;pair of Mercy? How few can &s;o &s;peak to Sinners as to awaken them, and &s;o hold out the rich Invitations of Mercy, that the weary and Sin-burthen Sinner may accept of them? How much Need do Mini&s;ters &s;tand in of the Grace of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and the Aids of his <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> in this great Work? They have no Strength nor Wi&s;dom of their own, they never would bring one Soul into the Kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> did not the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> work with them and give Succe&s;s to their Labours. It is he &s;ubdues the People under him&s;elf and makes them willing in the Day of his Power.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> If Mini&s;ters are &s;ent forth to per&s;wade Men into the Kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> then it is the <HI>In|tere&s;t of a People to be in&s;tant in Prayer to God for them.</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. 3.1.</NOTE> <HI>Pray for us,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> that the <HI>Word of God may have free Cour&s;e</HI>: If Mi|ni&s;ters are never &s;o faithful and laborious, if they &s;pend and be &s;pent for your Souls, it will avail no|thing to your Salvation, if <HI>God</HI> work not within you both to will and to do of his good Plea&s;ure. The Conver&s;ion of your Souls is the Work of God. And can you expect he will ever make you the happy Subjects of it, if you pray not for it? Be found often therefore upon your Knees, wre&s;tling with God for your Mini&s;ters, that <HI>God</HI> would make them Sons of Thunder to <HI>&s;ecure Sinners,</HI> and <HI>Sons of Con&s;o|lation</HI> to his <HI>own Children.</HI> Mini&s;ters are commonly
<PB N="33" REF="005119_0031_1016AA5B0844F568">
&s;uch as a People pray them to be; and their <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> is u&s;ually in Proportion to their <HI>earne&s;t Prayers</HI> for their Mini&s;ters. If you neglect to pray for them God has &s;et over you, there is too much Rea&s;on to fear, they will only prove a Savour of Death unto Death to your Souls.</P>
<P>USE II. of <HI>Awakening to Sinners.</HI> And is it &s;o that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has taken va&s;t Pains for your Salvation? Is he &s;till waiting upon you and pleading with you, in his Word, and by his Mini&s;ters? And are his Mini&s;ters endeavouring to per&s;wade and compel you into the Kingdom of Chri&s;t? Then think upon the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, How <HI>inexcu&s;eable</HI> you will be found in the <HI>great Day of Accounts.</HI></P>
<P>You will have no Plea to make for your &s;elves, your own Mouths will condemn you, your own Con|&s;ciences will te&s;tify what Pains have been taken with you: how earne&s;tly the <HI>Son of God</HI> has intreated you: How his Mini&s;ters have urged you. Then <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will tell you how you &s;topped your Ears again&s;t his Calls, and mocked at all his Reproofs: Then <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will put you in Mind of all the precious Oppor|tunities you have had and how much you have a|bu&s;ed them: Then he will tell you how he laid hold on you by his Mini&s;ters, and the Convictions of his <HI>Spirit</HI> and would have plucked you out of the Fire of Sin and Hell; but you offered Violence to his Ser|vants, and de&s;pite to the <HI>Spirit</HI> of his Grace, &amp; choo&s;e rather to peri&s;h in your Sins, than accept of Life by him: And what can the Sinner &s;ay when his Judge thus convicts him? What Shame and Confu&s;ion will cover the Face of every Sinner in that Day? Their own Hearts will condemn them and their <HI>Judge</HI> is greater than they. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the
<PB N="34" REF="005119_0032_1016AA5DC5B3F218">
Horror and the Confu&s;ion that Sinners who peri&s;h un|der the Light of the Go&s;pel will be in at that Day: They would gladly have the Mountains and Rocks fall on them to cover them from the Face of their <HI>Judge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Let the Sinner &s;eriou&s;ly think, what an <HI>in&s;upportable Puni&s;hment</HI> he is bringing upon him&s;elf by refu&s;ing to enter into the Kingdom of <HI>God</HI>: all the Pains and Intreaties that are u&s;ed with Sinners to com|pel them into the Kingdom of <HI>God,</HI> &s;erve to increa&s;e and aggravate their everla&s;ting Condemnation and Torment. If all the Pains which are taken with you prove ineffectual for your Salvation, it is likely they will greatly inhance your Mi&s;ery. Every &s;lighted Call, and every abu&s;ed Invitation will lay a Founda|tion for the more &s;evere Reflections of Con&s;cience. How in&s;upportable will your Puni&s;hment be if you &s;tand out again&s;t all the Earne&s;tne&s;s of the <HI>Son of God?</HI> It will be more tolerable for the Sinners of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> than for you. Yea, it will be more tolera|ble for tho&s;e impious <HI>Jews,</HI> who with wicked Hands took our <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and put him to Death,</HI> than for you; <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Acts <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.17.</NOTE> for they did it <HI>ignorantly</HI> the Apo&s;tle tells us; but you reject him; who <HI>know he is the Son of God</HI>; they in&s;ulted him in the Form of a Servant; in his State of Humiliation: but you in his State of Glory upon his Throne; and let the Sinner think with him|&s;elf, how he can bear an endle&s;s Eternity reflecting upon the Pity, the Patience, the Long-&s;uffering, and moving Invitations of the <HI>Son of God</HI>: and how he de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected them; How can you bear in Hell to remember what Pains Mini&s;ters have taken with you? how they urged you to &s;ubject your&s;elves to the Government of the <HI>Son of God</HI>; and you would not?</P>
