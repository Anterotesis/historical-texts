<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NO one knows, how far every per&s;on in Britain may be intere&s;ted in the event of the mea&s;ures now carrying on with re&s;pect to our colonies in North|America. This &s;eems to entitle any man on account of his own &s;take therein to &s;peak his &s;entiments on the &s;ubject. The concern of the community gives to them likewi&s;e for their better &s;ecurity a claim, that every opinion may be offered for con&s;ideration. The&s;e things re&s;ult from the nature of a free &s;ociety, and particularly from the con&s;ti|tution of Great-Britain, where the people chu&s;e one part of the legi&s;lative and where every man is &s;uppo&s;ed to have ultimately a &s;hare in the government of his country.</P>
<P>One point in di&s;pute between us and the Americans is the right of taxing them here at home. This may be &s;aid to concern the power of our parliament. But &s;o does every general propo&s;ition of right and wrong. When any thing is affirmed to be unju&s;t, does it not conclude and is it not almo&s;t &s;ynonimous to the &s;aying, that a law made to en|force it would be &s;o too and beyond the proper power of a legi&s;lature? Vengeance and puni&s;hment do in the cour&s;e of things a&s;&s;uredly pur&s;ue &s;tates and nations for their op|pre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice; again&s;t the commi&s;&s;ion of which it is beyond que&s;tion the right of every member of the com|munity to warn the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013582_0004_0F90FC5C68662DA8">
I &s;ay it with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but the power of the parliament is the right of the public. The particular members of that mo&s;t re&s;pectable body are in the &s;tatutes enacted by them no more per&s;onally intere&s;ted, than the re&s;t of their coun|trymen. The&s;e pa&s;s through their hands, but being &s;o pa&s;&s;ed, they are them&s;elves bound to obey them in common with others. They are indeed our tru&s;tees and guardians in that high office, but they will on that account be the more inclined, that every &s;tep taken or to be taken by them &s;hould be fully and carefully examined, like all other hone&s;t men earne&s;t for the intere&s;t of tho&s;e, who&s;e concerns are committed to their care.</P>
<P>A con&s;ideration of the mea&s;ures now propo&s;ed may like|wi&s;e po&s;&s;ibly lead towards &s;ome nice and delicate conjectures or circum&s;tances, whether of the pre&s;ent time or of that to come. But it need not be &s;aid, that the writer only finds the one and gue&s;&s;es at the other; they depend on an author much higher than Princes or their mini&s;ters, but who is plea&s;ed to &s;uffer the actions of the&s;e to have mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial effects in the producing them. What can then be a more fit means to induce a due reflection on our proceed|ings and to in&s;ure from them a de&s;irable &s;ucce&s;s, than to lay before the public or the governors of it &s;ome po&s;&s;ible con&s;equences of their conduct?</P>
<P>We have not far to &s;eek for the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation of things between the mother country and our colo|nies of North-America; of the oppo&s;ition and di&s;turbances on the one hand and of the violent laws, motions and pre|parations on the other. The&s;e all undoubtedly proceed from our having taxed tho&s;e colonies without their con&s;ent. Affection and union obtained between us before there &s;uc|ceeded in&s;tead animo&s;ity and oppo&s;ition, as &s;oon as that was attempted; however peace and &s;atisfaction were on our &s;taying our hands again re&s;tored. We are now once more come back to the charge and the &s;pirit of di&s;cord &s;eems like|wi&s;e returned &s;even times &s;tronger than it was before. Other broils and conte&s;ts may &amp; many no doubt will ari&s;e from this cau&s;e, &s;hould it proceed; but this is the origin, the &s;pring and the &s;ource. The right it&s;elf of this mea&s;ure is in que&s;|tion, as well as the expediency of it: I will therefore pre|pare to &s;ay &s;omething to that propo&s;ition.</P>

The inhabitants of our colonies in North-America are &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of about two millions of per&s;ons; they occupy and po&s;&s;e&s;s a very exten&s;ive territory, much larger than Great-Britain; they are not them&s;elves the original people of the country, but they now &s;tand in their place; they have in general been born and bred there, however they receive likewi&s;e yearly from other places many, who mix them&s;elves with them; they have divided them|&s;elves into &s;everal different governments; they have ac|cording to certain rules or laws agreed upon among them alloted every man his own; they have felled the fore&s;t; they have cleared and tilled the land, they have planted it, they have &s;own it, they have &s;tocked it with cat|tle; they have built them&s;elves hou&s;es; they have entered into exchange and commerce; they have &s;pared and &s;a|ved for a future day or for their families; they have by many and various means acquired many and various &s;orts of property; they are by nature intitled to welfare and happine&s;s and to &s;eek and pur&s;ue tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, by all the methods not attended with fraud or violence towards others, which they &s;hall conceive and believe the mo&s;t probable to procure or en&s;ure them; they have for that end a right to freedom in their governments and to &s;ecurity in their per|&s;ons and properties; none are warranted to deprive or di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s them of the&s;e things; &s;hould on the contrary one man or a body of men advance any claim, which tended to en&s;lave all the per&s;ons or to un&s;ettle all the property of this great community, to dive&s;t them of every thing, which they po&s;&s;e&s;s and to leave them nothing which they could call their own of all, that they have thus inherited, earned or acqui|red; the very enormity, the evil and unnatural con&s;equen|ces of &s;uch a propo&s;ition would of them&s;elves &s;ufficiently &s;hew its ab&s;urdity, weakne&s;s and unrea&s;onablene&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all either primary, e&s;&s;ential, inherent rights of human nature or &s;uch as do with re&s;pect to per&s;ons in the &s;ituation before de&s;cribed nece&s;&s;arily flow and follow from them. Tho&s;e were conferred upon them by the great Au|thor of their being when he was plea&s;ed to endow them with the faculties of men, with the perception of good and evil, with the means of &s;elf pre&s;ervation and &s;elf-defence, with the organs of rea&s;on and of &s;peech and with a capacity to a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves for their mutual protection and &s;up|port.
<PB N="8" REF="013582_0006_0F90FC5DEB395E60">
They are common to all mankind; they &s;ub&s;i&s;t at all times, in all regions and all climates; in Turkey, in Spain, in France, in Old England and in New, in Europe and in America; whenever and wherever a number of men are found to be the objects of them. I don't mean that they are in all the&s;e places always or at this time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and enjoyed as they ought to be. But they are to an&s;wer for that, who do &s;o commonly employ to the en&s;laving and oppre&s;&s;ing of mankind the powers, which the&s;e entru&s;t only for their protection and defence. However this is only abu&s;e, violence and inju&s;tice; the right neverthele&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;ts and remains.</P>
<P>It is not on this &s;ubject nece&s;&s;ary to enter into a long and minute detail of rea&s;oning. The&s;e principles are with us common and publick; they are founded on the good, the welfare and the happine&s;s of mankind. They were the principles of our ance&s;tors, of our grandfathers and of our fathers; they may perhaps not be at pre&s;ent in their full vigour; however, I tru&s;t, that they are not yet &s;o worn out or lo&s;t from among us, but that they &s;till remain the prin|ciples of the nation. They are to de&s;cribe them by a word well known in our language the principles of Whigs; whereby I dont however mean of certain modern Whigs, who &s;eem more fond of the word, than of any thing belong|ing to the character; who have perhaps at one time or other of their lives counteracted all the mea&s;ures and con|tradicted all the principles that ever did an honour to the name; but I mean of Whigs before the Revolution and at the time of it; I mean the principles which &s;uch men as Mr. Locke, Lord Mole&s;worth and Mr. Trenchard main|tained with their pens, Mr. Hampden and Lord John Ru&s;|&s;el with their blood, and Mr. Algernon Sydney with both; names, which mu&s;t &s;urely by all Engli&s;hmen ever be revered, as tho&s;e of &s;ome of the fir&s;t among men. But let me add, that they are not only the principles of &s;peculative &s;tudents in their clo&s;ets or of great but unfortunate men, whom their zeal and virtue have led to martyrdom for the liberties of their country and the welfare of mankind; but that they are likewi&s;e the real principles of our pre&s;ent actual Go|vernment, the principles of the Revolution and tho&s;e on which are e&s;tabli&s;hed the throne of the King and the &s;ettle|ment of the illu&s;trious Family now reigning over us</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013582_0007_0F90FC5EB0BAB370">
On the &s;ame principles re&s;t both in general many rights of the Americans and in particular the right now before us. The&s;e are hereby involved and interwoven with our highe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;acred concerns; we cannot lift up our hands to take them away without forfeiting our national character, without renouncing the tenets and maxims where|on we have on our mo&s;t important and critical occa&s;ions ever acted as a People; and without declaring that we claim a right to re&s;i&s;t and oppo&s;e all tho&s;e, who oppre&s;s us our|&s;elves, and at the &s;ame time to trample upon and tyrannize over all others, where we hope that we have the power to do it with impunity.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, that the&s;e are indeed in them&s;elves very true and commendable opinions; but that they are here introduced on &s;ubjects not worthy of them; a duty of a few &s;hillings upon &s;ome &s;orts of paper or parchment and a few pence upon a pound of Tea. Let us therefore more particularly con&s;ider the nature of the claim and preten&s;ion in que&s;tion. Suppo&s;e then one per&s;on to have in his pocket an hundred pounds, but another to have the right to take it from him and to put it into his own pocket or to do with it what he plea&s;es; to whom does that money belong? This needs no an&s;wer. Suppo&s;e the &s;um to be a thou&s;and or ten thou&s;and pounds? That makes no difference. Sup|po&s;e one per&s;on to have a right to demand of another not only one certain &s;um or what he has about him, but as much as he plea&s;es and as often? This goes to the all of that other. But &s;uppo&s;e not one &s;ingle per&s;on only to be &s;ubject to &s;uch demands from one other, but a number of men, a colony or any other community to be &s;o &s;ubject to the demands of &s;ome other &s;ociety. What then? Why then that will go in like manner to their all. This &s;eems to be &s;o evident, that whoever &s;hall multiply words on the &s;ubject, will hardly do it for the &s;ake of being convinced.</P>
<P>But is this ca&s;e, that of the Americans; for it is &s;aid that the money rai&s;ed on them is to be employed for their own benefit, in their civil &s;ervice or military defence? Let me a&s;k then, Who are in their ca&s;e to determine, whether any money is at all wanted for &s;uch purpo&s;es; they who pay it or they who take it? They who take it. Who are to determine the quantity wanted? They who take it.
<PB N="10" REF="013582_0008_0F90FC5F687A2EC0">
Who are to determine, how often it is wanted? They who take it. Who are to determine, whether it is really laid out in the purpo&s;es pretended? They who take it. Suppo&s;e the Americans &s;hould be of opinion or declare, that the money &s;o rai&s;ed is u&s;ed not for their advantage but the contrary; is that a bar to the rai&s;ing? No. Sup|po&s;e them to complain that the money pretended to be laid out in their civil &s;ervice is given to corrupt their Gover|nors or Judges; is that a bar to the rai&s;ing? No. Sup|po&s;e them to &s;ignify, that the money alledged to be u&s;ed in their military defence is employed in paying troops to en|&s;lave them and which they had rather be without; is that a bar to the rai&s;ing? No. Wherein then does this differ from will and plea&s;ure in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ens&s;e?</P>
<P>This claim affects therefore mo&s;t clearly the all of the Americans. Two millions of people, &s;ubject to no le&s;s than twelve different Governments and inhabiting, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing and being ma&s;ters of a country exceedingly larger than that of tho&s;e, who make the claim or in who&s;e name it is made, have on this ground no property at all, nothing which they can truly call their own, nothing but what may at any time be demanded of them, but what they may be de|prived of without and again&s;t their will and con&s;ent. It cannot therefore &s;urely be a que&s;tion whether or no, this is a matter of &s;uch a magnitude as to de&s;erve the mo&s;t &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. But it might here be without further words left to every man's determination, whether this is on the one hand a rea&s;onable ground, whereon to put into confu|&s;ion all the parts of the Briti&s;h empire, to throw the mother country and her North-American colonies into the mo&s;t deadly feuds and in all appearance a civil war with one another or whether it is not on the other hand a propo&s;ition incon&s;i&s;tent with the e&s;&s;ential laws of nature, &s;ubver&s;ive of the fir&s;t and inherent rights of humanity and contrary to the principles whereon our fore-fathers defended, and under the &s;anction of which they have through &s;o many civil wars and with the di&s;po&s;ition, bani&s;hment and change of &s;o many Princes, deliver'd down to us the rights and properties, which Engli&s;hmen now enjoy.</P>
<P>But it is in this di&s;pute very often repre&s;ented; that a total and ab&s;olute dependence on the Briti&s;h Parliament without any exception what&s;oever either with regard to
<PB N="11" REF="013582_0009_0F90FC60AAB5AB88">
taxes or any other is liberty it&s;elf; it is Briti&s;h liberty, which is the be&s;t of liberty. I an&s;wer, who &s;ays otherwi&s;e in the ca&s;e of us, who chu&s;e that Parliament; but that in &s;ome other ca&s;es, this po&s;ition may perhaps be more liable to que&s;tion. Our North-American colonies are as to their internal con|&s;titution a very free people, as free as the Venetians the Dutch or the Swi&s;s, or perhaps more &s;o than any of them. This proceeds from their A&s;&s;emblies being not only the nominal but the real Repre&s;entatives; of tho&s;e whom they govern. The&s;e are elected fairly, fully and often. In the&s;e A&s;&s;em|blies their liberty con&s;i&s;ts and it is certainly true and genu|ine. But change the &s;cene a little; let any one Colony be taxed and governed not by their own but by the A&s;&s;embly of another; what is then become of their genuine liberty? It is gone and lo&s;t with their own A&s;&s;em|bly. Let all the Colonies be &s;o &s;ubjected to the A&s;&s;embly of &s;ome one among them. That won't mend the matter. Let us take a larger &s;cale. Suppo&s;e this power over them be lodged in the Parliament of ireland. We are never the nearer. Let us come towards home. Were the kingdom of Ireland under the taxation and direction of the Briti&s;h Parliament would they then think them&s;elves to be very free? For an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion enquire of one of that country. Place then the Iri&s;h under one of the A&s;&s;emblies before mentioned. They would be yet further from home and it might not be better with them. Let us take our own turn. Suppo&s;e Great-Britain on the like conditions under the Parliament of Ireland. God forbid. I think that I have but one more point, before that I am at an end of my combination. Place over our heads with all the&s;e powers in their full &s;orce the A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, what then? I fancy that we &s;hould &s;oon change a certain tune and &s;ing another &s;ong, than what we do now. Let me then mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly que&s;tion any man, from who&s;e brea&s;t all candour and ju&s;tice are not totally bani&s;hed, where is as to liberty or property the difference between any of the ca&s;es now &s;uppo&s;ed, and that original one which has given occa|&s;ion to them. I &s;peak this no otherwi&s;e than with the ut|mo&s;t reverence and re&s;pect towards our own legi&s;lature; but are we to conceive or would it be a compliment to them, or does any one mean to &s;ay, that they are not men, or that they are to be excepted and exempted from the rea|&s;ons
<PB N="12" REF="013582_0010_0F90FC6116EC1290">
and the rules, which obtain and take place in the ca&s;e of all the re&s;t of mankind?</P>
<P>One of the long robe may perhaps demand the exact time when the&s;e rights begin in ri&s;ing and growing &s;tates to take place, and how many years, months and days a colony mu&s;t be fir&s;t &s;ettled. I may venture to promi&s;e to re&s;olve &s;uch an one; when he &s;hall tell me in how many years, months and days an oaken plant grows to be an oaken tree, or a boy becomes a man; which &s;eem to be two much ea&s;ier que&s;tions. The boundaries are &s;eldom nicely di&s;tingui&s;ha|ble. where nature proceeds with an even and con&s;tant hand. But it is not difficult to an&s;wer that the event has already taken place, when near two millions of people are in full and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a country as is occupied by our North-American colonies.</P>
<P>It may likewi&s;e be a&s;ked, whether the&s;e laws are appli|cable to all ca&s;es of private property between man and man. But the full re&s;olution of this que&s;tion might demand a Spani&s;h ca&s;ui&s;t, or a book as big as a volume of our &s;tatutes at large. Any man may for me amu&s;e him&s;elf with trying the titles of nations to the territories and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which they fill, enjoy and inhabit, as he would do tho&s;e between man and man about a hou&s;e and garden; and &s;hould the proce&s;s in the fir&s;t ca&s;e la&s;t as long in proportion, as one does in the latter before &s;ome Courts of Ju&s;tice in Europe the defendants need not perhaps de&s;ire a longer or &s;urer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But may not the&s;e principles go far, if carried to the extent? That is indeed a very &s;erious que&s;tion and per|haps well worthy of con&s;ideration. Our colonies are content that we &s;hould at our plea&s;ure regulate their trade provi|ded that what we do is bona fide, really, truly and &s;incerely for that purpo&s;e, and that only; but they deny that we &s;hall tax them. They a&s;&s;ent and agree to the fir&s;t; but they ab&s;olutely refu&s;e the la&s;t. The&s;e two different points do likewi&s;e not &s;tand on the &s;ame foundation; they have to the one &s;ubmitted ever &s;ince their origin; it has been corroborated by their perpetual and con&s;tant con&s;ent and acquie&s;cence; the other is a novelty, again&s;t which they have from its fir&s;t attempt mo&s;t &s;trongly prote&s;ted and acted. Why cannot we therefore content us with the line drawn by them&s;elves and with the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, from
<PB N="13" REF="013582_0011_0F90FC629E36A268">
which we receive &s;uch prodigious benefit and advantage, now ari&s;ing and yearly encrea&s;ing? But may not they in time extend their objections to this al&s;o? The cour&s;e of things and the flux of years will certainly produce very many things more extraordinary than that. All the whole of our colonies mu&s;t no doubt one day without force or vi|olence fall off from from the parent &s;tate, like ripe fruit in the maturity of time. The earth it&s;elf having had a be|ginning, cannot but decay likewi&s;e, pa&s;s away and have an end. But why &s;hould we be over curious about objects per|haps very far remote and di&s;turb our&s;elves about a futurity which does not affect us, and the di&s;tance of which, we don't know? Why &s;hould we &s;hake the fruit unripe from the tree, becau&s;e it will of cour&s;e drop off, when it &s;hall be ripe? Every time has its own circum&s;tances, according to which the events of it mu&s;t be provided for, when they happen. That cannot now be done. New and unrea&s;on|able demands, inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion, violence on our parts, will forward and ha&s;ten the&s;e events even before their time; let us withold our hands from the&s;e things; we have ne|ver yet had rea&s;on to boa&s;t our&s;elves of &s;uch expedients, nor, let me add, ever to repent us of the contrary conduct.</P>
<P>There are no doubt in all governments many mo&s;t im|portant points un&s;ettled and undetermined; &s;uch in par|ticular as relate to the limits between the power of the So|vereign and the obedience of the Subject. This mu&s;t al|ways be the ca&s;e between Kings and their People, principal States and their dependencies, Mother Countries and their Colonies. It is very much the part of every prudent ruler whether the Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of a Prince or any other to avoid with the utmo&s;t care and &s;olicitude all mea&s;ures, which may po&s;&s;ibly bring any &s;uch critical circum&s;tances into public debate and di&s;pute. It is always a bad &s;ign when &s;uch con|te&s;ts ari&s;e; they cannot do &s;o without the di&s;order of the whole, but they are to the Sovereign in particular ever dangerous and often fatal. They may perhaps be compar|ed to gunpowder, than who&s;e grain nothing is more harm|le&s;s, while it is at re&s;t; but let it be put into action and it will make the wilde&s;t ravages all around or overthrow the &s;tronge&s;t bulwarks and fortifications.</P>
<P>To how many of the&s;e que&s;tions did our Charles the Fir&s;t give in his true ri&s;e or occa&s;ion, and how dearly did he abide

it! How many points of this &s;ort are undetermined between Great Britain and Ireland, which are now to our mutual happine&s;s intirely dormant, but which &s;tarted and pur&s;ued with ob&s;tinacy and eagerne&s;s might make one or both of the i&s;lands run with blood. They need perhaps be no further looked for, than certain doctrines formerly advanced by Mr. Molyneux on the one hand and the l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">w of Poinings on the other. But it has plea&s;ed Providence to &s;helter us hitherto from this mi&s;chief. It is not now perhaps many months, &s;ince we did not want an opportunity to have engaged in one &s;uch. The alterations of a late bill from that country were only accidental. But does any one doubt, whether &s;ome forward man might not have been found, who would on occa&s;ion have furni&s;hed rea&s;ons better or wor&s;e to maintain the right of making them. But how much more prudent was our conduct? If peace and harmony are then &s;o beneficial and de&s;irable between Great-Britain and Ire|land and the mea&s;ures producing or in&s;uring them good, upright and wi&s;e; why do the&s;e things &s;o alter their nature, when they are applied to America?</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent accur&s;ed que&s;tion between us and our colo|nies how long was it unknown or unthought of! Who heard of it from the fir&s;t ri&s;e of tho&s;e &s;ettlements, until a very few years ago; that a fatal attempt forced it into notice and importance. But it is now already &s;etting at work fleets and armies; it threatens the confu&s;ion and per|haps the de&s;truction of both countries and but too probably of one of them; although God only knows whether the calamity will fall on that of the two, which many men may now imagine and believe to be the mo&s;t in danger.</P>
<P>This point is not alone; there are other que&s;tions of the &s;ame &s;ort, concerning which no man now di&s;turbs him|&s;elf; but which &s;tirred and &s;tarted by new demands or any other means might in like manner band again&s;t one another Great-Britain and its Colonies. Princes and States never do better, than when their claims are not fathomed nor if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, the bottom of them over curiou&s;ly founded and examined. The terms of municipal laws u&s;u|ally favour the Sovereign, they are often framed or drawn by his creatures and dependents; the law of nature is more commonly in &s;upport of the people and the publick; it is the production of him who &s;ees with an equal eye, Prince

and Subject, High and Low, European and American. God forbid, that two &s;uch parts of the Briti&s;h empire, as the mo|ther-country and her colonies &s;hould in our times divide and contend again&s;t one another on the &s;anction of the&s;e two different laws, which ought in every &s;tate to be con|&s;tantly blended and united and which can never without its utter di&s;order and confu&s;ion be made to &s;trike and to cla&s;h again&s;t each other. Whenever that &s;hall happen, let us be a&s;&s;ured, that we are running upon a rock, whereon we can|not but make &s;hipwreck.</P>
<P>I have hitherto, on the law of nature and the common rights of humanity con&s;idered the claim of the Americans not to be here in England taxed by us again&s;t their own will and con&s;ent. It re&s;ts firmly on that foundation; but I don't mean to &s;ay that it re&s;ts on that only. Could this be removed, there would yet remain another on which it would neverthele&s;s &s;tand &s;ure and un&s;haken; I mean that of the Special Con&s;titution of Great-Britain, which does herein mo&s;t ju&s;tly and wi&s;ely coincide with the general con|&s;titution of humanity and require that the property of no man living under its protection &s;hould without his con&s;ent by him&s;elf or repre&s;entative be taken from him or; accord|ing to the language of the time, that repre&s;entation &s;hould go along with taxation.</P>
<P>But this argument has particularly been in the hands of the fir&s;t men of our times. They have &s;et it in its full light and their authority has recommended it to the attention of their country. It is well known and well under&s;tood and I am per&s;uaded that it is unan&s;werable. But I bear more re&s;pect both to tho&s;e per&s;ons and to the public, than to go over it again &s;o much to its di&s;advantage. I will therefore beg leave only to a&s;&s;ume this rea&s;on and to join it to my for|mer; when the right of the Americans will &s;tand on this double foundation of the general law of nature and of the particular con&s;titution of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>However it has been &s;aid, that the Americans are in our Parliament virtually repre&s;ented. How that &s;hould be when they are not really &s;o, I &s;hall leave to be explained by tho&s;e who advance it. But God forbid, that the condition of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &s;hould ever be &s;uch, as for a whole people of them to be in danger of being &s;tripped of all their proper|ties only by the logick of &s;uch an unmeaning word or di&s;|tinction, as that is.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="013582_0014_0F90FC671BBE0530">
But what are the exact bounds and limits of real repre|&s;entation? I will excu&s;e my&s;elf from entering into that que&s;tion. But will an American &s;cruple to &s;ay; that if in any future time things &s;hould here at home be from their pre&s;ent &s;tate &s;o far changed and the con&s;titution of Great|Britain &s;o lo&s;t, that a great majority of its Repre&s;entatives &s;hall be named by a handful of needy men; that they &s;hall mo&s;t evidently and mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly be both cho&s;en by a corrupt and undue influence and be afterwards guided and governed by the &s;ame; will he not &s;ay, that it may at that di&s;tant day better become &s;uch a mock Repre&s;entative to prove their own right of taxing Britain, than to pretend to tax America?</P>
<P>So much for con&s;ent and repre&s;entation. But there is another ground, whereon the Americans likewi&s;e rely, which is that of their own provincial charters. I &s;hall leave the particulars of this &s;ubject to them&s;elves, who are be&s;t acquainted with them. However I will in general &s;ay, that the&s;e charters are no doubt in aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the two &s;anctions before mentioned very properly brought for the &s;hortening and &s;ilenceing of di&s;putes and debates, by the producing the &s;pecial authority of government. But they mu&s;t be interpreted by tho&s;e before mentioned and con&s;i&s;tently with them. They cannot be con&s;trued &s;o as to overturn the others. It would be the mo&s;t downright ab&s;urdity and the mo&s;t direct contradiction in it&s;elf, to talk of a Grant or Patent or Charter of rights given to any one to take away all the rights he had in the world, to confer on him the privilege of having nothing of his own now, nor of being able to acquire any &s;uch thing in time to come, neither he him&s;elf or his de&s;cendants after him. Every thing of this kind mu&s;t be under&s;tood &s;o as to coincide with the original, inherent rights of any &s;ingle per&s;on or com|munity, whether as men or as Britons.</P>
<P>Charters would without doubt be for &s;ome purpo&s;es very effectual, if every thing would take place as it is written on a paper or parchment. Suppo&s;e a parcel of mi&s;erable peo|ple &s;tarved out of their native country or per&s;ecuted and pro&s;ecuted there, becau&s;e they don't believe ju&s;t what &s;ome other men do or pretend to do; that they cannot leave their homes without the con&s;ent of their per&s;ecutors; that they mu&s;t take with them a piece of parchment, did their
<PB N="17" REF="013582_0015_0F90FC68450FD278">
tyrants write thereon, that their de&s;cendants &s;hould go upon all fours, &s;hall be born with hoofs in&s;tead of hands and with in&s;tinct in&s;tead of rea&s;on and the faculty of &s;peech, and that the&s;e things would &s;o happen; this might to be &s;ure give very notable powers over them: they might then be yoked as horned cattle, &s;addled and bridled as hor&s;es, or fleeced and &s;heared as &s;heep; the difference in the &s;pecies would naturally and nece&s;&s;arily effect this; but nothing of all this will come to pa&s;s. This future offspring will notwith|&s;tanding be born with the nature, the qualities and the talents and con&s;equently with the claims, the rights and privileges of men. But &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e &s;trange terms to be on account of the ab&s;urdity of them dropped, but that there are in&s;tead really entered on the parchment or charter &s;uch an arbitrary &s;uperiority, &s;uch de&s;potic and uncontroulable powers and prerogatives over the&s;e poor people and their po&s;terity, as are only &s;itting, &s;uitable and analogus to the former circum&s;tances, will this in right or in rea&s;on be a whit more valid than the other, or where is the &s;en&s;e or ju&s;tice in demanding &s;uch enormous con&s;equences when we are forbidden the unnatural premi&s;es, from which alone they can follow? Suppo&s;e that it was on a paper or parch|ment written in fair characters; that the hor&s;es and cattle of the New Fore&s;t in Hamp&s;hire &s;hould have to them and their heirs forever the &s;aid Fore&s;t and it might be added to hold in free &s;occage of the manor of Ea&s;t-Greenwich; &s;up|po&s;e that dents were made in the paper or parchment and a &s;tamp put upon it, and that it was &s;igned, &s;ealed, and de|livered as an act and deed; what would be the effect? It would be an&s;wered that it would be a thing to laugh at; for how &s;hould brute bea&s;ts take property, who have neither under&s;tanding or capacity or any means for that purpo&s;e; that it would be contrary to nature for them &s;o to do. But let me demand in my turn, where is the difference in the effect, whether it is written that the bea&s;ts &s;hall become men or that men &s;hall become bea&s;ts; that a number of bea&s;ts &s;hall be able to take and hold property or that a community of men &s;hall not? The one is ju&s;t as contrary to nature as the other. It might indeed be a happy day for de&s;po|ti&s;m, could &s;uch things be done; but they are beyond its &s;trength. The great Author of the world has for the tran&s;cendent purpo&s;es of his unfathonable wi&s;dom placed in
<PB N="18" REF="013582_0016_0F90FC68645AAFB8">
the hearts of men, pride, ambition, avarice and &s;elf-inter|e&s;t; but he has at the &s;ame time been plea&s;ed with his mo&s;t benevolent hand and by the laws of nature and the cour&s;e of things to &s;et bounds to the power of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which they can pa&s;s no more, than the &s;ea can exceed its &s;hores.</P>
<P>So much for charters in general. However! will like|wi&s;e &s;ay &s;omething concerning one particular charter before I leave the &s;ubject. When the havock among charters happened in England a &s;hort time before the revolution and which contributed not a little to produce that event, America was not &s;pared. About the year &s;ixteen hundred eighty-four a quo warranto was on that head i&s;&s;ued again&s;t Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay. Some of the colonies did on the like occa&s;ion give way and throw them&s;elves on the plea&s;ure of the King. Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay refu&s;ed to do this. They were exparte and for non-appearance condemned and their charter &s;hared the &s;ame fate as that of the city of London and &s;o many others. Four years afterwards the Revolution happened. As &s;oon as ever the news of it arrived at Bo&s;ton the colony declared in favour of it. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of King James's Governor and of the re&s;t of his creatures and &s;ent them all home to England. But then it will per|haps be &s;aid, they recovered in return their charter. Is there almo&s;t faith in man to believe otherwi&s;e? Other colo|lonies fared well enough, who had not with&s;tood the will of the King, and who&s;e charters had not been vacated in the court of ju&s;tice. They did them&s;elves put them again in execution and no words were made. Our own charters here at home were likewi&s;e returned. The colony of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;et's-Bay went on that account fir&s;t into the Convention Parliament; but there they could not get through. It is well known that our Parliaments are not u&s;ually di&s;&s;olved or prorogued, while any bu&s;ine&s;s is depending, which there is an inclination to pa&s;s. They had then nothing left but to beg and pray of the King's Mini&s;ters. But is it credi|ble that they could not procure the re&s;toration of their charter of the&s;e Revolution Mini&s;ters, of the&s;e Makers and Unmakers of Kings, who had &s;o lately been on the &s;ame bottom with them and in who&s;e cau&s;e the colony had &s;o readily declared it&s;elf, but who had now obtained their own ends? Tired out therefore with delays and not being &s;ure of the wor&s;t that might happen, they were obliged in the
<PB N="19" REF="013582_0017_0F90FC6927D816A8">
end to accept of a new charter mutilated and ca&s;trated of many of the mo&s;t important and e&s;&s;ential privileges of the old. I &s;hall take notice of no other particulars, than that before they cho&s;e annually their own Governor, Deputy|Governor and Secretary. The&s;e were from this time to be appointed during plea&s;ure by the King. Of what extreme con&s;equence the change in the nomination of the&s;e their three Chief Officers has proved to them, no man at all ac|quainted with the name of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay can be &s;o ig|norant of their hi&s;tory, as not to be informed and &s;en&s;ible. Hence their differences with their own Governors there and with our own Mini&s;ters at home. Hence their pre&s;ent Mili|tary Governor and the armies and fleets now gone or going again&s;t them. Hence the &s;trange provi&s;ion &s;aid to be in agitation, that their blood may not be liable to be an&s;wered for there. They would otherwi&s;e in all appearance be at this moment on the&s;e &s;ubjects in the &s;ame &s;ituation, as their neighbours of Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land, with who&s;e charters their own agreed, until they lo&s;t it by their re&s;i&s;t|ance and oppo&s;ition to the will of the two la&s;t Stuarts; when the others &s;aved theirs by giving way. I &s;hall leave my readers to judge, whether it was the good or the evil contain|ed in this poor piece of parchment which thus united again&s;t it Stuart-Kings and Revolution Mini&s;ters. But this char|ter mu&s;t certainly have been granted under an evil planet, if what &s;ome people &s;ay be true; that it is now again un|der di&s;plea&s;ure at home and on the brink of being once more rever&s;ed and altered. But that event has not on the writing of this happened. I am therefore perfectly per|&s;waded, that &s;hould any thing of that kind take place, it will on the contrary be the re&s;toration of tho&s;e its former privileges and powers, which was &s;o unrea&s;onably and &s;o unju&s;tly denied at the Revolution. But let any one con&s;i|der this hi&s;tory of a charter and then reflect, whether man|kind have not rea&s;on to ble&s;s them&s;elves, that they have &s;ome rights of a higher nature than charters, &s;uperior to them and independent of them.</P>
<P>But are not we the parent country? That is a very re&s;pectable word, but &s;o likewi&s;e is the relation of it mutual. It has always hitherto had its full weight with our colonies of North-America and will probably continue to have, if we can content our&s;elves with any tolerably rea&s;onable &s;en&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="013582_0018_0F90FC69EC0E03E0">
and u&s;e of it. But was every ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of a fa|mily re&s;ident there the immediate &s;on and daughter of a father and mother living now at this time in England; yet they being gone from us and having e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves and got families of their own, and having acquired a large territory, we could by no means even as true and real pa|rents make out any claim having &s;uch con&s;equences, as that which we advance. However the fact is very different; they left us in former times a part of the publick, as well as others; they are &s;ince become hardly our cou&s;in's cou&s;ins, and no man knows how far we might mount towards Adam or Noah to &s;ettle the real relation between us. But was their hi&s;tory told, as it de&s;erves: How they have made the&s;e their great e&s;tabli&s;hments at their own charge and with almo&s;t no expence of ours: How we have ever had the total command of the produce of that immen&s;e country, &s;o as to regulate the commerce and exportation of it merely according to our own advantage and convenience; that this is grown to be an object of perhaps no le&s;s than four millions &s;terling a year, all turned towards our profit; could the extreme benefit be all &s;et forth, which we have by this means received from the fir&s;t foundation of the&s;e colonies to this time and the chearfulne&s;s, fidelity and loyalty where|with they have &s;ubmitted to this; the &s;incere and warm friend&s;hip and affection, which they have ever born us, while we kept our&s;elves within the&s;e bounds; the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which we have received from them in war, as well as the profits in peace; could all the&s;e circum&s;tances be with very many others favourable to them told and repre&s;ented to|gether and in their full light, the &s;tory it&s;elf would bid fair to make the&s;e har&s;h and unmerited Acts of Parliament drop out of our hands, if we held them at the time. However at lea&s;t don't let us extend a figurative and metaphorical &s;aying to the dive&s;ting of all their properties near upon two millions of people and make it at the &s;ame time a warrant for our&s;elves to hold towards them an unju&s;t, rapacious and unnatural conduct, directly contrary to that of real parents towards their children, and totally incon&s;i&s;tent with the expre&s;&s;ion, whereon we would ground our preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>But how do the&s;e projectors and promoters of taxes and taxing hold concerning Ireland? Do they reckon that to be likewi&s;e within the juri&s;dictioa of their ways and means
<PB N="21" REF="013582_0019_0F90FC6AA86C5BB0">
and in the &s;ame predicament with America? Adventurers went formerly from hence, others &s;ucceeded, more followed, until they were ma&s;ters of the i&s;land. It might be added, that this was done with a much greater expence of the blood and trea&s;ure of this country than our &s;ettlements in Ame|rica ever co&s;t us. The Repre&s;entative body of Ireland is called a Parliament; that of America an A&s;&s;embly. The term of kingdom obtains in one country and that of colony in the other. Is there any charm in the &s;ound of the&s;e words which makes a difference or would the author of the Stamp-Act have gone thither al&s;o; had the people of Ame|rica &s;hewn a facility to his fir&s;t attempts with them and if the Parliament of Ireland had ever made difficulties to his future demands there? Does any one imagine that learned or other arguments would have been wanting to maintain the rectitude of the one mea&s;ure, any more than of the other?</P>
<P>But is there any medium? Mu&s;t not we either rigorou&s;ly enforce obedience from our colonies or at once generou&s;ly declare them free and independent of all allegiance to the crown of Great-Britain? To which I an&s;wer if there is a medium between Great Britain and Ireland, why may there not be al&s;o between Great Britain and North America? The claims of the colonies are not higher than tho&s;e of Ireland. Certain rules of mutual re&s;pect pre&s;erved between us and that neighbouring part of the King's dominions keep us on the be&s;t and happie&s;t terms together, terms of perpetual and almo&s;t un&s;peakable pro|fit and advantage to England. Does this overturn the con&s;titution of Great-Britain or weaken the dependency on its crown, as &s;ome language has been? Why &s;hould not then forberance, moderation and regard towards that a little more di&s;tant portion of our country produce in the one ca&s;e, effects con&s;onant and an&s;werable to what the like cau&s;es do in the other? It is mo&s;t evident and may in ge|neral be depended on, that no evil con&s;equences can hap|pen from any condition or &s;ituation between Great-Britain and her colonies, which does actually and advantageou&s;ly obtain between Great Britain and Ireland. How was it there twenty years ago, before the fir&s;t or the la&s;t of the&s;e taxes were either of them thought of? All was then peace calm and content. The repealing the fir&s;t of them, the
<PB N="22" REF="013582_0020_0F90FC6B64FE0C08">
Stamp Act, did that do any mi&s;chief? Not unle&s;s the re|conciling, uniting and connecting again all the parts of our government be &s;uch. There was hardly any where to be found a man, but who was plea&s;ed and happy in the mea|&s;ure; except a mini&s;ter or two at home, who lo&s;t their power and their places on the occa&s;ion and except a few &s;y|cophants abroad, who hoped to recommend them&s;elves by traducing and di&s;turbing tho&s;e, to whom they owed a&s;&s;i&s;|tance and protection, and who de&s;ired to fi&s;h in troubles, which they them&s;elves contribution greatly to create. What evil &s;tar reigns then at this period, that the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings can|not now take place as they formerly did?</P>
<P>I have on this &s;ubject no mind to play with the name of Ireland. I pre&s;ume to introduce on the &s;cene and to cou|ple, as it were, with America that country only in order to expo&s;e the more plainly by the in&s;tance of the one &s;ome no|tions advanced concerning the other and at the &s;ame time to the utmo&s;t of my &s;mall power to recommend, inculcate and enforce that cautious, con&s;iderate, brotherly and affec|tionate conduct towards each, which I am &s;ure that they both of them mo&s;t exceedingly well de&s;erve, whether of the government or of the people of England.</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes made a claim on the Americans, that we incurred on their account a great expence in the late war.</P>
<P>On who&s;e account have we not &s;ince the Revolution in|curred a great expence? Our whole hi&s;tory from that time to this is little el&s;e, but a &s;conce of prodigality in the &s;er|vice of different People or Princes, for which no man can give any good rea&s;on. However I an&s;wer on this occa&s;ion with the fact. We did not engage in the late war at the reque&s;t of the Americans nor upon any de&s;ire or inclination of theirs. The language at the time was on the contrary, that the le&s;s concerned the inhabitants of our colonies ap|peared to be about the encroachments of the French, the more rea&s;on we had to be jealous on the &s;ubject. I believe that I may in &s;upport of what I am &s;aying venture to ap|peal to tho&s;e, who are the be&s;t acquainted with that peri|od. Had it been otherwi&s;e, we &s;hould no doubt have heard enough of it. Sub&s;tantial rea&s;ons might be given, that the Americans judged better in the ca&s;e, than we. There may be ground for us to condemn our&s;elves for not having con|&s;ulted them more on the &s;ubject, than we did, before that
<PB N="23" REF="013582_0021_0F90FC6C276FA078">
we were &s;o ha&s;ty to take up the hatchet. However there is not the lea&s;t pretence for charging to their account the con&s;equences of a war, which we undertook without any in&s;tance and application from them and entirely of our own motion.</P>
<P>But the honour of Government is concerned. That is certainly an unaccountable rea&s;oning, though not perhaps very uncommon; that if Government or in plain Engli&s;h, the Mini&s;ter and tho&s;e about him do a thing which &s;hall be wi&s;hed to be undone, they are therefore to proceed in the &s;ame road and do many more &s;uch, until at length the ca&s;e may perhaps be beyond redre&s;s. Surely the more credit is lo&s;t the deeper that people are plunged into mi&s;chief. The welfare and happine&s;s of five or &s;ix millions of man|kind or more is a prodigious object. Whoever puts him|&s;elf at the helm of our State undertakes in a manner for that. We are all mortal and fallible. One in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion had need to march with the utmo&s;t caution, circum|&s;pection and fore&s;ight; &s;hould he make an unlucky &s;tep, it is his highe&s;t duty to endeavour in&s;tantly to retreat and retrieve it. A late Mini&s;ter repealed an Act &s;imilar to the one in que&s;tion and that State&s;man well knew what to do and what to avoid. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e a gulph is before us, which will not admit many &s;teps forwards, but that the Government and the Public will both go headlong.</P>
<P>But their outrages. I pre&s;ume the&s;e to be an object of di&s;cour&s;e, as well as any other &s;ubject; how can they other|wi&s;e be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and con&s;idered? However I &s;hall without declaring any opinion of my own take them up only in the light, as they may appear to an American. He will cer|tainly &s;ay, that the&s;e receive their complexion from the claim of the colonies not to be taxed by us and accordingly as that &s;hall be grounded or not. If that is not well founded, that then their whole oppo&s;ition is unlawful, whether only concert and combination or force or violence. That the latter indeed may be productive of more mi&s;chief than the former, but that they are on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition both of them entirely unwarrantable. I would in this ca&s;e willingly &s;peak freely but without offence; he would therefore cer|tainly add, that &s;hould the Americans on the other hand have a real right not to be &s;o taxed, they are undoubtedly intitled likewi&s;e to the nece&s;&s;ary means of u&s;ing and enjoy|ing

that right. That this is a rule of the law of nature as well as of the law of the land or rather that the latter has only borrowed it from the former. I &s;peak with great &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; but he would without doubt proceed, that the means u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion were ab&s;olutely tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary ones and no other; that an object was artfully or judici|ou&s;ly cho&s;en for this tax, which is &s;o con&s;tant a part of diet or luxury, that it was totally impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the tax from taking place without hindering the commodity it&s;elf from being introduced; that therefore the Americans mu&s;t ab&s;olutely do that or lo&s;e their right; that the endeavour|ing to do it by a general concert and agreement would have been no better than building a city out of the &s;ands of the &s;ea; that thereupon the town of Bo&s;ton did at a &s;ort of public meeting u&s;e every in&s;tance and application po&s;&s;ible both with the Captains of the tea &s;hips and with the Governor, that the tea might be returned, untouched and undamaged as it came; that this would have &s;ecured their right and they de&s;ired no more; that this was ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed; that there was thereupon no expedient left for the pre&s;erving their right but de&s;troying the tea; that this was without any expre&s;s authority of the town done by private people, but in all appearance with the general in|clination and with the lea&s;t mi&s;chief and damage po&s;&s;ible; that there was &s;ome tea &s;pilt, but no blood; that this refers the whole to the fir&s;t and original que&s;tion of the right; that the Americans make thereon the &s;ame claim, as the people of Scotland would have in an e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance of the Union or tho&s;e of Ireland, &s;hould the line ob&s;erved between them and Great-Britain be pa&s;&s;ed in any point, which would affect their whole intere&s;t and welfare, as a nation; that in the other colonies the Governors and Cap|tains con&s;ented to the &s;ending back the tea or &s;hutting it up in &s;uch a manner as never to be &s;old or di&s;per&s;ed; that the&s;e did not therefore in their ca&s;es make immediate force nece&s;&s;ary, but that their act was in effect the &s;ame and &s;tands on the &s;ame ground. That there is nothing malig|nant in the whole matter, nothing but a determined de&s;ire to &s;upport this their great and nece&s;&s;ary right. This is no doubt the American idea, as appears by many proofs and papers from that &s;ide the water. I &s;hall my&s;elf pre&s;ume to &s;peak no opinion in the ca&s;e, much le&s;s will I call again

on the manes of our ance&s;tors in &s;upport of this preten&s;ion. But &s;hould it be ob&s;erved, that it ends in a que&s;tion, which concerns the bounds and limits of government; I cannot on the occa&s;ion but repeat and enforce by this example the remark before made, of how dangerous and deadly a nature the di&s;putes and conte&s;ts are, which lead thither.</P>
<P>So much for the rectitude of taxing the Americans! But I may be told that I have not yet touched the true point, that I have been doing little more, than a man, who rides po&s;t out of his road. That State&s;men and Politicians do indeed &s;ometimes talk of the right and wrong, of the ju&s;tice and ju&s;tice of mea&s;ures; but that this is all only o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;oning, while there may be at the bottom nothing, which they really care le&s;s about. That the Great do every where bear hard on the Little, the &s;trong on the weak. That the hawk hunts the partridge, the lion the wolf, and the wolf the lamb; that powerful Princes and States oppre&s;s the Helple&s;s, and the High and the Rich tho&s;e beneath them; that this is the cour&s;e of the world and the chapter of the law of nature, which we intend to con&s;ult and to follow; that we want money at home; that our debts are very heavy and our re&s;ources but too nearly at an end; that we have yet fleets and armies and are determined to bend to our will our colonies of America, and to make them &s;ub&s;er|vient to our wants and occa&s;ions; that this is at the bottom and that all my ca&s;ui&s;try may in the mean time &s;erve the purpo&s;es of grocers and pa&s;try cooks; that if people mu&s;t write about matters of &s;tate they ought to do it like men. Very well; I join i&s;&s;ue hereon, only don't let us go too fa&s;t; one thing at a time.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer that you cannot force them nor is there any appearance that you can. The number of free people in tho&s;e colonies is reckoned at towards two millions. The common calculation is of one &s;encible or fighting man in five per&s;ons and this is &s;uppo&s;ed to be rather under than over the truth. This will give us at lea&s;t between three and four hundred thou&s;and fighting men on the number before mentioned. Mr. Rome tells us indeed in &s;ome letters &amp;c. lately publi&s;hed in oppo&s;ition to the colonies; <Q>that there is hardly any thing more common, than to hear them boa&s;t of particular colonies that can rai&s;e on a &s;hort no|tice a hundred thou&s;and fighting men.</Q> However to
<PB N="26" REF="013582_0024_0F90FC710050D368">
have nothing to do with the&s;e exaggerations and to take only the number before mentioned; what expectation can there be of &s;ending from hence an army fit to &s;ubdue that continent, a country not defended indeed on the &s;ide of the &s;ea with forts and ca&s;tles built by men, but extreamly &s;trong within by the natural fortifications of fore&s;ts and rivers.</P>
<P>But can they arm &s;o many? In any country very greatly taxed and much more &s;o than its inhabitants would wil|lingly bear with, it is impo&s;&s;ible con&s;i&s;tently with &s;uch a &s;tate of things to arm the whole body of the people. The&s;e might be apt to count no&s;es and to con&s;ider who were the &s;tronger, they them&s;elves or the tax gatherers and the Red|coats or White coats or Black coats or any other, who &s;up|port them. The difficulty would be yet greater, were there any further di&s;&s;atisfaction. But the&s;e are all democratical governments, where the power is in the hands of the peo|ple and where there is not the lea&s;t difficulty or jealou&s;y about putting arms into the hands of every man in the country.</P>
<P>But are they united among them&s;elves? In the cau&s;e of not being taxed by us it is well under&s;tood, how much they are &s;o. All accounts and reports from thence of all men and of all parties run in that &s;tile and concur in that cir|cum&s;tance It was &s;o experienced to a very great degree concerning the &s;tamps and has now been found the &s;ame on the occa&s;ion of the Tea. Their conduct has in this ca&s;e been every where alike and corre&s;pondent. The Tea is either returned without being landed or received without being &s;uffered to be &s;old, at New-York, at Penn&s;ylvania, at Carolina, at all the places to which it was &s;ent. We reck|on entirely without our ho&s;t, if we don't expect to have to do with a union of that continent or depend on any mea|&s;ures in&s;ufficient to &s;ubdue the whole.</P>
<P>But let me a&s;k; how can we expect otherwi&s;e? They are not unacquainted with the hi&s;tory of the mother coun|try They know the weight of the taxing hand here. They have heard of our debt of one hundred and forty millions of pounds &s;terling incurrred &s;ince the Revolution be&s;ides other hundreds of millions &s;pent currently within the &s;ame period The time to come is to be judged of by the time pa&s;t. Will our brethren of America expect, that this hand &s;hould be lighter on them at a di&s;tance or that
<PB N="27" REF="013582_0025_0F90FC72300292B8">
our brea&s;ts will feel more for them than for our&s;elves? Let an Engli&s;hman make the ca&s;e his own and que&s;tion him&s;elf; what he &s;hould think were he of that country and his whole fortune and concerns there. Would not he believe his all to be at &s;take upon the ca&s;t? Does any one in America or in England imagine, that all the&s;e di&s;putes and feuds are only at the bottom about a duty of three pence upon a pound of tea? How can then any candid man doubt, whe|ther there will be a general union and concurrence on the &s;ubject or wonder if there is &s;o?</P>
<P>They are &s;aid to have already Committees of Corre&s;pon|dence and no doubt nece&s;&s;ity will teach them other means of moving and acting together. Every thing is there by choice and election; they will probably have at their head as ca|pable and as wi&s;e men, as are to be found among them. The power and influence of Governors and other civil offi|cers appointed from hence, mu&s;t on an open rupture have an end. Our authority would perhaps then extend little further, than where it was enforced by our own troops.</P>
<P>But what are an untrained and undi&s;ciplined multitude? Could not an experienced officer with a few regular regi|ments do what he would in America? I an&s;wer, that a different &s;tory may be told. In the war before la&s;t our mea|&s;ures directed at home were every where un&s;ucce&s;sful. The plains of Flanders were fatten'd with &s;ome of the be&s;t blood of Britain and of Ireland. Our government was &s;haken al|mo&s;t to the foundation by a rebellion contemptible in its be|ginning. Were we more fortunate in our attempt by &s;ea again&s;t Pondicherry or that afterwards again&s;t Port I 'Ori|ent? But the people of New England maintained at that time the honour of our arms. It is well known, that they carried on with their own coun&s;els and with their own &s;ol|diery and under the command of one of their own planters again&s;t Cape Breton and Loui&s;bourg an expedition, the e|vent of which need not now be told. We did not begin in a much better manner the la&s;t war. I am unwilling to call to mind our fir&s;t campaigns in Germany, our &s;ituation and treaty of Clo&s;ter-Severn, the fate of Minorca or the hi&s;tories of Bradock and Abercrombie. But who were at that time the fir&s;t to &s;tem the tide of our ill fortune! Was not it an American militia who commanded by Sir William John&s;on, a gentleman at that time of the country met, fought and
<PB N="28" REF="013582_0026_0F90FC73C0BED390">
beat the French and Indians under Mon&s;ieur Die&s;kau, and made pri&s;oner their commander? But what wonders were afterwards done by our people properly conducted and direc|ted? It is very true, and I am &s;ure, that I have no inclination to depreciate them. But neither did tho&s;e of America want their &s;hare therein. However the courage of our country|men was never yet que&s;tioned; but may they always unite and employ it again&s;t our common enemies and never be encamped or embattled again&s;t one another either in Ame|rica or any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>But we are ma&s;ters at &s;ea and wherever our &s;hips can come. We may do, whatever a fleet can. Very true; but it cannot &s;ail all over North America. It is &s;aid, that Mar|&s;hal Saxe had before the declaration of the la&s;t war but one, and at the time of our army being in Germany, conceived a de&s;ign to have landed on our coa&s;t with ten thou&s;and men, and to have tried the fortune of a bri&s;k march to London He did not find this &s;o ea&s;y to execute as he thought for. He was mo&s;t happily di&s;appointed. But there was an ob|ject. No one can tell the con&s;equence, had he &s;ucceeded. The pre&s;ent is a very different matter No immediate im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the town of Bo&s;ton nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion taken of it by means of a fleet nor the &s;ame circum&s;tance with regard to any other towns of America liable thereto by their &s;ituation will carry the command of that whole continent or force it to &s;ubmit to mea&s;ures &s;o univer&s;ally again&s;t their bent and inclination.</P>
<P>It may however be &s;aid that this is not the plan. The charter of the town of Bo&s;ton is to be changed and their trade &s;u&s;pended and other mea&s;ure of the very &s;tronge&s;t &s;ort to be enforced again&s;t them. The moving mountain is according to the imagination of Dr. Swift to hang over them and the &s;un not &s;hine or the rain or the dew to fall on them until they are brought to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and made to the re&s;t of America an example of the danger of refractorine&s;s and di&s;obedience to the mother country; all which we think may and will with time be compa&s;&s;ed and accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>This is indeed as to the que&s;tion of force the true point of the matter; I mean, which will at la&s;t and at the end of a long trial get the better; but I add, that this will proba|bly not be Great-Britain. Here I mu&s;t again crave leave to write with freedom. If it is the fir&s;t wi&s;dom of a private man to know him&s;elf; &s;o mu&s;t it likewi&s;e be that of a State
<PB N="29" REF="013582_0027_0F90FC74997D40D8">
to con&s;ider in all its mea&s;ures its own condition and &s;itua|tion. The &s;earching into our circum&s;tances neither makes or mars them. But what mu&s;t be our ca&s;e, &s;hould we have any wound or mi&s;chief and that it might not be probed or examined? We mu&s;t ever &s;uppo&s;e our adver&s;aries to be in|formed and not by &s;hutting our own eyes pretend to blind other people. I &s;hall therefore without &s;cruple enquire into the &s;tate of the public, as far as it concerns my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The condition of the great &s;taple manufactures of our country is well known. Tho&s;e of the linen and the &s;ilk are in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and the woolen and the linen are now publickly banded and contending again&s;t one another. One part of our people is &s;tarving at home on the alms of their pari&s;hes and another running abroad to this very country, that we are contending with. The produce of North America u&s;ed to be &s;ent yearly to Britain is reckon|ed at about four millions &s;terling; the manufactures of Bri|tain and other commodities returned from hence at nearly the &s;ame &s;um; the debts due from people in America to the Briti&s;h merchants here at about &s;ix millions or a year and a half of that commerce. I &s;ay, the time pa&s;t mu&s;t be our guide with re&s;pect to that to come. Suppo&s;ing there|fore the Americans to act in this ca&s;e, as they did in that of the Stamp Act; we &s;hall then have yearly until the final &s;ettlement of this affair manufactures to the value of four millions &s;terling left and heaped on the hands of our mer|chants and ma&s;ter manufacturers or we &s;hall have workmen and poor people put out of employ and turned adrift in that proportion. There will likewi&s;e be withdrawn from our home con&s;umption and out of our general trade and traffick North American commodities to the &s;ame value, and debts will to the immen&s;e &s;um above mentioned be with held from private people here. This was the train of things begun before and we mu&s;t look for the like again. What effects the&s;e things will produce con&s;idering the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of our trade, manufactures and manufacturers, the condition of our poor at home and the numbers of our people running abroad, it don't want many words to ex|plain and &s;et forth. They were before very &s;everely felt for the time, that they la&s;ted and it is apprehended, that the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the Public is yet more liable to the impre&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are &s;ome of the difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="30" REF="013582_0028_0F90FC75285FA1E0">
which we are for the &s;ake of a trail of &s;kill with our colo|nies going to bring on our&s;elves and which mu&s;t be perpe|tually magnifying and increa&s;ing, as long as the unnatural conte&s;t &s;hall continue.</P>
<P>To the&s;e a former admini&s;tration gave way; but it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the pre&s;ent has by returning to he &s;hock re&s;olved to be more callous on the occa&s;ion and to leave the Americans, the merchants and the manufacturers to &s;ettle among them&s;elves their matters as they may. Our people will indeed be le&s;s clamorous about the ears of their betters if they &s;hall all run and emigrate out of the kingdom. But there is a circum&s;tance not yet mentioned, which will bid fair to go further and which may but too probably involve in one common confu&s;ion the nation, the government and the admini&s;tration it&s;elf. I mean the danger of a di&s;order or failure of the public revenue, the difficulty or impo&s;&s;ibi|lity to pay the intere&s;t of the debt, the navy, the army the civil li&s;t and our other expences; if the pre&s;ent contention &s;hall proceed and continue.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire in explanation of this to con&s;ider our pre&s;ent in|come, our out goings and our re&s;ources. I will not enter into any detail thereon; the particulars in gro&s;s will be &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e before us. I will however in or|der to be the better under&s;tood premi&s;e &s;omething about the revenue in general. It may be divided into two parts, the one of taxes laid in perpetuity, the other of &s;uch as are granted by the year and for the year. The fir&s;t part con&s;i&s;ts of all our taxes in general what&s;oever, except the Land tax. and the annual Malt-tax; the latter con&s;i&s;ts of the&s;e two only. Perpetual taxes are now in the language of Europe often expre&s;&s;ed by the name of funds, as affording a fixed and &s;ettled foundation for any &s;pecial u&s;e and particularly for that of borrowing money. It was to an&s;wer the intere&s;t of our debts, that our own funds were e&s;tabli&s;hed and they are now pledged for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e of ours have been chiefly thrown into three great common ones called the General, the Aggregate and the South Sea Funds. The&s;e are &s;ometimes with all other funds or perpetual taxes what&s;oever de&s;tined and &s;ettled for the di&s;charge of the in|tere&s;t of our debt comprehended and united together in di&s;cour&s;e and called the Sinking Fund; although there is in reality no one particular Fund of that name, any more
<PB N="31" REF="013582_0029_0F90FC75EDCFAD28">
than there is &s;uch a piece of money as a pound &s;terling or a French livre. The civil li&s;t is placed on the &s;ame Funds, as the intere&s;t of the Public Debt. What remains annually of the whole collection of tho&s;e Funds after the &s;atisfying the&s;e two incumbrances is, what is meant by the &s;urplus of the Sinking Fund. I have thought proper to preface the&s;e few things, that my own language may at lea&s;t be under&s;tood, in what little I &s;hall &s;ay on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of our debt amounts to near upon five mil|lions a year; all annuities for lives or years, every thing redeemable or irredeemable included. The Civil Li&s;t is eight hundred thou&s;and pounds a year. The &s;urplus of the Sinking Fund is changing and uncertain, that being compo&s;ed of very many variable parts. It is impo&s;&s;ible to fix it, but I will at an average for the &s;ake of round num|bers &s;uppo&s;e it to be two millions and more, about as much more as will an&s;wer to what the intere&s;t of the debt may want of five millions. We &s;hall then have about &s;even millions three quarters for the produce of our perpetual Taxes and Funds. Our annual taxes remain then only to be con&s;idered which are ea&s;ily reckoned; the Land-tax granted for a million and an half at three &s;hillings in the pound, as it now is; the Malt-tax always granted at three quarters of a million. The&s;e &s;ums put together give us a|bout ten millions of pounds &s;terling, being our pre&s;ent annu|al national income and likewi&s;e our pre&s;ent annual national expence; including what may at times be paid towards the di&s;charge of the Public Debt and be&s;ides the collection, which is not to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. Should any one be of opinion, that the &s;urplus of the Sinking Fund is either over charged or undercharged, he has my con&s;ent to make &s;uch addition to it or &s;ubtraction from it, as he &s;hall plea&s;e. Neither the one or the other will affect the argument which I am upon. Our receipts and di&s;bur&s;ments will in either ca&s;e go hand in hand. I &s;hall therefore without any more nice di&s;qui&s;ition take the&s;e at the medium of about ten millions &s;terling each.</P>
<P>So much for our income and our expences. Let us next con&s;ider our re&s;ources; I mean what re&s;ources we may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have in our power without creating any new debt. The fir&s;t to occur will be the &s;urplus of the Sinking Fund. We apply to cour&s;e to this on almo&s;t all occa&s;ions.
<PB N="32" REF="013582_0030_0F90FC76ABB3E1A8">
We are by law obliged to di&s;charge regularly the intere&s;t of our debt; but whatever we may be in prudence and a proper care of our&s;elves and of tho&s;e after us, we are by no contract or engagement bound to do more or to pay off any part of the principal of it. This &s;urplus is therefore one re&s;ource; but it is &s;uch no otherwi&s;e or further, than it can be &s;pared from our current expenoes, towards which it is commonly in whole or in part taken. We can for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e reckon only on &s;o much of it, as might otherwi&s;e be employed towards le&s;&s;ening the capital of our debt. We have now had twelve years of peace, in which time I reckon, that we have di&s;charged about eight mil|lions of that capital. This will therefore at an average give us by the year too thirds of a million or &s;omething more than &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds. This is what we may look to for one of our re&s;ources. But we have likewi&s;e another, which is the Land tax. That is now at three &s;hillings in the pound, but it is &s;ometimes at four. We may therefore count in ca&s;e of exigency on one &s;hilling more, that is on half a million. The&s;e two &s;ums amount together to about one million one hundred thou&s;and pounds. The&s;e are our re&s;ources and without borrowing the&s;e are all.</P>
<P>Let us next turn in our thoughts, whether the&s;e eleven hundred thou&s;and pounds a year, being a little more than a tenth part of our pre&s;ent income, are likely to be &s;ufficient for this American occa&s;ion. Fleets and armies, &s;hips of war and regiments are the means, the Tip-&s;taves and the Con&s;tables, which are to execute the mea&s;ures in que&s;tion. A million goes but a very little way with us in &s;uch arti|cles. This bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t in it conclude a &s;uppo&s;ition, that all our colonies, all our ancient colonies on that continent may in the progre&s;s of it be combined and united in one common a&s;&s;ociation, intere&s;t and defence. There can be no rea&s;onable hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, nothing but mortification and di&s;appointment directly in view by proceeding on any plan, which does not comprehend the probability of that circum&s;tance. What a field is then here opened? Is our million or eleven hundred thou&s;and pounds to furni&s;h us there likewi&s;e? However the&s;e things concern only our expences. Let us con&s;ider the other &s;ide of our &s;ituation; how much our income is at the &s;ame time likely to be le&s;|&s;ened. Four millions &s;terling yearly of the produce of
<PB N="33" REF="013582_0031_0F90FC782F6EF1C0">
America; as many of the merchandize of Great-Britain; more of debts here at home withheld and kept back from our duties, our cu&s;toms and our exci&s;e. What an opera|tion on the revenue! Is our million one hundred thou&s;and pounds to &s;upply all this be&s;ides? How is it po&s;&s;ible either on the one hand. that a per&s;on having the&s;e circum&s;tances before his eyes &s;hould &s;et on foot the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures again&s;t our colonies or on the other, that any one having capacity and under&s;tanding to be at the head of the government and admini&s;tration of a great kingdom &s;hould overlook them? This &s;eems to be like not di&s;cerning the &s;un at noon-day or the moon and the &s;tars by night.</P>
<P>There is from the general condition of our country, but too much rea&s;on to apprehend, that the public revenue is without the&s;e additional cau&s;es finking and decrea&s;ing. This could not but add greatly to our difficulties in the &s;i|tuation before de&s;cribed. However it is to be hoped, that this is only &s;urmi&s;e and opinion. I &s;hall not take it into the pre&s;ent account; but mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly any one at the head of our affairs ought not to forget it in his, if it is true.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, that we will in the &s;uppo&s;ed exi|gency borrow as our predece&s;&s;ors have done before us. I an&s;wer that this may very probably be then out of our power. I will not go upon a general di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, whether we &s;hould enter into another war, with the &s;ame credit we have hitherto had; although we may have but too much rea&s;on to reflect on that &s;ubject. But the con&s;ideration pro|perly before us is, what would be the &s;tate of our credit under a revolt and &s;eparation of &s;ettlements in America, that great and e&s;&s;ential &s;ource of our riches and revenue? Loans and money advanced to us have as yet been reckon|ed equally &s;ecure, there has been no doubt made of the re|gular payment of the intere&s;t nor in con&s;equence of a pub|lic market for the principal, whether we &s;hould our&s;elves happen to be more or le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful on any occa&s;ion, where|in we were at the time concerned and for which they were borrowed. They were as &s;afe under the defeats and di&s;|appointments of the war before, as upon the victories and conque&s;ts of the la&s;t. But things could not in this ca&s;e but be much changed. The &s;ecurity of millions lent mu&s;t depend upon the future chance and fortune of war. It might be made a doubt, what fruits would for &s;ome years

to come be received from provinces mangled and mutilated in a &s;evere conte&s;t decided to their di&s;advantage, &s;hould the&s;e at la&s;t return to us again; but on one could overlook, what mu&s;t be the ca&s;e &s;hould the event terminate again&s;t us and end after an expence of much trea&s;ure and blood in &s;o fatal and ine&s;timable a lo&s;s on our &s;ide, as that of the&s;e co|lonies would be. However no man knows, whether this affair might run into a very long tail. A general breach and defection of the&s;e colonies would cut the &s;inews of our power. We could not mo&s;t probably in &s;uch a &s;ituation long continue to provide and pay the intere&s;t of our mo&s;t enormous debt already incurred and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. It need not be repeated, that it is the a&s;&s;i&s;tance received from their commerce and produce, which enables us now to do it. Deprived of that it will be but to little purpo&s;e for us to be inventing new Funds at home. We have enough of them already. More would only run foul of one another. We may in that day without the operations of a war in Ame|rica, without the &s;ending or &s;upplying fleets or armies at a di&s;tance, without creating new debts, new Funds and new taxes have at our own homes, from our actual &s;ituation, bu|&s;ine&s;s on our hands, but too &s;ufficient to engage and employ us.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, what will be the con&s;equence &s;hould we from the&s;e cau&s;es become unable to pay the intere&s;t of our pre&s;ent debt. I will be bold to &s;ay, that there is no man living wi&s;e enough to an&s;wer that que&s;tion in its ex|tent. Experience teaches men; but there is no proceeding hi&s;tory or tradition of any &s;tate or nation what&s;oever, which can throw &s;ufficient light on that propo&s;ition. There never was before in the world &s;uch a debt contracted or &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, as the Briti&s;h. Letters and books are older than money, I mean than gold and &s;ilver commonly current and having their weight known by a &s;tamp. But there is no occa&s;ion to ran&s;ack ancient times on this &s;ubject. The di&s;covery of Mexico &amp; Peru, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them by the Spaniards is the aera from whence we are to date the beginning of the pre&s;ent plenty in Europe of the&s;e two precious metals, which command often individuals and &s;ometimes common|wealths and kingdoms. The art of Funding was formerly very confined It is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Engli&s;h admini&s;trati|ons, which has carried it to an extent never before known

among men. It is a new experiment in a &s;tate. There is no example of it in the annals of mankind. We are at a lo&s;s where to look for the con&s;equences of &s;uch an unpre|cedented and unheard of deficiency or bankruptcy, as this would prove. However we cannot but have before our eyes di&s;order, anarchy and confu&s;ion; the monied intere&s;t of the nation banded again&s;t the landed and the landed again&s;t the monied; rich monied men brought to beggary and the land drained of the utmo&s;t farthing which can be forced from it; every one catching rending and providing for the pre&s;ent moment; our manufactures and commerce at a &s;tand; the middling people emigrating out of our country and the poor in famine or in &s;edition; foreigners pre&s;&s;ing for their demands and the Dutch particularly in rage and almo&s;t in madne&s;s for their countle&s;s millions tru&s;ted and hazarded in our country; perhaps at the &s;ame time our navy unmanned and our army in mutiny for want of pay. Who can withal tell the end; for the debt, the burthen and the demand will ever remain? There was a time, when the Romans had formerly withdrawn them&s;elves from this i&s;land, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions became here through the weakne&s;s and helple&s;&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e remaining the prize and the prey of all plunderers pirates, robbers and con|querors who came and &s;eized upon them; until that the&s;e people them&s;elves, the Danes, the Saxons and the Normans repleni&s;hed and &s;trengthened again the country. Whether the like &s;cenes will on the &s;ame &s;pot be once more acted or what i&s;&s;ue awaits us, he only knows in who&s;e hands the&s;e events are. But we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expect that the di&s;tant or detached parts of our empire, will fall from us; the &s;tronger and the bigger will probably provide for &amp; govern them&s;elves, the weaker and the le&s;&s;er &s;ick away or &s;eek a|nother ma&s;ter. I don't at all mean that they have any in|clination &s;o to do, where we give no cau&s;e of provocation; but the reins of government will in &s;uch a conjuncture of cour&s;e and of them&s;elves drop out of our hands; we &s;hall no longer be able to hold them No man can tell whether Great-Britain it&s;elf might at that time continue in one or whether it may again be &s;plit and divided into two. There have not been wanting endeavours towards that end. I don't now pretend to decide at who&s;e door this principally lies. It is not perhaps one man or one party only, that is
<PB N="36" REF="013582_0034_0F90FC7B11E056F8">
in fault. There have been on one hand mo&s;t unju&s;t and cruel per&s;ecutions. High and &s;trong re&s;entments of the&s;e are no otherwi&s;e than natural and warrantable. But they have in one re&s;pect been carried to an unrea&s;onable extent. Reflections have been made and continued, where they are totally ungrounded and unmerited. They have hitherto been born with a national good &s;en&s;e, that brings more honour to the parties, than all the ribaldry in the world can ever do them di&s;credit. But who knows, how their effects may be felt in &s;uch a time, as is before de&s;cribed? What a &s;ituation! Britain or England left alone with a debt of hundred and forty millions &s;terling on its head! How can any one have before his eyes &s;uch an event yet run on in he road, which leads directly towards it? We need not perhaps be nice in mea&s;uring our force with that of the Americans; the evil of &s;uch a day will but too &s;ufficiently decide the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>But all is not yet &s;aid which this &s;ubject demands. I have hitherto only con&s;idered us and our colonies as engag|ed between our&s;elves, not a word has been &s;aid of any foreign &s;tate medling in the matter That is yet behind. We mu&s;t look upon our colonies in the light of the provin|ces of Holland when they contended with Spain. The wi&s;h the hand of every man will be again&s;t us. I will not enter into a general di&s;cour&s;e of politics how far it may be for the common good of mankind to &s;plit great &s;tates into &s;mall ones, to divide them into a &s;ize fit to profit and bene|fit others, but not to overbear or di&s;tre&s;s them. Let us con&s;ider the &s;ubject by examples familiar to us. Mexico and Peru are more di&s;tant from Great-Britain, than our colonies of North America, from Spain or France; but were tho&s;e in a &s;tate of defection and &s;eparation from the Spaniards, I wonder, whether we &s;hould find a way to ap|proach them or to avail our&s;elves in any manner of that circum&s;tance. France was pretty well plumed in the la&s;t war; but neverthele&s;s were the reviving or beginning &s;et|tlements of Pondicherry, of Mauritius and Madaga&s;car disjoined from it or its own continent broken once more into &s;everal different parts and &s;eparate governments, would our endeavours contribute to unite them? Should Batavia; the Spice I&s;lands and the Cape of Good Hope revolt from the United Provinces, would not Engli&s;hmen try to profit
<PB N="37" REF="013582_0035_0F90FC7B3798F8A0">
by the conjuncture? I will not touch on the Brazils, that may be a tender point. But would none of all mankind, neither French or Spaniards or Dutch or Portugue&s;e or Danes or Swedes, to &s;ay nothing of the Ru&s;&s;ians or of the new maritime State of Pru&s;&s;ia; would none of them all give directly or indirectly aid, a&s;&s;i&s;tance, encouragement, countenance or protection to our colonies? Would they not trade or traffick with them, would they &s;upply them with nothing wherewith to defend them&s;elves or offend us? Is it very practicable to watch and guard &s;uch immen&s;e coa&s;ts, or do we with all the navy of England in our ports find this &s;o ea&s;y, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e only of Kent and Suffex at home? Did neither England or France &s;upport formerly the &s;even united Provinces in their breach with Spain? Have the French at this time afforded no e&s;&s;ential a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Turks nor another nation to the Ru&s;&s;ians, while each continues at peace with the enemies of their re&s;pective friends? Are the independence of the Briti&s;h co|lonies in North-America and their disjunction from Great|Britain no object to other nations; are not they in parti|cular as much &s;o to France as this Turki&s;h and Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quabble? Was that nation formerly ever wanting to Scot|land or in&s;en&s;ible of its intere&s;t in a&s;&s;i&s;ting that divi&s;ion? I don't at all mean hereby to &s;ignify any attempts or en|deavours of other Governments to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e colonies or any inability in them to defend them&s;elves from that circum&s;tance; but I mean the general de&s;ire and in|clination, which there would a&s;&s;uredly be in all Europe to &s;ee them disjoined from our nation and to become ab&s;olute di&s;tinct, unconnected, independent &s;tates and governments in larger or in &s;maller proportions and more or le&s;s like the pre&s;ent &s;tates of Holland, as it &s;hould happen. Were there in &s;ight &s;uch a condition with re&s;pect of Mexico and Peru or the Dutch &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t Indies would not the Engli&s;h without in&s;i&s;ting on becoming them&s;elves ma&s;ters thereof be mo&s;t abundantly contented with their general advantage re&s;ulting there from? It cannot be doubted&punc; but that there will be found a conduct and actions con&s;equent and corre&s;pondent to &s;uch univer&s;al and almo&s;t unanimous views and wi&s;hes of mankind.</P>
<P>This is all &s;aid on a &s;uppo&s;ition of peace. But what if one or more of the greate&s;t powers in Europe &s;hould in a
<PB N="38" REF="013582_0036_0F90FC7BE23877B0">
mo&s;t critical and difficult moment declare war again&s;t us? Have France and Spain forgot the lo&s;s of Canada and Georgia and the many defeats and di&s;graces received in the la&s;t conte&s;t with us? Have they for their honour or in|tere&s;t no de&s;ire of revenge nor that tho&s;e provinces &s;hould again return to their own crowns? On whom does it depend whether it &s;hall in the ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed be war or peace? Is this to be determined at London, or at Madrid or Ver&s;ailles? Is it in the power and in the brea&s;t of our&s;elves or of tho&s;e, who are mo&s;t our rivals and who&s;e enmity may be &s;aid to be hardly yet cooled? Are four years pa&s;t &s;ince we had two alarms? Is one year gone &s;ince we had one? Should there now be happily at the head of one or other government a Per&s;onage inclined to peace; yet how uncertain are the days of every mortal and how are Princes, Mini&s;ters or States tempted into action by circum&s;tances, opportunities and advantages? Let us well weigh what it is for a private man, but much more for a great nation to part with the means of their pro&s;perity out of their own hands and to place it in the power and determination of tho&s;e, of whom they have on account of a long and ancient rival&s;hip and the continuance of many bloody wars the utmo&s;t rea&s;on to be &s;u&s;picious and jealous.</P>
<P>We cannot too much con&s;ider or reflect upon what hap|pened between Spain and the Dutch Provinces at their breach and &s;eparation. The Spani&s;h Government con&s;i&s;ted at that time, of Spain, of Portugal, of Mexico and Peru and other provinces of America, of the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e being all the European &s;ettlements at that time in the Ea&s;t Indies and of Flanders making &s;eventeen provinces whereof tho&s;e now united and then revolted were only &s;even. How une|qual a match! But yet the battle was not to the &s;trong. The &s;tory and event of their war are well known. I am not about to repeat them. How little did in the beginning the Spaniards or Portugue&s;e or even the Dutch them&s;elves dream that the latter would before long &s;trip and dive&s;t the former of the chief of the&s;e their &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t In|dies and make them their own. They were neverthele&s;s different nations, &s;poke different languages, had different cu&s;toms and religions incon&s;i&s;tent together and were them|&s;elves before the end extremely odious to one another. The Dutch obtain'd nothing except by &s;orce, victory and
<PB N="39" REF="013582_0037_0F90FC7F2C21AF08">
conque&s;t. But &s;urely we are well aware, how different things may in the&s;e re&s;pects be between us and the Ame|ricans and how much to the advantage of the latter. We are one nation, with the &s;ame language the &s;ame manners and the &s;ame religion. Their Seamen, their Soldiers, their People are ours and ours theirs. How ea&s;y will be the tran&s;ition or the change of dependence, protection or go|vernment between one and the other. Our people do al|ready and at this moment &s;eek with them &s;helter and refuge from their dome&s;tic poverty and mi&s;ery. Should ever the&s;e our provinces in the events of chance and time come to look us in the face with any near equality, would it then be a very &s;trange thing, if they &s;hould cau&s;e a general re|volt of all or of almo&s;t all the &s;eamen of the Briti&s;h Empire? The&s;e might not look upon them&s;elves as engaging or act|ing again&s;t their country but as chu&s;ing between two parts of it. They will at their plea&s;ure di&s;tribute the titles of unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t, of injured and oppre&s;&s;ed. The be&s;t terms and the be&s;t treatment will not fail to carry the greater numbers. There is perhaps on the one &s;ide to|wards this brave and de&s;erving body of men a mo&s;t cruel, unju&s;t and impolitic practice which has long cried for ven|geance and which cannot fail to be one day heard and at that moment perhaps as likely as at any other. It is in every one's di&s;cour&s;e, that &s;omething of the &s;ame kind may happen with re&s;pect to our common &s;oldiery; I will not therefore dwell on the point. But what part might our I&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies take at &s;uch a conjuncture? To whom are they the neare&s;t or on whom do they mo&s;t depend for their lumber and other nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tances of their trade? Would there be in the Ea&s;t Indies the &s;ame nece&s;|&s;ity of conque&s;t as the Dutch found? Might more equal conditions or independence it&s;elf be no temptation to one or the other or might it in that day be thought a great &s;in to change the words Old England for New? There is one point &s;o important, &s;o critical, that I hardly know either how to mention or how be &s;ilent in it. Suppo&s;e that Ire|land it&s;elf, I mean the prote&s;tant. opulent and ruling part of Ireland &s;hould grow jealous; &s;hould begin to make com|pari&s;ons between the &s;tate, &s;ituation and relation of the Ame|ricans towards us and their own;&mdash;but I will pa&s;s by this &s;ubject. However I know &s;o well the openne&s;s,
<PB N="40" REF="013582_0038_0F90FC80561FA2A0">
the frankne&s;s and genero&s;ity of that nation, as to be fully a&s;&s;ured, that there are at lea&s;t none of that country who advi&s;e or urge at this time the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures with any di&s;tant or double view to forward and ha&s;ten the inde|pendence of Ireland and that not at its own, but at the co&s;t and hazard of America. The human heart can hardly be conceived to conceal &s;uch my&s;teries. But were it otherwi&s;e, our admini&s;tration would no doubt be &s;en&s;ible of it and in|&s;tead of being impo&s;ed upon be the more upon their guard.</P>
<P>Unhappy are the people, which pur&s;ue tho&s;e &s;teps that their friends mo&s;t fear and their enemies mo&s;t wi&s;h. Were the cabinets of Ver&s;ailles and Madrid or any other the mo&s;t jealous of the power and pro&s;perity of Great-Britain united in Council and that they had it in their option to drive and pu&s;h us for their own advantage upon &s;ome ruinous and de|&s;tructive mea&s;ure, what would they chu&s;e before this very one which we are now of our&s;el|ves &s;o fatally and &s;o madly running upon?</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes &s;aid, that Providence blinds the under|&s;tanding of tho&s;e, whom it de&s;tines to de&s;truction. When things are ripe for that end, men often provoke and ha&s;ten their own fate. But God forbid, that any one being at the helm of this State &s;hould ever not fully and repeatedly con|&s;ider or that he &s;hould from any unhappy impul&s;e &s;cruple or he&s;itate to &s;tay and to &s;top &s;uch mea&s;ures, as may in their con&s;equences make his ma&s;ter to &s;it unea&s;y on his throne nor &s;uffer him him&s;elf to lay down his head upon his pillow without bearing on it the cur&s;es of his country, but which may throw all the parts of the Briti&s;h empire into &s;uch di&s;|order and confu&s;ion, that neither he nor any man &s;hall be able to guide or hold the reins of its government.</P>
<P>I cannot gue&s;s into who&s;e hands the&s;e &s;heets may fall or how they may be received. It is not a Prince alone who may in the&s;e abject times be &s;urrounded with flattery; a Mini&s;ter may not want his &s;hare of it. It is withal but a poor &s;atisfaction for a private per&s;on to wi&s;h in the wa&s;te and havock of his country, that it may be remembered; that there was not wanting One who laid freely and plain|ly before the Public and tho&s;e governing it the ri&s;que and likelihood of the&s;e fatal events and circum&s;tances. But it is to be hoped, that better and more &s;ub&s;tantial effects will follow, &s;hould the&s;e things be truth and rea&s;on, which are
<PB N="41" REF="013582_0039_0F90FC8071E5D1A8">
here advanced. It is at the &s;ame time the furthe&s;t from my meaning, that futurity can be fore&s;een or that it is per|mitted to look into the book of the time to come. There is nothing certain in human affairs. But in incidents of this prodigious importance, in the fate of &s;tates and of kingdoms, in dangers of this tran&s;cendent magni|tude, probability takes the place of certainty and every pru|dent ruler ought to &s;hun and avoid the one with almo&s;t as much caution as he would the other, nor can I fini&s;h this &s;ubject without once more repeating that our pre&s;ent debt puts us its into a &s;ituation, in which no nation ever was before.</P>
<P>I know that &s;ome people affect to magnify the debts of France, but they are hardly worthy &s;peaking of in compari|&s;on of ours. I don't believe, that they exceeded at the utmo&s;t fifteen millions &s;terling when the Regent Duke of Orleans took the method of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi to cancel and annihilate them. The wants of Lewis the Fourteenth had been great, but his credit was as &s;mall. What can the pre&s;ent King have contracted &s;ince to be compared to the debt of Great|Britain? Where is the credit? Does any one believe the Dutch concerns of that kind to be equal in France to what they are in England or has France it&s;elf &s;upplied the re&s;t? However I will only ob&s;erve more that the French debt con|&s;i&s;ts in great mea&s;ure of arrears of pen&s;ions, places, po&s;ts and other grants which the &s;ame hand withholds, as conferred; but that our debt was all received in millions &s;terling.</P>
<P>As to what has been &s;aid that great men moving in a public &s;phere are above the rules of right and wrong. He mu&s;t be unworthy to hold the helm of any government, who is &s;o ignorant of the facts and incidents before his time or &s;o blind to tho&s;e about him as not to ob&s;erve and perceive that good and virtuous action, I mean, &s;uch as are really &s;o without the fal&s;e colours of flattery and ob&s;e|quiou&s;ne&s;s, produce in general and national matters their proper and corre&s;pondent effects. We have not indeed be|fore our eyes in that ca&s;e the formalities of a trial and a &s;entence, the Judge in his robes or the apparatus of an execution; but due con&s;equences do from the general and original law given to the world follow a good or evil conduct in public concerns with much more certain|ty, ju&s;tice and impartiality, than they do by the means of municipal laws in private. But I de&s;ire to explain, that it
<PB N="42" REF="013582_0040_0F90FC8124CE5530">
is not the piety of a bigot on his knees or the prayers even of a devout Prince which will &s;tay or turn the general cour&s;e and order of the world. Had that been the ca&s;e our Henry the Sixty would not have fallen in a pri&s;on by the hand of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in nor Charles the Fir&s;t &s;uffered on a &s;caffold by the axe of the executioner nor James the Second have led the latter part of his life in bani&s;hment. The&s;e were all remarkably both devout and unfortunate Princes. I don't at pre&s;ent enter into the con&s;ideration of what re|ward per&s;onal piety will meet with in another place; but it is the public good, a love and regard for that and at|tention to it, a con&s;tant re&s;olution never to take directly or indirectly by the means either of force or of corruption the property of the &s;ubject at will and at plea&s;ure, but to em|ploy the prerogatives and the powers entru&s;ted by the peo|ple only for their welfare and happine&s;s; which are the true trial and touch&s;tone of the conduct of Princes and Mi|ni&s;ters, as &s;uch. The&s;e naturally produce affection, loyalty, fidelity, attachment &amp; &s;upport. But &s;hould any man or num|ber of men be regardle&s;s of the good or condition of others, trample on their rights, lay unju&s;t hands on their proper|ties, treat them rather like the bea&s;ts of the fields than as their fellows and equals, &s;hould they &s;upport them&s;elves herein with the &s;word and a &s;uperiority of power; the great Author of mankind and of their welfare and happi|ne&s;s has &s;o linked and chained together cau&s;es and effects, that the&s;e things will certainly turn to the detriment and di&s;advantage of them and theirs who do them; &s;ometimes by a &s;ilent and hardly ob&s;ervable cour&s;e of things and &s;ometimes with long forbearance and at a great di&s;tance; but &s;ometimes likewi&s;e at the moment and upon the occa|&s;ion, with direct and immediate re&s;i&s;tance and a common confu&s;ion, wherein the authors of the mi&s;chief are them&s;elves involved and wherein they often fall a prey and a &s;acrifice. The ways of Providence and the cour&s;e of futurity are un|&s;earchable; but were any man to pre&s;ume to divine, how ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice and the general morality of the univer&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e operate, it would perhaps be; that Right will &s;trongly unite, cement and combine by a mutual a&s;&s;ociation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance tho&s;e, who &s;hall act under its banners, while Wrong &s;hall naturally and on the con|trary confound and weaken with di&s;union, di&s;&s;ention and
<PB N="43" REF="013582_0041_0F90FC81F623FC40">
di&s;turbances among them&s;elves tho&s;e, by whom it &s;hall have been unhappily adopted. The&s;e are on each &s;ide the &s;uitable and, as it were, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of their own choice; but there appear &s;ome untoward and threat|ening &s;igns, that the Hand of Heaven will on the occa&s;ion be heavy and &s;evere, when woe to the party, which &s;hall abide it.</P>
<P>If any thing can in this ca&s;e enhance the importance of the great &s;take, which we are about to venture, it mu&s;t be a compari&s;on of the very little profit, that we are going to contend for. The Americans are willing and con&s;ent|ing to give us all they have, provided that we will accept it with our right hand, but we are ob&s;tinate to ri&s;k every thing both of theirs and of our own rather than not to take it with our left. Our whole object is on this occa&s;ion no more, than the difference between tho&s;e two propo&s;ition. Our Ame|ricans have now no gold or &s;ilver. It comes all to the mo|ther-country. It would equally do &s;o, did they receive as much again. They keep none for their own currency; they u&s;e them&s;elves paper for that and &s;end us all the other. One would be amazed to think, what men or admini&s;trations can de&s;ire. Cannot we be contented with all and do we in&s;i&s;t on having more than all?</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid we want to tax them. I a&s;k why? It mu&s;t be an&s;wered, becau&s;e we are bent upon getting their money. I repeat again, we have it already. But &s;ays a ways and means man; we mu&s;t have it in the &s;hape of taxes. No other will &s;erve our purpo&s;e. I reply once more, that we have it really in that &s;hape; for cannot we and don't we tax it when it comes hither and is not that the &s;ame thing? Are there not taxes enough to take it, as &s;oon as it gets to Britain or why don't you a&s;k for more if there are not? Who &s;ay you nay here? I will be bold to &s;ay, that there is at this time rai&s;ed on Great-Britain nothing le&s;s than ten millions &s;terling a year, be&s;ides the collection; which it need not be &s;aid is a very con&s;iderable &s;um more. Our &s;pecie has never been u&s;ed to be reckoned at above twenty millions. It is &s;aid, that about three millions and a quarter of guineas have on occa&s;ion of the light gold been brought into the Bank. Let our currency be calcu|lated on that ground and we &s;hall according to any ju&s;t rea|&s;oning thereon appear to rai&s;e within the year by taxes,
<PB N="44" REF="013582_0042_0F90FC82A2248A20">
including the collection, a &s;um at lea&s;t equal to half of the whole &s;pecie and current coin of the kingdom; a prodigi|ous proportion and perhaps incredible, were we not to exa|mine into particulars.</P>
<P>Should it be &s;aid, that a circulating guinea cannot but pay twenty different taxes in a year, &s;ome might po&s;&s;ibly be at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;urprized at it. But how far &s;hort will that on a more minute examination be found of the truth? Let us con&s;ider only the cour&s;e of a &s;hilling for a very &s;hort time. A chairman pays out of it for his pot of porter. How many taxes does that include; the new and old taxes on beer and malt and the tax on hops? They are more than I have time to reckon. His wife &s;ends next morning to the &s;hop for her tea and &s;ugar. How many more are there? I will leave them to be counted by tho&s;e better acquainted with the book of rates, than I am. But here are a con&s;i|derable number gone through out of one &s;ingle &s;hilling by the time, that a porter has got his beer over night and his wife her breakfa&s;t the next morning. There remains then a third part of the money to run the gauntlet again in the &s;er|vice of the man at dinner time. However they do not per|haps amount quite to twenty; but &s;o is likewi&s;e the time a good deal &s;hort of a year and the money much le&s;s than a guinea. But this is not taking the matter in the &s;tronge&s;t light. There is a chain and union of taxes, which operate in&s;en&s;ibly and almo&s;t beyond imagination. Go into a Shoe|maker's &s;hop. Buy a pair of &s;hoes there. How many taxes does any one in effect pay then? The Journeyman Shoe|maker mu&s;t put into his day's labour and con&s;equently there mu&s;t be laid upon the &s;hoes made by him all the taxes, which he and his family pay in the mean time for his &s;alt, for his &s;oap, for his coals, for his candles, for the linen and for the very &s;hoes worn by him, his wife and his children and for very many other things. The&s;e are all ju&s;t &s;o much money out of his pocket and he mu&s;t be repaid them-by his daily labour, which is his only means. He cannot other|wi&s;e live; there would be no &s;hoes and men mu&s;t go with|out them. But it is not the immediate taxes of the Shoe|maker only which go upon his manufacture, but tho&s;e like|wi&s;e of his trade&s;men. The price of his clothes is enhan|ced by the taxes, which the Taylor and the Weaver paid while they were making and weaving them; however not
<PB N="45" REF="013582_0043_0F90FC837966A420">
by theirs only, but by tho&s;e likewi&s;e of the per&s;ons work|ing for them in their turn and &s;o on. The&s;e mu&s;t all be put on the &s;hoes. In&s;omuch that the whole fully pur&s;u|ed and ob&s;erved makes a &s;eries and combination fit to put Newton or Demoivre at a &s;tand. A poor guinea or &s;hilling cannot in England put its head, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, out of any man's pocket, but that an army of the&s;e catch|poles are ready to &s;eize upon it, wherever it &s;tirs. The matter being then viewed in the&s;e lights, it &s;eems no longer &s;trange, if we rai&s;e a revenue equal to the half of our cur|rency or more. This is a prodigious operation and &s;urely &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy any admini&s;tration what&s;oever. Let us therefore content our&s;elves with getting hither the Ameri|can money. That is our bu&s;ine&s;s. We know what to do with it here. This is the very land of taxes. It is now coming on as fa&s;t, as it can. Don't let us move Heaven and Earth only to di&s;turb it in its pa&s;&s;age. Let us have the lea&s;t patience and fall to work upon it at home. We are certain, that it will be here and that it will then be taxed, and as it were, taxed upon taxed. The re&s;t is with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to my &s;uperiors no better at the bottom, than a childi&s;h fancy and impatience and owing only to the want of a full reflection and con&s;ideration on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I have yet &s;omething to add on this head; which is, that were the Iri&s;h and the Americans both of them una|nimou&s;ly to cry out to us to &s;pare their lives and to take all they have; to beg of us to &s;end them &s;uch another army of taxgatherers, as our own, and with them a copy of our code of revenue laws; I will be bold to &s;ay, that it would neverthele&s;s be in us the wor&s;t policy in the world and totally contrary to our own intere&s;t to take them at their words and to do in the lea&s;t degree any &s;uch thing. We &s;ee the Thames flowing con&s;tantly into the ocean and yet always full. It need not be &s;aid, that the rain and the dew are the cau&s;es of this, which fir&s;t fall and fertilize the earth and then repleni&s;h that noble river. Were tho&s;e two &s;topped or dried up, it would not be long, before we &s;hould pa&s;s over dry &s;hod at London Bridge. Were they &s;o only in part, the &s;tream would then likewi&s;e lower in proportion. What our whole debt to foreigners amounts to, no one may probably know with exactne&s;s; but the more it has been enquired into the higher it has alwyas appeared.
<PB N="46" REF="013582_0044_0F90FC84DB086518">
However the intere&s;t of it is a current, which runs perpe|tually into the Continent. We do not indeed &s;ee it with our eyes, as we do the Thames; otherwi&s;e we love money &s;o much better than we do water, that we might perhaps be le&s;s indifferent about it than we are. It pa&s;&s;es im|perceptibly, but neverthele&s;s &s;urely and without cea&s;ing. What are then the cau&s;es which &s;upply it? I an&s;wer tho&s;e two great &s;ources of Ireland &amp; America. The&s;e fir&s;t water and fructify with their mo&s;t benignant current the whole i&s;land of Great-Britain and then fini&s;h their cour&s;e in the di&s;charge of our debt abroad. Their way is no more vi|&s;ible than that of the intere&s;t it&s;elf of our debt, but it is alike certain and con&s;tant. Stop or dry up the&s;e and you will as &s;urely &s;top or dry up the funds of our debts, as withholding the rain or the dew of Heaven would le&s;&s;en and lower the &s;tream of the river Thames. Taxes will do this. They are the bane of commerce and of agriculture. They affect the Merchant, the Manufacturer, the Planter, the Farmer and the Labourer. Our America is not of an age to &s;upport their operation. The things from above keep their cour&s;e in &s;pite of man for his benefit and advan|tage. It is God's very great mercy that the dew and the rain do not depend on Admini&s;trations, they would other|wi&s;e have undoubtedly been taxed and dried long ago. But it is not &s;o, with what is of our own fabrick or production. We have a great power over riches and trea&s;ure. Govern|ments can effectually cut off the wells &amp; the &s;prings of the&s;e. We have only to look a broad in the world to be abundantly convinced of that truth. The example of Great Britain will not prove the contrary. It was when and while we were not taxed, as we now are, that we pro&s;pered, grew great and rich. Tho&s;e times gave us &s;trength to bear for a while the burden &s;ince impo&s;ed upon us. It is from the Revolution, that our prodigious taxes have begun. They were laid by degrees and &s;o mu&s;t their effects be perceived. They don't operate like a &s;torm or a whirlwind. Let us give them a fair and full trial before we declare, that we are not undone by them. It will then be time enough to make our&s;elves a model for others. I a&s;k, whether it is not our own actual difficulties brought on by the&s;e very taxes, which do now at this in&s;tant urge us upon our colo|nies and which are the cau&s;e of all the pre&s;ent conte&s;t and
<PB N="47" REF="013582_0045_0F90FC8500C2DEB8">
di&s;order. It is one of the fir&s;t principles in commerce not to burthen the means and materials of manufactures. It would be nipping the fruit in the bud. The &s;ame rea&s;on|ing holds here. Let us keep our hands from the&s;e two great cau&s;es and &s;ources of our trea&s;ure and wealth. They have hitherto wonderfully &s;upplied and &s;upported us. They may continue &s;o to do, if we will &s;uffer them.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, that we have at home great and pro|fitable manufactures and our woolen one in particular; whereby we &s;tand le&s;s in need of di&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tance. That is very true; but &s;o is it likewi&s;e, that we have on the con|tinent very many expences and demands for money be&s;ides the intere&s;t of our debt. We &s;hall be very fortunate, if we can with the means of all our riche&s;t re&s;ources make at the year's end an even accompt.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, what are we then to do? We are pre&s;&s;ed with our dome&s;tic burthens and incumbrances. The&s;e put us fir&s;t on the mea&s;ure of Stamps in America, wherein we did not &s;ucceed. The&s;e induced us afterwards to make demands on the India Company, wherein we had rather better fortune. It is the&s;e, which have again bro't us back to our attack on America. How are we either to &s;tand under them or to march forwards? Is it &s;afe to re&s;t as we are? What cour&s;e are we to take if it is not? This is perhaps as &s;erious a propo&s;ition, as one Engli&s;hman can put to another. No man laments more than the writer of the&s;e &s;heets, that twelve years of peace are now elap&s;|ed without any thing being done, without any e&s;tabli&s;h|ment being made, which may enable us to maintain another war or perhaps even in peace &s;upport long the pre&s;ent very heavy pre&s;&s;ure under which we labour. We are in the mean time daily liable to be engaged in war. We have now had an uncommon interval of peace. It was but a very few years ago, that we were on the brink of a rupture with Spain, which would undoubtedly have been attended by one with France. How can any mini&s;ter &s;leep in peace, who has on his hands the care of a great government and the welfare of many millions of people, while public affairs are in a condition &s;o very unprepared for an events, which may at any moment happen and which may in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation bring with it con&s;equences of an importance hard|ly to be conceived? Surely they think on the&s;e things
<PB N="48" REF="013582_0046_0F90FC85A655C050">
who&s;e duty mo&s;t demands it of them. It is impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch concerns of ours can be left only to chance and hazard or as it were, to the fortuitous concour&s;e of atoms. One would think there could hardly be a man in Britain, Mi|ni&s;ter or any other not perpetually employed at the plough, but who mu&s;t daily revolve in his mind the pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances of his country, our burthens, our debts and our expences and at the &s;ame time ca&s;t in his own brea&s;t, what mu&s;t be the be&s;t means of our &s;upporting our&s;elves under them, whether in war or in peace. There is an i&s;&s;ue, which &s;ome men have in view and which I will not expre&s;s, we may be a&s;&s;ured however that they do but very &s;uperfi|cially con&s;ider the matter, who imagine that this will in our ca&s;e take place without the utter ruin and confu&s;ion of every thing. All is notwith&s;tanding as yet tranquility and &s;un&s;hine with us. We po&s;&s;e&s;s a great and fine country; we have mo&s;t noble and beneficial dependencies; we have a fleet; we have an army; we have &s;everal hundred thou|&s;ands and perhaps near a million of men capable of bear|ing arms in their own defence; we have a revenue with a &s;urplus above the intere&s;t of our debts and expences. Surely there is yet an opportunity to find &s;ome plan; to &s;ettle &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment, whereon things may re&s;t &s;afely and &s;e|curely and the Public and all rea&s;onable per&s;ons be &s;atis|fied, that they do &s;o. There is however to time to be lo&s;t. It may be too late to prepare, as it were, in the day of bat|tle and at the moment when our difficulties pre&s;s &s;trongly upon us. But this is of it&s;elf a very wide field and one of the greate&s;t of con&s;iderations nor is it my immediate &s;ubject. But the mea&s;ures now carrying on will not effect it or any thing towards it. No &s;urrounding dangers or difficulties are a good rea&s;on for running down a precipice; our fate can but leads us thither at la&s;t. However no other end can happen to us from the way, which we are now in, if we per&s;evere and proceed in it.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer to the point before us. However I will not &s;o turn my back on this que&s;tion, as not freely and frankly to propo&s;e, what, I tru&s;t, will at lea&s;t be more effectual for our purpo&s;e, as well as more ea|&s;ily carried into execution, than what we are now driving at. I mean to do almo&s;t directly the contrary of what we are about, that is to give a greater liberty and latitude of
<PB N="49" REF="013582_0047_0F90FC890D025A50">
trade both to Ireland and to America, to America including our We&s;t-India I&s;lands. That is my propo&s;ition. We are the &s;eat and center of Government. This is our &s;trength. This is our advantage. This is what we are to pre&s;erve. While we retain this all the money riches and trea&s;ure of the more di&s;tant and dependent parts of our Empire cannot fail to flow in upon us. We have nothing to do with little jealou&s;ies about this trade or that manufacture; it is the proper bu|&s;ine&s;s of the rich to &s;pend their money and of the poor to earn it; the State may well, without meddling in it, leave them to &s;ettle the means of that matter with one another. The end of all trades and of all manufactures mu&s;t re&s;t with us, while we continue the &s;eat of dominion. It is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of giving the tone and the law. Am|bition, plea&s;ure, fa&s;hion, bu&s;ine&s;s, curio&s;ity, education, trade and commerce po&s;ts and places po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed abroad by Engli&s;h|men and numberle&s;s other cau&s;es will contribute to and ef|fect it. The i&s;land of Jamaica and our other i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies what money and commodities equivalent to money have they &s;ent to England, could the whole be ad|ded together? Had they in the time acquired ten times as much, it would all have run the &s;ame road. The climate would have driven the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from thence, while the &s;eat of empire would have invited them hither. Do not we &s;ee the very Proprietaries of our northern colonies living in England as private gentlemen and have not we &s;ometimes known them voting in Minorities of our Lower Hou&s;e of Legi&s;lature, while they might have been almo&s;t as Princes and Kings in their own governments? Were it in the next month to rain over the different parts of Ireland a million of money, how long does any one imagine it would be, before at lea&s;t nine hundred thou&s;and pounds of it would find its way into England? Have we lately wanted very &s;ufficient proofs, that there remains no abundance of ca&s;h in that kingdom? I will not repeat, what has been &s;aid of North-America; but they have by their paper money in|vented the very contrivance of the world for &s;ending to us every ounce of their gold and &s;ilver, did we but know when to be content. Look at the city of London; they neither plant nor do they &s;aw nor do they reap yet Solomon or his Jeru&s;alem were not in all their glory rich and great like that capital of our dominions. The money of our whole
<PB N="50" REF="013582_0048_0F90FC8A81F2F660">
empire is remitted thither, as the blood runs to the heart. Our great body politic is pre&s;erved and nouri&s;hed by the di&s;per&s;ion and circulation of it again from thence. This is the con&s;tant and never-failing cour&s;e of things. But the ca&s;e is much more &s;trong, if we take Great-Britain it&s;elf, whereof London is only a part. That would retain a con|&s;iderable &s;hare of what it receives, did not the intere&s;t of our debt carry it out, as fa&s;t as it comes in. This is the i&s;&s;ue and the drain, which prevents us from perceiving our&s;elves more enriched and repleni&s;hed from the va&s;t quantity of trea&s;ure perpetually arriving to us from many parts. This may perhaps be the rea&s;on, why we are le&s;s &s;en&s;ible, le&s;s attentive and perhaps &s;ometimes le&s;s grateful on the occa|&s;ion. But that is all our own fault, our own doing. We have none to thank for it but our&s;elves. We ought not on that account to e&s;teem the&s;e &s;upplies the le&s;s, for had we not them, it would be much wor&s;e with us. Nothing could follow but our la&s;t decea&s;e and di&s;&s;olution, as a State. The&s;e mu&s;t and will take place, whenever the others &s;hall &s;top. However the&s;e things don't require much rea&s;oning. We have the world before us for an example. Such are every where the effects between the center and other parts of a Government, although perhaps in no ca&s;e more &s;o than in that of Great-Britain on account of certain circum&s;tances and cau&s;es attending that empire, which are particularly &s;uited to produce them. This is our point, if we are but &s;en&s;ible of our true intere&s;t; let us but pre&s;erve this our great and &s;acred prerogative, the other benefits and ad|vantages will of cour&s;e follow, even while we are a&s;leep.</P>
<P>I &s;hall u&s;e no words to prove that this arangement will bring a greater influx of trea&s;ure to tho&s;e, to who&s;e liberty of trade it &s;hall extend. The per&s;on the mo&s;t prejudiced or the mo&s;t &s;hort-&s;ighted in the ca&s;e will not di&s;pute that with me. I will venture to pre&s;ume on that point. This will therefore attach to us our dependencies at the &s;ame time, that it enriches us our&s;elves. It will &s;trengthen and fa&s;ten the bond and union between us. It will confirm our &s;u|periority while it encrea&s;es the fruits of it. It will bring us more &s;poils and profits than conque&s;t, although it will o|perate by love and affection. It will require neither fleets or armies to enforce it; we need fear no revolts, no defecti|ons or confederacies on the account of it. How happy
<PB N="51" REF="013582_0049_0F90FC8BA616E290">
would it be, if all the circum&s;tances of the other plan would in the &s;ame manner an&s;wer and play into the hands of each other! When will men be contented to do to others no more mi&s;chief, than what will turn to their own benefit? States and mini&s;ters will have advanced no mean way in policy as well as in morality, when they &s;hall once have learned to confine all their evil towards others within that circle. It is the very perver&s;ene&s;s of folly to &s;uppo&s;e, that men can &s;erve them&s;elves only by oppre&s;&s;ing others. But here on the contrary the hand of nature it&s;elf works with us. Freedom of trade is our foundation; no wonder then that &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings coincide together. There is open before us a rich and wide field; we have only to enter and to reap the harve&s;t, which is ripe and plentiful. This propo&s;al re&s;ts therefore on three points; to wit, that it will bring a greater influx to trea&s;ure into our outward dominions; that this mu&s;t enrich the center of empire; which cannot therefore likewi&s;e but encrea&s;e its revenue. The&s;e are &s;hort propo&s;itions and no way perplexed. Let them be well examined. All falls to the ground, which has been &s;aid on the &s;ubject, if any one of them be fal&s;e or mi&s;taken; but &s;hould they on the contrary be all of them mo&s;t evident, mo&s;t certain and indi&s;putable, let any man and the greate&s;t in tru&s;t the mo&s;t con&s;ider; how he can an&s;wer to Ireland, to the Colonies, to his Country at home, to his King him&s;elf in the concern of his Revenue and his Ex|chequer, the refu&s;ing his attention &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a mea&s;ure, &s;o very practicable and at the &s;ame time &s;o univer&s;ally be|neficial and &s;alutary.</P>
<P>This is the more and much more nece&s;&s;ary on account of the pre&s;ent condition of Ireland. The late enquiry con|cerning their linnen manufacture, the public hi&s;tory of their emigrations and the &s;tate of their credit at the beginning of the pre&s;ent Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament have made that &s;uffi|ciently known. I &s;hall not pretend to de&s;cribe it. Eng|land has perhaps from the I&s;land reaped more real benefit, than Spain ever did from Mexico or Peru Spain gains indeed from tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions great riches of &s;ilver and gold; but &s;he has dearly purcha&s;ed them at the price of her in|habitants and people at home. Whereas Ireland affords us in many ways a very advantageous a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;up|port of men, while we receive from her at the &s;ame time a
<PB N="52" REF="013582_0050_0F90FC8C68DFD248">
con&s;tant mo&s;t rich influx and &s;upply of money. We now &s;o depend on the&s;e things and can &s;o ill do without them and are by the&s;e means &s;o united with our Si&s;ter I&s;land, that &s;hould &s;he on any account unhappily &s;ink, &s;he cannot but like a mill &s;tone fa&s;tened about our necks carry us down along with her. Should her condition grow wor&s;e, who knows but it may turn to rage and de&s;pair and either have an effect on her Legi&s;lature or that the majority thereof may be hardly able to manage and govern their own State. I am unwilling to point out &s;uch po&s;&s;ibilities; but it will not be long health and wealth in England, &s;hould any irre|trievable mi&s;chief happen in Ireland. A moderate remedy might however now be timely for what may in futurity be beyond redre&s;s. A greater liberty and latitude of trade is the proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the ca&s;e. It is what Ireland it&s;elf wi&s;hes and de&s;ires. It will at the &s;ame time be of more be|nefit to us than to them. France is beating us out of the trades of Turkey, of Spain &amp; even of Portugal. Let but loo&s;e the Iri&s;h and they will do as much for them and likewi&s;e for &s;ome others. It is Great-Britain which witholds the hand of Ireland and not the nature of things, that confines it. Let us but con&s;ent and they will &s;oon &s;tretch out their right hand into many a market in the world, where it now never appears and having done &s;o they will immediately pay to us with their left the money gained there, as &s;urely, at that we are born Engli&s;hmen. I don't point out parti|culars; lights will not be wanting in that re&s;pect, when|ever there &s;hall be an inclination to demand them. I don't moreover mean to &s;ignify, that any opening of the com|merce of Ireland and America recommended within the compa&s;s of the&s;e &s;heets will of it&s;elf be adequate to all the demands of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. That will in all ap|pearance require a new and univer&s;al arangement of our taxes and commerce, wherein Great-Britain her&s;elf mu&s;t bear a mo&s;t material part. No man can &s;ay, that all the money in Europe is equal to our National Debt nor can therefore any provi&s;ion be &s;ufficient, but what may produce effects an&s;werable to &s;uch a very great nece&s;&s;ity. Some plan &s;eems to be demanded which may bring into Great|Britain a good part of all the gold and &s;ilver now current in the world. Nothing le&s;s will perhaps do our bu&s;ine&s;s. The practicability of this cannot but appear a doubtful
<PB N="53" REF="013582_0051_0F90FC8D2E65BF20">
problem. Were all &s;tates what&s;oever formed on a con&s;ti|tution the mo&s;t advantageous for commerce, whereof each is capable, it is evident, that they would then &s;hare among them tho&s;e two precious metals in &s;o near a proportion, that no one could therein have over the re&s;t any very great &s;upe|riority. But this is exceedingly wide of the ca&s;e. No one &s;tate is &s;o con&s;tituted; but on the contrary almo&s;t all go|vernments whatever are framed and act on principles di|rectly oppo&s;ite thereto. This gives a very great opportu|nity for an extreme difference and di&s;proportion in that re&s;pect. It is perhaps on the availing our&s;elves thereof, that depends the future welfare of our country and the &s;afety, the &s;tability and the very &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of our &s;tate. The Dutch are a &s;mall people or at lea&s;t have but a very confined territory and that defended with difficulty from the &s;ea. They have neverthele&s;s done a great deal in the way, which we are &s;peaking of. They are certainly there|in at the head of all mankind. However it is evident and might be ea&s;ily pointed out, that they are yet far &s;hort of perfection. There is good room for others to go beyond and e&s;pecially for a &s;tate which has &s;uch advantages as Great-Britain. However what degree of advantage the nature of things will admit of on this head or how to at|tain thereto are not que&s;tions of this pre&s;ent in&s;tant. I have &s;aid thus much led to it by my &s;ubject together with the intere&s;t of the Public therein and the nece&s;&s;ity, which I am per&s;uaded that my country is at this time under of finding and carrying into execution &s;ome great, general and &s;alutary mea&s;ure. Happy will be the hand that &s;hall in the fir&s;t place prevent the ruin, whereon we are now run|ning. We mu&s;t begin there. That is the object directly before us. Let us next enlarge the trade of Ireland and America. This will do a great deal. It may lead us to|wards a more univer&s;al plan, with which it cannot at the &s;ame time but coincide. It will withal be well, that this double benefit of the&s;e two parts of our country went hand in hand together. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of Ireland makes it ab&s;olutely and immediately nece&s;&s;ary for the one and the intere&s;t of Great-Britain requires it for both.</P>
<P>I don't enter into particulars concerning the &s;topping up the Port of Bo&s;ton or the new laws given to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay. However I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the alteration of their
<PB N="54" REF="013582_0052_0F90FC8DE7746338">
Charter and of their Civil Government is not temporary like the other provi&s;ions, but perpetnal. The breaking of Charters is making the wor&s;t war upon mankind. It in|volves the innocent and tho&s;e yet unborn. Every thing de|pends with men on their con&s;titution of government. Such a mea&s;ure is therefore wantonly laying wa&s;te the territories of the earth and I &s;peak it with reverence, but it is even forbidding Providence it&s;elf to make mankind happy there|on, unle&s;s he &s;hall for the undoing the works of unrea&s;ona|ble and ill judging men perform immediate miracles and &s;u&s;pend or counteract his own laws of nature, which is &s;ure|ly not to be &s;uppo&s;ed or expected. As for tho&s;e, who re|fu&s;e or impede law and ju&s;tice for blood, let them be well aware, that they don't thereby bring it on their own heads or warrant private men to be them&s;elves their own aven|gers. However the whole will no doubt be received in A|merica as a declaration of war and depend upon the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue. It mu&s;t be by force and conque&s;t if they &s;ubmit. It is probably not a month or a year, that will finally deter|mine this affair. The flame may break out immediately or the fire may &s;mother until &s;ome fatal opportunity of our being engaged in a foreign war or &s;ome other &s;uch occa&s;ion. The authors of the&s;e mea&s;ures no doubt expect that the re|moval of the Cu&s;tomhou&s;e and the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the trade of Bo&s;ton will bring the&s;e people on their knees and force them to &s;ubmit to the re&s;t of our mea&s;ures. It is evident, that this is their idea. They might have been well infor|med and in&s;tructed and ought to have been &s;o before they proceeded &s;o far. They may neverthele&s;s find them&s;elves much mi&s;taken in the event, however forward they are to hazard on their opinion the welfare and pro&s;perity of their country. It is no wonder, that &s;ome men cannot even at the di&s;tance of America bear a Democratical Con&s;titution. But they ought to know the Hi&s;tory of the World better than to be ignorant of the &s;trength and the force of &s;uch a form of government and how &s;trenuou&s;ly and almo&s;t won|derfully people living under one have &s;ometimes exerted them&s;elves in defence of their rights and liberties and how fatally it has ended with many a man and many a &s;tate who have entered into quarrels, wars and conte&s;ts with them.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay, that all the contradiction and oppo&s;ition of America originates from home and that it is only the fac|tion

of England, which catches there. Nothing perhaps te&s;tifies a greater ignorance of the true &s;tate of that country, than &s;uch a notion. What is all the &s;pirit of Patrioti&s;m or of Liberty now left in England, more than the la&s;t &s;nuff of an expiring lamp? It is not longer than three and thirty years ago, that it was otherwi&s;e with us. But who can &s;ay whether the &s;ame flame, the &s;ame &s;acred flame may not at this time burn brightly and &s;trongly in America, which once &s;how'd forth &s;uch wonders in Greece and in Rome and from who&s;e a&s;hes it &s;till enlightens a great part of mankind, I mean, all who are not &s;unk in ignorance or barbarity. They have certainly there excellent and free forms of go|vernment and which partake perhaps in &s;ome degree of the principles, whereon were framed the ancient ones of tho&s;e eminent cities. They are them&s;elves as yet a new and un|corrupted people. They carried with them formerly the &s;pirit of Liberty from England, at the time that it was in its greate&s;t purity and perfection there, nor has it &s;ince de|generated by the climate. Whoever &s;hall judge of their temper by that at home and proceed accordingly, will per|haps in the end be &s;corched by that flame, which he may find to burn too powerfully for him and of the nature and of the means to extingui&s;h which, he was totally ignorant.</P>
<P>I have now con&s;idered the rectitude, the practicability and the profit to be expected from our pre&s;ent mea&s;ures and have gone &s;o far as to offer another mea&s;ure in&s;tead. I hope, that I have proved my propo&s;itions to a great degree of clearne&s;s and certainty. I don't know what to do more on this &s;ubject unle&s;s I &s;hould propo&s;e &s;omething, which might convince and &s;atisfy without the trouble of rea&s;on and argument. This &s;eems difficult. However I will not de&s;pair. Let me be permitted to try my hand in the ca&s;e. I will recommend and, &s;o far as becomes me, de&s;ire and re|que&s;t, that every one when he con&s;iders of this &s;ubject and e&s;pecially before he u&s;es any hard words or pa&s;&s;es any har&s;h laws, will place him&s;elf in America; will imagine him&s;elf born, bred, re&s;ident and having all his concerns and fortune there. I don't mean in the light of a Governor or of one, who &s;eeks to recommend and to advance him&s;elf here at the expence of his countrymen in that part of the world; but as one, who has no other views or intere&s;t except in the common good of his colony or continent. Let then any

&s;uch man candidly and fairly a&s;k him&s;elf in his own brea&s;t, what he &s;hould in that &s;ituation think of being taxed at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and let no man on this occa&s;ion throw a &s;tone, who&s;e heart does not plainly and roundly an&s;wer him with its a&s;&s;ent. I may make too free with Mini&s;ters of State; but I would particularly pre&s;s this on tho&s;e, who&s;e de&s;ires, pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations are followed by effects and who hold perhaps at this moment in their hands the fate of Great Britain and of North America. This I &s;ay, is a pro|po&s;ition without a &s;yllogi&s;m; but which if properly brought home and enforced by every man upon him&s;elf, may per|haps penetrate move and &s;often more than all the argu|ments and earne&s;tne&s;s, which I have hitherto u&s;ed.</P>
<P>I would willingly try this experiment of tran&s;po&s;ition upon a late tran&s;action, wherein &s;ome peoples opinion &s;eem to be affected by locality. Certain letters (&s;ee letters of Governor Hutchin&s;on, &amp;c.) have been publi&s;hed of an Ame|rican Governor and Lieutenant Governor and a third per|&s;on together with remarks and the &s;peech of a learned and ingenious Gentleman. They are offered as an appeal to the public again&s;t the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay. The&s;e cannot therefore, but be them&s;elves likewi&s;e the objects of a public con&s;ideration. I have by the touch&s;tone of locality a mind to examine and que&s;tion &s;ome of this learned gen|tleman's rea&s;oning. It is now but between eighty and nine|ty years, &s;ince we of this country bani&s;hed our King. On what ground did we do it?&mdash;It will be an&s;wered; that we did not like his actions; for that they tended to deprive us of our be&s;t rights and properties. That we did it as Eng|li&s;hmen on the Con&s;titution of England&mdash;Who was the com|mon Judge between us and him?&mdash;There was no &s;uch com|mon Judge. We judged for our&s;elves. He was our King, our Magi&s;trate, our Tru&s;tee. When we found him to fail in the e&s;&s;ential points of the&s;e offices, we took another. This was our right as Engli&s;hmen&mdash;But we &s;et a&s;ide one of his daughters from her turn in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and ap|pointed in&s;tead a per&s;on, who had no title by birth. The Kings hor&s;e threw him and the Lady &s;ucceeded. But that was chance. It might in a cour&s;e of nature very well have happened, that &s;he had never been Queen. What had &s;he done?&mdash;She had taken a remarkable part in the Revoluti|on and was totally unexceptionable. But there were in
<PB N="57" REF="013582_0055_0F90FC9093A85558">
one &s;cale the welfare and happine&s;s of many millions of people and in the other the advancement of only one Lady, although a de&s;erving one. There was therefore no equa|lity, the latter could not but kick the beam&mdash;I an&s;wer, that I &s;ub&s;cribe to this with my hand and my heart. But this is one fide of the medal. Let us turn the rever&s;e. An American Governor is not &s;o big as a King; he don't wear a Crown nor bear a Sceptre nor fit on a Throne nor is wor|&s;hipped on the knee nor has a Navy nor an Army nor makes Bi&s;hops nor Judges nor is his Civil Li&s;t perhaps above a thou&s;and pounds a year. He &s;eems to be much more re&s;|pon&s;ible and more removable, than a King. Suppo&s;e then that one of our Colonies &s;hould take the &s;tronge&s;t exceptions to their Governor and de&s;ire to change him; would they in that ca&s;e be permitted to judge for them&s;elves?&mdash;No, Why not?&mdash;Becau&s;e they are Americans. Who are to judge for them?&mdash;We. Why &s;o?&mdash;Becau&s;e we are Eng|ligmen.&mdash;But would their application be to us a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for a removal?&mdash;Perhaps not; but on the contrary a rea&s;on to continue him at pre&s;ent and to promote and ad|vance him afterwards. That has been the ca&s;e before and may probably be &s;o again&mdash;But why is the mea&s;ure which we mete to them &s;o different from that, which we mea&s;ure to our&s;elves?&mdash;Becau&s;e we are Engli&s;hmen and they are Americans.&mdash;This mu&s;t be owned to be perfectly ju&s;t and &s;atisfactory and the Americans are the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable men in the world, if they don't &s;ee it exactly in the &s;ame light.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e that the Repre&s;entative Body of the Province &s;hould make the complaint?&mdash;The an&s;wer would then be, that there was no accu&s;er or if any one cho&s;e to &s;peak Latin no <HI>delator.</HI>&mdash;Suppo&s;e that they complain of fal&s;ehood and treachery towards the Province?&mdash;That would be no charge, no <HI>crimen.</HI>&mdash;Suppo&s;e that they gave in evidence the party's own letters?&mdash;That would compleat the thing; for there would then be no evidence, no <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tis</HI>&mdash;But will this hold water?&mdash;Admirably; with re&s;pect to America and in Latin.</P>
<P>It is &s;trongly di&s;puted, whether the&s;e American letters are of a public or private nature. This may not in it&s;elf be a very important point. However let us endeavour to &s;ettle it &s;ince it lies in our way. Whatever concerns and affects the intere&s;ts, the welfare and happine&s;s of a whole
<PB N="58" REF="013582_0056_0F90FC9116675618">
people is and mu&s;t be of a public nature, whether papers, letters or any other thing what&s;oever. Good and evil are not matters of Law or of Logic. They are the mo&s;t, if not the only e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tances of the world. They are what every thing el&s;e refers to. They &s;tamp an eter|nal mark and difference on all things which even imagina|tion cannot cancel or era&s;e. The enjoyment of the one and the avoiding of the other is the very end of our being and likewi&s;e of all the beings which do or which even can be &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t and which have a &s;en&s;e and perception of them. Whatever therefore relates to the general good and evil of a People is of a public nature. It is that circum|&s;tance which makes it &s;o. The terms are as good as &s;yno|nimous. Whatever concerns on the contrary only this or that individual is of a private nature. It is confined to his or their happine&s;s or welfare; to his or their good and evil. There is again the true and unerring di&s;tinction. The&s;e things &s;eem clear to the greate&s;t degree of intuitive certainty. It is &s;trange to be forced to rea&s;on about them. However we are told otherwi&s;e. If &s;ome compliments hap|pen in a letter to be made to an old Lady, it changes the e&s;&s;ence of every thing; &s;he contracts and confines the whole matter and all becomes of a private nature; although the chief &s;ubject of that very letter &s;hould be to advi&s;e and point out the means of altering the Charter and of new modelling the Con&s;titution of a Colony and that there &s;hould be recom|mended therein the finding &s;ome way according to its own language "to TAKE OFF the original incendiaries," le&s;t they &s;hould <Q>continue to in&s;till their poi&s;on into the minds of the people;</Q> but the mention of the old Lady makes it all private (&s;ee Mr. Wedderburn's &s;peech page 94 and letter of Mr. A Oliver Feb. 13, 1769) But &s;up|po&s;e that the&s;e letters were really meant and intended to pro|duce public effects; what will that do?&mdash;Nothing at all. If the per&s;on had not at that moment a place, to whom they were written, it &s;ignifies nothing; although he might have had a po&s;t before and might look for one again and although he might have communicated the&s;e letters to others for the very purpo&s;e of affecting the Public. All this will be of no importance, if the per&s;on did not happen to have a place at the time.&mdash;Would not one be tempted to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> that as &s;ome endeavour to leave no property in Ame|rica,

<P>But let us take this matter, in another light&mdash;Suppo&s;e a Prince to have been the &s;ubject of the&s;e letters in&s;tead of a People and his conduct and character to have therein been &s;o freely treated and cen&s;ured in&s;tead of theirs and the di|ve&s;ting him of his power and dignity &s;o plainly mentioned and recommended, in&s;tead of the depriving them of their rights and privileges and the <HI>taking him off</HI> propo&s;ed in&s;tead of the <HI>taking</HI> off &s;ome of them, what would have been the con&s;equence?&mdash;High Trea&s;on&mdash;But might not the&s;e have been private letters of friend&s;hip and the receiver have &s;e|creted and concealed them?&mdash;There is no &s;uch thing as private letters in the ca&s;e. No civilities &s;ent to the faire&s;t Lady in the land can make them &s;o. The per&s;on receiving mu&s;t at his over peril carry them to a Secretary of State or to a Ju&s;tice of the Peace or to &s;ome other Magi&s;trate; we don't otherwi&s;e want a word for him, which is mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on.&mdash;But who would take notice of &s;uch a thing?&mdash;Let Mr. Attorney or Mr. Solicitor an&s;wer that&mdash;But on what ground is all this?&mdash;Becau&s;e the Prince is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the public per&s;on and to repre&s;ent the whole people and that what relates to him may affect them&mdash;But there are bad Princes and writing again&s;t them is &s;ometimes writing in &s;upport and in the intere&s;ts of the Public and of the People&mdash;No &s;uch plea or propo&s;ition is ever &s;uffered.

Say a word again&s;t a Prince and beware of informations, indict|ments, fines, pri&s;ons, &s;caffolds and gibbets.

It is this only that makes many men ea&s;y and indifferent in the ca&s;e about right and wrong ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice. Were my countrymen now in England dipped once in the River Delaware.

He bought &s;ome gunpowder. It is to be believed, that he paid hone&s;tly for it. He could perhaps have produced a receipt for it. He placed it in the cellars or other apart|ments hired by him He had indeed a mind to amu&s;e him|&s;elf with blowing up the Legi&s;lature of Great Britain. He met with his reward. But &s;uppo&s;e that he and Garnet and the re&s;t of their a&s;&s;ociates, in&s;tead of falling into the hands of an Engli&s;h Jury, had been tried at Rome before the Con|&s;i&s;tory Court or any other Court there, they would no doubt have found an advocate. That is no other than the duty of the profe&s;&s;ion. I won't take upon me to &s;ay, whether he would in this ca&s;e have flouri&s;hed about private property, tre&s;pa&s;s or forcible entry; but whatever turn the Italian council had thought proper to give the cau&s;e of his clients, has any one &s;eriou&s;ly the lea&s;t doubt, but that they would have been cleared and acquitted and probably by the Court of Rome it&s;elf in good time preferred and promoted. As it happened, nothing remained for them but the honour of Martyrdom, which however &s;ome of them are &s;aid to have attained. So much can a difference of climate do and &s;uch force have prejudice, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and locality. But Garnet and Fawkes and their friends were fools, Je&s;uits as &s;ome of them were. They did not under|&s;tand their trade. A certain northern Prince of our time and perhaps &s;ome others, have found better ways of blow|ing up Legi&s;latures than with gunpowder; which don't make a quarter of the crack and combu&s;tion, but which are ten times more effectual.</P>

The &s;y|cophants of Mini&s;ters endeavour therefore to throw on the artifice and influence of individuals all di&s;content or di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction of the Public. Mr. Wilkes moves England and Dr. Franklin America; as if we had here no feeling, but through the fir&s;t and they had there neither eyes or ears, but by the latter. It were happy for mankind, if Admi|ni&s;trations procured their own votes and majorities with as much fairne&s;s, as the voice of the People is commonly ob|tained. I wonder, whether we &s;hould then have ever heard of any government in Europe indebted in the &s;um of a hun|dred and forty millions &s;terling or be at this moment under the alarm of a parent &s;tate attacking its own colonies or of a great empire &s;etting at work its fleets and armies only to throw the parts of it&s;elf into mi&s;chief and confu&s;ion.

But the Americans &s;hould con&s;ider, that two different parts of a country may be oppre&s;&s;ed by one and the &s;ame hand. Admini&s;trations have been &s;quandering and running us in debt at home, until our whole &s;ub&s;tance is wa&s;ted and con|&s;umed. It may now be coming to their turn. But <HI>procul a Jove, procul a fulmine.</HI> Great Britain is fir&s;t brought to its extremity. Let any of our dependencies compare their burthens with ours and then complain of the nation, if they &s;hall find that ours are the lighter. I don't mean to make a merit of this; but let them &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame &s;trong hand to be upon us both, when they &s;hall have been con|vinced, how little we are in this re&s;pect to be envied.</P>
<P>I am unwilling to take my leave without &s;aying likewi&s;e one word to my Countrymen of England. It is not only riches and power, men and money, which the centre of go|vernment receives from the detached parts of its domini|ons, but likewi&s;e credit and honor in the world. The Scotch and the Iri&s;h are as good men, as any in Europe. This is well known, wherever they &s;eek &s;ervice and e&s;tab|li&s;hments; and the which they are left to do in more parts, than is for the benefit of Great Britain. Our Countrymen of America have not yet &s;o figured in our Quarter of the globe; but it is hardly a compliment to place them clearly at the head of their own, the offspring of all other people there included. If there are any &s;poil'd children of our national family, it mu&s;t be the Engli&s;h them&s;elves; unle&s;s that riches and luxury mend the manners of men. But neverthele&s;s being &s;o the &s;eat of Empire and all commands i&s;&s;uing from our capital and our name being forward, the actions, the merits, the figure, the reputation and the glory of all our Countrymen what&s;oever and where&s;oever do ex|ceedingly redound to us and to he credit of England and of Engli&s;hmen. In return for the&s;e things they de&s;ire no more than a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e and acknowledgment of them. Whether we do make this return, whether the&s;e circum&s;tances have always the weight with us, which they merit, Engli&s;hmen will be&s;t determine by examining into their own brea&s;ts. But this we may be a&s;&s;ured of; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> good will, affection and attachment of our Countrymen &s;pread throughout our

common Empire will be our firme&s;t &s;trength and &s;ecurity, if it &s;hall be our lot to continue in our pre&s;ent &s;plendor and pro&s;perity; as likewi&s;e that the &s;ame cannot but be our be&s;t &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, wherewith to weather the &s;torms of fate and fortune, if Heaven &s;hall on the contrary have any rever&s;e or times of difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s in &s;tore for us.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed, unle&s;s it may be a few words with re&s;pect to the Author him&s;elf. He hopes, that &s;hould in the warmth of writing any inadvertencies or inaccuracies have fallen from him, that they will be readily overlooked; he is per&s;waded that there are none &s;uch, as affect his argu|ment. He has wrote with freedom, but he tru&s;ts without offence; he has no per&s;onal views what&s;oever in any thing, that he has advanced or offered; he has no intere&s;t in any di&s;tant part of the Briti&s;h Dominions, neither in Scotland, Ireland or America; he has neither trade or traffick with them nor a foot of land in any of them. His concerns, his property, his family, his friend&s;hips his affections, every thing mo&s;t dear to him center in South-Britain. He has no intercour&s;e or connexion with any man, that either is that ever was, or who to the be&s;t of his knowledge de&s;ires to be a Mini&s;ter. He is totally indifferent, who &s;hall be at the head of our affairs, any otherwi&s;e than as the Public may be concerned in it. He would not perhaps in his hum|ble &s;ituation accept of any place or po&s;t, high or low, which the King has to confer great and powerful as he is He wi&s;hes only that the&s;e &s;heets may be read, as they are written, with the pure&s;t and the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted intentions for the good the greatne&s;s and the pro&s;perity of our whole empire, for the union, harmony and pre&s;ervation of all its parts and for the particular intere&s;t, &s;afety, peace, welfare and happine&s;s of England.</P>
