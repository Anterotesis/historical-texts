<HEAD>A FEW POLITICAL REFLECTIONS SUBMITTED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BRITISH COLONIES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>SO loud and important is the pre&s;ent cry for liberty, that it cannot but rou&s;e every man who has the welfare of his country at heart; and it becomes every man's duty to exert him&s;elf on the occa&s;ion. We have, my Brethren, a dangerous &s;lip|pery path to tread: Let us then carefully pick our way, and attentively in&s;pect every road that is point|ed to our view.&mdash;Let us patiently hear and con&s;ider every opinion that is offered with candor. Let us not reject, with contempt, whatever di&s;agrees with our own private &s;entiments. In the multitude of coun&s;el there is wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>THE di&s;pute between Great-Britain and her co|lonies is now reduced to a &s;ingle point.&mdash;<HI>Whether the Parliament &s;hall give laws to America</HI>; a point &s;o unju&s;t, &s;o unnatural and ab&s;urd, that not only every American, but many of the inhabitants of Britain, mu&s;t unite in oppo&s;ing it. In what manner this oppo&s;ition is to be made, becomes a que&s;tion of
<PB N="4" REF="013760_0004_0F91A9BFABAAF098">
the mo&s;t &s;erious nature.&mdash;The <HI>ultima ratio</HI>&mdash;to op|po&s;e force to force, is what the heart of every Ame|rican mu&s;t revolt at; for with whom &s;hould we en|gage?&mdash;Our friends&mdash;our countrymen&mdash;our kindred &mdash; No! let not the ba&s;e profligacy of a Mini&s;try, abandoned to every principle of virtue, and raging for de&s;poti&s;m, tempt &s;uch near and dear connexions to &s;heath the &s;word in each others bowels.&mdash;There are &s;urer, &s;afer means to end the controver&s;y.&mdash;It is with great deference I hazard my opinion with my countrymen; I know I mu&s;t &s;tand or fall with you, and am, in the highe&s;t degree, earne&s;t to have us act with &s;pirit and prudence.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t emotions of anger cannot be &s;uppo&s;|ed always to dictate the be&s;t adapted &s;chemes; for at that time a degree of revenge will ever attend the remedy. Let us be calm, my Brethren; let us confer freely and clo&s;ely together, and let us de|termine, like men of &s;en&s;e, to bear difference in &s;entiments with becoming coolne&s;s. We all mean the &s;ame thing, we all de&s;ire to be extricated from the common danger; and is it to be wondered at, if we view the matter in different points of light.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t re&s;olves from our afflicted Brethren in Bo&s;ton intimate a de&s;ign of &s;u&s;pending all trade with the We&s;t-Indies: Far be it from me to con|demn them for &s;uch a &s;tep, at a time when under the agonizing influence of arbitrary &s;ubjection, with their properties and liberties wre&s;ted from them; but cooler thoughts <HI>mu&s;t</HI> convince men, who have &s;o clear a view of the rights of mankind as <HI>they</HI> have, that puni&s;hments &s;hould only be inflicted where Ju|&s;tice directs. Our Brethren in the I&s;lands are &s;o unfortunately &s;urrounded with natural dome&s;tic ene|mies, that &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, the &s;tronge&s;t principle
<PB N="5" REF="013760_0005_0F91A9C1ECA1A8C0">
nature, prompts them to a kind of acquie&s;cence with acts of Parliament; and their want of inter|nal means of independent &s;upport mu&s;t ever render it prudent for them to oppo&s;e their Mother Coun|try with caution. Their dependance on us for pro|vi&s;ion is &s;o great, that &s;hould it be &s;uddenly with|held, a general famine in the I&s;lands mu&s;t inevitably en&s;ue; for it would be a con&s;iderable time before the Engli&s;h Merchants would throw their trade into that channel: The high price of provi&s;ions in England would deter them from venturing; as al&s;o probably &s;ome doubts might ari&s;e in their minds of our &s;trictly adhering to our re&s;olutions. Thus &s;hould we inflict the &s;evere&s;t of puni&s;hments upon an inno|cent people, that, by <HI>their</HI> &s;ufferings, <HI>we</HI> might find relief.&mdash;No, my Brethren, we are not yet reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of acting unbecoming that &s;pirit of liberty we profe&s;s.&mdash;Some may argue that the I&s;lands have upwards of &s;eventy members in Par|liament; but let us remember they are not cho&s;en by the We&s;t Indians; they only happen to be gen|tlemen that have &s;ugar e&s;tates; and any American gentleman, that choo&s;es to &s;ettle in England, and will not begrudge the knavery and the price, may obtain a &s;eat.</P>
<P>SOME of our neighbours, in Maryland, have ex|tended their views a &s;tep further, and propo&s;e with|holding the monies due to their Merchants in Eng|land: But this, on recon&s;idering the &s;ubject, they will certainly give up. All liberty is founded in ju&s;tice, and I hope every American will &s;purn at the thought of acting beneath the character of men and Chri&s;tians: Let us fir&s;t do &s;trict ju&s;tice to others, and then we can with confidence a&s;&s;ert our own rights. The Merchants of England have entru&s;ted us with their fortunes; they have placed in us the
<PB N="6" REF="013760_0006_0F91A9C3E7A81D68">
mo&s;t unlimited confidence; nay, they are our warme&s;t advocates and friends; &s;hall we then unju&s;t|ly take a &s;tep that would infallibly ruin them? Far be it from us, and I hope the gentlemen of Ma|ryland, who have ha&s;tily adopted this &s;entiment, will readily retract, when they con&s;ider it in all its con&s;equences; among&s;t which the <HI>breach of public mercantile faith</HI> ought not to be e&s;teemed the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>OUR commerce with England being founded on mutual convenience, and voluntary compact, it cer|tainly re&s;ts with us to determine <HI>how far it &s;hall be extended,</HI> and <HI>when it &s;hall cea&s;e</HI>; this is a right which even Lord North, with all his arbitrary views, <HI>dare</HI> not deny. No man can be obliged to purcha&s;e goods of another; the &s;eller can do no more than expo&s;e his wares to public &s;ale, the buyer is to determine <HI>what, when,</HI> and <HI>how much</HI> he will buy; this being the ca&s;e, it becomes now a que&s;tion, <HI>whether this is not the time to make a general exerci&s;e of that power</HI>: As an individual, after having ma|turely weighed the &s;ubject, I give my voice for ex|erting it, in its <HI>fulle&s;t extent.</HI> I would recommend <HI>a general non-importation,</HI> as the mo&s;t effectual means of convincing the people of England of how much importance we are. Their manufacturers will quick|ly feel the &s;tagnation of trade, and remon&s;trate in our behalf to the Legi&s;lature; here is our ground, here let us fight them; 'tis a ground we can main|tain with an hone&s;t con&s;cience, and let us not quit it, till they have di&s;avowed the right of taxing <HI>by whatever name</HI>; and let us not forget to in&s;i&s;t on a repeal of the <HI>Wool bill,</HI> the <HI>Hat bill,</HI> and the <HI>Iron bill,</HI> which are in their nature more obnoxious to liberty than the Revenue acts. Perhaps it may be &s;aid we cannot do without Engli&s;h goods long enough to effect our purpo&s;es; I do a&s;&s;ure you, Bre|thren,
<PB N="7" REF="013760_0007_0F91A9C50FA7C830">
it is mo&s;t certainly a mi&s;taken opinion; if we can but determine to throw by our luxuries, nor ca&s;t off our clothes till they are ready to fall from our backs, we have &s;tock &s;ufficient to la&s;t for years to come. Let every patch on our garments &s;tand as a proof of our patrioti&s;m, and <HI>let no man be a&s;hamed of an old coat.</HI> But as in the effecting &s;o de&s;irable a purpo&s;e, the burthen will fall particularly heavy on the Importers and Retailers, many of whom have no other way of &s;upporting their families, I would re|commend an earne&s;t attention to <HI>their</HI> &s;ituation; for it would be the highe&s;t inju&s;tice to require <HI>them</HI> to fall a &s;acrifice to the general cau&s;e:&mdash;'Tis through them we are to conquer&mdash;then let us not doom <HI>them</HI> the unhappy victims, to &s;pring the mine, that <HI>we</HI> may enter the citadel. The pre&s;ent tax demanded of us is &s;o trifling, that, for the mere <HI>quantum,</HI> it might not be an object of our attention; but all the horrid train of Parliamentary impo&s;itions, which would certainly follow, mu&s;t rou&s;e every man to acknowledge the nece&s;&s;ity of our bleeding freely in this important conte&s;t.</P>
<P>TO apply the propere&s;t remedy on this occa&s;ion, may not fall within the &s;mall &s;phere of my di&s;cern|ment: What occurs I humbly offer to con&s;ideration. If the former annual profit of every Importer and Retailer was to be candidly and fairly &s;tated, and the deficiency, that might ari&s;e during the non-im|portation, made up to them by the public, I &s;hould with the utmo&s;t chearfulne&s;s pay my proportion of the tax;&mdash;but as it is not probable, that any Go|vernor would be hardy enough to give his a&s;&s;ent to a bill for that &s;ervice, it is a &s;cheme that mu&s;t be rejected. Therefore I would propo&s;e, that a large judicious Committee be cho&s;en, who &s;hould fix the rates, at which Merchants and Retailers might &s;ell
<PB N="8" REF="013760_0008_0F91A9C70E0CEC80">
their &s;tocks on hand; and that tho&s;e Rates be fixed &s;o high, as to be a probably &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for their &s;uffering in the public cau&s;e: And that they &s;hould become bound to each other, not to &s;ell under price. Thus every con&s;umer would contribute his proportion, and pay the joyful price of his li|berty. But before a &s;tep of this kind is taken, let it be by the <HI>joint voice</HI> of the <HI>country</HI> as well as <HI>town:</HI> Let <HI>their</HI> &s;entiments be taken, <HI>their</HI> liberties are con|cerned as well as ours; perhaps <HI>they</HI> may project &s;ome &s;cheme more likely to an&s;wer the end. Let us be open to every man's coun&s;el, we have but one point to aim at, and it matters not who hits the mark.</P>
<P>THE Honourable Hou&s;e of Burge&s;&s;es in Virginia, who&s;e noble &s;entiments of liberty, and indepen|dancy of &s;pirit, ju&s;tly entitle them to a foremo&s;t rank among&s;t the American Legi&s;latures, have ta|ken up the matter with a becoming mixture of firmne&s;s and moderation; and if I am led to con|trovert &s;ome of their opinions, it is with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect and deference. Had their Governor permit|ted them to continue the &s;e&s;&s;ion a few days longer, they would probably have made the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tric|tures on their own re&s;olves.&mdash;A tenderne&s;s for the Manufacturers of Great-Britain, &s;o far as it is con&s;i&s;tent with the welfare of America, is what eve|ry humane mind among&s;t us mu&s;t applaud; and I honour them for the &s;entiment: But &s;hould it appear on clo&s;er inve&s;tigation, that a partial attachment to <HI>their</HI> intere&s;t would e&s;&s;entially injure our own, no man can he&s;itate to determine on the part we ought to take. Impelled by re&s;entment again&s;t the Ea&s;t- India Company, for their ungenerous and <HI>officicus</HI> attempt to rivet on us the cruel &s;hackles forged by the <HI>iron hand</HI> of Parliament, it is not to be won|dered
<PB N="9" REF="013760_0009_0F91A9C730190CA0">
at, if every American &s;hould unite in a re&s;o|lution to let <HI>them</HI> feel the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of their folly. Should we determine on a partial non-impor|tation, by confining it &s;olely to Ea&s;t-India goods, it would undoubtedly be a very heavy blow to the Company, and might intere&s;t them in a repeal of the acts we complain of: But on the other hand, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, we &s;hould unite the manufactur|ing intere&s;t of England again&s;t the repeal, and there|by ca&s;t an unlooked for weight into the mini&s;terial &s;cale; for as many of the manufactures of India are imitated in England, and for others they make good &s;ub&s;titutes, we could not more effectually grati|fy the Engli&s;h arti&s;an, than by withdrawing our cu&s;tom from the India warehou&s;e; and in this the landed intere&s;t would concur. Whatever increa&s;es the demand for the manufactures of a country, even|tually extends to the Landholder; for the Trade&s;|man having money to &s;pend, can afford to pay a good price to the Farmer, and <HI>he</HI> of cour&s;e a good rent to the Landlord. Thus in&s;tead of facilitating our mea&s;ures, we &s;hould furni&s;h the Mini&s;ter with fre&s;h &s;trength to pro&s;ecute his determined plan of &s;ubjugating the Americans. However far the Pre|mier may have bent his force to &s;upport the <HI>India Company,</HI> I cannot think he will abandon the prin|ciple of taxing America, purely to &s;erve <HI>them.</HI> Should the &s;cheme of a partial non-importation take place, and be attended with the con&s;equence, here &s;urmi&s;ed, chagrined at the di&s;appointment, and mortified with the want of fore&s;ight, we mu&s;t <HI>&s;till</HI> have recour&s;e to other mea&s;ures. If a partial non-importation was thought ab&s;olutely necce&s;&s;ary, &s;trange as the propo&s;ition may &s;eem, I &s;hould think it more advi&s;eable to confine our&s;elves to the u&s;e of Ea&s;t-India goods &s;olely; whereby a jealou&s;y would be excited between the Engli&s;h and India
<PB N="10" REF="013760_0010_0F91A9C7F67BA990">
intere&s;t; and a repeal might thereby be brought about; but this is by no means con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>my</HI> apprehen&s;ion of the matter. It is <HI>A GENERAL NON- IMPORTATION HONESTLY ADHERED TO,</HI> that mu&s;t work our deliverance; it is the only natural peaceable remedy in our power. It may be &s;aid, that thereby the poor manufacturers of Great- Britain will be reduced to great want and di&s;tre&s;s, and that as they by no means promoted the acts, they claim the &s;ame rea&s;oning in their favour, as our Brethren in the i&s;lands: but their ca&s;es are by no means &s;imilar. The I&s;landers might actually &s;tarve without our &s;upplies; but the poor of Eng|land <HI>cannot, will not,</HI> peri&s;h with famine, whil&s;t there is bread in the land. The laws of England &s;ecure a &s;upport to the nece&s;&s;itous; the rich, who made tho&s;e laws, know they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;upport them; and &s;hould it be dealt out with a &s;canty hand, the full|fed &s;pirit of Engli&s;hmen would quickly trample down the di&s;tinctions of <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum,</HI> and ad|mini&s;ter to their own wants. In&s;tances of this &s;ort are not to &s;eek; the annals of George the &s;econd and third produce them in abundance; and no &s;ub|ject has more &s;eriou&s;ly engro&s;&s;ed the attention of thinking men in the nation than the clamour about provi&s;ions. Here we may &s;en&s;ibly wound them, but let it not be a mortal blow: far be it from the heart of a child e&s;&s;entially to injure a parent; let our inci&s;ions be no deeper than are ju&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge the corrupted ma&s;s that collects about her vitals, and to couch the cataract in her eyes; and if her auditory nerves are too much clogged, let us inject a little of the <HI>&s;piritus Americani,</HI> and re&s;tore to her that nece&s;&s;ary &s;en&s;e:&mdash;But to quit the metaphor. Let us endeavour to convince them, that the I&s;land of Great Britain is properly a land of manufacturers, &s;urrounded by harbours for exportation; and that
<PB N="11" REF="013760_0011_0F91A9C8C11B66C8">
the continent of America is a mo&s;t valuable granary at her &s;ervice. Let them but repeal all re&s;trictive laws, and freely open to us their ports, and then I tru&s;t they will never &s;ee their Manufacturers
<Q>for&s;aken, nor their &s;eed begging bread.</Q></P>
<P>THE genius of America is agriculture, and for ages to come mu&s;t continue &s;o. An exten&s;ive wilderne&s;s to the we&s;tward will long receive the gradual over|flowings of population; and the Manufacturer of Great-Britain will never meet with a formidable rival in the &s;hape of an American Farmer, &s;o long as he can purcha&s;e the cloathing of his family with the produce of his fields. 'Tis numbers clo&s;ely pent up together, that point out the nece&s;&s;ity of applying art to nature, and new modeling her materials.</P>
<P>I crave your patience, Brethren, to attend me a little further. We have now had time to take a retro&s;pective view of our conduct towards the dif|ferent cargoes of Tea &s;ent to this continent; &s;ome of which have been de&s;troyed, &s;ome landed, and &s;ome &s;ent back. Moderate men begin to think, that the de&s;truction of the Tea at Bo&s;ton was rather a ra&s;h procedure, and that recompence ought to be made. If I under&s;tand the Philadelphian Com|mittee right, they meant to advi&s;e &s;uch a mea&s;ure to our afflicted Brethren; and I heartily concur with them therein. Some among&s;t us congratulate the Penn&s;ylvanians on getting &s;o happily through <HI>their</HI> affair; but, Brethren, I cannot think we &s;hould leave it here; if the Tea de&s;troyed at Bo&s;ton requires payment, on a principle of equity and ju&s;tice, be|cau&s;e it was the property of others, with equal pro|priety may it be expected from us to pay for the freight and damages of the Tea &s;ent back from hence. The property of the Ea&s;t-India Company
<PB N="12" REF="013760_0012_0F91A9C976BFE650">
was alike injured in both ca&s;es; and, from a parity of rea&s;oning, it becomes a charge upon us. Let it not be &s;aid the Company <HI>has made no &s;uch demand,</HI> therefore <HI>we will make no &s;uch propo&s;al.</HI> I apprehend the laws of right and wrong are eternally and in|variably the &s;ame; and, from a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, we ought to be beforehand with the payment. He that is no hone&s;ter than the laws of government require, will never &s;tand foremo&s;t in the li&s;ts of honour.&mdash; Yes, my Brethren, I am bold to recommend the vo|luntary offer of a compen&s;ation, and &s;hall heartily &s;ub&s;cribe my quota.</P>
<P>BRETHREN&mdash;I beg leave to extend my views &s;till a little further. After every a&s;&s;embly on the conti|nent has atttempted to take legal and con&s;titutional mea&s;ures for redre&s;s, and either their attempts are defeated, or their mea&s;ures fail, then arrives a mo&s;t intere&s;ting, a mo&s;t alarming period. When a nati|on can derive no benefit from its government, the very end of government is fru&s;trated; and the wretched inhabitants are reduced near to a &s;tate of nature, and have all to begin anew.&mdash;I cannot help expre&s;&s;ing my a&s;toni&s;hment, as I proceed in this &s;ub|ject, at the ra&s;hne&s;s and unparalleled folly of Great Britain, a nation &s;o highly valued for its jealous pre&s;ervation of civil liberty, that her conduct to|wards her colonies on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, mu&s;t greatly tarni&s;h the glory of her annals. Has &s;he trained up her children, like calves in the &s;tall, to fall bloody victims by her own unnatural cruel hands?&mdash;What could &s;he wi&s;h from us more than we freely gave? For whom have we toiled in this once uncultivated wilderne&s;s? For who&s;e benefit do we ri&s;e up early, and lie down late, is it not for Great Britain?&mdash;Are not our &s;ails &s;pread to every wind that blows under heaven, to bear away the
<PB N="13" REF="013760_0013_0F91A9CA6BAF0B60">
dear earnings of the &s;weat of our brow, that they may at la&s;t centre in Britain? Are we not her faith|ful generous cu&s;tomers for all the various commo|dities of her indu&s;trious workmen? Do we clamor at the prices they exact! Do we not cheerfully pay whatever they are plea&s;ed to charge us for their goods? Whenever, in the cour&s;e of trade, we collect the &s;pecie of other nations, we lavi&s;hly pour it into Britannia's lap; whil&s;t, with an hone&s;t confidence in each other's honor, we content our&s;elves with a medium <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paper Money.</NOTE> of commerce of no intrin&s;ic value, that our once fond Mother may revel in our real wealth. What more, in a commercial way, has &s;he a right to wi&s;h?</P>
<P>BUT to return from this digre&s;&s;ion,&mdash;If Great Bri|tain, by an arbitrary exertion of power, reduces us to a &s;tate of anarchy: &s;o much mu&s;t every man be en|amoured with the ble&s;&s;ings of civil government, that he will wi&s;h to rai&s;e from the ruins a new fabrick &s;omewhat re&s;embling the old.&mdash;If we cannot have the benefit of advice from our con&s;titutional A&s;&s;em|blies, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the <HI>Vox Populi</HI>:&mdash; A new Phoenix mu&s;t ari&s;e out of the a&s;hes.&mdash;There|fore I would re&s;pectfully propo&s;e, that every county in every province &s;hould elect as many members for a popular A&s;&s;embly, as they now return to their le|gal A&s;&s;embly. That the qualifications for the elec|tors, and elected, be the &s;ame in both elections. That when this is done throughout the continent, a place of congre&s;s &s;hould be appointed; and each popular A&s;&s;embly &s;hould in&s;truct and &s;end at lea&s;t &s;ix members, and that this GRAND ASSEMBLY &s;hould unite in a firm and re&s;pectful remon&s;trance to the whole Legi&s;lature of Great Britain; a&s;&s;erting
<PB N="14" REF="013760_0014_0F91A9CAEA69F0D0">
our natural and acquired rights, and tendering <HI>of|fers of accommodation.</HI> For, Brethren, we are unit|ed to Great Britain by the &s;tronge&s;t and clo&s;e&s;t ties of intere&s;t, as well as affection; &s;he has a right to expect <HI>&s;omething</HI> from us at &s;ome future day;&mdash;with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion I &s;peak it&mdash;I &s;ay &s;he has a right to ex|pect <HI>&s;omething</HI> from us, and the time is perhaps not very di&s;tant, when we &s;hould determine what <HI>that</HI> &s;omething &s;hall be.</P>
<P>IT has been formerly urged that the Americans, buying the manufactures of Britain, do actually and <HI>bona fide</HI> pay all the taxes levied on the Manu|facturers; becau&s;e a &s;ufficient living profit mu&s;t re|main to the Manufacturer, after paying tho&s;e taxes. This argument, tho' at fir&s;t view &s;pecious, I appre|hend is not &s;o exten&s;ive in its conclu&s;ion, as the writers on the &s;ubject imagine. If we contend that we pay a <HI>proportionable</HI> part of the taxes of Great Britain, by purcha&s;ing her manufactures, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that we do not pay higher for tho&s;e goods than her own inhabitants, who con&s;ume of their own manufactures a much larger quantity than we do.&mdash;Therefore on the &s;ubject of taxes ari&s;ing out of their manufactures, we with them, and they with us, are ju&s;t upon a level; and of cour&s;e every actual tax paid by them towards the &s;upport of go|vernment, exclu&s;ive of what they pay in the prices of the manufactures they u&s;e, is ju&s;t &s;o much more than we pay.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be &s;aid that England, being greatly enriched by having &s;uch valuable cu&s;tomers, is bound, in point of intere&s;t, to &s;ecure and protect us; and &s;hould we determine never to contribute a &s;ingle farthing towards her coffers, but in the way of trade, and even had &s;he no means in her power

of extorting it from us, &s;till would &s;he continue to &s;hield us with her arm, and cover us from danger. For what man throws up a farm as u&s;ele&s;s for &s;o weak a rea&s;on, as it's not always yielding him an hundred fold; he will e&s;timate the whole charge of cultivation, and then, if the produce exceeds the co&s;t, he is encouraged to proceed.

But waving the policy of England, let us, my Brethren, with the true &s;pirit of hone&s;t men, do the thing which is ju&s;t. <HI>Let Ame|rica be characterized by an eye of di&s;cernment, a heart of integrity, and an open hand.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true we have internal taxes, for the &s;upport of government among&s;t our&s;elves; but tho&s;e taxes, only re&s;pecting our internal convenience and &s;ecu|rity, include no competent idea of defence again&s;t a foreign power. If America &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h an independance, which I pray Heaven avert, we &s;hould &s;oon fall a prey to &s;ome of the maritime Princes, unle&s;s we could maintain a fleet &s;ufficient to guard our coa&s;t; how far this would be practicable, I leave every American to judge for him&s;elf. As the ca&s;e &s;tands at pre&s;ent, we turn our eyes to Britain on every impending danger; we look to her fleets for protec|tion and defence. Ought we not then, my Bre|thren, to think of contributing &s;ome portion of the national expence? Though in the all powerful hands of Providence, the fleets of nations, and the

armies of Kings, are but as chaff before the wind, and his <HI>fiat</HI> is &s;ufficient to &s;creen us from every ma|chination of evil; yet as he is plea&s;ed to permit his crea|tures to breath forth that &s;pirit of rancour and ill-will towards each other, for purpo&s;es in his wi&s;dom far beyond my conception, the concerns of human civil government point out carnal means of pre&s;ervation; and, till a much wi&s;hed univer&s;al re&s;toration of purity &s;ucceeds, the policy of nations mu&s;t partake of the &s;pirit of war. Therefore, Brethren, &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould tender them &s;ome annual &s;um for the &s;upport of government, and rai&s;e it in certain quotas among&s;t our&s;elves. Let us &s;tipulate for the &s;ame free trade <HI>they</HI> have; and let America be con&s;idered as joined to Great Britain. If the inhabitants of London, Liverpool, and Bri&s;|tol, enjoy an equal privilege in trade, why &s;hould not <HI>we</HI> be con&s;idered in the &s;ame point of light? What narrow &s;oul'd policy is it that draws a line of di&s;tinction between a Briton and an American? Let the wealth of the Briti&s;h empire equally diffu&s;e it&s;elf, and like water find its level. If a flood of wealth pours into a country through the channels of trade, it quickly ebbs out again in pur&s;uit of luxuries and dainties; and thus, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive undu|lations, gives motion to the &s;prings of the whole empire. Our di&s;tant &s;ituation renders it impracti|cable to unite us with each other in legi&s;lation. Let each govern its own internal affairs, and all unite in the grand <HI>bulwark</HI> of the nation. What &s;hall be the portion for America to contribute, will become a que&s;tion of deep deci&s;ion, nor &s;hould it be ha&s;tily determined. I would wi&s;h England to make the de|mand, and leave us to deliberate on it.&mdash;I know America would be generous,&mdash;I hope England would be ju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="013760_0017_0F91A9D0ECBD0C78">BEFORE the point is finally &s;ettled, let it be well a&s;certained what is to be under&s;tood by <HI>acts for re|gulating of trade.</HI> Among&s;t our political writers on the American &s;ide of the que&s;tion, there are &s;ome of &s;uch high characters for judgment and di&s;cern|ment, as to make me le&s;s po&s;itive in a&s;&s;erting <HI>my</HI> opinion on the &s;ubject.

Let it be remembered that the King has a negative upon all our bills, which ought to be deemed a &s;ufficient check upon our conduct. We acknowledge the King of Great Britain for our Sovereign&mdash;we love him&mdash;we revere him&mdash;we are attached to him both by policy and principle; but <HI>cannot&mdash;mu&s;t not</HI> allow <HI>any kind of authority in his Parliament</HI>; and if <HI>that</HI> Parliament would but attend to the true con&s;titu|tional intere&s;t of the empire, they would cea&s;e to claim it.</P>
<P>AND now, Brethren, let me recommend unani|mity and prudence among&s;t our&s;elves. Let no di&s;|tinctions of <HI>&s;ects</HI> or <HI>countries</HI> prevail among&s;t us.

<P>THE &s;parkling ideas of a warm imagination are too apt to &s;oar into the regions of danger, and, with|out providing a proper retreat, involve the bold adventurer in unthought of perplexities. But let us, my Brethren, like &s;kilful Generals, &s;end our &s;couts abroad&mdash;view the de&s;igns and &s;trength of our enemy, and &s;ecure the mo&s;t advantageous po&s;ts the ground will admit.&mdash;Calmne&s;s in council, and previous manoeuvres, mark as &s;trongly the genius of a Gene|ral, as pre&s;ence of mind, and courage in the field. The nation who&s;e wi&s;e policy in the cabinet baffles the invidious attempts of ho&s;tile neighbours, without calling forth the horrors ot military carnage, &s;hines brighter in the annals of a chri&s;tain age than if poutrayed with all the &s;plendid clangor of arms died in blood, and &s;urrounded with the victorious tro|phies of fallen thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>THOSE who &s;tand on higher ground than I do, may probably have their circle of vi&s;ion enlarged, and with &s;tronger optic organs look further into di&s;tant events.&mdash;Mine I confe&s;s have been too much confined to a narrower &s;phere; and nothing but my country's weal could tempt me to clamber up the rugged mountains of politicks.</P>
<P>I have already, with much &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, declared my &s;entiments, that a <HI>general non-importation</HI> was the only weapon we &s;hould wield in this unnatural mi|ni&s;terial war; and wi&s;h I may be happy enough to convince my countrymen that we need not go further.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="013760_0020_0F91A9D329202708">SHOULD the <HI>propo&s;al</HI> made by &s;ome of our &s;outhern Brethren, and countenanced by &s;ome in this province, be adopted&mdash;the <HI>propo&s;al of a non-exportation to Bri|tain</HI>&mdash;I conceive it would be but giving our&s;elves a more deadly wound&mdash;<HI>Whatever our country, by its in|du&s;try and frugality, can &s;pare for exportation, is ju&s;t &s;o much added to its riches</HI>; whether we depo&s;it it in the hands of an Engli&s;h merchant till called for, or order it immediately back in mercantile inve&s;tment.</P>
<P>THAT a heavy dept is incurred by us in England, for the &s;everal articles of her commerce, is undoubt|edly true; and that it is a debt which we mean hone&s;tly to pay, I believe is al&s;o <HI>as</HI> true; and that after the contracted limitation of credit is expired, the Engli&s;h factors will expect, and the American mer|chants will allow, that an intere&s;t of five per cent. ought to commence; and though the intercour&s;e between the two countries &s;hould have a temporary ce&s;&s;ation, the terms of the fir&s;t contract would &s;till be binding, and an accumulating load of debt pre&s;s with aggravating weight upon our &s;houlders.</P>

Admit then, we &s;top all intercour&s;e with England.&mdash;From that in&s;tant will begin an intere&s;t of five per cent. on the enormous &s;um of three millions, which amounts to no le&s;s than one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum; a &s;um that mu&s;t actually

How then can we recon|cile our&s;elves to the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;o flagrant an act of inju&s;tice; but if our feelings of virtue fail us, let us apply to tho&s;e tender &s;trings of intere&s;t, which are ever at uni&s;ons in the great commercial harp; <HI>there</HI> let us &s;trike, and the &s;ound will vibrate in every ear.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid that
<Q>whatever a country, by its indu&s;try and frugality, can &s;pare for exportation is ju&s;t <HI>&s;o much</HI> added to its riches.</Q>
Now if we dam up this &s;urplus among&s;t our&s;elves, like clo&s;ing the pores, or checking per&s;piration, we produce a putrid collection&mdash;a confined fermentation &s;ucceeds&mdash; and nature &s;truggling with the di&s;order, throws the body into a fever; which though frequently effecting a cure, &s;ometimes proves fatal.

<P>THOUGH in my la&s;t paper, with the impetuous rapidity of a heated fancy, I darted through aeras yet unborn, and plunged into the di&s;tant regions of futurity, I beg leave, my brethren, to conduct you back in &s;afety, to the important and intere&s;ting reign of George the Third.&mdash;A Prince, who&s;e goodne&s;s of &s;oul, and un&s;u&s;pecting heart, unfortu|nately for his people, have unwarily betrayed him into the en&s;naring mea&s;ures of de&s;igning men; men who&s;e lu&s;t for power, and rapacious pur&s;uit after riches, would tempt them to &s;wallow up both King and and kingdom, were they not &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of exhibiting to public view &s;o often&s;ible a power as royalty, under who&s;e patronage and protection they are artfully undermining the con&s;titution, and prepar|ing to commit the mo&s;t horrid parricide on their country. Lulled into &s;ecurity, and wallowing in luxuries, the nation is &s;ilently gliding down the &s;tream.&mdash;The bark &s;eems at re&s;t&mdash;the &s;urface of the deceitful current is calm and &s;erene&mdash;the banks are in verdure, and the &s;hrubs and the flowers beguile with their fragrance, whil&s;t the foaming roar of the di&s;|tant cataract is &s;carce &s;eintly heard.&mdash;Alas, Britannia! &mdash;without &s;ome friendly eye perceives thy floating danger, and ru&s;hing into the flood drags thy galley to &s;hore&mdash;thou art gone&mdash;irretrievably gone; and may America prove that friend.</P>

<P>IT is now generally allowed that a congre&s;s of the colonies is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and as I have no doubt that part of their re&s;ult will be the appoint|ment of amba&s;&s;adors to attend, in per&s;on, with our complaints at the Court of Great Britain; every aid, however feeble, cannot be deemed impertnent; and every argument that can be held forth, to &s;upport the common cau&s;e, will at lea&s;t be li&s;tened to; and certain it is, the grand de&s;ideratum on this occa&s;ion is to embark with the &s;tronge&s;t and cleare&s;t proofs we can procure, to convince the rulers, and the people of Great Britain, that it is <HI>their intere&s;t</HI> to at|tend to our grievances, and grant us redre&s;s.</P>
<P>PERHAPS in pur&s;uing this object, it may not be ami&s;s to make a few political calculations; that we may ex|hibit, at one view, the va&s;t importance of the Colo|nies, I am well aware that the ob&s;ervations I am now about to make, will at the fir&s;t glance, have &s;o much the air of vi&s;ionary &s;peculation, that many of my readers will turn from me with indignant contempt; but they will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, I am endeavouring to unfold to view, the mighty chart of a cultivated Continent; for cultivated it undoubtedly will be, be|fore our children have &s;lept many ages in the peaceful

<P>PETER the Great, Czar of Mu&s;covy, with a genius penetrative and per&s;evering, pierced far into the dark abodes of futurity; and, from a wild barbarous and contemptible &s;tate, formed a plan of empire, of which his predece&s;&s;ors had never conceived the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea; and which at this day has ri&s;en to &s;uch a for|midable height of grandeur, that her connections are &s;ought with re&s;pect by the fir&s;t powers in Europe. If a century before the acce&s;&s;ion of Peter to the Czar|&s;hip, a diviner had foretold her approaching glory, his countrymen would have treated him with &s;corn and deri&s;ion; and well they might, for nothing but a genius like Peter's could have &s;urmounted the pre|judices and cu&s;toms of barbarians. But with us, where every liberal art has its votaries, where &s;cience enlarges the mind, and where manly freedom is va|lued and enjoyed, nothing but a retrogration into the &s;avage ob&s;curity often centuries ago can ob&s;truct or retard the rapidity of our progre&s;s.</P>
<P>AFTER craving the kind indulgence of my reader, in gratifying me with a latitude to pur&s;ue an inve&s;|tigating fancy, I will venture to entru&s;t to his candor the harmle&s;s reveries of a lei&s;ure hour.</P>

If we divide this into farms of 100 acres each there will be 46 millions 9 hundred and 97 thou&s;and 2 hundred and 80 farms; and allowing each farm to maintain five per&s;ons, the lands of North America will &s;upport 234 millions nine hundred and 86 thou&s;and and four hundred inhabitants. Perhaps it will be &s;aid that the great &s;paces covered by lakes, bays and rivers, and the large portion of land unfit for cultivation in every part of the continent, particularly in Green|land, will render a large di&s;count nece&s;&s;ary; but if we con&s;ider what va&s;t numbers collect in cities, towns, and villages, without a &s;ingle acre of ground to ten families, it may be rea&s;onably conjectured that there|by a more than &s;ufficient allowance will be made.

the number before &s;pecified, viz. 234,986,400, for a crooked round number &s;ay 235 millions; which is nearly equal to the number of inhabitants in Europe, A&s;ia and Africa; &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome writers to be about 300 millions.</P>
<P>AS I proceed in this &s;ubject I am &s;truck with won|der at the immen&s;ity of the view before me; but when I contract my &s;ight to the minutia of the politi|cal movements of England, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at their debates.

All the de&s;iderata of their government centre in power, and yet they are employing every po&s;&s;ible agent to defeat their own purpo&s;es.&mdash;Wi&s;e and prudent mea|&s;ures would &s;o conciliate the affections of the Ameri|cans, that they would readily fall in with the &s;upre|macy of the <HI>proper</HI> legi&s;lative branch, and &s;ubmit to a negative controul for ages to come, if violence and oppre&s;&s;ion did not rend them a&s;under.</P>
<P>THE &s;eat of government re&s;ts in England; all pro|fitable prices are ve&s;ted in the crown. The right of making war or peace are royal prerogatives.

<P>IT has already been &s;hewn that America contains about 4,700 millions of acres, now if we &s;uppo&s;e a quit rent to the crown of only one farthing &s;terling per acre, it amounts to the annual &s;um of 4 millions and 95 thou&s;and 8 hundred and 33 pounds. It will be &s;aid that a great portion of the inhabited part of America is granted in charters, without &s;uch quit rents being re&s;erved, and therefore it can never amount to the &s;um here &s;urmi&s;ed. Let us then &s;trike off one fourth part, which will be a &s;ufficient allowance for the pre&s;ent &s;ettlements, as well as for waters and wa&s;te lands as already mention|ed.&mdash;But if the crown was to in&s;truct its Gover|nors to grant the lands as fa&s;t as they are purcha&s;ed of the natives to <HI>actual</HI> &s;ettlers, without the exorbi|tant claims of a &s;tring of officers, the quit rents might be rai&s;ed to even <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">All lands hereafter granted in New-York are to bear a halfpenny &s;terling quit-rent, and be &s;old at pub|lic &s;ale for the benefit of the Crown.</NOTE> a halfpenny &s;terling per acre, and the &s;ettlers would be gainers by the ad|vance. Then &s;triking off one fourth of 4,700 mil|lions of acres, and affixing a halpenny &s;terling on the remainder, viz. 3,525 millions, the annual reve|nue from the quit rents would be 7 millions 3 hundred and 43 thou&s;and 7 hundred and 50 pounds. Here would be a tax &s;o equal and ea&s;y, that the wheels of government might move without friction, and

<P>SOME, who affect to treat her trade to America with contempt, when compared with her other connexions, would do well to make an accurate view of the great commercial &s;cale. The Princes of Europe, &s;en&s;ible of the va&s;t importance of trade and manufactures, are every were exerting the utmo&s;t of their influence among&s;t their &s;ubjects, to train and cultivate the commercial arts; how much England has already felt the effect of their de&s;igns, the langui&s;hing &s;tate of <HI>&s;ome</HI> branches of their manufactures may feelingly and forcibly inform them.

<P>POSSIBLY &s;ome may be alarmed with the motion of granting to the Crown of England a halfpenny &s;terling on our land. I acknowledge, on a cur&s;ory in&s;pection, the expediency of it may prove doubt|ful; but, brethren, if you will plea&s;e to indulge me a little further, in giving &s;cope to a <HI>political imagi|nation,</HI> we will examine the &s;ubject in a pretty ex|ten&s;ive point of view.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="013760_0046_0F91A9F502B91908">THE levying of taxes on a nation, in &s;uch ju&s;t directions, as to fall equally on all, however de|&s;irable, has been hitherto deemed one of the politi|cal impo&s;&s;ibilities of Government; but every &s;tate&s;|man, who pro&s;ecutes the happine&s;s and &s;trength of a country, will make it his indefatigable &s;tudy to approach as near to that de&s;ired equality, as the na|ture and con&s;titution of the &s;tate will admit.</P>
<P>THERE are few governments in the world, but have ari&s;en to their pre&s;ent height of grandeur, or fallen to their pre&s;ent &s;tate of decay, by in&s;en&s;ible and unpremeditated gradations.&mdash;Barbari&s;m has lei&s;urely fled before civilization, without leaving any certain fixed plan behind. From century to cen|tury the forms of government have been varied, but have ever been calculated to the meridian of the pre&s;ent day.&mdash;Perhaps it is left for us in America, boldly to chalk out a new plan, and &s;hew to <HI>reviving</HI> Ea&s;tern realms, if <HI>reviving</HI> &s;hould ever be their fate, that the true art of government is yet to unfold.&mdash; But I fear to proceed&mdash;methinks I grow pre&s;umptuous in my views, and, brethren, your patience begins to be exhau&s;ted&mdash;&s;hall I proceed?&mdash;or &s;hall I drop the pen?&mdash;You're &s;ilent&mdash;I'll venture on.&mdash;</P>
<P>WHEN a country is &s;o enten&s;ive in it&s;elf, as to produce the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to its inhabitants, its land may be ju&s;tly &s;aid, to be the origin and fountain of all its wealth; and the value of every article of its production, will in &s;ome mea&s;ure be regulated by the value of the land. If the landlords of a country rent out their grounds at twenty &s;hil|lings per acre, and the ground yields but ten bu&s;hels of wheat per acre, and the wheat &s;ells but for two &s;hillings per bu&s;hel, the farmer will be inevitably
<PB N="47" REF="013760_0047_0F91A9F5C2EEEE48">
ruined. Then either the landlord mo&s;t lower his rent, or the wheat bring a higher price, otherwi&s;e the ground will remain untilled. If the e&s;tate is &s;o circum&s;tanced, that the rent <HI>cannot be lowered,</HI> the wheat will undoubtedly ri&s;e; for the farmer will not pur&s;ue his labour without a living pay. Thus the value of the produce of a country will ever bear a proportion to the <HI>value</HI> of the land, if that <HI>value</HI> cannot be abated; and, of con&s;equence, every inha|bitant will be affected in proportion as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more or le&s;s property. Now lands &s;ubject to <HI>Quit|rents</HI> are &s;o circum&s;tanced, that the <HI>value</HI> in that re&s;pect <HI>cannot be abated.</HI></P>
<P>IF we &s;uppo&s;e all future lands granted in America to be charged with the annual payment of an half-penny &s;terling per acre, the con&s;umers of the produce of the &s;oil, mu&s;t pay a certain proportion of the <HI>rent or tax</HI>; and thus there will be a pretty equal contri|bution through the land. But to make &s;ome <HI>greater</HI> provi&s;ion for a future <HI>greater</HI> day, the&s;e lands might be granted at an halfpenny for the fir&s;t 100 years, conditioned to advance a halfpenny every century, for ten centuries to come; by which time, if not long before, the whole continent would probably be full &s;ettled. The neat revenue would then be &s;eventy- three millions four hundred and thirty-&s;even thou|&s;and five hundred pounds; nor would this tax ever be thought high. Exten&s;ively wild as the&s;e bounds may &s;eem, they are &s;till within the limits which time &s;hall encircle. When Egbert, the fir&s;t mo|narch of England, fir&s;t &s;wayed his &s;cepter, it wanted but 27 years of being as di&s;tant from the reign of George the third as from the pre&s;ent important day to this mighty aera of American grandeur:&mdash; and <HI>&s;ix</HI> &s;uch periods even <HI>then</HI> had rolled away &s;ince
<PB N="48" REF="013760_0048_0F91A9F677E75338">
creation began. But to return&mdash;If it be &s;aid, that the great difference in the qualities of the &s;oil would render the tax unequal, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the wor&s;t lands will always be the la&s;t taken up, and that every &s;ub&s;equent purcha&s;er of good land will pay proportionably more for it, as it excels in qua|lity. In countries where they are circum&s;cribed within narrow limits, and the &s;ea almo&s;ts &s;urrounds them, the inhabitants are obliged for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to borrow &s;upport from the main; therefore when the trade of &s;uch a nation greatly exceeds the value of its lands, it is rea&s;onable to look to her commerce for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in defraying the nece&s;&s;ary expence of government; as in England, where the whole rents of the land &s;ome years ago were e&s;timated at only nine millions, when probably the pubic charges amounted to &s;ix.&mdash;But in this mighty continent the inland tracts are &s;o immen&s;e, and &s;o di&s;tant from the &s;ea, that a proper land tax, judiciou&s;ly laid on all new granted lands, will in all probability, in a &s;eries of years, an&s;wer every nece&s;&s;ary expence.</P>
<P>I HOPE I &s;hall not hereby too much alarm the landed man, by propo&s;ing to lay the whole burthen of the tax on the landed intere&s;t; for it ought to be con&s;idered that, with re&s;pect to future purcha&s;ers, every man now re&s;ident on the continent &s;tands ex|actly on an equal footing; and every purcha&s;e made after &s;uch a regulation, will be a fair and open con|tract made between the purcha&s;er and the public: nay, it will prove an immediate advantage to the pre&s;ent land-holder, who&s;e lands not being &s;ubject to &s;uch an impo&s;t, like tho&s;e in England clear of tythes, will always command a higher price.</P>

<P>LET us, my brethren, con&s;ider <HI>what are the real and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;aries of life.</HI> We &s;hall find them pre&s;ently reduced to the two &s;imple points of <HI>provi|&s;ions for the &s;upport of our natures,</HI> and <HI>coverings from the inclemencies of the weather.</HI> The former an all gracious Providence has amply and generou&s;ly pro|vided us; a provi&s;ion for which my heart, with reve|rential gratitude, bows at his Almighty throne, and thankfully accepts for me and mine my humble &s;hare; and may every depending &s;oul unite with me in humiliating wonder and amazement at the <HI>merciful</HI> continuation of his ble&s;&s;ing to a people too much e&s;tranged from his ways.

Every nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>&s;helter from the weather</HI> we have among&s;t our&s;elves, and the means of procuring every <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> implement of labour and hu&s;bandry. Stone,

<Q>How many things are here, which I do not want.</Q>
&mdash;But to return to the principal and mo&s;t important object, our clothes. Many parts of the continent are &s;o well adapted to the rai&s;ing of flax, that it might become a &s;taple article; and in others, a little further to the &s;outhward, hemp might be improved to good advantage, on ground not na|turally very rich; and cotton we know will come to good perfection in the Carolinas and Georgia; the&s;e, when wrought up, will provide us very amply with &s;ummer wear; for I a&s;&s;ure you, brethren, it is very po&s;&s;ible for the <HI>faire&s;t Lady and fine&s;t Gentleman</HI> to <HI>exi&s;t,</HI> at lea&s;t four months of the twelve, with the&s;e American productions, though <HI>rough and coar&s;e.</HI> But the greate&s;t difficulty is to provide for the winter bla&s;ts, in our northern colonies. The wool rai&s;ed on the continent is yearly con&s;umed among&s;t us: There|fore for the amount of woollens, formerly imported from England, we mu&s;t now think of a &s;ub&s;titute in

America, if Parliament &s;hould hold out the &s;iege, till our &s;tores are exhau&s;ted, and our clothes are in rags; which &s;ome think they will certainly attempt.&mdash;In part to remedy this evil, it might be well immedi|ately to revive the re&s;olution, formerly taken, to in|crea&s;e the breed of our &s;heep, by pre&s;erving the lambs, to as great a number as the farms can po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport; though this, I am &s;en&s;ible, will not furni&s;h us a &s;ufficient &s;upply for many years to come. The Neutrals formerly &s;ettled on our Commons, being reduced to great want, picked their old clothes to pieces, and new &s;pun them up: An example not un|worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>A FULL &s;uit of clothes, for a common &s;ized man, will take about &s;even pounds of wool, and perhaps more for a woman; which I believe will require, on an average, at lea&s;t three &s;heep: Therefore if every farm con&s;i&s;t of five per&s;ons, as &s;ome wills be women, and &s;ome children, we may &s;uppo&s;e it to require <HI>fif|teen &s;heep</HI> to &s;upply the family in clothes; a number not very con&s;iderable, and yet perhaps more by one fourth than our farms, one with another, &s;upport; and then, as a con&s;iderable part of the inhabitants in each province dwell in towns and villages, the number of &s;heep mu&s;t &s;till be further increa&s;ed, before <HI>they</HI> can be &s;upplied: and after all, we have made no allowance for &s;tockings, or coverings to our beds, which articles alone will at pre&s;ent con&s;ume all the wool on the continent. Thus we might be reduced at la&s;t, by an ob&s;tinate per&s;evering Mini&s;ter, to an ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, if we had no other <HI>re&s;our&s;e.</HI> A fear of this, I am per&s;uaded, di&s;courages many from joining heartily in a non-importation agreement.

<P>ANOTHER &s;ubject I would beg leave to remark on.

We are obliged to tell them, Gentlemen, the di&s;tre&s;|&s;es of our country oblige us with reluctance to call on you for a &s;acrifice, which we are fully &s;en&s;ible mu&s;t be highly injurious to your intere&s;ts.&mdash;<HI>You</HI> only are the men by whom redre&s;s can come; and on <HI>your</HI> vir|tue, and di&s;intere&s;ted love of your country, we are &s;olely to rely; therefore we reque&s;t you for the cau&s;e of liberty, for the &s;ake of tran&s;mitting freedom to <HI>your</HI> children, and <HI>our</HI> children, to lend us your aid to &s;ave our country.

<P>ARGUMENTS may po&s;&s;ibly be adduced in &s;upport of the mea&s;ure, which have never occurred to my un|der&s;tanding; it is not from a vindictive tenacity of opinion, that I am thus &s;trenuous, but from a de&s;ire of ob&s;erving the &s;tricte&s;t rules of ju&s;tice in our pro|ceedings. Some I know have objected to our con&s;i|dering the hard ca&s;e of the merchant and retailer, affirming "<HI>that it is a mea&s;ure the country have been ever aver&s;e to:</HI>" If it be really &s;o, why have not the re&s;olves from the &s;everal counties declared it?&mdash;I have carefully examined mo&s;t of them, if not all, and don't remember to have met with &s;uch a &s;entiment; nor can I conceive the country &s;o void of genero&s;ity as to wi&s;h to regain their liberties without bearing their &s;hare of the burthen. I will not believe they de&s;erve &s;o injurious a reflection, nor that they de&s;ire &s;o unju&s;t an exemption.&mdash;Let it not be &s;aid that the mea&s;ure of a non-importation, if &s;piritedly entered into, will &s;oon effect its purpo&s;e, and that by the time the merchant has &s;old off his &s;tock, the di&s;pute will be over, there|fore he will be no &s;ufferer by the re&s;triction. It &s;hould be remembered, the profit of the vender ari&s;es from the quantity of goods &s;old, and that whenever his &s;tore remains without a &s;upply his &s;ales mu&s;t be daily le&s;s. He that imports three thou&s;and &s;terling per annum, is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ell annually to that amount; and of cour&s;e whenever his imports &s;top, his &s;ales mu&s;t begin to decrea&s;e; in le&s;s than twelve months his &s;tore will be un&s;orted, and his choice of goods &s;o &s;mall that the profits on his &s;ales will &s;carce pay his hou&s;e rent.</P>

But on the other hand, if our oppo&s;ition &s;hould be &s;lower in its operation than our &s;anguine wi&s;hes would lead us to hope, what are the unhappy traders to do? To what branch of bu&s;ine&s;s can they fly for &s;upport? Their numbers are great, their families large, and many of them far advanced in life. Shall we &s;end them to the woods to hew down the trees, and learn thus late in life the laborious bu&s;ine&s;s of agriculture.&mdash;Think not that I am endeavouring to draw an exaggerated pic|ture of di&s;tre&s;s; it is from the feelings of my heart I &s;peak, feelings which &s;hould awaken every mind to attend to the &s;ituation of a brother, and impre&s;s it with a de&s;ire of a&s;&s;i&s;ting to ward off an impending blow.</P>
<P>SOME may &s;ay the accumulated profits of their trade will amply enable them to &s;u&s;tain a ce&s;&s;ation of bu&s;ine&s;s; but we well know &s;mall is the number thus circum&s;tanced; yet admitting it was generally the ca&s;e, what mode of rea&s;oning can be produced to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>their</HI> bearing the whole load on their &s;houlders, whil&s;t the re&s;t of us who are <HI>equally intere&s;ted,</HI> are <HI>equally able.</HI> The incumbent expences of government are never &s;o large, even in times of the greate&s;t danger, but that a few among&s;t the great and rich, could provide the &s;upplies; yet what legi&s;|lature ever undertook to levy on <HI>them</HI> more than their ju&s;t proportion. The man of inferior circum&s;tance, is called on for his mite, and a ju&s;t contribution is a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed through the land; and thus would it be in the ca&s;e before us, &s;hould the prices of goods be advanced;
<PB N="68" REF="013760_0068_0F91AA0F7AE9C598">
the rich who con&s;ume the mo&s;t in quantity, and the highe&s;t in price, will con&s;equently pay a proportion &s;uitable to their abilities; and tho&s;e who are the lea&s;t able to pay will always be the &s;malle&s;t cu&s;tomers. But let us &s;uppo&s;e that the prices of goods &s;hould be advanced, that the merchant &s;hould have a bri&s;k &s;ale, and that the conte&s;t between Britain and the colonies &s;hould be &s;uddenly over; ought we not to rejoice that they are gainers by the &s;acrifice they &s;o frankly made, or &s;hall we with avaricious &s;ouls begrudge them the reward of their virtue? They certainly ri&s;que much in the &s;truggle, then why &s;hould we deprive them of the chance of gain? To judge properly on this &s;ub|ject, let every man &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf a vender of goods, and then let him be a&s;ked the que&s;tion, <HI>what part he apprehended the community ought to take in his behalf?</HI></P>
<P>THE only po&s;&s;ible <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> that I can conceive to operate again&s;t taking their &s;ituation into notice, is a <HI>rea&s;on</HI> which I hope we &s;hall never have occa&s;ion to apply.

<P>IN a former number I objected to the mode of ob|taining redre&s;s of our grievances, by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the We&s;t India i&s;lands, but forbore to extend my rea|&s;onings on the &s;ubject, &s;o far as it would bear; flat|tering my&s;elf, that a mea&s;ure that had neither &s;ound policy, nor ju&s;tice, for its &s;upport, would need but

<P>WHILST the mind is diverted from objects of per&s;onal intere&s;t, to the more important affairs of national concern, will it be deemed trea|cherous to &s;eize on it in that unguarded moment, and con&s;ign it a prey to the cau&s;e of virtue; or can the &s;ubject of this paper be thought foreign or imperti|nent, when the que&s;tion in agitation is a que&s;tion of liberty.</P>
<P>TO every principled and virtuous &s;on of freedom I &s;eriou&s;ly appeal, and crave your attention to a &s;ubject united and connected with the common cau&s;e.

<P>GOADED by oppre&s;&s;ion, and urged by the exerti|ons of unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable power, the inhabitants of America have unitedly ri&s;en in a manly and virtu|ous oppo&s;ition. Unawed by the tyranny of imperi|ous rulers we rou&s;e with indignant hearts, and boldly a&s;&s;ert the extent of our rights. Every latent &s;park is drawn forth to enlighten the &s;cene. The clouds of ob&s;curing ignorance are expelled and di&s;per&s;ed, whil&s;t the blaze of human freedom darts far and wide its chearing rays. We trace with enquiring minds the principles of government; we clo&s;ely inve&s;tigate the origin of power, and deduce from unvarying laws that Man the image of his maker&mdash;Man, a little low|er than the angels, has a title, an undoubted title to unlimited freedom, and though the nece&s;&s;ities of civil &s;ociety oblige us, for the conveniencies of life to de|liver up part of the unbounded liberty of our natures, yet this &s;urrender we cautiou&s;ly circum&s;cribe, and mark it within the bounds of public good, by which every individual is protected in his ju&s;t and equal &s;hare. At fir&s;t when the dedications of power are per|verted to the injury of the people, they ri&s;e with jea|lous anger and enquire the cau&s;e; but &s;uch is the depravity of human nature, and the artfulne&s;s of vice, that the very means which were devi&s;ed to &s;ecure and protect, become the engines of de&s;truction. With di&s;cretionary confidence we tru&s;t power in the hands of a few, and the&s;e by a gradual in&s;atiable de&s;ire of unlimited &s;way are, with boundle&s;s pur&s;uits, under|mining the principles of their appointment. Nation after nation have fallen victims to the lu&s;t of power, and the wretched inhabitants can now &s;carcely de&s;cry the ve&s;tiges of freedom.</P>

<P>THE long di&s;putes depending between England and her coloni&s;ts have compelled them into a clo&s;e &s;earch after their natural rights, and as they have re|peatedly declared them in re&s;olves from one end of the continent to the other, I will make bold to take a review of their general &s;entiments of liberty.</P>
<P>NOV. 29th, 1765, the A&s;&s;embly of South Carolina re&s;olve, that his Maje&s;ty's liege &s;ubjects in this pro|vince are entitled to all the inherent rights and liber|ties of his natural born &s;ubjects within the kingdom of Great Britain&mdash;that the increa&s;e, pro&s;perity, and happine&s;s of the <HI>people</HI> of this province depend upon <HI>the full and free enjoyment of their rights and liberties.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="013760_0078_0F91AA1C1137E9C8">SEPT. 28th, 1765, the A&s;&s;embly of Maryland re|&s;olve, that the fir&s;t adventurers and &s;ettlers of this province of Maryland brought with them, and tran&s;|mitted to their po&s;terity, and <HI>all other</HI> his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects &s;ince inhabiting in this province all the liber|ties, privileges, <HI>franchi&s;es,</HI> and immunities that at any time have been held, enjoyed, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the people of Great Britain.</P>
<P>SEPT. 21&s;t, 1765, the A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania re&s;olve, that the <HI>inhabitants</HI> of this province are entit|led to <HI>all the liberties,</HI> rights and privileges of his Ma|je&s;ty's &s;ubjects in Great Britain, or el&s;ewhere, and that the con&s;titution of government in this province is founded on the <HI>natural rights of mankind</HI> and the <HI>noble principles of Engli&s;h liberty,</HI> and therefore is, or <HI>ought to be perfectly free.</HI></P>
<P>DEC. 25th, 1765, at a large and re&s;pectable meet|ing in the colony of Connecticut, for the county of Windham and parts adjacent, they re&s;olve, that <HI>God has by nature given us a right to freedom,</HI> and by &s;o|lemn charter, compact, and agreement made with our forefathers we are, as natural heirs by inheritance, entitled to all the rights and privileges of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, by which our <HI>natural rights</HI> are con|firmed.</P>
<P>SEPT. 16, 1765, the A&s;&s;embly of Rhode-I&s;land re&s;olve, that the fir&s;t adventurers, &s;ettlers of his Ma|je&s;ty's colony and dominion of Rhode-I&s;land and Pro|vidence plantation, brought with them, and tran&s;mit|ted to their po&s;terity, and <HI>all other</HI> his Maje&s;ty's &s;ub|jects &s;ince inhabiting in this his Maje&s;ty's colony, <HI>all the privileges</HI> and immunities that have <HI>at any time</HI> been <HI>held, enjoyed,</HI> and <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the people of Great

<P>OCT. 29, 1765, the A&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay re&s;olve, that there are certain <HI>e&s;&s;ential rights</HI> of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution which are <HI>founded in the law of God and nature,</HI> and are the <HI>common rights of man|kind</HI>; therefore, that the <HI>inhabitants</HI> of this province are <HI>unalienably</HI> entitled to tho&s;e <HI>e&s;&s;ential rights</HI> in <HI>com|mon with</HI> ALL MEN, and NO LAW OF SOCIETY <HI>can, con&s;i&s;tent with the law of God and nature, dive&s;t them of tho&s;e rights.</HI> That his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in Ame|rica are, in rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, entitled to the &s;ame extent of liberty with his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in Great Britain.</P>
<P>THESE &s;everal re&s;olves from South-Carolina to New-England fully indicate the general idea of li|berty, entertained by the coloni&s;ts at the time of the Stamp Act.

rights which
<Q>no law of &s;ociety can con&s;i&s;tently dive&s;t them of.</Q></P>
<P>NOW, my brethren, I will beg leave to come clo&s;e to the point, and call for an examination of our own conduct&mdash;Let us try if it will &s;quare with our preten|&s;ions, whether we can reconcile the <HI>exerci&s;e of</HI> SLA|VERY

In vain &s;hall we contend for <HI>liberty,</HI> as an "<HI>e&s;&s;ential in our con&s;titution,</HI>" till this barbarous inhuman practice is driven from our borders. Let him who claims an exemption from the controul of Parliamentary power, &s;hew to the world, by what right, human or divine, he keeps in cruel &s;lavery his <HI>fellow man.</HI> We declare with a joint voice, that ALL <HI>the inhabitants of America</HI> are entitled to the privileges of the inhabitants of Great-Britain; if &s;o, by what right do we &s;upport &s;lavery?&mdash;the in&s;tant a &s;lave &s;ets his foot in England he claims the protection of the laws, and puts his ma&s;ter at defiance; if Briti&s;h rights extend to Ame|rica, <HI>who</HI> &s;hall detain him in bondage? If his pre|tended owner can &s;hew no per&s;onal contract with the unfortunate African, is there a court on the continent, that would unrighteou&s;ly declare him a &s;lave? You &s;ay you bought them of tho&s;e who had a right to &s;ell.&mdash;I di&s;pute it&mdash;on behalf of the injured Blacks, I di&s;pute it, and call on you to &s;hew your title.

If <HI>force</HI> and <HI>power</HI> are the only important links in the title, what arguments can we advance in <HI>their</HI> favour, which will not militate again&s;t our&s;elves, whil&s;t England remains &s;uperior by land and by &s;ea.</P>
<P>SHALL a climate, a colour, or a country, determine the mi&s;erable inhabitants as &s;laves and va&s;&s;als to the re&s;t of the world; or from what quarter &s;hall we de|rive our rea&s;onings, to prove and &s;upport our tyran|nizing power?&mdash;Is there &s;uch a thing with Engli&s;h|men&mdash;high claiming Engli&s;hmen&mdash;as <HI>partial</HI> liberty? Has the Almighty decreed <HI>us</HI> their ma&s;ters, and de|grading the workman&s;hip of his hands, &s;tamped &s;lave to eternity on their foreheads? By what law has he thus ve&s;ted us with barbarous and cruel &s;way? Is it po&s;&s;ible we can &s;it down in the cool of the day, and laying our hands on our bo&s;oms, &s;ay we believe they were formed for our &s;ervants? On the other hand I would a&s;k, Is there a &s;ingle argument to be adduced in &s;upport of <HI>our</HI> right to their &s;ervices, which would not equally hold in favour of <HI>their</HI> en&s;laving <HI>us,</HI> if we were trepanned into their country? But why need I argue on the point? I cannot con&s;ent to believe that there is a &s;ingle &s;lave holder on the continent, who is from principle a tyrant. Their intere&s;ts are &s;o nearly connected with the &s;ubject, that their judg|ments are mi&s;led. With &s;uch men it is hard to con|tend; their rea&s;on lies buried and concealed; when called forth it appears with reluctance, and urges its efforts with enervated force. Yet many there are in
<PB N="83" REF="013760_0083_0F91AA2431771600">
the &s;everal colonies, who are earne&s;tly concerned in this important cau&s;e.&mdash;To <HI>you,</HI> my brethren&mdash;<HI>you</HI> genuine &s;ons of liberty, they look for &s;upport. Let us &s;et foot to foot and &s;houlder to &s;houlder, to expel this horrid demon from our land.&mdash;How oft is my heart &s;unk into &s;orrowing &s;ympathy with the&s;e poor and unfortunate wretches. When I hear of the brutal cruelties exerci&s;ed over them, by their inhuman own|ers, when I view the&s;e u&s;urpers of human freedom, ba&s;king in the beams of &s;ucce&s;s, and bowling through life with undaunted career, I look up with wondering eye to the great and Almighty Author of our being, and am lo&s;t in contemplating the di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence.</P>
<P>THE noble, &s;pirited and virtuous A&s;&s;embly of Vir|ginia, not long ago petitioned his Maje&s;ty for leave to pa&s;s an act to prohibit the importation of &s;laves, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of humanity; but the petition was rejected. Yet &s;hould the colonies, with their joint voice at the Congre&s;s, make a for|cible remon&s;trance again&s;t the iniquity of the &s;lave trade, it would breathe &s;uch an independant &s;pirit of liberty, and &s;o corroborate our own claims, that I &s;hould dare to hope for an intervening arm of Provi|dence to be extended in our favour. Should the colonies gain permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s prohibitory acts again&s;t future importations, I &s;hould then, with ex|pectant joy, look forward for the glorious dawning of a day of liberty.</P>
<P>UNIMPORTANT as this may &s;eem to &s;ome, I he&s;i|tate not to pronounce, that the true intere&s;ts and wel|fare of America are more intimately connected with it, than with the repeal of every act which now agitates the continent&mdash;<HI>one</HI> we might probably out grow in a

&s;eries of years, but <HI>the other</HI> would "&s;trengthen with our &s;trength," and involve us in endle&s;s perplexities. If a &s;top could be put to the importation, the grand difficulty would be over. Means might &s;oon be de|vi&s;ed to di&s;charge this unhappy race among&s;t us, and wear out the mon&s;trous badge of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. To the Congre&s;s I would earne&s;tly urge this weighty point, and to the internal policy of every govern|ment I would pre&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity of removing every legal ob&s;truction, which &s;tands as a bar to their free|dom. I am unacquainted with the general laws of emancipation in the &s;outhern and the ea&s;tern colo|nies, but tho&s;e of Maryland, Penn&s;ylvania and New- Jer&s;ey have fallen within my knowledge. In the fir&s;t, any &s;lave holder may &s;et his &s;laves at liberty without charge or encumbrance, provided they are not aged or infirm, but in Penn&s;ylvania the law requires a bond of indemnification of thirty pounds, to prevent the &s;lave becoming a burthen to the town&s;hip, and the law is &s;o worded as to admit of a doubt, whether &s;uch bond totally di&s;charges the ma&s;ter's e&s;tate; and in &s;ome ca&s;es the courts, before whom &s;uch emancipation is to be declared, have &s;o far exerted their power, as to refu&s;e admitting the &s;ecurity, though undoubtedly good, and the &s;laves intended for freedom healthy and young; by which means, they were kept in bon|dage again&s;t the inclinations of their owners. In New- Jer&s;ey, the law requires a &s;ecurity of two hundred pounds, but the a&s;&s;embly of that province, at their la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, took up the matter on virtuous principles, and made an e&s;&s;ay towards "<HI>an act for the more equi|table manumi&s;&s;ion of &s;laves,</HI>" by which any per&s;on de|claring his Negro free, before proper authority, at the age of twenty one, may do it without charge or encumbrance, and for every year exceeding that age, the owner &s;o intending to &s;et him free, is to pay in|to

the hands of the over&s;eers of the poor, the &s;um of twenty &s;hillings, which &s;hall be a total di&s;charge: This with a few di&s;cretionary re&s;trictions is publi&s;hed in their votes, for the in&s;pection of their con&s;tituents, and it is hoped by every lover of liberty, that it will pa&s;s into a law at the next &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>WERE the colonies as earne&s;t for the pre&s;ervation of liberty, upon its <HI>true</HI> and <HI>genuine</HI> principles, as they are to oppo&s;e the &s;upremacy of an Engli&s;h par|liament, they would enter into a virtuous and <HI>per|petual</HI> re&s;olve neither to import, nor to purcha&s;e any &s;laves introduced among them after the meeting of the Congre&s;s. A re&s;olve &s;o replete with liberty, &s;o truly noble, would indelibly convey to future ages a memorable record of di&s;intere&s;ted virtue; whil&s;t thou&s;ands, ten thou&s;ands yet unborn, might ble&s;s them in their native &s;hades, carving on the &s;mooth bark of every tree, NOBLE AMERICANS. With grateful hearts might they look up "<HI>to the unknown God,</HI>" and urge this ardent prayer&mdash; <HI>Great and Almighty ruler of the Univer&s;e, &s;how|er down the choice&s;t of thy ble&s;&s;ings on yon we&s;tern climes.</HI></P>
<P>HERE I &s;hall clo&s;e the&s;e reflections, and &s;ubmit them to the candour of my countrymen. If my conceptions of equity, or conjectures on the politi|cal intere&s;ts of the continent, &s;hould differ from many of my brethren, I &s;hall open my heart to conviction, and &s;tand a willing convert to the voice of rea&s;on.
