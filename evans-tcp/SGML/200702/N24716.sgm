<P>YOUR la&s;t, containing an account of your perfect recovery, met a cordial recep|tion. Upon this happy occa&s;ion, deare&s;t Maria, accept the &s;incere congratulations of my affec|tionate heart.&mdash;I am tempted almo&s;t to envy you the dear object of your &s;ublime rapture:&mdash;the rapture of a young mother in gazing on the offspring of her early love. From your own plea&s;ing emotions you may now partly conceive

the comparative agony of mine, on the prema|ture lo&s;s of my only darling child! That heaven|ly babe, who&s;e infant &s;miles even now live in my memory; who&s;e little heart &s;eemed already to beat and glow with &s;entiments of virtue and ho|nor; who&s;e li&s;ping accents &s;oothed the cen&s;ure of its father's tongue, and gave a comfort to mater|nal woe, was, in a very fla&s;h of thought, &s;natched from my doating eyes; his lips for ever &s;ealed; his &s;oul tran&s;ported to the &s;hades of innocence and bli&s;s; leaving me a &s;olitary monument of his worth, by the bitter con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his lo&s;s! Oh! how &s;everely trying was this tremendous conflict of tender, weeping nature, with stern philo&s;ophic rea&s;on and calm religion! Oh Maria, prepare your heart for trials even as dreadful as mine! Life it&s;elf, all its enjoyments, hang on the flying winds; and the gentle&s;t gale may, by Almighty di&s;pen&s;ation, become the dreadful me&s;|&s;enger of de&s;truction! Even that &s;miling infant, now opening to your &s;anguine expectation, mu&s;t one day yield the precious life it breathes; and we our&s;elves experience an agele&s;s interval of love and friend&s;hip!&mdash;Forgive the&s;e calamitous anticipations: May heaven continue &s;upremely good and bountiful; for ever withholding from your experience the mi&s;eries of which your un|happy &s;i&s;ter complains.</P>

WE have but ju&s;t recovered from the labour and fatigue of removing to our newly-purcha&s;ed country-&s;eat. The de&s;cription of it given by Mr. Franks, did not in reality exceed the rural beau|ty and magnificence of the &s;cene to which we have retired for the approaching &s;ea&s;on. The dwelling-hou&s;e is advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated on a delightful green hill, which, be&s;ides looking over an exten&s;ive and beautiful country, adds a pecu|liar grandeur and variety to the approximate &s;cenery. The rooms and balcony in the front are entirely &s;haded by a row of willows, who&s;e drooping bows, moved by the gentle breeze, &s;eem to wave in zephyrous mu&s;ic to the victim of &s;olitude and grief. In &s;uch a &s;eclu&s;ion, ble&s;&s;|ed with the &s;ociety of &s;ome feeling friend, or the livelier conver&s;ation of you, Maria, what a period of divine luxury would be the en&s;uing &s;ummer! But alas! this rural elegance, this mild "fancy of nature's hand-maid," only imparts bitterness to the reflection of my being deprived of such a companion to participate in this ex|pencele&s;s grandeur.</P>
<P>THE &s;urrounding country is con&s;iderably in|habited by indu&s;trious indigence. Within a few acres of us there is a man&s;ion, in appearance the perfect twin of ours, the property of a mer|chant
<PB N="16" REF="032746_0014_0FF4F88A82FE6350">
of eminence in Philadelphia, named Al|fred, who&s;e family has retired thither from the noi&s;e and tumult of the city, to &s;pend the ap|proaching &s;ummer. It con&s;i&s;ts only of Mrs. Alfred, a polite old lady, an amiable daughter (Mi&s;s Fanny,) and a &s;on, whom I have not yet &s;een: From the mother and daughter I have al|ready received &s;everal flattering marks of com|plai&s;ance, and have occa&s;ion to wi&s;h for a &s;peedy intimacy. Mi&s;s Alfred, now about her twenty &s;econd year, has a romantic attachment, and principally delights to ramble, ju&s;t as the &s;un dives into the we&s;t, among the &s;ilent rocks, li&s;tening to the mingled noi&s;e of wooing birds, and the echoes which a&s;cend from the adjacent vales. She de|clares it is an intellectual repa&s;t exceeding de&s;|cription; and at her particular reque&s;t, I am &s;oon to be a partner in one of her evening ram|bles.</P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide of us &s;tands an ancient and mouldering edifice, in which, I under&s;tand, three maiden &s;i&s;ters re&s;ide during the &s;ultrine&s;s of the year. I received a notice from them this morn|ing of their intention to &s;pend the afternoon with us: In my next, therefore, you &s;hall have a particular account of the&s;e antiquated virgins.</P>

FROM this you will perceive that all my expec|tations of &s;ociety, while ab&s;ent from the city, are on the Alfred family; and although this limita|tion at pre&s;ent proves unwelcome, I anticipate a variety of plea&s;ures from the frequent vi&s;its of the intelligent Mi&s;s Alfred.</P>

<P>I CONFESS, dear Maria, the truth of many of the remarks communicated in your la&s;t; though &s;ome of them, permit me to &s;ay, &s;avoured too &s;trongly of the turgid &s;tiffne&s;s of con&s;cientious &s;anctity. No one, however, more truly chorded with my &s;entiments and feelings than that "the endearing care&s;&s;es of a fond hu&s;|band
<PB N="18" REF="032746_0016_0FF4F89505782968">
ought to fill up every wi&s;h and de&s;ire of an affectionate wife, even immured in a wilder|ne&s;s, far from the fanta&s;tic plea&s;ures of a tin&s;ell|ed world." Than this, what more delightful fruition could a virtuous woman de&s;ire? But, oh, my &s;i&s;ter, have you already forgotten the sad nece&s;&s;ity of my union with Mr. Franks?&mdash;You, to whom fortune has invariably proved so mu|nificent, &s;hould, if not forgive the aberrances of the more unfortunate, at lea&s;t lament the uncon|&s;cious origin of them. There is a &s;upernatural &s;atiety exi&s;ting in the female &s;oul;&mdash;the con&s;um|mation of ineffable love, without which the mo&s;t ardent feelings of the heart, the mo&s;t re&s;plen|dent faculties of the mind, are left unexerci&s;ed and torpid. You, my lovely Maria, feel your bo&s;om hourly &s;welling with the cele&s;tial glow of a pure and cea&s;ele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion; how then can you competently judge of the &s;ecret emotions of a &s;i&s;ter, chained by tyrant cu&s;tom to a man who never avowed more than a motive of expediency for his addre&s;&s;es, who has ever neglected the of|fices of a hu&s;band, and for whom, even now I declare, I never felt more than e&s;teem? The &s;i|lent a&s;hes of that deluded father who&s;e power coerced me to the deed, &s;leep over the endle&s;s torments which his ra&s;hne&s;s has produced!&mdash;And mu&s;t I, in meek &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a hardened,

&s;en&s;ele&s;s world, oppo&s;e the in&s;tinctive impul&s;e of my &s;oul? Mu&s;t I, to gratify the caprice of a world who&s;e cen&s;ure or applau&s;e is alike de&s;pic|able, dam up the current of my thoughts, or cut &s;hort the thread of mental reflection? Can I re|&s;train or limit the involuntary a&s;pirations of my heart? In &s;hort, is it po&s;&s;ible for me to affect a placidity of mind, when the humble&s;t in&s;ect I behold vaunts of its &s;uperior ble&s;&s;edne&s;s? For heaven's &s;ake then, Maria, &s;uppre&s;s your cruel reprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not have replied &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately to this part of your letter, had I not fancied there was too much gaul and acrimony in the ink with which you penned it. A heavy frown &s;eemed to hang on every line, and each ambiguous word to my ears and eyes conveyed horror and appre|&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE expected vi&s;it from my ancient neigh|bours was &s;uddenly and &s;trangely interpo&s;ed. About noon a heavy cloud emerging from the we&s;t, occa&s;ioned a &s;mart &s;hower of rain, accom|panied with mo&s;t tremendous peals of thunder. The valley beneath us &s;eemed to retain the hoar&s;e explo&s;ion; and every clap from heaven was an&s;wered by the &s;harp echo of the trembling
<PB N="20" REF="032746_0018_0FF4F89A57CF5640">
earth, making the convul&s;ed air the theatre of an horrific conflict! At about three in the after|noon it entirely &s;ub&s;ided; and the bright &s;un|beams, breaking through the &s;cattered clouds, di&s;played to the admiring world the arched &s;ce|nery of the rain-bow in all its re&s;plendent glory.&mdash;I expected this circum&s;tance, &s;o &s;alubrious in its influence on the air, would have created a new inducement for my expected vi&s;itants to per|form their engagement; but at near four, I was <HI>officially</HI> informed, "that the Mi&s;s Haywords, apprehen&s;ive that the air was dangerou&s;ly impreg|nated with &s;ulphurous and other offen&s;ive matter, begged to defer their vi&s;it until a more favorable evening. I readily accepted the apology; not, however, without &s;miling at the ab&s;urd caution which had produced it.</P>
<P>I MUST briefly bid farewell, as I overhear the obliging Mi&s;s Alfred in the parlour below. Hea|ven take you in its care!</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR MARIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>DO not, I be&s;eech you, wilfully mi&s;|conceive me:&mdash;what I expre&s;&s;ed in my la&s;t were the matured effu&s;ions of my oppre&s;&s;ed bo&s;om, and they have lo&s;t no &s;trength by the &s;ub&s;equent retro&s;pection. But oh, how unintentionally kind is my fair Mi&s;s Alfred, in intermitting the utter|ance of my grief, by the exhilirating emotions of friend&s;hip. She increa&s;es hourly in my e&s;teem, and has already flattered me with a great portion of her confidence. On concluding my la&s;t epi&s;|tle, I met her in the lower parlour, impatient, as &s;he &s;aid, to take a round of di&s;covery through the adjacent wilderne&s;s in my company. I &s;lip|ped on my &s;hawl and chearfully complied with her requi&s;ition. We walked for two hours, in|dulging in a variety of flippant plea&s;ures; while our a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration paced with each other, on di&s;covering &s;o many objects of beauty and grandeur, cloi&s;tered from the world's eye by almo&s;t impenetrable &s;hrubbery and immen&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="032746_0020_0FF4F8A1675B2260">
ho&s;ts of oak and hickory. We traver&s;ed through thorns, briars, brambles, &amp;c. a&s;cended &s;teep and craggy rocks, forded pellucid &s;treams and chry&s;|tal rivulets, with a labour that lo&s;t its fatigue in the thoughts and enjoyment of each other's com|pany. At times we varied our amu&s;ement by a frolick&s;ome race down &s;ome verdant hill, and then, at the foot, where a cooling &s;tream gurgled to our panting brea&s;ts, we refre&s;hed our&s;elves by catching the fragrant zephyrs that i&s;&s;ued from the adjacent plains.</P>
<P>As we returned, now &s;aid my mirthful com|panion, I will lead you to the Cavern of Medita|tion; with which, taking my hand, &s;he conduct|ed me through a &s;hady valley, which appeared to be formed by the familiar junction of two large rocks, both fancifully carpetted with a green sur|face. Having pa&s;&s;ed this, we entered an appa|rently &s;pacious hall, paved by a &s;tone which had acquired a moderate &s;moothne&s;s from the flow of a &s;tream, which had lately been impeded.&mdash;"That, &s;aid Mi&s;s Alfred, pointing to an opening in the oppo&s;ite rock, is the entrance to my &s;olemn retreat, where, unheard but by the callous &s;tone, which returns a &s;ympathi&s;ing echo, I &s;oothe the rigorous edge of reflection."&mdash;I expre&s;&s;ed an apprehen&s;ion of danger from ven|turing

She in&s;tantly led me to this gloomy avenue, in the middle of which, we were nominally benighted; but my fair guide, groping, at length brought me to her favorite &s;pot, where I beheld a natural &s;o|pha excavated from the rocks, beautifully lined with a green turf. It is of a &s;emi-circular form, and at each &s;ide of the &s;opha, a purling &s;tream which runs from the precipice and buries it&s;elf in an un&s;een ba&s;on below, creates a prattling mu&s;ic congenial to the &s;olemn a&s;pect of the &s;cene, and to a mind tempered for melancholic medita|tion&mdash;"Here, exclaimed my companion, with a vehemence before unob&s;erved, here, deare&s;t ma|dam, it is that I review the &s;hort &s;ea&s;on of life I have yet pa&s;&s;ed, and enumerate the comparative million of my di&s;a&s;ters!

She replied, "Dear madam, excu&s;e me from complying with your reque&s;t at this time. Come, let us leave the &s;pot, and at &s;ome hour when I can more controul the influence of feeling, you &s;hall know the occa|&s;ion of this inordinate &s;orrow."&mdash;I did all in my power to allay the &s;en&s;ible angui&s;h of her heart; and after recovering from our fatigue, by a few moments repo&s;e on the &s;opha, and more minute|ly inspecting the rude magnificence of the dwell|ing, we retired in the &s;ame manner as we had en|tered. On again coming, I may &s;ay to the face of the earth, we di&s;covered the &s;un had laid deep in the We&s;t, and left only a &s;ilver tint on the op|po&s;ite fore&s;ts.

<P>THE affectionate &s;ociety of this charming girl, is a trea&s;ure unexpected in this rude and uncul|tivated wilderne&s;s. Oh it is a heavenly, raptur|ous fruition, of which only &s;ouls &s;u&s;ceptible of the la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip can conceive or partake.</P>

Mr. Franks, with a politene&s;s not peculiar to him, offered to conduct her home. As &s;oon as they had departed, I was imperceptibly led to re|flect on the &s;ingular and affecting circum&s;tance of the cavern, in the recollection of which all my original &s;ympathy was excited. "Is it po&s;&s;i|ble," exclaimed I, traver&s;ing the hall, "that one &s;o young and fair, &s;o mildly innocent and endear|ing, &s;hould already wear in her heart, the cor|roding cau&s;e of this pathetic conduct!&mdash;But ah, why do I wonder this, when youth, beauty, and innocence are the choice&s;t victims of artifice and guilt!&mdash;Oh, what a benevolent curio&s;ity have I to know the hi&s;tory of her tears! To &s;oothe their torture by admini&s;tering &s;ympathy!"&mdash;Thus I employed upwards of an hour, when Mr. Franks returning, a&s;&s;ured me that the fair Mi&s;s Alfred became much indi&s;po&s;ed in the cour&s;e of their walk; and that on leaving her, &s;he had repaired to her bed. Think, my &s;i&s;ter, how this intelli|gence &s;tartled me, con&s;cious as I felt, that the &s;ad circum&s;tance mu&s;t be attributed to &s;ome im|prudence of ye&s;terday.

As &s;oon as we had dined, my girl Hannah, (Mr. Franks declining to accompany me) and I, cro&s;&s;ed the fields and woodland which divide our plantation from the Alfred's, and &s;oon arriv|ed at the front of their man&s;ion hou&s;e.

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will no doubt be a&s;toni&s;hed at the acknowledgement, that your la&s;t, containing a panegyric on the fair, met a cordial acquie&s;|cence in my heart. Con&s;idering my pa&s;t apa|thy, and, I might almo&s;t add, di&s;gu&s;t for the &s;ex, is it not miraculous, that at the mere glance of a female, my callou&s;ed nature has been melted into unbounded adoration?&mdash;Yes, Bill, I have but ju&s;t di&s;covered that the finer faculties of my &s;oul have heretofore been ob&s;cured by &s;chola&s;tic precepts and fal&s;e rea&s;oning; and that, in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing the mild influence and dominion of beauty and innocence, nature de&s;igned the heart <HI>to love,</HI> and formed it for intellectual fruition: In fine, that "nature is the god of love."</P>
<P>THUS you perceive, in fidelity to our juvenile engagement, (made in our chamber, when, per|haps, we &s;hould have been hammering at the problems of Euclid,) I have made an immediate di&s;clo&s;ure of the fir&s;t operations of Cupid on my heart:&mdash;perhaps it is premature; but when I compare my &s;en&s;ations and de&s;ires with tho&s;e of
<PB N="31" REF="032746_0029_0FF4F8BFB48D23E8">
which I have read in the examples of renowned lovers, I am &s;truck with the apparent parallel, and already fore&s;ee a thou&s;and ob&s;tacles to the con&s;ummation of my hopes; a thou&s;and difficul|ties to &s;urmount, and as many dangers to en|counter. Nay, I &s;ometimes fancy my&s;elf the Don Quixotte of my mi&s;tre&s;s; and in my imagin|ary perils, fall an heroic victim to the queen of plea&s;ures!</P>
<P>MY father's farm is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all that ruralic beauty of which are led to conceive by peru&s;ing the hi&s;tory of the loves of enamoured &s;wains and &s;hepherde&s;&s;es. Nature has adorned it with a variety of exqui&s;ite groves, grottos, &amp;c. who&s;e un&s;een retirement &s;eems peculiarly de&s;tined for a reciprocal interchange of hearts. From tho&s;e I have &s;elected one, &s;uited mo&s;t to my temper of mind and conception of wild elegance, to which I have been accu&s;tomed to withdraw in the even|ing of each day, and with my haut-boy play to the gradual fall of the &s;un. It was in the la&s;t exerci&s;e of this diurnal amu&s;ement that I was in|terrupted by the appearance of a female, &s;tand|ing on an eminence exactly oppo&s;ite, who&s;e &s;e|rene and heavenly countenance broke through the interwoven leaves and mollified my unwary heart. She appeared engaged in a carele&s;s re|view

of the &s;urrounding pro&s;pect.

Methinks, at that moment I could have rendered the powers of Orpheus, had I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, the &s;ervants of a chival|rous purpo&s;e!&mdash;Her eyes wandered to di&s;cover the concealed mu&s;ician; but the thick clu&s;ter of the trees, added to the fal&s;e echo of the di&s;tant rocks, deluded her eagere&s;t &s;crutiny; till at length, finding it impracticable, &s;he moved&mdash;and by my &s;oul, I had not the &s;en&s;e or the pow|er to follow her; but, changing the tune, kept mu&s;ic to the maje&s;ty of her &s;teps, till the view of her beauty was buried in the di&s;tant fore&s;t. Yet even now her graces live in the memory of my eyes; and I mentally gaze on her bewitching charms! But, alas! this is all&mdash;all I dare expect! Who &s;he is, from whence, or to where, is a pro|found my&s;tery, which keeps my imagination on the rack! She cannot be of this part of the coun|try, or &s;urely my cars would have heard the <HI>"rumour of her beauty,"</HI> before my eyes were call|ed to witne&s;s it's power, and my heart to avow its dominion.

<P>FROM the extraordinary de&s;cription you have drawn of this unknown female, I was at fir&s;t prompted to conclude, that, in&s;tead of loving an <HI>hand&s;ome woman,</HI> you are no more than paying a dutiful adoration to &s;ome <HI>cele&s;tial being;</HI> who, in the peculiar humour of the &s;ex, had made a trip to this &s;ublunary world to ambu&s;h your af|fections; and, having accompli&s;hed your con|que&s;t, has returned to her ely&s;ium, leaving you the victim of a pa&s;&s;ion hopele&s;s as the grave.

While &s;ome, practi&s;ing on the other &s;ex the devices by which they de&s;troy us, enjoy the ta&s;tele&s;s plea&s;ures of vanity and pride, others are the devoted offerings to artifice and &s;in!

Yes, my Ma|ria, young, fair, and captivating as is Mi&s;s Al|fred, the world,&mdash;that world whom you would have me reverence,&mdash;the unju&s;t, the &s;elfi&s;h, cru|el world, even in her infancy, da&s;hed her hopes of human felicity!&mdash;Oh, that I could equal, in the &s;tyle of narration, the exqui&s;ite angui&s;h of my friend's life, as it &s;treamed from her melting tongue; that my &s;i&s;ter might weep over the hi&s;|tory in all the luxury of wounded &s;en&s;ibility!</P>
<P>I HAVE already mentioned the endearing cha|racter of Mi&s;s Alfred's mother: Her father, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s requires his con&s;tant attention in the city, is not le&s;s affectionate.

From her in|fancy, the&s;e fond parents anticipated the mo&s;t unbounded joy for their decline of life, from be|holding and promoting the felicity of their daugh|ter; and, in the abominable practice of the world, but with this fond hope impre&s;&s;ed, they had, before &s;he attained her ninth year, nominally
<PB N="39" REF="032746_0037_0FF4F8D9DBA11EC0">
united her to a neighbour's &s;on, then about twelve years of age. Full of the bright view of their di&s;tant bli&s;s, to ari&s;e from this parental pre|de&s;tination, &s;he was &s;ent to a celebrated &s;emina|nary, to receive every po&s;&s;ible accompli&s;hment and ornament of education. Here, my Fanny confe&s;&s;es, &s;he enjoyed the undefinable happine&s;s of youthful innocence unfettered by rigid moral|ity or &s;uper&s;titious prejudice. "Here", as &s;he exclaimed in her narration, "here were all my tranquil days enjoyed; the remainder are filled with &s;ighs, and tears, and agony!"&mdash;</P>
<P>HAVING received an education highly adapted to her &s;tation, &s;he left this abode of peace and virtue; and returned to the affectionate care of her fond parents. There &s;he was early intro|duced into the &s;ociety of both the &s;exes; and from the natural &s;weetne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, and acquired elegance of mind, early engaged the admiration and e&s;teem of the one, while the &s;ame qualities excited the envy and malice of her own. Forgetful of the rigid cu&s;toms of the world,&mdash;of the preordination of her parents; and impelled by her own innate &s;entiments of virtue and propriety, her &s;usceptible heart was gradually devoted to the love of a youth, who, though inferior in fortune, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;uperior

endowments of an amiable mind, and a heart un|con&s;cious to every impul&s;e but that of truth and honor. This circum&s;tance gave an a&s;perity to the conduct of her father; who, in the com|mon fatal error of mankind, endeavoured to give a different direction to the affections of his child. "Nay," &s;he exclaimed, "my deare&s;t fa|ther, forgetful of his nature, was on this occa&s;ion even cruel!"&mdash;In the fir&s;t vehemence of his pa|ternal concern, he &s;ucceeded in &s;eparating this lovely pair, by prevailing with the father of Mr. Wellsford, (the youth before mentioned) to di&s;|patch him as &s;upercargo to the Ea&s;t-Indies; where he has been almo&s;t five years, without communicating the lea&s;t intelligence to his fami|ly, or to the more unhappy Fanny. "Oh," &s;he &s;ighed, "I am &s;ure he is no more! His &s;pirit was too noble to bend long to the ba&s;ene&s;s and perfidy of mankind! It has fled to its nativity; from whence it &s;hall hover round my mind, till both are re-united in perfect bli&s;s!"</P>
<P>SEVERELY as my Fanny mu&s;t have experienc|ed this odious tyranny, its effects were not &s;o baneful or la&s;ting, as tho&s;e of the di&s;a&s;ter which &s;ucceeded.

the defamation. Her former a&s;&s;ociates &s;uddenly withdrew them&s;elves from her intima|cy; and the number of her male admirers as &s;uddenly increa&s;ed, drawn by the rumour of her wantonne&s;s. Thus fouly traduced and contemn|ed, while her un&s;u&s;pecting heart was devoted to love and con&s;tancy; her deare&s;t and only com|forter arbitrarily exiled; and with feelings ever alive to acute impre&s;&s;ions, a violent malady, of both mind and body, &s;ucceeded; and but for the timely revival of her father's affection, and the tender &s;olicitude of her mother, would have a&s;&s;uredly proved fatal: but by their joint efforts the trembling thread of life was &s;trengthened, and her pa&s;&s;ion, di&s;daining the con&s;tructions of a treacherous world, retired to this &s;eat of inno|cence, dedicating tears of pity to the frailty of mankind, and invoking on her bani&s;hed Henry the collected ble&s;&s;ings of an approving God!&mdash;Her father has perceived, by the &s;ad experience of his child, the repugnance to true happine&s;s of coercion or re&s;traint in the concerns of the heart; and endeavours, by a cour&s;e of fondne&s;s and at|tention, to era&s;e from the annals of her mind the painful recollection of her &s;ufferings.</P>

<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE the receipt of your obliging favor of the&mdash;in&s;t. on which day, perhaps even while your generous pen was freely flowing to my relief, my &s;anguine hopes experienced the mo&s;t poignant mortification.&mdash;Yes, my worthy friend, my early pa&s;&s;ion has al|ready opened on it&s;elf the &s;luices of di&s;tre&s;s, and

at pre&s;ent I am &s;o overwhelmed with the agony of reflection, that I am con&s;cious of my inability to relate the &s;urpri&s;ing occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>ON concluding my la&s;t to you, which was written early on the morning &s;ub&s;equent to my entanglement, I had recour&s;e to my gun, expect|ing by an hour of exerci&s;e to bani&s;h the melan|choly pen&s;ivene&s;s which in&s;idiou&s;ly gained on my mind. I traver&s;ed the exten&s;ive woodlands without having occa&s;ion once to di&s;charge my gun; and was returning home, when the &s;udden report of a mu&s;quet from a thicket at my &s;ide, &s;o &s;tartled me, that my finger, then on the tryger, by the quick emotion of my fright, in&s;tantly let &s;ly the whole contents of the piece into the bo&s;om of the ambu&s;h from which the former had i&s;&s;ued. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive frights kept me &s;ilently amazed for &s;ome time; till, thinking of the probable dan|ger of my random &s;hot, I entered into the thic|ket, and my a&s;toni&s;hment was increa&s;ed by there beholding a gentleman in&s;en&s;ibly extended on the ground, with a mu&s;quet carele&s;sly fallen at his &s;ide. Certain that this was the effect of the la&s;t accident, I rai&s;ed him from his laying po&s;ture, and was relieved by ob&s;erving that the &s;hot had but &s;lightly grazed his left &s;houlder and cheek; and that his &s;en&s;es were partly re&s;tored. After a
<PB N="44" REF="032746_0042_0FF4F8E8973BDC58">
&s;hort &s;ilence, he looked me in the face and en|quired if I was hurt, to which having replied in the negative, I al&s;o accounted for the accident by which he had been reduced to his pre&s;ent condi|tion.&mdash;He begged that I would not apologize: He had been out the whole morning, he &s;aid, without meeting any game, till pa&s;&s;ing through this clu&s;ter of &s;hrubbery, a &s;quirrel &s;tarting, he carele&s;sly let fly at him, not thinking of the dan|ger. He then directed me to his dwelling, a few acres from my father's, and pre&s;&s;ed me to pay him a vi&s;it that afternoon. Promi&s;ing to oblige him, I returned home and found the family at break|fa&s;t; for which, alas, thought had robbed me of an appetite!</P>
<P>THE remainder of the morning I employed in a moral contemplation of the &s;apient Seneca; and, after a tolerable dinner, departed to fulfil my early engagement&mdash;But oh, my friend, how lit|tle did my forebodings predict the event!&mdash;I was in&s;en&s;ible to every external object around me, till entering a &s;hady covert in the wood, how I came there I know not, my amazed eyes beheld the fair object of my meditation repo&s;ing on a green turf, beautifully &s;haded by &s;everal young walnut trees, and partly &s;urrounded by a circle of &s;weet briers! I &s;tood for a moment ab&s;olutely petrified,

undetermined whether to enjoy a &s;tolen glance or retreat from the holy &s;eclu&s;ion. Love and hope impelled me to the fir&s;t; and on advancing I perceived an open book ju&s;t &s;lipping from her tender hold, which having &s;ecured, think, my friend, in all the imagery of your glowing fancy, of the tran&s;ported attitude in which I gazed on this &s;leeping godde&s;s, as uncon&s;cious then of my pa&s;&s;ion as I am of the pre&s;ent emotions of her &s;oul!&mdash;Now with my eyes eagerly revitted to the mild beauties of her face; nay, even glancing on the white innocence of her heaving bo&s;om, and then, rai&s;ed in &s;ilent extacy to heaven!&mdash;I almo&s;t forget my&s;elf in this mute rhap&s;ody, and but for the fear of offending, would &s;urely have continued in this exerci&s;e till &s;he awoke; but prudence and re&s;pect drove me from her pre|&s;ence; and with a heart highly elated, I arrived at the dwelling of my new acquaintance, who received me into a &s;pacious parlour with all the cordiality of politene&s;s; a&s;&s;uring me that he was recovered from the fright as well as the injury of the morning. He is a gentleman con&s;iderably advanced in years, and in the cur&s;ory conver&s;ation of an hour di&s;played a great intelligence in hi&s;to|rical facts, and a knowledge of reigning politics, which he made the theme of our di&s;cour&s;e.

How I appeared I know not, but till the period of departing I was &s;en&s;ible of nothing but the mi&s;ery of my condition.

<HEAD>LETTER IX. To MR. CHARLES ALFRED.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>BALTIMORE.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR CHARLES,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALREADY, as I at fir&s;t predicted, your life commences with eccentric incidents; and I &s;eriou&s;ly apprehend, that, like your bre|thren of the loving fraternity, you are al&s;o de&s;|tined to experience the irrevocable alternations of bli&s;s and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THE fortuitous di&s;covery you have recently made is &s;o important, that a &s;tranger would &s;up|po&s;e your love as well as your hope would ex|pire at the knowledge you have obtained of the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s: Yet at the &s;ame time, your pa&s;&s;ion, in &s;urviving this tremendous &s;hock, evinces its nature to be genuine and &s;incere; and con&s;equently, in my humble opinion, can be denominated no other than virtuous. Love can never be vicious. Taking the term in its literal definition, it is an emotion of the &s;oul which ever is the &s;pring and motive of action to|wards the beloved object. Being in its nature a &s;entiment of good-will, and a &s;econdary principle of &s;elf-love, its generous &s;treams retain their ori|ginal
<PB N="49" REF="032746_0047_0FF4F8FE273746B0">
&s;anctity; and therefore, even in its mo&s;t unbounded inundations (if the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed) guilt is not ju&s;tly attached: though fa&s;hionable and general in&s;titutions dogmatically limit its operation; fix the boundary of its influ|ence, and &s;ay, "Thus far, and no farther &s;halt thou go."</P>
<P>SURELY your own feelings will corroborate the opinion, that it is a pa&s;&s;ion too omni&s;cient, too arbitrary, to &s;ubmit to the controul of human laws, which often are the offspring of avarice and pride:&mdash;That, notwith&s;tanding the cu&s;toms of the world, a beautiful and amiable <HI>wife</HI> will as effectually entrap the affections of an unguard|ed bo&s;om, as the &s;ame attractions would in the per&s;on of an unplighted <HI>maid.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the preceding, my friend, you will per|ceive, how exactly parallel with your pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances, my &s;peculations on this &s;ubject have always been. Moreover, I affirm, that, rea&s;on|ing from human nature, it is as impo&s;&s;ible to pre|vent a refined and &s;u&s;ceptible heart from admir|ing an amiable and beautiful woman, either mar|ried or &s;ingle, as it would be to annihilate any natural appetite of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="032746_0048_0FF4F8FFB3BA4388">
HAVING &s;o explicitly avowed this &s;entiment, which, by many, will be deemed that of a liber|tine, I cannot refrain &s;ugge&s;ting the nece&s;&s;ity and expediency of reining your pa&s;&s;ion with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection; as we are in our actions more &s;ubordinate to the laws of the world, than to the deci&s;ions of our own individual minds. Hence, at the &s;ame time to conform to the prac|tice of the world, and yet to indulge in repug|nant propen&s;ities, &s;hould be the ince&s;&s;ant &s;tudy of a man, hurried, as you are, into the perils of an illegal amour. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s you expe|rience of the purity of your pa&s;&s;ion, would, no doubt, unbia&s;&s;ed by fear, induce you to di&s;clo&s;e it to the object;&mdash;but, Charles, this will not do; we are not living in a &s;tate of nature; and I will add, that even &s;hould your wi&s;hes meet a reci|procity of affection, that &s;acred boon mu&s;t be il|licit, and all its con&s;equent raptures devoted to lence and retirement.</P>
<P>&mdash;YOUR predicament is indeed extremely &s;ingular and momentous!&mdash;'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, you &s;ay, to extirpate your affection: I believe it, from my &s;oul. Love, having once engrafted it&s;elf, can only be exterminated by the total extinction of its &s;ource; that is, the heart.&mdash;Yet alas! Look at the big horror which &s;wells the eye of antici|pation!

<P>YOU know it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to conceal a &s;ingle thought from your genero&s;ity. It is your kindne&s;s which unloo&s;es the bandages of my bo&s;om, and your pity which allays the up|roar of my grief! In you I have always found a friend to flatter my virtues, and a &s;i&s;ter happy in correcting my vices; the la&s;t, I tru&s;t, have been the unavoidable effects of my fir&s;t and ear|ly mi&s;fortune.&mdash;Yet why need I endeavour to al|leviate my own angui&s;h, by diffu&s;ing its influence, and embittering, by a poignant &s;ympathy, the pure and tranquil joys of which my amiable Ma|ria partakes, and to which her &s;plendid goodne&s;s entitles her! Oh, my &s;i&s;ter, but for the certainty that your affection delights in the work of mer|cy, my woe-worn heart &s;hould be the limits of its own di&s;tre&s;s: Yea, bur&s;t with plenitude of grief, ere by di&s;clo&s;ing it, impart one unwelcome &s;igh or move a repugnant throb in the tranquil bo&s;om of my &s;i&s;ter! Melancholy's di&s;ea&s;e and "&s;adne&s;s dire" &s;hould devour my frame; till gliding into

an immen&s;e eternity, my &s;ad memory, and my woes &s;hall &s;leep together in a breathle&s;s grave!</P>
<P>OH, Maria, how keen, how exqui&s;itely di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing are my pre&s;ent &s;en&s;ations! My hu&s;band&mdash;(alas, the revered name allied to him is profana|tion!) has ju&s;t left me in a paroxi&s;m of frenzy! As I write I tremble at the recollection of his words! My heart heaves the oppre&s;&s;ive &s;igh, and all my faculties are &s;tupified by the domi|nion of terror; yet believe me, it is a mild for|getfulne&s;s of grief, an intermi&s;&s;ion of woe, thus in friend&s;hip to avow my &s;ecret reflections.</P>
<P>A FEW days pa&s;t, having no rea&s;on to expect the &s;ociety of Mi&s;s Alfred, I left the hou&s;e early in the afternoon, to loiter away the tedious time; and, if po&s;&s;ible, forget the wretchedne&s;s of my &s;ituation, by devoting my mind to a pious admi|ration of the beauties and ble&s;&s;ings of nature.&mdash;The air was attuned to pen&s;ivene&s;s; the bound|le&s;s canopy of heaven's etherial blue was varied only by a few &s;cattered fleecy-clouds; the &s;un &s;hone in its milde&s;t &s;plendour, from who&s;e in|fluence the branches of innumerable trees con|cealed a meandering foot-path; the concert of birds, fearle&s;sly fri&s;king on the ground, complet|ed the &s;cene of magnificence and peace through
<PB N="60" REF="032746_0058_0FF4F91FF1C9B658">
which I wandered. At length, after a tedious circuit, I arrived at the grotto, to which, with a book, I have u&s;ually repaired in the moments of mental affliction. Here, reclining on the &s;oft bo&s;om of the earth, I retraced the pathetic epi&s;|tles of Eloi&s;a, till I became entranced in a gentle &s;lumber. Oh, Maria, in this &s;hort interval of life, (for &s;uch it may be called, as in it I forgot my relation to the world) a benignant ray of bli&s;s fla&s;hed through my perturbed bo&s;om; and even when returned to this "vale of tears," the re|collection of fancied joy di&s;&s;u&s;ed a momentary happine&s;s.&mdash;The volume, which for once had been my opiate, had di&s;appeared, by what &s;uper|natural means I was unable to di&s;cover. Alarm|ed at this circum&s;tance, I precipitately left the place and hurried home; where, entering ab|ruptly, I found Mr. Franks in conver&s;ation with a young gentleman, a &s;tranger, till he was an|nounced to me as Mr. Alfred, brother to my in|valuable friend. On his introduction he exhibit|ed a peculiar degree of youthful mode&s;ty and embara&s;&s;ment; which was, no doubt, heighten|ed by the abrupt manner of my entrance, and the con&s;equent incoherence of my manners. It was not long, however, before he aro&s;e to depart; when, de&s;iring to be remembered to his &s;i&s;ter, we both accompanied him through the hall to the
<PB N="61" REF="032746_0059_0FF4F925D324BDD8">
door, at which, as he cro&s;&s;ed the platform, I re|marked to Mr. Franks, with no other de&s;ign than to plea&s;e him by an innocent compliment on his young acquaintance, that nature appeared partial to this happy family, in lavi&s;hing on its children, the accompli&s;hments of mind and per|&s;on. Oh, luckle&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">! It &s;prung invo|luntary from my heart: It was but an harmle&s;s &s;park of that general affection which had been conceived for the whole family, by a knowledge of the merits of Mi&s;s Alfred!&mdash;But the cruelty of my hu&s;band replied with this uncouth cen|&s;ure:&mdash;" Cur&s;e on the vanity of your heart! Be|cau&s;e that child blu&s;hes at your pre&s;ence, you would &s;acrifice him to coquetry!" At which he left the hou&s;e, and was ab&s;ent till late in the evening.</P>
<P>ALAS, Maria, is it not always thus where affec|tion does not controul, that caprice, petulance, and pride a&s;&s;ume command?&mdash;To you, from who&s;e pen I need not dread the &s;everity of un|ju&s;t cen&s;ure, I will candidly declare, (and tell me, wherein is the guilt?) that young Alfred in his per&s;on is not le&s;s graceful than his charming &s;i&s;|ter; to which is added an accompli&s;hment as amiable as it is extraordinary in his &s;ex; that is, a blu&s;hing mode&s;ty and politene&s;s, the general
<PB N="62" REF="032746_0060_0FF4F9276F4F3C90">
inmates of true merit. His eyes are of the black|e&s;t hue, con&s;tantly &s;parkling with feeling; and his countenance, tout en&s;emble, is the picture of &s;entiment.&mdash;Pardon me, &s;i&s;ter, if in thus breath|ing prai&s;e on the brother of my &s;econd be&s;t com|forter, I overleap in expre&s;&s;ion the re&s;traints of cu&s;tom and the world. Your own liberal mind will provide a &s;ufficient apology;&mdash;nay, does not virtue it&s;elf &s;anctify the deed? Is merit e&s;tima|ble;&mdash;and &s;hall it not be extolled? Is beauty ad|mirable;&mdash;and &s;hall it not be prai&s;ed? Is virtue amiable;&mdash;&s;hall it not be e&s;teemed? Or does a &s;tate of matrimony interdict the utterance of prai&s;e? Does it change the quality of beauty, or &s;ubtract from the excellence of merit; making a mighty hu&s;band the concentration of all e&s;ti|mable endowments?</P>
<Q><L>Can Hymen by the magic of his &s;kill,</L>
<L>The judgment alter, or pervert the will?</L></Q>
<P>You, my Maria, are not &s;o world-ridden as to affect a frown at the foregoing &s;ugge&s;tions; al|though indeed, your experience in matrimony might incline you to an&s;wer in the affirmative: Yet I am &s;ure, you think it no crime to applaud the merits of others, and even to e&s;teem, nay, love their virtues; not is there, in the eye of rea|&s;on

<P>I HAVE &s;omewhere before ob&s;erved, that fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions invariably &s;tamp the future character of a man; particularly in the e&s;timation of the ladies. A di&s;gu&s;t produced by improper conduct at a fir&s;t interview, is immutable; and the pre|&s;ence of the offender is ever after avoided: On the other hand, a certain lucky deportment, which &s;ome men inherit from nature, is &s;ure to win the partiality of the fair;&mdash;a partiality which, by &s;ub&s;equent addre&s;s, is ea&s;ily converti|ble into love. In &s;hort, I believe, the fly urchin always approaches the female heart in the &s;imili|tude of e&s;teem; and only after obtaining admi&s;|&s;ion, unma&s;ks him&s;elf.</P>
<P>So far from di&s;countenancing your pa&s;&s;ion, it is my &s;incere wi&s;h that, by a per&s;everance in the pur&s;uit, you will evince to the object the &s;incerity of your motives. Nay, my friend, it would be meritorious, to &s;oothe the aching bo&s;om of this beautiful wife, whom you mention as having been

forced into the "rude embrace" of her pre&s;on hu&s;band; and, by a conduct marked with care and affection, rob the &s;elfi&s;h wretch of that which he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>To conceive of crime, we mu&s;t previou&s;ly ad|mit an idea of guilt concealed in the heart. Mo|tives being the only true criterion by which to e&s;|timate the relative quality of action, it is not ju&s;t to cull precipitant opinions from &s;uperficial out|lines of conduct; but mu&s;t probe and anatomize the heart and its propelling principles. Hence, if you have candidly avowed the reality of your feelings on this occa&s;ion, your pa&s;&s;ion, being the &s;pontaneous effect of a conviction of extraordina|ry merit in the object, is virtuous and laudable. It is true, the world, the terrible world, will frown on your advances:&mdash;Your beloved too, will &s;tart with affrighted virtue at the dangerous propo&s;i|tion:&mdash;but it is for your love, your art, your rea|&s;on, your addre&s;s, to harmonize to her principles a conduct, viewed by mankind as the lowe&s;t ex|tremity of female deba&s;ement:&mdash;it is for your fortitude to endure the cen&s;ure of an undivided world.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>WHITEHALL FARM.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR MARIA,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT an intolerable afternoon has my la&s;t been; wa&s;ted in the company of three &s;lan|derous and antiquated women, as well as exiled from the enlivening &s;ociety of Mi&s;s Alfred!&mdash;Even this misfortune, however, has not been un|profitable: No; it has at lea&s;t taught me, that our internal faculties, di&s;united from external relations, and joined to a malignity of &s;pirit, can render us individually more mi&s;erable, than the influence of foreign objects on a mind duly tem|pered with patience and virtue. While I li&s;ten|ed to the decayed victims of envy carping at &s;uc|ce&s;sful
<PB N="67" REF="032746_0065_0FF4F9375B7EA2A0">
virtue and innocence, I was feelingly ad|moni&s;hed to dete&s;t and avoid beings, who, by a pe&s;tilential banefulne&s;s, alike de&s;troy their own and their neighbour's peace of mind! Of &s;uch a character are the ancient Mi&s;s Haywords, whom, in a former letter, I mentioned as comprizing a family in this neighbourhood. Their long-en|gaged vi&s;it at length has been performed; not, however, without &s;everal circum&s;tances which gave new occa&s;ion for a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>YESTERDAY morning, after an ab&s;ence of &s;ome hours, which is his cu&s;tom, Mr. Franks return|ing, informed me in a very courteous manner, that I might expect an early vi&s;it that afternoon from the maiden ladies, our neighbours; add|ing, in a tone and empha&s;is which betrayed a particular &s;olicitude to plea&s;e, that every readi|ne&s;s mu&s;t be made to receive &s;uch re&s;pectable and valuable vi&s;itors with marked politene&s;s and re|&s;pect. After per&s;onally arranging a variety of articles, and appointing the &s;ervants to their re|&s;pective duties; nay, even entering the kitchen to enjoin on the girls a grave and decorous de|portment, he again ha&s;tily left the hou&s;e without dining! This extraordinary conduct in a man who, believe me, never evinced a de&s;ire to plea&s;e a &s;oul but him&s;elf, gave me an uncommon a|larm;
<PB N="68" REF="032746_0066_0FF4F938E786B6A0">
and for a con&s;iderable time afterwards I was totally incapable of directing my mind to any rational object; until reverting to the friend|&s;hip of my worthy Fanny Alfred, I &s;cribbled an incoherent note, reque&s;ting her company in the afternoon: But alas, misfortune deprived me of her &s;oothing &s;ociety! An alarming accident had that morning produced an indi&s;po&s;ition, by which my lovely girl was confined to her room! Thus was I doomed to a torture, the approach of which I awaited with a trembling agitation not inferior to that of a criminal at the awful moments preceding the hour of execution.</P>
<P>AT about three o'clock, an ancient and &s;uperb' carriage drove up to the gate; where, Mr. Franks fir&s;t nimbly alighting, with indu&s;trious po|litene&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted three old ladies (more the re&s;em|blance of Macbeth's witches) to de&s;cend. A de&s;|cription of their per&s;ons, each of which differed in &s;ome particular from the other, would require the pencil of Hogarth. Suffice it, they were an humourous triumvirate of living oddities, render|ed frightful either by the ravages of time, or by the more deforming influence of their acrid tem|pers. The younge&s;t, about fifty, Mi&s;s Harriot, was fanta&s;tically dre&s;&s;ed in a crim&s;on &s;attin, an|cient as her&s;elf, with a large blue &s;loath on her
<PB N="69" REF="032746_0067_0FF4F942B5B7A5E0">
head. Mi&s;s Charlotte, &s;omewhat more advanc|ed in years, with a head bounteou&s;ly "&s;prinkled with the fro&s;t of time," was not le&s;s ridiculous in her apparel; adding to a blue &s;ilk chemi&s;e, the appendant foppery of brocade ruffles, crape, and a firmament of &s;pangles. Mi&s;s Maria, not quite &s;eventy, in her appearance, approached mo&s;t to the re&s;emblance of human nature; al|though at certain moments, the violent di&s;tor|tions of her face, occa&s;ioned by the twitch of &s;ome acute pain, rendered her a being as truly hideous as were her &s;i&s;ters ludicrous!</P>
<P>THIS groupe I u&s;hered into the hall; where, after a number of laughable perplexities, ari&s;ing from their aukward decrepitude, they &s;ucceeded in &s;eating them&s;elves. "Mercy," cried Mi&s;s Harriot, how intolerably warm this place is!"&mdash;"Heaven!" added Mi&s;s Charlotte, "warm, &s;i&s;|ter! I am &s;ure it is very plea&s;ant,"&mdash;" Plea&s;ant!; exclaimed Marian, "I fear I &s;hall imbibe my death of cold; the current of air that pa&s;&s;es this avenue is &s;o highly &s;aturate I with moi&s;ture and cold." While thus, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ional exclamations, they di&s;covered their con&s;titutional climes of temperature, their active gallant was bu&s;y in pro|viding refre&s;hments, and I &s;ilently gazing at the ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of their grimace and di&s;cour&s;e. A
<PB N="70" REF="032746_0068_0FF4F94448294B60">
de&s;ultory conver&s;ation en&s;ued; from which I learnt, that the&s;e ladies, from certain incidents in early life, had imbibed a mi&s;anthrophic prin|ciple, the venom of which they infu&s;ed to all their actions and words. They murder the &s;anc|tity of character with delightful enthu&s;ia&s;m; and exult while wallowing in the guiltle&s;s blood of injured reputation. Yes, Maria, they are the wor&s;t of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; for they murder indi&s;cri|minately the hopes of the children of virtue, and &s;trangle the ju&s;t &s;ame of &s;ucce&s;sful innocence!</P>
<P>AMONG the number of victims to their ma|lice, I was &s;entenced to hear included my dear and innocent friend, Mi&s;s Alfred. Mi&s;s Harri|ot, the apparent favorite of Mr. Franks, conclud|ed a rapid harangue with a vile and calumniat|ing in&s;inuation again&s;t the character of my ab|&s;ent Fanny. Without any knowledge of her fa|mily or connexions, &s;he maliciou&s;ly attributed her pre&s;ent retirement to &s;ome di&s;graceful amour in the city; to which her envious &s;i&s;ters, and, &s;hame on him, even Franks, tacitly acceded!&mdash;Oh, Maria, at that moment, how did my blood boil with indignation and rage! My already &s;cat|tered rea&s;on had almo&s;t for&s;ook me; and I was on the point of replying to their calumnies in a voice of reproach and contempt, when a gentler
<PB N="71" REF="032746_0069_0FF4F945D51CE458">
&s;pirit took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed its ardor by a general &s;arca&s;m at their &s;u&s;picions, and a continued har&s;hne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion for the remainder of the vi&s;it; to which they &s;eemed as indifferent, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> are their minds callous to the im|pre&s;&s;ions of benevolence. At an early hour, however, the fear of "imbibing cold" hurried the&s;e wretches from my hou&s;e, e&s;corted by their former chevalier. I in&s;tantly flew acro&s;s the woodland to enquire of the health of my angelic friend, and had the unutterable happine&s;s of find|ing her chearful and compo&s;ed. On my return home, which was not before du&s;k, my hu&s;band was &s;till ab&s;ent, and did not appear until very late in the evening.</P>
<P>IT is then in the baneful &s;ociety of the&s;e ve|nomous wa&s;ps, that Franks employs his many hours of ab&s;ence; while I, in &s;olitary rambles through the&s;e de&s;art woods, counting the mi&s;e|ries of my life, have intercour&s;e only with me|lancholy and de&s;pair!&mdash;</P>

<P>THIS ignoble treatment, Maria, you will be|lieve me, is the effect of no impropriety on my part.

Late on the &s;ame evening, during the ab&s;ence of Franks, I opened a cele|brated author on the plea&s;ures of Solitude, not doubting but that there I &s;hould meet with a temporary alleviation of mind;&mdash;but alas, a few pages delineated the following picture of a&s;&s;ociat|ed felicity:&mdash;" Does the tear of &s;orrow &s;teal down the cheek of one?

Oh, my friend, I have found that not only her per&s;on, but her intellects are the nice&s;t products of natural beauty and art!&mdash;To an hea|venly complacency of temper, derived from the favouring hand of creation, &s;he adds a brilliancy of fancy, and a grandeur of conception, &s;uperior to the generality of her &s;ex, and which &s;uffu&s;es the mildne&s;s of her countenance, with the dig|nity and intelligence of an angel. In fine, my worthy friend, &s;he is what you would call amia|ble;

what you, were you pre&s;ent, could not re|frain from loving and adoring&mdash;Yet, alas, this fair and accompli&s;hed wife, is unhappy!&mdash;An early forced marriage, (a palliating term for pro&s;|titution) has robbed her bo&s;om of its native tran|quility; and like an heroic captive, &s;he deplores in &s;miles and graces, the cur&s;ed chains that fetter her peace and beauty. Each recollective moment crowds her holy bo&s;om with a ho&s;t of &s;ighs; and the trembling tears that gli&s;ten in her eye, pa|thetically reveal the &s;ecret &s;orrows of their &s;ource!&mdash;Such is the &s;ituation of her, who&s;e angui&s;h I would alleviate by my &s;ympathetic love. Even arrayed in the maje&s;ty of her tears I will addre&s;s her in the eloquence of my pa&s;&s;ion; by ardent entreaty, &s;educe her memory from retro&s;pective glances, to the full expectation of bli&s;s and un|mingled rapture!</P>
<P>Two evenings ago, as I fondly meditated on this endearing theme, &s;itting in the alcove behind our hou&s;e, my &s;ilent reverie was interrupted by the appearance of my Charlotte, (for Charlotte I mu&s;t call her, though I &s;hould be unwilling to be thought a Werter) cro&s;&s;ing the oppo&s;ite field, in all the maje&s;ty of graceful beauty. An univer&s;al perturbation prevailed my mind. My eyes were rivetted on her until &s;he approached; when, a&s;|&s;uming

confidence, I cordially &s;aluted her, and offered my hand with a familiarity, for which I conceived my youth an apology.&mdash;Thus, my friend, I had the tran&s;port of conducting her through a long hall to the apartment of my &s;i&s;|ter, who plea&s;antly remarked on the cordiality of our appearance. Here I enjoyed a mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed and unre&s;trained intercour&s;e with the arbitre&s;s of my hopes. With an enthu&s;ia&s;m, which I feared often betrayed its de&s;ign and tendency, I &s;poke of the &s;ublime rapture of lovers; and by indirect in|&s;inuations, &s;trove to impre&s;s her tender mind with a favourable conception of my e&s;teem. I pau&s;ed and reflected;&mdash;nay, I began already to regret the impatience of my love. Methought, the dear idol of my heart, was affected, and be|came &s;erious and re&s;erved. My &s;i&s;ter too, who had often admired the uncommon fervency of my &s;tyle, appeared amazed and concerned! Un|der the&s;e apprehen&s;ions I remained tormented until the moment of her departure, when &s;he chearfully accepted my company. Again my re&s;i&s;tle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion broke the bounds of prudence, and thundered in all the fire of zeal; to which, &s;he li&s;tened with an eagerne&s;s, that &s;eemed to in|dicate a growing approbation of the warm wi&s;hes laboring at my heart; but when I di&s;clo&s;ed the circum&s;tance of the grotto, the manner of &s;tealing

She continued remark|ably pen&s;ive the remainder of the walk.&mdash;On arriving home her hu&s;band was ab&s;ent&mdash;&s;he in|vited me to walk in:&mdash;but alas, I could not! De|clining the courte&s;y, therefore, with a compli|ment, I bid her farewell, with a gentle pre&s;&s;ure of her hand. &s;he continued at the door, methought looking after me, till I entered the wood that &s;e|parate the two farms. In this &s;ilent ob&s;curity I remained, reflecting on the pa&s;t adventure, till the approach of du&s;k, and arrived home after dark.</P>
<P>SINCE then I have vi&s;ited her in company with my &s;i&s;ter, and on the &s;ame day, fortunately met her in the bottom of the wood.

She would &s;ometimes look at me, as though affected by my condition, with an eye of tenderne&s;s: at other times inverting her countenance, &s;he &s;eem|ed di&s;plea&s;ed.&mdash;But I will not credit the evidence of my &s;en&s;es, while they intercept the hopes of my &s;oul.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AGAIN rejoice with you, on the unexpected pro&s;perity of your love and &s;hall ne|ver cea&s;e from invoking its progre&s;&s;ion. Yet my dear fellow, I am convinced, that you can, with &s;ympathetic plea&s;ure, turn from the delightful theme, to hear of the mi&s;fortunes of another.</P>

The noble nobly pity and relieve.</P>
<P>I HAVE recently met with a character, who&s;e hidden hi&s;tory engages all my intere&s;t and atten|tion. Going to the coffee-hou&s;e a few days pa&s;t, I was introduced by the proprietor to a young man, who, he &s;aid, wi&s;hed for employment in a counting-hou&s;e. His appearance immediately prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my favour, and offering my bene|faction, he entered my &s;ervice with a polite and amiable mode&s;ty. He has &s;ince convinced me by his attention and talents, that he was not un|worthy this genero&s;ity.&mdash;Yet my friend, deep|rooted &s;orrow hangs heavily on his brow&mdash;op|pre&s;&s;ive &s;ighs and alternate tears, &s;well his labour|ing bo&s;om or gli&s;ten in his eyes. Perceiving the&s;e emotions, I ventured to make inquiry of his di&s;|tre&s;s, and offer the aid of my friend&s;hip to allay its pungency. "Ah, my worthy benefactor," he replied, "what would not genero&s;ity like yours do in common. It &s;oothes but cannot cure the an|gui&s;h of my &s;oul. I once was happy, but the &s;or|did world de&s;troyed my peace, and my futurity is filled only with woe and de&s;peration." With this his grief became more vehement, and my anxiety increa&s;ed; but his agony re&s;i&s;ted the ef|forts of friend&s;hip; and, as if &s;elfi&s;h of tears, he refu&s;ed to excite mine by his narrative.

"There I was born," he &s;aid, "and there enjoyed un|mingled bli&s;s. Bani&s;hed from thence I lo&s;t all peace."&mdash;He arrived here in great nece&s;&s;ity from Bermuda, where he had been carried and robbed of his little all, by the infamous violaters of our commerce and independence. His countenance is extremely intere&s;ting, and has once been hand|&s;ome; his manners are courteous and polite; his conver&s;ation intelligent, and his minute&s;t actions are evidences of a &s;uperior education.&mdash;He calls him&s;elf Tallman, and has been bred to the mer|cantile profe&s;&s;ion; but this is all of his life and family that he will di&s;clo&s;e, &s;aying, "'Tis better to live unpitied, than to die lamented,"</P>
<P>THERE is one circum&s;tance remarkable in the ca&s;e of this youth. His application to bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to intermit his grief. As, when he reflects on his misfortunes, his faculties are all ab&s;orbed in agony, &s;o when he turns his mind to other em|ployments, his mi&s;fortunes are forgotten. This fact has led me to create a variety of objects for his attention, in hopes of weening him from grief. Should I pro&s;per in the endeavour, believe me, I would not barter feelings with a monarch.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t was indeed a welcome cordial to my agitated bo&s;om. Its tender con|tents &s;u&s;pended the rigor of reflection; and for a time my mind was tranquillized in the oblivi|ous enjoyment of your love and &s;ympathy. But ah, the&s;e kind intervals of joy &s;eem re&s;erved only to embitter &s;ome &s;ucceeding di&s;a&s;ter! The&s;e tran|&s;ient fla&s;hes of delight are the unerring preludes to the thunder of di&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;I had ju&s;t di&s;patch|ed

Already had a momentary regret for this &s;tep &s;eized my mind; but your timely approbation di&s;&s;ipated its influence, and confirmed me in ap|proving the mea&s;ure as indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary, as well to avert my own mi&s;ery as the de&s;truction of the principles of this amiable youth. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Maria, it was too <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of my addre&s;s to the unde&s;igning lad. Alas, thought I, as I wrote it, I have already wounded his tranquillity! How ungenerous then, will it be,&mdash;how cruel, to add to his pre&s;ent unhappine&s;s, the poignancy of cen|&s;ure or the &s;everity of anger! My words there|fore, were of the gentle&s;t kind, &s;elected by ten|derne&s;s and re&s;pect. He an&s;wered it immedi|ately; and oh, my &s;i&s;ter, his expre&s;&s;ions, more unequivocal than ever, convinced me he had pe|netrated through the incautious veil of my words. At one moment, my wicked heart was mortified at the &s;eeming indifference he expre&s;&s;ed with re|gard to my reque&s;t; at the next, my under&s;tand|ing was a&s;toni&s;hed by the cogency of his rea&s;on; and finally, I was overwhelmed by a &s;ilent ago|ny, from the circum&s;tance of his per&s;i&s;ting in a|vowing the influence of a feeling, which, although

ab&s;tractedly harmle&s;s, in our &s;ituation, would prove imminently dangerous.</P>
<P>OH, Maria, teach me the &s;tubborn principles of matrimonial duty: Learn me the art, for it is not nature, of looking on merit and demerit, on virtue and vice, with indi&s;criminate eyes, and an unmoved heart; for, to be happy, I mu&s;t be in&s;en&s;ible to either.</P>
<P>HE has detained my billet as an ho&s;tage for another interview. Alas, dare I tempt the edge of that re&s;i&s;tle&s;s vortex who&s;e gulph is horror and remor&s;e? Yet why do I a&s;k? 'Tis vain in my heart to attempt to allay its angui&s;h by avoid|ing the &s;ociety of him who&s;e pre&s;ence is rapture, and who&s;e ab&s;ence already &s;addens my joy!&mdash;I overhear &s;omebody entering below! It is my Fanny no doubt. Farewell, for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>&mdash;OH hide me, hide me, from the cen&s;ur|ing world! Hide me, if po&s;&s;ible, from my&s;elf! Maria, even deny me your pity; nor &s;uffer thy hallowed tears to flow in &s;ympathy for a wretch who&s;e misfortunes are the effects of her crimes!&mdash;Crimes! did I &s;ay?&mdash;Oh heavens! Gracious God, wherein am I guilty? Is the purity of my

&s;oul contaminated by the exerci&s;e of principles which thou ha&s;t planted in my nature? Can na|ture's milk-white innocence become demoniac, by indulging her greate&s;t, fir&s;t prerogative? Is virtue a certain divine attribute of the mind, in|fu&s;ed at creation, or is it but a vi&s;ionary creature of the world's invention? I feel it to be a princi|ple immutable and eternal. The proud efforts of men to modify or counterfeit its characters, are the &s;chemes of impiety, or the machinations of fiends.</P>
<P>ADIEU, until I compo&s;e my mind.</P>
<P>THE foregoing reflections have tended gra|dually to &s;ub&s;ide my de&s;pair, and my rea&s;on af|ter a tempe&s;tuous tumult, is calm enough to re|late the circum&s;tance which took place on fir&s;t leaving my pen. Alas, in&s;tead of meeting my endeared Fanny, I ru&s;hed into the parlour, and there was a&s;toni&s;hed with the per&s;on of her bro|ther! He was &s;tanding in the middle of the room, his hat in his hand, and dre&s;&s;ed in a riding-&s;uit. My emotion was obvious:&mdash;He blu&s;hed; and after an expre&s;&s;ive bow, begged me to forgive the freedom he a&s;&s;umed:&mdash;"If, madam," &s;aid

he, "I encroach on the decorum of the world by this unlooked-for vi&s;it, impute it not to de|&s;ign; but to the innocence of my years and the fervency of my e&s;teem." Oh, Maria, I looked forgivene&s;s! For the impatient youth, darting his love-fraught eyes upon my countenance, with|out my being able to reply, &s;o dumb was my confu&s;ion, added:&mdash;"Alas, madam, I am &s;oon to be torn from your dear &s;ociety, by the urgen|cy of my father's affairs in the city! Oh, at a juncture, which, of all my life, I &s;hould prefer to devote to retirement and friend&s;hip, I am dragged to the labor of a counting-hou&s;e and the more loath&s;ome noi&s;e of the city! But e&s;|teemed madam, no motives could induce me to depart without performing my obligation to re|turn this di&s;tre&s;sful paper, and with it thus hum|bly implore from your lips a pardon for my re|cent temerity." Oh, &s;i&s;ter, can you po&s;&s;ibly con|ceive of the agitated tumult of my mind, on hearing this tender addre&s;s, proceeding from one I &s;o highly e&s;teemed, and kneeling at my feet, with tears gli&s;tening through the fire of his eyes, and per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence glowing on his lips! I continued in&s;en&s;ibly &s;ilent, until the load at my heart bur&s;ting from my eyes, afforded an alleviation by a torrent of tears; after which I &s;ucceeded in making a fau'tering and, I fear, un|intelligible

reply.&mdash;Oh, Maria, yet do I fear, that in the frenzy of my &s;oftened &s;oul, my unguided tongue betrayed tho&s;e unholy feelings at my heart, to conceal which I had inwardly &s;worn! He left me, &s;i&s;ter, with joy dancing in his face: His eyes, brim-full of &s;entiment, fixed upon me; one hand on his brea&s;t, the other rai&s;ed in ex|clamation, as he retired &s;aying: "Adieu, dear|e&s;t madam: Your heavenly tears interpret my happine&s;s:&mdash;I will be obedient:&mdash;Farewell!"&mdash;Oh, my angel of peace, to your friend&s;hip I fly for pity and forgivene&s;s! Can I de&s;erve pity, and not hope forgivene&s;s? Is my &s;oul vitally tainted by a vicious attachment; or are my pre|&s;ent feelings only the temporary effects of an impre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility?

<P>YOUR ab&s;ence from the country has di&s;pen&s;ed a gloomine&s;s over all our features. Even my amiable friend, Mrs. Franks, langui&s;hes for the period of your return.

<SALUTE>DEAREST SISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR la&s;t, &s;o fraught with genuine di&s;tre&s;s, arrived at a moment when my whole &s;oul was agitated by a pathetic fact, which has recently occurred in this city.&mdash;Alas, my dear girl, it is not you alone whom calamity vi&s;its:&mdash;the &s;ons and daughters of affliction are as nume|rous
<PB N="102" REF="032746_0100_0FF4F9C6B24C53D8">
as the votaries of humanity:&mdash;Sympathy need never be idle; and the tear of pity may un|cea&s;ingly trickle from the eye of tenderne&s;s, while bigotry, avarice, and vanity violate the &s;u&s;|ceptive bo&s;om of innocence and love.</P>
<P>SINCE our e&s;tabli&s;hment in this city, among the acquaintances we have formed, a family of the name of Williams, con&s;i&s;ting of a re&s;pecta|ble father and mother, and three dutiful &s;ons, has not been the lea&s;t flattering and agreeable. My earlie&s;t ob&s;ervation in it, was the &s;incere pa&s;|&s;ion which the elde&s;t &s;on con&s;tantly avowed for a neighboring female, who&s;e parents, though not in the habit of intimacy with his, were ever cor|dial and polite to his addre&s;&s;es. A mutual and and unvaried affection had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them from their infancy, and, "growing with their growth," the time had now arrived in which they anticipated the unbounded fruition of their juvenile hopes. Their parents, having hereto|fore tacitly acquie&s;ced in their union, beheld with unutterable plea&s;ure the cea&s;ele&s;s con&s;tancy of their children, which could be productive of no|thing but the mo&s;t unmingled happine&s;s to all. The day of fe&s;tive gladne&s;s was appointed, and Mr. Williams, in order to equalize his &s;on's e&s;tate with the expected affluence of his daughter-in-law,
<PB N="103" REF="032746_0101_0FF4F9C843AA9558">
purcha&s;ed an elegant hou&s;e, and furni&s;hed it with every article of grandeur and convenience; be&s;ides a hand&s;ome donation in ca&s;h, which he re&s;erved for the day of celebration. The bli&s;s|ful and expectant hour opened to the warm feel|ings of the young lovers a thou&s;and &s;cenes of un|ta&s;ted joy&mdash;a thou&s;and &s;ources of ineffable de|light. Loui&s;a already looked upon Henry as the plighted hu&s;band of her &s;oul, and poured into his bo&s;om her unre&s;trained confidence; while he, with feelings equally elated, made her the &s;upreme mi&s;tre&s;s of his thoughts!&mdash;Thus did the rapturous &s;cene glow in their vivid imaginations, and tantalize expectation, when the &s;ordid pa|rents of Loui&s;a, taking her to their clo&s;et, thus addre&s;&s;ed her:&mdash;"Dear Loui&s;a, your happine&s;s and future comfort being the only hope and ob|ject of our lives, we have with plea&s;ure beheld, and cheri&s;hed with parental indulgence, the vir|tuous pa&s;&s;ion you have long felt for Henry Wil|liams. In three days more our period of duty and authority will expire; and before this we earne&s;tly wi&s;h by one dictate of prudence, well to conclude the work ever nighe&s;t our hearts."&mdash;The a&s;toni&s;hed Loui&s;a, unable to di&s;cern the ten|dency of this ambiguous exordium, remained pen&s;ively &s;ilent; and her father continued;&mdash;"You know the di&s;parity of young Williams'
<PB N="104" REF="032746_0102_0FF4F9D1ADCF1CA0">
fortune, and the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of men of his profe&s;&s;ion and years&mdash;Let us then be&s;eech you, as you regard your future welfare and our &s;o|lemn reque&s;t, the la&s;t perhaps, we &s;hall ever end join, previous to your marriage, to call for an at|torney and confirm on your children, the fortune left you by your uncle: what we are able to be|&s;tow will equal, if not exceed the fortune of your hu&s;band."&mdash;Loui&s;a was all comprehen&s;ion, and looking with an eye of affection fir&s;t at her atten|tive mother, and then her father, &s;he exclaimed, "Is it po&s;&s;ible, father, that he, to who&s;e honour and fidelity I am to commit my per&s;on and pre|cious happine&s;s, is deemed unworthy to be tru&s;t|ed with a trifling &s;um of paltry gold!"&mdash;and turning, with a &s;igh acceded to the propo&s;ition of her parents, as the only means of reconciling them to participate in their approaching bli&s;s. An attorney was obtained, and her fortune of five thou&s;and pounds &s;ecured to the offspring of her legal marriage, and forever wre&s;ted from the touch of her hu&s;band. Their exulting parents beheld the nigh approach of their children's happine&s;s, with accumulated tran&s;port! The en|raptured Henry for&s;ook the world; and devoted his time to the retired &s;ociety of his amiable Loui&s;a:&mdash;Loui&s;a di&s;clo&s;ed the ungenerous deed &s;he had been obliged to perform.&mdash;Its &s;u&s;picious

a&s;pect, and concealed proce&s;s, enraged the pride of his &s;oul!&mdash;He flew to his father, related the in&s;iduous act, and with aggravated frenzy cur&s;ed the foul and penurious machination!&mdash;His fa|ther, naturally of a high and independent &s;pirit, heard his &s;on with mortified ambition, and in flames of vindictive manline&s;s ha&s;tened to the pre&s;ence of the parents of Loui&s;a&mdash;They receiv|ed him with cordiality; but their demeanour was &s;oon changed into coldne&s;s and reproach, by his unbridled vehemence; and after a clamorous al|tercation, in which the agonized Loui&s;a mingled her tears, he left them with a &s;olemn denuncia|tion of the match, and an imprecation on their iniquitous penury. All intercour&s;e between the parties was interdicted; the hou&s;e, furniture, &amp;c. purcha&s;ed by Mr. Williams, re-&s;old, and the in|tended &s;olemnization annihilated.</P>
<P>&mdash;Here, Caroline, pau&s;e, and enquire of your &s;oul, if this horrid tale could thus conclude? Say, my &s;i&s;ter, is it po&s;&s;ible to your conception, that the divine and unadulterated fervor of this young pair, could, by this interpo&s;ition of avarice, be re&s;olved into apathy and indifference?&mdash;Could that cele&s;tial pa&s;&s;ion, who&s;e weake&s;t votary has &s;urvived the &s;hocks of fate, become extinct by a

mere artifice of parental covetousne&s;s?&mdash;No, Ca|roline, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with nature and nature's God.</P>
<P>LOUISA'S angui&s;h at this di&s;a&s;trous event is not to be de&s;cribed!&mdash;After uttering her grief in the agony of tears and lamentation, &s;he droop|ed into a &s;ettled melancholy. Immured in her chamber, and refu&s;ing the comfort of the world, her lonely reflections aggravated the deletery in|fluence of her mi&s;fortune: She gradually de|clined; and in a few months, her relentle&s;s pa|rents beheld the awful advances of their child's di&s;&s;olution; which &s;he viewed with a placid be|nignity of &s;oul. "Death, like a friend" indeed, &s;eemed to &s;uccour her affliction: and by a gradu|al and mild operation, terminated the bitter pangs of her heart. Yet even at the &s;olemn pe|riod of her decline, her mind dwelt on the con|&s;tancy and love of Henry with delightful exta|cy; and in departing from her &s;orrowing friends, forever clo&s;ed her quivering lips in pronouncing his beloved name! Her fate reached the ears of the frantic Henry, who, until this time, had been kept ignorant even of her indi&s;po&s;ition! He flew to the hou&s;e,&mdash;but at fir&s;t was denied this la&s;t &s;ad plea&s;ure of beholding his lifele&s;s Loui&s;a!&mdash;He was, however, admitted for a few minutes,

on cruel conditions. Leaning on the arm of his younger brother as he cro&s;&s;ed the ai&s;le which con|ducted to the &s;olemn apartment, his weakened &s;en&s;es &s;tarted at the melancholy idea, and for a time an univer&s;al agony rendered him uncon&s;ci|ous of his real &s;ituation.&mdash;He entered the dar|kened room, and approaching the coffin, beheld his lately blooming love beautiful even in the frozen arms of death!&mdash;"Oh!" he exclaimed; but his &s;urcharged heart gu&s;hing from his eyes, ob&s;tructed the farther utterance of his grief. He gazed on the cold eloquence of her face; touch|ed with his hand her pal&s;ied cheek; and with a ki&s;s who&s;e ardor &s;eemed to breathe his &s;oul to the object, was dragged from the tragic &s;pec|tacle!</P>
<P>HE attended the funeral rites; and &s;ince has been continually ab&s;orbed in &s;ilent &s;orrow! His &s;oul, at times, &s;eems ab&s;tracted from his body, and in relap&s;ing from his reveries, he often fer|vently exclaims, "I have &s;een my Loui&s;a! She is with her kindred &s;pirits in bli&s;s; and I &s;hall &s;oon be happy!"&mdash;While he thus paces in pur|&s;uit of the &s;ame grave which enclo&s;es his hopes of life and felicity, his loving parents, oppre&s;&s;ed with age and affliction, are hourly progre&s;&s;ing to|wards their end. Sorrow has rai&s;ed her banner

<P>FROM this intere&s;ting narrative, my love, you will perceive, that, although others of your &s;ex endure not the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which you are de&s;tined, they are not wholly exempt from the a&s;perities of fate.

<SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the date of this you will ob|&s;erve I have &s;uddenly removed from the mild &s;cenes of love and innocence to the bu&s;y metro|polis of the American world.&mdash;Yes, friend, at a moment when the cri&s;is of my love was tottering on the balance of thought; while I was torment|ed with the heavy cen&s;ure of my Charlotte, a di&s;patch from my father demanded my immedi|ate pre&s;ence in this city!&mdash;My relunctant &s;oul fluttered between duty and love; until at length, the former prevailing, I hurried to the city, af|ter a pathetic farewell; abandoning the joys of love and retirement, for the pur&s;uits and labor of a counting-hou&s;e! But even in the mid&s;t of this perplexity, my a&s;tounded hopes were revived by the flattering emotions of her I love, on the vi&s;it I made to bid her adieu!</P>

KNOW fir&s;t, my friend, that the rapturous in|terview of the grove, which I mentioned in my la&s;t, and in which I partly gave vent to the fer|vor of my &s;oul, had nigh been the finalle of our intercour&s;e! The watchful prudence of my love|ly friend, though apparently plea&s;ed with the language of my pa&s;&s;ion while I expre&s;&s;ed it, on returning home became highly incen&s;ed, and the day following honored me with a &s;hort epi&s;tle, written with the ea&s;e and elegance of Rowe, in which the idea of my love was reprobated as in|compatible with her duty and my own honor; adding a &s;olemn injunction in perpetual &s;ilence on my lips.&mdash;Think, my friend, with what a trembling anxiety I received the important let|ter!&mdash;My eager eyes flew quickly over her ten|der admonition: while my heart leaped with alternate hopes and fears!&mdash;The female &s;ervant who delivered the note, returning without an an|&s;wer of any kind, I was left to indulge in the ad|miration of her, who even in a&s;&s;umed har&s;hne&s;s, proved her heart &s;oft and compa&s;&s;ionate! Yes, Bill, it was plain, that while her pen obeyed the impul&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, in cen&s;uring my love, the wound intended for me was felt more &s;everely by her&s;elf! She relied tenderly on my friend&s;hip; and hoped, (oh, think of my tran&s;port at the&s;e

words!) that her denial of love would not al&s;o exclude the calmer plea&s;ures of e&s;teem.</P>
<P>I AFTERWARDS returned a &s;tudied an&s;wer to her communication; in which I endeavoured, by a complication of feelings, at lea&s;t to convince her of the purity of my attachment, and the fidelity of my heart, if not to produce in her mind a &s;en|timent congenial with my own.

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. TO CHARLES ALFRED.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;YOUR pa&s;&s;ion, it is evident, has pa&s;&s;ed the rubicon! The die is ca&s;t! Charlotte's wounded heart throbs only as your influence di|rects; and by a judicious artfulne&s;s, you may &s;oon a&s;cend to voluptuous bli&s;s, and be the ac|knowledged Nabob of her charms!</P>
<P>I AM aware, this &s;alutation will almo&s;t di&s;gu&s;t the tenacious cha&s;tity of your love; becau&s;e, e|ven

enamoured as you are with your mi&s;tre&s;s, your innocent, boyi&s;h heart conceives of no rap|ture but that which flows from virtuous love!&mdash;Yet, believe me, what I have heretofore ob&s;erv|ed in extenuation of the principles of your amour, is emphatically applicable to the full con&s;umma|tion of it. The &s;ame pure and guiltle&s;s &s;enti|ments which at fir&s;t glow in the brea&s;ts of a lov|ing pair, are &s;trengthened and diffu&s;ed by this confirming te&s;timonial of mutual confidence:&mdash;Nay, the trembling flame, which before was lia|ble to expire at the fir&s;t bla&s;t of coolne&s;s or in|difference, by this undying touch of extacy, is converted into an everla&s;ting blaze in each, which reciprocally warms, vivifies, and enligh|tens both. The joy of &s;ouls thus reciprocally exchanged is &s;ublimely ineffable.</P>
<P>BUT in thus rea&s;oning in your behalf, I wi&s;h not to implicate a defence of tho&s;e females, who, not from a de&s;ire to evince the &s;incere ardency of their love, but from wild infatuation, pro&s;titute their virtue and charms, by falling into the di&s;|graceful embraces of a treacherous &s;educer. A young female, who, in all her affections, &s;hould ever have a fixed eye on matrimony, in &s;o yield|ing to the per&s;ua&s;ions of a villainous lover, ex|hibits a weakne&s;s of virtue equal to her &s;hallow|ne&s;s

of mind; whereas, a forced wife, circum|&s;tanced as is your heroine, and feeling for ano|ther that cele&s;tial glow which &s;he never felt for her hu&s;band, affords a doubtle&s;s proof of the ear|ne&s;tne&s;s of her attachment, by a &s;urrender of her per&s;on; and in that act &s;he is le&s;s guilty than tho&s;e who before dragged her to the bed of one, the embraces of whom, though &s;anctioned by human laws, were a violation of natural virtue and of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE intere&s;ting melancholy of my young ac|quaintance re&s;i&s;ts all the con&s;olatory efforts of friend&s;hip.&mdash;I prevailed on him la&s;t evening to accompany me to the theatre, at the performance of Shake&s;pear's Hamlet. For a time, the bril|liancy of the hou&s;e, the "ornaments of the box|es," and the &s;pirit of the oche&s;tra, &s;o far engaged his admiration, as to &s;hoot tran&s;ient &s;parkles of joy in his face, the fir&s;t I have ever ob&s;erved:&mdash;But the progre&s;s of the tragedy re&s;tored his u&s;u|al look of melancholy. At times, he would eye the charming Mrs. Mar&s;hall, in Ophelia, with e|motions of amazement, and inquire, "Who is &s;he? What's her name?" Being an&s;wered, he exclaimed with a &s;igh, "Heavens, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> frantic am I!"</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="032746_0113_0FF4F9F3209BBB88">
NEXT I ob&s;erved his emotions increa&s;ing, by the character of the hero; who&s;e peculiar inter|e&s;t and &s;entiment was admirably expre&s;&s;ed in the appearance and action of my theatrical friend, young Moreton. When he pronounced the &s;o|liloquy in Act III. Scene Fir&s;t, Tallman be|came &s;o violently indi&s;po&s;ed as to be obliged to be conducted home; where he has been &s;ince con|fined to his bed by a violent fever, with intervals of delirium! To-day, however, I am happy to find his illne&s;s has con&s;iderably abated. He is ince&s;&s;antly begging me to pardon, what he calls, his unthankful inconvenience, &s;aying, "It will not be long thus! By your leave, my friend, as &s;oon as my health may permit, I will repair to Philadelphia, where I have friends; and oh, where even friendle&s;s, I may die with joy!" Do, Charles, for virtue's &s;ake, make &s;ome inquiries of your friends in the city, concerning the family and connexions of one Henry Tallman, a youth about twenty years of age, or upwards. He is a victim of that tyrant who at pre&s;ent controuls your varying hopes!</P>

<P>THINK not, e&s;teemed Harriot, that the friendly hint &s;ugge&s;ted in our la&s;t conver&s;a|tion, has depreciated your amiable qualities in my e&s;timation. My recent ab&s;ence from your de|lightful &s;ociety, is indeed, the con&s;equence of your benevolent in&s;inuations; yet by no means produced by a di&s;gu&s;t for the motive, but a &s;in|cere reverence of the generous principles of your heart, the innocence of your mind, and the la|mentable &s;anctity of your di&s;clo&s;ure.</P>
<P>YES, my worthy friend, the faithle&s;s partner of my bed, is, if not criminally attached to, irre|vocably concentred in the affections of, young Alfred!&mdash;She forgets or neglects the avocations of dome&s;tic life, and even avoids him to whom &s;he is &s;olemnly allianced by both religion and law!&mdash;Oh could I de&s;cribe the mixed and ago|nized reflections of my mind on this cur&s;ed di&s;|covery!&mdash;But it is impo&s;&s;ible for human lan|guage competently to expre&s;s the complicat|ed feelings of a hu&s;band, who, after a di&s;|gu&s;ting &s;eries of indifference to his wife&mdash;af|ter looking on her, and treating her, only as a nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;il&mdash;beholds the &s;ame &s;entiments

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>RETURNING to this theatre of bli&s;s, my heart prancing more nimbly than the hor&s;e, I met with an incident which not only detained me &s;everal hours from the object of my love, but al&s;o excited much &s;ympathetic &s;orrow!</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="032746_0119_0FF4FA0C15234910">
I LEFT the city about three o'clock in the af|ternoon, and having &s;lowly rode a few miles, halt|ed at a &s;mall hut, &s;ituated at the foot of a hill, covered with lofty oaks, to repay an obligation formerly conferred on me by the ru&s;tic inhabi|tants. Abruptly entering the humble roof, I was &s;tartled at the appearance of di&s;tre&s;s evident in the melancholy countenances of the mother and her three &s;obbing children! She &s;itting on a ru&s;h chair, pre&s;&s;ing a &s;creaming infant to her brea&s;t, mingling with its milk the tears of her affliction; while the two eider children, leaning on each &s;ide, catched the bitter &s;ighs of their mother with tender hearts which &s;eemed to float in the water of their eyes!&mdash;I impatiently in|quired for the father of the family, and the oc|ca&s;ion of their di&s;tre&s;sful condition; to which the di&s;tracted wife replied by exclaiming, "Oh, heaven only knows where or how Philip is!"&mdash;This heightened the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of wonder. The wretched woman being unable, from the ve|hemence of her tears, to afford the nece&s;&s;ary &s;a|tisfaction, I had recour&s;e to the elde&s;t daughter, though a child, who was equally affected with the family di&s;tre&s;s, yet le&s;s violent than her fran|tic mother.&mdash;"Oh, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, wiping with a home&s;pun apron the big tears which "rolled her blooming cheeks adown," "my dear, poor fa|ther

I comforted the chil|dren with &s;mall pre&s;ents; and delivering to their mother the amount of the rent due, left them in a &s;tate more tranquil than that in which I had found them.</P>
<P>ON returning to the door, my hor&s;e, whom I had left hitched to a &s;ence, becoming impatient of my &s;tay, had &s;lipped his bridle and ab&s;cond|ed, leaving me to follow on foot.

<OPENER><SALUTE>ESTEEMED SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO refined minds the plea&s;ures of &s;ympathy afford an exhau&s;tle&s;s fruition; but to tho&s;e who&s;e repelling bo&s;oms are alike callous to the impre&s;&s;ions of benevolence, and deaf to the feeble voice of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed virtue, the inlets of this &s;ublime intellectual enjoyment are effectually choaked by unnatural principles of &s;en&s;uality. The former are made happy, in a manner, by the calamities of their fellow-creatures; becau&s;e, their di&s;tre&s;&s;es produce an opportunity for the in|dulgence of every god-like prerogative. The latter, radically dead to &s;en&s;ibility, can partake neither of their pro&s;perity nor of their adver&s;ity; but contract within the narrow and wretched li|mits of &s;elf, every human power of intellectual enjoyment. So forcibly have the&s;e ideas been confirmed on my mind, by ob&s;ervation and the increa&s;e of experience, I am often prompted to believe, that on this univer&s;ality of feeling, which as it increa&s;es its objects, a&s;&s;imulates to the be|nign &s;pirit of philanthrophy, hang all the &s;ocial comforts of life; and that without a fellow-feel|ing

for another's woe, we would be compara|tively in&s;en&s;ible to the rigour of our own.&mdash;It is but a melancholy plea&s;ure, however, to know and commi&s;erate another's &s;ufferings, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the power to remove or alleviate the occa&s;ion. Our really <HI>feeling,</HI> does not actually <HI>lighten</HI> his grievances; but the idea of &s;ocial di&s;|tre&s;s, or a partner&s;hip in mi&s;ery, renders its en|durance more tolerable, than when we find our|&s;elves unfortunate, unfriended, and abandoned.</P>
<P>To your mind, my worthy friend, now con|vul&s;ed with the agony of injured honour, min|gled with a portion of &s;elf-condemnation, this &s;pecies of alleviation will afford but little comfort; unle&s;s indeed you can balance again&s;t the aliena|tion of one woman's affections, the acqui&s;ition of the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of another.&mdash;But this circum&s;tance, even were it po&s;&s;ible, would not ef|fectuate the re&s;toration of your wonted tran|quility. Could you, by a wonderful &s;tretch of philo&s;ophy, once conceive that a kind of repri&s;al on your wife's unfaithfulne&s;s, would equalize the irritation of both; could you even be per&s;uaded to retaliate on her perfidy by equal perfidy, I doubt not, but that intervals of unea&s;ine&s;s and re|mor&s;e would occur, to fal&s;ify your experiment.

<P>BELIEVE me, Caroline, my affection is not merely the warmth and partiality of a &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;No; the &s;olicitude of a fond mother, the abate le&s;s ardour of a friend, added to our natural al|liance, render my attachment &s;uperlatively genu|ine.

<P>THE receipt of your la&s;t, as is u&s;ual, was &s;ucceeded by a variety of entertaining re|flections.

<P>I AM not a little anxious to receive the conclu|&s;ion of that pathetic tale which your feelings &s;o

I have no doubt that the hone&s;t family will fully repay, in gra|titude the munificence of their youthful bene|factor.&mdash;What a glorious &s;ubject would it be for an humane painter, to di&s;play the mode&s;t figure of Youth, in the humble cottage of per&s;ecuted Indigence, di&s;pen&s;ing gratuitous ble&s;&s;ings &s;ooth|ing the angui&s;h of a bereaved wife, and comfort|ing the noi&s;y &s;orrows of unfriended little ones!

<P>MY young acquaintance, the unknown Tall|man, left me la&s;t week to proceed for Philadel|phia; where, as he exclaimed, his only hopes of happine&s;s were concentred.

<P>&mdash;PLAGUE on your flattery, Bill! The lucid prai&s;e you have &s;o &s;howered on the vain Alfred, has indeed made him a huge hill of vanity? I will, however, endeavour, by always emulating your commendation, to derive benefit
<PB N="138" REF="032746_0136_0FF4FA4799462760">
from the very &s;ource which inundates others with ridicule and contempt.</P>
<P>BUT, my friend, I have a &s;tronger, dearer mo|tive added to your encomium, to urge me to the practice of benevolence:&mdash;My Charlotte, the hal|lowed depo&s;it of every virtue, rewarded my be|ne&s;icence with a torrent of ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;with a full hour of endearing care&s;&s;es! I was with her &s;eat|ed on the balcony which fronts her man&s;ion, di|lating on &s;entiments of love and friend&s;hip, when we perceived coming from my father's plantation, an homely countryman, whom afterwards I found to be the father of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family to who&s;e relief my timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance had been afforded. As he advanced with his hat in his hand, his eyes &s;parkling with an hone&s;t joy, and his tongue loaded with the whole weight of his gratitude, he could but &s;carcely articulate, "Heaven ble&s;s you for pre&s;erving my dear wife and children!" After confu&s;ing me with the lavi&s;h expre&s;&s;ion of his gratitude, he proceeded, at the reque&s;t of my &s;ympathetic Charlotte, to relate the occa&s;ion of his unhappy ab&s;ence; which he did in nearly the following terms:</P>
<P>"SWEET madam, (even his vulgar eyes, &s;aw &s;omething <HI>&s;weet</HI> in the per&s;on of my fair compa|nion)
<PB N="139" REF="032746_0137_0FF4FA492521DC00">
"and you, good &s;ir, when I arrived in the city and had di&s;po&s;ed of my little all, returning to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my hor&s;e and cart, I could find neither it nor the man with whom I had left it. Zoons! &s;ays I, this will never do! So at length I traced the fellow&mdash;"Where's my cart?" &s;ays I;&mdash;" Your cart!" &s;ays he, "at the d&mdash;l; get your hor&s;e, and look for it."&mdash;Oh ho, is that the tune! So making no more ado about it, I yokes the &s;coundrel by the gills, and toated him into a &s;hop where they told me ju&s;tice might be bought; but the magi&s;trate being out, my bu&s;ine&s;s could not be done. There I waited till near night, hearing the thief cur&s;e me like Sa|tan, before the appearance of the judge, who, it &s;eemed, had a better job in hand; and, giving the villain into the care of one of his journeymen, or|dered me to appear the next morning. Ah, &s;ir, you may gue&s;s how I &s;pent the night, in grieving for the certain di&s;tre&s;s of my poor family!&mdash;Ear|ly in the morning I attended at the office, when after an&s;wering &s;ome que&s;tions and &s;wearing an oath, was told nothing could be done for me un|til Mayor's court! Oh, zookers, how my heart was then gauled! I &s;hould &s;urely have done &s;omething wicked, had not neighbour Jones met me, and told where I could find my property. It was in a dirty alley I found my poor half-&s;tarv|ed

creature, hitched to a &s;tump. She, poor &s;oul, was as rejoiced as my&s;elf; and home we trudg|ed, leaving the ju&s;tice and his man to handle the rogue who had tried to defraud me.&mdash;After cro&s;&s;ing the ferry I found your hor&s;e, which I in&s;tantly knew, grazing on the &s;ide of the road. Hitching him to my cart, I have brought him home, and left him in your &s;table."</P>
<P>HERE he pau&s;ed, as if to recover breath, of which his fervent narrative had nearly deprived him.&mdash;" Ah, dear &s;ir," continued he, "think of my a&s;toni&s;hment on coming to my dear home, to find neither wife nor children to welcome me! I was half di&s;tracted! Gue&s;&s;ing the occa&s;ion, I &s;lew to my landlord, and was there told, that my innocent family were in cu&s;tody on the &s;u&s;|&s;picion of their having di&s;hone&s;tly got the very money which your charity be&s;towed, and with which they had offered to pay the rent! Croo|kers! but for his wealth, I would have hided the &s;coundrel! When I mentioned your name and goodne&s;s, he re&s;tored us to our homely hut; where, if it will be any joy to you, heaven &s;hall hear the prayers of a whole family for your pro&s;|perity!"&mdash;Concluding thus, the aged clown, with a coar&s;e bow, left us to re&s;ume the pure plea|&s;ures of love. Oh, with what unbounded confi|dence

ever &s;ince &s;ilently pondered in &s;ad and my&s;teri|ous wonder.</P>
<P>AN in&s;tinctive &s;adne&s;s gradually &s;tole on my mind. The acutene&s;s of reflection often pro|duced tears on my cheek, without the lea&s;t con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their origin. In vain I u&s;ed every effort to remove its influence:&mdash;Read, &s;ung, danced, and played, but each contrivance was alike ineffectual, and my di&s;tended heart invo|luntarily heaved &s;ighs of predictive di&s;tre&s;s. At length, finding every other means unavailing, I re&s;olved to &s;horten its duration, by withholding my weak re&s;traint; that is, by giving it a gene|ral and unre&s;i&s;ted controul, let its violence be its own de&s;truction. For this purpo&s;e, I repaired to my &s;ympathizing grotto. Here indeed, allevia|tion &s;eemed to be produced, by the increa&s;e of lamentation.&mdash;Here, as I had before often done, I emptied my &s;urcharged heart of its latent &s;or|rows, by complaining to the rocks, and fancying' that in their &s;onorous re&s;pon&s;es, I heard the re|plication of another's angui&s;h.&mdash;Indeed, my friend, there is a &s;pecific in the &s;ociety of the&s;e aged rocks, which &s;eldom fails of relieving the poignancy of my retro&s;pective reflection. I left them wonderfully revived. A placid &s;erenity, congenial with the &s;oftne&s;s which hung on the

I had ju&s;t &s;eated my&s;elf in the li|brary, and was beginning to peru&s;e the delight|ful leaves of &s;cientific poetry by Thomp&s;on, when the enclo&s;ed letter was delivered to me, by a &s;trange and very polite &s;ervant. His introduc|tion, which was formal and &s;olemn, and his er|rand,(which was, to deliver a confidential letter) were both calculated to &s;well the fir&s;t emotions of amazement!&mdash;They did&mdash;I received the me&s;|&s;enger and his letter with trembling &s;urpri&s;e, which was increa&s;ed to horrid wonder, on read|ing the enclo&s;ed addre&s;s to me, without a genuine &s;ignature!

<P>BELIEVE me then, my friend, I think there is ob&s;ervable in the hurried diction, and apparently re&s;trained affection of the epi&s;tle, a &s;incere de|&s;ign to be of &s;ervice to you. The features of ho|ne&s;ty are perceptible through every a&s;&s;umed garb; and as villainy is infallibly detected by the con|viction of its own countenance, &s;o it may al&s;o be &s;aid, the &s;imple phy&s;iognomy of hone&s;ty invaria|bly recommends it&s;elf to confidence. The for|mer cannot counterfeit even the language or ex|terior of the latter:&mdash;in its mo&s;t artful attempts, it always retains its native brogue of criminality.&mdash;This being the ca&s;e, and we are to judge of the integrity of the de&s;ign, by the complexion of the letter, and other collateral circum&s;tances, I am convinced, if you will re-peru&s;e it with attenti|on, you will join with me in believing, that an acquie&s;cence in the required interview, will by no means endanger your &s;afety; but probably accelerate the progre&s;s of that happine&s;s, which is re&s;erved for you in the &s;kies.</P>

No, Fanny, though po&s;&s;ibly it may relate to the amiable Wellsford, be a&s;&s;ured, that the language of his love, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, would not for a moment be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, for the perpetration of a &s;cheme of ridicu|lous chivalry.

<SALUTE>DEAR FRIEND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE fir&s;t moments of retirement after arriving in this city, I thus thankfully dedi|cate to your di&s;intere&s;ted &s;ympathy. Alas, &s;ir, my feelings re&s;emble tho&s;e of a wretch, who, when on the edge of immediate ruin, has been re&s;cued, and then devoted to a more &s;low and af|flicting de&s;truction! Oh, when will misfortune have exhau&s;ted her mi&s;eries on my devoted head! In every vici&s;&s;itude of life, every change of cir|cum&s;tance, her vengeance pur&s;ues me, inflicting on my guiltle&s;s &s;oul, the conden&s;ed angui&s;h of her power! A &s;ucce&s;&s;ive climax of woes has marked my infant career in life; while benevo|lence like yours has been interpo&s;ed merely to variegate its appearance, or to &s;harpen the pangs that were to &s;ucceed! While I was enjoying the &s;weet repa&s;t of charity at your hands, de&s;tiny was recruiting her wa&s;ted &s;trength and forging new and peculiar calamities!</P>
<P>My mind being wholly engaged in the antici|pation of love and con&s;tancy, it was not until

the familiar &s;cenes of nativity and infancy ap|peared, that I reverted to the connexions of my blood. Alas, five years ab&s;ence and fifty of mi&s;|fortune, had partly era&s;ed from my memory the fond idea of father, mother, and my other kin|dred! Heavens! tho&s;e reverend titles exi&s;t no more, but in the faint annals of my recollection! The dreadful fever of 1793, &s;wept into eternity a father, mother, &s;i&s;ter, and two brothers!&mdash;Oh, my worthy friend, can your humanity con|ceive of the effects of this horrid intelligence; which was the fir&s;t &s;alute I received in this city? It for a while prevented me from an enquiry which &s;eemed paramount even to this melancho|ly circum&s;tance. I had left in this city, arrayed in tears of &s;orrow at my departure, the cele&s;tial object who had received and an&s;wered with equal ardor, the fir&s;t affections of my heart; and from the hopes of who&s;e con&s;tancy, even in the bitter|ne&s;s of my woe, I derived a cheering emotion of joy. Fear and hope ru&s;hed into my trembling bo&s;om; and under the influence of both, I have &s;o far explored the region of bli&s;s, as to di&s;cover the place of her re&s;idence, and the more welcome circum&s;tance of her heart being undedicated to any other.</P>

<P>MY time and devotions are &s;o com|pletely ab&s;orbed in felicity, that I conceive the pre&s;ent as nothing le&s;s than a voluntary &s;tealth from the &s;weet cour&s;e of my plea&s;ures.

In fact, our interviews are a commerce of &s;ouls, in the fer|vent indulgence of which every faculty of mind and body is rendered the medium of &s;ome par|ticular bli&s;s! She, loving, tender and amorous, receives my ardent care&s;&s;es with a total pro&s;tra|tion of reluctance; while I, inflated with divine intellectual fruition, re&s;pond to her bewitching endearments in the "&s;ilent elocution of the eye."

<OPENER><SALUTE>WORTHY MISS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER leaving your &s;oothing &s;o|ciety la&s;t evening, taking a circuitous path in my way homeward, I was profoundly &s;tartled on per|ceiving, in the field adjoining the property of Alfred, two men and two women engaged in a reciprocal exchange of courte&s;y and affection. In my cour&s;e coming nearer to the &s;cene, I was effectually &s;huddered by di&s;tingui&s;hing in this happy club, my truant wife, her petit maitre, the <HI>prudi&s;h</HI> Mi&s;s Fanny, with her gallant al&s;o! This &s;ingular groupe, had it con&s;i&s;ted of indifferent characters, would have drawn my admiration; but think of my thrilling horror on making the di&s;covery! The impul&s;e of the in&s;tant would
<PB N="156" REF="032746_0154_0FF4FA88FB311380">
have driven me furious into their pre&s;ence; but my heart, bearing fre&s;h in remembrance the pru|dent coun&s;els of your wi&s;dom, retired from the guilty &s;pectacle, with a fervent apo&s;trophe to the ju&s;t, and I tru&s;t, vindictive heaven.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent reflections preyed on my tranquillity as I meditated at home.&mdash;Oh, how "&s;tale, flat, and unprofitable" appeared to me the plea&s;ures, vanities, and hopes of this world! Methought, exi&s;tence was an immen&s;e load, and, if it had been po&s;&s;ible, I would have evaded its oppre&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>&mdash;OH, my generous, tender friend, I have certain ireful thoughts brooding in my di&s;tracted &s;oul!&mdash;Thoughts, which I tremble to reveal e|ven to your &s;acred confidence!&mdash;Thoughts, which, as I pore over them, become odious to my&s;elf! Have you, joined to an experience in life, a practical firmne&s;s to coun&s;el with de&s;pera|tion? Does your mind, though of the texture of a woman, po&s;&s;e&s;s inherent principles of valor? Can you, Harriot, un&s;ex your&s;elf, and be the friendly accomplice of my voluntary de&s;truction?&mdash;Start not at this!&mdash;Life has proved only a &s;ucce&s;&s;ional train of torments&mdash;my &s;oul looks for repo&s;e to death and eternity.&mdash;Tho&s;e gifts which
<PB N="157" REF="032746_0155_0FF4FA8A8DD4D520">
heaven as ble&s;&s;ings, have been intercepted by demons, and, ere they reached me, converted into cur&s;es! I will, therefore, thwart the efforts of hell, by plunging blindly into immortality; confiding my &s;oul into the care of that power who created it.</P>
<P>I KNOW this awful determination will affright you:&mdash;Yes, it will doubtle&s;s pierce the &s;oul of a woman who feels univer&s;ally in the cau&s;e of hu|manity.&mdash;You will urge me to cling to the tran|&s;ient horrors of this world, in preference to the doubt and peril of an adventurous pa&s;&s;age to a|nother. Speak not of re&s;ignation. Heaven did not create the &s;oul, endow it with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its future dignity, and expand it with noble &s;entiments of deity, for the purpo&s;e of drudging under an immen&s;e load of mi&s;eries in this idle world. Why is it inve&s;ted with the <HI>power,</HI> if not to exerci&s;e the <HI>right</HI> of annihilating this fle&s;hy cumbrance, and re-a&s;cending to omnipo|tency? Is it not nobler to end life by one act of the will, than, by awaiting the &s;low and excru|ciating cour&s;e of mi&s;ery, fall a groaning &s;acrifice to pu&s;illanimity?</P>
<P>IF no damning crime has marked the progre&s;s of my life, what motive is there <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> keep me back

If I have been but negatively vir|tuous; ab&s;taining from the vicious propen&s;ities of my nature, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing improper impul&s;es, where is the man who dare arraign my &s;oul at the bar of heaven?

Believe me, the latter affords the more cogent rea&s;ons for an immediate perpetration. The former acts without principle, or a view of here|after; whereas, the latter ju&s;tifies the deed; and, by divinely opening the portals of bli&s;s for my departing &s;oul, illumines the pro&s;pect of an eternity.</P>

<P>I folded down a leaf in the rich vo|lume of Zimmermann on Solitude, in order to read and an&s;wer your letter of this morning. My mind was &s;uffu&s;ed with a rapturous admiration of the &s;olemn plea&s;ures of retirement, the living ideas of which I had ju&s;t caught from the ener|getic &s;tyle of the author.&mdash;I opened the letter, while mentally calculating on the comparative happine&s;s of a hermit and a courtier or &s;tate&s;|man:&mdash;the cour&s;e of my contemplations was not
<PB N="161" REF="032746_0159_0FF4FA985B9E4830">
interrupted until the horrid word "de&s;truction" seizing my eye, created a &s;hivering winter in my veins!&mdash;Alas, how has unguided madne&s;s tram|melled the vigour of your intellects!&mdash;What un|happy influence has thus &s;tripped thee of the pre|rogative of rea&s;on?&mdash;Surely the acutene&s;s of your judgment, cannot be lo&s;t in the apparent propriety of your rea&s;oning, in palliation of the horrors of &s;elf-murder? Surely that mind which lately was all energy, that heart which is all piety, cannot &s;o &s;uddenly be the dupe of weak|ne&s;s, or the perpetrator of guilt?</P>
<Q><L>"Is re&s;ignation's duty hard?&mdash;</L>
<L>"Examine, you &s;hall find,</L>
<L>"That duty gives up little more</L>
<L>"Than angui&s;h of the mind."</L></Q>
<P>MY feelings are &s;o violently agitated by this unhappy circum&s;tance, that I am incapable almo&s;t of collecting rea&s;on &s;ufficient, to outweigh the &s;ophi&s;tication of your e&s;&s;ay to vindicate the im|pious a&s;&s;umption of Heaven's prerogative. Be|cau&s;e life is con&s;idered as a loan, tho&s;e deluded mortals who have ru&s;hed unprepared into the pre&s;ence of their Maker, conceive it to be &s;olely at their di&s;po&s;al, and that whether they improve or abu&s;e it, no authority dare call them to ac|count.
<PB N="162" REF="032746_0160_0FF4FA99EC50C5B8">
Life is not only a loan;&mdash;it is a &s;acred depo&s;it from the hands of creation, and if we thoughtle&s;sly mi&s;apply or pervert it, the united voice of rea&s;on, nature, and religion is loud in cen&s;ure;&mdash;how much more worthy, then, of cen&s;ure and puni&s;hment is that infatuated wretch, who, wildly warring on religion, nature and rea|&s;on, not only abu&s;es the ble&s;&s;ings of exi&s;tence, but with a bloody hand con&s;igns it to de&s;tructi|on?&mdash;How foul in nature's eye is the wretch who attacks the life of another? And is not his own life a more holy, &s;acred tru&s;t? He who moulded our bodies; who infu&s;ed the animation of &s;ouls; who appointed our abode in this earth for wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es; and who, at his plea&s;ure can convert afflictions into mercies;&mdash;he only is the ju&s;t arbiter of the period at which his &s;ervants &s;hall be re-united to Divinity.&mdash;Alas, it is only when mankind lo&s;e their belief in the &s;upremacy of this power, that they perform an act, which at once violates the principles of obedience, and alienates the guilty from the care and protection of the Deity!</P>
<P>IT may be true, my friend, that in this world your only portion has been pain and mi&s;ery.&mdash;But is this a motive to &s;uicide?&mdash;The act &s;up|po&s;es that you either remedy the actual torments
<PB N="163" REF="032746_0161_0FF4FA9DA30ABFB8">
under which you labour, or that by extingui&s;h|ing life, you de&s;troy its &s;en&s;ibility both for the pre&s;ent and the future. You mu&s;t undoubtedly expect either to &s;ucceed to an exi&s;tence of more perfect bli&s;s, or to a &s;tate in which, by the ex|tinction of the principles of animation, your mind will be un&s;u&s;ceptive of either the emotions of plea&s;ure, or the throbs of pain.&mdash;Surely, my friend, you cannot acknowledge the attributes of God, particularly his ju&s;tice, if after the com|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;o horrid a deed, your &s;oul conceives the hopes of his favour!&mdash;Alas, Franks, our religion tells us, that the gates of heaven are doubly barr|ed again&s;t the entrance of him, who&s;e hands are &s;tained with his own blood!&mdash;Let religion then unnerve your dreadful purpo&s;e!</P>
<P>THE other plea is, the general attendant of tho&s;e who are hardy enough to execute this dire de&s;ign.&mdash;Finding that religion affords no extenu|ation for their guilt, and impatient of mi&s;ery, they die, not with the luminous anticipation of a ble&s;&s;ed hereafter, but with the dreary expecta|tion of a &s;tate of apathy; preferring nonentity to an exi&s;tence of trials and di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;This idea, I tru&s;t, has no influence on the belief of my philo|&s;ophic friend:&mdash;No; have I not heard him with a tran&s;port of joy, de&s;cribe tho&s;e &s;cenes of pure

love.&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter, in tears of &s;peechle&s;s agony, hung around the dear neck of her departing friend; while he with a calmne&s;s of &s;orrow, which di&s;dained the aid of tears, pre&s;&s;ed her to his &s;welling bo&s;om, and uttered a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;|ings on her head!&mdash;Thus were they for &s;everal moments locked in each others arms, &s;igh an|&s;wering &s;igh, when the wind being favorable, he was hurried to the ve&s;&s;el which was to convey him from the &s;cene of his infantile joys. My &s;i&s;ter was conducted to her room, where for &s;e|veral months &s;he continued in a &s;tate of mind and body, extremely doubtful as to the i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>MY own experience of the &s;ublime pa&s;&s;ion, enables me now to judge of the di&s;tre&s;sful feel|ings of this pair, at the eventful juncture of their &s;eparation;&mdash;of the unavailing tears and &s;ighs, which mu&s;t have filled up the bitter period of ab|&s;ence!&mdash;Until a few days pa&s;t, my &s;i&s;ter, igno|rant of his fortune, devoted her tears and prayers in &s;ilence for his &s;afety. A few days indeed have unwound to her enraptured mind, the constancy and fidelity of her exiled Henry!&mdash;Read, my friend, and let not your wonder &s;ub&s;ide until you have acknowledged, that the fate of lovers is the peculiar care of ruling Providence.</P>

ON Wedne&s;day la&s;t, my &s;i&s;ter received from the hand of an unknown &s;ervant, an anonymous letter; which, it &s;eems, after expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;anguine e&s;teem for her character, and prote&s;ting honorable intentions, &s;olicited her to favor the writer with an interview the next day; appointing the hour and place.

<P>AS you expected, the contents of your la&s;t produced in my mind, a &s;eries of enter|taining and moral reflections, re&s;ulting in a &s;in|cere admiration of that wonderful pa&s;&s;ion which can, by a peculiar magic, entwine two hearts at the di&s;tance of innumerable miles!&mdash;It is an in|&s;tance by no means uncommon in the hi&s;tory of love, that notwith&s;tanding the efforts of pride, prejudice, or &s;uper&s;tition, to &s;uppre&s;s its earlie&s;t dawning, the cau&s;e of nature and innocence will

be finally matured by the hand of de&s;tiny.&mdash;The votaries of love, that unconquerable pa&s;&s;ion, are daily &s;een to &s;urvive the wrecks of malice and per&s;ecution; and although for a period their fate is apparently lo&s;t in the my&s;terious evolutions of fortune, a watchful and approving power is ulti|mately certain of collecting their &s;cattered hopes into a point of enjoyment.</P>
<P>IT is the trial of love, under which my worthy friend Tallman is now labouring.&mdash;Since he has left me, I have received a letter, dated Philadel|phia, in which he communicates a melancholy ac|count of the lo&s;s of his parents and family, by the dreadful contagion which &s;pread death and terror in that city, during the year 1793.&mdash;This afflict|ing incident, I ob&s;erve, appears con&s;iderably alle|viated, by the glimmerings of hope with which he has met, in the pur&s;uit of his love.&mdash;Should he finally be pro&s;pered in his pa&s;&s;ion, which is interwoven with his exi&s;tence, he will a&s;&s;uredly be the happie&s;t and be&s;t of men!&mdash;</P>
<P>YOU &s;peak in your la&s;t of certain perils, which appear in the way of your love, with a timidity which &s;eems to indicate a de&s;ire to relinqui&s;h your pur&s;uit! Ah, Charles, is this your proof of gallantry? Are you not aware, that in every no|ble

THE brother of my amiable Fanny, has al|ready acquainted you with the origin of my at|tachment, and of the cruel embarra&s;&s;ment in which it was early involved.&mdash;Alas, I had but one hope, be&s;ide the a&s;&s;urance of con&s;tancy, to &s;upport me in the dreadful moments of our &s;e|paration; and that was a fond expectation, that by a per&s;everance in indu&s;try and honour, I &s;hould &s;hortly be enabled to return in circum&s;tances, which if not acceptable to her parents, would en|title me to the clande&s;tine attainment of the dear girl's hand!&mdash;This hope, from the moment of my departure for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, appear|ed to be rapidly realizing. In India my talents for bu&s;ine&s;s were &s;o liberally rewarded, that in the cour&s;e of this period, I had ama&s;&s;ed a capi|tal, which compared with the e&s;tates of Ame|rica, would be immen&s;e.&mdash;Inflated by this &s;uc|ce&s;s with the ambition of returning to my coun|try and love, in honourable affluence, I inve&s;ted the amount in the mo&s;t valuable Indian articles, and, there being no immediate conveyance to America, failed with it for Bourdeaux in France.&mdash;Alas, it never reached its de&s;tination!&mdash;The world had already proved tru&s;tle&s;s to me; but now I almo&s;t dared to accu&s;e heaven of leaguing with treachery again&s;t me!&mdash;In the mid&s;t of our voyage, which until then had proved remarkably

au&s;picious, a &s;udden hurricane con&s;igned my car|go and my hopes to a bottomle&s;s ocean; and the whole crew, after a perilous day &s;pent on the &s;hat|tered remnants of the &s;hip, were fortunately re&s;|cued from de&s;truction by the humanity of a French &s;hip of war, by which we were carried into Toulon.&mdash;Here, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;everal benevolent Americans, I was lucratively employ|ed for a few months; when meeting with a fa|vourable opportunity of returning to America, and abandoning the idea of fortune, who had thus jilted me, I embarked in an American ve&s;&s;el for Philadelphia; my all con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall wardrobe, and about two hundred dollars in ca&s;h, exclu&s;ive of my pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the&s;e circum&s;tances by no means ju&s;tified per&s;onal felicitation, believe me, my friend, I experienced a delightful exultation in the fore&s;ight of parental joy at my return, and the welcoming &s;miles of my &s;till adored Fanny. Alas, the&s;e hopes were indeed &s;leeting meteors to perplex my imagination!&mdash;In the very mo|ments when my fancy was glowing with the ex|pectation of friendly delight and gratitude; li&s;ten|ing, in anticipation, to the melody of my char|mer's joy,&mdash;a new calamity blighted the pro&s;|pect, and intercepted the bland approach of

bli&s;s!&mdash;The ve&s;&s;el was boarded by an Engli&s;h privateer, the pa&s;&s;engers plundered of their all, the cargo carried into Bermuda, and condemned without re&s;erve. Here again, I narrowly e&s;cap|ed a more execrable misfortune:&mdash;for tho&s;e who were unfriended or unprotected, were forcibly carried to unite in a war as repugnant to national morality, as oppre&s;&s;ive to humanity.</P>
<P>AFTER much application, I &s;ucceeded in ob|taining a pa&s;&s;age for Baltimore, in compen&s;ation for which I was to pre&s;erve the accounts of the ve&s;&s;el, and occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;i&s;t in the labors of the crew. Alas, dear &s;ir, the recollection of my di&s;|tre&s;s at the moment of your benevolence, renews all the &s;en&s;ations of an immen&s;e gratitude!&mdash;I was landed, unknown and unfriended, in a large mercantile town; where the general pur&s;uit of wealth is often known to eat up the natural prin|ciples of philanthrophic charity. I had now no de&s;ire to proceed to Philadelphia; confident that the wretchedne&s;s of my condition would be di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the pity of my friends, and a &s;ubject of exultation for tho&s;e who had formerly either envied or hated me.&mdash;Alas, what was I to do? What &s;hould I have done, but &s;ome act of de&s;|peration, had not your generous charity re&s;cued me from infamy, want, and ruin? Even to that

charity my pride proved an ingrate, by counter|feiting a name! But I tru&s;t, my friend, from per|ceiving the benefit which has re&s;ulted from the artifice, you will forgive the wretch who exerci&s;|ed it.</P>
<P>MR. ALFRED, who re&s;ides in the city during the influx of bu&s;ine&s;s, has been informed of my return, acquie&s;ces in my addre&s;&s;es to his daugh|ter, and has politely undertaken to arrange the affairs of my father. The&s;e circum&s;tances have flu&s;hed me with the hope of &s;oon becoming the happy hu&s;band of my Fanny.&mdash;Oh, my friend, I have lo&s;t a parent, and will not you be pre&s;ent at the extatic moment, to deliver up your &s;on, (for am I not the child of your bounty) to this heavenly female?

ALAS, madam, how in&s;crutable are the my&s;|teries of Providence! How prompt is human na|ture to repine at the wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of heaven; not becau&s;e they are really unju&s;t or baneful, but becau&s;e their infinite wi&s;dom does not grovel to our frail judgment! Every example of woe; every bloody offering made to vice or the pa&s;|&s;ions, is a loud le&s;&s;on of morality to the &s;urviving children of mi&s;fortune.&mdash;Oh, madam, I am unwilling to commence a tale, the horror of which would impre&s;s terror on the hearts of in|different &s;en&s;ibility; but in your affectionate bo|&s;om, who&s;e &s;ympathy &s;hares with its &s;i&s;ter's ago|ny, will a&s;&s;uredly produce a de&s;peration of grief!</P>

Alas! but two days ago, after &s;pending the greater part with us in

plea&s;ant amu&s;ement, though her mirth was al|ways bounded by a certain melancholic &s;edate|ne&s;s, &s;he returned home, accompanied by my brother Charles; who, after a &s;hort interval, re|appeared with palene&s;s and horror in his face!

<P>ALAS, madam, my all of di&s;tre&s;s heretofore is in&s;ignificant compared with that produced by this di&s;a&s;trous event. Heaven only knows by what infernal motive the unfortunate man was tempted to the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;o impious an act; throwing him&s;elf guilty and unprepared into the face of heaven, and &s;taining the earth with &s;acri|legious blood. Always have I remarked him to be a man of &s;elfi&s;h principles; fond of contem|plation, and adver&s;e to the joys of &s;ocial life. He had for a long time maintained a &s;trange inter|cour&s;e
<PB N="184" REF="032746_0182_0FF4FADE451A55E0">
with an unworthy family in this neigh|bourhood, who, it is pre&s;umed, were privy to the perpetration of this act. Alas, much I fear, that &s;ome unhappy influence from them has im|pelled him, without regard to religion or morali|ty, to turn a murderous hand upon him&s;elf.

<OPENER><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY appearance in this city, will no doubt, a&s;toni&s;h you. It is produced by your la&s;t letter; not, however, as you will at fir&s;t expect, to participate in your de&s;erved felicity, but, I ra|ther fear, to rankle it by a new &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE enclo&s;ed is for Charles Alfred, to whom I mu&s;t reque&s;t you immediately to deliver it. He is a man, &s;ir, guilty of a &s;y&s;tem of the mo&s;t atroci|ous duplicity, exerci&s;ed under the &s;acred di&s;gui&s;e of friend&s;hip;&mdash;a man who has rendered the pri|vileges of confidence, the ba&s;e means of tarni&s;h|ing the character of my family. To re&s;ent &s;uch villainy is the purpo&s;e of my pre&s;ent vi&s;it.&mdash;I &s;hall forbear to relate the particular infamy of his con|duct; tru&s;ting that your &s;en&s;e of honour and pro|priety, di&s;regarding the connexion you expect in
<PB N="186" REF="032746_0184_0FF4FAE8B75FFAC8">

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII. To CHARLES ALFRED.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GUILT like yours cannot long lurk in &s;ucce&s;sful concealment. The agency of hea|ven will di&s;clo&s;e its infamy, and the hand of ju&s;|tice inflict its puni&s;hment.&mdash;A perfidious friend is the inmate of hell, and the accomplice of fiends.</P>
<P>I HAVE, &s;ir, inadvertently detected the villainy of your motives, for the pretended mode&s;ty of your withholding the name of the unhappy woman
<PB N="187" REF="032746_0185_0FF4F9C39214CCA8">
who&s;e virtue and fidelity you have violated. Un|der the profe&s;&s;ion of a holy friend&s;hip, you have murdered the character of my whole family, by in&s;ulting the cha&s;tity of my &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;Yes, wretch, you knew it:&mdash;While your infernal lu&s;t boiled in your blood, your tongue profaning the name of friend, you knew that the &s;educed Caroline Franks, was the &s;i&s;ter of Courtney. But this idea, could not weaken or repel your diabolical de&s;ign: By a perfidious encroachment on my under&s;tanding, you artfully angled, until you drew me into an approbation of the infernal deed.</P>
<P>HAVE you the feelings of a man or a brother?&mdash;Or does your guilty heart adhere only to qua|lities of vice and cowardice? Though your of|fence would ju&s;tify indi&s;criminate vengeance, without the preliminaries of honour, I will per|mit you the chance of e&s;cape, if you dare meet an in&s;ulted friend, this evening, armed and alone, in the wood adjoining your plantation.&mdash;Should your cowardice decline this interview, be a&s;&s;ur|ed I &s;hall &s;peedily adopt a &s;urer mode of ven|geance.</P>

<P>THE convul&s;ion which the mind of young Alfred had recently endured from the &s;hocking cata&s;trophe of Franks, had ju&s;t began to abate, when the trembling Wellsford delivered him this letter. The well-known hand of his friend caught his delighted eyes; and he opened it with elated feelings; but ah, how were they changed to horror and di&s;may, when he read the cruel in|vectives of his furious friend?&mdash;When he reflect|ed on the my&s;terious circum&s;tance of his beloved Charlotte being the &s;i&s;ter of his deare&s;t friend? It fla&s;hed on his &s;oul with intolerable poignancy; and, but for the &s;upport of con&s;cientious integrity, he would in&s;tantly have fallen an innocent victim to &s;en&s;ibility. De&s;troying the letter, he devoted &s;everal hours in &s;olitude to his chamber; and, previous to the fatal hour of his de&s;tiny, made a brief vi&s;it to his oppre&s;&s;ed Charlotte; whom he found immured in pen&s;ive madne&s;s. While &s;he was rational, he bade her adieu, urging her to drive from her imagination the figure of her dead hu&s;band, who, in his life-time had acted unwor|thy the name, and in his death unworthy the character of a man. The affecting di&s;cour&s;e, proceeding from one, who, next to her&s;elf, &s;he conceived as the cau&s;e of her hu&s;band's ignoble end, naturally produced the agony of reflection, which re&s;ulted in a paroxi&s;m of madne&s;s! He
<PB N="189" REF="032746_0187_0FF4FAF5A849E378">
left her with a heart riving with pity and torn by remor&s;e; and repairing to the &s;cene nominated in the challenge of his friend, &s;pent his time in fervent and loud expiation to heaven for his un|con&s;cious guilt. "If, oh heaven," he exclaimed with tears, "I have erred, impute it not to the vilene&s;s of my heart; but to the weakne&s;s of my head;&mdash;to the &s;eeds thou ha&s;t planted in my na|ture!" when, like a tyger, Courtney ru&s;hed upon him. "Wretch, infernal wretch," he cried, "defend your&s;elf!" and drawing from his poc|ket a loaded pi&s;tol, repeated the exclamation. Charles, di&s;&s;olving from his devotion, begged his friend to be clam till he offered an explanation; but Courtney, &s;welling with pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;i&s;ted, as he had cowardly come unarmed, on his making a choice of pi&s;tols. "Alas, my friend," he &s;aid, "I have no wrath for you, and therefore will not rai&s;e my hand again&s;t your life:&mdash;your ven|geance only is to be appea&s;ed&mdash;here, pour it in my bo&s;om." Courtney, unmoved by the condi|tion of his friend, per&s;i&s;ted in the choice; where|on, taking the in&s;trument, Charles cried to him, "fire," and di&s;charging it in the air, received that of Courtney full in his brea&s;t, and fell!</P>
<P>COURTNEY ha&s;tening from the hand of ju&s;|tice, flew into the pre&s;ence of his &s;i&s;ter, and,
<PB N="190" REF="032746_0188_0FF4FAF73644E220">
while the fury of madne&s;s was tearing her &s;oul; called down accumulated vengeance on her head. He di&s;appeared from the world; and Charlotte, acquainted of the cau&s;e of his fury, with a &s;ingle groan, followed her Charles into the regions of eternity!</P>
