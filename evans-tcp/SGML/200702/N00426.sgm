<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>I COR. XI. 24.</BIBL>
<Q>This do in Remembrance of Me.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe Blessed God, who has made <HI>Sacraments</HI> to be such very ne|cessary and agreeable Engines for a maintaining of a Com|munion between the <HI>Visible</HI> and <HI>Invisible World,</HI> has in both <HI>Testaments</HI> appointed several such means of our Fellowship with Him|self.
<PB N="2" REF="000535_0010_0FA6B6ED80D1BB68">
A <HI>Sacrament</HI> is a <HI>Sign</HI> and <HI>Seal,</HI> by which is declared, and confirmed, and conveyed some <HI>Spiritual</HI> Thing unto us. Tho' the <HI>Word</HI> SACRAMENT be not in the Scripture; it be|ing borrowed from the Name of the <HI>Oath,</HI> which passed between <HI>Commanders</HI> and <HI>Souldiers</HI> of old: yet the <HI>Thing</HI> we are abundantly ad|vised of; and there are <HI>two</HI> Sacraments which under the Evangelical Dispensation of the new Covenant, our God would have us approach unto him in. Those are a Sacred <HI>Baptism,</HI> and a <HI>S</HI>acred <HI>Supper;</HI> the former of which is to sig|nifie our <HI>Inoculation</HI> into the Lord Jesus Christ, and our <HI>Obligation</HI> to <HI>Serve</HI> and <HI>Fight</HI> under Him; but the latter of them is to signifie our <HI>Participation</HI> in all the saving Benefits of our Lord Jesus, and our <HI>Augmentation</HI> in our Con|formity and Obedience to Him. It is <HI>Remark|able</HI> (and a Worthy Person of another Nation in a Treatise Entituled <HI>La manducation du Corps de Christ,</HI> i find long since putting such a <HI>Remark</HI> upon it) that as of old under the Law those two <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Washing</HI> and <HI>Feeding</HI> were those which did represent the <HI>Application</HI> of the <HI>Re|demption</HI> to come, and by those <HI>two Acts</HI> were the People made partakers of the then Holy things: thus the <HI>two Sacraments</HI> of the <HI>New-Testament</HI> have those two <HI>Acts</HI> to manage them.</P>
<P>They are not few or small Duties which you
<PB N="3" REF="000535_0011_0FA6B6EE47A6EC60">
that are <HI>Baptized</HI> must count your selves bound unto. Tis no less than <HI>A putting on Christ,</HI> unto which you are engaged by your <HI>Baptismal Vow.</HI> God forbid that you should look upon your <HI>Baptism</HI> as an useless <HI>Formality</HI> or a trifling <HI>Ceremony</HI> The Waters of <HI>Baptism,</HI> will prove more bitter and baneful than the waters of <HI>jealousie</HI> to the guilty Souls of them that forget what engagements are by their <HI>Baptism</HI> laid upon them.</P>
<P>You are <HI>Baptized into the Name</HI> of the glo|rious Trinity, to intimate the Bonds which now ly upon you to acknowledg God the Father, as your <HI>Father,</HI> God the Son as your <HI>Saviour,</HI> and God the Spirit as your <HI>Strengthener.</HI> You have received His <HI>Mark</HI> on your <HI>Foreheads,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> shew that you ought to make a public and open Pro|fession of His Name; and Renounce all the <HI>Idols</HI> of this evil World. It is a <HI>Baptism unto Repentance</HI> which you have been the <HI>S</HI>ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> of; and you are thereby bound unto such a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> for, and <HI>Hatred</HI> of, all Sin, as is <HI>the Repentance not to be repented of.</HI></P>
<P>But one special reference of your <HI>Baptism,</HI> is that which we have now before us: it is to be reckoned as a <HI>Preface</HI> to the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord. Our Lord gave that Order once unto his Mini|sters, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19 20. <HI>Baptize men, teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever</HI> I <HI>command</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

your B<HI>aptismal Vow,</HI> while you wittingly and willingly neglect any Institution of the Lord Jesus Christ. As the <HI>Circumcised</HI> were to observe all the Laws of <HI>Moses,</HI> even so, the B<HI>ap|tized</HI> are to observe all the Laws of <HI>Jesus;</HI> a|mong which there is none that has a bigger or a brighter <HI>Asterisk</HI> upon it, than that which we have now to insist upon, <HI>This do in remembrance of Me.</HI></P>
<P>In our Context here the Apostle Animadverts upon certain <HI>Abuses</HI> which the <HI>Corinthians</HI> pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> the Sacred S<HI>upper</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ withal. That Sacred S<HI>upper</HI> was too much discomposed among them, by means of another S<HI>upper,</HI> which they unwarrantably annexed or prefixed thereunto. There were indeed certain charitable <HI>Feasts,</HI> which in some of the primitive <HI>Ages</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> were used among Believers, together with the <HI>Eucharist.</HI> But I do not think <HI>these</HI> to be those <HI>Agapae,</HI> which the Apostolical Writings make mention of; those <HI>Agapae</HI> I rather take to be the entertainments provided for S<HI>trangers,</HI> at the cost of the <HI>Churches,</HI> in or near their usual meeting places, which are by some judged a laudable imitation of the <HI>Hospi|tals</HI> adjoyned unto the S<HI>ynagogues</HI> of the Jews: and thus we find <HI>Gaius</HI> deputed and employed by a <HI>Church</HI> for their <HI>Host</HI> of old. Much less do I look upon the Banquetings of the <HI>Corinthi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> before the Eucharist, which are blamed here
<PB N="5" REF="000535_0013_0FA6B6F009CE8750">
to be those <HI>Agapae.</HI> You must indulge me in an Opinion, however singular it may seem, that there was a Jewish party in the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> which would not come to the S<HI>upper</HI> of the Lord without a <HI>Paschal</HI> A<HI>nte</HI>-S<HI>upper,</HI> wherein they ate and drank <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ly enough: thus they retained a Shadow of their <HI>Passeover,</HI> and maintained a Relique of their <HI>Judaism.</HI> The <HI>Gentile</HI> party of the Church disallowed these proceedings, and would come <HI>Hungry,</HI> when the others came well nigh <HI>Drunken</HI> to the <HI>Eucharist;</HI> upon which ensued a confusion in their <HI>Church Assemblies,</HI> too disorderly for any time, but much more <HI>so,</HI> for a time when they were to attend such a <HI>Tremendous Mystery.</HI></P>
<P>Now to rectifie these Abuses, the <HI>A</HI>postle reduces them to the <HI>Original Institution</HI> of that blessed <HI>Sacrament.</HI> This is the scope of the Paragraph, which affords our Text unto us; the Apostle recites what our <HI>L</HI>ord <HI>said,</HI> and what He <HI>Did,</HI> when He appointed this Holy <HI>Ordinance.</HI> Accordingly, in the words of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> which the <HI>Apostle</HI> here quotes, agree|ably to the Account given by <HI>Three</HI> Evange|lists, we have two Things.</P>
<P>First, A Christian <HI>Duty, This</HI> D<HI>o,</HI> That is, <HI>My Disciples, Do you</HI> Assemble <HI>to Celebrate such a S</HI>acrament <HI>as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re set before you.</HI></P>

<P>&para; These are the <HI>Sacred Elements</HI> in the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord. But what <HI>place</HI> is to be assigned for them?</P>
<P>One would have thought that this were scarce any matter of Enquiry; because a <HI>Ta|ble</HI> is the <HI>place</HI> for a <HI>Supper</HI> to be expected at.

And I suppose 'twas done in such a <HI>Succession,</HI> that the <HI>Bread</HI> was Eaten before the <HI>Wine</HI> was <HI>Taken.</HI> This is to signifie, That the Son of God has <HI>Taken</HI> our Nature into a personal Union with Him|self.

of our Lord;</HI> or, <HI>God manifest in the Flesh,</HI> is herein referred unto.</P>
<P><HI>S</HI>econdly, The <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> are to be <HI>Blessed.</HI> They are thus (namely by a <HI>Thanks|giving</HI> over them) <HI>consecrated</HI> unto the Ser|vice now before us. We know not what <HI>Words</HI> or <HI>Forms</HI> were used in the first <HI>Con|secration</HI> by our Lord Jesus; it is evident that the Sentence which the Romanists attribute such a more than <HI>Creating</HI> and <HI>Conversive</HI> power unto; namely, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> was not, is not of a <HI>consecrating</HI> Influence; it is only <HI>Assertive</HI> of what the Sacrament is be|fore that clause be uttered. No, 'tis prayers and praises for the Blessings of <HI>Redemption</HI> accommodated unto this occasion, that con|secrate what is before us. This is to signify, That our Lord Jesus hath been <HI>set apart</HI> unto the Office of a Mediator. While <HI>This</HI> is doing, our Lord as it were says, <HI>Thus for their sakes I sanctifie my self.</HI></P>

<PB N="24" REF="000535_0030_0FA6B704CBFA5478">
The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> sins not a little by the Omission of it. This is to signify, That our Lord Jesus has been <HI>Broken</HI> for our Sin. Tho' His Bones were not to be <HI>Broken,</HI> (and this was the Martyrs Argument against <HI>Transub|stantiation</HI>) yet His <HI>Flesh</HI> was broken, and His <HI>Heart</HI> was broken, for us.

<P>Fourthly, The B<HI>read</HI> and the <HI>Wine</HI> are to be <HI>given.</HI> As our Lord, put first the <HI>Bread,</HI> and anon the <HI>Wine</HI> into the <HI>Hands</HI> (not into the <HI>Mouths</HI>) of the Disciples; thus the <HI>Pa|stors</HI> are still to do, by the Mediation of the <HI>Deacons.</HI> We do not find that <HI>Christ</HI> or <HI>They</HI> rose up, for Him to deliver the B<HI>read</HI> and the <HI>Wine</HI> to each of them immediately; but <HI>He</HI> gave it unto the <HI>First,</HI> and the <HI>First</HI> gave it unto the <HI>Next;</HI> and thus we find in the Pri|mitive Ages, there were <HI>Distributors</HI> of these Holy Things to the Communicants.

<P>Fifthly, The <HI>Bread</HI> and the <HI>Wine</HI> are to be <HI>Received.</HI> We are (unless in case of <HI>Lame|ness</HI>) to <HI>Take</HI> the B<HI>read</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> even into our <HI>Hands;</HI> it profanes them not for our Hands to <HI>Touch</HI> them; and the Popish Mode of <HI>Taking</HI> them otherwise, is more fit for <HI>Beasts</HI> or <HI>Birds,</HI> than for the Children of <HI>Men.</HI> But this is to signify, That we <HI>Receive</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ as our <HI>Prince</HI> and our <HI>Sa|viour.</HI> As we have the <HI>Eye</HI> of a True Faith, in <HI>Looking</HI> to Him, and the <HI>Foot</HI> of a True Faith, in <HI>Coming</HI> to Him; so it becomes now to have the <HI>Hand</HI> of a True Faith, in <HI>Taking</HI> of Him.

<P>Lastly, We are to <HI>Eat</HI> the <HI>Bread,</HI> and to <HI>Drink</HI> the <HI>Wine,</HI> thus prepared for us. There is an <HI>Eating,</HI> which is incumbent on us here. In the Ratifying and Confirming of a <HI>Cove|nant,</HI> and (yet oftner) in the expressing and maintaining of a <HI>Friendship</HI> among men, <HI>Eating</HI> has been but usual.

<P>What shall I say more? God wou'd not allow any man to Taste of <HI>Blood,</HI> until the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord Jesus came to be shed.

<P>None but B<HI>elievers</HI> are to Enjoy the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord. I am sorry that so much <HI>Controversy</HI> lies in our way, as we go along; but there MUST BE such things as <HI>Truth</HI> is to conflict withal. I have now particular|ly advanc'd an Assertion, for which you must have the patience for a while to see me C<HI>on|tend earnestly</HI> against a sort of men, who tell us, That a bare <HI>profession</HI> of a Dogmatical or Historical <HI>Faith</HI> (which <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Profession</HI> they themselves find it hard enough to de|scribe, but must leave the business in a per|petual confusion) together with a submission to the G<HI>overnment</HI> of the Visible Church, will entitle a man to <HI>Sacraments!</HI> Against this Opinion, I lay down this Conclusion.</P>
<P><HI>T</HI>hat <HI>Regeneration</HI> is the Thing without which a Title unto <HI>Sacraments</HI> is not to be
<PB N="30" REF="000535_0036_0FA6B70BCE24F4D8">
pretended unto. <HI>Real Regeneration,</HI> is that which before <HI>God (in foro coeli</HI>) renders men capable of claiming <HI>Sacraments.</HI> And <HI>Visi|ble,</HI> or <HI>Expressed</HI> Regeneration is that which before <HI>Men, (in foro Soli</HI>) enables us to make such a claim. Or, take it so, A <HI>probable and credible</HI> P<HI>rofession of a Saving Faith,</HI> (and no less than <HI>That) must be made by a man, before the Supper of the Lord may be</HI> A<HI>dmini|stred unto him.</HI></P>
<P>I deny not, That <HI>unknown Hypocrites</HI> may be admitted unto the Table of the Lord, there is no Help for <HI>That!</HI> we are so much in the <HI>Dark</HI> about the States and Hearts of many Professors, that the <HI>Enemy will sow such Tares</HI> in our Fields, &amp; they will continue there till the <HI>Judge</HI> of the whole World shall at last ap|ply Himself to the Bundling and Burning of them.

strangers to the <HI>New-Birth.</HI> I do not affirm That the <HI>Sacraments</HI> prove <HI>Nullities</HI> in all Respects&punc; to those that have been the <HI>unmeet Subjects</HI> of them; but, I say, That those who have the <HI>Power of the Keyes</HI> are to do their part, That no <HI>unmeet Subjects</HI> be made <HI>Par|takers</HI> (which is to be <HI>Profaners</HI>) of those awfull Things; and I say, That all who do not upon the Tender of Needfull and pro|per <HI>Questions</HI> to them give <HI>Just cause</HI> to think, That they are True, Sincere, Converted, <HI>Be|livers</HI> on the Lord Jesus Christ, are to be de|barred from them. Now to establish this Assertion, let these Arguments be Placidly &amp; Candidly weigh'd in the <HI>Ballances of the San|ctuary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That <HI>Qualification</HI> without which a man cannot Challenge <HI>Baptism,</HI> is much more to be demanded of them that would approach unto the <HI>Supper of the Lord.</HI> For no <HI>unbaptised</HI> person may be a Communicant in <HI>This</HI> Ordinance; and what is Necessary at the <HI>Threshold,</HI> is much more Necessary at the <HI>Table:</HI> they that may not be reckoned as <HI>Incipients,</HI> much more may not be treated as <HI>Proficients,</HI> in the House of God. But a man may not Challenge <HI>Baptism,</HI> without a <HI>Pro|bable and Credible Profession of a Saving Faith.</HI> The very <HI>Form</HI> of the words used in Baptism shows, That a man must not onely <HI>Beleeve
<PB N="32" REF="000535_0038_0FA6B71006667938">
God,</HI> but also <HI>Beleeve IN God,</HI> when he is Baptised. Now [<HI>Defferunt,</HI> credo Deum, <HI>et</HI> Credo IN De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m] <HI>that</HI> signifies the Con|sent of the <HI>Will,</HI> as well as the Assent of the <HI>Mind.</HI> Yea, The man must Beleeve IN God the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit;</HI> and so, he must acknowledge the whole <HI>Trinity,</HI> in all its glorious <HI>Operations.</HI> This is the <HI>Faith</HI> surely which, <HI>Hath Everlasting Life.</HI> Thus also, the Words used by <HI>Philip</HI> to the Eunuch, are as full to this Purpose, as is Possible, in Acts 8.37. <HI>If thou Beleevest with all thine Heart thou mayst be Baptised.</HI> It is a gross Abuse upon the Speech, to say, That it cuts not off the Pretensions of <HI>those</HI> to Baptism, of whom it may not Reasonably be thought, <HI>That they Beleeve with all their Hearts;</HI> but unless they Beleeve with <HI>Affection</HI> as well as <HI>Understand|ing,</HI> they do it not <HI>with all their Hearts.</HI> You may add to this, That <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Saving Faith,</HI> ever go together. But, without <HI>Re|pentance,</HI> a man may not be Baptised. Those persons methinks must have the Itch of Dis|puting that will give me any Trouble to make This appear. But for <HI>their</HI> Satisfaction, let it be Remembred, <HI>That</HI> our Lord and His Apostles, did still prepare men for <HI>Baptism</HI> by Preaching of <HI>Repentance.</HI> What said <HI>Peter</HI> in Acts 2.38. <HI>Repent and</HI> [then] <HI>be</HI> B<HI>aptised;</HI> Certainly, we should not be more lax in <HI>our</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="000535_0039_0FA6B71185BB5C88">
B<HI>aptism,</HI> than <HI>John</HI> was in <HI>His.</HI> But <HI>His</HI> B<HI>ap|tism</HI> was called in Mark 1. 3. <HI>The baptism of Repentance;</HI> and such <HI>a Repentance</HI> also, as the <HI>Remission of sins</HI> was annexed unto. He did not B<HI>aptize</HI> all that came unto him; only those who did <HI>Confess</HI> their sins (and give just cause of hope, that they did <HI>Forsake</HI> them too) were welcome to his baptism, and such as had <HI>Fruits</HI> to justifie the <HI>Repen|tance</HI> professed by them; as for them who made no proof of a True <HI>Repentance,</HI> 'tis re|corded in Luc 7 30. <HI>They were not baptized of him.</HI> What shall I say more? B<HI>aptism</HI> is to be accompany'd with <HI>The Answer of a good Conscience</HI> to all the proposals of the Gospel; 'tis to be accompany'd with a Renunciation of <HI>The World, the Flesh and the Devil;</HI> 'tis to be accompanied with an Hearty Listing our selves under the <HI>banner of the Lord Jesus Christ&punc;</HI> Now, there is no less than a <HI>Saving Faith</HI> im|ply'd in such things as these.

What were the Church-members at <HI>Rome;</HI> but such as, <HI>From the Heart had obey'd the Form of Doctrine deli|vered to them?</HI> What were the Church-mem|bers at <HI>Cori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">th;</HI> but such as <HI>were washed and sanctifyed and justify'd?</HI> What were the Church members at <HI>Galatia,</HI> but such as <HI>had the</HI> S<HI>pirit of the Son of God, sent into their Hearts?</HI> What were the Church members at <HI>Ephesus;</HI> but such as <HI>Trusted in Christ, and were sealed with the Holy</HI> S<HI>pirit of promise?</HI> Or the Church-Members at P<HI>hilippi,</HI> but such as one might be <HI>confident,</HI> had a <HI>good work begun in them?</HI> Or, the Church members at <HI>Colossi,</HI> but such as were <HI>made meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light?</HI> What were the <HI> Thessa|lonian</HI> Church-Members, but such as had <HI>Turned unto God, from Idols, and received the

Indeed, A <HI>Church</HI> (as the Greek Name for it allows us to think) is to consist of people <HI>called out</HI> from the ways of sin, by the powerful and effectual work of God upon their Souls. A main Design of <HI>Church-Fellowship,</HI> is to represent unto the world, <HI>who</HI> those are, that the Lord Jesus will have to <HI>ascend into the Hill of the Lord, and to stand in His Holy place</HI> for ever. A <HI>Church</HI> is a combined multitude of <HI>True Believers;</HI> that is the <HI>Famosius Significatum</HI> of the Name. They that have not a <HI>True Faith</HI> can but E|quivocally be called <HI>Members</HI> of it; even, as, a <HI>Wooden Leg,</HI> or <HI>a Silver Tooth</HI> may be styl'd Members of the Body. Let me say, after the Judicious <HI>Calvin, Quod Exponunt quidam de sola Professione mihi frigidum videtur, E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ab usu Scriptur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> est Alienum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That <HI>Qualification,</HI> the Absence whereof, should bring a Communicant under the censures of <HI>Church-Discipline,</HI> is doubtless to be demanded of them that would approach unto the <HI>Supper of the</HI> L<HI>ord.</HI> Certainly, we may not <HI>Receive</HI> to, the L<HI>ords Table,</HI> any such persons as we should <HI>Suspend</HI> from it, if they
<PB N="38" REF="000535_0044_0FA6B7153501A420">
had already crouded thereunto. <HI>B</HI>ut when a person that is already a Communicant, makes not a <HI>probable and credible</HI> P<HI>rofession of a saving Faith,</HI> our <HI>Church-Discipline</HI> is to cen|sure him. I pray why are we to <HI>Excommuni|cate</HI> a notorious and obstinate Offender against the Laws of the Lord Jesus, from the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord? <HI>T</HI>he man will perhaps make a P<HI>rofession</HI> of the Christian Faith in spite of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ceth: we canot hinder that. But when we see that his P<HI>rofession</HI> is not <HI>probable and credible</HI> to be a S<HI>aving one,</HI> we are to forbid him our Communion; and as the Rule is in <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.17. L<HI>et him be unto thee as an Heathen Man. T</HI>he Reason, the <HI>true</HI> Reason, wherefore we are to turn an Offender from the Table of the Lord, is, <HI>because the Offender, in his present</HI> I<HI>m|penitence, is to be accounted unfit for the Kingdom of God;</HI> and <HI>because the Man brings a just sus|picion upon his</HI> P<HI>rofession, till he be Recovered out of his Distemper.</HI> In a word, when C<HI>hurch-Members</HI> so carry themselves; as that they have the common symptoms of <HI>Unpardoned Souls</HI> upon them, we are then to <HI>Bind them on Earth.</HI> 'Tis quite <HI>wrong,</HI> that they should be <HI>Admitted</HI> to Church-Communion, that we know ought immediately to be <HI>Rebuked, Refu|sed, Censured</HI> in it. For a <HI>Mantissa</HI> to this Ar|gument, let me say, An Ordinance commu|nicable to none but the <HI>Penitent:</HI> cannot be de|manded by any but those that make a <HI>probable
<PB N="39" REF="000535_0045_0FA6B718E539A5D8">
and credible Profession of a Saving Faith.</HI> But the <HI>Supper</HI> of the Lord is an Ordinance com|municable to none but <HI>Penitents.</HI> This is clear because the <HI>Impenitent</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e to be excluded from it; else we must agree to lay all <HI>Church-Disci|pline aside,</HI> which God forbid.

<P>And the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> gave this general Rule, <HI>That the inward state of Penitents be ob|served in order to their Admission to communion with us.</HI> Now, if they that are <HI>Impenitent</HI> for <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> particular sin, may not come to the Table of the Lord, surely they that may be thought <HI>Impenitent</HI> for a whole <HI>course</HI> of Sin, are also to be <HI>kept out of Doors,</HI> which is to be esteem'd the case of all them whom we may not <HI>Reasonably</HI> as well as <HI>Charitably</HI> judg <HI>Renew|ed by the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That Qualification, without which a man to be there about Examined, is to be supposed as continuing under the <HI>Cove|nant of works,</HI> is undoubtedly to be demanded of all them that would approach unto the <HI>Supper of the Lord.</HI> Our God has in two <HI>Co|venants</HI> dispensed Himself unto us; both of which have had their <HI>Sacraments.</HI> The old
<PB N="40" REF="000535_0046_0FA6B71B02124600">
Covenant was not without a <HI>Sacrament</HI> in the <HI>Trees</HI> which God then did set such a special Remark upon. But the <HI>Lords Supper</HI> is purely a <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>New-Covenant;</HI> And it is Folly to think, that until a man accept of the <HI>Covenant</HI> he may meddle with the <HI>Sa|crament.</HI> The <HI>Lords Supper</HI> is a Sacrament provided by the <HI>Second Adam</HI> for such as be|come united unto <HI>Him;</HI> as for those that keep their Union with the <HI>First Adam</HI> still, our Lord sayes unto them, <HI>What hast thou to do to take my Sacrament into thy mouth?</HI> Now till a person make a <HI>Probable</HI> and <HI>Credible Professi|on of a saving Faith,</HI> he pretends to none but the <HI>Covenant of Works.</HI> He remains what he was, when <HI>First born</HI> into the World; but the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord stands in that <HI>Kingdome of Heaven,</HI> whereof our Lord sayes unto us, <HI>Veri|ly, except a man be born again, he cannot see</HI> [he is uncapable of] <HI>that Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That <HI>Qualification,</HI> without which they that approach to the <HI>Supper of the Lord,</HI> are evidently guilty of the most <HI>detestable Dis|simulation</HI> in the World, must be demanded of them that would approach thereunto. But we encourage a very <HI>detestable Dissimulation,</HI> if we permit men to approach unto the Lords Supper, without a <HI>probable and credible Profes|sion of a saving Faith.</HI> When we make way for any person to have Communion with us at the Holy Table, do not we expect, <HI>his con|sent

unto the terms of the Gospel,</HI> and Subjection to the Lord Jesus Christ as his <HI>Prophet,</HI> and <HI>Priest</HI> and <HI>King</HI> for ever? every <HI>Communicant</HI> with us is to <HI>say</HI> thus much: <HI>The Lord Jesus is my Prince and my Saviour:</HI> but without <HI>pro|bable and credible Profession of a saving Faith,</HI> it is a great LYE for a man so to <HI>say.</HI> We may not encourage men to <HI>ly unto the Holy Ghost,</HI> by causing them to <HI>speak</HI> what (and while) yet they do not <HI>Feel;</HI> but we must first look to that, <HI>Let them</HI> (hopefully) <HI>Believe, and so let them speak.</HI> It is well said by a worthy man, <HI>The Sealing of the Covenant unto men, before they understand it, and take hold of it, is the common cutthroat of Souls in our Parishes.</HI> The least thing to be exacted of a Communicant is, <HI>An Engagement to leave off the wayes of sin.</HI> Well&punc; he must engage to do it presently, or else hereafter: If he engage only to do it <HI>hereaf|ter,</HI> there is a most cursed and hellish Impiety in that <HI>Procrastination,</HI> and the Sinner does therein as bad as declare, <HI>That he will remain an Enemy to God all his dayes.</HI> I pray, what <HI>Sa|crament can belong to such an one?</HI> If he engage to do it <HI>presently,</HI> we shall have cause to judge that either he do's Engage it <HI>Sincerely,</HI> or that he does it <HI>Fallaciously, Deceitfully, Hypocritically.</HI> But what <HI>Promise</HI> did our God ever make, or what <HI>Respect</HI> and <HI>Value</HI> did he ever command us to show unto <HI>such Engagements?</HI> It was
<PB N="42" REF="000535_0048_0FA6B71CCCDBCB38">
the Resolution of <HI>David, He that works Deceit, shall not dwell within my House; He that tel|leth Lyes shall not tarry in my sight.</HI> And shall we fill the <HI>House</HI> of our <HI>David,</HI> with such as (we may be justly jealous) are <HI>Deceivers</HI> and <HI>Lyars</HI> in their pretences of Allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ? No doubt, it was the thought of this that made the venerable <HI>Chry|sostom,</HI> to say, S<HI>uppose he were the greatest man in the World, that would receive the Blessed</HI> C<HI>up from my hand; I would rather give my</HI> Heart-Blood <HI>than I would give that cup to him, whilest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e approves himself to be NO</HI> DISCIPLE.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthl'y,</HI> If the <HI>Supper of the Lord</HI> be not appointed for a <HI>converting Ordinance,</HI> then a <HI>probable and credible Profession of a saving Faith,</HI> (or Conversion) is to be first made by them that would approach unto it. They that plead for more <HI>promiscuous Admissions</HI> to the Lords Table, usually suppose, That the <HI>Holy Supper</HI> is to be used for the <HI>Conversion</HI> of such as come unto it. But against this, I assume, That the <HI>L</HI>ords Supper is not <HI>Ex Instituto,</HI> a <HI>converting Ordinance.</HI> That this Ordinance has <HI>never</HI> by <HI>Accident,</HI> been sanctify'd for the <HI>First Conversion</HI> of them that had never bin brought home to God before, I do not now <HI>say;</HI> tho' I suppose it would puzzle any man to <HI>prove</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="000535_0049_0FA6B71D835CF258">
that, <HI>It ever has.</HI> If it <HI>have,</HI> what of that? I can tell the Name of a man converted by hearing himself Preach; yet I hope the Church will be loth to admit unto the Mi|nistry such as they may not be first well per|swaded about the <HI>Conversion</HI> of. I have knowe some, whom a <HI>Dream</HI> has been very instrumental in converting unto God; yet a <HI>Dream</HI> I suppose, is not now a <HI>converting Or|dinance.</HI> But this Ordinance is not by <HI>Ap|pointment</HI> such an one as is to be employ'd for the <HI>First Conversion</HI> of such as have never yet given themselves up to the Lord Redeemer. 'Tis impossible to tell why the very <HI>Heathens</HI> are not capable of it, if it were a <HI>converting Ordinance;</HI> and why we should not be as cha|ritable in driving men to the <HI>Lords</HI> S<HI>upper,</HI> as the Papists are in driving them to <HI>Baptism;</HI> among whom we read of one old Priest that Baptized <HI>seven hundred thousand.</HI> No, There is A<HI>nother Ordinance</HI> directed thereunto; <HI>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God;</HI> but it is no where said, <HI>That Faith comes by Receiving of the</HI> S<HI>acrament;</HI> nor is there so much as one instance in the Bible to countenance any such expectations. Indeed, this <HI>Dog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> is <HI>A New Thing;</HI> the Asser|tors run Counter to the <HI>common sense</HI> of the Church in all Ages, and have an <HI>Army to a man</HI> against them. I would humbly ask,
<PB N="44" REF="000535_0050_0FA6B71E398F4678">
<HI>If the</HI> S<HI>acraments</HI> had been <HI>converting Ordinan|ces,</HI> would <HI>Pauls</HI> Commission have Run that way, S<HI>ent not to Baptize, but to</HI> P<HI>reach the Gos|pel? Baptism</HI> it self is no converting Ordi|nance; we do not find in <HI>S</HI>cripture that it was ever applied unto any but such as had likely signs of the New-birth upon them; 'tis, <HI>The washing of Regeneration,</HI> a <HI>washing</HI> only for them that be <HI>Regenerate.</HI> Certainly, Then <HI>the Lords</HI> S<HI>upper</HI> is not intended for inferiour Subjects. I would ask again, if the <HI>Lords</HI> S<HI>upper</HI> were a <HI>converting Ordinance,</HI> were it not a preposterous thing to exclude a|ny person from that <HI>Ordinance</HI> in order to their being <HI>converted?</HI> but we have a Divine Warrant so to do.

<P>Finally, The <HI>Lords</HI> S<HI>upper</HI> is an Ordinance rather <HI>Encharistical</HI> and <HI>Consolatory,</HI> than <HI>con|verting.</HI> 'Tis also an Ordinance principally designed for <HI>Nourishment,</HI> and that supposes <HI>Lise, Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> bcen't for D<HI>ead men.</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="000535_0051_0FA6B71F015A5428">
In short, The L<HI>ords Supper</HI> is a S<HI>eal;</HI> and it is to <HI>Seal</HI> our Interest in the <HI>Righteousness of Faith,</HI> in the D<HI>eath of</HI> C<HI>hrist,</HI> and in the <HI>Crown of Life.</HI> If it Seal only the Reality of Gods Covenant, and his proffering and pro|pounding it unto us, it seals no more to a <HI>Receiver</HI> than to a Spectator, or to all Re|ceivers alike.

It can S<HI>eal</HI> no comfortable thing to the Ungodly Man, for it not only <HI>Seals</HI> the offers of the Gospel, but it also <HI>Seals</HI> our Tempers towards those Offers. When God <HI>gives</HI> it, it <HI>Seals</HI> (at least) His <HI>willingness</HI> to be Reconciled unto us thro' Jesus Christ,; but when we <HI>Take</HI> it, it <HI>Seals</HI> that Condition in which we at present are with reference to that Reconciliation. The <HI>Sacrament</HI> is a <HI>Seal,</HI> in regards more awful and exact than the <HI>Word</HI> can be.

So let them hasten to the Table of the Lord, and hereby they shall Seal the Stone upon their Grave, and have DAMNATION written in great Cha|racters upon their Foreheads.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Seventhly</HI> and Lastly, We have the <HI>Best Ex|amples</HI> to convince us, That nothing less than
<PB N="46" REF="000535_0052_0FA6B71FC9EBCB80">
a <HI>probable and credible Profession of a saving Faith</HI> is to be required in those that would be Com|municants at the Table of the Lord. Con|sult the Monuments of Antiquity, and you'l find the Ancients <HI>Uno Ore</HI> describing their <HI>Baptized</HI> Ones, as Regenerate, and Renewed by the Inherent Graces of Gods Holy <HI>S</HI>pirit. And what then were their <HI>Communicants?</HI> The Primitive Church would not admit <HI>Paul</HI> into their Society, till they were well satisfi|ed about the Reality of the <HI>work of Grace</HI> in his Heart, and his <HI>Profession</HI> was become <HI>pro|bable and credible</HI> unto them. In the Primi|tive times, they were too <HI>strict</HI> indeed, ra|ther than too L<HI>oose</HI> in their Admissions; and they held men a long while <HI>Competentes</HI> (as they call'd them) before they would gratify their desires of Communion.</P>
<P><HI>Origen</HI> expresly tells us, <HI>That the Christians did most exquisitely search the</HI> S<HI>ouls of those that asked a full Communion w'ith them:</HI> elsewhere he sayes, <HI>When men have made such a proficiency that they appear sanctified by the Divine Word, then we call them to our mysteries.</HI> And else|where, <HI>The mysteries of the Religion of Jesus, are duely delivered only to those who are holy and pure. Lactantius</HI> tells us. <HI>That Bona mens purum pec|tus, vita Innocens,</HI> were in his dayes required of Communicants. In <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> who lived in the second Century, writes, That they
<PB N="47" REF="000535_0053_0FA6B72075491148">
did examine persons, not only about their <HI>Perswasion,</HI> but whether they had attained such a work of God upon their Souls, as would enable them to conform entirely unto the Word and Will of God. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> who lived in the Century after him, could say <HI>Vix pleba persuadec</HI>&mdash;He could not easily perswade the Brethren of his Flock to consent unto the Ad|mission of such in whom <HI>Sincerity</HI> was questi|onable. <HI>Tertullian</HI> and others inform us how the <HI>Catechumens</HI> were dealt withal; and what a <HI>Serutinium</HI> or <HI>Trial</HI> they underwent; <HI>Whether they did indeed Renounce all their former vanities.</HI> It was the Rule, <HI>Fiant s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rutinia, an verba fide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Radicitus corde de fixerint.</HI> And <HI>Austin</HI> signi|fies unto us, <HI>That according to the antient custome grounded upon the most evident Truth, none were Admitted into the Church of God on Earth, who were visibly such as the</HI> S<HI>cripture excludes from the Kingdom of God in Heaven.</HI> Moreover, the Agreement of the Pastors in the Days of <HI>Constantine</HI> about the Discerning of the <HI>sincere</HI> is very memorable.</P>
<P>And in the latter Ages, 'tis well known what wishes the Eminent Reformers have ex|press'd themselves.

<P>It may be Objected, That <HI>Judas</HI> was Ad|mitted unto the L<HI>ords Supper,</HI> notwithstanding our L<HI>ords Knowledge,</HI> that he was a <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>To this, it may be Answered,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That though a D<HI>ivine</HI> K<HI>nowledge</HI> had pronounced <HI>Judas</HI> a D<HI>evil,</HI> yet an <HI>Humane</HI> K<HI>nowledge</HI> had not penetrated, so far into him; He had not hitherto discovered him|self. And methinks, our Friends do speak a Little too broad, when they seem to plead for our Admitting of a <HI>known Judas,</HI> a <HI>known</HI> D<HI>evil,</HI> a <HI>known Traitor,</HI> to our Holy Communion: Would they bring any people to an Ordinance, that will be likely to leave them like <HI>Judas,</HI> more under the <HI>power</HI> of the D<HI>evil</HI> than before? It may be again An|swered, That it is very Questionable whe|ther <HI>Judas</HI> ever <HI>did</HI> partake in this Ordinance or, 'tis rather past Question, <HI>That He did not,</HI> at least good old <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry,</HI> besides divers o|thers

of the Ancients did not scruple so to say, Observe, Tis said, <HI>He Having Received the Sop, went out immediately.</HI> The <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p</HI> was a part of a Rite belonging to the <HI>Paschal Lamb.</HI> The Sacramental Bread was <HI>Broke,</HI> but no where <HI>Dipt.</HI> Our Lord, without any Ex|ception tells the Communicants, <HI>His Body was given for them, and His Bleed shed for them.</HI> Whereas <HI>Judas</HI> was Dead and Damn'd, be|fore the Death of our Lord.

Let no man then after this be so impertinent,as from the Instance of <HI>Judas</HI> to Raise an <HI>Use of Re|prehension</HI> unto the Churches that would not have <HI>Hypocrites</HI> in them, if they could help it. Brethren, if we could help it, we would not have our Churches to be <HI>Betray'd.</HI></P>
<P>It may furthermore be Objected,</P>
<P>That in the Church of <HI>Israel,</HI> all sorts of persons were Admitted unto the Sacraments; and why should it <HI>now</HI> be otherwise?</P>
<P>To this it may be Answered,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Form of the Church then was <HI>National;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r being of that <HI>Nation</HI> might give him greater pre|tensions

to C<HI>hurch communion.</HI> Whereas, in our Days, A <HI>National Church</HI> is but a contri|vance of an <HI>Humane</HI> Invention and Original. But we may with more Efficacy Retort this upon them that make the Cavil. As it was a <HI>capital <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> for one that was not a <HI>Jew</HI> to come into the <HI>Temple:</HI> and hence <HI>Paul</HI> once had like to have been knock'd o'th' head, because it was rumoured, That he had a <HI>Greek</HI> with him there; so 'tis unlawful for one that is not according to the Sacred Lan|guage, <HI>A Jew inwardly,</HI> to come into a Church of the Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>It may be <HI>Again</HI> Answered, That even among the <HI>Israelites,</HI> those that came to the <HI>Sacraments</HI> were under Obligation to give manifestation of what might be esteemed, <HI>A Work of Grace in their</HI> S<HI>ouls.</HI> If they would not Express a sense of their <HI>Misery</HI> and <HI>Wretchedness</HI> by Nature, and their Need of a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and a S<HI>aviour,</HI> they might not Com|municate.

<P>It may be further Answered, That a C<HI>e|remonial Holiness</HI> was required of all the <HI>Isra|elites</HI> that came unto the <HI>Sacraments;</HI> and there were <HI>Officers</HI> whose Business 'twas to make Exploration of it.

<P>It may be, L<HI>astly,</HI> answered, That the Church of the <HI>Jews</HI> did use to be most won|derfully <HI>Accurate</HI> and <HI>Scrupulous,</HI> in their Trying of <HI>Proselytes,</HI> before they would ad|mit these to S<HI>acraments</HI> among them. <HI>Buxtor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and <HI>Ainsworth</HI> out of the Jewish <HI>Rabbies,</HI> will convince you, That in former Ages, if any one were desirous to joyn unto the Church of the <HI>Jews,</HI> they would pierce into the very Soul of him, to discern whether he were acted by any <HI>carnal Motives</HI> in it; and hence, they received fewer in the Days of <HI>David</HI> and of S<HI>olomon,</HI> than they would have done in times of less prosperity.

<P>But it may be then Enquired,</P>
<P><HI>What is it that we may safely Judge to be,</HI> A probable and credible profession of a Sa|ving Faith?</P>
<P>To this I answer; That we must beware of <HI>Unscriptural Impositions</HI> in this Affair; we must not impose any <HI>Modes</HI> of <HI>Profession</HI> which we have no warrant for. 'Tis a <HI>Ty|ranny</HI> to Enjoin upon every man, <HI>A Rela|tion about the precise Time and Way of their Conversion unto God.</HI> Few that have been Restrained by a Religious Education, can give such an one. Nor, is it any other than a <HI>cruelty,</HI> to Enjoin upon every man, <HI>An Oral and a Publick Relation of his Experiences.</HI> Every Good man has not such a courage and presence of mind, as can speak perti|nently before a Congregation of many Hun|dreds.</P>
<P>But still; as the <HI>Probationers</HI> for our com|munion, are to make a <HI>Profession</HI> of their Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, as that Re|deemer <HI>in whom all</HI> F<HI>ullness dwells,</HI> and on whom they Rely for communications from that <HI>Fullness</HI> to their own Souls; thus, we must Look for some <HI>justifying circumstance</HI>

of that Profession. Our C<HI>harity</HI> towards all men of whom we know nothing amiss is. <HI>To Hope all things,</HI> and Believe the Best. But when we come to make a <HI>Judgment</HI> of them that lay claim to <HI>priviledges</HI> with us, 'tis but Reason that our Charity should require a more <HI>positive Evidence</HI> of the Qualification on which the claim is made. In the Primitive Times, They made such a <HI>Profession</HI> at their being <HI>Added unto the Church;</HI> and the <HI>Profes|sion</HI> had this <HI>Justifying Circumstance</HI> in it, that they made it, when they Endangered their very L<HI>ives</HI> to make it.

<HI>Is my Knowledge and Belief so Powerful, Ef|fectual, Saving, as it ought to be?</HI></P>

<P>While we are Impenitent, there is, <HI>Nothing pure</HI> unto us. As the Lord of old said, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 1. 15. <HI>Put away the Evil of your Doings&punc;

<P>It were very desirable for us in a S<HI>elf-Examination,</HI> to go over all of these <HI>Articles;</HI> and there will be this Advantage in this Exercise, <HI>That our Enquiring after the Grace of God in our souls, will put us upon the Exercising of all that grace.</HI> When we Enquire, whether we have the <HI>Graces</HI> of the Holy Spirit in us, indeed this is the best way to satisfie our own Enquiries; Let us with our <HI>Ejaculations</HI> unto God, as we go along, <HI>Pro|fess and Renew, the gracious inclinations of our own</HI> S<HI>oul</HI>s, Let him who <HI>doubt</HI>s whether he <HI>Live</HI>s, prove it by moving, walking, Doing the Actions of them that are <HI>Alive.</HI> Your S<HI>elf-Examination,</HI> may as it were draw forth all your <HI>Grace</HI>s into the Field, and gloriously <HI>Exercise them</HI> as to all the postures and power<HI>s</HI> of them there: by which means you will even <HI>Feel</HI> your own Regeneration.</P>

<P>The Jewes compare the Three Books of S<HI>o|lomon,</HI> to the Three Parts of the Temple built by him; the <HI>Proverbs</HI> they liken to the <HI>Porch,</HI> the <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> they liken to the <HI>Holy Place;</HI> and the <HI>Canticles</HI> they liken to the <HI>Holy of Ho|lies,</HI> within the Vail, where all things were full of Mystery, Reverence and Religion.

<P>In our Text, we have the <HI>Respect</HI> of the Church unto the Lord Jesus Christ; upon which, Two Things are to be noted.</P>
<P>First, we have the S<HI>eason</HI> of it. It is, <HI>when the King sitteth at His Table.</HI></P>
<P>Behold the <HI>Person</HI> which we are now con|cerned with; it is a <HI>Great King</HI> who vouch|safes to be treating with us miserable Beggars and Sinner here. O that we could enough Ad|mire the Benignity and the Condescension of the <HI>King</HI> that ha's brought us hither! If we now put that <HI>Question,</HI> in Psal.24 8,10. <HI>Who is this King of Glory? Who is this King!</HI> We may take that answer, in Mal.1.14. <HI>I am a</HI> G<HI>reat King, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI> Our Blessed Lord Je|sus Christ is the <HI>King,</HI> whom we now make our Addresses to; and it is our Business here to acknowledge Him as our <HI>King.</HI> Very <HI>Royal</HI> is the largess, which we are here to <HI>Expect</HI> from His magnificent and munificent Hands;
<PB N="137" REF="000535_0143_0FA6B7904FA90C68">
we must now look for those things, that <HI>Life</HI> and that <HI>Peace,</HI> which it may well be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eem the Dignity of such a <HI>King</HI> to give. We are here also to <HI>Resolve</HI> that we will be Governed by His Laws; and with an unspotted <HI>Loyalty</HI> unto Him, we are now to say, <HI>The Lord is our King, and He shall save us.</HI></P>
<P>But behold also the <HI>Posture</HI> which He stoops unto. We find He, <HI>Sitteth at His Ta|ble.</HI> The Hebrew Original represents Him as <HI>Lying Down</HI> in a <HI>Round</HI> or a <HI>Ring</HI> of persons, whom He do's feast Himself withal. There is a Blessed <HI>Feast</HI> which the Lord Jesus do's Refresh the <HI>S</HI>ouls of His <HI>People</HI> with; and He do's vouchsafe of His <HI>Presence</HI> to them as, and in this Heavenly Festival. This <HI>Presence</HI> of His, is indeed that which sweetens all!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We have the <HI>Effect</HI> of it. It is thus Expressed, <HI>my Spiknard sends forth the smell thereof.</HI> Which is to be understood rather <HI>Actively,</HI> than <HI>Passively. It</HI> signifies not only, That the Lord Jesus doth here Per|fume His Church with the Liquid and pre|cious <HI>Nard</HI> of His own <HI>S</HI>pirit; and that, <HI>We have an Unction from the Holy One;</HI> But it also and cheefly Signifies, that the Church doth here very sweetly Delight the Lord Jesus, by Exercising of much <HI>Grace</HI> upon Him. The <HI>Grace</HI> of God, is as a pure and rich <HI>Spice</HI> in
<PB N="138" REF="000535_0144_0FA6B7915096AC70">
the Souls of them that have it; when this G<HI>race</HI> is Exercised, it is like a <HI>Perfume</HI> in the Resentments of our Lord Jesus Christ; and He says upon it, <HI>My Spouse, how much better is the smell of thine Ointments, than all Spices?</HI> Our <HI>Lavender,</HI> which is a Bastard <HI>Spiknard,</HI> is very sweet; but the true and right S<HI>pik|nard</HI> of the <HI>East-</HI> I<HI>ndies,</HI> is unspeakably more Delicious; however, the G<HI>race</HI> of God Ex|ercised in us, is far more fragant and grate|ful to that Holy Lord.</P>
<P>But we have this <HI>Doctrine</HI> then to think upon.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Exercise</HI> of Graces ought to be the <HI>Endeavour</HI> of Christians at the Cable of the Lord.</P>

Tis an impudent <HI>Familiarity</HI> that an unfit Communicant imposes upon the God of Heaven with. Every thing else at the <HI>Table</HI> usually is <HI>clean;</HI> we have only <HI>clean</HI> Linnens; and <HI>clean</HI> Vessels there; tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nexcu|sable if our <HI>Hearts</HI> and our F<HI>rames</HI> be not al|so cleansed.

<HI>First,</HI> There are very d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reful and heavy <HI>Plagues,</HI> which in this <HI>Life</HI> are inflicted on men, for their <HI>unworthiness</HI> at the Table of the Lord.</P>

<P><HI>First,</HI> There is an Historical <HI>Remembrance</HI> of the Lord Jesus to be had at his Holy Table.

Let us also look upon the <HI>Effects</HI> of His Death, and ad|mire the <HI>Mysteries</HI> Illustratious in them. Re|member that <HI>Reconciliation</HI> which His Death has effected for us, and all the circum|stances of the <HI>Friendship</HI> now established be|tween God and Man.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We are here to <HI>Remember</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ, with a deep R<HI>epentance</HI> for, our sins, which His Death is to be ascribed unto.</P>
<P>Particularly, We are now to R<HI>emember</HI> our Dying Jesus, with a <HI>Sorrow</HI> for all our sins.

<P>Again, we are now to <HI>Remember</HI> our dying Jesus, with an <HI>Hatred,</HI> yea, with a <HI>Cripling</HI> and <HI>Killing</HI> of all our Sins. <HI>Revenge</HI> is one study of a Penitent; we are now to <HI>Resolve</HI> that we will <HI>Revenge</HI> the wrong done to our Lord Jesus, by the destruction of the sins that have done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Wrong.

we should seriously and sincerely Resolve now to put our <HI>sin</HI> unto a Death which may bear a notable <HI>Analogy</HI> to the Death of our <HI>L</HI>ord.

<P>Moreover, The Jews drew up many Heavy I<HI>ndictments</HI> against the Lord Jesus. When that was done, they throw all Sorts of I<HI>n|dignities</HI> upon Him.

For these things, the Believers among us, do combine themselves into a <HI>Church-state</HI> by a most Holy <HI>Covenant;</HI> wherein they give themselves <HI>up to God, and Christ and one ano|ther,</HI> with an Agreement among themselves to Assist one another in their Attendance to the Rules of the Gos|pel.</P>
<P>And there is herewithal, such a <HI>Consociation</HI> of our Churches, as that not only a person joined unto any one of them, is admitted unto an <HI>Occasional Communi|on,</HI> at any time with any o<HI>f</HI> them, in the Supper of the Lord; while in the mean time, the Differences be|tween <HI>Independent</HI> &amp; <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> are so swallowed-up, as that only the S<HI>ubstantial</HI>s of Religion are become the <HI>Terms</HI> of our Communion: but also, upon Emergen|cies, we have our <HI>Synods,</HI> wherein the Messengers or Delegates of many Churches do together give that Ad|vice, that <HI>Rarely,</HI> if <HI>Ever,</HI> sails of putting an Issue to a|ny Controversies, which they meet upon. While I am thus pleasing my self, with a prospect of these justly <HI>Renowned,</HI> and yet basely <HI>Maligned</HI> Churches, methink<HI>s</HI> I nevertheless cannot advise them to say with <HI>Laodicea, We have need of Nothing!</HI> Besides what other <HI>Defect</HI>s in our Constitution an Impartial Enquiry may convince us of, I cannot my self at this time forbear Enq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iring, <HI>Why the Churches are no better furnished with</HI> R<HI>U</HI>LING ELDERS <HI>throughout the Land?</HI> We have in our <HI>Platform

of Church Discipline</HI> delivered it as our <HI>principle,</HI> That <HI>We should have Ruling Elders to joyn with the</HI> P<HI>astors and</HI> T<HI>eachers in those Acts of Church-Rule, which are distinct from the</HI> M<HI>inistry of the Word and</HI> S<HI>acraments.</HI> But our <HI>practice</HI> is become so contrary thereunto, that few of our <HI>Churche</HI>s are supply<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d with such Needful <HI>Officers.</HI> Whence comes this to pass? I doubt the <HI>Inconveniencies</HI> which many worthy Preachers of the Gospel, have too often found that <HI>Office</HI> bringing with it, have been some thing of the prejudice; whereas, to <HI>Multiply</HI> those <HI>Officers</HI> would be a better way to Remedy the inconve|niences than to <HI>Nullisy</HI> them; instead of <HI>One,</HI> Let there at least be <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three</HI> Ruling Elders in every Church. <HI>B</HI>ut many among us, perhaps by some Antecedent pre|judice disposed thereunto, have come to <HI>Question,</HI> yea, to <HI>Deny</HI> the <HI>Divine Warrant,</HI> for such an <HI>Office.</HI> They Object, <HI>What Order for L</HI>ay-Elders <HI>have we in the Word of God?</HI> I answer, To speak properly, The only <HI>Lay-Elder</HI>s that are known to be in any Church, are the <HI>Chancellors</HI> in the Church of <HI>England;</HI> persons Entrusted with the <HI>Rule</HI> of the Church, and yet not <HI>Ordained</HI> unto any Office in it. But for persons to be <HI>Ordained</HI> in eve|ry Church, <HI>To watch over the Conversation of the Church&punc; Members with Authority,</HI> is a thing which I suppose we may easily find a <HI>Divine Warrant</HI> for. <HI>U</HI>nless a Church have <HI>Diver</HI>s <HI>Elders,</HI> the <HI>Church Government</HI> must needs become either <HI>Prelatick</HI> or <HI>Popular;</HI> and that a <HI>C</HI>hurch needs but <HI>one Elder</HI> is an opinion contrary to the sense of the Church in all Ages. Now let us repair unto <HI>the Law and the Testimon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> see what <HI>Elder</HI>s we ought to submit unto.

Avoided and Evaded, as the Sophistry of some Oppo|sers has represented it. The most of them, who put in <HI>Exception</HI>s against the plain sense of the words, yet will not fix any other sense of their own, by which they dare abide: if they would fix upon any other, I durst undertake the disproving of it; nor do they in|deed, <HI>Agree among themselves.</HI> But he must be very I<HI>mmodest,</HI> who do's not grant, that <HI>Divers kinds of El|der</HI>s are intended in these words; and there is this <HI>Unanswerable Argument</HI> advanced in them.</P>
<P><HI>Preaching Elder</HI>s <HI>that Rule well, are not worthy of dou|ble Honour, unless they labour in the Word and Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>B<HI>ut there are Elders who Rule well, that are worthy of double</HI> H<HI>onour, tho' they do not Labour in the Word and Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Therefore there are Elder</HI>s, <HI>that Rule well, who are not Preaching Elder</HI>s, <HI>that i</HI>s, <HI>who are but Ruling Elders only.</HI></P>
<P>May our Churches then every where, look out, for <HI>Prudent, Gracious,</HI> H<HI>umble men;</HI> who may have a parti|cular care incumbent on them, about the <HI>Admission</HI> and <HI>Exclusion</HI> of Members; to inspect the <HI>Way</HI> and <HI>Walk</HI> of all the Communicants; to prevent all Be|ginnings of <HI>Division</HI>s and <HI>Contention</HI>s; to warn all persons unto the <HI>Dutie</HI>s more peculiarly pertinent unto their Circumstances, by a <HI>personal Instruction</HI> from House to House: to visit the S<HI>ick,</HI> the <HI>poor,</HI> the T<HI>empted,</HI> &amp; the P<HI>ersecuted;</HI> to inform the <HI>Minister</HI>s about the <HI>state of the Flock</HI> from Time to Time; and to consult with them about all the Affairs of the Society, over which they do preside. Surely, our Churches would flou|rish more, if these <HI>Officers</HI> were less wanting in them!</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="000535_0173_0FA6B7B573048C00">
But I have done; and shall now add no more, but only ask your <HI>Amen</HI> to my <HI>Prayer,</HI> That the Lord Jesus would alwaye<HI>s</HI> be the <HI>King</HI> of our Churches, and grant that <HI>We</HI> who therein so often <HI>sit with Him at his Table,</HI> may at last come to <HI>Eat Bread in His Kingdom,</HI> and <HI>Drink of the Pleasures at His Right Hand for evermore.</HI>  Amen, and Amen!</P>
