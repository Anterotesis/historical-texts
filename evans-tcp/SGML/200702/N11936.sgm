<P><HI>THE following Sermon was compo&s;ed in ha&s;te for a common congregation in the country, without any expectation of its being de&s;ired to be publi&s;hed. But many of my hearers were very earne&s;t in their reque&s;ts that it might be printed, to which I have yielded. I have not had lei&s;ure to tran&s;cribe and poli&s;h it, and if I had, perhaps &s;hould not take the pains, &s;ince the drudgery of tran&s;cribing would put me to more trouble, than it would afford plea&s;ure or advantage to the rea|ders. The &s;entiments and rea&s;onings are expre&s;&s;ed in a plain manner, and if they are ju&s;t, this plain|ne&s;s will not be di&s;agreeable; but if they are wrong, the Author has no de&s;ire that the embel|li&s;hments of &s;tile &s;hould recommend them.&mdash;The candid reader will make the favourable allow|ances, which are u&s;ually reque&s;ted for ha&s;ty pro|ductions.</HI></P>

<BIBL>JUDGES V. 15. 16.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>For the divi&s;ions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart. Why abode&s;t thou among the &s;heep-folds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? for the divi&s;ions of Reuben, there were great &s;earchings of heart.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DIVISIONS in families, or neighbourhoods, in church, or in &s;tate, are very di&s;agreeable at all times, as they mar the peace of men's minds, alienate their affections from one another, and involve them in jars and quarrels.&mdash;Strife and contention naturally proceed from divi&s;ions, &s;ince every one endeavours to maintain his own party, and pull down tho&s;e who oppo&s;e him; and con&s;e|quently divi&s;ions are productive of much &s;in, as well as mi&s;ery in the world. For, as the Apo&s;tle James ob&s;erves. <Q>Where envying and &s;trife <HI>is,</HI> there <HI>is</HI> con|fu&s;ion, and every evil work.</Q> And hence we are often exhorted in the &s;criptures, to union; and, in order to our loving one another, and to guard again&s;t all divi&s;ion and party &s;pirit, to <Q>mark them which cau&s;e divi&s;ions, and avoid them.</Q> Thus per|nicious is divi&s;ion in general.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="015070_0004_0F95A82C551A7B28">
But there are particular in&s;tances, in which divi|&s;ions are more immediately de&s;tructive, as when a country is involved in a nece&s;&s;ary war, for the defence of their ju&s;t rights and liberties. Divi&s;ions in &s;uch a ca&s;e, have a natural tendency to weaken their &s;trength, to render all the mea&s;ures which are planned for their defence abortive, and thus make them an ea&s;y prey to their invaders. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, long &s;ince ob&s;erved, with the greate&s;t propriety, <Q>Every kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf, is brought to de&s;o|lation; and every city or hou&s;e divided again&s;t it|&s;elf, &s;hall not &s;tand.</Q> Many powerful nations, have brought immediate and terrible de&s;truction upon them&s;elves, by their divi&s;ions. And hence <HI>Deborah</HI> in this &s;ong, in which &s;he celebrates the great victory which the Lord gave his people I&s;rael, under <HI>Barak</HI> their general, over <HI>Jabin,</HI> the powerful king of Ca|naan, who had "mightily oppre&s;&s;ed them," while &s;he mentions the general union of the tribes, with the highe&s;t prai&s;e, marks the divi&s;ions of <HI>Reuben,</HI> with the greate&s;t di&s;approbation. <Q>Why abode&s;t thou among the &s;heep folds to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divi&s;ions of Reuben, <HI>there were</HI> great &s;earch|ings of heart?</Q></P>
<P>As we are called this day by his <HI>Honour</HI> the <HI>Gover|nor</HI> of this Colony, to give thanks to God, and <Q>Offer up &s;incere and hearty prai&s;es to the Lord, for the many mercies he has be&s;towed upon us, the pa&s;t year;</Q> and particularly for his <Q>cau&s;ing &s;o great harmony and union in America,</Q> I &s;hall endeavour to pro&s;ecute the de&s;ign of the proclamation, by briefly con&s;idering <HI>this union&mdash;the righteou&s;ne&s;s of it, the great importance of maintaining it, and the bad con&s;equences of breaking it by divi&s;ions among our&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To give you &s;ome ju&s;t views of <HI>this union,</HI> I &s;hall briefly mention a few things, &s;hewing the great im|probability there was, that it would have taken place.</P>
<P N="1">1. The plan of oppre&s;&s;ion, which the Briti&s;h Mi|ni&s;try
<PB N="5" REF="015070_0005_0F95A82D0BBE2A20">
had concerted, was immediately aimed at the government of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay.</HI> There is in|deed good rea&s;on to believe, that all the Colonies were in the end, to &s;hare the &s;ame fate. But the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try kept this out of &s;ight as much as po&s;&s;ible, as they probably meant to &s;ubdue the Colonies one after another, expecting but little trouble with the re&s;t, when they had once brought the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> to &s;ubmit. And as they &s;uffered the other governments in general to enjoy their rights and privileges, it did not &s;eem probable to the mini&s;try, that they would in|termeddle, &s;ince if they did, they mu&s;t expect to in|volve them&s;elves immediately, in like difficulties; and it is natural for people to ward off calamities, as long as they can, to put far away the evil day.</P>
<P>It is to be remembered that the &s;outhern Colonies were va&s;tly remote from the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> by their &s;ituation; and different in their produce, and trade, from the&s;e northern Colonies. And &s;undry of them had a different form of religion e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, more conformed to that which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>South Britain,</HI> than what is generally profe&s;&s;ed in <HI>New England.</HI> The connection by trade was great, and the &s;imiliarity in religion, in the &s;outhern go|vernments, was much nearer to the Mother-Country, than to the&s;e northern Colonies.</P>
<P>Now, when we con&s;ider the&s;e things, it is certain|ly a very remarkable thing, in the cour&s;e of divine providence, that all the Colonies &s;hould, as it were, make the ca&s;e of &s;uffering and oppre&s;&s;ed BOSTON, their own; unite for the common defence of the country, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to the frowns of the mother country; when, by aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, or barely not joining with the re&s;t, the appearance was, that any particular Colony might be entitled, at pre&s;ent, to great privileges and emolu|ments. Some of the Colonies were &s;o di&s;tant from others, that they had but little intercour&s;e and ac|quaintance
<PB N="6" REF="015070_0006_0F95A82DC97C7398">
with one another; they never had any general interview, before the aera of the <HI>Stamp-act,</HI> nor any place, nor A&s;&s;embly appointed, in which to meet, nor method of electing Delegates to repre&s;ent them. And the King's Governors, in the &s;everal Colonies where they pre&s;ide, u&s;ed every precaution in their power, to ob&s;truct, and prevent their coming to &s;uch a choice. Yet, notwith&s;tanding, the &s;everal Colonies cho&s;e their Delegates, who a&s;&s;embled in Congre&s;s, at the city of Philadelphia, September 5, 1775.</P>
<P>It was doubtle&s;s expected, if they &s;hould thus meet in <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI> from Colonies &s;o different in climate, trade, and religion, that they would never agree, but contend and jar, and &s;o break to pieces among them|&s;elves. It is rare to find &s;uch a large A&s;&s;embly, all of the &s;ame mind, in the mo&s;t trifling affairs, much le&s;s in &s;uch weighty and dangerous matters. It is then very remarkable, that when they were thus met, and had full liberty and lei&s;ure, to con&s;ider the whole &s;tate of affairs; they &s;hould all agree as one man: Surely the common danger appeared very great and alarming, and oppo&s;ition very ju&s;t; but &s;till they had no power to enforce their re&s;olves and determinations, &s;o that after all, the people in the &s;everal Colonies might have refu&s;ed to comply with the directions of the Con|gre&s;s; and there were &s;undry attempts made by the King's Governours, who, from their high &s;tations, had much influence in their re&s;pective governments, and by the emi&s;&s;aries, whom they employed, to pre|vent people's acceding to the rules of the Congre&s;s. Sundry, have laboured with all their might, and that with all the arts of deceit and fal&s;ehood, to in&s;til pre|judices into the inhabitants, again&s;t the Congre&s;s. And yet notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e endeavours of the mi|ni&s;terial tools, the people in general have complied with their re&s;olves. There are but very few towns on the whole continent, and tho&s;e very &s;mall and ob|&s;cure, but have openly concurred, and appointed
<PB N="7" REF="015070_0007_0F95A82F93603480">
<HI>Committees of In&s;pection,</HI> to keep a con&s;tant look out, and to u&s;e the greate&s;t care and diligence, to &s;ee the Re&s;olves of the Congre&s;s carried into execution.&mdash;And thus, take the continent throughout, the union is remarkably great; greater than our enemies could ever believe would po&s;&s;ibly take place, and greater than we our&s;elves had any rea&s;on to expect; and the oppo&s;ite party &s;mall and incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>For let it be con&s;idered, that tho&s;e, who have e&s;|pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of their country, have all the power at pre&s;ent in their hands. The Offices, civil and mi|litary, are at their di&s;po&s;al, and the whole <HI>Militia,</HI> the arms and ammunition in the country, under their com|mand; &s;o that &s;uch as are otherwi&s;e minded, have no power at all at pre&s;ent, to do any thing of con&s;equence. Whereas the Congre&s;s having the power of the <HI>Mili|tia</HI> in their hands, have rai&s;ed a &s;trong army, and ap|pointed <HI>able experienced Generals</HI> to command, and made <HI>money</HI> to pay and &s;upport the troops. And God in his providence has &s;o greatly &s;ucceeded their coun|&s;els and arms, that they have reduced tho&s;e &s;everal &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Ticonderoga, Crown-Point, Chamblee,</HI> and <HI>St. John's,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Montreal has &s;ubmitted &s;ince.</HI></NOTE> in one campaign, which employed the united power of Great-Britain and the Colonies, for &s;undry years the la&s;t war, be&s;ides preventing their army at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> from ravaging the country.</P>
<P>Should it be objected, that there are &s;undry, in every government, who are far from approving the proceedings and determinations of the Congre&s;s, and and therefore that the union is not &s;o great and gene|ral as has been repre&s;ented; it were ea&s;y to an&s;wer, that when we con&s;ider the union of a country in any plan or mea&s;ure, it is not expected, that we &s;hould go into every ob&s;cure pari&s;h and by corner, who live out of the way of the knowledge of public tran&s;actions, and who therefore "abide among their &s;heepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks," who are wholly em|ployed
<PB N="8" REF="015070_0008_0F95A830428AE8D0">
about their private affairs; and much le&s;s; that we &s;hould enquire of every family that live in the woods, who neither know nor care any thing a|bout the country; we need only examine the &s;enti|ments and conduct of tho&s;e <HI>bodies</HI> of men, whom they choo&s;e to repre&s;ent them, and in whom they have re|po&s;ed their tru&s;t and confidence, to manage the great and important concerns of government. Now the&s;e have been very unanimous in their determination, to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try; and hence we may fairly infer, that &s;ince the Repre&s;enta|tives cho&s;en by the people, by fair election, without any bribery or undue influence, to con&s;ult and act for them in A&s;&s;emblies and Congre&s;&s;es, have agreed to make oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ures the parliament have adopted, that the union is complete, notwith&s;tanding that there are a few male-contents &s;cattered up and down in the &s;everal Colonies.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this full agreement of the public repre|&s;entative bodies, we have their opinion, as it were, in their private capacity, agreeing in the &s;ame thing. Almo&s;t every town on the continent have voluntarily and publicly acceded to this Union, by their expre&s;s votes. The &s;everal Colonies agreed according to the Re&s;olves of the Congre&s;s, to rai&s;e their quota of &s;oldi|ers when required, to take the field for the common defence. What &s;hall I &s;ay, the greater part of the <HI>Indian tribes</HI> have joined the common cau&s;e, notwith|&s;tanding all the artifices and indu&s;try of the enemy.&mdash;And even many of the <HI>Canadians,</HI> who, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the country, were trained up in hatred and enmity to us, and were our enemies, have openly joined us, and taken up arms in our cau&s;e, and have fought with the greate&s;t bravery again&s;t the mini&s;te|rial forces.</P>
<P N="2">II. And we have great rea&s;on to think, that this is a ju&s;t and righteous, as well as a general union. This &s;ubject is &s;o large, that I cannot pretend to
<PB N="9" REF="015070_0009_0F95A830E3669388">
give you a full view of it, but mu&s;t content my&s;elf with &s;ugge&s;ting only a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. It does not appear with any &s;atisfactory evidence, that there is any real need of the&s;e taxes, the incomes of Britain being more than &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of government, and the defence of the nation, if they were properly applied. Now the &s;ubject &s;hould never be further burthened with taxes than is need|ful, becau&s;e rulers are de&s;igned for the happine&s;s of their people, and not to impoveri&s;h and oppre&s;s them. It is a mo&s;t ab&s;urd notion, that &s;ubjects are made merely for the plea&s;ure and grandeur of their rulers. But it is a great truth, that rulers ought to be <Q>the mini&s;ters of God <HI>to their &s;ubjects,</HI> for their good</Q> and happine&s;s. Needle&s;s taxes are not for the good, but the mi&s;ery, of the &s;ubject, tending to reduce them to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s; and may there|fore be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as wanton undi&s;gui&s;ed oppre&s;&s;ion, to &s;upport the pride, ambition, and ex|travagance of a few grandees. Why &s;hould the in|du&s;trious farmer and his family &s;uffer by heavy taxes, which are not needful for the real expence and exi|gences of government? Why &s;hould the hone&s;t la|bourer, who earns his bread by the &s;weat of his brow, have the incomes of his labour taken away, for no|thing? Why &s;hould the indu&s;trious poor, be &s;queezed, to &s;upport the corruption and luxury of the great, who know no bounds to their pride and grandeur?&mdash;Now, we are well a&s;&s;ured, that there is no occa&s;ion of the&s;e new impo&s;itions, unle&s;s to &s;upport <HI>placemen,</HI> and <HI>pen&s;ioners,</HI> and to increa&s;e <HI>bribery, profligacy</HI> and <HI>di&s;&s;ipation;</HI> that the Briti&s;h government u&s;ed to be &s;upported with dignity in former times, particularly in Queen Elizabeth's reign, at a far le&s;s expence. There is much more expended by the pre&s;ent court, than was even in the extravagant reign of Charles II. Were there any nece&s;&s;ity for contributing to the real &s;upport and dignity of the crown, the Colonies
<PB N="10" REF="015070_0010_0F95A8319683CB40">
would cheerfully do their part. They were never backward, but rai&s;ed both men and money, when de&s;ired, beyond what we were well able; &s;o that <HI>Great-Britain</HI> repaid us large &s;ums to reimbur&s;e us in &s;ome mea&s;ure for our liberal a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their di&s;tre&s;s. Thus they acknowledged them&s;elves indebted to us, when wi&s;e and good councils prevailed&mdash;But &s;hall we contribute to &s;upport corruption, bribery, and profli|gacy, to their and our de&s;truction!</P>
<P N="2">2. The Colonies had no new claims in view. They were well affected to the <HI>Hanover-Family.</HI> His Maje&s;ty had not a body of more loyal and dutiful &s;ubjects in all his dominions than in the&s;e Colonies. We gloried in our connection with Great-Britain, and hoped, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that it might remain undi&s;turbed for many generations yet to come. There was no man, that had any thoughts of &s;etting up for inde|pendence. We were &s;o far from this, that if Great-Britain had offered to detach us from her empire, and allowed us to be an independent &s;tate, we &s;hould not have accepted it without the greate&s;t reluctance. The known enemies of the country, by their fal&s;e re|pre&s;entations; and the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try, who were credulous enough to believe them without any evi|dence; appear to have been the fir&s;t, who thought of the independence of the Colonies. And they &s;eem to have done every thing in their power, to provoke to it, by their groundle&s;s fears of it, and their unju&s;tly charging us with it; their ob&s;tinate per&s;everence in the fal&s;e accu&s;ation&mdash;contrary to the cleare&s;t evidence, and the oppre&s;&s;ive and cruel mea&s;ures they have pro|&s;ecuted under pretence of preventing it. If this event &s;hould take place, to the di&s;membering and weakening the Briti&s;h empire, it ought in truth and ju&s;tice to be a&s;cribed to the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The Colonies had no &s;uch thing in view. They only meant to defend tho&s;e rights and liberties, which they peaceably enjoyed, and that according to the
<PB N="11" REF="015070_0011_0F95A833CF875398">
mo&s;t &s;olemn charters, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the country. If therefore the public faith of Great-Britain, pledged by &s;acred charters: If the length of time, which any thing is peaceably po&s;&s;e&s;t, can give a right to it, which is commonly looked upon to confer as good a title as any; then &s;urely we have a ju&s;t right of exemption from the&s;e new invented impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>If the Briti&s;h Parliament had any right to tax us, why did they never &s;et up the claim before?&mdash;It is an unheard of thing for any &s;tate to relinqui&s;h the tribute due to them from any people, for &s;uch a great length of time.&mdash;Would they have ever pretended they had any right, had not the prodigious extrava|gance, corruption, and bribery, that have been in|troduced, forced them to &s;eek new re&s;ources? And to give out &s;ome plau&s;ible pretence, it was invented, that we were aiming at independence, which had never once come into our heads.</P>
<P>For pro&s;ecution of the &s;ame plan, they have al&s;o amu&s;ed the people with harangues upon the great national debt. But if Great-Britain be reduced to &s;uch poverty and di&s;tre&s;s by the enormous debt &s;he has contracted, why does &s;he appoint &s;o many of|fices in the Colonies, and gentlemen to fill them, with &s;uch va&s;t &s;alaries, where they are not needed? Why is the trea&s;ure of the nation thus lavi&s;hly &s;quandered away to wor&s;e than no purpo&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;upporting government, to abu&s;e and provoke the people to break out into riots and tumults, to the &s;ubver&s;ion of good order and government?</P>
<P>When the &s;hips are paid which are employed in &s;upporting the acts that lay the&s;e taxes, and the com|mi&s;&s;ioners receive their &s;alaries, and all who are de|pendent on the&s;e impo&s;itions, receive their demands, how much will be left to le&s;&s;en the national debt? And when, and how will the millions expended by
<PB N="12" REF="015070_0012_0F95A835765CEA78">
Great-Britain, in pro&s;ecuting the war &s;he has com|menced for the &s;ake of the&s;e taxes, be recovered?</P>
<P N="3">3. We meant to unite on the known and acknow|ledged principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, which the Parliament always ob&s;erved, and to which they always conformed in former times, as appears from many examples, which might be quoted. The Par|liament has not an <HI>ab&s;olute,</HI> but a <HI>limitted</HI> &s;upremacy, according to the known principles and u&s;ages of the nation; otherwi&s;e they might vote to them&s;elves all the e&s;tates of the kingdom, and &s;ell the people, that cho&s;e them, to foreign nations for &s;laves. Now there is not any one principle of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution more fundamental and &s;acred, than this; that no man &s;hall be taxed but by his own con&s;ent, by him|&s;elf, or his repre&s;entatives in Parliament. And hence no money can be granted to the crown without the con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e of Commons. They ju&s;tly keep the power of the pur&s;e, that when they labour under any grievances, they may &s;top the Money-Bill, until they obtain redre&s;s from the Crown. They &s;ay, they <HI>give,</HI> and <HI>grant,</HI> which nece&s;&s;arily refers to what is their own, and tho&s;e they repre&s;ent; but cannot refer to any thing, which belongs to tho&s;e who don't &s;tand in this connection. It would be an ab&s;urd piece of liberality in any man, or body of men, to give away what is not their own, which can never be re|conciled to common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Now we never cho&s;e the Briti&s;h Parliament to re|pre&s;ent us, and therefore they can have no manner of right to give away our money to the crown. And from the immen&s;e di&s;tance of our &s;ituation, all <HI>repre|&s;entation in Parliament is utterly impracticable,</HI> and could never an&s;wer any end, but to put us to va&s;t ex|pence, and &s;ub&s;erve the de&s;igns of the Mini&s;try. But we are repre&s;ented by our own A&s;&s;embles, and Con|gre&s;&s;es, and therefore to the&s;e alone it belongs to tax us. They know our circum&s;tances, and pay their
<PB N="13" REF="015070_0013_0F95A8372652E1F0">
&s;hare in the public taxes, &s;o that we may confide &s;afely in them.</P>
<P N="4">4. This is not merely the opinion of the <HI>Americans,</HI> but al&s;o of many the greate&s;t and be&s;t members of the Briti&s;h Parliament, who have publickly a&s;&s;erted it, and &s;upported their opinion by many unan&s;wera|ble arguments; both from rea&s;on, the principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and the known practice upon it. Perhaps we might be a little diffident of our own judgment, as we are &s;o deeply intere&s;ted in the cau&s;e: But when gentlemen of the fir&s;t character, for their under&s;tanding, acquaintance with the fun|damental laws and u&s;ages of the land, and long expe|rience in public affairs, a&s;&s;ert our cau&s;e to be ju&s;t, and &s;upport their opinion with &s;uch powerful argu|ments, as are &s;ufficient to convince all, but placemen and pen&s;ioners; this leaves no room at all to doubt, but we have ju&s;tice and the Briti&s;h con&s;titution on our &s;ide, and are contending for the true liberties, to which we are entitled as freemen, and good &s;ubjects, according to the laws of our native land. If this be not &s;o, we mu&s;t de&s;pair of under&s;tanding the princi|ples of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and may renounce all preten&s;ions to common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="5">5. To corroborate this, let it be further ob&s;erved, that we have cho&s;en men to repre&s;ent us in general A&s;&s;emblies and Congre&s;&s;es, who before the&s;e trou|bles aro&s;e, were looked upon as wi&s;e and under&s;tand|ing in all affairs, and as hone&s;t and upright, as any in the land; and, as has been already ob&s;erved, they have met and con&s;idered this grand affair at their lei|&s;ure, when they had all nece&s;&s;ary books at hand to con&s;ult, and all the papers before them that could throw any light upon the &s;ubject; and they, after the mature&s;t deliberations, are unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that the mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h parliament are uncon|&s;titutional, unju&s;t, and oppre&s;&s;ive. Now certainly we ought to pay great deference to the&s;e <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>wor|thy
<PB N="14" REF="015070_0014_0F95A837874A0720">
gentlemen</HI> in this matter, &s;ince they are much bet|ter qualified to enquire and judge concerning it, are equally di&s;intere&s;ted with our&s;elves, are more expo|&s;ed to the re&s;entment of parliament, than the bulk of the people, and under incomparably greater advanta|ges than we in general can pretend, to form a right judgment in the ca&s;e. And if we cannot tru&s;t to their under&s;tanding and integrity, to form a judgment, when we cho&s;e them our&s;elves, whom can we tru&s;t?&mdash;It would be very ab&s;urd for us to condemn them, when we have been far from having their advantages to look into the matter. For how can tho&s;e form a right judgment, who never had the ca&s;e fully laid before them, who have not a &s;ufficient &s;hare of learning and reading, to form an opinion on the con&s;titution, the proceedings of parliament, and the liberties and privileges of the Colonies?</P>
<P>If any &s;hould object, that there is equal rea&s;on to confide in the Briti&s;h parliament, it were ea&s;y to an|&s;wer, that when they vote the money of the Colonies to them&s;elves, they are judges in their own ca&s;e, which prevents their being impartial judges in our ca&s;e; be|cau&s;e &s;elf-intere&s;t perverts the under&s;tanding, and gives a wrong bias to the mind, and therefore is ne|ver allowed in any impartial court. And then, as has been ob&s;erved, there are great numbers, of the fir&s;t reputation for under&s;tanding, who are members of parliament, who have declared the&s;e mea&s;ures to be uncon&s;titutional, unju&s;t, cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive, and have warmly oppo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>And it is well known, that there are many methods u&s;ed to corrupt and bias the parliament. Where <HI>places,</HI> and <HI>pen&s;ions</HI> and <HI>bribery,</HI> are &s;o greatly in fa&s;hion, there is no room for any confidence in the equity of their acts and deci&s;ions; whereas our Congre&s;s are free from all &s;uch methods of managing bu&s;ine&s;s. It cannot be pretended, even by impudence it&s;elf, that the mem|bers of our Congre&s;s have been under any undue bias,
<PB N="15" REF="015070_0015_0F95A83841A75700">
and therefore the greate&s;t regard is to be paid to their Re&s;olves, as proceeding from uncorrupted integrity.</P>
<P N="3">III. That this union is of the greate&s;t importance in this unhappy controver&s;y will appear, if we can|didly con&s;ider the following things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Briti&s;h Parliament have &s;et up the extra|vagant claim, <HI>to make laws to bind us in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever;</HI> and to <HI>give</HI> and <HI>grant</HI> our money by taxes, at their plea&s;ure without our con&s;ent; contrary to all rea&s;on, the known principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;tituti|on, and the con&s;tant practice upon them from time immemorial; which is ju&s;tly looked upon as the great|e&s;t grievance, as depriving us of the mo&s;t valuable part of our civil liberty, and as laying a foundation to increa&s;e and &s;upport the enormous corruption which threatens the ruin of the nation. Many are the duti|ful petitions which have been pre&s;ented, to have this grievance removed, but they have been wholly di&s;re|garded. Pre&s;uming on their own power, and on our weakne&s;s to re&s;i&s;t, from the divi&s;ions, which they ima|gined mu&s;t ari&s;e among us, they have &s;teadily pro&s;e|cuted their plan of oppre&s;&s;ion, even at la&s;t by force and arms. Now Great-Britain is a great and powerful nation both by &s;ea and land. What oppo&s;ition could one Colony have made to this mighty kingdom, e&s;peci|ally if a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the re&s;t of her Colonies? It would be very di&s;couraging, if only one half of the Colonies &s;hould de&s;ert the common cau&s;e, join the Mother country, and turn their arms again&s;t their bre|thren, who &s;hould &s;tand firm in oppo&s;ition to parlia|mentary mea&s;ures. Such Colonies would certainly be in very eminent danger of being overpowered, by their neighbouring provinces, furni&s;hed with arms from Great-Britain. The hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in our oppo&s;ition to the&s;e uncon&s;titutional and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, you &s;ee greatly depend on our union.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="015070_0016_0F95A83A008C6D38">
Our numbers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>It is computed that in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, the Colonies can bring half a million of fighting men into the field.</HI></NOTE> are great, and our inhabitants in general, are not enervated with luxury and debauchery, but inured to hard&s;hip. Many &s;erved in the late war, and we have experienced Generals and Commanders. Our troops have fought as bravely as any in the world. They have all the &s;pirit and re&s;olution of freemen, and the di&s;tance from the Mother country is &s;o great, that they cannot without a prodigious expence, tran&s;port their troops to carry on the war. There is no rea&s;on in the world, why any nation &s;hould tyrannize over and oppre&s;s another. And the hi&s;tory of mankind, does not afford any in&s;tance, wherein any kingdom or empire could keep &s;uch di&s;tant provinces, inhabited by &s;uch va&s;t numbers of men of &s;pirit, in &s;lavery, unle&s;s they divide among them&s;elves. Divi&s;ions tend to re|duce and en&s;lave us, but let us remain united and firm; this will procure deliverance and freedom, through the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. The importance of this union and firmne&s;s, in|crea&s;es every day. For we have made oppo&s;ition. The &s;word has been drawn, battles have been fought, and &s;undry fortre&s;&s;es have been reduced, by the forces rai&s;ed by the common con&s;ent of the Colonies. Well, think now, what the con&s;equences would probably be, if we &s;hould be overcome. Why, we &s;hould doubtle&s;s be obliged to pay all the expences, that the crown is put to in &s;ubduing us; which would take the greate&s;t part of our e&s;tates, were we to &s;ubmit, even now. But be&s;ides this, we have rea&s;on to fear, that all our lands would be declared forfeit to the crown, according to the common &s;entence again&s;t Rebels, as they are plea&s;ed to call us.&mdash;And thus, there is no hope at all of any thing, in our being &s;ub|dued, but abject beggary. And &s;ince all the proba|bility of any &s;ucce&s;s, depends upon our union, and firmne&s;s; it mu&s;t be of the greate&s;t importance for us
<PB N="17" REF="015070_0017_0F95A83A8350EC38">
to lay a&s;ide all divi&s;ions, and be united among our|&s;elves. As &s;uch a vigorous oppo&s;ition has been made, we have certainly rea&s;on to think, that if we were now to &s;ubmit, it would be infinitely wor&s;e for us than if we had &s;ubmitted at fir&s;t; that we mu&s;t not only be taxed at plea&s;ure, as the Parliament propo&s;ed, but al&s;o make good, the great damages the nation have been put to in this controver&s;y. Whereas by union, proper re&s;olution, and good conduct, through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, we may convince the Briti&s;h Mini|&s;try of their mi&s;take, and di&s;po&s;e them to re&s;tore peace, and allow us not only to enjoy our e&s;tates, but al&s;o the rights and privileges, for which we have been contending. Their own intere&s;t will probably, at length open their eyes.</P>
<P N="3">3. A very &s;mall &s;hare of attention to the &s;tate of our country, and the unmanly artifices and indu&s;try, which our adver&s;aries have u&s;ed to &s;tir up the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> and <HI>Canadians,</HI> to invade our frontiers, mu&s;t &s;hew us, that we have already received very important ad|vantages from this union of the Colonies, and the endeavours of the Congre&s;s to &s;ecure the natives to our intere&s;t. For had it not been for the&s;e, our frontiers had been ravaged for many a hundred miles, and thou&s;ands of the back inhabitants would, in all probabilty, have been murdered, and &s;calped, and the women and children burned in the flames that con|&s;ummed their hou&s;es, or inhumanly butchered by that &s;avage and barbarous enemy. For the King's Gover|nors, and their agents, have u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endea|vours to prejudice the <HI>Indians</HI> again&s;t us, and urged them to fall upon our wide extended frontiers. And if they had &s;ucceeded in the&s;e cruel attempts, what a dreadful &s;cene, would this have opened! It is ea&s;ier imagined than de&s;cribed. It is &s;hocking indeed, but alas too true, that the barbarous &s;avages of the wil|derne&s;s have been earne&s;tly &s;olicited to fall upon the frontiers!&mdash;Where is the boa&s;ted humanity of the
<PB N="18" REF="015070_0018_0F95A83B734FF0C8">
Briti&s;h nation!&mdash;What will not arbitrary power at|tempt, to maintain and &s;pread its baleful influence?&mdash;Let <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> and <HI>Falmouth</HI> declare! Let the in|trigues of the agents among the &s;avages te&s;tify! Let the ba&s;e &s;eizure of BOSTON, and the confinement of thou&s;ands of the inhabitants to mi&s;ery and want, con|trary to the public faith, &s;olemnly pledged, bear wit|ne&s;s to all generations!</P>
<P N="4">4. This union will appear important in another view, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> on &s;uppo&s;ition that we &s;hould not think it be&s;t to continue the war, but upon the whole judge it prudent to &s;ubmit; yet &s;till we would &s;ubmit on the be&s;t terms we could.&mdash;Thus CANADA, in the la&s;t war, when they thought prudent to &s;ubmit, yet obtained very favourable terms. For our Generals knew, that it would be attended with immen&s;e co&s;t of trea&s;ure and blood, to make an entire conque&s;t, even though they had gotten po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their principal fortre&s;&s;es, as the inhabitants of the country would be con&s;tantly hara&s;&s;ing them, cutting off their convoys, and beating up their quarters. They were united, and they obtained &s;uch good terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that they &s;uffered but little by the conque&s;t, Whereas, if they had been divided, and &s;ubmitted without any terms, they would have been in very deplorable cir|cum&s;tances. And thus, if we remain firm and united, there is no rea&s;onable doubt, but we may in proper time have tolerable terms. For cannot we hara&s;s them more than <HI>Canada</HI> could? But if we divide and break to pieces among our&s;elves, we need expect no terms at all, but to be &s;tripped of all, and made &s;laves to the conquerors, as has been already ob&s;erved. Let &s;uch as think it would be be&s;t to &s;ubmit, remem|ber, that no terms have been offered to us, &s;ince the commencement of ho&s;tilities, only re&s;igning up our arms, and giving &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for the tame &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion of the inhabitants, (as <HI>Mowat</HI> offered to <HI>Fal|mouth)</HI> which certainly no man in his &s;en&s;es would be
<PB N="19" REF="015070_0019_0F95A83C62E2CD28">
willing to accept. Who would be &s;o mean &s;pirited, as to re&s;ign his arms, till he was conquered? Would &s;uch, as are mo&s;t zealous for the crown, be willing to be given up as ho&s;tages, and to be put to death in ca&s;e the Colonies refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the &s;chemes of the Mini&s;try? No. They would immediately &s;hrink at the propo&s;al. So that there is no way at pre&s;ent to accommodate the breach, as no terms have been of|fered. Union then mu&s;t be of great importance, until they are offered, unle&s;s that people would propo&s;e to bring utter ruin on this flouri&s;hing country, and in|deed upon them&s;elves and their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>As we live in the &s;ame country, in the &s;ame go|vernments, and have a thou&s;and connections, we &s;hould in all prudence determine to &s;tand or fall together. We &s;hall doubtle&s;s be con&s;idered in the &s;ame predica|ment; and the &s;entence, which will be i&s;&s;ued again&s;t us in this ca&s;e, will be general, again&s;t whole Colo|nies, and will not make exceptions for this, that, and the other per&s;on. For if the preten&s;ions of parti|cular per&s;ons in &s;uch a ca&s;e were to be regarded, there would be no end, every one could have &s;ome plea or other to make for them&s;elves. But, as has been ob|&s;erved, in all &s;uch ca&s;es, the &s;entence again&s;t the peo|ple in any Colony, mu&s;t proceed upon the public con|duct of their A&s;&s;emblies, the part they took in the conte&s;t. Now, as it is well known, that our General A&s;&s;embly have e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the country, in oppo&s;ition to the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try, it is too late for our inhabitants to think of availing them&s;elves by their private jangling and clamours, when the evidence of the part we have taken is &s;o clear and undeniable. Since all the Colonies have &s;olemnly confederated to|gether, it would be mean indeed to de&s;ert the com|mom cau&s;e, incon&s;i&s;tent with the public faith already pledged; and would therefore draw upon &s;uch perfi|dious wretches, the vengeance of the re&s;t, not to mention the cur&s;e of God, for their breach of cove|nant.
<PB N="20" REF="015070_0020_0F95A83FF8DEA7A0">
So that if only a part here, and a part there&punc; &s;hould &s;ubmit, it would kindle civil war among our|&s;elves, which would be more dreadful than with Great-Britain, as by living among one another, the inha|bitants would have an opportunity, every man to kill his neighbour, and turn the country into a field of blood and de&s;olation; whereas, by a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion upon terms, wherein all are included, the&s;e dreadful cala|mities might be prevented; and when the wor&s;t comes to the wor&s;t, we might at la&s;t obtain good conditions of peace.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We are now in the la&s;t place more particu|larly to point out &s;ome of the bad con&s;equences of breaking this general union.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, that every one will readily under&s;tand, that tho&s;e break it, who don't comply with it, and carefully ob&s;erve it. This may be done by words or actions, and more gro&s;sly in &s;ome in&s;tances than in others; &s;ome may break it through ignorance, others with premeditated de&s;ign and ob&s;tinacy; &s;o that there may be a very great difference among &s;uch, and very different degrees of guilt contracted. This being premi&s;ed; I would ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That this non-compliance occa&s;ions, as is ob|&s;erved in my text, of the divi&s;ions of Reuben, great thoughts and &s;earchings of heart. Such are ready to pretend to be good friends to their country: But why then do they refu&s;e to join with their brethren?&mdash;Let their views and intentions be what they will, they expo&s;e them&s;elves to great &s;u&s;picions and reproaches, and employ &s;ome part of that attention how to pre|vent their doing mi&s;chief, which &s;hould be devoted to plan and provide for the common &s;afety. And, as all men have their particular friends and connections, this divi&s;ion occa&s;ions much alienation of heart and affecti|ons among brethren, and various di&s;turbances in the country; all which are very uncomfortable, and mar the public peace, and which might be happily pre|vented,
<PB N="21" REF="015070_0021_0F95A841CB1470E8">
by all heartily uniting with the va&s;tly great majority of the country.</P>
<P>And the&s;e things are al&s;o attended with much &s;in and wickedne&s;s. Can per&s;ons maintain an unfriendly temper to their country, and neighbours, and &s;eek to &s;ubject them to heavy taxes and &s;lavery; and be inno|cent?&mdash;Can they mi&s;repre&s;ent the country, and &s;olicit for troops to dragoon us into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the&s;e un|con&s;titutional acts of Parliament, without contracting guilt of the blacke&s;t die?&mdash;They often complain of the hard treatment they have met with. It is likely they have been hardly u&s;ed in &s;ome in&s;tances; but they &s;hould make &s;ome allowance for the zeal, which is common at &s;uch times, when people are vio|lently &s;truggling for their LIBERTIES, and THEIR ALL. They would al&s;o do well to con&s;ider, whether they are not the blameable cau&s;e, by giving ju&s;t provo|cation for the treatment, of which they complain.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould plead con&s;cience for their conduct, it might be queried, whether they have ever taken &s;uf|ficient pains to inform them&s;elves? or examined the matter with due candour?&mdash;Where is the divine law, that binds their con&s;cience to make divi&s;ions to &s;upport oppre&s;&s;ion, and ruin their country?&mdash;The wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men in the Parliament, and among our&s;elves, who have been cho&s;en on purpo&s;e to con&s;ider this mat|ter, and who have had lei&s;ure, and all po&s;&s;ible advan|tages, are unanimous for oppo&s;ition. Now, &s;uch as have never had opportunity to examine fully, nor take pains to inform them&s;elves, might, con&s;i&s;tent with mode&s;ty and prudence, very ju&s;tly &s;cruple their own judgment. It &s;eems to favour more of &s;elf-con|ceit, impudence, and ob&s;tinacy, than of con&s;cience, to act contrary to the united wi&s;dom of the whole Con|tinent.</P>
<P>Any unprejudiced per&s;on would rather think, from the many exhortations, we have in the &s;criptures, to peace and unanimity, that their con&s;cience &s;hould
<PB N="22" REF="015070_0022_0F95A8460FE61950">
dictate to them, to be of one mind with their brethren; and &s;tudy the things that make for peace, <Q>and the things whereby we may edify one another,</Q> and &s;upport the common cau&s;e of our country.</P>
<P N="2">2. This mu&s;t receive &s;ome weight from the con&s;i|deration, that &s;uch as appear in oppo&s;ition to the ge|neral union, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be of any &s;ervice or ad|vantage to the mini&s;terial cau&s;e, &s;ince the power and arms of the country are all in a manner again&s;t them. Such as have &s;hewed ho&s;tile intentions, or have ri&s;en in arms have been &s;o few, and their councils &s;o di&s;tracted, that they have been di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;armed almo&s;t as &s;oon as they have been di&s;covered; &s;o that they have not been able to make the lea&s;t diver&s;ion in favour of the mini&s;terial army, or contribute any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. All they have done is, to di&s;turb the public peace a little, to bring la&s;ting reproach and di&s;grace upon them|&s;elves, and perplexity, with di&s;tre&s;s of mind, upon their families; all which they might have avoid|ed, by joining with their brethren. And why &s;hould any man, without good rea&s;on, bring immedi|ate trouble on him&s;elf and family? Does not this look like a very &s;illy piece of conduct? If they have no love nor regard for their country, why &s;hould they have none for their wives and children?</P>
<P>The damage they do the common cau&s;e by &s;uch conduct, is the holding it up to the public view of the nation at home, that there is a divi&s;ion among us. For when it is repre&s;ented, that <HI>Ridgefield</HI> and <HI>Newtown,</HI> and a few more &s;uch places, are in oppo&s;ition, we, who live here, know, that the&s;e towns are &s;mall, and the oppo&s;ition &s;o contemptible, as &s;carcely to be worth the public notice; but the nation at home, the greater part of them, don't know, but the&s;e are &s;ome great and populous cities, like <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Liverpool,</HI> and thus it carries in it the nature of fal&s;e intelligence, and de|ceives the parliament, and thus hardens them to pro&s;e|cute their pernicious mea&s;ures, to their own di&s;honour
<PB N="23" REF="015070_0023_0F95A847C538A798">
and de&s;truction. If the Mini&s;try had obtained a true account of the &s;tate of the country, before they had proceeded &s;o far, they would never have attempted the&s;e things. But the enemies of the country made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to mi&s;repre&s;ent the &s;tate of the coun|try, and thus impo&s;e upon and deceive the mini&s;try; &s;o that they have been, in this re&s;pect, the wicked in&s;truments of all the calamities that have come, the ruin of all the towns that have been burned, and of all the lives that have been lo&s;t in this unnatural war.&mdash;When enquiry &s;hall be made for blood, they will doubtle&s;s be found to be deeply &s;tained with the blood of the many innocents, that have been already &s;lain, or that may yet be &s;lain in the pro&s;ecution of this un|happy conte&s;t.</P>
<P>Should they therefore obtain the heighth of their wi&s;hes, even that the country &s;hould be &s;ubdued by the mini&s;terial forces, this would make them but &s;mall compen&s;ation for the guilt, they have contracted; and the puni&s;hment that is hanging over them, for the great deceit they have u&s;ed with the mini&s;try, and the many mi&s;repre&s;entations they have made, and lies they have told, and indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated and &s;pread, to carry on their &s;chemes, and accompli&s;h the ruin of this land.</P>
<P>As to their being di&s;tingui&s;hed and rewarded by the crown, after the de&s;truction and conque&s;t of the&s;e co|lonies, they may con&s;ider, that it is far from being cer|tain this event will take place. For it is po&s;&s;ible, that the unhappy breach may yet be healed. The great God governs the world. He can re&s;train the pride and the wrath of man, He can ea&s;ily di&s;ap|point the &s;chemes and de&s;igns of deceitful and cruel men, as he did wicked <HI>Haman's,</HI> and re&s;tore peace to his people. He has &s;aid that <Q>he will &s;peak peace un|to his people, and to his &s;aints; but let them not re|turn again to folly. The rod of the wicked &s;hall not re&s;t upon the lot of the righteous; le&s;t the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</Q></P>

But if the things of the nation's peace, &s;hould in judgment be hid from the eyes of the rulers, for the correction of their &s;ins, and ours; and the mini&s;try &s;hould pro&s;ecute the war with the greate&s;t vigour; yet it is far from being certain, that they would be able to &s;ubdue us.

And &s;ince the <HI>Americans</HI> are all freemen, and fight for their <HI>Liberty,</HI> and <HI>their all,</HI> and are known to be endowed with the greate&s;t bravery, it is not to be doubted but they will fight with greater courage and re&s;olu|tion, than the mercenary troops of the mini&s;try, who contrary to their inclinations, or through gro&s;s igno|rance, fight to enforce &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch as have their minds fearfully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the power of Britain, her formidable fleet, and gallant armies, remember, that <Q>the race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong.</Q> The God of armies gives the victory to whom it plea&s;es him. And &s;urely the righteous and merciful God, does not approve of oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny; and therefore we have no rea&s;on to think, that he will &s;ucceed the de&s;igns of the mini&s;try, any further than is nece&s;&s;ary for our correction, to bring us to repen|tance for our many &s;ins and back&s;lidings. Now on either of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that reconciliation &s;hould yet take place, between us and the mother-country; or that Great-Britain &s;hould not be able finally to &s;ubdue this land, but we &s;hould, like the <HI>Dutch Provinces,</HI> maintain our liberties and privileges; What mu&s;t become of the known enemies of the country,
<PB N="25" REF="015070_0025_0F95A84B4C4F9898">
that &s;eek to break our union, to divide and de&s;troy us?</P>
<P>But if the country &s;hould be de&s;troyed by the mi|ni&s;terial army, which is all &s;uch enemies can wi&s;h for, what benefit would this be to them? A ruined coun|try can afford but &s;mall revenues, to the mo&s;t &s;evere publican, and mercile&s;s commi&s;&s;ioner of cu&s;toms. And though there are but few &s;uch, compared with the whole body of this people, yet the&s;e are va&s;tly too many to be all taken notice of and rewarded. One or two hundred would be &s;ufficient for all the po&s;ts of honour and profit, the crown would have to be&s;tow, even then. Whereas there are more than two or three thou&s;and, who are unfriendly to the common cau&s;e in the &s;everal governments, &s;o that &s;carcely one in ten, perhaps not one in a hundred, who would ever obtain any promotion or reward; but all mu&s;t pay their quota of the heavy taxes that would be impo|&s;ed. And &s;uch offices are not entailed upon families, even tho&s;e who &s;hould obtain them, as &s;oon as they were dead, their children would be as much oppre&s;&s;ed as any. And thus, upon the whole, &s;uch as break the union of the Colonies, though in promo|ting a little divi&s;ion they do much damage by deceiv|ing the Mini&s;try, and encouraging them to pro&s;ecute their pernicious mea&s;ures, can have no rational pro&s;|pect of any advantage to them&s;elves; but if the coun|try be ruined, mu&s;t peri&s;h unnoticed in the general de|&s;truction, they have been the unhappy in&s;truments of bringing on the country.</P>
<P>For if there were a great many more offices of pro|fit and honour, in the gift of the crown, than there could be, mu&s;t not the officers and troops, that were employed in conquering the country, be provided for in the fir&s;t place?&mdash;Such of the <HI>Americans</HI> then, as merely wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to the parliament, mu&s;t wait till all the&s;e were rewarded; &s;o that upon the whole, if they promi&s;e them&s;elves any great things, from the ruin of the country, they are mo&s;t likely to be di&s;ap|pointed,
<PB N="26" REF="015070_0026_0F95A84D0445D388">
as is ju&s;t and righteous, in divine providence. What preten&s;ions can &s;uch as prove treacherous to their country, have to recommend them to any office, of honour and profit? Don't they rather forfeit all credit and tru&s;t, and ju&s;tly de&s;erve to be neglected, de|&s;pi&s;ed and abhorred by all mankind? Such then as di&s;&s;ent from the great majority of their country, and promote divi&s;ions and contentions, mu&s;t do it thro' igno|rance, or ob&s;tinacy, or hopes of private advantage to them|&s;elves, the mo&s;t mean and &s;ordid of all views; which hopes they may re&s;t fully a&s;&s;ured, will be di&s;appointed. And thus they will find in the end, that they will reap no advantage from their conduct; only the reflection that they have endeavoured to do mi&s;chief, and ruin their country, and them&s;elves, for the &s;ake of mi&s;chief, and the groundle&s;s hatred they bore to their native land, will remain to con&s;ole them.</P>
<P>How much wi&s;er are they to dive&s;t them&s;elves of all their groundle&s;s prejudices again&s;t their country, and heartily join with their brethern, that no head may be wanting in the hour of con&s;ultation, nor hand ab|&s;ent in the hour of action. When &s;uch a numerous and brave people are united as one man, in the righteous cau&s;e of their much oppre&s;&s;ed and injured country; What can be imagined too difficult for them to attempt and accompli&s;h? What can re&s;i&s;t their united ardour, or &s;top the torrent of their &s;ucce&s;&s;es?&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. And now &s;ince we have rai&s;ed forces, and our friends, our neighbours, our brothers and children, are gone forth, and are expo&s;ing their lives in the high places of the field for our defence, and we all mu&s;t contribute our &s;hare in the common expence for their &s;upport; &s;urely it mu&s;t be ab&s;urd with a wit|ne&s;s, for us, who live at our ea&s;e at home, to weaken their hands, and di&s;courage their hearts, and &s;pirit up the enemy again&s;t them, by our divi&s;ions and quarrels. For the&s;e divi&s;ions have this tendency, They may well rea&s;on with them&s;elves, "why &s;hould we expo&s;e our|&s;elves
<PB N="27" REF="015070_0027_0F95A84D472890B8">
to hunger and cold, and all the malice and fury of the enemy, when our friends and brethren at home are joining again&s;t us?" Do per&s;ons really de&s;ire to prolong the war, that they may &s;upport it at a va&s;t expence, that their children, and brothers, and friends and neighbours, &s;hould be overthrown by the enemy, lie unburied in the field, or to peri&s;h in a loath&s;ome pri&s;on? Do they de&s;ire that the enemy &s;hould lay wa&s;te our country by fire and &s;word, ravi&s;h our wives and daughters, and butcher our children? If they do not, let them not encourage the Mini&s;try by divi&s;ions, but maintain the general union to the utmo&s;t of their power. Otherwi&s;e, if the&s;e inte&s;tine divi&s;ions &s;hould prove the means of di&s;couraging our armies, and of hardening and &s;piriting up our foes; and this land &s;hould be ruined and en&s;laved, po&s;terity to all gene|rations will cur&s;e the promoters of the&s;e divi&s;ions, and the names and memory of the wretches, will be held in everla&s;ting abhorrence, as the ba&s;e betrayers of their once happy country.&mdash;If per&s;ons don't think of &s;uch dreadful con&s;quences, it is &s;urely high time they did.</P>
<P>To conclude this di&s;cour&s;e, let us be thankful to the Lord, who, in the cour&s;e of his providence, has cau&s;ed &s;uch a <HI>general union</HI> and <HI>harmony</HI> to prevail throughout the Colonies. This unexpected union in the common danger and di&s;tre&s;s, for our common de|fence, is &s;urely to be a&s;cribed to the Lord, in who&s;e hands are the hearts of the children of men; who has e&s;tabli&s;hed his throne in the Heavens, and who&s;e king|dom rules over all. And while we are thankful for this union, and for the various &s;ucce&s;&s;es with which the Lord of ho&s;ts has crowned our arms; let us carefully avoid every thing that tends to break this happy uni|on, upon which the &s;afety of the country evidently depends. Let us avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible, all malice and bitterne&s;s; and while we unite as brethren, let us al&s;o love as brethren, and as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;tudy the things that make for peace and harmony; that if
<PB N="28" REF="015070_0028_0F95A850A01C8CF0">
it be po&s;&s;ible, we may pre&s;erve peace among our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the&s;e troubles and calamities, are puni&s;h|ments for our &s;ins, and back&s;lidings, let us all be earne&s;tly called upon, to hear the voice of God's rod, as well as of his word, "and repent and turn from all our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, that &s;o iniquiry may not prove our ru|in." This will be the be&s;t means to promote our uni|on, and to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, by engaging the Lord to be on our &s;ide. This will be the be&s;t evidence of our complying with the great de&s;ign of this day of public thank&s;giving, &s;ince the goodne&s;s of God, with which &s;incere gratitude complies, leads &s;inners to repentance: To which may God Almighty di&s;po&s;e us, by the influ|ences of his &s;pirit, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, AMEN.</P>
