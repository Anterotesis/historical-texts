<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2d CHRONICLES vi.40, 41.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Now, my God, let, I be&s;eech thee, thine Eyes be open, and let thine Ears be attent unto the Prayer that is made in this Place.</P>
<P>Now therefore ari&s;e, O Lord God, into thy re&s;ting Place, thou, and the Ark of thy Strength: Let thy Prie&s;ts, O Lord God, be cloathed with Salvation, and let thy Saints rejoice in Goodne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS hou&s;e being built to the honour of God's holy name, with much unanimity and di&s;patch, through the favour of di|vine providence; and it being, from this time forward, to be devoted, &s;et apart and dedicated, to the more &s;olemn, public and immediate wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of the one &s;upreme Lord of the univer&s;e, was the rea&s;on of my choo&s;ing the&s;e words of the wi&s;e King Solomon (uttered on a like occa&s;ion) for your con&s;ideration at this time.&mdash;My text is a part of that &s;olemn and excellent prayer, which the wi&s;e man offered up to his maker, when he con&s;ecrated to his &s;acred &s;ervice an elegant and beautiful edifice, even that rich and magnificent Temple, which he had erect|ed to that noble purpo&s;e. And although the work|man&s;hip and ornamental glory of the hou&s;e, in which we are now a&s;&s;embled, are incomparably beneath tho&s;e of Solomon's Temple; yet the words under con&s;ideration, may be as properly u&s;ed at the dedica|tion
<PB N="2" REF="012258_0006_0F8A6BEEDBD18178">
of this Hou&s;e, as they were at the con&s;ecration of that Temple. For the pre&s;ence of God is as nece&s;&s;ary in this Sanctuary, as in that of Solomon: You <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> really need God's favourable attention to your prayers offered in this Church, as the I&s;raelites did in their Temple. And if you <HI>wor&s;hip in &s;pirit and in truth,</HI> with &s;incere devotion and hearty affection; the God of heaven will as mercifully hear, and an&s;wer with as bountiful a ble&s;&s;ing, tho&s;e prayers you offer in this Church, and as readily afford you his gracious pre|&s;ence and acceptance in this Hou&s;e, as he did the I&s;raelites in that &s;plendid Temple, which was adorn|ed with all the wealth and art of a potent empire. For, under the Chri&s;tian oeconomy, <HI>Wherever two or three are gathered together in</HI> Chri&s;t<HI>'s name, there will</HI> he <HI>be in the mid&s;t of them.</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> notwith&s;tanding <HI>heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain</HI> God; yet he will afford his pre&s;ence to the faithful, in tho&s;e Hou&s;es which are built for his honour, and devoted to his &s;acred wor&s;hip and &s;ervice. For, <HI>thus &s;aith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, who&s;e name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him al&s;o that is of a contrite and humble &s;pirit, to revive the &s;pi|rit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. Thy way, O God, is in the &s;anctuary,</HI> &s;aith the royal P&s;almi&s;t. So that, although the magnificence of this Hou&s;e will not compare with that of Solo|mon's Temple; yet if you are properly qualified for the divine favour, and in the&s;e courts offer up un|feigned, pure and holy wor&s;hip, God will in a peculiar and glorious manner be pre&s;ent with a ble&s;&s;ing. And &s;ince the occa&s;ion of our being now a&s;&s;embled together, is &s;imilar to that upon which the words of my text were fir&s;t u&s;ed; let us con&s;ider them, and
<PB N="3" REF="012258_0007_0F8A6BEFA78245E8">
attend to the peculiar in&s;truction which they are pro|per to afford.</P>
<P>Solomon entreateth the Lord God, that in ca&s;e his people, for their &s;ins, &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by their <HI>enemies</HI>&mdash;by <HI>drought</HI>&mdash;by <HI>dearth&mdash;pe&s;tilence&mdash;bla&s;ting&mdash; mildew&mdash;locu&s;ts&mdash;caterpillars</HI>&mdash;or any kind of &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;hould repent and pray to God, in or toward that hou&s;e, he would hear and except their prayer, forgive their &s;in, and deliver them out of their cala|mity. And then, the wi&s;e King, drawing towards a conclu&s;ion, de&s;ires that God would be ready to hear, and graciou&s;ly an&s;wer, all the faithful prayers, which &s;hould be offered up in that Hou&s;e upon any occa&s;ion what&s;oever: <HI>Now, my God, let, I be&s;eech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.</HI> And then he reque&s;ts of God to accept of that Hou&s;e for his Sanctuary; his re&s;ting place, where he might at all times be gra|ciou&s;ly pre&s;ent: That he would direct and ble&s;s the endeavours of the prie&s;thood for the good of the people; and grant his faithful wor&s;hippers great oc|ca&s;ion to rejoice in his mercy, favour and protection: <HI>Now therefore ari&s;e, O Lord God, into thy re&s;ting place; thou, and the ark of thy &s;trength: Let thy prie&s;ts, O Lord God, be cloathed with &s;alvation, and let thy &s;aints rejoice in goodne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This text is one remarkable in&s;tance of the reli|gious cu&s;tom among God's people, in former ages, of &s;etting apart, and dedicating Hou&s;es to the &s;olemn wor&s;hip of their maker. This cu&s;tom, among the Jews, was under the direction and approbation of God: And performed by Solomon, with the imme|diate a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the divine &s;pirit. And this has been almo&s;t the univer&s;al cu&s;tom of Chri&s;tians, ever
<PB N="4" REF="012258_0008_0F8A6BF0528E3A98">
&s;ince they have been &s;uffered to erect decent hou&s;es of wor&s;hip. Hence we may infer from the text,</P>
<P N="1">I. That God affords his more peculiar pre&s;ence in tho&s;e Hou&s;es which are devoted to his &s;acred wor&s;hip; and hath a greater regard for them than for other places.</P>
<P N="2">II. That God is treated with greater re&s;pect, ho|nour and reverence, by the public wor&s;hip of his peo|ple; and will more graciou&s;ly hear and an&s;wer their grateful prai&s;es, and &s;incere prayers, when offered up in <HI>his</HI> Sanctuary, than el&s;ewhere. And,</P>
<P N="3">III. The re&s;pect which is due from you to this Hou&s;e, con&s;idered as the Temple of God; and how you ought always to behave when you tread the courts of the Lord's Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, we learn that God affords his more pe|culiar pre&s;ence in tho&s;e Hou&s;es which are devoted to his &s;acred wor&s;hip; and hath a greater regard for them than for other places. <HI>Ari&s;e, O Lord God, in|to thy re&s;ting place, thou, and the ark of thy &s;trength.</HI></P>
<P>That allwi&s;e providence of the &s;upreme Lord of nature, which &s;urveys, and con&s;tantly pre&s;ides over the whole univer&s;e, doth neverthele&s;s fix its pecu|liar attention upon &s;ome particular places <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>South</HI> in eundem.</NOTE>. <HI>God hath loved the gates of Sion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob</HI>; &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t. Again, <HI>the Lord hath cho&s;en Zion; he hath de&s;ired it for his habitation. This is my re&s;t for ever: Here will I dwell; for I have de|&s;ired it.</HI> And accordingly, in the fir&s;t ages of the Church, to have places &s;et apart for religious wor&s;hip, was the care of divine providence. The Patriarch Jacob was admoni&s;hed from heaven to build an al|tar to the Lord, in that place where he had before appeared to him in a dream, where the Patriarch had
<PB N="5" REF="012258_0009_0F8A6BF11EE26EE0">
<HI>&s;et up a &s;tone for a pillar,</HI> and <HI>vowed,</HI> that <HI>if God would be with him,&mdash;that &s;tone &s;hould be God's hou&s;e:&mdash; This,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>is the gate of heaven.</HI>&mdash;How particular were the directions which God gave to Mo&s;es con|cerning the Tabernacle! And how exact was he about the Temple! Though David was a <HI>man after God's own heart,</HI> and had made a prodigious prepa|ration of materials, yet, becau&s;e he had &s;hed blood, though it was the blood of the open enemies of the true God, he was not &s;uffered &s;o much as to lay the foundation of that &s;acred building: But the whole glory of the work devolved upon Solomon; who&s;e heavenly wi&s;dom, &s;hining forth in a ble&s;&s;ed time of uninterrupted peace and plenty, rendered him a more plea&s;ing and unexceptionable in&s;trument for &s;o noble a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, when the Temple, for the &s;ins of the peo|ple, was levelled with the ground, by an A&s;&s;yrian army, yet, after the cha&s;ti&s;ement of a long captivity had fitted the Jews for the precious enjoyment of God's peculiar pre&s;ence among them again, how won|derfully did God influence the heart of Cyrus, though a heathen Prince, to &s;et forward the building of another Temple! And was not that &s;hining miracu|lous cloud, which was often &s;een in and over the Ta|bernacle and Temple, called, by the Jews, <HI>Shekina,</HI> or maje&s;tic divine pre&s;ence?&mdash;Was not this, I &s;ay, a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and wonderful token of God's peculiar regard for, and &s;pecial pre&s;ence in that Hou&s;e, which was devoted wholly to his &s;olemn wor&s;hip?</P>
<P>Neither the horrible &s;chi&s;m and rebellion of Corah, and his company, nor the &s;udden and awful ven|geance of heaven upon them, could de&s;ecrate or un|hallow their centers, becau&s;e they had been devoted to the &s;ervice of God. Said the Lord to Mo&s;es, <HI>the
<PB N="6" REF="012258_0010_0F8A6BF1DA40B7E8">
cen&s;ers of the&s;e &s;inners again&s;t their own &s;ouls, let them make broad plates for a covering of the altar; for they offered them before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed.</HI> And the ca&s;e is ju&s;t the &s;ame with re&s;pect to places which are con&s;ecrated to the wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>Again, that God is peculiarly pre&s;ent in, and hath a greater regard for Hou&s;es and other things which are devoted to his &s;ervice, than for tho&s;e which are not, appears by the exemplary vengeance of God, executed upon the profaners and impious violators of them.</P>
<P>Sacrilegious depredations have ever been attended by the &s;ecret cur&s;e of God, and the invi&s;ible ven|geance of heaven <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>South</HI> in eundem.</NOTE>. This kind of wickedne&s;s hath con|&s;umed the families of Princes, demoli&s;hed thrones, and laid whole kingdoms wa&s;te. When the Phili|&s;tines routed the armies of I&s;rael, and took from them the ark of God, what a dreadful cur&s;e was it to them, like a devouring plague in their very bow|els!&mdash;The vengeance of heaven &s;truck Uzzah dead in a moment, for touching the ark; becau&s;e, though he was zealous for its pre&s;ervation, yet he had no right to meddle with it. When God delivered the law to Mo&s;es at Sinai, any bea&s;t that touched the mountain, was to be &s;truck through with a dart; and to fall a &s;acrifice for a crime, which it was ut|terly uncon&s;cious of. We read that in the reign of Rehoboam, King of Judah, Shi&s;hak, King of Egypt, came up to Jeru&s;alem, and took away the trea&s;ures of Solomon's Temple, even tho&s;e uten&s;ils which had been devoted to &s;acred u&s;e: And we are told by Jo|&s;ephus what happened to <HI>him,</HI> after this &s;acrilegious robbery.&mdash;When he returned to Egypt, great mi&s;|chiefs befel his family; he burnt to death two of his
<PB N="7" REF="012258_0011_0F8A6BF2EBB214B8">
children; his brother con&s;pired again&s;t him; and his &s;on, who next po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne, was &s;truck blind. Afterwards the great Nebuchadnezzar robbed God's Temple: And we al&s;o read what judgments followed his &s;acrilege.&mdash;For being puffed up with his own greatne&s;s, and what he had done, we are told that his kingdom was taken from him; and he him&s;elf, by a judgment before unheard of, driven from hu|man &s;ociety, and made to feed on gra&s;s with the bea&s;ts of the field; his impiety rendering him more proper to a&s;&s;ociate with brutes, than with tho&s;e who were capable of religion.&mdash;And when his &s;on Bel&s;haz|zar became King, at an impious fea&s;t, he &s;ent for the &s;acred ve&s;&s;els, which had been taken from God's Temple in Jeru&s;alem, and made u&s;e of them to drink out of, in deri&s;ion of their being devoted to the reli|gious &s;ervice of the God of I&s;rael: And while he was profaning and polluting them with his &s;en&s;uality, he &s;aw part of an hand upon the wall of his apart|ment in the palace, and the fingers writing his doom there in legible characters, <HI>viz. God hath numbered thy kingdom, and fini&s;hed it.&mdash;Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.&mdash;Thy kingdom is di|vided, and given to the Medes and Per&s;ians.</HI> And the prophet Daniel, immediately before he interpreted the &s;entence, told him what this judgment was for: He declared to him, that though he knew the impi|ety of his father, yet he had <HI>not humbled his heart; but</HI> thou <HI>ha&s;t lifted up thy&s;elf,</HI> &s;aid the prophet, <HI>again&s;t the Lord of heaven, and they have brought the ve&s;&s;els of his Hou&s;e before thee, and thou and thy Lords, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them.</HI>&mdash; And we are informed that the &s;entence was &s;peedily executed upon him; for that very night, Cyrus with his army broke into the city of Babylon, and took
<PB N="8" REF="012258_0012_0F8A6BF36DF37550">
from Bel&s;hazzar both his kingdom and his life. And many other remarkable in&s;tances of the execution of divine vengeance, upon the profaners, and &s;acri|legious violators of tho&s;e things which were &s;acred to God, under the Jewi&s;h oeconomy, might be pro|duced.</P>
<P>Under the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation al&s;o, hi&s;tory abounds with accounts of the &s;ame thing.
<Q>There is nothing (&s;ays an ingenious <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. South.</NOTE> author) that the united voice of all hi&s;tory proclaims &s;o loud, as the certain unfailing cur&s;e, that hath pur&s;ued and overtook &s;acrilege.</Q>
All this &s;hows that God hath a peculiar regard for Hou&s;es, and other things, that are religiou&s;ly devoted to his wor&s;hip and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I will now ju&s;t mention &s;ome of the rea&s;ons why God affords his more peculiar pre&s;ence in tho&s;e Hou&s;es which are devoted to his &s;acred wor&s;hip, and hath a greater regard for them, than for other places.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on is, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>John&s;on</HI> in eundem.</NOTE> that God e&s;teems him&s;elf peculi|arly honoured by his people, when they pay him that re&s;pectful reverence, which the meeting toge|ther of con&s;iderable numbers in one place, and unit|ing in religious homage, doth expre&s;s. And there|fore he is plea&s;ed to be more peculiarly pre&s;ent among them at &s;uch times.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on is, that in Hou&s;es wholly devoted to the wor&s;hip of God, the minds of men, being in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;eparated from all worldly objects, and removed from their temporal concerns, are le&s;s &s;ub|ject to be diverted from devotion.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on is, that Hou&s;es devoted to God, and u&s;ed only in his &s;ervice, do naturally in&s;pire the minds of men with reverence for God and religion;
<PB N="9" REF="012258_0013_0F8A6BF58E90E1C0">
which tends to fit them for the divine pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on why God &s;o peculiarly regards his Hou&s;e, as commonly to puni&s;h the profaners and vi|olators of it with exemplary vengeance, is becau&s;e that &s;uch proceedings tend to the di&s;repute of reli|gion, and are a daring in&s;ult upon the maje&s;ty of the invi&s;ible God: For a&s;&s;aulting a man's hou&s;e, is in&s;ulting his per&s;on.</P>
<P>The la&s;t rea&s;on I &s;hall mention (and that not the lea&s;t of them) why God manife&s;ts a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> South.</NOTE> particular regard for Hou&s;es and other things which are devoted to his &s;ervice, is becau&s;e they are peculiarly his pro|perty. There is no holine&s;s in the&s;e things, con&s;ider|ed in them&s;elves, that occa&s;ions his regard for them; not even the mo&s;t holy place in Solomon's Temple had inherently any more &s;anctity than any other place; but it was relatively holy, being in a pecu|lar manner God's property. Not but that God is the ab&s;olute proprietor of all things; yet neverthele&s;s tho&s;e things, which men have no right to u&s;e, except in his immediate &s;ervice, may be peculiarly called <HI>his</HI> property; while he hath granted to them the free u&s;e of all other things which come in their way, for their temporal comfort and &s;upport.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are peculiarly the property of God, which he hath cho&s;en, and &s;et apart for his own u&s;e and &s;ervice. <HI>Of every tree of the garden thou maye&s;t freely eat,</HI> &s;aid God to Adam; <HI>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou &s;halt not eat.</HI>&mdash;Thus al&s;o God cho&s;e the <HI>gates of Sion, and the tribe of Levi.</HI></P>
<P>That is likewi&s;e the peculiar property of God, which men &s;et apart and devote to his immediate
<PB N="10" REF="012258_0014_0F8A6BF647D15F90">
&s;ervice. In this ca&s;e, men give, or more properly return, as an offering to God, that which he hath fir&s;t given to them. They relinqui&s;h, quit and deli|ver up to God, all their right or liberty to u&s;e tho&s;e things as their own property, as for any worldly pur|po&s;e, which God hath freely granted to them, for their own &s;ecular u&s;e. Upon which donation or de|dication, the property of the things given, and the u&s;e of them, are alienated and ab&s;olutely changed: So that men have no manner of right to the u&s;e of them, except in that immediate &s;ervice of God, to which they were appropriated. And God will en|dure no rival or competitor in them: But the man who profanes, invades or violates them, is guilty of a &s;acrilegious u&s;urpation; for which the vengeance of heaven is armed again&s;t him, and the cur&s;e of God will con&s;ume him. Man's giving up, and devoting to the immediate &s;ervice of God, Hou&s;es, or other things, is now, under the Chri&s;tian oeconomy, the foundation of his peculiar property in them.</P>
<P>That man who takes upon him the office of a prie&s;t in Chri&s;t's Church, doth &s;o give him&s;elf up to God and to his &s;ervice, that he hath no more right to di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf to any other employment, than he hath to command the &s;ervice of one who is &s;upe|rior to, and ab&s;olutely independent of him. And Hou&s;es given up to God, and devoted to his imme|diate &s;ervice, are peculiarly his property. And men have no more right to appropriate them to any other u&s;e, than they have to di&s;po&s;e of other mens e&s;tates: Nay, the crime is, almo&s;t beyond compari&s;on, great|er and more aggravated, becau&s;e it is &s;acrilege&mdash;an ho&s;tile robbery, perpetrated again&s;t the &s;upreme ruler of the univer&s;e, who is an infinite benefactor,

<P>And con&s;idering with what bold and undaunted confidence men are &s;ometimes apt to invade the pro|perty of an invi&s;ible, though almighty avenger, a religious and public dedication of Hou&s;es to the &s;acred wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God, as it doth im|pre&s;s a more &s;en&s;ible re&s;pect and reverence, a deep|er awe and veneration upon the minds of the people, is certainly a matter of no &s;mall importance.</P>
<P>And for dedicating Hou&s;es to the public wor&s;hip of God, and imploring his pre&s;ence and favourable acceptance of the prayers and prai&s;es offered up in them, we have the expre&s;s warrant of &s;cripture; par|ticularly in the account of Solomon's dedicating the Temple: For <HI>when Solomon had made an end of pray|ing</HI> (as a te&s;timony of divine approbation) <HI>the fire came down from heaven, and con&s;umed the burnt-offer|ing and the &s;acrifices; and the glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>filled the Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Now, &s;ome of the rea&s;ons (be&s;ides tho&s;e already mentioned) why God hath required, and is more e&s;pecially plea&s;ed with public wor&s;hip, are the&s;e; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>John&s;on</HI> in eundem.</NOTE> that as we are made &s;ocial beings, and are &s;en&s;ibly affected by each other, &s;o we are commonly more zealou&s;ly affected with what we tran&s;act in &s;ociety and fellow&s;hip one with another.&mdash;Again, as we all enjoy the &s;ame common ble&s;&s;ings, both temporal and &s;piritual; &s;o the&s;e enjoyments do mo&s;t certainly demand a common and &s;ocial return of prai&s;e. And as we all, in general, have the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ities; &s;o for the attainment of what we all equally need, it is, in all rea&s;on, mo&s;t fitting we &s;hould make our joint addre&s;&s;es and &s;upplications to God. And as public

wor&s;hip is our mo&s;t rea&s;onable &s;ervice, and is expre&s;|&s;ive of peculiar re&s;pect and veneration; &s;o nothing on earth is more beautiful and amiable, than an a&s;|&s;embly of rational creatures, joining together with one heart, and one voice, in offering up their grate|ful homage to their &s;upreme Lord and benefactor; as St. John, in the Revelations, repre&s;ents the wor|&s;hip of heaven, performed in the mo&s;t perfect man|ner, before the throne of God.&mdash;Such &s;ocial and public wor&s;hip tends to knit our hearts together in Chri&s;tian love and unity.</P>
<P>On &s;uch accounts as the&s;e, God doth require, and is, in an e&s;pecial manner, plea&s;ed with the public and united wor&s;hip of his creatures: And this is what oc|ca&s;ioned holy David to &s;ay, that <HI>one day &s;pent in the Hou&s;e of God, was better than a thou&s;and el&s;ewhere.</HI>&mdash; Indeed that our Maker is to be wor&s;hipped publicly, &mdash;that the more &s;olemn, general and unanimous, our adorations and acknowledgments of him are, the more are they for his honour, and the more becoming our duty; is not only the voice of revelation, but even of nature and rea&s;on: Which appears by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of mankind, in every age and na|tion; &s;o that there never have been any communities of men, who did not cultivate &s;ome kind of public religious wor&s;hip. And from the earlie&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity, it hath ever been the practice of its pro|fe&s;&s;ors (as appears from their con&s;tantly meeting on the fir&s;t day of the week, to break bread) unani|mou&s;ly to join, in devoting them&s;elves to God, in his &s;olemn wor&s;hip and &s;ervice. Accordingly St. Paul exhorts Chri&s;tians, <HI>not</HI> to <HI>for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of them|&s;elves together.</HI>&mdash;And we read that the Apo&s;tles <HI>lifted up their voice to God with one accord</HI>; and our Church is &s;o happy as to follow their excellent example. St.

Paul exhorts us, <HI>with one mind, and one mouth,</HI> to <HI>glorify God.</HI></P>
<P>But then public wor&s;hip requires &s;ome particular place for the performance of it. Private devotions may be performed in any place; though &s;ome are more convenient than others. We read that God is <HI>about our path, and about our bed:</HI> And the more &s;olitary the place, the better we may perform &s;uch addre&s;&s;es. But public wor&s;hip demands a decent Hou&s;e, a convenient reception for numbers to re&s;ort to, at &s;tated times; a building &s;et apart and di|&s;tingui&s;hed from common u&s;e, to which we may re|treat from the world and its cares. And &s;uch Hou&s;es being given up by us, as an offering to God, and devoted to his immediate &s;ervice, ought to be as commodious, elegant, and magnificent, as our abi|lities will admit of.</P>
<P>But if any are inclined to blame the cu&s;tom of the profe&s;&s;ors of the Church of England, for expen&s;ively adorning their Hou&s;es of public wor&s;hip, where they are able, I would a&s;k them, whether being &s;paring in our offerings to God, doth not manife&s;t, in <HI>us,</HI> as ungrateful, &s;ordid narrowne&s;s of &s;oul, and as great di&s;re&s;pect to our Maker, as was &s;hown by tho&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> of old, who <HI>offered</HI> up <HI>for &s;acrifice the blind and the lame,</HI> who&s;e offerings God abhorred? And is not a liberal offering to God, an indication of re&s;pect to him, and regard for the honour of religion? Did God, who changeth not, ever di&s;approve of the pro|digious magnificence, and co&s;tly ornaments of Solo|mon's Temple? And did he not, by the mouth of his prophet Haggai, &s;everely reprove his people for their &s;paring contributions to the &s;econd Temple? <HI>Is it time</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>for you, O ye, to dwell in your ceiled hou&s;es, and this Hou&s;e lie wa&s;te?

<P>That the Hou&s;e of God &s;hould be at lea&s;t com|modious, decent, clean, and comely, is what we might rea&s;onably expect everyone would approve of, who pretends to any reverence for God or religion. Saith the pious and worthy Dean Stanhope,
<Q>Far from us be all ornaments, mi&s;becoming the wor&s;hip of a &s;pirit, or the gravity of a Church. But &s;ure it hath a very ill a&s;pect, for men to be content|edly and &s;ordidly frugal, and to think <HI>that</HI> well enough in God's Hou&s;e, which they would not en|dure, even in the meane&s;t apartments of their own. Religion &s;hould not be dre&s;&s;ed in the habit of a wanton; but do not deny her that of a matron.&mdash; Let her be mode&s;t in her garb; but withal comely and clean; and allow her enough, not only to pro|tect her from &s;hame and contempt, but to draw &s;ome re&s;pect too. If &s;ome have injured her by a fal&s;e and too artificial beauty, this is no rea&s;on why we &s;hould think it a virtue, to turn pious clowns and &s;lovens, by running into the contrary extreme, and,</Q>
in&s;tead of <HI>wor&s;hipping the Lord in the beauty of holine&s;s,</HI> addre&s;s him "in the dirt and deformity" of &s;lovenline&s;s. If we are contented with meanne&s;s and ugline&s;s in the Hou&s;e of God, and being able, are however penuriou&s;ly unwilling to provide what is honourable for his wor&s;hip, though it be under pre|tence of regarding only <HI>&s;piritual wor&s;hip, heart wor|&s;hip,</HI> and the like; yet do we not tempt, nay, even provoke mankind to di&s;tru&s;t and ridicule our profe&s;|&s;ions of piety, and to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;ervice of God? And do we not al&s;o incur the peculiar indignation of heaven? <HI>If ye offer the blind for &s;acrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame and &s;ick, is it not evil? Offer

it now to thy Governor, will he be plea&s;ed with thee, or accept thy per&s;on? &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts.</HI> If we are willing to enjoy the be&s;t of every thing our&s;elves, and think any thing good enough for God's &s;ervice, we may call him <HI>Father, Lord,</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> or what we plea&s;e; yet the&s;e &s;entiments and proceedings are plain indications, that he is not the &s;upreme object of our love and reverence.</P>
<P>In the next place, as no rea&s;on can be given, why God &s;hould not be as graciou&s;ly pre&s;ent in each Hou&s;e, that we now dedicate to his wor&s;hip, as he was in the one Jewi&s;h Temple; &s;o the&s;e words of the Lord, ut|tered by the Prophet I&s;aiah (among many other te&s;ti|monies of &s;cripture) &s;eem fully to evince it: <HI>My Hou&s;e &s;hall be called the Hou&s;e of prayer for ALL peo|ple.</HI> By which the introduction of the Gentiles into the Church of God, is plainly foretold; and that what&s;oever Hou&s;e they &s;hould devote to his &s;ervice, and a&s;&s;emble in for wor&s;hip, &s;hould be called God's Hou&s;e of prayer, as the Jewi&s;h Temple was. And agreeable to this, St. Paul wrote to Timothy, who was then at Ephe&s;us, <HI>hoping,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to come unto thee &s;hortly; but if I tarry long, that thou maye&s;t know how thou oughte&s;t to behave thy&s;elf in the Hou&s;e of God, which is the Church of the living God.</HI> The&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle are a &s;ufficient explanation of tho&s;e recorded by the Prophet I&s;aiah, which were ju&s;t now mentioned.</P>
<P>Accordingly it is the cu&s;tom of the Church of England, when Hou&s;es are built and re&s;igned up to God for the purpo&s;es of his wor&s;hip, to a&s;&s;emble in them, and to join, with one accord, in public prayers and prai&s;es; to have &s;ermons preached &s;uit|able to tho&s;e occa&s;ions, in which public declarations are made, that tho&s;e Hou&s;es are devoted to God,&mdash;
<PB N="16" REF="012258_0020_0F8A6BFE95BD52A8">
dedicated to his religious wor&s;hip and &s;ervice, and from that time forward are to be e&s;teemed &s;acred to God and religion. The peculiar pre&s;ence of God is invoked, and his favourable attention to, and e&s;pe|cial ble&s;&s;ing upon tho&s;e per&s;ons, who &s;hall faithfully &s;eek him in tho&s;e places. This tends to make &s;uch places venerable in the eyes of men, and to draw down a divine ble&s;&s;ing on wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould be inclined to cavil, and &s;ay, not|with&s;tanding what hath been offered, that &s;uch form|al dedications are either needle&s;s or &s;uper&s;titious; I would recommend to their con&s;ideration, the grand &s;olemnity of dedicating Solomon's Temple, and the miraculous te&s;timony of divine approbation, con|&s;equent thereupon. And why are &s;uch dedications le&s;s proper now? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>South</HI> in eundem.</NOTE> Eu&s;ebius (the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian hi|&s;torian, after the Apo&s;tles) mentions the dedication of Churches, as generally practi&s;ed by the primitive Chri&s;tians. He tells us the particular manner in which this ceremony was performed, and &s;tiles it a cu&s;tom of the Church becoming God. In a word, all na|tions who have retained any venerable &s;entiments of God and religion (whether Chri&s;tians, Jews, or even heathens) have ever practi&s;ed &s;olemn, formal dedica|tions, when they &s;et apart Hou&s;es for religious wor&s;hip and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>But though, after our Churches are dedicated, we attribute no inherent holine&s;s to them, but only re|lative, as being &s;et apart from worldly u&s;es, and de|voted wholly to religious purpo&s;es, yet &s;ome are apt to accu&s;e us of having a &s;uper&s;titious regard for the Hou&s;es them&s;elves. Are they not wood and &s;tone, &s;ay they, as well as other buildings? I an&s;wer; this cavil is the language of that recent kind of refin|ed

and &s;piritualized piety, to which Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles were utter &s;trangers. Our Lord had &s;uch zeal for the honour of God's Hou&s;e, that he him&s;elf drove out of it the buyers, &s;ellers, and other invaders of it. And St. Paul reproved the Corin|thians, for profanely eating or fea&s;ting in their Churches. <HI>Have ye not hou&s;es to eat and drink in? Or de&s;pi&s;e ye the Church of God?</HI> &s;aid he.&mdash;I have now done with the fir&s;t general head of di&s;cour&s;e, and proceed to &s;how,</P>
<P N="2">II.

And &s;oon after God an&s;wered him, &s;aying, <HI>now mine eyes &s;hall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.</HI> And no rea&s;on can be given, why God &s;hould not be as well plea&s;ed <HI>now,</HI> with public wor|&s;hip in his own Hou&s;e, as he was under the Jewi&s;h oeconomy; for numbers publicly to a&s;&s;emble, in or|der to wor&s;hip God, is evidently a token of re&s;pect and reverence for him: But it is &s;till more &s;o, when they wait on him for that purpo&s;e, at his own Hou&s;e. And con&s;equently God will more graciou&s;ly hear and an&s;wer prayers and prai&s;es, when offered up in his Sanctuary, than el&s;ewhere. Public wor&s;hip, for &s;e|veral rea&s;ons, is extremely nece&s;&s;ary and becoming, (as I have &s;hown under the preceding head of this di&s;cour&s;e) and &s;o is peculiarly entitled to the divine attention and ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012258_0022_0F8A6C002469BB48">I have already proved that God is peculiarly pre&s;ent in Hou&s;es which are devoted to his wor&s;hip: But what other valuable purpo&s;e can his peculiar pre&s;ence there an&s;wer, or what el&s;e can be meant by it, but his being peculiarly ready to hear, an&s;wer, and ble&s;s tho&s;e who wor&s;hip him, as they ought to do, in his own Hou&s;e?

joining both with heart and voice, in paying homage to the Almighty King of glory in his own Sanctuary; that nothing on earth be&s;ides can &s;o nearly re&s;emble the tran&s;cendently glorious exerci&s;es of heaven.

Then will I go un|to the altar of God; unto God, my exceeding joy: Yea upon the harp will I prai&s;e thee, O God! my God!</HI> How earne&s;tly did the Prophet Daniel entreat his Maker that the Temple might be rebuilt? <HI>Cau&s;e thy
<PB N="23" REF="012258_0027_0F8A6C0697B8A990">
face to &s;hine upon thy Sanctuary, that is de&s;olate. Thy &s;er|vants take plea&s;ure in her &s;tones,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and favour the du&s;t thereof.</HI> They had a veneration for the very ruins of the Hou&s;e of God; and loved the meer du&s;t and rubbi&s;h of Sion, more than all the &s;ump|tuous palaces of Babylon. So ought you to regard and reverence this Hou&s;e, this Temple of the liv|ing God.</P>
<P>Now the very notion of reverential re&s;pect, pro|perly includes two things: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Warren</HI> in eundem.</NOTE> An inward e&s;teem of what we regard or reverence, and the expre&s;&s;ion of that e&s;teem by &s;uitable external actions. No one can pro|perly be &s;aid to reverence any thing, unle&s;s from his heart he bears a regard to it. Without this, all outward &s;how is but meer hypocri&s;y. And the e&s;teem ought always to be in proportion to the worthine&s;s of the object. There is a degree of re|verence due to God, which can be due to none <HI>but God:</HI> He ju&s;tly claims our &s;upreme veneration. But then his Hou&s;e, and every thing be&s;ides, that relates immediately to divine wor&s;hip, claim a low|er degree of our reverence and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the reverence which we owe to this Hou&s;e of God, doth not ari&s;e from the meer building it&s;elf; but from its being a place &s;olemnly dedicated to religious wor&s;hip; where we, as being his children, are to receive the ble&s;&s;ings of the Father of &s;pirits: And where, as being the work of his hands, we are to <HI>wor&s;hip, fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</HI> The inward e&s;teem and re|verence which is due to the Hou&s;e of God, is in &s;crip|ture expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t affectionate language:&mdash; <HI>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of ho&s;ts!</HI> &s;aid David. How hearty was the re&s;pect which our
<PB N="24" REF="012258_0028_0F8A6C07C4827310">
Saviour paid to the Temple, when, with a pious in|dignation, <HI>he ca&s;t out them that &s;old and bought therein?</HI> And while we remember the pious regard and zeal of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, for <HI>his Father's Hou&s;e of prayer,</HI> and reverence this Hou&s;e only on God's account; we need not be afraid of carrying our veneration for it too high. The danger, my brethren, is that you will not retain in your minds &s;uch a powerful &s;en&s;e of the holine&s;s of this Hou&s;e, and of the &s;pe|cial pre&s;ence of God in it, as becomes you. You are always to remember that the lofty Maje&s;ty of heaven is peculiarly pre&s;ent here; and that it is your duty to approach him with re&s;pectful awe; with godly fear and reverence, with an holy dread, and mo&s;t profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But this brings me to &s;peak of the other part of that reverence, which is due to the &s;acred Maje&s;ty of the invi&s;ible God, and to this edifice, wherein he is pecu|liarly pre&s;ent. This con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch actions or out|ward behaviour, as are mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of your inward re&s;pect, and venerable regard for them. And I en|treat you all to con&s;ider, that who&s;oever bears a &s;in|cere regard to any thing, will not fail, on proper occa&s;ions, to expre&s;s it, by his outward carriage and demeanour. When we &s;ee a man treat another with rudene&s;s or indifference; we do not fail to conclude that he wants a real re&s;pect for him. And &s;o, when you &s;ee a man behave in God's Hou&s;e of prayer with an air of vanity and irreverence, you may al&s;o rea&s;on|ably conclude, that he regards neither the Hou&s;e he is in, nor the pre&s;ence and authority of that being, who hath commanded him to <HI>keep his Sabbaths, and reve|rence his Sactuary.</HI></P>
<P>But, for creatures &s;o weak and degenerate, &s;o mean and &s;inful as we are, the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive po&s;|tures
<PB N="25" REF="012258_0029_0F8A6C0A9B6CD020">
that we are capable of, are hardly low and humble enough, when we approach the &s;upreme Ma|je&s;ty of heaven and earth, in his own Hou&s;e; a God of infinite holine&s;s, in who&s;e pre&s;ence the very angels, though a more noble order of beings than we are, and free from all guilt; yet are &s;aid to <HI>veil their faces,</HI> to expre&s;s their &s;olemn re&s;pect and reverence; and to <HI>bow down</HI> before him, in token of awful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Therefore, when&s;oever you a&s;&s;emble in this Hou&s;e for wor&s;hip, as a public acknowledgment of the mo&s;t high God, by no means allow your&s;elves in any idle, inatten|tive, irreverend ge&s;tures, le&s;t, under the hypocritical pretence of giving God your <HI>hearts,</HI> you afford him not even &s;o much as the &s;ervice of your <HI>bodies.</HI> And I entreat all tho&s;e, who are fearful of &s;howing the &s;u|preme God of heaven too much outward reverence and re&s;pect, to remember that <HI>he</HI> is the creator of their bodies as well as their &s;ouls: That <HI>he</HI> pre&s;erves and &s;upports them both; and that <HI>he</HI> requires, and hath an equal right to the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of both. <HI>Glorify God in your body,</HI> &s;aith St. Paul, <HI>and in your &s;pirit, which are God's.</HI> And again &s;aith he, <HI>I be&s;eech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye pre&s;ent your bodies a living &s;acrifice, holy and accepta|ble unto God, which is your rea&s;onable &s;ervice.</HI> Such a &s;ervice is very agreeable to rea&s;on, which teaches us, that he who made the body, hath a right to the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of it.</P>
<P>One would think experience alone &s;ufficient to prove to a Chri&s;tian, the efficacy of a &s;erious, humble, outward deportment of the body, in order to excite and cheri&s;h in the &s;oul a &s;incere and lively devotion. Chri&s;t, our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, who did not come into the world to encourage &s;uper&s;tition; yet, when he earne&s;tly prayed, ju&s;t before his crucifixion, that <HI>if

it were po&s;&s;ible, that cup might pa&s;s from him,</HI> did not refu&s;e the mo&s;t humble po&s;ture: but <HI>kneeled down up|on the ground.</HI> And can any who pretend to <HI>name the name of Chri&s;t,</HI> refu&s;e to follow his example? Will they pre&s;ume to addre&s;s God with le&s;s deference than his own Son our Lord and Ma&s;ter did! Will they dare to be &s;o rude and indecent, &s;o bold and un|becoming, when they are in the &s;pecial pre&s;ence of the &s;acred Maje&s;ty of heaven, as to compo&s;e them|&s;elves into a &s;leepy po&s;ture, or behave them&s;elves as carele&s;ly as though they were in their own hou&s;es, without appearing to have the lea&s;t veneration for God's Sanctuary, and the wor&s;hip of their Maker, who can de&s;troy them in a moment, with the breath of his mouth! Is it not, my brethren, prodigious &s;trange, that men, while they pretend to honour God, &s;hould affront him to his face! But it is &s;till more wonderful, if po&s;&s;ible, that any of the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity &s;hould be deluded with &s;uch fal&s;e no|tions of reverence, as to imagine that their outward behaviour, &s;uch as <HI>kneeling at prayers, bowing at the name of Je&s;us,</HI> in the rehear&s;al of what they believe, <HI>&s;tanding up</HI> when the P&s;alms are read or &s;ung, and the like, is &s;o far from being any part of religious reve|rence, or divine wor&s;hip, as ju&s;tly to de&s;erve the name of &s;uper&s;tition! Not con&s;idering that the wor&s;hip of the body, is as really our duty as that of the &s;oul: And that it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for our &s;ouls to be well affected and piou&s;ly devout, while we do <HI>wilfully</HI> or <HI>&s;cornfully</HI> refu&s;e to honour and reverence God with our bodies, in the manner that St. Paul exhorts us to do.</P>
<P>Therefore, my brethren, I do entreat you, by no means to neglect bodily wor&s;hip, which is your indi&s;pen&s;able duty, and very u&s;eful to recall your
<PB N="27" REF="012258_0031_0F8A6C0E0E500830">
wandering thoughts, to the exerci&s;es of inward devo|tion, and to increa&s;e and keep up your religious zeal and piety. Be very careful to avoid all in|decent, carele&s;s, indifferent, lolling, &s;lovenly ge&s;tures, in the public wor&s;hip of Almighty God. Do not &s;tand up when you are commanded to kneel, nor &s;it down when the rules of the common prayer re|quire you to &s;tand; but know a&s;&s;uredly, that all incli|nation to oppo&s;e the&s;e rules and orders is irregular, and proceeds either from inattention, lazine&s;s, indif|ference, a di&s;putatious temper of mind, or from that perver&s;e pride and ob&s;tinacy, which are owing to the vile &s;ugge&s;tions of the great enemy of man|kind.</P>
<P>A mind truly pious and devout, will unavoidably &s;how its &s;incerity, by an humble, religious, and re|verential deportment of body in the Hou&s;e of God. And I think it mu&s;t be morally impo&s;&s;ible, for men, who have a &s;incere regard for religion, to come to Church, without di&s;covering, while in the peculiar pre&s;ence of their Maker, &s;ome tokens of religious re|verence, in their bodily behaviour. A &s;incerely good man is &s;en&s;ible of the great duty and advantage of waiting upon God in his Hou&s;e: He &s;o well con&s;i|ders his own infirmities, and hath &s;o &s;olemn a vene|ration for the divine pre&s;ence, that, while he is in the exerci&s;e of devotion, and all the time that he remains in the Hou&s;e of God, he imagines no care nor cir|cum&s;pection too great, for the &s;uitable conduct both of body and &s;oul. Whereas many people attend public wor&s;hip in God's Sanctuary, with &s;uch a care|le&s;s indifference, as amounts to a &s;trong indication of a wicked and perver&s;e, of an ob&s;tinate and pro|fane temper of mind: So that we have ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, and fear, that the inward di&s;po&s;ition of
<PB N="28" REF="012258_0032_0F8A6C0EF75F5E88">
their &s;ouls is of the very &s;ame ca&s;t with the haughty negligence, and lazy indecency, of their bodily de|portment.</P>
<P>But,
<Q>in order to your duly reverencing this Sanc|tuary</Q>
of the mo&s;t high God, you mu&s;t behave in it
<Q>with that inward piety, and that outward hu|mility, which &s;o augu&s;t a pre&s;ence, and &s;o mo|mentous a concern, require of you.</Q>
And that ye may do the&s;e things the better, you ought to pre|pare your&s;elves well beforehand: Which is pecu|liarly proper for <HI>us</HI> of the Church of England, &s;ince we may know, before we begin, exactly what we have to do: And have therefore a great advan|tage in preparing for the due performance of it.</P>
<P>When you offer up your public addre&s;&s;es to God in this Hou&s;e, though the words are ready prepared for you to utter, yet you have enough to employ you, in pre&s;enting them to the throne of grace, with zealous attention and undi&s;turbed devotion. They only, who heartily and affectionately offer up to God the words which they u&s;e (whether by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a book, or without) can be truly &s;aid to pray as they ought. But &s;ince we are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ak and imperfect creatures, un|able to tran&s;act many things at one and the &s;ame time, it is evidently mo&s;t proper for us, when we publicly wor&s;hip God in his own Hou&s;e, to have nothing el&s;e to do, for the exerci&s;e of the &s;oul, but to employ it in offering up, with fervent devo|tion, what we have very often con&s;idered, and do well under&s;tand: That we may not &s;pend our time in &s;tudying how to tickle each other's ears, and rack our heads with invention, while our hearts ought to glow with the mo&s;t &s;olemn devotion: And that we may not be employed in con&s;idering the new peti|tions which we hear, and whether they are fit for
<PB N="29" REF="012258_0033_0F8A6C0F2B562D60">
us to join in, while we ought to do homage to God with our voices, and to reverence him with the warm affections of our hearts. He that u&s;eth our liturgy in public wor&s;hip, with that holy devotion of &s;oul which he ought,
<Q>can never complain that forms of prayer &s;tint the &s;pirit, or make men lazy and idle.</Q></P>
<P>To make you &s;incerely good and pious, whether you will or no, is not in the power of the Church of England. All our Church can do, is to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, in the be&s;t manner, concerning your devotions, and to lead you in the &s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t direct cour&s;e to heaven. And this &s;he hath done with peculiar wi&s;dom and piety. And if you comply with her di|rections, you will reap the ble&s;&s;ed benefit, and rejoice in &s;o great a privilege. But if you will not ob&s;erve the rules pre&s;cribed, and accordingly &s;hould not receive any manner of <HI>good</HI> to your &s;ouls; yet that will not be the fault of the Church, but entirely your own.&mdash; Therefore I exhort and intreat you all, for the ho|nour of Chri&s;tianity, for the glory of God, and for the benefit of your own immortal &s;ouls, to make a right u&s;e of our public liturgy. In order to which, you mu&s;t often peru&s;e it; take care to under&s;tand it; and prepare your&s;elves for the due performance of <HI>your part</HI> in it. And to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, I will now, in a few words, explain to you the right u&s;e of our morning and evening &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Our public devotions begin with two or three &s;hort &s;entences of &s;cripture, expre&s;&s;ive of our wicked|ne&s;s, and of the mercy of God: After which is pro|nounced by the mini&s;ter, "a &s;erious exhortation to repentance;" that the minds of the people may be impre&s;&s;ed with a humble &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins, that they may recollect their many iniquities, and that they
<PB N="30" REF="012258_0034_0F8A6C0FD6DEBC80">
may be properly di&s;po&s;ed to enter upon the great du|ty of repentance: Accordingly, then followeth a general confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, imploring forgivene&s;s; to be &s;aid by the whole congregation, by mini&s;ter and people alternately, with a &s;olemn voice, <HI>all kneeling,</HI> and with a truly humble and penitent heart. After which, the prie&s;t alone uttereth the ab&s;olution; which is a declaration that God will be merciful to all true penitents. And when this is performed, the remembrance of God's mercy will tend to make us &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, dutiful, and thankful. Then we may, with comfortable a&s;&s;urance, call God our Father, in that form which Chri&s;t hath taught us. Accordingly the mini&s;ter and people, all as one, repeat the Lord's prayer. Thus the hone&s;t Churchman, the pious Chri&s;tian, receives divine comfort in the Hou&s;e of God. For though he frequently offendeth through the infirmity of his nature; yet he doth as often re|pent, and always, when he is in the Sanctuary, implore pardon. And &s;o, by con&s;tantly mortifying and bewailing his &s;ins, he obtains an habitual aver|&s;ion to them: And from the &s;incerity of his repent|ance, derives a joyful hope of pardon, and of the favour of his Maker, through the gracious medi|ation of his kind Redeemer.</P>
<P>The P&s;alms, which con&s;i&s;t chiefly in prai&s;es, come next in our liturgy: And in order to the due per|formance of this part of our wor&s;hip, we mu&s;t frequently and attentively con&s;ider the Maje&s;ty and goodne&s;s of God. And our minds, being properly affected therewith, will be prepared to hear, with dutiful attention, the portions of &s;cripture read by the mini&s;ter: And we &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to receive them as &s;poken to our&s;elves; &s;ince <HI>all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God; and is profitable for doctrine, for
<PB N="31" REF="012258_0035_0F8A6C108FDEF530">
reproof, for correction, and in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> &mdash;And if we are thankful to God, as we ought to be, for the light of revelation, we &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to utter, with a heavenly tran&s;port of joy and devo|tion, among others, that mo&s;t divine anthem,
<Q>we prai&s;e thee, O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.</Q>
Thus we &s;hall <HI>&s;erve the Lord with gladne&s;s,</HI> prai&s;e him publicly with chearfulne&s;s, and take peculiar delight in the courts of the Hou&s;e of our God.</P>
<P>The remaining part, both of our morning and evening &s;ervice, doth mo&s;t intimately concern our temporal and eternal intere&s;t: And con&s;i&s;ts in a num|ber of petitions, for all tho&s;e good things which we need, relating both to <HI>this</HI> life, and to <HI>that</HI> which is to come. And that we may perform this part of our public &s;ervice to God's acceptance, and by his ble&s;&s;ing obtain what we a&s;k for, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that we pray with faith and humility: And be al&s;o well per&s;uaded, that we a&s;k for nothing but what is both lawful and expedient. And in order to this, we mu&s;t frequently and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what it is we pray for. Therefore it is very nece&s;|&s;ary for you to read and examine, with diligent at|tention, the common prayers, and the &s;everal di|rections contained in the rubricks. And I a&s;&s;ure you, that the liturgy of the Church of England is the be&s;t collection, both of prayers, and rules for public wor&s;hip, that can be found among all human compo&s;itions. And as you have the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance for publicly wor&s;hipping the &s;upreme Lord of the univer&s;e, that human wi&s;dom hath ever yet contriv|ed; &s;o it will greatly increa&s;e your condemnation, if you neglect to make a good u&s;e of it.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="012258_0036_0F8A6C1147A09F18">I &s;hall not, at this time, undertake to con&s;ider, in any particular manner, the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from our &s;olemn and divine method of wor&s;hip, for the &s;ake of extemporary prayers, and undige&s;ted effu|&s;ions. Let me only ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e who com|plain, that they cannot be religiou&s;ly devout in our form of wor&s;hip, will hardly be &s;incerely &s;o in their own.</P>
<P>He that intimately knows the &s;ecrets of all hearts, ought not to be addre&s;&s;ed with ra&s;hne&s;s and incon&s;i|deration: Nor to be treated with idlene&s;s or wanton|ne&s;s. But we mu&s;t pray with faith and zealous attention, with humble reverence and &s;incere devo|tion, in order to meet with divine acceptance. And he that is not affected with the humility, &s;olemnity and piety of the public prayers of the Church of England, mu&s;t, I am &s;ure, be either &s;tupidly inattentive, or perver&s;ely &s;tubborn, or perhaps otherwi&s;e extremely vicious in his di&s;po&s;ition and behaviour.</P>
<P>And as to bodily wor&s;hip, it mu&s;t be very impro|per to leave every one to follow all the whims that can be &s;tarted by his own private fancy, either to &s;it, &s;tand, or kneel, ju&s;t as he plea&s;es. Therefore, like a wife and good mother, tenderly concerned for the true intere&s;t of her &s;piritual children, our Church hath directed and commanded us, to behave in each part of our public wor&s;hip, as &s;he judged to be mo&s;t becoming. When we earne&s;tly implore the greate&s;t of mercies, &s;uch as the forgivene&s;s of our &s;ins, the influences of the divine &s;pirit, deliverance from all calamities, the continual pre&s;ervation of our &s;ouls, of our bodies and e&s;tates, and the mercy and favour of God towards others, we are required to kneel. While the word of God is read or preached to us, we are allowed to &s;it down, provided we are &s;erious and
<PB N="33" REF="012258_0037_0F8A6C12085BA9E8">
attentive, and behave with proper decency. And when we are rehear&s;ing the creeds, which contain the &s;ub&s;tance of our Chri&s;tian belief, or while &s;ome part of the go&s;pel, particularly adapted to the &s;ea&s;on, is read to us, we are commanded to &s;tand up, in token of re&s;pectful reverence. And, at all times, when we either read or &s;ing the prai&s;es of God, as they are contained in the P&s;alms, or tho&s;e Hymns which we u&s;e, let us by no means refu&s;e to &s;tand up, which is the mo&s;t becoming po&s;ture for than&s;giving and prai&s;e. David exhorts to <HI>prai&s;e the Lord</HI>&mdash;STANDING <HI>in the Lord's Hou&s;e.</HI> And we read, concerning the wor&s;hip at the dedication of Solomon's Temple, that when <HI>the Prie&s;ts and Levites prai&s;ed the Lord&mdash;all I&s;rael</HI> STOOD. Therefore, my brethren, you ought &s;trictly to conform to all the rules and directions of the Church of England, re&s;pecting public wor&s;hip, &s;ince they are agreeable to the highe&s;t rea&s;on, plainly warranted by &s;acred &s;cripture, and the mo&s;t of them no le&s;s than divine commands.&mdash;I need not explain to you any more of the particulars of our wor&s;hip: They are all to be found di&s;tinctly &s;et down in the Common Prayer-Book; to that I refer you.</P>
<P>After what hath been &s;aid, is it not &s;urpri&s;ing, that any &s;hould be &s;o &s;tubborn and di&s;obedient, as to di&s;|&s;ent from the directions of our liturgy, which are &s;o wi&s;e and rational; or from our method of wor&s;hip, which is &s;o ea&s;y and becoming, &s;o pious and humble, &s;o plain, beautiful and &s;olemn? Since the wor&s;hip of the Church of England doth agree &s;o exactly with rea&s;on, with the commands, exhortations, and pious examples which are recorded in holy &s;cripture; let it be &s;uitably impre&s;&s;ed on your minds, that if you wil|fully refu&s;e to comply with it, you will mo&s;t certain|ly incur the vengeance of heaven, for di&s;obedience to
<PB N="34" REF="012258_0038_0F8A6C14080BFF60">
your proper governors, both in Church and State: Becau&s;e your compliance with the liturgy, is required and commanded by the authority of both; whom you are bound to obey in every thing that they enjoin, which is not forbidden by the laws of God. But though I accu&s;e people of irreverence, for not &s;tanding when public prai&s;es or thank&s;givings are offered up, or for not kneeling in the time of &s;olemn public prayer; yet I know very well, that many will &s;peak of the&s;e attitudes as matters of indifference, notwith&s;tanding they are both ab&s;olutely commanded in holy writ, and are al&s;o agreeable to the con&s;tant example of all the &s;cripture worthies. But &s;uppo&s;e they were indiffer|ent, one might rea&s;onably imagine, that no wi&s;e or good man would run the ri&s;que of drawing upon him&s;elf the di&s;plea&s;ure of heaven, for not complying with the commands of lawful authority, in what is &s;o ea&s;y to be performed, and in what he confe&s;&s;eth to be indifferent, and &s;o not &s;inful. <HI>Submit your&s;elves,</HI> faith St. Peter, <HI>to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake.</HI>&mdash;And to the &s;ame effect are the following words of St. Paul, <HI>let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher power; for there is no power but of God: The powers that be are ordained of God. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;t|eth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God: And they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation.</HI></P>
<P>You may, with very little trouble, &s;tand and kneel in public wor&s;hip, as you are commanded: But the evils which you incur by refu&s;ing &s;o to do, are great. A &s;mall portion of knowledge, with an hone&s;t, humble, and obedient heart, renders us ca|pable of the &s;piritual graces of the Holy Gho&s;t. But when we wilfully and &s;tubbornly refu&s;e to comply with the ordinances both of God and men; and <HI>hew out</HI> for our&s;elves <HI>broken ci&s;terns,</HI> by our own invention;
